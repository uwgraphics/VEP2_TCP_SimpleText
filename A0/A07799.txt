LONDINI, Impensis Georg. Bishop and Ioh. Norton. 1609.

TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE, JAMES BY THE GRACE OF GOD KING of great
Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the faith.
AMongst all the books, which of long time have been published by the Roman
press (most renowned and gracious Sovereign) the late Apology of the Roman
church may seem both in the Prefaces, and progress thereof to have deserved
your Majesty's most favorable acceptance. In the diverse Prefaces whereof your
Majesty is saluted in those due, and almost proper attributes of In the
Epistle dedicatory to the Parliament.

Which public peremptorinesse these Apologists may seem by this their more
ingenuous dealing to check and control, except that they will be thought to
have uttered the voices Temporum potius quam hominum.

Concerning their progress. Although the Apology be far from that
absoluteness, which the publisher thereof pretends, who judges it to be in
some things demonstratiuely unanswerable, as other Romanists do likewise
conceive: yet notwithstanding whatsoever Argument of singular moment is used in
the volumes of the Romish Doctors, or what colorable accordance soever has
proceeded from the pen of any learned Protestant, which appeared in any degree
aduantagious unto their Roman cause; that seems herein to have been
collected, urged, and reinforced against us with as singular choice of matter,
with as ponderous weight of consequence, with an as exact and exquisite a
method and style, together with as sober a temper of speech, as they by their
diligence, judgment, wit, Art, and moderation could easily perform.

This seen, forthwith our most reverend, careful, and religious Metropolitan
commanded a certain number of Divines, then at hand, to employ their studies
for the perfecting of a satisfiable Reply: which had accordingly been
sufficiently accomplished, had not the heat of the common sickness, and other
their importunate occurrences hindered their endeavors. At what time the
burden (my occasions then better sorting) did (yet not by choice but by
chance) fall upon me, the weakest and unworthiest of those parties assigned:
which, notwithstanding, after a due perusal of the Apology, I did at length
undergo, not upon presumption of any singular dexterity in my self, but as in
confidence that God would enable me hereunto, he being In minimis maximus, and
often choosing the weak things to confound the strong: so also upon an
experience that diverse Romish Doctors would be at hand ready to lend me herein
their best support.

Which kind of assistance of learned Adversaries the Apologists themselves In
the Epistle dedicatory to your Majesty.
have laid down for the greatest reason of satisfaction, and we do accordingly
admit. For if it be held an excellent point of physic, Ex Vipera theriacum,

to cut all knots of arguments with Alexanders sword, and to beat them down
with Hercules club, rather than to labor to appease and moderate contentions
by the harp of Apollo: that is, rather to repress them by violence, than to
have them moderated by art and judgment: this man was a Boanergis. As for the
Apologists, we may presume that they cannot speak more iudiciously than they
have writ, whose accusations and arguments are in this Appeal (so far as we
have proceeded) expressed word by word, and satisfied from the testimonies of
the Roman Authors themselves, with that care and diligence, that no
Adversary, I hope, shall have much cause to except against it: Sure I am with
that sincerity, as not to become an Adversary unto my self by erring against
my conscience. For to say that I have not possibly erred at all, were to
advance my self above the nature of man: but to have erred wilfully in any
thing were to be less than a Christian. In a word such as my confidence in
this work, that (...) I do vow thy self unto does for the Roman cause, if
any of that profession shall orderly and sufficiently refute the (...) of this
Appeal. Only I shall desire every such Replier to use the same moderation in

them BRETHREN whether they will or no, so long as they say, OUR FATHER in
invocation of one God, and do celebrate the same Sacraments which we do, and
answer, although not with us, the same AMEN. Nothing now remains (dear
Christian) but that we beseech God to illuminate us in the knowledge of his
will, and to sanctify us both in our souls and bodies in the constant
profession of the holy faith, to the glory of his saving grace in Christ
Jesus: In whom

Pleases it the courteous Reader furthermore to understand a Mystery.
A Letter was sent me by M. Roger Brereley, together with a book of M. John
Brereley, being the second edition of their Roman Apology: the tenor of
which Letter follows.

To the worshipful M. Doctor Morton, Deane of Gloucester, these be delivered
with all speed possible.
Worshipful Master Doctor, I have met by good chance with this book, which I
send you here enclosed: I take it to be another Edition of that book, which I
understand you are in answering, which is the cause that I make so much speed
to send you it, lest that you should have committed some ouersights, which are
discovered in this, and may tend to your great disgrace, if you use not due
prevention. It seems to me not to be an easy matter to satisfy any
judicious Reader, for this Author is very exact, and quoteth your own Authors,
which are extant, and cannot be denied: and if you should not answer very
directly, but run to other not so pertinent discourses, I fear your credit^
will not be a little stained. I wish you well, but my chief desire is that
truth may be discovered in such important affairs as these are. Wherefore be
sure to help to set forward this, or else suppress your books, and impose
silence to your self. And I will be glad to hear of your best resolutions,
and ever rest

Your loving friend, Roger Brereley.


My Answer.
I Received this letter, being without date, and brought unto my lodging by a
messenger, who meant for that present to be without name, promising to retume
the next day, but did not, except it were without appearance. The book was
printed, Anno 1608. but was not tendered unto me until Anno 1609, October 28.
being the next day after that I had presented this my Appeal unto his
Majesty. And is it credible that master Roger Brereley should only by chance
happen upon their so famous an Apology, not until almost a year after it was
printed? Shall we think that there could be no better correspondence between
these two, brothers (as I am informed) both by Priesthood and blood? Or can any
imagine that he seeking to premonish me with all speed possible, could find no
possible means of conueyance in almost a years space? I cannot think that he
was then amongst the Antipodes, but rather antepedes, whose letters, sent for
the prevention of this Appeal, were not delivered unto me, before the very day
next following the publication thereof. Discourteously (I might have said,
unconscionably) done: even to this (...)


An answer to the exceptions made against me in the second Edition of this
Romish Apology.
The first, page 10. line 16. My calling of a Loyal Roman subject a white
Ethiopian, you should have added, In a Protestant state: and have understood,
with me, such Romanists only as are led by those guides, whose positions were
there discovered to be altogether rebellious; but consult you with your self,
and then tell me, I pray you, of what color that loyalty is, which denies
the oath of Allegiance?

The second, page 18. I, indeed, excused this saying of Calvin, When Kings
command any thing against God, they berea^e themselves of all authority;
showing that he meant not thereby that they were absolutely no Kings; but so
far only as they commanded any thing against God, in such a case not man but
God must be obeyed. This (say you) is unworthy D. Mortons judgment, and
learning. And why? I will still stand to my former promise, which was utterly
to abandon Calvin his judgment, if my exposition of his words be not
euincible out of the place of Calvin: viz. Daniel will not obey King Darius
forbidding him to pray unto the true God: he is therefore cast unto the Lions:
God delivers him: the king is glad, and Daniel said unto the king, O king
live for ever. etc. Daniel disobeyed Darius his unlawful command, and therein
only did not acknowledge his authority, which otherwise he did still honor
and proclaim, saying from his heart (says Calvin) O king live for ever: or,
God send thee a long reign. What can be more plain?

The third, page 180. That which you object concerning Syricius, is confuted
from your own Authors in this Appeal. See lib. 4. cap. 9.. 1. etc.

The fourth, page 443. (note *) in the marg. I alleged nothing but the
testimony of your Alfonsus de Castro. You say it is unfitting. Try this.
Cardinal Bellarmine denied that any did mox cognoscere Lutherum, that is,
presently acknowledge Luther, at his first renouncing of Popery. Alfonsus
names diverse, qui illum expectasse videntur, and statim illi adhaeserunt;
that is, who might seem to have expected him before he came, and as soon as
he was come did clean unto him.

The Memorandum, that the Treatise of the Kingdom of Israel, and of the
Church, dedicated unto Q. Elizabeth, was the work of another Tho. Morton, who
was of Christ's College: for I never published any book in her Majesty's reign.
last exception, page 740. in the margent, you charge me with frauds out of the
testimony of Delrio the Jesuit, concerning the devils apparition unto an
Abbot, persuading him to say Mass. Which my error in that allegation I
confessed in mine own Animaduersions, at the end of my Apology, and repaired
it with another example of the same kind out of the same Author Delrio:
therefore this your taxation might have bin left unto your M. Theoph. M.
Higgons objected the same error. See my answer unto him, page 8.
Higgons. I pray you, good M. Breerly, know that this manner of dealing cannot
consist with any modest Reply. Our Lord Jesus bless us to the glory of his
saving grace.

Yours, THO. MORTON.

Protestants, converted us Englishmen (by the preaching of Austine) from
heathenish infidelity to the faith of Christ.

Concerning the religion professed by Gregory, and whereunto we were as then
by him so converted, it was so undoubtedly our now professed Catholic faith,
that the Protestant writers (not of vulgar note, but those that are for
learning reputed most accomplished) do for such throughout every particular
specially and a^ large In proof that our then conversion was to every
particular point of our now professed Catholic faith, M. D^ctor Humfrey in
Iesuitismi, part. 2. rat. 5. page 626. and 627. says: In Ecclesiam vero quid
inuexerunt Gregorius and Augustinus? on us ceremon^arum, etc. ^ntulerunt

Altaria, Vestes, Imagines, Missas, Calices, Cruces, Candelabra, Thuribula,
Vexilla, sacra Vasa, Lustrales aquas, Romanarum ceremoniarum codices, etc. And
ibid. page 288. prope finem, he says of Gregory: In pluribus articulis
turpiter and pontificie hallucinatus est: nam and libero arbitrio and bonis
operibus nimium tribuit, de poenitentia non recte docet, coelibatum ministrorum
Ecclesiae acriter vrsit, inuocationem Sanctorum eorumque cultum, sed and
imaginum idolatricam venerationem approbauit, palliauit and defendit. Also the
Centurie writers of Magdeburg in their sixth Centurie, ca. 10. c. l. 748. circa
med make like report of Austines doctrine to us Englishmen. And collecting
(elsewhere in the same book) out of Gregory's own writings by them recited,
certain his opinions which they hold for erroneous, as being Popish, they do
in their Index or alphabeticall Table of that sixth Centurie, at the word
Gregorij, specially set down (with figures of particular reference where every
such said opinion is to be found, as follows:) Eiusde^^ error de bonis
operthus, de Confessione, de Coniugio, de Ecclesia, de Sanctorum inuocatione,
de Inferno, de Iustificatione, de Libero arbitrio, de Poenitentia, de

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
2 Why these Apologists should deal thus preposterously, as knowing that their
own Master Parsons, Treatise of Three conuersions.
Jesuit did sometime glory (although inconsideratly) of Three conuersions of
England from Paganism by Romish Bishops; they should begin to fasten the line
of their Demonstrations at the last, it might peradventure be coniectured. But
we rather hasten to disable their first presumption, whereby they have assumed
to manifest S. Gregory to be a peculiar patron of their now professed Romish
faith: and first we show,

That our Romish adversaries themselves have taken manifold exceptions to the
judgment of S. Gregory.
SECT. 3.
3 Although we have no cause to envy the just praises of S. Gregory, or to
diminish the opinion of his greatness, who was so far eminent above his
successors both in life and doctrine, that the unworthiness of their qualities
has confirmed unto him the title of Great: notwithstanding our Apologists do
herein wrong our good meaning, and pervert our ingenuous praises of Gregory
his virtues, to the countenancing and authorizing of his imperfections. We are
therefore enforced to let them understand, that we intended not to grace him
either as a Prophet, or as an Apostle, whose records and writings only were
privileged from error, but as a Father of the Church, who lived in a
declining Testimonia Patrum ^eptimae aetatis, S Gregorij, etc. Bellarm. lib 2

age, and came behind many of his predecessors as in time, so in some truth.
To whose writings our adversaries themselves take so many exceptions, that they
may not challenge us to embrace all his opinions.

Baronius witnesses) ^uch was the barrenness of learning in the days of S.
Gregory, that not only he himself was utterly ignorant of the Greek tongue,
but that hardly there could be any in Italy found, who was expert both in
Greek and Latin. A matter very considerable, especially when we call to
remembrance what happened before the days of S. Gregory in the Council of
Arimin: where (as their famous In Concilio Ariminensi cum simpliciores
Catholici, ab Arianis decepti* nomen (...) tollendum esse decreuissent; mox
Arian^ to^o orb terrarum praedicauerunt se vicisle, non cont^nti (...) (...),

Cardinal has truly reported from Theodoret) The Arrian heretics in stead
of the Greek word Homousion, the orthodoxall term of faith, suggest^d
heretically another Greek word Homoiousion; by which term, being in it self
no less different in sense, then agreeable in sound, the heretics abusing
the ignorance of the Catholic Bishops there present, did openly diuulge and
proclaim themselves conquerors. So that such like ignorance cannot be an
absolute moderator or counselor in all divine causes.

5 Nevertheless this observation could not have been so prejudicial unto the
judgment of S. Gregory, if their own Doctors had not further taxed him as

wholly burning some of his books: for although this was done upon envy, yet
could he not have offered unto the memory of his predecessor such an hateful
brand, which is proper unto the books of heretics, without pretense of some
doctrine, at least in show, new and erroneous. Which act of one Pope against
another may more then probably prove, that about the days of S. Gregory the
writings and Decrees of Popes were not received for undoubted determinations of
truth.

6 Wherefore, albeit it has pleased God to preserve the books of S. Gregory,
together with the learned monuments of ancient Fathers, for the better
direction of his Church: yet knowing that their own Doctors have been bold to
note (how worthily we need not determine) diverse his defects both in learning
and judgment, by a too credulous approbation of vulgar Miracles, too violent
an interpretation of divine Scriptures, too rigorous censure against Marriage,

7 Howsoever, we have not related such like his escapes in desperation of our
own cause, as though S. Gregory would appear an adversary against us; but
that our Apologists may permit unto Protestants upon as good, or rather better
reason, to use that liberty, which their own Doctors have practiced, being in
effect no more then that which their learned Durand teaches us to observe, to
wit, that See ab^ue letter, 1.
Seeing S. Gregory was no God, he might err as a man.

8 And now we proceed to discuss the Minor proposition, wherein they have
promised to prove that S. Gregory taught their now Romish doctrine in every
particular. In their manner of performance whereof they have made a triple
forfeit of their credit: because we shall demonstrate, first, that S. Gregory
did not patronize their profession in all these alleged particulars: secondly,
that in many of these he was an adversary thereunto: thirdly, that there be
many other Romish articles by them omitted, which S. Gregory did either
renounce, or else not acknowledge. That these may appear, we first descend
into an en^uirie of their objected particulars, dividing them into Articles of
substance, and ceremony: and in the first place examine,

CHAP. II. How far the objected Exceptions, which Protestants have taken
against the doctrine of S. Gregory, may appear justifiable in doctrinall
points.
SECT. 1.
1 Although we willingly confess that S. Gregory was an happy father of the
faith of many, and delivered to them the saving knowledge of Christ crucified:
nevertheless as some parents and nources with their milk, the food of life,
do ordinarily transfuse some insensible seeds of their own hereditarie
infirmities, which in time grow upon their children, and become both sensible
and dangerous, unless they be purged out: so it must be acknowledged of this
spiritual father, that together with the substantial doctrine of holy faith,
his scholars and conuerts might receive some few of his infirmities and
superstitions; which, like hereditarie diseases, increasing with time, and
growing stronger, ought not therefore to be still cherished, because they are
hereditary. We will begin with those particulars, which they account most
especial in Gods worship: a principal point herein is,

Concerning the Romish Mass.
SECT. 2.
2 For proof that S. Gregory did patronize the Romish Mass, these Apolog lit*
d.
Apologists have alleged the testimony of the Protestants called the
Centurists: but with what obliquitie and error of their own judgment, the
very place objected will manifest; Gregorius de coenae materia rect docet,
verum Missas and obl^tiones creber^^me inculcat. Centur. li^. ^. cap. 10 page
682.
The doctrine of S. Gregory (say the Centurists) which concerns the matter of
the Supper, is very sound, only he makes often mention of Mass and
oblations. By which word [matter] they evidently signify, that they justify
his judgment in behalf of his doctrine in this point, and only except
against the novelty of these terms, Mass and Oblations. It is no small (...)

^^^^testants do not take exception unto the word Sacrifice, as unlawful in it
self, but only as being found by experience to be less convenient, and
growing to be an occasion of the abuse of after times: otherwise Protestants do

Coenam multis mod^s Sacrificium dici posse. Bellarm. lib 1. de Missa, cap. 5.
grant (as their own learned Cardinal Bellarmine has truly observed) that
the Supper of the Lord may in diverse respects be called a Sacrifice. Vain
therefore is the purpose of these disputers, who, from a difference only about
a word, labor to enforce a confirmation of a different doctrine. They should
rather have examined their own principles, published by their own learned

Cardinal; and understanding from him, that the essence of a sacrifice
consists not in oblations and offertures, whether before or after
consecration, but only in these two acts, viz. the consecration of the elements
by words, and participation of them by eating: they may Neither may they object
a defect in the Minister: for some Protestants have been Romish priests; nor
yet in the form of consecration, for S. Gregory, lib de Sacram. Qui pridie
quam pateretur, uses the same tenor of repetition, Hoc est corpus, etc, and
of the Lords prayer.
justly collect that Protestants using the same sorme of consecration, which
Christ, and his Apostles, together with the succeeding Fathers did, and the
same manner of eating, do omit no essential part of their pretended Sacrifice;
whereof we are to discuss more at large in due See hereafter lib. 3. c. 7.
place. As for the present, we must understand that the now Romish Sacrifice
can have no being without their imagined Transubstantiation. Therefore our
third question is, concerning

The Romish Transubstantiation.
SECT. 6.
7 For proof hereof is produced the testimony of Doctor Apol. lit d.
Humfrey, who, among other corruptions taught by S. Gregory, numbreth
Transubstantiation. Which is by these Apologists (we think) impertinently
urged, especially knowing that Doctor Humfrey spoke not this from his own
judgment pitched upon any sentence of S. Gregory, but only out of a Romish
book, called the This is cited ^^ the margent of his Iesuitis. lo^o citato.
Legend: a story so utterly forlorn of all approbation by any Protestant,
that even their own learned Authors have not doubted to say, that Indigna
Diuis historia: Nihil foedius dici potest eo libro. Claud ^ spenc^ns Com. in
T^m. Digress. 1. Paris. 1561.
It is an history so unworthy to report the memory of Saints, that nothing
can be named more filthy then it is. That the matters reported therein
Insertis passim fabulis ac meris nugame^tis, etiam ipsam labefactarunt
veritatem. Royard. pras. ante Him. de Fest. Sanct.
do by fables and fooler^es overthrow the truth: so absurd, that Non ego ha^c
historiam excuso. quae Legenda Aurea nominatur; in illa enim miraculorum
monstra saepius quam vera miracula legas: quam scripsie homo ferrei oris,
plumbei cordis. Can^s locu theolog. lib. 11. cap. 6. page 337.
the Author thereof may seem to have a face of iron, and an heart of lead:
thereby noting him to have bin shameless and witless. Yet this place is the
only ground of these our Apologists objection concerning the testimony of
Doctor Humfrey, which proceeded not from his persuasion of the truth of that
Story, but from his supposition of the belief which the Romish professors
gave thereunto: which (notwithstanding diverse judicious Doctors among them
have rejected it, as filthy, foolish, fabulous) has been preached in their
Sermons, as being worthily graced with the title of Golden, and is known to be
generally embraced of their vulgar, as the true Acts and Monuments of holy
Saints.

8 Yet we shall not need to condemn the Apologists herein either of
subtlenesse, or of silliness, because by alleging a testimony for truth from
this ground of error, they are so much the more controllable by their own
judgment, as they themselves have promised to take the proof of their
Objections, Apolog praef. to the Parliament.
not from Apocryphal testimony of any pretended fabulous Legend, but from the
constant assertions of learned Protestants. But that we may retort the
authority of S. Gregory upon them, we prove first,

That S. Gregory was no patron of the Romish Mass in their transubstantiated
Sacrifice.
SECT. 7.
9 For their solemn Mass is not conceived of them without a propitiatory
corporal Sacrifice: this Sacrifice they admit not without a miraculous
Transubstantiation: now Conc. Trid Ses^. 13. cap 5. can 2.
Transubstantiation is (as their Romish Council has defined) a total change
of the substances of bread and wine into the very substances of the body and
blood of Christ: and by them held for a doctrine of faith. Which was so very a
non-ens in the doctrine of S. Gregory, that neither our most precise The
Centurists say, De coenae Domini materia recte docet ^regori us, Cent, 6. de
Gregorio.
Centurists could find cause to reprove this; nor yet Cardinal Cardinal
Bellarmine: Post annum Domini* ^o. Gregorius Papa, test Paulo Diacono in ejus
vita, ita coram populo locutus est, Praescius conditor etc. Bellar. de Sacram.
Eucha. lib. 3. cap. 20. Therefore was he glad to seek supply from the report
of Paulus Diaconus, who lived about two hundred years after the death of
Gregory.
Bellarmine, their own most subtle searcher of advantages, could allege
matter for proof hereof out of any writings of S. Gregory; being, indeed, a
plant of later times, suggested to the world as a matter of faith (as their
own learned Ante Concilium Lateranen^e, hoc dogma fidei non fuit. Scotus: vt
refert Bellar. lib. 3. de Euchar. cap. 23. This Council was Ann 1215. and S.
Gregory lived in t^^ end of the 600. year.
Schooleman auerreth) not until six hundred years after that S. Gregory
governed the Sea of Rome. If this be not sufficient for our discharge, we in
the next place prove,

That the doctrine of S. Gregory was diversely repugnant unto the now professed
corporal and transubstantiall Sacrifice of the Romish Mass.
SECT. 8.
10 The Sacrosancta Synodus Missas illas, in quibus solus sacerdos
sacramentaliter comm^nicat. non modo non damnat vt illicitas. sed etiam probat
atque commendat. Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. c. 6.
Romish Church professes a commendation of private Masses, wherein only the
priest does participate the Sacrament of the Eucharist, being (by the
confession of their own See hereafter out of Cassander.
Doctor) a custom not in the public and authorized practice of the Church,
till about a thousand years after the contrary institution of Christ.

11 Secondly, the now Romanists inuit the people unto their Mass, as unto a
Theater, to behold the Priests action in the celebration of the Eucharist, In
cujus persona (speaking of the Priest) totus populus quadam spirituali
sumptione sanguinem Christi bibere gaudenter debet credere. Ecchius de vtraque

membris, ita sacerdos pro omnibus Christianis spiritualiter. Beatus Vincent.
Sermon. Aestiu. de octava corp. Christ^. Antuerp. 1572.
only to eat spiritually by the mouth of the Priest. But the ancient Roman
Church (in the days of S. Gregory) ordained, that at the celebration of the
Sacrifice, the Cumque in eade Ecclei a Misarum so^ennia celebrarentur, atque ex
more Diaconus clamaret: Si qui^ non communicate det locum. Greg. Dialog. li. 2.
cap. 23. which be speaks not only of the Catec^iumeni, but also of professed
Nuns.
Deacon should say, Whosoever does not communicate, let him depart: which may
argue, that the difference between the now Roman Mass and that of S Gregory,
is no less then Communion and not Communion.

12 Thirdly, they believe their Mass to be Quaestio est de sac^ifi^io extern^
visibili ^e^e and pro^^ie dicto, facto man^sterio ^acerdotum etc. Bellar. l. 1.
de Missa cap. 5.
a proper visible sacrifice, that is, Alij (...) con^ecrat one Sacrifi^^ (...)

Al^no and (...), cap. 27. vbi sutra. ^. A^ij volunt.
a true sacrificing of Christ himself to his Father, though without bloodshed,
by the hands of the Priest: a Sacrifice of it self properly propitiatory for
the sins of so many, Non s^lus ^cus dist^ibuit virt^tem sacrific^j sed
S^cerd^^ quoque. (...) Sa^^rd it is e^^ determinate (...) Sac^ifi^^^ (...)
gentibus, praemium eddendum p^oh. (...) ^cclesiae sa^rifici^ (...). in ^an.
M^sse. ^ect. 26. (...). 542.
as the Priest by his momento extends it unto. But we, yielding the
all-sufficiencie of meritorious propitiatio^ unto Christ's bodily Sacrifice upon
the Altar of the Cross, do acknowledge that the ^fferture of Christ in the
Eucharist is not that corporal oblatio^, but, according to the teno^ of all
ancients, a memorial and commemoration thereof. Agreeable unto the writings
which our Adversaries attribute to S. Gregory, wherein it is said that Haec
namque singula^iter victims ab aetern^ intetitu a^mum sal^^at. Quae allam n^b^s
mortem vnig^ ni^^ per m^stetrum reparat. qui licet tesurgens a mortuis, ^am non

Christ is so offered in this Sacrifice, that although he die no more, yet by
it he is mystically sacrificca: expounding it thus; that this Sacrifice is an
imitation of his passion: adding, that Christus, qui a se re^urgens a m^^tuis,
iam non mo^itur, adhoc per hanc in suo mystetro pro nobis ^terum patitur: nam
(...) suae passionis ofte^^n us, t^ties nobis ad absol^tionem nostram passionem
illius reparan us. Greg. T^m. ^. Him. 3^. in ^uangel. (...) medium
Christ does suffer again for us in this mystery. Christ suffer again? this
word is more then our Romanists will maintain in the proper and literal
signification, and therefore must be contented to expound that Christ is in the
Eucharist, so said by S. Gregory to have been sacrificed, as he is said
therein to have suffered: which is not by any corporal passion, but by a
mystical representation. Which will appear to have been the universal
doctrine of the elder Church, when we come to consult thereof with ancient
Fathers.

13 F^u^thly, as for the corporal realitie of this Sacrifice, which our
adversaries defend upon an imagination of a miraculous Transubstantiation of
the Bread into the Body of Chirst, it does seem unto us to be sufficiently
confuted by the dispute which S. Gregory has against the Heretic Eutychius;
Qui cum e^d^m ^utychio in (...) vrbe positu^, hoc ^uangeli^ae (...) testimonium
[Luc. 14. Palpate and videte (...) ca^nem and os^a non habet, sicu^ me videtis
habete,] (...) ^ominus hoc lecit, vt dubi^ationem resu^^ection^^ (...) de
Di^cipuloru^ cordibus amoue^^t.
who objected, that the body of Christ after the resurrection was palpable for
the confirmation of the says of those present, to whom Christ said, [Handle
me, and see for a S^ir^t has not flesh and bones, as you see me have:] but yet
instantly after that he had been touched, it became a body more subtle, then
that it could be felt. Cu^^ quam ^ira est res valde quam astruis, vt inde nobis

resurrectione^ Dominus redijt in mortem. quod quis dicere vel stultus
piaesumat, nisi qui veram carnis ^ius resurrectionem denegat? Greg. tom. 1.
Moral. l. 14. c. 31.
S. Gregory answering that Heretic says, that this kind of change cannot
be affirmed of any, but of such as deny the truth of Christ his resurrection.
from this d^termination we may learn thus to argue, viz. that by the same
proof of sense may Christians judge bread to be bread after consecration, by
which the Disciples discerned Christ's flesh to be flesh after the resurrection,
^uc. 24. 39.
[Handle me and see (says Christ) a spirit has not flesh as you see me haue]
founding the verity of this Article upon the infallible testimony of two
senses. How much more forcibly may we conclude from the suffrages and evidence
of four senses, as smelling, seeing, handling, tasting, to prove that the
bread after consecration still remains bread? Which kind of reasoning from
natural sense in natural objects, being so used by Christ, must not (when it
is likewise urged by Protestants) be denied to be Christian.

14 A second reason we find in S. Gregory expounding the Angels speech unto
the Disciples, when they sought Christ in the Sepulcher, saying, [He is risen,
and is not here] whereupon Surtexit, non est hic] Non est hic dicitur per
praesentiam carnis, qui tamen nusquam deerat per praesentiam maiestatis. Greg.
(...). 21. Euang. Our adversaries may not reply, according to their common
Gloss, that it is meant in respect of a visible presence, because here the
natures are discerned by S. Gregory in their essential, and not according to
their accidental properties: for the essential property of Divinity is to
be every where present.
S. Gregory thus: It was said [he is not here] in respect of his bodily
presence, who according to his Divine majesty was euery-where present:
distinguishing two natures of Christ by their different and essential
properties, humane nature not to be possibly present in many places at once,
even as it is impossible but the divine nature should be present euery-where.
Which is more demonstratiue by the words of S. Matthew; Matt. 28. 6. And
whatsoever words our Adversaries object ^ut of Fathers, do carry rather the
sound then the sense.
He is not here, for he is risen: by which particle [(...), that is, for] a
note of consequence, we are taught, that if we shall thus argue [Christs humane
nature, cannot be here and there in one instant, and therefore being properly
in heaven, must not be fancied, in the same moment, to be corporally upon
earth] our conclusion must needs be found to be Angelical.

15 Finally, what was the faith of our Church of England about those times of
S. Gregory, may be observed by an ancient In the holy Font we see two things
in that one creature: after the true nature, the water is corruptible water,
and yet after spiritual mystery, it has hallowing might. So also if we be
behold the holy housell, it is bread, after bodily understanding, then we see
that it is a body corruptible and mutable; but if we acknowledge therein a
spiritual might, then understand we that life is therein, and it gives
immortality to them that eat it with belief. Much difference there is
between the invisible might of the holy housell* and the visible shape of the
proper nature. It is naturally corruptible bread, and corruptible wine, and it
is by the might of Gods word truly Christ's body and his blood; not so,
notwithstanding, bodily, but spiritually. Much difference is there between the
body that Christ suffered in, and the body that is hallowed to housell; the
body that Christ suffered in, was borne of the flesh of Marie with blood and
with bone, with sk^n, with sinews, in humane limbs, with a reasonable soul
living: and his spiritual body, which we call the housell, is gathered of
many corns, without blood and bone, without limme, without soul, and
therefore nothing therein is to be understood bodily, but all is spiritually to
be understood. I sermon (...). legend. in Fest. Paschatis. This is extant in

large, as being in it self a sufficient commentary and elucidation of the
mystical and sacramental participation of Christ's flesh. Only give us leave
to mention an other confessed difference, to wit, that notwithstanding Formam
Latinae Catholicae Ecclesiae ex Christi exemplo habemus, tantum his verbis

Cardinal Bellarmine says, that the form of the now Romish consecration,
used in their Church, is only in these words [Hoc est corpus meum:] yet an

the doctrine of Consecration used of the Apostles, was only by saying the
Lords prayer: which use of the Lords prayer, S. Gregory does approve for a
tradition Orationem Dominicam ideirco post precem dicimus, quia mos Apostolorum

(...) sity of good works in him that must be saved, yet they hold that these
kind of speeches [Goodworks are necessary to saluation] may hatch some
dangerous construction, as namely, to think them necessary in the act of our
Justification: and have therefore (yet in a pardonable jealousy, lest any thing
might detract from Christ's free bou^ty) too roughly and unworthily ce^sured
such like sayings of S. Gregory.

21 Notwithstanding in that, which is the now controversy between us and
Rome, man's Justification before Gods tribunal, and his meriting that kingdom
by his own works, the Centurists do truly testify, that S. Gregory stands
most resolutely with us for the magnifying of Grace against the dangerous
doctrine of Romish Merit, and then Justification by inherent righteousness:
where he (speaking even of the second Justification) teaches with all
Protestants, that Hominem gratis iustificari coram Deo, Gregorius saepe
pronunciat. ^^nt. 6 c. 10 page ^81.
We are justified before God freely by grace; that Or his humana iustitia (vt

man's righteousness is found to be unrighteousness, when it is strictly
ex^mined; that Ipsa iustitia nostra adexan e diuinae iustitiae deducta,
iniustitia est, and ^ordet in disti^^tione Iudicis, quae in aestimatione fulget

the Saints attain not eternal life for their merits, but that it is wholly
mercy; and though God does bestow heaven according to works, yet he does not
give it them for their works sake: In these last words diliuering to us that
necessatie distinction between rewarding of man, secundum opera, that is,
according to his works, and rewarding him, propter opera, that is, for the
worthiness of his works. Which distinction, when it is used by Protestants,
our adversaries do reject with a scoff, saying, M. Bishop in his (...).
O sharp and ouer-fine wit! does God render according to the works, and does
he not render for the works sake? By which taunt who sees not S. Gregory also
contemned by our adversaries, who (forsooth, the only witty Doctors) do
impute this unto their adversaries as a witless curiosity: which
notwithstanding they do upon an exigence, knowing that this distinction (if it
shall be allowed) may serve for a wedge, whereby the Most difficult reasons the
Romanists can possibly object in the question of merit, may be easily dissolved.

22 This was both that saving faith which our Conuerter S Gregori^ delivered to
the English Saxons, and the foundation and anchor of all his own hopes. Ad

I grow on to eternal life (says he) not by the merits of my works, but by
the pardon of my sins, presuming to obtain that by the only mercy of God,
which I do not hope for by mine own deserts. All which being spoken of the
state of man regenerate, and of his freedom from everlasting damnation, they
may be unto us a pregnant apology and satisfaction against all opposition of
our Romish Adversaries, in this high cause of Merit and Justification. The next
particulars do point at the state of man departed, whether unto a temporal
misery, (such are souls in Purgatory said to be in) or else unto eternal
felicity, as are the souls of the Saints. First concerning the place of the
less happy, we must try

The Romish doctrine of Purgatory.
SECT. 12.
23 Purgatory by Romish doctrine is described to be Greg. Valent. Ies. lib. de
^urg. and Bellar. li. 2. de Purg.
a fire of hell, adjoining to the place of the damned, wherein the souls of
the faithful departing in the guilt of venial sins ( Possit homo sancte
mori, and tamen habere debitu^ aliquod soluen^um, vel propter venialia pecca^a
nondu^ remissa in hac vita, vel propter satisfactionem pro mortalibus remistis
non plene expressam. Bellar. lib. 1. de Purg. c. 3.. Hinc. and. Ad quintum.
or, for the more full satisfaction of mortal sins which have been remitted)
are tormented, which is nothing differing from the punishment of the damned, in
respect of the extremity of pain, but only in respect of continuance of
time: Ecclesia celebrat anniuersaria pro defunctis, etiamsi constat eos ante
ducentos annos esse mortuos: quod certe non fieret, si Ecclesia ciederet no^
pumri animas vltra dictos annos. Bellar. l. 2. de Purg. cap. 9. and lib. 4. de

confession of this Purgatory (says Cardinal Bellarmine) is a part of
Catholic faith. Among many points often objected by our Apologists, we find
this Article, omitted in other places, and therefore may challenge of us a more
present and exact discourse, and first to examine,

Whether this Article of Romish faith have any foundation in Scriptures.

Roffensis lays down this proposition; The doctrine of Purgatory (says he)
being necessarily to be believed of all men, it is not credible but that it may
be proved by Scriptures. Granting in effect, that if it cannot be euinced by
Scripture, it may not be acknowledged as a doctrine necessarily to be believed
of all men. Now our Assumption, to wit, that it is not demonstrable by
Scriptures, we may draw from an induction of the principal places of
Canonical Scriptures, from whence our Adversaries have contended to prove

Doctors so exactly and particularly answered, that Protestants may well spare
all pains of any further confutation of their proofs. From these two
confessed premises it must follow, that this Article of their Purgatory,
standing so improbably upon Scriptures, may be suspected to be an exile from
the doctrine of faith.

25 Some others finding so slipperie footing in Scripture for defense hereof,
do next cast anchor upon presumption of unwritten traditions, hereditarily as
it were descending upon the Church by a lineall succession from ancient
Fathers. This gives us occasion further to inquire,

Whether the Romish Article of Purgatory were a matter of faith in the
profession of ancient Fathers: from the confession of our Adversaries.

Roffensis will witness in our behalf, saying, that whosoever shall read the
Greek Fathers, shall find none, or very rare mention of Purgatory: neither
yet did all the Latin Fathers (says he) at the first apprehend it. Confessing
further, that Vsque ad hunc ^^em Graecis non est creditum Purgatorium. Roffens.

It was not of a long time universally believed in the Church; but (two notable
arguments of nouelty) afterward by little and little, gained a general credit
in the Church. It will better appear what is their feeble hold, if we shall
but duly observe the false claim, which they make unto

The particular testimonies of ancient Fathers, which are unconscionably
wrested to prove that which they never meant: by the acknowledgements of our
learned Adversaries.

Cardinal, and our chief Adversary has propounded unto his scholars, viz.
That those testimonies of the Fathers which speak of the fire of the day of

Church; because the fire of the day of Judgment is a fire of examination and
trial: but the fire of Purgatory, which (says he) we dispute of, is a
purging and tormenting. fire. Whosoever shall take sure hold of this thread in
the search of the judgment of ancient Fathers concerning Purgatory, may most
easily wind himself out of the whole laby^inth of the perplexed and wrangling

their own Cardinal Bellarmine himself has already delivered) concern

disappoint our Adversaries of their pretended patronage of many Fathers, for

such kind of revelations, does give us cause to observe in him a deep plunge
into superstition. Our last answer shall be unfolded in this last examination,

Whether the Romanists do altogether consent unto the judgment of S. Gregory
in this question of Purgatory.
SECT. 18.
34 There is a story mentioned by Bid concerning an apparition of a ghost,
reporting (as Cardinal Narrat Beda lib. 5. h^st. ca. 13. Visionem probabilem,
cui ip^e fidem adhibere non dubitauit: fuit autem illi oftensum, cuidam animae,
quae ad corpus post a redijt, praeter infernum and purgatorium, and regnum
coelotu^, quoddam quasi pratu^ fuisse florent^^^mum, lucidi^ssimu^, odoratum,
amoenu^, in quo degebant animae. quae nihil patiebantur, sed tamen ibi
ma^ebant, quia nondum idone^ erant vision^ be^tae. Cui Reuelation^ multas alias

31. and Greg. l. 4. Dial. ca. 36. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Purgat. cap. 7.. Quantum.
Bellarmine witnesses) that he discovered an infernal place, wherein there
dwelt souls, which suffered no pain, etc. Like stories unto this are
published by Dionysius Carthusianus, and S. Gregory. All of them giving credit
unto fancies in these kinds. Whereupon their Jesuits have passed their
censure; first Cardinal Non est improbabile talem aliquem locum repe^iri; etsi
enim ibi nulla sit poena sensus, est tamen poena damni: poena autem non
conuenit nisi animae, quae nondum plene purgata est: itaque erit locus ille
mitissimum Purgatorium, and carcer quasi senatorius atque honoratus. Bellar.
ibid.. Videtur.
Bellarmine: It is not improbable (says he) but that there is some such
pleasant and honorable prison: but their Jesuit Hae reuelationes Bedae and
Carthusiani, nisi metaphoram aliquam contineant, mihi non faciunt fidem. Suarez
Ies. tom. 4. in Thom. disp. 46.. 4. number. 9. and. 1. number. 12. and 13.
Suares; Except these revelations of Beda and Carthusian, (says he) be
metaphorically interpreted, I cannot believe them. Now it is This he spea^eth
of the story of Bid and Carthusianus: whereunto the Dialogue of S. Gregory
(says Bellarmine) is consonant. Nay whosoever shall read that Dialogue, he
shall perceive that Bellarmine did more honor the judgment of S. Gregory in
not repeating it, then he could dishonor him in not believing it.
certain that these Revelations are by the above named Authors as historically
related, as they are wished by this Jesuit to be metaphorically interpreted:
wherein we may perceive a new doctrine concerning the residence of souls,
discovered by the intelligence of walking ghosts, whereunto Bid, Carthusian,
and S. Gregory yield a full assent; which notwithstanding their Cardinal
Bellarmine dare believe but only in a probability: their Jesuit dare not
believe them at all in the literal sense.

35 What our Apologists would resolve upon this case, may be pertinently
demanded; for if they say that unto S. Gregory, as unto the successor of S.
Peter, were the keys of all the prisons of Purgatory committed, and therefore
his judgment in the case of souls must be esteemed infallible: how shall they
excuse these their own Doctors, who have either not fully believed, or else
fully not believed such conceits: but if they shall justify these their
Authors, then may they not envy in Protestants the like liberty of dissenting
from the opinion of S. Gregory.

36 Lastly, the principal cause why the Romanists have set up their furnace of
Purgatory fire, and caused it to burn as furiously as hell ( Poena illa, quae
luenda restat post culpae remissionem, est illa ipsa poena sensus quam peccator
pati debuisset in gehenna, rem^t^ solum aeternitate. Bellarm. lib. 4. de
Poenit. cap. 1.. Quod si.
except only that it is not eternal) for the tormenting of the servants of
God for Catholica sententia est, Purgatorium esse pro ijs tantum, qui cum
venialibus culpis moriuntur, and pro ijs, qui cum reatu poenae culpis tam
remissis. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Purgat. cap. 1. in fine. Vel propter
satisfactionem pro mortalibus remissis non plene expletam. Ibid. lib. 1. cap.
3.. Hine.
venial sin, is the point which they lay thus for the ground of all this
doctrine, to wit, Catholici summo consensu docent, post remissam culpam saepe
manner reatum poenae temporalis. Bellarm. lib. 4. de Poenit. cap. 2.
God forgiving the guilt of sin, does notwithstanding inflict upon his
servants a temporal torment. This Prima no st^ controu^rsia est, an remis^ a
cul^a reman^ at (...) poenae temporalis. Conuen unt Aduersarij de r^atu poenae

con^^n^u Purg^tori^m and ^uss^agia, atque indulgenuas pro de^unctis n^gi^t
Bellar. ibid. (...).
all Protestants condemn as derogatory unto Gods justice: and not agreeable
unto the doctrine of S. Gregory, who never feined the sin pardonable in any
party who was punished. Ioyn^ly obseruable is the only matter of Purgatory,
which S. Gregory believed, as Sed pro qui^u^dam leuibus culpis ante iudi^tum
ignis Purgatorius credendus est: sed tamen, hoc, vt dixi, de paruis minimisque
peccatis fieri posse credendu^ est, sicut est ociosus sermo. immoderatus risus.
Greg. Dial. lib. 4. c. ^9.
light sins, idle speech, immoderate laughter: whereof he says, [sed tamen
hoc de paruis:] plainly signifying, that except it were for such light saults,
no infernal Purgatory were to be believed, and therefore conceived there of as
of a lighter punishment. But the now Romish faith teaches the cause of
Purgatory scorch to be Catholica sent^ntia est, Purgatorium esse pro ij^
tantum, qui cum veta^libus culpis not^^ntur, and pro ijs qui cum reatu ^oenae,
culpis tam rem^ssis ^ib. 2. de Purg. cap. 1. fine. Propter satisfactionem pro

for a satisfaction of the punishment of mortal, and ventall sins also. Among
venial sins, they reckon up Non been sanctificare Sabbatum. Tolet. Ies.
Instruct. Sacerd. c. 25.
no well keeping of the Sabbath: Conuitium aliquod ex tra, ^nam cum

lib. 3. cap. 7.
scurrilous speaking. Which sins S. Gregory never did, nor any regenerate
soul can possibly account in their own nature, venial. This argues that S.
Gregory held but half of their faith. We forbear to mention another sin,
which they weigh in venial weights (not to be once named amongst Christians,
and the heathen themselves do condemn it) which they call See hereafter, but
under a (...), in the question of single life of the Clergy.
venial. As if they did profess, that Purgatory torment were not to be
believed, except these kind of sins (which S. Gregory excluded from thence)
were fuel for that flame.

37 All these premises rightly pondered, as namely, how for proof of this
doctrine both divine Scriptures have been tortured, and the testimonies of
Fathers perverted, amongst whom this Romish doctrine obtained neither a
generality of profession, nor certainty of faith; how their last, yea and
chiefest hold is Revelations (the great motive unto S. Gregory his Credo) from
the spirits of the dead, which by ancient Fathers have been judged, sometimes
damnable, always dangerous, as the experience of diverse Romanists has also
confirmed, some of them judging S. Gregory too credulous of such fancies, and
forbidding us to follow him in such his reproouable speculations; and lastly,
he himself challenging us to accord unto that fundamental hold of the
Primitive faith, which he professed, saying that See hereafter, Chap. 5.. 1.
lit. f.
No doctrine may be thought necessary to be believed, but that which is
grounded upon Scripture; we may rightly disclaim their Purgatory, and so pass
to such point, which our Adversaries make to be consequents thereof, which are

SECT. 19.
38 These being (by the now Romish doctrine) the imagined sparks of their fire
of Purgatory, now already confuted, may without further trial be thought to
vanish together with their cause: yet lest our Reader may further scrupulize
and doubt, we willingly tender unto him a satisfaction also in this point.

Humfrey does not prove (which is the Apologists pretense) that S. Gregory

volumes of S. Gregory, that Cardinal S^^^tum Gregorium Indulgentias in diebus

In the days of ancient Fathers (says their Jesuit) there was a more strict
discipline used in the Church, when there was not so great need of Indulgences;
but after that the heat of penance did decrease, the use of them grew frequent
(to wit) after the days of Lombard and Gratian, which was about 1200. years
after Christ. This may satisfy for the discovery of the novelty of these
Pardons. It will be no lost labor to display likewise

Yet (says he) Mayor and Durand two ancient Divines did doubt of the truth of

otherwise. Be this granted, yet we hence may perce^^e that in their time the
judgment of the Church of Rome concerning this spiritual treasury, did stand
only upon peradventure. So shallow and rotten this foundation of their

41 Again, an Indulgence or pardon Ecclesiastical, which is a relaxation of
punishment imposed upon public offenders, the Fathers practiced, and
Protestants do approve: but such a virtue hereof, which may satisfactorily
acquit men before God, they utterly renounce. This, we wish, may be determined

Some Catholics (says Cardinal Bellarmine) deny, that by Indulgences we
have freedom from punishment in respect of God, but yet I will prove (says
he) that they are deceived. This is a fundamental point in the question of
Romish Indulgences: and yet what security is there in this doctrine, wherein
their learned Doctors might be thus deceived?

42 Next, because Indulgence is in their doctrine a remission of some acts of
Penance, and cannot be applied without just cause, we would know whether that

new, so think we it to be sacrilegious; because hereby is mingled (in the
power of satisfaction) the polluted blood and suffering of men with the
immaculate blood of the Lamb Jesus Christ. A doctrine so harsh and hateful in
the ears of true Christians, that their own disciples, even the Non defuerunt

Divines of Louane, and others (as Cardinal Bellarmine witnesses of them)
have certainly defended, that the sufferings of Saints cannot be true
satisfactions, but that our punishments are remitted only by the personal
satisfactions of Christ. But we must consult with S. Gregory for the
confutation of their It is verbal and deceitful, by reason of a false Index,

verbal objection. Ipsa Rede^ptoris nostri passio long a nostra passione
disiuncta est; quoniam ipse sine culpa pertulit, quod nos cum culpa toleramus.
Greg. in Euang. h^mil. 22. agreeable to that of S. Augustine.
He taught, that the suffering of our Redeemer is herein distinguished from the
sufferings of all others, because Christ suffered without sin, and all men
suffer with sin. Which one sentence (being agreeable unto S. Augustine,
saying, that Christus suscipiendo poenam, and non suscipiendo culpam, and
culpam deleuit and poenam. Ser. 13. de verbis Dom. T^m. 4. page 1846.
Christ by sustaining our punishment without our guilt, did cancel both our
guilt and punishment,) is able alone to overthrow the whole frame of Indulgence
toward the dead by the satisfactions of the living; because the Romish
foundation of this doctrine is only to think, that Indulgentia est relaxatio
poenae temporalis post remissam culpam debitae. Gregor. Valent. Ieso
God remitteth the guilt of such as are in Purgatory, and yet exacteth of them
a temporal punishment. Thus much concerning one man's satisfaction in behalf
of others.

48 But lest our obiectors may by the word Satisfaction, intend also that
Satisfaction which they will have man after confession to perform for
himself, not unto man (which all Christians do hold to be necessary) but unto
God: we are therefore again to advise with S. Gregory, who indeed requires
that after man has confessed his sins, he should Tertia species, id est,
vindicta, quasi medicina necessaria est, vt Apostema reatus quod conuersione
compungitur, confitendo purgetur, afflictionisque medicina sanetur: tum namque
been conuersum peccatorem cernimus, dum digna afflictionis austeritate delere
nititur, quod loquendo confitetur. Greg. l. 6 in 15. cap. 1. Reg. cap. 24. 282.
take revenge of himself by penitential exercises: comparing the sinful
condition of man to an impostume, in the cure whereof contrition and sorrow is
the first pricking and lancing of the sore; confession of it is, as it were,
the venting of the putrified corruption, and cleansing of the wounds; and
lastly our reuenges taken upon our selves, and voluntary satisfactions, our
weeping, fasting, prayers, alms, are the means not only of entreating
pardon, but of eating out the dead flesh, and the final and perfect healing of
the impostume, that it break forth no more. All which do confirm not any
legal, but only a medicinal satisfaction, whereby the sinner is better
disposed, and by repentance is made more capable of grace, but no meritorious
cause thereof. Contrariwise their Cardinal Possumus aliquo modo ex proptijs
and ad aequalitatem, ac per hoc just and ex co^digno satisfacere. Bellar. lib
4. de Poenit. cap. 7. Illud tamen.
Bellarmine thus defines: In some sort (says he) our own act, whereby we may
after satisfy according to the measure of equality, by the merit of
condignitie. Which is a doctrine far degenerate from the ancient faith of S.
Gregory, Iustus Aduocatus noster iustos nos defendet in iudicio, quia
nosmetipsos and cognoscimus, and accusamus iniustos. Non ergo in fletibus, non
in actibus nostris, sed in Aduocati nostri allegatione confidamus. Greg. in

who professed that, just men are defended by our just Advocate Christ Jesus,
because they accuse themselves, and confess that they are unjust, and
therefore are to have no confidence in their own tears or acts, but in the
intercession of Christ. To conclude therefore, that although the acts of
repentance and mortification may be called Satisfactions, by way of complacency
and acceptance by the grace and favor of God, who delights in such incense,
the fruits of repentance: yet are they so far from the nature and virtue of
condign merit, and proper satisfaction, that not only their own See before

imperfect, and polluted with sin; yea and that the virtue of holy men is but
vice, so that if they be weighed in the balance of Gods strict justice, they
are unable to stand in his terrible presence. As yet therefore in these
particulars of Indulgences and Satisfaction, we have S. Gregory an adversary
unto the now Romish faith. We leave the state of those Saints, whom our
Adversaries will suppose to be in hellish torments, and come to behold the state
of such Saints, whom we hope to be inhabitants in heaven: and answer unto the
objection concerning

The now Romish doctrine of Invocation of the Saints in heaven.
SECT. 24.
49 The Patriarks of the old Testament, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were the
beloved of God, and in the covenant of Grace; yet notwithstanding, there is not
read (says Cardinal Non legitur solitum esse ante Christi aduentum Sanctos
inuocar^. Bellar. lib. 1. de Eccles. triumph. cap. 6.
Bellarmine) that before the coming of Christ there was any custom of
inuocating or calling upon those Saints. And again, another learned Quod

Jesuit, There is not in all the book of God (meaning the old Testament) an
example of any one, who ever directly prayed unto any Saint for help by their
prayers. But the people of God in the old Testament (notwithstanding there were
then an holy communion between the dead and the living, as diverse members of
one body) did for many thousand years together, without mediation of Saints
departed, only in the faith of our The La^ be slain from the beginning. Apoc.
13. verse. 8.
Messiah Jesus, present their petitions unto God, and found acceptance.

50 Again, sometime after the ascension of our Savior into heaven, it was not
learned or practiced of the first conuerts unto the faith of Christianity: for
Duium esset id ludaei^ praecipere, and occasio daretur Gentibus putandi sibi
exhibitos multos deos pro multitudine deorum, quos relinquebant. Quantum ad
verbo and ore traditam doctrinam, non est dubium, quin Ecclesijs Apostoli eam
tradiderint. Salmeron Ies. in 1. Tim. 2. disp. 8.. Postremo.
it had been then (says their Jesuit) offensive unto the Jews, and an
occasion of error unto the converted Gentiles. And yet even at that time many
souls of blessed Saints (by their own doctrine) did enter with Christ the
king of glory, into those everlasting doors of blessedness. We need not
therefore be greatly moved with the contrary doctrine of S. Gregory, whom
their own Doctors have noted to have been too much addicted unto
superstitions. Nevertheless as we find in him very rarely any prayer unto
Saints, so unto the Virgin Marie not any one; which we may conjecture he would
not have pretermitted, if he had constantly believed, the bessed Virgin to be
(according to the now Roman faith) the Constituta est B. Virgo super omnem
creaturam, and quicunq^e lesu curuat genu, matri quoque pronus supplicat, and
filij gloriam cum matre non tam commune^ iudico quam candem: Which are the
words of Arnoldus Carnot. tract. de laudib. Virg. and thus commended by Viega.

sect. 2. number. 3. ^^^gdum 1602.
Prince of all creatures, to whom every one must make supplication, whosoever
bends his knee unto Christ, with whom the glory is common if not the same.
Therefore we yield rather unto S. Gregory, where he lays for an immovable
ground of faith the sufficiency of Scripture, saying that nothing is to be
admitted for necessary doctrine, which is not founded upon Scripture. And thus
by S. Gregory his ancient doctrine we are freed from those later inventions:
whereof we are to See hereafter, in the question of Invocation, where it is
objected out of the Fathers.
speak more at large, where it is more instantly urged against us. The next
particulars are touching external worship; and the question is

Whether S. Gregory taught the now Romish doctrine of the worshipping of
Images and Relics.
SECT. 25.
51 The last point objected out of Osiander, is the worshipping of Images, who
was moved (as it may seem) to censure S. Gregory herein, by the reprehension
which S. Gregory used against Serenus Bishop of Massilia, for breaking down
the pictures which he saw abused by Idolatry. Perlatum est ad nos, quod
inconsiderato zelo succensus, Sanctoru^ imagines sub hac quasi excusatione, ne
adorari debuislent, confregeris. Et quidem q^ia cas adotari ^^tui^^es, omnino
lauda^^mu^, fregisse vero reprehendi^^is: aliud est enim picturam ador^re,
aliud per picturae historiam quid sit adorandum addiscere: nam quod legentibus
Scriptura, hoc idiotis praestat pictura cernentibus Greg. lib. (...). 9.
Indi^t. ^.
For though you did well (says S. Gregory unto that Bishop) in forbidding the
adoration of them: yet it was inconsiderate Zeal in you to break down those
historical pictures, which are set up only for the instruction of the
ignorant, and not for adoration. So that we see De his pictutis quae fuctir
men's and sententia Romanae ^cclesiae adhucaetate Gregorij, satis ex eius
scriptis manifestum est, videlicet ideo haben picturas, non quidem vt colantur
and adorentur, sed vt imperitipicturis inspiciendis haud aliter ac literis
legendis rerum gestarum admonerentur, and ad pietatem incitarentur. Cassander.
lib. Consult. Art. 21. de cu^tu Imag.. De Imaginibus. page 155. Coloniae 15^7.
the Church of Rome in the days of S. Gregory (as their learned Cassander
witnesses, and S. Gregory his own See above, the letter 2. And again, Si
quis facere Imagines voluerit, minime prohibe, adorare vero Imagines omnibus
modis deuit^. Sed hoc solicit admoneas, vt ex visione rei gestae ardorem
compunctioni^ percipiant, and in adoratione solius Trimtatis humiliter
prosternatur. Id^m ibid. Aliud est picturam adorare, aliud per picturae
historiam quid sit adorandum addiscere. Greg. lib. 9. epist. cap. 9.
writings do show) did allow of such pictures as historical monuments, whereby
the unlearned might be put in remembrance of things done, but in no case
suffered to worship them. Which how little it differs from the doctrine of
Protestants, their own learned Opinio Caluim est, imagines non esse
simpliciter prohibitas, sed tantum lustoricum vsum adni^^tit. B^llar. lib. 2.
de ^ccles. Triumph. cap. 8. and 10.
Cardinal may witness, saying even of Master Calvin, that he does not simply
condemn the having of Images, but admits of them only for an historical
use: that is, to this end, thereby to represent the acts of Christ, and holy
Saints, and not to worship them.

52 Nevertheless, that his not suffering Images to be broken, when there was
so public and general Idolatry committed with them, seemed unto our *
Osiander, although not a direct, yet an occasionable approouing of Idolatry, or
rather a cloaking thereof: for in himself he did both account that worship
Idolatry, as has appeared, and utterly abhorred the abomination thereof.
Howbeit, it had been requisite, that he had kept that rule, which his successor
Pope Si nonnulli ex praedecesso^ibus nostris fecerunt aliqua, quae illo tempore
potuerunt esse sine culpa, and postea vertuntur in errorem and superstitionem,
sine tarditate aliqua, and cum magna authoritate a posteris destruantur.

Stephen prescribed in such like cases of humane inventions, to wit, If our
ancestors (says he) have done any thing which is afterward turned into
superstition, it is to be abolished without delay. Which was also the only
remedy which the ancient Council of Concilium Elibertinum imagines in templis

remains that we show

How that S. Gregory, concerning the use of Images, gain said the now Romish
doctrine and practice; by the confession of our learned Adversaries.

53 Their Jesuit Constans est Theologorum sententia, imaginem eodem cultu and
honor coli, quo colitur id, cuius est imago. Azor. Ies. Institut. Moral. l. 9.
c. 6.. Tota haec.
Azorius, reporting the judgment of their former Schoolmen, says, that it
was their constant opinion, that Images must be worship ped with the same
honor, which is due unto the person whose Image it is: which doctrine of their
ancient School they have of late qualified with the term of Bellarm. lib. 2.

solum per accider^s and improprie, sed etiam perse and proprie, ita vt iplae
terminent venerationem vt in se con side^antur, and non solum vt vicem gerunt

Improperly, but in such subtle sort, that seeing their learned are scarce able
to unfold this mystery, their people must needs be deeply plunged in
idolatrous conceits. For which cause diverse of their own Doctors have
complained, Sunt been multi rudiores, qui imagines colunt, non vt signa, sed
perinde quasi ipsae sensum habeant, magisque eis fidunt, quam Christo. Polydor.
Virgil. Invent. lib. 6. cap. 13.
that very many of the ruder sort do worship Images idolatrously. Manifestius
hoc est, quam vt ^ultis verbis explicari possit. Cassander Consult. Art. 21.
A matter more notorious (says another) then that it can be denied. Dici non
potest quanta superstitio, ne dicam, Idololatria pencs rudem and indoctam
plebem alatur in imaginibus, conniuentibus ad ista sacerdotibus, hinc non
pa^uum lucri quaestum percipi^ntibus. Agrippa de Vanit. scient. cap. 57. ^or
how can it otherwise be, when (as it is already said by a Jesuit) Constans est
Theologorum sententia, imaginem eodem honor and cultu honorari, quo colitur id
cuius est imago. Et idem vid^^^r significare Concilium Tridentinum. Azorius
Ies. Instit. Mor. lib. 9. cap. 6.. Tota haec.
And so great is the Idolatry (says a third) and so still nourished by
Images, as is wonderful. But they will say, that this was the abuse of Images:
it is true: and therefore should they reform it according unto the wisdom of
ancient Fathers, of whom we read, that Imaginum cultum non modo nostrae
Religionis expertes, sed (test Hieronymo) omnes fere veteres sancti Patres
damnabant ob metum Idololatriae, qua nullum execrabilius scelus esse potest.
Polydor. Virgil. lib. 6. Invent. cap. 13.
they of all vices condemned all worship of Images, even for fear of
Idolatry, the most execrable vice of all. From which (if nothing else) the
very jealousy of God should deter us, which cannot permit his holy ones so
much as to incline unto that worship whereby they may become idolatrous, that
is, Idololatria est stuprum foedissimum, and flagitiorum ^ons. A^osta Ies. de
Indorum salute. page 469. and 468.
most filthy and adulterous. As for the judgment of S. Gregory, we find it
further thus confessed, that Certum est Gregoruim imagines probasse, non
cultum. Agrippa de Vanit. cap. 70.
certainly he allowed not the worship of Images. The next question has
affinity with this, viz.

The now Romish use of Relics.
SECT. 27.
54 The translation of Relics, and the honorable remoouing the bones (...)

was subject to the judicial authority of S. Gregory: and hereupon our
Adversaries conclude him to be too shameless who shall deny the Popes
supremacy. Whereas the word Bizancenus (or as some read it Bizacenus) is
taken from Bizatium a Province in Affricke, and not Bizantium the City of
Constantinople: as it is well observed in the edition of their own Canon law,
set forth not long since by Pope Gregory 13. where the allowed In I pistola

Gloss says thus; Anselme and Gratian were deceived by the title of that
Epistle of S. Gregory, because there Bizancenus signifies not the Patriarch
of Constantinople, but the Primate of Africa. A truth acknowledged also by
their Cardinal Baronius anno Christi. 599. number. 4.

our Authors have taken the reason of their exceptions.

S. Gregorte affirms (says Cardinal Bellarmine) that the Church of
Constantinople is subject unto the Bishop of Rome, as Eusebius the Bishop of

Epistle pass for curra^t, they must first prove, that there was any Bishop of

Bishoprics of Syracusa and Thessaly are said to have been pulled from Rome,
and made subject unto the Patriarch of Constantinople. Therefore we rather
suspect some nimble scribes, and zealous of the prerogative of the Roman Sea,
to have inserted such terms of pre-eminence into these other Epistles, then
that we will judge S. Gregory by the blindness of ambition to have contradicted
himself. For it will appear, i Bellarm. lib. 2. de Romans P^nt. cap. 14.. Item.

61 Neither yet is it consonant which their two Cardinals do oppose hereunto,

many Popes more ancient then S. Gregory, have been named Bishops of the
Catholic (that is, universal) Church: adding, It is all one to be called
universal Bishop of the Church, and to be called Bishop of the universal
Church. This, we say, is false, and is therefore expressly controlled by their
own Doctors, who auerre that these two, Differunt vniu^^salis Episcopus, and

universal Bishop of the Church, and Bishop of the universal Church are
different. And it stands with good sense, that the universal Bishop of the
Church, must necessarily betoken an absolute Monarchical jurisdiction of some
one over all other Bishops of the Church: but the Bishop of the Catholic or
universal Church, is no more then to signify the care and study any Bishop
has for the universal good of the Church. In which respect S. Paul said of
himself: 2. Cor. 11. 28.

Baronius his consequent, saying, that these terms, Episcopus Catholicae

joined with the word Bishop, must betoken an universal Bishop of the Church.
Which argument can have no better coherence, then when This is the ordinary
title wherewith all Romanists do instile the King of Spain.
they intituling the King of Spain to be the most Catholic King, or King of
the Catholic Church, they would conclude him to be the universal King, and to
have a sovereignty over all other Kings in the Church.

62 Again, our opinion concerning the moderation of S. Gregory his judgment,
may be confirmed by the feebleness of the answer of out opposite and highly
advanced Dico, quamuis ipsi Grego^^o hic titulus conueniret, eo tamen ipse vti
noluit, vt facilius comprimeret Episcopi Constantinopolitam superbiam. ^t sic
manner Caluini agumentum solutum. Bellar. lib. 2. de Romans Pont. cap. 31.
Adversary, saying, that therefore S. Gregory would not acknowledge the name
of universal Bishop, which otherwise he knew to belong unto him, for this end,
that by denying his due title, he might more easily repress the insolency of
John Bishop of Constantinople, who wrongfully challenged the same title unto
himself. Which answer, we judge to be unworthy either the learning of the
Author, or the wisdom of any judicious Reader; except a man would imagine,
that any King can think it a policy to renounce his own just title of
sovereignty (specially being intended to be given by Christ himself) only
thereby to disable the claim of some rebel, who falsely and presumptuously
usurps the same. So also is it utterly contrary to the disposition of S.
Humilitatem tene ^mus in mente, and tamen ordinis nostri dignitatem seruemus in
honor. Greg. li. 4. ep 36.
Gregory himself, who professed so far to preserve humility, as never to
prejudice the right of his own Sea and dignity: and yet has avouched of all
the Bishops of the Sea of Rome before him, against the usurper of that title
(John the Patriark^ of Constantinople) saying, Quid tu Christo vniuersalis

(...) conaris Vniuersalis appe^latione supponere^ Greg lib 4. ep. 38. non

None of my Predecessors ever consented to use it. Now then S. Gregory
renouncing the title of universal Bishop, must be thought to have equally
disclaimed the universal jurisdiction it self, the only thing properly
signified thereby, foreseeing the miserable decaies of his former holds.

63 But our adversaries have built a new fort of defense, against (as they
think) all power of assault, by telling us that the term universal, was
refused by S. Gregory only in that sense, wherein John the Patrtarke of
Constantinople did abuse it, signifying such an hierarchy and pre-eminence
Vnus sen us est huiu^ tituli, vt ille qui dicit^: vniuersalis ^pi^copus omniam
v^bium Christi marum, ita vt caeteri non sint Episcopi, sed vicarij tantum
illius, and hoc modo est profanum vocabulum, vt loquitur Gregorius, etc.
Bellarm. l^^. 2. de R^m. Pont. cap. 31. Re^pondeo duobus. So also Costerus Ies.
See above in the margent, at the letter, d.
of universal Bishop of al Cities, as that all other Bishops should not be
Bishops but only vicars unto him: and in this sense (says he) did S. Gregory
renounce it, and pronounce it a profane and sacrilegious title. But this
conceit fights against all light of history, which shows, that all the
Greek Bishops consented unto the universal title of John their Patriark; which
they would not have done to have made themselves only vicars, and as it were
Vassals unto one Greek B. of Const^ntinople. It is likewise contrary to the
judicious acknowledgement of their own learned historians, who say of the Sea
of Rome, that Boniface the third (who, next but one, succeeded S. Gregory) did
obtain of Phocas the Emperor (but not without much ado) that the Sea of Rome
should be called the head of all Churches, viz. the very SAME PLACE of
pre-eminence, which John the Patriarch of Constantine (in the days of S.
Gregory) challenged to himself. Finally, it is repugnant unto the plain
confession of our G^aeci Episcopi sedem Constantinopo itanam, non solum ad
patriarchatum euehere, and edi Alexandrinae, and Antiochenae praeferre, sed
etiam aequare Romanae, and vniuersale^ face^e voluerunt. Bellar. lib. 2. de

it universal (but only) to equal it with the Sea of Rome. So that if that
sense which Cardinal Bellarmine feined, be admitted, Pope Boniface the third,
and all the successors of S. Gregory, retaining the same title in the same or
rather a worse sense, are by the judgment of S. Gregory made conuincible of
profane, sacrilegious, and Antichristian impiety. But if the same sense cannot
consist, then are our Adversaries left forlorn of all strength of resistance;
because to conceive, that S. Gregory did only in humility refuse that title
of universal Bishop, which he himself (as has been showed) did abhor in
another, and renounce as never due either unto his predecessors, or himself,
and in detestation thereof called it impious and blasphemous; to think (as our
Adversaries have answered) that he challenged and exercised the universal
authority, power, and jurisdiction, does much derogate from the admirable
worthiness and sanctity of S. Gregory: because hereby they must note him (a
thing very remarkable) to have been no sincere Pastor, but a profane and subtle
politician, not unlike unto the first Caesar, who in history is noted to have
disclaimed the title of a King, that thereby he might more plausibly and
popularly execute all monarchical and kingly power and authority.

64 We might further add another testimony of S. Gregory, in whom we find
that jurisdiction which he claimed, to be proportioned by the Imperial
Constitutions of Justinian, denying any right of appeal unto the Bishop of
Rome in any diocese of other Bishops, over which there was set any Patriarch:
which Constitution S. De persona Stephani hoc attendendum est, quia nec inuitus

Gregory does acknowledge and allow. Whosoever therefore will respect either
the consonancy of story, or the synceritie of S. Gregory, must conclude with
their own learned Cardinal Cusaenus, who (in his book written of the Concord
of the Church) confesses without all ambages or windings, that Dicit Gregorius
epist. 22. Nullum Episcopum ita principatum gerere, vt omnia membra Ecclesiae

by the doctrine of S. Gregory, no Bishop, except he will be like unto Lucifer
in presumption, may bear such rule, as to make all other Bishops subject unto
him. Let us yet further see whether this may not be a wonder unto us, that S.
Gregory, who was the first Pope that Praenotare vero epistolas suas Greg. ita

Adversaries.

Yet did he admonish the Emperor (says he) to yield honor and reverence unto
Priests, which is a duty belonging unto a Superior; collecting from this word
Reverence, a note of pre-eminence of Ecclesiastical persons above the
Emperor. Which Gloss cannot proceed from any not forgetful of the language
of common courtesy: for if from the act of doing a man honor, may be
concluded a duty of subjection, it must follow from the same term used both
in Scripture, and in the ingraffed law of morality, that Let husbands give
honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel 1. Pet. 3. 7.

ingenuous spirits, Gregorius magnus agnoscebat Imperatoribus concessum esse ius

Nevertheless we desirously entreat their patience, to suffer us to discuss
this question only from the judgments of their own Doctors, and then
accordingly to censure, how far either S. Gregory has dissented from the
direction of the primitive truth, or they themselves from S. Gregory: our
examination touches only two points, to wit, the Antiquity and Equity of
their present claim.

The point of Antiquity, of constrained single life of the Clergy.

Their reason is (if yet there can be any reason in so ugly and prodigious a
doctrine,) because it is better (say they) that a Priest should play the
whooremonger, and keep a concubine, then after his vow of continency to be
coupled in wedlock. Although the repetition of this opinion may be, in the
ears of any chaste Reader, a sufficient confutation thereof: yet will we do our
Adversaries the right of dispute, as first to consult with antiquity, from the
confessed testimonies of Fathers. S. Cyprianus lib. 1. epist. 11. ad Pomponium,
ita scribit, -- de quibusdam virginibus, quae post^a quam se Deo dicauerunt,
cum malcul^s cubare repertae fuetant: [Quod^i le ex fide Christo dicauerunt,

Cyprian (speaking of virgins votaries, and overtaken with folly) says
insolubly, that it is better for such to marie, then to fall into the fire of
lust. Their Cardinal Hunc locum Aduerlarij obiecerunt: -- and P^trus Martyr

Bellarmine framed an answer unto this place of S. Cyprian, but such a
distorted one, as, by the judgment of their own Quodsi ex fide le Christo

same Virgins, which are said, Dedicasse se Deo, to be understood in the next
clause, where it is said, Melius est vt nubant. As for that, the difference of
Vow, to say it is simple, it cannot crosseour purpose, because, Votum simplex
tantum obligat apud Deum, quant un solenne. (A ^dit.) non au^em quantum ad
Ecclesiam. Maldon. Ies Sum q. 15. art. 17. Whether the vow be simple or
sol^mne, is all one before God: and why not therefore before the Church, when
as public notice is ta^en there^f as was in this case of these virgins, whom
Cyprian wills to be searched for their fault, presuming they had been
conse^rated to God in their inte^tions*
Pammelius, is flatly repugnant unto the words and scope of S. Cyprian.

74 Tertullian likewise speaking of professed windows, who had broken their
first faith, says that Tertul ^n lib de Monogamia, in illud 1. Tim. 5. Volo

the Apostle will have such to marry. Here again their Cardinal Respondeo,

thin^^ the faith is but one: for their Concu^^nari^ns, after that by
filthiness they break their faith, do not renew their vow, but repa^re and
confirm it. And their own
Bellarmine would dim our light, but their own Renatus de la Bar does ma^e

dissolved: contrary to the Romish practice in this land after the death of
King Edward the sixth, when it was decreed, that Contraque dece^nitur, vt

the contract of marriage is firm and inviolable, but not (say they) after a

for if (as Maldonat^ has said) a vow is a religious promise made unto God, and
in respect of God there is no difference between the simple and solemn; why
should the Church make a difference of them in such particular cases, wherein
the simple vow of the party is made known to the Church? Where the cause is
the same in respect of God, doubtless the judgment of the Church in behalf
of God should be the same. By this it is discernable, that their absolute
restraint in the solemn vow, is not of God, or else could not the reuocation
of their simple vow be thought inviolable.

Others adding (which is the universal consent of their Canonists) that
matrimony made even after a solemn vow, is infringed and broken (not by any

former position, that by the law of God, it is better for a votarie incontinent
to marry then to burn, and that this match is firm and inviolable. To
conclude, the relaxation of such kind of vows which their own Popes have
ratified by their common Nonnulli Ecclesiastici, and iuris Ecclesiastici

interpretations, may stop their mouths who condemn such marriages as being
in themselves violable, and to be dissolved. Hitherto we have proved the
impiety of their now Romish doctrine, by the testimonies of Fathers, by their
own contradictorie positions, and public practices of their Popes. Our last
question remains,

Whether the state of Protestants or of Romanists be more safe in the doctrine
of the liberty of Marriage in their Clergy: resolved by the manifold and
grievous complaints of our learned Adversaries.

78 Howsoever, their clamours against us may easily be repressed by the
complaints of their own sober Divines against themselves: we shall not need to

The Bishops of later times (says he) have offended, by their turning of a law
of single life into a snare for the souls of young Nouices, being rather
willing to conceal filthy commixtions, then to alter their humane
constitutions: and by their too rigorous exacting of their law, have occasioned
most abominable scandals in the Church. Wherefore if ever, certes in these our
days the change of that law may be thought necessary. A second: (...)

If any shall but consider the condition of our times, how that innumerable
Monks (the same he speaks also of Priests) live in incest and filthiness, he
will peradventure think it more convenient to allow them marriage. A third:

I think it were behouefull (says he) for the souls of many, if they might
be permitted to marry: because we find by experience that the law of single
life has brought forth a contrary effect; seeing that in these days they
defile themselves with sin, when as they might live chastely with their own
wives. For the Church should discharge the part of a good Physician, who when
by experience he finds one medicine rather hurt then help, he remoueth it,
and applies another. A fourth, Cum natura nostra body fragilis, sit, and

Never was there more cause of toleration of marriage in secular priests, then
in these our unlucky times, wherein (alas) scarce one of fifty lives chaste,
but most rejecting the ancient holy constitutions of Councels, wallow in
incontinencie. Wherefore many both before our days, and now also, have thought
it more requisite, that this law of single life were dispensed with, rather
then to leave open a window for men, contrary to the law of God, to live in
sin: because it is not to be doubted but that, by this license of marriage,
both concubinary fellowships may be abolished, and the hatred of our
Adversaries against the Clergy removed.

79 This our last witness may seem to acknowledge a public confluxe and
permission of concubines. A thing so notorious in the practice of the Romish
Officials, that their learned Turpissimum est, quod Officiales permittunt

Esa. 15. 1. and 23. 1.

that the story reported by the Magdeburgians is true, signifying that Scribit

who abhor (says he) to consort with people, but reseruedly dwell in
solitariness, thereby seeking to gain a more reverend estimation among men,
and so more easily infect the world with their pernicious doctrine. We wish
that in this description given by S. Gregory, all guilty persons would behold
their own reflections, and furthermore consider, that it is as natural an
itch to be weary of any worldly vocation, and seek priuatenesse, as it is for
a man scorched with the heat of the Sun, to desire a shade; insomuch as
their own Dominus Luc. 9. sic praecepit [Tolle crucem ^^am:] at multae
con^ugatae omittentes curam domus suae, obsequium, quod viris suis debent,

Preacher can tell us of many married women amongst them, who casting away the
care of their family, and duty of subjection to their husbands, contrary to
the precept of Christ [Take up thy cross, etc.] do take upon them the cross
of Nuns. Besides these proofs of novelty, it will not be impertinent to note

Some confessed points in the now Romish Monastical life, as other arguments
of Superstition.
SECT. 38.
83 The ancient state of the Monks, which especially in the days of the peace
of the Church was a school of discipline, and seminary of plants, prepared by
reading the Scriptures, and prayers, with other exercises of learning and
devotion (lest we may seem to feine a Platonicall Idea of things) unto the
ministry of the Church, is that which (our Adversaries witnessing as much)
Ancients professed, and See Bellar. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 6.
Protestants do now require: but this now Romish Monachisine is wrapped in
manyfold superstitions. First is their attributing of perfection unto that
state, because of the vow of poverty, grounded, as they say, upon that saying
of Christ unto the young man, Math. 19. 21.
If thou will be perfect, sell all, and give unto the poor, and thou shall
have treasure in heaven. Which, if it be applied unto us, Ibi mandatam esse
nobis paupertate^ habitualem, non actualem, non vt iam omnia abjiciamus quae
babemus, sed vt cum confessio diuini nomints and gloria Christi postulauerit,
tu omnia deserere parati simus. Guilielmas de Sancto A more, vt citat
Hospinianus de Orig. Monach. lib. 6. c. 17. And it is also cited by Aquinas,
opusc. 19.
does not require always (as their own Doctor teaches) an actual, but an
habitual relinquishing of worldly wealth: signifying a Christian resolution in
every one that shall hope for life, to be prepared always rather to lose all
worldly wealth, then to forsake the profession of his Jesus, in whom only he
has an interest unto eternal life; like as the disposition of a Merchant, who
purposes always in danger of shipwreck rather to throw all his goods
ouer-boord, then to hazard his dearest life.

84 As for the bond of a vow, their learned Attend, prudens lector, null^m
indicitur votum volentibus vitae perfectione assequi, quia non in vinculis
votorum consistit perfectionis assequutio. Caicta^. Cardinal. Comment. in
Matthew. 19.
Cardinal has commented truly: Christ (says he) imposed not upon any a vow
for the attaining unto perfection; certainly no such a Monastical vow. The vow
of Christian perfection, wherewith every baptized soul is bound, which has
sacramentally given up himself unto our captain Christ Jesus, is indeed
always to leave the world, so that possessing it, we may be never possessed
thereof: but the point of Romish superstition, which accompanies that vow, may
seem to be this, to call that a poverty which indeed is a plenty: for what is
it to want Proprium dicro^s duobus modis: 1. quoad dominium and propr^etatem:
2. ^odo quoad detentionern, vsum, and administratio^em, and possessionem facti

heathen could devise a rich commonweal, wherein no man might challenge a

85 Secondly their Apostoli erant primi Monachi Christiani. Bellarm. lib. 2. de
Monach. cap. 5. ^. Sexth probatur.
Cardinal Bellarmine to dignifie the state Monastical, does entitle the
Apostles the first Monks in Christianity: but their Bishop Nec scio qua
ratione isti Monachi, qui vulgo Mendicantes vocantur, qui solum precarium
quastum faciunt, vnde se sustinent, debent semper in mendicando haerere; quando
satis constat Apostolos non ocios expectasle ab alijs victum. Espencaeus in
Tim. d^gress. lib. 3.
Espencaeus disliketh the Orders of begging Monks, as repugnant unto the
example of the Apostles. Which taxation we think to be just; for all able
persons who will beg and not work, the Apostle has pronounced, as 2 Thessalonians.
3. 10.
(...), that is, disordered. Herein therefore we observe another blemish of
superstition, namely the establishing of such an Order, which is in it self a
disorder; and in pretense of the imitation of the Apostles as the first Monks,
to seem in degree of perfection (in relinquishing all) to excel them. For
when they were sentabroad without scrippe or staff, and wanted nothing, our
Savior told them the reason, Luc. 10. 7.
The labourer is worthy of his hire; signifying that that which they received
of men, was but the due wage of their labor. What need we use many words? the
wisdom of the Jesuits Order may sufficiently condemn such Mendicants (who
profess to beg and preach) of notable folly: for their first Ignatius Loyola
diligenter curabat, vt dum in studijs versarentur, ita nostris (Iesuitis) ad
vsus vitae necessarios esset prouisum, vt absque vlla victus solicitudine
viuerent: aieb ^t enim in summa mendicitate sapientiae studium haud facile
posse consistere. Rabad^^tra Ies. de vita Ignatij. lib. 2. cap. 1. page 107.
father Ignatius sought to provide for them, that they might have sufficiency
of victuals, because learning is not easily attained unto in extreme beggerie.

86 The third point is the opinion of merit, which they ascribe unto their
prescribed monastical vows: believing that Dicimus quidem opera Religionis
(meaning Monastical) mentoria esse vitae aetemae, si a justice fiant, and
conducere ad satisfactionem pro peccatis, sicut caetera omnia bona opera.
Bellar. quo supra, cap 6.
they are meritorious of eternal life, and auailable for satisfaction for
sins. Which conceit of merit is a leaven of superstition, which Christians
ought especially to abhor, as the doctrine of S. See before. 14. number. 29.
Gregory does fully demonstrate.

87 Again, when they profess to leave all, and follow Christ, they are found
as certainly not to follow Christ, as they have been proved not to leave all:
for (which is a fourth degree of their vanity, and may well deserve the surname
of hypocrisy) Ignatius Loyola the grand father of all Jesuits, that he might
make himself Ignatius vt exemplo suo omnes ad verae humilitatis studium

one is there, who being a member (whether eye, ear, head or foot,) of the
mystical body of Christ which is his Church, who is not bound by godly
example to profit another? which (even in the judgment of their own Jesuit)
they do not, who are so abstractiutly Eremiticall. How shall not that saying of

places, there to become Eremites, says, that such are persuaded thereunto by
Satan, and in the end find, by miserable experience, the truth of that saying
which is written, [ Eccles. 4. 10.
Woe unto him, who is alone; for if he shall fall, he has none to support him.]
True, therefore are we commanded to Galat. 6. 2.

by dehortation to remove; or by love to cover the imperfections of others. To
conclude, our Lord Jesus that great Michael was only able to fight with the
Dragon, and to enter conflict with him in the Desert, by a monomachie and
single combat; which if man shall attempt, he may peradventure forget he is a
man, but such an one, who (as Luther. Conc. 11.
M. Luther reports) would not acknowledge his own Mother: which is an high
degree of misanthrop^e, and hatred of mankind: but true Justice (says S.
Gregory) has compassion, feined justice has indignation. From these more
material questions we come unto circumstantiall: m Luther. Enarrat. in Matthew.

CHAP. III. Concerning such ceremonies as have been used in the time of S.
Gregory: and have already been specified above by the Apologists.
First in general.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Doctor Humfrey says, that Gregory brought in, Onus ce^emoniarum, a burden of
ceremonies, etc.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing the excess of Ceremonies in the days of S.
Gregory.
SECT. 1.
AFter inquisition made into the real and bodily parts of doctrine, which has
been discussed, there is objected unto us the doctrine of external rites and
ceremonies, which (they say) Ecclesia caeremonias adhibuit, vt mysticas
benedictiones, lumma, thymiamata, vestes, aliaque id genus ex Apostolica
disciplina and traditione, quo and maiestas tanti sacrificij commendaretur, and
mentes fidelium per haec visibilia signa pietatis ad rerum altissimarum, quae
in hoc sacrificio latent, contemplationem excitarentur. Council. Trident. de
Sacrifi^. Missa. Sess. 22. c. 5.
have been invented by the Church, as garments to grace the body. But whether
such garments, De feriarum obseruatione (speaking of amiquitis) m^^a erat
pa^citas. B. Rhe^^ms An^^t. in Tertull. de Corona Milit. Bafil. anno 1562.
which in ancient times (as their own learned Rhenanus observes in holy
days) were very few, did not grow by the days of S. Gregory to a multitude
far too heavy for the body of the Church to bear, will easily appear unto
us by due conference of former times. For first their Jesuit Salmeron
undertaking to answer why in the primitive Church there was very few
ceremonies, he so reasons as though he had intended to preuaricate in his
cause: Deinde primitiui magis essentialibus fides plantandis quam ceremonijs
vacabant. Tertio non erat tot abusus necessitatem legu^ docentes, cum pauci
essent Christ^ professores. 4. cum essent spirituales, magnaque fide praediti,
non indigebant tot incitamentis ad essentialia, and in alijs, quae talia non
lunt, non ita passi essent se colere. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 32. page 253.
One reason was (says he) because in the primitive Church there was not so
many abuses which might so necessarily require new laws: another cause was,
for that those of the primitive Church were more spiritual, and stronger in
faith, and therefore needed not such kind of inducements, as the Churches of
aftertimes. And shall Protestants, because they apply themselves unto the
simplicity of the Apostolic times in the fewness of ceremonies, be therefore
judged less spiritual? If that famous Bishop of Hippo, and excellent light of
the Latin Church S. Ipsam religionem, quam paucissimis and manifestissimis
celebrationum sacramentis misericordia Dei liberam esse voluit, serui^ibus
onenbus premunt, vt toler abilior sit conditio Iudxorum, qui etiamsi tempus
libertatis non agnoutrint, legalibus tamen sareinis, non humanis prae
sumptionibus subijeiuntur. August. epist 119. ad lanuar. cap. 19.
Augustine (speaking of his own times) could say, that the Church is pressed
(contrary to Christ's merciful institution) with such servile burdens of
ceremonies, that the state of the Jews legal bondage might seem in this
respect more tolerable then the condition of Christians, seeing they (the
Jews) were subject only to Gods ordinances, and not (as the then Christians)
subject to so many presumptions of man's inventions. Can then our Adversaries
think that the Church of Rome in the days of S. Gregory, could be in a more
tolerable case, which, coming 200. years after S. Augustines time, increased as
much in the number of her rites, as of her years; whilst every Bishop
successively desiring that the Christian Service might match both Jews and
Gentiles worship in her outward solemnities, assumed (as their Platina
witnesses) an authority to add some things to the outward ornaments and
rites thereof? Certes, no.

2 But seeing, that in the innouating and multiplying of new rites, Gregory
himself was not the least Agent, because (as it is testified of him) Omnis
Ecclesiastici officij institutio, veteris praesertim, a Gregorio inuenta and
approbata fuit. Platina in vita Greg. And Greg himself makes a kind of
Apolo^^ie of himself for some of his new orders. See Greg counsel to Austin for
new solemnities to be devised by him upon the change of the Pagan-Saxons
Temples into Churches, the rather to draw the people. Epist. lib. 9. ep. 71.
he newly framed and augmented the whole order of the Roman Service; thereby
signifying that the ancient form of Divine Service did not content him, and
also (which their own See above, c. 1.. 3. at the letter h.
Doctor has thought inexcusable in him) imposed some Jewish ceremonies, with
an opinion of moral necessity: besides another superstitious manner of
Gregorus Passi^o Episcopo, de consecratione Oratorij, quod Anio pro sua
deuotione fundarat. -- Si nullum ibi corpus constat humatum, percept^ primitus
donatione legitima, id est, fundos, campulos cum conduma vna, houes domitos
parium vnum, vaccas duas, argenti libras qu^tuor, lectum stratum vnum, in
peculio capita quindecim, armenti capit^ duo, ferramenta numeto quinque,
praesentes liberos a trbutis fiscalibus solidos sex, gestisque municipalibus
alligata, praedictum Oratorium solenniter consecrabis; Presbyterum te quoque
illie constituere volumus Cardinalem, vt quoties praefatus conditor voluerit,
etc. Lib. 10. epist. 12. The like we read verbatim in Gregory, for
consecration of other Churches.
Consecration of Churches, then used by them, and (as we think) in that
regard, long since abolished by their own Church: we cannot esteem otherwise
of these Apologists the^ as of Fencers, who are ready to try their
adversaries skill with such blows, which themselves had not first learned to
ward off. Whose height of presumption will further appear, when we shall
manifest

That the present Church of Rome has notoriously altered the profession of S.
Gregory in the doctrine of the Ceremonies of Religion in four degrees: by the
testimonies of our Adversaries themselves.
The first degree, in the imposition of necessity.
SECT. 2.
3 Little can our Adversaries gain, although it shall be granted, that
Protestants use not the same variable habits of ceremonies, which were invented
by S. Gregory; because, indeed, all ordinances of man are, according to the
wisdom of Churches, variable and changeable. And albeit the now Romish Church
would precisely bind all other Churches, as her handmaids, unto the same
fashion and ceremonious attire, which she her self has prescribed: yet did S.

August. Monachum, vt est apud. P. Diaconum. The same is in Gregor. epist. lib.
12. page 1190.
Gregory acknowledge an unity of faith among Christians, notwithstanding
their dissent in matter of ceremony: and therefore yielded unto his Austen a
liberty to choose, whether in the Church of Rome, or of France, or elsewhere,
whatsoever ceremony might seem most acceptable unto the will of Almighty
God; and to ordain and establish such rites in the Church of England. This is
that liberty which our Church of England, according to S. Gregory his
moderation, now challenges, and by the mercy of God enjoys, notwithstanding
the opposition of the Romish Church, which will peremptorily reign as the
only Queen of Churches: for how will she permit others to prefer the
ordinances of any other Churches before her own, who would have compelled the

for ministering the cup to all present, according to the first institution, and

the new Testament.] As appears in the Oration of Gaspar, at the Council of
Trent, reported by the first Gallobelgicus.
Bohemians to prefer her own tradition before Christ's?

The second degree of abuse, in the multitude of Romish ceremonies.
SECT. 3.
4 That there is in the Roman Church, as it were, a deluge of ceremonies, any
one may discern that will but compare the Pentateuch of Moses, and the There
be, 1. Sacrarum caeremoniarum Romanae Ecclesiae libri tres. 2. Pontificale
Romanum in tres parts distinctum. 3. Missale Romanum continens Rubricas
Missalis, 2. ritus celebrandi Missam, 3. defectus circa Missam occurrentes.
Romish Missals and Rituals, which in number of rites do far exceed the
Synagogue of the Jews, in fasts, in festiuals, in sacrifices, in altars, in
habits, in orders, in vestments, in Canons, besides censings, kneelings,
kissings, crossings, whisperings, with many like kinds so manifestly
importable, that many of their own men have prevented our complaints, saying,
that Alia ratio antiqui temporis, alia moderni: eo euim tempore non arctabantur
fideles tot Canonum and Decretorum praeceptis, censuris aut poenis, nec erant
tune, vt ita dixerim tot laquei legum, seu constitutionum, excommunicationum,
sieve censurarum, a quibus vix fideles etiam diligentissimi and timorati
praecauere possint; non tot ieiunia indicta, non vigiliae, non diuturna pariter
and nocturna officia dietim ex praecepto dicenda, non denique tot festa
calenda, non tam crebra confessio, and corporis Christi communicatio, non tot
obedientiarum praestationes, sicut modo fideles arctantur, aut potitis
inuoluuntur: ita vt recte de Praelati^ Ecclesiae dici pos^^ illud Christi;
Alligant onera importabilia. etc. Rode^icus Episcop. Samorens. lib. 2. Spec.
cap. 29.
in ancient times the people of God were not subject to so many decrees,
precepts, punishments, excommunications, censures, etc. which the most diligent
can hardly prevent: not so many fasts, vigils, feasts, wherewith the faithful
are continually entangled. Granting that, Aetas Hieronymi, preter die^
Dominicum, paucissima nouerat festa. Nu^c feriarum neque finis, neque modus;
quae cum primitus ad pietatis vacatione paucae sunt institutae, nunc ad

there is neither end nor measure in the multitude of holy days; which (say
they) Turba festorum dierum, quos vel Episcopi multitudinis indulgentes

Bishops or Popes invented to pamper the affections of the people. Adding that

worships, meats, habits. Not denying but Plus body Christiani quam olim Iudgi,

Christians are now more oppressed with ceremonies, then were the Jews in
former times. Concluding that Sylua quaedam Iudaicarum and Gentilium

a very wood of heathenish ceremonies pestereth the Lords field; and that
Onera, quae Ministri aliqui imponunt humeris hominum, sunt importabilia, non
onus Christi. Caiet an. comment in Matthew. 11. haec verba [Iugum meum suaue]
the burdens which some Ministers impose upon men's shoulders, are importable;
and not the burden of Christ.

5 Is it possible but our Adversaries should have heard these so full and loud
clamours of their own men, professing in effect, that the thombes of later
Gregory's are become (in respect of the burden of ceremonies) heavier then the
Ioynes of that ancient S. Gregory? If they do understand thus much, then let
them put in practice their profession borrowed from S. Augustine; Fat^mur
Catholici, caeremonias non esse nimis multiplicandas, ita vt sua multitudine
obruant quodammodo religionem, cui setuire debent Vt enim agricolae cupiunt in
vitibus praeter vuas etiam pampinos, quibus ornentur and adiuuentur vuae, sed
si nimium pampini crescant, and impediant potius quam iuuent, eas resecant: ita
faciendum esse in ^i^^bus, docet Augustinus, epist. 119. cap. 19. Bellarm. de
effect. Sacrament. lib. 2. cap. 30.. His addunt.
Too great multitudes of Ceremonies may not be used in the Church of God: but
even as dressers of vines will suffer the branches and leaves to grow so long
as they may be an help and grace unto the grapes, and as soon as they hinder
their growth, they cut them off: so must the Church do in the exceeding
multitude of Ceremonies. But if notwithstanding all this acknowledgement, they
shall still suffer their superfluous sprigs and leaves to annoy the spiritual
vine, they are to be put in mind of the voice of Christ, denouncing a Matthew.
23. 3.
woe unto such as say, and do not.

The third degree of the abuse of Ceremonies, is in their vain and
superstitious significations.
SECT. 4.
6 As Ceremonies have been (a point already confessed) so many for multitude,
that by their burden they have oppressed the Church; so may they possibly be,
by their vanity, so light and ridiculous, and in their use so superstitious,
that they may greatly disgrace and corrupt it. Now whether many of the Romish
rites be of this kind, we shall need no other trial then that which by the
evidence of their own writings shall appear. It is the now Romish profession,
to think that their Potest Ecclesia instituere nouas caeremonias, non quide^
ad iustific andum impium (id est, propri^ Sacramenta) sed ad alios effectus
spir^tuales, vt ad morbo^ curandos, pellendos daemones, and peccata ^entalia
purganda, non solum per mod^m impetrationis, de quo question non est; sed etiam
(quod probabile est) per applicationem meritorsi Christi, ita vt illos effectus
ex opere operato producant, quomodo sacramenta ex opere operato iustificant.
Bellar. de effect. sacram. lib. 2. cap. 31.. Tertia propositio.
Church may ordain new Ceremonies, (thus says their Cardinal Bellarmine)
although not as properly Sacraments for justification of sinners, yet
available unto other spiritual effects, as to drive away devils, to purgs our
venial sins, not only by way of supplication (which (says he) is most
certain) but also (which is probable) by way of application of Christ's (...)

13 Vestments or habits in the Church, our Centurists do not deny, nor we
dislike, if but few and seemly, serving both for a decorum, and a Religio

these members of fifteen vestments, and their mystical senses to be truly
ancient, as their so many signified virtues to have been common to all that use
them.

14 What shall we stand upon other fragments objected? Our Christian Reader may
well understand, that our Authors in alleging so many particular ceremonies
which were used in the time of S. Gregory, do take exception unto all, as
being too many; not unto every one, as in it self unlawful or superfluous;
which in some of them has been already declared. So be it likewise known
unto all our Adversaries, that the too many ceremonies used by S. Gregory,
cannot excuse their now far more multitudes; nor can some of his not good,
justify their much worse rites, and inuentio^s, as in the formerly specified
particulars has appeared. Whereunto may be added their other new inventions of

crossing of the cup with the host, and twice crossing between his own breast
and the cup: besides a number of other crossings which after follow in the

15 Concerning these and such like infinite, so superstitious, and so seriously
foolish ceremonies, we may learn sobriety. For if S. Augustine did lament the
miserable vanity of his time, because that some of the governors of the
Church Hoc nimis dolco, quod multa, quae in diuinis literis saluberrime
praecipiuntur, minus curantur, and tam multis praesumptio^ibus, tam plena sunt

less regarding obedience unto the commandments of God, then their own
humane ordinances and presumptions: how much more cause have our adversaries
now to acknowledge their like oppression by their ceremonies, the burden
whereof made some of their own Bishops further thus to groan even under but
one kind: O qu^m multa hodie in religio^ibus praecepta! quot vincula
multiplicata! ^ quim pauca, and tarda remedia! de quibus dicere videtur
Christus, [Alligant oner^ grauia and importabilia, and imponunt ea in humeris

Diverse Popes have invented and prescribed unto Christians diverse religious
ceremonies, whereby (which ouercometh the rest in admiration) some think to
aspire unto heaven: being taught sometime by certain Monks, that Non possum

such as should wear the habits of their Order, could not possibly err in
faith. We are weary even with noting the grieuances of their superstitious
ceremonies, whereof their own Authors have so often, so plainly, and so
greatly complained.

16 And yet behold an acccusation more heinous then any of the rest, whereof we
have their learned Bishop Espencaus our witness. He, examining the Romish
Missals, judges them by comparison more deformed then such which were long
before Episcopus Lugdunensis, qui se dixit in Missalibus superflua, ridicula,

censured by the Bishop of Lions as supers^uous, ridiculous, blasphemous; and
in brief, so utterly execrable, that their excellent Scooleman Driedo
suspected them to have been invented by heretics. And will they have us think
that S. Gregory would patronize (we forbear to name their Idolatry,) such
their Missals? Let now our Reader judge whether Church is more semblably the
Spouse of Christ: ours, which seeks to approve her self by composing her
religion unto the fashion of primitive integrity: or theirs, which besides the
vanity, the superstition, the profaneness of many ceremonies, is also
inthralled in a spiritual bondage, and entangled with so ragged Gal. ^. 1.

traditions, that if (as Quamuis sint qui ceremonias a carendo dictas malint.

some think) the name of ceremony came of carendo, well it were that their
Church did want them. It remains that we both free Protestants from the note
of contradiction in this first question, about the faith of S. Gregory, and
that we likewise derive from him our professed Protestant conclusions.

heresy (so they now,) albeit S. Gregory (notwithstanding he uses to
confirm some things by tradition) does so absolutely profess it, as though he
had intended to be partial in our behalf: In hoc volumine omnia, quae
erudiunt, cuncta quae aedificant scripta continetur. Gregor. in Ezech. l. 1.

Whatsoever (says he) serves for edification, is contained in the volume of

Whosoever will avouch any divine truth, must build his speech upon this
foundation: which was so undoubtedly his doctrine, that the learned Doctor of
Paris said, that, according to the judgment of S. Gregory, he is infected with
a Idem seculis sequentibus scripsit Gregorius, cognomento Magnus, Romanus

contagion of heresy, that teaches any substantial point of faith, which is
not contained in Scripture. And this is likewise agreeable unto that
observation used by S. Gregory, saying, that heretics do usually for the
confirmation of their perverse opinions, suggest such proofs as are not found
in Scriptures. Saepe haeretici dum sua student peruersa astruere, ea proferunt,
quae in sacrorum librorum paginis non tenentur. Greg. Moral. lib. 18. ca. 14.

privilege of reading holy Scriptures, and of using the public prayers in a
known tongue: which the now At Catholica Christi Ecclesia, non quide prohibet

is the Epistle of God unto his creature; proving further, that Magnae

diligence therein. And therefore, as it were yielding a public license hereof,

contrariwise teach, that those glorious titles of Spouse, of Christ, and

only failed in the due proof of such particulars as they have mentioned, to
wit, their Sacrifice of the Mass, Transubstantiation, Confession, Free Will,
Merit, Indulgences, etc. but also have not at all mentioned diverse particulars
of moment, which are between us controuertible; concerning the Canon of
Scripture, with the vulgar use; the authority of a Council above the Pope;
the sovereignty of an Emperor in causes temporal; the private Mass,
Halfe-communion, Adoration of the Eucharist, the seven Sacraments, Ablution and
purging of venial sins by holy water; together with other their newly
invented See before.
Traditions, and ceremonies: which are (as has been confessed) either by their
number, burdensome; or by their significations, vain and frivolous; or by
their exactions and opinion of necessity, injurious; or in their use
supersluous; or lastly, in their own nature (such have been their Missals)
very blasphemous.

the inconsiderate importunity of our adversaries the Apologists, who (in their

doctrine of S. Gregory, not only in some one or two points, but even
throughout every particular: concluding from the commendation of his virtue and
learning a necessary belief in all) are found to be very impotent and weak
disputers; whose Mayor proposition, viz. such a comme^dable conuerter is
thoroughly to be believed, has been proved a mere non sequitur from their own
examples: their assumption, to demonstrate their religion throughout every
particular, is only a peremptory presumption: because that either most of the
doctrines propounded were not the now Romish profession, or that many other
points of the now Romish profession have not been propounded; and therefore do
they remain chargeable to recant this their first demonstration of their
Apology in the most particulars.

the two (memorable) brethren named Eualdi, whom they therefore call
papisticall.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
Our Authors reading of bitter contentions then risen between some ancient
Germans, and a Roman Conuerter Boniface, and not being able certainly to
define, whether those Irenaeus and alij Patres Bonifacio antiquiores
Germanicarum Ecclesiarum meminere. De Germanis resistenubus Bonifacio, viz
Clements, Adelberto, and alijs Episcopis vide Auentinum lib. 3. Annal. and
Naucler, ^^^erat. 25. and 26. ^dit. Colon. 1584
Saxons were then Christians, and also free at that time from any subjection
unto the Bishop of Rome, (as Brittons and Scots anciently had been) did
therefore murder those brethren the Eualdi, as authors of an innovation in
the^r Church: or whether they were Pagans and Idolatrous people, and had
martyred these devout brethren for the profession of the At ^eda writes, lib.
5. lust. cap. 11.
faith of Christ; our Authors (we say) were by this perplexity of story drawn
into an uncertainty of judgment, but so as keeping moderation. For if those
Eualdi were murdered by Infidels (say they) for the profession of Christ, they
are then, doubtless, to be accounted Christ's Martyrs: but if they suffered for
the Roman ceremonies, and jurisdiction, they must then be accounted his
Martyrs in whose quarrel they died.

2 Which supposall, viz. that they died in defense of the Roman rites Si ab
Ethnicis propter religionem Christian^ (...) fuer^^t, reuers etiam Christi
Martyrs fuerunt: quod si vero quia Romanas caeremonias in Ecclesiam inuehere
conati sunt, ^nter ver^s Martyrs non sunt numer andi. Osiander Cent 7. lib. 4.

and of Papal authority, moved one to call them Papisticall Martyrs: not
thereby implying the general Romish religion, no more then Pater Paulus that
Venetian Doctor (whose picture the Romanists took, and therein adjudged him
unto the fire, calling him therefore Mezzo Lutherano, for defending but one
only doctrine prejudicial unto the Papal authority,) could be properly said,
to have defended the whole profession of Luther.

3 And if notwithstanding they shall insist in their claim of these two for
suffering death in maintenance of a Papal jurisdiction over foreign Churches,
miserable will be their issue, especially considering, that we have many twoes
to oppose against these, even a thousand and two hundred religious Brittons;
who in a resolute resistance of that jurisdiction and authority of Austen the
Legate of S. Gregory, died under the hands of Pagans, and (as See above chap.
4. lit. f.
Galfride speaks) suffered martyrdom. If contrariwise the forenamed Eualdi
(as is more See Bid lib. 5. hist. Eccles. c. 11.
probable) be understood to have suffered death by the rage of Infidels, for
preaching the glorious name of Christ; they then are to be esteemed his Martyrs
whose cause they maintained: and then in that respect may our Apologists as
soon separate us from Christ, as these Eualdi from us.

argument of these disputers, from one Article to conclude an acknowledgement of
all, is no better then from the sight of a man's head upon the top of a pole, to
infer the presence of the whole body.

5 But be it granted (for so it is) that the Papal Primacie, beginning in
Boniface the third, is now 900 years old: yet is it true (by their own
confession) that S. Gregory preceding Boniface in that Chair, did in
himself, and in the name of all his predecessors disclaim, and detest the
same See above cap. 2.. 29.
title of Romish Prelacie. So then truth being always truth, and admitting no
shadow of change by alteration or interruptions of time, our Adversaries for
the gaining of 900 years of the continuance of Popedom ex facto, that is, by
way of fact or event, must necessarily yield unto us de iure, that is, by way
of right, the truth of our cause from the antiquity of 1500. That is the 900,
from Boniface unto these latter times, and 600 years before Boniface unto
Christ.
years: so damnifiable is the gain which they so earnestly have sought.

6 Their second witness (M. Napier) seems to them to deal more liberally,
yielding unto them an interrupted prescription of twelve hundred and sixty
years, and that without any debatable contradiction. Which testimony, together
with the next of M. Brocard, our adversaries have repeated seven several times
in this Apology, proving them to be, as it were, the two Hercules his pillars,
beyond which we may not pass. But this witness (alas for the darkness of
judgment of these Apologists) speaks not of the whole profession of the
Romish Church, but only of one Article predominant therein, namely the
doctrine of Popedom; neither yet do they absolutely confess this to have
been, so long time, vndebatably ancient and universal. For M. M. Napier his
own words are as clear as the day, to signify that he does not speak in
general of the whole body of the Romish faith, and of the universal antiquity
thereof, which is the point in question; but only of the first original of
the Papal dominion, and Antichristian kingdom, as he calls it: which he
accordingly begins at that certain year, in which imper^all rob^s, a
triple crow^^, and a tem^^rall dominio, are said to have been first given by
Constantine to Pope Syluester and his successors: for he says: We must begin
our account at the Popes first power and authority, even at this first
coronation^ and this was about the year of our Lord 316, when the Emperor
Constantine gave Syluester the great temporal dominions and triple crown

these obiectors, our reader may weigh the worth of their credit.

7 If notwithstanding this our euiction and proof, thy shall contend to show
from the ingenuous confession of M. Napier, that this Article of Papal
Primacie was 1260, years received universally without any debatable
contradiction; yet durst we appeal unto our Adversaries themselves for a
confutation of such a fiction; for they cannot be ignorant, that the now

CHAP. IX. Concerning the faith of the ancient Brittons of Wales.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And this faith was also agreeable to that first faith, whereto the Brittons of
Wales were converted in the Apostles times.. 3.

In so much that whereas our learned Adversaries do truly affirm, (as being
undoubted) that our neighbors the Brittons of Wales, M. Camden in his
Britannia etc. page 40. circa med. says, Certum est Britannos in ipsa
Ecclesiae infantia Christianam religionem imbibisse: In proof whereof he there
alleges sundry ancient authorities, page 40. circa med. And page 157. paulo
post med he says: In hac floruit monasterium Glastenburie, quod antiquam
repetit originem a Iose^ho Arimathensi, etc. hoc enim and antiqu(...)
monasterij monumenta restantur, etc nec est c^r de hac reambigamus. And M
Harison in his description o^ Br^tta^ne annexed to Holinshead his great
Chronicle of the last edition, vol. 1. pa 23. a. l. 18. says: that Joseph
preached here in England in the Apostles times, his sepulcher yet in
Glastenbury, and Epitaph affixed thereto is proof sufficient. Also M. Enoch

conversion of the Britt^ns in the Apostles times, faith the^of Our Schismatics
may as well ask me what assurance I have there was a King Henry, as demand
what assurance I have of the other. This point is also yet further affirmed By
M. Doctor Fulke, in his book against Heskins, Sanders, etc. page 561. sect. 71
and in his confutation of Purgatory, page 332. Also by M. Godwine, in his
catologue of Bishops, etc page 1. initio.

med. says: The Catholic Brittons, with whom Christian religion had continued
in succession from the Apostles times, would not receive Austine. And in his
answer to a counterfeit Catholic, page 49 fine, he says: The Brittons before
Austins coming, continued in the faith of Christ even from the Apostles times.
And M. Fox in his Acts and Monu^ents printed 1576. page 463. 2, circa med.
says: The Brittons after the receiving of the faith, never forsook it for any
manner of false preaching of other, nor for torments etc.
faith by the preaching of the Apostles, and held that faith at Austens coming,
not being (as they yet further affirm) in the mean time In proof that the
Brittons of Wales, at and before Austines coming into England, were not altered
by the Roman^ Church: M. D. Humfrey in Iesuitismi, part 2. rat. 3. page 304.

Fulke in his confutation of Purgatory, page 372. initio, says: It appears

Church, before the t^me of the Saxons.
altered or corrupted by the Roman Church: in the special proof whereof (as
being most certainly true) M. D. Barlow in his defense of the articles of the
Protestants religion, page 21. affirms, the Church of the Brittons to be as
ancient every day, and as Christian every way as the Roman: affirming further,
the integrity thereof (or not being altered by the Church o^ Rome) first, by
their observation of Easter different from Austine: Se^ondly, by the oppositi^n
which they made against Austine.
Mr. D. Barlow seriously labors. It is nevertheless evident by S. Bid who
lived Bid did write his history thereof, anno 724. as witnesses M. Cowper in
his Chronicle, fol. 168. b.

acknowledged since by Protestant writers, that upon conference then had at a
place, thereof called in Bedes time Beda hist. lib. 2. cap. 2. initio, says:

thing is also as yet more certainly evident, as well in that the Britton Bishops

confessed, that it was the right way of justice and righteousness which
Austen taught: as also for that M. Fulke in his confutation of Purgatory, page
335. prope finem.
Austen did (as M. Fulke affirms) at the last obtain the aid of the
British Bishops to the conversion of the Saxons: So evidently does that faith
which Austen taught us, and which the Protestants acknowledge for Popish,
demonstrate it self in general to be consonant and agreeable with that
primitive f^^th, whereunto the Brittons of Wales were (as is confessed)
converted in the Apostles times.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
WE have seen by how willing and weak fallacies they have sought the defense
of an ancient and universal approbation of their now Romish faith in general.
In this their next argument they have given us more experience either of their
silliness, or (we know not whether rather to term it) of their subtlety, as
may be manifested by this examination following, viz.

What, and of how great importance the differences were between those
Brittane Bishops, and the then Church of Rome.
SECT. 2.
2 The points were (say the Apologists) only dissenting from the Roman Church
in their ceremonies, or ministering of Baptism, and keeping of Easter: which
are matters (in their estimate) but of smaller importance: which therefore
again they call Apolog. in the ^argent, at the note *.
fewer and smaller points. But venerable Bede by them cited, does intimate a
third point of difference, to wit, a denial of subjection unto Austen, or the
Sea of Rome, insinuated by the speech of Austen unto them, Si in tribu^ his
mihi obtempera^e vultis, caetera quae agitis, quamuis moribus nostris
contraria, aequanimites cuncta tolerabimus. Augustinu^ Monachus apud Bedam,
lib. 2. hist. cap. 2.
Modo mihi obtemperare, etc. that is, So that you will obey me in these things,
etc. But more expressly by the answering of the Brittane Illi respondebant, se
nihil horum facturos, neque illum p^o Archiepiscopo habituros. Beda ibid. Which
is better cleared by Galfridut, as appears by the question of the lawfulness
of offering for the dead, which Boniface an English Saxon, sent by the Pope to
convert the Germans, desired to be satisfied in by Gregory the second.
Bishops, saying, We will not do any thing which thou have required, neither
will we acknowledge thee our Archbishop.

3 Neither did M. Fox (as the Apologists would seem to suggest) reprove the
Brittons for resisting the authority of Austen, but A^^ cannot but accuse
Austin. etc. so I cannot but think the Brittons much more too blame, who
neglected so much their spiritual duty, in revenging their temporal wrong,
that they denied their help for the turning of the Idolatrous Saxons to the
way of salvation. M. Fox in the place objected. See hereof above, cap. 4.
for not consenting unto the work of converting the Infidels. And how could
these disputers call their points of difference, matters of smaller importance,
seeing because of a professed renunciation of the Roman jurisdiction, their
own Cardinal Synodum habuit Augustinus Metropolitanus cum Episcopis antiquae
Britannorum Ecclesiae, iam olim a communione Catholicae Ecclesiae diro
schismate a^te diuisis. Baronius anno 604. number. 55. And because they would not
yield subjection, he says: Plane vides Britannorum Episcoporum eorundemque.
schismaticorum animu^ refractariu^, ab vnitate Catholicae Ecclesiae penitus
resilientem Ibid. nis. 60.
Baronius does not spare to term both the Churches of Brittan and of Eadem
plane, qua Britanni pariter and Scoti erant schismatis fu^igine tincti, and
discessionis ab Ecclesia Romana rei Baroniu^^^. number 65.
Scotland, schismatic, and divided from the communion of the Catholic
Church?

4 What kind of points they stood upon, may be best coniectured by the general
subject of their question, which was about the Tunc Britones quidem confitentur
intellexisse se veram esse iustitiae viam, quam praedicauit Augustinus. Apolog.
ex Beda. The Apologists do here openly confound two several conferences of
Austine and the Brittons, seeing the last and national Council of the while
Britain Clergy did never acknowledge unto Austine that he taught the right
way of justice, as Beda affirms at large. Those, who thus yielded, were a
private assembly of a few. Beda ibid.
true way of justice, and righteousness, and concerning the way of eternalll
life, and salvation; doubtless matters of great moment. Which is hereby more
probable, because afterward both the Brittons, Scots, and Irish Bishops, so
utterly rejected their doctrine, that the Bishop Cognoscentes Britones, Scotos
meliores putauirnus: Scotos vero per Digamum Episcopum and Columbanum Abbatem
(in Hibernia) nihil discrepare a Britonibus in ipsorum conuersatione didicimus.

in codem hospitio cibum sumere vol^it. Laurentius, Augustins successor, apud
Bedam hist. Angl. lib. 2. cap. 4.
Dagamus denied all communion with them; yea and refused to eat bread in the
same Inn wherein the Romish Bishops did lodge: which must imply causes of some
weighty importance.

5 The point of celebration of the day of Easter, which the Apologists do here
lightly pass over as a matter of small importance, was indeed before that time
(in the censure of the Church of Rome) thought a matter of so (...)

Whether it can advantage our Adversaries to insist upon the Liturgies of the
Grecians and Armenians.
SECT. 3.
5 As yet we may be thought to have kept aloof; therefore do we approach nearer
unto their objection, answering as our learned D. Fulk in his answer to Allens

ci^ing him so often our of that books.

much altered, yet do they differ as much from the Romish Mass, as it differs
from the form of our communion. For he that looks in these marginall

of lame conclusions. Whereof we shall have yet more experience in the next
section.

Christians of Armenia and India consented to the Roman Church, and that the
Greeks agreed, etc. Also Abdisu Primate of the Armenians subscribed to the
late Council of Trent.
submission to our Catholic Church.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
FOr proose of this pretended submission of the Grecians unto the Romish
Church, we are first cited by the marginall notes unto the Council of
Florence: whereunto we do correspondently appeal, and desire that their own
Surius may be our Orator, who reports the conclusion of that Council to
stand thus: Summus Potisex Imperatorem togabat, vt doctiores ex Potificibus
suis ad ipsum mitteret, qus ^slas duas ambiguitates mehus explicare scirent.
Imperator autc^ nolens Episcopos suos de talibus quaestionibus agere,
indoctiores ad Pontificem misit, a quibus cum eadem ipse Pontifex repeujsset,
hi responderunt, se nullam habere ad ^slhaec respondendi ^acultatem, Imperatori
autem se omnia relaturos. Notwithstanding a little after the Pope said to the
Grecians: Cum fratres Deigratia coniuncts sumus, etc A little after, the Greek
Patriarch being ^ow suddenly dead, the Pope labors to persuade the Grecians
to elect now another Patriarch, whom he might confirm, to this end promising,
that he would depose another, whom without their consent he had before time,
even tempore dissidij, elected Patriarch. Concerning this point concluding
thus: Fires iure non potest, vt nisi Patriarcham vestrum h^c elig^^etis,
electun. a nobis in posterum deponamus. Graeciresp. Patriarcham vero nostrum
extra Constantinopolin nostro (...) neut^quam elig^ posse: and hoc Imperator
consuctudin^s nostrae non inscius, nequaquam permittet, vt hic electronem
huiusmodi faciamus. This (...) their conclusion, and immediately they took
their mutual farewell. Surius Tom. 4. (...) page 469. So (...) Binius.
The Pope requiring conference with certain Greek Doctors, the Greek
Emperor then present restrained them: and the Pope earnestly desiring to
confirm a new Patriarch among these Grecian Bishops, they absolutely refused
his confirmation, as disagreeing from the custom of their Church.

2 Although therefore there had been an union of the Grecians with the Romans
in this Council, yet (without which at this day the Romish acknowledge Bellar.
Ies. Valentian. Ies. Vasques Ies. See above cap. 9.. 2. lit. m.
no union) we see no subjection: as hereafter will more fully appear.

3 Their second claim of the consent of the Armenians, taken only from the
His omnibus explicatis, praedicts Armenorum Oratores, nomine suo, and sui
Patriarchae, and omnium Armenorum, hoc celeberrimum Synodole Decsctum omnibus
suis capitulis acceptant, nec-non quicquid docet Romana Eeclesia. Decret.

decree of Pope Eugenius, is so vnconsonant, that their last and best
Chronologer, and compiler of the Councels, Binius, for the warranting ofit, is
brought into a marvelous distraction, not knowing whether Vnde necessario
colligitur, Graecos and Armenos huc-vsque Florentiae permansi^le; vel, qu^d
probabilius est, eandem Synodum post abitum Graecorum and Armenorum aliquot
Sessionibus, qua^um Acta nulla extant, continuatats; vel saltem quandam aliam,

Eugenij, celebratam fuisle. Binius, Tom. 4 Conc. page 503.
the Armenians continued at the Council of Florence, or whether after the
departure of the Grecians and Armenians, there were some other Sessions of the
Council continued, which have not been recorded; or whether there had been
another Synod gathered the same year. For certain it is, those Armenians
uttered not one word in the Council of Florence. Thus whilst by the Council
they labor to confirm the consent of the Armenians, they have not a little
disabled the evidence of their Councels, supposing that there were Sessions and
Acts, which have not been recorded.

4 Their last additament, signifying the consent of Abdisu, Primate of the
Armenians, as subscribing to the Council of Trent: because it is only
affirmed by themselves, without any witness, we pass over as sufficiently
confuted by a learned Festiua fabula de Abdilu Patriarcha Aslyriae, and argu^c
excog^rata: Cardinalis Amulius (qui Romae apud Pontificem agebat) liter as ad

Lawyer, not hitherto (as we think) herein contradicted by any; by whom it is
rejected as an idle figment. We further reioyne.

The argument of the Apologists from the example of the Greek Church, does
utterly crush the head of Popedom.
SECT. 2.
5 Although their former Assumption, concerning the Apolog. page 8. in the end.
late submission of the Grecians and Armenians to the now Romish Church, were
true; yet were this but new Logic, from a late Act to conclude an ancient
Right.

6 Nevertheless this their Assumption must necessarily be forcible against
themselves, if we shall prove from the testimonies of their own Doctors, that
the Grecians did ordinarily disclaim the now usurped authority of the Bishop
of Rome.

7 Our Adversaries, indeed, make pretense of an acknowledged subjection of the
Grecians unto the Sea of Rome, Sub Innocentio 3. in Concilio Lateranensi Graeci

the Grecians did always envy the supreme authority of their Pope, which they

experience is proved. Wherefore if the example of the Grecians (as is
pretended,) subiecting themselves unto the Church of Rome the space of 10, or
20 years, may induce Christians to submit themselves unto the same Sea; then
the confessed example of the same Greek Church rejecting the now usurped Papal
authority, for many hundred years together, yea even (as might be proved)
always unto this day, must a fortiori persuade us of the novelty of their
Romish claim, and vanity of this their proof. Wherein again they insist.

CHAP. XII. THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And most full and plain witness hereof is the answerable It appears by the
Treatise published by the Protestants, diuer^e of Wittenberg, anno 1584.
entitled Acta theologorum Witebergensium and Hieremiae Patriarchae
Constantinop. etc. that the Greek Church at this day, though divided from the
Latin, professes to believe Innocation of Saints, Relicke, worshipping of
Images, Transubstantiation, Sacrifice, the signifying Ceremonies of the Mass,

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL, Particularizing the Articles of the Grecians.
SECT. 1.
BY this instant pressing us with the examples of the Grecians and Armenians,
we observe the singular diligence of these obiectors, who search all corners to
find out any thing, which may carry in it the least color or shadow of any
argument for advantage of their Romish profession. But we answer, that seeing
in this Greekish case they are contented that we shall consult with the Greek

Nilus, not long since Archbishop of Thessaly, for our advocate in some
particulars, and first begin with the now professed Romish Primacie: The Greek
Church (says he) though it never denied the Primacy of order to the Popes of
Rome, yet that their assumed predominance of authority it always impugned:
viz. that jurisdiction whereby every Pope challenges a power of calling
general Councels, and determining causes at his own discretion, hereby
transgressing the decrees of antiq^itie, the practice and examples of ^lder
godly Popes, and finally, frustrating the formal nature of a Council.

2 In some other opinions the Greeks are in a sort pendulous between both;
they See above,. 3.
do not properly invoke the Saints, nor believe that they hear our praters,
but think only, that the favor they have with God is always auail able for
us. The difference then is, that the Protestants, though they do not inu^cate
the Saints, because they do not hear (a reason Notandum est quod ante aduentum

11 What need any further inquisition? If the dissension of Grecians with
Protestants were so infinite, as is pretended, the Greek Patriarch, writing
unto Protestants, could not have used this doxologie and congratulation unto
them. Nunc Deo omnis gratiae authori gratias agimus, and laetamur cum alijs

shall neither our Authors have cause to mistake the opinions of the Greek
Church, nor the Apologists to take so many ex^eptions. Lastly, let any peruse
these errors following, which both the Protestants and the Romanists
We give thanks unto almighty God (says he) and do rejoice, that in many

Grecians must be held so prejudicial, what account can our Adversaries make

Adversaries call errors and heresies?

12 Or how will they defend their Indulgences for souls departed, the single
life of their Clergy, their obliging consciences in mortal sins by
institution of new laws, their Communion only in one kind, their saying Mass
for the dead, their taking money for Masses, their esteeming Confirmation, and
extreme Unction to be Sacraments? all which (as their own Damianus a Goes
notes) are directly contrary unto the profession of the In epistola

That the former argument used by the Apologists, and taken from the examples
of remote Nations, is not only not judicious; but also (as is proved by the
contradiction of their own men) maruellously ridiculous.
SECT. 3.
13 We are not contented to have made the incircumspection of the Apologists
visible, but contend also (the cause enforcing us hereunto) to make it, as it
were, palpable unto our Reader. And for a more plain manifestation hereof, we
repeat their argument; By the examples of remote Nations (say they) so far
distant one from another, converted doubtless all of them in the Apostles
times, and agreeing with us in many principal points of faith, is not
obscurely signified, that the now Catholic (meaning Romish) Religion, is that
primitive faith, which the Apostles themselves planted in all nations.

14 This is the argument which these obiectors have so vrgently pressed, we
have partly confuted, and now further instance against them, and object the
examples of Moscouites, Egyptians, Aethiopians, Armenians, and other such like
remote Nations, who all have their public prayers in their vulgar and known
tongue. Herunto their Certum est, inquiunt (Protestants) Ruthenos, and
Aegyptios, Aethiopes, and Armenos and quosda^ alios celebrate diuina officia in
lingua vulgari. -- Respondemus, nos non permoueri Barbarorum exempli^. Salmeron
Ies. Com. in 1. Cor. 16. Disp. 30.. 7. page 271.
Jesuit Salmeron is contented to answer, saying, What have we to do with the
custom of such Barbarians? and their Cardinal Obijciunt (Protestants) nunc
Ruthenos, Armenos, Aegyptios, Aethiopes, and nescio quos alios populos suis
vulgaribus linguis sacra facere. Respondeo, exemplis Ruthenorum, Armenorum, and
similium non magis nos moueri, quam moueamur exemplis Lutheranorum,
Anabaptistarum, and Caluinistarum. Sunt enim etiam illi vel haeretici, vel
schismatici. Bollar. lib. 2 de Verbo Dei, cap. vlt. in fine. These examples are
objected by Protestants, not so much to prove the necessity of Prayer in a
known tongue, which is sufficiently proved by Scripture; as to satisfy their
Adversaries demands, who commonly say, that except the three languages of
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, the public Service was not in common tongues of
other nations: so that from the examples of such remote nations the Apologists
dispute de iure, and Protestants rather de facto. Yet Bellarmins has Luely
recanted his former grant: Non omnino approbo hanc solutionem. Bellar. Recog.
oper. page 5.
Bellarmine, no less disdainfully; We are no more moved (says he) with the
examples of Moscouites, Armenians, Egyptians, and Aethiopians, then with the
examples of Lutherans or Anabaptists; turning the argument which was urged by
the Apologists, for (as they have pretended) no obscure signification of a
Catholic Religion, into a scorn and reproach, as relishing no better in their
taste then an humor barbarous, or Anabaptisticall.

15 Whereby the discreet Reader may perceive how fit men these Apologists be to
challenge all Protestants unto disputation. But we leave the examples of
strangers, and come, at our Adversaries call, unto the examination of the
judgment of ancient Fathers. (...)

Whether, in the question of single life, the judgment of some Fathers be not
justly taxable.
SECT. 3.
6 Their own learned Cardinal Caietan requires attention, teaching us, that
See confessed above, lib. 1. cap 2. sect. 38. c.
Christ never prescribed any vow to a man for the obtaining of perfection: and
it is somewhat obserueable which their Cardinal And Cardinal Bella^mine, cum
scriberentur Scripturae sanctae, nondum coe^erat vsus vouedi Sanctis. Lib 3 de
cultu Sanct. c. 9.. Praeter^ a nom^.
Bellarmine affirms, viz. Whilst the Scriptures were in writing, the use of
vows was not begun. Which is a sufficient proof of the no-necessitie of
vowing. After this we find that the age next abutting upon the Apostles time,
did practice a perpetual vow of virginity; which being guarded with a just
moderation, may be judged both commendable and convenient. Neither does P.
Martyr (as the Apolog. page 9 not^ (.)
Apologists do in their text cunningly suggest) say, that Epiphantus and many
other Fathers erred therein, that is, in admitting of a profession of vows;
but (as in their See the testimony of P Martyr, note ()
margent his testimony does expressly declare,) As P. Martyr find in the same
place, let ^.

Adversaries conclusions.

7 Some Fathers (we confess) seem to exceed a mean, in so extolling
virginity, that thereby they debase wedlock too much, a state by Gods
ordinance (...) 13.
honorable: which is (as P. Martyr complains) Apolog. page 9. lit (a) and
(f), (...) should have added out of the Centurie, Facile ex Ignatio iudicari
possit, noluisse ^um laqueos con^ci entijs injic^ie. And of Scultetus, Sed
p^etas istius aetatis spontanea, and ita vt suo coniugio laus integra maneat
salua.
paulo impensius virginitatis studium venerars; and therefore is he noted of
these Apologists as one derogating from the ancient truth.

8 This is their ordinary manner of challenge, which proceeds from an
unpardonable ignorance in them; because they might have learned from their own
Doctors, that some Fathers did err herein: and therefore does their
Tertullianus defendit Montam er^orem, nuptias secun^^s damnar in libro qui
inscribitus, Monogamia. Alphonsus de coelibatu, part. 2. cap. 8. of whom S.
Hierome says: Tertullianus specialiter aduersus Ecclesiam texuit volumina de

See hereafter, lib. 5. cap. 9. sect. 1* Rhenanus in Arg. Tert. de exhort, ad

Apol. lib. aduers^s Iouin.
Romanists reprehend S. Hierome, as too rigorous against wedlock; another has
already taxed S. Gregory for a (...), that is, one too much hating the state
of marriage.

9 By this we may perceive, that these obiectors have been more zealous in
defending the persons of ancient men, then of acknowledging a discernable
truth, avouched by Protestants, and now partly confessed by our Adversaries
themselves. viz. that some Fathers have too much magnified virginity, and
therefore should their opinions be rectified by S. Augustine his moderation,
who conceived a personal case, Augustious non audet anteponere virginitatem
Iohannis coniugio Abrahae. Erasmus in August. cap. 21. de (...) coni^g.
wherein (as their Author says) he durst not prefer virginity before
wedlock. o Gregorius Magnus erat (...). See (...) lib. 1. cap. 2.. 33 etc.


10 Thus have we warranted the censure of Protestants, concerning the
incommodious speeches of some Fathers. We approach near to the justification of
their cause, and show

How much the now Romish Religion dissenteth from the purer Antiquity of the
primitive Church in the question of Vows; by proofs out of our Adversaries
confessions, concerning two points.
SECT. 4.
11 When we compare differences of times, as now and then, the first
discordance appears to be in respect of the age of Votaries: for whereas the
1. Tim. 5. 9 A widow not under 60 years.
Apostle required in his widows the age of threescore years, and aftertimes
would not admit Conc. Carthag. 3. Non ante an. 25. virgins co^secrentur. Can.

vetled Nuns till forty: their late Bellar. lib. 2. d^ M^nach. cap. 35.
Council allows boys, and girls to vow at the age of sixteen: which we
account to be an alteration of discretion into indiscretion.

12 The second difference is their doctrine of presumption, persuading ^tiamsi
non omnes habent potentiam pro^^mam, habent tamen remota, and possu^^, si
velint, precibus impetrare pot^tiam proxima^, id est, vires ad con^inendum.
Bellar. li. 2. de Monach ca. 31.. Illud autem. He expounds Desiderium
efficax: to be, efficax deside^ium continendi. Ibid. So does also Maldonat.
Ies. Com. in Matthew. 19. 11.
every one to be capable of the gift of continency, who will but seriously pray
for it. As though their wisdoms could prescribe better remedy 1. Cor. 7. 2.
for avoiding of fornication, then that which the holy Ghost has provided,
viz. Let every one have his own wife. In which respect we have it confessed,
that Hieronymi soror institutum Virginis a^^ipuit, -- sed multum and hoc
dissimile ab haru^ co^d^tione, quas hod^ ferreis cancellis, seu feras indomitas

S. Hieroms virgins differed from the virgins of these times, whose best
restraints of virginity are bars and walls. So little confidence, it
seems, they have in their pretended remedies.

13 And whereas we find diverse Ancients to consult immediately with the Oracle
of God, where it is written thus; [ Matthew. 19 11. [Non omnes capiunt verbum
hoc.] id est, Non omnes praestare possunt, vt sint sine vxore, quia carent dono
continentiae.
All men receive not this saying:] and hence concluding (as our learned
Adversary and Sic fere omnes exponunt: -- quam interpretationem adduci non
possum vt sequar, Maldonat. Ies. Com. in Matthew. 19. Amongst these Almost all,
are Origin, Gregory Nazianzene, Ambrose, by name specified of him.
Jesuit confesses) that almost all that comment upon this place of Scripture
do note, that all men are not capable of the state of single life, because they
have not the gift of continency: hereunto he vouchsafes only this answer: But
I (says he) do not agree thereunto. Such is the partial practice of our
Adversaries in condemning Protestants of impudency, for refusing the
testimonies, although but of a few; and yet will he have it held a point of
learning and wisdom in themselves, to reject (as often as they list) almost all.

14 Which their opposition unto Fathers might seem more tolerable, if herein
they did not also cross and thwart the express and plain direction of the
Spirit of God in the Word, exhorting married parties, even now 1. Cor. 7. 4. To
the married I say, Defraud not one another, except it be with consent for a
time, that you may give your selves to fasting and prayer, that Satan tempt you
not by your incontinencie.
fasting and praying, to return unto the duty of marriage bed, intimating
thereby, that the act of wedlock is ordained and sanctified of God to avoid
Satan's temptation unto incontinencie; and that there is not sufficient virtue
in prayer and fasting, for subduing of Satan's force in all such like
temptations. Which doctrine of Protestants we have proved to be true in parties
unmarried, who have not received that special gift: confirming this by direct
Scripture, and the confessed suffrages of See (...) it the l^tter, ^.
almost all ancient Fathers; amongst whom we have cited by name, Origin,
Gregory Nazianzene, Ambrose; to whom we have adjoined the testimonies of S.

changing a cauti^n into a presumption.

17 And may not our Adversaries seem in a sort, to bewray a resemblance of
like distate, who impute unto marriage an inseparable impediment unto holy
Orders; because (as it is by them pretended, and has been (...) ^ap 2. ^4.
confuted) of the inherent pollution in the act of wedlock; by comparison of
the pollution of the old law? By which reason they may as well conclude, that a

read, that in the days of Domitian, Flaccus a man of great nobility, desired
to marry Petronilla the daughter of S. Peter. She must be supposed by course
of story to have been either three score years of age, and then no fit match
for a young man: or else to have been begotten after that S. Peter was an
Apostle: as Baronius (anno Christi 69. number 33. 39) observes; if the story
shall be supposed to be true.

19 Nor this only, but moreover all Christians enjoying the honor of
wedlock, must, by their former accusation, be likewise judged carnal and
fleshly: which we have proved in one degree to be the breath of ancient
heretics, who in pretense of sanctity, abhorring marriage, did but offer
poison in a golden cup. This therefore is a third difference, turning that act
into the reproach of pollution and filthiness, which God in his word has
sanctified, and graced with the term of undefiled. Next follows

A fourth aberration from Antiquity.
SECT. 6.
20 There is another point of doctrine, wherein antiquity has yielded us her
voice, saying from S. Augustine (as is confessed,) that Augustinus, Basilio
aequalis, permultis rationibus probauit, connubia post votum contracta non
debere d(...). Polyd. Virgil. lib. 7. Invent. cap. 2.
the marriage contracted after the vow may not be dissolved; and from a In
Concilio Neoca sa^^ensi, etc. See above lib 1. cap. 2. 35. And this is apparent
by the (...) in Su^^n^, T^m. 1. page 298. and page 278.
Council, rather punishing him who shall after his vow of continency commit
fornication, then him who shall contra^t himself in matrimony. The truth
hereof is Apostolical, as is plain in S. 1. Timoth. 5. 11.
Paul, exhorting that the young wanton widows should rather marry. And that
these were Votaries, it is held by the common consent of ancient Fathers, who
thereby teach in like case, that the marriage made after the vow of virginity,
ought not to be dissolved; Maluissem equidem viduas hasce a pactionibus cum
Christo initis minime desciuissent, sed cum nuptias malint, and ipse assentior,
dummodo iuniores sint quae nubere volunti est enim fatius matrem familias
fieri, qua ^^per domus alienas vagari, etc. Theophylan 1. Tim. 5.

21 Now what little affinity there is between this doctrine and the Romish,
may be known best by the language of their present School, wherein we find
three of their principal Jesuits contrariwise to affirm, concerning
Votarists, that Sacerdos si fornicetur, aut domi concubinam foueat, tametsi
graui sacrilegio se obstringat, grauius tamen peccat, si matrimonium contrahat.
Coster. Ies. Enchirid. cap. 15.
it is better in some respect for such daily to play the fornicator, and to
keep a Concubine, then after a vow, to be contracted in wedlock. (...)

(we see) there is contained a profession both of a sacramental truth, in the
outward bodily elements and actions, and also of a spiritual truth, in the
souls apprehension, and digestion of Christ's true body: but of the
sacramental and outward manner, the Si quis -- negauerit mirabilem illam --
conuersionem totius substa^tiae panis in corpus, and totius substantiae vini in
sanguinem, manentibus dunta^at speciebus panis and vini, (quam quidem
conuersionem Catholica Ecclesia aptissime Transubstantiationem appellat)
anathema sit. Council. Trid. Sess. 13. can. 2.
Roman Church has otherwise defined: By Transubstantiation is meant (says
their Council) a change of the very whole substance of the bread and wine into
the substance of the flesh and blood of Christ, so that no substance of bread
and wine does remain. This doctrine is held by the now Romish as an article of
faith, and for the denial of the same Transubstantiation of the bread and wine
into Christ's natural body and blood, much In the days of Queen Mary, as is
confessed by M. Parsons in the third part of his Three Conuersions, page 196.
blood has been shed: whether justly or unjustly, it comes to be examined by
the judgment of Antiquity, whereof we secondly enquire,

Whether the Apologists object from antiquity, testimonies of Fathera
pertinently, for proof of Transubstantiation.

SECT. 2.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Concerning the real presence of Christ's body in the Sacrament, it is
affirmed, that S. Humfred. Ies^itis. part. 2. rat. 5. page 626. post med.
Gregory taught Transubstantiation.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
3 The question of Transubstantiation being so often, and so vrgently debated
on both sides, lest that we might be thought to defraud our Christian Reader of
our best direction, we shall (God willing) reach him such a thread, whereby he
may be able to wind himself out of the Labyrinth of their perplexed disputes.
And first concerning the objected Fathers, they begin with S. Gregory: whose
testimony we have already proved to have been subtly conveyed, not taken
from any syllable of S. Gregory his own writings, but only out of the Romish
Legend, reporting how S. Transubstantiatione^, quando matrona quada^ audiente
panem quem suis manibus fecerat, a Gregorio corpus Domini^^ appellari, and
subridente, mox ad coarguendam and repellendam mu^ieris incredelitatem,

Gregory, for the conuincing of a woman's incredulity, turned the bread into
visible flesh: which story Doctor Humfrey does relate, and elsewhere Legatur

lib. 1. cap. 2.. 6. and it will make the answer for D. Humfrey more full.

lib. 1. cap. 2. S^ct. 6.
Adversaries censured it to be leaden, lying, and fabulous. As for S. Gregory's
doctrine concerning the Lords Supper, it, in the judgment of Protestants, was
thought to be See above lib. 1. cap. 2.. 2.
sound: and finally Transubstantiation, the confessed See ibid.. 7.
new article of the Romish faith, was proved to be crosly repugnant unto the
argument wherewith S. Gregory confounded an heretic. Thus much of their first
instance taken from S. Gregory: how little help they may hope for from other
Fathers, we will not divine, but demonstrate. See above lib. 1. cap. 2.. 8.
number. 13.


THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
It is affirmed, that The Centurie writers, Cent. 5. col. 517. l. 23. say:
Chrysost^^^^ transubstantiationem videtur confirmare, nam ita scribit, etc.
Chrysostom is thought to confirm Transubstantiation.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 3.
4 Our Centurists say, Videtur Chrysostomus, that is, Chrysostom seems to
confirm Transubstantiation: which the Apologists translate [Chrysostome is
thought.] Now from but a seeming confirmation to infer a judicial
persuasion, is a strain more violent then which either the purpose of our For
the Centurists use the same videtur often, but doubtfully, as may appear
through their whole Centuries* for when they note the opinion it self, then
they say, Asterit, affirmat, tenet, vendicat, etc.
Centurists, or the nature of the word can enforce, as any one may perceive by
every thing, which seems to be that which it is not: but much more by the
place of S. Chrysostom, who says, Nu^ vides panem? number vinu^? number sicut
reliqui cibi in secessum vadunt? absit* ne sic cogites, quemadmodum s^ceta igni
adhibita illi assimilatur, nihil substantiae remanet, nihil superfluit; sic and
hic puta mysteria consumi corporis substantia: propter quod and accedentes ne
putetis, quod accipiatis diuinum corpus ex homine, sed ex ipsis Seraphim
forcipe ignem, quem scil. Esaias vidit, vos accipere. Centur. 5. page 518.
Think not that thou see bread or wine, which as other meats go into the
draught, etc. These are the words which may seem to confirm
Transubstantiation: but let us see what follows; Think not that thou
receiuest these from man (meaning the Minister) but from Seraphins. This
shows that S. Chrysostom seems no more to teach that the proper nature of
bread was changed into Christ's body, then that the Minister, Man, is changed
into a Seraphin, which is a spirit. And seeing no Adversary will say, that he
understood Transubstantiation of a man into a Seraphin: we may be instructed,
that such kind of speeches are not used of Fathers in a proper and strict
sense, but only in a seeming resemblance; as the sequel of this discourse
will more plainly demonstrate, after that we have yielded answers unto the
particular objections: whereof the third follows.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
It is affirmed, that Centur. 4. c. 10. col. 985. line 30.
Eusebius Emissen did speak unprofitably of Transubstantiation.

there says, that Cyrillus l. 10. in Ioh. cap. 13. [Non negamus recta^ nos side

^oniunctionis ratione^ secund^m carnem cu^ illo esse, profect^ perriegamus;
idque a^ diuinis scri^ t^^ is omnino alienu^ dicimus.] Dicit P. Martyr, loqui
Cyrillu^ de coniunctione corporali, quae nobis est cum Christo per
incarnationem, quia natura nostr^ in Christo est. Audi vero quomodo Cyrillus se
exponat, is enim paulo infra exponens quid sit illa coniuntio, sic ait: [An
^ortassis putat ignotam nobis mysticae benedictionis virtutem esse? quae cum in
nobis sit, nor ne corporali^er quoque facit communicatione carnis* Christ's,
Christu^ in nobis habitare^] Et infra, [Vnde conside andum est, non habitudine

fidem praebe.] Similia fuse repetir, lib. 11. cap. 26. Bellar. lib. 2. de
Euchar. cap. 25.. Verum falsam. and. Et quia.
by the mystical blessing in this Sacrament we have a conjunction with Christ
according to the flesh, and that Christ hereby, by the communication of his
flesh, dwells bodily in us, not only by affection of love, but even by a
natural participation, without which the corruptible nature of our bodies can
never be capable of immortality and incorruption: whether (we say) he
understands (as Peter Martyr conceived) a corporal conjunction which the
faithful have with Christ by his incarnation, wherein Christ is become a
natural man, and through the hypostaticall union of his godhead will raise all
natural men, who are ingrafted and incorporated into him as members of his
body, out of corruption unto glory and immortality; which conjunction in this
Sacrament is ratified unto the faithful communicants: or whether (as the
Romanists teach) thereby be meant an orall and corporal eating of his natural
body, we are referred by Cardinal Bellarmine to have it determined by Cyrill
himself, unto whose sentence we jointly appeal.

12 Let us peruse his testimony, as it is in it self expressed, and not as it
is sophistically distracted by their Bellarmine breaks off at [Habitare?]
concealing the words, which immediately follow, and are a perfect commentary of
the precedent sentence: for it follows:
Cardinal. First he says, that Christ by this communion of his body does
corporally dwell in us: but he adds the reason of his speech, that for this
cause Cut enim membra fidelium membra sunt Christi? Nescitis (inquit Paulus)
quia membra vestra membra sunt Christi^ membra igitur Christi meretricis faciam
membra? Then come in the next words of Bellarmines petition, Vnde considerandum
etc. And yet again he makes another abru^^ion, dissembling these words; Nam
quem admodum si quis igno liquefactam ceram. alij cerae simil^er liquefactae
miscuerit, vt voum quid or vtrisque factum vide (...); sic commomone co^poris
and sanguinis Christi, ipse in nobis est, and nos in ipso. Then follows, Non
poterat euim, etc.
the members of the faithful are called the members of Christ. Showing that
only the faithful have this corporal union with Christ, and therefore cannot
understand by the word corporally, a corporal manner of eating, which the
wicked and reprobate (who Vt ^legma, pituita, etc. viuentis hominis nequ^
membra sunt neque parts, and tamen non sunt extra corpus; ita impij ad
super^^^os humores referuntur, qui suo tempore vbi maturi sunt, cum stercoribus
egeruntur. Coster^^ Ies. Apolog. part. 3. cap. 12.. Et Hugo.
are not the true members of Christ) may as well perform as any faithful
sanctified child of God.

13 Secondly, through the union spoken of by Cyrill, Christ is said to dwell
corporally in the faithful communicants. But our When the external forms and
accidents of bread and wine are corrupted, there remains no longer the
substance of Christ's body M. Parsons in the Re^^ew, page 199. and Bellarmine.
See hereafter.
Romanists imagine that the body of Christ presently departs, as soon as
the forms of bread and wine begin to be corrupted.

14 Thirdly, Cyrill shows, that the manner and nature of union of Christ with
us, is no other then is the Vt igitur inter nos and Deum singulos vniret,
quamuis corpore simul and anima distemus, mod^m tamen adinuenit consitio (...),
and lapie^tiae suae congr^entem isuo enim corpore credentes per communionem
mysticam benedicens, and secum and inter nos vnum nos corpus effecit: quis enim
eos, qui vnius sancta corporis v^ione in vno Christo vni^ sunt,
union of Christians among themselves, who (as for example Paul and Peter)
although they be divided in respect of place, yet, because of their mystical
union with Christ, they are one body: by reason of which analogicall
conjunction of head with members, and of members one with another, Cyrill
calls (even according to our adversaries construction) our communicating with
Christ, ab hac (...) ali v^ione alienos pu^abit^^^ fi omnes v^^m pane^
manducamus, omnes vnum corpus efficimur. Cyril. lib. 11. in Ioh. c. 26. And
aga^^^, Consider and si est, si ad vnionem consensus and voluntatis natu^^l^^
etiam iuenire poslumus, per quam nos inter nos, and omnes Deo colligemur:
fortassis enim ^tiam
a natural union: as he calls the conjunction which by Christ the Corpo^ali
union coniungimur, licet adeo dissipati simus, vt vousquisque seorsim and
subsistat and circumscribatur: nam si Petrus and Paulus vnum vnitate in Christo
sint, Petrus tamen Paulus non est. Cyril. ibid.
faithful have among themselves, a corporal union; which no Romanist, we
think, will expound of any natural or corporal manner of conjunction, in a
literal, but only mystical and spiritual respect had unto the effect
thereof; namely, that by the interest we have in Christ through his Humanity
crucified for us, all the faithful by his bodily death are redeemed from hell,
and by the virtue of his bodily resurrection shall be raised in their bodies
unto heavenly tabernacles of eternal blessedness.

15 Moreover then, these phrases used by Cyrill, viz. Christ dwelling bodily in
us, and Christians united naturally and corporally in themselves, being in
their literal acception so absurd, that their own late Cardinal, and
sometime ^esuite, Perpede qualem vnionem (speaking of Cyril) hic Doctor
confueatur. -- Quanquam (meaning Hilary and Cyril) hi Doctores non sunt
intelligendi, vt velint ex Christo sumpto and sumente vnum ficri ens natural;
indigna enim est illis doctrina haec: sed hoc dicere voluerunt, praeter
vnionem, quae vnion^ charitatis and fidei fit, ^desse etiam intra nos ipsos
vere and realiter Christum ipsum, qui causa est sidei eiusdem. Tollet Ies.
coman Io^. 6. Annot. 29. To the objected places out of Hilary, lib. 8. de
Trin^t. and out of Cyril, lib. 10. in Ioh. cap. 13. yet are these places of
Cyril objected most peremptorily by Card. Bellarmine, writing thus: De
Sacramento Euchar^stiae tam proprie and perspicue loquitur, vt magis aperte
loqui non potuerit. Bellar. lib. 2 de Euchar. cap. 13.
Tollet, does judge the literal sense of them unworthy of the name of Cyrill,
or Hilary: our Adversaries are compellable to suffer us to interpret such
sentences according to a spiritual sense. Finally, in all these sentences of
Cyrill, expressing only the incorporation of Christ with us, there is no one
syllable objected betokening the Transubstantiation of the bread into Christ.
By this time we discern the emptiness and vanity of their third instance:
now they fly unto S. Cyprian.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
It is affirmed, that In the treatile attributed to Vrsinus, entitled
Commonetactio cuiusdam theologi. de sacra coena, and eiusdem commonefactionis
consideratio, page 211. and 218.
in Cyprian are many things which seem to affirm Transubstantiation: in so
much as they do The Sermon of Cyprian de Coena Domini, which this foresaid
testimony concerns, is dedicated to Cornelius who was Bishop of Rome when
Cyprian lived, and to whom Cyprian himself, l. 1. ep. 1 and ep. 3. did write;
insomuch that M. Fulke against the Rhemish Testament, in 1. Cor. cap 11. fol.
282 a. circa medium, alleges testimonies from thence, affirming that the
Auth^r de Coena Domini was not in time much inferior to Cyprian.
unworthily affirm that Sermon of his, in which those sayings are extant, to
be counterfeit.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 7.
16 It may be these obiectors will esteem the judgment of Protestants herein
of better worth, when they shall perceive their own worthiest Cardinal Extat
Inter opera Cypriani Sermo de Coena Domini, qui eisi Cypriani Carthaginensis
esse non videatur; tamen est omnino antiqui alicuius. Bellar. lib. 2. de
Euchar. cap. 9.
to doubt whether this be the Sermon of Cyprian, or else of some ancient
Author: which gives us cause at least to suspect it for a counterfeit.
Nevertheless if we (for disputation sake) shall admit this his petition, to
think that it is the work of an Author very ancient: yet cannot our
Apologists prove from Vrsinus any more then a seeming affirmation of
Transubstantiation. But this has been the usual guise of these Apologists,
wheresoever they find in our Authors the word [videtur,] that is, it seems,
presently to apprehend thereby a confessed affirmation. But how vnconsonant and
unconscionable a collectio^ this is, they will better discern, if they shall
but look in a glass which their own Cardinal Bellarmine does set before us,
saying, that Atque hinc discimus. non esse mirandum si Augustinus, Theodorerus,
and alijveteres quaedam dixerint quae in speciem videantur ^^uere Hae^etic^^,
cum etiam lodoco (a Rom^nist) quaedam exciderint, quae ab aduerfarijs trahantur
ad suam causam. Bellar. lib. 2 de Euchar. ca. 25. Hic vero.
Augustine, Theodores, and other ancients have said some things, which
(speaking of this question of Transubstantiation) may seem in show to favor
(thus he calls Protestants) the heretics. If now we should take the liberty
practiced by these Apologists, might we not hereupon conclude as from a
confession of Cardinal Bellarmine, that Augustine, Theodoret, and other
ancients have favored the doctrine of Protestants, and confuted the Romish
Article of Transubstantiation? But we owe justice even to our Adversaries, and
therefore may not wrest their words, and peruett their meanings. Let us return
unto S. Cyprian.

17 The testimony of their imagined Panis iste, quem Dominus discipulis
porrigebat, non effigy, sed nature mutatus, omnipotentia verbi factus est
ca^o: and ficut in persona Christi humanitas vi sebatur, and latebat diuinitas,
ita Sacramento visibili ineffabiliter diuina se effudit essentia: vt esset
religioni circa Sacramenta deuotio, and ad veritatem, cuius corpus and sanguis
Sacramenta sunt, sincerior pateret aditus, vsque ad participationem spiritus,
non vsque ad consubstantialitatem Christi. Cyprian. erm. de Coena D^m. Nullo
modo mysterijs diuina se absentat ma^estas. Ibid. Non dentes ad mordendum
acuimus, sed fide sincera panem sanctum frangimus and partimur: dum quod diumum
and quod humanum est distinguimus and separamus, itemque simulseparata
iungentes, vnum Deum and hominem fatemur. Idem, de Coena Dom. where he means
only a change of the property, that whereas the essential property of bread
is for the murishment corp^rall, now it is by Christ^ ordinance d^s^^nated for
a spiritual food by faith: therefore a little before he says, Panis est esca,
sanguis vita, caro substantia, corpus Ecclesia, corpus propter membrorum in
vnum conuenientiam, panis propter nutrimenti congruentiam, sanguis propter
viuificationis efficientiam, caro propter assumpte humanitatis proprietatem.
Item:
Cyprian, which proves no more that the bread is changed into flesh, then it
proves that (for it is the same Authors comparison) Christ's humanity is
changed into his Divinity: which without heresy, cannot be directly affirmed.

18 If they shall still persist in the seeming shows of words, then must they
be admonished to construe the meaning of these words of that Cyprian; P^n^^iste
communis, in carnem and sang^^^em mutatus, procurat vitam and incrementum
corpo^ibus, ideoque e^ consueto effectu fidei nostrae ad^^ta infirmitas,
sensibili argumento edocta est visibilibus Sacramentis inesle vitae aeternae
effectum, and non tan^ co^porali quam spirituali transitione nos cum Christo
vn^^i Cyprian. ibid.
This consecrated bread (says he) gives life and increase unto our bodies.
Which kind of speech, even in the judgment of their own See hereafter 17.
lit. 2.
Cardinal, cannot be literally understood without absurdity; and therefore
may instruct our Apologists to read such like sacramental phrases of ancient
Fathers, at least, cum grano salis, with a grain of reasonable salt of better
discretion, then hitherto they have done. Their next refuge is unto Theodoret.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
That lastly Ignatius M. Whitgift in his defense against Cartwrights Reply,
page 408. ante med.
who was S. John's scholar, and lived in Christ's time, did (as Theodores 1200.
years since, and themselves now do Theodoret. dial. 3 and Ha melmanus

in proof of their Real presence, say of the heretics in his time, They do
not admit Eucharist and oblations, because they do not confess the Eucharist
to be the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sin.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 8.
19 In this place Protestants may seem to be somewhat beholden unto these
Apologists, by whom they are ranked with such heretics, who in the days of S.
John were condemned by his Scholar Ignatius: for thus the opinion of
Protestants may be thought to be ve^ie ancient. But their Cardinal Quae
sententia Ignatij citatur a Theodoreto in 3. Dialog. ex epistola ad Smyrnenses,
vbi tamen nunc non habetur. Ne glorientur aute^ Caluinistae, sententiam suam
valde antiquam esse, obscruandum est illos haereticos (de quibus Theodoretus
loquitur) non tam Sacramentum Eucharistiae, qua^ mysterium incarnationis
oppugnasse. Bellar. lib. 1. d^ E^^har. cap. 1.
Bellarmine does envy them so much grace, saying, Lest that the Protestants
should boast of so great antiquity, we must observe (says he) that those
heretics, whom I heodoret mentions, did not so much speak of the Sacrament
of the Eucharist, as of the mystery of Christ's incarnation. Here another
cunning of the Romanists bewraieth it self. For the Apologists contend to
prove the doctrine of Protestants, in this point, to have been noted by
Theodoret, that thereby they may be made akin unto old heretics: which
accusation their own Cardinal Bellarmine will not allow, lest that this
opinion may take upon it the name of ancient.

20 Again, the purpose of the Apologists was, hereby to prove their
Transubstantiation in the Eucharist: but their Cardinal does answer, that the
sentence concerns the mystery of Christ's incarnation. So that the judgment
of the Apologizers may seem still to lose in weight, the rather because
Theodoret (as b will be now proved) was a resolute and professed adversary
unto their Transubstantiated manner of presence.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And one of our Adversaries confesses accordingly, that Adamus Francisci in
Margarita Theologica, pa. 256. says, Comment^^ Patistarum de
Transubstantiatione mature in Ecclesi^m irr^psit.
Transubstantiation entered early into the Church: and another says Anthony de
Ad^mo in his Anatomy of the Mass, page 236. a. ante medium.
I have not yet hitherto been able to know, when this opinion of the Real and
bodily being of Christ in the Sacrament did begin.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 9.
21 That the opinion of Transubstantiation, was (but not in the Fathers) very
ancient, we cannot but confess; for we find that Theodoret makes his
Eranistes, an heretical party, to bolt it our, whom he therefore
orthodoxally, and (that I may so say) Protestantly confuteth, yet as being then
only a private opinion; which (as our objected Author said truly) irrepsit,
signifying, that it was yet but a creeper. For not till a thousand years
after, it came to that growth, as from an opinion to wax so big as a doctrine
of faith, and of a private to become general.

22 Thus have we answered their particular objections, wherein they have
imposed upon us a credulity of an imagined Gregory, a forged Eusebius
Emissenus, a counterfeit Cyprian, besides the seeming testimony of
Chrysostom, the impertinent sentence of Ambrose, the perverted sense of
Theodoret. Notwithstanding we do not marvel hereat, knowing that forged
doctrines must need the support of feined suffragies. It now remains after
that we have warded off their violence, we should try our force in reply, and
show, That the Romanists are constrained to reject some testimonies of
antiquity, as contradictorie to their doctrine of Transubstantiation. (...)

The sentence of Tertullian.
SECT. 12.
31 Tertullian lived 1400 years since, and expounded these words [hoc est
corpus meum, i. this is my body,] that by Acceptum panem and distributum
Discipulis suis Christus corpus suum secit, dicendo, [Hoc est corpus meum,] id
est, figura corporis, etc. Tert-idu^rsus Marcion. lib 4. cap. 40.
body is meant a figure of his body, and is therefore noted by one of our
Adversaries to have fallen into that Error, putantium corpus Christi in
Eucharistia tantum esse sub figura, iam olim condemnatus est, viz. in
Berengario. Author Admonitionis ad Lectorem de quibusdam Tert. dogmatis, ante

error, which afterward was condemned, meaning in Berengarius. Another
answers, that Hoc est corpus, ad est figura; which interpretation is not
according to the true sense of Christ's words, although his meaning swerve not
from the truth. Harding in Iuel. Art. 12.. Thus the.

The testimonies of S. Chrysostom and Bertram: with a note of a notable shift
used by the Romanists in answering unto Fathers.
SECT. 13.
32 S. Chrysostom ^ying the nature of the bread, says, that Si haec ra^a
sanctificata in priuatos vsus transfer periculosum est, in quibus no^ veru^

the true body of Christ is not contained (meaning corporally) in these

is fraught with many errors: among which this now in question, Bellarmine
uses, saying, Verba illa ab aliquo Berengarij discipulo in^e^ta v^ lentur, ^^
very s^allo^,
was (say they) inserted by some disciple of Berengarius. But both these are
raw answers, because this latter of insertion, is but a conjecture, and by the

Manuscripts may be proved to be false: the former is impertinent, except they
can name some ancient heretic, who maintained the Protestants ground; which,
their Cardinal See above sect. 8.
Bellarmine says, is not to be found.

33 But we have no reason to expect any satisfiable answers from our
Adversaries, who (as is evident in the original copy of their Index Expurg.)
do profess an art of deluding their Readers, saying, that it is convenient for
them Quanquam librum istum Bertrami Presbyteri, de corpore and sanguine

above seven hundred years since, called in question the Romish manner of
Christ's presence in the Sacrament. It is notable to see how well they have
practiced their artificial shift upon this Author, commanding his word [ Fol.
1137. Legendum [Inuisibiliter] pro, visibiliter. Et infra verse. 36. [Secundum
creaturarum substantiam, quod prius fueru^t ante consecrationem: hoc and postea

inuisible] to be blotted out, and in stead thereof to put in visible: and
expounding these words [substance of creatures] to signify only external
colors, or outward accidents. And can we think that these new deuisers can be
sincere obiectors, or competent answerers in questions which may concern the
doctrine of antiquity?

34 This might peradventure be thought possible, but that we find them so far
fallen forth with some ancient witnesses, that a principal Minime mirum est,
si vnus aut alter, aut etiam aliqui ex veteribu^ minus considerate h^c de re
senserint and scripserint maxim cum non tractarent ex instituto ipsam
quaestionem. This he calls, Breue and simplex, and sine vllo incommodo
responsum. Greg. de Valent. Ies. de Transubsi. lib. 2. cap. 7.. Quod si.
Jesuit pronounces, that it is an answer (as he calls it) brief, and
simple, and no way inconvenient, to say, that it is not to be marvelled that
some ancients have both thought and writ less considerately concerning
Transubstantiation. How inconsiderate therefore have our Apologists been in
this part of their challenge, wherein (by so many exceptions taken against
antiquity by their own men) they are catched in their own snare, and are
become irreconcilably adversaries to their own cause?

35 This question of Transubstantiation being of so great consequence, that if
it be defensible, Protestants must stand chargeable of heresy; but if it may
be confuted, the Romanists must necessarily be condemned of Idolatry: we think
it our bounden duty to consult more exactly with the Senate of antiquity, and
to make evident

How every one may easily learn to understand the direct meaning of ancient
Fathers, in such testimonies, whereby our Adversaries do delude men in the
confirmation of Transubstantiation, the now Article of Romish faith.
SECT. 14.
36 We can never rightly apprehend men's conceits, before we truly learn their
language: for if we catch only at the syllables of the Fathers sentences, and
do not directly understand the Idiome and propriety of their speech, but dwell
upon the sound, and not upon the sense thereof; how shall we, children know our
Fathers doctrines? how shall we not by our ignorance of their tongues build up
some towers of Babilonish and confused conceits, such as we take the Romish
Article of Transubstantiation to be? Wherefore we must first endeavor to learn
distinctly the signification of our Fathers voices, which any Reader, although
but of mean capacity, may easily apprehend by that which shall be delivered.
Now then

The first argument, of discerning of the language of ancient Fathers in the
question of this Sacrament, is taken from the analogy or like tenor of speech
used by them in the Sacrament of Baptism.
SECT. 15.
37 Our M. Parsons in his third part of three Conuers. in the Reuiew, ca. 2.
and Bellar. lib. 1. and 2. de Euchar. Greg. de Valent. Ies. in libris de reali
praesentia.
Adversaries catch at the words of Fathers concerning the Eucharist, especially
where they find any terms specifying, 1. that it is not to be looked upon as
bare bread and wine, 2. that it is changed into another thing or nature not
seen, 3. that the working of grace therein is ineffable: 4. that herein there
is a miraculous operation: 5. that Christ's blood is said to be in this
Sacrament, and we hereby to eat his flesh: 6 that the matter is to be
worshipped. By every which kind of observation they use to underprop their
imagined Transubstantiation, not suffering (alas) their Reader to understand,
that the same Fathers use the same speeches concerning the Sacrament of
Baptism: wherein both they and we know and profess, that the water after
consecration continues in the same substance of water. Unto the which we
parallele the speeches of the Fathers concerning the Eucharist in every kind
of term.

38 For first, S. Cyrill says thus: Cyril. Hierosol. i^ objected for
Transubstantiation, for saying, Non consideres panem nudum, a^t vinum nudu^:
not denying them to be nuda, naked in nature, but in use. Mystag. 4. For he
says the like of Baptism: Non tanquam aquae s^^pli^^ studeas huic ^auacro,
sed vt spirituali gratiae, quae cum aqua datur. Ide^ Cateches. 3. And of holy
oil, Sed vide ne suspiceris illud vnguentum nudu^ esse: quemadmod^ enim panis
in Eucharistia per inuocationem Spiritus sancti non est deinceps nudus aut
simplex panis, sed corpus Christi, sic and hoc sanctum vnguentum non est postea
nudum, neque vt quis die at commune propter inuocationem, sed Christi donum
praesentia Spiritus sancti. Cyrill. Cateches. 3. p. 23. As also.
Do not look upon this lauer of Baptism, as upon bare water. Gregory Nyssen.
Ne contemnas diuinum lauacrum, neque id tanquam commune propter vsum aquae
parui facias Greg. Nyssen. de Baptis. And,
Gregory Nyssene thus: Contemn not this water, as though it were common.
Chrysostom. Aqua primatum tenet in elementis: sed cum aquae elementum acceperit
Spiritum sanctum, fit Sacramentum, and iam non erit aqua potationis, sed
sanctificationis; non erit aqua communis, sed re^ectionis. Chrys^st. in Psalm.
22 vt resert Coccius (and vere) lib. 5. de Bapt. page 529.
Chrysostom thus: It is no more the common water of refreshing the body, but
of sanctification of the soul. All showing that if man look upon this water
with a natural eye, he shall find only natural water: but if he behold it
with a spiritual eye, as it is by the ordinance of God a seal of faith, he in
this natural shall discern a spiritual effect of grace.

39 Secondly, the Fathers note in Baptism a certain change. Ambrose (who is
Ambros Fort^ dices, meus panis est vsitatus: sed panis iste ante verba
Sacramentorum, panis est, vbi accesserit consecratio, de pane fit caro Christi.
De Sacram. lib. 4. cap. 4. whereupon Bellarmine thus: Quid potuit clarius? And
yet Ambrose says also of the elements, Operatorius sermo est vt sint quae
crant, and in aliud commutentur, or else operentur. But to be the same they
were, takes away transubstantiation into another nature, yet changed into the
use to be instruments of grace by faith, as his own similitud^ does
illustrate: Tu ipse eras vetus creatura, postquam consecratus es, noua creatura
esse coepisti: accipe igitur quemadmodum sermo Christi omne^ creatura^ mutare
confueuerit.
objected in the like, for proof of Transubstantiation in the Eucharist)
speaking of the water of Baptism, And adds of the water of Baptism: Nature
mutari per benedictionem. Lib. 4. de Sacram. and lib. de ijs qui initiantur
mysterij^. cap. 9.
says likewise, The nature is changed by benediction. And Cyrill Alex.
Spiritus sancti operatione ad diuinam aquae reformantur naturam, qua baptizati
corpus abstergun^. ^^b. 2. in Ioh. c 42. Basilea 1546.
Cyrill Alex. The waters of Baptism are by operation of the holy Ghost changed
into a divine nature. And Oculis intellectus ista percipiamus, nihil enim
sensibile nobis tradidit Christu^, sic in Baptismo, etc. Chrysostom. in Matthew.
hom. 83.
Chrysostom (speaking both of the Eucharist, and of Baptism,) Let us behold
those things with the eye of understanding, for in these no sensible matter is
delivered unto us. And yet we see the outward elements of water remain
sensibly the same. Therefore this alteration of nature and sense does signify
only the spiritual effects: as may appear more plainly by their term of
ineffable, which is the third point.

40 To this purpose writes Gregory Corpori quidem quod apparet, aqua est, quae
sub sensum cadit; animae vero, quae visum fugit, spiritus qui non apparet, and
ineffabiliter accedit. Orat. de S. Baptism. And S. Ambros. lib. de ijs qui in
baptism initiantur.
Nyssen, That which appears to the bodily eye is water, and is seen; but
unto the soul, which cannot be seen, the invisible spirit of God has access
after a manner ineffable, that is, which cannot be expressed. Which is the
ordinary phrase of all Fathers, expounded by Venerable Panis and vi^i creatur
a in Sacrame (...) and sanguinis Christi ineffabili Spiritus sanctificatione
(...). Beda in oct^^. Epiphan. cit^d by Bishop I^el, Art. 10.
Bid, to be meant of a sacramental change of elements, in their spiritual
effect of sanctification wrought thereby. Which will be more discernable by the
fourth note, concerning operation miraculous.

41 Hereunto makes that saying of Epiphan. Fortis facta est i^ Christo vi^tus
panis, and fortitudo aqu^, vt ^^ panis nobis fi^^ vir^^^, sed virtus ipsius
panis. and cibus quidem est panis, etc. distinguishing (...), and virtutem
panis in the Eucharist, as aquam and virtutem aquae in Baptism. Tom. 2. lib 3.
A^^^^phala^^i, (...) 1578.
Epiphanius, wherein he acknowledges, that there is to be observed the like
virtue in the water of Baptism, as there is in the bread of the Eucharist: and
Gregory Greg. Nyss^^. lib. de (...) quomodo Baptisma sit regenecationis caus^,
exempla add^cit earum (...) pet. quas Deus facit (...) acu^^, vt ^^^gam
A^^oni^, and ^li^, [(...) (inquit) cum materiae sint inanimatae, atque sensus

modum (...) que (...) causa hominis effectrix est. Audi igitu^ a nobi^ quod
aqua, quae benedici^^^, purgat atque i^^^minat hominem.
Nyssene, expressing how Baptism works our regeneration, does illustrate it
by examples of those things (says Cardinal Vt refert Bellarm. lib. 2. de
effect. Sacram c. 6.. Gregorius.
Bellarmine) by which God wrought miracles. In like manner Leo: Christus dedit
aquae, quod dedit matris virtus enim altissimi, and obsi b^atio Spiritus
sancti, quae fecit vt Maria pareret Saluatorem, eadem facit vt regener^^ ^nda
credentem. Leo de Natiui^. Sermon. 4. Deus mirabile nobis Sacramentum
regenerationis indulsit. Leo epist. 13.
Pope Leo, Christ gave that virtue to the water, which he gave to his own
Mother: as she brought forth a Saniour, so does this water a believer. For
which effect sake (which is our regeneration) he calls it a marvelous
Sacrament. And S. Ambros. Non agnosco vsum naturae, nullus est hic naturae
ordo, vbi est excellentia gratiae. Ambros. de illu qui initiantur myster. cap 9.
Ambrose refuses to acknowledge herein any use of nature, where grace is
predominant: the manner whereof Cyprian calls Docet Cyprianus hoc fieri mirum
in modum. Bellar. lib. 2. de effect. Sacram. cap. 9.
marvelous: which also seems so marvelous unto Chrysostomus: Nullo pacto de
intellectuali per Baptismum regeneratione, and admirabili partu rationem
reddemus. Nam and Angeli qui fuerunt tam inenarrabilis operis mod^ minime
possun^ enatr^^^ (...) and viderunt, (...) sed tantium Paces, (...), and
Spiritus sanctus. Chrysostom. hom. 24. in Ioh.
Chrysostom, that the Angels cannot possibly express it: wherein, as
Sanctificatae hae aquae vim sanctificandi comb^^un^. -- Igitur medicatis
quodammodo his aquis per Angeli interuentum, and spirit^^ in aquis corporanter
(...), and (...) vt refers Cocci^s lib. 5. de Baptis. page 494.
Tertullian speaks) by the intercourse and ministry of Angels, man's soul is
corporally washed, and his body is spiritually purged: and again their (...),

6. (...) de Baptis. vt refert Iuell^s, Art. 6.
Emissenus; Let those that thirst for the glory of the resurrection, now
refresh their faith (speaking of Baptism the Sacrament of forgiveness of
sins, and of resurrection from death,) of remission of sins with a worthy
miracle. All this ineffable, marvelous, and miraculous manner of working in
the Sacrament of Baptism, cannot consist in the natural alteration of any
substance of the outward water, but in the effect of grace, by the Spirit of
God working sunctification in the soul of the baptized, and remission of
sin; whereof the outward Baptism, in the judgment of Fathers, is but only
Hoc vero beneficium non aqua largitur, etc. sed Dei praeceptum and Spiritus:
aqu^ vero subs^ruit ad (...) purg (...). Greg. Nyssen. de sancto Baptis.
a representation.

42 Now follows the fifth point, which is reverence. What can make more for
the honor of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the^ that which their objected
Author, called (...). Dionys. Areopag. Eccles. Hi^rarch. cap. 2.
Dionysius Areopagita, ascribes unto Baptism? who speaking of the Minister
thereof, says, that he seeing the weight of this business, is in an horror
and agony: or that kind of salutation used by S. O aqua, quae Sacramentum
Christi esse (...), quae (...), etc Ambr^s. in (...). lib. 10 cap. 22.
Ambrose? saying; O water, which art worthily the Sacrament of Christ: or then
the conclusion which S. Quae (speaking of the Eucharist and Baptism) (...),
cum (...), qu^ (...) ea non carnali seruitute, sed spirituali pot^^s liberate
veneretur. August. ^^ doctr. Christian. lib. ^. ca. 9.
Augustine did observe, when speaking of the Eucharist and Baptism, Eucharist,
were very absurd. This confession, if we had no more, might satisfy us for
the discerning of the Fathers dialect, and to teach, that such expositors are
absurd, who do interpret the mystical speeches of the Fathers after the
literal sense. And if this be so, in respect of our feeding on Christ's body,
as our Adversary has granted; why is it not as true in regard of our real
eating, seeing every eating is proportionated unto a bodily feeding, as to his
p^oper end. So that, if bodily eating does as destinately agree with bodily
feeding, as does the spiritual with the spiritual: then must the literal
construction of bodily eating Christ's body, be judged equally absurd.

47 Which absurdity is made more apparent by paralleling the speeches of
Fathers, spoken of the Eucharist, whence our Adversaries would prove their
Transubstantiation. For as the Sea about. 15. per (...).
Fathers say, the bread is changed into an other nature; so say they also, that
the water in Baptism is changed into a divine nature. Which our Adversaries
are bound to expound figuratively.

48 Theophylact is objected saying, that Theophyl. in Matthew. 26. in Marc. 14.
in 1. Cor. 10. and 11. in Io^. 6. upon this does Bellarmin^ insult, numbering
this among the names: Quae sunt aequmalentia nomini Transubsta^tia tionis,
Theoph. in Marc. 14. vocat Trans^l^mentationem, qu^ (...) vox nihil
minussignifi^at quam transm^tati^^ est ^nim transelementatio mu^^tio rei vsqu^
ad prima element^, id est, vsque ad ipsam materiam, quae ab Aristotele
elementum vocatur. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 23. Secundo licuit. But
again the same Theophylact:
The bread is transelementated into the substance of Christ's body; but the
same Father says also, that Christ's body (...) id est, qui me manducat
propter me, quodammodo misc^tur mihi, and transelementatur in me. Theoph. in
Ioh. 6.
is transelementated into the faithful communicant. They say, that Hilarious de
Trinit. lib. 8. Quod autem nobis naturalis haec vnitas sit, ipse ita testatus
est; Qui edit meam carnem, in me manet. And, Christi caro naturaliter in nobis
manet -- and, Permanet nobis carnaliter and inseparabiliter vnitis, mysterium
verae and naturalis vnitatis sit praedicandum. Hilar. de Trinit. lib. 8.
Christ in this Sacrament is naturally united unto us: but they in like manner
affirm, that Non negamus recta nos fide, charitate que sincera Christo
spiritualiter coniungi: sed nullam in nobis coniunctionis rationem secundum
carnem cum illo esse, id profecto pernegamns. -- An fortassis putat ignotam
nobis mysticae benedictionis virtutem esse? quae cum in nobis fiat, nonne
corporaliter quoque facit, communicatione carnis Christi, Christum in nobis ha
itare? Cyril. Alex. lib. 10. c. 13.
the flesh of Christ (which our Adversaries will not allow in the proper sense)
remains in us naturally, corporally, and inseparably.

49 Their Cardinal Alterum testimonium Origenis est in Hom. 5. in diuersa loca
Euangelij, in qua tractat de puero Centurionis: [Quando sanctum cibum illudque
incorruptum accipis epulum, quando vitae pane and poculo frueris, manducas and
bibis corpus and sanguine^ Domini, tunc Dominus sub tectum tuum ingreditur. Et
tu ergo humilians teipsum-imitare hunc Centurionem, and dicito, Domine, non sum
dignus vt tu intres sub tectum meum. Vbi enim indigne ingreditur, ibi ad
iudicium ingreditur accipienti.] Haec ille. Sane ista non poslunt recte dici,
nisi de vero corpore Domini, quod vere ^re corporis accipiatur. Nam fi
loqueretur Origenes de corpore Domini per Metonymia^, id est, de pane
significance corpus Christi, non vocaret cum paneni incorruptum epulum, nec ei
dici vellet; Domine non sum dignus, etc. Si vero loqueretur de ipso Christo per
panem significato, qui per fidem accipitur, non diceret, Vbi indigne
ingreditur, ibi ad iudicium ingreditur accipienti. Nam secundum Aduersarios
Christus per fidem non potest accipi, ni^i a pi^s, and ad vitam. Bellarm. lib.
2. de Eucharist. cap. 8.. Akerum. col. 417.
Bellarmine presses much the saying of Origin, where he admonishes the
communicant in receiving the Eucharist, to say with the Centurio^, Lord I am
not worthy that thou should enter under the roof of my mouth: urging other
circumstances to prove that this cannot be meant metonymically, that is
figuratively. We marvel that a man of so sharp sight could not see the words
of the same Origin, which immediately preceded in the same sentence, saying,
Intrat nunc Dominus sub tectum credentium duplici figura vel more: nunc enim
quando Sancti and Deo acceptabil^s Ecclesiarum Antistites sub tectum tuum
intrant, tunc ibidem per cos Dominus ingreditur: and tu sic existime^ tanquam
Dominum suscipiens, and aliud quando sanctum cibum illudque, etc. As it
follows in the place above ci^ed by Cardinal Bellarmine, and his reasons are
frinolous. For first, Christ exhibited in the Sacrament (although without
corporal presence) is the Edulium incorruptum. 2. Secondly of the Pasters of
the Church, who bring the food of life, every one may say, Non s^m dignus.
Thirdly, the very wicked receive Christ sacramentally ministered unto them,
albeit they receive him not faithfully; and so by their own default, are
guilty of that body, which, ex part Christi, is offered unto them for
salvation.
Our Lord enters under the roof of believers by a double figure and manner:
now when godly Pastors of the Church enter into thy i house, then does the Lord
enter in by them: so think thou of it as though thou receiuedst the Lord
Christ. Evidently signifying the like manner of receiving Christ in the
Eucharist, the mystery of Christ; and in receiving for edi^ication a Pastor of
the Church, the Minister of Christ. How? not figura^^uely, says Cardinal
Bellarmine; Yes, by a figure, says the Father Origin.

50 Chrysostom has been by our Non se tantum videri permi^tir de^iderantibus,
sed and tangi, and manducari, and dente^ carnisuae infigi. Hom. 45. in Ioh.
Sens^^ verborum est, tangi corpus Christi mediantibus speciebus, quae solae

Adversaries no less vrgently obtruded, when he says, He suffers the
faithful to touch and eat him, yea and to press their teeth in his flesh.
And again, He truly mingleth himself with us: that is (s^ith M Semetipsum

Chrysostom. hom. 60. and 61. ad pop. Antioch. that it is as truly Christi body,
as Christians are one body, and flesh of Christ.
We are fed by him; which were See the former Sect.
absurd (says Cardinal Bellarmine) in the proper understanding: nor yet
considering Chrysostomes own exposition in the same place, or his answerable
hyperboles elsewhere, saying, that Vt and ipsa re in illam misceamur ca^nem.
Ibid hom. 61. i^ t^o.
we also are mingled into this flesh: that Quot nunc dieant, vellem ipsius

concedit non tantum videre, verum and manducate, and tangere, and intra se
suscipere. Chrysostom. hom 60. ad pop. Antioch. Non solum vestis, sed and corpus

cap 32.
our tongues are made red with his precious blood: which (as any one may
perceive) are but words of Rhetorical amplification.

51 If therefore the Romanists shall still dote upon this young Minion called
Transubstantiation, and for patronage thereof resume the former phrases of
Fathers, then are they furthermore compellable to show us what these other
speeches of Chrysostom may signify, which tell us of feeding upon Christ's
body, of seeing hugarme^ts, and of dying our tongues red imhis blood: or else
the like saying of S. Ambrose, C^m autem venerint ad Euangelium, and
cognouerint ^^^minari coecos. ambulare claudos, audire surdos. etc. tunc
dicunt, Vidimus eum, and oculis nostris perspeximus, and in vestigia clauorum
^^us dig^ros nostros inseruimus. Ambros. Com. in Luc. cap. 7.. De missione
Discipulorum Iohannis.
In hearing the Gospel we see Christ, and put our fingers into the prints of
his sides: or this of Pope Leo, Non aliud agit parti^ pa^io corporis Christi,
quam vt in id, quod sumimus, transeamus. Leo Romanus, Sermon. 14. de Pas^h. Dom.
We pass (or we are transformed) into the flesh of Christ: and, Corpus
regenerati fit caro cru^^fixi. Leo de passione Dom. cited by B. Iuell.
The body of a man regenerate is the flesh of Christ crucified: or lastly of
S. Gregory, that Licet Christus resurgent a mo^tius ^am non moritur, ta ^en in
seipso immortaliter and incorruptibiliter viuens, iterum in hoc mysterio
moritur, etc. Greg. Christus in hoc Sacramento patitur. Idem. See above.
Christ dies and suffers again in this mystery.

52 All these so ordinary sentences do plainly demonstrate and inculcate into
our minds the Fathers Judge. 12. 6.
Shibbolet, dialect, idiome, and propriety of speech: teaching us, that
Sacramental phrases must not be examined with a philosophical, but with a
theological eye, which clearly sees the sign called by the name of the
thing signified, evermore betokening a mystical truth; so that as yet we see
our Adversaries expositions of the terms of the Fathers to differ as much from
their sense, as mouth and faith, body and spirit, error and truth. We yet
further pursue a third observation, showing

That there is more safety and security in the doctrine of Protestants then of
the Romanists, for the holy repose of any Christian soul: proved by many and
pregnant Arguments.
The first concerning the true ^ssence of a body.
SECT. 18.
53 In the days of orthodoxall Fathers, many heretics, as Marcionists,
Valentinians, Eutychians, and others impugning the truth of Christ's Humanity,
fained that the body wherein he suffered, was not a natural, but only a
fantastical body, that is, having not the substance, but only the show of a
body: whom the Fathers confuted, proving that the body of our Lord was
substantial, because solid, sensible, palpable, and circumscribed in one
place. The new doctrine of Transubstantiation opens a wide gap unto those
ancient heresies, as is more fully proved by the weakness of the answer of our
greatest Argumen^^m hoc de phantasmate Marcionistarum mihi videtur verum
phantasma, videtur habere faciem quandam argumenti, and verum argume^tum non
est: nam phantasmata vel phantastica corpora, qualia haeretici putabant corpus
Christi, videntur esse corpora vera, and tamen reipsa non sunt vera. At corpus
Christi in Eucha^istia, ex Catholico^u^ sententia, non videnir oculis externis
esse verum corpus, tamen reipsa est. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euchar. cap. 24..
Calmnus quoque.
Adversary, who says, that fantastical is that, which appears to be that
which it is not: and so the heretics called the body of Christ fantastical:
but Catholics do teach, that the body of Christ is truly, (meaning
corporally,) although it appears not so to be. Which, we think, is not a
loosing, but a doubling of the knot, because their Transubstantiation
propounds a show of bread; Etiamsi panis nihil sit, tame^ id, in quod ipse
conuersus est, non est nihil, nec nullum, nec nu^quam. Non enim dicitur
annihilari quod manet in se, sed quod terminatur in nihil, ita vt terminus
actionis, qua ipsum depixit esse, nihil sit: alioqui aqua, quae a Domino versa
est in vinsi, annihilata fuisset: nam post conuersione^ nihil fuit, nulla fuit,
and nusqua^ fuit. Bellar. ibid.. Ad alteram:
whereas (say they) there is remaining no substa^^e of bread: most semblably
unto that grand heresy, which denying the substance of the body of Christ,
did only believe an appearance and phantasma, or show of a body. We desire our
adversaries to employ their best wits in the disquisition of this reply,
concerning the heretics opinion of Christ's body, and their own opinion of
the bread, and to show us how they are not both equally fantastical.

54 But God forbid that we should not adhere unto the orthodoxall faith of our
Ancestors, who contrariwise have distinguished the two natures of Christ,
Divinity, and Humanity, by these their different properties: his natural
body by being sensible, and in one place; the Divine nature by being not
sensible, and every where: making the faculty Cum ergo omnis creatura certis
naturae suae est circumscripta limitibus, etc. quomodo quis audeat creaturam
appellare Spiritum sanctum, qui non habet circumscriptam determinatam que
naturam? Ambros. lib. 1. de Spiritu sancto. cap. 7. So Theodoret, Dominicum
corpus incorruptibile resurrexit, and impatibile, and immortale, and diuina
gloria glorificatum est, and a coelestibus adoratur potestatibus. Corpus tamen
est priotem habens circumscriptionem. Dial. 2. 105.
of not being determined in one where, to be proper unto God; thereby proving
the Deity of the holy Ghost, and confirming it, saying: Theod. Dial. 2.
teaches, that it was the argument of the Orthodoxall, that is, the
Catholics: Nequaquam post sanctificationem mystica symbola propriam amittunt
naturam; manent enim in priore substantia, and figura, and specie, and cerni
and tangi possint ficut antea: intelliguntur autem quae facta sunt, and
creduntur and adorantur, quasi essent illa quae creduntur; confer igitur
archetypum cum imagine, etc. Page 113. b. See hereof above. 8. See Gelasi^^ and
others above. Ibid.
As bread remains bread after consecration; so the body of Christ, after the
resurrection remain^th still a natural body. So that their miraculous
Transubstantiation cannot stand, except they will work thereby a new miracle,
in raising again an old rotten heresy out of the grave of a just unbelief
and oblivion.

A second argument of security, from the consideration of the presence of a
body.
SECT. 19.
55 From the consideration of the essence of Christ's humane body, we come unto
the presence thereof in any place, which must be agreeable unto the Article of
Christian faith; teaching us Christ his residence in heaven until his coming
unto judgment, according unto sacred Act. 2.
Scriptures, and the Fathers of reverend antiquity, especially S. Augustine;
who for the preservation of the truth of Christ's humane nature, will not admit
of the presence of a body in many places at once: for this is (says he)
Immortalit^rem dedit, naturam non abstulit. August. ad Dard^^ se^ epist 57.
Sicut Dei Fili^ and Redemptorem nostrum secundum diuinitatem (...) and
incorp^r^um, sicu^ and Patrem and Spiritum sanctum non ^reder^ impium est; ita
cundem Dei Filium in homine ^ssumptum, visibilem, corpo^^um, ^tque local^m post
resurrectionem non credere and pr^^^teri profanum est. August in lib. de
esse^t. diuinit. tom. 4. Cauendum ne, ita (...) astruamus hominis vt vericatem
corporis auferamus. Non est ^utem consequen^, vt quod in Deo est, ita (...) vbi
que vt Deus. Ead. epist. Tom. 2 page 104. Spacia locorum ^olle corponbus and
corpora nusqua^ erunt, and quia nusqua^ erunt, nec erunt. Ibid. Paris. anno
1586.
pr^f^nely to destroy the proper nature of a body, because the body which is
not circumscribed in one place, is no what, because no where.

56 Many such sentences might be produced, which cannot be eluded by that only
answer of our Adversaries, understanding that Christ is not present on earth
and in heaven at one time, to wit visibly, or by a natural, but by a
supernatural manner. Which will be too raw matter for their stomachs, who are
accustomed unto the arguments of ancient Fathers, whom they find thus arguing:
Secundum maiestatem suam, secundum prouidentia^, secundum ineffabilem and
inuisibilem gratiam impletur quod ab eo dictum est, Ecce ego vobiscum sum
omn^bus diebus ysque ad consummationem seculi. Secundum carnem ver^ quam Verbum
assumpsit, secundum id quod de Virgin nature est, secund^mid quod a Iudaeis
prehensus est, quod ligno confixus, quod de cruce depositus, quod lin^eis
inuolutus, quod sepulchro positus, quod in resurrectione manifestatus, non
semper habebiris vobiscum. Et paulo post, Secundum praesentiam maiestatis
semper habemus Christum, secundum praesentiam carnis rect^ dictum est
Discipulis, Me autem non semper habebitis. August. Tract. 50. in verse. 8. cap.
12. Ioh. Etenim si hoc modo esset corpus eius nobiscum in terris, quomodo sunt
corpora multorum Martyrum, accurremus ad offerend^m ei muners, etc. In Psalm. 75.
If Christ (according to his bodily presence) sit at the right hand of the
Father in heaven, then doubtless he is not in the world by the presence of his
flesh. Judging this so plain a point, even by the Article of his And upon the
Article of Christ's ascension into heaven: Voluit praemuni^e aures nostras
aduersus eos, quos procedentibus temporibus sciebat dicturos, Ecce hic
C^ristus, ecce illie, quibus ne crederemus admonuit. Nec vlla est excusatio
aduersus vocem magistri tam claram, vt nemo vel ^^tusus and stupidus possit
dicere non intellexi. De unit. Eccles. c. 10. Et, Nemo dubitet cum iam Christus
ascenderit in coelo^, quamui^ virtute spiritus nobi^ adsit, praesentia tamen
carnis ipsu^ abesse. And, [Quaerite quae su^su^ sunt, vbi Christus est ad
dextra Dei, quae sursum suot sapite. non quae sunt super terra^, Colos. 3.] and
[Talem habemus Pontificem, qui seder ad dextra^ throni maiestatis etc.] Vnd^
Am^rosius: Ergo non in terra, nec secundum carnem quaerendus est Christus, si
vo^un^us eum inuenire. And again: Quando reutr^eris, Domine, nisi in die
iudicij?
ascension, that every one remains inexcusable who shall deny it: because
there is none so stupide but may understand it.

57 We return unto the Sacrament, whereupon the Fathers (in confutation of
fantastical heretics, who impugned the substantial being of Christ's body)
have built this their resolution: Nostra (...) est Eucharistiae, and
Eucharistia rursus confirmat sententiam nostra^. Iren. l. 4. contra here is. c.
34.
Our doctrine (says Irenaeus) is agreeable unto the Eucharist, and the
Eucharist confirms our doctrine. We wish our doctrine tried by the like
analogy. The Romish Transubstantiation in the Eucharist, does contradict the
doctrine of Christ's true natural body, as has been proved out of Theodoret
and others; and will appear by the desperatnesse of the last evasion which our
Adversaries are driven unto, answering that Christ is in the Eucharist, not
after the manner of a body by circumscription, nor as a spirit is by
determination, but more excellently, even Quod^^ quis contendat esse in loco
tam circumscriptiue quam definitiu^, id requirere, vt res nullo modo sit alibi:
dicere possumus, dari tertisi modu^ e^istendi in loco; quomodo Deus est in
loco, and hoc modo esse in loco ea corpora, quae per diuina^ potentia^ simul
sunt in varij^ locis. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch* c. 4.. Altero modo.
by presence (the words of Cardinal Bellarmine) after the manner of God. Lo
what affinity this has with the old heresy, which fancied Christ's body to
be altogether spiritual.

concerning this question, dedicated unto Pope Sixtus Quintus, professedly
writing hereof, says thus; There are at this day seven different opinions
concerning the formal words of consecration: first among them who defend the
form to consist in [hoc est corpus meum, etc.] Another, Rursum, alia agitatur
inter Scholasticos quaestio: An verba Christi materialiter, an ve^o
significatiue in consecrationis forma sumantur. Hic iterum magna reperitur
opinionum diuer^^tas. Bona pars tenet, quod materialiter sumantur, sed diuisi
hi inter se sunt, quis quidam dicunt quod materialiter tantum sumantur: alij
vero quod simul materialiter and significatiue, vt D. Thomas, and sui
sectatores: alij quod partim materialite^, partim significatiue. Sunt alij, qui
ea significatiue tantum accipi asserunt, vt Marsil, in 4. Inno centius autem
tertius, and Innocentius quartus, and Glossa in Can. Timorem. de consecr. d. 2.
tenent quod materialiter tan^^m sumantur, quos sequuntur multi ex Scholasticis.
Qui vero ea significatiue sumi asserunt, diuisi sunt in tot varias opiniones,
vt vix eas numerare sit. Certe Guido Brianzonis super 4. Sent numerat nouem,
and suam adijcit, quae decimam facit. Idem ibid. verb^seqq.
Great diversity there is how to understand them, whether significatiuely, or
materially, partly, or wholly, only, or and also. And those that understand
them significatiuely, to have begot innumerable diversities. Finally, they who
require other prayers before these words, hoc est corpus meum, to be necessary
for consecration, are so distracted, that the said Est alia quaestio: An solis
quatuor verbis, Hoc est corpus meum, fieri consecratio possit. Hic iterum in
duas sunt dissecti opiniones: S. Thomas, and illius opinionem sequentes tenent,
quod sic: Scotus tenet oppositum, dicens opus esse alijs verbis, per quae
Christi verba ad materiam applicari declaretur. Scoti opinionem seq^untur
multi, qui aiunt verba, quibus Christi verba ad materiam applicari
significatur, esse benedictionis Ecclesiae verba, quibus petit vt oblata munera
panis and vini, fiant corpus and sanguis Christi. Hanc opinionem sequuti sunt
Theologi Colonienses in suo Antididagmate contra Lutherum, and Lindanus Episc.
in sua Panoplia, and Catharinus in duobus de hac materia libellis Romae ab eo
editis. Colonienses and Lindanus tenent cum Angelo and Pelbarto, quod nihil
omnino fieret, si quis sol^ verborum prolatione sine Ecclesiastica prece
consecrare attentaret. Dominus Episcopus Ebroicensis in 7. de Euchar. repet.
Lindanum and Colonicuses contra Kemo^tium defendit, dicens, quod ideo preces
dixerint, cum Basilio magno, ad consecrationem esse necessarias, quia sine
adiunctis precibus innotes^ere Ecclesiae non possit, Christi verba ad
consecrationem faciendam admoueri. -- Male, vt ingenue fatear, animum meum
habuit ista opinionum in tanta, tantique momenti materia varietas, dum
Theologiae operam dabam, adeo vt horrori aliquando esset lectionibus illis
interesse, quas super his quaestionibus Doctores praelectores nostri habebant.
Quae opinionum varietas magis ac magis mihi displicere coepit, cum post
Theologici studij cursum, per varias Galliae civitates and prouincias,
praedicandi gratia cundum mihi fuit; eo quod haeretici cum nobis ista Doctorum
nostrorum super vero verborum Christi sensu dissidia obijcerent, me
pudefacerent, neque illis, licet in fidei dogmatis eos conuenite assererem,
satisfacere possem: imo nec doctis aliquot Catholicis. Idem ibid. verbis seqq.
page 5, 6, 7.
Bishop confesses himself enforced to blush when these so many discords were
objected by the Ptotestants: concluding from Et omnibus consideratis, ista,
Accipite, Hoc est corpus meum. Verbum Accipite, praebitionem significat; verba,
Hoc est corpus meum, quid praeberet declarane. Haec sola verba apud
Euangelistas and Paulum reperio, quae Christum corpus suum praebere
significent. Idem ibid. page 14
Scripture, and from the testimony of two Haec omnia sic sese necessario
consequuntur, vt vnum sine alio esse nequeat. Ex his autem deiude sequi video,
quod Christus his verbis, Hoc est corpus meum, non benedixit panem in coena,
quae fuit duorum summorum Pontificum, Innocentij tertij, and Innocentij quarti
sententia, ac multorum antiquorum Patrum. Ibid. page 15.
Popes, and a consequent Nam benedictionem fieri per sola verba, quae natura
sunt posteriora ipsa benedictione, impossible prorsus est. Ipso enim est
absurdius absurdo dicere. Idem ibid. page 19.
absurdity, that in those words, [hoc est corpus meum,] is not the power of
benediction and consecration. All which he has avouched in his dedicatorie
Epistle, nuncupated to the then Pope.

64 What shall we need to speak of their common opinion, which ascribes the
whole virtue of consecration unto the words of Christ, [this is my body?]
wherein by this one little word, hoc, this, their wits have been Nota,
Catholicos, etsi conueniunt in ^e, tamen non conuenire in modo explicandi, quid

Christi. -- Si ita esset, verba erun^ speculatiua, non practica. -- Est altera

of time, wherein the last of these words, [hoc est corpus meu^] is uttered. And
this interpretation they lay resoluedly for the sole ground of
Transubstantiation: notwithstanding that (according to the judicious censure of
their own forecited Vnus Scotus ausus est dicere, -- Christum -- dando

Bishop, Transubstantiation is thereby overthrown: who therefore calls this
new evasion a figment, and a labor full of absur ditie, and notably confuteth
their fundamental Sic distinguit Scotus practicam propositionem a speculatiua.
Speculat^ua, inquit, praesupponit tem ita se habere atque significat. Practica
vero non praesupponit rem, sed eam facit. Licet ista distinctio ^^ihi non

de^^de asserant, ex quibus sequatur eam non esse practicam. Atunt enim, quia
conuersio panis sit in instanti, eam non esse veram vsque ad vltimum instan^
prolationis ipsius: Quod idem est dictu, cum eo quod Patres de illa dicunt, viz
eam non esse veram, nisi prius sit facta Transubstantiatio ^pis. Caesari^n.
i^id. fol. 19 -- Ideo autem expectandum ait vltimum istud instans, ^o quod ante
conuersionem non posset esse vera, and Patres dicunt, quia vera est* quando

cius veritate sequi, Transubstantiationem* quae si facta prius non esset, esset
propositio falsa. Idem ibid. paulo post. -- ^t hoc tenet ^otus. -- Praesupponit

Vnde consequent ^^ infertur quod sit speculatiua, non practica, maxim cum

distinction of a speculatiue, and a praiticall proposition: whose testimony
we have related somewhat at large, both for our better discharge, and fuller
satisfaction of them that shall desire to know it.

65 He proceeds yet further to prove this Assertion, viz. the words of
consecration are in prayer of blessing before these words of institution, [hoc
est corpus meum, etc.] both from Probatur ex verbo Dei, Christum prius
consecrasse, quam ista verba diceret, Hoc est corpus meum. Ibid cap. 5. Quod

wrought upon a bar of iron, must needs set their teeth on edge; the rather

Transubstantiation by those arguments, whereby others labor to confirm it.
And if these irreconciliable wrangles of their contradictorie Doctors be so
prejudicial, then doubtless

The contradictions inuolued in the Doctrine it self, proved by the
testimonies of our Adversaries, may serve for a fifth argument of our security.
SECT. 22.
66 An argument taken from absurdities, is, in this question of the manner of
Christ's presence, thought by our learned Adversary M. D. Interea Lutherani, qui
veritatem corporis Christi cum pane subsistere volunt, multos absurdos sensus
confingunt: primo, ipsum panem esse corpus Christi, deinde sub pane esse corpus
Christi, vbi res disparatae de se inuicem praedicantur; deinde sub p^ne esse
corpus Christi, quod non nisi in figuram resoluitur mox cum pane esse corpus
Christi, vbi vnionem coguntur fingere quasi hypostaticam. Stapleton. Promptu.
Cathol. seria 3. Hebdom. Sanctae,. 3. in haec verba [Hoc est corpus meum.]
Stapleton to be very ponderous and considerable, who refuteth
Consubstantiation, because it is fraught with many absurd senses: which
argument the more weighty it is, the more grievously must it press, yea and
oppress all transubstantiators, because of the many absurdities which may
seem to attend upon this one opinion, although they should not be debated, but
only repeated. Before we enter into particulars, let this be observed for a
general Principle, which has in it all the rules of a Maxim or Principle
(...), etc. and is approved of all men of whatsoever opinion in the world: to
wit, There cannot possibly be any truth in any doctrine, which contains in it
a contradiction.

67 First then their Thomas in 4. did. 44. q. 2. art. 2 and quidam alij
Catholici existimant, non posse vnum corpus esse in duobus locis localiter, sed
tantum sacramentaliter. -- Et rationem hanc reddunt, quia vnum est illud quod
est indiuisum a se, and diuisum a quocunque alio, ex quibus conditionibus
prior, indiuisum ise, essentialis and inseparabilis, altera non.
Aquinas (besides other Catholics) a Doctor sometime esteemed of our
Adversaries as the Oracle of the Romish School, whom for his profound
learning, and search into the mysteries of all Divinity, they surnamed
Seraphical; he from an argument of contradiction did conclusiuely resolve, that
it is absolutely impossible for one body to be at the same time locally in
many places at once: whence it must follow (by the judgment of Cardinal Sed
haec ratio, pace tanti Doctoris dixerim, non est solida; nam duplex est
indiuisio a se: -- vna respectu loci, quae extrinseca est, and plane
accidentaria; alia respectu rei ipsius, quae est intrinseca, and vel est de
essentia, vel certe proprietas quaedam vnitatis. -- Cum vnum corpus est in
diuersis locis, non tollitur indiuisio intrinseca, sed solum extrinseca,
respectu loci: nam non diuiduntur principia intrinseca, quae corpus
constituunt, sed solum diuiduntur situs, sieve vbi illius corporis. Which answer
is very insufficient, because that this division does not respect diuersa vbi:
for the same body in his diverse members is in diverse places at once: but by the
Jesuits doctrine the same body is feined to be on one altar, and on a second,
but yet not in the place of distance between them both. In this, not being,
consists the division, which does as necessarily prove diuersa vbitata. as
diuersa vbi. But we come to his next confutation of Thomas: Quod si non posset
esse vnum corpus localiter in duobus locis, quia diuideretur a seipso (as
Thomas held,) profecto nec possit esse sacramentaliter, eadem ratione; licet
enim esse alicubi sacramentaliter non dicat esse per loci occupationem, tamen
dicit esse per realem and veram praesentiam, quae realis praesentia in tot
hostijs, sieve Altaribus, and non in locis intermedijs, non minus tollere
videtur indiuisionem rei, quam repletionem plutium locorum. Bellarm. lib. 3. de
Eucharist. cap. 3.. Quidam tamen. See Thomas, part. 3. Sum. qu. 76.
Bellarmine,) that it cannot possibly be sacramentally in diverse places at
once. Where we may note, that as Aquinas, their ancient Bellarmine, has given
us our antecedent, viz. no body can possibly be locally in two places at one
time; so Bellarmine, their present Aquinas, has granted us our consequent,
viz. that it must follow upon that impossibility, that there can be no
Transubstantiation, or being of Christ's bodily presence, no not (as the
Romanists understand it) sacramentally, because of a contradiction.

68 And when their two most famous Jesuits contend to show a possibility of
the presence of Christ's body in many hosts, and places at once, then they
strain their voices (...), above the reach of any Schoole-man ever before
them, in believing that the humane body of Christ Vident, qui doctiores sunt,
qua ratione vnum corpus in pluribu^ locis sine repugnantia esse posse
defenditur, eadem ratione desendi posse, quod sine repugnantia esse possae in
omnibus locis per Dei potentiam, absolutam: neque obstat quod Patres sancti
sensisse videntur, vbiquitatem esse Dei propriam, maxim cum ex eo diuinitatem
Spiritus sancti probant, quod ille sit vbique -- quia omnipraesenti^ suapte
natura, non aliena virtute intelligunt. -- Vt maxim humanitas Christi possit
diuinitus poni vbique, assertionem tamen esse haereticam, quod ea iam vbique
sit. Gregor. Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de vera Christi pr^sentia, cap. 12.
may possibly (although this, in Cardinal Bellarmine his judgment, is Dicimus
corpus Christi esse vbicunque sunt hostiae consecrat^: -- at dicere corpus
Christi vel esse vel esse posse in infinitis locis simul, immensitatem
requirit. Bellar. lib. 3. de Christ^, cap. 18.. Quod.
impossible) be every where in an instant: and that it is not in this Sacrament
either circumscriptiuely or definitiuely, but Quod si quis dicat, esse in loco
tam circumscriptiue, quam definitive, id requirere vt res nullo modo sit alibi,
dicere possumus dari tertium modum existendi in loco, nimirum per solam
praesenti^, quomodo Deus est in loco: and hoc modo esse in loco ea corpo^a quae
per diuinam potentiam simul sunt in diuersis locis. Bellar. ibid. cap. 4..
Alcero modo, etc.
after that manner God is said to be in place, that is, only by a presence;
herein without any light of antiquity imagining a presence without a manner of
prefence, except it be that omnipresence, which is an only prerogative of God
himself, and not communicable unto any created nature.

69 Secondly, they allowed us this undoubted principle, that Ob. De essentia
quantitat^s est habere partem extra partem, ergo vbi est vna pars, non est
alia: non ergo tota quantitas corpori^ Domini in eadem hostiae particula esse
potest. Resp. Bellar. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 7.. Ad quartum. Quantitas non
potest existere nisi quantitatiue quantum ad essentialem modum, quia non potest
existere sine extensione, and partium distinctione in se. And then comes to
answer the point in question.. Ad octauum. Corpus habere partem extra partem,

locum. Ibidem. Fatemur Christi corpus vbicunque est habere suam formam and

it is an essential property in every thing which has quantity, to be so
disposed, that one part of the fame subject be distinct from another. Whereupon
we may be bold to Ob Corpus Christi cum sit organicum habet parts determinate
distant^s, est enim de ratione organici corpo^is determinata distantia
singularum partium ad inuicem, sicut oculi ab oculo, and oculi ab aure. Ergo

argue, that (seeing in every organicall body one part is severed from
another, is an eye from an ear) the whole body of Christ is in every part of
the host. The force of this consequent their great Aquinas could not otherwise
avoid, but through the help of this thick mist, answering, that the body of
Christ is in the host, not after the nature of a body, but according to the
nature of a Quantitas dimensiua corporis Christi est in hoc Sacramento non
secundum proprium modum: vt scilicet sit totum in toto, and singulae parts in

substance, which naturally is wholly in the whole, and whole in every part:
which utterly dissolueth the confessed essential property of a bodily
substance, which has the whole consisting of parts really distinguished one
from another, and not such a substance, where either any one part is in
another, or the whole is in every part: which their own Sed secundum hoc

Canonist in his ancient Gloss excludes with a non credo, as being unworthy
of faith.

70 We may not insist upon other such like contradictions, as when they say,
that the body, Prima part regulae cerussima est, quia realis pr^^tentia
corporis Christi id necessario requi^it, vt niotis speciebus vere moueatu^
corpus Christi, quamuis per accidens: quomodo anima nostra vere inutae locum:

according unto the motion of the host, is truly and properly lift up: but

body. Wherein we see two things plainly professed by all Protestants; first,
that the words of this Sacrament are not to be expounded according to their
literal and proper sense: secondly, that the matter of this Sacrament is the
very body and blood of our Lord truly offered and exhibited unto us. Both
these, according to our intended manner of evidence, must be briefly and
plainly confirmed.

76 First, we prove, that the words admit not a proper and literal exposition,
but are to be interpreted as Protestants teach, Whether it be by a metonymie,
as is confessed of Calvin, and others, (see the testimony going before) or by
a Synecdoche, as some Lutherans. Cassander says,
figuratively, whether it be by a Metonymie or by a Non tamen identicam
praedicationem (speaking of the Lutherans) asserunt, neque in e^ loquutione
Tropum aspernantur modo is tropus praesentiam carnis Christi non tollat; quam

Christi,] huiusmodi interpretatiu^ explicant, vt per eam intelligant, In pane,
sub pane, cum pane, etc. quae forma loquendi apud veteres quoque repetitur.
Cassander Consult. Art. 10.
Synecdoche. Contrariwise the Romanists affirm, that Proptie non figurate
explicanda esse illa verba [Hoc est corpus meum.] Bellar. lib. 1. de Euchar.
cap. 9 And he proves this by such arguments which do equally conclude, that no
word spoken concerning that Sacrament, can be understood figuratively, but
only in the proper and literal sense: as for example:
th^se words are not figuratively, but properly to be expounded: because (as
they pretend,) Argumentum a materia institutionis: materia est pactum,
testamentum, Sacramentum, quae omnia requirunt propriam non figuratam
locutionem. -- Secundum argumentum a personis, quibuscum loquebatur, viz.
Apostolis, qui rudes and simplices fuerunt, quibus omnia clarissime proponebat,
vel obscurius dicta continuo exponebat, deinde loquebatur eo tempore, quo
minime oportebat obscur^ loqui, nimirum, cum Apostoli facti sunt primi
participes tanti Sacramenti, M. Stapleton uses the same reasons and adds: --
Quarto ratione Sacramenti quod hic institu^tur, cuius verba Sacramentalia
proprie and perspicue offerri debent, non obscure and figurate. Stapleton.
Prompt. Catholic. Ser. 3. Hebd. sancta.. Tertia. page 268.
the matter of this Sacrament, being Christ's Testament; the persons to whom he
spoke being Apostles, even simple men, the nature of the action being a
Sacrament, do all require that the words of this Sacrament should be delivered
in plain and proper phrases: as though in the institution of this Sacrament,
Christ had spoken nothing figuratively; wherein the Romanists by making
themselves Adversaries unto Protestants, are (as almost in all other points)
found to be the greatest Adversaries to themselves.

77 For notwithstanding their former denial of any trope or figure in this
case, yet have they been constrained to note, in the words of Christ's
institution of this Sacrament, many figurative and improper terms of speech.
Some think (amongst others Doctor Hic literalis sensus luculentissime pater,
ex comparatione aliarum Scripturarum, in quibus tale intelligitur subiectum,

Stapleton,) that in these words [this is my bodie] the demonstratiue particle
[this] can signify nothing but (the pradicate) body: which exposition seems

videtur dicere, pronomine illo non demonstrari rem praesentem. -- Pronomina
demonstratius mox indicant certum aliquid, etiam antequam sequantur caeterae

practica, (at secundum Catholicos sunt practica) quia semper verum erit
demonstrato Christi corpore, dicere, Hoc est corpus Christi. -- At verba
practica and operatoria non sunt vera antequam Sacramentum (meaning the
pronunciation of the last word meum) efficiatur. Bellarm. lib. 1 de
Eucharistia, cap. 11.. Nota secundo.
Cardinal Bellarmine to be absurd, because this is to signify Christ's body,
before there is any presence of his body. And could the defenders of this
interpretation excuse themselves without a figure?

78 Their Cardinal resolves contrarily, that the Pronoune [ Alter a est
sententia Thomae and aliorum multorum dicentium, quod pronomen hoc non
demonstret praecise panem nec corpus, sed in communi substantiam, quae sub
illis speciebus continetur: sic tamen vt demonstratio proprie ad species

(says he) under these accidents is my body: as he shows by an example,
which proves that this is so plainly a figurative speech, as when a man
promising his friend the use of his purse, does figuratively mean the money in
his purse.

79 As for their common exposition (as they call it,) of [hoc, this,] to
signify, De indiuiduo vago. Non dicimus cum Scoto, Hoc. id est, haec
substantia, vel hoc ens: -- qu^i necesse est vt praesen^ sit substantia illa,

not this distinct substance, but more co^fusedly Sed dicimus, Hoc. id est,

praesens, sed satis est si praesentes sint species, quae demonstrantur
pronomine, His, id est sub his speciebus Ibid.. Ad^d vero. Et Greg Valent.
supra.
substance, meaning the substance under the form of bread (as though there
could be a substance called [this] which is not this substance,) it is a
metaphysicall Chimaera, far exceeding (we think) the capacity of any man,
and therefore worthily censured by their late learned Pronomen vice nominae
proprij positum pro solo singulari sumi potest. -- Cum Scriptura duorum tantum
meminit. panis and corporis nescio cur tertiam singant aliquam substantiam,
quae nec panis est, nec corpus, quae tamen per pronomen demonstretur, in quo
magnam vim Scripturae faciunt. Si autem nullam tertiam rem ponere se dicunt
quae sit alia a Christi corpore, cur non came nudam proponunt, sed tertiam se
quaerere dicunt, a pane and corpore di^creta^^ labor est absurditate plenus.

Bishop for a curious absurdity, pernerting the sense of holy Scriptures.
Therefore the Romanists (except they will confess their interpretations to be
absurd,) do stand chargeable for three figures in expounding one little
Pronoune [this.]

80 They are not sparing in this kind; for where Christ said [which is given
for you,] their Jesuit [Hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis datur, Luc. 22] Id
est, quod offeretur a me pro vobis in cruce mactatum. Greg. Valen Ies. l. 1. de
Missa Sacros. c. 3.. Igitur, etc.
Valentia does expound the word given to signify, offered upon the cross.
Where Christ said, [take, eat, this is my body,] their ancient Jesuit
Salmeron (contrary unto Christi corpus vere ac proprie manducatur in
Eucharistia, non tropice. Bellar. lib 1. de Euch. c. 11.. Resp. corpus.
Bellarmine,) understands, that the verb eat does signify Dicitur panis
frangi, imo Christi corpus frangi and manducari, quia and species franguntur,
and ipsu^ Christi corpus spiritualiter frangi, and manducari cum fide sumitur,
and quisque suam partem tra^ittnam and Dominus dixit ^ucae 22. Hoc est corpus
meum. quod pro vobis frangitur. Salmeron Ies. Com. in 1. Cor. 10. disp 17.. Sed
ecce.
receiving by faith. Where both in the Gospel, and in S. Paul's epistle, the
body is said to be [broken,] Dicitur panis frangi, imo Christi corpus frangi
and manducari, quia and species franguntur, and ipsu^ Christi corpus
spiritualiter frangi, and manducari cum fide sumitur, and quisque suam partem
tra^it^nam and Dominus dixit ^ucae 22. Hoc est corpus meum. quod pro vobis
frangitur. Salmeron Ies. Com. in 1. Cor. 10. disp 17.. Sed ecce.
which is to be understood spiritually, their Jesuit Maldonate says,
Sacramentalis locutio esset, si corpus Christi diceretur frangi and dentibus
teri, quemadmodum Chrysostom. locutus est: haec enim non possunt nisi Sacramento
tenus intelligi, quia non corpus proprie frangitur, sed Sacramentum. Maldon.
Ies. Com in Matthew. 26. immediately before the 27. verse.

Herborandus a Protestant,) lacerari a nobis Christum, cum hostiam in tres
parts diuidimus. Resp. Christu^ sic esse in hostia, vt nec frangi nec pati
aliquid que at. Greg. Valen. Ies. lib. 2. de Sacris. Missae, c. 3. quia fractio

It cannot be taken properly: which interpretation their Cardinal Bellarmine
confesses to be Aliqui (speaking of their own Doctors,) volunt ea quae
dicuntur a Christo ratione specierum, vere and proprie dici eo modo quo
dicerentur de pane, si ades^et; panis enim dicitur vere and proprie videri,
tangi, frangi, ratione accidentium suorum. -- At sententia communis Theologorum
contrarium docet: Ideo sit regula, ea verba quae significant motum localem,
vere ac proprie dicuntur de corpore Christi in Eucharistia existente, ratione
specierum, licet per accidens, non per se; caetera autem quae significant alias
mutationes vel act ones, dicuntur quidem de corpore Christi, ratione specierum,
sed improprie and figurate. Vere ac proprie dicimus corpus Christi attolli,
depont, deferri, collocari in altari And again, consuting the former opinion
of some Papists. Secundum quod, sicut dicunt Christum vere ac proprie vide^i,
and tangi; ita possent dicere eum calefieri and frigefieri, imo and mucidum and
acidum fieri: -- at illa nemo plane concederet. Bellar. l. 1. de Euch^^ cap.
2.. Sed existit Because outward and sensible actions are used for signification
of inward and spiritual.
the common judgment of Divines, who affirm, that the body cannot be said to
be broken, but only in the accidents of bread. Where Christ said furthermore,
[this is the Cup of the new Testament: (...)

(says Tollet) are buried together with Christ, that is, they represent Christ
buried, Baptism it self being a sign of his burial.

84 This one instance in so great a Sacrament, may instruct us, that it is the
common Idiome and manner of speech used by the holy Ghost, in matters mystical
(that is, Sacramental,) to speak in a Sacramental, that is, a figurative
tenor of speech. For as the observation taken by their Jesuit Ribera, to wit;
Peruulgatum est in Scriptura, vt res figurata nomen habeat figurae. Ribera
Iesuita Com. in Apoc. cap 14. v. 8.
in Scripture the thing signified is usually called by the name of the figure,
or sign, is true: so is it that the sign carries the name of the thing
signified, as Genesis 17.
circumcision is called the covenant. Which made the ancient Fathers, as
namely, Acceptum panem and distributum suis, corpus suum illis fecit, dicendo,

85 Hereunto S. Augustine has as it were set his seal, witnessing that Si
Sacramenta quandam similitudinem rerum earum quarum sunc Sacramenta, non
haberent, minime sacramenta essent: ex hac autem similitudine plerique iam
ipsarum rerum nomana accipiunt. Sicut ergo Sacramentum corporis Christi corpus
Christi est, Sacramentum sanguinis Christi, sanguis Christi est; i^a
sacramentum fidei fides est. Paulo post: Sicut de ipso Baptismo Apostolus ait:
Consepulti, inquit, sumus, Romans 6.] Non ait, sepulturam significamus; sed
prorfu^ ^it, consepulti sumus. Sacramentum ergo tan^ae rei non nifi eiu^dem rei
vocabulo nuncup a^it. Augustine. tom. 2 epist. 23. ad ^onifac. Bafil. 1569. and
Paris. 1586. and Beda in Romans 6.
Sacraments, that is, the outward signs, because of the similitude and
resemblance they have unto those things which they are ordained to represent,
assume for the most part the names and appellations of the things themselves.
And, for example, does instance in both the Sacraments of the new Testament,
first of the Eucharist, saying, The Sacrament of the body of Christ is
(meaning, called) the body of Christ: and secondly of Baptism, The Apostle
says (says he,) we are buried therein; he says not we signify the
Sepulcher, but flatly says, we are buried, calling the Sacrament (that is, the
sign) of so great a thing, by the name of the thing it self. So that none may
henceforth call it an heretical exposition which Protestants hold, if S.
Augustines judgment may be thought to be sound and Catholicall: who does
furthermore hold it Locutio praeceptiua flagitium aut facinus vetan^, aut
vtilitatem aut been ficentiam iubens, non est figura^a: si autem flagitium aut
facinus videtur iubere, aut vtilitatem ac beneficentiam vetare, figurata est.
Nisi manducaueritis carnem filij hominis, etc. facinus vel flagitium videtur
iubere, figura ergo: praecipiens passioni Domini communicandum, and suauiter
and vtiliter recondendum in memoris, quod pro nobis caro ^iu^ crucifixa and
vulnerata est. Augustine. Tom. 3. de doctr. Christ. lib. 3. cap. 15. 16.
barbarous impiety, to expound the manner of eating of Christ otherwise then
figuratively. Thus after our confirmation of our exposition, we are come now at
last to show

A ninth argument of safety in the Protestants defense; because although they
believe not Transubstantiation, yet notwithstanding do they receive the body
of Christ more really and truly in the Sacrament of the Eucharist: by many
reasons, whereof some are deduced from the testimonies of our Adversaries.
SECT. 26.
86 More then erroneous is that censure which our Adversaries have passed upon
Protestant Churches, in regard of their Eucharist; one Christus nouus (meaning
of Protestants) illis nihil nisi strustu^ panis est, and vini portiun^ula, etc
Salmeron. Ies. in Epist. Pauli in genere. Disp. 11.. Septimo Christus.
Jesuit calling it only a crust of bread, and a pittance of wine: an Haeresis
erat quorundam, qui Eucharistiam tantum esse volebant figuram corporis Christi.
Hanc heres^n docet Caluinus. Bellar. lib. de notu Eccles. cap. 9.. Quorundam.
other traducing their doctrine, as though they maintained, with ancient
heretics, only a figure of Christ's body: wronging their own consciences, and
that (as may be feared) wittingly, seeing they could not be ignorant what
Protestants profess, namely, Haec est eoru^ sententia, etc. Greg. Valent. Ies.
and others. See above.
that (as their own Jesuit acknowledges) although Christ be corporally in
heaven, yet is he received of the faithful communicants in this Sacrament
truly, both spiritually by the mouth of the mind, through a most near
conjunction of Christ with the soul of the receiver by faith, and also
sacramentally with the bodily mouth, receiving not Christ, (meaning, Intelligit
Caluinus, no^ per localem praesentiam, sed per quandam communicationem. Bellar.
lib. 1. de Eucharist. cap. 10.. Est autem.
not Christ according to his local presence,) but bread and wine, as seals
and signs of the promise of redemption in his body and blood.

87 If therefore, as Pilate once asked, John 18. 38.
what is truth? it shall be examined what is our truly receiving of Christ in
this Sacrament: we may answer, that therein is a double truth, to wit,
spiritual or inward, Christ's body; and sacramental, in the outward element:
the first in faith, the second in a figure: yet so, that the reality and truth
of our receiving does consist rather in the act of the soul, then in the
faculty of any bodily instrument. For this cause John 1. 47. This is a true
Israelite.
Nathanael, not in respect of his natural offspring, but of the sincerity of
his soul, was called a true Israelite; the godly Christian who conceiueth
Christ in his soul by faith, is named Christ's true Matthew. 12. 47. Who is my
mother ^^er. 49. stretching his hands unto his dis^iples, said, Behold my
mother, etc. Verse. 50. Whosoever does the will of my Father, he is my --

Manna, and died, but I am the bread of life, giving life unto the world, and if
any eat hereof, he shall live for ever: my flesh is meat indeed. And again,
this is the bread of life, because the truth of a thing consists especially

Jesuit is glad to answer, that I am persuaded, that if S. Augustine, so great
an enemy unto heretics, had lived in these days, he would have been of an
other mind, when he had once perceived the Caluinists interpretation to be
almost the same. He might as truly have said, the same altogether: for if S.
Augustine and others thought that the Israelites did as truly eat and feed
upon the body of our Lord, who is in this respect called [the Apoc. 13. 8.
Lamb slain from the beginning of the world,] when as yet, before Christ his
incarnation, they could not eat him bodily: we may boldly, from that which
has been confessed, entitle S. Augustine, Bid Strabus, and Rupertus in the
Protestants faith of real eating. Which manner may be illustrated; for

The manner of our real receiving Christ's body, is shadowed by a lively
resemblance.

of a Kingdom, City, or Farm, so (says M. Est autem reuocandum in memoriam,

Bellarmine calls a figment, yet would he be loath to associate S. Bernard
with M. Calvin in a fiction: Sacramentum dicitur sacrum signum, sieve sacrum
secretum. -- vt ex ^sualibus sumatur exemplum: datur annulus propter annulum,
and nulla est significatio; datur annulus ad inuestiendum de haereditate
aliqua, and annulus signum est: ita vt iam dicere possit, qui accipit, annulus
non valet quicquam, sed haereditas est quam quaere^am. Bernard. sermon. de Coena.
A Sacrament (says S. Bernard) is a sacred sign or mystery, as may be
explaned by a common example: for if I give a ring, then has it no
signification; but if I give a ring, thereby to inuest a man in the right of
some inheritance, it is now both a ring and a sign: so that he that receives
it may say, the ring is of no worth, but the inheritance is the thing that I
sought.

93 We now demand of our Adversaries, when a Bishop is invested in his
Bishopric, by receiving the Popes Palle; or any man made heir of any portion
of land by the gift of a ring, or (if they will) of a rush received from the
true and faithful doner thereof: whether these are thereby truly and really
interessed in those gifts, although in respect of place they be a thousand
miles distant? or will the parties contemn such precious gifts, because the
matter of conueiance is but a rush? So in this Sacrament the doner is Christ,
the gift is his precious body and blood, the high ransom of man's redemption,
conveyed unto mankind by the word and Sacrament, as by a visible deed of gift
under the signs and seals of common elements of bread and wine, consecrated
to that use; the right receiver is the penitent and faithful communicant.

94 This similitude agrees for the manner, albeit for the effectualnesse of
the manner we say, that the ods is no less then heaven and earth. For by this
faithful participation, there is wrought in the godly Christian an ineffable
and incomprehensible union and conjunction through faith, with the humanity of
Christ his redeemer; whereby he is also made* partaker of the divine nature, by
the power whereof he is sanctified in his body, and shall be immortalized in
the resurrection of the just, in that kingdom which ourhead Christ does now
bodily possess. And if the receipts of worldly possessions conveyed unto man
by such politic instruments, and (that I may so speak) sacraments, as signs
and feales ordained by men for the ratification of their grants, are held Real,
which notwithstanding vanish in mortality: how much more real is the gift and
receipt of that benefit, which exhibited unto us in corporal elements, has
the doner Christ, who is the eternal son of God; the gift, his precious and
glorious body, which is the everlasting ransom of his elect, and is received
by faith (which is the peculiar gift of the holy Ghost,) into the souls of the
faithful, which are the immortal spirits of his election.

95 Therefore have we just cause to pity the malice of our Adversaries, who
esteem no better of this our spiritual manner of eating, then of a See above.

done: To which of the Angels said God at any time, Sit thou at my right hand,

was more glorious then all the Angels. So we demand, of which of the elements,

which sanctifies the creatures of bread and wine to be seals of our faith.

mouth of any man, whosoever should say, in contempt of the Sacrament of
Baptism, that it is but the sprinkling of water, cold, and wel-water; because
the element of water remains in natural substance the same, seeing it is by
consecration changed into a divine and mystical use. But if our Adversaries
will no more listen unto the voice of Gods command, magnifying the rites of
his own ordinance for the saving health of his chosen; yet do we wish that
they would behold his powerful hand of justice, in taking vengeance upon them
who have profaned those sanctified elements, (which our Adversaries call common
bread,) by fearful and memorable examples: the first in Fuit minister

CHAP. III. Of the Reservation of the Eucharist.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
As concerning Reservation of the Sacrament: whereas according to our
Adversaries doctrine, M. Willet in his Synopsis, page 466. intemed.
It is no Sacrament unless it be received, the contrary was so plainly
taught and practiced, even in the more ancient times of S. Chrysostom,

although it be kept two or three days, and then given unto the sick, it does
not lose the property of a Sacrament. So that the state of the question, being

is participation, is neglected.
strictly examined, is not so much whether, as wherefore this Sacrament may be
reserved.

2 For the Protestants, defining sacramental actions by their ends, say, that
it is so far only to be esteemed a Sacrament, as it is intended to be
(according to Christ his institution) distributed and eaten in remembrance of
his death and passion. The Romanists reserve it for ends by them newly devised.
It now belongs unto us to discuss this question with that combination of
breuity and perspicuitie, which we have always intended. And to this purpose
to know in the second place,

What were the justifiable causes of Reservation of the Eucharist in the days
of antiquity.
SECT. 2.

Because of the imminent dangers in the days of hot persecution of the
Church, (says their own Durantus) the faithful could not fitly or freely
assemble to the participation of the Sacrament; therefore they sometime took
the Eucharist, and carried it home to their own houses, and so to others who
were detained by necessity. And we doubt not but the Sacraments publicly
consecrated by Gods minister, and sent from the table of the Lord to faithful
Christians, who (although they be absent in body, yet are present in spirit,)
do equiualently communicate; because the Eucharist which is reserved unto this
end, is also preserved in the sanctified use of taking and cating, ordained in
the first institution, especially being thus privileged by necessity, through
sickness or persecution, or such like extremity. And when it was reseiued for
one day or two, with a purpose to be distributed unto the communicants the next
day See Chrysostom. ad Innocentium.
assembled, it is not to be called a change, but a continuance of the first
ordination in the sacramental use.

4 Whatsoever other use it is that can be objected, it may lawfully (as we
think) be abrogated, because Christ (as S. Dominus panem, quem Discipulis
dahat, and dicebat, [Accipite, edrte] non distulit, nec seruari ius^t in

Clemens cautelously commanded, that no more should be provided then was
sufficient for the present use of the people; and if there happened to be any
remainders, the Ministers should diligently consume them. But because some
ancient practices which are void of divine proofs have been thus urged against
us by the Apologists, who seek hereby to express their zeal unto antiquity,
it may not be deemed a question impertinent, to ask and try

Whether the Romanists have not willingly abrogated those rites of Reservation,
which notwithstanding they have, in pretext of antiquity, so vehemently
objected.
SECT. 3.
5 Most of the Catalogue of testimonies, which either these obiectors, or their
learned Cardinal did urge and press, thereby to brand Protestants with a note
of insolent presumption, for derogating from the custom and practice of some
ancient times, were indeed such whereof our Adversaries themselves have
confessed, saying: That custom of conueying the Sacrament home unto (...)

wash my feet. Jesus answered, and said, If I wash thee not, thou shall have no

pass from the use of the sacramental matter unto

CHAP. IIII. The mixture of water with wine in the Eucharist.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
As concerning the mingling of water with wine in the Chalice, before
consecration of the Sacrament, it is so abundantly testified by the Fathers

Cyprian was greatly ouerseene in making it a matter so necessary, in
celebration of the Lords Supper, to have water mingled with wine, which was at
that time no doubt, common to mo then to him: M. Cartwright likewise
acknowledges that M. Cartwright alleged in M. Whitgifts foresaid defense.
page 525. fine.
in the mingling of water with wine, a necessary and great mystery was
placed, as may appear (says he) both by Iustine Martyr and Cyprian: and M.
Jewel speaking of this mixture, confesses in like manner, saying, M. Jewel
in his Reply, page 34. paulo ante med.
Indeed S. Cyprian and certain old Fathers, spoke of it, and forced it much.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL. Of the State of the question.
SECT. 1.
IF the question were only concerning the mixture of wine with water in the
Eucharist, it would not require much dispute, because this may be held by us a
matter Res est indifferens. ^^mnit. part. 2. in Exam. de M^ssa. cap. 7. can. 9.
indifferent: but now that it carries with it an opinion of B. Whitgift
saying, That makes it a necessary matter. M. Cartwright, that a necessity is
placed in it. B. Jewel, that they forced it too much.
necessity, and that upon a presumption of a mystery: as namely the mystery
of repenting, the issuing of water and blood out of Christ's side or Cyprian,
Pope Iuli^s, and others, which if our adversaries should allow, they must
renounce their Transubst antiation of wine into Christ's blood, except they
would admit likewise another of water into the people.
the union between Christ and his people; or Niceph. lib. 18. cap. 23. which
has no congruitie with the thing, that is, Christ's passion, wherein they were
arguments only of humanity.
the expressing of the two natures of Christ; this is that which our Authors,
Bishop Whitgift, Bishop Jewel, and M. Cartwright have reproved.

2 Which point of mystical necessity is defended by some (albeit Necessarium
esse vt aqua vino misceatur in Calice, vt sit Sacramentum, pauciss^^i Catholici
affirmant. Bellar. lib. 4. de E^char. cap. 10. Porro.
very few Catholics, says their Cardinal Bellarmine,) wherefore we are
ready to manifest our contrary doctrine by the testimonies, we say not, of
Protestants (lest they may be suspected partial unto their own party,) but
of the Romish Schools, as well ancient as modern: and first we examine,

Whether the exception taken by Protestants be justifiable or no.
SECT. 2.
3 It is the express conclusion of their former School, to affirm, that
Aquae mixtio non est de necessitate Sacramenti. Aquin^^ part. 3. q. 74. art. 7.
the mixture of water with wine, is not necessarily belonging to the nature of
this Sacrament: and Consecratio valida est cum solo vino Tollet. Ies. lib. 2.
Instr^^. Sac^ed. cap. 25.. Ru^sus. Mayor pars Theologorum docet, non esse aquam
de necessitat^ Sacramenti. Bellarm. lib. 4. d^ Euchar. cap. 11.. Quinto. And
Durantus de Ritibus, lib 2. cap. 27. number. 6.
by common consent the Romish Divines (as Cardinal Bellarmine witnesses) are
of the same judgment. Which does aduersly thwart that opinion which has bin
now taxed by Protestants, because by those mystical representations, there is
attributed a necessity of water, for the perfection of this Sacrament. In so
much that our great Adversary has no other shadow to hide this blemish with,
then to say, that Opinio illa, quod attinet ad modum loquendi, S. Cypriani,
lib. 2. epist. 3. quod ad ^em attin^t, non est Catholicae Ecclesiae, fortasse
etiam nec S. Cypriani: nam, vt supra diximus, mayor part Theo^ogorum do^^t,
aquam non esse de necessitate Sacramenti. Bellar. ib. And therefore they urge
commonly only necessitatem praecepti: which precept we find not in holy
Scripture. See hereafter in the last Section of this Chapter.
peradventure Cyprian (there is the same reason in others) had no such meaning,
or howsoever, yet is not that meaning Catholic.

4 Whereby me may perceive, that the Apologists have showed themselves rather
prompt, then prudent obiectors, by preiudicating the wisdom and integrity of
Protestants, in that wherein they stand justifiable by a cloud of witnesses,
even of their own Romish Schools. But they are too willing to be contentious:
who proceed.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Ad^e but now hereto, that the Armenians being the first we read of, that
denied the mixture, ^ffirming (with our Adversaries) that only wine was to be
used, were therefore specially condemned of error, as witnesses Theophylact in
loan cap 19. mentioning the water and blood which issued from Christ's side,
says, Confundantur Armenij qui non admiscent in mysterijs aquam vin^, non ^nim
^r^du^^ vt videtur, quod aqua ex latere egressasit.
Theophylact.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 3.
5 We will first reason, and then give our Reader leave to wonder at these men's
wits, who seek by such odd observations to draw Protestants within the
compass of an heresy. For the Armenians were not judged heretics for not
mixing water with wine in the Eucharist, but only for their reason of not
mixing, which was heretical. Which was (as our greatest Adversary has truly
confessed) Non defuerunt, qui solum vinum offerendum censerent: ij fuerunt
Armeni, vt Patres Trullani Concilij affirmant, Can. 32 Causam autem cur Armeni
in ^am sententiam desc^derint, resert Nicephorus lib. 18. -- vbi scribit.
Armenos non miscere aquam vino in sacrificio, ne significare videantur vnionem
duarum naturarum in Christo, quam ipsi non credunt. Bella^m. lib. 4. d^ Euchar.
cap. 10.. Non defuerunt. Or else let us suppose with Theophylact, that it was
because they denied that water issued out of Christ's side.
lest that thereby they might seem to confess the union of the two natures of
Christ; which is a necessary article of Christian faith. If a man shall refuse
to take the Kings coin, upon an opinion that he thinks him not to be a lawful
King, he is justly censured by every one to be traitorous; yet not for refusing
to take the Kings coin, but for his reason of that refusal: so is the former
case.

6 Or (that we may approach nearer to our Adversaries) knowing that the L^^
Sermon. 40. Quadrages.
Manichees did heretically celebrate the Eucharist only in one kind, the
bread, but the wine they did not allow, because they imagined wine to have been
created by an evil spirit; and were therefore anciently condemned for
heretics. Would now the Apologists hold it conscionable in Protestants to
accuse the Romanists of that heresy of the Manichees, because they distribute
not the Eucharist in both the elements, bread and wine? Nay, would they not
rather reject this accusation as altogether injurious, saying, it was not the
Manichees abstinence from the wine, but the reason of that forbearance which
was judged heretical? Yet so frivolous and uncircumspect have the Apologists
been, that they cannot reckon Protestants among the Armenians, except they will
likewise impound their own Romanists among the Manichees. And this might serve
for an answer unto their next instance, which follows.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And the Fathers of the sixth Council Council. 6. Constantinop. can. 32. says:
No^imus quod in Armenianorum regione vinum tantum in sacra mensa offerunt aquam
illi non miscentes, qui sacrificium incruentum peragunt: which their usage,
that Council there condemns, saying there further against it: Nam and
Iacobus Domini nostri Jesus Christi srater, etc. and Ba^ilius Caesariae
Archiepiscopus etc. mystico nobis in scripto tradito sacrificio, ita peragendum
in sacro mysterio ex aqua and vino sacrum poculum ediderunt.

SECT. 2.
7 In obiecting the Council of This the Apologists pretend, propounding this
Council as of authority enough to confute vt, which is rejected, viz.
Constantinople, they bewray not so much subtlety, as partiality, seeking to
bind us to the authority of that Synod which they themselves contemn, so
far as it condemned their Pope Damn^sse quidem Honorium sed ex falsa
informatione, ac promde errasse. Bellarm. lib. 4. de Pont. ^. 11.. Quodsi, and.

Honorius of heresy. Again, that Greek Council prescribed times of
consecrating and celebrating the Eucharist: This Canon (says their In omnibus

sancto Annunciationis die, fiat sacrum praesanctifica^orum ministerium. Council.

Surius) the West (meaning the Roman) Church does not observe: and why?
because the Grecians (says he) have diverse peculiar rites, which are not
allowable.

8 Again, the same Council determines thus, Quoniam intelleximus in
Romanorum ciuita^e in sanctis Quadragefimae ieiunijs in eius Sabbatis ieiunari,
praeter Ecclesiasticam trad^tam consequentiam: sanctae Synodo visum est vt in
Romanorum quoque Ecclesia inconc^sse vires habeat Canon, qui di^it, Si quis
Clericus inuentus fuerit in sancto Dominico vel Sabbato ieiunans, praeter vnum
and solum, deponatur, sin autem La^cus segregetur. Can. 55.
Because we understand that in the Church of Rome there is an use of fasting
upon Saturdayes (the Jews Sabbath) contrary unto the Ecclesiastical order,
it seems good unto the holy Synod, that in the Roman Church also this Canon
be in force, etc. Herein taking authority to reform the Church of Rome. Is it
possible that the Romanists should accord unto this Canon? Let one speak for
all his fellows: This Canon (says their Hic quoque Canon, qui Matrem omnium
Ecclesiarum Romanam Ecclesiam reprehendit non recipitut: nam tametsi hic
c^tatur Canon Apostolicus 65. (in margin Concilij) attamen certum est,
quemadmodum Epiphanius quoque dicit, posse sancto proposito omnibus diebus

qui (vt idem Epiphanius testis est) ^o die ^eiun aba^t in inuidi^m Dei
sudaeorum, qui Sabbato ab omni suo opere quieuisset. Surius ibidem.
Surius) is not received of us; because it reprooueth the Romame Church, the
mother of all Churches. This indeed is a contemning of a Council: when they
reject it, not so much because it did er^e, as lest that they themselves might
seem to have erred; nor this only, but lest their Church might seem in any
thing to be subject to the reproof of other Churches.

9 By this observation our Adversaries are compassed within the horns of a
Dilemma: for if they esteem not the Canons of that Council to be of an
inconcussible and undoubted authority, then is their deduction of an argument
from thence, an artificial delusion: and if they think the authority of that
Council inviolable, (which was, as they say,) Apologists above, and Binius
tom. 3. accounts it to have be n^ anno 608.
a thousand years since, and did make decrees for the express reproof and
reformation of the Church of Rome,) and yet shall disclaim it; their Church
therefore refusing to be reformed, because she is reproved, how shall either
the Romanists be approved for equal disputers, or Rome for the legitimate
Mother Church?

10 Their addition of the Liturgies attributed unto S. James, their own
Cardinal See above lib. 1. cap. 10. at the letter, d.
Bellarmine has already satisfied, rejecting them as feined and corrupted
stuff. Hitherto have we entreated of the necessity of this mixture: we are
further to search out the inconueniencie thereof, and to prove,

That the practice of the Romanists, in the mixture of water with wine in the
Eucharist, is less convenient; by uncontrollable consequences taken from our
Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
11 Knowing first (as our Adversaries themselves do well acknowledge) that In
Sacramentis non solum res, sed etiam verba a Deo determinata esse debent, vt
nihil addere, minuere, mutare liceat. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Sacram. ingenere,
cap. 21. and Mutare materiam Sacramentorum grave, sacrilegium est. Ibidem.
both the matter and words of every Sacrament must be instituted and ordained
by God, and are not alterable by man, either by addition or diminution; and
that also Cum non habeatur ex Scriptura: conijciatur tamen ex hoc, quod de

this practice of the mixture of water cannot be read of in all Scriptures, or
found in the first institution of this Sacrament: we lay this for the
foundation of our buildings, and line of all our directions. Yet because our
Adversaries do commonly (although indiscreetly) reject such arguments which are
taken negatiuely from Scripture, they must be put in mind of the same kind of
argument, used in the like question by Pope Julius; who therefore condemned
diverse abuses in the Eucharist, viz. the using of Audiuimus quosdam
schismatica ambitione detentos contra diuinos ordines and Apostolicas
institutiones lac pro vino in diuinis officijs dedicare: alios autem intinctam
Eucharistiam populo pro complemento communionis po^^igere, quosdam etiam

milk in stead of wine, and wringing in of the grape, and sopping of the
bread, as contrary to the Euangelical truth, and Ecclesiastical custom:
which (says he) is easily proved from the sentence of truth, (meaning Christ)
from whom these Sacraments proceeded. For when as Christ did commend this
Sacrament unto his Disciples, he gave not milk, but only bread and wine; for
we read in the Evangelists, [Iesus took bread, and the Cup, etc.] So manifest
and evident is the example of truth. Neither do we find in the Gospel that he
sopped in the bread, for he commended the bread and Chalice severally unto
them. Therefore must our Adversaries think Protestants not pardonable only,
but also commendable, if they use the same reason against the mixture of water,
which their Pope Julius has enforced against mingling of bread: even because
they are not agreeable unto the express form of the first institution
delivered in the Gospel.

12 Again, this Sacrament is a type and sign of Christ's death, wherein as is
confessed, the Dicendum est sine dubio, in passione Christi sanguinem and aquam
impermixtam exiuisse, and loco separata, tum quia haec significant verba
Iohannis. tum etiam quia non potuisset aliter sanguis ab aqua discerni Suarez
Ies. in Thom. 3. q. 51. Art. 3 alijp. 41.. 1.
blood and water issuing from the side of Christ, were discernably distinct and
separated: which therefore S. August. Tract. 120. in. Ioh.
Augustine calls the fountains of two distinct Sacraments, water in Baptism,
and wine in the Eucharist. For otherwise to apply water and wine, in one
mixture, to this one Sacrrment of the Eucharist, is a great incongruitie and
vnlikelinesse: because these signs, wine and water mingled in this Sacrament,
can no more give a true representation of blood and water, which were
discernably severed in Christ's passion, than mixtion can betoken a separation.

13 Furthermore, in Melchizedechs action, which our Adversaries do think to be
a figure of this Eucharisticall sacrifice, we read only of Euch aristia
figurata erat in vino, quod cum pane protulit Melchizedech. Bellarm. lib. 4. de
Euchar. cap. 1^.. Quarta ratio. Therefore for a figure of water he is glad to
borrow it not from Melchisedech, but from the rock in the wilderness.

bread and wine, without any note of mixture of water. It will therefore
concern them to forbear this mixtion, if they will defend the figure of
Melchizedech.

14 We may add hereunto the confessed See ab^ue 2

the Eucharist were not essential without it) but also in respect of precept:

confesses touching Antichrist saying, Whitaker. l. de Antichristo, page 21.
The Fathers, for the most part, thought that Antichrist should be but one man;
but in that, as in many other things, they erred. Concerning the short time of
his persecution or reign, gathered from the Scriptures, M. Fox confesses,

Bellarmine after his books De ^ucharistia, entreats De Missa: and in his
Treatises de Romano Pontifice, does in the third book handle the question of
Antichrist.
Schools, their Altars and Sacrifice should have been mentioned: but here (we
know not how) the question of Antichrist, (who is known to be an intruder,)
does preposterously usurp the place. In whom these Apologists will have two
points principally observed, viz. the singularity of his person, one man; and
the shortness of his reigning, three years and an half.

2 Which two observations their ^x hoc habemus secundum argumentum, Pontificem

Cardinal has urged as two arguments to prove, that no Pope as yet has been
that Antichrist. And to the same purpose have the Apologists objected, in this
case, the acknowledged testimonies of Fathers, no less ignorantly then they
would have them seem to have been by Protestants insolently rejected. For we
can show,

That the opinions of the Fathers in their expositions of prophecies, which
were to be fulfilled after their times, may be refused, without any derogation
from their judgment in other doctrines: which is proved by the confessions of
our learned Adversaries.

before it be fulfilled: but when the event thereof comes, it becomes
manifest. Of which kind the same Jesuit did perceive those predictions to be,
which do directly concern the coming of Antichrist.

second argument, for delivering of the Popedom from the suspicion of the
prophesied Antichristianity: but he is found defective in his principal
foundations. The chiefest is taken out of the Gospel of S. John. 5. 43: I

received me, if another shall come in his own name, him will you hear.] Which
words the Protestants do expound (says their Veritas est, Antichristum esse

singular one: which exposition is repugnant unto the ancient Fathers, and the
text it self, where it is said by opposition [I,] and [an other:] and of that
other, that he shall come in his own name, betokening some singular one. Thus
has one Cardinal, and sometime a Jesuit, oppugned the exposition of
Protestants: but yet another of that order, and of high esteem, even
Maldonate, (notwithstanding the objected Commentaries of Fathers,) is brought
from the light of the text itself, to acknowledge, that Omnes reteres Authors

in these words [if any,] the word [any] is generally taken to signify not

preferreany before himself: and in like manner is the confirmation used by the
same Cardinal, confuted by others of the same Alij Prophetae venient nomine

11 Next he proceeds to prove the singular person of Antichrist from a Greek
particle*, as where Antichrist 2 Thessalonians. 2. is called Secundus locus in 2 Thessalonians. 2. Tunc reuclabitur (...), ille homo peccati; and (...)* ill^ filius
perditionis: Graeci contrahunt significationem ad vnam rem certam, vt (...)

Bellar. lib. 3. de Pont. cap. 2.. Secundus locus.
the man of sin, and the child of perdition, signifying (says he) one
certain and individual person: and then (as though this observation derived
from the Greek particle were a point of learning, and of singular moment,) he
in a manner insulteth against Protestants for their ignorance herein: never
considering that by what argument, they would free their Popes in their
personal succession from the title of Antichrist, by the same they mainly
overthrow that which they think to be the very bulwark of all Popedom, even
their succession from S. Peter; as thus, Matthew. 16. 18 (...). super hanc ipsam
petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam.
Matthew. 16. 18. in Greek [(...), that is, upon this [the] rock will I build
my Church.] This is a divine basis, but now mark their discant upon other
words: Pronomen, hanc, refertur ad Petrum. Bellar. lib. 1. de P^nt. cap. 10.
Tibi, exprimit persona^ singulare^, and Tu, and filius Ionae, etc. Maldon. Ies.
com. in Math 16. and Bellar. ibid. Staplet. de dect* cap. 3. and 5.
these Pronounes [this,] and [thou,] and [to thee,] do all express (say they)
the singular person of Peter only, which is true; but what therefore? Summus
Pontifex cum tota^ Ecclesia^ docet in his quae ad fidem pertinent, ^ulla causa

Bellar. li. 4. de Romans Pont. cap. ^.. Altera expositio.
therefore the Pope (say they) cannot err in faith, as is evident from the
promise of Christ unto S. Peter, where it is said to S. Peter: [I have prayed
for thee, etc.] and [Thou art the Rock,] expressing one certain person, which
was S. Peter: and therefore doubtless do the same privileges descend unto
succeeding Popes.

12 Let them now compare these their own consequents: [the] spoken of
Antichrist, is a particle of the singular number, and therefore must signify
one individual man, and no succession of persons: [the] spoken of Peter Multi
seductores exierunt in mundum, qui non confitentur Iesum venisse in carnem, hic
est seductor and (...) ex bono thesauro cordis, etc. Mat. 12. 35. Non in solo
pane (...) (...). Iuc. 44. Vt perfectus sit (...). 2. I^m. 3. 17. So also his
other reason following.
, does not only betoken S. Peter, but also the Pope, and the whole succession
of that order. From the first [the] they infer that Antichrist is but one,
and therefore Popes, which are in succession many, are not that Antichrist:
from the second [the] they argue, that it was spoken only unto S. Peter, and
infer that every Pope is successively that Rock and Vicar of Christ. By
which contradiction taken from the same particle [the,] our Adversaries are
co^pellable either to grant an Antichrist by succession, or else to deny a
sucession in Popedom. Howsoever, their observation of [^, that is, the] is
confuted by many ^ Scriptures, especially in the terms of Antiochus figuram
gerebat Antichrists: sed Antiochus erat persona singulatis. Bellar. quo supra;
is confuted by a like example: Vniuersa solennitas agni Paschalis expressam
figura^ praetulit Christi Domini. Peter. in Exodus cap. 12. Disp. 4. in princip.
So the high Priest is thus mentioned every where in Scripture, The high Priest,
was one, but by succession many, and yet was (a^ none can deny) a figure of
Christ. Ac^sta Ies. de Christo reuelat. lib. 4. cap. 3. proves out of many
^athers. 1 Ioh. 4 3. Omnis spiritus qui soluit Iesum, ex Deo non est, and hic
est Antichristus de quo audistis, quoniam venit, and nunc ^am in mundo est.
Here (...). Bellarmine his answer, but that Antichrist was then in the world,
non in persona sua, sed in praecursoribus, does but teach us that such
sentences are not always to be literally expounded.
the paschall Lamb, and the high Priest; not signifying either one individual
Lamb, or any one singular high Priest, but the whole body of succession of
the chief Priest. So Dan. 2. 38. Daniel says unto Nabuchodonosor, Dan. 2. 38.
Tu es caput aureum.] hoc est, caput aureum statuae te designat, regnumque tuum.
Pintus in hunc locum. Where Tu, must necessarily signify in one the succession
of many, even as long as the kingdom of Babel continued: for it follows in
the next verse, Et post te consurget regnum aliud, that is, the kingdom of the
Medes and Persians, as all Auth^^s without exception teach: and yet the phrase
is post te, not post illud; so that in the person the kingdom is signified.
See Dan. 11. 18.
Thou art [the] golden head, that is, (as their own Author confesses) thy
kingdom; where, in the name of but one, the succession of all the Emperors of
Babylon is comprised.

13 Hitherto therefore it does not appear, but as when we say, the Turk is the
Tyrant of the East, or when they affirm, that the Pope is the universal
Bishop of the West, that neither we in the name Turk (a word of the singular
number,) nor they in the name Pope, do understand any singular one Turk a
tyrant, or any Pope a supreme Bishop, but the successiue hierarchy and
monarchy in both. So by the singular name of Antichrist may be interpreted a
collectiue or successiue government of many singular persons, who (as diverse
members make one perfect and consummate body) do exercise one and the same
Antichristian jurisdiction: concerning which, the next question will be,

Whether Antichrist be already come: determined by the judgment of our
learned Adversaries, from the consideration of the Roman Empire.

former would entitle Rome to be the seat of Antichrist; the other, to avoid
that scandal, do place his seat in the City and Temple of Jerusalem erit

Pintus finds it prophesied of that City, Esa. 25. that it shall never be
builded again: as for the City now being, it stands not (says he) in his
ancient place: adding a memorable story which he also reports, as namely, how
that when Imperator Iulianus cum a fide de^ecisset, nihilque ei esset
antiquius, quam religionem Christianam labefactare, dedit Iudaeis pecuniarum
and artificum magnam copiam, vt in despectum Christi and ludibrium antiquam
vrbem renouarent. At Deus compressit nefarios illos conatus: nam cum Iudaei
coepissent nudare fundamenta, multamque hausissent terram, magnus exiuit ignis,

Julian the Apostata sought, to the contempt of Christ, and overthrow of
Christianity, for to enable the Jews to reedifie that City, at the beginning
of the work a sudden fire issued out of the earth, and consumed the workmen:
and at last concludes both out of Fathers and Scriptures, that the Temple
shall never be restored again. Their Cardinal indeed promises to prove (as
he says) out of Scriptures, that Venio nunc ad Scripturas, quibus probatur
sedem Antichristi Jerusalem esse futuram, non Romam. Prima est cap. 11. Apoc.
vbi Johannes dicit Henoc and Heliam pugnatu^os cum Antichristo in Jerusalem,

Venio. The answer is easy, Christ is said to be crucified in his members, as
he spoke to Saul.
Jerusalem must be the Antichristian seat, and first out of Apoc. 11: but (if

(being altogether mystical) must be expounded spiritually. As for the

no man is ignorant (says their Jesuit Ribera,) that this is not to be

Fathers agree, and rather in the Church then in Jerusalem, S. Jerome judges
to be more true. The next question is

Where the prophesied place of Antichrist must be, and whether at Rome: from
the judgment of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 8.
20 The only Cities that are found in Authors to be the destinate seats of
Antichrist, are but these two, Jerusalem and Rome: now therefore seeing
Jerusalem, which they set in our light, is thus removed, we may more easily
see Rome, which, in the judgment of Protestants, is Antichrists proper seat.
This opinion is grounded upon that Scripture Revel. 17. 19. wherein the throne
of the whore is described by seven mountains, whereon the woman sits; and
is further particularized by the name of Babylon the great. Revel. 18. 2.
Hereupon Protestants have made bold to instile Rome the seat of Antichrist,
and not only that old Rome in the days of the heathenish persecuting
Emperors, but Rome as it is to be considered in the later ages of the world:
and are for so expounding these Scriptures, noted by the The Heretics blinded
with extreme malice against ye church of Rome, interpret the seven hills,
Apoc. 17. literally, to persuade the simple that Rome is the seat of
Antichrist. Rhemish Annot. upon that place, Apoc. 17. verse 9. And again. The
Protestants foolishly expound it of Rome. ver. 6.
Romanists, to be men blinded with malice against the Church of Rome, foolish,
and (by reason of their want of judgment) altogether Babylon being not applied
to the state of the Church, but to the state of the persecuting Emperors and
afflicted Christians, which by Christ's power (as was prophesied of) has been

circumstance is further confirmed by that which follows, showing

That the extent of the now usurped Papal power and Jurisdiction in temporal
things, above all power Imperial which ever has been in the world, is a mark
of Antichrist: proved from the confessions of our Adversaries.

st^rrop, serve his table with the first dish, to carry him upon his
shoulders, and upon whose neck he has set his feet, may be thought a
sensible character of Antichrist; then doubtless (as the Moon in the full)
will his face appear by the height of his temporal usurpation, when we shall
understand that he challenges more then ever Monarch in the world either did
enjoy, or could possibly hope for.

25 To this purpose S. Gregory has given us this proposition: Antichristus

Antichrist (says he) when he comes, shall obtain the chiefest powers of
this world, and by a double error endeavor to draw unto him the hearts of men.
Whether this have been by Popes abundantly fulfilled, may appear by the
absolute profession of the now Romish Church, wherein two of their Popes
challenge [Ecce duo gladij] In Ecclesia scilicet, cum Apostoli loquetentur: non

Doctors: we are confirmed in our judgment, to think that the Popes usurped
authority does exceed all temporal power that any one, yea, or many Monarchs
of the earth were ever capable of. Which is so perfect a demonstration of the
Antichristian power, as that their own Jesuit has observed, that Tantam
potentiam consequetur Antichristus, and tam long lateque dominatum and
imper^um suum extendet, vt maximus, qui fuerunt ante ipsum Monarcha futurus.
Salmeron Ies. Tom. 15.
Antichrists dominion shall extend it self further then any Monarchy that was
before him.

26 Upon these premises must follow our intended conclusion, which we choose
rather to deliver from our Adversaries confession, then from our own
collection. Their Ple^^que tunc Hildebrandum Antichristum esse praedicant,
Titulo Christi, inquiunt, Antichristi negotium agitat: in Babylone, in t^mplo
Dei sedet, supra omne id quod col^tur, and extollitur qu^si Deus sit: se errare

his Iesuitism^, tract. de. Antichristo.
Auentinus witnesses, that when Pope Gregory the seventh, alias Hildebrand,
took upon him to challenge that power (above mentioned) h of an universal
right of deposing Emperors, and disposing of all temperall kingdoms, most did
preach that Hildebrand under the title of Christ did play the part of
Antichrist: when all good, just, and ingenuous men saw that then began the
kingdom of Antichrist. Then indeed, it was most discernable, and almost
palpable in his whole body, although before that time possibly his horns and
head did only appear by other figures. Whereunto we proceed, delivering

A description of Antichrist by sower confessed properties:
(...)

(...)tuleth himself the servant of servants, when he seeks to be Lord of
Lords. His tenor of them in Indulgences, is, Fili mi, Apostolicam
benedictionem, that is, blessing: but in deposing of Princes it is, (...) above
(...). and 11.
to root out nations: far differing from the Lamb Jesus, who is confessed
Regia potestas non erat Christo necessaria, sed mutilis plane and superflua^
nam finis aduentus eius erat redemptio humani generis, ad quam potestas Regia
non erat necessaria, sed sola spiritualis. Bellarm. lib. 5. de R^m Pont. ^ap.
4. Potestatem pa^iendi res aduersas Christus sibi ac suis elegit. -- Intimating
that the Pope, Potestatem faciendi res animose suscepit. Sanderus lib. 2 de
Clauib. David. cap. 13.
not to have undertaken any regal power. And when he treads under his feet
the necks of Monarchs, he is far unlike the first Pope (if we may so term
him) S. Peter, who Petrus Ethnicorum Iudex non erat, sed e contra in omnibus
causis ciuilibus non min^s quim caeteri homines illi^ subijciebabatur. (...) de

was (as themselves confess) subject unto heathen governors, in all temporal
causes, as much as other men. And if any can show us, that ever there was any
Monarch that was more Lambish in profession, and in practice more Dragonish
then the Pope, then let not the note of Antichristianitie be thought to be
proper unto him.

32 If Popedom be a degree of spiritual perfection, not dissoluing the vow of
poverty, then behold a pattern of hypocrisy: otherwise could not their own
Camera Apostolica assimilatur mari, in quod intrant omnia flumina, and non

adds, that Fredericus a Gregorio nono excommunicatus, centum millibus auri

lextus Cardin^les aliquot ditiores vene^o tollendos constituit, vt eorum opibus

noster.
Authors have compared the chamber of the Roman See unto the Sea, whereinto
floods of gold do flow: noting, among their Popes, one to have taken for an
absolution, an hundred thousand ounces of gold; another to have murdered
diverse Cardinals, to enrich himself with their treasures; a third to have
left in the treasury five and twenty thousand millions of ducats; a fourth to
have gathered (we forbear to have mentioned their tolles from the stews) for
Indulgences, an hundred thousand florens, out of a Province of one kingdom, in
a short time; a fifth was able at one time to leese out of his Myter, a Clemens

Jewel worth six thousand crowns, glorying in a Myter beset with all kinds of

33 And how may we not suspect that the Popes themselves can pretend
godliness, eue^ in their extreme wickedness, seeing the Glossers are
authorized to record the memories of every Pope, though never so graceless,
(as was their John 12, described by themselves to have been a Johannes 12. erat
venator lubricus and incorrigibilis. Vict. relect. 2. prop. 23. ab adolescentia
omni turpitudine and probris contaminatus -- sceletatissimus vel monstrum

every one thus; Dudum bonae memoriae Bonifacius Papa octauus, etc.] Extrauag.
lib. 5. cap. Dudum. Thus did Benedict the ninth inst^^e Boniface the eight:
whereupon the Gloss is driven to question thus: Sed quaero, quidam Papa ex
actionibus impijs, simonijs, turpiloquijs Ecclesiam foedauit, vt hic, numquid
propter d^ctos actus dici potest malae memoriae? And then resolves, Dico quod
non, quia respici debet non ad id quod fecit, sed ad id quod facere decuit
Which he proves o^t of the canon laws. Then, Vnde malus praelatus, si non
habeat diadema sanctitatis, habet tamen diadema dignitatis, quae non de se
peccauit, licet persona cui dignitas inerat, male egerit, propter quod dignitas
sibi coniuncta infecta erat. -- Item Praelatus, etsi non sit bonus, tamen pro
bono ponitur. Again, which follows, Praelatus non dicitu^ bonae memoriae
ratione suppositi sed ratione dignitatis, quae non de se peccauit, nec delictum
personae redundat in damnum Ecclesiae. Glossa in eum loc^m: authorized by Pope
Gregory the 13. By which reason leroboam, Pilate, Judas, and who not, have
deserved the record of bonae memoriae.
Pope of good or godly memory? because (say they) we herein respect not what
they did, but what it became them to have done. By which reason, like honor of
bonae memoriae belongs unto Jeroboam among the Kings, Balaam among the
Prophets, Judas among the Apostles.

34 Our conclusion is, that if they can imagine any State in the world to be
but capable of the height of like hypocrisy by dissimulation of continency in
luxuriousness; of humility in pride, of love in malice, of poverty in excess,
and of sanctity in plots and practices of all mischief, as their own
histories have discovered in their Popes: then shall we have less cause to
suspect the now Popedom to be guilty of Antichristian hypocrisy. There
follows,

A third character of Antichrist which is a confessed spiritual pride.
SECT. 13.
35 Where S. Paul prophecieth of Antichrist, that he shall sit in the Temple of
God: S. De Antichristo rectius putant Latin dici, sicut in Greco [In templu^

velut amicus. August. lib. 20. de Ci^it. Dei, cap. 19. Tom. 5.
Augustine from the Greek expounds it to signify, that Antichrist shall sit
in place and stead of the whole Church. Now what esteem of their Pope the
Romanists at this day do make with full consent, may appear by their own
Aphorisms, saying, that Pontificis est congregare co^cilium. Bellarm. lib. 1.

having all the laws in the chest of his breast; and therefore to be
acknowledged to be the supreme Judge in all causes belonging unto faith or
manners. Which is indeed to make the Pope an Epitome of the universal Church
of Christ: whom they instile, as with his proper title, by the name of the Vnus

Gregory to be altogether See above, lib 1. cap 2. Sect. 32.

co^^ue^. Sed absit haec stultitia, absit haec leuitas ab omnibus meis. Greg.
lib. 6. Epist. cap. 188.
if that universal Bishop shall fall into heresy, then (which God forbid)
must the universal Church with him apostate from the faith.

36 This property of spiritual jurisdiction, in defining spiritual causes in
this manner, being not yet communicable with any earthly majesty, nor
attributed unto any Pastor of the Church, excepting only to the Popes of
aftertimes, does bewray another property of our personal description: how much
the rather when it is known and confessed, that Quod omnes mortales
cuiuscunque sint dignitatis and praeeminentiae, cum primum in conspectum
Pontificis adueniunt, distantibus spacijs, te^ debeant ante ilum genu flectere,

acknowledge in the Pope that singular (...), or contrariety against Christ; and
consequently how may not the Romish professors be thought to be enthralled in
Antichristian tyranny? From the sight of Antichrist we are called to behold
their Altars.

CHAP. VI. Of Altars.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
As concerning Altars and Sacrifice, (which as Doctor Reynolds gr^^^eth D.
Rainolds in his conference with M. Heart, page 552. fine.
are linked by nature in relation and mutual dependence one of other; and
first concerning Altars:) Peter Martyr reproves the ancient Fathers, saying,
Peter Martyr in his Common places in English, part. 4. page 225. b. post med.

lively Temples of Christ. And yet further against Optatus: Peter Martyr abidem.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL. Delivering the right state of the question.
SECT. 1.
WHen our Adversaries speak of an Altar, they do not understand necessarily an
Neque obstat quod aliquando sine altari oblatum est sacrficium: nam non
disputamus hic de Altari lapideo, sed id omne vocam' altar, vbi recipitur
victima per verba consecrationis effecta. Bellar. l. 1. de Missa, ca. vlt..
Secundo in.
artificial Altar; howsoever, we cannot dislike the sentence of Doctor
Reynolds, concerning the mutual relation and dependence between an Altar and
a Sacrifice: but grant that Altar does as naturally and necessarily infer a
Sacrifice, as a shrine does a Saint, a father a son: yet so, as to
distinguish when these things are properly, and when improperly so called;
knowing that the table of the Lord being called improperly an Altar, can no
more conclude a Sacrifice properly understood, then when as S. Paul calls
Titus his son according to the faith (which is improperly) a man may contend
that S. Paul was his proper and natural Father, which is, according to the
flesh. Therefore has their Cardinal Bellarmine said truly, viz. Sacrificium
and sacerdotium relata sunt, it a vt proprie dictum sacerdotium proprie dicto
sacrificio responde at. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. ^. Idem argumentum
efficitur ab altari. Bellar. ibid. cap. 14.
Sacrifice and Priesthood are relatiues, so that Priesthood properly taken,
has relation unto a Sacrifice it proper signification: otherwise to conclude
from an improper relative to enforce a proper, is as hapless a labor as to
draw a straight sword out of a crooked scaberd. And now we apply this unto the
point in controversy, proving

That the exceptions taken by Protestants are justifiable, and that therein
they accord both with Scripture, and primitive antiquity: proved by the
confessions of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 Their Cardinal Bellarmine has confessed, that there is as mutual and
reciprocal a dependence between Priesthood and Sacrifice, properly taken, as
there is between Altar and Sacrifice: notwithstanding Primi Christiani propter
recentem memoriam Sacerdotij Aaronici, ne viderentur adhuc dur are caeremoniae
ludaicae, abstinuerunt non solum a vocabulo Tepli, sed etiam sacerdotij. Itaque
Apostoli in suis epistolis pro Sacerdotibus, Episcopos and Presbyteros, pro
Templis Ecclesias dicunt: and similiter loquitur Justinius and Ignatius, and
caeteri antiquissimi Patres Deinde, tempore Tertulliani iam statim perspect^
differentia inter Christianos and Iudaeo^, coeperunt Christiani Presbyteros
nominare Sacerdotes, vt patet ex Tertull. and Cyprian. adhuc tamen abstinebant
a vocabulo templi, quia mundus plenus erat templis Idolorum: and vsus obtinuer
at vt nomine Templi intelligeretur locus consecratus ad sacrificia cruenta: in
quo sensu Octauius apud Minutium, and Hieronymus negant Christianos habere
templa. Le'larm. lib. 3. de cul^u Sanct. cap. 4.
the Christians of the primitive Church (says the same Cardinal) did
purposely abstain from the names of Temple, and of Priesthood, even until the
days of Tertullian: (that is, about two hundred years after Christ,) not, as
he does imagine, lest that they might seem to have retained some Jewish
ceremonies, or Temples of heathenish Idols; for so they should as well have
forborne the names of worship and prayer, which terms were commonly used both
of Jews and heathens: but rather lest that the newly converted Christians
might by the name of Temple, Altar, and Priest, conceit some corporal and
real Sacrifice daily to be offered with hands, for expiation of offenses,
different from the only propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ's body offered up
unto God, as an all-sufficient purgation of sin.

3 Which must be thought to have been the condition of those former times,
wherein the Fathers of the primitive Church were condemned by the then Pagans
for want of Altars and Sacrifice: to whom Origin held it sufficient to answer,
saying, that although Christians have not Celsus and aras, and simulachra, and
delubra not a^t defugere quominus fundentur, cum nihil interea videat no^i
quidem pro aris and delubris iustorum esse mentem a qua haud dubie emittuotur
suauiss^mi incensi odores, vota, inquam, and preces ex conscientia puriore.
Origin. contra Celsum, lib. 8. page 756. Et postea: Disquirat igitur quicunque
velit aras istos, quas nuper exposui, and si lubet, cum aris his conferat, quas
intulit Celsus, etc. aperte intelliget illa quidem inanimata, and temporis
processu corruptibilia fore, nostra vero haec in anima immortali permansura
tamdiu, quamdiu rationalis anima, in co voluei it permanere. Ibid. page 757.
Edit. Basil. 1536.
the liuelesse Altars of the Pagans, yet have they the living Altars of
immortal souls. Nay they were then so utterly destitute of sacrificing

4 Now therefore far be it from us, to imagine that the blessed Saints of
those times, who were always pressed and ready to seal the profession of
Christ with their dearest blood, would have endured the brand of Atheism for
want of external Sacrifices and Altars, if they could have then maintained

5 If therefore some Protestants, calling to mind the temperance of the

and Temples (we add, that which we have proved, and from Altars) have misliked
the liberty of succeeding Fathers for alteration of the phrase: they are not
herein to be judged adversaries, but rather zealous emulators and favorers of
true antiquity,

6 Neither yet have they been altogether so opposite unto the alleged Fathers
of aftertimes, as the Apologists, to engender an hatred against them, would
make them appear, because they note in the Fathers a license in the use of
terms only, but no error in doctrine; saying, that Haec consuerudo --

by such custom of speech Optatus gave posterity an occasion of superstition:
directly implying, that the judgment of our ancestors was found in this
matter, and that the error concerning the nature of Altar and Sacrifice,
arising from the common use of such phrases, possessed only their posterity.

middle rank, used against Clemens Alexandrinus, for attributing more to
outward Altars, then to the lively Temples of Christ, if they shall distaste,

Fathers can relish with them: for S. Gemmis Altar distinguitur, and

Cardinal, upon four circumstances, does equally condemn, according to that
Scripture where it is written, Hose. 7. 6.
I will have mercy, and not sacrifice; and who knows not, that there is as
great difference between the stone Temple, and the body of the most
contemptible Christian (although we may not call any true Christian
contemptible) as there is between a matter of man's workmanship, and a subject
of Christ's redemption.

he shall but renew an old infestred superstition of the Jews, who esteemed an

CHAP. VII. Of Sacrifice.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Now as concerning sacrifice, it is affirmed by our learned Adversaries, that
the more ancient Fathers, namely See this affirmed by Calvin hereafter page
145. in the margent, under the letter, ^. at Anno 320.
Athanasius, Ambrose, Austine, Arnobius, etc. erred herein, and so fully, that
their supper is therefore said to have carried the face of a renewed oblation,
imitating over nearely the Jewish manner of sacrificing, etc. that they Calum.
in omnes Pauli epist. in Hebt c 7. verse. 9. pa 924 b.
forged a sacrifice in the Lords Supper without his commandment, and so
adulterated the Supper with adding of Sacrifice: that also the writings of
Irenaeus, Ignatius (who are most ancient) are herein Cent. 2. c 4. col. 63.
line 9. and Cent 2 cap. 10. col. 167. line 17. And see hereafter page 145. in
the margent, under the letter t. and at Anno 90 and 170.
incommodious and dangerous: and that Sebastianus Francus in his epist de
abrogandis in vniuersum omnibus statutis Ecclesiasticis.
presently after the Apostles times, the Supper of our Lord was turned into a
Sacrifice: in so much as some of our Adversaries doubt not to charge the
ancient Fathers even with propitiatory Andreas Christianus lib de opificio
Mislae, page 167. initio, reciting the fathers opinion hereof, says: Dicta
autem patrum nonso^um impetrationem, seletiam intrinsecam quandam vim placandi
innuunt. Origenes hom. 13. in Leu ticum, ait, Isia est c^m^^moratio sola quae
protitium ^acit Deum hominibus. Athanasius in sermon de defunctis apud
Damascenum, ait, Incruent chostia oblatio propitiatio e^t. To which end he
alleges likewise further the particular sayings of Ambrose, Chrysostom,
Augustine, Gregory, Bid, and of the third Council of Brach. And concerning
the Fathers further testimonies for Masle, see more hereafter, tract. 3. sect.
1. in the margent at the letter, t.
sacrifice, and Sacrifice for the dead. So chargeable were the ancient Fathers
no less then we now are, in that great question of Sacrifice.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL. In satisfying for the objected exceptions used by
Protestants, first in general.
SECT. 1.
HEre the obiectors have noted a taxation of errors, but whether it be about
the contention of words, or of doctrine, they have either willingly, or
ignorantly dissembled. For the primitive antiquity (as has been confessed)
did abstain from the name of Priest, and so consequently, of Altars and
Sacrifice, terming them according to the tenor of the new Testament, Elders,
or Bishops, Tables, and Eucharist. In the aftertimes, the Church being then
established in the truth of doctrine, the Fathers might presume to take a
greater liberty of (...)

SECT. 4.
7 The next kind of exception taken by our Centurists, is not of any error of
judgment, but of The Centurists phrase, (...) ^^tato.
danger and incommodiousnesse of speech: by which censure the intention of the
Fathers is rather justified then reproved; because danger has not respect unto
the mind of the writer, but to the weakness of the Reader. And indeed the
Centurists in the objected places do satisfy for themselves, Doctores hu^us
seculi, etsi de oblatione seu sacrificio incruento in Euchatistia Deo fac^endo
nihil habent, tamen quaedam a^bigue and incommode dicta in quibusdam occurrunt,
vt in epist. Ignatij ad Smy^n. Non licet, inquit, sine Episcopo neque ofsetre,
neque sacrificium immolare. Paul^ post: Certe Ignatius ipse de me^ito Christi
fide apprehendendo magis quam de aliqua oblatione seu repraesentatione
sacrificij (sicut ex alijs epistolis colligi potesty loquitur. I. odem modo
Irenaeus videtur loqui incommode. Sed add^nt: Sed Irenaeus in seqq. praesertim
in c. 34. lib. 4. copiose declarat* quod neutiqua^ intelligat oblationem
consectari pa^^s, sed adhuc consecrandi in vsum coenae Domini, and alioqui in
vsum sacerdotum and paupe^um. Centur. 2. col. 4. col. 63. and cap. 10. col.
16^. R^prehea lunt Latinam versione^ Ignatij. in qua Mislae facta est mentio,
vbi nihil simile in Graeci^ reperitur.
saying, that Ignatius and Irenaeus, and the Doctors of that age do not teach
the pretended Sacrifice: answering from the sentences of the same Fathers, unto
the difficulties of ambiguous and incommodious speeches. Which proves that
these obiectors have dealt vnco^scionably, in suggesting unto their Reader an
opposition of doctrine between the Centurists and those Fathers, in so great a
question (as they call it) of Sacrifice, from such places wherein the
Centurists have professed and proved their undoubted accordance.

8 The testimonies following are objected (we think) with the like art, and
therefore deserve the like answer. It suffices us to know that their own
Jesuit cannot perceive all things in Fathers so direct for their Romish
party, when he is forced to answer, that the Fathers purposely spoke of these
things obscurely, Morem fuisle Patrum, vt de rebut fidei cum nondum eslent
aperte satis controuersiae ab Haereticis morae, securius atque simplicius
scriberent and loquerentur, quia putabant se non nisi Catholice ab omnibus
intelligi: and ne mys^erium ^^^dendum infidelibus exponere^t* si in sermonibu^
popularibus sententiam suam nimis claris verbis explic^ssen^. Greg Valent. Ies.
lib. 1. de praesentia Christi in Euchar. cap. 10.
lest the Infidels might take occasion of scoffing at their doctrine; as before
in the question concerning Transubstantiation, he thought it Greg. Valent. Ies.
See above cap. 2. in the question of Transubstantiation.
a brief and simple answer, to tell us, that some Fathers both wrote, and
(which is more) thought inconsiderately of this point. But we pass from the
mooneshine of words, and now declare c If Andreas Christianus (which Author we
find not extant) did attribute such sentence^ unto Origin and others in the
Rom^sh (...), Origin himself may confute him, a^ the very words objected do
manifest, calling it A commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ's death and
sacrifice upon the crosle, as the place it self shows. Otherwise to
a^^nowledge herein a sacrifice of propitiation and remission of sin does not
pre^udice the d^clrine of Protestants, who grant a sacrifice also of
propit^ation really in the thing signified and represented in the Eucharist,
namely, the pre^^ous body of Christ, as it was wounded to death for our
redemption; but not in the elements* ^ which are only symbols and
representative signs of that one only offered Sacrifice. So that the
difference between us and the Romish, is th^^* We hold upon the infallible
substance of Christ crucified, the^ catch at shadows, and rely upon an vnbl^udy
^oast: or, as Saint Chrysostom has distinguished Eagles, viz. such as in this
look up to Christ's body in heaven, from Ravens* namely, such as gaze only
upon the boast. The testimony of Athanasius is taken out of the report of
Damasus (as the Apologi, ^^say) in a book which is counterfeit, as Cardinal
Bellarmine does truly witness, saying, Hunc librum, qui inscribitur Oration de
mortuis, non esse Damasi facile probari potest: prima ratio, quia scribit,
multos Infideles per Christum ab inferno eductos: quod etroneum est, etc.
Bellar. lib. 2. de Purg. cap. 8.


The state of this great question concerning Sacrifice, as it is controuerted
between Protestants and Romanists
SECT. 5.
9 After the contention about the word Sacrifice, which in respect of the
superstitious apprehension of corrupter times has been judged dangerous and
incommodious: we descend to the question of doctrine, concerning the true
nature of a Sacrifice; which is by the Romanists in their Council of I rent
propounded as a doctrine of faith, and is by them defined to be Sacrificium est
vere propitiatorium. Et* Vna eademque est hostia, idem nunc ofterens Sacerdotum
ministerio, qui se^psum obtulit in cruce. Con^il. Tridens. Sess. 22* cap. 2.
the same sacrifice truly propitiatory, now offered by the ministry of the
Priest, which was offered by Christ himself upon the Cross: Sicut non
differunt per se and secundum substantiam corpu^ Christi a corpore in altari
and in cruce: it^ vere and secundum substantiam non differunt immolatio in pane
ab immolatione in altero pane, aut ab immolatione in cruce. Alanus de Euchar.
sacrif. lib. 2. cap. 12.
So fully the same (says their Cardinal,) that as the substance of Christ
which is really in the Host, differs not from the substance of his body in
heaven: so the immolation and sacrificing of him in the forms of bread, and
his sacrificing upon the Cross is the very same. But, Protestants (says the
same our greatest Adversary) although they allow this to be a sacrifice of
thanksgiving, and of divine worship of God; yet do they not esteem it to have
the proper nature of a Sacrifice, but to be so called after a large and
improper manner of speech: in the which large acception Protestants may account
it propitiatory also. So that the controversy is only concerning the proper
and improper signification of terms, and compriseth two questions: first,
whether the Eucharist be a true essential sacrifice; secondly, whether it be
properly propitiatory, and auailable in it self for remission of sins, or
no. Both which, we wish, may be decided by the verdict of ancient Fathers, by
the tenor of Christ's institution, and by the principles of the Romish Church,
and in every of these by the confessions of our learned Adversaries. c Tria
sunt genera sacrificiorum: vnum in Scripturis dicit^^ Holocaustum, quod etiam
(...) and honorarium dici potest, cuius finis est solus Dei cultus and honor.
Alterum dicitur in Scriptura Sacrificium pro peccato, quod etiam propitiatorium
appellatur, cuius finis, praeter Dei cultum, propitiatio irati Dei* and
peccatorum remis^o. Tertium in Scriptura dicitur Pacificum: hoc quoque duplex
est, oblatum ad agendas gratias p^^ beneficio accepto; alterum, quod communi
vocabulo Impetratorium dici potest, cuius finis est impetratio benefici^*

velint esse Sacrificium proprie dictum, sed improprie and largo modo. Nam tota

2. de Missa, cap. 1.. In principio.


The doctrine of Protestants, concerning this question of Sacrifice, is showed
to accord with the profession of ancient Fathers: which is first proved by the
common language and expositions of the Fathers themselves.
SECT. 6.
10 Thereunto the Senate of Fathers do yield their consent, first, by their
tenor of a speech of amplification, saying no more, properly, that Christ is
sacrificed in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, then they have said that in the
Sacrament of Baptisma est passio Christ. Chrysostom. in ^p^st. ad Heb. ^om. 16.
Baptism is Christ's passion: Tingimur in passione Christi. Tert^ll. de
Baptismo.
In Baptism we are dipped in Christ's pas^ion: Videmur cum vidisse, quem
legimus spect ^sle pendentem* and vulnera cius, spiritu scrutante, tractasse.
Ambros. lib. 5. in Luc. cap. 7.
In reading the Gospel we see Christ hanging on the Cross: In Baptismo
crucifigitur in nobis filius Dei. Ambros. de Poenit. lib. 2. cap. 2.
Christ is crucified in us in Baptism: Quotidie nobis agnus occiditur. Hieron.
in 1. Corin. 6.
Christ is the Lamb daily slain unto us. Which manner of speeches they would
never have used, if they had thought their Readers would have ever stretched
such voices unto their highest strain: and therefore must be qualified by that
discreet construction, which even the Romish Gloss long since has
acknowledged in expounding the sentence of S. Gregory, wherein Christ is said
to Licet Christus immortaliter viuens* ^am non moritur, tamen in hoc mysterio
moritur, and eius caro in populi salutem patitur. Greg. Magn. vt citatur per
^ratian. de Consecr. did. 2. Quid sit.

sacrifices in the strict and proper sense; and indeed it were but a Jewish, yea

absurd apprehension, to esteem of the elements of bread and wine, as of the
proper sacrifices of the new Testament.

18 Again, the Fathers entreating of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, have also
frequent use of the word oblation, wherein their Cardinal Patres dicunt
^ucha^^stiam esse Sacrificium se^ obl^tionem, and offerri Deo, etc. Pellar.
ibid.
Bellarmine fixes no little presumption of advantage, confounding the term^s
of oblation and sacrifice: albeit he knew right well that the Fathers, who used
the word sacrifice improperly, did not forbear to apply the word oblation in
the like sense, as their own learned Jesuit witnesses: Secundum Thoma^
oblatio simplex geneticum nomen Oblationis retinens, non est sacrificium. --
Nam quaedam oblatio Graece dicitur (...) quae vox simplicem oblationem
significat, alia dicitur (...) quae proprie de victima seu de sacrificio
dicitur -- Hoc ex rebus ipsis possit declara^i, -- olim en^^ offe rebantur Deo
primitiae, and primogeniti, and alia similia, quae n^n sacrifi abantur. Suarez
Ies. t^m. (...).
Simple oblations, which are offered to be consecrated (such as bread and wine,
before consecration, are acknowledged to be,) do carry but a general name of
sacrifice, according to the Greeks, who distinguish between oblation and
sacrifice, by the words (...) and (...); and answerably unto the rites of the
old law, where we read of first fruits, and of the first borne, and other such
like, which were oblations, but no sacrifices.

19 Whereby we may discern the flat non sequitur of their Cardinals argument,
who would conclude a proper sacrifice from the word oblation: when as he could
not be ignorant that the word oblation was used, where notwithstanding there
was no sacrifice: wherefore he must be further put in mind by another direct
confession of their Jesuit, saying, that Caeremo^ias ab Ecclesia institutas.
ad ornatum huius sacrificij, non sacrificia, sed sacrificalia vocamus, -- q^od^
interdum aliqua ex his caeremonijs sacrificium vocatur, id est ratissimum, and
interpretandum est de sacrificio late sumpto, prout tribuitur (...) actioni and
oblationi sacrae. Suarez Ies. ibid disp. 74.. 3. page 957.
although but rarely, yet sometime those rites, which have been instituted by
the Church (and therefore are not properly sacrifices,) notwithstanding are by
them called sacrifices, but in a more large and common manner of speech, by
which every sacred action may be so termed. This observation gives us just
cause to marvel with what pret^nce our Adversaries can so tie the Fathers to
such a servitude in the use of their phrase of sacrifice (when they speak of
Christ's Sacraments) in a strict and precise sense; and yet they themselves
assume a liberty of calling their own humane rites sacrifices, although in a
more large and common signification. But we shall not need to stand upon these
collections, because

Our Adversaries are answered according to their own demand, by an
observation, which teaches us how to understand the Fathers, and confute all
our opposites.
SECT. 8.
20 Their Cardinal Bellarmine does argue against Protestants thus: Si Patres
existimarent ^ucharistiam solum esse sacramentum, non etiam sacrificium, vt
Aduersarij sentiunt, nulla esset causa cur aliter loquerentur de Eucharistia,
quam de Baptismo: nusquam autem Patres Baptismum vocant Sacrificium; nec dicunt
baptiz are esse sacrificare, vel immolare: praeteres quae causa esset cur
Patres de Sacramento al^ter loqu^rentur, quam Aduersarij nostri loquuntur?
quomodo enim credibile erit veteres Patres in modo loquendi nobiscum; in
sententia cum Aduersarijs conuenisse? Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 15.. Hic
igitur.
If the Fathers had thought that the Eucharist were a Sacrament only, and not
also a sacrifice (meaning properly,) they could not have spoken otherwise of
the Eucharist then of Baptism: but the Fathers (says he) never call Baptism
a sacrifice, or say, that to baptize is to sacrifice. And concludes hereupon,
that the word sacrifice was used of the Fathers in a proper and literal sense:
whereby he does not obscurely grant, that the use of the word sacrifice,
attributed by the ancient Fathers unto the Eucharist, might indeed be
interpreted as taken metaphorically and improperly, if it could be once showed,
that the same Fathers applied the same word sacrifice unto the Sacrament of
Baptism: otherwise their lesuite Suarez would not so vrgently have moved his
Reader principally to In multis Concilijs, vt in Toletano, Brachorensi,
Laodicen. vocatur incruentum sacrificium. -- Solum est obseruandu^ propter
haereticos, qui hic etia^ detorquent ad metaphoram nomen Sacrificium; Sanctos
Patres nun quam vocasse ministerium Baptismi, aut alterius Sacramenti nomine
Sacrificij; cum tamen Sacrificium metaphorice sumptum in ^o conueniat. Cum ergo
Eucharistia^ frequentissime and absolutissime Sacrificium vocant, signum est
co^ proprie de sacrificio loqui. Suarez Ies. tom. 3. disp. 74. Sect. 2. page
952.
observe against heretics (so he calls Protestants,) that the holy Fathers
of ancient times did never call the ministry of Baptism by the name of a
sacrifice, although metaphorically it might be so termed. Therefore (says he)
it is a sign, that when they often call the Eucharist a sacrifice, they name
it so properly.

21 Seeing therefore the parallele of Baptism may give our Adversaries their
demanded satisfaction, we desire them first to consult with S. Augustine, who
expounding that place unto the Heb. 10. [Voluntarie peccantib' nobis, postquam
accepimus scientiam veritatis, non adhuc relinquitur sacrificium p^ope^catis:]
--
Hebr. cap. 10. [vnto them that sin voluntarily, after they have obtained the
knowledge of truth, there remains no host or sacrifice for sin:] says,
that Illud ad Hebraeos qui diligentius pertractant, sic intelligunt, vt non de
sacrificio contribulati per poe^^^entiam cordis accipiendum sit quod dictum est
[non adhuc pro peccatis relinquitur Sacrificium:] sed de sacrificio, de quo
(...) loquebatur Apostolus, id est, holocausto Dominicae passionis, quod eo
tempore o^^ert quisque pro peccatis suis, quo (...) passionis fide dedicatur,
and Christianorum fidelium nomine baptizatus imbuitur, vt hoc significaret
Apostolus [Non posse d^inceps cum, qui peccauerit, iterum baptizando purgati.]
-- ^^tamen illud sacrificium, de quo loquebatur, id est, h^l^canstum Domini,
quod tunc pro vnoquoque offertur quodammodo cum eius nomine baptizando
signatur, iterum si perm^nserit offerri non potest. Non ^elinquitur pro
peccatis sacrificium, hoc est, non pos^t d^nuo baptizari: nec tamen omnis qui
non accipit per doctrinam scientiam veritatis, debet arbitrari, posse pro se
illud osterri sacrificium, si iam oblatum (...) est, si iam eiu^dem veritatis
post baptismum Sacramenta percepit, non pot^st iterum baptizari August. T^m. 4
Expos. ad ^^m. page 1185. vsque ad page 1187.
every one, when he is baptized into the faith of Christ, does therein offer
up for his sins the sacrifice of Christ's passion. Neither is he alone in this
exposition, for he himself says, that those who entreat of this place more
diligently, do so understand it.

22 Secondly, they may be entreated to look upon their Jesuit Salmeron, who
does not utterly reject the same interpretation. And furthermore, (to the end
that Sensum hunc habere possunt, non esse hostiam illam cruentam Christi
crucifixi re^^quam pro baptizatis delin quentibus, neque si^^ilem rursus
baptismum omnino renouantem, vt dixit cap 6. cu^^s ibi mo^^n^t nomine re
crucifixionis, vt hic nomine hostiae iteratae: quia illa non nisi semel
applicatur, relinquitur tamen incruen^^ and alutaris hostia, quae applicatur
per poenitentiae Sacramentum. Salmeron Ies. in Heb. 10. disp. 19.
they may be abundantly satisfied) they must not think much to advise with
their learned Reader of Spain, who rendereth a reason Sed quaeris q^id causae
pletisque antiquorum suerit, vt Baptismum hostiam appellauerint, ideoque
dixerint non superesse hostiam pro peccatis, quia Baptismus repeti non potest
Sane quia baptismo commotimur, and per hoc Sacramentum applicatur nobis hostia
crucis ad plenam peccati remissionem: hinc illi per baptisma translatitie
hostiam nuncuparunt, and post baptisma semel acceptum nullam hostiam esse
reliquam interpretati sunt, quia baptismus secundus non est. Melchior Canu^
loc. Theolog. lib 12.. Quid igitur. fol. 424.
why the most of the ancient Fathers did call Baptism a sacrifice; which they
did, says he, metaphorically, that is, improperly.

23 Neither may we think that the terming of Baptism a sacrifice, is a
solecisme in divinity, seeing the same Apostle, speaking of rebaptizing, does
call it a recrucifying of Christ (as the forenamed Calling in this place that
an host or sacrifice, the repetition whereof (says he) is elsewhere called a
recrucifying of Christ, which is Baptism: whereof it is said, Heb. 6. that they
who are rebaptized do crucify again the Son of God. Where the same Jesuit:
Recrucifigere Christum and ludibrio habere, est Baptismum iterate, and
exitialem baptismi intinctionem efficere, vt est apud Clementem lib. 6. cap.
15. initiatos iterum baptizare tentantes crucifigunt Christum. Salmeron Ies.

Salmeron has out of (...)

Scripture the pole star, especially in so tempestuous a night of opposite
contentions; and as our Adversaries have done, for our more orderly passage,
make use of these two sails, dicta and facta, that is, the words and actions
of Christ in his first celebration of the Eucharist. And first,

30 When we exact a proof of a sacrifice out of the words of institution of
the Eucharist, we understand not words in their sillables, as (...) or (...),
that is, oblation or sacrifice; but in the express sense; notwithstanding some
of our Adversaries themselves Aliqui existim^nt Christum loquendo ad P^trem,

ad rationem sacrificij sieve ante sieve post consecra^ionem. Suarez Ies. tom. 3.

held it necessary (says their Jesuit) in this sacrifice, that Christ should
have performed it with these words of offering or sacrificing. But we are
contented to have a sacrifice proved, in such sort as we are able to prove
therein a Sacrament: which is not in the precise number of letters, but by the
prescribed matter, form, and end thereof: so expressly as their See in the
f^rmer Sect. ^n.
Jesuit means when he said, that Christ did expressly consecrate: and yet he
finds not the word consecration in Christ's speech, but words equivalent he
may find, as blessing, and giving of thanks, etc. which expressly betoken a
consecration. Now then to the point.

31 As it is some degree of reverence of Scriptures in our Adversaries, to
seem to prove this their sacrifice out of Christ's ordinance: so will it be no
small derogation unto their doctrine, if when as they make promise Probatur
sacrificium Missae ex verbis institutionis: est autem argumentum hui^smodi,
Christus eipsum Patri obtulit sub specie panis, and (...) ipsum iussit fieri ab
Aposto^^s, and little suc cessoribus vsque ad finem mundi. Et hoc est vere and
proptie sacrificium. Bellar. l. 1. de Missa, cap. 12. principio.
to prove the sacrifice of the Mass out of the words of the institution of
Christ, they shall be found not so much as to seem to perform it.

32 Their strongest, and in effect, their only fort is founded upon two words
of Christ Luc. 22. 19.
[do this:] from whence some Romanists are said (by M. Calvin and Kemnitius)
to reason thus; Christ said [hoc facite, do this] but facere est sacrificare,
that is, to do, is to sacrifice, according to the verse of the Poet Virgil,
saying, Cum faciam vitula, that is, when I shall do a calfe, etc. This
observation of our Authors out of some Romanists, their Cardinal Sed anteq^am
progrediamur ad hoc comprobandum, operaepretium erit imposturam Aduersariorum
refutare. Johannes Calumus fingit Catholicos ita proba^e propositionem nostri
argumenti Christus dixit [hoc fac^te^ sed facere est sacrificare, iuxta illud
Virgilij [Cum faciam vitula. ^rgo Dominus iussit sacrificare. Et Martinus
Kemnitius Catholicos ridet, quod hoc vtantur argumento. Sed errant, nec bona
fide referunt argumenta Catholicorum. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa cap 12. in
principio.
Bellarmine calls an imposture; for the Protestants err (says he) and do
falsely relate the arguments of the Catholickss. But seeing by Catholics he
understands Romanists, the relation of the Protestants will not be found
imposturous, but his answer calumnious, even by the witness of their own late
Cardinal Sunt qui sacrificium esse ostendere conantur ex verbo [sacite, quia
illud aliquando accipitur pro sacrificare, vt cum Virgilius dicit, Cum faciam
vitula pro frugibus, ipse venito. Iansenius Concord. cap. 131. page 904.
Iansenius; who reporting the arguments used by their own Authors to prove a
sacrifice out of the word [facite] says, that some of them do it, because the
word [facere] is sometime taken for to sacrifice, as when the Poet Virgil says
[Cum faciam vitula, etc.] And it may seem that these were not all men of
inferior note, seeing that Gregory de Ex Exodus 9. Hoc est quod facies in
Altari, etc. -- Et Poet^, Cum faciam vitula, etc. Gregor. de Valent. Ies. de
Sacrificio Missa, lib. 1. cap. 4. Fatentur. page 519.
Valentia, their greatly authorized Jesuit will have it known, that he is one
of the number of them, who have used the same argument, saying, as says the
Poet, Cum faciam vitula. How then could our Authors deserve so bitter a
taxation and charge of impostureship? But it suffices us that Cardinal
Bellarmine is ashamed of this poetical argument: and therefore we proceed to
examine, whether he can supply any reason which may be truly called
Apostolical.

33 To this purpose ^t quidem quod Christus obtulit sacrificium, iussitque
offer^i corpus suum sub specie panis and vini: certum est ex illis verbis Luc.
22. Hoc facite in recordationem mei. Illud enim, hoc demonstrat id quod Dominus
fecit in Coena, quod ante se obtuler at Patri. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap.
12. Sed his.
he (as Et Greg. de Valent. Ies. So Suarez. Ies. tom. 3. disp. 75.. 4.
others) insisteth upon the same words [hoc facite] saying, that Christ offered
a sacrifice, and commanded it to be offered certainly in these words, [hoc
facite, do this,] where the word [hoc, this] does demonstrate that which Christ
did in the Supper, viz. to sacrifice himself. Which is so empty and pithlesse
a proof, that their own Apud Hebraeos ve^bum Asa, quod est facere, nonnunquam
sacrificare significat, vt Exodus 10. etc. -- Vt autem vel hoc ex loco, vel ex
alijs Scripturae locis efficaciter probari non possit, hoc esse sacrificium:
tamen ex Ecclesiae traditione id e^si aciter p^obatu^. Iansinius C^ncord. cap.
131. page 904.
Iansenius, as it were despairing of the issue, does say, that notwithstanding
this sacrifice cannot be effectually proved by this text of hoc facite: yet may
it be proved by tradition. Which causes us to admire our Adversaries vain
pretenses, who profess to expound Scriptures according to the consent of
ancient Fathers, and yet now their greatest Doctor Bellar lib. 1. de M^ssa,
cap. 12. has not one testimonte out of any Father for proof of this
interpretation, ^acite, id est, Sacrificate.
Cardinal Bellarmine, when he contendeth for their great Diana, the Romish
sacrifice of the Mass, and would prove it out of the words [hoc facite,] does
not out of all the catalogue of ancient Fathers cite any one (that we find,)
who interprets, facite, to be sacrificate. Neither indeed can it be so
enforced: for, as their Cardinal Re^ertur pronomen [hoc] non tantu^ ad
sumptionem, ed ad alia omnia, quae mox Christus fecisse dicitu^nen pe, accipere
p^nem, grat^as agere, benedicere, ac verbis suis consecrate [Hoc est corpus
meum,] frangere, and su^^re. Iansenius Concord. cap. 131. (...).
Iansenius truly notes, the Pronoune [hoc, this] is to be referred not only
to the taking of the Eucharist, but unto all those particulars which Christ is
said forthwith to have done: as namely, the taking bread, giving of thanks,
blessing, and breaking, etc.

34 Their other reasons taken from these words, [It is given, broken, shed for
you,] which they interpret to signify to be a Habemus alia tri^ argumenta in

prevail, who says, that ^uangelistae in voce praesentis, effunditur; and
Paulus in, frangit^r, futuram in cruce effusionem, and carnis fractionem
significarunt. -- tempore praesenti grammatico more, tempus effusionis and

per hoc sicut in inchoato die potest significari in praesenti quicquid fit illo

both the Evangelists and S. Paul did use the present tence, in saying, the
blood is shed, and the body is broken, because very presently after he was to
begin the work of his passion: which, (says he) is a grammaticallsence, as
when a man uses to say, he is doing that which shortly after he intends to
accomplish: and Non est negandum morem esse Scripturae, vt ea dicantur fieri de

this is (as their Jesuit Salmeron observes) an usual phrase of speech in
the Scripture. Thus our Adversaries wanting all direct proofs of their
sacrifice, from the words of Christ in the institution of the Eucharist, are
become by their own Delivered in the former Section.

dying upon the Cross, was offered himself, and is sacrificed daily in this
Sacrament, because in this Sacrament there is a commemoration of that sacrifice
of the Cross, which was once offered. Could it have stood with the learning of
so great a moderator of their ancient School, and so subtle a searcher into
all the articles of the Romish faith, to have left undecided this point of
real sacrificing of Christ, the principal part of their now Priesthood and
worship, if he had then believed that any part of the Mass were to be esteemed
a proper and an essential sacrifice? Hitherto have we entreated of the first
question, showing that in the Mass there is no proper sacrifice: now come we
to the second question, and prove

That the sacrifice of the Mass cannot be accounted truly propitiatory: which
the consequents of our Adversaries do evidently enforce: First from their
prescribed manner of Sacrifice.
SECT. 12.
45 Although this be an undoubted consequence, to wit, that it cannot be called
properly a sacrifice propitiatory, which is proved not to be properly a
sacrifice, in so much that the conclusion of the former question might give a
supersedeas unto the second: yet the importunity of the Apologists may seem
to challenge of us a proof of this second conclusion: which we are ready to
perform by arguments taken from the manner, the cause efficient, the end, and
the effect of a sacrifice properly called propitiatory.

46 In the manner of this sacrifice there is to be required a destruction of
the thing sacrificed, and that this destruction be bloody, and that this blood
be by death, and that this death, and blood, and all be sensible and visible.
Of the first point their Cardinal Bellarmine says, Adverum sacrificium
requiritur vt quod offertur Deo in sacrificium, plane destruatur, id est ita
mutetur vt desinat esse id quod erat: and in hoc differt a sim plici oblatione,
quae interdum ritu mystico ele^abatur coram Deo, sed non destruebatur, nisi cum
vere sacrificabatur: -- vt non solum vsus tei Deo offeratur, sed ipsa etiam
substantia, and ideo non solum vsus, sed substantia consumatur. Bellarm. lib.
1. de Missa, cap. 2.. Octauo. Verum and reale sacrificium veram and realem
mortem aut destructionem rei immolatae desiderat. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. vlt.. Haec
sententia: and. Quod autem.
In every true sacrifice which is offered unto God, the thing that is
sacrificed must suffer destruction, even in the very substance thereof, so
that it cease to be that which it was before. Which assertion is true,
especially in all propitiatory sacrifices, this kind indeed did always suffer
a destruction, and that by * shedding of blood, and was therein a figure of
that perfect sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross, wherein his body did sustain
a destruction, for man's propitiation. But can this real destruction be
affirmed of Christ his body in the Mass without impiety? Their Cardinal
Bellarmine says, Consumptio seu manducatio, quae fit a Sacerdote, quod sit
pars essentia^^s Sacrificij, inde probatur, quia in tota action Missae nulla
est alia realis destruction victimae praeter istam: requiri autem realem
destructionem supra probatum est. Idem ibid. prop. 7.
A real destruction is indeed an essential point of a sacrifice: and in the
Mass the Priests eating is the consumption of this sacrifice; yet are not our
Adversaries so utterly forlorn of divine light, as to understand such a real
destruction of our Lords body by the Priests eating, that it ceasseth to be in
substance that which it was before: no, Card. Bellar. See above, l. 2. c. 2. 24
and so following. As for the (...) which he would make, saying, Christus non
amittit suum natural, cum manducatur, sed amittit esse Sacramentale. Bellar.
lib. 1. de Missa, cap. vlt.. Tertio, is only his own figment, and
contradicts the examples of the old law (which all were naturally consumed,
and the Archetypon of all sacrifices, Christ, whose natural body was wounded
unto death) and his own grant, saying, The substance of the sacrifice must
suffer destruction.
they rather choose to say, that not Christ, but the forms of bread and wine
are the things which are torn and consumed with the teeth, and that the body
of Christ does not sustain any diminution.

47 The conclusion of these premises is thus comprehended: Every thing really
and substantially sacrificed, does suffer a destruction of substance: but the
body of Christ does not suffer a real, but only a Sacramental destruction;
^^ go the body of Christ is figuratively, and not substantially sacrificed in
the Mass; and so consequently cannot be truly propitiatory.

48 That a propitiatory sacrifice ought to be also bloody, may be proved by a
like deducement from our learned Adversary, who defines Propitiatorisi est,
cuius finis, praeter Dei cultum, itati Dei propitiatio est, and peccatorum
remissio. Bellar. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 1.
a (...) propitiatory to be that which does pacify the wrath of God, for the
remission (...). And we know what is written: Et sine sanguinis effusione non
fit remissio. Heb. 9 22.
Without shedding of blood there is no remis^ion: which is spoken of the
sacrifices of the old law, but yet (as their Aqu^^as teaches) was a Per quod
figurabatur quod remissio peccati erat fienda per tanguinem Christi. Aquinas
^om. in cum loc^^. Bellar. Greg de Valen. and others in their disputes.
prefiguration of the shedding of the blood of Christ. But how shed? even as
the word Obijcit Kemnitius: Sin in Missae action sanguis estunderetur, no
esset Missae sacrifici^ incruentum. Resp. Non effunditur sanguis in specie
propria, sed in specie vini: dicitu^ enim sanguis tunc fundi in coena, cum in
specie liquida in calice collectus offertur Deo, ac deinde in eadem specie
funditur in or a sumentium. Sed haec effusio non facit sacrificium eruentum,
cum sanguis reipsa ^ corpore non egrediatur. Bellar (...) Missa, cap. 12.. Ad
hoc. and. Ad secundum.
(...) signifies, to wit, a pouring it out of his body. Now in their Mass
the blood (says Cardinal Bellarmine) goes not out of Christ's body; in which
respect they call it Sacrificium in cruce cruentum crat. Hoc est incruentum.
Greg. (...) Ies. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 5. tag. 623 col. 1. And out of the
Councels and Fathers, Suarez tom. 3. disp. 74.. 2.
an unbloody sacrifice. Ergo, say we, it is no sacrifice propitiatory, that
is, effectual in it self for the pacifying of the wrath of God for sin. The
answer which our Adversaries make, (saying, Dicimus (...) sacramentaliter in
Eucharistia immolari, non quia mors repraesentatur illius, sed quia ex vi
verborum consecratio^^ ^^^aratim s^lum corpus and solus sanguis consicitur: quo
ipso vere a sanguine corpus separaretur, atque adeo funderetur (...) e corpore,

lib. 2. cap. 4. page 507. col. 1.
that albeit in the Eucharist the blood of Christ is inscparably in his body:
yet is it truly severed sacramentally by the word of consecration,) is unto our
understanding a kind of riddle, telling us of a thing separated, which they
say, is indiuisibly joined together: and contrary unto the sacrifices of
prefigutation in the law, wherein blood was powered out; contiarie to the truth
in Christ, out of whose side there Ioh. 19. 34.
issued blood and water; and contrary unto the Sacrament of the Eucharist,
instituted for the remembrance and representation of death by the real Heb. 9
22.
effusion of blood, as is furthermore figured in his first 1. Cor. 11. ^^, 24,
25.
taking bread, and afterward the Cup. All which preach unto us a real
separation of Christ's blood from his body, and teach us, that in their Mass
there may not be acknowledged the proper effect of a propitiatory sacrifice of
remission of sins without a proper cause thereof, even a real effusion of
blood, which causes death: which is the third point belonging unto the manner
of this sacrifice.

49 All Christians know that the Eucharist was ordained by Christ, as a seal
of the new Hoc poculum est nouum Testamentum, qui pro multis effundetur in
remissionem peccatorsi. Math. 26. 28.
Testament in his blood, for the remission of sin. And this new Testament (as
their learned Heb 9. 15. ^^t ideo noui Testamenti mediator est, vt morte
intercedente in redemptionem earum praeuaricauonum, quae erant sub priore
Testamento, repromissionem accipiant qui vocati sunt, aeternae haereditatis.]
Vbi enim Testamentum, ^ccesle est vtmors Testatoris intercedat. -- Ostendit nos

death of the Testator Christ. Will our Adversaries answer, that in their Mass
Christ does truly die? Idem omnes Catholics sentiunt and confitenru^* quis enim
voquam dixit aut alium Redemptorem esse quaerendum, aut hunc nostrum mori
opor^ere? quis nescit quod scriptum est Romans 6, Christus resurgens a mortuis,

Never any Catholic affirmed this, says their Jesuit Ribera: and Cassander
accounts (...)

(...)meth (says he) that Christ would it should be so: but we may not
curtously enquire why. Yet must he give us leave again and again to enquire
how that sacrifice, which has in it self a virtue only finite, shall pacify
Gods wrath, which as God himself, is in it self infinite.

53 But we leave our Adversaries in conflict with themselves, some attributing
unto the sacrifice of their Mass only a finite virtue, and some an Missa est

poenis omnium peccatorum. Ca^et. q. 79. Art. 5. and Tom. 2. Opuscul. tract. 3.

infinite. Now that they have erred in the causes of a truly propitiatory
sacrifice, how should we expect a satisfaction concerning the effects? For here
arises

A third consequence, taken from the effects of a Sacrifice propitiatory: our
Adversaries themselves being at a demurre, and questioning what is
propitiatory.

release of those punishments, the guilt whereof had been formerly pardoned;
which is their last and most general defense. And yet when they enquire,
whether the virtue of one Mass be as effectual for many men, as when it is
offered but for one, they will determine the point, and yet confess, that

they are distracted into contrary Qui sola^ vim impetra^di in Altaris hostia

opinions.

55 Well then, what does their sacrifice propitiate for? mortal sins? No,
said the universal consent of their Schools. Does it procure pardon for
sins venial? Nor so, said other of their learned Doctors. That which
remains is, to be auailable only for release of some temporal punishment
due unto sins, the gilt and offense whereof has been pardoned: which
position first fights with it self, both because (as their Canus affirms,)
Non est plene remissa culpa, quamdiu peccator est reus soluendae poenae. Canus
loc. Theol. lib. 12.. Ex quo. fol. 435.
the sin is not fully pardoned, so long as the offender is subject unto
punishment, and also because propitiation, as has been confessed, is a
pacifying of Gods wrath, which does look only upon mortal sins, and no
mortal sins have propitiation in their Mass: we are therefore enforced by
their own positions to make this conclusion; There is no proper propitiatory
sacrifice in the Mass. Now behold

A mirror of superstition offering it self unto us to be pointed at,
concerning the Priests fee or portion in the Romish Sacrifice.
SECT. 15.
56 Lest that our Reader might peradventure marvel why our Adversaries can be
so ^rgent for their sacrifice, which we see to be a matter depending upon so
many uncertainties, incongruities, and impossibilities, he may be partly
satisfied if he but mark their Jesuits doctrine, teaching that there is in
this sacrifice of the Mass a certain Quaedam portio remissionis peccatorum

whomsoever he by his Memento shall think good: which is not so auailable for
many, as if it be applied to one alone: therefore it is, that he that procures
the Priest to have him in his intention, would be offended if the Priest should
extend it unto many. This reason may seem to savor too much of Demetrius his
devotion, crying, Act. 19 28

The Antithesis or opposite doctrine of Protestants.
SECT. 18.
69 As for the Protestants, they in their divine and public Service do
profess Christ the son of God, to be the only true Priest of the new
Testament; who being God and man, was only able to work in himself
propitiation with God for man; and his sacrifice once offered upon the Cross,
to be the all and only sufficient sacrifice for the remission of sins: which
by an Eucharisticall and thankful commemoration (according unto the
acknowledged tenor of ancient Apud veteres loquendi cons^etudo vsitatissima
est, -- pro Martyribus, pro quorum cer taminibus, Deo gratiae agebanbantur, and
quor^m precibus Ecclesia commendabatur, of^erre diceretur; cum viz. in mystica

Liturgies for all the faithful, whether Martyri, Patriarchs, Prophets, or
Apostles, and all Saints) they present unto God, as an effectual propitiation
both for the quick and the dead; by the which prayers they apply the same
propitiatory sacrifice unto the good of all that are capable. But what? not the
body as it is glorified, but as then freshly bleeding upon the Cross; which
does, not by a casual or deceivable intention of the Priest, but according
unto the faith of the believer, nor by a finite virtue of that sacrifice, but
by an infinite, work a full remission, not only of venial, but also of
mortal sins, according unto the tenor of holy writ, [ 1. Ioh. 2. If any man
sin, we have an Advocate, Jesus Christ the righteous, and ^e is the
propitiation for etc.

from all] excepting no sin: and by the same virtue does redeem us not so
much from temporal punishment, as from eternal: building this their doctrine
not upon uncertain conjectures, but as it becomes the heirs of truth, upon
the written will of our Testator Jesus: and finally defend the same not with
the inconstancy of innumerable contradictions, but with the strength of an
universal consent. All which do perfect this our Appeal, and we conclude in
the sentence of S. Sacrificium cum exhibetu^ Deo secundum vetam eius
inspirationem and doctrinam, vera religio est: quod si non habeat, erit no^ia
superstitio. August. epist. 49.
Augustine, A sacrifice (says he, using the word in a large sense) when it is
offered unto God according to his inspiration and doctrine, it is true
religion; but if it want that direction, it is a pestilent and contagious
superstition.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.

appears in Cyprian and Tertullian: that also M. Fulke in his confutation of

post med.
Tertullian, Cyprian, Austen, Hierome, and a great many more, do ^itnesse, that
sacrifice for the dead is the tradition of the Apostles. That likewise prayer
for the dead is taught in the writings M. D. Fulke in his confutation of

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First in answer unto the objected exceptions.
SECT. 1.
FRom Sacrifice, which they account to be a prayer real, consisting in an
outward oblation, they have proceeded unto a verbal prayer exhibited in words.
And first, in their allegation of the testimony of Doctor How come we (says
he) to the knowledge of this secret^ by tradition of the Apostles? or who is

Hierome, and a great number. Fulke de Purgat. in the place objected. Where
although in his Reply he take a shorter course then to answer these
particulars, yet he no where grants that they are truly objected, as indeed
they are not.
Fulke, they have turned the words of his objection into an answer: and are
contented to hear him acknowledge a general use of prayer for the dead in
some former times; but wittingly neglect to distinguish of the diverse manners,
intentions, affections, opinions, and grounds of that his saying, from whence
they might have See hereafter Cap. 26.

2 After, they produce Dionysius Areopagita, whom for this For hereafter he
will appear to be another man, Cap. 26.
present we will suppose to be as true and ancient a Dionysius, as they
themselves would make him seem to be: in whose writings there is mention of
prayer for the dead; but yet such, as whereby the fundamental cause of Romish
prayer for the dead, is rather confuted: as will appear See more fully in the
Sections following.
partly in this next Section, where we are to show,

What the doctrine of Antiquity was, and wherein it differed from the now
Romish Article of prayer for the dead.
SECT. 2.
3 As use of praying for the dead, was frequent in the ancient Fathers, amongst
whom we find Credo generosam omnem, Deoque cha^am animam, posteaquam corporis
vinculis soluta hinc excesserit, protinus hilare ad Dominum su^i conuolare,
beatitudinemque. imaginatione percipere. Paulo post: Nunc, ^ vitae and mortis

And a little after:* Ipse ad Christi peruenit requiem, manet in lumine, and
sanctorum coetibus gloriatur 1 the prays in the same place: Da requiem,
Domine, perfectam seruo tuo Theodosio, requiem illam quam praeparasti sanctis

Ambrose praying for two Emperors, Theodosius and Valentinian, and offering
oblations for their souls: notwithstanding that the same Fathers had
pronounced those Emperors already to have been possessours of the pleasures
of life, in the heavenly Jerusalem. And S. Nunc pro peccatis meae matris

Augustine, even then when he believed that his mother was freed from all
punishments, yet sent he forth a dimitte for her soul.

souls? e Nihil pro ijs orat Sacerdos, sed eos orat. Durantus lib 2. de Riti^.
cap. 35.


5 Now what the doctrine of the Romanists is, equity wills us to learn from
themselves, who teach, that Quaestio est quibus prosint suffragia desunctis;
certum est ea non prodesse ^eatis, nec damnatis, quia priores non egent,
posteriores non possunt inuari. Bellar. lib. 2. Purgat. cap. 18. After he
numbreth ^^ the certainty of blessed Martyri. Iniuriam facit Martyri, qui orat
pro Martyr, inquit August. intelligens eum, qui remissionem pec^a^^rum, vel
essentialem gloriam precatur. A little after he reckons among the damned,
whom our prayers ^arn: profit, Pueros qui sunt in Limbo. Whom then do they
profit? Solum ijs prosunt, qui sunt in Purgatorio. Ibid. Nimirum in atrocissima
poena. Etiam minima poena Purgatorij mayor quam maxima huius vitae, qua omnis
anima cruciatur, quae est in Purgatorio. Bellar. ibid cap. 14.
prayers do not profit souls that do already enjoy blessedness, among whom
Martyrs are to be reckoned: nor yet the damned, whether they be in the lowest
hell, as reprobates, or in Limbo, as unbaptized infants, both which are forlorn
of all hope of help: but they avail only (say they) for souls tormented in
the flames of Purgatory, wherein the least pain is greater then the greatest
that can be devised in this world. But seeing this their profession of hellish
imprisonments, cannot (as we have At has been proved: see before
proved) be confirmed from antiquity, this one observation may justly reprove
their irregular defense, wherein we find them appealing unto an authority of
Fathers, half of whose doctrine they themselves do wholly renounce; whereof we
may give them instance in their objected Dionysius, so highly by them advanced
for antiquity, and for the truth of the point in question so vrgently enforced.

Concerning Dionysius.
SECT. 3.
6 Their Author Dionysius distinguishes three sorts of souls departed,
whereof some died unbaptized, others as known and notorious sinners, the third
sort were holy believers. Of this last kind (for of this kind is our whole
dispute) he witnesses of his time, that after their death they De his quae
siunt in ijs, qui obdormierunt. Dionys. Areopag. Hierarch, ca. 11. Mortuis, qui
no^ sunt initiati, and sunt peccatores, haec non precatur and optat. Dionys.

12.
were brought unto the Bishop of the Church with Psalms of thankfulness, the
assembly rejoicing in confidence that they were presently made possessors of
eternal life, and received crowns and garlands of blessedness, the fruits of
their profession. Which solemnities ended, all men there present do kiss the
corpse, as of a man amiable, and honorable; and so his body is committed to
the earth, never making any mention of any flames of Purgatory, or place of
misery, or long delay of their glory (the definite points of Romish prayers;)
but as though he had by preoccupation confuted such conceits, he teaches, that
Quod autem nos a diuinis praeceptoribus nostris de precatione, qua Antistes in
eo qui mortuus est, vtitur, traditum accepi^us, necessario exponendum est:
Diuinus Antistes interpres diuinoru^ iudicioru^, Angelus enim Domini est:
didicit ergo ^ Scripturis c^aris^ima vitam pro dignitate ac meritis cuiusque
tribui, diuina benignitate negligentiae maculas dilucte, quas in ijs contraxit
humana fragilitas, quandoquidem nemo mundus a sorde. Haec sciens Antistes
promissa esse, petit vt ea eueniant, and dentur ijs, qu^ sancte vixerunt.
Dionys. ibid.
God in such men does pardon their uncleanness and sins, which were
committed through humane frailty, and rewards their good works with glory.
Now take away venial sins, the greatest part of the fuel of Romish
Purgatory, and only cause of their prayers for the dead, and then half that
fire would soon slake, and their prayers cease.

7 Agreeable hereunto was the judgment of Christians, long after, in the days
of S. Chrysostom, who condemns Cum video luctus in plateis and lamentationes
super eos qui ex hac vita migrarunt, and vl^lationes, and ineptias alias,
(credit mihi) erubesco, quia Ethnici nos irrident: non enim quae a me dicuntur

giving us a liberty to dissent from him in some cases, he does also thus
direct us, Vbi de ^e obscurissima disputatur, non adiuuantibus diuinarum
Scripturarum certis clarisque testimonijs, cohibere se debet humana
praesumptio. August lib. 2. de pecc. merit. and remiss. cap. 36.
viz. In any doubtful matter it is presumption to believe, when there is no
evident place of Scripture to resolve upon. Of which kind are both the Romish
doctrine of Purgatory, and prayer for the dead: whereof we have neither
precept, nor promise, nor direct example in the volume of Gods book, no not
where purposely, and at large there is a discoursing of the state of the dead.

13 Nor can our Adversaries be ignorant of that which their own Matthias
Brederbachius in libello de dissidijs componendis. (De oblations and sacrificio
ad Altar) pro salute viuorum and mortuorum, hoc ^^quam exprimunt scripta
Fuangelistarum and Apostolorum, etc. as he is ci^ed by our Osiander, lib. Papa
non Papa, cap. 17.
Bred^nbachius has acknowledged, that there is not found any where, in all the
writings of the Apostles and Evangelists, any oblation and sacrifice for the
salvation of the quick and the dead.

14 Wherefore seeing this Romish doctrine is found to have proceeded not from
faith, but from doubtfulnesse; nor from a direct and Catholic consent, but
from prejudice, much less from the light of the divine Testament, which is the
direct line and level of all necessary truth: we are justly stayed from
performing any such kindness, which in stead of showing love unto the dead,
might seduce the living with deceiucable hopes of succor after their death;
where it assures the Church, that all such as die in Christ Apo^. 14. 13.
are in blessed rest from their labors: but the wicked and such as die in
their sins, sink down unto the lowest hell, as hopeless when dead, to be
relieved by the prayers of the living, as were Father Abraham, send unto my

oil of other men's devotions to light their lamps. Wherefore we do not doubt,
but sober and judicious Readers will conceive of Protestants, as of men who are
not addicted to fancies or presumptions of men, but wholly consecrated (as long
as they live) unto the direction of divine illumination and perfect light of
faith, the word of God: whereby whosoever will not be guided in this life, must
notwithstanding be judged as soon as he is dead.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THis is no controversy concerning the Article of Christ his descension into
hell, but only one pretended effect thereof, viz. the harrowing of that brimme
of hell, which they call Limbus Patrum, or place wherein they think ancient
Patriaiks, and Prophets, and other faithful were detained before Christ's death.
Which their imagined Limbus is not now in esse, but, by their own doctrine,
has long since been broken up and Quartus est Limbus Patru^, qui est in
suprema part Inferni, in quo inest tantum poen a damni temporalis; nunc autem
est vacuus. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Purg. cap. 6.
dissolved. Nevertheless seeing this question is brought in among their
chiefest controversies: it will not a little concern us to trauerse this point
methodically, questioning first

Whether the Apologists have dealt sincerely with their witnesses.
SECT. 2.
2 We may not suffer our Reader to be misguided with the names of Thaddaeus,
and Ignatius S. John's scholar, as though this doctrine were so Apostolically
ancient: for Ignatius speaks not of souls delivered from their supposed
hell, but Vere, non hominum opinione crucifi^us est and mortuus videtibus
coelestibus, vt Angelis, terrestribus, vt Iudaeis and Romany, and Infernis, vt
multitudine eorum qui cum Domino resurrexerunt: multa enim (inquit Scriptura)
Sanctorum corpora ^ormientium resurrexerunt, monumentis patefactis; and
descendit ad inferos solus, ascendit vero cum multitudine, and scidit maceriam,
quae a seculo erat, and medium parietem eius dissoluit, and resurrexit intra
tres dies. Ignatiu^ epist. ad Trallens.
of bodies of the dead, which at the resurrection of Christ were raised unto
life, or shall be raised at the last and general resurrection of the just. And
the Apocryphal speech of Thaddaeus to Abgarus, together with a pretended
Epistle of Christ also, which Eusebius found in Syria so many ages after the
death of Thaddaeus, as it needs better assurance, being Gelasius did. 15.
Vtramque epistolam vt Apocrypham reijcit. Senens. Biblioth. lib. 2. page 74.
condemned by Pope Gelasius; so can it not enforce more then has been granted
in the objection from Ignatius.

3 Neither can the Apologists escape our further reproof, for wresting out of
joint the testimony of our learned Bishop: For these words, all the Fathers
with one consent affirm, etc. are the words of his objection, and are c But
all the Fathers with one consent. And a little after: We see a number of
ancient Fathers inclining to this conclusion.
for that cause impaled within these kind of lists [] which are notes of
distinction: yet are alleged by them in stead of his judgment, which he
afterward delivers in these words, That indeed a number of ancient writers,
etc. therefore not all, but a number are granted. Whereupon arises our next
question;

Whether by the judgment of our Adversaries it be not lawful to take
exception against a number of ancients, in a matter of this nature: by the
testimony of our learned Adversaries.

souls before the day of judgment: both which the Church of Rome, together
with Protestants, does religiously disclaim, as being built upon false
foundations. And yet these same doctrines were long since defended with almost
as large consent, as was their Limbus. Therefore ought not the exceptions used
by Protestants, to be condemned, before that their arguments may be confuted;
which are three, viz. opposition of Fathers, Scriptures, and Reasons. Of all
which in order: and first

Whether the Romish Limbus be not repugnant unto the doctrine of ancient
Fathers.
SECT. 4.
5 That the souls of Abraham, and of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and other holy
servants of God before Christ's death, remained not so much as in some outward
court of heaven, or place of joy, but (which is the now Romish doctrine) in a
part of hell, even in a lake wherein is no water, that is, no comfort, until
Christ by his descending thither, did bring a general Iubilee, a Salmeron Ies.
tom. 10. tract. 50.
and plenary Indulgence, for their deliverance out of Satan's possession: this,
they say, is the general confessed doctrine. And to this end have they
collected the names of 21 Fathers, for proof of this their hellish
imprisonment.

6 But first, we think that doctrine cannot be called Apostolical, or
vvniuersal, whereof 400 years after Christ it was lawful for S. Augustinus
sentire videtur locum, in quo erant sancti ill^ Patriarchae, ante Christ's
aduentum, non fuisse in Inferno. Therefore he adds a little after. Quod
dubitando poti^s quam affirmando dixit. Suarez Ies. in Thom. par. 3. q. 52.
Art. 1. disp. 24.. 1. and disp. 42.. 1.
Augustine to doubt; who would not affirm (as our learned Adversaries
acknowledge) that the souls of the Patriarchs could be in hell.

7 Secondly, we affirm that it was never universally held of Fathers, that the
souls of Patriarchs, before the coming of Christ were contained in the list or
verge of the Romish hell: Origin. (...).

Tertullian judged to have been, if not in heaven, yet far higher then hell.
S. Augustine leaves the place Quod dixero, fratres, hoc si non vobis tanquam
certus exposuero, ne succenseatis; homo enim sum, and quantum conceditur de
Scripturtis sanctis, tantum audeo dicere, nihil ex me; infernum nec ego

not doubted to incline to this opinion, which is, to think that Valde suspicor

by Abraham's bosom is meant the highest heaven. Whence we conclude with our
foresaid learned Bishop, that Bishop Bilson in the 189. page of his book above
cited.
the opinion which holds that the souls of the dead before Christ's death
were in hell, has but a very weak foundation, and is contradicted both by
Scriptures and Fathers; and cannot be judged to have been amongst them, as it
is now amongst the Romanists, a doctrine of faith. For the better justification
of our defense, we proceed unto our second argument, the direction of
Scriptures, and try

Whether the Romish Limbus have any foundation in Scripture: by the judgment
of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
8 Let our Adversaries limite the borders of hell according unto their own
fancies; sure we are that the place which the Scripture calls hell, is noted
to be distinct from Abraham's bosom by a Luc. 16. 26.
(...): and another helthen that, the Scripture does not acknowledge. Their
Trent Catechism, Cardinal Bellarmine, Ribera, and Feuardentius propound the
place of The first place, Zach. 9. [Tu eduxisti vinctos e lacu, in quo non erat

Adversaries and we do jointly consent: and therefore we from the equal
consequence of Christ's omnipotent grace require their accordance in the former.

16 Neither can they justly except against it; for as in another question they
hold it reasonable to incline unto that opinion Illud videtur Christo magis

which more illustrateth the glory of Christ, and multiplieth the power of his
grace: so do they confess, that it is a greater argument of the power and
grace of Christ, immediately after death to exalt his faithful unto heaven,
then to suffer them to be sequestered in places of obscurity, and to linger in
an expectation of the desired fruition of Gods presence; which grace they have
therefore appropriated unto the dignity of the new Testament. This therefore
must be

Our Conclusion.
SECT. 8.
17 First, from the due examination of the testimonies of antiquity, we
conclude that the Romish doctrine of Limbus was not Catholic, because it was
repugnant unto the judgment of many ancient. 4.
Fathers. 2. From the search of divine authority, we conclude that it is no
doctrine of faith,. 5.
because it stands not upon holy Scripture the foundation of faith. 3. From
the trial by reasons we conclude, that the Protestants profess so much more
gracious and glorious a deliverance of the souls of Patriarchs by the power of
Christ's death, then do the Romanists, by how much more excellent a blessing it
is to be freed from ever coming into a prison, then after some long endurance
to be delivered from thence. And lastly, from the practice of our Adversaries
we conclude, that they are no competent challengers of antiquity in this case
of Limbus Patrum, who are guilty of such novelty in faining and teaching a. 6.
Limbus puerorum. We leave this point as less material, and enter upon their
next Article.

know that ever since the Apostles time, in a manner, it flourished every where,
until Martin Luther took the sword in hand against it. And that accordingly
the most ancient Fathers, namely. Hereof see Abraham cultetus in medulla

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing that diverse Romanists, yea and some Jesuits
will acknowledge a defect of judgment in some ancients, concerning the
doctrine of Free Will.
SECT. 1.
IT seems unto us a thing unreasonable in these obiectors, to charge us to
satisfy for the sayings of A man schismatically divided from our Church, and a
contemner of the verdict of antiquity.
Penrie, the author of their first testimony: yet our answers shall be such as
become them who are the professed debtors unto truth, and not respecters of
men's persons. Now therefore to the point.

2 The censure which the judicious Protestants have passed upon ancient
Authors, is not an universal taxation of all, but yet of many. Now if the
Apologists had not in this their opposition rather affected (as may be feared)
seducement then judgment, they might have taught their Reader Chrysostom'

from their own Sixtus Senensis, and from three of their principal Jesuits,
that in the root of the doctrine of free will, Chrysostom, Cyrill,
Theophylact, Euthymius, Oecumenius, Ammonius, and most of others, especially in
the Greek Church, did yield too much unto the power of nature in the free will
of man. And in this, and other doctrines of affinity therewith, did seem to
have inclined contrary unto Scripture, unto the error of the Pelagians.
Wherein we easily perceive with what prejudice the Apologists have been
transported thus to traduce Protestants as being injurious in that taxation,
wherein, by the judgment of their own Jesuits, they stand justifiable unto
every conscience of man. Nevertheless we do not so judge the Fathers as
herein damnably erroneous, but so far excuse them, as we shall be able to show

That the censured Fathers were but inconsta^tly erroneous in their doctrine of
Free Will: who did often deliver unto us, concerning it, most wholesome
receipts.

Protestants (say our Adversaries) do acknowledge in man's will a freedom from
coaction and force, but not a freedom from necessity, which freedom
consists in this, that it may will or not will, as it list. Whereas Libertatem
a necessitate probamus per Concilium Tridentinum Sess. 6. cap. 5. dicit hominem
libere consentire diuinae inspirationi, quippe quam reijcere etiam potest. Et
Can. 4. dicit liberum arbitrium sicut consentire, ita dissentire posse -- Tunc

eligere, assentire, and dissentire, and summatim suum vltimum actum edere, and

the Council of Trent has defined, that the will of man is free in it self
to receive or reject any divine inspiration, placing the freedom of will in
the indifference of election, as able (in it self) to choose or refuse any
divine motion: But, Intelligimus hos haereticos (meaning Protestants) non
negare quin voluntas nostra physic^ operetur, quando vult; sed quia physica
quadam efficacitate determinatur a Deo, vt velit. per efficacissimam
voluntatem, qua eam praeuenit; ideo aiunt nostram voluntatem passive se habere
in ea motione, vel quia non libere agit, vel certe quia (vt morales Philosophi
loquuntur) non se agit, sed agitur a Deo: quamuis dum agitur, ipsa etiam
efficiat actum physica efficientia. Suarez Ies. lib. 1. de Concursu. cap. 12.
Protestants, (say they) albeit they confess the will to work, when it
wills, yet does it not of it self receive Gods inspiration unto good, but
that it is acted, and determinately wrought by the most powerful operation and
inspiration of God, to consent unto good.

9 And our Adversaries would have their Readers further to understand, that the
question concerns not the will of a man, as he stands in the state of grace,
but as he is now to be converted from sin unto repentance: for of them that
are in the state of justification, the Cooperamur Deo non solum, vt Aduersarij
volunt, post iustificationem; sed etiam in ipsa iustificatione and initio
fidei. -- Non, nisi cooperantibus nobis, Deus gratiam nostram operatur. Bellar.
lib. 6. de Great. and lib. arbit. cap. 11.
Protestants (says their Cardinal) do grant that man's will does cooperate
with grace. Therefore the sum and brief of this controversy (that I may
join Doctor Stapletons testimony unto the rest) Quaestio est, quomodo diuina
gratia mentem and voluntatem hominis ad hos motus excitet, vtrum sua sola
operatione, an euam cooperatione voluntatis, -- ita vt ^^cunque excitante
grati^, libere tamen voluntas eam acceptare, vel repudiate possit Stap^et. lib.
4. de (...). 1.
is, whether the grace, which first moves and exciteth the will unto good
motions, does work the consent alone; or whether the will have in it self a
power freely to consent, and resist every such motion. The Romanists plead for
the power of man's will, but Protestants for the efficacy of Gods grace. Now
according to our promise, we are to establish our doctrine by the suffragies
and voices of learned Romanists, and produce

The five confessed consequences of our Adversaries, concluding against the
Romish doctrine of Free Will: the first is taken from the natural faculty of
will.
SECT. 5.
10 Quaestio tractari solet, sit ne officium lib. arbit. agere vel pati, five,
quod idem est, sit ne voluntas humana potentia passiua, an actiua. Sunt de hac
re Theologorum variae sententiae. Sententia ve^issima est, esse eam simpliciter
actiuam. Bellarm. lib. 3. de lib. arbit. cap. 10.
It is questioned (says their Cardinal) whether will be a faculty active or
passive: and he resolves, that it is simply active: Si liberum arbitrium esset
potentia passiua, fal^o diceretur liberum: non enim est in potestate patientis
quid in ipso fiat, sed in potestate agentis est quid in alio faciat. Ibid..
Praeterea.
because (says he) if it were passive, it could not be free. Showing that for
defending of that freedom of will (which by their Council of Trent is found
to consist in an indifferency of consenting or not consenting to any
spiritual good,) it is necessary that the nature of will be acknowledged to
be simply active, and not passive: otherwise it cannot be judged to be simply
free. But many ancient professors in their Romish Schools, as namely Tres sunt
de hac re Theologorum sententiae; prima est eorum, qui humanam voluntatem
pastiuam potentiam esse volunt, ac docent actum voluntatis produci active a
phantasmate, vel ab obiecto cognito, vel certe ab ipsa mente apprehendence and
iudicante obiectum. Haec est sententia Gotrifridi, and Aegidij. Altera est
eoru^ qui volunt partim esse actiuu^, partim pass^^u^: ita vt ad actionem
voluntatis eliciendam causae duae concurrant partiales, tum ipsa voluntas, t^m
etiam obiectum cognitum, seu ratio proponens obiectum: ita docent Gregorius,
and Gabriel, and Petrus Paluda^is a^cedit Caietanus, qui scribit voluntatem
moueri active a se ipsa quoad exercitium, ab intellectu autem quoad
specificationem. Bellar. ibid.. Prima. and. Altera. We may add Aquinas, to
whom Bellarmine would answer. Thomas 1. part. q. 82. art. 4. and de verit. q.
22. art. 12. Intelligimus a Thoma vocatam esse voluntatem potentiam passiuam
largo modo, nam ipsum moueri ab obiecto per modum finis, quoddam pati est, si
agere and pati sumantur proomni genere causae. Ibid. c. 11.. Quar^^^
argumentum, etc.
Gottifridus, Aegidius, Gregorius, Gabriel, Paludanus, Caietan, did all (as
Cardinal Bellarmine witnesses) hold that will is a faculty, either partly or
wholly passive. And therefore all these their own Doctors do necessarily, by a
confessed consequence, overthrow the Romish doctrine of man's will in his first
conversion unto grace.

11 A second confessed consequence, whereby the Romish freedom of will is
subverted, is taken from the efficacy of Gods spirit, in determinating or
necessitating man's will. For Si Deus esset agens necessarium, and determinaret
voluntatem humanam, illa non libere, sed necessario ageret, vt Aduersarij
admittunt. -- Nam si nos admittamus, ita determinari voluntatem humanam a Deo,
vt non possit agere, nisi id, ad quod a Deo determinatur, and tamen quia Deus
eam libere determinat. and ipsa voluntary and cum pleno iudicio rationis agit:
contendamus hominem esse liberi arbitrij. tota controuersia inter nos and
haereticos erit de nomine. At profecto labores tot hominum doctissimorum, and
ipsius Conc. Oecumenici, pro asserenda arbitrij liberate conscripti, (...)
nobis persuadent. Bellar. lib. 4. de lib. arb. cap. 14. Deinde. and. Quodsi.
if (says Cardinal Bellarmine) God does determine man's will, that is, so
moves it that it cannot but follow the inspiration, then have we no reason
(says he) to contend any longer with Protestants concerning the liberty of the
will of man. Why? Quo supra.
Because such a determination or application of the will by Gods motion, does
take away the liberty of will: so he. And accordingly their Jesuit Suarez, Non
video quomodo cum hac physica determinatione voluntatis libertatis vsus atque
exercitiu^ possit consistere. Suarez Ies. opus^. tract. br^^is resol^^ tag. 463.
I cannot see (says he) but it must do so: Ij (Protestants) voluntatem
efficacitate diuina necessitari affirmances, arbitrij libertatem tollunt: --
non autem in sensu composito (hominem enim qua vult non posse, non velle certum
est) qu^e qui praedeterminatione^ suam in sensu diuiso obtrudunt, cum Caluino
aperte sentiunt, and Concilij Tridentini Decreto refelluntur. Benius lib. de
^ffic. great. (...). 12. page 231. Et isti impensius adhuc libertatem euertunt
quam Caluinus Ibid. page 232.
For, says Benius their Divine of Padua, whosoever attributes such an
efficacy unto the divine motion over the will, does agree with Protestants,
and dissent from the Trident Council: and finally their Bishop Martinz says
of this power which we yield unto God, of determining the will; Gratia efficax
non differt ^^ipsa ab excitante, nulla autem gratia excitans habet ex se vim
determinandi physice voluntatem. Martinz de Auxil. Grati^. (...). 2. part. 3.
number. 12. Vt demonstratur ex Conc. Trident. number. 17. Istiusmodi determinatio
idem prorsus est quod necessitas ^^gendo. Ib. part. 4. nu. 9. Physica

and Caluinus intellexerunt posita gratia praedeterminante. Ibid number. 21. and
part. 7. number. 6. He reckons up thirty Schoolmen as assenting.
It does necessarily overthrow the liberty of will.

12 Well then, the confessed consequence is this, viz. whosoever does
acknowledge a divine act so working man's will, that the will cannot resist the
power of grace, but must necessarily obey, does therein deny that liberty of
will which is prescribed in the Council of Trent; which is an ability
indifferently to obey, or not to obey; but Cardinal Bellarmine has found in
their elder School one Tenet lacobus Almainus in Moralib. cap. 1. and 2. Deum
suo concursu determinare voluntatem. Bellarm. quo supra.. Pst igitur.
Almainus, and Suarez notes Illa qualitas, vel motio, aut entitas, aut quouis

13 If therefore (as our Apologists say) the argument drawn from the
confession of Adversaries be strong, how shall the Romanists break this
threefold cord of Louanists, Thomists, and Dominicans, together with others,
who have conclusiuely defended our ground of the divine determination of man's
will? and consequently (as Bellarmine, Suarez, Benius, Martinz have formerly
argued) do overthrow that kind of liberty of the will, which was maintained in
the Romish Church against the doctrine of Protestants. There follows

A confirmation of the last consequence, by a comparison between a confessed
power of Reason and Grace, in determinating the will.
SECT. 6.
14 Cardinal Bellarmine bestows half a Chapter to establish by reason, and
by the consent of diverse Schoolmen, the truth of this position, viz. Probatur

The election of the will does necessarily depend upon the last judgment of
reason, by which it is necessarily determined, as that after all things are
considered, in the end, by the last act of reason, saying, [this must be done]
the will yields, and cannot but consent, and resolve, saying, [this will I
do.] Whereby he has undermined the whole foundation of his former defense: for
if the drawing of the will by the line of a determinated necessity, does (as
they have said) disanull the freedom of will: then reason (which is now
confessed so to ouerrule every deliberate action of will, that it cannot
resist) may be thought to destroy their pretended liberty of will. And indeed
Cardinal Bellarmine by name, is challenged by their own Docet Bellarminus

quod istud ipsum iudicium vltimum and practicum in potestate voluntatis est.]

voluntatis, quod esset radicaliter positam esse in voluntate libertatem. Sed

Benius, either to recant his opinion before specified, or else to yield unto
Protestants their whole cause, concerning the freedom, or rather not freedom
of man's will in spiritual actions of grace.

15 Our argument is this: If (as has been confessed) the act of reason
necessarily determinate the will, then the act of grace may equally necessitate
the will, which disanulleth that indifferency, wherein their Church does place
the liberty: except they shall yield more power unto reason, which is the act
of man's natural spirit, then unto the omnipotent efficacy of the Spirit of
God. We now add

A special inducement, not to rely upon the judgment of Romish Doctors,
among whom diverse patrons of Free Will are found to be associates with
confessed heretics.
SECT. 7.
16 Diverse of our Adversaries who defend Free Will, do confess a necessity
of the grace of God, without which they believe we cannot do well; and presume
thereupon, that their opinion is gracious enough: who whether they admit that
the outward or inward grace of God is necessary in the conversion of man from
sin, yet are they to understand, that (as our Adversaries witness) Pelagius
non negauit priora auxilia, (that is, praedicationis externae, and consiliorum
propositiomi) imo and diuinam reuelationem asseruit: quod existimabat his
proposit ^ho^inem sibi sufficiente^ esse ad credendum, and operandum quicquid
est ad salutem necessarium. -- Quinetiam Pelagius gratiam Dei vtilem esse

the Pelagian heretic did acknowledge the first, and the Semipelagian
professed the other: and therefore notwithstanding this acknowledgement of
necessity of grace, they may have either consanguinitie, or at least affinity
with an ancient heresy.

17 Their Cardinal Bellarmine, that he might remove from his Catholics all
suspicion of but the color of Pelagianisme, says, that Kemnitius scribit,
Catholicos in ea esse sententia, vt liberum a (...) gratiam excitatum excrat
vires quas habebat, etiam antequam excitaretur, and per illas suas vires
vocationi diuinae consentiat, ita vt gratia prae^emens non tribuat vires libero
arbit^io, sed excitet. At hoc non sentiunt Catholici, sed agnoseunt quidem
liberum arbitrium in homine antequam gratia diuina praeueniat, quia liberum
arbitrium res naturalis est, quae per peccatum non amit^itut. Sed tamen nec
dicunt nec sentiunt liberum arbitrium ex se habere potentiam vllam, saltem
proximam ad actus p^otatis, sed eam accipere a Deo per gratiam praeuementem.
Bellar. lib. 6. de lib. arb. cap. 13.
Catholics do not think that man can by his natural power, without the
inward exciting grace, (...)

cause the ancient Fathers and Councels speaking hereof, say, that it works
by an ineffable or unspeakable manner: and also because the metaphorical
phrases of Scripture do intimate, that the divine motion proceeds from
illumination and inspiration. Which evidently euinceth, that the doctrine which
their Jesuit held, and which he defends as the doctrine of their Church, is
contrary unto the profession of ancient Fathers and Councels.

22 We return unto the moral manner of working, which is done by persuasion,
and (to let Ariminensis pass in his by-way from his fellows, wherein, they
say, he walks (...) via in (...) 28. q. 1. (...) inter (...) D^us hominem

alone) we do further demand concerning the efficacy and power hereof,
whether it do so work, as but morally to determine and apply the will to
consent unto the godly motion? This is denied by their Bishop Efficacia gratiae

Martinz, but yet again affirmed by their Jesuit Non repugnat dari
excitationem it a efficacem, vt moraliter praedeterminet volunt atem, vt saepe
contingit in actibus humanis, quando habet homo ^uidens iudicium, rem sibi
expedire, and contrarium esse perniciosum. Item potest Demon ita vehementer
inducere hominem suafionibus suis and suggestionibus, vt nisi grati^ Dei
iu^etur, moralit^r non possit se continere, quin consentiat, ergo multo magis
Deus gratia excitante, etc Suarez Ies. lib. 3. de anxil. great. cap. 10. number. 5.
Suarez, and proved, that sometime the exciting grace is effectual so to
predeter mine the will, as that morally it cannot but consent. Thus by our
Adversaries contradictions we have gained a confession both of a moral
determination, and a physical efficacy of working man's will by Gods exciting
grace.

23 After this discussion of the first kind of grace, which they call exciting,
we are drawn by their disputes to examine the differences of the second part,
which is the helping and assisting grace. But how can we describe this point,
wherein our Adversaries are at a Quid sit gratia adiuuans (or, cooperans) 1.
reipsa ab excitante distingui, -- sed non est admittenda* 2 Gratiam adi^uantem

fiue-fold ods, about which, and what this helping and cooperating grace is? We
may be contented with that definition, which in the last place is set for the
best, viz. to think it to be a concurrence of Gods grace, effectually moving
the will to consent: and not intending to prosecute three other of their

curious questions hereabout, we only point at them in the margent for
Scholars to observe: wherein they shall find nothing but even and odd, yea and
nay, true and false. We rather hasten unto

A fifth consequence taken from the comparison made between Grace and Will,
where our Adversaries do irreligiously equal Will with Grace, and sometime
prefer it; against the confessed doctrine of ancient Fathers.
SECT. 10.
24 If even the very comparison of grace with will, that is, God with man
Gregorius, Capr^o^^^ in 2. did. 28. Soar in 3. p. Tom. 1. disp. 3. Sect. 6.
and alij recentiores. Tum quia voluntas creata inferioris ordinis est, and
proinde suapte vi improportionata ad actus tales (viz. supernatura.) Tum quia,
etc. Tum denique quia Patres liberum arbitriu^ solent appellare instrumentum
diuinae gratiae, simpliciter negant esse agens, principale in negotin salutis.
in the effecting of any good, cannot but become odious unto any religious
Reader; how much more hateful shall it seem to be, when therein we shall
perceive will to be equalled, yea and to be preferred before grace, as in the
writings of some Romanists may appear? For concerning the equality, we read
that although their Gregorius, Caprcolus, Soar, and some other in these days,
thought the will of man to be of an inferior nature, and incompetent, and
unfit to apply it self unto spiritual actions; in which consideration (say
they) the Fathers called will the instrument of grace, and therefore judged
grace to be the principal agent in every action belonging unto salvation: yet
their Bishop Martinz is privileged to advance the will, and to make it^ kind
of principal cause. But why? Verum haec sententia non placet, primo quia ratio
merendi non videtur cadere posse in agens instrume^tale, sed tantum in
principale. And the title of his Secti^^, Homo in operibus bonis quae facit cum
auxilio grat^ae, in suo ordine est causa principalis. But he labors to
reconcile them, and yet therein confesses, Differunt autem, quod little quidam
dicunt ad rationem principalis causae requiri virtutem propriam and
proportionatam, vel eminentioris ordinis quam sit effectos: Alij negaot id esse
necessatium. From these so contrary premises, the conclusions must needs be
contrary. Martinz ib. number. 7. etc A little after, Deus comparatione operum ad
quae opus est speciali Dei auxilio, causa prima sit and principalis
particulari^. -- Homo etiam est illorum causa particularis, and in suo ordine
principalis. Idem ibid. number. 10.
Because (says he) the reason (mark here how the pride of man's will can
plead for it self) of meriting cannot belong to any cause but that which is a
principal. In like sort does their Cardinal Bellarmine proceed to match grace
and will together, by comparing them unto Duo serunt ingentem lapidem, quem
vnus serre non possit: neuter enim alteri vires addit, aut eum impellit, and
vtrique liberum est onus relinquere. -- Sic Deus and voluntas, vt licet in
eodem prorsus momento agere incipiant, tamen Deus operatur, quia voluntas
operatur, non contra. -- Neque tamen sequitur Deum pendere a creatura, sed ab
aeterna sua institutione and voluntate: (A little before) Quoniam ad hoc se
libere quodammodo obligabat, quando naturam creabat. Bellar. lib. 4 de Lib.
arb. cap. 15.
two men carrying one stone, neither of them adding any strength unto the other,
and both free when they will to cast off the burden.

25 As yet man's free will and Gods grace go hand in hand, which makes their
doctrine seem impious; but how sacrilegious will it appear to be, when as
others shall give man's will the upper hand? Of this kind we suspect them to be,
of whom their Martinz testifies, that Sunt qui putant gratiae efficaciam
constituendam esse in actu voluntatis consentientis: and illam gratiam
efficacem esse, cui volunta^ cooperatur, qua volunt illam inefficace^ esse, cui
voluntas ex suo arbitrio non vult cooperari* vnde secundum illos efficacia
gratiae a libero arbitrio pendet. -- Ratio, quia nulla est Dei vocatio, quam
non possit homo pro libito acceptare* aut reijcere. Martinz disp. 3. part. 2.
number. 1.
they think the efficacy of grace to consist in the act of the will, and to
depend upon the liberty of man's will, because in will there remains always
an indifferent ability to receive or reject grace. This speech their foresaid
learned Bishop Sed efficacia gratiae non est constituenda in cooperatione
liberi arbitrij, -- quia Romans 9. Non est currentis: and in 1. Cor. 4. Quiste
discernit? Sane qui gratiam efficeret efficacem, se ipse diceretur decernere.
Ibid. number. 4 and 7. comm^nis sententia hoc tenet: number. 9. Qui sentiunt gratiam
a voluntate pendere, loquuntur de actuali efficacia in actu secundo, nec aliud
volunt quam Dei auxilium ex ^o fac^re consensum, quia liberum arbitrium v^lt ei
cooperari, cum oppositum posset facere. Qui volunt a solo Deo pe^der^, (...) de
efficacis in (...) primo, quia a libero arbitrio non pendet, vt Deus conferat
talem vocationis motionem. Ibid. number. 17.
Martinz, not allowing it, would gladly qualify: but if such a dependence of
grace upon man's will might be admitted, then as God says to all regenerate
men, Without me you can do nothing: so might the will of every man (especially
in respect of acting a consent unto good) reioyne unto God, saying; Without me
thou can do nothing.

26 And doubtless the sentences of their other Romish Doctors do sound unto
the same effect, wherein, in the cooperation and ioynt-working in the act of
consent, they yielded the Dico Deum sequi determinationem voluntatis, quoni^
ideo Deus agit actum ^llum, quia eum volun^a^ agit, and non quia agit volunta^,
Deus agit; and ideo dicitur magis prop^^^ Deus coagere volunta^^ talem actum
causando, quam voluntas dicatur coagere Deo. Greg. Ariminen. in 2. did. 34.
I Would docet Scotus in 2. Sent. did. 37. q. 1. Allowed by Bellarm. lib. 4. de
lib. arb. cap. 14.
more proper causing efficacy unto the will: for with them God, forsooth, does
follow the determination of man's will, and not contrariwise: and they always
loathing to grant God the determining power unto good, pronounce, that Hinc fit
vt voluntas sit vere libera, and se ipsa determinet, tamet^^ Deus eam moueat
and applicet ad optis, quoniam ipsa Dei motio in eius potestate est, sieve (vt
Caietanus loquitur) Dei motione voluntas nostra libere vtitur. Ibid. cap. 16..
Atque.
the motion which God uses for the effecting of consent, is still in the power
of man's will, the will it self determining it self. Which doctrine cannot
possibly make any harmonic in any religious heart: insomuch that their own
Benius may seem to have abhorred it; who being that last author which has
written of this subject, and otherwise a zealous proctor for freewil, does step
a little aside, moved (as he says) by divine scriptures, which Sane cum
diuinae literae clament, Deum omnia opera nostra operatum esse, ac sigillatim
operari omnia in nobis, -- add etiam Deum operari in nobis velle and
perficere: negandum non est Deum ad omnem nostrum actum positiuum,
specialiterque ad supernaturalem, and ad ipsam determinationem voluntatis
nostrae concurrere* quod si concurrit, cur non ipse mecum determinare, seu
potius condeterminare dicetur? Certe diuina Scriptura, quae dicit in vanum nos
aedificare, nisi Deus aedificet, de spirituali aedificatione loquitur imprimis.

proclaim God to work all in all in us, yea both to will and to do that which
is good: that therefore it may not be denied, but that God, especially in
spiritual acts, does concur with man, even to the determining of his will.

27 Whereunto he brings a conformable assent of many ancient Fathers, as
namely Clemens Bishop of Rome, Dionysius Areopag^ta, Theophilus, Basil,
Theodoret, Augustine, Hilarie, Anselme, Chrysostom, Hierome, Athanasius,
Damascen, Gregory Nazianzene, Cyrill; some of them granting, that man's soul
is moved of God in good actions, as an active instrument: and in the end,
although he will not acknowledge God to predetermine, that is, of himself to
restrain the will unto a necessary consent unto good: yet he has brought in
(as he calls it) a condetermination thereof. And thus is he become half
orthodoxall; we wish (as S. Paul did) unto him and all others, that they were
such not in half, but altogether. In the last place we use

A sixth consequence, which makes against the Romish doctrine of Free Will,
which is taken from a confessed instance: whereby our Adversaries (as they are
also by other doubts) are brought into an extreme exigence and strait.
SECT. 11.
28 It is imagined by our Adversaries, that there are two men to be converted,
as for example Peter and Paul, and both of them equally assisted by grace: the
question is, whether (this being their state) the one may be converted, the
other not. For if they can be equally converted, it must be attributed only to
the liberty of man's will: if they cannot be equally converted, then there is
not in the freedom of will that indifferency, which they call liberty, to
reject grace. Among the Romanists, Aliqui Theologi dicunt, non posse dici a
Catholico Theologo, in hac part, ignora^te, quod stante aequah auxilio Dei,
Petrus conuertatur, and non Paulus: nec verentur contrariam sententia
temerariam and Pelagianam appellare. Alij vero Theologi contrariam sententiam
absolute and sine distinctione affirmant. Suarez Ies. lib. 3. de a^xil. great.
cap. 20.
some (as their Jesuit Suarez testifies) say, that it is a rash and heretical
opinion to affirm, that one of them could be converted, and not the other.
Hereby insinuating, that where grace is equal and proportionable, the effect
of consenting must be alike; and so the preeminence of grace may be preserved:
others notwithstanding (says he) do absolutely affirm the contrary, which
they do, no doubt, for the maintenance of free will.

29 Peradventure their learned Jesuits can assoile this by some distinction.
Respondeo, etsi eadem gratia sit, quod attinet ad substantiam motionis, tamen
vni fuit congrua, alteri non congrua, haec enim est singularis Dei gratia, vt
move at hominem, prout videt congruum atque aptum esse Bellar. lib. 6. de lib.
arb. cap. 15. Sententia 9.
Cardinal Bellarmine, Eadem ratione cum eodem seu aequali auxilio per modum
principij stat, vnum hominem conuerti aut poenitere, and non alium: quae ratio
concludit hoc euenire posse non solum hominibus inaequaliter affectis, sed
etiam hominibus eiuldem ingenij: imo etiam inaequaliter dispositis, vt qui
pe^us est dispositus, conuertatur, and alter resistat: -- quamuis hoc ra^^u^
accidat. Suarez quo supra, number. 8. although number. 10. ^e fly unto congruam
vocationem, as does Martinz, who says:
Suarez, and Efficacia gratiae non reducitur in aptitudinem, aut complexionem
peccatoris, tanquam in causam efficientem, sed vt in materialem. Disp 3. part.
4. number. 7.
Martinz, answer, that the reason of the conversion of the one rather then the
other, proceeds from hence, that although the motion of grace be essentially
equal, yet is it made more fit unto the one parties disposition then unto the
others; God by his singular favor (when he purposes to work effectually) so
moving man, as he finds it most agreeable and convenient. But this answer is
confuted by their own Benius, saying, Qui sane anthor etc. (meaning,
Bellarmine, whom he there names) Etsi assentiri cupientem, me quidem tria
magnopere haerentem habent. -- Mutat statum quaestionis: illi enim cui ex se
ista gratia apta est vt persuadeatur, sine dubio est gratia: ita non erit
gratia aequalis. In eadem naui est Franciscus Suarez -- cuius responsum pugnat
cum Conc. Tridentino: dum enim docet Synodus ita offerri gratiam, vt possit
recipi and respui, supponit esse ex se congruam and opportunam. Benius cap. 23.
page 411. and deinceps. His own answer is, Posito aequali auxilio gratiae, and
aequali in duobus hominibus affectione. fieri non potest, vt vnus conuertatur,
and non alius. -- Cum est affectio varia, aliter potest fieri. Idem ibidem.
Although I could willingly assent unto (noting expressly Cardinal Bellarmine)
this author, yet there be three especial reasons which hinder me; one is
because he changes the state of the question, which was, that the two parties
were supported by equal grace: but if God do persuade the one in more fit and
seasonable manner then the other, this being a respect of grace, it makes the
grace unequal.

30 Thus may we see how that when the bent of these our Adversaries wits has
been to plead for the liberty of man's will, they themselves are so fettered in
their own arguments and answers, that not only in every passage each one can
note another insufficiency: but also that, like as men in a maze, by much
turning and winding, they become so impotent, as not to know which way truly
to turn them: so these by their perplexed and intricate subtelties, are so
intoxicate, as that in the end, their Cardinal Bellarmine is driven to answer
to the objection concerning Gods predeterminations of second causes, saying, Si
Deus non omnia praedeterminaret ante praeuisionem secundarum causarum, non
posset omnia certe praescire. Respondeo, res omnino difficilis est, and
fortasse in hac vita incomprehensibilis, etc Bellar. lib. 4. de Lib arb. cap.
15.
This is a very hard point, and peradventure in this life not possible to be
comprehended.

31 So likewise their Doctor Weston, a Professor at Doway, takes upon him the
decision of a principal point, Caeterum superest adhuc, quod mihi saepius
negotiu^ facessit, cuius apertam intelligentiam neminem v^deo adhuc satis
expressisse, aut in eius explicationem animum intendisse: est autem huiusmodi:
(The brief whereof is this) Quae sit primordialis ratio habendi concursum Dei
in hanc determinatam partem. The opinion of some is, that Concursus Dei magis
propendet in vnam partem, quam in aliam, ad modum congruitatis, it. genij, and
cognitionem volentis. -- Haec apertissima ratione pugnare existimo cum libero
arbitrio, at que vnius partis antecedentem necessitatem and fatum inuchere. --
Superest discutiendus ipsemet actus arbitrij: -- Sed pro tenuitate ingenij mei
ita clucidauimus controuersiam alioqui obsenrissimam; cumprimis students rem
maxim probabilem paucisque succinctam in medium proferre; tametsi, vt verum
fatear, neque in istis inquisitioni meae fecerim satis. Westonus de trip. hom.
offic. lib. 3. cap. 10.
which (says he) has much troubled me; the plain meaning whereof I have not
found sufficiently unfolded by any. The point is the reason of the concurrance
of Gods grace with man's will, pretending that he has explaned the most obscure
question; and yet in that confesses that therein he has not satisfied
himself.

32 Lastly, others of them are found De modo quo liberum arbitrium vel mouetur,
velse mouet ad exercitium boni; clamant alij rem nonposse in hac vita percipi,
sed omnem ingenij humani captum superare, Occham and Sa, and Caietaous, and
alij. Benius cap. 20 page 353. in fine.
crying and acknowledging, that the manner of Gods moving of the will passes
the capacity and apprehension of man's wit and understanding: when as else our
Adversaries writing so many and huge volumes upon this one argument of
free will, and professing by their learning and subtlety to satisfy from
point to point, yet are in the end enforced to confess it a matter impossible;
what does it import, but that all this while with lost labor they have been
turning an Ixions wheel, and tumbling Sisyphus his stone? Nothing now
remains, but that unto these premises we affixe

Our conclusion by way of Appeal.
SECT. 12.
33 If therefore the importunity of the Apologists, in vpbraiding Protestants
with opposition against some Fathers in the question of free will, wherein the
same censure of Protestants has been justified by many learned. 1.
Jesuits, may convince these obiectors of inconsiderate boldness:

34 If many express sentences of the Fathers themselves, who are acknowledged
by. 3.
Jesuits to have defended, that by the fall of the first man all mankind (as
the prodigal child lost his substance) lost the freedom of will, may be
thought to patronize our cause:

35 If the judgment of their Godfridus, Aegidius, Gregory, Gabriel,
Paludanus, Caietane, in. 5.
confessing that the will is not absolutely active, be, as Cardinal Bellarmine
has said, to deny their pretended freedom of will:

36 If that the. 5. and. 6.
consent of their Louanists, Thomists, Dominicans, and others, teaching that
Gods operative and active grace determinateth and applies the will unto good,
do (as their Jesuits have concluded) undermine the liberty of will defined and
defended in the Council of Trent:

37 If, of the defenders of free will,. 7. and. 8.
some believed not the necessity of grace: which doctrine is condemned (by
Jesuits) of Pelagianisme; Ibidem.
some denied that God can absolutely determine the will, and are confuted by
the most part; some disliked, that God should be said by his exciting grace to
work physically in man, and are gainsaid by their Benius, as therein
adversaries unto Fathers and Councels;. 9. and. 10.
some held that God does not morally determine the will, and are excepted
against by their Suarez; some gave to man's will, in the act of conversion, an
equality, yea the pre-eminence before grace, and are therefore contradicted by
others, as repugnant unto Scriptures and Fathers; and finally,. 11.
some labored to satisfy all doubts concerning the concurrance of grace and
will, and yet confessing that they cannot assoile them, are confuted by
themselves:

38 If all these may prejudice either our Adversaries judgment, or the
sincerity of their consciences, then has our Reader sufficient warrant to
except against the Romish doctrine of the freedom of natural will, in the
state of man's corruption before his conversion, by discerning it to be but a
bastard, and bondslaue by the thraldom of sin; knowing that a natural agent
has no more proportionable power in it self to apply it self unto any godly
motion, which is a spiritual object, then can a dead carcass raise it self
unto life. And if that Genesis 21. 9.
Ismael, Hagars seed, even this natural will of corruption, shall laugh and
mock at actual grace, as at Jacob the child of promise, and think himself
to be as free as he; then let us remember the voice which spoke, saying, Cast
out the bondwoman and her son, for she cannot be heir with the freeborn.
Doubtless so it is, grace and will cannot be both heirs and principals in the
act of man's conversion unto the state of regeneration. And whether in this case
we are rather to stand unto Gods side, or unto man's, let any conscience judge.
We conclude (to omit Alij forta^^e minus trib^^nt l^bero a^bitrio quam

but to ascribe all good unto grace: because that albeit a man may without
impiety take from the power of nature and free will, to give it unto Gods
grace, yet may it be dangerous to attribute unto nature that which is proper
unto grace. Wherefore although our Adversaries shall say of themselves, in
respect of their will unto God (be this spoken by way of a spiritual allusion)
We are Act. 22. 28.
freeborn; yet will it be our safety rather to confess, that with a great
power and price we obtained our freedom.

CHAP. XI. Of the Merit of good works.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
6 Sixthly, as concerning Free Will, and Merit of works, M. D. H^^frey says,
Humfred. Iesuitismi pa^. 2. page 530. a^te med And concerning the confesled
doctrine of Merit of Works in Clemens Alexandrinus, Theophylus, Cyprian.
Iustine Martyr, etc. See Abraham ^^^ltetus vbi supra, page 48. ante med. and
122. post med. and 151. post med. And the Century writers, Cent. 2. c. 4. and
Cent. 3. c. 4.
It may not be denied but that Irenaeus, Clemens, and others (quos vocant
Apostolicos) called Apostolical (in respect of the time in which they lived)
have in their writings the opinions of Free Will, and of Merit of works.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First arguing between the dependence of Free Will
and Merit.
SECT. 1.
IT is no incongruitie that merit and free will be matched together, because
merit has so great a dependence upon free will, that out Adversaries (to wit,
Cardinal Bellarmine, the Rhemish translators, Castro, (...)

possibility of desert thus used by these Fathers, to wit, Basil, Chrysostom,
Hierome, Augustine, Hilarie, Ambrose, Gregory, Bernard, do so inuincibly
fortify the doctrine of Protestants against the property of merit and desert
of man's work, that this their profession may well seem to need no other
Apology then these determinations of Fathers. Manet sempiterna ^equies illis
in hac vita, qui legitime certarunt, non tanquam debitum operibus redditum, sed
ob munificentissimi Dei gratiam, in quo spe^a runt. Basil. in Psalm. 114.
Eternal life (say they) is reserved for all such as shall accomplish their
spiritual fight, not as a reward of debt, but as a gift of Gods munificence.
Non quod eo dignus sim, sed propter benignitatem tuam. Idem in Psalm. 143. 12.
Not by man's worthiness, but by Gods bounty. Hoc est gratis propter nomen
tuum, non propter meritum nicum: qui a tu dignaturus es hoc facere, non quia
ego dignus, cui facias August. in Psalmu^.
Not because man deserves it, but because God vouchsafes it. Deus remuneratur
hominem secu^dum opera. Greg. see above, lib. 1. cap. 2.. 11.
Not for the work sake, but according to the work. Finally (which is the
vp-shot) Digni nos sumus, sed ipsius dignatione, non dignitate nostra.
Bernaerd. in dedic. Eccles. sermon. 5. Neque talia sunc hominum merita, vt
propter ea vita aeterna debeatur ex iure, aut Deus iniuriam faceret, nisi eam
donaret. Idem in Annunciat. sermon. 1. Sufficit ad meritum scire, quod non habeo
merita. Idem in Cant. sermon. 68. Si proprie appellentur ea merita, quae dicimus
nostra, spei quidem sunt ^eminaria, charitatis incentiua, occultae
praedestinationis indicia, futurae felicitatis praesagia, via regni non causa
regnandi. Idem de libero Arbitrio and Gratia.
Not as a cause, but as a way of attaining unto Gods kingdom. Yet we
furthermore manifest,

That ancient Fathers as they did commend this doctrine unto men in their
public writings, so did they likewise confess it unto God in their private
devotions: by the confession of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 6.
12 The ordinary doctrine of the Romish School is, to place their confidence
in the merit of those good works which are done of men whilst they continue in
the state of grace: and where they find in authors the contrary caveat, that
is, Deleantur illa verba: Credis non proprijs meritis, sed Domini Christi
virtute and merito ad gloriam peruenire. Index Hispanicus ad lit o. in librum
qui inscribitur O^do baptizandi, page 149. See the like in the Index Expurg.
apud Iunium, upon Stapulensis and others.
not to trust in our own merits, such admonitions they command to be bl^tted
out.

13 But Protestants although they believe and profess, that the cup of cold
water, even the least good work shall receive an inestimable reward of bliss;
yet teach they men always divinely to discern between their own
unworthiness in the best actions, and Gods gracious acceptance of the least
good of man's imperfect obedience: imitating herein the examples of those
ancient Fathers, whom Henricus Kispinigius Venlonensis Canonicus. Antuerp.
1583. in his book entitled, Aquae viuae de fontibus saluatoris.
Kispinigius a Romish author has recorded to have been very devout in this
kind: where Ambros. sermon. 20. super Psalm. 118. verse. Vide humilitatem meam.
Nemo sibi arroget, nerro de meritis glorietur, nerro de potestate se iactet,
sed omnes speremus per D. Jesus misericordiam inuenire, quoniam omnes ante eius
tribunal stabi^^i: de illo indulgentiam postulabo, quae enim spe^ alia
peccatoribus? Et qui se aurum habere put at habet plumbum, and qui granum
tritici, habet paleam, quae possit exuri. Ib. lib. 5. cap. 13.
Ambrose presenting himself before the throne, professes saying; I will call
for mercy, for there is no other hope. S. August. Confess. lib. 9. cap. 13.
Vae etiam laud^bili vitae. 6 remota misericordia discutias eam, Domine. Et in
exp. Psalm. 142. Ne intres in iudicium cum seruo tuo, Domine, etc. Quantumlibet
enim mihi rectus videar, producis tu tamen de thes^uro tuo regulam, and coaptas
me ad eam, and pra^^s inuenior Ibid. Fateor quis peccaui, and conscientia mea
meretur damnationem, and poenitentia mea non sufficit ad satisfactionem: sed
certum est quod misericordia tua super at omnem offen^ionem. Noli igitur
intrare in iudicium, etc. Ibid. cap. 9.
Augustine praying, says: Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord,
for although I seem unto my self straight, yet thou Lord, drawest out of thy
treasures a rule to measure me, whereby I am found crooked: my conscience
says, I have deserved damnation, but thy mercy surmounteth the guilt of mine
offense. Accordingly S. Cyprianus Martyr: Rogo Domine, subuoni mihi, noli me
secundum actu^meum iudica^^^ nihil ^nim praeceptis tuis pa^ui: exaudime
orantem, sicut exaudisti Iona^ de ventre Ceu, and cijcics me de morte ad vitam.
Ibid. cap. 20.
Cyprian makes himself, as it were, another Jonas, willing to be cast over
board, and praying not to be judged according to his offense. Answerably to the
rest, S. Hieronymus, Ecce vi^um, qui descendens a Ierusal^m in Ie^icum, captus
a latronibus, and vulneratus, and semiui^us relictus est: tu pie Samaritane,
recipe me, peccaui enim nimis in vita mea, and malum coram ^e ^eci Ibid. cap.
21. Thomas Aquinas: O pie Pellicane, Jesus Domine, me immundum munda tuo
sanguine, cuius vna stilla totum mundu^ saluum facere possit, ab omni ^^elere.
Jerome takes upon him the person of the wounded man lying in his gore-bloud,
and flies by prayer unto Christ, saying, Thou gracious Samaritane, etc.

14 After these Fathers, their foresaid author produces their Aquinas, the
father of their School, with this supplication unto Christ: O quam dura mihi
sunt ista quae loquor, quia memeti^sum in coquendo serio ^dicam tamen vt contra
me ^nnet verbum Dei (...): ^go meipsum reum esse no^ abnego, torpotem meu^
video; ^ortasse erit apud pium Iud cem impetratio veniae, ipsa agnitio clupae
Greg. Magnus de munere Pastoris, and lib. 1. hom. 11. super Ezech. 33.
O thou merciful Pellicane, Lord Jesus, purge me with thy blood, one drop
whereof is sufficient for all our sins. Unto these might be added the like
breathings of S. Gregory acknowledging his own guilt, and S. Bernard desiring
his then living friends Orate Saluatorem, qui non vult mortem peccatoris, vt
tempestinum ^am. exitum non differat, sed custodiat: curate muni^e votis
calcaneum nudum meritis, vt is qui insidiatur inuen^^e non possit, vnde figat
dentem, and vulnus instigat. Bernardus e^ist. 310.
to fortify his heel (that is, the ending of his life) void of merit, with
their prayers, that the serpent might not have wherein to six his tooth.

15 Not that such servants of God can be said to have been void of good works,
but that they examining such their metals by touch, and by weight, found them
too light and imperfect to deserve the proper name of merit. Yet such have
always been the prayers of holy men, not only of those whom man, but even of
those also whom the mouth of God has canonized and saincted. But what need we
multiply examples, especially in a case so true and evident, that it may be
observed in all the faithful, that the most worthy servants of God have
always been most ready to acknowledge their own unworthiness?

16 Neither may that be called an answer, which their Cardinal Bellarmine has
framed unto himself, whereby he would satisfy an objection viged from the
testimony of S. Bernard: Fortasse Bernardus tum ex humilitate, quae prop^ia
merita ignorant, tum ex incertitudine propriae gratiae prudentei non confidebat
in meritis suis, sed in sola misericordia: -- sed non i seo merita non habebat,
quia merita sua non agnoscebat. Bellar. lib. 5. de Iustif. cap. 6. in fine.
Peradventure S. Bernard (says he) denying that he had any merits, did it in
humility, or upon the uncertainty of his proper grace; so that it does not
follow that he had them not, because he did not acknowledge them. For this
imagination fights against the express doctrine of S. Bernard, as their own
Vega has alleged him: Et Bernardus: Nostra, si qua est, humilis iustitia,
recta forsitan, sed non pura, nisi forsitan nos inchores esse credimus quam
Patres nostros, qui non minus veraciter quam humiliter dixerunt, Omnes
iustitiae nostrae tanquam pannus menstruatae mulieris. Vega lib. 15. de Iustif.
cap 13. page 698.
The justice which is in us, (says S. Bernard) is peradventure true, but yet
impure, except we shall think our selves better then our fathers, who, no
less truly then humbly, confessed their justice to be no better then a
menstruous cloth. Their Cardinal does suppose that S. Bernard confessed rather
in humility then in truth, contrary unto S. Bernard, who professes to keep
the footsteps of his forefathers, who acknowledged their unworthiness no less
truly then humbly. As for the other answer of uncertainty of his proper grace,
it does no more prove that he would deny that he had merits, then it does
confess that he had them; because uncertainty in the one does imply an
uncertainty in both. And it is certain that S. Bernard, as he was truly
humble, so was he humbly true, acknowledging no more in himself, then he
taught to be common to all others, to wit, that our works are so far off
from being properly meritorious, that, indeed, we ought to deem them in their
own nature to be no better then menstruous. We now pass from the Fathers, to
confer a little with our Adversaries, and prove

That the denying of the merit and worthiness of our best works, is much more
safe then is the now Romish profession: proved by the consequences and
confessions of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 7.
17 It were no great difficulty for us, from the confessed principles of
learned Jesuits and others, to ruinate the foundation of this their Merit; and
this might also be thought expedient, if it were not reserved for a particular
In the third part Apologiae Catholicae, hereafter (God wiling) to be published.
Treatise: yet may we afford our godly Reader a taste in one example of M.
Weston, lately professor at Doway; who perusing the disputes of Gregory de
Valentia, a Jesuit universally reverenced and applauded by all of that
religion, and perceiving him so to value the good works of men regenerate, as
judging the excellency of them (in themselves, without the supposed promise of
God) to be unworthy of eternal life, does infer (and truly,) that Multum
tame displicet quod Greg. de Valenti^ ^ensit. 1. 2. q. de eff^ctu Great. disp.
8. punct 4. qui seclusa hac gratuira Dei pollicitati^ne (quae ad aeternae vitae

it must follow hereupon, that no work of a just man has truly any
condignitie (that is, proper Merit, and equal worthiness) with any heavenly
reward: and in fine concludes, that this sentence does iumpe with the doctrine
of Protestants, who teach (as their Cassander testifies out of the testimony
of Bucer a Protestant,) that Ingenue agnouit Bucc^us: Si Deus (inquit)
iudicaturus est vnumquem que secundum opera sua, cert^ bona opera in vera side
and charitate facta ad salutem sunt necessaria: vt ^uis Deus respectu bonorum
operum temporariam and aeternam mercedem ^^rgitur, non quidem ex dignitate
ope^um in se, etc. -- Si sancti Patre^ (inquit) aut alij intelligant per,
mere^i, facere ex fide gratiae Dei bona opera, ex quibus Deus mercedem promisit
and rependet: hoc sensu vsurpare illud verbum minime damnabimus. Cassander
Consult. Art. 6.
seeing God will judge men according to their works, good works must be held
necessary unto salvation; yet so, as not to attribute the reward to the
worthiness of the works, but unto the favor of Gods promise: in which sense
(says M. Bucer) the use of the word Merit may be admitted. But under that word
to convey into men's hearts an opinion of condignitie, and proper worthiness,
is (we think) but that leaven of superstition, which is able to sour the
whole lump of the best action.

18 We may furthermore demand of their Cardinal Bellarmine, who being brought
now at length by the evidence of the truth to confess, that Propter
incertitudinem ^ropriae iustitiae, and periculum inanis gloriae, tutissimum est
fiduciam totam in sola Dei misericordia and benignitate reponere. Bellar. lib.
5. de Iustif. cap. 7. prop. 3.
it is the safest for Christians not to put their confidence in merits, but in
the sole mercy and favor of God: why confessing a danger in man's confidence
in merit, he should not likewise acknowledge danger in their conclusion and
doctrine of merit: that is, why he should not instruct men as well to trust and
believe, that there is no merit in them, as not to trust unto merit? For se^ing
their faith teaches, that every man must merit heaven, then their hope (which
is the daughter of faith) must necessarily trust and expect to be saved by
merit. Wherefore our desire is, that our Adversaries would proportion their
faiths unto their hopes, especially if their hope be that which their Cardinal
holds to be the safest, which is, to put confidence only in Gods grace, and
not in the worthiness of works. But what need we insist upon the consequence
of their arguments, seeing we have

The confessions of our Adversaries, directly and largely (with Protestants)
disclaiming the Romish article of Merit?
SECT. 8.
19 Although the doctrine of that Church is, that every good work done by a
regenerate Christian, is Nostra opera proprie merentur felicitatem de condigno.
Bellarm. lib. 5. de Iustif. And aagaine, Opera bona iustorum meritoria esse
vitae aeternae ex condigno, non solum ratione pacti and acceptationis, sed etia
ratione operis, ita vt in opere bono ex gratia procedente sit quaedam proportio
and aequalitas ad praemiu^ vitae aeternae. Bellarm. ibid. cap. 17.. Iam vero.
And Pererius the Jesuit, Si bona iustoru^ opera spectentur and pensitentur ea
ratione, vt proficiscuntur a Spiritu sancto per gratiam iusti hominis animam
inhabitantem, ea profect^ conuenientem habent proportionem aequalitatis and
dignitatis cum praemio ipso vitae aeternae. Comment. in Romans 6. number. 55. page
710.
properly meritorious, that is, of worth to deserve eternal life: which their
Jesuit Coster expresses thus, Vt clare perspiciatur non minus (...)
actionibus aeternam felicitatem prometeri quam mihi (...)gitiosis aeterna
supplicia. Costerus Ies. Enchirid. Tra^^ de Meritis.
By good works (says he) we do as properly merit eternal blessedness, as we
do by wicked deeds deserve eternal torments; which doctrine was first made an
article of faith by their last Council of Trent, wherein every one is
pronounced an Si quis dixerit iustificati hominis opera bona non vere mereri
vitam aeternam, Anathema sit Council Trid Sess. 6. cap. 16. can. 32.
Anathema, who denies that the good works of holy men do truly merit
everlasting life: yet was this so undoubtedly no universal doctrine in the
Church of Rome even of later times, that our country man Waldensis, living in
the days of K. Henry the fifth, and specially commended by the then Breue
Apostolicum Martini Quinti -- dilecto filio Thomae Waldensi, etc.
Pope, by whose Breue he was excited to write against Wicleffe; does, in
confutation of the Romish distinction of merit of condignitie and congruitie,
pronounce, that Haec ipsa determinatio Scripturarum -- cong(...)us iungeretur
locutionibus de meritis hominum quam absolute iungeretur vel diceretur quod
homo ex meritis est dignus regno (...)o^um, aut hac gratii, vel illa gloria,
quamuis quidam Scholastici inuenerunt ad hoc dicendum termin^^ de condigno and
congruo. -- ^usti dicit Apostolus, non sunt condignae passiones, etc. -- Quid
hoc iam vt sic mereamur de congruo? Rep^^o igitur saniorem Theologum,
fideliorem Catholicum, and Scripturis sacris magis concordem, qui tale meritum
simpliciter abnegat, and cum modificatione Apostoli and Scripturatum concedit,
quia simpliciter quis non meretur regnum coelorum, sed ex gratia Dei, aut
voluntate largitoris. -- Nam meritorum nostrorum in articulo mortis (...) Deus
attendit, sieve rationem congrui, vel condigni; sed gratiam suam aut
misericordiam suam. Q^omodo ergo non ad (...) Saluatoris and gratuiti
coronatoris accedit, quod gratia eius tacita tantum disputamus de meritis? Tho.
Waldensis, Tom 6 Sacrament. tit. 1. cap. 7. fol. 30. b.
He is a more sound Divine and firm Catholic, who does simply reject such a
merit: adding, that in the hour of death God will not regard man's merit
(properly taken) whether of Condignitie or Congruitie; but his own good will,
grace, and mercy. And of Durandus, whom our Adversaries note to have been
Durandus vir doctistimus. (...)aeus in 1. Tim. 5. digross. 5.
a most learned man, their Cardinal Bellarmine has confessed, saying, that
Dur^ndus* Opera nostra, inquit, non sunt meritoria de condigno, nisi largo modo
sumpto hoc vocabulo, ita vt hoc condignum respectu condign^ propri^ accepti,
d(...) possit congruum. Bellar. lib 5 de Iustif cap 16.. Alij volunt.
Durand denied that our good works can be esteemed properly meritorious by way
of condignitie.

20 Besides these, Gregory Ariminensis, Brugensis, and especially the choice
and fierce adversary against Protestants, Ecchius, did all hold (as their
Grego^ius Arminensis tenet, nullum esse meritum nobis de condigno, respect^
beatitudinis: idem tenet Marsilius, and Brugensis est in eadem sententia.

and q. 4. page 782.
Vega witnesses) that there is no merit in man condign, that is, justly
worthy of blessedness. Unto these may be added the Romish Achilles in the
days of M. Luther, their Doctor Albertus Pigghius, who in the question of
Justification without inherent righteousness, is noted by Cardinal Concerning
the maetter of Justification, not by the perfection of inherent righteousness,
but by imputation through faith, Bellarmine ^aith, In eandem sententiam, seu

Protestants teach, that Saints departed may not be innocated, or properly
prayed unto. Contrary-wise the last Romish Council has decreed that this
assertion is Mandat sancta syno^us omnibus Episcopis, and caeteris docendi

profession of faith, has bound the Romanists Constanter teneo -- Sanctos cum

constantly to believe the Article of the invocation of Saints. Which now
comes to be examined, first from the judgment of antiquity, showing

Our Adversaries abusiue pretenses of antiquity.
SECT. 2.
3 First, if all the books, alleged by our Adversaries for proof of
Invocation, which carry in their titles, the names of ancient Fathers, could
be admitted for legitimate, then more might be said for the antiquity of
Invocation: but seeing that many such writings appear not only by exceptions
used by D. Fulk takes exception unto Ephrem, and that Athanasius in sermon.
Euang. de deipara, in his Annot. in Rhem. Testament upon 2 Pet 1. 15.
Protestants, but even by the confessions of our learned Adversaries, to be
falsely so instiled, by the names of Bellarmine ^biecteth for Invocation,

1. wherereas himself in diverse places confesses, Athanasij opera pleraque
esse supposititia: and Nanius a professor at Louaine* affirms as much of this
Sermon de Annunciat. in his Preface in Athanas.
Athanasius, Others object Origenis Lamentationes: which book Pope Gelasiu^
rejects as Apocryphal writings, did. 15. cap. Sancta Romana: and Origenis

it is necessary that they abate of their accounts of the witnesses of

principio suae be atitudinis, quae ad ipsos aliquo modo pertinent -- Alij solum
tunc reuelari ij^ a Deo oratione^ nostras quum eas fundimus -- Prior est
simpliciter probabilior, quia si indigerent sancti noua reuelatione, Ecclesia
non diceret ita audacter [Orate pro nobis,] sed peteret aliquando a Deo, vt ei^
preces nostras reuelaret -- tamen posterior sententia est magis idonea ad
conuincendos haereticos. -- Sed dices, -- cur patribus in Limbo non
reuelabantur preces viuentium, si nunc reuelantur in coelo? Respondeo, tunc non
fuisse ordinary ijs reuelatum quid hic agebatur, quia non erant beati. Bellar.
lib. 1. de beat Sanct. cap. 20. Vbi notandum est, quod ante Christi aduentum,

Exodus
Why the people of God in the old Testament did not use to pray unto the Saints
departed, as thus, [holy Abraham pray for us,] but only were accustomed to
call upon God: he answers, that therefore they were not prayed unto, because
they could not ordinarily know the prayers of the living then; and that they
knew not men's prayers, because they were not then in heaven, and in the state
of blessedness.

5 Whence it may be collected, that seeing those Saints, who are but only in
the outward court of heaven, and not in the chamber of presence, enjoying the
blessed fight of their God, and of the Lamb; are not to be inuocated: and
consequently those Fathers (which are Te^tullianus, Origenes, Irenaeus,
Chrysostom. Theodor. Occumen. Theophylactus, Ambrosius sententiae huic assensi
sunt, quae negat animas frui diuina visione ante resurrectionem. Stapleton.

confessed to have been both many, and very ancient) who denied that the
Saints of the new Testament do yet enjoy that perfect state of blessedness,
must be thought not to have allowed of the ordinary use of the invocation of
Saints; whatsoever our Adversaries shall answer hereunto, must necessarily
prove their own greater For if they did not approve that use, then we ask why
they are produced as patron^ thereof? If they did, but yet as erring herein, by
thinking that souls which enjoy not beatifiea visione, ought to be usually
prayed unto* then do they* by douying their authority in an half, ^each men a

6 Thirdy, none will deny, but that religious prayer is the natural child of
Iac. 1. Let him pray in says: -- for he that doubreth etc
faith, and that faith receives her offspring by the virtue of an infallible
truth: but Invocation, (even that which we disprove) in the first hatching of
it, was delivered but in these doubtful terms of, S^ dixe^i^ Sancto^ curam
gerere nostrae ^^lu^^s, and pro nobis orare, non erit inconueniens. Orig. lib.
in Cant cap. 2. in h^c verba, Ordinate charitatem, ^go sic arbitror, eos qui

if a man shall say so, or, it is not inconvenient to say so; or, as I suppose;
or, if he have any sense of our prayer. This was the nature of it whilst it
was yet but an Embryon, as now has appeared by Origin, whom notwithstanding
our learned Adversary Sanctos iam in coelo inuocandos esse, vt pro nobis
orent. -- Asserunt Patres Graeci, Origene^ anno 230. (...) Thesaur. Cont^^u^r.
tom. 1. lib. 5. art. 6.
Coccius produces for the first Father that has patronized this Invocation,
when as yet he professes to confirm the doctrine of all Romish articles now
controuerted, by the current of all antiquity. Which may be unto us an
evidence, that this their doctrine neither was primitiuely ancient, which can
find no direct Father of it before Origin, who lived 230. years after Christ;
nor yet any doctrine of faith, which had then no better a foundation then if,
and I suppose, etc.

7 Fourthly, there was a long time after Origin, before this bird was so full
fethered, as to be used in the public Liturgies of the Churches by a solemn
invocation of any Saint: which we may the rather presume to be true, because
their foresaid Doctor Coccius could not allege any example hereof, whe^as
notwithstanding he is not sparing to prove, that Sanctos in coelo triumphantes,
pro nobis or are: -- Asserunt variarum Gentium ^^turgiae: Romana a Petro
conscripta, -- Domine, miserationes tuas nobis ^agire intercessionibus sanctae
Dei genit^icis, and omnium sanctorum tuorum: and Liturgia alia Romans vltra annos

and Mediolanensem a S. Barn^ba: and post ab Ambrosio (...). (...) Coccius
Th^saur. qu^ supra, Art. 4.
the Saints triumpha^t do pray for us, by (as he calls them) most ancient
Liturgies, as of Rome, Jerusalem, Aethiopia, and Millane; wherein there is not
any voice of praying unto Saints in heaven, that they may pray unto God for the
good of souls, but only that they on earth do pray unto God to hear the
prayers of his glorified Saints, in behalf of the members of the militant
Church: which is no direct invocation of Saints, but unto God: wherein there
can be no danger of Idolatry.

8 As for diverse kind of prayers made by Fathers in some panegyricall or
funeral orations, at the praising of the then departed, by way of a
Rhetorical Such was that Rhetorical Apostrophe of S. Hierom unto Paul^ in his
funeral oration: Vale, o Paula, and cultoris tui vltimam senectutem precibus

it, not that they did, but that if they should pray for the living. And is not
the very like tenor of supposition used by the Apostle? If an Angel from
heaven shall preach any other thing besides that which you have received, hold
him accursed. This does not import, that therefore some Angel from heaven
either could, or did use to preach any extrauagant doctrine, but (as* their
Jesuit Gal. 1. Si Angelus Euangeli^auent praeter id, etc. Est Hyperbolies
loqu^tio, and or atio conditionalis, ac vera, -- quamuis nec antecedens, nec
consequens sit possibile. Salmeron Ies. in (...) locum.
Salmeron truly notes) it is spoken by an hyperbole and excess, signifying
that although (to suppose a thing impossible) an Angel should so preach, yet
he were to be held accursed.

15 But why do we spend time in confutation of other arguments wrested from the
texts of the old Testament? Their Jesuit Salmeron will make up our conclusion,
Patriarchae in veteri Testamento nondum ^rant beati, ideo nihil de hac re
habetur expr^ssum. Salmeron Ies. comment. in 1. Tim. 2. disp. 2. art 7..
Primum. And again: Respondeo, non fuisse in more, in veteri Testamento adeundi
Sanctos intercessores, quia nondum erant ^eati, nec tantus illis honos
debebatur, vt nunc defunctis, and erat periculum idololatriae. Salmeron Iesu^ta
ibid. disp. 8.
The Patriarchs of the old Testament (says he) were not in the state of
blessedness before the coming of Christ; therefore is there nothing expressly
written in the old Testament of Invocation of souls departed, neither was this
honor due unto them for fear of Idolatry. Thus far concerning the old
Testament: we in the second place pass on to the new, proving likewise

That there is no express direction for their Invocation out of the new
Testament, until we come unto the Apocalypse: even by the confessions of our
learned Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
16 First, the good servant is promised a reward of blessedness, Matthew. 24.
46. even to be placed our all that his Lord has. This, in the opinion of their
Cardinal, and of another Jesuit, must signify, that Matthew. 24. 46. Beatus
ille seruus, quem, cum venerit, inuenerit sic facientem, Amen, dico, constituet
cum super omnia.] id est, super Ecclesiam vt Pastorem. Ergo per Sanct^s
Ecclesiam protectione c^tinua conseruat, and Sancti ante resurrectionem
accipiunt potestatem regendi Ecclesiam. Bellar. lib. 1 de bo^^, Sanct. cap.
28.. Idem etc. and. Quarto quia. And Coster. Ies. Enchirid. cap. 14.
Saints, after their departure, are made protectors of the Church (meaning the
milita^t Church of Christ) whereas, indeed, by the context it is plain, even in
the judgment of their Jesuit Maldonate, that it is Haec est expheano
praecedentis parabolae, verse 23. [Super multa constitue^ eum] qua part di biu^
non est secundu^ Chr^sti aduentu^ significari qui longo post tempor^ futurus
erat, etc. Mald. Ies. com in Matthew. 25. 31. and v. 19. etc.
an explanation of the Parable going before, cap. 25. 19. where it is said [a
long time after will his Lord come] whereby, doubtless is meant the second
coming of Christ. And in the same Chapter it is said, When his Lord shall come.
The error then of their former objection is a misapplying of the text unto the
time before the resurrection: which cannot be understood, but of the second
coming of Christ.

17 Secondly, S. Paul, Romans 2. pronounces glory, honor, and (according to
the vulgar Latin) incorruption unto every one that works good. Hence their
Cardinal frames his argument, concluding, that therefore Ro^. 2 ^loriam,
honore^, incorruptione^ omni operanti bonum Frgo Sanctis debetur a nobis honor
religio^^^. Bellar. lib 1 de beat. Sa^ct. cap. 13.. Denique.
there is religious honor and worship due from us unto the Saints; never
regarding that the Apostle speaks not of an honor to be performed of us in
this life, but of that eternal and consummate blessedness of soul and body,
which they shall enjoy in the resurrection of the just, as their own Jesuit
Loquitur de die iudicij, and significat aeterna bona cum animi and corporis
incorruptione coniuncta. Pererius Ies. in cum locum. And the Rhemists by
Honor, understand Celestial blessedness. upon the same place.
Pererius has truly collected out of the text.

18 Thirdly, S. Peter 2. Epist. 1. 15. writing unto the dispersed Christians,
(according unto the English translation of the Rhemists,) says, I will do my
diligence you to have often after my decease also, that you may keep a memory
of these things: which words their Jesuits Salmeron, Suarez, and Bellarmine do
judge for their purpose, In 2. Pet. 1. 15 Dabo operam frequenter vos habere
post obitum meum, vt horum memoriam faciatis.] Quibus ostenditur Sanctos
defunctos cognoscere preces viuentium. Salmeron Ies. in 1. Cor. 13. disp. 21.
Sunt egregia verba Petti, quibus hoc probemus. Suarez Ies. tom. 2. page 250. q.
17. disp. 23.. 2. Bellar. lib. 1. de beat. Sanct. cap. 18. Quomodo autem dabit
operam, nisi orando and precando? Salmeron Ies in locum Petri.
excellent to prove, that Peter after his departure would remember them: and
this must needs be (say they) by praying for them. We may answer, (not to stand
upon their bad Latin, and worse English translation) that the true
constructio^ of the words is, that S. Peter promises to Dabo opera^, id est,
ordinabodum sum in via vt vos habeatis post mortem meam libros, qui vobis haec
in memoriam reuocent, vt horum memoriam habeatis, id est, doctrinam meam
impleatis. Ca^etanus Cardin. in ^um locum.
provide whilst he is in the way (that is in this life) that they should have
his books (namely, his Epistles) which after his departure might put them in
mind of such things: So says their Cardinal Caietane; which their Aquinas
expresses in other words, Dabo operam, ni^irum, Dum viuo, commonendo vos, etc.
Aquinas in ^um locum.
I will do my diligence whilst I live, in warning you, etc. And is as much as
if he had said (says their Jesuit Salmeron,) Quasi dicat, vt post obitum meum
possitis horum frequenter meminisse Emmanuel Sa Ies. in ^um locum.
I will endeavor that after my departure you may have these things in frequent
remembrance: and this sense their Gagnaeus calls an Dilucida explicatio.
Gagnaeus in cum locum.
evident interpretation. We see then their objection to pretend, that S. Peter
after his departure out of this life would remember them: our answer from their
Doctors is, that Saint Peter intended to provide that after his departure they
might remember him in his doctrine. And what can the words do his diligence
else signify? In earth we know there is a place for care and diligence, and in
heaven all tears (whereby is signified all care and pains) are wiped away. In
this question we again appeal unto their own Jesuit Salmeron, who says,
that Nihil de hac re inuenitur in Epistolis Pauli, vel Canonicis, atque
Catholicis aliorum, quae ob alias speciales materias scriptae fuerunt. Salmeron
Ies. com. in 1. Tim 2. disp. 2. art. 7.. Primum.
there is not any thing found either in the Epistles of S. Paul, or of S. Peter
for this purpose: and therefore does take his flight unto the book of the
Apocalypse, where, he says, there is occasion of this doctrine: which is next
to be examined, we proving

That the Invocation of Saints departed is not revealed in the book of
Revelation: from the confession of our Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
19 S. John in his Revelation cap. 6. tells us of the Saints under the Alter,
which cry unto Christ for revenge upon them that spilt their blood: whereupon
Cardinal Bellarmine and Ecchius argue thus; In Apocalypsi vero, vbi erat locus
scribendi futuros successus Ecclesiae per modum prophetiae, and praesertim
status gloriae ^am inchoatus expr^st habetur, vt Apoc 6 10. Animae
interfectorum sub Altari clamant, Vindica sanguinem nostrum de ijs qui
inhabitant terram.] Salmeron Ies. ibid. disp. 7.. Sed cum. Si animae sanctorum
Martyrum vindictam petunt de interfectoribus, ergo multo magis misericordiam
petunt pro fratribus suis. Bellar. lib. 1 de beat. Sanct. cap. 18.. Locus 6.
and Salmer. Ies. in the place alreadi^ cited, and Costerus Ies. Enchirid.
If the Saints departed do pray for revenge against their enemies, it is likely
they do pray for blessedness for their friends and brethren. The consequence
is good, but the Antecedent is naught, because those Saints there mentioned, do
not properly pray for revenge: which their Jesuit Ribera did right well
understand; Quaeritur quomodo mortui vindictam petant de interfectoribus suis,
quos viui vt proximos suos amabant. Absit autem vt sancti sint in vita
feliciore crudeles. Quaestio facile soluitur, si dicimus cor^ora Sanctorum
conspersa cruore vltionem de interf^ctoribus petere, sicut Genesis 4. Sanguis Abel
dicitur clamare ad Deum contra Cain interfectorem. Ribera Ies. com. in Apoc. 6.
The question is, (says he) how these souls under the Altar did pray for
revenge upon their enemies after their death, who in their life time did pray
to God to forgive them; God forbid (says he) we should think that the Saints
are made more cruel by their blessedness: but the question is easily
assoiled, that the bodies of the Saints embrued with blood did cry for
vengeance, even as the blood of Abelis said, Genesis 4. to have cried for
vengeance against Cain. And lest any scruple might arise from the word souls,
which are said to cry, their Jesuit Viega does prevent it, saying, that it is
the use of Scripture by Nec te mo^eat quod animae dicuntur, quia animae pro
hom^^ibus ipsis sumuntur, vt saepe alias. Viega Ies. in cum locum.
souls to signify men. Now the cry of Abels blood (as their Jesuit Pererius
notes from S. Augustine) Clamor Abel clamor non vocis erat, sed rationis.
Perer. Ies. Com. in Genesis 4. Per illud [Subtus Altare] quidam intelligunt
Christum, ita, vt esse sub Altari, sit esse sub testificatione nominis
Christiani. Vasquez Ies. tom. 1. in 1. 2. Thom. disp. 19. q. 4. cap. 3.
was not a cry of voice, but of reason: God discerning things not by sense,
but by equity and justice: A Vox quae non per aures auditur, sed quae
occidentium conscientiam perstringit. Chrysostom T^m. 3. Sermon. de Inuentio and
Maximo.
voice (says S. Chrysostom) which does not speak in the ear, but which
pierces the conscience and heart of murderers. And this fallacy is an
obtruding of a literal sense in stead of a metaphorical.

20 Their last place is out of Apoc. 5. 8. according unto the Rhemish
translation, thus: [The four and twenty Seniors fell before the Lamb, having
every one harpes, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of the
Saints.] Hereby it is plain (say the same translators) that the Saints in
heaven offer up the prayers of the faithful, as incense: and so the
Protestants may have no excuse of their error, that the Saints have no
knowledge of our affairs, or desires; which is also the argument of their
Bellarment to p^^ue Sanctos orare pro nobis, urges the same saying, Quem locum
exponentes Primasius, Richard is, Scholia Graeca apud Oecumen. and Gagnaeus,
dicunt orationes illas esse intercessiones pro stabilitate infirmorum. Bellar.

no, nothing makes for this, but that the four and twenty are said to be in

praedicatione denunciant. [Phiala^] id est, corda Sanctorum.
four and twenty Seniors, shall understand the Preachers and Doctors of the
Church militant; by Harps the mortification of the flesh; by Vials the hearts
of Saints; by odours the prayers of the Saints; but such Saints as are beaten
and bruised by affliction, thereby (as by spices braied) their prayers, as
incense, are made more fervent and odoriferous: which their Jesuit Viega
holds to be the true and proper exposition of this place, confirming it (as
he says) by the testimonies of S. Gregory, Bid, Primasius, Rupertus, and the
common interpretation: then have our Adversaries proved themselves no good
markemen.

21 So again they do in another text Apoc. 8. 3. where it is written,
according to the translation of the Rhemists: According to the Rhemish
Translation.
And another Angel came and stood before the Altar, having a golden censar,
and there were given unto him many incenses, that he should give of the prayers
of Saints ascended of the Angel before God, etc. Whence those Annotators
(supposing that by If this be Sa^nt Michael, or any Angel, and not Christ, as
some take it, which offers up prayers, -- hereby we conclude against
Protestants', that it derogateth not from Christ, that Angels do offer our
prayers unto God. Rhemists annot. in Ap^^alyp. 8. 3.
Angel is not meant Christ, but Michael, or some other Angel,) do intimate,
that there is the same function of Angels in praying for the Saints upon earth:
but this we may omit, because this interpretation is by them but doubtfully
objected, and Bellar. lib. 1. de beat. Sanct. c. 18. omitteth this place.
neglected by their Cardinal, and in a manner contiadicted by their Jesuit
Viega; who from a common consent expounds the place, to signify, that
Interpretes reliqui omnes per Angelum intelligunt Christum. -- Data sunt
Incensa Christo, hoc est, omnium electorum orationes, quoniam orationes

Ibid. comment. in cap. 5. Apo^al.
the prayers of all the elect are delivered unto our high Priest and Mediator
Christ Jesus, when they end their prayers with this clause, [through Jesus
Christ our Lord.] After the discussing of particular places, perverted by our
Adversaries unto ext^auagant senses, we add

A confirmation of our former proofs by more general confessions of our
learned Adversaries, showing that the Article of the Invocation of souls
departed, is not expressed in the old and new Testament: and our argument
arising thereupon.
SECT. 6.
22 With great diligence have the Romanists searched the Scriptures for defense
of their Invocation, and with no less presumption have they said, Bellarmine*
and others in the former Sections.
We have proved it out of both Testaments; seeing that al their particular
insta^ces have bin confuted by their own Doctors: amongst whom some
furthermore say more largely, that See the Jesuit Salmeron, and others above.
in the old Testament the Patriarchs used not to be inuocated, both because
they were not in perfect state of blessedness, and also because there had been
then a danger of Idolatry to offer that honor unto them. And for the new
Testament, we have two witnesses, Ecchius, and their Jesuit Salmero^, whose
authority may seem to command their assent: they say that Non est expressum
in nouo Testament^ in Scripturis (sed in Traditione) quia in primitiua Ecclesia
durum esset ^d Iudaeis praecipere* and occafio d^^etur Gentibus putandi sibi
exhibito^ esse mul tos deos pro multitudine deorum, quosreliquerant. Dubium
tamen non est, quin Ecclesi^^ Apostoli eam tradi^erint. Salmeron Ies. com. in
1. Tim. 2. disp. 7.. Postremo. Explicit non est precepta Sanctor^ defunctorum
inuocatio in sacris literis, etc. Ecchius Enchirid.
it was not expressed in the new Testament, because in the primitive Church the
Jews would have thought it an hard matter to be commanded to invoke Saints
departed, and the Gentiles would have taken an occasion to have thought that
the worship of new Gods had been prescribed unto them: These reasons do equally
confute their second hold, when they say, that it was a For if that Tradition
were then (...), the danger of scandal would have been the same: if it were
conce^led in the pri^^ltiue Church during the more general conversion of the
Jews and Gentiles, then was it not in use of a long time, and our comfort ^^
this that our practice is agreeable unto the form of the primitive Church.
tradition: for so also might they have been, bewitched with idolatrous fancies.

23 In brief, these observations of our Adversaries proofs of Invocation from
Scriptures (which are found no less vainly then vehemently objected against
us) do greatly persuade us that they in thus contending, have wrangled with
their own consciences against the light of truth.

24 The conclusion which we gather from our Adversaries, confessing that in the
Jewish Church the people of God did not use to invoke Abraham and the
Patriarths, is, that therefore the doctrine of the like invocation of Saints
departed is not justifiable among Christians: which consequent is fortified by
the judgment of S. Esaias Propheta dixit. [Tues Pater noster, qu^s Abraham
nesci^^t nos, Israel non ^ognourt n^s:] Si tanti Patriarchae, quid orga populum
a se procreatum ageretur ignorauerint, quomodo mortui viuo^um rebus atque
actionibus cognoseen. dis, ad^^uandisque miscenturi A^g^st. lib. de (...). cap.
13. Tom. 4.
Augustine, who applies the speech of Gods people in Esaias, saying unto God,
[thou art our Father, for Abraham knows us not, (...)

^^^shipped God the Creator of all things: but were not accepted, because
albeit they believed thereby to worship but one God, who was indeed in those
things which they worshipped, yet was he not in them after that manner as they
conceived. As yet there is not found among them an universal consent in this
faith.

30 Again, their Cardinal Bellarmine does report of Pope Adrian, that he
Adrianus Papa de^ep^^^ a Synodo (...), iudica^^t praedecessorem ^usi Honorium
(...) haereticum. Bellarm. lib. 4. de Po^^, cap. 11.. Ad qua^tam.
being deceived by a Synod, did condemn his predecessor Pope Honorius for an
heretic. If this be true, then are our Adversaries easily catched in their
own snare: for how must they not necessarily confess, that the Pope may err
in canonizing an unjust man, as they have willingly acknowledged, that he has
erred in condemning the just? seeing that an equal Esa. ^. 20.
woe is pronounced by God against them that call evil good, as to them that
call good evil. And thus are they become void of all pretense of any ground of
faith, in this part of worship.

31 Furthermore, (not to insist upon these particular Saints, to wit, Gregory,
Christopher, and Katherine, etc.) we need but to point at their own Authors,
such as were Prota^^ Bona ^enturam, qui (...) Parisi ensis impieta^^^ vocantis
in dubium gesta and ex^mpla sanctorum. Cath^rinus annot. in Caiet. page 129.
Gulielmus Parisiensis, Multi sunt, quorum sententiae haereticae habentur, ipsi
tamen censentur in ca^one Sanctorum. Agrippa de Vanit. scient.
Agrippa, Erasmus Catherinae Se^^nfis canoni^ationem impi^ (...). Catha^. qu^

vitam improbarat: s^ valde dubitaro dixit, vtrum vera essent, quae ab antiqui^

Bessarius, calling in question the lives of some of their Saints; of which
number some were canonized in their persons, whose opinions were condemned as
heretical: and some, whose lives he himself being an eie-witnesse, said he
did dislike. Which shows that their Romish catalogue of Saints is not worthy
of faith.

32 Lastly, this their Oracle of their faith, to wit, the Popes judgment, may
seem to lose some credit for want of antiquity, because Primus Po^tifex qui
legitur Sanctos canonizasse fuit, ni fallor, Leo ^ertius. Bellar. lib. 1. de
beat. Sanct. cap. 8. Sanctus Leo anno octingentefimo tertio Vuerdam nauigauit,

Moral. part. 2. lib. 5. cap. 6.
the first Pope that Cardinal Bellarmine can find for a president in this act
of canonizing Saints, was Leo the third, who governed that See not till about

seven hundred and nintie years after Christ: so very a nouice, in respect,
is the father of their faith. Thus we have heard some of the Romish Doctors
from reason and experience, by their own confessions, yielding us this
Antecedent, viz. their act of canonizing Saints, whom they do invoke, to be
deceivable: which being supposed, the other Romanists have approved this
consequence, viz. that then the greatest part of Romish worship ought to be
abolished. We proceed to show a greater uncertainty of their faith in this
point, viz.

The uncertainty of our Roman Adversaries in the question of what souls are
to be inuocated: and the inualiditie of their objection taken from the Article
of the communion of Saints.
SECT. 8.
33 The principal and most popular argument, whereby our Adversaries do
possess the minds of the vniudicious, is (as we find in their Jesuit
Posseuine) to persuade them, that Protestants by denying the doctrine of
Invocation, do destroy the V^s, (appell^^ Lutheranos) quib^^ articulus Symboli
de communione Sanctorum non (...) duiti non est (...)* Sanctorum, a quibus
auertistis and fidem. Pos. (...) in refut. (...) Chitrai.
Article of the communion of Saints: which Article their own Vt and vo^ 1.
Ioh. 1. -- haec societas in communione Sanctorum sita est. And a little after,
Omnium Sacramentorum fructus ad vniuersos fideles pe^tinet -- communio
charitati^, vnde Christus formam orationis praescripsit, panem nostrum, non
mesi: co^munio membrorum, seu sym pathiae, sieve dolendi and gaudendi: --
communio donorsi, spiritualium: alij Apostoli, alij Doctores, -- and
temporalium subueniendo egentibus. Cateclusm. Romanus, ex decreto Council. Trid.
and Pij Quinti Ponti^icis iussu editus, in hunc Articulum,
Roman Catechism (published by the decree of the Council of Trent, and the
command of Pius Quintus then Pope) does only expound, to signify the
communion which the militant and visible Church has by the spirit of charity
in Sacraments, and visible functions, through a sympathy of the members
thereof. As for the other communion of the Church specified by S. John, * that
you (says he) may have fellowship with us, and that our fellowship may be with
the Father and the Son: it signifies the union of one faith, by one Spirit,
in one head Christ, to one hope of a complete and everlasting blessedness,
wherein all the faithful have been always linked together, and shall be unto
the end of the world.

34 But the obiectors make three combinations of souls, wherein they pretend a
spiritual communion: first is of the souls in Purgatory with the living upon
earth: and of those souls their Cardinal avouches, that Non est incredibile
animas in Purgatorio pro nobis orare, atque impetrare Bellar. lib. 2* de
Purgas. cap. 15.. Quod autem.
it is not incredible, but that they in Purgatory pray for us: yet (as they
confess) the judgment of Thomas contrarium in 2. 2. q. 83. art. 3. Bellar.
ibid. Et Alexander part. 4. q 26. memb. 3. Azor. Ies. Instit. Moral. part. 1.
lib. 9. cap. 10.
Aquinas, and the Communis sententia est, eos minime orare pro nobis. Azor.
ibid.. Sanctus Thomas.
common opinion of the School does hold the contrary; albeit they conceive of
souls in Purgatory as of spirits, Animae in Purgatorio, etiamsi inferiores
sint nobis, ratione poenarum, tamen superiores sunt ratione gratiae and
charitatis, in quam ^am confirmatae sunt. Bellar. lib. 2. de Purg. cap. 15..
Praeterea.
more gracious in the sight of God, and more abounding in charity then are the
souls of the living. Wherefore their Church praying for them, and Ra^^o ^orum
est, quia non cons^euit Ecclesia eos orare. Azor. quo supra.
not using to pray unto them, may seem in her religion not to stand so much
upon their belief of the communion of Saints, or evidence of truth, as upon
presumption. But if we suppose that those souls do pray for us, yet this
ingendereth another doubt, viz. whether we must therefore pray unto them. Here
again we find our Adversaries as planets in variable oppositions; Contra alij
opinantur, posse no^ ad eos precas ditigere, quia Dei gratia and charitate sunt
praed^ti: and vel Angelorum ministerio, vel Dei munere possunt preces nostras
cognoscere. Azor. Ies. Instit. Moral. lib. 1. cap. 10.
Some think (says their Jesuit Azorius) that we may pray unto them, because
they are endued with charity, and either by the ministry of Angels, or by
the help of God may understand our prayers: nevertheless their Cardinal
Bellarmine, contrarily supposing that they pray for us, Q^anquam it a sit,
tamen superfluum videtur, ab ijs petere vt pro nobis orent, quia non possunt
ordinary cog^o^ce^e quid agamus in particulari, sed solum in genere sciunt nos
in multis (...). Bellar* lib. 2. de Purg. c. 15.. Praetere^ animae.
yet were it a thing superfluous for us (says he) to invoke them, because
ordinarily they cannot understand our prayers, nor know our particular wants.

55 Now what the judgment of Protestants is in the case of Invocation, our
Adversaries will report: Dicunt Protestants, Sanctos orare pro nobis, sed
tantum in genere. Bellar. lib. 1. de beat. Sanct. cap. 15. and in seqq.
Protestants do grant (says their Cardinal) that the Saints in heaven do pray
for the Church militant in general: yet Argumentum tertium (of the
Protestants) Sancti iam defuncti non cog^oscunt viuentium prece^: ergo frustra
inuocantur. --
because the Saints do not know the prayers of the living, therefore are they
not to be inuocated upon. And is not this consequence of Protestants
justifiable? Respondeo, huius argumenti nec bonam esse consequentiam, nec verum
esse quod assomitu^: Itaque primum. conseq^^tio negari potest. -- Certe non
frustr^ inuocan^^r Sancti, (...) demus ^os non (...), neque cognoscere pr^ce^
nostras. Bellarm. lib. 1. de beat. Sanct. cap. 20.. Respondeo, huius.
I answer (says the same Cardinal) the consequence is not good: which
notwithstanding himself has already made good, where he said, that See above.
it were a superfluous thing to pray unto the souls in Purgatory, because they
do not ordinarily know what we do in particular.

36 They make a second combination of souls between them in Purgatory and
the Saints in heaven: and are among themselves divided, some Circa or a^iones
Beatorum pro animab^s in Purgat^rio, non defuerunt (...) Caeholic^, qui
nagarune or are ^eatos pro animabus Purgatorij. -- Nihilo^^in^s certum
exis^ino, Sanctos beatos pro eis o^ are. Suarez les. Tom. 4. disp. 48 Sect. 5.
nu 6.
think that the blessed Saints did pray for the souls in Purgatory, and some
think not. Whereby we note (to omit a prayer in the Church, which in the
outward tenor Animaduer^^ Ecclesia in istis or ationibus pro defunctis or a^e
vt liberentur non tan^um a poenis Purgatorij, sed a Gehenna, and poena aeterna
inserni. -- Verior sensus est, ita pro ijs orar^, vt tamen repra^^e ^^ct d^^
exitus little, id est, vt ante mortem ita praeucuiantur, vt per viam sa^^^s
incedant. Suarez ibid. number. 12.
entreats for deliverance of souls out of hell, and pains eternal) how
easy it is for men to be wise above their reach in the search of things which
are unsearchable.

37 The third respect is between the souls of the living, and the spirits of
young infants dying shortly after Baptism, who do (in their opinion)
immediately and infallibly ascend unto heavenly mansions. From which
consideration there arises this question, Quaeritu^ an singulos etiam
paruulos, qui baptis^ate ^b luti ad c^^lestei^ stat^^ p^t^iam c^^uolarunt, iure
possimus orare. Respondeo, Ecclesiam non quidem singulorum iustorum and
beatorum animas deprecari, priuatim tamen quisque potest eas singular animas or
are, quas pie credit in coelum esse receptas. Az^r. Ies. Instit. Moral. part.
1. lib. 9. cap. 10.. Decimo tertio. The word Singul^rum, does not signify all,
but any particular one; for the s^^e question is there made concerning singulos
Angelos, and he gra^teth that some particular Angels are prayed unto, but
denies that the case is alike of Infants.
whether any such Iufants may in public be particularly prayed unto. The
Church (says their Azotius) uses it not, that is, uses no such prayer unto
any such particular Infant. But why? is there any childhood in glorified
Saints? is there ignorance in blessedness, or difference of age in eternity?
Let them now, if it please them, satisfy us, or rather themselves, why they
refuse the public and particular Invocation of such blessed Infants, Non enim
negamus quin Infantes rece^s baptizati saluentur, si statim ex hac vita
discedant. -- Censentur totam legem implere. Bellarm. lib. 4. de Iustif. cap. 7.
who, in the judgment of their own Church, are infallibly in the state of
glory; and yet exercise a function of canonizing men, whom they make to be
their public Advocates, wherein (as has been confessed) they both may, and
have been deceived: which argues that their Church is not directed with the
spirit of an infallible truth. And yet we wish that this were their greatest
error: for we proceed to demonstrate

Manifold Idolatry in the practice of Invocation in the Romish Church, which
is another degeneration from antiquity. This is proved both by the
conseguences and confessions of our learned Adversaries: and first by laying
down the description of Idolatry.
SECT. 9.
38 Although our Adversaries might be permitted to profess the doctrine of
Invocation, yet their manner of inuocating may be such as the changing of Act.
14. 12.
Barnabas into Jupiter, and Paul into Mercury, and so, by a kind of translated
Idolatry, dishonor God in honoring of his Saints: which we examine by their
own rules. And first Idolatry is described by their Jesuit Valentian, to be

Gregor. Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de Idol.
whenever a man intends to apploe unto any creature, either by words, or by
actions, any estimation which is proper unto the majesty of God, whether is be
done directly, ^^ indirectly.

39 Such was the case of the ancient heretics Colliridians, who although they
believed not the Virgin Mary to be God, yet (as Cardinal Bellarmine
confesses) they Cum non secus ac Deus inuocatur: ita olim quida^ Mariam, quos
Epiphanius refellit. Hares. 79.
inuocated her with an honor due unto God; and were anciently confuted by
Epiphanius. Which manner of indirect honor, we think will appear to be as
rife in the Romish worshippers, as were the Matthew. 13.
Tares sown by the envious one in the time that the husbandmen were asleep.
And for proof hereof we may be contented (although it be but one) with

An example of the sacrilegious and idolatrous worship practiced by the
Romanists, in Invocation and adoration of the blessed Virgin: by evidences
both from their words, and actions.
SECT. 10.
40 We contend not against the honor of pre-eminence ascribed unto that
glorious person, before all other vessels of blessedness. We let our
Adversaries call her, as they do, Praecipua est Sanctorum. Bellar. lib. 1. de
beat. Sanct. cap. 15.
the worthiest of the Saints, the Bellar. See at the letter, d.
Queen of heaven; and if they will, also (as generally praying for us through
the mediation of Christ, but not to be inuocated) our Advocate: for such like
encomiasticall praises their Martinus Lutherus comme^. super Magnificat.
Persona est superior cunctis, cui nemo sit par, etc. Oecolampadius de laudando
in Maria Deo: Templum est sanctiss. -- Regina est omnis^ super omnes, -- quis

Protestants to the same purpose.
Coccius does acknowledge to be used of diverse Protestants, and others. But
our dispute is about the excess of worship not much differing from the
forenamed heresy of the Collyridians.

41 We know that their Incidi in hominem de schola Caluini, qui mihi alioqui

Cardinal does contest in behalf of all Romanists, saying, Who ever honored
the Queen of heaven, the Virgin Mary, with any worship whereby she is equalled

make this a pretense of dividing themselves from the Romish Church. But the
truth hereof we permit unto any of sincere judgment, to try this by their own
words and actions, who make the Iniquitatem, quae separauit inter nos and Deum,

Marianites. Yet behold

Agreater appearance of public Idolatry in the Romish Church; by more pregnant
demonstrations.
SECT. 11.
42 Well have their learned Jesuits observed, that there are some kind of
external acts of worship, Officium aliquod est suap^e natura ita prae^larum,
vt qui^i^, rationo ipsa naturali docente iudicet solum Deum tali officio
dignum, quale est sacrificium and votum. Valent. Ies. lib. 2. de Idolol. cap.

which are known by natural reason to be properly belonging unto God: whereof
they name those two, sacrifice, and vows. But they cannot deny but that that
is used of other Romanists, which is observed to be professed in the Order of
the Friars predicant, In professione fratrum praedicatorum sic vouetur: Voueo
Deo and B. Mariae, and omnibus Sanctis, me praefato tali, vel tali, obediturum.
Cai^tan. in Thom. 2. 2. q. 88.
who in their first admission vow unto God, and the Virgin Mary, to be obedient
unto their Principal, Now then, these two homages of vows and sacrifice being
acknowledged to be so peculiarly belonging unto God, let our Adversaries
consult, (seeing the Sea confessed above.
Collyridians have been condemned for Idolatry, in sacrificing unto the virgin
Mary) how their Votarists can be excused for offering their vows unto her. But
this is not all.

43 They prefer S. Francis before Christ, (we urge nothing which is not
publicly Franciscu^ Deo vnitissimus, ideo praefuit omni creaturae. fol. 4.

authorized in their Church) making Christ by his prayers to be but an Orator
only to pray, but S. Francis an exorator, to prevail and obtain. And yet the
book which is fraught with such stubble as this, is graced among them with the
title of a Golden book. And their Church, as in a novel conceit she says the
In Censura Coloniensi dicitur, Orationem Dominicam fundimus Sanctis, vt sancte

Lords prayer unto Saints, so does she chaunt it in her Rituals, saying unto
the Virgin Mary (as is In nonnullis Ecclesijs canitur, Iube filio, o foelix

Antiphonie is taken ex Ritualibus, as Duraeus the Jesuit testifies aduers.
Whitach. fol. 352.
confessed,) O happy thou, command our Redeemer, by thy Mothers right: and
elsewhere in other hymns, making the blessed Virgin the only refuge, saying
of her, that Ignoro ad quem confugiam (speaking exclusiuely) nisi ad te Dominam
meam dulcissimam Virginem Mariam. Antidot. animae, Orat. S. Maria. And again:
Adsis, o Maria, ne desperatione succumbam mortis agone, tunc cum (excluding all
others) nulla spes est altera, nisi tu, Virgo Puerpera, Patris parens and
filia, cui me reconcilio. Ibid. Orat. O clementissima. Pope Innocentius did
promise many Indulgences unto them, who with devotion should use this last
prayer.
there is no other hope. Which prayer was magnified by Pope Quicunque

trecentos dies Indulgentiarum habebit ab Innocentio Papa, qui eam instituit.
Test nostro Lubberto, Replicat. ad Gretzer. lib. 4. cap. 1.
Innocentius, promising Indulgences to all that shouldvse it. Can regenerate
Christians but moan to hear such songs? How is not that Church by such means
to be thought adurlteous, and they to be accounted her pandors, who shall
plead for her excuse?

44 It is true, that the honor of the Mother redoundeth unto the Son, but
then only when the honor is just: for in that 1. Reg. 2. 19. 20.
King Solomon sitting on his throne, caused a seat to be set for the kings
mother, and she said, I desire a small request of thee, etc. it shows, that a
King would be desired of his Mother, not commanded: for it was sufficient
honor for her to sit near his person of majesty. So likewise this vessel of
grace, in her hymn professed, that it was her honor to magnify her Lord
Christ, and that her happiness was to rejoice in the same her Savior: so that
the Romanists may be justly thought in their worship, much to dishonor that
blessed Virgin by too much honoring her. The Matthew. 2.
wise men of the East, who were directed by a star where to find Christ, when
they had found him, did, without her intercession to their Intercessor,
directly present their homage unto Christ. Let their wisdom, or rather the
wisdom of the holy Ghost in relating that story, be our star to direct us
in our worship. We add in the last place

A confessed practice of Idolatry by their Romish people, in their Invocation
of Saints: from the complaints of our more ingenuous Adversaries.
SECT. 12.
45 We know that this accusation of an adversary, in vpbraiding their church
with the Idolatry committed by her people, would be suspected to be but an
exasperatio^ of malice: therefore do we desire her attentio^, not unto the
criminatio^s of Protestants but unto the confessio^s and complaints of her own
Doctors; some of the^ wishing a Quinetiam public ab ijs, quorum ad officium

the honor due unto the Son might be empaired: exclaiming against the popular

reposing more confidence in Saints, then in God: and lastly exhibiting (as may
be The books of Accounts belonging to Christ-church in Canterbury (as is
reported) do testify that there being three several offerings, to Christ, to

seen) greater pledges of devotion unto a supposed Saint, then to our Lord
Christ. When we have all these so plain and public notifications of so many
sacrilegious superstitions, which are partly caused, partly occasioned by their
Church, can we either acknowledge in her a true mother-hood, or she a just
father hood in true antiquity? What now remains, but only

A conclusion, manifesting whether the profession of Protestants or Romanists
is the more fafe for our souls repose.
SECT. 13.
46 In as much as we are taught to except against a doctrine of worship, which
for antiquity is not from the first Matthew. 19. From the beginning it was not
so.

affection; which carried the Colly^idian weaklings headlong into a condemned
adoration of the blessed Virgin: our Reader may judge whether this doctrine
can be esteemed to b^ truly Catholic.

47 Then, seeing some of our Adversaries have professedly suggesteda
confirmation of this doctrine out of Scriptures of the old and new Testament,
both by general assertions, and particular instances, and have been. 3. 4. 5.
6.
confuted from point to point by the testimonies of their own Doctors: our
Reader is occasioned to suspect both the credit of the obiectors, who have
violently forced the Scriptures beyond compass, and also the truth of the
article, which is proved to have no direct evidence in Scripture.

48 Next, knowing the greatest part of Romish Invocation depends upon the
authority of the. 7.
Pope of Rome in canonizing Saints, a jurisdiction both new, and. 7.
deceivable: whereupon follows a necessary. 7.
abolishing of the greatest part of the Romish worship: our reader may
determine whether they may be thought to be safe directors of our faith, who
are thus vnsatisfiable in their own. Furthermore, considering that our
Adversaries in enquiring what parties are to be inuocated, are (as it were) at
a crosse-way, saying and gainsaying, that they in. 8.
Purgatory pray for us, and we to them, etc. and teaching an invocation of
Saints canonized, which may be subject unto error; and yet forbidding all
invocation of particular Infants, who (in their judgment) are infallibly
saincted: our Reader may weigh, whether this incongtuitie issue not merely
from presumption.

49 Lastly, understanding that the diverse. 10.
speeches of their greatest Doctors, as Jesuits; and authorized. 11.
prayers in their Church, do flatly vent out Idolatrous forms of praying, and
that also many of their. 12.
people are confessed to be deeply plunged in this same crime of crimes, by
their manner of inuocating Saints: our Reader will easily conceive, whether
there can be any safe communion with them, who have so deformedly degenerated
from the integrity of the worship of God; or whether it be not more safe to
embrace such an Advocate, who (according to the proper signification of this
word among Lawyers) can in justice plead the cause inter Deum and reum; even
that one whom the finger of God has pointed out, saying, 1. Ioh. 2. 1.
If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ: and so to
resolve with an holy jealousy, for the honor of God, and of his Christ, to
continue in the simplicity of that worship, which best accords with the
Oracles of God in sacred writ: the rather because, as their Jesuit confesses,
that that Cultus noxius semper saepe laethalis, quando cui debetur cultus, non
quo debetur modo exhibetur. Delrio Ies. lib. 1. de Magia. cap. 1. page 2.
service is always hurtful, and sometimes pernicious, wherein we do not
perform dutiful worship after that manner which we owe unto God.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
8 Eighthly, concerning Baptism, that the most ancient Fathers (who succeeded
next to the Apostles Scholars) namely Iustine, Clement, etc. Centur. 2. c. 4
col. 47. line 43. and in Centur. 3. c. 4. col. 82. line 55. it is said,

baptizatum intus sanctificet.
thought regeneration (not to be signified but) wrought by Baptism, and the
word; unto which (two) joined together they attribute efficacy, that is to
say, remission of sins: that also Cent. 3. ca. 6. col. 125. line 16.

accustomed to be signed with the sign of the Cross. That there were likewise

almost from the ve^ie beginning of the Church, to use the Baptism of lay
persons in danger of death.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Setting down the state of the question.
SECT. 1.
THere be three points concerning Baptism, which by these Apologists we are
urged to discuss: First, the efficacy; secondly, the necessity: thirdly, the
rites and ceremonies belonging thereunto. Our answer to the first is,

That the Apologists have bewraied much ignorance, by obiecting against
Protestants the efficacy of Baptism: by the confession of our Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 The efficacy of Baptism, which is, as the Apologists have noted, Apolog.
number. 2.
the working remission of sin, is now by them objected against Protestants,
as adversaries thereunto. Wherein appears their double ignorance, first in
not understanding the general doctrine of Protestants, which notwithstanding
our greatest Adversary has thus acknowledged: Lutherus art. 2. ait, omnia
peccata in Baptismo remitti. Caluinus, omnium peccatoru^ reatus per Baptismum
deleri, Philippus Melancthon, Peccatum in baptismo remitti, vt non imputetur.
Bellarm lib. 1. de Baptis. cap. 13. Kemnitius fatetur remitti in Baptismo omnia
peccata, quinetiam tolli ac deleri, and solum reliquias quasdam originalis
peccati restare. Bellar. ibid. Neither do they affirm a bare remission only,
but such a one as does always imply regeneration also, and an inchoatiue
extinction of original concupiscence and sin. Therefore Luther [In Tit 3.
Baptismus est lauacrum regenerations] Non quo externus homo abluitur tantum,
sed quo tota natura mutetur in aliam naturam, id est, quo prior natiuitas
carnalis destruitur cum tota peccatorum and perditionis natiuitate. Luther
homil. in Tit. 3. If peradventure some particular one should hold otherwise,
yet should they not by thus obiecting make it the Tenet of Protestants.
Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, and Kemnitius say (says he,) that both remission
of sin is given, and regeneration wrought in Baptism. Secondly, they have
much injured the Centurists, whom they produce as censurers of the Fathers in
this point of efficacy of Baptism, (which consists in the remission of
sin;) but do utterly mistake, in the For the Centurists, Cent. 2. c. 4 col.
47. line 43. note the efficacy of Baptism not for an error, but for a truth
taught by the Fathers. Sentiunt regenerationem fieri per baptismum and verbum,
quibus coniunctis efficaciam tribuunt remissionem peccatoru^, and quidem in
adultis poenitentiam requirunt. No more blaming the Fathers for affirming the
efficacy of baptism remission and regeneration, then for requiring repentance
in every adultus baptized.
first place, error for truth, and in the In the second place, Cent. 3. c. 4.
col. 82. line 55. the Apologists are as much deceived: for the error there
noted, is not of many Fathers, but of only Cyprian; and not for the efficacy
of baptism, but of the person baptizing Aff^^mare audet quod persona baptizans
Spiritum sanctum conserat. And of the additaments of baptism, de efficacia and
necessitate Vnctionis, which every Romanist will grant to be a point erroneous:
for only the word and water are of the necessity of this Sacrament.
second, Baptism in stead of the baptizer.

Concerning the necessity of the Bapisme of Infants, our first inquiry must
be, whether the Romanists will permit such kind of exceptions against the
doctrine of some ancients in a question of like nature: by the confession of
our Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
3 We shall need no other president for our direction then the examples of our
Adversaries, who would press us with a yoke of necessary subscription unto
all the opinions which have been general in any age before us; which
notwithstanding they themselves do easily and liberally reject. For first, the
Augustini and Innocentij primi sententia fuit, quae sexcentos fere annos viguit
in Ecclesia, Eucharistiam etian. Infantibus neceslariam esse: quae tandem ab
Ecclesia reiecta est. Neque Protestants a nobis in hac re dissentiunt.
Maldonatus Iesuita comment. in Johan. 6. 53.
necessity of ministering the Eucharist unto Infants (as a learned Jesuit
confesses) was defended by Augustine and Pope Innocentius, and was practiced
in the Church for almost 600 years together: notwithstanding it is now (upon
better judgment) contradicted, and altered in the same Church.

4 Secondly, they acknowledge, that Aliquando aliquorum Patrum opinio fuit, cum
omnium Scholasticorum sententia pugnans, vbi docuerunt Patres, Infantes absque
baptismo morientes igne perpetuo crucia^i. Nostra verior, eos poe^a sensus non
puniri. Azorius Ies. Instit. Moral. lib. 2. cap. 17. part. 1. Nonnulli
Catholici sentiunt, par^^los infantes non baptizatos propter originale peccatum
puniri, non modo poena damni, quae est sola gratiae priuatio, sed etiam poena
aliqua sensus ex igne proueniente, mitiori quam adultos: August. ser. 14. de
verb. Apost. vbi dicit infantes illos deputandos esse ad sinistram in ignem
aeternum. Et lib. 5. cont. lulian. cap. 8. docet hanc poenam ignis seruatam
esse infantibus, quanta tamen sit futura, definire non audet. Idem plane
affirmat Fulgent. libro Hypognost. and lib. de Incarnat. cap. 30. Tametsi
negare non possumus praedictam opinionem fuisse Augustini and Fulgentij, a qua
non multum Gregorius magnus abhorret, tamen meo iudicio non solum probabilior,
verumetiam communis Scholae sententia, ^os nulla alia poena^ quam damni, id
est, pri^atione beatitudinis puniri Vasques Ies. in Thom. disp. 134. cap. 2.
and. 3.
S. Augustine, Fulgentius, Gregory, and other Fathers did teach, that Infants
dying without Baptism did presently descend into the place of the damned, to
be sensibly tormented in hellfire. Nevertheless, now (say they) the general
profession of our Church is against it. How then shall we presume of sincerity
in our Apologists, who in the doctrine of the necessity of Sacraments, do so
closely pursue us with that authority, which they themselves do, in these two
points, freely, and (as we willingly confess) also justly refuse?
Notwithstanding seeing their argument so urges the absolute necessity of
Baptism of Infants, as without which they cannot possibly be saved, we descend
unto a second trial, to know.

Whether the question of the absolute necessity of Baptism be justifiable by
the practice of primitive antiquity: from the testimonies of our learned
Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
5 The custom of the more primitive Church (as they know) Quodsi de sanctis
and pijs olim hominib' legitur eos diu distulisle baptilmum, etc. hoc fuit
extraordinarium. Greg. Valent. Ies. tom. 4. disp. 4. punct. 4. which being
spoken of the Adu^tus, does agree unto Infants.
deferred their Baptism for a long season. Whether this were ordinary, or (as
some of them will have it) extraordinary, is not pertinent unto the point of
necessity. Socrates notes, that Aliam consuetudinem in Thessalia esse
cognoui, vt diebus Paschatis duntaxat baptizent: ob quam causam omnes, paucis
admodu^ exceptis, absque baptismo moriuntur. Socrates hiss. Eccles. lib. 5.
cap. 21.
in Thessaly, by reason of deferring of Baptism until Easter, it happened
that many, yea the most died before Baptism, as well Infants, as sometimes men
of descretion.

6 Now when we find, that the ancient and universal custom of the Church was
(as it appears in the decree of Pope Tom. 1. Conc. apud Surium, page 731.
Leo the first,) to appoint only two times in the year for solemn Baptismes
(although indeed the case of necessity was sometime excepted,) we require of
our Adversaries the reason of the alteration of that custom, which has been
for antiquity so long, and large for universality: and they tell us, that
Haec consuetudo iamdiu antiquata est, quia (inquit Rupertus) periculosum erat
tantam multitudinem deferri propter occasiones mortis, maxim propter tu^bam
Infantium visum est sanctae Ecclesiae passim indulgentia baptizandi concesla,
cuncta anteuenire pericula. Suarez Ies. disp. 3. de Sacram. and Binius Conc.
Tom. 1. in Decret. Papae Leonis, cap. 1. can. 6. Suarez adds, Quantum ad
obligationem praecepti spectat, nam quantum ad obseruantiam, ob antiquitatis
reuerentiam, and memoriam, adhuc Romae huius consuetudinis vestigia seruari
videmus. Suarez tom. 3. in Thom. disp. 31. and q. 71. Sect. 2. page 433. lit.
b. c.
it has been therefore changed by the Church, because of the danger, which by
so long delay did ensue, especially toward young Infants, by many occasions of
untimely deaths. This we take to be a sufficient acknowledgement, that the
primitive Doctors held no such absolute necessity of Baptism for Infants,
except we shall dare to think the primitive mother Church to have been either
so unwise as not to discern the now pretended danger, or else so unnatural
and graceless (especially in so great an hazard of salvation) as not by
speedy Baptism willingly to prevent it. In our third trial we shall manif^st,

That this doctrine of Protestants is fully established by the confessions of
their learned Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
7 By our diligent search into the writings of our Adversaries, we find diverse
among them to have been so far from the now Romish opinion, concerning the
unbaptized children of Christian p^rents, that they held it Suscipiunt nonnulli
sententiam etiam orthodoxi iuxta and doctissimi viri, qua asseritur, quodsi
eorum habenda sit ratio, ad quorum aures Euangelij denunciatio nondum
peruenerit, etc. -- posse hosce natiua solum intelligentia imbutos Dei exi

scientia assecuti fuerint, sieve aliorum relatu ita esse credant, modo Dei amore
in vita flagrauerint, and odio peccati ab eius contagione recesserint,
sempiternam foelicitatem suo tempore indipisci Hoc opinantur ^yranus in Heb.
11. Tostatus in Genesis 17. Dionys. Carthu^. in Heb. 11. -- Andraeas Vega lib. 6.
in Conc cap. 20. Viu^s lib, 18. Ciu^t. cap. 47. and alij nonnulli; quod ex hi^

Deum cognouissent, etc. -- Ratio eorum qu^d viderant infinitas myriadas

sententijs diceremus, quinetiam adultae aetatis tot homines and foeminas, etc
Vt refert Westonu^ Anglus, Trofessor Duaci, de trip^^^minis officio, lib. 3.
cap. 22.
not agreeable to the divine mercy of almighty God to condemn the unbaptized
children, even of heathenish Pagans, to the torments of hell.

8 If some of our Adversaries have thus pronounced of Infidels Agars seed,
(which engenders unto eternal bondage) for the freeing of them from hell, we
are in good hope that some others amongst them will be found so charitable, as
to lend us a voice in behalf of the of spring of Sarah (that is, the children
of the promise borne of faithful parents) for the acknowledgment of their
bliss. This they have done with a large consent, as Vt pereant quotquot, qui
sunt infiniti, qui bapti^mo carent, ho^ (inquiunt Caictanus, Gabriel, and alij
Catholici) est a Dei misericordi^ ali^num. Bellar. lib. 1. de Bapt. cap. 4..

find Tilmannus, Segebergensis, Thomas Elisius, Georgius Cassander, all
concluding that all such children of faithful parents are within the covenant
of grace, and capable of eternal life. Thus much from their confessions, we
proceed yet further unto a fourth trial

Whether the foresaid doctrine of Protestants be not justified and fortified by
the most exact proofs and consequences, used and urged by our learned
Adversaries.
SECT. 6.
9 If in a question of this nature we should only rest upon the bare
confessions of our Adversaries, without their judicious consequents, we might
seem to be directed rather by men's persons, then by their reasons: therefore
that our Reader may know, that these Doctors were, in this our defense, no
blind guides, we have singled out of our adversaries such advocates for us, as
are accounted to have been Georgius Cassander lib. de Baptismo Infantium, part
altera, Coloniae 1565. Cum priuilegio, etc. Haec testimonia ideo assumpsimus,

Doctor of Paris, and preaching this doctrine without controlle in the Council
of Constance: another being a Cardinal, for learning reputed the Master of
Masters: who all do by forcible arguments euince our conclusions, to wit, that
God both can and will mercifully respect those children, who issuing from
faithful parents, are by any necessity (which is void of all contempt)
deprived of the use of the Sacrament of Baptism: and that this doctrine is, in
many respects, the safest hold.

10 The first and general reason is taken from the mercy of God unto his
Church, which in all things exceeds in goodness not only the deserts, but
even the hopes of men: and hereof they resolve upon a constat, that is, an
Constat Deum misericordiam saluationis suae non ita legibus communibus
Traditionis Christianae, non ita Sacramentis ipsis alligasse; quin possit
pueros nondum natos extra vterum sanctificare, etc. Gerson apud Cassandrum quo

Cassandrum quo supra, fol. 128.
evidence, that God in such cases of necessity will not precisely tie his grace
unto the use of outward elements. Which is propounded as the common opinion of
their Divines, and is also confessed by Cardinal Bellarmine, saying, (although
of a matter of a different kind) that Answering that it is no error to think
that Christ by his descent into hell did free many, yea all out of Purgatory ex
gratia speciali: his reason, quia Dominus non est Sacramentis alligat^s, aut
meritis nostris. Bellar. lib. 4. de Christo, cap. vlt. yet condemns this.
God is not tied in his bond unto his Sacraments. Which may be (we think) a
comment upon that text where it is written, [ Ioh. 3. 5.
Except a man be borne again of water and etc. to expound this word, [except,]
by way of another exception, namely the case of such a necessity: which is
without all contempt of the Sacrament.

11 This is secondly proved by the ordinance of God in the old Testament,
wherein (as their own Circumcisionem valuisse ad remissionem peccati
originalis magno cons^nsu Patres tradiderunt, and Scholastici Theologi omnes.
B^llar. lib. Recognit.. De Sacramentis in genere.
Authors do observe out of the Fathers) Circumcision was the Sacrament of
remission of original sins; when notwithstanding the children dying
uncircumcised were saved (says S. Credimus etc. paruulis autem etiam solam
profuisse imo and suffeciffe parentum fidem. S. Bernardus epist 77. ad Hugonem
de sancto Victore.
Bernard) only by the faith of their parents. Therefore the people of God in
the new Testament may (as we think) conceive hope of their children: for the
faith of both Testaments being the same, we may not imagine a diverse
necessity of a Sacrament, because (as their Cardinal Caietane has truly
argued) Fides ^ola veterum non fuit maioris virtutis apud veteres, quam apud
nos: -- at tunc deficiente pa^uulis proprio salutis auxilio, parentum fides pro
illis sola sufficiebat: ergo nunc quando paruulis deest baptismi remedium. --
And to an objection, that the Sacrament of the new Testament is of greater
virtue and necessity, he answers, Duobus existentibus fide and fidei
Sacramento* operanti apud veteres fidei, adiunctum est nostro tempore fidei
sacramentum sub ratione possibilis; intelligimus, non vt virtutem fidei soluat,
sed vt adimpleat. Caietan in 3. part. Them. q. 68. art. 1. and 2 Pergit:
Confirmatur hoc a salute paruulorum, ^ui ante diem circumcisionis moriebantur,
nam tales, secundum probabiliorem opinionem, moriebantur incircumcisi, vt patet
de fratre Salomonis; and tamen saluabantur, etc. And Tilmannus Sigebergensis in
Clypeo fidei --.Quis tam stipes est, qui ignoret parentum solam fidem paruulis
succurrisse ante circumcisionem morientibus? Consequitur itaque paruulis, etc
So Elisius: Filij Haebraeorum, qui mori^bantur incircumcisi, aut saluabantur,
aut non: si saluabantur, habeo intentum, quia fides nostra est multo melior: si
sic, sequeretur quod mares essent deteriores conditionis quim foeminae, cum
ambo haberent originale pec^a^um, and mares damnantur, qui incircumcisi
moriebantur, foeminae non. These are cited by Cassander, part altera de Bap.
Infant. fol. 123. 126. 138.
a Sacrament being but an adiunct of faith, was ordained not to dissolve, but
to confirm the same faith. Well then, could a Jewish 2. Sam. 12.
Father, hearing of the death of his child before it had received the outward
character of Gods covenant by the Sacrament of circumcision, call for meat and
drink to solace himself, for the confidence sake which he had of the happy
estate of that child; and shall Christian parents by a contrary belief of the
eternal misery, necessarily enthralling their unbaptized children in the
prison of hell, sit down and take up the lamentation of Matthew. 2. 18.
Rachel, weeping and mourning for their children, because they are not?

12 Thirdly, the Romanists ground their pretended necessity of Baptism upon
the words of our Savior, saying, Ioh. 3. 5.
Except a man be borne again of water, etc. yet notwithstanding have they
conceived another Baptism, which is Perfecta conuersio ac poenitentia recte
baptismus flaminis dicitur, and baptismum aquae saltem necessitate supplet: --
sine dubio credendum est veram conuersionem supplere baptismum aquae, cum non
ex contemptu, sed ex necessitate aliqui sine baptismo aquae decedunt. Bellar
lib. 1. de Baptis. cap. 6.. Secunda propositio.
Flaminis, saying, that Catechumeni in adulta aetate ante susceptum baptisma
voto and desiderio sumendi credunt, and inter Ecclesiae membra numerantur:
saluantur quoque si nondum suscepto fluminis baptismate decesserint: quod
vsuvenisse Valentiniano Imperatori certissimu^ est, de quo Ambrosius: Audiui
(inquit) vos dolere, quod non susceperit Sacramenta baptismatis; Dicite mihi,
quid aliud in nobis est, nisi voluntas, nisi petitio? atque etiam dudum hoc
votum habuit, etc. -- Quae autem ratio est, vt baptismus flaminis magis locum
habeat in adultis quam in paru^^^ an forte Deum crudeliorem fore paruulis quam
adultis? Tilmannus apud Cassandrum, quo supra.
catechized persons, and such as be of discretion, in whom there is contrition
for sin, and purpose of being baptized, although they die before they receive
the outward Baptism of water, yet are they in the state of salvation, the
necessity of the baptism of water now wanting, being supplied by the baptism
of the Spirit. Which their Jesuit Lorinus does prove out of S. Augustine,
concluding also out of Scripture, that in such a case, In Act. 10. 44. Cecidit
Spiritus sanctus super omnes qui audiuerunt verbum.] Monet Augustinus q. 84. in
Leuit. vt hinc intelligamus quod inuisibilis sanctificatio quibusdam adfuerit
atque profuerit, possitque interdum adesse and prodesse sine visibili
Sacramento, vt Deus non alligetur (vt vulgati axiomate loquuntur) suis
Sacramentis, quando viz. Sacramentum (l. 4. de Bapt. c. 24) vt Baptistismum,
non contemptus religionis, sed necessitatis articulus excludat, vt Augustini
verbis vtar. Lorinus Ies. comm. in Act. 2. S^ also Bellarmine, Conuersio ad
Deum, licet Baptisma quoddam sit, non est tamen Sacramentum. Bellar. lib. 1. de
Baptis. cap. 6.. Quinta prop.
the invisible grace of sanctification does, without the visible Sacrament of
Baptism, profit those faithful, who by necessity, and not in contempt of
religion, are deprived of Baptism.

13 Hence their forenamed Authors assume, that the children of the faithful
dying without Baptism, may be thought to receive the Baptism of the Spirit,
as well as those Catechumenists spoken of, (among whom by the Fathers is
reckoned Lbrum Ambrosij de morte Valentiniani legate, and aduertet sine dubio
sanctum virum homini non baptizato and mortuo fidenter, and de sola fide
salute^ praesumere, and tribuere indubitanter bonae voluntati quod defuit
facultati. Bernard. epist. 77 ^^d Hug^nem: and in the same place adds out of
S. Augustine, Tunc, inquit, impletur inuisibiliter, cum mysterium baptismatis
non contemptus religionis, sed articulus necessitatis excludit, Ibid.
Valentinian the Emperor:) except we shall think (say they) that God is more
merciful unto men of years, then unto tender Infants: as to make men capable
of grace without the use of outward Baptism, and to deny children the
necessary means of salvation. But what should hinder their salvation? only
the want of Baptism by water? How then could Valentinian be saved? They say
this was, because the want of the outward baptism of water was supplied by the
inward Baptism of the sanctifying Spirit: and we know, that Luc. 1.
John the Baptist, when he was as yet unbaptized, and uncircumcised, he was
Christened by the spirit of sanctification, even in his mothers womb.

14 The Romanists have added yet a third Baptism, which they term sanguinis,
of blood: which, they say, acquitteth a man of the necessary debt of Baptism,
which is by water; Martyrium recte dicitur esse quoddam baptisma -- dans
gratiam ex opere operato. -- Probatur ex Martyrio infantum: Constat enim
infantes pro Christo occisos non solum saluari, sed etiam haberi ab Ecclesia in
numero Martyrum, etc. -- Infantes qui nihil possunt operari: -- and
probabilissimum est, and fere certum, eos non fuisse circumcisos, inter quos
non pauci erant Gentiles. Bellar. lib. 1. de Bapt. cap. 6.. Prima propositio,
etc.
so that as well the unbaptized children, as men being slain for Christ, are
truly baptized (say they) in their own blood, and thereby are not only saved,
but also numbered among the blessed Martyrs: which they think to be confirmed
by the example of the Infants slain at the birth of Christ. Whence their own
Authors are bold thus to argue against them, viz. Baptismi vicem implere
passionem probat Cyprianus ab exemplo Latronis. -- Altera Caietani ratio est,
quia status ille est capax baptismi sanguinis. Si enim propter Christum infans
in (...) occideretur, Martyr esset non minus quam innocents. -- Et hic est
scopus omnium verborum, quae habet Caietanus. Infantes in vtero sunt capaces
baptismi sanguinis, ergo flaminis. Tilmannus apud Cassandrum, part altera de
Baptismo Inf^^t. fol. 128. and 131.
If children unbaptized may be capable Baptismi sanguinis, that is, of the
Baptism of blood, then are they capable Baptismi slaminis, that is, of the
baptism of the Spirit also, even in the wombes of their mothers. Which reason
is very solid and sound, because there was never any soul interested in
Christ, but it was possessed with his sanctifying Spirit: as it is written,
Romans 8. 9.
Whosoever are Christ's have received the spirit of Christ. If these reasons be
not sufficient, we add

A confirmation of the same doctrine of Protestants, by other arguments of our
learned Adversaries.
SECT. 7.
15 Another general principle and practice of the Romish Church, is to teach,
that Paruulos non credentes actu primo baptizari in sola fide Ecclesiae.
Council. Trid. Sess. 7. Can. 14.
children wanting faith are baptized in the faith of the Church, because,
Bellarmine answering this argument of the Anabaptists: Infantes non credunt,
ergo non sunt baptizandi: says, Dico sufficere ad baptismum fidem alienam:
sicut eis obfuit peccatum alie^um. Bellarmin de Baptism. lib. 1. cap. 9..
Quintum argumentum, etc. Rursus: Duplex fides requiritur in Baptismo, Actualis
vna, quae praecedit, vt dispositio, and ca est quae exigitur a baptizatis, dum
iubentur respondere an credant, etc. altera quae sequitur Baptismu^, quae est
pars essentialis iustificationis, and non est actus sed habitus. Ibid, cap.
11.. Est autem.
as another man's sin was originally the cause of their damnation; so other
men's faith suffices them unto Baptism, for their salvation. Hence their own
Authors do learnedly thus collect, Ait Thomas 3. part. q. 68. and q. 69. A. 6.
ad 3. In multis locis pueri baptizantur in fide militantis Ecclesiae, quae si
per impossible deficeret, suppleret Ecclesia triumphans. Elisius apud
Cassandrum, quo supra, page 134. Si itaque fides and voluntas Ecclesiae

causae est cur non etiam eos obtinendae sanctificationi idoneos efficiat, si
externum baptismi signum iam voto praesumptum, necessitas, quae vitari non
potest, iam sola prohibeat? -- Nam etiam ante Baptismum susceptum, paruulos in
credentium numero aliquo modo haberi, ex priscae Ecclesiae consuetudine
apparet, qua infantes ante lotionem de fide interrogantur an credant, etc. --
quod etia^ patet ex ordine Romano, in quo feria 4. hebdom. 3. quadragesimae

nisi haec inani and mendaci caeremonia fieri dicamus, certe vel tunc infantes
non prorsus a fide alieni habendi sunt etc. -- Ergo non deest illis prorsus
fides, nec conuersio cordis, quae illis per Dei benignitatem imputatur, --
praesertim vbi voluntas (namely of the offerers) pro facto reputetur, vbi
factum excludit necessitas, vt docet Bernardus in epistola ad Hugone^ de Sancto
Victore: vbi etiamfi neget infantes hanc fidem, hoc est, cordis ad Deum
conuersionem habere, prohibente aetate, and consequenter salute priuari, si
absque baptismi perceptione moriantur: fatetur tamen in eodem loco, ipsos cum
baptizantur infantes fide omnino non carere, sine qua impossible est vel ipsis
infantibus placere Deo, sed saluari and ipsos per fidem, non suam quidem sed
alienam. Cassander ipse ibid. page 140.
Seeing that (say they) according to the ancient custom of the Church, yea and
the Roman order of Baptism, the child when it is baptized, is solemnly
asked, whether it do believe, and whether it desire to be baptized; and answer
is made by the Church in the name of the child, I believe, and, that is my
desire: it cannot be denied, but that the child (except we will confess that
this is a vain and lying ceremony, which is used in the Church) is, before it
be baptized, in some sort partaker of the Sacrament of Baptism, even by the
faith of the Church, which has vowed them hereunto. So that, in case of
necessity children are no less excusable by the vow, and the faith of the
Church, then the adulti are held to be by their own: which point they have
further cleared and confirmed by a pertinent and pregnant Quid si quis
Paterfamilias inter barbaros firmiter statuerit, die crastino familiam suam
totam, in qua etiam infantes sunt, Christo per baptismum consecrare, and ipse
cum vniuersa familia vel subita ^ue, vel aquarum dilu^io, vel ignis incendio,
vel grassatoru^ hostium ferro e vita tolleretur: nemo, credo, dubitabit adultos
omnes saluari, qui se iam fide ad Deum conuerterant, and baptismi sacramentum
voto perceperant, baptismi gratia non priuari: An infantes solos damnatos
dixerimus, qui tamen vni cum adultis Christo voto parentis addicti and
consecrati fuerunt? -- Bonauentura paruulos ad baptismum disponi ait, non
quidem secundum actum suum, sed secundum actum alienum, quia diuina
misericordia alienam voluntatem ipsis propriam reputat. Cassander ibid. fol.

supposition: but we proceed.

16 A fifth argument may be derived from strange Paradoxes (as we think) which
the presumed necessity of outward Baptism has begot, as namely to equalize
the children of faithful parents with the seed of In Ecclesia festinatur ad
baptizandos paruulos, ne filij fidelium sine baptismo decedentes, sint apud

17 If we might be suffered a little to transgress our former course, and not
wholly to stand unto the arbitrament of our Adversaries, in defense of our
cause, but use our own arguments, it would be no hard matter for us by that
Scripture; ( 1. Cor. 7. 14.

Root is sanctified and holy, (such is the prerogative of Christianity) that
the branch may be also called holy. Otherwise if the unbelieving husband should
not have suffered his child to be baptized, which was begotten of the believing
wife, and the child so dying must perish: then the privilege of believing
should not be so great, if the cleanness spoken of did not extend further then
the approbation of her marriage. There remains nothing now, but to shut up
all in

The conclusion, manifesting the doctrine of Protestants to be the more sound
and safe profession.
SECT. 8.
18 Our Adversaries defend (we know) as an Article of Hui^smodi infantes qui
sine baptismo decedunt, non salua^tur, q^od est fides Catholica. D Hungerus Col
loq. Ratis^ in. collocutor congress^ Sess. 1. and Greg. de Valen. Tom. 4.
faith, that all children dying without Baptism are not saved: but are
committed unto prison, even the brim of hell, there to endure the everlasting
punishment of loss, which is the privation of blessedness. The unsoundness
of which position is discerneable: first, because it is not a Catholic, that
is, not an universal faith, which not only some ancient Churches confuted by
their. 4.
practice, but also many late. 5.
Romanists, and singular Doctors have contradicted by their public writings.

19 Secondly, because they cannot define it be to an article of infallible
truth; the contrary whereunto their own singularly approved. 5.. 6.. 7.
Doctors have strongly maintained, as more agreeable unto the glory of Gods
grace, more comfortable to his Saints, more proportionable to his covenant in
the old Law, more warrantable by example of the Baptist, and more consonant
both unto other Baptismes, as flaminis and sanguinis, and also unto the manner
of baptizing professed and used in their own Church.

20 Thirdly, the revolt which the greatest defenders of that Article have made
from true antiquity, does manifest the^ to be neither Catholic nor faithful in
their profession: who have devised, after the general day of judgment, a
peculiar place for such Infants, which they call See above Cap. 8.. 4.
Limbus puerorum, distinct from the tormenting hell, contrary to the
universal doctrine of ancient Fathers; who according unto the tenor of the
last judgment, have acknowledged but only two stations, one on the Matthew. 25.

madmen, and by Pagans, and in scorn, and with puddle water, even unto the

concomitants of this doctrine?

21 Lastly, every child at the fist birth is, in both Churches, vowed and
destinated to be baptized in due time: but yet differently; for the Church of
Rome despaireth of the salvation of such a soul dying without baptism: the
Church of the Protestants do believe, that by the mercy of God in Christ, it
shall enjoy blessedness. Now then (supposing an indifference of truth on both
sides,) whether doctrine is more safe, may be judged by the grace of our Lord,
who promises to answer his Church according to her faith. There yet remains
something to be answered

Concerning the ceremoniallrites urged by the Apologists, to wit, Baptism used
by lay persons, threefold immersion, sign of the Cross, and unction.
SECT. 9.
22 These obiectors, and great challengers of Protestants to dispute, do, in
this place, urge the authority of ancient Fathers, to prove the ceremony of
threefold immersion, that is, the dipping of the party baptized thrice in the
lauer of baptism: thereby to convince Protestants of contempt against
venerable antiquity; when as yet themselves could not be ignorant of the
doctrine of their own Church, teaching that the same Baptizatus ter mergebatur
in aqua, in similitudinem mortis Christi, qui tres dies sepultus fuit. Aquinas
in Coloss. 2. lect. 3. Hic ritus qui ab Apostolica authoritate confirmatus, per
contrariam consuetudinem ab eo, qui Apostolica authoritate fungitur, Romano
Pontifice mutari and aboleri potest Greg. Valent. Ies Analys. page 78.

is also abrogated by the Pope of Rome, and that (as they pretend) Postulante
iusta causa, vt patet in Council. Toletano quarto. Bellar. lib. 4. de Euchar.
cap. 28.
for just cause. Wherefore we may score up this objection, with others, as
notes of the insinceritie of these Apologists, who dare thus boldly accuse
others in their own guilt: when they ought to have acknowledged the primitine
form of baptism to have been but once dipping, as more agreeable unto the
nature of baptism, which is but One faith, one baptism. Ephesians. 4. 5.
one.

23 The Baptism of laymen, proceeding from the aboue-named doctrine of the
necessity of Baptism, has in the former discourse received an answer:
whereunto may be added, that S. Augustine, who stands most for the necessity
of Baptism, does not absolutely defend such lay-ministers, but thinks that
they, by so doing, are possibly guilty (which therefore cannot be called Gods
ordinance) of some kind of Si nulla necessitas, alieni muneris est vsurpatio:
si necessitas vrgeat, aut nullum, aut veniale delictum. -- Sed etsi nulla
necessitate vsurpetur, and a quolibet cuilibet detur, quod datum est non potest
dici non datu^, quamuis recte dici possit, illicite datum. August. contra
literas Parmen. lib. 2. cap. 13.
sin. How much less would he have defended the now Romish position, which
teaches, that In tempore necessitatis Pagano vel Infideli licet baptizare.
Tolet. Ies. and Card. lib. 2. Instruct. cap. 20. and Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram.
Baptis. cap. 7.
Pagans and Infidels are lawful ministers of Baptism; seeing Augustine
thought it a Non temere aliquid inde affirmandum est sine authoritate Concilij
tanti, quantum tantae rei sufficit. August. loco citato.
rashness for any to affirm this without the authority of some great
Council? Which kind of Baptism their Pope Gregory the second did so far
condemn, that he commanded such persons to be Quos a Paganis baptizatos esse
asseruisti, si ita habetur, vt denuo baptizes in nomine Trinitatis, mandamus.
De Consecrat. did. 4. C. Quos a Paganis. To this authority Bellarmine
answers, that there was some defect in the form of those Pagan baptismes:
this he says only, but proves it not, whereas such baptizers were before
absolutely excepted against by a more sufficient Council: Laici baptizare
possunt, modo sint ipsi baptizati, and non bigami. Conc. Eliber. Can. 38. For
herein Pagans baptism is also contrary to these weak grounds which the
Fathers gave for tolleration of lay Christian men's baptism: Scimus etiam
Laicis licere (baptizare) vt enim accipit quis, ita dare potest. Hieron contra
Luciferian. cap. 4.
baptized again: for what promise has Christ ever made to those undertakers
of holy things?

24 Again, ancient Fathers and Councels have decreed, and that without the
limitation of the cases of necessity, that Ne ipsi quidem sanctissimae Christi
matri datum est vt baptizaret, alioqui ipsa potius quam Johannes baptizasset
Christum. Epiphan haeres 79. Non permittitur mulie^^ in Ecclesia loqui, sed nec

Austine was present: for of the exception which P. Lombard and Gratian do add,
in casu necessitatis, Bellarmine confesses, Non habetur in Tomis Conciliorum
illa exceptio. Bellar. lib. 1. de Bapt. ca^. 7.
no woman, no not the blessed Virgin, should presume to baptize. Nor can their
Cardinal Bellarmine find in all antiquity any one authority that allows it
in any case, before their late Council of In Concilio Florentino habetur, in
casu necessitatis licere laico, seu foeminae, seu Pagano baptizare, modo adsint
materia, forma, and intentio debita. Bellarm. ibid.

An Answer unto the objected ceremonies
SECT. 10.
25 Abrenunciation, which is a protestation of Tertul. lib. de corona Militis:
Sub Antitistis manu contestamur nos abrenunciare Satanae, pompae, and Angelis
eius. Centur. 3. col. 126.
renouncing the devil, and all his works etc. and the sign of the Cross, are
as ordinarily and religiously used in our Church, as they were in the days of
Origin, Cyprian, and Tertullian, and could not be objected unto those
Protestants of whom they are not rejected, without some lust of unnecessary
contention: except it be that our Adversaries do intend, by urging the use of
these ceremonies, to intimate a necessity of them. And then we answer them,
that although there has been found among themselves one Bishop, who has
defended that Baptism is of no efficacy without the sign of the Cross; yet
by their common doctrine is that opinion judged to be Refellitur error Claudij
Episcopi Taurinensis, qui dixit Baptisma esse nullum, nisi signum crucis fronti
baptizati infigeretur: Hic autem manifestus est error, constat enim cum
Christus institueret baptisma, nunquam de signo crucis meminisse. Alphons. de
Castro. lib. 3. haeres. Tit. Baptismus.
manifestly erroneous, even because, in Christ's institution there is no ment^on
of crossing. Which argument is equally sufficient to confute the necessity of
anointing, which (as their learned Alphonse says) Christus baptisma
instituens, nullum de chrismate adhibendo dedit praeceptum. Alphonsus ibid.
in the institution of Baptism was not commanded by Christ.

26 In Dionysius (whom our Apologists believe to have been S. Paul's Scholar) we
find that anciently they used to anoint Christians with oil both Meminisse
autem decet, quod in prima ad vitam spiritualem regeneratione ante baptismi
susceptionem, sit ipsi initiando positis omnibus vestibus, per totum
corpusinunctio, tanquam prima communicatio cognitionis fidei; and in fine
omnium oporationum vitae, etiam defuncto infunditur oleu^: nunc autem in
e^equijs infusum defuncto oleum significat eundem illa peregisse certamina, and
illis completis sancte esse consummatum. Dionysius de Hierarch. page 102.
Paris. 1519.
before their Baptism, and also after their death, at the time of their
burial: the first, in token that they who will be Christians, are called to be
Athletae, that is, Champions, consecrated unto a spiritual wrestling; and the
other in token (their warfare being now ended,) that their sweat and dust is
done off, when like victors and conquerers they are to take their rest. This
last unction, which is after death (whereby their doctine of Purgatory,
threatening horrible torment, and promising no present rest, may seem to
receive no little prejudice) the Romanists have neglected, and yet spare not to
impute an iniquity unto Protestants for omitting the former: when as such
ancient ceremonies may according unto the diverse conditions of times, and
discretion of several Churches, permit both their use, and change, always
with this caveat, that they be neither altered by the spirit of faction, nor
used with a superstitious opinion.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
9 Ninthly, concerning Confession, Absolution, Penance, and Satisfaction: that

then commanded, and thought necessary.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: The state of the question, as it is laid down by our
learned Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
IT is not questioned between us (as their own Admittit Caluinus generalem
confessionem, admittit etiam priuatam coram Pastore, sed addit, hanc liberam
esse debere, nec ab omnibus exigendam, nec cogendos ad enumeranda omnia peccata
praecepto aliquo, aut art inducendos, nisi quoad interesse sua purabunt, vt
solidum consolationis fructum referant. Bellar. lib. 3. de Poe^it. cap. 1. And
that all Protestants do agree in this doctrine, he shows in the same place.
Cardinal witnesses,) whether it be convenient for a man burdened with
sin, to lay open his conscience in private, unto the minister of God, and to
seek at his hands both the counsel of instruction, and the comforts of Gods
pardon: but whether there be (as from Christ's institution) such an Erat a
Christo institutum. Bellarm. ibid. Lindanus Panop. tab. 4. Opinio contraria,
haeretica est. Maldonat. Iesuita Sum. q. 18. art. 4.
absolute necessity of this private confession, both for all sorts of men, and
for every particular known sin, and ordinary transgression, as that
without it there can be no remission or pardon to be hoped for from God. The
principal differences then between Protestants and Romanists stand upon two
feet, the necessity and possibility of Romish confession: which two whosoever
shall impugn, is by the sentence and decree of the Council of Trent,
forthwith pronounced an Si quis dixerit in sacramento p^^itentiae ad remiss
peccatorum necessariu^ non esse iure diuino, omnia and singula peccata
mortalia, quorum memoria cum debita praemeditatione habeatur, -- Anathema sit.
Si quis dixerit confessionem omnium peccatorum, qualem Ecclesia seruat, esse
impossibilem -- Anathema sit. Council. Trid. Sess. 14.
Anathema. For confirmation of which confession, the Apologists have pretended
the judgment and practice of antiquity. Therefore do we first give our Reader
to understand,

That the testimonies of Tertullian and Cyprian are impertinently objected.
SECT. 2.
2 This which has been confessed, that Protestants do greatly approve the use
of private and voluntary confession, when a man either suspecteth the
unlawfulness of any action, or else when he groaneth under the sensible guilt
of a troubled soul, and shall desire the way of curing his disease, by the
comfortable pronuntiation of Gods pardon, from the mouth of him who has the
commission thereof from God, we hope our Adversaries will not dislike. But when
they further object, Cyprianus didiserte ait, in minoribus peccatis, quae quide
non in Deum committuntur, necesse est ad exomologesin venire, idque frequenter
fieri iu^e^. Cyprian as the Apologists eite it out of the Cent. 3. cap. 6. col.
127. the Centurists have been mistaken in the word minora peccata, etc.
thinking them to signify those which the Romanists call venial: for it
follows:
that private confession of thoughts and lesser sins was commanded by S.
Cyprian, as necessary for all men, and do conclude thereupon a necessity of
their private confession; we upon due enqui^ie can truly answer, that In
Cyprian lib. 3. epist. 16. Et exomologesis fiat inspecta eius vi^a, qui agit
poenitentia^, nec ad communicationem venire quis possit, nis^ prius ab Episcopo
and clero manus fuerit imposita: quanto magis in his grauissimis and extremis
delictis caute omnia and moderate secundum disciplinam Domini obseruari
oportet? Argumentum epistola est: Significatio ad plebem super lapsis, etc. and
lib 3. epist. 14. and lib. 1. epist. 3. it is exomologesis criminis.
Cyprians meaning in those minora delicta, quae non in Deum committuntur, is
greatly mistaken, because S. Cyprian does not compare public sins with
private, but public sins with public sins; because the lesser sins were
so great, that the committers of them could not be admitted (as himself
speaks) into the communion of the Church, without the absolution, and
imposition of the hands, both of the Bishop and his Clergy: and the great
sins there spoken of, were no less then lapsus tempore persecutionis, that
is, renouncing of the faith of Christ in the time of persecution, and polluting
themselves with heathenish Idolatry: this Apostasy from the faith of Christ,
which is the monster of sins, S. Cyprian compares with other scandalous
sins which men are subject unto, and did in the end resolve, that if the
lesser sins are not absolved without confession, then must these extreme
rebellions against God undergo a public censure, before that the offenders
could be received into the bosom of the Church. Hereby it is plain, that the
Exomologesis in Cyprian cannot signify any auricular confession, neither can
those minor a delicta, lesser sins, betoken any venials, nor does he mention
sins of thought, or private transgressions, but such as were possibly both
heinous in themselves, and scandalous unto the Saints.

3 The second testimony is as much misconstrued, for Potro non aliam ob causam
complurium hic testimonijs vsi sumns, quam ne quis admiretur Tertullianum de
clancularia ista admistorum confess^one nihil locutum; quae, quantum
conijcimus, nata est ex ista exomologesi per vltroneam hominum pietatem, vt
occultorum pecc^torum esset and exomologe^is occulta^ nec enim vsquam
praeceptum olim legimus. Beatus Rhenanus, Praf. in Argum Tertul. de P^nitent.
Tertullian (as their own Rhenanus upon Tertullian notes) speaks not of the
private, but of the public confession, because (says he) in those times the
private was not commanded. Let us in the second place, for trial of the truth
of antiquity, begin at the ordinance of God, whom the Philosophers called
primum, and verum, and whom we profess to be both the antiquity of truth, and
truth of antiquity. And therefore for disabling the defense of the Romish
doctrine of confession, we lay down this proposition, viz.

That the pretended Romish Confession is not from Divine institution, nor any
doctrine of faith: proved by the testimonies of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
4 The Council of Trent decreed it to be Si quis dixerit -- necessariam non
esse iure diuino, etc. Council. Trident. Sess. 14.
necessary by the ordinance of God, and will have it so believed under the
censure of Anathema upon every one that shall contradict it. The which
necessity their Cardinal Confessio figuralis necessaria erat iure diuino, and

Bellarm. lib. 3. de Poenit.. Tertia figura. Probo ex nouo Testamento. Ibid.
cap. 2. Alphons. de Castro, Tit. Confessio.
Bellarmine labors to euince, both from the figures of the old Testament,
and prescript of the new. Notwithstanding their own Authors do more
ingenuously grant the contrary: for of the pedagogie of the old Testament,
their Cardinal Tollet says, that Propositum confitendi non erat necessarium in
veteri lege. Toletus Iesuita, Instruct. Sacerd. Tract. de Confess.
the purpose of confessing was not then necessary; their Lyra reaches a note
higher, saying, that In veteri lege non omnia peccata in particulari
explicabant, quia tum impossible erat, tum propter breuitatem temporis, tum
quia Sacerdos non omnia peccata populi sciebat, sed in generali, (addit) sicut
nos facimus in principio Missae. Lyra in Leuit. 16. 21.
the Priest heard not the particular confessions of the people, for that had
been impossible, but only in general. Accordingly have others pronounced
concerning the new Testament, as their Jesuit Maldonate witnesses: Sunt etiam
inter Catholicos, qui putant nullum esse praeceptum diuinum de confessione, vt
omnes Decretorum Interpretes, and inter Scholasticos Sotus. Maldo^nat. Ies.
Sum. q. 18. art. 4. although he add, Sed haec opinio aut iam declarata est
satis tanquam haerisis, aut operaepretium faceret Ecclesia si declararet esse
haeresin, etc.
Diverse Catholics, among whom are all the Interpreters of the Decrees, do
think that there is no divine precept for this kind of confession. Which
opinion, he notwithstanding is emboldened to call now heretical, whereof their
own Glossator long since was licenced to affirm, that Melius dicitur ab
vniuersalis Ecclesiae traditione, quam noui aut veteris Testamenti authoritate
instituram fuisse. Glossator apud Gratian. de Poenit. did. 5. cap. In
poenitentia. Of this the Index Expurg. commands, Deleatur. Vide Pappum,
Collatio censurae, page 329.
it is more truly said to have been ordained by a tradition of the Church, then
by any authority either of the old or new Testament. If this be not
sufficient, we pursue further to prove

That the Romish doctrine of Confession had no being in the times long after
the days of the Apostles: as it is testified by diverse Romanists.
SECT. 4.
5 We shall not need any domestical witness for proof hereof, the
testimonies of our Adversaries being so prompt, direct, and copious in this
behalf: some of them affirming, that Erasmus annot, ad epist. Hieron. and
annot. in c. 19. Act. and in Method. Theolog. and Beatus Rhenanus annot. in
lib. Tertull. de Poenit. docent Confessionem secretam singulorum peccatorum non
modo non esse iu^e diuino institutam aut imperatam, sed neque in vsu antiquae

private confession was not ordained by God, nor practiced in the ancient
Church; but that Confessio longo tempore in prisca Ecclesia est olim public
facta. Maldonatus Iesuita Su^^m. q. 20. art. 1.
in the Primitive Church for a long time the confession then used was public:
as for the private confession, Quae non apud Graecos necessaria est, ad quos

it was not yet acknowledged in the Greek Church; which they accordingly prove
(out of Augustino, Ambrose, and Chrysostom) The question being made, Vtrum

not to have been held necessary in those times.

6 But such is the imperfection of sight in the Romanists, that they offended
as it were with the brightness of this acknowledged truth, do command such
testimonies of their own men to be Quod scilicet adulto peccatu^ non

put out. And when for confutation of their pretended necessity thereof, the
like evidence is brought from ancient historians, recording the fact of the
Patriarch Nectarius, who upon the notorious trespass of a Deacon, abrogated
the manner of private confession; then our Adversaries (as namely their two
Cardinals Bellarmine and Baronius) for answer hereunto, deal so homely with

Lie; and so (say they) is Caluins argument answered, taken from the fact of
Nectarius. We may hereby discern what kind of disputers our Apologists do
boast of, to wit, men who assume unto themselves a censorious authority of
branding ancient monuments with the note of a Lie, and make the reproach of old
historians their answer, and our satisfaction; notwithstanding this answer beso

improbable, that their own learned Jesuit Suarez ia^ supra: adding further:
Aliqui alij, vt Nectarium excusent, dicunt eum abstulisse vsum, sed tantum ad
tempus breue, ad sedandum scandalum obortum; ^amque suspensionem ad tempu^
Chrysostomi durasse. Suarez quo supra. This proves that it was not necessary.
Suarez dare support the credit of our Historians relation and report. Their
last refuge is, to answer, that Nectarius abrogated the Ex occasion eius

public confession only, as though to take away the scandal given by a
Deaco^, fornicating in a public confession, they would permit a private
confession, wherein he might have a greater shadow and covert for such a work
of darkness.

7 Let now our Adversaries bethink themselves how inconsiderately they have
answered not only unto the testimonies of Socrates and Sozomene, but unto S.
Chrysostom also, who was the successor of Nectarius, and stood against not

Suarez, quanquam non excludit eius necessitatem.
public confession, as Baronius would have it, but (as their Jesuit Suarez
confesses) against the private. Thus much of the no absolute necessity of
their commanded confession. Now follows

Of the impossibility of Romish Auricular confession: acknowledged by their
own Doctors.
SECT. 5.
8 No man will say, that any command can be justly imposed by law of
necessity, wherein there is the stamp of an impossibility of performance;
for every such law reigns not as a king, but as a tyrant: of which kind we
doubt their Decree of necessary confession will appear to be.

9 What the doctrine of Protestants is concerning the private confession of
particular sins, we permit their Cardinal Bellarmine to report: Admittit etia^
Caluinus priuatam (confessione^) coram Pastore, quando quis ita angitur and
afflictatur peccatorum sensu, vt se explicare nisi alieno adiutorio nequeat:
sed addit moderationem, vt libera sit, ne^ ab omnibus exigatur, nec necessario
de omnibus. Etenim, inquit Melancthon, connum eratio omnium impossibilis, etc.
Unto these he adioyneth the consent of Kemnitius: Non necessariam esse ait: and
Omnisi Protestantium. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Poenit. cap. 1.
Calvin (says he, and he adioyneth unto Calvin other Protestants) admits of
private confession to be made unto the Pastor, whenever any is afflicted in
his conscience, and shall have need of another help: yet with this
moderation, that this confession be free, and not exacted, and secondly, that
it do not enjoin a rehearsal of all particular sins. Herein condemning the
Roman Church (as there appears) of a double error, the first is the opinion
of necessity, to charge men upon danger of damnation to confess (if they can)
their secret sins: the second is, by the exacting an enumeration of
particulars, which is a doctrine of impossibility. The Romish kind of
necessity diverse See in the ^ormer Sections, unto whom we (...) add,
Panormitanus and Gerson eam non necessariam esse contenderunt. Gregor. de
Valent. Ies. de Missa, lib. 2. cap. 4.
Romanists have already excepted against, from the authority of Scriptures and
Fathers, and by the practice of the ancient Churches.

10 In the point of impossibility, the now practice of the Romish Church is so
maruellously exorbitant and degenerate, as that it caused their own Rhenanus
to complain, that their chief Schoolmen Scotus and Aquinas, have, by their
Deuteronomies and new rules, made a form of private confession, Aquinas and
Scotus, nimium arguti homimes talem confessionem reddiderunt, vt grauis
Theologus saepe testatus sit, iuxta illorum deuteroseis impossible esse nobis
confiteri. Beatus Rhenanus argum. in Tertull, de Poenit.
impossible to be observed: Equidem credo de hac re controuersiam nullam
futuram, si non haec salutaris confitendi medieina ab ignaris and importunis
medicis multis inutilibus traditionibus infecta and contaminata fuisset,
quibus, conscientijs quas extricare and leuare debebant, laqueos injecerunt,
and tanquam tormentis quibusdam excarnificarunt. Cassander consult. art. 11.
page 82.
insnaring (as their Cassander speaks) and tormenting the consciences of men;
whilst some of them impose a Multi Scholastici dixerunt omnia venialia
necessario esse confitenda. Maldonat. Ies. Sum. art 3. q. 18.
necessity upon the conscience, even of all venial sins that can be
remembered. We further insist, to show

The same impossibility (besides their indecent interrogatories in confession)
proved by the Canons and rules of our Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 6.
11 The Council of Trent has prescribed, and all their De mortalibus:
Circumstantiae, quae n^tabiliter aggrauant peccatum, in confessione explitare
est necessarium: eius generis sunt septem; Quis, quid, propter quid, quo modo,
quibus auxilijs, vbi, quando. Suarez Ies. ^im. 4 disp. 22.. 1.
Jesuits have proclaimed a confession of all mortal sins, with all the
material circumstances of such sins; which circumstances are seven, and are
incident unto the actions of men, to wit, [who I am that did it, what I did, to
what end, how, by what helps, where, and when it was done.

12 The reason hereof their Jesuit Maldonate has thus expressed: Vnus finis
confi^endi est, vt obligaret homines, ne ipsi iudices essent, an habeant
peccatum, and an illud fit mortale an veniale; quia plerumque imperiti sunt,
ideoque cogendl sunt exponere, quicquid fecerunt, Sacerdoti, vt iudicet
peccarent, nec^e, vt peccatores vi clausum obtinerent remissionem peccatorem.
Quapropter Sacerdos debet omnia remittere, and quia non potest remittere, nisi
qu^ audit, omnia debet audire. Maldon. Ies sum. q. 18. and art. 8. and art. 3.
and 4.
Because men (says he) commonly are no competent Judges in their own cases,
and not able oftentimes to say whether their acts be sinful or not, or if they
think them infected with sin, yet can they not descerne whether they be
mortal or venial; therefore are they compellable to confess unto the Priest
whatsoever they have done, that they may obtain remission of sin: and
because the Priest can remit no sins, but such as he hears confessed, he that
must remit all, must first hear all; Nec Sacerdos remittit vllum peccatum,
nisi poenitens proferat, quae debet, omnia. Suarez Ies. tom. 4. disp. 22.
Neither can the Priest remit any one sin, (says their Jesuit Suarez)
except the penitent confess all that he ought to confess.

13 The case is now plain, that howsoever they Reliqua peccata, quae
diligenter cogitanti non occurru^t, in vniuersum in eadem confessi one inclusa
intelliguntur. Council. Trid. Sess. 14. cap. 5.
wrap up whole bundles of forgotten sins within those which are confessed, yet
the reason which they give for the necessity of their confession shows, that
man is obliged to confess, not so much, because he judges his own act to be
sinful, as that he may be judged whether he has sinned. And because he in his
ignorance may misdeeme his own actions, taking that to be good which is a
sin, and of his sins think that to be venial, which is indeed mortal, the
party confessing is chargeable by this rule, and the Jesuits conclusion, to
reveal all whatsoever he has done, that is, whatsoever might either in word
or work be subject unto a mortal sin; the rather because (as the Jesuit
Costerus truly observes) Saepe quae leuia sunt nobis, grauia sunt Deo; quod
primos parents ob culpam, vt primo aspectu apparet, leuem, de summo gradu
dignitatis in maximas miserias cum vniuersa posteritate deturbabat. Costerus
Ies. Enchirid. Tract, de fide speciali.. Admittitur.
that may seem a light offense unto man, which is heinous in Gods sight. He
exemplifieth it in the first sin, and so he may well, for it seemed unto the
offender to be Genesis 3.
fair and pleasant, and as it were, but a venial sin; but it had a mortal,
yea an immortal worm within, which we call sin, which does engender unto
death, and to eternal bondage; not in words and works only, but even in the
inward affections, and secret cogitations. Which caused Christ to vpbraid the
Pharisees with the Matthew. 9. 4.
evil of their thoughts: for thoughts also (howsoever they be free among men,
who cannot discern them,) enter into the balances of Gods trial and
judgment.

14 The brief of all this is, to know that if there be no remission of any
sin, which is not particularly and truly confessed unto the Priest; no true
confession, which is not of all that ought to be discovered; no just
discovery, where all acts subject unto sin are not expressed; and that there
is neither word nor work, whether outward or inward, either in thought or
affection of heart, but is subject unto the contagion of sin: then must it
follow, that either their manner of confession is to no end (that is, not
necessary,) or else is it endless, and impossible.

15 Secondly, the curiosity of that art of confession, by searching and
ripping up other men's sores, has proved so loathsome, that their Bishop
Tyardaeus does greatly complain of some Jesuits, Isti vero (speaking of the
Jesuits) sancti scil. pneumatici, quibusdam interrogationum formulis circa
scrupulosas peccatorum differentias obscoena and impudica quaedam exquirunt,
quae sine vtriusque sexus interrogati (cuius ^^ribus inauditae turpitudines and
lasciuiae instillantur) rubore, and interrogantis inhonesti appetitus
titillatione vix vllis verbis, an^ ne vix quidem enuntiari possint. Pontus
Tyardaeus Episc. Cabilonens. de fratribus Iesuitis, page 35.
Who (says he) use such interrogatories in taking confessions, whereby they
may extract the most scrupulous differences of sins, either by searching into
the most obscene and filthy circumstances of the fault, so far as it can
hardly be uttered of the confessed without shame, or of the Priest without some
dishonest motion: which might peradventure be thought a defect of some few, but
that we read of their general instruction concerning the case of Vnde si
confessarius, forte dum audit confessiones, in tales incidit pollutiones, non
ob id tenetur non audire alios, nisi sit periculu^ complacentiae in pollutione.
Tollet. Ies. Instruct. Sacerd. lib. 5. cap. 13. page 567.
pollutio^, occasioned by their manner of confession. To come unto

The conclusion, showing whether the doctrine of Protestants, or of the
Romanists is more safe.
SECT. 7.
16 There are two Courts whereunto sinners are to be conuented, coeli and soli,
the tribunal in heaven, and the Church on earth: unto the first all kind of
sinners are summoned by their inward consciences daily to appear, and to look
upon God the Judge, whom some behold on the left side; such are they who stand
only in the eye of his justice, and forthwith are ready with Cain in
desperation to run away: others behold him on the right side, where they see
directly their Advocate Jesus pleading their pardons, by whom that tribunal of
the Judge is turned to a mercy seat, and they hear the gracious proclamation
of pardon unto all faithful penitents.

17 The other Court, which is of the Church militant, is subordinate unto the
former, and does exercise a jurisdiction over the consciences of men; but with
a difference, for here the examiners are but men, unable to search thoroughly
into the hearts of confessors, and consequently may err in the use of the key,
by locking and opening, that is, by condemning and absoluing amiss: but God is
the discerner of all spirits, who only Isa. 22. 22.
shuts and no man opens, and opens and no man can shut; whereby it may
happen that the innocent soul may stand bound in the inferior Courts of man's
judgment, and yet by grace be acquitted and absolved before God: which shows
that man's absolution is not of an absolute necessity. Nevertheless the
authority of particular Churches is not to be condemned, for they are Christ's
confessaries, and have a jurisdiction over public and private sinners, against
public and notorious offenders; wherein they should proceed without
partiality, as S. Paul did against the 1. Cor. 5.
incestuous, and as S. Cyprian against those See above.
Apostates. For if this were duly executed according to the power given unto
the^, then might many wretched and dissolute sinners be drawn out of Satan's
bonds, and (to allude unto the Prophet David's Psalm) they might sing and say,
Psalm. 23. 4.
Thyrod, (that is, thy shepherds staff) has comforted me: but as we cannot
but wish the vigor of this ancient discipline revived, so have our Adversaries
no cause to boast of the practice thereof; for their Jesuits do willingly
confess, that Quod non tam aperte and frequenter, and in specie res etiam ipsa
Indulgentiarum a veteribus commemoretur, causa fuit vsus seuerioris
poenitentiae, qu^ temporibus illis multum vigebat, ita vt non esset magnopere
necessarium beneficio indulgentiarum vti: postea vero decrescente feruore
poenitentiae, illarum (Indulgentiarum) vsus inualescere coepit. Greg. de Val.
Ies. lib. de Indulg. cap. 4. Paulo post initium. Quia tunc homines feruentiores
erant in bonis operibus, and minus indigebant indulgentijs quam nos, ergo non
tam amplas remissiones habebant. Tollet. Ies. Instruct. Sacerd. lib. 6. ca. 22.
as severity of discipline (used so fervently in ancient times) decreased, so
the use of Indulgences did increase. Which in effect is as much as to grant,
that their late * doctrine and practice of Romish Indulgences is the bane and
overthrow of ancient discipline: and Luther, we know, was the great Probatur
Indulgentia ex Bulla Leonis 10. contra Lutheru^, and in Decretali quam ad
Caietanum Legatu^suum misit in Germaniam. Greg Valen. tom. 4. disp. 49.. 2.
enemy unto Romish Indulgences, herein inclining to the more ancient and safer
practice.

18 Concerning private sins, which (as Origin says) must be purged by vomit
(meaning, by an orall confession unto the Church,) whereby the surfets of man's
heart, and the vndisgested gorge of a loathsome conscience is disburdened, we
also hold to be a good physic, and very sovereign for the soul of man;
which may be done either by a general confession of sins, or else by a
district acknowledgement of some particulars.

19 Of the general confession we need not dispute, their Cardinal Admittit
Caluinus, lib. 3. Instit. cap. 4. generalem (confessionem) quam Minister pro se
and populo in Ecclesia faciat. Bellarm. lib. 3 de Poenit. cap. 1.
Bellarmine does grant that this is practiced amongst Protestants: the only
question is about the other kind. And the use of private confession is (as our
Adversaries have witnessed) acknowledged by Protestants, but with a double
limitation and restraint, the first is the foresaid. 4.
freedom of consciences, the second the. 5. and. 6.
possibility of performance.

20 In both which considerations the Romish doctrine of confession may be
judged less safe, because now it is prescribed under the damnation of. 2.
Anathema, to be held both necessary and possible: which has been confessed of
their own Doctors. 3.
not to have been ordained of God,. 4.
nor practiced of the primitive Church, nor held. 4.
necessary of the Greek Church unto this day, but to have bin transformed
into a. 5. and 6.
snare of men's consciences through the impossibility of a due discharge. The
abuse whereof has been an occasion,. 6.
both unto co^fessors of pollutio^, and also unto many confessed, of grievous
and sacrilegious impi^ties: by experience whereof one of their own Divines was
moved both to Ridenda est, Theologi illius sententia, qui optime consultum iri

say and to write, that it were good, (speaking of the now Romish manner of
confessing abused by the conuerts of India) that it were taken away. Now let us
proceed.

CHAP. XV. Of penitential Satisfaction.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
That also as then Penance Centur. 3. col. 127. line 40.
or satisfaction was enjoined according to the offense, that the same Fathers

for sins, and to satisfy Gods Justice: that Whitaker in resp. ad Camp. rat.

not Cyprian only, but almost all the most holy Fathers of that time were in
that error.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: The state of the question.
SECT. 1.
EVery Protestant will easily confess, that S. Satisfactio poenitentiae est
peccatorum causas exscindere, nec earum suggestionibus aditum indulgere.
August. apud Gratian did. 3. C. Satisfactio. Quim magna deliquimus, tam
granditer defleamus, alto vulneri diligens and longa medicina non defit.
Cyprian. in Sermon. de Lapsis.
Cyprian and other ancient Fathers did enjoin unto offenders a proportionable
outward Penance, which might be properly a medicinable help, for the
mortifying of sin, and testifing his inward remorse, together with the
satisfying of the parties offended, and especially the Church of God; thereby
to procure the Churches prayers, and a ministerial absolution, with a pardon
from God. But our only question is concerning the manner of their injunctions;
whether there be not somewhat reprehensible in them. For our better discharge
in this point, we first declare,

How far these exceptions taken by Protestants, are justifiable in the
judgment of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 The taxation of ancient Fathers is only for the inconueniency of Nimis
aspere and dure locuti sunt: non tamen concedam eo sensu dixisse quo
accipiuntur a nouis satisfactionarijs, vt probo ex Chrysostom. and Augustino, qui
omnem satisfactionem referebant non ad expiationem delictorum praeteritorum,
sed ad cautionem in posterum se a peccatis abstinendi. Caluinus in loco a
Bellarmino citato, lib. 4. de notis Eccles. cap. 9. Hear Calvin himself
speak:
words which are subject to misconstructions, and not for Omnes fere veteres,
quorum libri extant, in hac part lapsi sunt, vbi de satisfaction^ agitur,
nimis aspere and dure locuti sunt. Sed non concedam eos ipsos adeo fuisse rudes
and imperitos, vt eo sensu illa scripserint, quo a nouis ipsis
satisfactionarijs leguntur. Chrysostom. enim ita scribit. homil. in Psalm. 150.
vbi misericordia efflagitatur, interiogatio cessat; vbi misericordia petitur,
poenae locus non est. Quae verba vtcunque torqueantur, cum Scholasticis
conciliari nunquam poterunt. Et Augustinus, Poenitentiae satisfactio est causas
peccatorum exscindere, nec ipsorum suggestionibus aditum indulgere. Quo apparet
illis quoque seculis ir^isam passim fuiss^ satisfactionis doctrinam, quae pro
delictis admissis rependi dicitur, cum omnem satisfactionem referant ad
cautionem, se in posterum a peccatis abstinendi, Calvin. lib. 3. cap. 4.. 38.
etc.
their sense and positive doctrine, which M. Calvin himself proves from
express doctrine of the same Fathers: whose integrity of acquitting the
Fathers from any error of doctrine, our Apologists ought in right to have
acknowledged. But seeing his name is to the Romanists so odious, that they
command it Supprimatur nomen Caluini: and loco [D. Caluinus] ponatur,
Studiosus quidam. Index Expurg. Belg. page 204.
to be blotted out, even in his sentence which, in their own judgment, is
greatly praisworthy: we marvel not that this should be thought less gracious,
although otherwise in it self never so justifiable: as may appear by the
observation which Cardinal Bellarmine bequeatheth unto his Reader, teaching
him to understand, that Satisfactio non offertur pro culpa, sed pro poena; quod
si veteres patres interdum actionibus humanis tribuere id videntur, vt pro
expianda culpa satisfaciant, interpretandi sunt ex congruo, non ex condigno.
Bellar. lib. 4. de Poenit. cap. 1.
when the Fathers attribute satisfaction unto men's actions for expiation of
sins, they must be interpreted as to understand satisfaction, or merit, de
congruo, of congruitie, and not that (which only is properly called merit) de
condigno, that is, of equal worthiness and condignitie.

3 We see then, that our Adversaries themselves dare not take the sentences of
the Fathers with their naked hands, and therefore have they cautelously
qualified their phrases with a distinction of Merit or Satisfaction, de
congruo, and de condigno: which notwithstanding is so incongruous and
successesse a distinction, that it is rejected by their own Catholicos quosdam
viros dictissimos and pientissimos adhuc video eo propendere, vt Ecclesia
meritum de congruo repellat, vt contra Patrum authoritatem ^ec^n^ inuentum.
Vega Ies. lib. 8. de Iustif. cap. 8. Et in opusc. de Merit. q. 7. page 816.
most learned (as themselves call them) and godly Divines, in the name of a new
invention, and unlawful, and repugnant to the authority of ancient Fathers.
It might therefore have behooued both these Romanists, and also our Centurists,
to have accorded to the above specified wisdom and moderation of M. Calvin,
in reproving some of their hyperbolicall and excessive phrases, and to have
been directed by their more perspicuous and plain testimonies, whereby they
clearly manifest their orthodoxall meanings: whereof we deliver our Reader a
taste, showing

That the ancient Fathers did deny, that Penitential works were properly
satisfactorie unto God.
SECT. 3.
4 Although the Fathers do sometimes exceed in phrase of speech (as has been
confessed,) terming their Penances not only medicinal corrections (which we
allow,) but even also an expiatorie price, and satisfaction of Gods divine
justice against the guilt of sin: which their Cardinal will have warily
interpreted, and in an improper sense: yet the same Fathers when they cast
their eyes upon some penite^ts, who are proudly conceited of the worthiness of
their humility, do teach such men Christus nobis propitiatio factus est: ergo
in ipso omnino Poenitentiae sacrificium ministratur and agitur, and omne quod
ex poenitentia quis consequitur, ad cum refertur. Hesychius in Leuit. 7. lib. 2.
to esteem Christ the only propitiation in Penance: and to acknowledge, that
Cum omnem vitam in peccatis detriuerim, si me poenituerit, fiamne saluus?
prorsus fies. Vnde hoc liquet? ab ipsa Domini tui benignitate, non ex tua
poenitentia mihi sumo fiduciam: poenitentia enim tua non valet tantam
abstergere malorum luem, etc. Chrysostom. de Poenit. homil. 3. sieve in
Hypomuemat. in Esalam.
it is mercy, and not only Penance, which purges the leprosy of sin. And
therefore Ergo and agendam poenitentiam, and tribuendam veniam credere nos
conuenit, vt veniam tamen tanquam ex fide speremus, non tanquam ex debito.
Ambros. de Penit. lib. 2. cap. 8.
in Penance to hope for pardon, not of right, but by promise through faith,
because Sola secundi Adami tribulatio purgat quos contaminauit offensio sola
prioris: non quod propria cuiquam sufficere possit satisfactio. Quid enim omnis
poenitentia nostra, nisi quod si non compatimur, omnino non possumus
corregnare. Bernard. de verb. lib. Job. in sex. trib. Quibus labonbus, quibus
ieiunijs possumus nostra lauare peccata? Ambros. in Psalm. 118. sermon. 20.
no penitential labors in themselves can wash our wounds; no nor the Etsi
fratres pro fratribus moriamur, tamen in fratemorum peccatorum remiss nullius
sanguis Martyris funditur; quod fecit Christus pro nobis, nec in hoc quid
imitemur, sed quid gratulemur contulit nobis. August in Ioh. tract. 84.
Martyrs, when they die for others, can be said to have power of imitating
Christ in gaining remission for other men's sins, because Christ has not
given us a virtue of imitation of him herein, but of congratulation; and then
to testify, that Ego testificor ac fide iubeo, fore vt si quisquam nostrum,
qui peccatis obnoxij sumus, recedens a pristinis malis, ex animo vereque
promittat Deo se postea nunquam ad illa rediturum, nihil aliud Deus requirat ad
satisfactionem vlteriorem. Chrysostom. de Beato Philogonio. Non dixit, si
castigaremus nosipsos, si supplicium de nobis sumemus, sed si solum velimus
agnoscere peccata, si nosipsos condemnate, liberaremur vtique ab huius and
futuri seculi supplicijs. Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. homil 28.
God (it is not then of merit, but of acceptance) accepts of sincere and
unfeigned repentance, and constant purpose of amendment of life, for our
satisfaction; Lastly, to repose our mournful souls in the Omnium piorum sub
hoc onere corruptibils carnis, and in huitis vitae infirmitate gementium, spes
vna est, quod Aduocatum habemus. etc. August. contra 2. epist. Pelagian. lib.
3. cap. 5.
hope, that we have an Advocate. It is further requisite, that according to the
order of our dispute, we further show,

How far distance there is between the now Romish Church, and the judgment
of Antiquity, in this point of penitential satisfaction. The first is want of
observation of due order.
SECT. 4.
5 This first aberration from Antiquity does appear by their practice. For
the Fathers enjoined sinners to perform some external kinds of Penances, as
medicinable cures of the sick soul, and trials of his unfeigned repentance,
before that ever they did absolve them, and restore them to the peace of the
Church; as appears by the last objected place of Cyprian, and the confession
of their own Hoc interest inter actionem poenitentiae, seu exomologesin
veteribus vsitatam, and eam, quae nunc vsu recepta est, quod olim nisi his
operibus ab Ecclesiae praefecto iniunctis rite peractis, absolutio and
reconciliatio, and communionis ius per manus impositionem non concedebatur: --
quae quidem actiones ad remissionem impetrandam. and Dei offensam placandam
valere putabantur, non quod eam dignitate sua mere^entur, sed quod eis animus
hominis ad gratiae diuinae susceptionem praepararetur. -- Hodie vero a facta
confessione manus poenitenti imponuntur, and ad communionis iu^ admittitur, and
post absolutionem opera aliqua pietatis, quae ad carnis castigationem, and
reliquiarum peccati expurgationem faciant iniunguntur; quod ipsum vtiliter
fieri potest, si periti Ministri Ecclesiae opera adhibeatur. Cassand. art. 12.
de Confessione.
Cassander.

6 But contrary-wise the Romanists (which he likewise observes) do first
absolve the confessing penitents, and afterward impose upon them the
satisfactory works. Which we note, not as thinking that works (if they be
godly) may not be wholsomly enioined, but that the pretenders of antiquity
should not be thus preposterous. Besides this,

A second Aberration, not only from Fathers, but even from their own
profession, by diverse strange and unreasonable manners of diminishing and
dissoluing of their Penance.
SECT. 5.
7 They Ieiunijs, orationibus, eleemosynis, vel alijs pietatis officijs nos
posse satisfacere. Council. Trident. Sess. 14. can. 13.
glory indeed much of their penitential acts, to wit, fasting, prayer, alms,
and other works of piety: yet so, as to instruct their Priests to use Multis
modis potest Confessor diminuere poenitentiam, -- tertio quando poenitens est
ita imperfectus, vt timor sit ipsum non accepturu^ poenitentiam, aut, si
accipit, non impleturu^.
many ways of diminishing men's Penance, as for example, when it may be doubted
that the penitent either will not receive the enjoined Penance, or else will not
perform it. The penitent cannot be offended when he may do as he will.

8 And if he be not willing to have any such Penance enjoined him, then are
they taught to use a more gentle plaster in this form: Quinto qua^do alia via
iuuantur poenitentia and satisfactio, imponendo ei omnia quae facturus est
bona, and quae passuru^ est patienter niala, loco poenitentiae, -- sciendum est
quod opera alii Deo debita. -- Si a confessario imponantur in satisfactionem,
valent vltra obligationem, cui etiam satisfaciant: quando autem Confessarius
absolute imponit poenitentiam, intelligitur de opere alias indebito: vt cum
dicit ieiuna duos dies, non intelligit dies in quibus est praeceptum ^^iunium.
Tollet. Ies. Instruct. Sacerd. lib. 3. cap. 11.
Whatsoever good thou shall do, and whatsoever evil thou shall patiently
endure, be all that unto thee in stead of thy Penance. Here is no penal matter,
which is commonly of works not commanded of God: for such works as these they
call opera alias Deo debita, that is, works which every Christian man (even
without Penance) is bound to perform unto God, and consequently here is a
Penance without Penance.

9 Again, lest that their penitents might prove refractarie and wayward
children, they have provided that the Priest in confession may Potest vnus pro
altero reiunare, vel bona opera facere, sed quod est meriti, sibi non alteri
dari potest. -- Potest igitur Confessarius imponere poenitentiam poenitenti per
se, vel per alium implendam: licet non debet facere, nisi rationabili de causa.
Idem ibid.
impose upon the party a Penance to be performed either by himself, or by
another, so that it may be sufficient if he can get another man to fast for
him. It is not heard of in physic, that one should receive health by another
man's diet, nor in Divinity, that any shall be judged but according to his 2. Corinthians. 5.
own works, or justified but by his Roman. 1.
own faith: and the law of justice teaches, that in punishment, Galat. 6.
every one must bear his own burden: yet thus they thought good to provide
for their delicate penitentiaries, by beating them upon other men's shoulders,
and inflicting insensible punishments upon them. Which kind of translation of
punishment, the ancient Fathers, if they had but dreamed of, would have
entertained with laughter, if yet the pitying of men's follies could have
permitted them to laugh.

Their third revolt from Antiquity, is their dissoluing of the doctrine of
Penance by their new doctrine of Indulgence, practicing thereby a kind of
impostureship.
SECT. 6.
10 We hear them further boast of the prescript of their Proculdubio magnopere
a peccato reuocant, and quasi fraeno quodam coercent poenae satisfactoriae.
Council. Trid. Sess. 14. cap. 8.
satisfactorie punishments, as being bridles and curbs to repress men from
sin; and yet have they found a means to loose the raines by a new art, which
is (as themselves do define) Per indulge^tias concessas satisfacit cu^ poenis

cleemosynam, vel similia opera, si indulgentiam consequatur, non tenetur subire

the Indulgence or pardon of these penitential acts, which are enjoined to a
sinner by his confessor, after absolution. And now their Church is become an
indulgent Mother indeed, for by this one Article the three strings of their
bridle called satisfaction, to wit, prayers, fastings, alms, are wholly
disanulled, by granting unto the party who should satisfy, a pardon so large,
as sometime for some Secundum vsum Sarum, quicunque in statu gratiae existens

for the the least cause, to obtain sometimes the greatest Indulgences. And
lest that any might think that any Pope, being the Father of their Church,
could so far doat in his old age, as to lavish out his Indulgences without
reason; their Jesuit does admonish his disciples out of Gratian, Vbi euidenter
non constiterit indulgentiam sine legitima causa esse concessam, contemnenda
non est. nec minoris efficaciae est reputanda, quam verba sonant. -- Ratio est,
quia Superioris factum semper est praesumendum esse legitimum and validum,
praesertim in summo Pontifice. -- De cuius iudicio dixit Gratianus, Nemini

aliquo casu contingeret committi intollerabilem errorem and manifestum in
quantitate, vel in causa indulgentiae, nunquam est public spernenda, aut

doctrinam: probatur tamen tum quia cauendum est ne cum haereticis in verb^s aut

Suarez Ies tom 4. disp. 56.. vlt.
not to hold it lawful to dispute of the Popes judgment, but to presume it to
be just, except the contrary do evidently appear. And although he should
commit some intolerable error in granting of an Indulgence, yet were not this
publicly to be despised, or freely reproved; both because we are to beware
lest we either in word or deed agree with heretics in such things, wherein the
authority of the Pope may seem to be empaired, and also because this zeal is
neither necessary nor profitable.

11 This is wholesome counsel, and well befitting a child zealous, but not of
truth. For their own Victoria Doctor of the chair, and public Reader in the
University of Salmanca in Spain, who is instiled among them for an Academiae

which we see daily (says he) sent from the Court of Rome, greater then that
the world can suffer. And his conclusion is, that it is not to be doubted, but
the Pope can err in his dispensations: and we presume, that they will hold the
privilege of the Pope to be no greater in disposing of Indulgences, then in
dispensing with laws.

12 But that which we call a mere impostureship is, first the boasting of
Penance, wherein they comprehend satisfactorie works of prayer, fasting, and
charity; which in their opinion do not only satisfy for punishment, but also
meritoriously obtain Per illa opera homo censequitur augme^tum Gratiae Tollet.

13 Secondly, when they consult concerning him who is obliged by his Penance to
give alms unto the poor, they do resolve, that An sit melius dare argentum in

Pope: Non est de necessitate Indulgentiae, vt sub condition alicuius pijoperis

work. Well, the money is paid, what shall they have for it? they doubt whether

but from what temporal punishment, they cannot consent, Quidam senserunt istis

yet is there little or no security in this traffic, whilst that (as some of

of Christ and his Saints: laying this for the ground of their faith of the
truth of all Indulgences, notwithstanding that their own teachers have been so
bold as to deny that there is any such treasure in the Church.

14 Is it now any marvel why their See above, lib. 1. c. 2.. 22
Doctors before the days of Luther have called Indulgences godly deceits: who
were herein only deceived, to call them godly? which common experience caused
others of their Church to complain, that they extinguished piety, exhausted
and made vile the keys of the Church. How then should not such a pardoner have
need himself of many pardons? or how did not Luther justly call the Popes
Bull, bullam, a bubble, in respect of their vanity? whereof, as a special
argument, we may allege the novelty of their practice: for then we ask, how
long they have thus used to pamper their yonglings? their own Doctors tell us
of a surety, that De ijs nihil express habemus nec in S. Scriptura, nec ex
dictis antiquorum Doctorum, sed modernorum. Antonin. Sum. part. 1. tit. 10. c.

this doctrine of Indulgence is not found either in Scripture, or in the
traditions of ancient Fathers, and practice thereof: Cum Purgatorium tam scrio
cognitum ac receptum Ecclesiae fuerit vniuersae, quis iam de Indulgentijs
mirati potest. quum in principio nascentis Ecclesiae nullus fuerat earum vsus?

seuerioris.
nor yet in much request before the days of Peter Lombard, who lived 1200
years after Christ; which cannot well sort with their pretense of antiquity.
Now follows

A confutation of the Romish doctrine of Satisfaction: taken from the manifold
doubts and perplexities wherewith their own Doctors are entangled in the
defense thereof; according to the confessions of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 7.
15 Here we find them wrangling and questioning among themseues concerning the
Act of Satisfaction, enjoined in Penance, Prima sententia requirit opera quae
praecepta non sunt. Reckoning seven Doctors: Ratio -- quia si opus est debitu^
ex praecepto, non potest eode^ solui debitum pro peccato. -- Tertia sententia
est, -- etiam praecepta ad satisfaciendum valere, accounting seven others and
answering, Debitum praecepti est debitum obedientiae, -- and meritorium, --
etsi poenale est, satisfactorium esse possit Suarez Ies. Tom. 4. disp. 37.. 4.
whether it be a work of precept and commandment of God, or only of
counsel and perfection, and not commanded; or if this satisfactorie work be
a work of perfection, yet whether it must necessarily Prima est, opus
satisfactorium esse per se, etiamsi nihil poenale insit. Citing four Authors.
Secunda est, solum fieri per opus poenale, quatenus poenale est. Citing eleven.
Ibid.. 6.
be penal, that is, have in it a nature of punishment and grief, or not; or
if it be penal, yet what it is, wherein the satisfactorie virtue consists,
D^^ sunt extremae sententiae: prima ponit totum valorem ad satisfaciendum in
exteriori actu: -- secunda contraria est, totum ponens in interiori. Suarez
ib.. 5.
whether only in the inward, or outward act, or in both; or if in both, yet
concerning the perfection of it, whether it stand in need of Gods acceptance,
or not. And how soever, yet concerning the effect, whether it be Quidam dicunt
fieri satisfactionem pro temporali poena, sed non pro culpa. -- Alij meliores
Theologi -- dicunt satisfactiones vere and proprie fieri pro culpa. Vega. lib.
13. cap. 36.
available for guilt, or for temporal punishment only; and if either so or
so, yet concerning the necessity, whether the satisfaction be An satisfactio
sit pars essentialis, vel tantum integralis. Paluda^us essentialem huius
sacramenti, alij integralem -- quia perfici potest hoc sacramentum nulla
satisfactione imposita. Suarez (...) supra, disp. 38.. 1. number. 18.
so essential unto the Sacrament of Penance, that there can be no absolution
without it, or no; and if it may, yet concerning the parts hereof, whether Per
contritionem ipsam, and per confessionem homo satisfacit, vnde interdum fi illa
sa^^^factio aequalis sit, non est alia necessaria, quamuis contrarium senfit
Richardus Suarez tom. 4. disp. 38.. 3.
contrition or confession will not sometime serve for satisfaction: and if
satisfaction it self shall be thought to be necessary, yet concerning the
quantity Aliqui doc^^^ satisfactionem minimam nullum effectum habere, -- alij,
totum reatum poenae tollere. Idem ibid.. 2.
whether the least satisfaction that is, be not sufficient to take away the
whole guilt of punishment, or no: and when all is done, yet concerning the
obligation, An poe^tens teneatur acceptare impositam satisfactionem; alij
(noting eight) negan^ cum teneri. -- Vera sententia est, obliga^^ pos^e vt
teneat Alleging sixteen. Suarez ibid.. 7.
whether the party confessed be chargable in conscience to undergo and perform
the Penance and satisfaction enjoined him, or no. d Vna opinio, satisfactionem
hanc non indigere promissione, aut acceptatione D^^. Alia est, totum negotium
satisfactionis nostrae positum esse in diuina acceptatione and beneuolentia.
Ibid.. 7.


16 Thus their profession in this case appears not to be founded upon
resolved principles, but upon dissolute conjectures, not knowing the nature of
their penitential works, nor the essential property of their Sacrament, nor
the validity of their satisfaction, nor the necessity thereof, either in the
priest to enjoin it, or in the penitent to perform it. We adioyne to this

A second confutation of Romish Satisfaction, in respect of their opinion of
Merit, derogatorie from Christ his personal satisfaction: by the confessions
and consequences of our Adversaries.
SECT. 8.
17 Our contention is not, whether the penitential ought by fastings and
abstainings even from ordinary and lawful delights, and in detestation of his
sin take a just revenge upon himself: which is the 1. Co^. 7. 11. Upon which
place M. Calvin thou. Caeterum quia peccata debemus vlcisci vbicunque sint,
neque id modo, sed a nobis potis^^num incipere, ^atius patet, quod hic dicit
Apostolus: loquitur enim de signis poenitentiae, hoc vnu^ est insigne inter
reliqua, dum peccata vindicando Dei iudicium quodammodo auertimus, quemadmodum
alibi docet 1. Cor. 11. Si nos iudicaremus, non iudicaremur vtique a Deo.
Caluinus in eum locum.
Apostles doctrine according to the exposition of M. Calvin; nor whether
public offenders ought to make public acknowledgement of scandalous faults,
and to endure the censure of the Church for satisfaction unto Gods people. Nor
do we make question whether we are to practice other actions of holy devotion,
for the habituating and disposing of our selves, that we may be more capable of
reconciliation with God: but whether these in their kind of Penances do in
their own nature properly satisfy Gods justice, and prevail to free men from
any punishment due unto a sin.

18 Let now this point be equally weighed in these two balances, to wit, the
Protestants objection, and the solution of the Romanists: then shall our Reader
easily discern whether profession is of more weight. Obijcitur, Si applicatur
nobis per opera nostra Christi satisfactio, vel duae sunt satisfactiones simul
^unctae, vel vna tantum: si duae, tum ^is punitur eadem culpa; si vna, vel
Christi est, vel nostra: s^ Christi, tunc nos non satisfacimus; vel nostra, and
rum aut Christum excludimus, aut cum Christo honorem diuidimus, nam i^le soluet
pro culpa, nos pro poena. Resp.
The Protestants object unto us (says Cardinal Bellarmine,) that if in our
satisfactorie works the satisfaction of Christ be applied unto us, either they
must be two kinds of satisfactions joined together, or else but one: if two,
then the same fault is twice punished in them, and so we should satisfy for
guilt: if one, then it is either Christ's, or ours: if Christ's, then do not we
satisfy; if ours, then we divide the honor of satisfaction with Christ. Hear
now our Adversaries answer: Alij respondent quod sint duae, sed vna ab altera
pendens: nam etiamsi vna suffi^eret, tamen ad maiorem Dei glotiam, cui
satisfacit, and maiorem bonorem hominis satisfacientis, placuit Christo
con^^ngere nostram satisfactionem suae: quomodo etiam homo iustus adulrus
duplici titulo ^u^ habet ad eandem gloriam; vno, ex meritis Christi sibi
communicatis per gratiam, altero, ex meritis proprijs. Qui modus non videtur
mihi improbabilis, (...). lib. 1. de Purg. cap. 14.. Quarta ratio. and Secundus
est. and. Quartus.
Some of us have answered (says the same Cardinal,) that they be two diverse
satisfactions, the one depending of the other: for though that one satisfaction
of Christ be sufficient, yet for the greater glory of God, to whom
satisfaction is made, and the more honor to man satisfying, it pleased Christ
to join our satisfaction and his own together. So that a man has a double
title unto eternal glory, the one by the merits of Christ communicated unto
him by grace, the second by his own merits. Which manner of satisfaction is
not improbable.

19 Which doctrine of joining the honor of Christ and man's in the marvelous
work of Satisfaction, (which themselves do not affirm as certain, but as
being in their own eyes only not improbable,) Protestants judge to be rather
execrable, according to the confessions of their own Doctors of See above lib.
1. cap. 2 Sect. 23.
Louaine, who have judged that no passionall works of men can be properly
called sati^factions. Therefore are we rather to apply our faith unto S.
Bernard his resolution, who being a light shining in the darkness of
superstition, at the time of his dissolution, and conflict with Satan, did not
presume of his own satisfaction joined with the satisfaction of Christ; but
contrarily, did thus commend his soul unto God: See above.
I confess (says he) that I am unworthy, and that by my own merits I cannot
attain to the kingdom of heaven: nevertheless my Lord and Savior possesses
it by a double right, the one is by his natural inheritance, the other by the
merit of his passion: he is contented with the first for himself, and the
virtue of the second he has bequeathed unto me. God grant that every
Christian whenever he shall take his last sleep, may lay his head on this
pillow. We add

A preoccupation or prevention of an objection usually obtruded by the
Romanists, imputing unto Protestants a licentiousness in their Religion; but
are confuted by comparison in one Article of Contrition.
SECT. 9.
20 Secundu^ Lutherum haec Gratia non inf^mditur absque magna animi
concussione: vehemens igitur animi concussio cum nequeat non fentiri dum adsit,

12. aduersus Luther.
Luther (as our Adversary, their Bishop Roffensis notes) says, that grace is
not infused into the heart of any sinner, except there be so great an
affliction of spirit, that he cannot but feel it, otherwise he makes but a
confession without contrition. So likewise the other Protestants Docet
Kemnitius contritionem acrem and vehementem: and Caluinus nullos, nisi
conscientia vulneratos, sincere Dei misericordiam implorare. Bellar. lib 2. de
Poenit. cap. 10.. Vt incipiamus, partim cap. seq.
Kemnitius and Calvin teach (as their Cardinal observes,) that the contrition
must be compungent and vehement in a wounded conscience, which shall obtain
grace and mercy. As for the Romanists, they for the perfection of Penance can
be contented with a Ad perfectionem poenitentiae secundo requiritur tenuis

small grief of mind, which their Jesuit Nam quod absolutionis beneficio

Acosta gathers from the words of the Council of Trent: and thereupon will
have it to be a point so certain as almost to be numbered amongst the doctrines
of faith; whereof their Jesuit Tolet does conclude, saying, that Contritio vna

Fathers does accord. Now then contrition and sorrow of heart being the soul of
repentance, whether they that challenge the vehement, or they who are content
with the remiss grief, are like to be the better professors of true Penance,
let our Reader judge: and for his more direct view we add * 2. Cor. 7.


A conclusion, manifesting (by way of appeal) on whether side (of Romanists or
Protestants) the religious security in this case does rather stand.
SECT. 10.
21 We may recognize what has been already proved at large, and is in the
Romish profession, in this question, most obserueable, teaching us a less. 9.
sorrow for sin, and a more presumption in. 8.
Merit; being hot in the ch^se of the. 1.
words of ancient Fathers, but cold in pursuit by their. 3.
judgment; dissenting also from antiquity by a preposterous. 4.
absolution, by unreasonable diminutions, and dissolutions of all their
penitential works, in. 5.
permitting their penitents to perform them either by other works, (which,
notwithstanding their Penance, they are bound in conscience to fulfill) or by
other men's works: or finally not to accept of Penance except he list. And
howsoever they remain ignorant of the. 7.
necessity both of the duty of performing such works, and also of the
benefit of performance, whether they be behoouefull for mortal or for venial
sins, whether for remission of guilt, or only of temporal punishment. And
notwithstanding the greatest necessity, and worthiness of their satisfactions
that can be imagined; yet have they instructed their people rather to. 6.
purchase the Popes Indulgence, the strangler of Penance: and yet must this
traffic also stand upon such hazards, as peradventure to obtain for their
money a piece of a Pardon in stead of a full, or one in steed of many; and yet
so to enjoy this one, as that it be always reuocable at the Popes secret
pleasure, yea although it be without cause: which pardon also perhaps he had no
more authority to grant, the^ a man has in a dream by an. 6.
imagined treasury of the Church, void of all warrant either of Scriptures, or
of true antiquity. From all which perplexities of contradictions, presumptions
of self -Merit, and sales of deceit, the profession of Protestants is most
free; who exact of all penitents that shall desire any spiritual comfort, no
light, but a. 9.
vehement compunction of spirit, and continual fruits of repentance; without
either diminution or dissolution, so far as they shall be medicinable unto
man, or acceptable unto God: yet so, as not to ouerprize their actions, calling
them proper satisfactions; which estimation diverse. 8.
Romanists have equally condemned. And now whether profession appears to be
more sound, we permit unto the indifferency of our Readers judgment to
conclude. We pass on unto the next point

with the now like used ceremony of imposing his hand.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing the state of the question.
SECT. 1.
WHereas the practice of the Romanists is first to absolve, and then to impose
satisfactions, the dispute of these Apologists is contrarily, first to entreat
of satisfaction, and afterward of the point of absolution. But to come to the
matter, whereunto in this question we need not to reply much, seeing our
Adversaries have herein so little to object:

2 They mention two points, absolution, and the ceremony used therein, which
is imposition of hands: but it seems not that they urge the matter of
absolution it self. And indeed the power of absolution, whether it be general
or particular, whether in public or in private, it is See our Service book in
both.
professed in out Church: where both in her public Service is proclaimed
pardon and absolution upon all Penitents, and a private applying of absolution
unto particular Penitents by the office of the Minister; and greater power then
this no man has received from God. And now we deliver

A proof of the profession of Protestants, by the testimonies of our
Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
3 Our Adversaries do not profess an absolute absolution, but such an one as
is bounded with an exception of non ponendi obicem, that is, except the party
who is absolved, by want of faith or repentance do put a bar, which unto man
is invisible. Notwithstanding it were well they would have had the moderation,
with P. Lombard, to discern aright of man's jurisdiction in the office of
absolution, as namely to understand, by that saying of Christ unto the Pastors
of the Church, [* whose sins you remit on earth, they are remitted in heauen]
Quomodo vero dicitur, Quodcunque solueris super terram, solutum est in coelis?
al^quando enim ostendunt solutos and l^gitos, qui non ita sunt apud Deum; nam
in lignos l^gant and sol^^nt. Sed intell^gen ^im est (...) -- Vnde Origenes,
interdum qui for as mittitur, intus est, and qui for as est, intus videtur
re^meri. P. Lombardus (...)
that such only are worthily absolved of the Church; who are also absolved in
heaven; because by the e^rour of man it may so happen, that he that seems to
be cast out of Gods family, be still within; and he who may be thought to
remain within, is notwithstanding cast out: and that therefore Aliter Deus
soluit, vel hgat, aliter Ecclesia, ipse enim per se tantum dimittit peccatum,
quia (...) macula, and a debito aeternae mortis soluit: non autem hoc
Sacerdotibus concessit, quibus (...), id est, ostendendi homines ligatos and
solutos potestatem: vnde Dominus (...) is per se restituit, deinde ad
Sacerdotes misit, quorum iudicio ostenderetur muodatus. Lombar^^ (...).
God absolueth differently from the Church: God by remitting the sin and
purging the soul of the blemish thereof, and freeing it from eternal
punishment: whereas the Churches power of binding and loosing consists in
declaring who are bound and absolved of God: even as it came to pass (says
he) when Christ by his power cleansed the leprous parties, and after sent them
to the Priest, to be by his judgment shown and manifested to be clean.

4 Nevertheless it is not likely that the Romanists will suffer this Master of
their elder School to instruct their new disciples, seeing that when they find
the same in the Gloss of their Decrees, they either compel that Gloss to
speak Dimittantur, id est, dimissa ostend antur, etc. did. 23. cap. 2. Gloss.
otherwise, or else command it to be Deleatur tota haec Glossa. Iudex Expurg.

The Imposition of hands:
SECT. 3.
5 This point is of no great moment, because it cannot challenge any necessity
of precept: neither is it esteemed by our Adversaries to be any essential part
of absolution, which may concern either the Materia absolutionis est peccatum
confessum, contritum, and satisfactori expositum. Ibid. lib. 2. cap. 1.
Absolutionis forma est haec; Ego te absoluo, etc. Ibid. lib. 3. cap. 12.
matter or form, and so assume unto it self the necessity of a Sacrament:
which we think may be reckoned with that ceremony of imposition of hands,
used in the office of Confirmation; Dicit Hieronymus, impofitionem manuum

esse. Gregor. de Valent. Iesuita, lib. de number. Sacrament. cap. 3.. Respondeo.
which S. Jerome said (as their Jesuit does witness,) was used in many places
rather for the honor of Priesthood, then by necessity of commandment.

6 To be brief, as it behooves the one side not to be scrupulous in such
things, so will it become the other not to show themselves too superstitious in
matters of outward ceremonies, but above all things to seek reformation of the
heart, for the edifying of souls unto life. And if any will persist so to
strive about things indifferent, either pro or c^ntra, as thereby to make a
schism among Professors, we choose to be of that Church whereof S. Paul said,
1. Cor. 11. 16.
We have no such custom, nor yet the Church of God.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing first the purpose of the Romanists, in
insisting so much upon the word Rock.
SECT. 1.
Our Adversaries have now at length brought us unto the chief arch, and that
we may so say, the highest pinnacle of their Romish Temple, to wit, primarie
and plenarie jurisdiction of their Popes over all Bishops, which they seek to
derive from the pretended supremacy of S. Peter over all the other Apostles;
and the foundation hereof they lay upon their exposition of this word, Rock:
which is their last refuge in all their disputes. Therefore will it concern
them to maintain this hold, which they endeavor to do, especially by the
testimonies of some Fathers: whereunto we answerably appeal, first concerning
the exceptions used by Protestants, showing that

Notwithstanding that the word Rock shall point at S. Peter (according unto
the exposition of some Fathers,) yet does not this so fully advantage the
Romish claim: even by the judgment of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 The now Romish purpose is known to intend, that if the word, Rock, should
betoken Peter, thereupon presently to build a monarchical palace, which they
call See the Sect. 8.
praeceptinam potestatem, that is, a commandatory power and jurisdiction of S.
Peter over all the other Apostles: not considering that which Nisi forte sic
excusandurs fit Cyprianus, quod Petruni non pro homine, sed pro typo accepit,
propemodum indicant quae sequuntur; Vnus, inquit, pro omnibus loquens, and
Ecclesiae voce respo^dens, ait, Domine quo ibimus? Itaque Petrus saxeus
Ecclesiae sedem repraesentat. Erasmus (...). in Matthew. 16.
Erasmus has observed as probable in the sentence of S. Cyprian, viz. that
although Christ had called Peter the Rock, yet it was not to make Peter the
imperial top, but the representative type of the Church: that as he answered
in the name of all, so every one professing the same, might be a Petrus in his
kind. Accordingly, Cardinal Etsi Petrus per Petram lapis fundamenti intelligi
deberet: (...) secundum sanctum Hieronymum, ita similiter alij Apostoli ^^erunt
lapides Ecclesiae, vt Apoc. 11. (...) lapides. Cardin. Cusanus lib. 2. de
Conco^^. E^cl^s. cap. 13.
Cusanus from S. Hierome answers, that although the word, Rock, should
betoken S. Peter to be the foundation-stone, yet so likewise were the other
Apostles called the stones of the Church.

3 Lastly, there is a primacy of order and degree, and there is a primacie of
authority and jurisdiction: the first, with S. See hereafter. 7.
Hierome, Protestants will easily ascribe unto S. Peter; but that of
jurisdiction is as hardly proved by our Adversaries, as it is by Protestants
easily denied.

4 It is true that the Centurists have taken exceptions unto the sayings of
Optatus, and Arnobius: and therefore would we further know whether their
exceptions be true. Optatus said, that Peter had his name Cephas, as signifying
Caput, that is, head, from the Greek word (...): and thereupon he calls
Peter the head of the Apostles. Which descant as it is by our Etsi Petrum
sedisse Romae Aposlolorum omnium caput, vnde and Cephas appellatus sit, tamen,
etc. Cent. 4. col. 556. line 17.
Centurists disliked, so is it applauded in some sort by our Cepha, tale nomen

Pasce oues meas. The Centurists resell this, thus, -- Nam Petrus ipse (...).
cap. 5. ad Presbyteros eodem vtitur vocabulo, cum ait, Pascite gregem Christi.
Et Paulus, Ephesians. 4. Alios posuit pastores, etc.
Pastor, which our Adversaries themselves do accordingly confute by Scriptures
and Fathers, as the eight and ninth Sections following do fully manifest. But
because our first contention is about the sincere exposition of the word,
Rock, we orderly proceed and prove

That this chiefly pretended foundation of Popedom is ruinous, by the general
expositions of ancient Fathers, who teach that by, Rock, in Matthew. 16. Christ
is signified, and not Peter.
SECT. 3.
6 This question has been often debated, whether by [Rocke] is meant Christ,
whom S. Peter confessed, when he said, Thou art Christ the son of the living
God:] or the person of S. Peter himself; which now we offer to be decided by
the verduict of ancients. Chrysostom says thus: Christus est fundamentum,
ipse enim dicit Petro [Tu es Petrus, and super hanc Petram.] Chrysostom. hom. de
cruce Dom. circa medium. Rursu^: Super hanc petram, dixit, non super hunc
Petrum; non enim super hominem, sed super fidem aedificabat Ecclesiam. Sermon. de
Pentecost. paulo ante finem: and homil. 55. in Matthew.
Christ said [super hanc petram,] that is, [vpon this Rock,] he said not
[super hunc Petrum,] that is, [vpon this Peter:] for Christ built his Church
upon the faith, and not upon the man. Hilarie, Gregory Nyssene, Cyrill, all say
thus; Vna haec est fidei petra, Petri ore confessa cum dixit, Tu es filius Dei.
Hilar. lib. 2. de Trinit. cap. 6. Gregor. Nyssen. in testimon. vet. Testam. de

That was the Rock which Peter confessed, saying of Christ, Thou art the son
of God. Theophylact likewise (as a learned Jesuit witnesses) says thus, [
[Hanc] id est, super Christum, quem ^u confessus es. Theophylact. comment. in
Matthew. 16. At also Emanuel Sa Ies. annot. in Matthew. 16.

is he inclined rather by the word Rock to understand Christ: saying in the
person of Christ to Peter; I will not build me upon thee, Peter, but thee upon
me.

7 We may add unto this Synod of Fathers one, whom the Apologists have placed
in their first Chapter for the supreme patron of their faith; and who sitting
in the seat, and (as they call the Roman Bishopric) chair of S. Peter,
eue^ S. Gregory, says plainly thus: Apostolus dicit, 1. Cor. 3. Aliud
fundamentum nemo potest ponere praeter id quod positum est, quod est Christus
Jesus ipse Dei atque hominum mediator, qui ad ipsum Apostolorum principem ait.
[Tu es Petrus, and super hanc petra^, etc.] Ipse enim est petra, a qua nomen
Petrus accepit. Greg. in Psalm. Poenitent. in illa verba, [Initio tu, Domine.]
Christ named himself the Rock. Therefore M. Calvin had just cause to say,
that he In Petro fundatam esse Ecclesiam, quia dictum est, [Tu es Petrus:] sic
aliqui Patres. -- Subiungit: Neque hic ideo Patrum authoritatem repudio, quia
eorum testimonijs destituor ad probandum quod dico, si citate libeat; sed quia
in re tam clara disceptans molestus esse Lectoribus nolo. Caluinus Institut.
lib. 4. cap. 6.. 6. As for most of the testimonies produced out of the Fathers
for the contrary exposition, they understand by Rock, by a metonymicall
implication, the Rock Christ, whom Peter confessed.
refused not the testimonies of Antiquity herein, as being forlorn of their
patronage, but for fear of wronging his Readers, by some tedious superfluity.

8 These places are not unknown unto our Adversaries, which necessarily
ruinate the principal foundation of Popedom, which they labor seriously to
fortify, answering unto such objected authorities of Fathers; but (alas) so
weakly, as though they meant to preuaricate in their cause. For we are ready
to show,

That the answers, which the most learned Romanists do make unto the alleged
authorities of the Fathers, are apparently dissonant and dissolute.
SECT. 4.
9 The chief leaders, and as it were, commanders amongst the Romanists,
understanding of this great breach made upon them by so many forces of these
forecited authorities, do seek to repair it by the art of distinguishing, in
this manner: Sed nos respondemus, confessionem Petri duobus modis considerari
posse; vno modo absolute and secundum se, sine relatione ad personam Petri;
altero modo cum relatione ad Petrum. Priore modo fides non est fundamentum.
Bellar. lib. 1. de Pont. cap. 10.. Respondetur. Cum dicunt Patres, Confessionem
istam esse Petram, intelligunt cum relatione ad Petrum confitentem. Maldonat.
Ies. comment. in Matthew. 16. Stapleton. de doctrine. princip. lib. 6. cap. 3. and
5. Loquitur Christus de ^dificatione passiua, qua Petrus erat aedificatus super
Christum. Stapleton. ibid. cap. 2. in eundem finem alia. Grego^. de Valent.
Ies. Analys. lib. 7. cap. 1. and West^^^^ de trip. hom. offic. lib. 3. cap. 15.
We answer (say they) that the confession of Peter may be two ways considered,
either absolutely in it self, or else respectively by a relation unto S.
Peter: the Fathers when they call the faith or the confession the Rock, they
do not take those words simply, but only respectively, that is, with a
reference unto Peter, as if the meaning were this; that not the faith or
confession of Christ (as we call it) in abstracto, or in it self, (teaching
that Christ is the eternal Son of God) is the Rock, and sufficient
foundation for a Christian to build his faith upon, except it be believed with
a personal respect unto S. Peter, that is, no otherwise to profess that faith
and confession to be the Rock, then as it was S. Peter's faith, and S. Peter's
confession.

10 But the Fathers in their forecited testimonies were so far from
respecting Peter, in expounding faith, or confession of Christ, to be the
Rock, that they did precisely exempt and separate him from it, distinguishing
therein between the Rock and Peter, as between hanc and hunc, that is, this
Rock, and him, which is Peter; so See above. 3. a.
Chrysostom: or as between Christ confessed, and Peter the confessor; so See
ibid. lit. b.
Cyrill, See ibid. lit. b.
Hilarie, See ibid. lit. b.
Gregory Nyssen, and Ibid lit. ^.
Emissenus: or as between Christ the foundation it self, and the builder,
Peter; so Ibid. lit. b.
Anselme: or as between Christ himself, and an other; so Ibid. lit. l.
S. Gregory: yea, and so expressly, as to say, that the Rock is not Peter, but
Christ; so Ibid. lit. ^.
Chrysostom, and S. Ibid. lit. i.
Augustine. Vainly therefore have our Adversaries sought to elude so plain and
grave testimonies, as though the Fathers could have possibly fancied S. Peter
to be both the faith confessed, and the confessor; both the foundation, and the
builder; both me and thee, this and the other; Christ, and Peter himself. Let
it not be thought a matter impertinent to propound

A Confirmation of the former sense, by a clear demonstration.
SECT. 5.
11 That (in the sayings of the Fathers) which S. Peter confessed, was the
Rock: but S. Peter did confess Christ, and not himself: Ergo (in the Fathers
meanings) not Peter, but Christ was the Rock. And the truth of the same
interpretation of the Fathers, may be further illustrated and euinced by a
plain, and not improbable supposition; by admitting some godly and faithful
men in the days of our Savior, to have believed (according unto S. Peter's
confession) [Christ to be the eternal son of God,] who notwithstanding had
never heard of the personal faith, or yet so much as of the name of S. Peter.
From this we may thus argue: Either were such believers not built upon the
Rock, and so some sanctified and faithful believer in Christ should not be
built upon the Rock: or if any such were truly built upon the Rock, who never
believed in S. Peter, then the word Rock has no necessary reference or
respect unto S. Peter.

12 This supposition may not be judged frivolous, seeing that Origin who is one
of the most ancient Fathers, doubted not to say, that Quod si nos quoque
loquuti fuerimus, quod dixit Petrus, [Tu es Christus filius Dei viui:] tanqua^
non accepta reuelatione a carne and sanguine, sed a luce corda nostra
illucesce^te, a Patre, qui in c^x lis est, efficimur Petrus, and nobis dicitur,
quod hunc sermonem sequitur, Tu es Petrus, and quae sequuntu^i Petrus enim est
quisquis Christi discipulus. Origin, Tract. 1. in Matthew.
Whatsoever Christian he be, that shall confess as S. Peter did, saying of our
Savior, [Thou art Christ the son of the living God,] receiving this
revelation not from flesh and blood, but from divine illumination; the same is
made a Peter; and unto him is said that which was spoken unto S. Peter, [Thou
art Peter.] But why do we so much contend to receive our exposition from the
testimonies of Fathers, which we may have granted us by

The confes^ions of our learned Adversaries, wherein the word Rock, is
expounded to signify Christ, and not Peter?
SECT. 6.
13 If, besides the judgment of ancient Fathers, the learned Romanists
themselves shall be found to subscribe unto our former exposition, we are in
good hope that our Reader will therein magnify the power of truth. Now then
(to assemble our witnesses) their learned expositor Super hanc patram quam
confessus es, id est, super Christum. Lyranus in Matthew. c. 16.
Lyra, their preacher Hugo Cardin.
Ferus, and Cardinal Fer us in Matthew. 16.
Hugo, by Rock, expound Christ; their common Gloss upon the Papal Decrees,
fixes a Per h^^ verba, credo, Christum non aliud demonstrasse, quam haec verba
quae Petrus respondit Domino, cum dixit [Tu es Christus filius Dei viui,] quia
super co articulo fund aea est Ecclefia. Ergo super scipso fun lauit Deus
Ecclefiam. One of the Glosses in Great. did. 19. c. Ita Dominus.
credo, that is, a belief upon it: their Cardinal Cusanus is confident in the
matter, and ventureth against their Quanquam Petro dictum est, [Tu es Petrus,
and super hanc Petram:] tamen per Petram, Christum, quem confessus est,
intelligimus Card. Cusan. Concer. Cath. lib. 2. cap. 13.
notwithstanding, to affirm, that by the Rock, is meant Christ.

14 And lest any may peradventure suspend their judgment until they hear
some Jesuit speak, Christus est Petra, super quam (Matthew. 16.) fundata est
Ecclesia. Pertrius Iesuita Comment in Dan. 2. in ea verba, [Lapis abseissus.]
Pererius says, that Christ is that Rock (noting the place of Matthew. 16.)
upon the which the Church is built: and their other Jesuit Salmeron shows,
that Ephesians. 2. Superae dificati eslis super fundamentum. Intelligi Christus
potest, seu fides eius, iccirco in singulari numero dixit, fundamentum.
Salmeron Ies. commen. in Ephesians. disp 6. I take this testimony from the
consequent only, and not from the antecedent.
Christ is that foundation mentioned Ephesians. 2. His reason is, because the word
foundation, is put in the singular number: the consequence which peradventure
he borrowed from Fundamenta quando plur aliter ponuntur, Doctores signific^^ti
quando singulariter, Doctorum Doctorem Christum Iesum. Beda in Matthew. 16.
Bid. Now there Rock and foundation, implying the same thing, may admit the
same conclusion: which S. Gregory well observed, when he said, that In
saenloquio quando in singulari numeto, fundamentum dicitur, nullus alius nisi
ipse Dominus designatur, de quo and Paulus art, 1. Cor. 3. Fundamentum aliud
nemo potest ponere, -- quod est Christus Jesus, ipse enim est fundamentum
fundamentorum. Greg. lib. 28. in Job, cap. 38.
in holy writ, when the word Foundation is used in the singular number, who
else can be understood but Christ, even as S. Paul witnesses (says he) unto
the Corinthians, saying, that the Rock was Christ? This we think, is forcible
enough for the satisfaction of any indifferent Reader: but that argument which
follows, is able to convince and convert an obstinate: wherein we show,

That the whole tenure of Scripture does confirm our former signification,
proving that the word Rock, must betoken Christ: from the best rule of
expounding of Scripture, according to the judgment of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 7.
15 The safest and most justifiable manner of interpretation of the Scripture
(as the Fathers teach) is, to expound Scripture by the analogy of Scripture:
thereby allowing unto God that right, which a man will permit unto enery man,
which is, to be the best expositor of himself.

16 There is but one instance fitting this point, which our Adversaries take in
all the Bible, as namely, Isay. 28. 16. [Behold I put in Sion a tried stone, a
precious corner stone, a sure foundation.] Which Cardinal Quis sit hic lapis
netno Ignorant, qui Fuangelium legit, ^bi Christus Petrum petram vocat, qua

that text) be broken in pieces. Thus please they themselves in their fancied
Gloss, whereby belike they sought to demerite the Pope.

17 Notwithstanding many of their own learned Lapidem probatum, Esa. 28. id

Authors, (viz. Hector Pintus, Caietane, Aquinas, accompanied with three
Jesuits, as namely, Salmeron, Maldonate, and Pererius) do by that stone
understand only Christ, confirming their exposition by the joint consent of all
ancient Fathers, and analogy of these Scriptures, as Psalm. 117. The stone which
the builders refused, is become the head stone of the corner; expounded by S.
Paul, Romans 9. out of Esa. 8. Behold I will put in Sion a stone of offense, and
a rock of stumbling; and Dan. 2. The stone hewn out of the mountain, without
men's hands, signifying Christ, was borne of a Virgin, without the help of
man's generation: and Zach. 9. Behold the stone which I have given you, whereon
there are seven eyes, signifying the seven gifts of the holy Ghost, peculiar
unto Christ: and 1. Cor. 10. The rock was Christ, by figurative representation:
and 1. Cor. 3. 11. Another foundation then that which is laid, can no man lay,
which is Christ: and Act. 4. 11. This is the stone refused of the builders. And
Matthew. 21. 44. Upon whom this stone shall fall, it will beat him in pieces.

18 Lastly, the same saying of Esa. 28. which has been wrested to prove S.
Peter to be the precious cornerstone, is (as their own Ribera truly notes)
Inde toties Christus d^citur lapis. Esa. 28. [Ecce ego mittam in fundamentis
Sion lapidem, lapidem probatum, angularem, pret^olum, in fundamento fundatum:]
quod cut dicatur, Petrus exposuit 1. Per. 2. 4. dicens, Gustate quam dulcis est

Deo autem electum and honorisiearum. Et verse 6. Ecce pono in Sion lapidem, etc.
Ribera Ies. comment. in Amos 9. number. 21.
expounded by S. Peter himself, to signify the Lord Christ. This harmony of
Scriptures, by consent of Fathers, and accordance of so many confessions of
their own Authors does ratify the position of S. Gregory, to prove, that by
Rock or foundation in the singular number, only Christ is signified; which
makes fully for the certainty of our conclusion. From expositions we come
unto assertions, and further reioyne,

That in the judgment of ancient Fathers (concerning the word Head) Peter had
no such Imperial commandouer the other Apostles, as our Adversaries pretend.
SECT. 8.
19 The Romish doctrine now commonly defended is, to attribute unto Saint Peter
such a power over all other Apostles, as to have been the Accepit Petrus

universal Bishop above all, and to have had authority of commanding all,
and that other Apostles had only the authority of putting in execution that
which was commanded by S. Peter. Now if the jurisdiction of Peter had been so
preeminent, then S. Cyprian must have deceived us, in saying, that Parem

Church is equally built upon them all.

20 As for our Adversaries arguments taken from diverse titles of excellency,
which ancient Fathers have ascribed unto S. Peter, we esteem them little
better then trifles, as being utterly unfit to conclude a monarchical
supremacy of Peter over the rest: otherwise they must accuse the Fathers of a
sacrilegious impiety, for derogating from the dignity of S. Peter, by
honoring others with titles of equal authority; Ruffinus calling S. James

not inferior unto S. Peter. And again S. Gregory, speaking of primitive
Antiquity, and saying, that Petrus vniuersalis Episcopus non vocatur. Greg.

Peter was not called the universal Bishop. By all which we see that title
ascribed, by ancient Fathers, unto other Apostles, which our Adversaries do, in
their Popes behalf, proclaim to be proper unto S. Peter; but vainly, as has
been proved, and may yet be made more evident by

The confessions of our learned Adversaries, acknowledging that the pretended
prerogative of S. Peter is not proved out of Scriptures.
SECT. 9.
21 Whatsoever our Adversaries can plead out of holy Scripture for the
establishing of Peter's prerogative over the other Apostles, must be either
taken from some promise made unto S. Peter, or else from some practice executed
by him: but there is no evidence in holy writ, in either of these respects.

Adversaries for See the Catalogue of Auth^^* before the book, at the name of

a man most skillful in divine Scriptures, and the Prince of Divines in his
time, who was most earnest and vehement in desending of Pope Eugenius, and had
the title of the Cardinal of S. Peter's ad vincula: so that they cannot justly
except against this witness; as though he either could not, or would not
advance the authority both of Saint Peter and the Pope by the best reasons he
had, yet he concludes upon his knowledge, that Sed scimus quod Petrus nihil
lus potestatis a Christo accepit alijs Apostolis. 21. did. in notio 24. q. 1.
S. Peter had no more authority then the other Apostles. Which he proves by
Nihil enim dictum est ad Petrum, quod etiam alijs dictum non sit: Nonne, sicut
Petro dictu^ est, Quodcunque ligaueris, -- ita alijs est dictum, Quemcunque
ligaueritis? -- ^t quanquam Petro dictum est, Tu es Petrus. -- Si Petrus per

2. Concord. Cathol. cap. 13
instancing against all the promises, which our Adversaries object for the
predominance of S. Peter.

23 Secondly, from the practices of S. Peter they have also so little hold,
that when we require that they should show acts recorded in holy writ, wherein
it may appear that S. Peter did at any time exercise their pretended dominion
over but any one of the other Apostles, then their ancient Jesuit Salmeron is
brought into that strait, as to hold it his best evasion to answer, that
Petrus videbatu^ quodammodo pastoratum suum negligere, and inter eos tanquam
aequ^lem, non tanquam maiorem se ge^ere. Salmeron Ies. commen. in 1. Pet. 1.
disp. 1. We speak not of his authority over other Pastors (which Salmeron
there confuteth) but over the Apostles.
Peter seems in a sort to have neglected his Pastorship. Which is an impotent
shift, detracting from S. Peter's faithfulness, and is notably prejudicial to
their own cause.

24 But that we may conclude this point iudiciously, and more acceptably, we
will do it from the pen of one of their Doctors, whom they themselves have
commended to be the En Theologiae praeceptorum summum, quem Hispania Dei
beneficio accepit. Canus loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 1. intitio.

defend the prerogative and primacie of S. Peter with all his power and might.
This their so commendable, and so zealous a Doctor, has published for his
conclusions, that both by the mandates of Christ, and by the acts and deeds of
the Apostles, viz. Potestatem Apostoli receperunt immediate a Christo, -- quod

all the Apostles received all their power, both of Order and Jurisdiction,
immediately from Christ. Which (howsoever he labors to qualify it, by other
conclusions) must overthrow the doctrine of the motherhood of their Church.
Which, besides the strength of Scripture, he confirms by the testimony of S.
Cyprian, confuting also the Romish Gloss, which in zeal unto S. Peter
corrupts S. Cyprians meaning, who intended to equalize other Apostles with
Peter. But we are called from the perusal of S. Peter's titles, unto the
visitation of his Chair.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 10.
25 Here the obiectors seem to be very zealous of the dignity of S. Peter,
especially in commemorating the yearly solemnity and celebration of his feast
for the honor of his See. But what See of Peter is meant they willingly
conceal, carrying the matter in a mist, peradventure to the end that their
Reader might imagine that all this dignity of S. Peter's See does properly
belong unto the Sea of Rome; when as they might even in a word have given some
intimation to their Reader, not only out of the objected Authors Festum

Bellarmine recounting the prerogatives of S. Peter above the other Apostles,
scoreth up for the twentieth, that only those three Churches, wherein Peter
did sit as Bishop, either by himself or some other, as namely, Rome,
Alexandria, and Antioch, were anciently acknowledged for Patriarchall Seats:
and that only because of the dignity of S. Peter. And after for the Vigesima

seven and twentieth argument of his prerogative, he alleges the now objected
feast in honor of his chair at Antioch: which he does to this end, that Rome
as a correlatiue may be much more dignified by the person of S. Peter, because
forsooth he lived and died in this chair.

27 We now see their intent, and by it discern the unsoundness of their
judgment: for if these forenamed respects be arguments of S. Peter's
prerogative and dignity above the other Apostles, what shall we think of the

who, notwithstanding that he was not ignorant (as their Binius confesses)
that the Council of Nice had otherwise decrced, yet in the superscription of
his letters he gave the Bishop of Constantinople the pre-eminence? Must not all
these be judged, by the Romanists collection, to have been, in a manner,
traitorous in ecl^psing the light and honor of S. Peter, by abasing of his
chair of Antioch? If this be not sufficient to display the vanity of our
Adversaries dispure, we shall supply

A second manifestation of the weakness of their Argument, by retorting it
upon themselves, to the prejudice of their cause.
SECT. 12.
28 The reason of that feast of the chair of Antioch was, As may be gathered
out of S. Augustine.
because the episcopal and ordinary settled Ministry in the Churches (by
which the faith of Christ has ever since been maintained) then and there first
began: or rather, As may be observed both out of ^eo and Bid.
because by the blessed success of S. Peter's preaching, there the believers
did first take upon them the glorious name of Christians, by which name they
were forthwith distinguished from all other professions in the world.

29 But the Romish inference, which from the festival of that See of S. Peter,
does conclude a supremacy of jurisdiction over all other Apostles, is by our As
for Daneus, who is objected, calling Bellarmines arguments Naenias, etc. by his
br^uity he becomes obscure: and whether he mean that the Sermo 15. de
Sanctis, attributed unto S. Augustine, were but counterset, seeing that feast
is not found mentioned in any very ancient writer, whether Greek or Latin, or
whether he mean that they were friuolously applied for aduantaging Peter's
jurisdiction over the other Apostles in the Romish manner, either of them he
might have intended, without contempt of the objected Fathers.
Danaeus justly called frivolous, returning it, as he does, Ergo laus ista non
ad Romanos, sed ad Antiochenos pertinet. Danaeus in the same place by them
cited: for the feast of the Chair of S. Peter at. Rome, is (in respect) but of
yesterdayes invention.
against themselves; thereby arguing that Antioch might challenge a privilege
above Rome, because in Calend. Romans Februarij 22.
Rome the festival solemnity of that chair of Antioch is celebrated unto
this day. We now end this point with

A conclusion arising from the premises of this Chapter, expressing the
security of the Protestants doctrine concerning the pretended Sovereignty and
jurisdiction of S. Peter.
SECT. 13.
30 In the due survey of the particulars of this question, we find our. 1. and
2.
Adversaries zealously advancing S. Peter's monarchical power, and transcendent
authority over all the Apostles of Christ and the whole Church of God, by the
virtue of one word Rock; but confuted by the express expositions of. 3.
Fathers, the strength of necessary. 5.
consequences, the feebleness of their own. 4.
answers, the direct. 7.
Analogy of Scriptures, and the ingenuous. 6.
confessions of their own Doctors: insomuch as that they may be thought in
stead of a Rock, to have built their foundation of Popedom upon the sands.

31 Their second endeavor has been as hapless, collecting a pre-eminence of
authority in Peter from only. 8.
titles of Head, Chief, Prince: which have been in. 8.
antiquity attributed unto other Apostles: who (by the. 9.
confession of our Adversaries) were equalled with S. Peter both in the power
of Order, and of Jurisdiction: according unto the evidence of. 9.
Scripture, reporting the promises made unto S. Peter, or the acts done by him.

32 Wherefore for their last strength they have been glad to lay hold upon the
weak support of a ceremonial feast: all which do fully ascertaine us of the
uncertainty of their claim, and embolden us to appeal unto any godly Reader
to judge between us, whether it be not less prejudicial unto Apostolic
function to esteem the Apostle S. Peter to have been in pastoral jurisdiction
only equal unto the rest (though for orders sake precedent,) then that all
the other Apostles should be subjected unto one. From Antioch we are
constrained to travel unto Rome.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the primacie of the Roman See: and first of the disposition
of Pope Leo in that claim.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
As concerning the Primacie of the Roman See, the Centurists say Centur. 5.
cap. 10. col. 1262 line 30.
Leo very painfully goes about to prove, that singular pre-eminence was given
to Peter above the Apostles, and that thence arose the Primacie of the Roman
Church: and Beza further says Confess. Geneuae, c. 7. sect. 12. and Whitaker
de Concilijs contra Bellarminum, page 37. paulo ante medium, says, De Leone
primo non laboro. magnus ille fuit Antichristiani regni architectus: and yet
ibidem page 34. circa medium, he says, of Leo, Fuit ille quidem doctus and
pius Episcopus, sed fuit tamen magis ambitiosus, etc.
It is manifest that Leo in his Epistles does clearly breath forth the
arrogance of the Antichristian Roman sea.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First showing that the Protestants in their censure
of Pope Leo, are not contradictorie unto themselves.
SECT. 1.
EXcept our Adversaries did think that Peter could beget a Pope, and that they
are able to translate his ancient chair of Antioch unto Rome, they would never
have so much busied themselves to prove either the prerogative of Peter's
person, or the honor of his See: yet may we not contemn their strength of
proving this, before that we have tried it. Now then

2 Doctor See their marginall note.
Whitaker is brought by the Apologists in their marginall notes, commending
Pope Leo for an holy man, and yet also condemning him as too ambitious. We
answer, as their Jesuit Maldonate has observed, that the Quaerunt quis little
mayor esset. Matthew 18. 1. 2. Non dub^^u^ est qum, eorum an (...) Christus
reprehenderit. -- In Ecclesia enim primum esse velle, caeter^l que praeesse, id
merito fuit tanqu^ ambitiosum reprehe^^^endu, etc. Ma. donat. Ies. comment. in
Matthew. 18.
disciples of Christ (among whom S. Peter was one) were reprehended by Christ
for affecting ambitiously to reign over others: Non hic agi de prima in
gubernanda Ecclesia dignitate, etsi eo etiam sensu hunc locum alicubi (epist.
53. ad Pulcheriam Augustam, de ambitu Anatolij) apud Leonem magnum legi memini.
Idem comment. in Marc. 9 34. See a so Iansen. Concord. in haec loca, Petrum
vnum fuisse.
which Pope Leo does interpret of that ambition, wherewith one desires to
have the supreme dignity in the governance of the Church. And will our
Adversaries deny, that S. Peter and other Apostles were holy men? If such were
the defect of the domestical attendants of our Savior, why may not those, who
are in respect but pilgrims from his presence, be subject unto the like
default without any prejudice unto their substantial faith, and other degrees
of holiness? Is not the Moon light, except it be at the full? or men not to
be called godly, except they be perfect? As for Pope Leo, he was so
peremptory, that for his presumption he found in his time some brotherly
checks: for

That pretended Jurisdiction, which Leo assumed, was crossed in his time, (and
consequently the taxation of Protestants justified,) in the proceedings of the
general Council of Calcedon, in the assembly of six hundred Bishops.
SECT. 2.
3 Our late Adversaries who collected this Council, do draw from thence (as
they think) fit arguments for the magnifying of the Papal authority, because

of the Romans, and not of the whole Church, which might implie an universal
jurisdiction. For in the same Council is repeated the judgment of the godly
Emperor Theodosius, who in the Council next before this, yielded the same
title of Primacy, yea and of authority also unto Dioscorus the Bishop of
Alexandria: for which cause he is taxed by a bold Romanist, of Theodosius dat

this Canon of the Council was afterward rejected by Pope Leo, because it
thought that the Roman See had her pre-eminence only from humane authority,
and not from the ordinance of God. This may be as a glass, wherein our reader
may perceive the right complexion of our Adversaries, and the antiquity of our
profession. They, to dignifie the Sea of Rome, had rather we should judge Conc.
Calcedon oecumenicum quattum, in quo sexcenti and triginta Episcopi interfuere.
Surius ex Ph^tio, Tom. 1. Council. page 3.
six hundred and thirty Bishops assembled in the fourth general Council, to
be sacrilegious, in detracting from the jurisdiction of a Pope, then to think
that Pope Leo might have been ambitious by not submitting his judgment unto
the authority of that Council.

5 Again, when we renounce that universal authority, which the Popes do now
challenge over the Church, and (which our Adversaries pretend to have descended
upon every Pope by the line of succession from Christ,) esteem it to be an
humane usurpation; we are by our Adversaries called Bellarm. lib. 4. de not is
Ecclesi^.
schismatics: notwithstanding that our assertion be herein justified by a
Council, so general, as consisting of more then six hundred Bishops; so
ancient, as being the fourth of all the Oecumenicals, even about Anno 440; and
so sincere and orthodoxall in the doctrine of faith, that De quatuor primis
Concilijs sic scribit Gregorius: Haec suscipere me and venerati fateor,
Nicaenum, -- Calcedonense denique, ^n quo Eutychetis, and Dioscori prauitas
reprobata est ^ haec tota deuotione amplector. Gratian. did. 15. C. Sicut.
S. Gregory professed that he did honor and embrace it.

6 Futhermore we may observe the strange disposition of our Adversaries who
still urge the authority of this Council for confirmation of the Papal title
of Vocat haec Synodus Leonem caput vniuersalis Ecclesiae, eumque nominat Patrem
Epi^^oporum omnium.] Admodum verisimile est nomen Oecumenici in titulo huius
Epistolae praefi^um quidem fuisse, sed ^ibrarij alicutus dolo hinc subtractum;
maxim quis Leo lib. 7. epist. 30. ad Eulogium Episcopum Alexandrinum scriben^,
ait: Vestra sanctitas nouit, quod per sanctam Calcedonensem Synodum vni
Pontifici sedis Apostolicae (cui nunc. Deo disponente, deseruio) hoc
vniuersalitatis nomen oblatum est. Binius annot, in hanc Synod. fol. 188.
the head of the universal Church: notwithstanding they confess the word
Universal not to be found inscribed in that Epistle of the Council: and are
therefore brought to conjecture, as of a thing not unlikely, that that
inscription by the fraud of some penman, was razed out. But why should this be
so much as surmised? because Leo (say they) in his Epistle does affirm, that
the Council of Calcedon did attribute unto him this title of universality. Thus
we see what our Adversaries only would prove, and now our discreet Reader may
judge, whether it be more likely that the Epistle of a Pope, or the Epistle of
an universal Council could be rather subject unto the fraudulent corruption
of a Scribe, especially after that he shall call to mind the protestation used
by S. Gregory, saying, See above, lib. 1. cap. 2.. 29. at the letter, b. in
margin.
Never any of my predecessors used this title of universal Bishop. We end this
point with a brief observation: to wit,

That the ambition of Pope Leo was humility, in respect of the usurpation of
his successors: by the judgment of their own learned Cardinal.
SECT. 3.
7 Cardinal Cusanus after other arguments brought for confirmation of his
conclusion, does insist upon the ancient examples of these Bishops of Rome,
viz. Gelasius, Leo, and Gregory: Ex quibus patet, quod sancti^ antiqui Roman
Pontifices non ita praesumebant de sua potestate* sed suerunt humiles, euam se
purgando coram Synodo sua, non vniuersalis Ecclesia* -- imo Leo Papa submittit
se omnibus poenis to legibus contenus Martiani, si non seruauerit contra suam
confirmationem, sicut scribit ipse ad Leonem Augustum de sua erga leges
consensione: si contra quit, me pumtionum conditionibus subdo, quas non solum
beatae memoriae Principis Martiani authoritas, sed etiam ego mea consensi^nt
firma^ti, Cardin. Cus^nus Concord. Eccles. lib. 2. cap. 20.
From these examples it may appear, (says he) that the Popes of ancient times
did not so much presume upon their authority, for they were humble: and did
purge themselves in their own Synods, yea and Leo submitted himself unto all
the punishments which were contained in the laws of the Emperor Martianus.
Neither yet do Protestants (who have been objected by the Apologists) make Leo
guilty of the now Romish ambition, which consists in usurpation of an
absolute power of making all Ecclesiastical laws, of creating all Patriarchs
and Church Officers, of receiving all Appeals, of determining all causes, of
deciding all matters of faith, of disposing of all temporal Crowns, and of
dispensing of Indulgences and Pardons: all which were almost as easily confuted
as propounded.

The Conclusion.
8 Knowing that Pope Leo was subject unto that ambition, which he. 1.
himself notes to have been in some of the holy Apostles: and that indeed he
was ambitious, except, to free him from that stain, we shall condemn the
Emperor Theodosius of. 1.
rashness, or. 2.
six hundred and thirty orthodoxall Bishops, of schismatic presumption;
and yet that Leo and his Predecessors did differ as much from his late
successors (which has been confessed) as humility differs from pride: we
cannot therefore but discern that the Apologists have been either too careful,
or else too careless what to object: and yet they continue still to be like
themselves, as will appear by their next oppositions.

THis next degree of time, wherein they insist, was about the year of Grace

were the Appeals allowed by the Council of Sardice, and whether there were

they had to promise in this place an auoidance of that objection. Their third
instance is

CHAP. XX. Of Pope Julius his claim of authority, in respect of a Council.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
M. Whitaker says also of Julius Bishop of Rome (who lived in Constantines
time,) that See Whitaker de Concilij^, etc. quaest. ^. page 42. sin. 43 initio,
and 44. paulo ante med.
he challenged to himself authority, that no Council should be celebrated
without the sentence of the Bishop of Rome.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
The state of the question.
SECT. 1.
TWo points would be observed in this pretended claim of Pope Julius; the
first is, what it was that he challenged; the second is, by what right. Both
these are recorded by Socrates. His challenge was, that he ought Julius
Episcopis, qui Antiochiae conuenerunt, per liter as respondet, ac docet eos
contra Eccles^ae Canone^ egisse, quod illum ad Concilium, non voc^ssent, quippe
cum Canon Ecclesiasticus vete^ ^e Decreta absque Romani Episcopi sententia
sanciantur. Socrates lib. 2. cap. 13.
to be called unto the Council, and that without his sentence no Decrees
should be concluded. The right hereof he pretends to stand upon the
authority of an Ecclesiastical Canon. Now the question is, how far this
challenge can make for the Primacie of the Sea of Rome. For the Apologists (we
know) have propounded this for the only scope of their present dispute:
therefore it belongs unto us to prove,

That the claim, which Pope Julius made, does nothing less then prove a
Papal Primacie of Jurisdiction: even by the confession of our learned
Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 The School of Romanists, and especially of Jesuits, hold the power of Esse
Pontificis congregare Synodum generalem, primo demonstrari potest a diuinis;
nam Concilium legitimum congregari non potest, nisi in non ine Christi^ Matthew.
18. 20. Quando duo aut tres congregantur in nomine meo. lbi, in nomine Christi,
nihil videtur esse aliud quim authoritate Christi congregari. hoc est, ab eo
qui a Christo habet congregandi authoritatem. Bellarm lib. 1. de Council. cap.
12.. ^sse autem.
calling a Council, to be the peculiar prerogative of the Pope; which they
contend to prove from Scripture, Matthew. 18. 20. When two or three are gathered
together in my name, I am in the midst: where the promise is general, as
well respecting congregations and assemblies of the faithful in prayer, as in
Councels. And shall not Christian men any day pray in the name of Christ unto
God, before they have the Popes real command, or assent? But (for we have
been constrained to digress) to return to the point.

3 They judge Est Concilium universal, quod ab universally Pastore Romano
Pontifice non indicitur, Concilij nomine indignum Gre^^r. Valent. Ies. Analys
fid. page 86. col. 2.. Primam.
no Council worthy the name of Occumenicall or universal, which is not
appointed by the Pope: when as yet they might be directed by their own
Doctors, first, that (as their Cardinal Cusanus, with others, witnesses)
Dicendum de viuersalis Ecclesiae Concilio, quod (...) authoritus non ita
dependet a congregante, quod nisi per Papam congregaretur, tunc non fieret
Concilium; quia tunc (...) fuissent octo prima Concilia omnia firma quoniam per
Imperatores congregabantur: and Romans Ponufex, ad instar alio^am Pat^^archarum,
Diuales sacr as iussiones pro veniendo, aut initrendo ad Concilia recepit.
Cusanus Cardin. Concord. Cathol. l^^ 2. cap. 25.
the authority of a Council does not depend upon the Pope, because so we
should disanull the authority of the eight first general Councels, which were
appointed by Emperors, when the Pope of Rome, as other Patriarchs, received by
letters missiue a public warning to come, or send unto the Councels.

4 And if Julius had been so neglected as not to receive due intelligence of
the indiction of a general Council, his challenge (by the virtue of ancient
Canons) might have been just, although not singular, but common with other
Patriarchs, who in the like case have made the like complaint. For how could
the Council be called general, or universal, whereunto the principal
members are not called? Because, Sicut quocunque, qui alioqui tenetur Synodis
interesse, and volenti, and potenti spreto, iudicium Synodi quia non recto
ordine charitatis processit, reprehendi posset, ita fortius in Capite. Ibid.
lib. 2. cap. 15. ante finem.
If any (says their Cardinal) be neglected whom it may concern to be
present, the judgment of that Synod deserves reprehension; how much more if
the Pope be excluded? which we also allow. But from a case so common with
others, it is a fallacy called (...), to conclude an absolute and singular
Primacie of any one. So again,

Their former argument for the Popes Primacie is confuted by the confessed
proceedings of a Council.
SECT. 3.
5 Hoc probat textus Council. octaui, quia expectati fuerunt Vicarij senior.
Romae, and amplius expectare non sit iustum: incongruum omnino puramus
despicere fluctuintem Christi Saluatoris Ecclesiam per dilationum

Cae^a^eae Cappadociae dixit, remorari nos in hac ciuitate multam laesionem

igitur common^^ recusauerint conuenire nobiscum -- arbitror non esse
necessariam dilationem, si placet Synodo, etc. Cusan. ibid. l. 2 c. 2.
Their Cardinal grants, that in the second general Council of Ephesus,
when the Legates of Pope Leo, to wit, Julius and Hilarious had warning to come
unto the Synod, but by delays refused to be there; then Talasius Bishop of
Cappadocia, moved this Council not to expect them any longer, but
notwithstanding their absence to proceed. Here we find a general Council,
wherein the Pope was not present, either by himself, or by any of his Legates.

6 Nay, the Bishops of Rome were in those times so impotent and unable to
gather any Oecumenicall or general Council, that it is by them observed out
of ancient monuments, that Pope Leo with his Prouincial Council was glad to
entreat license of the godly Emperor Leo Papa ad Theodosium Augustum:
Concilium universal intra Italiam, sicut Synodus quae ob hanc causam Romae
conuenerat mecum petit, Clementia vestra concedat. Haec ibi. Ecce vniuersalem
Synodum per Synodum, vbi Papa praesidet, ab Imperatore intra Italiam petitam.
Cardin. Cusanus Concord. lib. 2. cap. 7.
Theodosius, that they might celebrate a general Council in Italy. Which
argues that the now pretended Romish primacie had not his Christendom in the
days of Pope Julius, as their own arguments in other Sections will fully
prove: after that we have shown

That the now Romanists, in defending the Primacie of the Popes in general
Councels, have discovered their notorious pride and ambition: proved by the
assertions of our Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
7 As they hold it necessary that Popes should be made acquainted with the
celebration of every general Council; (for how else could it have been
called universal?) so ought they to think it, at least requisite, that the
same Popes should be personally present in some one general Council, or else
show us some sensible reason of their absence. Their Cardinal for excuse of
their personal absence from the first seven general Councels, has
coniectured two special reasons, which may not be pretermitted.

8 First, Ego suspicor duas fuisse causas quare Papa non Concilijs generalibus
personaliter affuit: prima, quia non videbatur conuenire vt caput sequeretur
membra, cum potius membra ^equi debent caput. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Romans Pont.
cap. 19.. Ego suspicor.
because it seemed unto the ancient Popes (says he) a thing inconvenient, that
the head (for so was the Pope) should follow the members. Of what spirit this
may savor of, their old preacher Ferus will signify: Membrum est vnum altero
nobilius, nihilominus tamen omnibus est commune quod sunt membra vnius
corporis^ in hoc vnum non praestat alij, vnum alteri non inuidet, nec inferius
contemnit. Sic in Ecclesia quodlibet membrum sua operatione alijs inseruit.
Ferus comm in Act. 8.
Although (says he) one member be more excellent then another, yet this is
common unto all, that every one is a member to the same body: neither does one
either disdain or envy the good of another, but every one will be serviceable
to strengthen another. And could any such disdainful Pope (if yet there had
been any such) deserve the title of Pontifex qui Seruus seruorum Dei se
nominat. Bellar. lib. 3. de Laicis, cap. 7.. Ex.
Servant of the servants of God?

9 Altera ratio, quia in Concilijs Orientalibus, vbi semper suit Imperator,
Graeci Imperatorem in summo loco collocabant. Ergo ad vitand^m tumultum ipse
non ibat, sed tantum Legatos mittebat. Bellar. lib. 1. de Concilijs, ca^. 19.
Altera ratio.
The second cause was (says their Cardinal) for that in the East Churches,
and Councels, the Emperor was placed in the highest seat; therefore the Popes
(lest they might be occasion of tumult) would not go themselves, but sent their
Legates. This reason seems to be a feather of the same wing of pride, which
was condemned by our Savior, who (as their own Cum dixit Christus [Vae vobis,
qui diligitis primas cathedras] ibi non res ipsas, sed affectus damnabat.
Iansenius Concord in cum locum. Qui minor est (inquit Christus, Luc. 9.) mayor
est: quia quanto quis humilior, tanto Christo similior. Ergo inter vos
spirituales, non debet esse contentio de primo loco, sed de postremo: hinc
Christus, Discite a me, quia humilis sum. Stella in Luc. 9.
Doctors note) cried woe against them who loved the chiefest chaires: when
laboring to compound a strife which arose among his Disciples, contending who
should be the chief, he said, that he who was the least, was the greatest;
teaching thereby, says their Stella, that whosoever are spiritually minded,
should not contend for the uppermost, but for the lowest rooms.

10 Not but that there ought to be a respect had of the persons of men, but
that (if the case had so stood, as our Adversaries observe, when as yet the
Emperors were most religious) we are advised to consider, concerning the
Council. Nicaenum, in quo trecenti december and octo diuini Episcopi. Surius Tom.

three hundred and eighteen Bishops who were assembled in the first general
Council of Nice, and an hundred and fifty in the second general Council of
Constantinople, and two hundred at the third general Council at Ephesus, and
six hundred and thirty Bishops in the fourth general Council at Calcedon,
and one hundred sixty five at the second general Council at Constantinople (
Cunctas personas (inquit Gregorius Papa) quas praefata quin que Concilia

which five first and most famous Councels were honored by S. Gregory, he
pronouncing Anathema upon every one that does not embrace them) that they were
the most happy vanquishers of the most desperate heretics that ever wounded
our head Christ. Whether now are we rather to think, that a thousand four
hundred sixty and three orthodoxall Bishops could have been so injurious, or
some few Popes so ambitious; which is our present theme? And who sees not,
by their Cardinals answer, that for the space of the first five hundred years,
and in purest times of the Church, it was held as a Catholic truth, to
prefer in place an Emperor before a Pope. But we return unto their pretense
of Papal authority in the Council, and give

Diverse plain demonstrations, that the now Romish profession of Papal
Primacie, concerning the ordering of a general Council, is a flat Apostate
from the integrity of former times in many necessary points: even by the
confessions of our learned Adversaries.
The first two are against their presumed absolute sufficiency in the Pope
alone without a Council, and his authority to command it.
SECT. 5.
11 That this mystery may be more clearly displaied, we will use the light of
method, reducing all the points of their pretended Primacy, for order sake,
unto these five prepositions, 1. without, 2. before, 3. in, 4. after, and 5.
above a Council.

12 Without the help of a Council the sole authority of the Pope is by them
defended, to be sufficient to Pontifex Romanus est Iudex legitimus
controuersiarum omnium, quae possunt oriri in negotio religionis, etiam cum
sine Concilio aliquid definiat. Gretzerus Ies^in Colloq. Ratisb Sess. 1.

untruly) by experience; hereby (as any may perceive) to prefer the authority
of one man before the judgment of the whole Church. Against which kind of
spiritual By a kind of a Pythagorean (...).
monopolizing we may but only demand (as their Doctor does from experience,)
Quid opus est Concilijs, quorsum tot sumptus, -- quorsum ^ot Theologi
accersuntur, quorsum attinet tot Academias in tractandis negotijs distorqueri,
cum ex vno Pontifice quid verum sit audi^e liceat? Erasmus annot. in 1. Cor. 7.
What necessarte use could there be of Councels? what need of so great charge
and travel about them? to what end is it to trouble so many Divines and
Universities for discussing of doubts, if we might be satisfied by the only
judgment and determination of the Pope? For thus should they have no necessary
reason to allege that Scripture, [ Matthew. 18. 20. See it objected above.
when two or three are gathered together, etc.] for gathering of a Council.
The second proposition follows.

13 Before that our Adversaries will acknowledge any Council to be truly
called, they hold it necessary that the Pope do authorize it; which we have
heard affirmed by See above. 2.
Jesuits, and confuted by their own See above. 2.
Doctors, as derogatory from the true tenor of purest antiquity. Next is

The third Demonstration, unfolding four new and notable deformities, and
especially a Romish spiritual tyranny, and a presumption Anabaptisticall,
concerning the Popes behavior in a Council.
SECT. 6.
14 In the Synod, when it is called and assembled, we may perceive many Romish
aberrations and reuolts from true antiquity. The first is in making their Pope
the necessary Generale Concilium est, in quo nemo recte praesidet, nisi summus
Pontifex, aut alius eius nomine. Bellar. lib. 1. de Council. cap. 4.
president of all general Councels, either by himself, or by his delegate:
especially seeing they believe that the Etsi Legati sint nomine Pontificis,
tamen -- non habent priuilegiu^ non errandi, quod habet Pontifex. Bellarm. lib.
2. de Council. cap. 11.. Praeterea.
Legates of the Pope have not the same privilege of not erring, which the Pope
has in himself: for this seems to imply a great incongruity, if not impiety,
that the Pope (when he might be at any general Synod) should send his Legate,
and to absent himself. As for example, in the last Council of Trent, which
continued the space of fifteen years, wherein no one Tridentinum Concilium
habuit Praesides vice summi Po^tisicis tres Legatos Papae -- sub Paulo tertio,
Iulio 3. Pio 4. Vega lib. 1. de Iustif. cap. 5.
Pope appeared in his own person: shall we allow them to answer for this last
Council, as they have done for the seven first, viz. It is not meet that the
Pope, the head, should follow the body? as though it were meet the head
should be distracted from the body.

15 Nay, but if (as they say truly) the Concilium Apostolorum primum fuit, a
quo formam acceperunt alia omnia Concilia. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Council cap. 2.
Council of the Apostles Act. 15. should be a president and form of all
orthodoxall Councels, and that also S. Peter (unto whom their Pope will be
thought to succeed) In Act. 15. Petrus fuit in Concilio primo. Idem, lib. 3. de
verbo Dei, cap. 5.. Sextum argumentum.
was personally present in that Council: then are their now Popes defective in
this point, who by their absence make their own body, that is, the Church
Acephalon or headless.

16 Secondly, Protestants requirunt in Concilio, vt liberum sit Theologos non
minus quim Episcopos voces decisiuas proferre in Concilijs.
in a Synod Protestants require, that it may be free as well for Priests and
learned Divines, as for Bishops to have definitive voices: this by the now
Romish doctrine is denied, as being Respondeo, hoc esse contra formam Concilij.
Bellarm. lib. 1. de Council. cap. 21.
contrary unto the form of a Council. And in behalf of their Bishops, who
for want of learning, may be thought incompetent Judges of the mysteries of
faith: their Cardinal Bellarmine answers, that Respondeo, Episcopos habere
authoritatem iudicandi, non quia doctr^unt, sed quia sunt personae publicae.
Bellarm. lib. 1. de Council. cap. 16.
Bishops have authority of judging in Synods, not as they are learned, but as
they are public persons; as if their ignorance could not prejudice their
judgment. But their Cardinal Arelatensis has long since confuted this, by the
practice of the foresaid Apostolical Synod: which our Adversaries have
acknowledged to be the platform of all other orthodoxall Councels; In Act. 15.
Visum est nobis.] Vox [nobis] refertur ad illud quod praecessit, vbi nominantur
Apostoli and seniores: and verbum [Visum est] non consultationem sed decisionem
significat. Quid prohibet Concilium Apostolicum i^^tari? In Concilio Nicaeno
Athanasius Presbyter fere solus argumentationes Arianorum disturbabat: etiam in
Constantiensi Synodo, and in Pisana, and in amphssima ^ateranensi Presbyteros
iudicasse vna cum Episcopis non est ambiguum. Card. Arelatensis in Council.
Basil. vt resert Aenaeas Sylutus de gesis Council. Basil.
Therein James (says he) said [It seems good unto us:] where the persons
signified by the pronoune [vs] are noted in the text to have been not only
Apostles, but also Seniors, or Presbyters: and the word [seemeth good] does
show, that it was their desinitiue sentence. Afterward he manifests by the
example of the first Council of Nice, and the late Romish Councels of
Constance and Laterane, that other learned presbyters, besides Bishops, had
judicial voices in Synods.

17 Finally, their preacher Stella displaying the ignorance of many Bishops who
were called at the Council of Trent, and carried with them other learned
Divines, by whom they might be illuminated, says, that he could Hi Episcopi
secum ducunt doctos Theologos, qui ipsos illuminent, vt in nostro Trident.
Concilio nostris temporibus contigit. In hac quidem re non possum mihi a risu
temperare: melius quidem Episcopi facerent, si Epi^copatus suos Theologis
renunciarent. De his vera est Domini sententia, [Si caecus caecum.] Stella in
Luc. cap. 6. in illa verba: Si caecus caecum.
not contain laughter at the sight of that deformity; and therefore held it
better that those Bishops should resign their Bishoprics unto the learned
Divines, because in these Bishops (says he) is verisied the saying of our
Sautour; If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch: and
consequently their former reason must be thought to depend but only upon a
blind distinction.

18 Thirdly, in a Council we know, and they confess, Non est numerus in
Concilio adeo necessarius sicut libertas and vnanimitas. Cardin. C^sanus, lib.
2. de Concord. Cathol cap. 3.
the number is not more necessary then the liberty and unanimity of their
suffrages and voices. Now they ascribe this prerogative unto the Pope, Pontifex
mittere solet Legatos instructos de sententia Apostolicae sedis cum ea
condition, vt si Concilium consentiat cum indicio Apostolicae sedis, formetur
Decretum: si minus, differatur decreti formatio done Romanus Pontifex
respondeat. Bellar. lib. 2. de Conc. cap. 11.. Quod.
to send his Legates to the Council, but with the instructions and directions
of the Apostolic See: so that, if the Council will consent unto the judgment
of the Sea Apostolic, they may then form and frame a Decree: otherwise the
matter must be deferred until they should understand the pleasure of his
Holiness. The reason why they would tie the Council unto the Popes
predetermination is, because Aliquando Legati mittuntur ad Concilium cum
instructione sedis Apostolicae: -- Si Patres consentiant ac definiant
dissentientibus Legatis, errare possunt, sicut contigit in Conc. Ephesino 2.
if that the Fathers of the Council (say they) or the Legates themselves shall
judge contrary unto their instructions, they may err.

19 They produce for example in the first kind, the second Council of Ephesus;
in the second sort, a Council of Constantinople: and finally set it down for
a conclusion, that Secundo si Concilia consenserint Legatis contra
instructionem Pontificis agentibus, dici non possunt legitima, quia pugnant cum
capite, and sic errauit Constantinopolitanum Concilium, tempore Nicolai primi.
Bellar lib. 2. de Conc. cap. 11. per integrum cap.
the Councels, if they consent against the Popes instructions, they are not to
be acknowledged as lawful, because they are divided from the head. This is
that which we have named a spiritual tyranny, and indeed a very stifling of
that liberty, which was always the very natural and vital breath of a
lawful Council: but when their Judges like mil-horses are thus blinded with
prejudice, it is no marvel though their Cardinal In condendis statutis

Concord, Cathol. lib. 2. cap. 12.
Cusanus held such voicers to be no Judges, but only Counselors, and called
the defenders of the forenamed authority of their Pope, slatterers: and that
justly, as has been proved by the ancient Councels of Sieve Pontifex in
definiendo studium adhibeat, sieve non adhibeat, modo tamen controuersiam
definiat, infallibiliter certe definiet: atque adeo re ipsa vtitur authoritate

Ephesus, Constantinople, and Calcedon, which have neglected the Popes
instructions.

20 Lastly, in a general Council, he that shall claim the power of
pronouncing a definitive sentence, ought to perform great diligence for
disquisition of the truth. Yet do their Jesuits so much adore their Pope, as to
make him an immediate Oracle of truth: for q if the Pope (says he) do
determine any controversy, his definition and judgment is infallible, whether,
to that end, he use any diligence, or not. This is an Anabaptisticall
Enthusiasmus, as (if occasion permit) shall be showed in due place.

21 For this present we oppose the judgment of Ferus (whom our Adversaries
recko^ among the Sea in the Catalogue before this Book, at the name Ferus.
Preachers notably learned in the book of God,) who observing the passages of
the Apostolical Council at Jerusalem, mentioned Act. 15: In Act. 15. Cum
magna conquisitio facta est] Vide quam prudenter agunt; non praecipitant
sententiam, sed singula expendunt in rebus fidei; non satis est dicere, Volumus
and mandamus. Quid mirum si in hoc Concilio fuerit Spiritus sanctus? Nos autem
aliter conuenimus, nobis pollicentes quiduis nobis licere de plenitudine

Mark (says he) how wisely they deal, they do not rashly give sentence, but
examine every thing: It is not sufficient for us to say, [we will and
command.] What marvel therefore is it if the spirit of God were in this
Council? But our meeting is now otherwise, by promising unto our selves a
license to do any thing [vpon the fullness of authority:] and how can the
spirit of God allow of such kind of assemblies? Now follow

The two last Demonstrations, especially that which aduanceth the Pope above a
Council: confessed by our Adversaries themselves.

Primacic indeed, but their learned Cardinal says, that this claim is Non

the consent of a Synod, he has not so much as an absolute negative voice.

the Pope of Rome is absolutely above any general Council: so that he does not
acknowledge any judgment above him, being not subject unto any power on earth,
whether civil or ecclesiastical, no not unto all the Bishops of the Church
assembled together in a Council. But this is that doctrine which their own

approve. By which it appears, how fa^^e the Church of Rome is departed not
only from the Catholic doctrine of the Greek Church, but even from her own
late commendable practice. We add,

Our Conclusion.
SECT. 8.
24 We are now at leisure to reckon the gain which our Adversaries have got by
obiecting unto Protestants the practice of. 1.
Pope Julius: from whence they have. 2.
impertinently concluded the Popes Primacie in the ordering of Councels, and by
the opposition of a general Council, wherein the fame Julius was Legate, have
found an evident proof of the Popes. 3. and 4.
subjection: and whereas they undertake to defend the now Papal Jurisdiction in
respect of the ordering of a general Council, they have bewraied manifold
Romish reuolts from primitive antiquity. First,. 5.
they teach that the Popes sole authority is, in it self sufficient, without
the help of a Council, to direct the Church infallibly in all necessary
truth: which assertion is. 5.
confessed to impugn the wisdom of all ancient Churches, and makes all
Councels to have been, in effect, superfluous.

25 Secondly, if the Council must be gathered, then do they, 2.
appropriate the power thereof unto the Pope, which claim is. 2.
confessed to be contrary unto the ancient practice of the Church in the
calling of general Councels.

26 Thirdly, when a Council is called, the Popes ordinary want of pres^nce in
Councels, wherein he claims a presidence, is. 6.
confessed to contradict the practice of the first Council Apostolical. His
allowing of Bishops only to have. 6.
definitive voices in a Council, is. 6.
confessed to decline from the common use of Councels, even of later times. His
preinstructions, wherewith he preoccupateth his Bishops, and limiteth them what
they shall say, does turn iudicium into praeiudicium, and is confessed to
overthrow the ancient liberty of their voices, wherein consists the life and
soul of a Council. His presumption of a power of judging without diligent
inquisition of the truth, and his peremptory conclusion by will and command,
are. 6.
confessed to be condemned by the Apostles practice, in their first Council at
Jerusalem.

27 Fourthly, after that the Council has enacted Decrees, the Popes pretended
power of dissoluing them, is. 7.
confessed to be false, and repugnant unto the profession of ancient Popes.

28 Lastly, his now proclaimed jurisdiction above a Council, is. 7.
confessed to be but flattery, even by their own Doctors, who notwithstanding
profess the defense of the Papal Primacie by all their power. Such is the now
Romish challenge by them who would make the Pope, as it were a and o in the
judgment of the Church, and in pretense of ancient proofs overthrow the
confessed form and profession of all antiquity.

CHAP. XXI. Of S. Cyprian his judgment concerning the Pope, and Church of Rome.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
S. Cyprian though a Bishop of Afric (who lived Anno 240.) is charged by the
Century writers for his affirming Centur. 3. c. 4. col. 84. line 44.
our chair founded by our Lords voice upon the Rock: and that Ibid. l. 49.
there ought to be one Bishop in the CATHOLIC Church: and for his challenge
Ibid. l. 56.
Peter's chair the principal Church from whence priestly unity arises: and
lastly, for his (say they) Ibid. l. 51.
teaching without any foundation of Scripture, that the Roman Church ought to
be acknowledged of all others, for the Mother and Root of the Catholic Church.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First, showing the importunity of our Adversaries, in
insisting upon this testimony of S. Cyprian, unto whom we do as willingly
appeal.
SECT. 1.
FRom Pope Julius they are ascended an hundred years nearer the rising of the
Sun of righteousness, Christ our Lord, even unto the age of S. Cyprian the
glorious Martyr of Christ. Neither do we find in all the writings of our
Adversaries any Father more generally noted, for proof of any point of Romish
doctrine, then S. Cyprian is for the defense of the Popes Primacy: nor yet in
Cyprian any one testimony more vehemently urged, almost in all their disputes,
then are these now alleged, which the Romanists do so confidently press, as
though in them they had displaied the ensigns of victory. Hereunto therefore
must we address our answer, requesting our Adversaries, that (casting away all
preoccupation of personal and partial respects) they would be contented to
stand unto this so honorable a witness, who has testified a glorious
profession of the name of Christ, and sealed the truth thereof with his blood,
which was shed by the hands of Infidels: and whose judgment we shall willingly
admit as an vmpier in this controversy. And to this purpose we deliver

A satisfaction to the objected exceptions, taken by Protest^nts unto some
words of S. Cyprian.
SECT. 2.
2 S. Cyprian, indeed, uses such phrases of Cyprian lib. 1. epist. 3. and lib.
2. epist. 10. ad Cornelium, dicit, Non aliunde haereses nata^, nisi quod
Sacerdoti Dei non obt^mperatur, nec vnus in Ecclesia Iudex vice Christi
cogitetur. Ergo, etc. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Romans Pont. ca. 12 and 16. Costerus
Ies. Enchirid. Turrian. contra Sadael. Duraus contra Whitakerum.
one Bishop, but so, as it may appear by himself, that by one Bishop he
understands not one, to be universal, but generally every Bishop in his
distinct Dioces, calling the government of the whole Church Episcopatus vnus
est, cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur. Cyprian. lib 4. epist. 9. Omnes
Episcopi sunt vnus Episcoparus: quilibet Episcopus vice Christi ad tempus
Iudex. Cyprian. ibid. And, Vnde haereses, nisi quia vnus Episcopus, qui
Ecclesiae praeest, superba quorunda^ praesumptione contemnitur? Which Cyprian
speaks of himself to Papianus, who delivered disgraceful reports against
him. So lib 1. epist. 3.
one Bishopric, wherein every Bishop as a Vicar of Christ, has equally a
full portion, bound to yield account unto God for it.

3 And although the next sentences of S. Cyprian may seem, at their first
view, unto the inexpert Reader, to observe in the Church of Rome both a grace
of Ecclesia super Petrum fundata: aliud altar constitui non potest. Et,
Schismanci isti, (inquit) Petri Cathedram atque Ecclesiam principalem, vnde
(...) Sacerdotalis exorta est, non recipient; nec cogitant cos esse Romanos,
ad quos pe^fidia non potest habere accestum. Cyprian. vt refert Bellarm. lib.
4. de Eccles. milit. cap. 10.
impossibility of erring, and also a prerogative of the According to the words
alleged by the Apologists.
Mother Church of all others, and are therefore censured by our Centurists for
speeches inconvenient. yet no man, exercised and conversant in his writings,
and other Fathers, can be ignorant, that such like speeches are but the
languages of Rhetorical amplification, which commonly they use by way of
persuasion rather then of asseueration.

4 So now when five Nouatian and heretical Bishops had created a schismatic
Bishop in Carthage, who to gain favor at Rome, did there falsely boast, that he
had been ordained by 25. Bishops of Afric: S. Cyprian (to give the Bishop of
Rome a caution, lest peradventure he might be deceived with lies) does write
unto him, putting him in mind of the commendations which S. Paul once gave of
the Romans, not so much to show what a kind of Bishop he was, as to intimate
what he should be. For S. Cyprian, even in the very same case whereof he wrote,
did greatly complain, that Basilides post crimina detecta Romam pergens,
Stephaoum collegam nostrum long positum fefell^^ Cyprian. epist 68. ad Clerum
and plebem in Hispania. And epist. 55. Mendacia non diu fallunt. Concerning the
same point.
Stephen the Bishop of Rome suffered himself to be deceived by Basilides:
noting him of an error in defense of a cause Quae mihi ad literas nostras
Stephanus frater noster rescripser^t, misi tibi rescripti exemplum, quo lecto
magis ac magis eius errorem denotabis, qui haereticorum causam contra
Christianos, and contra Ecclesiam Dei asse^ere conatur. Cypr. epist. 74 ^este
vel Card. Bar^ni^, anno 258. number. 37.
against the Church of God. Again the same commendatio^ of the Romans given
by S. Paul, the In these points of faith, and in all others, the commendations
which S. Paul gives unto the Church of Rome, is much to be noted, saying,
[Your faith is renouned in the whole world, and your obedience is published in
every place.] The translators of the Rh^mish Testament in the Argument before
the Epistle, at the end thereof.
Rhemists wish may be much noted; intimating therein the singularity of their
faith: whereas notwithstanding their Cardinal Tolet from the same Chapter
teaches his Reader contrariwise, to Perpende Euangelij indifferentiam; quamuis
enim Romani inter caeter ^^ Gentes eminerent, and primatum tenerent, tamen in
praedicatione Euangelij, and in salutis negotio pares eos facit: cum (...) Romans

Ies. com. in hunc locum.
observe the indifferency of the Gospel, in saying [vers. 13. That I may
receive some fruit of you, as I do of other Gentiles:] Thereby other Churches
of the Gentiles were, concerning the business of salvation, equal with the
Romans, notwithstanding that the Romans did otherwise excel all others. We
return unto Saint Cyprian, and prove our former answer to be true, yielding

Diverse plain Demonstrations, whereby is proved, that S. Cyprian was an
absolute adversary both unto Stephen Bishop of Rome, and his Chair; by the
testimonies of our learned Adversaries.
The first is concerning the title of Universal Bishop.
SECT. 3.
5 The title of Universal Bishop of the Church, has been long used of the
Pope of Rome, and is assumed at this day by the Romanists for the peculiar
character and ensign of his primacie; notwithstanding that S. Gregory long
since did both disclaim and detest it, as has been See confessed above, lib.
1. c^p. 2.. 29.
showed. But what of S. Cyprian, who was about 300 years ancient unto S.
Gregory? Neque quisquam nostru^m se Episcopum Episcoporum vocat. Cyprian.
epist. ad Quintum.
None of us (says he) is called the Bishop of Bishops: which not Cyprian
only, but (as our Adversary Surius shows) Concilium Carthaginense sub
Cypriano Episcopo. In principio, Neque quisquam nostrum Episcopu^ se
Episcoporum constituit, aut tyrannico terrore ad obsequendi necessitatem
collegas suos adigit, quando habet omnis Episcopus, pro licentia libertatis and
potestatis suae, arbitrium proprium, tanquam iudicari ab alio non possit, cum
nec ipse possit alterum iudicare: sed expectemus vniuersi iudicium Domini
nostri Jesus Christi, qui solus habet potestatem de actu nostro indicandi. Apud
Surium Tom. 1. Conc. in Conc. Carthag. page 242.
the whole Council of Carthage under Cyprian did profess: furthermore calling
it a terror tyrannical for any one Bishop to impose upon his fellow Bishops a
necessity of obedience. Which Canon now specified, was especially and
purposely intended against the Bishop of Rome: for (as their own last, and
most authorized Binius plainly testifies) Alludit ad Decretum Stephani Papae,
qui aliter sentientibus poenam excommunicationis comminatus est. (...) cod.
Tom. an^^t. in cum locum
this Council, in this speech, did allude unto the Decree of Pope Stephen, who
then denounced excommunication against such as were opposite unto his
judgment. Whereby it is clear, that S. Cyprian, together with all the Bishops
of that Council, by denying the Pope of Rome the title of Universal Bishop of
the Church, did equally abandon all pretense of his now usurped universal
jurisdiction over the Church. And this may be truly called our first
Demonstration.

The second Demonstration, from S. Cyprian his opposition unto the Popes
Chair, in the case of Appeals.
SECT. 4.
6 The right of appealing unto the Bishop of Rome from all the coasts of the
world, is urged by their Cardinal Bellarmine as a special Argumentum nonu^ ex
eo p^ti potest, quod ex quauis part orbis Christian^ ad Romanum Pontificem
legitime prouocatur. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Romans Pont. cap. 21. in initio.
argument of the Popes absolute Primacie: notwithstanding S. Cyprian directly
ordained in a Council, that every man's cause should be heard there, where it
was committed: and therefore commanded those men to return home again unto
Carthage, who had adventured to appeal unto Rome, not allowing that any other
Bishops should retract things done by them in Afric, unless (says Cyprian)
a few le^d and desperate persons think the Bishops of Afric to have f
Statutum est omnibus nobis, etc. Cyprian. epist. 55. ad Cornelium. I am causa
eorum cognita est, sciunt quo reuertantur, nisi paucis desperatis minor videtur
authorita^ Episcopor^^ in Africa constitutorum. Cyprtan. ibid. and lib. 1.
epist 4. n^teth Stephen, Deificam disciplinam neglige^^* for admitting of the
Appeal of Basilides and Martial: and applies against Stephen that of the
Psalmist, Tu odisti disciplinam, and proiecisti sermone^ meo^ post te: videb as
furem, and fimul curreb^s cum eo.
less authority, by whom they have been already judged and condemned. And
after chec^^eth the Bishop of Rome and his counselors for giving
entertainment to such extrauagants, censuring him in the words of the
Psalmist, Thou ha^t hated discipline, and cast my words behind thee: thou see
a thief, and consentest unto him, etc. Thus has S. Cyprian showed his
opposition unto one of the greatest prerogatives that the Pope challenges at
this day, viz. the Appealing unto his See. And this must needs demonstrate the
aduersnesse which S. Cyprian had against the now Romish Primacie, as will be
better confirmed by

A third Demonstration of S. Cyprians judgment, by opposing himself unto the
high chair of the Pope, even unto a Roman Council; is it is confessed by our
Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
8 Whether by S. Peter's chair our Adversaries will have us to understand the
Popes sole and peremptory command, or else his ordinance by assent of his
Consistorians and Cardinals, or else his Decree in a Council; S. Cyprian is
the same Cyprian still. And although our Romish Adversaries who otherwise seek
by the authority of Cyprian to erect the Papal throne, and to prove, that
Subesse Romano Pontifici est de necessitate salutis, Cuius iudicium est regula
veritatis. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Eccles milit. cap. 2. and 5. Lindan. Panopl. l.

21. ^um. 2.
to be subject unto the Bishop of Rome, is necessary unto salvation; yet
concerning this Father, Cardinal Bellarmine and Binius confess, that Stephano
Papae Cyprianus serio praecipienti parere nolu^^, sed verba contume^osa contra
Pontificem prot^. lit. Bellarm. lib. 4. de Romans Pont cap. 7. Ft, Romano

3. vbi Cyprianus (postquam Stephanus eorum acta de causa rebaptizandi
reprobaslet) numero Episcoporum 87. ex Africa and Numidia congregato Concilium
aliud celebrauit, vbi Stephanum tacito nomine suggillabat. Binius Tom. 1.
Annot. in Act. h^^us Conc.
Cyprian opposed himself in a Council of fourscore and seven Bishops against
the Pope, defining contrariwise in another Council: and besides did
contum^ltously revile the Bishop of Rome, being himself afterward crowned a
faithful Martyr: although he were Vt Cyprianum Stephanus a communione sua quod
in ipso erat, repelleret, -- and praeciperet vniuersae fra^e^^^tati, ne quis
eius Legatos in domum reciperet. Cassander lib. Consult. art. 7.
dented communion by the Pope, and yet was Nec tamen eius retractatio vnquam
in^enitur. Bellar. lib. ^. de Conc. cap. 5.
never known to have recanted.

9 Can any then surmise that S. Cyprian did judge the chair of Rome, and the
Bishop thereof absolutely infallible, when he himself set his Council against
the Council of Rome? or that he could believe the Roman See to be the only
Catholic Mother, who feared not to die out of her communion? This we take to
be an infallible demonstration of Cyprians judgment, to teach us that the now
chair of Rome is of such a new frame and fashion, as which S. Cyprian would
never have approved. We furthermore insist in

A fourth Demonstration of S. Cyprian his doctrine, concerning the Mother
Church.
SECT. 6.
10 That the eclipse of judgment in our Adversaries, may yet more visibly
appear, we approach yet nearer to the Motherhood of their Church.

11 We find one sentence of S. Cyprian much magnified by our Aduer saries, and
in the mouth of almost every Nouice, to wit, Non habet Deum patrem, (inquit
Cyprianus) qui non habet Ecclesiam matrem. Costerus Ies. Apolog. part. 3.
No man can have God to his Father, who has not the Church to his mother.
Hence they labor to prove the Church of Rome to be the absolute and only
Catholic Mother, without which there is no salvation. Who would not now think
that the Romanists, as often as they urge this sentence, did believe it to have
been spoken by S. Cyprian, in behalf of the Church of Rome? But this is their
boldness, for the same sentence is by S. Cyprian purposely applied against
that cause which Stephen the then Pope of Rome urged; who is confessed to have
Cyprianus cum Stephanus a sua communione eum repelleret, and Episcopos ab illo
ex Africa legatos, nec ad sermon communis colloquij admitteret, and
praeciperet vniuersae fraternitati, ne quis ^os in domum suam reciperet, sed
and tectum and hospitium negaretur. Cyprianum quoque pseudochristum, and
dolosum operarium diceret. Cassander Consult. art. 7.
denied Cyprian his communion, and to have forbidden that any should so much as
receive his messengers into house, or Inn: the which Pope, Cyprian, in the
words immediately following the alleged sentence, does accuse of Cum natiuitas
Christianorum in baptismo sit, baptismi autem regeneratio and sanctificatio
apud solam sponsam Christi sit, quae parere spiritualiter and generare filios
Deo possiti vbi, and ex qua, and cui natus est, qui filius Ecclsiae non est? Vt
habere quis possit Deum patrem ante Ecclesiam matrem? Cum vero nulla omnino
haeresis, neque aliquod schisma habere salutaris baptismi sanctificationem
foris possit, cut in tantum Stephani fratris nostri obstinatio dura prorupit?
etc. Cyprian. Epist. ad Pompeium, page 329.
obstinacy. See at last

Our Conclusion.
SECT. 7.
12 Now then let our Apologists deliberate how they will answer their own
objection retorted upon them: S. Cyprian Bishop of Carthage, who lived 240
years after Christ, did himself (as we have proved) together with four score
and eight Bishops of Afric and Numidia, deny the Popes See above. 3.
title of Universal Bishop; yielding no other title unto Pope Cornelius then

Appeals, and opposing a Council against his. 5.
Council; dying out of the Popes. 5. and 6.
communion (but yet not out of the unity of the Catholic Church) and in the
honor of Martyrdom.

12 This, we think, might work in our Adversaries, at least, a blush, and
teach them to forbear to assume S. Cyprian for a Patron of the Roman Primacy,
Chair, and Motherhood: except they would intend to prove concerning S.
Cyprian, that the same man of God and holy Martyr of Christ, was neither Saint
nor Martyr, but (because an Adversary unto the Popes Decree) undoubtedly a
damnable schismatike. After him they speak

exercising jurisdiction upon former Churches.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By an historical relation of the Acts of Pope
Victor, containing in it sufficient matter of justification of the former
objections.
SECT. 1.
WE wish that our Apologists had followed the equity which the governor in
the Act. 25. 27.
Acts did in behalf of S. Paul, not only to relate exceptions, but show the
reason why; which would clear this matter, and thoroughly justify our cause
concerning Victor. It were folly to stand upon his sayings, where we see his
doings: and because our Adversaries do much and often object the example of
Victor, as though in him they were become victorious in their cause, we desire
to be tried by our evidence.

2 The history is large, but memorable, and necessary for the resolution of
this question: whereof we have summarily comprised the most pertinent points,
according as our learned adversaries have related the^ out of Eusebius, and
digested in their late volumes of Councels by their approved Surius, thus.

3 Eusebius. lib. 5. cap. 22. de Victore in hunc modum scribit: Cum quaestio erat
de seruando Paschate, Episcopi Ecclesiae Asianae seruandam magis, a veteribus
sibi traditam consuetudinem confirmabant: In quibus Polycrates, qui in ijs
primatum agere videbatur; Ego (inquit) secundum Traditionem omnium Patrum
meorum obseruo eorum duntaxat, quos ab initio secutus sum: septem namque ex
Parentibus meis per ordinem fuerunt Episcopi, ego octauus, qui omnes ita
obserua^runt hunc diem. Vnde sexaginta quinque annos aetatis gerens, in nomine
Domini multorum orbis Episcoporum notitiam plenissime habens, and sanctis
Scripturis intendens, non perturbor ex his, quae in terrorem proferuntur.
Multitudo Episcoporum nimia sententiam meam confirmat. Sed ad haec Victor,
Romanae Ecclesiae Episcopus, pertinacius agens, passim totius Asiae and
Vicinarum Prouinciarum Ecclesias a communionis societate abscindere nititur,
tanquam in haeresin inclinantes, and literas mittit, quibus omnes simul absque

Episcopis, quin potuis econtrario scribentes ei, iubebant vt magis quae pacis
sunt ageret, and concordiae and vnitati studeret. Denique extant Episcoporum

fecerit abscindens a corporis vnitate tot and tantas Ecclesias Dei, quae morem

coirent, vtque non vnusquisque sententiam suam obstinata contentione
defenderet. Neque enim aut Anicetus Polycarpo persuadere poterat, vt non
obseruaret ea, quae nouerat Iohanuem Discipulum Domini nostri, vel caeteros
Apostolos, cum quibus semper fuit, obseruasse. Neque rursus Polycarpus Anicetum
persuasit, vt morem maiorum suorum non obseruaret. Haec apud Surium Tom. 1.

Where the question arose between the Greek and Latin Church about the
observation of the day of Easter, the Bishops of the Church of Asia dissented
from the opinion of Victor the Bishop of Rome, amongst whom Polycrates did
write hereof in this manner; I Polycrates (being now threescore and five years
old, and successively the eight after seven Bishops of my The Greek is (...).
kin, who all observed the day of Easter after our custom, as did also all
our forefathers) do, in the name of the Lord, observe it in the same manner
after the tradition received from our Fathers, and from the full consent of
multitude of Bishops: and looking into the holy Scriptures, a^^ not dissuaded
nor dismayed with the terror (namely of excommunication by Victor) which is
moved against me.

4 Notwithstanding Victor goes about to excommunicate all the Bishops of Asia,
as inclining to heresy, and indiscreetly to separate them from the fellowship
of communion, which had been amongst them: who was therefore disliked by other
Bishops, commanding Victor to seek the peace and unity of the Church. Amongst
others Irenaeus did reprove him, because he divided so many, and so worthy
Churches from the unity of the body for observing the ancient traditions of
their Fathers, even from S. John: whereas before time Polycarpus a Greek
Bishop, and Anicetus, notwithstanding they could not persuade one another to
the alteration of their diverse customs herein, yes did they preserve unity
together.

The use of the former relation: taken from the due confessions of our learned
Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
5 The particulars of this story are evidently acknowledged by our Adversaries
in these their confessions: 1. that Extant ipsae literae, quibus asperius
obiurga^t Victorem, velut inutiliter Ecclesiae commodis consulentem. Bellarm.
de Romans Pont. lib. 2. cap. 19.
the letters of reproof against Victor are publicly extant. 2. that Asiani in
Concilio Asiatico, puta^tes se Euangelio and Maioru^ traditiombus inhaerere, a
consuetudine celebrandi Paschatis die 14. primi mensis, recedendum non esse
constituerunt; idque per Polyctatem ad Victorem rescripserunt, Victor Concilium
reprobabat, and Excommunicationem contra pertinaces executus est. Binius tom.
1. Conc. fol. 131. col. 1.
the Bishops of Asia did in a Council decree to maintain their ancient
custom, for the which cause Victor executed his excommunication against them:
3. that Victor Pontifex omnes Orientales and Australes Ecclesias simul a
communione amputabat, cui tunc inter caeteros excellentissimos viros restitit
Polycrates Asiae Episcoput; and Irenaeus Victorem Pontificem tanquam pacis
turbatorem acriter obiurgabat. Agrippa de Vanit. scient. cap. 59. Magna
liberate Victorem reprchendit Irenaeus, quod praeter exemplum little, quibus
successerat, tam facilis esset ad amputandas Ecclesias non in fide, led in
ritibus dissidentes. Erasmus epist. ad Episcop. Trident. de dedic. Irenaei.
Victor did also excommunicate some Churches of the West for the same cause,
and was reprehended by Irenaeus as a troubler of the Church of God. 4. that
some of the Bishops of Asia afterward became holy Irenaeus ad componendum
Ecclesiae dissid^^m Romam mittitur, Martyrum literis mirifice commendatus.
Eusebius. lib. 5.
Martyrs of Christ Jesus. And lastly, that (for ought that can be found in
history) Quod Victor sentent^am suam mutanent, nusquam legimus. Bellar. de Romans
Pont. lib. 2. cap. 19.
the excommunication of Victor was never repealed.

6 What now can our Apologists tax in our Protestant Authors, which may not be
justified by antiquity? They reprehend Victor for arrogance, and transgressing
of the bounds of his Jurisdiction in, excommunicating the Churches of Asia: and
the premises have showed, that Eusebius noted Pope Victor as offensive herein;
Irenaeus reprehended him for being a troubler of Christendom; besides
multitudes of Bishops in a Council, who (which could not be without disclaim
of the now pretended Papal jurisdiction) made Decrees against the sentence of
Victor; and yet were men themselves of that integrity both of life and
doctrine, that notwithstanding that opposition unto Pope Victor, they have ever
in the Church of Christ been honored with the memory of holy and renouned
Martyrs.

7 By all which we do necessarily euince, that the Primitive antiquity held it
not any Catholic doctrine to believe either the subjection to the bishops of
Rome to be necessary unto salvation, or his Cathedral sentence to be
infallible, or that it is a damnable state for a Christian to die in the
excommunication of that Church.

8 Nevertheless there are not any Protestants who censure Victor for usurping
an absolute power over Councels, or arrogating any infallibility of judgment
unto himself, and his successors, or to have been inspired with the spirit of
the For excommunication of another Church, does not properly imply an absolute
jurisdiction; for so some Bishops in the East excommunicated Pope Julius in the
cause of Athanasius. Sozom. lib. 3. cap. 11. and 7. Menas the Patriarch of
Constantinople did excommunicate Vigilius Bishop of Rome. Niceph hist. lib. 7.
cap. 26. how justly, is not now our question. But they doing so, did not thereby
challenge a jurisdiction over the Roman Bishop, no more then the Church of
Geneua could do, if it should excommunicate the Church of England.
now Popedom: but yet by such his immoderate action he kindled sparks, whereat
his successors long after, by little and little, raised such a flame of
spiritual ambition, as which all Christendom sithence could never quench.
Wherepon we may conclude a justification of the Protestants exceptions by the
judgment of notable Martyrs, and other Doctors both of the East and West
Church: from whence issues a confutation of their Romish Primacie. But yet
again,

CHAP. XXIII. Concerning the judgment of the ancient Father Irenaeus, in
behalf of the Primacie of the Roman Church.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Lastly S. Irenaeus (who lived next after the Apostles Scholars, and in the
same time Victor) is disliked for his affirming, that The Century writers,
Cent. 2. c. 4. col. 64. line 10.
all the Church ought to accord to the Roman Church, in regard of a more
powerable principality: wherein the Centurists charge him with See the 2.
Century in the Alphabetical table, at the word Irenaeus.
a corrupt saying, concerning the Primacie of the Roman Church.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First satisfying for the objected exception.
SECT. 1.
Our Quod in exemplaribus Irenaei, qualia nunc habemus, extat. l. 3. c. 3.

Centurists do not reprehend the ancient Father Irenaeus, but suspect that this
sentence objected is falsely fathered upon him: which they prove by light of
more antiquity, and whereunto their own learned Ante Nicaenum Concilium non

reproved by their Cardinal, as Quae sententia partim non vera est. Bellar.

Bellarmine elsewhere, As also Surius and Binius in their volu^^s of Councels,
in very many testimonies.
Adversaries deride the former kind of answering, and censuring some book of
Fathers to be corrupted, which is so common an exception in like case amongst e
themselves, in many instances of Fathers objected against them.

2 Howsoever, that testimony of Irenaeus by potentiorem principalitatem, that
is, more power able principality, does not signify an absolute spiritual
pre-eminence of the Roman See, but that for the access of honor of the
City, which at that time was (as it were) the Queen of the world, and then
professed the sincere faith in great and admirable constancy, it might
challenge the best reason of accordance: otherwise we shall be able to prove,

That the alleged testimony of Irenaeus rightly pondered, does much disable
the Romish cause, in two principal points.
SECT. 2.
3 First, the question which was then to be decided by Irenaeus, against the
heretics of those times, was concerning the perfect Scriptures. He wills
them for their satisfaction to consult with Cum ex Scripturis argu^ntur, in
accusationem conuertuntur ipsarum Scripturatum, quasi non certo habeant, neque
sint ex authoritate, and quia vary sunt dictae, and quia non possit ab his
inueniti veritas, qui nesciunt Traditionem: Non enim per liter as traditam came,
sed per viuam voce. Traditionem itaque Apostolorum in toto mundo manifestatam
in Ecclesia adest perspicere omnibus, qui vera audire velint: and habemus
coumerare eos, qui ab Apostolis instituti sunt Episcopi in Ecclesijs, and
successiones eorum vsque ad nos, quia nihil tale docuerunt, quale ab his
deliratur. Sed quoniam valde longum est in hoc tali volumine omnium Ecclesiarum
enumerare successiones, maximae and antiquissimae, and omnibus cognitae a
gloriosissimis duobus Apostolis Petro and Paulo Romae fundatae Ecclesiae, eam
quam habet ab Apostolis traditionem and fidem per successiones Episcoporum
peruenientem vsque ad nos indicantes, confundimus eos. Ad hanc enim Ecclesiam
propter potentiorem principalitatem necesse est omnem conuenire Ecclesiam, id
est, sideles, in qua semper conseruata est quae est ab Apostolis traditio.

the ancient Churches, which successively descended from the Apostles: and for
instance sake propounds unto them Rome, which (says he) has by direct
succession from the Apostles preserved this tradition, viz. of Scriptures) even
unto this time. In the which Church (this is the clause of his sentence) the
Apostolical tradition has always been preserved: herein plainly acknowledging
that no further respect may be had unto Rome, then it shall be found to have
kept the Canon of Scripture, which is the foundation of Catholic faith.

4 But this now Rome has violated the same Apostolical tradition of the Canon
of Scripture, which by all ancients from Which was Anno 160.
Irenaeus till many years after was professed in the Church of Christ. For
which cause it is that S. About the year 400.

merit. and remss. cap. 27.
the Greek Churches before the Roman Authors, among whom the authority of the
Epistle to the Hebrews was doubtful.

5 And long after the age of Irenaeus the Apocrypha books, which are now
suggested by the Romish Church for canonical, were (as our Adversaries do
witness) not acknowledged by Melchior Canus (loc. Theol. lib. 2. cap. 10.)

Hierome. And shall we think that Irenaeus, if he were now alive, would
afford this new Rome the same commendation, knowing that she has not
preserved the most sacred depositum, even the tradition of holy Scriptures?

6 Secondly Irenaeus, as has been confessed, did sharply reprehend Pope
Victor, and notwithstanding the excommunication which Victor denounced against
the Asian Churches, he and other of the West Church did willingly Caeteri
dicebant (amongst whom was Irenaeus) se nihilominus cum ijs pacem velle colere.
Eusebius. lib. 5. cap. 23.
communicate with them. Which kind of association the now Romanists at this day
would call, at the least, schismatic.

7 To conclude, when our Adversaries do argue from a confessed sincerity of
the faith of primitive Rome, for the authorizing of the now profession of this
later one, they make no better consequence then if a man, who being decrepit
would prove that he is of a sound and perfect body, because he was free from
crampes in his youth. But how this is to be accounted either a Mother, or a
Church, occasion will be given to unfold See in the sourth Book.
hereafter. From their pretense of pre-eminence we are called to a Fast and
abstinence.

in his defense, etc.
that verse Epistle of Ignatius, in which this doctrine is extant, to be his
true Epistle, and not counterfeit.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL:
First, in satisfying for the objected exceptions, and proving that this Fast
is not of divine institution: by the judgment of our Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
THis Fast, we confess, was of great antiquity, and (although in different
degrees) had in general use and observation, which S. Ambrose teaches to have
been ordained by the Hanc Quadragesima^ Dominus suo ieiunio consec^auit. P^uilo
post: -- Quisquis ergo Ch^istianus consecrata^ ieiunando non impleuerit
Quadragesimam, praeuaricationis and contumaciae tenebitur, quod legem diuinitus
datam prande^do relcindit. -- Ambros 34. and 36. A coelesti maiestate
praeceptum. -- praeceptum Donum. Ibidem.
divine institution of Christ: and Aliqui iuniores censent esse ^re diuino
sancitum: and id probant, quia aliqui veteres Ecclesiae Patres videntur
docuisse illud esse iutis diuini. Azorius Ies. Instit Moral. part. 1. lib. 7.
cap. 12.
it is also the opinion of some younger Romanists, (their Jesuit Azotius
witnessing thus much,) who therefore think it to have been commanded by
Christ, because some ancient Fathers seem to teach as much.

2 Now whether Protestants might not take exception against such testimonies of
Fathers, so far as they seem to affirm that this Lent-fast was instituted
by Christ, and whether those abouesaid younger Romanists have not been by such
testimonies deceived, we may be certified by the general consent of our
Adversaries; At communis opinto Theologorum Scholasticorum est,
Quadragesimarium i^ uni^m non esse iuris d^uini Azor. ibid.
This being the common opinion (says their Jesuit) of Schoole-diuines, that
this Lent-fast was not appointed by divine ordinance: who are therefore content
to de^iue it Sed docent Apostolica traditione seu mandato celebrari -- Item
alioq a Patres testantur, hoc ieiunium esse ab Apostolis institutum. Idem
ibidem.
from an Apostolical tradition, by the judgment (as they say) of ancient
Fathers. But yet (if we respect the generality of the command) only Statutum
est ab Ecclesia vt omnes ante Pascha iciunium Quadragesima obseruarent. Paulo
post: -- Obseruatio ista ab ipsa Apostolorum trad tione man^sse videtur: quae
ersi fortasse non a princi^ io omnes express praecepto astringebat, tamen
omnibus seculis atque omnibas o^bis partibus obseruata, etc. Iansenius cap. 15.
Concord. Euang.
doubtfully.

3 For we know that when Vibicus did foolishly contend for the necessity of
the Saturdaies fast, he was confronted by S. Augustine, saying; Ego in
Apostolicis and Euangelicis literis, totoque nouo Testamento, animo id
reuoluens, video praeceptum esse ieiunium; quibus autem diebus non oporteat,
praecepto Domini vel Apostolorum non inuenio definitum. Aug. epist. 86. And
after concludes: Vt quadraginta illi dies ante Pascha obseruentur, Ecclesiae
consensio roborauit. Epist. 119.
I read indeed that we are commanded to fast: but which ought to be the days
of our fasting, I find not prescribed in the Evangelical or Apostolical
writings of the new Testament: and in conclusion does grant, that the Lent fast
is a tradition Ecclesiastical. S. Augustine does sometime write of the forty
days fast, that it has a divine authority, but means not an authority of
precept, but of example, as in August. ibid.
Elias, Moses, and Christ.

4 Lastly, the Protestants take not exception against Ignatius, but against
them who have corrupted these Epistles of Ignatius, whose writings our Doctor
Scultetus (cited by the Apologists) affirms to have been Sunt epistolae
adulteratae, Scuitetus in the place alleged. page 440.
adulterated and corrupted. And this Epistle ad Philippenses is not found in S.
Hieromes Catalogue, where he reckons the other Epistles of Ignatius: which
makes it the rather to be suspected.

5 All that our Adversaries would say, is, that this fast ought to be observed:
we only demand, by what law? If divine, then did not S. Augustine confute
that silly disputer Vrbicus, by disprouing the necessity of his Saturdaies
fast: if it were from the ordinance of the Church, then it is not of absolute
necessity, but according to the discretion of the Church variable and
alterable: which in the next place is to be proved. Therefore we show, Hieron,
Catalog. Tit. Ignatius. And for M. Hooker and others, to allege places out of
such a book, is not altogether to warrant it.


That the manner of Lent fast used anciently, was variable, and also may be
changed according to the wisdom of the Church: even by the confession of our
learned Adversaries.

Sozomene, have showed the manifold varieties of Churches in the observation
thereof: whereupon Quia nemo hac de re potest ostendere (...), mandatum
scriptum, manifestum est quod Apostoli illud cuiusuis sententiae and voluntati
liberum reliquerunt, vt quisque nec necessitate inductus, quod bonum est
ageret. Socrates lib. 5. cap. 21. and 22.
Socrates does collect, that because we find it not commanded by writing
(which is the doctrine of Cardinal Concludit Caietanus, in Ecclesia primitiua
libera fuisse ieiunia. Caietanus, vt refert Catharinus aduersus Caiet.. De
praecepto Ieiunij. And this has been proved from antiquity.
Caietane,) we cannot but know that it was used at the first freely. Then was
it not from divine authority, and consequently not of such absolute
necessity, but that it may be altered: which we have promised to prove by
confession of some Romanist, and so (by Gods grace) we shall, yea and by such
an one, whom their Jesuit Pererius (who is himself most commendable among our
Adversaries) thus commends: e No man (says he) since the great Doctors, has
taught the mysteries of Scriptures more plainly or fully then Melchior Canus,
who was reputed a most learned Divine in the Council of Trent. Mysteria
sacrarum literarum nullus, etc, Pererius Ies. com. in Exodus and com. in Dan.
lib. 12. cap. 6.


7 This their Melchior Canus says as plainly, and as fully, that In alijs
vero, quae scilicet Apostoli constituerunt tanqua^ Ecclesiae Pastores, poterit
quidem summus Pontifex, vt in caeteris Ecclesiae legibus dispensare, sic enim
schola loquitur: poterit etiam contrarius populi mos instituta huius genetis
abrogare, vt Trina immersio. -- Eiusdem quoque ordinis est Quadragesi^^ae
ieiunium. Melchior Canus loc. Theol. lib. 3. cap. 5. fol. 102.
the Pope has power to dispense with the Lent-fast: yea and that the people
may abrogate it by a contrary custom. Therefore may we think the Apologists,
and other our Adversaries to be inconsiderate disputers, whenever they insert
this tradition of Lent-fast amongst doctrines (in their opinion) necessarily
appertaining unto the law of faith. But we are contented to hear so great an
Adversary to have confessed (notwithstanding the objected testimonies of
ancient Fathers) as much, if not more then Protestants have or would desire.
Nevertheless, for our further discharge, we add that

The differences of lawful traditions Ecclesiastical, in using or not using
them, are no just causes of dissentions in the Christan Churches.
SECT. 3.
8 It is testified by their Isti ^raeci etiamsi in obseruantia (Paschatis)
variarunt, tamen nobiscum pacifici semper fuerunt, nec dissonantia ieiunij

Surius out of Irenaeus, who advised Pope Victor in behalf of the Greek
Church (which differed from the Church of Rome in the observation of Easter:)
The difference of Fast (says Irenaeus) does not dissolve the union of faith.
This was the wise and discreet judgment (as their own Nobilis Hispanus
consuluit Hieronymum in Bethleem commorantem, cui rescripsit Hieronymus, (Tom.
1. epist. 28.) Traditiones Ecclesiasticas ita esse obseruandas, vt a maioribus

Binius notes) of Hierome and Augustine, both of them resolving, that
diversity of Ecclesiastical customs may not be any causes of distractions in
the Churches: and elsewhere S. Augustine has elegantly compounded the like
contention: Sit igitur vna fides vniuers^, quae vbique dilatatur Ecclesiae
tanquam intus in membris, etiamsi ipsa fidei vnitas diuersis quibusdam
obseruationibus celebratur, quibus nullo modo quod in fide verum est impeditur,
omnis enim filiae regis pulchritudo est intrinsecus, Psalm. 44. Illae autem
obseruationes, quae variae celebrantur, in eius vest intelliguntur, vnde
dicitur; In fimbrijs aureis circumamicts varietate. Sed ea quoque vestis ita
diuersis celebrationibus varietur, vt non contentiombus dissipetur. August.
epist. 86.
The Kings daughter (says he) is said to be all glorious within, and her
raiment to be wrought with needle work of diverse colors: so in the Church
where there is one faith, and variety of rites, the diversity of observations
in the garment may not beget a contentious opposition, in the indistinct
members of one body, which is the Church. Howsoever, with what reason can our
Adversaries accuse others of alterations, who themselves are not altogether
precise in holding their ancient limits? for we may understand,

That the Roman Church has altered her ancient Rites of fasting: by the
confession of our Adversaries.
SECT. 4.

fast not the days, which Christ fasted, but commonly begin there where Christ
ended: that their one Pope has Aliqui existimant quatuor illos dies esse
additos a Gregorio secundo: sed parum refert an Gregorius primus, an secundus

added four days unto forty, to be observed of all: another Pope has Per

Apostles, and yet are offended with the Protestants for differing from
Ignatius the Apostles See the Apolog.
Scholar, or rather his counterfeit. From this particular point of Lent fast we
ascend unto the general doctrine of religious fasting, and prove,

That the manner of a public religious fasting practiced in the Church of
Rome, is in diverse respects, reproueable by examples of antiquity; from the
confession of our learned Adversaries.
The first exception is against the indiscretion of their choice mixed with
some appearance of hypocrisy.
SECT. 5.
10 Here we have not to deal with any politic fast, but with that only which
consists in the religious mortification of the rankness of the fleshly
nature of man; to make his body, which is the temple of the holy Ghost, more
seasonable for that divine Spirit, and more comfortable for his own regenerate
soul to dwell in. This being the principal end, is also the form, and (as we
may so say) the very soul of every religious fast: by which the true nature
of fasting must be discerned from false and superstitious. Now the imputation
of indiscretion in the Romish fasts, arises from the consideration of the
time, manner, persons, and immediate end of their fasts.

11 First they allow in the time of their set fasts, Non violat ientaculum
vespertinum pro more sumptum, v^l ex causa s^^^ptum mane delato ad vesperam
prandio; nec oua aut lactieinia extra Quadragesima^. Eman. Sa, Aphorism. de
Ieiunio. Ne ante meridiem cibum sumat. Peltanus de tribus bonorum generibus, as
he is cited by Pelargus, Iesuitis. loc. 17.
an evening or a morning eating, which we may call a Breake-fast:
notwithstanding they know, that Proprie esse ieiunium, est nihil prorsus
comedere, nihil bibere. Maldon. Ies. Summula, qu. 22. art. 2.
it is properly a fast (if the nature can endure it,) to eat and drink
nothing at all, during the prescribed time of fast. This is the first
deformity, viz. to seem properly to fast eating.

12 Secondly, in the matter and measure of their fast, the practice of their
church is maruellously exorbita^t, prescribing (for so they call it) Quartum

a delicate fast, wherein they use to eat variety of roots, and fruit: besides
another, wherein is forbidden only flesh, eggs, and whatsoever comes of milk;
and yet they confess, that Aliquando prohibentur caro and lacticinia, and non

6. cap. 3.. Primo.
both flesh and white-meates are forbidden, where notwithstanding there is no
fast; as though they would teach men not to fast fasting. Again, they thus
dieting their fasters with fruits, roots, and many delicacies, would, no doubt,
be still thought zealous affecters of prime antiquity; albeit they must, and do
confess, that Mihi purio^is Christianismi, magisque consentaneum esse
Euangelicae and Apostolicae doctri^ae videatur, si nullum certum cibi genus
praescribatur. Erasmus Paraphr. in 1. Cor. 8.
it may be thought a fast more agreeable unto the Aposticall doctrine, wherein
nothing is prescribed to be eaten; bewraying a mind willing to follow
antiquity destitute of antiquity.

13 Yet is not this all, for in their fasts they forbid Ecclesia Romana
abstinentiam praecipit carnium, ouorum, casei, non autem in frigidioribus
regionibus a vino. Bellarm. lib. 2. de bonis operibus, cap. 5. In more positum

the ancient Fathers, in their Fasts, did use to abstain both from flesh and
wine. Which argues their delectum absque delectu, that is, an indiscretion in
their choice, forbidding cheese, and eating lard, by abandoning flesh, and yet
admitting wine, Vinu^ calefaciendo corpus incitat in libidine^. Bellar. lib. 2.

heathen (...): that is, the milk of Venus. So that whereas a fast is ordained
as physic to abate the pride of nature, and the fever of lust, they put in
wine, which is not an wholesome ingredient, but may seem to set the patient on
a flame, especially if it be done in any excess: whence have ensued so many
abuses among their fasters, that their own leiunia nostra, quae in vini copia

Castander can do no less then loathe diverse of their fat and foggie fastings
among them, deeming them both abominable and intolerable, and such as have
not so much as a shadow of the fasts of ancient times.

14 Thirdly, in the persons unto whom they enjoin fasting, they bewray some
partiality and indulgence: for although it be piety in the public fasts to
spare Multae sunt causae a ieiunio Ecclesiastico liberantes homines, quae ad

children, and women that suck, and women great with child, besides beggars
and weak persons; yet to license also all youth under the age of one and
twenty years, all workmen who are greatly laborious, all who by office are
employed in the oversight of any public bodily work, all Preachers and
Readers, and some kind of husbands to eat in the time of their public
religious fasts, is, we think, an indulgence void of any ancient prescription.

15 Fourthly, one Ecclesia ieiunium instituit quod est poenale. Tolet. Ies.
Instruct. Sacerd. de fine ieiunij.
end of their fasting is, that it should be in his degree (as their Jesuit
says) penal, serving for a punishment. How it may be called penal or
correctiue, we will not contend. The fast of our Savior, who Matthew. 42.
fasted and was hungry, does teach us that hunger, wherein there is a kind of
affliction, is indeed the outward perfection of a religious fast, which except
it bite of this salt, cannot be altogether so seasonable. This our Adversaries
must likewise confess, if they will call the exercise of fasting truly penal.

16 Well then, let us compare their prescribed fasts with this end: we have
heard of their fasting with breakfast, and of the nature of their delicate
fasts, where they are allowed to eat all variety of roots, fruits, fishes,
and whatsoever iunkets which have not any affinity with flesh: they are
licenced to drink wines without exception, yet so, that they eat and drink
(which is the duty of every Christian, even in banqueting) without intemperate
excess. Thus whilst that our adversaries do define fasts to be penal, and
prescribe or allow such as are so pleasantly delicate, their manner of fasting
is not void of, at least, a little leaue^ of hypocrisy, which the mouth of
almost a A child partaking once of their delicate fast, not many days after
longing for the former kind of dainties, cried to his mother, saying, Good
mother when shall I fast again?
babe may confute. Nevertheless we further show

A greater danger, either occasioned or caused by the Romish fasts, both unto
the bodies and souls of men.
SECT. 6.
17 Besides the errors already specified, other two extremities deserve
reproof, whereby both the bodies and souls of men have been iniuried: for
concerning the bodily wrongs, we hear one amongst them complaining of a In
Gallia, vt scribunt, duo periclitantur non ob aliud, nisi quia duobus
Quadragesimae diebus comederunt carnes, coacti morbo: vide quid caeremoniae
faciunt, nimirum, vt ob hominum constitutiones violemus praecepta Dei, ^^uius
ducentes parricidium, quam praeterire constitutionem Pontificum; quanquam hoc
nullus Pontifex vetuit, ne aegrotus ea sumat, quae postulat valetudo. Atque
haec impia persuasio in nonnullarum prouinciarum and ciuitatum gubernatoribus
haeret, qui per Quadragesimam in totum macellum claudunt, and seueris edictis
carnium venditionem prohibent, hoc est, inualidis (qui in ciuitatibus populosis
multi sunt qui citra carnis esum valetudinem and vitam tueri non possunt, and
piscium esu laeduntur) his, inquam, quantum in ipsis est, mortem vel ce^te
mo^bum indicunt: at, inquiunt, nemo aegrotos occulte vesci prohibet; ridiculum,
quasi non satis prohibeat vesci qui prohibet vendere. -- Erasmi responsum
oppono, Tolerabilius arbitror vt sexcenti vescantur carnibus citr^
necessitatem, quam vt vnus hac superstitione periclitetur de vita. Cassander
desens. lib. de offici^ pij viri, page 159.
wicked opinion of some Magistrates, who forbid all sale of flesh in the time
of Lent, causing thereby, as much as lay in them, either the death or diseases
of many languishing people, by a too superstitious restraint.

18 This defect (we confess) proceeded rather from the ignorance of such
Magistrates, then from the imperfection of their law of fasting; which we would
not have noted, but only because herein there is some appearance of an
iniquity; to wit, public Magistrates can transgress the law of God in more
then endangering the lives of subjects, and are not censured by their Church:
but if private men shall be known to have transgressed man's ordinance by
eating flesh secretly without cause of necessity, forthwith they are publicly
and severely punished. But we leave this injury which is incident unto the
body.

19 As the soul is far more precious, so the danger thereof is much more
pernicious, which some men of scrupulous consciences do two ways incur:
first they Nec probandi sunt, qui mente huius legis non animaduersa, ad
superstitiosam imo impiam proprij corporis debilitationem hoc Ecclesiae
statutum detorquent, dum nimia inedia, vel noxio cibo morbos sibi, nonnunquam
mortemque accersunt. -- Non refe^t, inquit Hieronymus, vtrum magno vel paruo te
interimas: quia de rapina holocaustum offert, qui vel ciborum nimia egestate,
vel manducandi, vel somni penuria immoderata corpus affligit. Cassander ibid.
page 158.
who being ignorant of the law of fasting, do (as says their Cassander) by the
strict and superstitious observation of the outward letter thereof, pine and
consume themselves with fasting: notwithstanding that (as S. Hierome teaches)
it is all one for a man to kill himself with eating too little, as with too
much, and such a faster may be said to offer unto God a Sacrifice of a thing
stolen, who by too immoderate fasting does shorten his own life.

20 This is the danger of the souls of such superstitious fasters, which
falls upon them, though not by the intention of the law of their Church, yet
peradventure by want of due explication thereof, and by the rigorous exaction
of some of their Clergy men, against whom we find one publishing this
complaint: Imprimis autem illorum hominum imperita superstitio, and
superstitiosa imperitia damnanda est, and execranda, qui huius salubris
constitutionis, ad hominum salutem (qui sinis est legis) latae sententiam and
vim ignorantes, eam ad tyrannicam conscientiarum oppressionem, and hominum
exitium, and diuinae legis trangressionem conuerterunt, dum citra discrime^
quibusuis intentata mortalis culpae poena, eius rigidam and exactam
obseruationem exegerunt, multosque hac superstitione implicatos in summa
inco^moda and pericula corporis and animae coniecerunt. Idem ibid. page 158.
We abhor (says he) the superstitious ignorance of some, who pervert the law
made for man's good, unto a tyranny over the consciences of men, and breach of
the charity commanded by the law of God, through the rigid and exact challenge
of the observation of the law of fast.

21 Yet this danger may possibly be avoided by repentance at the hour of
death, but the second peril of the soul is more contagious, which is the
opinion of a condign meriting grace and glory by the act of fasting, which
(in whomsoever it is) must needs increase together with their fast. We object
not unto our Adversaries the grossness of the Montanists, who held Montanus,
praeterquam quod priuata authoritate tres Quadragesimas instituerit, in quibus
non nisi aridis cibis vescendum esse docuerit; noua ieiunia, and nouum
ieiunandi modum instituit, abstmens a cibis quibusdam, velut a malo principio
conditis. Hanc sententiam Eleutherius damnat Binius Tom. 1. Conc. in Decret.
Eleuth. Decret. 1.
three Lents, wherein they imposed only an abstinence from dry meats, upon
an opinion (as our Adversary Binius says) that those things had an evil
beginning: but the opinion of merit, which may be thought to contain in it a
dangerous Pharisaisme; which is this, that Ieiunium valet ad satisfaciendum pro
peccatis, and ad praemium coeleste promerendum. Bellar. lib. 2. de bonis
operibus, cap. II. Tollet. Instruct. Sacerd. page 568. Salmeron tom. 4.
fasting (as Cardinal Bellarmine in the name of his Church professes) is
auailable to satisfy for sin, and to merit and deserve an heavenly reward.

22 This kind of humility we have See above.
proved to be an infectious pride, and therefore do we assent to the more safe
and moderate judgment of our learned Adversaries, who cannot without grief
but confess, that diverse Diffitendum non est, homines superstitiosos and
imperitos qui huiusmodi Ecclesiae ritibus ad salutem hominum factis, ad
tyrannidem and conscientiarum laqueum abusi sunt: atque etiam multi ex vulgo in
earum obseruatione fiduciam collocarunt. Cassander Consult. art. 16. Nihil
habere momenti ad pietatem, quibus vescamur cibis. Erasmus in 1. Cor. 8.
superstitiously affected, have abused the rites of fasts, which were for their
good, unto the tyranny and snare of their own consciences, reposing
confidence in the observation of them; so far, that their whole religion Hic
grauissimi viri Erasmi verba ascribere malo: At quidam (inquit) clamant, quis
nescit in caeremonijs non esse constituendum finem pietatis^imo quis nescit
totam religionem hactenus fuisse redactam ad caeremonias, ac vigorem
Euangelicum fuisse per cas propemodum antiquaturn? Cassander Defens. lib. de
officio pij viri, page 158.
stands upon ceremonies, to the abolishing almost of the vigor and strength
of the Gospel. It will be expected that we show

What the doctrine of Protestants is, concerning Fasts.
SECT. 7.
23 Because our Adversaries are prone to object an Epicurisme unto Protestants,
no otherwise then Vrbicus did unto the Catholics, (of whom S. Augustine said,
Ventricolas magnus ieiunator accusat. August. epist. 86. Casulano Presb.
The worthy faster accuses us for bellygods,) as though Protestants contemned
all manner of religious fasts: we cannot choose but take up S. Augustines
answer, and apply it unto them, Nemo legem sicut iste, intelligit, ni^i qui non
intelligit. Aug.
No man has that understanding of the matter, but he that is destitute of
understanding. Wherefore that every one may rightly apprehend the doctrine of
Protestants, we think it sufficient to have it published, especially from his
pen who is most traduced by our Adversaries in this argument.

24 Duo sunt^ciunia laudabilia, vnum civil a Magistratu sancitum certis
temporibus, quae est ordinatio vtilis and necessaria, ne luxu omnia absumantur:
Alteru^ est spirituale, Christianis omnibus seruandu^. Atque equidem ben^
ageretur si aliquot diebus ante festum Paschatis, and Pentecostis, and
Natiuitatis Domini communite. seruaremus, it a tamen vt caueamus, ne ex
^eiunijs nos aliquid a Deo promereri credamus. Est and aliud ieiunium
perpetuum, and potissimum vt corpus tuum co^^ceas, and in sobrietate contineas.
Ecce tibi, hoc dictum ieiunium verum esse dicendum existimo, quando totum
corpus castigatur cum omnibus quin que se^sibus, abstinendo ab illis quibus tam
belle afficitur and delectatur. Tale ieiunium hoc aetatis non multum inuenttur
ap^^ ^^onachos. Luther. de die Domin. Natah Christi proximo.
There be two kinds of laudable Fasts (says M. Luther,) the one civil,
appointed by the Magistrate, which is to abstain from certain meats at
certain times, for the better providing for the commonwealth, lest the
necessary store be consumed with riot: the second kind is spiritual, to be
observed of all Christians; and it were very good that this might be performed
for certain days before the feasts of Easter, and Pentecost, and the
Nativity of our Lord; always with this caveat, that we put no opinion of
merit in them. There is yet another fast, which ought to be perpetual among
Christians, which is upon occasions for the chastizing of the flesh, that is,
when the whole body is corrected in the five senses abstinence from such
things, wherein our outward man is naturally delighted. This kind of fast (and
he knew very well) is not much used in Monasteries. And again, Omnino per
ieiunium corporis castigatio and ^oderatio nobis commendatur, sed nequaquam eo
animo suscipiendum est, quasi aliquid per illud vel s vel salutis, vel
iustitiae meritum para^e, sed duntaxat ad castigandum corpus, and commodandum
proximis. Atque hoc pacto vere se^uis in ieiuniji tuis Deo, dum illud gratuito
in honorem ipsius, and ad extinguenda peccata and domandam carnem propriam
suscipis. Qui edendo ieiunant, carnem s^am cituis irritant, quam domant.
Luther. lect. Euang. die Domin. a Nat^li Christi.
A fast is not to be used with a conceit of meriting thereby, but only to the
subduing of the flesh, and better helping of our neighbor. And thus thou shall
truly serve thy God, when as thou shall undertake this freely for his honor,
and to tame thy flesh: but those who eat fasting, do rather provoke lust, then
subdue it. What now remains, but by due comparison to try,

Whether the doctrine of Protestants or of Romanists be more safe in Christian
profession, and practice of a religious Fast.
SECT. 8.
25 Both kind of Professors do require public and religious exercises of
fasting, the end whereof should be the taming of rebellious flesh: but first
they differ in the manner of exaction. The Romanists command the time of forty
days fast, upon a bond of. 1.
necessity: the Protestants in the tenor of liberty, which liberty is not
permitted unto every private man; for this would engender a confusion: but is
belonging unto particular Churches of several nations, accordingly as it was
used in ancient times by the evidence of Ecclesiastical. 1. and 2:
stories.

26 Secondly, the Romanists free. 5.
all under twenty years of age, all Preachers, Readers, and whosoever are
employed in bodily labors; the Protestants charge all Christians to fast, so
far as the indifferent ability of nature shall permit.

27 Thirdly, the Romanists account it a fast, by the Decree of their Pope
Telesphorus Pontifex in suo Decreto quod habetur Did. 4. Cap. Statuimus.
Statuimus vt septem hebdomadas plenas Clerici in sortem Domini vocati, ^ carne
ieiunent, Vbi, vides, nihil aliud esse ieiunium, quam a carni bus abstmere.
Salmeron Ies. tom. 4. part. 1. tract. 11.. Innocentius. page 105.
Telesphorus, which is only an abstinence from flesh: but Protestants define a
true fast, to be an abstinence (in them that are able) from all nutriments;
which has been. 5.
confessed to be more agreeable unto antiquity.

28 Fourthly, the Romanists prescribe fasts as religious corrections, and
penal exercises, and do notwithstanding pamper their people with variety of.
5.
delicates: but Protestants urge an abstinence from all natural delights;
which crosses that conceit, where with some men have been possessed, and were
anciently condemned by S. Famam abstinentiae quaerunt in delicijs. Hieron. ad
Nepotian.
Hierome; who sought a fame of fasting in the use of delicates. How much
greater hypocrisy may that seem to hatch, which has professed Penance in
their pleasant repasts?

29 Fifthly, the now Romanists ascribe unto the observations of their fasts
power of. 6.
merit and satisfaction: but Protestants teach men in actions of humiliation to
put upon them the spirit of humility, and not to trust unto the merit of their
Fasts: and some of our Adversaries have confessed, that. 5. and 6.
the putting of confidence in such observations has been the snare of men's
consciences, and darkning of the truth of the Gospel.

30 Lastly, this Romish fast is Dispensare vel generaliter vt nullus teneatur
reiunare, vel non illis, vel illis diebus, est solius Papae: dispensare vero
singulariter cum illo vel illo iusta de causa, vel ne illo vel illo die,
potest, Episcopus, vel illo ab^ente parochus. Compend. Manualis Nauarri, as it
is cited by our ^elargus, Iesuitis. loco 17.
dispensable by their Popes and Bishops, and Pastors both generally and
particularly: and so is made a bait of their pecuniarie Indulgences; which
has been confessed by witness of our Adversaries to be a See above lib. 1.
cap. 2. Sect. 22.
deceitful novelty. So that if we further would examine the discretion of a
Fast, in respect of the nature of meats, the sentence of S. Bernard may direct
us, where answering to such as Repleti ventrem faba, mentem superbia, cibis
damnamus saginatos, quasi non melius sit exiguo sagimine ad vsum vesci, quam
ventoso legumine vsque ad ructum exsaturari, and praecipue cum Esau non de
carne, sed de lent sit reprehendendus, and de ligno Adam non de carne
damnatus, and Ionathas ex gustu mellis, non carnis, morti adiudicatus: e contra
vero Elias innoxie carnem comederit, etc. Bernard. apolog. ad Guliel. Abbatem,
tom. 1. col. 1285.
filled their bellies with peason, and swelled in their minds with pride,
says, that it is more safe to take food moderately for our refreshing, then to
be crammed with pulse, especially remembering how Esau was not reprehended for
eating flesh, but for lentels, nor Adam condemned for flesh, but for the fruit
of the tree, nor Jonathan endangered for flesh, but for the taste of honey.

31 And if again we rightly discern the leprosy of Mass See confuted above,
cap. 11.
merit, then may we also be persuaded that our godly and reverend Archbishop
(here objected by our Apolog. page 19. number. 9.
Apologists) had some cause thus to resolve: B. Whitgift in his defense, page
102. the place objected by the Apolog.
I think (says he) that in S. Austens time a man might have observed this
rule of fasting without offense unto God, but I do not think that he may do so
now in like manner; because it is certain that in the Church of Rome there are
many wicked opinions, both of the difference of meats, and also of merits
adjoined unto them: so that if it were a sin not to fast as S. Ambrose and
those Fathers did, it is more sin to fast as the Papists do.

32 Be thou notwithstanding (good Reader) mindful of that saying of God by the
Angel unto Sara, when her servant Hagar was brought back unto her, Genesis 16.
Behold (says he) she is in thy hands, do with her what thou willest: so if
thou be endued with the spirit of God, thou have thy body committed unto thy
discretion to chastise by private fasting, and to humble it unto thy Christian
service, and by public according unto the godly discretion of that Church
wherein thou live; always remembering the lesson of Ieiunarunt Niniuitae, and
iram effugerunt; ieiunarunt Iudaei, and nihil profecerunt. -- Iram istam non
soluebat ieiunium aut saccus, sed vitae immutatio. Ion. 3. Vidit opera eorum,
etc. Quod non dicimus, vt ieiunium contemnamus, sed vt honoremus, honor enim
ieiunij est vitae emendatio. Chrysostom. in Matthew. 7.
S. Chrysostom, teaching that the perfection and honor of a religious fast
consists not in fasting, but in amendment of our lives.

CHAP. XXV. Of unwritten Traditions.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
12 Twelfthly concerning unwritten Traditions and Ceremonies, and first
concerning unwritten Traditions, it is confessed as follows.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing the State of the question as it is unfolded
by our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
THis Argument of Tradition which our Adversaries make to be, as it were, the
Metropolis of all their presumptions, will appear to be but an aerie meteore,,
after that the state of this controversy shall be thoroughly laid open, and
other particulars discussed, which are incident thereunto. The importance
hereof may crave an extraordinary patience of our godly Reader in perusing our
answer, and diligence in examining our proofs; for now we contend for the full
sufficiency and perfection of the Oracles of all truth, and the foundation of
Christian faith, which is the written word of God: thus then

2 Controuersia inter nos and Protestants, in duobus consistit; primum est
quod nos afferimus in Scripturis no^ co^tineri express totam doctrinam, sieve
de fide, sieve de moribus, and proinde, praeter verbum Dei scriptum, diuinas and
Apostolicas Traditiones esse necessarias. Lutherus huic doctrinae dicit
Anathema. Omnes volunt omnia ad salutem necessaria, in ipsis Scripturis
contineri. Secundo dissidemus, quod illi existimant Apostolos quaedam
instituisse praeter Scripturas, quae ad ritus and ordinem Ecclesiae pertinent,
quae tamen non sunt necessaria, nec praecepta, sed libera. Nos contra. Bellar.
lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 3. in initio.
The difference between Protestants and us (say the Romanists) concerning
Tradition, consists in two things; we hold that all doctrine necessarily
belonging unto faith and manners of life, is not expressly ( Non ob eum finem
Scripturae datae sunt, vt essent totius fidei regula sufficientissima, vel vt
omnem veritatem complecterentur ant expressam aut ex proprijs principijs
deducendam: Protestants contra. Stapleton. doctrine. princip. lib. 12. cap 3.
Ecclesia Catholica in ijs quae sunt sidei non est alligata ad Scripturas
tantum. Ibid. cap. 4.
or by way of necessary consequent) contained in Scripture, but affirm, that
besides the written word of God, other divine and Apostolical unwritten
Traditions be necessary. But all Protestants hold, that all things necessary
to salvation are contained in the written word: Desensio Protestantium in
Colloquio Ratisbonensi fuit, hoc argumentum locum habere contra eos tantum, qui
Scripturae authoritate^ non recipient, non autem contra eos (such as are all
Protessants) apud quos praesupposita est Scripturae sacrae authoritas. Tannerus
Ies. aduersus Relat. Hunni. cap. 12.
yet so, that the question have place amongst them, who believe the authority
of Scriptures. Bellarmine in the place before alleged.
Our second difference is, that they think indeed that the Apostles ordained
rites and ceremonies, which are not written in Scriptures, but such (say they)
as were for decency only, and left unto the liberty of the Church to be used,
or changed.

2 This we confess to be a full and true relation, distinguishing aright of
the articles of this controversy, which these Apologists, and other our
Adversaries, in obiecting testimonies of Fathers against the Protestants
doctrine, have either subtly or ignorantly For though in the beginning of
this Section they distinguish in word Traditions and Ceremonies, yet in their
allegations they do so confound them, that their Reader cannot discern when
the Fathers speak for Tradition or for ceremonies: and so may he more easily
be mislead to think^ that all Fathers writ for the Tradition of doctrines
against the sufficiency of Scripture.
confounded. For our more ready and safe passage through this great Ocean, we
make this our first examen:

Whether Protestants do confess themselves, in this question (concerning the
sufficiency of Scripture,) destitute of the general patronage of ancient
Fathers.
SECT. 2.
4 This the Apologists may seem to intimate, but with great injury against
not only Whose sufficiency is to be adored. See hereafter. 11.

writers, who avouch that the whole stream, in a manner, of all antiquity
does clearly go with them; Doctor Whittakers and Doctor Reynolds, in the very
objected places, affirming, that concerning all points* necessary for
salvation, the Fathers do with one general voice commend the sufficiency of
the Scriptures; which we are further to demonstrate. But yet first in our
second examen we must try,

Whether our Adversaries can rightly digest the testimonies of those ancients,
by whom the doctrine of Tradition is plainly subverted.
SECT. 3.
5 The Romanists yield not unto the book of God his due perfection, but leave
it like a sick man's broken and imperfect will, half nuncupatiue, and half
written, and do except, as they list, against ^uch testimonies of antiquity as
plead for the prerogative of holy Writ. For when S. Cyprian is alleged as
adhering unto the Vnde ista traditio? An ex Dominica authoritate veniens, an de
Apostolorum mandatis atque epistolis veniens? ea enim facienda esse quae
scripta sunt, testatur Deus. Cyprian epist. 74. ad Pompe^^m.
written Tradition of truth, they reject him, saying, that he did this Hoc
dixit, cum errorem suum tuer^ vellet. Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 11.
in maintenance of his error. By which answer, they (although he unwillingly)
lend S. Austen a blow, who commends S. Cyprian by name, saying hereof, that
Quod Cyprianus monet, vt ad fontem recurramus, id est, Apostolorum traditionem,
optimum est, and sinc dubitatione faciendum: traditum est enim nobis (sicut
ipse commemorat) ^b Apostolis quod fit vnus Deus, and Christus vnus, vna spes,
and fides vna, and vna Ecclesia, and vnu^ baptisma. Ephesians. 4. August. lib. 5.
de Baptis. cap. 26.
the admonition of Cyprian is the best, and must doubtless be performed.

6 When the Author of the imperfect work upon Matthew under the name of S.
Chrysostom counsels Christians, Nulla probatio potest esse verae
Christianitatis, nisi a Scriptura diuina Christiani volentes sidei suae
^irmitatem accipere, ad nullam rem aliam confugiant, nisi ad solas Scripturas.
Opus imperf. hom. 49. in Matthew. 24.
to receive the grounds of their faith only from Scriptures, not admitting any
proof of their Christian religion, but only from Scriptures: they answer, that
Hoc non est Chry^ostomi testimonium, sed operis imperfecti: and hic locus ab
Arianis insertus est, quibusdam codicibus nuper emendatis sublatus est. Bellar.
lib. 4. de verbo Dei; cap. 11.
Chrysostom was not the author of that book, and that, these words are
inserted by the Arian heretics: and again, to make all sure, they have lately
taken order that these words be put out, and not used in their editions of
Chrysostom. If this be justifiable, then how shall the authorized writings of
their own Doctors escape the same blot? for their Jesuit Acosta commends the
Author of this book for one Author operis imperfecti cum Ambrosio, Irenaeo,
and alijs comparandus est. Acosta Ies. de temp. nouiss. lib. 2. cap. 12.
comparable in learning to Ambrose, Irenaeus, and other Fathers; and their
Jesuit Eleganter sane Author Operis imperfecti in Matthaeum, volentibus
cognoscere quae sit vera Ecclesia, non est alius modus, nisi tantummodo per
Scripturas. Salmeron Ies. com. in Romans in proem. part 3. disp. 3. Tit. De
falsis Ecclesiae signis.
Salmeron expounds this part of the sentence of the same Author (which is, to
discern the true Church only ^y Scripture) and extolleth the rest as
excellently well spoken; which notwithstanding their Church (as Bellarmine See
above at lit. e.
tells us) has purged and left out of their new editions, as sauouring of
her^sie. Or how shall the acknowledged S. Chrysostom be dealt with, when he is

found clearly to avouch that same truth?

7 The most religious Emperor Constantine may not be thought to have been
heretically affected, when he admonished the Fathers and reverend Bishops of
the first Council of Nice, in all their questions Constantinus Magnus

to consult only with those heavenly inspired Scriptures, because they do
fully instruct us what to believe in divine things: whereunto their Cardinal
Bellarmine answers thus, Respondeo, Constantinus Magnus Ecclesiae Imperator,
non magnus Doctor fuit. Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 11.
Constantine was indeed a great Emperor (says he,) but no great Doctor, Which
answer, if not rather scorn, does not only touch Constantine, Eusebius quidem

who (as their own Bishop Espencaeus notes out of Eusebius,) was esteemed in
the Church as it were an universal Bishop appointed by God himself for the
peace thereof: but does also blemish the judgment of all the Catholic Bishops
in that famous Synod of Nice who (as Trecenti december and octo Episcopi ibi in
vnum conuenerant. -- Imperator omni genere laudis illustrissimus, verba facere,
etc. -- At quanquam pars maxima Concilij verbis eius obtemperauit: tamen, --

scripta sunt, desiderantem. Hoc qui repudiat, Antichristus est; qui simulat,
Anathema. Hilar. in lib. quem Constantio ipsi tradidit, page 212. Basileae anno
1590.
Hilary both admired in Constantius the son of Constantine, and also
pronounced him an Antichrist and Anathema that refused to have his faith to be
tried only by Scriptures.

8 This is the common voice of ancient Fathers, as will hereafter be proved.
Till when, these few testimonies may serve to abate the edge of eagerness
which is in these Apologists, in their fierce opposition against some
exceptions taken by Protestants, against some testimonies of ancient Fathers;
which now we are to examine,

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Concerning unwritten Traditions and Ceremonies, it is confessed as follows,
Whereas (2) Chrysostom. in 2 Thessalonians. hom. 4.
S. Chrysostom says, (3) The Apostles did not deliver all things by writing,
but many things without, and these be as worthy of credit as the other: M.
Whittaker in answer thereof, Whittaker de sacra Scriptura, page 678. paulo post
med.
I answer that this is an inconsiderate speech, and unworthy so great a Father:
and whereas Epiphanius says, Epipha^. haer. 61. circa med.
We must use Tradition, for the Scripture has not all things, and therefore
the Apostles delivered certain things by writing, and certain by Tradition:
with whom agrees S. Basil saying, Basil. de Spir. sanct. cap. 27.
Some thing we have from Scripture, other things from the Apostles Tradition
etc. both which has like force unto Christian Religion: M. D. Reynolds
answering to these foresaid sayings of Basil and Chrysostom, says, D.
Rainolds in his Conclusisions annexed to his Conference, the first conclusion,
page 689.
I take not upon me to controlle them, but let the Church judge if they
considered with advice enough, etc. Whereunto might be added the like confessed
Where Eusebius. lib. 1. demonstr. Euang. cap. 8. is objected to say that the
Apostles published their doctrine, partly by writing, partly without writing,
as it were by a certain unwritten law. M. Whittaker de sacra Scriptura, page
668. fine, says thereto, I answer that this testimony is plain enough, but
in no sort to be received, because it is against the Scriptures.
testimony, from Eusebius.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: In answering for the alleged exceptions against the
testimonies of Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Basil, and Eusebius.
SECT. 4.
9 Here are not many testimonies of Fathers expressly urged, whereby our cause
may seem to receive any prejudice in the doctrine of unwritten Traditions. The
first is the testimony of S. Chrysostom, wherein if by these words, [as
worthy of credit] be meant the Traditions ceremonial, in this sense we must
believe certainly that the ceremonies ordained by the Apostles were just, and
lawful, albeit (as even our Adversaries See a little hereafter.
do teach) alterable: so this sentence does not differ from the profession of
Protestants. But if the Romanists will have it understood of doctrinall points
of faith, which are absolutely necessary unto salvation, as though some such
article were not recorded in Scriptures; then was it not unjustly to be
censured a speech unfitting the golden mouth of Chrysostom: because so S.
Chrysostom should contradict himself in many places, not only of his
supposed works (as has been See above. 3. lit. e.
showed) in so plain sort justifying our defense of only Scripture, that
their Church has therefore in their new editions of Chrysostom wiped that
sentence out: but also in his unquestionable works, yea even in his Homily next
going before the objected testimony, where exhorting all men to be exercised
in reading the Scriptures, Omnia clara sunt and plana ex Scripturi^ diuinis;
quaecunque necessaria sunt, manifesta sunt. Chrysostom. in 2 Thessalonians. 2. hom. 3.
All things (says he) which are necessary, are manifest; and yet again more
plainly, Non oportet quicquam dicere sine his testibus ^olaque animi
cogitatione; nam si quid dicitur absque Scriptura, auditorum cogitatio
claudicat, etc. In Psalm. 95. Bellar. resp. quo supra. Hic prohibetur ne quid ex
nostra inuentione sine Scriptura dicatur False, for that which a man shall say
only of his own invention in divine matters, were not in it self ridiculous
and condemnable, although it cannot be reproved by Scripture: therefore he
calls that of our own invention, which is not warranted by Scripture.
Man must say nothing (says he) of his private intention, without testimonies
of Scripture. For the which cause he calls the sacred Scriptures Praesertim
cum habeamus omnium exactissimam trutinam, and gnomonem, ac regulam, diuinarum
legum assertionem: ideo absecro and oro omnes vo^, vt relinquatis quidnam huic
aut illi videatur, deque his a Scripturis haec omnia inquirite. Homil. 13. in
2. Corinthians. Bellarm. resp. Non loguitur de omnibus dogmatibus, sed de opinione
carnalium, qui anteponun^ opes paupertati. False, for Chrysostom speaks
generally, (...), id est, omnium exactissimam regulam habemus, etc. And he
adds a reason: Quomodo non absurdum est propter pecunias alijs non credere,
sed ipsas numerare and supputare: pro rebus autem amplioribus aliorum
sententiam sequi simpliciter. A reason generally fitting all matters belonging
to Divinity: then follows this our propounded, Praesertim, etc.
a most exact balance, square, and rule of divine laws. Wherein Chrysostom
is irreconciliably contrary unto the Romanists, who for the defense of
unwritten Traditions do esteem of Scripture, not as of a most exact, but only
as of Scriptura etsi non est facta praecipue vt sit regula fidei, tamen est
regula fidei non totali^, sed partialis. Bellarm. lib. 4. de verbo non scripto.
cap. 12.. Dico secundo.
a part of a rule of faith.

postea agnoseat se in duplici statu virginitatis constitutum esse, vt aut

Authors, (whom these obiectors do allege,) fully satisfied, who have proved,
first, that diverse Traditions which Epiphanius fancied, were confuted by
ancient Fathers: S. Hierome crossing him in his Tradition concerning the place
of Christ's birth, and of Adams sepulcher: Cyprian, in his Tradition of the
breach of a vow: Augustine, in his Tradition of the times of fasts.

11 Secondly, our Adversaries may not absolutely exact his judgment herein,
except (according to the Traditions by him specified) they will be bound never
to cut their beards: and likewise recant their now Romish doctrine, which
teaches (contrary unto Epiphanius) that See above lib. 1. cap. 2.. 35.
it is better to wallow in daily fornication, then after a vow to be coupled in
wedlock.

12 Lastly, we are in this question thus directed by Epiphanius himself: Nos
vniuscuiusque quaestionis inuentionem non ex proprijs ratiocinationibus, sed ex
Scripturarum consequentia discere possumus. Epiphan. haeres. 61. but more fully
haeres. 69.
In invention of truth we are in every question to learn what to hold, not
from our own reasons, but from the consequences of Scripture.

13 In the third place the testimony of Object. Basil. de Spir. sancte, cap. 7.
Quo in loco plurimos enumerat ritus ab Apostolis institutos: quaedam addit
essentialia, vt Symbolum Apostolicum, and vnctionem in Confirmat. alia etiam
commemorat, quaelicet non ex se necessaria, tamen postquam praecepta sunt
necessaria, vt sine peccato non omittantur. Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap.
6.
Basil is objected, and has been likewise satisfied by our Answer: Primo
dubitari possit vtrum haec vera and genuina Basilij verba sint, neene: Erasmus
hunc librum in dubium vocauit Praef. in Verse. Basil. Secundo, si sunt haec ipsa
verba Basilij, secum ipse pugnat, quia docet necessaria omnia ad salutem
reperiri in Scripturis. Tertio, Zachariam illum Matthew. 23. 35. Iohannis

Quarto (cum loquitur de ritibus) ait Euangelium sine traditione scripta vim
nullam habere, sed esse (...). Videamus quales sint ipsae Traditiones, an sint
tanti precij: inter alia, [conuerti nos oportere ad Orientem cum precamur,]

sunt necessariae, cur ipsi Pontificij eas omnes no^ obseruant? si non sunt

obligare atque scriptas Traditiones, licet non quo ad obseruationem, tamen
quoad fidem: sic praecepta Dei alia maiora, Dilige Deum; alia minora, de verbo

obseruationem. Resp. At Papistas multas ex his Traditionibus tum quoad
obseruationem, tum quoad fidem abrogasse: at ne minimum praeceptum in

Maximus and Theophilus are of less moment. See Kemnitius.
Doctor, proving from the judgment of Erasmus, that the objected book cannot
be necessarily fathered upon S. Basil: secondly, by way of Dilemma; for if the
Traditions, which Basil accounts necessary, be (notwithstanding his
authority) not necessary, why are they objected? But if by his authority they
must be judged necessary, how shall S. Hierome be excused, who rejected the
Tradition approved by Basil concerning the person of Zachary, mentioned,
Matthew. 23? Or what shall be answered for Eucherius and Socrates, who confute the
necessity of praying toward the East? or Chrysostom, who (contrary unto
Basils necessity of blessing the water) teaches, that all waters are by
Christ his baptism sanctified for baptism? or how shall any plead for
Cyprian, Gregory, and the Council of Toletum, who altered and condemned Basils
necessity of threefold dipping of the baptized into the water? Or lastly,
wherewith may the Romanists justify themselves, who usually pray kneeling,
contrary unto Basils necessity of standing in prayer, all the time between
Easter and Pentecost?

14 Thus (we see) our Adversaries by exacting the authority of one, do
condemn the judgment of many, whereas (especially seeing this book cannot be
proved to have been Basils) they should rather have consulted with other both
many and plain testimonies in his undoubted works; where he judges it
Infidelitatis argumentum est, and signum superbiae certissimum, si quis coru^,
quae scripta sunt* aliquid velit reijcere; vel eorum, quae non sunt scripta,
introducere. Basil. Sermon. de fidei Confess. Where although he confute private
opinions, yet does he use a general principle, and therefore adds in the
same place, Apostolus per humanum exemplum vehementer prohibet aliquid diuinis
Scripturis vel addere, vel demere, cum dicit, Hominis testamentum nemo
reprobat, aut aliquid ei superstruit; proinde quamcunque alienam a Domini
doctrina vocem ac mentem, ita nos semper and nunc fugiendam cog nouimus. There,
indeed, he uses new words, but such as contained no new doctrine, for he
says, Non sunt alienae a sensu Scripturae.
an argument of infidelity, and an evident sign of pride in any, who shall
reject either any doctrine that is written, or bring in any which is not
written. Likewise in another Tract (which is by our Adversaries attributed unto
him) he holds it Necessarium est and consonum, vt ex sacra quis Scriptura
quod necesse sit diseat, ad pietatis plerophoriam, tum ne humanis Traditionibus
assuescat. Basil. Reg. contract. q. 95. Si quicquid non est ex fide, peccatum
est, vt vult Apostolus, Fides vero ex auditu, auditus autem per verbum Deitergo
quicquid extra Scripturam diuinam est, cum ex fide non sit, peccatum est.
Basil. Ethic. Reg. 80. c. 22.
necessary, that every one learn out of Scripture, what is necessarily to be
learned, both for his full persuasion in points of godliness, and also lest he
be carried away by humane Traditions.

15 Now follows Eusebius, whose sentence we Fuseb. lib. 1. Demonst. Euang. c.
8. Caeterum, inquit. Moses in tabulis inanima^is; Christus autem in mentibus
vita praeditis perfecta noui Testamenti documenta descripsit. Eius vero

have fully related: where (to pass over other Ait Eusebius, Christum non
omnia omnibus tradidisse, sed excellentiora quaedam perfectis hominibus
reseruasse; atque sic etiam fecisse Apostolos: long aliter Irenaeus lib 3.

Traditiones, quas Papistae venditant, vt sint omnibus communicandae. So M
Whittaker de sacra Scriptura, q. 6. cap. 12.
answers) if by Tradition unwritten, he meant matters not necessarily belonging
unto faith, it does not weaken our cause, which defends only that See
confessed above in the state of the question, Cardinal Bellarmine.
doctrines necessary to be believed are written in Scripture: but if they will
understand thereby doctrines which are necessary for every man to believe,
then the clause of Eusebius, where he says, that the people were taught partly
by written Traditions, partly by unwritten; cannot agree with the consent of
our Adversaries, affirming that all things absolutely necessary for all men's
salvation, are written in Scripture: and thus must the Romanists either grant,
that the testimony of Eusebius makes not against Protestants, or else
confess, it makes against themselves. And we cannot be persuaded that
Eusebius, who writ a book in commendation of See above Sect. 3. number. 7.
Constantine, could dissent from his confessed resolution so greatly approved
in the Council of Nice, whom our Adversaries have rejected. We return unto

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And thus much briefly concerning the Fathers of the Greek Church. Now as
concerning the like confessed doctrine of the Fathers of the Latin Church, (to
avoid tediousness,) S. Austen only (as being most Gomarus in speculo verae
Ecclesiae, etc. page 96. ante medium, says: Augustinus patrum omnium, communi
sententia, purissimus habetur.
approved by our Adversaries) shall serve for all: who laboring to prove, that
those who are baptized by heretics should not be rebaptized, says, August de
Bapt. contra Donat. lib. 5. cap. 23.
The Apostles commanded nothing hereof, but that custom which was opposed
herein against Cyprian, is to be believed to proceed from their Tradition, as
many things be, which the whole Church holds, and are therefore well believed
to be commanded of the Apostles, although they be not written. Wherein and See
the like saying in Austin epist. 118. ad Ianuarium.
other his like sayings, his meaning is so evident and confessed, that M.
Cartwright speaking thereof* says, See M. Cartwright in M. Whitgifts defense,
etc. page 103. ante medium.
To allow S. Austens saying, is to bring in Popery again: and that See M.
Cartwrights words alleged vbi supra.
if S. Austens judgment be a good judgment, then there be some things
commanded of God, which are not in the Scriptures, and thereupon no sufficient
doctrine contained in the Scriptures.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 5.
16 We see no reason why we may not so far admit S. Augustine, in this
question, among the Latin Fathers, (seeing our Adversaries so please) that he
alone may serve for all. The matter in controversy is, indeed, a doctrinall
question, to wit, whether those, who have been baptized by heretics, ought to
be rebaptized. S. Cyprian held that they ought, alleging, that except the
contrary Vnde est haec Traditio? an ex Dominica authoritate descendens, an de
Apostolorum mandatis and epistolis? ea enim facienda esse, quae scripta sunt,
testatur Dominus. Cypr. epist. 10. ad Pomp.
Tradition may be proved out of Scripture, it deserves no credit. S.
Augustine, although he maintain the contrary conclusion unto Cyprian, saying,
that they which have been baptized once, may not be baptized again; yet does
he hold S. Cyprians caution, viz. the necessity of proving this doctrine by
Scripture: judging this (which our Adversaries call an See before, page 343.
erroneous exception) to be indeed Quod Cyprianus monet, etc. See above, page
343.
the best course; which he himself presently follows, confirming his
question of not rebaptizing by Scripture, as Ephesians. 4. and euincing the same
truth (to use his own words) by Ne videar humanis argumentis agere, ex
Euangelio profero certa documenta. August. contra Donat. lib. 1. cap. 7. tom. 7.
sure proofs out of the Gospel; and again, Perspectis disputationis
rationibus, and Scripturarum testimonijs, potest dici, quod veritas declarauit,
hoc sequimur. Ibid. lib. 4. cap. 7.
by testimonies of Scriptures well wayed; and yet again, Potetat iam
sufficere, quod tot repetitis testimonijs, adiunctis etiam Scripturarum
documentis ostendimus. Ibid. lib. 6. cap. 1. See also de Gen ad lit. lib. 10.
cap. 23. The instance which Bellarm. gives, is confuted.
which we have showed (says he) by Scriptures. So plainly make these for the
perfection of Scripture, that our Adversary Cardinal Bellarmine without an Si
hae, Augustini, coniecturae non valent nisi post Concilij definitionem, vt vult
Bellarminus, cum non valebant quando ijs Augustinus pugnabat contra Donatistas,
adhuc enim nihil de hac re erat contra Donatistas in Conc* aliquo definitum. So
Whitaker de sacra Script. q. 6. page 457. which fully overthrows the answer
which Bellar. used, Augustinum vsum fuisse coniecturis ex Scriptura, quae
aliquid valent ad confirmandam veritatem post Concilij definitionem, sed per se
non sufficient. Ibid.
error cannot tell how to shift them.

17 In the second like saying (as they call it) of S. Augustine, which we have
related from their Object. August. epist. 118. Illa quae non scripta sed
tradita custodimus, quae quidem toto terrarum orb seruanturr, dantur intelligi
vel ab ipsis Apostolis, vel plenarijs Concilijs, quorum est in Ecclesia
saluberrima authoritas commendata, atque statuta retineri: sicut quod Domini
passio, and resurrectio, and ascensio in coelum, and aduentus de coelo Spiritus
sancti anniuersaria solennitate celebratur. Vt refert Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo
non scripto, cap. 7.. Sed Augustinus.
Cardinal, the obiectors might have been satisfied by our learned Author whom
they have produced: Answer: Hae traditiones non ita sunt magni momenti: nam
sine his omnia possunt esse in religione salua. Secundo Augustinus nescit number
istorum dierum obsertiatio ab Apostolis an a plenarijs Concilijs instituta
fuerit* vocat quidem has necessarias, sed quomodo ad salute^? nullo modo, sed
quod necesse esse cuiuis illas seruare, quocunque se conferret ad seruandam
(...), and scandala remouenda. Postremo Socrates lib. 5. cap. 22. Sozom. lib.
7. cap. 19. August. epist. 86. scribunt nihil omnino de festis diebus
praescripfisse, aut Christum, aut Apostolos. M. Whittaker de sacra Scriptura,
quaest. 6. cap. 12.
who shows that these are questions of ceremonies, and not of doctrines of
faith: things which are necessary to be be kept in their times and places for
fear of scandal, but not of necessity unto salvation. Neither yet has S.
Augustine defined, that these Festiuals are by Apostolical Tradition: but
elsewhere (according to the light of Ecclesiastical history) he confesses,
that neither Christ nor his Apostles prescribed any certain times of fasting.

18 The consequent which they urge out of T. C. is not altogether so
conclusiue, for they might well conceive, that albeit we can be contented that
S. Augustine may serve for all Latin Fathers; yet are we not bound to admit
that M. Cartwright shall serve for all Expositors of S. Augustine, especially
knowing that he has been so learnedly confuted by our reverend Bishop in
reply unto that objection, saying, that this sentence of Augustine (even in
that sense propounded) is the overthrow of Popery: because this Romish Article
can never be proved by due concurrance of antiquity. But concerning M.
Cartwrights inference, we have more occasion to answer See hereafter.
hereafter: we return unto S. Augustine, in whom we further insist, and prove,

That S. Augustine in this question of Tradition, is an excellent Patron of the
Protestants Assertion: in defending the sufficiency of Scripture.
SECT. 6.
19 To know how little cause our Adversaries have to single out S. Augustine to
serve for all, we shall need no better witness then S. Augustine himself:
Vltimo proferunt Augustini testimonia, ac primum lib. 2 de doctr. Christ. cap.
9. In his, quae aperte posita sunt in Scriptura, inueniuntur illa omnia, quae
continent fidem moresque viuendi. Etiam in lib. de bono viduit. cap. 1. Sancta

testimonia, sed solum coniecturae quaedam ex diuinis literis. Bellar. ibid.
Amongst those things (says he) which are contained in Scripture, all those
things may be found, which concern faith, and manners of life. But why? Holy
Scripture (says he) is unto us the rule of doctrine, lest we should be wise
above that we ought. What then? Whenever there is question made (says he) of
a case of greatest difficulty, and we have not clear proofs of Scripture for
our conclusion, so long must man's presumption keep silence.

20 These proofs are both very perspicuous and pertinent, whereunto our
Adversaries cannot make any answer, but with their greater For the first

unwritten tradition is simply necessary for all men. Thirdly, if by the
judgment of S. Augustine, Scripture be sufficient for direction in the most
obscure questions, such as is the original production of the soul, then
certes much more sufficient must they be thought to be in questions of more
necessary consequence.

general for the proof of one particular.
God has set in Scriptures a foundation against the seducement of error, and
a rule of godliness, that we may be wise unto sobriety.

21 These be infallible testimonies of the sufficiency of holy Writ. What now
remains, but that we hear S. Augustine pronounce an Proinde sieve de Christo,
sieve de Ecclesia, sieve de quacunque alia re, quae pertinet ad fidem vitamque

Anathema upon all them who shall teach any thing either of Christ or his
Church, or any other matter of faith, besides that which is received from
Legal and Evangelical Scriptures? whereunto we wish our Adversaries would
subscribe? But they proceed.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Add but now hereunto, that See Kemnitius examen. part 1. page 87. 89. 90.
Chemnitius reports for their like testimony of unwritten Traditions,
Clemens Alexandrinus, Origin, Epiphanius, Ambrose, Hierome, Maximus,
Theophilus, Basil, Damascene etc. That M. Fulke See Mr. Fulke against
Purgatory, page 362. ante med. and 303. and 397. and against Martial, page
170. 178. and against Bristowes Motives, p. 35. and 36.
also confesses as much of Chrysostom, Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine,
Hierome, etc. that lastly, M. Whitaker See Master Whittaker de sacra Scriptura,
page 678. 681. 683. 685. 690. 695. 696. 670. 668.
acknowledges the like of Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Tertullian, Cyprian,
Augustine, Innocentius, Leo, Basil, Eusebius, Damascene, etc.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: In answer unto the objected testimonies of Clemens
Alexandrinus and Tertullian; which have been objected by our Adversaries with a
sinister conscience.
SECT. 7.
22 If the Obiectors had thought the testimony of S. Augustine auailable in it
self, for avoiding tediousness (as they said) to serve for all the Latin
Fathers, they should not have needed these new additaments, wherein they
sensibly affect that tediousness, which seemingly they promised to avoid. But
to the purpose.

23 They begin with Clemens Alexandrinus, belike not without cause; for their
Cardinal herein would seem in a manner victorious, saying: Ob. Clemens
Alexandrinus dic^t sibi extorqueri i fratribus, vt ea quae a Presbyteris
Apostolorum successoribus, voce sibi sola, tradita essent, deseriberet in
libris, and posteris traderet. Whence Bellarm. Quid clarius pro Traditionibus
dici potest? Lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 7.
What can be more clear for unwritten Traditions, then this? Wittingly
concealing what kind of Traditions this Clemens meant: which these our Not
mentioning the answer of Kemnitius, proving the reason of Clemens, Quia
Christus reuelauit paucis (...), quae non erant multis communicanda, to be
condemned professedly by Iren^us and Tertullian, as being the pretense of old
heretics: next he shows what kind of Traditions were suggested by Clemens: 1.
Graecos iustificatos fuisse Philosophia, lib. 6. Strom. 2. Christum vno anno
praedicasse, lib. 2. Stro^. Hanc haeresin Iren. l. 2. c. 39. haereticis
tribuit. 3. Sieve hic sieve alibi agi poenitentia^. 4. Apostolos post morte^
impijs apud inferos Euangelium praedicasse, qui in vita non poterant audire
Euangelium, lib. 6. Strom. 5. Christianos non posse contendere iudicio nec
coram Gentibus, nec coram Sanctis, lib. 7. Strom. and alia similia multa. So
Kemnitius, examen* part 1. Tract. de Tradit. 6. Clemens lib. 2. Strom iecit
semina haereseos Nestorianae, vt Heruetus interpres indicauit in margin. 7. Et
in lib. 3. ait Christum nec vere esurijsse, nec vere sitijsse, sed visum esse
sitire, and ^surire: and moreover, librum obiectum non extare. Thus M.
Whittaker desacra Scriptura, quaest. 6. cap. 12.
Authors remember to have been Justification by philosophy, Repentance after
death, Preaching the Gospel unto the wicked in hell: these and other such like
were the Traditions; so worthy of all concealment, that all Christians on both
sides are ready to condemn them, as being no better then seeds of heresies:
besides that his reason, which he used for confirmation of such Traditions,
viz. Christ (says he) revealed (...), mysteries, to few, which were not
communicable unto others; has been (our Authors showing the same) as expressly
confuted by Irenaeus and Tertullian, who accounted this fancy to be the chief
foundation of old heresies. Yet this must be, forsooth, the clear defense of
their Traditions.

24 Next is produced the testimony of Ob. Tert de Corona Militu: Harum
discipliplinarum Traditio auctrix, and in lib. 1. contra Marc. and lib. 2. ad
vxorem. and lib. de veland. virg. agit de Traditionibus: etia^ lib. de
praescript. docet haereticos non ex Scripturis, sed ex Traditione refutandos
esse. Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 6.
Tertullian, but out of such books of his (as our Answer: Lib. de Corona Milit.
and de veland. virg. were written in his Montanisme: but add, Pertinet ad
Montanicas destructiones, quod Tertull. in lib. de exhort ad castitatem
disputat: -- obijcit sibi, ergone primas nuptias destru^s? respondet, nec

objected. Tertull. cum l^brum de corona Militis scripserat, Montanista erat:
dixit enim se habere illum paracletum, quem Christus promiserat, and fretu^
huius paracleti authoritate, mults (...) in Ecclesiam inuexit. Quanquam

doctrinam aliquam non scriptam, sed ad eius doctrine defensionem and
propagationem. So M. Whittaker in the places objected.
Authors show,) which wereby him professedly written against the Catholic
Church, from whence he had revolted unto the sect of Montanists. Here indeed,
our Adversaries have much matter for their Traditions, but it is of that kind
as must (if they will needs defend it) prove them no Catholics: because
Tertullian then a Montanist, defended (...), a prescription of set fasts by a
law of necessity, and an abstinence from certain kind of meats with an
opinion of sanctity, eagerly inueighing against the Catholic Church for
denying the manner of their fasts by dry meats: and for calling such kind of
rites a novelty: not to mention his condemning of second marriages: he himself
being for such errors condemned by S. Hierome and other Fathers, as an
Adversary unto the Catholic Church. And his Traditions in the place alleged,
are threefold mersion, giving honey and milk unto persons baptized, receiving
the Eucharist at the time of meat: which our Adversaries themselves have in
their wisdom rejected.

25 Might it not have become the Apologists (if they had been studious of
truth) to have left Tertullian, where Tertullian left the true Church? but
peradventure they did foresee, that if they should be urged to consult not with
the Montanist, but with the Catholic Tertullian, their hold of Tradition would
suffer a breach. For Tertullian in his book of Prescription written against
heretics, does (as Doctor See the testimony going before.
Whitaker has proved,) wound their cause; and elsewhere he disputes against
the heretic Hermogenes negatiuely from Scripture, thus: Profert. 11. Tertull.
qui lib. contra Hermog. Adoro, inquit, Scripturae plenitudinem. Scriptum esse
doceat Hermogenis officina. Si non est scriptu^, timeat vae illud
adijcientibus, vel detrahentibus destinatum. Respondeo, loquitur Tertull. de
vno dogmate tantum, quod scilicet Deus creauerit omnia ex nihilo, non ex
praeiacente materia, vt Hermogenes somniabat. Etquoniam hoc dogma apertissime
continetur in Scripturis, dicit Tertullianusse adorare Scripturae plenitudinem,
quantum ad hoc dogma; and addit, Hermogenem qui addebat ad Scripturam dogma
contrarium, and repugnaus ipsi Scripturae, incidere in ipsam male dictionem,
qua prohibemur nihil addere, aut detrahere Scripturae, ita vt veritas eius
immutetur. Bellar. lib. 4 de verbo Dei non scripto, cap. 11. page 182. Answer:

Ergo vae, etc. In libro de resurrectione carnis Haereticos vocat [Lucifugas]

nos cupiunt in omni disputatione a Scripturarum luce deducere. Et libro de
carne Christi [Si non probant, quia nec scriptum est:] and mox, [Sed nihil de
co constat, quia Scriptura non exhibet. So Doctor Whittaker in the places
objected.
This thy doctrine is not written, therefore is there due unto it a woe, which
is denounced against them, who add unto Scripture: wherein he is so confident
as to profess, that heretics cannot prevail, if they shall be compelled to
stand only to Scriptures. From which again he argues negatiuely, thus; It is
not proved (says he) because it is not written: then the which nothing can
make more for the proof of the sufficiency and perfection of sacred Writ.
After this discharge, will be expected

An answer unto the other Fathers alleged by the Apologists.
SECT. 8.
26 It would be (we fear) not only a matter of tediousness, but even a kind
of torment unto our judicious Reader, to insist, with us, upon all their

Epiphanius, See above. 4.

rest, which in the margent are by our Authors sufficiently answered.

27 The sum of all is this, that the Traditions which have been objected, if
they may be deduced out of Scripture, (such as the Infantes posse baptizari
deducitur euidenter ex Scripturis. Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram. Baptis. cap. 9.
Baptism of Infants, and the Dico articulos fidei primarios de Deo, Christo,

the Catechism of Trent proves every article out of Scripture.
Apostles Creed are confessed to be:) then are they not properly to be
reckoned amongst their unwritten Traditions: but if they be properly unwritten,
they may be conceived as either contrary unto Scriptures (such as the
testimonies of Clemens Alexandrinus, and Tertullian appeared to be,) and
therefore cannot be equalled with Scriptures: or else were not held as
necessary, (as for example the times of See above cap. 24.
Fasts and festiuals, and their diverse rites in In duobus consissit
Sacramentum Baptismi, verbo and elemento; ideo etsi alia desint, quae ad
decorem Sacramenti instituta sunt, non ideo minus ve^um esse Sacramentum and
sanctum, si verbum sit ibi and elementum, Lombard. lib. 4. did. 3.
Baptism etc.) and therefore do not so much as touch the list or hemme of this
controversy: or lastly, such as have been abrogated by the Romanists
themselves, (whereof we have many See above in the state of the question.
examples;) which therefore men not importunately contentious, would in
discretion have buried in the grave of silence.

28 To conclude, we find not any Tradition absolutely unwritten ( See in the
Section following.
whether doctrinall or ceremonial,) delivered by the Fathers, to be of that
nature, as that it Sacrosancta Synodus -- Accipimus omnes libros tam veteris
quam noui Testamenti, necnon Traditiones ipsas tum ad fidem tum ad mores
pertinentes, tanquam vel ore tenus a Christo, vel a Spiritu sancto dictatas,
and continua successione in Ecclesia Catholica conseruatas, pari pietatis
affectu and reuerentia sus^ipit and veneratur. Synod. Trid. Sess. 4. Decret. 2.
ought to be embraced (this is the Romish profession) with the like godly
affection and reverence, as we do the sacred Scriptures. This we hold to be in
Divinity more then a paradoxe, as both the above mentioned, and the now
following examples do certainly demonstrate.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Now as concerning ceremonies, M. Calfehill (to omit others) affirms, that
Hereof see M. Fulks reioinder to Martials Reply, printed 1580. p. 131. fine and
132. initio:
the Fathers declined all from the simplicity of the Gospel in ceremonies.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Satisfying for the exception from the complaints of
ancient Fathers, against the ouerspreading corruptions of doctrines, and
ceremonies of their times.
SECT. 9.
29 For the Author came not unto my hands.
If our Author intend by simplicity of the Gospel such a profession, which
will not allow of any ceremonies in the Church, except they be expressly
delivered, this (as has been acknowledged by our greatest See above. 1.
Adversary) is contrary to the common doctrine of Protestants: but if by
simplicity be understood a virtue opposite either unto supers^uitie or
superstition, then it belongs unto us to try how justifiable this exception
may be proved to be: none can desire any better proof hereof then which may be
taken from the confession of the Fathers, and the practice of our learned
Adversaries.

30 First therefore understand, that Papias, who was the disciple of S. John,
did (as Papias multa paradoxa (...), id est, tanquam ex Traditione non scripta
ad se re^ata adijcit, and peregrinas quasdam doctrinas cum alijs nonnullis
fabulosis, in quibus est Chiliastica opinio. He adds a reason: Mediocri
iudicio erat praeditus. The effect: Papias quamplu^imis post se viris
Ecclesiasticis erroris chiliastici occasione^ dedit. He adds a reason, Quia
praetenderunt antiquitatem istius viri. Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 33. as it is
prosecuted by Kemnitiu^. So Basil: Non omnia eius viri laudamus, sunt quae
etiam pro^sus damnamus, habent enim quaedam seminaria impietatis (...). Basil.
epist. 41. de D^^nys. Alexandrino.
Eusebius witnesses) broach many paradoxes and exorbitant doctrines, in
pretense that he had received them by Tradition from the Apostles; thereby
occasioning many other Ecclesiastical Doctors, (who were moved by the
antiquity of Papias) to fall into the error of the Chiliasts. And shall we
think that those purer times, when some ancients not content to keep regiam
viam, that is, the rode-way which is the written word of God, but were seduced
by presumption of unwritten Traditions, and erred in points of docttine; could
be altogether free from some sprinklings and spots of ceremonious corruptions?

31 It is a See above Chap. 22.. 1.
known contention about the observation of Easter, which afflicted and vexed
the Church of God in the days of Victor Bishop of Rome, by dividing the East
and West Churches, the one side pretending a Tradition from S. John and S.
Philip; the other presuming of a supposed Tradition from S. Peter and S. Paul.
Whereby was made a schism and rent not in the garment only, but even in the
body of Christ, which is his Church.

32 These two examples may serve for many, which might be alleged, to give us
more then a signification of the danger and uncertainty of unwritten
Traditions, which the aftertimes, even of S. Augustine (not to wade deeper into
this poole) had more cause to complain of: whom we find bewailing the
corruptions of his age, and confessing, that he Multa huiusmodi propter
nonnullarum, vel sancta^um, vel turbulentan^m personarum scandala deuitanda
liberius improbare non audeo. -- Sed hoc nimis doleo, quia multa quae in
diuinis lib^i^ salube^^ima praecepta sunt minus curantur; and tam multis
praesumptionibus ple^^a sunt omnia. August. epist. 119. cap. 19.
durst not freely reprehend many Traditions, whereby the Church was then
pestred, and which he calls presumptions; and consequently, could not agree
with the simplicity of the Gospel of Christ. But we draw nearer unto the
Apologists, and show clearly,

That our Adversaries confess themselves to have abrogated many unwritten
Traditions, which in their own For the objected places of the Fathers for the
necessity of Traditions, do particularly mention the points following.
opinion were held of the ^ore-named Fathers to be no less necessary or
Apostolical, then are the other unwritten doctrines or customs, which the
Romanists defend.
SECT. 10.
33 All the testimonies which we allege, are the plain confessions of our
learned Adversaries: Trina mersio in baptismate, quae Traditio ab Apostolorum
Canone profluxisse videtur, iamdiu per contrariam consuetudinem abolita est.

not observing almost eight Canons of eight^e, which by Pope Clemens were
supposed to be Apostolical.

34 In all these we hear of nothing but of altering, dispensing, abrogating,
abolishing of Customs, Rites, Ceremonies, Canons (in their opinions) general,
ancient, and in most part necessary and Apostolical. If this be done (as they
presume) justly, how shall they not excuse, if not commend Protestants for the
like abrogations, whom notwithstanding they therefore ordinarily charge with
intolerable contempt? Or how shall not our discreet Reader discern which
professors do more ingenuously incline unto the simplicity of the Gospel;
whether the Romanists, who disanull and abandon such rites, although in their
judgment they seemed to have been Apostolical; or Protestants, who judging
the most of these as not Apostolical, do for the uncertainty of such like
traditions, zealously affect especially such orders, which they are persuaded
did successively and succesfully descend from Antiquity, admitting only of
those rites, which may neither oppress the Church by their number, nor by
their nature corrupt it? We return back again to salute the Senate of
Antiquity, and now at length show,

That the ancient Fathers with common consent, do profess and adore the
sufficiency of Scripture, in all doctrines necessarily belonging unto points of
faith, or precepts of life.
SECT. 11.
35 This question of Tradition being, as it were, the Epitome of all Romish
controversy, it may exact of us a more ample discharge, which is to be
performed by pregnant testimonies of Antiquity. Euangelium per Dei voluntatem
in Scripturis nouis tradiderunt fundamentum and columnam fidei no^trae futuru^.

diligentius Prophetas: inuenietis vniuersam actionem, and omnem doctrinam, and
pass^onem Domini nostri praedicatam in ipsis.
Irenaeus calls the Gospel written, the pillar and foundation of faith, and
reproved heretics for accusing the Scripture, as though by it truth may not be
found of them who are ignorant of Tradition. Origin held it Necesse est
Scripturas sanctas in testimonium vocare: sensus quippe nostri sine his
testibus non h^bent fidem. Origin. hom. 1, in Ierem. And again:
necessary that we bring the testimonies of Scriptures: Sicut omne aurum quod
fuerit extra templum non est sanctisicatum, sic omnis qui fuerit extra diuinam
Scripturam (quamuis admirabilis videatur quibusdam) non est sanctus, quia non
continetur a sensu Scripturae, quae solet cum solum sensum sanctificare, quem
habet ^^se, sicut templum proprium aurum. Origin. hom. 25. in Matthew. To the
first Bellarmine answers nothing to the purpose: to the second, nothing at
all. Again: Vide qu^m proximi periculis fiant hi, qui exerceri in diuinis
literis negligunt, -- ex quibus solis huiusmodi examinationis agnoscenda
discretio est. Origin. in cap. 16 ad Romans lib. 10 This, Cardinal Bellarmine
pretermitteth.
without which we deserve no credit, but are like as the gold without the
Temple, unhallowed. Athanasius proclaimed the Scripturae (...), sufficient ad

avoiding of Traditions, to admit of nothing as necessary, which is not
consonant unto Scriptures. S. Chrysostom taught, that See above. 6. in the

whatsoever is spoken without Scripture, does lame the understanding of the
hearer: and called Scripture, in respect of the sufficiency thereof, an exact
rule and Canon of faith: and Merito ostium Scripturas appellat, quoniam nos ad
Deum ducunt; and eius nobis cognitionem aperiunt: ipsae oues faciunt, ipsae
custodiunt; neque lupos erumpere permittunt. Tanquam enim ostium firmissimum

a most firm door to keep out a Wolf: judging him a thief that ascends
any other way then by it. Epiphanius maintained, that See above. 5.
we may learn to find out every question from the consequence of Scripture.
Cyril Alexandrinus defended, that Non omnia quae Dominus fecit, conscripta
sunt, sed quae scribentes tam ad mores quam ad dogmata sufficere putaueru^t, vt
recta fide and operibus, and virtute rutilantes, ad regnum coelorum
perueniamus. Cyrill. in Ioh. lib. 12. cap. 68. And again: In duobus
Te^^amentis omne verbum requiri posse, quod ad Deum pe^tineat. Homil. 5. in
Leuit. Whether we call the author hereof Cyril or Origin, it is not material.

adored the fullness of the Scriptures: and hereupon pronounced a woe upon them
that broached any thing which was not justifiable by Scripture, whereunto he
would have heretics compelled to stand. Theophilus judged it to be a property
of a Diabolici spiritus est aliquid extra diuinarum Scripturarum authoritatem

devilish spirit to think any thing divine which is without authority of
Scriptures. Cyprian demanded, See before. 4. Add, Non aliunde loquendum est
de rebus fidei, nisi ex literis fidei. Cyprian.
What is this Tradition? from whence comes it? from the authority of Christ
in the Gospel, or the precepts of the Apostles in their Epistles? and has
therefore been rejected by our Adversaries, albeit he has been by S. Augustine
therein both justified and commended. S. Hierome accounted all teaching which is
Sine authoritate Scripturarum garrulitas non habet fidem, nisi viderentur
peruersam doctrinam diuinis eloquijs roborare. Hieron. com. in 1. cap. epist.
ad Titum. Sed alia quae absque authoritate aut testimonijs Scripturarum, quasi
traditione Apostolica spoute reperiunt atque confingunt, percutit gladius Dei.
Idem comment. in 1. cap. Haggaei. The answer of Bellarmine, saying, that it is
spoken against those, who feine some things of themselves, which they would
have seem to be Apostolical, cannot help him, for Hierome speaks of (...),
id est, humi dormitiones, which themselves esteem ancient: Ecclesiam vrbes
habere Legis, Prophetarum, Euangeliorum, and Epistolarum, and non egressam esse
e finibus suis, id est, de Scripturis sanctis. Hieron. in 1. cap. Mich.
destitute of the authority of Scripture, a vain babbling, and all such stuff
to be worthy to be cut with the sword of Gods Spirit: the sufficiency of which
Scripture he preached, as being the bounds and limits, which the Church of God
may not pass. Ambrose asked, Sanctis Scripturis non loquentibus quis loquetur?
Ego quid facere potuerit nunc praetermitto, quid fecerit quod aperta
Scripturarum authoritate non didicit, tanquam secretum praeterco. Ambros. lib.
3. Hexam cap. 3. and lib. 2. de vocat. Gent. cap. 3.
Who shall speak when the divine Scriptures are silent? therein putting all
men to silence, who preach doctrines of faith without Scripture. Vincentius
Lyrinensis judged Non quia Scripturarum Canon solus non sibi ad vniuersa
sufficiat: sed. etc. Vinc. Lyrinens. cap. 41.
the Canon of Scripture only sufficient unto all things. Theodoret thought it
wisdom, Non audeo dicere aliquid quod tacuit Scriptura diuina. Theod. 2. dial.
contra Haeret.
not to dare to say any thing which divine Scripture has concealed. Damascene
professed, that he sought Nos ea omnia, quae tradita sunt, and per Legem, and
per Prophetas, and per Apostolos, and per Euangelistas, recipimus, agnoscimus,
colimus, approbamus: -- Sed nihil praeter haec aliud quaerentes. Damascen. de
Orthodox. fide, lib. 1. cap. 1.
for nothing besides Scriptures. S. Augustine, whom the Apologists did choose
to be the mouth of all the Latin Fathers, has concluded, that See more above
6. And again: Alijs vero testibus vel testimonijs, quibus credendum esse
suadetur, tibi credere vel non credere liceat, quantum ea momenti ad faciendam
fidem, vel habere, vel non habere perpenderis. August. epist. 112. Ego solis
Scripturis Canonicis debeo sine recusatione consensum. Lib. de natura and Great.
cap. 61.
in those things, which are plainly delivered in Scripture, are contained all
things which concern faith or godly life, etc. Whatsoever is confirmed by
Scripture, must be believed; other witnesses thou may believe according to
thy discretion. And to this purpose has he See above. 6. and 4. etc.
called the Scriptures the foundation laid by God against all entanglements of
error; the fixed rule of doctrine: beyond which it is no sobriety to be wise:
the divine balances, wherein doctrines are to be examined and tried whether
they be heavy or light: and in the end pronounced every one Anathema that
teaches doctrines, which are not contained in Scriptures.

36 And hereunto agrees the forecited testimony of See above. 3.
Constantine the great, and first Christian Emperor, so greatly honored in
the first and most famous Synod of Nice: where he desired that the divine
books of the Prophets and Apostles might be laid before them for their
sufficient instructions in divine causes: unto whom all the Orthodoxall Bishops
in that Council yielded their present assent. The which S. See ibid.
Hilary approved in the Emperor Constantius, so far forth as to account him
an Anathema, and an Antichristian one, whosoever shall gainsay it. And now we
come to try,

Whether profession, of the Romanists or Protestants, be the more safe and
secure for a Christian man's resolution: decided by the consequences of our
learned Adversaries.
SECT. 12.
37 From the Senate of Fathers we are come into the Schools of our Romish
Adversaries, and wish that the true This same question concerns not those
questionist^, who ask how shall we know the Scriptures to be the word of God,
but by Tradition? but the controversy is only between those parties, who do
acknowledge the truth of the Scriptures. Which accordance once presumed, then
follows this point, whether this Scripture, which we have received by
Tradition, be not the sufficient Canon of all necessary matter of faith, and
precepts of holiness?
state of the question may be remembered, viz. whether all they that acknowledge
the truth of the Canon of Scriptures, ought not likewise to profess this
sufficiency in them, to wit, that they contain in them all necessary Canons
and rules which may concern all necessary doctrines of faith, or directions
of life. The Protestants have affirmed it, the Romanists have denied it: and
these our Adversaries lay it down for a fundamental conclusion, Tertium
fundamentum: Multa pertinere ad Christianorum doctrinam and fidem, quae nec
aperte nec obscure in sacris literis continentur. -- Sanctorum Martyrum
auxilium precibus esse implorandum, eorum que memorias celebrandas, imagines
venerandas esse, -- sacrae literae nusquam forte tradiderunt. Canus locis
Theol. lib. 3. cap. 3.
That there are many things belonging unto the doctrine and faith of
Christianity, which are neither expressly nor obscurely contained in Scriptures.
Which Traditions their Council of Trent has decreed to be worthily
Sacrosancta Synodus, -- Omnes libros tam veteris quam noui Testamenti, cum
vtriusque Deus vnus sit Author: nec non Traditiones ipsas tum ad fidem tum ad
mores pertinentes, tanquam ore tenus, vel a Spiritu sancto dictatas, and
continui successione in Ecclesia Catholica conseruatas pari pietatis affectu
and reuerentia suscipit and veneratur. Conc. Trid. Sess. 4. Decret. De
Canonicis.
honored with equal affection and devotion, as is due unto the books of the
old and new Testament. And whereas Protestants require such a Catholic Council
which may be animated with the spirit of the written word, from whence only,
and not from Traditions, all conclusions of necessary doctrine may be taken:
our Adversaries judge this Conditionem hanc Protestants exigunt, vt in
Concilijs ex sola Scriptura diuina sententiae ferantur, non ex Traditionibus.
-- Respondeo, est conditio iniqua. Bellar. lib. 1. de Conc. cap. 21.. Quarta
conditio. and. Quarto,
condition to be unjust. For the Scripture with them is but See above
half a rule of our faith. This doctrine is that leaven which we wish, might
be purged: and to this end we borrow some help from the consequents and
confessions of our learned Adversaries. But first by consequence.

38 If that all doctrines, (as their Quaedam in doctrina Christiana [tam fidei
quam morum] esse simpliciter omnibus necessaria [ad salutem] notitia
articulorum Symboli Apostolici, item cognitio december praeceptorum, and
nonnullorum Sacramentorum. Bellarm. lib. 4 de verbo non scripto, cap. 11..
Primum, etc. And a little after: Nota secundo ea quae sunt simpliciter
necessaria, Apostolos consucuisse omnibus praedicare: aliorum autem non omnia
omnibus, sed quaedam omnibus, quae nimirum erant omnibus [vtili^] etc. Ibid..
Nota secundo. Then, Dico illa omnia scripta esse ab Apostolis, quae sunt
omnibus necessaria, and quae ipsi pal^m omnibus vulgo praedicauerunt. Idem ibid.
Cardinal confesses) which are simply necessary, or profitable for all men,
are contained in Scripture; then by necessity of consequence their doctrines
of Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, worshipping of Images, Indulgences,
Auricular confession, Prayer for the dead, Merits, etc. and many other their
Romish Articles (which our See above in every particular treatise.
Adversaries have proved not to be contained in Scripture,) must be none of
those doctrines which are necessarily to be believed of all Christians: and S.
Paul has said (Ephesians. 2.) that there is but one God, one faith, one baptism:
therefore are we to dream no more of different faiths, then we may of diverse
Gods.

39 Secondly, our Adversaries argue thus: Nonne ad solas Scripturas Haeretici
appellabant, Traditiones repudiabant? Stapleton. lib. 2. de author. Eccles.
cap. 6. Greg. de Valent. Ies. lib. 6. Analys. cap 8. Tannerus Ies. Colloq.
Ratisb. Sess. 8.
Heretics (say they) did refuse Traditions, and appealed only unto
Scriptures. Ergo Scriptures are not sufficient rules of the doctrine of life.
By this consequence we may contrarily reioyne, viz. seeing that our learned
Adursaries, to wit Omnes Haeretici (inquit Augustine.) audacias figmentorum
suoru^, quas maxim exhorret sensus humanus, hac occasion Euangelicae
sententiae colorare conantur, quasi haec ipsa sint, quae tunc Discipuli portare
non poterant. Quis autem nostrum audeat eorum se dicere iam capacem, quae illi
capere non valebant? Aquinas in Catena aurea in hunc locum.
Aquinas, Irenaeus lib. 1. ca. 23. scribit de Basilidian. quod assera^t no^
oportere eorum mysteria eff^ri, sed in abscondito continere per silentium: and
cap. 24. de Carpocratianis, and Tertull quoque lib. de Praescript. solent
dicere non omnia Apostolos scisse, vel omnia quidem scisse, sed non omnia
omnibus tradidis^e. As is confessed by Cardinal Bellarmine, lib. 4. de verbo

Scriptur is inquiunt, quarum senteotia aliqua est, and in omnem partem
versatilis, parum laboramus. Edwardus Weston^s de tr^plici hominis officio,
lib. 3. cap. 22.
Weston, do confess almost of all the most notorious and pestilent heretics,
(such as were the Valentinians, Gnostics, Marcionists, Basilidians,
Encratites, Seucrians, Manichees, Arrians, Aerians, Carpocratians, Montanists,
Archonticks, Donatists, Anabaptists, etc. yea and of all Heretics, that they
refusing to be tried only by canonical Scriptures, did shelter themselves
under the pretext either of philosophical principles, or feined Gospels, or
forged Traditions (pretended to be Apostolical) or fancied Revelations. In
which last point the Anabaptists are confessed not to have been inferior, who
(as their Doctor Weston reports,) presuming of their divine Revelations,
neglected the Scriptures, accounting them a dead letter. We by the due
opposition, which we are to hold against this Hydra of heretics, all possessed
with the same spirit of detracting from the sufficiency of holy Scripture, may
warrantably profess our full resolution of faith to depend of Gods Letters
patents, the divine Scriptures.

40 Thirdly, the manner of reasoning negatiuely from Scripture: as thus, [that
doctrine is not in Scripture, Ergo it is no necessary doctrine of faith,] is
(if it be true) so demonstratiue an argument to establish the truth of
sufficiency of Scripture, and to infringe the Romish faith of unwritten
traditions, that their See above cap. 7.. 9.
Cardinal durst not admit thereof: yet notwithstanding our Adversaries do so
argue in confuting the corruptions of the Greek Liturgies, Against the Greek
Liturgies, [Ostendant ex Christi facti^ aut mandatis, etc.] See above lib. 1.
because such points cannot be proved from the written institutions of Christ;
and in confirming of the pretended prerogatives of S. Peter, Dictum est Petro,
and nulli praeterea Apostolorum, Tu es Petrus, etc. Ego pro te oraui: Petri
nomen mutatur, non aliorum: Petrus nusquam non primus nominatur. Bellar. lib.
1. de Romans Pont. cap. 16. lib. 4. c. 3. lib. 1. cap. 10. and 17. and 18.
because we read not of any such promises made unto any of the other
disciples. Their Bishop Roffensis by affirming, that Cum Purgatorij doctrina
sit omnibus scitu necessaria, non est credibile illud non posse ex Scripturis
probati. Roffens. Episc. art. 37. aduers Lutherum.
it is not credible, seeing Purgatory is a doctrine of faith, but that it may
be proved out of Scripture, does yield us our conclusion of defending nothing
to be a necessary doctrine, which is not proved out of Scripture. Their Jesuit
See above. 9.
Suarez determines, that the Priests eating of the Eucharist is not the
essential part of a Sacrifice, because it is not directly euinced out of
Scripture. Their Boniuentura ait, quia Euangelistae nullam mentionem huius
institutionis (speaking of extreme unction) faciunt, verisimile esse Christum
illam non instituisse. Suarez Ies. disp. 39.. 2. Tom. 4.
Boniuenture excepteth against Extreme unction as not instituted by Christ,
because it is not mentioned in the Evangelists. Their Pope See above cap. 4.. 5.
Julius renounceth the sopping in of bread in the Eucharist, because it is not
in the Gospel. All which do euince our manner of conclusion.

41 Lastly, they pretend that the Traditions which they affirm to be written,
are, Traditio non igitur dicitur non scripta doctrina, quod nusquam scripta
est, sed quod non inuenitur scripta in vllo libro Apostolico, etiamsi scripta
sit in libris veterum patrum. Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 2.. Vocatur.
although not in the Bible, yet in the books of ancient Fathers: which albeit
we should for this present suppose to be true, yet will their Iustus Baronius
have us observe out of S. Augustine, Neque enim sic potuit integritas atque
notitia literarum vniu^ quantumlibet illustris Episcopi custodiri, quemadmodum
Scriptura Canonica tot linguarum literis, ordine and successione celebrationis
Ecclesiasticae custoditur; contra quam tamen non defuerunt, qui sub nominibus
Apostolorum multa confingerent. Ex. August. epist. 48. Iustus Baronius de unit.
Eccles. Tract. de epistolis duab. Aug. page 129.
that no writings of any Bishop, although he were very famous, could be so
well preserved from the contagion of heretics, as might the holy Scriptures,
which were translated into many languages, and in the custody of so many
nations. Whereunto we may add the experience of the uncertainty of unwritten
Traditions, See above,. 9.
confessed by the examples of the Chiliasts, upon pretense of receiving them
from the Apostles; and of the Asians in the contentious manner of observation
of See above.
Easter, whilst that the West Church pleaded an original of their custom
from S. Peter, the East Church theirs from S. John. Join unto both these, the
known peremptorinesse of the Romish Church, which See above. 10.
has altered or abolished (either upon suspicion, that they were not true, or
upon supposition that they were not necessary:) and all these must needs teach
us, that the unwritten Traditions cannot deserve equal honor with the written
verities. But why do we contend to force a truth from consequences? which we
may have granted us by

The confessions of our learned Adversaries, confirming unto us the
sufficiency of Scripture.
SECT. 13.
22. What good is it that is required unto an (...), and full sufficiency in
any law, which issues not abundantly from this sacred fountain of the written
word? If we be to speak any thing concerning God the Author of all grace, De
Deo dicere non debemus, quod in sacra Scriptura no^ inuenitur, vel per verba,
vel per sensum. Aquin^^ Sum. part. 1. q. 36. art. 2. ad 1.
nothing may be said, (says their Aquinas) but what is found in Scripture: If
we seek to confute and convince most impudent and impious heretics, Non
aliter impios haereticos persrictae fronus poteramus conuinceie, nisi sacros
habe^mus codices, ex quibus clara veritas elucelceret Stella in Luc. 1. praf.
there is no other way (says their Stella) then by Scriptures. If we oppose
our selves against the spiritual tyranny of Antichrist, Omn^no nulla res
aduersus Antichrist^ ty^annidem Athletas Christi melius armabit, quam coelestis

nothing is more invincible (says their Jesuit Acosta) then the authority of
Scripture. If we examine the differences of Churches, and would discern the
true from the false, ^leganter sane etc. Salmero^ Ies. See above. 3. commending
the saying of the author of the imperfect work of S. Chrysostom.
the only means (says their Jesuit Salmeron) is by Scriptures. If we be
assembled in Council to debate questions of faith, and would be resolved,

then (says their Pictauius, at the Council of Trent) the only judge of all
matters of religion is the sacred Scripture; and Hoc demum est eruditionis and

not to define any thing but by Scripture, it is (says their Erasmus) the true
property of divine learning.

43 In brief, what can Protestants say more for the prerogative of the holy
Scriptures, then to profess that which their Bishop Roffensis has confessed,
viz. that the Scripture is the Scriptura est quoddam conclaue veritatum omnium,
quae Christianis omnibus necellariae sunt Roffens. Episcopus, art. 37. aduersus

salvation, but only unto such as may be necessarily proved by Scriptures; or
to determine with their learned Bishop Espencaeus, that Scripturas si quid

God speaks in the Scriptures so plentifully, that he needs not to speak
unto us concerning any thing necessary for us, seeing all necessary doctrines
may be had in Scripture; or finally to conclude with S. Gregory alone (because
our Adversaries would have him seem to be our greatest Adversary,) that Qui

fortify this universal profession of all Protestants, which is (as has been
truly related by our Adversaries) that all necessary doctrines of faith, and
precepts of life are contained in Scripture, as in an exact Canon of all
Christian faith. Therefore

We conclude, by way of Appeal.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Faith of Dionysius and Hermes.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
13 Thirteenthly, it is confessed yet further in general concerning Dionysius
Areopagita and Hermes, who are holden most ancient and Apostolic, Of
Dionysius mention is made Act. 17. 34 and of Hermes Romans 16. 14.
namely that Dionysius in his foresaid writings which were above a thousand
years since (as D. Humfrey Humfreid. in Iesuitismi, part 2. rat. 5. page 513.
fine, and 514. initio, says: Hunc Areopagitam, Suidas, Michael Singel^^,
Gregorius Turonensis and alij, Pauli auditorem credunt fuisse illum scriptorem
coelestis and Ecclesiasticae Hierarchiae. And see before, Sect. 3. number. 4. lit
o.
confesses) publicly extant and alleged under his name.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First proving that the Author, whom they have called
the Apostolic Dionysius, is falsely so entitled, being indeed of a later, and
obscurer order, by the judgment of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
THese our Adversaries after their urgent questioning about particulars, do now
seek to engrosse most of their doctrines in the names of Dionysius Areopagita
and Hermes, whom they propound unto us as Authors, both ancient for time, and
for truth, in a manner, authentical. But do insist in Dionysius.

2 It is too great a presumption in our Rhemenses Annot. in Act. 17. Sunt opera
Dionysij Areopagitae. Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 7. Canisius Ies. in
initio Catechismi, in Patrum encomijs. Duraeus Ies. contra Whitacheru^, Rat. 6.

Adversaries, so boldly to proclaim the objected Author for that Dionysius
Areopagita, S. Paul's Scholar, who is mentioned in the Act. 17: for diverse of
their own Doctors (as their Senensis says) Alij quidem Catholici dubitant an
illius Dionysij opera sint, cuius titulo inseribuntur, vt refert Sixtus
Senensis Bibl. l. 6. a^not. 229. Incertu^ est, tum quia Hieronymus in Catalogo
de viris illustribus huius non meminit, tum quia Gregorius Pontifex non ausus

do doubt, whether this Author were that Dionysius unto whom these books are
ascribed, or no: amongst others Praefat. in problem. Alexandri Aphrodisij ad

3 And if they wish that our resolution may depend rather upon reasons, than
upon men's persons, it would be no hard matter to prove the inscription of that
work, viz. Areopagita, to be a counterfeit, especially by a consideration in
it self, in In libris de d^uinis nominibus citatur Clemens Stromateus, qui
tamen vixit annos 200. post aetatem Dionysij Erasmus Annot. in Act. 17.
citing (as their Valla notes) Clemens Stromateus, who lived two hundred
years after this Dionysius: and (to omit other arguments) by the silence of
many ages after his death, wherein there was no public notice taken of any
such writings, even until the 600 circuit of time, when yet S. Gregory seemed
to doubt of the Author. Whereunto our Quia D. Hieronymus lib. de viris
illustribus non meminit horum scriptorum. 2. quia Gregorius Magnus non ausus
est hos libros B. Dionysio asserere. Caietan. quo supra. Del'Rio a Jesuit has
professedly written a book, for proof that the Author of th^se books was
that ancient Areopagita: and in answer unto these objections* says: Nonnullos
alios Ecclesiasticos scriptores Hieronymum praetermisiste, vel quod diligentiam
eius fugerunt, vel quod vnus homo non potuit omnes nancisci vel nouisse, vel
omnium semper meminisse. etc. For the second member, or he could not, is
opposite unto a former could: which must argue negligence.
Adversary and Jesuit so answers, as that he may seem to accuse S. Ierom of
some negligence, as though when he purposely writ a catalogue illustrium
Scriptorum, that is, of famous writers, who succeeded after the Apostles unto
his time, he could have been either ignorant or forgetful of the most famous
Dionysius, if at that time any such work had been extant,

4 Again, they make S. Gregory only Dixit Gregorius [fertur,] quoniam Latinos
alloquebatur, quibus authoritas librorum nondum Latio donatorum satis adhuc
cognita, vel comperta non erat. And a little before: Gregorius satis clare
ostendit se proniorem esse in sententiam affirmatiuam, quandoquidem ex hoc
libro doctrinam suam (which is not true: see the Section following, out of
Ribera) confirmauit. Delrius Ies. Vindic. Areopag. cap. 6. And see above lit. i.
to incline rather unto their opinion. And to the end they may more authorize
the work by the excellency of the name of that Dionysius, they disgrace the
succeeding Churches, as being for many ages generally Id nunc superest
ambiguitatis, vix enim quibusdam credibile visum est, tot seculis B. Dionysij
Areopagitae tam clari and Apostolici viri libros occultari potuisse: causa
prima est Suidae, etc. Quia Catholici obtestatione Dionysij erant obstricti, ne
imperitae multitudini, sed solis doctis sua scripta quasi multorum capacitatem
excedentia, reuelarent: doctis autem paulatim deficientibus, -- for^an etiam
Hieronymus excellentissimu^ Areopagitam inter Ecclesiasticos seriptores* non
commemorauit: quia eius libros tanquam eminentes non putauit ad communem
notitiam deputatos, etc. Aliam causam reddit Anastasius Bibliothecarius, cum
testatur veram esse Graecorum sententiam prohibentium libros Dionysij per multa
secula occultatos, donec per quendam Petrum Romanum (vt author Maximus) ex
Bibliotheca Romanae Ecclesiae, quae fida semper custos fuit exemplarium
optimorum, deprompti, in G^aeciam fuerunt asportati, quos p^ius pauci Graeci
nouerant, Latini vix vlli. Del'rio, cap. 8.
so unlearned (as they say) that they were both ignorant, and incapable of the
matters contained in this work. Which answer we take to be no better then a
preuarication, and betraying of their cause. But who would not rather imitate
the negligence (as the Orator speaks in like case) of their more ancients,
then the obscure and violent diligence of these new deuisers? especially seeing
they seek to delude their Readers by the fained testimonies of D. Rainolds
notes the conjectures of some Romanists, who object Gregory Nazianzene, Origin
and Athanasius: he answers* Gregory Nazianzene does praise a certain
author, but names none: and that the witness of Origin also is forged,
because that that Origin makes mention of Arians and Manichees, who did arise
near 200. years after that ancient Origin. Rainolds conference with Heart,
page 417. To this may be added the testimony of their Sixtus Senensis
concerning Athanasius:
Gregory Nazianzene, Origin, and Liber vnus continens quaestiones 162.
Athanasio tribuitur, qui tamen Athanasij non videtur. Suspicor hunc ex varij^
fratrum scriptis collectum a studioso quopiam, qui in quaestione quarta

citat etiam Athanasium ipsum, and ab eo etiam sententiam diuersam profert.
Sixtus Senens. Biblioth. lib. 4. Tit. Athanasius.
Athanasius, as though by three counterfeit and suborned witnesses, they had
intended to prove one.

5 Wherefore we judge it to have been a point of sobriety in their Grocinus,
sometimes Diuinity-Reader in S. Paul's Church of London, when reading his
Lectures out of these works attributed unto Dionysius, Gulielmus Grocinus,
summus Theologus Londini in aede D. Paulo sacra enarrationem Hierarchiae
coelestis auspicaturus, meditata praefatione multum asserebat hoc Dionysij opus
fuisse, vehementer destomachans in eorum impudentiam qui dissentirent: at idem
priusquam dimidium operis confecisset, ac gustum attentius cepisset, ingenue
coram auditorio fassus est, verso calculo, sibi non videri id opus Dionysij
Areopagitae fuisse. Erasmus annot in Act. 17.
although at the first he noted every one of impudency, who should dare to
deny them to be the proper writings of Dionysius Areopagita; yet before he had
half finished his Lectures, he confessed ingenuously before his auditorie,
that he thought them not to be the works of that learned Dionysius. But we
leave these and At the time of the death of the blessed Virgin, at our Divines
of Rhemes report, and at S. Dennys, and after him Damascene reports, all the
Apostles then dispersed into diverse nations, were miraculously brought
together, saving Thomas, who came the third day after to Jerusalem to honor
her divine departure and funeral, as the said Dennys writes, who says, that
himself, S. Timothy, and S. Hierotheus were present. M. Heart against D.
Rainolds, page 414. and the Rhemists annot. in Act. 1. 14. Now the blessed
Virgin died the fifteenth year after Christ's ascension, say the Rhemists. D.
Rainolds answers truly out of Act. 15. 4. and 16. 1. and 17. 34. it was
seventeen or eighteen years after Christ's ascension before S. Dennys knew
Christ. Ibid. page 419.
other their contradictions about the Author: and now examine the authority of
the work, proving,

That the books which carry the name of Dionysius, are not so absolute, but
that they may admit exception; by the judgment of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
6 If it were granted that this Author was very ancient, who (as Doctor By
likelihood Bishop of Alexandria. M. Fulke against the Rhemish Test ament in 2 Thessalonians. 2. Sect. 19. He does not affirm him to be so ancient, neither could he,
Origin living about the 290. when as this Dionysius was not extant in the days
of Athanasius, about the year 340.
Fulke but only supposes) might have been for name sake Dionysius
Alexandrinus, the scholar of Origin: yet are we to consider, that these works
carry not in them the pretended authority, that we ought by them to be
directed in faith: because their subject matter is especially the celestial
Hierarchy, or distinct orders of Angels, and powers, and dominions celestial.
Now we know that S. Paul called such points 2. Cor. 12. 4. (...), -- Nefas est
homini ea loqui.
things not able to be uttered, and which ought not to be spoken of unto man:
and shall we think that his supposed scholar Dionysius durst adventure to
reveal other like obscurities? Let them imagine this, who know not that the
ancient Father Nec rehnquentes nos eloquia Domini and Mosen, and reliquos
Prophetas qui veritatem pra con^^uerunt, his credere oportet nihil sanum
dicentibus, instabilia autem delirantibus: dicant nobis quae sit rerum
inuisibilium natura, ena^re^t numerum Angeloru^, and ordine^ Archangelorum,
demonstrent thronorum Sacramenta, and doceant diuersit^t ^s dominationum,
principat^um, potestatum, atque virtutum. Sed non habetis dicere. Irenaus lib.
2. cap. 55.
Irenaus accounts it a matter of dotage to undertake a manifestation of the
nature of things invisible, as of the number of Angels, order of Arc^angels,
diversities of dominations, powers, and virtues. Which kind of presumption And
S. Augustine Enchirid. ad Laurent. cap. 58. confesses that he knows not such
mysteries, saying, Dicant qui poslunt, si modo probare possunt quod dicunt.
S. Augustine seems to note, when he says of such speculators: Let them tell
me such things, who can; yet so, that they be able to prove what they tell me.

7 Or if yet their judgment seem not fully controllable, let them consult
with their own learned Jesuit Ribera, who can inform them, that Multieam
sententiam (concerning the office of Seraphins) vnius authoritate Dionysij
lequuntur: verum grauissimi Patres Graeci and Latini cum sequi noluerunt, --
Gregorius Papa Dionysij authoritate noluit acquiescere, ne forte sacrae
Scripturae verbis videretur aduersari; si rem tam abstrutam, ratione nostra
meti^i velimus, saepe multumque aber^abimus. Si ^utem principatus dicuntur quia
etc. -- quod vero quidam existimant, Dionysium haec a Paulo Apostolo accepisle,
nec ipse vnquam dixit, non taciturust antum authorem in re tam subti^i, and
obscura, nec ipsi probant; imo ita saepe loquuntur, vt non certa sed probabilia
dicere se facile iudicent. Ribera Ies. com. in Heb. 1. number. 99 etc.
albeit many are carried with the opinion of Dionysius in a doctrine, namely,
concerning the office of Seraphins; yet (says he) many most grave Fathers,
both Greek and Latin, would not accord unto him; yea, and S. Gregory would not
rest herein, lest in so doing, he might seem to dissent from the holy
Scriptures. As for the names of Angels, he says, that If Dionysius had learned
them of S. Paul, he would not have concealed it: and concludes thereof, as of
a matter doubtful and coniecturall. We trust then our Apologists will hold us
excusable, if herein we choose rather to be the scholars of S. Gregory in not
believing any testimonies of Dionysius, fu^ther than they do agree with
Scriptures. Nevertheless if we should deal so b^untifully with our
Adversaries, as to allow of the testimony of this Dionysius, what would the
Apologists prove from him?

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEALF.
Proving that the particulars alleged from Dionysius, are not answerable unto
the Apologists pretense.
SECT. 3.
8 For first, Prayer for the dead, which was used by Dionysius, (as our D.
Fulke has learnedly observed) That Dionysius does not speak of prayer for the
dead, in the Liturg^e, and that which he delivers, he expounds afterward,
not to be a supplication, but rather an interpretation of the mercy of God
already performed upon the party departed. M. Fulke annot. in 2 Thessalonians. 2.
page 667. Therefore did the Apologists insert this, without our Author. See
this also proved above, chap. 8. Sect. 2.
was not a supplication, to receive mercy, but an interpretation, or
acknowledgement of mercy received.

9 Doubtless, if that either need of prayer for the dead to be delivered from
torment, or else the power of prayer to advance them in bliss, had been taught
by Dionysius, their Cardinal Bellarmine (who Bellarm. lib. 4. de verbo Dei,
cap. 7.
labors to authorize this Author, and cites him as often as his cause will
permit) would not have (as he See his whole dispute de Purgatorio.
does) pretermitted so necessary a witness in this case.

10 Besides, the place objected will answer for it self. It is true that
Dionysius in describing the order of the Christian funerals, says, that the
Bishop or Minister does Accedens diuinus Antistes ipsi mortuo sancte precatur,
atque post precationem cum ipse salutat, and ordine omnes qui adsunt: precibus
quidem a diuina benignitate conte^dit, vt omnia peccata, quae humana
fragilitate commissa sunt, ei qui excessit e vita remittat, and eum in regionem
viuorum educat. -- Verum fortasse dices, cur id petat Antistes? -- Hoc statuo
cum scriptis diuinis, Sanctorum preces in hac vita perutiles esse, si quis been
animo constitutus adeat Sanctum aliquem, and petat vt adiuuet -- neglige^te
diuina humanitate pro benignitate sua, maculas, quas humana fragilitas
contraxit. Answering to the question: -- Haec Antistes scit promissa esse a
scriptis diuinis quae vera sunt, petit autem vt ea eueniant, and dentur ijs,
qui recte vixerunt sancta praemia, ita tamen vt ad Dei imitationem bonitatis
similitudine formetur, aliorum que dona vt sua beneficia poscat, and vera
promissa sciat futura, eisque qui adsunt quasi interpres exponat, ea quae ipse
ex sancto more and instituto repetat, plane euentura esse ijs, qui in diuina
vita hinc migrauerint. Paulo post: -- Petit Antistes quae a Deo promissa sunt
and plane concedenda: in quo and animi sui constitutionem, quae bonitatis
diuinae speciem prae se fert, Deo, cui boni chari sunt, declarat: and eis qui
adsunt vt interpres, munera and bona, quae sanctis euentura sunt, exponit.
Dionysius Areopag. Eccles. Hierarch. Haec quidem.
pray for remission unto the dead, for the escapes committed only by humane
frailty: but because he had taught, that every holy and faithful servant of
God, did immediately attain unto the joys of heaven, he moves this question,
Why then does the Minister pray to God to help him, and what can be the use of
such prayers? For resolution hereof he first shows, that God of his mercy
does according to his promise and gracious bounty, pardon such infirmities:
and in the end concludes, that by that manner of prayer the Minister does
nothing else, in regard of God, but express his affection of charity unto him
who is dear in Gods sight, and his faith in auouching the truth of Gods
promise, in declaring that he will certainly accept of the soul of the
departed: and in respect of the men there present, he does expound unto them
the certainty of that hope. So that it may rather be called a protestation
then a supplication, as the circumstances of the testimony do sufficiently
prove.

11 That which may make this question questionless, is to observe that
Dionysius in the same contemplation does according unto Scriptures, range the
souls departed into but two companies, wicked and godly; and of these later he
does profess, that Qui vero sancti vixerunt -- Dei vera certaque spe promissa
Dei spectantes, diuinae laetitiae pleni ad mortis extremum tanquam ad finem
certaminum proficiscuntur. -- Verum Deus prohibeat ne quis sanctus vir in
huiusmodi errores incidat, sed sciant se totos iucundam gratam que requiem esse
adepturos, -- and diuina voluptate complentur propterea quod mutationem in
peius iam non timeant, sed aeternorum bonorum, quae adepti sunt, certo sciant
aeternam iam sibi fore possessionem. -- Propinqui eius qui mortuus est, pro
iure propinquitatis and morum similitudine beatum cum dicunt, quod ad victoriae
finem peroptato peruenerit and victoriae authori gratias cum cantu agunt, and
propterea sibi similem requiem optant. Dionys. Eccles. Hierarch. Perionio

of Dionysius above, cap. 8.. 2.
when they are dying, they are filled with divine comfort in their assured and
certain hope, that when they yield up the ghosts, they shall not fall into a
worse state, but possess eternal life. But when? Now when they die, says
Dionysius; that is (as Cardinal Bellarmine expounds it) Nota dicere
Dionysium a morte hominis statim consequi immortalitatem. Bellarm. lib. 1. de
Beat. Sanct. cap. 4.. Secundus sit.
immediately after death. Upon the truth of which profession, the faithful
Christians, who do honest and honor his funerals, do use to congratulate his
state of victory with Psalms of joy, and wish that they may be made partakers
of the same rest. Which argues no less difference between the specified
profession of Dionysius, and the now Romish, then there is between doubtfulnes
in the soul departing, and certain and assured hope between fear and full
joy: or as between the doleful sighs of the bystanders, and their joyous
songs of deliverance: and consequently as between a Purgatory torment, and a
glorious and happy triumph.

12 Of Monks we have spoken at large, where the Romish order of Monastical
life, is confessed not to be so old as the age of Dionysius Areopagita, by many
years.

13 Howsoever, the Traditions which they would derive from Dionysius (as we may
perceive by the Apologists account) are neither many: nor yet (if they be
rightly conceived) very weighty. The principal matter is that which they
allege concerning Chrisme and the Sacraments: which we are to discuss, and
show,

That the now doctrine of the Romish Church concerning their seven Sacraments,
is not from the Catholic faith of the ancient Fathers, or of the alleged
Dionysius.
SECT. 4.
14 What a proper and true Sacrament is in the Romish doctrine, their Costerus
has defined, saying, that Sacramentum est diuinae and inuisibilis gratiae
externum signum and visibile, a Christo institutum, vt per id quisque Dei
gratiam accipiat atque sanctificationem vi ipsius sacramenti. C^sterus Ies.
Enchirid.
it is an outward and visible sign of some divine and invisible grace: by
virtue of the which Sacrament the Receiver obtains grace and sanctification.

15 We will not put our Adversaries to prove by Scripture, that either their
seven Sacraments are properly Sacraments, or else that the number of true
Sacraments is just seven: because when they are brought unto this trial, we
cannot but pity their See a taste in the next Section.
perplexities. For their inferences are little better then was that argument
used by their Patriarch of Venice in the Council of Trent, Dominica Quadrages.

who from that history of Christ [feeding so many thousands with five loves and
two fishes,] which make up in all, the number of seven, and whereof Christ
said, [It is sufficient,] did (as our Gentilletus reports) conclude, that
from the sense of that place the Sacraments of the Church must be fully seven.
Our present charge is to seek the voice of Antiquity.

16 Herein our Adversaries seem to be confident, saying, that Fundatur autem
haec veritas in Ecclesiastica Traditione, quae docet Christum illa septem
iustituisse; and non plura. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. disp. 12.. 1.
the truth of this assertion, viz. the Sacraments are neither more nor fewer
then seven, is grounded upon Ecclesiastical Tradition, which teaches that
Christ did institute these seven. But being required to prove the exact
necessity of this number of seven out of the Fathers, they answer, that they
are not to be charged to show Non debere aduersarios petere a nobis vt
ostendamus in Scripturis aut Patribus nomen septenarij numeri Sacramentorum:
Scriptura enim and Patres non scripserunt Catechismum. Bellar. lib. 2. de
effect. Sacram. cap. 24.
either out of Scriptures, or out of Fathers the name of seven Sacraments,
because the Fathers writ no Catechismes. We exact not the name of the number
seven, but only as two and three make five, so would we have demonstration
that any of the Fathers in any place, writing of the Sacraments of the new
Testament, did give any certain intimation of the number of seven? They
answer, that although this set number of seven, is not intimated by any Father,
Satis est quod Patres in varijs locis, aut certe varij eiusdem aetatis Patres
omnium septe^ Sacramentorum alicubi meminerint. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Sacram. in
genere, cap. 27. Tametsi Patres non omnino numerent simul in aliquo loco
Sacramenta septem; tamen etc. Greg. Valen. Ies. lib. de numero Sacram. cap. 1.
yet must we be content, that here and there they have mentioned them. Which is
known to be a lame and halting consequence, to any one who remembers that the
Fathers used to extend the name of Sacrament unto many things which our
Adversaries themselves know to be no proper Sacraments; as for example, August
lib. 2. de pecea. merit. and remiss. cap. 26 Cibum sanctificatum, qui
Catechumenis dabatur Sacramentum appellat. Et lib. 4. de Symb. cap. 1.
Exorcismos Sacramenta appellat: lib. 19. contra Faustum Manichaeum, cap. 14.

objected, whereunto afterward he answers, that the word Sacrament among the
Fathers was used largo modo.

August. de bono coniugali, cap. 18. Sacramentum plurium vxorum significat
multitudinem omnium terrarum Deo subiectam.
Polygamie, or multitude of wives, which the Patriarchs did enjoy, S. Augustine
does term by the name of Sacraments. Why then should we not rather be directed
by the testimonies of Fathers, where (as our August. epist. 118. lib. 3. doctr.
Christ. cap. 9. Ambros. lib. de. Sacram. Justinius Martyr Apol. 2. Tertull. lib
4. contra Marc. cap. 34. Cyril. de Cateches. Kemnitius Exam. Conc. Trid. de
Sacram. part 2.
Authors have observed) the Fathers entreating more precisely of the Sacraments
of the new Testament, do only express two, Baptism, and the Eucharist:
amongst others, S. Ambrose in his Treatise properly written of the Sacraments,
and S. Cyril in his book entitled a Catechism?

17 As for their Dionysius, it may be that Protestants (answering unto him as
he was objected by the Romanists, to confirm six Sacraments,) might generally
answer (not as confessing, but only as supposing that he taught six) by
denying his authority: for their own learned Cardinal Dionysius in Eccles.
Hierarch. Tractar de Bapt. and Euchar. -- Item de consecratione olei, de ordin.
Clericorum -- caetera tria omisit, -- nec tamen ignorauit sacram Poenit.
Bellar. lib. 2. de effect. Sacram cap. 27.. Ad.
Bellarmine can find in him but five, and we think he would not have willingly
missed of his account. And yet of those five he might well abate one, if not
three; for Dionysius does no more esteem the consecration by oil to be a
Sacrament, then he does the Mentioned by Dionysius in the same place.
anointing with oil the corpse of the dead, in testimony of the hope of
resurrection: which ceremony the Church of Rome does neither use, nor Quae sine
dubio Sacramentum non erat, sed pia quaedam caeremonia. Suarez Ies. Tom. 4.
disp. 39. sect. 1. number. 10.
approve for a Sacrament. So that by their consequence taken from the authority
of Dionysius, to prove six, they are chargeable to allow an eighth; so
unreasonable is their reason taken from this witness.

18 What then is the greatest strength of the Romish defense for seven? Hanc
veritatem insinuauerat Conc. Florentinum, expressius vero Trid Conc. Sess. 7.
cap. 1. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. disp. 12. Sect. 1.. Secundo.
The Council of Florence (say they) did insinuate this truth: and the Council
of Trent did expressly define it. Upon this foundation depends their last
resolution of seven, Ergo Id quod Ecclesia Christi de numero Sacramentorum
tradit, id sine omni dubitatione credendum est: sed Ecclesia tradit non esse
vel plura vel pauciora. Ergo. Greg. de Valen. Ies. lib. de numero Sacram. cap.
1.
we must believe that there are neither more, nor fewer then seven. But if not
the silence of ancient Fathers, who have never taught this, yet the ingenuous
confessions of their own brethren must somewhat prejudice their conclusion.
Hear therefore

The Romish number of seven proper Sacraments abated, by the confession of our
learned Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
19 Let us remember, when we speak of Sacraments, what we have in question:
first we talk of Sacraments properly so called: for if we should speak of
improper Sacraments, which are mentioned of ancient Fathers, our Adversary
will not deny, that not only seven, but even So many as there be signs of
holy things.
seventy seven Sacraments might be named. Next, in all proper Sacraments they
and we See above. 3.
require, that they have their institution from Christ, and a power of
conferring sanctifying grace upon every rightly constituted and prepared
receiver: and of this kind they have propounded fully and only seven, to be
believed under the danger of Anathema and curse upon every soul that shall
except against any one of them.

20 Now then let them but give us leave to believe their own Authors, and we
shall easily manifest, that this their profession concerning the number of
Sacraments was not held Catholic, no not in the Church of Rome, until more
then a thousand years after Christ: for Non temere quemquam repeties ante
Petrum Lombardum, qui certu^ aliquem ac definitum numeru^ Sacramentorum
statuerat. Et de his septem non omnes quidem Scholastici ^que proprie
Sacramenta vocaba^t. Cassander Consult* art. 13.
until the days of Peter Lombard (who lived about the year 1151,) you shall
scarce find any author (says their Cassander) who set down any certain and
definite number of Sacraments: neither did all the Schoolmen call all those
seven, proper Sacraments. We may try the truth of this general assertion by
three particular instances.

21 First, two of their ancient School, to wit, Confirmationem non esse a
Christo institutam, falsa opinio suit, and post Ecclesiae declarationes plane
est haeretica. -- Alensem eode^ tempore refutauit Albertus magous, and Thomas.
Greg. Vale^. Ies. de number. Sacr. cap. 3.. Verum.
Alensis and Holcottus negat Confirmationem esse proprie Sacramentum. Cassander
quo supra.
Holcot, were licenced in their times to See above. 3.
deny that confirmation was from Christ's institution: and we know that (as
their Council of Trent has truly defined) * only Christ can institute a
proper Sacrament.

22 Secondy, Matrimony is numbered among the seven, which their Counsel of Si
quis dixerit etc. Conc. Trid. Sess. 24. can. 1.
Trent has discerned to be properly a Sacrament, instituted of Christ, and
conferring grace. Nevertheless their profound Doctor Ex nostris Catholicis
vnus est Durandus, qui Matrimonium Sacramentum non nisi aequiuoce dici posse
disputat. Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram. cap. 5.. Quae etiam.
Durand (as Cardinal Bellarmine testifies,) judged it not to be properly a
Sacrament: and both he and the chief master of the Romish School taught, that
De Matrimonio non modo Petrus Lombardus negauit in eo conferri gratiam, sed
long post cum Durandus disert* inquit, non esse Matrimonium vniuoce
Sacramentum, sicut alia nouae legis Sacramenta; nam nec confer gratiam non
habenti: non esse itaque proprie and stricte dictum Sacramentum. in 4. did.
26. q. 3. Cassander Consult. art. 13.
it has not the virtue of conferring of grace. We omit other particulars, and
give an instance of the fundamental stay of our Adversaries faith

23 Thirdly therefore Extreme unction is questioned of: the Tride^t Decree does
fasten a curse upon every one that Si quis dixerit Extremam vnctionem non esse
proprie Sacramentum a Christo institutum, and a B. Iacobo (cap. 5.)
promulgatum, Anathema sit. Conc. Trid. Sess. 14.
shall deny it to be properly a Sacrament, which was instituted by Christ: but
why do they believe that it was instituted by Christ? Si non fuisset a Christo
institutum, ex hoc lequeretur non esse verum Sacramentum. Suarez Ies. Tom. 4.
disp. 39. Sect. 2. number. 1. See Costerus above Sect. 3.
Because (say they) if it were not ordained by Christ, it cannot be accounted
properly a Sacrament. Which they profess (as they say) Sacramentum hoc fuisse
a Christo institutu^m, semper fuit communior opinio Scholasticorum, and nunc
est de fide definita in Conc. Trid. Sess. 14. Can. 1. in particulari de hoc
Sacramento, and in gener. Sess. 7. can. 1. Nam omnia Sacramenta nouae legis
sunt a Christo instituta, Suarez Tom. 4. disp. 39. Sect. 2.
according unto the common opinion of Divines, and the late definition of their
foresaid Council of Trent: notwithstanding they do confess, that in their
more ancient School Cardinal Hugo de sancto Victore, whom for the excellency
of his judgment See the Catalogue of Authors before these books.
they have called the Augustine of his age; and Peter Lombard, surnamed by them
the Sea the Catalogue of Authors before these books.
Master of their Schools; and Bonauenture, who for his exquisite judgment is

Seraphicalll Doctor, together with Alensis and Altisiodorus, the singular

did not think this Extreme unction to have been instituted by Christ; and
consequently, (although unwittingly) have they denied it to be a Sacrament, as
says their Jesuit Suarez.

24 Necessary therefore it is, (according to the definition of their last
Council) they prove the institution thereof from Christ, before it may be
presumed to be a right and perfect Sacrament. The first place of Scripture,
which they produce, is Mark, 6. 13; where the Apostles are said to have
[annointed many sick, and healed them:] which place their Jesuit Et vngebant
multos oleo, and sanabant, Marc. 6. 13.] Vbi Sacramentu^ est, si hic non est?

Sacramentum, aut malign, si haereticus, aut impudenter, si Catholicus est,

Maldonate so confidently teaches to prove the Sacrament of Extreme unction,
that he dare ask, Where is it proved, if not in this text? which was also the
opinion of Hoc testimonio vtuntur ad hoc dogma comprobandum, Waldensis Tom. 2.

and since the doctrine of Protestants, whom he forbeareth to smite, lest (as he
says) he might hit his own fellows: among whom we may reckon their Cardinal

25 Their next place is from S. James, chap. 5. wherein whosoever shall not
confess that the Sacrament of Extreme unction is published, is by the same See
above at the letter, g.

Caiet. in Iac. 5.
Cardinal doubted not to publish in his books, that the Sacrament of Extreme
unction cannot be proved by that text, either from the words, or from the
effects, which by that unction do properly concern the healing of bodily
diseases. Which may be confirmed by the Olim haec vnctio non vt hod^e fere fit,

confessed practice of antiquity, as appears in the form of the Roman
anointing, and of other more ancient examples, which teach, that the
anointing was anciently used for the restoring of the sick unto health, and
not, as it is now, referred unto the time that a man is pass all hope of
recovery. Now then,

We conclude.
SECT. 6.
26 Consider what has been confessed by our Adversaries, viz. that the
objected See. 1.
Author, named Dionysius, is not so current, nor his. 2.
authority so absolute, nor his. 4. 5.
particulars of prayer for the dead, Monks, Traditions, and Sacraments so
pertinent, as our Adversaries would pretend: whose now article of. 4.

confession of their Doctors to be but newly imposed, especially in these. 5.
three, Confirmation, Matrimony, and Extreme unction. So may we perceive the
inualiditie, if not iniquity of the Romish claim. How much more sensible will
this be, if we should instance from Dionysius, against the Romish doctrine of
multitude of ceremonies, private Mass, proper Sacrifice, Purgatory torment,
prayers in an unknown tongue, and other controuerted Articles, as they are now
professed in the Roman Church? From Dionysius they fly unto Hermes.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Proving the unworthiness of the authority of this
book; from the testimonies of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
BEfore we speak of the faith of Hermes, necessary it is, that we show what
may be our faith of this Hermes, which book the Apologists contend to prove to
have been in the Church, if not of Canonical, yet at least of Ecclesiastical
authority. But what has been, and what ought to be our estimation hereof, the
Apologists might have learned, if not from the judgment of our Scultetus and
other Protestants by them alleged, who account of them to be Libri vt venusti,
ita fabulosi sunt, etc. Scultetus in the place cited by the Apologists.
fine, but fabulous, yet from the censure of their own best approved Doctors.

2 First, Sixtus Senensis examining the credit of this book of Hermes, alias
Pastor, says, that Hoc opus olim public in quibusdam Graeciae Ecclesijs
legebatur ad institutionem eorum, qui primis ad fidei institut. instruebantur
clementis; multique veteres Patres eius testimonijs ad dogmatum confirmationem
vsi sunt: post quo^um tempora authoritas huius libri paulatim defecit, and a
Gelasio demum inter Scripturas dubiae fidei reiecta est, vt arbitror, ad
haereticorum subuersionem, qui inde execrabilium dogmatum praesidia assumebant.
Sixtus Senensis Bibl. lib 2. Tit. Hermes.
the authority hereof decayed, and was accounted by Pope Gelasius among the
Authors of suspected credit: which Gelasius did, as I think, (says Senensis)
for the subversion of those heretics, who from that book did gather strength
for the maintenance of their execrable opinions.

3 Secondly, Cardinal Liber Hermae seu Hermetis, qui inscriptus est Pastor,
quibu^dam antiquis optime notus ac probatus fuit, -- nouit eum atque frequenter
citat Origenes, qui tam^n eum a nonnullis contemni tradit, vt plane appareat,
hand integram solidamque fidem apud omnes meruisse. (n. 4.) Quod autem ad
Latinos pertinet, sic eis liber innotuit, vt tamen eum ipsi inter eorum
Apocryphorum genera adnumerarint, quae legi in Ecclesia possint, non tamen
citari deb^re ad fidem Catholicam astruendam: hac enim censura a maioribus
fuisse notatum Tertullianus affirmat: ipse autem postea ipsum respuit, quod
reciperet moechi poenitentiam contra pleudoparacleti doctrinam; ait enim, [Sed
cred^rem tibi, si Scriptura pastoris, quae sola moechos amat, diuino inst:
umento meruisset incidi: si non ab omni Concilio Ecclesiarum etiam vestrarum

etc. Cardinalis Baronius anno Christi 159. number. 5. 6.
Baronius says of the same book, that Origin indeed cited it, but confesses
also that it was contemned of some in his time: which the Latin Fathers
reckoned in the number of those Apocryphal books that were read for
instructions in manners, but not for confirmation of any matter of faith: which
Tertullian afterward did abhor, calling it adulterous: which S. Prosper, in
his dispute with one, who thereby would have confirmed an error, did esteem of
no authority: and from which the Arrian heretics (as witnesses Athanasius)
did confirm their heresies.

4 Our third witness is Cardinal Vox Apocryphus Graeca est, and rem occultam
and reconditam significat. -- Porro Ecclesiastici scriptores non semper hanc
vocem eodem modo vsurpant: interdum vocant Apocryphas scripturas eas, quas non
est certum an sint ^anonicae and diuinae, etiamfi satis constet nullos in ijs
errores inueniri: sic Hieronymus in Galeato, etc. Interdum vocant Apocryphos
eos libros, qui errores admixtos habent: sic vtitur hae voce Origin. Hieron.
August. quam significationem sequutus Gelasius in decreto de libtis
Ecclesiasticis: eos libros vocat Apocryphos, qui sunt editi ab authoribus
haereticis, vel certe suspectis. -- Nec minus Apocryphus censendus est liber
Hermetis, qui inscribitur Pastor, tametsi enim eum diuinitus inspiratum
putauerit Origenes, and ex eo testimonia proferant Tertull. and alij, tamen
disertis verbis eum a Canone reijcit Gelasius in decreto de libris
Ecclesiasticis. Bellar. lib. 1. de verbo Dei cap. 20.. Igitur vox. and. Nec
minus librum Hermetis, qui ins^^bitur Pastor. disertis ver bis a canone reijcit
Gelasius, -- and Athanasius, -- and idem etiam Athanasius in libro de decretis
Nicaenae Synodi, and Theodoretus Arianos, qui ex hoc libro testimonia petebant,
dicunt ex libro non canonico testimonia petijs^e. Bellar. lib. 1. de verbo Dei,
cap. 20.
Bellarmine, who testifies, that whereas the word Apocrypha has a double
sense, either to signify books, which are not fully divine and Canonical,
albeit they contained no error; or else such books, wherein there was an
admixture of errors: in this sense Gelasius in his Decree concerning books
Ecclesiastical, did call the books Apocryphal, the authors whereof he either
judged to have been heretics, or at least suspected; among which he nu^breth
Hermes. Which the Decree it self, made by Quae ab haereticis, sieve
schismaticis conscripta vel praedicata sunt, nulla tenu^ r^cipit Ecclesia
Catholica Romana; nam e quibus pauca, quae ad memoriam venerunt, and quae a
Catholicis vita^da sunt, credimus esse subdenda imprimis etc. -- Item and libet
Pastoris Apocryphus, and libri omnes quos fecit Lenticius discipulus diabolt,
Apocryphi etc. And Gelasius concludes his decree, concerning these books,
thus: Haec and omnia his similia etc. non solum repudiata, verumetiam ab omni
Romana Ecclesia eliminata, at que cum suis authoribus and sequacibus cum
Anathematis indissolubili vinculo confitemur esse damnata. Gelasius Papa apud
Gratian. did. 15. cap. 3.
Gelasius against it, does fully discover, in the end concluding thus; All such
like we confess not only to be refused of the Roman Church, but also to be
cast out and abandoned, and finally with all the authors and allowers of them,
to be with an inseperable curse of an Anathema utterly condemned.

5 Thus (we see) how far these Apologists have been transported with
prejudice, the nource of all errors; who (that they might draw Protestants
into the suspicion of contumacy, for rejecting the authority of an author
entitled Hermes, or Pastor,) have honored him with an opinion of S. Paul's
scholar, and have approved his authority, as being at the least,
Ecclesiastical; never regarding either the exact judgment of Protestants in
refusing it, or else the confessions of their own most authorized Doctors in
commending the wisdom of some ancients, who have contemned it as false and
adulterous: but notwithstanding such evidence, do by the sentences of this
Author piece out a part of their artificial Catholic Apology. Now what shall
it advantage them if Protestants have granted that there is in this book
Popery, wherein their own Romanists confess so many seeds of heresy to be
found?

6 Nevertheless, in the books of Hermes, which are put into their Bibliotheke
of holy Fathers, few of their particulars can be found; in so much as our
greatest Bellarmine in these several controversies, where he seeks to prove
these particulars of Freewill, etc. although he cite Dionysius Areopagita for
votum continentiae; yet the authority of this Hermes he pretermitteth in these
questions.
Adversary, when he would have every part of Popery seem to be most absolute,
yet has not confirmed almost any one point by any testimony of this Hermes.
The Apologists now hasten to the last point, but with what speed, the premises
may teach us to guess, and the sequel will accordingly demonstrate.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of their last Argument from Antiquity: taken from the Rule of
S. Augustine.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
14 Fourteenthly, whereas the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury does against
Cartwright learnedly and truly urge this general rule or proof of Apostolic
doctrine, saying, M. Whitgift in his defense, etc. page 351.
For so much as the original and beginning of these names, Metropolitan,
Archbishop, etc. such is their antiquity, cannot be found so far as I have
read, it is to be supposed they have their original from the Apostles
themselves. For as I remember S. Augustine has this rule in his 118. Epistle.
In so much as he yet further says in proof of this rule, M. Whitgift vbi
supra, page 352.
It is of credit with the writers of out time, namely with M. Zuinglius, M.
Calvin, and M. Gualter, and surely I think no learned man does dissent from
them.

It is now by the premises made more then evident, that the several doctrines
of our faith, are according to this rule, no less free from all noted and
known beginning since the Apostles times, then are the other foresaid
doctrines of Metropolitanes, and Archbishops: a thing so manifest, that M.
Cartwright (though our great adversary) doubts not yet further to
acknowledge the same, saying therefore of this very rule in plain words, See
M. Cartwrights words in M. Whitgifts foresaid defense etc. page 352. initio.
That thereby a window is open to bring in all Popery: and M. Cartwright
alleged ibid. page 103. paulo ante med
I appeal (says he) to the judgment of all men, if this be not to bring in
Popery again, to allow of S. Augustines saying: etc. So evidently do our own
learned Adversaries, confirm and prove our foresaid Catholic Religion,
whereto we were so many ages since converted, to be undoubtedly Apostolic.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
WEll may we think that the Apologists by See before in the question of
Traditions, Chap. 25.
twice instancing in this argument, have put therein a double confidence. Which
whether it proceed from the strength of good consequence, and not rather from
the weakness of their judgment, we permit unto the equal censure of our
Reader, after that we have discussed these four points. 1. what was the rule
of S. Augustine delivered, which is the subject of this dispute. 2. what is the
argument of our reverend Bishop from that rule. 3. the inference of M.
Cartwright from that argument. 4 the collection of the Apologists upon that
inference, and conclusion. To begin at the first,

The rule of S. Augustine.
SECT. 2.
2 S. Augustine, who consonantly unto other Fathers had pronounced of See
before Chap. 25.
all things necessary to be believed, that they are contained in Scripture,
(whereby is avouched the sufficiency of Scripture in all doctrines of faith,) he
in the place now objected (being the 118. Epistle ad Ianuarium,) delivers
rules concerning only the rites and ceremonies of the Church: whereof some
were then used universally in all Christian Churches, as namely the solemn and
yearly celebrations of the days of Christ's passion, resurrection, and
ascension, etc. Of this kind of custom he gives this Axiom; Illa autem quae
non scripta sunt sed tradita custodimus, quae quidem toto terrarum orb
obseruantur, dantur intelligi vel ab ipsis Apostolis, vel plenarijs Concilijs,
quorum est in Ecclesia celebetrima authoritas, commendata atque statuta
retineri, sicut quod Dominici passio, and resurrectio, and ascensio in coelum,
and aduentus de coelo Spiritus sancti, anniuersaria solennitate celebrantur:
and si quid aliud quod seruatur ab vniuersa quacunque se diffundit Ecclesia.
August. epist. 118. ad Ianuar. cap. 1. and paulo post. cap. 5. Similiter enamsi
quod horum tota per orbem frequentat Ecclesia, nam hoc quin ita faciendum sit,
insolentissimae est insaniae. Ibidem.
Whatsoever is not written, but is delivered by Tradition, and is observed in
the Churches throughout the world, is to be understood to have been ordained
either by the Apostles, or else by general Councels, which are of most
renowned authority in the Church.

3 Besides these universal Traditions, Alia vero quae per loca terrarum
regionesque variantur, sicuti est quod alij ieiunant Sabbato, alij vero non,
alij quotidie communicant corpori Dominico, alij certis diebus accipiunt. --
Totum hoc genus liberas habet obseruationes, nec vlla alia disciplina melior
est graui prudentique Christiano, quam vt eo modo agar, quo agere viderit
Ecclesiam, ad quamcunque deuenerit: quod enim neque contra fidem, neque contra
bonos mores iniungitur, indifferenter est habendum, and pro eorum, inter quos
viuitur, societate est seruandum. -- Ambrosius respondet, cum, inquit, Romam
venio, ieiuno Sabbato* cum bic sum, non ieiuno: sic tu ad quamcunque forte
Ecclesiam veneris, eius mor^m serua, si cuiquam non vis esse scandalo, nec
quenquam tibi. Ibid. cap. 2.
other customs and ceremonies there be (says he) which be particularly
observed in some particular countries, as somewhere to fast on the Sabbath, but
otherwhere it is otherwise. And concerning these he has another rule, to wit,
Whenever any man shall come into any particular Church and country, where any
custom or ceremony is enjoined, which is not contrary either unto says, or
good manners, he ought in wisdom to observe the rites there used, thereby to
avoid a double scandal, both of himself unto others, and of others unto
himself. These be the golden Rules which S. Augustine prescribes for a
Christian man's direction in the case of ceremonies. The first of these is that
rule which the Apologists have chosen to oppose against us; let us repeat

The argument which Archbishop Whitgist has used and urged, taken from S.
Augustines rule.
SECT. 3.
4 Out of the Apolog.
Forasmuch (says he) as the original and beginning of these names of
Metropolitan, Archbishop etc. such is their antiquity, cannot be found, so
far as I have read: it is to be supposed they have their original from the
Apostles themselves.

5 We shall not need to dispute with the Apologists of the truth of this
consequent, for they confess that it is learnedly and truly urged; yet would
it become them to know the measure thereof by a double dimension, breadth and
depth: the breadth reaches no further then unto matters of ceremonies, and
other customs of the Church. For as for doctrines of faith, (if they shall be
applied unto this rule,) these are the Churches conclusions, and are so far
to be believed as they depend upon their authentical premises, even the
sacred Scriptures; which we have proved from S. Augustine, and other Fathers to
be the perfect treasury of all fundamental principles of Faith.

6 Secondly, the depth of the same position, if it be rightly sounded, will be
found to be a truth of So B. Whitgift, with others.
strong probability only, and not of an absolute infallibility; as may seem
to be intimated both by the word [supposed,] which is used by our learned
Archbishop, and also by the confession of Jesuits, who grant, that the names of
Metropolitan and Archbishop are not Apostolical, but Apostolicae Traditiones
sunt Quadrag^simae ieiunium, etc. -- Ecclesiasticae Traditiones sunt mores and
consuetudines, quas obserua. Ecclesia, nimirum illa consecrat altaria, --
distinxit Episcopos, Archiepiscopos, Primates, Metropolitanos, Patriarchas;
Constitutiones sancit. Azorius Ies. Instit. Moral. part. 1. lib. 8. cap. 4.
Quod vero quaesitum est, cur non meminit Petrus Hierarchiae Ecclesiasticae,
quae tot habet gradus Episcoporum, Archiepiscoporum, Patriarcharum, etc. hoc
ideo factum est, quia institutione Ecclesiastica and Canonica constat, si autem
hic enumerarentur, possent hinc putari iuris diuini existere, quod falsum
esset: enamsi legimus apud Clementem in epistola ad Iacobum, aut apud Anacletum
in Epistola, Domini iussu and mandato gradus illosfuisse institutos: and illi
gradus enumerati nihil aliud sunt quam Episcopatus, qui maiorem aut minorem
habent iurisdictionem, non autem maiorem potestatem ordinis. Salmeron Ies. com.
in 1. Pet. 5. disp. 8.. Quod vero. Their Cardinal Cusanus does specify the
originals: Vbi erat Metropolis ciuitas, Metropolitani erant, qui de tribus aut

vnde isti aliquando Metropolitani, aliquando Archiepiscopi nomniantur: vbi
minores civitates habuerunt tantum flamines, vel comites Episcopi sunt
constituti, etc. Cusanus de Con^^d. Cathol. lib. 1. cap. 7.
Ecclesiastical Traditions. Howsoever, the collections will be found
altogether importable, which either our M. Cartwright, or their Apologists have
deduced from it. And first we manifest, that

The inference made by M. Cartwright upon the former argument, is infirm.
SECT. 4.
7 By this rule (says he) a window is opened to bring in all Popery: and for
the evidence of his inference, he aduentureth to appeal unto the judgment of
all men; but herein has he bewraied a double defect of judgment in himself.
For by that rule of S. Augustine (which implies only matters ceremonial and
Ecclesiastical Constitutions,) to enforce all Popery (which stands upon many
doctrinall points of faith,) is no less error in true scholership, then from
a particular proposition to infer an universal conclusion. * See hereafter
where the new Romish inventions are fully discovered.
Whereas, indeed contrariwise our grave and judicious Archbishop has well and
truly replied, that Archb. Whitgift in the place alleged by the Apolog.
this rule of S. Augustine is so far from authorizing Popery, that it rather
quite overthrows the same; for that by it is confuted the Supremacy of the
Pope over all other Churches, which has neither ben always, nor in all
places: as has been also proved, and See above, Cap. 18.
may be further confirmed, not only in matters of Ecclesiastical rites and
orders, but even in questions which concern the soul of Religion.

8 But he held it sufficient, in speaking of Popery, to strike only at the
head thereof, by instancing in the Primacie of the Pope: which is so true, that
S. Augustine himself, who is the author of that Rule, may be the iustifier of
his application. For in the case of Appiarius, a wicked Priest (who being
excommunicated by his own Bishops, sought to be restored by Pope Celestine)
Erat Conciliu^ Carthaginense, anno Dom. 419. in causa Appiarij Presbyteri.
Posseuinus Apparat. Sacr. Tit. Carthag. Huic Conc^lio Augustious interfuit.
Costerus Ies. Enchirid. De numero sacraru^ Script. This Counsel is objected
for denying Appeals unto Rome, and prefers the authority of a provincial
Council before the authority of the Bishop of Rome.
the Council of Carthage, consisting of Cranzius.
214. Bishops, among whom S. Augustine was one, did withstand the Appeals from
Afric unto the Sea of Rome, preferring the judgment of a provincial Synod
before the command or jurisdiction of the Pope. And could the Papal Primacy,
which is the head of Popery, receive a deeper wound then this was? whereof we
may judge better by the plaster which their Cardinal Bellarmine has prepared
in the way of answer and satisfaction. [Nisi forte (says the Council)
quisquam est qui credat vnicuilibet Deu^ posse examinis inspir are iustitiam,
and innumerabilibus congregatis in Concilium Sacerdotibus denegare.] Respondeo,
-- non necessario tenemur credere quidquid in ea epistola Episcopi illi dicant,
praesertim cum satis appareat, cos commotos sceleribus Appiarij, qui ad Romans
Pontificem confugerat, modum in verbis non nihil excessisse. Bellarm. lib. 4.
de Romans Pont. cap. 7.. Quarta ratio, etc.
I answer (says he) that we are not bound to beleene whatsoever the Bishops of
that Council writ in that Epistle, especially knowing that they were then much
moved with the mischiefs wrought by Appiarius, (who then fled unto the Bishop
of Rome,) and somewhat exceeded measure in their words.

9 But we stand not upon words, but examine their deeds, and hereuppon demand
which side may rather be thought to have exceeded measure? whether that
Council which excommunicated so notorious a man, or the Pope, who endeavored
to restore him? Then let us compare S. Augustines consent unto that Council,
with his now objected rule, and do they not both justify our Archbishops
Assertion in the confutation of the now usurped Papal supremacy? So now we
see that little window, which seemed to be open unto all Popery, to be closely
shut, and a great door opened for the maintenance of the liberty of other
provincial Councels in all their just oppositions against the Pope. It
remains we answer unto

The Apologists collection, which is taken from the former erroneous Inference:
proving it to be deceitful.
SECT. 5.
10 These Apologists working artificially upon the abouenamed misconstruction
of that rule of S. Augustine, make it one of their premises, whereby evidently
to confirm their foresaid religion: yet when we consulted with S. Augustine
concerning the ground of all doctrine, he told us that nothing is necessary,
which is not contained in Scripture: which overthrows the Romish religion in
their traditionall doctrines.

11 When we seek his judgment concerning rituall and ceremonial
Constitutions, he requires the use of that Leni nos iugo Christus subiecit,
and leui sarcinae. August. epist. 118.
lenis iugi, and leuis sarcinae, that is, the easiness of Christ's yoke, and
lightness of his burden: reaching us herein a sharp razor to cut away the
most of the Romish ceremonies, which See above lib. 1. cap. 3.
have been manifested to be for number more then Jewish, many for observation
superstitious, and some also in signification ridiculous.

12 Wherefore seeing the Apologists, when they could not be ignorant of M.
Cartwrights misapplication of that rule, or of our Archbishops learned reply,
yet durst adventure to lay the whole frame of all Romish religion upon this one
silly Assumptio^, taken but from one distressed Answerer, by misconstruction of
but one testimony of S. Augustine, which can but only probably prove their
intent; they stand herein thrice reproucable, and may worthily exemplify the
parable of our Savior in the Gospel, where the unwise man is said to build
his whole house upon the Matthew. 7. 26.
sands. Here end the Apologists objections, and our answers concerning the
judgment of ancient Fathers in many particulars. Only we hold it necessary
to add as a supplement the question following: and to show

CHAP. XXIX. A general Tract concerning the authorities of ancient Fathers:
showing the Romanists profession, yea and oath of consenting unto the Fathers
expositions; together with their neglect of due accordance.
SECT. 1.
THe Romanists are very large in their protestations in this behalf, saying:
Non sunt improbanda veterum Patru^ testimonia, quando omnes vel fere omnes in
vnam sententiam conueniunt, vel in vno aliquo Scripturae loco interpr^rando
concordant. Salmeron Iesuita comment. in 1. Ioh. 3. disp. 25.. Tertio.
When either all, or almost all ancient Fathers consent in one opinion, or else
in the interpretation of any one place of Scripture, they may not be impugned.
Or thus, Quod mayor pars Patrum senserint, id esse Catholicae veritatis
profitemur. Canus locis Theol. lib. 7. cap. 3. Ad Patrum suffragia (ringatur
inuidia licet) adhaerescemus. Campianus Ration.
When the greater part of Fathers do agree in one judgment, we profess this
to be a Catholic truth. And the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth, in the
confirmation of the Council of Trent, prescribes an oath unto all Bulla D. N
Pij 4. diuina prouidentia Papae, quarti, super forma iuramenti professionis

Bishops, Deanes, Canons, and all that have cure of souls, together with all
that enjoy any places in Monasteries, Conuents, or Houses, and to whatsoever
person regular, to swear, never to receive or use any interpretation of
Scripture, which is not according to the uniform consent of ancient Fathers.

2 Never did the ancient Jews more boast of their original and descent from
Father Abraham, then do the Romanists glory in their pretended consent of
ancient Fathers; yet as the ostentation of the former was condemned of Christ,
as carnal, so this latter may be justly condemned as sophistical.

3 For they affirm, that Augustinus and caeteri Patres in commentarijs
fungebantur officio Doctorum: at Conci^^a and Pontifices funguntur officio
ludicis a Deo tibi commisso. Paulo superius: Ad explanationem more Doctoris
^ruditio, ad modum indicis authoritas requiritur: Doctor proponit sententiam
suam -- sequendam solum quatenus ratio suadet, at Iudex vt necessario
sequendam. Bellarm. lib. 3. de verbo Dei, cap. vlt.. Aliter.
the Fathers are to be accounted as Doctors, not as Judges, not necessarily to
be obeyed, but to be followed so far as reason shall persuade. This might
seem reasonable, if they had not bound themselves by oath to follow their
uniform consent: for where there is a necessity of duty challenging the
assent, there is no place left for liberty of persuasion by reason. Yet would
we know how reasonable they will appear to be in their practice? In the
exposition of the last commandment, they yield unto us Non concupisces, etc.]

That does not seem unto me to be the true sense, which all Authors whom I can
remember (except Hilary) do use. Their Jesuit Tollet interpreting a verse of
the Psalm. 31. In camo and fraeno Psalm. 31.] in cuius explicatione nec Graeci
nec Latini, nec qui Hebraeos sequuntur mihi perfect loqui videntur. Tollet.

Neither the Greek, nor Latin Authors seem unto me (says he) to have
delivered the perfect meaning hereof. Their Jesuit Salmeron explaining a text
of S. Paul's Epistle, 1. Cor. 6. Peccat in corpus suum. 1. Cor. 6.] Id est,
obligauit corpus liberum, and obnoxium reddidit iuri and potestati meretricis.

disp. 9.. Dicendum ergo.
This is the meaning thereof, which I marvel (says he) other authors (he
excepteth none but himself) do not duly apprehend.

4 There is no man that is traveled in the writings of the Jesuits, but
knows that these three or four are but the examples of three times three
hundreds (which we speak not by excess) of the like kind of interpretations,
wherein they profess to Prophetae and lex vsque ad Iohannem. Matthew. 11. 13.]
Eas (interpretationes) recitabo, quas venerandos authors habere video, quibus
hoc debemus, vt little sententias aut sequamur, aut honorifice recitemus. --

fatis apta interpretatio. Maldon. Ies. com. in ^um locum.
cite the expositions of Fathers, although not to follow them, yea even then,
when they confess, almost all Fathers to consent.

5 If they shall say, that the tenor of their oath of expounding Scriptures
according to the uniform consent of Fathers, is to be understood only of
expositions concerning documents of faith, and necessary precepts of life; yet
can they not escape the guilt of transgression. For first, to know whether it
be generally inexpedient for men not to marry, does necessarily concern the
Church both to understand and teach: as when Christ's disciples objected saying,
Then it is not expedient for a man to marry; and our Master answered, [All men
receive not this saying,] it is confessed concerning the Fathers, that Non
omnes capiunt hoc verbum. Matthew. 19. 11.] Quod dicit [Non omnes capiunt hoc
verbum] ita fere omnes exponunt, tanquam si sensus esset, Non omnes quod
dicitis praestare possunt, id est, carere vxore, quia non omnes castitaeis
donum habent. -- Ita Orig^nes Tract. in Matthew. 7. Greg. Nazianzen. Orat. in
haec verba, Ambrosius in exhort. ad Virg. Quam interpretationem adduci no^
possum vt sequar, quia cum Christus versu seq. dicat, Qui potest, minime dubium
est quin capero dicat pro intelligere. Maldon. comm. in eum lo^^m. He opposes
only Epiphanius.
almost all of them expound this answer of Christ to signify that it is not in
all men's power to live unmarried, because of the want of the gift of continency:
implying (as we think) a necessity in some to marry: yet their Jesuit
(notwithstanding this large consent of almost all the Fathers) is bold under
the shadow of only one to oppose, saying: I cannot be brought to follow this
interpretation, but think rather that Christ by saying, [All men receive not
this saying] meant that all men did not understand it.

6 Secondly, our Adversaries make no doubt but that the true words of
consecration in the Eucharist are necessary for to work their imagined
Transubstantiation, without the which they account the Sacrament no better then
bare bread, and the true form of consecration (as their Trent Catechismus qui
ex Concilio Trident. Pij Quinti Pontificis maximi iussu, ad P^^ochos primum
editus. -- Forma conficiendae Eucharistiae, and consecrationis panis haec est;
[Hoc est corpus meum:] and [Hic est calix] etc. Apud Ederum in partitionibus
Catechis. Trident. Tab. 56.
Catechism teaches) does consist in these words, [hoc est corpus meum, this
is my body, etc.] which they hold, as Cardinal Haec est forma, omnium
consensu. Bellar. See above quaest. de Eucharist. number. 63.
Bellarmine pretends, with an universal consent: notwithstanding their
learned Archbishop in his Treatise, lately dedicated unto Pope Sixtus Quintus,
durst avouch that this doctrine is Totus in little raptus sum sententiam, qui
sola prolatione verborum q^^tuor sine precibus dictam consecrationem fieri
posse negant, -- sed per verba sacrae orationis. -- Hancque esse om^um
orthodoxorum, tum Graecorum tum Latinorum sententiam. Archiepiscopus Caesarien.
de necess. correct. Theol. Scholast. (...). 1. fol. 115.
contrary to the judgment of all orthodoxall Fathers, both Greek and Latin.

7 Infinite might we be in such like exemplifications; which by due examination
prove, that our Adversaries do not only not defend the most controuerted points
by either all, or half, and sometimes not by a many or yet few expositions of
Fathers; but also in some points do reject them all, as formerly their
Cardinal Caietane has done, who professed In initio siquidem commentariorum
in Genesin, si quando, inquit, (Caietanus) occurrerit nouus sens^^ textui
consonus, quamuis a torrente Doctorum sacrorum alienus, aequum se praebeat
Lector censorem. Et paulo post: Nallus, ait, detestetur nouum sacrae Scripturae
sensum, ex hoc quod dissonat a priscis Doctoribus: non enim alligauit Deu^
^^positionem Scripturarum sacrarum priscorum Doctorum sensibus, sed Scripturae
ipsi integrae sub Catholicae Ecclesiae cen^^a. Vt refert Canus locis Theol.
lib. 7. cap. 3. number. 10.
to follow that sense of exposition of Scripture, which appears to be most
consonant unto the context of Scripture, notwithstanding the stream and
torrent of ancient Expositors writing to the contrary. For better trial
hereof, we annexe

A second observation of the Romish practice in so rejecting the testimonies of
Fathers, as professedly to prefer the judgment of their younger Divines
before the confessed custom and doctrine of Antiquity.
SECT. 2.
8 If the Romanists professing to follow the consent of Fathers had only not
followed them, and not also professed not to follow them, their degeneration
from antiquity, and guilt of preuarication should have been ^he less: but
their Bishop Espencaeus waxes wroth with Protestants for dis^king the
circumgestation of the Eucharist in procession, as being contrary to the
practice of ancient Churches; and in the end answers, that Non obstat quod
circumgestatio Eucharistiae videtur res noua, quia valet ad deuotionem
excitandam: sed Christus, aiunt Aduersarij, in hoc Sacramento cibus est vt
sumatur, non vt osten tetur and circumferatur. Sed non sunt audiendi qui circa
Dei and Sacramentoru^ cultum omnia reduci volunt ad vetustu^ morem: ^o^ enim
semper ^elius quod antiquius. Claudius Espencaeus, l. 2. de adorat. ^uchar.
cap. 8. sub finem.
they are not to be heard speak, who concerning the worship of God and use of
the Sacraments, would have all things reduced unto their ancient course;
because (says he) that is not always best, which is the more ancient.

9 Secondly, in their last oath they are sworn to believe the Indulgentiarum
potestatem a Christo in Ecclesia relictam fuisse, ^llarumque vsum populo
Christiano maxim salutarem esse affirmo. --
power of Indulgences to be instituted by Christ; and as a doctrine profitable
for all Christians, they reckon it among the Articles of the Romish faith, Hane
veram and Catholicam fide^, extra quam nemo saluus esse possit, etc. Bulla Pii
4. post Conc. Trid.
without which (say they) there is no salvation: notwithstanding that this may
seem to have been of so late an invention, that their Bishop Multos fortasse
mouet, indulgentij^ istis non vsque adeo fide^^, quod earu^ vsus in ^cclesia
videatur fuisse recentior and ad^odum tero repertus apud Christianos. Quibus
ego respondeo, no^ certo constare a quo primu^ tradi coeperunt. fuit tamen
nonnullus earu^ vsus vt aiunt (speaking of his own Romanists) apud Romanos
vetustissimos, quod vel ex stationibus in vrbe freque^tissinus intelligi datur
(which are no better evidences for indulge^^^ then posts in the field ar to
prove a race) sed and Gregor. 1 aiunt, aliquas ^uo tempore concessisse: neque
cuiquam obscurum est quin posterioribus ingenijs multa sint tam ex Euangelijs
quam ex Scripturis caeteris nunc excussa luculentius, and intellects
perspicacius, quam fuerant olim; nimirum, aut quia veteribus adhuc non erat
perfracta glacies, neque sufficiebat illorumaetas totum illud Script^ra^um
Pelagus ad aniussim expendere, aut etc. R^ffensis Episcopus assert. Lutheran.
consut. art. 18 initi^*
Roffensis finding no sufficient evidence in ancient records, is constrained in
the end to answer thus: There is no man (says he) but may perceive, that there
are now many things understood in Scriptures more plainly, and more clearly
discussed, then they were in ancient times.

10 Thirdly, we read Romans 5. that Christ is acknowledged to be the only just
one, and that except him In quo omnes peccauerunt. Romans 5.
all men sinned in one man Adam, from whom all others are descended by natural
and carnal procreation. We believe and teach, that where all is so precisely
mentioned, no one that is naturally descended from mankind, no not the blessed
Virgin can plead exemption: and herein (by the confession of Erasmus) we have
the consent of all those holy Fathers, who ever fell into the mention hereof.
But the Romanists hold the contray, Add, quod etsi eius contradictoria
propositio non sit, vt haeretica, damnata, non nihil ^ame^ ad fidem spectat, eo
quod in Ecclesia pie receptus est cultus huius sententiae, and authoritate
Pontificis cum fauore indulgentiarum celebrari mandatus: nonnullis quoque
miraculis and reuelationibus ad seruos and ancillas Dei factis, comprobatus
creditur. -- Hoc priuilegium Thomas, quasi nimis excelsum, Virgini denegauit,
putans per illud adaequari beatam Virgine^ Jesus Christo. Salmeron Ies. commen.
in Romans 5. disp. 49.. Et primum. and. Nec potest. In celeberrima Parisiorum
Acaden^^ nullus magistri in Theologia titulo dignus habetur, qui prius
iurisiurandi religione non se adstrinxe^it ad hoc Virginis priu^iegium tuendum
and propugnandum. Ibid. disp. 51.. Deinde illis.
Which (say they) does somewhat concern faith, being received in our Church,
approved by the Pope with the grace of Indulgences unto them that embraced it,
and confirmed by revelations and miracles: which privilege of the Virgin,
although S. Thomas Aquinas denied, as derogatory from the dignity of Christ,
because hereby she is equalled with him: yet do all that take any degree in the
profession of Divinity in the University of Paris, first swear, that they
will defend this prerogative of the blessed Virgin. Here is a strong and
strange antipathie.

11 Again their Jesuit Salmeron does answer, saying, Argumenta petunt ex eo,
quod non sit verisim^^ vt sui deuoti amici, and familiari religione Diuam
Virginem complectentes, vt Bernardus, Bonauentura, Thomas, and alij, h^^^ cius
piaerogatiuam ignorauerint. -- Respondemus imprimis, totam deuotionem ^rga Dei
genitricem non consistere (...) Bernardo, Bonauentura, and alijs Patribus:
multos habuit illa, and adhuc habet sibi magis quam mundo notos, quibus haec
nostra sententia magis placet quam contraria. Salmeron. ibid.. Secundo.
All devotion e Sancti namque omnes qui in eius rer mentionem incidere, vno ore
asse^erarunt beatam Virginem in peccato mortali conceptam fuisse: -- infirmum
tamen ex omnium authoritate argume^tumd* citur. -- En argumentum Achillicum,
quo Erasmus omnium Patrum testimonio non le existimat obruendum. Canu^l^^
Theol. lib. 7. cap. 1. after answers cap. 3. Hanc quaestionem minime ad sidem
pertinere. -- Non mihi, fateor ingenue, (...) via patu^t ad Erasmi argumentum
eludendum: yet in the next words contradicting himself, would make the Fathers
not to (...) held that opinion; notwithstanding the Jesuit Salme ron reporting
the judgment of some Romanists, says, that, Quidam illore^ computant ducentos
Patres, alij, vt Bandellus, 300. Caietanus quindecim, and illos quidem, vt ait
irrefragabiles, Salmeron Ies a Romans 5. disp. 51. princip.
belonging unto the honor of the Virgin and Mother of our Lord, does not
consist in S. Bernard, or Bonauenture, or Thomas, or other Fathers: and in the
end concludes, Tertio, argumenta petunt a Doctorum antiquitate, cui semper
mayor honor est habitus, quam nouitatibus. Re^pondet^r, quamlibet aetate^
antiquitati semper multu^ detulisse, and quilibet sen^x, vt quidam Poeta dixit,
Laudator tempori^ acti. Sed illud asserimus, quo iuniores, eo perspicaciores
esse Doctores. Salmeron ibidem.. Tertio.
Younger Divines are more apprehensiue of truths, then were the more ancient
Doctors. Which censure, we think, could not pass from them (especially in a
matter now generally professed of their Church, as worthy, in their opinion,
the approbation of the Pope, and confirmation by Revelations and Miracles, and
ratification by an oath) without a kind of check and scorn of reverend
antiquity.

12 Fourthly, in another question of necessary moment, Conuenit internos and
Aduersarios, praecepta Leuitica non obligare Christianos, quatenus sunt proprie
Leuitica, -- sed quatenus naturalia. Sed tota controuersia est, an omnia illa
praecepta quae habentur in Leuitico de gradibus cognationis sint naturalia, an
vero aliqua, vel omnia iudicialia? Aduersarij omnia naturalia esse volunt, and
propterei indispensabilia, nos contra. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Matrimon. cap. 27.
initio cap.
whether the Leuiticall Law, concerning the degrees forbidden in marriage,
belong unto Christians (whereby Protestants from the authority of ancient
Fathers, prove the Church of Rome to be a patroness of Incest, by dispensing
with marriages prohibited by God) another Adversary was licenced to answer
thus: Maneat sane Patribus suus honos, sua ma^estas, sint, vt merentur, in
summa veneratione ac pretio: -- insuper audeo dicere, recentiores multis in
locis Patribus pressiores, excussiores, diligentiores, vigilantiores esse.
Apologia Tumultuaria pro dispe^satione matrimonij Regis Henr. 8. cum vxore
fratris sui defuncti.. Postre^o illud.
With reservation (says he) of due honor unto the Ancient Fathers, the younger
Divines are in many places more vigilant and judicious, (meaning in disce^ning
the sense of Scriptures) then were those ancients. These kind of answers
bewray our Adversaries dispositions: which we further manifest by

A third observation, that the Romanists do sometime contradict the
interpretations of Fathers, not so much by the direction of reason, as by the
distraction of affection.
SECT. 3.
13 Affection is distorted, whenever it is partially transported, whether it
be upon a good, or a sinister intent; in both which kinds our adversaries do
discover themselves: one professing that it is no fault to interpret Scripture
beyond their meaning, Bernardum putant aliqui sacras Scripturas prompte magis
atque inexpedito saepenumero, quam apposite citare, nulla quidem impietate aut.
Scripturarum iniuria: non enim potest honesta ad pietatem docendi aliqua esse
inhonesta ratio. Tumult Apologia, fol. 34.. Primum igitur. He bewraieth his
own intent, and in the case in question wrongeth S. Bernard and others.
so long as it be done to confirm godliness: which we judge to be a profane
and licentious doctrine, because it is impossible that Scripture, which is Gods
truth, should allow alying Gloss. As for example where their Siculus Andrae
as, cognom^nto Ba^batius, -- vt i Bessarione Antistite, and -- Cardinale
gratiam iniret, de ear Commentariolum prius edidit. -- Occurrit, inquit in 1
Reg cap 2. [Domini enim sunt cardines terrae, and posuit super eos orbem] quam
authoritatem Hostiensis Doctor excelsus figurauit ad Cardinales: sicut enim
ostium regitur cardine, ita and Ecclesia Romana regitur consilio Cardinalium
Haec ille --
Lawyers, to win favor of the order of Cardinals, alleged that Scripture, 1.
Sam. 2. 8. where the godly woman in praying unto God, said [the pillars (in
Latin Cardines) of the earth are the Lords, and he has set the world upon
them,] and glozingly writ, that by this was figured the Cardinals, because as a
door by a hinge (or Cardine) so is the Roman Church ruled by Cardinals. Which
kind of Expositors are not unfitly compared by their Vide, non secus isti
iuri^consulti aliquoties detorquent sacras literas quo volunt, vt sutores
sordidis solent dentibus extendere pelles. Polydor Virgil. lib. 4. cap. 9.
Invent. rerum. Lugduni 1558. Whose last sentence is commanded by their Index
Expurg. Belg. to be purged out.
Polydore so to wrest the Scriptures, even as Shoomakers use to streth their
leather with their sordid teeth. And can they show one Father, who thus dreamed
of their Cardinals?

14 Their sinister affection lies open unto the Reader, where they profess
not to consent unto the Fathers, to the intent that they may manifest their
greater dissent from the doctrine of Protestants: for thus does their Jesuit
Maldonate demean himself for propounding an interpretation of Scripture,
whereof he says he had no Author, No^ nego me huius interpretationis Authorem
neminem habere, sed hanc eo magis probo quam illam alteram Augustini,
caeterarumque alioqui probabilissima^: quod haec cum Caluinistarum sensu magis
pugnet: quod mihi mag number est probabilitati^ argumentum. Maldonat. Ies. comm.
in Ioh 6. 62.
Yet notwithstanding (says he) I do approve this exposition, rather then that
of S. Augustines, or else any others; although most probable, because it does
most dissent from the interpretation of the Caluinists. So likewise their
Cardinal Bellarmine examining whether the Duae scripturae proferuntur, vna ex
cap. 6. Marci, altera Iac. 5. de priore non omnes conueniunt, an, cum Apostoli
vngebant olco infirmos, and curabant, illa fuerit vnctio Sacramentalis, -- an
solum adumbratio eius Qui tuentur priorem sent^ntiam, vt Tho. Waldensis and
Alphonsus a Castro, ^a ratione ducuntur, quod Beda, Theoph Oecumen. in
co^mentarijs Marci and Iacobi videantur dicere, esse eandem vnctionem cuius fit
mentio in vtro que loco. Sed probabilior est sententia Ruardi, ^ansenij, and
Dominici a Soto: mibi etiam eo certe nomine gratior, quod video Lutherum,
Caluinum, and Kemnitium in priore opinione; existimant enim illi eandem
vnctionem esse in Mare. 6. and Iao. 5. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Extrem. vnct. cap.
2. initis.
same kind of unction be signified Mark. 6. and Iac. 5. (a point of some
special consequent) refuses the judgment of Beda, Theophylact, and
Oecumenius, and prefers the opinion of no Fathers, but even of three Doctors
of his own profession; which (says he) is the better welcome, because I find
Luther and Calvin to embrace the other opinion, namely, of Beda, Theophylact,
and Oecumenius; unto whom we may add for us the judgment of See above.
Cardinal Caietane.

15 Besides all which, a late Romanist does boast himself to be another
Columbus, that as he discovered new countries, so does this man glory in
finding out new constructions, and manner of Quemadmodum Christophorus Columbus
-- cum praeter omnem expectationem in vasto illo oceano nouum orbem aperuisset,

interpretation of Scriptures. And if we ask him how he could find out that,
which has lien hid so many ages? he is licensed to answer, that if God to show
his power in his Catholic Church, shall make the barren womb os Sara
fruitful in her old age, then may the Church say with Sara, God has caused me
to laugh. Laugh? but true Catholics will rather grieve to perceive any man's
wit so seriously idle, as to endeavor to unclasp the whole book of Revelation
by an analyticall, and indeed cabalisticall manner of exposition, which he has
set abroach: whereof we may give our Reader a taste in Hebrew, Greek, Latin,
and English.

16 The Hebrew word Ibid. page 102.
Gomalim, signifying Cammels, from the roots thereof Gam-malim, he will needs
have to be signified Protestants: and the Greek word Page 294.
(...), Revel. 9. 11. must morethen intimate Luther. The Latin Bonum, he

[Bo] which is (says he) an intentive particle, and of [num] coming of nuo:
and the English word God, of an intensiue particle [Go] and the syllable [od,]
which is of it self. And by this art he intends shortly to avouch the truth
of the Romish Church, and prove the Protestants doctrine to be Antichristian.

17 But hereby he has moved pity even in his Adversaries, who know that the
affectation of such an interpretation must redound unto the Sacra vetustatis
authoritate profanae nouitatis cense remus. audaciam. Vinc. Lyrinensis.
profanation of the sacred word of God, which was abused by old heretics
called Gnostics, and Valentinians, even through the like kind of speculations,
as Epiphan. lib. 1. aduersus haeres.
Epiphanius observes: and therefore may be an argument unto their Reader of a
man suddenly gone out of the sunshine into a dark house, who the more
clearly he saw before, the less now he can see. There follows

A fourth observation of a cunning practiced by our Adversaries, in wronging
the testimonies of antiquity.
SECT. 4.
18 When the Fathers make clearly against them, some possibly will follow the
examples of D. Allen and D. Sanders, Difficultate oppressus Alanus Copus, and
Sanderus, respo^dent, verba illa non esse Epiphanij, sed supposititia: -- id
quod common and frequens effugium esse solet ijs, qui testimonijs Conciliorum
aut Patrum in aliqua controuersia nimis premuntur. -- Mihi vero haec responsio
non placet. -- Porro verba illa recitata esse ipsius Epiphanij, nec
supposititia inde constabit, etc -- Vasquez Ies. lib. 2 de Adorat. disp. 5.
cap. 3. number. 140. 141.
who (as their own Jesuit Vasquez witnesses,) being oppressed with
difficulty of answering, said, that the words alleged out of the Father
Epiphanius are counterfeit: although indeed (says the same Jesuit,) it may
appear, that they are (which he proves by good demonstration,) certainly the
proper words of the Father.

19 But what if this escape be prevented by public registers, such as be the
books of the Council? Their Jesuit Vasquez has given example of Recentiores
aliqui pondere h^^^s (Concilij Elibertini) quasi oppressi, tanqua^ optimum
effugium elegeru^t, authoritatem Concilij negate, quod Prouinciale fuerit, --
nec a Pontifice confirmatum: -- Et sane, si alia via Concilio satisfieri non
possit, hoc nobis effugium sufficiat. Vasquez Ies. lib. 2. de Adorat. disp. 5.
cap. 2. initio cap. Baronius tom. 2. anno 305. -- existimat hanc Synodum
legitimam fuisse. Binius de Conc. com. in Can. 36. Concilij Elibert.
some, who of late (says he) being as it were oppressed with the authority of
the provincial Council of Eliberis (which condemned the worship of Images)
held it their best refuge to deny the authority of that Council, as being
but only provincial, and not confirmed by the Pope; and doubtless (says he)
this evasion may serve the turn, if a better answer cannot be found. This
Council is ancient, even 1300 years ago (according unto Binius,) wherein
there was a consent of Fathers in a definitive sentence, no Father of that age,
or of many ages after contradicting their determination.

20 If this answer fail, and that the Fathers testimonies be proved entire,
then (not to call in question their art of corrupting the Fathers, which their
In hoc capite non du bium quin multa sint addita, veluti declarandi gratia, ab
ijs, qui omnia magnorum authorum scripta spurcis suis manibus contaminabant.
Lodouicus Viues in lib. 22. de Ciuitate Dei, cap. 8. page 693. Lugduni 1560.
Viues may seem to note in their own men) they do betake themselves unto two
other shifts: for first they instruct their Divines, that whenever they shall
be pressed with the authorities of ancient Fathers, In Catholicis veteribus
plurimos feramus authors, and extenuemus, excusemus, excogitato commento,
persaepe negemus, and commodum eis sensum affingamus, dum opponuntur in
disputationibus. Index Expurg. Belg. And that by [veteres] is meant the
Fathers, it appears by Gretzer: Quid piaculi fecit Index, cum -- pro Bertramo
agens, came illi gratiam fieri cupit, quae sit alijs nonnullis ex antiquorum
numero, vt Tertulliano and Origeni? Gretzer Iesuita de iure prohib. libros.
lib. 2. cap. 10. Obijcit Iunius.
by some devised and colorable Comment to excuse their speeches, or to deny
that they meant so, or else to apply unto them some favorable exposition. This
first is gentle physic, which if it do not work, then (this is their last
refuge,) they apply a stronger purge: for as they have Index Expurg. editus
Parisus, anno Domini 1557. And see this confessed before, Chap. 25. Sect. 3.
number. 6.
razed a sentence, which aduanceth the sufficiency of the sacred Scriptures,
out of that imperfect work which has long passed under the name of S.
Chrysostom; so they either do, or may hereafter practice the like tyranny
against the writings of other Fathers, especially seeing they challenge this
authority herein, upon a pretense that Secundo dum prohibetur Bertramus, nego
prohiberi Patrem; nam Ecclesiae Pater ille est, qui salutari doctrina Ecclesiam
alit and pascit: -- si pro tritico lolium admiscuerit, eatenus non pater est,
sed vitricus, non Doctor, sed seductor. -- Quarto insuetum non est, vt veteres
damnentur errores, si nocendo fiant noui. -- exemplum habemu^ in Gelasio
Pontifice, qui Tertullianum and Origenem, and alios, etsi valde antiquos, lege
lata ex orthodoxorum manibus and vsu excuss^t, ius hoc semper fuit penes
Ecclesiam. -- Etsi integrum librum proscribere fas est, fas etiam erit
proscribere partem; seu paruam, seu magnam; eum exscindendo, delendo,
obliterando, vel simpliciter omittendo, idque ob Lectoris vtilitatem. Gretzerus
Ies. de iure prohib. libros, lib. 2. cap. 10. page 328. and 329.
the father is no natural father, but a step-father, who nourishes not the
Church with wholesome food, but mixeth darnell and pernicious grain with the
wheat: therefore as the Popes (say they) have dealt with some writings of
Origin and Tertullian, by the same right may they now (according to their
wisdom,) abolish any writings of others, either in whole or in part, by
cutting or blotting them out. And so it may come to pass, that the Fathers
shall not only be no Judges, but even no Doctors of the Church; for they may
be silenced by their Popes, who are in our Adversaries doctrine the Fathers of
Fathers: and this must be the end of their disputes, not by persuading, but by
commanding a consent. We now come unto

The necessary cautions, which are to be used in the allegations of books of
antiquity.
The first is, that undoubted Authors be alleged, and not counterfeit.
SECT. 5.
21 It has been the common and constant profession of all Protestants to stand
unto the judgment of antiquity, for the continuance of the first four
hundred years, and more, in all things: which appears by their undoubted
books and testimonies, clearly and universally held in those purest times for
necessary doctrines of faith. The first caution is, that they bring us the
testimonies of true Fathers; otherwise the subornation of counterfeit
witnesses, must argue the weakness of the cause.

22 Their own Senens. Biblio. lib. 4. per totum.
Senensis and Posseuin. Apparat. per totum.
Posseuine have discovered, for their part, such a number of this illegitimate
seed, as does amount to many hundreds: by the error whereof, our Adversaries
usually delude their Reader, suggesting unto his weak sight erroneous Authors
under the names of orthodoxall Fathers; obiecting, for the defense of Romish
positions, testimonies in the Ambros. objected by the Rhemists, annot. in 1.
Timoth. 3. 15. although Salmeron reject all his commentaries upon S. Paul's
epistles: Salmer. Ies. in ep. Pauli, disp. 19. page 61. Tom. 13. So likewise

name of Ambrose, Clemens Romans Athanasius, Eusebius Emissenus, Dionysius
Areopagita, Cyprian, and multitudes of others, which by our Adversaries
themselves are rejected, as being works of a suborned and bastardly offspring.

23 And indeed these are no more fit truly to confirm any Romish doctrine,
then the Epistles of Clemens and Anacletus Bishops of Rome, can be thought
sufficient to countenance the Papal authority; which their learned Cardinal
Cusanus suspecteth to be Sunt meo iudicio illa scripta de Constantini donatione
Apocrypha: sicut fortasse longa scripta (speaking of their epistles in Gratian)
sanctis Clementi and Anacleto attributa, in quibus volentes exaltare Romanam
sedem, omni laud dignam, plus quam Ecclesiae expedit, se penitus quasi
fundant. Cardin. Cusanus lib. 3. Concord. Cathol. cap. 2. fol. 782.
Apocrypha: whereunto notwithstanding (says he) they do give credit, who do
too much defend the authority of the Sea of Rome. And if it be true which their
own Antonius Contius, Professor Regius in Academia Brugensi, Impres. Antuerp.
anno 1570. did. 16. Cap. Septuaginta, shows by many arguments. Omnium
Pontificum, qui Syluestrum praecesserunt, epistolas Decretales falsas esse.
Contius, one who was the public professor at Bruges, does by many reasons
contend to prove, viz. that the Decretall epistles of all the Popes (that is,
for almost the space of three hundred years,) before Pope Syluester, are
false: then why do they not adjure those many spirits to depart, which are of
this sort, and are yet held with them for Oracles, possessing the bodies of
their See Surius Tom. 1. and Binius Tom. 1. Conc.
Councels?

24 Again, their books which have been corrupted by heretics (which also are
confessed to have been many) are to be esteemed as none of the Fathers, being
by the The Pelagians corrupted the Commentaries attributed unto Ambrose:
witnessing Salmeron in epist. Pauli, disp. 19. page 61. and the annotations
upon S. Paul's epistles ascribed unto S. Hierome. Senens. Bibl. lib. 4. tit.

art of Arrians, Pelagians, Eunomians, Nouatians, Nicolaitans, and other
heretics, infected with deadly corruptions: so that the inexpert scholar is no
otherwise occupied in turning over the Fathers, then an ignorant man who is
conversant in an Apothecaries shop, where without wary circumspection he may
suck his bane out of boxes, which carry the title of an Antidote.

The second and third cautions, that the Testimonies be clear in their sense,
and general in consent.
SECT. 6.
25 Our Adversaries themselves know right well that the Fathers writings are
full of obscurities, which they note especially in S. Mos est Hieronymi

doctrines; wherein (as has been from their own confessions proved) they have
given us only shells in stead of kernels, and the words of Fathers against their
meanings. For else our Adversaries are not ignorant, that some Fathers
sometimes have had their bypath; in which regard the Romanists themselves do
admonish their Readers to Oportet matura consideratione expendere occasiones
non paucas, ob quas prisci illi Ecclesiarum Magistri interdum a veritatis scopo
aberrarunt; primum quia absque praeuio ductore intentatum ante a iter aggressi

oportunitate dixerunt, -- in multiloquio non deest peccatum. -- Praetere a dum
ardebant veteres illi tanto sincerae pietatis -- ardore, vt dum vnum errorem

weigh four occasions, whereby those ancient masters were made sometime to
miss their aim, and to err from the truth: adding, that in those very books
of theirs, which the Church does read for authentical, there are some things
found, which are indeed false and erroneous: and Etsi sacri Patres multa
praeclara and omni fide dignissima scripserint, quae merito tribuenda sunt
Spiritui sancto, qui illa eis suggessit; sunt tamen interdum nonnulla minus
certae and constantis veritatis, quaedam vero probabilia, and interdum
grauiores lapsus de rebus, quae in Ecclesia suo tempore definitae non erant,
and ideo ad authoritatis pondus and fastigium, quale obtinent Scripturae, non
pertingunt: ita vt Biblia sacra sola digna sint vt absolute dicantur
Scripturae. Salmeron Ies. comment. in 2. Tim 3. disp. 4.. Et addit.
although those holy Fathers did teach many things worthy of all credit, by the
direction of the holy Ghost; yet sometime they delivered some things
doubtfully, and in some things they did greatly err.

26 Which errors the Protestants have likewise noted, not as the children of
Cham, pointing at deformities to laugh and scorn, but as careful and
faithful Pilots, discovering shelues and sands, for the directing of others
in the safest course: which notwithstanding the Romanists do usually object for
the proof of Prayer for the dead, from such testimonies of some Fathers which
defended loca resrigerij: an error condemned by the Romanists. See above, lib.
1. cap. 2. Sect. 15.
Prayer for the dead, for Purgatory, from such authorities of some Fathers as
held that all the Saints, even the blessed Virgin also must be tried by fire
in the day of doom: and is rejected by the Romanists as erroneous. See ibid.
lit b. in the margent.
Purgatory torments, for Mixture of water with wine in the Eucharist, from such
sentences of a few Fathers, who taught that this mixture was in it self not
only a figure, but even an essential part of this Sacrament: confuted by
themselves. See above, lib. 2. cap. 4.
Mixture of water with wine in the Eucharist, for Necessity of Baptism of
Infants, from such clauses of some Fathers, who taught that otherwise they
should suffer eternal torments of hell: which our Adversaries do now utterly
dislike, as derogating from the mercy of God. See above, lib. 2. cap. 13.. 3.
Absolute necessity of baptism of all Infants, for That Antichrist must be a
Jew, from such comments of Fathers as rely upon a false interpretation of
Jacobs prophecy: which exposition our Adversaries confess to be violent and
untrue. See above lib. 2. cap. 5.. 2.
Antichrist to issue from some Jewish tribe, for Free will, from such opinions
of some Fathers as are confessed by themselves to have therein too much
inclined unto Pel^gianisme. See above lib. 2. cap. 10.. 1.
Man's free will unto good of himself: when as, notwithstanding these
testimonies and opinions of some particular Fathers, the Romanists themselves
have condemned such sentences, as being both false and pe^nicious: besides
their doctrine of See above lib. 1. cap. 2.. 19. 20. and seq.
Indulgence, which is confessed to have been scarce conceited on by either
Latin or Greek Fathers.

The last caution is, that the Fathers deliver their judgment in the nature of
necessary doctrine in Christianity.

Add but now in further demonstration hereof, that concerning such Articles of

Testament, whenever upon any occasion, direct mention is made of any of them,
either by those that were before Christ's time, or by the Jewish Rabbines since,
it is still with us, and against our Adversaries.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By an Introduction into the matter.
SECT. 1.
THE Apologists, after a long and oblique pilgrimage unto Lib. 1. cap. 1.

wended into Europe, Asia, and Afric, and all in visitation (if they might
have been found) of the old Monuments and Records of the now controuerted
Articles of faith; do now at length set foot within the coasts of Iudaea,
searching if there they may find some Relics of the Roman professi^n out of
the faith of ancient Jews: and by their first words [adde but now] put us in
good hope to make their full period here. But restless and vndeterminable are
the bypath of error, for now are we brought to follow them through a
wilderness of opinions, called the Jewish See hereafter cap. 3.. 1.
Talmud, and herein to seek the doctrines (as they pretend) of ancient Jewish
Rabbis: which is all one labor as to follow a swallow in her flight.
Nevertheless they call this observation a demonstration of their Romish faith:
which is prosecuted more fully by their Iodocus Coccius in his late huge
volumes entitled the Thesaurus Catholic^s, in quo controuersiae fidei. --
Catholic treasure of the controversies of faith: a work commended unto the
world, as Opus -- omnibus verae fidei, pietatis, and Christianae antiquitatis
amantibus sum necessarium. --

and authorized by the Cum priuilegio Caesareae Maiestatis. Coloniae 1599.
privilege of Caesar.

2 Which argument from the Jewish faith, albeit it seem unto the ignorant to
be (as they call it) a demonstration of their faith, yet will it prove unto the
judicious, a demonstration rather of folly, arising from the principles of
delusion: as may be euinced by the examination of their particulars, whereunto
we orderly proceed.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
So in the example of prayer for the dead, admitting the book of Macchabees
but for a true history.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Concerning the Canonical Scriptures of the old
Testament: herein conuincing these Apologists of rashness, and their Church of
obstinacy in erring, even by the universal judgment of the ancient Jews;
from the confessions of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
3 We may remember their challenge to be entitled A Catholic Apology; and
their first allegation for this last point to be taken out of the book of
Macchabees, admitting (as they say) the book but for a true history: implying
that it is not only true, as other humane histories, but that it is (as are
divine Scriptures) authentically and infallibly true: like as in producing the
book of Ecclesiasticus they said, See hereafter initio cap. 4. out of the
Apolog.
Though we should for a time suppose it not to be Canonical Scripture;
intimating that it is most certainly Canonical, as has been decreed by their
Council of Trent of Si quis librum Hester, Danielis, Baruch, Ecclesiastici,
Sapientiae, Judith, Tobiae, duorum Machabaeorum, Danielis libros integros cum
omnibus suis partibus, prout in veteri vulgata Latina editione habentur, pro
sacris and Canonicis non susceperit, -- Anathema sit. Conc. Trid. Sess. 4.
the books of Macchabees, Ecclesiasticus, Tobie, Judith, Baruch, Wisdom, and
some Apocryphal parts of Hester, and Daniel, by an imposition of their curse
of Anathema upon every one that shall not confess all these to be Canonical
Scriptures; as do the Protestants, whom our Adversaries do therefore condemn
as sacrilegiously Protestants illud ipsum verbum, quod solum restiterat,
exsectis e toto corpore tam multis partibus, delumbarunt. Campianus Ies. Rat.
1. Posseuin. Ies. in not is diuini verbi. page 26. Bellarm. lib. 1 de verbo
Dei, cap. 7. and seqq.
mayming and rending asunder the word of God.

4 This is a principal controversy, which concerns the integrity of holy
Scriptures, the principles of faith, wherein we appeal unto the judgment of
ancient Hebrews, Ij libri veteris Testamenti -- in Canone Hebraeorum non
habentur. Costerus Ies. Enchirid. cap. 1. de sacra Scriptura.. De numero
librorum. in sol. Ob. 1 and 2. Hij (sex) libri simul omnes reijciuntur ab
Hebraeis, vt B. Hieron. testatur in Prologo Galeato. De^nde Haebraeorum
sententiam sequuntur Haeretici (Protestants) huius temporis fere omnes.
Bellarm. lib. 1. de verbo Dei, cap. 10. initio.
who (as our Adversaries themselves confess) did reject all those six books
as not Canonical, which are excluded by Protestants. Yet this was the
prerogative of the Jews mentioned by the Apostle, to Romans 3. 2.
have the Oracles of God committed unto them; that is, (as says their
Cardinal Id est, Oracula diuina, in sacris Scripturis contenta, commissa and
concredita esse Iudaeis; apud eos enim in quadam custodia and deposito eloquia
Dei manserunt, factique sunt depositarij, and custodes eloquiorum Dei. Tolet.
Ies. ^om. in Romans 3. 2.
Tolet) The divine Scriptures, as Gods pledges were preserved by them.

5 But some peradventure will suspect that the Jews did violate and frustrate
this so sacred a depositum and repose, by rejecting some Scriptures which were
of divine authority. O no: for S. Hierome and Origin (whose sentence Cardinal
See hereafter cap. 16. Sect. 3.
Bellarmine does both allege and allow) did thus reason concerning the truth
of the Hebrew Testament; that if the books thereof had been corrupted, then
Christ or the Apostles would surely have reproved so notable a crime,
especially seeing they reprehended in them less faults. If this Argument may
pass for current for the justifying of the Jews, to free them from the
suspicion of a wilful deprauing of any sentence of Canonical Scriptures, shall
it not be of more weight to absolve them from dismembring whole books of holy
writ? Yes verily: for it will be confessed by their Cardinal Bellarmine, that
the Jews were always so religious, that they would See hereafter cap. 16.. 3.
choose rather to die an hundred deaths, then to suffer any corruption of the
holy Scriptures.

6 Again, we cannot, but acknowledge the observation of their Cardinal
Caietan to be very sound and judicious: Duas maximas vtilitates ex Iudaeorum
obstinatione percipimus, altera est fides librorum sacrorum. Si enim omnes
Iudaei conuersi essent ad Christum, putaret iam mundus Iudaeorum adinuentionem
fuisse -- quod fuerit promissus Messiah. Sed vbi inimici Christi Iudaei
perseuerant, and testantur nullos alios apud Patres fuisse libros Canonice
sacros, nisi istos. etc. Caiet. Card. com. in Romans ^ap. 11. page 76.
All Christians (says he) receive a double benefit by the apostacy and
obstinacy of the ^ewes; one is to know which are the true books of the old
Testament: for if all the Jews had been converted unto the faith of Christ,
then would the world have suspected that the Jews had invented those promises
which are of Christ the Messiah: but now inasmuch as the Jews are enemies unto
Christ, they bear witness unto us, that there are no other books Canonical
(meaning, of the old Testament) then those which the Jews themselves have
acknowledged. So that we may well think that that Church is less Christian,
which is not more Jewish in this Article concerning the Canon of holy
Scriptures, especially seeing (as will be confessed) the ancient Fathers did
embrace the judgment of the Jews in this point.

7 Let now any sensible brain of any Christian man, understand that the
Romanists (who stand convicted in this first and highest point of all
controversies, eue^ the discerning of the true Oracles of God) pretend a
demonstration of their faith out of the doctrine of ancient Jews: and he may
consequently judge what is the vanity of their challenge, wherein they have
adventured to profess, and that in print, See the Apology in the beginning of
this third book.
concerning such articles of faith now in question, that whenever upon any
occasion direct mention is made of any of them, either of those that were
before Christ, or by the Jewish Rabbis since, it is still with us (say they)
against our Adversaries. This their darkness in this one point is afterward
more fully discovered by examples of all the Churches of the world in the
primitive age after Christ, and by the confessions of many Roman Adversaries
witnessing the same truth of our profession concerning the Canon of Scriptures
of the old Testament. Now we come to the first question.

CHAP. II. Of Prayer for the dead; out of the book of Macchabees.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
It may not be denied but that long before Christ's time, Judas Macchabeus (the
undoubted servant of God) 2. Macchab. 2. 43.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
NO Bellarm. lib. 1. de Purg. cap. 3. Coccius ^n Thesauro Cathol. Greg. Valent.

Romanist almost falls into this argument of Prayer for the dead, but he
presently points at this place with an (...), as though this were in it self
sufficient to confound any Protestant: but we answer by examination 1. of the
Translator, 2. the Relator, 3. the Actor, and 4. the authority of this story,
now mentioned.

2 The translation is according to the vulgar Latin, which D. Lib 1. de
Idolat. cap. 5. Sect. 8 and 9.
Reynolds has proved from all the Greek Originals, and many Latin copies to
be corrupted, which has it thus; Et facta collatione etc. that is, And having
made a gathering, he sent twelve thousand drachmes of silver to Jerusalem, to
be offered for a sacrifice for the sins of the dead. The word [mortuorum,] of
the dead, is added, even as is the naming of twelve thousand drachmes in stead
of two thousand: as though they meant hereby to enlarge their royal exchange
of Indulgences.

3 Secondly, the Relator Jason Cyrenaeus, who calls himself the 2. Machab.
2. 24.
abridger of this story, has been showed by Deinde totum illud, etc. Our
Zanchius de divine. attrib. lib. 4 cap. 4.
Zanchius to have been rather an enlarger of it, by adding unto it more then is
to be found either in the Hebrew Ben gorion. lib. 3. cap. 19. or else in the
Greek histories of Josephus, who have both recorded this story.

4 But if we should allow for disputation sake, the story to be truly
expressed, and that (which some See D. Reynolds, and Hierome Zanchie, in the
same places.
impugn) this Sacrifice had been offered by means of the Actor Iudat
Macchabaus, for the dead, and not only for the living; yet must we consider
that it was for the behoof of those dead, who had taken Jewels consecrated
unto Idols, which was forbidden by the law, Deuteronomy. 7. This was a sin, yea and
such a sin, that this The sin of Acan, Josh. 7. 1.
one was the only cause why many perished in the host of Israel: which
argues that it was an heinous sin.

5 Finally, these being now slain, the idolatrous Jewels (the matter of their
sin) 2. Machab. 12. verse. 40.
are found under the coats of every one of them: which proves, that as they
died for sin, so they died in their sin. And will our Adversaries allow
public prayers to be made for those who die in They will not. See above in the
questions of Purgatory and Sacrifice. Mortale peccatum est reatus, cui, quantum
est in sesolum, semper debetur aeterna damnatio. Vega lib. 14. de peccat. mort.
and ven. cap. 16. fol. 640.
mortal sin? But they Greg Valent. Ies. lib. de Purgat.
suppose that some of these had repented; yet because this could but only be
supposed, it may be demanded of our Adversaries, whether they will allow
public prayers to be made specially and by name for any public transgressors,
who are not known to have given any sensible testimony of repentance? How
then shall the Romanists justify this example?

6 For as in earthly building, we are not to apply the rule unto the stone, but
the stone unto the rule; so in spiritual edification, Gods To the law, and to
the testimony. Esa 8. 20.
law must not be examined by example, but example by law. And seeing (as their
Jesuit confesses) Neque certe dubitandum est quin orandi institutum pro

de ea re scriptum sit. Gregor. Valent. Iesuita, Anal. fid. lib. 8. cap. 6.. Sic

the ordinance of prayer for the dead is not found written in the law of God,
we presume his act cannot be thought lawful, in seeking a Verse. 43.
Sacrifice of sinne-offering in behalf of the slain.

7 To pretend that he was warranted by the law of some Greg. Valent. supra,
lit. l.
unwritten Tradition, is a conjecture contradicted by See hereafter cap. 8.
Sect. 4. p Leuit. 5.
our Adversaries, and oppugneth the perfection of Gods written will. For if God
did so particularly and precisely ordain in his written law p sin offerings for
trespasses of only bodily pollution by touching of the carrion of dead beasts,
would he have omitted mention of Sacrifices for the precious souls of men, if
any such had been behoouefull for the dead? Thus much of the Actor Judas.

8 Howsoever, (that we may come to speak of the authority of this story,)
our Adversaries are not ignorant, that not only all the Jews, but the most
ancient Fathers, as namely, Hierome, Ruffinus, Epiphanius, Athanasius,
Eusebius, and (to omit others,) S. Gregory did not acknowledge these books of
Maccabees for Canonical Scriptures; and consequently, not to be of authority
sufficient to patronize any doctrine of faith. And now we come to salute their
Rabbines.

themselves, saying, Ignoro milites, quae sit propitiatio animae hominis qui

be made.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Giving full demonstrations of the frivolous and
irreligious presumption of the Apologists; discovering the emptiness and
impiety of such authorities taken from the Jewish Thalmud, upon which this
part of their Romish Apology does wholly depend.

Author from whom these Apologists have borrowed their proofs, professes, that
the truth which he labors to prove, is especially taken out of the Cui

Thalmud of the Jews: and this will appear to be the nest wherein the
testimonies of those Rabbis are hatched, which are produced by Galatinus, in
his work entitled: The Secrecies of the Catholic faith; or by Coccius in
his volumes of the Treasury of the Catholic faith; or by these obiectors in
this Apology for the Catholic faith: who all, by yielding credit unto such
testimonies, have not a little prejudiced and discredited their own judgment.

It was commanded by the general consent both of diverse Popes and Christian
Princes, that the Jews themselves, who lived in the dominions of the
Christians, should be for bidden the reading of those books, as being impious,
and containing not only execrable contumelies against Christ, but very many
decrees and precepts contrary to the very law of Moses.

3 Yea, and not this only, but that Gregory the ninth did condemn all those
Thalmudicall books to the fire, Anno 1320. that Innocentius the fourth did the
like, Anno 1244. that Julius the third, Anno 1553. commanded that all those
books, which had been printed by stealth, should be sought out and burned. And
that lastly, Paulus the fourth renewed the same Decree, and noted their names
amongst the condemned books: Insomuch that out of the Jews library Ex

in Cremona, by order from the Roman Inquisition, there were burned twelve
thousand of these Thalmudicall books at one time. This may serve for the
general confutation of their Rabbinish defense. We descend unto

Their second degree of presumption, which appears by discovering the
unworthiness of the particular Rabbis by them specified, who were before or
since Christ: from the confession of our learned Adversaries.

confessed, long since to have been avouched by Epiphanius, viz. that

praedictis expositionibus deduxerunt Constitutiones quasdam superstitione and
vanitate plenas: --
Christ condemned the Tradition of the Elders, Mat. 15. which S. Paul derided,
1. Tim. 1. 4. and 7. to wit, the Jewish expositions of the Law, invented by the
Hebrew Masters, such as were Rabbi Achiba, and Rabbi Judah, from whom the
Asamonaei did take their vain and superstitious Constitutions.

5 Whereof S. Hieronymus in 3. comment. Esaiae, and in qu. ad Algasiam, 10. in
T^t. 3. scribit, has esse Constitutiones quasdam Iudaeorum, a Graecis (...)
dictas^quas primi inter Hebraeos ante Christi aduentum docuerunt Sammai, and
Hillel, quorum scholam suscepit Akibas Aquilae proselyti praeceptor, and post

Hierome is acknowledged to be further witness, saying, that those Traditions
condemned by Christ, were the (...), or second Constitutions, which had been
taught by Rabbi Sammai, and Rabbi Hillel, whose school Rabbi Akibas and Rabbi
Mayer had, whom Ioannan the son of Zachai, and Eliezer, and Joseph, and
lastly Iosue succeeded, until the last destruction of Jerusalem. Whereunto
their e Aquinas assenteth, saying, The Jewish Thalmud (which by so many Edicts
of Popes has been condemned and burned, and whereby the Jews at this day are
most governed) is partly collected out of the old Masters of the Jews, such
as were Hillel, Akiba, Joseph, and others. Which is verified also by their
Cardinal Respondeo Christum and Apostolos reprehendere -- traditiones. quas a

Bellarmine, saying, that they were Traditions of younger Rabbis, which were
condemned by Christ: from whence as from a fountain, were derived the
Traditions now contained in their Thalmud.

6 Wherefore considering that these, whom the Apologists call ancient, and old
Rabbines, were condemned by Christ, and accounted, in respect of the true and
orthodoxall Rabbines among the Jews of that time, but Young; we cannot be
otherwise persuaded, but that the Apologists intended to deceive their Readers
with their old Rabbines, as sometime the Josh. 9.
Gibeonites did Israel with molded bread, and old shoes. And for us to
think, that the Jews since Christ are stronger witnesses unto truth, then the
former, is all one as to think, the Blindness is come upon Israel. Romans 11.
25.
blinder men are, the better they can see.

7 Furthermore, of the other works of the Jews, which are less defiled with
superstition (such as is the Targum, or Chaldie Paraphrase made by Rabbi
Aquila, by Rabbi Ionathas Vzielis, and by Joseph the blind) seeing that it is
confessed ^ Thomas Aquinas in comm vtriusque epist. ad Tim. semel atque iterum

Bellarmine to be esteemed of the Church as profitable to confute the Jews,
but not of so great authority among Christians, as to make any sound argument,
because of the Thalmudicall foulness wherewith they are defiled. Then thrice
vainly has Galatinus, and out of him their Coccius, and the Apologists from
them both, endeavored to draw out of these puddles a Demonstration, that is, an
invincible argument for confirmation of the Romish faith against Protestants.
Which vanity appears yet so much more vain, because, as their Jesuit
Rabbini Hebraeorum, qui vel diuinam Scripturam exposuerunt, vel paraphrases
eidem adhibuerunt, vel in Thalmud plaeraque congesserunt, a Patribus vix vnquam
citantur. Posseuinus Apparat. sacr. part. 2. Tit. Rabbini.
Posseuinus observes, The Jewish Rabbis who have either expounded Scriptures,
or compiled the Thalmud, are scarce once cited by the ancient Fathers, no not
so much as against the Jews themselves: and must such bolts taken from the
Jews be thus fastened upon Christians? Now that we have broken this impostume
of their swelling Demonstration, we answer unto the Prayer then used for the
dead.

8 Symeon Ben Iohai bewrays himself by the title of the book, which is,
Reuelatio secretorum. Apolog. page 25. lit. f.
A Revelation of Secrets. For if the practice of praying for the dead had been
always so general, then was it no secret; if it needed a new Revelation, then
was it not before his time general or Catholic. And finally we appeal from
Rabbi Symeon, Rabbi Kimki, Rabbi Hascana, unto Moses in his Pentateuch, and the
true Prophets of God; and knowing, that this Article of prayer for the dead is
not revealed in such Scriptures, it may be judged no better then a doctrine
Thalmudicall.

9 And lastly, why shall our Adversaries deny us that liberty of renouncing
the Jewish Doctors, (where they reject the truth of Scripture,) which they do
assume unto themselves? as when Cardinal Bellarmine accounts it a Jewish
fondness to think, that Rabbi Solomon in cap. 9. Genesis vult esse reum
homicidij, qui non dat operam liberis: and R. David Kimchi in cap. 58. Esa.
ait, esse sententiam Iudaeorum, eos qui non relinquunt filium, esse tanquam
excommunicatos a Deo. Bellar. lib. 2. de Monachis, cap. 6.
he should be a murderer, who did not apply himself unto the procreation of
children, although Rabbi Solomon taught thus much: or to contemn the doctrine
which says, that he is an excommunicate from God, who leaves not a male-child
to succeed him after his death; albeit this opinion be by Rabbi David Kimchi
attributed unto the ancient Jews.

CHAP. IIII. Of Limbus Patrum.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Secondly concerning Limbus Patrum, the book entitled Ecclesiasticus, though
we should for the time suppose it not to be Canonical Scripture, yet was it
collected or penned before Christ's time, and by such an Author as then before
In the Prologue of the book of Ecclesiasticus, ante med.

their Fathers, and had gotten therein sufficient knowledge.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.

not Canonical. Notwithstanding if they shall furthermore suppose, that every
one who should bear witness unto himself, that he had given himself to the
reading of the law and the Prophets, and of their Fathers, had gotten therein
sufficient knowledge, could confirm any Article of doctrine: then might every
Cabalisticall and Thalmudicall Rabbin be equalled with Ecclesiasticus. But
first to the matter, and then to the Author.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
In this book is our Saviors descending into that place specially foretold
us, where it is said in his person: Ecclesiasticus 24. 37.
I will pierce through the lower parts of the earth, I will look upon all such
as be asleep, and will lighten all them that trust in the Lord: a saying so
direct This piercing through the lower parts of the earth, to lighten those
that were there asleep, and trusted in the Lord, argues plainly that those
faithful so asleep (or dead) were not then in heaven: for by the lower parts
of the earth, cannot be meant heaven.
and pertinent, that M. WHITAKER seeks to euade by these two only ways, as
first in answering, that Whitaker contra Dureum, l. 8. page 567. post med.

false,) etc.

2 M. Whitaker has said, The words objected, [as out of Ecles. 24. 37. I will

false. Which notwithstanding is so manifestly true, that not only the Sea the

does confess of these words, that they Eccles. 24. Penetrabo etc.] Hic locus

Coccius, when he labored to prove this point from Coccius Tom. 1. lib. 2.
art. 7. Asserunt sacrae Scripturae, etc.
Scriptures, pretermitted this Text, as in that respect impertinent. Therefore
the falsification used by the Romish Apologists is more notorious, in that they
themselves then falsify, even in their accusing their Adversary of notorious
falsehood.

3 Notwithstanding in the marginall note they pretend a reason of their
taxation, taken from the English translation of the Bible: but so, as that
thereby their delusion becomes more gross, as the places The English Bible
alleged by the Apologists (which is commonly called the Geneua Bible) in the
title of the first page, says: The Bible, that is, The Scriptures contained in
the old and new Testament, translated according unto the Hebrew and Greek,
does mean only the books Canonical, which Protestants call (...), The
Bible, and The Scriptures: but in translating the Apocrypha books, they have
taken more liberty, as nam^ly sometime to insert the verses taken out of the
Latin, which are not in the Greek, but yet with a note of difference expressed
in these characters, or list [ ] purposely thereby distinguishing that which
was not taken out of the Greek, from the verses of the Greek text it self:
which note of [ ] they have also for the same distinction sake used in this
verse, as they do often in the same chap. ver. 1. 3. 4. 6. 9. 21. 23. 25. 26.

objected do show. Finally, if that they had not intended rather to blindfold
their Reader then enlighten their own judgment, why did they not specify any
one Greek copy which had those words? Is not this a profound negligence to
examine what are the words of the Greek text by the English, and not by the
Greek? If they (which is not probable) were ignorant of Greek, yet might they
have used the spectacles of other men's learning, and not so rashly have
condemned so excellently learned a Doctor of notorious falsehood, in his so
faithful and conspicuous an answer.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
False, for the English Bible (to omit others) of Anno 1576. purporting by the
title on the first page thereof, to be translated according to the Hebrew and
Greek, has these words; translated accordingly.

for a secret, it may be judged still worthy of secrecy.

tells us, that the Jews of those times before Christ did not understand
this mystery.

7 As for the other new Jewish Rabbis, they are as new wine venting out their
lees: of which kind is that custom, when in their feasts of Sabboths they
pour out their consecrated wine upon the dry ground, believing, that Vinum
effundunt (in the celebration of the Sabbath:) opinantur plerique effusionem

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 5.
8 Here the Apologists do not only digress from their purpose (which was
only to demonstrate their faith from the Jewish religion,) when now they
insert a proof out of the new Testament: but they also transgress, by abusing
their reader through misconstruction of a place of Scripture mentioned in their
marginall note. For the Apostles words, saying of the Patriarks of the old
Testament, that they had not received the promises, that they (namely the
Jews,) without us, (viz. Christians) should not be made perfect, do not
signify (as the Apologists pretend) that their souls expected an entrance
into heaven at Christ's coming, lest that they might have been perfected before
Christians: but they betoken the full perfection of both body and soul, which
shall be accomplished in the day of resurrection, as Cardinal Tertio dico per
repromissi onem intelligi perfectam beatitudinem corporis and animae, quam illi
adhuc non habuerunt, ne sine nobis habeant. Quae quidem est com munis Patrum
expositio in cu^ locum: and Augustini, tract. 49. in Ioh. Notanda sunt illa
verba, [Ne sine nobis consummarentur;] non ait, Ne sine nobis remunerarentur;
sed ne sine nobis consummatam mercedem non modo animae, sed etiam corporis
acciperent. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Beat. Sanct. cap. 3.. Tertio dico.
Bellarmine in his last resolution has confessed, induced thereunto by (as he
calls it) the common exposition of ancient Fathers, and also from the
strength of the text; wherein S. Augustine will have us to observe that it is
said, Lest that they (Patriarks) without us (Christians) should not be
consummated: He says not (says S. Augustine,) lest that without us they
should not be rewarded. So then they may by this text as well prove a Limbus of
Christian Apostles, as of Jewish Patriarks.

9 Other places of Scriptures and authorities of Fathers have been See above
lib. 2. cap. 9.
already sufficiently satisfied, where our conclusion was, that Protestants
professing, that the Patriarks were by Christ his merits and death delivered
(as were all the elect) from hell by prevention, that is, that they should
never come thither, do hereby magnify the power of Christ's death more then do
the defenders of their deliverance from hell by subuention, that is, by a
removing them from thence: as may be plain by an example taken out of their
Galatinus, where the Prophet David says, Psalm 85. Liberasti animam meam ab
inferno inferiore. -- Legitur Rabbi Iodden sic dixisse, Via Adulterorum data
est in profundum inferni. -- Vbi Glossa Rabbi Solomonis: -- Liberasti me, cum
dixit mihi Nathan, Dominus quoque transtulit peccatum tuum. G^latinus Arc.
Cathol. ver^^. lib. 6. cap. 9.
Thou have delivered my soul from the lowest hell. Whereby is meant, according
to the exposition of Jewish Rabbis, that David repenting of his adultery, was
by the mercy of God delivered out of the hell of the damned, when Nathan said
unto him: God has translated thy punishment, even out of the hell of the
damned; not by a deliverance privative, as though he had been once in that
hell, but by a deliverance negative, that he should never come there.

10 Notwithstanding if any Protestants have condescended unto the former
opinion, then we say; as the same doctrine thereby is not made more true, so
neither are those Doctors less hopeful of life, because it is no such matter
as may prejudice any essential point of faith: yet may not other lose their
liberty of trying all things, nor neglect their duty in choosing the more
apparent good.

CHAP. V. Of Freewill.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY:
3 Thirdly, as concerning Freewill, it is said in the foresaid book of
Ecclesiasticus not only of Adam, who was then dead, and his sin past, but by
way of admonition to the men of that time, and against their sins then to
come: Ecclesiastic. 15. 12, 15, 16, 17.
Say not thou, he has caused me to err; if thou will, thou shall observe the
commandments: he has set water and fire before thee, stretch out thy hand to
which thou will. Before man is life and death, good and evil, what likes him,
shall be given him. A saying so plain, that M. Whitaker therefore says
thereof: d^ loco Ecclesiastici parum laboro etc. Whitaker in respons. ad
rations Campiani, rat. 1. page 15. ante med.
I make small account of the place of Ecclesiasticus, neither will I believe
the freedom of man's will, although he should affirm an hundredth times, that
before man were life and death.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
IF Doctor Whitaker, in contending for an evidence of truth, and desiring
speedily to find her in her proper abode, (which is the divine Scriptures,)
and not being patient of delay and hinderance by opposition of the book of
Ecclesiasticus, (which upon due and acknowledged proof will be found to be
insufficient for confirmation of a matter of faith,) did therefore not regard
the authority of that book, he deserved therein the commendation of that
dutiful and faithful servant, who in Gods hasty business is commanded to
^^a. 10. 4.
salute no man by the way: not that he thought the place of such difficulty,
as not able to be answered.

2 For if it be understood of the perfect state of man in the first creation,
every See above lib. 2. cap. 10. Sect. 3.
Protestant confesses a free will in Adam; if of the state of corruption after
his fall, then we say with the Apostle, that man captiuated and enthralled
himself in the bondage of sin: and all such sentences are not testimonies of
strength of will in grace, but documents of his loss, and therein
Schoolemasters to draw him out of nature unto grace by the power of Gods
Spirit, which works all in all. But let us hear the Rabbis speak.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And ancient Philo who lived in Christ's time, affirms in like manner, that
Philo in libio, quod Deus sit immutabilis.
man has freewill, etc. to which purpose (says he) is extant the Oracle in
Deuteronomie, I have placed before thee life and death, good and evil; choose
life: whereunto might be added no less plain sayings of the other old Jewish
Rabbi Moyles filius Maimon, in epistola aduersus Astrologos, says: Ac illud
quidem intelligere debetis, praecituum ac principale ex fundamentis legis
nostrae, omnesque item Philosophos aperte confiteri, quaecunque ab ipsis
hominibus fiunt, ea in ipsorum manu esse ac potestate, etc. Si velit home,
seruit Domino, etc. sin placet adi^^ consilia impiorum, and illud quoque facit.
And see the other no less plain sayings of Rabbi Moses Hadarsan in cap. 4.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
3 And what if it be confessed, that some Rabbis maintained the liberty of
man's will, as Rabbi Moses did? who (as See lit. g.
appears by his sentence alleged by the Apologists in the margent) does make
Philosophers the Patrons of that same free will. And Philo is described by
their Senensis, to have been Hic vir fuit Pvthagoricae, Platonicae, and
Aristotelicae philosophiae peritia omnibus suae memoriae hominibus facile
superior, -- vnde etiam ab ipsis Graecis Plato Iudaeus dictas est, abijtque de

Posseuin. Ies. Apparat. part. 2.
a man fraught with the learning of Pythagoricall, Platonicall, and
Aristotelical Philosophy; of whom the Greeks for his Philosophical skill,
raised this proverb, viz. Either does Philo play Plato his part, or else Plato
does act the person of Philo. Now who knows not, that blindness in natural
Philosophy is so great (especially in judging of the properties of the soul,)
that Tertullian (as is observed by Cardinal De origin animae. -- Ex errore
Stoicorum natus est error Manichaei and Priscilliani ^ex errore Platonis, error
Origenis; ex errore Aristotells, vel certe ex Aristotelis sententia non been

Bellarmine,) did not doubt to call Philosophers the Patriarks of Heretics.

4 So dangerous a matter it is for Christians to suffer Philosophy to usher
Divinity, whereas it ought to be an handmaid thereunto, and therefore as often
as she shall wander into the wilderness of error, ought to be sent home unto
divine learning, as was Agar the bondmaid Genesis 16.
commanded to return unto Sarah her mistress. Otherwise shall man be easily
misled by Philo, who (as he is alleged) does make Non enim e^^se humana men^

good, preferring nature before grace: which as has been confessed by our
Adversaries,) is the heresy of See above lib. 2. cap. 10.

seem rather to overthrow the questioned free will, and to Philo Iudaeus lib 4.

yield all power and strength of any good unto God.

5 In brief, Doctor Fulks sentence (if the Apologists had done him justice to
have repeated it right) would have appeared justifiable in it self against the
later Jews: The Jewish Rabbis (says he) patrons of free will, as ignorant of
the grace of God, err in this place, as they do in a thousand more. The
Apologists (we confess) wanted no art, when they left out these words, [as
ignorant of the grace of God:] whereby he meant not altogether to take
exception unto free will, but only unto such a kind of natural freedom in
electing of good, which is void and destitute of the help of effectual grace.
The doctrine of Protestants in this point has been confirmed both by
testimonies of See above lib. 2. cap. 10.
Fathers, and the confessions of our learned Ibid.
Adversaries.

CHAP. VI. Of Gods induration of man's heart.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
4 Fourthly, as concerning Gods induration or hardening of Pharaohs heart, the
Jewish Rabbis are so plain in affirming with us, the same to be by Gods
permission, and not by his working (which exposition Calvin Instit. l. 2. c. 4.
sect. 3. initio.
Calvin disliketh in the ancient Fathers,) that Peter Martyr Peter Martyr in
epist. ad Romans c. 9.
and Munster Munster. annot. in Exodus c. 7
do accordingly acknowledge this their aforesaid exposition.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
HEre we cannot tell whether we are to complain of the Apologists for want of
judgment, or of conscience: for neither does M. Calvin deny permission, nor
do the Jesuits themselves admit only a permission in the act of induration of
a wicked man's heart. First, Tentationes quae adueniunt, non sunt fortuitae, nec
Satanae voluntate permotae sine permissione Dei; milites a Judah instructi,
permissione Patris filium comprehenderunt; diabolus exercet tyrannidem in mundo
permissione Dei: Iudaeos non potuisse Dominum morti tradere, nisi Deus
permisisset. Caluinus com. in Matthew. cap. 4. 8. and 26. 27.
all temptations (says M. Calvin) are by permission of God, and by Gods
permission it is, that the devil exercises his tyranny amongst men. Again,
Laudo veterum modestiam, quod caecitatem and obstinationem improborum ad solam
permissionem diuinam, non ad operationem retulerunt, vt nullam occasionem
relinquerent de operibus Dei male sentiendi. Idem Institut. cap. 4.. 3. Non
reijcimus vocem permissionis and concessionis, and nunquam nobis in mentem
venit dicere, Deum operari (meaning sin) in impijs. Beza Aphoris. 29.
I commend (says he) the modesty of ancient Fathers, that they attributed the
act of obduration of the wicked only unto Gods permission, rather then to give
an occasion unto men sinisterly to conceit, that God is the author of sin.
Which though M. Calum c. Aug. lib. 5. con. Pelag. cap. 3.
does religiously abhor: yet notwithstanding he proceeds further then a
permission, but under the conduct of S. Augustine (or rather of the Spirit of
God in Scripture,) saying, that sins are not only acts of Gods patience, but
also of his power, thereby punishing sin by a manner inexplicable, whereby he
is ineffably just.

2 This doctrine seems to our Adversaries to be immodest and impious, when it
passes from Caluins quill, which being delivered by their own Jesuits would
peradventure deserve their approbation. Thus then Pererius and Suarez, two
learned Jesuits: Deus facit multa intra cum hominem, qui obduratur, quibus,
vitio suo as fit deterior. Excitat in eo varios affectus, vel motus spei,
fiduciae, cupiditatis, vel^tae, varias imaginationes and cogitationes, and
somnia, quibus ille nimio plus credulus, incitatur ac praecipitatur in malum.
-- Et August. lib. 5. contra^ulian. disputat, Deum in Scriptura dici quo^dam
indurare and excaecare, and tradere in reprobum sensum, non solum per
patientiam and pe^mi ^onem, sed per quandam potentiam and quasi actionem. -- Ex
occulta Dei prouidentia iustissima plan^ and sapientissim^. Percrius Iesuita
com. in Exodus ca. 11. De indur. disp. 8. The same is the determination of
Suarez. See at the letter f. following.
God works many things in him that is hardened, whereby the wicked man is made
worse by his own fault, not only (as says S. Augustine) by permitting, but
by a certain power, and (as it were) action, through his secret, but yet most
just and wise providence.

3 The doctrine of Calvin and other Protestants, being so consonant to the due
acknowledgement of their own Jesuits, we wonder with what minds the Apologists
do cast their Reader this bait of Induration, except it be to entitle Calvin
and his brethren unto that heresy, which makes God to be the author of sin,
as many Deum esse causam peccati docet Caluinus. Bellarm. lib. 4. de ^ccles
milit. cap. 9.. Deinde. Feu-ardent. com. in Iac. 1. page 108. Campian. Rat. 7.

Romanists have done: but unconscionably, because the objection is easily
assoiled by the distinction of their own School, wherein their Jesuit Suarez
has determined, that Operatur Deus actum peccati, non autem malriam eius.
Suarez Ies. varijs opusc. Relect. de libert. volunt. divine. disp. 1.. 2. number.
14. Moguntiae 1600.
God, in obdurating men, works the act, but not the malice thereof. More
plainly their Canus, Deus est naturalis causa etiam peccatorum, non autem
moralis, hoc est, non suadet, non approbat. Canus loc. Theol. lib. 2. cap. 4.
God works only as a cause natural, not as a cause moral. Which their
Vegas has well illustrated by a similitude: Quem^^modum vinum Scripturae

Trident. lib. 5. cap. 15.
When an expert scribe (says he) writing with an evil pen does make a blot,

the naughtiness of the pen: and yet will the scribe be offended with the pen,
and sometime in anger throw it into the fire. Now Ezech 18.
are your ways equal (says God,) and are my ways unequal?

4 As for the Protestants, they stand acquitted from the objected blasphemy,
even by the sentence of their own learned Jesuit Suarez, who affirms of
them, that they deny that God inclines men unto the formal act of sin.
Which point (if need had been) might have been justified by many See this

CHAP. VII. Of the Invocation of Angels and Saints.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
5 Fifthly, as concerning Angels and Saints, the book of Toby written so many
ages before Christ, is s^ Toby 5. 5. 12. 12. 12. 15. 18.
plain with us concerning the patronage and intercession of Angels, that M.
Whitaker does therefore accordingly confess and say thereof: Whittaker in
respons. ad rations Campiani, rat. 1. page 15. ante med.
Illam vero Tobiae Raphaelem, etc. Little do we regard the example of Raphael
the Angel mentioned in Tobie; neither do we acknowledge those Of the like
number of seven Angels, which M. Whittaker so misliketh: see Revel. 1. 4. and 5
^
seven Angels whereof he speaks: all this is different from the Canonical
Scriptures, and sauoreth I know not of what superstition.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
Boldness has said, that M. Whitaker did therefore not regard the example of
Raphael, because the place was so plain for the patronage and intercession of
Angels: whereas sincerity would have acknowledged, that D. Whitaker said
plainly, Patrocinium quoddam Angelis minime denegamus. -- Sed aliud tu
patrocinium Augelorum defendis, eosque a nobis colendos and inuocandos esse
statuis: quod quidem Scriptura disertissime prohibet. Whittakerus resp. ad
Camp. rat. 1. page 17.
We gainsay not all patronage of Angels, but that (speaking unto the Jesuit
Campian) which you defend, whereby you are drawn to invoke them. And then
should they, in discretion, have distinguished between the patronage of tuition
or ministration, and of intercession, whereby men are induced to perform unto
them the worship of Invocation; whereof there is no syllable of proof in the
whole book of Tobie. So that the judgment of that learned Doctor was plainly
this, to dislike the doctrine of the invocation of Angels, because (his own
words) it is contrary unto Scripture; and also to reject the authority of
this book, because (as some Romanists confess) See above cap. 1.
neither the Jews, See it plentifully proved hereafter in the last book.
nor yet the primitive Christian Churches did hold it Canonical.

2 Also it would require an Answer to know how that part of the story can
consist, wherein the Angel Gabriel does report himself to have been Tob. 5.
12.
of the kindred of Azarias, and of the brethren of Tobias, which was a mortal
generation; and yet in the end he does affirm, that he was Tob. 12. 15.
Raphael one of the seven Angels, which are immortal, and without generation:
which if their Cardinal Bellar. lib. 1. de verbo Dei, ca. 11.
Bellarmine, or Senens. Bibl. l. 8 de libro Tobiae.
. Senensis had thought to have been reconciliable, they would doubtless have
shown as much, especially in those Treatises, wherein they undertook the
defense of this book of Tobie, to justify it to be Canonical; and yet this
is not the greatest exception which S^e Lubbertus de principijs dogmatum, upon
this book.
some have taken unto the truth of that story.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
In like manner does the book of Macchabees make mention how Judas Machabaeus
2. Macchab. 15. 12, 13, 14.
saw in a vision Onias the high Priest (who was then before slain) See 2.
Macchab. 3. 33. and 4. 34.
holding up his hands toward heaven, and praying for the people, after which
there appearrd to him another man who was aged etc. And Onias spoke and said,
This is a lover of the brethren who prays much for the people, and for the
whole City, (to wit) Ieremias the Prophet of God: A place so direct for the
intercession of Saints, that M. Whitaker (p) Whittaker in respons. ad rations
Campiani, page 16. circa medium, says, Illud Iudae de Onia somnium, quod 2.
Macchab. 15. legimus, vt somnium praetermitto, sed pa^um refert mortuorum sieve
intercessionem, sieve sacrificium intelligas, vtrumque tuum est, vtrumque est
falsum.
does therefore contemn it.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
3 It may not be called a contempt of this book, if it be contemned in respect
of Canonical Scripture, no more then it may be thought a disgrace for a man to
be abased, when as he stands in comparison with God. But what is the evidence
of the place, that any Protestant should therefore contemn it? The foundation
of all is a vision of Macchabaus in a dream, wherein he seemed to see 2.
Macchab. 15. 12. ver. 15. and 16.
Ieremias the Prophet holding out his right hand, and giving unto Judas a sword
of gold, and as he gave it, he spoke thus: Take this sword a gift from God,
wherewith thou shall wound thy adversaries.

4 What will our Adversaries say? have the souls departed hands? did Jeremy
truly give unto Judas a golden sword, which was but only made of fancy in a
dream? This teaches us that, visions are not always to be expounded
literally, as things done, but as if they had been done. And this was the
comfort of this vision which Macchabaeus was to conceive, namely, to think that
God would bless his battle taken in defense of his worship, eue^ as if those
holy men Onias and Jeremy had personally interceded in that behalf, or as if
he had sent a golden sword unto the same Judas Macchabaeus, as a pledge of his
promised favor and protection. Neither can our Adversaries from intercession
of Saints for us, make any good inference of See this proved above, lib. 2.
our invocation of them, which is the maine point, and which they endeavor to
prove by a pretty fancy following.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And it is to be observed further as very probable, that the Jews present at
our Saviors death, could not have been so easily persuaded to think and say,
that our Savior saying, Mat. 27. 46, 47, 49. and Marc. 15. 34, 35, 36.
Eli Eli Lammasabacthani, called Helias, if the invocation of Saints had not
been as then familiar and usual to them: which their opinion appears yet
more evidently, as well by further testimony of the ancient See Flauius
Josephus de bello iudaico, l. 3. c 14. where it is said, Purae animae quae
exaudiunt inuocantes, retinent locum in coelo adeptae sanctissimum And Josephus
Bengorion in Bello Iudaico, cap. 21. where it is said, Exurge nunc Moses sili
Amram, and vide populum tui^c, exurge nunc Aaron, etc. And R. Abraham in Genesis

SECT. 3.
5 That argument taken from that speech of the bystanders, saying, He calls
upon Elias, let us now see if Elias will help him; concluding thereupon that
it had been an usual and familiar practice among the Jews to call upon their
Prophets and holy Saints departed, is observed by the Apologists as very
probable: which collection their Jesuit Ex quo colligimus, motis fuisse
ludzoru^, vt in tubulatione positi non solum ad Deu^, sed etiam ad sanctos
Prophetas accurrerent. Salmeron Ies. tom. 10. tract. 43.
Salmeron also does not a little approve: although indeed it be far out of
joint.

6 Because (to yield unto the moderation of their other Doctors) they that said
that Christ called upon Elias for help, were either Gentiles, who were Roman
soldiers, or Jews: If Gentiles, Communiter traduntur fuisse Romani, vt putat
Hieron. -- Alij sentiunt illos potius suisse Hebraeos, qui cruci assistebant:

Ioh. 19 29. cos, qui acetum Christo porrexerunt, milites fuisse dicunt.
Maldonat. Ies. com. in Matthew. 27. 47.
Maldonate, and Bishop Hos Hieronymus arbitratur fuisse milites Romanos, qui
quoniaem non intellexerunt Hebraici sermonis proprietatem. -- Id eo magis

illos ^ccisle more sibisolito, vt Dominum in becillitatis infamarent, qui Elae
auxilium deprecetur. Card. I ansen. concord Euang. c. 142. in eumlocum.
Iansenius by good proofs do consent; then is the foresaid argument but
heathenish: for the heathens (we know) did invoke many Gods.

7 But admit we that they were Jews, who must have been either of the vulgar
sort, or else of the literate and skillful in the law: if but of the vulgar
rank, then may we think they erred, by reason (which Maldonate notes) of
their See above at the letter, c.
ignorance of Scriptures; and so their argument is unreasonable, which has no
better patronage then ignorance.

8 If they object the speech, as proceeding from the opinion of the learned
Jews: then (that we may suppose this which their own Doctors have denied)
these must have spoken those words either in earnest, or in scorn: If we
understand it to have been spoken in earnest, (whereof notwithstanding there is
no proof,) yet does it not necessarily concern the Invocation of Saints
departed, but of the living; because some Jews held an opinion (as their Viuere
enim credebatur Elias, and apparere aliquando nonnullis. Arias Montanus in eum
locum.
Arias Montanus observes) that Elias yet living did sometimes appear unto
men: and so the argument is insufficie^t, concluding an Invocation of the dead
from an Invocation of a person living.

9 If lastly it may be thought to have been spoken in scorn and contempt of
Christ (as by the confessions of our See the testimonies already alleged.
Adversaries, some Fathers have affirmed,) then is their argument, being taken
from mockery, apparently frivolous. And thus is their probable argument become
by four necessary suppositions either heathenish, or childish, or
impertinent, or ridiculous.

10 The next confirmation which they use out of the Rabbis, is a mixture of
two errors: the first is the Flauius Josephus de bello Iudaico lib. 3. cap.
14. after the Greek, cap. 25. And Russinus expounds the Greek word (...)
passiuely, audiuntur; translating that place of Josephus.
translation of the Greek word (...) contrary unto the scope of the text: for
Josephus dissuading men from murdering themselves for fear of danger, says,
that this is all one as if a man should steal away his Lords pledge: but he
that shall stay Gods call, is like him who pays his rent at the time
appointed. Of the former kind he says, they are in the darkness of hell, but
pronounces of the other, that they are pure souls, and (...), that is,
attentive, or obedient unto God. Secondly they err together with their
conducter Coccius by misconstruction: for Josephus Ben-gorion de bello Iudaico,
cap. 21. as it is cited by Coccius, whom these Apologists follow, though it be
misquoted, wherein only as a Rhetorical prosopopoeia: for therein he calls
up Phinees, Surge nunc Phinees. -- Transsige in furore tuo seditiosos: Tu David
Rex Domini, expergisecre cum strepitu Citherarum: and of Elias, Libera
reliquias Israel, quemadmodum traxit castra syrorum.
Joseph Ben-gorion that says, Arise Moses and behold thy people, rise up Aaron
thou holy Priest of God, calls also upon Phinees to arise, and to pierce
through the seditious in his wrath: and upon David, to awake, and come with the
noise of his harp. Which their learning could not but teach them to be
rhetorical prosoperies: such as were the speeches of Scriptures in calling
upon the Often in the Psalms.
creatures of heaven and earth, and contained in them a justice of hearing and
praising the Lord. But behold

The Apologists argument for Invocation, taken from the doctrine of the ancient
Jews, confuted by the profession of the truly ancient Jews: from the
confession of our learned Adversaries.

11 What is it that the Apologists prove from these Jewish Rabbis? They have
said, that it is a familiar and usual custom of praying unto Saints: as did
likewise their Jesuit Salmeron; not considering what their own Roman Rabbis

confessed, viz. that it was not usual among the Jews, to pray unto the
souls of Patriarks, because they were not in the state of blessedness, or
able to know the prayers of the living: neither was it their manner to pray
directly unto them, as to say, Father Abraham pray for us; but to invoke in
their names. Finally, that See above lib. 2. cap. 12.
this was not taught unto the people of the old Testament before Christ, for
fear of Idolatry; nor at their first conversion unto the faith of Christ,
because the Jews would have thought it an hard thing to be instructed to pray
unto souls departed. So learned have these Apologists been in painted
Sophistry, whereof they shall give their Reader a further taste in the Article
following.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 3.
3 Paulus Fagius does indeed confess (as their own Coccius has cited him,)
that Per Mosem: Apol. it follows in Fagius. Sic vt came primus omnium Joshua a
Mose acceperit, quam postea senioribus, illi deinceps Prophetis prioribus,
Prophetae priores postremis, -- hi tradiderunt viris Synagogae magnae, qui
scilicet fuerunt Esdras cum suo sodalitio, -- ab illis acceperunt succedentes
sapientes succedentibus generationibus, atque istam geminam legis expositionem,
quam hodie adhuc apud sapientes suos inuenir^ gloriantur Iudaei, and alio
nomine Cabalam vocant. As he is cited by Coccius Thesaur. Cath. Tom. 1. lib. 6.
art. 6. page 780.
It is the opinion of the Jews, that Moses did receive two laws of God in
Mount Sinai, the one written, and the other unwritten; and this later to have
been commended by word of mouth without writing by Moses unto Joshua; by him
unto the Elders of Israel; by them unto the Prophets, and by them unto the
Masters of the great Synagogue under Esdras; from whom the wise men following
did successively receive it. And this double manner of exposition of the law,
the Jews at this day do glory to be among them, which they call Cabala.

4 What now has our learned Fagius confessed? that the ancient Jews do
affirm the unwritten law? So the Romish Apologists pretend: but he only
relates the opinion of the Jews at this day, who do think that their Cabala
or Reception of unwritten Traditions was derived by continual succession from
Moses unto their Chachamin and late wizzards: which may be confirmed by the
confession of their own Petrus Galatinus, their principal Doctor and
conductor in this question: for thus he; Neque vllam eius (viz Cabalae)
particulam Scripturae mandari licebat. Vnde praeter ea quae a Rabbi Symeon
filio Ioai tradita asseruntur, alia a veteribus scripta vel pauca, vel nulla
comperiuntur. -- Cabalam, quod receptio Latin^ interpretatur, vocitarunt;
Recentiorum autem Iudaeorum Doctores, ne patemum illud dogma euanesceret, de
huiusmodi facultate aliquid scripto in lucem ediderunt, sparsim tamen, ac
nonnullis velaminibus obumbratum. Galatinus arcan. fid. lib. 1. cap. 6.
Quocirca neque mirum est si nomen hoc Cabala, sieve facultas eo nomine
designata, raro hucusque in Sanctorum, caeterorumque sapientum ore habita sit,
and si de ipsa veteres non nostri meminerint, ex iunioribus tamen quidam
linguam Hebraicam callentes -- de ipsa multa scripserunt. nam Johannes quidem
Picus primus de ea quasi de longinquo, aliqua suspicari coepit. Galatinus lib.
1. cap. 6. versus finem.
This Cabala, or receipt (which might not lawfully be committed to writing) the
later Jewish Doctors have published in writing. Now do we approach to our
trial, first showing

That the Church of the Jews, in, or after the days of Moses received no
unwritten Traditions from God: by the confession of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
5 Non desunt aliqui Catholicorum, qui negant vllam fuisse Tradition^ non
scriptam apud Iudaeos. Bellarm. lib. 4. de verbo non scripto, cap. 8.. His add.
Some Catholics (says their Cardinal Bellarmine) have denied that the Jews
had any unwritten Traditions committed unto them: and that this may be affirmed
Catholikely, their Bishop Iansenius will warrant us, who affirms, that Quod
vni Iudaeorum populo per Mosem diligenter satis perscripta essent quaecunque ad
religionem pertinerent, and iustitiam inter homines seruandam. Iansenius
Concird. Euang. cap. 120. in haec verba, Quaecunque dixerint, facite.
Moses delivered unto the people of the Jews all those things which concerned
either religion toward God, or justice toward men. Which might be easily
euinced by answering the objections which our Adversaries do usually make: but
seeing truth by showing it self does discover the untruth, therefore we
proceed to make known,

That the Traditions professed by the Jews, now objected, were humane
figments, and condemned by Christ: proved by the confession of our Romish
Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
6 Our Savior Christus (Mat. 15.) Traditiones eas reprehendit, quas Iudaei
acceperant a quibusdam recentioribus quarum aliquae inanes, aliquae perniciosae
erant, and contra Scripturas. Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 10.. Argumen.
3.
Christ (as Cardinal Bellarmine says) reprehended those Traditions which the
Jews had then received from their younger Rabbis: yet those younger Masters are
they whom the Apologists called See above c. 3.. 2.
ancient Jews, and old Rabbis before Christ. Whose Traditions (whether it
were by way of corrupt expounding of Scripture, or by ordaining new doctrines)
are those Josephus Iudaeorum vernaculus, indicat multas constitutiones a
maioribus per manus successione acceptas Pharisaeos populo tradidisse, quae
scriptae non essent inter leges Mosaicas. -- Antiq. lib. 13. cap. 17. -- Has,

(...), that is, secundarie Traditions, which were condemned by Christ, and c

above ibid.
the Authors of them S. Hierome did often whip. And how then shall the
Apologists and such like patrons escape this his lash? For their desert is
apparent, in that they, for proof of many Romish Tradidions, do produce the
testimonies not only of the declining Jews before Christ, but also of the
apostate Jews since Christ: concerning whom we prove,

That the unwritten Traditions, which the Jews since Christ do profess and
protend to have been delivered by Moses, and so successively from the Priests
and Prophets of the old Testament unto them, are untruly avouched by them in
maintenance both of their Thalmud, and Cabala: by the confession of our
Adversaries.
SECT. 6.
7 We know that the Apologists will be willing to hear their own Galatinus
speak, who is their chief director in this cause. Ad illud postremo quod
Iudaei Thalmudicas traditiones a Deo Mosi simul in monte Sinai traditas fuisse,
deinde a Mose priscis patribus succedaneo ordine reuelatas, and demum per
antiquos eorum Doctores conscriptas in Thalmud asserunt, dico quod id de
omnibus quae sunt in Thalmud, credere est quam praecipitatae mentis insania.
Galatinus de arcanis verit. Cathol. lib. 1. cap. 7. page 25.
I say (says he) that it is a mere madness for any to approve all those
unwritten Traditions, which the Jews will have thought to have been delivered
in Mount Sinai, and from thence orderly to have descended unto posterity. And
of the Cabala he intimates that the ancient Fathers did not acknowledge that
Cabala, but the first whom he can find to have regarded it, was Picus Earl of
Mirandula: which is the judgment of their Rabbi Symeo^ Caballicorum Princeps,
cuius Cabala legaliu^ rerum arcana, spiritualem allegoricamque intelligentiam
continens, Patrum tantum temporibus per Mirandulanum Principem in lucem exijt.
Genebrard Chron. lib. 2. anno Christi 69. page 224.
Genebrard, saying, that Rabbi Simeon was the first among the Jews, who
committed it to writing, and Picus the first among Christians that published
it, who (as their Mortuus est anno 1494. Senens. Bibl. lib 4. Tit. Johannes
Picus.
Senensis records) died in the year of Christ 1494. and whose work called
Heptaplus, which was fraught with Cabalisticall expositions, Quidam Doctores
(speaking of his work of Heptaplus) contemnunt vt iuuenilis audaciae
ostentamentum, extrinsecus tumidum, intus prorsus inane. Senensis ibidem. Paulo
ante.
diverse Doctors (meaning Romanists) did condemn as a vainglorious flourish of
a young brain.

8 Carolus Sigonius brings in S. Hierome complaining of their Traditions,
which they pretend to come from Quas traditiones declarans Hieron. in epist.
151. sic inquit: Quantae Traditiones Pharisaeorum sint, quas hodie vocant

fraught with innumerable blasphemies against God and his Christ our Savior,
and impieties against the law of Moses, besides other infinite fooleries.
Execration will not suffer us to mention their blasphemies, for (as the
Philosopher said of dead carcasses,) The stinch of them does enforce us to
bury them. Other their impieties and superstitious fancies we may more safely
report, but sparingly, for much of this kind cannot but be loathsome unto
regenerate hearts. Know then,

That the Rabbis since Christ, exceed the Pharisaicall Rabbis in folly and
wickedness of their pretended ancient Traditions: which appears in manifold
particulars.
SECT. 7.
9 When Christ conuersed among the Jews, it was thought lawful Christus
tempore suo sic ratiocinatus est: Quod si vobis permissum esse putatis die
Sabbatino pecus aliquod e fosla, vt istud in vita conseruetur, eximere, quanto
magis homo quam p^cus multo pluris aestimandus est. Matthew. 11.

a transgression to remove either Iudaei in Thalmud in Tract. de Sabb. cap. 5.

extrahendum. Buxdorfius.
beast or man upon that day. For we read of a Munsterus in hist. Saxonica
narrat de Iudaeo quodam, qui die Sabbati in locu^ secretum ceciderat -- in quo
per Sabbatum relictus, cibo sustentatus est: -- Episcopus istius loci severe
Iudaeis edixit, ne illum die Dominico Christianis solenniter sestiuo indidem
extraherent, quare ibi per biduum manner oportuit. Ibid. cap. 11.
Jew, who fell into a loathsome place, and in reverence unto their Sabbath,
would not remove from thence as that day: which when a Bishop of Saxony
understood, he commanded that he should be kept there also the next day
following, for the honor sake of the Sabbath of the Christians.

10 If any desire to know their traditionall law of malice, their Rabbis

Romanists will say, they must symbolize with the Jews in their opinions of
Traditions, then may their doctrine be as easily refuted, as it can be recited:
but if contrary-wise they hold it unmeet to insist upon the opinion of the
Jews, then is this their dispute from Jewish Tradition but hungry and lanke.

CHAP. IX. Of the the Merit of good works.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
7 Seventhly, concerning the force or merit of Alms, and other good works,
proceeding from true faith in the Messiah, the doctrine of the ancient Jews is
diliuered in the book of Tobie, where it is said: Toby 12. 9. after the
translation of the English Bible of 1576. and according to the Greek copy
published by the divines of Basil 1550. the which I do more precisely note, for
that M. Fulke against the Rhemish Testament. fol. 109. a. circa med. denies
the latter part of this text to be in the Greek.
Alms does deliver from death, and does purge all sin: and again, Toby 4.
10.
Alms does deliver from death, and suffers not (the soul) to go into
darkness: and in the foresaid book of Ecclesiasticus, Ecclesiasticus 3. 33.
Water quenches burning fire, and alms expiateth (or purges) sin. And this
is but agreeable with the other Scriptures acknowledged for Canonical, as
where it is said, Daniel 4. 24. Whereas our adversaries do here in stead of
redeem, translate, break off: Hemingius in his exposition of the 84. Psalm.
Englished, page 527. thinks that the Hebrew word signifies to redeem: so
also most clearly in the Greek translation does the Greek word, and so
likewise does the vulgar interpreter, and the ancient Fathers read
accordingly, insomuch as the same reading is observed likewise by Luther in
loc, commun. class. 1. page 72. ante medium: and by Peter Martyr in his Common
places in English, part 3. cap. 4. page 114. b. circa med. by Mecancthon in
loc. co^mun. edit. 1536. cap. de bonis operibus, page 157. in fine* by the
Apology of the confession of Augusta, fol 104. a. circa med. And by the
Tigurine translation of 1544. whereunto may be added the like reading and
judgment of Calvin, Aretius, Bullenger, and many other Protestants.
Redeem thy sins with alms, and thy iniquities with mercy to the poor:
Proverb. 16. 6.
By mercy and truth sin shall be forgiven: Proverb. 15. 27. although this be
omitted in the English Bible of 1576. yet is it so evidently parcel of the
text, that (to omit the Fathers) the Divines of Basil in their edition hereof
in the Greek and Latin, printed 1550. do read it accordingly.
By alms and faith sins are purged: Luc. 11. 41.
Give alms, and behold all things are clean to you.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Satisfying for the sense of Scriptures.
SECT. 1.
THey have produced many Scriptures, but as though the place of Daniel were a
promontorie among the rest, here they pitch a marginal note upon the word
[Redime, that is, Redeem,] taxing the Protestants translation, which is
[Abrumpe, that is, Break off] thy sins, etc. Not but that the Amandus Polanus a
Protestant upon the place of Daniel. See M. Calvin upon Dan. 4. and Peter
Martyr in his Common places.
original is, Break off, of the same root whence Exo. 32. ver. 2. the
Israelites are willed to Break off their earings: but they only conte^d to
show, that many Protestants do acknowledge also their vulgar reading of
Redeem, and for confirmation hereof, have cited Luther and eight other
witnesses to appear. Which only shows that those Protestants would be (as
we may so say) rather Reals then Nominals, not so much laboring upon the word,
as upon the sense of Scripture, which in both translations is the same. For as
the Scripture phrase of redeeming the time is a breaking off the line of former
sins, and a beginning to spinne a new thread of godliness unto the end of
our life: so may it be understood here, where Nabuchadonozer an oppressor of
his subjects by iniust spoil of other men's goods, now in justice (for so the
word in the original is Pintus upon Dan. 4.
confessed to signify) he is to make satisfaction unto man, before he can
expect the favor of God.

2 Their Romish translators in their Annotations upon the text of Luc. 11. do
muster all the objected Scriptures, with no small ostentation, saying, Rhemists
annot. upon Luc. 11 41. citing these Scriptures, Eccl. 3. 33. Dan. 4. 24. Tob.
4. 12. 11. 9. Matthew. 25. 35. 42.
The great force of Alms in diverse places of holy Scripture is signified; in
one place they extingish sin, in another they redeem sins, in another they
deliver from death: and in this place they make clean and satisfy for the
Jews former offenses. Now how will Protestants (say they) like this doctrine
so evidently set forth in Scripture, let the indifferent Reader judge, and how
well it agrees with their only faith? We will show how Protestants may like
it, and so refer the case unto the judgment of the Reader.

3 First in these places which have been objected, there is only mention made
of Alms: can the Romanists say, that Alms alone have this force of redeeming
of sin? If they should, then might they be readily confuted by their own
Jesuit Maldonate, showing from S. Augustine, that Quid enim? an si eleemosynam
dedissent; in ipsum vero qui salutis vnicus author est, non credidissent,
mundi, id est, iusti fuissent? quis hoc dicat? Tractauit hunc locum copiose
Augustine. lib. 1. de verbis Dom. secundum Luca^ and sermon. 30. and in Enchiridio
dicit; qui sceleratissime viuunt, -- and eleemosynas frequentant, frustra sibi
in co blandiri, quoniam Christus dixit, Date eleemosynam. -- Idem Augustinus,
sicut Beda and Strabus eleemosynam pro omni specie misericordiae and charitatis
exponunt, cuius prima pars est vt nostri misereamur, iuxta illud Eccles. 30.
24. Miserere animae t^ae placen^ Deo: quod facimus cum credimus, cumque eaetera
facimus, quae praecipiuntur nobis a Deo -- Paulo post:
no man will say, that giving of Alms can avail for purgation of sin
without faith in him, (Christ) who is the only author of salvation: and this
doctrine the Protestants (they know) do not dislike.

4 Secondly the question is, how then can Alms be said to purge sin?
Whereunto their foresaid Jesuit answers, that Sed adhuc qu^stio est, quomodo
eleemosyna animam mundet, quod facere profecto non potest, nisi omnia peccata
remittat: recte Beda and Bonauentura hoc loco dicunt eleemosynam peccata
remittere, quia ad remissionem peccatorum disponit. Maldon. Ies. com. in Luc
1^. 41. he adds, that Protestants cannot abide this exposition, and then
infers the texts above cited and objected. But this exposition is that which
we may easily admit in his true sense: for God disposes man unto faith and
charity, and then is man disposed and qualified to receive remission.
it is impossible for Alms to cleanse the soul from sin, but to dispose it.

5 Thirdly, their Bishop Omnino hoc Domini consilium simile est illi Danielis,
Redime, etc. -- Non voluit Dominu^ solam eleemosynam sufficere ex iniustis
bonis partam, -- praesupponit eam debere debite fieri and ^i reliqua necessaria
esse coniungenda --: quemadmodum cum dicit, Si remiseritis peccata alijs
dimittet and vobis Deus peccata vestra. -- Basilius ait, -- hoc inquam modo
peccata purgantur, non ipso per seipsum sufficient ad purgation^, verum agente
primordialiter miscricordia Dei, and sanguine Christi, in quo etiam aliorum
omnium habemus redemptionem, si ob singula dignos fecerimus paenitentiae
fructus. Haec Basilius quaest. 271. Iansenius concord. cap. 84. in eum locum
Luc^ 11.
Iansenius and Cardinal -- Addit Basilius, peccata per auaritiam contracta
mundari per largam eleemosynarum largitionem, non quidem principaliter, sed vt
per fructus dignos poenitentia: causam enim principalem purgationis esse
gratiam Dei, and sanguinem Jesus Christi. Card. Bellar. lib. 3. de bonis
operibus, cap. 3.. Tertia expositio.
Bellarmine examining the same text, report the excellent judgment of Basil,
who taught that Alms cannot of themselves expiate sin; but the primordiall
cause is the mercy of God, whereby men have redemption in all other actions;
the which virtue of Christ's merit is only apprehended by faith. And in this
sense the Protestants will like better of phrases of Scripture then can their
Adversaries: for if even the best actions of Christians have need of a
redemption by the virtue of the blood of Christ, then not Alms but Christ's
satisfaction only is of it self of a purgatory and meritorious virtue.
Secondly we add

A demonstration of the impotencie of the Romish Apologists, who, contrary to
their first pretense, do defend this article of Merit, without the testimony
of any Jewish Rabbin, and object Scripture void of all mention of Merit.
SECT. 2.
6 Their title of this part was, Apolog. See above in^tio Sect. cap. 1.
a Demonstration thereof (that is, of the Romish faith) from the testimonies of
ancient Jews, whom they divide into Rabbis before Christ, and Rabbis after
Christ: yet now for proof of Merit only insist in Scriptures, not only of
the old, but also of the new Testament, and do not produce one Rabbin to plead
their cause: so unsuitable have their proofs been unto their preface. Which we
note not as thinking that they were destitute of Jewish patrons herein; for we
know, that all the Rabbis of the sect of the Pharisees would have willingly
subscribed unto this defense, who did not only Pharisaei, neglecta an^mi
munditie, in lauandis mundandi^que corporibus omnem religionem and sanctitatem
ponebant. Maldonat. Ies. c^m. in Luc. 11. 48.
place justice (as their Jesuit Maldonate confesses) in outward washings, but
also in other works, as appears by the parable of the Pharisee and the
Publican: the Pharisee in presumption of his merit gloried in his Alms and
Fasts; the Publicane appealed unto Gods mercies seat, yet went home justified
rather then the other.

7 Now who they be that have more affinity with Pharisaisme, let the Reader
Judge. As for the later Jews, no Christian (we hope) can believe them; for
they are so stupid as to think, that In festo noui anni -- post cibum, vi^,
vxor, liberi, tam senes quam iuuenes ad aquam, sieve pontem quendam consluunt,
peccata ipsoru^ in aquam coniecturi, quemadmodum scriptum est [Et proijciet in
profund^ maris om nia peccata nostra, Mich. 7. 19.] Pisces conspicari omen tam
bonum esse opina^tur, vt prae gaudio in altum salientes, vestes ipsorum quam
valide pos^unt excutiant, se peccata ipsorum super pisces hoc modo excussisse
somniantes. Buxdorfius Synag. Iuda^^. cap. 19.
with only shaking of their clothes over a river, they can shake their sins
upon the fishes, and so return home perfect and clean.

8 Again, the article now in question is propounded by the Apologists to be
concerning the force or merit of Alms, and we see many texts produced to prove
a force of Alms, but not one wherein there is any mention of Merit: which we
might think was done upon an exigence, but that their Rhemists translating
according unto the vulgar Latin, that place of Heb. 13. 16. will have it read
thus: Beneficence and communication do not forget, for with such hosts God is
promerited. Whereunto their Lindanus has pointed with his marginall finger,
saying, Meriti vox in Scripturis tribuitur bonis operibus. Lindanus Panopl.
lib. 3. cap. 20. in margin.
Behold the word Merit in Scriptures: notwithstanding the greek word (which is
the original) properly signifies (as Bellarmine witnesses) Verbum Graecum
significat proprie, Delectatur Deus: aut, vt Erasmus vertit, Placet Deo.
Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei* cap. 14.. Decimus.
God is delighted; or as Erasmus does render it, God is well pleased: which S.
Talibus enim hostijs placatur Deus. August. lib. 10. de ciuitate Dei, cap. 5.
Augustine uses, and, as their Viues acknowledges, is In antiquis [Placetur
Deo:] vtrumque melius quam quod modo vulgo habemus, Promeretur Deus. Viues in
hunc locum Augustini.
better then the Latin vulgar word of promerited. Now God, we know, is pleased
with his own works; he reuiewed them, and Genesis 1.
behold all good: and our good works which are improperly called merita, are
always acknowledged (by S. Augustine) to be Dei munera. See furthermore

Another demonstration of our Adversaries defect in judgment: by discovering
the blindness of their distinction of Merit de congruo, and de condigno, upon
which their objections from Scriptures do depend: confuted by the judgment of
our learned Adversaries.
SECT 3.
9 Our question is concerning Merit, whereof our adversaries do thus
distinguish: Meritum est actio libera acceptata ad aliquod praemiu^. -- quale
duplex communiter ponitur a Theologis; alterum de Condigno -- cui de iustitia
ex lege and condignitate opetis debetur aliquod praemium. Alterum de Congruo --
appellatur opus quod ex gratia and congruitate quadam acceptatur ad aliquod
praemiu^, quod neque ex condignitate operis sibi debeba* Vega Ies. opus^. de
fide and Operibus, quaest. 4. page 781.
There is a Merit of condignitie, whereunto a reward is due from God in
justice, even for the worthiness of the work; the other is called a Merit of
congruitie, whereunto a reward is due though not in justice, yet by grace and
acceptance. We have thoroughly discussed the former member of Merit de condigno:
now are we to examine the second, which is de congruo.

10 This requires an exact trial, that we may know wherein they will allow of
this merit, whether in men as they are in their pure naturals, and destitute of
all gifts of grace: hereof our Vbicunque Augustinus dimicat cum Pelagianis
dicentibus, gratiam Dei dari propter eorum merita, hanc potissimum in eos,

Stapleto^ notes some Romanist, who at the beginning of Luther his opposition
defended this doctrine, and their Sane etsi ego non eis aut faueo, aut vllo

diuini, ad quam non possunt vires naturales. Ibidem, page 300.. Tota igitur.
Benius observes others among the^, who at this day are of the same opinion,
but he learnedly confuteth the^, as being therein enemies unto grace. And the
Apologists and Rhemists stand not altogether upright, who have objected for
proof of merit, two examples of that kind, one of Nabuchodonosor a Pagane
fettered in his sin, whom therefore the Prophet admonishes to break off his
sin of oppression by ^ontrarie acts of justice: from whom they would prove,
that he had power meritoriously to redeem his sins by alms. The second is
from the Pharisees, who (as may appear by Christ's often denunciations of woe
against them) were far wo-begon and destitute of grace: who notwithstanding
(as the Apologists suppose) were able by alms meritoriously to make them
selves clean.

11 But lest they may think that we deal too violently with them, especially
in this first respect of that merit in the state of men wholly forlorn of
grace: we enter upon the second consideration of their merit de congruo, as it
is expressed by their Jesuit Pererius: Patres Conc. Trid. intelligendi sunt de
Merito proprie dicto, quod est de condigno: Nam si loquamur de Merito ample
sumpto, and vt nunc appellatur Meritum de Congruo, non videtur esse negandum
per fidem and alia opera praeparatoria promereri aliquo modo iustificationis
gratiam, hoc enim frequenter repetire licet apud Patres, dicere solitos,
peccatorem per lachrymas -- eleemosynas, caeteraque opera misericordiae
promereri veniam and remiss. peccatorum. Pererius Ies. in Romans cap 3. disp. 17.
number 85.
If we speak (says he) of the merit of congruitie, it may seem to be a
matter not to be denied, that a man by the act of faith, alms, and tears, and
other such like works of preparation, does merit and deserve the grace of
remission of sin. Which (says Cardinal Si de secundogenere operum loquatur
(Kemnitius) -- vix enim est vllus inter veteres, qui non agnoscat meritum
aliquod in operibus poenitentiae, quae per Dei gratiam fiunt. Bellar. lib. 1.

himself defends, being guarded (as he pretends) with the consent of the

Roffensis, and other Schoolmen, together with their Jesuit Suarez; and we may
adioyne the Rhemists and Apologists, who have contended to prove merit of
remission and purgation of sin by alms and other preparatiue works of
conversion and repentance: albeit the opinion of this kind of merit of
congruitie be so untrue, that Cardinal Theologi Scholastici nonnulli volunt
actum poenitentiae: vt etiam actum fidei and dilectionis, esse dispositionem ad

Benius, against their Jesuit Suarez and others, does professedly confute, as
being contrary not only unto Scriptures, but also unto the Canon of the
Council of Conc. Trid. cap. 8. Gratis iustificari ideo dicimur, quia nihil
eorum, quae iustificationem praecedunt, sieve fides, sieve opera, ipsam
iustificationis gratiam promeretur. Benius quo iam iam supra.
Trent, wherein it was determined, that no act which goes before justification,
whether it be faith or works, does merit justification. And finally their
Jesuit Valentia diuing into the bottom of this mystery, does profoundly
judge it Nec probamus sententiam eorum, qu^ tametsi -- ex congruitate dicunt
nos primam gratiam promereri per actus illos, quibus nos vltimo ad illam
dispominus. Non est ita. -- Cum igitur dispositiones vltimae sint in re ab ipsa
gratia habituals, -- neque proprie compensentur per illam, sed tantum gratia
tum detur cum simul eae actiones ab ipsa gratia and libero arbitrio effluunt,
sequitur hominem neque ex iustitia, neque ex congruitate gratiam proprie per
illas promereri. Illud profecto long probabilius diceretur, pet opera bona
moralia, quibus aliquis ante acceptam gratiam faceret quod moraliter posset,
eatenus primam gratiam ex congruo illum met^ri (which a little before he calls
Pelagij errotem) quatenus conueniens and congruum est, vt cum talis facit,
quantum in illo statu moraliter potest, Deus etiam praestet id quod suarum est
partium, hoc est, ei homini auxilia actualia augeat, quibus adiutus possit
facilius gratiam consequi, atque adeo consequatur si sibi non desit. Gregorius
de Valent. Ies. lib. de great. divine. part 4. cap. vlt. paulo ante finem.
far more probable that moral works done before grace shall merit grace de
congruo, then that the last dispositions (as namely contrition, fear, love, or
faith of the repentant) should have the same meritorious power for remission of
sins.

12 Wherefore we close up all the sentence of their judicious Idcirco fides
crit tantummodo quaedam dispositio -- quae nihil prohibet meritum ad
iustificationem interuenite nullum, hoc est, nec de condigno, nec de congruo,
ac proinde nos iustificari penitus gratis. -- Dispositiones interuenite

detestationem, and nouae vitae propositum. -- Quae non impediunt quo minus
impius gratis omnino iustificetur. Benius quo supra, page 315, and 316. Quia

Benius, professing that there go before justification the dispositions of
fear and unformed hope, faith, and love, detestation of sin, and purpose of
amendment of life; but yet so, that without any merit the convert is justified
freely by grace.

Nothing now remains but only a conclusion, by way of Appeal.
SECT. 4.
13 Thus have we answered unto the objected Scriptures, which by the confession
of our Adversaries argue, that. 1.
alms, prayers, tears, hope, faith, love, done by a penitent soul, are
necessary dispositions (but. 1.
not merits) in any man for obtaining remission and purgation of sins:
because they are so far from redeeming or purging men's sins by their own
force, that by reason of their corruptions they themselves have need of
purgation in Christ's blood. We have heard the Apologists promising to give a
demonstration of the particulars of their faith from the testimonies of the
Jewish Rabbis, and yet herein do object. 2.
none.

14 But that which demonstrateth the nullitie of their demonstration, is the
rottenness of the foundation of this their merit, viz. their. 3.
distinction of merit de congruo, and de condigno, that is, of congruitie, and
condignitie; as though it were possible for any to conceive of a merit or
desert, without all respect of condignitie and worthiness unto that reward
which it shall deserve. Therefore have we called it a blind distinction, and
the rather, because (contrary unto Cardinal Bellarmine, and their I^suite
Pererius his peremptory conceit of merit of congruity) many Doctors (who were
in the Romish School, in the judgment of our Adversaries, most godly and
learned) have rejected this kind of merit, as being a new figment, contrary
unto the meaning of ancient Fathers, and the truth of Scriptures, and in the
judgment of their Jesuit de Valentia (for ought that we can collect from his
testimony,) a doctrine less probable then that which both Protestants and
Romanists call Pelagianisme.

15 Ade but hereunto our general confutation of merit (taken from the
testimonies of the greatest Romish adversaries, which Protestants had in their
times:) the sum whereof is, that See above lib. 2. cap. 11. Sect. 8. lit. d.
That Divine does more accord with the judgment of antiquity, and truth of
Scriptures, who absolutely denies all merit, and wholly acknowledges, in all
good, the grace and favor of God.

CHAP. X. Of vows of Monastical and single life.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
8 Eighthly concerning Monastical life, that it was not altogether wanting, but
in some sort professed among the ancient Jews, Josephus testifies saying
Josephus antiquitatum Iudaicarum, l. 18. cap. 2.
The righteousness of the Essees is marvelous etc. they enjoy their riches in
common etc. and in this course above 4. thousand men do live, having neither
wives nor servants, etc. And else where it is affirmed of them, that Josephus
de bello Iudaico l. 2. c. 7.
they are Jews by nation, and do observe continency, avoid Marriage, are
contemners of riches (and) enjoy things in common, none being richer then
other: And that before any be admitted amongst them, Ibidem.
trial is had of his continency, and his other manners are for two years
proved, and then he is taken into the company.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THe same article of Monastical life, other Coccius in his Thesaurus tom 2
lib. 4. and Card. Bellarm lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 5.
Romanists seek to confirm by the same examples of the same Essaei: who
approach to be examined, when, and what they were. If we require their age, the
Apologists have answered, that they were ancient Jews: but how ancient? Some,
from Pliny, judged them to have been Verum quod pertinet ad horum
antiquitatem, dum dicunt eosper multa seculorum millia extitisse,
most ancient, even of many thousand years before Christ: whom Cardinal Certe
non e^. qua sunt dicta, facilitate probantur; nam nec ij qui res Iudaicas sunt
protecuti tam antiquam originem Essaeis tribuunt. Existimamus enim Plinium,
quia nouisset genus Iudae orum vetustissimum, existimasse Essaenorum quoque
Iudaeorum sectam illis fuisse congenitam. Potius autem standum esse Gentilibus
scriptoribus de rebus Iudaicis, quam proprijs, nemo dixerit: -- Si enim tam
nobile and prope diuinum viuendi genus ahte tot secula vigebat, quae ratio est
quod nec in veteri instrumento, nec in nouo vlla de eo habita est mentio? (...)
and Josephus de horum instituto (namely before Christ) tacuit, -- and Ethnici
senptores qui ante Christum vixerunt, etc. Cardin. Baronius anno 64. number. 6.
and 8.
Baronius confuteth, proving both by divine and humane stories, that they can
hardly be proved to have been before the coming of Christ; and the greatest
antiquity he yields unto them, is the time of Verum nec in his contentiosum
funem trahimus, vt negemus ante Christum fuisse Essaenos: demus nihilominus
Iosepho sieve alijs, vt Essaenos dicamus fuisse Iudaeis, eosdemque etiam ante
Christum Herodis maioris tempore claruisse (nulla enim antiquior apud Iosephum
de eis habetur memoria) ac ijsdem, quos ait, vitae institutionibus claruisse;
quis prohibet dicere, eosdem praedicatione Apostolorum conuer^os fuisse, etc?
Baronius ibidem, number. 9.
King Herod the great, under whose reign our Lord Jesus was borne, the King of
Kings. So that these Essaei were indeed but Nouelists in respect of ancient
Jews: but because many erroneous sects were more ancient, we stand not so much
upon their time, as upon their truth, if it can be shown.

2 Cardinal Bellarmine professes, that Multa tribuuntur Essaenis a Iosepho,
quae manifest erronea, and superstitiosa sunt, quorum nihil tribuit Philo suis
Therapeutis. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 5.. Respondeo duas.
many things are attributed by Josephus unto these Essaei, which are manifestly
erroneous and superstitious. The Bishop Stratonicus Cumarum Episcopus, in
Collectaneis suis autumat hasce Traditiones fuisse (speaking of such as Christ
condemned) Placita and Decreta Iudaicarum sectarum: quatuor enim, vt Josephus
and Epiphanius scribunt, apud Iudaeos fuerunt viuendi instituta, quorum vnum
profitebantur Pharisaei, alterum Galilaei, tertium Sadducaei, quartum Essaeni.
Sixtus Senensis Biblioth. lib. 2. Tit. Traditiones, page 123.
Stratonicus collecteth, that these Essaei were addicted unto some of those
Traditions, which were condemned by Christ under the name of Traditions of men:
for at the time of our Saviors preaching, the Jews (as he proves out of
Josephus and Epiphanius) were divided into sour sects, viz. Pharisees,
Galilaeans, Sadduces, and Essaeans. And as the Pharisaei, (de quibus sic
Epiphanius) virginitati studebant, etc. -- sic dicebantur, eo quod separati
essent ab alijs propter spontaneam and superstuam religionem apud ipsos
receptam: Phares enim Hebraica lingua separationem significat. Carol. Sigonius
lib. 5. de Repub. Heb. cap. 11. page 476.
Pharisees, who affected virginity, were called Pharisaei of Phares, that is,
separation, because they separated themselves from others, taking upon them a
proper and superstuous profession: so of the Essaei their Carolus Sigonius
gives testimony out of Philo and Josephus, that Sed multo preclarius Philo in
lib. qui in^cribitur, Omnes probos esse liberos: In Syria and Palestina, quae
parts Iudae^rum sunt, non modicae, dicuntur quidem nomine Essaei, -- quasi
(...), id est, sa^cti vocan. quon. a^^ Dei cul^o^es praec p^esunt (...) quo

those four thousand Essaei were so called from the Greek word (...), that
is, Saints, or holy men, because they were principal worshippers: and were so
conceited of their own sanctity, that i De his losephus lib. Antiq. 18. ita,
Sacrificia cum populo non celebr^nt, quod ^^ potant (...) a and ^anctitate
illis praestare. Sigonius ibid.
they would not offer sacrifice with the people, because they thought them not
so hallowed as themselves: whom for the same cause Sigonius calls Oessem --
Iudaei quidem genete, moribus hypocritae, mentis industria versuti. Sig. nius
ibid. page 277.
hypocrites.

3 By this which has been confessed, the sophistry and indiscretion of our
Adversaries is become more then visible, seeing that for the defense of
monastical life, which they pretend to be a state of rare holiness and
perfection, they have chosen for their example hereof the Essaei, who were by
manners hypocrites, by their Ord^r, or rather disorder sectarists, in
prof^ssion erroneus, and for their devised Traditions, condemned by Christ.
These ar^ they in whom, as in the grand patrons and patterns of Romish
votarists the Apologists do yet more inconsiderately insist.

SECT. 2.
4 Doctor Raynolds said, that In his Conference, page 488.
Philo writes not of Christian Monks, but of Jewish Essees: and we know that
he would not speak without book; which we are induced rather to believe,
because the Romanists are in controversy among themselves, whether Josephus
and Philo do both write of the same Essaei: some say, that they both described
Alij docenttam Philonem quam Iosephu^ de Christianis loqui: quibus fauere
videtur B. Hieronymus, quam sententia^ tuetur Galenus. Bellarm. lib. 2. de
Monach. cap. 5.. Alij docent.
Christian Essaei; some Quidam asserunt non loqui de ijsdem Iosephum, and
Philonem, nam Josephus, lib. 18. Antiq. cap. 2. asserit Essaenorum sectam
antiquam apud Iudaeos fuisse. Bellarmin. ibidem, paulo ante.
deny it, because Josephus says, that the first of these Essaei was ancient
among the Jews. So that they who think that Philo did describe the same
Essaei, must necessarily hold them to have been Jewish.

5 Secondly, Cardinal Arbitror Philonem ipsum secundum Eusebij, Epiphanij,
Hieronymi, and aliorum sententiam, non nisi de Christianis esse locutum, it a

and quae essent Iudaeorum Christianorum, Iudaeis prorsus adscribere cupienti.
Card. Baronius anno 64. number. 11. col. 817.
Baronius cannot deny but that it was the intent of Philo in his description
of the Essaei, to commend the orders which were then used among the Jews: how
then should not D. Reynolds and the Centurists, following only Philo, judge
the objected Essaeans to have been fully Jewish? Finally the Essaei spoken of
by the Fathers, might possibly have been some of that order, who had been
converted unto Christianity, and in the time of persecution continued their
sequestration in the deserts, as well as others, whom their Hoc tempore multi
Eremum colebant metu persecutionum. Genebrard. anno 139. page 381.
Genebrard notes to have taken that course. In which sense the Apologists
objection, taken from the faith of ancient Jews (as they feine,) is no way
Jewish, but Christian, and consequently impertinent.

CHAP. XI. Of Vows in general.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
9 Ninthly, concerning Vows, it is said in the writings of the old Testament:
Psalm. 76. 11.
Vow ye, and render your vows unto God: (2) Whosoever voweth a vow unto the
Lord, etc. he shall not break his promise, but shall do according to all which
proceeds (3) Number. 30. 3.
from his mouth. Deuteronomy. 23. 21.
When thou shall vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shall not be slack to pay it,
for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee. Ecclesiastes 5. 3.
When thou have vowed a vow unto God, defer not to pay it: etc. It is better
that thou should not vow, then that thou should vow and not pay it.
Whereunto might be added sundry other Psalm. 22. 25. and Psalm. 50. 14. and Esaias
19. 21.
like testimonies from the writings of the old Testament.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
AND can no Protestant answer this objection?

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
We are not ignorant how that Peter Martyr, M. D. Fulke, and others seek to
euade in answering thereto, that Peter Martyr de caelibatu and votis, page 302
fine, and 303. and ibid. page 304. post med. He further says: Votum ego
caeremoniale antiquae legis praeceptum fuisse affirm^. And M. Fulke answering
to Psalm. 76. 11. says, That text pertains to the old Testament, in his
Retentiue against Bristowes Motives, etc. page 153. fine. And Bullinger in his
Decades in English, page 380. ante med. says, Vows belong to the Jewish
ceremonies.
Vows were ceremonies of the old Testament, etc. abolished by Christ's coming.
But is not the contrary many ways evident? as 1. First in that vows were
made before Moses time, as is to be seen in the example of Genesis 28. 20. Then
Jacob vowed a vow, saying, etc.
Jacobs vow.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THe tenor of the text is this: [If God shall be with me, and keep me in this
journey, etc. then shall the Lord be my God, and this stone shall be Gods
house.] Genesis 28. 20. In the which case our question is not about the matter of
this vow, which Cardinal Bellarmine and their Jesuit Pererius say, was Genesis
28. Votum vouit Jacob; Si fuerit Dominus mecum, etc. tunc e^t mihi Dominus,
etc.] Quod sit votum de re non praecepta, patet, quia alioqui peccasset Jacob
faciendo votum conditionatum de re praecepta. Bellar. lib. 2. de Monach. cap.
16.. Septimo votum, and. Nono probatur. Stolidun^ fuisset sub ea condition

in Genesis 28.
a matter not commanded by God, but in it self indifferent; because it were
folly and iniquity to condition with God about that which he has commanded to
be done: but their Jesuit Azorius proves from the same text, that man may
bind himself to God, for performance of that which God has bound him to
discharge. As when in matrimony one promises chastity, which afterward he
does violate, Nihil impedit quo minus quis se denuo voti religione obstringat,
ad quod alioqui faciendum lege and praecepto compellitur. -- Deus enim nos sibi
suis legibus deuinxit, and nos ipsos ei pariter voti nexu vinculoque obligamus;
vt Jacob Genesis 28. vouit Domino, se eum vt Deum veneraturum: vnde qui castitatem
Deo promissam adulterio violat, est and diuinae legis violatae, and voti facti
reus. Azor. Ies. Instit. Moral. part 1. lib. 11. cap. 13.. Caeterum.
he thereby becomes guilty both of the breach of his own vow, and of the
transgression of Gods law. Of this kind is the vow of every man in baptism,
to forsake the Devil; which vow no Christian will contemn. We come to the use.

3 Master Calvin defends, that Votorum finis and vsus est primo, vt

gratiarum actionem inclinent^nam cert^ vouendi libertas filijs Dei pro
subleuanda eorum infirmitate conced^tur, -- mod^ in hunc, quem dicimus finem

the liberty of vowing is not abolished by the Gospel, if vows be undertaken
to a right end. M. Luther, and M. Calvin (as Cardinal Bellarmine witnesses)
Lutheri and Caluini sententia eadem esse videtur, vterque enim tria quaedam de
votis docet, 1. ad colendum Deum non nisi de rebus praeceptis fieri: -- ad

Bellar. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 15.
consent both in one opinion, to think that vows which belong to Gods worship,
must be in things which are commanded by God: and vows which make for our
better auoidance of sin, may be used in things which are not commanded. M.
Fulke did indeed deny Ananias to have vowed, yet did he aknowledge the
lawfulness of Against Bristowes Motives, page 153.
vows as well as any Protestant, notwithstanding he censureth the arguments
used by Romanists for proof of their monkerie, to be but ill-fauouredly
patched together; because they are superstitious for want of Gods commandment,
blasphemous for the opinion of merit, impossible for the frailty of man's
nature. The only difference in the objected Authors is in the diverse
exposition of some Scriptures.

4 The first place is from the example of Ananias and others, who in the Act. 2
45. 4. 32.
Acts sold their possessions, and laid them at the Apostles feet, with whom
all things were made common. Albeit their Jesuit Lorinus doubts not to
affirm, that all those Christians did profess also Caelibem agebant vitam
quotquot per votum s^^e omnium rerum possessione abdic^bant: etsi p^^u^ iuncti
mat^i^onio erant, ex consensu continebant. Lorinus Ies com. in Act. 4. ver. 32.
continency, yet their cardinal Act. 2. Vendebant possessiones, etc.] Aduerte
quod nulla fit mentio de voto paupe^tatis, sed tantummodo quod erant illis
omnia communia. Caret. com. in Act. 2. -- [Nonne venundatus in tua erat
potestate? Act. 5.] Hinc clare apparet, quod non voti necessitate Christiani
omnes omnia tunc habebant communia, sed libera perfectione charitatis. Idem
com. in Act. cap. 5.
Caietan does give us to understand from the same Scripture (as being a matter
apparent,) that then all Christians had all things common, not by necessity of
vows, but by free perfection of charity, supplying unto every one according
as every man had need.

5 But that we may grant those Christians by vow to have relinquished the
property and dominion which they had in those possessions, and to have yielded
them (as they did) unto the common use of the Saints; yet was the occasion
hereof extraordinary, and proper for that time, whilst Act. 2. 45.]
Possessiones and substantias vendebant, and diuidebant illa omnibus, prout
cuique opus erat.] Singularis Dei prouidentia fuit, vt propter mox futuram
persecutionem dispergendis suppeteret, vtcunque ex distractis possessionibus
and substantijs vnde viuerent, atque fa^il^us ipsarum personarum damnum ferrent
iam abstracti ab externis bonis. Lorinus Ies. com. in Act. cap. 2. verse. 45.
by the singular providence of God, (as faith their Jesuit Lorinus)
foreseeing the persecution of Christians now at hand, they thus prepared for
the relief of the Saints. And we know that to conclude a perpetual doctrine
from a practice extraordinary, can be no better then not only (as our learned
Doctor has called it it) a patched, but also a prejudicial consequence. For
these forenamed Christians sold their possessions, and brought the price of
them into the public communion: but the Monastical Orders, and the whole
Ecclesiastical maintenance arises from a paying of some price of money, and
purchase of possessions: insomuch that (as their Jesuit confesses) the
difference of the after-Church from the Apostolic of that time, is no less
then between Quod futuram Ecclesiam in Gentibus praeuidebant Apostoli, idcirco
praedia in Iudaea minime sunt adepti, sed pretia tantuminodo. -- At vero cum
succresceret Ecclesia -- praedia habere ipsi licuit. In Decreto ex Miltiade
Papa. Lorinus ibid.
pretia and praedia, that is, price and possession.

6 The next place of Scripture, wherein we acknowledge widows votarists, as it
does make for the confessed lawfulness of vows, so does it absolve the bond
of that absolute necessity, which our Adversaries have fastened upon their
Romish vows, as has been See above lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.
and lib. 2. cap. 1. per totum.
proved above; where the manifold defections of the Romish Church from the
anciently free, discreet, and honest condition of vowing, have been
discovered. The further discourse hereof we reserve unto the proper See

Adversaries.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
10 Tenthly, as concerning our Confession of sins, Galatinus de arcanis
Catholicae veritatis, lib. 10. cap. 3.
Petrus Galatinus gives examples of several testimonies In libro Sanhedrin
Hierosolymitano in capite quod Nigmar Haddin, id est, definitum est iudicium,
it is said: Omnis consitens habet partem inseculo futuro. Sic enim in Achan
reperimus quod dixit ei lehosuas: Fili mi, da obse^r^ honorem Domino Deo
Israel, and da confessionem, and indica mihi quaeso quid feceru, necceles a me,
etc. And in libro Ioma, id est dierum, in capite Iom Hakippurim, id est dies
propitiationum, it is said, dixit R. Hurma, Omnis qui transgressione
transgressus est, necesse est vt singulatim exprimat peccatum, etc.
in the ancient Jews.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THe hinge of this question is not (as has been See above lib. 2. cap. 14.
Sect. 1.
confessed) concerning Confession of sins in general unto a Minister, but of
particular sins: neither whether we may, but whether we ought necessarily
purpose a manifestation of every known mortal sin, and the grievous
circumstances thereof; or must otherwise stand hopeless of all remission of
our sins. And now are we sent unto the Jewish School to learn this point of
Romish Confession, and that by the direction of their Galatinus. He will have
us to observe the example of Josh. 7.
Achan, who after he had privily stolen the Anathema and cursed gold, was found
out (God so ordaining) by lot, and commanded by Joshua (who was appointed by
God the Captain over the camp of Israel) to confess his sin, and to give
the glory unto God: whereupon the Jewish Sanhedrin commenting, says: He that
confesses shall have part in the life to come.

2 This is the Base: now mark their descant: they should prove a private and
auricular Confession, but object a public, even before all Israel; they
allege a civil Confession exacted of a Magistrate, that God may be glorified
in the truth of the sentence of death, which had been passed upon the
malefactor, when as they should prove a sacramental Confession to a Priest. So
harsh is this strain which Galatinus, and after him Coccius Thesaur. tom. 1.
lib. 7. Art. 3. in fine.
Coccius, and now their Apologists do play in print.

3 So do they also err upon the next string, which is the sentence of Rabbi
Huma, whom they mis-terme Hurma: He says, that it is necessary for every one
who transgresses, that he do particularly confess his sin. True, but
whether be meant that every man particularly must confess every known sin,
or whether that single Rabbin meant a confession to be made unto man, or unto
God, it does not directly appear* But it is no incongruitie that their author
Galatinus (according to the censure of their own Senensis) See hereafter cap.
14.. 2.
a vain author, should abuse the names of Rabbis for the coloring of a vain
conclusion. It may be the Apologists will be more exact in their next argument.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And like further testimony or prefiguration thereof is not wanting in
Leuiticus; for whereas several sacrifices are there appointed for several
sins, as for Leuit. 4. 2, 3. etc.
sin through ignorance, and other Leuit 5. 1. 4. 17. and 6. 1. 5. and Number. 5.
7.
particular offenses, for which Leuit. 4. 3.
the Priest was appointed to offer and make Leuit. 4. 20. and 5, 6. 13. and 6.
7.
atonement, how could the Priest here offer those sundry Sacrifices appointed
severally according to the diversity of SINS, unless the party so
offending confessed the same sins to him? Which to have been so, is yet
furthermore probable, in that it was there also appointed and said, Leuit. 5.
6. and Number. 5. 7.
When he has sinned in any of these things, then he shall confess that he
has sinned therein etc. and the Priest shall make atonement for him,
concerning his sin.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
4 This strong and long argument of How could the Priest, etc. is answered
easily in few words, viz. the Priest was contented to hear the party confess
in general, that he had sinned through ignorance, albeit what particular point
of ignorance it was he had not unfolded: according to the common confession in
our English Liturgy of negligences and ignorances; amongst which kind of
sins, the Apologists (we think) are bound to reckon this their argument for
proof of their auricular confession; it is so ignorantly objected. For their
own Lyranus, who had been sometime a Jew, feared not to confess, that See
above lib. 2. cap. 24.
the people of the old Testament did not make confession unto the Priest of
their particular sins, when, (as their Cardinal Tolet notes) See ibid.
the purpose of confessing was not necessary. Of the which Romish confession
Erasmus is acknowledged to affirm, that Erasmus Roterodamus in epistola^
Hieronymi ad Oceanum: item ad Act. 19. Apost. and in Method. Theologiae docet,
confessione^ secretam singulorum peccatorum non modo non esse iure diuino
institutam and imperatam, sed neque in vsu antiquae Ecclesiae fuisse. Vt citat
Coccius Thesaur. lib. 7. art. 3. Tit. Improbant. page 809. Tom. 2.
it was not ordained by God, nor yet practiced in the ancient Church after
Christ. Which we have already See above lib. 2. cap. 24.
proved by many confessed observations.

CHAP. XIII. Of Sacrifice.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
11 Eleuenthly, as concerning Melchisedechs offering of bread and wine in
Sacrifice, (which our Adversaries Master Fulk against the Rhemish Testament in
Heb. 7. sect. 8. sol. 406. a. initio, says: Melchisedechs bread and wine
pertained not to his priestly office, neither did he offer it to God. And M.
Willet in his Sinopsis, page 478. ante med. and versus finem, affirms the
like. And M. Whittaker in his answer to M. Rainolds, etc. page 67. says,
Melchisedech did not by any thing wherein he so sacrificed, prefigure the
sacrifice and priesthood of Christ.
deny,) and the prefiguration thereby, of our own Sacrifice of the new
Testament: Rabbi Samuel says: Rabbi Samuel in Bereschit Rabba ad cap. 14. Genesis
Melchisedech set forth the acts of Priesthood, for he sacrificed bread and
wine to the holy and blessed God. Rabbi Phinees says, Rabbi Phinees ibidem in
cap. 28. Numer.
In the time of the Messiah all sacrifices shall cease etc. as it is said,
Psalm. 110. Thou art a Priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.
Rabbi Moses Hadarsan says of Melchisedech, Rabbi Moses Hadarsan in Bereschith
Rabba ad cap. 14. Genesis
Bringing forth bread and wine, shows that he taught the act of Priesthood,
which was to sacrifice bread and wine, and this is that which is read in the
Psalms, etc. Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of
Melchisedech. This point is so evident in the old Jewish Rabbis, that
Theodorus Theodorus Bibliander de Lancta Trinitate, lib. 2. page 89. says,
Erat apud veteres Haebraeos dogma receptissimum, in aduentu Messia benedicti,
cessatura ess^ omnia legalia sacrificia, tantumque celebrandum sacrificium
Thoda, gratiarum actionis, etc. and illud peragendum pane and vim sicut
Melchisedech Rex Salem and sacerdos, etc. panem and vinum protulit.
Bibliander (a Protestant writer) doubts not accordingly to confess the same.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing the notable slight used by the Apologists in
their false allegations of the Jewish Rabbis.
SECT. 1.
TWo things come to be disputed in this objection: the first is the truth of
the sense of Scripture, [Melchizedech brought forth bread and wine, etc.]
whether Melchisedech in the use of that Bread and Wine performed an office of
his Priesthood, or no; the second is the consequence, which our Adversaries
infer thereupon, as namely, a Sacrifice properly propitiatory.

2 Concerning the sense of the story, we are challenged to consult with the
Jewish Rabbis, for my discharge both in this of Sacrifice, and in the next
question of Transubstantiation: unto which I could not find that due
satisfaction from the confession of our Adversaries, which in other questions I
had done. I therefore held it requisite to desire the help of our learned D.
Smith, D. Layfield, M. Bedwell.
Doctors, who are most expert in the knowledge of the Hebrew: unto whom I laid
open the Apologists allegation of Rabbi Samuel in Bereshith Rabba, of Rabbi
Phinees ibid. of Rabbi Moses Hadarsan ibid. They (after they had perused the
Bereshith Rabba) answered, that they found in the places alleged just nothing
to the purpose, as may appear by their own Rabbi Samuel in Bereshith Rabba
upon the 14. of Genesis, has these words: He did reveal unto him the
ordinances of the great Priesthood: meaning Aarons priesthood, as appears by
his interpreting y^ bread to be the shewbread, and the wine to be the drink
offerings. Otherwise, that Melchisedech set forth the acts of priesthood; or
that he sacrificed bread or wine, there is not one word: nothing that can be
extended beyond Aarons priesthood. Rabbi Phinees is not cited in that book on
the 28. of Numbers, nor in the whole Parashah: neither is there any thing to
that purpose. Rabbi Moses Hadarshan in that book on the 14 of Genesis, is not
cited: neither any thing to that purpose. Miles Smith, John Layfield, William
Bedwell.
words, whereunto they have subscribed their names.

3 And to as little purpose is their confirmation taken from the testimony of
our Bibliander: for (not to enquire further then into the words as they are
cited by the Apologists in the marge^t) he says, that The Apologists in the
marge^^, at the letter, f.
it was a most common opinion among the jews to think, that at the coming of
the Messiah all the legal Sacrifices should cease, and that only the
Sacrifice of Thoda, or of thanksgiving, was to be performed in bread and wine:
this sentence does establish the doctrine of Protestants, who acknowledge in
the Eucharist (as Cardinal See above lib. 2. cap. 7. Sect. 5.
Bellarmine confesses) a Sacrifice Eucharisticall or of thanksgiving: rather
then it can countenance the faith of the Romanists, who make Melchisedeks
Sacrifice, wherein there was really both bread and wine, to be a type of their
Sacrifice of the Mass, wherein (as they believe) there is nothing but the
shows and colors of bread or wine: and for this cause have been convinced of
a See above lib. 2 cap. 7. Sect. 2.
double folly. But this is the fate of subtlety to entangle it self in it
own bird-lime.

4 Nevertheless we may corroborate the former judgment of Protestants by

CHAP. XIIII. Of Transubstantiation.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
12 Twelfthly, as concerning their further opinion of the Churches Sacrifice
upon the coming of the Messiah: our now sacrifice is therein so plainly
signified and affirmed by the ancient Jews, who lived before Christ's time,
that (as Galatinus says of one of them,) Galatinus de Areanis Catholicae
veritatis, l. 1. cap. 3. circa med.
they may be thought not so much to have foretold things to come, as to have
reported Euangelist-like things already done. To this end says Rabbi Cahana,
Rabbi Cahana ad cap. 49. Genesis ver. 11.
The Sacrifice which shall be offered of wine, shall not only be changed into
the substance of the blood of the Messiah, but also into the substance of his
body: the Sacrifice which shall be of bread notwithstanding that it be white
as milk, it shall be converted into the substance of the body of the Messiah.
In like manner Rabbi Judas says, R. Judas in 25. Exodus
The bread shall be changed when it shall be sacrificed, from the substance of
bread into the substance of the body of the Messiah, which shall descend from
Heaven, and he himself shall be the sacrifice, etc. Rabbi Simeon says, R.
Symeon filius Iohai libro qui inscribitur reuelatio Secretorum.
The sacrifice which after the Messiah his coming priests shall make, etc. they
shall make it of bread and wine, etc. and that sacrifice which shall be so
celebrated upon every Altar, shall be turned into the body of the Messiah.
Rabbi Barachias teaches, that at the coming of the R. Barachias in
Ecclesiasten.
Messiah, food shall come from heaven like a little cake.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THese testimonies of Rabbi Cahana, Rabbi Judah, Rabbi Symeon, are such (if yet
they were such,) that they make so directly for the Romish article of
Transubstantiation, as though they would condemn not only See above lib. 2.
cap. 2.
Evangelists, and ancient See above lib. 2. cap. 2.
Fathers, but also the most See above lib. 2. cap. 2.
Romish Doctors for the space of almost a thousand years after Christ, of
ignorance or infancy; because these did not in so express terms reveal or
publish this mystery unto the world.

2 Whereby I was moved to think that some new Romish, rather then any old
Jewish Rabbin, had been not a fore-teller, but a forgerer of these sentences:
and in this jealousy did I request a The society of our most learned
Hebricians, assembled for the translation of the Bible.
College of very learned Hebricians to satisfy me concerning the truth of
these testimonies; which, at the first narration thereof seemed unto them to
deserve no more credit then Fables.

3 The three above mentioned Doctors after their painful and industrious
search into the cited places, returned (with the subscription of their own
names,) for Rabbi Cahana in that book on the 49. of Genesis is not cited, nor
has he there any thing to that purpose. Rabbi Judas in that book on the 25.
of Exodus has no such thing, nor in the whole Parashah Terumash.
Rabbi Cahana, and for R. Judas, a non est inuentus, that is, there is not
mentioned, in those alleged places, any thing to that purpose. To See their
margent in the next Section.
Rabbi Simeon they answer, that he writ no book carrying the title of Reuelatio
Secreterum. Of the rest they judge as no better than figments: which we the
rather suspect, because otherwise their greatest Rabbi (if we may so term
their Cardinal Bellarmine) would not have lost so great an advantage, taken
from the witness of so ancient Jews, especially seeing that they are more
plain and pregnant for Transubstantiation, then are the sayings of
Transubstantiators themselves. But this delusion will better appear by the
dotage of their wituesse Galatinus, who is that Author whom they profess to
follow. As for example:

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Thus did these religious and ancient Jews, who lived before CHRIST'S coming,
foretell and write (by special instinct) concerning our Churches blessed
Sacrifice; whereunto might be added sundry of their other no less plain
t^stimonies, Rabbi Ionathas in libro collectionum in Psalm. 72. says, Ille est
Messiah de que lequitur totus Psalmus: cum ergo ait, Et erit placenta frumenti
in terra in capite montium, vult dicere quod placenta panis fiet sacrificium in
capitibus sacerdotum qui sunt in Ecclesia. And Rabbi Moses Hadarsan, in Psalm.
136. says, Gustate and videte quoniam bonus est Deus, quia panis quem dat
omnibus, ipse est caro eius, and dum gustatur panis, conuertitur in carnem, etc.
the which together with these are collected specially by Petrus See these
aforesaid testimonies, and sundry other like alleged from the Rabbis by
Petrus Galatinus de Arcanis Catholicae veritatis, lib. 10. cap. 5, 6, and 7.
Galatinus, and by M. Whitaker For whereas Duraeus urges this collectio^ made
by Galatinus of the Hebrews foresaid so plain sayings concerning Real
Presence and Sacrifice. M. Whittaker answering thereunto, lib. 9. contra
Duraeum, page 818. circa med. neither confesses, nor yet denies, but shufleth
them off, saying only thereto: Tuum in hac causa Petrum Galatinum minime
profecto desideramus, nec Hebraeorum testimonijs illis indigemus. And is this a
direct and sufficient answer to so many plain sayings of the old Hebrews that
lived before Christ, so evidently foreshewing and affirming the Real Presence
and Sacrifice of Christ's blessed body in the holy Sacrament?
rather shufled off then answered,) wherein they do no less plainly foreshew
the truth of Christ's body really present, and offered in the blessed
Sacrament, then did the heathen Sybills in like manner foretell the truth of
his incarnation. And for so much as Esaias 41. 23.
God only knows things to come, the devil not being able to fore^ell things
simply future, but only such other future effects as depend upon their
secondarie causes then already past or present; in which causes, he (of his
great skill and experience) foreseeth the coming of the said effects: to which
kind, the foresaid doctrines of Real Presence and Sacrifice, cannot in any
sort be reduced, by reason they cannot be said to have been then depending upon
any natural or other cause, then past or in being, save only the immediate
and sacred will of God. This therefore so plain foresaid prediction made by the
ancient Rabbis before Christ's time, in behalf of Real presence and
Sacrifice, demo^strating it self so evidently to have procceded not from any
secundary cause, but only from a divine instinct, yields thereby a most
strong argument in behalf of the said doctrines.

This manner of answering, the Apologists call once and again a shuffling.

5 Indeed he might have well enlarged his answer from their own Proinde non

Senensis, who in his Bibliotheca, dedicated unto the Pope, challenged
Galatinus of notable vanity, for affirming that the Jewish Thalmudicall works
ought to be translated into Latin, abusing the authority of Pope Clemens for
his defense: wherein (says their Por^o quod ex male intellecto Clementis V.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
13 Thirteenthly and lastly (to omit other points,) as concerning the final
ending of controversies, not only Scripture, but a certain visible and lively
Judge upon earth was appointed and acknowledged. To omit all other proof
thereof, the law of Duteronomie was, that when there did Deuter. 17. 8. 9. 11.
arise any matter too hard for the (people) in judgment: they were appointed
to go up to the place which God had chosen, and to come to the Leuiticall
Priest, and to the Judge in those days: and to ask of them the sentence of
judgment, and to do according to the judgment which they did tell, not
declining neither to the right hand, nor to the left; it being yet further said
of him that did Deuter. 17. 12.
presumptuously refuse to obey the commandment of the Priest, that by the
decree of the Judge that man should die. Now that the sentence grounded upon
this law, was not subject to new question, under color of appealing to the
Scriptures, but was definitive and final, and concerned as well Ecclesiastical
as Civil causes, is in it self plain, and for such Doctor Rainolds in his
Conference, page 251. ciremed. says, The law of Deuteronomy cronomie was made to
establish a highest Court of Judgment, in which all harder causes
Ecclestasticall and Civil should be determined without appeall further. And M.
Whitaker de sacra Scriptura, p. 466. prope finem, says: Responde^ verba ista
intelligenda esse etc. de authoritate tantum definiendi difficiles lites ac
controuersias, si^^ Ecclesiasticas, illas quidem per ministrum, sieve politicas
and forenses per magistratum, vt esset semper in vtrisque aliquis, a qu^
prouocare non liceat, alioquin enim nullus esset litigandi finis: and vide
ibidem page 470. paulo post med. And M. Bilson in his perpetual government of
Christ's Church, page 20. post med. says hereof, that the same did concern such
matters as were of greatest moment, both civil and sacred, and their sentence
by Gods law no man might refuse without punishment of death. And see the like
assertion in M. Hooker in his preface before his books of Ecclesiastical
Policy, page 26 fine, and 27. and 28. fine.
confessed by M. D. Rainolds, M. D. Whitaker, M. D. Bilson, and M. Hooker.
Whereupon it is evident, that not only Scripture (which they of the old
Testament had as well as we now have) but besides that, a certain visible
Judge was then appointed to determine controversies.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
ANd that we may the better determine this controversy, it will be requisite
to know first, what was the state of the Jewish Church, in respect of
continuance. Hereof we read, that first Christ in the days of his flesh
approved the authority of The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chair, that
which they shall say unto you, that do. Matthew. 23. 2.
Moses chair. Secondly, in his own person before his death, he celebrated the
I have desired to eat ye Passover. Luc. 22. 15.
Passover, which was a principal sacrifice commanded in the Leuiticall law.
Thirdly, at his death the veil of the Temple rent in twain, Ioh. 19:
betokening (as their own Cardinal Iansenius notes,) that Ioh. 19. 30. Velum
templi scissum est.] Significans -- quod carnalis lex cum suis sacrificijs
omnibus iam finem acciperet, iuxta vaticiniu^, Dan. 9. In dimidio hebdomadis
deficiet hostia and sacrificiu^, and erit in templo abhominatio desolationis.
Card. Iansenius concord. in eum locum. Ioh. 19. 30. cap. 143. p. 1046.
now all the Jewish law and sacrifice was at an end, which had continued until
that last consummatum est, which Christ uttered, when the whole Leuiticall
pedagogue first yielded up the ghost, and were not translated (as our Post
Domini passionem translatum est sacerdotium ad Christianos. Ribera Ies. in Hos.

Salmeron Iesuita, tom. 4. part 3. tract. 32.. Est ergo.
Adversaries confess) until the accomplishment of Christ's passion.

2 We understand then, what was the time of the death of that Jewish Synagogue,
and end of their sacrifices, which notwithstanding was not buried until the
full publishing of the Gospel, when the Apostles in a Council at Jerusalem
did, by their decree of liberty from the law of Moses (that we may so speak,)
celebrate her funeral.

3 Now are we to try the sufficiency of the judgment of that Synagogue,
whilst as she lived the only visible Church of God: the judgment thereof, we
say, was not law, but so far as it was according unto the law, as S. Paul
taught in his reprehension of Ananias thus: Acts 23. 3.
Thou sit here to judge according unto the law, and suffer thou me to be
stricken contrary to the law? And the obedience which is due unto that
judgment, must needs be proportionable, that is, it has in it a limited, and
not an absolute necessity of obedience, as appears by the objected place of
Deuteronomy. 17. 11: Thou shall do according to the law which they shall teach.

4 Which doctrine ought to be familiar unto our Adversaries, seeing that their
ordinary Nota, quod non dicitur tibi vt obedias, nisi ^uxta legem docuennt:
vnde Matthew. 23. Sedent super Cathedram Mosis. Glossa ordinaria in hunc locum.
Gloss does directly affirm as much. Otherwise the Israelites might have
sacrificed upon the And Aaron made a golden calfe. Exodus 32. 4. And Aaron made
an altar before it, and proclaimed saying, To morrow shall be an holy day to the
Lord. verse. 5.
altar which Aaron made before the calfe; and have carried idolatrous censers
with the Ez^ch. 8. 10.
seventy ancients; and have worshipped the Sun with the Ibid. verse. 16.
five and twenty, who were near the altar; and have sacrificed upon an
idolatrous altar with 2. Reg. 16. 16. He was high Priest in the Temple of
Jerusalem, as appears 2 Reg. 16. 2. and is acknowledged so to have been by
Genebrard, Chro^. anno mundi 3440. Vrias Pontifex inflectens se ad voluntatem
apostatae Achaz. 2. Reg. 16. See Lyranus upon the same place.
Vrias; and have joined with Ierem 26. 8. and 11.
Priests, Prophets, and people in sente^cing Jeremy to die. And how should any
have escaped the guilt of the blood of the innocent, yea of Innocence it
self, our Savior Christ Jesus, the Prophet of Prophets, by consenting unto
the blasphemous voices of the high Priest and Council of the Jews, in
adiudging unto death him who was and is the Lord of life?

5 Therefore the forecited Protestants, as they could not but acknowledge the
necessity of some supreme court and judgment, both Ecclesiastical and
civil, in several Churches, Kingdoms, and provinces, even under the Gospel,
for the final determiner of all contention: yet did they never think either
that judgment of such tribunals to be so infallible that it could not err, or
obedience of subjects so necessary, that sometime they might not dissent in
opinion.

6 Let M. Hooker speak for all: M. Hooker in his Ecclesiastical Policy,
Pref. page 29.
Not that I judge it (says he) allowable for men to observe those laws, which
in their hearts they are steadfastly persuaded to be against the law of God: And
a little after; An argument necessary and demonstratiue is such as being
proposed unto any man, and understood, the mind cannot choose but inwardly
assent. Any such reason discharges (I grant) the conscience, and sets it at
full liberty. In such case, according to S. August.
Augustine his Council, aut faciendum, aut patiendum, either must a man
persuade and practice a truth, or else willingly suffer for the truth by man's
sentence; which (according unto the text of Deuteronomie) may inflict death,
but has not the infallible power of damnation. Thus much of the example of the
Jewish tribunal. Now they proceed unto an application.

Of the application of the supreme Judge in the law of Moses.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And for so much as the occasion to have controversies ended, is as great now
as during the old Testament, the doubts of religion being as now many more, and
the danger of error no less grievous: whether therefore may it be thought that
our Hebr. 8. 6.
Testament which is established in better promises, is wanting of this
privilege? and so thereby the Ecclesiastical policy of Moses time, to be
preferred herein before that other which succeeded by Christ? With which only
last reason the Puritanes doubt not to Penrie in his supplication to ye high
Court of Parliament, p. 21. fine, says, That form of government which makes
our Savior Christ inferior unto Moses, is an impious, ungodly, and unlawful
government, contrary to the word, etc. See him further, page 22. and 23. and
peruse the occasion and circumstance of this his reason, and it will appear to
hold much more strong in this point, then in that other for which he urges it.
press their other Protestant brethren in matters of much smaller importance.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing the error of the Romanists in mis-applying
of the example of the Jewish government, for proof of the Papal Monarchy.
SECT. 2.
7 The objected argument can import no more then that which every Christian
will easily grant, to wit, that it is a greater impiety to violate the frame
of government which Christ would have to be perpetual in the Church, then it
was to have transgressed the ordinance which was delivered by the mouth of
Moses, and was established in the old Testament. Notwithstanding, as the Thesis
and position of Penrie, saying, that the same form of government, instituted
by Christ, cannot without impiety be abrogated, was true; so his Hypothesis or
application, assuming that this form fancied by him, was ordained by Christ,
is fully erroneous.

8 But as he failed in the proof of his manner of Presbytery, so do our
Aduersa^es in confirming their spiritual Monarchy. For whereas their Ab orb
condito vsque ad annum praesentem semper fuisse vnum Ecclesiae Praesidem and
Monarcham. Adam, Seth, Enos, -- Noah, Sem. -- Inter Patriarchas, Leui. --
Moses, Aaron. -- ita vsque ad Christum, -- adueniente Christo, quarta Monarchia
instituebatur, quae coepit a Petro principe Apostolorum, durauit in eius
successoribus vsque ad haec tempora, and durabit vsque ad consummationem mundi.
Catalogum Pontisicum multi referunt. Coccius Thesaur. Cathol. tom. 1. lib. 7.
art. 3 initio, etc.
Coccius labors to euince the necessity of Monarchical jurisdiction in the
Church, by the example of Gods people before the law from Adam unto Jacob; and
under the law from Moses and Aaron unto the last destruction of Jerusalem: and
lastly, after the law from Peter successively unto the now Pope; unto whom
their Cardinal Vltimum iudicium summi est Pontisicis. Bell^rm. lib. 4. de Romans
Pont. cap. 1.. Sed nec. Summus Pontifex absolute est super Ecclesiam vniuersam,
and super Council. generale, ita vt nullum in terris super se Iudicem agnoscat.
Idem lib. 2. de Council. cap. 17.
Bellarmine yields the last and highest judgment in the Church, yea even
above a general Council: we can show that this application which they use, by
analogy of the old Testament with the new, is utterly infirm, because in the
Jewish kingdom there was as well one chief civil In Deuteronomy. 17. which is the
text objected.
Judge, as one spiritual high Priest.

9 So that, as they would think it a non-sequitur for us to reason thus: There
was but one te^porall Judge in Israel, Ergo there ought to be but one universal
Monarch in the civil state of all Christendom: so must they confess it to be
a lame consequence in their own argument, whereby from one high Priest ordained
in the particular kingdom of the Jews, they contend to infer the supreme
jurisdiction of one universal Bishop over all Christians in the world;
contrary unto the ordinance of Christ, who (as has been See above lib. 2.
cap. 17.
confessed) did not choose one, but twelve Apostles, who were of equal
jurisdiction among themselves. Thus much of the first point of their
application, namely, of the singularity of that person whom they propound for
the universal Judge. We enter upon the next, showing

The second point of their application, viz. that the infallibility of truth
in this their one Judge (the Pope) is vainly pretended from the example of the
high Priest of the old Testament: proved by comparison of the Jewish and Romish
doctrine herein.
SECT. 3.
10 The two properties, which the heathen did discern to be primitiuely in
God, vnum and verum, that is, a personal unity, and verity; the same our
adversaries will have after a sort to be deriuatiuely in the Pope, unto * See
the former Section.
whom they ascribe an universal Monarchy, viz. one Judge, and in all
necessary doctrines an infallibility of judgment: whose interpretation they
account as the Interpretatio Papae est sensus Spiritus sancti. Bellarm. lib. 3.
de verbo Dei, cap. 4. and 5.
sense of the holy Ghost.

11 This comes now to be examined by the comparison of the old Testament. In
the Gospel written by S. John, we read that Ioh. 11. v. 51.
the chief Priests and Pharisees gathered a Council, wherein Caiphas being
high Priest that same year, prophesied that Christ should die for the Nation:
whereupon their Rhemists have set this stamp and observation: Rh^mists annot.
upon that place.
Marvel not that Christ preserves his truth as well by the unworthy as the
worthy Prelates thereof, the gifts of the holy Ghost following their Order and
Office, as we see here in Caiphas; and not their merits and persons. And if
this man being many ways wicked, and in part an usurper, and the Priesthood
being to decline, and to give place to the new ordinance of Christ, had yet
some assistance of God for utterance of truth, which Caiphas himself meant
not; how much more may we be assured that Christ will never leave Pete^s seat,
whose faith he promised should never fail, though the persons who occupy the
same were as ill as the bl^sphemous meuthes of heretics do affirm?

12 Upon the which pl^ce also their Canus concludes, that Ioh 11. [Hoc Ca^phas
non a seipso dixit, sed cum esset Pontifex illius anni, etc.] Qua ex re fit, vt
nostrorum Ponuficum vita quidem and opera, licet forte sint contraria Domino
Jesus, sed iudicia eorum -- vera erunt, -- vt que ad populi salutem sint
diuinitus instituta; imo ad^o a Spiritu sancto erunt, -- quia sc. qui ea
proserunt, sint Ecclesiae Christi Pontifices. Canus loc. Theol. lib. 5. cap.
vlt.. Ad id.
whatsoever judgments are delivered by the Popes of Rome for the behoof of
the whole Church, do therefore proceed from the spirit of God, because the
Popes do utter them. In so much that their Bishop Roffensis does herein triumph
and insult upon his Adversary, saying: Mirum est (Luthere) cum haec non
ignores, -- quod tam parum tribuis Pontifici Romano, cum vel apertissimu^ sit
ex Euangelio Iohanms, Caipham -- verum iudici^m protulisse. Roffensis Episcopus
contr^ Assert. Luther. verit. 3. page 12.
I marvel (o Luther,) seeing thou art not ignorant of these things, why thou
yeeldest so little unto the judgment of the Pope, considering that it is most
manifest, that Caiphas delivered a true judgment.

13 Thus confidently have our Adversaries patterned every Pope in the example
of the Jewish Caiphas: whereby Protestants (whom they call Rhemists. See above,
let. b.
heretics, and at whose ignorance they so much marvel) are provoked to wonder
how these Romanists could not discern that open truth, which, in confutation
of their comment, is confessed by their Cardinal Bellarmine, apparently
witnessing, that Alij dicunt Pontifi^e^ and Conciliu^ errasse* quantum ad
errorem propriae mentis, non tamen errasse in sententia quam protulit, vere
enim Jesus erat reus mortis, quia peccata nostra in seipso purganda susceperat.
and vere expediebat eum mori pro populo, quare Ioh 11. dicit Ca^pham
prophetasse. At lieet verba Caiphae bonum sensum recipiant, non tamen omnia;
cum enim ait de Christo, Blospemauit, quid adhuc egenius testimonijs? certe
tunc non prophetauit, led blasphemauit. Bellar. lib. 2. de Conc. cap. 8.. Alij
dicunt.
although those words of Caiphas, [when he said, one must die for the people,
etc.] had a good sense; yet, at the time that the Priests proceeded against
Christ in judgment, the same Caiphas [saying, He, (speaking of Christ) has
blasphemed, what need we any other witnesses?] did himself then not prophecy,
but blaspheme. Where we see (not to t^^uble our selves with their shallow Unto
the common objection, why it is so precisely noted by the E^angelist in the
text, He prophesied being high priest that same year, may be answered by that
note, which their Jesuit Maldonate does in part acknowledge: Ita diuina Dei
prouidentia factum fuisse. vt eius Pontificatus, qui in eam sententiam maxim
propensus erat, in eum annum incideret, quo anno de Christo mo^n tradendo
agendum erat, vt per eum diuinum expleretur Decretum, quo constitutum a Patre
erat, vt pro omnibus Christus moreretur. Maldonat. Iesuita comment. in Ioh. 11.
51. We may think that this was the whole cause of the Evangelists note, which
the Jesuit will allow to be but partly a reason thereof.
instance) how learned and witty our Adversaries have been to establish an
opinion of an infallible Judge by an example of a Judge blasphemously erroneous
in judgment, and thereupon to erect, as it were, a Roman Caiphas.

14 In the defense of the judgment of this See, their Cardinal Bellarmine
proceeds so far as to affirm, that Pontificem solum, vel cum suo
particulari Concilio aliquod in re dubia statuentem, sieve errare possit, sieve
non, esse ab omnibus sidelibus obedienter audie ndu^. Bellarm. lib. 4 de Romans
Pont. cap. 2.. Deinde.
whenever the Pope, albeit of himself, shall determine any doubtful
doctrine, he must be obeyed of all the faithful, although it was possible for
him to err therein. Which we may judge to be an high step unto the great
apostasy from the faith, especially seeing that Popes are See hereafter.
confessed to have taught and confidently defended heresy. And what
acquaintance these and other kind of Romish positions may seem to have with
the superstitious Rabbinish doctrines, their Hebrew Gloss will tell us.

15 In the text, which has been objected for the point in question, the people
of the Jews are commanded to hearken unto the sentence of the Judge, not
declining either unto the right hand, or to the left. Whereupon the Jewish Nec
declinabis ad dexteram nec ad sinistra^] Hic dicit Glossa Hebraica, Si dixerit
tibi quod dextra sit sinistra, vel sinistra dextra, talis sententia est tenenda.
Gloss has thus commented: If the Judge shall tell thee, that the right hand
is the left, and affirm the left to be the right, thou must believe him. Which
therefore their Lyranus does condemn of absurdity, Quod patet manifest
falsum: quia sententia nullius hominis, cuiuscunque sit authoritatis, est
tenenda, si contineat manifest falsitatem vel ^^rorem: and hoc patet per hoc
quod praemittitur in textu, [Et docuerint te iuxta legem.] Lyranus in hu^^
locum, Deuteronomy. 17.
because (says he) no judgment, if it be manifestly false, may be believed by
any man, of whatsoever authority he be. And M. M. Heart in his answer to D.
Rainolds in the place objected by the Apologists, page 262.
Heart notes the same sentence of Rabbi Selomoth to be foolish; which is plain
(says he) from the text of the same Scripture, which says, Thou shall do all
things which they teach thee according unto the law: wherefore to do all that
the Priests taught, is not meant of things ungodly, but only true and
consonant unto the law of God. By which we see, that the sentence of the Judge
is not absolutely infallible, as the Apologists pretend, but that the
resolution of a mansconscience is always determined by the appearance of Gods
law, that so God and not man may be the supreme Judge.

16 Our Adversaries will reply, that their rule of believing their Judge
holds only where the case is doubtful; but the Jewish Doctors challenge
belief of an error manifest. Is this the point? And what if their Judge shall
See in the next Section following.
call manifest truth into question and doubt? then how, alas, shall he that
must believe, discern the right hand from the left? This the sentence of
Caiphas does teach us. Finally, that our readers may see what Proctors the
Apologists have chosen to further their cause in this question of supreme
judgment, we hold it meet to show how vnmateriall they are in the defense of
Rabbinish authority, by their own doctrines, as they are related by a
Protestant author.

17 Regula Catholica in scriptis Rabbinicis est, Hizzaher, etc. id est, memento
potius sermonis Scribarum quam sermonis legis Mosis. Buxdorfius Synag. Iud.
cap. 1.
It is a general rule among the Jewish Rabbis (says he,) to teach men to be
more mindful of the words of the Scribes, then of the law of Moses: among whom
Sic in tractatu eorum Thalmudico Rabbi Iochanan: vnicuique Sabbatum sic vt
decet, iusque eius and ordinatio requirunt, obseruanti peceata condonantur, ita

Rabbi Iochanan taught, that a man by observing the Sabbath as he ought,
obtains remission of his sins, yea although in sanctisying thereof he shall
commit Idolatry. This one is set but for an example of many confessed
paradoxes, defended by Rabbis; who notwithstanding for authorizing their own
Traditions, decreed, that Regula Rabbinica est; -- Quicunque transgreditur
quodcunque Sapientes nostri locu^i suerunt, i^ suppl^cio mortis obnoxious est,
pe^inde vt scriptum est, Diss^pans sepem, momordebit cum serpens. -- Et

habenda est quam sermonum sieve legis ipsius. Buxdorf. ibid. cap. 2.
whosoever shall transgress against that which our wisemen (meaning the
Rabbis themselves) have decreed, shall be guilty of death. And lest that our
Adversaries might possibly regest, that yet their supreme Judge is so prevented
by Christ, whose vicar he is, that he cannot possibly depart from the sincere
faith. Therefore do we exhibit

A demonstration of the fallibilitie of the Papal judgment (we refer their
haresies unto their proper places,) by examples of contradictions of the Popes:
from the confession of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
18 Erasmus is a witness, whom our Adversaries have called for, and have
appropriated him unto their Roman party, who discovering the mystery of this
now Romish doctrine, does annihilate the pretense thereof, saying, that Porro
si verum est, quod quidam asseuerant, Romans Pontificem errore iudic^ali non

any thing from his judgment, what need has the Church of general Councels, or

19 But if this objection might (as it cannot) be possibly assoiled, yet how
will our Adversaries answer, when their Imo qui fit, vt Pontificis huius

thing either in proper, or in common, the one affirming it iudicially, the
other denying it; next in the question of divorce in the case of heresy, Pope
Celestine defends it, Pope Innocentius the 3. gainsaieth it; besides Pelagius
commanded that Subdeacons should put away their wives, whom they had lawfully

he was forced by the judgment of the University of Paris to recant his former

no foundation upon such Judges, in whom there is found the spirit of manifold
contradictions. We fear tediousness, and therefore draw unto

judgment of the Church of Rome.

21 Wherein we choose rather to be directed by their own more moderate
Doctors. Erasmus complains of them Hune locum quidam eo torquent, quasi
parendum sit omnibus, quae praecipiunt Episcopi, aut praepositi etiam impij, ob
muneris authoritatem, cum Christus de ijs loquatur, qui recte docerentlegem
Mosaicam, non qui suis constitutiunculis illaquearent homines -- Quis ferat cos
aduersus Christi doctrinam fixis and resixis legibus, meram tyra^nidem
exercentes, suo quaestu and maiestate omnia metientes? -- Non sedent in
Cathedra Euangelica. sed in Cathedra Simonis Magi, aut Caiphae. Erasmus annot.
in hunc lecum.
who detort this place of Scripture to prove, that we are to obey whatsoever
the Bishops and governors of the Church, although they be wicked ones, shall
prescribe, when as Christ speaks of them who rightly teach Moses law, not
insnaring men with their own Constitutions, as some do, who seeking their own
honor and profit, sit in the chair of Caiphas.

22 But this witness will seem to be too shrewd, and therefore shall hardly
escape a buffeting, wherefore we are contented to admit of others, as first
their preacher Sedent super Cathedram Moysis.] Cum bona docebant, hoc est, ea
quae Moses praedixerat, and docuerat, audiendi erant. -- Sed a falsa doctrina
Pharisaeorum cauendum est. Stella in Luc. 12. tom. 2. page 72.
Stella [They sit in the chair of Moses:] That is (says he,) so far forth
as they teach that Moses taught, they must be heard, otherwise we are to beware
of them. Non esse illis obediendum fi quid male praecipiant aut doceant: nam si
eis obediendum est, quoniam in Cathedra sedent Moysis, non est ergo eis
obediendum, quando aliquid contra eam Cathedram docent aut praecipiunt. I
ansen. Concord. in Mat. 23. 2. cap. 120. page 819.
For if we ought to obey them, because they sit in the chair of Moses, then it
follows (says their Bishop Iansenius,) that they may not be obeyed, when
they command any thing contrary unto that chair; which Author reconcileth two
Scriptures, the one where Christ willed men to beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees, and this other where he commands them to [do as they say:] Matthew.
16. 6. Cauete de fermento Pharisaeorum.] Si huiusmodi Pharisaeorum doctrina hic
per fermentum, cauenda significatur, quomodo post dicit Dominus, [Sedent super
Cathedra^ moysis, quod dixerint facite.] Proinde ad literam Dominus non
quamlibet Pharisaeorum doctrinam significare voluit, sed eam qua doceba^t, quae
vere ipsorum erant mandata hominum, aut inutilia plane, aut mandatis Dei
aduersa. Iansen. Concord. in eum locum Matthew. cap. 64.
that is, (says he) do not reject all their doctrines, but such as are
contrarte unto the law of Moses. More plainly their Jesuit Maldonate; Dominus
per [Cathedram Mosis] non de Pharisaeorum doctrina intelligit, sed de doctrina
legis ac Mosis loquitur: perinde enim est, acfi dixerit, Omnia quae Lex ac
Moses vobis dixerint. Maldonat. Ies. comment in hunc locum Matthew.
Christ (says he) by the chair of Moses did not understand the doctrine of
the Pharisees, but the doctrine of the law of Moses.

23 What chair then do those our Adversaries sit in, who to the aduantaging of
the Papal authority, do understand by Moses chair an infallibility of
judgment in the Pharisees and Priests of the law? We may conjecture thereof by
their Jesuit Salmeron, who confessing that they of whom Christ speaks, Non
erant audiendi, quando Christum negabant esse Messiam, vel Christum, quia haec
non de Cathedra docebant. Salmeron Ies. tom. 4. part 3. tract. 32.. Obijcies.
page 609.
were not to be obeyed when they denied Christ to be the Messiah, for then they
speak not out of the chair: and yet we know that they denied Christ by the
authority of their see above c. 15.. 3.
Council; which shows that the chair of Moses must signify the succession
of true doctrine, without reference unto the authority of men's persons.

24 But let their Arias Montanus make up our conclusion from the same Chapter,
verse. 13. [W^e unto you Scribes and Pharisees, for you shut the kingdom of God
before men; for neither do you your selves go in thither, neither do you suffer
others to enter in:] Multa erant in Scripturis mysteria ad regnum coelorum
pertinentia, -- sed Pharisaei neque his attendebant, neque altos ad haec
instruebant, aut instrui patiebantur: sed toti in illis erant, vt nudarum
caeremoniarum obseruationem sine explicatione significationum ipsarum
inculcarent: -- neque permittebant vt quisquam de s^o^is Scripturis vol
cogitarent, nedum diceret quicquam, nisi se consultis, and ex suarum
interpretationum praescripto. Ita illi claudebant regnum Dei ante homin^s,
neque enim hominibus, id est, caeteris a se licebat de Scripturis agere: sie
enim dic^bant caeco illi restituto, [In peccatis natus es totus, and vis docere
nos?] Et sequitur, [neque ipsi intrabant] vt patet ex hoc testimonio, quod
nollent vt quisquam de Christo vel quam verissima illis afferret. Arias
Montanus in Matthew. 23. page 80. in illa verba [Quia clauditis.]
There were many mysteries in Scriptures (says he) concerning the way unto
Gods kingdom, which the Pharisees neglected that either themselves or others
should know, but were wholly bent to the authorizing of their own naked
constitutions, which they delivered void of expositions, not suffering any man
to think, much less to speak any thing of Scripture, without their advice
and prescript of their expositions, as appears by their saying to the blind
man: Thou art borne in sin, and do thou teach us?

25 Which affoordeth us these due considerations: first, that those professors
are most doubtfully, or rather desperately erroneous, who make their chair of
authority to be an infallible argument of the truth of their doctrine, and not
contrary-wise the appearance of doctrine in Scripture to be the chair wherein
men's consciences may take their last rest and resolution, because (as S.
Augustine says,) Sedem Ecclesiasticam (inquit Augustinus) sana doctrina
constituit. Staple^on. Antidot. in Matthew. 23. page 194.
It is a sound doctrine which constituteth a chair.

26 Secondly, in that Christ commanded men to obey those Pharisees, but
quatenus, that is, so far only (in doctrines necessarily belonging unto the
kingdom of God,) as they truly proceeded out of Moses chair, which signifies
the written law of Moses: we are justified in our profession to think that in
such cases not the authority of man, but the law written is the supreme Judge
of men's consciences.

27 Thirdly, that those professors, who upon the Priestly authority of the
Jewish Synagogue (which idolatrously and blasphemously erred from truth) would
rear up the opinion of an infallibility of judgment in their Popes, whom our
Adversaries have confessed to have been possessed with contradictions, and (as
will be See hereafter.
acknowledged) were plunged in heresies, causes us to fear that the pretended
chair of truth is translated into the form of the chair of apostasy.

28 Lastly, that authority of the external visible Judge, (which is a
Council) for the deciding of doubtful points of controversies, wherein the
direct law of God only, and not man's peremptory will and fancy is made the
chair, Protestants do more willingly See above.
acknowledge, then do our Adversaries, who indeed draw too near the now Jewish
presumption, (which our Buxdorfius has related,) whereby they (viz. Jews) do
profess, Rabbi Isaac Abhuhabh, anno Christi 1493. scribit in libro Menoras
Hammaor, Omni quodcunque Rabbini nostri in concionibus and mysticis, aut
allegoricis explicationibus docuerunt and loquuti sunt, nos non minus firmiter
atque been quam legi Mosis fidem adiungere tenemur. In quo si quid inueniatur
quod nobis hyperbolicum, vel naturae prorsus contrarium videtur, -- nos culpam
illam intellectui nostro defectuoso, non autem verbis ipsorum ascribere
debemus. Buxdorfius lib. Synag. Iudaic. cap. 1. page 62.
that they are bound to give as great belief unto the mystical and
allegorical expositions of the Rabbis, as unto the law of Moses: wherein if
any thing (say they) be delivered which may seem to be repugnant unto nature,
we must impute this unto the defect of our understanding, and not unto the
words of our Doctors. I would but ask the Romanists, whether they think that
there is any thing in all the profession of the Jews, which is a greater bar
to hinder their conversion unto the faith of Christ then this thraldom of
their souls by believing, not what the light of Scripture may teach their own
judgment, but what that their prejudice does forestall, which they have in the
judgment of their teachers; who by their cloudie allegories do darken and
dim the light of Scriptures. This granted (which none can deny) by the
application hereof their like presumption is confuted, and our religion better
fortified and established.

CHAP. XVI. Concerning the conclusion of the Apologists Demonstration of their
Romish faith, from the faith of the Jewish Rabbis.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
By which so many foresaid examples of our Catholic faith, thus affirmed by
the ancient Jews that lived before Christ's coming, it is made further
probable, that our religion is not new or lately devised, but most ancient and
undoubtedly Apostolic: which point is made as yet much more clear by that
which is hereafter See hereafter, tract. 1. sect. 7. and 8.
alleged concerning the Roman Church being converted in the Apostles time,
and her not being sit hence changed in religion.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By irrefutable arguments conuincing the gross
sophistry of the Apologists Demonstration out of the ancient Jews, by a
Demonstration from the faith of more ancient and more religious Jews: from the
confessions of our learned Adversaries, in many principal points belonging,
First unto moral duties concerning man.
SECT. 1.
THe argument which the Apologists have taken from the faith of ancient Jews,
for the confirmation of (as they say) their Catholic faith, they have
entitled a Demonstration, whereby is signified a reason so evident and
infallible, that every discreet Reader must thereunto forthwith yield his
assent: and hereupon have they founded their conclusion, to believe that the
Roman religion is most ancient and undoubtedly Apostolic: which argument
has been found to be rather such a demonstration of the want of judgment in
their Galatinus, Coccius, and these Apologists, as though they had studied and
professed to make themselves notoriously vain: because the foundation almost
of all their proofs is the Jewish Thalmud, and Cabala, which our Adversaries
confess to be no better then two muddie lakes, and sinkes of See above cap. ^
Sect. 6.
fabulous and blasphemous Traditions.

2 But let them set upon this argument (if they can) an edge of steel; the
sharper it is, and the more vehemently they st^ike Protestants therewith, the
more deadly will it wound themselves, when by a just retorsion it shall be
turned (as it were) into their own bowels; as will appear by comparing the
opinions of the Jews and of Romanists together.

3 True justifying faith is described by S. Paul, to be that which Galat. 5. 6.
works by love, which love S. John will have discerned by Ioh. 15. 10.
keeping Gods commandments; which comma^dements Christ, by often pressing the
Scriptures, does signify to be written in the old Testament: wherein we read
Luit. 18. Non reuelabis turpitudinem.]
Leuit. 18. of degres of kindred wherein marriage is forbidden. These laws the
Est imprimis obseruandum inter nos and aduersarios conuenire, praecepta
Leuitici non obligare Christianos, quatenus proprie Leuitica, id est, positiua
and iudicialia sunt, sed tantum quatenus naturalia: Sed tota quaestio est, an
omnia illa praecepta quae habent^^ in ^euitico de grad^bus cognationis, sint
naturalia, an aliqua vel omnia iudicialia. Et quidem aduersarij volunt omnia
esse naturalia, ac proinde indispensabilia per Ecclesiam.
Protestants interpret to issue from the law of nature (says Cardinal
Bellarmine) and to be indispensable: Nos autem docemus non esse omnia
naturalia, and ideo in quibusdam posse per Ecclesiam dispensari, vt Conc Trid.
affirmat ess. 24. can. 3. Bellar. lib. 1. de Matrim. cap. 27. post principium.
but we (says he) hold that some of those laws are not natural, but
judicial, and therefore may be dispensed with, according unto the Decree of
the Council of Trent: wherein he is held no better then Anathema that shall
not believe it: which belief notwithstanding the Jews did never conceive, who
are known to have kept these laws inviolable. This question is of moment,
because (as appears by the Apostle) it can be no pure virgin Church, which
shall approve and justify an act of 1. Cor. 5.
Incest.

4 Now the Pope (who as our Adversaries believe, Papa in rebus morum
definiendis, vel declarandis errare non potest. Azorius Ies. part 2. lib. 5.
cap. 3.. Vltimo.
cannot err in determining of moral points of doctrine) has dispensed with
diverse degrees of marriage forbidden in Leuiticus, as namely (witnessing their
own Jesuit) Rarius concesserit Romans Pont. vt matrimoniu^ contraheretur inter
Amitam vel Materteram, and consobrinum, quam inter patruum vel auunculum, and
consobrinum, -- inter Henricum octanum and vxorem fratris sui defuncti. Idem
ibid.. Tertio quae^itur. and. Quarta, etc.
by allowing the Ant to marry with her Nephew, and a King to join in wedlock
with his brothers wife. Which kind of matches are so fully incestuous, that
Ambrose in Epist. ad Paternum consulentem an liceret neptem ex filia filio suo
coniungi -- ita reseribit: Ego autem prohibitum iure diuino assero, quia cum

a^ctioris necessitudinis, interdictum arbit^or. -- Haec and alia Ambrosiu^
constanter affirmans per huiusmodi concubitus and diu^num, and naturae ius

Ambrose, Gregory, Hierome, Augustine (as their Catharinus testifies) did
abhor the transgressions of these laws, as impious and unnatural. Insomuch
that when many Fathers, and seven Universities are objected unto our
Adversaries, in confutation of their defense of this kind of incest, their
Author and champion in that cause, is enforced to seek into corners for the
patronage of their doctrine, and in the end to prefer the Vt facian^us septem

judgment of the younger Divines.

5 Secondly, the Romish profession of sovereignty over Kings, to depose them,
is made not only visible unto us by their books and Bulls, but palpable also
by their practice. Will they suffer the ancient Jewish Rabbis to be our
Judges? or will they allow Moses the Prophet of God, and the first proclaimer
of Gods written law, to be one of the ancient Rabbis? then let them hear
their own Jesuit Salmeron, witnessing in this case, and confessing, that Missa
potestate spirituali legis naturae, vel Moysi, quae minor erat regia potestate
in veteri Testamento; and ideo etiam summi Sacerdotes regibus subdebantur,
sicut etiamapud Gentiles: de potestate Ecclesiastica disserendum. Salmeron Ies.
comment. Tom. 12. tract. 63.. Sed nunc. page 428. Et paulo ante: Long tamen
eminet potestas spir^tualis noui Testamenti.. Quod autem.
under Moses in the old Testament, the regal law had the prehemine^ce, and the
high Priests were subject unto the Kings. But because the Romanists refuse to
be Jewish in this point, which the Apostles have prescribed unto all
Christians, their condemnation will be more just.

6 Thirdly, the Romanists admit none unto sacred Orders without a solemn vow
of single life; and if it happen that any by entering into the state of
matrimony shall break that vow, his marriage is commanded to be dissolved. In
brief, the Protestant Ministers who are married, are by them therefore called
carnal and unclean: albeit that this the Priests marriage (as our Adversaries
have See above cap. 2.. 33.
confessed) was not forbidden either in the old or new Testament. And as for
the Monastical vow, if that had been anciently Jewish, then would not their
Coccius Thesaur. Cath. Tom. 2. lib. 4. art. 2. in fine.
Coccius for proof thereof, have been contented with the example of the
Essaei, who were the Sea above cap. 10.. 2..
last sect among the Jews. But if Christ have commanded us to honor the
Physician, why should the Romanists so much (...), as to contemn the physic
which Christ prescribes by his Apostle, which is, 1. Cor. 7. 2.
for avoiding of fornication to have a wife? Howsoever, the Jewish Church was
so far more pure then the now Romish, in as much as (which has been See
above lib. 1. cap. 2.. 36.
confessed) this allows stews, and that did not.

A second confutation in points concerning Gods worship.
SECT. 2.
7 First, God will be known to be a Exodus 20. 5.
jealous God, which argues the faith of that Church to be the sounder, which
does more sincerely affect the integrity of Gods worship: whereof we now seek
an indifferent trial. First Protestants and Romanists are at a double ods
about Images: the one is the representing, the other is the worshipping of him
by an Image. Their Jesuit Vasquez does observe, that Mayor de imagine ipsius
Dei secundum se, non vt incarnati, controuersia est^an scilicet liceat ^^m
depingere? qua in re cum haereticis pugnandum est: eo tamen difficilior cu^ eis
erit congressus, quod suae partis viros Catholicos propugnatores habea^t. --
Paulo post. Opinio quamuis non adeo certa est, vt tanquam fidei dogma sit
amplectenda, multo tamen verior mihi videtur, and quae sine temeritate contra
communem Ecclesiae vsum negari non potest: Ea vero in vniuersum asserit,
Trinitate^ depingere ex natura rei licitu^ esse. He reckons for the defenders
of this opinion, Palud Caiet Wald. Cathar. Didac. Payua, Sander. Tu^^ian.
Vasquez Ies. lib. 2. de Adorat. disp. 3. cap. 3. initio. and. Tertia ergo.
it is the common use of their Church to have the picture of God and of the
Trinity; and yet confesses, that the Church of God among the Jews Ego vero
aliter existimo respondendum. Pri^um Exodus 20. and Deuteronomy. 4. non solum puto
prohiberi imaginem Dei primo illo modo, ne scilicet populus e^rore deceptus
veilet ei effigiem aliquam exprimere, qua putaret ad vi^um deitatem ipsam
repraesentari; sed quamcunque imaginem ipsi^s Dei, i^^o and cuiuscunque
alterius, ob periculum, cui populus ille subiacebat, vt seq* disputatione
patebit: ob id tamen non est dicendum, ex natura rei illicitum esse Deum
depingere, sed justice de causis a Deo in veteri Testamento fuisse prohibitum.
Vasquez quo supra. cap. 4.. Ego vero.
was forbidden to make any picture of God at all: which he notes to be the
doctrine also of See the testimony of Vasquez at the letters, ^ and d.
Protestants: with whom (as he also testifies) diverse of the Romish School
Secunda sententia est Henrici. Quodlib. 10. qu. 6. Abulen. in cap. 4. Deuteronomy. q.

do consent, and that from the judgment of ancient Fathers, who have so
utterly condemned all figuring of God, that the same Jesuit is glad for his
last refuge to grant, that Secundo obijciunt nobis Patres compl^res, qui dicunt
nephas esse simulacl^rum and imaginem Deo collocare. Sic Lactant. lib 2. divine.

multitudinis; quo cessante, vt admonuit Council. Trident. diligenti solicitudine
and doctrina pastorum, manifestum est eas imagines iure damnari non posse. Idem
ibid. cap. 4.. Secundo obijciunt.
the Fathers did think such imagerie to be unlawful, although (says he) not
in it self, yet because of the danger of idolatry in the rude multitude.

8 The difference in the second question concerning the worshipping of Christ
in an Image, is no less then the former: whereof their Jesuit Gretzerus
auoweth, calling it their Nunc explicandum, quo genere cultus colenda sit, non
modo prima illa crux Christi, sed and omnes imagines, and signa crucis.
Asserimus cum sententia communiori, and in scholis magis trita crucem colendam
esse latri^, hoc est, cultu diuino, non quidem per se, sed per aliud; non
absolute, sed cum habitudine and respectu ad prototypum. Gretzerus Ies. lib. 1.
de Cruce, cap. 49 in^tio.
common judgment, that the cross of Christ is to be worshipped, although
improperly, with Latria, which is an honor properly due unto God. But what was
the profession of the ancient people of God among the Jews? Their Jesuit
Vasquez does tell us of Permulti enim affirmant, nunquam nec in lege veteri
imaginum picturam, aut sculpturam statuarum, imo nec ipsarum debitum cultum,
sed solum idololatriae adorationem fuisse pohibitam; ne scilicet eas populus
cultu diuino, sicut Gert les sua idola, prosequeretur: and cites for the
defenders of this opinion, Beda, Jonas Aurelianensis, D. Thomas, Burgensis,
Waldensis, Caietanus, Alanus Copus, Sanderus, Alphonsus de Castro, Fr. Turrian.
Pa^melius. Vasquez Ies quo supra, lib. 2. disp. 4. cap. 1.
diverse Romish Doctors, among whom he mentions Caietan, Sanders, Turrian,
and Pammelius, who think (says he) that God did not prohibit unto those his
people all adoration of Images, but only that worship which is idolatrous: yet
does he recko^ up other Romanists, Non pauciores nec inferioris notae authors
oppositam opinionem, quae mihi multo probabilior vi^a est, amplectuntur:
Iudaeis, nimirum, non sol^m adorationem illam Gentilium, quae naturali iure
prohibita est, verumetiam q^emlibet vsum imaginum and statuarum praecepto Dei
positiuo, Exodus 20. fuisse interdictum. Sententia est Richardi, Alexandri,
Alberti, Bonauentura, Palud^ni, Henrici, Catharini, Martini de Ayala, Fr.
Horantij, Alani Copi, Clictouaei. Vasquez ibid. cap. 2 initio.
who (as he says) were not either fewer in number, or inferior in estimation,
who held the contrary; and which the Jesuit himself does judge to be the
more probable opinion: which is indeed more then probable, as is evident out of
Josephus, from whom their Jesuit Gretzerus proves, that Josephus lib. 15.
cap. 11. Nihil Iudaeis tam molestum fuit, quam Trophaea, qui cum putarent armis
contectas imagines quarum vsus interdictus est nostris legibus, indignissime
eas ferebant. Gretzer. de Cruce, l. 1. c. 44. page 121.
the Jews did hate the very Images of men in their heathenish Trophies, as
being forbidden them by God.

9 Secondly, as the faithful worshipper must take heed in what he honors
God, so must he beware unto whom he commends the prayers of his mouth and
thoughts, lest he attribute unto any soul departed (by inuocating) the power
of understanding of all the cases of men in the world, if happily all should pray
unto that one: which is a property whereby ancient Fathers discerned the
deity of the holy Ghost. Now the Romanists teach this universal Invocation to
be communicable unto every Saint departed, calling the Protestants See above
lib. 2 cap. 12. Sect. 1.
impious for denying it: notwithstanding they themselves confessed the Sea
ibid. Sect. 3.
Invocation of souls departed not to have been in use among the Jews, in the
state of the old Testament, for fear of Idolatry: nor yet taught unto them in
the new Testament at their first conversion unto the faith of Christ. But why?
Because (say our Adversaries) those Jews would have thought it an hard matter
to be commanded to pray unto Saints departed: so merely strangers were those
true Jews unto this Romish article of Invocation.

10 Thirdly, true prayer is the breath of true faith, which faith will always
fear to offer unto God Eccles. 5. 2.
the sacrifice of fools: of which kind, in the opinion of Protestants, are all
those prayers which men of capacity and understanding do offer in a tongue
which they do not understand. Now the Romish Council of Trent has Ecclesia
nostra prohibet ne diuina officia, and praesertim Missae sacrificium vulgata
lingua celebretur: nam postremum Council. Trid. Sess. 23. cap. 8, and 9. tra lit
aliter, docentes Anathemate esse percellendos. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 14 comm. in
1. Cor. 16. disp. 30 page 257. and Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, ca. 16.
Ledesima Ies. lib. de diuinis script. cap. 13.
forbidden that the public prayers of the Church should be used in the vulgar
and common language of Christian people, fixing an Anathema upon every one
that shall dare to affirm the contrary; albeit the Rabbin Aben Ezra
dehortatur ne quis talibus vtatur orationibus, in quibus non intelligitur quid
oratur. As says our Mercerus, com. in Ecclesiasten. 5. 2. page 113.
Aben Ezra does dehort men from using prayers which they do not understand. And
it cannot be denied but that the Church of the Jews, by Gods ordinance, under
Moses, had their public service in Hebrew, their mother tongue.

11 Fourthly, faith is that instrument, which makes the Romans 10. 10.
heart to believe unto justification, and the mouth to confess unto salvation:
and therefore desires to enjoy the prerogative which it has in Christ, which
is by (although unto God only) unfeigned confession, and to expect the grace of
remission of sins: contrary-wise the Romanists teach such a See above lib. 2
cap. 14. Sect. 3.
necessity of auricular confession unto the Priest, that without this
dependence either in act, or in vow and purpose, no man may hope for a pardon
at Gods hands. Will the Apologists suffer the state of the true Iudaisme to be
our example? See ibid.
Among the Jews (as their Lyra and Cardinal Tolet have witnessed) confession
of particular sins unto the Priest was not necessary.

12 Fifthly, faith fasteneth upon the promise of God, made not only unto it
self, but even unto the seed also, so far as the offspring shall not reject
the covenant of God. Concerning this point the Romanists have taught, that See
above lib. 2 cap. 13. Sect. 1.
no child born of Christian parents, dying without baptism, can inherit life:
notwithstanding that in the old Testament, where (as has been confessed) See
ibid, Sect. 6
Circumcision was a Sacrament of remission of original sin, the children
dying uncircumcised were not excluded from grace. Our Adversaries will
peradventure object, that the state of the new Testament is more perfect, and
therefore the Sacraments thereof more necessary: but let them from this
objection consider, whether that the grace of God be not hereby more commended,
that it issues immediately upon the seed of the faithful, and not by an
absolute necessity unto Elements; and whether the grace be not greater, where
the danger of the child's damnation is less. Now then (that we may stand unto
the analogy, which is between the seals of both the covenants, Circumcision
of the old, and Baptism of the new) Infantulos aegrotantes die octauo non
circumcidunt, sed circumcisionem differunt vsque eo dum valetudinem
recuperarint. Our Buxdorsius out of the Gloss of the Thalmud. Buxdorsius
Synag. Iud. cap. 2.
the Jews did not circumcise their children at the eight day as God had
commanded, if they were sick at that time, but deferred it until the child
had gathered strength. And shall; we do not say: the contemptuous, but
religious delay of Baptism, with intent that the Sacrament may be more
solemnly performed, be held damnable among Christians?

Other articles and principles of the faith of the Church, even the holy
Scriptures, held by Protestants, and confirmed by the exposition of the ancient
Jews: from the consession of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
13 Divine Scriptures are the common principles and foundation of faith, which
it eyeth especially in three points, integrity, community, and sufficiency.

First, in the integrity Protestants require two things, the perfect Canon of
Scriptures of the old Testament, and translation immediately derived from the
Hebrew text. Of the Canon of the books of the old law, the Romish Council of
Trent has thus defined: Bellarm. and others. See above in this cap. Sect. 2.
and Co^cius Thesaur.
The books of Tobie, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Maccabees are
Canonical: notwithstanding that the Jews have (as has been confessed) See
ibid.
rejected all these books: unto which judgment of the Jews all the most See
hereafter.
ancient Christian Churches did wholly subscribe. And why should not we also?

14 Concerning the integrity of translation, that, without all doubt, must be
held more pure, which agrees with the first original. Now our Aduersa^ies
repr^hend Protestants for ascribing Nimium tribuunt (speaking of Protestants)
Hebraeae Editioni. -- quam non semel purissimum fontem appellant. Bellarm. lib.
2. de verbo Dei, cap. 2. initio.
too much unto the Hebrew copies, and for calling them the purest fountains.
But why, are they not most pure? This is a great and necessary controversy,
wherein we contend about the conduits of pure water from the fountain of life.
Many Romanists, seeking (as it may seem) to prejudice the judgment of
Protestants, for translating from the Hebrew Bible, and not from their vulgar
Latin, have accused the Jewish Rabbis of sacrilegious malice in Hebraici
codices Rabbinorum and aliorum Ecclesiae hostiu^ fraud saepe potuerunt

corrupting those sacred sountains in envy against Christ: and the accusers,
who appear out of the Romish School, are Pintus, Christinopolitanus, Canus,
besides other younger Divines, and also Gregory Valentia, and Sacroboscus, both
Jesuits.

15 But the Jews will not want advocates even out of the Roman School to
plead for them, not only affirming, but proving also the integrity of the
Jews in this point. For first their Cui sententiae ne assentiar, prohibet me
D. Hieronymi translatio, quae in locis, de quibus inter nos and Iudaeos
controuersia est, semper fere cum hac Hebraeo^um punctuaria expositione maxim
consentit. -- Huc accedit Augustini persuasio, quod nullus vnqua^ sanae mentis
credere poterit, Iudaeos quantum lib^t ^alos and peruersos, in codicibus tam
mu^ti^, and tam long lateque dispersis, in vnum conuenisse, and odio
Christianorum in corruptionem suorum voluminum con^pir^sse. Senensis Bibliot.
lib. 3. page 153. and deinc^ps, and lib. 8. page 630. See also Pererius Ies. com
in Genesis 8. 7.. Ast ego.
Senensis professes plainly, that he cannot believe those accusations, being
induced hereunto (as himself says) by the authority of Hierome and S.
Augustine, who held it to be a note of madness in any one, who should imagine
that the Jews did conspire together for the corruption of Scriptures.

16 What the reasons are (to omit other witnesses) Cardinal Bellarmine will
satisfy for all: he produces this argument out of Origin and Hierome; Alij
zelo quidem bono, sed nescio an secundu^ scientiam, omnin^ contendunt Iudaeos
in odium Christianae fidei studiose deprauasse and corrupisse multa loca
Scripturarum. -- Pugnant autem aduersus hanc sententiam grauissima argumenta:
primum Origin. in lib 8. in Es. vt Hieron. ref^rt in Esa. 6. qui in hunc modum
ratiocinatur* si Scripturas Hebraei aliquando corruperunt, vel id fecerunt ante
Christi aduentum, vel postea: si ante, quare Christus and Apostoli nunquam eos
de tam insigni crimine reprehenderunt, praesertim cum leuiora non tacuerint?
Quare Dominus ait Johan. 5. Scruta^^^ Scripturas; and Matthew. 23. Sedent super
Cathedram, etc? cui credibile est, ad corruptas Scripturas legendas sine v^la
praemonitione homines inuitasse? Sin autem post Christi aduentum id factum est.
quo pacto testimonia quae a Christo and Apostols citantur, omnia fere nunc
inueniuntur in Mose and Prophetis? Hoc Hieronymi and Origenis argumentum est.
--
If the Jews (say they) corrupted the Scriptures, they must have done it
either before, or after the coming of Christ. If before, then would Christ or
his Apostles have reproved them for so great a crime as this, seeing they
reprehended them for lesser faults; would Christ have invited them to read the
Scriptures without premonishing them to take heed of reading the Scriptures
which were corrupted, if then there had been that offense? If any shall say,
that they were corrupted since; how then comes it to pass that almost all the
Scriptures cited by Christ and his Apostles are yet found in the Bible of the
Jews?

17 Another argument is taken from S. Augustine, who says, that the Alterum
argumentum est ex Augustino in lib. 15. de Ciuit. c. 13. vbi probat quod non
videtur vllo modo credibile, Iudaeos voluisse suis codicibus eripere veritatem,
vt nostris detraherent authoritatem; and etiamsi voluissent, non sit verisimile
potuisse. --
Jews neither could, nor would corrupt them. And lest any might suspect that
since those times of Hierome and Augustine they have been violated, their
foresaid Cardinal does undertake their further defense, saying, that the Dicet
aliquis, generalem hanc deprauationem Heb. codicum post Hieron and Augustini
tempora acc^disse. -- At Augustini rations omni tempore locum habent. --
arguments used by the Fathers, do as w^l plead for the time to come, as the
time past. Which he confirms from the Tertium argumentum sumi potest ab
incredibili religione Iudaeorum erga sacros libros: scribit Philo lib. de
egress. ex Aegypto, vt citatur ab Fuseb. 8 2. Praep. Euang -- quemlibet Iudaeum
centies potius morituru^, quam vt pater^tur legem in aliquo immutari. --
religious zeal of the elder Jews, who (as Philo reports) would choose
rather to die an hundred deaths, then to suffer the Scriptures to be altered in
any thing: and also of the later Jews, De superstitione autem recentio^^
Iudaeorum, qui legem fere vt numen adorant, and si aliquando in terram
ceciderit, ieiuniu^ publicum indicunt. Hactenis. Bellar. lib. 2. de verbo Dei,
c. 2.. His igitur omissis. and deinceps.
who so much adore the book of the law, that if it happen to fall upon the
earth, they denounce a public fast in the way of penance.

18 In brief, their Jesuit Acosta adds another argument, proving that
although the Jews had been bent to abuse the holy writ, yet could they not
have effected such a mischief: Hebraica^ esse authentica^ dubitare non possun
us, and quamu^ Iudaica perfidia atque inuidia conata sit -- fonte^, ipsum
sermone^ Dei inficere, tamen nullo modo credendu^ est eis licuisse quicquid
lubuit; neque defuere in Ecclesia docti viri, quoru^ studio co^seruati sunt
codices Hebraici, ex quibus tuto potest Catholicus Doctor sacros sensus
elicere, diuina dogmata confirmare, and Iudaeos ipsos conuincere. Acosta Ies.
l. 2. de Christo, c. 16. p. 104.
Because there were never wanting in the Church learned men, by whose study
and care the sacred Scriptures would have b^^ preserved: and therefore does the
same Author not doubt to call the Hebrew edition authentical.

19 As for the quarrel which Driedo and some others took against it, because
of the Points, which the Rabbis added for the better understanding of the
text, it is answered by their Cardinal, that Driedo dicit irrepsisse errores
ignorantia Rabbinorum, qui addiderunt puncta. -- Caeterum non tanti momenti
sunt eiusmodi errores, vt in eis quae ad fidem and bonos mores pertinent,
sacrae Scripturae integritas desideretur, -- puncta enim illa extrinsecus
addita sunt nec textum mutant. Itaque possumus, si volumus puncta detrahere.
Bellar. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 2.. Caeterum fine.
those errors are not so great that they may detract from the integrity of
the Hebrew Scripture in all those things which concern either faith or
godliness, yet do those points alter the text.

20 This being the confessed integrity of the Hebrew Bible, it can be no
question whether the Protestants translations, professedly following that
Hebrew original, are like to be more perfect then is the Romish vulgar Latin
translation, which their Sacrosancta Synodus -- statuit vt haec ipsa vetus and
vulgata Editio, quae longo tot seculoru^ vs^ in ipsa Ecclesia probata est --
pro authentica habeatur. Conc. Trid. Sess. 4.
Council of Trent has decreed to be authentical, and none but it; especially
seeing that it is confessed first by their own Senensis, that Etiam Sanctes
Pagninus, Praedicatorij Ordinis concionator Apostolicus, vir in diuinis
Scripturis apprime eruditus, -- sed Hebraeae potissimum peritissimus, cum
animaduertisset celebrem illam Hieronymi versionem temporum iniuria, and
hominum incuria vel magna ex part intercidisse, vel magna ex part fuisse
corruptam, -- Leone decimo Pont. hortante, collatis inter se probatissimis
Hebraeorum exemplaribus, quanta valuit fide and industria omne vetus
Testamentum ex Hebraica veritate latinitate donauit. -- Quam Editionem
peritissimi Rabbini omnibus, quae nunc extant, Translationibus praeferunt.
Sixtus Senensis Bibl. lib. 4. Tit. Sanctes Pagninus. page 101.
Sanctes Pagninus, a Preacher of the Order of the Predicants, and a man most
skillful in the Hebrew tongue, when he had perceived the corruptions of the old
vulgar translation, did by the Council of Pope Leo the tenth, consult with the
best Hebrew copies, and then turned them into a Latin translation, which the
Jewish Rabbis prefer before any now extant.

21 Secondly, even Galatinus himself bears witness, that In quibus
(speaking of the Scriptures in Hebrew) long planius longeque perfectius apud
Hebraeos, quam in nostra sieve Latina, sieve Graeca editione fulget Christiana
veritas. Quocirca me a multis carptum iri haudquaquam dubito; and ab his
praesertim qui quicquid ipsi non fecerint, arguere solent, and omnia
vituperant, quae ignorant. Galatinus Praef ante opus de Arcanis fid.
the Hebrew Scripture is much more perfect then is the Latin. This he made
bold to affirm, albeit he knew that some (they be his own words) would carpe
at him and reprove him. Which may be proved (to pass over multitudes of
particular examples in this kind,) by their Cardinal: Argumentum quartum est:
Si Iudaei falsare voluissent diuinas Scripturas in odium Christianorum, sine
dubio praecipua vaticinia sustulissent: id autem minime fecerunt, siquidem ea,
in quibus discrepant Hebraea a Graecis and Latinis, saepe nullius sunt momenti,
quantum attinet ad fidem and religionem: and saepe codices Hebraei magis
Iudaeos vexant, quim Graeci aut Latini.
This may be an argument (says he) that the Jews would not deprave the
Scriptures in hatred of Christians, for then would they have razed out the
chiefest places and prophecies of Christ, but oftentimes we find that the
Hebrew texts do more trouble the (unbelieving) Jews, then do either the Greek
(Septuagints) or the vulger Latin translations. As for example: Certe in Psalm.
2. Latini and Graeci habent [Apprehendite disciplinam, ne irascatur Dominus:]
ex quo nihil aperte contra Iudaeos deduci potest. At in Hebraeo [Osculamini
filium ne irascatur] -- qui locus est inuictissimus contra Iudaeos. --
In the second Psalm where the Latin has [Receiue discipline, lest the Lord
be angrie] out of the Latin there arises no evident argument fit to confute
the Jews, but the Hebrew text is inuincibly strong against them. The second
place is Item Esa. 53. Vbi nos habemus [Et nos putauimus eum quasi -- percussum
a Deo,] in Hebraeo legi potest [Perc^ssum Deum.] Quod certe magnum Iudaeis
facessit negotium, qui Christum futurum esse Deum non credunt. Bellar. lib. 2.
de verbo Dei, cap. 2.. Argum quartum.
Esa. 51. where the Latin has it, [And we thought him to be beaten of God:]
but in the Hebrew thus, [And we thought him to be beaten and humbled God.]
Which place does greatly trouble and afflict the obstinate Jews.

22 Let now any conscience of man examine and judge first, which professors are
more zealous of truth, in embracing the Oracles of God, whether Protestants,
who do as precisely as they can follow the Hebrew, which has been acknowledged
to be a pure fountain, or the Romanists, who content themselves with the Nemo
illam quouis praetextu reijcere audeat. Conc. Trid. Sess. 4.
Latin vulgar translation: which, as a bemudded stream S. Hieronymus eam
(speaking of the same vulgar translation) confutat, redarguit, damnat. And
proving that S. Hierome was not the author of it, he calls him caput pertinax
and morosum cauillatorem, etc. that held the contrary, Fabe^ Stapulens. Praef.

Jerome did condemn, See above lit. n.

Doctors, even since the Council of Trent, have noted to be faulty, not only
by error of writing or of print, but even by ignorance of the Translator.

23 Thirdly, faith is a spiritual appetite of the soul, and that appetite is
to be thought to be best affected, which does most vehemently thirst after the
waters of comforts by the free use of holy Scriptures in the vulgar tongues of
Christian Churches. This is a Christian liberty which Controuersia est inter
Catholicos and haereticos an oporteat vel expediat diuinarum Scripturarum vsum

forbidden, but is herein contrary unto the wisdom of the Church of God in
the old Testament, wherein Joshua legit omnia ve ba legis coram on ni
multitudine puerorum, mulierum, aduenarum, and vult Chrysostomus vxores cum
viris de eo disputare. Agrippa de vanit. cap. 100.
Joshua (as says their Agrippa) read the words of the law before a multitude of
men, women, and children. Wherein the noble Citizens of Thessalonica stand
commended by the holy Ghost, Act. 17. for examining the truth of S. Paul his
doctrine by Scripture; Erant nobiliores eorum qui sunt Thessalonicae --
mulieres and viri non pauci. Act. 17. 11.] Fecerunt -- scrutando, volumen

Act. 17. ve. 11.
which was no more (says their Jesuit Lo^inus) then Christ had commanded,
saying, Search the Scriptures: that is, (as Chrysostom and Futhymius expound
it,) not only to read it, but also exactly and diligently to discuss it.
Wherein Iudaei filios suos quinquennes ad sacra Biblia adaptabant, and primum
locum in informandis pueris, sacris literis, vnde auspicabantur, tribuebant:
quod ex prisca consuetudine, Iudaeos, Eusebius ad sua tempora scruasse scribit.
Pudeat igitur Christianos ab hac cura alicuos esse; neque enim haec mea, aut
noua, sed est patrum antiquorum qu^rimonia Espencaeus Episcopus in 2. Tim 3. in
haec verba, [Et quia ab ins^ntia literas nosti.] page 116.
the Jews (as testifies Bishop Espencaeus) did use to have their children
instructed from five years old; a custom continued among the Jews a long
time, according to the testimony of Eusebius: so that many Christians may be
ashamed of their negligence; which is not only my complaint (says he) but also
of the ancient Fathers. Neither is it denied but that the Jews even yet Vidi

do exercise themselves in the histories and prophecies of holy Scriptures.

24 Lastly, faith as it requires a sincerity in the Principles of truth, so
does it also seek whether the sufficiency of the^ do consist in the written
word, or in the unwritten Traditions. The Sea above lib. 2. c. 25.
Romanists have professed both to be alike divine Oracles, and of equal
authority: the Sea above, ib.
Protestants have defended the sufficiency of the holy writ in both
Testaments. We are now only to enquire into the state of the old Testament,
concerning which, Non desunt aliqui Catholici, etc. Bellar. See above, cap. 8..
4.
some Catholics have denied (says Cardinal Bellarmine) that the Jews had
any unwritten Tradition committed unto them. Among others we find their
Cardinal Iansenius directly affirming, that See above ibid.
whatsoever did belong unto religion toward God, and justice toward men, was
delivered in writing unto Gods people under the old Testament. And that this
may be as truly affirmed of the state of Christians under the new Testament, we
have had it both See above lib. 2. c. 25. per totum.
confirmed by Fathers, and See above ib.. 13.
confessed by our learned Adversaries. We hasten unto

Our conclusion, by way of Appeal.
SECT. 4.
25 Herein our Reader is to be entreated, to exercise his faculty in supplying
that by his diligence, which we, by reason of the copiousnesse of more
material points, could not so easily intend; which is, to gather a Synopsis
and brief of those manifold particular doctrines, wherein the Jews (by our
Adversaries confession) are found to stand in a diameter opposition unto the
Romanists: and then determine whether it could be judgment or prejudice, which
moved the Apologists to promise a demonstration of their Romish faith out of
the Jewish profession, in all articles which come directly into their mention.

CHAP. XVII. Concerning the doctrine of the necessity of Miracles in the
different ages of the world: and of the Romish weak pretenses in this point.
THE ROMISH APOLOGISTS.
That true miracles make a strong argument: And that the aforesaid faith
whereunto the English were converted, was confirmed with such Miracles.. 5.

AND like as in those firster times of the Churches infancy, our Savior did
make manif^st the truth of his Apostles doctrine with undoubted Miracles, to
serve as 1. Cor 12. 12
signs of their Apostleship, to that end Marc. 16. 20.
Confirming the word with signs following: So likewise this virtue or power of
Miracles not ceasing, but (as our Adversaries confess,) Whereas our Savior,
Ioh 14. 12. says, He that believes in me, the works that I do, he shall do,
and greater: in the marginall notes of the English Bible, printed 1576. it is
thereupon said. This is referred to the whole body of the Church, in whom this
virtue does s^ine for ever.
shining in the Church for ever, the necessity thereof being one and the same
in all succeeding ages to the conversion of the heathen, who contemning the
Scriptures, are nothing moved with the Miracles thereof mentioned, our Savior
did in like manner confirm our nox faith so then taught by Austen, with like
manifestation of Miracles, not such only as Antichrist or the Devil can by
the power of nature or secondary causes bring to pass, which may be (b) lying
signs against which we are forewarned, but with Miracles exceeding the power
of nature, and done immediately by God: which by the doctrine of learned
Protestants Vrsinus in comment Catech page 21. fine, says: Etsi Ethnicorum
nonnulla mirac^la commemorantur, ac de Antichristo, and pseudoprophetu dictum
est, editur^s esse signa, etc. tamen ea neque numero neque magnitudine paria
sunt miraculis Ecclesiae, etc. primum enim ea muracula quae ^actantur ab host.
bus Ecclesiae, sunt eiusmodi, quae (ordine naturae non mutato) hominum vel
diabolorum fraudibus possunt effici etc. miracula vero quibus Deus Ecclesiam
ornauit, opera sunt praeter aut contra naturae and causarum secundarum ordinen,
ac pro^n le non nisi diuina potentia facta. And the like is also affirmed by
Zanchius in D. Pauli epistolas ad Philippenses, Colost. and Thessal. page 241,
and 242. By Danaeus in ^^agoges Christianae, part 4 page 43. initio, 46. fine,

are evermore true and infali^ble, of which kind though some be sometimes done
(as the Scriptures forewarne Math. 7. 22.
and Daneus Danaeus in ^^agoges Christianae, part 4 page 48. initio. says: Ad

pertinet, quod a^t Christus, Mult^ dicent mihi in die illo, Domine, nonne per

a greater testimony then John.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
PRotestants are here unnecessarily produced to consent unto that which no
Christian will or can deny, viz. that the miracles wrought by our Savior
Christ and his Apostles were the infallible seals of Gods truth. For the
Apologists being now in a controversy, should have applied their wits to the
confirmation of the point controuerted, and not so copiously have prosecuted a
matter, which is without all question: because we are not to dispute of the
miraculous gifts in the Churches infancy, which were for the establishing of
the Gospel, so glorious, that they who attributed them unto Matthew. 12. 31.
Beelzebub, did commmit irremissible sin against the holy Ghost. But our
question is concerning the necessity and infallibility of the use of Miracles
in all aftertimes, and especially in this decrepit age of the Church wherein
we now live, and whereof our Adversaries in the point of Miracles make no small
ostentation. We therefore, (as it is most requisite in all disquisition of
truth) do first set down

The state of the controversy between the Protestants and Romanists.
SECT. 2.
2 In all the Romanists there is defended a perpetual use of Miracles, not
only of all former times (say the Apologists) but also of this present age:
professing furthermore, that Nunc nostram Ecclesiam demonstremus esse veram Dei
Ecclesiam ex miraculis, quae singulis aetatibus habuit plurima and
testatissima. -- Denique hoc nostro seculo. Bellar. lib. 4 de notis Eccles.
cap. 14.. Veniamus nunc. and. Denique. Nullum seculum, nullaque aetas miraculis
caruit. Costerus Ies. Apolog. part. 3. cap. 9. page 555. In Ecclesia Catholica
semper fuerunt. Posseuinus de notis verbi Dei, fol. 31.
the power of working miracles has been perpetually in the Church of Rome, and
is now also an evident note of the truth thereof. Upon which presumption they
proceed to exact of Protestants the testimony of miracles, which Calvin says
(says Cardinal Bellarmine) may not be expected of them, inasmuch as they
profess the same doctrine of the Apostles, which in the beginning was
sufficiently confirmed by Apostolical miracles. Thus their Cardinal has
acknowledged the true state of this controversy. Now what is the truth in this
contradiction, may be euinced both by the testimonies of antiquity, and clear
confessions of our learned Adversaries. First from antiquity we show, b
Caluinus respondit -- nos illis iniuriam facere, quod miracula ab illis
exigimus, cum ipsi doctrinam antiquam and innumeris miraculis ab Apostolis and
Martyribus confirmatam praedicent. Bellar. lib. 4. de notis Eccles. cap. 14..
Respondet. Caluiniani nullis se miraculis a Deo Missos docent. Maldon. Ies.
com. in Ioh. 2. 18. Catechumenus miraculum expectabit a Caluinista, quod vel
ipse praestet, vel patratum a suis veraci historia confirmet: hoc vnum
postulatum illi os obstruet; cum enim omnia lustrauerit, non possit ob oculos
sistere vel vnum canem, cuius fracta tibia Caluinistae alicuius precibus
hucusque fuerit restituta. Westonus Anglus, Professor Duaci, lib. de triplici
hominis officio, c. 25.


That confidence in Miracles in this later age of the world, is prejudicial
unto the Christian faith: proved by the testimonies of ancient Fathers.
SECT. 3.
3 Numquidnam fratres mei, quia ista signa non ^acitis, minime creditis? ^ed
haec necessaria in exordio Ecclesiae fuerunt. Vt enim ad fidem cresceret
multitudo credentiu^, miraculis fuerat nutrienda: quia and nos, cum arbusta

We use to water young plants (says S. Gregory) when they be new set, which

necessary for the first seed-plot of the Church, to the sound rooting of
multitudes in the faith. Which made S. Hierome to take exceptions unto the
heretics even of his time, who vanted of their Obseruandum est etiam quod
virtutes dicuntur operari in his, qui non tenent ^uangelij veritatem, sicut in
illis, qui Dominum non sequentes, in nomine eius signa faciebant (Marc. 9.) Hoc
aduersus haereticos, qui probationem sidei suae ex eo, si signum aliquod
secerint, arbit^antur. Hieronym* in epist. ad Galat cap. 3. tom. 9.
Miracles; Not considering (says he) that this power may be permitted unto
them, who profess not the truth of the Gospel.

4 Which was partly the reply of S. Augustine against the Donatists and
others; saying moreover of his own time, that Quod dixi, nec miracula illa in
nostra tempora durare permissa sunt, ne anima semper visibilia quaereret, and
eorum consuetudine frigesceret genus humanum, quorum nouitate flagrauit, verum
est quidem: non enim nunc vsque cum manus imponitur baptizatis, sic accipiunt
Spiritum sanctum, vt loquantur linguis omnium gentium; aut nunc vsque ad vmbram
transcuntium praedicatorum Christi sanantur infirmi and si qua talia tunc facta
sunt, quae post a cessasse manifestum est. Sed non sic accipiendum est quod
dixi* vt nunc in Christinomine miracula nulla credantur. August tom. 1.
Retract. lib. 1. c. 13.
some miracles are not suffered now to be wrought, lest that the soul of man
should believe by the eye; these being the times wherein Nemo itaque dicat,
ista modo non facere (miracula) Dominum, and propter hoc praesentibus Ecclesiae
temporibus priora praeponere. Quodam quippe loco ipse Dominus videntibus and
ideo credentibus (Ioh. 20.) praeponit cos qui non vident and credunt. August.

those must be preferred, who (John. 20.) believe and see not: Quisquis adhuc
prodigia, vt credat, inquirit, magnum est ipse prodigiu^. Aug. lib. 22. de

when whosoever shall desire wonders, he shall make himself a wonder and a
monster. Noting, lastly, that therefore Contra istos mirabiliarios cautum me
fecit Deus meus dicens, (Marc. 13) In nouissimis temporibus exurgent
pseudoprophetae, qui signa facient, -- Ecce praedixi vobis. Ergo cautos nos
fecit sponsus, quia non debemus miraculis decipi. August. tom. 9. tract. 13. in
Ioh. cap. 3.
Christ gave us warning of these workers of maruels (when Mark. 13. he taught
us that such false Prophets and workers of signs should come) to take heed
that we be not deceived.

fa^laciam muniendam corruptae praedicationis. Tertull praescript. ad finem.
As though it were not written against heretics, pretending the power of
Miracles (says Tertullian,) that such workers shall come for the corrupting of
the truth? like as it is of salfe Prophets, Iterum praemonet Christus and
instruit, ne quis a pseudoprophetis and pseudochristis in nomine suo facile
fallatur: Multi, inquit, venient in nomine meo, dicentes, Ego sum Christus, and
multos fallent: and postea addidit, dicens, Vos autem cauete, ecce praedixi

deceiving many (says S. Cyprian:) wherefore Christ has given us a caveat to
take heed, and not to admit of all things done in the name of Christ, but such
only as are done in the truth of Christ. And to use the remedy given by
Christ, which is remembered by Theodoret, viz. Instruimur non credere, quando,
qui talia edit, contraria pretati docet. Theod in Deuteronomy.
not to believe them, who work Miracles, and teach ungodliness. Wherefore we
need not fear with S. Chrysostom to conclude, that Dicit Chrysostomus: Non

potius vtilius esse asserit signis nunc carere, quoniam maioris meriti sit.

under his name: for in former times (says he) true Christians were discerned
by Miracles, but now are they known only by Scriptures.

6 This difference of times, by these Fathers thus rightly observed, yields
(if in their days, much more in these, inclining to the last period of times)
this prerogative to Christians, to be directed in the truth by the eye of
faith, and not by the eye of sense: so much the more, because in the latter
times the profession of Miracles shall be (as it is prophesied of them) matter
of delusion, and therefore not to be expected of Christians, but suspected.
This is the common doctrine of Protestants, whereof our Adversaries shall have
less cause to doubt, when they shall further understand,

That the same doctrine, against the perpetual necessity of Miracles of
latter times, is confirmed by the direct confession of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
7 The general doctrine of the now Romish Church is, as we find it in
Cardinal Bellarmine and others, to profess the Bellarm. lib. 4. de notis
Eccles. cap. 14. initio, and cap. 2. Costerus Enchirid. Campian. Rat. Greg. de
Valentia Analys.
power of Miracles, to be a perpetual visible note of the true Church:
thereupon Bellar. quo supra.
reproving Protestants for holding that in the last times the security of our
faith must consist in the knowledge of Scriptures, which have forewarned us
concerning the latter ages, that the opinion of Miracles shall be but an
occasion of seduction.

8 Which we (notwithstanding the The Apologists have pried into a marginall
note of the English Bible, printed Anno 1576. (in which year was the first
impression of that newer editio^) although the older English Bible printed both
before, and about the same year has no such annotation: which has been thus
expounded in the after editions, and namely in that of Anno 1601. viz. The
approving of the virtue of Christ is not included within his own person, but
is spread through the body of his whole Church. This point of the perpetuity
of the use of miracles for confirmation of the faith, being the maine point of
difference, ought to have been confirmed by the Apologists with better proof
then one only obscure note, which they knew was afterward by an explanation
corr^cted.
Apologists objection) do know to be the general and secure defense of Signa

notis Eccles. cap. 14.
Protestants, and now shall corroborate and establish the truth thereof by the
plain suffrages and consent of diverse learned Adversaries: of whom if we make
inquiry whether Miracles be necesrie among Christians, their Bishop Espencaeus
answers, Iam cum nullus sit, infidelis, faciendorum miraculorum nulla est
nunc necessitas. Espencaeus Com. in 2. Tim. 3. page 94 E.
They are not necessary at all, where there are no Infidels. If we ask a
reason hereof, their Jesuit Del'rio does well satisfy, saying: Quod dicit I.
C. pauciorum miraculorum hodie causam esse inconstantiam fidei, and tepore^, ea
quidem vna est, sed melior alia, quia stabilita iam semel fide, minor vel nulla
est necessitas eorum. Del' Rio Ies. disquis. Magic. tom. 2. lib. 4 cap. 4. q.
5. Sect. 2. page 254. E.
Besides the now-inconstancie and weakness of men's faith, which is the cause
that Miracles are now so scarce, the principal reason is, that the faith being
once established, there is either little or no necessity of them at all. And
lest any may think, that therefore the hand of God is now shortened, their
learned Bishop confesses, that in this cause we must be directed by the will
of God, Cum plurimi sunt qui fidem eandem cum priscis fidelibus habeant, qui
miracula non faciunt, non tamen inanis est promissio, quam noluit effectum
habere perpetuum, sed pro tempore nascentis and adolescentis Ecclesiae.
Roffensis Episcopus Captiu. Babyl. contra Luther. cap. 10. part. 4.. Caeterum
vt.
who would not that Miracles should have their perpetual effect, which was
proper only unto the nonage of the Church. Whereunto the judgment of their
Jesuit Acosta does accord, where he diligently observes that Religio
Christiana, vbi humana praesidia prorsus aberant, diuinis est fundata
miraculis: At nostrorum temporum long alia est ratio. -- Quid magnorum
signorum confirmatione est opus? -- vnu^ illud pote^tissimu^ and ad fidem
efficacissimum, ac pene singular miraculum, mores cum fide coniungere. Acosta
Ies. lib. 2 de Indorum salute, cap. 9. page 222, 223.
there is a diverse respect herein to be had between the primitive Church,
when our faith was founded by Miracles, and these our times, wherein there is
no such necessity of them.

9 But we have furthermore affirmed, that the opinion of the use of Miracles is
also dangerous: which is no more then their own learned Preacher has taught
when speaking of the use of Miracles among Christians, whether they be
Catholics or heretics, he says: Dices, nonne rationi consentaneum esset and
conueniens, vt nunc aliq^^ fierent miracula, -- vt magis fides confirmaretur?
Non vtique, nam miracula nobis nunc damnum potius afferrent quam commodum. --
etiamsi in tempore nascentis Ecclesiae fuerint necessaria. Puer enim, quando
ambulare incipit, adiuuatur vehiculo, -- quod homini adulto est impedimento.
Stella in Luc. 11. page 64. Tom. 2.
Now Miracles would not be convenient for confirmation of the faith: for as a
child in his weakness, is by a wheelestoole enabled to walk, the use whereof
would be an hinderance unto him, when be comes to be of a more perfect age; so
in the infancy of the Church Miracles were necessary for the strengthening of
the faith, which in these days would be but inconvenient. This danger will be
more sensible unto us, when we shall have proved our next Assertion, viz.

That the Protestants doctrine of not believing the Miracles of the latter
times, is a requisite doctrine of belief: and is proved by the public
confessions of our learned Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
10 No man exercised in the word of truth, can be ignorant how it is prophesied
of the latter times, that the profession of Miracles shall be the principal
means of apostasy from the truth: our Savior plainly prefining, that Matthew.
24. 24.
in the latter times false Prophets shall arise, working great signs and
wonders, able to deceive, if it were possible, even the very elect: when as
Antichrist 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9.
the man of sin shall come, whose coming shall be by the effectual working
of Satan with all power and signs, and lying wonders: with deceiueablenesse
of unrighteousness among them that perish, because they received not the love
of the truth, that they might be saved: therefore God shall send them strong
delusions to believe lies. In the which so terrible a storm, our safest manner
of belief will be (as we have learned by Christ's words) Matthew. 24.
not to believe them: which is the constant profession of M. Non est miraculis
fidendum quae fieri aut mentiuntur, aut vere praedicant, sed soli doctrinae
Christi and Apostolorum. Apostoli enim signa ediderunt tantum ad Euangelij
praedicationem; postqua^ vero late propagatum est Euangelium, and in vniuerso
mu^do promulgatum, non est opus porro miracula facere. Luther Dom. 2. Aduent.
ex ep. ad Romans 15. in haec verba, [Vnanimes. etc.
Luther.

11 Contrary hereunto is the general doctrine of the Romish Church, defending
(as we have heard) See above Sect. 2.
the use of Miracles to be a perpetual note and character of the Church:
notwithstanding it be certain (even in the acknowledgement of learned Jesuits)
first, that the Miracles in the days of Antichrist shall be so great, that
thefalse shall hardly be discerned from true: then, that Hu^usmodi Magorum signa
facientium, exemplo, voluit Deus fideles suos admonitos esse and cautos, ne
turbarentur aut scandalizentur signis and prodigijs impiorum hominum, quasi
illa essent miracula and diuinae virtutis testimonia. Hinc enim aperte
cognoscitur, multa videri miracula, quae non sunt, and proprium esse Diaboli
transfigurare se in Angelum lucis, and ad circumueniendos mortales simulare
prophetiam, and miracula, and alia, quae sunt dona Dei supernaturalia. Pereri^^
Ies. com in Exodus 7. disp. 11. page 404.
we are admonished not to be scandalized by them, because such is the subtelty
and power of Satan, that he can transfigure himself as it were into an Angel
of light. Nay their b Difficile erit (speaking of the days of Antichrist)
discerenere vera signa a falsis, vbi multa and magna erunt veris ipsis omnino
simillima. Acosta Ies. lib. 2. de temp. nouiss. cap. 19. fine.
Jesuit Salmeron says more, viz. that Etsi vera sunt miracula (Antichrists)
dicuntur tamen mendacia, quia falsum erit id, ad quod persu^dendum inducuntur:
sicut falsum conficitur argumentum in Dialectica, quod interdum constat ex
veris propositionibus. Salmeron Ies. com. in 2. Thessal. 2. disp. 3.. Addit
Paulus.
though the Miracles of Antichrist be supposed most true for their action, yet
(he aiming at a confirmation of errors) they are most false in the intention,
even as it is in Sophistry, which from true premises does infer a false
conclusion.

12 Lastly, in these so great creeks of error, when we enquire where is most
safest harbor, their Jesuit Acosta confesses, that Monet Christus, Ecce
praedixi vobis (Matthew. 24.) Et, Dabunt pseudochristi signa, quibus in errotem
introducantur, si fieri possit, Electi.] Huic ergo tam horribili procellae
opponitur rupes fortissma verbi Dei. Quocirca videte diligenter quanta sint
Scripturae diuinae praesidia, quae omnem miraculorum vim superant; nihil est
enim verbi diuini authoritate robustius, etc. Acosta Ies. Conc. 1. Donun. 24.
post Pentecost. page 6.
our strongest hold will be the holy Scriptures, which are of more strength
then any Miracles: and that Omnino nulla alia res aduersus omnes Antichristi
praestigias, and truculentissimam tyrannide^ athletas Christi perinde armabit,
atque coelestis doctrinae inuictissima authoritas. Merito autem vbi suprema
omnium est futura tentaio, vberiora and praeclariora diuinarum Scripturarum

CHAP. XVIII. Concerning the examples of Romish Miracles of later times
objected by the Apologists: and first of the Jesuit Xauerius among the Indians.
THE ROMISH APOLOGISTS.
And hence it is that the credible histories as well of all former times, as
also of this In the book entitled A report of the kingdom of Congo a region
of Afric, printed 1597. published by M. Abraham Hartwel, servant to the Lord
Archbishop of Cante^bury, and by him dedicated to his Lo. mention is made l. 1.
c. 1. initio, of the discovery of that kingdom Anno 1587. by ^d^ardo Lopes:
and of the conversion thereof to the Christian faith, l. 2. c 2. and of the
great and undoubted miracles showed by God in the presence of a whole arntie,
l. 2. c. 3. insomuch that M. Abraham Hartwell in his Epistle there to the
Reader, post medium, confesses, that this conversion of Congo was accomplished
by Massing Priests, and after the Romish manner. And this acti^^ (says he)
which tends to the glory of God, shall it be concealed, and not committed to
memory, because it was performed by Popish Priests, and Popish means? God
forbid. In like manner M. Ioho Porie, lately of Goneuill and Calus College in
Cambridge, in the Geographicall history of Africa, by him published Anno 1600
page 410, versus finem, acknowledges and mentions the said miracles: and
page 413. initio, he commends M. Hartwell for publishing his foresaid
treatise. Al^o whereas it appears in the book entitled, Retum in orient
gestarum Commentarius, fol. 2 that Francis Xaueriu^ set forward in his journey
from Lisbone to the East India, Anno 1541 to the conversion of those nations:
and page 36. that the King of Portugal hearing of the great miracles as then
there wrought, sent forth his commission to his Viceroy there, dated in
April, 1556. to take examination thereof upon oath: upon execution whereof,
and certificate thereupon being accordingly made, it did appear (fol. 8. b)
that Xauerius in testimony and proof of the Christian faith by him then
preached and taught, cured miraculcusly the dumb, the lame, the deaf, and with
his word healed the sick: (and fol. 9. a.) raised sundry dead persons to life:
and after his death, which happened (fol 14. 2.) Anno 1552. the grave being
opened, wherein his dead body for a time had lain buried, to the end his naked
bones might be carried from thence to Goa (fol. 14. b.) they found his body not
only unconsumed, but also yielding forth fragra^tsmels: from whence they
carried it to Goa, and placed it there in the Church of S. Paul, where yet to
this day (says the conmentary) it remains free from corruption: Witness
whereof, says that treatise, are all the inhabitants of that city, and
travelers that repair thither, and the truth hereof for matter of fact is so
probable, that M. Whitaker lib. de Ecclesia contra Bellarminum, page 353. dare
not in his answer thereto altogether rest in denial of the fact, but says: Ne
putet (Bellarminus) me omnino hec miracula contemnere: respondeo sieri posse,
vt in regno Pontificio fuerint huiusmodi miracula, and nunc sint. And page 354.
post medium, he says, Petuit Diabolus Xauerij corpus ad tempus seruare
incorruptum and suauiter olens: and he not so much denies those miracles, as
ouerboldly refers them to the devils work: whereas yet to the contrary M.
Richard Hackluit Preacher, in his book of the principal nauigations etc
printed 1599. in the 2. part of the 2. volume, page 88. initio, doubts not to
afford commendable mention of that holy man Xauerus, his particular virtues
and wonderful works in that region.
present age, are plentiful in like examples of true and undoubted Miracles
showed by God, at the conversion of heathen Nations. Among which our Countries
foresaid conversion by Austen holds not the least place, as being in like
manner greatly then confirmed with undoubted Miracles, not lately feined, but
so credibly testified by the lawful wri^ers of those times, that now sithence
they are acknowledged for certain and true by learned Protestants themselves.
To this end does S. Bid and our own Chronicles witness, how that Austen Beda

are come to us both of his health and of his work that he has in hand: and
surely either he or they which were sent over with him, work so many miracles

true Miracles.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
FOR their better evidence of the power of Miracles in their Church, they are
glad to travel as far as India, enlarging their margent with the testimonies
of two Protestant writers, who have published and acknowledged (as they say)
the manifold wonders wrought among the infidels in India by the Jesuit
Xauerius: whom their Cardinal Bellarmine magnified Hoc nostro seculo --
constat a Francisco Xauerio paralyticos, surdos, mutos, coecos esse curatos,
mortuum quoque ad vita^ reuocatum. Bellar. l. 4. do notis Eccles. cap. 14.
Denique.
for healing the deaf, dumb, lame, blind, yea and raising one dead.

2 But our authors, when as only by translation of a Romish An history drawn
out of the writings and discourses of Odoardo Lopoz a Portugal, by Philippo
Papigetta a Portugal. M. Hartwell in the preface to the book.
history of the kingdom of Congo, they relate such things, by approving that
they hear or read, do not avouch so much judgment as credulity; for The
Emperor Adrian used to say, Testibu^ magis quam testimonijs credo.
Auritus audita loquitur: therefore when the Apologists do cite our relations
of their stories, they do but, in effect, call only their own Authors to
witness.

3 Notwithstanding if we shall consult with their own men, we shall not find
so firm ground of crediting such reports: first, because their own learned
Professor Franciscus de Victoria, discussing that question of Miracles among
the Indians in the days of Xauerius, could not be so persuaded of their
Miracula and signa nulla audio, nec exempla vitae adeo religio a -- vt
teneantur (Ind^) Religioni Christianae acquiescere. ^ran^is^us de (...)
Professor Regius in Academ. a Salmanticensi Hispaniae, Relect. 5. Sect. 2. page

sufficiency, as to think that the Indians were thereby convicted or bound to
yield assent to the Christian faith. Secondly, Xauerius himself writ many
books of epistles out of India, concerning his proceedings in the cause of
religion, whereof he directed some to Ignatius Loyola the Father of the
society of Jesuits, and others to other of his familiars, not sparing upon
occasion to report a wonder of In hac insula Amboino rem vidi incredibilem, and
ante hoc tempus inauditam -- caprum lacte suo haedos alentem paruos. -- Ego
ipse rem perspexi his oculis, neque enim aliter. vt crederem, adduci potuissem.
Xauerius Ies. lib. 2. de rebus Indicis, epist. 3. page 97.
nature, and yet does not make any mention of healing the deaf, dumb, lame,
dead, or of any work of his, which could truly deserve the name of a
miraculous power of grace. Thirdly, albeit we are very inclinable to believe
that for the conversion of infidels unto the faith, God might and did vouchsafe
to make visible unto them those Act. 2. 11.
magnalia Dei; notwithstanding (besides that we learned already, that the
common date of Miracles is long since expired,) their own learned Jesuit
Acosta (who lately in the West Indies labored as abundantly as any other for
the conversion of Paganes unto Christ,) does confess saying, Quae est
praedicatio nostra? quae siducia? signa certe non edimus. Acosta Ies. lib. 4.
de Indorum salute, cap. 4. page 365. Prodigia nulla producimus, neque vero est
opus. Ibid cap. 12. page 397. and alibi passim.
We work no wonders, we effect no miraculous work, neither (says he) is this
necessary.

4 Which is not therefore produced by us to the prejudice of the power of Gods
grace (far be that height of blasphemy from us!) but that we may understand
the truth of Gods proceedings, who has neither need of Miracles for the
conversion of infidels, nor of lies for confirmation of his faithful.

5 We may be furthermore informed herein by the same Jesuit Acosta, who
discussing Multos inter haec quaerere illud and admi^ari non temere solete
animaduerti, quid sit quod nostra aetate in praedicatione Euangelij apud nouas
gentes, miraculorum illa vis non cernatur, quam Christus suis promisit, quaeque
ad confirmanda super-humana dogmata singulariter efficax est. -- Argumento est
mirabilis illa and inaudita peregrinatio in terra Florida, vbi -- quatuor illi
homines militares atque profani, diuinitus gratia sanationum donati, opera
Apostolica perpetrantes, -- propter sanitatum operationes, vitaeque innocentiam
tantum gloriae and admirationis inter barbaros consequuti sunt, vt propemodum
pro dijs adorarentur. -- Cur ergo putamus excelsi dertram se continere, neque,
quod potest, gratia miraculorum tot populos ad sidem trahere? -- Legimus in
historijs Anglorum quot and quam magna per Augustinum, and Iustum, and Mellitum
miracula Christus ediderit: -- cur ergo nostra tempora deserta sunt, quibus
tanta orbis portio innotuit, vt cum ea Anglia vniuersa, si conseratur, vix
domus exigua ad ingentem v^bem sutura sit? Multos, vt dixi, ad hunc modum secum
cogitantes, pia haec neque indocta quaestio tenet.
the question which many make, why in this age in the conversion of the Indians
there appears not the power of Miracles, as well as it did in Terra florida,
where four men, and by profession soldiers, having the miraculous gift of
healing, and leading a sanctified life, were so admired of the Barbarians, that
they were almost honored for Gods; and why shall God now withdraw his
omnipotent hand, which he extended upon the English in their conversion, seeing
that all England is scarce to be accounted one house to a great city, if it be
compared with that part of the world, which has been lately discovered?

6 He answers first out of S. Augustine, that Mihi vero illud Augustini
opportune occurrit, qui cum commemorasset paulo ante diuinam vocationem
interdum externis signis, aliquando interno pulsu fieri; mox adiungit: Haec
autem vocatio quae sieve in singulis hominibus, sieve in populis, atque in ipso
genere humano per temporum oportunitates operatur, altae and prosundae
operationis est. -- Cui rei non dissimile mihi videtur, quod Ecclesiam suam
olim in ipsis Euangelij cunabulis, multorum signorum and variorum charismatum
copia congregauerit, eandem modo de Gentibus non minus mirab^liter mirabilium
parcitate colligit; diuersa tempora secundum diuersas suas leges sapientiae
diuersis rationibus administrans. --
God conuerteth men sometimes by outward signs, and sometimes by inward
inspirations; but when, and whom he will convert by either of these means,
stands in the unsearchable wisdom of Gods ordinance: who, when the Church
was but in the cradle, did call men by mighty Miracles to the faith of the
Gospel, and now does no less maruellously convert men without multitudes of
Miracles, governing diverse times by the diverse laws of his wisdom.

7 Secondly, he gives a reason of this difference: Mihi quidem aliquoties ista
animo repetenti, tam perspicuae diuersitatis in potestate signorum, illa
occurrere causa solet, quod priscis temporibus omnino necessaria fuerint,
nostris non item. Etenim sides mysteriorum sublimium omnem humanam rationem
superantium, astruenda tunc erat apud homines maxim ratione sua cuncta
metientes, and ad solitos calculos reuocantes, Graecos, inquam, atque Romanos,
caeterosque illa aetate sapientia huius seculi florentes. His quomodo per
homines paucos, ignobiles and illiteratos persuaderi possit, -- nisi diuina
quaedam atque incluctabilis euicisset autoritas, contestante Deo signis and
prod^gijs, and varijs charismatibus? quod etiam Paulus Apostolus saepe
commendat 1. Cor. 2. Sermo meus, inquit, non erat in persuasibilibus humanae
sapientiae verbis, sed in ostentatione spiritus and virtutis, vt fides vest^a
non sit in sapientia hominum, sed in virtute Dei. -- Ita Christiana religio,
vbi humana praesidia prorsus aberant, diuinis est fundata miraculis. At
nostrorum temporum alia est ratio, nam and ij, quibus fides annunciatur,
omnibus rebus inferiores sunt, ratione, cultu, authoritate; and ij qui
annunciant, antiquitate religionis suae, multitudine suorum, ingenio,
elegantia, caeterisque; copijs ad persuadendum superiores sunt and abundant. --
When Grecians and Romans (says he,) men learned in all humane wisdom, and
who stood upon the terms of natural reason, were to be brought unto Christ,
it seemed unto almighty God a thing convenient, that the conuerters, being but
simple and unlearned men, should be furnished with divine power of working
Miracles, which exceeded all natural means, as S. Paul signifies in
himself. But there is not the like reason of such wondrous works now among
these people, who are every way inferior unto their conuerters, in wit,
judgment, and all natural endowments, and whatsoever other outward faculty,
which may auatle for persuasion. And therefore in conclusion, he wishes in
Christian conuerters but Denique quid magnorum signorum confirmatione opus est,
vbi potius desideratur acutior intelligentia, quae altitudinem nost^ae
doctrinae aliqua curiositate disquireret? Vnum illud de gentibus huic nouo orbi
potentissimum, and ad ^idem efficacissimum, and pene singular miraculum
necessarium est, mores cum side congruentes: hoc and abunde sufficit, and
omnibus concessum est, modo velint. Hactenus Josephus Acosta Ies. lib. 2. de
salute Iudorum. cap 9.
conformity of a godly life with their Christian faith; which (says he) would
be of it self, indeed, a most singular Miracle, most powerful and succesfull
for the converting of infidels unto the faith.

8 If this be so in those parts of India, wherein this their Acosta has been
so long conversant, we see no reason there should be so great difference of the
other parts of India before mentioned. For as it is forbidden in Scripture to
say, that 3. Reg 20. 28.
God is the God of the valleys, and not of the mountains: so may it seem
inconsonant for men, to attribute so much power of miraculous grace unto the
East, and so little to the West. And although the experience of Gods working
must confound all reasoning of man, yet seeing the credit which man has
thereunto, does depend upon the fidelity of man the reporter, it is requisite
that every such report contain it self within the compass of due
intelligence.

9 Howsoever, this argument of Miracles wrought among infidels does not infer
an undoubted difference of Christian professors amongst themselves, both
because Chrysostomus, Hieronymus, Euthymius and Theophylactus probant multis
exemplis, etiam per homines insideles vera miracula facta esse. -- Et ex hoc
loco (Matthew. 7. 22) facile colligitur, falsos istos prophetas, de quibus
Christus loquitur, vera miracula facturos, vere prophetasse, vere Daemonia
eiecisse: nec enim respondit Christus mentiri eos; sed, quamuis ita fecerint,
se eos non nosse. Maldonat. Ies. c^m. in Matthew. 7. 22.
the gift of working Miracles (as both Fathers, and their own Jesuit
Maldonate do resolve) is no necessary argument of the true Church, except it be
ordinary: and also because God does grant this gift of Miracles (as is
observed by their Jesuit Si obijcias a malis quoque and perperam de fide
sentientibus nonnunquam miracula edita fuisse, and ideo miracula non debere
censeri efficacem fidei probationem: Occurram solere Deum aliquando h^nc
gratiam gratuito etiam talibus largiri, sed id in verae fidei probationem, vt
quando dedit prophetiam Balaamo and Ca^phae: in falsae fidei confirmationem nec
dedisse vnquam nec dare posse. Non magis enim mendacij confirmationem potest
Deus miraculis comprobare, quam potest ipsa veritas mentiri. Del'rio Iesuita
Disquit. Magic lib. 2. qu. 7. tom. 1.
Del'rio, and their Cardinal Ad miraculum Nouatiani respondeo, Miraculum
factum esse non in confirmationem fidei Nouatiani, sed Catholici baptismi: id
enim pro miraculo scribit Socrates, quod cum ad Paulum Episcopum Nou^tianum
venis^et quidam ludaeus impostor, vt ab eo baptizaretur, and apud se baptismum
irrideret, continuo tota sacri fontis aqua euanuit. Bellar. lib. 4. de notis
Eccles. cap. 14. ad finem.
Bellarmine) unto the false professors, but yet for the confirmation of that
part of the true faith which they profess, as appears in the examples of
Balaam, Caiphas, and a Nouatian Bishop; or as he in the name of Christ, who
notwithstanding was no true disciple or follower of Christ.

10 We shall need no more for this present point in question, for
understanding, that among them who profess the same faith of Christ (albeit
not with equal truth and sincerity) the less sincere parties may work
Miracles, whereunto God concurreth by his omnipotent power; but not for proof
of the errors, which are proper unto themselves, but for the confirmation of
the truth, which with them is common to the Church.

11 Therefore in Miracles, which the Apologists have objected, we disstinguish
between the Apostolical truth, which they with us do profess, and their
intermixed adherent corruptions: and may grant, that God does cooperate by them
to the conversion of infidels, so far as the Gospel of Christ, which is the
Romans 1. 16.
power of God to salvation, is preached by them: and not for the approbation of
the leaven of their other superstitions. Hitherto then there can be no
advantage gained by their pretense of Miracles, wherein

THE ROMISH APOLOGISTS do further instance, in the times of S. Bernard.
Hereunto we could likewise add the undoubted, many and great Miracles As
concerning the miracles of Malachias: to omit particular mention of them, no
meaner a witness then S. Bernard, who lived in the same time with him, and was
to him so familiarly known, says of them in general, in vita Malachiae: In
what kind of old miracles did not Malachias excel? He wanted not prophecy,
nor revelation, nor the gift of healing, and to conclude, not raising of the
dead. And no less undoubted miracles are written of S. Bernard by his own
scholar God^ridus, and others of that time, who writ his life. Godfridus (de
vita Sancti Bernardi* lib. 3. cap. 5.) mentioning an undoubted known miracle,
wrought by him in Toulouse, in confirming of h^s doctrine against the heretics
called Apostolici, who (as appears hereafter tract. 2. cap. 2. sect. 3. in
the margent under the letter^n) denied the Real Presence, Mass, Purgatory,
etc. Of which said miracle S. Bernard himself in his 241 epistle (which was
written to the same persons) gives a modest signification in like words, as
does S. Paul, 1. Thessal. 1. 5. The many miracles of S. Bernard are so credibly
and certainly reported, that Osiander in Centur. 12. page 310. post med dare
not ^est in denial of them, but says of them: Partim permissione Dei,
praestigijs Satanicis effecta existimo, non quod S. Bernardum magn^^ fuisse
putem, sed quod verisimile sit Satanam talia miracula effecisse, etc. ad
confirmationem idololatriae and falsorum cult^^^* so good a Protestant he
makes S. Bernard.
wrought of later times, (to omit sundry others) by holy Malachias, and S.
Bernard, both of them confessed, and known As concerning Malachias his
religion: Osiander Centur. 12. page 315. post med. ^aith: Malachias
Archiepiscopus in Hibernia, ab ineunte aetate literis and religioni addictus,
tandem inuitus and diu admodum coactus Archiepiscopatum Hiberniae assumpsit. S.
Bernardo admodum familiaris fuit, eius monachatum admiratu^ and i^itatus est,
superstitiones Pontificias amplexus, Romanum Pontificem pro Deo coluit,
tribuuntur illi admodum plurima miraculae etc. (and vide ibidem page 256 post
medium.) And S. Bernard in vita Malachiae, affirms that Malachias was Legate
to the Pope. As concerning S. Bernards religion, of whom M. Whitaker (in
praelect. de Ecclesia contra Bellarminum, page 369. paulo post medium) says:
Bernardum vere sanctum fuisse existim^. He was Abbot of Claireuaux (as
testifies Simeon de Voyo^ upon the Catalog. etc page 126.) and he acknowledged
so plainly the Popes primacie (whereof see S. Bernard l. 2 de consider. ad
Eugenium, and l. 3. c 8. and epist. 125. and 131. and 190. ad Innocentium) that
he is therefore reproved by D. Fulke against the Rhemish Testament, in Luc. 22.
sect. 11. fol. 133 b. post initium, and by M. Whitaker, lib. 2. contra Duraeum*
page 154. ante medium: and was so evidently a professed Catholic, that
Gomarus in speculo Ecclesia, page 23. versus finem, alleges him to us,
saying: Bernardus sanctus vester: and M. Whitaker (in respons. ad ratio. Camp.
rat. 7. p. 105. ante med.) says, Bernardus quem Ecclesia vestra multis annis
vnum tulit pium virum, etc. Lastly, this point is yet made further evident in
Malachias and Bernard, in that it is manifest that they both lived anno Domini
1140. when the profession of our now Catholic faith was most flourishing:
which thing M. Jewel in his defense of the Apology, printed 1571. page 557.
paulo ante med. confesses saying, S. Bernard lived in the midst of the Popes
rout and tyranny. Whereupon it follows, that for so much as neither of them is
found to have been troubled for any one point of doctrine disagreeing from
those times, but were to the contrary, both of thhem in high favor as then
with the Roman Sea, the one of them being the Popes Legate, the other an
Abbot, that therefore they were agreeable in religion to the professed doctrine
of those times: so improbably do our adversaries pretend S. Bernard to have
been a member of their Church, for his only then zealous reproving the
corruption of life and manners in the Clergy of that age.
members of our now professed Catholic faith.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
12 The Apologists say in their text, that they could add many great Miracles
wrought of latter times, to omit sundry others wrought by Malachias, and S.
Bernard. And their notes of 2. and 3. directing us unto their intent in the
margent, show that all those great Miracles of latter times are no other then
those which they pretend to omit, even the Miracles attributed unto Malachias
and S. Bernard: which they have so omitted, as that they have occupied a whole
page with their mention; wherein Protestants are brought in to commend their
persons, and Miracles are noted for justification of their whole religion. And
this is the scope of their whole dispute.

13 But if we (instancing in S. Bernard) should but demand of the Apologizers,
whether that by the grace of the gift of Miracle ascribed by them unto S.
Bernard, they could authorize S. Bernards means of interpreting the sacred
Scriptures, which their Jesuit Acosta notes to have been Beatissimus
Bernardus inter fagos se Scripturas didicisse narrat, nullumque alium magistrum
agnoscit, qui profecto facundissimus est Tractator mysteriorum Dei. Acosta Ies.
lib. 2. de Christo Reuelat. cap. 5.
by himself, without any other teacher; or his sentence concerning the state
of the souls of blessed Saints, which See the next book following, cap. 4.
Alphonsus de Castro did note and condemn as an * heresy, or his restraining
of their Churches power of dispensing with a kind of punishment, as though she
Nec Ecclesia potuit poenam illam tollere, mulieris intra tempus luctus
nubentis. Glossa in Decret. Iuris Canon. Tit. 21. de secundis nuptijs, cap. 5.
Hereunto the editio Gregoriana, in margin, says: Imo potuit, quicquid hic
dicat Bernardus: but the Index Expurg. verba deleantur, as witnesses our
Pappus in Indice expurg. page 350. in Collat. Censurae in Glossas Iuris Canon.
could not take it away; and is therefore controlled by their Popes marginall
correction with some disgrace, saying: Say Bernard what he list, the punishment
notwithstanding may be taken away: or his opinion concerning the blessed
Virgin, supposed by their Jesuit Salmeron to be his, and yet condemned not
without disdain, saying: See above lib. 2. cap. 29. Sect. 2. g.
All devotion is not seated in S. Bernard: we might add his judgment
concerning the Romish acception of See above lib. 2. cap. 10.
Free Will, Ibidem, Cap. 11. and alibi.
Merit, and other articles. Whether (we say) our Apologists would allow in S.
Bernard, by the virtue of his Miracles, these and such like his opinions, they
ought to answer; but happily will not, because whether they grant this, or deny
it, they must fall into their own snare. For if the gift of Miracles does
warrant the worker in all his doctrines, then how shall our Adversaries
justify their dissent from him? But if that miraculous power do not patronize
all the religion of the professor, then cannot this be any demonstration of the
truth of all their religion.

14 Howbeit, if, as little dead flies do infect the whole box of the
Apothecaries ointme^t, one few vainereports of a Miracle might prejudice the
rest; there are extant in the supposed reports of S. Bernard, mention of such
kind of Miracles by Sanctus Malchus praeceptor Malachiae surdo auditum
restituit, in quo mi^abile quiddam confessus est, quod cum sanctus vtrique
auriculae hinc inde digitos immisisset, duos quasi porcellos ex ipsis exire
senserit. Another:
Malchus and Malachias facta oratione, tangens digito linguam mutae foeminae,
sputum misit in os eius, and loquentem dimisit. Another: Vir honorabilis venit
ad S. Malachiam, questus de sterilitate animae suae, supplicans vt sibi
obtineret ab omnipotente Deo gratiam lachrymarum: subridens Malachias, quod
gratum haberet in homine seculari desiderium spirituale, suam maxillam maxillae
illius quasi blandiendo coniungens, fiat, inquit tibi sicut petijsti. Another:
In vrbe Eboracensi accessit ad eum Prior in Kirkeham Regularium fratrum, -- and
aduertens Malachiam Episcopum ministros multos habere, equos paucos, -- obtulit
ei suum, quo ipse vehebatur, Hoc solum dolere se* inquiens, quod esset runcinus
(that is a restie jade) dure portans: Lubentius, inquit, dedissem si melior

CHAP. XIX. What little credence is due unto the now pretended Miracles of
Romanists; proved by sufficient arguments: the first is taken from the
confessed raritie, yea and nullitie of Miracles in these times.
SECT. 1.
WE entreat not now of the wonderful manner of protection, which God often
uses for the preservation of his servants, which often exceeds all
expectation or reason of man: but of the Charisma and gift of working Miracles,
which exceeds all possibility of nature: and hereof argue diversely.

2 First, if S. Sicut eo tempore, quo nos errores deseruimus, multa miracula
edita sunt, postea vero cessarunt vera religione iam plantata. Quod si etiam
post haec facta sunt, pauca illa and rara sunt. Chrysostom. tom. 2. hom. 4. in 1.
cap. Matthew. sub initium. Nunc fignorum operatio omnino leuata est, magis apud
eos inuenitur qui falsi sunt Christiani, fieri ficta, etc. Hom. 49. operis
imperf. in Matthew. Vnde ego credere illi (Gentiles) poterint? fortasse ex

manifestum est. A^gust. Retract. lib. 1. cap. 13.
Augustine, who had so near affinity with the primitive and Apostolical age,
said, that some principal Miracles were then altogether ceased: can we think
that now after the continual withering of a thousand years, the Church like
Sarahs barren womb, should revive and bring forth in this twelfth and
thirteenth generation most Bellarm. lib. 4. de not is Eccles. cap. 14.
wonderful Miracles, as they pretend?

3 Secondly, if their Jesuit Del'rio could yield some reasons why there are
Delrius. See above cap. 17.. 4. at the letter, f.
fewer Miracles wrought in this age then in former times, to wit, the greater
inconstancy, and the less necessity: may we admit their mart of Miracles
wrought Loci religionem non vetera (meaning when it was at Nazareth) quam noua
quotidie illustrant miracula* -- Perpetua aedis Lauretanae miracula ita
euidentia sunt, vt -- cuiuis facerent diuinae praesentiae fidem. Tursellinus
Praef. in Historia^ Lauret. and deinceps.
continually (as they say) at Lauretto, with no less glory then in the days
of old?

4 If their Jesuit Acosta doubted not so lately to write concerning the Pagane
and Infidel countries in West India, that Signa nulla facimus, etc. Acosta
Ies. See above c. 18. Sect. 1. lit. f.
there are no Miracles wrought amongst them; is it credible that so many, and
so admirable works should be done among Christians, as our Adversaries boast
of, knowing that Iam cum nullus sit infidelis, faciendorum miraculorum nulla
nunc est necessitas. Espencaeus Episc. com. in 2. Tim. 3. page 94.
signs are for infidels, and not for them that believe? signifying, as their
Bishop Espencaeus witnesses, that Miracles are not necessary, but only among
Infidels?

5 Fourthly, if their Bishop Roffensis, who lived not above fourscore years
ago, even in the days of superstition, in his vehement opposition against
Luther, held it no paradoxe to affirm, saying, Docent Euangelia Christum
eiecisse Daemones, illumin^sse caecos, aegrotos sanasse. Ecce factum: Apostolis
insuper mand^sse quatenus ipsi facerent eadem opera, Luc. 9. -- Aduerte simul
promissionem, viz. factam effectus sequuturi, cunctis qui essent credituri in
Christum: -- quam certe his diebus effectum nullum sortiri dilucide cernimus:
nemo enim est qui iam corporaliter Daemones eijcit, aut sanat morbos, nec tamen
ambigimus qum plurimi sint qui fidem habeant. -- Nec tamen inanis promissio,
quam Christus noluit efficaciam habere perpetuam, sed pro tempore nascentis and
adol^scentis Ecclesiae. Roffensis Episcop. contra Captiu. Babyl. cap. 11. part.
4.
the promise which Christ gave unto his Disciples concerning healing the sick,
giving sight unto the blind, dispossessing of devils, and such like, is not in
such effect in these days, wherein we see no man cast out devils out of men's
bodies, or heal diseases: and shall their new authors deserve any credit, who
make it but an ordinary cure of Images to give strength unto the lame, and
sight unto the blind: and do also talk of Nobilis mulier e Gallia a septem
Daemonibus obsessa liberatur per Stephanum Francigenam Canonicum Auximagnum

2. cap. 7. Alexander Garliadinus campo fuit non ignobilis, is clarissimam

Exorcistarum Ordo insitus est. Salmeron Ies. comment. in 1. Cor. 11. disp. 20..
Octauo dubio.
dispossessing one of four, another of seven, ugly and terrible devils?

6 Fifthly, if the Patriarch Tharasius in the latter Council of Nice (which
defended the worshipping of Images, and was therefore condemned by a Council
at Videtur mihi in Francofurdiensi Concilio vere reprobatam fuisse Nicaenam
secundam. Bellar. lib. 2. de Council. cap. 8.. Videtur.
Frankford) could justly confess in the presence of all the Bishops of that
Council, that Tharasius sanctissimus Patriarcha dixit; Sed quispiam dixerit,
cur miracula a nostris imaginibus non eduntur? Cui sane ita sit ab Apostolo
responsum, Miracula non credentibus data sunt, sed ijs qui in incredulitate
versantur, hi igitur qui imaginem ita tractabant, infideles erant, 1. Cor. 14.
qua de causa signum illis datum est a Deo per imaginem, vt ea ratione ad fidem
nostram Christianam traherentur: and Matthew 12. Generatio adultera quae^it
signum, and signum non dabitur ei. Conc. Nicen. 2. Apud Surium Tom 3. Conc.
Act. 4. page 100. In the margent, Cur hodie imagines non edant miracula.
Miracles are not wrought by Images amongst them who profess the Christian
faith: can it stand with the modesty of our Adversaries, for want of Miracles
wrought personally by men, to betake themselves wholly unto Miracles wrought by
Images: as their Tursellin. hist. de ^de Lauret.
Tursellinus, Lipsius de Virg. Hallens. Aspricoll.
Lipsius, and Costerus Apolog. cap. 9. page 561.
Costerus have done?

7 Sixthly, if their Jesuit Maldonate have well determined, that Necessario
sequitur came, in qua ^requentia and quasi ordinaria miracula fiant, veram esse
Ecclesiam, -- nulli hominum societati, nisi Ecclesiae suae ordinariam
potestatem faciendi miracula concessit. Maldonat. Ies. comm. in Matthew. 7. 22.
in haec verba, Virtutes multas.
the working of Miracles cannot be a necessary argument of a true Church, but
where it is ordinary: how shall their common challenge prevail, whereby they
seek to demonstrate the Roman Church by the gift of Miracles and Prophecy,
as the true notes of a Church professing the saving faith? especially seeing
that their Jesuit Salmeron grants, that Non desunt -- qui gratia polleant
sanationum, etsi non its frequenter, vnde and Reges Galliae and Angliae
peculiari charismate ad sanandum morbum, qui collum hominis inuadit, nempe
strumas, praediti sunt: and ex omnibus locis ad co^ concurritur ad huius doni
effectum obtinendum. Salmero^ Ies. com. in 1. Cor. 11. disp. 20.. Octauo dubio.
the grace of healing is not frequent, or ordinary amongst them; and therefore
to uphold the now miraculous power, does allege only the graces given unto
the Kings of France and England, in healing of a swelling in the neck; which
For these Kings in such healings do not absolutely intend a miraculous work,
the ordinary effect whereof is to cure perfectly and in an instant only by
power of speech and touching: but they do after prayer commend the diseased
parties unto the ordinary means of Gods ordinance, even the cure of Physicians.
cannot be called a work properly miraculous.

proving the gift of prophesying, proceeds not beyond S. Francis, who lived in
the thirteenth age, as has been shown, and after him does not mention any
particular Prophet: neither all that have prophesied, be called Prophets.
Ribera proves out of the Fathers, falsely applied;) seeing that (when they
contend to prove this note to agree unto their Church) they do not of their
innumerable professors mention any one particular in the space of two hundred
years, who could rightly deserve the name of a Prophet? These confessions and
pretenses being duly compared, give us cause to think nothing so marvelous in
them, as are these their often and great ostentations of maruels. Next are we
to reveal

A second argument, taken from the apparent pronenesse which the Romanists
have, both in suggesting and believing strong delusions, especially in two
kinds, of Apparitions, and of feined Miracles.
First, Of Apparitions.
SECT. 2.
9 The first kind of infatuation, proceeds from ghostly Apparitions, which
Protestants dare not believe, and whereunto our Adversaries yield so great a
confidence, as to make them special grounds for the defense of their doctrines
of Quarta ratio (qua Purgatorium probamus) sumitur ab apparitionibus animarum
quae se in Purgatorio es^e renunciauerunt, and opem a viuis implorarunt.

Indulgences, and some prayer for the dead; notwithstanding it be acknowledged
by their own Jesuits, that ancient Fathers were of a contrary judgment,
their Jesuit Maldonate witnessing of Tertullian, Athanasius, Chrysostom,
Isidore, Theophylact, that they did all Chrysostom. Tertull. Athanas. Isidorus,
Theoph. prorsus negant (viz. animas mortuorum vnquam apparere) and cur fieri

nec a mortuis quid in altera a geratur vita audire velle. Maldon. Iesuita com.
in. Luc. 16. 27.
deny, that the souls of the dead do appear unto the living, yielding many
reasons thereof, especially this, that such apparitions are causes of seducing
in errors, and that therefore Christ would have his professors, for their
direction, to be contented with the holy Scriptures: their Jesuits Salmeron and
Pererius, confessing of S. Augustine, that Augustinus lib. 10. Confess.
misericorditer se liberatum su^s^e asserit a curiositate visionum and signorum.
Salmeron Ies. comm in 1. Job. 3. d. sp. 25.. Cauendum.
he rejoiced that he was maruellously delivered from that curiosity of visions,
Chrysostom. Augustinus: Simu^ant ^aemones, inquiunt animas defunctorum, quo
facilius animis hominum errores Gentilium inserant, ad eos decipiendos. Namque
homines animabus defunctorum vel parentum, vel cognatorum, vel amicorum suorum,
quos diligunt, and a quibus se diligi non dubitant, libentius and promptius
credunt, quam Daemoni, quem naturaliter horrent. Pererius Ies. de Magia, lib.
1. cap. 11.
further affirming, that it is the most easy way for the devil our ghostly
enemy to deceive us, by this taking upon him the resemblance of our dearest
friends.

10 Howbeit such is the mist of superstition, that the most Romanists cannot
hit this high way of ancient wisdom; for their Jesuit Salmeron does press
upon his reader an history of a marvelous apparition, confirmed (as he

England, registered in the Bibliotheke of holy Fathers, witnessed by Sigebertus
and S. Briget, believed and justified of all Schoolmen, honored by an ancient
and excellent monument in a Church of Rome, dedicated unto S. Gregory, viz.
How S. Gregory praying for the soul of Trajane the Emperor, who died an
infidel, and prevailed with God for his redemption out of the hell of the
damned: Gregorius pro Pagano precatus atque exauditus est, optione data vt aut
eius anima in Purgatorio per biduum puniretur, aut perpetua corpo^is
aegritudine dum viueret affligeretur: atque hoc secundum Gregorium acceptasle,
vnde acuto stomachi dolor, atque podagra perpetuo laborabat. Ibid. Quiuto.
upon condition that S Gregory himself would be contented to endure either
the torment of Purgatory for two days space, or else some bodily affliction
all the days of his life. S. Gregory chose the latter, and so was vexed with
the gout all his life long.

11 Here we perceive suggested a story of (for so he calls it) a miraculous
deliverance; and yet notwithstanding all these authorities for the proof, or
public monument for memory thereof, or the credulity which the English
Churches and the Romish schools gave unto it, their Bishop Episcopus Abulensis

Miracles: which is partly proved, and partly confessed.

(ex eodem Hieron. Ang).
the house wherein the virgin Marie was borne, seated in Galily, being (about
the year of Christ 1291.) possessed of Barbarians, and deprived of the ancient
worship which was given unto it, was translated by the hands of Angels from
Galily into Dalmatia, which contained the distance of more then two thousand
miles. Caeterum q^adriennio non toto, decrant quippe menses quinque interiecto,
sancta aedes ex Dalmatarum finibus cessit; Causa in incer^o est. -- Ibid. cap.
5. (ex Ann. Hieron. Ang.) Et coeleste hoc donum mira oportunitate transmissum

optauit: -- consedit in Recinetensis agri sylua, mill circiter passus a mari.
-- Cui syluae a Matrona eius Domina Lauretae nomen fuit. -- Inde Lauretana
aedes appellata. Ibidem, cap. 6.
From hence within the space of full four years it departed and slitted over
the sea into Itali^, in the time when all Italy was divided into the hot
factions of the Guelphes and Gibillines, and was seated in the region of
Picenum, in the wood of Lauretto (from whence it had the name to be called the
Ladies house of Lauretto:) Tenet fama (nec vana fides) venienti Deiparae
Domicilio a^bores obuias velut venerabundas inclin isle se: ac deinde pronas

Angel.) concordibus animis. Ibid ca. 7.
where, at the approaching of the house of the Mother of our Lord, the trees of
the forest did bow unto it, and continued so bent until they were either
blown down with winds, or cut down with axes, or fell down by their own
corruption. But this wood a while after proved an harbor for a multitude of
thieves, who robbed and slew many devout pilgrims, of such as came to do honor
unto this holy house; which caused the house to remove from thence (being taken
up by the hands of Angels) and to be placed (about the distance of a mile off)
upon a little hill, which belonged unto two brethren, who were then in great
concord between themselves. Ex sratrum colle, ob little auaritiam (qui sacro
auro inhiabant) discordiamque demigrat. -- Constat enim (ex H^^ron. Ang.)
nondum vertente anno, post eius in Italiam aduentum, in co colle, vbi nunc
visitur, consedisse. Tursellin. ibid. lib. 1. cap. 8. Postrema haec migratio
contigit anno 1295. Ibid cap. 10.
But yet ere that a year came to an end, by reason of a dissension which
covetousness, in sharing the sacred offerings, did kindle between them, it
was caused to forsake that hill, and to choose another hard by, where ever
since it has continued.

Here, indeed, is a Miracle, if it were true, worthy the pen of a fifth
Evangelist; but if false, unworthy the monuments of very Pagans. Res quamuis
admirabilis and antea inaudita vsque eo, tamen certa iam explorataque habetur,
vt de ea ambigere and dubitare sit nefas, quippe summa fide a maioribus velut
per manus accepta, deinceps traditur posteris, nec Illyricis Recinetensibusque
monumentis solum, sed Historicorum Pontisicum authoritate nixa est. Tursellin.
I^s. praes^t. in hist.
Although this be a matter wonderful and unheard of (says Turselline,) yet is
it so certain and tried, that it were impiety in any to doubt thereof;
because it was received by faithful Tradition of our forefathers, delivered
unto posterity, and recorded in the histories of the Illyrians and Italians:
Placuit Praetori Dalmatiae certos homiues in Galilaeam mittere, totam rem
intentius inspecturos. -- Nazarethum Galilaeae vrbem pergunt -- cernunt a^eam,
vbi S. S. domus steterat. Dimensi longitudinem, ac latitudinem areae,
fundamentorum crassitiem, reperiunt omnia prorsus conuenire. Idem lib. 1. cap.
4.
wherein we find that at the first remove thereof into Dalmatia, the people of
Illyria sent messengers into Galilie to try the place and foundation it had,
and the just proportion, and found it to be agreeable. After that Beatae Mariae
monitu per somnum Eremita, (cuius nomen non proditur) qui obtestabatur B.
Virginem, vt quid tandem facelli esset, and vnde esset certo aliquo indicio
declararet) Picentes (ex eodem authore Hieron. Ang.) ad rem explorandam
impellit, etc. Tursellin. lib. 1. cap. 12.
a devout Eremite, (whose name was not revealed) came to worship at Lauretto,
and prayed unto the blessed Virgin concerning that house, beseeching her to
manifest by some evidence, from whence it was: she being overcome by his
praters, admonished him in a dream to move the people of Picenum to send
messengers into Dalmatia, and into Galilie to inquire of the truth of the
matter: and fifteen messengers were sent, who avouched all to be true.

17 This is the sum of the story concerning the diverse and miraculous
stations, which this house made and the progresses it had from Galily unto the
little hill in Italy, where now it stands: and all (we see) is proved by
eyewitnesses. But we demand who are witnesses of these witnesses? we mean,
what ancient histories have recorded the truth of so admirable a Miracle?
Tursellinus promised to make this infallible by the records of Illyricum and
Recinetum, and other evidences: yet makes Hieronymus Angelita his author, Nec
dubia res: author est Hieronymus Angelita in Virginis Lauretanae Historia, quam
Clementi y. Pontifici Max. dicauit, eo ipso tempore, cum hoc visentibus
miraculo erat. Tursellinus lib. 1. hist. ^auret. cap. 9. and that this is the
only author, see every testimony.
who (says Tursellinus) dedicated his history unto Pope Clement the seventh.
Which proves by due Postrema, anno 1295. Tursell lib. 1. cap. 10. Clemens 7.

computation, that the author Angelita lived 228. years after the time of these
supposed events: and Tursellinus coming 90. years after Angelita dares assure
us of the truth of all; and yet complains that the Dcinde maiorum nostrorum
in talibus rebus memoriae prodendis incuria bonam partem subtrahebat materiae.
Idem Tursellinus Praef. in hist. s^ans, paulo post initium.
negligence of our ancestors in preserving the memory of such things, has
deprived us (says he) of a good part of matter concerning this story.

18 Wherefore although they judge it to be an impiety for any to doubt of the
truth, much more to dispute against it: yet have they by their report given us
cause to do both. For how shall we be persuaded the house would make choice of
the country of Italy, when the whole nation was rent into two most extreme
factions, seeing it could not endure to stay upon a little hill, because of the
dissension of but two brethren? or think that it would forsake a wood, because
it was an harbor of thieves, and yet still remain in Italy, which was and is
a patroness of stews? or that after the trial of eyewitnesses, they should
not be able to discern whether it was a whole Sunt qui non tam domum quim
cubiculum putent a caetera seiunctum domo. Me quidem haud poenitet eotum
sententiae esse. quibus simul cubiculum Virginis, and domum fuisle placet, etc.
Tursellinus lib. 1. cap. 2.
house or but a chamber? (notwithstanding a devil, called For their other
proof (mentioned by Tursellinus lib. 1. cap. 7.) where Antonia a French woman
is said to have sought by all means to be dispossessed of seven terrible
devils (among others, Heroth, Horribilis and Arcto were the names of three) by
the exorcisines of Stephanus the Priest at Lauretto, after that many Priests
both in France and Rome had attempted to help her, and could not: but after
that this Stephanu, had cast them all out, he was desirous to extort out of the
last, called Arcto, the truth of that house of our Lady, and adjured the devil
to tell the truth; he confessed that it was the very chamber of our Lady,
showing them besides where Mary stood when the Angel saluted her, and where
the Angel stood beside the window, etc. I say, we omit this as being unsavory
in it self, and prejudicial unto their own Churches in France and Rome
itself: for whenever miracles are undertaken, and have not been effected, it
was for want of faith either in the workers, or in the beholders. And will our
adversaries think the Priests and people of Rome defective in their faith?
Arcto, confessed that it was her chamber:) or that if it were lawful for an
Eremite (albeit their first trial) to doubt of the truth, and to pray to be
satisfied therein?

lived within the compass of an hundred years after, and were famous in their
times, writing purposely of the miracles and wonders done in that age, should
have omitted this.

21 Secondly, that Vincentius a Spaniard (who lived about the year 1459, and
whom the Romanists call a Saint,) entreating of Pilgrimage, says, that men and
women in going on pilgrimage break their necks, and become worse; for sometime
going out chaste, they return desiled: let us therefore (says he) undertake a
spiritual pilgrimage, which is (as the Apostle teaches) to live in the
spirit, and walk in the spirit: to day, and every day you may go unto
Nazareth, unto the place where the son of God was incarnate, as also unto
other holy places. Where we may observe that he would never have used this
tenor of speech, to say, that men might daily go (meaning in spirit) unto
Nazareth, unto the house where our Lord was incarnate, if at that time when he
writ, the house and Nazareth had been a thousand miles distant.

22 How then shall we give credit unto such stories as do pretend sufficient
evidence of ancient records, and can show none, but do leave the report very
proportionable and semblable unto the house, which they feine to have stood
without it own foundation?

23 Finally, this devised Miracle smells too much of an heathenish forge,
reported by c Pliny, of the Temple of Diana, which was (says he) removed out
of the Isle Zazyn thus unto Saguntum in Spain. We pass from this unto others.

24 In their public volumes of Councels compiled by Surius, and dedicated unto
the patronage of Philip the last King of Spain, there is suggested an
history, ascribed unto Athanasius, concerning a Sermo B. patris nostri
Athanasij Alexandrini Episcopi, de imagine D. nostri Jesus Christi, de miraculo
in ciuitate Beryto prodito. -- Ex qua cum Iudaei came contumeliose tractassent,

quo spectaculo gensilla ludaea conuersa erat, and multa ex eo sanguine effecta

Crucisixe, which after it was spit upon by the Jews, and wounded by spears,
and had received other such indignities, it did power out water and blood: by
the sight whereof many Jews were converted unto Christ, and many thereby were
healed of their bodily diseases. Albeit this Haec actio in editione vulgata non

now c^auing pardon for this serious confutation of so strawish and childish
intoxications, whereunto I was, by the incredulity of some, in a manner,

That the greatest security of a Christian stands in not affecting or
believing Miracles, which are suggested in these latter times for confirmation
of any truth.
SECT. 5.
34 Albeit our Savior, (who is the right hand of the Father) had manifested
himself to be the son of God by so evident wonders, that it was a sin
against the holy Ghost to deny them; and that from his fullness of power his
Apostles and other holy men in the Churches infancy and growth had received
the gift of Miracles, the scales of faith: yet considering, first from
Scriptures, that Christ has prophesied of the latter times of a general
apostasy from the faith by Matthew 24. 24.
great wonders, able to deceive, if it were possible, the very elect:
especially those, who 2 Thessalonians. 29. 10. 11.
would not receive the love of the truth, and through an effectall working of
Satan in lying wonders, and strong delusions shall be brought to believe lies.

35 In which consideration our Lord Christ has prescribed unto all true
believers a caution or antidote of See above cap. 17.. 3.
not believing them, as the only pr^seruatiue against all such intoxications,
as above from See ibid.
Fathers and our Adversaries themselves has been plentifully proved. May we
not then justly demand, which professors are like best to bear the brunt of
Antichrists tyranny, and to avoid the general apostasy, which shall be wrought
by the seducement of lying, but strange wonders? whether the Protestants who
being contented with the truth revealed in the word of God, do Luther and
Calvin. See above.
condemn all trial by Miracles in these latter times, or the Romanists, who
still maintain the visible power and gift of Miracles to be the perpetual
badge of true Religion.

36 Secondly, not only See above.
true Miracles have been wrought by false professors (although for confirmation
of a Christian truth,) but that also false wonders may be so called, because
they are either a falso, or ad falsum, that is, either wrought by false causes,
or unto false purposes, so that they can be Difficile erit (viz. tempore
Antichristi) discernere vera signa a falsis, vbi multa and magna erunt, and

hardly discerned (says their Jesuit Acosta) being most like unto true.
Insomuch as their Mendacia erunt ratione materiae, quia erunt phantastica and
praestigiae, -- and per illusiones. Propterea dicitur Apoc. 13. Antichristus
facturus miracula in conspectu hominu^, i. deludentia conspectum hominum, vt
Arethas notauit. -- Deinde licet vera sunt ratione formae, quia interdum res
veras operabit^r* sed quae non superabunt vires totius naturae, and ideo non
vera miracula erunt formaliter, quae a solo Deo fiunt, -- and vera sunt non
solum in conspectu hominum, sed etiam Angelorum. Bellar. lib. 3. de Romans Pont.
ca. 15.. Deinde.
material causes are false (as says their Cardinal) when fantastical
shadows are presented in stead of bodies, yet such men's eyes are deceived;
sometime the formal cause is false, when by natural, but secret causes, he
works strange effects. Which men mistake as proceeding from divine power,
when as indeed they are rather wonders of man's ignorance, then works of Gods
omnipotency. So likewise may men be deluded by false and feined pretenses,
wherewith the Devil persuades some to fast and to use godly exercises, with a
secret and hidden purpose to draw them into a spiritual presumption; so that
both in the manner, and in the end of his spiritual working, in a transfigured
Angel there may be hidden an indiscernable Satan.

37 He therefore that will distinguish of true professors, must warily and
religiously observe what side is more prone to deceive and be deceived by false
Miracles, and judge accordingly: and then recognize that the profession of
Protestants is an abandoning of the necessity of Miracles for confirmation of
their Apostolic faith, which was sufficiently confirmed by the Miracles of
Christ and his Apostles, and now needs no new seals to be added unto it.

38 Contrariwise we have observed in our Adversaries a palpable pronenesse to
be deluded by new apparitio^s (which is the road-way of all errors, as the
Fathers have said) and also by forged or misconceiued Miracles full of
impostureship. And how should it be otherwise? For where the spirit of
aequiuocating is predominant, teaching people to deceive men in their oaths
for the securing of their persons, and from freeing their cause from scandal,
how shall they not hold it expedient to use the same art in their Miracles, for
gaining (as they think) souls unto God? And then may we judge, whether
profession is less obnoxious unto the Antichristian apostasy, which shall be
wrought by pretense of Miracles, either through the raritie of the maruels, or
else by the stupiditie of the marueller.

39 For this we all know, that after the faith once received, it is the more

blessed, who see not, and yet believe. Wherefore let us be exhorted by S.
Augustine, to be like such as Quid tale is^i (that we may apply that unto false
miracles, which he writes of false Prophets) patiuntur, quale fecerunt, nisi

miraculous, then to study, to be truly virtuous; Si talis vita nostra esset,
quale^ Scripturae instituunt, multo magis de nobis qu^m de signa facientibus
Gentiles admirare^tur. Signa enim non vere sed phantastice nonnunquam
apparuisse suspicati sunt, and a daemonibus fieri credita, quamuis nostra
semper verissima fuerint: vita vero integra nullam vnquam patitur suspicionem,
sed omnium hominum, qui detrahunt, ora facile obstruit virtutis possessio. --
Extermina abs te omne delictum -- (magnus enim demon ^eccatum est) and mayor
tu eris, mihi creed, quam qui daemonia eijciunt. -- Si ex inhumanitate in
misericordiam transieris, sicca^ and ^ancam manum recuperasti, si theatralibus
ludis relictis Ecclesiam petieris, claudicantis pedem incolumitati restituisti;
si ocu^os a meretricio aspectu reuocaueris' coecum illumin^sti; si despectis
cantibus Diabolicis, spirituales psalmos didiceris, iam loqueris, cum antea
mutus fueris. Haec maxima miracula sunt. Paulo post: -- His alios a vitijs
reuocabimus, and nos ipsi aeternam vitam consequemur. Chrysostom. in Matthew. hom.
33. ad finem. Much to the like purpose has S. August. tom. 10. de verbis Dom*
in Matthew. Sermon. 18. Amplius est resuscitare semper victurum, quam resuscitare
iterum moriturum. August. Sermon. 44. de verbis Dom. And unto the same purpose
Greg. lib. 3. Dial. cap. 17.
for thus (says S. Chrysostom) shall we be more admirable even in the sight
of the heathen, then by working any other wonders; because the abhorring of
sin is of more power then the casting out of many Devils.

40 Finally, seeing we may justly suspect those times, which are fallen upon
us, to be plainly Antichristian, be we contented to be directed by that lamp
which burns day and night in the Temple of God, even the sacred Scripture,
Omnino nulla alia res aduersus tyrannidem Antichristi perinde armabit ath^etas
Christi, quam coelestis doctrinae inuictissima authoritas: vbi enim suprema
tentatio, ibi praeclariora Scripturarum remedia oppo. sita sunt. Acosta Ies.

then which (as Fathers have taught, and their own Jesuit Acosta now
confesses) nothing can better shield the soldier of Christ from the tyranny
of Antichrist.

AND in this faith thus dedicated and continued* have your MAJESTY'S most noble
Ancestors (KINGS and QVEENS of this Realm) for so many ages together lived and
died, with peace toward God, and honor to the world: In this faith died your
HIGHNESS dearest MOTHER (of blessed Memory) admired at her death for her most
Christian resolution, the which (at the the time of her funeral) was
accordingly and for such celebrated, even by the then Preacher Protestant, whom
the Puritanes publicly, and reprochfully traduced, for that (to use their own

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
ALL that hitherto has been discussed by these obiectors, concerning the faith
of Britons, Grecians, Armenians, orthodoxall Fathers, or Jews, has aimed at
this one scope, viz. the justifying of the now Roman faith: and now after the
visitation of the faith of other nations and persons, they retire themselves
unto their home, being willing that we should examine the now Romish faith in
the Romish Church it self, and in those whom they account to have been the
late professed members thereof, and begin (as we see) with his Majesty's most
noble progenitresse; not considering that S. Paul exhorting the Co^inthians
unto sanctity, thus, 1. Cor. 11. ver. 1
Be you (says he) followers of me, as I am of Christ, did thereby teach us
that Christ is the only archetypon and absolute mirror or pattern of
holiness: and that whatsoever other persons in the world, are but a quatenus,
and can challenge no more then a limited right of imitation, even so far as
they be true followers of Christ Jesus. Which accords with the profession of
our now dread Sovereign, as his Majesty himself in his late Praemonit. unto
the States of Christendom, anno 1609.
answer unto this objection has most religiously protested.

2 The Reverend Bishop now mentioned, understanding how that great and
honorable personage in the last act of her life, renounced all presumption of
her own inherent righteousness, and wholly affianced her soul unto Christ, in
belief to be justified only by his satisfactorie justice, did therefore
conc^iue hope of her salvation by the virtue of that cordial, prescribed by
the holy Apostle, viz. that * where sin abounds, the grace of God does
super-abound: which the Apostle has ministered for the comfort of every
Christian, who erring by ignorance, shall (in sincere repentance, especially
for all known sins) depart this mortal life, having the heel or end of his
life shod with this preparation of the Gospel of peace, not of the new Romish,
but of the old Catholic faith, which is the faith of all Protestants.

3 And this consideration of that our Ecclesiastes or Preacher, cannot but
worthily condemn the Apologists of a partial prejudice, who choose rather to
be informed concerning that Sermon by (as they confess) a reproachful traducer
and libeller, then (which they might easily have done) by the testimonies of a
thousand temperate and indifferent hearers* then present. From this particular
instance they proceed to a general.

CHAP. II. Of the Romish Church; how far the members thereof may be thought
capable of salvation, without any prejudice unto the religion of Protestants.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And this is acknowled by Protestants as sufficient to salvation. To this faith
likewise have all the learned Protestants of sober judgment affoorded the
promises of hopeful salvation, as appears most plainly. 1. By their own
most evident testimonies. 2. By their like confessed examples thereof given. 3.
And by their undoubted answerable practice. To give proof of every of these
parts.

And 1. First concerning their testimonies in this kind: M. D. Baro says, M. D
Baro in his four sermons and two questions disputed ad clerum, etc. sermon. 3.
page 448. fine.
I dare not deny the name of Christians to the Romanists, fith the learneder
writers do acknowledge the Church of Rome to be the Church of God. And M.
Hooker also says: (e) The Church of Rome is to be reputed a part of the house
of God, a limme of the visible Church of Christ: and M. Hooker vbi supra, page
130. ante med.
we gladly acknowledge them to be of the family of Jesus Christ: M. Bunnie
likewise says of Catholics and Protestants: M. Bunnie in his treatise tending
to Pacification, sect. 18. p. 109. circa med.
Neither (f) M. Hooker in his third book of Ecclesiastical Policy, page 188.
initio. And Johannes Regius in his liber Apologeticus, etc p. 95. fine, says,
In Papatu autem cum suerit Ecclesia vera, etc.
of us may justly account the other to be none of the Church of God, M. Bunnie
vbi supra, page 213. post med.
we are no several Church from them, nor they from us: In like sort does M. D.
Some in defense thereof (against Penrie the Puritan) say: M. D. Some in his
defense against M. Penry, and refutation of many absurdities, etc. in M.
Penries treatise, page 164. ante med.
that the Papists are not altogether aliens from Gods covenant, I have showed
before: for M. D. Some vbi supra, page 182. initio.
in the judgment of all learned men, and all reformed Churches, there is in
Popery a Church, a Ministry, a true Christ etc. M. D. Some vbi supra, page
176. prope sine.
If you think that all the popish sort which died in the popish Church are
damned, you think absurdly, and diss^nr from the judgment of the learned
Protestants. Lastly to omit many others Peter Martyr, as appears by his
Epistles annexed to his Common places in English, page 153. a. sine, desired at
the conferen^e had at Poysie between the Catholics and Protestants, that
they should not for diversity of opinion break brotherly chaeritie, nor call
one another Heretics. And see the same opinion yet further affirmed by the
Protestant writer against Nicholas Machiuel, printed at London 1602. page 80
post medium, and 83. paulo post medium, and 85. prope finem.
for we are unwilling to become tedious to your MAJESTY) M. D. Couell in his
late treatise published by authority, and dedicated to the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, defends this opinion at large, and concludes M. D. Conel in his
defense of M. Hookers five books of Ecclesiastical Policy, published by
authority, page 77. ante med.
saying: We affirm them (of the Church of Rome) to be parts of the Church of
Christ, and that those that live and die in that Church, may notwithstanding be
saved: In so much as he doubts not to charge the Puritanes with M. D. Couel
vbi supra, page 68. paulo post med.
ignorance, for their contrary opinion. 4 Hitherto concerning their
testimonies before undertaken.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THis question, as it is propounded, does concern only the state and
condition of particular Churches: and because all the hammering used in this
Apology has no other intent then to fasten in the mind of the Reader a
presumption of security in the Romish profession, and so much the rather
because it (even by the voices of the Adversaries thereof) may be thought to to
be a member of the Church of God, and therefore not utterly fo^lo^ne of saving
grace: hereby euincing (as they think) no small prejudice unto the Churches of
Protestants, which they will seem to judge contrary-wise, to be members cut
off from the mystical body of Christ: therefore it belongs unto us to
reioine upon them, and to show how inconsiderate, unlearned, unjust, and (if I
may so speak) unlucky they themselves may find this their pretense to be, by
the sequel of this dispute, whereunto we proceed by just paces, first showing

That a particular visible Church may be called a true Church, although it err
in some weighty points of doctrine.
SECT. 2.
2 This position cannot seem strange unto any, who is not himself a stranger
to the understanding of the state of the Church, both under the old and new
Testament. In the old, Jerusalem, being in some respect a virgin Church, is
called, in some other respect, an Esa. 1. 21. How is the faithful city become
a whore.
whore: and Iudaea Gods peculiar, is denied the title of a Hos. 2. 2. She is

wife. The Synagogue of the Jews by John Baptist is termed Matthew. 12. 39. An
evil and adulterous generation requires a sign.
evil and adulterous, whilst as yet (by our Christi Ecclesia non nisi Christo
iam assumpto and glorificato coepit. Stapleton. lib. 2 doct. princip. cap. 11.
page 60.
Adu^rsaries confession) it remained the true Church of God. Some such like
examples we find in the visible Churches of the new Testament, in the times of
the Apostles, such as were the Churches of Gal. 1. 6. I marvel that you are so
soon removed away unto another Gospel.
Galatia, 2. Cor. 11. 3. But I fear lest -- your minds should be corrupt from
the simplicity which is in Christ.
Corinth, Apocalyp. 2. 14. 15. Because thou have them who maintain the
doctrine of Balaam -- etc. even so have thou them who maintain the doctrine of
the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.
Ephesus, Apoc. 2. 20. I have a few things against thee, that thou suffer
the woman Iezabel, who calls her self a Prophetess, to teach and deceive my
servants, to make them commit fornication.
Thyatyra, Apocal^^. 3. 1. Thou have a name that thou live, but art dead,
etc. verse. 4. notwithstanding thou have a few names yet in Sardis, which have
not defiled their garments.
Sardis; notwithstanding some of the Pastors among these professors were called
Angels, and their seats Churches.

3 And since those Apostolical times, S. Augustine has thus determined: De
Scriptura Canonica dubitari non potest, vtrum verum vel vtrum rect^m sit,
qui^qu^d in ea scriptum esse constiterit: Episcoporum autem literas -- and per
aliorum Episcoporum grauiorem authoritatem, -- and per Concilia, licere
reprehendi, si quid in eis forte a veritate deuiatum est, ipsa quoque Concilia,
quae per prouincias siunt, plenariorum Conciliorum authoritati -- cedere;
denique ipsa plenaria saepe priora posterioribus emendari. August. lib. 2. de
Baptismo, contra Donat. cap. 3. writing against the Donatists, who urged the
Council o^ Carthage under Cyprian, wherein the question of Rebaptization was
handled.
There is no doubt (says he) of the truth of any thing, which is contained in
Scripture; but as for the letters of Bishops, or decrees of provincial
Councels, they are subject unto reprehension, yea former general Councels may
be corrected (speaking concerning matters of doctrine) by general Councels
following: as accordingly was performed by diverse The Council of Arimin
defining that Filius Dei non consubstant^alis, sed similis Patri dicebatur. See
above l. b. 1. cap. 1. Sect. 2. lit. d. Which was afterward corrected by the
Council of Constantin^ple* so the Council of Ephesians. 2 oppugning the distinct
natures of Christ: corrected by the Council of Chalcedon, act. 1. and the
Council of Carthage, in the qu^stion of Rebaptization: corrected by the First
Councel^ of Nice, Can. 19. Finally the second Council of Ni^e standing for the
worship of Images, controlled by the Council of Frankford. Bellar. lib. 2. de
Conc. cap. 8.
Councels, correcting other precede^t ones in these great points of
consubstantialitie, of the two distinct natures in Christ, of rebaptization, of
worshipping of Images. Our next position is,

That it is possible for some to be saved, who are members of an unsound Church.
SECT. 3.
4 The belief of some articles are so absolutely necessary for the
constitution of a true Church, as a reasonable soul is for the essential
being of a man: such as concern the knowledge of the unity of the Godhead,
and the Trinity of persons, together with the true and faithful apprehension
of the natures of Christ the Messiah, God and man; the power of his death and
resurrection, by which we have remission of sins, and after death life
everlasting. For when the Apostle writ against idolatrous worshippers of
Angels, he makes their case desperate, but why? Non tenentes caput, because
they hold not the Coloss. 2. 19.
head Christ.

5 Wherefore we presume, that in a Church, although corrupted with error and
superstition, yet if it do not ruinate the foundation, the erroneous and
superstitious professors may be saved: even by the virtue of that tenor which
is in capite, viz. Christ Jesus, the Lord and author of life. Which
notwithstanding we must so understand, as that the error and superstition do
proceed not from knowledge, but from ignorance; which ignorance is not
affected, but simple, by that simplicity of heart, that is both desirous to
know and profess the truth of God, and void of confidence of his own
perfection, craving pardon for sins both of ignorance and of presumption, and
flying unto the justice of faith, which is the righteousness of Christ for
justification by him. Unto such ignorants we may make bold to apply the
sentence of S. Cyprian (spoken in another case:) Ideo frater si qu^s de
antecess^ribus nostris vel ignoranter vel simpliciter hoc non obseruauit, quod
nos facere Dominus exemplo and magisterio suo doc^^t, potest simplicitati eius
de indulgentia Domini venia concedi: nobis vero non poterit ignosci, qui nunc a
Domino admoniti and instructi samus. Cy^rian. lib. ^. (...). 3. a^ Cae^il.
If any of our ancestors (says he) upon simple ignorance, have not observed
that which God has commanded, the Lord may, in regard of his simplicity,
pardon his sin: but if we should transgress, who are instructed in his will,
we might not presume of any favor.

6 This leaves all them (who have seen the light of the Gospel, and shall
back-slide) void of all excuse by pretense of simplicity. Hereunto S.
Augustine does accord, when writing unto the Donatists, he says: Qui
sententia^ suam, quamuis falsam at que peruersam, nulla animositate aut
pertinacia defen lunt, praesertim quam non audacia suae praesumptionis
pepererunt* sed a seductis and in errorem lapsis parentibus acceperunt*
quaerunt autem cauta solicit^dine veritatem, corrigi parati cum inuenerint,
nequa quam sunt inter haeretic^s deputandi. -- quanquam ipsum haereticum
quamlibet odiosa superbia tumidum and peruicacia malae contentionis insanum,
sicut vitandum monemus, ne fallat paruulos, ita non abnuimus quibu^cunque modis
postumus corrigendu^, vnde factum est vt ad nonnullos Donatistaru^ primarios
scriberemus, non co^municatorias literas, etc. August. initio epist. 162.
Gloris and Elusio, and to other Donatists intituling these Fratres.
They that defend their false doctrine without obstinate boldness, especially
if they be not such as have been authors of those errors, but either received
it from their Parents, ^r were s^duced by others, and do carefully seek the
truth, being ready to be refermed as soon as they shall see their wanderings,
such men I say (says he) are not to be esteemed as heretics.

7 Yet far be it from us so to presume of the simple, or rather
sottishignorance, as their Jesuit Tolet has done, who in his book of
instructions for Priests, teaches, that Rursus, si rusticus circa articulos
eredat suo Fpiscopo proponenti aliquod dogma haereticum, meretur in credendo,
licet sit error, quia tenetur credere, donec ei constet esse contra Ecclesiam.
Tolet. Ies. Instruct. Sacerd. lib. 4. cap. 3.. In summa.
if a rural man, and ignorant of the articles of says, shall believe an
heretical doctrine, which his Bishop shall teach him, he (says Tolet) does
merit by thus believing, because he is bound to believe it, until he perceive
it to be contrary unto the Church. Never was this doctrine of rural
simplicity taught by ancient Fathers, or (as we think) by any of their
followers, before this present time. For what? Is any one bound to believe any
man preaching an heriticall doctrine? ^y what law? The Apostle says, Galat. 1.
8.
although we, or an Angel from heaven, shall preach unto you otherwise then
that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed: and shows that
man's conscience is bound not to whom, but to what, that is, to believe only a
truth, although it were taught by the Devil; and not any person preaching
heresy, although he should be an Angel from heaven. But that also such a
believer of heresy should merit of God by his erroneous faith, this seems to
exceed all bounds of Christian instruction: for so simplicity in e^ring should
be excused, not only a tanto, but a toto; and not this only, but even
justified also, and approved for (as they call it) a meritorious good. Which
being granted, then that See above Sect. 2. lit. d. and alil^ sae^^^.
crucisige, that is, crucisie him, (which voice the people uttered in belief
of their Priests against our Savior Christ) should not have deserved (as it
did) a bloody vengeance upon themselves, and upon their posterity; especially
if we shall suppose that Synagogue to have been then the true Church, as some *
Romanists have already affirmed.

8 Notwithstanding, in this error of the Jesuit there is inuolued a piece of
truth, viz. that some man entangled in heresy, by reason of his simplicity in
erring (if otherwise he have faith in the Son of God) may be capable of
grace. To conclude, the obseruable points of this position, (to wit,) that any
living in an unsound Church may be capable of life, are these. 1. If he destroy
not any maine foundation of faith. 2. If the erroneous have not had a former
illumination of truth, from the which (by want of love to practice it) he is
become an apostate. Of such an one the Apostle has pronounced, that he is
given up to 2 Thessalonians. 2. 11.
believe lies, and his case is in a sort desperate. 3. If the ignorant be
prepared to know and acknowledge the saving truth. 4. If he have no confidence
of meriting and deserving grace by his simple and unaffected ignorance, but in
humility of his soul pray for forgiveness. Upon this follows a third
position

That although not all unsound Churches, yet some are safely to be forsaken.
SECT. 4.
9 Unsoundness of a Church happens either in manners, or in doctrine. The
license which some use, to rent the coat of Christ by taking offense at the
wicked lives of the Pastors and professors in the Church, is repressed by our
Saviors speech; Matthew. 23. 3.
All whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do, but after their
works do not, for they say, but do not. The corrupt life of the worshipper
cannot defile the worship which God himself has ordained and sanctified.

10 Secondly, every corrupt custom used in the public worship of God, does
not immediately enforce a separation from that Church, except the custom be in
it self idolatrous: for we read how Deuteronomy. 12.
high places, and groves were expressly forbidden by God, yet (as Excelsa era^t
alti colles in quibus contra legem Dei, sed tamen patiente Deo, sub frondosis
arboribus sacrificarunt: ac primum Deuteronomy. 12. Deus ea prohibuit: Subuertite
omnia loca, luco^ comburite. -- Deinde Iudicum tempore ad ea sacrificari
permisit: primo Gedeon Judge. 6. -- and Saul 1. Reg. 9. and Salomo^ 1 Paral. 2.
3. Reg. 3. Dilexit autem Salomo^ Dominum, excepto quod in excelsis immolabat.
--
Sigonius observes) were they used by holy men until the building of the
Temple, as by Gedeon and Solomon; concerning which use S. Augustine says, that
De hoc instituto sic Augustinus in librum Iudicum: Deus consuetudinem populi
sui, in qua praeter eius tabernaculum tamen non dijs alienis offerebant, sed
Domino suo, sustinebat potiu^ quam vetabat, etiam sic audiens offerentes. Vt
refert Carolus Sigonius de repub. Heb. lib. 2. cap. 4.
God beholding this custom of his people in offering sacrifice without the
Tabernacle (yet not to other gods, but to himself) did suffer rather then
forbid it, and graciously heard those that offered it.

11 Thirdly, if the corruption be doctrinall, this may be considered either as
it is universally held, or but either by a less or more common exposition. In
this second respect there can be no just cause of division, as the abouenamed
examples of the Sea above Sect. 2.
Churches of the Jews, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Thiatyra, and Sardis do
warrant us. God may not be forsaken, because the devil stands at his left
hand; the Lords barn must not be set on fire, because of the chafe; the fold
of Christ his sheep must not be forsaken for the company of goats, nor his
net of sound fishes broken, for the mixture of the putrified and corrupt. Abell
may offer his sacrifices with Cain, the penitent Publicane say his prayers with
the Pharisee, Christ's disciples communicate with Judas, even then when they
have a sign that this is he, viz. who was guilty of the highest treason that
ever could be imagined. But when we shall find that the error of doctrine
either concerning Gods worship or points of faith, is general, and not only
in the profession (that man may retain a liberty of not allowing it) but also
in prescription and exaction; the^ is the door opened for Apoc. 13. 4.
going out, then is the time of Leuit. 13 46. Secede, 1. 5.
separation from leprosy, then are we forbidden to Hos. 10. 15. and 5. and 8.
ascend unto Bethauen, the house of vanity, although it shall carry the name
of Bethel, which is, the house of God: and many such like warrants we have from
the blessed 2. Cor. 11. 3. and 1. Pet. 1. 2. and 1. Tim. 6. 4. and 2. Tim. 2.
17.
Apostles. This point has begot a fifth, viz.

That the objected testimonies of Protestants, for the auouching the truth of
the Romish Church, do no more advantage our Adversaries, then it may do any
heretics, who have not directly destroyed the fundamental points of faith.
SECT. 5.
12 If any shall but peruse the same Treatises, from whence the forenamed
testimonies have been borrowed, for proof, that some dying in the unity of
that Church, may be saved, he shall find them all protest against the doctrine
and the worship which is commonly professed and practiced therein, as being in
their judgment idolatrous and Antichristian, and holding it a damnation to
themselves to consent thereunto: but yet they (not daring to close the arms of
Christ, which were stretched out upon the Cross to embrace all that without
obstinate blindness of error in points of faith, or purpose of continuance in
any known sin, shall with Thomas touch by faith the print of his sides, and
have their consciences dyed in his precious blood) have conceived (as they
ought) a salvation for such, not only in the Romish, but in other erroneous
Churches; being taught not utterly to despair of that soul which does not
despair of the mercy of God in Christ, but shall by faith (as the woman with
the bloody issue did) Matthew. 9.
touch but the hemme of his vestment* for who knows how great that virtue is
which may issue from him who has Coloss. 2. 9.
all fullness of the godhead dwelling in him bodily?

13 And so much less may we despair of some of the members of the Roman
Church, by how much more evident it is, that notwithstanding they write in
their books of a perfect justification by inherent justice, yet is not this
radical in their hearts: for by their practice at the hour of death, even
then when they presume that they are to perform the act of Martyrdom, they,
renouncing all confidence of their perfectness, do cast anchor, with us, upon
the mercy of God in his Christ, and our Jesus, for the full remission of
sins.

14 Howsoever, the testimonies themselves, and the reasons which are annexed,
do plainly show, that the aboue-cited Protestants yield no more security unto
the Romish Church, then they do unto any other, wherein there is a true
Baptism, and the profession of the chiefest Principles of faith. Hereunto we
annexe a sixth position, viz.

That the Church of Rome is not properly the Catholic, but a particular
Church: and is therefore as other Churches, subject unto error.
SECT. 6.
15 We hear their Cardinal defend this custom used of the Romanists, which
is (without the Creed) to call the Solemus extra Symbolum cum veram fidem aut
Ecclesiam describibimus, came Catholicam, Aposto^icam, Romanam appella^e.

true Church, the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman Church: which if it were
equiualently to make the Catholic, that is, the universal and the Roman
synonymies, and of an equal extent and signification (which they do by reason
of the universal jurisdiction which they attribute unto the Pope) this will be
no less a solecisme, then to confound these two terms universal and
particular: because, as our ^rra^e posse vnamquamque particularem Ecclesiatr.

as other particular Churches subject unto error, as containing but one
particular diocese distinct from all others.

alleges, that Quaestio est vtrum Petri successor in universally Ecclesiae cu^a

the successor of S. Peter, and universal Bishop of the Church, was by the
ordinance of Christ appointed to be the Bishop of Rome, and not by any humane
authority: yielding in effect this consequence, viz. if it were possible that
the Papal authority might be translated unto some other diocese, as unto
Antioch, or elsewhere, then could not the Church of Rome pretend any
privilege of never erring from the true faith. Quod Episcopus Romanus, quia
Romanus est, sit Petri successor, ex facto Petri o^tum habuit, non ex prima
institutione Christi: nam potuisset Petrus nullam sedem particularem sibi
vnquam eligere. Bellar. lib. 2. de Romans Pont. cap. 12.. At vero. Senten tia est

But the Bishop of Rome (says Cardinal Bellarmine,) was not appointed by
Christ to be the successor of S. Peter, as he was Bishop of Rome: whence by due
inference it will follow, that therefore the Roman Church, as it is the Roman
Church, has no special prerogative that it shall never apostate from the
faith. From this does issue a seventh position, viz.

That to be separated from the communion of the Romish Church, is not in it
self damnable: proved by the confessed examples of glorious and ancient
Churches and Fathers.
SECT. 7.
17 The supreme challenge, which our Adversaries make, and which with an
universal consent they have erected as the arch-pillar of all the Roman
faith, is to profess, that Vnio membrorum cum capite (Pontifice Roma^^) est

and the troops of Martyrs in that Church, who jointly impugned the
jurisdiction which the Pope then challenged concerning appeals unto Rome?
Whereunto our Adversaries vouchsafe this answer, saying, We are not bound to
allow their decrees. This point is worth the handling, therefore will we lay
open the matter at large.

20 Some hundredth years after this opposition unto the Papal claim of
Appeal, Eulalius Bishop of Carthage submitted himself unto Pope Boniface the
second; whereupon the Pope does not a little insult, calling the former
Affricane Bishops, Postquam Asri per centu^ annos in schismate per ever assent,

schismatics, who for the space of an hundred years, (as his Epistle
reports) had withstood his pretended jurisdiction. Gladly would we understand
what our Adversaries will say unto the severe sentence of Pope Boniface.

esse, (Bonifacij and ^ulalij) Epistolas. Bellar. lib. 2. de Romans Pont. cap. 25.

suspecteth this Epistle of Boniface to be counterfeit. Cardinal Baronius is
more peremptory: Quid improbe improbus finxit impostor (vehementius enim

What an impostor was he who forged this Epistle? For I am greatly offended
(says he) with the^ who overthrow (meaning the Romish) the Church, which by
lying they meant to establish, by affirming that the Church of Affricke was
divided from the Church of Rome: whereupon it must sollow that we must raze out
of the Catalogue of Saints those worthy not Confessors only, but also Martyrs
among the Affricans, who died for the profession of Christ in the persecution
of those times, and were famous both for learning and godliness. So he.

22 But contra^iwise M. M. Harling against E. swell, Art. 4. (...) 28.
Harding maintains the foresaid reconciliation of the Church of Affricke
(after the schism thereof for the space of an hundred years) by the submission
of Eulaluts Bishop of Carthage, from this foresaid Epistle of Boniface, wherein
the Pope gave thanks unto God for restoring of those Affricane Churches unto
the Catholic Church. Whereupon he infers an ancient acknowledgement of the
Primac^^ of the Bishop of Rome. So likewise their Jesuit Turrian to the same
purpose, says, that Quod (...) Patres Carthagenenles tunc peccarunt, postea
successores cotum (...). Turrianus Ies. as he ^^cited by Sadad. part. after a

the successors in that Church of Affricke did correct the offense which those
predecessors had made. And their Jesuit Costerus urges the same Epistle of
Boniface for proof of the same Recte and pro officio secetunt Romans Pontifice^:
male autem Africani, qui etiam tunc (vt testatur Bonifacius 11. epist. ad

defection or schism of those Africanes from the subjection of the Pope. And
of all others their Lindanus does herein most busily bestirre himself:

If this story (says he) confirmed by the Epistle of Pope Boniface and other
ancient Records, be to be called into question, then what have we in all
Ecclesiastical antiquity certain and unquestionable for the confirmation of
any matter which cencerneth the state of the Church?

23 From this spirit of contradiction, which has thus possessed the principal
Doctors of the Romish Church, our reader will presently observe, that if the
Epistle be false, then all such like Papal Ecclesiastical stories which are
brought in for proof of the Primacie of other Popes, may be as justly
suspected (as Lindanesheweth) to be merely forged and foysted stuff. And if
we shall admit it as true, then (as their Baronius argues) all those
Africanes, whose names the Church has recorded among the holy Confessors and
Martyrs, must no more be called Martyrs, but schismatics, and be judged to be
Cum praesertim certum exploratumque sit, nullam esse posse schismaticorum
coronam and praemiu^, quae non -- nisi dentur in Ecclesia Catholica -- Cum si

Baronius quo supra, number. 93.
not crowned with bliss, but damned in hell; and all for the maintenance of
the Papal prerogative.

24 Do we not now see into what a miserable perplexity our Adversaries have
driven themselves? The one side defend the truth of that story, and had rather
that multitudes of Martyrs should be accounted reprobates, then so evident a
testimony for the Popes Primacie should perish: the other side, lest that the
example of those orthodoxall Churches and worthy Martyrs who neglected the
Popes communion, might prejudice his Primacie, do reject the Popes Epistle as
fabulous. The issue of all which will be this, that if the story be false, then
the principal evidences which our Adversaries usually suggest, for proof of
the Papal Primacie, incur the suspicion of falsehood: and if the story be
true, then must we either pronounce damnation upon the souls of faithful
Martyrs, or else in some cases contemn the Popes excommunication, and Roman
communion.

25 But be this Epistle of Pope Boniface either true of false, this we know,
that the unquestionable See hereafter.
story which they have recorded in the body of their Councels, shows
plainly, that the Bishops of Afric, among whom S. Augustine was principal
actor, did resolutely conclude and decree against the Popes claim of appeals
unto Rome. So that if after this the Pope did not excommunicate them, it was
because he then thought, that he had no such authority: and this is no small
wound unto the Primacie. But if they were therefore excommunicated, and
notwithstanding still continued in that opposition, then the examples of so
grave, learned, and holy Bishops, and their sucsessors, faithful confessors
and Martyrs (who for the hope of salvation yielded up their deares^liues, and
are now acknowledged for Saints in glory) do all preach against the foresaid
principal article of the now Romish faith, which holds the subjection and
union with the Pope of Rome, to be necessary unto salvation.

26 Furthermore, if this article shall stand for credible, then no less
fearful a doom must also seize upon millions of souls, which have for many
ages died in the Greek Church, which both anciently, and at this present are
divided from the Roman jurisdiction, and are by our Adversaries called
schismatics even at this day: but yet (as some of them affirm) Alij vero
opinantur Graecos solum esse schismaticos, non haereticos: Schismaticos quidem
quia a Romans Pontificis jurisdiction and potestate se subtrahunt; haereticos
non item, quontam in praedictis fidei articulis potius nomine quim re a Romans
Ecclesiae sensu dissentiunt: (the maine point) Dicunt Spir. S. a Patre per
^iluim procedere ab omni aeternitate. Afterward the Iesu^te himself, when he
has reckoned all that seemed to him erroneous in the Greek Church, passes no
deeper censure upon them then peradventure heretics. Quicquid fit de hi^ce
fidei articulis, in quibus multi Graeci and alij, Orientales fortasse, male
fide errant, and proinde haeretici sunt. Azor. Ies. ^ist. Moral. part. 1. lib.
8 c. 20.. Decimo quaeritur.
only schismatics, not heretics. But why schismatics only? Because (says
our Adversary) they do not acknowledge the Popes jurisdiction over them.

27 The like might be said of other the remote Churches of Assyria, and
elsewhere: wherein are innumberable professors, which believe in Christ the
Son of God, and do (as D. Field in his 3. book of the Church.
one has shown) keep the true foundation of Christian faith: and must every
one of these likewise perish for want of a dependence upon the Roman Sea? Do
not rather all these examples of Churches, in number so many, some in time so
ancient, so large in extent, and most of them in their memory so famous and
graceful, plainly tell us, that this credo, etc. (that is, Sanctam,
Catholicam, and Apostolicam, Romanam Ecclesiam, omnium Ecclesiarum matrem and

better of the Council of Trent then of a Rex Christianissimus negabat se

private convent, the authority whereof has not been fully acknowledged of
the Romanists in France until this day.

29 By this any may perceive what is the merciless ambition of our Adversaries
defense, who for the establishing of the safety of one only Roman Church, do
peremptorily, not only exclude all the Churches of Protestants in France,
Germany, England, Scotland, Polonia, Denmark, Heluetia, Hungary, Sueuia, and
other places, from all hope of life, but also, by the same consequence, all the
Asian Churches, when they were watered with the blood of glorious Martyrs;
besides many orthodoxall souls in other Churches (which have been at all times
innumerable,) who have not subjected themselves unto the Roman Papacy.

30 And now we refer this case unto the wisdom of our Christian Reader, to
judge which professors stand in more absolute and Catholic union with
Christians; whether Protestants, who discerning between men's erros and their
persons, do so far communicate in their hope with all Christians, who living
a godly life, do fundamentally profess the faith of Christ: or the Romanists,
who for the advancement of one Church, do deliver up unto Satan, and unto
desperation, all other Christian Churches and Professors in the world. This
consideration has begotten an eight position, viz.

That the foresaid pretense of necessary Union with the Roman head and
Church, will prove either the same Roman head or else the Roman Church to be
schismatic.
SECT. 8.
31 Now comes in a conflict, wherein we find the Roman body and head, that
is, a Council and the Pope, like unto Jacob and Esau, striving for the
birthright and preeminencie: Nos defendimus summum Pontificem simpliciter and
absolute esse supra Ecclesiam vniuersam, and supra Conc^lium generale: ita vt
nullum supra se Iudicem agnoscat. Bellar lib. 2. de Conc. author. cap. 17. in
principio.
We defend (says Cardinal Bellarmine) that the Pope is absolutely above the
universal Church and general Council, not acknowledging any Judge over him.
And that Haec, quamuis nullo Decreto publico definita est, tacito tamen
Doctorum consensu (vt aliae quaestiones in Ecclesia olim ortae non paucae)
plane definita est, vix vno amplius doctiore Theologo aliam de hac re

Stapl. doctr. princip. lib. 13. cap. 15.. Dixeram tertio.
the Pope is above a Council (says D. Stapleton) it is now defined by the
secret consent of all Divines, scarce any one holding the contrary. But if any
should prefer the authority of a Council before the jurisdiction of the
Pope, Qui Concilium universal Pontifice superius faciunt, pugnant illi reuera
(licet non aduertentes) cum certissima fide de D. Petri ac Romans Pontificis in
Ecclesia primatu. Gregorius de Valent. Analys. lib. 8. cap. 7.. Atque hinc.
page 87. col. 2.
they (says their Jesuit Valentia) do thereby oppugn the undoubted faith of
the Primacie of the Pope.

31 We doubt that this their doctrine, which is now so universal in that
Church, will prove the Pope and his defendants to be schismatic: for in the
Council of Basil the case was thus collected out of S. Hierome and Augustine,
and the two ancient Popes: viz. that it is necessary Probatur authoritatibus
Papam subesse Concilio, Si authoritas quaetitur (inquit Hieron.) orbis mayor
est vrbe. -- Ex hinc si matter omnium fidelium est Ecclesia, Romanum etiam
Pontificem in silium habet. Alias vero (sicut beatist. Augustinus praedicat)
nunquam habebit Deum Patrem, qui Ecclesiam noluerit recognoscere in Matrem.
Quod Anacletus intelligens, Vniuersalem Ecclesiam (Canonistae sciunt) Matrem
suam appellac, and Cali^tus sicut silius ait se venire implere voluntatem
Matris nostrae, quae est Ecclesia. Vnde apparet tanto superiorem esse Ecclesiam

that the Pope should be subject unto a Council, for if the Church be a
Mother, then must the Pope acknowledge himself to be her son: otherwise, how
shall he have God for his Father? This our Savior showed when he said unto
Peter [Tell the Church:] which authority if the Pope shall contemn, he ought
to be accounted as an Ethnicke and Publican. Which argument Cardinal Cusanus
does further prosecute from another sentence of S. Augustine, wherein he
requires the Potestas Concilij est supra Papam. -- vnd^ Augustinus in epist*

although this Synod was appointed by two Popes, so that at the beginning
thereof it may be held for a lawful Council, yet in the latter part it is to
be accounted no better then a wicked conuenticle, because they refused to obey
the Pope in translating the Synod from Basil unto Ferrara, and after that unto
Florence. But this answer is too calumnious: for in the same Council (recited
by their Surius) Pope Eugenius is recorded to have Responsio Synod^lis ad

time of the Council of Constance, did hold it necessary for the Pope to
submit himself unto a Council (which the Council of Basil from the
testimonies of Fathers did likewis^ conclude, judging every Pope a schismatic
who shall resist it:) how is not that union a schism, which is contrariwise
professed among them at this day? We pass over the diverse schisms which were
in that Church by Anti-popes, when it was hand for any to discern, who was

No wickedness (says he) can be objected against our Popes, which might not
as well have been imputed unto the Priests of the Jewish Synagogue, to whom,
(notwithstanding their impieties,) the people of God did acknowledge
s^biection. This is most true, for it is singular and Pharisaicall wickedness
indeed, to seek a bill of divorce against any Church only for the wicked
manners of the Pastors therein, as has been See above.
shown. But what if any shall not go out, but be put out of that Church by the
Pope unjustly? Dicent aliqui s^ non exisse, s^d ini^st^ repulsos fuisse: quod

50. 5^.
Yet (says he) must not he dissolve the bond of unity with the universal
Church, but in his will and desire affect the union thereof, as S. Cyprian did,
whom Pope Stephen (as much as lay in him) removed from his communion: and also
as the ^ishop Paulinus behaved himself, when he heard that Pope Vrbicus and
his Clergy had, in pride and hatred, denied him Christian fellowship;
notwithstanding both these did* for their parts, affect peace and union. So now
(says Cassander) speaking of Protestants) if they should imitate the modesty
of these ancient Fathers, albeit they be entangled in some errors, and
excommunicated by the Church, yet I could not think them to be dis*united from
that inward fellowship which in mind and heart they do embrace* So he.

36 Here we have it confessed, that there may be a conjunction internal, where
notwithstanding there is an external excommunication, yea even whilst that
the excommunicate persons do continue in the defense of their errors, though
with an opinion that they maintain only a revealed truth. How much more, we
say not excusable, but even justifiable is the cause of Protestants, who are
able to avouch the necessity of their opposition to have been a defense of
truth against novelty of errors? Yea although we shall suppose it to have been
only that one doctrine of Indulgences upon an opinion of a treasury of
satisfactions of the Saints, mixed with Christ's merits for theredemption of
man's soul from punishent after this life: which has been See above lib. 1
cit. 2. Sect. 20. 22.
confessed to be but a new doctrine and deceitful; ought the children of truth
to suffer themselves to be enthralled in any known errors? No, for (as S.
Basil is acknowledged to confess) Quo sane factum est (quemadmodum scribit
Basilius, hist. eccles lib. 4. cap. 17) vt qui sunt in sacris literis educati,
ne vnam q^idem syllaba^ diumotum dogmatum prodi sinant, sed pro illo^um
defensione, si opus sit, nullu^ non mottis genus amplecti parati sint.
Stapleton. orat. de haeres. in genere, annex. lib. de Princip. page 630.
Those who are instructed in holy writ may not betray any one syllable of
divine doctrine, but must be ready rather to undergo any death for the defense
of truth. And what is this different from our Saviors instruction, when he
gave his caveat of avoiding the Matthew. 16.
leaven of the Pharisees, that is, their corrupt doctrine, as it is expounded
by the text?

37 When such doctrines shall be enforced upon men's consciences, as are not
doubtfully, but directly against the word of God, schism in such a case is
passive, not active; and rather a separation from errors, then a schism from
the body, whereunto they are united both in spirit and love, so far as it is
united unto the truth of Christ.

38 And how well the Romanists deserved in that opposition, the foresaid
Cassander will witness: Non negarem tamen multos initio, pio st^dio ad
acriorem reprehensionem quorundam manifestorum abusuum imp^lsos fuisse, and
praecipuam causam hunis calamitatis and distractionis Ecclesiae illis
assignandum, qui inani qnodam fastu Ecclesiasticae potestatis instati, r^cte
and modeste admonentes, superbe and fastidiose contempserunt, and repulerunt.
Quare nullam Ecclesiae firmam pacem sperandam puto, nisi ab ijs initium fiat,
qui distractionis causam dederunt, hoc est, it ij qui Ecclesiasticae
gubernationi praesunt de nimio illo rigore aliquid remittant, and Ecclesiae
paci aliquid concedant; ac multorum piotu^ votis ac monitis obsequentes
manifestos abusus ad regulam diuinarum literarum, and veteris Ecclesiae, a qua
deflexerunt, corrigant. Cassander Consult. art. 7.. De Ecclesia. page 52.
I cannot deny (says he) but that at the first many in godly zeal were moved
vehemently to reprehend certain manifest abuses, and that the chief cause of
this distraction may be imputed unto the governors of the Church, who proudly
and disdainfully contemned those who did both modestly and truly admonish them.
Neither can we hope for a true and solid union, until they, who have given the
c^use of dissension, begin to remit their rigorousnesse, and be contented that
manifest abuses of the Church be reformed according to the direction of
Scripture, and the custom of antiquity, from whence they are departed. We
wish no more, if by abuses we shall understand as well their new doctrines, as
their corrupt constitutions. There remains the tenth position, viz.

That the Protestants are more safe in this division, then the Romanists.
SECT. 10.
39 Nothing has been thought unto some who have M. Tob. M. unto the Bishop of
Chichester: It is an argument borrowed from Bellar. lib. 4. de not is Eccles.
cap. 16. and is here intended by the Apologists.
lately revolted from the Churches of Protestants, a stronger or more sensible
motive, then to think that some Protestants have judged the Roman Church to
be a Church, wherein some souls may be saved, especially seeing that the
Romanists do contrarily adiudge all men of different religion, unto eternal
damnation.

40 But first, these wandering Planets never consider that our Adversaries have
no whit the more truth, because they have less charity, especially seeing that
hereby they as well damn the most graceful Christians of most ancient times,
who (as has been See above.
proved) have sealed the orthodoxe faith with their blood: as they do the
different professors at this day.

41 Secondly, they discern not the impiety of this argument; as for example
(for this one is pregnant,) S. Augustine, though he held the sect of the
Donatists damnable, yet deemed he some of them to be * capable of salvation,
when notwithstanding the Donatists themselves held (as S. Augustine notes)
Donatistae Ecclesiam ex solis justice constare volebant, and inde deducebant
Ecclesiam visibile^ perijsse de orb terrarum, and in sola Africa remansisse,
vt Aug docet de unit. eccles. cap. 12. Bellar. de notis Eccles. cap. 9. Where
he inserreth that Protesiants are of the same opinion. Which is proved to be
false and the difference to be no less then Church visible and invisible, even
by his own confession. See hereafter where the h^resies are objected. Their
presumption was taken from this Scripture, Cant 1. 7. Dic vbi pascis, vbi cubas
in meridie. Vulgar Dona^istarum (...). Iustus Baroniu^ de v^^. Romans Eccles
epist. 48. out of S. Augustine. See ibid.
that the souls of all the men of the world were in the state of perdition,
who were not incorporate in their Church of Afric. Ought therefore the
Catholics have hereupon thus resolved, Ergo to depart from the Catholic
profession, and become Donatists?

42 Thirdly, the Anabaptists exclude Protestants and all different professors
from the hope of spiritual life, who are not of their fantastical anarchie
and confusion: yet do not Protestants judge the state of every Anabaptist to
be so utterly desperate. What then? must therefore all Protestants turn
Anabaptists? No: but every child of truth will follow her, not where
peradventure she may be, but rather where he sees her certain and inviolable
residence and abode; always remembering how that our authors, knowing the
fountain of Gods grace to be bottomless, durst not cover with a stone of
despair the graves of those, who being free from obstinacy in errors, and
from affectation of a stupid ignorance in the necessary mysteries of
salvation, with repentant hearts did die in the faith of Christ; and yet
notwithstanding judged much of that religion in it self damnable, and
accounted it a matter of damnation in themselves, against their conscience to
embrace it: like as we think the plague (when it is in the rage) to be
mortal: and although (by the mercy of God) all die not, who are infected
therewith, yet all who will not tempt God, or do love their own safety, will
not willingly admit of such company, lest they may be infected, and die.

43 Again, Protestants have a more strong fort for their security, whilst
as, besides the evidence of truth in their profession, they hold an inward
unity with all the orthodoxall Churches of ancient times, whom Roman Bishops
secluded from their communion: and with all other Christian professors, who at
this day not prostituting themselves in the filthiness of spiritual
adultery, do not ruinate the principal foundation of faith. Neither can our
Adversaries justly object unto Protestants, obstinacy in their opposition unto
the Roman Church, especially if they shall but call to mind what their own

CHAP. III. Of the faith of King Henry the eight.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
2 Secondly, as concerning now their like confessed examples, we will out of
very many allege only some few. It will not (we think) be denied but that
our late SOVRAIGN^ KING Henry the eight, did after his breach with Rome,
believe and maintain the whole frame and substance of ^ur now professed
Catholic faith, the article of the Popes Primacie only excepted. To which end
their own author Sleidane says of him: Sleydan in English, lib. 13. fol. 174.
a. initio.
He exiled the name of the Bishop of Rome, but kept still his doctrine. And M.
Fox says accordingly: Fox Acts Monum. page 1472. b. fine.
He set forth, and by full consent of Parliament established the book of six
articles containing the sum of Popish religion. And it is evident that he
himself in person, not only as then disputed, Act. Monu. page 530. a. and b.
initio.
but also commanded Act. Monu. page 533. a. circa med.
sentence to be pronounced against Lambert. As also the L. Cromwell read and
Act. Monu. page 533. a.
pronounced that sentence, and at his own death protested himself Act. Mon.
page 598. b. circa med. and see Hollinsheads Chronicle, page 591.
to die in the Catholic faith, not doubting in any article of faith or
Sacrament of the Church, though (says he) many have slandred me to the
contrary. And yet is he commended by M. Fox to die as Act. Monu. Page 598. b.
post med.

King Henry the eight, is by M. Fox affirmed to be a true M. Fulke against

sect. 82. and see D. Humfrey in Iesuitismi, part. 2. rat. 3. page 304. circa
med.
a member of the Catholic Church of Christ.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
TWO things are herein very considerable, to wit, what the Apologists do
grant, and what they deny. They grant that King Henry the eight did disclaim
the article of the Popes Primacie, but deny that he entertained any other
form of substantial doctrine, until the last surrender of his spirit unto
God, except this only article of Papal Primacie. And as though he had
repented him of this opposition, they allege testimonies concerning his
protestation at his death, which neither are to be Their allegatio^ at the
number (7) out of M. Fox and M. Holli^shed, printed Anno 1586. (for they here
name no edition, nor mention him in their catalogue of authors) has not these
testimonies.
found, nor yet (if by Catholic be meant a Romanist) can they agree with other
such histories, which either Protestants or Romanists will approve.

2 Let us allow what the Apologists have said, King Henry excepted against the
Popes Primacie, which he did both in matters temporal (as the acts show) and
also in causes Ecclesiastical, as is plain by the question of divorce. Seeing
then that the name Papist is a denomination of Papa, the Pope, whose supreme
authority over Kings, and infallibility of judgment, in prescribing decrees
unto the Church, are professed at this day by our Adversaries as the two
essential parts of that article of his Primacie, without which they pronounce
all men to be See above.
without hope of salvation: the case is plain, that the King denying Papam,
was nothing less then a Papist.

3 Neither was he alone in this, but the whole state of the land, as well
Ecclesiastical as temporal, consented unto the same renu^ciation of the Popes
supremacy: and therefore could not but be liable unto the same sentence of
excommunication, which Pope Paulus the third published and denounced against
Praeterea sub exco^municationis poena mandamus, ne vllus Princeps Christianus
dicto Henrico Regi Anghae, eius nominis octauo, aut eius fautoribus etc. Bulla
Pauli 3. lib. c^nstitut. Papal. de Pauli 3. Bulla, cap. 2.
King Henry the eight, and all his favorers.

4 But if this had been the only article which the King defended (as the
Apologists avouch) then did the Popes Bull run wild, when in tenor of
excommunication it Insupet Principibus praedictis, alijsque quibuscunque
personis in virtute sanctae obedientiae mandantes, vt aduersus Regem ciusque
fautores, dum in erroribus praedictis permanserint, armis insurgant. Bulla
Pauli 3. quo supra.
commanded the forenamed Princes, and all other persons to take arms against
the King and his favorers, as long as they continued in the foresaid errors.
Belike then this error was not only. Otherwise how could Alphonsus de Castro,
in his preface dedicated unto Philip late king of Spain, have commended his
highness, because Tu curastivt regnum illud (speaking of England) quod plu
quam vigints annos a fide Catholica defecerat, ad ea^dem reduceretur. Alphonsus
a Castro epist. ded^^ ad Phili^ is Regem H^sp. before his w^rkes, Paris. Anno
1578.
after the defection of the kingdom of England, for the space of twenty
years and more, from the Catholic faith, he had again reduced it unto the
same faith, except they shall say that the Popes Primacie is the only article
of their different faith?

5 Again, one of the witnesses, whom they have produced, testifies that K. H.
in his latter times M. Fox Act. Monuman the death of K. Henry 8.
commanded that the people should be instructed concerning the point of
justification, concerning Images, to avoid Idolatry, and all such like
supersitions: and that at the hour of his death he sent for no other Confessor
then M. Cranmer, to receive spiritual comfort from him. Matthew Parker
writes, that by his means Henricus Rex profligato iam Papa, eiecta Monachorum
and fratrum impura turba, tum promulgato per regnum Euangelio, moritur etc.
Matthew. Parkerus antiq. Britan. page 338.
the Papal power was banished, the Monastical srie of impuritie abolished,
the Gospel published: and before his death, he appointed the Earl of
Hereford, whom he had created Duke of Some^set (no Romanist) Tutor to Prince
Edward, and Lord Protector. Finally, Queen Mary after his death would Neque
pro patre Henrico, qui defectionis a Pontifice Romans auctor fuerat, preces
public sieri pasta est Maria. Thuanus hist. lib. 9. Anno 1553. page 971.
not suffer public prayers to be said for his soul, because he died an
excommunicate from the Church. Doubtless if he had had contrition for his
breach with Rome, he would have sought an absolution from some Roman Priest.
They proceed yet further in their personal argument.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
AND why may not Protestants acknowledge S. Bernard for his life a Saint, and
for his doctrine a Lamp? but yet not simply, as unspotted with errors, but
comparatively, or (as the Scripture speaks) in his generation, that is in
respect of the age wherein he lived: when a deluge of iniquity and mist of
superstition had ouer-spread the outward face of the Church.

2 What the height of impiety of his time was, his own confessions and
complaints do sufficiently declare, seeing that by the sight of it (as it may
seem) his friend Verum de Antichristo cum inquirerem quid sentiret, durante
adhuc ea quae nunc est, generatione reuelandum illum esse certissime se scire
protestatus est: -- at sci citanti mihi vnde certitudinem haberet, expone^e

is in nothing more frequent th^n in deploring the malady of the Clergy of his

Herod and Pilate were made friends, and Christ was crucisied; and from the
most bitter bitterness of his soul crying out of the inward and incurable
plague of the Church, and the corruption thereof in manners; the rage whereof
he found to be so violent, that he said (speaking of the Prelates of the
Church) they were Ministers of Christ, but yet served Antichrist. It is a
gracious blessing to be godly, but to be a Lot in Sodom, and a lilly among
thorns, that is, a godly man in a general invasion of all vices, such an one
is glorious, and may well challenge the title of Saint.

3 But the maine question concerns his doctrine, and how S. Bernard * See

darkness of infatuation of his times; but no Sun, for he wanted not his

blessed, yet to charge him with an heresy, and that also pestiferous. Again
if S. Bernard shall but a little impeach the power of their Church, then they
stick not to contemn him, saying, See above.
Say Bernard what he list.

4 And indeed, our Adversaries cannot claim a full interest in S. Bernards

rebuke the worldly Inter hae^ tu Pastor procedis deauratus, tam multa

not publicly and freely to reprove the Pope, although he shall commit some
error which is intolerable, as (for example) in granting of Indulgences.

5 He held the doctrine of the pure conception of the blessed Virgin in the
womb of her mother, and the festiuity of that day, to be Quo (Christo)
excepto, de caetero vniuersos respexit ex Adam natos, quod vnus humiliter de
semetipso ac veraciter consiteretur: In iniquitatibus (inquiens) conceptus sum,
and in peccatis concepit me matter mea. Cum haec ita se habeant, quaenam iam
erit festiuae ratio conceptionis? Quo pacto, inquam, aut sanctus asseretur
conceptus, qui de Spiritu sancto non est, ne dicam, de peccato est, aut fessus
habebitur, qui minime sanctus est? Libenter gloriosa hoc honor carebit, quo
vel peccatum honorari, vel falsa induci videtur sanctitas. Alioquin nulla ei
ratione placebit contra Ecclesiae ^itum praesumpta nouitas, matter temeritatis,
soror supe^stitionis, filia leuitatis. Bernardus epist. 174.
false, new, vain and superstitious: which is now * imposed upon some to be
received under an oath, and is generally professed of our Adversaries, among
whom one of the most ancient Jesuits does for this cause thus answer, Salmeron
Ies. in Romans 5. disp. 51. See above lib. 2. cap. 29. Sect. 2. number. 10. 11.
We say (says he) that all devotion which is due unto the blessed Virgin, did
not rely upon S. Bernard, etc.

6 Our Adversaries now teach a prerogative and freedom of Bishops and the Pope
from the necessary subjection unto the temporal and worldly governors, by
the law of God: but S. Bernard writing unto a Bishop concerning this case, told
him (which is confessed to be likewise the doctrine of other Fathers) that the
order which God has set, is, Omnis anima subiecta sit etc.] Id est, sieve
Propheta, sieve Apostolus, sieve Episcopus, subditus sit. Sequitur Chrysostomum
Euthymius -- and Bernardus ad Episcopum Senonensem idem colligit [Omnis anima]
tum vestra (inquit) quis vos excipit? si quis tentat excipere, tentat decipere.
Epis^. Espenceus comm. in Tit. 3. 1. digress. 10. page 513. Paris. 1568.
that every soul, even of the Apostles, does owe subjection; adding that he
that should endeavor to except him, did indeed but tempt him. And when he
considered the Popedom to swell by reason of the commixture of Popedom and
Princedome, he said freely unto the Pope, that the Apostolis interdicitur
dominatus: ergo tu and tibi vsurpare aude aut dominans Apostolatum, aut
Apostolicus Dominatum. Bernardus lib. 2. de considerat. ad Eugenium, cap. 6.
Apostolic function, and worldly Domination cannot consist together. * See
above.


7 What multitudes of novelties are daily maintained in their Church, is
displaied in every part of this Appeal: but S. Bernard writing unto a Convent
of Abbots, requires such a Council and Reuerendis Abbatibus apud Suessionem
in nomine Domini congregatis, etc. Non me, inqua^, Sanctorum potest earere
conuentus, nec loci ^^rporisue distantia private prorsus a Concilio iustorum and
congregatione. Illo praesertim Consilio, in quo non hominum traditiones
obstmatius desensantur, aut superstitiosius obseruantur: sed diligenter
humiliterque inquiritur, quae sit voluntas Dei bona and beneplacens and
perfecta. Bernardus epist. 91.
congregation, wherein the traditions of men are not obstinately defended, or
superstitiously observed, but which does diligently and humbly enquire what is
the good and perfect will of God. Which sentence how it may cross many Romish
Traditions, may be collected from our other particular treatises.

8 That which does most give life unto the soul of every erroneous professor
(we always except, that his error be not fundamental, or else sinisterly
affected) is the matter of our justification before God: whereunto this lamp
(S. Bernard) did give a great light in the three principal points. First
against the now Romish doctrine of Free Will, he ascribes the whole original
power of good in the consent of the will, unto Non quod vel ipse consensus ab
ipso sit -- facit volentem, hoc est, volunt^ti suae consentientem. -- Non
partim g^atia, partim liberum arbitrium, sed torum quidem hoc, and totum illa;
sed vt totum in illo, sic totum ex illa. Bernard. de great. and lib. arb. and in
other sentences of that book.
grace: secondly, when he preached the necessity of good works, as being the
Kings high way unto life everlasting, yet did he disclaim all confidence of
his own Fateor non sum dignus, nec proprijs meritis possum regnum obtinere

merit, and judged good works to be no proper Si proprie appellentur ea merita,

cause of salvation, no not eue^ now when he was in the state of regeneration,
but reposed his soul in the imputative justice, (which is without man) even
the merit of Christ, as in the all-sufficient satisfaction: Lastly, he
accounts no better of men's best actions, as they proceed from man, then of a

9 We may not omit the confidence which he teaches every penitent to have,
that Si credis peccata tua non posse deleri, nisi ab eo, etc. -- sed add adhue

perhibet in cord nostro Spiritus sanctus dicen^, Dimis^a sunt tibi peccata

his sins are remitted unto him. So that for these aboue-mentioned respects
(although there were no more) the Protestants might hold S. Bernard worthy of
the foresaid denominations, without any great prejudice unto their cause. By
this provocation we are constrained to deliver another position, viz.

That Protestants in their lives, have deserved the name of sanctity; which is
tried by the censures of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
10 Cardinal Bellarmine is wonderful censorious: In Ecclesia Catholica sunt
plurimi mali, ex haereticis (speaking of Protestants) nullus est bonus. Bellar.
lib. 4. de Eccles. milit. cap. 13.. Quod vero.
There are many wicked among us Catholics (says he,) but among Protestants
there is not one good. How shall this appear? For first their Jesuit
Maldonate confesses an outward practice of Caluinistae ouina pelle induti,
nihil enim in eorum ore nisi Pater noster coelestis, nisi Christus, nisi fides,
iuramentum inauditum, nihil in eorum factis apparebat nisi eleemosynae, nisi
temperantia, nisi modestia. He adds, Ex fructibus homines cognouerunt non
natiuam hanc, sed apposititiam* fuisse pellem (but shows not how.) Maldonat*
Ies. in Matthew. 7. 15.
praying, alms, temperance, modesty, abstaining from oaths, among
Protestants; which he (not able to prove it) calls the sheeps skin, and
wolves covering.

11 Secondly, their Jesuit Coster testifies of them, that Edunt illi quidem
nonnunquam bona mo^alia, largiuntur eleemosynas, xenodochia erigunt, moderanter
quidam eorum viuunt, a conuiuijs, and ^uram^ntis sese abslinent: -- haec sunt
externa officia. Costerus Ies. Enchirid. cap. 2. De Ecclesia, page 101.
they give alms, build hospitals, live moderately etc. which (says he) are
outward offices. And are they not also Christian duties?

12 Thirdly, their Jesuit Salmeron obiecting to himself this doubt, Habent
(speaking of Protestants, when they began to renoiece the Romish superstitions)
multos sequaces, qui eorum disciplinam amplectuntur in tam exiguo te^poris
interuallo: Dei ergo opus esse videtur, qui non permitteret tam multos haeresi
deceptos interire. Respo^demus, -- Neque mirum est, multos in eoru^ casses
incide^e, quia peccata nostra, and daemonis potestas, and adulationes omnibus
omnium hominum, etiam peccatorum, generibus adhibitae magna vi eloquentiae, and
praetextu Scripturae, in causa sunt, vt quibusdam persuadeant; quia induti
vestes onium, and malam nostram vitam cernentes, and eoram alijs vrgentes, and
successionem primitiuae Ecclesiae sibi affingentes, multum possunt ad
persuasionem apud eos, qui Scripturas, sanctos patres non legunt, aut non
diligenter inspiciunt. Salmeron Ies. comm in Epist. B. Paul^, lib. 1. part 3.
disp. 10. page 235.
How shall the religion of the Protestants not be thought to be from God,
seeing it had so many professors in so short a time? does answer, that it is no
marvel, alleging, among other reasons, because (says he) they cover
themselves with sheeps clothing, and do behold the wickedness of our lives.
Which cannot but argue, at least, an outward holiness. We therefore demand of
their Cardinal, How he will have man judged? If by the sight into men's inward
souls? then shall they never be able to prove any man without a Miracle to be a
Saint. But if the examination of their outward behauiours be sufficient
arguments, why did he pronounce, that among Protestants there is not one good,
and yet did acknowledge so many outward works of godliness? Among whom Luther
is observed by Erasmus, to have been of so great Luther^ vita omnium horum
consensu probatur, id non leave praeiudicium est, tantam esse morum
integritatem, vt nec hosts reperiant quod calumnientur. Erasmus in Epist. ad
Thomam Episc. Eborac.
integrity of life, that his enemies could not take any exceptions against
him: and Hierome of Prague, who was burnt at the time of the Council of
Constance, is commended (by their Orator Poggius) for learning and godliness,
and in that respect exorned with this Encomium, Hieronymus Pragensis (in Conc.
Constantiensi) incredibile dictu est, quibus se tueretur argumentis; nihil
vnquam protulit indignum viro bono etc -- vitam luam and studia exposuit,

Poggius Florentinus Orator in epist. ad Leonardum Aretinum, vt habetur in

O man, worthy of the everlasting memory of men.

13 By which our Christian reader may take an argument of discerning of
spirits, whether side do deal more ingenuously and sincerely, the Protestants,
who acknowledge virtue in their Adversaries; or the Romanists, who, lest any
might acknowledge as much in Protestants, command their memories to be
abolished; as namely, where they find these words, the godly Doctor Luther,
allow the book, but command those words to be In Iohanne Funccio haec verba

stand, but Supprimatur nomen Caluini, and ponatur studiosus quidam. Ibid. page
124.
the name of Calvin must be suppressed, and in stead thereof shall be written,
a certain godly man said so. Let these plagiaries learn what that saying of
Christ means, Matthew. 11. 19.
Wisdom (wheresoever) is justified of her children; and then it will,
doubtless, appear, that Protestants are the true children of this Mother,
because they are willing to call good good, in whomsoever they find it.

SECT. 1.
WE may answer, that neither can this Treatise be truly called brief, which is
enfarced with so many and needless repetitions; neither yet are the examples
certainly undoubted, seeing that (as has been shown) there was not an

for some outward respect, to justify a sinner: nor is there any Iam. 1.
shadow of change in the almighty, not to be the same God of justice and
mercy that ever he has been: but because even the godly men are not of equal
perfection, nor their doctrines of the same metal, but differ (as the 1. Cor.
3. 12.
Apostle says) as gold, silver, precious stones, timber, hay, stubble; there
is constant justice in God to condemn their errors, and unchangeable mercy to
pardon their persons; as our Adversaries themselves stand compellable to
confess in S. Bernard, in whom their own Castro noted and confuted (as he
calls it,) a See before in the last chapter, Sect. 1. lit. c.
pernicious heresy.

Gods promise which reaches unto a thousand generatious: for by this reason
the children of Turks, and (as M. Hooker says) M. Hooker ibidem.
all the world may be baptized, in so much as no man is a thousand descents

promises of their doctrine) by themselves practiced and holden good, though (as
M. D. Some affirms M. Some in his foresaid defense, etc. cap. 22. page 165.
and 167.
to Penrie) they were the children of popish West-Indians, whose other former
ancestors never knew the Christian faith, and though (says he) those
West-Indians M. Some ibidem, p. 167.
were baptized by popish shauelings, yet they received true baptism, and were
ingraffed into Christ, and for this reason, because there is a Church in
popery: for (says he) M. Some ibid. p. 149. post med. says: And Amandus
Polanus in part. Theology. page 305. post med says: Hodierna Ecclesia Romana

If there were no Church at all in popery (then) the Infants of papists were
not to be baptized in any reformed Church. By which premises of their confessed
practice it appears, 1 that the children of Catholic (or popisb) Parents are
to be baptized, 2 as being comprehended within the covenant of eternal life: 3
and that by reason of their parents faith: so evidently in their doctrine and
practice, is the faith of the Catholic (or popish) parents, holden for

unrelenting adversaries? (u) In the propositions and principles, etc. vbi

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THis reason is wrought with excellent subteltie, and is indeed the most
specious objection that can be found in their whole book: the connection
whereof may be thus comprised. If Romish children be within the covenant of
grace, by reason of the faith of their parents, then the parents themselves are
within that covenant, and in the state of salvation; and consequenly the Romish
doctrine is confessed by Protestants to be the Catholic and saving faith.
Which conclusion is thus made contrary unto the intention of the alleged
authors, contrary unto the instance which may be taken from our Adversaries
their own doctrine, and contrary to the light of common experience. First,

2 All the Protestant authors aboue-cited, distinguish the state of the
children of the Pagane and infidel parents from the children of all sects of
Christians, whether they be Papists or Anabaptists, or whatsoever other
heretics, if that the parents themselves have been once by baptism, in the
faith of the holy Trinity, dedicated unto Christ: by virtue of the which
covenant and stipulation with God (wherein the children of all Christians are
comprised) it comes to pass, that the child is only interested in that part
of the covenant, which is sound and Catholic; whilst as the parents
themselves stand guilty of heresies, which by their own proper and actual
consent, they have added unto the truth.

3 Now then the Apologists by their inference from their alleged confessions
of Protestants, have gained no more advantage then the Anabaptists, or (if they
be not fundamentally heretical) then other heretics may obtain. Thus is this
threede broken, which they have so curiously and artificially spunne. But yet,
because of their great confidence which they six upon this speculation, we owe
them a second satisfaction from their own Principles.

4 For, Cardinal Tolet thinks it a matter probable, that in some case b
Baptismi minister necessitatis -- potest esse homo cuiuscunque vitae, sieve
Iudaeus, sieve Paganus, sieve alius quiuis infidelis, etc. -- tamen omnibus est
necessaria intentio debita faciendi id, quod facit Ecclesia, vti diximus, Vnde,
licet infidelis non crederet se quicquam boni facere, and cum irrisione
faceret, si tamen ad petitionem baptizandi baptizaret, intendens facere id quod
facit Ecclesia Christiana -- vere baptizaret. Tolet. Ies. Instruct. Sacerd.
lib. 2. cap. 20. page 377, 378.
an An praecisus, qualis est haereticus aut schismaticus, possit absoluere in
articulo mortis? Si casus accideret, quod non esset periculum desperationis,
aut seductionis, non est improbabile quod affirmant, -- posse, nempe, absolui
ab haeretico aut schismatico, quando scandalum non esset. Communis tamen opinio
est in contrarium. Tolet. Ies. Instruct. Sacerd. lib. 1. ca. 15.. Sexto non.
heretic or a schismaticke may give absolution: but they will not say, that
any Pagane or infidel can absolve any sinner. Here then we see that the pa^tie
absolved receives grace and remission of sin, and yet the absoluer, being an
heretic, does still persist in the state of damnation. We demand, whence is
it, that the absolution becomes so effectual to the absolved? is it only by
the power of his own faith, or the outward form of words? So the absolution
made by a Pagane should have been as effectual, as that which was performed by
an heretic. They must therefore confess some ability in an heretic, (not as
he is an heretik, but as he is a Christian,) by virtue whereof the absolution is
made sovereign unto him that receives it: and consequently grant, that a man
may be cause of saving health unto another by that his faith, which by reason
of his admixture of heresy, is damnable unto himself.

5 What shall we say of another Principle, which is general in their Church?
viz. In the case of necessity, if a Pagane shall baptize one, it is a perfect
baptism, although it be done in scorn; always provided, that in baptizing,
he have an intention to do that which the Christian Church does. Mark, here is
a case of necessity, which is in the behalf of the soul of a child, where a
Pagan is held to be a sufficient Minister of this sacrament; yet so, that he
have a Christian intent: which does fully contradict the Apologists
consequence. For here, by their own doctrine, the intent of a Pagan is
auailable for the working of saving grace unto the baptized, which intent of
the Pagan is damnable to himself.

6 Common experience, especially in other nations, does tell us, that if a man,
who is an infranchised or naturalized subject, shall run headlong into any
actual rebellion, and in this transgression shall beget a son, this child,
by the virtue of the fathers first naturalization, shall enjoy the benefit of a
subject, and inherit his fathers lands. Wherein we may observe that the fathers
first infranchisement is available for the good of the child, which (by reason
of his own act of rebellion) becomes unprofitable, nay deadly unto himself.
So the character of the true Baptism of Christ, wherein an heretical father
was dedicated unto God, may establish his seed in the state of perfect
Christianity, even by virtue of that root, which was the faith of the blessed
Trinity, and abrenuntiation of all error and wickedness; whereby there does
accrue a greater measure of judgment unto the father himself, because of his
actual apostasy from simplicity of the holy faith. Notwithstanding all this
our discourse, we wish our reader to enquire into the testimonies objected from
protestants, and try when they said, that children borne of Christian parents
are in the state of grace: whether some meant, or else ought to have
understood, according to the judgment of some ancients, that such children
were Candidati Baptismi, that is, had a ius and right unto Baptism; which is
common also unto the children of Turks, but as they are adopted or brought up
by Christians in their families, as it was in the family of Abraham, where
strangers bought with money, and their children, by reason of the covenant of
circumcision, were called his Seed.

CHAP. VII. Of the Romish change in the points of Religion, which is the
principal question of this dispute following.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.

premises, we do presume hereby most humbly to submit to your MAIESTIHS most
learned judgment this brief discourse had thereof in the two sections next

follows, that if the Roman Church have not sithence changed her religion,
then she still retains and persisteth in the right faith.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
WE willingly join issue, and if we cannot prove that the Roman Church has
in many weighty points of religion degenerated from her self, then shall we
no more decline from her as from a malignant step-dame, but devoutly yield unto
her all due acknowledgement, as unto a mother Church. We must desire our reader
then to expect a full evidence and plain proof hereof, after that we have
first removed those rubbes which the Apologists have cast in our way, by
manifold objections, as first questioning,

Whether Pope Victor made any change by his claim of authority over other
Churches.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Now as touching her supposed change; we will briefly examine what our learned
adversaries (who have purposely and seriously labored in discovery or proof
of this pretended change) do most materially object in that behalf. 1 First

answer to a counterfeit Catholic page 36. post med.
the first (says M. Whitaker, and M. Fulke) that exercised jurisdiction upon
fort^aine Churches was Victor: whereto we answer (as does the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury concerning woman's Baptism) saying to M. Cartwright: M. Whitgift in
his defense, page 510 prope sinem.
You say in the margent that Victor Anno. 198. did first appoint that women
might baptize, by this you do add more credit to the cause, then you are aware
of; for Victor was a godly Bishop and Martyr, and the Church at that time was
in great purity, as not being long after the Apostles.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
2 This first point is indeed very material; for the act of Victor being
rightly pondered, will prove (that we may so speak) fatal and prejudicial to
the now Romish claim of Primacie: which disadvantage this their preoccupation
(taken from the speech of the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury) can no way
prevent; for in the same objected place he further professed, saying, Page 509.
I go not about to confirm the baptism of women: plainly signifying that his
intendment was not by that answer to make the authority of Victor any rule of
Christian resolution. But what else?

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Whereto we further add, that whereas Victor in the example now urged, did
upon occasion The occasion hereof, was that the Churches of Asia minor had
received of S. John the Evangelist to observe our Lords Pasch or Easter day not
always upon Sunday, but with the Jews (in regard of their known weakness)
upon the 14 of the Moon, as in like sort upon the same ground was for the time
tolerated, Circumcision, Acts 16. 3. and abstinence from blood, and that which
is strangled, Acts 15. 20. The Bishops of Rome (who had received of S. Peter
and Paul the other manner, did accordingly tolerate the Churches of Asia, till
such ti^e as thae certain of them in Asia made this their obseru^tion
necessary, in so much that the other manner was condemned by the l^daizing
heretic Blastui. Tertullian de praescript. circa finem: and Centur. 2. c. 5.
col. 107. l. 12. Hereupon Victor though^ good to tolerate them no longer, and
therefore prescribed the Bishops of Asia to be excommunicated, unless they
conformed themselves to the Latin Church in the observation of ^aster day.
then seeming very sl^nder The Churches of Asia not denying the feast of
Easter, but differing only from the Roman Church in the day on which it
should be kept, wherein also they had (as they presumed) the forementioned
example and tradition of S. John for their warrant, thought this no ^ust cause
of excommunication.
excommunicate the Bishops of Asia, wherein (says M. Fulke) M. Fulke in his
answer to a counterfeit Catholic, page 36. post med.
he passed the bounds of his authority, howsoever the Bish^ps ^f Asia (in
respect of the said occasion seeming to them so slender) censured Victor as
over severe; ^useb hist. lib. ^. cap. 23, and 24.
yet (which is most to be observed) no one of them (though thus in their own
opinion provoked,) charge him (as in all reason if they might they would)
with any undue claim or exercise of usurped authority: Eusebius. hist. lib. 5.
cap. 24. initio, reports how Irenaeus who thought Victor over sharp herein,
^dmonisheth Victor by letters that he would not for the observation of a
tradition so long used, quite cut off so many Churches fr^^ the body of the
universal Church: In which words he does not so much impugn as plainly
acknowledge his authority: for h^^ could Victor so cut them off, unless he
had authority therein?
even Irenaeus himself (who stood most herein) acknowledges so plainly
elsewhere the Primacie of the Roman See, that he is therefore specially
reprehended Centur. 2. c. 4. col. 64. l. 10. it is said, Nouitatem (...)

3 True it is, that the Asian Bishops did observe the time of Easter according
unto the custom of the Jews, but yet not according unto the Jewish intention,
that is, as necessarily bound to that time by the law of Moses, as the De eo
(Blasto) scribens Tertullianus, sic ait: Blastus accedens latenter Iudaismum
vult introducere: Pascha enim dicit non aliter custodiendum esse, nisi ex lege

Apostolical Tradition from S. John, as here is confessed: nor yet did they
schismatically, with Cum igitur Blastus eius rei causa iam schisma conflasset,
etc. Baronius Cardin. Tom. 2. Anno 198. number. 16.
Blastus, condemn all other Churches, which did not celebrate the feast of
Easter at the same 14. day of the month; but, notwithstanding this difference
of rites concerning the observation of Easter, did persist in the unity of
faithful fellowship and love with all orthodoxall Christians. But Pope Victor
began to thunder against Christians, and adventure to excommunicate those holy
Bishops of Asia, when he became himself an author of that schism, and (as our
Doctor has said) passed the bounds of his authority.

4 The argument which they oppose hereunto is very pithlesse: for See above
lib. 2. cap. 22. largely discussed.
among those Asian Bishops, (as has been confessed) the famous Polycrates
would not be dissuaded, but said that he was not dismayed with the terror of
the excommunication of Pope Victor: and other Bishops commanded Victor to seek
concord and peace: and notwithstanding his excommunication, kept their ancient
custom, according as they had decreed in a Council. And not this only, but
At illi (Asiani) omnes cum nonnullis alijs Praesulibus, non solum huic manus
minime praebuerunt, verumetiam pertinaciae redarguerunt. Massonius ibid.
verbis. seqq.
the same Asians, and other Bishops reproved the Pope of obstinacy. Can any
require a better argument of their condemning of the Popes usurped authority,
then is their contemning his excommunication as a puff of pride? or any
greater derogation from the transcendencie of his judgment, then to contradict
his constitution by a contrary decree in a Council? This shows that all
those Asians, who in those purest times of the Church neglected that
excommunication, which is the greatest thunderbolt that the Pope can send
forth, were nothing less then Popish.

5 In the objection out of Irenaeus, we have See before, lib. 2. cap. 23. Sect.
1. and 2.
already observed, both that the witnesses whom they produce, have been
wronged by their allegation, and that the Father Irenaeus himself has much
disabled their pretense.

Fulke in his answer to a counter^^t Catholic, page 37. circa medium.
challenging (says M. Fulke) Prerogative over the Bishops in Africa by
forging a false Canon of the Nicene Council. Whereto we answer: that the
former example of Victor who lived about some 200. years before these, fully
auoideth this objection: for if Victor so long before them challenged primacie,
then did they but continue it, and not first bring it in; As for the suspicion
The suspision which Protestants en^orce was this: Zozimus, Bonifa^e and
Celestinus, to prove unto the Bishops of Africa appeals unto Rome, alleged in
behalf thereon the Nicene Council: whereupon says M. Jewel in the fourth
article of his Reply, The said African Bishops wrote unto the (...) of the East
to set their copies of the Nicene Council: upon return of which copies from
Cyril Bishop of Alexandria and A^ticus of Constantinople, there appeared
therein no such Canon: As also (say they) neither in the 22 Canons set down by
Ruffinus (hist. l. 10. c. 6.) does any such Canon appear, whereupon
Protestants urge this to have been a forgery and ^n^ ouation in Zozimus,
Boniface and Celestinus.
of pretended forger^ of the Canons of the Nicene Council by Zozimus,
Boniface, and Celestinus, it is both untrue Untrue, for between the time of
the Nicene Council and of the foresaid Bishops, Cyril of Alexandria, and
Atticus of Constantinople, the Arrians had occupied those sees, whereof see
Socrates l. 2. Zozom. l. 4. Theodoret. l. 2. and Niceph. l. 9. and 10.) and
corrupted the true originals of the Nicene Council, so as the Canons which
Ruffinus sets down and which Cyril and Atticus sent (howsoever those
Fathers thought of then^ were fal^e and corrupted, which to be true, appears
many ways: 1. First, in that sundry ancient Fathers have alleged sundry
Canons of the Nicene Council, which are not to be found in these: As for
example An brose ep. 82. says, It was decr^^^ in the Nicene Council, Ne big
amus in clerum asciscatur. S. Austine ep. 110. says, It was there decreed, Ne
Episc^pus sibi succes^rem sufficiat. Hieron. in praefat. Judith, says
concerning the book of Judith: Hunc librum Synodu^ Nicena in nun (...)
sanctarum Scripturarum legitur computasse. And the Fathers of the second
general Council of Constantinople (which was 30 years before Zozimus) in
their synodicall letters written to the Bishops of Italy, Damasus and others,
extant in Theodoret hist. l. 5. c. 9. post medium, affirm that there was
sanctorum Patrum in Concilio-Niceno decisio, vt videlicet singularum
Pro^inciarum antistites vna cum finitimis (modo ipsis ita visum suerit

collection, and a great part thereof specially recited and alleged verbatim by
Sozomen hist. l. 3. c. 7. and whereof see Socrates hist l. 2. c. 11.) says,
Canonibus in Nicena Synodo iubentibus, non debere praeter sentent^^ Romani
Pontificis concilia celebrari. And Socrates affirms accordingly that such a
Canon was, hist. l* 2. c. 5 and that it was alleged by Julius hist. l. 2* c.
13. and so likewise does Zozomen hist. l. 3. c. 9. also it is notorious and
most certain, as appears by Athanasius in epistola de synodis Armini and
Seleuci, and by Eusebius de vita Constantini. l. 3. c. 5. 17. and 18. and by

concerning appeals to Rome. 3. ^astly, the Aphricans (whom this matter most
concerned) were so far from charging the said Popes with innovation or
forgery* that S. Austine one of them calls Zozimus the most blessed Pope

Conuenticle against Athanasius, mentioned by Zozomen hist. l. 3. c 10. and

impertinent.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
Showing the matter of this accusation, from the confession of our Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
HOW shall the example of Victor support the causes of other Popes, which has
been found to be unable to stand of it self? We come unto the accusation of
the Popes false pretense of a Canon for the authorizing of their power of
Appeals, which imputation their Apologists did promise to See above l. 2. cap.
22.
avoid, and now is it put unto the trial. The brief of this business (as it
is set down in the book of the Council by their own Surius) is this:

sent their Legates unto the Greek Patriarchs of Antioch, Alexandria, and
Constantinople, by whose help they might consult with the ancient copies and
records, for trial whether there had been any such Canon enacted in the Nicene
Council, or not. After due examination performed herein, they are informed by
express letters from Rescripta Cyrill^. Page 589. col. 2.
Cyril Patriarch of Alexandria, and from I pistola Attici. Ibid.
Atticus Patriarch of Constantinople, of the ancient copies, wherein the
alleged Canon could not be found.

2 This being understood, the Fathers of the foresaid Council (amongst whom S.
Subscri^ serunt Alip^us, -- and Augustinus, etc. P^g* 58^ col. 2.
Augustine was a principal one) did entreat the Bishop of Rome N^c. a nebis
excommunicatos, etc. Page 590 col. 2.
not to admit again of any excommunicate persons into his communion, because
as your Reverence (say they) may perceive, it is so decreed by the Council of
Nice, arguing the equity thereof from this common rule of experience;
Prudentissime enim, etc. Page 591. c^l. 1.
because (say they) all such matters may be most discreetly and indifferently
ordered in the provinces where they are begu^. And lest any might object the
supremacy of the Pope, they thus preoccupate in their epistle unto the Pope:
Nisi to^te quisquam est, qui credat vincui^ibet posse Deum examinis inspirare
iustitiam, and innumerabilibus Sacerdotibus in Concilium congregatis denegare.
Page 591. col. 1.
Except any shall peradventure think (say they) that God will inspire some one
with the spirit of wisdom and justice, and deny that grace unto many
assembled together in one Synod for determination of such causes. And in
conclusion, they judge Aut quomodo ipsu ^n t^ansmarinum iudicium rat^m erit?

the Pope should challenge it) a Executores Clenco v^stros nolite mittere,

smokie arrogancy.

3 This is the true process of that Council: hence it is that Protestants
have imputed unto those Popes both matter of forgery, and of innovation. This
is an old sore, and has bin often rubbed: we now must try the virtue of the
salve which they have plaistered upon it: it is compounded of two observations,
first they would show that this accusation is false, and secondly that it is
impertinent; both which in their marginal notes are more largely prosecuted.
Therefore we must try first

Whether the accusation made against the forenamed Popes for forgerie be
false, or no?
SECT. 2.
4 The general exception, which the Apologists do take against the truth of
this accusation, is by imagining (as they have been instructed by two Bellar.
lib. 2. de Romans Pont. c. 25. and Baron. Tom 5. Anno 419. number. 80.
Cardinals) that because histories report, that the Arian Heretics occupied
those Sees in Grecia, therefore those copies Apologists at the letter (c.)
were by them corrupted, howsoever (say the Apologists) those Fathers thought
of them. The Fathers, who are confessed to have thought otherwise, were such,
whose names have been always honorable in Gods Church, for their orthodoxall
profession and glorious victories against the Arian faction, to wit, Cyril
Patriarch of Alexandria, who called the foresaid copies Necesse habui --
fidelissima exemplatia ex authentica Synodo in Nicaea Bithyniae habita, vestrae
charitati dirigere. Surius Tom. 1. Rescript Cyrilli Alexand. page 589.
most faithful examples taken out of the authentike Synod of Nice; and
Atticus Patriarch of Constantinople, who nam^th them the Sicut statuta sunt in

apud Surium quo supra, page 589. col. 1.
Authentical examples were extant (if any where) in those Churches of Greece,
and therefore sent to be satisfied in the truth from thence: and after that
they had received them, they held it a matter Quis enim dubitet exemplaria esse

locis and de nobilibus Graecis Ecclesijs adlata and comparata concordant. Ib.

without all doubt, that they were the authentike and perfect copies; because
those Greek Bishops were taken from the most noble Churches in Grecia: and the
rather for that they being severed one from another by so great a distance, did
notwithstanding join and accord in their evidence. Furthermore certifying the
Pope, that all other examples, whether Quanquam plurimos codices legeremus, sed

themselves did suggest,) did want the surmised Canon: whereunto Ruffinus and

consent.

5 And shall we now dare, for the defense of one Romish example, to set so
light by, and to nullify so many copies of so different Provinces, received
from so noble Authors, acknowledged with so universal a consent? This
sufficiently bewraieth the irreuerence which our Adversaries have unto true
antiquity. It is necessary that this be done upon some good, and more then
probable reason. We come to this trial, and deliver

A confutation of the reasons, which have been used by the Apologists in
impugning of the former accusation: even from the confessions of our learned
Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
6 They have polished their margent with a multitude of objections, to prove
that the Arrians had corrupted the Originals: and their chief argument is,
because that sundry ancient Fathers have alleged diverse Canons of the
Council of Nice, which are not found in the forenamed copies of that
Council. Whereunto we answer by a distinction, acknowledged and published by
their own Jesuit Pisanus, who observes out of a Greek Author, that Idem
Graecus author noster duo Decretoru^ genera in Synodo Nicaena constituta fuisse
refert, praeter fidei declarationem, and Arij excommunicationem: Primum
Decretoru^ genus ipse Diatyposes vocat, nos constitutiones dicere possumus, sed
maluimus Graecu^ nomen retinere, and diatyposes appel lare. In eisofficia

There were two kind of Decrees used in the Nicene Council, the one called
Diatyposes, Constitutions, the other named (...), which we call Canons, which
concerned Ecclestasticall discipline: we know not (says he) the number of
their Constitutions, which that Authors says were few; and the book of the
greek Author, viz. G^lasius Cysicenus, has been lately Haec Alphon^us

translated by Balforeus (in the judgment of the Jesuit Posseuine) a
Catholic.

7 This distinction between Constitutions and Canons thus standing, the
objections, which are here made, are presently refuted, because the contention
between the Africanes and the Popes of Rome was concerning Canons, and our
Adversaries instances are about Constitutions and Acts, which are to be
discerned from the Canons properly so called, and were but twenty.

8 This collection agrees with the judgment of their own Jesuit Turrian
(taken from Balsamon,) where speaking of the time of the celebration of Easter,
(both which are here objected by the Apologists, as recorded in the true Canons
of the Council of Nice,) he grants that they are Ad eadem acta referendi
sunt Nicaeni Canones de generibus non ordinandorum, de poenitentibus in Epist.
6. Innocentij ad Agapetum Macedonium, and de alijs in Epist. ad Synod.
Toletanam, and de Bigamis in Epist. Ambrosij 82. and siqui alij sunt, de quibus
authors meminerunt. Turrianus ibid. verb. seqq.
not found in the Canons of that Council, but in the Acts: and unto the same
Acts (says he) are to be referred those (so calling them improperly and
vulga^ly, as he himself signifies) Canons, which concern the ordination of
Ministers, or other such like, which are mentioned by other Authors, viz. in
the name of the proper Canons of the Council of Nice.

objections to be crooked and indirect, wherein Constitutions, or improper
Canons, are alleged in stead of them, which were publicly registered in
ancient Monuments for the proper and undoubted Canons of the Nicene Synod. The
second objection is, to prove that the whole book of Judith was held for
Canonical in that Council by the judgment of S. Hierome, as is affirmed by
these Apologists, by Cardinal Ob. Judith, objected by Bellar. lib 1. de verbo

The confutation of their second exception, concerning the impertinencie of the
foresaid accusation of forgerie: from the confessions of our learned
Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
11 For the proof of this impertinencie, the Apologists in their marginall
notes, tell us of two Councels of Sardis, one Heretical, and another
Catholicall: by which latter the foresaid Canon of Appeals to Rome was
decreed. For confirmation whereof they produce Calvin, as one thinking that
the Popes did not forge, but only mistake it, by alleging this decree of
Sardis, as a decree of the Council of Nice. Hence issues their conclusion; So
clear (say they) hereby it is, that Zozimus, Boniface, and Celestine (three
Popes) were no innouators.

12 We crave their patience to give us leave in the examination hereof, to
consult not only with the relaters of (as will appear) doubtful and confused
stories, but with the most subtle discussers thereof. Now then, unto whom does
this last refuge, concerning the Canon of a Catholic Council of Sardis, seem
to be so clear? Does M. Calvin so esteem of it? He is so far from
lessening the suspicion of this dealing, by calling it only a mistaking, that
he names it Qua in re flagitiosa ipsius Romani Pontificis impudentia apparuit
nam cum fraud Sardicensem Synodum pro Nicaena supposuisset, turpiter in
manifesta falsitate deprehensus fuit. Calvin in the place alleged by the
Apologists, signifying not any Catholic, but the heretical Sardis: for if he
had understood any Catholic Sardis, then indeed he might have called it a
mistaking, and not a forgery.
a detestable impudency, and the Pope (as Cardinal Bellarmine confesses of
him) Alterum argumentum Magdeburgenslum, and Caluini eiusmodi est: -- Romani
Pontifices -- discussa causa, falsatores and corruptores Nicaenorum Canonum
deprehensi sunt. Bellar. lib. 2. de Romans Pont. cap. 25.. Alterum igitur.
a falsifier and corrupter of the Canons of Nice.

13 But has this been evident unto all later Romanists? Their Cardinal
Cusanus would be heard speak: Sardicense Conc. fuit per legatos Apostolicae se
dis in Affric. Synodo false allegatum. -- Verum Patres Africani Conc. --
constitutionem illam (quam Gratianus Sardicensi Council. ascribit) scribunt
nulla Patrum Synodo se inuenisse constitutam. Quare satis poss^t dubita^i, an
Sardicensis Conc. constitutio existat. Card. Cusanus lib. 2. Concord. cap. 25.
It may be well doubted (says he) whether there be any such Canon of Sardis
extant. Or will this prove clear by their now Doctors and Jesuits? Verius est
quod idem reuerendiss. Cardinalis in lib. 2. de Romans Pont. cap. 21. 25. and
post eum illustrissimus Cardinalis, anno 347. tradunt, Sardicensium Conciliorum

alterum spurium ab Arianis Philippoli celebratum, ementito nomine Sardicense
appellatum. Binius Annot. in Conc. Sardic. page 439. col. 2.
There were two Councels named Sardis, the one celebrated by Catholic
Bishops, the other by Arian heretics. Thus says their Cardinal Baronius,
Cardinal Bellarmine, and their Binius: yet notwithstanding has Bellarmine
himself (as Binius notes) confounded these two, making them but Reuerendiss.
Card. Bella^minus cap. 7. lib. 1. Conc. scribit hoc Conc. partim confirmatum,
partim reprobatum esse, quia ex 376. Episcopis, Sardicae congregatis, pars
mayor fidem Catholicam Nicaeni Conc. confirmauerat: -- ex ijsdem vero
septuaginta sex reliqui Orientales Episcopi Arianam fidem scripserint. Binius
ibid.
one Council divided into two parts and factions; a greater, which consisted
of 376. Catholic Bishops, and the lesser, wherein there was to the number of
76. And for these two respects, this Council (says he) is partly allowed, and
partly rejected.

14 Let us ascend higher, and seek our evidence from the Africane Bishops, and
the Popes of Rome in the days of S. Augustine, and then indeed the case will
be found clear. Augustious non agnoscit aliud Conc. Sardicense, quam quoddam
haereticum Orientalium, -- Catholicum non vidit. Bellar. lib. 2 de Romans Tont.
cap. 25.. Add quod.
S. Augustine (says Cardinal Bellarmine) did not acknowledge that there was
any Council of Sardis, except that, which is judged of all men to have been
heretical; and the godly Bishops in the Council of Afric are confessed to
have been See hereafter lit. n.
ignorant of any orthodoxall Council of Sardis. Finally, it is so well known,
that the Popes of Rome (when in that Council they had pleaded by their Legates
for the right of Appeals) See hereafter lit. i.
did not so much as name the Council of Sardis for proof of their title in
that behalf.

15 If the matter be not yet cleared, it will become more sensible by (as it
were) an Antiperistasis, even the sight of the mist and cloud of our
Adversaries answer, whereby they seek to darken the truth, whilst they call
the Synod of Sardis an Sardicense erat Conc. Oecumenicum, -- quod matores
plenarium Concilium appellauerunt: Ita August. epist. 162. Ecce putemus etc. --
Missi sunt Legati Sardicam ad Concilium a Iulio. Baronius Anno 347. number. 7. and
10.
Oecumenicall or general Council, authorized by Pope Julius, and moderated by
his Legates: and yet their Cardinal Baronius confesses (even At quod nos in

not without wonder and astonishment) that the Popes for the defense of their
claim, did not allege any Canon of the Sardican Council, but only the Canon
of the Council of Nice: and then to free them from Nulla in his de dolo malo

verbis seqq.
suspicion of forgerie, answers (only by an imagination) that either some
Canons of the Nicene Council, which were repeated in the Council of Sardis,
were lost in the Greek copies, and preserved entire in the Roman Registers;
or else that the fault of some Scribe, who in stead of Sardis (because the name
thereof was then infamous) did put in the name of the Council of Nice: or else
(this is Cardinal Bellarmines conceit) that Mihi admodum probabile videtur in
Nicaeno Conc. non fuisse express hos tres Canones, de quibus agimus, sed a
Sozimo and Bonifacio voca^i Canones Nicaenos, quia Conc. Nicaenum and
Sardicense pro vno habebantur, and vtriusque Conc. Canones simul in Bibliotheca
Romans coniuncti habebantur, cuius rei ignoratio Patres Africanos perturbabat.
Bellarm lib. 2. de Romans Pont. cap. 25.. Dico tertio.
although this Canon was not in the Council of Nice, but in Sardis, yet the
Popes named it the Nicene Canon, because the Council of Nice and of Sardis
were held both as one.

16 And finally, (to shut and lock up the door after them) they will have us
believe, that when the Catholics celebrated their Council of Sardis, the
Arrian heretics gathered a conuenticle at See above lit. d. So Bellarmine: the
same is in Binius.
Philippolis, calling it (for confusion sake) the Council of Sardis, Ariani
conciliabulum nomine Sardicensis Conc. condecoratum Constantij Imperatoris
patrocinio, velut vnicum atque legitimum Sardicense Conc. omnibus in locis
promulgari curauerint, vnde hoc callide and per imposturam haereticorum
e^^ectuni est vt S. Augustinus, Alipius, alijque Catholici, ignorantes haec
duo, vnum legitimum, alterum illegitimum habitum fuisse, vtrumque veluti impium
d^testati fuerit. Binius Anno^. in Council. Sardic. page 440. col. 1. and
Baronius Anno 347. numer. 74.
and under the patronage of the Emperor Constantius (say our Adversaries)
proclaimed it sor the orthodoxall Sardice; by which impostureship it came to
pass, that afterward S. Augustine and other Catholics (say they) ignorantly
conceived both the Sardicans to be one, and therefore did detest both as
impious and heretical.

17 These answers are fettered with four notable improbabilities: for first,
to imagine that only Rome did preserve the true copies of the Nicene Council,
is so to dignifie the integrity of one Chair, as thereby to impute an
irreligious and unpardonable negligence unto all other Churches (as well Greek
as Latin) throughout the Christian world, for neglect of a Canon, which, in
their opinion, does necessarily concern the universal Church of Christ.

18 Secondly, to think, that because the name of Sardican Council was made
common unto the orthodoxall and the heretical parties, there followed a
confusion of the Councels themselves, is but a negligent conceit: for, as the
Spirit of God distinguishes the community of names by the diversity of
Adjuncts, as (for example) the name Simon, which was common to the disciple of
Christ with a master of Magic, is discerned by additions, thus, Simon Peter,
and Simon Magus; by which sirnames the persons themselves are distinguished. So
also the name of Judas common unto an elect Saint with a child of perdition, is
notified by distinct attributes thus, Judas James brother, and Judas Iscariot.
So had it been easy for the Catholics and true professors in the days of
Constantius, to have avoided the supposed confusion of the names of Sardice,
either by the adiunct of time, in calling the one the first, the other the
second; or in respect of quantity, by naming one the greater, and the other
the less: or from the difference of quality, mentioning the one by the name
of orthodoxall and Catholic, and the other Arrianicall and heretical: and by
any note of distinction, although it had bin by calling the one A, and the
other B, rather then to have suffered (which they now pretend) that an See
above in this Chapter.
Oecumenicall Council of Sardice, and of equal authority with the ancient
Council of Nice, to vanish for a long time, and so, in a manner to betray, by
negligence, a doctrine of truth.

19 The third improbabilitie resulteth from the consideration of S. Augustine
and the Church of Afric, who notwithstanding that they lived not long after
the time of the imagined Sardican Council, yet did they not acknowledge any
orthodoxal Council of Sardice, and are for this cause by our Adversaries
termed Ignorants: and yet do all the learned know and acknowledged these
Africane Churches to have been noble members of the Catholic body of Christ,
for sincerity as faithful, for all industry as painful, for conueniencie
more fit and able to discuss, discern, and discover this truth, then any new
coniecturall discourse can be.

20 The last improbabilitie is that which maruellously preiudiceth their Roman
See; for in their answers their Popes are brought in also as deceived by the
Scribe, who in steed of Sardice put in the Council of Nice: and when this is
disproued by the words of the Popes Legate, (who in the foresaid Council of
Afric made express mention of the Council of Sardice) they then answer, that
In isto Conc. Carthag. 6. c. 6. citatur nominatim Sardicense. -- Respondeo,
illa verba non esse Africanorum, sed Legatorum Pontificis. Et praeterea
existimo eum locum corruptum, and vel positum a librarijs, aut quod magis
suspicor, ex margin irrepsisse in textum. Bellar lib. 2. de Pont. cap. 25..
Sed dices.
these words of the Legates may be suspected (by the fault of some scribes) to
have crept out of the margent into the text. The proverb says, Ex vngue
leonem, and may not we perceive how licentiate-like the Romish Scribes in those
times were for the aduantaging of the Popes prerogatives? But yet again, the
Popes (say they) named it the Council of Nice, because the Council of Nice
and Sardice were held as both one. How could this be, seeing that the
difference of their times is noted by themselves, to have been no less then
the space of 18 Nicaenum Conc. anno 325. Sardicense, 347. Baronius.
years; the distance of place is confessed to have been as much, as between

Canons themselves to be, in many articles, as diverse as was either the time
or the place?

21 Yet howsoever, seeing that in the whole canuase which was now between the
Church of Rome and Afric, and that their three Popes contended to manifest
the right of their claim of Appeals by good and necessary evidence, it may
seem a thing not only improbable, but impossible also, that those their
Popes, after so long inquisition, should not have made the like answers, which
our Adversaries have newly coniectured, if they had thought such answers to
have been justifiable in those times; and not by their silence have sustained
that great blot of suggestion of a wrong Canon, and the perpetual prejudice
against their claim of Appeals to Rome, to stick so fast upon the Papal
succession. For the conclusion of that Synod was a flat prohibition of all the
Clergy in Afric, not to appeal unto Rome upon pain of Ad transmarina aute^

col. 2.
Bishops (if they should happily have so transgressed) as upon any Ministers of
inferior degrees. From these premises we may boldly derive

A Conclusion of this point, by way of Appeal.
SECT. 5.
22 The question is, whether the Popes have been justly challenged of an
innovation of a Canon of Nice: we have seen our Adversaries working by all
their wit and art to deliver their head (the Pope) out of this loope: but the
more they struggle and seek to dissolve the knot, the more they seem to
strangle the party, whilst for our satisfaction they can bring no better
answers then such which redound unto the imputation either of drowsy
negligence, or else of dull ignorance unto the grave and godly Pat^iarchs,
Cyrill, and Atticus, S. Augustine, and unto 217. orthodoxall Bishops in the
Council of Afric, as though they wanted either will to seek or skill to
discern the true Canons of Councels, not long before their times: hereby
likewise staining their then Popes, as if they could not distinguish between
Nice and Sardice.

23 But their defense is made more unjustifiable by their manifold
contradictions: some affirming that there were See above Sect. 3.
more then twenty Canons in the Council of Nice, others See above ibid.
disprouing this; one side they object that the Sea above. 3. number. 9.

factions in one city: Cardinal Baronius to the same end does place them in
two diverse cities, Sardice, and Pentapolis. And much doubting there is in
confessing whether the Popes did know the difference of the Sea ibid.
Councels of Nice and Sardice, or no: together with many other perplexities and
incongruities: all which fictitious presumptions of the defenders do but
confirm unto us the former suspision, that the Popes reason for challenge of
Appeals was a mere ^igment, and the claim it selse an innovation; so that we
need not doubt with their Cardinal Cusanus to adhere unto the judgment of S.
Augustine and the other famous Bishops of Afric, who concluded against the
Popes allegation of a Canon of a Council generally thus: In nulla Patrum
definitione huic Ecclesiae derogatum est Affricanae. Apud Surium Conc. Affric.
epist. ad Celest.
Never any Council did derogate so much from the Church of Afric, as to
allow Appeals from them unto Rome: and against the claim it self, to denounce
excommunication against those that should use any such Appeal.

24 Let us but add hereunto the Canons of the Council of Sardice, as they now
stand, and are usually alleged by our Adversaries, and they may seem to
impair the now Romish challenge of Appeals, both because they do not define
any privilege of Appeals de iure unto the Pope, but do only de facto allow
it him with an arbitrarie, Osius Episcopus dixit: Illud quoque necessario
adijeiendum est, vt Episcopi de sua prouincia ad aliam prouinciam, in qua non
sunt Episcopi, non transeant, nisi forte a f^atribus suis inuitati, ne videamur
ianuam claudere charitatis. Illud quoque prouidendum es^ si in aliqua prouincia
aliquis Episcopus contra fratrem suum Episcopum litem habuerit, ne vnus e
duobus ex alia prouincia aduocet Episcopum cognitorem. Quodsi aliquis Episcopus
iudicatus fuerit in aliqua causa, and putat se bonam causam habere, vt iterum
Concilium renouetur, si vobis placet, S. Petri Apostoli memoriam honoremus, vt
scribatur ab his qui causam examinarunt, Iulio Romans Episcopo: and si
iudicauerit renouandum esse iudici^m, renouetur, and det Iudices. Si autem
probauerit talem causam esse, vt non refricentur ea, quae acta sunt: quae
decreuerit, confirmata erunt, si hoc omnibus placet? Synodus respondet, placet.
Conc Sardicens. cap. 3. apud Surium, Tom. 1. Osius Episcopus dixit: Placuit
autem, vt si Episcopus accu^a^^^ fuerit, and iudicauerint congregati Episcopi
regionis ipsius, and de gradu suo cum deiecerint, si appellauerit qui deiectus
est, and confugerit ad ^piscopum Rom* Ecclesiae, and voluerit se ^^diri, si
iustum putauerit vt renouetur iudicium, vel disc^ssionis examen, scribere his
Episcopis dignetur, qui in finitima and propinqua prouincia sunt, vt ipsi
diligenter omnino requirant, and iuxta fidem veritatis definiant. Quod si is,
qui ^ogat causam suam iterum audiri, deprecatione sua mouerit Episcopum Romans vt
e latere suo Presbyterum mittat, erit in potestate Episcopi quod velit, and
quod aestimet. ^tsi decreuerit mittendos esse q^i praesentes cum Episcopis
iudicent, habentes cius authoritatem, a quo destinati sunt, erit in suo
arbitrio. Si vero crediderit Episcopos sufficere vt negotio terminum imponant,
faciet quod sapientissimo cons^lio suo iudicaue^it. Idem Conc. Sardic. ca. 7.
si vobis omnibus placet: and do also prescribe unto him a manner of
proceeding, which is not pe^emptorily to overrule such matters by himself
alone, but to use the consent of other Bishops.

25 By this canuasse of so important a case, viz. Appeals unto Rome, which at
this day is made an essential prerogative of the Popedom, we cannot but
observe, that in those ancient times it was not acknowledged as due unto the
Pope, either by divine law, or by ordinance Ecclesiastical: for if it had
appertained unto him by that law of Christ, would either the then Popes have
conceited, or those Affricane Bishops denied the right of appealing unto (as
they now pretend) the successor of S. Peter, the Vicar of Christ, and supreme
Judge of the whole Church? And if any universal constitution Ecclesiastical
had established it, would so reverend, ancient, and famous a Council, which
was so inquisitiue into the acts of the Council of Nice, have conspired with
general consent to decree so solemnly, so severely, and resolutely against it?
Doubtless, if those Popes could then have pleaded Gospel for it, they would
have mentioned, at least, one text of Scripture for proof of that privilege:
and if any general Council had acknowledged it, S. Augustine and the Africane
Bishops would not have refused it. * Card. Bellarm. his answer, saying that the
question was not an liceret, sed an expediret, is confuted by the proceeding ^f
the Synod, who show, that it was not lawful because it was not expedient. Will
our adversaries say, that it is not expedient to vs^ the ordinance of Christ:
or that particular Churches, as Affricke was, may prescribe unto the Pope laws
of expediencie?

Hugo, saying, that the Apostles did not ordain, that they (speaking of
Priests and Deacons) should not have the use of wedlock, which they had
contracted before their ordination. Where also their Romish Gloss says, that
some affirm Syricius to have brought in the law of continency of Priests and
Deacons: and whereas the text of the Decree names antiquity for proof of the
law of continency, that is (says the Gloss) from the time of Syricius. Which
seemed also unto their Polydore a sufficient proof, for hereupo^ At
Occidentalibus paulatim est connubium abrogatum: Syricius enim primus
Sacerdotibus and Diaconis, vt ait Gratian. Did. 82. coniugio interdixit: qui
circiter annum salutis humanae 387. sedere coepit. Polydor. Virgil. de Invent.
lib. 5. cap. 4. page 319.
Syricius was the first (says he) who, as Gratian says, in the year 387. did
forbid the marriage of Priests. Which Gloss has been allowed by their last
corrected edition of Pope Editio Greg. 13.
Gregory the thirteenth. And could it be modesty in the Apologists contrarily
to affirm, that M. Whitaker alleged no proof? We must in the next place see
how they can free Syricius from the guilt of innovation.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Secondly, we allege most plainly to the contrary, how that S. Hierome who
lived in the time of Damasus predecessor to Syritius, says hereof: Hierom. in
apolog ad Pamach c. 3. and the same doctrine does he affirm in c. 1. ad Titum.
If married men like not this, let them not be angry with me but with the holy
Scriptures, with all Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, who know they cannot offer
Sacrifice, if they use the act of marriage. And this opinion was then not first
begun, but (to the contrary) so universal, that Hierome affirms it to be
the general Doctrine and practice of Hierom. contra Vigilant. c. 1. says:
Quid faciunt Orient is Ecclesiae, quid Egypti and sedis Apostolicae? quae aut
virgins clericos accipiunt, aut continentes, aut si vxores habuerint, mariti

was the marriage of Priests long before these times so plainly impugned even in
the Greek Church by Epiphanius haer. 59. after other plain words had hereof,
says, At dices mihi in quibusdam locis adhuc liberos gignere Presbyteros,
Diaconos, and Hipodiaconos: at hoc non est iuxta Canonem, etc. So plainly does
he acknowledge hereby a former Canon.
Epiphanius, Origin. in Numer. hom. 23. says, Certum est quia impeditur
sacrificium indesinens ijs qui coniugalibus necessitatibus seruiunt, vnde
videtur mihi quod illius est solius offerre sacrificium indesinens, qui

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing a great oversight of the Apologists in urging
these testimonies of the Fathers.
SECT. 2.
2 We have but two answers unto the Apologists, to wit, that they like
unskillful markmen, have shot both short, and also over the mark. Short, by
ignorance (as we think) of a difference which there is between the condition
de matrimonio contrahendo, and de matrimonio contracto, that is, before
contracting of matrimony, and after the matrimony is contracted. The
institution of perpetual continency, which was imputed unto Syricius, was (as
the Romish Gloss, which is noted by Doctor Whitaker, plainly See above Sect.
1. b.
expresses,) that although a Priest had been contracted in matrimony, yet did
Syricius enjoin a separation, by this means to preserve a perpetual
continency in the Clergy. But the instances which they object out of the
Fathers, do not entreat at all of matrimony contracted. And thus our
Apologists have been occupied only in beating the air; for as yet Syricius
may go for an innouator in his absolute decree of perpetual continency, unto
persons Ecclesiastical.

3 Their next fault is ouer-shooting: which we will show orderly in their
several testimonies. First the former sentence of S. Hierome is much depraved:
for it should have been expressed thus: If married men like not this, let them
not be angry with me, but with Scriptures, with Bishops, Priests, and Deacons,
(then follows that, which the Apologists have learnedly omitted) yea and with
all the order Leuiticall, who knew (the Apologists have changed into know) that
they could not offer Sacrifice, when they used the marriage bed. In the which
place S. Hierome proves only the excellency of virginity in respect of
marriage: Opera legis nuptiae sunt, vnde and maledicuntur eae, quae non habent
filios. Quae si conceduntur etiam in Euangelio, aliud tamen est indulgentiam
infirmitati tribuere, aliud est virtutibus praemia polliceri. Ecce perspicue
diximus nuptias concedi in Euangelio, sed tamen cosdem in suo officio
permanentes praemia castitatis capere non posse. Quod si indigne accipiunt
mariti, non mihi irascantur, sed Scripturis sacris, imo Episcopis, Presbyteris,
and Diaconis, and vniuerso cho^o Sacerdota^i and Leuitico, qui se nouerunt
hostias offerre non posse, si operi seruiant coniugali. Hieron. loco citato,
Tom. 2. page 104.
Behold (says he) we have plainly confessed that the Gospel does allow
marriage, but so, that the married parties do not desire the reward of virgins;
but does not touch the necessity of perpetual continency in Priests, which
the place it self does prove by two sufficient arguments.

4 First, let them not be angry with me, (says he) but with Scriptures,
reproving only that which is reproueable by Scriptures: but the Sea above.
Jesuits themselves have confessed, even from the sentence of the Council of
Trent, that the marriage of Priests' is not forbidden by Scriptures. Secondly,
he uses the example of the Leuiticall Priests, who although they were
commanded to contain, during the course of their sacrificing (which proves
the excellency of virginity,) yet were they married. Which clause, lest it
might appear, the Apologists did artificially discard, and as though it had
been directly spoken of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons of the new Testament, did
change the tence of the verb [knew] into [know.] Again, elsewhere his
consequences are as strong to prove that the Laity may not be married, because
the Apostle says: Supra in eadem Apologia. Sed qui semel duxit vxorem, nisi ex
consensu se non valet abstinere -- reddat coniugi debitum, quia sponte se
alligauit, vt regete cogeretur. Page 102. Similiter viri cohabitantes iuxta
scientiam -- vt (...) cohibeantur orationes. Ib. p. 21. Et paulo post. Vt
vacetis orationi, and iterum reuertimini ad idipsum -- quod dixit secundum
indulgentiam, non secundum imperium. Page 22.
Separate your selves for prayer, for a time.

5 The next testimonies of S. Hieroms 2. Testimony, Aut si vxores habuerint
mariti esse desinu^t, does not exact it by necessity of law, but by liberty of
consent, a^ in some cases he did in the laity. See above.
Hierome and of Epiphanius his Canon concerns not them who are married, which
is Syricius his case.
Epiphanius, are not within the compass of this question, which only
concerns Syricius.

6 The words of Origin seem at the first view to give the vp-shot, but it
aims also at a wrong mark: for he mentioning Orig. hom 23. speaking of every
Christian: Agnoscat quisquis vult esse persectus and sanctus -- quod semper and
indesinenter iustus debet facere diem festum. -- Sacrificium indesinens est si
sine intermissione oremus -- certum est qui peccat, and diem peccati agit,
agere non potest diem festum: and ideo in diebus, quibus pecat, non potest

that can pray unto God, and does as well prove that no Christian man may be

refer them unto their own Bishop Espencaeus, who expounds the sentence of

literally to castrate themselves, as to admit the necessary law of continency.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Concerning the story of Paphnutius in the Council
of Nice: whether it does more favor the Protestants or Romanists.
SECT. 3.
8 Ecclesiastical Historians must be required to speak: Socrates (with whom
Sozomen concurreth) says, that Visum erat Episcopis legem nouam in Ecclesiam
introducere, vt qui essent sacris initiati, sieut Episcopi, Presbyteri, and
Diaconi, cum vxoribus, quas cum erant laici in matrimoniu^ duxissent, minime
dormirent. -- Surrexit Paphnutius, vehementer vocife^a^us est, non grave ^agum
ceruicibus illorum imponendum esse, qui erant sacris initiati: honorabile esse
coniugium inter omnes, and torom im^ aculatum. -- I^lud satis esse, vt qui in
Clerum ante ascripti erant, quam duxissent vxores, ^i secundum veterem
^cclesiae traditionem dcinceps a nuptijs se abstinerent: non tamen quenquam ab
illa, quam iampridem, cum laicus erat, vxorem duxisset, s^^ungi debere. Istam
in Episcoporum conuentu orationem habuit Paphnutius, cum ipse non modo nuptras
non expertus esset. -- Itaque cum totus Episcoporum, Presbyterorum, and
Diaconorum conuentus verbis Paphnutij assensisset, etc. Socrates hist.
Ecclesiast. lib. 1. cap. 8.
when in the Council of Nice it had been intended to forbid those Bishops,
Priests, and Deacons the use of their wives, who had married before their
ordination (which Socrates calls a bringing in of a new law) then arose up
Paphnutius, who himself had never been married, and vehemently resisted them,
calling this kind of Constitution an heavy yoke, and reasoned from that
Scripture, (...), etc. [Marriage is honorable among all men:] that they, who
were unmarried before their ordination. should so continue according unto the
old tradition: and in the end, the whole Synod consented unto the judgment of
Paphnutius. This is the story.

9 We are now to enquire whether the Romanists or Protestants have more cause
to allow or dislike the decree of this Council; for each side is both crossed,
and aduantaged hereby. The Council allows men married before they were
ordained, to continue in the same state of wedlock: this part of the decree
the Protestants do apprehend. The same Council restrains them from marriage,
who were unmarried when they entered into Orders: which part the Romanists do no
less vehemently urge and inculcate. The ods herein will be very obseruable.

10 Understand we therefore that the absolute forbidding of the marriage of
Priests, is called in that Council a new law, and the restraint of their
marriage after ordination, is termed an old tradition: and may not now both
parts seem to be even? No: for the new law, which Syricius did defend
contrary unto the wisdom of that Council, Paphnutius did there prove to be
repugnant unto Scripture: but that which was called an old tradition, and
whereunto Protestants do take exception, is not (our Adversaries witnessing
thus much) commanded in Scripture, but ordained only by Ecclesiastical
constitutions: so that Syricius and his defenders stand guilty of the breach
of divine law, but Protestants only do transgress the ordinance of man.

11 Secondly (to compare Tradition with Tradition*) the license of marriage of
Priests is as ancient as the Audi quid Clemens ad^ersus hos scrupulosos
sanctos, qui nuptias spernunt, scribit [An and Apostolos improbant? Petrus enim
and Philippus vxores habuerunt.] Hunc Apostolicum ritum diu seruatum constat:
at postea adstricta est, vt Sacer dotibus and Diaconis liceret virg. habere
vxorem. Polydor. Virgil. lib. 5. Invent. cap 4. page 317, 318.
Apostles; but the original of the non-marriage was of latter invention, and
therefore, in comparison, but newly old.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.

13 Here we see the Apologists seek not their own satisfaction, but their
answerers vexation; otherwise they might have contented themselves with the
answer which was given them by D. Whitaker, whom they now personally oppugn:
wherein he wished his Adversaries to Carthaginense 2. Concilium Syricij huius

Whitaker in his book objected, page 514.
consider the time of this second Council of Carthage, and the sense thereof.

14 Concerning the time, to know, that it was not more ancient then Syricius
himself: which conuinceth the sophistry of our Adversaries, who contend to
prove, that Syricius was not the first author of this constrained perpetual
continency, because (forsooth) the Council of Carthage did the like, which
Council was not before, but (if we believe their own Notae in Council. Carthag

reserved something unto our conclusion of this question touching Syricius,
whereunto we approach.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY: By way of Conclusion.
So evident hereby it is, that Siritius in his foresaid doctrine hereof,
brought in no innovation or change.

THE PROTESTANTS CONCLUSION, by way of Appeal.
SECT. 5.
17 Nay rather, so evident it is that Syricius was the Innouator, that nothing
has been yet objected to the contrary, but an unlearned mistaking of the
state of the controversy, by not discerning between marriage before, and
marriage after ordination; or between a partly, and an absolutely forbidding
of the marriage of Ministers: the first whereof, some more ancient then
Syricius had taught, but the second Syricius did first decree, as has been See
above Sect. 1.
confefsed by good evidence from their own Gloss, and other authors.

18 In the second place they Sect 2.
have dis^imbed and dismembered a material and pertinent clause of a sentence
of one Father, and distorted the testimonies of diverse, as has been proved by
their own Bishop: who has likewise confessed the lawfulness of conjugal
society of Priests with their wives, even in the Sect. 2.
marriage bed, from the express evidence of antiquity.

19 Thirdly, they have insisted upon the decree of the Council of Nice, by the
direction of Paphnutius, to the utter overthrow of their present cause, as has
been proved by the evidence of many Sect. 3.
confessed authorities.

20 Lastly, they have labored to prove a decree against marriage of Priests
before Syricius by the Canon of a Council of Carthage, which Council was
either at the same time when Syricius lived, or rather many years after; and
not so only, but also mis-const^uing the sense of that Council, as has been
showed by the evidence of our Adversaries own Sect. 4.
confession. Judge now (good Reader) by all these evidences, whether the
Apologists have not been not only in a sort imposturous in their pretense,
saying, so evident, etc. but also succes^esse in their purpose of freeing
Syricius from the imputation of innovation and change in the absolute and
perpetual restraint of the marriage of Priests.

21 To conclude, the decree of Syricius was so originally new by his
imposition, and in it own nature so irreligious and intolerable, that again
their own Bishop is bold to say: Romanos autem P^^tisices Sy^^cium imprimis
and Innocent^^ quibu^cum (...) ^xec^or (viz the (...)* for necessity of
continen^y, Io^^n^an for necessity of marriage) In hoc argumento Pont ^ces
quanto m^^ores adeoque maximos tanto magis reuerenter inter^ogo leges*

the necessity.) -- Pau^^a quae allegant vel (...) es^e ^^undum, (...) [qui

Iabhorre (his own words) Pope Syricius, together with Iouinian. Both which
(as in the same book he shows) were in two extremities; Iouinian thought it
unlawful for any to be a Priest, who was not married, but Syricius thought
that no married man might be a Priest: both which he proves to be contrary
both unto Scriptures and prime antiquity; instifying the lawfulness of the
marriage of Ecclesiastical persons by the judgment of Aenaeas Syluius, who
was also Pope Pius; him he produces as he was Aenaeas, confessing, that
Aenaeam Syluium etiam Papam Pium 2* ferunt considerantem coelibatus iugum cum
Sacerdotij statu annexum, nec natura es^e, nec biblica seu Canonica Scriptura,
sed vel cu^sque voto, vel Ecclesiae statuto, nec v^^uersalis sed Latinae, ignem

cum alij tum Platina inter prouerbiales eius sententias scriptam reliquit.
Espencaeus de Continent. lib. 1. cap. 13. page 129.
neither Nature, nor Scripture, nor any Canon of the universal Church imposed
upon Priests the snare of single life: adding that as there was good cause
sometimes to restrain the Clergy from marriage, so now there is better reason
to permit it unto them. Which Syluius, being afterward Pope, although he
justified the now custom, Sed ferunt aliter sensisse ac scripsisse Syluiu^,
aliter Pium. Et proinde qualecunque priuati hominis, and nullius authoritatis

egerunt, illis vxores fuerunt, nobis de^unt, and magis meremur. ^sp^ncaeus ibid.
forbidding the Clergy to marry, yet did he confess, that the primitive
Church did not err in their contrary custom. Here we see antiquity, then he
adds: We are not bound to follow the Fathers of the primitive Church in all
things; they had wives, we have none, and therein are we of more worthy
desert. And is not this a note of an apparent and arrogant nouelty?

22 As Pope Syricius was the first innouator in the absolute forbidding of
Priests marriage, so Pope Pelagius (the second of that name) is found the first
who P^lagius ^ statuit vt Subdraconi vel vxores a se separarent, vel illis
contenti, Sacerdotiorum possessione cederent: and cum neut^um admisissent,
iussit vt omnino vxores, exemplo post hommes natos importunissimo, ab se
ablegarent. Verum id decretum Gregorius, qui Pelagio successit, iniq^um
censuit, vt Euangel^o contrarium, quod iubet vxorem stupri causa tantum di^
itti, and idcirco sanxit, vt nullus amplius sieret Subdiaconus, nisi se cast
victurum p^ius promisisset, quo sic cunctis legem contincou^ imponeret. Polyd.
Virgil. lib. 5. Inu ^nt. cap. 4. page 319. 320.
decreed, that subdeacons who were married, should either put away their wives,
or relinquish their benefices: a thing (says their own Author) never done
before, and by a succeeding Pope disanulled as unjust. Why then should it seem
strange unto any, that Popes have innouated and changed customs, and that
sometimes a just one into an impious and unjust? Thus much of the third
instance.

He that first muented Transubstantiation was Innocent the third, in the
Laterane Council. Whereto we answer, first, that M. Whitaker bar^ly affirms,
but proves not this his assertion, neither does he allege so much as any one
author of those times, charging this Pope Innocent or that Council with any
Innovation or change of doctrine in this matter. And we further say, that M.
Whitaker urges this example howsoever against his knowledge and learning, yet
most clearly against all evidence of truth.

not to discuss them. But because herein we see so deep a taxation of untruth,
we further proceed to hear their pretended evidence.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
For this Council of Laterane was holden Anno. 1215. And as appears by the
said Council an^ further testimony of Crispinus in his book of the estate of
the Church, page 345. sine.
Protestants, there were present thereat the Patriarchs of Jerusalem, and
Constantinople; 70. Metropolitanes; 400. Bishops: and 800. Conuentuall Priors.
Now that so many learned men of so many several remote Nations of the
CHRISTIAN world, as were here assembled, should all of them agree to decree
Transubstantiation, and yet the same to be an innovation (as M. Whitaker
says,) th^n first invented, is more then improbable.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Proving that Transubstantiation was the decree of
Pope Innocentius, and not of the Council of Laterane.
SECT. 2.
2 A great congregation there was in this Council of Laterane, not only of At

Patriarchs, Metropolitanes, Bishops, Priors, but (as Platina notes)
Ambassadors of the Greek and Roman Emperors, and of the Kings of France,
England and Spain. One special reason of such a multitude was, because when
the Pope perceived the power of the Saracens to increase in Asia, he gathered a
most ample Council in Laterane, to advise how they might repress the fury of
the Turk.

3 As for the number of Patriarchs, our Authors have showed, that it is no
news for Popes easily to make new titularie and (as it were) painted The Pope
made Latin Prelates Patriarchs of Constantinople against the Greek ones. Conc

the fury of the Sea above lit. ^.
Saracens; yet did he also conceive and project some conclusions, which he
intended to have had confirmed by that Synod, but which our Adversaries cannot
prove to have been determined and defined in that Council: which we speak not
without reason. For

5 First all Councels, which were, in the common account of our Adversaries,
general, were sealed with Conc. Nicaenum 1. Conc. Constantinop. 1. Conc.
Calcedon. Conc. Constant. 2. and Constantinop. 3. And of their own, Nicaenum
2. Florentinum, Tridentinum. All subscribed. See the Councels.
subscriptions: which being not found in this Council, do not a little disable
their evidence, for want (as it were) of a seal.

6 Secondly, in other acknowledged Synods the definitive Canons are
particularly set down: but See above lit. a.
at the Council of Laterane (says Platina) many things were consulted upon,
but nothing plainly defined, by reason of some wars in some places; whither
Pope Innocentius went, with purpose to compose those contentions, and died at
Perusium, as others do likewise confess. And can our Adversaries make
something of nothing?

7 Thirdly, in a case against heretical Kings, Pope Innocentius the fourth (
Innocentius 4. the next but one after Gregory 9. and the fourth after
Innocentius the 3. persuading the Inqui^itors of Italy to execute an act
against heretical Kings: which act is now set down in the devised form of the
Counsel of Lateran: Sivero Dominus temporalis, etc. cap. 3. but he does not
urge it as by virtue of any Canon of that Council, but only from the decree
of the Emperor. Literae Apostolicae Romans Pontificis in directorio

who, not long after, was successor unto this Innocentius the third) did not
urge the Canon now professed and practiced by the Romanists, which is the
bellows of all rebellion, viz. the power of deposing of Kings: but that
Innocentius insisted only upon the Imperial law, for the effecting of his
execution. Shall we suspect any Pope of later times so abject in his own
estimation, as to prefer the decree of an Emperor before the constitution or
Canon of a Pope?

8 Fourthly, if the Canons had been then concluded (as they have pretended) how
comes it to pass, that till after Iacobus Merlin Doctor in his book of
Councels printed Paris. Anno. 1535.
Merline (who lived about the year 1530.) no such form or Canon of a Council
could be shown? Shall we expect revelations from the dead?

only reference unto the Council of ^ateran, saying, In Conc. Lateranensi
prohibitum est. See Surius in this Council, cap. 29. 33. 61.
Petrus Quintes (when he purposed to set forth the perfect body of the
Councels, and thinking it was lame of two limbs, viz. the Canons of the
Council of Lateran, and of Vienna) sought for a supply from their Cochlaeus,
who sent him (as he says) the decrees of Laterane taken out of an old book.
Which we may judge to be a new and suspicious trick, the rather because that
which they suggest from the fame of that Council, is termed by their own

above lit. i.
The most part, said their Cochlaeus. And why not all? For both these Canons by
them newly The seventy Canons of Binius compared with the decrees of Innocent.
broached, and the Papal decrees, are all the same.

10 As yet then nothing appears to prove the Council of Laterane, but Pope
Innocentius only to have been the author of those Canons, and consequently in
this point an innouator: therefore cannot these Apologists be judged fit men to
plead the evidence of truth, who stand only upon an improbable, if not an
impossible improbabilitie, for their discharge. And yet they continue their
plea.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The truth hereof therefore was most plainly to the contrary, that in the age
before that Council, the doctrine of Transubstantiation was public and
general: only Berengarius as then impugned the same, and was therein
publicly contradicted, and specially written against by diverse Fathers There
did in that age write purposely in proof of the Real presence Anselmus,
Lanfrancus, Guitmundus, Adelmanus, Algerus, Hugo Lingonensis, and others:
insomuch that Papir. Masson. Annal. Francorum, l. 3. in Henrico Rege,
testifies saying, Berrengario, omnes illius temporis Theologi bellum indixere.
And Oecolampadius in libro epist. Oecolampadij and Suinglij, l. 3. page 712.
fine, says, Viuo Berengario, multi contra ipsum scripserunt.
of several Nations in that age: In so much as the foresaid Council of
Laterane was at length then afterward assembled against that his then new
seeming opinion. A thing so evident that M. Fox confesses and says thereof;
Fox Act. Monumen* printed 1576. page 1121. b. circa medium.
About the year of our Lord 1060. the denying of Transubstantiation, began to
be accounted heresy, and in that number was first one Berengarius who lived
about Anno. 1060. So far was Transubstantiation from being (as M. Whitaker
pretends) first affirmed or invented afterward in the Council of Laterane
Anno. 1215.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Further proving the Pope Innocentius, an innouator
herein.
SECT. 3.
11 The question is not about the corporal presence of Christ in the
Eucharist, which D. D. Whitaker in the place objected.
Whitaker confesses to have been held by Pope Nicholas (who lived before this
Innocentius, in the year 1060, as the Apologists themselves acknowledge,) but
the controversy is concerning the manner of his * See hereafter their 8.
instance.
presence, whether it were by changing the substance of the bread into the
substance of the body of Christ, which our Adversaries call
Transubstantiation, holding it for an article of faith; and this article our
Doctor has ascribed unto Pope Innocentius the third, as unto the prime and
principal patron thereof: and therefore is he here noted as one gainsaying an
evident truth: yet has he said no more then their own great Schoolmen have
affirmed, saying of Transubstantiation, that Vnum addit Scotus, quod minime
probandum est, ante Lateranense Concilium non fuisse dogma fidei
Transubstantiationem: id enim ille dixit, quia non legerat Conc. Romanum sub
Gregorio 7. neque consensum illum Patrum quem nos supra adduximus. Bellar. l.
3. de Euch. c. 23.. Vnum. But see this confuted in this Section* and of Gabriel
see herafter cap. 21. Sect. 2.
before the Council of Laterane it was no doctrine of Faith.

12 Secondly, we ought to discern among the Romanists a double Tenet
concerning Transubstantiation, the one is only in the probability of opinion,
the other in belief of necessity thereof, as it is now held in the Church of
Rome. Doctor Whitaker does not affirm that Innocentius was the first inuenter
of the opinion, but the first author to authorize it for a doctrine of faith.
These two distinctions premised, we put the matter unto trial.

13 Cardinal Non so^um praesentiam realem, vt antea coactus erat in Conc.
Romano sub Nicholao 2. sed etiam in Conc. Romano sub Gregorio 7. (cuius Conc.
meminit Waldensi^) -- Transmutationem panis in corpus Domini. Bellar. lib. 1.
de Euch. cap. 1.. Quartus.
Bellarmine examining the time of Berengarius (under Pope Nicholas the second)
shows, that he was not then condemned for Transubstantiation about that time,
but in a Roman Council under Gregory the seventh: which was some ninteene
years after. But how is this proved? Because, forsooth, Waldensis (one of
their own Schoolmen) has made mention of this Synod. How shall we believe
this, seeing they are See Surius in his third Tome of the Council sub Greg. 7.
not able to show us any such acts of any Council under Gregory the seventh?
For except they will condemn their Church of impiety in neglecting the
preservation of the Popes acts, which they hold (especially in a matter of
this moment) as an Oracle of God, they can deserve no credit in this pretense.

14 The conclusion from our first distinction is, that seeing Berengarius is
not found to have been condemned for the article of Transubstantiation either
about the year 1060, or (for ought that has been proved) under Gregory the
seventh, their instance taken from Berengarius can make but a^aw collection.

15 We come to examine the necessity thereof, and what decree of credit they
stamp upon it, whether of common opinion, or (as our Doctor meant) of a
general and necessary doctrine of faith. What can be more evident for our
discharge then the evident and confessed assertion of Scotus their great
Schoolman? for the which cause he is reprehe^ded by Cardinal See above. lit. b.
Bellarmine, as though this saying were utterly untrue, notwithstanding that
their Bishop of Eureux, at his late conference does seem rather to justify
Scotus: Addit pro eodem proposito a Card. Bellarmino reprehendi Scotum, quod
putauerit Transubstant, non fuisse articulum fidei ante Concilium Lateranense;
id verum est, non erat articulus fidei formaliter, id est, non erat articulus
fidei quoad formalitatem publicae professionis, and quoad prohibitionem, ne
quis hoc ignorans excu^aretur: non plus quam procession^m Spiritus sancti esse
etiam ex Filio, aliaque similia ante ide^ Conc. Lateranense pro articulis fidei
public profitendis habebantur. Colloq. inter Episc. E^roicens. and D de Pless.
Caluinianae sect^ Antesignanum, page 16. Interpret Iacobo Couth^no Burgunds.
It is true (says he) that Transubstantiation was not before the Council of
Laterane formally any article of faith, which is by public prohibition to make
every one that is ignorant hereof, inexcusable. Why then did their Cardinal
Bellarmine pretend a former See above at the letter, b. in the margent.
Roman Council decreing it? Thus are our Adversaries caught in their own
snares; for if the assertion of their Doctor Scotus be reprehensible, how can
their Bishop of Eureux defend him? and if he may be defended, why has the same
assertion of our Doctor Whitaker been reprehended? But the Apologists are not
contented with their former alledgement, for they purpose to show evidence out
of more ancient records for proof of their supposed doctrine of faith. * D.
Whitaker. As for M. Fox his speech, it may be attributed unto (...) too great
credulity unto some Romanists.


THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Secondly. we say, that also the many sayings (over tedious here to recite) of
the other much more ancient Fathers who lived long before the Laterane
Council, are so plain ard pregnant for Transubstantiation, that the learned
Protestants themselves do in plain terms accordingly acknowledge the same,
and therefore reprehend the said Fathers. To omit the plain testimony
Osiander in Epitom. hist. Eccles. Cent 9, 10, 11. and page 95. fine, says,
Anno 950. Exorta est in Clero Cantuariensi acris contentio de Pane

nihilominu^ simul ibi verum Christi corpus porrigi: alij vero pugnabant

Transubstantiation.

Damascene and Theophilact do evidently en^line to Transubstantiation: that
Humfredus in Iesuitismi part 2. rat 5. page 626. says, In Ecclesiam vero quid
inuexerunt Gregorius and A^g^stinus. in^^lerunt etc. Transubstantiationem etc.
Gregory the great and Austen brought into England Transubstantiation: that The
Century writes, Cent. 4. c. 10. col. 985. line 30. say of Eusebius Emissenus
that, Pari^m commode de Transubstantiatione dixit, etc.
Eusebius Emissenus did speak unprofitably of Transubstantiation, that The
Century writers undertaking in their fifth Century, ca. 4. col. 496. line 4. to
set down, errores Doctorum huius seculi, do therein (col. 517. line 23) say,
Chrys^stomus Transubstantiationem videtur confirmare, nam it a scribit

secessum vadunt? absit ne sic cogites, quemadmodum enim si ^era ^g^i adhibita

Chrysostom does seem to (...) Transubstantiation: whereto sun^rte other like
examples might be added: A t^ing so evident that Adamus Francisci (a learned
Protestant writer) does therefore acknowledge, how that Adamus Francisci in
Margarita theologica, page 256. post med. says, Commentum Papistarum de
Transubstantiatione mature in Ecclesiam ^rrep^it.
transubstantiation entered early into the Church: so improp^rly (if not
wilfully v^truly) is the foresaid example of the Laterane Council, and
Innocent the third urged by M. Whitaker, and so many other of his brethren.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 4.
16 Thus indeed the Apologists have said, informing their Reader first, that
Protestants reprehended the Fathers, and that in plain terms, for affirming
Transubstantiation: whereas their exception (as has been showed) was not
against the Fathers doctrine, but for their hyperbolicall phrases, which our
See above l. 2. cap. 2.
Adversaries themselves have likewise disliked.

17 Besides this, we may remember (for why may not we repeat things in
answering of repetitions?) that they have produced for proof of their
Transubstantiation, a feined See above l. 2. cap 2. Sect. 2.

19 Notwithstanding (because we are called unto the considerati^n of

Adversaries usually object, as namely, of Ambrose, Gregory, Chrysostom, Cyrill
Alex. Damascene. Why then should not this Author (who for the excellency of his
wit and judgment had purchased to himself the singular title of subtle
Doctor) see as far into this mystery as any Schoole-man before him? And yet
behold Scotus still maintains his conclusion, viz. Before the Council of
Laterane, Transubstantiation was no doctrine of faith.

22 Him followed Gabriel one of the most singular Doctors of his time, viz.
Anno 1574, who was of the same judgment: which acknowledg^ments do
sufficiently euince, in respect of time, an innovation in this point, which by
good proof has been justly ascribed unto the decree of Pope Innocentius the
third.

CHAP. XI. Of the Popes title of Head, from Boniface the third.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
5 Fifthly, M. Whitaker gives example in Boniface the third, saying Whitaker
contra Duraeum lib. 7. page 480. post medium.
He that first entitled the Roman Church to be caput omniu^ ecclesiarum, the
head of all Churches, was Boniface the third: Whereto we answer, that although
this point be for the matter thereof, already answered by that which has been
heretofore said to the former examples of Victor, Zozimus, Boniface (the first)
and Celestinus:

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
AND we have reioyned already by way of reply, showing how unluckily (on
their part) the Apologists have instanced in the examples either of Victor,
whose excommunication was contemned by the famous Churches of Asia in the
question of See above lib. 2 cap. 22.
Easter; and of Zozimus, Boniface, and Celestine, whose challenge of Appeals
unto Rome, was disclaimed and renounced by the grave, learned, and orthodoxall
African See above ca. 2. Sect. 7. and alibi.
Bishops, among whom S. Augustine was present, and a principal agent. So that
this assumption used by the Apologists, is but a mere presumption. What yet?

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Yet to r^f^ll M. Whitaker even in terminis: whereas Boniface the third was Pope
Anno 607, that very title of being Head, is acknowledged, and given to the
Roman Church by many Fathers Theodoret (though a Grecian) in epist. ad Renatum
Presbyterum, says of the Roman Church, Tenet enim sancta ista se^es
gubernacula regendarum cuncti orbis Ecclesiarum. And in the Council of
Calcedon, Act. 1. it is said, and not contradicted, Papae vrbis Romae, quae est

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
2 Seeing they have failed in the material sense, can they think to prevail
in terminis? No: for the title of Head may signify either a primacie and
chiefdome of order and superiority, or else of sovereignty and jurisdiction.
Ancient See above in the questions concerning the Pope and Rome.
Fathers, we confess, have yielded unto Rome the primacie of order above other
Churches, but that of jurisdiction they did anciently not only not
acknowledge, but also withstand. Whose testimonies, which concern only the
former, are here incongruously produced for proof of the latter, excepting the
testimonies which are taken from the Popes themselves, whom the Centurists do
reprehend and reject as therefore partial witnesses in their own cause.

3 The only express testimony, which they would charge their text with, is
this: Romana Ecclesia est omnium Ecclesiaru^ caput, that is, the Church of Rome
is the head of all Churches. This they allege in terminis from the authority
of the ancient and general Council of Calcedon, which is very true, but in
terminis only, and not in sense. For thereby was not understood the headship
of jurisdiction over other Churches, as evidently appears by the practice of
the Roman Bishops, who repealed some acts of that Council of Calcedon, even
because it derogated from the Sea confessed above, lib. 2. c. 18. Sect. 2.
pre-eminence of the Roman See.

4 Hitherto have we insisted in the matter and in terms severally, now both of
them are jointly to be considered from the same example of Boniface. Their own
Authors Massonius, Blondus, and Polydore do affirm, that Obtinuit tamen a
Phoca, vt Romans seeds omnino and absolute prima diceretur Idque Pauli Diaconi
syncero testimonio firmare licet, qui illa fere tempora attigit. Hoc enim ab
illo narratur lib. 4. de orig. and reb. gestis Longobard. Phocas, (inquit)
rogante Papa Bonifacio, statuit sedem Romanae and Apostolicae Ecclesiae primam

murderer) at the request of Boniface did ordain that the Sea of Rome should
be held to be absolutely the chief Seat: what, in order only? no, but that
also Phocas ipsius Pontificis suasione, publica and ad vniuersum orbem dimissa
sanctione constituit, vt Romanae Ecclesiae, Romanoque Pontifici omnes orbis
Ecclesiae obedirent, etc. Blondus Decad. 1. vt est apud Osiandrum (Papa non

all other Churches should be obedient unto the Sea of Rome. And not this
only, but (if their Polydore err not) Verum cum postea Bonifacius tertius ab
Imperatore Phoca impetrasset, vt in omnes Episcopos praerogatiuam haberet,

Virgil. lib 4. Invent. rerum, cap. 9. page 271.
that the same Boniface himself should be the head of all other Bishops, and
have prerogative above them.

5 Neither will it be a point extrauagant to demand the cause, why Phocas was
so gracious unto Boniface? This is expressed at large by their Cardinal
Baronius, ^he brief whereof is this: Qui (Bonifacius) vsque ad Gregorij obitum
Constantinopoli degens, eundem sibi Phocam demeruit, and in eius se insinuans
amicitiam. -- Cuius rei causa Phocas -- in odium Cyriaci Constantinop.

Pope Boniface in the days of Gregory, had by his merits insinuated into the
favor of Phocas, at what time Cyriacus Patriarch of Constantinople became
hateful unto him, upon which hatred Phocas professed, that the Bishop of Rome
should be accounted the head of all Churches: which Phocas so ordained, as it
may seem, in hatred of the Patriarch Cyriacus. Now the cause of his hate was
this, when Constantina the wife of Mauritius the Emperor, fled for refuge unto
a great Church with her three sons, the tyrant Phocas sent men to apprehend
them, but by the means of Cyriacus the distressed ones were delivered:
wherefore the tyrant grieved for the loss of so great a prey, whereby he saw
an occasion ministered of creating a new Emperor, therefore was he enraged
against Cyriacus, and did whatsoever he could against him.

6 The obseruable points of this confession our Reader will easily discern,
viz. Phocas a traitorous usurper, a bloody tyrant, is the Emperor, into whose
friendship Pope Boniface insinuates himself: who is now become a petitioner
for the universal primacie, and his adversary Cyriacus Patriarch of
Constantinople, grown into hatred and disgrace, because he abhorred the
tyranny of the same Phocas: who therefore contrary to the custom of his
predecessors, established Boniface in his new chair of universality: in which
term of head, Boniface apprehended more then peradventure was granted unto
him, viz. a pre-eminence not of degree only, but also of dominion over al
Christian Churches. Which we see first issued from the person of a wretched
tyrant, in hatred of a Patriarch abhorring his tyranny; and was forthwith
conferred upon a Pope both loving him, and favored of him, and that (which
argues the novelty of the grant) contrary to the custom of his
predecessors. By which we see, that our Doctor has been indeed partly refelled
in the terms, but in terms only, yet fully justified in the truth of his
assertion, notwithstanding their other Concerning Gregory, we have answered
before. As for the epistles of Vigilius, the^ are not of force: for the
epistles attributed unto the Popes of old times, are weakened much by the
suspicion of our Adversaries themselves.

CHAP. XII. Of Prayer for the dead.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
6 Sixthly, M. Whitaker gives example in Gregory the great, saying: Whitaker
contra Duraeum l. 7. p. 480.
He that first delivered Purgatory for a certain doctrine was Gregory the
great. Whereto in Gregory's full discharge from all innovation in this point we
answer, that S. Austen long before Gregory delivers the doctrine thereof for
most certain, saying: Aug. de verbis Apost. sermon. 34. says, Orati^nibus vero
sanctae Ecclesiae and sacrificio salutari and eleemosynis quae pro little
spiritibus erogantur, non est dubitandum mortuos adiuuari, vt cum iis
misericordius agatur a Domino, quam eorum pe^cata meruerunt, hoc enim a
patribus tra^itum vniuersa obseruat Ecclesia. And in his book de cura pro
mortuis, c. 1. he says of prayer for the dead, Non parua est vniuersae
^cclesiae quae in hac consuetudine claret authoritas.
It is not to be doubted but that the dead are helped by the prayers of the
holy Church, and the healthful sacrifice, and alms which are employed for
their souls, that God will deal with them more mercifully then their sins
deserved, for this does the universal Church observe as delivered from our
forefathers: and elsewhere he says no less certainly: Augu. in enchirid. c.
110. says, Neque negandum est defunctorum animas pictate suorum viuentium
releuari, cum pro illis sacrificium mediatoris offertur.
It may not be denied but that the souls of the deceassed are relieved by the
piety of their living friends, when for them is offered the sacrifice of the
mediator etc. In so much as he for the Latin Church doubted not to August*
haer. 35. says of Aerius* Fertur quoque propria dogmata addidisse nonnulla,
dicens orare vel offerre pro mortuis oblationem, non oportere.
censure Aerius for an heretic, for his denial of this doctrine: as also
Epiphanius for the Greek Church, condemns Aerius in like sort, saying
against him in defense of prayer and oblation for the dead, Epiphan. haer. 75.
and ibidem versus finem, he further says, Ecclesia necessario hoc perficit
traditione a patribus accepta.
The Church has received (this) through the wide world, it was agreed upon
before Aerius w^^* Hence it i^ that M. Fulke confesses and says: M. Fulke in
his answer to a counterfeit Catholic, page 44. finem.
Aerius taught that pra^er for the dead was unprofitable, as witness both
Epiphanius and Augustine, which they count for an error.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Inquiring what point of Prayer for the dead is most
truly Catholic.
SECT. 1.
Prayer for the dead, according to diverse respects, is more and less ancient:
for, as their own Cassander observes, Quamuis de statu illo animarum, quibus
haec prodessent, non satis constaret, nec inter omnes conueniret, omnes tamen
hoc officium vt testimonium charitatis erga defunctos, and vt professionem
fidei de immortalitate animarum, and futura resurrectione Deo g^atum and
Ecclesiae vtile iudicarunt. Cassander Consult. art. 24. page 225.
all did not agree about the state of man's soul, which might have benefit by
the prayers of the living. Which diversity we will methodically handle.

2 They considered the case of men's souls departed, either in the state of
damnation, or else in the state of salvation: and this latter in a double
respect, first as it is a misery subject unto a temporal grief, which some
Fathers thought to be eased and relieved by prayers: or secondly as it enjoys
rest; and this rest has been conceived by some Fathers to be in loco
refrigerij, in the place of ease and refreshing, which they call a common
receptacle of the souls of the elect without the court of heaven, there to
continue until the general resurrection. By others it is believed to be the
high palace of heaven, and fruition of the presence of God, and the Lamb
Christ Jesus. In all these different considerations we read in some Fathers
diverse manners of praying for their souls, and are therefore now to enquire
punctually what is amongst these the true Apostolic and Catholic doctrine.

3 First, the kind of prayers which are applied by some Fathers in behalf of
the Vere lachrymis digm lunt, -- frustni vixerunt imo non frustra sed in ^alum:
and de illis is tempestrue d^ce^ctur, vtile (...) illis si non f^^sssent nati.
-- ^t hic quantum vitae frustra insumplit, neque vaum diem vixit sibi, sed
voluptati, luxuriae, a^aritiae, peccato, d^abolo. Hoc igitur non plorabimus,
dic oro? non tentabimus nos ab his periculis eriper^? Est enim, si volucrimus,
illi leave facere supplicium. Itaque si preces pro illo faciati us continuas, si
elecmosynam denius, etsi ille ind^gnus sit, nob^s Deus placati^r er^t. Chrys^^t
him 21. in (...) 10. Tom. 3. and Damas^ene in ^rat. pro defanctis, where he
speaks of Tra^anes soul: and others. See above.
little case of the souls of the damned, the Romanists jointly with
Protestants, do freely and justly reject. The second form of prayers arises
only from the opinion, that some souls are in a paradise, without the quire
of heaven: which opinion of their estate because our Adversaries likewise See
above.
condemn, therefore ought they not to approve the prayers, which issued from
them in that only respect.

4 Two forms of prayers only remain, wherein we are further to insist. The
first is that which is applied unto souls that are conceived to be tormented
in the boiling fire of Purgatory. This is that which our Adversaries do
contend for.

5 The other, which, according unto ancient Liturgies, has been used for the
Saints in blessedness, in this form: See above lib 2. cap. 8. Sect. 2. in the
margent, at the letter, d.
Vouchsafe to remember those, who from generations have pleased thee in this
life, such as were the holy Fathers, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and the
blessed virgin Mary, together with all the Saints. Which kind of prayers our
Adversaries have interpreted to signify See above in the same place.
a thankful congratulation for the present joy of such Saints, or desires of
their future resurrection and consummation of bliss both in body and in
soul: This all Protestants do acknowledge to be a Catholic truth, and
practice it in the commemoration of the faithful departed, in testimony of
their hope of communion in blessedness, and faith of immortality: according
to the petition taught us in our Lords prayer, Let thy kingdom come, desiring
that Gods power may be acknowledged in us both in the kingdom of his grace in
this world, and in the kingdom of perfect glory in the resurrection of the
just: under which hope, even our bodies, do Romans 8. 22.
travel and groan until Act. 3. 19.
the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. If then we
shall tie our selves unto the scope of the question, as Ulysses unto his mast,
we shall not so easily be seduced with the terms of universal faith. Now we
enter upon

A particular examination of the doctrine of Aerius, and the reprehension of
Epiphanius.
SECT. 2.
6 Concerning Aerius it has been answered, that we are to put a difference
between the public actions of the Church, and the private interpretations c
B. Bilson in his government of the Church, cap. 13.
of the two forenamed Fathers: the public actions were the commemoration and
thanksgiving in the testimony of our hope, even for Martyrs: and although
Epiphanius and some others did doubtfully think that the same men's damnation
might be mitigated by prayer, howsoever their state could not be altered; yet
these speculations were not comprised in the public prayers of the Church, nor
confirmed by them, and for that cause was he justly impugned for condemning the
universal and religious actions of the Catholic Church.

7 Again, Aerius was offended with the vulgar opinion of those times, which
thought, that Si vero ommno preces little, qui hic sunt, prosunt illis qui
isthic sunt igitur nemo fit pius, qui boni quicquam faciat, sed acquirat amicos
quosdam per quem vult modum, aut per pecumas persuadens, aut amicis id in obitu
demandans, and orent pro ipso, vt ne quid illic patiatur, neque immedicabilia
peccata ab ipso perpetrata requirantur. Epiphan. haeres. 75 ante medium.
although a man lived never so wickedly, yet if he could procure some men
either by money, or by friendship, or howsoever, to pray for him after his
death, he might be freed from punishment due unto him for his sins after his
death. And this opinion he falsely and calumniously imputed unto the Church, and
thereupon questioned, Whether the prayers of the living do (...) that is,
altogether profit the dead. Unto this question Epiphanius returns an answer,
signifying that by mentioning the names of the dead this profit is gained, viz.
Postea vero quae proferantur nomina vita defunctorum, quid hoc magis fuerit
vtile? quid hoc commodius, and magi, admiratione dignum? quod credunt
praesentes quod hi qui praecesserunt, viuunt, and non sunt nulh, sed sunt and
vmunt apud Dominum: and vt pientiss. praedicationem recenseam, quod spes est
orantibu^ pro frat^ibus, velut qui in peregrinatione sunt. Prosunt autem and
preces pro ipsis factae, etiamsi totam culpam non abscu^dant. Epiphanius ibid.
ante fi^m, And as (...) notes: Epiphanius docet orationes quae fiunt pro
delunctis, prodesse, sed non dicit prodesse defunctis -- quia per eas id quod
est perfectius significatur, etc.
Thereby we believe that the souls departed live with the Lord. The second
profit, is in respect of those souls of the unjust, by entreating pardon for
them: but how? (...), altogether? (for that was the question,) no: Epiphanius
says, they prosite, (...), that is, although they do not cut off the whole
sin. This, we see, is but half an answer, leaving the other in suspense, and
yet this is all that Epiphanius answers.

8 If this Father had believed Purgatory, here the question of Aerius
challenged him to have expressed himself, in yielding a full answer according
unto the now Romish The question was (...) the remission (...), as for the
punishment: the Romanists speak only of remission of punishment: the question
was of mortal sins not remitted in this life the Romanists only defend a
profit after remission ^f guilt ^f the mortal.
faith, and to have said (if he had so believed,) that Prayer for the dead is
profitable for the deliverance of souls out of the scorching fire of
Purgatory: but there is not one syllable, which has any sent of so much as the
smoke of that sire. Furthermore if Aerius had been an heretic for denying of
this article, their Alphonsus de Alphonsus (...).
Castro, who noted the her^sies of Aerius, would not, in all probability, have
spared him in this.

An answer unto the testimony of S. Augustine.
SECT. 3.
9 Our Authors have observed S. Augustine to have been the first who opened the
window unto the doctrine of Purgatory: by whose own direction we have a good
warrant to dissent from him, or any other Ita alios (Script^ras) (praeter
Canonicos) lego, vt non verum putem, quia ipsi ita senserint, quantalibet etiam
sanctitate doctrinaue praepolleant; sed quia mihi vel per illos autores
Canonicos, vel probabili ratione, quod a vero non abhorreat, persuadere
potuerint. August. ^epist. 19. ad Hieron. Nullorum hominum quatnuis
Catholicorum and laudatorum velut Scripturas Canonicas habere debemus, vt non

labor to persuade any thing either without Canonical Authors, or without
probable reason. Which exception both we and our Adversaries have justly taken
against the doctrine of S. Augustine, concerning the necessity of See above.
ministering the Eucharist unto infants, albeit he held it to be both as
general, and as necessary as he did this point now in question.

10 But much more are we moved hereunto by his practice, when we find him
praying for remission for his mothers soul, that God would not enter into
judgment with her, even then when he confesses, saying: Nunc pro peccatis
matris meae deprecortc, exaudi me per medicinam vulnerum tuorum quae pependit
in cruce, and sedens ad dextram tuam, te interpellat pro nobis, Dimittc,
Domine, dimitte, obsecro, ne intres cum ea in iudicium. Sed credo quod iam
feceris quod te rogo: sed voluntaria oris mei approba Domine, Aug. lib. 9.
Confess. cap. 13.
I bele^ue, O Lord, that thou have already done that I desired:
notwithstanding accept, O Lord, the willing sacrifice of my mouth. Which
argues that it was rather a wish then a prayer, and therefore may peradventure
be thought (as he himself noted some Catholics in an other opinion) to have
been an error proceeding from natural affection. And why not, seeing he
himself has been doubtful whether there be See above lib. 1. cap. 7.
any Purgatory fire, or no? and in other material points so questionable, that
our Adversaries cannot allow of his doubts, as Sed quibus (speaking of the
state of the damned) placet istam sententum vsque ad illa impiorum tormenta
protendere, saltem sic intelligant, vt manente in eis ira Dei, quae in aeterno
est praenunciata supplicio, non contine at Deus in hac ira sua miserationes
suas, and faciat eos non tanta quanta digni sunt poenarum atrocitate cruciari,
non vt eas poenas vel nunquam subeant, vel vt aliquando finiant, sed vt eas
mitiores quam merita sunt little, leuioresque patiantur -- quod quidem non ideo
confirmo, quia non resisto. August. de Ciuit. Dei, lib. 21. c. 24. which is
condemned by S. Greg. Dial. lib. 4. c. 44. Non enim omnibus prosunt, Et quare

the testimony of Dionysius Areopagita, and the Romish example in praying for

further evidence hereof we proceed.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Also he acknowledges that M. Fulke in his confutation of Purgatory, page 320.
ante med. and pa. 194. ante med. and page 326. initio. and 349. circa and post
med.
Ambrose, Chrysostom, and Augustine allowed prayer for the dead, that M. Fulke
vbi supra, p. 320. ante med. and pa. 326. initio. and 349. post med. and page
78. fine.
it was the common error of their time, that M. Fulke vbi supra, page 161 ante

Tertullian, Augustine, Cyprian, Hierome, and a great many more do witness
that sacrifice for the dead is the tradition of the Apostles. In like manner M.
Giff^rd affirms, that even M. George Gifford in his Plain demonstration that
our Br^wnists be full Donatisti, etc. page 38. initio.
in the (Churches) public worship, to pray for the souls of the dead, and to
offer oblation for the dead was general in the Church long before the days of
Augustine, as appears in Cyprian and Tertullian, which was before him and
nearer to the time of the Apostles. Whereunto might be added like testimony
from Calvin. Calvin Institut. lib. 3. cap. 5. sect. 10. acknowledges that,
Ante mill and tre^ent. annos, vs^receptum fuit vt precationes fierent pro
defunctis: and a little after, Sed fateor in errorem abrepti suerunt, etc.
So clear ^s Gregory (who lived so many ages after these Fathers) discharged
from all innovation in this point.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 4.
12 Justly might M. Gifford affirm, that praying and offering oblations for
the dead, was general in the Church long before the days of S. Augustine.
What ergo? Ergo they believed a Purgatory torment of souls departed: for this
is the confused mixture of the Apologists, as though there were no other use of
prayers and oblations for the dead, but only thereby to mitigate or to quench
the flame of Purgatory: but this is an unlearned collection, and dissonant from
the practice of the Greek Church, which (as their Durantus confesses from
Epiphanius, Cyrill, and the Greek Canon) Sane apud Epiphanium haerel. ^5. and
Cv^ill. Catcch. ^. Mystag. and in Canone Graecoru^ legitur offerri lacrificium
Deo pro Patriarchis, Apostolis, Prophetis, huangelistis and Martyribus,

Ofte^imus pro Martyribus non intelligitur, quod eos Deo comme^demus, verum in
oblatio^e commem^remus Martyrs, in little gloriam, and gratiarum actionem. --
Propterea, vt Cabasila ait, nihil pro ijs orat Sacerdos, sed potius cos or^t,
vt ab^j^ in orationibus adiuuetur, quia non ad supplicationem, sed gratiarum
actionem, vt dictum est, facit pro ipsis donorum oblationem, in little gloriam.
Offer^itaque pro Martyribus interpretamur, pro ^orum gloria. Durantu^ de
ritibus, lib. 2. cap. 35. page 406.
did use prayers and sacrifice for Apostles, holy Martyrs, yea and for the
blessed virgin Mary. Which our Adversaries interpret to signify no
supplications, but thanksgiving for the glory which they enjoy. Even as the
Latin Church (as appears not only by the aforesaid testimony of S.
Augustine, but also by Pope Innocentius the third) commanded Quia in sanctae
matris Ecclesiae side, and Christi nominis confessione perfeuer auit (speaking
de Presbyte^o non baptizato) -- coelestis Patria gaudium esse adeptum asserimus
incunctanter. -- Et in ^cclcsia tua iuges preces ho^^^asque Deo offerri iubeas

daily prayers and oblations to be offered for the soul of a Priest; whom he
notwithstanding affirms even the^ to have obtained the toycs of heaven. So
that from the act of prayer to conclude a fire of Purgatory, does iumpe no
better then heaven and hell.

13 Unto the objected Fathers we answer, that See above the other examples in
Valentinian and Theodosius, lib. 1.
Ambrose is forced to say more then he means: S. Chrysostom says more then
they themselves will allow, which is, by prayers to yield Die mihi quae spes

ease unto the damned in hell. As for Purgatory fire, it is quite quenched by
the form of Service in their funerals, where we read of nothing but hymns
and songs, and crowns, and rest for the souls of the departed. Upon which
consideration S. Chrysostom expostulateth with his people for using excessive
lamentation at the burials, and says: Dic mihi (speaking of Christians, who
wept immoderatly for their dead) quid sibi volunt istae lampades tam

in commemoration of them (as he also shows in his own testimony,) and not
for purgation of sin: for his conclusion is, that the just are called to
refreshing, but the wicked to punishment: fancying no third state, but gives
general instruction unto every Christian, to believe with Simeon, that they
are to depart in peace. But how? in the peace of conscience only to think that
after the torment of Purgatory sustained, they shall enjoy eternal felicity?
No, but the peace of S. Paul: To die it is an advantage, because they are
delivered out of temptations of sins, and vexations of this life, and out of
the snare of the Devil, passing unto eternal felicity. But Bomish Purgatory
has (in the opinion of our Adversaries) only a bonum tormenti so great as
exceeds all the torments of this world. He therefore that said, that the error
of Purgatory was but rifely budded in the days of S. Augustine, who lived in
the fourth hundred year after Christ, does grant that (in respect of true
antiquity) it was but a new plant.

15 Now then, seeing the question is not who first conceited of Purgatory, for
then a man may fetch it from Plato among the Philosophers, from Virgil among
the Poets, and from Origin (for deliverance of souls of the damned) among the
Fathers, and for souls in rest from other Fathers: but that which is taught by
the Romanists is a fiery Purgatory torment of souls, whose guilt of mortal
sins has been pardoned. This doctrine (as See above l. 1. c. 2.. 14.
has been conf^ssed) neither Greek Fathers, nor yet generally the Latin
Church in the primitive age thereof, did receive. S. Augustine spoke with a
peradventure, but S. Greg. Dial. lib. 4. c. 40. and 55. from apparitions of
ghosts, which ground in Scripture is held abominable, Deuteronomy. 18. 12.
Gregory kindled the fire with a credo, from a presumption taken from ghostly
apparitions, condemned by antiquity: and now of late the Romanists have blown
the flame with an Anathema (upon the contradictor) making it a necessary
article of faith.

16 To all which we answer, embracing S. Augustines general resolution in like
cases: Legate hoc nobis ex Lege, ex Euangelio, ex literis Apostolicis, and
credemus. For we find not in Canonical Scripture, either any express precept
to pray for souls departed, or example of any that has prayed for them; or
yet any promise of blessing upon any prayers made in that behalf: and
therefore are we persuaded that many of our Adversaries do no less doubtfully
believe this article of Purgatory, then they can tell what souls are in
Purgatory, and how long they continue in that place of torment: which they
confess to have been Fuit opinio Dominici a Soto in 4. sent. did. 19. q. 3

CHAP. XIII. Of the novelty of Romish doctrine, concerning the absolute
necessity of auricular confession.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
7 Seventhly, M. Whitaker gives example in Innocentius the third, affirming,
that Whitaker contra Duraeum lib. 7. page 480. post medium.
He was the first that instituted auricular confession for necessary: whereto we
answer that an innovation so strange and compulsorie, as for men (against all
natural shamefastness) to be constrained to confess their secret sins,
could never have been brought in by man's only authority, without some open and
great contradiction: If therefore Innocentius first brought in this usage
before that time strange and untaught, what Father or other writer of that age
then resisted it? or who is witresse to the change? Herein M. VVbitaker is
silent.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
AGainst the assertion of our Doctor they contend by three arguments: the first
is from natural shamefastness, the second from light of the history, and the
third from the authority of ancient Fathers.

2 At the first we are constrained to marvel why this confession of secret
sins should seem to be so singularly strange and compulsarie unto any that
has true sense of his own sin, as though that were altogether repugnant
unto a natural man, which is found to be in practice among the infidels
themselves: for Illud merito mi ari quisqua possit, confessionem peccatorum
etiam occu^torum and grauium celebri vsu apud hosce Barbaros long ante Christi
Euangelium auditum frequentatam. Erant Sacerdotes non pauci huic ipsi muneri
assignati, qui plebis audiendi^ confessionibus vacarent. -- At illud non
admirationem, sed stuporem mihi propemodum affert, valuisse tantum, diaboli
hominumque mendacium apud homines, vt non solum occulta crimina proderent, sed
saeus etiam poenas sibi pro eis iniungi aequo animo paterentur. Iubebantur
saepe expiandi adulterij, aut alicuius sceleris causa durissimo saxo ad
scapulas tundi, fortiter interdum a iuuenibus diu virgis caedi: non ra^o, si
sceleris magnitudo aliquid postulare videretur acerbius, in excelsam, atque
omni genere solatij destituram rupem secedre, and longum aeuum ibi ferarum more
traducere -- quod viti side digni ostenderunt, etc. Acosta Ies. lib 6. de
Indorum salute, cap. 12.
among the Indian Paganes (says the Jesuit Acosta, not without wondering)
auricular confession was in use, wherein the heathen laid open to their Priests
their secret and heinous crimes; and not this only, but did also inflict
punishment upon themselves for the expiation of their sins, suffering
themselves to be whipped of young men with rods. And if the ugliness of the
fault required so much, to betake themselves into desert places, where, after
the manner of beasts, they spent their whole life within the holes of rocks.

3 Neither yet is this to be wondered at: for it is natural unto a man
oppressed with sin, to be apprehensiue of any thing that shall be thought to
assuage the grief of conscience. For we marvel not why 1. King. 18. 28.
Baals priests did lance their own flesh in prayer with knives, or why other
Idolaters, against nature, did offer up their children to be sacrificed unto
Leuit. 20. 2.
Moloch, giving up the fruits of their bodies for the sins of their souls. For
if the diseases of the body compel some to put off common shamefastness, and
to yield their less honorable parts unto the view of the Physician: how much
less shall the afflicted soul strain courtesy with natural shamfastnesse,
as soon as the afflicted conscience shall but conceive any hope of ease. It is
the property of a sore and sorrow to call any thing necessary, wherein there
is any means of comfort and health.

4 But then will this confession become more natural, when as the confessor
shall look only unto the opus operatum, and be persuaded, that, as it was
said unto Naaman the Leper, 2. Kings 5. 10.
Wash and be clean, so it is no more but confess and be safe. Which
peradventure was the conceit of those conuerts of India, who presumed so much
of the power of absolution by the act of consession, that thereby they took
unto themselves a license of wallowing in sin. Which occasioned a Divine
among them to wish that the Sea above lib. 2. cap. 14. Sect. 7.
auricular confession were utterly abolished. So that, whether we respect the
penitencie, or else the presumptuousnesse of a sinner, we see no cause why the
natural man should so utterly abhor this kind of confession. We return unto
Innocentius.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
But to clear Innocentius who was Pope about Anno 1200: it is evident that the
Iacobites were condemned Anno 600, for affirming that Witness hereof Guido de
lacobitis, c. 2. and Michael Buchingerus in Ecclesiastica historia: And Matheus
Parisius in Henrico tertio; and Iacobus Vitriacus historiae orientalis, c. 76.
and Nicephorus l 18 c. 45.
we are to confess our sins to God only, and that confession of sins to a
Priest is not needful. And Haymo Hairr^ in Psalm 31. says, Licet Deus dimittat
peccata, etc. tamen confitendum est Ministris Ecclesiae, quia nisi
confiterentur, ex suain^bedientia damnarentur: and no less plain is he (ad
Euangelium Dominicae, 15. post Pentecosten^te ostendite vos sacerdotibus.
who lived about Anno 790, expresses the like agreeable doctrine of the Church
in his time: as also S. Bernard Bernard in meditationibus, c. 9. says, Sed
dicis sufficit mihi soli Deo confiteri, quia Sacerdos sine eo a peccata me
absoluere non potesi: ad quod non ego sed beatus Iacobus respondet, dicens,
confitemini alterutrum peccata restra, etc. And vide eum de interiori domo, c.

, Petrus Damianus, and others Council.* Cabi^onense (which was Anno 813.) can.
32. says, Sed and hoc emendatione egere perspeximus, quod quidam dum
confitentur peccata sua Sacerdotibus, non plen^ id saciunt, etc. And Alcuinus
who lived anno 730. I de diuinis officis, c. 13. in c. Ieiunij, says,
Conf^tea^^^ omnia peccata sua quae recordari potest etc. quo facto fixis
genibus in terram, and super ipsa innixus stans supplicibus tensis manibus,
blando ac flexibili vultu respiciens sacerdotem, dicat etc. And see Aug. de
visitatione infirmorum l 2 c 4. and l. 50. homiliarum, hom. 49. c. 3. and
Hospinianus in historia sacramentaria l. 4. page 366. circa med. reproves the
same doctrine of au^^cular confession in Peter Lombard, who (says he) lived
anno 1150. and also in Hugo de Sancto Victore, who lived (says he) about the
year 1130. both of them before Innocent the third.
who all lived before Innocent the third, do the like for their times. Petrus
Damianus epist. 1. alleges a notable example in proof hereof: (and vide eum
in sermon. 2. de S. Andrea Apostolo) and concludes, aduising men not to deserre
their confession.


THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
5 Necessarily must we distinguish of necessity, which is either in part, or
else absolute, as it is in Physic, that which may recover my health is partly
necessary, but that is absolutely necessary, without which I cannot be
healed. The former, Protestants have in some cases acknowledged to be
requisite: and for the second, which teaches, that without the act or purpose
of this manner of confession a man cannot be be saved: they have charged Pope
Innocentius the third of nouelty, and that truly, as may appear by his own
decree, which is this: Atque Innocentius tertius constituit, vt qui iam doli
capaces esse coepissent, si non saepius, at semel quotannis confiterentur
peccata illis Sacerdotibus, qui eorum ammatum curam haberent. Polyd. Virgil.

l. 4. page 367. Surius Tom. 3. in Conc. Lateran. sub Innocent. 3. cites the
same 21. Canon.
Every one of both sex, after he be come unto the years of discretion, shall
at least once in a year confess alone unto the Priest: or otherwise to be
excommunicate, whilst he lives, and being dead, be denied Christian burtall.
This was his doctrine of necessity.

6 Now let us see how the Apologists have freed Innocentius from the note of
innovation. Can the instance of the Iacobits satisfy herein? No: for (if there
had been any such opinion in them) Cardinal Bellarmine would have thought it
worthy the noting, especially where he does brand Protestants with ancient
heresies.

7 As for the other testimonies from Authors, who lived about the same
Centurie, they are not sufficient to prove the generality of doctrine; because
it cannot be denied that not long before the days of Innocentius this matter
was disputable, as appears by their Gratian, (he living about the year 1198,
which is about 50 years before the forenamed Innocentius,) who relating the
contrary opinion, leaves the case as indifferent: Quibus authoritatibus vel
rationibus vtraque sententia confessionis and satifactionis innitatur, in
medium breuit^r expo^uimus. Cui enim horum potius adhaerendum sit, Lectoris
iudicio reseruatur. Vtraque enim fautores habet sapientes and (...) viros Haec
Gratian. in fine did. 1. de Poenit. Test Hospinian. quo supra, page 366.
Whether side (says he) we are rather to yield unto, I refer unto the
readers judgment, because there be wise religious men on both sides. The
Council of Cabilon holds it profitable, not necessary, which was made so
general by Innocentius the third: except our Adversaries can show some better
antiquity. b The Authors cited for the heresy of the Iacobites (excepting the
late Papists, who were n^ less partial herein then are the Apologists)
m^sapply it as does Apolog. some of them relate it, but so, as signifying that
the Iacobites did speak generally against confession made unto the Church, and
so, by the judgment of Protestants, were worthily condemned. If the case had
been otherwise, the Apologists would not have silenced their express
testimony, and send us to the whole (...) to find it, we know not where, as in
Matthaeus Paris. de Hen. 3. and not tell us what confession it was the
Iacobites did (...), whether the general or particular, whether the public or
the private, whether in the partly or in the absolute necessity.

secret confession.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Answering unto the testimonies of Basil and Leo.
SECT. 3.
8 Pope Leo in his testimony shows only the lawfulness of Leo des^^ibeth
the usage of the Latin Church, C^st 91. ad Theodorum foro-Iulij Episcopum,
saying, Christus hanc Ecclesiae praepositis tradidit potestatem vt and
confiten^hus actionem poenitentiae darent, and cosdem salubri satisfactione

And Epist. 80. ad Episcopos Campaniae, he further says, Cum reatus
conscientiarum sufficiat solis Sacerdotibus indicari confessione secreta.
secret confession, but not the absolute necessity.

9 The other testimony out of S. Basil seems to be more opposite, but yet
may be satisfied from it self, because he speaks of such a confession of
sins, as the Necessarium est, vt ijs fiat con^essio peccatorum, quibus
dispen^atio mysteriorum Dei concredita est. Na^ and hoc pacto and qui olim
inter Sanctos poenitentiam egerunt, secisse repe^iuntur: sc^iptum enim est in
^uangelio, quod Ioha^^^ Baptistae pec^ata confessi sunt: in Actis vero,

sins in general, and not in particular; or of particular sins, but in
public, and not in private, as their own great Cardinal Caietane is
acknowledged to have taught: which point is grown to be among our Adversaries
a matter of great dispute.

10 For (as their Jesuit Act. 19. 18. Multique credentium venicbant
consitentes and annunciantes actus suos.] Caietanus credit ista consessionem
non fuisse Sacramentu^, ed tantum in genere, vel publica, qualis erat eorum qui

question is whether omnia peccata in specie are to be confessed the prec^^deth.

cogeretur. Augustinus in Psalm 61. idem significat. Arator autem diserte ita
sentit, aitque hoc miraculo venisse ad Baptismum, and illos, qui combusserant
libros, id fecisse. vt impetrarent Baptismum: Ast alij magicis ponunt incendia
libris, vt mercantur aquas, and vitent ignibus ignes, etc. Hactenus Lorinus
Ies. com. in Act. 19. verse. 18. page 784.
Lorinus does observe) many Romish Doctors and Jesuits of principal name among
the^, to wit, Canisius, Gregory de Valentia, Henriques, Lindane, Castro,
Hosius, Taper, Ecchius, Soto, Catharine, Baronius, Salmeron, besides many
others, do all out of the place of Act. 19. centend to prove auricular
confession. Lorinus being by the judgment of such a multitude of authors (as
himself speaks) terrified, dares neither condes^end unto Baronius his certum
est, for the auouching of auricular confession out of this place, nor yet will
yield unto Caietane his proculdubio, for the contiarie exposition.

11 Nevertheless the objected place of Basil (whereby Canisius labored to
euince, that the parties who confessed unto the Apostles in the Acts, were
baptized before they had confessed, and consequently that this was a
sacramental confession) was so far off from Basils intention, that their said
learned Jesuit Lorinus feared not otherwise to inform us: I am deceived
(says he) if that basil do not teach the contrary, which he shows to be the
more probable, by the connection which Basil makes with the Jewish confession
unto John Baptist (which was not sacramental,) adding that no ancient Divines
did prove the sacramental confession out of that Scripture of the Acts: yea
and diverse have denied that it can be proved thereby, or (as one further
teaches) out of the testimony of S. Basil, who defends only a necessity
of repentance, and not of confession. We find nothing in this their dispute but
their usual even and odd, yea and nay, and all about that which cannot be
found.

speaking of the ancient Churches usage even in those former times of Cyprian

private confession even of thoughts and lesser sins: and that it was as then
commanded and thought necessary. So greatly is M. Whitaker mistaken in this
example.

precept, nor practiced by the primitive Church, nor held as necessary in the
Greek Church; nor defended by Tertullian, or Cyprian. Seeing the^ the doctrine
hereof is a novelty of aftertimes, whether D. Whitaker had reason to ascribe
it unto some few Doctors, who not long before Innocentius taught it (being yet
in those times questioned of,) rather than unto Pope Innocentius, who
authorized it for a doctrine of public and general profession in the Church,
let the prudent reader judge.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
8 Eighthly, M. Whitaker gives example in Pope Nicholas the second, saying of
him: (d) Qui primus docuit corpus Christi sensualiter tractari, frangi and
dentibus atteri, (r) Whitaker contra Duraeum lib. 7. page 480.
is Nicholaus secundus fuit: VVhereto we answer. 1. First that the matter
hereof is already sufficiently answered by that which has been heretofore
said concerning the fourth former example of Transubstantiation, and the
confessed antiquity thereof in many Fathers, who lived long before Pope
Nicholas the second: 2. Secondly, concerning the phrase (which is but a verbal
objection) S. Chrysostom (many ages before Pope Nicholas) said in like manner,
Chrysostom in Math. hom. 83. post med.
Ipsum vides, Ipsum tangis, Ipsum comedis. And elsewhere, Chrysostom. in John
hom. 45 post med.
Non se tantum videri permittet desiderantibus, sed and tangi and manducari,
and dentes carni suae infigi. And in what true and sober sense, these words may
(in regard As S. Paul in like regard says, This is my body which is broken for
you, 1. Cor. 11. 24. And Calvin de Coena Dom. inter opuscula, says in like
manner: John Paptist says, he saw the holy Ghost descending; if we look
narowly, we shall find he saw nothing but a Dove, etc. Yet because he knew that
(...) to be etc. a most certain sign of the presence of the holy Ghost, he
boldly affirms that he saw him, etc. As the holy Ghost is in regard of this
foresaid presence said to be seen and to descend: so may Christ's body in
regard of it like pres^nce in the Sacrament, be likewise said to be handled,
broken, etc.
of Christ's body really present in the Sacrament) be used, is at large affirmed
by our adversaries the Lutheranes, who doubt not specially to Iacobus Andreas
in confut. disput. Johan. Iacobi Grinaei, page 214. ante med. says, Quomodo

defend against their other brethren our adversaries, this very objection
concerning Pope Nicholas.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
IN the question of Transubstantiation our Reply has met with your answer,
but how sufficiently, we refer it unto our Readers censure. We now come to
examine the phrase of speech.

2 The form of recantation, prescribed unto Berengarius, was in these words:
Ego Berengarius etc. -- Consentio autem sanctae Romans Ecclesiae, and Apostolicae
sedi, and orc and cord consiteor de Sacramentis Dominicae men sae endem sidem
me tencre, quam Dominus and venerabilis Papa Nicolaus, and haec sancta Synodus
authoritate Euangelica and Apostolica tenendam tradidit, mihique firmauit,
scilicet panem and vinum, quae in altari ponuntur, post consecrationem non
solum Sacramentum, sed etiam verum corpus and sanguinem Domini nostri Jesus
Christi esse; and sensualiter non solum Sacramentum, sed in veritate manibus
Sacerdotum tractari, frangi, and sidelium dentibus atteri. Surius Conc. Tom. 3.
page 600.
I Berengarius do profess, that I hold the same faith which the venerable Pope
Nicholas and his holy Synod does prescribe to be believed, to wit, that the
bread and wine which are set on the altar, are after consecration not only a
Sacrament, but also the very body and blood of Christ, and are sensibly
handled and broken by the hands of the Priests, and torn with the teeth of the
faithful communicants. This his tenor of reconciliation our Adversaries have
showed to have bin approved by Hanc confessionem suae fidei de corpore and
sanguine Domini nostri Jesus Christi a Berengario Romae coram 114. Episcopis
factam, misit Papa Nicolaus per vibes Italiae, Germaniae, Galliae, and ad
quaecunque loca fama prauitatis eius pervenire ante potuit, vt Ecclesiae, quae
prius doluerant de aue^so and peruerso, postea gaudeant de reuerso atque
conuerso. Decret. 3. part. de Consecrat. did. 2. Ego Berengarius: and Binius
Tom. 3. page 1286.
Pope Nicholas, by whom it was sent throughout all the coasts of Italy,
Germany, and France, for the manifestation of Berengarius his conversion.
Albeit the form hereof be such, that their own Romish Gloss feared not to
censure it thus: If thou do not cautelously understand these words, thou shall
fall into a greater heresy then was that for which Berengarius was condemned.
Gladly therefore would we understand the true exposition hereof.

3 The Apologists, for our satisfaction, bring in Chrysostom speaking of our
receiving of Christ in the Eucharist, and saying: Ipsum vides, etc. Thou see
Christ herein, thou feel him, and eatest him, who suffers thy teeth to be
fixed in his flesh. They might have added from the same Father, See above lib.
2. cap. 2. Sect. 17. lit. o.
that our tongs are made red with Dentibus. Nisi sanc^ intelligas verba
Berengarij (meaning of his form of recantation) in ma^orem incides haeresin,
quam ipse fuerit: imo omnia referes ad species ipsas, nam de Christi corpore
parts non facimus. Glossa in Decret. 3. part. de Consecrat. did. 2. Ego
Berengarius.
his blood. We demand, are these speeches to be understood literally and
properly, or improperly and figuratively? If properly, why do they call this
but a verbal objection? if improperly, why then have our Adversaries objected
these literal speeches of Chrysostom for proof of Ibid.
Transubslantiation? and why did their Gloss censure the form of speech
approved by Pope Nicholas, according to the literal sense thereof, to be no
better then heretical?

4 But in as much as the Apologists have thus favorably qualified these
term^s, they must suffer themselves to be instructed, that those testimonies
which have been produced out of the Fathers, and pressed in the rigor of the
phrase, have not been much better then verbal objections.

5 What then shall be said in behalf of our Doctors, concerning Pope Nicholas
his idiome of speech, who, for proof of Transubstantiation, authorized the
phrase of tearing the flesh of Christ with our teeth? Shall this be thought as
excusable as the sayings of Chrysostom, and be deemed nothing but verbal
objections? No, no, the difference is great: for our Adversaries themselves
will have us to mark and Animaduertere debemus diligenter and distinguere, in
lectione Patrum, quae ab illis contentiose, id est, occasion praesentis
certaminis, in quo eorum disputatio vertatur, and ad aliam long diuersam

lectori cordato and perito iudicium, non autem in isto posteriori. Stapleton.
Do^trin. princip. contr^^^r. 3. lib ^. cap. 16. page 267.
observe diligently when the Fathers speak things in the way of contention,
and when they deliver a doctrine definitive with a determination; in the former
manner of their speech, the Reader (say they) owes no belief unto them, but
in the second. And there is no such nouice which has perused the Fathers
writings, but knows that in their sermons unto the people, they take a
liberty in their speeches by excess and by allusions, to make their
exhortations and persuasions more emphatical, which in their determinations of
matters of faith they did religiously avoid; eue^ as it is in the common acts
of men, who when they write a letter of commendations, can speak freely; but
in an Indenture or Obligation, it behooves them to be more caurelous for fear
of a writ of error. So here, if Pope Nicholas had been exercised in a Sermon,
such phrases might pass for figurative; but now that an express form of
reconciliation, and a determination of an article of their Church was to be
enjoined as a definitive direction for all others, in this point of faith the
Popes sentence cannot admit this Apology, but stands still guilty of an
innovation.

THE ROMISH APOLOGISTS CONCLUSION.
Master Whitaker having thus failed in every one of those examples whereof
he made bold to give instance, and the Roman Church being found therein free
from all supposed change or innovation:

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 3.
4 If the Apologists had but intended what could have been replied against
their proofs, they might have foreseen (which now they may perceive) that
notwithstanding their former instances, the first excommunicating of all
foreign Churches, for dissent in ceremonies, lies upon Pope Victor: and the
claim of Appeals from transmarine countries, already questioned of, upon
Pope Sozimus: the first absolute decree against the marriage of all
Ecclesiastical persons, upon Pope Syricius: the first authorizing of
Transubstantiation for a general doctrine of faith, upon Pope Innocentius the
third: the first usurpation of the title of universal head for jurisdiction
over all Christian Churches, upon Pope Boniface the third: the first delivering
of Purgatorie-fire for a doctrine of faith, upon Pope Gregory the first: the
first proclaiming auricular confession to be a doctrine generally and
absolutely necessary for man's salvation, upon Innocentius the third: the first
doctrine of a sensual manner of receiving of the body of Christ in the
Eucharist, so as to tear it with our teeth, upon Pope Nicholas the second: and
the adding the fourth fast unto the three, upon Pope Calixtus. Yet are not
these the tenth part of Innouations, whereof the Church of Rome has been
guilty: which the Apologists, by their next pursuit, will enforce us to
reveal.

How much the rather now are we to esteem it no less cleared from change in

several examples concerning one and the same question, as namely concerning
the blessed Sacrament, and the Popes foresaid Primacie. In all which
nevertheless he had so little trust, and did so well foreknow the
discouerable weakness thereof, that he elsewhere protests plainly, that he

same, therefore quite against his own former examples, and in proof that it
cannot be showed, he alleges similitudes of Whitaker cont. Camp. rat. 7. p.

buildings at the first become an outward and markable ruin, whereas in
doctri^e eue^y opinion is at the first either true or false: 2. Secondly, the
first whiteness of some few hairs and the first decay in buildings cannot be
at the first discerned, though they were precisely regarded, which is otherwise
in change of doctrine: 3. Thirdly, none is specially charged so precisely to
mark these, whereas on the contrary, it is the special charge, not of a few,

showing the first beginning of so great a change as is by them imagined (which
is all that by these foresaid misapplied resemblances, our adversaries do
wrongfully urge) nevertheless at the least yet, we are in all reason to
expect, that (according to the nature of these their own examples) For though
the first white hair or slifter be not discerned, yet the further degrees and
increase thereof are markable and discerned.
they should discover and describe to us some proceedings and increase of this
supposed change. If therefore they say that this change was not made all at

another, then are they accordingly to show forth those several little changes
or some degrees of the increase and proceedings thereof. As what be those
several points of faith so by degrees at several times changed, which be the

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Concerning the state of this question.
SECT. 1.
WE are now brought unto the challenge of all challenges in this question of
antiquity, which is, to notify the change of the Romish Religion. The
demonstration hereof may be of two sorts, either (...), or (...): that is,
either negatiuely, to show when any doctrine was not, or positiuely, to point
out the very time when the change first began. Our adversaries are not
contented with the first, but exact of Protestants a positive demonstration,
which Cardinal Bellarmine describes by several adjuncts, saying: in omni
insigni mutatione Religionis, semper ista sex demonstrari possunt, 1. author,
2. dogma aliquod nonum, 3. tempus, 4. locus, 5. quis, 6. eriguus caetus vnde
coeperit; nam illa omnia inuenimus in ipsa Christi Ecclesia, quae tame^ non
fuit noua Ecclesia, sed solum mutatio quaedam status Ecclesiae secundum
Prophetarum praedictiones. -- Quod vero nihil horum de nobis ostendere possint,
perspicuum est. Bellar. l. 4. de Eccles. milit. c. 5.. In omni.
In every notable change of Religion, six points were always obserueable.
viz. the Author who, the doctrine what, the time when, place where, person by
whom the risisting was made, and the small number of professors thereof at the
first, even as they are discernable in the beginning (as he says) of Christian
Religion: and then he assumeth, that no one of all these circumstances of
innovation can be showed in the Church of Rome. Which argument is held of other
Quid absurdius quam Romanam Ecclesiam innumeris pene haeresibus refertam
vociferari, quarum ne vna quo Pontifice, qua via qua vi, quibus incrementis
vrbem and orbem inuaserit, queas demonstrate. Duraeus Ies. in defens. Campian
against Whitaker, fol. 180. and 181.
Romanists as the principal, palmarie, and indeed the alone sufficient for
their defense, which is now again recocted by these. Apologists, whilst that
they urge us to show the several little changes, or some a^gree of the increase
and proceedings thereof. Which argument they further seek to fortify by our
Authors confession, but altogether Rem sine verbo Dei, sine vllo exemplo,
praesumptionibus and coniecturis incertissimis adfirmari -- viz
Vicissitudinariam praesidentiam fuisse mutatam -- per vniuersum orbem, and
justice de causis: sed a quibus and quando hoc fieri coeptum est, fateri pudet,
ne praeuaricari videatur. Sarauia, loco citato. The point is the annual change
of the Elders, which being no doctrinall point, but a rituall and
circumstantiall, the matter is impertinent unto our purpose. So likewise the
testimony borrowed from Archbishop Whitgist concerns matters of the like
nature, and are of as little moment, as has been proved at large above, lib. 2.
Nevertheless it is good reason that whosoever shall note any thing for an
innovation, and attri^ute is peculiarly unto a Pope, should be urged to assign
what Pope it was. Which is a case different from that whereabout we now contend.
impertinently. We contrarily oppose two things, the fist is (...), to wit;

That it is not necessary, for the confutation of errors, to demonstrate the
time, or other such circumstances of the beginning of them, as may be
illustrated by similitudes.
SECT. 2.
2 The similitude taken from the hair of man's head, which by little and little
waxes white, is by the Apologists much distasted, albeit etiam capillus habet
suam vmbram; that is, his simile did shadow forth (...), that is the matter
principally intended: for the hair, of black waxes white, and yet is not
discernable in the moments of change. But no simile will content them, except
it may gallop on four feet: when as indeed Logic (although it be the art of
arts) cannot give any similitude, which shall not halt of one leg.

3 That which does most nearely sample this point, may be first the Matthew. 13.
24.
tares, which are said to have been sown whilst the householders were asleep,
and did not appear until they were sprung up in the blade. For if likewise
Christians be asked concerning the first seeding of some errors, they may
answer, that they know not precisely the time; only this they know, that the
husbandmen not regarding the seed (because it seemed little and of no danger)
neglected it as men asleep, neither could it be discerned until it did
appear in a blade. Secondly the Apostle likewise has resembled corrupt and
erroneous speeches unto a 2. Tim. 2. 17.
creeping-canker, which is a disease in man's body, gathering upon a man by
little and little from joint to joint, until it have corrupted the vital
parts. These are but lights of comparisons, to show the beginning and progress
of an alteration. Now shall we animate this Idaea by

Pregnant examples of changes in doctrines, the certain originals whereof
cannot be directly showed.
SECT. 3.
4 Lest that our Adversaries may complain, that we give them similitudes
without examples as it were souls without bodies, we exhibit unto them
examples from Scriptures, from Fathers, and from their own Church.

5 When the Pharisees tempted Christ in the question of divorce, asking, Matthew.
19. 3. The questions were two: 1. whether it is lawful? the second to confirm
it lawful: else Why did Moses suffer it? Christ answers both: Moses suffered
it for the hardness of your hearts: but to the other, It was not so, that is,
not thought (...) f^ll from the beginning.
Whether is it lawful for a man to put away his wife upon every occasion? Our
Savior answered, saying, (verse. 8.) From the beginning it was not so:
reproving the common error of the jews by testimony of antiquity, from the
word of God, Genesis 2. 24. For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
and cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

6 Here our Romanists would have taught the Pharisees to reply upon Christ,
thus: If you convince us of error, you must show us, when this arose in the
Church of God, who first taught it, and what person resisted it; or else this
contrary custom must be maintained as divine, and from the beginning. But the
wisdom of Christ seems to condemn this reason of folly, when passing over
the original of this custom (although happily issuing from time before a
thousand generations of mankind) he is contented with the revealed will of God
in the beginning of truth, In the beginning it was not so: plainly teaching us,
that we are not bound, for the confutation of error, to a positive
demonstration of the beginning thereof, but that it is sufficient to deliver a
negative, showing a time when it was not. We are not destitute of examples in
this kind taken from former Churches, such as is the Sea above lib. 2. cap. 13.
Sect 3. held then as necessary unto salvation in Europe, Asia, and Africa: as
appears by S. Cypria^, Parents forte fugientes, etc. Sermon. 5. de Lapsis: and
Hieron. contra ^uciferi. August. de d^gm. Eccles. 52. and ep. 107. and lib. 5.

confessed error of the administration of the Eucharist unto infants in the
days of S. Augustine, which continued in the Church for 600 years, the first
Author, or visible resister whereof, our Adversaries cannot name in continuance
of so many hundred years.

7 The like might be said of the error of the Sea above.
Millenarij, which our Adversaries have acknowledged to have been both ancient
and general, and defended by primitive Fathers, and that without either
notorious beginning, or public resistance. Not to stand upon many heresies,
which are as vndemonstrable in respect of time, as they are unjustifiable in
respect of truth.

8 But our Readers appetite (we guess) desires to have some taste of a like
manner of change in the Roman Church. The administration of the communion in
both kinds, viz. bread and wine, is according unto the institution of Christ,
and was used (as their Lyra says) Fit hic (1. Cor. 11.) mentio de d^plici
specie: nam in Primitiua Ecclesia sic dabatur fidelibus. Lyranus in 1. Cor. 11.
in the primitive Church, successively continuing in the universal Church of
Christ (as their Cassander testifies, from the testimonies, as he says, Satis

Episcoporum mandato, quam popul^ vsu and facto (conniuentibus tamen
praesulibus) irrepsisse: populus enim ob varia incommoda paulatim a calice
abstin^bant. Episcopi propter varia effusionis sanguinis, aliaque pericula,
tacendo, hanc abstinentiam comprobabant, quae abstinentia a calice cum tempore
Constantiensis Conc. fere per Europam vniuersalis esset, non erat damnanda, sed
contra haereticos insu^gentes defendenda. Coster Ies. Enchirid. Tract. De
commun. sub vtraque specie. page 359.
It is diligently to be observed (says their Jesuit Costerus) that the using
of but one kind (to wit the bread only) in the Eucharist, was taken up not by
commandment of the Bishops, but it crept in (the Bishops winking thereat) by
the practice of the people, who by little and little abstained from the use of
the Cup: which abstinence became almost universal in all Europe at the
Council of Constance: In quo (Concilio) pro lege ab omnibus habendam esse
consu^tudinem, dec^etum erat. Greg. de ^alent. Ies. de legit. vsu Sacram. c.
10.. Coepit a^tem.
in the which Council it was decreed to be continued.

9 In this one sacrilegious deprauation may be exemplified the nature of errors
offspring. First they yield unto us that the communion of both bread and wine
is by antiquity from Christ his institution. Secondly by continuance, it
endured the space of a thousand years. Thirdly, by consent universal in all
Churches Christian, yet in the Roman profession has been altered by a
contrary and general practice of the people, they know not either when,
where, or by whom. Fourthly, they discern it to have crept in (not unlike a
cold taken at the feet) by the peoples devotion, and not by violence. Fifthly,
the opportunity, whilst as Pastors winked at it, and therefore it found no
public resistance, but prevailed by a decretiue accordance. Which one example
we have propounded as sufficient for a taste and trial of that our Adversaries
incomparable boldness in this their challenge, exacting of us the particular
instances of time, place, and persons, both as authors and resisters unto every
notorious change: which challenge will hereafter be confuted by many examples
of confessed novelties throughout the most points of doctrines, which are now
controuerted between the Protestants and Romanists. But first let us see

The state of the question, concerning Antiquity.
SECT. 4.
10 Our Savior Christ by his Matthew. 1^.
parable of the diverse seeds, first wheat in the day, and then tares in the
night, does teach us, that truth may challenge prioritie of error,
Princip^litatem veritati, pos^^ ^^tatem mendacitati deputandam, -- primo bonum
semen seminatum (Matthew. 13.) postea a Diabolo lolium. Tert. praescript.
yielding principality unto truth, says Tertullian, and posterity unto
lying. And so it must needs be, because as there must be first iron, before
there can be rust which cankereth the iron; so must there be a virgin truth,
before error, which is nothing else but an adulteration thereof. So that primum
and verum, that is, primarie antiquity and truth are both inseparable twins,
begot and bred in the same instant. Yet as the first seduction of mankind did
shortly follow the integrity of his first creation, so sometime the difference
between error and truth, in respect of time, has been no more then as wheat
in the day, and tares in the same night: which made S. Cyprian say, that there
is vetustas erroris, and Tertullian notes some heresies to have been Tertul.
praescript.
coaetaneas Apostolorum, that is, broached in the Apostles times: yet still so,
that truth might always challenge the birthright.

11 Our Savior Christ by reforming the corrupt doctrine of divorce, (which was
ancienter then Moses) by a more ancient constitution, even of that which was
Matthew. 19.
ab initio, that is, from the beginning, did teach us wisely to distinguish of
Antiquity, that one is primitive and hereditary, the other adoptiue, of an
after invention. Concerning these two, the ancient (and herein generally
approved) Fathers have given us their prescriptions.

12 For they consider the Si haec ita sunt, constat proinde omnem doctrinam,
quae cum illis Ecclesijs Apostolicis matricibus and originalibus fidei
conspiret, veritati deputanda^: and sine dubio tenentes quod Ecclesiae ab
Apostolis, Apostoli a Christo, Christus a Deo suscepit, reliquam vero omnem
doctrinam de mendacio praeiudicandam, quae sapiat contra veritatem Ecclesiarum,
and Apostolorum, and Christi, and Dei. Tertullian de praescript. paulo ante
medium.
primitive Antiquity as it proceeded ab Apostolis, that is, from the holy
Apostles, and was preserved a viris Apostolicis, that is, by the next
successors of the Apostles: and they hold all other doctrines to be prejudicial
unto the faith. But what if after the Apostles any one Pastor in the Church
shall assume to himself a power to prescribe any new doctrine unto the Church?
Such an one (which choaketh the Romish presumption concerning the infallibility
of judgment in one Pope over the whole Church,) is to be esteemed, by the
sentence of Lirinensis, for Et ne quis forsitan praetermissis caeteris, se
solum audiri, sibi soli credi arrogaret, paulo post ait, (1. Cor. 14.) An a
vobis, inquit, verbum Dei processit? aut in vos solos deuenit? Et ne hoc quasi
perfunctorie acciperetur, Adiecit; siquis, inquit, videtur Propheta esse aut
spiritualis, id est, spiritualium rerum Magister, summo studio aequalitatis and
vnitatis cultor existat, vt scil. neque opiniones suas caeteris praeferat, and
ab vniuersorum sensibus non recedat. Vincentius Lirinens. contra haeres. cap.
40.
an arrogant Noueller. Yea but tell us what is novelty? When the Apostle
exhorted his Timothy to 1. Tim 6. 20.
keep that which was committed unto him, and to take heed of profane
novelties, he did, in effect, instruct him to Depositum, i^quit, custodi. Quid
est depositum? id est, quod tibi creditum est, non quod a te inuentum; quod
accepisti, non quod excogitasti; rem ad te perductam non a te prolatam; in qua
non author debes esse, sed custos; non institutor, sed sectator; non ducens,
sed sequens. Depositum, inquit, custodi. Lirinensis ibid. cap. 27.
preserve the doctrine received, not to suggest any doctrines newly conceived,
as says Lirinensis: who accounts it (according unto Salmeron his
description) a whorish t^icke to call any out of the ancient and beaten way,
and to say, Deuita prophanas vocum nouitates.] -- Si vitanda est nouitas,
tenenda est antiquitas. And a little after: Nonne haec verba sunt illius
meretricis, quae apud Salomonis Prouerbia vocat ad se praetercuntes viam; qui
est (inquit, Prou. 9.) vestrum insipientiss. diuertat ad me. Idem ibid. cap. 26.
Come unto me. But if any new doctrine shall seem to infect the whole Church,
what then shall be our direction? In such a case we are not taught to respect
the present universality, but to Quid si nouella aliqua contagio non iam
portiunculam tantum, sed totam pariter Ecclesiam commaculare conetur? tunc
prouidebit, vt antiquitati adhaereat, quae prorsus iam non potest ab vlla
nouitatis sraude seduci. Ibid. cap. 4.
adhere unto the former Apostolical antiquity.

13 Yet may it further be demanded, if some particular Church cannot
peradventure derive the doctrine which it defends, from the lineall descent
of Pastors, and shall notwithstanding profess altogether the Apostles
doctrine, whether this shall be called a new Church? No, but every such Church
Ad hanc formam prouocabuntur ab illis Ecclesijs, quae licet nullum ex Apostolis
vel Apostolicis authorem suum proferant, vt multo posteriores, quae denique
quotidie instituuntur; tamen in eadem fide conspirantes, non minus Apostolicae
deputantur, pro consanguinitate doctrinae. Tert praescript.
is to be called primitive and Apostolical even (says Tertullian) for the
consanguinitie-sake which it has with the doctrine of the Necesse est itaque
tot ac tantae Ecclesiae, vnam esse illam ab Apostolicis primam, ex qua omnes.
Sic omnes primae, and omnes Apostolicae, dum vnam omnes probant vnitatem.
Tertul. praescript.
Apostles. Whereupon it follows that those Churches must be esteemed Vnde
autem extranei and inimici Apostolis haeretici, nisi ex diuersitate doctrinae,

Idem ibid.
strangers from the true faith, which teach His definitionibus prouocatae a

imo defenditur, hoc erit iudicium proprietatis: quam enim damnant, quasi
extraneam, quamque non damnauerunt, suam ostendunt, ideoque and defendunt.
Ibidem.
contrary unto the Apostles traditions.

14 Notwithstanding, the Protestants in the disquisition of truth, do not
absolutely bound the name of antiquity within the compass of the first
Centurie of years, but are content to allow it a longer extent, and therefore
in all doctrines which are truly called Catholic (that is, 1. in respect of
their original, Apostolical, 2. for their exte^t universally received in all
the first Churches, and 3. in their use necessary, either in faith or in
manners,) they refuse not to be tried by the testimonies of ancient Fathers in
the first Dicunt (Protestants) post quingentos annos coepisse valde

five hundred years after Christ. But of the times following we are to
understand, that the doctrines which cannot fetch their pedigree further then
from the^, although they may seem, in respect of our last times, ancient and
gray headed, yet are they but green and new in respect of the first five
hundred years. In which consideration the Churches of Protestants are to be
called primitive and Apostolical, only because of consanguinitie with the
Apostolical doctrine, which by the blessing of God they do happily enjoy and
profess. For proof whereof we now proceed unto a discovery of

CHAP. XVII.
The manifold, notorious, and confessed Innouations of the Romish Church in
doctrines and customs: the first (which is the worst) is a new Doctrine,
transgressing the only law of discerning the true antiquity of doctrines.
SECT. 1.
IN the maine question of discerning the true books of holy writ, the
Protestants do appeal from the Romish Council. Trid. Sess. 4.
Anathema unto the judgment of the primitive Church, attributing unto it the
right and authority of assigning and determining what is the perfect Canon of
Scriptures. But this doctrine is impugned by their D. Stapleton, saying, that
Quod ad iudicium, determinationem, and approbationem Scripturarum canonicarum
attinet, eius authoritatem penes praesentem Ecclesiam esse, non secus quam
penes Apostolos fuit. Stapleton. doctrine. princip. lib. 9. cap. 12.
there is no less authority in the present Church (meaning, of Rome) for
determining and approving the true books of the Bible, then there was in the
Apostles themselves.

2 This position once granted, a gap is presently opened for a legion of
profane novelties to invade and surprise the Church of God. For if that in this
and the like determinations of any truth, it shall be sufficient to say, This is
defined by the now Church, which is of equal authority with the primitive
Church: when will it be but a matter preposterous, and indeed ridiculous for
Protestants (according to the former prescriptions set down by Tertullian and
Vincentius Lirinensis) to appeal unto the judgment of Antiquity, and to
plead for any truth from the evidence of the primitive Church?

3 But we shall let our Reader perceive the dissimulated vant of antiquity
unmasked, by discovering of the novelty and profaneness of this one new
position, whereby the law of antiquity is so notably obscured and buried. For
we are not destitute of the testimonies of more ancient Doctors, even in the
Romish School, such as were Ecclesia primiti^a propter coll^gium Apestolorum
ad tradendam sidei doctrinam matoris erat grati^, matoris authoritatis, quam
Ecclesia quae nunc est. Driedo de varijs dogma^. lib. 4 cap. 4.
Driedo, Apostolorum Ecclesia, and haec nostra vna and eadem indiuidua Ecclesia

Lugduni 1563. Unto these testimonies, showing us that the Church has not now
power to approve any Scriptures for Canonical, which were not so acknowledged
in the Apostles times, Doctor Stapleton does oppose his answer: Catholicorum
quorundam sententijs secus opinantium, corumque argumentis enumeratis
respondetur. Doctr. princip. lib. 9. c. 13. and. 14.
Durandus (whom M. Stapleton labors to confute,) who all held, that although
the primitive and succeeding Church is all one, even as one individual man,
whether old or young, is the same man: yet was the primitive of more authority
for delivering unto us the doctrine of faith. Which consideration (say they)
moved S. Augustine to, say, that I had not believed the Scriptures, except the
Church of God had moved me; understanding by Church that ancient Catholic
Church, which first preached the Gospel. Which thing their learned Chancellor
Mayor erat primitiuae Ecclesiae authoritas, quoad praedicta, quam nunc est: non

hinc aperitur modus intelligendi illud Augustini, Euangelio non crederem, nisi

congregatione fidelium, qui Christum viderunt, and audiuerunt, and sui testes
extiterunt. Gerson. de vita spirit. animae, lect. 2. Coral. 7.
Gerson does also expressly observe, and must be unto us a pole-starre for our
direction in this turbulent contention about Antiquity.

CHAP. XVIII.
A second confessed Romish Innovation is in assuming of a new Canon of
Scripture of the old Testament, thereby profaning the chief principles of
Christian says.
SECT. 1.
WE further enter upon their greatest fort of pretended antiquity, and for our
more expedient demolishing of it, we shall follow the heads of controue^sies,
according to the method which Cardinal Bellarmine has used: and first begin
with that point of doctrine which ought to be the o and a, that is, the
beginning and ending of all Christian resolution, even the Canon of holy
Scriptures; for of the new Testament, we (whom he terms Bellar. lib. 1. de
verbo Dei, ca. 17 and 18, and 19. where he treats of the questioned books of
the new Testament, viz. Epist. ad Hebraeos, Epist. ^acobi, Iud^^, secunda

six books which Protestants call Apocrypha, (which have been canonized by
the Council of Trent for authentical, under the denuntiation of Anathema upon
every one who shall dare to judge them not Canonical) that the ancient Jews
did not acknowledge them for the Oracles of sacred writ. And we are now further
to avouch the truth of our profession from just antiquity: as first, from the

the Proverbs of Solomon, follows Sapientia, yet is it not to be understood as
a distinct book from the Proverbs: for first it used not to be re^^oned in
that order next unto the Proverbs: secondly the author of it was not Solomon,
but (as their Galatinus confesses) Philo; for he says lib. 1. cap. 4. de
arcan. verit. Cath. Philo edidit diuinum illud volumen, quod Sapientiam Solomon

turned into the article prep^siti^e ^^ ((...)) in the former cited place of
Eusebiu: fourthly, Bellarmine says that Melito did plainly follow the Hebrew
catalogue, (see beneath lit. k.) and then could he not possibly judge Sapientia
to be Canonical. Lastly, it may be that this moved their Canu^, in answer unto

Romanists with great confidence do take their first hold and strength, for the
antiquity of their Canon of the old Testament: but may be satisfied either by
the doubtfulnesse of the Canon it self, which (as may be collected from the
testimony of Cardinal Rursum vero de recensitis sub eodem Concilio (viz.

exposition of their Cardinal Caietane, who instructs his Reader to
distinguish of the word Canonical, viz. as serving either for a Ne turberes,
Nouitie, siquando inuenies hos libros inter Canonicos supputari, vel in sacris
Conc. vel in Doctoribus: non enim Canonici sunt, id est, Regulares, ad firmanda

Com. veteris Testamenti. Idem quod Gratianus did. 16. ca. 1. Gloss.
rule of faith, or of manners. Of the first kind are such Scriptures, which
are properly called Canonical, and are the undoubted Oracles of God: the
second degree does comprise them, which are not of sufficient authority for
the establis^ing of any point of faith, but yet help for edification of man's
life in godliness: of which kind only he shows these six books to be,
which we more properly have called Apocrypha.

5 And this is hereby made more then probable, because, if they had been
defined to be properly Canonical in that their Council of Carthage, wherein
S. Augustine was present, why would S. See above.
Augustine himself distinguish the books of Macchabees from the diuinelie
Canonical? Or how could it be lawful for S. Gregory Pope of Rome, two hundred
years after this Council of Carthage (as our Adversaries confess,) not only

deny them to be Canonical? We are yet within the compass of 600 years
after Christ.

Council of Trent, which was about the year 1534. and before that time we have

Bellarmine) many, as namely, Lyranus Albule^sis, Caictanus, Dionys.
Carthusianus, Hugo, who lived before the Council of Trent, and were esteemed
the most eminent Doctors of that Church in their times: who all have excluded
some of these foresaid books, and some have branded them all with the note of
Apocrypha: according rather (as Protestants teach) unto the ancient Church of
the Jews, and the primitive profession of the Churches Christian, then unto
the novel conceits of aftertimes.

7 What can our Adversaries answer unto this opposition of their own Doctors?
M^lchior Canus says, that he will See above at the letters, t.
not condemn them of rashness, but of ignorance. Wherein Canus himself may
seem to incur the just reprehension not of ignorance, but of rashness: for
who can be induced to think that the principal Doctors of the Romish Church
could be ignorant of the judgment thereof (especially concerning the Canon of
holy Scriptures, which are the chief principles and foundation of Catholic
faith) if in their time this now Romish doctrine had bin the^ held for a
Catholic doctrine? Their Jesuit Pererius is more remiss, holding the^ to be
possibly excusable, See above lit. u.
because (says he) this matter was not thoroughly discussed and decided until
the Council of Trent: before which time the forenamed Doctors (as Cardinal
Bellarmine says) followed the judgment of S. Hierome therein, according unto
the Hebrew Canon of the Bible.

8 So that the now Romish Church, imposing an Anathema upon every one, who
shall not acknowledge the six Apocryphal books for Canonical, does display
her self to be degenerated from her own, and from the Catholic truth; as by
the catalogues of Scriptures recorded in the Apostolical mother Churches for
400 years has appeared, and also for the space of many hundred years more, as
by the confessed examples of S. Gregory, and other their choice and approved
Doctors, has been sensibly confirmed. Whereby the greenness of this first and
great Innovation does bewray itself.

A confessed Romish change of their vulgar Translation of Scripture.
SECT. 2.
9 What is more common in our Adversaries then to grace their vulgar Latin
translation with the name of no vulgar Author, whilst that they ordinarily
call it S. Hieromes Bible, and that (as Vulgatam versionem Hieronymi esse,
contendit Eugubinus, and alij nonnul^i: and are therefore reproved by Bellar.

some of their Doctors are affirmed to say) in every part? but so unlearnedly,

Tertia prop.
Cardinal Bellarmine will not think S. Hierome to have been the author of the
translation either of the Psalms, or of the Macchabees, and such other books,
which he judged to be Apochrypha. Albeit he does entitle S. Hierome the
translator of Reliqua omnia ex Hieronymi versione ex Hebraeo habemus: nam vetus
Testam ex Hebraeo in Latinum transtulit, and nonum ex veteri Latina emendauit.

siquidem illa prisca aetas ante annos 1500. hac versione vsa, haud ita potuit a
Romanae linguae puritate tantillum degenerate. Lindanus lib. 3. de opt. genere
interp. c. 6.
We have no certain knowledge who was the translator of our vulgar Latin
either in the Psalms, or in the new Testament: but I see many reasons (says
he) to make me suspect, that some smatterer in the Greek tongue was the author
hereof; for if it had been so ancient, then (an argument which They confess it
is full of grammatical faults. Test Azor. Ies. Instit. moral. part 1. lib. 8
cap. 3.
will as sufficiently prove that no part of that translation is so very ancient,
as is pretended) it could not have so much degenerated from the purity of the
Latin tongue. Which reason, with some others, (as namely, because S. Hierome
himself does reprove the author of the same translation, and condemns him of
ignorance) made their Stapulensis to judge every one Omnes, inquies tenent
hanc Editionem esse opus Hieronymi; imo omnes, qui incolumi pollent iudicio
negant: nam Hieron. eam redarguit, and (...), and authorem eius saepe vellicat,
and inscitiae accusat; ita opus nominat, vt alienum; ita interpretem ^^us
redarguit, vt alium, and suggillat: est igitur caput pertinax, quisquis aliter
statuerit. Stapulens. praes. ante Coman Episi. Pauli, in Apolog.
defective in judgment, and obstinately erroneous, who shall contend to father
that translation upon S. Hierome.

10 It will delight our Reader, to understand how cunningly their Cardinal
Bellarmine seeks to expedite and free himself out of these straits: he
faineth that S. Hierome made a translation, which afterward he corrected: and
when it is demanded, Why then does the Church of Rome rather embrace the former
translation of Hierome, then his correction? he answers, that Ob. Multa
inueniuntur in nostra Editione vulgata, quae B. Hieronym. in quaest. and lib.
de opt. genesis interp. and alibi, docet aliter fuisse vertenda: igitur fieri non
potest vt Editio nostra sit ipsa Translatio, quam Hieron. fecerat ex Hebraeo.
Respondeo, -- quarta causa est, quia etsi B Hieron. interdum senserit quaedam
mutanda in sua versione, and ea notauerit in suis co^mentarijs: tamen Ecclesia
postea magis iudicauit veram primam versionem, and eam retinere maluit in
Editione vulgata. Bellar. lib. 2. de verbo Det, cap. 9. Tertium argum. and.
Quarta causa.
the Church thought the first translation to be the better. Which was in
effect, the answer of their Dorpius, whom Sir Thomas Moore therefore confuted,
saying, Hieronyn. ianam Translationem primam corrigentem non admittimus, M.
Dorpius epist. apud Thomam Morum. Quod Hieronyn. us iudicauit potissimum, ab eo
tu potissimum deterres. Thom. Morus epist. ad eundem, ibid.
Thou take that for the worse, which S. Hierome judged to be the better. And
so must any judge, who will not impute unto S. Hierome dotage in his
corrections, which (as an Oedipus Colonaeus) are sufficient arguments in
themselves by their excellent learning to free him from that imputation. We
choofe rather to believe their more sincere Authors, See above lit. e, f.
who have denied it to be Hieroms translation, but rather of some silly
Graectan, or, of they know not whom. Which must enforce the Apologists, who
challenge of us an express mention of the first persons, time, and place of
Innouations, to assign when, where, and by whom their common translation was
first framed and altered; or else confess, that such like circumstantiall
changes of former times may not now be exacted.

The Innovation by the Council of Trent, in prescribing the vulgar Latin to
be Authentical.
SECT. 3.
11 As that figure is more properly called ancient, which receives the
impression immediately from life, then that which is drawn but by imitation of
a former example; so a translation of Scripture, which is directly taken (this
is the profession of Protestants) from the Hebrew or Greek originals, is to be
judged truly ancient, rather then that which is but translated out of a Latin
translation, such as are all their new Bibles (as for example the Rhemish)
which are permitted by the Church, and do not immediately follow the Greek
edition, (for of the Hebrew we See above lib. 3 cap. 1.. 2. and cap. 16.. 3.
and in this Chap. Sect. 1. etc.
have already disputed) but that which the Romanists call See above Sect. 2.
untruly Hieroms translation; and is fraught with many old corruptions.

12 Our Adversaries the Rhemists are privileged to justify their act, by
telling us, that the vulgar translation (which they follow in their English
Testament) Rhemists in their Praeface unto their Translation of the new
Testament.. It is.
is not only better then all other Latin, but even then the Greek text it
self, in those places where they disagree: the proof hereof (say they) is
evident, because most of the ancient heretics were Graecians; and therefore
the Scriptures were corrupted by them, as ancient Fathers often complain. And
so they would also avouch of their translations of the old Testament (if they
had any) in respect of the Hebrew text.

13 But we have a principal witness at hand out of their own School, who
will give them to understand, that the exception now used, is an Ad illud vero
quod Anabapt^stae de corruptione tam Graecorum quam ^atmorum codicum obijciu^t,
dicimus non licere ex particulari aliquorum cod* deprauatione in^erre
vniuersalem, ac generalem codicum omnium corruptionem. Senensis Bibl. lib. 7.
page 579.. Ad illud. -- Quoniam (vt Augustinus inquit) licet omnes Patres in

iam toto terra^um ^rb^ Christiano^um manibus tererentur; quia mox vt id agere
coepissent re^la^antibus pass^m omnibus Christianis, tanquam f^liarij ^uis^ent

Anabaptisticall siction, confuted by S. Augustine, showing that it was
impossible for heretics to corrupt all the Greek copies, although they had
conspired to work such a mischief because there were always godly Christians
ready to preserve the Scriptures from such deprauation. Then preventing an
objection, which is commonly made from the testimonies of some Fathers, in
their censures of the Greek copies, he concludes from the express sentence
of S. Hierome, thus: Wheresoever (says Hierome) there is any variety in the
Latin translations of the new Testament, we must consult with the Greek text,
wherein the Scripture was first written. And lest any might except (as the
Rhemists have done) that the Greek text, which is now in use, has been, since
those ancient times of Hierome, greatly corrupted, and infected with heretical
additions, or subtractions, the same their learned Senensis further auerieth,
that Dicimus cum Graecum codicem, qui nunc ^u Ecclesia legitur, eundem illum
esse, quo Ecclesia Gra ca temporibus Hieronymi, and long antea ^ que ad
tempo^a Apostolorum vsa est, veru^. syn^eru^, fidelem, and nullo falsitatis
vitio contammatum, sicut continuata omnium Grac^rum Patium lectio lucidissime
ostendit vno semper atque eodem Scripturae tenore legentibus Dionysio, susti^o,

Chrylostomo, Theo. hylacto, atque alt^s, ante tempora and post tempora
Hieronymi, Patribus. Seuensis Bibl. lib. 7. page 580.
the Greek text which is now read in the Scripture, is the same which was used
in the days of S. Hierome, and long before him in the Apostles times; and is
free from heretical corruptions, as by the continual writings (says he) of
the Greek Fathers (as namely, Dionysius, Justinius, Irenaeus, Melito, Origin,
Africanus, Apollinarius, Athanasius, Eusebius, Basil, Chrysostom, Theophylact,
and others) does most plainly appear. Neither can our As is proved in the
^at^n Apologi^, part. 2 lib. 1 cap. 6. etc. in the answering their objections
out of the Fathers, and Beza, and other instances.
Adversaries bring any instance of moment unto the contrary. Hitherto we have
a general notion of this point.

14 If we may have leave to descend unto particulars, in examination of the
Romish Latin translation, (whereof the Rhemists have avouched saying, that the
Greek text it self is to be corrected by the vulgar Latin in those places
where they disagree: we shall readily prove, not by Protestants, but by
Romanists, not of common, but of singular note, that their vulgar Latin (not
that which was commanded by the Council of Trent to be purged, but that which
since has been lately reuiewed, corrected, and published for the perfect
Latin copy, by Pope Biblia sacra vulgatae Editionis, Sixti Quinti Pontificis
Maximi iussu recognita, and Clementis 8. authoritate edita. Coloniae, Anno 1609.
Clement the eight) stands yet infected not only with light and triuiall,
but even with gross and unpardonable corruptions, which may and ought to be
corrected, not by any Latin, but by the Hebrew and Greek text now allowed and
used by Protestants.

15 Among less notorious we may reckon, 3. Kings. 16. where these words [ 3.
Reg. 16. [Hoc est, Iehu, filium Canani, Prophetam.] Hebra^ca lectio non liabet,
uni fallor, sed est annotatiuncula quaeda^ margini primum adiccta ab incerto

That is Iehu the son of Cananie a Prophet,] are confessed to have lept out
of the margent into the text. In Matthew. 6. 5. there is Matthew 6. 5. [Qui amant.]

which is to be corrected (says the Jesuit Maldonate) by the Grecke text. In
Luc. 22. 20. there is Luc. 22. 20. [Qui fundetur.] Illa verba legenda sunt in
praesenti tempore iuxta omnes Euangelistas in Graeco textu [Funditur.]
Stapleton. prompt. fer. 3. liebd. Sanct. page 273.
the future tense for the present tense, contrary (says Doctor Stapleton)
unto all the Evangelists in the Grecke text. In Heb. 4. 2. there is Heb. 4. 2.
[In ijs quae (Grace, Qui) audiuetunt.] Sine dubio legendum est in nostra
translatione [Qui;] neque enim aliter Graeca intelligi polsunt. Riber. Ies. in
eum locu^, p. 184.
which for who, wherein the reading (says the Jesuit Ribera) ought to be
according to the Greek. In Iac. 5. 16 there is the word Iae 5. 16. Confitemini
Frgo (in Graec^ deest vox Ergo) alterutrum* etc. Melius sine tali aduerbio
legeretur hic locus, non enim recte infertur ex supetius dictis, vbi nullam de
confessione mentionem fecerat Apostolus. Salmeron Ies. in eum locu^, disp. 6..
Octa^o etc.
therefore (which is not in the Greek,) which without doubt (says the Jesuit
Salmeron) were better left out. In Apocal. 14. 3. there is say, for, learn;
and Apoc. 14. 3. [Nemo potest dicere (Graece, discere) canticu^.] Ideo non in
Graecis hoc locu error est, sed in I atinis. Ribera Ies. in eum locum. page 361.
the error (says their Jesuit Ribera) is not in the Greek, but in the
Latin. Should not such confessed escapes have bin corrected in that last
translation, which they have promulged for the most absolute? or being there
found, shall we not hold the^ for novelties?

16 Those corruptions which we either judge to have been causes, or at least,
occasions of erring, are found in these examples: Genesis 3. 15. For the Hebrew [
Genesis 3. 15. Ipsum conteret caput Serpentis.]
he shall bruise the head of the Serpent,] their Latin turns us [shee;]
although their own In omnibus pene vulgatis Latinis codicibus legitur [Ipsa]
Hieron. ait, melius habet in Hebraeo [Ipse.] Franciscus Luca notat, in eum
locum.
Luca can tell us, that S. Hierome thought the Hebrew to be better: and their
Jesuit Pererius cannot deny, but that by the text Cuius inulietis (Mariae)
semen Christus fuit, and recte, solus enim hominum ex foemina sine virth semine
generatus est: and hic contriuit c^put Serpentis, nam Hebraice nomen, Ipse, non
ad mulierem, sed ad semen re^ertur: caput autem Diaboli fuit n^ortis and
peccati potestas, quam ille in omnes habebat, and hanc ille destruxit. Pererius

only Christ, and not the woman is signified; because Christ alone does
destroy the power of death and sin, which is the head of the hellish Serpent.
In Genesis 14. 18. they would not have retained the particle, enim, that is, for,
except that they had intended by the force thereof (as their Cardinal Genesis 14.
18. Melchizedech protulit panem and vinum, erat [Enim] Sacerdos altissimi] Quae
ratio ab ipso Spiritu sancto reddita -- cogit vt intellgamus panem and vinum
prolata fuisse ad sacrificium. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 6.. Sequitur.
Bellarmine notes) to prove the sacrifice of their Mass: which observation
their Cardinal Quod in vulgata subditur particula [Enim] vt causa oblationis,
in Hebraeo non habetur, nil enim hic de Sacrificio aut oblatione. Caietanus,
and alij. See above lib. 2. cap. 7. Greece (...), Chald ea and erat, Hieron. ad
Euag. Erat autem: Arias Montanus, Ipse erat. Wherein we do not blame our
Adversaries so much for collecting a Sacrifice in the Eucharist it self, as
for enforcing that the Eucharist is a sacrifice propitious: and that they take
their Ergo, from this Enim, which is a non ens.
Caietane shows, from the Hebrew text, to be superfluous.

17 In Exodus 34. 29. 30. we read according to the Hebrew, that [ Exodus, 34 29.
Videbant filij Aaron faciem Mosis radiantem. Heb. Videntes faciem Mosis
cornutam] vulg.
they saw the face of Moses shining:] in their vulgar Latin it is said [they
saw his face horned:] which vulgar translation their Senensis wishes to be
corrected by the Hebrew, Ex Hebraea potest emendari praua vulgi consuetudo, qui
duobus cornibus pingunt Mosen: -- Rident igitur nos and execrantur Iudaei,
quoties Mosen in templis nostris cornuta facie depictum aspiciunt, quasi nos
eum Diabolum quendam, vt illi stulte interpretantur, esse putemus. Senensis
Bibl. lib. 5. annot. 116. page 371.
because the Jews (says he) do scoff and hate us Christians, when soever
they happen to see the picture of Moses painted with horns, as though (so they
foolishly imagine) we thought him to have been a Devil.

18 In the Psalm. 2. 12. the Hebrew has, [kisse the son, lest he be angrte,]
and the vulgar Latin otherwise, Apprehend you discipline: herein Saepecodices
Hebraei magis Iudaeos vexant quam Graeci aut Latini, vt in Psalm. 2. vulg.
[Apprehendite disciplinam] ex quo contra Iudaeos nihil aperte deduci potest. At
Heb. [Osculamini filium ne pereatis.] qui locus est inuictissimus aduersus
Iudaeos Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 2.. Argumentum quartum.
the Hebrew (as Cardinal Bellarmine confesses) does more perplexe the Jews,
and inuincibly prove Christ the Messiah to be God. In the Psalm. 18. 6. In sole
posuit Tabernaculum suum. Vulg.
Psalm. 18. 6. their vulgar says, [he (that is, God) put a tabernacle in the
Sun.] Manichaei ex imperiti^ linguae, cum non intelligerent literalem sensum
huius dicti, conuetterunt le ad praesidia allegorieae expositionis, dicentes,
Christum post re^uriectionem suam ca^ne ad Patrem ascendisse, relicto corpore
suo inter ambitum globi solaris, vt a nobis caro eius in sole, tanquam in
tabernaculo Dominici corporis adorarctur: cum tamen genuinus ac proprius sentus
sit, Deum posuisse soli tabernaculum in coelo. Sixtus Senensis Bibl. lib. 3.
page 141.
Whence the Manichees did allegorically collect (says their Senensis) that
Christ in his ascension into heaven, did leave his body in the globe of the
Sun: wherein they erred through ignorance of the Hebrew text, which says,
God put in heaven a tabernacle for the Sun.

19 In Luc. 2. 14. out of the Latin they translate [ Luc. 2. 14. Pax hominibus
bonae voluntatis.
Peace unto men of good will:] we translate otherwise from the Greek; [
Graece, [Hominibus bona voluntas.] Vulg. Bonae voluntatis.
and unto men good will.] Hereof we have their own Jesuit Maldonate
confessing, that Omnes nunc Graeci codices hab^nt (...), bona voluntas, atque
ita omnes non antiquissimi Graecorum Interpretes legunt. And a little after:
Putant enim illi (^peaking of others) boua voluntatis homines appellari, qui
bonam habeant voluntatem, and ad recipiendam diuinam misericordiam, and pacem
illam, quae annunciabatur, propensam. -- Iam docuimus (...), non hominum, sed
Dei erga homines bonam voluntatem significare. Maldon. Ies com. in Luc. cap. 2.
verse. 14.
all the Greek copies now extant have it, good will (viz. of God) unto men: and
Cardinal Bellarmine will have us to hold this as the Ex Graeco colligitur
melius. -- Nam (...), vt plurimum, non est bona voluntas hominis, sed bona
voluntas Dei erga homines. Bellarm. lib. 2 de verbo Dei, cap. 11.. Sic etiam.
better, by the light of the Greek text.

20 In Ioh. 4. 10. the Greek says, [ I^h. 4. 10. Tu forsitan petijsses ab
eo.] Graec^^r, id est, Tu vtique petijsles ab eo. -- At Interpres noster in vno
loco v^rtit, and per mod^m dubitantis, forsitan, vt liberum arb^trium hominis
significaret, quod ita petit, vt possit non pe^ere (...). Ies. com. in I^h 4.
page 342.
thou verily would have asked him:] but of the Latin their Jesuit Tolet
affirms, saying, Our Interpreter does translate it [thou perhaps woul^st have
asked,] that thereby he might signify man's freewill, as having power to ask,
or not to ask. Which is the same change of verily, into peradventure, noted
(by their Jesuit Maldonate) to be contrary unto the most ancient Greek
authors.

21 In Ephesians. 1. 14. in stead of the Greek word Ephesians 1. 14. Dedit nobis
Spiritum suum Pignus (Graece Arrham, seu Arrhabonem) haereditatis]
(...), which (being the spirit of God) is the earnest of our inheritance, the
Latin uses Pignus, saying, [which is the pledge of our inheritance.] Hereupon
Augustinus annotaint, melius habere codices, qui habent Arrham, quim qui
Pignus: nam -- redd ta pecun ^ mutu ^ accepta restituitu^ pignus; Arrha autem
soluto integro precio non redditur, quia est pars pretij ipsius: vnde Gracae
literae and Grae^ is Interpretibus, and rei etiam ipsi magis conuenit nomen
Arrhabonis, quia Spiritus sanctus coelestis haereditatis Arrha non redditur,
quemadmodum Arrha reddi non solet. Salmeron Ies. com. in hunc locum, disp. 4..
Ad quartum.
S. Augustine notes [as says their Jesuit Salmeron) that the Greek
translation is the better; because when a man repaieth money, which was
borrowed, the pledge is restored unto him: but an earnest is a part of a man's
payment, and is not taken from him; and does better express the nature of Gods
holy spirit, which, as the earnest of the heavenly inheritance, does continue
for ever with us. In Ephesians. 2. 10. Creati sumus in Christo Jesus (Graec. (...))
ad bona opera. Vulg. in bonis operibus.
Ephesians. 2. 10. the Greek text is, [we are created in Christ Jesus unto good
works:] in the Latin, We are created in good works. Non satis commode vertit
vulg Interpres; -- commodius erat non sic vertere, ne ind^ quis ansam sumeret
operibus imputandi suam creationem in Christo: nihil enim magis a Paulo
alienum, qui vbique eam gratiam operibus nosti is abrogat, and vni Christo ex
ass ascribit. Vega Opuse. de Merit. and Iustific. qu. 6. Neque satis. page 802.
Which is no sit interpretation (says their Vega,) because we are to beware
lest that some take occasion from the Latin; to attribute the cause of their
creation in Christ, unto his (meaning, fore*seene) good works; then the which
nothing can bemore contrary unto S. Paul's judgment. In Ephesians. 5. 32. Hoc est
magnum Sacramentum.
Ephesians. 5. 32. where there is mention of matrimony, the vulgar reads, This
is a great Sacrament: and of the Salmeron Ies in hunc locum.
Romanists, the word Sacrament is here understood properly; Hoc est magnum
Sacramentum, pro Mysterium. Non habes ex hoc loco, prudens Lector, a Paulo,
coniugium esse Sacramentum; non enim dicit Sacramentum, sed mysterium hoc
magnum est. Card. Cai^t. com. in hunc locum.
But cannot be euinced from this place (says Cardinal Caietane) wherein the
Greek is (...), mystery: as accordingly An sit Sacramentum, olim de bitatum
erat ab orthodoxis Scholasticis. -- Ex his Apostoliverbis non videtur admodu^
efficaciter colligi, siquide^ particula aduersatiua, Ego aute^, ^atis indicat
hoc magnum mysterium ad Christum and Ecclesiam pertine^e, non ad ma^itum and
vxorem. Erasmus annot in hunc locum.
Erasmus observes.

22 In Heb. 11 21. Et Jacob adorauit fastigium virgae.
Heb. 11. 21. in the Greek it is, Jacob worshipped at, or, upon; signifying
(as says their Jesuit Graece, super fastigium, scil. nixus baculo erus. Sa
Ies. notat. in eum locum.
Sa) his leaning upon his staff: but the vulgat Latin thus, Jacob adored the
top of his rod; whereupon the Rhemists annot. in Heb. 11. 21.
Rhemists make this collection: Observe in those words (say they) that
adoration (as the Scripture uses this word) may be done to creatures, or to
God, at and before a creature. -- All this was done (by adoring the rod) in
type and figure of Christ's scepter, whom he adored, etc. Thus do they descant,
and all to prove an adoration of creatures, although In illo tempore in tantum
abhorrebant ab adorandis vllis rebus creatis, soli Deo hoc honoris servants;
cum hodie repertum sit -- igneam statua^ eadem adoratione adorari, qu^ adoratur
aeterna Trias. Erasmus in eundemlocum, page 583.
in those times (as is confessed) they altogether abhorred adoration of
creatures. If this be not clear enough yet, let us further consult with their
own Meminerit Epistolam hanc non Graece primum, sed Hebraice, hoc est, Syriace

23 These so manv and so notorious faults of the vulgar translation after so
long searching, sifting, and winnowing it from all former chafe, being still
remaining in (as they call it) their most perfect translation, by turning he
into she, contrary unto the sense of the holy Ghost: seeking to establish
their own errors of free will, of merit, and superstitious adoration; by
changing verily into peradventure; Gods good will unto man, into man's good will
toward God, and in good works, into unto good works; and upon the staff, into
The staff: besides the occasioned scandal of the Jews at Moses horns, and
of the seduceme^t of the Manichees by the tabernacle of the sun; and the
hinderance of confuting Jews by understanding of the kissing of the son of
God, Christ Jesus; and of the comfort of Gods assurance through his spirit,
which of an earnest they have made but a pledge, etc. not to recount the
formerlesse material, albeit inexcusable faults, and all so fully confessed by
the best learned of their church: what do they else pronounce, but first that
the doctrine of the Council of Trent is a very innovation, whilst it prescribed

vulgar Latin translation (used in the Romish Church) to be authe^tical, which
none upon whatsoever pretense may presume to reject?

24 Secondly, that the Protestants are so much more zealous professors of
antiquities, as they do more carefully seek to fetch their wat^rs of life from
the spring of the purest originals of Gods word, rather then from such rivers,
which are known to be mudded with corruptand vnsauo^y iniectments: and this
the rather, because (as their Aquinas has truly observed) Irridendi occasionem

Atheists are prone to take occasion of scorning the truth of God, when as
divine things are not divinely handled and performed. See next

A confessed Romish Innovation, in the inhibition of the public use of the
Scriptures in the vulgar tongue.
SECT. 4.
25 We may permit their Jesuit Azorius to act all the parts in this scene:
First, showing that the doctrine of Protestants (which he calls heresy) is
Lutherani and Caluinistae in ea haeresi sunt, vt asserant Scripturas sacras
transserri debere in vulgares omnium gentium linguas.
to teach, that the holy Scriptures ought to be translated into the vulgar
languages of all Christians: against whom Contra quos in Indice librorum
prohibitorum edito a Conc Tridentino 4. regula constituta sic h^bet. -- Cum
experientia manifestum est, sacra Biblia vulgari lingua passim sine discrimine

nisi facultate a Praelatis suis habita, ea legere aut em^re possint.
the Council of Trent published a rule, forbidding every one of the common
people, yea and of Regulars, to read or retain any vulgar translation,
without the license of their Bishops, or Inquisitor: which is so commanded,
upon pretense, that the common use of Scriptures is by experience found to be
rather hurtful then profitable. And lest that by the first rule of license,
their Officials in this kind might make the Bible too common, Et in Indice

Pope Clement the eight would give no new faculties either unto Bishops, or
Inquisitors, or any superiors over the Regulars, to grant any license of
reading the Bible in a known tongue. And as though there were a greater mist
in Spain then in Rome, he tells us, that In Hispania tamen in Indice
librorum prohibitorum ibi edito, a^thoritate generalis, in illis prouincijs,
Inquisitotis, Reg. 6. sic habet: Prohibentur Biblia vulgari lingua, cum omnibus

no Bibles, or any parts of them, printed in the vulgar language, are permitted
to be had in Spain: so far are they from giving allowance unto such
translations of Bibles, as Quaeres insuper, an permittantur scripti vulgari

not to permit them to read those translated parts of Psalms and songs, which
are contained in their prayers.

26 But we object, that Objicies sacras literas olim vernaculis fuisse linguis
conscriptas: nam Moses, and alij veteris Testam. scriptores sacri, Hebraica
lingua, qua tunc temporis ^udaei scripsere, -- caeteri vero noui Testam. libri
Graece sunt conscripti, quia Ortentalium Gentium, quae in Romans Imperio and
ditione viuebant, erat propria lingua: and in Ecclesia Latina sacri and diuim
libri Latin sunt redditi, propterea quod omnes tunc temporis Latin
loquebantur, and intelligebant.
anciently, in the dates of Moses, the Scriptures were written in the common
language of the people: that the books of the new Testament were written in
Greek, which was the vulgar language of the East parts of the world: that they
were tra^s^ated into Latin at what time Latin was vulgarly spoken in Italy.
And now we expect his answer, Respondeo, tunc hisce tribus linguis Scriptores
sacros vsos fuisse, quia Scripturae sacrae id temporis apud Gentes promulgari
coeperunt, and proinde in his linguis editae ac traditae fuere, quae tunc in
vsu erant apud Gentium nationes. Azorius Ies. ibid.
I answer (says he) that Scriptures in those times were to be published
through all nations, and therefore were they made common by those three
languages.

27 This antiquity is as good as can be required: but yet we seek for more
evidence then this, the rather because our Adversaries use to scoff at
Protestants, accounting it a matter of Rhemists Preface unto their translation:
and, Haec profanatio efficiet sutores and sartores, imo (quod ^idiculum est)
sutrices and sartrices, mirabili metamorphosi, in prophetrices and doctrices
conuerti. Salmeron Ies. com. in 1. Cor. 16. disp. 30. and Ledesima Ies. de
diuinis Script. cap 31.
profanation to allow men, women, children, bakers, laborers, and tinkers,
the use of vulgar translations, and to become Prophets and Prophetesses. We
wonder what spirit these men are of; surely neither of Moses in the old
Testament, nor of Peter's in the new: for Moses wished that Numb. 11. 29.
all the people of God could prophecy; and Peter being instructed by a A^ts
10. 11. 12.
vision of birds, beasts, creeping things etc. and a voice saying, What God had
hallowed, man must not call either common or profane, thereupon learned a
lesson, that there is no respect of persons with God, but whosoever (whether
man or woman, wife, maid, tinker, or cobbler) fears God, and work^th
righteousness, is accepted of God: and shall the reading and knowledge of God
be now called profaneness?

28 Nevertheless we covet to have this decided by some more large and
confessed antiquity. Our Adversaries cannot deny, that Obijcies Chrysostomum
terque quaterque asserentem, -- assiduam Scripturarum lectionem esse singulis
necessari^m. -- Et ^^eronymum ad Paulam and Eustochium, hortantem eas ad

S. Chrysostom held it a thing necessary for all men daily to read the
Scriptures: whereunto S. Hierome did exhort diverse women. To the which end
there are recorded ancient translations of Hebraici libri conuersi erant in

Bibles into the language of the Goths and other nations: which we willingly
confess (says their Jesuit) to have been in use among the people of those
times, because the Scriptures were then in the Greek and Latin tongue, which
was understood of the vulgar people. But (what now?) now the common people are
rude and ignorant of Latin. Here we see a flat change, even in the Church of
Rome, but not by the peoples ignorance, as our adversaries pretend, but rather
(as we may think) by the negligence o^ wilfulness of their Pastors, who would
not suffer the^ to feed in the pastures of comfort, the sacred Scriptures, as
did the Apostles and their successors. Doubtless seeing that Latin Confessed
above.
Bible was it self a vulgar translation, it may teach them to translate the
Bible into other vulgars, as Italian and Spanish, etc. that the people, though
rude of language, may notwithstanding cease to be rude in the knowledge of Gods
law.

29 But we must not plead equity, where our only question is antiquity,
whereof we have had the direct confession of their learned Bishop, affirming,
that Iud ^i filios, etc. Claudius ^spencaeu^ See above lib 3. cap. 16 Sect. 3.
the Jews brought up their children in the reading of holy writ: (witness S.
Paul in his commendation of 2 Timothy 3. 15.
Timothy) and accounts it a s^ame for Christians to be wanting in the like
exercise, confirming his assertion, viz. the public use of, at least, some
Scriptures, from the common complaint (as he calls it) of ancient Fathers,
the exhortation of the Quid clarius quim quod Paulus sic hortatur ad Coloss 3.
Ve^bum Christi habitet in vobis (quibus autem vobis? ijs qui sunt Colossis,
sanctis, and fidel^bus fratribus in Christo, Col. 1.) Verbum ergo Christi

that that custom should be judged now dangerous and pestiferous, which unto
the ancient and orthodoxall Fathers seemed so wholesome and commodious.

30 This displaieth the now Romish inhibition to be but, indeed, a pernicious
Innovation, whereby Rome, of a mother, is become a stepdame, dehorting her
people from the reading of Scripture, because, forsooth, of the marvelous

their own Jesuit Acosta, who says, that Ita prouidit dul^is Pater, vt multa

our gracious God has maruellously provided in holy writ, that the most rude
reading in humility, may profit thereby: secondly, against experience; Vidi

I have seen (says he) some men utterly unlearned, and scarce knowing Latin,
who have gathered out of the Scripture such prosound knowledge, that I
marvelled at them; but the spiritual man judges all things: thirdly, against
the formerly confessed custom of antiquity, which is corroborated by the
testimony of Solent medici praebere interdum cibum aliquem, interdum etiam and

Of the confessed Innovation of public prayer in an unknown tongue, and the
iniquity thereof.
SECT. 5.
31 The affinity which there is between known Scriptures and known prayers
(those wherein God speaks unto us, these wherein we speak unto God,) has
occasioned us to yield unto prayer the next place of examination. The state of
the question is thus truly explaned by our adversaries: Ecclesia nostra
prohibet, ne diuina offic^a and prae^ertim Missae sacrifi^ium, in vulgari
lingua celeb^etur: and Conc. Triden. Sess 22. c. 8. and 9. tradit, aliter

anathematized. Notwithstanding we persist in our doctrine, and wish that
antiquity may be the touchstone of truth herein.

32 Our Adversaries themselves have saved us much labor in the search of the
allegation of Fathers, by confessing, 1. That Hoc ipsum veteri Testamento,
Moyse mandata Dei ena^rante, fieri consueuisse, apparet Deuteronomy. 27. and 1. Paral.

a long time after (this is Cardinal Bellarmine his confession) this custom
continued both in the East and West Churches, which he proves out of
Chrysostom and Cyprian. 4. That even in Rome also, according unto the
testimony of S. Hierome, the faith of the people is greatly commended for
slocking together unto public Service, where their voices, with (as it were)
an heavenly thundering, resounded Amen, as both their Hieronym. Praef. ad lib 2
com. in Epist ad Galat. Romanae, inquit, plebis laudatur sides: vbi alibi tanto

quatiuntur? Durantus de ritib. lib. 2 cap. 17. page 307.
Durantus, and Cardinal Bellarm. above at the letter. g.
Bellarmine do ingenuously acknowledge. But when and why was the change? Tunc,
quia Christiani pauci erant, omnes simul p^allebant, and intelligebant, and
respondebant, Amen. At postea crescente populo, diuisa sunt magis officia, and
solis Clericis relictum, vt communes preces peragerent. Bellar. lib. 2 de verbo
Dei cap. 16.. At obijcies.
Then (says the same Cardinal,) the Christians did all sing Psalms together,
and answer Amen, because they were yet but few; but afterward when the number
of Christians was multiplied, the office of saying public Service was divided,
and it was left only unto the Clerk to celebrate the Commonpraiers. Here he
grants an alteration, but how? Hac in re mirum est, quam mutata sit Ecclesiae
consuetudo. Erasmus in 1. Cor. 14.
We marvel (says Erasmus) how it came in.

33 Our Reader need not to be moved to consider these points. First, a
confessed antiquity of the peoples praying understandingly both in the old
Testament before Christ, and after his coming, in the new: both in the days of
the Apostles, and after until the days of S. Hi^rome and S. Chrysostom,
which was 380 years: both in the East and in the West parts of Christendom,
and that also in Rome it self. Here is antiquity primitive, and Apostolical.

34 Secondly, that after these times this custom was altered: here is a
change, but why? Their Cardinal renders no better reason the^ because (says
he) the people began to increase; which reason is found to be both False: for
in the days of S. Hierome and S. Chrysostom (in whose time this custom is
said to have been continued) the congregations of Christian people in public
Service were as frequent as ever since: for S. Hierome has been brought in by
Durantus (lit. h.) commending the congregatitus in Rome for studium and
frequentia: and Chrysostom. does joy much in the great concourse of people unto
the Churches. See his (...) ad populum Antiochenum. And if in Rome the
congregation had not been most frequent, their Amen should not have been
compared unto a thunder by S. Hierome.
false and Foolish: for his reason of alteration is, because whilst as
Christians were few, they understood their prayers, and said Amen; but upon the
increase of people, the office of Amen was allotted unto a Clerk: as though it
were not as easy a m^tter for many, as for a few to learn to say, Amen.
foolish. Thirdly, that when we would know the time and actors of this change,
we are answered with a mirum est, that is, It is a marvel how this change came
in. This makes the former challenge of the Apologists appear to be
ridiculous, wherein they (contrary to experience both in this, and infinite
other alterations) have exacted of us a demonstration of persons, time, and
place, for the proof of our objected changes: especially seeing that here Rome
herself is now confessed to have altered her profession in a principal and
necessary point of religion; and yet cannot show us either by whom, or when
she made this Innovation.

35 Have we said, that it is a principal and necessary point of, Christian
Religion? Yes verily; and this will be worthy our due consideration, the
rather because in the state of the controversy, the difference between the
Protestants and Romanists is thus laid: the Romanists teach only a licere,
scil. that it is lawful for the Church to use the public Service in the
native and known language of Christian people: Protestants furthermore contend
for a debere, scil. that it thus ought to be; and are for this position
anathematized in their last Council. And yet how easily, to our Adversaries
blush, might the necessity hereof be euineed? But we confine our selves within
the bounds of a confessed equity. Now then to the point it self.

36 Although this confessed Apostolical, and primitive antiquity does, even
in that name, carry with it a sufficient proof of the equity of our
profession, teaching a necessary use of a language commonly understood of the
people, in the public worship of God; yet will this be much more perswasible
by the confessed properties of known prayer: for our Adversaries have
condescended to grant, that, if we respect the good of them that pray, the
known prayer is more behoouefull for the peoples Hac Pauli doctrina habetur
quod melius est ad aedificatione^ Ecclesiae, orationes publicas, quae audiente

Bellarmine, and by Aquinas, the chief Doctor of their Romish School. And did
ever any antiquity think that these three were not necessarily to be
cherished and fostered in Gods people, as he vital parts of holy worship? Quod
si populus intelligit orationem, seu been dictionem sacerdotis, melius
reducitur in Deum, and deuotius respondet, Amen. ^yra in 1. Cor. 14.
If the people (says their Lyra) understand the prayer of the Priest, they are
better reduced unto God, in praying unto him, and saying, Amen.

37 If we regard the Apostles doctrine concerning the Common prayer in the
Church, it is certain that he will have the congregation to say, Amen, which is
to yield their open and express consent unto the public prayer: but of the
ignorant of the language of prayer, he says, 1. Cor. 14.

paraphrase,) Quomodo enim dicet, Ame^, cum quid orat ne^cit?] quia non potest

How shall he say Amen, when he prays he knows not what? because he
understands not, quid boni dicas, but only quod benedicas, and therefore
Optandum videtur, vt iuxta Apostolicum mandatum, and priscum Ecclesiae morem in
publicis Ecclesiae precibus, cantionibus, and lectionibus, quae populi causa
suscipiuntur, populi ratio habeatur, neque in totum ac perpetuo ab omni
communione precum arceatur. Manifesta sunt verba Apostoli, cum qui ob
imperitiam, quod dicitur, non intelligit, fieri non posse vt ad alterius
gratiarum actionem Amen respondeat. Cassander Defens. offic. pij viri, contra
Caluinum. page 141.
be cannot possibly (says Cassander) say Amen unto the giving of thanks: which
made him wish that according unto the Apostles command, and custom of the
primitive Church, the faithful people of God may be better respected. This
seems to be more then reasonable unto their Faber, who complaining, says,
that Maxima pars hominum, cum nunc orat, nescio si spiritu, tamen in mente non
orat; nam in lingua orat, quam non intelligit: at Paulus maxim probat, vt
fideles pariter spiritu orent and mente. Faber in 1. Cor. 14. fol. 1-3. b.
the greatest number of people at this day pray not with their understanding;
but S. Paul (says he) will have all men to pray with their understanding also.

38 If lastly we consider the glory of God, either as it is in their own
story recorded by Aenaeas Syluius, (wherein it is said, that Et Oraculum illud,
cuius monitu Ponti^ex Romanus (vt est apud Aeneam Syluium, hist. Bohem. lib. 1.
cap. 13) cum senatu Cardinalium Sclauorum genti concessisse dicitur. vt patri^
lingu^ in sacris operandis vteretur^a ^omnes gentes pertinere videtur: Omnis
spi^itus laudet Deum. Cassander quo supra, verbisseq.
when the Pope and his Cardinals were in deliberation, whether they should
yield unto the request of the Sclauonians, who desired to have their prayers in
their country language, he was moved to consent, by hearing an Oracle
answering, Let every spirit praise the Lord: which voice (as Cassander has
well noted) does as well command a liberty for all people:) or by the
acknowledged poperties of known prayers, to wit, the more edification, more
consolation, more devotion in the worshippers of God; which consequently do
avail unto the better worshipping of God both in spirit and truth: how then
shall not the Roman Church be judged an Innouator, which has so strangely
departed from so Apostolical, primitive, equal and necessary a point of
Christian religion?

CHAP. XIX.
That Popedom it self is a confessed Innovation in diverse particulars, in
respect of the Popes spiritual jurisdiction: and in the first place of their
change in form, in titles, in name.
SECT. 1.
IT is held a timorous dastardie for a man in battelling to forbid the striking
at the head; and no less diffidence it might seem to be, if our Adversaries
in this question, concerning degeneration from antiquity, should except the
Pope, whom they adore for the monarchical head of the Church, the Vicar of
Christ, the universal Bishop, and supreme Judge, by whose doom Porro subesse
Romans Pontifici omm humanae creaturae declaramus, dicimus, d^simmus, and
pronunciamus omnino esse de necessitate salutis. Extrauag. de Mator. and Obed.
Vnam Sanctam. The Author of it was Bonifacius 8. as the Gloss thereupon
shows. See more above, Cap. 2.. 4. number. 17.
every one is pronounced to be necessarily out of the state of salvation, who
is not subject unto the Pope himsel^e. We therefore shall prove even from our
Adversaries confessions, the Pope (as he is now magnified in the Romish
profession) to be not only an Innouator, but even an Innovation it self, both
in regard of the spiritual and temporal state, by many novel and notorious
abuses.

2 The first is in assuming to be Vnicus: for as their Cardinal Bellarmine
cannot deny but that Ecclesia est vna and eade^ omni tempore: non debet igitur
mutari forma regiminis. Bell. lib. 2. de Pont. ca. 12.. Secu^do ex.
the Church, which is but one, should at all times keep one and the same form
of government: so does he confess, that Fuit enim in illis Ecclesiae
primordijs necessarium ad fidem toto orb terrarum celeriter disseminandam, vt
primis praedicatoribus, and Ecclesiarum fundatoribus summa potest as and
libertas concederetur. Mortuis autem Apostolis, Apostolica authoritas in solo
Petrisuccessore permansit. Bellar. lib. 1. de Pontif. cap. 9.. Fuit enim.
whereas in the first founding of Christian Churches, a supreme power was
communicated unto all the chief builders; yet (says he) as soon as the
Apostles were dead, the Apostolical authority did abide only in the successor
of S. Peter, meaning the Pope. And can many and one, a common and a proper,
that and another be without alteration?

3 Secondly, as the Pope will be Vnicus, that is, alone, so will he be also
called Vniuersalis, even See above lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 29.
the universal Bishop of the Church: See in the same place.
which title none of my Predecessors (says S. Gregory, who lived about the 600
year) ever consented unto; but his successor See above lib. 4 cap. 11.
Boniface 3. is found to have been first guilty of this vsurpatio^. And why may
not the Popes be thought to have innouated in assuming the title of universal
Bishop, who are confessed to have appropriated unto themselves the very name of
Papa, that is, Pope, Gregorius 7. Papa conuentu Romae habito, inter alia
constituit, vt solus Romans Pont. Papa diceretur: olim enim, vt constat ex

which formerly (says their Jesuit) was common unto other Bishops? the which
alteration was made (about the year 1073.) by Gregory the 7. even as also the

4 Thirdly, how can it seem strange that he should affect the foresaid So. S.
Gregorycen ured the title of Vniueriall Bishop. See above lib. 1. cap. 2.. 29.
Antichristian title, who has put away his own Christian name, whilst (which
is confessed) every Pope at his ent^ance into the Popedom, Primus honos Rom*

Popes.
SECT. 2.
5 From his appellation we come to try his election. Ratio eligendi
Pontificem, qui nunc est in Ecclesia, non est de iure diuino -- ratio est, quia
ordo Cardinalium, qui nunc sunt electores, non est ex iure diuino. Franciscus
de Victoria Relect. 2. prop. 11.
The manner hereof (says their Victoria) which is now in use, is not from
divine authority, because the order of Cardinals, by whom he is chosen, is not
ordained by God. Then have some Romish Doctors been deceived, who have
Quaeritur an ordo Cardinalium (not as they are Priests and Deacons, but as in
the degree of Cardinals) sit iuris diuini? he alleges many authors both pro
and contra. Azor. Ies. Instit. Moral. part. 2. lib. 4. cap. 1. page 399.
thought it to have been from divine ordinance: as though it had been intimated
by that place of Ibid.
Scripture, where it is said, 1. Reg. 2. Domini sunt cardines terrae: and
indeed, they have greatly deluded themselves, as their chief Jesuits do
confess. As for the Scripture which they allege, it is (as their own Jesuit
Azorius shows) childishly Locus 1. Reg. 2. Domini sunt Cardines terrae:] Non
probat, vt etiam Panormitanus probat, Cardinales esse iure diuino institutor.

mis-sensed. We might say (with their Polydore) that they have herein imitated
Shoomakers, who stretch out their leather beyond compass with their sordid
teeth.

6 When then, and how had this creature (whom they call a Cardinal) his birth
and growth? Alij Ca^dinalium originem existimant a Greg. 1. alij a Syluestri

Some say (says their Jesuit) from Pope Gregory the first, some from
Syluester, some from Marcellus. Such a kind of doubtful brood is called
terraefilius. Will they permit their Polydore to blazon them? Sane hi Marcellum

Pope Marcellus (Anno 304.) of the 25 Parishes which were then in Rome,
appointed fifteen of them to be cardinal and principal, in respect of the
rest; the Ministers of thesewere hereupon called Cardinals, having the chief
care of baptizing Infants, and of burying the dead: this (says he) was their
first original. But afterward when Pope Boniface the third, Anno 605. had
obtained of the Emperor Phocas, the prerogative of headship over all other
Bishops, then began he to advance his senate of those Cardinal Priests, whom
he drew nearer unto himself for the public government of the Church; and thus
by little and little they ascended unto their present dignity. To what dignity?

I confess (says Cardinal Bellarmine) that in former times about the days
of S. Gregory, Bishops had the precede^cy of Cardinals, but afterward (that
is, after the year 600) when as these Cardinals had got the power to be the
sole electors of the Pope, they began to be advanced above Bishops: Meo quidem

8 Here we do perceive a new order, and in it diverse disorderly Innouations:
as namely, that Cardinals, albeit but Priests or Deacons, are preferred before
Bishops, although Patriarchs; and Provincial and Episcopal Councels changed
into conclaues and consistories: those ouertopping (in their judgment) an
ordinance of God, by the new invention of man in the Cardinals, who grew up by
little and little to be an order, which only both electeth the Pope, and from
which only the Pope elected must be selected: ^ccundum P^nt. Romanu^ (vt^ eos

13 Fifthly, what has been of late years more stood upon than the mannaging of
peculiar cases of conscience, in the Consistory of the Pope? Notwithstanding,
Hoc enim loco Cyprianus peculiares Episcopos inuicem comparat, qui parem
potestatem habebant circa sua ouilia. Nec enim tunc erant casus peculiares
conscientiae ipsi Pontifici reseruati, proinde quisque poterat, quae alij in
sua dioecesi, and ob eam causam partem sui Episcopatus in solidum tenebat.
Salmeron Ies. in 1. Pet. 5. disp. 8.. Et dicendo.
in the days of S. Cyprian (who lived Anno 240.) peculiar cases of conscience
were not reserved unto the judgment of the Pope of Rome, as their Jesuit
Salmeron confesses, and proves from the testimony of S. Cyprian. And we have
heard, that their Popes claim of Appeals unto Rome, in the days of S.
Augustine, was (in the Council of Afric, wherein S. Augustine had his voice)
See above, lib. 2. cap. 21.
rejected, as both false, new, and unreasonable. So many, and so maine are the
Innouations in this one: whose titles both of Pope* and of universal Bishop;
whose election by Cardinals only, and only out of Cardinals: whose pretended
office of Infallibility of judgment, and peremptory opposition unto the
Councels, in abrogating of their decrees, by a presumption of a commandatory
fullness of authority, which they extend unto Appeals, and cases reserved:
have been all acknowledged to be new aberrations from the profession of the
ancient Church of Rome, and all (excepting one) to have been hatched after the
time of S. Gregory, who governed that See about the year 600 after Christ.

Other confessed Romish Innouations of Popedom against the temporal state of
Emperors and Kings.
SECT. 4.
14 Hitherto we have spoken of the Popes spiritual sword; now the temporal
sword, which he also challenges, is brought unto the test, and must be tried,
by the judgment of our Adversaries, what metal it is made of, and what time,
and how it was hammered and framed.

15 We have seen throughout this Treatise, the now Romish claim to challenge
over all temporal powers, as a superiority in place, so also a sovereignty
of dominion in temporal cases, at the least, indirectly: albeit they are not
ignorant, that that might be proved by many examples of the best antiquity,
which their own Bishop has summarily confessed from that Scripture, where it
is written: Romans 13. 1.
Let every soul be subject to the higher powers etc: viz. that Omnis anima.]

the first general Councels were called by the Christian Emperors command.

17 Secondly, Verumtamen quacunque ratione ad Pantificatum pateret ingressus,
nemo Apostolicae cymbae gubernacula capescebat, ni prius autho^itas Imperatoris
intercessi^let, vt cap. Hadrianus, Can Synodo 63. did. mos enim apud veteres
inualuerat, longo annorum decu^su obseruatus, vt clerus populusque Romans
Pontificem eligeret* quo designato, in Imperatoris manu erat, electionem istam
raram i^ritamve habere Cap. Agatho did. 63. and vt collubitum fuit, aut illum
admittere comprobareque, aut illo reiecto atque exploso, alterum surrogare,
perdurauitque is mos vsque ad Hadrianum, (anno salutis ^15) qui tanti animi
^uit, vt initio Pontificatus sui ad senatum populumque Rom, retulerit, ne in
creando Pontifice Imperatoris potestas expectaretur, vtque libera essent cleri
populique Rom suffragia. Sed huic edicto minime fuit obtemperatum, permansitque
vetus illa consuetudo Pontificis ab Imperatore consirmandi (verba Platinae
sunt) in vita Greg. 9. anno 1227. quando Gregor. 9. in gratiam cum Henrico
Imperatore redijt, qui cum in Pont. Romans confirmauit, vt tunc temporis mos
erat. Hieron. Balbus Episc. de Coronat. page 29. 30.
in former times (says their Bishop Balbus) the election of the Pope was
confirmed by Christian Emperors, until the year 815. at what time Pope
Adrian interrupted that custom: albeit afterward it did recover the former
strength, as appears in the election of Pope Gregory the ninth, Anno 1227,
who after his election was confirmed by the favor of Henry the Emperor. But
what now? Vnde tam noua rerum facies eruperit tantaque labentis Imperij facta
sit immutatio? That is (as the question of that Section shows) vnde euenerit
vt mutato vetere instituto, Imperator confirmetur a Pontifice? Balbus ibid.
page 30.
Now (says he) there is a new face and fashion of things; whilst as the
Emperor has nothing to do with the approbation of the Popes election, but
c^ntra^iwise the Pope does confirm the election of the Emperor. Where
although among our Ciuilium legum interpretes non desinunt, and causantur astu
potius doloque, quam ex aequo and bono tam ce^ta diuturnaque priu^legia
Cae^ares amisisse, and (vt inquiunt Bal. and Albe) ex longa Imperij vacatione

aliorum Romans Ecclesiae Praesidum esse ademptum. Sed hi, mea quidem sententia, a
recta semita declinarunt. -- (Then he pretends three causes) Imperatores
primlegia illa a se abdicasse, vel ex abusu perdidisse, vel cessante causa
priuilegiorum, priuilegium euanuisse. Balbus quo supra, page 30 and 31.
Adversaries some impute the cause of this change unto the ind^lgences of
Emperors, or policy of Popes; others unto the abuse of that privilege in the
Emperors, and other conjectures: yet do all of them liberally confess (which
answers our question,) that there is herein an immutation and change.

18 Thirdly, in the right of tribute, they do accordingly grant, that Hoc
confecto, demendus est scrupulus ex animo quorundam, q^i anxie percunctantur,

in the primitive constitution of the Church, the Churches about Rome were
contributarie unto the Emperor. And they dispute how, and why they should be
now free? And not so only, but afterward (as their Thuanus notes) they Nota

were (...) unto the Pope, were prohibited: but when yet again through craft

from the passion of Christ (says their Tolossanus) for the space of almost
300 years, (in the five persecutions made by Emperors) Christians, when they
were of equal force to resist, did never rebel against the Emperors, nor
attempted any faction, but did herein magnify their Christian profession ab^^e
all other religions through a patient endurance of all extre^^t^es, giving the
world to understand, that they did not ambitiously emulat^ and affect hono^rs
and governments in this world, but gloried and contented themselves with the
interest, which, through hope, they had in Christ. Nay, Nemo sanctorum P^trum,

no orthodoxall Father (says their Barkley, confuting the rebellion against
Kings) did by word or writing teach any such resistance for the space of a
thousand years, although they lived under many tyrants, and sometime had
sufficient force. Amongst others, Pope Leo is observed by their Cardinal
Cusanus to have submitted himself unto the penal statutes of the Emperor
Martianus. When then, and where shall we find an alteration? Primus

place alleged (...). 26. cap. 5.
The first man we read of in all ancient story (says their Bishop Espencaeus)
was Hildebrand, (that is, Pope Gregory the seventh) who making a schism
between the Ecclesiastical and temporal state, listed up his lance against
the Imperial diadem, excommunicating the Emperor: by whose exam^le the after
Popes were animated to excommunicate Emperors, and raise up their sub^eels
against them.

Other confe^sed Innouations in their Popes, in relinquishing the principal
function of Pastors, which is preaching.
SECT. 5.
21 So much have they been addicted unto worldly and temporal pomp, and so
long a time, that they have forgotten the proper and principal office of a
Pastor, which is, the preaching of the word: for Fuerunt tame ante haec tempora
sanctiss. Patres, qui singulis Dommicis ad populum homilias decla(...)irunt:
extant enim ad hunc diem conciones praesertim Leonis, and Gregorij. ^^ffens.
Episcop^^, art. 33.. Quid.
before these times (says their Bishop Roffen^^s) there were of the Popes, who
did by Sermons instruct the p^^^^e. So they were, but now, Non tenentur
Pontifices per se concionati, and Sacramenta ministrare, si iusta aliqua de
causa impediantur, sed satis est, si curent per alios ista omnia praestari.
Bellar. lib. 3. de Pont. cap. 24. Add.
although the Popes (says Cardinal Bellarmine) do not now preach, yet it is
sufficient if they provide that preaching be performed by others.

22 This custom of not preaching is but a babe in Christianity, and the
defense thereof a new point of learning in Christ's school: which their Bishop
E^peneae^s has largely and religiously discussed by example of antiquity.
Quanquam quid in Rom^ ^cclesia superiores Historie^ obseruarunt, non video, qui
cum tot Leonis 1. Gregorij 1. and Innocent. 2. and siqui tal^s Romae alij
(...)unt Episcopi ijdem and Ecclesiastae, tot ad vrbis Clerum and populum
Homilijs conueniat. Leo sane adeo huius se (...) (...)bitorem agnouit, deque eo

cap. 2. page 255.
I do not perceive (says he) how this not-preaching can agree with the
examples of Pope Leo the first, Gregory the first, and of Innocentius the
second, (who lived about the year 1130.) besides others, whom historians have
observed to have been preaching Bishops: amongst whom Leo professed that is was
not free for him to forbear this exercise. The same Espencaeus proceeds:
Adeo portenti insta^ habitum fuisset, si quis se pro Episcopo habuisset, qui
non etiam and reipsa verum and proprium hoc Ep^^copi munus exhibuisset* quod
hodie plus quam monstri loco haberetur, si quis exhiberet. Ibid. page 254.
Quotusquisque Pra^latorum ma(...)um, mino(...) populum suum docere videtur? an
illi ipsi decreti huius authors vnquam docuerunt? quorum exemplo alij ad
docendum, aliaque munera sua facienda excitarentur? Certe ex nostratibus
Episcopis, qui Tridenti ac Bononiae pars aliquota fueru^t, nemo per se (quod
quidem audiuerim) docet. Ludimus ne in re adeo seria? an potius hac decretorum
specie reformationem poscentibus illudimus? Quid eme^dationis sperari potest a
nobis, nostra tam recens edita non obseruantibus? Noui Episcopos etiam Graece
peritos, qui se vt ad istam docendi seruitutem demittant, ad istas sordes
descendant (generosi scil. and excelsi viri) teneri praefracte negant: quod cum
Episcopatus ass cuti sunt, mos is non esset, quasi contra perpetua^ Dei legem,
vlla hominum praeualuit desuetudo magis quam consuetudo: quos cum omnis omnium
temporum natura, Scriptura, Ecclesia, Concilia, Pontifices Caesares, superi,
inferi accusent, damnentque, quis est qui absoluat? Ibid. page 257.
It was no less a wonder (says he, speaking of ancient times) for to be
called a Bishop, and not to discharge this duty, tha^ he is now as rare as a
monster, who is seane to perform it. He is yet more bold. And whereas by the
Bishops of the Council of Trent, ses^. 4. preaching was defined to be the
chief office of Bishops: yet what one Bishop do we know (says he) either
greater or less of all them who were at that Council, who is seen to preach?
What do we sporting in a matter of earnest? or, under color of making Decrees,
do we mock them who call for reformation? I know some learned Bishops, who
standing upon their gentility, for sooth, and greatness, hold it a matter of
servitude and baseness to be exercised in preaching, because their
predecessors were not accustomed thereunto: and thus pretend only disuse. But
who shall absolve the^, whom nature, Church, Councels, Popes, Caesar's, and all
sorts of men do condemn?

23 The confession of this one particular does confront the Apologists, who
require an exactnotice of the persons and time of every notorious ch^nge; as
though it were not sufficient to show, by the confession of our Adversaries,
when a contrary custom was not, except we can as precisely express their
prime originals, as we can tell the^ that Gregorius Magnus instituit Rogationes
publicas -- mense Maio. Massomus in vita Pelag. 2. fol. 105.
Gregory was the first who instituted the public Rogations; and that Julius 2.
-- vt se formidabiliorem redderet, barbam sa^e prolixam aluit, contra morem
maiorum: nullus enim antea Pontifex barbatus extit erat. Massomus in vita Iulij
2 fol. 278.
Julius secundus was the first, who let his beard grow unto the full, that he
might seem more terrible; or that Memorabilis est Calendarij Romani correctio,
tentata quidem ab antecessoribus eius (Greg. 13.) sed adhibitis ad eam rem
insignibus Mathematicis, etc. Massomus in vita Greg. 13. page 420.
Gregory the thirteenth was the first, who reformed the Calender. But happy
had it been to all Christendom, if they had been as willing to reform their
doctrines according unto the form of pure antiquities: for then should we not
find (as is confessed) the Popes ancient subjection acknowledged unto Emperors,
changed into a Sovereignty above them; their being confirmed in their
elections by the Emperors, abolished; and an authority of confirming the
election of Emperors, usurped: the paying of tribute unto Emperors ceased,
and their exaction of tributes, contrary to the will of Emperors, intruded:
their submission unto the penal decrees of Emperors buried; and the arming of
subjects unto rebellion against Emperors, defended. Finally, the Popes
honoring of Emperors with the titles of my Lord, etc. abolished, and the
abasing of Emperors even to the kissing of their feet, authorized and
practiced. Can our Adversaries require either more notorious or more obnoxious
alteratio^s, than these appear to be, whose first authors and times have been
by our Adversaries themselves so thoroughly discovered?

the first Order of begging friars was of the Augustimans. What, shall we
think that S. Augustine prescribed them this art of begging? No, but it is the
wit of See lit. 1.
diverse Orders, to ascribe it unto S. Augustine, Hierome, Benedict, and other
holy Saints, as unto their authors, who were so far from ordaining any such
rule, that they did not peradventure so much as think thereof. In brief, See
above lib. 1 cap. 2. Sect. 38.
the now Monastical Order is degenerated from the ancient form.

3 Other such like confessions have our Adversaries yielded us concerning the
marriage of persons Ecclesiastical, as thus: See ab^ue lib. 1. cap. 2 and lib.

Marriage was permitted unto them for many hundred years after Christ: and See
ab^ue lib. 1. cap. 2 and lib. 4 cap. 9.

from Pope Syri^ius: whose authority notwithstanding, the use thereof See ab^ue

4 By these so many confessions of our Adversaries, we understand of manifold
Innouations and changes, as of labor into idleness, liberty into bondage,
marriage into divorce; and by occasion hereof, order into much disorder and
adulteries, as the often complaints of their own Doctors See above lib. 1. cap

Schoolmen concerning Matrimony and Confirmation. Therefore, notwithstanding
the color of antiquity, which our Adversaries shall cast upon them by the
naked name of Sacraments, which was given by Fathers unto a score of such like
figurative resemblances, these their confessions telling us, that they were not
instituted by Christ (who only has been acknowledged to have power to ordain
a Sacrament) do warrant our just exception against their pretense of
antiquity, by saying with Christ: From the beginning it was not so.

whereof they acknowledge, that (contrary unto the ancient and common custom)
they now give absolution, before the penitent have made his satisfaction; a
course very preposterous. And how can they truly esteem of their oil used in
Confirmation, as a necessary and essential part of the Sacrament, knowing that

Apostoli, ex diuina dispensatione, sola manuum impositione confirmabant; huius

it was not used by the Apostles? Neither may they be thought to be sparing in
inuenting Sacramental rites, who Proprie ordines ab Episcopo ordinati, and qui
ad certum ministerium sacrificio diuino ministrandum referuntur -- septem

was not accounted sacred in the eldest times.

3 Other their Sacraments we do not disprove, because our present scope is to
say no more, than which we may euince by the confessions of our Adversaries:
who have (as may appear) borne witness unto five Innouations in four
supposed Sacraments. And why may not they be suspected to have innouated in the
doctrine of the will of Christ our Testator, who have made bold thus to add
unto his seals? From improper Sacraments, we proceed unto a most proper one,
which is the Eucharist, showing examples.

CHAP. XXII.
Of other confessed Romish Innouations in the doctrine of Transubstantiation:
of the witholding the cup from the people: of not breaking of the bread: of
restraining men from taking it with their hands.
SECT. 1.
SVperstition is an Hagarine, which is naturally more fruitful then is the
truly espoused religious profession: which may be discerned in all points of
worship, but especially does it discover it self in the Sacrament of the
Eucharist. The first point (which has been mentioned) is the new Romish
Transubstantiation, founded (in their opinion) upon those words of Christ, This
is my body: Scotus lib 4. Sent did. 11. q. 3 aperte docet neque ex
Scripturae, neque ex Patrum sententijs nos adigi, vt Transubstantiationem
statuamus: -- Immo ingenue Scotus hanc fidem. --
Which sense (says their Scotus) we cannot be brought to believe, either by
any plain place of Scripture, or sentence of ancient Fathers. What need we
more? Yet Scripture is so little favorable unto their exposition, as that
their Ex solo Romans Ecclesiae decreto (cui in hac restare oporteat) esse
introductam. --

Biel profess, that except they had been preoccupated by the interpretation of
the Romish Church, they could not have yielded unto it. And the judgment of
the ancient Church of Christ is so fully repugnant thereunto, that Erasmus

2 This former doctrine of Transubstantiation has begotten another yongling,
which they call C^nc. Trid. Sess. 3.
concomitancie: wherein is taught, that a man in eating the one part, which is
the bread, betokening Christ his body, does consequently drink his blood,
which is signified by the wine: as though herein the Communicant received not
only (which may be confessed) totum Christum, but even totum Christi. But
their other Author yields unto us the consent of See above Cap. 16. Sect. 3.
innumerable ancient writers both Greek and Latin, who practiced the
administration of the Eucharist both in bread and wine, unto the people: and
among other their inducements hereunto, they did allege the Tum quia in
Sacrame^to sanguinis peculiarem quandam virtutem and gratiam hoc vini symbolo
significatam esse credebant: tum obrationes mysticas huius instituti, quae a
veteribus vary adducuntur, viz. ad repraesenta^dum memoriam passionis Christi
in oblatione corporis, and estusione sanguinis, iuxta illud Pauli,
Quotiescunque, etc. -- Item, ad significa^dam integram refectionem sieve
nutritionem, quae cibo and po^^ constat, quomodo Christus inquit, Caro mea
verus est cibus, and sanguis meus verus est potus, etc. Item ad designandam
redemptionem, and tuitionem corpons and animae, vt corpus pro salute corporis,
and sanguis pro salute animae, quae in sanguine est, dari intelligatur; ad
significandum quoque Christum vtramque naturam assumpsisse, corporis, viz. and
animae, vt vtramque redimeret. Cassander Consult. Art. 22.
mystical significations of these two elements. 1. in expressing the memory of
Christ's passion, in the crucifying of his body and in the effusion of his
blood. 2. In betokening man's perfect refection and nourishment, which
consists not only in ^ating his body, but also in drinking of his blood
shed for man's redemption. Whereby we (notwithstanding the opposite
interpretations) may collect this meaning of Antiquity, viz. that the real
things which are received, are to be expounded by the symbols and signs of
receiving: but the sacramental manner of administration does express the
separation of Christ's body crucified, from the blood which was shed; and our
distinct manner of eating and drinking, does explicate the two parts of our
spiritual refection in his body and blood: so that the doctrine of
concomitancy confounding these distinct signs and objects of the Eucharist,
may seem to contradict the judgment of innumerable ancients. Finally, our
Doctor has painted out Aquinas (who lived about the year 1300.) for the Sea

the withholding the cup from the people in the administration of the
Eucharist: which we take to be contrary to the example of Christ, and
primitive antiquity. And although our Adversary Ecchius would not remember
that this has been at any time changed in the Roman Church, yet is he
therefore Nequeo satis mirari Iohannem Ecchium, virum al^oqui insigni memoria

the further See the testimonies following.

before the Council of Constance, as their Jesuits See ibid.

Cassander have affirmed. Thus have we the continuance of that custom, for
which we plead, during the space of more than 1000 years: and can they
require a more notable Innovation than this?

4 Notwithstanding, that we may furthermore discern what little grace the
primitive antiquity can find among our Adversaries, we only require them to
deliver their meaning, as they shall be cited to answer. First, their Bishops
of the Council of Constance, opposing the latter custom unto the former;
Licet in primitiua Ecclesia huiusmodi Sacramentum reciperetur a fidelibus sub
vtiaque specie, postea a conficientibus sub vtraque, and a Lacis tantummodo sub
specie panis suscipiatur, -- etc. Then opp^sing the contrary custom: Vnde
huiusmodi consuetudo ab Ecclesia and sanctis Patribus rationabiliter introducta
and diutissime ob^etuata, sit habenda pro lege. quam non licet reprobare, aut
sine Ecclesiae authoritate pro libito mutare -- Sub poena exommunicationis, vt
effectualiter puniant eos qui communicando populum sub vtraque specie panis and
vini, exho^tati fuerint, and sic faciendum esse docuerint. Conc. Constant Sess.
13.
Although (say they) both kinds were received in the primitive Church, yet
afterward the custom of only one kind came in, which is now to be kept for a
law, upon pain of excommunication against all them, who shall teach or
practice the contrary. And their Fathers of the Council of Trent, Etsi
Christus Dominus in vltima Coena venerabile hoc Sacramentum in panis and vini
speciebus instituit, and Apostolis tradidit: non tamen illa institutio and
traditio eo tendunt, vt omnes Christi fideles statuto Domini ad vtramque
speciem accipiendam astringantur. Conc. Trid. Sess. 21. cap. 1. page 122.
Although (say they) Christ delivered both kinds unto his disciples, yet did he
not give any commandment that all the faithful should be likewise partakers
of both. And Si quis dixe^t sanctam Ecclesiam Catholicam non justice causis and
rationibus adductam fuisse vt Laicos atque etiam Clericos non proficientes sub
panis tantummodo specie communicaret, aut in eo errasse, Anathema sit. Ibid.
Sess. 21. cap. 2.
if any shall say, that the Catholic (meaning the Roman) Church has not
altered this custom upon just causes, let him be Anathema.

5 Shall we be so bold with our Adversaries as to make known their just
causes? One is (as they pretend,) Christus institui: quide^ sub duplici specie,
sed non iussit da^i omnibus sub duplici. Ecclesia vetus ministrabat sub duplici
specie, quando Christiani erant pauci, and praetetea non omnes accipiebant
vtramque speciem: -- erescente autem multitudine, magis ac magis apparuit
incommodum, ac paulatim desijt vsus sub vtraque. Bellar. lib. 4. de Euch. cap.
24.. Neque.
because in the ancient Church Christians were not many, but as the number of
professors did increase, so by the experience of inconuemences, that ancient
custom did by little and little decrease. The second, Mouit and quidem
vehementer irreuerentia and profanationes tanti Sacramenti, quae vix euitari
possent in tanta multitudine, etc.] Bellar. ibid. cap. 28. in fine. In
primitiua Ecclesia sub duplici specie dabatur, modo sub vnica, propter
periculum effusionis sanguinis. Lyranu^ in 1. Cor. 11.
because of reverence, lest that by spilling something, the Sacrament might be
profaned: the third, Tertium incom modum est, quod multi abho^re^t a vino.
Bellar. quo supra, cap. 24.. Tertiu^.
because many detest wine: the fourth, Quartum est penuria vini, siquidem in
multis reg^onibus vinu^ non crescit. Ibid. Quartum.
because in many places there is want of wine: the fifth, Mouit vniformitas and
concordia populi Christi^ni -- nam q^i vinum non ferunt, vt abstemij, aut alij
q^i comparare vinum non possunt, cogerentur nunquam aut ratissime communicare.
Bellar ibid. cap. 28.. Tertio.
because this begets an uniformity in the Church with persons abstemious,
and with those that want wine: the sixth, Esset periculum in falsae credulitatis
inductione -- primo quod tanta esset dignitas Laicorum circa sumptionem
corporis Christi, sicut Sacerd^tum. Gerson contra haeres. com. sub vtraquesp.
Tom. 1. number. 17. apud Hospinian.
because otherwise the Laity partaking both kinds might seem to be equalled in
dignity with the Clergy: the seventh, Quia videret eam ab haereticis ex errore
oppugnari: -- qui negabant concomitantiam. Bellar. quo supra.. Secundo.
because by this the opinion of concomitancie is maintained: the 8. (these two
last serve rather for maintaining of that custom now altered) Ratio sumi potest
ex consensu and testimonio Ecclesiae posteriotis; nam constat ab annis plus
octingentis fuisse vsum in quibusdam Ecclesijs Communionis sub vna specie,
etiam in publico coetu fidelium. Bellar. lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 24.. Quinta
ratio. Primo mouit Ecclesiam consuetudo iam recepta consensu gentium. Ibid.
cap. 28.. Iam.
because of the continuance of the custom of one kind in diverse Churches now
for the space of 800 years: the 9. Deinde, si latam legem quam plurimis retro
annis consuetudo iucundissimam effecerat, nulla euidenti necessitate
conuellatis, Patres; suspica^i multis in mentem veniet, aut vos illam temere
nullo consilio tulisse olim, suscepisseque, aut susceptam cum ratione, and
seruatam diutiss^^e in Christiana republ. nulla vel causa, vel ratione pro
nihilo ducere: quo nihil fingi potest grauitate vestra, aut huius amplissimi
ordinis maiestate magis indignum. Gaspar Cardillo Orat. ad SS. Synod. Trident.
habita, anno 1562, as he is set down by the first Gallobelgicus Tom. 2. lib.
7. page 113.
because if the law made against ministering in both kinds should be altered,
some men would think that the Church had erred in her constitution.

6 What shall we say to these arguments? what? Nothing else, but that so many
reasons are but so many reproaches against the wisdom of reverend Antiquity:
the first; as though there had not been many Christian communicants in the
primitive Church, when notwithstanding Tertullian even in the days of extreme
persecution, durst boast (against the tyranny of infidels) of the innumerable
number of visible and constant Christians, saying, Externi sumus, and vestra
omnia impleuimus, vrbes, insulas, etc. Tertull. Apolog.
We fill your Cities and Isles, etc. How much more were the stars of this
firmament (the Church of Christ) in the peace thereof, whilst the most of
Afric, Asia, and Europe were professors of the faith? To the second, as
though the reverend, martyred, and Apostolical age wanted reverence due unto
Christ his institution. To the 3. 4. and 5. as though those former times for
600 years, and many thousand places of many thousand miles distance, should
differ from these latter ages in natural taste and use of wine. To the sixth; as
though in this Christian communion there were any respect of persons with God,
to esteem the Clergy more worthy herein tha^ the Laity: the ancient Fathers do
admit Est autem vbi nihil differt Sacerdos a subdito, vt quando fruendum est
horrendis mysterijs: similiter enim omnes, vt illa percipiamus, digni habemur.
Non sicut in veteri lege, partem quidem Sacerdos comedebat, partem autem
populus, and non licebat populo participem esse eorum, quorum particeps erat
Sacerdos: sed nunc non sic, verum omnibus vnum corpu^ proponitur, and poculum
vnum. Chrysostom. homil. 18. in 2. Cor. 8. Tom. 4. Tremendus hic calix pati
cunctis condition est traditus. Theoph in 1. Cor. 11. in verba, [Hoc facite.]
no difference between the Priest and the people in participating of this
Sacrament. To the 7. as though one error were to be supported with another. To
the 8. as though (this is the hinge of the whole cause) a new custom were to
be preferred before the old and Apostolical; and the consent of the now Roman
Church, which is but a part of Christendom, before the general consent of the
Greek and Roman Churches of former times: or the continuance of the new
custom in some Churches for 800 years, before the endurance of the primitive
and general custom for the space of more than a thousand: eue^ in Romish
countries, and in the Sea above lib. 1. cap. 12. Sect. 2. f.
Greek Church until this day. To the ninth; as though they might err, lest
they should seem to have erred.

7 Yet lest any may think, that in this last part we beg a principle, imputing
an error unto that custom, which cannot be proved; we are willing to refer
our selves unto our readers judgment, maturated and rectified by observations
arising out of the judgment of Popes, and our Adversaries own confessions.

8 When the Manichees did heretically believe that there was an evil spirit in
wine, and did therefore abstain from receiving the cup, Pope Leo (Anno 450)
noted this practice for Sanguinem redemptionis nostrae omnino haurire

sacrilegious: and Pope Gelasius condemning such communicants, said, Comperimus
quo d^m, ^umpto tantum corporis sacri portione, a Calice sacrati cruoris
abstineant, qui proculdubio (quoniam nescio qua superstitione docentur
astringi) aut integra Sacramenta ac^ipiant, aut ab integris arceantur: quia

not only the Priests, but also ^th^r communicants, as may be colle^ted out of
Bellarm. lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 26.
Either let them take the whole and perfect Sacraments, or let the^ receive no
part at all; for without great sacrilege they cannot be divided.

9 Yea and their Schoolmen did not spare to say, that In primitiua Ecclesia
omnes qui celebrationi Missarum intererant, singulis diebus communicare
solebant, eo quod Apostoli omnes de Cali^e biberunt, Domino dicente, Bibite ex
hoc omnes. Durandus in Ration. lib. 4. cap. 53. page 381.
in the primitive Church, all present at the Communion did participate of the
cup, because, at the first institution, all the Apostles did so, by the
commandment of Christ, saying, Drink you all of this: which use was practiced
in the assemblies under the Apostles, of Omnes sine distinctione, Act. 10. In
verita^e comperi, quia non est acceptor personarum Deus. Brel. in Can. Lect.
52. apud Hospinian.
all, without distinction, because there is no respect of persons with God:
that Qui solam hostiam recipit, non plenum sacramentaliter recipit Sacramentum.
-- Etsi enim in hostia consecrata Christi sanguis fit, non tamen est ibi

significat, non corpus. Durandus lib. 4. cap. 55. test Hospinian, hist.
Sacrament lib. 4. page 374. Licet, inquit, illa sumptio, quae est in accipiendo

the receiving in one kind only, wants the perfection of a sacramental
receiving, wherein Christ's blood is not sacramentally taken: and is of less
worthiness than the other, both in regard of faith, and manner of receiving:
seeming to be so requisite unto the Bohemians, that Testatur Alexander de

religious men (about the year 1230) did instantly desiere it: that after the
Council of Constance (which Alexander Halensis obijt Anno 1245. Posseuinus

was Anno 1414) the Bohemians spared not their best blood in defense of this
Sacrament of Christ his blood: that in the Council of Trent (about the year
1562) it was countenanced by the Dum mayor eruditorum Episcoporum, eaque potior

affected and approved by (as they will be called) the most godly and learned
Catholics.

10 So that if the Apologists require of us notes of resistance against this so
notorious alteration, they may be satisfied to know that this was sufficiently
oppugned by their own Popes, who called the receiving of this Sacrament in
only one kind a Speaking against the Manichees manner of communicating, who were
not Priests, but of the La^ks; and so ^^med it not in respect of their opinion,
which he would have called Heretical, but in respect of violating the
Sacramental institution, and therefore named it Sacraledge.
sacrilegious division. Secondly, by the religious in the days of Alensis.
Thirdly, by the Bohemians, suffering persecution in that behalf. Fourthly, by
the greater part of Bishops in the Council of Trent. Fifthly, by the contrary
wishes and desires of many learned and godly. Lastly by the continued ancient
custom of the Graecians unto this day. And all this by all these;
notwithstanding the Romish pretense of inconveniences for patronizing their
confessed Innovation and change.

11 We have yet reserved to this last place, one memorable answer of their
Cardinal Cusanus, thereby to show the desperateness of their cause. He being
urged with the commandment of Christ in defense of the ancient and necessary
use of both kinds, does thus euade; Dicesfortassis: Ecclesia hodierna non ita
ambulat in ritu co^munionis, sicut ante ista tempora, quando sanctissimi viri
vtriusque speciei Sacramentu^ necessarium esse vi p^aecepti Christi, and verbo
and opere astruebant. Potuit ne t^nc Ecclesia errare? Certe non; quodsi non,
quomodo id hodie verum non est, quod tunc omnium opinione affirmabatur, cum non
sit alia Ecclesia ista, quim illa? Cert^ hoc te non moueat quod diuersis
temporibus alius and ali^s ritus Sacrific^orum, and etiam Sacramentorum stante

intellectas, ita vt vno tempore secun dum currentem vniuersalem ritum
exponerentur; mutato ritu, iterum sententia mutaretur. Card. Cusanus Epist. 2
de vsu Commun. ad Bohemos, page 833.
Scriptures (says he) according unto their diverse occasions of times, are to
admit diverse constructions: as though later times could countermaund the

patronage for all kind of Innouations than this? Whereunto it will be sufficient
for this time to oppose the judgment of their own Lorichius, who in the zeal
which he had to the commandment of Christ, saying, Drink you all of this,
does call all them Ge^a^dus Lorichius, suae factionis acerrimus, and

I do think (says their Jesuit) that Christ in his administration of the
Sacrament, put not the bread into the Disciples mouths, but every one took a
part of the bread out of the dish with his own hands. But this custom was
long after altered, when their Church ordained that men, for reverence, should
not take the Sacrament with their naked hands.

13 Another alteration crept into the Romish Service, grounded perchance upon
the same opinion of reverence, viz. the forbearing to break the bread unto the
people: for in the primitive Church, Addit (Apostolu^) [Panis quem frangimus:]
In quo alludit ad appellationem, qu^ dicitur fractio panis, Luc. 24. Act. 2.
and 20. Nam olim ex pane vno sua cuique particula frangi consueuerat, quo
melius omnium in vnum Christi corpus adunatio repraesentaretur. Salmeron Ies.
in 1. Cor. 10. Disp. 17. page 138.
the bread used to be broken (says their Jesuit Salmeron,) and to be
distributed apart unto the people out of the same lofe, that the communion of
all (Christians) in one mystical body might thereby be better represented.
What wisdom shall we call this, which alters that custom, which the
ancient primitive Church held (as from the Namely 600. years after Christ, as
appears by the Council of Constantinople, which was Anno 681.

institution of Christ) for the better? Well had it bin that as they changed
glassen cups into silver and gold, they had not also (which saying was once
applied unto Bonifacius Martyr and Episcopus, interrogatus si liceret in vasis
ligneis Sacramenta conficere, respondit: quondam sacerdotes aurei ligneis

Priests) changed golden religion into earthen superstition. For so may we
esteem of theirfore said Innovation, whereby the substantial being of bread
is changed into a transubstantiall being of flesh; a distinct separation into a
confusion; a whole communion into an half; hands into mouths, and the custom
of breaking of bread unto the people, disanulled; as if by these alterations
they had meant to put Antiquity unto silence.

CHAP. XXIII.
Of other confessed Romish Innouations in their supposed Sacrifice, Elevation,
private Mass, and Murmuration; besides the abuses of the Sacrament by
purgation of Innocence, and the superstitious end of Reservation.
SECT. 1.
AMong other novelties in this case, our Adversaries have condescended to
think, that the Sea above lib. 2 cap. 7. Sect. 11. And Antiquity used a
taking of the Sacrament, and showing it unto the people, but not by the Romish
Elevation.
Elevation of the host (as it it now used in the Church of Rome either, before
or after consecration) cannot be proved to have been instituted by Christ in
his last supper: nor that Christ did offer therein either See ibid.
a Sacrifice properly propitiatory, yea or a proper Sacrifice of his corporal
presence. Which example of Christ being the archetypon of all Catholic
antiquity, may be our ward against our Adversaries exceptions to the contrary:
according unto the practice of their Cardinal Bellarmine, who rejected some
points in old Liturgies, which carried in them a color of antiquity, even See
above lib. 1. cap. 10. Sect. 2.
because they were not warrantable either by the precept, or example of Christ.
We leave unto their own Author the complaint of little wafers and their new
form, Has Sacerdotum oblatas, quae nunc ad imaginem number morum, and ad
tenuissimam quandam, and leuissimam formam, a very panis specie alienissimam,

Cassander in Liturg. fol. 66. Test Hospiniano de re Sacram. lib. 4. page 371.
which scarce deserve the name of bread, that we may more pertinently insist
upon a more intolerable Innovation.

2 Whilst as the Romish Priest does appropriate the cup unto himself, and
secludeth Christian people from it, his sacramental communion (as has been
confessed) is but an half administration: but when moreover he uses that,
which they call a private Mass, Missa priuata dicitur aliquando quae sit,
nimirum, in loco priuato, licet alia in significatione ea dicitur, in qua solus
(Sacerdos) celebrans communicate. Lorinus Ies. in Act. 2. 46.
wherein (as their Jesuit describes it) the Priest alone does participate the
Sacrament, this turns the communion into no communion at all. And herein
their Priesthood (we think) does contradict the rule of priestly And the Lord
said, Who is a faithful steward and wise, whom the master shall make ruler
over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season. Luc. 12.
42.
stewardship, whereby the Minister is appointed to give unto Christ his family
their due portion. Against this kind of violation of the Sacrament, Antiquity
has cried aloud from the mouths of our Romish Adversaries themselves. One,

Christ (says he) did institute it in a communion, and so it was wont to be

The joint communion with the people (says he) is notoriously known to have

Test Cassandro Consu^t. art. 24. page 216. 217.
They only (says he) are to be present at the Mass, who do communicate,
otherwise it is not to be called a communion. A fourth, ^t hunc ^uisse antiquum

Ecclesiam reuocetur, laborandum. Test eod^m, verbis seqq.
The thing it self speaks, that not only Priests, but Deacons, and common
people used anciently to communicate together both in the Greek and Latin
Church; and how this is ceased (says he) it is to be marvelled. But why
should any marvel hereat? for their Cochlaeus does tell us, that Cochlaeus de
Sacrificio Missae. Quod, inquit, olim tam frequentes non fuerint Misae, inde
accidisse arbitror, quod olim omnes tum Sacerdotes, tum Laici quicunque
intererant sacrificio Missae, peracta oblatione, cum sacrificante

Ecclesiae Doctorum perspicue cognoscitur. -- Tum adiungit: Nunc vero postquam
Communionis ordo a nobis obseruari desijt, idque propter negligentiam atque
socordiam tam plebis quam Sacerdotum, Spiritus sanctus Missas priuatas

Sacram. page 330. 331.
where as anciently, as appears both by the Apostolical Canons, and the
ancient writings of the Doctors of the Church, all the Priests and people
present at the Sacrifice, did communicate together: yet since this order
ceased through the negligence and slothfulness both of Priests and people.

3 No marvel then if even among the Romanists some can do no less then with a
reformation herein: See above at the letter, h. in the margent.
Well it were, (says Hoffmeisteius) and we ought to endeavor it, that some
remedy might be had. But Rome once erring (which is the bottomless pit of
error) will not turn her neck aside to see her own error, and to
acknowledge it. Which consideration, perhaps, caused their Cassander to wish a
reformation with despair, saying, that Cassander.
it may rather be wished, than hoped for: albeit their own Doctors have not
doubted to judge our now Protestant custom the Gene^ aliter est dicendum, quod
illa est legitima Missa, in qua sunt Sacerdos, respondens, off^rens, atque
communicans, sicut ipsa precum compositio euidenti ratione demonstrat. Durandus

most legitimate.

4 Nay, although all Scriptures were silent, and ancient writings dumb, yet
the very Canon of the now Romish Mass does daily put Rome in mind of her
error herein: for, Dubium non est, quin vna cum ipso Sacerdote aliqui
adfue^^nt, qui haec sacrificia laudis offerebant, and Sacramentum
participa^^ant: Id enim Canonis verba manifest significant, vt cum dicitur,
Quotquot ex hac altaris participatione sacrosanctum corpus and sanguinem filij
tui sumpserimus; Item, Prosint nobis, Domine, Sacramenta quae sumpsimus: Certe
ex tota Canoms compositione manifest apparet, totam illam mysticam, in qua
Canon adhibebatur, actionem vel publicam, vel certe inter plures semper
celebratam fuisse. Quod si hodie quoque impetrari impetrari queat, facile verus
eius intellectus restitui possit. -- Cassander Consult. art. 24.. De
iteratione, page 223. Ex Canone quodam Concilij Naneten. sis Saccerdos solus

huic Council. Nanetensis Decreto simile reperitur in Conc. Papiensi, cap. 132 vt

the words of the Canon are manifest (says their learned Consulter) as where
it is said of the Priest, Quotquot etc. As many of us as have been partakers
etc. and again, Bless, O Lord, these Sacraments unto us, which we have
received. Afterward he alleges a Canon of a Council forbidding that any
Priest should say Mass alone, because it is an absurdity for a Priest to say
thus [The Lord be with you,] or, [Let us give thanks unto thee, o Lord,] when
there was none to make answer: so that the Cur autem Canon noster alijs in
superstitionem, alijs in contemptum adductus sit, in causa potissimum est

Cassander Consult. art. 24. page 222.
alteration of the ancient order has caused some to contemue their (Romish)
Canon of the Mass.

5 Here again the importunate challenge of the Romish Apologists becomes
ridiculous, whilst as they exact in all changes, in matters of moment, a
demonstration of the certain Times, Authors, and Resisters of such
Innouations, or else will not have it imagined that Rome is degenerated from
her self. Is not here a confessed matter of moment, the celebratio^ of a
Sacrament? Is there not a notable change, a communion into no communion? shall
we not judge it heinous, which their own Authors cannot but deplore? must it
not be called notorious, which their own Canon does daily contradict? Yet in
this most certain change what greater uncertainty of the direct time, and
inuenters, than when our Adversaries in showing the cause why it crept into the
Church, are compelled to marvel at the manner, how?

6 Unto the former novelties we add two other, to make up this mess more
full, even the Romish fashion of Si quis dixerit Ritum Romanae Ecclesiae, qua
submissa voce -- veiba consecrationis profe^untur, damnandum esse, -- Anathema
sit. Conc. Trid. Sess 22 cap. 9. can. 9.
reciting the words of consecration in a secret and vnaudible voice; which
custom their late Council of Trent will not have reproved upon danger of an
Anathematization: but without just cause, if we will be zealous imitators of
antiquity, rather tha^ superstitious innouators and inuenters of novelties: For
their Cardinal Bellarmine, howsoever he seek to paraphrase upon the point,
yet does he grant, that Respondeo, Christi etc. but is contented to grant, that
Christus ita loquebatur, vt ab Apostolis audiretur. Bellar. lib. 2. de M^ssa,
ca. 12. Respondeo Christ's.
Christ uttered the words of consecration with an audible voice. Their Jesuit
Salmero^ grants, that Certe si Liturgias ^raeco^um consulas, inuenies tam in
Missa ^acobi Apostoli, and Clementis Romans quam in illis quae aeditae sunt a
Basilio, and Chry ^ostomo* quod vbi Sacerdos protulisset alta voce verba
consecrationis, tam post panis, quam post vini consecrationem, populus
acclamabat, dicendo Amen. Idem etiam confirmatur ex Leone, Augustino, Ambrosio,
and alijs multis Patribus. Salmeron Ies. com in 1. Cor. 14 disp. 22. His igitur.
in the Missals of S. James, Clement, Basil (if we shall suppose these to have
been the authors of such Missals) and in the judgment of Pope Leo, Augustine,
Ambrose, and other Fathers, the words of consecration were to be spoken with a
loud voice.

7 This consent of antiquity may well warrant us to neglect the Romish
Anathema, and rather submit our selves unto the equity of the Imperial law of
Iustini^n, who Iubemus vt omnes Episcopi and Presbyteri non tacito modo, sed
clara voce, quae a populo exaudiatur, sacram oblationem celebrent, quo maiori
deuotione in depromendis Domini Dei laudibus audientium animi esterantur. Et

relinquemusque. Iustiman Imperat. Novel. Constit. 123. Extra. 123. Test
Hospin. Just. Sacram. page 169.
commanded all Bishops and Priests, in the administration of the Sacrament to
deliver the words audibly, knowing that they are to give an account of all
these things before the dreadful judgment seat of Christ Jesus. Therefore
may it not be thought to be a matter of small moment, being so plain a
derogation from the institution of Christ, by the innovation of Vigilius

sacrificia in altari consecrata, voce submissa. Test Hospin. l. 2. Hist. Sacr.

8 The second concerns the lawful use of this Sacrament, which is the
remembrance of Christ his death: nevertheless (about the year 870.) Si te

from the imputation of adultery: and ordained that in Monasteries, where there
was a question of theft, Saepe contingit vt in Monasterijs Monachor^ furta

those decrees (says their Aquinas) were abrogated by other Popes.

9 Here the Romish Apologists may obseruea Pope innouating, and (this being in
a matter of divine nature) notoriously. If they reply, that this notorious
Innovation found a notable resistance, this we say is most true, it was
resisted by contrary decrees of their own Popes: but when? The decrees show,
that it was not until long after: which argues the friuolousnesse of their
objection from See above.
resistance. Yet how shall we think all this profaneness fully abolished,
whilst as their disciples take that Sacrament of the remembrance of Christ his

pledge and bond unto themselves in their bloody Their Conspirators in the

Schoolmen has further observed) Gabriel Biel in Can. Lect. 36. -- Manducatio,

fructus huius Sacramenti participes fieri, postquam corpus suum consecrauit,

conseruarent, sed dedit in sui vsum, dicens, Accipite and manducate. Et quoniam

the eating and drinking of the Sacrament is the use thereof; therefore Christ,
when he had consecrated it, he did furthermore give it unto his Disciples, not
that they should honorably reserve it, but that they should by eating it, be
made partakers of the fruit thereof. We proceed to speak

dismission of the non-communicants, and not suffering them to be present at
the celebration of these Sacraments: so that where this dismission and
exception is not (as indeed it is not found in the Romish Mass,) there (says
their own Author) that which we call Mass is not so rightly performed, as to
deserve the proper name of Mass.

12 Neither does it beseem the Romanists to exact of us a remonstrance of the
definite beginnings of all changes, who being demanded to express from what
Authors the diverse alterations of the Canons of their Mass had their
beginnings, Quis vero fuerit author huius Canonis, vel praecepti, recitandi

Missals ascribed unto S. Ambrose, and S. Gregory, for to know whether form
should be rather admitted universally in the Church: they put the trial hereof
unto a miracle, intending to prefer that which God by some revelation should
rather approve. To this end they c lay them upon the altar, lock the doors,
and expect some visible token of discerning them, from God. In the morning
behold S. Ambroses lies on the table, as they left it, but S. Gregory's is
found dissolved into parts, which were here and there scattered: whereby they
were instructed from God (says their Author,) that the Missall of S. Ambrose
was to be used only in his Church, but the other of S. Gregory was to be
dispersed and exercised throughout the world.

14 This Legend we have propounded, not in an opinion of the truth thereof, but
to notify how prone our Adversaries are to prefer that which is the less
ancient, and that also upon a silly conceit; because, forsooth, it was found
dissolved and dispersed: which by the Scripture phrase should have rather
persuaded them that God did reject it as abominable, according as it is
written, Deuteronomy. 28. Disperget eum Deus. and Psalm. 88. Disperget inimicos. and
Psalm. 91. Dispergentur, qui operantur iniquitatem.
Disperse and scatter mine enemies, o Lord, etc.

15 But be their form of Mass and Liturgy old or new, call they it as they
please, Ambrosian or Gregorian (the latter whereof is confessed to have been in
Gregory his time, See above lib. 1. cap. 3. Sect. 1.
a newly invented form of Service:) yet if all their Missals be altogether
godly and consonant unto true antiquity, we are bound to allow and justify
them: contrarily if they be fraught with impieties, they themselves ought as
well to detest them. Hear we then their own Romanists, not of obscure or
neglected note, but of public and eminent approbation in their Church.

their solemn worship: but can the Apologists tell when, and how they crept in,
or by whom then they were presently resisted? If they can show us a due
resistance, how then have they remained in their Liturgies? If they cannot
demonstrate these changes accordingly, then are they but unequal disputants,
who prescribe unto others rules and properties of change, which they will not
acknowledge, when they are objected against themselves. e Quodsi nostra

for the Romanists, who have attributed unto the natural man an indifferent
power of consenting or dissenting unto good, they have been repulsed by the
positions of their own Doctors, which teach from the judgment of ancient
Fathers: first, that there is a See above lib. 1 cap. 10. Sect. 9. lit. e. in

lit. a. in marg.
will is not the principal agent in the act of consent unto good, because it
is but an instrument of grace. Thirdly, that grace does determinate the will.

2 In this cause we hold it furthermore very obseruable, which their Jesuit
Salmeron has commendably published to the confutation of infidelity. The
first argument (says he) for proof of a true Church, is, that it performs a
more inviolable worship, and that it does more depresse the pride of man's
nature, yielding less unto his natural power. Now whether this note may not
justify Protestants, in respect of the Romanists, as it does the Romanists, in
comparison of infidels (although not in an equal degree,) the wisdom of our
Christian Reader will easily discern by this controversy concerning Free Will.

3 From their opinion of Free Will their doctrine of Merit has had an
original: both that which they call de congruo, which many of their own
teachers have termed a See above lib. 3 cap. 9. Sect. 3.
new invention, and contrary unto the judgment of ancient Doctors; as also
the other, which they name de condigno, which their learned Schoolmen, as
namely, Waldensis and Pigghius, together with diverse other principal Readers
in their Schools, have judged to be See above lib. 2 ca. 11. Sect. 8.
no universal or Catholic, and consequently no ancient doctrine.

4 An other principal question there is concerning sola fides, that is, faith
only justifies; whereby is not signified, that faith is alone in a justified
man (for a justifying faith Galat. 5. 6.
works by love;) but that it is the only gift of grace, which is ordained as
the hand of the regenerate soul, to apprehend and apply the remission of
sins, by the virtue of Christ his passion, whereby only a sinner is
justified before Gods tribunal. Hereof Erasmus has truly thus affirmed: Haec
vox [Sola] tot clamoribus lapidata hoc seculo in Luthero, reuerenter legitur
and auditur in Patribus, Erasmus, as he is cited by Lubbertus de Eccles. lib.
5. cap. 2. page 247.
Sola fides, which (says he) is stoned to death in Luther, (meaning, by the
Romanists) is reverently heard and received from the ancient Fathers.
Doubtless; for if they had a due and reverend esteem of the sense of the
Fathers in their sola fides, they could not be so censorious, as to command in
the Protestants In the Indices of Chrysostom and diverse other Fathers. See all
their Indices Expurg.
Indices of the books of ancient Fathers, the very term of sola fides to be
blotted out: who may be confuted by that form of confession, which Anselme
(who lived Anno 1096) is supposed to have prescribed unto all sick men, as the
only cordial, and (that we may so call it) the extreme unction at the hour of
death, teaching the sick party to resolve Inuenio ego librum quenda^ in

CHAP. XXV.
Of other confessed Romish Innouations, as namely, in their doctrine of
Purgatory, Indulgences, Jubilees, virtue of Holy Water, and necessity of
auricular Confession.
SECT. 1.
WE shall need but only to point at their Innovation in their article of
belief concerning Romish Purgatory, because it has been already handled at
large: where our Adversaries themselves have observed a See above lib. 1 cap 2.
Sect. 14.
none, or very rare mention thereof in the Greek Fathers: a no general
apprehension thereof, at the first, in the Latin Church: a no profession of
that doctrine in the Greek Church unto this day: but to have crept into credit
by little and little. Can they possibly avouch that doctrine to be ancient,
which was not taught at the first? or Catholic, which sometime was not
universally believed in the Church of Christ? or true, which is discerned to be
but a creeper into their Creed?

2 Seeing then that their article of Purgatory is but of so young faith, their
doctrine of Indulgences, questionless, cannot be old: because (as their Bishop
Roffensis has rightly observed) See above lib. 1 cap. 2. Sect 20.
until men had a while trembled at the understanding of a fiery Purgatory,
Indulgences did not come into use, whereof (says he) we have nothing expressly
set down either in Scriptures, or in the writings of ancient Fathers.

3 Yet notwithstanding has their Alphonsus de Castro presumed to reckon the
denial of this doctrine in the catalogue of old heresies, but so as that he
both bewraieth his malady, and betraieth his cause, thus preuaricating in his
plea: Neque tamen hac occasion sunt contemnendae, quod earum vsus in Ecclesia
videatur sero receptus, quoniam multa sunt posterioribus nota, quae vetusti
illi scr^ptores prorsus ignorauerint. -- Qua de causa vsque ad hodiernum diem
Purgatorium non est a Graecis creditu^. Quis tamen, nisi haereticus, haec
negare audebit, quia apud priscos Authors haec sub talibus nominibus non
commemorantur? Ecclesia enim quotidie prosicit in membris suis, Deo came
quotidie magis illustrante. Quapropter Ecclesia comparatur aurorae: Quae est
ista, inquit, quae progreditur quasi aurora? At aurora in suo o^t^ remissum
habet lumen, quod temporis progressu augetur. Sic Ecclesia. Vnde non dubito
quin etiam multa sint a posteris clarius and apertius inuenienda, quae nobis
sunt prorsus nunc ignota. Quid ergo mirum si ad hunc modum contigerit de
Indulgentijs, vt apud priscos nulla sit de eis mentio? praecipue quod tunc
magis feruebat Christanorum, charitas, vt paru^ effect opus Indulgentijs. --
Add quod non est tam recens Indulgentiaru^ vsus, quantum isti hae tetici
exprobra^t. Nam ap^d Romanos vetustissimos praedicatur earu^ vsus, vt ex stat
onibus Romae frequentibus colligi vtcunque potest. Alphonsus de Castro, lib. 8.
aduers here is. Tit. Indulgentiae. fol. 184. His conclusion shows, that he
speaks as well of the use of things, as of their names.
Indulgences (says he) may not therefore be thought worthy of contempt, because
the use of them has been taken up but of late; for posterity understands
many things, which their ancestors never knew: which is the cause why
Purgatory was not believed in the Greek Church unto this day. To this end he
compares the knowledge of the primitive Church unto the light of the gray
morning, which has but a dim shine, and by progress of time waxes clearer.
What is this but a kind of Anabaptisticall infatuation, arrogating to these
last times a greater illumination then was vouchsafed to the primitive Church?

4 And yet again, It is no marvel (says he) though we should find no mention
of Indulgences, especially among the ancients, because their charity was
seruent, and had less need of Indulgences than we, among whom it is become so
cold. Thus much their Castro. By this supposall he has darkened and almost
dammed up the light of antiquity upon a new presumption of a better and
clearer revelation of truth in the twy-light, or rather moon shine of these
later times, and (which argues a greater solecismein divinity) they hereby
persuade men to think, that when charity is less hot, then it pleased God
to send a larger use of Indulgences and pardons; whereby (as has been
confessed) See above lib. 2 cap. 15. Sect. 6.
piety israther exhausted and extinguished, whilst that they are applied both
unto the living and to the dead. Albeit their Hostiensis (whom Cardinal
Bellarmine has surnamed Catholic) feared not to say, that Ex Catholicis
Hostiensis in summa lib. 5. tit. de remission^b. -- docuit, Indulgentias
detunctis non prodesse Bellar. lib. 1. de Indulg. cap. 14.. Quod ad.
Indulgences do not prosite the souls of the departed: and consequently this
doctrine is proved to be erroneous. For See above lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 20.
the first who extended Indulgences unto Purgatory (as has been likewise
confessed) was Pope Boniface the eight, about the year 1300: and then this
cannot but be a notorious Innovation.

5 A sprig of the same branch is Iubtlee, wherein they promise a See the
testimony following.
sull pardon of all sins, unto them who come to visit the Apostolical
monuments at Rome. These are the Iudulgences of Indulgences, yet were they
first appointed by the foresaid Bonifacius 8. praestutit plenam omnium

Pope Sixtus quartus unto cuery twenty and fifth year. All which alterations
(if a man would know the reason of them) smelling of See at the letters, hand,
l.
gain, may well seem, besides the nouclties of them, to be but baits of
impiety. Neither may Holy Water sprincle therefore be called ancient, because
it was first instituted by so ancient a Pope as See above lib. 1. cap. 3. ^ect.
5.
Alexander the first, for the driving away of Devils: but rather because it was
an humane invention, it must go current for a nouelty.

6 Auricular confession, has by the Council of Trent obtained a name of
absolute necessity; and is notwithstanding noted by their own Doctors, See
above lib. 2 cap. 24.

and 4. and lib. 3. ca. 12 Sect. 2.
nor of dtuine institution: not of common p^aclise in the primitive Church, nor
acknowledged among the Grecians: but to be stuffed with deuterosia^s (that is,
new rules) of impossibilities: and therefore the doctrine of the necessity of
this kind of consession, may justly be enrolled among the pernicious
Innouations.

7 See above lib. 2 cap. 12.
Invocation of Saints departed (to rest still upon our Adversaries confessions)
was no usual manner of worship in the old Testament among the Jews: Ibidem.
nor yet practiced among Christians in the beginning of the primitive Church.
Now because the good Steward is commended in the Gospel, because he Matthew. 13.

according to the exposition of Fathers, Noua and vetera sunt veutus and nouum
Testamentum. Aquinas ex August. Chrysostom. Hilar. Hiero^. in Catend.
the old and new Testaments: this point also may challenge the title of an
Innovation.

8 Canonization of new Saints, which are to be inuocated, our Adversaries have
appropriated unto the office of the Sea above lib. 2. cap. 12. Sect. 7.
Pope: in the which function if their Pope may possibly be deceived, Ibidem.
then may we (say they) abolish all the worship of those Saints, who have been
canonized in these aftertimes. And Ibidem.
some Catholics (as themselves term them) have calied in question the
certainty of this act of the Pope, because of the evil opinions and works,
which some have defended and practiced, who notwithstanding have been canonized
for Saints. Yea, and the first Pope (to come to the point of antiquity) whom
Cardinal Bellarmine could find to have exercised this act of Canonization of
souls departed, was Ibidem.
Leo the third, who lived about the year 796. And shall not this be an
argument of an Innovation?

9 If we consider the effect of their doctrine of Invocation, do we but
remember what our Adversaries have confessed, even the defiling of the blessed
memory of the holy Virgin and mother of our Lord by Inuocations See above lib 2
cap. 12. Sect. 9, 10, 11, 12.
Idolatrously commended by some of their Doctors, and practiced by their
people: as is here also further Tantum enim haec Sanctorum interpellatio

pleasure, whether an old Paganism, or a new Antichristianisme. After all these
we are to speak

CHAP. XXVI.
Of other confessed new Romish doctrines, concerning the blessed Virgins
natural Conception, and supernatural Assumption, and the feast of Corpus
Christi.
SECT. 1.
WOrthily is the holy Virgin to be proclaimed Iuc. 1. 48.

and in speaking: but yet as she is the mother of Christ the John 14. 6.
truth, so would she be honored only according unto truth, whether we
consider the beginning or end of her life.

2 In her natural conception she was according unto Gods election blessed,
but, as naturally issuing from the tainted mass of Adam, she was not free from
original sin. Which accords with the judgment of antiquity; some of the Sea above lib. 2 cap. 29 Sect. 2. in marg. lit. e.
Romanists themselves mentioning for proof here of fifteen Authors, some 200,
some 300, some all the Fathers; notwithstanding the Council of Basil (Anno
1431) did Nos gloriosam Virginem Dei genetricem Mariam praeueniente and
operante diuini numinis gratia singulari, nunqua^ actualiter subiacuisse
originali peccato, sed immunem semper fuisse ab omni originali and actuali
culpa, sanctamque and immaculatam tanquam piam and consonam c^l^ui

novelty, and the feast (as it did signify the integrity of her natural
conception) he judged to be neither sacred in it self, nor yet consonant unto
the an^ient rite of the Church. Which feast was first received into the Latin
Church (says their Jesuit Suarez) Accedit ab Ecclesia festum Conceptionis
celebrari, qui nios in Ecclesia (...) mill annos est orsus, vt Galatinus
refert. -- In Latina vero introduci coepit ante 500 sere annos, vt ex Epistolis
(...) constat. -- Tandem vero Ecclesia Romans ante 200. annos Celebritatem hanc
generaliter amplexa, cultoribus ^ius ^ingul^^es indulgentias impertit. Vnde
quodammodo videtur conceptionem Virginis canoniz ass. Non est ergo pium
credere Ecclesiam in retanta tamque graui decipi, aut falso fundamento niti.
Suarez. Tom. 2. in 3. Thom. q 27. art 2. disp. 3. Sect. 5. page 24.
some 400 years ago, and about two hundred years since made general, and the
conception of the Virgin, as it were, then canonized. Here again appears a
no Catholic Innovation.

3 Next, as every man has a Genesis, to be conceived and borne into the world,
so has he an Exodus and passage out of this life, according to the law of
mortality: by virtue whereof the blessed Virgin, as she was not privileged
from a natural conception, so was she not freed from death, which is the
passage of all flesh. But the question is, whether after death, her body were
translated into Heaven. The holy Scripture names Christ the 1. Cor. 15. 20.

constantly to profess, that the blessed Virgin was both in body and soul
assumed into heaven, as being a matter proved most true by tradition.

4 We have thought that our Adversaries distinguishing (for so themselves have
affirmed*) Tradition from the word written, had understood by Tradition a
doctrine recorded at least in the writings of some Ancie^ts; yet concerning
this Assumption they confess, that Sed iam caetera, quae ad rei gestae
historiam pertinent, prosequamur: quae quidem, cum neque ex Canonicis
Scr^pturis, neque ex Patrum antiquorum testimonijs roborentur; non omnia, quae
in eo genere sunt scripta, recitabimus. Baron. ibid. number 9.
it is not confirmed either by Canonical Scriptures, or by the writings of
ancient Fathers. Whereof S. August. sermon. 35. de Sanctis. -- Virgo Maria quo

dixi, ita cauentur, vt ad confirmandam rei veritatem ^inim^ legi permittantur.
Hinc sanc pulsantur nonnulli, quia nec corpus eius reperitur in terra, nec
assumptio eius cum carne, vt in Apocrypha legitur, in Catholica reperitur
historia. Sed dignum non est de corporis eius notitia sollicitum quempiam esse,
quam non dubitat super coelo^elatam cum Christo regnare; sed nec inuenitur apud
Latinos aliquis tractatorum, de eius morte quippiam dixisse aperte. Et quid de

Sophronius under his name: Hieronymus, sieve Hieronymi comes Sophronius, in
Sermon. de Assumpt. Virginis, libri huius mentionem faciens, ita scribit: -- Haec

We know not (says he) what to affirm hereof, but leave it unto God. And

Romish Doctors themselves dare go no further then to think it a probable or a
godly opinion, and no more infallible than was the other of her Conception,
which many of the^ have rejected as untrue. So that these two points deserve to
be censured by the name of Innouations: and yet are they both magnified in
their prayers unto God, and this of the Assumption, is the most honored Hoc

of all the feasts which are celebrated unto our Lady.

5 Lastly, the feast called Corpus Christi, wherein they give a solemn
adoration to the host, as unto Christ his own natural body, is confessed to
have been Vrbanus 4. Pontifex anno 1264. instituit sestum illud corporis

for the Cross was instituted (Anno 828,) by Pope Gregory the fourth. Both, we
see, are Innouations, so much the more notorious, as they are more Idolatrously
abused.

CHAP. XXVII.
Other confessed Romish Innouations concerning Images: first in the public
visible Image of the invisible God.
SECT. 1.
BEfore that we entreat of the adoring of God in a picture, we are to enquire
into the picturing of God, to know whether the Church may allow of any visible
Image of the invisible God, in our spiritual worship. Master Calvin has
called this kind of Imagerie Quarta opimo est Caluini, vbi dicit primo, nefas
esse Deo inuisibili and incorporeo imaginem visibilem and corpoream collocare.
Bellar lib. 2. de imag. Sanct. cap. 8. princip.
an heinous wickedness: Haec opinio Caluini est etiam aliquorum Catholicorum,

and ab Ecclesia forte tolerari, non tamen probari. Idem ibid.
Wherein some Catholics (says Cardinal Bellarmine) do consent unto him, who
therefore think that the Church does rather permit, than allow the Images of
God. And Albulensis.
one of these lived an hundred years before Calvin. But was not Calvin
herein a Catholic? If this were to be tried by Scripture, it is plain by the
voice of God, commanding his people not to make any similitude of him: why?
Thou saw no liknesse (says God) but heardst only a voice. Can any man paint
a voice? or shall a body resemble a spirit, or a visible figure notify an
invisible Essence, without a lie? Impossible; which the Cardinal does rightly
observe, calling it Vno modo ad exprimendam persectam similitudinem formae, and
naturae rei ipsius, and hoc modo res corporeae solum (...) -- (...) quis Deum
ha^ rat^one depingere tentaret, is verum idolum constitueret. --
Idolatrous to make an Image with intent to express the perfect nature of God
thereby: and therefore thinks to salve all, by allowing no more in such
Images, but either an Altero modo ad historiam aliquam oculis exhibendam:

2 But we hold it a true Catholicisme, to apply our selves unto more ancient
Fathers, who in their holy jealousy did generally abhor all such outward
similitude of God. Qui (Christiam) Dei, vtpote in cerporei and inuisibilis,

Who is so mad as to think that God can be resembled by the likeness of a

Fools are they and dotards that attempt it, says Athanasius. And, in the
opinion of S. Augustine, Tale (spea^ing of the form of a man) Deo collocare

it is a wickedness; and of Damascene, Summae insipientiae and impietatis est,

it is a madness to set up a figure and Image unto God.

3 These testimonies inform us, and may enforce our Adversaries to believe,
that the general judgment of Antiquity did teach men to reject, or at least
(which their Jesuit Vasquez does think may be See above, lib. 3. cap. 16.
lit. e.
supposed) did not allow the picturing of God, for fear of the peoples
pronenesse unto Idola^^ie. And good reason, for God is best comprehended of us
by thinking him to be incomprehensible. And so much the rather may we be
persuaded thereof, because their Cardinal himself, when he was to justify
the practice of his Church herein, did not throughout the compass of more than
a thousand yea^res, allege any ancient writer for defense of such figurations;
but finding himself destitute of the voice of Origin, Athanasius, Augustine,
Damascene and other Fathers, he made bold to Tertio dico, licere pingere etiam
imaginem Dei Patris in forma hominis senis: and Spiritus sancti in forma
Columbae: vt Caietanus, Ambrosius, Catharinus, Diegus Payua, Nicolaus Sanderus,
Thomas Waldensis. Id vero ita probamus. Bellarm. quo supra.
call in Cardinal Caietane, Catharine, Payua, Sanders, Waldensis, (even his
own brethren) for the only patrons of this cause. Thus much of an Image. Let
us examine the worship of an Image.

The second Innovation, is the worship which they yield unto the Image of
Christ, and unto other Images.
SECT. 2.
4 In the doctrine of the worship of Images, the Romanists are at a cross-way:
some of them will have Prima negat, ita vt iuxta hanc opinionem cultus latriae
in Christum solum in cruce, vel imagine, cogitatione, and recordatione
contentum, tanquam in terminum referstur: Crux vero and imago tantummodo sit
id, in quo aut per quod Christum colimus: vt verum sit dicere, non col^re nos
culru latriae crucem, aut imaginem Christi, sed in cruce, aut imagine ipsum
Christum, cuius similitudinem Crux vel imago refert. Neque huius sententiae
authors inficiantur Crucem and imaginem aliqua veneratione, honor, and cultu
prop^ie esse colendam; cuius terminus proprius sit ipsa Crux and imago in
seipsa, siquidem Crucem and imag. Christi osculamur, amplectu^mar and r^ligiose
contrectamus: sed solum negant Cruci and imagini cultum la^i^ae verae and
propriae, qui per imaginem transit ad exemplar, quod resert, vt ad terminum,
and obiectu^ cultus. Huius sententiae fuisse perhibentur Alex. Durand. Holcoth,
Mirandulanus. -- Gal ^iel, meo igdicio, idem sentit, quod alij primae opinionis

the worship due unto the Image of Christ, to be only that wherein, or whereby
we worship Christ. Secunda opinio affirmat, coli debere adorattone latriae, hoc
est, codem cultu, honor, and veneratione, qua colitur Christus, cuius est

tanquam in obiecto vlti no; in imagine vero repraesentante terminatur, non
propter ipsam, sed propter exempl^r. Azor ibid. Secunda opinio.
Others affirm, that the Image is to be adored with the same divine worship,
wherewith Christ himself is worshipped, whose Image it is: and this they call
Haec sententia communi est Theologorum consensurecepta. Ibid.. Praeterea.
the common opinion of Divines. But how commendable this is, we must examine by
antiquity, first in the prescription of worship, which God himself gave unto
his people under the law: where some Romanists (as namely Sandetus, Cathariaus,
and alij existimant aenaeum serpentem populo propositum suisse, vt aliquis ei
cu^tus deferretur. M. (...). -- Pam^elius putat in veteri lege prohiberi tantum

Ies. lib. 1. de Idol. cap. 5. page 696 col. 2.)
Sanders, Pammelius, and Catharine) do spy (as they think) the Cherubins and
brazen serpent propounded unto the people of the Jews to be worshipped: but
these are confuted by Vetum ex Scriptura constat aeneum serpentem tantum
propositum fuisse aspiciendum, cumque; simplex ille aspectus etiam gratia

Azorius, both Jesuits, who teach, that the pictures and Images then in use,
served for the ornament of the Tabernacle and Temple, but were never applied by
the Jews unto holy worship: producing for the confirmation hereof a whole
inquest of Schoolmen. And if we now demand of these Jesuits, why we should
shake off that yoke of Gods commandment, which the Jews did so long and
religiously sustain, they answer, forsooth, that that commandment of [not
worshipping any Image etc.] Dico praeceptum illud de non adorandis figuris non
fuisse legis naturae, sed tantum positiuum, and ceremomale, and temporale, and

was not natural, but positive, and ceremontall, and therefore at the entrance
of the Gospel was to vanish and cease. Which Gloss their Cardinal Sed haec
opinio nobis non probatur, tum propter argumenta facta contra Iudaeos,
tum-etiam, quia Iren. Tertull. Cyprian. August. docent omne praeceptum (excepto
Sabbato) legem esse naturalem. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 7.. Saed haec.
Bellarmine rejects, as contradicting the judgment of Irenaeus, Tertulliam,
Cyprian, and Augustine, four memorable witnesses of antiquity.

5 But forasmuch as our Adversaries will have us think the law of Jewish
antiquity to be out of date, and do therefore appeal unto the Christian
antiquity under the Gospel, thither will we jointly approach: and for our
better expedition are contented to consult with their own Doctors, who doubt
not to say, that Ad imagines vero Sanctorum quod attinet, certum est, initio
praedicati Euangelij aliquanto tempore inter Christianos, praesertim in
Ecclesijs, imaginum vsum non fuisse, vt ex Clemente and A^nobio pater; tandem
picturas in Ecclesiam admissas, vt retum gestarum historiam exprimentes, aut
Sactorum virorum viuas effigies referentes. Cassander Consult. Art. 21. page
149.
at the first preaching of the Gospel in the days of Clement and Arnobius
(which was about the years 65, and 290) there was no public use of Images in
their Churches. De illorum cultu iam agamus, quem non modo nostrae religionis
expertes, sed, test Hieron. omnes ferme veteres sancti Patres damnabant, ob
metum odololatriae, qua nullum execrabilius scelus esse potest. Polydor.
Virgil. lib. 6. Invent. cap. 13. Which voice their Index Expurg. has put to
silence.
As for the worship of them, S Hierome does witness, that it was condemned
almost of all ancient Fathers. Q^antum autem veteres initio Ecclesiae ab omni
veneratione imaginum abhorruerunt, declarat vnus Origenes aduersus Celsum lib.
7. -- Impossible esse, vt qui Deum nouit, fiat supplex statuis; nec hoc tantum
stultum esse, si quis preces simulachris offerat, sed etiam cum id aliquis
simulat, vulgi opinionibus se attemperans: nil enim adulterum debet esse in
anima hominis vere pij erga Deum. Nos vero ideo quoque non honoramus
simulachra, quia quantum possumus, cauemus, ne quando incidamus in eam
credulitatem, vt and ijs tribuamus diuinitatis aliquid. Cassander Consult. art.
21. page 153.
As appears also by Origin (Anno 230.) esteeming it to be a foolish and an
adulterous profanation, even outwardly to seem to worship a statue: which kind
of worships the Ratio cur prouinciale Conc. Elibertinum in Hispania imagines in
templis eius prouinciae pingi vetuerit, nempe vt Idololatriam hoc remedio
extingueret: nam etsi Patres illius Synodi scirent, sacrarum imaginum cultum
Ecclesiae iam adultae vt. litatem maximam confer, tamen cum animaduertillent
gentes illas nuper ab Idolorum superstione ad Christum venientes, adhuc ad
pristinam idololatriam inclinari, and diuinos honores imaginibus in Ecclesijs
Christianorum depictis impendere, acsi illis inesset aliquod diuinitatis,
iudicarunt praesenti morbo non posse aliter mederi, quam imaginum
interdictione. Sixtus Senens. Biblioth. S. lib. 5. Annot (...) page 420.
Council of Eliberis did forbid (Anno 305) for fear of the peoples idolatry.
Epiphanius also (Anno 390) chancing to see an Image Epiphanius -- velum quoddam
scidit, quod pendere videbat in foribus cuiusdam Ecclesiae, eo quod habebat
imaginem Christi aut alicuius hominis sancti: -- dicitque contra authoritatem
Scripturarum in Ecclesia (...) hominis imaginem pendere. Ecce ad quae tempora
hunc reducemus errorem. Alphonsus de Castro, Haeres. Tit. Imag. initio.
either of Christ or of some Saint, hanging at the door of an Oratory, did cut
it in pieces, holding it to be a thing contrary unto Scripture: and for that
cause is boldly noted by their Alphonsus of error: unto whom (when he is
produced for a witness of the custom of the ancient Church,) their Jesuit
opposes the Quanquam si maxim factum illud exploratum esset, nonne plus
ponderis apud nos Ecclesiae totius authoritas atque vsus habere debet? Greg.
Valen. Ies. lib. 2. de Idol. cap. 7. page 719 col. 1.
authority of the Church of Rome.

6 Again, the now vulgar excuse of such worship was held to be no better than
heathenish in those ancient times, as both Arnobius (Anno 290) and Lactantius
(Anno 320) are observed to give evidence; who report this answer of the Paganes
in excuse of the Idolatrous worship of their Gods, saying, Nec valebat tune
illa ratio, quae a nonnullis obtendi solet, hono^esistos non simulachris, sed
ijs, quorum speciem repraesentant, deferri; haec enim a Paganis quoque adf^rri
solebat, vt apud Arnobium: Non (inquiunt) materias, -- sed eos in his colimus
eolque veneramur, quos dedicatio in^er^ ^^cra. ^t apud Lactantium: Non ipsa
(inquiunt) simulachra timemus, sed eos, ad quorum imaginem ficta, and quoium
nominibus con^ecrata ^unt Cassander Consult. Art. 21. page 153.
We worship not the Images, but the persons, whom the Images do represent.
Neither yet did the age of S. Sane ex Augustino constat, eius aetate
simulachrorum vsum in Ecclesijs n^n fuisse, ex his quae scripsit in Psalm. 114.
ad verse. illum, Simulachra gentium, etc. Cassander ibid page 151.
Augustine (Anno 400) acknowledge the^ as law full in their public use. And
although even in those times (when Paganism was rooted out, and Christianity
confirmed in men's hearts) they Tandem v^^o, qu^ndo exoleto propemodum paganismo
-- animis Christianorum in syncero Dei cultu, satis institutis and confirmatis,
picturae in templis receptae sunt, idque iam tum aetate Ambrosij, etc. Idem

began to be received into the public Churches, for (as we think) an
Emblematicall and historical use: yet (Anno 600) See above lib. 1. cap. 2.
Sect. 25, and 26.
the judgment of the Church of Rome is manifest (as has been confessed) by
the Epistle of S. Gregory, who taught the allowing of them as historical and
sacred monuments only, and forbad the worshipping of them.

7 The Apologists cannot blame us, if here we make the period of our
demonstration of antiquity by descent, where they began to ascend in the
pretense of their ancient hold. This does sufficiently bewray their Innovation
in the public worship of their Church: which we might prove to be as
pernicious in the nature, as it has been new and prodigious in the birth. But
our task in this book is not to prove how ill, but how old every such bastard
is. Only (if our Reader desire to see the deformity hereof) he may have
recourse unto the first Lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 26.
book, where the Romish Doctors do both commiserate andd complain of the
visible impiety, wherein also many Romish worshippers are found to have been
damnably idolatrous.

8 And for a supply (if yet any supply may be necessary) we produce the
testimonies of their Hos sequi videtur Peresius -- Primum con tendit fallo dici
signi ac rei significatae cogitationem seu notitiam eandem esle, cum sint duae,
quae a se inuicem distinguantur: primu^ quippe apprehenditur hoc vel illud
signum esse, deinde tem intuemur, quam significat: haec siunt simul quidem
tempore, sed natura and ratione vnum eorum alterum praecedit: deinde quamuis
lapis, marmora, aut metallum siant signum, non tamen iccirco naturam suam
commutant, neque limitem superant insensibil^um rerum, neque dignitatem
rationalis creaturae attingunt, vel habent secum comunctam rem, quam
significant. Regem quidem adoramus in purpura sua, quae si ab Imperatore
seiungatur, ne quicquam illi Regis honorem exhiberemus. August. hom. 58 de
verbis Dom. Christi humanitatem latria scribit adorandam, quia coniunctam habet
diuinitatem, quae si seiungetur (quod tamen faciendum non est) latria non
adoraretur: quanto ergo minus crux, quae reuera separata est a Christo, latria
coli non debet? --
Peresius, Gabriel quoque Brel in Can. lect. 49. eorum sententiam, vt saniorem,
probat, qui dicunt quod imago neque vt consideratur in se, secundum quod lignum
est, lapis, aut metallum, neque vt consideratur secundum rationem signi and
imaginis, sit adoranda: qualitercunque enim consideretur, inquit, est res
insensibilis, and creatura, cui adoratio (...) minime est exhibenda: Hinc patet
quorundam hominum stolidus error, qui adeo ad imagines afficiuntur, vt in ipsis
credant esse aliquod numinis, gratiae, vel sanctitatis, quibus potentes sint
facere miracula, praestare sanitates, ex hoc assurgentes ad little venerationem,
vt promissorum aliquid consequantur. Arguitur, inqui^, ex codem nonnullorum
indocta simplicitas and indiscretio, qua reuerentius adorant imagines pulchras,
quam turpes; nouas, quam vetustas: aut contra ornatas venustio^i auro vel
purpura, quam nudas, credentes eas sanctiores, quo pretiosiores, and, vt
Bernardus ait, offerentes libentius auro tectis, vbi magis cernitur diuitia^um
cumulus. Arguitur and aliorum rudis leuitas, qui improuide vota emittunt, and
ad pereg^inandum se obligant, nunc ad illam, nunc ad aliam Ecclesiam intuitu
certarum imaginum, credentes illas maio^i in illa, quam similes in alijs
fulgere a virtutibus, clarere miraculis, and maiore fulciri potestate. Haec
omnia in vanam transeunt superstitionem, in quam non inciderent, si rationem
adorationis ac very cultus attenderent: aut si ignorant, informationem
humiliter acciperent. Hactenus G^briel Biel.

is See a little before at the letters, s, u.
confuted, and the giddiness of somekinde of worshippers condemned,
especially, for See the letter, t.
believing that there is infused into Images a kind of divine power and
sanctity; seeing that their parcell-guilt conceits, and excuses yield greater
honor unto a new Image than unto an old, and unto a trim one than unto a
mean: commending their vows unto Images, and making pilgrimages unto pictures
of the same Saint, rather in one place, than in another. Which are notable
characters and notes of superstition. We conclude, Let not new conceitednesse
control the wisdom of our Ancients, who primitiuely condemned this for
fear of Idolatry, a sin most execrable.

CHAP. XXVIII.
Of confessed Romish Innouations in ceremonial matters, both in some
particulars, and also in a burdensome and oppressing multitude in the Roman
Church.
SECT. 1.
FIrst their prayers upon beads, which was first devised by Est modus orandi
postremo inuentus per calculos, vt ita dicam, ligneos, quos vulgus modo
preculas, modo paternostros appellat. Ij namero quinquaginta quinque ita ordine
distinguuntur, vt post denos singuli maiuseuli affigantur filo, sunt enim
perforati. -- Eius rei author fertur Petrus Eremita, homo Gallus, ciuis
Ambiauensis, qui abhinc annis 430. hoc est, circiter annum salutis 1090
sanctitate floruit. Polydor. Virg. Invent. rerum, lib. 5. c. 9. page 344. 345.
Petrus a French Eremite, Anno 1090, may well be sent again into the desert,
where it was first hatched, because they are contented to pray by number,
whilst most of them (which is the height of stupidity) know no more what they
pray than do their very beads: which in the day of judgment must serve for a
memorandum and recount of their so often Matthew. 6. 7.
Battologies and vain Bablings, which our Savior Christ has condemned.

2 Secondly, shall we go to visit their Temples? Herein many ceremonies have
been altered, and some of them (we confess) were alterable: as namely the
fashion of praying toward the East: which was ancient, but afterward changed,
because of the Manichaei cu^ haeresin suam periurio dissim^larent, qui solemn
veluti numen, superstition* ad orientem conuersi adorabant; constituit ^^eo 1.

East: yet was it afterward revived again by Sacerdos in altari, and in

3 Thirdly, albeit their Cardinal Bellarmine will have us to Est autem hoc

apparet ex Clem. Alex. paedagog lib. 3. ca. 11. Pili (inquit) tondendi sunt non

observe, that anciently clipping and polling was in use, but shauing was
forbidden: yet do we now see their Priests shorn unto the barescalpe.

4 Fourthly, what undoubted Author can they produce for their confessed
novelty of See above lib. 1. cap. 3. Sect. (...).
baptizing of Belles?

5 Fifthly, goodly Temples and specious Churches are both instruments and
ornaments of religion, but to be used unto devotion, and not for ostentation,
much less (as the Jews did in saying, Templum Domini) unto exptobration: as
though true religion could not at any time consist without them. Which conceit
does commonly possess the vulgar Romanists, whom their Auentinus can inform
of a time, Auentinus etiam de veteribus Germanis scribens, Maiores, inquit,
nostri, religiosissimi mortales, viua Dei simulachra and templa nos esse
existim^runt, and pro vero habuerunt, mentes nostras penetralia, pectora
sacraria corda aras esse spiritus coelestis: illa non auro, pictura aut
pecunia, rebus nimirum profanis, ac quibus vera sacra pollui solent: sed
iustiti^, modestia, benignitate and liberalitate in pauperes, pietateque
excoluerunt. Certique in hac vita nequaquam se habitare sed peregrinari
duntaxat, non sumptuosas aut munificas aedes nec sibi, nec superis
construxerunt; perangustis delub^is and domibus, quae iniuriam coeli arcerent,
contentos fuisse compertum habeo. Nihil pompae datum est, pietatem magnifice
coluerunt. Nihil voluptati oculorum indulsere, paupertatis amatores, non luxus,
aut diuitiarum admiratores. And,
when as our ancestors (says he) did not addict themselves unto this kind of
pompousnesse: for which cause their Walfridus lib. de offic ac ritibus, cap.
14. de extructione templorum agens, dicit, Videndum esse vt ex just partis
extruantur, idque moderate and multis inculcat, long satius esse pauperibus
subuenire, quam parietes templorum ornate. Citat quoque exemplum Gregorij, quem
dicit non in templorum extructione, and exornatione, vt alios Papas labor^sse,
sed in doctrini and eleemosynis. And,
Walfridus requires a moderation, even from the example of S. Gregory: the
consideration whereof moved their Cardinal Petrus quoque de Aliaco Cardinalis
Cameracen. de multitudine templorum conqueritur in lib. de Reformatione
Ecclesiae, quem Concilio Constantiensi obtulit. Haec Hospinianus de orig.
Templorum, fol. 14.
Aliacus to wish a reformation in this behalf.

6 Sixthly, the music of their Churches is not a little out of tune, while as
their own Author could not but declaime against it; because that now Cantores
nostri in templis nostris constrepunt, vt nihil pretervocem audiatur, and qui
intersunt (intersunt autem quotquot ciuitas cap^^) clamorum consensu contenti,
de vi ver borum nihil curant: vnde eo ventum est vt omnis diuini cultus ratio
in istis canto^ibus sita esse videatur. Polyd. Virg. Invent. lib 6. cap. 2. But
the Romish Index Expurg. has spunged this out of the la^e Editions.
it is come to that pass (says he) that the whole worship of God may seem to
consist herein. This is another nouelrie, wherewith their Jesuit Coster is so
delighted, that he has bent his wit to justify and commend it: Cantus
Ecclesiasticus non ad populum intelligentia verborum instituendum, sed suaui
melodia maiestateque action is reuerentiam, cultumque excitandum est
institutus. Costerus Ies. Enchirid. cap. 19.. Quarta propositio.
Church-song (says he) is not invented for to instruct the people in the
understanding of the words, but to excite them unto worship and reverence by
the melody and majesty of the action. Which shows that their doctrine does
iump with their degenerate practis^: which Innovation their Lindane in his
Panoplie and military furniture, (wherewith he armeth his Reader against
Protestants) does not obscurely both confess and condemn. Ve^um hanc labem I
cclesia ^^de forte contraxisse cuiqua^ videatur, quod quae nunc passim
cantantur, non ^am ad populi intelligent^am (...), quod priscos vbique
spectasse indubita^um est, qu^m ad mera^ Dei opt ^^udem quocunque modo
celebrandam ^requentantur: de quo e^isque remedio quid ^ap^entioribus videatur,
au^^re nialo disciturus, quam defini^e, indubiam multorum incur^^irus
reprehensionem. Lin ^^nus Panop. lib. 4 ca^. 78. page 407.
Some (says he) may per adventure think, that this is a blemish in the
(Romish) Church, because those things which are commonly su^g in Churches,
serve not so much for the edification of people (which our ancestors,
doubtless did euery-where respect) as that the Churches may be freque^ted
merely for the celebrating of Gods praise howsoever: but of this and the
remedy hereof, I had rather learn what wise men judge, than define any thing
my self, and thereby to incur the undoubted reproose of many. But what
should he need to fear to speak a truth, o^ desire to hear wise men of this
age judge of that, whereof (as he confesses) Ancients, and, in that name,
wiser men have formerly determined? Hieronymus non simpliciter vituperat
cantum, sed reprehendit eos, quim Ecclesia cantant more theatrico. --
Augustinus Confess. lib. 10. Cum (...), accidit, vt me amplius cantus, qu^m res
quae cantatu^, moueat, poenaliter me peccasle consiteor, and tunc mallem me non
andire cantantem. Aquinas 2. 2. q. 91. ad 2. and Senensis ann^t. 304. lib 6.
B^^lioth. S.
S. Hierome (says their Aquinas) reproved the theatricall form of singing;
and S. Augustine held it a sin to be less delighted with the dittie, than
with the tune.

7 But what do we trouble our Reader with delivering such like Innouations by
retaile, which we may utter by gross? For our Adue^ saries themselves have See

The Conclusion.
SECT. 2.
8 It were a kind of detraction from thy judicious attention (good Reader) if
we should again remention the already sp^^ified par^^^ula^ changes of
doctrines, ^ites, and customs: therefore will we forbea^^ all repetition of
them, until we shall be provoked thereunto: yet, for conclusion sake, we judge
their Church to be pieced up with varieties o^ new alterations, which by tract
of time have been multiplied therein, as though it had been presigured by
Theseus his ship, which (excepting the name and Cari^^.
bottom thereof) was nothing less then the same. Only give us leave to add
two points, wherein it may seem to excel all antiquity of any kind. The
first we take from their Thuanus, their own historian, speaking of the last
Cum prudentiores, ^^^me Protes^antium part^^us addicti, ad se ex tristi
praesentis status cogitatione sensi^ redijssent, and factum execrantes, eius
causas, and excusationem curio^a vestigatione quaererent, sic iudicabant;

massacre in France:) Wise men (says he) seeking all manner of excuse for that
fact, did notwithstanding think that in all antiquity there could not be
found an example of like cruelty. And was not their powder plot also excellent
and unmatchable?

9 The second is the pretended infallibility of judgment, which they
attribute unto the Pope, in all matters which he shall prescribe unto the whole
Church to be believed: which, by confession, See hereafter.
will appear to be as notable a ground of all heresy, as the other example^*
as rare and peerless for cruelty. In the interim we must answer unto the
Apologists objections.

CHAP. XXIX. Whether there be an Innovation in the Church, without an open
resistance, and whether a no resistance be a sufficient argument of no
Innovation. In which questions our Adversaries own instances are retorted upon
themselves.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
This point therefore is not our only assertion or urging, but is also yet
further grounded upon the confessed sense of Scriptures, which teach that See

always resist all false opinions with open reprehension: The office also and
nature of the Church argues no less, for how can she be the true Church, and
yet suffer so many and important errors as are pretended to invade her
children, without resistance upon her part? The experience likewise of all
former times is answerable hereunto, for in this sort have the old heresies of
the Grecians and Latins been discovered, and See this at large in the several
treatises of Tren cus, Epiphanius, Theodoret, Augustine, Damascene, etc.
written purposely by them against heresies:
contradicted. In this sort were of later times, Berengarius, Waldo, Wicliffe,
Luther, etc. ever at their first arising contradicted and charged with
Innovation. In this sort lastly, is the defection or change in doctrine
heretofore made by the First concerning the defection of the Greek Church, the
more ancient examples thereof in Paulus Samosatenus, Macedonius, Nestorius,
etc. are so memorable, as further testimony thereof needs not. 2. Secondly,
as concerning the several defections for latter times of the Greek Church
from the Roman, they are testified by Nicephorus, Zonoras, Clycas, Hunbertus
against Nicetas, and others. And in part by some Protestants, as namely by
Crispinus in his discourse of the estate of the Church. page 364. fine, and
253. initio. And by Osiander in his Epitom. Centur. 9. 10. 11. etc. p. 144.

1. page 68, and 69. Twelve times or thereabout^ has the Greek Church
reconciled it self to Rome, and afterward fallen from thence, being thereupon
now at last wholly oppressed with ba^barous Tu^cisme. 3. Thirdly, as concerning
the several errors (few in comparison) wherein the Greek Church at this day
dissenteth from the Roman: their beginning and contradiction is notorious: as
for example, their denia^l of subjection to the Roman sea was begun by John of
Constantinople, and he thereupon specially contradicted by ^regory the great,
l. 4. cp. 34. and 36. and l. 7. cp. 36. and 64. and by Pelagius in his Epistle,
vniuersis Episcopis qui illieita vocatione loannis Constantinop. ad Synodum
conueneiunt. Also their denial of prayer for the dead was begun by Aerius, and
contradicted in him by Austin, haer. 53. and by Epiphanius, haer. 75. And yet
afterward in both these doctrines they conformed themselves to Rome, as is
reported by M. Spark vbi supra, and by Osiander Cent. 15. page 477. and by
Crispinus vbi supra, page 451. In like manner their defense of marriage of
Priests was contradicted against Theodorus by Chrysostom. in epist. 6 ad
Theodorum Monachum: and against certain other by Epiphanius haer. 59. ante
med. Also their denial of the holy Ghosts proceeding from the Father and the
Son, was begun and gainsaid about Anno 764. as witnesses our adversary
Keckermanus in System. theolog. page 68. The denial of unleavened bread in the
celebration of the Sacrament, was begun about Anno Domini 1053. as appears by
^eo the ninth, in epist. ad Michaelem Episcopum Constantinop. c. 5. and by
Osiander Cent. 11. page 156. pest med. and by the Century writers. Centur. 11.
c. 8. Like example might be given of their other, but few and lesser errors,
the which Anno Domini 870. consist (as appears by the testimony of Crispinus
in his discourse of the estate of the Church, page 253. initio) but only in
the Primacie and the diversity of ceremonies, as appears by the two several
treatises translated lately into Latin, the one made by Hieremias Patriatch of
Constantinople, the other entitled Responsio Ioannis Basilij magn^ Du^is
Mus^ouiae, etc. Anno 1570. and published and replied unto by Ioannes Lasicins a
Protestant writer of Poland, and extant in the book entitled de Russorum,
Muscouitarum and Tartarorum religione, etc. printed 1582. And it appears in
the treati^e set forth by the Protestant Divines of Witteberg, entitled Acta
Theologorum Witebergensium and Hieremiae Patriarchae Constantinopale Augustana
confessione, etc. printed Witebergae Anno 1584. That the Greek Church yet to
this day professes and teaches Invocation of Saints and Angels (page 55.
fine, 102 ante med. and 128. initio) Relics (page 243. fine, and 368. post

yet to this day remain unchanged.
GREEK CHVRCH, to us (though in comparison strangers thereunto) at this day
yet discouerable.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THe sum of all this, and of the next Section may be reduced unto this
syllogism. All notorious changes in Religion, have received present and open
resistances and reprehensions. But the Church of Rome (say they) has not been
openly resisted in the opinions, which are laid unto her charge. Ergo, she has
not committed in them any notorious alteration. The proposition they labor to
fortify by Scripture, and by experience.

2 The sense of Scripture is not to be applied universally, but (...), that is,
for the most part: for in the ancient Church we have heard of the doctrine of
the Sea above.
Millenarij, held by Irenaeus, and other fathers of their time; and of the
doctrine of (that we may so term them) Paideucharistitae, defending the
necessity of the administration of the Eucharist unto children, whereof Pope
See above lib. 2 cap. 13.. 3.
Innocentius was a principal patron: both which opinions are now condemned as
new and erroneous by our Adversaries themselves; which notwithstanding passed
for current in their times, not only without resistance, but even with the
approbation of the chief Pastors of the Church. Like as there happened a
notable alteration in the succession of their Popedom, when notwithstanding
there was so little resistance made against the intruders into the cl^aire of
Rome, that their Cardinal Baronius deploring the misery of that usurpation,
feared not to say, that then See below Sect. 3. a.
all Christ's disciples were asleep; as either not able, or not daring to
contradict so notorious Innovation.

3 Their confirmation from experience is less probable: for resistance is a
word of mutual dependence and reciprocation, as appears in the two grand
Barators and common suitors in the law, Style, and Oak; the one is the
plaintiff, the other the defendant; each does resist the other in the question
of right, and the matter in the end is referred unto the Judge, who is to
discern whether of these parties is erroneous: but how? Not by the beginning
of open resistance, but by the light of their evidence, and the letter of the
law. So in religion, resistance, which is a pro and contra, is no sufficient
conviction of error by it self.

4 Secondly, in their assumption, pretending that no example can be given of
resistance against any alteration of religion in the Church of Rome, they call
for some examples hereof more instantly in their next Section: therefore we
being troubled with abundance of those instances which have been See above.
related, will single out only two of these which the Apologists have here
propounded for the ground of their contrary experience, viz. the Grecians, and
Luther.

5 Many resistances made against the Greek Church in several doctrines, have
been See above.
before objected by the Apologists, and by us, in the most particulars,
confuted; which now again they recapitulate, burthening a whole page with the
repetition of them: showing themselves hereby nimium diligentes, even seriously
superfluous. That which first we have selected out of many, is the example of
the Grecians denying subjection unto the Sea of Rome; which was begun (say the
Apologists) by John Bishop of Constantinople, who was therefore contradicted by
Pope Gregory the Great, lib. 4. epist. 34.

6 This assertion concerning the [deniall of subjection by the Grecians unto
Rome,] although it be See confuted above lib. 1. cap. 11. etc.
false, yet will we (for disputation sake) suppose it to be true. The thing
that Pope Gregory did condemn in John Patriarch of Constantinople, was the Sea
above lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 19.
title of universal Bishop of the Church. This indeed S. Gregory did
contradict, calling it a See ibidem.
title of novelty, of error, of impiety, of blasphemy, and the very poison
of the Church of Christ: which (says he) never any of my Predecessors
consented to use: adding, that whosoever shall usurp it, is the forerunner of
Antichrist. Notwithstanding, Pope Boniface (who did succeed S. Gregory next
except one, did (as has been confesled) assume that title of universal
Bishop; and the Popes, ever after him, have challenged it as a special
p^erogatiue of their Popedom.

7 Now let these great disputers maike what will be the force of this their
own instance. The title of universal Bishop, and dominion thereby implied,
is, by the judgment of S. Gregory, no more belonging unto the Bishop of Rome,
than it did unto the Greek Patriarch. We hence make bold to demand, Was this
resisted in Boniface, the first usurper of it in the Roman Church, or not? If
it was resisted, then must the Apologists, by their doctrine, confess it to be
an Innovation: if it was not resisted, then is it possible that an Innovation
might pass without resistance.

8 Afterward Luther is produced for an Innouator, because his opinion was
contradicted and resisted at his first rising. But what was his first opinion,
and of what kind was his first resistance? First of his opinion: Martinus
Lutherus nostro seculo ab Indulgentiarum repraehensione principium fecit sectae
suae propagandae, vt perspicuum est ex astertionibus articulorum a Leone 10.
damnatoru^. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Indulg. cap. 1. page 7.
Martine Luther (says their Cardinal Bellarmine) did begin his opposition
unto Rome in reprehending their article of Indulgences. Concerning his
resistance, Leo decimus, anno salutis 1517. habuit in Germani^ procuratores
Indulgentiarum, -- quas illi praedicarent valere non solum ad salutem viuoru^,
verumetiam mortuorum animas subleuandas, quae in Purgatorio essent. Tum praesto
fuit Lutherus, Augustinianus Monachus, homo in Theologia apud suam Gentem
primatius, qui illud improbarit Procuratores ea revalde commoti, primo quoque
tempore nome^ Lutheri Roman ad Magistratus deferunt; is continuo vt deoru^
contemptor accusatur, citatur, causa agitur: sed quia ad die^ dictam non adfuit
Romae praesens vt relponderet, paulo post declaratur haereticus. Polyd. Virgil.
lib. 8. Invent. cap. 4 page 492. purged out by the Romish Index.
Pope Leo the tenth (says Polydore) sent his Proctors into Germany, who
preached the article of Indulgences, affirming, that they are powerful both
for the good of the living, and also for the ease of souls tormented in
Purgatory. Luther then rose up to disprove them, and was therefore presently
cited to Rome, and accused; and because he did not appear at the day assigned
to answer to the accusation made against him, he was forthwith pronounced an
heretic. Here we see Luther resisting the Pope, and the Pope resisting
Luther: the matter is the doctrine of Indulgences, which (as has been
confested by the Romanists themselves) See above lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 20. And
in this book, cap. 12. Sect. 1.
is not expressly delivered either in Scripture, or in the writings of ancient
Fathers: nor was in use in the primitive Church: but has been termed by their
own Authors a doctrine of godly deceit, and indeed a palpable novelty. Now
then, the case is plain, the Popes resistance does not prove the Innovation of
Luthers doctrine, but the Inuouation of the Popes doctrine does justify
Luthers resistance.

9 Waldo, Wickliffe, and Luther (give me leave thus far to digress) are
brought in as though they were authors of three different religions: this is
our Adversaries guise, whenever they happen upon the mention of these names;
whereas (if they shall be willing to confer with their own Thuanus) they may
be otherwise directed. He shows that those who are commonly called Igitur P.

Waldensis, Piccards, Albigenses, Cathari, Lollards, though from their dissent
of place and other circumstances they have diverse names, yet hold they the
same faith which VVicleffe held in England, and Husse in B^h^mia, and gathered
strength at the coming of Luther; especially in the Capra^ienses, who professed
a religion agreeing almost in all things with Martin Luther: them did Cardinal
Sadolet examine, and found many things maliciously s^^^ed against them. We
return into the way again.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And could then our home neighbor Rome, only Rome, cast off her primitive
faith, and in liew thereof set abroach pretended errors, not few but many, not
small but of importance, not of beli^fe only, but of practice (as Prayer for
the dead: Prayer to Saints: Pilgrimage: vowed Chastity: Monachisme: Offering
of external sacrifice unto God: and above all (to omit many other) the
external adoring (as Protestants think of bread and wine for God,) Neither
keep these private to her self, but therewithal infect so many Christian

never suffering for the space of a 1000. years after Siluester the first,
(nor before for any thing that is alleged, so much as) any to be seen
vouchable or visible of the true Church, to match or encounter her?

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 2.
10 But who is a man's neighbor? was it the Priest or the Leuite, who both
passed by the man that lay wounded in their way? O no, but the Samaritane, who
had compassion on the distressed, and powered oil and wine into his wounds, to
heal him and preserve him alive: this man was his neighbor that fell among
thieves. Why then should the Apologists vpbraid England with the neighborhood
of Rome, whose wine is turned into vinegar, oil intogall, bread into powder,
and fish into a serpent, pursuing that Island not with prayers of compassion,
but with fire of persecution?

11 What shall induce us to think that Rome has not cast off her first faith?
We have heard, by the confession of her own Cardinals, Bishops, and Doctors,
that she is manifoldly declined from the primitive profession, both in doctrine
and practice of Christianity, concerning matters of no less moment than are
the Scriptures, Sacraments, Justification, Prayers, and almost the whole frame
and government of the Church, and sincere form of the worship of God?

12 The sentence of our See above lib. 1. cap. 8. Sect. 2.
Napeir, like as the preposterous fruit of the womb, comes with the heels
out first: for that which he speaks but of one point of Popery, even the
Papal authority, the same do the Apologists apply universally unto all the
members of the Romish profession: and that argument, which he took only from a
feined Romish suppositio^, they enforce as proceeding from his positive
asseueration. Which his supposition has been contradicted by all ancient
story, revealing unto us the diverse oppositions of many Churches, and
Councels, and Fathers (we may also add, Christian Christiani Imperatores saepe
iudic^r^nt ac deposuerunt Pontisices. -- quo iure ipsi viderint. Bellarm. lib.
2. de Pont. cap. 29.. Argumentum quintum.
Emperors) against the Papal authority. And can any one requite in any thing
a more notorious resistance?

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Whereas yet our Adversaries themselves, do acknowledge and report Reported at

every age.

writers vbi supra, and by the other Ecclesiastical writers of every age: and

the ROMAN Church. And though we should suppose all this so strangely to have
happened, could yet so great and strange a wonder, but so much as in that one
foresaid example of Whereas our adversaries preten^ that Honorius the third who
was Pope Anno 1* 20. did first bring in the adoration of the Sacrament, it is a
mere fiction for no writer of that age did gainsay or so much as charge him
with Innovation herein: only he did ordain that Priests should admonish the
people against their negligence in that behalf. Before this Honorius, Odo
Parisiensis who lived 117^. (in Synodicis constitutionibus cap. 5. de Sacram.
altaris) says in like manner: Frequent^r moneantur Laici, vt vbicunque
viderint deferri corpus Domini, statim genua slectant tanquam D^mino and
creatori suo, and tunctis manibus quoadusque (...) orent: also Algerus Anno
Domini 1060. l. de sacram. Eucha^ist l. 2. c. 3. fine, says: Hac side ipsum
Sacramentum quasi (...) quiddam and rationabile alloquimur and roganus: Agnu^
Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miscrere nobis; quia non quod vid^t^r, ^^quod
vere est, Christum ibi esse credimus. Also Antonius Praetorius a learned
Calmnist, in libro de sacramentis, page 288. prope initium, telling how
Damascene taught Transubstantiation, withal further says. Anno 735 Subs^^^ta
est panis adoratio, a^i ipse Christus esset. And so accordingly Carrion in his
Chronie. page 451 prope initium does not only charge Damascene most expressly
with Transubstantiation, but does also (ibidem page 476. circa med. and 477
paulo ante med.) place Artolat^^a: That is to say (says he) the adoration of
the reserved and cleuated bread (sequentibus annis quin ^e^tis, etc.) within
these (...) ^^ue ^undreth yearesafter Christ. By which only premises, as it
is clear and confessed, that adoration of the Sacrament wa^ v^ed long before
the time of Honorius the third: so also it is as evident and confessed by
Protestants, and namely by (...) (Act. Mon. page 896. b. fine, and after the
edition of Anno 1596. page 1276. a line 14.) that if this Honorius did not
begin the same, the first beginning thereof is then so far from being ^ound,
that we cannot (says M. Fox) find it to ^^me in by a^^^ther. Add but now
hereunto the answerable testimonies of Austine in Psalm. 98. of An brose de
Spiritu sancto, l 3. c 12. of Theodoret. ^ ^al. 2. of Chrysostom in 1. Cor
hom. 24. of Basil de Spiritu sancto, cap 27. of Nazianzen in Epit^ph Gorgoniae,
and of Dionysius Areopagita de Eccles^hiera^ch c. 3. which are so plain and
agreeable with our external adoration of Christ in the Sacrament, that our
adversary Chemnitius does for such allege sundry of them against our
adversaries the Sacramentaries, in his Examen Council. Trident. part 2. p. 92.
adoring the Sacrament for God (much more in so many other points of faith)
have been so brought and diuulged into so many Christian Nations near and
remote, and not once testified or remembered, so much as by any one of the
Churches enemies neither heretical nor profane? were the Churches own
pastors, her home enemies and strangers to her religion all of them silent
herein?

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing the Romish error in adoration of the
Sacrament, and how their apostasy might begin and grow for a time, without
resistance.
SECT. 3.
13 If we shall suppose an uncertainty, when adoration of this Sacrament first
began, or who resisted it; must it thereupon be collected, that it was from the
beginning of our Christian faith? This is the Apologists general consequence,
which they will have to hold not in doctrine See the former Section.
of belief only, but also in practice. Therefore do we hold it sit, first, to
put them in mind of one observation, which Baronius their late Cardinal has
committed unto public record: Quae tunc facies sanctae Ecclesia Romanae? quam

Baronius Tom. 10. Anno Christi 912. number. 8. page 779.
What a face of the Church of Rome (says he) shall we call this, which was in
those days, when as the most common and potent strumpets, according unto their
pleasures, disposed of Bishoprics, and (which is horrible either to hear or
speak of) placed counter. Popes, their own paramours, in S. Peter's chair?
for who can hold them for true successors, who wanted both the election and
approbation of the Clergy? Whilst that the ancient Canons and decrees of
elder Popes were suppressed, and the former customs of election utterly
extinct, then, as it may seem, Christ lay in his ship (meaning the Church)
asleep, and it was beaten and tossed with raging tempests, and he dissembled,
as it were, that he saw those evils, by permitting them to sway; yea (which is
the worst) there was not found any one among his Disciples, who listed to waken
our Lord, all of them being in a shorting sleep. What kind of Cardinals were
then chosen by those monsters? doubtless, we must think that they followed
the course of natural creatures, whose property is to beg^t their like, whose
vices they would imitate, and wish that the Lord should sleep always, and
never arise unto judgment.

14 This is a plain testimony of their choice and uncontrollable witness
confessing not a winking, but a sleeping, not of their people only, but also
of their Clergy, even from the lowest up unto the Cardinals (who are accounted
the Sea above lib. 4. cap. 19. Sect. 2.
fundamental supporters of the Church in both spiritual and temporal
causes,) by suffering a corrupt and pestilent succession not only in
Bishoprics, but in that which they call the Chair of S. Peter, the seat of
the Bishop of Bishops, even the Popedom it self, by intrusion of monsters,
according unto the lust of famous whores. Can the Apologists require a more
notorious and ugly change in practice than this? or in a subject matter of more
importance, or more free from open resistance, when behold, all the Disciples
are stark asleep? We leave their practice, and return unto the doctrine.

15 It is a true signification, which one of our Doctors has delivered, viz.
Transubstantiatione^ subsecuta est adoratio, that is: Adoration of this
Sacrament did follow upon the doctrine of Transubstantiation. Therefore
adoration could be but an embryo before the days of Pope Innocentius the 3, at
what time Transubstantiation grew to be of so perfect a strength, as first then
to become a doctrine of faith, as their own Doctors have affirmed. This makes
the judgment of our Hospinian (an author often cited by the Apologists) to
seem more probable, who ascribes the beginning of adoration unto Sacerdos
quilibet frequent^r plebem doceant suam, vt cum in celebratione Missarum
eleuatur hostia, se reuerent^^ inclinet: idem faciens, cum eam defert Presbyter
ad infirmum Honorius 3. Decret. de celeb. Missarum, lib. 3. Tit 41. cap. Sane
cum olim.
Pope Honorius the third, who lived some few years before the forenamed
Innocentius.

16 This adoration increased by another Innovation used by Pope Vrbane the
fourth, who first (says Cardinal Bellarmine) instituted a solemn feast and
procession for the Eucharist (called Corpus Christi day,) which afterward Pope
Clemens the sift did confirm, to the intent that by the public adoration
thereof, the rude people might be more easily instructed concerning the real
(meaning, corporal) presence of Christ in the Sacrament. Where, by the way, we
are to understand, that even the ordinance of Pope Vrbane seems not to have
been void of resistance, seeing that, Qu^a illa constitutio V^bant non ^uit
recepta ab omnibus, ideo Clemens Papa quintus innouauit illam constitutionem,
and illam praecepit ab omnibuster^ari. G^ssa^^ Clement. cap. Vnicum. Tit. De
Reliq and Venerat.
forasmuch as (thus their Gloss speaks) the constitution of Vrbane was not
received of all, therefore did Pope Clemens command it to be universally
received. Yet one would think it strange that it found no more general and
free passage in those times, if the doctrine of Indulgences had then possessed
men's Creeds: specially seeing that Summam Indulgentiarum, quas Vrbanus quartus,
Clemens quiatus, Martinus quintus, and Eugenius 4. ipsis, qui ipso die festo
intersunt primis and secundis Vesperis, vel Missae vel Matutino, Iuhanus
Ponerius collegit, and assurgit ad 16000. dierum Indulgentias. Hospinian hist
Sacram. lib. 4. page 387.
the Indulgences which Popes did multiply upon them (who honored this feast by
their presence at the Church,) did amount unto sixteen thousand days pardon.

17 We need not much dispute about this institution, because their own
Consulter has sufficiently displaied this Innovation: Quare videtur hic
circumgestationis vsus, citra grave Ecclesiae damnum imo cum ipsius lucro (si
modo id prudenter fiat) omitti posse, cum and recens sit, and diu sine ista cir
cumgestatione, sacramento suus honos constiterit, and hodie constare possit.
Deinde cum hodie plerumque non deuotioni populi, sed pompae magis and
ostentationi serutat: itaque vir summi iudicij Albertus Cranzius in sua
Metropoli, Nicolaum Cusanum legatum per Germaniam laudat, qui abusum Sacramenti
Euch^ristiae in nimis frequenti eius pet singulas ferias circumgest atione
sustulerit, and constituit, vt nisi inter octauas festi Sacramento dedicati in
publicum non defe^tetur, additque; idem Albertus memorabilem causam, quia
inquit eius sacramenti vsus a coelesti magistro institutus est, ad vsum, non
ostentationem: de ipso vero festo certum est illud ab Vrbano, non ad
circumgestationem institutum, sed ad celebriorem conuentum* and vt homines per
pietatis opera ita se praeparent, quo huius pretiosi Sacramenti eo die
participes fieri, atque ipsum reuerenter su^cipere mereantur: ita enim habent
verba Decreti, ad quod institutum si redeatur, nis puto fore absurdi. Cassander
de Consult. art. 22.. De circumgestatione. page 174.
This custom of circumgestation of the host (says he) may be left, with (if
it be wisely laid down) greater profit unto the Church, both because it is but
a new invention, as also because it serves rather for a pompous ostentation,
than for any godly devotion; and so (as Albertus Cranzius says) is contrary
unto Christ his institution.

18 What the judgment of Antiquity was concerning adoration, we cannot learn
until we take forth this first lesson of understanding their phrases.
Dionysius Areopagita is usually objected, where he says unto the Eucharist, O
diuimssima, and sacra ceremonia. Dionys. Hierarch. Eccles. cap. 3. in Theoria.
O thou most divine and sacred ceremony! But this was spoken in the same
meaning (says Pachymeres) Ceremoniam hanc alloquitur, qua animatasit. -- vt

holy feast! which is but a figurative prosopopoeia: Haec verba, [O Pascha

Dei] and quae deinceps sequuntur, ad Christum spiri^uale Pascha per

Adversaries confess they themselves mean, when they say unto the Cross, See
above lib. 2 cap. 2.

had plentiful trial of the hyperbolicall speeches of Fathers, sounding like
unto these sayings of Nazianzen, who in an Homily comparing the day of Christ
his resurrection with the days of Christ his passion and burial, Heri cum
Christo in crucem agebar, sussigebar: hodie simul glorificor: heri commoriebar,
hodie simul viuisicor: heri con^epeliebat, hodie simul resurgo. Greg.

Let a man invoke upon Baptism. And S. Augustine, Baptismum Christi vbique
veneramur. August. epist. 164.
We worship the Baptism of Christ, wheresoever it is. And again, explicating
himself by comparing the Qui veneratur vtile signum diuinitus institutum,
cuius vim significationemque intelligit, non hoc veneratur quod videtur and
transit, sed illud potius, quo talia cuncta referenda sunt: -- Sicuti est
Baptismi Sacramentum, and celebratio corporis and sanguinis Domini: quae
vnusquisque cum percipit, quo referantur imbutus agnoseit, vt ea non carnali
seruiture, sed spirituali potius liberate veneretur. Aug. de doct. Christ.
lib. 3. cap. 9.
worshipping of Baptism and the Sacrament of Christ's body together, which
(says he) whosoever receives, knows whereunto they are referred, so that he
worshippeth them not with a carnal servitude, but with a spiritual liberty.
And who knows not that it is not Baptism, but Christ in the ministration of
Baptism that is to be muocated, and adored, and worshipped? Which kind of
paralleling of phrases used by ancient Fathers, concerning Baptism and the
Eucharist, may be as good as any Comment for our right understanding of
antiquity. Howbeit, that reverence which belongs unto the sacred things of
God, cannot without impiety be denied unto the holy Sacraments, because in them
we have sealed unto us that eternal and saving truth, which is promised in the
word, where of Tertullian said, Adoro plenitudinem Scripturarum. Tertull.
aduersus Hermog. post medium.
I adore the fullness of Scriptures.

19 Damascene, who lived about the year 740. has this sentence: Damascenus,
qui circa ann. Domini 470. claruit. l. 3. c. 7. de orthodox. side scribit,
propter saluas and inconfusas in union proprietates non esse incircumscriptae
diuinitati aequare vbique corpus. Item, prorsus impossible esse, contrarias
substantiales differentias, sicut est, visibile and inuisibile, palpabile and
impalpabile, circumscriptum and incircumscriptum esse, simul in corpo^e and
Christi humana natura coexistere. Vt refert Hospiman hisi. Sacram. lib. 3. cap.
7. page 256.
It is impossible for two contrary essential differences, such as are visible
and invisible, palpable and not palpable, circumscribed in place and not
circumscribed, to consist together in the humane nature of Christ. Which saying
is, of it self, sufficient to ouerthrowall conceit of Transubstantiation. If
his other sentence may admit an adoration in our former sense, as he speaks
himself of the worship of the Cross: yet may they not vrgently pressevs with
his authority, because he is without the compass of due antiquity, and more
especially for that he is noted by the Romanists to have been both of too

of Christ in the Eucharist, but upon presumption that Ob. Si ideo Sacramentum

stand secure and free from this assault, holding it the safest for us to adore
Christ his person in both the Sacraments; yet not as inclusiuely, but
significatiuely and representatiuely contained therein, with (as the Liturgy
teaches) a sursum corda, that is, by lifting up our thoughts unto heaven, as
the proper and only real and royal place of his mansion, until his coming
again unto judgment, according to the letter of our Creed: showing our selves
hereby not So Chrysostom speaks in one place.
Dawes, but (as Chrysostom speaks) Vbi enim (inquit) cadauer, illic Aquilae,

Eagles, soaring up into heaven, there to feed on the body of Christ, which
was slain for our sins; for where (says Christ) the carcass is, thither
will the Eagles resort: teaching us, that even when we contemplate upon his
body, now majestified and glorified, we should do it with a reference unto it,
as it was mortified and dead, because therein consisted the merit of our
redemption.

21 Lastly, although Rome could expostulate, (seeing that the heresies of other
Churches were detected and resusted at their first birth,) why Rome (o Rome)
should seem to err without any open resistance; yet so little would this
prejudice our plea against her, that it may seem rather to be fortified
thereby, because the Antichristian apostasy has this peculiar title, Apoc. 17.
5.
having in her forehead a name written, Mystery. Why? Their own Rhemists
annot. upon that place.
Rhemish Doctors give this note: S. Paul (say they) calls this secret and
close working of abomination, the mystery of iniquity, 2 Thessalonians. 2. So that
howsoever her entrance and progress did pass under such cloudie pretense of
Christian policy and godliness, yet her purple and scarlet garment, and
abomination was by degrees to be made manifest. Which may serve for a full
conviction of the Apologists, challenging us to show the authors, times, and
manner of resistance in every change.

22 To conclude, seeing that their Cardinal See a^oue
Bellarmine has well observed concerning other Patriarchall seats, except
Rome, that they have long sithence departed from the syncerity of their ancient
faith; and we have now showed the like decay in Rome also, in many and
marvelous aberrations: why should not our Adversaries acknowledge in Rome, not
only a possibility, but even an ordinary and lamentable experience of her (o
Rome) apostasy from the sincere faith?

That Catholics are able to prove the contrary, even by the testimonies of
learned Protestants. 8.

And although the proof of the ROMAN Churches supposed change of her religion
lying on our Adversaries part, and hitherto wanting, might be matter in this
behalf sufficient to offer unto your HIGHNESS learned judgment; yet will we
our selves in surplusage exhibit further demonstration of her not change in
any needful article of faith, by manifest testimony from our learned
Adversaries: First then, it is heretofore fully proved by e^ident confession of
the learned Protestants (as well in general, This is fully confessed heretofore

set Catholic, p. 36. initio, aff^^meth also that the religion of the Papists

undertake further proof thereof were tediousness both Confessed heretofore

improper and needless. This This is mani^estly affirmed and collected from
the Ecclesiastical writers of every age, and by our adversaries the Century

Gregory lived somewhat within the first 600. years after Christ; so that
having now hereby already proved the continued profession of the Roman Church
in our now taught Catholic faith for all these last thousand years: * And M.

Boniface the third. who was Bishop of Rome the second year after the death of

Boniface the third, were ill blasphemous heretics and Antichrists. And he
affirms the same in his con^utation of Purgatory, page 344 post med. And he
likewise affirms Boniface the third to be Antichrist, and that under him the
Papists religion prevailed, in his foresaid answer to a counterfeit Catholic,

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL* Showing the Apologists error, concerning S. Gregory.
SECT. 1.
ALL this their Surplussage, or further demonstration (as they call it) is
nothing else but indeed a superfluity, being only (as will appear,) a new
moulding of that mass and lump of matter which they had formerly collected:
therefore may we refer our answer with no less case than they have done
their proofs, unto This they do generally in^ their margents.
heretofore.

2 And so it shall appear, that they must seek out some new Gregory for
proof of their new doctrine of Transubstantiation, private Mass, proper
Sacrifice, half Communion, Justification by inherent righteousness,
Indulgences, worship ping of Images, as also for their oppressing multitude of
ceremonies, addition unto Canonical Scriptures, insufficiency of the written
word, and forbidding the common reading thereof, with other particulars of
Romish Religion, which old S. Gregory See about lib. 1 from chap 2 unto the 6.
chap.
never allowed: who was himself so far from being Popish, that he was not so
much as Pope, according as this creature is now defined; because he both
abhorred the title of universal Bishop, which betokens the now universal
sovereignty over the Church of Christ in all causes Ecclesiastical: and as
concerning the State temporal, he protested his subjection unto it. Ergo, this
their resumption of the continuance of the now profession of the Roman faith
for the first 600 years, is a mere precipitation.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The only difficulty and doubt leaft to be examined, is whether that she did
make change of her faith, during these other foresaid first 600 years next
after Christ. This being the maine point or issue of this present controversy:

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing their error in the maine Issue.
SECT. 2.
3 This [onely] is, we will not say one lie, but doubtless one great untruth,
as has been abundantly See above lib. 1. cap. 2.
proved: and yet this vast untruth is here laid down for the maine point and
Issue of this present controversy. So that this foundation being so sandy, it
prognosticateth the ruin of their whole structure and building. For what?

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
We will now first examine for how many hundredth years next after Christ, the
Church (e) M. Fulke in his confutation of Purgatory, p. 374. post med.
of Rome is confessed to have perseuered without revolt or change in the faith
first to her delivered: In discovery whereof, whereas our writers do object,
how that Tertullian provoked the heretics of his time with the succession of
the Roman Bishops, M. D. Fulke answering thereto affirms the reason thereof
to be, for that (says he) (The Church of Rome retained by succession until
Tertullians days, that faith which it did first receive of the Apostles. With
whom agrees herein M. D. Whitaker Whitaker de Ecclesia, p. 278. post med.
speaking of certain Apostolic Churches, and amongst them of Rome by name:
says, Vnde intelligimus cur ad illas Ecclesias prouocaret Tertullianus?
nimirum quia tum doctrinam Apostolicam perpetua successione tenebant.
and Hierome Zanchius de vera Relig. page 148. post med.
Zanchius: and where one of our writers urges In M. Fulks confutation of
Purgatory, p. 372. ante med.
the succession of the Roman Bishops by example of Irenaeus, Cyprian,
Tertullian, Optatus, Hierome, Augustine, and Vincentius Lirinensis, M. Fulke
answers thereto saying, Ibide^. p. 373. paulo ante med.
That these men specially named the Church of Rome, it was because the Church
of Rome at that time, as it was founded by the Apostles, so it continued in the
doctrine of the Apostles. And M. D. Reynolds being provoked in the same kind
acknowledges in like manner, that M. D. Rainolds in his conference with M.
Heart, p. 442. post med.
the succession of the Roman Bishops was a proof of the true faith in the
time of Austine, Epiphanius, Optatus, Tertullian, and Irenaeus, etc. And the
like acknowledgement or answer thereto, is made by many other Ridley in M.
Foxes Acts and Monuments, p. 1359. b. circa med. says, The Patriarch of Rome
in the Apostles time, and long after, was a great maintainer and setter forth
of Christ's glory, in the which above all other countries and Regions was
preached the true Gospel, the Sacraments were most duly administered, etc.
After the Emperors became Christians, the Gospel there storished most. And M.
Iuell in his Reply to M. Harding, page 346. ante med, says, As well S. Austine
as also other godly Fathers rightly yielded reverence to the sea of Rome, etc.
for the purity of religion which was there preserved a long time without spot.
And page 628. paulo post med. he further says, The godly Fathers (of those
foresaid times) sought to the Church of Rome, which then for purity in
religion, and constancy in the same, was most famous above all others.
learned Protestants: only we will conclude with Calvin, who sets down
our foresaid allegation saying of us, Calvin. Instit. l. 4. c. 2. sect. 2.
says: Magnifice illi quidem suam nobis Ecclesiam co^mendant: allegant enim eam
apud se initio sana doctrina and sanguine Martyrum been fundatam, perpetua
Episcoporum successione conseruatam fuisse ne intercideret; commemorant quanti
hanc successionem fecerunt, Irenaeus, Tertullianus, Origenes, Augustinus, et
al^.
They in deed set forth their Church to us very gloriously, etc. They report
out of Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origin, Augustine, and others, how highly they
esteemed this succession: Whereto he then answers and gives his like reason
hereof, saying, Cum extra controuersiam esset, nihil a principio vsque ad illam
aetatem mutatum fuisse in doctrina, sumebant quod omnibus nouis erroribus
conficiendis sufficeret, illos oppugnare doctrinam ab ipsis vsque Apostolis
constanter and vnammi assensu retentam. Calvin vbi supra, l. 4. cap. 2. sect. 3.
Considering it was a matter out of all doubt that from the beginning even
until that time, nothing was changed in doctrine, the (foresaid) holy Doctors
took in argument that which was sufficient for the overthrowing of all new
errors, (to wit) that they (viz. the heretics) oppugned the Doctrine which
even from the very Apostles themselves had been inuiolably and with one consent
retained: And in his book of Institutions set forth in French, he says
expressly, that Calvin in his Institutions in French, printed at Geneua by
Conradus Badius, Anno 1562. says, C'estoyt vne chose notoire and sans doubt,
que depuis L'aage des Apostres, iusques a leur temps, il ne c'esto^t art null
changement de doctrine, ny a Rome, ny aux autres villes.
It was a thing notorious and without doubt, that after the Apostles age until
those (foresaid) times, no change was made in doctrine, neither at Rome nor at
other Cities: So plainly do our learned adversaries acknowledge, that no
change of faith was made by the Roman Church from the Apostles age until the
times of Saint Austine, Epiphanius, Optatus, etc. Which was for sour hundredth
and forty years after Christ.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing that Protestants claim of Antiquity.
SECT. 3.
4 This general consent of our so profoundly judicious Protestants, in
appealing unto the primitive Church for the space of the first four hundred
and forty years after Christ, thus acknowledged by our Adversaries, may well
serve for a just reproof of their slander, who usually vpbraide Protestants
with contempt of all Antiquity: for here even old Rome is commended by
Protestants, and produced for the condemnation of this new Rome; which is new,
more by alteration of her profession and customs, than of her edificies and
situation. Yet gladly would we know what this their Arithmeticall computation
may mean.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The Church of Rome being then thus cleared from all change of doctrine (at the
least concerning any needful article of faith, which is the only point now
pertinent and questionable) during as well the first 440 years after Christ, as
also the other thousand years now last past: there remains only to be
examined, the interim of those 160 years which passed between the said first
440. and the said other last 1000 years; in which mean time, if no such
supposed change was, then does it hereof unavoidably follow, that as the Church
of Rome at first received and professed the right faith, so likewise she does
yet still to this day continue and preserve the same.

The matter being as then (even from the testimonies of our learned
adversaries) made thus issuable, and plainly deduced to this certainty or
narrow compass of time: we have here often provoked them to give example or
instance of this their supposed change in the Roman Church during the said
mean time of 160 years.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing the Apologists singular curiosity in the
weauing up of their former ends.
SECT. 4.
5 A Philosopher did call sophistry, (which is an unsound, but witty
subteltie) a spiders web, fine, but thin, wouen curiously, but easily broken:
and such like may this workmanship of the Apologists seem to be, whilst that
they hemme Protestants within so narrow a compass, as is the interim of an
hundred and sixty years, charging them to prove therein all the Innouations
which they have objected against the Romish Church.

6 For first, Protestants, in oppugning doctrines which they call new, and not
Catholic, (that is, not universally received as necessary points of faith,)
are so far from suffering the limitation of the first 440 years, that they
give the Romanists the scope of the first 500 or 600 years, as our Adversaries
themselves do acknowledge: for D. Stapleton writing of the opinion of Luther,
Calvin, and Melancthon, says, that Quare Luthe^u^ ipse in nouissimis suis
libellis, vt in capt. Babylon. Caluinus quoque passim in Prophetas, Melancthon
etiam locis communibus primis editis, primos tantum quin gentos, aut ad sammam
sexcentos annos veritati concedunt. Stapleton. prompt. Cathol. ser. 4. Hebd. 4.
page 173.
they did yield unto the trial of truth, by the testimony of Antiquity, for
the space of the first five of six hundred years. Master Campian a Jesuit,
reporting the challenge of Bishop Jewel for the maintenance of those articles,
which he then propounded for Catholic, says, that he appealed unto the
judgment of Antiquity for the first Johannes Iuellus, Antesignanus
Caluimanorum, Angliae Catholicos, ad D. Pauli Londinensium, incredibili
^actantia la^essi^it, mu^ catis per hypocrisin and imploratis Patr^bus,
quicunque intra salutis annum sexcentesimum claruissent. Campian. rat. 5. p. 41.
six hundred years: and so likewise does their Jesuit Sacroboscus expound D.
Whitaker his defense, Sed fo^te respondebit Whitakerus quan ^o ipse concessit
Ecclesiam Romans puram, pia^ Christianam primis sexcentis annis, id se non
intellexisse simpliciter and absolute, ita vt nullum genas corrupt. lae in
aliqua part doctrinae locum habuerit in ea, sed tantum comparatione tacta ad
lequentia secula in quib is euasit corruptissima, and facta est Antichristiana.
Sacroboscus Defens. Decret. Conc. Trid. part 3. cap. 2. page 213.
Granting (says he) the Church of Rome to have continued pure for the space of
600 years, which he meant comparatively, in respect of the most corrupt state
of the Church of Rome, as it is now. And so indeed the meaning must be, to wit,
that the doctrines controuerted were not held in the prefined time of
Antiquity, as now they are in the Church of Rome: as our former discourse has
proved, and the sequel will more fully confirm.

7 Secondly, their passage from the days of S. Gregory (who lived within the
first 600 years) unto these present times, (which is the period of a thousand
years following) for the unviolable continuance of their now Romish faith, is
praecipitare, non descendere; an issue void of consent, and a reckoning (as we
say) without their host, as both by the examination of the In the first book.
judgment of S. Gregory, and of the former Throughout the second book.
Antiquity, has bin demonstrated: yet, as though the poor remainders of the
160 years, coming between Gregory and the former Antiquity, were the
parenthesis, wherein our proof of their alterations must necessarily be
included, they proceed to play upon this string saying:

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
In full liscouerie of which point, we will bri^fly urge three special reasons
next ensuing. As first, seeing the Scriptures do witness to us, as well that
Christ has placed in the Church Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, 13.
Pastors and Doctors, (to continue) to the consummation of Saints, until we

Christ's true Church must ever continue; but the true Church she neither is nor
can be, if she fail so much in duty, as to suffer so many supposed errors to
assault and invade her children, without some open defense and resistance to
the contrary: Therefore so many and so important doctrines, as Merit of works,
Prayer to Saints, Free Will, Real presence, adoration of Christ in the
Sacrament, Sacrifice of the Mass, the unmarried life of Priests, and so many
other more such like, could never (supposing they were errors) have in so small
a compass as of those said 160 years, been brought to have been as then begun
and publicly professed by the Roman Church, without great difficulty of
resistance and open reprehension of some one or other godly, and in some part
of the true Church. The examples These examples are yet extant, and to be found
in Irenaeus in libro aduer^us haereses. And in Epiphanius and Augustine, in
their several books against heresies.

plentiful demonstration herein.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Showing the Apologists error in the whole.
SECT. 5.
8 Herein is a commixture and confusion of cases, which ought to have been
distinguished, concerning both the subject and the object of controversies. The
subject of Antiquity is the Church: which is sometime taken for the universal
company of professors, sometime for one or other particular Church of ancient
times; and we know that diverse particular Churches (otherwise orthodoxall)
have had their blemishes, which ought not to be imputed unto the Church
universal.

9 Secondly, in the cause, which is the object of controversy, they should
have distinguished doctrines fundamental, the denial whereof does exclude men
from salvation, and disanulleth the name of the Church in the gainsaiers (such
as were defended by the now mentioned Valentintans, Manichees, Ar^ans,
Eutychians, Nestorians, and such like) from the errors which were not
absolutely fundamental, but may consist with a possibility of grace, so long
as they are not possessed with a wilful contradiction against the known light
of the truth.

10 Again, some errors are propounded only as probable opinions, some as
necessary positions and conclusions. In the first, the Church wherein they are,
gives a liberty unto men to dissent, and consequently a security to remain
in such a Church: the other binds and constrains a belief, and may not be
allowed against a man's conscience.

11 Lastly, some points were then newly invented by some particular men, which
ought to be discerned from other doctrines, which were generally professed of
almost all. By these so reasonable and requisite considerations our Authors
alleged by the Apologists, have been freed from detractions, and the now
religion of Romanists confuted in the above specified articles, concerning
Scriptures, Sacraments, private Mass, Free Will, Merit, Justification, manner
of Worship, and (besides many others) in Popedom it self.

12 To conclude, seeing there is scarce any one point in controversy between
us and Rome at this day, which we are not able to prove to be orthodoxall and
true, by the express testimonies of diverse Romanists of principal esteem in
their Church, both before and since the coming of M. Luther, as, throughout the
particular Treatises in this Appeal, has been amply confirmed, we think that
this their importunate seeking of a note of resistance must not a little
derogate either from the Apologists learning, or modesty: for why should they
exact notes of opposition by Protestants unto their doctrines, which they may
find usual in the worthiest professors of their own Church. One point yet
more.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The like examples also of the very foresaid 160. years now in question
afford no less evidence hereof, for even as then were contradicted for their
several opinions, to us yet at this day discerned and known, not only the

some Popes of Rome, as will hereafter appear. But scuto prius, we must first
defend our selves from the imputations of heresies, before we may attempt to
accuse others.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.

But also (which argues this matter most inuincibly and clearly for us, and
against our adversaries) sundry heretics for their then private and singular
denying (as Protestants now do) sundry points of our now professed Catholic
faith; the undoubted examples whereof, are many, and by our very adversaries
acknowledged. So even in, or (which is more strong) next before the beginning
of the said 160. years, was (as is confessed) the denial of prayer and
offering sacrifice for the dead, and of our appointed fasts, condemned as
singular in Hereof see Aug. haer. 53. and Epiphanius haer. 75. ante med. And M.
Fulke in his answer to a counterfeit Catholic, page 44 fine. and 45. initio,
confesses this, saying, I will not dissemble that which you think the
greatest matter; Aerius taught that Prayer for the dead was unprofitable, as
witness both Epiphanius and Austine, which they count for an error: Also he
taught that fasting days are not to be observed. And see this confessed in
like manner by Pantalcon in Chronographia, page 28 initio.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the testimony of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
Heresy is the Helen of Greece, engendring dissension for some carnal
respect; the Devils concubine, conceiving deformed shapes of error; an Adder,
writhing it self into perplexed senses and contradictions; and an Ape,
imitating only the terms of truth. Both Protestants and Romanists would be
loath to be patte^ned by these Hieroglyphics: we are now to try them both by
their own certain scantlings. And first of the Protestants.

2 Protestants are called in question, in the name of the Aerians, for not
praying for the souls departed: whereunto we have answered See above lib. 4.
ca. 12.. 2 and 3.
heretofore.

objected by our Adversaries: unto whom (that our answer may be more
acceptable) we first propound that aduertisememt which their own Cardinal
Tolet gives them, concerning the state of Gods Church under the old law:
Aduettendum est, in huius leiunij declarationem, olim in veteri lege
frequentissimum fuisse vsum ieiunandi, vt constat ex tota Scriptura, Lege, and
Prophetis, and historijs: nullu^ tamen tempus ieiunij indictum fuit a Lege, nec
tale p^aeceptum in ea fuit, sed ieiunia aut sponte in poemtentiam peccatorum,
aut in carnis mortificatione^, aut ad i^am Dei placandam assumebantur, aut
aliquando ab ipsis maioribus Iudaeorum iniungebantur, maxim temporibus
angustiae and tribulationis, aut alijs de causis. Sic ieiunabant Discipuli
Iohannis. -- At vero in Ecclesia nostra habemus ie^^niorum praec^pta, tempora,
and form^ eo^u^ praescriptam: na^ obseruamus ex praescripto Ecclesiae ieiunia
multa, Vigilias, quatuor Tempora, and Quadrages^mam, quae ab Apostolis ipsis
ottum habet. Haec ieiunia Christus eo tempore, quo cum suis Discipulis
conuersatus est, non indixit eis, nec ipsi ieiunia obse^uabant. Toletus Ies.
and Card. Com. in ^uc. 5. Annot. 70. page 374
Wherein although (says he) there was a frequent use of fasting, yet was there
not appointed any set-fast. How then? Their fasts were then undertaken either
voluntarily, by private men, for the mortifying of the flesh, etc. or else,
they were commanded by their Elders in the times of some great and public
extremity, or upon some special causes. But what now? But we have in our
Churches (says he) prescribed unto us both the times and forms of our fasts,
which Christ in his days did not ordain, such as a^^ the Vigils, four
Embers, and Lent-fast.

4 In the next place the doctrine of Protestants would be examined. Ieiunium
commune ad disciplinam, de qua nunc tractamus, pertinet, quoties de re aliqua
magna Deo supplicandum est: ieiunium vna cum oratione indicere expediret, vt
Scripturae ostendunt, Act. 13. Nehem. 1. Hoc alacriores ad pre^andu^ reddimur;
imminente aut grassante vlla calamitate, Pastorum officium est, ho^tari ad
ieiunium Ecclesiam, quo simpliciter i^am Dei deprecentur; hoc Dei gloriae and
publicae aedificationis interest, tum etiam nobis ipsis vtile and saluta^e.
Caluinus Institut. lib. 4. cap. 12.. 19.
A common or public fast (says Calvin) joined with prayers, is behooffull
for the Church, whereunto the Pastor is to exhort, whenever there is any
special cause to offer supplication unto God; as for example, in danger of
some great calamity: because hereby our prayers may become more fervent, our
souls more humbled, and the wrath of God more easily pacified. We have heard
of the doctrine of Luther, who allowed See above lib. 2. cap. 24. sect 7.
private fasts for the taming of the insolency of the flesh; and public also,
whether they be politic, for the good of a commonwealth, or spiritual,
either upon extraordinary occasions, or else at the set times before the feasts
of Easter, Pentecost, and the day of our Lords nativity. In brief, their own
Cassander reports the Protestants general opinion in their Confession in
Saxony, In Confessione Saxonica; -- in tertio genere collocantur eae
Traditiones, de rebus indifferentibus, quibus accedit opinio cultus, meriti,
aut necessitatis; quae opinio accedens ex Adiaphoris faciat impias; quare illas
esse violandas, vt opinio illa corrigatur. Ita a Philippo in Romans 14. exempla
ponuntur, delectus ciborum, statuta ieiunia etc. -- Quid qu^d Lutherus and
Bucerus (Protestantium) princi^es ape^te scribunt, se, publicae pacis causa
(huiusmodi) caeremonias and Traditiones communiter obseruare velle, his
conditionibus, vt doctrina Euangelij de Iustificatione gratuita per fidem
Christi sincere tradatur, nec in illarum traditionum obseruatione iustitia and
fiducia salutis collocetur. Cassander Consult. art. 15. page 104. and 111.
wherein they publicly showed their willingness to observe the set-fasts, and
other such like Traditions, yet so, as not to place any opinion of merit in
such obseruances, nor obscure thereby the doctrine of our free justification by
faith in Christ Jesus. Which is acknowledged by their Jesuit Philippus
Melancthon non negat ieiunij, and rerum indifferentium obseruationem posse
homini prodesse, and conducere ad cultum Dei, non tamen inquit immediate, sed
mediate: facit enim ieiunium vt homo sit aptior ad fundendas preces, in quibus
est cultus Dei. Tererius Ies. comm. in Romans cap. 14. disp. 3. number. 20.
Pererius to have been also the doctrine of Melancthon.

5 Now then, fasts are either private, or public: but our question is of the
public; which are either Ecclesiastical, or politic: but the objection
intends only the Ecclesiastical. These are appointed either upon
extraordinary occasions, (as in the case of common danger and extremity,) or
upon ordinary course. If therefore the Aerians thought only that the Church
might disanull the set fasts, or prefer the occasional fasts before them,
herein they could not be called heretics; because both many such like
Traditions (which were in our Adversaries judgment Apostolical,) have been See
above, lib. 2. cap. 25 sect. 10.
abolished by the Romanists themselves: and also the example of the Church of
God under the law, has commended unto us the excellency of the fasts which are
occasionally appointed. * See above, lib. 2. cap. 24. sect. 5. 6.


6 But if the Aerians abhorred (as they did) such circular set-fasts, so, as to
think the appointment of them heretical, and their use impious, taking
occasion thereby to make a schism in the Church: then Protestants (as has
been proved) are no more Aerians, in condemning the necessary use of such
fasts, than the Romanists are Protestants, in avoiding their accidental *
abuses: among whom many must necessarily fall upon the reprehension of their
own Jesuit Pererius: Quartum genus abstinentiae hodie colunt multi peruersa
ratione, -- quippe vel errore opinionis existimant summam perfectionis
Christianae in vnius abstinentiae cultu, and exercitatione continen, vel
hominum laudem aucupantur, -- vt incautis and simplicibus falsa sua dogmata
persuadeant: vel denique cum deficiat illos prudentia, sine modo abstinentiam
tractant, scilicet, magno rerum v^iliorum and meliorum impedimento ac
detrimento. Perer^^^ ^omm. in Dan. c. 1. lib. 1. page 28.
There is a kind of abstinence (says he) which many affect upon a perverse
respect, either placing the chief degree of Christian perfection in this kind
of worship, or thereby seeking the praise of men, or else so exceeding the just
measure, that their fasts become hindrances unto more profitable exercises.

CHAP. II. Of two Romish articles, Invocation of Saints, and worshipping of
their Relickes.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
So also was the denial of prayer to Saints, and worshipping of Saints,
Relics condemned likewise as then in Hie^on. contra Vigilantium c 2. and 3.
And M. Fulke confesses this likewise, vbi supra, page 46. paulo ante med.
saying: Last of all Vigilantius shall be brought in, who wrote against
Invocation of Saints, superstition of Relickes, and other Ceremonies: him
Hierome reproves. and vide Centur. 4. col. 1250. line 45: And Osiander in
Epitom. Cent. 4. l. 4. page 506. ante med. And see this further confessed by
C^ispinus in his di^course o^ the estate of the Church, page 131. post med.
Vigilantius.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: In the first point, the testimonies of their
Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
THE Author, in whom this pretended heresy was rooted, is Vigilantius; the
witness from whom the accusation is derived, is S. Jerome; the Adversaries
upon whom the same is fastened, are the Protestants, lastly, the accusers by
whom it is enforced are the Romanists: these four being duly examined will
give us cause to mislike in the Apologists a fourfold defect.

2 For first, Vigilantius is not challenged by S. Hierome in any one syllable,
for the article of our Invocation of Saints: but only for saying, Dicis in
libello tuo, quod dum viuimus mutuo pro nobis orare possumus; pos^quam autem
mortui fuerimus, nullius sit pro alio exaudienda oration: praesertim cum
Martyrs vltione^ sui sanguinis obsecrantes, impetra^e non quiuerint. Hieron.
tom. 2. lib. 2. aduersus Vigilant. And again: Si Apostoli and Martyrs adhuc
in corpore constituti, possunt orare pro caeteris, quando pro se adhuc debe^t
esse solliciti, quanto magis post coronas, victorias, and triumphos? Ibid.
verbis seqq.
The prayers which the Saints make for the living, are not heard of God. This
their Cardinal acknowledges, who, not finding any mention of Invocation in S.
Hierom his exception against Vigilantius, is glad to strain it out by force of
Docuit Vigilantius orationes mortuorum pro alijs non exaudiri, ex quo sequitur
eos frustra inuocari. Bellar. lib. 4. de no^is Eccles. c. 9.. 13. Vigilantius.
This consequence does prove, that Vigilantius thought that Saints were not to
be inuocated: but it does not prove that S. Hierome reprehended him for denying
Invocation; or that S. Hierome himself defended the Invocation of Saints.
consequence, which for lamenesse is called a flat non sequitur. This argues
their first defect, which is an ignorance of the exception taken against
Vigilantius.

3 Secondly, S. Hierome, to prove that the Saints departed pray for the living,
does first endeavor to show that they know the state of the living: and to
manifest their knowledge, he affirms, that they are conversant with men:
reasoning thus: Tu Apostolis vincula inijeis, vt vsque ad die^ iudicij
teneantur custodia, nec sint cum Domino suo, de quibus scriptu^ est, Sequuntur
agnum quocunque vadit: Si agnus vbique, ergo hi, qui cu^ agno sunt, vbique esse
credendi sunt: and cum diabolus and daemones toto vagentur in orb, and
celeritate nimia vbique praesentes sunt, etc. Hieron. aduers. Vigilant. loco
supra citato.
If the Lamb (Christ Jesus) be euery-where, they who are said to follow the
Lamb wheresoever he goes, are to be thought to be also euery-where. But this
property of being euery-where, being essential unto the divine nature,
Hieronymus aduers. Vigilant. dicit, Angelos propter celeritatem naturae,
quodammodo esse vbique: -- Sed ad cognoscendas preces, quae codem tempore fiunt
in diuersissimis locis, non sufficit celeritas, sed requiritur vera vbiquitas,
quam nec Angelorum, nec hominum spiritibus conuenire credimus. Bellar. lib. 1.
de beat. Sanct. cap. 20.. Alij dicunt. Observe, that word quodammodo is not in
S. Hierome.
cannot be incident (as their Cardinal Bellarmine truly testifies) unto
Angels or unto any created spirit. Wherefore the former assertion of S. Jerome
our Adversaries will not allow without some qualification: which their
Cardinal applies by adding a Quodammodo; and their Jesuit Hieronymus aduersus
Vigilant. sic: Si agnus vbique, ergo hi, qui cum agno sunt, vbique esse
credendi sunt. Del'rio Ies. disquis. Magic. part. 2. lib. 2. q. 26. Sect. 5. n.

appear a second defect.

Of the Tenet of Protestants and Romanists in this point of the Saints prayers.
SECT. 2.
4 Thirdly, concerning Protestants their Cardinal See above lib. 2. cap. 12.
Sect. 1. And their Iodocus Coccius does note Luther thus professing in his
book de 10. praecept. Quid aliu^ sunt Sancti qua^ guttae roris in cincinnis
sponsi? Et in resp. ad Louaniens. Non negaui vnquam etc. Et Oecolam. pad.

The examples (excepting one) which he alleges to the contrary, are either
violently strained, or objected (as these are) by them who were adversaries
unto Protestants.
has confessed that they grant, that the Saints do pray for us, although not
in particular (and therefore are not to be inuocated,) yet notwithstanding in
general, and consequently are heard of God. See now these different
co^plexions; Vigilantius said that Saints departed are not heard of God, and
that therefore they pray not for the living; Protestants grant that they pray to
God for the living in general, and therefore are heard of God: whence arises a
note of their third defect, in not discerning the difference between
Vigilantius and Protestants, to be as much as saying and gainesaying.

5 Fourthly, the Romanists lay for the ground sole, yea and for the sole ground
of the Invocation of Saints, this principle, Saints do understand our prayers:
otherwise, they would except against the direct Invocation of Saints: wherefore
the arch-question is, how the Saints departed do understand the prayers of the
living: whether (as our Adversaries themselves conceive and teach) by hearing,
or else by seeing.

6 If by hearing, then is it either directly and immediately from the parties
themselves, or else by the relation of some Angels. But Quidam dicunt eos
cognoscere ex relatione Angelorum, qui nunc ad coelos ascendunt, nunc inde ad
nos descendunt: quam rationem inijcit B. Augustinus. Et,
not by the relation of Angels (says their Cardinal,) although S. Augustine
do intimate this, because the Angels are not in themselves capable of the
prayers of men's thoughts; Alij dicunt Sanctorum animas sicut etiam Angelos,
mira quadam celeritate naturae quodam modo esse vbique, and per se audire
preces supplicantium, quam rationem videtur habere B. Hieron. in lib. co^tra
Vigilant. Sed neutra est sufficiens. -- Et ad cognosce^das preces, etc. B^llar.
lib. 1. de beat. Sanct. cap. 20.. Alij dicu^t. See. vlt. lit. d.
nor by their own presence with them that pray; for then must they be every
where, which is a property only belonging unto God. And yet this manner of
understanding, by their presence, is the only kind acknowledged by S. Hierome.

7 If by seeing, this must be (as they teach) either by a vision in Alij dicunt
Sanctos videre in Deo omnia a principio suae beatitudinis, quae ad ipsos aliquo
modo pertinent, and proinde etiam orationes nostras ad se directas. Ita docent
Greg. Thomas, Cai^tan. Estque probabilis haec sententia. --
God himself, as it were in a glass, or else by Alij postremo dicunt, Sanctos
non videre in verbo orationes nostras a principio suae beatitudinis, sed solum
tunc reuelari ^is a Deo orationes nostras, quando ^as fundimus. Bellar. ibid..
Alij dicunt.
Revelation from God. The first is defended by some Romanists, as See the
l^tter, ^
more probable: but See the letter, ^
denied by others, as untrue. The second is proved to be Atque ex his duabus
prior videtur simpliciter probabilior.
less probable by their own Cardinal, both Quia si indigerent Sancti nou^
reuelatione, Ecclesia non diceret it a audacter omnibus Sanctis, Orate pro
nobis: sed peteret aliquando a Deo. vt eis re^^laret preces nostras. Deinde,
non posset reddiratio tam facile, cur Sancti muocentur, and a^te aduentum
Christi non inuocarentur. -- Etiamsi Sancti non viderent Deum, adhue possent
eis reuelari preces nostrae, sicut hic in ter^is reuelabantu^. Bellar. quo
supra.. Atque ex his.
because if the Saints received their knowledge by new Revelations from God,
the Church could not say so boldly unto them, Pray for us, before she should
pray unto God to reveal her prayers unto the Saints: and also for that there
can no reason be given, why the Church of the old Testament (wherein there were
Saints) did not invoke and call upon the Saints departed.

8 So now the Romanists have imposed upon Vigilantius a wrong state of a
question, viz. our praying unto Saints, in stead of the Saints praying for us.
Secondly, they violently apply it unto Protestants, who are acknowledged
adversaries unto that opinion of Vigilantius. Do they still press the
testimony of Hierome for proof of the Saints prayers for the living, and
notwithstanding reject his authority, where he teaches the manner of the
Saints Namely, by their personal presence. See above.
understanding of men's prayers made unto them? Finally whilst that they
endeavored to satisfy how the Saints do understand our prayers (without which
capacity they may not be inuocated) in propounding only four possibilities
thereof, they themselves in their several answers have disabled each one, and
may therefore be admonished not to contend against others, until first they be
reconciled unto themselves. But the articles and ioints of this Invocation we
have handled See above. lib. 2. cap. 12. and lib. 1. cap. 2. sect. 24.
heretofore, therefore now we pass from the Invocation of the persons of
Saints, unto the veneratio^ of their relics, showing

The Doctrine of Vigilantius in this point of Relics.
SECT. 3.
9 Vigilantius is charged by S. Hierome to wish the Relics of Saints to be
Dolet Martyrum reliquias precioso ope^iri velamine, and non vel pannis, vel
cilicio colligari, vel proijci in sterquilinium. And again. Qui reliquias

cast upon the dunghill, and trodden under foot, and for suspecting that they
had been idolatrously Quid necesse est, te (the words of Vigilantius) tanto
honor non solum honorare, verum-etiam adorare illud nescio quid, quod in
modico vasculo linteamine circumdatum adorando oscularis? S. Hierome answers
him:
adored: whom he therefore called a Quis, o insanum caput, Martyrs aliquando
adorauit? Hieron. quo supra.
Madbraine. Notwithstanding our Adversaries have been answered concerning this
point, that D. Fulke against the Rhemes Testament, super. Act. 19. 12.
Vigilantius was not condemned of heresy by the Church, although S. Hierome
did write so bitterly against him; who did write also against S. Augustine, and
Ruffinus, which yet were counted as good Catholics as he. As for Vigilantius,
neither by Epiphanius, Philastrius, Augustine, Theodoret, Isidorus, Damascenus,
Antiochus, or any other ancient writer, that gathered the Catalogue of
heretics and heresies that were before their time, is he once touched, or his
opinion against the immoderate estimation of relics condemned.

10 As for S. Hierome, he has incurred a censure, which requires in him
Vigilantius scripsit librum, in quo docebat non esse sic adorandas Martyrum
reliquias, nec ad horum sepulchra vigilandum, quod id temporis magna religione
fiebat a Christianis. In hunc ita conuitijs debacchatur Hieronymus, vt plus

less railing, and more reasoning for the continuance of night-vigils, which
some Christians then used at the graves or monuments of holy Martyrs in honor
of the Saints departed; which ( Error autem and culpa iuuenum, vilissim arumque

q^^ supra.
notwithstanding the abuses and follies that were occasioned thereby) he
pleaded for, and was therefore disliked not only of Vigilantius, but also of
Ecclesiastical persons of ancient times, who abhorring the superstition then
floating about those vigils, abolished all things in them, excepting their
names. Sure it is, that the reason which S. Hierome then conceived, has been
since confuted by S. Augustine, who proves from the Scripture of the old
Testament, that Sitana Patriarchae quid erga populum ex his procreatum ageretur
ignorauerunt, quibus Deo credentibus populus ipse de illor^^ stirpe promissus

The justification of Protestants, from the testimonies of their Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
11 From the former considerations we may conclude, that if Vigilantius spoke
simply against the relics of Saints, in contempt of them (as says their Impia
est opinio Vigilantij, qui Martyrs omni honor priuabat. Viues in Aug. de
ciuit. Dei. l. 8. c. 27.
Viues,) then will Protestants equally condemn him of impiety: but if (as
Hezechiah dealt with the 2. Reg. 18.
brazen Serpent, by breaking it in pi^ces, and casting it out of the way, lest
the people by stumbling upon it might fall into Idolatry) he sought that the
relics of Saints should be interred, rather than the Lord of Saints and
sanctify it self, should be dishonored: then was he no more an heretic for
burying the Saints relics, than the now Church of Rome will be thought
heretical, for In profestis magnorum dierum consueuerat Ecclesia vigilare and
ieiunare, and inprimis in Vigilia Paschae. -- De vigilijs in Sanctorum honorem
meminit Basilius, Hieron aduers. Vigilant. Innocentius Pont. Bernardus.
Caeterum quoniam paulatim occasion nocturnarum vigiliarum ab^^us quidam

nocturnos conuentus, and vigilias proprie dictas intermittere, ac solum in

abolishing the ancient vigils of the Saints, because of the abuses and
impieties committed in them: seeing that S. Hierome did inueigh against
Vigilantius as well in the defense of vigils, as of relics. So now supposing
that Vigilantius rejected relics with an intent to dishonor the Saints, we
say with S. Hierome, he was a Mad-braine, and a Dormitantius: but conceiving
that he intended only the honor of God, by expelling Idolatry, then may we
wish that S. Hierom had bin a Vigilantius in the case of the relics of Saints,
as well as the Romanists have been in the point of their vigils. Yet one thing
more,

Concerning the burying of the bones of the Saints.
SECT. 5.

calling the relics of Saints the peoples Vigilantius multa docu^t, 1.

seduction, and wishing their bones buried in the earth: as though hereby they
had intended to abolish all memory of the Apostles, Martyrs, and Saints. Which
is the unconscionable censure of their Cardinal, seeing that Protestants who
embrace all Evangelical and Ecclesiastical history, the life of their
memory, cannot but reverence and adore the memory of their lives. Luther
accounts the Non reclamo Diuorum ossa sancta esse, sed hoc detesto^, quod

13 Let the question now be, whether Calvin do more justly accuse the
Romanists Christianorum est, Sanctorum corpora in sepulchris suis relinquere,

for digging up the bones of Saints, that they may worship them; or their
Cardinal Bellar mine condemn Protestants for See above at the letter i.
burying them: and let God and man decide the point.

14 They object out of the old Testament, the Moses ossa (Exodus 13.) Iosephi
iamdiu mortui honorifice secum ex Aegypto in terram promissionis transtulit:
ergo transtatio ossium Sanctorum non est superstitiosum and nouum, Bellar. l.
2. de Reliq. Sanct. c. 3. initio.
honorable translation of the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and conclude,
that therefore this office of translating men's bones is not to be judged new,
and superstitious. Vainly and sophistically argued; for we question not so
much about the act of translation, but concerning the end, whereof their Jesuit
Ossa Iosephi, quae tulerant filij Israel de Aegypto in terram promissionis,
sepeliuerunt in Sichem, vt habetur Josh. cap. vlt. Pererius in Genesis c. 50.
Peterius, yea the Corpora sidelium in templis and locis sacris sepeliuntur:
ita olim Jacob and Joseph Patriarchae, in terra Aegypti mortui, in terra
promissionis sepeliri voluerunt. Bellar. l. 2. de Purg. c. vlt.. Tertio.
Cardinal himself can thus witness, that the bones of Joseph were translated
out of Egypt into the land of promise, (but) to be buried in Sichem. The
ancient Patriarchs dying were buried, and so Genesis 29 etc.
gathered unto their fathers. Tobias is commended for Tob. 2.
burying the bodies of the dead, which lay martyred in the streets: the body of
John Baptist was sought for by his Disciples, who Matthew. 14. 12.
buried it: the body of Christ (who is the resurrection and the life of the
dead, and unto whom all martyis were martyrs and witnesses,) was begged, but
that it might be Matthew. 27.
buried. If the innumerable examples of holy men could be possibly recounted,
they would teach us to sing of the act of burial of their bodies, according
unto that song of the Psalmist, Psalm. 149.
Such honor belongs unto all his Saints. Thus much from God.

15 Consonant hereunto are the voices of Antiquity concerning their bones the

their insepulta sepultura, which is, their reservation of them in coffers and

example of God) Mosis corpus absconditum erat, ne adoraretur; -- quia populus

Cardinal Bellarmine,) peradventure were but few. Which does as well implie,
that peradventure (a term indifferent between two opposites) they were many.
Nevertheless if it shall pass with a peradventure, yet their own Authors
have testified of the Romanists, that See above, lib. 2. cap. 12.. 12.
many Christians worship Saints with the same honor, which they give unto God
himself. Thus much, if we suppose their relics to be true.

16 But if the relics be false, then may their worship be truly called a
seduction. To this purpose Erasmus in his See the Catalogue of Authors before

If S. Hierome (says he) did so reprove simple women (for certain
superstitions,) whose infirmity of sex might have deserved some pardon, what
would he say in these days, to see euerie-where set forth in ostentation the
virgin Mary's milk, and so many pieces of the Cross of Christ, (which if they
should be gathered together, might sink a ship?) Here they show us S. Francis
his Coule, there the Virgins peticote, one-where S. Ans comb, in another place
Joseph's breeches, and (which is a thing uncertain) the prepuce of Christ,
which they adore more religiously than Christ himself. Neither are these (says
he) c^mended unto the vulgar people, by way of indulgence, to satisfy their
affections, but they are made the chief point of religion, through the
covetousness of Priests, the hypocrisy of Monks, and the sottishness of the
people. This witness saw, and said.

17 Besides, for the uncertainty of true miracles, and the certainty of
superstition used in their worship, their own See above.
Consultor advised them rather to effect a zealous imitation of the glorious
relics, the vertu^s of those Saints, than to affect the practiced veneration
of their earthly remnants. And indeed, why should not the Church be as zealous
in abrogating the worship of their supposed relics, for avoiding of idolatry,
as anciently they were in abolishing of religious banquets, used at the
monuments of Martyrs, for the prevention of August. lib. 8. de ciuit. cap. 27.
Quicunque epulas suas eo deferunt, quod quidem a Christianis melioribus non

was misliked by S. Hierome, and S. Hierome by the learned of his time, and
Protestants by Romanists, and Romanists by themselves: in the next place are we
to speak

CHAP. III. Of another accusation against Protestants, concerning the
worshipping of Images.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
In the same times were condemned in like manner the denial of Images in
Functius (a Protestant writer) in libro 7. Commentariorum in praecedent.
Chronologiam, at Anno Christi. 494. confesses saying, Porro is Xenaya^ primus
in Ecclesia bell^m c^ntra imagines excitauit. And Nicephorus in hist. Eccles.
l. 16. cap. 27. says, Xenayas iste primus (o audacem ^nimam and o^impudens)
vo^em illam euontuit, Christi and eorum qui illi placuere imagines venerandas
non esse. And see also hereof Cedrenus in compendio histor.
Xenayas.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First concerning the witness produced against
Xenayas.
SECT. 1.
TO persuade us that such an heretic as one Xenayas had spoken against the
worshipping of Images, and that he was for this cause judged an heretic, it
requires a witness beyond all exception. But the first and only witness
whom their Xenaias Persa pa^am asseruit, Christi and Sa^ctorum imagines non
esse venerandas. Testis est Nicephorus lib. 16. cap. 27. Bellar. lib. 4. de
not^^ Eccles. cap. 9.. 18.
Cardinal did produce, is Nicephorus, whom also the Apologists do here assume,
and by whom they seek to prove the not worshipping of Images to have been an
ancient heresy: but only by Nicephorus, of whom their own Cardinal Baronius
has admonished his Reader to take heed, because Sic Nicephorus, quod plane
falsum est. (De tempore Matthew. Euang.) Baronius Tom. 1. Anno 41. number. 16.

less ancient. And Posseumus does infirm his authority in Ecclesiastical
relation: (...) vt tanquam Ecclesiasticus scriptor fidem faciat, etc. Apparat.
tit. Cedrenus.
Nicephorus (says he) has taken some things out of a muddie fountain: and
again, It is false which Nicephorus says: and the third time, Nicephorus gave
credit unto a feined story: and yet again, this conuinceth Nicephorus of a
lie. Shall a witness, so singularly convicted for a lier, be approved for a
singular witness of truth, especially in the point of worshipping of Images,
whereunto he himself was superstitiously addicted? and therefore would (if in
any thing) dispense with his pen, to feign something for the countenancing
hereof. The next point is

The justification of Protestants, from the judgment of Antiquity: by the
testimony of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 In the year 305, in the Council of Eliberis, consisting of many Bishops
vncontrollably orthodoxall, See this confessed above, lib. 4. ca. 27. sent. 2.
(m)
the worshipping of Images (says their Senensis) was forbidden. And Epiphanius
(anno 395) was offended to see an See ibid. (n)
Image hanging at the door of a Chapel, and rent it: (which pious action a
Romanist forbear not to call Castro lib. ^^ntra Here Is. Tit. Imag^. And Walden
is call^ng it Zelum non ^ecundum scientiam. Tom. 3. cap. 57. See above, li. 4
ca. 27.
heretical.) How much more offended would he have been to have seen not one,
but innumerable; not pictures only, but statues; not hanging at the doors,
but standing on their pillars and altars?

3 And S. Hierome living about the same time, affirmed, that Con^essed above
lib. 4. cap. 27. sect. 2. k.
all the ancient Fathers (understanding, as we think, the Fathers of the
Christian Church) condemned the worshipping of Images. About the 400 year,
Images crept out of private men's houses, and went into the public Churches,
standing there, but yet in pictures only, not in statues, that they might
serve only for an historical remembrance, and not for religious adoration:
which in the 600 year was Confessed above lib. 1. cap. 2. sect. 25. and 26.
forbidden by S. Gregory. Descend we yet almost 200 steps lower, unto the
Reuerendiss. Cardinalis Baronius eam sententiam veriorem esse iudicat, qua
afferitur, quod Patres Francof. Consilij, mendacijs and imposturis authorum

for approving the idolatrous worship of Images: accordingly as the Emperor Hoc

offerantur. Carolus Magnus de Imag. lib. 4. cap. 18. which Hincmarus auerred to

Charles the Great had done.

4 What heresy then shall we call this, whereof Protestants are now accused,
and wherein the Fathers of so good and great antiquity reach unto us their
right hand of fellowship? and not they only, but also the whole nation of the
Confessed above, lib. 3. cap. 16. sect. 2
Jews, both before and since they were the peculiar and holy people of God,
who are confessed to have abhorred all worship of Images.

5 Finally, consider the cause that Protestants had to reject the worship of
Images: which is acknowledged to have been just, to wit, not only the Qui
saeuierunt in Diuorum imagines, non pror^us absre concitati sunt ad cum zelum,
licet immodicum, mea quidem sententia. Nam horribile crimen est idololatria,
hoc est, simulachrorum cultus: qui tametsi iam olim sublatus est emoribus

Confessed above, lib. 1. and lib. 2.
many, who were deeply plunged in that sin of sins; and so must the
doctrine of Protestants be found more than justifiable. We are called out of
their Churches, to look into their Monasteries, and to answer unto

CHAP. IIII. An accusation, concerning the Monastical profession of voluntary
poverty.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And the denial of voluntary poverty and monastical profession, in Hierome
contra Vigilantium prope sinem, says: Quod autem asseris eos melius facere qui
vt untur rebus suis, and paulatim fructus possessionum suarum pauperibus
di^^dunt, quam ill^s qui possessionibus venundatis s^mel omnia largiuntur; non

by Crispinus in his book of the estate of the Church page 131. and 132.
Vigilantius and others In like manner is lanuarius for this like doctrine
reproved by S. Austine, sermon. 49. ex diuersis cap. 1. and Iustus is for the
same reproved by Gregory, lib. 4. Dial. cap. 55. And see further hereof Leo ep.
92. ad Rusticum. And Council. Chalcedon. cap. 7. and Austine ep. 89. ad
Hilarium, and Chrysostom l. aduersus vituperatores vitae moriasticae.


THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First expressing the doctrine of the Romanists.
SECT. 1.
HOw poor and miserable this objection is, which the Quarto Vigilantius
docuit, non expedire re^mquere omnia, and dare pauperibus, and ad religionem,
relicto seculo, properare. Ita resert Hieronymus in lib. contri Vigilantium.
Eade nunc omnia docent Sect^rij. Hellar. l. 4 d^ not is Eccles. cap. 9.. 13.
Vigilantius.
Romanists do usually urge for the priuiledging of their monastical poverty,
we shall better perceive after that they have taught us what is that
monastical poverty which they profess. Religio, vt hic a nobis accipitur,
sic definiri potest: Religio status est hominum ad perfectionem Christianam per
paupertatis, and continentiae, and obedientiae vota tendentium. Bellar. lib. 2.
de Monach. cap. 2. initio.
Areligious Order (say they) is a state of men tending unto perfection, by vow
of poverty, etc. Nota quarto non susticere ad religionem has tr^s virtutes,
nisi accedat votum, id est, sacra promissio Deo facta, qua quis astringit se
perpetu^ ita victurum. Religio enim est status quidam, status autem
significatrem immobilem and perpetuam, Ibid.. Nota. 4.
Which vow is made unto God, with promise to continue perpetually in that
state: the perfection whereof Haec perfectio (quae consistit in obseruatione
consiliorum, vt paupe: tatis etc.) necessaria est ad excellentiorem gradum
gloriae in regno coelorum comparandam. Idem ibid. cap 9.. Neque obstat.
consists in observation of the counsels (and not of the commandments) of
Christ: to this end, that it may be a necessary means of obtaining an higher
degree of glory in the kingdom of heaven. Upon which considerations, Deind
Ecclesia, cuius iudicium in rebus fidei est infallibile, probauit Monachorum
mendicantium paupertatem non solum esse licitam, verum and meritoriam Alsonsus
de Castro lib. 12. aduers. Haeres. Tit. De paupertate, Haeres. 3.
our Church (say they) which cannot err in any matter of faith, has allowed
the Order of begging Monks, as both lawful and meritorious.

nor hinder a man in the way unto life. For the poor Number. 15. 32.
stick-gatherer, and the L^c. 16. 19.

poor S. Augustine gives this caution, to know, that Pauper Dei in animo est,
non in sacculo. Aug. in Psalm. 131.
Gods almes-man is esteemed not by his beggerie, but by his humility.
Therefore the truly religious poverty must be discerned by the end.

3 The religious ends which can be imagined, why a man should make himself
nakedly poor, do sometimes concern the necessary passage unto eternal life:
and this is either common unto all Christians, or more peculiar unto some
conditions.

4 The common is called Duplicit^r constitui possit paupertas spiritus, alia in
voluntate and praeparatione animi per quam quis potius omnia rel^nquere, quam
Deum offendere, paratus est, quanquam interim actu nihil relinquat: alia vero

abdicationem, and effectum volu^tariae paupertatis. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 5.
tract. 4. page 24.
poverty of the spirit, which is, (as their Jesuit Salmeron confesses) when
a man is prepared and resolved (always in affection) rather to forsake all,
than to offend God; and, when the case so stands, does (in action) relinquish
all things, according to the general and perpetual vow of all that have been
baptized in the name of Christ Jesus; as was practiced by the ancient Memorat

he that esteems any thing as his portion without God, cannot have God for
his portion. Thus much of the necessary poverty. And now follows

An answer unto their great objection, for their kind of voluntary poverty.
SECT. 3.
6 The freely voluntary poverty which is undertaken for a more easy course
of godliness, is conceived of our Adversaries, to be either by living in a
society upon a community, or else in taking up a profession of stark
beggerie. One, and (in comparison) their only ground is that saying of Christ
unto the rich young man, (who said he had kept all the commandments, and was
desirous to know what was lacking unto him for the obt^ining of etern^ll life:)
Matthew. 19. 20.
If thou will be persect (says Christ) sell all that thou have, and give unto
the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven. Here they think that this
man had fulfilled the commandments, and therefore was now counseled to enter
into the state of perfection by a voluntary poverty, in selling all, and
giving it unto the poor.

7 Diverse answers may be applied unto this objection: the first is, that Haec
omnia custodiu^^ iuuentute mea. Matthew. 19. Hilarious comm. in Matthew. 19. Author
operis impe^fect^, hom. 33. Ambrose com. in Luc. 18. D. August. Epist. 89.

page 712. (...) 1. which may (...) Adu^rsarie^ (...), or k^pt not the (...)

the young man, saying that he had kept the commandments, lied, according unto
the judgment of Hilary, Ambrose, S. Augustine, Hierome, Bid, Theophtlact, and
other Greek Fathers; as they are cited by their Jesuit Maldonate: and so our
Saviors speech was not a counsel unto perfection, but rather a caveat to
t^ie, and teach him what had been his imperfection in not keeping the
commandments of God.

8 Secondly, relinquishing all, is either (...). 1. cap 2. sect. ^8.
habitual, in preparation of mind, upon necessary occasion; or else actual,
by a real departure. Now their Aquinas in the behalf of Bishops, who possess
goods, and convey them unto their assigns, answers concerning the same
Scripture, that V^letar quod statas religio^o^um sit perfect^or qu^m status
pral totum: Dominus ei dicit Matthew. 19. Sivis perfectus esse, vade, and vende
omnia quae habes, and da paupe^ibus, quod faciunt (...), non au^em ad hoc
tenentur Episcopi, dicitu^ enim 12. 9. 1. ^pi^^opi de ^ebus propri^^ and

religiosi sunt in perfectiori statu quam Episcopi. Responsi^n^, ^^cenda quod
ab^enunciatio prop^^a^um ^acultatum considerari potest vel secundum quod est in
actu, and sic in ea non consisti^ aslentialiter perfectio, sed est quodd^m
perfectionis instrumentum: and iam nihil sta^um perfectionis prohibet esse ^ine

manducando esse institiam, sed in aeq^ani^nitate tolerandi inopiam. Scio and
abundare, and (...) pati. Aquina^. 2. 2. qu. 184. Ad. 1.
the state of perfection may be, with out actual renuntiation. And indeed, the
want of habitual preparation of forsaking all (which ought to be perpetual in
all Christians) was notable in the young man, as it may seem to be verified by
the speech of Christ, saying unto him, One thing is awanting, even as may be
supposed, ^ the contempt of ^iches, a thing necessary unto man's salvation. And
by this construction it was not a volunta^ie, but a necessary ^elinquishment
which was required.

9 Notwithstanding, if, because Christ said, Go sell, and give; we shall
understand an a^^u ill renuntiation, yet the end of it was not only a degree
of gl^ry, which the Romanists make to be the proper effect of volunt^^ie
poverty, but it was eternal life it self. This appears, first, by the man's
desire, What shall I do to inherit eternal life? Secondly, by Christ's promise
of treasures in heaven, which is interpreted by S. Luke, Luc. 18. 18.
life: Thirdly, by the event of Christ's instructing him, to give all: for it is
said, He went away sorrowful, as being forlorn of life; for hope of
blessedness would have expelled sorrow. Potest intelligi vnum illud, quod
Dominus dicit deeste illi, necessa^ium fuisse ad salutem, decrat enim e^
contemptus diuitiarum. Iansenius, concord in cum l^cum.
Lastly, by Christ his inference, It is impossible for a rich man to enter (he
says not into an higher mansion in the kingdom) into the kingdom of heaven.
All which circumstances make it more than probable, that the matter of promise
was eternal life, and blessedness it self, which is the reward of
commandments; not only the degree of glory, which they call the reward of
counsels.

10 And why may not this, Go sell, and give, and follow me, be held for at
least an Evangelical and temporal commandment? For now when Christ showed
himself willing to ride upon this colt of an Ass, and to use him for a
disciple, it could not but be impiety in the yonker not to submit himself,
and all that he had unto the will of his Lord: neither did S. Chrysostom. in
Tit. 3. col. 1636. Vende omnia, etc.* Vides vt ideo praeceperit ei, vt Christum
sequeretur? quia enim pecuniae impedimenta sunt, id^irc^ dan das pauperibus
iussit. Although otherwhere otherwise.
Chrysostom, Hilary, calls it, Vt^le relinquendi seculi praeceptum: then ^e
says, H^bere, criminis non est, sed mod^s in haben (...) ret nendus, nam

Saluianus, forbear to call it a commandment.

11 Not, but that we allow the distinction of precept and counsel, but that
all Christians are not absolutely counseled to give all away; but to imitate
the merchant, who in a desperate tempest, rather casts all his goods over
boo^d, than he will hazard his life; and when the danger is less, he will
depart but with some part, reserving a portion for helping forward his
traffic: so the Christian seafaring man will upon an extremity rather
forsake all worldly profit, than endanger the shipwreck of faith, and a good
conscience. Nevertheless in the common course of his life (which is ordinarily
hazardous) will not be awanting to throw daily some of his goods into the salt
sea of other men's misery, for their relief, always so giving, that he may
always give. Now let us see

The Romish double error, in their pretense of poverty: from the judgment of
our Adversaries.
SECT. 4.
12 They teach a double kind of Monastical poverty, consisting in the
Consistit religrosa ac Monastica paupertas vel in abdicatione proprietatis and
dominij, and ^uris, vel possessionis, vel vsus f^uctus, vel vsus simplicis: cum
penes fratres vel religio^os sit vsus rei communis, Salmeron Tom. 5. Tract. 5.
ante finem.
renouncing of the dominion, possession, and property of their goods; yet in a
community enjoying the use of them: such as are the common sort of Monks. The
second is a forsaking both of the property, and of all use of riches; these
are called the Mendicants or begging Friars.

12 Concerning the former, Por^o Monachis non fuisse interdictam re^um suarum
possessionem, vel Augustinus est testis, lib. de Haeres. ad Quodvult Deum, ha^.
40. cuius haec sunt verba: Apostolici, inquit, qui se isto ^omine
arrogantissi^e vocauerunt, ^o quod in suam c^mmunionem non reciperent vt^^tes
coniugibus and resprop^^as poss^dentes, quales habet Catholica Ecclesia, and
Monachos, and Clericos pl^^mos. -- Non igitur ^^rum, si nihil de his meminerit
Hieronymus, quae nondum crant instituta. (...). in epist. Hieron. ad (...):
page 52.
Augustine is a sufficient witness, to prove that Monks in ancient times were
not forbidden to possess their own goods, who in his book of Heresies
shows, that both Monks, and Clergymen enjoyed both their possessions and
wives. We know that Platoes commonwealth of community was no state of
poverty, neither are the Romish Monasteries so poor pastures, but that the
old proverb may still pass for current, Desperatio facit Monachum, that is,
some men, for fear of poverty, desire the profession of monastical poverty.
All that therein do seek thereby a carnal ease and security, may be compared
unto the Ass which stood by Christ, but only with a disposition to feed at
the cratch. Again, some make the profession monastical, but a means unto
higher preferment, herein feining himself dead, with the Fox, that thereby he
may more easily catch the prey.

The second confessed error of a professed Romish poverty, which is peculiar
unto the Order of begging Friars.
SECT. 5.
14 How much less means have their Mendicants to cover the deformed
nakedness and unlawfulness of their sect, which they call a religious
profession of want, which is poor and yet proud ( Eccles. 6. 1.
an evil under the Sun,) seeking no worse predecessors of their Order, than
Christ and his Apostles? albeit their Jesuit Salmeron can witness, Multi sunt
pauperes Euangelici, qui non egent, vt constat de Christo loculos liabente, and
Apostolis missis ad praedicandum; numquid aliquid defuit? Et in primitiua
Ecclesia, Act. 4. neque quisquam egens erat inter eos. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 5.
Tract. 5.. Obijc^unt postremo.
that Neither Christ, nor the Apostles, being sent out without scrip or staff
etc. were in want: and in the primitive Church, when all things were made
common, distribution was made among them, according as every man had need.
Christ, indeed, Ioh. 4.
begged water at the well; but, as the Prophet 2. Reg. 2.
Helisaeus did beg oil of the Shunamite, and David the shewbread of 1. Sam. 21.
Abimelech: which proves no more a begging condition than Vnus and alt^^ actus
non facit piscatorem, sed continuatio and professo. Tolet. Ies. com in Luc. 5
once fishing does make a fisher; for when Judas said of the precious ointment,
Ioh. 12. 5.
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the
poor, his intent is noted; v^rs. 6.
This he spoke, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief,
and had the bag, and bare that which was given: hoping that the money would
come unto his fingering. Not obscurely signifying that the use of Christ his
bag was to give to the poor: Christ would sometime be a giver.

15 We yet further pursue them, in manifesting the iniquity of that
profession. Our Lord Christ Matthew. 633. Quae^te primu^ ^egnum Dei.] Christus
non omnino ve^ui^ caetera quae^ere, sed ita quaerere, vt illorum sollicitudo
nos a regno Dei quaerendo auertat; ita quaerere vt ijs seruire velimus: non
enim possumus duobus dominis serui^e, verse. 24. quaerere autem secundo loco
propter regnum Dei non vetuit, sed docuit. Nam in oratione Dominica praecepit
dicere, Adueniat regnum tuum; praecepit etiam dicere, Panem nostrum quotidianum
da, etc Maldonat. Ies. in hunc locum.
in commanding us to [seeke first the kingdom of God] did not altogether
forbid us from seeking other things (says their Jesuit Maldonate,) but in
those petitions of the Lords prayer, for Gods kingdom, and for our daily
bread, has taught us to seek the things of this world, so far as they may
be furthera^ces to his kingdom. And Cardinal Bellarmine in his Treatise de
Laicis, acknowledges Respondemus, tribulationem and persecutionem esse quidem
vtilem sed periculosam, and ideo non expetendam, sed tolerandam, cum aliter
fieri non potest: vnde Matthew. 6. iubemur orare, Et n^ nos inducas in
tentationem; and in 1. Tim. 2. Apostolus iubet orare pro Regibus, vt quietam
and tranquilla vitam agamus. Et B. August. l. 10. Confess. c. 28. dicit,
Miseri^s tolerandas, non amandas, nec desiderandas, uec petendas. Bellar. l. 3.
de Laicis, c. 17.. Sed respondemus.
Tribulation to be profitable, but yet perilous, and in that respect to be
necessarily suffered, but not voluntarily desired, because we are commanded to
pray thus, [Leade us not into temptation:] which he confirms by the
authority of S. Augustine. Wherefore seeing that extreme poverty is a
certain tribulation, and indeed a gulf of temptation; then are their begging
Friars yet to learn how to say the Lords prayer.

16 But why do we dispute? knowing that about the year 1254, many Gulielmus

17 Where our godly Reader will easily observe the slippery sleight of our
Adversaries, in exacting for proof of Romish declination, an open Resistance;
and if it happen that no Resistance can be shown against their novelties, then
are Protestants, for want of such proof, condemned for heretics: and if a
resistance be discovered, then they forthwith are called heretics, who did
resist. This is more then partiality. In the last place is to be unfolded

The Romish error of defense of Perfection, issuing from their own
contradictions.
SECT. 6.
18 Their first degree of Monastical poverty is that which is professed in
having the use of things in common: whereupon arises a question, whether the
state of Bishops, who possess lands and goods, and enjoy the propriety of
them, or rather of Monks, who deprive themselves hereof, be more perfect?
Whereof our Adversaries have thus determined: Tertius gradus est diligere Deum,
-- qua^tum potest creatura mortalis, quae a se remouit omnia diuini amoris
impedimenta, and totam se Dei obsequio consecrauit. Qui in hoc gradu versantur,
imperfecti sunt, respectu beatorum; sed perfecti. respectu altorum hominum,
etiam lustorum and piorum Et haec est perfectio de qua loquuntur Theologi. cum
dicunt starum Episcoporum esse statum perfectionis adeptae, and statum
Religioforum esse statum perfectionis acqu^ endae. Hoc enim interest inter
Episcopos and Religiosos, quod religiosi non tenentur continuo esse perfecti,
sed tantum (...) ad perfectionem: versantur enim in exercitatione virtutis, and
remotione impedimentorum: at Episcopi debent esse perfect^, id est, ad eum
gradum charitatis perue^isse, ad quem Religiosi per sua vota and exercitia
tendunt. Propte^ea in definitione diximus, Religionem esse statum hominum ad
perfectionem tendentium. Bellar. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 2.. Tertius gradus.
The state of Bishops (say they) is the more perfect, because in it perfection
is already achieved; and the state of the religious Monks is less perfect,
because they are but contending unto perfection. Thus whilst they have defined
perfection to consist in voluntary poverty, which is an See above Sect. 4.
alienation of all propriety of worldly goods, and yet do prefer the state
of Bishops, possessing wealth (and some also possessed thereof,) they do but,
in effect, contend to place perfection in no perfection.

19 Secondly, Imprimis Gregorius nonus, anno Dom. 1238 Constitutionem edidit,
qua omnibus Ecclesiarum Praefectis praecepit, vt Mendicantes rem diuinam
facere, conciones habere, ac sacras peccatorum confess ones audire, libere
permittant: -- Eandemque Constitutionem innouanit Innocent 4. anno 1245. qui
tamen postea prohibuit ab his omnibus Ministerijs Mendicantes. Azor. Ies.
Instit. Moral. part. 1. lib. 13. cap. 2. initio.
Pope Gregory the ninth (anno 1238.) did first ordain the begging Monks to
preach, and administer the Sacraments; which was afterward confirmed (anno
1243.) by Pope Innocentius the fourth: who himself, not long after, did forbid
them to exercise any such functions. Yet the reason whereby the lesuite does
excuse the Mendicants for not laboring, is, Septimo quaeritur, cur
Mendicantes, viribus alioqui praediti, manibus minime laborent, cum ex
Augustino per totum librum de opere Monachorum, ex Basilij, item and Benedicti
regula, and cap. De Praesentium 16. q. 1. manifest conste^, olim Monachos
manibus laborare consucuisse? Respondeo, cum S. Thoma Opusc. 19. cap. 5. Non
idem iuris esse de Mendicantibus, quod de Monachis: illi enim sunt instituti ad
docendum, concionandum, conferendum Sacramenta, and proinde ad diligentem
literis operam nauandam. Azor. Ies. ibid. cap. 1.. Septimo quaeritur.
because (says he) they are appointed to preach. Nevertheless, Ignatius
Loyola provided for the Order of his society of Jesuits See confessed above,
lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 38.
sufficient of victuals, even because learning is not attained unto in extreme
beggary.

20 So now the reason why their Mendicants work not, but beg, is because
they use to preach: contradictorily, the reason why the Jesuits are provided
for, that they beg not, is because they are ordained to preach. But if begging
be an hinderance unto preaching, why do the Mendicants beg? If voluntary
begge^y be no hinderance unto that function, but even a furtherance unto
perfection, why do not the Jesuits beg? Finally, in their not begging
Orders, which have so great plenty, we find, as yet, no perfection of
poverty; and in their begging sect (being unlawful) no poverty of perfection.

21 Only the point of merit remains, which their De secunda quaestione
Nicholaus 4. qui in cap. Exijt, de verborum signif. in sexto, sentit illam
paupertatem esse sanctam, and meritoriam, negat Johannes. Et quanquam melius
Nicholaus sentit, tamen nec Nicholaus hoc definiuit, tanquam a^ticulum fidei,
nec Johan. 22. in Extrauag. suis, Tit. de verborum significat. direct hoc
impugnauit. Bellar. lib. 4. de Romans Pont. c. 14.. De secunda.
Pope Nicholas the fourth (anno 1288.) defended to be in voluntary poverty,
but Pope John the 22. (anno 1410.) denied it: and now the Romanists (as though
the latter Pope were not the wiser) do choose in this point to be (that we may
so speak) Nicolaitans.

22 Wherefore (that we may conclude, not from any Authors passion, but from our
Adversaries testimonies and positions:) There is a necessary relinquishment of
all, or of some wealth, belonging unto all Christians, in the habitual
preparation of the heart always, and in actual effect, whenever riches and
Christ, sense and faith, God and Mammon strive for masterdome: Mat. 6. 24.
No man can serve two masters. But this renunciation is not upon counsel
only, but upon commandment, even that which we have learned as the A B C of
our Christianity, Mat. 19. 29.
Leave father etc. and Mat. 16. 24.
take up the cross, and follow me; whether the commandment be temporal and
personal, as unto Abraham, to leave his fathers house; or perpetual and
general, to leave Babylon, and whatsoever hinders from salvation.

23 In the matter of counsel, for a man's more expedite course in
Christianity, it is free unto him to lessen his burden, and to change
property for community, but not for a profession of beggerie: yet so esteeming
of lawful actions as works of perfection, by comparing himself with himself,
not with others, who, as the true seed of Abraham, may be more perfect in
using their possessions, than he in renouncing them. 3. To relinquish the
opinion of merit, properly taken, because that which in gods indulge^ce is
matter of counsel, is, in regard of his strict justice, which says, Matthew. 5.
vlt. verse.
Be ye perfect, as your father which is in heaven is perfect, a case of
precept, especially by individual circumstances, and consequently so an act of
duty, and not of desert. 4. To beware of the Pharisees Mark. 7. 11.
Corban, that is, lest our zeal outrunne discretion, as men do, who so affect
perfection of the rule of counsel, as that thereby sometime they transgress
the law of commandment.

CHAP. V. Of the Remission of Sins.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
And the denial of the power of Priests to remit sins, in the Sea this
hereafter, Tract 3. Sect. 1. in the margent, at tho letter, x.
Nouatian^.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the testimonies of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
OUR Adversaries have diversely interpreted the heresy of the Nouatians: their
first exposition is, that they taught, that Tertia haeresis omnem poenitentiae
virtutem tollit, dicens eos qui semel lapsi sunt, nunquam postea consequi
remissionem, quantum libet postea poeniteant. Huius author fuit Nouatus, etc.
Alphons. de Castro aduer. here is. li. 12. Tit. De Poenitentia.. Tertia haeresis.
His whole discourse there is to prove, that he takes from God power of
forgiveness of sin in such cases: and Omne peccatum lethale post baptismum
commissum, irremissible censuerunt. Vega lib. 13. de Iustif. cap. 2.. Secundo.
page 486. And Origenes Tract. in Matthew. 35. haec verba edisserens, videtur
astruere, quod impossible s^t, eos, qui post susceptam Euangelicae
praedicationis gratiam, and fidem. abnegauerunt Christum, rursum ad
poenitentiam reuerti, and veniam delicti impetrare. Qui error in Nouatianis
damnatus est. Senens. Bibl. S. l. 6. Annot. 119. initio.
no man committing any mortal sin after baptism, could possibly obtain
pardon at Gods hands, although he became never so penitent; as their Castro,
Vega, and Senensis do conceive. But Cardinal Bellarmine does not think that
they were so blind as to Neque, vt nonnulli falso existimant, poenitentiae and
spem veniae a Deo obtinendae haeretici (meaning Nouatians) tollebante medio.
Bellar lib. 1. de Paenit. cap. 9. initio.
deny all hope of pardon from God: neither will he seem to be so malicious,
as to impute this error unto Protestants.

2 A second understanding of this Nouatian heresy their Cardinal Baronius
delivers, to be Cyprianus pluribus docet, Nouatianum eius fuisse sententiae,
vt negaret semel lapsos amplius in Ecclesiam esse admittendos, sed esse Dei
iudicio relinquendos, nec vllum lapsorum habendum esse dise imen, criminumve
distincti^^^^. 1. -- Porro quod Nouatianus, de cuius haeresi sermo est, --
negaret quod est in Apostolico Symbolo, Remissionem peccatorum in Ecclesia
reperiri. Sed and ex necessaria quoque assumptione haeresis, eiusmodi deduci
conclusio videbatur, vt a Christo datas Ecclesiae claues procaciter negaretur.
-- In quos Augustinus de Agon. Christi, cap. 31 -- Noluit credere datas
Ecclesiae claues regni coelorum, ipsi eas de mambus amiserunt. Card. Baron.
anno 254. number. 104 107.
a denial of the power of the keys in the Church, for admitting any that
sins after Baptism, by remission of sin, although he repent. Which their
Jesuit Ioh. 5. 4. Dixit Christus, Noli amplius peccare, etc.] Ex quo loco
probat Pacianus, epist. 3 contra Nouatianos, non negandum esse poenitentibus
veniam, nec enim dixiflo Christum, iam noli peccare, quia non sanaberis iterum,
sed, ne deterius aliquid tibi contingat. Maldonat. Ies. comment. in Ioh. 5. 14.
Maldonate confirms out of Pacianus; and adds, that this same Abutebantur
hoc loco Matthew 9. 6. Nouatiani, vt probarent, non posse Sacerdotes remittere
peccata: quemadmodum hodie little haeredes Caluiniani in cundem errorem
abutuntur. Idem comment. in Matthew. cap. 9. verse. 6. col. 225.
heresy is hereditarie in the Caluinists: which the Apologists do likewise
insinuate.

3 But as truly as they have related the heresy of the Nouatians, so untruly
have they entitled Protestants in that heresy: for even Calvin himself, in
his express confutation of the Catharists and Nouatians, catechizeth his
Reader in these Tria igitur hic nobis obseruanda, (in the margent is noted
Refutatio Catharorum) primum, neminem in hoc mortali corpore sine peccatorum
remiss one consistere posse cora^ Deo: deinde, hoc ben^ficium est I celesiae
proprium, vt non aliter fruamur, quam si permaneamus in illius communione. 3.
Per Ecclesiae ministros hoc dispensari vel praedicatione Euang^lij, vel
sacramentorum administratione; atque hac in part maxim en^inere clauiu^

three points. First, that every one, as long as he lodges in this mortal
body, has need of remission of sin. Secondly, This remission must be had in
the Church. Thirdly, It is performed by the power of the keys, which Christ
has given unto every faithful congregation. And although Calvin had been
silent, yet is God able out of hearts as hard toward him as stones, to raise
up witnesses in his behalf: for behold, his greatest Adversary (Cardinal
Bellarmine) testifies, that Hanc antiquissima^ Haeresin iam olim damnatam
iterum excitare conatus est Lutherus and qui post eu^ surrexerunt falsi
Prophetae Zuinglius, Caluinus, and caeteri. Nam etiamsi reco^ciliatione^

Nouatianis, tamen veram and iudiciariam potestatem peccata ren ittendi non
minus Sacerdotibus negant Lutherani, quam olim Nouatiani. Bellar. lib. 1 de
Poenit cap. 9.. Hanc.
Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, and others do acknowledge a certain
reconciliation of sins after Baptism: Non probant (Protestants) quod ijdem
(Nouatiam) eos, qui poenitentiam agerent, nolebant absoluere, and ad
communionem admittere. Coccius Thesaur. Cath. Tom. 1. lib. 8. art. 3.
Wherein (says Coccius) Protestants dissent from the Nouatians.

4 Not that the Cardinal is less calumnious, but that he meant to be more
subtle than other accusers, and therefore intends to draw Protestants within
the compass of the heresy of the Nouatians by a third manner of
interpretation thereof. First, Non negant aduersarij dari Ecclesiae potestatem
soluendi and ligandi, aut retinendi, sed hanc potestatem interpretantur
Ministerium praed^candi, and annunciandi poenitentibus remissionem peccatorum,
and impoemtentibus itam. -- Id^irco nobis probandum est, datam esse veram
potestatem ex authoritate ab oluendi, ac per hoc sacerdotes iud ces esse in
causis peccatorum, vice Christ's. Bellar. lib. 3. de Poenitent. cap. 2.. Et
quoniam.
For although Protestants (says he) acknowledge a power of reconciliation
toward sinners, yet do they not account this power of remission of sins to
be judicial, but only by way of preaching and declaring that sins are
remitted: which he will have to be the Nouatian heresy; and which we shall
prove to be neither the heresy of the Nouatians, nor yet any heresy.

5 To show that this was not the doctrine of the Nouatians, we dare appeal
unto the judgment of Cardinal See above at c, d.
Baronius, See above at c, d.
Maldonate, and (for ought that does appear) unto the whole School of
Jesuits: who without all questioning, whether the form of reconciliation, by
them denied, were indicative, or indicative, did judge this only their
heresy, even the absolute denial, that the Church had power to promise
reconciliation or remission to repentant sinners, who had transgressed after
Baptism, or to admit them again into their communion: according unto the
consonant testimonies of S. Negant oportere reddi communionem his, qui
praeuaricatione lapsi sunt Ambros. lib. 1. de Poenit. c. 1. Tom. 1.
Ambrose, and S. Nouatianus nolens Apostatas suscipere poenitentes. Hieron.

Jerome.

6 In the second point, which concerns the truth of the doctrine, we have for
our Advocate, the chief master of the Romish school, who from no worse
premises then are the testimonies of the ancient Fathers, concludes: Ecce
quam varia a Doctoribus traduntur s^per ijs, and in hac t^nta va^ierate quid
tenendum? Hoc sane dicere ac sentire possumus: quod solus Deus dimittit peccata
and retinet* and tamen ^cclesiae contulit potestatem ligandi, and soluendi: sed
aliter ipse soluit, vel ligat, aliter Ecclesia. Ipse enim per se tantum (...)
peccatum, quia and animam mundat ab interiori macula, and a debito aeternae
mortis soluit. -- Non autem hoc Sacerdotibus concessit, quibus tamen tribuit
potestatem soluendi and ligandi, id est, ostendendi homines ligatos, vel
solutos. Vnde Dominus leprosum sanitati prius per se restituit, deinde ad
Sacerdotes misit, quorum iudicio ostender^tur mundatus. Magister Sent. lib. 4.
did. 18. fol. 108. 109.
God binds and loses otherwise then does the Church; He by inwardly purging
the soul from the spot of sin, and freeing it from the debt of eternal
death, this cannot the Church do (says he,) but has power of binding and
loosing, that is, of declaring what sinners are either loosed or bound: which
declaratiue manner of absolution their late Franciscane preacher did publicly
profess as Quorum remiseritis, etc. (and likewise upon the cap. 11. Venite ad
me omnes.) Non quod homo proprie remittat peccatum, sed quod osten dat ac
certificet a Deo remissu^: neque enim aliud est absolutio, quam ab homine
accipis, quam si dicat; En, sili, certifico te, tibi remissa esse peccata:
annuncio tibi te habere propitium Deum, and quaecunque Christus in Baptismo and
Euangelio nobis promisit, tibi nunc per me annunciat and promittit. Ferus lib.
2. com. in Joan. 20. in verba, Quorum re^iseritis, etc.
the only absolution: and their Bishop Petrus Parisiorum Episcopus, Hieronymi

judgment of the Church, and ^or if the power of the Church were Judicial,
then whosoever is bound by the Church, should be insallibly bound in heaven:
but our Adversaries acknowledge Clauem errantem, that the Church may err in
excommunication and reconciliation; but the Judicial, which is of God, is
always infallible. Yet observe, that when we deny the Judicial, we speak
not against the ext^rnall and ritua^ manner of absolution, which Cardinal
Bellarmine does confess to be used alm^st of all Protestants, thus: De hac
igitur poenitentia, quae signis externis proditur, quaestio est, an Sacramentum
dici debeat: -- Absolutionis autem ritum aliquem sere omnes agnoscunt, licet de
vi and efficacia absolutionis, de ministro qui eam pronunciat, deque alijs
multis rebus ad absolution^m pertinentibus, multae sunt inter nos and
aduersarios quaestiones. Bellar. Tom 2. de Poenit. l. 1. ^. 8.. De hac.
unto truth it self.

7 So that now we see the Adversaries of Protestants divided, and like the
accusers of Suzanna between (as it is in the Greek) (...) and (...), that is,
the holme and lentiske tree. For the first sort, to make Protestants guilty,
said, that the Nouatians denied all power of reconciliation in the Church after
Baptism: and their Cardinal answers in behalf of Protestants, saying, that
they do not so. Afterward he accuses them only about the form of absolution
and reconciliation, which he contendeth to be judicial: which (by the
judgment of his colleagues) was not the heresy of the Nouatians: and by the
conclusion of his master and others, is not an heresy, but a sound and
orthodoxall truth.

An other calumniation.
SECT. 2.
8 Nevertheless, they are resolved to condemn Calvin for Nouatianoru^ error
praecipuus erat, non esse in Ecclesia potestatem reconciliandi homines Deo,
nisi per Baptismum. Bellar. l. 4. de notis Eccles. cap. 9.. 6. Nouatianorum.
Quae sententia express Caluinistarum est; nam Calvin. l. 4. Instit. cap. 19..

Hieron. ait, Poenitentiam esse secundam tabulam post naufragium, plane impium
est, and excusari non potest. Ibid.. Quae sententia.
Nouatianisme. What has he said? It is, forsooth, because he held it a
derogation unto the virtue of Baptism, to esteem of Penance as properly a
second table after a shipwreck. Ementitum hoc sacramentum ornarunt, quo
decebat elogio, secundam esse tabulam post naufragium: quia si quis vestem
innocentiae in Baptismo perceptam peccando corruperit, per poenitentiam
reparare potest. Sed dictum est Hieronymi. Cuiuscunque sit, quum plane impium
sit, excusari nequit, si ex eorum sensu exponitur. Quasi vero per peccatum
deleatur Baptismus, and non potius in memoriam reuocandus sit peccatori,
quoties de peccati remissione cogitat, vt i^lic sese colligat, animumque
recipiat, and fidem confirmet, peccatorum remissionem se impetraturum, quae
sibi in Baptismo promissa sit. Quod autem dure and improprie Hieron. dixit,
Poenitentia reparari Baptismum (a quo excidunt, qui excommunicari ab Ecclesia
merentur) boni isti interpretes ad suam impietatem trahunt. Calvin. Instit.
lib. 4. c. 19. number. 17.. Ne tamen.
Calvin thinks S. Hierome used this saying in an improper, and that the
Romanists held it in an impious sense, namely so, as if Baptism were utterly
broken off by sin: but he contrary-wise teaches, that there is no remission
of sin in any person baptized, but it is with reference unto the covenant of
Caluinus non vult opus esse nouo Poenitentiae sacramento, quo coelesti Patri
reconciliemur, Cuius, inquit, vis in Bapt smo viget, ideoque Baptismi memoria^
esse repetenda^. Lindanus Panop. lib. 4. c. 57. fol. 349.
Baptism; which may be confirmed out of this saying of S. Augustine;
Augustinus quoque in exp. epist. ad Romans inchoata, circa fine^: Eos, inquit,
qui iam baptizati fuerunt, curari melius dicimus per poenitentia^, non
tenouari; quia renouatio in baptismo est, vbi quidem operatur poenitentia, sed
tanqua^ in fundamento. Manente itaque fundamento recurai aedificiu^ potest, si
autem fundamentum iterare quis voluerit, aedificium subuertat necesse est.
August. test Salmer. Ies ^^m. 15. in Heb. 6. disp. 14. page 717.
Although we be cured (says he) by repentance, yet are we not renewed but by
Baptism, which is the irreiterable foundation of Penance. In which regard
Theodoret notes the one only Baptism of a Christian to Haec autem dixit
diuinus Apostolus, dicens Iudaeos, qui crediderunt, ne existimarent sanctiss.
Baptismu^ esse similem Baptismis Iudaicis^ illi enim non soluebant peccata, sed
corporis sordes, quae videbantur, purgabant, qua de causa multa and frequenter
adhibebantur. Hic autem vnus est, vt qui salutaris passionis and resurrectionis
typum habeat, and futuram resurrectionem ante describat. The^ doritus Tom. 2.
as he is cited by Salmeron, ibid. page 715.
differ from all Jewish washings, because they, (says he) purging only the
filth of the flesh, were often applied; this, purifying the soul, is but one,
as being the healthful type of the death and resurrection of Christ. Which
their own Ferus did understand right well, when (speaking of the
Ecclesiastical absolution) he says, that See above Sect. 1. at the the
letter, n, in the margin.
there is pronounced and declared that remission which was promised in Batisme.

9 And all this obscure point may be illuminated by a similitude not altogether
incongruous. If a woman, who is deprehended in folly, shall afterward be
reconciled unto her husband, she does not enter into a new contract of marriage,
but only takes upon her a new resolution, with a relation unto the first
covenant. So: -- but we presume our Reader will make up the comparison.

10 In these three interpretations we have discerned three injuries, the first
against the Nouatians, to make their heresy greater than it was: the second
against Protestants, by (as has been confessed) a false application of the
Nouatian heresy: the third against principal Romanists, who hold the third
sense to be no heresy at all. Now are we to try,

What affinity the Romanists themselves have with the foresaid Nouatians.
SECT. 3.
11 That Catholici omnessumma consensione contrarium docent: fatentur enim

Catharists, and some of their Catholics.

CHAP. VI. Of the objected heresies of the Manichees, in two points, 1.
Free Will, 2. the power of Baptism.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The denial of Free Will, and of remission of sins, and grace conferred in
Baptism, in the Hieron, in prooem. libroru^ aduersus Pelagianos, fine, says,
Manichaeorum est hominum damnare naturam, and liberum auferre arbitrium, and
Dei adiutorium. And see Hierome in explan Symb. ad Damasum. And S. Austine de
fide contra Manich. c. 9. says, Aduersus haec solita caecitaete Manichaei
latrant, and cum con^^ncuntur naturam non esse malum, sed in potestate esse
hominis facere been aut male, dicunt non esse animae liberam voluntatem, and
non vident caecitatem suam, etc. Et vide ibidem cap. 10. and in actis cum
Eaelice Manichaeo, lib. 2. cap. 4. And Chrysostom in John, hom. 45. prope
initium, says, Christ said to them, No man can come to me, except the Father
who sent me, draw him: hereat the Manichees do rise up contending by the
testimony of this scripture, that we can do nothing of our selves, etc. But
this takes not away our freewill, but shows that we need Gods help. And
concerning their other point touching Baptism, M. Whitaker l. 10. contra
Duraeum, page 883. confesses the same, saying: Nos in Baptismo peccata
remitti, and grati^m conferri credimus ac docemus, quod negare soliti sunt
Manichaei; ergo nos a Manichaeis alieni sumus. Et vide Sarcerium loc. commun.
tom. 1. de Baptismo, fol. 232. b. post medium.
Manichees.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
Free Will is considered as it was in Adam before his transgression, or as in
Adam and his offspring, after he had taken that dismal fall. The Manichees
speaking only of the first, Manichaeus docuit, quod creaturae sunt malae ex se
and generatione sua, quia ex malo Deo creatae sunt. Alphonsus de Castro lib. 4.
Tit. Creatura. haeres. 2. Manichaei docuerunt, Diabolum ex sua natura malum
esse, nec posse esse bonum. Ibid. lib. 5. Tit. Diabolus. haeres. 1.
taught (says Alphonsus, their compiler of heresies,) that creatures are
naturally evil. The sentence of S. Hierome, objected by the Sea their margent.
Apologists, shows as much, viz. The Manichees condemned man's nature. So does
their Manichaeoru^, inquit Hieron. est, hominum condemnate naturam, and liberum
auferre arbitrium: and Aug. haeres. c 46 peccatoru^ origine^, inquit, non
tribuunt Manichaei libero arbitrio. Idem aperte Sectarij omnes. Lutherus art.
36. dicit, liberum arbitrium esse rem de solo titulo --. Caluinus l. 2. Instit.
c. 2, 3, 4. non permittit homini liberam electionem vlla in re.. Bellar. l. 4.
de notis Eccles. cap. 9.. 8. Manichaeorum.
Cardinal charge Calvin, and all the Protestants; and their Jesuit Noluerunt
minus ingeniosi videri Caluinistae: nam and ipsi nunc cum Manichaeis liberum
tollunt arbit^ium: hoc etiam subtilius, quod illi in vtramque pariter partem,
hi in bonum, non in malum tollunt; non videntes homines errore suo caeci, non
solum malam arborem bonos, sed nec bonam malos fructus facere posse. -- Non
solum in malum, sed etiam in bonum liberum habemus arbitrium, contra quam
Caluinistae; and non aequaliter in vtrumque, sed in malum satis forte; in
bonum, nisi Dei gratia adiuuetur, infirmum, contraquam Pelagiani sentiebant.
Maldon. Ies. com. in Matthew. 7. 18. page 189. 190.
Maldonate prosecuteth the accusation to the full.

2 Calvin himself desires to be heard speak: Dicimus ergo naturali hominem
vitiositate corruptum, sed quae a natura non fluxerit. A natura fluxisse
negamus. vt significemus aduentitiam magis esse qualitatem, quae homini
acciderit, quam substantialem proprietatem, quae ab initio indita fuerit. --
Non etiam inepte dicetur naturaliter prauus and vitiosus: quemadmodum non
veretur Augustinus, ratione corruptae naturae, naturalia dicere peccata, quae
in carne nostra necessario regnant, vbi abest Dei gratia. Ita euanescat stultum
Manichaeorum nugamentum, qui cum substantialem in homine malitiam
imaginarentur, alterum illi conditorem affingere ausi sunt, ne iusto Deo
viderentur mali causam and principium assignare. Caluinus Instit. l. 2. c. 1..
11.
We say (says he) that the vicious corruption which is in man, came not from
nature; away with the foolery of the Manichees, who imagine that there was a
substantial wickedness in man's nature. Now call in again both his accusers,
and see if they do not effectually discharge him: the first, Caluinus concedit
primum hominem, ante lapsum, libero arbitrio praeditum fuisse: -- sed nunc co
carere. L. 1. Instit. c. 15.. 8. and l. 2. c. 5.. 18. Bellarm. lib. 4. de Great
and Arbit. c. 7.. Postremo.
Calvin (says he) confesses, that man had free will before his fall. Now
listen unto the second accuser, See the testimony of Maldonate above, at the
letter, d.
The Manichees took away the wills freedom, as well in respect of good as of
evil: but the Caluinists (says he) deny that man (namely after the fall)
has freedom unto good, but grant it to be free unto evil.

3 Well then, by the first it appears that the Manichees denied free will in
man's perfect and created nature, and that Protestants deny the freedom of
will only in respect of man's nature tainted and corrupted: by the second we
understand that the Manichees held man's will even after his fall, to be free
neither unto good nor evil, and that Protestants teach man's will after the
first sin, to be free unto evil, but not unto good. So that the Manichees
and Protestants are at no less difference in the point of free will, then
there is between man standing, and man fallen, between nature create and
corrupt, between good and evil. This will not be thought sufficient, except
we further show,

That Protestants doctrine, concerning Free Will, is the more truly Catholic.
SECT. 2.
4 If the doctrine of ancient Fathers, teaching that Adam by sinning lost (as
the Luc. 15.
prodigal child did his substance) his free will unto good; or the suffrage of
diverse Romanists, denying the will to be absolutely active; or the testimonies
of their public Schools, concluding that the grace of God does determinate
the will; besides other their confessions of the more safety of our doctrine,
can warrant our Protestantiall defense ( See above lib. 2 cap. 10.
all which have been particularly and fully manifested by direct allegations;)
then must our Adversaries suspect the spirit, by which they have accused
Protestants of Manicheisme: the rather for that their own Salmeron Ies. See
above lib. 4. cap. 24.
Jesuit has set this down, (and that truly) for a special note of the true
Church, to depresse nature, in respect of Grace. They will now require

An answer unto the second point of Manicheisme, concerning the power of
Baptism: from the testimonies of our Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
5 Who do accuse the Protestants herein? Even the Romish Apologists, and that
very vrgently: See above in their objection.
Sundry heretics (say they) denied sundry points of our now Catholic
faith, and among other points, is the denying with the Manichees, that grace is
conferred in Baptism. Thus are Protestants accused: who shall absolve the^?
Even the same Apologists, by the very same testimony, whereby they intend to
prove Protestants to be guilty of this heresy of the Manichees.

6 The testimony lurketh in the margent, masked in Latin: we shall need but
only to draw it into view, by translating it. Concerning the other point
touching Baptism, Master Whitaker (say they) confesses the same, saying:
What? viz. We (says Doctor Whitaker, speaking of Protestants) teach, that
sins are forgiven in Baptism, and grace therein conferred, which doctrine
the Manichees are wont to deny: therefore are we far from the opinion of the
Manichees. Whereunto assenteth their other objected Author Sarcerius, noting it
among the ancient errors, to say, that Sarcerius Loc. Com. c. 34. De Baptismo.
Notwithstanding, if any Protestant believing that sins are forgiven before
Baptism, by the grace of God, and power of his sancti^ying spirit, s^metime
going before the outward sign; yet cannot he be thought guilty of the error
of the Manichees, who adhere rather to nature, denying the truth of Christ his
body, and virtue of his resurrection.
Baptism is only a sign, or only an outward washing of the body, or that
it takes not away the guilt of original sin. Again, the power of
conferring grace in Baptism, has been See above.
confessed by our Adversaries to be the general doctrine of Protestants.

7 The sum of this accusation is, that the Protestants are Manichaean
heretics, who are the known Adversaries unto the Manichees. What ingenuous
mind would not congratulate the Protestants happiness, to see them thus
acquitted not only by their opposite accusers, but even by the accusation it
self? and judge that such accusers do best deserve the name of Manichaei a
quodam Persa extiterunt, qui vocabatur Manes, (Madm^n) quasi and ipsum cum eius
insana doctrina coepisset nomen praedicari. August. Tom. 6. haeres. 46.
Manes, the first father of the Manichees?

CHAP. VII. Of the necessity of Childrens Baptism.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The denial of the necessity of childrens Baptism, in the Innocentius in
rescripto ad Mileuitanum Concilium, post med says of the Pelagians, Illud vero
quod vestra fraternitas eos asserit praedicare, (...) aeternae vitae praemijs
absque Baptismatis gratia posse donari, perfatuum est. In like plain manner is
this point conden^^ (...) the Pelagians, by S. Austine, haer. 88. and contra
Iul. Pelag. l. 6. c. 7. and de pec. mer. and rem. l. 2. c. 9. and 27. and by S.
Leo, epist ^^, ad Episcopum Aquiliensem.
Pelagians.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Freeing themselves from the note of Pelagianisme.
SECT. 1.
THis denial of the necessity of childrens Baptism, is now the second time
objected against Protestants: but then in the name of an error, now under the
title of an ancient heresy, issuing from such Authors, whom they themselves
(because of See above lib. 2 cap. 10. Sect. 11.
some alliance they have with them) should doubt to call heretics. But to the
point: We say that our Adversaries in this one objection are thrice indiscreet.

2 First, by not considering that the same sentence may be both heretical and
orthodoxall, according unto the different intention of the professors thereof,
even as the salutation of hail Master, offered unto Christ the son of God,
by devout worshippers, was a due honor; but being cast upon him by the
despisers and mockers, was (more bitter than the veneger and gall) rank
blasphemy.

3 So in doctrines, Polycrates, and the holy Martyrs of the Greek Church held
the time of Easter at the time which was observed of the Jews: which Time also
Blastus the heretic did precisely keep: these contrary professors were
distinguished in one action by the difference of their intentions; for the
Blastia^s held it Iewishly, as thinking the Leuitical law necessary; but the
Martyrs kept the same time of Easter Christianly in an opinion of
indifferency, until at length that time of observation was changed, to the end
that the Jewish and Christian professors might be better distinguished. Many
hundred like examples might be produced, of Catholic speeches and customs
which have been heretically professed, and gave the Fathers occasion to call
the Devil, Gods Ape: because he so sorteth his heresies, that they may carry
in them an imitation of truth.

4 So also even in our Adversaries themselves, who forbid the eating of
certain meats, as the heretical Tatianists and Manichists anciently had done,
but with a difference: for The Rhemists in their Annot. upon 1. Tim. 4. 3.
the foresaid heretics taught, that men might not eat certain sorts of
meats, because they thought they were not made of the good God, but of the
evil: for the which cause they were condemned in Councels. But abstinence from
certain meats is appointed in our Church (say the Rhemists) for chastising the
body with penance. Hereby according unto us, that it is not always quid, but
quo; that is, not the same action, but the diverse Principles, and intentions
of the action, do distinguish truth from heresy.

5 So finally it is between the Protestants and the Pelagians: the Pelagians
held a no-necessitie in Baptism, because they thought that the grace of nature
was sufficient for the childrens salvation: Protestants hold it not to be of
absolute necessity, because of the free power of grace above nature: which
teaches, that when there is defect of Baptism, without contempt, Gods mercy
is See confessed above, lib. 2. cap. 13. Sect. 6. etc.
not tied unto the outward elements. Secondly, the Pelagians held childrens
Baptism not necessary in the Church; Protestants teach the necessity of
childrens Baptism in the Church, and the sanctifying grace, and power thereof.
Thirdly, the Pelagians reason is taken from the perfection of nature, the
Protestants depends upon the Axioms of grace. Notwithstanding all these
maine distances, yet have the Romanists not spared to rank Protestants thus
indiscreetly with (their most opposite Adversaries) the graceless Pelagians.

6 The next symptom of indiscretion proceeds from the partiality of their
affection, whilst they insist upon the testimonies of some Fathers, for proof
that children cannot be saved without Baptism: and yet, contrary to Only the
judgment of Origin may be excepted, which we account as none, because it is
condemned by the Romanists themselves. See above, lib. 2. cap. 13. Sect. 8.
all Fathers, hold a Limbus infantum, which they call a peaceable receptacle
for all infants dying before Baptism. But it is not sufficient that a man be
no heretic, except also he be, explicita fide, orthodoxall: therefore we
furthermore affirm,

That Protestants in the objected doctrine of Baptism, are true Catholics.
SECT. 2.
7 A third note of indiscretion arises from their want of charity, whil^st in
their zeal to reach Protestants a blow, they do not care whom they hit,
whether ancient Fathers (who contrary unto the doctrine of absolute
necessity, did See above lib. 2 cap. 1^. Sect. 4.
delay Baptism a long while,) or else their own brethren, to wit, the Ibidem,
Sect. 5.
above mentioned Cardinal Caietane, Gabriel, Gerson, Catharin, Pigius, Elisius,
Segebergensis, Tilmannus, and others, who taught with us, that not the defect,
but the contempt of Baptism does condemn the unbaptized. Which they have also
established with Ibidem, Sect. 7.
reasons inexpugnable, taken from the analogy of Circumcision, from the
comparison of ot her confessed powerful Baptismes of Sanguinis and Flaminis,
and (which surpasses all the rest) from the equanimitie of Gods mercy. We
forbear to retort the grand heresy of the Pelagians upon our Adversaries,
until Protestants have discharged themselves. Therefore do we proceed.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Reservation of the Sacrament.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The denial of the blessed Sacraments reservation, in the Cyril ad Calosyrium,
says, I hear they say, that the mystical blessing, if any remnant thereof do
remain till the next day following, is unprofitable to sanctification, but
they are mad in so saying for Christ is not made another, neither shall his
body be changed, but the virtue of (...) and lively grace do always remain in
it. This point is so plain and confessed, that Peter Martyr aduersus Stepham
G(...)neri librum de Eucharistia, printed Basileae anno 1581. object. 213. col.
838. post med. says of this saying of Cyril: Qu^d autem sub^^citur,
Eucharistiae reliquias asseruat as in crastinum diem, a sanctificatione non
cessare, spectat opin^r ad r^^^^^tam quandam consuetudinem (etc) ca consuetudo
etsi saperet nonnihil superstitionis, tamen illi Cyrillas al^que subscribebant:
statim (...) a temporibus Apostolorum paulatim coeptum est degenerari ab illa
veteri simplicitate diuini cultus.
Anthropomorphites.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
IT is a great disease, and that also a cac^^thes in our Adversaries to call
every reprehensible thing by the name of Heresy: the rather, because if the
ancient Fathers had so accounted hereof, then Epiphanius and S. Augustine, who
published Catalogues of heresies, when they branded the Anthropomorphites with
their proper heresies, would not have spared them in this. Howsoever, the
Protestants are acknowledged to grant, that See above lib. 2 cap. 3. Sect. 1.
although the Sacrament be reserved three days, yet it loses not the
property of a Sacrament, but may be administered unto persons in case of
extremity: and the Romanists themselves have Ibid. Sect. 3.
abrogated the supposed ancient custom of reservation, upon a pretense to
avoid an irreuerence.

2 These three observations: First, the denying of reservation of the
Sacrament, is no heresy. Secondly, Protestants do not deny all reseruatio^
thereof (no more than they do the water in the Font) so long as it may be
conueni^ntly used. Thirdly, the Romanists have abrogated the ancient custom of
reservation: all which do argue our Adversaries unwillingness to know either
the Anthropomorphites, or Protestants, or themselves: whom we must further put
in mind,

That (at least,) the vulgar Romanists are guilty of the proper heresy of the
Anthropomorphitae, in their misunderstanding of God.
SECT. 2.
3 Secunda haeresis est, quae docet Deum esse corporeum. -- Hi haeretici, a suo
^^iore nomen (...), vocat^ sunt Anthropomorphitae. quia Anthropos. ^rae^, idem
est quod Homo, Latin. Alphonsus de Castro cont. haeres. lib. 5. Tit. Deus.

Anthropomorphitae were so called, because they misconceiued, that God has a
bodily shape like a man; Haec ergo Anthropomorphitarum sententia, apert*
haereseos conuincitur. Idem ibid. See S. Augustine, Tom. 6. haeres. 50.
which (says their Alphonsus) is a manifest heresy, as See the same author.
Scriptures and Fathers, and also all learned See above lib. 4. cap. 27.
Romanists do acknowledge.

4 But whosoever shall sail in the Ocean of that See of Rome, and behold their
people, who are allowed to pray before the image of an old man, as before the
picture of God the Father; and shall ask them whether they are not persuaded
that God is a good man, and has the proportion and shape of a man: he shall
easily find how their Romish imagerie has turned their people into images,
void of true sense, and understanding of God.

5 Yet (not to do them the wrong, as not to show the chief reason they have
for picturing God in the likeness of a man) thus their Cardinal does
conclude: Homo est vera imago Dei, sed hominis potest pingi imago ergo and Dei:
nam quae est imago imaginis, est etiam exemplaris. -- Licet homo sit ad
imaginem Dei, ratione intellectus, and voluntatis, tamen ipse totus homo
intelligens and volens recte dicitur, and est imago Dei: nam Genesis 1. non ait
Deus, faciamus animam, sed faciamus homin^ ad imaginem Dei. -- Si aute^ ipse
totus homo est imago Dei, and totus homo vere pingitur, ergo imago Dei vere
pingitur. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. Sanct. cap. 8.. Quinto etc.
Man is the image of God, but man may be pictured; Ergo, the image of God may
be pictured. And when Protestants answer, that Man is not the image of God, but
in the faculties of his soul, which cannot be pictured: Ergo, the image of God
cannot be pictured: he replieth; Although man be the image of God, in respect
of his reason and will, yet whole man being intelligent is rightly called the
image of God; so that if the whole man can be pictured, then the image of God
may be pictured.

6 Which kind of argument no learned man could suggest, without a resolved
purpose to sophisticate. Which his fallacy (a figura dictionis) is easily
discovered by the like, thus: Although man be compared unto a beast, in respect
of his sensible and bodily part, yet the whole man being immortal and
sensible, is rightly compared unto a beast: so that if the whole man be
immortal, a beast may be likewise called immortal. And who knows not that
although the whole man may be said (Synechdochically) to be pictured, yet is
not man called the image of God in his whole, but in a part, which is, his
reasonable and invisible soul, which cannot be pictured.

7 Therefore S. Cyrill condemned the Dicebant, cum Scriptura ait, hominem
factum esse iuxta imaginem Dei* credendum esse Deum humana forma praeditum
esse; quod omnino stultum est, and extremae impietatis: -- Deus enim spiritus
est. -- Homo iuxta similitudinem Dei, quatenus rationis particeps, and amans
veritatis. Cyril. Alex. Tom. 2. aduers. Anthropomorph. in praef.
Anthropomorphites of impious folly, for imagining God to have the figure of a
man, because it is written, God made man after his own image: for by the image
here signified (says S. Cyrill) is meant man's reason and virtue: and,
Cassianus collat. 10. de Anthropomorphitarum haeresi disserens, ait huius
haeresis patronos ideo asserere Deum esse corporeum, quia Scriptura dicit,
hominem esse ad Dei imaginem factum. -- Haec facile, mea sententia,
prosternitur: nam si Deus corporeus non est, neque membra habet, vt homo: fieri
non potest, vt homo, secundum corpus, Dei imago dicatur. Alphonsus de Castro
contra haeres. l. 8. Tit. Imago. haeres. 2. fol. 184.
it cannot possibly be (says their own Castro) that man in respect of his
body should be called the image of God, Ex quibus colligimus haec omnia cum
agit, ab anima vires suas sumere: cum ergo sola anima habeat intellectum,
memoriam and voluntatem, consequens est, vt secundum solam etiam animam Dei
imaginem homo portet. -- Potuissem pro hac re plura Sanctorum testimonia
coaceruare, verum nolui in re manifestissima nimia prolixitate grauare
lectorem. Ibidem.
but only in respect of his soul: Which he grants might be proved by heaps
of testimonies from Antiquity: Therefore ought their Cardinal have rather
leaned unto the right hand of the ancient practice of the primitive Church,
which never pictured God, tha^ to incline so much unto the left hand, and thus
by sophistry to foster the gross heresy of the Anthropomorphites among their
people.

Anthropomorphites thought (as their Jesuit Posseuine gathers out of S.
Cyrill,) that man should never labor, but always pray: does not this picture
out one side of the cheeks of some Monks, who make praying their only labor?

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
THE doctrine of Marriage comes again in this Scene in the persons of
Vigilantius and Iouinian, which are two noted by. S. Hierome, and applied
against Protestants by the art of Romanists. All these Actors require their due
and distinct observations.

2 First, Vigilantius and Iouinian are condemned by S. Hierome, against whose
judgment in this case, an Author excepted, saying, that In Indice Frobenij:
Hieronymus in matrimonium contumeliosus. Deleatur. Index Expurg. apud Iunium,
page 24.
Jerome spoke too basely and contumeliously of Marriage: which taxation the
Romish Censurists have commanded to be blotted out; as though this exception
against Hierome were either a truth ignorantly, or a falsehood maliciously
delivered; or else, whether it be true or false, because a Protestant has
spoken it, therefore must it be blotted out. Wherefore we present them with the
testimonies of their own Authors, among whom their Jesuit Salmeron says,
Etsi quidam inter veteres Patres castitatis and continentiae studiosi, paulo
iniquiores and acerbiores in secundum co^iugium extiterint, vt Terrullianus and
Hieronymus; qui etsi veritatem aperte profiteatur and teneat, vbi tamen locus
occurrit dehortandi ab hoc matrimonio, acrior est atque feruentior. Salmeron
Ies Tom. 14. in 1. Cor. 7. disp. 14.. Ad dubium.
Hierome was too bitter and hot in dehorting from second marriages. Their
Bishop Espencaeus further adds, that Hierome seems to have been less
equal, even in the case of first marriage: concerning which point their Rhenanus
notes, that See above lib. 2. cap. 1. Sect. 3.
Hierome was evil spoken of at Rome, yea and that Hieronymus impendio fauens
virginitati, and ob id nuptijs iniquior, quam Episcopi quidam esse volebant.
Erasmus Arg. in Hieron. contra Iouin.
by Bishops, says Erasmus. Yet is S. Hierome brought in for a sole accuser of
Vigilantius and Iouinian, in a cause, wherein he is noted to have been
vehemently unequal. Which we speak not in defense of any error of Iouinian,
or Vigilantius: and therefore we add, c Hieronymus aequus sane parum videtur
vel vnis nuptijs. Espencaeus lib. 3. de Continent. cap. 11. initio.


That the Protestants are justified from the objected error of Vigilantius: by
the testimonies of their Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
3 That which is requisite in the direct trial of all causes, we require may
be performed in this; viz. to hear the accusation first; which we may receive
from the mouth of Cardinal Bellarmine: Vigilantius docuit, Ecclesiasticos
debere esse vxoratos. -- Eadem omnia nunc docent Sectarij: Lutherus, etc.
Bellar. de notis Eccles. c. 9.. 13. Vigilantius.
Vigilantius taught that Ecclesiastical persons ought to be married: so does
Luther (says he) and (speaking of other Protestants) all Sectarists. We now
understand the case aright: Vigilantius taught that Ecclesiastical persons
ought to be married; and (as their Jesuit Coster shows more plainly out of S.
Hierome) Ex Hieronymo constat, Vigilantium haereticum docuisse, non esse
Diaconos ab Episcopis ordinandos, nisi prius duxissent vxores. Cester. Ies.
Enchirid. cap. 17. page 522.
Vigilantius taught that even Deacons should not be ordained, except they first
were married.

4 But will now their Cardinal give faith, that so do the Protestants, namely,
that they think it unlawful for any one to take Orders, before he be married?
This some of our Adversaries have sometime feined, whom their own Bishop
Espencaeus therefore suspected to have been Quid in hac re faciant Germani,
Helue^ij, and alij nuperi Romans Ecclesiae dese^tores nescio, sed vereor vt haec
illis coactio (speaking of the same point) falso imponatur. Episc. Espencaeus
lib. 1. de Cont. cap. 1. page 3.
slanderous. Which beyond all suspicion, is proved most false, by the
experience of many Ministers, which live unmarried. Yet because our Savior has
shown us that the best conviction of an Adversary is, ex ore tuo; Protestants
may in this case appeal unto their accuser Cardinal Bellarmine for their
justification, who distinguishes of (as he calls them) Duo sunt refutandi
errores, vnus Graecoru^, alter Lutheranorum. Prior error est, oportere
Clericos, antequam ordines sacros suscipiant, vxores ducere, quia post sacros
ordines susceptos, non licet id facere. -- Posterior error long grauior est;
non solum licere ante ordinationem, sed etiam post ordinationem vxorem ducere.
Bellar. lib. 1. de Cler. cap. 19. initio.
two errors, one of the Greeks, who teach that the Cleargie-men ought to be
married, before they enter into Orders; the second of the Lutherans, who say
(says he) it is lawful for them to marie both before, and after ordination.

5 Mark now (good Reader) and marvel at the confessed difference; the Greeks
taught an oportere, that is, that all Ecclesiastical persons ought to marie.
Which was the doctrine of Vigilantius, as the testimony of S. Hierome alleged
by the Apologists, shows: wherein Vigilantius is charged not to have suffered
so much as Proh nefas, Episcopos sui sceleris dicitu^ habere consortes; si
tamen Episcopi nominandi sunt, qui non ordinant Diaconos, nisi prius vxores
duxerint, nulli coelibi credentes pudicitiam: imo ostendentes quam sancte
viuant, qui male de omnibus suspicantur, and nisi praegnantes viderint vxores
clericorum, infantesque de vlnis matrum vagientes, Christi Sacramenta non
tribuunt. Quid facient Orient^^ Ecclesiae? etc. Hieron. Tom. 2. lib. contra
Vigilant page 121. As for this now objected (Orientis Ecclesiae) it was then,
and ever since otherwise in the Greek Church: as has been confessed. See
above lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 33. and 34.
Deacons to be consecrated, before that they be so manifestly married, that
their wives appear big-bellied. This oportere their Jesuit Coster, from the
judgment of S. Hierome, has confessed to have been the doctrine of
Vigilantius: which Cardinal Bellarmine also acknowledges, and yet could
object unto Protestants nothing but only a licere, that is, that they hold it
to be lawful. So now Vigilantius holding that it is unlawful not to be
married, Protestants only a lawfulness to marie; these a may, he a must, the
one side defending only a liberty of marriage, the other a necessity; could
Protestants be coached with Vigilantius? O disputers! Secondly,

Protestants are justified from the guilt of Iouinianisme.
SECT. 3.
6 Luther is the principal one, against whom in this point of comparison of
virginity and wedlock, the Romanists do enforce their troops: the Jesuit
Valentia accusing him of Iouinianisme, for Cuius erro^is (viz. non licere ante,
and post ordinationem matrimoniu^ inite) fundamentum quoddam iecit Iouinianns,
hoc ipso, quod praetulit matrimonium virginitati. Nam si matrimonium quiddam
praestantius est, and Deo gratius, nihil est cur sacrati Ministri causa
sanctitatis and religionis debeant a coniugio abstinere. Valent. Ies. Tom. 4.
disp. 9. q. 5. punct. 5.. 3.
preferring the married state before virginity: their Coccius, only for
Iouinianus virginitatem sanctimonialiu^ coniugiorum meritis adaequabat. Idem
Luther'. Coccius Thesaur. Tom. 1. l. 8. Art. 3. Tit. Iouinianus.
equalling them in worthiness: Cardinal Bellarmine, for both Iouinianus
asseruit, -- coniugium virginitati dignitate ac merito aequati: vnde etiam
aliquot sanctimoniales eius hortatu nupserunt. Bellar. c. 9. de notis Eccles..
12. Iouinianus.
equalling, and for See the next letter, ^.
preferring wedlock.

7 But what did Luther teach? Tertius error (meaning of Iouinian) est Martini
Lutheri, in Epithal. vbi exponens 1. Cor. 7 quatuor comparationes facit: prima
est castitatis cum matrimonio absolute, and sic fatetur castitatem esse
nobilius donum: 2. castitatis cum matrimonio coram Deo, and sic dicit esse
aequalia: 3. mulieris coniugatae cum virgin, and ait, Oportet admittamus
mulierem coniugatam coram Deo praestare virginibus. 4. status coniugatorum, and
Ecclesiasticorum profitentium coelibatum, statum coniugatorum ex natura sua
diuinum, coelestem, and quasi aurum; statum vero caelibum esse secularem,
terrenum, and quasi lutum. Similia habet Caluinus l. 4. Instit. c. 13.. 3. viz
the 3. and 4. Bellar. quo supra.. Tertius.
Luther (says their Cardinal) made four comparisons between continency and
matrimony. First, absolutely in themselves, and so he confesses that
continency is the more excellent and noble gift. Secondly, in respect of God,
and so he makes them equal. Thirdly, in the same respect he prefers
wedlock before virginity. Fourthly, comparing them in their own nature, he
calls the married state heavenly, the single state earthly; that gold, and
this clay. These comparisons their Cardinal has delivered in such obscurity,
as though Luther had been altogether For the first comparison prefers
virginity before marriage in it own nature, and the fourth does prefer
marriage: the second, in respect of God, makes them equal: and the fourth does
in the same respect hold marriage the more excellent.
contradictorie unto himself: which shows that the accuser was more willing
to relate his words, than to reveal his meaning, which in his As for his
objected Epithalamium, after much search, it could not be found.
other Tracts is very obuious, and any may conceive how the single life may (in
respect of marriage) be justly both equalled, preferred, and abased.

8 First, equalled: for compare both the states in a worthiness, which in
themselves they may seem to have before God, the Apostle will decide the
point: Gal. 3. 28.
In Christ, there is neither Jew, nor Grecian, neither bond nor free, neither
male nor female, etc. No respect of persons with God; then neither of married
nor unmarried: for these do take place among the outward respects, which are
equally excellent in Gods estimate. And thus is the second comparison founded
upon a common principle in Divinity.

9 Secondly, preferred, in respect of effects, and ends, in which regard it may
be that Luther called virginity the more excellent gift: which may be
understood to be more excellent in two respects; the first is, because it has
more Mary, and less Martha in it, and is of it self more free from temporal
cares, and thereby more expedite in Christian offices. In which consideration
the Apostle says, Beatior quodsi permanere potest ita libera, and in Domino
etiam, mea quidem s^entia beatior ent, vtpote quae minus molestiarum, minus
impedimenti habitura sit, vt spiritu and corpore sese totam in pretatis
exe^citationem tradat. Arius Montanus in 1. Cor. 3. ver. 40. page 125.
It is more blessed if thou remain unmarried. The second is the last end, that
God proportioning his reward of eternal blessedness according unto man's
works, which are the gifts of Gods grace, the more plentiful virginity is in
well doing, the more excellently it shall be rewarded in blessedness; yet not
for it own worth: for as their Aquinas truly observes, Perfectio vno modo
consideratur per se quidem and essentialiter, and sic consistit perfectio
Christianae vitae in charitate: altero modo, secundario, and accidentaliter, --
and sic consistit instrumentaliter in consilijs, quia omnia, sicut and
praecepta, ordinantur ad charitatem: -- vnde dicit Abbas Moses; Ieiunia,
vigiliae, meditatio Scriptura^um, nuditas, and priuatio omnium facultatum, non
perfectio sunt, sed perfectionis instrumenta, quod non consistit in illis
disciplinae finis, sed per illa peruenitut ad finem. And a little before:
Consilia ordinantur ad remouendu^ impedimenta actus charitatis, quae tamen
charitati non contrariantur. Aquinas 2, 2. qu. 184. ad 3.
watchings, fastings, nakedness, and the relinquishment of riches, are not
perfections in themselves, (which we apply unto contine^cy,) but only
instruments unto perfection. Neither of these respects of adua^cing virginity
above marriage can offend our Adversaries.

10 Thirdly, abased in respect of their disproportionate subjects, by a double
comparison, as S. Augustine does: first in minore and maiore genere boni; for
although the state of continency is in it own nature more destinate unto the
accomplishment of some Christian actions, than is the condition of wedlock, yet
the persons continent and married are not always accordingly disposed: for
sometime it happens that (as Clemens Alexandrinus notes) the coniugal
parties do ouermatch the virginal profession in the Qui enim perfectus fuerit,
exempla habet Apostolos, and reuera vir ostenditur non in ^o, quod vitam
elegerit monasticam; sed ille viros vincit, qui in matrimonio and liberorum
procreatione, and domus cura, ac prouidenti^, citra voluptatem, and dolorem se
exercet; and cum domus curatione est indiuulsus a Dei charitate, insurgens
aduersus omne^ tentationem, quae affertur per filios, vxorem, famulos: ei
autem, qui haec non habet, euenit magna ex part vt non tentetur. Clemens Alex.
Strom lib. 7. cap. 6.
perfection of godliness: in which respect S. Augustine concludes, that
Obed^entior coniugata minus obedienti virgini praeponenda est. August. lib. d^
bono coniugali, cap. 24. Tom. 6.
the party married being more obedient, is to be preferred before the contine^t
who is less obedient. And thus may Luthers preferring of the married before the
virgin be orthodoxally justified.

11 Lastly, if they be compared in genere contrario, as for example, an
inobedient virgin with a wife obedient unto Gods commandments, in this case
S. Augustine has resolved by an elegant Simile: Melius est habere Zachaei
staturam cum sanitate, quam Goliae cum febre. August. ibid.
It is better to have the little stature of Zachaeus with health, than the
great and vast body of Goliath with an ague. In like consideration when we
compare one professing virginity with a bondage of a perpetual vow (who has
not received the gift of continency, and consequently suffering manifold
exustions and scorches of concupiscence, and sometime also falling into
adulterous pollutions) with the married person, who for want of the same gift of
continency does enjoy Gods holy ordinance of marriage; in this case we shall,
with Luther, abase this kind of professed virgin before that kind of married
wife, as much as clay or the vilest dung upon the earth, in comparison of gold,
or of the most peerless pearl that can be named. This is no other doctrine
then that which the spirit of God has proclaimed, saying, 1. Cor. 7. 9.
It is better to marry than to burn: which, without blasphemy, cannot be
called heresy.

12 Concerning those others noted by Epiphanius speaks only of those who
transgressed Ecclesiastical Canons, which can make a scandal, but no heresy.
See above lib. 2. cap. 1. Sect 3.
Epiphanius and See above lib. 4. cap. 9. Sect. 1, 2, 3.
Syricius, we have sufficiently answered. We proceed to demonstrate,

That the Romish Church rather stands in an heresy, in the question of the
marriage of Priests.
SECT. 4.
13 Syricius, whom they produce for a witness against Protestants, is now
called to the bar to answer for himself, against the evidence brought in by
his own domestical witnesses: the chief of all is their own Bishop See
confessed above, lib. 4. ca 9. sect. 1. and 2. 3.
Espencaeus, accounting him as execrable as Iouinian; supposing that as
Iouinian allowed none for lawful Priests, who were not married, so Syricius
contrarily pronounced, that no married man, enjoying his wife, could lawfully be
a Priest: and for that cause removed all Priests who were married; him therefore
he leaves condemned by the Council of See confessed above lib. 4. ca. 9.

pe^orem esse: yet does he not dissolve such marriages, but holds them ratable;
reprehending the breach of the vow, not the state of their marriage.

14 Secondly, to free themselves from that Quicunque discernit a Presbytero,

their conflict, Pope Sergius condemning the Council, Pope Leo and Pope
Symmachus condemning his condemnation; and the Council condemning their now
Romish practice. Our Reader will observe how unfit accusers they are of
transgressors of the laws of Antiquity, whose Pope durst say (concerning the
marriage of Priests,) See confessed above lib 4. cap 9. Sect. 5.
We are not bound to follow the Fathers of the primitive Church. It now
remains that we show,

That the Church of Rome is, of all Churches, the most opposite unto Chastity,
by the confession of their own Authors.
SECT. 5.
15 A profession of virginity without true chastity, is no better than an
Apple growing in the lake of Sodom: because the true Church of God (which has
the title of holy and Catholic) must be discerned by the sanctity and
equity of her laws and practice. In the which respect we adventure to convent
Rome (this great patroness of virginity,) and to prove her an extreme enemy
unto chastity, which the servants of her own family (we need no others) do
plentifully discover.

16 First, indirectly (although not vnknowingly) she by their bondage of vows
has engendered such a spawne of luxury, that her own children have complained
of her Votarists, that See confessed above, lib. 1. ca. 2. Sect. 36.
many (for want of liberty to marie) dissemble their filthy commixtures: Ibidem.
few being free from forntcation, yea Ibidem.
scarce one of fifty chaste: and Ibidem.
innumerable incestuous: in that extremity that their Clemangius (one greatly
See the testim^nie following.
commended by their Trithemius) inueighed (although somewhat immoderately,
says their Bishop) against the late corruption in this Church, esteeming their

inter ancillarum Dei sanctuaria, and Veneris victimarum prostibula, iuuenumque
ad libidines explendas receptacula; denique inter puellam velare, and public
ad scortandum exponere. Espencaeus de Continent. lib. 2. cap. 12. page 217.
Nunneries no better than slewes; and places ordained for sanctuaries of
virginity, to differ nothing from the brothels of Venus. These are two general
abuses, and such as can admit no remedy, but that which the Spirit of God has
prescribed, (for so many of her own Doctors have judged) viz. It is better to
mary: which notwithstanding her stomach loatheth.

17 The next is a more direct patronage of uncleanness, by priuiledging of
Stews, whereof a See confessed above, lib. 1. ca. 2. Sect. 36.
principal one was builded by Pope Sixtus. No Protestant shall need to
declaime against this wickedness, their own Bishop Espencaeus being so large
in this argument, and now desirous to possess this Scene alone. Facere non

Espencaeus de Contin. lib. 3. c. 4. page 236.
We cannot but blush (says he) hereat, to think that our Christian

nor could adultery find therein any impunitie, before the sect of the
Pharisees did rule; yet this filthiness (speaking of the professed whoredom)
they never left unpunished unto this day. Nay, (which may be unto heaven and
earth an astonishment) a Jewish maid renounced her religion to become
Christian, to the end, that she might with license practice this art of
Ribaldrie: but we had rather follow Caligula than Alexander, who (being an
heathen man) would not suffer the tribute or custom, received from such
Brothellers, to be brought into his treasury.

Pope Paulus the third, anno 1538. and perceived a greater corruption in this
kind than was in any other city: which Pope Paulus the fourth (whom I informed
hereof) did not remove. Well, we cannot but be offended, to see so many

19 The author of this complaint was a Romanist, a Bishop, an eyewitness, and
inueighed against this abomination, not as a Satyrist (in delight to reproach
or reprove) but as a devout Ecclesiastes, from a cordolio, (as himself
professes) that is, not from the spirit of bitterness, but from the
bitterness of spirit, deploring the public and horrible iniquity of their
Church herein.

20 When we consider these so common, public, and grievous outcries of their
own men, against the whole fry of Monks, Nunneries, cucullists, and other
brothellers, we are occasioned to marvel at their foreheads, as often as they
exclaim against the lawful marriage of Protestant Ministers, calling them, even
for their mariage-sake, See above lib. 1 ca. 2. Sect. 36. and

heretics: not considering that it pleases God to suffer sometime the
greatest Adversaries unto the chastity of such marriage to foam out their own
shame and adultery; as befell unto their Cardinal Cremensis, who being the
Popes Legate, and coming to London, there to remove married Priests from their
Cures, after the receiving of the host, Ad Pascha Johannes Cremensis
Cardinalis Romans descendit in Angliam, -- celebrauit Conc. solenne apud

was found the same night committing folly with an whore: the fact was so
evident (says their Historian) that it could not be denied.

CHAP. X. Of the denial of the enjoined times of Penance.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The denial of enjoined times of Penance, in the heretics called Theodoret.
l. 4. haer. and Fab. de Audianis, reproves them, saying, Deinde confessis,
etc. They give remission to such as are confessed, without prescribing tim^ of
penance, as the laws of the Church command.
Audians.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Freeing themselves from the note of heresy in this
point: by the testimony of Antiquity.
SECT. 1.
Whatsoever almost their Cardinal Haeresis Audianorum suit (vt ex Theod. l. 4.
de fabulis haeret. intelligi potest) confessione^ peccatonim iubebat, and
absolutionem largiebatur, sed nullam iniungebat poenitentibus mulctam. Bellar.
l. 3. de Poenit. c. 1. initio.
Bellarmine does suggest, that these Apologists usually swallow without due
digestion, not well understanding whereof they affirm; for Epiphanius notes
the Audiani only to have been separatists from the Church, and otherwise to
have held Et si videbant aliquem in voluptatibus ac delicijs viuentem, aut
aliquem adulterantem Ecclesiasticam praedicationem and Ecolefiae statuta, non
forebat hic vir, sed verbis, veluti dixi, reprehendebat. Et erat hoc grave
adruodum his, qui vitam approbatam non habebant, atque hac de causa contumelijs
afficiebatur, contradictionem sustinebat, odio habebatur. -- Seipsum ab
Ecclesia separat, multique simul cum ipso discedunt. Et sic diuisionem fecit,
cum nihil haberet in fide diuersum, sed rectissime crederet and ipse, and
sodales ipsius. Etiamsi id dicere maxim oportet, in partio quodam ipsum
contentiose ferri, itemque eius asseclas. Epiphan. contra hoeres. Tom. 1. lib.
3. cap. 70. page 240.
no doctrine different from the do^trine of the Church: and were therefore in
the opinion of S. Augustine, Quos Epiphamus appellat schis^aticos potius quam
haereticos. August. T^m. 6. h^res. 5^. be says no more.
rather schismatics than heretics. But we are referred unto Theodoret, who
charge them with not performing the laws of the Church in the enjoined times
of fasts. As though the breach of every Ecclesiastical constitution did make
an heresic; as well may they say, that every transgression of a statutelaw is
properly a rebellion.

2 Howsoever they; yet Protestants (as their Cardinal has acknowledged) Ipsi
autem aduersarij (spea^ing of Pr^t^stants) licet satisfactiones (...))
reijciunt, tamen opera externa in signum poenitentiae, non reijciunt. Bellarm.
lib. 1. de Poeni^. (...). 8.. Ipsi autem.
do not reject external and laborious works of Penance: but require them, as
signs of men's repentance. Neither indeed, do they profess to admit scandalous
offenders, before they have expressed their contrition by some outward and
satisfiable tokens of repentance: and can we but suppose a Time, wherein the
laborious works must be done?

That the Romanists, by thus taxing the Audiani, have made themselves gutltie
of other heresies of the Audiani.
SECT. 2.
3 Because the Apologists labor to convince the Audiani, and in them all
Protestants to be heretics; (as though every point which Theodoret does ins^it
among the errors of the Andiani, did deserve to be stamped with the n^m^ of
heresy,) we desire to hear Theaoret prosecuting the Audiani more at large: Hi
autem iactant, se peccata remittere: postquam enim sacros libros vna cum
adulterinis bipartito diuisetint, cos enim mirandum in modum arcanos and
mysticos existanant, and hinc and illinc perve^sus posuerint, iubent
vnumquemque inter cos transire, and quae a se peccata sunt confiteri; deinde
con^essis donant remissionem, non tempus ad poenitentiam, vt iubent leges
Ecclesiae praescribentes, led sua potestate condonantes. Theod lib. 3. haeret.
fab. Tit. De Audianis. Tom. 2.
These (says he) boast that they can forgive sins: for after that they have
divided the sacred books from the adulterous, they judge them (namely the
sacred) to be exceedingly dark and mystical: and when they have put one verse
by an other, then they command their Disciples to pass through them, and to
consesse what sins they have committed: so they give them remission of their
sins, without prescribing them any time of penance, according as the laws of
the Church do command.

4 Thus far Theodoret. Now we demand of our Adversaries, what point of
heresy they can pick out of these particulars? Will they call the Audiani
heretics for boasting that they could forgive sins? or for calling the
sacred books (of Scripture, for such it seems they were) mystical and
exceeding dark? or for commanding every one to confess their sins? The
guiltiness of our Adversaries in all these will not permit them to give this
censure: yet are these mingled with the article which has been objected. And
yet furthermore

The Romanists are found partly guilty of the same error, which they have so
particularly objected.
SECT. 3.
5 The only error they will fasten upon, is their transgressing the laws of
the Church, prescribing times of penance: Now our See above lib. 2 cap. 15.. 4.
Adversaries have confessed, that the law of the ancient Church was, first to
enjoin penance before they gave remission of sins, (and this is
Gods'methode, first, Bring forth the fruits of repentance:) but the now Church
of Rome (as our See ibidem.
Adversaries have confessed) does firs^t absolve, and then enjoin penance. And
thus by their strict condemning of the Audiani, they are themselves become
heretics in some other points, and in the objected Article are but
preposterous Catholics.

CHAP. XI. of the difference of Merit.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The denial of the diversity of Merits, in August. de tempore, sermon. 191.
says, Iouiniani damnamus errorem, qui dicit nullam in futuro meritorum
distantiam. And Hierome l. 1. aduersus Iouin. c. 2. reproves Iouinian, for
that he taught that Marriage and Virginity were (eiusd^m Merits) of equal
merit, confessed by Pantaleon in Chronographia page 32. And S. Ambrole and
others say against Iouinian: Agrestis vlulatus est, etc. promis^ue vel^e omnia
consundere, etc. diuersorumque gradus abrogare meritorum. Hereof see further
Council. Tolense. and rescriptum Ambrosij ibidem, and aliorum ad Sintium prope
initium
Iouinian.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By freeing themselves, first in the point of Merit,
by the testimonies of their Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
MErit is a word amphibolon, and of diverse significations; sometime a See
above lib. 2 cap. 12.
it is taken properly, for opus condignitatis, that is, a work justly
deserving the reward of eternal life; sometime improperly, for opus
dignationis, that is, a work rewardable with blessedness by Gods gracious
acceptance. The Romanists presuming of the perfection of their inherent
righteousness, plead for Merit in the strict and propersence: but Protestants
defend Merit only in the large and improper acception, that is, (as Cardinal
Bellarmine testifies,) See above lib. 2. cap. 12. Sect. 4.
they allow the word Merit as it signifies a work which shall be rewarded, so
that the reward be not attributed unto the condignity or worthiness of the
worker, but unto the bounty of the rewarder.

2 And that this doctrine of Protestants, concerning the Merit of man's works,
is both more sacred, and more safe, our Appeal has See above lib. 2 cap. 12.
already justified: first, from the Fathers exposition of the term Merit;
from their demonstratiue arguments against the pride of man's meriting; and from
their disclaiming of their own Merits. Secondly, from the suffragies of a
grand inquest of Romish Doctors, who of late in their public writings have
sealed up with many protestations, the truth and security of the same
profession, of renouncing utterly the now Romish doctrine of Merit. Thus much
of the nature of Merit. Secondly,

Protestants are no Iouinians in the doctrine of the differences of Merit:
proved by the testimonies of our Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
3 That which is attributed to Iouinian for an error, is the opinion of the
Iouinianus docuit, praemia Beatorum esse paria -- Bellar de notis Eccles. cap.
9.. 12 Iouinianus. Haeresis septima asserit omnes beatos esse pares in gloria,
neque vllam esse in coelis praemiorum differentia^, quoniam nullam esse ait in
hac vita meritorum disparitatem. Huius erroris dux and Magister Iouinianus.

or any Protestant.
equality, both of men's virtues in this life, and of their reward in the
kingdom of heaven. Thus of Iouinian: but what of the Protestants? Of them the
Cardinal writes thus: Lutherani ex co, quod sibi persuadent, iustificationis
formalem causam non esse donum aliquod insusum a Deo. atque nobis adhaerens,
sed rustitiam side Christi apprehensam, -- Colligunt omnes, non esse vnum alio
iustiorem, cum omnium iustitia sit ipsa Christi iustitia, fide apprehensa.
Bellar. lib. 3. de Iustif. cap. 1. initio.
Because they are persuaded that the formal cause of man's justification is not
an infused gift, and a justice inherent, but the justice of Christ apprehended
by faith, they all gather that, Christ's justice being the same unto all,
therefore all are equally just. We ask leave to manifest this egregious
sophistication.

4 Justice is either inherent in man, which the Scriptu^e sometime calls
sanctification, or else without him by imputation of Christ his righteousness
unto man, by Caluinus vnam remissionem peccatorum, nomine iustificationis,
intelligit. Vega de Iustif. l. 15. c. 5. page 680.
remission of sins. This justice of remission of sin by imputation, the
Protestants indeed, universally teach to be equal in all men, not that all
penitent sinners are absolved from equal sins, but that they are equally
absolved from all their sins, namely that no sin be left unpardoned: even
as in debts, where one is a debtor in pence, anotherin talents, both being
forgiven, all are equally acquitted, because seeing unto both all are pardoned,
there is equally in both just nothing to pay.

5 Hereunto the Romanists our Adversaries will easily assent (for still shall
they justify our doctrine,) their Cardinal teaching from the In Baptismo, ex
sententia Scripturae, and sanctorum Patrum, -- plene and integre ad omnem
poenam and culpam delendam pastio Chr^sti applicatur. Bellar. lib. 4 de Poenit.
c. 10.. In alio. Omnem alterius vitae. tum aeternam, tum temporalem. Ibid. cap.
14.. Neque.
sense of Scripture (as he says) and judgment of ancient Fathers, that all
that are baptized are absolutely pardoned, both in respect of guilt and
punishment: (and yet those who were baptized in their full age were not equally
sinners,) yea Impossible est per poenitentiam vnum peceatu^ sine alio remitti.
-- Hoc esset contra perfectionem misericordiae Dei, cuius perfecta sunt omnia,
vt dicitur Deuteronomy. 32. Cuius miseretur, totaliter miseretur: and hoc est quod
Augustinus dicit, in libro de Poenitentia, Quaedam impietas infidelitatis est,
ab illo qui iustus, and iustitia est, dimidiam veniam sperare. Aquinas part. 3
qu. 86. ad 3.
it is impossibly (says Aquinas) that God should remit one sin alone: this
were against the perfection of his mercy, whose works are perfect, as it is
written: God does absolutely pardon, whom he pardons: which occasioned S.
Augustine to call it an unpious insid^litie to expect but an half pardon of
God, who is justice it self. The equality of this justification, Scripture,
Fathers, Adversaries, and common sense it self teaches, which is a secure and
blessed heresy.

6 But the other kind of justice, which is called the justice of
sanctification, by man's actual or habitual righteousness, this is that which
Iouinian understood, who denied the difference of good works, even as he did
deny the difference of sins, Hic omnia peccata, sicut Stoici Philosophi,
paria esse dicebat. Aug. lib. de hares. 82.
saying (says S. Augustine,) that all sins are equal. Now

Whether Protestants be Iouinians, in saying all sins are equal, is decided
by the judgment of their Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
7 We expect some among our Adversaries, who shall indight Protestants upon
this Article, for what will they not object to make them odious? And now as we
are in expectation, behold their Jesuit Campian comes in with vehemency and
confidence, and charge Protestants, saying: Hoc quoque tritum est in hac
faece, omnia peccata esse paria: sed ita (ne Storei reuiuiscant) si Deo iudice
ponderentur; ac si Deus aequiss Index oneri nostro cumulu^ potius, qu^m
leuamentum faceret, and id quod non est in re, cum sit ipse iustissimus,
e^^ggeraret: hac ^^utina non lenius ^n Deum feuerissime iudicantem deliquerit
ille caupo, qui gallum gallinac^um, quando non est opus, occiderit, qu^m
insanus ille sicarius, qui plenus Beza, Gallum Heroa Guisium, admitabili
virtute Principem, displos^ fistula clanculum interemit. Campianus Ies. Rat. 8.
page 60, 61. In this latter, Beza has been notably traduced, as has ^ene
proved. See the full Satisfaction, part. 2. chap. 6.
It is an ordinary thing for this dreggish sect to account all sins equal,
if they be weighed in Gods justice: by which their estimate he shall be thought
to offend no more against God, who kills another man's cock, then he who
murdered the Duke of Guize.

8 This accuser is canonized in their Martyrologies, and yet herein has shown
himself a false Martyr or witness, and that in print; for their own Cardinal
(speaking of the Protestants in general,) dare affirm, that Lutherani vero
non dicunt (quod sciam) virtutes esse par^s, aut peccata paria: neque negant
posse hominem crescere in fide, spe, dilectione, alijsque vi^ ^utibus, neque
dicunt non esse vnum alio maiorem, quod attinet ad eiusmodi virtutes: sed
affirmant per has virtutes neminem iustificari Bellar lib. 3. de Iustif. cap.
16. initio.
the Lutherans do not say, for ought I know (says he,) that virtues are
equal, or sins equal, neither do they deny but that a Christian may increase
in faith, hope, and love, and other virtues, although they deny that man is
justified by these. Neither is their vulgar As though to make all sins in
nature mortal, were to make them equal. See this confuted in the n^xt
Section, by the confession of their Jesuit.
exception any whit to the purpose. Thus far are they discharged. Now if any
say, that M. Campian knew more than this witness, or that this their Cardinal
was not as willing to accuse Protestants as M. Campian could be, he shall
bewray himself to be ignorant both of B. and C. The general doctrine of
Protestants being thus justifiable, they descend to accuse one in particular,
whose innocence does challenge of us an answer, showing

That the sentence of M. Luther, which they object as sacrilegious, is most
sacred and Apostolical; concerning the sanctity of the blessed Virgin.
SECT. 4.
9 Quartus est Lutheri de natali B. Mariae in com. in 1. Petri, vbi dicit,
Omnes Christianos, esse aeque sanctos, ac iustos, atq^e matter Dei. Ex quo sine
d^bio sequitur, fore omnes aeque beatos. Bellar. cap. 9. de not is Eccles..
Quartus est.
Luther said (says his accuser,) that all Christians are as just and as holy
as the mother of our Lord: whereupon it must certainly follow, that all Saints
shall be equally blessed. Luther is ready to answer: Quantumuis inter se
corporis membra omnia imparia sint, and officijs atque dignitate plurimum
distent, in eo tamen paria sunt, quod eiusdem corporis membra existunt, neque
potest oculus sibi plus in corpore iuris vindicare, quam contemptissimum
quodque, neque plus suum corpus esse affirmare, quam cuiuss^bet alterius: Ita
habet res Christianorum, qualescunque sint, sieve firmi fide, sieve infirmi, sieve
consummati moribus, sieve morbis grauati, tantum quilibet in Christo, and in
Christianismo possidet quantum alij: vnde equidem non minus possum de Christo
gloriari, quam D. Petrus, aut virgo Deipara. Perplacet sane D. Petrum nobilius
esse in Christi corpore membrum. quam sim ego: at ille rursus me non contemnit,
quod sim humilis and abiectus, quandoquidem ciusdem corporis membrum sum.
Lutherus Lect. in Romans 12. 2. Domin. ab Epiphan.
Although (says Luther) the members of the body are unequal, if they be
compared together, yet are they in this equal, that they are the members of
the same body: for the eye is no more a member of the body, than the most
mean and contemptible part, neither has it any prerogative to say, I am more
a part of the body, than any other. Semblable is the state of Christians,
whether it be that some are more firm in says, or more perfect in life than
others: yet every one has as good an interest in Christ, and Christianity, as
another. So that I my self may glory in Christ, as well as S. Peter, or the
blessed Virgin, the mother of Christ. I do most willingly grant, that S. Peter
is a more noble member in this (mystical) body of Christ, than I am; yet does
not he despise me, even because I am a member of the same body.

10 Which comparison of the diverse members of the parts of the body with
themselves, and with the body, Luther learned of S. Paul, who says: 1. Cor.
12. ver. 12. according to the Rhemish Translation.
As the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body,
whereas they be many, yet are one body, so also is Christ. And verse. 14: If the
foot shall say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it
therefore not of the body? And verse. 22: Such as we think to be the more base
members of the body, upon them we put more abundant honor. And verse. 24: And
if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; if one member glory, all
the members glory with it.

11 Well then, Luther said, compare member with member, and one is more noble
than the other: S. Paul says, there are members both more honorable, and more
bas^. Luther said, Yet all of them are equally members of the same body; S.
Paul says, The body is one. Luther said, S. Peter, although more noble, will
not despise me, although more base: S. Paul said, If one member suffer, all
suffer. Luther by saying, all members are ^qually in the essence, b^^ause the
f^^t wa^ w^ll called a member of the body, as is the hard; but not equally
according to the quality: for one ^^ more honorable than another.
equally members, showed the unity of Christians in Christ, which being an
unity, can admit no disparitie: but by saying, S. Peter is a part more noble,
and I am but a base one, he confesses that there is a manifest inequality in
these members, some being more firm in faith, and some less holy in life than
others.

12 This doctrine of more and less holy, of noble and base members, does it
certainly confirm Iouinianisme? does it not rather evidently confute and
confound it? Yet this is our Adversaries guise, whenever they light upon any
tooth of this dead Lion, they tread upon it with contempt; never considering
that as Judge. 14. 14.
out of the strong came sweetness, so in those sentences of Luther, which they
most traduce, there is commonly enclosed the most sacred truth, full of as
divine comfort as man's heart can ruminate upon. What now hinders but this
accusation against Protestants concerning this point of Iouinianisme, may be
dismissed? No: one Coccius, a late Romanist, does further pursue them; hear
therefore

An answer unto the accusation concerning the Equality of sins: from the
judgment of our Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 5.
13 Iouinianus dicebat, omnia peccata esse paria. -- Sic ^utherus: Nullum esse
peccatum veniale, sed omnia damnabilia. Coccius Thesaur. Cath. Tom. 1. lib. 8.
art. 3.
Iouinian taught (says Coccius,) that all sins are equal, which is the
doctrine of Luther, who says that no sin is in it nature venial, but all
damnable and mortal. Hardly should we have thought that any Adversary reputed
learned could have been so vulgarly witted, as to make such a consequence: All
sins are in their nature mortal, Ergo, equal. Therefore we send this their
Coccius to be catechized from the rules of common sense, according as their
own Jesuit can inform him; showing that as in the Judicial laws of the
Jews many sins were equally Respondeo gradus quidem distinguere, non genus,

poe^am constituebant, quemadmodum grauiores ad Concilium, quam ad iudicium

capital, which notwithstanding were punished with death more or less
grievous, as by strangling, heading, stoning, burning: all deadly, but yet
different: so in sins equally mortal, but equally heinous, shall all receive
punishments equally eternal, but not equally grievous. And the very position
it self, which defines every sin to be in it own nature mortal, is both
related and approved by their own See hereafter cap. 22. Sect. 4.
Doctors.

14 The sum is, that first, according unto imputative justice, all are
equally justified. Secondly, that in respect of inherent justice, all men are
not equally just. Thirdly, that Christians being compared with the whole body,
are equally members; but being compared one with another, are not equally holy.
Fourthly, that although sins be in nature (aeque peccata) that is, all
mortal, yet are they not aequaliter peccata, that is, equally heinous. These
being the principal points professed by Protestants, and so plainly verified
and justified by their own Authors, we have confirmed unto us the strength of
truth, quae magna est, and praeualet.

15 Furthermore what the undoubted profession of Protestants is concerning the
differences of holiness in the Saints of God, their schools, books, and
pulpits have sounded forth, teaching, that although among the workers in the
harvest, all receive Matthew. 20. 9.
one penie, that is, one essential eternity of blessedness; yet the degrees
of blessedness shall be imparted unto them by that proportion of Gods
merciful justice, which promised to reward every one, 2. Cor. 5. 10. and Ap^c.
2. 23.
according to their works. Which notwithstanding does not infer merit,
because God crowns (says S. Augustine.
Augustine) his gifts, not our merits, eue^ grace for grace; crowning the
differences of his sanctifying graces in men in this life, with the differences
of degree of the grace of glory in the highest heaven, ordaining them Ioh. 14.
2.
diverse mansions, predestinating them as 2. Tim. 1 20.
diverse vessels, and perpetuating them as 1. Cor. 15. 41.
diverse stars fixed in that eternal firmament of bliss: where yet there
shall, in the greater and less vessels of honor, be this equality, that every
ones Ioh. 16. 24.
joy shall be full. We are called to another trial.

CHAP. XII. Of the possibility of keeping the Law.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The denial of the commandments being possible, in certain other Hierom in
explanat. symb. ad Damasum, says, Execramur blasphemiam eorum qui dicunt
impossible aliquid homini a Deo praeceptum esse, etc. And the same words has
Austine de tempore sermon. 191. and vide Hieronymum ad Cleantium, and Council. 2.
Arausican, can. 25.
heretics of those times.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First laying down the state of the Question.
SECT. 1.
FIrst, impossible is a word too envious, therefore may it not be suffered to
pass without a slit, by distinguishing of impossibility; which is either
absolute, as though God could not perfect his creature, who has made the
Archa^gels, powers, and dominations; this were not only an heresy, but also a
perfect blasphemy. Otherwise it is taken suppositiuely, with respect unto the
will of God, as when we say, it is impossible for a man, when he will, to fly
up into heaven; not that God cannot enable man herunto, but that it stands
not with Gods ordinance, and will of wisdom, to grant man this Angelical
perfection. Which sense is proper unto this question, according as their
Sciendum tamen est ex eodem Augustino, hanc tantam iustitiae perfectionem,
quantam praeter vnum Christum, nemo hac vita vel assecutus sit, vel
assecuturus, non negandam este Deo possibilem, sed fieri ab eo posse, cuius hic
exemplum desit, quia ei omnia facilia sint, nedum possibilia, and apud eum, ac
in eius virtute cau^am habet, qua fieri possit, and in eius sapientia, quare
non factum sit: fieret autem, si tanta voluntas adh beretur, quanta sufficit
tantae rei. Esset autem tanta, si and nihil eorum quae ad iustitiam pertinent,
nos lateret, and ea sic animum delectarent, vt quicquid aliud voluptas vel
dolor impedit, delectatio illa superaret; quod vt non sit, ad Dei iudicium, non
ad impossibilitatem pertinet: sic sine exemplo est in hominibus perfecta
iustitia, nec tamen impossibilis. Espencaeus Episc. in 2. Tim. 3. page 126.
Bishop has observed out of S. Augustine, who denies that simple
impossbility, as though God could not make a man perfect in this life; but
confesses, that yet none is perfect, the cause whereof is to be reserved unto
Gods justice. And thus do all understand impossibility in this Article.

2 Secondly, by man is not meant the unregenerate; for so we might fight
without an Adversary, because the Romanists confess it an Aut certe
existimant, posse hominem seruare propri^s viribus omnia praecepta moralia, and
innocentem vitam agere secundum rationem, and hac sanctitate morali prouocare
Deum ad auxilium speciale sibi donandum, quo tandem ad fidem gratiamque
peruemat; sed haec quoque est haeresis Pelagiana, in lib. super. satis superque
refutata: vt omittam, nullum eiusmodi hominem ex historijs posse monstrari:
Catones enim, Socrates, alijque horum similes, qui inter Ethnicos sanctissimi
iudicati sunt, multis vitijs coopertos fuisse, facile demonstrati po^sit.
Bellar. lib. 6. de Great. and lib. arbit. c. 6.. Sane qui.
impossibility for a man, by his own natural power, to keep all Gods
commandments, censu^ing the contrary doctrine amongst the heresies of the
Pelagians. So now we have the proper subject of this question, man regenerate
in this life; and the predicate, it is impossible to keep all the
commandments. To this end we exhibit

A proof of the Protestants assertion, by confessed testimonies of Antiquity.
SECT. 2.
3 Cardinal Bellarmine relates the Romish doctrine in the name of them all:
Catholici omnes summa contensione contrarium docent; Fatentur enim 1. legem Dei
justice hominibus absolute esse possibilem, non quidem per solas vires liberi
arbitrij -- Secundo opera iustorum simpliciter and absolute iusta, and suo
etiam modo esse perfecta. Bellar. lib. 4. de Iustif. cap. 10. Porro.
All Catholick^ (says he) teach with a full consent, both that the just man
may absolutely fulfill the law of God, and also that the works of just men are
absolutely just, and in a manner perfect. Mark, absolutely just, and yet but
suo modo, in a manner perfect: as though it were not absolutely perfect, which
is absolutely just; o^ that were absolutely just, which is but in a manner
perfect. To give us such an (...) and contradiction in the first entrance into
a question, is like astumbling on the threshold, somewhat ominous. But to the
maine.

4 Saint Jerome was a Catholic, yet he professing to speak against a new
heresy made of an old in defense of man's perfection in this life, refuteth it:
Certe nullum sanctiorem puto leremia, virgin, Propheta sanctificato in vtero:
-- significat omnem mundum Dei indigere misericordi^, and nullum, quamuis
sanctum, pergere securum ad Iudicem: contra nouam ex veteri haeresin, quae
putat in hoc s^culo omnes simul iustum implere posse virtutes. -- Et in Psalm.
114. dicit, Placebo Domino; non, Placeo: hic enim, quicquid facio, non possum
esse perfectus iustus, quoniam in praesenti seculo perfectus iustus nemo esse
potest, nec David, nec Apostolus, nec Sanctorum aliquis. Nemo a peccato mundus,
nulli Sancti ausi sunt dicere vel, Sancti sumus, vel Placeo, sed, Placebo Deo:
vbi placebo? in regione viuorum, haec enim mortuorum regio. Vt refert Episc.
Espencaeus in 2. Tim. 4.. 18. page 124.
I think (says he) that no holy man passes out of this life, without fear,
unto Gods tribunal: and therefore will have every just man to accord unto the
Prophet David's tune, who sung, placebo, not placeo [I will please God (says
he) in the region of the living:] that is (says S. Hierome) after this life,
in heaven, because he could not say, I do please God in this life, which is the
region of the dead. And this he thinks to have been the song of all Apostles,
and holy men. Thus much S. Hierome, from the relation of their own Bishop:
whereupon we gather, that S. Hierome saying, that the most just cannot properly
please God in this life, does fully dissent from our Adversaries, who say, that
the just man may absolutely fulfill the law of God in this life.

5 Saint Augustine will not be denied to have been a Catholic, who (as their
Bishop says) reigns in this argument, and is confessed to say, that Facere
non possum, quin ex Augustino nonnihil subligam: regnat in hoc argumento: -- is
in lib. 2. de pecc. merit. and remisl. ca. 13. Potest fieri vt aliquis sit
perfectus, -- in eo quod omnes homines diligat, etiam inimicos, non in eatamen
perfectione, vt quos diligit, tantum diligat, quantu^ incommutabilis regula
veritatis diligendos esse praescripsit: nec ideo quisquam prorsus sine peccato
esse intelligitur, qui aliqua re dicitur esse perfectus; quan quam and in hoc
ita dici potest, vt non quia iam non est, quo proficiat, sed quia maxima ex
part profecit. -- Et lib. 4. cap. 11. ex Ambrosio: Videmus (inquit)
impossible esse. vt perfect quis immaculatus sit, in hoc corpore constitutus
Et lib 2. contra Iulianum; Vos festinatis, and praesumptionem vestram
festinando praecipitatis, hic enim vnltis hominem perfici, and vtinam Dei dono,
non libero, sed seruo potius arbitrio, a qua perfectione long vos esse
sentitis: sed dolus est in ore vestro, sieve peccatores vos esse dicatis, and
iustos credi velitis, sieve profiteamini perfectionem iustitiae, quam profecto
in vobis non esse sentitis. Ex Espencaeo quo supra, page 125.
a man cannot love God, as much as the inviolable rule of truth does prescribe:
with diverse other sentences to the same effect. And doubtless, as long as S.
Augustine reigns in this argument, Protestants cannot possibly fail in their
cause: for he, in despair of perfection by the law, teaches every one to fly
unto the perfection of the Gospel, after the example of just Et si est aliquod
peccatum, quod vitari non possit, quo modo iustus Deus dicitur, si imputare
cuiquam creditur, quod vitari non possit? Respondemus iam olim contra superbos
esse clamatum; Beatus, cui non imputauit Dominus peccatum: -- Peccatum est
autem, cum vel non est charitas, quae esse d^bet, vel minor est, quam debet,
sieve hoc voluntate vitari possit, s^ue non possit: quia si potest, praesens
voluntas hoc facit; si autem non potest, praeterita voluntas hoc fecit; and
tamen vitari potest, non quando voluntas superba laudatur, sed quando humilis
adiuuatur. -- Quando autem possit, and per quem possit, hoc quaeritur. Si enim
modo est, non omni animae fideli positae in corpore mortis huius orandum est,
and dicendum, Dimitte nobis debita nostra: cum iam in sancto Baptismo vniuersa
fuerint dimissa praeterita. Quisquis autem membris fidelibus Christi hoc non
esse orandum persuadere conatur, nihil aliud quam seipsum Christianum non esse
profitetur. August Tom 7. lib. de perfectaustit. ad rat. 15. and 16.
David, saying, Blessed is the man, unto whom the Lord imputes no sin.

6 Ambrose was a Catholic Bishop, whose testimony their Bishop has inserted,
out of S. Augustine, viz. See a little before at the letter, c.
We seee it to be impossible (says Ambrose) for any man living in this life,
to be perfect and spotless.

7 Saint Bernard, a Father of later times, and appropriated by these
Apologists, as an absolute Romanist; whom, as they hold him to have been a
Saint powerful in See above,
Miracles, so do we acknowledge him to have been (in comparison of that
generation among whom he lived) a miraculous Saint: hear we then the
profession of a Saint: Nam in affectu, quis ita habet charitatem, vt mandatur?
ergo illa mandatur ad meritum, illa in pramium datur: cuius initium quidem
profectumqm; vitam quoque praesentem experiri diuina posse gratia, non negamus:
sed plane consummationem defendimus futurae foelicitatis. Quomodo ergo iubenda
fuit, quae implenda nullo modo erat? aut si placet tibi magis de affectuali
datum fuisse mandatum, non inde contendo, dummodo acquiescas and tu mihi, quod
minime in vita ista ab aliquo hominum possit, vel potet^t adimpleri: quis enim
sibi arrogare id audeat, quod Paulus ipse fatetur se non comprehendisse? Nec
latuir praeceptorem, praecepti pondus hominum excedere vires: sed iudicauit
ille vtile ex ipso suae illos insufficientiae admoneri, and vt sci^ent save ad
quem iustitiae finem niti pro viribus oporteret. Ergo mandando impossibilia,
non praeuaricatores homines fecit, sed humiles, vt omne os obstruatur, and
subditus fiat omnis mundus Deo: quia ex operibus legis non iustificabitur omnis
caro coram illo: accipientes quippe mandatum, and sentientes defectum,
clamabimus in coelu^, and miserebitur nostri Deus: and sciemus in illa die, qua
non ex operibus iustitiae, quae fecimus nos, sed secundu^ sua^ misericordia^
saluos nos fecit. Bernar. super Cant ser. 50. p. 931.
No man (says S. Bernard) can fulfill the law of God in this life. Then
preventing an objection, which our Adversaries do ordinarily use. Does God then
command things impossible? he grants it, but yet so, that God thereby does
not make man a transgressor, but humbles him, to the intent that man
perceiving his own defect, might in renouncing his righteousness by works,
fly unto Gods mercy and grace. And indeed, the law is not to be called
impossible for man, a quo, from whom original sin came: (Adam being created
in a perfection might have had a posse non peccare) but in respect of man, in
quo, in whom the rebellious corruption does now dwell (until it be divorced by
death,) whereby he has in one degree or other a non posse non peccare, until
he come unto the region of the living, where only there is non posse peccare,
that is, an impossibility of sinning.

8 We forbear accumulation of testimonies: these already mentioned will
plainly show how far the true and ancient Catholics did differ from the
newly pretended, by the difference of their language (as S. Jerome his Cannot
please God in this life; and S. Augustines, Cannot love according to the
prescript of the law; and S. Ambrose his, It is impossible to be perfect; and
S. Bernard his, It is impossible to fulfill the law:) if they be compared with
the aboue-specified Romish Article, viz. A just man may absolutely fulfill the
law of God. Hear furthermore

The Protestants doctrine ratified by some Romanists.
SECT. 3.
9 Doctor Stapleton, although he sweat in defending the possibility of
keeping the law, yet (as though his breath had failed him) we hear him
panting: Haec tamen impletio legis non intelligitur necessario and praecise in
omnibus mandatis legis, toto tempore and cursu iustitiae humanae; sed ille
censetur implere legem, satisfacere legi, and in conspectu Dei iustus habetur,
qui voluntatem and affectum habens implendi vniuersa legis, eatenus implet,
quatenus humana fragilitas in reliqu: js naturae corruptae, per gratiam implere
in hac vita vel potest, vel solet. Haec propositio manifest confirmatur per
celeberr. illam Ecclesiae doctrinam, contra Pelagianos olim definitam: neminem
etiam iustorum in hac vita sine peccato viuere. Stapleton de Iustific. lib. 6.
de perfect. Iustit. c 3. initio.
Yet this fulfilling of the law (says he) is not to be understood necessarily
and precisely of all the commandments of the law, in the whole course of man's
justice: but he may be said to satisfy the law, and to be just in the sight of
God, who has a will and affection to fulfill all the commandments, so far
as the infirmity of nature, strengthened by grace, will permit. And in the end
he yields unto the doctrine of the Church long since established against the
Pelagians, which teaches that no man lives without sin. This Doctor, his
[not precisely fulfilling the law of God] cannot but fight against their
general position, of absolutely fulfilling the law of God.

10 Ferus, a Friar of the order of the Minorites, and commended by their
Senensis for See the Catalogue of authors, before the book, Tit. Ioh. Ferus.
a man notably skillful in holy scriptures, and the most singular Preacher of
his time in all Germany; writing many godly and learned books, which accord
with Catholic doctrine, and are now diligently read of almost all Preachers:
this Author cannot but prove an honorable witness, in that which he shall
auerre: who in his Comment upon the Acts, printed at Paris, Anno 1568. cum
priuilegio, calls the moral law of God an importable burden; first because
it commands not only the hand, that is, the action, but also the heart, that
is the affection: secondly because it conuinceth us of sin, seeing we do more
against the law, than according to the law; and that good which we do, is but
imperfectly performed. Here is confessed not only, imperfectly done, which
they call venial; but also a working against the law, which cannot agree with
the absolute fulfilling of the law.

b.
Bucer, and Calvin, could not but pass among the Romanists, for a singular
Catholic in that time; yet he prosecuting this argument at large, does resolve
thus: Duplex considerari potest iustitia, sicut du plex inuenitur regula, cui
conformari debeant: altera qua iusti sunt coram hominibus; altera est iustitia,
qua iusti sunt coram Deo. -- Quod tamen trifariam fere intelligere possumus,
vel quod nostra iustitia cum diuina conferatur, and velut in contentionem
reuocetur iustitia. -- Hoc sane pacto in conspectu Deisolus inuentus est iustus
Agnus ille sine macula, de quo in Apoc. Paulo post: -- Vel intelligitur homo
iustificari coram Deo hoc est, coram tribunali diuini iudicij, dum regulae
diuinae iustitiae, qua part ipsum respicit, exact respondet. Regulam autem
illam diuinam esse legem, indubitatum est. Porro and illam dupliciter
intelligere possumus, vel in sua illa absoluta perfectione, secundum quam hoc
mortis corpus adhuc circumferentibus nobis, velut scopus quidam, in quem
collimare perpetuo debeamus, ad quem semper conari, and nos exercere q^o
accedamus vicinius, magis proponitur, quam sub obligatione e^igitur. -- Ipse
onim nouit figmentum nostrum, nec ignorant quoniam puluis sumus, and proinde
nostrae fragilitati prorsus impossibilia, a nobis non exigit. Pi^s pater est,
and miserico^s Dominus, non immitis ac rigidus exactor coru^, quae vires
nostras, quas ab ipso accepimus, plane superant. Vel prout illa ipsa diuinae
iustitiae lex and regula nos respiciens, nostrae infirmitati aptata
condescendit, and conuenit. -- Primo modo, in conspectu Dei non iustificatur
omnis viuens, and mortale adhuc corpus, quod aggrauat animam circumferens: in^o
and iustitiae nostrae hoc pacto iniquitates inuenientur, and velut pannus
menstruatae omnes, plurimumque deficere ab exacta illa and absoluta iustitia.
Et paulo post: -- Sed and secundo modo, si regulam illam diuinae iustitiae,
etiam quatenus nostrae infirmitati attemperata est, intelligas ex voluntatis
humanae inconstantia and inclinatione quadam ad carnis sui hospitis amica, --
and quae ab illa lege diuinae iustitiae nos deflectere -- nunquam cessat, adhuc
inuenire non est iustum quenquam coram Deo inter Adae filios; sed verum
reperietur etiam de hac ipsa, quamuis imperfecta iustitia, quod non
iustificabitur in conspectu Dei omni^ viuens: siquidem iustitia haec est ad
suam regulam, etiam nostrae infirmitati attemperatam, exacta correspondentia,
and commensuratio in actionibus nostris omnibus. Postea etiam: -- Itaque cum
suam nemo mortalium proferre possit iustitiam, qua rectitudini diuinae legis
exact respondeat, sed iniustitiae potius ab ea conuincatur, and proinde
maledicto atque irae diuinae (cui subiecti sunt legis transgressores)
inueniatur obnoxious: auersatur enim ille omnem iniustitiam. -- Et paulo post:
Quidigitur? hoc nempe, quod D. Augustinus, vt libera, ita verissima voce
pronunciat, Vae, inquit, hominum vitae, quantumcunque laudabili, si remota
misericordia iudicetur: nam cum nemo sit, quem, si ad regulam diuinae iustitiae
exigas etiam illam, quam diximus imperfectiorem, and nostrae fragilitati
attemperatam, ad quam exigimur merito, non iniquus and iniustus comprobetur,
nemo sit cui sua constet iustitia, nemo qui non iniustitiae conuincatur,
quamuis iustissimus inter homines: Iniustitiae vero iusta sit merces
exterminiu^, sit mors stipendium, actum sane de nobis omnibus fuerat, nisi
diu^ina nobis misericordia succurreret, ignoscens quotidie, quod ex part
nostra minus est. Paulo post: -- Nam quod non in operibus nostris, non in
iustitia nostra, sed in vna ignoscente iniquitates nostras misericordia,
beneuolentiae e^ga nos diuinae, and salutis a Deo assequendae nobis spes sit,
Dauidis testimonio Apostolus ad Romans comprobans, Non alia iustitia niti nos
posse, ni^i quam imputat nobis, absque nostris operibus affirmat, Beati,
inquit, etc. Pigghius de fide and iustif. controu. 2. page 45, 46, 47.
There is a double justice, one before men, (which is, to deal uprightly with
all men;) another before God, which may be considered either by making
comparison with God himself (in which respect the Angels are unclean,) and so
Christ only is the just one: or else comparing our life and justice with Gods
law unto man, which law is the rule of justice. Again, this law may be
understood either in the full perfection of it, which is propounded unto man as
a scope still to aim at, rather than a bond of Obligation, by exacting
answerable obedience; because God knowing our infirmity does not exact of us
that which is impossible. But why? He is a gracious Father, no rigid exactor of
those things, which do indeed exceed our strength.

12 Secondly, (says he) the same law may be considered, as it is applied, and
modified, with respect unto our infirmity: then he determines the question; In
the first respect (as the law requires perfection,) no flesh can be justified,
but man's righteousness is no better than a menstruous cloth. In the second
consideration, as the law i^ tempered and qualified unto man's infirmity, and
imperfect obedience, yet is not man justifiable before God hereby: in brief,
no mortal man can show his justice answerable (meaning in ^ither respect) unto
the direction of Gods law, but stands convicted of injustice, and thereby is
under Gods malediction, due unto sin, and perishes, except God in his mercy
grant him daily pardon for his offenses. This witness concludes with us, that
whether the law of God be taken in the rigor, or in the temper; yet no man is
a fulfiller of the law: therefore, if he hope to be saved, must according to
Pigghius his conclusion, renounce all his justification by his own
righteousness, and fly unto the justification by faith, through the
righteousness of Christ Jesus, impu^ed unto us.

13 And thus one of the greatest Adversaries of the Protestants is become one
of their greatest Advocates, in desending of justification by faith only, the
greatest Article of the religion of Protestants. Which has been confirmed by
the consent of diverse Romanists, notwithstanding it do flatly contradict this
position of the absolute fulfilling of the law: yet lest they may be thought to
have some evasion, by distinction of sin, we refer our Reader unto an ample
See hereafter cap. 22. Sect. 4.
confutation hereof; and for this present, wish him to be content to see

The objected places against Protestants satisfied, and their Adversaries
entangled.
SECT. 4.
14 This Article of the impossibility of keeping Gods command, according to
the difference of construction, is both damnably blasphemous, and infallibly
true; the state of man being threefold: one is his first creation; to say that
it was impossible then for man to have kept the commandment, was the
blasphemy of the Manichees. The second is his fall, and bondage in sin; and
to deny that it is impossible for man, without grace, to keep the
commandment, was the blasphemy of the Pelagians. His third station is his
state of grace, wherein man's keeping of the commandment, has a double aspect;
first it looks upon the right side of Gods mercy, who according to his
fatherly acceptance in Christ, vouchsafes the imperfect obedience of his
children, who still contend unto perfection: and to call this keeping of Gods
commandment impossible, both Fathers and Protestants do judge to be an
heretical opinion. Secondly it beholds God on the lest side, cying only the
strictness of his justice according to the exact rigor of his own law; and to
believe that man can possibly keep the law so exactly, is a Pelagian heresy
condemned by the Fathers.

15 Saint Qua ratione potest esse quod vel^t, cum Apostolus asserat se quod
cupiat implere non posse? cumque ab eis quae^imus, qui sint illi, quos ab^que
peccato putent, noua stropha eludere veritatem: se no^ cos dicere, qui sint vel
fuerint, sed qui esse possint. Egregij doctores, dicunt esse posse, quod
nunquam fuisse demonstrant. Hieron. Tom. 2 aduersus Pelag. ad C^esiphon. page
251. Observe, that although the Pelagians defended the perfection of natural
faculties, yet here both they and S. Hierome speak of perfection in general;
which general does imply both the state corrupted and restored, as is plain
by the instances used by S. Hierome. Sin difficilia, cur ausus es facilia
dicere, quae nullus impleuerit? non intelligis tuas inter se repugnare
sententias? -- Zacharias and tales iustificantur, non quod omni vitio careant,
sed quod maiore pa^te virtutum commendentur. Hieron. ibid. As S. Hierome argue^
of facilia, so may we of possibilia.
Jerome requires them who professed such perfection of obedience, to instance
but in any one man, who ever kept the commandments: and when they answered,
that although none did keep the law, yet any might; he holds their answer
ridiculous, as if they should say (says he,) that may be done, which they
cannot show was ever done. Many Romanists are guilty of thi^ heresy, of which
kind their own Bishop complained: Sunt enim hodi^ qui status and homines in
perfectione iustitiae tantum non aequent Angelis, nouae scilicet veteris
Pelagianismi reliquiae: qua haeresi vt nulla vel periculosior, vel
pe^niciosi^^, aut perpetuae gratiae Christi necessitati magis contraria, ita
nulla vel minus extincta, vel plus rediuiua. Episc. Espencaeus com. in 2. Tim.
cap. 4.. 18. page 121.
There are at this day who equal the state of men, in perfection of justice,
with the perfection which is next unto the Angels, which is one of the relics
of Pelagianisme; than the which as no heresy can be more pernicious, so is
there old heresy more revived at this day. Near unto this is that sound of
perfection, which we have heard, even an absolute fulfilling of the law of God,
according unto the exact rule of his justice.

CHAP. XIII. Of Exorcisme.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
The denial of Exorcisme and Exufflation used in Baptism, was condemned
likewise in August. de nuptijs and concupiscentia, l. 2. c. 29. says, Iulianus
antiquissimam Ecclesiae traditionem nefario crimine aspergit, qua exorcizantur,
and vt dixi, exuff^lantu^ paruuli: and vide Aug. ibidem l. 2. c. 17. and contra
Julian. Pelag. l. 6. c. 2.
Iulianus the Pelagian.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Freeing them from heresy in this point.
SECT. 1.
EXorcisme was in, and long after the time of the primitive Church, so visible
and miraculous a power of expelling of Devils by adiuration, that S. Cyprian in
his days durst challenge Demetrianus to come and try what was the virtue
thereof in the Church: Quod autem Scapulae Tertullianus, hoc Demetriano sic
suggessit Cyprian is: O si audire eos velles, quando a nobis ad^utantur,
torquentur spiritualibus flagris, verborum tormentis de obsessis corporibus
eijciuntur eiulantes and gementes, voce humana, and potestate diuina flagella
and verbera sentientes, venturu^ iudiciu^ confitentur. Veni and cognosce vera,
quae dicimus, vel ipsis, quos colis, creed, vel tibi, si volueris: videbis nos
ab eis rogari, quos rogas, timeri, quos times. Espencaeus in 1. Tim. Digress.
l. 1. c. 14. page 231.
So shall thou perceive (says he) that the Devils fear us, whom thou fear.
Which was so manifest and sensible, that S. Ambrose said, Ambrosius sermon. 91.

None could suspect therein any cousenage, or deceit: which their Bishop
Espencaeus notes to have been Ac ne de baptizandis quidem prius exorcizatis,
and adiuratis, praeceptum in sacra Scriptura expressum, quanta tamen fuerit

15. page 235.
used in those times, both in Baptism, and out of Baptism, by those who were
endewed with the gift of Exorcization. Exsufflation, or puffing with the mouth,
was but Exsufflatio est ceremonia annexa Exorcismo -- nam verbis Exorcismorum
expelluntur Daemones, and caeremonia exufflationis significatur eorum expulsio.
Bellar. lib. 1. de Baptis. c. 15.. Septima.
a ceremony annexed unto Exorcisme, in signification that the Devil was
expelled: but our question is whether this Exorcisme be necessary in Baptism?
Their Durand says, that Et est notandum, quod (...) graece, lati^e dicitur
Adiuratio, vt est illud, Exi ab eo immunde Spiritus. Catechismus autem and
Exorcismus Neophytorum sunt; praecedunt enim Baptismum, and magis debent dici
Sacramentalia, quam Sacramenta. i. ad sacramentum Baptismi pertinentia, vel
praeludia noui Baptismi: sine eis tamen potest esse Baptismus. Durandus lib. 6.
Rational. cap. 82. page 687. number. 8.
Exorcisme is but a Sacramental adiunct, and no Sacrament; and that Baptism
is perfect without it.

2 Where then was the heresy of Iulianus the Pelagianist? S. Augustine
shows, that he Sed perfect Pelagianus est, qui malum originale non credit.
Neque enim ex quo esse coepit Manichaei pestilentiosa doctrina, ex illo
coeperunt in Ecclesia Dei paruuli baptizandi exorcizari, and exufflari, vt
ipsis mysterijs ostenderetur, non eos in regnu Christi nisi erutos a tenebrarum
potestate, transferri. August. Tom. 7. de Nupt. and Concupisc. l. 2. c. 29.
page 855.
did not believe that children are conceived in original sin, and that
consequently by nature they are not the sons of wrath, and of the Devil:
therefore did he contemn Exorcisme, and Exsufflation, by which mysteries there
is signified (says S. Augustine,) that children, except they be freed first
from the power of darkness (which is the Devil) they cannot enter into the
kingdom of Christ. Therefore the marrow of his error was the denial of man's
natural corruption, and the power of Gods grace in man's regeneration: for the
which cause the Protestants, with the whole Church of God, have always
condemned that Iulianus for a most pestilent heretic.

3 As for Exorcisme, we may thus determine: It was in ancient times a
miraculous and extraordinary gift, and a sensible expulsion of Devils, which
gift is long sithence See this largely proved, and confessed above, lib. 3.
cap. 17, 18, 19. and deinceps.
ceased: but now Exorcisme is an ordinary imitation of that same gift, which
in these days is out of date. Then it was, upon just occasions, necessary,
now in Baptism it is held not necessary by our Adversaries themselves, in
whose Church many millions of infants are baptized without Exorcisme, or
Exufflation, except they shall admit their women-Baptists into the order of
their Exorcists.

4 Notwithstanding, Exorcisme and Exufflation, being a tradition so ancient,
and containing a sign of man's deliverance out of the power of Satan, may
according unto the discretion of diverse Churches, be used or omitted; and so
it is, for Non habent donum expellendi Daemonia, qualis igitur apud ipsos est
ordo exorcistarum? Chemnis. part. 2. examen. Conc. Trid. page 219. Traditiones

Protestants use it, where they think it may be well retained without
scandal; As in England.
others, for fear of superstition, omit it. And whosoever shall for a ceremony
of such indifferency as Exufflation is, wholly condemn any for heretics,
either for the use, or disuse thereof, such an one (we say no more) merito est
exufflandus.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: First showing what was the doctrine of the Donatists.
SECT. 1.
TRuly have our Adversaries observed from S. Augustine, that the doctrine of
the Donatists consisted in three points; First, the persons: See Bellarm*
confessing this in the Sections following.
They thought that the Church did consist only of just men: Secondly, for the
place, Si autem vniuersos Donatistas non audiuimus, se pro Ecclesia Christi
supponentes, quia nullum pro se de diuinis libris testimonium proferunt, quo id
doceant: quanto minus, to go te, Rogatistas audire debemus, qui nec illud pro
se interpretari conabuntur, quod scriptum est, Vbi pascis, vbi cubas in
meridie? Cant. 17. Si enim hoc loco Scripturarum meridies Africa intelligenda
est, in part Donati, quae sub coeli feruentiori plaga est, omnes vos
Maximianistae superabunt, quorum schisma in Bizantio, and in Tripoli exarsit.
Sed confligant cum eis Arzuges, and hoc magis ad se pertinere contendant;
Mauritania tamen Caesariensis, occidentali quam meridianae patti vicinior,
quando nec Africam se vult dici, quomodo de meridie gloriabitur? non dico
aduersus orbem terrarum, sed aduersus ipsam partem Donati, vnde pars Rogati
breuisl. frustum de frusto maiore praecisum est. Quis autem non impudentissime
n^tatur aliquid in allegoria positum pro se interpretari, nisi habeat and
manifesta testimonia, quotum lumine illustrentur obscura? Iustus Calumus,
alias, Barontus de unit. Romans Eccles. page 116. 117. ex epist. 48 Augustini.
That there was no Church but in Afric. Thirdly, their reason only from an
allegorical and perverse exposition of Scripture, because Christ answering his
spouse in the Canticles, where he lies? he said, in meridie, that is, in the
South; the Donatists concluding thereupon, that the Church was wholly perished
from the earth, and only professed in the South of Afric among themselves:
whom S. Augustine did learnedly confute. This is the Donatian heresy. Now see
unfolded

The diverse Traducements, used by the Romanists against Protestants, to bring
them into the guilt of Donatisme.
SECT. 2.
2 Many of our Romish Adversaries look upon the doctrine of Protestants, but
some more sinisterly than others: for some of them, supposing the Protestants
to teach an absolute apostasy of the universal Church of Christ, have bent
all their forces to confute them; but (as their Cardinal teslifieth) Notandum
autem est, multos cx nostris teinpus terere, dum probant absolute Ecclesiam non
posse deficere: nam Caluinus and caeteri haeretici id concedunt, sed dicunt,
intelligi debere de Ecclesia inuisibili. Bellar. l. 3. de Eccles. milit. cap.
13. initio. So that the Rhemists annot. in 1. Tim. 3. ver. 15. Reinolds
Caluino. Turc. l. 1. c. 10. and others, may seem herein to have swet in vain.
with lost labor, because Protestants teach (says he) that the invisible
Church of Christ can never perish.

Their second Traducement.
SECT. 3.
3 Although the Cardinal will seem to be more conscionable, by restraining
his speech unto the Church visible, yet is his accusation notably calumnious.
First, Donatiste Ecclesiain ex solis justice constare volebant, atque inde
d^duceba^t, Ecclesiam visisibilem perijsle de toto orb terrarum, and in sola
Africa remansisse, vt August docet, lib. de unit. Eccles. c. 12. -- Eand^ esse
doctrinam and vitam Caluinistarum, certum est: nam Ecclesiam ex solis bonis
constare, docet Caluinus lib. 4. Inst. c. 1.. 7. quod etiam docet articulus 7.
confessionis Augustanae, Ecclesiam visibilem a multis seculis perijsle, and
nunc solum inseptentrionalibus esse, vbi ipsi sunt, docent omnes, and praecipue
Caluinus l. 4. Inst. c. 2.. 2. Bellar. l. 4. de notis Eccles. cap. 9..
Donatistae.
The Donatists (says he) taught, that the Church consists only of godly
men, and thereupon gathered that it was perished from the face of the earth,
remaining only among themselves in Afric: So Calvin teaches, that the
Church consists only of good men.

4 So Calvin? Let us hear Calvin speak, In the volume of the same book:
Fuerunt enim semper, qui falsa absolutae sanctimoniae persuasione imbuti,
tanquam acrij quidam daemones iam facti essent, omnium hominum consortium
aspernarentur, in quibus humanum adhuc aliquid subesse cernerent, tales enim
erant Cathari, and (qui ad little vesaniam accedebant) Donatistae.
There are certain aerit devils (says he) such as are the Cathari, and after
them the Donatists, who upon a presumption of their own sanctity, separate
themselves from others. And he A little after: Peccant illi, -- quia enim non
putant esse Ecclesiam, vbi non est solida vitae puritas, and intcgritas,
scelcrum odio a legitima Ecclesia discedunt, dum a factione improborum
declinare se putant: Allegant etc. Caluinus Institut. lib. 4. cap. 1.. 13.
refelleth the ground of their heresy, which is, to think that a Christian
may not continue in that Church, wherein there is not an integrity in the
Professors of the same truth. And in the very sentence alleged against him, he
Emmuero de Ecclesia visibili, and quae sub cognitionem nostra^ cadit, quale
iudicium facere conueniat, ex superioribus liquere iam existimo. Diximus enim
bifariam de Ecclesia sacras literas loqui: interdum cum Ecclesiam nominant, eam
intelligunt, quae re vera estc ora^ Deo, in quam nulli recipiuntu^, nisi qui
and adoptionis gratia filij Dei sunt, and spiritus sanctificatione, vera
Christi membra. At tunc quidem non ^antum sanctos, qui in terra habitant,
comprehendit, sed electos omnes, qui ab origin mundi suerunt. Saep^ autem
Ecclcsiae nomine vniuerlam hominum multitudinem in o^be distusam designat, quae
vnum se Deum, and Christum colere profitctut: baptismo initiatur in eius sidem,
coenae participatione vnitatem in vera doctrina and charitate testatur
consensionem habet in verbo Domini, atque ad eius praedicationem Ministerium
conteruat a Christo institutum. -- Quemadmodum ergo nobis inuisibilem, sol^us
Dei oculis conspicuam Ecclesiam credere necesse est ita hanc, quae respectu
hominum Ecclesia dicitur, obseruare ^iusque commumonem colere iubemur. Calvin.
lib. 4. Instit. cap. 1.. 7.
distinguishes between the Church, as it is visible, and as it is invisible.
The invisible he will have to consist only of the holy and elect ones (which
accords with the Article of our Creed, believing an holy Catholic Church:)
but of the visible he says, It is a conspicuous multitude, participating in
the same Sacraments, etc. Among whom he See Calcuin ibid.. 9.
confesses there are hypocrites and wicked men, although not as true members,
yet as outward professors of the same faith. Finally he has already condemned
the phrensy of the Donatists, for separating themselves from the visible
Church, because of the co^mixture of Tares with the Wheat. So that this heresy
of the Donatists, in acknowledging no visible Church, but wherein all were
outwardly holy and just, as it had never greater Adversary among the Fathers,
than S. Augustine, so had not S. Augustine ever any more zealous follower of
him herein than Calvin.

The third Traducement.
SECT. 4.
5 In the third place their Cardinal steppeth forth, and challenges Calvin
and the Augustane confessors of Donatisme: but why? Bellarmine, See above Sect.
3. b.
They teach (says he) that the Church has perished many ages by passed, and
that it is resident only in those Northern parts, where they do inhabit.
Justice commands to hear the accused parties speak for themselves: The
Itaque quae sit Ecclesia, and qualis sit, and vbi sit, haec descriptio indicat,

efficax. Confess. August. ibid. p. 138. Diximus. Impressa Arge itorati, anno
1565.
Augustane confessors confess, first, of the Catholic Church, that it is tied
unto the Gospel. Secondly, of the Romish Church, that the chief Bishops and
Pastors are idolatrous, and no members of the Church; yet that some professors
being builded upon the true foundation, are sau^d. Thirdly, of every visible
Church, that wicked professors are mixed with the godly. Fourthly, of the
Donatists, that they are worthily condemned, for reiecling the ministry of
men, who are ungodly. Which doctrines Calvin, likewise condemned, who
furthermore taxes the Romanists, for playing the Donatists, by challenging to
themselves a prerogative of truth, and tying Gods Church and truth Magnifice
illi quidem suam nobis Ecclesiam commendant, nequa alia in mundo esse videatut:
postea quasi re confecta omnes schismaticos essc constituunt, qui ab cius, quam
pingunt, Ecclesiae obedientia subducere se: omn shaereticos, qui contra eius
doctrinam mutire audent. Et paulo post: Si templum, illud quod videb^tur,
per^ctuae Dei habitationi conlcciatum, derelinqui a Deo, and prophanescere
potuit. non est quod nobis isti singant, Deum ita personis au^ ^ocis alligatum,
and affixum externis obseruationibus, vt manner apud cos oporteat, qui titulum
modo and speciem Ecclesiae habent. Caluinus Institut. lib. 4. cap. 2.. 2. and 3.
unto certain persons and places: as though God had bound himself to reside
with them.

6 Compare we now the Donatists and Protestants together: the Donatists said,
that the visible Church admits no mixture of wicked with the godly; the
Protestants deny this. The Donatists held the Church visible to be
itremoueable from Afric: the Protestants confute that. The Donatists taught
the Church to be so properly and peculiarly tied unto one place, that th^re
cannot possibly be elsewhere any true Church: the Protestants condemn this,
who hold that the Church in her members may possess the whole world; and that
some without living in corrupt Churches, (who err not obstinately) may
possibly be saved. Yet did their Cardinal presume to associate Donatists and
Protestants, that is, to join the Pole-articke and Antarticke together. We see
they, by perverting good meanings, have turned wine into water, and reserved
their worst unto the last.

7 Yet one scruple would be removed, to wit; Whether the Catholic visible
Church may not sometimes be drawn into certain parts of the world, but must
necessarily possess always all the coasts thereof. Their Jesuit Coster
says, We may think that Non enim ex co dicitur Ecclesia Catholica, quod eodem
tempore totius orbis ditiones occupet; hoc quippe ne in hu^c vsque diem
fortassis contingit, quando Antarcticis hominibus, and qui extremas
remotissimasque Americae oras incolunt, sides Christi nunqua^ innotuit: sed his
potissimum duabus de causis, tum quia nulli nationi, vt olim lex Moysi Iudaeis,
sit alligata, nulloque loco conclusa, sicut Donatistarum and Lutheranoru^
errores; quorum hi extra Germania^ nu^qua^ cele brantur, nec illi extra Africa^
reperiebantur. Coster. Ies. Euchir. Tract. de. Eccles. c. 2. p. 89
per adventure the Church was never so universal as to possess all the
quarters of the earth at one time, unto this day. Which he might have said
without all peradventure. As for the present, where will the Romanists find in
all the East any constituted visible Church, which they will esteem
Catholic? He that walked among the seven golden Reu. 1. 13.
Candlesticks, can remove the Churches at his good pleasure. Wherefore the
Cardinal his consequence makes no more against Protestants in the North, than
it does against the Romanists, in the West, or rather much less, as (for of
the The Luciferians (Hieron. Tom. 2. Dial. cont. Lucifer. post med.) are thus
noted: Et vbi, quae^o, sunt isti nimiu^ religiosiamo nimiu^ propham, qui plures
Synagog as asserunt esse, quam Ecclesias? quomodo destructae sunt Diaboli
ciustates: and in fine, hoc est, in teculo^u^ consummatione, ^^lola corruerunt?
Si Ecclesia non habet Christus, aut si in Sardinia tantum habet, nimium pauper
factus est. Their Sardinia, and the Donatists Africa man match together, who
both contradicted the Scriptures, which were fulfilled in the calling of the
whole world unto the faith, and by esta^^^shing Churches unto the faith in
every part of the earth, which Protestants do teach and believe. But that which
the Protestants say of a few professors, they apply only to the prophesied
time of defection from the faith.
Lucifertans we need not enquire) will be made manifest, showing

That the Romanists are hanckled in one link of the heresy of the foresaid
Donatists.
SECT. 5.
8 Although our Adversaries will have the Catholic Church herein distinguished
from the Jewish Synagogue, because the law was particularly tred unto the
Jews, and unto one place: and also from the Donatists, who acknowledged no
Church but in one place: yet as the Donatists held Afric so privileged, that
the Church should always continue there; so do our Adversaries challenge a
prerogative for Rome, that See hereafter about the latter end.
the Pope of Rome cannot err in faith; that the Sea above: which, as the
Donatists, they found upon allegorical expositions of Scripture.
Church of Rome is the Catholic Church, m^ntioning it sometime in their Creed:
that the Sea above: which, worse then Donatists, they maintain without all
care of Scripture.
city of Rome is the Apostolical seat, which cannot be translated. In which
respect there is more accordance of Donatists with the Romanists, than with any
other sect at this day. Notwithstanding in the most opposite order amongst our
adversaries, there is one found to yield consent unto Arethas, Ambrose, and
other Authors, who taught, that I^lud etiam dicendum videtur cum Aretha,
Primasio, Ambrosio, Ausberto Haymon^, and alijs hoc loco, idololatriam, eius
vrbis s^gnificari, defecturamque esse Romam a fide, atque adeo futuram
habitationem Daemoniorum, and omnis spiritus immundi, and volucris immundae ob
execranda flagitia, idololatriaeque superstitionem, quae tunc temporis in
Romana ciuitate, Romanoque Imperio late grassabitur. Viega Ies. in Apoc. 17.
com. 1. Sect. 4. page 772.
the city of Rome shall depart from the faith, and become an inhabitation of
devils, and of every unclean spirit, because of the horrible wickedness and
idolatry, which shall be therein. Thus as the Donatists, in zeal unto
Martyrdom, did kill themselves: so our Adversaries, in their greediness to
accuse others of Donatisme, are become apparently obnoxious in the same guilt.

to adore and magnify therein the power of truth.

CHAP. XVI. An answer unto other Romish Accusations, which are commonly cast
upon Protestants, by other their Romish Adversaries.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY. (To omit sundry other.)
THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
AS though there were yet sundry other heresies defended by Protestants, which
the Apologizers thought good to omit. We cannot be persuaded that they do this
in favor of Protestants; for how will they surcease to press and sting them
with sundry other true Accusations (if they had any such) whom they have
already so greatly iniuried with so sundry false ones? or that they omit them
in their desire to See above often
avoid tediousness, who by multiplicitie of repetitions have been, and still
continue to be so superstitiously superfluous? We rather attribute it unto
their art of Rhetoric, whereby they will seem to pass over other the like
errors, as evidently proved by others; which they themselves do therefore omit,
because they cannot prove them.

2 Therefore have we recalled this their Parenthesis (to omit etc.) back
again, because it engenders a black suspicion of sundry other heresies,
which they might have alleged from their Cardinal Bellarmine, of whom they
borrowed almost all their former exceptions, which they have not spared to
relate at large. Now it will please the Apologists to stand aside a little, and
to give place unto their fellows, and suffer them to prosecute such their
other Accusations, which they themselves have so artificially omitted.

The first Accusation in the question of sola fides, from the example of three
kinds of ancient Heretics, Simonians, Eunomians, and a namelesse third, more
ancient than them both.
THE ROMISH ACCVSERS.
First, Simoniani docebant, saluari homines secundum gratia^ Simonis; quem Deum
faciebant: and non secundum operas iustas, inquit Irenaeus lib. 1. cap. 20.
The Simonian Heretics thought that they might be saved by the grace of Simon
Magus, without exercising of any good works. Secondly, Eunomiani similiter
docebant non posse homini vlla peccata nocere, modo fidem habeat, vt Augustinus
testatur, lib. de haeres. c. 54. At haec eadem est sententia omnium Sectariorum
huius temporis, dum dicunt opera bona esse necessaria, tanquam effectus fidei,
tamen adhuc haerent in codem errore: nam etiam posit^ ista necessitate, docent
opera non mereri vllo modo vitam aeternam, etiamsi Deus earequirat, tanquam
testimonia fidei. Haec autem erat impijssima haeresis Simonis, qui dicebat
hominem saluari per gratiam, non per operas iustas. Bellar. l. 4. de not is
Eccles. c. 9. Simoniani. Annon hic reuiuiscere videtur in Luthero Simonis
haeresis? Hae^ Lindanus. Prateolus Elench. Haeres. Tit. Simoniani.
The Eunomians likewise taught that no sins can hurt a man, if he have faith:
which is the doctrine of Luther, and of all the sectaries of these days.
Thirdly, Augustinus etiam lib. de fide and operib. c. 14. dicit, hanc haeres^n
de sola fide sufficient ad salutem, sine operibus, ortam esse tempore
Apostolorum, ex non intellecto Paulo: and propterea co^^ra h^nc haeresin stylum
praecipue direxitle alios Apostolos in suis Epistolis, id est, Petrum,
Iohannem, Iacobum, and Iudam. Bellar. ibid. Haec enim certe ps^ss^ ma est
Lutheranae doctrinae sententia, ad salutem and iustificationem nihil facere
bona opera quaecunque, solam sidem ^ufficere. Sta^leton lib. 8. de Iustific. c.
1. page 244. and Feu-ardentius comment. in Iac. 2. page 254. The Rhemish
Translators in their last ^diti^n, page 379.
This heresy of the suff^cie^cy of faith unto salvation, without works, was
likewise broached in the days of the Apostles: and is the same with the
doctrine of the Protestants.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the testimonies of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
3 Leave the affinity of words, and examine the matter, and then will
Protestants be discharged from the maine guilt of the Simonians and Eunomians,
by the testimony of their great and vehement Adversary, D. Stapleton, through
a double difference, both in the acception of the word, faith, and the adiunct,
only. For Fidei nomine doctrinam fidei Funomius intellexit: Lutherus vero
specialem fidem, seu fiduciam, vt postca explicabitur. Deinde quia opera in
vniuersum reiecisse videtur: Lutherus vero non vult fidem suam esse ociosam,
sed hominem Christianum, etsi omnibus legibus solutum, tamen libere omnia
facere, and omnibus esse subiectum. Affinis quoque huic Luther anae doctrinae
erat illa vetustiss. Simonis Magi haeresis, qui suos docuit, nec Prophetas
attendere, nec legis minas pertimescere, sed tanquam liberos facere quae
voluerunt; non enim per bonas actiones, sed per gratiam cos salutem
consequtituros, vt con mem. Theodor. hae^ct. fab. lib. 1. -- Quanquam sane and
in hac haeresi duplex illa differentia supradicta locum fortassis habere
potest. Stapleton. de Justice. lib. 8. c. 1. sub initium. Fuit haec olim
haeresis antiqua Eunomij, vt refert August. lib de haeres. c. 59. qu^muis
aliquanto diuersa: affirmauit enim sidem sufficere ad salutem, quamuis mala
opera adessent. At nostri tempotis haeretici sufficere sidem ad salutem
asserunt, negant tamen sine bonis operibus esse posse. Tolet. Ies. and Card.
comm. in Job. 15. annot. 6. page 150.
the faith (says he) which those heretics taught, was the doctrine of faith:
but the faith held by Luther, is a special confidence, namely in Gods mercies
through Christ. Secondly, the heretics maintained that says to be sufficient
to salvation, which rejected all care of good works: but our heretics (says
he, meaning Protestants) teach such a faith, which they say, cannot be alone,
or void of good works.

4 The difference thus stands, that the heretics understood by faith, only
the doctrine of faith, to know it; but the Protestants preach a faith, which is
a full affiance in the mercy of God, through Christ Jesus, unto every
faithful repentant; which difference is as much, as the knowing of Physic,
and applying it. Secondly, the heretics broached a says, which contemns all
good works; and the Protestants profess a says, which cannot but embrace good
works. We may add, the faith of the Simonians depended upon the Confessed by
Bellarm. above in the Accusation, letter. a.

a God; ind the Protestants faith is interested only in Christ, the eternal
son of God. Therefore the distance between the objected heretics and

Magitian, and Christ, the mighty God and Savior of the world. How then can
this be held for Christian dealing in the Romanists, thus odiously to vpbraid
Protestants with the heresy of the Simonians? Now follows

An answer unto the next point: by the testimonies of learned Romanists.
SECT. 3.
5 Concerning the opinion of the Eunomians and other heretics (who lived in
the days of the Apostles) the Apostle S. Paul has remembered their faith and
presumption of grace by this their graceless position, Romans 6. 1.
Let us continue in sin, that grace may abound: this is a poysonfull faith,
which conceiueth a purpose of continuance in sin. Thrice damned be the
Protestants, if they teach such a faith; yea or if they do not utterly condemn
it: and excusable be their accusers, if they prove their accusation; yea and if
they do not also disprove it, who acknowledge concerning Protestants, that they
profess only such a justifying faith, Denique omnes ad vnum Protestants
docent, fidem, quae iustificat, esse viuam and operantem fidem per charitatem,
aliaque bona opera: non some mamus, (ait Caluinus) sidem bonis operibus vacuam,

ardeat, non est ignis: ita fidem rem esse viuam, actuosam, efficacem, quae

It justifies alone, yet is it no more alone, than the heat of the Sun,
which alone warmeth the earth, is severed from light: or that Caluinus l. 3.
Inst. c. 2.. 9. comparat fidem and charitatem cum Christo, and Spiritu sancto:
nam quomodo fieri nequit vt Christus separetur a Spiritu sancto, ita fieri non
posse dicit, vt fides separetur a dilectione, quoniam fides intuetur and
recipit Christum, sed cum spiritu iustificationis and dilectionis. Idem ibid..
Calumus.
Christ is disioyned from his spirit: or than Lutherus ait se scire, fidem sine
spe and dilectione non existere, nec vnquam esse solam: and vult fidem solam
tanquam manum admoueri ad promissiones accipiendas. Sanderus de Iustif. lib 4.
cap. 4. page 469.
an hand (when alone it apprehends any thing) is separated from the body; so
faith the only faculty of the soul, taking hold of the promise of God in
Christ, cannot be divorced from love. They Haec and similia testimonia
mani^este significant, requiri aliquid in nobis vt iustificemur: neque
Aduersarij hoc negare possunt, qui tametsi dicant remissionem non pendere a
condition operum, neque poenitentiam, aut fidem, aut vllum actum nostrum esse
causam aut meritum iustificationis; tamen non negant requiri sidem and
poenitentiam, and fidem viuam, and poenitentiam seriam, and sine his neminem
iustificari. Bellar. l. 3. de Iustif. c. 6.. Haec.
require (as is further confessed) a living faith, and a serious repentance,
without which no man can be justified. So that the Romish accusers, in
oppugning the professed faith of Protestants, appear to have been both false
and faithless.

6 Nevertheless it suffices us not to know that the Protestants doctrine of
faith is no heresy, except we find it also a tried and a saving truth, yea and
the destinate shield of man's soul in his greatest conflict with Satan: This

Romanists have confirmed unto us, which (among other) Albertus Pighius (their
select champion for dispute against Protestants) defends as precisely and

Pope Paulus the third.

7 Yet understand (good Reader) that as a ring of gold, wherein there is
enclosed a precious stone of some singular virtue to cure thy disease, thou
use to say the ring does cure thy grief, yet not of it own virtue, although
it be of gold, but by the power of the precious stone, which it conteines: so
say we that faith justifies, but not by any merit, or worthiness in it self,
although it be the gift of God, and a virtue theological; but by the power and
virtue of Christ his precious merit of redemption, the object which it claspeth
and apprehends. f Controuersiaru^ praecipuarum in Comitijs Ratisbonensibus

of sin: the one from the Florini.

The heresy of the Florini was to make God the cause of sin: the which is
the doctrine of Protestants, in teaching that God did not only permit sin.

Origin taught that man lost the image of God, wherein he was created, which
heresy Calvin taught, saying, that the image of God was blotted out of man by
sin.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the testimonies of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
SAint Augustine has set down the express heresy of the Florini dicebant
Deum creasse mala; contra quod scriptum est, fecit Deus omnia, and ecce valde
bona. Aug. de hares Tom. 6 hares. 66.
Florini; who said (says he) that God created evil, contrary unto Scripture,
where it is written, God saw all that he had made, and behold all was very
good. Did ever any Protestant deliver such a blasphemy, so much as in a dream?

2 Master Calvin, who is most impugned in this point, teaches his Reader to
avoid the iniquity of those men, Iacobus peccatorum authorem merito Deum esse
negat; admonitio necessaria, ne nos Deum loco nostro substituamus, acsi nos.
ipse ad peccandum impelleret. Summa est, frustra tergiuersari homines, qui
vitiorum suorum culpam reijciunt in Deu^, quia non ex alio font proueniunt
mala, quam ex mala cuinsque cordis concupiscentia Caluinus comm. in Iac. 1.
Deus tentat neminem, Iac. 1. Loq^itur de internis tentationibus, quae nihil
aliud sunt, quam inordinati appetitus: illorum authorem merito Deum esse negat,
quoniam ex carnis nostrae corruptione manant. Idem com. in Iac. 1. 13.
who make God the cause of their sins, seeing that (as S. James teaches)
there is no other fountain of sin in man, except the evil concupiscence of
his own heart. As for Obdurare corda multi ad permissionem reijciunt. Caluinus
loco citato.
his opinion of induration of the heart of the ungodly, by a more than
permission of God, through his just power and providence, it See above lib. 3.
cap. 6.
has been justified from the judgment of S. Augustine, by the testimonies of
their own Jesuits Pererius and Suarez. Neither was his doctrine of eternal
decree such as can justly prejudice Gods justice, the conclusion whereof is
this: Sed nos, qui nouimus cunctos homines tot nominibus Dei tribunali
obnoxios, vt de mill interrogati, ne in vno quidem satisfacere possint,
confitemur nihil pati reprobos, quod non iustissimo Dei iudicio conueniat.
Caluinus Instit. l. 3. c. 24.. 14.
We confess that the reprobates suffer nothing, which is not agreeable and
consonant unto the most just judgment of God. Which might be manifested, if
that this Section would admit any large dispute. It will be sufficient for our
present discharge to know that these most fierce and opposite Accusers could
not produce any one Protestant, who did not abhor to impute the cause of
sin unto God: unto whose judgment we refer this their accusation, and the
authors thereof. Now we adioyne

An answer unto the third Accusation: justifying Origin, by the testimonies of
the Romanists.
SECT. 2.
3 The saying of Origin is not altogether so heretical, but that their own
Alphonsus can reconcile it with a Catholic truth: for Imprimis illud mihi
dubiu^ est. an Origenes senserit homine^ per peceatum aliquid de sua substantia
perdidisse, an solum qualitates animae aliquas, vel vt sub al^is verbis dicam,
an imaginem perdiderit, an solam similitudiuem. Nam Victorinus Afer -- ait:
Aliud igitur est juxta imaginem esse, quod quidem substantia est; aliud autem
iuxta similitudinem esse, quod non est substantia, sed in substantia nomen
qualitatis declaratiuu^. Alphonsus de Castro cont. haeres lib. 2. Tit. Adam.
page 43. Si ergo Origenes dicat, Adam post peccatum perdidisse Dei imaginem,
accepto imaginis nomine iuxta ^am, quam praediximus significationem, vt imago
in natura consistat: manifestus est error, iusteque eum ob hanc causam accusat
^piphanius. Ibidem. Quodsi fort ita Origenes cepit Imaginis nomen, vt imaginem
pro similitudine vsurpauerit, quis non videt ibi nullam esse haeresis
suspicionem? Idem quo supra, page 45.
Image (says he) may be taken either for an essential property, or for some
quality. In the first acception of the word Image, the doctrine of Origin is
manifestly erroneous; in the second sense it is free from suspicion of heresy.
So that Origin might possibly have had an orthodoxall meaning; which their
Jesuit Vasquez does resolve more directly, who (lest that S. Augustine might
incur the same condemnation with Origin) does acquit them both, by
distinguishing of the Image of God in man; Verum quia ex hoc loco Augustini
videtur saltem colligi, aliquid illius imaginis amissum fuisse, respondeo
similitudinem and imaginem Dei aliam esse naturaliter impressam in intellectu,
nempe memoriam and voluntatem, and huius nihil minui intrinsece, sed tantum
extrinsece, and ideo nunquam omnino deleri, quantumuis extrinsece minuatur:
aliam vero esse similitudinem and imaginem Dei, homini per gratiam and
caritatem expressam: his enim qualitatibus similes Deo efficimur, quia iusti
etiam apud ipsum constituimu^; and haec omnino amittitur per peccatum, and de
hac intelligendi sunt Origenes and Augustinus lib. illo 6. Vasquez Ies. Tom. 1.
in Thom. disp. 137. cap. 4. page 897. number. 14.
which may signify (says he) either the natural impression, which God made
in the intellectual part of man, as namely his will and memory, which cannot
be altogether extinguished: or else some spiritual quality of grace, as love
and justice, whereby man has a likeness of God; which mage of God, man
utterly lost by his sin: according to the which sense (says he) we are to
expound S. Augustine and Origin.

4 Besides this witness, their Jesuit Maldonate has observed Et ibi
dissipauit substantiam suam viuendo luxuriose.) Neque hic quae rendum esse
puto, quae sit illa substantia, quam iste adolescens intemperanter viuendo
dissipauit: est enim descriptio, vt saepe diximus, maxim perditi, and nepotis
adolescentis; qui nihil aliud quam hominem significat maxinie peccatorem*
Solent plerique substantiam, quam dissipauit, liberum arbitrium, caeterasque
naturales sacultates interpretari. Sic August. Beda, and Euthym. and Bernardus
in sermon* de diverse. astect. animae. Quod e^si ^ano ab illis sensu dictum est,
nolim equidem dicere, ne quis existimet per peccatum perire liberum arbitrium,
quod noui dicunt haeretici.
Augustine, Bid, Euthymius, and Bernard, to say, that Man by sin lost his
free will, and his natural faculties; which speeches, he grants, might be
spoken of them with a sound judgment. And unto the wasting of the Image of
God, he answers, that Alij per eam substantiae partem, quam accepit quamque
dissipauit imaginem ac similitudinem Dei signari putant, Ambros. in comment. --
Quodsi imaginem Dei non naturam ipsam, sed morum conformationem appellant,
quemadmodum multi veteres Authors, and D. Paulus appellare solet. etc. 1. Cor.
15. Maldonat. Ies. com. in Luc. 15. 13. page 296.
if by Image be not meant nature it self, but the Man's conformity unto
godliness, as many ancient Authors (amongst whom he names S. Ambrose)
understood it, it may be allowed. Now follows

A justification of Calvin: by the testimonies of our Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
5 After this their so exact discussing of the sentences of so many, and so
ancient Fathers by our learned Adversaries, they may vouchsafe M. Calvin
audience, who is the only party whom they have cited by name. His answer will
not be long: Postqu^m ergo in co obliterata fuit coelestis imago, no^ solus
sustinuit hanc poenam, vt in locum sapientiae, virtutis, sanctitatis,
veritatis, iustitiae, (quibus ornamentis vestitus fuerat) teterrimae
succederent pestes, caecitas, impote^tia, impuritas, vanitas, iniustitia.
Calvin. Inst. l 2. c. 1.. ^.
The heavenly Image of God (says he) was quite blotted out, when in the place
of wisdom, virtue, truth, justice, and such like ornaments, there succeeded
blindness, impotencie, injustice, vanity. Thus then we see that by Image of
God, he understands only virtuous qualities, whilst he says, that the
Image of God is blotted out: but elsewhere taking the Image of God for the
natural and essential properties, Vno ergo verbo poenitentiam interpretor
regenerationem, cuius non est alius scopus, nisi vt imago Dei, quae per Adae
transgressionem foedata, and tantum non obliterata fuerat, in nobis reformetur.
Caluini^ Inst. lib. 3. cap. 3.. 9.
The Image of God (says he) was blemished, but not blotted out, or
extinguished.

6 Mark now: Origin spoke doubtfully, and their Jesuits acquit him by
interpreting that by Image he meant not any essential property, but virtuous
qualities. Here Calvin speaks not doubtfully, but expressly, interpreting
himself, that by the Image of God in man, he meant but only virtuous
qualities; and he remains in their censure condemned. But either must Calvin
be justified, or else the ancient Fathers (such as were Augustine, Ambrose,
Bid, Euthymius, Bernard, and other Fathers, together with Alphonsus, Vasques,
Maldonate, the Romish Doctors and moderators of this cause) must together with
Calvin be with him jointly condemned. Happy is Caluins case, who has no
accusers but such as can in their conscience acquit him. Miserable are those
accusers, whose accusation is thus inexcusable.

CHAP. XVIII. The fourth and fifth Accusations: the first in the matter of
Women's Ecclesiastical function: in the example of the Peputian heretics.
THE ROMISH ACCVSERS.
First, Peputiani haeretici, vt a^t August. de haeres. c. 27. tantum dant
mulieribu^ principatum, vt Sacerdotio quoque apud eos honorentur. Lutherus Art.
13. ex ijs quos Leo 10. damnauit, dicit. in Sacramento poenitentiae aeque
absoluere posse mulierem vel puerum, atque Episcopum, vel Papam. Et iam re ipsa
Caluinistis in Anglia mulier quaedam est summus Pontifex, Bellar. lib. 4. de
notis Eccles. c 9.. 4. Peputiani. This latter is also the slander of Sanders,
de clauibus David. lib. 6.
the heretics called Peputians, gave unto women a government, only that they
might be honored in the office of Priestdome: such like is the article of
Luther, who taught that a woman, or boy might absolve as well as a Bishop, or
the Pope himself. And the Caluinists in England are not unlike; among whom
there reigns a woman Pope.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the confessions of their Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
LVther his meaning is rightly conceived by their own Bishop Roffensis, to
wit; when either man or woman shall comfort any penitent soul with the words
of the Gospel, and the contrite party believes, he finds remission of his
sins; At huius assertionis Lutherus sumit ansam, quod ex proxime superiori se
collegisse putat, totam vim delendae culpae non in Ministro, sed in fide
credentis sitam esse: and non potestati Ministrorum, sed fidei (qua in Dei
verbum credimus) remissionis effectum esse tribuendum: quamobrem and iam
adijcit, quod etiamsi mulier aut puer haec verba proferat, peccator haec
audiens, and credens, protinus absolutus est. Roffensis Episc. art. 13. fol.
134.
Not by any power of the man or woman, but by the virtue of the Gospel, which
is the power of God unto salvation; this begets no confusion in the
Ministry: but as when it shall happen in any man's disease, that a woman does
tell what herb she has found to be a sovereign remedy for that disease,
which the party does use with success, she is not thereby made a Physician:
accordingly a faithful devout penitent by the words of grace may receive
comfort, and hope of remission, cuen from the mouth of any Christian, whom
notwithstanding he does not acknowledge to be a professed Minister, or his
official Absoluer.

2 As for that Lady-Queene Elizabeth, and Queen of Ladies, what Priestly
function did she ever exercise? Only she commanded the tribe of Leui to
perform their offices with faithfulness, according to her charge, whereof she
was to give account unto God; for it is Regal. In other duties which are as
merely Ecclesiastical, as is preaching of the Word, or ministering of the
Sacraments, she was as absolutely no Priest, as was her renowned sister Queen
Mary, whom the Romish always honored with the title of Catholic. Happy
therefore is the memory of that our Queen, whom the very malignance of
rancorous slanderers does daily make more glorious. See now

The Accusation returned upon the Romanists.
SECT. 2.
3 These Accusers, who call all women's ministry heretical, who, and from
whence are they, and against who^do they so bitterly inueigh? First, they
contend against Protestants, by whom they themselves are condemned of the same
ancient heresy, from the testimony of Epiphanius and Tertullian, for not only
permitting, but also commanding their Nouam enim baeresin Caluinus excogitauit

Accusers are from Rome, where there was sometime (as is confessed of some
indeed) a Muliet vocata lohannes octauus -- duos annos rexit sedem Apostolicam,

woman Pope, conferring sacred Orders, and ministering the Sacraments. Are not
then these singular Accusers, who object unto others that error, which upon due
examination redoundeth unto their own double shame, both by a misconstruction
of others, and by their own transgression? There follows

A second Accusation, concerning sin in the regenerate; from the heresy of
Proculus, and of the Messalians.
THE ROMISH ACCVSERS.
Proclus haereticus apud Epiphan. haeres. 64. dicebat peccatum in renatis
semper viuere: concupiscentiam enim vere esse peccatum, nec tolli per
Baptismum, sed sopiri per fidem* quod idem ^ostea docuerunt Messaliam haeretici
apud Theod l. 4. de haeret. fab. Haec est ipsissima sententia Lutheri art. 2
and 31. atque in assertiombus corundem articulorum. item Philippi in Loc.
commumb. cap. de Peccato originis, and Calvin. lib. 4. Instit. c. 15.. 10.
Bellar. l. 4. de not is Eccles. cap. 9.. 5. Proclus.
The heretic Proculus or Proclus did say, that sin did live in the
regencrate, and thought concupiscence to be a sin, not taken away by
Baptism, as did the Messaliani. Which is the very doctrine of Luther,
Calvin, and Melancthon.

THE JUSTIFICATION OF PROTESTANTS: By the evidence of the alleged Authors, and
the testimonies of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
4 The question in Epiphanius is not whether concupiscence be a sin, or
absolutely whether it live in the regenerate, but whether it live that life of
(...), that is, of a King: for as long as it does not dominere, it is said to
be mortified, and not to live, as the words of The words of Proculus or Proclus
are these: Peccatum in nobis viuit And again, Ne haberet homo malum immortale
peccatum praedominans. Apud Epiphan. haeres. 64. and M^thodius confuting him,
says:
Proclus, and the answer of Si talis est natura carnis, vt legi Dei subijci
nequeat quomodo Paulus hortatur, Non regnet peccatu^. etc. -- Non paret
scortationi, delicijs; omne enim peccati studium per carnem (intelligit corpus)
consummationem acquirit. -- Lex spiritus vitae per Christum penitus peccatum
regnans in carne vicit. Apud Epiphan. ibid.
Methodius in his confutation do plainly show, arguing thus: If this be the
nature of flesh, that it cannot be subjected unto the spirit, why does the
Apostle thus exhort (...) etc. Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies to
bring forth the lusts thereof; and again, the spirit of life by Christ has
altogether overcome that reigning sin? And we know that the Apostle, who will
not have sin to be a King to Rom 6.
reign, does notwithstanding acknowledge it to remain as a rebel in the
regenerate, Romans 7. 23. a cording to the Rhemists Transt.
(...), that is, rebelling against the law of the mind. Therefore may we think
that the Accuser was but (as S. Hierome speaks) Oculus sine pupilla, when he
read the heresy of Proculus, and mistook the state of the question.

5 Now the heresy being thus, we covet to know first, when sin may be said
to reign, and whether Protestants hold the heretical opinion: in both which
we can desire no better Author to guie us satisfaction, than is their now
professed Accuser. Non regnet peccatum, etc. Rom 6. Nomine peccati, omnium
consen'u, Concupiscentia accipienda est: quae quidem tum metaphorice regna^e,
and imperare dicitur* cum ardentius incitata consensum voluntatis extorouet.

do object (says he) that the Apostle shows concupiscence to be a sin in
the regenerate, but yet that it reigns not in them. Thus are Protestants
delivered from the heresy of Proclus. In the next place we prove,

That Concupiscence is a sin in the regenerate.
SECT. 4.
6 Our Adversaries cannot be offended to hear, that concupiscence does live in
the regenerate: but that which they call heresy, is to affirm, that
concupiscence is a sin in persons regenerate. Which we say, was not the
heresy either of Of Proclus we have heard: now of the Messalians.
Proclus, or of the Dicunt Massiliani, Baptisma nihil iuuare eos, qui ad eos
acce. dunt. Theodan the place objected. But the Protestants have been
acknowledged to con^^sse, that (...) bapti^me grace is conferred: as for the^r
radere peccato, non tollere, if they understood sin, materially, then are our
aduersa^ies no less heretics, who have granted that concupiscence materially
taken, is still a sin in the regenerate: if by sin they meant the guilt, or
obligation of deb^, then are Protestants no Massilianists, who grant that it is
not imputed unto the regenerate.
Messalians. Neither yet is it indeed an heresy either in words or in sense.
1. of the first.

7 When the Apostle said, Romans 6. Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies:
See above, letter. d.
by sin (says their Cardinal Bellarmine) all men understand concupiscence:
and S. Augustine observes, that See ibid at the letter. e.
the Apostle did not exhort them that sin should not be in the^, but that it
should not reign in them. When again the same Apostle says, Heb. 12. Casting
off the sin that compasses us about etc. Deponens circumstans peccatum, Heb.
12. Hoc etiam non praetereundum: Non simpliciter dixit, Peccatum; sed cum
articulo, (...), quia concupi^c^ntiam carnis aduersus spiritum intelligit, quam
cum articulo appellare peccatum solet, Romans 7, and 8. multis in locis Hoc ergo
nunc dicere arbitror Paulum, quod alijs verbis dixit Romans 6. Non regnet, etc.
Ribera Ies. comment. in Heb. 12. 3 page* 603.
it is to be noted (says their Jesuit Ribera) that by sin the Apostle
understands concupiscence, calling it so with an article, (...), that is, The
sin, a note of singularity. The words then are not heretical, but
Apostolical. We come to the sense.

8 Sin is taken either materially, or formally; the Romanists hold
concupiscence to be sin in the * first meaning, because it is not voluntary:
the Protestants hold the second, because it is still a transgression of a
commandment. Which is thus proved, first by reason: Fatemur concupiscentiam
esse quandam iniquitatem, and obliquitatem, non solum contra dominatum nientis,
sed etiam contra legem Dei. Stapleton. l. 3. de Iustificat. cap. 2.
We confess (says M. Stapleton) that concupiscence is a kind of iniquity and
obliquitie, not only against the donanion of the mind, but also against the
law of God. Well then, the proper definition of sin being this, A
transgression of Gods law, how shall we conceine that it is no sia? Again it
was (they grant) formally a sin in man unregenerate: but why? because of the
commandment, Thou shall not lust: then must it be sin in the regenerate,
because the commandment continues the same. Therefore cannot this Ethiope
(concupiscence) possibly change her color, but must be formally a sin: for
sin even in an unregenerate man may be sometimes vnuoluntarie.

9 Secondly, by authority: when we confer with S. Ita concupiscentia carnis,
aduersus quam bonus concupiscit spiritus, and peccatum est, quia inest illi
inobedi^ntia contra dominatum mentis, and quia reddita est meritis
inobedientis, and causa and poena peccati est, defectione consentientis, vcl
contagione nasc^ntis. August. contra Julian. Pelag. l. 5. c. 3. col. 1066
Augustine, he calls it sin, because it rebelleth against the dominion of
the mind. And we have among our Adversaries their Cardinal Caietane, calling
it Haec enim pars appellatur peccatum multiplici ratione, tum causaliter, vel
quia est causa peccati, vel quia est effectus peccati primi parentis: tum
formaliter pro quanto est pars peccati originalis. Caietan. com. in Romans 7.
page 40.
formally a sin. And (not to stand upon the first motions of concupiscence,
which their Viues notes to be called but Tam penitissime visccribus nostris
haeret veneteae rei cupiditas, tam ingenitus est a natura nobis ille appetitus,
quem subtilissime magna illa artifex omnium antium pectorious indidit, quo vel

iov venial) their Quae ab Apostolo, and eum sequuto Augustino, pecatum
nonnunquam appellatur, non modo quia peccato facta est, sed quod somes sit and
incentiuum peccati, and dominationi mentis resistit. Si igitur peccati rationem
in vitio illo, and iniquitate, languore, infirmitate, ac morbo constituas, cui
spiritu resistendum sit, ne actus illicitus gignat, non inepte peccatum
dicitur: certe insign^s quidam Theologus aperte asserit, etiam in regeneratis
manner peccatum, tametsi non imputetur. Si^ peccati rationem in ipsa offensa
Dei, and reatu, cui ex aduerso poena and damnatio respondet, sitam intelligas,
certum est in regeneratis non esse peccatum, vtpote, in quibus facta est
remissio peccatorum, and reatus omnis solutus. Cassander Consult. art. 2 Tit.
De concup^^c. page 4.
Cassander does endeavor to determine this point: who considering concupiscence
as it is contradictorie unto the spirit of the mind, thinks, that with S.
Augustine, we may call it a sin: but if we consider it in respect of the
offense of God, and guilt which is subject unto damnation, then (says he) is
it not a sin in the regenerate; which determination we do allow but in part.

10 In brief* our conclusion is, that concupiscence, in respect of it own
nature, is a sin: but in respect of the person, (who is a party regenerate,
in whom the guilt is pardoned) it is as no sin. Which Tenet of all
Protestants was held by some of their own notable Divines, saying, Est
communis sententia apud Sectarios (meaning Protestants) concupiscentiam post
iustificatiouem esse vere acproprie peccatum, quamuis credentibus non
imputetur. Bellar. l. 5. de amiss. Great. c. 5. initio.
Concupiscence remains a sin in the regenerate, although not imputed unto
him. Well then, that heresy which Proclus taught, the Protestants hold not,
and that which the Protestants hold is no heresy.

heresies of the Sabellians against the Trinity.

doctrine of Seruetus.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the judgment of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
ONE of the 20. heresies, whereby this Accuser would prove them (whom he names
Calainists and Lutherans) to be heretics, is this wherewith he charge
Seruetus; as though they could suspect Protestants to be guilty of this
heresy, who themselves confess, saying, Cochlaeus in discussione articuli
primi Augustanae confessionis (namely of the Trinity) palam scripserit, De hoc
articulo inter nos and Protestants nulla est controuersia, neque in
confessione, neque in apologia: proinde in eo per oninia consentimus. Test

There is no controversy between us and Protestants in the article of the
Trinity; or that the heresy of Seruetus might be laid to the charge of
Protestants, who (as their adversary the Jesuit Primus hac aetate o^nium

heresy: or that the Romanists could be fit men to make this objection, who (as

THE ROMISH ACCVSERS, in the next heresy of the Manichees: in condemning the
ancient Patriarchs.
Manichaei praetere^ accusabant passim Patres Testam ^ti veteris, vt Abraham,
Sampsonem, Saram, and similes, vt August. testatu^ l. 22 contra Faust. and
duobus libris contra aduersar Legis and Proph. Idem Caluinus dixit, Saram

c. 9.. Manichaei praeterea.
The Manichaeans did accuse the Fathers of the old Testament: and Calvin said,
that Abraham had been an idolater, and Rebecca guilefull, and the like.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the testimonies of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 Senensis an Author of venerable esteem among the Romanists, relates and
refuteth the heresy of the Manichees out of S. Augustine, thus: Paulus
quampl^^a veteris Instrument^ di^ta factaque, ^^ praesc^tim illas histori^s,
quas Man^chaei derident, authoritate sua confirmauit. Quanquam vero
Patriarcharum (answering to the objection of the Manichees) in v^teri

page 621 and 625. out of S. Augustine.
The Manichees deriding the Scriptures of the old Testament, did therefore
contumeliously inueigh against the lives of the Patriarchs: but although we
grant (says he) that the Patriarchs were grievous offenders in their lives,
yet is this so far from disabling the history, that it does rather confirm
the truth thereof; because it does not conceal either what was reprehensible
in good men, or what was commendable in the wicked. But Calvin does not scorn
the Scriptures of the old Testament, with the Manichees, but professedly

crudelitatis and nimij rigoris accusabant. etc Where he condemns them and the

abhors the Manichees for their contempt of Scriptures.

3 True it is that Calvin noted the vices of the old Patriarchs, and his
censure is also true, whether in the general, or in the particular: for first
in general, S. Augustine makes this a matter of the commendation of holy
Scripture, August. c^ntra Faust. l. 22. c. 65.
Quaedam in laudabilibus vituperanda non tacens, that is, because it reuealeth
the saults of good men. Which consequence of the sincerity of Scripture, their

Pererius enforces against the Manichees, from the related drunkenness of
Noah. And S. Ambrose, making as it were triacle of the sins of the Patriarchs
and other holy men, applies them unto double use (as their own Patriarcharu^

second is unto sinners, for their speedy and serious conversion.

4 But his particular exceptions are they which offend their Cardinal, who is
especially zealous for to defend the reputation of Abraham, whom (whilst he
lived in Vr) God called out of Chaldaea, and therefore Abraham seemed unto
Calvin, before his call, to have been an idolater. This is the principal
matter which their Cardinal Bellarmine urges, to convince Calvin of a
blasphemons heresy. But alas the blindness of malignitie! for their own
learned Chronologer Fuisse quidem Abrahamum aliquando superstitionis
idololatriae infectum, docet Genebrard ex sententia duoru^ nobiliss Rabbinorum.
-- In hanc sertentiam videtur propeasior fuisse Andreas Mazius, qui aetate

Genebrard maintained the very samepoint, directed by the judgment of two
excellent Rabbis or Doctors among the I^wes; whose opinion is seconded by
Masius (whom their Jesuit has commended for his Catholic writings,)
confirmed by the judgment of Philo and of their Abrahae vocatio and institutio

CHAP. XX. Of the eight and ninth Romish Accusations.
THE ROMISH ACCVSERS, In the first.
Ariani docebant, filium Dei esse Patre minorem, vt est apud Epiphan. hae^. 69.
-- Eundem errorem aperte docent hoc tempore multi, qui Trithei^ae (...). 10.
Ariani.
The Arians taught, that the Son is inferior unto the Father: so do the
Tritheits at this day.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the testimony of their Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
SO do the Tritheits: true; but what is that unto Protestants, as unto Luther,
Calvin, and Melancthon, Quos nouo^ Arianos (meaning the Tritheits) Lutherus,
Caluinus, Philippus, and similes vt haereticos impugnarunt. Bellarm. ibid..
Primum errore^
who (as witnesses their Adversary) impugned those Tritheits? Therefore might
the accuser have kept the Tritheits out of his Catalogue of heresies, framed by
him purposely against Protestants, seeing that the Tritheits were no more
Protestants, than the Romanists are Tritheits. Is it not so?

THE ROMISH ACCVSERS.
Caluinus dicit Patrem esse Deu^ per excellentia^ quandam. Bellar. Praef. in
controu, de Christ^.. Sed iam.
Calvin said, that the Father is God by a kind of excellency: Iure Caluinum
ponimus in eorum haereticorum numero, qui Filij diuinitatem inficiati sunt:
etenim sensit Caluinus nomen Dei (...). i. per excellentiam soli Patri tribui.
Valent. Ies. lib. 1. d^ unit. and Trinit. c 9. initio.
Therefore do we justly reckon Calvin among those heretics, who denied the
Divinity of Christ: Site sane Bozius: Aufers, Calvin, inquit, aequalitatem
Filio cum Patre, respectu naturae, personae, voluntatis, generationis, etiam
nominis. Armandus Ies. Epist. ad Chamierum, part altera, page 11.
Certainly this Calvin taught: Est hi^ Caluini Atheismus. Posseuinus Ies. de
notis diuini verbi, l. 3. page 78.
Which is his Atheism.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: According to the judgment of their Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 Thus have Bellarmine, Valentia, Armandus, Posseuinus, four Jesuits,
charged Calvin with blasphemy; and can he possibly escape? At si Pater est per
excellentia^ Deus, quomodo non est mayor Filio? Bellar. quo supra.
For if the Father be by excellency God, how is he greater than the Son? This
is the maine and only objection, which his accuser does enforce: this once
assoyled, Calvin must be immediately absolved. Well then, let us first hear of
their Cardinal Tolet, who has something to this purpose: Ioh. 14. Pater mayor
me est.] Aliqui ration^ diuinitatis haec dicta esse censent, vt nomen [maioris]
non substantiae inaequalitatem, -- sed originem dicat, quia ab ipso filius est,
non a filio Pater. Hanc expositionem illustres Doctores sequuntur, inter quos
Athanas. orat. 2. contra Arian. Basil. lib. 4. contra Eunom. Greg. Nazianz.
orat. 4. contra Arianos, Hilar l. 9. de Trinit. Orig. him. 2. in diuersos.
Tolet. Ies. com. in Ioh. 14. 28. Pater est mayor Flio, etiam quatenus Filius
Deus erat, non quidem reipsa, sed hoc ipso quod ille Pater. hic Filius erat;
Patri^ enim nomen honori^icentius est nomine Filij, quia principium and, vt
Graeci loquntur, causam Filij significat. Sic exponunt Athanasius, Hilarious,
Epiphaniu^, Greg. Nazianzenus, Cyrillus, Leontius, Chrysostomus, Theophylactus,
Euthymius. Maldenat. Ies. com. in Ioh. 14. 28.
Some (says he) by occasion of that saying of Christ, [Iohn. 14. My Father is
greater then I] thought that these words were spoken by Christ in respect of
his Divinity: So that by the word [greater] be not understood the inequality
of the substantial essence of his Divinity, but his original begetting:
only in this respect the Son is from the Father, and the Father is not from
the Son. Which exposition has been followed by famous Doctors, as namely,
Athanasius, Basil, Gregory Nazianzene, Hilary, Origin, Epiphanius, Cyrill,
Leontius, Theophylact, Euthymius. In the which respect other Fathers are
observed by their Bishop Bouius, to have Constit Clementis cap. 17. Pater super
omnia Deus. -- Quod sic Patrem appellauerit, authoritas principij, sieve (vt
antiqui Patres loquuntur) excellentia causae effecit, vt prisci illi omnem
eminentiam soli Deo Patri tribuerint: non quod illa verbo and spiritui
detrahere voluerint (long enim abest talis ab little pietate sententia) sed
quia hanc authoritatis praestantiam Patri, qui est fons and origo diuinitatis,
tribuendam censueiunt. Quod nonnullis testimonijs confirmabo, Ignatij epist. ad

(the pretended Pope of Rome) and also Ignatius.

3 So that sentence of the heretics called the Tritheits, and of the Fathers
being the same, in words, viz. The Father is by an excellency God; but
contradictorie in sense: Calvin must necessarily be acknowledged to have
followed the interpretation of the orthodoxall Fathers, who have been confessed
by the Accuser himself to have Sea above. 1. letter, b.
impugned those heretics, whom he calls the Tritheits. What greater dignity
could our Adversaries have done unto the memory of Calvin, than by thus
sending four Jesuits to accuse his speech of excellency of the Father: and by
and by to bring in twelve Fathers to acquit him, among whom, if they will, they
may make Pope Clement the chief of that inquest?

SECT. 3.
4 We answer, first that the Accuser should have showed that S. Augustine
censured the Arian heretics for depending altogether upon Scripture: but he
could not, for S. Augustine in his conflict with the same Maximinus, does
challenge him to leave the contention about Councels, and to admit of the
decision of the whole cause of Arianisme by Nec ego Nicenum, nec tu debes
Ariminense, etc. -- Scripturarum authoritatibus non quorumcunque proprijs, sed
vtriusque communibus testibus res cum r^, causa cum causa, ratio cum ratione

Scriptures. Secondly, the Arians relied not wholly upon Scriptures, but sought
defense of their doctrine from the Confessed above lib. 2. cap. 25. lit. i.
books of Origin, and Hermes. Lastly, the Secundo dissidemus, quod illi
existimant Apostolos quidem quaedam instituisse praeter Scripturam, quae ad

praecepta, sed libera: nihil autem tradidisse praeter Scripturam ad sidem aut

Accuser confesses that Protestants do not utterly reject all Traditions.
Therefore all this while has the Accuser roued wide at three marks, the
Arians, S. Augustine, and the Protestants. Of this article of Traditions we
have entreated sufficiently See above lib. 2. cap. 25.

which is the error of Bucer, and Molinaeus, in saying, that by bearing of
Christ, aperuit vuluam. Inter alias innumerabiles Caluinistarum haereses, haec

Caluinists are herein heretics.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the testimonies of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
GAbriel Prateolus a Parisian Divine, in his book professedly written for the
discovery of ancient heresies, interprets the meaning of S. Augustine, in
censuring Iouinia^ to have taught, that Diuus quoque Augustinus lib. de haeres.
illi impingit, quod dixerit B. Dei genitrice^ fuisse a viro suo Joseph
carnaliter cognitam post Christum natu^: quod tamen illi non ascribit B.
Hieronymus, qui contra eum duo^ libros co^posuit. Prateolus de sect. and dogm.
here is. lib. 9. De Iouinianis. number 6. page 241. So that the pariendo corruptam,
used by S. Augustine, he interprets of a pariendo, which supposes cognoscere
virum, per coitum virilem: which indeed only does corrupt virginity. This was
the error of Heluidius; whether of Iouinian, or no, Prateolus seems to doubt,
because Hierome writing two books against Iouinian, would not have passed such
a blot as this.
the blessed Virgin after the birth of Christ was known of Joseph. The
accusation then lies thus: Protestants for saying that the blessed Virgin
bare Christ our Savior, after the manner of women, aperiendo vuluam, do
therefore teach that the blessed Virgin after the birth of Christ, did know
her husband Joseph after the manner of a wife, and bare other children; which
was the heresy (say they) of Iouinian, doubtless of August. Tom. 6. haeres.
84. From this heresy their Coccius freeth Luther with a non probat, etc. and
charge no Protestant with it. Coccius Thesaur. Tom. 1. lib. 8. art. 3.
Heluidius. We need not exemplify the cruditie of this kind of Logic.

2 Yet are they loath that Protestants should thus escape, whom they therefore
condemn for saying, that the blessed Virgin did in bearing Christ vuluam
aperire, which the Romanists will have all one with virginitatem corrumpere;
and therefore with a loud shoot cry out upon Protestants as upon cursed
heretics: notwithstanding that Protestants were directed in the phrase by the
holy Ghost: Luc. 2. 23. according to the Rhemish translation.
They carried him unto Jerusalem to present him unto the Lord, as it is written
in the law, Every male opening the matrice, shall be called holy unto the Lord.
Whereupon it is that diverse Fathers, to wit, Theophylact, Ambrose, and Origin,
did not doubt to say, that Alij, contra hanc legem proprie ad Christum
pertinuisse asserunt, eo quod ipse solus aperuit vuluam matris suae, cum alijs
aperiat vir vterum, quae est sententia Theophylacti super hoc loco: similiter
and Ambrofij si^ scribentis; Non enim vitilis coitus vuluae virginalis secreta
reserauit, sed immaculatum semen inuiolabili vtero spiritus sanctus infudit.
Hic ergo solus aperuit sibi vuluam, nec mirum, qui enim dixerat ad Prophetam,
priusquam te formarem in vtero noui te, and in vulua matris sanctificam te: qui
ergo vuluam sanctificauerat alienam, vt nasceretur Propreta, hic est, qui
aperuit Matris suae vuluam, vt immaculatus exiret. Similia habet and Origenes,
hom. 14. super Luc. Sacratum (inquit) quippiam sonat: quem cunque enim de vtero
effusum marem dixeris, non sic aperit Matris suae vuluam. vt D. Jesus, quia
omnium mulierum non partus infantis, sed coitus viri vuluam reserat. I am vt

Euang. cap. 10. page 74. col. 1.
Christ was that immaculate one, who alone (without the preceding act of man)
matris suae vuluam aperuit; as witnesses their own Bishop Iansenius.
Therefore the assertion of Protestants, as yet, appears to be Prophetical
and Evangelical.

3 If now the accusers shall no longer urge the act, but the manner thereof,
which some Protestants have described, to be after the manner of childbirth,
Claustra virginalis vuluae reserare: this manner is indeed denied by some
Fathers, but not by all, nor yet by any as heretical, as though it implied any
proper corruption of virginity. For their elder B. Rhenanus does deliver us
the express testimony of that ancient Tertullia^, saying, Deinde quod dicit
Tertull. Mariam patefacti corporis lege peperisse, cum omnes hodie Theologorum
centuriae Christum clauso Virginis vtero prodijsse velint. -- Sed haec sunt

Mariam patefacti corporis lege peperisse; which was never imputed unto him for
an heresy: insomuch as their forenamed Rhenanus, in reverence of the memory
of this Father, does scorn the new and contrary subtlety of the Romish
School. Therefore have their late Romanists taken order, that the whole
testimony should be Deleantur sequentia in B. Rhenano in arg. libri de carne

4 Wise men they are in their generation, albeit herein less wise in blotting
out old Authors, and yet bolting out new, who in effect shall justify the
former assertion, Claustra virginalis vuluae perfringere, non est virginitatem

foedam delectationem, quorum primum naturae est, alterum poenae, tertium

CHAP. XXII.
THE XI. AND XII. ROMISH ACCVSATIONS: The first concerning Original sin.
Pelagiani docebant non esse in hominibus peccatum originale, and praecipue in
filijs fidelium; ita refert August. lib. 6. contra Julian. cap. 2. and 3. and
lib. 4. ad Bonifac. c. 2. and 4. Hoc diserte docent Bucerus and Calumus. Why?
Solum in filijs fidelium negant peccatum originale, quos dicunt sanctos nasci.
and saluari etiam sine Baptismo. Bellar. l. 4. c. 9. de notis,. 14. Pelagiani.
Pelagianam haeresin Calumus renouat, cum etc. Lindanus Panopl. lib. 4. cap. 15.
The Pelagians said, that there is no original sin in men, especially in the
children of the faithful: which is the doctrine of Bucer and Calvin.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: By the testimonies of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
Cardinal Bellarmine, and Lindane, two of the greatest Panoplists and armorers
that the Church of Rome has had, are both bent against Protestants, to bring
them within the compass of a damnable heresy: but what? Calvin (say they)
teaches, that there is no original sin, especially in the children of the
faithful: so they. But their Gregory de Valentia, a Jesuit, and a public
Reader in their Schools, contrarily affirms, that Lutherus and Caluinus, and
caeteri nouatores adeo non negauerunt peccatum originale, vt magna etiam
contentione illud asserant, and prodigiosis etia^ loquendi formulis, neque
minus falsis ac impijs, illud supra modum exaggerauerint. Greg. Valent. Ies. de
orig. pecc. c. 2. initio.
Luther, Calvin, and other Nouellers (so he calls them) are so far from
the denying of Original sin, that they vehemently and with prodigious manner
of speech do falsely and impiously exaggerate it above measure. Unto him we
adioyne their Jesuit Vasquez, who likewise inueigheth against Calvin and
Luther, for Alter error est aliorum nostri temporis, qui affirmant essentiam
peccati originalis esse concupiscentia^, and fomitem qui nos ad malum inclinat.
-- Ita express tradiderunt Lutherani, -- and Caluinus. Quare in confessione
Augustana hoc peccatum appellarunt maximum. Vasquez Iesan Thom. tom. 1. disp.
132. cap. 1. number. 2.
affirming concupiscence to be a part of Original sin, and the greatest of
sins.

2 Here is a counterpoise of their own witnesses: two of them say, that
Protestants do deny that there is any Original sin in children unbaptized:
two other say, that they affirm, that there is original sin in all, yea in
the parties baptized. Both these kind of witnesses conspire against Protestants
to prove them heretics, as did the Elders to prove Suzanna an adulteress: but
when we (as Daniel teaches) put the witnesses asunder, then is their falsehood
found out by their contrariety, which is more than that of the forenamed
Elders: for these two assertions, Protestants deny original sin, and
Protestants do not deny original sin, but do rather too extremely affirm
it, fall upon that text, Marc. 14. 56.
They bare false witness, and their testimonies agree not.

A further justification of Protestants: by the confession of their Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
3 May not Protestants be absolved by that which has been now confessed? O no,
for either they deny original sin, and so are they no better than Pelagian
heretics; or else they do too much affirm and exaggerate it, and thus are
they false and impious Nouellers. Whether therefore thus, or so, Protestants
must be condemned for a doctrine concerning original sin: be this for an old
or new error it skilleth not, it is decreed they must be condemned.

4 Severe Judges, and precipitate: for the doctrine of Protestants concerning
the nature of original sin has received a better approbation by their own
extreme Adversary. For Ecchius (whom the Romanists have named the Sea the

in their confessions, Apologies and other books, the doctrine of original
sin constantly and Consonantly with us: but those who were condemned in the
Council of Trent, were the Pelagians, and Armenians, and Albanenses, and all
others who denied original sin. Who now sees not the prauitie of these
Accusers? whom it might have become to pass by the Protestants manner of
exaggeration of original sin, in making it the greatest sin; and rather to
have controlled some of their own men for diminution, in making it the Taperus

The Pelagians say, that every sin is mortal, as S. Hierome relates: And
this is the error of all Protestants.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: According to the testimonies of their Romish
Adversaries.
SECT. 3.
5 In the place of S. Hierome, (the only witness brought in to prove the
Pelagians guilty of an heresy, in this article) there appears nothing to
that purpose. S. Augustine, who is called Malleus haereticorum, that is, the
Mallet against heretics, beats the Pelagians unto dust, yet never lays he
any such thing to their charge. Nay their own Romish relators of heresies,

Prateolus, with those whom this later cites, as Lindane, Staphylus and

an old heresy. And that it is also no heresy, but an orthodoxal truth, most of
their own Authors have See above.
already avouched. According to our promise we return unto

The Romish application of the distinction of mortal and venial sins,
confuted.
SECT. 4.
6 Seeing that the Romanists will be called Catholics, in confessing that no
man can live without sin in this life, how shall they brand Protestants with
the name of heretics, for saying that it is impossible to keep the law? The
only answer that their D. Quod autem Augustinus sem per loquatur de solis
venialibus, quoties fine peccato neminem iustorum esse docet, perpetua eius
doctrina ostendit toto fere 2. lib. de pecc. merit. and remiss. and toto lib.

posse legem adimplere, quin venialiter peccet quam saepissime. Stapleton.
doctr. prin. l. 6. de perfect. just. cap. 5.
Stapleton uses, and which he would have us to mark diligently, is, that none
can fulfill the law of God without venial sins. Then say we, they must
confess together with Protestants, an impossibility of an absolute
performance of the law. No, says their Cardinal: Et quia quod non est
perfect voluntarium, hoc ipso etiam non est perfect contra legem, nisi
materialiter: propterea rect^ dicunt* Theologi, peccata veniala, euiuscunque
tandem generis^* sint, non esse contra legem, sed praeter lege^. Quod totum
etian. hac ratione confirmari potest: Si peccatum veniale perfect ac proprie
esset contra legem, sequeretur, hominem iustum, statim atque vnum peccatum
veniale commisit, esse vere ac perfect^ legis praeuaricatorem, and per hoc reum
omnium coelestium praeceptorum, iuxta illud Apostol^ lacobi: Qui offendit in
vno, factus est omniu^reus. Bellar. l. 1. de amiss. great. cap. 11.. Denique.
Because veniniall sins are not perfectly voluntary, therefore are they but
only praeter legem, besides the law, and not formally contra legem, contrary
unto the law. Confessing that if that which they call venial sin, be by
nature properly mortal, then the offending in one venial does make a man
guilty of transgression of the whole law: and consequently does infer an
impossibility of keeping the law.

7 Wherefore it concerns us only to prove that the venial sin is not
praeter, besides, but even contra, contrary unto the law of God: if yet we
need prove that which their own Doctors confess, as namely their Jesuit
Dicendum vero est, vt docuerunt Durandus, Caietanus, Vega; Veniale peccatum
esse quidem contra legem. Azor. Ies. Instit. Moral. part. 1. l. 4. c. 8..
Dicendum.
Azorius, guarded with the consent of Durand, Caietane, and Vega, he might have
ad^ed D. Stapleton) who teach, that we must say, that the venial is contrary
unto Gods law. Which opinion Distinguunt and alij peccata venialia a
mortalibus, quod haec contra mandata sint, illa vero leaves quaedam culpae
duntaxat praeter ipsa commissae. -- Verum hanc senten^iam pe^^ulti Scholastici
impugnant, and contra mandata illa esse affirmant. Eorumque sentententia
communior nunc videtur in Scholis. Vega de Iustif. l. 14. c 13. initio.
Vega (who lived in the time of the Council of Trent, and was an actor
therein) called the more common judgment of the Schoolmen. And it stands
upon an invincible reason, which their Jesuit Valentia acknowledges, to wit;
Nam vbi lex non est, neque praeuaricatio legis, inquit Apostolus. Et id o David
praeuaricantes reputauit omnes peccatores terrae, quoniam ne intelligi quidem
peccatu^ potest, quod non sit legis alicuius tran^gressio. Greg. Val. Ies. de
diff. vet. and nouae legis, part. 2. c. 2.. Denique.
No man can conceive of sin, but as it is a transgression of the law. And can
there be a proper transgression of a law, which is not formally contrary unto
the law? Therefore does their Vega wish men to Et decet vbique vt nostros
sermon, and Scripturis, and sanctoru^ Patrum verbis attemperemus. Idque vt
faciamus, imprimis statuendum est, peccata venialia esse proprie and
simpliciter peccata. Sunt namque actus mali simpliciter, quippe qui voluntarij,
and circa materiam indebitam, and a recta ^atione deuiant ac dissentiunt, and
poena and reprehensione digni^ure apud omnes censentur: Et absolute concedendum

quicquid quidam magnus Doctor incaute dixc^it, displicere illa Deo, and propter
ea vere Deum offendi. Vega quosupra,. Et decet.
frame their speeches according unto Scriptures, and the words of ancient
Fathers, by accounting venial sins properly and absolutely sins simply
evil, because they are voluntary, and do certainly displease God. Which
diverse others our learned Adversaries have See above.
confessed to be (although by the mercy of God venial) yet in their own
nature mortal.

8 So now this their only refuge, in distinguishing venial and mortal, by
praeter and contra, like Jonas his gourd, is perished by the shine of the
confessed truth, and consequently the article of the Protestants is
established. For if none (as all confess) can live without sin, and that
every sin is a formal transgression of Gods law, and every transgression
moral is in nature mortal, then cannot any possibly be an absolute fulfiller
of the law of God. Which lesson our Adversaries may partly learn from the
shaue^ beards of their Priests, wherein they will have us to obseruea moral
signification, to wit: R^dendi baibae rationem Beda in Esdrae commentarijs
institutam esse dicit ad humilitatis recordationem, scil. ne Deo dican homines
magn^tudine aut multitudine virtutum suarum* in superbiam extollantur. Nam cum
barba, quae vitilis sexus and aetatis est index, fortitudinem, prudentiam,
aliasque virtutes significet perfecto viro dignis; idcirco eam sancti viti
abscindere vel abradere iubentur, vt ex hoc intelligant, oportere eos omnem
propriae virtutis considentiam abijcere, and meminisse virtutes suas, quamtum
libet magnas and multas, vitijs esse permistas, and proinde paucas esse ac
paruas, aut sere nullas, si diuino aequitatis examine discutiantur, dicente
Dauide, Non intres in iudicium cum seruo tuo, Domine, quia nullus viuens in
conspectu tuo iustificabitur. Sixtus Senens. S. Bibl. l. 5. Annot. 244..
Radendi.
Whereas a beard being proper to the man, betokens manhood, wisdom, and
other worthy virtues; the shauing of them away does put them in mind, that
they are not to place consi^^ence in their virtues, but to remember, that
although they be many and notable, yet are they mingled with vices; and
therefore are they to be accounted little and few, or almost none at all, if
they be examined by the exact rule of Gods justice. To conclude, the Romanists
in discerning of venials, do resolve, that the Si docti dubitant de aliquo,
securior pars in conscientia est eligenda: securior autem pars est, agnoscere
culpam, vbi non est. Binseldius Enchirid. Theolog. Pastoral.
part, which is more secure in conscience, is to be chosen, and this to be the
securer part, to acknowledge a fault where there is none. By the same rule the
doctrine of Protestants who rather judge their sin to be mortal, is proved
to be more secure and safe.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Justifying the accused by their own direct
Protestations.
SECT. 1.
BEza protests against the Nestoria^s, saying, Fatemur personam Filij ab ipso
momento, quo caro ipsius con^epta fuerit, vnitam fuisse humanae naturae
inseparabiliter, ita vt non sint duo filij Dei, sed vnus Christus Jesus, verus
Deus, and verus homo. Beza confess. art. De Jesus Christo. cap. 22.
We confess the person of the Son from the moment of his conception of
flesh, to have been unseparably united unto the humane nature, so that there
are not two Sons of God, but one, even Christ Jesus, true God and true man. And
again: It is manifest obstinacy of error in them who either confound the
natures of Christ, with Eutyches; or distract them with Nestorius.

2 Calvin protests against the Nestorians, as against furious and
phreneticke spirits, saying in detestation of them: Furiosi and phrenetici
spiritus attributa humanitatis Christi arripiunt, ad tollendam diuinitatem,
quae vero de vtraque natura sic coniuncte conueniunt, ad tollendam vt^amque; id
vero quid aliud est quam contendere Christum non esse hominem, quia Deus est,
nec Deum, quia homo est; nec vtrumque, quia Deus est homo, vnitis scil. non

Away with the error of the Nestorians, b Manifesta est pertinacia eorum, qui

who rather distract than distinguish the natures of Christ, against the
express voice of Scripture.

3 Luther protests against the Nestorians, saying: I was in a contention d
Co^^essed above in the accusation by Bellarmine, lit. c.
with the Nestorians, who did most obstinately affirm, that the Divinity of
Christ did not suffer. All these three who have been accused of the heresy of
the Nestorians, do renounce and condemn their opinion as the doctrine of
phrenticke and obstinate heretics. Wherefore we appeal to the conscience of
any man, to judge whether the forcing of obscure sentences of men should
preponderate in judgment, and prevail against their plain protestations; and
whether such Accusers might not by thus doing justify them, who accused that
just one for saying, Matthew. 26. 61.
I can destroy the temple, which they interpreted of the temple of stone, but
he meant of the temple of his body? Yet is not Luther fully acquitted, we
therefore exhibit

A justification of Luther in the point of Eutychianisme, by the testimony of
his Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
4 The Nestorians and Eutychians were as opposite as East and West, the latter
confounding the distinct natures of Christ, which the Nestoria^s distracted:
yet has the Accuser condemned Luther both for a Nestorian, and an Eutychian:
not unlike the man, who being asked where the wind stood, answered, East and by
West. But Luther has already freed himself from Nestorianisme.

5 In that which is urged for his conviction of Eutychianisme, Bellarmine. See
above in the Accusation, lit. c. in marg. And Coccius, Eutyches asserebat
diuinitatem verbi natam, passam, mortua^. Thesaur. Cathol. lib. 8. art. 3. Tom.
1.
Diuinitatem pati, and Diuinitatem natam esse, his Romish Adversaries will
justify him in their own Pope: for At, inquis, Vigilius and Cyrillus
orthodoxi scriptores, clauis diuinitatem affixam, and impassibiliter passam
esse affirmant. Sed certissimum est, Vigilium diuinitatem pro Deo ipso dixisse^
quia ea quidem ratione impassibiliter passus esse dici potest, quia cum idem
passus sit carne and humanitate, nihil tamen aut passus est, aut pati potuit
diuinitate, Greg. Valent. lib. 2 contra Vbiquit. cap. 1.. At inquis.
both Cyrill and Pope Vigilius, who were orthodoxall writers, affirmed (says
their Jesuit Valentia,) Diuinitas Christi passa est, that is, The Divinity of
Christ suffered impassibly, being nailed unto the Cross: but it is certain
(says he) that Vigilius by Divinity, or godhead, did mean God. So likewise
where S. Augustine doubted not to say, that the divine nature was borne of the
humane nature, their Jesuit Suarez easily discerns a divine truth in the
speech, saying that Dicit Augustinus, Natura aeterna atque diuina, non nascitur
ex humana natura, nisi secundum veritatem naturae humanae [ex quo effici
videtur, diuinam naturam concipi:] Respondeo, propter identitatem, quae in
diuinis est inter naturam and hypostasin, quandoque natura ponitur pro persona,
vel hypostasi. Et secundum hoc dicit Augustinus: Naturam diuinam esse
conceptam, and natam, quia seil persona Filij est concepta and nata secundum
humanam naturam. Aquinas part. 3. q. 35. art. 1. Merito dicit Thomas, esse hanc
improptiam loquutionem, and pie explicandam. Suarez in eum locum Thomae, Tom. 2.
S. Augustine respecting the Identitie, which there is between the nature and
the person of Christ, putting the nature in stead of the person, did say that
the divine nature was conceived and borne: which Aquinas called an improper
speech. Mark we now what a distorted creature an irregular affection is:
Augustine said, The divine nature was conceived: Luther said, The Divinity was
borne of the Virgin: both speeches are equivalent, and the one is favored, by
taking it for an improper speech, the other is condemned as sauouring of a
grand heresy. Again, Luther said, Diuinitatem pati, and their own Pope
Vigilius said, Diuinitas passa est; the phrases are all one, and yet lo
Vigilius was therein an Orthodoxe, and Luther is a damned heretic.

6 When we see this, we marvel not why Luther in his time being bandied among
such kind of racketers, did often say, Interim illud etiam noris, si iuxta
pronunciatum tui B^patris Martini Lutheri sc^leratum est, cum noueris pium and
sanum esse alicuius sensum, ex verbis incommode dictis statuere errorem Vt
re^^rt Tannerus Ies. Relat. Hunn Exam. cap 13.. Sed quia. page 129.
It is a lewd wickedness to fashion an error of such incommodious speeches,
the meaning whereof thou thy self know to be godly and sound. We rather
marvel with what boldness they du^st so falsely charge Luther with that
heresy of Nestorianisme, which their own Valla said was truly imputed unto
their own Neque aliquem sua dignitas ab increpationibus tutum reddidit, quae
Petrum non reddidit, multosque alios codem praeditos gradu; vt Marcellum, quod

Donat. Constant. apud Fascic. rerum expetend. and fugi^id. sub init^um.
Pope Celestine; especially if we consider (supposing that both Luther and
Celestine had been guilty of the same heresy) that yet the danger is greater
on their parts than on ours: for Luther among Protestants, is but one of all;
but a Pope among the Romanists, is all in all.

Seeing that our Adversaries hold th^se ancient heresies for Articles of faith,
it follows, that their profession is heretical.

THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROTESTANTS JUSTIFICATION.
SECT. 3.
7 We have hitherto seen a (...), a maine distance between the profession of
Protestants, and the doctrine of the heretics, unto whom they have been
resembled: differing as much See above cap. 16.
from Simon Magus, and the Eunomians, as do a living and dead faith, or an
obstinate and a penitent sinner: Cap. 17.
as much from the Florini, as, God did, and God did not create evil: as much
Cap. 18. Sect. 3
from Proculus as sin reigning, and sin rebelling in the regenerate: as
much Cap. 19.
from Seruetus, as embracing from burning: as much Cap. 20.
from the Tritheits, as approving and conde^ning: as much Ibid Sect. 3.
from the Arians, as rejecting all traditions, and allowing some: as much Cap.
21.
from Iouinian, as virginity corrupted, and not corrupted: as much Cap. 22.
from the Pelagians in the first point, as Original corruption is no sin,
and It is a great sin; and also in the second Ibid. Sect. 4.
of sins called venial, as to say, they are not venial by grace, from
saying, that they are venial in their own nature: as much Cap. 18.
from the Peputians, as a woman from a man: as much Cap. 23.
from the Nestorians, as to profess and defy. Besides the objection of Cap.
17. Sect. 2.
Origenisme, in saying the Image of God was lost in man: or of Cap. 19. Sect. 2.
Manicheisme, in censuring the sins of the old Patriarchs: or of Cap. 20.
Arianisme, concerning the excellency of the Father: wherein Protestants have
been justified by the confessed suffrages of ancient Fathers; and thereby their
distance from the pretended heretics is found to be no less than error and
truth.

8 By all these we discern the malign humor of the Accusers, who whilst
they contend to co^demn Protestants in their innocency, do but like those
gropers who Genesis 19.
(ought for to apprehend Lot, but could not truly find the door. Wherefore we
may well think, that as it was wisdom, and (it may be) conscience in the
Apologists to omit these other heresies: so it was cunning in them to say, We
omit them. After this so necessary digression, we return to the Apologists.

CHAP. XXIIII. Of some Romish heresies.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY:
Secondly, we do hereunto add in further demonstration, that whereas on the
one part our learned Adversaries are not able to show, that any of the
Cath^like writers of those af^resaid 160. years, did note or charge the then
Bishops of Rome with Innoua^i^n or cha^^e of faith; so again we on the
contrary are able to give particular proof, how that the Cath^like Fathers of
those same times, In those times was Leo the first, Bishop of Rome, begin^ing
anno 440. and continuing Pope 21. years: (test Anastasio de vitis Romans
Pontific.) of the communion which other Bishops of that age professed to have
with him, read Leo Epist. 39. and 41. c. 1. and the Epistle of I heodoret (a

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Noting Romish heresies in ancient Popes, before the
foresaid 160. years: by the confession of our Adversaries.
SECT. 1.
FAlse accusations (as S. Basil says) do oftentimes reuerberate, and echo
upon the Accusers themselves; which peradventure may be verified in our Romish
Adversaries, who whilst they call Protestant, heretics, may hear the same
voice reflecting upon their own Popes: which, by this their demonstration, we
are compelled to reveal, both in the first 440 years, which were before the
foresaid 160, (which makes up 600) as also in the years next after the same.
Of the first sort.

2 Pope Scribit Tertullianus in libro contra Praxeam, Romans Pontisicem
agnoscentem prophetias Montani, and ex ea agnitione pacem Ecclesi^s Asiae, and
Phrygiae inferentem, a Praxea fuisse persuasum, hteras pacis reuocare, quas iam
emiserat. -- Quare Rhenanus in annot. ad Tertull. ponit hoc loco in margin,
Episcopus (meaning Zepherinus) Montamzat. Et paulo p^st:
Zepherinus lived about the year 198, and is noted by Tertulli^n to have
acknowledged the prophecies of Montanus, that is, (as their Rhenanus expounds
it) was a Montanist. But our adversaries profess Respondeo, non esse on nino
fidem habendam Tertulliano in hac part quandoquidem ipse Montanista erat. --
Credibile est Zepher number persuasum fuisse -- fals^ de illis erroribus accusatos
fuisse Montanistas. -- Hoc autem non est e rare circa fidem, nec Montanizare,
vt mentitur Rhenanus, sed errare circa persona^, id quod multis alijs sanctis
v^ris accidit. Bellar. l. 1. de Romans Pont, c 8.. Sexto, etc.
not to credit Tertullian herein: and Rhenanus they do discredit, and slatly
give him the lic. Whose testimony notwithstanding may seem more credible,
because our Adversaries have nothing but a coniecturall Credibilitie to oppose
against it.

3 Pope Marcellinus (who lived Anno 296) is recorded in ancient histories to
have committed Idolatry: which their Fatemur siquidem fieri posse vt Petri
successor idola colat (quod B. Marcellinum secisse aiunt) and apud se forte de
fide non recte sentiat, adeo que dia^olicis artibus operam nauet: -- sed id

vel haeresin docere alios posse, vel errorem proponere. ^^s^erus. I^s.
^nchirid. cap 3. page 137. Fatemur.
Jesuit grants might happen unto their Pope; but yet that any Pope did, or
could ever teach others any heresy, this (says he)) we constantly deny. As
though the public practice of Idolatry were not in it self a profession of
the most devilish heresy. Therefore did their Cardinal Bellarmine show,
although less constancy, yet more policy, who when he had Concessimus S.
Marcellinum idolis sac^ificasse. Sed non videtur ^d o vnino certum. Bellar.
Recog. lib. de sumin^ Pont. page 20.. Eodem.
confessed the idolatrous fact of Marcellinus, did afterward call the truth of
the story into question.

4 Pope Liberius lived in the 350 year, concerning whose heresy we have the
testimony of these ancient O^. Athanasias vero and Hieronymus locis citatis
ap^^te dicunt, eum taedio exilij inflexum tandem fuisse ad subscriptionem
haereseos: quibus addi potest Hilarious qui in lib. aduersus Constant. ita

Fathers, to wit, Athanasius, Hierome, and Hilary noting him to have subscribed
unto the heresy of the Arians. Our Adversaries would have us think that he did
not directly subscribe, but by his outward communion with the Arians, and
consenting to the persecuting of Athanasius, ( Athanasius Columna Ecclesiae
aduersus Haereticos. Posseuinus (...) Apparat. Tit. Athanasius.
who was the pillar of the Catholic Church, and the principal adversary
against those heretics) he caused men to think that he had given his
subscriptio^ unto that heresy: insomuch that the fame went the^ for curra^t

every where, that Liberius had subscribed unto Arianisme. And not this only,
but that the the^ Roman Catholics Tamen quod adeo turpiter Constantio

legitimus Romans Ecclesiae Pontifex: existimatusque Liberius, ob manfestam cum
haereticis communicationem ex epistolis ab eo scriptis de conniuentia cum
Arianis, a communicatione Catholicorum prorsus extorris: impossible esse
iudicantibus cunctis, eundem Liberium communicare posse haereticis atque
Catholicis. Cum igitur adeo manifest constaret de eius communione inita
Sirinij cum haereticis, ex eo ipso necessario videbatur exclusus a communione
Catholica, atque ob id etiam a Pontificatus functione penitus alienus. Baron.
ibid. number. 57.
renou^ced Liberius, and adhered unto Felix as unto their lawful Pope: Tametsi
enim Liberius haereticus non erat, tamen habebatur, propter pacem cum Atianis
factam, haereticus, and ex ea praesumptione merito potuit ^^ Pontificatus
abrogari, non enim homines tenentur, aut possunt corda scrutari: sed que^
externis operibus haereticum esse vident, simpliciter haereticum iudicant, ac
vt haereticum damuant. Bellar. l. 4. de Romans Pon. c. 9.. Post.
because they examining him only according to his outward behavior, did
simply judge him to be an heretic. This is the best and fauourablest answer
that either Bellarmine, or Baronius, the chief Advocates for Liberius, could
return us in his behalf. But we say that he was actiuely an heretic, and
euince this from the sentence of the Fathers: Hierome saying, that Et in hoc
habebatur detestabilis (Fortunatianus) quod Liberium Romans vrbis Episcopu^, pro
fide ad exilium pergente^, primus solicitauit, ac fregit, and ad subscriptionem
haereseos compulit. Hieron, Catalog. Eccles. Tit. Fortunatianus. Tom. 1.
he did subscribe; See the object, above at the letter, c.
Hilarie, and S. See the Confession of Cusanus at the letter, m.
Augustine intimate, that as he was exiled by the Arians for resisting the
Arian heresy, so was he by them recalled again, and freed, because he
subscribed unto it. Cum Liberium Imperator reuocasset, praesentibus Legatis
occidentis, (...). Sozom. l. 4. c. 14. after the Greek. c. 15.
Sozomen expresses the subscription, even a confession, that Christ was not
(...) and consubstantiall with the Father; which is the rank poison of
Arianisme.

5 Secondly their own Romish Doctors, viz. Cardinal Et licet Liberius Papa

Vincentius, tell us of his subscribing unto the heretical sect; of his being
made an heretic, and by name an Arian; of his restoring to the Popedom by the
help of the Arians, which was attempted not without the murder and martyrdom
of Catholics, who did resist: wherein we see the interpretation of his heresy
written in blood. Could ever visible Church require more visible demonstrations
of an heretic, than these were?

6 Having so full and strong proof against this one, we may more easily pass
over the opinion of Pope Innoc^ntius the first (anno 402,) who defended it to
be a matter necessary unto salvation, Sancto Innocentio vide quid respondeas.

Pope Anastasius the second (anno 497,) whom our Adversaries themselves have
noted for one that Et Anastasium secundum huius nominis Pontificem fauisse

leave, for we are now called to look beyond the lists, and to prove

That after the prefined time diverse Popes have been branded with the marks of
heresy: from the testimony of our Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
7 Pope Honorius living about the year 622, came not above 22 years after the
160 now limited and prescribed by the Apologists; concerning whom we find the
Romanists in a civil war, as it were, fiercely battelling among themselves
about this question, whether he were a Monothelite, or no. First, his own Ob.

Sergium, vna in 6. Synodo, act. 12. altera ibid. act. 13. in vti aque aute^

debere dici, Christum duas habere voluntates, aut operationes. Bellar. l. 4. de
Pont. c. 11 initio.
Epistles are alleged against him: their Cardinal Bellarmine answers, that
Respondeo dupliciter: primo, fortasse illas epistolas esse confictas, and
insertas Concilio generali ab haereticis; quod enim hoc non temere dicatur,

those Epistles perhaps were forged, and inserted by heretics; which
notwithstanding their Cardinal Baronius acknowledges to In promptu est, vt de
eo integrari iudicium possit. and afferantur in medium caedem ab Honorio

Sergius, Cyrus, Pirrhus and others, who were then condemned for Monothelites.

8 Secondly, the sixth general Council of Constantinople is found to have
condemned Ob. Ex sexta Synodo Act 13. vbi damnatur Honorius tanquam hae eticus,
and comburuntur eius epistolae, and in seqq. Actionibus omnibus repetitur eius
damnatio. Bellar quo supra. Secundum.
Honorius: The Cardinal (to remove this brand of disgrace) contendeth to
prove, that Ad secu^dum ico, sine dubio Honorij nomen inter eos, qui damnantur

aliud ibi dicitur contra Honorium. Hoc probo primo, quia hoc testatur
Anastasius Bibliothecarius in historia sua ex Theophane Isauro Graeco. Bellar.
ibid.. Ad secundum.
the name of Honorius was foysted into that Synod among the names of the
condemned heretics, by those who then envied the excellency of the Church of
Rome. Were those envious ones heretics? the^ (Because Catholics would have
been as diligent to preserve them, as others to corrupt them.)
could they not: were they Catholics? the^ they would not corrupt the Acts of
their Councels, or suffer the^ to be so much depraved: but so it is, that the
integ^ity rather of Anastasius upon the life of Honorius, is s^lent, but Anno
683 in vita Leonis 2. says: Hic (id est, Leo secundus) suscepit sanctam sextam
Synodum, quae per Dei prouidentiam nuper in regia vrbe celebrata est, Graeco
cloquio conscriptam exequente, ac residente piissimo ac clementissimo magno
Principe Constantino intra regale palatium eius, quod appellatur Trullus.

denuo praedicaturi fuerint, aut defensauerint. Sed and nunc duae voluntates and
operationes ipsius dispensatoris Christi, and Saluatoris Dei nostri dicatur,
sicut eadem Synodus studiosissime in Latinum translata declarat. Anastasius
Biblioth. hist. in vita Leonis, Anno Christi 683.
an hundred and fifty Bishops, who in Trullo proceeded against the
Monothelites, must suffer prejudice, tha^ that the credit of one Pope may be
impeached.

9 Thirdly, supposing (for he might foresee the former answer would be thought
too harsh) that the Synod of Constantinople had expressly by name condemned
Honorius; he doubts not to tell us, that the Quodsi aliquis adhuc non possit
adduci, vt credat corruptam esse 6. Synodum, is accipiat alteram solutionem,
quae est Iohannis a Turrecremata, lib. 2. de Eccles. cap. 93 qui docet Patres
6. Synodi damnasse quidem Honorium, sed ex falsa informatione, ac proinde in eo
iudicio errasse. Quamuis enim generale Concilium legitimum non possit errare,
vt neque errauit hoc 6. in dogmatibus fidei definiendis: tamen errare potest in
quaestionibus de facto. Bellarm. lib. 4 de Pont. cap. 11.. Quodsi.
Synod erred not in a matter of faith (says he) but in a matter of fact. But
herein he remembers not the Acts or Epistles of Honorius, whereby the Council
was induced to pronounce him an heretic, and forgets also his own
assertion (which will teach him to recant this answer) wherein he said, If Ob.
Caiaphas condemnauit Christum. -- Alij Catholici respondent, quaestionem tantum
de facto fuisse, non de iure, viz. an Christus esset necandus. At quaestio
illa, etiamsi de facto esset, tamen quaestionem de fide grauiss. inuoluebat, an
Christus esset verus Messiah. Bellar l. 2. de Conc. c. 8.. Proponunt 2.
in the Jews proceeding against Christ, the question of fact, (viz. whether
Christ were to be put to death) did contain in it a question of faith, to wit,
whether Christ was the Messiah or no; why must it not then likewise follow,
that this matter of fact, in condemning Pope Honorius of heresy, did comprise
in it this conclusion: Ergo, the Pope of Rome may become an heretic, (as well
as Sergius, or Macarius, or any other of the Monothelites, who together with
him were therefore condemned?) and consequently it contradicts the now
Article of the Roman faith.

10 If we ask why the grave Bishops of so famous a Council should err in
that matter of fact, their Cardinal Baronius can readily and roundly answer
us, that the Council Certe quidem Honorij epistola prius disqui^^nda fuit, and
tempus praesens, quo scripta est, considerandum, and ita de Honorio fuerat
ferenda sententia. At cum nullius poss^t erroris argui, vel haeresis nondum
cognitae in suspicionem adduci: cerium est, calumnio^e and leuiter admodum,
sicut in^^sse. Honorium haereticum appellari. Baronius anno Christi 633. number.

did not examine the Epistle of Honorius exactly enough, but lightly and
unjustly proceeded against him. Cease (good Reader) to marvel at this
boldness, considering who it is that answers thus, and for whom; a Cardinal
for a Pope: otherwise the answer way seem more than strange: except we shall
think this one Cardinal, who now many hundred years after handles this
cause, to be better seen in the matter, than were the foresaid three hundred
and fifty Bishops, who lived at the same time, and took The Council about
the 22. day of March, do read and discuss the epistle of Honorius. Act 12.
and proceeded not unto judgment, before the 28. day, in the Act. 13. where
they say*
six days deliberation about the Epistle of Honorius, which they said they
had Se retractasse Honorij epistolam, eamque vt alienam ab Apostolicis
dogmatibus execra^i, and authorem cum ipsa.
handled again and again, and in the end concluded an execution against both
the foresaid Epistle, and the Author thereof.

11 In the third place is produced the seventh general Council, pronouncing
Honorius an Anathema: but their Cardinal Bellarmine does quickly dispatch us
an answer: Ob. Te^tium ex 7. Synodo, act. vlt. vbi totum Concilium dic^t
Anathema Honorio. Bellar. l. 4. de Pont. ca. 11.. Tertiu^. Respondeo, Patres
septin ae Synodi -- deceptos fuisse ex 6. Synodo, quae vel corrupta erat, vel
per e^rorem Honorium damnauerat. Ibid.. Ad tertium.
This Council was deceived (says he) by the presidence of the former
Council. That is to say (if it be truly interpreted,) the Fathers of this
Council did attribute more credit unto the sixth Council of Constantinople, than
the now Cardinal will do.

12 Besides (which is the fourth objection) p an eight Council under Pope
Adrian the second, does acknowledge the former condemnation of Honorius In the
answering unto this, their Cardinal will be cautelous: for, If we understand
(says he) the acts of the sixth Synod as corrupted, then we say that Pope
Adrian was deceived by them: but if we hold the^ to have been perfect, then are
we to know, that granting (which the Cardinal denied) that Honorius had been
condemned in a Council, yet does he not call Honorius an heretic. And he
adds furthermore (which makes more against Honorius) that the Eastern
Bishops durst not condemn Honorius, without the consent of the Legates of Pope
Agatho: nor this only, but q Quartum ex 8. synodo, act. 7. vbi legitur, and
probatur epistola Conc. Romani sub Adriano 2. vbi Pontifex cum Concilio asserit
fuisse Honorium iudicatum post morte a Conc. 6 quia de haeresi accu^atus
fuerat. Bellarm. quo supra.. Quartum. Respondeo, Adrianum secundum cum Synodo
Romans non aperte dicere Honorium fuisse haereticum: sed solum dictum ei fuisse
Anathema ab Orientalibus, quia de haeresi accusatus fuerat. Vbi videtur
Adrianus iccirco dixisse ab Orientalibus anathematizatum Honorium fuisse, quia
sc^ebat ab Occidentalibus, id est, a Concilio S. Martini non fuisse
anathematizatum. Addidit autem Adrianus, etiam in causa Honorij non fuisse
au^os Orientales sententiam dicere in Honorium, nisi Romans sedis consensus
praecessisset, quia sciebat legatos Agathonis consensisse in damnationem
Honorij. Atque haec quidem dicimus, si defendantur acta 6. Synodi tanquam
integra. Nam si dicamus esse corrupta, respondendum erit, Adrianum deceptum
fuisse ex deprauatis illis actis sextae Synodi. Bellarm. ibid.. Ad quartum.
(which is yet more) Hactenus Adrianus, vbi etiam addit, sententiam in Honorium
l^tam ex Romans Pontificis consensu fuisse. Id quod exploratum est in 6. Synodo
generali, Act. 4. Canus locis theol. l. 6. c. vlt. page 213. b.
Pope Adrian further adds (says their Canus,) that the sentence which passed
against Honorius, was with the consent of the then Pope of Rome.

13 In the fifth objection comes in Pope Leo the second, Ob. Sextum ex Leone 2.
qui in epist, ad eundem Imperatorem, quae habetur ad finem Concilij, eundem
Honorium execratur, tanquam qui sedem Apostolicam sua haeresi contaminauerit.
Bellar. quo supra.. Sextum.
execrating Honorius for defiling the Apostolical See with heresy. At this
the Ad sextum dico, epistolam Leonis ab eisdem esse corruptam, a quibus
corrupta est 6. Synodus. Siquidem epistola illa pars quaedam Concilij censetur,
and cum ip^o Concilio circumfertur. Vel certe Leo sequutus est iudicium
Legatorum Agathonis, ne disturbaret negotium iam confectum: sed non tenemur nos
magis vnum Leonem sequi, quam tot ali^s summos Pontisices, praesertim in
quaestione de facto, quae ad fidem non pertinet. Bellar. ibid.. Ad sextum.
Cardinal (after some other Proved to be insufficient, because the Epistle is
recorded as vncorrupt: In libro preterea Pontificali refertur Leo secundus
sextam Synodum suscepisse, in qua condemnati sunt Cyrus, Honorius. Melchior
Canus loc. theol. l. 6. c. vlt. page 213 b. And concerning the Legates of Pope
Agatho, it follows in the next Objection.
insufficient conjectures) waxes wroth with this Pope Leo: We are not bound
(says he) rather to follow Pope Leo, than other Popes (which Popes spoke not
any thing of Honorius) especially in a matter of fact. Well* ^et this censure
of Pope Leo in this matter of fact, thinking that a Pope had defiled the Sea
Apostolic with heresy, does cross and contradict the now Romish faith, which
teaches that the Popes chair was always an infallible Oracle of truth.

14 There follows the last objection from the proceedings of the Legates of
Pope Agatho, who being present in the sixth Synod, suffered ( See above at the
letter, q.
not without the consent of the then Pope) the foresaid Cur igitur, inquies,
Legati Agathonis non reclama^runt, cum Honorius damnaretu^? Respondeo id factum
esse ad euitandum mai^s malum: Verebantur enim Legati, si reclamarent, ne
impediretur definitio rectae fidei, and non posset tolli schisma, quod annis
60. iam durauerat. Nam damnabantur in eo Concilio Patriarchae multi
Constantinop. Alexand. Antioch. quorum successores non facile acquieuissent,
nisi etiam Honorius damnaretur, qui vna cum illis accusatus fuerat. Bellar. quo
supra. Cur igitur. False, for the Legates defended Pope Vigilius in the same
Synod, act. 3. 12. and 14. because he was unjustly accused. therefore must
Honorius be thought to have been justly accused, because the Legates did not
defend him.
Honorius to be condemned in the Council. The sum of the Cardinals answer
is, that the Legates of the Pope chose rather that Pope Honorius should be
condemned, than that they would disturb the proceeding of the Council against
Sergius, and other heretics; who would not willingly have yielded unto the
sentence of the Synod, except Honorius, who was accused of the same heresy,
had together with them been likewise condemned. In the which answer the
Cardinal has excelled himself, accounting it a Romish policy in some case
to satisfy guilty persons, by condernning an innocent. Which answer is, for
iniquity wonderful, but much more for the incongruitie thereof, especially
seeing that it proceeds of that School and prefession, which had rather all
other Churches should be thought guilty in condemning, than to acknowledge one
Pope (whom they make the universal head of the Church) worthy to be condemned.

15 In conclusion, he professes, in defense of Honorius, to oppose Ad
septimu^, ob^^cio authors authoribus, plures paucioribus, and antiquiores
recentioribus. Nam Maximus, qui tempore Honorij vixit, -- Theophanes Isaurus,

1191) is known by his decree to have dissolved the Celestinum 3. Alphonsus de

although this his sentence were sometime registered among the decretall
Epistles of Popes, yet was this not a decree Apostolical, and proceeding out
of the chair. Notwithstanding we know that their own Popes have thought, that
nothing can be held to be delivered more E Cathedra, than are such their
public decrees: commanding Innocentius: -- Ita nostra declaratione custodiri
mandamus, vt si quis in illa commiserit, veniam sibi denegari nouerit deinceps.

even as the ordinances confirmed and ratified by the voice of S. Peter.
Whereupon their own Castro has concluded, that Neque talis error fuit, vt
dicamus illum errasse vt priuatam personam, and non Papam, quoniam huiusmodi
Celestini definitio habebatur in antiq^is Decretalibus, quam ipse vidi and

Pope Celestine, even as Pope, did fall into the forenamed heresy.

17 Let them defend Pope John 22, who (anno 1410) taught, that none can enjoy
the presence of God before the day of resurrection. For although they

answer us either, that this opinion might at that time be defended without
danger of heresy, because it was never condemned before, or that he did not
resolutely define it* or that afterward he was not compelled to recant it; yet
have we to oppose, from their own Authors, against the first, that this
doctrine before this time was accounted an Sexta haeresis docet, nullam animam

second, that Pope John did fo fully define it, as (for this their own Pope Sed

Adrian testifies) to teach it publicly, and to declare and command it to be
believed of all men, and to suffer none of the University of Paris to take any
one degree in Divinity, before he had given his oath to maintain this doctrine
as long as he lived. Unto the third, that Johannes 22. quaestionem mouit, vtrum

consequerentur, -- sub Anathematis fulmine literatos hanc quaestionem in

18 Let them contend to purge Pope John 23, who (anno 1417) was accused of a
most pernicious heresy. For notwithstanding they answer, that either

The conclusion of the Apologists former Demonstration.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Whereby also it is (in our opinion) most evidently yet further pr^ued, that
during all that mean time of the foresaid 160 years, the Bishops of the
Roman Church did not com^ to the profession of our now religion, by means of
any their then ^^uised Innovation or change in faith.

THE PROTESTANTS CONCLUSION, From the premises.
SECT. 4.
19 We now see the Demonstration of the universal communion, which ancient
Fathers are said to have had with the former Bishops of Rome, and what it does
especially demonstrate, namely, the incircumspection of these opponents: except
they will associate the Fathers of more and less ancient times in fellowship
with their Popes in Montanisme, idolatrous Pagantsme, Arianisme, Nestorianisme,
Monothelitisme, (and to pass others) the worst of all others, more than
Denying not only the resurrection of the body, but cuen the immortality of
the soul also. See the last heresy of John 23. in this chap. Sect. 3.

Insomuch that M. John Napeire (though our great Aducrsarie) affirms and

Antichristian and Papisticall reign has begun, reigning universally, and

Revelations, fol. 110. a. and 123. b.
M. Brocard also professes to agree: whereby it is more then evident, that our
religion being thus publicly professed in the Roman Church both before and
ever since the foresaid 160 years, could not therefore be any matter of
Innovation of change, newly brought in or devised by the Roman Church, either
then or afterward.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: Concerning the Inuisibilitie of the Church; from the
testimony of their Romish Adversaries.
SECT. 2.
2 These recocted coleworts have now three or four times been presented by the
Apologists, in steed of chief dainties to cheer up their guests: but what
talk we of delicates? they glory so often and so exceedingly in these
testimonies of Napier, and Brocard, as though in them they had fixed the Basis
and foundation of their Apology. But with what insolidity this is performed,
we have partly shown, and now do more plainly demonstrate, by examining both
the position of the Inuisibility of the Church, and also the Application
thereof.

3 Nothing seems unto our Adversaries to be more prejudicial unto the
profession of Protestants, than is the term of visibility of the Church,
wherein the Romanists do place a demonstratiue note of a true Church, requiring
that the Church has The Rhemish Tra^slators annota^. upon Act. 11. page 323.
been ever since the ascension of Christ notoriously seen and known, their
preaching open, their Sacraments, discipline, and government visible; in such
sort as to Voluit enim Christus non modo visibilem esse Ecclesiam, sed valde
conspicuam, vt omnibus innotesceret gratia Dei, quae in hac sancta
congregatione, and non alibi, asseruatur, atque confertur: vnde eam eiuitati,

Costerus Enchirid. cap. 2. de Eccles.. Sit ne. page 111.
be very conspiciously manifested unto all, for the which cause it is compared
(says this Jesuit) unto a city placed upon the top of an hill.

4 Notwithstanding, other Jesuits are glad to modifie their opinion of the
visibilitie of the Church, and to confess of the time past, viz. Iam vero ad
varias Sectariorum argutias hoc loco refellendas, diligenter animaduerti debet,
non sic accipiendum esse, quod dicimus, Ecclesiam esse semper conspicuam, quasi
velimus eam omni tempore dignos^i posse aeque ^acile (...) enim ijs illam
aliquando errorum, schisma^um, persecutionum s^uc^ibus esse agitatam vt
imperatis quidem, n^c satis prudentes rations temporum, rerumque
circumstantias aestimantibus, ^^gnitu fuerit d^fficilis: quod tum max me
accidit, cum Arianorum perfidia in orb pene toto dominabatur. Nam and eo
tempore scripsit Hieronymus Ecclesiae nauen fuisse fere obrutam; and Hilarious
pluribus admonuit verbis, non fuisse Ecclosiam tunc temporis in tectis and
exteriori pompa quaetendam, sed potius in carceribus and speluncis. Non igitur
negamus, quin fuerit alio quam alio tempore difficilius Eccles^am dignoscere:
hoc tamen asserimus, semper illam potuisse a prudentibus rerum aestimatoribus
internosci. Etenim illo ipso tempore, quo videbatur latere, cum praeteritis
temporibus collato, dep^ehendi potuit Ecclesiam non apud multitudinem eorum,
qui religionem innouabant, sed apud paucos illos potius fuisse, quid quod
veteres illi Ecclesiae Patres, and fideles omnes, magno consensu diuturnisque
temporibus tenuerunt, consectabantur. Greg. Valent. Analys. l. 6. c. 4..
Probatio 4.
In the time when the Arian heresy seemed to prevail almost throughout the
whole world, that then the Church was hardly discernable, but only unto men of
great prudencie, insomuch that this ship (the Church) was then (as Hierome
said) almost sunk: it consisting not in the multitude of Innouators, but in
the paucit^e of true believers.

5 And concerning the time of Antichrist afterward to be revealed, they doubt
not to acknowledge, that The Rhemists in their annot. upon 2 Thessalonians. 2. page

There is like to be a great revolt of kingdoms, and people, and provinces,
from the open external obedience, and communion of the Church; so far, that

due honor of Christians toward it, and communion in heart with it, and
practice thereof in secret, and open confession thereof, if time require, *

places, where an open entercourseis forbidden. In this argument they are very

6 Add we hereunto that which their Cardinal has acknowledged in the behalf
of Protestants, that they do not teach, that See above in this (...) cap. 14.
Sect. 2.
the Church of Christ can fail, but that it may be invisible unto the world,
although not to the professors themselves. And now Protestants and the
Romanists do concur in words, and almost also in sense, wherein the Church of
Christ is said (in respect of the outward profession, persons, and worship) not
to be discernable, or visible: so that the difference is not so much in the
position, as in

The Application of the Inuisibilitie of the Church.
SECT. 3.
7 Master Napier and M. Brocard both commenting upon the Apocalypse, and only
supposing that the Donation, which the Romanists pretend to have been made by
the Emperor Constantine unto Pope Syluester, was true, do apply the entrance
of Antichrist unto Syluester: I aurentium Vallam scimus integrum libru^
aduersus receptam communi opinione sententiam declamasse, Iutispe. riti quae
vulgo circumfertur eius donationis formula, eam commentitiam esse satis
indicant, cum Paleae inscriptiones denotant. Eusebius, Ruffinus, Theodoretus,
Socrates, Zozomenus, Eutropius, Victor, caeterique probae fidei authors, qui
omnia Constantini gesta scripsere diligentissime, non modo nullam donationis
eius mentionem faciunt; sed tradunt etiam orbem Romanum sic inter tres illius
filios distributum, vt Italia vni eorum tota contigerit, etc. Melchior Canus
loc. the^l. l. 11. c. 5.. Quod deinde.
Which Donation the Romish Lawyers and Canonists have judged fabulous,
intituling it, for that cause, palea, that is, chasse. Whereof (say they)
Eusebius, Ruffine, and other Ecclesiastical Historians, make no mention at
all; and whereunto their At Pius Pontifex, sed ^lus rerum vetustate inuolutarum
indagator, in nobili illo Dialogo, quem ante Pontificatum in Germania edidit,

di^putando an id valuerit, quod nullo vnquam tempore fuit, Balbus Episc. lib.
de Coronat. page 49.
Aenaeas Syluius (afterward Pope) gave no credit, but called it a bastardly and
counterfeit device, inueighing against those who contended for it as being in
it self good, which yet never had being at all. Yet this worme-eaten poast is
become the pillar of the obiectd Conclusion.

8 Wherefore the Apologists in this one objection (which they For four or five
times is it repeated in the whole Apology.
have so often repeated) have strayed into three erroneous bypath. First,
that which our forecited Authors spoke of Syluester, as of a point c
pretended, or So Br^card: [Apoc. 11. And the whole city shall they tread under
foot.] This judgment seems to have b^n pronounced by Gods decree, even then
when the Pope fell from Christ, to wit, in the time of Syluester: but to be
finished in the sixth and seventh Trumpet. Which we g^ther by the 1260 days,
^ut for years, which 1260 d^yes make 42 mon^ths. And a little after: For this
cause I think, etc. Br^card vp^n that pla^^ of the Apoc. fol. 110.
coniectured only, that the Apologists enforce as a case defined and resolved.
Secondly, that which was applied only unto one point of Roman doctrine (which
is called See a^oue lib. 1. cap. 8.. 2.
Papacy, or papal Jurisdiction,) they enlarge unto an acknowledgement of all
Articles of the now Roman faith. Thirdly, that vndebatable contradiction unto
the Papal authority by him mentioned, the Apologists assume for a truth;
notwithstanding it have been (according unto the confessed light of story)
often and notoriously See confessed ibid. and lib. 4. cap. 2. 7 etc.
contradicted in Antiquity by noble Martyrs, famous Churches, general
Councels, and also (which we might have added) by right Christian and renowned
Emperors.

9 Finally, if one of our Adversaries themselves (when six of their principal
Doctors were pro^uced against him) was licensed to except against the^, saying,
The a^thor of the book called the Moderate answer unto the Discovery of the
Romish positions and practices for rebellion.
As though six private men could make a general Axiom; how much more lawful
might it be for us to deny the testimonies of but two Authors, not of eminent
note for learning and judgment, especially whilst they comment upon the
mystical book of Apocalypse, wherein (as men in a mist) they might sometime
miss their way? We expect of the Apologists some new and sounder proof.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Which point also is made as yet otherwise more manifest, by that which has
been heretofore confessed by our Adversaries, concerning the conversion See
heretofore Tract. 1. Sect. 1. in the marg. at the letter, d. an^ in the text at
the letter e, and ibid l. f. g.

10 We must confess that the Apologists have been rich in promising such like
manifestations and evidences, but upon discussing of particulars they have
manifested their wallet of a double want, the one hanging before, and the other
behind them: before in Among^t others Transubstantiation. See above lib. 1. c.

omitting some particulars, and material points, wherein S. Gregory was an
Adversary unto their now Romish profession. Whereunto they have added an
evidence of a notable p^euarication in their cause, whilst to make the
Brittons of Wales seem to have accorded unto the now Romish Church in See
above lib. 1. cap. 10.
All matter of importance, and knowing that they refused to be subject unto
Austen the Popes Legate, and consequently denied the now pretended universal
Jurisdiction of the Pope: they have made the chief head of the Romish faith, a
matter of smaller importance. And well it were with the now Britains, and with
other Christians, if it were esteemed a matter yet of smaller importance than
it is. Nevertheless the Apologists can see no rubs in their way, all seem
plain for them, even that also which follows, viz.

THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
So plainly is that faith which the Roman Church now professes, the very
same whereto the Romans were converted in the Apostles times. A thing so
evidently true, that our A^uersarie M. Bunny (though using all wariness to
acknowledge or utter more then of n^ces^itie he must) confesses yet (as
enforced) and says of the whole time since the Apostles to this present, that
See M. Bunny in his treatise tending to Pacification Sect. 14. circa med. page
89.
the Church of Rome has ever continued after a sort in the profession of the
says, since the time that by the Apostles it was delivered to them, etc. and
has also in some manner preserved, and hitherto maintained both the Word and
the Sacraments that Christ himself did leave unto us; which surely (says he)
is a very special blessing of God, an evident work of the holy Ghost, etc.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 5.
11 After a sort, and in some manner, are terms indefinite, and have no
certain latitude; how far the Author did extend them, we know not; how far
he did not extend them, he himself does show, where (in the same Treatise) he
concludes, that the Romanists are no sound members of the Catholic Church,
both because (says he) they go directly contrary unto the Christian faith, and
also because they do vehemently impugn the revealed truth, and persecute the
professors thereof. Therefore the taking of these terms of this our Author,
[after a sort] and [In a manner the profession of the faith] which are but
inches, and the stretching of them unto so long an ell, as to be the [plainly
and evidently confessing, that the Roman Church professes the same faith (
For so they have inferred, reasoning thus: The same faith without any
innovation, or change: See the Apol. above,. 7. Unto the which faith, the
English were converted in the days of S. Gregory, in all subsubstantiall
points, which was the same with the now Roman Church in every particular. See
above lib. 1. c. 1. Sect. 1. And n^w again: so plainly is that faith.
in all substantial points) whereunto the Romans were converted in the
Apostles times,] argues no direct or plain dealing.

12 Howbeit, we know that the Jews (unto whom were committed the Romans 3. 2.
Oracles of God, and who carried his commandments in the Matthew 23. 5.
Phylacteries and fringes of their garments) did profess the faith of their
forefathers in some sort, and in some manner; when as yet by the Matthew 16. 6.
leaven of their Doctors (the Pharisees) the Matthew. 15. 3.
commandments of God were transgressed through their Traditions. So if we
should not acknowledge Gods holy providence, (as in the Greek) so in the
Roman Church, and some sort of profession of the ancient faith, by whom have
been preserved the laws of the commandments, containing the sum of moral
obedience; the Symboll and Creed Apostolical, which hold the sum of the
fundamental Articles of faith; the two Sacraments, Baptism and Eucharist,
which are the sacred seals of Gods promises; and the Scriptures of the old and
new Testament, in their first originals of Hebrew and Greek, being the
evidences of our heavenly Fathers will, and containing in them all truth
necessary unto salvation: we might be worthily judged both impiously
unthankful unto God, and enuiously malicious against that Church.

13 Nevertheless as God commanded the Deuteronomy. ^1. 26.
tables of the law to be kept in the Arc of the covenant for a witness
against the Israelites, if peradventure they should fall into idolatry and
superstition: so must we acknowledge the same wisdom of Gods holy providence
in the preservation of the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles in that sacred
volume of Gods book, which now serves unto us for our direction, and against
our Adversaries for a conviction of their wandering from Apostolical
sincerity. After this our so long travel in this Ocean of controversies, we
long greatly to come within the kenne of land: and now behold,

THE ROMISH APOLOGISTS.
And thus much briefly whether that the Roman Church professing the right
faith in the Apostles times, has at any time since ever altered or changed the
same: against our aforesaid discourse whereof grounded upon several truths
confessed even by our adversaries, if any bolder forehead shall wilfully oppose
it self and shall without other answer or respect had to that which his
learned brethren have heretofore confessed, and we otherwise proved, leap over
all the aforesaid proofs and ages, iumping per saltum up to the Apostles, and
then tell us, So M. Whitaker lib. 7. contra Duraeum, page 478. ante medium,
says, Nobis sufficit ex Pont^ficiorum do^matum, and Scripturarum collatione
discrim^n and dissim. litudinem agnoscere: Instoricis liberum relinquimus
scribere quid velint.
that howsoever we prove from histories and Fathers or other testimony of their
own writers, concerning every of the ages since the Apostles times, yet the
Scriptures themselves are (in his Hereof see hereafter Tract. 2. cap. 1. Sect.
1 initio, in the margent at the letter, p. and at, q.
opinion) contrary in many points to that faith which the Roman Church now
professes, and that therein therefore she has changed the faith which was
first to her delivered:

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 6.
14 Howsoever this Saltus, or leaping over customs, which carry in them the
color of Antiquity, and provoking our Adversaries to demonstrate the
profession of their doctrine in the Apostles times, seem unto the Apologists
to be no better than the bodily iumping, viz. an act or passion of a bolder
forehead, or a distempered brain: yet may they be informed that by the example
of the ancient Fathers, who passing over the error of the Chiliasts, leapt over
a See confessed above lib. 4. cap. 16. Sect. 3. and lib. 2. cap. 25. 9
the paces of 300 years, wherein it continued, and pitched their footings upon
the Apostles doctrine for their better satisfaction; and the Romanists
themselves in the disanulling the use of administration of the Eucharist unto
See above lib. 2 c. 13.. 3. and lib. 4 cap. 16. Sect. 3.
infants, did, as it became them, iumpe over the space of 600 years, fixing
their resolution upon the contrary practice of the primitive Church: yea and
in that general corruption of doctrine among the Jews, who put away their
wives upon any occasion, in the which error they continued (nothing being
shown to the contrary) many thousands of years; our Savior Christ, for the
reforming of that abuse, went not step by step, from time to time, to show them
the original when and by whom it first began: but (if we may so speak with
reverence) iumping, or rather flying over all the interceding ages, does show
when it was not, and takes a direction from the first institution, saying,
Math. 19. 8.
From the beginning it was not so.

15 Not that we need thus to proceed in all cases, (as the Apologists do
injuriously pretend, by mistaking our The sentence of D. Whittaker was spoken
only by way of concession, supposing it true, after the manner of a disputer;
and not by way of confission (as these Apologists pretend) to grant it true,
that all history is against us: for thus both the place of D. Whittaker
shows, page 468. saying, Quanquam in externis ritibus ^xigua sit mut^tio,
tamen de summis fidei capitibus, quam nos profitemur, illa primae multorum
seculorum Ecclesiae, de quibus tam multae historiae extant, propagatunt. And

with others do vindicate the first age after the Apostles, for the space of
400. years, to be of their side.
Authors concession for a confession) for we passing on according to the tracts
of time, by just paces, have found out the first footsteps of many Romish
Innouations, according unto the diue^se confessions of the Romanists themselves.

16 Nevertheless, when we come unto a bogge of uncertainty concerning the
first originals of errors, the^ will leaping be necessary, lest otherwise the
blind leading the blind both fall into the ditch: and so much the rather,
because we know that thus it happens in many points, which our Adversaries
have confessed concerning some few, as namely, of the now office and dignity
of their See above lib. 4. cap. 19. Sect. 4.
Cardinals; of Papal See ibid. cap. 25. Sect. 1.
Indulgences; See ibid. cap. 18. Sect. 5.
Prayer in an unknown tongue; and See ibid. cap. 22. Sect. 1.
Communion in one kind; that they indiscernably crept into the general
practice of the Church by little and little. So that these premises duly
considered, the only question must be whether a man should prefer their
creeping errors before our iumping truths. Have they any thing further to
object besides these? d See co^fess^d throughout the 4. book.


CHAP. XXVI.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY.
Besides, that this is a most needy and miserable begging of the thing in
question, against which we d^ v^hemently contest, (as being more then persuaded
that our adversaries cannot truly ^^^edge from the first of Genesis to the last
of the Revelations, so much as any one text of Scripture, which makes with
them, and against us.)

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 1.
BY this contestation we are greatly provoked to give some instances against
this their so peremptory a challenge. They might have gratified us very much
to have popounded some one controversy, wherein we might have insisted: which
task we neither could nor would have refused: but now in such a multitude of
examples, wherewith we superabound, only copia nocet; for our first
difficulty is, where to begin, and the next, when to make an end.
Nevertheless seeing the matter is left unto our choice, it may not offend
them, if we imitate Moses in his history, who said, In the beginning God
created, etc. and S. John in his Gospel, who said, In the beginning was the
Word, that is, (as Basil teaches) (...); to begin at the beginning and head of
our controversies in Popery, which we take to be Popedom it self, and to
try whether the Scriptures, which are alleged for, or against the
jurisdiction of the Pope, make for the Roman party, debating the matter by
Objections and Solutions, and that only from the arbitrements of our Romish
Adversaries, not suffering any Protestant to interpose one word.

2 First, they seek to make their Pope the universal Pastor of souls, and
Ezech. 37. 21. [Ecce ego assumam filios Israel de medio nationum, etc. Et Rex
vnus erit omnibus imperans:] and ver. 24. [Sernus meus David Rex super eos, and
Pastor vnus erit omnium corum] Ergo vnus esse debet Pastor vniuersalis, and
Monarcha Ecclesiae. Sanderus de visib. Monar. lib. 4. cap. 5.
object to this purpose, Ezech. 37. 24: There shall be one King, and one
Pastor: but yet give us a solution, showing, that David Christum significat,
quoniam David Christi figura su^t, and vsi^atum est in (...), figuratae trib^^
ita ^zech. 34. Et suscitabo super eos Pastorem vnum, qui pa^cat eos, Seruum

This is spoken of Christ the Son of God, and not to be absolutely fulfilled
before the last day of judgment. Yet again it is written, ( Oseae ^^vers. vlt

Whereby the Pope is implied. Sol. Maldonate, Pererius, Ribera, Salmeron, and
others, proving that Christ was meant, by properties only belonging unto
Christ. See above lib. 2. cap. 17. Sect. 7.
That precious corner stone was Christ.

3 Secondly, some Romanists enlarge the jurisdiction of the Pope so far as is
the wide world, and ob. Matthew. 28. 18. Unto me is given all power in heaven,
and earth:] Matthew. 28. 18. [Mihi data est omnis potestas in coelo, atque in
terra.] Pontifex habet principatum totius orbis, etiam quoad temporalia.
Carerius lib. 2 de potestate Rom Pont. c. 9. out of R^^eri^us (...). and
other^: ad ling the conclusion: Hanc esse Theologorum communem sententiam. And
this Scripture is used in the Pop^s Bull. See hereafter number. 18. Ita Petrus

This power (belonging unto Christ) is so great, as that it is not communicable

neither is there any Scripture which defends any so universal jurisdiction
of the Pope. But is there not some Scripture to confute it? Yes (Confut.) for

the authority of the Church, before that they be baptized: Therefore S.

4 Thirdly, when they cannot gain all the world, yet they contend to possess
all Christendom, challenging authority over all persons, even in temporal
causes, either directly, or at least indirectly: and ob. Genesis 1. verse. 16. [God
made two great lights, the greater to rule the day, and the less to govern
the night:] Secunda Canonistarum ostensio sumitur ex C. Solitae, de mayor. and

quae sunt Pontificalis, and Regalis: harum, quae praeest diebus, spiritualibus
scil. mayor est ac dignior ea, quae temporalibus praeficitur; vt quanta est
inter solemn and lunam, tanta inter Papam and Imperatorem cognoscatur
differentia Carerius de potest. Romans Pont. lib. 2. cap. 12. initio. Quare sic
f^rmo rationem: ea est proportio inter summum Pontifi^em and Imperatorem, quae
est inter Solemn and Lunam: sed ol praestantior est valde ac eminentior Lun^,
and haec ab illo mutuat splendorem and lucem. Igitur Papa est eminentior
Imperatore, and Imperatoris authoritas a summo Pontifice pendet. Carerius de
potestate Romans Pont. lib. 2. cap. 12.. Quare.
Where the Sun betokens the Pontifical authority, and the Moon the
Imperial: whereupon we gather, that as the Moon borrows her light from the
Sun, even so the power of the Emperor depends upon the Pope. Sol. Vnde hoc
modo disputo: Quemadmodum Luna non minus Luna est, nec minus per se consistit
tunc cum a Sole recedit, and mutuatum ab eo lumen e^^ans amittit, quam cum eius
radijs pleno o^be atque aspectu illustratur. and neutro casu haec ab illo, aut
ille ab hac dependet, etc. Parclatus de potestate Papae, cap. 13.. Sed and.
Or rather we may gather, that as the Moon consists of it self, without the
Sun, so does the temporal state, without dependence from the spiritual.
After that they by gazing upon the stars, have failed in their Astrology,
wherein shall they find a proof for any temporal power? Ob. Luc. 22. 38.
[Peter said, Behold here are two swords: and Christ answered, it is
sufficient:] Luc. 22. 38. [Dix^runt, ^cce duo gladi^^ at ille dixit. satis
est.] -- De hac Ecclesia ^^usque potestate (inquit Bonifacius Pont. 8. in

Signifying that both the spiritual and material sword were assigned unto
Peter, the one to be exercised by himself, the other at his beck and command.
Sol. De duobus gladij clarum est, quod in literali sensu nihil habetur: sed cum

euidentem Ecclesiae vtilitatem illis sobrio sanoque consilio suadebis, qui
gladium in sua potestate habent. Barelaius de potest. Papae, cap. 19. page 158.
This is not the literal exposition of the text, but detorted by new
expositors.

5 But put the case the Pope were as capable of a scepter, as of a key, of a
Crown, as of a Miter; of a Sword, as of a Crosier staff; what might he do
with his sword? might he use violence? Ob. Ioh. 21. 16. [Christ said unto
Peter, feed my sheep:] Ioh. 21. 16 Pasce oues] Ergo data est potestas
Pontifici aduer us lupos. Bellar. lib. 5. de Pont. cap. 7.. Quinta.
Which implies, that Peter being Pastor, must have power to drive away a
wolf, and consequently to depose any King, who shall become an heretic. Sol.
Non est ergo quod superiorem pro se rationem adferant: nam Christus quando
Petro dixit, Pasce oues meas, constituit cum quidem Pastorem gregis sui, sed
Pastorem spiritualem, non temporalem; deditque ei omnem facultatem ad id
muneris necessariam. Barelaius de potest Pap^, cap. 25. page 201. Swords for a
shepherd? what to do?
Not so, but his Pastorship being spiritual, his manner of driving away a wolf
must be also spiritual. Yet Ob. Ier. 1. 10. [Behold I have appointed thee over
Kingdoms, to eradicate, and to destroy, etc.] Paulus Episcopus, Seruus
se^uorum Dei, etc. Nos in iustitiae sede constituti, iuxta Prophetae

Which belonging unto S. Peter, do concern the Pope. Sol. Quod Ieremiae ad

Propheta? Si sapis, eris contentus mensura, quam tibi mensus est Deus: nam quod
amplius est, a malo est. Bernard l. 2. C^ns^d. ad Eugeniu^, cap. 6.
It was spoken of the ministry of Jeremy, who was to root out vice only by
preaching. All See Barclaius lib. de potest. Papae, through the whole book.
Antiquity, yea and many Romanists also, have writ in confutation of violence
used against the sacred Majesty of Kings, and do by their arguments ding out
the teeth of such heads, as feed upon flesh and blood Royal. Which
rauenousnesse is confuted by Scripture, where Popes are subjected unto the
sword of Kings. (Confut.) Romans 13. [Let every soul be subject unto the higher
powers, -- carrying not the sword in vain.] Their answer: om. 13. [Subijciatur
omnis atama sublimioribus potestatibus.] Apostolus hoc in loco non ^estringit
sermonem ad potestatem seculare^, sed de omni potestate loquitur (seil. tam
spirituali, quam seculari.) Ex qua sententia non deduci potest, Papam subditum
esse Regi, aut Regem Papae. Bellar. lib. 2. de Romans Pont. cap. 29.. Argumentum
3.
These words are not restrained unto the temporal power, but do as well
concern the spiritual, and therefore do not subject the Pope unto Kings.
Their reply: Apostolus docet credentes debere mundi potestatibus esse
subiectos. -- [Omnis anima:] id est (Chrysostomus ait) sieve Propheta, sieve
Apostolus, sieve Episcopus, sieve subditus sit. Sequitur Chrysostomum Euthymius,
Theod. Theoph. Oecumen. and qui non Graeci? Idem Gregorius Magnus agnoscebat,
and Bernardus ad Episcopum Senonensem idem colligit, [Omnis anima] tum vestra,
inquit, quis vos excipit? si quis tent^t excipere, tentat decipere. Espencaeus
Episc. com. in Tit. ^. Digress. 10. page 513. Qua de causa Paulus ipse ad
Caesarem appella^^t, and iussit Christianos omnes subiectos esse temporali
potestati Ethmcorum, non solum propter iram, sed etiam propter conscientiam.
Nam quod quidam dicunt D. Paulum non de temporali potestate seculariu^
principum illic loqui, sed de potestate in genere, vt quisque suo superiori
obediat, Laicus Laico, Ecclesiasticus Ecclesiastico, mera cauillatio est, and
responsum viris doctis, and Theologis indignum. Nulla siquidem tunc temporis
alia quam politica and temporalis potestas vulgo ab hominibus agnoscebatur, and
Apostolus diuino spiritu afflatus, ita scitas Epistolas conscripsit, vt non
solum conuersos ad fidem erudiret, suique officij commoneret, ne existimarent
se ita Christi sanguine redemptos, vt nulli amplius potestati seculari obedue
tenerentur. Barclaius de potest. Papae, cap. 3. page 21.
Yes, for S. Chrysostom and other Greek Fathers, in this subjection include
the Apostles. S. Gregory applies it against a Bishop. S. Bernard enforces it
upon the Pope.

6 Fourthly, if the left hand of temporal power be thus cut off, what is the
virtue of his spiritual jurisdiction? Is his judgment and sentence
infallible? This they pretend, and ob. Matthew. 23. [They (the Pharisees) sit in
Moses chair, all things that they shall say, do.] Bellar. Stapleton, Rhemists,
and others. See above lib. 3. c. 15. Sect. 5.
Where, by the chair of Moses is signified the infallibility of the
Priesthood under the law, and was a type of the truth of religion in the
Apostolic See of Rome. Sol. Erasmus, Iansenius, Stella, and their Jesuit
Maldonat. See above ibid.
This is a detorted sense, for Christ did not understand by Moses chair the
doctrine of the Priests, but the law of Moses; neither were they to be obeyed
further than that they taught according to that law. But it may be they could
not but speak law, for Ob. Ioh. 11. 51. [This said Caiphas, being high Priest
that same year.] Canus, the Rhemists, Roffensis. See above lib. 3. cap. 15.
Sect. 3.
Caiphas being high Priest, prophesied that Christ should die for the people,
how much more may we be assured, that Christ will never leave Peter's seat?
Whatsoever judgments are delivered by the Popes of Rome, in the behalf of the
whole Church, do proceed from the spirit of God, because the Popes do viter
them; for it is manifest that Caiphas delivered a true judgment. Sol. Cardin.
Bellarmine. See in the same place.
And it is manifest that Caiphas in his words next following (in saying that
Christ blasphemed) spoke blasphemy. Notwithstanding, Ob. Luc. 22. Simon, I
have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not; when thou art converted,
strengthen thy brethren. Perspiciet omnia (inserting, among^^ others, this
place of Confirmare caeteros) vel Sole clarius pro nostra sententia dimicare,

Whosoever sees not the primacie of Peter established by these words, is more
blind than a Moale. For hereby Peter received a double privilege; the first
was, that he in himself should never fail in faith, but persevere, without
stumbling, unto the end: the second, that when he as chief Bishop should
instruct others in the faith, he should always publish a truth. Peradventure
the former of these two does not descend upon his successors, but the second
doubtless does. Concerning the first privilege, Sol. Haec de B Petro. De
quncunque autem alio Papa, eius suceessore asseren lum, nihil prohibet, ipsum

seqq. Magna cum ^atione putandum est, Apostolos omnes non solum deficere non

They are but new Doctors, who affirm that the Pope, as a private person,
cannot err in faith. As touching the second: See confessed above in this
book, cap. 24. etc.
Some Popes, as Popes, have been publicly noted for heretics. As for the
point of strengthening his brethren. Id est, sicut ego orando te protexi
(inquit interlinear^s Glossa) ne desiceres, sic tu infirmiores fratres exemplo
tuae poenitentiae conforta, ne de ven^a desperent. Sa Iesuita schol in Iuc. 22.
See Arias Montanus, and Aquinas his Catena upon this place.
It is signified that when after his fall and repentance he was converted unto
grace, his example should strengthen other penitents, to keep them from
despair.

7 Lastly, upon pretense of Infallibility of the Popes judgment, they make his
authority incontrollable, not permitting him to be subject unto the authority
of a Council, and Ob. Luc. 12. 42. [Who think thou is a faithful steward,
whom the Lord, when he comes, shall place over his household?] Luc. 12. 42.
[Quis tu putas est fidelis dispensator, quem constable tuat Dominus supra familiam
suam?] Hinc int^lligunt omnes Patres Episcopum, ^uan^uis non express loquitur

Hereby, questionless, is meant that the Pope of Rome is made ruler over the
Church in judging it, and that he is not subject to be judged by it. Sol.

tacit innuit se prae^^dentem parabolam dixisse ad omnes, sed prae erum ad
Pastores Ecclesiae, vt Marc. 13. [Quod vobis dico, omnibus dico.] vnde and

Christ spoke not these words particularly unto any one kind of Pastors, but
generally unto all, as appears both by that which goes before, and by that
which follows the text. Yet they Ob Ioh 20. [VVhose sins you remit on

In the Latin translation it is said twice, Feed my Lambs, but once; Feed my
sheep: signifying that other Apostles and Pastors were but as it were, the
Ewes, in respect of other faithful, as their Lambs; and were subject unto
Peter, as the Pastor over all: and the evidence of this testimony cannot be
avoided. Sol. Non subtilite^ disputandum est, cur Christus agnos potitis quam

He that argues so subtly from the terms of Ewes and Lambs, must take
heed lest that he make himself ridiculous; for the words are indifferently
used. And why is not this great Monarch subject unto the judgment of the
Church, as formerly he has been? se^ing that S. Peter in his demand,
concerning the forgiving of an often-offender, was answered, Matthew. 18: If he
will not hear thee, tell the Church.] Ob. Matthew. 18. 17. Dixit Dominus Petro
[Si peccauerit in te frater, etc. si eos non audie^it, dic Ecclesiae.] Ergo
(ait Gerson, Doctor Parisi^nsis) debet Petrus and eius Successor defer
peccatores aliquando ad Ecclesiam: debet igitur agnoscere tribunal Ecclesiae
quoddam suo ma^us. Bellar. lib. ^. de Conc. cap. 19.. Sed iterum. Respondeo,

Although Gerson said, that therefore the Pope ought to acknowledge himself to
be subject unto the Church: yet we answer, that the Pope fulfi^leth this
precept, when he reproves a man in private, next by witness, and after shall
himself proceed unto public censure. Sol. [Dic Ecclesiae, etc.] Planus est,
and per se lucidu^ horum verborum sensus, nec suppletione, nec alteratione hic

nisi in generali Concilio conuenire, belliss* interpretatio erit, dic
Ecclesiae, id est, Concilio generali. -- Nec mea est interpretatio, sed
sanctorum Patrum, veterumque Doctorum, qui primi Ecclesiam illuminarunt. --
Greg. Papa; Si in mea correptione despicior, rest at vt Ecclesia^ debeam
adhibere, ^uae verba satis manifest Ecclesiam pro generali Concilio
suscipiunt. Apud Aenaeam Sylu^um, lib 1. comment. de gest Conc. Basil. fol. 6.
Christ said not unto him, Peter tell thy self, but tell the Church, which is
a congregation in a Council. Thus was it reasoned in the Council of Basil
against the Pope. Atque hinc prosecto illorum authorum sententia manifest
reuincitur, qui Concilium universal Pontifice superius faciunt: pugnant enim
illi reuera (licet non aduertentes) cum certissima fide de Diui Petri, ac
Roman. Pont^ficis in Ecclesia primatu Gregorius Valent. Ies. Analys. lib. 8.
cap. 7.. Atque hinc.
And whosoever (says their Jesuit) makes a general Council to be superior
unto the Pope, does indeed impugn and withstand the certain faith of the
primacie of the Pope. For until after the Council of Basil nothing is read of
it.
Whereupon we may boldly assume, that the now Romish faith, concerning the
Popes Primacie, was not in the current of Antiquity (for the space of 1400
years) accounted Catholic.

8 Here have we singled out the controversy of Papal authority, which is the
pillar and foundation of the Romish Church, lest our Adversaries might think
us too timerously cautelous in our choice, as to insist upon a question less
material: yet have we propounded but one, lest our Christian Reader might
deem us too willingly tedious; whom we therefore ref^rre unto the questions of

showing that our Adversaries can object no text for proof of either, wherein
they are not answered directly from the light of the text, by the express
testimonies of their own Doctors.

9 Neither is there almost any one text in the whole Bible, of Canonical
Scriptures, from Genesis unto the Apocalypse, alleged usually by the Romanists
in the defense of any Article of the Romish profession, which (in an answer
unto the Apologists Contest) we dare not protest to be otherwise expounded,
according unto the sense of Protestants, even by their Romish Adversaries:
which we deliver upon a grounded experience. And if this may be performed, our
Reader must suspect, that the matter is not carried of Protestants by any
miserable begging, but rather of these Romanists by a cunning stealing of the
matter in question. This point by them thus ended, the Apologists seem to
sound up a triumph.

CHAP. XXVII.
THE ROMISH APOLOGY: In the first part of their Conclusion.
Let that man and all other of his mind yet also further consider, that for so
much as the sacred SCRIPTVRES themselves do (as before See heretofore Tract. 1.
Sect. 8. l. n. o. and hereafter Tract. 2. cap. 2. Sect. 1. prope initium.
affirm, that the Churches true Pastors must evermore continue, and withstand
all innovation of false doctine, even with open reprehension: the answerable
performance whereof in particular, being matter of fact, can be to us at this
day, no otherwise made known, then upon the only credit of humane testimony
commended to us by history, M. Whittaker contra Duraeum, lib. 7. page 472.
says, Quicquid de Ecclesiae propagatione, amplitudine, gloria, veteres
Prophetae praedixerunt id perfectum esse historia luculentissime testatur; ita
vaticinijs Pr^phetarum, Ecclesiasticam historiam suffragari nulla controuersia
est.
the force of which testimony our very Aduersa^ies acknowledge; M. ^ooker in
his Ecclesiastical Policy, lib. 2. page 115. initio, says, The strength of
man's authority is affirmatively such, that the weightiest affair^s in the
world depend thereupon. And ibidem page 116. ante medium, Whatsoever we believe
concerning salvation by Christ, although the Scripture be therein the ground of
our belief, yet ^^ man's authority the key that opens the door, etc. The
Scripture could not teach us these things, unless we believed men, etc. And
ibidem lib. 1. page 86. ante medium: Of things necessary, the very chiefest is
to know what b^^kes we are bound to esteem holy, which point is confessed
impossible for the Scripture it self to teach. And lib. 2. Sect. 4. page 1^2.
sine: For if any one book of Scripture did give testimony to all, yet still
that Scripture which gives credit to the rest, would require another Scripture
to give credit unto it: neither could we ever come to any pause whereon to rest
our assurance, unless beside^ Scripture there were something which might
assure us, etc. upon which ground, lib. 3. Sect 8. page 146. fine, he says, We
all know that the first outward motive leading men so to esteem of the
Scripture, is the authority of Gods Church. And Master Whitaker aduersus
Stapletonum, lib 2. cap. 4. page 298. post med. says: Non nego traditionem
Ecclesiasticam esse argumentum quo argui and conuinci possit, qui libri sunt
Canonici, qui non. And ibidem, page 300. ante medium, Hoc semper dixi sensique:
and vide ibidem, l 1. page 25. ante medium. And in his book against M. William
Rainolds, page 44. circa med. Insomuch as the Protestant author of the Treatise
of the Scripture and the Church (so greatly commended by Bullinger in his
preface before that book) does (after the English translation thereof, cap.
15. page 72) say, We could not believe the Gospel, were it not that the Church
taught us, and witnessed, that this doctrine was delivered by the Apostles. And
see further there cap. 19. page 74, and 75.
that therefore the same SCRIPTVRES do therem most evidently perforce reduce
them to this foresaid trial by history and Fathers: whereto if they stand,
their overthrow (they see) is certain: and in refusing the same, their flight
is shameful.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL: In answering unto the first part of the Apologists
Conclusion: First by way of Instance.
SECT. 1.
NO conclusion can have more force in it, than what was contained in the
premises thereof, wherein they have assumed, that all the particulars of the
Romish faith are ancient truths without all innovation in doctrine: and so
proved by the evidences recorded in the books of ancient Fathers, and in the
volumes of old historians. Upon which presumption (we see) they have pronounced
upon Protestants a certain overthrow. But whilst as they are making their
proclamation, behold a cry of their own men of war, panting in despair of
victory, as men guilty unto themselves of manifold Innouations, and
confessing, that there is believed in the Church of Rome (when we unclasped the Sea above lib. 4 cap. 8.. 1.
Tables of Gods covenant) a new 1 Canon of Scriptures of the old Testament, a
new 2 trans^ation, differing from the true Originals; a new 3 restraint of
their public use, belonging unto Christian people of all nations.

2 Next, when we looked up into the pinnacle of their Church, which is See
confessed above, lib. 4. cap. 19.
Popedom it self, therein we spied a new title of an 4 vntuersall Bishop of
the Church; a new approbation of the common name of 5 Pope; and a new
relinquishing of the Popes Christian 6 name; a new order of election of him by
a newly created order of 7 Cardinals; and (which is the worst) a new
transcendent power, both spiritual, which they challenge to be 8 without, 9
above, and 10 against the authority of any Council, or whatsoever power on
earth; and also a new 11 temporal power, whether directly, or indirectly, over
and against the majesty of Kings and Emperors, either for deposing them by
violence, or else for the debasing them to the 12 Kissing of his fe^t; together
with a new claim of 13 Appeals, and of cases, which they call 14 reserved;
besides the new neglect of their principal charge, which is 15 preaching of
the Gospel.

3 From hence we passed along to the examination of their See confessed above
lib. 4. cap. 21. the reason why we note only these three, is, because we speak
not so much as we can prove, but only that which our adversaries have
confessed.
Sacraments, and there we found covered under the name of proper Sacraments, a
new 16 Sacrament of Confirmation, an other of 17 Matrimony, and a third of 18
extreme Unction; besides a new, and preposterous manner of 19 Absolution.

4 Then we walked into their Temple, only to see the order of their solemn
Mass, and See above lib. 4. cap. 22.
^o a new article of faith, called 20 Transubstantiation; a deuisedkind of 21
Elevation, an 22 halfe-communion, a 23 secret muttering of the words of
consecration; a 24 private celebration of the Priest alone; besides the 25 not
breaking of bread out of the loaf; the peoples not taking it with their 26
hands; all new.

5 After this, in passing by their other places, and looking aside, we saw a
new See confessed above lib. 4. cap. 20.
professed order of the 27 Eremites; of 28 Monks; and a rout of Clergy men,
destitute of the gift of contine^cy, and yet constrained to forbear 29 marriage.

6 Forthwith we adjoined our selves unto the pulpit, where we heard the
Preacher instructing their people in new See confessed above lib. 4. cap. 24.
points of doctrine such as is the power of 30 free will, as being equal, yea
and preualent in comparison of grace, in determinating a consent unto good; a
double merit, the Sea above lib. 2 cap. 9. 2.

Jubilees; besides the presumed peremptory judgment in their Popes in the 37
canonization of Saints; and their new doubtful worship l Confessed lib. 4.
cap. 24.
multiplied thereby; together with the doctrines of the blessed Ibide^, number. 8.
Virgins natural conception 38 without sin, and her bodily 39 assumption
into heaven: whereunto might be annexed diverse new and irreligious doctrines
of As that of Incest, contrary unto the law in Leuit. 18. See this proved above
lib. 3. cap. 9.. 3.
Morality; and amongst the rest, we may recount (which hitherto has not been
specified) their new and desperate Vt autem intelligas quam dudum coeperit
inualescere co^mentum istud (speaking of mental Aequiuo ation) Theologoru^

proves it flat lying.
art of flying masked under the name of 40 mental aequiuocation.

7 By and by returning unto their people, as willing to understand their
fashion of worship, we perceived many novelties: as their rattling and reckoning
upon their Confessed above lib. 4. cap. 28.. 1.
newly devised 41 beads; their Lib. 4. cap. 18.. 4. and cap. 27.. 1, 2.
prayer in an 42 unknown tongue; their gazing on the 43 Image of God the Father,
and adoration of the 44 Image of Christ, in many of them idolatrously.

8 Then again considered we their new Lib. 4. cap. 23.. 2.
Missals, greatly 45 superstitious, and partly also blasphemous; and presently
casting our eyes about to behold their other ceremonious professions, we could
not but discern their new See above lib. 4. cap. 25. and cap. 28. etc.
conceits of 46 holy water, of 47 shauing their heads, of 48 baptizing their
belles, besides an 49 importable burden of multudes of fasts, holy days,
habits, and many Jewish and Heathenish varieties; and all these confessed by
learned Romanists. Therefore we may justly retort their weapon upon themselves,

By way of Conclusion.
SECT. 2.
9 When we remember all these particulars (yet have we not repeated all) which
have been proved to be novelties, not by the enforced collections of
Protestants, but from the plain confessions of the Romanists themselves, which
they by the sight of the tract of Antiquity have yielded unto us, and whereof
the Apologists could not be altogether ignorant: our Reader will think them to
have been too preposterously and peremptorily bold, in denouncing against
Protestants, in the trial by history, either a shameful slight, or else a
certain overthrow.

10 How much more vain will they appear in this their vaunt, when we further
call to mind of what sort these are, who must give this great overthrow? For
many of their fellowship, in the same conflict of Antiquity, have been brought
to these straits in answering unto the Fathers, either to profess to See above
lib. 2 cap. 29.. 4.
excuse them by some artificial comment; or secondly, assume an authority to
Ibid.
abolish their writings; or thirdly, by presumption, to say, See above lib. 1.
cap. 5. Sect. 3.
If Gregory were now living, he would judge otherwise; and See above lib. 2
cap. 2. Sect. 27.
If S. Augustine lived at this day, I am persuaded he would not have so said:
or fourthly by detractions to oppose, saying, See above lib. 2 cap. 29. Sect. 2.
We understand many things better than did the Ancients; and Consideratione
dignum est, antiquos Patres pauea de hoc Virginis priuilegio esse locutos. Quod
mirum esse non debet, tum quia Spiritus sanctus paulatim suam Ecclesiam docet
(vt Greg. dicit Hom. 26. in Ezech.) tum etiam quia alijs fidei mysterijs
grauioribus magisque necessarijs explicandis ac defendendis distinebatur.
Postqua^ vero ante 500 annos veritas hae clarius coepit doceri, ita insedit
sidelium animis, creu^^que: paulatim eius si les, vt iam fereomnium con'ensione
receptum sit. Et praesertim abhinc 200 annis ferme omnes Ecclesias^^ei

Sect. 5. page 24. So Salmeron, and others more largely, See above.
more clearly than they before this last 500 years; or else, lastly, by
reiection, concluding thus: See above lib. 2. cap. 29.. 2.
They may not be heard speak, who would reduce all things unto their ancient
course; that which was first is not always best: or thus, See above lib. 4.
cap. 9.. vlt.
We are not bound to follow the Fathers of the primitine Church in all things.
Therefore may they not object shame unto others, until they be first ashamed
of their own behauiours. Now draw we unto land, having but one puttevnto the
shore.

THE ROMISH APOLOGISTS, In the latter part of their Conclusion.
As for the further extremest boldn^sse of such, who are in these straits
(resolved not to acknowledge the Johannes Regius in libro Apologetico, page
192. post medium, and 193. being urged to show wherein the Roman Church
changed her faith, and not able to give any one particular example thereof,
betaketh himself to this extremest boldness, answering page 193. post medium:
Sed denique licet verum esset. Romanam Ecclesiam, in sua religione nihil
mutasse, an propteret, m^ae sequetur eam esse veram Ecclesiam? non opinor. In
de^c^ce whereof he is not ashamed to allege sundry impertinent reasons
unworthy of rehearsal.
Roman Church to be a true Church, though it were true, that she had not
changed any thing in religion,) we pass the same over as being most absurd,
and much more worthy of contempt then answer.

THE PROTESTANTS APPEAL.
SECT. 3.
11 A Jesuit in this question, Ob. In Romana Ecclesia ab Apostolorum
temporibus nunquam in ^llo sidei a^ticulo v^riatam doctrinam inuem^i* ^ectene
concludam eandem nunc esse, quae tuit Apostolorum? Si assumptione^ negaueris,
interrogabo te in quibus sidei atticulis mutata sit? quando? qua ocasione? He
answers:
Whether the Church of Rome may be thought to hold the same doctrine with the
Apostles, if it have not altered any article since the Apostles times, did
imply this Enthymeme; The Church of Rome has not alte^ed any article of faith
since the Apostles times: Ergo, the now faith of the Church of Rome is the same
with that which was taught by the Apostles. Our Protestant Author Regius
answered unto the Antecedent, calling it At Platina, and historici vestri alij
obseruarunt, quid in Missa quisque Pontisicum vestrorum addiderit.
Centuriatores in singulis Centurijs quomodo religio in singulis capitibus
controuersis mutara sit, ex vestris authotibus demonstrant -- Accedant Tomi

Decreta, and Decretalia, q^i^us vnus Papa altetius dicta and facta damnauit: --

est dissentio illa non leuicula, sed in loco de Iustificatione. Then follows
that in the Apologists, Sed denique -- unto -- Nam -- Christus in regno

Similiter annon Ariani, and alijhaeretici inter se quoque consentiunt a prima

most false,) and for proof that the Church of Rome has varied from it self,
as it was in the primitive Churches, he appealeth unto ancient Historians, unto
the public Tomes of Councels, unto the Decretals of Popes, and unto the
experience of their common dissensions among themselves. Here is sea-roome
enough, which the Apologists have called straits.

12 Next he answers unto the Ergo or Consequence, calling it infirm, because
the Arians and also other Heretics held a consent among themselves from the
first beginning of their heresies. Which is undoubtedly true in diverse
heretics, who lived in the Apostles times, such as See August. Tom. 6. lib. de
haeresibus.
were the Simonians, Basilidians, Nicolaitans; who, albeit they lived in the
days of the Apostles, yet did they not profess the doctrine of the Apostles.
Which sufficiently demonstrateth the insi^mitie of the consequence, wherein the
Jesuit confounded time with truth; and consequently Both which were sown about
the same time: only the Wheat in the day, and the Tares in the night. Matthew.
13
tares with wheat. How then could the Apologists in reason call his answer
absurd?

13 But as the Apologists in the beginning, when they endeavored to demonstrate
the union of the now Roman faith, by the faith of S. Gregory, throughout every
particular, omitted the mention of many particulars, wherein S. Gregory was an
Adversary unto their now faith: so now in the end and shutting up of their
Treatise (when they would brand a Protestant Author with the make of exigence
through straits, and of absurdity) by their willing concealment of his
reasons, they do, in effect, tell us, that their meaning was to make their end
suitable and proportionable unto the beginning. Nevertheless that they may
further know how little cause the Protestants have to fear straits, we add

CHAP. XXVIII. The Conclusion of the Protestants Appeal, divided into two
parts: the first demonstrating what heresies now harbor among the Romanists.
SECT. 1.
NEarenesse unto an heresy may be in a greater and less degree; the less we
may call alliance, the other consanguinitte. Concerning the less degree of
proximitie, let our Adversaries expostulate with their own consciences about
those heretics, whom they have paralleled with the Protestants: and compare
their Friars, who profess a course of begging, with the Adue^sus ignauous
Monachos, qui tum in Africa errorem hunc a -- Messalianis enatum fouebant,
Augustinus seripsit librum de opere Monachorum, quo tria potissimum demonstrat:
primum vt Monachi, qui nullo Euangelico negotio, nulla cura Ecclesiastica

Senensis Bill. l. ^. annot. 317.. Verum nc.
Messaltani, who defended idleness, and were therefore condemned by S.
Augustine, concluding that they ought to labor with their own hands: and
their See above c. 18.. 1. 2.

Peputians, who yielded unto women Ecclesiastical functions: and some of their
people, whose most common books are pictures, among which is the Image of God,
in the form of an old man, with the Sea above ca. 8. Sect. 2.
Anthropomorphitae, who taught that God consists of a bodily substance,
according to the shape of a man: and their Merit-mongers, either in the opinion
of their inherent righteousness, with the Sea above cap. 14.. 3.
Catharists, who thought themselves pure; or in the presumption of their
deserving grace, with the Sea ibid cap. 12.. 4. and l 2. c. 10.. 7. where some
Romanists condemn others of Pelagianisine.
Pelagians, who believe that works done without grace do merit the grace of
God: and their I^suites defending the Sea above lib. 2. cap. 2. Sect. 18.

Aquinas, infers a possibility of omni presence, with the Ibidem.
Eutychians, who maintained the vbiquitie of the humane nature: and all of
them, holding that the Church Catholic cannot be separated from the Sea of
Rome, with the Sea above cap. 14. sect. 4.
Donatists, who imagined that the Catholic Church was inseparably confined to
one place of the world, namely Afric: This done, let them tell us, whether
they have not (we say not an absolute, but yet) a greater affinity with these
foresaid heretics, than have the Protestants, whom they have traduced in the
names of the foresaid heretics. From alliance we pass to one degree of
consanguinitie.

A greater Accordance, which the same particular Romanists may seem to have
with the heretics of former times.
SECT. 2.

Romanists censured the Greek text of Scripture to be depraved and corrupted
with many dangerous heresies, lest we should make it a warrantable direction of
our doctrines: which is confessed to have been the error of Heluidius quoq^e

falsata affirmauit, vt D Hieron. in lib. quem aduersus illu^ conscripsit,

of faith, was the same which we have now in use.

Anabaptists, who (as is acknowledged) say that the Scriptures are written but
in dead letters, and thereupon refuse to be tried by them? Some have taught
that kind of implicit belief in the necessary principles of faith, which,
for the stupiditie thereof, has deserved to be called the Colliers faith,
which is thus described by their own Bishop: Nec enim de fidei subtilitatibus
exammandi sunt simplices, nisi cum suspicio est, eorum s^mplicitatem ab
haereticis deprauatam esse: in ijs autem, quae fider per se sunt obiecta. per

The Collier being demanded what he believed, answered, That which the Church
believes; and being asked, What the Church believed, answered, That which I
believe. Of which kind of faith the same Bishop complains, as of a doctrine
too much commended in their Church: which S. Hierome seems to have condemned
in the Luciferians, telling them, that At dicis, simpliciter in Patre, and
Filio, and Spir sancto credidit and ideo baptisma consecutus est. Quae est
ista, quae^o sin plicitas, nescire quod creda^? simplicite^ credidit, quod

supreme Judge of the exposition of Scriptures must be the Pope: whom, in these
three considerations, we may call the Epitome and sum of the Roman faith,
especially seeing that their Romanists glory to have their denomination of A
Papa Papistas dici nec veten ut, nec erubesc^^^^. ^^rinus Ies. com in. Act. 20.
30.
Papists from the Pope, as though in him their faith were fully incorporate.
For this cause we desire them to use a little phlebotomie, and to search what
is the manifold corruption, which lies only within this head-article of their
profession. First, S. Gregory has given the title of universal Bishop the
eare-marke of See about lib. 1. c. 2. Sect. 29.
blasph^mous impietic.

7 Secondly, their advancing of a Pope above the authority of a Council, the
Council of Basil condemned for a See above lib 4. cap. 2. Sect. 3.
Inua^esce^et praeterea ille permciosissimus error in populum Dei, vt vnus homo

pernicious heresy.

8 Thirdly, their adding unto this transcendent authority an infallibility of
judgment, Index generalis, legitimus, or dinarius omnium controuersiarum,
quaecunque possunt o^ri in negotio religionis, est Pontifex Rom sieve losus
desiniat aliquid, sieve defimat cum Concilio generali ^ste ^udex temper and

sieve is vna cum Episcoporum Concilio, sieve alisque Concilio ^^s fidei definire
velit. Greg^r de Valent. Analys. lib. 5. cap. 2. and cap. 3.
as alone without any Council to define any point of faith, without
possibility of erring; which sounds much after that heresy of them, who
Omnes enim sectatores ^ius Basilicas Apostolorum and Martyrum non ingrediu^tur,
vt scil. mortuum adorent Eunomium, cuius libros maio^is authoritatis
arbitrant^r quam Euangelia: and in ipso credunt esse lumen veritatis, sicut
aliae haereses paracletum in Montanum venisse contendunt, and Manichaeum ipsum
dicunt esse paracletum. Hieronym. Tom. 2. lib. aduersus Vigilant. page 123.
thought that in Eunomius there rested the Spirit of truth, as other he^etiked
did believe an vn-trring paraclet in Montanus, as S. Hierome observes. The
Ab^ssus of this kind of heresy has been sounded by S. Gregory, saying; See
above lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 30.
If the universal Bishop (speaking generally) shall err, then the whole
Church must err with him: Or as the Council of Basil more personally, Non est
Papa mayor tota Ecclesia: alioqui errante Pontifice, sicut si pe contingit,
tota Ecclesia erraret. Council. Basil. apud Surium, Tom. 4. page 145. col. 1.
The Pope erring (as ostentimes it has happened) the whole Church must jointly
fall. Can there be a greater mystery of iniquity, than to resolve our faith
upon that judgment as infallibly true, which may be (because he As has been
proved by many examples of h^reticall Popes. See above in this book cap. 24.
has been) a lying Oracle?

9 Fourthly, they yield unto this their Judge a further security, which is
undoubtedly to Sui ducem Authors illi volunt Pontificem in rebus alioqui
omnino controuersis, hoc est, non satis express in Ecclesia compertis ac
determinatis, desinire posse vt personam publicam errorem reipsa contra fidem:
errant ips^^ fide grauissime, posset enim imo tene^etur tunc Ecclesia vniuersa
Pontisicem de re controue^la docentem, ac nondum haeresi manifesta notatum, pro
Pastore suo agnoscere, atque id^o ipsum omnino audire. Ita sieret, vt si tune
ille errare posset, Ecclesia etiam vntuersa posset, imo teneretur errare, quae
est haeresis intolerabilis, vt supra disputatum est. Valent. Ies. Anaelys. lib.

judge the truth, although he use no diligence to know it: which all know to be
an Anabaptisticall Enthysiasmus, for the fect of the Anabaptists permits the
ordinary Pastor to ^elie upon an extraordinary inspiration.

10 Fifthly, they extend his power of Judicature to the canonizing of new
articles of faith, as to believe, (and that upon their Profiteor quoque septem
esse vere and proprie Sacramenta nouae legis a Jesus Christo Domino nostro
instituta -- quam conuersionem Catholica Ecclesia Transubstantiatione^

Papal Indulgences, and diverse other the like points, which by some of our
Roman See above in the diverse particulars.
Adversaries have been denied to contain in them any Catholic or universal
truth. Against this kind of heresy their own Bishop has given a true rule,
to wit, Memineris regulae istius, cum scil. qui credit aliquid esse de fide.
non recte de fide sentire: nam sicnt non licet quicquam fidei subduc^re, aut
negare esse de fide, quod de fide est, ita nec licet quicqitam sid ^addere,
quod de fide n^n est Archiepiscopus Caesari^nsis lib. vary Tract epist ad
lectorem.
As we may not deny any thing to be of faith, which is of faith, so may we not
add any article unto the faith, which is not of faith.

11 Sixthly, they enlarge this hand of his spiritual jurisdiction to the
disposing of all temporal dominions; which has been proved from consessed
principles to be an See above, lib. 2 cat. (...).
Antichristian tyranny.

12 And lastly, the perpetuity of this indivisible head of the Church, they
tie unseparably unto the person of the Bishop of Rome, and his seat; which is
a part of See above, cap. 14. sect, 14.
Donatisme.

13 Now then, if, according to the Physicians Theoreme, caput malum est caput
malorum, that is, an evil head is the head of evils; what can more concern
Christendom, than to crush a little this so dangerous and head, that both
Scriptures, Fathers, general Councels, and the whole Church of Christ may
obtain their ancient freedom from the Sea above lib. 1. cap. 3. etc.

Aduersaties, yet only desire that they would hold (as S. Chrysostom teaches,
(...), that is, every novelty a vanity; and in all controversies suffer the
first-bo^ne to find a preeminence, by preferring each doctrine according unto
the prime antiquity.

15 This our Adversaries also have pretended, but their prejudice is made
evident in their vain claim unto the faith of S. Gregory, and others, of

ancient tradition of the primitive Church, (as the Protestants are confessed
to profess:) and the other, and most principal, is the evidence of holy
Scripture, which (even by the confession of their Jesuit Acosta) Inter externa

will be unto the Christians the chiefest external bulwark of defense,
against the assaults of Antichrist. And being thus fortified, we are persuaded
that their Pope Paulu^ quartus might with as good conscience have offered to
allow of the doctrine of our English Church, as he Qu^d ^rgo? Eam, quae iam

did of our Service and Liturgy.

17 From all these so many and weighty premises, we are moved in our
Conclusion to answer the Apologists contempt with a commiseration and prayer,
beseeching God, for his Christ's sake, that all we, who invoke upon that
glorious, and only saving name of Jesus, may be inspired with one Spirit of
truth and charity, the bond of all perfection. Amen.

I have further been advertised, concerning the alleged Jewish Authors and
authorities,

1. that [Ioseph Bengorion] making mention of ^ranci, and of the town Amboise
(which were not heard of until almost 400 years after Christ) could not be one
of the old Rabbis.

2. That [R. Simean] author of the Zoar, col. 243. makes mention of Targum
Onk^l^s, and of ^^rathan sin of Vziel (which were the Cha^die Paraphrasis)
the f^^mer of them living (as Posseuine and others con^esse) an hundred years
after Christ. And is he to be numbered before Christ? Besides, the testimony it
self, which is egregiously depraved by C^ccius, (of whom the testimony is
bo^rowed) by adding, [V^i a pec^atorum ^ordibus purgatisunt] of his own. As he
does in the next testimony of Kimchi upon the Psalm. 31. put in, Purgatorium,
which is the only word which can make for his purpose. But truly in those
Ra^bins, which I have looked into, as Shel^m^th, Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Bengorion,
with Commentaries upon the Bible, I never found any prayer for the dead, but
rather an hopeful omination of their blessed state.
