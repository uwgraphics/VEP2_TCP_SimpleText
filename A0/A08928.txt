Thy storye of the right noble and worthy knight paris and of the fair vyenne
the dolphyns daughter of vyennoys.

Here begins thystorie of the noble right vaylliau^t and worthy knight Paris
/ and of the fair Vye^ne the daulphyns daughter of vie^nois: the which suffered
many aduersitees / because of their true love. or they could enyoye the effect
thereof each of other
IN the time of king Charles of France the year of our lord Ihesu crist M.
CC. lxxi. was in the land of vye^nois a rich Baron daulphyn and lord of the
land that was named sir Godefroy of alanson / and was of the kings kynrede of
France. the which daulphyn was right mighty and a great lord both in hauoyr
and in lands. and was a right wise man / in so much that for his great
wysedom he was much made of: both of the king of france. and of all the
lords and barons of his court / so that no thing was done in the said
royame but that he was called thereto / And had to his wife a much fair lady
which cleped was dame Diane: which was of so great beauty that she was well
worthy and digne to be named after that fair sterre that me^ call dyane that
appyreth and shows a lytyl before the day / and also she was replenisshed of
all noblenes and ge^tilnes that a lady may or ought to have The said daulphin
then^e and this noble lady dyane were vij. year to gyder without issue that
much they desired to have and prayed our lord both night and day that they
might have children playsaunt and ready to his deuyne service: and out lord
thorugh his benignite herd their prayer: and after his plaisir gaf unto the^
the viij. year of their marriage a right fair daughter for the which great
gladness and yoye was made through all the daulphins land: and the child was
baptized with great honor and joy / and in token of great love they named her
vye^ne because the cite where she was born^ in was called vye^ne. and this
daughter was delivered unto anoble lady for to be norisshed with her: The
which lady was of the said cite / and had a lytill daughter of the agae of
vye^ne. the which was named Ysabel / and so the fair vye^ne was nourysshed wit
the same ysabel. from her tender age unto many years after and so great love
was between them both that they called each other systers and the fair vienne
grew and e^creaced ever in souerayn beauty and gentylnesse. so that the
reno^mee of her excellent beauty flourysshed not only through al france but
also through all the Royaume of england and other countries It happed after she
was. xv. year of aage. that she was desired to marriage of many knights and
great lords / and at that time was in the daulphyns court among many his
knights / a noble man of ancient lygnage and of fayrlondes / the which was
well byleued of the daulphin and of all the lords of the lord. and was called
sir Jakes: This noble man had a much fair sone that had to name Paris / and his
fader made him to be taught i^ al good customs / and wha^ he was xviij year of
aage he was adressed to the dysciplyne of arms. and demened him self so nobly
and worthily in all manner deeds of cheualerie that wit in a short time after he
was doubed knight by the hand of the said Daulphyn: No fayte of knyghthode ne
none adventure of cheualrye happed after / But that he found him self at it in
so much that the reno^mee of hi^ ran through all the world. and men said that
he was one of the best knights that might be found in any country / and
held him self right clean in arms: and lived chastely and joyefully. and had
ever about him fowls hawks and hounds for his disporte for all manner of
hunting suffysaunt enough for a duc or for an earl. and through his prowess and
hardynes he was acqueynted and known of many other great lords / And among
all other he was gretely and louyngli acgueynted with a yo^ge knight of the
Lyte of Vye^ne that hight Edward. and were both of one age / and much loved
each other / and as two brethren of arms went ever to gyder there as they
knew any ioustyng or appertyse of arms to be had for to get honor. And wete
it well that beside their worthynes i^ arms they were good musycyens playe^g
upon all manner instruments of musyke / and could sing very well. but pares
passed in all points his felawe Edward Notwythstondyng Edward was amerous
already of a noble lady of the court of braban. But paris as yet knew naught
of amorouste: but not long after Venus the gods of love fyred his thought
wit the heart unto a noble young lady / that is to wete the fair vye^ne the
daulphyns daughter of Vyennoys. that was his lyege lord. and the more be growed
toward his flouryng aage the more he was esprysed and brennyng of her love for
the great beauty that was in her. but paris thought ever in his heart that his
love was not wellykline cordable. For he was not of so high lygnage as the
noble mayde^ vie^ne was of and therefore paris kept his love secret that none
should perceive if / sauf Edward his trusty felawe to whom he brake and showed
his counceyl / And the fair vyenne perceived not that paris was amerous of her
Nor paris also durst neither show nor say nothing to her of hit. but the more
that he saw her. the more grew the fire of love within him self.

How paris and Edward his felawe played wit diverse instruments by night to fore
the chamber of vye^ne
Paris then and edward with one accord dysposed the^ self for to give sum
melodyous myrthe to the noble maid Vyenne and with their muyscall instruments
/ as recourders: They yede by night tym^ to gyder toward that perte of (...)
castle / where as the fair vye^ne (...) in her chamber. and there they (...)
full swetely and sowned (...) ^^ously their muyscal instrumen^ (...) pypes. and
certain the melodye of songs. and the sown of their (...) (...) in his castle
of vyenne. And When they were all come they played and sange in their best
wise: but among them were not found tho mynstrelles that the lord Daulphyn
sought fore. Whereof he was soroufull and desired more to know what they were
than he did a fore. And wha^ the fair vye^ne herd all the mynstrellys of the
land that sowned at the feste. she said to Ysabel her damoysell and preuy
fellow. By my faith sweet sister / these mynstrelles playen naught to the
regard of the^ that were wont to come before our chamber and me displayseth
much that I may not know we the^: For certainly they come not hither for
naught. for they love outher you or me.

How the Lord Daulphyn sent x. harneysed men to take Paris and Edword / there
as the pleyden upon their instruments before the chamber of Dyenne.
When the Daulphin understood his daughters words he wylling to plaise her
said unto her that if it were possible: she should know what they were that
so sa^ge every night before her chamber Wherefore he ordained. x. men^ of
arms: and commanded them to hyde them self pryuely there as the sown was
herd / and that they should bring to him other by force or other wise the^
that made that sweet melodye / Now came the night that the two ynge knights
Paris and Edward that nothi^ge knew of thembusshement that was laid: for them
came with their instruments toward the castle and there they began to singe
and sowned their instruments so melodiously that great plaisir it was to here
/ and when they had song and would have returned thither as they were come fro
The. x. knights lepte and camforth and salewed them curtoysii / saying that
they needs come must with them for to speak wit their lord the daulphyn /
Then^e said Paris to them. Fair lords abide a little while. if yt playse you
and of us ye shall have an answer Then went Paris and edward a part and
spoke to gyder. ye see fair brother said paris to Edward in what party we be
now and I would not that ye should have by me any displaisir nor harm. but so
mche i tell you that or I should suffer me to be led to fore the daulphyn I
had lever deye / therefore fair brother advise we what is best for to do / and
edward heryng paris words said / Brother mine have no fere of no thing and
let us do as ye will Then^ said they to the. x. men of arms lords through
your curtosye suffer us to return thither as we came fro / for we be at my lord
the daulphins playsir and of all the lords and barons of his court but in
any manner as for this time we may not fulfylle his commandment.

How paris and Edward his felawe foughten against. x. harneysed men: that would
have taken thaym.
When the said / x. men of arms saw the two knights dysobeyssaunt / they
a^swerd to them / ye shall now come to him other with your will or by force /
and began to pulle onte their swerdes and came against the two yoge knights
that naked were from all arms sauf their swerdes and their bowclers. Wherwyth
they couerd them: and so manfully deffe^ded their bodies that they hurt and
wounded fore all the ten armed men^ / i^ so much that they maad them all to
void and flee fro the place whether they would or not and on the morrow erly
the ten men of arms came to fore the daulphyn all wounded and fore hurt / And
they reco^pted to him how two young men only had arrayed them so and how they
needs must flee for fere of their lives. Whereof the daulphi was right angry to
see the^ so sore hurt and took great displaysir of it. and thought well that the
said two yo^ge knights were of great stre^gthe and virtue: wherefore he ^ma^ded
an ho^dred men to be ready for to espy and take the^ the night following if they
came ageyn chargyng that none hurt should be doo^ to the^: but after their
song done they should be brought unto him. but this e^terpryse came to none
effect. for the two young knights came not ageyn but kept all that they had
done secret / Wha^ the fair vie^ne saw that she might not know we what these
mistrellys were: she thought that they were sum great lords that were
anterous of her: and she and her damoisely ysabel spoke of none other thing
than of these mynstrelles and had great plaisir to talk of them: Paris seeing
he durst not say nor show the great love that he had to the fair vyenne /
thought he would hyde his courage from her / wherefore he took acqueyntau^ce with
the bishop of saint Laure^ce. the which learned him holy scripture. The
daulphyn the^ue seeing his daughter full tryste and pensyful for this that she
might not know the said mynstrelles that so melodyoussy played to fore her
chamber. he ordained a joustyng place with i^ his cite of vie^ne / and made
lystes and scaffoldes to be set up / and sent his herauldes in france in
England and in norma^dye to anou^ce and show unto all knights and gentilme^
that would do faites of arms and of cheualrye for lone of all ladies and
damoyselles / that the joustes should be holde^ the first day of may / in the
cite of vyenne. And he that should do best i^ arms. should have of the daulphis
daughter a sheld of cristall of great valeur / and a garlo^d wit roses and
flowers of fyn gold. and were ye well that vye^ne the noble and fair madye^
was right glad of the youstes that her fader ordained for her sake For great
tale^t and desire she had to know hi^ that was so amerous of her. and she
thought he would be at the said first day of may at vienne After the messagers
that had pronounced the youstes were come^ ageyn to the cite of vienne / the
most part of the knights and gentylme^ of the Royaume of France of England
and of normandy made the^ ready for to come to the Lyte of Dyenne to the said
joustes / And in especyal many noble baron^s of the royaume of England and of
france that amerous were of the fair vyenne of the reno^mee of sjyr great
beauty. came to the said youstes with rich and noble array. among whom was
Johan duc of bourbon. nevew to the king of france / Edward the kings sone of
England a^tony sone to the sone to therle of prouc^ce. Gerard the marquys sone
of mou^tferat: and wyllya^ sone to the duc of Larnes: Paris then^ knowi^g this
noble assemble and ^he ioustes that should be the first day of may thought i^
he^self whether he should goo thither or not / but the great love that he had to
the fair vienne constrained hi^ thereto. Nevertheless he took cou^ceyl of Edward
his felawe. the which answered to him / if ye goo I will hold you company
thither. but we must depart secretly / that we be not known And anon they
made ready their harn^yg / and pourueyed their of good horses which they
harneysed al i^ whyt / and none other toke^ they had on the^ where hithei might
be known sauf that they were araied al i^ whit / and one like (...) other. the
day of the youstes then^e approached and all the lords and barons before said
ca^ two days before the feste to the Cite of vye^ne where the daulphyn for
love of them did do make a noble scaffold where as the fair vyenne was
rychely arrayed. and all that saw her were a meruailled of her great / beauty /
To that feste came many knights and squyers clothed and arrayed rychely after
the guyse of their country / and there were many mynstrellys playeng upon all
manner instruments: and many good syngars which the noble maid vyene herkened
full well. For her heart was only set to think how she might know him that
was her lover / paris came then thither and was ordained for to serve at the
daulphins table where Vyenne satte / and wete ye well that full gracyously and
curioysly he served and kerued before her.

How Paris gate the prys of the youstes in the cite of Vye^ne
WHa^ the day was come^ that the lords knights and ge^tyl men should iouste
for love of the ladies / Paris and Edward yede to a secret place where they
armed them secretly: and syn came to the lystes with their badges and tokens /
and were horsed and armed full rychely and well. All other knights there were
known by their arms but the two whyt knights were unknown: The daulphyn
then^e commanded that every one should mustre or the ioustyng began along the
field tofore the ladies and damoyselles: and so they mostred rydyng to fore
the scaffold of the fair vye^ne. and were so nobly and rychely armed and
arrayed: and so godely men they were that every one said / the f^oure of
knighthode may now be see^ in this place / Among al other princes edward of
England was most amerous of al and right renommed in arms The pucelle vyenne
seeing all these noble knights. said to her damoisel ysabel / Fair sister
which of them al think you that most does for the love of me / and ysabel
answered / honorable lady: me seems he that bears the lion of gold in his
arms / does more for your love tha^ the other Certes said vyenne yonder two
whit knights that bear non^ arms i^ their sheldes are more to my fantasye /
tha^ any of the other always / we shall see now what they can do Then^e were
the knights ready to do fayte of arms And first an hardy and vailliau^t knight
that bare i^ his arms a crown of gold bygan the first course / and against him
ra^ne the good knight edward paris felawe: and recou^tred each other so
vygorously that they brake both their speres. many other met each other
sodaynlye gyuyng great strokes. sum were ouertrhowen to the earth and some
brake their speres worthily and kept their sterops right vaylly au^tly / the
other recountred each other so manifully that both horse and man were cast to
the ground. For every man did his best to get worship there. Edward the
kings sone of England bare him full well and had the better upon many a knight
there / But the strong knight paris broched his horse toward him / and met him
so vygorously that at the end he ouerthrewe him and had the better of him
Whereof he gate great worship and was much praised for his great prowess /
This youstyng lasted till souper time / and when the even came many of the^ were
weary of the ioustes and rested the^ / but paris did then more of arms
showing his meruayllous prowess than he had done of all that day / in somoche
that non^ durst approach him ne withsto^de his appertyse in arms. and so much
he did that thonour and prys of the joustes rested and abode in him that day.

How the shede of cristal and the garlond with flowers of gold were yeuen to
Paris. As to the best doer in faytes of arms
THe feste ended: great whorshyp and loenge abode to the two knights wit the
whit arms: And Paris was led unto the scaffold / there as vyenne was the
which delyuerd him the sheld of crystal and the garlond wit f^oures of gold /
that she held in her ho^de And then^e paris with Edward his felawe departed
thens in the secretest wise that they could and went to unarm them to the
place where they first armed them self / The barons and knights that were
there spoke well of the prowess and of cheualrye of the knights wit the whyt
arms. so that the daulphyn and the other great lords had great desire to
know what they were and to have their acqueyntau^ce / but they deperted so
secretli fro the field that no man knew where they were become / nor what way
they took.

After all this was thus done / the knights returned into their countrees
spekyng ever of the ryall feste / and chere that the daulphin haddoon to the^ /
and of the prowess of the whyt knights / and of the right souerayn beauty and
noblesse of vyenne: and in the mean while there moened a stryf betwyxte the
baron^s and knights of France and of england. for so^me were there that were
amerous of the daughter of the duc of Norma^die / and so^me were that loved and
bare out the beauty of the sister of the king of England. saying she was
fayrer then^e vye^ne was / and other were there that held contrary oppynyo^
saying that the Daulphyn^ daughter vye^ne passed in beauty al other wymme^ in
the world: and for this reason was great debate and stryf betwyxte the
knights of france and the^ of englod for the beauty of these three damoiselles.

Ever multyplyed and grew more the br^yt and the reno^me of the daulphi^
because of the youstes and tournement done in his cite of vye^ne / whereof he
had great joy / for they had be somoche honorable and plaisau^t to al
knights. And vie^ne ever thought in her self who might he be that had gotten
the worship and prys of the ioustes and said to ysabel / Never trust me dear
sister but the knight to who^ i have yeue^ the sheld of crystal and my garlo^d
is he that so swetely sa^ge for the love of me to foreour chamber. for mine heart
gives it me / and by my faith sister he is full noble and worthy / and in all
his deeds right curtois and ge^til as we might have see^ whylere wherefore i say
iou my sweet sister that in hi^ i have put the rote of mine entyere heart: my
will and al my love: nor never i shall have plaisir ne joy unto the time that
i know what he is / for my love is al his. and of what so ever estate he be
of I never shall take mine heart fro hi^. Then^e began she to wayle and fight
for the love of him full tender li. for till now she had not felt the sparkles
of love that spra^ge out of her heart. but paris knew nothing her of that she
desird to have him and to know what he was But he kept his love secret in
his heart / For he durst not show it unto her: wherefore he led his life i^
great tristesse and sorrow he went ever in the felawship of the bishop of
saint laure^ce: and made semblau^ce of nothing / and james the fader of paris
that had see^ the noble feast and the ryall ioustes i^ the cite / wenyng to hi^
that his sone paris had not ben there was full sorry: and had great displaysir
of it and said. fair sone paris i am in a great male^colye and in a thought for
you that ye be not so yoeful ne merry as ye were wont to be. here a fore time i
saw you ever ready to the ioustes and to all manner faytes of chyualerye for to
get honor. and I now see you al changed syn ye took acqueyntau^ce with this
bishop / for loathe I were to see you bycome a man of relygyon as I fere he
will bring you to / and right wroth i am that ye were not at that noble and
ryall tournoyment that has be holden in vyenne for the sake of all the ladies
of this lord. wherefore dear sone i pray you to take heed to your self that ye
lose not your good renommee. your worship ne the praysyng alsoo that ye have
getyn and wounne before time. And that ye spend not your yongthe in ydelnesse
And paris heering all this answered no thing to his fader but abode stylle
pensyfull thynking on the great beauty of vyenne

Now says thistorye that as ye have herd above a great stryf befyll among the
knights before said for the love of the iij. damoiselles a fore said For the
earls sone of flaundres was gretely wroth for this cause wit the duc of
breuuez: and had beten and hurt sore each other so that non might make the pees
betwixt them For either of them mayntened and bare out the beauty of his
lady: It happed then^e that five knights hardi and valyaunte came forth the
which said that they were ready to fight and for to prove by force of arms
that florye the dukes donghter of norma^dye was the fairest damoisolle of all
the world / And incontinent stert up five other knights that said and
mayntened that Co^stau^ce the kings sister of Englod was the fairest / And
fortwith other^. knights rose up that mayntened and vphelde the beauty of
vyenne above all other wymmen i^ the world i^ somoche that this debate came to
the knowleche of the king of France which said that hereof might grow a great
trouble and discord among his baron^s and other lords So sent he word to
them that they should come toward him. and that he should give such a se^te^ce
upon their stryf / that they al should be thereof co^tente. the which message
plesed the^ well and came all toward him as soon as they might And when they
were come to fore the king they spoke of their stryf / But anon the king
ordained a ioustes for the love of the said three ladies / and made his
mau^deme^t that they al should come wit their arms and horse for to iouste the
viij. day of septe^bre in the Cite of parijs. and they that should do best in
arms at the day they should have the prys and th worship of the feste and the
lady: on whose beauty they held which should be reputed and holde^ for the
fairest damoisel of all the world / The king of France then^e sent word to
the fads of the foresaid three ladies prayeng them to come at the same feste. and
that either of them should bring wit him a p^sent of richesse the which the
presents should be yeue^ in the worship of their three daughters: to the best
doer in arms in toke^ of victory And thus the king of England first sent for
his sister Co^staunce a fair crown of gold all set with perlys and
precious stones of great valeur / The duc of Normandye for love of his daughter
Florye sent a right fair garlond set wit diverse perlys and p^cious stones
much rich and of great extimacion And the daulphyn for love of his donghter
vye^ne sent a much rich coler of gold all enuyronned with precious stones of
diverse colors / the which was worth a right great tresour. and these three
Iewelles were delivered to the king of France / The foresaid knygtes then^e
made the^ ready and apparaylled all things according to the ioustes. and in
rich array came al to the cite of parijs / And wete ye well that in France
was not seen before that day so great noblesse of barons and knights as were
there assembled / for there were the most hye princes and barons of England of
France and of Norma^dye and either of them did set all his wit and
entendement to uphold and bear out that they had purposed and said. and every
baron gaf his lyuery that they should be known each fro other. and the brnyt
and renomme was that my lady Constan^ce should have thonour of that feste for
this that many a fair and hardy knight made them ready to mayntene the quarelle
of her beauty / but nevertheless either of these three parties hoped to have the
worship of the feste: and paris that was in vye^ne the cite: and that well knew
the great apparaylle of this feste took counceylle of Edward his felawe.
Whether he should goo to parijs or not / And Edward counceylled him to goo
thither. so that he went secretly. and said if ye goo thither secretly and if
god give you grace that ye get the worship of the feste / great well and good
shall come to you thereby. and if ye goo and be known the daulphyn and the other
lords shall not preyse you so much as they should if ye were unknown for
cause that ye be not of so great lygnage as they be. an other is if ye goo
openly and that my lady vienne happeth to have thonour of the feste by your
prowess. she shall naught be set by / considering the other great lords that
shall be there proceeding your degree / and if she get the worship of the feste
by a knight unknown the love and honor shall grow the more i^ her courage
toward him that thus has done for her sake. Wherefore I cou^ceyl you to goo
thither in the most secretest wise that ye may / For my trust is that ye shall
get great worship there: and but if ye goo / trust me I shall make my self
ready to god thither for you / For i will be loathe to see the beauty of my lady
vye^ne to be rebuked. At these words granted paris to goo to the said
ioustes. and wha^ he was ready and had all things according to a noble knight.
he deperted i^ the seccretest manner that he might toward the cite of parijs /
where as the king of france maad great prouysion of all manner metes and of all
other things necessary to such a ryal feste / and in the mids of the cite
of parijs he ordained the place where the knights should iouste and did do
make many fair scaffoldes for the ladies and damoiselles to be set on / for
to behold the youstyng. Also he did do make three baners full fair and rych The
first baner was whyt: and there was wryto^ upon hit in letters so gold Vye^ne
daughter to my lord god froy of ale^son. daulphyn of vye^noys The second baner
was read. and was writo^ thereon in letteres of gold Constaunce the kings
sister of england The third baner was whyt and in letteres of gold was wryton
thereon Florye daughter to the duc of normandye: and these. iij. baners were
pyght up at iij. corns of the field. and wete ye that so great prees was there
that the people took their place upon the scaffoldes two days before the feste
for to see the great people and the fair ordinance that there was

Wha^ it was so: that the lords were ready of all things that were necessary
/ and were deperted fro their countrees they assembled al at parijs the xiiij.
day of septembre. and never tofore was seen so great a company of nobles For
fro all parties was comen great cheualerye. the sum for to do arms: and the
other for to see the feste / which was much su^ptuous and noble / and when
the day assygned came of the Ioustes / On the morning erly he did do set
these three yoyaulx or yewels i^ the baners the which shone and resple^disshed
much meruayllously for the nombre of perles and precyons stones that were in
the baners. Now it should be ouerlonge to recyte of the barons and of the
knights that were in that iourneye: For many were comen thither fro the Royaume
of spaigne of aragon and of many other countries for to prove their strength /
and persons. and for to mayntene the baron^s that mayntened the three ladies
maidens Of whom we shall reherce of the pryncypallest here after the shortest
wise we may And when it came in the morning that every man was / armed and
apparaylled in. the field / and that the king of france was set in his great
scaffolde / and began to say al alowde and much meruaillous^y / that all the
people might here and understand. Knights and barons that been here for to do
the fayte of arms goo ye every che under that baner that he will mayntene for
the love of his lady / and we give in commandment that this field be of love
and of courtosye. as it to you apperteyneth / how be it we will well that each of
you do vaylyauntly his arms and his chyualryes for that damoisell which he
will mayntene: and he that shall win the field shall have the prys and thonour
of the feste / and that lady or damoisel shall be maintend and allowed for the
most fayred damoysele of the world. and shall have the prys and thonour of the^
of England of France and of norma^dye And that to this no man be so hardy to
gaynsay upon the pain to lose his life And yet after this he said ye, see here
a fair crown / the which the queen of France has ordained: to the end that
it be delyuerd to the fader of the damoysel that shall have the prys and honor
of the field and of the Ioustes / and the knight that / shall get the prys and
thonour of the ioustes shall have the iij. baners and the three jewellys that been
in the^ and commanded that the baner of normandye should first make his mustre
and next te baner of Counstau^ce / and then^e that of Dyenne

And first under the baner of normandye were they that follow / that is to wete

And when the mustre was made / every baner returned in to his place / which
much noble and meruaillous thing was it to see: and to byholde the noblesse
of baron^s and knights so well horsed and armed as they were. and the daulphyn
and sir jaques fader of paris were comen to see the feste and the joustes

How paris wan the prys at the joustes in the cite of Paris.
When then^ it came to the hour of tyerce began the ioustes and came into the
field much nobly armed Johan sone of therle of flaundres: and ageyn him came
Ioha^ sone of the duke of breuuez and coped together so fyersly: that they brake
their speres. and johan sone of therle of flaundres tumbled to therthe under
his horse: and after aye^sthohan de breuuez came Edward sone of the duke of
bourgoyne These two knights beat down puyssau^tly johan de breuuez / unto the
time that there came against him Johan peryllous duc of norma^dye. which smote
him wit so great force that he ouerthrewe hi^ under his horse and brake his arm
and put him in such estate that he wist not whether it was day or night. and
against Johan perilous came Anthonye alegre sone of the duc of carues and did
so much prowess with his person that he conquered Johan peryllous and. v.
other knights mighty men of his party. whom he smote to the earth by force of
arms After came against Anthonye alegre Geffroy of pycardye: and smote Antonye
alegre in such wise that he fyl to the earth / and. vj. other strong knights
of his party. and after did so meruayllous feats of arms / that every man
said that he had thonour of the field And then^ came the free knight paris
against geffroy beryng low his spear / and they gaf so great strokes that the
knights and horses went al to therthe / wherefore the king said / that sithe
both two were throwe^ to the earth / that they should return ageyn to the
ioustes. and paris with a great desire consented / and so both returned and
came rennyng. And paris gaf to geffroy so great a stroke / that his horse stood
and theu^e geffroy ouerthrewe to the earth. but by cause that the horse stood /
it was said that the horse was cause that he ouerthrewe. For much they mayntened
geffroy and said that he was not vaynquysshed: and that it should be well done
that they should iouste ageyn / and by cause that paris was not known there was
none that mayntened him ne sustained / nevertheless the king of france knew
well that geffroy was vaynqynysshed loyally and well For he had well seen the
adventure. and would do no wrong unto the knight which was of great strenghte
and might and anon sent him an heraulde which said to him in the name of the
king of france / that the king had well see^ and well know that paris had
vaynquysshed his knight / notwithstan^ding if he would yet ones return to the
iouste by his noblesse: that he should do himself great honor / and then^
paris maad his answer saying that the beauty of his lady vye^ne was so great
that in all the world was none to her like. that if it pleased ye king. he was
ready for to furnysshe the ioustes for his love against the knight an other time
/ and to iouste till that geffroy should be vaynquysshed and that was without
any gayn saye^g and the heraulde returned and told it to the ki^ge Whereof the
king was well conte^te and said that the knight ought to be sum great lord.
for he was of great valor and puissau^ce and spoke much swetely and
curtoyssy. And after paris changed and took an other horse. Which Edward his
felawe had made ready for him and returned to the ioustes / and smote to gyder
with so great might: that by very force Geffroy went to the earth under his
horse right evil hurt.

Then^e when it came toward eue^ / the ioustes were so great thick and strong
/ that all the three parties as well of one as of other were throwe^ dou^to the
earth: that there abode no moo of the party of vye^ne vnt paris allone: and of
the party of normandye three knights strong and puyssau^t And they were
Balaxo Brother of the Marquys of Saluces: Johan sone of the earl of Armynak /
And phelyp of banyere / And of the party of Constaunce other three strong and
mighty / that is to wete Ioha^ of braba^d Larer neuew of the duc of bourgeyn
and Salamon dala^son Brother of the count de la march: and they said that
the iustes should abide ty^on the morn: For they were much weary and wha^ paris
saw that they would have returned / he fewtred his fyere / and there came against
him balaxo brother of the marquys of saluces / and paris at the first stroke
struck him down to the earth under his horse / and in like wise did to the
other. v. and much nobly and valyauntly he wanne thonour of the ioustes and of
the field

How the king commanded that the three baners with the three jewellys / should be
given to Paris champyon of vyenne
THe ioustes fynisshed paris wa^ne the beauty of this lady the fair vyenne.
and he was led to the scaffolde: where as the king was / and the other great
lords and knights. and there were delivered to him the three baners and the
three iewellys that were in them / and paris showed them through all the field /
in sign / that the said Dyenne had gote^ thonour for to be the fairest
damoysel that was in all the world / by the same yo^ge knight / And wha^
paris had the three fair baners and the three rich ye wellys / He and Edward his
felawe departed out of the cite of paris and out of france: the most secret
wise that they might: and returned in to daulphine / Paris returned into the
company of the foresaid bishop of saint laurence. as he hadd not been at the
feste: and always he demanded tidinges of the ioustes that were made in
france. and who had thonour of the ioustes

Wha^ the feste was made all the barons and knights that were there had great
desire to know. who was he that so vaylliauntly and so nobly had won the
yourneye and the honor of the ioustes for to do to him worship. but they
could never know hi^: whereof they had great displaysir / and said that the
knight was of great wisdom: because he would not be known. And after this the
baron^s and knights took leave of the king / and returned into their lands al
discomforted: by cause they had not gote^ the honor of the feste. and yet were
they more angry because they knew not to whom the honor was given of the
feste ne of the ioustes The king of france which much loved the Daulphin
made to him great feste and much great honor / And the king delivered to him
the crown that the queen had given for to give to her that should have the
honor of the ioulies. to the end that he should give his unto his daughter
vyenne in sign and toke^ that she was the most fair damoisel of the world. and
wha^ all this was doo^. the dolphyn and the fad of paris returned into the
dolphyne i^ much great honor and great joy. When vyenne knew that her fader
came she came and met him as she was acustomed: Then^ wha^ the daulphi saw
her. he kyssed her and set on her head the crown which the king had given
him. and told to her how she had gotten thonour for to be the most fairest
damoysell of the world / and loo here is the fair crown that the queen of
france se^deth to you in toke^ that ye have gote^ the honor / Notwythstanding
fair daughter. that ye have hadd many contrary thereto / but ye have had a good
deffe^dour and right strong and has well quyted him in your need: For of each
party were abyden three knights much strong and puissaunte. and on your
pertye was left but one knight only which vaynguysshed all the other /
without any token / and is deperted all secretly that no man knew him / ne
the king of france has no knowleche of him. but he has borne away with him
the three baners and the iij. jewellys that were in them / and also the prys and
thonour of the feste. Wherefore sweet and fair doughtere: ye wot never to who^
to give tha^kinges of so much honor / as has be don for you / but ye pray
to god of henen and to the glorious vyrgyn marye. that it playse him to give to
him good and honor. joy and excellence. and in all his faytes victory. like
as he is chyef and head of all honor and of al cheualerye in this world. For
i never saw ne herd of knight that so gracyously and so curtously bare him in
his arms and in his chyualryes / and wha^ vyenne herd speak of these tydinges.
and saw the great honor and prys that the had gotten and al was comen by this
noble knight / she said to ysabeau her damoysell. My sister said I not to you
well but late. that I was byloued by the most noble and vayliaunt knight of
france. and by my faith my sweet suster: this is he that so swetely soge and
that wanne the youstes in this cite and bare wit him the shield of cristal and
my garlonde and went his way so that no man might know him Advise you well
fair sister what honor is comen to me by his prowess and by his bounte. I may
well be sorry and dolant when i may not know who he is and mine heart is much
heavy and mine entendeme^t that i never ca^ find the moyen to see and know him.
and yet she said Certes my sweet suster isabeau i believe that my days be
short. and that i shall deye of sum cruel and falls death / for the great
displaysir that I have continuelli in my heart For i can none other thing do
but weep and waylle / and all way to continue in soroufuti life and heavy / but
none apperceyued it but only her damoysel ysabeau

The fader of paris which had been with the daulphyn in that feste had not seen
there his sone paris / whereof he had great sorrow in his heart. For he had seen
that he was acustomed to be in all noble ioustes / but then he saw him goo
with the bishop of saint laure^ce: and disposed him not to do arms as he was
woned: where for he said to him on a day: My sone i had hoped to have had in the
great consolacio^ / but nou thou bryngest me into great heaviness and
displaisir. wha^ i see that thou will not depart from this bishop. Wherefore I
pray the / that thou leave hi^: and do so that it may be to me playsaunt and to
the honneste Paris herd him well. but he gaf not a word to answer. The fader of
paris seeing this went to his secret felawe Edward and said to hi^ / I see
well that the great amytye and love that ye have to my sone and know ye for
certai that I have in my heart great melancolye wha^ i remember that paris has
had great honor and fame of chyualrye. and now i see that he^gooth al wit this
bishop. and leteth his hawks his hon^des and horse to deye for ho^gre.
Wherefore I pray you that ye will give me some cou^ceyl: which am so meschau^t
that i deye for sorrow. and wha^ he had said these words / edward had pity of
hi^ and comforted hi^ the besie wise he conde and departed fro him and went
strayte to his felawe Paris and said to him. I know well that love constrayneth
the so strongely. that thou have no power over thy self / Wherefore thy life may
not long endure And also thy fader and thy friends ben evil co^tente against
the. and i say to the that for to be vert^ous and vayliau^t it playseth much
to god / and for the love of one woman thou do much desplaisir to thy fader.
And also for no person what someuer he or she be / thou ought not to lose
the well and renommee that thou have of chyualerye. It appyreth not in the.
that thou have any virtue / or courage / Wherefore i pray the that thou wylt do
some thing that it may be playsau^t to thy fader / which has desired and
prayed me that I should so say to the. When paris had herd al this: he a^swerd
and said to hi^ know well that these things that thou have said to me bee^
virtuous and ho^nest / but they been to me grevous. for to put me from the
thoughts in the which I am co^tynuelly. Nevertheless i pray the that thou give
me counceyl what is best that i do Then^ said edward if should well playse me
if it were thy playsir that we should goo into braband: For it is vj. months
passed that I have not seen my lady. and there shall we do arms / by which we
may get fame and honor / and paris agreed thereto / saying that he was
content if it playsed hi^ so to do. and incontine^t they made ready their
harnoys and horses / and all things necessary to them: and or paris departed
he put in his chamber all the things and pryses that he had won by
cheualryes. and closed them fast in his chamber / and deliuerd the keye to his
mother. and prayed her much derly: that she should not open if / ne suffer that
any person should e^tre therein. And after they went toward Braband. Where as
they did great feats of Theualerie and ioustes / whereof they gate great
honor and worship / and were much praised of ladies and damoyselles / And
paris made countenance for to have abyden in braband for the love of edward.
but his heart drew unto the fair vyenne / whom he so much loved in his heart
secretly

How Dyane and vyenne her daughter wenten to vysite the fader of Paris / the
which was seek
NOw it happened that durig this time that Paris and Edward duelled in Braband:
the fader of paris fyl in to a sickness of feures or access. And the cause
came of the thought that he had of his sone paris And he being seek / the
daulphyn went on a day to see him and demanded the cause of his maladye. and
comforted him the best wise that he could. and after returned home / and said
to his wife / that it were well done that the should goo see and vysite messyre
jaques: which was seek. and forth with incontinent my lady diane. her daughter
vye^ne and ysebeau her damoisell wit a great company went to the castle of
sir jaques / and sale wed him much nobly as it well apperteyned. and the best
wise that they might: And when they were in the chamber where messyre Jaques
was and lay / Dame dyane demanded him of his sickness. and messyre jaques
said that all his / disease came for his sone paris / because he lost so his
time / and that he went always wit the bishop of saint laure^ce. Whereof i fere
me that he shall become a man of relygyon / I have no moo children but him / I
wot not what i shall do wit the goods that god has given to me. and my lady
diane conforted hi^. and said that his sone was much well belould of the
daulphyn / and that he had much great amytye of many great lords barons and
knights. and alsoo she said that among all things he should ordeyn^ for his
health / and after al this: the mother of paris prayed her that it might plaise
her to come see the castle: and she answered that she much desired it / Then^e
the mother of paris showed her all the castle and led her into an halle all full
of arms and abyleme^ts of war / for to fight in bataill. After she ladde her
ito an other hall where as were many hawks / faulcons and many other fowls of
chase. and after in to many other halles and cha^bres rychely arrayed which were
over long to reherce: And after the mother of paris showed unto her the chamber
of paris where that he slepte. Wherein were many habilleme^ts / which should well
suffyce the chamber of a great prince / and in the said chamber were two
great sta^dardes couerd after the guyse of france. That one was full of clothe
of goolde and sylke: and that other of harnoys and of other many things. Then^
said vye^ne to ysabeau / by my faith fair sister I have no great marvel of
this yo^ge knight paris though of him be maade great me^cyon For thordynnan^ce
of thise things show well that he is of great valor. and in beholding of
these things she saw acouerture of an horse all white: and her seemed that it
was the same that the knight bare that wa^ne the prys of the ioustes that was
made in the cite of Dyenne / and that had the shield of crystal: and the
garlond which she told to ysabeeu. and ysabeau a^swerd to her / never think
ye so / for all day been made semblable couertures and tokenes white: whereof
ye may well be deceived. And Dyenne enforced all way her selff to take better
head. and of the great joy that she had she said to her mother Madame I am a
lytil crased and sodaynli taken. Wherefore if it playse you i would feign rest a
little in this chamber: and late me be all allone with my sister ysabeau / For
I will have none other and anon each body avoided owte of the chamber: and
ysabeu did shytte the door that none might come in.

Then^e said vyenne: now / we shall see if we may find any thing that we may
have better knowleche of for mine / heart says yes / After that they had
serched and vysyted all the chamber: they came on a side of the chamber where
they fond a little door: of which henge a little keye by a the wa^ge / and
anon they opened the door and entered therein / And there was a little chamber
which was xij. foot long. and was an oratorye. Where as was the mageste of
our Lord Ihesu christ upon a little altar. and at each corner was a ca^del /
styke of silver / and thither came paris for to make his sacrefyce when he aroos
/ and when he went to his bed. And there were the three baners that the noble
knight paris had won in the cite of Paris / and the three jewellys of the three
damoyselles before said And in the same place was also the sheld of Crystal and
the garlond that Vye^ne delyuerd to him: wha^ he wanne the prys at the ioustes
in cite of Vyenne / And all these he kept secret in that place / And wha^
vienne saw these things. she was sure that paris was he whom^ she had so
much desired to know: and that so much honor had done to her. and for the
great joy that she had. she set her dou^ on the ground. and there abode a
great while and could not speak a word and after she spoke to Isabeau and
fayde. My sweet sister / blessed and preysed be our lord of this good yourney.
For me thi^keth I should never depart out of this chamber. A alas I have so
long abyden to know who he was that so swetely played in his instruments so
nygh unto me and now he is so far. and then^e ysabeau began to repreue her
and said to her. Sweet lady I pray you that ye say ne do any thing which might
torn you to folly / and be ye ruled by wisdom and reason For notwithsto^dyng
that paris have so much good and virtues. yet ye ought to consider that he is
not egal to you in lygnage ne in estate / For i know well that many noble and
puyssau^t lords have demanded you in marriage: and love you and do great
tginges for you. and also thonour of paris which is your vayssal and subget is
not egall ue worthy unto you / Then^e vye^ne was much angry on ysabeau / and
began to say: A very god I am well discomforted by the. that thus again say
me of hi^ / that I so long have desired to know: Alas I have supposed that in
nothing ye would have displaysed me: and in good faith I said to the that this
man I will love and demand and I promise the in good faith that if thon any
more gaynsaye me i shall flee my self / and then thou shall be cause of my
death / For I will not lose him that I have so long loved But I say to the for
troth that if thou ever say to me such words of my friend paris. that thou
shall never after have space to say them ageyn an other time: for thou
considerest well his noble co^dicyo^s and acustomes / thou sholdest preyse him
better tha^ thou do and know not thou well that the king of france would
that it had cost him half his toyaume that his sone Lowys were as vayliau^te
as paris is And also there be many notable lords that desire to know his name
/ and to have his amytye

Then^e take heed and byholde by my faith: if ever thou saw man that might be
compared to him. certainly all virtues been in him / and sithe that fortune
has brought me to his love / he is worthy to have my love. and yet more than
is in me / and have I not reason and cause then to love him / which has
done to me so great good and honor. and doubtyng no peril of his person. and
is it not well great worship to my fader / to have for vaissal and subget the
best knight that is no all the world For in all the world is no knight that i
would forsake paris fore: ne one that has doo^ so much for me / And thus to
speak of the feats of paris she could not stynte. Then^e came two damoyselles
knockyng at the chamber door saying. Vye^ne ye must come to my lady And ysabeau
sprang out saye^g that she should come anon: And vienne seeing that she must
needs deperte fro thens said to ysabeau My suster sith we must deperte hens
late us take sum of these jewellys. and we shall keep them secretly till that
paris becomen and we shall see what co^tenau^ce he shall make in him self.

When^e they took the colyer and the white baner of vyenne and other iewellys
and hid the^ under their clothes. and went into the chamber of messyre
Jacques: But vyenne desydered greatly to speak with paris and thought long or he
came home. and in the mean while messyre jaques recouuerd of his maladye and
bycam all hool whereof vye^ne had great joye. but she durst not show it / How
paris and Edward returned out of braband

After certain time that Paris had be in Braband wit his felawe Edward / he
desired strongely to see the fair vye^ne For the love of her destrayned him
much stro^geli. Nevertheless he durst not tell it to his fellow / to the^de
that he should take no displaysir of his departing / And sone after the space
of v. days paris received a letter that his fader was seek / and then he
said to Edward / Right dear brother and felawe. plesith it you to wete that mi
fader is fore seek. and me seems hit were good that we departed if ye
consent. but I pray you that ye take no displaysir in this departing for if
it play se good we shall sone return And edward seeing the just reason of paris
and his good will: said to him that he was well content and plesyd Wherefore
incontyne^te they departed out of Braband and came into the cite of vye^ne. of
whose coming messyr jaques had souerayn plaisir / specially because he had herd
that paris his sone had doo^ valyau^tli feats of arms. Now it happed that
wha^ paris was arrived at home wit his fader like as he was acustomed all way
to fore or he went to his bed. he went to make his oroisons and prayers /
and after he advised if he lacked any thing. and fo^de that tho things that
he loved heste were taken away / whereof he was much angri and as half in
despair: in such wise that all the night he could not sleep: and wha^ it came in
the morning he came to his mod and said Mother how is it yt ye have not kept my
chamber cloos and shytte / For I lack certain things which i would not gladly
lose / and have for them great dysplaysir / To whom her mother answered My sone
by my faith / there never entered therein person. but on a time wha^ your fader
was seek / came my lady diane and her daughter Vye^ne / and wha^ they had
vysited your fad: they went al about for to see this castle. and then^e they
entered in to your chamber / But I can not think that they took any thing for
they tarried not long Sauf only vyenne which tarried only allon^ sauf her
damoisel. by cause she was evil at ease at her heart / wherefore mi dear sone
paris i pray you to take no displaysir. And then^ paris said to him self. if
none other thief have taken it sauf she / i shall not be dyscouerd Nevertheless i
wot never if vyenne has taken it away. for any thing. And after he arrayed
him self and cladde him much nobly and went to do the reverence to the
Daulphin and to dame Dyane. And after to vyenne their daughter and the daulphyn
received him much curtoisly. and the daulphyn demanded him tydinges and of
many other things. And wha^ the fair lady vienne saw paris of the great
desire / that she had to see him. and of the great love that she bare to him:
all her chere was colored like a fresshe rose in the monthe of may / and
could not be content ne filled to behold her fair love and friend paris. And
the more she beheld him: the more grew and entreaced her love toward him: and
paris being tofore the daulphyn on his knee much humbly: durst not look on
vyenne But in his heart he had great pain. and who had well behold him / had
well seen in his vysage his thought And after that the daulphyn had demanded
him of that it plased him / Paris took leave of the daulphyn: and of my lady
diane. and of vye^ne their daughter. and returned home to his faders house.

After a few days Vye^ne in such wise as love destrayned her said to her
damoisel ysabeau / my sister know ye for troth that me seems that paris is
much pe^syf / and I believe that it is for his things which he fyndeth not in
his oratorie. me seems it is best that we let him have knowleche that we
have them. Isabeau a^swerd / it were well doo^ so: but that it be doo^ honestly
and secretly: Then^ said vyenne. i shall advise the manner After certain days
vye^ne said to his mother / madame i let you wete that I am a lytyl charged in
my xscye^ce. and i would fayn confess me to sum good person. and it is told
to me that the bishop of saint laure^ce is a much honest man and devout /
wherefore madame i pray you to send for hi^ that i might spek wit hi^. and my
lady dyane seeing the good will of her dought sete for to fetch the bishop.
And vienne xfessyd her to hi^ much deuoutely speking always of our lord and of
his commandments / and after that she was confessyd. she prayed the bishop
that he would come ageyn on the morn^ / for she fond great comfort in his
words: and that she would tell him sum things in great secret. And on the
morn the bishop came ageyn to vye^ne / and vye^ne said to him thus My
ghoostly fader sum things have been taken a way in a place / the which
longen to paris sone of messyre Jacques And the person that has them has
thereof conscience / And therefore I pray you as much as I may. that by your
benygnyte ye say to him that if he may. he come to morn hither with you: and
the bishop which him no thing of thenter thought of vyenne said she bring
him without fau^^

How the fair vyenne discouuerd her courage to paris
N the morn the bishop came much diligently and brou^ir paris with him. And
(...) paris without to make any sem^launte of love / and paris rendered his
salewes ageyn much humbly / and then^ vienne withdrewe her fro the bishop and
the other / and said to paris. it is not long sithe ye were goon in to braband
and that i acco^panyed my lady my mother for to goo vysite your fader which
then^e was seek / and we saw and beheld all the the castle until we came to
yowr oratorye. and there I saw certain rewellys which much well pleased me
and i took them and have kept them until this present time. and I shall now
render them to you ageyn. and therefore I pray you that if I have done any
displaisir or maad any defaulte that ye will pardo^ne me. For i promise to you
by my faith that i have done it for noo^ evil. To whom paris answered humbli
and with great reverence and said much curtoysly. madame by your courtosye ye
came to vysite my fader. of which visitacio^ not only my fader. but all our
friends / have received great and souerayn honor: wherefore mine excellent lady
My fader my mother and I been all youres / and all that we have also And if by
adventure your ladyshyp had any playsir to take of my jewelles: I ensure you by
my faith. that mine heart has therein much greter playsir tha^ heart of man may
think: and yet more should have if the said Iewellys were better the half tha^
they be / So then^e I pray you right hononrable damoisel that ye will perdo^ne
me For not all only these jewelles which been of little valewe but my fader my
mother and I bee^ all youres and already to obey to your service / and know ye
verayli that it is not long sythen. that the said yewelles were by a frensshe
knight given to me.

Then said Vyenne ye need not to say to me fro whe^s these jewelles ben
comen For I know the^ as well as ye: And vye^ne said I meruaille me greatly hou
ye so long have hid your love fro me / I pray you as much as I may / and
by the faith that ye have toward me that ye say to me the truth of that
which I shall demand you / for much I desire it to know Then^e said Paris
right honorable damoyselle / ye ought not to pray me. where ye have power to
command me. For all that. your ladysshyp shall plese to demand me I shall
say to you the troth with good heart and good will: Then said vye^ne I will
first that ye say the truth that if ye were he / that in such a year came
every night syngyng and sownyng instruments so swetely to fore my chamber /
After I will that ye tell me If ye wanne the ioustes yt were maade the first
day of may in this cite And if ye bare away the shield of crystalle. and the
chapelet which I have seen in your oratorye After i will that ye say to me / ye
wa^ne the ioustes the vviij. of septembre / which were made in the cite of
paris / where as were so many noble knights and baron^s. and if ye had gote^
there the three baners which I have seen in your oratorye / and I pray you
that ye tell to me if ye have done to me such service. for such things ye
ought not to hyde. And by adventure ye have doo^ them for the love of my fader
or of his court: we be much holden to you and be bounde^ to thank you / and
if by adventure for any lady or for the love of me ye have done it / I thank
you as much as I may / and it is well reason that ye therefore be rewarded: And
yet said vye^ne to paris: know ye for truth / that it is long sithe that i
have desired to know: and yet desire strongely to know it. wherefore if ye
will do me any playsir: I pray you yt ye say to me truth / without leuyng of
any oneli thing or word.

Then^e said paris much humbly wit great shame fasines that he had to utter
the folly that he had enterprysed Right honorable and fair lady i am not
worthy to be named him which has done this / which it has pleased you to
demand of me: but notwithstanding that I be a man of lytyl estate I humbly
supply you that in caas ye shall find dysplaysir in my words that it playse
you to perdonne me / and that ye take no displaysir i that I shall say / for
your noblesse shall not be the less in valor. For mi caas enforces me to say
that / which is to me folly to think / Then^e paris al shamefast and in great
reverence / knelyng upon his knee said Right worshypful damoisel paris your
indigne servant is he of whom^ ye have spoken and demanded and shall to you
obey and serve in all things that ye have demanded me. For sithe that I
have had any rememberau^ce: my will and my thought has be submysed to your
noble person / and shall be as long as I shall live. Theu said vye^ne / Paris
my sweet friend. it is not now time that I make answer to your words For it
should be ouerlonge to recounte. But that notwithsto^dyng i will well that ye
know that your love destrayneth me so strongely / that there is no thing in
the world that I love so much as you / wherefore abide in good hoope
ioyously: for if it playse god ye shall see that this which I say shall be
threw / Then^e said paris Madame who may think the ioyouste in which I am by
your answer whiis to me right sweet / For I never supposed to have had so
sweet an answer of you: but for to have endured in pain and in languesshyng
For not only to me. but unto a king should be over much to have your love /
and I pray god that I may do such things as may be to you playsaunt / and
that I never live to do to you thing that should desplaise you: ne torn you to
melancolye / and thus departed that one fro that other in gretter love tha^ to
fore. and took term to see each other ageyn as hastily as they might: and
vyenne returned more yoyoussy tha^ she showed / and went into her chamber. and
after the bishop deperted / and paris accompanied him unto his palace. and
took leave of him and returned home into his faders loggyng / and after told to
Edward his fellow all the parliament that he had with vyenne. and Edward said
to him. fair brother and friend. here in is no lape ne truffes / but I pray
you that ye do your things secretly for there ben many false tongues / and
vyenne was much more joyous tha^ she had been acustomed / and paris also. and
the said paris and his felawe made great chyualtyes and did great arms which
where much playsau^t to the fair vyenne / Then^e it happed that after certai^
time seeing the daulphi that his daughter was come to xv. year of age trented
for to give to her an husbond: and many times he had been required of many noble
princes but by cause he had but her only and no moo sons ne daughters uneath
he would co^sente. and in treatyng thus of marriage Paris herd sum tydinges
whereof he was fore enyoyed in himself / and thought / Why think not i to have
this noble lady. which is so much desired of so many noble princes and
barons. and fore bewailed himself / and did somoche that he spoke to vyenne: O
sweet and fair vye^ne Where is your fair and agreeable promise that ye made to
me when i departed fro you and how may it be. that your fader speaks for to
marye you.

When vyenne herd paris speak in this manner / she said to him / paris if my
fader speak to me of marriage: it is no great meruaylle. For i may not deffende
him Nevertheless Ihaue not consented to any marriage / and ye know well that
marriage is nothing worth. without the consenting of both parties. Wherefore I
pray you to be co^tente. For I promise to you that I shall never have man in
marriage but you / and I would that yt should be shortly accomplysshed if yt
pleased god honestly and justly and not in sin ne in ordure: Therefore / will
that ye assaye one thing: which shall be much diffycile to do and right
peryllous: but nevertheless it byhouneth that it be done / then^e said paris /
honorable lady that which shall playse you to commau^de me: I shall
acco^plysshe it wit god heart though i should deye And then^e said vyenne: I will
that incontyne^t ye say to your fader / that he goo to my lord my fader. and
require him that he give me in marriage to you. and that therein there be no
deffaulte: And wha^ paris herd the will and desire of vyenne. he was as al
abashed and said Right honorable lady and how / will ye that I deye thus / I
pray you much humbly / if it please you. that it be not do thus Then^e
vye^ne said set ye so little by me / that ye will not enterprise this: alas
where is your ente^dement Lertes it must needs be done. Inco^tyne^t paris
a^swerd worshypfull lady / sithe it playseth you / I shall acco^plysshe your
commandment though I should deep therefore an hundred thou / and times: and
thus took leave of vye^ne and went to his fader incontine^t and said to him
Dear fader all way ye have showed to me great love. wherefore i beseech
almighty god that he reward / you like as i desire Dear and honorable fader I
would pray you of one thing. and because it is doubtous i will that ye promise
it to me to fore i say it to you: for else I will not say it unto you / and his
fader said to him My sone there is nothing in the world that I may do for the:
but i shall acco^plisshe it by the grace of god / therefore say to me thy plaisir
and will. and then^e Paris told to his fader a perte of the pryuete and
promise that he had with vyenne / because he should with the better will do
that: which he would require him Then^ said paris to his fader. the prayer that
i pray and require you is. that it playse you to say to the daulphyn. that he
give to me his daughter to will and in marriage / and I humbly byseche you that
herein ye will not faylle me. and messyre jaques hering his sone thus speak.
almoost he was fro him self for the great so he that his sone paris has said
to him: and he said in repreuyng him that he never should speak more of that
fair for he would not deye for his daughter / and that he should demand of
hi^ sum other things / for it were great folly to speak to him of such a
thing. And paris said / whorshypful fader: as much peryllous is it to me as
to you therefore i am abashed thugh ye reffused to do it. But love enforces
and constreyneth me so strongely that I am halff confuse: and am as well
conte^te that he do it not as to do it / but that ye do your deuoir only: and
so long paris prayed his fader that he promised him to do it

How messire Jaques demanded of the daulphyn his daughter vye^ne in marriage
for his sone paris
THen^e went messyre jaques to the Daulphyn all / changed of color and said
to hi^ / My right redoubted and fouerayn lord a certain queste is made to me
which i must say unto you / the which me semeih is of passing little reason and
therefore it must be at your mercy. and in caas ye find therein displaysir that
ye pardonne me / and to take no regard to my great folly: The daulphyn
trustyng in the great wisdom of messyre jaques granted him to say what
someuer he would / Then^ said messyre Jaques. Mine hye and souerayn lord: Paris
my sone has ^rayed me so much that I should require of you vyenne your
daughter to be his wife. the which thing is not only to say / but also to
think great presumpcyon and great folly / but the love of my sone constrayneth
me so strongely / that biforce I must say it to you. And suddenly the daulphin
was moved in great felonny. and would not suffer him to e^de his words. but
repreued him much hardly. saying. Dylayne and vassal that thou art. how
kepest thou my worshypby god I shall well chastyse you / that ye shall never
think such things. and commanded him that incontinent he should depart
thens: and that never he ne his sone should come in his sight. wherefore messire
jaques deperted the^s much rebuked holdyng dou^ his heed and returned in to his
house / and told to his sone Paris all that had be said and done bytweene hi^.
and the dolphi^ whereof paris thanked much his fader. The dolphin went in great
thought through the palace having great i^dignacyo^ and all angry in so much
that none durst speak to hi^ ne come in his way. and he being thus in this
manner / he sent for his daughter vye^ne / and made her to come to him. and
said to her / When have had words of great displaysir. This vilayne messyre
jaques has said to us that we should give you to wife and i^ marriage to his sone
paris. Advise you what wysedo^ it were / by god or that I should do it. i would
rather make you a no^ne or a menchon: and it shall not be long to. but that ye
shall be hyely married: so that ye shall hold you content. and here i swear to
you / that if it were not for the great seruyces that he has doo^ to me
incontine^t i should do smite of his head: and wha^ vye^ne saw her fader i^ so
great agree against messyre jaques and his sone. she sent to seche Edward for to
come speak to her / and when edward was come: wye^ne said to hi^. edward it is
(...): that my fader is much angri against messyre jaques and against paris
whereof I have great displaysir and have great doubt that my fader will do sum
harm to paris: and therefore i will that ye say to him. that he keep himself in
the most secretest wise that he may / and I shall also see the manner if I
appease his felo^nye and anger Then Edward inco^tine^t took leave of vye^ne
and went and said to hi^ and said fair brother. me seems that it were good yt
ye departed out of his country for to absente you for a space of time / for
it may be that to the dolphyn shall long endure his a^gre. as I understood by
that which vyenne has said to me: Then^ answered paris / if the that ye have
cou^ceylled me so. I shall do so. notwithstanding that it shall be to me a
sorouful and an heavy departing buter I depart i shall take leave of vyenne
though I should deye.

Tehn^e paris did so much that he spoke unto vye^ne on a derke might / at a
low wyndowe. where as they might well say what there world. i am certain said
vye^ne that my fad has will to hurt you: whereof I live in great mela^colye.
For in all the world is nothing that I love so much as you. and if by
adventure ye deye I will not live / Then^e said paris honorable lady it seems
me best that i depart fro hens a certain time till my lord your fader be more
peased and has passed his evil will / how be it. that it shall be to me a
much sorouful thing to withdraw me for you For my life shall be much heavy /
Nevertheless I shall acco^plisse your will in all that ye shall command me /
what someuer come thereof. and vye^ne seeing the good will of paris after many
words she said to him / Paris my friend i know well the great love that ye
bear to me. and sithe it so is. i swear to you by my faith that ye shall never
depart fro this cite with out that I goo with you: For it is my will.
wherefore as soon as ye may make you ready for all things necessary / and find
ye the manner that we may escape out of the Royaulme of france. and that we
may goo in to some other lordshippe: where as we may live joyously and surely /
Nevertheless to fore or we depart from hens I will that ye promise two things /
the first is that ye touch not my body unto the time that we be lawfully
married The second is that ysabeau part i^ all the goods that we shall have /
and other thing will I not as for this p^sent time / but that only our
departing may be shortly / and I shall pourueye sum jewelles and money for
our necessyte. and all this paris promised to her / and each departed fro other
for tadresse such things as to the^ should be necessary:

When paris was deperted fro vyenne he went to a man named george. and said
to him / George my friend always I have trusted in you: and have always loved
you. wherefore i pray you now that to this I shall say you ye faylle me not.
for I promise you ye shall notlese thereby. and george promised to him to do all that shall be to hi^ possible wit right good heart / and then^ paris said to hi^.
know ye for certai^ that I have wrath and ra^cour to a man of this town for
certai^ displaisir that he has done to me / wherefore i will ^^ee him. and
inco^tine^t as ye have slain hi^ i will depart out of the royaume of France.
Wherefore my friend I pray you yt ye will go to Ayguesmortes / and that ye there
make ready a galeye furnisshed of al things necessary till that we be arrived
there as we would be / And also I pray you that ye do ordeyne fro he^s to
ayguesmortes fro. v. mile to. until always good horses ready to the^de that we
may surely refresshe us if it be need. and also I will that ye do this as
secretly as ye may. and loo here is money enough for to furnisshe these said
things George said / i shall do all this gladly / and inco^tine^t made him
ready. and wha^ he came to ayguesmortes he hired a galepe / and establisshed all the passages. and did well all that paris had charged him and came ageyn. and
told to paris how he had pourueyd al yt he had charged him / whereof paris was
much joyous. and anon paris went and told to vye^ne that all things that
she had commanded where done / and then^e they concluded that the next night
following that a certain hour each of the^ should be ready: then^e he took leave of
her and went home: and bad george to take ij. horses out of his stable: and yt
he should sadle the^ / and abide hi^ without the cite i^ a certain place till he
should come / and edward the felawe of paris wiste no thing of all this /
whereof he was much abashed and meruayl lous^y angry wha^ that he knew it

How paris ladde away vyenne and ysabeau by night
When paris was pouru^yed of money and of all other things being to the^
necessary he went allone the secretest wise that he night / and came to the
place emprysed at the hour taken / and he made a tokene which vyenne knew /
and anon vye^ne and ysabeau cladde them i^ma^nes array. and lepen out of the
castle by a fauce port. and so came these two damoiselles to the place where
as Paris was allone / which awayted upon their coming. and incontine^t they
departed and went where as their horses were. whom they took and rode as fast
as they might and george rode always to fore because to know well the way / and
whiles they thus rode / aroos a storm wit a great rain: which e^dured till on
the morn at night. and then^e they arrived nighe unto a little town / but
they entered not by cause they would not be known: and went and lodged them i^
a lityl church nygh unto the town: where they fond a chapelayn which
received them much gladly the best wise he might / and then wha^ they night
came. Paris and the chapelain stepte in a little house joynyng to the church:
George and paris servant stepten in the stable with the bestes And the say
vyenne and Y sabeau stepten in the church / and in the morning erly they went
lightly to horsebac. and rode till they came nyghe unto a River: which was
risen hye by cause of the rain that had fallen / Then^e paris was much angry
because he saw well that it was much peryllous: and said to george / that he
should search and advise sum good place where they might pass over: and
george wythdrewe him a little from the^ and chaas a place which thought him
good / and took the river with his horse / and wha^ he was in the mids of the
streme his horse faylled him that he was drowned and his horse also Paris seeing
that george was drowned was much fore abashed and durst make no se^blau^te.
because that the fair vye^ne should have no melancolye And after vyenne
demanded of paris where george was by come^ / and paris answer to her that he
had sent hi^ for to search sum good passage / and they would torn in to the
church ageyn till George were comen. And vyenne answered to him that it playsed
to her well so to do. For she had great doubt and fere for to pass the water
And wha^ they were in the church paris was much aferde to abide long in that
place / For he saw that it was not sure Wherefore he demanded the chapelayn /
if they might in any wise pass that water / and the chapelayn said not i^ iij.
days till the water were decreced and aualed And paris said to him that he
should goo in to the town to seche and se if he might find any men that would
make a bridge so that they might pass / and that he should spare for no money
/ for i shall pay to them as much as they will have / and the chapelayn said
that he should do his best Thus did paris no thing but think how they might
pass the river: Now leave we paris and torn we to the daulphi^: which had
lost his fair doughtere vyenne

How the daulphi^ did do search and seche vyenne by his servants
ON the morn^ that vye^ne was lost and departed fro the house of her fader: and
that the daulphyn knew it. he supposed to have goon out of his wit: and all the court was troubled / and sent hastily men^ on horsebak and a foot by
diverse parties the most secretly that he might and prayed them that they should
bring home to him vye^ne quyck or deed / it happed by adventure that one of
his men a foot: that was sent to seche vyenne came into the town where as the
chapelayn was come^ to seche me^ to make the bridge: The fotema^ demau^deded
every man if they had seen two damoiselles which were fled fro the daulphi^s
court / Thn^e the chappellayn said to him that hit was no long sith such
tweyne departed with other men. And the man supposed that the said chappelayn
had said it in jape or in mockyng And said that the Daulphyn was much angry /
and had sworn that if any man or woman knew there they were and showed it not
that he should make the^ to lose their hedes / and wha^ the chapelayn herd
these words he remembered him of the^ that we rehyd in his house / and in great
dread said to hi^ that he should tarry there a little. and that for the love of
my lord daulphyn he would gladly seche for them / and as soon as he might find
tidings of them / he should let him wit And / so deperted fro thens and
returned home ageyn and told all this to paris. and what he had herd i^ the
town saying also that he doubted that it was for them of his company Wherefore
he said to hi^ ferthermore Sir I pray you that ye deperte from hens and suffer
not that I lose my life But take ye the best counceyl ye can For there be^
fyfty men^ on horsebak that secheyon / When paryherde hi^ say this it needs
not to demand if he were heavy and mela^colyous and for the great sorrow that
he had he changed al his color / and he said to the chapelai^: I pray you yt
ye tarry a little and i shall make you an answer And then^e paris went to vye^ne
for to tell to her all this feat / And wha^ vyenne saw him enter and so
changed in his color said to paris. what tydinges bring ye which are so pale
and your color changed i pray you hertely as I can that it playse you to
tell me / Then^e paris said to her The tydinges that I bring ben evil for
you and form / For shortly shall be accomplisshed our adventure and therefore
I will slay my selff. and also he said complaynyng / O god how my life is
sorrowful and heavy to have brought this excellent lady as ye ar / in such
danger: o good god why gaf thou not to me the death to fore or that I fette her
out of her faders house O alas my fader and my mother what shall be fall of you.
when the daulphi^ shall know that I have stolen from him his daughter O my
good felawe Edward why counceylled not i with the tofore or I had done this
folly. And after he returned to vyenne saying and what shall fall of you my
lady / when your fader shall see you. Certes I think that how cruel that he be
/ wha^ he shall see your noble person his heart shall not suffer to do you any
harm O god almighty do to me that grace that I only may bear the pain of this
fayt and non other. O ladi unhappy was that day for you and for me when first
ye had acqueyntau^ce of me / And wha^ paris had fynysshed his complaynte. he
told to Vye^ne all that the chapelayn had said to him / and forwyth as a
person despayred / took his sword and would have ryuen yt through his body: and
vyenne as virtuous and valyaunte took to her heart. and took the sword fro him
and comforted him and said. O free knight / my yoye. my life and misolace /
what will ye do. know ye not well. that who that sleeth him self wytyngly /
sleeth the soul and the body. and if ye deye: I assure you I shall deye also
and so shall ye be cause of my death as well as of your own O paris where is
your wysedom and your prowess Now when ye should have most strength and
most virtuous courage ye be aferde: O my knight this is no new thing that
the persons that lyue^ in this world have tribulacio^s: of what someuer
lygnage they be Certes his is it not the courage of one so vaylyaunte knight as
ye be / For now whom that ye ought to comfort / she must now comforthe you:
and therefore my fair brother and friend / I pray you as much as ye may. that
incontynente ye depart fro hens. and that ye goo your way: and if ye do not
so I shall slay my self with your sword For your departing is as grievous to me
as mine shall be to you: but it byhouseth to eschew of two euyls the werse And
also ye ought to considere any thing that notwythsto^dyng the great fault and
trespaas that I have made to my fader / yet therefore he shall not put me to death
considered the great love that he has always had toward me And if ye were taken
I wot well that ye and I should both deye / and yet I have good hope that mine
entencyon shall come unto a good end For be ye sure though he never pardo^ne
me. I shall never have other husbond but you / and that I promise you by my
faith / But allewaye of any thing I pray you that for none other lady ye
forgete me. And when ye shall be in other countreye write unto me of your
adventure And to the end that ye the better remember me: loo here is a ring of
gold with a dyamo^de: the which I pray you that ye will keep for the love of
me.

How the gentle knight Paris departed from the fair Vyenne: and left her in
the church
AFter much other langage / paris kyssed vyenne with great syghes and
thoughts and she conforted him the best wise as she might / in prayeng our
lord isu crist that in short time she might see him / like as her heart desired
most of any thing that was in the world and then^ paris departed fro vye^ne
with great sorrow and heaviness. and took his way wit his seruau^te / til he
came to the river where they could not to fore pass: and as despayred doubted
no thing but entered therein: and the water was so aualed that they passed
without any peril. And they rode two days without any mete for they durst
not pass thourgh any town. and they passed til they came to ayguesmortes. and
there he found the galeye that george had hired / which anon he took. and
solonge sailed and rowed till that they arrived a Gene: Paris made meruaillous
countenaunces in the Galeye that all they that were therein / had supposed that
he had be a fool. for all way he was pensyf and ymagynatyf: and uneath would
speak ne say a word Then^ wha^ he was at Gene. he hired him alodgyng and lived
there in great heaviness and sorrow Now leave we to speak of Paris and return
we to vienne / which abode i^ the chapelayns house

How vyenne was found in the church by a fotema^: and how she was brought
ageyn to her fader
When paris was deperted fro vyenne she abode allone wit ysabeau making the
gretest sorrow of the world that it was a great pity to behold / like as she
had as leef to deye as to live / and wha^ she was well weary of wepi^g. and yt it
was force that she must return to the mercy of her fader the doulphin / she
appeased her self. and anon^ the chapelayn went for to seche the fotema^ and
brought him into the church, and wha^ vyenne saw him she knew hi^ well For
she had oftymes seen him i^ her faders house. and this man said to her all his
charge. and that many knights were out for to seche her And vyenne said to
him. goo and tell the^ that thou have found. me here: and bring them hither
/ Then^e the man went and fond the knights that then^e were comen in the
town. and told to the^ how he had founde^ her. and that they should come with
him and he would bri^ge them to the place where she was when the knights herd
these tidings anon each made great haste / till they came to her. Then^ wha^
they were to fore vye^ne they salewed her and said to her that the doulphin had
do seche her in diverse countries. and after they comforted her / and said that
she should not be aferde of her fader / for he would do to her no desplaysir.
for he shall have so great joye wha^ be shall see you. that he shall pardonne you
and appease his ire. And than incontinent they went to horseback and brought
forth the chapelayn with her to the end that he should excuse hyrtofore her
fader. and told hou she was pure clean of his body

Now says thistorie that wha^ vyenne was come^ tofore her fader the daulphyn,
he made to ward her heavy and evil chere But notwitstondyng vye^ne kneled down
on both her knees to the earth saying and in weeping Redoubted fader i see well
and know in my self that I have mesprysed and fallyed toward you. where of i
have great desplaysir / Nevertheless folysshe love has enforced me to love him:
which is well worthy to be byloued of the most grettest lady of the Royaume of
france all way seen the noblenes that is in him For I wene that in all the
world is non^ to him like ne pareylle: And alsoo I think that I am not the
first that have trespaced by semblable reasons Wherefore redoubted fader I am in
your mercy and take of me ve^geau^ce / such as shall playse you. and to me
chastyseme^t and example to other / Nevertheless I will well that ye know and
that I swre by my soul: that I am as pure and clean of my body as i was that
day that I deperted fro he^s And loo here the chapelayn which can say to you
the truth. And then^ the chapelai^ told how she came wit iij. men / of who^
that one was a much fair knight young and curtoys. the which I believe is
drowned in passing a ryner / And they were i^ mine house / and the two
damoyselles slept to gyder in the church / and the knight slepte with me. and
the other. ij. slepte in the stable with the horses. Then^e wha^ the daulphin
herd these tydinges he had right great playsir / of which he made no
sembla^^e: and gaf to the chapelayn much money and great yeftes / and bad him
return After the dolphyn took vienne by the hand in repreuyng her much
gretely / and lad her in to her moders chamber with ysabeau / for her mother was
seek of the great sorrow that she had for her daughter And there the mother
blamed them both two / And ysabeau said that vye^ne was as pure and clean of
her body as she was the day that she departed. Alas said the dolphi^: thou have
put us in the most grettest shame of the world. And I promise that all they
that have conse^ted thereto shall be well punysshed: and in especial that evil
traytre paris which is cause of al this fayte. and if ever I may have him I
shall make dogs devour him. and also both ye tweyne shall suffer therefore
great penite^ce Then said vyenne weeping i see well and know that ye have
ente^cyon to do to me much gryef and harm and I see well that my life shall not
long endure: Therefore I swear to you in good faith that there is no man in
the world that i so much love as I do him whom ye so menace and thretene /
For in him i have my thought and courage without ever to faylle him: and if ye
shortly give to me my penance. so much shortly shall be my death. And if ye
suffer me to endure it long. so much more shall i here it / and my soul shall
be the more sure to fore almighty god: and know ye for certain that for him
and his love I am ready to deye: Then the doulphyn issued out of the chamber
in great indignacyon / and commanded that the fader of Paris should be put in
an evil prison. and that all his goods should be taken fro him. And also that
vyenne and ysabeau should be enclosed in a chamber / and that well litel mete
should be given to them and much he menaced and thretened the^ and thus they
abode a long time in that chamber / and continuelly Vyenne dremed of paris.

And when vyenne might have any space to speak to Edward fellow of Paris / she
required him that he should search if he might have any tidings of paris and
that he should let her knew thereof

In this manner vyenne passed her time in great sorrow and in great thought
allewaye desyring for to here some tidinges of yt noble knight paris

When the noble and fair vyenne had be^ a great time in this manner The
doulphyn by thought him that then his daughter Vyenne had been well castysed:
And then the Doulphyn fader of vyenne ordained that she came out of the
prison And then^e he purposed to give to her an husbond and set her in her
first estate. where of all the court was much joyous and in especy all Edward
fellow of paris.

And after certain time the Doulphyn wrote to the Earl of Flanders that he
would do marye his daughter vyenne: whereupon he required him that he would give
to him cou^ceyll in this matter For it was unto him chargeable. And during the
time that vyenne was out of prison her heart was never in rest / but ever she
was heavy and soroufull for her sweet and faithful friend paris whom she might
not see / and knew not whether he were deed or a live: And wha^ the doulphin
saw her so heavy / on a day he said to her: My sweet doughtere wherefore be ye
so sorouful: give your self to plaisir / for as to me I remember no more the
things passed And there is no thing in the world that ye demand me. but I
shall do it gladly for you / And then the fair vye^ne which had not forgeten
Paris. said to hi^ Honorable fader if I were sure of the things passed that
they were forgoten by you i should be more sure tha^ I am but I believe fermely.
that ye have the^ yet in your remembrance. for ye hold always messyre jacques
in prison the fader of paris. Which is not coulpable of any part of this deed
ne cause / And if ye would do to me so much grace that ye would perdo^ne him
and re^dre to him al his goods and things I should be much joyous / and the
dolphin for the plaisir of his daughter said to her that it well playsed to him:
and inco^tiue^t the dolphi^ did do deliver messyre jacques out of pryso^ / and
did do return to hi^ al his goods and things that had be taken from him
Whereof messyre Jacques had great playsit for if he had abyde^ le^ger i prison he
had be deed for hunger. for there was none that comforted hi^ but edward: which
conforted hi^ the best wise he might / and gaf to him daily that which was
necessary for his life / when vye^ne knew that messire jacques was out of
prison she was much ioyeful and had great plaisir / nevertheless all the
consolacyo^ of vye^ne was wha^ she might speak wit edward of her love paris.
and thus she passed her time in right great pain and heaviness the best wise
she might

Wha^ the Earl of flanders had read the letters of the dolphin and understood
that he would marye his daughter vye^ne. which was of the age of xv. year. he
trayted that she should have of two barons that one. that is to were / the sone
of the king of england or the sone of the duke of bourgoyne / which then had
great renomee i france: and that was for the great promise that was in him /
and the said erly made this said traytie. and se^te words unto the doulphin
that hi^ seemed best that the sone of the duc of bourgoyn were best for her.
because that it should be great playsit to the king of france: and that he was
a noble knight and of great prowess. and wha^ the dolphi^ had received these
letters fro therle of flaundres / he sent to the king of france to wit of
him which should best playse him of these two prices a fore said that should
have his daughter For whom that he would should have her / whereof the king had
great playsit / and reputed it to him great honor / And he se^te to him word.
that it should playse hi^ best that he married with the sone of the duc of
bourgoyn his nevew. and i^ so doing he should do to him right great playsit /
and would do as much for him. Wha^ time and place requires: And seeing the
doulphyn the will of the king of france / sent word to therle of flaunders.
that he had cou^seylled with his barons. and also that it was the will of the
king of france that his doughtere should be married to the sone of the duc of
bourgoyne And then^e therle labored so much i^ this matter that he mad the
said sone of the duc to agree as for his party

How Paris sent a letter to his felawe Edward.
NOw late us leave to speak of this matter / and returned we unto paris / which
abode in the cite of Gene much heavy / and whiles this marriage was in trayry.
Paris dwelled in Gene out of all joys and playsau^ces worldy. and all for the
love that he had to the fair vyenne / whom he had somoche at his heart And
abode all way in his lodgyng allone / and by came so devout and so humble
toward god / that it was great meruaylle: and also for the good cou^tenau^ces
that he made: he was much well beloved of all the nobles and the people of the
cite / and they held him for a noble man. and said he must needs be the sone
of a great lord / and paris being in this manner had great desire to have
tydinges of vyenne and what was her adventure And anon ordained two letters.
that one to his fader. and that other to his felawe Edward / Of which the
letter to his fader said in this manner

Right dear and honorable sit and fader playse if you to wete that i am much
sorrowful and heavy of my cruel aduentur. and also I endure great heaviness. sorrow
and aff^ictyon. doubtyng that form ye have suffered great pain and tribulacyo^

deposed fro all joys and consolacyons mondayne For mine ente^dement is to serve
god and our ladi fro hens forth. and purpose that ye shall see me no more. for i

fader I pray you and supply. that my dear brother and fellow Edward ye will
take in my name and place. and that he be recommaunded as your sone instede of
me. as well in your heritage as in other things. and the grace of the holy
ghoost be with you Reco^maunde me to my mother etc.

And the letter of Edwaerd said thus.

Dear and specyal brother and singular friend Edward the peril of paris and of
his adventure is poursyewed of all evil and cruel fortune. I commau^de me to
you as much as I may say or thynk / Nevertheless like as we have be^ acustomed
to write letters of love and of cheualrie Now I must write letters anguysshous
of sorrow and of evil fortune. for alas i am unhappy all allone in a strange
country and exyled fro all joys and fro all plaisir. and out of al worldly
plaisaunce. thinking night and day on the bele vyenne / the which i think that
for me has suffered mortal sorrow and I say to you that if i knew that for me
she suffered pain and sorrow. i should be in despayr / for i am worthy for to be
punysshed cruelly. for that fair and none other Wherefore I pray god and all
his saints that she may be kept from all evil / and give her grace to
prospere in all good and honor like as she is worthy and mine heart desires

Aly dear brother and felawe the most dear things that I love in this world is
first the fair and sweet vye^ne and next you: to who^ i pray you if it may be
in any wise that ye will say her in my name / how that i am living i^ Genes /
passing my life much heavy and sorouful forth absence of her noble person / and
for the cruel and evil fortune that has pourfie wed me: and also say ye to
her that i cry her mercy. and that it may plaise her to pardonne me If by me
she have any displaysir and god knows mine entencyon and in what tribulacion i
live And sith that it has not playsed to our lord. that we accomplysshe not
our desire and will. we ought to bear it patiently / And also ye shall say to
her that I pray and supplye her as much I may that she yet take no husbonde
unto the time that she shall see the end of our adventure / and after this I
pray you dear brother of the consolacion of my fader and my mother. and that ye
be to them as a sone / For seeing the love that always we have had together. I
have wryso^ to my fader / that i^ the stead of me he take you for his sone /
and that after his life: he will leave to you his heritage: for so much brother
and felawe i pray byseche you that ye be to them humble and obeissaunt. and
the better perte shall be youres: and if by adventure ye write to me any let
late the letter be kept in my faders house. the holy ghoost have you in his
keeping / and he delyuerd this letter to a courtour which within few days was
at vye^ne: and secretly delyuerd his letters to Edward the good knight: When
edward had received these letters / and knew that paris was a live / he had
right a great joy as any man could think or believe Nevertheless he held the
coutrout secretly in his hows / to the end that the doulphin should not know
thereof. and when he had herd the letters / he went to the house of messyre
Jacques the fader of the noble paris and said to him. Messyre jacques I bring to
you this letter and when messyre jacques had read the letter. he could not be
saciat of redyng: he took so great playsir therein: After that he had read it
at his playsir. he prayed Edward to write to hi^ an answer well at large of all
that was byfallen sith his departing. and this done / edward departed fro him
and went unto beale vienne. whom he fond much heavy and soroufull for her
love and friend paris / And Edward said / honorable lady and how is it that ye
be thus heavy: and vyenne said to hi^ / alas fair brother Edward I have good
reason and cause to be heavy For mine heart abides thinking day and night on my
good knight paris. and I know not whether he be a live or deed / of which
thing / i much desire to know: for if he be deed I am cause thereof and
certes if he be deed i may not live after him. if our lord would do so much
grace / that he be a live. fayn would I know in what land he is: to the^de
that i might se^de to him a little money: so that he have no necessyre for his
person And Edward said to her: Madame what will ye give me if i tell to you
good tydinges and sure of him / Then^e said vyenne by my faith there is no
thing that i have in this world / which I may give with mine honor. but that I
shall give it to you / Then^e said edward. loo here is a letter which he has
se^te to me / and wha^ vye^ne saw the letter she opened it and read it al
allo^ge / and when she had read it / she had so great joy that her seemed god
had appyered to her: and the joy y^ she had in her heart: she wed well in her
vysage. For sithe yt she departed fro paris / she had not so good vysage ne
chere as she had then^ and wha^ the solace had enough e^dured. edward said to
her / Aladame give to me ageyn my letter. that I may make to hi^ an answer: And
Vyeune said. It pleseth me much that ye make to paris my sweet friend an
answer / but surely the letter shall remain wit me. then he said. madame have
ye not promise to give to me that thing that I shall demand you / yes said she
/ Then^e edward said I desire ne will have none other thing but that ye give
to me my letter. sir as soon shall i give to you my life. but and if ye will
demand any other thing / I will well Then^e said Edward I am co^tente that
the letter abide with you and after he ordained an other letter to Paris. which
said in his manner

How Edward sent answer of his letter to paris. which abode i^ the cite of
Genes
Right dear brother friend and felawe paris / your fader and your mother great
you well / the which have suffered for you much disease / pain and
displaysit. and in especyal your fader: which has long been in prison / and
all his goods were taken fro him / and also I certefye you that by the grace
of god and at the request and prayer of vyenne the dolphin has prodo^ned him
all his evil will / and deliuerd hi^ out of prison and restored to him all
his goods ageyn. And plese it you to wete fair brother that vye^ne has had
so much joy and plaisir wha^ she had knowleche that ye were a live / that hit
is wonder to believe For all her consolacio^ was to have tydinges of you / and
she recommau^deth her to you as much as she may / and has much great desire
to see you. and also prayed you not to wythdrawe you fro her ne fro that
co^treye / but that ye write often to her of your estate / and sends to you an
eschau^ge of three thousand fsoryns of which she will that ye take your playsit
and yoye. for all her hope is in you / Also ye shall understand that she has be
kept in prison a certain time. But thanked be god she is now out: Also i have
showed to her your letter / which she receives / and after that she had read
it. I might never have it ageyn. But she said: that she had lever to lose all that she had / than the said lettere: and ye shall know that the doulphin
treats a marriage for her / the which is the sone of the duc of bourgoyn /
and he hops fro day to day / that it shall be acco^plysshed. Nevertheless I
trust so much in vye^ne. seeing that which she has said to me. that she
will never have other husbond but you / wherefore live ye forth joyously in
hope: Dear brother i thank you as i can or may for the representacio^ that ye
have done for me your soul be with god. to whom i pray that he keep you i^
his holy ward and protectyon. etc / Wha^ this letter was wryte^ / he delivered
it to the courour which made hasty journeyes so that he arrived at genes /
where as the god knight paris dwelled and abode. Wha^ the noble paris had read
the letter / and knew that vye^ne had bee^ in prison / almoost for sorrow he
was out of his wit cursyng his evil fortune / and after he cursed the day
that he was borne. and much discomforted him self: and also he cursed the
daulphyn sayng. O euel fader and uncunning. how may your heart suffer to put in
prison her that is so noble a creature / which is full of all virtues. that is
the fair vyenne: which is no thing cause of this fayte. For I my self only
have done it / and ought to bear allone the penance. alas and wherefore did
not god to me so much grace. / that I had be taken instead of her: O fair
vye^ne what have i do for you. which have suffered so much pain for me: Thus
he made a great while his sorwe i weeping strongely / After paris saw that the
fair vye^ne was returned in to her first estate whereof he was much joyyous /
and wha^ he had received these eschau^ge that vye^ne has sent him he hired a
much fair house and cladde hi^ honestly and tycheli. and took acquaintance and
amytye wit the grettest and best of the cite / in so much they did hi^ much
good and honor: and thus dwelled paris a great while. always reme^bryng in his
heart the love of vye^ne / for alleway his love e^creaced and every month they
wroth letters each to other: of which here is made no me^cyo^. for it should be
over long to reherce. and torn we here in to flau^dres / for the fayte of the
marriage of the excellent vye^ne

How the dukes sone of bourgoigne came to have vyenne in marriage
THy storye says now that: when therle of Flaunders had accorded the marriage
with the duc of bourgoygne he made ready his sone and apparaylled hi^ of
company and of horses / and let it be known to the daulphin that he should
make ready al thing necessary / and that he should hastily send to him his
sone. Wha^ the daulphi^ herd these tidings: that he / whom he somoche
desired should come. he was much joyous. and inco^tine^t did do make ready
many great and meruayllous festes and during the same / did do make ready his
sone the duc of bourgoygne horses and people for to acco^panye hi^ which was a
fair thing to see. And after sent him to therle of flanders / which received
him with great joye and with great honor and fested him two days: and
delyuerd to him his sone in his company. and sent him to the daulphin. and
when the doulphi^ knew their coming he did do make ready to receive him. and
wha^ they were by a day journeye nyghe unto vye^ne. he rode out with much
great chyualrye. and received them with much great joy and playsir. and each
made great feste to other: which were over long to recou^te. Nevertheless
tofore that the daulphyn came to the sone of the duc of bourgoygne / he and his
wife entered into the chamber of vye^ne / to whom the daulphyn said Fair
daughter it was the playsir of god that i and your mother were to gyder vij.
year without having any child / and in the viij. year / our lord comforted us
with you. in who^ we have al our affectyon: For we have neither sone ne
doughtere but only you. ne suppose never to have / so we trust that by you we
have one. It is true that so as god will and has ordained / we will assemble
you to a much honorable marriage: the which to us playseth much. For I ensure
you the daughter of the noble ki^ge of france has much desired to have him
that ye shall have. For god has endowed him wit somoch good and honor as heart
of knight may have / thus to the playsir of god of the vergyn marie. we have
made the marriage of the sone of the duke of Bourgoyngne and of you / wherefore
we pray you that thereto ye will give your good will and playsir / and also
that ye will have the marriage agreeable / Then vye^ne a^swerd to her fader
Honorable fader and lord I wot well yt this that ye e^te^de is for my well and
prouffyt But not wythstonding that I be in age for to marye. and that i^ this
marriage I should receive honor more than I am worthy. Nevertheless I shall not
yet be married for if we have not this man / if it playse god we shall have an
other as good or better And think ye not mine honorable lord / that I say this
for any excusacyon. but it is sythen xx. days that I have be evil desposed of
my person and the maladye that I have causes me to take no playsir for to be
married For I have avowed unto god never to be married to this man ne to none
other. as long as i shall be in this maladye / Then thought the dolphyn that
vye^ne said it for shamefastnes: Nevertheless he trauaylled her every day wit
fair words that she should consent to this marriage / but it auaylled nothing
all that he did: for the will of her was more in Paris than in any man of the
world

Then^e on the morn the sone of the duc of bourgoygne: and the sone of the
earl of Flaunders entered into the cite of vyenne / whereof the Daulphyn had
great. joy and plaisir: and this feste e^dured well fystene days. that they
did no thing / but dance sing and did other diverse playsirs / and during
this feste the daulphyn said to the sone of the duke of bourgoigne to the end
that he should think none evil because he abode so long or he might espouse
his doughtere: Fair sone I pray you and biseche that ye take you to playsir
and joy. and gryeue you noothynge of this long abydyng here For certain my
daughter is so seek that uneath she may speak / which does to her great
desplaisir and shame / for fayn she would be out of her chamber And then the
sone of the noble duc of bourgoyn as he shat me^te but good faith / byleued it
lightly Nevertheless the dolphyn did nothing night ne day. but admonested his
daughter one time in fair words / and an other time in meanaces. but in no
wise he could make his daughter to conse^te: And commanded that she should
nothing have but bread and water. and vienne abode one day so i^ this manner:
And all this did the dolphyn to the^de that she consent in this marriage. and
always he did to her more harm and pain / and vye^ne was always more herd and
ferther fro his desire whereof the dolphyn had much great dysplaysir / and not
without cause. and seeing the dolphyn that his daughter was so indurate: he
thought that biso^me good moyen he would sent home ageyn the sone of the duc of
bourgoyn / for he doubted that if he abode long that this feat might be
discouerd^ and he gaf to him fair jewellys and after said to him / Fair sone I
will that ye take no displaysir in that I shall say to you. Ale seems well
that at this time this marriage may not go forth of you and of my daughter / for
after that I see and as me semethe the will of god is ferther than I would at
this time For he will not that the marriage of you and of my daughter take now
effect: Wherefore I have right great displaysir in my heart only for the love
of you / Then^e the sone of the duc of bourgoygne seeing that at that time he
might do no thing took leave of the daulphyn and returned into his co^tree. by
cause that vyenne was not in health: and promised that as soon as he might know
that she should be hool / he would return for to accomplysshe the marriage: like
as the Dolphyn had promised to him

How the dolphyn did do emprysonne vyenne because that she would not consent
to the marriage to the sone of the duke of Bourgoyne

AFter certain days that the sone of the duke of Bourgoi^ was departed fro the
cite of vyenne. the doulphyn for great desplaisir that he had did do come
tofore him the master Iayler of his prison: and did do make within his paleys
alytel prison derke and obscure And he did do put vyenne and ysabeau into that
prison: and commanded that they should have nothing to ete but bread and water.
and one damoysel in whom^ the dolphin trusted bri^ge it to the^ And in this
manner vye^ne and ysabeau passed their time in great sorrow. and think not that
for this prison / the heart of vyenne would in any wise consent to the will of
her fader / but always encreaced wit her the will toward her sweet friend paris
/ and with sweet words she comforted ysabeau saying My dear suster abasshe you
not for this derkenes: for I have confydence in god that ye shall have yet much
welthe / for my fair suster it is a much rightful thing that for the good
knight paris which for me suffers so much pain that i suffer this for him.
and also i say to you that all the pains of this world be nothing grievous to
me wha^ I think on his sweet vysage / and in this manner that one comforted
that other. in speking all day of the vayllyaunt knight paris

How the sone of the duc of bourgoyn departed fro his countreye for to come see
the fair lady vyenne
When the sone of the duck of bourgoyne had abyden long time in his country /
On a day he had great thought of vynne: and that was for the great beauty of
her and it displesed him much that at his being there he had not seen her: and
so concluded to goo and see her / and it was not long after that he came to the
dolphyn / and the dolphyn received him much gladly and with great honor
Then^e prayed he the doulphyn that it might plese him to show to hi^ vienne
also seek as she was / For in the world was nothing that he so much desired
to see as her And the dolphi^ seeing the will and desire of hi^ / would not
le^ger hyde his courage. but said to hi^ My fair sone by the faith that I owe
to god. I have had great desire that this marriage should be made: but my
daughter for this present time will take no husbond ne be married / Wherefore i
have great desplaisir and that for the love of you. and to the end that ye know
that it holds not on me I swear to you that fythe ye deperted fro this town.
I have done her to be kept in a prison derke and obscure. and has ete^
nothing but bread and water oneli: and have sworn that she shall not goo out of
pryso^ till she shall consent to have you in marriage. and thus I pray you that
ye take no displaysir / if at this time ye see her not For ye may not faylle
to have great marriage. in caas that this faylle you And then^e he a^swerd
Honorable sire I pray you much herthely. sith that it is so. that er I
return I may speak to her / and I shall pray her asmoche as i mow / and shall
see if by any manner I may conuertie her fro her will. Then^ said the dolphi^
he was conte^te. Then^e he sent for his daughter clothing and vestimentes for
to clothe her / and also mete for to ete / for in two months she had ete^ but
bread and water / whereof she was much feeble: and that showed well in her visage
/ and thus he did because she should xse^te to the marriage. And then^ it was
concluded. that the sone of the duc of bourgoyn should come see her and speak
with her. and then^e when vie^ne saw this and hadreceyued all and knew that
the sone of the duc of bourgoyn should come and speak wit her. she said to
ysabeau her damoysel / Fair suster behol de how my fader and mother wene by
these vestime^tes and this hen that i should ete to deceive me and put me fro
my purpoos / but god forbid that I should do so and then she took the he^ne
and said to her that brought it: sith if playseth to the sone of the duke to
come and speak to me. say ye to him that he may not come these three days. and
when he comes that he bring wit him the bishop of saint laure^s / She that
had brought to her the hen said all this unto the doulphi^ and to dame dyane
her mother / Then vye^ne took the two quarters of the hen and put the^ under
her arm hooles and held them there so long that they sto^ke^ much stro^gely
/ And wha^ it came to the third day. the bishop of saint laurence and the
sone of the duke of bourgoyn^ came^ for to see vienne. and or they entered they
opened a treylle which gaf light into the prison Then^e when the sone of the
duc saw vienne in the prison he said to her by great pity that he had / Noble
vyenne how will ye deye thus for hu^gre so folyly by your own deffaulte / And /
know ye not well that your fader has given you to me to have to my wife.
wherefore I live i^ great pain / and in much great sorrow for the duresse of
your courage whereof ye do right great sin / and doubt ye not yt god
punyssheth you for thin obedience that ye do to your fader and to your mother.
wherefore i prayer you fair vienne to tell to me for what cause ye will not
have me in marriage to your husbo^d Doubt ye that wha^ ye shall be wit me. that
ye may not serve god as well as ye now do that suffer this pain / I promise you
by my faith that ye shall have playsau^ces and libertees i^ all the manners that
ye shall conne demand / Then^e I pray you that ye will not here deye so
dolorously / and if ye will not do it for the love of me. yet at the least do
it for ye love of your fad and of your mother: which live for you in great
sorrow and in great heaviness. wherefore ye ought to have pite on them

When vye^ne had herd these words she was all abashed and said / sir saving
/ your honor I am married how be it ye know we him not whom I have in mine
heart. ad also i know and grant right well that ye be worthy to have one
much grerter and more hye a lady than i am: and I ^^te you wete that for him
that I oes^re I should suffer more pain than I feel And therefore I pray you
that fro hens forth ye speak to me no more of this matter And also I am ^o evil
disposed i my person that if it endure in me. my life shall not be long / and
if it were honest i should show it you and than should ye see how it stondeth
with me: Nevertheless approach ye ner to me: and ye shall the better believe me.
and the sone of y^ duke of bourgoyn^ and the bishop of saint laure^ce
approached unto vye^ne / fro who^ issued so great a ste^che that uneath there
might suffer and endure it: which favor came fro under her arm holes of the
two quarters of the he^ne: which were rote^. and wha^ vie^ne saw that they had
felt enough of the stenche she said to the^ / lords ye may now know enough
in what evil adventure I am disposed. Then^ they took leave having great
compassyon on her / And they said to the doulphyn that vyenne was then half
roten and that she stanke. and demed in them self that she might not live long
And that it should be great damage of her death for the souerai^ beauty that was
in her And inco^tine^t the sone of the duc bourgoyn took his leave of the
dolphyn and returned into his country and recou^ted to his fader the life of
vienne. whereof all they that herd hi^. had great pity in their heart /

Wha^ the doulphyn saw that the marriage was broken by the deffaulte of his
daughter vye^ne. he swear that she should never deperte fro the^s. but if she
would co^sente to his will / And so she abode long time in that priso: where
she had great thought and sorrow for her sweet and true friend paris: and her
desire was on no thing but for to here tydinges of paris her love: But in the
estate that she was i^ no man might bring her tydinges. And Edward the felawe
of paris seeing that vye^ne abode in so great pain: and that none durst speak
to her he had in his heart great sorrow. and was much moeued of great pity.
and also for the great love that he had to paris: and co^ciuded to make a
chapel i^ the church that touched the palace of the dolphyn and in a corner he
did do dygge so deep that it was nyghe to the fo^dame^t of the pryso^. where in
vye^ne was: and by cause he would not have the thing disclosed: he would that
they should dygge no ferther / and when the chapel was achyeued and fynisshed /
Edward all allone dygged himself so ferze. that he made an hole: by which he
spak to vye^ne wha^ he would which cave was made so secretli that no man might
apperceyue it / So it happed on a day Edward bihelde vyenne through this hole.
and salewed her. and then^e wha^ vye^ne herd him and knew him / she had so
great joye and consolacyon / that she seemed that she was risen fro the death to
life and the first tydinges that vyenne demanded of him were if he knew any
tydinges of paris / and edward told to her that it was not long sith that he
had received a letter fro him wryton at genes. Then^e said vye^ne al weeping to
him. alas wha^ shall the day come / that I shall see him / and that done I would
be co^te^te that god should do his will of me. for none other thing I desire i^
this world Alas fair brother what seems you of my life and of this fair chamber
in which I dwell in. certeynly I believe veryli that if paris knew it / that
for his love i suffer thus much sorrow: that the heart of him should swelte for
sorrow: and after she told to edward the perlame^t y^ she had with the sone of
the duc of bourgoyn^. and also of the he^ne. and prayed hi^ that he would se^de
word of all this to paris / and yt she reco^mau^ded her to hi^. and also that
she had none other hope in this world but i^ him. Edward brought to her every
day fro then forthon mete and drink / and all that was necessary to her. for
her life / and comforted her wit fair words the best wise he might. and Edward
wrote al plai^ly to paris: hou for hu^gre she should have be^dede / ne had he
be^ / which daily pourueyed for her all that was to hinecessarye: and he wrote
to him all the manner that Vyenne has holden with the sone of the Duke of
Bourgoyne And that this fair lady vye^ne desired no thing in this world but
for to see him only: and also that she prayed that he should not depart out
of the contre that he was in.

Wha^ the noble paris had received the letter fro Edward: and knew that vpe^ne
abode in prison. it is no need to demand if he had great displaysir. and
almoost was in such caas as to lose his wit for sorrow: and on that other
part he had great dread that she should be married in eschewyng of the great
harm and pain that she suffered. and herin he was pe^syf night and day /
saying to him self I see well that I may not escape but that vyenne must needs
be married and by that moyen her love and mine shall faylle. Alas now see I well
that now me byhoueth no hope ne trust Alas cattyf and unhappy what shall
byfalle of me / I shall goo so far that fro her I may never here tidings / ne
also she fro me / and after this began ageyn his complaynte saying / O very
god of heaven whereof have thou not done to me so much grace / that i^ the stead
of her I might suffer the pain that she suffers for me: O cruel fortune full
of cruel tormente. and what has vye^ne done or made that she must suffer so
grievous penance Ha alas were it not more reason justyce and cause that I
which have done all this evil bear the punycion Certesyes.

How paris sent a letter to Edward his felawe
AFter that he had made his complaynte. he wrote a letter unto Edward: doing
him to wit how he had souerayn sorrow for vye^ne which was in pryso^ and he
thanked him of the goodness and dyly ge^ce that he had done toward her / in
prayeng him that he never would faylle her / but co^tynuelly aid and help her
with great diligence And after he wrote to him how for very displaysir and
melancolye he would goo in to sum strange co^treye. And that from than
forthon he should send to him no moo letters / and that he never retche for to
here moo tydinges fro him. no more than of a deed person. Then^e wha^ Edward
had received these letters fro Paris and knew that he would estraunge him fro
that contree of Genes / and would goo in to a strange contreye he was much
wroth and sore agryeued

And then^e inco^tine^t edward went and told it to the fader and mother of
paris / whereof they took so great sorrow that they supposed to have lost
their wit: And after Edward went and told it also to vye^ne. whereof it
needs not to demand the great sorrow that she had / for it was so great and
ouermoch. that if edward had not comforted her. she had bee^ deed And then^e
she complained to ysabeau saying that sy then she never ente^ded to here
tydinges of her love paris she was right well co^te^te to deye and that she
would never more have playsir of no thing that was in this world. and that
then she would that she were deed And if abeau comforted her always

How paris went to ship at venyse: for to goo to the holy sepulcre in
Iherusalem
AFter that paris had sent the letter to Edward: Incontinent he deperted fro
Genes wit his seruau^te / and went to venyse where he took shippyng. and
saylled so far that he came to alexa^drye. where he abode a space of time. and
after in that country he informed him and learned the way to the mount of
caluarye and of Iherusalem and how he might pass surely / And afterward paris
concluded to goo in to that country a pylg^^mage / but to fore or he took his
way. he learned for to speak the langage of moors. And when Paris could well
speak mouryske. he and his varlet took the way toward ynde / and so far
labored by their journeyes / that they arrived in the land of prester Johan:
In which he dwelled a long time: and in that while his berde grew long /
and after he took the habit of a more / and also learned all the customs and
manners the co^tree. and he had all way fast / believe in our lord Ihesu
criste and in the glorious virgyn marye his sweet mother. and thus abydyng in
this manner he had great will to goo to jherusale^ to the holy sepulture for to
see the holy santuaryes: and for taccomplysshe the holy pylgremage. Then^e when
he was in jherusalem he set all his courage in devotion and byca^so denoute
that it was meruaylle. and prayed contynuelly our lord that by the merit of
his passion he would give to him saluacyo^ of his soul / and consolacyon for
his bodi and also for the fair vyenne / and after he departed fro thens and
went in to egypt: and arrived in the country of the soudan. and his money
began to faylle: and hired him a little hows wherein he dwelled much heavy and
sorouful for his infortune. And also he had great desplaysir when he saw other
tryumphe and wexe lords Now it happed on a day that paris went to play and
disporte him out of the town in the feldes. and there met wit the faulconners
of the soudan / which came fro hawking. and emonge them was one faulcon much
seek / and that fawcon the sonda^ loved best of all the other. Then
demanded paris of the fauconner what sickness the faucon had And the
faulconner said to him that he wist not / Then^e said paris truly if he
continue in the maladye that he has he shall not live three days / but if ye
do that I shall say to you. and if he be not hole therewith he shall never be
hole / Then^ said the fawlconner to him. I pray you. that ye will tell me
what I shall do. for I ensure you faithfully. that if ye may make hi^ hole /
it shall mow auaylle you and me also / and that I promise you for the souldan
had lever lose the best cite that he has. than this fawlcon:: Then^e paris
went and sought certain herbs: and gaf them to the faulconner and bad him to
bind the^ to the feet of the faulcon / and so he did / and sone after the
faulcon amended and beca^ as hole as ever he had be tofore Whereof the souldan
was much joyous / and for love of this faulcon / the soudan made the fawlconner
a great lord in his court. Then the faulconner seeing that by the moyen of
paris he had gotten his lordship: he did to him much playsir / and showed to
him as great amytye and frendshyp as he had been his brother / and brought him
in the grace of the soulda^. and was received in to his court. and the souldan
loved him so well that he gaf to him great office / and mayntened hi^ in great
honor.

Ye shall understand that in this time reigned a much holy pope. the which
was named Innocencyus / and was a much holy person and devout And it pleased
so him that he gaf out a croysee. against the false myscreauntes and he then
men. to the end that the name of our lord Ihesu christ were more santefyed and
enchau^ced through out all crystyente. and therefore was maade a great cou^ceyl
emo^ge the cardynals and prelates. and was concluded by their parliament. that
this croysee should be wryton to the king of france and to other kings
christian dukes / Earls / and other great lords. and so was it don

How the doulphyn came toward the king of France
When the king of France had received the letters fro the pope / Incontyne^
the sent for the daulphyn of vye^noys / that he should come and speak with him
/ The which incontinent came at his commau^deme^t. Then^ the king said to him
Sir godefroy we have made you to come hither. for ye be one of the most wysest
of our court / and also ye be of our lygnage. and we late you wete that our
holy fad the pope has wryton to us that he had yeuen a croysee against the
mescreau^tes. where fore we for the love and reverence of god ente^de for to goo
thither. Nevertheless we have advised that ye should goo first into thoo parties
and we pray you for the love and reverence of god that ye take on you the
charge for to espy the contrees. and also the passages. Then the doulphyn
said. I am ready and appareilled to do your commandment with good will. But
how shall I mow do it for to pass surely emonge the hethe^ people: For if they
apperceyue in any wise that I goo for to espy their coun^^ee. I shall not conne
escape. but that I must deye by cruel death if god keep me not. Then^e said the
king / ye may goo and your company surely clothed i^ habyte of pylgryms / for
ye know well yt this is not the first time that many christian men have bee^ in
the holy land. Wherefore I pray you yet eft ones that in the name of jhesu
christ that ye make you ready for to goo thither. and take with you of our
kinghtes as many as it shall playse you Then^e the doulphyn seeing the will of
the king. and that inco^tine^t he must depart: he sent letters to his wife /
that he would good i^ to the holy land / to seche the holy sayntuatyes and
pylgrimages. and prayed her that she much wisely should govern his land: and
that vyenne his daughter should not escape out of prison. till he returned /
For in short time he would come ageyn

How the doulphyn took his shippynge for to goo in to Iherusalem
AFter that the doulphin had taken his ship. and passed in to Surye and
damask / to jherusalem and in many other places. and had aduysed and espied
much wisely and well all the country / And inquired of the cryste^ me^ that
dwelled there many things. without discoueryng his will and entente.
Nevertheless some evil cryste^ me^ for get money told it unto the souldan of
babylone. Then when the sowlda^ knew it / he maad no semblaunte. but i^
co^tine^t he made all the passages to be kept where as the pylgri^s went by in
such manner as the doulphyn was taken and all his company wit him in place
called Ramo^ not far fro Iherusalem Which was brought tofore the soulda^.
and he ordained that the doulphyn should be tormented and pyned. The doulphin
seeing him self in such a point said that they should not tormente him: and he
would say to them the truth And thus he recounted to the soulda^ how the pope
had given out a croysee against them and how he was comen to espy the contreye
When the soudan saw this: he said that he would advise hi^ of what death he would
do him to death ^n manner that all other should take ensaumple. And commanded
that anon he should be led in to alexandrye. and there to be put into an herd
prison. and alsoo that none should give to hi^ but bread and water Then the
doulphyn was brought in to alysandrye / and was put into an hard and strong
toure. and there he suffered a miserable life and had kepars that kept hi^ night
and day Thus was the doulphi^ in great sorrow thi^king never to issue out of
that prison but deed Nevertheless the pope and the king of France did often
times great pain to have him out by fynau^ces / but they might not have him.
For the soulda^ said that he should do on hi^ such punycio^ that all other
should take ensaumple / Now late us leave to speak of the doulphyn and return we
to paris that knew no thing of these tydinges

Now recounteth thistorye that paris was in babylone like as ye have to fore
herd / which knew no thing of this fayte So it happed that by adventure.
ij. freres relygyous sought thindulgences of the holy land and arryuede^ i^
babylone. where they would see the seygnourye and the puyssau^ce of the sowldau.
For then^e the sowldan held him in babylone wit much great puissaunce These
two freres were of these parties / which being in tho parties it happed as
they went in the town paris fo^de them / Then^ paris salewed them / and
demanded of these parties and said to the^ in this manner. After that I have
herd say emonge you christian men ye have a pope. the which is much strong and
puyssau^t. and also ye have many kings and great lords / and so great towns
cytees and castellys. that I have merueyll how ye suffer that we that be not of
your law have the seygnourye of the holy land. which ought to apperteyne to
you as ye say / And wha^ the freres had herd paris thus speak. they were sore
aferde / and one of them answered in the la^gage of moure / For they wist none
other but paris was a moure / and so did al they of the country. and he said to
him. Sir I believe well that ye have herd say: yt in our parties been assembled
great company of people and men of war / for to come into these parties /
because that our holy fadere the pope has granted out a croysee: and in the
time whiles our men of war assebled. the king of france. which is the
grettest of crystye^te: sent a noble baron / which is named the doulphi^ of
vyennoys: for to vysite and espy these parties. The soulda^ set men in such
places: where as the pylgri^s were acustomed to pass. and sodeynli he did to
take him in a cite named Ramon / and after sent him into alexa^drye. and there
set him in an evil prison / wherein I suppose that he be deed / and thus for
this cause the fayt was discouerd Then^ said paris / how is yt lord named Then^
said the friar / he is named godefroy of Allaunson doulphyn of vyennoys / and
when paris herd this he was much abashed but he made no semblaunter. and
thought in his heart. that his adventure might yet come to good and effect.
Then^ he demanded the^ of many things / and said to them. that he would more
speak to them an other time: and demaundet the^ where they were lodged: and
they told him more for dread tha^ for love / for they thought he would have
done to the^ some harm

When paris was deperted fro the freres. he was much pensyf how and in what
manner he might goo into alexandrye for to see the doulphin / and how he might
get him out of prison. and so much he thought on his fayte: that he purposed
to goo to the hostry where the freres were lodged and so went thither. and
when the freres saw him they were sore aferde / Then^ paris took them by the
hands / and ladde the^ to solace through the cite spekyng of many things
always in the langage of moure and said to them / I have great desire to see
that christian knight which is in alexandrye For I have always had good will to
the christian men. peradventure I might yet well help him / and if ye will come
with me / I promise you by my law / that I shall make you good chere: and
doubt ye nothing. and then^ when the freres herd him thus speak they wist not
what to answer. they had so great fere. Nevertheless they trustyng in the mercy
of god / they promised him. that they should deye and prayden god in their
courage that he would grant grace that he might come out of prison: Then
paris had great play six of the answer of the freres and we^de never to see the
hour that he might be with to see the doul phyn for to see the end of his
adventure / And so departed fro the freres. and went strayte to the faulconner
of the sowldan / with whom he had great knowleche and said to him / Seygnour I
thank you of the great honor / curtosye and gentylnes that ye have do to me
and pla^se yt you to wit that I will deperte / to hens into alexandrye. and I
promise to you that for your love I shall not tarry long / but that i shall
return hytheyr ageyn And because I am there unknown and that i never was
there: i may you right humbly that I might have a maundement of the souldan.
that he command to the governors that I may goo through all his lord
surely / For ye know well that one may not keep him over well fro evil people
Therefore i pray you and require that ye will get me such a maundement and
also that ye will commau^de me humbly to the good grace of my lord the souldan /
and for with the faulco^ner went to the soulda^ / and made his req^ste for
Paris / and incontine^t the sowldan granted him al his desire: saying that it
much displaysed him of the depertyng of paris. and if he would abide and dwell
in his court / he would make him a great lord. Then the fawlconner said
Dear sir he has promised me / that in short time he shall return / Then the
souldan did do make the mau^deme^t like as he would deuyse. charchyng al his
lords officers and subgettes of towns cytees and castellys of his land. that
they should do to hi^ great honor: and yt they should give and deliver to him
all that should be necessary to hi^ without taking any money or any other thing
of hi^ And also the soulda^ gaf to paris many rich clothes and vestime^tes of
cloth of gold and of sylke. and also he gaf to hi^ great tresour. praye^g him
yt he should not long tarry / but hastily return ageyn: and promised him that
he should make hi^ a great lord / and delyuerd his mau^dement / the which was
sealed wit the propre seal of the sowldan: and sygned with his own hand

How paris with two freres went into Alexa^drye. where he was worshypfully
received of Thadmyrall
WHa^ paris had received all these things that the soulda^ had given to hi^ he
took leave of him and of his court and went wit the freres into Alexandrye.
Incontinent after he was comen / he showed the mau^deme^t to the admyral. the
which anon he had see^ it. did great honor to paris / and delyuerd to hi^ a
fair loggyng pourueyed of all things necessary. and delyuerd an other to the
freres. Thadmyral came eueri day to see paris in his logyng for to do hi^
honor and company / and went and rode together through the cite. and because
yt paris was rychely clad / every man made to hi^ great honor and said that he
seemed well to be the sone of sum great moure / And on a day as they rode in
the cite / they passed forth by the toure where as the doulphi^ was in prison.
Then^e paris demanded of the admyrall what toure it was yt was so fair.
Then^e he told to him that it was a much cruel prison and terryble In which
the sowldan held a prysonner a great lord and baron of the theste / which was
comen for tespye these co^treyes / Then^e, said paris I pray you late us goo
see him: and the admyral said he should gladly Then^ they alyghted fro their
horses. and entered in to the prison. and when paris saw the doulphyn be had in
his heart great desplaysir: because of the miserable and forouful life that he
suffered And paris demanded of the kepars what man he was. and they said. that
he was a great baron of france / Then^ said paris. vndersto^deth he mourisshe
/ and they say nay: but that notwithstondyng if he would speak to him / that
they shol find tourcheme^ enough. Then^e said paris he would return an other
day: for to demand of him of the parties of the weste. and prayed thadmyral
to give commandment to the kepars / that as often as he should come that they
should show him to him: and inco^tine^t he commanded like as paris has
desires. and then^e they departed / and a few days after paris returned and
came to the pryso^ and brought one of the freres wit him that could speak
mouryske / and when they were within prison. paris said to the friar that he
should salewe him curtoyssy Nevertheless the friar knew no thing that Paris
could speak frensshe Then^e the friar said to the Doulphyn. that that lord was
come for to vysite him. and that he loved well christian men / and that he was well
in the grace of the sowldan: and that he trusted as much in him as in any man
of his contreye / and thus the friar demanded many things of the doulphin in
ye name of paris and said if he might do for hi^: he would gladly.

When the doulphyn herd the religyous friar thus speak in the person of yt
moure. he was much abashed in his courage. bysechyng our lord that he would
put him in such courage and good will for to bring hi^ out of prison. Paris
desired of here tydinges of the fair vye^ne said to the friar that he should
ask to the dolphi^ if he had any wife or children / Then^ the dolphyn began to
weep / and said yt he had a wife / and a daughter holden for the fairest of
France. whom he held in prison because she would take no husbond: Then
paris began to comfortee him by the mouth of ye friar: saying that he should
take all in pacye^ce / and god should yet ones deliver him out of prison / by
which words ye doulphin was so reyoyced and joyous that him seemed yt god had
appyered to him / and the dolphyn said to ye friar that it was great pity that
the moure was not cryste^: and prayed our lord yt he would give to hi^
puyssau^ce to keep him in yt good will yt he had and so deperted that one from
that other much comforted Then^ paris said to ye kepars yt he had found so
great plaisir in the prisoner yt he would often times come for to disporte him:
and they said wha^ it plaised hi^ he should return and be welcome: and then^e
paris said to ye friar that were i^ yt place yff i thought to be sure of you: i
think well to find moyen to bring this prysonner out of prison. and the
freres were much admerueylled of this / which paris had said to them and they
said to hi^ / by the says that we owe to our god that of us ye need not to
doubt. and in caas that ye be in will late us assaye / but it must be done
secretly. For ye see well how many kepars bee^ there continuelly: Then^e said
paris I shall give to you good cou^ceyl and remedy of all this. but I will
have / ij. things / The first thing is. I will that ye goo with me / That
other is. that he shall give to me my living honorably in his country / for I
am in great doubt wha^ i have delyuerd him: and shall be in his cou^treye that
he will set naught by me: and I can no mestyer ne craft. and so I might be
well deceived. Therefore if he will assure me / and that he will give to me a
yefte: such as I shall demand him when I shall be in his cou^treye / i shall
deliver him and shall leave my country for love of him / and ye may see in what
estate I am

On the morn paris and the freres came into the pryso^ / and the friar
recou^ted all this to the doulphyn. and when the doulphin / understood this. him
thought that god bare him away: and said. I thank you and this moure of the
good will yt he has to ward me: For I never did him service ne playsir
Wherefore he ought to do so much for me: Nevertheless I hope yt it is the
playsir of god that he shall deliver me out of prison: i am ready to swear upon
the body of Ihesu christ: or i ever depart from he^s / that asson^ as I shall be
in mine own land i shall mayntene hi^ in more great estate tha^ he is here /
and I will that he do all his will of my land / for it shall suffyse to me
only / that I have a living for me and my wife. and I shall do all that he
will. and so say to him on my behalue. And then^e the friar told al to paris
that which the dolphi^ had said and promised to do. and to the^de that paris
should be more sure he said to the friar that he should bring to fore him the
bodi of our lord jesu christ / and that to fore him he should swear to hold all
that he promsed and the friar told it to paris. and the doulphyn swear it to
paris / to accomplisshe all that he had promised / and when he had sworn to
the end that Paris should be the better conte^te. the dolphyn received the
precious body of our lord Ihesu christ / saying that it should be to the
damnacyo^ of his soul / in caas that he acco^plysshed not all that he had
promised wha^ they should be in his land, and wha^ this was do / paris and
the freres deperted fro te doulphyn: and went to the port: for to wit if
there were any fuste that would come hytherward / and by adventure they fond a
fuste. and paris with the freres spoke to the patron. and promised him a. M.
besau^ts of gold if they would let have passage five persons. The patron seeing
the great tresour / said to them that he was co^tente: but he would have half at
the port: and said to them / lords I pray you make you ready For in caas yt
the moure of this land fond us we should be al deed Then^e said Paris make
your self al ready. for this night at midnyght I shall come: And after this Paris
returned to his loggyng and did do make ready much vytaylle and the best wynes
that he could get and he with the freres maad prouysyon of all other things
and mantellys and to wellys

How that the doulphyn was delyuerd by paris out of prison
THan al was ready paris went to the kepars of prison and said I thank you
many times of the great playsirs that ye have done to me I will now depart fro
hens / for to return to my lord the Sowldan. But for your love I will souppe
with you this night / and pray you that we may soupe to gydere / And they
answered. that it well pleased the^ for his love. Then^ Paris sent for the
vytaylle and for the wyn. and after it was come they souped to gyder / and the
kepars which had not been accustomed to drink wyn: drank so much that they
all were dronken. and incontinent leyed them down to sleep. and slepte so
fast. that for no thing they could awake them / and when paris saw that: he
said to the freres: that they should opene the yates of the prison / and if any
of the kepars awake / I shall slay him Then the freres began to vnfetere the
doulphi with great dread. praye^g god to be their ande and help / and wha^ the
doulphyn was loos he cladde hi like a moure / After paris slew all the kepars
one after an other because if they awoke they should not come after them

Now the doulphyn. paris. and the ij. freres went to ship
This done the dolphin with paris and his varlet and the two freres camen to
the port / and hastily entered into the fuste which was al ready / and wonde up
their sail. and by the help of god began so fast to saylle that with in few
days they arryuede^ i^ a place that then^ was christian: and there the dolphyn
went alonde by cause he was much grieved and annoyed as well of the sea as for
the harm that he had suffered in prison. and there borrowed money and fro the^s
came into cypers where was a king which had dwelled in the court of the king
of france The which as soon as he knew that the dolphyn of vyennoys was come
he went to mete him and prayed him that he would come and lodge in his paleys /
and the dolphyn went thither. Whereof the king had great joye: and there he made
hi great chiere. for many times they had seen each other in the kings court of
France And after the king demanded him of his adventure / and the doulphyn
recou^ted it to him al alonge. and. because of the coming of the doulphi he
made much great feste and received him much hyely. and made him to soyourne
there as long as it pleased him: and when the doulphyn had soyourned there at
his plaisir: he took leave of the king and of al his court / tha^king him moch^
of the great playsir that he had done to him The king seeing yt the dolphyn
would depart: he gaf to him great yestes: and did do arm two galeyes which
accompanied him. and brought him upon the sea: and had so good wind that in
few days after they brought him in to aygue smortes

How the doulphyn and paris were receyud with joy and gladness of the people
of france
THan the doulphyn was arrived / the knights of the doulphyne herd it anon /
and forthwith maad them ready and went to horsback and mete with him at
ayguesmortes / and there received him in great honor / and so came forth the
right way to vyenne. and for yoye his coming / all they of the cite made a
much noble and meruayllous feste / which endured well fyftene days / and the
playsir and joye was so great emonge the^ because they had recounerd their lord
/ that no man should and could have thought it / Paris in all this wise never
changed his vesture ne clothing. but co^tinuelly went to mass. and by the
commau^deme^t of the doulphi / the people did him great reverence and honor.
so moch^ that paris was ashamed thereof: and spoke no thing but mouryske: and
he had a great berde. and made to no person of the world any knowleche / and
after a while of time. the doulphin for tac complysshe that he had promised to
paris by the friar did do say to paris and demand / if he would have the
seygnourye of his land and contree For he was al ready for taccomplysshe that.
which he had promised. And paris made to him answer that he should keep stylle
his land. Then^ the doulphyn did do demand him (...) he would have his
daughter vye^ne (...) paris mad the friar to say / ye for that pleased him well
/ and then^e they went to her. Then^e wha^ they were to fore Vyenne / the
friar spoke first / Madame ye know well that my lord your fader has been a
great while in prison: and yet should have been: ne had have been this moure /
which has saved him / puttyng his person in right great perpl and danger for
the love of milord your fad. and thus ye may well know how much he is holden to
him / and by cause hereof your fader is subget to him ever. wherefore your fader
prays you. that upon all the playsir that ye will do for him. that ye will
take hi^ for your husbond And he shall pardo^ne all the desplaysir that ever ye
did to him Wha^ the friar had fynysshed his words vyenne a^swerd to him saying
The bishop of saint laure^ce knows well that is here p^sent / that it is
long sith / that if I would have be married I might have been married with more
honor unto my fader / tha^ unto this moure. for the sone of the duc of
bourgoyne had espoused me if i would have co^se^ted / but god has put me in
such a maladye: that I may not long live in this world and every day my
maladye encreaceth and so enpayreth me that I am half roten / Wherefore I pray
you to say to my fader that he hold me excused. for at this time I will not be
married Then^ they took their leave of vye^ue and recounted all this to the
dolphyn. Then^e the doulphyn said to the friar that he should say it to the
moure / and so the friar told it al to paris / and then^e paris which was
aferde to lose the love of vienne / went for to see her in the prison with the
friar and the bishop of saint laure^ce. Then^e wha^ paris saw vye^ne in that
disposicyon he had much great sorrow and great meruaille / and then^ he made
the friar to salewe her in his name / and vye^ne a^swerd unto his gretyng
curtoysly. and the friar said in the name of paris / madame ye know well i have
delyuerd your fader out of the pryso. Whereof ye ought to have singular play
sir: and yet he should have been there if I had not helped him out / and he
perdonneth you with good heart and good will all the desplaysirs that ever ye
did against his playsir And prays you that ye take me for / your husbond and
will that we have the lordship of the doulphyne. and therefore I pray you yt
neither ye nor I lose not this honor: and yet more though this were not / ye
ought not to disobeye the conmaundeme^tes of your fader. And then^e vienne
a^swerd to the friar as to the person of paris saye^g. i know well that ye
have delyuerd my fad out of prison. Not withsto^ding my fader shall have such
regard against you that ye shall lose no thing. And I wot well yt ye be a man
of great lygnage. and are whorthy to have a gretter lady tha^ i am But the
bishop of saint laurence which is p^se^t knows well that for the maladye that
i am in: I may not long line. and then^e said the friar i^ this name this is
because I am a moure that ye refuse me: I promise you that i shall become
cryste^: but I think well that if ye knew who that I am and what i have left
for to bring your fader out of pryso^ that ye would preise me more tha^ ye do
/ know ye for certain yt your fader shall be perjured for he has promyseth yt
ye shall be my wife. whereof ye shall have blame. therefore if it plaise you
grant ye him his will / Then^e said vyenne / lord have herd say much good of
your: and that ye be he that have done somoche for my fader. but nevertheless in
the maladye in the which I am none ought to cou^ceyl me to take an husbond /
for my life may not long endure / and by cause that ye may know that I say
trouht approce ye ner to me: and ye shall feel and smelle in what disposicio^ i
am: of my person. and then^e they approuced ner to her. and vye^ne had put.
ij. quarters of an he^ne under her two arm hooles / and there issued so great
ste^che that the bishop ne ye friar might not suffer it: Nevertheless ye
slynche was to paris a good odor. for he smelled it not. and said I wot not
what ye smelle / for I feel none evil savor / and they meruaylled stro^gely
because he felt not the odor. and the friar said in paris name / For this
odor shall I never leave you and i assure you i shall never deperte fro he^s.
until ye have consented to yt your fader will / and vye^ne a^swerd much
a^grely and said: by the faith yt i owe to god i shall rather re^ne wit my head
against the wall yt shall make my brai^ issue out of my mouth / and so shall ye
be the occasion of my my death / Then^ said the friar ye shall not so do madame:
For i promise you fro he^s forth. that i shall never speak more to you. sithe yt
it is not your will ne playsir / but at lest of one thing i pray you that
this night ye advise you / and i shall return to morn for to have of you an
answer / and ye shall take cou^ceyl of your fellow. and i pray to god yt ye may
be well cou^ceylled / and all these things said the friar i the name of paris
to vye^ne. and after they took their leave of vye^ne / and said all to the
doulphin / whereof he was then^ much displeased: bad the friar to tell it all
unto paris for to excuse hi^ and that he should not leye the blame on him. And
when they were deperted fro vye^ne she said to ysabeau / My sayr suster what
seems you of ye wisdom of my fader. that thinks yt I should take this moure
to my husbo^d and have refused the sone of the duke of bourgoyn^ / but god
forbede that ever in my life i have other lord tha^ paris to mine husbond: whom
I hope yet to have. and ysabeau said Tertes madame I wot not what to say of
your fader which would give you to a moure in marriage. I have thereof great
thought: for he has said that he shall return to morn^ to see you. and has
said that ye should remember and advise you

How paris came to see vye^ne in the prison and how she knew him


ANd on the morn^ betymes paris cladde him much more rychely than to fore. and
gyrde with a much rich sword. and came to the prison with the friar / and
the friar said to her / Madame we been returned for to know your god answer
and your ente^cyon / And vyenne answered. lords mine entencyo^ is that I shall
never break my promise that I have made / For I have avowed that I shall never
take husbond ne goo owte of this prison / but deed / sauf him. to whom I have
promised and therefore return ye in good time Then^e said the friar. by my
faith I wot not what to say / for hit is great dommage that ye suffer so much
sorrow and pain. and sith it is thus your will. and that ye will none other
wise do. Nevertheless the moure prays you to do to him so much grace. that
sith ye will not take him in marriage that ye will bear this ring for the love
of hi^ Now this ring was the same ring that vye^ne gaf to paris when he
deperted fro her in the hows of the chapelayn / and vye^ne because they should
no more come agei^ took the ring. and when she had received the ring: paris
said to the friar / I pray you that ye tarry a little without. For I will see
what cou^tenau^ces she will make of the ring / and the friar said gladli
Nevertheless he meruaylled much. and incontinent ye friar went out: and
vye^ne began to behold the ring. and when paris saw that vye^ne byhelde the
ring so stro^gely. he began to speak in his plain tongue and said / O much
noble lady why be ye so much meruaylled of yt ring Then^e said vye^ne. Certrs
to my semyng I saw never a fayrer. Then^e said paris. therefore I pray you
that ye take therein pleisir for. the more that ye byholde it: the more ye shall
praise it

Wha^ vye^ne herd these moure thus speak. the^ she was more admerueylled tha^
tofore / and was as a person al abashed and said Alas am i enchau^ted. and
what is this that I see and here speak: and in saye^g these word she would have
fled for fere out of the prison. because the herd the moure so speak: Then^e
said paris / o much noble ladi vye^ne. marvel ye no thing ne have ye no
doubt: lo here is paris your tr^^we seruau^te / and vye^ne was then^ abashed
more tha^ tofore. certes said she. this may not be but by work enchau^ced /
and paris said / noble lady hit is non^ enhau^ted work: for i am your servant
paris. which left you wit ysabeau in such a church / and there ye gaf to me
ye dyamo^d which now i have del^^erd to you. and there ye promised to me ye
would never take husbond but me / and be ye no thing admeruaylled of ye berde
ne of ye vesture that i bear: for they take away ye knowleche of me. and many
other words said paris to vyenne / by which she knew clearly that he was
paris and for the souerayn love that she bare to hi^ / and for the great joy
that she had she began to weep in his arms / and te^brace and kysshe him much
swetely / and there they comforted each other with sweet words / and she abode
long time Vye^ne could not enough kiss him and embrace hi^: and also paris
demanded of her adventure / and she told him all And of all this ysabeau had
nothing herd of / For she was fast a sleep because she had watched all the
night before. and for the great joy and swetenes that paris / and vye^ne
demeaned between the^. she awoke / and when she saw vye^ne being e^braced wit
the moure / she said. Madame wat is yt ye do. have ye lost your wit / that
so embrace this moure: has he enchau^ted you / that ye suffer him so famylier
with you. and is this the faith that ye keep to paris / for who^ ye have
suffered so much pain and sorrow / and vye^ne said. Sweet sustere say ye no
such words but come and take your perte of the solace that i have / for also
well have ye fou^de^ good adventure as i have see ye not here my sweet paris /
who^ so much we / have desired Then^e isabeau approached ner to hi^ and byhelde
him well. and saw that it was paris / and she went and kyssed him. and demened
so much great joy between them three. that there is no person in ye world
that might say ne think it. but so abode great whils i^ this soulas and joy /
till at last paris spack Sweet vyenne it byhoueth that we goo he^s to fore my
lord the doulphyn your fad for now fro he^s forth it is necessary that he
know all our fayte. Nevertheless i pray you to say nothing till I desire you.
and all three came out of the prison: and fo^de the friar which meruaylled
gretely and all they to gydre went to the dolphyn. which had souerayn
playsir wha^ he saw them And nevertheless he was much abashed how his
doughtere was so come. and then^e paris said to the friar / Say ye to the
doulphyn that I have converted his daughter to his will and to mine and that it
playse him yt she be my wife* and the friar said so Then^ the doulphyn said to
his doughtere. will ye take this man for your husbo^d which has delyuerd me
out of prison in great paryl of his person Then^ demanded vie^ne of paris if
he would that she should speak. and paris said ye And then^e vye^ne said to the
dolphi^ My fader I am ready to do your commau^deme^t and his: and pray you to
perdonne me and give to me your benedic ryon. and when she said thus her fader
pardo^ned her and gaf to his her blessyng and kyssed her Then^ said vye^ne Too
here is my good friend paris. whom I have so much desired: and for whom i
have suffered so much pain and sorrow And fader this is he yt so swetely song
and floyted and that wa^ne the ioustes in this cite. and bare wit hi^ the
shield of crystal and my garlo^de / and also this is he yt wa^ne the ioustes in
ye cite of paris: and wa^ their ye iij. banerrs wit the iij. jewellys. and went
away wit the^ without knowing of any man: and also he has delyuerd you out
of prison putting his life in jeopardye for you. And wha^ ye doulphi^ understood
all this he was meruayllously glad and joyous After all this paris went to his
fader: and wha^ he saw him and knew yt he was his sone paris whom he had so
much desired to see: he embraced hi^ and kyssed hi^: and for the yoye yt he
had he could not speak a word / and after all the other lords and knights
ra^ne / for te^brace and kiss him: And after this joy Paris fader said to the
dolphi^ My lord playse it you yt i may borowe my sone home to my house for to
see his mother and his fellow Edward / Then^ said the dolphyn it plaiseth me
right well only for this day For to morn^ i will yt the marriage of hi^ and of my
daughter be made and solempnysed here / and then^e messyre jaques went wit his
sone unto his house: verayli his fader his mother and his fellow edward wist not
where they were for joy and play sir yt the had. and that was no wonder / for
they had no moo children but hi^ and he should wedde ye daughter of their lord
and also paris was in that time become a vaylau^te knight and full of beaulte:
and for many reason it was no meruaylle though they had in him great joye and
playsir / and Edward demanded of him of his adventure and many other things /
and he recounted and told him all

How paris espoused and wedded vyenne / and of the feste yt was there made
THen^e on the morn the doulphin gaf his daughter i^ marriage to paris and the
feste was much noble and suptuous. For much people were come^ thither for to see
the feste / and it endured xv. days. and the playsir and solace which was done
for the love of paris and of vye^ne was so great / that uneath it may be
byleued Which paris and vye^ne lived to gyder a great while in right great
co^solacyo^ and plaisir / but after thacco^plisshement of the marriage the fader
and mother of paris lived not long after in this world / and paris had by
vyenne his wife three children: that is to wete two sons and one daughter And
the doulphyn ordained for the^ much noble matrymonye: And paris after the death
of his fader and his mother would that edward his dear fellow should be herytyer
of all the goods that his fader left. and gaf to him ysabeau to his wife /
which lived to gyder long time in great love and concord. And sone after the
doulphyn and his wife deyeden And then was paris doulphyn and had the
possesyon of all the seygnourye. The which lived wit vye^ne in this world xl.
year / and led a good and holy life in so much that after thende^dement of
sum men they be saints in heaven: and they deyed both in one year. and
semblably Edward and ysabeau deyed both tweyne in one year Therefore late us
pray unto our lord / that we may do such works i^ this world. that in such
wise we may accompanye them in the perdurable glory of heaven / Amen
