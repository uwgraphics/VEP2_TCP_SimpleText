A supplicatyon made by Robert Barnes doctoure in divinity / unto the most
excellent and redoubted prince king henrye the eight.

The articles for which this forsayde doctoure Barnes was condemned of our
spiritualtye / are confirmed by the scripture / doctoures and their own law.

After that he disputes certain comen places which also he confermeth with
the scripture / holy doctoures and their own law.

The comen places which he disputes are these
1 The first is / that Alonlye faith iustefyeth before god. 2 The second /
what the church is and who be the rof / and where by men may know her 3 The
third / what the kayes of the church be and to whom they were given. 4 The
fourth is / that the frewill of man after the faulle of Adam / of his natural
strength can do nothing but sin. 5 The fifte is / that it is lawful for all
manner of men to read holy scripture 6 The sixte is / that men's
constitucions which be not grounded in scripture bind not the conscience of
man under the pain of deedlye sin. 7 The seventh is / that al manner of
christened me^ / both spiritual and temporal are bound when they will be
howseled to receyve the sacrament in both kinds under the pain of deedlye
sin. 8 The eight proves that it is agenst scripture to honor images and to
pray to saints.
Grace and peace from God ye father of our savior Jesus Christ be with your
most noble and excellent grace for ever. Amen
IN most humble wise complayneth un to your grace your continual Orator
Robart Barnes / of the intolerable injuries / wrongs and oppressions where
with the bisshoppes of your royalme vex and have vexed / contrary un to the
word of god and their own laws and doctors / not only me but also all true
preachers and professors of the same / as they did in condemnynge me for an
heretyke: which thing they were not able to prove by the scripture of god /
nor yet shall not / yff it would please your grace indifferently (according to
the office where in god has set you) to here the small as well as the great
and to sustain your pore orator against their violence and strength.

God I take to record that I am right sorye to make this complaynte unto your
grace agenst them / if I could conjecture any other mean to cause them to
redress their intolerable oppressions / where with they daily oppress your
pore and true subiectis / so sore and so violently that with out doubt (if
your grace se not shortly a remedy) god must nedys punish. For I do not
believe that ever he will suffer long so great tyranny agenst his word and so
abominable living as they live / and that in the name of Christ and his holy
church / verily we do not read in any memoryes that our fathers have left
us / that ever the people were under so great tyrauny as now your pore
subiectis be un to them. It is so far come that what so ever he be / hye or
low / poor or rich / wise or folish that speakyth agenste their hypocrysy
(which they call holiness) Ambicio^ / pride dignite (which they call honor
of the church) or vycious living (which ca^ not be cloked) he is either made a
traitor un to your grace or an heretyke agenst holy church / as though they
were kings or God. This may your most exce^ grace perfytly know if you
call to remem^^au^ce those men that they have had to do with ^s it not a
marvelous court that they have? these was never man accused before them of
heresy were he learned or not learned but they found him giltye. is not that a
marvelous court that never has innocents? what court within your realm
may say this again? and if any man speak of gods law and right conscience
agenst this damnable tyranny / little will they stycke to make him as heretyke.
And if yt will not help (to color and maintain their oppressyon (than add
they ^asone agenst your grace though he be never so true a subject and all
vnlykly to make any resystaunce or to think any evyll un to your grace:
notwythstandinge they will not be a shamed to lay un to his charge that he
would make an insurreccion in your land.

Now if yt please your grace let us consider to what end this vncheritable
and unrighteous accusacion of the bysshoppes is inuentyd.

First if there be any man yt preach / dyspute / or put forth in writtinge any
thing not tow chynge them / though yt be never so blasphemous agenst god and
his word / they will not ones be moved therewith: the examples thereof are so
plain that yt needs no proof. your grace may se what blasphemous rubrykes
they allow agenst the blood off christ / what shamfull and abominable pardons
they tolerate and admytte / what disputatyons they do maynteyne to prove the
pope a god and no man as their conclusyons and questyons be plain in their
own laws That the pope is another a god nor a man. And that the pope is no man
/ And whether the pope cane syn or not? and that no man may condemn the pope
though he bring innumerable souls to hell by his occassyon. Again let any
man but ones speak agenst their cloked ypocrysye / or never so little a thing
that longs too them which should hyndre their abhomynacyons: and there can no
scripture / no place / no mastershyp nor excuse in the world save / but they
must either to open shame or cruel deeth. So that yt is plain that their
cruelnes serves to no another end / but as they should say if that any man
will take in hond too preach the veryte / and the true goospell off their
Master Christ purely whereby those thyngys that we take on us / that is our
honor our dygnyte / our worldly promosyon / our dylycyous living / our
gorgyous aparele / our sumptuous palases / breuely all thing that we use to
our pastyme and pleasure shall be manifest too every man / that we do yt
contrary to the word off god. So that they shall know opynly by manifest
scryptures our f^yned hypocrysy / and that we ought not to be lords of the
parliament / nor to have no place of worldly honor among the people nor to
have dominion over them / nor that any thing should be orderyd after our will
but only after ye word of god / nor that we should medyll in any causes but
alonly in reding and preachinge of the word of god / with great study
diligence and labor / ye and thereof be content to have but a pore living /
ye and so pore that we shall be constrained often tymis both to hunger / to
thrust and to suffer great cold / as Christ and his appostles were. Now
rather than this should come to pass we had lever gather our strength to
gether and oppress by violence as many as will hold with this lerning be he
king / duke / lord / Barone / Knight / Man / woman / or child. So that they
/ if it plese your grace / go about to make the insurrexion to the
mayntaynyng of their worldly pomp and pride / and not the true preacher: for
he intendith to maintain nothing but the word of god and that with suffering
persecucion (as ye nature of the word is) and not with persecuting / and is
also neither able nor likly nor wylling if he might to make any resurrexion
against your grace / for he makes no striuinge (if he be the true preacher of
god) nor fighting for this world / but sufferith the childern of the world to
enjoy these worldly things / and intends alonly to bring in to light the
most glorious and heavenly word of god / but that will not the bisshops (the
childern of the world) suffer / which had rather seek and prove all the craft
suttilty and falshode that they can invent / than these thingis should by the
word of God come to light / so that they will make ye insurrexion / and not
ye preacher. Notwythstondyng they are not a shamed / thus falsely to lay it to
the preachers charge / and all by cause they would make your grace to
mayntaine there maylyciousnes. So that under the pretense of treason / they
might execute ye tyra^nye of their hartis on lie. For who is that that would be
a traytoure / or mayntaine a traytoure / agenste your most excelent and noble
grace? I thynk no man / ye^ and I know suerly that no man can do yt / with
out the great dyspleasure of the eternalle god. For. S. Paul commands
straytely unto all christen / to be obedient in all things un to their
princes / saying on this manner / Romans 13
Let every man submytte him self to the auctorite off ye hye power. For who
so ever resystyth the power / resystyth the ordinance off god / and they that
resyste shall receyve to them selves da^nacyon. Also. S. Peter confermyth this
/ 1. Pet. 2.
saying: Submytte your selves un to all manner ordinance off man for the
lords sake / whether yt be un to the king / as unto the cheffe head / either un
to dukes as un to the^ that are sent off him for the punishment of evell doars
/ but to the praise of them that do well. Here (most noble prince) no man is
except from the subieccyon of your most excellent power / neither the bisshops
/ nor yet no another man. Not with stondyng yff they were so true in deed as
they pretend in word / This gospelle should they preach them self
faythefully / puerly / and syncerelye to the people / as Paulle commands
Titus / and in him all bishops in these words. Vvarne them (says he) that
they submytte them selves to princes and to powers / and to obey the officers
This are they commanded not allonly to observe them selves / but also to
teach the people to obey their princes, which thing yff they did faythefully
in deed / as they dyssemble in word / than they would not make so holy marters
of them / that have dyed agenst the liberte of princes / in defendyng of their
glory / as they have done. We have many yt be made saints for rebellinge
agenst princes / and for defendyng of their feigned spiritual lyberte though yt
were in saving a theuysh preaste from the gallous / which had deserved death /
ye and for defending of their temporal possessions / and that preastes should
be fre / and all their goods / not bound to pay trybute. For these artycles
have they made many holy saints / but wha^ made they one for defendinge of
gods word and ye kyngys prerogative / which is allowed by gods word? Never
one in all their lives nor never will. where fore your grace may se and
perceive / that they be but dyssemblers and hypocrytis / and nether true in
word nor deed. For if they were / your grace should have more auctoryte than
you have in your realm / and they should have less in the world and more in
the word / but they neither teach it the^ selves / nor suffer (with their
will) other men to teach it. For if any man take in hand to teach ye people
/ yt there is no temporal power with in ye realm but in your ho^de allo^ly /
anon they are ready to accuse hi^ of heresy / by cause he speaks against ye
libertyes of holy church / and they will lay to his charge ye laws (as they
call the^) of ye church / which be none other / but dreamis of their own
inue^cio^ / made age^ste gods law and his holy ordinances / and contrary to
ye prerogat^ue of all noble princes. This will I prove by / law yt they have
/ 15. Q. 6. Alius ite^
whose words be these. zacharias did deposse ye king of france / not allo^ly
for his iniquite / but also by cause he was unprofitable for so great a power:
and set in his stead Pipinu^ ye Emperors father / and did asoille all france
of their oath and alegiau^ce / yt they had made unto ye old king / ye which
thing / ye holy church of rome does often timis / by her auctorite How think
your grace by this law? is this their obedience yt they will show / and also
learn other me^ to be true subjects to their prince / and they be first
rebellious traitors / and yet will they accuse al other men of treason. I would
know of^ them all / who has deposed any king sithe Christ's passion sauinge
they only? who will be kings fellows / ye and co^trollars / saving they
only? A cast of Antichrist
is not this a subtyle craft of Antychrist / to warn other men off heretykes
and of traitors / and in ye mean ceasone while me^ sto^de lokynge for
traitors / comes he in and playth the part of an open traytoure / saving
only that he colors his name / and calls him self / a true subject /
and is ready to accuse other men of treason / that he might escape him self /
but he is suer / that he will never accuse none of them / that speak agenst
the auctoryte of princes / and give to him full auctorite / But if any man /
do begin but to open his mouth / for to declare that he has no te^porall
power / tha^ rages he / and cries out treason treason: But let us return to
their law / and se how they ca^ prove it by gods word / and how it sto^deth
with their true subieccio^ / Is this reasonable / yt ye pope / and they (being
by gods law but subiectis) shall deposse a king? What example have they of
our master Christ / or of any of his apostles? what scripture have they to
help them? we ought not to depose a king though he be wyked.
How dare they be so bold / as to depose a king / which is ordenyd of god /
ye and by his holy word / having none example / nor scripture for the^? Be
they above god and his blessed word? But they will say / that the king was a
wyked man / I answer / the chronicles / give contrary wytnes / how that he was
a very good man / and right simple: and by cause he was so simple / therefore
Pipinus which had all the rule under him / thought him silfe better worthy to
rule than the king / and so wrote un to the pope and desired him to give
sentence / whether he was better worthy to be king that had all the pains and
labors / or he that had no labor Now the pope / to make Pipinum his friend /
gave sentence with him / and deposed the other and made him a monk. This can I
well prove by good chronicles Now let your noble grace consider / yff yt were
right / not only to depose such a king but also to make him a monk? This have
they done with other noble kings / and no doubt / but that same or worse /
will they attempt to do un to your grace / yff you dysplease them / and at
the least they will do their utter most. Let all the hole rabble off the^ /
tell your grace / when a true preacher off christ's gospel did such a
dead; There is no officer that has need to be a frayde off Chrystis gospel
/ nor yet of ye preachers there off / For they will give them auctoryte
te^poralle / But off these preuy traitors / can no man be to ware. you may se
by experience / how in a manner by their preuy treason they have gotten in to
their hands / half your royalme. But let us grant the^ / that the king
was a wicked man. The scripture commands us / to obey to wicked princes /
and geuyth us none auctorite to depose the^ / who was more wicked than Herod /
and yet. S. Johan suffered deethe under him. who was wyckedder than Pylate? And
yet Christ did not put him down but was crucified under him. Breuely which
off all ye princes were good in the appostles days? and yet they deposed none.
So that gods word / and the practyse off our Master Christ / and his holy
apostles are openly agenste them. More over their own gloss says that he
was not deposed / by cause he was vnsuffycient / but by cause he was wanton and
lecherous with women. O my lords yff you be not afraid of the vengeance of
god / at the least take a little shame of the world un to you / that have so
long time with so great tyranny defendyd these laws that be so opynlye
against gods ordinance / agenst gods word / and agenst the commen ordinance
and consent of all the world. And this thing have you done / to the great
injury off noble princes / to the intolerable subduynge off all noble blood /
to the oppressyon off their true subjects / to the dystruccyon off all commen
welthes. And fynalle to the damnacion off many a Chrystened soul. Tell me by
your faith / do you believe that there is a living god / that is mighty to
punysh his enymyes? if you believe yt / say un to me can you deuyse for to
avoyde his vengeance / which be so opynly co^trayrye to his word? what
answer think you to make to him? Think you that he will suffer your word
to be hard / and let his godly word be despised? Think you that yt will be
suffycient for you to say / that they be the laws of holy church? Think you
yt he will be thus taught off you? Than were yt time to pluck him down / and
set you up. Nay my lords he is no child / nor you shall find yt no
chyldis game / thus to tryfle and play with his holy word and his blessed
ordinance / ye and that to the dyspysyng / of the maker both of heuyn and
earth. Say what you will / ye are not able neither by craft / nor subtyltye
(and yet be you falce enough) to defend this matter / neither a fore god / nor
yet before our noble prince / nor a fore any man off lernyng that will be true
to his prince: for which way so ever you turn you / our Master Christ / and
all his blessed apostles be agenst you / and will openly accuse you / that you
be contrary to their word / and to their deed. Answer ye to them / answer
not to me. yff I hold my peace / they will speak. Nor yt will help you but
little / to cry after your old manner heresy / heresy / a Traitor / a
traitor: for now you cry against your selves / and off those things they do
accuse you. Do you think yt with the ordinance of god / that you shall
depose a king by cause he lyuyth in advoutrye / or is a lecherous man? If you
think yt a lawful cause / why do you not preach yt opynly? why do you not
lay yt to kingis charges? why suffer you them to be kingis that live in
aduouttry? why do you not put your laws in execution? you say they be the
laws of holy church / and there by may you depose princes. But yff you will
put them in execucion / than were yt much better / to be a bishop or a
preaste / than to be a king / or a duke.

For you may live in whordom / or in any other ungracious living / ye and that
to the destruccyon off many men's souls / and yet no man so hardye to repreue
you / as your own law does openly command in these words. Di. 40. Si
papa.
If the pope do draw with him innumerable people on a hepe to the devil of
hell / there to be ponyshed for ever / yet shall no mortalle man presume / to
repreue his sins / for he must iugde all men / and may be judged off no man
etc^. Likewise have you an other law in your decretales / yt no lay man may
repreue a preate. etc^. How think you by these lawys / De. here. Cu^
exiniuncto. et sicut in.
yff they be not off the deuylle / tell me what is off the devil? you will
both repreue / ye and also depose princes / but you will neither be deposed /
ner yet repreued off any mortal man. what think you your selves gods? But
how can you depose a king / and yt lies not in your power to make a king /
For either he is borne a king / or he comes to yt by eleccio^ / or he wynnethe
yt victoriously by sword. which way so ever he comes by yt / you can not make
him. And will you depose him for fornicacion / how would you handyll king
David / David. Solomon. Nathan.
and king Solomon / would you depose them by cause of advoutrye / So do you
more than the prophet Nathan durst do.

But let us come to Herod / Herod
that kept his brothers wyffe / would you depose him therefore? Than do you
more than. S. Johan durst do. For he durst no more do but repreue his vice /
and dare you depose him. But let us go forth with your law / what auctoryte
had the pope and you / to set Pipinu^ in ye room And not rather to let the
kyngedom chose them a king. Our Master Christ said / his kingdom was not off
this world. But you will be above kings in this world / and not allonly
depose them / but also set in new at your pleasure. More over by what
auctoryte did ye pope dispense with the royalme off their oath? your law
says / that the holy church of Room / is wont so to do. I pray you off
whom has she lernyd this same wont? who has geuyn her this auctoryte? Can
she dyscharge us of our obedience that we owe to our princes? is not this off
the law of god? Stondeth yt not also with ye law of nature? ye do not
turks and infydels faythefully obey to their princes? Is not the princes power
off god? and will you depose this power? or ca^ you dyspe^ce with this law?
Actu^ 5
S. Peter lerneth you yt you are more bound to obey god and his law / tha^ to
man / but you little regard. s. peter's saying. wherefore what say you to yo our
alone law? whose words be these? Therebe certain men which say / 25. q. 1.
Sunt quidam
that the pope may all ways make new laws. The which thing we do not
allonly deny / but we do steadfastly afferme / that where our lord / and his
appostles openly / or else holy fathers following them have defyned any thing /
that there the pope may make no new law. But rather is bound / to confyrme ye
thing that is a fore preached with his blood. etc^. What say you to this
law my lords / that takes a way from you all manner off power off those
thyngis that be openly in holy scripture / and commands you also to dye for
the defense of yt. Now / is not the princes power openly in holy scripture?
Are not we commanded by gods word / to obey all manner off princes? Are not we
bound to keep our oath by the word of god / that we have made to our
prince? This may be proved by your own law / 23. q. 5. Regum officium
saying. We must keep un to princes and powers faith and reuerens. etc^. My
lords herey^d not / fide^ / and oportet / And how come you with your
dispensacion for our oath and say non oportet / that we are not bound to be
obedient to our princes / yff you dispense with us. How can you dyspence with
us of our oath / seeing yt is agenste gods law? But paraduenture you will
answer as your gloss does / Glossa. c. supra.
that ye may be defendyd that the pope may dyspence in those things that be
age^ste the appostle / but not in those things that pertayne to the artycles
the faith. etc^. By this law / the pope may dyspence / that every man shall
have two wives. He may also give us license to live in aduoutrye / and to rob
/ and to kylle* he may also dyspence with us / yt we shall owe none obedyence
to our prince / nor keep no faythefulnes toward him / but rebelle and be
traitors agenste him (That is the intent of your gloss in this place) for
there is none of these / that be artycles off the faith. Here may men se /
what teachers you have been / and also be toward god and his holy appostles /
and toward your noble princes. The truth is you were never wont longer to
hold with the^ tha^ they did maintain your carnalle desyers and do those
things that you commanded them to do. This could I well prove both by
ancient cronicles / and also by the practes off your own law / yff it were
not to long a process. But this dare I well say / and that under the pain
off loosyng my lyffe / that yff yt shall chance our most noble prince (and
off your party shall he want none occasions) our to displease you / or else
to restrain your carnal appytytes / which you call the lybertyes off the
church / or to dymynyshe your wordly riches / which you call the goods of
the church / Than shall his grace well know / ye and also feale yt / that
there is no faythefulnes in you But that you will be contrary in all your
deeds / to your feigned words that you now speak. I pray god that I may be a
liar. But I know your lordeshyps so well / that you will not of your honor
suffer me to be a liar. And yff his grace believe not me / let his grace read
all his chronicles / and not allonly them / but all other noble princes
cronicles. And his grace shall never find that they were true chylderne off
obedyence / yff their prince did dyspleasse them. I think this be experyence
enough. Almyghtye god forbid / that ever they should learn you by any more
experyence. But let us return to your law / how are they able to defend yt
by fore your grace? Are not they traitors / that will make any power with in
your royalme / not allonly so good as youres / but above youres? Is yt not
against your prerogative? Is yt not agenst the commen assent off the royalme?
who ca^ deny this co^me^ proverb / but they only. On god / and on king. But
what signifies your royal Croune / what the croune signifies.
that your royalme gives you? Which is underneath worthily and suffycientlye
fulfilled with your graces bed / And so fulfilled / yt underneath can no manhed
come in / so long as your graces is there: that is / no man may by right
usurp any auctoryte that belongs to your grace with out treason.
Furthermore / your crown is close above / sygnifiyng / that in earth is there
no another superior power yt belongs to England. Now where will my lords the
bisshops come in to this Crown? yff they come under / they must thruste out
your graces head / for ye Crown is to little for both your hedes. yff they
come above / so break they the clossenes off your Crown / and lie also in
your graces neck / sygnifiyng / that they will oppress your grace. Let
them answer to this / as well as they can. I would not gladly defend so evell
a cause as theyrs is. What will they say to. S. Paul / that was a bishops
as well as they / and never the less obedyent unto temporalle princes / ye and
that unto infidels. And not alonlye he / but all his ordinance. All his
wrytynges / and all his bisshops did agree to the same. And yff they will
dispice. S. Paul / by cause he was but a beggar / and no lord off the
parliament what will they say to our Master Christ our mighty / gracious /
and excellent prince / was not he obedyent un to Pylate that was an infydelle /
and in auctorite much less than your grace / did not he obey in body and
goods / did not he pay tribute un to Caesar / was not he crucified / under
Pons Pylat / was not he a spiritual man / was not his cause ryghtuous / was
not he mighty to defend his cause was not he worthy to be exempted / was he
not anointed (I mean not with oil but with the holy ghost) so well as they /
and yet would keep the order / that was set by his heuynly father. Did not he
sore rebuke Peter / that would have defended his cause / and sought for such
carnal lyberte / agenste the power off princes / Did he not clearly take a
way / the temporal swerd from him? we never read that ever he drew yt after
/ and yet we read that he had causys suffycient. And now commyth Peter's
successoure / and he will draw yt out / and head pryncis there with. who gave
master vicare auctoryte / to do that ye the parson durst never do / ner
could never do yt / was his cause never so right (ye though yt were to defend
christ) with out great rebuke of his master. Thus your grace may se / how
they do usurp / both the name of christ / and off his holy appostles / but
they neither agree in word nor deed. what does yt profit / to call an open
whore an honest woman / the name can not make here honest / Disti. 40. No^ est
facile. di. 40. multi sacerdot^.
so lykewysse (as their law says) They be not the chyldern off holy men /
that sytte in ye romes of holy men / but they that do their works. etc^. Also
in a another place. The seat does not make a preaste / but ye preast makes ye
seat. The place does not sanctify the man / but the man sanctifyeth the
place / All preastie be not holy / but all holy men be preastes. etc^. Now
yff your grace would follow their own law / what were they less than
bishops? Take a way their seat / that is their worldely pomp and pride /
their outward shynynge / and their glorious name / and what remains in them
/ Surely not one point that belongethe to a bisshope / This may your grace
well do / there is neither law nor conscience can let you ye both the law
of god / and also conscience does bind you to do yt / how can your grace
otherwise be discharged / except you set other men in their romes / that will
do those things / that belongs by holy scripture to bishops to do? There
out commith their name / why should they not also be hounde to live there
after? your grace has taken some off them from the bochers staulle and made
them bishops / you have taken some out of the carte and set them in Peter's
Chair / who can deny but this your grace may do? (All ways providyd that
they do those things that belongs to their office by the word of god / or
else your grace is in danger.) But who can prove / that they are worthy off
this dignite / that your grace has heaven them? much less to be your
controllars / ye and also to be above all your laws / and to have auctorite
to deposse you. But if your grace would do the^ right / you should return
them home again / the bocker to his staulle / The beggar to his wallet / the
carter to his whyppe / and than ask them yff they be of the church? and what
exempcion they have from your obedyence? and from your law / and what
auctorite to deposse kings? But as for this / your grace can order yt much
better / than I cane deuyse. I say yt for no another purposse / but for to
declare your graces power / and your goodness toward them / and likewise
their unworthiness / and ingratitude / agenst your most noble grace.

I will return again to our Master Christ / when the multitude would have
chosene him king did he not fly? Io*
So that he did not allonly learn obedience in his doctrine / but also he did
practice yt in his outward works and lyuinge.

Fynallye / they shall never be able to prove to your grace / but that Christ
and all his apostles were subject / to the temporal princes / both in body
and goods / and took no another rule in this world / but only to preach ye
eternalle word of god / and left all wordly rule / unto temporal princes /
whether they were faythefull / or unfaithful. But now commyth our spiritual
fathers (So must we call them allonly of customme and of no deseruynge) and
will command princes to be sworn un to them / and to defend them / and
their lybertes / with all their gorgyousnes / and proud dignytyes of this
world. which oath / yff the princes will not make to the^ / they will
interdyte their land / and private them of their dignite / ye and also asoyle
men off the oath / that they made to their prince. This is opyn in their law /
de hereticis. De hereticis. Ad abolendum.
Ad abolendum. How does this agree with. S. Paulys commandment / and with
our Master Christ's factes? Is this obeying to princes / to depelle them their
royalme / yff they will not be sworn unto them / Be these true subjects. Is
this the office of bishops / Be these the successors of Peter / and Paul. Be
these the perfyt men that have forsaken all thing and followed Christ. Doubtless
they forsake all things / that they can not get. Be not these perfytt /
forsakers. But they will say that princes be bound to be sworn / to defend
their church / from heretykes or else to be deposed. This is yt that I lokyd
for. Whom call you heretykes. Who shall judge these men to be heretics.
After what law shall they be judged. yff you call them heretics / that speak
agenst your laws / and agenst your libertyes / and agenst your dignite /
than are Christ and all his holy appostles heretics. For they defend
(pertinaciter as you say) their lerninge age^ste your laws / and that not in
one place / but in every place / as yt is open in holy scripture. But now yff
you take them for heretykis that be agenst Christ and his holy word / than is
ye kings grace sworn to expelle you his realm and to defend the church from
you. For more contrary than you be / can no man be. But the very truth is /
that you do intend to make the kyngis grace but your hangeman (this is a
shamfull name for a prince) but the shame be un to you yt are not ashamyd / to
give him ye very office off this name / ye and (by cause you will do nothing
but shamfullye) also to mock him / with a glorious title. For you make him but
a mynister of your myschevous tyranny so that so oftyn as you have condemned
any man / agenst right and agenst gods law / for an heretyke: so oftyn must he
come and receyve this man off your hand (for you say with the Jews / that
you may kylle no man) and so put him to death / and not once deny yt / nor
yet ask you what he has done to deserve death / for you are ready to answer
him / and say (as the Jews did. If he were not an evell doar we would not
commytt him to your hondes. More gets he not of you / for you be spretualle
men and may kylle no man / but he is bound to do yt by your law / under the
pain of losyng his royalme. So that he is bound / to crucifye christ so oftyn
as you cry Crucifige / Crucifige. Let every Christen prince consider in his
conscience / whether that the Jews did not proceed even on this manner agenst
Christ or no / ye that was more indyfferent than this is / for there Pylate
was judge / and here be they Iudgis / and princes be but servants. But I pray
you my lords / where have you gotten this auctorite over princes / to co^pelle
them to swear to you in any cause / what and if the king would be an infidel
/ would you expel him? what can you do more by right than lay the word of god
to him / and the danger of his infydelite? you have no auctorite to deposse
him / for Christenyd men must obey to vnfaythefulle princes / did not Christ
this? did not Peter this? did not Paul this? does not the word of god
command you this to do? saying.

1. Petri. 2
Fere God / honor your king / be subject not allonly un to them that be good
and easy / but un to them that be evell. What say you to these words? how
can you avoyde them? how can you avoid the vengeance of god? But now if yt
pleasse your grace / they will lay to my charge / that I speak agenst the
preuileges of holy church / I will infringe the lybertyes of holy church: I
answer. I know no lybertyes nor preuyleges that holy church has / but these
that Christ has left here / Is this liberty in his word to do agenst
christ's holy word and ordinance / and to follow men's dremes? Is Christ's
holy word / of so little effect? why did not Christ than give this lyberte in
his word to holy church? Did he leave that to you to do? Show your
commission.

Call you this a preuilege / to be agenst your natural prince of the royalme
/ and to make him subject un to you which have no title of pre-eminence / but
alonly of tyranny? Than has holy church gottyn a goodlye lyberte. But what
mean you when you say / holy church? if you mean your selves only / than
the kings grace is much bound un to you / that you do exclude his grace and
al his commens out of holy church / in to the which Christ has bought them
with his most precious blood. And if you understand by holy church the wholle
congregation / than are all Chrystenyd men and all there gods exemptyd from
the kings grace and underneath you / So that by this meanys you will make his
grace a king with out a royalme / and he shall have the name / and you shall
have the auctoryte and the foolke. But is this Christ's church? Is this holy
church that is so contrary to the lord of all holiness? who has made her so
holy? why did she not claim this liberte / in christ's and his holy apostles
days? But now my lordis our most noble and gracious prince commands you
to answer / and to defend your own laws / to defend your libertyes / and
to lay for you by what title you do usurp his graces power / seeing that you
be but his subiectis. He will know by what auctorite you do keep any Courts /
or do execute any commandments with in his royalme? what auctoryte you have
to prove testamentes / and to take of every pound a sertyn? and to give letters
of mynystracion / over those gods / that you never labored for? What title
have you there to? The man was not your subject / and how come you by ye
mynistracion of his goods.

Also what auctorite have you to defend your temporal goods with both
swerdes? as yt is written in your law. 15 q. 6 Au^toritate^.
15. q. 6. Auctoritatem. This is more than the kings grace can do / for he
has but one sword / and will you have both? But what auctoryte have you to
punysh them that stryke preastes? And them that be bacbyters / and sclanderers?
Furthermore by what auctorite de you command / that preastes shall not appear
before temporal judges? 23. q. 8 Co^venior 33 q. 2. Inter hec
As yt is written in your law. 23. q. 8. Conuenior. in the gloss. Also in a
another place 33. q. 2. Inter hec. Also by what auctorite / have you made that
princes shall make no statute as concerning the goods of the church. 23 q. 8
Conuenior in ye gloss. 23 q. 8 Co^venior.
But yff any thing shall be geuyn un to you / than the Emperor and kings
have sufficient power / but yff you shall pay any thing to the mayntaynynge
of the kings grace and his commen welthe / than no man has auctoryte with
out your consent. Have you not wytched the world this long time? But
forthermore / the kyngis grace would know / by what auctorite you have made
that a preast shall not be sued before a temporal judge for whoredom? These be
the words of your law. Di. 28. c. Co^sulen^m
But un to you that be lay men / is lef^e no power for to judge off preastes /
nor yet to search any thing of their living. etc^.

My lords may no man judge / of your living but your selves a lone? not the
kings grace / who has geuyn you this exempcyon. who has geuyn you power to
be judges over bawdrie. Is bawdrye a spiritual cause / Does bawdrye belong
to spyrituall men? S. paul calls yt the work of the flesh? Gala. 5.
and will you call yt a spiritual cause? It may well be spyrytuall of your
spryte / but I am suer it is agenste the sprete of god. But by this meanys have
you asoyled a great doubt whereat ye kings grace and all his noble lords
have often mused That is / how yt came that there was so great wherdome and
bawdrye / among them that b^ called spiritual men? But now yt is no wonder /
for bawdry is a spiritual cause and belongs only to the judgment of
bishops. But shortly to our purpose / The kyngis hyghnes commands you
straytely / to show him by what auctoryte that you take causes out of his hye
Court of complaynte / and to bring them a fore you / As who should say you
would redress both the Kings law / and also ye sentence there of. And not
alonly that / but you will Master the Kings grace and his law. Shortly to
recyte all the iniuryes and wrongys that you do to ye Kyngys hyghnes / to all
his noble blood and unto all his true subiectis / yt were to long a
process. wherefore breuely I require you by the faith yt you owe to christ
Jesus / and by ye oath yt you have made to ye Kings highness (if you be not
dispe^sed with all) yt you a^swere to these things: you can not deny but
these things you do / wherefore what will you say thereto / what a^swere ca^
you make / have you vpholde^ these things so long / have you shamed /
troubled and killed so many of ye Kings true subiectis for yt thing / which ye
ca^ not defend to be true? and if you have nothing for you / but your own
dreamis / they will not help you. For they be accusyd with you. And therefore /
ye kings highness (if it pleased him) might lay hie tresone to your charge /
and also the abomynable crime of heresye / which is all ways in your mouths
/ if a man speak but against your old shows. what say you to these thingis:
yff they be false / it is a small matter for you to refelle them by holy
scripture / if they be true / why give you not place? you shall well know
that I will defend ernestly Gods cause and my princes / and that not out off
mine own head / but out off holy scripture / which I do neither wrynge nor
wreste / but only declare it by the practyce off our most gracyous Master
Christ Jesus / and of all his holy apostles. Can you require any more. It not
this suffycyent probacion? Is not this cause good? Is yt not ryghtuous? Is yt
not to the honor of god? Notwithstondynge I am sure that I have taken this
matter in hond with you / to my great danger / if you may have your wyllys /
But here do I set my lyffe / and body agenste youres / to defend this matter
agenst you / if yt will please the kings noble grace / to give me fre pardon
and to defend me from your vyolence / I ask no pardon of any trespass /
that you or any dedly enymye that I have / can prove that I have done agenste
ye kings noble grace / but that alonly I am compelled to fly your dedly and
intollerabylle vyolence. But if yt shall pleasse the kings highness to defend
me from your vyolence in my right / I will dyscusse this matter with you by
Christ's word / And if I be ^uercome / I do not refuse death / and so shall
you be shortly rydde off me / And if you be overcome / yt were right that you
should be punysshed. Not wythstondyng I will desyer but amendme^t. wherefore
Most gracious prince / Humbly and mekely / I beseech your highness and that in
the name of our savior Jesus Christ / a fore whom you must give an accumpte
off your dignyte / Also I requier you by your oath / that you have sworn to
right and to Justice / ye and also by all your honor do I humbly beseech
your grace that you will defend me in my right / as you will be defended of
Christ Jesus from all your dedly enymies ye not to defend me / but gods word
/ and your prerogative / So that I trust your grace will not be dyspleased /
with your daily bedeman / that he requires you so ernestly / for he desires
of you nothing but that that stondeth with gods honor / with your graces
pre-eminence / and with good right and conscience / and also with ye oath that
your grace has made both to god and man. This would your grace do /
though I did not require yt / The cause is not mine / but it is Christ's veryte
which will neither be mocked nor yet overcome / It is also your prerogatyue /
which deserves defending and also audyence / Though there were no word of
god. I do require (as god shall Judge me) no wordlye promosyon thereby / but
alonly the verite of Christ's word / and of christ's ordinance. Which
thing if I can prove / I doubt not but your graces conscience / will Judge
it right yt I should be hard / your grace has no need of the bishops no
more than off me / but un to Christ's word / your grace is bound / under the
pain of everlasting damnacyon / from the which neither the bishops / neither
all their power / neither their pardons / neither heaven nor earth can deliver
you if you be found a transgressor. This is the veryte / let them crake and
face / blaste and blow / Pray / Singe ^ Curse / absolve / bring in their
custo^s / bring in their church / bring in their laws with all their myters
and their crossestaues / with all their spiritual honor / they can not help
your grace but that the danger shall remain to your graces parsone / if any
thing be amiss: but this your grace knowith better than I can tell yt
wherefore I will return again to the cause. It is openly proved that our
master Christ / and all his holy apostles were subject / both in body and
goods to te^porall princes / And took no temporal rule nor iurisdiccyon on
the^ wherefore I conclude / that what so ever they be yt will be exempt from
the te^porall power / Be neither Christ's apostles / nor christ's dyssyples /
no nor yet true chrystened men / though they have Christ's and Peter and
Paul's name / an hundred times. For Christ's words be plain which says /
Matt. 20.
you do know that ye lordys of the gentles have dominacyo^ over the^ but so
shall yt not be among you. And these words were spoken to the apostles and
can not be avoided by alytle dystynccyon / as the bishops are wont too avoyde
all holly scripture. But what so ever they say / the practyce off our Master
Christ and off all his holy apostles will declare how they understand yt. And
moreover to stope their mouths I will show them how holy doctors understood
yt / Origene To. 13.
Orygene upon this text / Omnis anima / says on this manner / All manner off
sins yt god would have punisshed / he would have them punyshed not by the
bishops and rulers of the church / but by the Iudgys off ye world etc. be
not these words plain? S. Paul says / Omnis anima / and origyn says /
oi^a crimina / So that S. Paul takethe away all men from their subieccion /
And orygen takes away all crimes from their correccion. what gloss can they
make of these words a fore your grace /? if they lay for them the old
custom and their lawys I will lay a genst the^ our master Christ S. Paul /
S. peter and Origin. And I will deny their customs / their church and also
their lawys. And this will I not do only / but I will prove yt by their own
law that I may do yt rightfully / These be their words. Disti. 8. c. qui
He yt does dispisse the verite and presume to follow ye custom / either is
envyous and malicious agenst his brethren to whom the veryte is opened / or
else he is vnthankefulle toward god by whose inspyracion his church is
instruct / for the lord says not I am ye custom / but I am the veryte etc.
these words be plain age^ste all customs and al churches that be agenste the
word of god. Distin. 8. c co^suetudo
This same thing have they also in another place in these wordis / that same
custom / that is crept in un to certain me^ / may not let but that the
veryte must preuaylle and overcome. For a custom with outh the verite is but an
old error etc^. These words be plain that all customs be but errors that
be agenste the veryte. And as for to deny their church I may lawfully do yt
/ for that is not the church that is with out and contrary to the word of
god for christis church hears his word only / as christ says my sheep
hear my voice / Ioa. 10.
and they follow not a stranger but fly from him / for they know not his
voice. Also in a another place / he that is of god hereth the words of god /
and therefore do not you here / Joan. 8.
by cause you be not of god. Here is yt opyn that they that be not of god hear
not the word of god nor be of his church / but of the church of the deuylle
which he does hate. Now have I prouyd un to your grace / that I may
ryghtously deny there church / their lawys and their customs. Not with
stondynge all this / yet will I prove by their own law that they have none
auctorite te^porall / but al their auctorite is allonlye in the ministracion of
gods word which they do sore despyce / these be the words of their law The
church that knows no corporal wepons / 16. q. 3. Porro*
does patiently abyd allonly god which is her defe^der / when it shall plese
him for to have mercy etc^. Here is plain that the church knows no temporal
wepons. Also in a another place. The holy church of god has no sword but ye
spiritual sword / with the which she does not kylle / 33. q. 2. Inter her.
but quikkyn. These words be plain / that the church has no sword but ye
spiritual sword. Now how comme the bisshops by the temporal swerd? Like wise
in a another place. I may morn / I may weep / I may waylle agenst wepons /
agenst sodyars / and agenst the Gothos. 23. q. 8. Co^venior
For my teris be my wepons / for such thyngis be the wepons of preastes /
otherwysse I ought not nor I may not resyst etc^. Here you this my lords? how
that S. Ambrosse had none other wepons / but wepyngis and prayers / and that he
might not in any wysse defend him self with other wepons.

How think you / was not he of the church? was not he preuileged of god as
well as ye? and yet could he not nor ought not defend him nor medylle with the
temporal sword Moreover yt is open in yovre own law.24. q. 4. Quesitum.
That the temporal sword / and the mynystracyon of the word are of God / 24.
q. 4. Quesitu^.
and these too be diverse and the one may not usurp others auctorite / the
words of your law be these. The mediator between god and man Christ Jesus /
has deuydyd the offices of both powers in to their proper acts and in to
dystincte dygnityes / Di. 10. ^. Quoniam.
wyllinge by his own medycinalle meknes that men's hearts should be lyfted up
/ and not with man's pride again to be drowned in these inferior things / so
that christen Emperors (As consernyng eternalle life) should have need of
bishops / and lykwysse the bishops (for the course allonly of these temporal
goods / should use the Emperors lawys / so that the spiritual accion should
be distyncted from the worldly courses / and he that should serve god should
not wrappe him self in worldly busynesses etc^. Here is plain that your
grace must have fulle power over al worldly coursis / and the bishops allonly
mynistracion of the word of God: and as your grace may not usurp to preach
the word of god / no more may they usurp any power yt belongs to your
sword. This same se^te^ce have they. di 96. c. dis. 96. c. cu^ ad veru^
Cu^ ad veru^. So yt your grace may openly se by godis law / by their own
law / by the practice of our master christ and of his apostils and by ye
exposicio^ of holy doctors yt ye bishops neither have nor yet may have any
power temporal / but all is allonly in your graces hand / and you are bound
to use yt and to execute yt / in your own parson to the uttermost strength yt
God has geuyn you. And in no wysse may your grace give this power or part
thereof un to other men / for so doing do you break the ordinance of gods
word and declare your self a fore god that you are un worthy and not
sufficient to minyster the honor yt god of heuyn has freely geuyn un to you.
This may not your grace do / for that were as much a fore god as though you
would controlle his ordinance / or else that you would not mekelye a plye your
self with dylige^ce to mynister that thing that god has enjoined your grace
un to. Not with stondynge / this may your grace do allonly if the busynes be
so great that belongs to your administracion that your grace can not alone
discharge the^ / than may your grace chose and assyne certain other so many
as shall be necessary / which shall dyscharge all manner of causes. All ways
provided / that these men shall be but mynysters and servants underneath your
grace / and no kyngis: nor they may not usurp any power as kyngis by no law
perpetual / but al yt they have is by your graces eleccion and assynement.
More over these me^ may not be of all manner of sortys / but they must be such
men as god has ordenyd there unto / and that have no another particular
adminystracion. As Dukys Erlys / Barons and such temporal lords which be
ordenyd of god for that same purposse to help your grace in all such
te^porall causes. And it were unright that your grace should set a Duke to
preach gods word / and a bishop to be a Judge in westmynster halle. For the
office of a bishop is only to preach gods word and there in to be a
faythefull minister which thing if he do / he is a true bishop a fore god /
for the faithful administracion makes him a bysshope and not the name /
neither can the world make him A bishop that does not preach truly Christ's
word / but as our master christ says / A fore god they be but theuys and
murtherars. Joan. 1^.
And un to them be the words of the prophet writtin / woe be un to you which
do ye work of god dysseitfully / and also S. Paul spekith in the name of all
bishops saying / w^ be un to me yff I preach not the gosspell / 1. Cor. 9.
for necessite is put unto me and an office is committyd un to me So that if
the bisshops do not preach the word of god / they be not necessary / nor
nedefulle un to the body of christ wyche is the church. For what good does
that member of the body that does not his mynistracion. As what profit were
yt to have an yie / that would another se nor yet could se / or to have afote
that would neither goo nor could goo. The body were well easyd yff such
members were cut a way / for they be but a burden and a cumbraunce unto the
body. So like wise be these bishops that glory allonly in the name and in the
dignities of the world / as our bysshopes do / of whom ye church of god is
nothing learned nor helped / but allonly men do learn of the^ / al po^pe and
pride / Disdain / Spytefulnes / fornycacion / Advoutrye / Couituousnes / And
how to oppress our poor brethren And to blaspheme ye blessed name of god.
These be their works and their examples yt the church of god may learn of them
/ as al ye world can testifye. And they that be their best friends and will
lie for them with out shame can not prove a fore your grace but yt these
things be true. Now if it pleasse your grace to remember your conscience /
and think with in your self whether that these bishops be of God or none /
And whether they ought thus to be suffered of your grace or no which if they
were a mo^ge Infidilles cold not be thus sufferid both to rage agenste god and
also agenst man For doutles if there came an infidelle a monge us that were
lernyd in our law / which is ye word of god / and saw our bisshops use so
freely their abhominabille pomp and pride and vycious living / there were no
doubt but that he would meruelle and rekkyn in his conscience yt we lived both
with out law of god and of man For there is no law that can allow their
lyuinge / wherefore your grace is bound in conscience to see a mendment / and
to se them reformyd / and to set them to do their mynistracyon that they be
called un to in the church off god / and not so to steal and by vyolence to
usurp / other men's administracions / and to despise their own duty. And if
your grace do thus reform them / no doubt but you shall have the fauore of
god: and prosper in all things / and have a commen welthe well ordered / and
welthye and true subiectis and faythefulle at your need. For the ordinance
of our eternal father is / that all men hye and low / spiritual or temporal
/ rich or poor / of what state so ever they be shall be obedient un to their
prince not in one thing / but in all things (both in body and godis) that be
not agenst the word of god. So that if ye kings grace would requier any
worldly ordinance over our body or goodis / yt is not against our faith / 1.
Reg. ^
we are bound to obey and to fulfylle yt This power was given to kings of god
and not by man / as it is open in the boekes of the kyngis. So that it shall not
be lawful for no man / with out danger of his soul / for to break yt. For
this have ye apostles lernyd and fulfilled both in word and deed. wherefore
there may be no resystau^ce / nor rebellion in any wise agenst our prince for
orderinge of these temporal goodis / no though he do unright / but all must
belefte to god and we must only suffer / and as for ye wrong god shall punyshe
yt at his pleasure / but it belongs not to us to resyst. Therefore do I now
exhort al true Christen men and women out of ye bottom of my heart and by the
blessed name of christ Jesus which is the judge of quycke and deed / whose
judgment no man ca^ a void neither by might / neither by power neither by
wissedom nor by learning / neither by deeth nor by lyffe / neither by man nor
by angel / neither by saint nor by devil / neither by place hye nor love /
that they do fullefille this ordinance of our eternal father with all the
strength of their hearts / and obey and also defend their king at al tymys
when they be required / agenst al men / ye and if it were possibil for angels
to rebelle agenst their king / that there also they / defend him This do I
believe to be the truth / and this is my conscience a fore god / a fore whom I
must answer at the general day of judgment / where as no falsehod nor
hypocrysye can help. where fore I do protestate a fore God / A fore angelle /
a fore man and a fore heaven and earth / and all them I call to record that I
believe this to be the veryte / and therefore will I abide there by. And this
protestacyon make I / with out any worldly compulsyon / Alonly compellyd by the
heuenlye word of god.

Now most gracyous prince / this is the confession of mine obedience that I owe
unto your grace / which both I and all true chrystened me^ are bound to
keep. And this have I declared with open scrypturs of god and with ye
exposicions of doctors / the more dylygently / that I might stop the mouths
of mine adversaries which would not else be a shamed too instruct your noble
grace / how that I would intend treason / and insurreccyon agenste your grace.
But now your grace may lightly judge whether that they be traitors yt will
mynyshe your power / ye and almost take yt clear a way / and not so
content except they be also your fellows with in your own realm / or else I
that will be obedyent with all mekenes and lowlines unto your grace / and also
learn all other men so to be and to give un to your grace all manner off power
erthlye under god: which thing I do not now allonly learn / but all ways did
learn that same and did intend for to have proceeded further in this cause yff
yt had pleasyd god that I might have continued / as mine artycles for the
which I was condemned do openly declare and testyfye which thing as soon as
the bishops perceived / they thought yt was not good for them that I should
continue and therefore they took me and condemned me for an heretyke / with
out scripture / agenste goods word / Agenst all good order / Agenst all good
conscyens / against all manhod. And not so content / but put me to the greatyst
shame that their hartys could deuyse and afterward put me in preson almost
three yearys / and yet not so content but sought all false / vncherytable and
vnchrystyned meanys too bring me to death / the which no doubt but they had
done yt / yff they had not feryd your grace more than god.

It is not to be doubted / but that your grace and also all the world /
hearing how they did use me / will suspect and Judge / that I have done some
intollerabylle crime / and yt I have offendyd in heresye and too sore agenst
god and his blessed word / or else the bishops would never have so handelyd
me / this all the world will think. For they be reverent fathers and holy men
/ and great prelates off Christ's church / and men off great learning / and
such men that they will not of their honor / handyll any man so sore / except
yt wers for a great and an urgent cause. Truth yt is that all these things
they will be / but how honorable / and how cherytable they have been un to me
/ the cause will declare yt self / yff yt please your grace no more but too
read the artycles for the which they have condemned me. And that your grace
and all the world might se them / I have put them forth in prynte I think
your grace shall not find many things in them neither agenst god nor yet
agenst his holy word / but agenst their abomynable living and damnable pomp
and pride be the most part off them all. Those ware the thyngys / that I took
in hand to dystroye / but these things a fore god / and a fore all christen
men / be very far from heresy. Notwythstondge / yt was not possible that I
and all my friends could deuyse any reasonable end with them / but that I
should spend all my lyffe in prison / my trespace (as they said) was so great.

To speak against princes is at the most but treason / but to speak agenst
these holy goods is both treason and also heresye / which is ye greatyst
crime in earth / and if heart could deuyse any greater crime yt should be laid
un to him / such heavenly parsons be these / It is evil medlynge for mortal
men with immortal gods / for there is no way to make satisfaccio^. This have
I well proved to my utter undoing / for I being in preason made diverse tymys
meanys un to certain off them / as un to my lord of london / first that yt
would pleasse his holiness / to speak with me / and if he found me in any
errors / that he would be so good as to teach me / for I desired to learn the
veryte and yff he found me in none / I would desire his holiness that he would
labor for me too my lord Cardynalles majesty that I might come out off
preason / for I was a young man / and if I had made any fault for want of
descrecyon / learning / or wysdom / I would gladlye in time to come by gods
grace make a mendes / Allonlye my request was that he would be so good as to
help / that I might not lose and spend all my lyffe and youth in preason / but
at the lest that I might teach chylderne to write and to read / and learn
them their gramer / and so too get my living with truth and honestye / and
not ydlye to live in preason. He made me answer that too speak with me he had
none occasyon / and I was the man that he never saw and therefore he knew no
cause why I should desire too speak with him / and as for teaching off
chyldern he would neither grant me with in preson / nor with out. Moreover if
it pleasse your grace / at a another time I sent certain off my friends un to
him again / to the number of.viij. or.x. of the which a certain were
aldermen and of the worshypfullest co^meners with in your City of London /
and men of so good substance that no court with in your royalme would have
refusyd them for twentye thousand pound / these men I desired in the way off
cheryte and for Christ Jesus sake to go to my Lord of london / and to desire
him too be good lord un to me (for my cause was put to him) that I might come
out of preson / and that he would take some cherytable end with me / and what
so ever thing that he would require off me lawfulle and reasonable I would
perform yt and thereto find him good suertyes. This thing did your faithful
subjects dylygently for me / Alonly off their cherite and goodness: but what
answer they had / your grace may know off the bysshope off london and off
them / Never the less I dare well say (under your graces favor) that the
great Turk could not be moore cruel than the Bishop off london was / though
his cruelnes were colered a little with holy hypocrysie For he would neither
grant them any part off their petycyon / nor yt gladlye hear them too speak
for me / but so handelyd them that they were both a frayde too speak with me
and also to speak for me to any man / ye they were a frayde to give me meat
and drink. This is truth that I say to your grace They be men I trust a
live and of great honesty for to testify it / So that your grace may se /
what cheritable fathers they be / what holy bishops they be / what men of the
church they be / that will nothing but vengeance and dystruccion of their
power brethern / and yff a man come in their danger there is no remedy nor no
ways to come out / nor no man may labor for him. So that yff a man pleasse
them / than promysse they him heuyn and earth with all ye fruits in them / ye
and also god him self. Contrary wise if a man displeasse them and speak
agenste their abominable living / a thousand hellys are to little for him /
and neither fre^d in heuyn nor earth can help him / no Christ's blood can not
profit him / but he must be dampened with out recover. I will pass over the
labor that I made to doctor Steven / And to D. Allyn. For nothing could
help me / so that I am compelled by intolerable vyolence and opressyon to
complain unto your most noble grace / humbly and meklye beseching your grace
/ for Christ Jesus sake / and in the honor of god our father in heuyn / that
you would call ye matter a fore your grace. And if the bishops can yet prove
any heresye in mine artycles / I will refuse no manner of pain that your grace
shall judge me worthy. Notwithstondyng (with your graces favor) I have been
sufficiently punished for one trespass. How be it / I call god to my record /
that in my conscience I neither intended heresy / nor yet learned heresy in my
sermon / and I doubt not / but their conscience will also testifye the same.
Moreover if yt plese your grace / they know that I could bring them good
testimonye and that to a great number out of the university / where I did
preach and was continually.xx. yearis / that there was never man that hard by
me any thing less or more that was worthy after good cherite to be suspected
for heresy. And yet my lords have thus cruelly condemned me for one sermon /
which they are never able to prove heresy by gods word nor by holy doctors.
Notwithstondinge yff it were heresy / me thinks christ's word and his blessed
cheryte would move such holy fathers as they will be / not to cast a way a
man for ever for once errynge / Seeing I offered my self to be taught of them /
and they are not abylle to make a man. Moreover most gracious prince / your
daily orator had good testimony / of his sermon from the best of the
vniuersyte / un to certain men in wryttynge. As un to. D. Steven a letter /
from Master Johan puergould / which hard my sermon / whose testimony. D.
Steven can well report / unto your grace. Also the vicechauncelar did write a
letter unto a merchant of london when ye cause had been a fore him.vj. wekys
testifiynge / that there could none heresy be proved agenste me / and that he
durst say / that I did intend none heresy. Furthermore if it please your grace
/ the bisshops know how ye principal clerks of the university were with me /
if they durst have spoken for them. But all my submissio^ / all my wytnes / all
my suertyes / all these lernyd men / and all the lerninge that I could speak
could not help / but I must needs be an heretic / for I had spoken so much
(as they said) agenste the holy church. Wherefore here be the articles
followynge that were laid agenst me / and also the lerninge / that the bishops
laid agenst me / so nere as god has given me remembrance. This do I not to
get any worldly vauntage or worldly promocion (as god is my judge) for of all
the world I ca^ make no more but meat and drink / the which I doubt not but
god shall send me / for my daily prayer is / lord give me my daily bred. which
I steadfastly believe that he shall do for his wordys sake / where so ever I shall
become. Never the less where so ever I be I shall be a faythefull and a true
bedeman of your graces (better service can I not do your grace.) But this do
I that your grace may know / what tyra^nye the bisshopes use underneath your
name / for the which your grace shall straytly answer a fore god. where fore
humbly I beseech your grace that in time to come you may so over se them that
they do not opresse poor men by tyranny / as they have done long / and do
also daily / and not alonly that / but they also learn and compelle men to
learn / clearly and openly agenst Christ's holly gospelle and the exposycion of
doctors. ye and agenst their own law / to the ever lasting damnacion off
many a christen soul / of the which things I have partly opened unto your
grace in certain artycles that here follow / which I have proved by the
invyncibylle word of god / and that not wrong after my sense / but after the
exposycyon off their own doctors / wherefore I doubt not but yt your noble
grace will defend this book from the tyranny of the bisshops tylle they be able
to condemn yt with Christ's holy word / and doubt ye not but that the heuynly
father and his merciful sone Christ Jesus / and the holy co^fortar / shall all
ways defend your most excelencie and preserve you in his verite and keep you
in all prosperity and honor of this world / and after this miserable lyffe
shall they bring you un to an heavenly lyffe that never shall have end. Amen.
Now most noble and excelent prince / humblye / and with all mekenes of heart I
desire pardon of your grace for that thing that is either a mysse written / or
not with due order nor with due reverence as yt ought to be to so noble a
prince / for there is no faught in my heart / nor will / But allonly for want
off lernyng / and experience in writing unto so noble a prince / thus Jesus
Christ keep your hyghnes ever. Amen.

HEre follow the articles which the bisshopes did condemn for heresye the
year of our lord a thousand fyve hundred and fyve and twentye the ninthe
day of februarye / which articles were gathered out of a sermon yt doctoure
barnes made in saint Edwardes church in cambridge the.24. day of december /
and were presentyd to the bishops by a master off art called Master Terelle /
a man of no learning as al ye bishops do knowright well / and yet was he
sufficient to accuse me of herisye for these articles which as god knowyth
has neither Judgment in faith / nor yet in heresy / but as far as I can
conjecture and suspect the getherars of these artycles were doctor Rydley and
doctor Preston / chaplens to the bisshope off London / notwythstondynge none
of them both / nor yet no another man durst ever take upon them for to prove
them heresy in so much that doctor Rydley did say that it was never his
mind that they should be presentyd as heresy / but (as he said) they were
very evylle and vncherytablye spoken agenste the bishops seeing there was none
of them present. This is the some and the fulle cause of my condemnacion / for
this was allwaies laid to me a fore the vice chauncelar before whom they
ha^delyd this matter secretly in the commen scolys (the dorys looked) and in the
vicehaunchelars chamber for they knew well that al men of learning were agenst
them) and to this I answered no another thing but that the bishops did never
use to come to sermones where fore yff we should never repreue their abominable
lyuinge but when they were present / than should yt be to long. More over /
though they were absent yet were there present of their counselle and of their
court the which would tell them that yt I had spoken / for I had spoken yt
for that purposse but there was no man a monge them all that could ever say of
his conscience but yt these things that I had spoken agenst the bisshops were
true / ye and a great deal more / And yet must I poor man be condemned for
an heretyke. They may (by cause they be lord lie bishops) live in all
abominable and mischevous lyuinge with out shame and with out repreue / and I
must be condemned for an heretyke by cause I speak yt. They may do it / but I
may not speak it / but god shall shortly either make an end of the^ or else of
all the world for such abominable lyuinge as they lyve / the father of heuyn
for the love of his blessed sone Christ Jesus be mercyful un to us Amen

The first article
If thou believe that thou art more bound to serve god to morrow which is
Christemasseday or of Ester day or off whytsonsunday for any holiness that is in
one day more than in a another / than art thou no faythefulle christen man / but
supersticions / and S. Paul is agenste the saying you do observe days years
/ Galat. 4.
months and tides / for un to a faithful christenman every day ought to be
christemasseday Esterday and whitso^su^day. The which thing the fathers
considering that thou dydest not observe ye and that thou woldst never
observe if yt were left to thy judgment for thou art given so much to
wordlye busynesses / for that cause they have assigned the certain days to
come to ye church / to pray to gether / to here the word of god to gether /
and to receyve the blessed sacrament to gether / what fault find you in this
article? by cause I say that one day is not holyar than a another? I pray you
what is ye cause / or what nature is in one day that is not in a another where
by that that should be holyar than the other? By cause (you will say) that we
hallowe the remembrance of christ's birth and of christ's resurreccion in one
day and not in a another. This thing I say must you do everye day for christ
is every day borne / everye day risen / everye day asse^ded up And this must
you believe steadfastly / yt he was borne for you / and rysse to kylle your
death / and ascendyd for your iustificacion / this must you sanctifye in your
hertes everye day / and not one day.

Now varye we but in this thing you say that we are bound to sanctifye but one
Christemasday in the year / and that is supersticiousnes and heresy say I /
not that I condemn your one day / but that you set yt to one day alonly
that we are bound to do every day. Breuely my lord of Rochester a lowed this
article saying he would not co^de^ne it for heresy for an C. li. (this was a
great some of money) but yt was folyshly said (quod he) to preach this a fore
the bodchars off cambryge / as who say they were all bochers that were at the
sermon. But the bishop of bathe asked me whether we might labor on the holy
days or not seeing yt is written thou shalt observe thy holy day.

I answered / that christen men were not bound to abstain from bodily labor
by that commandment / for it was so geuyn to the Iuys / and yff we were
bound to abstain from boddyly labor by that commandment / tha^ was the
kings grace and all his counsel / my lord cardinal and all his counsel in
the way off damnacion / for they causse men to carrye their stuff on the holy
day what day so ever yt be when they will remeue / at this reason all mi lords
were a stonnyed / and wyste not what to say: they were loath to condemn my
lord Cardinals grace / seeing he was so holy a prelate of christ's church /
and ye fact they could not deny wherefore at the last my lord of Rochester
rememberd him self (he is an old man and his blood is cold a boute his
heart) and answered of this manner. A goodly reason. I will make you a like
reason / the bishop of wynchester sufferth the stuys ergo the stuys be lawful
/ at this reason was I a basshyd and sore afraid and durst not answer to yt /
for I perceyved yt it was as lawful for our nobyll prince to carry stuff on
ye holy day (which is not against the word of god) As it is for an harlote of
ye stuys to live in open whordom which is against the word of god / And yet my
lords the bisshops of their great cheryte and of their innumerble sprituall
treasur sufferth both. Brevelye yt were to long to recyte all the madness
that they did use with me (I will not say cruellnes) and yet ernestly they
condemned me / but I will recyte the sayng of doctors which I laid for me /
but they were not regarded. S. Hierom says. Ad Ga. 4.
Therefore be certain days assygned that we should come to gether / not that yt
day in the which we come to get her is holiar than a another / but all days be
like and equalle and Christ is not alonly crucifide in parasceven and risen
only on the sunday / but ye day of resurreccyo^ is all ways / and all ways may
we eat of our lords flesh. Ep^. ^19
etc^. Here. s. Hierom says the self word that I spoke and of these words
was I moved to speak as god does know. Also. S. Austayne / we must observe
the sabbath day / not yt we should rekkyn our self not to labor / but that
all thing that we do work well / must have an intencion to the everlasting
rest / wherefore we must observe the holly day not by corporal idyllenes / and
un to the letter / but spiritually must we rest from vices and concupiscensys
where fore a monge all the ten commandments that of the sabbath day alonly
is commaundid to be figuratlye observed and not by corporal idyllnes. Aduersus
Iudeos
etc^. Also Tertulia^. The carnal circumcision is put a way and extyncted at
his time / Solykwyse the obseruacion off the sabbath day is declared to be for
a time / for we must keep the sabbath day not allonly the seventh day / but at
all times as Esai says etc^. But here my lord of Rochester said / first that
I understood not Tertulian Secondarilye / that he was an heretic / but I pass
over mine answer for this is but a lordly word and he could on another wise
save his honor / but yet stondeth my scripture fast / and. S. Hiero^ and. S.
Augustyn / and also their own law whose words be these / De consecra. di. 3.
c peruenit
It is come un to me yt certain men which be of an evil sprytte have sowed
sertyn evil things a monge you and contrary to the holy faith / so that they
do forbid that men should work on the sabbath day / the which men what other
thing shall we call them but the prechers of Antychryst / the which antychryst
shall make the sabbath day and the sunday to be kept from all manner of work.
This law clearly declares you to be Antychrystes / this is more tha^ I said
I have great meruell that the bishop of bathe being so mighty a lord in
co^demnynge of heretykis was not lernyd in this law seeing yt is his own
facultye.

The second Article
NOw dare no man preach ye true and ye very gospel of god and in especial
they yt be feeble and fear / but I trust / ye and I pray to god that yt may
shortly come / that false and manifest errors may be plainly showed / There be
sertyn men like co^dicionyd to dogs / yff they here any man that is not their
contryma^ or that they love not nor know not / that say any thing agenst them
/ than cry they an heretyk / an heretyk / ad Ignem ad ignem / These be the
dogs that fere true preachers. What heresy find you in this Article.

The third Article.
We make now a days many marters / I trust we shall have many mo shortly for
ye veryte could never be prechid plainly / but persecution did follow. Here did
my lord of bathe inquire of me / if I rekkenyd the^ for marters yt were burnt
at brusellis / I answered yt I knew not their cause wherefore they deyd but I
rekenyd as many men to be marters as were persecutyd and deyd for the word of
god / but he said he would make me frye for this.

The.iiij. Article.
THese lawys / These lawyers / these Iusticiarys / that say that a man may
lawfully ask his own good a fore a Judge / and contend in judgment for they
have dystroyed all pacie^s / devotion / and faith in christen people.

The.v. Article
THis pleatinge in Judgment is manyfestly agenst the gospel. ^. Cor. 6
Luc. 12. Homo quis me co^stituit iudicem / And contrary to. S. paul / I am
o^o delictu^ est. etc^. The some of these two articles is / that a christen man
may not contend in Judgment with his brother for his private welthe / how
think you is this heresy? what say you to. S. paul / which says Now is there
utterly sin a monge you by cause you go to law one with a another why rather
suffer you not wrong / why rather suffer you not your selves to be? obbid? May
not I speak these wordis / be they not of holy scripture? was not I a preacher
and a doctor? was not this Auctoryte suffycyent? Matt. 5.
Also our Master says if any man will sue the at the law and take thy cote
from the / let him have thy cloak also / would not our master that we should
rather suffer wrong / than to go to law for our private welthe? May not I
say these words / wherefore were they wryttyn by the holy ghost? but that they
should be learned? But let us goo to your doctors / Athanasius ad cor. 6.
Athanasius on. S. paulis text / There is utterly sin a mong you / yt is to
say yt is to your co^demnacion and to your ignominy that you do excercyse
iudycialles a monge you / wherefore do you not rather suffer wrong? S. Hiero^.
ad cor. 6
Also. S. Hierom / yt is sin unto you yt you do agenste the commandment of
christ / that you have Judgments a monge you yt which ought all ways to keep
peasse / ye though it were with the loss of your temporal goods / where
fore do you not rather suffer wrong? where as you ought by the commandment of
the gospel / and by the exampyll of the lord pacyently to suffer / there do
you the contrary / not allonly not suffer / but you do wrong un to them that
do no wrong. etc^. Mark how. S. Hierom callethe yt a precept and a
co^mau^dme^t and no counsel. Also Haymo says / Haymo. ad cor. 6
yt is offense and sin in you yt you have Iudicialles: for accusacion
ingenderth stryffe / Stryffe ingenderth discord / Dyscorde ingenderythe
hattryd. And lest peradventure they would say this is no syne to require mine
own / there fore says ye apostyll / truly it is sin unto you / for you do
agenst the commandment of the lord the which says / Luc. 6.
he yt takes a way thy good ask yt not again / wherefore do you not rather
suffer wrong? wherefore do you not rather suffer loss? yt you might fulfill ye
co^ma^deme^t of the lord. etc^. Mark how he callyth yt the commandment of god
and it is sin to ask our own with contencion / 14. Q. d his ita
And your own law says They are forbydyn to contend in Judgment / yt
must be thus understand that they may not sto^de a fore a Judge for them
self but for other men. etc^ Now what have I said in mine article yt holy
scripture / holy docturs and also your own law do not say / but un to this
said my lord off Saint Ass that these scrypturs were but counselles and no
precepts / and alleggyd lira for him of this text / si vis perfectus esse /
to who^ I did lay ye auctoryte of. S. paul yt callyth it sin which it could
not be if it were but a counsel. Also ye auctorite of. S. Hierom / which
callyth it openly a precept but to this he answered shaking of his head
pytuously and said / A good. M. doctor if you were lernyd in duns you would
say other wise / but ye self bishop could say to a certain doctor (which
had great meruell why thy ha^delyd me so) yt I had opyn vro^g but he could not
do thereto but after this came a doctor of law (who^ I know not) and said yt
their law had conde^nyd this opynion and declared those scripturs to be but
cou^sells / but I denied yt and said I knew no such law. and suddenly Doctor
steuyn showed me their law / whose words be these / Illud euangelij / 14. Q.
1. his ita.
si quis abstulerit. etc^. no^ est precipientis sed exhortantis. But I dare say
that Doctor steue^ knew that this was but a small euasyon and of none
auctorite / and therefore he would show me no more of the law for it follows
/ what so ever he be that does not obey the commandment is gytly and worthy of
pain for yt is sin not to obey to the commandment off god. 14. Q. 1.
quisquis
etc^. These be Saint Austaynes words in their own law / Now let every
ch^stened man judge whether that the contrary words be of sufficient auctoryte
to resel ye holy words of scripture or no / and if they avoyde scripture yet
ca^ they not avoid holy doctors you which by their own law be of greter
auctorite in expou^ding scripture tha^ ye pope is: but tha^ ca^ doctor wolma^ /
and he brought this text / if thy brother do offend yt tha^ tell ye church /
what is yt (said he) tell ye church / to who^ I answered yt this place made not
for suynge at the law aleging S. Augustine for me / for it speaks of the
crymys that should be repreuyd by the congregation / and not of the correccion
of the temporalle sword / For yt follows if he hear not the church / count
him as an hethyn and as a publycane / this is the utter most pain that our
master Christ assigns there / the which is no pain of the temporal law /
but at this answer was he movyd and said if I did abide by yt I should be
burnte / this was a sherpe sentence of so great a man as he is / but and if he
had been half so well lernid in scripture as he is great / he would have
geuyn a more cheritable sentence. But Apelles was a Ioly wisse fellow that said
once to a shomaker / Ne suitor vltra crepida^ It is not an.C. year a goo syns
that same Master doctor was butler in that same house where off I was master
and prior / and now to give such a strayte sentence? this is a soddyn
mutacion. But here is it plain that I have spokyn never a word but that holy
scriptur / holy doctors and their own law say the same / both in sentence
and in words. wherefore I can not se how they can condemn this article / for
herysy / and I dare say for them that they rekkyn it none heresy / but
peradve^tur they understand it not nor they did not condemn me for this
article. But here after follow the heresys.

The.6. Article.
I will never believe nor I can never believe that one man may be by the law
off God a bishop of.ij. or.iii. Cyttys ye of an holle contry / Titum. 1.
for yt is contrary to. S. Paul which says / I have left the be hynde to
set in everye city a bishop. And if you find in one place of scripture that
they be callid Epyscopi / thou shall find in diverse other places that they be
callid contrary wise presbiteri.

I was brought a fore my lord cardynalle in to his galary and there he red al
mine artycles till he came to this and there he stoppyd and said that this
touchyd him and there fore he asked me if I thought it wrong that one bishop
should have so meny Cyttys underneath him / un to whom I answered that I could
no forther goo / than S. Paul's text which set in every Cytty a bishop. Than
asked he me if I thought yt now unright (seeing the ordinance of the church)
that one bishop should have so meny Cyttis: I answered that I knew none
ordinance of the church as concerning this thing but. S. paulys saying only
never the less I did see a contrary custom and practyce in the world / but I
know nor the orygynalle there of / than said he that in the apostles time there
were diverse Citys sum seven mile some six mile long and over them was there
set but one bishop and of their subbarbis: so likewise now a bishop has but
one City to his Cathedral church and the co^try about yt was as subbarbis
un to it. My thought this was farfetchyd / but I durst not deny yt by cause it
was of so great auctoryte / but this dare I say that his holiness can neither
prove it by scriptur not yet by any auctory of doctors nor yet by any practyce
of ye apostles / Athanasius
but let us see what the doctors say to mine article / Athenasyus does
declare this text of the apostill / I have left the by hynde etc^. He would
not committ un to one bishop a whole ylde / but he did enjoin that every
city should have his propre pastor supposing that be this meanys they should
more diligently over see that people and also that the labor should be more
easy to bear etc^. Chrisosto^
Also Chrisostom on that same text / He would not that a wholle contre should
be permyttyd un to one man / but he enjoined un to every man his cure by that
menys he knew that the labor should be more easy and the subiectis should be
with more dyligence governydde if the teachers were not distract with the
gouernyng of meny churchys but had cure and charge of one church only etc^. My
thinks these be plain words and able to move a man to speak as much as I
did / but grant that you may have all these cytis yet can you make it none
heresy / for my lord cardynalle grants that it is but agenst him and agenst
you which be no gods / but I must be an heretyke there is no remedy you will
have yt so / and who is abille to say nay? not all scripture.

The.7. Article.
IT can not be provyd by scripture that a man of the church should have so
great temporal possessyo^s / but they will say if they had not so great
possessions / they could not keep so many seruantis / so many dogs / so meny
horses as.xl. or.l. and mayntane so great pomp and pride and lyve so
diliciously. what heresy find you in this? is it heresy to speak agenst your
horses and your hounds and your abhominabille living? and douteles I did
not say but that you might have possessions but allo^ly I spoke agenste the
superfluousnes and the abuse of them / but I pray you how ca^ you prove it by
scripture / that a man in as much as he is a bishop must have temporal
possessions I am in the negatyue prove you yovre affirmatyue this am I suer of
that chrysostom says / A bishop ought to have nothing but meat and drink
and clothe / I will bring no scripturs for you regard them not. Ad Tymo c. 5.


The.8. Article
SVer Iam that they cannot by the law off god / have no iurisdiccion secular
and yet they chalynge both powrys which if they have why do they not put them
both in use? for they must say as the Iuys said / we may kille noman. This is
the article that did byte you for you can not be content with the office of a
bishop but you will be also kings but how that stondeth with gods law and
with your oath I have declared yt to our nobille prince I doubt not but he
will put you to the trial of these articles.

The.9. Article.
They say they be the successors of christ and of his apostles / but I can se
them follow none but Judas / for they bear the pursse / and if they had not so
great possessions I am suer an.C. would speak agenst them where now dare not
one for loss of their promosyon As for this article I will over come you with
the witness of all the world: you may well condemn yt for heresy / but it is
as true as your pater noster / Judas sold our master but once / and you
selle him as oftyn as he comes in your hands.

The.10. Article.
THere is not the greatyst pharisye in this church / but I am suer I prycke
him with these words and he knowithe that these things be true though he say
the contrary and yt do I well know. This article did I speak by cause of
doctor Rydle which on a time grauntyd in master doctor buttes house that the
bishops were clear out of order And therefore I say that I know yt

The.11. Article.
THese ordynary bishops and prelattes do follow that false prophet balaa^ for
they would curse the people but by the prouisyon of god they are compellyd
toblesse the^ / that is to say / to teach them to live well though they the^
self live most myschevously and so the Assis which they ride a pon that is the
commen people have their lyuys in abhominacyon This is the heresy for it
speaks agenst the holy fathers which be almost as holy as Balams ass which
did ons speak ye word of god to a good purposse and so do they never / but I
grant that I did offend in calling you ordenary bisshops for I should have
callid you inordinate buchers / and as for that that I compare you to balaam it
is your own law.ij. q. vij. Secutisunt / And.c. Nos si. And as for your
living all the world knows it.

Pet. 2.
S. Peter speaks of / these be ye fovntayns with out watter: for they give no

NOw they selle us / they selle the people / they selle holy orders / they
selle church halowyng / there is no better marchandysse in chepesyde / wilt
thou know what is the price of a church halowyng? no less than.xl. shelinges
/ they sell pardons and remyssions of sins as openly as a cow and an ox is
sold for they never grant them with out monny. The suffrigan of ely did ask
of master Johan pur gold.xl. shelinges and the offringe for halowynge of. S.
Edwardes in Cambrige / ye and he would not do it so good chepe / but by cause
he had a goddoughter buried in ye church yard / But this may be prouyd by
exampillys ynow for bring ye forth one church in all England that you have
hallowyd with out monny or with out hope of money / and I will grant my
conclusyon false / and as for your pardons all the world knows your

month once and no man shall curse the. Also they curse them that be not
buried in their parish church / yt must be understand yff yt they be rich men

bathe said there was no such manner to curse men. And all the world knows
the contrary. Moreover I red these articles in the book of the general curse

agenst your damnable and pompous myters / I think such ornaments were to be
condemned even among hethyn men I will not say a monge christen men / but this
dare I say that there was never no god among hethyn men yt ever delytted in

THese myters I can not tell from whence they do come except they take them from
the Iuys bishops / and if they take the^ from the Iuys / than let them also
take their sacryfyces and their oblacions from them and offer calves and lambs
as they did / and than have we nothing to do with them for we be christen men
and no Iuys. I pray you tell me where you find but one prick in holy
scriptur of your miters? our master did institute bishops / and Saint Paul
sets out what is their office and also what is their ornamentis / and yet
speaks never a word of your myters but I dare boldye say that if you be put
to the trial you shall be feign to run to ye old law. But can I be an
heretyke if I condemned clearly your myters and said they were of the devil?
when you prove them to be of christ's institucion than will I be an heretyke.

THese myters with two hornis I can not tell what they should sygnifye except
yt be the hornis of the false prophet of whom it is spoken with these hornis
shalt thou blow a fore the al syria / 3. Reg.
and so did he mock their rings and al their ornamentis and ecclesyasticall
ceremonies. It will come to my saying that you be bishops of the old law for
you have nothing to defend your tynges your ornaments and your ceremonis /
but for to maintain these deposse you kings and princes / Interdyte lands /
and burn man wife and child: and when you have al done / you have defended
but a deuelish toke^ of pride. The doctors / that would favor your proud
tokyns and expound them to the best have declared that the two hornys of your
myters did signifye the new and the old testament that you should be lernyd in
them both / Now I saw that this exposycion did not a gre with that thing /
for no man can be less lernyd in them than you be / wherefore my thought it
was but a vain exposicyon and therefore I comparyd them to the two hornis of
the false prophet / by cause (as you know) this false prophet said un to the
king that he should with these two hornys blow a fore him all syria / and yet
he lied for the king was the first man that was slain / so lykewysse you say
un to ye kings if they follow your counsel and maintain your auctorite and
be rulid after you tha^ shall they over come all their enymys as sin death /
and hell / and yet you lie / for you must needs bring those things to
damacion and to destruction for you have not the word of god for you /
wherefore you must be false prophets. Here have I compared off a symylitude
your myters to the two hornys and you to false prophets / what if this be
false / what if I can not prove it? yet can you make me none heretic / for
than must you make those men heretykes / that have comparyd the forkes of your
myters to the new and the old testamentes and you to the true apostles for
they have made a greater lie than I have done / and they are never abylle to
prove yt / and as for me / I will prove my saying true (if you will stond to
scripture) or else will I be takyn for an heretyke.

THey have baculum pastoralem to take sheep with / but yt is not like a
sheppeherds hoke / for it is intricat and manyfolde crokyd and turnethe all
ways in so that yt may be called a mase / for yt has neither beginning nor
endinge and yt is more like to knock swyne and voluys in the head with than to
take sheep. They have also pyllers / and pollaxes and other ceremonies which no
doubt but they be but tryfles and things of naught. I pray you what is the
cause that you call your staff a shepperdes staff? you help no man with yt /
you conforte no man / you lift up no man with yt / but you have stricken down
kings and kyngdoms with yt / and knokkyd in the head dukes and Erlys with yt /
call you this a shepperdes staff? there is a space in the shepperdes staff
for the foot to come out again / but your staff turns and wyndeth all
ways inward an never outward / signyfying that what so ever he be yt comes
with in your danger how yt he never comes out again / this exposicio^ your
deeds do declare / let them be examynyd that you have had to do with. But these
be the articles for the which I must needs be an heretyke but all the world
may se how shamfully that I have erred agenst your holynessys in sayng the
truth. But my lord cardinal resonyd with me in this article / all the other he
passyd over saving this and the sixte article / here did he ask if I thought
yt good and reasonable that he should lay down his pyllars and pollaxes and
coin them: I made him answer that I thought it well done. Than said he / how
think you were yt better for me (being in the honor and dygnyte that I am
in) to coin my pyllars and pollarys and to give the monye to five or six
beggars tha^ for to maintain the commen wealth by them as I do / Do you not
rekkyn the commen wealth better tha^ five or six beggars? to this I did answer
that I rekkened it more to the honor off god and to the salvation of his soul
and also to the comfort of his pore brethren / that they were coined and geuyn
in alms. And as for the commen wealth did not hang off them for as his grace
knew the commen welthe as a for his grate and must be when his grace is gone /
and the pyllars and polaxes came with him and should also goo away with him /
Not with stondynge if the common welthe were in such a condycyon that yt had
need off them / than might his grace so long use them or any other thing so
long as the common welthe nedyd them / not with stondynge I said / thus much
did I not say in my sermon agenst them / but allonly I damned in my sermon
the Gorgious pomp and pride of all exteryor ornamentys / Than he said well you
say very well / But as well as yt was said I am suer that these words made me
an heretyke / for if these words had not been theryn / mine aduersaris durst
never a showed their faces agenst me / but now they knew well that I could
never be in dyfferently hard / for if I had got the victory than must all the
bishops and my lord cardynall / have laid down all their gorgious ornaments
for the which they had rather burn twentye such heretykes as I am / as all
the world knows / but god is mighty and of me has he showed his power /
for I dare say they never intendyd thing moore in their lyuys than they did to
dystroye me / and yet god of his marcy has sauyd me agenst all violence / un
to his godly wysdom is the cause alonly known. The bishop of london after my
departing said un to a substancyall man that I was not deed (for I dare say
his conscience did not rekkyn me such an heretyke yt I would have kyllyd my
self as ye voice went / but yet would he have done yt gladly of his cherite)
but I was in Amsterda^ / where I was never in my lyffe (as god knowythe nor yet
in the contrye this ten yearys) and certyn men did there speak with me and he
fanyd sertyn words that they should say to me and I to them / and addid there
un to that my lord cardynall would have me again or yt should cost him a
great some of money which I do not clearly remember / I have meruell that my
lord is not a shamyd / thus shamfully and thus lordly to lie / all though he
might do yt by auctoryte / And where my lord cardynall and he would spend so
much money to have me again I have great meruell off yt / what can they make
of me? I am a sympylle pour wretch and worth no man's monny in the world
(saving of theyrs) not the tenth penny yt they will give for me / and to burn
me or to dystroy me can not so greatly profit them / for when I am deed the
son and the moon / the starrys and ye element / water and fire ye and also
stonys shall defend this cause agenst them / sooner than the veryte should
perysh. But if they be so cherytable to good workys / and to spend their monny
so well they have presoners and pour men ynow in ye land let them bestow
their monny of them / and as for me I do promysse them here by this present
wryttyng / and by ye faith that I owe to christ Jesus and by that fidelyte yt I
owe to my prince / that if they will be bound un to our nobyll prince after ye
manner of his law / and after good conscience and right yt they shall do me no
violence nor wrong but dyscusse and dyspute these artycles and all other yt I
have written / after ye holy word off god and by christ's holy scripture with
me / Tha^ will I (as soon as I may know yt) present my self un to our most
noble prince / there offeringe my self to his grace yt I will either prove
these things by gods word agenst you al / or else I will suffer at his graces
pleasure whom the father of heaven ever preserve in honor Ame^ / And if you
refuse this co^dycyon / than say yt you be neither good nor cheritabyl for I
dare say you can desire no more of a christen man.

PReastes do mumble / and rore out their dyryges and masses in the church and
church yardes for their founders / curyous to speak their words dystinctlye
/ but I ensuer the^ yt their prayers shall do them no good / but only
acceptacio diuina. As for this article the bishops did not make much off for
they perseuyd that yt was getheryd with out any sentence / for my saying was
That men should make their prayers in such a faith and with such a devotion
that god might accept them / and not so ydylly and with out al devotion babyll

THere is no prayer acceptable too god / Except yt be fetchyd from the fire off
the altar. This article was also gathered with out any sentence / for my
adversaries did not greatly care what they made of such artycles as pertenyd
too learning and edyfyinge and therefore they never erryd so much as they did
in them / For in those artycles that were agenst the bishops they did great
dylygence and in the most part of them getheryd they mi very true sentence and
mine own words as co^cerninge those things yt made against ye bishops /
though in those things they left out vncheritablye / those words yt made for
my declaracio^ and also for the probacion of my saying / The which I have also
here left ought alonly addyng the articles as they laid them age^ste me that
al men may see the worst that they had against me: for all men may think that
they will neither lay the best nor yet the truth agenst me / but this article
did I thus preach / that men should not in their petycions and prayers put
their good works nor their good deeds and their merytes and for them desyer
God to be merciful un to them / but they should desyer the father of heuyn to
be merciful un to them allonly for christ's merytes / for they were the
things where by both we and our prayers were acceptyd in the syghe of the
father / and to prove this I brought sertyn scripturs as this what so ever ye
shall ask the father in my name / he shall give it you. Joan. 14.
And also the figure of ye old law / where there was no sacryfyce done but
with that fire that was takyn from ye altar. Now did I say that Christ was
our altar / but this mine adversaries understood not / But I have meruell what
this article does a monge the other heretycalle artycles / I think they do
not rekkyn it heresy.

The.25. Article
HE did not pray for the three estates of holy church / neither made he his
prayers in the begynynge of the sermon according to the old custom but at the
last end / and for the true knowledge of all christian men making no prayer to
our lady / nor for the souls in purgatory / nor for grace expedient. If the
bishops had had any indyfferencye in them or any wysdom or learning they would
have been a shamyd that such articles should have be brought a fore them / what
is this to the purposse of heresy that I did not pray for the three estates of
holy church? and yet they gravnt that I prayed for all true christen men and
that men might come to the true knowledge: is not all the church conteynyd in
this? But they be mad men with out all consyderacion / they be so blyndyd in
their worldly honor that God does al ways send them such shame. And that I
did not pray to our lady nor for ye souls in purgatory / what is that to
heresy? for than were the apostles heretykes / for they did not pray in their
sermons to our lady nor yet for the souls in purgatory. And as for praynge
for grace expedyent that is not the preacher bound to do opynly: But my
thinks by these artycles that god gave me a great grace / that I durst so
boldly repreue the abominable living of the bishops not feryng the danger
that should come there of / but this I leave to others men's Judgment / and I
dare say boldy that if I had spokyn tentymys as much against the auctorite of
our noble prince / and agenst al his dukes and lords / and had takyn all
power / both temporal and spiritual from them and geuyn it to our ydyll
belligodes the bysshopes / than had I been a faythefull christen man for I had
defendyd the lybertis of the holy church / ye and if the kings grace would
have put me to death I doubt not but they would have made of me an holy
stinckynge marter as they have done of meny other for such causys but God
send them his grace Amen.

NOw if your grace do not take upon you / to hear ye disputacion and the
probacion of this article out of the very ground of holy scriptur / my lordys
the bishops will condemn yt a fore they read yt as their manner is to do
with all thyngis that pleasse them not / and which they understand not / and
than Cry they herese / heresy / an heretyke / an heretyke / he ought not to be
hard for his matters be condemned by the church / and by holy fathers / and
by all long customs and by all manner of lawys. Un to whom / with your
graces favor I make this answer. I would know of them / if all these thyngis
that they have here rekenyd can overcome christ and his holy word / or set ye
holygost to scole / and if they can not / why should not I be hard / that do
require it in the name of christ / and also bring for me his holy word / And
as for the holy fathers they have understand Godis word as I do / There fore
though they will not here me / yet must they nedys here them / Neuerthe less
(if it pleasse your grace) it were no right to bind us all ways to the
Judgment / of our old fathers for than what need we the gift of wysdom what
need we the gift of understanding? but let us use their wysdom / and their
understanding / what need we to studdy / to make any new thyngys? for the
fathers have made all. Breuely what need we any syngulare gifts of god? For we
can de nothing that is syngular with them / for the fathers have done all / But
what right were yt / thus to bynd us more to our fathers / than our fathers
were bound to theirs? why did they not all believe the first father? ye why did
they not all believe christ the master of al fathers? 1. Tess. v.
Breuely why does. S. Paul commau^de us that we should prove al thyngis / and
a bide by that that is good / what need we to prove that thing / which we are
bound to reseue? our Judgment is not lokyd for in ye thing which we are bound
to reseue / and than what need. S. Paul to say / hold that thing that is
good / for all the fathers be good / and none bad / and whether they be good
or bad we must reseue them after the bishops lernyng / but than how shall we
follow. Sayn. Ioa^s counsel / that bids us to be ware of Antichrist? for he
shall be in all agys / and with out doubt he shall be no dyspysyd parson in the
world / nor no fool / nor vnlernyd / nor with out the color of holiness / nor
with out the name of a father / no nor un to man's Judgment / with out a good
spirit And therefore / that men should not be dysseyuyd with these exterior
dysgysynges / as with holy hyprocrisy / with ye name of lernyng / with the name
of fatherhod ye with the name of christ / he byddythe men prove of whence the
spritys be / whether they deny christ or none: for he that denies that Jesus
christ is come in ye flesh / is a^tichrist / 1. Joan. 4.
Now if these lordis or any off the fathers do deny / that christ is come in
the flesh than are they a^tichristes / But my lordis will say that they do
not deny / nor none off their fathers do deny that christ is come in the flesh
/ for they do grant that christ is borne of a vyrgyn / and is very god and
man / and did here live on earth and preachid and thaught and did many great
miracles / and afterward dyed and assended up to heuyn and there sytteth on the
right hond of the father with many other things more / which they do not
allonly grant but are also ready to dye in the cause: wherefore they will say /
that this is nothing agenst them nor yet agenst their fathers.

My lords I pray god yt be not / but give us the lyberte yt the apostylle
geuythe us here / to prove your spretys / and than shall we know off whence
you are. First all those things be true that you have granted of christ /
but. S. Ioha^ will that we must prove you nerare than thus / for in this is no
probacion of the spretys / for the deuylls grant all or the most part of
these / and if there should come one that would deny with open words any of
these artykyllis / men would give him none audience / nor they would not here
him / wherefore there were no fear off such men / for as soon as they open
their mouthis to speak agenste any of these / a none we condemn them with out
any further judgment wherefore. S. Ioha^ must needs speak of other craftyar
heretics than these / which grant all those things with many other mo (to
ma^s judgment) ye and all they do / they do yt in christ's name and preach
in christ's name / and do many good works in christ's name / ye and
paraduentuer al so do miracles in christ's name / and yet never ye less under
the great craft and subtylty of ye deuylle they deny Christ / Is not this a
marvelous thing? how can this be? How can they deny christ and also grant
christ? how can they preach christ / and yet deny christ? But all this craft
and subtylty use they in christis name / and all by cause they will deny Christ
/ for the more that antichrist preachyth christ / the more will he deny him.
For when he has once got him auctorite by christ's name / than will he
rage / and wax secretly mad agenst Christ / and yet will he preach Christ /
and also deny Christ and so subtylly deny him / that with out we stycke fast
to holy scripturs / and have the spryte of god / we shall not perseue him /
therefore let us now prove his sprete / and we shall sone se that he is not off
god. But first we must declare / and perfytly know what is christ. Not allonly
by the name / for yt Antichrist grants / but we must search out the properte
/ and the nature / and the very effect of christ / and so shall we sone know
him* In holy scripture Christ is nothing else but a savior / a redemer / a
iustifyar / and a perfect peace maker between god and man. Mat. ^. 1. Cor. ^.
Esa. 53.
This testimonye did the angelle give off him in these words / he shall save
his people from their sins / and also. S. Paul Christ is made our
ryghtwysnes our sanctificacion and our redemption / moreover ye prophet
wyttnesyth ye same saying / for ye wrechidnes of my people have I strykyn him /
so yt here have we christ with his properties / now if we will confess that
christ is borne in to this world / tha^ must we grant with our hearts yt
christ is al our justice / all our redempcio^ / all our wysdo^ / all our
holiness / alonly ye purcheser of grace / alonly ye peace maker / by twene god
and man. Breuely al goodness yt we have / yt yt is of him / by him / and for his
sake only. And yt we have no need of nothing but of him only / and we desyer no
another salvation / nor no another satisfaccion / nor any help of any other
creature / other heuynly or erthely but off him only / for as. s. Pe. says /
there is no another name given unto men / where in they must be saved. Actu. 4.
Act. 13.
And also. S. Paul / by him are all that believe iustifyde from all things.
Moreover. S. Johan witnesses the same in these words (he yt is that has
opteyned grace for our sins and in a another place* 1. Joan. 2. 1. Joan. 4
He sent his sone to make agreement for our sins. Now my lords / here have
you Christ and his very nature fulle and holle / and he that denyethe any
thing / or any part of these things / or take any of them and aplye them or
give the glory of them to any other person than to Christ only / the same man
robythe Christ of his honor / and denies christ / and is very antichrist.
wherefore my lords / first what say you un to this article / un to these
propertis of Christ / yff you grant yt / tha^ are we at a point for it says
that faith in Jesus Christ only iustifythe a fore god / secundarilye yff you
deny yt (as I am suer you will for you had lever deny your creed then grant
yt) how can you than a void / but that you be the very antichristis / of whom.
S. Johan spekyth for now have we tried your spretis that they be not of god /
for you deny Christ. That is / you deny the very nature / and the properte of
Christ. you grant the name / but you deny the virtue: you grant that he
dissended from heaven / but you deny the profit thereof / for he descended
from heaven for our health / this deny you and yet it is your creed. you
grant that he was borne / but you deny the purposse: you grant that he is
rysyn from death / but you deny the profit there of / for he rosse to justify
us. you grant that he is a savior but you deny that he is allonly the
savior. I pray you wherefore was he borne? to justify us in part? to redeem
us in part? to do satysfaccion for part of our sins / so that we must
have a another to make satisfaccio^ for the other part? Say what you will if
you give not al / and fully and alonly to one christ / than deny you christ /
and the holy ghost and. S. Johan does declare you to be contrary to christ.
This may also be proved / by a plain scripture of the holy ghost which is this.
No man in heuyn nor in earth / neither under the earth / was abylle to open the
book / or to look on the book / till ye lamb came un to whom the senyours
spoke / on this manner. Thou art worthy to take the book / and to open the
selys there of for thou wast killed and haste redeemed us by thy blood. How say
you to this my lordis? In heaven was there none found / neither by ye angyllis
/ nor yet by the senyours / worthy to open the book but christ only / and will
you find that they could not find? will you set an helper to christ / whom
they set a lone? but I pray you tell us what he shall be. All the world
knowethe that they be good works / but now from whence come your good works?
whether from heaven / or out of the earth / or from under the earth? if they
were in any of these places / where were they when the Angels and ye senyers
sought them? have you found them whom they could not find? but let this pass.
I pray you what will you lay for your good works? or by what tytell will
you bring them in to Join them with the lamb in openyng off ye book? The
senyours have laid for them that the lamb alonly was worthy to open the book
by cause he was slain / and redeemed them with his precious blood. Now what
cause lay you for your good works? The lamb has alonly dyed for us. The
lamb has alonly shed his blood for us. The lamb has alonly redemyd us.
These things has he done alone. Now if these be suffycyent / than has he
alone made satysfaccion / and is allonly worthy to opyn the book. Moreover /
This tytyll is given to the lamb by them yt be in heuyn / and how dare you
(being but stynkynge caryon) give it either in part or in hole to any other?
Also they that be in heuyn confess that this la^be is allonly worthy to redeem
them / be your works better tha^ they? Or can your workis help them? if
they can / than is not the lamb alonly worthy to redeem them / if your workys
do not help rhe^ than are they alonly Iustyfyde be the lamb / and if they be
/ why shall not we also? Moreover the seniours fall down by fore the lamb /
geuinge him allo^ly praise / And shall your good workys stand vpe by the lamb
/ than be they better than the senyours. But let us prove this thing by opyn
scripturs / That no man shall be able too deny yt? Saint Paul took so great
labors to prove this artykyll / as he never took in no another / and all
because he would make yt plain / and stope the mouthys off the again sayers /
But all this will not help the^ / yt have not the sprete of god / Never the
less we will by gods favor / do the best we can too confound the crooked
enymys of Christ's blood / and though we can not make them his friends / at
the lest we will so handylle them / that they shall be a shamyd openly to
speak agenste him / as they have done long time / And so will we handylle
them (by gods help) yt all the world shall know that they glory in Christ's
name and by him be they also hye promotyd in this world that they can not be
hyer and yet deserve they of christ / worst or all me^. But let us go to our
purposse. S. paul says / All men be sinners / and want ye glory of god / but
they are justified freely by his grace / To. 3
through ye redemcyon yt is in christ Jesus. What is this yt all me^ have sinned
and ye are iustyfyde freely? How shall a sinner do good workys? how can he
deserne to be iustifyde? what call you freely? if there be any deseruyng less
or more / than is it not freely. what call you by his grace? if it be any part
of works / than it is not of grace / for as. S. paul says / Than grace were
not grace. To. 11.
here can be none euasio^ / yt wordys be so plain if you bring in any help of
workys / than for so much is not our redemption freely / nor yet is yt of
grace / but partly of workys / and than do you dystroye all. S. paul / and
his holle dysputacyon / for he contendyth agenst workys / and clearly excludyth
workys in Iustyfycacion / and bryngythe in grace only / Now that yt is excludyd
in the wholl by contencion / can not be brought in / in part to the cause.
This is opyn in his wordys / where he says. Where is now thy reioysynge? yt
is excluded / By what law? by the law off workys? Nay: but by the law off
faith / we do Judge and give sentence that a man is Iustifyde by faith with
out the workys off the law / Here you not / that the gloryacyon off workys is
excludyd / and yet will you bost your workys? Here you not plainly Saint
Paul's sentence / that Judges clearly with faith / and agenst all workys in
this cause / how can you a void this? is it not clear. What can you answer
too yt? Is not this Paulis proposion yt he took to prove / faith only
iustifythe? It were but lost labor for Paul to prove that works did help to
iustifycacion / for that the iuys did grant. In so much that they gloryed
against the ge^tyllis / which had no manner of works / and for that dispysed
them as peopell un worthy to be iustifide / but paradve^ture you will make a
blind and a damnable evasion / and say that Paul condemns the works of the
old law / as unworthy to iustificacion / but not the works of the new law
/ are you now satysfyed in your conscience? Think you that you have well
asso^yd. S. Paul's argument? think you that this is sufficient to avoyde. S.
Paul that has taken so great labor to prove this cause? think you that you
shall be thus discharged a fore god? if you do / than goo boldly in to the
strayte judgment off god with this evasion / and doubt you not but there
shall you find. S. Paul as styfly and as strongly agenst you and your new
works as ever he was agenst the Iuys and their old works / and if he did
condemn the works of the law / that were institute by the mouth of god /
think you that those works that you have invented out of your idylle brain
shall be there a lowed? Breuely what works can you do / or excogitate (that
be good) which be not in the old law / Ergo he speaks of all manner of works
/ for ye law includythe all works that ever god instituted / but let me stope
your mouthis with. S. Paul. Does not he bring to prove his cause / the
example of the great father Abraham / whom no manner off works culde justify /
but faith only / think you that S. Paul does speak here of the works of ye
old law? nay doutles. For how could Abraham do the works of the law / and
there was no law given.iiij.C. and.xxx. years after? where fore S. paul
constrayneth you to conclude that no manner of good workis (though they be so
good as Abraham's workys) can help to iustificacio^. But yet you have a another
evasyon and that is of your gloss / how that S. Paul speaks of cerimonial
workys / how they do not Iustifye. Glossa.
This distynccyo^ is but for mad men / and for the^ yt be not lernyd which are
glad whane they may avoid holy scriptur / though it be notyng to purposse but
alonly with ydille and vain wordis I pray you what need S. paul to prove yt
the ceremonials did not iustyfy / was there ever any Iue yt lokyd to be
justified by the^? Nay doutles. For they were not geuyn to Iustificacion. where
fore what man would think yt S. Paul (except mad me^ and vnlernyd assis)
would take so great labor to prove yt thing / that every man did gravnt /
where fore say what you can Here stondith holy S. paul styfly and strongly for
me and against you and says that we be freely and alonly Justified by faith with
out allemaner of workis. Ambro ad Romans ^
But let us see what your own doctors say to this text S. Ambrose declarith
it on this manner. They are justified freely / for they doing nothing nor nothing
deseruyng / alo^ly by faith are justified by the gift of god etc^. here you
not / that me^ workinge nothing at al / nor nothing deserving / ar justified
by faith only / ye and that freely? you were wont to say that faith does
Iustifye / but not alonly and therefore would you cry / For. Sola. Sola. Sola.
only / only / only. Here have you him / and to help him you have also gratis
that is freely / and also dono de^ that is by the gift of god / and nihil
opera^tes that is workinge nothing at al. if these wordis do not exclude
workis and allow faith only / I can not tell what wordis will do it. And
lest yt S. Ambrose should not be sufficient in this cause / I will also bring
you Origyne on this same text whose wordis be these

Orig. ad Romans li. 3. cap. 3.
Paul says that the Iustificacion of faith is alonly sufficient. So that if a
man / do believe alonly he is iustifide though there be no workis done of him at
al / by faith was the thief iustifide with out the workis of the law /
wherefore a man is iustifide by faith / un to whom / as co^seruyng
iustificacion the workis of the law / help nothing etc^. What say you by
Origyn / that says how men be iustifyde / though they do no good workys at
all / for workis do help nothing to Iustificacio^ / but faith only Be not
these plain wordis / gravnt these wordis / and we will ask no more of you /
here have you also Sola. Sola. Sola. so that you need not Cry no more for
Sola. For you have more tha^ you can well a void / Also Origin bryngith an
opyn example of the thief that no man can deny who can have less good workis
than a theffe which is neither good before god nor man. Romans 9.
Also paul in the.ix. chapter bryngithe in the gentille / which knowithe
nothing of God / nor has done no good workis / but contrary blasphemyde god
/ and his holy name and has allways lyuyde in idolatrye and been an utter
enymy un to all goodness / he bringythe in also the Iue fulle of good works of
the law / which has also great zele to god / Romans 10.
and to his workis / ye and of that Paul beryth him wytnes breuely he
bryngith in for him such a Iue yt no man ca^ complain of / but is fulle of
good workis ye take all the best of the Iuys to gether (For it were madness for
paul to speak of the damnable iuys that were opyn wrechis and damnable by the
Judgment of the law) with all their good workis / and yet S. Paul does
exclude them and repellithe them clearly from iustificacion with all their good
zele / and with all their good workys and concludithe with plain wordis / that
the gentille which was fulle of damnable workis / and had neither zele nor love
un to goodness is justified by faith only / These be S. Paul's wordis. Romans 9.
We say that the gentilles which followyd not rightwysnes have obtenyd
ryghtwysnes I mean ye ryghtwysnes which comith of faith. But Israel which
folowyd ye law of rightwysnes / cold not attain unto rightwisnes / where
fore? because they sought it not by faith but as it were by ye workis of the
law. Be not these plain wordis that the gentilles which followyd no
rightwisnes / nor had no mind there un to / are Justified freely by faith? Is
not here. Sola fides / only faith? More over the Iue is repreuyd with all his
zele with all his love with all his study and with all his good workis. Is not
this a meruellous thing? yes verily. And so marvelous that you shall never
understand it with out you believe. But peradventure here shall be said that
the good works of the Iuys did not profit them / by cause they had no faith.
But if they had had faith / than would they help to their iustificacion. To
this I make answer / troth it is that good workys did not proufyt that Iuys
for want of faith / but this is false they workis should have help to
Iustificacio^ with faith For S. Paul prouythe clearly yt good workys help
nothing to Iustificacion nor eville workis let not the iustificacion that
comythe by faith / And this he prouyth by the exampille of the gentille /
which had no good workys but all evil and all damnable workys / and yet is
iustyfyed by faith.

Moreover the Iue has the zele of god and all manner of good workis with all
thing yt the world ca^ deuisse and all this could not help him where fore ye
glory of iustificacion remanyth only to faith. Also S. paul provithe plainly
in these wordis that workis have no place in Iustificacio^ / to him that
workyth is the reward not geuyn of favor but of deutye To him yt workythe not
/ Romans 4.
but beleuithe on him that Iustifythe the wikkyd man / is faith cou^tyd for
rightwysnes. How think you by these wordis? be they not opynly against al
workis? says he not that Iustyficacion is imputyd un to him that workith not
but alonly beleuythe in him that iustyfythe ye wykkyd man? I pray you what good
workis does the wikkyd man? Mark also how he says that ryghtwysnes is
ymputyd un to him / Ergo yt is not deseruyd. For yt that is deseruyd / is not
imputyd of favor / but it must be geuyn of dewty. How think you is not this
Sola fides only faith* you know yt there be but workis and faith yt do
Iustitie / and S. Paul excludythe workys clearly Ergo faith alone remaynith /
but paradventure you will say (As you be full of holy hypocrisye) that workis
with faith do Iustifye / Never the less of mekenes and lowlynes / and
avoydyng of al bost of your godnes you will give all ye glory to faith / as
unto the principalle thing and with out the which no workis can help / not
with stonding workis be good and do help to iustificacion / though of mekenes
you will not know it. Is not this damnble hypocrisy ye and that with god which
were intolerable if it were with men. But how can you prove by scripture that
this hypocrisy of youres is true / yt workis ar worthy of any glory of
iustificacion? Is not this opyn lying on faith to give all to him and yet (as
you say) he is not worthy off all? for workis be worthy of part / if faith
be not worthy alonly / Confess it opynly / and give workys his praise / and
faith her praisse / and say not one thing with your mouth and think another
in your hartis for god serchith the preuytis of hartis: who has requiryd off
you such a mekenes? who has desired that you should so lie on faith? what
ca^ your lies profit god? but I pray you how can workis help to Iustificacion
less or more / when they be nether done nor yet thought of? who is Justified
but a wykkyd man? which thynkythe nothing of good workis But these meke lies
deserve none a^swere wherefore let us hear what holy doctors say on this
text. Ambrosius
Saint Ambrose says on this manner / It was so decreyd of god / that after the
law / he should require unto salvation alonly the faith of grace. which
thing he prouith by the exampille of ye prophet sayng / Blessed is that man to
whom god does impute Iustificacion with out workis / he says that they be
blessid / of whom god has determyd with out labor / with out all manner of
obseruacion / allonly by faith yt they shall be iustifyde by fore god. Blessed
are they whose sins be forgeuen. Clearly they are blessed / un to whom with
out labor / or with out any work their iniquites be remitted and their sins
be covered and no manner of works required of them / but allonly that they
should believe. etc^.

Be not these words plain? God has decreyd that he shall requyer nothing to
iustificacion but faith / and he is blessed to whom God imputes iustificacion
with out all manner works / with out all manner of obseruacions / also their
sins be covered / and no manner of works of penance required of them but
allonly to believe / here have you Sola fides and tantu^ fides / and here can
you not say / that. S. Ambrose spekith alonly of works of the law / but of
all manner of works / of all manner of obseruacions / ye and also of penance.
Paraduenture you will say / as a great doctor said ons to me / D. wethe^all^
that. S. Ambrose did understand yt of young chylderne / that were newly
baptisyd / the^ their faith should save alonly with out works.

How think you is not this a lykely answer for a great doctor of divinity /
for a great duns man? for so great a preacher? are not. S. Paul and. S. Ambrose
well avoided and clarkely? But I made him this obieccion / that this Epistle
was written of. S. Paul to the Romans / which were men and no chyldern and
also the words of scripture speak of the man and not of the child / and. S.
Ambrose says blessed is that man / but at this obieccion / he was not a
lytylle moved / but swear by the blessed god / let Ambrose / and Austyne say
what they will / he would never believe but that works did help to
iustificacion. This was a lordly word off a prelat / and of a pyllar of
christ's church / but what medlinge is with such mad men. But yet paraduenture
you will say / as you were wont to do (when you can not a void a plain
saying of a doctor) how that I take a piece off the doctor / as much as
makes for my purposse / notwithstonding he says otherwisse in another place
which I do not bring. what is that to me / yet is not my doctor thus a voyded
/ for you can not deny / but this is his sayng / and a pone this place of
scriptur / and this does a gre with scriptur / or else he does expound
scriptur evyll / wherefore you must answer / to the saying of the doctor in
this place / for this is the place that is laid a genst you and this is the
place / where by other places must be expounded and yff you dare deny him in
this place than will I deny him in all other places / by that same auctorite
(than be the holy doctors clearly gone. Never ye less holy scripture stondeth
opynly agenst you which if you deny I will not alonly prove you heretykes /
but I will also accuse you of heresy / wherefore take heed what you do / but
yet paraduenture you will (as you be very lordly) say that I understand not.
S. Ambrose nor holy doctors / as my lord off Rochester said / how I
understood not Tertulyan / he had no another evasyon to save his honor with /
but this is not enough so to say / but you must prove yt and other men must
judge yt) by twene you and me / here have I translated a great many off the
saynges off doctors in to English / let other men judge whether I
understand them or none / Go ye to the lattyn and let us se what other sense
you can take out / but I say boldly un to you all / and you shall also find
yt true (if we may be in dyfferently hard) that all you too gether / shall
have but lyttylle Judgment in those things that be in lattyn which I do not
understand. This do I say not too boste my self / but to provoke you to
dispute / and to show what you can do agenst these artycles and in proving
that I understand not the doctors / in these causys. I mean that you must
prove yt / by learning / and not by your old tyranny. Now if you will save
your honor / fly not a way from lernyng / un too violence / But make
request unto our most noble prince mekely that both you and I may be hard in
differently / and if you overcome me than are you at a short conclusion in all
these matters / And in time to come / doubt you not but every man will beware
of them / But if you will not do this / but take you to your old cruelle
vyolence yet remember that god stondeth agenst you / and all the world may
openly know / that you have not the holy veryte / but the damnable wrong / ye
and that mayntayned / with extreme violence and tyranny / by the which thingys
/ the Great Turk / and infidelles and also deuylles of hell / are abylle (if
they be suffered) to prove that they have ye verite. But my lords remember /
yt our god is alive whose cause we defend / a fore who^ I dare well say / you
are already co^fou^dyd in your co^scye^s wherefore doubt you not but that
terebille vengeance hangs over you / which when yt comes / comes shortly.
How are you abyll to defend a thing / that you ca^ not prove openly by holy
scripture? Say what you will your conscience will murmur and grudge and will
never besatisfide with men's dremis / nor yet with tirannye. Think you that
your lawis and your inuencions can be a sufficyent rule for christen men to
live by? and too save their conscience thereby? Think you / that your cause is
suffycyently prouyd when you have co^pellyd pore men by violence to grant it?
Than may we dystroye all scripturs / and reseue allonly your tyranny. But my
lordis this matter is not rightyd by your Judgment / but by our Master
Christ's and his blessed word / a fore whose strayte judgment / you shall be
judged / and that straytely. For wha^ all your grace / all your honor / al
your dignite / al your po^pe and pride / breuely al yt your hearts do now
rejoice in shall lie in ye dust / than shall you be called to a strayte
reckoning: it is no light game nor no chyldys play. Mark it well for it lithe
in your neck. but what nedyth me to lose many wordis / for if you be half so
full of grace / as you say you be of good workys / than will you rekkyn yt
better than I can move you. But a gain to our pourposse. Saint Paul prouythe
the iustifycacyon of faith only / in these words. Gala. 2.
No man is Justified by the workis of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ
/ and we do believe in Jesus Christ / that we may be Iustyfyde / by the faith
of Christ / and not by the workys of the law? How think you / does not Saint
Paul exclude workys and bring in allonly faith / ye and that the workis of
the law which were the best workys in the world: and he believes to be
Justified only by ye faith of Jesus Christ / and not by workis / and that
prouyth he in these wordis / Gala. 3.
That no man is iustifyde by ye law a for god it is manifest / for a
rightwisma^ liuyth by faith. Here you not how a rightwyse man lyuyth by
faith? what call you living by faith? if he live any part by workis / tha^
liuith he not by faith but partly by works / Tha^ is Saint paulys probacyon
imperfect. But let us se how your doctors do expound this text. Athanasius
Gala. 3.
Now does he plainly show / that faith allonly has the virtue in him to
iustyfy / and bringyth abacuk saying / of faith (and not of the law) shall a
rightwyse man live / he adds well a fore god / for a fore man peradventure
they shall be rekkenyd ryghtwyse / yt stykke to the law / but not a fore god.
etc^. Here have you Sola. Only. And also yt this holy Iustificacyon is a fore
god / and after his Judgment / and not after me^nys Judgment. wherefore glory
as much as you can of your good workys / They ca^ not alonly not Iustyfye you
/ But also they be of no valor but damnable and very sin / if there be no
faith / So for are they from helpyng too iustificacyon. August. in prologo.
Psalm. 31.
This does. S. Augustyne wytnes in these wordys. Those same workys yt be done
a fore faith / though they seem un to men laudable / yet are they butt vain /
And I do Judge them / as great strength / and as swyfte runninge out of ye
way. where for let no man count his good workys by fore faith / where as
faith is not there is no good work / the intencyon makythe a good work / but
faith do the gyde yt intencyon. etc^.

Here Augustyne conde^neth all your good workys a fore faith / and says
that they be nothing worth / But vain and things out of the way / How can
such things help too Iustifiacyon? Mark also how yt your good intencyon
(where upon you bost that you do so many good workys by it) can not help you
for heys blind and knowythe not what to do (though he stond weell in his own
conseyte) with out faith which is his gyde. So that all things a fore faith
are but very blyndnes But as soon as faith comes / he does both Iustyfy and
also makes the workys good / which were a fore sin, But my lordys / you
think to Iustyfy men a fore god / as you do fulfill your office a fore the
world / that is by workys of hypocrysy / and by works that have ye name of
holiness / and not the deed / and by vain and glorious namys / and with your
vain blessyngys and sanctificacions / and with your damnable pardons / and
with your whysling absolucyons / by such workys as these be that have but ye
shadow of holiness and in deed be but sin / Think you to satissefye god / like
wysse as with your bostinge and crakinge and with proud lokis and with your
hie thretni^ges and with your gorgius po^pe and pride / you do make ye world
believe yt you be ye very successors of peter and paul wha^ in very deed you
are ye very Antychrystys yt Scriptur speaks of / and yt ye world has lokid
so long for / And yet so mad be we to look for Antichrist / wha^ he is long
come in to the game place and plays his part to the vttermoost. For let any
man that lokythe for Antychryste tell me what Antychryste shall do when he
comes / that you do not openly / and yet will you be Christ's bisshops / So
that pore Christ must bear in his nek / all your damnable and a bomynable
living. But let us se what Saint Barnarde says off good workys. I do
abhor (says he) what soever thing is of me / Barnar. super Can. sermo. 67
except paradventure / that that be mine that god has made me his. By grace
has he iustyfyed me freely / and by that has he delivered me from the bondage
of sin. Thou haste not chosyn me (says christ) but I have chosen the / nor I
found no merits in the / that might move me to chosse the / but I prevented
all thy merits. where fore thus by faith have I married the un to me / and not
by the works of the law. I have married yt also in justice / but not in the
justice of the law / but in that justice which is of faith. Now this remaynythe
/ that thou do judge a right judgment by twene the and me / give thou
judgment where in that I have married the / where yt is open that thy merits
did not come by twene / but my pleasure and will etc^. S. Barnard does dispyse
all his good works and takythe him only to grace / but you stycke partly to
your works and not allonlye to grace / had. S. Barnarde no good works to
stycke to? And yet he says that there was no merits / nor any goodness / but
that we were freely chosen. wherefore he prouokyth you and all such as you be /
to judge ryghtwisely by twene god and you / the which has prevented al your
goodness / and that of his own will and off his own pleasure / how can he
find any goodness / that preuentythe all goodness? So that here have you clearly
/ that good works off the law / or moral good works as you feign / do
nothing help to iustificacion / for they be prevented of iustificacion. This
is also well provyd by. Augus. de Spiri. et ^it. cap. 12.
S. Augustyn / saying. wherefore these things considered and declared after
the strength / yt it has plesed god to give us / we do gether that a man can
not be iustifyde / by the preceptis off good living / that is / not by the law
of works / but by the law off faith / not by the letter / but by the sprete
not by the merits of works / but by fre grace. etc^. Here you this? Not by
merits of works but by fre grace / what call you fre grace / but with out all
things saving grace / what call you not off works / but that works help
nothing. For if works did help / tha^ would he not say / not of works but
not of works only / but part of works and part of faith / but he excludes
works fully / and only. Again ye same thing that purchessythe us remission
of our sins / does also purchesse iustificacion / for iustificacion is
nothing but remission of sins. Now faith purchessith us remission of sins /
ergo by faith be we iustifyde Now that faith does purchesse remission of
sins / yt is well provyd by this article of our faith / credo remissionem
peccatorum / I believe remission of sins / now if I have not this remission
for faith than faith disseuythe me / for I do believe alonly / because I would
have remission of sins / what needs me to believe remission of sins / if I
may deserve yt by works? also our master Christ declarythe openly that no
manner of works what so ever they be can justify a fore god. These be his
words / when you have done all things that be commandid you yet say that we
are unprofitable servants if you be unprofitable than be you not iustifyd /
Luce. 17
and if you can not be iustifide when you have done all things / how will you
be justified wha^ you do in a manner nothing / and specially off those that be
commandyd you / wherefore this is plain that your works can not help you to
iustificacion / for when you have done all ye^ are you un profitable.

But let us prove this by an open example. I put this case my lords (un to
you I speak) yt our most noble prince would call you all a fore him and say /
my lords so yt is that it has plesyd us to call you unto the spiritual
dignite of bisshopes / and to make you of our council / and lords of our
royalme and also of our parliament / how would we know of you / which of you
all has deserved yt or rekkeneth him self worthy by his deseruyng less or
more of this dignite / what will you say to this? what will you answer to
the kings grace? Is there one among you all / that dare be so bold / as to
say to the kings grace that he has not given yt unto him freely / but that
he has done the king so faithfulle service that he was bound to give yt un
to him ye and that of his deseruyng / If there were one yt were so proud (as
doutles you be presumptuous enough) as to say this / think you that the kings
grace would not lay to his charge / how that he had not done half his dewty /
but were rather bound / to do ten times as much more / and yet the kings
grace were not bound to give him a bisshoperyke / for he hade done but his
duty / and not all that / now yff your good works and all your faithfulle
seruys / be not abylle to deserve a bisshoperyke off the kings grace / how
will you be abylle by your works / to deserve heaven and iustificacyon a fore
the king of all kings? when you have answered to this a fore the kings grace
/ than come and dispute with god the iustificacion of your works / and yet
shall they be sore un like. wherefore I conclude of these scriptures / and off
these doctors that the faith that we have in Christ Ihesus / and in his
blessed blood does alonly and sufficiently iustefye us a fore god with out the
help off any works.

And though that all scripture be nothing else / but a holle probacion of this
artikell (that is alonly a perfyte commendacion and a praise of christ and of
his blessed merits / that he has deserved for us) yet will I pass over to
bring in any mo places / for they that are not content with these scriptures
will not be satisfied nor yet content to give alonly glory to God / though I
brought in all the new testament / ye christ him self could not satisfy
them yff he were here / no nor yet though heaven and earth and all creatures
there in / were nothing else but probacions of this article / yt would not
help.

Where fore I let such infideles pass and leave them to the judgment of god
/ alonly certyfyenge them of this one thing that is infallyble how the day
shall come / that yt shall repent them / ye and that sorar than I can either
write or think / that they did not believe the least prycke of holy scripture
but un to our purposse.

The very true way of iustificacyon is this / The manner of iustificacion
first comythe God for the love of Christ Ihesus / and alonly of his mere
mercy / and geuythe us freely the gift of faith where by we do believe God and
his holy word / and stycke fast un the promyses off God / and believe that
though heaven / and earth and all that is in them should perish and come to
naught / yet god shall be found true in his promises: for this faithes sake
be we the elect childern of god. This is not such a faith as men dreme / when
they believe that there is won god / and believe that he is eternalle / believe
also that he made the world of naught ye and believe that the gospelle is true
/ and all thing yt god speakyth must be true and fulfyllyd / with other such
things / This I say is not the faith that we be iustifide by / for the
infideles have this faith / and also we may attain to these things / by the
strength of reason / but the faith that shall iustifye us / must be of a another
manner strength / for yt must come from heaven / and not from the strength of
resone. It must also make me believe that god the maker of heaven and earth is
not alonly a father / but also my father: ye and that through the favor that
Christ has purchesyd me / from the which favor / neither heuyn nor earth /
tribulacion nor persecucion / death nor hell can deuyde me / but to this
stycke I fast / that he is not alonly my father / but also a merciful father
/ ye and that un to me mercifulle / and so mercifulle / that he will not
impute my sins un to me / Though they be never so great (so long as I hang
on the blessed blood of Christ Jesus) he is also a lyberalle father / ye and
that un to me lyberalle / which will not alonly promise me al things / but
also give them me whether they be necessary to the body or to the soul. He is
also not alonly lyberalle / but mighty to perform all things that he
promisyth un to me. Breuely this faith makes me to hang clearly off god and
off his blessed promisis and not too fere death nor none afflyccion / nor
persecucions / nor tribulacion / but too dispysse all these things / and not
allonly these / but to dispisse also mine own self / mine own body / mine
own life for Christ's sake. Finallye of a fleshely best it makes me a
spiritual man / of a damnabille child / yt makes me a heavenly sone / Of a
servant of the deuell / yt makes me a fre man of godys / both delivered from
the law / from sin / from d^the / fro the deuell / and from all mysery that
might hurt me My lords this is the faith that does Justify / and be cause
it is given from heaven in to our hartis by the sprete off god / therefore it
can be no ydille thing / But it must nedis do all manner of thingis / that be
too the honor off god / and also to the profit of our neyboure / in so much
that at all tymis necessary yt must nedis work well / and also bring forth
all good works / that may be to the profitte and helping off any man. But
these workys be not done / too Iustifye the man / but a just man must needs do
them / Not unto his profit / but allonly to other men's profits / even as our
Master Christ / suffered hunger and thurst / and persecucion and took great
labors in preachinge of his word / ye and also suffered death all these
things I say did he not to further or to profit him self / But for our
merit and for our profytt / so likewise does a Just man his works. And as a
good tree in time off year brings forth a god appylle / not to make him good
for he is good a fore / nor yet this appyl is not to his profyt / But un to
other men's not withstondinge the good nature that is in him must nedys bring
yt forth / so likewise the Just man must nedys do good workys / not by them
to be Iustyfyde / but allonly in them to serve his brother: for he has no
need of them / as consernynge his Iustyfycacyon. wherefore now here have you
the very true cause off Iustyfycacyon / that is faith allonly / And also the
very true way and manner of doing good workis / And how yt no man can do good
workis but a Justified man / As our Master Christ says / either make the tree
good and tha^ his fruit most be good / Mat. 7.
Or else ye tree evil and his fruit also evil for a good tree must nedys
bring forth good fruit / And a bad / evell fruit. But now let me answer to
their scrypturs and too their carnal reasons that they bring to prove that
workys do Iustyfye.

Solueto^s to ye scripture which they falsely allege
First comes the flesslye and damnable reason / And the says if we be
Iustyfyde allonly by faith what need we to do any good workis what need we to
crucyfye or to mortyfye our flesh / for all these will not profytt us / and
we shall be sauyd though we do none of them al. Thus did blind reason dispute
with Saint Paul when that he had prouyd / that god off his mere marcy / had
delivered us freely from the damnable bondage off the law / A none he Judged
that he might do what he would / for he was no longer underneath the law / To
this Saint Paul answers / that if we obey un to the workys of sin / than
are we the seruauntys off sin / and yff we obey to the workys off Iustys than
are we the servants off Iustys / so that yff we truly have that same faith
that Iustyfythe us / we shall desyere too do no another workys but those that
belong too Iustyfycacyon / not that the workys do Iustyfye us / but that we
must nedys do these workys / as the very true frutys off Iustificacyon / and
therefore those men yt will do no good workys by cause they be Iustyfyde alonly
by faith / be not the chylderne of god nor the chylderne of Iustyfycacyon /
and of that is this a suer and an euydent token / for if they were the very
true chylderne off god / they would be the gladder to do good workys / by
cause that they are Iustyfyed freely. Therefore should they also be mouyd freely
to work / yff yt were for no another purposse / nor profit / but allonly to
do the will off their mercyfulle god / that has so freely Iustyfyed them /
and also to profit their neyboure / whom they are bound to serve of very true
cheryte.

Take an exampell / here is a thief that is condemnyd by right and by law to be
hangyd whom the kyngis grace of his mercy / does freely delyuere from the
gallous / and geuythe him his pardon / Now this thief thus delivered will not
keep him self a true man nor do those workys that belong to a true man to do
/ but fallyth again to stelynge by cause the king perdonyd him so freely / and
rekenyth that the king is so merciful that he will hang no theuys but
deliver them all of his mercy with out their deseruyng / Now how think you
will the king be marcyfull un to this thief when he comythe again to the
gallous? nay truly / but yff he had done those things that the kyngys pardon
deseruyd / than had he come no more in danger / but should have been still in
the kyngys fauou^e. The^ comes my lord off Rochester / and he says ye faith
does be gynne a Iustyfycacyon in us / But workys do perform yt and make yt
parfyt / and by cause that no man shall think that I lay yt un to him
vnrightwisly I will resyte his own words. Arti. 1.
Per fidem initiari dicitur iusticia solu^ / non aute^ co^summari na^
co^su^mata iusticia no^ aliter qua^ exoperibus natis / et in luce^ editis
acquiri potest / Opera co^summate iustifica^t / Fides primu^ inchoat. etc^.
What christenyd man would think that a bisshope would thus triffylle and play
with godys holy word? Godys word is so plain / that no man can avoyde yt
how that faith Iustyfythe allonly / and now commyth my lord of Rochester /
with a little and a vain dystynccyon inuentyd of his own brain with out
auctoryte of scripture and will clearly / a void all scrypturs / and all the
holle dysputacyon of Saint Paul. But my lord / Say to me of your conscience
how do you rekkyn to a void the vengeance off god / sith you thus tryfyll and
despise godys holy word? Think you that this vain distinccyon / will be
alowid before Jesus christ for whose glory we do contend and strive and a fore
whom we do ha^dylle this matter I do thynk verily / yt your own conscience
does sore accuse you for thus blasphemynge ye holy word off god / wherefore my
lord for Christ's sake remember that you be agyd and shall not long tarry
here / and these vain dystinccions that you have inuentyd too the pleasure of
men / And to the great peruertynge of godys holy word shall be to your
everlasting damnacion. And at the lest wais if you sere not ye terribyll
vengeance of god / remember the shame of this world / and think not that all
men be so mad and so unlearned / as for to be disseuyd by this tryflyng
distinctyon Seeing that the word of god is so plain against it / Ephe. 2.
Does not Saint Paul say that our iustifycacion is alonly of faith / and not
of workys? How can you avoid this same / Non ex operibus / Not of works? if
that workis do make Iustificacion perfyt / tha^ are not Saint paul's wordys
true. Also S. paul says / that we be the chylderne of god by faith / and if
we be the chyldern we are also ye heirs. Now what imperfeccion find you in
chyldern and in heirs? Christen men desyer no more but this / and all this
have they by faith only / and will you say that faith does but begin a
Iustifycacyon? Besides that you know well that S. paul does prove in all the
holle pistle ta the Romanys and also to the Galathyans / that faith does
justify / ye and that by contencyon agenst works / Now how can you bring in
workis to make iustificacion perfy^t / and. S. paul has excludyd them.
Moreover / why did not ye Iues agenst whose workis. S. paul disputith / bring
in this distinccion for them / breuely what will you say to all the doctors
that I have here resytyd which say that Sola fides / only faith does
iustifye / but doutles if you were not a lord this distinction were not worthy
off an answer. A another damnable reason have you that is an opyn and a plain
lie / which is this Thou saiste that works do not justify / nor yet help
to Iustificacion but faith only Ergo thou dystroyest all good works and wylt
that no man shall work well / but alonly believe. I answer if there were any
shame in you / you might well be a shamed of these open lies / Tell me one that
is learned / that ever did say or learn / that men should do no good workys.
Many there be that say workis do not Iustifye / As Saint Paul and all his
scolars / but no man denythe good works / But I mervell not at you / for you
do but the workis off your father / which was a liare and a mutherar from the
begenyng I pray you what consequent is this after your own logyke / works do
not Iustifye / Ergo we neade not to do them / but dyspysse them: for they be
off no value / Take a like consequent / you say that the kyngis grace does not
Iustifi Ergo you dysspyse him / Ergo he is no longer king / Also the son and
moan do not Iustyfye Ergo you dystroye them / but such a damnable lie must
Saint Paul nedis suffer / when he had provyd that faith only did Iustyfy /
Tha^ came your ouerthwaert fathers / and said Ergo thou distroyest the law /
for thou lernest that yt Justifies not / God forbid says Saint Paul / for
we do learn the very way to fulfylle the law / Roma. 3.
that is faith / where by ye law alonly is fulfyllyd and with out the which
/ all the workis of the law be but sin / So do we likewise learn the very
true way where by that all good works must be done As first a man by faith
to be Justified and than a Just man / must needs do good works which a fore
were but sin / and now be all good / ye his eatinge / drinking and
slepinge are good.

But by side all these have you sertyn scripturs. Iaco. 2.
First of Saint James / whose words be these. Vvilte thou understand o thou
vain man / that faith with out dedis is deed / was not Abraham our father
Justified of his dedis when he offeryd his sone Isaac on the Altar / Likewise
/ was not Raab the harlot Iustyfyed when she reseuyd the Mesengers / and sent
the^ out a another way? I answer / if I denied this pystelle to be Saint Iamys
/ you could not prove yt by the auctoryte of the church / for she has
allways douted of yt / as yt is open / In ecclestica hystoria. More over / I
have invynsible scrypturs to prove that yt can not be. Li. 2. cap. 23. Li. 3.
Ca. 25.
Saint James. First where he bryngythe that Abraham was Iustyfyed by offering
of his sone Isaac / That is clean contrary / First un to Moses / where as the
very orygynall is / For yt is openly declared. Gene the xv. chapter where these
wordys were spoken off Abraham / James pistle is improued
Abraham did believe / and yt was reputyd too him for Iustyfycacyon where there
is no word of Isaac / for he was neither borne / nor yet promised / and yet
Abraham must nedys be Justified for the holy ghost says yt / and when the
wordys were spoken too him of Iustyfycacyon he was at the most / but.lxxxvi.
yearys old / as yt is declared in the.xvi. chapter / But when Isaac was
promisyd him by name / Than was he.xcix yerys old / as it is opyn in the.xvij.
chapter / And the year after was Isaac borne / and when Isaac was borne / was
Abraham an.C. years old as yt is plain in the.xxi. chapter / Now would I
know off you that will defend this Epystylle / where by that Abraham was
Iustyfyed / from that he was.lxxxvi. yearys old till he was an. C. years old?
you can not say by offering off Isaac for you se that he is not borne.

Moreover Isaac must be off lawfulle age a fore that his father did offer him /
and at the lest he was seven yearys old / for he could speak perfyttly / and
say to his father / be hold / here is fire and stykkys where is the oblacio^
/ as yt is open the.22. chapter / now how will you justify Abraham in the mean
time / from lxxxvj. yeris old / till an.C. and from an.C. till ye offeringe of
Isaac which at the lest was seve^ yerys / so that Abraham must nedis be
justified xxj. yerys before he offered his sone / ergo by that work was he not
iustifyde.

Moreover in the.xxij. chapter. where he did offer his sone is there never a
word spoken off iustificacion / which must nedis have been spoken yff he had
therefore been iustifyde / but alonly is there said / now do I know that thou
fearyst god / which is an effect and a work of iustificacion / and no cause of
iustificacion. Moreover the Macabytes bring the same exampylle of Abraham that
his faith was imputed un to him for iustificacion. 1. Mac^ 2.
Also. S. Paul of whose auctory and learning no christian man does douce /
bryngythe the same example both to ye Romans and to the Galathyans to pro^e
that faith only did iustifye Abraham a fore the birth of Isaac / which does
plainly sygnify that he would prove that Abraham was iustifyd a fore / and with
out the offering of Isaac / also in the pystylle to the hebrews is yt open
that Abraham was justified by faith only / ye and that long a fore Isaac was
borne. Furthermore as concerning the example of Raab / yt is open in the book
of Iosue that she did say these words unto the messengers / Iosue. 2
I do know that the lord shall give you this land / for truly there is a
great fear come a pone us / and all the dwellers of this land do pyne away
for sorrow. we have herd that the lord. has dried up the re^ see a fore your
entering in whane you came out of Egypt / we have hard what things you have
done to the two kings of ye amorites. etc^. your lord god is he the which
is in heaven above / and in earth bynethe / wherefore swear you un to me that as
I have showed you mercy / yt you shall lykewysse do un to me and un to my
fathers howssold* etc^. Be not these words off a great faith? Does not she
believe the promyses of god? and of that faith she reseued the mesengers / or
else she had never reseyued them / and of that faith she requierythe also mercy
/ wha^ god has fulfilled his promise / wherefore of this faith was she
iustifyde / and this faith made here to do well un to the mesengers / Hebr. 11.
therefore says the epistle to the hebrews / That Raab ye harlot through faith
did not peryshe with the unbelieving persons. Here may you se that Moses / and.
S. Paul and other places of scripture do expound these scripturs contrary to
your epistle / and that not with darcke wordis but with so plain words that
no christen man can say the contrary. wherefore I can not believe that you are
abylle to defend this pistle to be S. Iamesys / but notwithstonding al these
things / I will grant you this pystle to be of auctorite that you may have
some thing to dispute with / what will you conclude out of that / that works
do justify? That were sore agenst christ's blood / for than did christ dye
invayne / Aug. 8^. q. c. 76.
it is also agenst the exposicio^ of. S. Augustyn / whose words be these. S.
Paul says that a man may be justified by faith with out any works going by
fore iustificacyo^ / but wha^ a man is justified by faith / how can he but
work well though that he before workinge nothing right wysly is now come to
the iustificacio^ of faith not by merits of good works but by the grace of
god / the which grace in him / now can not be ydylle seeing that now through
love he works well. And yff he depart out of this lyffe after that he
beleuythe / ye iustificacion of faith abydythe by him / not by his works
going a fore iustificacio^ / for by his merits came he not un to that
iustificacion but by grace / nor by his works that follow iustificacion / for
he is not suffered to live in this lyffe / wherefore paul and Iamys be not
contrary for Paul spekythe of works that go by fore faith / and Iamys
speaks off the works that follow the iustificacio^ of faith. etc^.

Here have you plain that. S. Augustyne says that no manner of works /
neither that goo by fore neither that come after help to iustificacion but
allonly they follow iustificacion / and a just man must needs do good works.
Here have you also / that. S. James speaks of works that follow iustificacyon
and not of works that help to justify for there be none such.

Here have you also that the iustificacion off faith is so parfytt that yt
saves a man only the which is agenst my lord of Rochesters dystynacion / for
if works did make perfytt iustificacion / than a man could not be saved with
out the perfeccion of works / wherefore yt will be hard for my lord of
Rochester to save his honestye. S. Augustine is so open against him but I fear
me that the proverb that a wysse man did wons learn me (whane men are come to
great honor they do so much regard yt yt clearly they for get all honesty)
will here be found to true.

Also you have a another scripture for you which is this By fore god they are
not justified which here the law but they which do ye law shall be justified
/ of this text you glory / and cry opera / opera / works / works / Romans 2.
but if you would consider the mind of. S. Paul you should well perseue /
that he menyth not how works should deserve iustificacion / for than could
not he have concluded this agenst the Iuys for they did the works of the law
to the utter most and yet ware they not iustifyde / wherefore. S. Paul menyth
by the herers of the law all them that do the utter works of the law for
fere / or for reward / or of hypocrisy / or else by them to be justified: the
doars callyth he the^ that do the works of the law after the intent of the
law / and as the law commands them / that is in the true faith off Christ
Ihesus / which is the very end of the law an^ the fulfyllynge of the law
(as. S. Paul says) to all them that believe. wherefore all men be but
hearers allonly of the law / tylle the time that they have the faith of
Christ Ihesus / which is imputed unto them for justice / and the works of the
law be no cause of iustificacyon / but allonly an outward testimonye and
wytnes yt the law is fulfilled inwardly in their conscie^s a fore God and so
fulfyllyd yt it has no accasacio^ against the^ for christ has made
satisfaccion for them / of the which they be pertakers by their faith / and so
the law must be content to admytt all these men to be fulfyllars and doars of
the law. Au. despi^^ lit.
And now that you shall not say that this is my dreme / here be. S. Augustines
words / the doars of the law shall be justified / so must yt be understand
that we may know / that they can no another wysse be the doars of the law
except they be first justified not that iustificacio^ belongyth un to doars but
that iustificacion does precede all manner of doing. etc^.

Here you not that iustificacion is first given that men might be abylle to do
the works of the law? Glossa
This is also the exposicion of your commen gloss / I have mervelle you study
yt no better.

Also you have a another scripture / and that is this / Cornelius a gentylle did
great alms / and prayed unto god all ways / Acto. 10
unto whom yt angelle spoke on this manner. Thy prayars and thy allmesses are
come up in to remembrance in the presens of god / of this text you gether
that his good works did help to justify him / I answer the holy ghost has
opinlie declared him self there / for he says that this Cornelius was a
deuote man and one that feryd god / how could this be with out that God had
taught him inwardly by faith / ye how could he know god and that deuotely /
but by faith? Ergo he was justified a fore god by his faith / but the world
knew not his iustificacion / and therefore yt holy ghost does declare his
inward iustificacion when he says yt he was deuote and feryd god and also
does show opynly ye fruits of this Iustificacion / when he says that he did
allemesse. Moreover you have there that the holy ghost fell on them a fore they
were baptisyd in watter the which declarythe opynly that they were Iustifide a
fore god / This is well declared also in your own law whose words be these
/ Cornelius Centurio / 2. q. 7 No^ o^nes Episcopi.
being yet a hethen man / was Iustifyde by the gift of the holy ghost. here
have you plainly that he was Justified by the gift of ye holy ghost a fore all
good workis / For he was an hethyn man. A another scriptur ye have which is
this / if I have all faith / So that I may transeposse mon^tayns and have no
cheryte I am nothing / of this gether you that faith with out cheryte can not
Justify / I answer This can you not gether of S. paul for it is opyn that he
spekyth not of that thing where by that men may be justified / but allonly he
techith how they that be justified must work with cherite: it is also plain
that he spekith not of faith that does Iustifye inwardlye / but of that faith
that does work outwardly The which is callid a gift of the holy ghost / as
the gift of tongues / The gift of prophicyes / ye gift of healing / the gift
of interpretacion / as it is opyn in the chapter a fore Now this faith is not
geuyn to Iustefye / but allonly to do miracles / wonders and sygnys by / and
therefore says paul / if I had all faith so that I could move mou^tayns.
Mat. 7.
Also it is opyn that sertyn men shall say un to Christ be hold we have done
miracles and cast out deuyles in thy name and yet he shall say to the^ /
truly I know you not / So yt this faith is a gift of god that iustifythe not
/ no more than the gift of sciens or prophicies And sometime is it in the
church and some time not / and yt is never of necessite there to be / but the
faith that we speak of which does believe the promyses of God / and styckythe
fast to the blessed blood of Christ / has no another virtue but to iustifye /
and must needs justify where so ever he is / and he stycketh so fast to gods
word / that he lokyth for no miracles. This faith is never out of the church /
Joan. 17.
for yt is the lyffe of the church / and yt is ye faith that our master
Christ prayed for yt yt might never fail / and therefore S. Paul when he
describythe this faith / he calls yt a faith that works by cheryte / not
that yt iustyfyeth by cherite / for as he says there plainly / Gala. 5.
yt is neither circumcision / nor yet vncircumsicion that is of any vallure in
christ Jesus / but faith. Here does he plainly exclude from iustificacion the
highest work of the law circumcision / and sets faith alone: not the gift of
faith that does miracles / but the gift of faith that works by cheryte /
and that you shall not think this to be my dreme here bring I you Athanasius
whose words be these.

Atha. ad Romans
There are.ij. manner of faithys won is justifying as that of the which it is
spoken / thy / faith has saved the / A another is called the gift of god
where by miracles be done / of the which yt is written if you have faith as a
grain of musterd sede. etc^.

So yt here have you plain that faith does justify only / and parfyttly / a
fore all manner of works / that is / faith is given of god freely in to our
souls un to the which faith iustificacyon is allonly promised and is alonly
imputed and rekkened of god / never the less this faith in time and place
convenient / is of that strength yt he must needs work by cheryte / not for to
be iustifide there by / for if he were not a fore iustyfyed / yt were not
possible that he could have cheryte / for after your own scolle men an
infidelle can not have cheryte / but that he is a freseruant unto god for the
love that he has unto him / the which love seeks not in god his own
profytte nor his own advantage / for than were he wykked but seeks alonly the
will off god and the profit of other men / and works neither / for love of
heaven nor yet for fere of hell / for he knows well that heaven / with all the
Ioys there of is preared for him from ye begenynge of the world / not by him /
but by his father and yt must needs follow: as contrary wysse the infydelle and
the wykked man does not work his wykked deeds / by cause he would have hell
or everlasting damnacion to his reward / but he would rather the contrary /
not withstondinge / hell and everlasting damnacion must needs follow his
wykked deeds.

Finallye a ryghtwyse man is a fre servant of gods / and works not as an
hyerelyng for if it were possible that there were no heaven yet would he do no
less good / for his respect is to ye maker and the lord of all rewards.

Now most excele^t and gracious prince / yt is not unknown unto all the
world that my lords the bisshops have purchesed your grace this tytylle to
be defender off the faith / our lord strength your grace that you may
perform yt / nothwithsto^ding there was never none of all ye bisshops / yt
would take so great pain for your graces sake / as to declare what was the
very true faith which your grace was bound to defend / but they left your
grace as a man shyt in a dark housse that would feign come out / but he cold
not find the door for want of light. So like wysse / they gave un to your
grace The tytylle of defendyng the faith / but they never declared what it was
/ but all ways left your grace to the name of faith and to the old opynio^
that went of faith but never clearly set out what it wasse / where fore most
nobille prince / for to declare my true and faithfulle service that I have un
to your most noble hyenes I have taken the labors and paynys / to the
uttermost power of my small gift to declare this artykille / so plainly and
so stronglye / not alonlye by the heuynly word of god / but also by the
clarkely exposicions of holy doctors / that no faythefulle man ca^ have any
place to doubt in it / wherefore most excelent prince with all humble subieccion
/ and with all due honor and reverence / I beseech your grace to reseue
graciously my faithefulle and true heart. For if I could do your noble grace
any better service (It should not be undone. Now do I not doubt but that your
grace will defend this pore and sympille labor of mine / from the vyolence
of the bishops) that they shall not condemn it by tyranny / nor with out
learning as their manner is to do / and for that cause have I dedicatyd the
holle book / unto your most noble grace / unto whom it can not be un knowyn /
how greatly it were agenst your honor to suffer ye bishops to condemn by
tyranny with out reason and lerninge so plain scripturs of god and so clear
exposicions of holy doctors. How were your grace abille to answer to it a
fore the dreadful trone of christ Jesus? This present lyffe is short / and
sone faylythe us / but if we suffer the godly word / of the everlasting God to
be ouertrodyn and oppressed by vyolence / there remaynythe nothing to us but
everlastynge woe and damnacion / for we are lost for ever. For ever is a great
time and god will not be mokkyd / for as the holy ghost says / if we do
dispisse so great health how shall we escape? Hebr. 2. Ibide^. 10.
also in a another place / it is an horrible and a ferfulle thing to fall in
the ho^dys of the living god where fore I doubt not but that your grace will
more regard the holy verite of christ Jesus and also your soulle health /
than any out ward shynynge of this dysseuable world And here by this present
wrytinge do I offer my self un to your most nobylle grace to prove all
thyngys that I have here written agenst ye bisshops and all manner of men that
will hold with them in this cause / ye and that under the pain that your
most noble grace shall set this do I not to prefer mi self / but alonly yt
I can not suffer the glorious blood of christ Jesus to be extynctyd and trodyn
under the foot by vyolence. I requyer no defense of none evil cause / but
alonly I requyer your graces favor and defense from vyolence and oppression
as god is my Judge who preserve your most Noble and excellent grace to his
pleasure and honor ever Amen

what so ever thing that was agreabylle with ye church / of yt had they never
a crumme but allonly by vyolence vsurpyd the name off holy church / So that if
a man had had a croune or a long goune and a white smock over his goune / tha^
was there no remedy but he must nedis be of the church / ye and holy church
her self / So yt if a barber had made a bulle a crone / and a Tailor
Iachnappis a long goune and brought an ass forth in a white rochitte / than
no man might doubt but yt there were holy church and every man must fall
down to receive clean remission a pena and a culpa / tocie^s quocie^s / for
there ca^ ye successors of peter and paul and they yt have ye dispe^sacio^ of
christ's blood / and ye meritis of holy saints / and ye suffragis of holy
church to dystribute / and ye keyberrars of heuyn and hell / who ca^ deny but
this is truth? It is to opyn to need any probacyo^ / for we see it daily a fore
our yies So yt if a man will compare our master Christ yt is ye very head of
holy church un to these pelattis (yt call the^ self his vicares) he shall find
but small agreement / by twene ye person and ye vicar: and he yt will consider. S.
peter and. S. paul / with all other holy apostillis shall think yt either they
were none of holy church or ellis our prelatris ^ for they agree in nothing /
ye and he may rekkyn yt. S. peter and. S. paul were stark foolis and right mad
men yt liuyd so despectuus a liff. what ned me to make many wordys / or to tell
their namys yt I speak of / There is no doubt but ye galde horise will bewraye
him self. But shortly / yt ye devil would come in his own person disgysyo /
Tell me how it were possible yt he could be more contrary to christ and his
holy apostillis / tha^ those me^ yt call the^ self ye holy church / ye take a
way ye name off ye church / and set in her stead ye name of ye devil and how
will you tha^ know a bishop from ye devil? By their workis? nay trewly / for
they be all one and yet will ye be ye hedys of chrystis church / ye ye holy
church here self / not so ye wyked not so. Wherefore yt this blessed spouse
of christ / may be knowyn from ye opyn and abominable whores and harlatis /
therefore will I (by godis grace) set out what holy church is and where by me^
shall know her

This word Ecclesia / both in the new testament and the old / is takyn
oftyntymys for the hole congregation and the holle multitude of ye people both
good and bad / as it is in the book of numeri / Nume. 20
why have you brought the congregation or church of god in to wilderness? also
in a another place / 3. Regu^. 8
The king turnyd his face and blessid the holle congregation or church of
Israel / ^. Corin. 4
and all the church of Israel stood. lykewysse in the new testament S.
Paul to ye Corynthia^s / I have sent un to you Tymothe the which shall learn
you my ways / that be in christ Jesus / 1. Corin. 11
as I do learn every where in all co^gregacions. Also in an other place do you
dispisse the congregation of god? and shame them yt have not? In all these
placis and in many mo is it opyn that this greek word ecclesia is takyn for
the hole congregation both of good and bad / where fore this is not the church
that we will greatly speak of / for in this church are Iuys and Sarasens /
Murtherars and theuys / baudys and harlotes though we know them not. Ephesi. 5.
But there is a another holy church of the which S. paul spekyth you men love
your wiuys / as christ has louyd the church / and has geuyn him self for
her / that he might santyfye her / And cleanse her in the fovntayne off watter
through the word of liffe / to make her to him self a glorious church with out
spot or wrynkille / or any such thing / but yt she might be holy and with out
blame. Here have you the very true church of christ / that is so puer and so
clean with out spot. But whereby is she puer and clean? not by her own meritis
nor by her own might / not by exterior array / not by gold nor silver nor yet
by precious stonys / neither by myters nor crosestaues / nor by pillars nor
polaxis / but whereby than? by Christ only which has geuyn him self for
that intent that he would make her clean and there fore says S. Paul / He
gave him self that he might santifie her / that he might cleanse her and make
her to him self a glorious church. Also in a another place: you are wasshid /
you are sanctifyde / you are iustifyde in the name of Jesus christ / and in the
sprete of god. Se my lords / how the church is washed by christ and by his
holy sprete / and not by your blessingis / 1. Corin. ^
not by your sprytualle ornamentis / nor by your spritualle holy watter / for
these things ca^ not help the holy church for she is holy in sprytte and not
in outward hypocrysye / she is also clensyd by christ's blessed blood / and not
by outward disgysyngis. This does S. Augustine well prove saying Of christ is
the church made fair / first was she fylthy in synnys / Augustinus de verbis
dn^i ser. 50
afterward by pardon and by grace was she made fair etc^ here S. Augustine
says that christ has made his church fair / and that by his grace and his
pardon / And not by your pardons / nor by your grace for this church /
stondythe by Christis eleccion / and not by youres: and if Christ have not
wasshid you and chosyn you than be you none of this church though you ride
with a thousand spretualle horses / and have all the spretual tokyns in earth
/ Joan. 6.
for and if the sone of god have dylyuerd you tha^ are you trewly deliuerd / ye
can not make by all your power and holiness that we shall al ways find good
ale or wine where there hangyth out a grene sign / And will you with your
sprituall signs and tokins make the church of god to follow you / or by them
assign out where the church shall be? nay nay my lordis / yt will not be: but
they that believe yt Christ has washed them from their sins / and styke fast
un to his meryttis and to the promysse made too them in him only / they be the
church of god / and so puer and so clean that yt shall not be lawful no not
for Peter to say that they be unclean / but where they be Iue or greek / king
or subject / Carter or cardinalle / bucher or bishop / Ta^cardeberar or
ca^n^lcater / fre or bound / friar or fydler / Monk or Miller if they believe
in Christis word / and styke fast to his blessed promysys / and trust only in
ye meryttis of his blessed blood / they be the holy church of god ye and the
very true church a fore god / and you with all your spirytuall tokyns / and
with all your exteryor cle^nes / remain in your fylthynes of sin / from
the which all your blessings / all your pardons / All your spiritualyte /
all your holiness / ca^ not cleanse you / nor bring you in to this church: Boste
/ Crake / Blaste / Bless / Curse tille your holly yies starte out of your
head yt will not help you / for Christ chousythe his church / at his judgment
and not at youres. The holy ghost is fre / and in speryth where he will / he will
neither be bound / to Pope nor Cardynall / archebysshop nor Bishop / Abbot nor
Pryor / Deken nor Archedeken / Parson nor Vyckar / too Nun nor Frear.
Breuelye come all the hol^ tabbylle of you to gether that call your self the
holy church (and exclude all other) ye and take son / moan / and stars to
help you with all the friends you have in heaven and earth and yet shall you
not be of holy church except that you have the sprite of christ and be wasshid
in his blessed blood / For the holy church of christ is nothing else but that
congregation / that is sanctified in sprete / redeemed with Christis blood / and
stykkyth fast and suer alonly to the promissis that be made theryn.

So that the church is a spiritualle thing and no exteryor thing but
invisible from carnalle yies (I say not that they be invisible that be of the
church / but that holy church in her self is invisyble) as faith is / and
her puernes and clennes is a fore christ only / and not a fore the world / for
the world has no Judgment nor knowledge of her but all her honor and
clennes is a fore Christ suer and fast / and if there is apere any of her goodness
un to ye world / of yt she makyth no reckoning / nor thynkyth her self any
thing the better / that the world Judges well of her: for all her trust is
in christ only. She suffers the world rage and blaspheme both agenst her
and agenst christ her maker. She stondith fast and beleuythe steadfastly / that
that shall have a shamfulle end / and everlasting damnacion to reward.
Breuely / her meditacions and her thoughts are heuynly and all that she does
is spiritualle. For she can not err she cleaves so fast to the word of god
that is the verite.

And for this cause Saint Paul / callyth her the pyler and ground of truth /
not that she is so suer of and in her own strength / but that she stykkyth so
fast to the living god and to his blessed word / this is the very true
church / that is scattered through all the world / and is neither bound to
parson by the reason of dignyte / nor yet to any place by the reso^ of faynyd
holiness / But she is a fre thing through all the world as S. Augustine does
witness in these words / Augusti. ser. 99. de tempore.
The holy church are we / but I do not say we as one should say / we that be
here alonly / that hear me now / but as many as be here faythefull christenyd
men in this church / that is to say in this City / As many as be in this
regyon / as many as be beyounde the sea / as mani as be in all the wholle
world (for from the rysynge of the son tylle the going dovne is the name of
god prayssed) so is the holy church our mother etc^. Here have you plainly /
that the holy church is the congregation of faithefulle men where so ever they
be in the world. And neither the pope / nor yet his cardynallys be more this
church or of this church than the poorest man in earth / for this church
stondeth alonlye in the spiritual faith of christ Jesus / and not in dignyties
nor honors of the world / as Liranus does declare in these wordis The
church does not stond in men by the reason of spritualle power / Lyram mar.
ca. 19
or secular dygnite / For many pryncis and many popes / and other inferior
persons have sweruyd from the faith / wherefore that church does stand in
those parsons in whom is the true knowledge and confession of faith / and of
veryte etc^. O my lords what will you say to lira? I have great mervelle that
you burn him not. It is hye time to condemn him for an heretyke / for he
speaks agenst your law xxiiij. q. 1. Quodcumque. where as your gloss
declarithe yt god suffers not The romechurche for to err / and lyra says
plain that many popis have erred. And also that the church stondith not in
dygnyte but in confession of christ and of his blessid verite.

But now here will be obyectyd that I feign such a church / as our logicions
do intencionem secundam that is a thing that is no where. Where shall a man
find a church that is so puer and so clean that has neither spot / nor
wrynkille in hare and that is with out all syn / seeing that all men must of
truth say / Matt. 6, 1. Joan. 1.
forgive us our trespass? And if any man say (be he never so rightwise) that he
has no syne than is he a liar / and there is no veryte in him / To this I
answer / Ephesi. 5.
that this holy church has sin in her and yet is she puer and clean /
Mark S. paulis wordis. Christ has geuyn him self for her that he might make
her glorious / So that the clennes of this holy church is the mercy of god
toward her through christ for whose sake he laithe nothing to her charge ye
and if any other parson would / he is reddy to give her his clennes / and to
let her by faith claim of right his puernes for her own. For by twene them
all is commen / as be twene man and wife. So that if the church look on her
own meritis and of her own workis / she is fulle of sin and must nedis say
dimitte mihi debita. The which she nedid not to say if she had none. But if
she refer her self un to the merittis of her blessid husbonde christ Jesus /
and to the clennes that she has in his blood / than is she with out spotte
For by the reason yt she stickith by faith so fast un to her husband christ and
does a bide in confession of her sin / and requyerith mercy for them /
therefore is there nothing laid to her charge / but all thing is forgeuyn her.

And therefore says. S. Paul / there is no damnacion unto them that be in
Christ Jesus. And that this may be the playner I will bring you. Augustinus
de verbis apostoli. s. 29.
S. Austins words / the which was vexed of the donatistes with this same reason
that is laid agenste me / his words be these. The holle church says /
forgive us our sins / wherefore she has spots and wrynkylles / but by
knowlegynge of them / her wrynkylles be exte^ded and stretched out / by
knowlegynge / her spots are washed away. The church a byddeth in prayer
that she might be cleansed by knowlegynge of her sins. As long as we live
here so stands yt / and when we shall depart out of this body / all such
things be forgeuen to everye man / wherefore by this mean the church of god /
is in ye tresurs of god / with out spot and wrynkylles: and therefore here do
we not live with out sin / but we shall pass from hence with out sin.
etc^. Here have you clearly that the church of god is cleansed and puryfide by
christ for knowlegynge of her sins / and not by her own puernes wherefore
such a church there must needs be / though yt the carnalle yie can not se h^re
/ nor fleshely reason can judge of her. wherefore we believe this article by
faith that holy church is a communion or felyshyp of holy men / and know yt
not by seeing or feeling / as we do the felishype of drapers or mercers / for
than were yt none article of the faith. And yt is plain yt all your exterior
signs / with all your holy ornaments / as your holy myters / your holy
crossestauys / your holy pyllers and polaxis / your holy red gloves / your
holy ouches / and pour holy rings / your holy anointed fyngers / your
holy vestmentis / your holly challisys / and your holy goulden showys / ye
and take also to help you. S. Thomas of Canterberys holy show with all the
holy botys of holy monkys and all these to gether can not make one crumme of
holiness in you / nor help you one prycke forward / that you may be with in
this church. For if these things could help / than were yt no mastery to
make an ass to be of the church of god. But our holy mother ye church has a
another holiness / yt comes from god the father through ye sweat blood of his
blessed son Jesus Christ / in whom is all her confidens and trust. Un to
whom she stycketh only by steadfast faith / by whose pureness she is also puer
in that yt she does confess her uncleanness / for she believes steadfastly yt
she has an advocate for her sin to the father of heaven / which is christ
Jesus. 1. Joan. 2.
And he is the satisfaccio^ for her sins. And he of his marcye and not of her
merits has chossen her for to be his / and by cause she is his / therefore
must she be clean so long as she aby^eth in him. This is well declared in.
Joan. 15
S. Johan where our Master Christ is compared to ye vine and all the members
of holy church to the branches / yt as the branches / can bring forth no
fruit of them self / so can holy church of her felfe bring forth no goodness
except she remain in christ by perfyt faith. This is well proved by your
own law whose words be these / therefore is the church holy / by cause she
believes rightwyselye in god. etc^. De co^. Di 4. c. prima igitur.
Here you not the cause wherefore the church is holy? by cause she believes
rightwyselye in god / that is she believes in nothing but in him / and she
beleuethe nor hereth nor word but his / as our Master Christ berythe wytnes
/ my sheep here my voice / and a another man's voice do they not know / also in
a another place / he that is of god / herythe the words of god / how commythe
this that the church of god has so suer a judgment / that she knowythe the
voice of Christ from other voycis? and can not err in her judgment? By cause
that Christ has chosen her / and by cause she is learned of god as our master
Christ says / and by cause she has (as. 1 Johan. 2.
S. Johan says) the inward oyntement off god / that techyth his all manner of
verite / so yt she can not err / but why can she not err? by cause she may do
what she will? By cause that all thing that she does / is well done? by
cause she may make new rules and new laws at her pleasure? By cause she may
invent a new service of god that is not in scripture at her will? Nay nay my
lords. For she is but a woman and must be ruled by her husbonde / ye she is
but a sheep and must here the voice of her sheppard / and so long as she does
/ so long can she not err by cause the voice of here shepperd can not be
false.

De pene Dis. 2. Si in glossa. 24. q. 1 A recta et in Glossa.
This may be proved by your own law whose words be these / the whole
church can not err / also in a another place / the congregation of faith fulle
men must needs be which also can not err. etc^. These words be plain what
church yt is that can not err / that is the congregation of faithfulle men
that be gethered in christ's name / which have christ's spret which have the
holy oyntement of god / which abide fast by christ's word / and here no
another man's voice but his. Now my lords gather you all to gether with all
the laws that you can make / and all the holiness / that you can deuysse / and
Cry / ye church / ye church / and the counsels / ye counsels that were
lawfully gathered in the power of the holy ghost (all this may you say and yet
lie) and if you have not in deed the holly ghost with in you / and if you do
hear any other voice than christ's / thane are you not of ye church / but of
the deuylle / and theuys and murtherars as christ says. For you come a fore
him / that is you come in to the foulde of Christ with out him / you bring
not his voice / but you come with your own voice / with your own statutis /
with your own word / and with your own mandamus / mandamus / precipimus /
precipimus / excommunicamms / excommunicamus These be the voices of murtherars
and Theuys and not of Christ / therefore you can not but err / for you be not
taught of god / you have not the holy oyntement you have not the word of god
for you / you here not ye voice of ye true shepperd / there fore must you
needs err in all your counselles. This is a another manner of rule thane my
lord of iochester does assine to examen your counselles by / for he says /
where yt the pope and the counsel does not agree all in one there will he
susspect the counselle not to be right. who did ever here such a rule of a
christenyd man? ye and of a bishop? ye and of a doctor of divinity / where
has he learned this divinity? to reckon a counselle to be true / by cause
that the pope and so many men do agree in one / ye and that such men as have
so oftyn times erred in their counsels / as he does declare him self
reckoning the counselle of Constantinople that had.330. bisshops and yet did
err / and he knew no another cause / but by cause the pope did not agree to them
/ is not this a reasonable cause? can not the pope err? let him red^ his own
law. Dis. 19. Anastasius / and Dis. 40. Si papa and also.24. q. 1. A recta in
the gloss / and there shall he find that the pope has erred wherefore than
should the matter stand in his judgment? Now how will he by this rule save
the counselles of constance / and of basel where in both counsels the popes
were condemned for heretykes? as the same counsels make mention / also that the
counsels have erred that grants he him self / but paraduenture he will say
/ that they were not fulle counsels. Now is yt well a mended / what
dysticcionis (as consernynge the veryte in a counselle that has a thousand
bisshopes and in a another that has fyve thousand can the multitude help to
the veryte? Than had the turk the veryte and we the falsed / 3. Reg. 2 3. Reg.
18.
than had the prophet Micheas the worsse part for he was a lone agenst.iiij.
hundred / so was the veryte by ye prophets of Baale / and not by Elyas / for
they were four hundred and fiftye and he was but one man. Breuely Christis
flock is all ways the smallyste number in this world / but yet yt is the best
/ not yt the smallest number makes christis flock / but that christ's church
stondeth neither by the grettest number nor yet by the smallest / nor by ye
judgment or numberynge of man / but by the calling and eleccion of god /
wherefore let my lord bring forth / what counselle that he will and if they
have not the word of god / I will not alonly say they may err / but also yt
they do err in very deed. And ye will I prove by the grettest lawyar yt they
have called Panormitanus whose words be these / De ^ectio ^. s^gnifica
yt counselle may err as it has erred / as co^sernynge ye co^tracte of
matrimony / inter raptore^ et rapta^ / The counsel of mel delci did ^rre
and the saying of. S. Hierom was afterward preferred a ^oue the statute of the
counselle as yt is proved. 36. q. 2. Tria / for in things consernynge the
faith is the saying of a pryuate person to be prefarred a fore the saying of
the pope if he have better resons and scripturs of the new and ye old
testament for him than the pope / nor yt ca^ not help to say that the
counselle can not err by cause that Christ did pray for his church yt her
faith should not faylle / for I answer to this / that though the generalle
counsel do represent the wholle vniuersalle church / nevertheless in very
deed there is not the very vniuersalle church / but representative. For the
vniuersalle church stondeth in the elect^on of all faithfulle me^ and all
faith fulle me^ of ye world make ye vniuersalle church / whose head and spouse
is christ Jesus and the pope is but the vycker of Christ and not the very head
of the church / this is ye church that can not err. etc^. Here it is open that
the counselle may err / and that a private person having scriptures for him
is to be hard a fore the pope and also the conselle having no scriptures for
them / you have also what is the very true church which can not err / which
thing ca^ not be veryfyed of your counselles for they be neither with out
error nor yet the holy church but that they do represent the church as a
legate represents a kings person but of ye follows not that he is the
king or has as much power as the king / or is a bove ye king or yt he may
rule ye king / Augustinus de bap. Ki. 2. c. 3. contra dona^as
this may also be proved by. S. Augustine whose words be these / those
cou^selles yt be gethered in every province must with out give place to ye
auctorite of the full cou^sellis which be gethered of all chrystendo^ / and
also those full cou^sellis often timis must be a mendyd by the full counsellys
that come after / if any thing be opened by any experience that was a fore
shyt / and if any thing be known that was hyddyn. And this may be done with
out any shadow of supersticious pride / with out any bostyd Arrogancye with
out any contencyon of malycius envye / but with holy meknes / with holy peasse
/ and with chrystened cheryte. etc^. Here it is plain that your full
cou^selles may be a mendyd and reformyd / the which thing need not / if they
could not err ye and if they did not err in deed. Moreover you must needs
grant that there is a rule where by your counsellys must be exa^mynyd / and
where by sentens must be geuyn which of your counsellys be true and which
false / by the which rule if your cou^sellys be not ordered / they must nedys
err and be false / and of the devil wherefore gather all your counsellys too
gether and yet of them can you not make holy church / But peradventure there
may be many in your counsellys good and perfyte men and of holy church / But
they and you to gether make not the universal holy church that can not err /
Neither have you any auctoryte over holy church / further than the holy
scripture off god / But as soon as you for sake Christ and his holy word / so
sone are you the congregacyo^ of the devil / and theuys and murtherars / and
yet for all this there must nedis be an holy church of christ in earth that is
neither bound to Jerusalem nor to Cou^sta^tinopill / nor yet to Rome as though
she were like un to / the Ass and ye foolle.

But now will there be objected / that our Master Christ commands / Man. 1^
yff my brother offend me that I should complain to ye church / Now is this
church that I have set out spretualle and no man knows her but God only /
she is also scattered through out the world / wherefore how can a man complain
to that church? I answer our master Christ does plainly speak of a man that
has wrong / the which must needs be a particular and a serten man / and
therefore like wysse he byddythe him complain not to the vniuersalle church /
but to the particular church. Now this particular church / if she be of god /
and a true member of the vniuersalle church / she will judge ryghtwysly after
Christ's words / and after the probacions brought a fore her / never the less
oftyn times comyth yt that this particular church does fully and holly err and
judges unright and excommunycateth him / that is blessed of god / 24. q. 3. Si
quis et. c. cu^ aliquis
as yt is open in your own law / whose words be these / oftyn times he that
is cast out is with in / and he that is with out is kept with in. etc^. Here
have you plainly that the particular church may err / wherefore that church
that can not err is all only the vniuersalle church which is called the
communion and the felowshyppe of saynctis / the which addicion was made by
holy fathers (for in Ciprians time was there no mention of yt) by all lyklyhod
to declare the presumpcion of serten men / and of serten congregacions yt
rekened them self to be holy church. wherefore my lords se well to lest the
holy ghost have prykkyd you with this addicion / for you have all ways made
your self holy church / ye and that with out any holiness. Now have I
declared un to you / what is holy church / that is the congregation of
faithfulle men through out all the world: and where by she is holy / that is
/ by Christ's holiness and by christ's blood / and also what is the cause that
she can not err / by cause that she keeps her self so fast to the word of
god / which is a parfyt and a true rule. ^ow a man may know the church.
Now must we declare by what signs and tokens that we may know that in this
place or in that place there be serten members of this holy church / for though
she be in her self sprytualle and cannot be perfytly known / by our exterior
senses / yet never the less we may have serten tokens / of her spritualle
presens / where by we may reken that in this place and in that place be sertyne
of her members. As by a naturalle example / though the soul of man in her
self be spritualle and invisible yet may we have suer tokens of her presence /
as herynge movynge / speaking / smelling / with such other. So lykewysse /
where the word of god is trewly and perfytly preached with out the damnable
dreams of men / and where yt is well of ye herars reseued / and also where we
se good works that do openly agree with the doctrine off the gospel these be
good and suer tokens where by that we may judge / that there be some me^ of
holy church.

As to the first / where as the gospelle is trewly preched yt must needs light
in some men's hartis / as the prophet wyttnesseth / my word / shall not
return a gain to me frustrate / but yt shall do all thing that I will /
and yt shall prospere / Esaie. 55.
in those things / un to the which I did send yt.

Also. S. Paul says faith comes by heryng / and herynge comes by the
word of god / Romans x.
and therefore yt is open in holy scripture that when Peter spoke the words of
god ye holy ghost fell dovne on them all. Actu. 10.
wherefore yt is open that gods word can never be preched in vain / but some
men must needs reseue yt / and there by be made of holy church / though that
men do not know them neither by their names nor yet by their faces / for this
word is reseued in to their hearts. The second token is / that the reseuers
of this word do work well there after as. 1. Tessa. 2.
s. Paul declares of his herars when you reseued of us the word where with
god was preched / you reseued yt not as the word of men / but even (as yt was
in deed /) the word of god which works in you that believe. So that if men
do work after the word of god yt is a good token that there be men off the
church / though that we (hypocrisye is so subtylle and so secret) may be often
times dysseued by these vtward works / but nevertheless cherite judges well
of all things yt have a good outward shine / and be not openly agenst the
word of god / but it is no ieoperdye though cherite be dysseued / for he is
open to all ieoperdyes but faith is never disseued. Now to our purposse / yt
where the word of god is preched trewly / yt is a good and a perfyt token yt
there be some me^ of christ's church / this may be proved by chrisostimus
words / they yt be in Judea let the^ fle up in to ye mountayns / yt is to say
they yt be in chrystendu^ / let the^ give the^ self to scripturs. wherefore
commands he yt all chrystened men in that time should fly un to scriptures
/ for in that time in the which hereses have opteyned in to the church / there
ca^ be no true probacion of christendom nor no another refuge un to christen men
willing to know the verite off faith / but the scripturs of god. A fore by
many ways was yt showed which was the church of Christ / and which was the
congregation of gentilles / but now there is no notherway to know unto them
that will know which is the very true church of Christ / but alonly by
scripturs. By works first was ye church of christ known when the conversation
of christen men / other of all or of many were holy / the which holiness had
not the wykked men / but now christen me^ / be as evylle or worsse tha^
heretics or gentles ye and greater continency is found among them / than a
monge christen men. wherefore he that will know which is the very church of
christ / how shall he know but by scripturs only / wherefore our lord
consideringe that so grett confusion of things should come in the latter days
/ therefore commands he that christen me^ which be in christendom willing to
reserve the stedfastenes of true faith should fly un to no another thing but
un to scripturs for if they have respect un to other things they shall be
sclandered and shall perish / not understanding which is the true church.
etc^.

These words need no exposicion they be plain I nough they do also exclude
all manner of learning saving holy scripture / wherefore se how you can with
honesty save your holy laws / and defend them against Chrisostom. Moreover
if chrisostom complain of the incontenency that was in his days / how would
he compain if he now lived and saw the baudry and fornicacion / that is in
the church? Also he sendith men to scripturs that will know the holy church /
and not unto the holy church for in the church were heresys / but not in
scripture.

Also. Ephe. 2.
S. Paul wyttnesyth the same sayng / you are bylte a pon the foundacio^ of the
apostylles and prophets / here have you plainly that the very true church is
grounded ye and foundyd of holy scripture / and therefore where so ever that the
word of god is preched / that is a good token that there be some men of
christ's church. But now as to the fruits and works of this church / she does
alonly fetch out her manner of living / and all her good works out of the
holy word of god / and she faynyth not nor dremythe any other new holiness or
new invented works that be not in scripture but she is content with christ's
learning and believes / that christ has sufficienly taught her all manner of
good works that be to ye honor of our heuynly father. Therefore inuenteth
she no another way to heaven but follows christ only / in sufferynge
oppressions and persecucions / blasphemynges and all other things that may be
laid unto her / which as. S / Augustine says she learned of our Master
Christ. Augustinus
Our holy mother the church through out all the world scattered for and long
/ in her true head Christ Jesus taught / has learned not to fere the contumelys
of the cross nor yet of death but more and more is she strengthed not in
resystinge but in sufferynge. etc^.

Now my lords compare your self to this rule of. S. Augustine / and let us
se how you ca^ bring your self in to the church? or else to prove your
self to be holy? The church sufferth persecucions (for as. S. Paul says /
they that will live devoutly in christ must suffer persecusion) and you
withstond all things and suffer nothing / ^ Timo. 3.
you oppres every man and you will be oppressed of no man / you persecute
everye man and no man may speak aworde agenst you / no though yt be never so
true / you cast everye man in preson / and no man may touch you but he shall
be cursed / you compelle every man to say as you say / and you will not once
say as Christ says / and as for your holiness all the world knows what it
is / for yt stondeth in clothyng and in dekkynge / in watchynge and slepynge /
in etynge and in drinking this meat or that meat / this drink or that
drink / in patterynge and numblynge these Psalmys or that Psalmys with out
devotion. Breuely all your holiness is in books / belles / candelles /
challeses / oil cream watter / horses / hounds pallycis / and all that is
mighty and glorious in the world there on hang you / there in glory you /
there on crake you / there on boste you / there upon bylde you. Is this the
natures of the church? is this holiness? of whom have you learned these manners?
you can not deny but these be truth / and if you would deny yt / all the
world is wyttnes agenst you / ye and also your own factes and deeds / of
whom have you learned this holiness? Hilarious. cont. Arianos
not of christ nor yet of his holy church / but you have learned yt of the
Arians / that were the servants of ye deuylle / as Hylarius writes in these
words / ye church does threten / with banyshementes and presonmentes / and
she compels men to believe her / which was exiled and cast in preson / no
whangeth she / on the dignite of her fellyshyp the which was consecrated / by
the thretnynges of persecuters / she causes prestes to fly that was in
cressed by the chassynge away of prestes / she gloryeth that she is loved of
the world / the which could never be christ's except the world did hatte her.
etc^.

How think you my lords? do not you all these things? that be laid to the
Arians charge? your own friends / ye your own co^sciens must needs accuse
you of all these things / and yet will you be called christ's childern I lay
nothing to you / but ye holy doctors lay un to you.

But let us se what. Barnardus super can. s. 33
S. Barnarde says on you / they call them selue the mynysters of christ but
they serve Antichriste / they goo gorgiously a rayed of our lords goods / un
to whom they give none honor / and of these goods co^mythe / the harlottes
deckyng that thou seyst daily / the game players dysgysynge / and kings
aparrelle / of this comes goulde in their brydylles / in their sadylles / and
in their spurs so that their spurs be bryghtter than the aultres: of this
comes their plentuous wine pressys and their fulle sellers / bolkynge from
this unto that / of this comes their tonnes of sweet wynys / of this be their
baggys so fyllyd / for such things as these be / will they be rulers of the
church / as dekyns / arche dekyns / bishops / and arche bishops. etc^.

My lords I had thought / to have added cardinals and legates abbottes and
pryors / to have made the company more holly / but I durst not. How think you
/ of whom does he speak whane he says bisshops and archebisshops? what
holiness does he repreue / whane he speaks of gorgius array / of harlottes
dekkynge / of game players dysgysyng / of goulden spurs / saddylles and
brydylles? if there were an.C. that did use yt more than you yet must you needs
grant yt he spekyth of you / he passyth me sore / in condemminge of your holy
ornaments / for he calls you the servants off Antichrist / and your holy
ornaments harlottes deckynge and game players dysgysynge / and he says that
you are neither the church nor ol the church / but the servants of
Antichrist / how think you by. S. Barnarde yt is time to condemn him / for he
speaks agenst holy church and all her holy ornaments / this dare I well say
/ that if the best christen man with in the royalme should preach these
words of. S. Barnarde you would not stycke to condemn him for an heretyke /
but you were wont to call him swett Bernarde / but my thinks yt he is sour
I nough in this thing / wherefore dispute the matter with him yt you may come
in to the church / and not with me.

Finis.
What the keys of the church are and to whom they be geuyn.
TO declare this matter our scole men have wrapped them self in such doutes
that they were never abylle to come out of them / nor yet to satisfye them
seluys nor no good Christenmans conscience: for all that they write is but
dremys off their own invencion / and as paul callythe them the doctryns of
the deuille agenst the holy word of god / 1 Timo. 4
and wringynge and wrestyng ye blessed word of god to there purposse / alonly
consyderinge how they might / by right or by wrong stablishe the auctorite of
miserable men / not consyderinge the intent of the holy ghost which intendyd
nothing else in all places of scriptur / but to opyn un to us christ / and the
losing from our sin by him only The which thing our dremers / and
inventers of all subtille lies did never perseue / nor never sought for / but
by dispysynge the holy word of god / and stykkyng so fast to their own
corruptyd resons / did they faulle in to innumerable heresies dyssencions and
contencions / and brawlinges of wordis / and scolding like harlo^tes / so that
none of them could agree with a another. where fore that saying of the holy
prophet may well be veryfyed of them.

Psalm. 80.
My people have not hard my voice and Israel has takyn no head un to me / and
there fore have I let them pass after the desyeres of their own hertes / and
therefore they shall follow their own inve^cio^s / this is always ye sore
ve^gea^ce of God / whane we will not believe and reseue alonly his word / than
does he let us pass / so yt we cane do nothing but err. Not with sto^dinge
we are so blyndyd that we think darknys light / and erroures verytye

This is opynly prouyd / by all our grett Clarkely scolemen / and that yt may
be opyn to all men / I will recyte what they learn of ye keys Duns and all
his scolars say that these keys be nothing else / Scotus. 4. sent. di. 18
but an auctorite geuyn to pristes where by they give sentence / that heuyn
must be openid to this man and schyt unto the other: so that heuyn is opened
and shyt at the sentence of the pryst / This is his lerninge* who could have
invented such a doctrine / but the deuille him self? who ca^e speak agretter
heresy than this is? who cane speak more opynly agenst christ and his holy
scripture? If the auctorite of the pryst be the keys of heuyn / and cane opyn
and shytte heuyn / than need w^ no another thing to our salvation / but the
auctoryte of the pryst / than can no man be sauyd with out the auctorite of the
pryst / than cane there no prystes be damned / For they have the keys of heuyn
/ I think they will not be so mad: as by their auctorite to shytt them self
with the deuylle. Breuely what need have we of Christ and of his holy word /
For the auctorite of the pryst is the keye of heuyn / but let me bring their
own words that the matter may be playner Nicho. de orbel. d^. vtsupra.


The keye in this purposse is takyn after ye symilitude of a material keye
which is ye next instrument to shyt and to opyn a door by where by we enter in
to the house So likewise / the auctorite to give sentence that heuyn mvst be
opened un to this man / is called the keye. etc^ / To use many wordis in
refellynge this damnable opinion yt needs not / But against them all / I will
set the auctorite of Saint Hierom whose wordis be these / I shall give the the
keys of heaven This place / Hiero in M. c. ^6.
the Bishops and the prystis not understanding have vsurpyd un to them some
what of the pharisys pride / so that they think yt they may condemn
innocentis / and loosse them that be gylty / when a fore god not the sentence
of the pryst but the lyffe of the giltye is regardyd. etc^. Here you have
plainly yt ye sente^s of the prist is not lokyd on / nor abyll to loose a
sinner a fore god / Mark also that Saint Hiero^ says you understood not this
place. Moreover I would know of you all / where you can bring me one exampyll
in scripture / that the sentence of a prist has losyd a sinner / or bound a
ryghtwise man / and if it can not do this / than is there a another thing a
boue the sentence of a prist Furthermore yt your auctorite should be ye keys
of heuyn / it is agenst reason and agenst your own lernyng / for duns and
also lyra of this same text / Scotus. 4. sen did. 15 Quest. 1.
Quodcu^que ligaueris / do plainly declare / yt your key of auctoryte may err
/ Now if it may err / than is yt not the right key to the lock of heaven / for
the right key can never err in his own lock / wherefore at the most you can
make it but a pickelocke which belongs to robbers and theuys only. Mo^eouer
if this were the key / than should we never be in suerte whether heaven were
opened or not. First we have no promysse nor no word of god / made unto this
key / And again we can not know wha^ it opens heaven and when not / for it
may err after your own doctors and if it chance for to err than are not
heaven gatys opened / So yt be this meanys we shall be all ways in doubt /
whether we by lossyd from our sin or not. Vvherfor we must seek out a another
key that is the very true key to the lock the which cannot err / of the
which we shall be in suerte and with out all doubt / But ere we declare what
this key is / we will first show the nature and the propertye of this key.

Saint Augustine says That must be called a key where by the hardness of our
hartis are opened un to faith / Aug. ser: 2. de sane.
and where by the secrettnes of minds are made manifest / A key yt is (says
he) the which does both opyn the consyens to the knowledge of sin / and also
includyth grace / un to the holsomnes of the everlasting mystery. etc^. This
is the diffynicion of this keye that we speak of after / Saint Augustyne / Now
compare your power un to this diffinicyon / and see how they do agree. First
what ca^ your power do (which you call your key) to remove a way the hardness
of the heart / and to bring in faith? Again what can your key Judge of the
secretnes of man's mind? Thirdly what can your power do to man's conscie^s to
make him to knowledge his sin? ye where by do you know your own sin? by
your power? tha^ have all pristis a like knowledge. Fynallye what grace does
your power include in him? yt may bring us to everlasting Joy? where fore
you see yt this diffinicion agreethe as well with your keye / as Chalk and
Chese.

There fore must we seek a another keye / yt has all these propertyes. This is
nothing else / but the holy word of god / whereby that we reseue faith in to
our hartis as. S. paul says / Romans ^0.
Faith is by heringe and herynge is by ye words of god / and for this cause ye
holy prophet callyth it a lantern saying. Psalm. 118.
Thy word is a lantern un to my fette / and yt is light un to my pathys. Ibidem
By this word do we reseue lyffe as ye prophet says / Thy speech shall
quickyn me Also the secrettys of our hartys be opened by this word as. Saint
paul declarith saying if there come one that does not believe / he is repreuyd
by the word off all men and the secretis of his heart are opened / ^. Cor. ^4.
By this word also is declared un to us grace and everlasting lyffe as. ^.
Thy. ^.
S. paul says / christ has put a way death / and has brought lyffe and
immortalite un to light through the gospel / This is you thing only where by yt
our co^sciens is loosed and mad fre from sin. Therefore says the holy
prophet there is much peasse un to them that love the law of god / Psalm. 118.
and there is no sclaunder unto them / much peasse is nothing ellis but
remission of sins / ye and yt with out any doubt / for he yt is loosed by ye
word of god / that is / he that has ye open word of god for him yt his sins
be for given him he ca^ not be sclanderyd / yt is / there is nothing can make
him to doubt / but though heaven and hell lyffe and death do thretyn him / he is
not offendid he is not sclanderyd / but bydeth fast and knowythe suerly that
all these thyngys must peryshe / but the word of god bideth for ever /
Wherefore this is the very keye that Judges the thoughtis and ye intentis of
ye heart / as. S. paul says: Hebre. 4.
By this have we also ye very knowledge of our sin / as. S. paul declarythe
to ye Romans / Roma. 3.
by this is also declared unto us grace / and also remyssyon of our sins if
we believe yt. Wherefore this must nedis be the very true keye as you may see
euydently through out all scripture and not your bostyd and crakyd power / for
there is no such thing nor yet can be in man / that can loose the soul of
man from his sin. Wherefore / it is damnable and deuelysh learning and
comes of the presumtuus pride of man to learn that man has a power in him /
by the which power man's soul is bound or loosyd from sin / But this is all
that man has / he is a minister / and a dyspensator of the heavenly word of
god / for whose sake ou^e sins be remyttyd when we believe yt / and our
sins be retained when we do dyspy^e yt / Therefore the blessed word of god is
the very keye and in that is all the might and power to loss our sins / and
man is but a mynyster and a servant un to this word this may be proved / by
our Master Christ's wordys where he says. Goo your way in to all the world
/ and preche the gospel un to all creatours / Matt vi.
he that does believe and is baptysyd shall be sauyd / but he that does not
believe shall be da^nyd Here may you plainly see / That the apostyllys he but
minysters and seruauntis and have no power but alo^ly ministracyo^ The keys yt
they have where by they must lose me^ and bind is ye very word of god and
therefore says our. M. christ he ye believes shall be saved / and he yt does
not believe shall be da^nid By this word did ye holy apostles declare grace
through christ / and lernyd me^ to set all their hope of salvation in christ
only / by this word did they learn me^ to knowledge their sin / and to seek
for grace and full and whole to hope remission and forgeuenes of their sins by
christ only. Breuely by these keys / is opened all goodness if they be reseuyd
/ And all goodness is shett from us yff we reseue them not Now where this keye
is resevyd by faith there is all thyngis lossyd / yt is / all sins be
forgeuyn / and the conscyens is made fre. And where it commythe not in nor is
not reseuyd by faith / there all thyngis be shit and bound. Actu. 2
Of this manner did the holy apostlis bind and loosse whane they preched this
holy word of god un to the people / As we have an opyn example of. S. Petter /
that preached this holy word / and at his prechyng ye herars were prykkyd in
their hartis / and asked petter what they might do and he answerid them repent
and be baptisyd everye one of you in ye name of Jesus for remyssyon of your
sins and you shall reseue the gift of the holy ghost / where fore as meny as
reseuyd his word were baptisyd. Here have you plainly / ye very true manner of
lossing from sins / as the holy apostles used yt / that is whane the people
believed the word yt they preched / tha^ they declared how their sins were
remittyd for christ's sake and not through any pore that they had / for they
were but ministers. But the very power was in the word of god where by they
were delyueryd from their sins This is well provid by our master christ's
word where he says un to them / goo and preche saying / Matt. 10.
That the kingdom of heuyn is at hond / what is this the kingdom of heuyn? not
any power that is in man / But remission of sins shall be geuyn to them yt
reseue you re word / and not that reseue either your power or your parsons
and therefore follows yt. In what housse you enter / say first peace be with
you / and if the house be worthy / your peace shall come a pone the same /
that is to say if they reseue your word and believe it / thane shall your
peace / that is the peace of the gospelle which you bring with you / shall
give the^ quietness of consyens and loosse them from all sin. But if the
house be not worthy / your peace shall return to you again and who so ever
shall not reseue you nor will here your preaching when you depart out of
that house shake of the duste from your fette / I say un to you it shall be
easyer for Sodom and Gomorra in the day of Judgment than for that City / what
is this your piece shall return a gain? no thing else but that they shall
not be pertakers there of but shall remain bound in their sin / And why? by
cause they reseue not your persons or your power nay trewly / but by cause
they here not your prechyng / It is not to be douted / but that many men / by
heryng the apostles prechynge the word of god / were losyd from their syns and
yet never spoke with the apostlis. Where fore the reseuynge of the word / and
not of you apostille lossithe us from our sins / and for yt cause ye
apostille did declare by their departing from them yt would not believe the
word / that they remained stille in their sins / For as S. Mark says /
your depertynge shall be a testimony agenste them / that is to say a tokyn
of their condemnacio^. Mar. 6.
we have also an opyn practys of S. Paul how he did bind them that did not
reseue his prechynge to whom he says these wordis / Acto. 18.
your blood a pone your hedis I will depart from hens in clennes unto the
gentilles.

Now have you plainly how the holy apostille did bind and loss / and with
what keye they did it that is by prechynge of the holy word of god / And by
cause this thing should be done with out any error and that no man should
doubt in yt / Iona^ 20.
he gave them the holy ghost saying these word / whose sins you do for give
shall be for geuyn and whose sins you do retain shall be retained To these
words addyth S. Luke Thane opened he their wit yt they might o^dersto^de ye
scripturs / so yt where S. Joan says / Luc. 24.
he gave them the holy ghost Luke says / he opened there wit to understand
scripture / yt follows in Luke Thus and Thus is it writtyn that Christ must
suffer death and rise a gayn the third day and that repentance / Luc. 24.
and remission of sins should be preached in his name a mong all nacyons.
Now where S. Joan says / whosse sins you do loss shall be lossid etc^.
That says Luke in these words remission of sins must be preched in his name
So yt whosse sins you do loss shall be losed is nothing else but that you
mvst preche remyssion of sins in my name / and as meny as reseue this word
you shall loss them by this word and as meny as do not reseue it you shall
bind them by that same word / That this is the sentence of these.ij. places it
is opyn by that that they speak all of one story and of that thing that was
done all in one day / Acto. 17.
this does also S. paul prove well where he resiteth ye words of luke saying /
Christ must needs suffer and rise a gain from death / and this Jesus is christ
/ here is it plain yt S. Paul losyd me^ from their sins by prechynge
remession through christ so that you have opynly here the practis of the holy
apostyls how the did bynd and loss by prechynge the word of good. They did
bind with the word whane it was not believed. They did loss by the word
whane it was believed Thus did they by one word preche both salvation and
damnacion but un to diverse me^ / This virtue of the word does S. paul
declare in these words / 2. Corin. ^
we are un to god the sweet sauoure of christ both a monge them that are sauyd
/ and also among them which peryshe / To the one part are we ye sauoure of
death un to death / un to the other part are we the sauoure of liffe un to
liffe. What is this sauoure nothing else but ye gospel / which is un to one
sauoure of lyffe that is nothing else but lossinge and remyssio^ of sins And
un to the other it is the sauoure of death un to death / that is occasion of
byndynge and retenyng in sin / This does paul also declare in a another
place / 1. Corin. ^
The prechynge of the cross is to them that perish folishenes. but un to us
which are sauyd it is the power of god / what is ye power of god? nothing else
but remyssion and losing from our sins What is folyshenes nothing else but
they dispyse the gospel and rekyn it of no value and of no power / where fore
they remain bound in their sin. Thus is it declared that one word of god
works in diverse men diverse operacions / in ye one yt workith lyffe that is
remission of sins / in the other workythe it death and is takyn for folyshnes
/ that is it declarythe them bound and retaynyd in their damnable sins and
yet in him self / he is of one goodness and of one nature / but ye diversity
co^mythe / of the^ that be ye reseuers. This may be prouyd by a natural
example / the dew of heuyn commith down indyfferently a pone all gru^de /
but in ye one it bryngyth forth good corn and swear fruits And in ye other it
bryngith forth nettilles and bro^billes / that be nothing worth but to the fire
/ Heb. 6.
This example have you in the pystille to the hebrews for this same purposse /
likewise by one word do the holy apost^lle and christ's mynysters loss and
bind / but this do they not by charmeynge covngerynge Iuglynge and whyslinge
absolucions as you do / But by prechynge the holy word of God which whane it
is believed does quiet and loss ovre consiens from all sin / and offers
it us through christ only / But wha^ it is not believed tha^ does yt bind us and
retain us in sin So that this holy word is the very true keye of heuyn /
for by yt heuyn is opened and shett.

Chriso. in M. c. 15. De doctr. christi. li. 1 c. 15. et. 18.
This does Chrisostom well prove in these words / The key is the word and
the knowledge of scripturs / where by the gatte of veryte is opened un to men
etc^. S. Augustine does also witness the same saying. These keys has he
geuyn to the church / that what she byndeth in earth shall be bound in heuyn
/ and what she losythe in earth shall be loused in heuyn / That is so say /
who so ever does not believe that his sins be forgeuyn him in the church /
they be not forgeuyn him: But he that does believe / and averte him self from
his sins being with in ye church by that same faith and amendment is he
made holle etc^. Here have you opynly that by beleuinge the word of god our
sins be losyd / and by unbelieve be we bound in our sins / but now must we
search to who^ these keys be geuyn They may not allonly begeuen to Peter / for
than Paul / and the two sons of thu^der had the^ not Nor they may not be
given / Augustine in Joan Trac. 124*
to one more than to ye other for Christ wasse indifferent and they were al his
apostillis and their confession was all one / wherefore no dout but these keys
were given un to al Christ's apostyllis un to the wholl church / as Saint
Augustyn does decare openly upon Johan. 24. q. 1. Q^odcu^que
This may be also proved by the wordis of your own law which be these / if
peter have power alonly to bynd and to loss than does it not the church / but
if this be down in ye church / than did petter when he reseued the keys /
signify holy church / etc^. Here have you openly yt peter had not alonly the
keys / but he reseued them in the name of the church wherefore they be long
to all christen me^ / This does Origene well prove in these wordis. Tu es
petrus. etc^. Origenes Super. M. Ho. 1.
These words were spoken un to peter / un to all apostles un to all manner of
perfyte faithful me^ for all they are petrus / and in all the^ is byldyd the
church of christ / and against none of them ca^ the gatis of h^ll preuayll
Doste thou rekkyn yt the keys of heuyn were allonly given to peter / and that
no another christian man did reseue the^? etc^. Here is it clearly yt all
christen men be peter and all they have reseued the keys of heaven / and hell
can not preuayll against the^. S. August. does also testify the same in these
wordis / wherefore the church / which is fou^did and groundid in christ / Super
Io^ Trac. 1^* c. 21.
of him has reseuyd in peter ye keys of heaven / yt is / to say power to bynd
and loss. etc^. Thus is it plain yt these keys are given to the wholl
church of christ for her faith / and they be the common tresure of ye church
and belong no more to one man tha^ to another / but because yt al me^ ca^ not
use these keys all to gether / for that would make a confusion / there fore
does the church that is ye congregation of faythefulle men commytte the
ministracion of these keys / that is of the prechyng the word of god / un to
sertyn men whom they think most abylle and best lernyd in the word of god
the which men thus chossen be but ministers of the commen treasure / and no
lordis over it / for the church may deposse them / that is she may take a way
the opyn and the commen mynystracyon yt she committed un to them / if they use
it not well / and than they be but as other christen men having no commen
office nor mynystracyon in the church / where fore they may neither preche /
nor yet mynyster sacramentis opynly but as other christen men may do pryuatly /
in their own housys / or in other places where men be getheryd which will
here of christ / there I say both they and all other christen men / may speak
and learn christ's word / and declare it after the gift that is geuyn un to
them of god / and they that do believe this word thus preached by christen men /
be by the power of the keys losyd from their fynne and bound if they believe
not. For all the church and everye part of the church have power to execute
these keys / allonly that the opyn order be not brokyn / 1. Cori. 14.
This does S. paul declare saying / you may all interpretate scripturs but
se that all thyngis be done after an order / Now to keep an order and that
nothing should be done after a confuse manner / therefore the church assigns
sertyn me^ to be the opyn and the comme^ mynysters of this tresure the which
be but allonly mynysters / and no lords / And of this common tresure and not
of their priuatte tresure as S. paul says / let a man so rekkyn us as the
mynysters of christ / 1. Co. 4 Item. 3.
and dispensators of the mynistery of god / Also in a another place / what is
paul? what it appollo? but mynysters by whom you have believed / Also S. Peter
your predicessor commandethe you / 1. Pet. 5.
yt you should not exercysse any dominion over ye co^gregacio^ / but give
example to ye flock Be not these plain scripturs how you be no lords but
mynysters of Christ's tresure / and you leave ye ministracio^ and usurp
auctorite. S. Peter whose successors you boste your selves to be / commands
you yt you should use no dominion over ye co^gregacio^ / why do you not succeed
him in this thing? you should be alonly but ministers and keyeberers of these
keys / In. M. c. 23.
as Chrisostom proves in these words / ye keyeberrars are prestes unto whom
is committed ye word to teach and to interpretate scripturs. etc^. Here you
not how you be but keyeberrars and teachers of ye word of god. This does. S.
Ambrose wytnes in these words / sins be forgiven by the word of god whose
interpretar is the deken. etc^. li. de Cain et abell
Mark that sins be forgiven by ye word of god of yt which you be but
interpretars. where is nov I pray you your lordly power? which you call ye
keys of heaven / is not scripture and ye practys of ye appostles and the
exposicio^ of holy doctors openly against you? will you usurp a thing / yt
is contrary to all these? I pray you where find you in all holy scriptur / but
one yt Peter or Paul did asoyle / after ye manner of your keys. And yet no
doubt but they had ye keys / ye and also did use them wherefore it is to me
greet mervell / of whom you have learned your usage / and where you have
gotten such keys. It makes no matter to me though you cry as you are wont.
Fathers Fathers / Counsels / Counsels / the church / the church / For yt will
not help you / you see opinly / that I have the holy word of god / and our
Master Christ / which is elder tha^ our fathers I have also the practis of ye
holy apostillis that understand this thing better than all your cou^sellis /
But let us grant yt you have fathers and counsellys for you / That is the
next way to dysseue the church of god / By whom can Christen men be disseued
/ but by such men as be of auctoryte / and dignite of the world? This you know
that men can not bedesseued by horses / nor by caluys / but yt must be by men
and not by folyshe men (For who will regard fools) but by them that
berekkened of wisdom and of reputacyon in the world / And not by one wise man
(for a another wysse man may be of as good reputacyon and wysdom as he) but yt
must be by many / or ellis it can have no shine nor color of excelency / ye
and by such a multitude yt reason can not suspect / so yt there is never so
great danger un to ye church of god / as whane all these thyngis come to gether
/ and therefore says ye holy prophet / (...)
Blyssed is ye man yt follows not ye cou^sellys of wylkyd me^ / you know yt
cou^selles ca^ be no small thing / nor no folishe thing Nor the wykked men them
self do rekkyn yt for no small thing but for the gretiste thing / and the
wysyst thing / and the strongist that they can think or deuisse / and no
doubt but it has a fore reason and a fore all the world a grett apparens of no
small wysdom / and is so strong yt every man is compelled to reseue it / ye
and also those me^ have auctorite / for as ye prophet says they syte in ye
cheyre / the which does both sygnifie great learning and also great auctoryte /
And yet says ye prophet that blissed is he that follows not their
cou^sellis nor sits in their chair? Now if these thingis could be judged
by come^ reason or ellis they seemed so evil / that all ye world could judge
the^ what need the holy ghost to make so much a do or to write so stronglye
agenst them? ye and to say that blessid is he that herys them not / where fore
he must nedys speak of such myschyffe and of such falsehod / and of such
errors as have all those thingis for them that you bring of you / That is
fatherhod / wysdo^ / learning / Auctorite / Multitude / and long custom / The
which thingis be able to peruerte any man be he never so wysse or never so holy
if he styck not fast to ye word of god only / and therefore says ye prophet
blessed is he whose will and meditacion is night and day (yt is continually) in
the law of god / Un to the which if all your cou^cellis / All your fathers /
All your custo^s / breuely all yt you bring for you be compared / tha^ shall
we se whether it be true and of god or not / for of the^ self they have no
truth / but be inue^cio^s of corruptid reason) and persuasio^s of the deuell to
peruerte the holy church of god.

But my lordis let us go to reason / Tell me by your honor is it reasonable
yt the holy church of god / redeemed with christ's precious blood / and asolyd
by him from all her sins should be now bound un to you and to your
absolucyon? and yt she should not be relesyd / but through your power? seeing yt
you be but ministers and seruau^tis ordained of Christ un to her profit and
not to your honor? This will I declare by an example.

I put this casse yt there be a presoner bound fast in chenys over the which
you have the custody and the keeping after the kyngys commandment / now the
kyngys grace says un to you loss me that fellow / and let him go fre out of
preson under this co^dicio^ yt he shall promise to serve no prince but me only
/ what will you louse him or not / Can you or dare you keep him longer if you
would / Or can you compel him to make any other co^posycion with you / tha^
alonly to serve ye king / if you would keep him longer in prison did you not
ru^ne in the kyngys displesure / and if he did promise you any other
co^posicion / were he bound there to? Nay doutles. Moreover in losinge of him /
what thing do you by your auctoryte / ye what thing do you at all but that
you are mynysters un to the kyngis commandment and a servant to the pour
fellow. The ministracion and service is yowars / But the auctorite is the
kyngis of the which you have never a crumme.

Take an other example / if it would please the kingis grace to make any of you
an embassatoure and give you a commission and co^mandyme^t / to fetch whom in
to his land a banysshed man un to whom the kings grace writteth his pardon
with such wordis and under such co^dicyon as yt plesythe his grace / Now this
pardon delyuereth he to you / for to bear and to declare un to the banisshed
man / Here would I know of you / what you can do for this banysshed man more
than is written in your co^missio^ / Also what can you do agenst him in these
things that ye kings grace has perdonyd him / you can neither add nor take
a way from the kyngys pardon / you can no more do but declare yt un to ye
party / And if he reseue it than may he as law fully / and as freely come in to
the land as you may / and you can not say / by right that you have by your
auctoryte dyscargyd him or given him any pardon of his banyshement / but alonly
you have delivered and declared un to him / the kyngys pardon which when he had
reseued with the condysyons there in / than is he dyscharged of his
banysshement / And if he will not reseue the kyngys pardon / Than can you
neither help him / in to the land / nor yet discharge him of his
transegressyon / but alonly you leave him / and declare un to him / ye and that
by the kyngys words that he is a banyshed man and so shall remain till he
reseue the kyngys pardon / So like wysse the word of god where in is pardon
for all sinners is commyttyd un to you to preche and to declare / which yff
they reseue by faith they are fre and lousyd from their sins / but if they
do not they are bound not by your auctoryte / for you be but mynysters and
seruantys / and can no forther goo than your co^myssyon / but by the auctoryte
of god only / wherefore se well to your conscyens how you can dyscharge your
self a fore god that do so presumtuously usurp his auctorite / of ye which
you have neither word nor exampylle in scripture. Moreover how can you prove
this manner of absolucion. Ego ab soluo te auctoritate mihi conmissa / for to be
lawful / I pray you where was there ever any auctorite co^myttyd un to man to
take away sin? There is no auctorite co^mittid unto man / but alonly
ministracio^ of ye word / Now your absolucio^ / makes me^cio^ off auctorite ye
and yt with out ye word / and agret meny of you understood not the word. Duns
says / quod absolucio sacerdotis / e^ disposicio necessita^s ad remissione^
culpe / how think you be these fete words for a christian man if your
absolucio^ be necessari than can not god take a way sin with out you / nor
you with out him / but god and you to gether take away sin / whother will you
now? will you assend so hye / will you be cheke mattes with god? I think
shortly you will also be gods / the phareses did rekken much better of god
than you do / for they said / that god only did absolve from sins / and you
say I do assoylle / ye and that by auctoryte / so that you far pass the
phareses / but let us se what S. Augustine says of such men / meny sins be
forgeuen the / he prophysed of men that be to come. Luc. 7. Augus. li.
Quinquaginta homeliarum. ho. 23.
There were men to com that would say / I forgive sins I iustifye / I
sanctifye / I make holle so many as I baptyse wherefore the Iuys did better
understand the remyssion off sins than heretykes do / for the Iuys said /
what man is this that forgeueth sins / and ye heretyke says / I forgive / I
make clean / I sanctify. etc^.

These words be plain enough agenst you / for you say we have auctoryte to
remytte sins. And. S. Augustine says you be heretykes for so saying. you can
not deny / but. S. Augustine repreueth your own absolucion / where in you say
that your absolucion is requisite of necessite to remission of sins the
which is nothing else / but clearly denyinge of Christ of his blessed blood
and also of his holy word / but yff we had grace we might perseue yt neither
you / nor your absolucio^ / nor yet any thing that you do were of god / for
all that you do us clearly done for monny and for no another cause. Rekken one
thing that you do / as consernynge your mynistracyon / but that you will
have money for yt / not so much as washing of a hepe of stonnes. where by
have you gotten all your great possessions / but alonly under the color /
yt you be Christ's holy bisshops. Monye is a merchaunte
For monny you make whordom as lawfulle as matrimonye. For monye / stolen good
shall be better than heritage. For mo^nny / you make vsery lawfulle
merchandis. For money / all sins be virtue ye and also have grett perdon to
the^ For monny / you sell man / wife / maid and child king and Land. For
monny you make as good merchandis / of women's preuytyes / as a goldsmyth does
of gylted platte. you will rekken that this is a shame for me to write / but
yt is more shame for you to do yt / and if you did not these shamfulle deeds
I should have none occasyon to make this shamfulle wrytinge / take you away the
cause and I will take a way the wrytinge. ye you are not so content / but you
sell Christ you selle the blessed sacrament off his flesh and blood / you
selle his holy word / you selle all other sacraments / breuely you selle /
all manner of thing that ever he left in earth to ye comfort of man's solle /
and all for monny / ye and not so content but you make also molawes and mo
statutes / and dyspence with the^ for monny / and all these things do you /
by the auctorite of the keys / that both open heaven and hell / and a man's
coffer and also his pursse ye and sumtyme they loss the cotte from his back.
Our master Christ says unto you / you have reseued yt fre give yt fre again
/ and you give nothing fre / but I know your answer you will say that you
sell not your mass nor sacraments nor the word of god / but the labor
that you have about them. O thou deuylle when will thou be with out an excuse
/ when will thou grant they self gylty? Tell meye yt be with out shame /
if you do selle but your labor is it not sore and an vnlawfulle pryse to
selle yt so dear? what bishop ca^ deserve by his labor a thousand pound by
year / and yet some of them have a great delle more / and labor nothing at
all. How dear will these me^ selle their labor if they should be
tankerdeberars / they would make watter derar than wine / ye tell me what
labor there is with in the royalme that is half so dear sold as their
ydylnes is? But you bellygodes did not Christ's appostles take paynys and
labors / a bought the ministracion of the word? and in fulfyllynge of their
office / more in one day than you ^oo in all your lyuys / and yet was it not
lawfulle for them more to reseue thane a living: for our Master Christ said
/ the work man is worthy of his met / Mat. 10
so that our master would that they should reseue no more but necessary / 1.
Cor. 9^
Also S. Paul says our lord did orden that they which preche the gospelle
should live on the gospelle / mark how he says they that preche the gospelle
/ now which of you all does preche the gospel / Hierom.
not one and yet will you enjoy these innumerable possessions. Saint Hierom
says on his same text / you must live on the gospelle / Chrisosto ad Ti. 5.
but not be rich / also Chrisostom says / I say boldly that the bisshops and
prelates off the church / may have nothing but meat and drink and clothe.
etc^. Here have you planly / that if you did labor faith fully and truly in
the go gospelle / you could have but a living there on / and no lordly
possessions / but now do you nothing in the world / but exercysse tyranny on
the^ that would preche the gospelle / and make laws and statutes / to destroy
them / Chri. s. 6. de anathemate
and the holy gospelle of god / so that Chrisostom speaks well of you / Be
hold I see men that have no true sense of holy scripture / ye they
understand nothing at all thereof / and to pass over meny things (for I am a
shamed to call the^ mad men / try fyllars and wranglars) they be such as know
not what they say nor of what thing they speak / but alo^ly be they mighty
and bold to make laws / and to curse and condemn those things of ye which
they know no thing at all. etc^. Be not these your works? who can say /
but that these words be spoken of you? who makes statutes and laws but you?
who curses and co^de^neth but you? how cane you lay these things from you?
how can you avoid the^? so long shall they be laid against you / tylle you ca^
bring in one that is gyltye of the^ / I tkynke yt will be long / and yet
will you have these greet possessions / and be also greet lordis doing
nothing there fore at all / but allonly play ye part of a bishop / as a
Christemasse game player / does of a king / and as a puppet which springs
up and down and crythe pepe pepe and gothe his way / so do you make a
countenance of greet holiness / and of greet perfeccio^ / but all ye world ca^
testify what you do in deed. Moreover you are more bound to ye gospel / thane
all other men be in the world for there by have you all your honor / all
your riches / all your lordly possessions / and if ye gospelle were not /
men would no more regard you / thane they do cobblers / and yet deserve you
worste of all me^ of ye gospelle / wherefore I cane no more say un to you / but
ye words of our. m. christ / woe be unto you hipocrites ye which shyt heaven
gates a fore ohter me^ / and as. S. Luke says / Mat. 23. Luce. 11
you have taken away the key of sciens / and neither enter in your self / nor
yet suffer other yt come to enter in / now let me see / how all your keys /
and all your power cane asoylle you from this same woo that our Master
Christ does here lay unto you? This word of god byndeth you to everlasting
da^ nation let us see if your pykelocke cane open this lock / than will I say
that you have the keys off heaven or else not. I think you may seek all your
clogge with keys and find not one that will open this lock.

Finis.
Fre will of man / after the faulle of Adam / of his naturalle strength / cane
do nothing but sin.
IN this article will we not dispute / what man may do by the commen influence
given him of god / over these inferior and worldly things / as what power he
has in eating and drinking / in slepynge and speaking / in byinge and
selling / and in all other sache naturalle things that be given of god
indifferently to all men both to good and bad: but here will we search what
strength is in man of his naturalle power / with out the sprete of god / for to
will or to do those things that be acceptable a fore god / un to the
fulfyllynge of the will of god / as to believe in god / to love god after his
commandementes / to love justice for yt self / to take god for his father / to
rekken him to be mercifulle un to him to fete god lovyngely / with all other
things that men do caul good works / this is ye thing that we will search
to know. Johan. 15
Now that he cane do nothing in these causis by his fre will / our Master
Christ proves yt in these words he that a bydeth in me and I in him /
brings forth much fruit / for with out me can you do nothing / if a man
a bide not in me / he is cast out as a branche / and he shall burn. Here it
is open that frewylle with out grace cane do nothing I do not speak of
eating and drynkkynge (though that be of grace) but nothing that is
frutefulle / that is merytorius that is worthy off thank / that is acceptable
a sore god. For he that has not Christ in him / is cast out / this is the
first fruit of frewylle: than wydderth he / that is ye second fruit / this
wytherynge helps him nothing to goodness / he must wydder let him do his
best: than is he gathered and cast in the syer / this is ye third fruit /
what cane he in the fire do / nothing but burn / he cane not lie there as a
thing indyfferent / but he must needs burn / and he cane not come out of the
fire by his own strength / let him intend as much as he cane / his intencion
ca^ not help him / nor yet forther him. So yt all the might of frewylle whane
he is left a lone / is nothing else but first to be cast out / and second to
wyther so decays he / thyrdly to be cast in the fire / all this is worsse and
worsse: finally he burns / this is worst of all for here is he paste help /
so that this is the strength that frewylle has / to bring him self to utter
dystruccyon. Now where will our Duns men / bring in their bonum conatum /
they are so long in bringing of yt in / that frewylle is brought to the fire
and there cane he neither save him self from burning / nor yet help him self
out / but to this my lord / of Rochester answers in a serten place / that
frewylle cane do no good meritorius / sed tamen non oi^o facit nihil / what is
this to say but Nihil. yff he do no good that is meritorius / nor worthy of
thank a fore god / I pray you what does he but Nihil our disputacyon is /
what goodness yt he cane do with out grace / and you grant / that he cane do
no goodness / and yet you say that he cane do sumthyng / is not this a worthy
sayng for a bishop / for a doctor / yt will learn other me^ how to use the^
self with god / is not this a goodly saying to prove that man has frewille
thereby? but by such vain words / damnable blasphemus / does he deseue the
simple people / and makes the^ believe (by such words as they understand not)
that they have a naturalle might and power to deserve heaven / and to do all
manner of goodness. But let us se how. Super Io^nem trac. 81.
S. Augustine understands this text of. S. Johan / Lest any man should
suppose that the branche of him self could bring forth / at the least ways a
lytelle fruit / therefore says he not / with out me cane you do a lytylle /
but with out me cane you do nothing / therefore whether yt be lytylle / or
whether yt be much / with out him cane yt not be done / with out whom is
nothing done. won of two things must the branche needs do / either a bide in
the vine / or else burn in the fire yff yt be not in ye vine / thane is yt in
the fire. etc^ My lord where will you bring in here / your somthyng that
frewylle does. S. Augustine says / with out grace cane frewylle do / neither
little nor much / for if she be not in Christ / she burns in the fire /
call you that sumwhat? where be now Master Dunsys men with their bonu^ conatu^
/ bonu^ studiu^ / and applicacione^ ad bonu^ here must they needs lie in ye
fire / with all their good intentes / with their good preparacio^s / and their
holy disposicio^s. Also. 2. Co. 3.
s. Paul / we are not sufficient / to think any thing of our self / as it
were of our self / but our sufficiencye is of god / what is this yt we are
not abylle to think any thing of our self? what cane be a smaller thing
tha^ to think? and yet this small thing cane we not do / it is also open yt
Paul menyth not of ye thinking yt comes by natural power / for yt god does
not let / but lets it prosede after his first ordinance / as we have open
experyence in infideles / but here he speaks off such a thinking as is
acceptable / and thankeful a fore god / and therefore follows yt / god has
made us worthy minysters of the new testament / here is it open that he
speaks of that thinkinge / that is a singular and a specialle gift off god /
and not of the commen gift of nature / for that were nothing / to the
ministracyon of the gospelle. Barnard Lib. arbit.
But let us see what. S. Barnard says of this text / what shall we say? is
this allonly all the merytte of fre will that he does alonly consent? ye
doutles. Not that that same consent in the which is all his merytt / is not of
god / whane that we cane neither think (the which is less than to consent)
any thing of our self as though we were sufficient of our self / these
words be not mine / but the appostles the which gives un to god and not to
his fre will / all manner of thing that cane be good / that is to say / to
think / to will / or to perform. etc^.

Hear you not that all things / that cane be good. s. Barnard gives to god?
Now what strength has fre will / he cane neither think good / nor will /
nor yet perform yt / what remains? I know nothing but either yt is included
in thinking / in willing / or in performynge / and all these begeuen to god.
Also our Master Christ says shall men gether grappys of thornys / Mat. 7.
or fygges of brombylle busshys An evylle tree cane bring forth no good fruit.
what menyth our Master when he says / that grapys be not gethered of thornys?
nothing else / but that the fruit must belyke the nature of the tree / and
therefore says he / an evyll tree / cane not bring forth good fruit / now cane
you not deny / but that frewylle with out grace is an evyl tree / ergo his
fruit must needs be evelle / he may well bring forth fruit / but yt shall not
be good. Is not all frewyls power declared in these words / he ca^ not / I
pray you what meanethe our Master Christ in these words / he can not Christ
said / he can not / and will you say / he can? Mat. 12.
also our Master says / you adders birds / hov cane you speak good things
/ seeing that you be evylle / had not these men frewylle? and yet says our
Master they could not speak good things / you rekken yt but a small power /
to speak good and yet as small as yt is / frewylle cane not do yt / he may
well speak / but yt shall not be good / for how should he speak good / that is
evylle of him self? how should he do good that knows no good? but is the
very enymye of goodness / ye and as much as lyethe in him / he would there
were no goodness for if he would there were goodness / why does he yt not / you
have also a commen pryncipyll / there is nothing loved and desired but yt that
is known / now how should frewyll fly from sin and desyer goodness / and he
knows not which is very sin / and which not / As. S. Paul says / by the
law is the knowledge of sin / so blind is frewylle / Romans 3.
that he knows not sin to be sin nor virtue to be virtue / but judges
that thing to be good that is evell and that thing that is evylle to be good /
for he is lost and has no true judgment As. S. Augustine says / what
goodness cane he do that is lost / In E^he c. 29
except that he be delyuerd from his misery? Cane he do any good by his
frewylle? god forbid / for man evylle vsyng his frewille / did both less him
self and also his frewylle / and as a man being a live / does kylle him self
/ and when he has killed him self / he cane not make him self a live again.
So likewise when we do sin by frewylle / and sin has the victory / thane
is frewylle clean lost / for of whom a man is over comme unto him must he be
servant / doutles this sentence is of Peter the appostle / the which seeing that
yt is true / I pray you what manner of fredom cane a bond servant have /
except yt be when yt pleseth him to sin. etc^.

How think you by this / you defenders off frewyll / does he not clearly say
that man has lost his frewylle by sin? and cane no more do un to goodness /
than a deed man cane do to make him self a live again / ye he cane do
nothing but delyght in sin / call you that a fredom? de verbis apost. s. 11.
Call you that bonum conatum? Call you that a preparinge to grace? S. Augustine
does declare / what goodness that frewylle deserves / with out grace saying /
o cursed frewylle with out god / we have experience what frewille cane do with
out god / therefore are we miserable by cause we have experience what frewylle
is abylle to do with out god / behold man was made good / and by his frewill
was he made an evylle man / when shall an evylle man by his frewyll make a man
good? he being good / could not keep him self good / and now that he is evel
shall he make him self good? when that he was good he kept not him self
good and now yt he is evyll / shall he say I make mi self good? etc^

Here have you the very strength of frewille / by his strength are we made
miserable / and that does experience learn and yet will you boste frewyll. S.
Augustine calls yt cursed frewylle / and you do call yt blessed frewyll / is
not this a goodly fredom and greet power / to bring us to this everlasting
misery? This is your bonum conatum / and facere quod in se est / and preparare
se ad graciam with other damnable dremes that you have / whose conclusions are
nothing else but to bring us to damnacion / you se. s. Augustines words be so
plain that no man cane avoid them.

Also. S. Paul says / Roma. 8
the wysdom off the flesh is enymy to god / yt is not subject un to the law
nor cane be / for they that serve the flesh / cane not plese god / and he that
has not the sprete of Christ the same man is none off his / for the self
sprytte bears wyttnes to our sprete that we be the chyldern of god / here
have you plainly / that the wysdom of the flesh is very ennymy agenst god /
you cane not say / but by wysdom he understands the best thing yt is in man /
for better than wysdom cane there nothing be / and yet that is enymy to god for
yt is but flesh and all that is in man with out ye spreet of god / and that
S. Paul declares wha^ he says / he that has not the spreet of Christ / the
same man is not Christ's. Here is plain yt will / reason / wysdo^ / heart or
what so ever thing yt is in man is (with out ye sprete of god) but flesh and
cane not be obedient / he says not he will not / but he can not: he has no
might / he has no power / let him intend his best / do all that lies in
him / with all his might and all his power / and yet cane yt not please god /
for yt is all but flesh. But here Master Duns men will make a disticcion /
and say that flesh is taken here for fleshly desyers only and voluptuousnes /
and not for the desyers of the solle / nor for the eleccion of the will / I
would know of them / what part in man yt is / that desires / or that couyteth
this voluptuousnes / it is not the bonys nor ye synowes / nor ye flesh yt
hangs there on but yt is the highest part of man the very soul of man / he
is the ground and the auctor of all concupisens / take away him / and there
remanyth no voluptuousnes / therefore. S. Paul declares him and his operacion
/ when he calls yt the wisdom of the flesh / but I would gladly know / what
they understand / by unclean desyers / and by voluptuousnes / if they
understood / evylle cogitacions / as aduoutrye / fornycacio^ manslauter /
theft / covytusnes / dysseyt / uncleanness / blasphemy / pride / follyshenes /
if they caulle these voluptuousnes / these be they yt comme from the heart of
man / and be chosen by the eleccion of the will as our Master Christ does
clearly declare Marc.vii. ye and yt from ye very butto^ of ye heart / Mat. 7
cane they invent any other uncleanly desyers than these? and these come not
from the bonys / nor from the synowes nor from ye inferior part of the heart /
but from the very grovnde of the heart / and these be all his desyers / and
other has he none of him self. where these dremers dreme they wotte not what
/ and speak that they understand not / for all that is in man / heart / soulle
/ flesh / and bone. etc^. with all their works / is but flesh / except the
sprett of god be there / every man has a soul / but by that is he not
Christ's / for than infidels were Christ's / but the sprete of Christ makes
him Christ's / and the sprete of god gives wytnes to our sprete that we be
the chyldern of god / our spritte gives no wytnes to him self / yt he is
Christ's / for thane were ye sprete of god frustrate wherefore let our spreet
intend as well as he cane / studdy his best / a plye him self to goodness /
after the uttermost of his power and yet is it but wysdom of the flesh and
has no wytnes of god / ye it is but an enymy and yt must needs be sin / for
As. S. Augustyn says / he that fedith with out me / De verbis dn^i sermo. 50.
fedythe agenst me. etc^. Mark how be says agenst me / wherefore all that fre
will can do with out gra^e is but sin / Mark also yt Paul did write un to
the Iuys / ye and to ye best of them which did stodye to do good workis ye and
that the best workis that were the workis of ye law and yet all the se he
calls but flesh / and declaryth opynly yt all these good workis could not
help them / and yet no doubt but yt ye Iues did as much as lay in their
frewyll to do to come to ye favor off god / and yet it ho^pe not for all was
but wysdo^ of the flesh / and enymy to god / also. S. paul say the. To. 8.
If you mortify the dedys of ye flesh by the spret / you shall live / you will
not rekkyn that Saint paul does Judge ye spret of god necessary / to kylle
the desyers of the flesh / yt is of ye synowes or of the bonis / or of any
other thing yt is in man by side ye sprett of man / for that were but a small
thing ye it were but frustratt to set the spret of god to kille these
thyngis / for ye sprete of man can kylle them / ye and also rule the^ / for
after your own Philosophers / ye spret of man / is the ruler and the gyder of
all the workis / yt be done by the body / wherefore the spret of god must be he
/ yt shall kill the disease of our spret / the which is the most spiritual
thing in us and yet is it but flesh a fore god / for if there ware any power
in him / hye or low / De verbis apostoli. s. 13.
to kill his desiers / tha^ were yt but void to call the sprett of god to help
/ but let us here what. S. Augustine says on this text / if you mortify the
flesh. etc^. Thou wylt say / that can my will do that can my fre will do. what
will / what manner offer will? except yt he gyde the thou fallyst / except he
lift ye up thou lie still / how can thou tha^ do it by thy spret / seeing
yt the apostle says As many as be led by ye spret of god / be the childerne
of god / will thou do of thy self? will thou be led of thine own self / to
mortify the dedys of the felshe? what will it profyt the (for if thou be not
voluptuus with the Epicu^r / thou shall be proud with the stoykes) whyther
thou be an Epicuer / or a Scoicus? Thou shall not be a mo^ge ye childern of god
/ For they yt be gydid of the spret of god / be the children of god / not they
yt live after their own felshe / not they yt live after their own spret / not
they yt be led of their own spret but as meny as be led of the sprett off god
/ they be the chyldern of god / but here a man will say / Ergo tha^ arewe rulid
and we do not rule I a^swere Thou both rulist and art rulid / but tha^ do
thou well rule if thou be ruled of ye good spret / utterly if thou want the
spret of god / thou can do no good / thou do truly with out his help by
thy frewill / but it is but evil done / un to yt is thy will which is callid fre
will / and by evil doing is she mad a damnable bound serua^te / wha^ I say with
out the help of god thou do nothing I understood by it no good thing for
too do evil / thou have frewil / with out ye help of god / though yt be no
fredo^. wherefor you shall know yt so do you goodness / if ye helping spret be
your gyder / the which if he be abse^t ca^ do no good at all. etc^. My think
this saing a lone wereable too co^fou^d you all / if you would believe. S.
August. Mark how he says with out the spret of god you lie still in sin /
let your spret do the best he can / for they be not ye chyldern of god yt live
after their own spret / yt are gydyd after their own spret but after ye spret
of god for our spret can do no good at all / but evil if the spret do not
led him / where is now your bonu^ studiu^ your bonus conatus / and
applicacio ad bonu^. etc^. For your spret ca^ do nothing but evil and is of
him self but a damnable servant / what good can a damnable servant do of him
self? So that here have you openly proved / that the frewil of man / of his
own strength and of his own power can do nothing but sin?

But now co^mithe the damnable reason and fleshely wisdom and will dispute and
say if our frewyll ca^ do no goodness / what need god to co^ma^de so meny good
thingis? what ned god to give those co^ma^dime^tis that he knows well be
impossible for us? and if they be impossible what right is in him that da^neth
us for yt thing yt is impossible for us to do / I answer o thou blind
presumtuous / and damnable reason / where haste thou lernyd of any other
creature to inquier a cause of thy makers will / or ellis to murmur / agenst
the ordynance of thy lyuinge god / what have thou to do / to requier a cause of
his actis? he has made yt with out thy consent and counsel and may he not
set law is and conma^deme^tis to rule yt by at his plesur with out counsel?
thou artworthy of none answer / thou art so presu^tuus nor there is no godly
a^swere yt will satifyse yt Never the less I will stope thy blasphemynge mouth
/ by thine own wysdom to thy great shame. First this thing must thou grant me
/ yt thy god is Essencial goodness / and is nothing but goodness / wherefore he
can command nothing / but yt is good / Just and rightus / which thngys if thou
do not or be not abylle to do Thy maker may not let his goodness undone by
cause of thy naughtynes / or for thine un a byllnes / And if thou biste not
abille to do those good thyngis that he commandyth the / There is no fault in
the commander / nor yet in the commandimentis / wherefore than doste thou grudge
agenste him with out a cause? But yet will thou murmur and say how that he
knows how they be impossible for the / Truth yt is he knows it / Than wylt
thou say / wherefore does he command them to me? O thou presumtuous creature it
were suffycyently a^swered to the to say that it is his plesur so to command
what could thou say more / what occasyon had thou to murmur? what vro^g
haste thou? But I will go forther thy maker knowythe that they be impossible
for the he knowithe also / thy damnable and presumtuous pride / that rekkynest
how thou canste do all thyngis yt be good of thine own strength with out any
other help / and to subdewe this presumtuous pride of thine / and to bring ye
to knowledge of thine own self / he has geuyng yt his commaundymentes of yt
which thou canste not complain / for they be both righttus and good And if
thou complain by cause they be impossible for the / thane consider thy
damnable pride / that thoughtest thy self so strong yt thou could do all
goodness / But what wylt thou now do these commandimentis be geuyn and cannot
nor shall not be changyd to satysfyse thy presu^tuus pride / where of will
thou now complain? gods comma^dimentes be reasonable / they be good / they be
righttus / and they be laudable / shall all these things be dystroyd to
satisfyse thy pride / nay not so / But thou shalt rather remain / with all
thy pride under the damnacion of these commandimentes / what say thou there
to? ca^ste thou avoid this? canste thou say but this is right / canste thou
save thy self from danger / canste thou a void thy damnacion by all thy
carnalle wysdom? nay verily / for he that is thy adversary is omnipotent where
fore say what thou wylt / So must it be / for it is gods ordinance which may
not be cha^gyd. But now will thou ask what remydy? no remydy but this wonly /
to confess thy wekenes / to confess thy pride / to knowledge thy vnabyllnes /
to grant that these commandymentes be lawfulle holy and good / and how thou
art bound to keep them / and to give laud and praise to god for them / and
to go to thy mercyfulle maker with this confession / and to desyer him that he
will help the / that he will be mercifulle un to the / yt he will strength
the for thou art to weke / That he will give the his spret / for thy spret is
to fleshely / to fulfylle these spritualle commandementes and doubt thou not
but thou shall find him both mercy fulle and also gracious for he gave you
these commandymentes for that intent / secretly declaryng both thy pride and
also thy wekenes / yt thou might seek and call un to him for help

This does S. Augustine declare well in these wordis / de tempo. ser. 5.3
if man do perseue that in the co^mandymentes / is any thing impossible or else
to hard / let him not remain in him felfe / but let him run un to god his
helper / yt which has geuyn his commandimentes for ye intent / that our
desyer might be sturryd vpe and that he might give help etc^. Mark. S.
Augustine says that the commandymentes be impossible un to our stre^gthe /
but we must call to god for strength. The palagio^s did rekyn / that they had
got a grett vyctordu^ when they had made this carnalle reason / that God would
command nothing that was impossible / of this reason did they glory and
tryumphe and thought that they must needs have some naturalle strength and
power to fulfylle the commandimentes of god / seeing that god would command
nothing impossible to man. Off this same reason does my lord of rochester and
all his scollars glory unto this same day But let us see how S. Augustine
answeryth them / D^li. arb. cap. 16.
The palagions (says he) think that they know a wonders thing / when they
say God will not command that thing the which he knows / that is
impossibille for man to do / Every man knows this / but there fore does he
command sertyn things / that we ca^ not do / Eccle. 12.
by cause we might know / what thing we ought to ask of him / Faith is she
which by prayer optaynyth that thing that the law commandithe / breuely he that
says / If thou will thou may keep my comma^dimentes / In the same book a
littille after says / he shall give me keeping in my might Plain it is that
we may keep the commandime^tes if we will / but by cause our will is
prepared of god / off him must it be asked / that we may so much will / as
will suffice us to do them / troth it is / that we will / when we will /
but he makyth us to will that thing yt is good. Here have you p^ayne that my
lord of Rochesters opinion and the palagyons is all won / for they both do
agree that the commandimentes of god / be not impossible to our natural
strength But S. Augustine says they be impossible / And therefore be they
geuyn that we should know our wekenes / and also ask the strength to fulfille
the^ / For faith by prayer does obtain strength / to fulfylle / the
impossible commandimentes of the law. Here have you also / that god mouythe us
and causythe us to be good willers / and geuythe us a good will for else we
would never will / but eville. Here is also to be notyd / That the palagions
and our duns men a gre all in won / for they both say / that the grace of
god does help man's good purposse so that man does first inte^d and purpose
well / and as duns says disposithe him self by attricion to reseue grace /
and tha^ god does help him / but ye troth is contrary for there is no good
purposse in man / no good disposicio^ nor no good intent but all is against
goodness / and clean contrary against all thing yt agreyth with grace / tille yt
god of his mere marry comythe and geuythe grace and cha^githe ma^s will un to
grace / and geuyth him a will to will goodness / ye and that wha^ he thought
nothing of goodness / But did clearly resist all goodness / This does S.
Augustine prove in these words The pelagio^s say / Ad bonif. li. 2. ca. 9.
yt they grant how ye grace does help every ma^s good purposse but not yt he
geuithe ye love of virtue to him / yt siriuyth age^ste it This thing do they
say as though man of him self with out the help of god / has a good purpose
and a good mind un to virtue / by ye which merit presedynge a fore / he is
worthy to be holpyn of ye grace of god yt follows after / doutles ye grace yt
follows does help ye good purposse of man / but yt good purposse should
never have been / if grace had not preceded / And though that the good study of
man when it begynnyth is holpyn of grace / yet did yt never begin with out
grace. etc^ Here is yt open / that the palagions grant as much of grace / as
my lord of Rochester does and all his Duns men which lerneth that man may
have a good purposse / bonum studiu^ / and a good mind / and a love un to
grace / off his own naturalle strength / the palagions grant even the same /
but here you se hov. S. Augustine is clear agenste them. But now let us here
master Dunssys words / a sinner may by the naturalle / 4. Sent. D^. 14. q. 2
and by the commen influence of god consider his sin / As a thing that has
offended god / and as a thing contrary to the law of god / and lets him
from reward and brings him to pain / and by this menis may he hatte / and
abhor his syn this calls he attricion where by there is a disposicion / or
a merytt in man of congruence to take a way mortalle sin / and this attricion
is sufficient for a man / that shall reseue the sacraments / et quod non ponat
obicem / that is / that he have no mortalle sin actually in his will / this
is sufficient and also a necessary way to reseue grace. etc^. This is tentymys
worse than the palagions saynges / for they grant that man must needs have a
specialle grace / to perform his good purposse / and Master Duns says / that
man may perform his attricion of his naturalle power / ye and this attricion
of congruence / is a disposicion to take away mortalle sin with out any
specialle grace / I pray you master Duns off what congruence is it? what has
attricion deserved / that mortalle sin must be taken away for his pleasure /
what has he deserved / ye grace must follow him / Infideles may have this
attricio^ (for you grant / that yt comyth of natural strength) and yet shall
it not follow of congruence / that they must reseue grace / and also remission
of their syns. Also had not Judas this attricion / when he said / I have sinned
/ and was sorry for his syn / and also repentyd him / and knew well that he had
offendyd god / ad also deseruid pain And was no more willing so to do and had
all you propertes yt longs to your Attricion / ad yet you se how he did
deserve of co^gruence grace and remissyon of his syns ye did not this attricio^
bring him to extreme disperacy on / How can a man with out a special grace /
abhore his sin / it is not possible but he must love sin / so long as he
is ye enemy of god / ye he would there were no god to punish syn / such a
plesur has he un to syn / This is ye nature off our hartis / and that does
every of us feale / Though these hipocrittis learn the contrary / but I say to
the^ ye wordis of ye prophet redite ad cor preuaricatores / grope in your
boso^ hipocritis / and there find you ye mortal enemy of god which neither
carith for godis displesur / nor yet for his sin / and you say yt he may have
a good attricyon / of his natural strength / and if this attricio^ be good /
than may he do good a fore grace / so yt we shall gether / grappis of thornis /
and fygis of briars / but what says. S. paul to your good attricyon / He
says yt all thing with out faith is sin / you addersbirdis / is not this man
a fleshely man? and has nothing of ye spret of god (for by your own lerning
he has but the common in fluence) and yet (shall he be sorry yt he has
offendyd god? shall he abhore his sin? Shall he dispose him self of
co^grue^ce to grace? S. paul says / ye flesh lustithe contrary to ye spret /
and the works of ye flesh be Aduoutry / fornicacio^ / uncleanness Idolatry /
wytchcraft / hatred / wrath / zele / sedycyon / Enuyynge with such other / I
pray you how do these workys agree with you. e Attrycyon Call you this
abhorringe of sin? Call you this heuenes yt he has offendyd god? Be these
your good disposicio^s? be these your good preparacions un to grace? Think
you that these workys / do deserve of co^grue^ce remission of mortalle sin?
These be the best workis yt a sinner has in his heart / or ellis. S. paul
lies / wherefore it is not possible but he must have in his will actual sin
/ for he can will nothing but sin And therefore if he reseue the sacraments
with your attricio^ / he reseueth the^ to his da^nacio^ for a fore grace he is
an utter ennimy to god and to all his sacramentis wherefore god must of his
mere mercy mollyfy his heart / and give him grace to will goodness / or ellis he
can never do it / As Saint Augusti. does declare in these wordys / De
predesti. ca. 8.
The grace which is geuyn of ye largenes of god preuely in to men's hartis / can
not be dispisyd off no manner of hard heart / For therefore is it given ye the
hardness of ye heart should be taken away wherefore wha^ the father is herd
with in / and does learn yt we must come to his son / Tha^ takes he away
our stony heart / and gives us a fleshely heart / and by this menys he makyth
us ye childern of promys and ye vessellis of mercy / which he has preparid to
glory But wherefore does he not learn al me^ to come to christ? By cause yt
those yt he lerneth / he lernyth of mercy / and those yt he lerneth not of his
judgment does he not learn them. etc^. Mark yt. S. Augustine. says That
there is no hardness of heart yt can resyst grace and Duns says / That there
may be an obstakill in ma^s heart. S. Augusti. says yt grace fyndeth the heart
in hardness and obstinacye / And Duns says yt there is a mollifyng yt
precedythe grace which he callith attricio^. S. Augusti. says wha^ you father
lernith us with in / tha^ takith he away our stony hartis / and duns says
that we ca^ do it by ye co^me^ natural influe^s that is we can disposse our
self of co^grue^s / Mark also how all me^ / be not taught to come to christ /
but allonly they yt be taught / of marcy be taught: and if it be of mercy /
than it is not of congruens by attricion Breuely A greter heresy / more
contrary to christ and his blessed word can no man learn / and yet must he be
taken for a great clarke / and a subtle doctor by cause he plesithe ye flesh
/ but shortly here have I openly proved by invincible scriptur and by doctors
of great auctorite that frewyll of his natural strength with out a special
grace can do nothing but a bide in sin / Feign Invent / Excogitate / dream /
as meny holy purposys as you can / as meny subtylle distyncions as meny good
attricions / as meny good applycacions as you can and all they be but sin /
till grace come / ye your sleping / your eating / your drinkyng / your alms
/ your prayers / your singing / your ringing / your confessing / your
mu^bling / your murning / your wayllinge / breuely all yt you ca^ do is but
hyppocrisy / and dubbille sin a fore god till the time / that he of his mercy
chousyth you / for as he says / you have not chosyn me but I have chosyn you.

Now will I declare a scripture or two that you bring to prove your conatum
and your bonum studium / The first place is this / God from the begenyng did
ordyn man / and left him in the hondis of his own cou^selle / he did give him
his co^ma^deme^tis / and his preceptis / if thou will keep ye co^ma^deme^tis /
and also keep pesable faith / for ever they shall keep yt I have set before the
water and fire strech thy hond to which thou will / Of this place gether you /
yt man may have a good purpose a god intent / a good mind / to apolye him self
to god of his natural power But this can you not prove of this text / for
here is never a word / of inte^dynge / of studying / or of applyyng well / for
if you will take the words off the text as they sunde they rather prove that
we may keep the commandementis of god / ye and also believe in god / than any
other thing / the which I am suere you will not grant / for than how could
you a void but that the philosophers be sauyd / for no man ca^ deny / but yt
they did as much / as lay in their natural power to come to god? Moreover the
palagyons bring this text / too prove that man may do good of his natural
strength / Now how will you avoyde them? For if you deny that yt prouythe their
opinion (for the which the wordis sound most) than will they deny yt yt
prouythe your conatum / and your bonum studiu^ / of ye which yt text spekyth
never a word where for this text makes nether for them nor yet for you /
Plain it is / yt the words of the text sound of keeping and of beleuinge if
we will / and not of inte^dinge / nor of studying wherefore it makes not for
your purposse / but let us go to the text / God from the begeninge did make man
/ these wordis be opyn of the creacion / of the first man: Eccle. 16.
he left him in the hondis of his own counselle / These wordis / make nothing
for frewill for here is nothing co^mandyd him to do but allonly here is
sygnifyde that man is made Lord over all inferior creatours / to use them / at
his plesur / as yt is opyn. Genesys. 2. where that all things were brought a
fore Adam to reseue their namys / sygnyfiyng that they were all left un to his
use and to his will / and he was lord over them all / and none over him /
this was his kyngdu^ in the which he did rain / and govern all thyngis
after his co^mandimentes / but yet was it by the generalle influence / geuyn
him first of god: he did add his commandimentes and his precepts / In these
words is there no power geuin unto him / but here be geuyn him commandime^tes
/ whereby he must be orderyd and ruled / And not rule after his own counselle /
but after the counselle / and commandimentes of God / where fore by these
commandimentes / was there part of his fre dominacyon / and lordeschyp / that
he had over the inferior things takyn a way / as where god commanded him that
he should not eat of the tree of knoulege both of good and evil / Now was it
not fre for him to use this tree after his own will but after the comma^deme^t
of god / and what power he had / by his frewille / to keep this commandime^t
the effect did declare. If thou wilt keep the commandimentes here begynythe ye
doubt but yet of these words cane you not gether / that he had power to keep
them / nor yet that he might inte^d to keep the^ / For it follows not / if
thou will / ergo thou may / or thou may intend / As it follows not If I
would / ergo I culde deposse you / for you will let this consequent / Also you
have a general rule / Condicionalis nihil ponit / where fore these words If
thou will keep ye comma^dimentes geuithe no power nor strength to frewille /
But this alonly follows of this text / if man will keep ye comma^dime^tes /
August. de li. arb. c. 16
tha^ they shall keep him / but now where shall he have this will / that is
not in his power / but look of S. Augustine above resyted / and there shall
you find how man co^mithe by this will / Also ye words of the text be not /
if thou will thou may keep the^ or inte^de to keep the^ / Nor they be not
man may keep the^ or intend if he will / But if thou will keep them / tha^
they shall keep yt / where fore of these words cane you not conclude any
power in man For it follows not wha^ god says / do this / do that / here
this / here that / keep this / keep yt / if thou will here / if thou will do
this / if thou will do yt / That we cane do these things or cane intend to do
the^ / for god commands us to do al thing yt is good / ergo we be abille of
our naturalle stre^gthe to do them? Than were the sprete of god frustrate /
for the sprete of god is not geuyn us / to give co^ma^dimentes but for to give
us strength / to fulfylle / and righttusly to understand those things yt be
commanded us. By the comma^dimentes is declared that thing that we ought to do
/ and also they show our wekenes and imbecylite that we might learn to seek
for a gretter strength and gretter help than is in us / As. S. Augustine
faith in these words. Aug. de verb. apost. s. 13.
The law was geuyn that man might find him self / and not to make his syknes
holle / but that by his preaching the syknes incresyd / the physician might be
sought. wherefore the law thretnyng / and not fulfillyng that thing that he
commands / makythe a man to be underneath him / but the law is good if a man
do use it well? By the law to know our syknes and to seek gods help to
help us etc^. Here is it plain / that the commandymentes of god give us no
strength / nor yet declare any strength to be in us / but shewythe us our
duty and also our wekenes / and also moves us / and causythe us to seek for
der for stre^gthe / So that these words si volueris / si feceris / si audieris
/ si emu^daueris / si vis / with all other such that be words of
co^ma^dimentes or words under a condycion / do nothing declare but what we are
bound to do / and what shall follow if we do them / And as the words of the
law do thretyn an yvylle end for sin alonly for to fere evylle doars / and
wykkyd persons from evyl / so do the words of promys stur vpe and quickyn good
men's hearts for to do well and also comfort them that they should not dispare
in aduersites / but nether these nor those give us any strength to do that
that is commandyd but alonly they do declare / what paynis and what reward
shall follow to the brekers / and the kepers of them.

A another scriptur have you where as our Master christ says / Mat.. 23.
How of tyn would I have getheryd thy childern / and thou woldste not Here cry
you / liberu^ arbitriu^. li. arb. For if they had no frewille what ned our M.
to say thou woldste not? First must we consider that there are.ii. manner of
wills in god / won is called his godly will or his secret or vnscrutable
will / where by that all things be made and orderd / and all things be
done. Of this will no creature has knowledge what he ought there by to do or
not to do / for as S. Paul says / it is inscrutable / and there fore it is
sufficient for us / to know there of alonly that there is an inscrutable will.

^e. ^.
The other will in god is called a declared and a manyfestyd will / The which
is declared and geuyn to us in holy scripturs / This will was showed un to us
to the uttermost by our Master christ the son of god / and therefore is it
lawfulle / and also all men are bound to serch^ to know this will and for
that consideracyon was it manyfested un to us This will does declare what
every man is bound to do / and what everye man is bound to fly / And by this
will is offeryd unto every man / those things that be of salvation / and by
this will god will have no man damned / Now he that will know this will
must go to our Master christ in whom as S. Paul says be all tresurs of
wisdom and sciens / So that he will show us as much as is necessary for us to
know / and as much as the father of heuyn would we should know / Now to the
text / here speaks god that is incarnatyd that was sent to will / to speak /
to do / to preche / to be famylier with us / to do myrakylles ye and also to
suffer death for our salvation / Now says he / I would have getheryd my
childern / that is to say I did preche / I did labor with all diligence to
convert the / I did miracles a fore ye / ye I wept I wayllyd for thy sake /
all these things did I with all other things that might be to thy
convercio^ and that belonged to god incarnate to do / but all these things
did not profit them / and why? By cause they would not. In him was there no
fault / For there was nothing undone / that belonged to him to do / so that he
was willing and yet did it not profit Jerusalem / And whi by cause they would
not. But now why would they not / by cause it was in their power to will to
consent and to will not to consent / nay truly / but by cause as Johan says
they culde not believe / for he had blinded their yies / Joan. ^^
and hardenyd their hearts / yt they should not see with their yies nor
understand with their hearts / So that they must needs alo^ly will not to
consent / and culd no another wisse do but not consent / and yet were they
neither constrained nor compelled / nor wrong to it by violence / but freely
they would not consent / and yet had they the liberte of their frewille that was
to be agenst christ and not to be with him / for the liberte of frewille
sto^deth not in this that he may will this thing / and also will the contrary
there of / But it stondeth in that that althyng that he will or will not is
at his own will and is not there to constranyd but wills it freely with out
any compulsyon / and yet he can not chouse no nor will not chose so to will
or so not to will / So that there is a necessite immutable / but not a
necessite of compulsyo^ or coaccion / now is it opyn that this place makythe
not for you for there was no power / nor none intent in their frewille to
consent un to christ / but to will the contrary and not to will un to him and
all was by cause they were blindyd and their hearts were hardenyd / and
therefore of their natural strength culde they no another wysse do / but varaye
from christ no they would nor desyeryd no another wise but to swarve from him /
But wherefore they were blyndyd and wherefore they were hardenyd that must you
inquier of ye inscrutable will / that plesyd him so to leave the^ the cause there
of I am suer he cane tell you if he would / I am suer it is ryghtwyselye done
/ But now commit^e the blind and fleshely reason and murmureth at this and
asks / why are we condemned for this? why does god punish us for this /
seeing we cane will no another wysse / also he blyndeth us / he makes our
hearts hard that we ca^ not amend us / and yt lies not in ou^e power with out
his will / now why complayneth he of us? why lays he it to our charge? here
is nothing done but his will / we be but instruments of his will / and if we
do not well why geuethe he us not strength to do better? Thou damnable reason
who can satisfye the which rekeneste nothing to be well done but yt yt thou
doste and that is do^ne at thy counsel. Think thou not / that thou art
good and perfytt in thine own nature / and all yt is in yt is both well and
ryghtwysly made? to this thou will answer ye / for thou will not condemn thy
self nor nothing yt is thine / but now answer me to this / what has made yt
so well / and give ye all this ryghtwysnes and all this goodness yt thou haste:
thou must needs say god / but what was the cause yt thou art so well / so
ryghtwyse and so good made / seeing yt thou deserved nothing / ye and all
these things / be done so well and so ryghtwysly / that thou canste not
complain / nor amend the^ / no nor yet devysse which way to a mend the^ /
now why dooste thou not murmur agenst god seeing that all thing is done with
out thy knowledge / and also with out thy deseruyng / why do thou not inquier
a cause of him? why murmureste thou not that he has made the so good and so
right / seeing thou hadste nothing deserved / but here will thou grant / that
god did all thing for the best / why dooste thou not like wysse in other
things / forthermore / thou must needs grant / that god thy maker / and the
governer of all things is most wise / most ryghtwyse / and most mercifulle
and so wise / that nothing that he does cane be a mended / so ryghtwyse yt
there cane be no suspycion in him of un right wysenes / ^o mercyfulle is he
that he cane do no thing with out mercy / how thinkeste thou / will thou
grant these things off thy maker? thou must needs grant them. Now compare
unto this rule / thy blyndnes that is with in the / thy induracion that is in
the / thy perverse will toward goodness / and what cause haste thou to
complain? thou have granted that he does all thing ryghttusly / ergo thou
haste no wrong / he does all thing mercifully / ergo thou art in thy
blyndnes and in thy hardness better intreted than thou haste deserved. Moreover
/ thou beleuest that god is ryghtwyse / that god is wysse / and that god is
mercyfulle / now faith is of those things that do not apere / nor that cane be
proved by exterior causys / hold the fast to this faith / than all thy
fleshely reasons be asoyled / for when god saves so few men / and dammeth so
meny / and thou know no cause why / yet must thou believe that he is
mercyfulle and ryghtwyse / this is faith which if yt could be proved by
exterior causys / than were yt no need to believe yt / now if thou believe that
he is mercyfulle good and ryghttus un to the / wherefore murmurste thou? But yet
would thou know wherefore he indurateth ye and blyndeth the and gives the no
grace to a mend / and un to thy brother / yt has no better deserved than thou
haste / ye he has lykewysse evylle deserved as thou haste and yet he gives
him grace / and takes away his hardness / and gives him a will to will all
goodness / this is not indifferently done as thou thynkest.

First I say to the thou haste no cause to complain / for thou haste no wrong
/ thou have all thing that is thine / and nothing is taken from the / that
belongs to the / why doste thou complain of this right? ye but yet say
thou that he gives the one marcy and gives the other none / I answer what is
that to the / is not his mercy his own? Is yt not lawfulle for him to give yt
to whom he will? is thy yie evyll by cause he is good? Mat. 20
Take that that is thine and goo thy way / for if yt be his will to show
his wrath / and to make his power known / over the vesseles of wrath /
ordened to damnacion / Romans 9.
and to declare the Riches of his glory / un to to the vessels of mercy which
he has prepared and elected unto glory / what haste thou there with to do?
what cause haste thou there off to complain? yt is the will of god which can
not be but well and ryghtwyse / the which (as thou say) thou beleuest /
wherefore leave of thy murmurryng and thy disputacion agenst god / and rekken
that he is of his nature mercifulle / and has no delytte nor no pleasure in
thy damnacion / but believe thou steadfastly / that if he she we his mercy / but
un to one man in all ye world that thou shall be that same one man / and
though an Angelle would make the believe that all the world should be damned /
yet stycke thou fast to his mercy / and to his justice that iustifye the / and
believe that the sweet blood of his blessed son can not be shed invayne / but
it must needs justify sinners and so meny as stycke fast unto yt / though they
be never so blinded and never so hardened / for yt was shed alonly for them /
if thou canste thus satisfye thy self / tha^ do thou well / and thou art
doutles out off iuperdy / but if thou wyllte not be content / but wyllte
dispute and inquier causis of gods inscrutable will / than will I stond by /
and look on and se what vycterdomme thou shall get I doubt not but yt will
repent the / and that he will conclude with the / on this manner: may not I do
what I will? Now here have I answered / to an intricable doubt / that our
scolle men are wrapped in which would know what is the cause of predestinacion
/ and of reprobacion / Scotus. ^ sent. Di. 41.
Duns being wrapped by twene carnalle reason / and the invincible scripturs
of. S. Paul / can not tell whether he may grant yt the will of god is
alonly the cause of eleccion or eis any merits of man precedinge a fore / he
concludes / that both the opinions may be defended. Bonaventure blyndly
concludes that there may be a cause presedynge grace that deserves yt.
Bonaventure.
So yt in these vnfrutefulle questions which engender nothing but contencion
have they spent all their lyuys / and for these things be given un to them
peculyer namys / as Subtylle / and Seraphicalle / and Irrefrigable doctors /
but agenst them all I set. S. Paul which took intolerable labors to prove
by invincible scripturs and examples there of / that there was no cause but
alonly the will of god and to prove this / he brings an euydent example of
Jacob / and Esau / of the which Jacob was elect / and Esau reproved a fore
they were borne / and before they had done other good or bad Can there be a
playner example? what meneth Paul in these words? whane they were neither
borne / nor had done neither good nor bad / but that the eleccion of god might
stond? does he not clearly take away all manner of merytes both de congruo and
also de condigno / and declares alonly the will of god to be the cause? but
here will the subtylle blyndnes say / yt god saw a fore that Jacob should do
good and therefore did he chousse him / he saw also that Esau should do no good
/ and therefore he repelled him / you blind gydd^s / what will you judge of that
that god saw? how know you that he saw yt? These chyldern be un borne / and
they have done neither good nor bad / and yet one of the^ is chossen and the
other is refused. S. Paul knows none other cause but yt will of god / and
will you discuss an other? And where you say yt god did se before ye one of
the^ should do good I pray you what was ye cause / or whereby saw he yt he should
do good? you must needs say / by yt yt he would give him his grace / ergo yt will
of god is yet ye cause of eleccion / for by cause yt god would give him his
grace therefore god saw yt he should do good / and so should also ye other have
done yff god would have given him that same gra^e / wherefore you gyantes that
will subdue heaven and earth leave your searching off this cause / and be
content with the will of god and doubt you not but the will of god / is as
rightwyse and as lawful a cause of eleccion as your merits can de. And doubt
you not but. s. Paul (that took so great labors in this matter) did se as
far in man's deseruynge as you cane do / Roma. 9.
and yet he concluded with these words of scriptures / I will show mercy to
whom I show mercy / I will have compassyon of whom I have compassyon / so
lythe yt not in man's will or runnynge but in the mercy of god. He says not
I will have mercy on him that I see shall do good / but I will show mercy
to whom I will: he says not I will have compassion of him that shall
deserve yt de congruo / Augustinus super Joan. Tract. 8^.
but of him of whom I will have compassion, This does. S. Augustine well
prove in these words / the disputacion of them is vain the which do defend
/ the presciens off god agenste the grace of god and therefore say that we were
chossen a fore the making of the world / by cause that he knew a fore that we
should be good / not by cause he should make us good: but he that says you
have not chosen me says not that / for if he did therefore chouse us by cause
that he knew a fore that we should be good / than must he also know a fore /
that we should first have chosen him. etc^.

Here is it plain that the eleccion of god is not by cause he saw a fore that
we should do well / but alonly the cause of the eleccion is his mere mercy /
and the cause of our doing well is his eleccion / and therefore. S. Paul
says not off works but of calling.

Now goo to you subtylle Duns men with all your carnal reasons and search
out a cause of his secrett will. yff you did believe that he were good /
rightwise and mercyfulle yt were agreet comfort for you / that the eleccion
stood alonly by his will / for so were you suer that it should be both
rightwyselye done and also mercyfully / but you have no faith and therefore must
you needs mystrust god / and of that fall you to inve^t causys of eleccyon of
your own strength as one should say by cause god will not of his
right^usnes or of his mercy chousse us we will be suer yt we shall be elected
/ for first will we invent yt the eleccion comes of deseruyng and tha^ will
we also dreme ser^en works / yt shall there unto be a poynted of us / so that
the eleccion and reprobacion stondeth all in your hondes.

But now because that there be serten open places of scriptur / that give wonly
the cause / to god alonly of eleccion and also of reprobacion / therefore are
you sore troubled / and cane tell no another remydy / but alonly to studdy /
how you may wring and wrest the open scripturs / to yt forrefyynge of your
error and to the satisfysynge of your carnalle reason / so that in ye the
holy ghost says / I will obdurate the heart of pharao / you will take a pon
you / to learn and to teach the holy ghost to speak better / and to say of
this manner / I will suffer Pharao to be indurated / but I will not do yt /
but my easynes my softness where by that I shall suffer him shall bring
other men to repentance / but Pharao shall it make more obstinate in mallyce
so that god does indurate (as you say) when he does not chastise a sinner but
shows sofftenes and easynes and sufferaunce to him. Origin in per^arcon
He is mercifulle when he does call a sinner to repentance by affliccion and
scorgyng / so that induracion after your exposicion / Glossa. roma. 5.
is nothing else but for to suffer evylle / by sofftenesse and by goodness /
to have mercy is nothing else but to correct to scorge and to ponishe me^
for their sins: this is the exposicion of induracion after Origenen. S.
Hierom / and after your commen gloss. Hiero. super Esaiam.
S / Hieroms words be these god does indurate / when he does not by and by
castigate a sinner / he has mercy when he does call a sinner by and by un to
repentance by affliccions. etc^.

This is auctorite enough as you think / what should you search any forther
did not these men understand scripture? is not this exposicion plain? this
takes away all inconuenie^s By this exposycion / god is not the auctor of
euylle this is a clarkly exposycyon / Breuely This must needs be the true
exposycyon. wherefor it were better for you / to err with. S Hierom / and with
Origin than for to say true with these new herytykis / so call you all them /
that will reprove your oldde blyndnes.

Now have you well defendyd the matter. Now is your cause well proved / Now
must the holy ghost change his words / for he has new scole masters / and
where he was wont to say / I have hardened Pharos heart Now must he say /
Pharo has hardenyd him self / by my softness and by my easynes / but I
have not done it / But yet I pray you / My goodlye masters how would you
satisfyse a weke consyens that styckis fast to the word of god and reknythe
yt ye holy ghost / knows well what he shall speak and will speak nothing with
out a great cause / but yt that he speaks shall be so well spoken yt you ca^
not a mend yt / How think you? is yt sufficyent to say to this poor man /
Orygen and. S. Hiero^ say so / hold thou thy piece / be thou co^te^t with
their exposycio^s / search thou no forther yt does not be come the to know it
but now will he lay to your charge / That this thing is openly written in
scripture / and the wordis of Moses and of paul be plain therefore you must
answer to them / and yt shall be as lawful for him too know the mind of holy
scripture as the exposicion of. S. Hierom or of Orygen. Scripture says
plainly / That god does indurate pharos heart / and not pharo his own heart It
is a new gramer to say / I will indurate pharos heart / that shall be as much /
as pharo shall indurate himself through my sofftenesse and pacie^s / by this
rule shall Anaxagoras phylosophye come in place / that shall make of every
thing what we will And where as scripture says / Saull / Saull / why doste
thou persecute me / Shall be as much to say / As why suffer thou me to be
perse quutid / Also the father of heaven / sent his wonly sone in too the world
/ shall be as much to say as he suffered his sone to be sent / So that we
shall expound all placys of scripture / too our own purposse / and not to
look what is the sentens off holy scripture nor yet what the mind off the holy
ghost is / but what exposycyon will plese us best / and what will best serve /
to our carnal mind. Forther more if god do hardyn men's hartys when he
suffers / and when he is soft and shewythe mercy / tha^ did he hardyn the
hartys of the Iuys when he brought them out of Egypt in too wyldernes / than
did he hardyn them / when he brought them out off the captiuyte of babylon /
than hardenythe he all the world whom he suffers in great softness / and
mercy / Also after your exposycion / he was mercyfulle to Israel when he sent
them in too babylon / for there did be chastyn them and by afflyccyons prouokyd
them to repentance / Likewise ye father of heaven had no mercy on the world /
when he sent his sone / for of that he gave men an occassyon off induracyon /
But when he dammy the sinners / than by your rule has he mercy on them / for
he chastises and ponysheth them for their sins this is your rule off
induracio^ / and no man may say agenst yt / but yt Misereri may not sygnyfye to
give grace / nor to remytt sin / but to chastis and to scorge / and by pains
prouok to repe^tau^ce / and Indurare / shall not signify to hardin / but to
suffer and to be pacient and to be merciful / and not to chastys. But you
subtylle Masters / how was god merciful un to pharo / by sofftenesse and by
suffera^ce who^ he chastysyd so sore / with ten plages / and with such plagys
as Moses meruelyd of / Call you that softenes? was yt sufferynge of pharo was
yt an occasyon of Induracio^ / by pacie^s / Esines and by sufferau^ce? God send
his adversaries of yt pacyens / and of yt sufferance / I pray you how could
god chastise him more and yet at every plage he says I will indurate pharos
heart wherefore pharo had none occasion of induracio^ by suffera^ce and pacie^s of
god but rather by his scorging / wherefor here must be an other sense in these
wordis tha^ you do make / and we must seek out an other wais to know how god
does work induracio^ in men's hearts (such wordis do the holy ghost use
therefore dare we speak them) And how he is the doar both of good and evil and
yet all thing yt he does is well done.

First you must nedys grant / that after the faule of Adam / the puer nature
of man was corruptyd by sin / where by / we be all wicked / and borne (as
Paul says) by nature the chylderne of wrath / and as dauyd says we are
all conceived in sin / Not withsto^ding of this corruptyd nature / does god
make all me^ both good and bad / Those yt be good / be good by his grace /
those that be bad / be bad of corruptid nature and yet god has mad the^ Never
the less by nature they are of ye same goodness and no better than nature is /
yt is to say evil / but yet ye creacio^ of god and his workema^ship is good
though yt thing be evil in it self / yet is godis work a for him self good
though al ye world say yt nay / now god of his infinite power does rule and gyde
all manner of men both good and bade / and all men by his infynyte power are
moved un to operacions / but every man after his nature / As after your own
Philosophy / Primu^ mobile / by the reason of his swyfte ^ mocion caryeth all ye
inferyor thyngis with him / and sufferth nothing to be un moved / not with
stondynge he mouythe all their own natural coursse / So likewise god of his
infynite power lets nothing to be exemtyd from him but all thyngys to be
subject un to his accyon and nothing can be done by them / but by his
pryncypalle mosyon so that he works in all manner of things both good and
bade / not changyng their nature moving the^ alonly to work after their
nature: so ye good works good and ye evil works evil and god vsithe the^
both as instrume^tis and yet does he nothing evil but evil be done allonly
through the evyl man / god workyng by him as by an instrume^te: take an exampel
A man does saw a bloke with and evil saw / The which is nothing apt for to
cut well / and yet must yt nedis cut at the mouyng of the man though it be
never so evil for the man in moving does not change the nature of the saw
never the less the accion of the man is good and co^ningly done but the
cutting of ye saw is after his nature / solikewise god mouith these evil
i^strume^tis to workyng and suffers the^ not to be ydyll / but he cha^githe
not their nature wherefore their operacio^ is a fruit co^uenye^t for their
corruptid nature but yet there is no fault in godis moui^g. Here have you now
how god workis all thingis in all me^ both good and bad but now let us go to ye
induracio^ of the^ yt he evil: thus is it / first they be evil of nature and
can abide nothing that is good nor yet suffer any good to be done. wherefore
when god ye auctor of the goodness does any thing or says any thing un to
them / than ar they more and more / sorar and sorar contrary unto god and to
all his works / for of their nature they are so corrupted / and can not agree
to the will of god nor to any thing that is good / but when it is offered
them either in word or deed / than blaspheme they / tha^ withstonde they with
all their might with all their power than ar they provoked of their corupted
nature / to more myschyffe and more / and all ways herder and herder: as for
an example / whane the blessed word off god is preched unto them that be
wykked / to whom god has given no grace to reseue yt / thane ar they nothing
a mended / but more indurated and all ways harder and harder / and ye more the
word of god is preched the more obstinate are they / the more myschyffe
intend they / than all their studdy / than all their wysdum / than all
their labor / than all their might / tha^ all their power / than all their
craft and subtylty / than all their fryndes that they cane make in heaven and
earth / is nothing else but to oppress the word of god / ye and they
think all to lyttylle for the more yt is preched / the more they grudge and
ye wodder be they / after this manner was the heart of Pharao indurated whane
that the word of god was declared un to him by Moses / and he had no grace to
reseue yt / than the more that Moses labored in ye word / the more sturdyar
was he in withstondinge of yt and all ways harder and harder / this is also
evidently seen in the corrupt nature of man for the more a thing is for bydden
him / the more desyerth he to do yt / but what need me to goo in to Egypt too
fetch an exampylle to prove this / look of our bishops / if they be not
opynly induratyd and blyndyd / and so blyndyd that no man is abyle too defend
them by any reason or law / and therefore they take them self to violence /
and oppression as pharo did which be the right signs and tokyngis of
induracyon / for the more the word of god is preched and the veryte is
declared un too them the more sturdyar and obstynat be they agenste yt / and
all their studdy / all their wyttys / all their counsellys / all their craft
and myschefe / with all glosyngis and lyinge / and with blaspheminge of god and
his prechers / is nothing else / but to keep the word of god under / and to
with stand that veryte / which they know in their consyens must nedys goo
forth / though all ye world would say nay / And therefore will they here no man
/ nor reason with any man / but even say as pharo did / I will not let the
popylle goo / but if they were not induratyd / and the very enimys un to ye
verite they would at ye lest ways here their pour brothern of cherite and know
what they could say / and if they could prove their sayng to be true / than
if they had the love of the veryte as they have but the shadow / they would
give Immortal thankis to god and with great mekenes and with a low spret
reseue the heavenly veryte and thank their brethern heartily / that they warnyd
them of such a damnable way now in good time and seson / but they have no
love too the veryte nor yet fere off god nor regard too the danger off their
soul / For they be chyldern off induracy on and off blasphemy / and there fore
the more yt is preched the more are they obstynate This is the very induracyon
that god works in men's hearts where bye they be the chyldern of darkness

to say yt there be sertyn secrettes in them that belong not for lay men to
know / And yt this thing shall not be denyde (for I know they be slyber yt I
have to do with and there is no hold of the^) therefore will I recyte an opyn
Act that all the world does remember

My lord of london Opynly at paulis cross was not a shamid with intolerable
blasphemys to condemn the holy testament of christ Jesus having for him / but
a damnable color and a dedly reason of the devyl / That was how there were in
the transelacyon so meny heresys yt all the world knows that it was
abhomynable and a dedly lie / though it were a lordly lie / but such
probacions does god all ways let the^ have / yt be agenst his holy verite /
but let us grant yt that translacion was so false / why did not you there take
a pone you opynly for to amend it and to set forth truly ye holy testament of
christ. you must needs grant that there is an holy testament of his in earth
(except you will deny christ as I dought not but that you will in effect)
where is it? why have we it not? If that were not it / why do not you set the
very true testament out / you were reddy to condemn an other man's faithefulle
labor and diligence / but you had no cheryte to amend it / you think all ways
to disseue the world with your holy hypocrysy / men be not so blind but that
they cane well Judge / If you hade condemnyd that testament allonly by cause
off errors / yet at the lest ways you should both of cheryte / and also of
duty have set forth the true text / and than would men have thought / that
you condemned the other by the reso^ of errors. But men may now euydently se
yt you did not condemn it for errors sakes / (for how should they judge
erroures that be so vnlernyd) but alonly by cause that the verite was there in
/ the which you could not abide that men should know / and that did ye
process of your sermon and also your tyranny yt does follow well prove / but
mi lord I say to you / and to all youres if you do not amend it shall be to
your everlasting damnacyon / for god will not take this rebuke at your hand
/ Esa. 62.
remember that he has sworn (by the movght of his prophet) hy his right
hand and by the might of his strength that he will defend this cause / Be
not these lordly words / of ye eternalle god / think you to make him for
sworn? Heb. 10.
Remember how the holygost thretyneth you in another place saying / if a man
did dysspysse ye law of Moses / he must with out any mercy dye / how much
more are they worthy of ponishement / that do trede the sone of God underneath
their fete / and dyspise the blood of his testament / how think you is not
this opynly agenst you / That condemn not alonly christ but also his blessed
word / and all that longythe to him / Take a way christ's word / and what
remanythe by hynd of christ? nothing at all. I pray you my lord to whom was
this word first preched? to whom was it writtyn? allonly to prystes and not
un to lay men? ye was it not writtyn to all the world? yes truly / where by
will you convert a turk or an infidelle / not by holy scripture? when they
be converted / what will you learn the^? what will you give them to read /
any other thing than holy scripture? I think nay. Now will you make your
own cu^trymen / your own citysins your own subjects ye your own
brethern / redeemed with christ's blessed blood worsse them Iuys / and
infidelles? But their is no reason nor no bretherhod / nor no christen cheryte
that cane move you / or that cane help you / for you are so blinded and so
obstinate agenste christ / that you had rather all the world should peryshe /
thane his doctrine should be brought to light / but I do promise you / if god
do spare me lyffe / and give me grace / I shall so set it out / if you do not
revoke it that it shall be to your utter s^ame and confusyon / find ye best
remedy that you cane / I do believe steadfastly / that god is myghttyar than you
/ and I do rekkyn and faytheffully believe / yt you are ten tymys worsse thane
the grette Turk for he regards no more / But rule and dominyon in this world
And you are not there with content / but you will also rule over men's consyens
ye and oppress christ and his holy word / and blaspheme and condemn his
word / was it not a holy covnselle / of the chanseler of london to conselle a
sertyn mercha^t / to by Robyn hoode for his servants to read? what should they
do with vitas patry^ / and with books of holy scriptur? Also the same Chanseler
said to an other man / what fyndest thou in the gospel but a story? what good
can thou take there out?

O lord god where art thou why slepist thou? why sufferst thou this
blasphemy? Thou have defended thy prophets with wild fire from heaven / And
will thou suffer thy wonly sone and thy heuynly word / thus to be dyspysyd?
and to be rekenyd but as a story of Robyn hoode? Rysse vpe good loorde / Rysse
vpe / thy enemies do preuaylle / Thy enymys do multiplye / show thy power /
defend thy glory It is thy con^umely and not ours? what have we to do with it
but alonly to thy glory? venge this cause or thy enymys shall rekkyn yt not to
be thy cause / O thou eternalle God though our sins have deseruyd this / yet
look on thy name / yet look on thy veryte / Se how thou art mockkyd? Se how
thou art blasphemid / ye and that by them / that have takyn on the^ to defend
thy glory / But now heuynly father / Seeing that thou haste / so suffered it /
yet for the glory of thy name / give some man strength to defend it / or else
shall thou be clearly takyn out of the hearts off allemen. where fore most
gracious lord / of thy mercy and grace I beseech the / That I may have the
strength to defend thy godly word to thy glory and honor / and to the utter
confusyon of thy mortalle enymys / help good lord help / and I shall not
fere a thousand of thine enymys / In thy name will I begin to defend this
cause. First commyth thy faythfulle servant Moses / true and Just in all thy
works / and he commandythe faythefully and trewly / and with grett thretnynges
that man / woman and child should dilygently read thy holy word / Sayng / Set
your hearts on all my words the which that I do testyfye un to you this day
/ That you may comma^de them un to yovre chyldern / to keep / to do / and to
fulfylle all things that be wryttyn in the book of this law / Mark how he
commanded them / to learn their chyldern all things that be wryttyn in this
book / Deu. 32.
and so to learn them that they might keep and fulfylle all things that were
wryttyn in the book / Moses ma^e nothing of secretnes / and will you make
secrets there in? how shall men fulfille those words that they know not? how
cane men know the very trewway of god and have not the word of god is not all
our knowledge there in? The prophet says / thy word is a lantern un to my
fete and a light unto my pathys / he calls yt a lantern and light ye and
that unto all men / Psalm. 118.
and you call yt but a story / darkness / and a thing of secretnes ye and
occasion of heresy? how cane ye occasion of darkness give light? how cane a
lantern be a thing of secretnes / how cane ye veryte of god be occasyon of
heresy? Psalm. 1
the holy prophet says / blessed is the man that sets his delectacion in
the will of god / and his meditacio^ in gods law night and day / here says
ye spret of god / that men be blessed / that studdy ye word of god / and you
say that men be heretykes for studdying of yt / how does the sprett of god
and you agree? Also. Ephe. 6
s. Paul commands us to reseue the helmytt of health / and the sword of
the sprett / the which is the word of god / I pray you to whom does he here
speak? to prystes wonly? how meny of your prystes did he know? ye was not
this pystylle written to the wholle church of the Ephesians? And did not they
read yt? were not they lay men / and why shall not our lay men read that they
red? Moreover does not Paul call yt the sword of the sprett / is it not
lawfulle for lay men to have the sprett of god? Or is the spret of god not fre
but bound alonly to you? Also. S. Johan says / yff any man come to you and
bring not this doctrine reseue him not in to your housse nor yet salute him /
here the holy ghost would we should have no another doctrine / but holy scriptur
/ and you will take yt alonly from us. Forthermore this was written un to a
woman and to her chylderne and you will that another man / wife nor child
shall read yt / but yff we should reseue your prystes in to our housys /
after this rule / I think we should not be greatly combered with them / for
there are few of them that have this word / also our Master Christ says
unto the pharesys / search you scripturs for in them you think you have
eternalle lyffe / our Master sent the pharisees to scripturs and you for bid
christian men to read the^ / who had a worsse sprete thane they / and yet they
judged better off holy scripturs than you do / for they judged to have lyffe in
them and you judge to have heresys in them so that you be tentymys worsse to
scripturs / ^. Tim. 3
tha^ ever were they. Also Paul says all scripture given by inspiracion of
god is profitable to teache to i^proue / to inform / to instruct in ryghttusnes
/ that the man of god may be perfyte / and prepared unto all good works / you
will not deny but scriptur is given us of god? ergo after. S. Paul yt is
profitable to learn with and you say yt is damnable and good to learn heresys
with. S. Paul says yt is good to improve heresys / and you say yt ingenderth
heresys. S. Paul says it is good to inform / and to instruct Ryghttusnes /
and you say to in form heresys. S. Paul says that the man off god may be
perfytt by yt / and you say that the prystes alonly shall have yt / so that
you play overthwart with. S. Paul in all things. Also. S. Paul says / you
may all interpretate sc^iptur / one by one / that all men may learn / and
all men may have comfort / but let your wyuys keep silence in the
congregation / mark how that all men may prophesy which. S. Augustine does
declare. For interpretatyng scripturs / ergo yt belong^th not allonly to
prystes / Also he says that women must hold their piece / which he need not to
command yff they were un learned. Forthermore he will that women shall learn
of their husbondes at whom / how shall their husbands learn them yff they be
unlearned them self? Also. Tim. 3.2^
s. Paul gives testimony of Timothy that he was learned in holy scripturs /
from his chyldehod / the which were abylle to instruct him un to salvation by
faith yt is in Christ Ihesu / here you not how Timothe was learned in holy
scriptures a fore he was either pressed or bishop ye being but a child? the
which as. s. Paul says / ware abyll to instruct him / and you say they be
abylle to condeme me^ is not this clean contrary agenst. S. Paul are you not a
shamed? what works shall Antichrist do more contrary to christ than these be?
let all christen men writ the deeds of Antichrist and they must all agree
in this that he shall condemn scriptur / but that shall he not do / with out
some color of right / and of holiness / and you co^deme it having no color
nor no shadow of holiness / but alonly reason of fleshelynes / and of stark
madness / think you if the great Turk would reseue such reasons as youres be
/ ye and a great delle better agenst his makomett / that he could rain so
long as he has done?

Nay doutles / and yet you look to be a lowed agenst Christ / the right sone
of god (ye and that of Christen men) which could not be hard agenst makomytte.

Mar. vlt. Mat. vlt.
Also our Master Christ commands his apostles that they should preche the
gospel un to all creaturs / and as Matthew says / that they should teache men
to keep all manner of thing yt he had commanded them / Mark that the gospelle
/ must be preached to all manner of men not to prystes wonly / the appostles
must also learn men to keep all things of the gospelle which they can not do
with out they know the^ / now yff these things that the appostles did learn
should engender or be any occasion of heresys / than the holy appostles were
occasion by their doctrine of heresys / ye and that at the comma^^ement of
our master Christ / what need the appostles to learn us any thing that might
be occasion of heresy? were we not in heresy a fore they came? were we not all
disposed of our nature unto all manner of myschyffe / and yet after your
learning they come and learn that thing that is occasion of heresy / but of
your consie^s are you not a shamed / thus damnablye / to blaspheme the heuynly
word of god thus shamfully to condemn gods word? thus presumtuously to
vndertrede the gift of the holy ghost ye and that under the pretense of
holiness / and of christendom / as though you did fauore Christ / will you make
Christ an auctor of heresy? and that under the name of holiness / will you by
your holiness / and your damnable hypocrisy / condemn our Master Christ /
the auctor of all goodness? But breuely if you would teache nothing / but that
that our master christ has left to be taught / we should not have so meny
heretics as we have / for now men be none heretics for speaking agenst
scripture (for you grant that me^ speak scripture) but for speaking against
your law / for that cause be they made heretykes / and by that be they prouyd
heretykys / now let every christen man Judge in his consyens if this be right
or lawful Is not this a meruelus thing / let a man live in fornycacyon / in
whordum / in theft / in murder / drunkonshyp in extorcyon / in brybery /
breuely in all manner of myschyffe / and you will have nothing too do with them
/ you will scaselye repreue him / ye he shall be a great officer under nethe
you and greatly in your favor / But let a man come and preach the very true
gospel of Christ and there by reprove your damnable living / and tha^
begyneth he to be an heretyke and yt shall cost you great labor if you make
him not an heretyke in deed / And yet have you nothing that you can reprove in
him as consernynge his living / But alonly that he prethithe the gospelle / Is
not this a meruelus heretyke? whose living you must needs grant to be good /
And also you can not prove / but that his lernyng is of Christ / but allonly
that yt plesythe you not / no you dare not take in hond to prove yt false / but
allonly by vyolynce you will condemn yt / Think you that god will thus
suffer? remenber what he says by the holy prophet / Thou have repreuyd ye
unfaithful peopylle / Psalm. 9.
and have distroyd the wykkyd / and takyn a way their ^ame for ever / The lord
has preparyd his troune of Judgment / Doubt you not but he shall shortly
reprove you / his Troune is set / and to the Judgment must you come where you
shall never be able to defend this cause / but you must peryshe for ever But
here will you say that you preche the gospel to the peopylle / and that is
enough for they need not to have yt in ynglyshe I answer I pray you wha^ was
there any law that ever men were bound to keep / but that yt was given them in
writing / I will not say that you do not teache the^ the right gospel / for
you know it not / But how are they able to bear away that thing yt they do but
here / And if they may here it of you why may they not also read it? But look
on. S. Luke that wrotte his gospel that men might know / for a certain those
thingis yt they were in formyd of. Moreover why did the apostle write / ye and
yt unto lay men / seeing that they were so dyligent in preching I dare boldly
say as you be? But let us see how lay men were for biddyn to read holy
scripture in the apostyllis time? Acto. 17.
The nobelyst of thessalonia / which reseuyd the word serchyd the scryptours
daily whether those thingis that Paul preached were so or not / here have you
plain yt lay men serchyd scriptours too know whither paulys doctrine were true
or not / and also how they read daily scriptours / And now come you and say
that lay men shall read no scriptours but allonly reseue them of your
prechynge / what if you preche lies (As yt will be prouyd too your face yt you
do) shall it not be lawfulle for them to search scryptours / but to learn your
lies?

Here will I resyte how a great prelatt of christys church (the first letter of
his name is Doctor Allen) did interpretate and declare sertyn placys of
scryptour / Doctuor Ale^ expounds scripture.
to the gostely instruccyon of Chrystys church as all men may Judge

The fyrft place was this A three fold cable is hard to break / by this
threfolde cabylle / he understood / the Reverent father in god my lord
Cardynalle / The first fould was / That he was an ynglyshe man borne / the
which was a strong thing and hard to with stand / The second foulde was
that he was legate and that not after the commen manner / but legatus a latere /
that is spronge out of the blyssyd side if our holy father the pope / This
wasse a strong foulde and could not be lightly brokyn. The third foulde / he
was a lord and that of the kingis counsel / This was a strong foulde / and
all these three to gether did make so strong a cable that no man with in the
realm might break yt or wythstonde yt. I was sore a frayd that he should have
reknyd the nobylle and the Ryalle blood that this threfolde cable did spryng
out off / than had yt been so strong / that the strongyst Ox in the buchers
stalle could not break it. This exposycyon did I here and satt by him therefore
I can testyfye it the better.

The Second scripture was this from syon shall come out a law / and the
word off god from Jerusalem / This did he expound on this manner / The
commandment of the most reverent father in god lord Legatte / is Come from
his hye palys / and from his noble grace hither un to you.

The thryd scripture / was this Sumite Psalmu^ et date timpanu^ / this did he
expou^de on this manner / I have done my visitacio^ / now give me my money How
think you by this holy Doctor / and this prelatte of Christ's church has he
not well declared holy scryyture / Is he not worthy too be believed? What
reason were yt that lay men should search scrypturs than might they reprove
this noble prelat what order ware that? yt were right if he we^ well served
that he had a threfolde halter too stretche him in / But by such doctors as
these be must the pour peopyll be ruled and if they will search for the veryte
them self / than must they be heretykes by cause they will not believe these
holy fathers / Act^. 18.
But let us proceed in our matter against these blasphemers of gods word
Priscilla and Aquila did expound un to Apollo which was a grett lernyd man the
perfyt understanding of scripturs / These were lay persons and yet were they so
learned in scryptours that they were able too teache a grett doctor / And now
lay men may not read scrypturs This was alowyd by petter / and paul / But
their successoures will condeme yt as heresy.

Act^. 8.
Also Enuchus that was the tresurar un to ye Queen of ye Ethiopians did read
Esaias the prophet / The which he understood not / tylle god sent him Phillip to
declare yt un to him / This was a lay man / And also an Infydell and yet was
not for biddyn of god to read scripturs But rather helped to the understanding
of the^ and now will you forbid christen men / to read holy scriptours / that
are sworn un to them ye and also to defend them un to death?

Also. Saint Paul says Let the word of god dwell in you ple^teuosly / (...)
^.3.
S. Paul would that lay men should learn the word of god / ye and that
plentuusly / and you command that they shall have nothing of yt. How stondeth
your nothing / with. Saint Paul's abu^da^te Abunda^tly / and nothing / be for
a sunder / But thus do you all ways a gre with. Saint Paul and with holy
scripture / And if you would say plainly in wordis that your dedys do declare
openly / than were we in no doubt of you / for all the world would take you /
as you be takyn a fore god / yt is for the Antichristis that the world looks
for / Never the less doubt you not / but god shall declare yt openly at his
time / to your utter confvsyon and damnacyo^ / for doughtles you neither hold
with Christ with holy doctors / not yet with your own law / where they be
agenste you / but all these must be expoundyd and wrong un to your carnalle
purposse or else you make yt heresy / But think you that the father of heuyn
(which for the grett tender love / that he had to man's soul sent his wonly
sone to redeem yt / and also to give yt a law to live by out of his own
mougth) shall thus suffer yt to be lost through your hypocrysy / and his godly
word to be over tredyn for the mayntaynynge of your worldly Glory? nay
douteles for if yt were possybylle / that he could moore regard your pomp
and pride than man's solle and his godly word / yet were yt impossible that
ever he should so dyspysse / the swet blood of his blyssyd sone swet Jesus /
where fore look a pon your charge.

But to our purpose / Augu. a^ fratres. s 38.
S. Augustine is openly agenst you in these wordys. My brothern read holy
scripture in the which you shall find what you ought to hold / and what you
ought to fly / what is a man reputyd with out learning? what is he? Is he not
a sheep or a got? Is he not an Ox or an Ass? Is he any better than an
horse or a mule the which has no understanding. etc^.

Here S. Augustyn movythe men to read holy scripture And you comma^de them not
to read it S. Augustine says They shall know in them what to do / and what not
to do / and you say they shall learn nothing there out but he resys. S.
Augustyn says a man with out lernyng of scripturs / is no better than a brute
best / are not you god fathers that will make all your chyldern no better
tha^ bestes / Also Athanasyus. In ep^s. ad Ephe. c. 6.
If thou will that thy chylderne shall be obedient un to the / vsse them to
the words of god But thou shall not say that it belongyth alonly to religious
men to studdy scripturs / but rather it belongythe to every christen man and
specially un to him / that is wrappyd in ye busynessis of this world / and so
much the more / by cause he has more need of help for he is wrapped in the
trubbilles of the world / therefore it is greatly to thy profit that thy
chyldern should both here and also read holy scripturs / for of them shall
they learn this commandyment / honor thy father and thy mother etc

These words be plain enough agenste you / They need no exposicio^ / And the
doctoure is of auctorite wherefore answer you to him. In Genesis c. ^. ho. 28.
Also Chrisostu^ that was a byssope as well as you be / condemnythe your
sentens opynly saying. I beseech you that you will oftyntimis come hither /
and that you will diligently here the lesson of holy scriptur / and not
allonly whane you be here / But also take in your hondes whane you be at home
the godly bibles / and reseue the thing there in with grett studdy for there by
shall you have grett vantage etc^.

These words be so plain that I cane add notyng to them / would you that we
should take you for bishops and for holy fathers / yt be so opynly agenst
scripture / and so contrary to holy doctors / that will I never do whylle I
live / I never look to see other Antichrists than you / And so will I take
you tylle I se almighty god co^uerte you. Also ye same doctor says. In Mat.
c. 1. hom. 2.
Which of you all that be here / (if it were requiryd (could say won psalm
with out ye book or any other part of holy scriptur / not won doubtless But
this is not alo^ly ye worste / but that you be so slow and so remiss unto
spritualle things / and unto deuillishenes you are whottar than any fire / but
men will defend this myschiffe with this excuse / I am no religious man I have
a wife and chylderne / and a house to care for / This is the excuse where with
you do (as it were with a pestele^ce) corrupt all things for you do rekkyn
that ye studdy of holy scriptur belongythe alonly unto religius men / whane
they be much more necessary un to you than unto the^ etc^. Here may you se
that your damnable institucion was in the hearts of men in chrysostu^s days /
and how they would read no scripturs / but you se he co^demmyth it / and
callithe it a pestilens / and will you now bring it in again? If you had but a
lovsy statute of your own age^ste me or an other man / you would caulle us
heretykes / But you neither regard christ's holy word nor holy doctors nor
yet any other thing that is age^ste you. But let us se what your own law
says to this / Di. 38. Si iuxta.
If christ (as paul says) be the power and the wysdom of god / thane to be
ignorant in scrypturs / is as much as to be ygnorant of Christ. etc^. Here
have you plainly that to take away scripturs from lay men / is as much as to
take away christ from them / the which no doubt / but that you do intend in
your hearts to do / and that thing god knows and your works do declare
yt the which god shall venge full stratly over you / also in an other place /
7. sinod. c. Oe^s et. di. ^
I will set my meditacion in thy iustificacions / and I will not for get
thy words / the which thing is exidyng good for all christen men to observe
and keep. etc^. Here is a counselle of your own that has admytted that all
christen men shall studdy holy scripture. And will you now condemn yt? Is
their neither scripture of god / nor practys of christen men / nor exposycion
of doctors / nor your own law / nor yet any statute of counselles yt will
hold agenst you? you be meruelus giantes / how shall a man behave him self to
handylle with you / yt is not possible to over come you / for you will admyt^
nothing that is agenst you. But yet will I not so leave you / but I will first
declare yt manifestly / that you be contrary to christ / In prohe. In Epist.
ad Ephesians. Li. 1.
and to all holy doctors. S. Hierom / repreueth you very sore in these
words. O Paula and Eustochium / if there be any thing in this lyffe that does
preserve a wise man and does persuade him to abide with a good will in ye
oppressions and the thravlledoms of the world I do rekken that specially yt is
the meditacio^s and the studdy of holy scripture seeing that we do dyffer from
other creaturs specially in that that we be reasonable and in that that we cane
speak / now is reason and all manner of words contained in godly scriptur /
where by that we may learn to know god and also the cause wherefore we be
created / wherefore I do sore marvelle / that there be certain men the which
give the^ self / to slouthefullnes / and sluggyshnes and will not learn those
things / that be good / but rekken those men worthy to be reproved / that have
that good mind. etc^. Mark how that this was written to two women / that were
learned. Also he rekneth nothing better / than to studdy holy scriptures / he
also meruelyth / that serten will neither studdy scriptures them self nor yet
let other men studdy them / It is well known / that these words prycke no
men but you / and you be so slothefulle and so given to voluptuousnes / that
you your self will not studdy scriptures nor yet suffer other me^ to studdy
the^ but if you do studdy them / it is to diffene your simple and pore
brother there by / and to maintain your abominable living / with wrestyng
and wryngynge of them: other profit comes there none of your studdy / as
all the world knows. For you may not preche / but wha^ you have damnablye
condemned christ's blessed word or else by vyolence / made some of your poor
brethern heretics / than come you with all your gorgius estate / pomp and
pride / to out face christ and your simple brother / with your outward
damnable pride a fore the face of the world / but my lords / leve of your
fasynge and your brasyng / for our lord whose cause we defend agenste you /
will at length not be out fased Remember how the holy ghost prayth agenst you
saying / judge them lord / Psalm. 5
that they may fall from their cogitacions / expelle them lord for they have
provoked the / dought you not but this holy sprett will prevaylle agenste you
/ though god suffer you for a sesonne yet has he till this day defended him
self and his godly words agenst all the proud crakynges of the world / and
think you that he will now take a faulle at your hand? nay nay / he shall
first thrust you out hedlynges that all ye world shall take example by you /
this is my believe. For that word that you have condemned does thus learn me /
wherefore if you do not revoke the condemnacion of the new testament / and
ordeyne that all christen men may read holy scriptur you shall have the
grettest shame yt ever men hade in this world for you ar never abylle to
defend yt by no menys / nor by no power that is in earth / and if all power in
earth will withstonde yt / he shall rather bring the^ all to duste and
raysse up of stonys new rulars. you wormys meat / you stynkyng carrion you
nurryshement of hell fire / how dare you thus presume agenste your god
omnipotent? whether will you fly to a void his danger? heaven and earth /
watter and fire / sone / moan / and starrys / saynctes and angels / man and
child / be agenst you and hold you a cursed. what though ye deuylle laffe on
you for a seson / Remem^er the end / but god give you his grace / that I loss
not my labor a boute you.

But now let me a soylle your carnalle reasons that you bring for you. The
first is this evil men do take an occasion of heresy out of scripturs /
wherefore yt is best they have yt not / I answer like wife good men do take
an occasion of goodness there of ergo ye people ought to have yt / but will you
condemn all things where by men do take occasion of evylle? Than must you
first put out your own yies for by them take you occasyon to see meny idylle
things: you must also dystroy your hondes your fette your tongue / and all
that you have for these do you mysse use very often / you must also distroy
your own hearts whereby you have not alonlye occasion of evylle / but you do
think evylle in very deed / you must also destroy all fair women / for of
them take you sore occasions of evylle / you must also burn all your goods
and destroy all your richys / for of them me^ take occasion to be theuys and
you to be proud / you must also distroye all winys / for of them men take
occasion to be drunken / you must distroy all mettes / for they give men
occasion of gluttyny / ye you must distroye the marcy of god / of the which
evylle men take boldness in their myschyffe / breuely what is there so good a
thing but that evylle men cane take an occasion of evylle / ye and that of
Christ him self / as. 1. Corin. 1.
S. Paul says which unto to the Iuys is offense / and unto the gentylles
occasion of folyshenes / and yet for all this you may not dystroye Christ /
but he must remain stylle and so like wise ye gospelles / for though yt the
evylle man (which will never be good) reseue of it occasion of evyll / yet there
be meny thousands yt reseue there by their salvation. Now be cause ye spyder
gethereth poison of ye good herbis / it were no reason therefore to dystroy all
good herbys. Mar. 1^
A another of your reasons / there be serte^ sentences in scripture yt do not
belo^ge for everye man to know / as our. M. Christ faith / unto you is it
given to know / ye mysterys of ye kingdom of heaven / unto the^ is it not given
I a^swere whom mean you wha^ you say / unto you it is given / if you mean ye
aposles and alonly their successors tha^ may not you read holy scriptur / for
you be not the successors of the appostles / by my lord of Rochestes auctoryte
/ but yff you mean the christen people / that have the sprete of god / as our
Master Christ meant than be you excluded for you have not the sprytte of god as
the effect does declare / ergo you may not read scripturs mark also that our
Master says un to you yt is given / as who says if yt were not given you
should no more have yt thane other men.

Now how cane you prove that the understanding of scriptur is given to you?
but now to ye text our master Christ speaks here of ye sprytualle / and ye
right understanding of holy scripturs / which is the gift of god wonly / and
he speaks not of studyyng or redynge of holy scripture / for you have in yt
same place / how that meny did follow him / and hear his prechynge but yet
they understand him not / therefore this text makes derectly agenste you and
your works do declare that you be the herars and reders of the word of god
but the understanding is not given you. But now will my lord of Rochester say
/ that you have ye very understanding as holy doctors had yt / for though that
scripturs in them self and of their own nature be playnest / and best to be
known yet be ye holy doctors playnest un to us / wherefore he that will
understand scripture must first learn to understand the doctors / and they
shall bring him to the true understanding of holy scripture / or else he must
err. I answer o my lord do you write this with a saffe consyens? think you
that you cane discharge your consyens a fore the dredfulle face of Christ
with this tryflynge distynccyon / Quedam sunt nociora nobis / et queda^ nociora
natura / I pray you if you will prove that god were wise / would you be gyne to
prove yt at your wysdo^? if you would prove that god were a live would you
prove yt by that that you be a live? if you would persuade a man to believe that
there is a good / would you learn him / that he must needs believe yt / by cause
that there be creaturs? these things be best known unto you / and if you would
prove that a man has a true sens of scripturs / will you prove yt / by that
that he has ye sense of ye doctors? what if ye doctors had taken a false and
a contrary sense / this case is possible would you therefore say yt ye sense
which the man has taken out of scriptur is false? But I pray you my lord /
after this rule / how culde me^ / understand scripturs / in Peter and Paul's
days whane there were no doctors. Scotus. ^^ Sent. di. 3 q. 3
But after your own lernyng / that same sciens which must prove the
principylles of other sciences is first known / actualiter / dystynkly / now
be all the pryncipalles of all other doctors proved true by holy scriptur /
ergo there is no saying nor exposicion of holy doctoures that cane be perfytly
known except that scripture be first known / this is your own dyumyte ye
cane not deny yt / wherefore if you will prove that you have the verite you
must prove yt / by cause you have the sense of holy scriptur / and not the
sense of holy doctoures but douteles I have great mervelle / that my lord of
Rochester / is neither ashamed of man / nor yet afraid of the vengeance of god
that thus tryfylythe with holy scripture.

Besides this you have an other baulde reason / the City of London has
serten previleges and secret counsels / yt were no reason that all men should
know them / this was my lord of Londons reason at Paulys cross / whane he
condemned the new testament. I Answer my lord say of your conscience / did
you not speak these words to please my lord yt mayre of London and his
brethern / but I pray you is this a like symylitude of the serten counsels of
men the which must be kept secrett by cause they be counsels / And of the holy
scripturs the which were brought in to this world not to be kept secrett but
to be preched openly / as our Master Christ commands / preche the gospelle
to all creaturs / hear you to all creaturs? Mar. vlt.
let these men have yt (for all these be of the counsel) and keep you yt
from the ressydue / furthermore our Master says in a another place / that
that I have showed you in secretnes / preche yt on the tope of the housse.
Also. S. Paul says / the gospel is declared openly through prechyng and in an
other place god has brought lyffe and immortalyte / Ti. 1. 2. Timo. 2 Joan. 3
Mat. 5.
unto light through the gospelle / also our master calls yt the light of the
world / now who will set (as he says) a light under a busshell / and not
rather openly that all men there by may be lyghtened? wherefore my lord your
symylytude is very for un like / and if you were not a lord yt ware worthy
to be dyspised / but douteles yt may be well thought that you ware at a sore
exigent / when you were compelled to prove this thing with so baulde a reason
/ who would have looked for so simple a reason in so ernyst a matter of so wise
a man / of so great a doctor / of so worshypfulle a father / and of the
bishop of London / ye and of him that is called a another Solomon / nor
withsto^dinge such an haltyng symilytude did he never learn in the proverbs
of Solomon / but yt had been a better symylytude / of the kings proclamacio^ /
which is proclaimed yt all me^ might know yt and also keep yt and no man is
bound to keep yt / tylle yt be proclaimed / like wysse the gospelle was given
for to be proclaimed / and everye man is bound to keep yt / wherefore yt must
needs be proclaimed to everye man / and un to you my lord I be seche god that
you may be won of them of whom yt is spoken. To you is yt given to know the
mysteryes of god. Amen.

Finis
Men's constitucions which be not grounded in scripture bind not the conscience
of man under the pain of dedly sin.
TO this article we must note yt there be two manner of mynysters or powers: won
is a temporalle power / the other is called a spritualle power / the temporalle
power is committed of god to kings / Dukes / Erlys / Lords / Barrons / Judges
/ mayrys / shryuys / and to all other mynystres under them / these be they
that have wonly the temporalle sword / where by they must order all the
commen welthe with all wordly things longing there unto / as the disposicio^
of these wordly goods / who shall be right owner and who not / the probacion of
men's testimentes / the orderyng of paymentes and custo^s the setting of all
manner of taskes and forfyttes / the correccion of all transgressions / where
by the commen welthe / or any private person / is dysquieted or wronged / as
correccion of Theuys / murderars / harlottes baudes / sclanderars wranglars /
extorcioners / brybers / vserars / false byars and sellars / and of all other
things where unto be longs any outward orderinge or any corporalle pain /
in this power is the king cheffe and fulle ruler / all other be minysters and
servants as. S. Paul does declare saying / let every soulle be subject and
obedient unto the hye powers. etc^.

Roma. 13. 1. Pet. 2.
Also. S. Peter / be subject un to the king as un to the cheffe head / either
un to rulers as un to them that are sent of the king for the ponyshement of
euylle doars. Roma. 13
Un to this power must we be obedye^t in all things that perteyne to the
minystracion of this present lyffe and of the commen welthe / not allonly (as
paul says) for a voydyng of ponisheme^t but also for dischargynge of our
conscience / for this is the will of god. So that if this power co^ma^de any
thing of tyranny agenste right and law (All ways provided that it repugne not
agenst the gospel nor distroye our faith) our cherite must nedis suffer yt /
for as paul says / 1 Cor. 13 Mat. 6.
Cherite sufferth all thing / Also our Master christ / if a man stryke the on
the won cheke / turn him ye other / for he does exarcisse tira^ny / but over
these worldly goodis / and these present thingis and over thy corporal boddy /
which Christian men do not alonly not regard but they dispisse it / Never ye
less if he co^mande yt any thing against right or do ye any wrong (As for an
example cast ye in preson wrongfully) if thou canste by o^ny reasonable and
quiet menys / with out fedyssion / in surreccion / or breking of the co^me^
peace save they self or avoid his tira^ny thou may do it with good conscience
/ As if thou were in presonne if thou could a void with out any sedisio^
thou may lawfully do it / and thy conscience is fre so doing and thou do
not sin / nor offend the law of god / as paulle says / 1. Cor. 7.
If thou may be fre vsse yt / but in no wysse (be yt right or wrong) may
thou make any resistance / with sword or with hand but obey except thou
canste a void as I have showed the / but if the cause be right / lawful / or
prophitable to the commen wealth / thou must obey / and thou may not fly with
out sin / That men have fled from the tyranny and ye wrong of this power we
have yt openly / 4. Reg. 6. 3. Reg. 19. Act. ^. ide^. 9. and.14
in diverse placis of scriptours / As of Elezy that fled from the tyranny of ye
king of Siria / Also Helyas fled from the tyranny of king ^ has / also Saint
Peter fled out of presonne / And. S. Paul^e out of the City of damascum / and
out of Iconyu^ as it is open in the Actis of the apostyllis / so yt agenst this
power (though thou have wrong) may thou not make any corporal resistaunce /
but allonly a void by flyynge / or else keep ye thing that is co^mandyd the.
But if it be right / and to the prophyt of the co^me^ welthe / thou must both
fulfylle it and also abide.

But now will there be inquierid of me / this casse / if it please the kyngis
grace to co^ve^ine the New testament in ynglyshe and to command yt none of his
subiectis shall have it under his displesure whether they be bound to obey this
commandment or no? to this will I answer / That I do believe / yt our most
noble prince has not^ forbyddyn / that christen me^ may have chrystis
testament whether yt be in lattyn / in ynglyshe / french / douche / grek / or
Ebrew / for christ's veryte / is all whom in all tongis / And as his grace
knowyth yt were very unreasonable that any man should either counsel / or for bid
his grace that he should know or read / the testament off the Most noble
prince his father in the which is allonly given / and ^misyd worldly goods /
which as soon as they be given / be reddy to dekey and to perysh / and if (I
say) this be unreasonable / and unright / how much more were yt unreasonable to
take away from us our father of heuyns testament. whosse legasy and promysys
do as for excelle / ye legasys of the noble prince his father / as god does
excelle man. But what should I make meny resons to prove un to his grace that
thing to be lawfulle / That the father of heaven has sent us / from whom
commythe nothing but goodness / ye and it was not sent by man / by Angel / or
by saint / but by the wonly sone of god / both god and man / and dylygently
declared by him to all the world / Not un to the Pharysys alone / but un to
all manner of people / and that to the hour of his death / and also there of
took his death / and not yet so content / but sent his glorious apostillis to
declare and to learn this godly word through all the world. And by cause the
mynystracyon of this word requyered a greter strength than was in any natural
man / therefore also gave he them his eternalle spret / to stablyshe the^ / to
confirm them / and to make them strong in all thingys that there might be
nothing desyeryd / too the declaracion and setting out of this word.

Now who could find in his heart / That is a true subject and regardythe the
honor of our noble prince and the salvation of his soul / either to think
that his grace would condemn yt / or else to move him to condemn ye thing /
that commythe from heuyn ye and that from the father of heaven / and sent and
learned by his eternal sone which has selyd yt with is most precius blood /
and ^o commandyd his glorious apostillis to preche yt / And confirmed it with
so meny mirakylles and did also give / to the confirmynge and the writing of
yt / The glorious consolatour the holy ghost / so that yt is open / yt the
father of heaven did not send this godly word with a small diligence / or as
though he caryd not whyther yt should remain in earth or not / But so has he
declared this holy word with such a prosses / That heuyn / earth and hell
should know that yt is his word / and yt yt is his will that all men should
have yt / and that he would defend it / and be enymy un to all them that would
ouerpresse it. wherefore let the^ yt be cappitall enymys un to his grace both
in heart and in deed susspect that of his grace and move him unto it / for
doutles I will never do it for I dare boldly say / That the devil of hell
which is enymy un to his grace / both of body and soul will move him un to no
another thing but allonly so to condemn gods word / and This thing does his
grace know well / and therefore I dought not but that he has and also will a
void the danger theroff. Never the less yt may pleasse god to take so great
vengeance for our abominable sins that after his gracis days / he may send
us such a tyra^t / That shall not allonly for bid the New testament / but also
all things that may be to the honor of god ye and that peraduentur under
such a color of gods name / That all men shall rekkyn none other but that
he is gods friend.

This will be a great scorge / and an intolerable plage / the father off heuyn
off his infynyte mercy defend us from such a terryble vengeance: Roma. 1.
for yt is the grettyst plage that can come in earth (as. Saint Paul does
declare to the Romans) when that godis veryte is condemnyd in godys name and
men be so blind that they can not perseue yt / for they be geuyn in to a
perverse sens / this plage never co^mith / but yt is a tokyn off everlasting
reprobacion / our most marcifulle redemer Christ Jesus / defend us from ^t
amen. But if it come that we must needs suffer this plage / how shall christen
men vsse the^ self to this Prince that will so condemn gods word? My
lords ye bisshops would deposse him with short deliberacion / and make no
consyens of it / They have deposyd princes for lesser causys than this is a
gretdell. But against them will I all ways lay Christ's fact / and his holy
Apostles / and the word of god / whom christen men must alonly follow /
Therefore the kings commandiment must be consyderid on this manner / if the
king forbid The new testament / Or any of christ's sacraments / Or the
prechyng of the word of god or any other thing that is agenst christ under a
temporalle pain / Or else under ye pain of death: me^ shall first make
faithefulle prayers to god / and then diligent intercession un to the kings
grace with all due subieccio^ / That his grace would relese that commandime^t.
If he will not do it / They shall keep their testament with all other
ordinance of christ / and let the king exercysse his tyranny (if they can not
fly) and in no wisse under the pain of damnacio^ shall they withstonde him
with violence but suffer patiently all the tyranny that he layth on the^ both
in their boddys and goods / and leave the ve^gance of it un to their heuynly
father which has a scorge to tame those bedlams with whane he seyth his time.
But in no wisse shall they resyste violentlye / nor they shall nor deny
christ's verite / nor yet for sake it a fore ye prince les^ they ru^ne in the
danger of these words / he yt denyithe me and mi word a fore men / I shall
deny him a fore my father in heuyn / And let not men regard this matter
lightly and think that they may give up their testamentes and yet not deny
christ / for what so ever he be that geuithe up his testament as a thing worthy
to be condemnyd / he does a fore god deny christ / Though his testament be
peradventure (he not knowing) false and un truly princyd / or untruly
transelatyd / yet unto him is it a true testament / and therefore shall he not
deliver it to any that will condemn it as vnlawfulle. But this shall he do /
If any man that is lernyd do find any taute there in he shall be glade to a
mend that fault / but not to suffer in any wysse for that or for those fautes
the holle testament to be condemned as vnlawfulle. for if that should be
sufferd / than should we have no testament for there is no testament that is so
true / but either there be fautes in deed / orels me^ by cauylacyons may invent
that there be fautes / for this dare I say boldly / That the new testament in
ynglyshe is tentymys truar / thane the oolde translacyon in lattyn is / in the
which be meny places yt do want whole sentensys / 1. Cor. 15. Mat. 20. Act. 20.
1. Tim. 6.
and meny places / that no man cane defend with out heresy / as this text /
Non omnes immutabimur / Also this / Sedere ad dexteram meam vel sinistram non
est meu^ dare vobis / Also these places want / Commorati sumus trogilij /
Seiungere ab is qui huiusmodi sunt / with meny other places more / that noman
can say but they be euydently false / and yet we may not burn our books for
all that / but keep them and a mend the^ Nor they shall not goo a bought / to
deposse their prince / as mi lords ye bishops were wont to do / but they
shall boldly confess / yt they have ye verite and will there by abide / and
alo^ly shall they pray to their heuynly father to change ye heart of their
prince / yt they may live underneath him / after christ's word / and in quietness
as paul exhortithe us saying / 1. Tym. 1.
I exhort that prayers supplicacio^s / peticions and geuyng off thanks / be
had for all men / for kings and for all yt are in prehemine^s yt we may lyve
a quiet and a pesable lyffe in all goodness and honesty Thus shall men be have
the^ self toward their prince and in no wisse shall they deny christ's
word / or grant to ye burning of their testame^tes / but if ye king will
do it by violence they mvst suffer it / but not obey to it by a greme^t / This
may be prouyd by ye examples of the apostles wha^ ye hye prystes of ye temple
co^ma^dyd Peter and Johan / Act. 4. and. 5
yt they should no more preche and teache in ye name of Jesus / But they made
them answer it was more right to obey god tha^ man. Also ye pharisys came and
commanded our master Christ / in herodes name / That he should depart from
thens / or he would kylle him / but he would not obey but made them answer to
Herod with a great thretnyng / Go tell ye wolf / be hold I cast out deuylles
and I make men holle this day and to morrow / Luce. 13.
And ye thryd day am I consumed / never the less I must continue this day to
morrow and the next day etc^. So yt he left not ye ministracio^ of ye word
/ nether for ye kings plesur nor yet for fere of death. Also we have opynly /
Dani. 3.
that ye three chyldern would not obey to ye co^mandiment of king nabuchodonosor
/ by cause it was against ye word of God / likewise we have an example / where
as ye king darius commandyd yt no man should axe any peticyo^ / Danie. 6.
either of god or man with in ye space of xxx. days but of him only / Not with
stondynge Daniell went in to his house / and thryse in a day made his prayers
to god of Jerusalem / for the which thing he was put in to the den of liones
/ ye which he did obey as in suffering of the pain but not in consentyng to
the unright commandment / So that Christen men are bound to obey in sufferyng
the kings tyranny / but not inconsentyng to his un lawfulle commandiment /
all ways having a fore their yies / Mat. 10.
the confortable sayng of our M. christ Fere not them that kylle ye boddy /
which wha^ they have done they cane no more do / 1. Pet. 3.
Also S Petter / happy are ye if you suffer for ryghttusnes sake / never the
less fere not / though they seem terebille un to you neither be trublyd but
sanctify the lord god in your heart. And let the^ not fere but that their
father of heuyn has care for them / And shall deliver them / And also bring
his godly word un to light wha^ yt shall please his eternalle will / age^ste
the which no tyrante is abylle to with stond But whane the tyra^tes think
them self most suer of the vyctory / and be all reddy prouydyd to burn
Susanna / Dani. 13.
tha^ shall he reyse up a danielle that shall caulle a gain the sentence of
the lecherous prystes / And when Joseph is sold in to Egypt / and there cast
in prison than will he make him lord over all Egypt ye and also over them
that sold him. Genes. 37. et. 39.
He brengeth also to pass that proud Aman be he never so grett in the kings
favor shall be hangyd on his own gallows / that he made for mardocheus the
Isralyte / Also when Pharao has commandyd under pain of death to destroy
all the men chyldern of Israel / Than cane he find the menys to save Moses ye
and that on the watter: Exodus 2.
where as all the power of Egypt could not save the king / ye and he
norryshyd him in ye kings house / at the kings cost ye and by the kings
daughter / Did pharao supposse this? or was there any counselle of Pharaos that
could preuaylle agenste this? was there any wysdom or tyranny in the earth that
was abille to extincte moses? nay verily. Furtheremore wha^ Israel has been in
egipte.iiij.C. yerys in grett captivity and thraldu^ / yet agenst Pharaos will
kepith he his promis and delivers them and makyth watter fire and earth to
serve them / and when all Israel was in despair and pharao ye tyrant was
reddy to suck blood Than showed our God his myghtty power. what can Israel
think when he has the red see a fore him / And pharao with all his might and
power after him / and of every side a grett mountain / what hope has he by
man's might / by man's power / by man's wysdom / by man's pollisy / for to be
deliueryd? none at all. But a fore Israelles carnalle yie all thing is in
extreme dysperacyon. Psalm. 2
But now you princes that Judge the earth learn and take head / here co^mith the
god of Israel / who^ all Egypt has dispysyd / skornyd mokkyd and co^demnyd
and shows his might where as nothing can help but he wonly / and where the
tyrantis rekkyn to be most suer of victordu^ / Act. 12.
there bringyth he all their malys too an end. And wha^ herod has peter in
preson fast bound in chenys / and of every side of him a sodyare and kepers
set at the preson door every man in his office watchyng that peter shall not
escape (for herod in tends the day following too bring him forth to
wonderynge and also to death) Than agenst herodis will / a boue all his might a
boue all his wysdum and polycy / notwythstondinge all the sodyar^s and
gaolars of the preson / comes the power of our eternalle god and ledeth Peter
through the first and the second ward / ye and the brason gate must wylfully
open / and let Peter out / whom our lord god would deliver. Shortly / what
should I bring meny examples to prove gods power and to declare how the
troth of god and his childerne be all ways in persecucyon / but the end is
all ways glory unto them wherefore this won example / of our Master Christ
shall be sufficient to stablish and to confirm all febylle hearts / and also
to molyfye all stonye hearts / and fynallye to confound / the violent tyranny
of mortalle tyrants which be but stubbilles keye and duste / and in a moment
be brought to a lump of stynkyng carryon / consider our master Christ which
is the very true sone of god / Mat. 27. and. 28.
and god him self and yet is he crucyfyde and put to death / as a sedicious
person / as a malefactor as a theffe / as a traytoure / ye and as an heretyke
/ he is laid also in the grave and a great stone a fore the door / and sodyars
that were not of the commen sort / but of the Romans / be set dylygently to
keep the grave with all the polycy and wysdum that the bysshopes could
devysse / and all that he should not rysse up again acordynge to his word /
but all this could not help for the power of god would not be let / his
veryte could not be proved false / his word could not be oppressed / but
whane the tyrants thought to make their tryumphe off vyctorye / than were they
most overcumme / for yt is neither watter nor fire / see nor Land / heaven nor
earth / death nor hell / that cane let god to defend his chyldern / or to
bring forth his godly word to light / and to keep his eternalle promysys /
Therefore let Christen me^ not fere to keep the word of god and fast there by
to abide / and not to deny yt for any tyranny / for the day shall come whane
it shall be greatly to their glory / And Sodom / and Gomor shall be more
easelye handlyd / than such princes / that do persecute the holy word off
God. Now is it clear made that we can not resyst this temporalle power in no
wysse by vyolence / but if we have wrong either we must do the thing that is
commanded us or else fly / but if any thing be commanded us that is agenste the
word of god where by our faith is hurt / that we should not do in any
wysse: but rather suffer persecucyon and also death. But agenst this power
goythe not our Article for it commands nothing as consernynge the consyens /
but alonly as consernyng the ordering of worldly things and there fore / it
mynistreth a temporalle pain over the boddy wonly and there with content /
wherefore we will now speak of the other power which me^ call spiritualle.

First here is to be notyd that this is no power Nor none auctorite worldly /
but al only a mynystracyon of the word of God and a spiritualle regement /
prechyng the gouernynge of the soul and the mynystracion of the sprett having
nothing to do with the exterior Iustes or ryghtwisnes of the world and therefore
has it no power by right and law to make any statutes or lawys to order the
world by / but alonly faith fully and truli to preche and to minister ye word
of god there by i^structi^g ye co^sye^s of man nothing addyng there to / nor
taking there from but as S. Paul says / 2. Tim. 3
to abide in those things that they have learned / Romans 16
and that be committed un to them / for. S. Paul (as he him self says)
durst speak no another thing but those things which Christ had wrought by
him / for he curses him be he man or angel that precheth any other gospel /
Gala. 1. Hiere. 23
than he had preched / therefore the prophet commands us that we should not
here the words of those prophets which dysseue us / for they speak visyons of
their own hearts and not out of the might of god / and yet speak they in the
name of god / wherefore these me^ so long as they speak wonly the word off god
/ so long are they to be hard / as christ him self / after that saying he
that hereth you hereth me / Luce. 10 Mat. 23. Super Ioa^. Trac. 46.
also what so ever they say un to you sitting in the chair of Moses do yt /
on the which text speaks. S. Augustine / By syttyng in the chair is
understand ye learning of ye law of god / and therefore god does teache by
the^ / but if they will teach their own doctrine hare yt not / do yt not /
for such men seek that yt is theires and not Christ's. etc^.

These words be plain agenst all them yt preche any thing but the law of
god wonly / wherefore yff these mynysters will of tyranny above the word of
god make any law or statute / yt must be considered after two manner awayes /
first whether yt be openly and derectly agenst the word of god and to the
dystruccion of the faith / as that statute is where by they have condemned the
new testament / and also forbidden serten men to preche the word of god
having no true cause agenste them / but alonly their malicius susspeccion /
also that lernyng where by they learn / that works do justify: more over that
statute where by they bynd me^ under the pain of damnacyon to be assoyled of
them / these statutes I say with other like men are not bound for to obey
nether of cherite (for here is faith hurt which gives no place to cheryte) nor
yet for a voydyng of sclander / for the word of god may not be a voydyd / nor
yet give place / un to sclander for than should yt never be preched / but it
must be fast stuck un to and the more that men be offended with all and the
styffer that they be agenste yt / the more openly and planlye ye and that to
their faces / that make such statutes must we resyst them with these words /
Act. 5.
we are more bound to obey god than man.

This is well proved / by Hylarius words / Hylarius in Matt. cano. 14.
all manner of plants that be not planted of ye father of heaven must be
plucked up by the roots / that is to say the tradicions of me^ / by whose
menys / the commandimentes of the law be broken / must be destroyed / and
therefore calls he them / blind gydes of the way to everlasting lyffe /
because they se not that thing they promys / and for that cause / he says /
that both the blind gydes and they that be led shall faule in to the dyke.
etc^. Mark that all tradicious of me^ which are agenst gods law must be
dystroyed / therefore let everye man take heed / for yt longs to their charge
/ for both the blind gydes and also they that be led shall fall in ye dyke /
yt shall be none excuse / for him that is led to say that his gyde was blind
/ but let them here the word of god by his holy prophet walk not in the
precepts of your fathers nor keep not their judgments / Ezech. ^0.
but walk in my precepts / and keep my judgments. The other manner of
statutes be when serten things that be called indifferent be commanded as
things to be done of necessite and under the pains of deedly sin / as for
an example to eat flesh or fyshe this day or that day is indifferent and fre
/ also to goo in this raiment / of this color or that color / to shave our
hedes or not / a pressed to were a long goune or a short / a gray friar to were
a gray cote or a Russett / a whytte friar to were a whytte or a blake / a
priest to marry or not to marrye / an heremyt to have a berde or not / these
with all other such outward works / be things indifferent and may be used
and also left / now if the bisshops will make any law or statute that these
things shall be determynatlye used so that it shall not be lawfulle for us
to leave them un done / but that we must presyssely do them and not the
contrary under the pain of dedlye sin / here must they be with sto^ded and
in no wise obeyed for in this is hurt our faith and lyberte of christendom
where by we are fre and not bound / to any exterior work / but fre in all
things and un to all men at all tymys and in all manner / except yt be in
such a cause where as brotherly cheryte / or the commen peace should be
offended therefore in all these things be we fre and we must withstonde them
that will take this lybertye from us with this text of scripture / we are
bought with price we will not be ye servants of men / 1. Cor. 7.
this text is open agenste them that will bynd men's conscyens un to sin
in those things that Christ has left them fre in / off this we have an
euydent example of. S. Paul the which would not circumcise Titus when ye false
brethern would have compelled him there un to as a thing of necessyte unto
whom. Gala. 2.
S. Paul gave no romthe as consernynge to be brought in to subieccion. s.
Paul did not with stand them / by cause that circumsicion was vnlawfulle or
might not be used of christen men / but by cause that they would have compelled
him un to yt as unto a thing of necessyte / that thing would not. S. Paul
suffer / for that was agenst the liberty that we have in Christ Jesus as he
says here planly. wherefore we be not alo^ly by christ made fre from sin /
but also made fre in using all manner of things that be indifferent / and
unto them we cane not be bound as unto things of necessite as on the frydaye
to eat fyshe / and there unto be bound in conscience under the pain of dedly
sin / in this we may not obey for yt is agenst the word off god not be cause
/ it is evylle to eat fyshe (for in time convenient and whane thou art
disposed yt is good) but by cause that they will in this thing bind our
conscience and make that thing of necessite / that god has left fre.

Therefore speaks Paul agenst them in these words / In the latter days
serten men shall swerve from the faith applyng them self to the spretes of
errors / 1. Tim. 4.
and doctryns of the deuylle / for bidding marriage / and to absteyne from
mettes / that god has created to be reseued of faithfullmen with thanks /
for all creaturs of god be good / and nothing to be refused yt is reseued
with thanks / mark how Paul says / nothing is to be refufed that may be
reseued with thanks this is openly agenste them that will forbed other fyshe
or flesh this day or that day as a thing un right for a christian man to eat
for as. S. Paul says meat does not commend us un to god. 1. Cor. 8.
Also in an other place the kingdom of heaven is another meatt nor drink / Romans
14.
therefore they do un right to bind our consyens in such things / and to
think us vnfaythefulle by cause we observe the^ not. Now let our holy
hypocrites of ye charter housse look on their conscience / which rekken to by
and to selle heaven / for a piece of fyshe or flesh but they rekken yt no vice
to live in hatered / ranker / and malys / and neither to serve god nor their
neyboure but with such an hypocrites service as they have invented off their
own hypocrisy / and not reseued of god / they think yt a great perfeccion to
absteyne from befe and mutton / and to eat pyke / tenche gurnarde and all
other costly fyshys and that of the dentyyst fascion dressed / but a piece of
gross beffe may they not touch / may they not smelle for than they loss
heaven and all the merits of Christ's blood. Is not here a goodly feyned
hypocrisy? a fore the world yt shyneth bryghte / but compare yt un to Christ's
scripture and there cane not be a gretter balsphemy / for here in they clearly
damn Christ and his ordinance and make that of necessite that Christ left as
indifferent / agenste these holy hipocrites wrytteth. S. Paul saying / we
ought not to be led with the tradicions of me^ / Colo. 2.
that say touch not taste not / handylle not / which things peryshe with
using of them and are after the commandementes and doctryns of men / which
things have the symylitude of wysdom in supersticicyous holiness and humbylnes
in that they spare not the boddy and do the flesh no worship un to his need.
Here is clearly condemnyd all supersticiousnes and feynyd holiness that me^ have
inventyd in eating or drincking / in touching or in handeling / or in any other
such things not that we may not do the^ / but that we do them as things of
necessite and rekkyn our self holy when we do them / and to sin dedly when
we do them not / this is by the damnable institucions of men / The which S.
Augustine condemns in these words / The apostle says / Touch not /
ha^dille not etc^. Ad paui. Epi. 59.
By cause that those men by such obseruacions were led from ye verite / by the
which they were made fre / where of it is sprokyn the verite shall deliver you
/ It is a shame (says he) and inconvenient and far from the nobillenes of
your liberte (seeing you be the boddy of christ) to be disseuyd with shadows
and to be iudgid as sinners if you dispysse to observe these things / where
fore let no man evercome you (seeing you are the boddy of christ) that will
seem to be meke in heart in the holiness of angels and bringyng in things
which he has not seen etc^. Here have we planly that those things which be
of the inuencion of man do not bind our conscie^s though they seem / to be of
never so grett holiness and of humbillenes and holiness of angels as paul
says. Col. ^
where fore let them make what statutis they will / and as mvche holiness as
they cane devysse / Invent as much gods service as they cane think / and lie
that they have reseuyd it from heuyn / and that it is no less holiness than
angels have / and set there un to all their mandamus / remandamus /
excommunicamus / sub pena excommunicacionis maioris / et minoris / Precipimus /
Interdicimus / et sub indignacione dei omnipotentis / et apostoloru^ petri et
pauli ligamus / with all other such blasphemis / that they have (for douteles
if their belly were rippyd / there should be nothing found but blasphemis of
god and of his holy word / detraccions / Oppressions / Confusyons / damnacyons
of their poor brethern / Other good have we none of the^ / let all Christen
men answer to this of their conscyens if it be not true) And yet are we fre in
our co^scyens / and all these cane neither bynd / nor damn our conscience /
for we are fre made through christ / And in conscience not bound under the pain
of dedly sin / to nothing that man cane order or set / except it be
conteynyd in holy scripture / Epi. ad to propo. 72.
But in boddy we are bound to every man. This does S. Augustyne prove in these
words. Seeing that we be made of soul and of boddy / as long as we do lyve in
this temporalle lyffe we must vsse / to the norysheyng of this lyffe / these
temporalle goods Therefore must we of that part that belongythe to this liffe
be subject un to powers / that is / un to men that do minister worldly things
with some honor / but as consernyng that part / whereby we believe in god and
be called un to his kyngdum we ought not to be subject un to any man yt will
peruerte that same thing in us / that has plesyd god to give us to eternalle
liffe etc^

Here is it plain / that we in conscyens by christ be made fre / and nothing
cane bynd us un to sin but his word wonly. Now is it clearly opyn yt if any
power in heuyn / or earth command any thing agenst gods word / or to the
distruccyon or mynyshynge of the same no man may obey in any cave under the
pain of damnacion / for gods veryte is not in different to be left or not to
beleft. Again if man command any thing to be done that may be done in time
and place co^venient / If he will bind us un to indifferent things as un to
a thing of necessite / than shall we not do it / not by cause it is eville to
do / but that it is damnable to be done as a thing of necessite / Never ye
less if any of these things be commandyd of the byshopes as burdyns and as
things in different thane shall we keep them in time and place convenient /
as where I may by them serve my brother / or edyfye him or do him any good or
that it may be un to him any menys to come to the verite / never the less at
a another time / whane I am in place convenient where I shall not offend my
brother nor engender no sclaunder nor any dysquietnes in the common welthe /
There may I freely with out any charge of conscyens and with out all manner of
sin break the bisshopes commandyment / For it is but as a burdyn of a
tyrau^te / that is laid on us / and neither helpyth to the incresyng of gods
honor nor to the edyfyynge of our brethern / And they them self keep them
not. Of these speaks our master Christ / They bind grevous and intolerable
burdyns and lay them on men's necks / Mat. 23.
but they them self will not wons set their little finger to them As for an
example To ette flesh on the frydaye is forbodyn by the bishops / now if they
compelle the to it as un to a thing necessary and with out the which thou
canste not be sauyd than shalt thou not do it under the pain of sin / But
if they will have ye keep this as a thing of congruens / and as a thing yt may
be an exterior mean to mortify ye boddy / or an outward shine of holiness / and
un to this he will compelle the by outward pains / this thing shalt thou do
of thy cherite / by cause thou will not break ye outward order / nor make any
disquietnes for those things that neither make the good nor yet condemn the a
fore god / 1. Cor. 8.
for as S. paul says / if we eat nether are we the better / Nor if we eat
not are we ye worsse / Alleways prouidid that in these in different things
thou another set confyde^ce nor holiness / nor yet offend thy weke brothers
cherite / for there in though thou be fre in thy self and the thing is also
indifferent to the yet of cherite freely make thou thy self servant to all
men As S. Paul says When I was fre from all things yet did I make my self
a servant that I might win meny men / Note that he alleways speaks of weke
brethern (and not of obstinate and of induratyd persons / agenst whom thou
shalt alleways with stond an defend thy liberte as he did) he is thy weke
brother that has a good mind and beleuithe the word of god / 1. Cor. 9.
never the less he has not that gift to perseue as yet this liberty to vsse
indifferent things freely with thanks There fore faith and cherite must be
thy gyde in all these things and following the^ thou ca^ste not erte.

All manner of Christen men / both sprytualle and temporalle are bound when
they will be houslyd to reseue the sacrament in both kinds under the pain
of dedly sin.
IF men had stuck to the open scripturs of good / and to the practys of
christ's holy church and to the exposicion of old doctors as yt did be come
christen me^ to do / than had yt not been nedefulle for me to have taken these
paynys and labors in this cause / nor yet to have laid to their charges those
things yt Antichrist does wonly / but now seeing that they will do the open
deeds of Antichrist / they must be content that I may also give them his name /
and that all the world may openly know / that Antichrist does rain in the
world (ye and that under the name of Christ) I will here set you forth an
act of his which wha^ it is compared to our Master Christ's words I do not
dought but all true christen men will judge yt to be of the deuylle as it is
in very deed / though that the chyldern of the world do judge yt other wise.

This do I say of an act / that the cou^selle of constancie^s did make agenst
the most holy and glorius sacrament of our eternalle god Jesus christ. where
in the won kind of this most blessed sacrament was condemned as vnlawfulle for
lay men to reseue / and that every man may know / by what auctoryte they did
it / and what thing did move the^ to condemn so blessed and so glorious an
ordinance of our lord Jesus christ / here will I write their own words
which be these / The words of the counselle and determinacion of Antichrist
as this custom for avoydynge serten sclaunders and parrelles was resonably
brought in notwithstondinge in the begenynge off the church this sacrament was
reseued of christen men under both kinds / and afterward yt was reseued
alonly under the kind of bread / wherefore seeing that such a custom off the
church / and of holy fathers resonably brought in and long observed must be
taken for a law the which shall not be lawfulle to repreue / nor with out
auctoryte of the church to change yt at amans plesur / wherefore to say that
yt is sacrilege / or vnlawfulle to observe this consuetude or law / must be
judged erronius / and they that do pertinaciter defend the contrary off
these premissis / must be restrained as heretics and grevously ponysshyd by
the bysshoppes or their officialles / or by them that be inquisitores heretice
prauitatis which that be in kyngdoms or in provinces / in these men that do
attempt or presume any thing agenst this decre shall men proceed agenste
them / after the hollye and lawfulle decreys that be invented agenst heretykes
and their fauters / in to the favor of the catholycalle faith. etc^.

Now will I exhort all christen men in ye glorius name of our mighty lord
Jesus christ (which is both their redemer and shall be their judge) that they
will indifferently here this artykel discussed / by the blessed word of our
Master Christ Jesus which wasse not alonly of god / but also very god him
self / and all that he did was done by the counselle of the wholle trynyte /
and not alonly by his / by whose counselle all counsels both in heaven and
earth must be ordered / and that counselle that is contrary to yt whether yt be
of Saynct Angel or of man must be a cursed and judged to be of the devil /
though they be never so mighty / never so well learned / and never so meny in
multitude / for there is no power / no lernyng / nor yet no multitude nether in
heaven nor in earth / nor no iuperdes nor no sclanders that may judge Christ
and his holly word / nor that they may give place unto / wherefore yff I cane
prove by open scripturs / of our Master Christ / and also by the practes of
holly church / that this counselle / is false and damnable / than let all
christen men judge which of us must be hard and be believed either the
counselle having no scriptour ye contrary to all scripture / or else I that
have the open word of god / and the very use and practes of the holy
appostles and of holy church / Christ is of god / and that no man douteth /
but the holy counsel though there were fyve thousaddes bisshopes there in
must prove them self to be of god by ye word of god and by their works the
which they cane not do if they be contrary to Christ and his blessed word.

Moreover Christ is not true under a condition by cause that men do a low
him / for though all the world were agenst him / yet were he never the less
true / but the counselle is not true but allonlye under this condicyon by
cause yt does agree with Christ's holy word / and of yt self yt has no
veryte / but is off the devyll yff yt vary from Christ. A fore ye dreedfulle
trone of god shall the counselle be judged by Christ's holy word / and
Christ shall not be judged / by the decre off the counsel but he shall be
the counsels judge / and if christ's word condemn the counselle who shall
approve yt / who shall praise yt / who shall defend yt? The temporalle sword
/ nor ye multitude of bisshopes nor interdiccion / excommunicacion nor cursynge
/ cane than help. wherefore let every true christen man look on this matter
indifferently / it is no tryflyng with god nor with his holy word / for god
will remain for ever / and his holy word must be fulfilled / and yff we
will not fulfylle yt / he shall cast us dovne to the deep pytt of hell / and
make of stonys men in our stead that shall keep his word / yt is no light
thing / for yt lyethe on the salvation and damnacion both of boddy and soulle
/ from the which we can not be delivered / with these glorious words /
Concilium / Concilium / Patres / Patres / Episcopi / Episcopi / for all these
may be the minysters of the deuylle / ye though they were angels / therefore
wons again / I do monyshe and exhort in the glorious name of the living god
/ and in the swet blood of christ Jesus all true christen men / to take heed
what they do agenste christ's holy word which is their eternalle god / their
mercifulle redemer and shall be also their mighty and glorious judge. Now let
us examen the words of the counsel. First of all the counsel grants that
in the begenyng of the church / all christen men were housled under both
kinds / now would I know of the counsel of whom the church had reseued this
manner: of christ? or his holy appostles (as doughtles she did) than what
auctoryte had the counselle to change the institucion of christ / and of his
holy appostles / and also ye use and practys of holy church / was not the
first church of god? Did she not keep Christ's institucion? did she not
fulfill christ's word? Did not the holy appostles learn hare so? and now
shall the counsel of constanciens first conde^me Christ and his blessed
word / and thane the lerninge of Christ's holy appostles? and also the long
use and practes of christ's blessed church / with out any scripture / with out
auctorite or with out any special reuelacion from god but alonly for avoydyng
of serten perelles? ye and not content alonly to condemme these things but
under the pain of heresy to condemn them / this is to sore a condemnacion of
christ's open word and of that thing which they grant that the church did use
at the begenyng.

Forthermore the counselle says that holy fathers and the church did bring
in this custom to housseile lay men under won kind / are you not a shamed of
these words? Does not your conscience pryke you thus openly to lie? ye of
Christ and of his holy church? Christ's word is openly agenste you / and you
grant that the use of the church was also other wise / and as for holy
fathers here may you se what they say to it / but you are the chylderne of
the kingdum of lyis / and doughtles if you bring not forth the holy fathers
that make for you / you shall not allonly be taken for abominable and open
liars / but also for shamfulle and detestable sclanderars both of holy
church and also of holy fathers.

But it is no wonder for Antichrist must declare him self openly to be agenst
Christ and yet is he never with out an excuse / and a shadow of holiness /
where by he may blind the poor people / but what excuse had he here in the
counsel to condemme Christ's word? That they might avoyde serten sclanders
and perils and because that there is no boddy with out blood. Be not these
lawfulle causys to condemn christ's open word / ye and that under the pain
of heresy? Is not this a new manner of law to make that he that will not obey
a statute made against gods word which he is bound to obey under pain of
everlasting damnacion / allonly for a voydynge parelles to be condemned for an
heretyke? Breuely by this reason may they condemme all holy scriptur / by
layynge iuperdys and perils there to / they may condemme all the creaturs of
god / for there may be peril in using of them all. But what need meny
words to prove this counselle to be of ye deuylle? for if that be not of the
devil that is contrary to christ / and has no excuse for it but alonly to
avoid perelles / I can not tell what is of the devil? I am suer Antichrist
shall never be with out some carnalle excuse / for if he will deny christ to
be both god and man / he shall have stronger carnalle reasons for him than the
counselle has for this / but this matter must not be judged by carnalle
reasons / yt is gods word that is a boue all creatures / wherefore let us
goo to the scripturs as a suer ancore to overcome Antichrist with all his
carnalle reasons. First our master Christ when he did institute this blessed
sacrament did use these words / take yt and eat yt this is my boddy. etc^.
Likewise taking ye challyce he gave thanks and gave yt un to them saying /
Matt. 26^ Mar. 14. ^uce. 22.
drink all off this / this is my blood of the new testamente the which
shall be shed for many in to remissyon of sins / these be plain words
drink of yt all / he that says all excepteth no man / forthermore he knew
that there might be iuperdys in the reseuyng of yt and yet he says drink of
yt all / for yt is my blood that shall be shed for the remission of sins.

Now was it not shed for lay men's sins? why shall they not than drink of yt?
The master and the lord says drink there of / and shall the miserable
servant withstonde his commandiment / ye command the plain contrary and say
drink not there of?

But now comes my lord of Rochester (which perseueth that the counsel is
conuicte in that that it co^senteth that the whole church in the begenynge did
reseue this sacrament under both kinds / and yet forbyddeth that same thing
(and says to mayntene this error) that Christ spoke these words drink of yt
all / alo^ly to his appostles for there were no another me^ there but the
appostles / and therefore they must alonly drink there of. I answer. My lord
if this thing were alonly lawfulle unto the appostles / how will you dyscharge
the primatyue church / In the which were thosse men yt christ mynisterd this
sacrament unto / ye and the self me^ did mynyster yt under both kinds to the
wholle congregation acording to this comma^dime^t drink of yt all / dought not
but they understood christ's will as well as you in this co^mandyme^t. But in
ye way of co^municacio^ let us grant you / that to ye appostles this was
wonlye said / how will you tha^ discharge your own prestes from dedly sin?
ye which reseue it under both kinds / and yet be they another apostles nor
successors of the^ / but after your own lernyng ye bishops alonly be their
successors / and the prestes do represent.lxxij. disciples / shall they in this
thing represent the appostles / and in absoluyng from sin but the discyples?
But ^ett us se forther in your for fetched reason / tell us how and by what
auctoryte (your hye polytyke rule saved) that you dare give either of these
kinds to the lay men seeing they were both alonlye given to the appostles /
for even by that auctoryte that you have power to take away the won kind / by
that self same have you power to take away the other / for they were both
given at wons and indifferentlye to the reseuers so that as meny as reseued the
won reseued also the other / and to them that he said take and eat this / this
is my boddye / to them he said / drink all of this. etc^.

Now if you may thus take away the parts of the sacraments at your plesur
yt conseque^t shall be that incontynvans all the sacraments shall be
dystroyd / and Christ's word set at naught. wherefore my lord this
blasphemous evasion will not help you / but such shamfulle solucions must
they use that will be agenst ye open word of god / amend your conscience my
lord / for if you do not remember the teryble words of the prophet / he
shall shake his sword and bend his bow and make yt all reddye and there in
has he prepared the shot of death / and his arrowys for to burn / this is
no small threttenynge nor lyghtely to avoid.

But let us se what the scripturs say / that which I gave unto you I reseued
of the lord / mark. S. Paul's words how he reseued this thing of the lord.
etc^.

The lord Jesus the same night in the which he was betrayyd / took bread and
thankyd and brake yt and said / Take ye and ette this is my boddy which is
brokyn for you this do ye in the remembrance of me / After the same manner / he
took the Cup and said this cup is the New testament in my blood this do /
as often as you drink in the remembrance of me / for as o^tyn as you shall ette
this bred and drink this cup / you shall show the lordys death till he come
/ Mark diligenly how Saint Paulle declarythe how the lord Jesus Christ did
institute this blissed and comfortable sacrament / in both kinds / and in
both kyndys did minister it him self and not that allonly / but also annectyd
this co^m^ement to all Christen people which must re^ue yt. This do as oftyn.
etc^. ye and this co^mand^me^t is given after the sacrament is ministerd in
both kindys / Theachyng us that in both kyndys the lord has institute this
sacrament to be reseued / and also that they that so reseue yt not / break this
commandment of the lord / This do as often. etc^ This co^ma^deme^t. Saint
Paul did not lightly let slype / but he knew that it was the ordinance and
the commandment of the lord / and also knew that won Jot or tyttylle of his
wordys / should not / nor ought nor can not be let slype / with out perrell of
the soulys of them that so lyttylle makys on his word ^ And therefore he
durst not / nor would not (And yet he had as great auctoryte as the counsel of
co^stanciens) let slype or transepose the institucyon and commandment of the
lord / but wholly and fully / with al diligence he wrotte those wordys un to
all the wholle co^gregacyon of the Corinthyanes / not^ to the ministers or
pristis allonly but to ye wholle congregation that is as well to the ministers
of the word as to lay men and also the co^trari / for he says when you come
to gether / and that you may perseue yt he spepis indifferently / he there
repreuithe the^ yt tarryed not for pore me^ / And also these words be plain /
who so ever shall ette of this bread and drink of this cup worthily. etc^.
Now unto this wholle congregation (I dought not but by the spreat of the lord
which saw be fore this damnable error to be institute of Antichrist and his
very and allonly mynisters) he said drink you / ye and to repreue and
manifestly to declare this opyn error / he addithe this word / Cup /
signifiynge and teacheynge that christ's ordinance is not to reseue the blood
in ye boddy wonly / but to reseue the blood (after his institucion) by it
self out of ye cup / lest they should be found corectours and blasphemers of
the holy institution and co^mandyme^t of the lord / Of whom. S. paul reseuyd
this commandment / and of no counselles. Now what christen man can dought but
our Master christ to whom all thing is bare and opyn both thingis present and
also to come knew that there was blood in his own boddy / Also Saint paul his
scolare which learned this lesson of him was not ingnorant yt there was blood in
his body / And yet first our. M. christ geuithe his blood a lone by it self
out of ye cupp / and his dilligent scolar knowing yt doctrine of his. M. did ye
same regarding his masters doctrine and preferryng it by fore his carnal reason
which knew that there was blood in every body / but his.M. doctrine taught him
yt his.M. kept not his blud in his bodi / but for us / lost and damned parsons
for our innumerable detestable (and a boue all capassyte to declare) damnable
and abominable sins / Brake his boddy and shed his blood there out
ple^tuusly and there with made sacrifice and satysfaccio^ for all our sins
as. S. Ioha^ says / The blood of Jesus christ cleanses us from all sin /
also we are santifyde by the offering off the body off Jesus christ wons for
all / now yt all christian me^ which be santifide by ye offering of this boddy /
1. Joan. 1^
and by sheding ye blood out of this boddy / should all ways have both those
parts in remembrance / Hebre. 10.
he according as the blood was divided from the body for all sinners
indifferently yt will come un to christ And a cordynge to his masters
institucyon and commandment / ministerde this sacrament and also ordened yt to
be ministered to all men / The body / by it self and ye blood by it self /
That they might all way not remember alo^ly that our savior christ offered his
boddy for us / but also shed out of that same body his most precius blood and
therefore says. S. paul (as his Master christ taught him) As often as you
shall ette this bread and drink this cup / you shall show the lords death
tylle he come. Now my lordys come to your counselles. Christ and Saint Paull
defendythe this thing partinacyter (as you call yt) that is stytfy and
strongly will they a bide by it and will not revoke it / wherefore after the
decre of your Counselle they be condemned for heretykes. I can no more say but
god help them for there is no remedy with the^ but they must nedis to the fire
/ for they will not be abiured in nowisse / it is a pittyus case that.ii. so
good men as these be / will be thus openly agenst the decre of the holy counsel
ye and agenst so meny and so noble fathers / and so great clarkis the which knew
this matter (as ye say) as well as they / and it is not to be though that the
holy ghost would leave so menny excelent and holy fathers / and great doctors of
dyuinite / and so meny noble princes and wisse men of the world / And be with
these.ij. poor me^ which be of no reputacyon in this world / wherefore my
lords proceed agenst them after the holy decreys that he inuentyd agenst
heretykys / styck not for their namys for it is neither christ nor paulle that
can hurt you / you have also condemned there lernyng and preuaylyd agenst the^
why should you not condemn them as well / you be lords / and you have the
stre^gthe and the wysdum of the world with you and as a sertyne doctor of law
said / they have no man to hold with them but a sort of begers and dyspysyd
persons of the world / wherefore spare them not / be bold / Implete numerum
patru^ vestrorum / All tyrans be not yet deed. But now wha^ you have condemned
them / yet have you as much to do as ever you had: De consecia. di. 2. ^
c^perimus
for your own law is openly agenste you in these words. We understood that
sertyn men reseuyng alonly the portion of the blessed boddy / do abstain from
the chalys of the holy blood the which doughtles (seeing I can not tell by
what superstycyon they are learned to abstain) let them either reseue the
whole sacrament or else let them be forbyddyn from the whole sacrament / for
the dyuision of won and of the same mystery cane not be done with out grett
sacrylege. etc^.

How think you by these words? be they not plain that all men shall either
reseue both kinds or none / here have you a another heretyke / for he Judges
and says that it is sacrilege (which is openly agenst your counsel) to
reseue yt in won kind. But peradventure you will say this law was written to
pristes I answer To whom so ever it was written it makes no matter for these
wordis be plain / The diuysyon of won mystery ca^ not be done with out great
sacrilege / These wordis be not spoken of ye persons that shall reseue yt / but
of the deuydynge of the sacrament / who so ever shall reseue yt / yt is
sacrylege to deuyde this thing / answer you to that. Mark also that your
own law callythe yt supersticion to reseue but won kind and no dought they
that did reseue yt so where blindyd by this damnable reason of youres yt there
is no boddy with out blood / and yet he calls yt supersticion. But let us
see what your gloss says on this text / yt is not superfluusly (says he)
reseued under both kinds / for ye kind of bred is referryd un to ye flesh /
and yt kind of wine un to ye blood / The wine is ye sacrament of blood in the
which is the seatte of the solle / and therefore it is reseuyd under both
kinds to sygnifie that Christ did reseue both boddy and soul / and that the
pertakynge there off does profit both boddy and soul. wherefore if it were
reseuyd alonly under won kind it should signify that it did profit allonly
but won part. etc^. How think you does this gloss understand it of pristes
wonly? have lay men no souls? May not this sacrament profit the^ both body
and soul? Mark also yt he says it is not superfluusly nor with out a cause
reseuyd under both kinds. Also an other law / De co^sec^. di. 2. c. cum
fra^gimus.
When the host is brokyn and the blood shed out of the chalys in to the
mouthys of faithful men / what other thing is there signyfid but ye

out of his side. etc^.

Here is it plain that the blood is geuyn out of the chalys and not out of the
boddy / and in to faythefulle men's mowthis and not allonly in to pristes
mowthis. De co^sec^. di. 2. c. Siquocienscumquod.
Also an other law / if yt the blood of christ be shed for remyssion of syns
(as oftyn as it is shede) thane ought I lawfully for to reseue it. I which do
all ways sin must all ways reseue a medecyn etc^. Here your own law
says / that the reseuyng of the blood is a medycinealle ways to be reseuyd of
the^ that sin: you will not deny but that laymen sin. where fore should
they not than reseue a medecyn for their sin? you may perseue that this is
not alonly spokyn of pristes but of sinners. Ad Corneliu^ Papa^.
Furthermore S. Ciprian says How do we reach or how cane we provoke men to
shed their blood for the confessyo^ off christ's name if we do deny them the
blood off christ when they shall go to batylle? Or how dare we able them un to
the victordum of marterdum / if we do not first by right admit the^ to drink
the Cup of our lord in the co^gregacyon etc. Here is Cyprian opynlye agenst
you which will that as meny shall reseue the blood of christ as do confess
the name of christ ye and that out of the cup and not out of the boddy Also
S. Ambrose says to the Emperor Theodosyus / Ecclesiastica hist.
how shalt thou lift vpe they hondes out of yt which does yet drop un
ryghtwise blood? how shalt thou with those ho^des reseue ye boddy of god? with
what boldness will thou reseue in to thy might ye Cup of ye pr^cius blood
seeing yt through the wodnes of thy words so great blood is shed wrongfully etc^
Mark yt ye manner was in S. Ambrose time yt lay me^ should reseue the blessid
blood of christ ye and that out of the cup severally / and not out of the
boddy wonly / where fore my lords se to your conscyens how you cane discharge
your self a fore the dredfulle trone of christ Jesus / for making this
detistable and damnable statute agenste ye heuynly word of god / and agenste
the vsse of holy church and contrary to the exposycion of all holy doctors /
It were to great a thing for you so preumtuously to break the statute of your
mortalle prince how much more of your immortale god which will not be a
voydyd with a carnalle resu^ nor with conde^nacyo^ of heresy / nor yet with
sayng there be Iuperdes perrelles and sclandres / for these proud crakes cane
not there excuse you nor yet help you. for I dought not but the grett Turk
has as good resons for him as these be and also as proud crakes as you have /
though peradventure he vsythe the^ not so hipocritly against god omnipote^t as
you do / but yet it will not help him / where fore now most excelent and
gracious prince I do with all meknes / with all due subyeccyon admonyshe and
exhort your most noble grace / ye and the father of heuyn does opynly
command you under the pain of his displesur / and as you will a void the
danger of eternalle damnacyon / and also by the virtue of christ's blessed blood
and as you will reseue remission from al yovre sins through the merittes of
his glorious blood / That you do defend with all your might Christ's blessed
word and his swet blood / and his holy ordinance / and suffer the^ not so
lightly to be oppressyd and trodyn under ye foot / your grace may not consider
in this cause the multitude / nor the dygnite of me^ / for you be as good as ye
best of the^ / but your grace must consider that it is god omnipotentes cause
/ it is christ's cause / it is the word of god / it is the bleued blood of
Christ that is over trodyn / it is ye ordynance yt commyth out of heaven / and
not out of cou^sellys ye and geuyn by god him self / and not by man's auctoryte
/ And now shall your grace suffer this thing so lightly to be broken by cause
men do invente a carnal reason agenste it? the devylle was never with out a
reason / but that prouythe not the cause agenste gods word. King Saul had no
small reason for him / 1. Reg. 15
when he did save King Agag and the best sheep and oxen to offer to god / was
not this a reasonable cause / to save ye bestys to gods honor and to offer
the^ up un to god? was it not a goodly shine to save ye king rather than to
kylle him / what man will rekyn it evil to save a man? what man can judge it
evyll to save bestis / ye and that the best to offer them to god? was not god
best worthy? was not this a good consyderacion? was not this a good intent?
Fynallye yt is ten tymys better than the reason of the counselle is / and yet
Saull with all his good reason / with all his good devotion / with all his good
purposse / with all his ^atte bestys is repellyd of god for ever and all by
cause he stuck to his good inte^cion and left the commandment of god / Sum
men will think it but a light thing whether they reseue the blessed blood by
yt self or ellis with ye boddy / but as light as they think yt yet is it
gods word yet is it Chrystis ordinance / yet did ye apostles observe yt /
yet did the holy church so fulfill yt / And if the word of god were away by
reason yt were but a light thing to baptyse in watter or in wine / but ye word
of god is open yt it must be done with watter and not in wine and yet there is
no cause why but ye word of god. Moreover by reason it was but a light thing to
say / zacha. 9. Mat. 20.
Be glad thou daughter of Syon be hold they king co^myth to the syttyng on an
ass and on hare fool this saing by reason is not alonly Simple / but also
foolyshe to say that a king shall come rydyng on an Ass ye and on a borowyd
ass and there of to make so much a do as though yt were a notable thing /
who would not now mock a king if he did so ride / not with stondynge all this
these be the wordis of god / ye and also fulfyllyd in very deed of our Master
Christ in his own proper parson. Luc. 2.
Moreover by reason / yt was but a mad tokyn that the savior of the world
christ Jesus was borne / to say you shall find a young child wrappyd in
clouttes and laid in a crybbe / what is this to purposse? what is this to
prove that the sauyoure of the world is borne will not reason mock this? when
will reason be persuadyd by this token that Messiah (who^ all the prophets and
all the patryarkes have promised so many hunderd yerys a fore (was now borne
and yet this tokyn came from heaven ye and by the mynystracion of angels and
ye sheperdys did believe the word / Breuely by reason what be all the artykylles
of the faith? where is Christ? where is remyssion of sins? where is the lyffe
to come? Reason mocketh all these things but yet they be true / by cause
allonly ye word of god speaks the^. where for most noble and excellent prince
/ look on the word of god and not of blind reason and save ye honor there of
/ for it shall save your grace at your most need. Furthermore I do exhort and
require with all honor ye and I do co^ma^de in the virtue of christ Jesus
and his blyssed word All dukes / all Erryllys / all lordis / all manner of
estattes hye and low that will be christen men / Io. 6.
that will be sauid by the virtue of Jesus Christis blessed blood that they do
se this ordynance of the god of heaven observed too the vttermoste of thyer
power and wha^ so ever that they will be houshed that they reseue the blessed
sacrament under both kinds / and at the lest desyer yt with all their heart
of their currates and so desire it yt they may be dyschargyd a fore the
immortal god off heuyn which will not be mokkyd nor avoydyd with a damnable
reason / but what so ever thing there be that is agenst the holly word of god /
and the glorius ordinance what color so ever yt bring with yt of holiness let
yt be a cursed and reknyd of the deuell / This does. S. Cypryan learn us sayng
/ what thing so ever yt be yt is ordened by man's madness / where by the
ordinance of god is violatyd / yt is whoredum / it is of the deuell and it is
sacrilege / where fore fly from such contagiusnes of me^ and a void their
words as a canker and as pestilence etc^.

These words be plain of all manner of me^ of what estate what dygnyte / or of
what honor so ever they be and what color of holiness so ever they bring
with them / wherefore in this present writing I do cou^selle and exhort all
true christen men to take heed what they do the word of god is so plain in
this matter yt they can desyer it no plainer / it is no chyldes game to trifill
with gods word / god will not be trifylyd with nor yet mokkid. But now to
help pore me^ yt be unlearned I will a soyll sertin of their damnable reso^s /
the first is we will not give it under ye kind of wine lest yt there should by
negligens either of the pryst or of the reseuer fall any drop on the
ground. I answer our.M christ did know that such a chanche might come / you
can not deny yt (except you will say yt he was not god / as you would not
greatly stycke to do if you might have mantynens) and yet not with stondyng did
he institute yt in both kinds / Answer you to this. More over why do not by
this reason your own prystes abstain from the wine seeing that this perrell
may also cha^che the^ as your cautellis of the mass do grant / Also if it be
a reasonable cause yt you shall not keep christ's ordinance / by cause of a
voydyng of parelles than may you take a way all the wholle sacrament to a
void perrelles / for in reseuyng of it in the kind of bread / is Iuperdus
lest their remain any crumme in ye reseuers tethe / This reason is as good as
youres so that now all the sacrament in both kinds is taken a way.
Forthermore / if you will a void all perrelles tha^ may you give this
sacrament to no man for you can not tell who is in dedly sin and who not /
for you know not their hartis and it were a sore perrell and greatly more
Iuperdye to give ye puer body of christ Jesus in to a foull soul tha^ yt a
drope of blude by neglige^s should faull on ye ground / for there fallith but a
drope and here is ye wholle boddy in a foullare place than ye ground is. Also
yt may be avoided with good dylyge^ce and wisdu^ of ye prist / but yt ye
sacrament shall all wais be reseuid in to a puer co^scie^s there is no diligence
of ye prist yt ca^ make it. How think you now? now is all ye wholl sacrament
and christ's blessed ordinance clearly taken a way and all for a voydyng
Iuperdis and perrellis / thus triffylle you with christis holy word / ye and
that in your great and holy cou^selles. Other resons my lord of Rochester
brings that be worthy of no solucion / for he does but mock and scorn and
triffylle with goods word / Io. 6.
he brings ye myrakylle of the five louys where there is no me^cyon made of
wine / Ergo lay me^ must be housselyd in won kind / is not this madness? whatt
mean these men that neither fere god nor yet be a shamed of man? what is this
to the purposse? Christ did a myrakylle of five louys where is no mencyon made
of wine? what is this too the sacrament? yff the bread signyfyde won part of
the sacrament what signifide the.ii. fyshis and the he ye that was there
these.ij. things must nedis signify the other part. Also lay me^ did touch
this bread. Moreover in an other place / christ geuythe allonly wine / Ergo the
sacrament must be reseuyd in the Kind of wine allonly off the lay me^. Be not
these goodly arguments ye and that of bisshops? yt were madness too answer too
them

It is agenst scripture to honor images and to pray to saynctes.
IF men had the very true faith in Christ Jesus that belongs to Christen
men to have / this article were open of it self with out anny forther
probacion / for if men did believe first that Christ were god and omnipotent /
and mighty to give all things: secondarily that he were mercifulle / gracious
/ and loving toward us / and so lovynge yt we culde desyer nothing of him but
yt he would give it us / if me^ (I say) had this faith and this love toward
Christ / they would goo no forther but to him only they would make in vente /
and devyse no mediators / but faithefully reseue him (acordyng to the
scripturs) for their wonly mediator / savior and redemer / and believe and know
suerly / that they could axe nothing so grett in his name but that they should
reseue it / so that he would him self give yt and there un to is abyll. Also
by this faith they should perfyttly know / that they could not be so unworthy
but he of his only and mere marcye is abylle and also would make them worthy to
reseue their peticions / so that if men had faith they should perfytly know
that they had need of no more than this won Christ that they should nor ought
not seek to no other mediator / either to obtain any thing / or else to make
them worthy but should know and confess both in word and deed / that Christ
alonly is abylle enough ye and so mighty and so mercyfulle / yt all other
feigned and invented mediators of me^ be vile / fylthy and abominable of them
self / to be compared to him. If this faith (I say) ware prynted in ye hearts
of men / tha^ what should they or could they desyer more tha^ this won mediator
Jesus Christ / what could they have yt of him and by him they could not
obtain? truly nothing yt they could ryghttully axe / as all scripturs bear
wyttnes. But now let all these makers of new gods cumylate the^ self to
gether on a hepe / and show me but won place ye won Jot / or won example in
holy scripture yt ever me^ did pray to saynctes? or wo^ yt entered in to heaven
by saynctes prayers? christ assended (as ye scripturs be plain) in to heaven
by his own power / now would I know of these new godmakers by whose power and
help yt the first sayncte came in to heaven / say not by ye intercession of
saynctes for I will say than yt there were none in heaven / nor by his own
holiness for tha^ dyed christ in vain / and if he came by christ wo^ly? why may
he not alone help us thither? his power is not wekyd / his marcye is no less
toward us than yt was toward him. Now here you se all the causys that
brought the first saint to heaven / and these causys be sufficient ye and
alonly a lowed of the scripturs of god / ergo they be also sufficient for us /
if we will believe the scripturs of god. But now to declare and make this
matter open I will resite the words of the scripturs / first I will speak of
images / of whom spekith Moses these words. Exodus 20 Deute. 5
Thou shalt make ye no graue^ images nor similitude of any thing yt is in
heaven above or in earth by nethe / or in watters under ye earth / thou shalt
nether honor nor worship the^. Be not these words plain agenst all manner of
images or similitudes? for if saints be in heaven or in earth / or under ye earth
/ here be their fygurs excepted other to be honored or worshupped: and mark
that he excepteth both honoring and also worshypynge / now what cane you give
to images yt is neither honor / nor worship? It makes no matter to me /
whether you call yt latria or dulia / if it be either honor or worshypp tha^
is it agenst scripture / and if it be neither / tha^ is it nothing but avoid
name inverted of your insaciable couytusnes to disseue simple me^ with and to
heepe innumerable goods to your self / for if you had no more profit^ by
images tha^ you have deuocio^ to the^ / than should they be sone left dovne /
who has seen a precius offering of a pressed given to any image? but we se
daily how ye rob images of other men's oblacio^s. But let us return to our
purposse / Duns on this text says / Duns 3. distin. 9*
yt by yt was yt forbydde^ to make images a fore ye incarnacion of christ. etc^
Now must you prove where they be a lowed syns ye incarnacio^ and show with
manifest scripturs where this text is condemned in the new testament or else it
stondeth fast age^ste you after your own. M. Duns / whom you dare not
deny. Also the prophet / a man did plant a pinaple tree / and the rain did
noryshe it / Esa. 44.
and there off was made a fire un to me^ / he took of it and wermed him / and
burnt yt and baked bred there with / and of ye other part he made him a god /
and did honor yt / and prayed unto yt saing / deliver me for thou art my god /
mark ye process of the prophet / first ye man planted this tree / than he
burnte part of yt and baked bread with it / and of the other part he made him
a god who^ he honored and worshyped / mark also if all these be not true and
fulfyll^d of your images / of the won is made your god which you do honor /
and of who^ you desyer to be delivered / sum from death / sum from syknes / sum
from pestilencie / sum from poverte / sum from theuys / sum from yvylle fortune
/ sum from hanging / sum from drovnynge / and sum to save you from the tothe
ache / sum to save your horse / sum your pyges / and sum to help your wyme^
with child / with many other things more / so that for everye thing that you
will desyer you have a god to ask yt of / now of ye other part is made a
pair of gaullous / is not this true? is not this plain? of what other thing
in earth cane the sayng of the prophet be veryfyd but of your images? and if
yt may be veryfyd of an hundred other things yet is yt also true of your
images and un to them a greyth most peculiarly / the prophet speaks not of
won thing only but of all things that be like / now deliver your gods if
you cane / they will not be delivered with the answer ye doctor Rydley did
wons make un to me / that there was no man so blind nor so mad or foolyshe for
to honor ye stock and the stone yt stondeth a fore them / but they refer the
honor to that thing yt the image does represent / I answer good Master
doctor / I pray you tell me won thing / what did Cicero with all the holle
senators of Rome? did they not honor that same thing that stod a fore them
(and yet as you say) they did refer yt un to ye thing that was there by
represented these men were wise men and as well learned in their time as you /
and yet you see (for lake of knowledge of the troth) they honored stocks and
stones / I am suer you will not excusse them from ydolatrye ye and that by
cause they did honor the stocks and stonys / and not alonly for honourynge
of the thing that was represented. 3. Reg. 12.
Also what did Roboam wha^ he did set up.ij. golden cauluis in bethell and
said to the people Go no more to Jerusalem be hold thy gods Israel. Was
not this done to the honor of god? for they were not so mad (as ye say) to
thynk that those caluys were goddis / but they did honor them in the honor
of god and that was well declared in their sacryfice which was none other / but
such as god had co^mandyd in the law / Ergo after your rule they might
lawfully honor these calves referring it to god / They had also a great Color
for them / for all the old fathers did always offer to god Caluys / as Abraham
with meny other which oblacyon was acceptyd of god / where fore they might well
think that god would be honouryd in the Imagis of caluys. Now what thing can
you lay to the^ where by you will prove that they honouryd their stockys and
their stonys and there caluys but those same thyngys shall also be laid unto
you and unto youres to prove that you do like wysse honor your stockis and
your stonys. First you run from place to place to seek the^ which is a token
that you do honor the stock or stone / for there have you nothing of ye
saynct more tha^ in an other place saving wonly ye stock and stone. Now when
you have found them than pray you a fore them / And yt with knelingis / and
knokkingis / and shaking of your hedis and lokinge devoutly and pituously /
than kiss you their fete or their showis (for they be seldo^ bare foted lest
they should have ye murre or couffe by ye reason they be not used to could as
you may se by their smokid scolio^s fac^s ha^dis and fete with all ye place
where they stand) and wype your napkyns and rub your bedes on the^ and
lick the^ with your tongis and lay your yi^s on the^ / Than see you lighttis
a fore the^ / and tha^ offer you to the^ (Though in ye.M. doctor your person
is nothing gilty) great oblacyons so yt they shine in gold and silver and
precius stones ye and not thus content / but also promise to vysyt that stock
wons a year if god and ye good saint send you ly^e and health. etc^. I pray you
is note this honoringe of the stock and stone? what did Cicero. with all ye
romans to their stockis? and stonis? what did roboam to his Caluis if this be
not honoryng / defyne me what honoryng is what more exterior honor can you
deuyse tha^ this is? and yet you do say that you honor no stockis nor stonys /
but wordly shame and inuincyble scrypturs have brought you to make this
damnable evasyon by cause you se men now wax wysse in the lord / by the
which they see clearly your false dissimulacyon and hypocryse / but if you
were the true honorars of god as you be secret hipocrytis / you would not make
this damnable evasyon to stablyshe / up hold and maintain your Idolatry /
nor yet suffer (so much as lay in you) any thing to be done that has any
color or shaddowe of holiness that might be an occasyon of Idolatry / but by
cause you be hypocrytes and insatiable belly gods you care not (so you may
disseue the sympille people and led them with blind shadows there by to
fylle your offering boxis and chestes to maintain your insatiable carnal
^ppytytes) how ye honor of god be sauyd / or how your pore brothers co^scie^s
be disseued / think you that this is enough to say that no man is so mad nor so
folyshe as to honor ye stocks and stonys / And yet to suffer and daily a
fore your yies to see / so great exteryour honor given unto the^ / That no
tongue ca^ express nor heart ca^ deuysse more / ye if you will believe your
subtylle Duns they give un to them (as I shall well prove by his diffyncyon)
honor which is called Latria the which latria after your own lernyng ought
to be geuyn to god wonly. This says Duns / Latria is called an exteryour
honoring or a boddyly service. etc^.

Now if yt be true / yt follows that they give that honor to stocks and
stonys that wo^ly pertaynythe to god / which do any exterior honor (whether
yt be offering of ca^delles or kissyng of their showys or any other thing) too
them / Make you the conclusion / for I need not to say that they do Idolatrye.
For thermore / This word latria (where with you disseue the sympylle people)
is a greek word and after. S Augustyn yt sygnifithe no more but service / the
which you can not deny but that you give too your stockis and stones /
conclude now this proposicion after.M. subtle doctor Duns dyffynycio^ I pray
you / for I have no lesure. Thinks your doctorhed yt ye childern of Israel
with their hie prist Aro^ could not have made this pop holy excuse yt they
were not so mad nor so follyshe as to honor ye golden Calfe / but rather to
refere ye honor to ye living god / they had a good color for the^ for they
knew none other god nor saint but him / and yet this excuse was not lawful
nor could not be a lowyd wha^ Moses came with ye word of god / Mark also what
he was yt made this Calf / not a fool nor ignorant parson a monge the people or
won off none auctoryte / But the most wysyste eloquenste and chief a monge
them / ye he was that time the very head of the church or congregation. Also
note yt intent which was to keep the peopille to gether in good order / he
also made a calfe with the which thing all their fathers had plesyd god in
doing sacrifice with them / so that they might well think that it might be
acceptable to god to be honouryd in ye image of a calfe by fore any other image
/ but all these colors be nakyd by fore the word of god. Breueli would you
allow that the people should give that same honor to me that they give to
your stocks and stonis? And under the same colloure that it should be in the
name and honor of god (you cane not say but I am as good as your best stocks
and stonys: and if they be the Image of saints and represent saints after
your faynynge / I am the Image of god and represe^t him so long as I believe
in him acordyng to the holy scripturs / And if a connyng and an artificialle
grauer made them / god made me. And I have.ij. things a boue the^ which all
your caruers / and you with all your distinccio^s can not give to your
stocks nor stonys / That is I am a living creature / and your stocks be
deed: I am created to live with the everlasting god and your stocks be made
to the fire) I am suer you nor no man will allow it. But there is won marvelus
wonder That if the best and most holy of all your new Gods ye won that
does miracles every day were takyn out of your hondes and set a gain in
the caruers and his makers house he should be no better thane a stock or a
stone / nor could do no myrakles ye if he were prayed never so much / no not
somuche as if the housse were and fire to save either the housse or him self.
Also yt is not lawfulle so long as he there stondeth neither to pray to him
nor yet to offer to him which offering would both help the poor man his
wyffe chylderne and servants / but let them suffer you to take this wormye
god in to your hondes again / and than is he lord over all the world / than
makes he rich men and poor men / than makes he men blind / and blind to se
again / than makes he lame men wholle / than makes he women with child / ye^
and also brings them well to bed. Then expels he deuylles / than tells
he things to come / thane rulethe he in heaven and earth and in watter /
breuely he defendethe both king and kingdom / Is not here a sudden mutacion /
and all is by cause he has got him a new Master and a new place. O you
hypocrites think you that men be so blind that they cane not se this falsed
you would make them blind in deed the which would make them to honor stocks
and stonys ye and that in the name of an other thing the which also they
know not / which of you all has seen our lady or any other saint where by
you may learn to make hare symylitude? and if you have nothing to lay for you
/ but because she was a woman / thane is your Image as much the symilitude of
an harlott of the stuys the which berythe all the shape that belongs to a
naturalle woman as well as our lady / nothwithstondinge that our blessed lady
is a virgyn and the other a stru^pet / yet in exterior formis and shapes that
may be seen and judged by senses be they all won / ye and your image in all
exterior sygnis is a great delle more lykker un to an harlott / than to a puer
and a blessed meke virgyn / and yet ar you not a shamyd with these damnable
shadows / both to private god of his honor and also compelle your
simpelle brethern to this sha^fulle idolatrye. If you will look your self
and see clearly your idolle in a puer mirror / read the.vi. chapter of Baruch
/ Baruc. 6.
where in you shall find these words / *
Their stocks be pulyshed of the carpenter / *
and they be gilded and siluered / *
but they be false and can not speak / How think you have not your images
these properties? *
Their gods have goldyn crounys on *
their hedes from whom the prystes does take *
a way gold and silver and spend it on the^ self / *
They give also of it un to their strumpittes and deck their harlottes / *
and when they have takyn it a way from their harlottes / *
than deck they there with their gods again / wherefore know that they be no
gods. Be not all these things fulfilled on you? do not you take a way their
oblacions and there with maynteyne your pomp and pride / and deck also your
harlottes? *
say not nay for all the world will condemn you for opyn liars / *
the matter is so plain. *
Their gods have a septer like a man / and like a Judge of a land / but they
cane not slay him that offends them / where fore fere them not. Does not this
agree with your gods? Note how bold ye prophet is which dare crake with your
gods and says how that they can not hurt their enymys / where fore he
bids us that we shall not fere them / Now if you think that this be not
spokyn of your gods (not with stonding that none of these things they be
void of) go to the^ and ^rye but remember yt you cry a loud for they be very
thick of heryng or peraduentur they be gone forth attoune and occupide
Therefore I say cry and whope aloud / and bid them if they be gods or will
have any honor yt they will now avenge them self of their enymys / If they
cane do notyng / tha^ will we lay un to the^ this mock of ye profyt and will
not fere the^. *
They have a sword in their hand / and an axe / *
but they ca^ not deliver the^ self from batylle nor from *
theuys there fore tere the^ not / *
A ryghtwyse man is better that has none Imagys for he shall be fre from
obprobriusnes. *
How think you have not your gods all these tokyns? how many theuys have
you hangyd for robbyng of your gods? but your gods never sauyd the^ self
from theuys. Moreover / why make you so suer locks and so suer dorys if your
gods be abille to keep your gods? I think you fere not their running a way.
Fur theremore why keep you so grett bandoges / if your gods be abylle to save
their gods from theuys? But my think yt ba^doges be myghtyare thane your
gods and also you trust more to the^ / for they defend both you and your
gods. you du^me stocks where is all your reason? where is all your wit?
where is all your wisdu^? where is all your pollycy? where is all your
godly faith that you ought to have in the god of heuyn? Are you not a shamyd
thus grossly to disseue men? ye and with those things which you cane neither
defend with scriptur nor yet with any reason / but peradventure you will say
that ye prophet speaks here of idolles and not of Images. I answer / I pray
you what call you Idolu^? is it not as much as imago i^ latin which we call
i^ inglish an image but we will not vary for ye name let us go to ye propertis /
have not your Images all these propertis that the prophet lays to these
things which you call idols can you say nay? can you prove yt contrary? Does
not experience learn us that they be all won? Now what matter is yt what name
you give them when ye propertis and ye very thing is all won. Moreover the
prophet Dauyd does defyne an Idolle with these propertis / First it has yies
and can not se / yt has a nosse and can not smell / it has a might and can
not speak / yt has erys and ca^ not hear / it has hondes and can not feel it
has fete and can not goo. etc^-

Now which of all these propertis has not your Idollis? what will you make
now of the^ The prophet dauyd makes an Idolle of that thing / that has these
propertes and will you make a god and a helper of them? will you pray to them /
will you offer to them? will you run from place to place to seek them? There
is no distinccion / there is no subtylty that cane help you: for more reuerens
more service more honor More cultus duly may you not do to your Imagis than
the prophet would that we should do to Idollis for they be won in all propertis
and conditions. And as for your mirakels that you defend them by / they be but
elusyons of ye devil in ventyd of your own Imaginacion and contrary to the
word of god unto the great blasphemyng of the o^nipotent god of heaven / for
myrakyllis be never done of god that any man cane prove of suerty but all only
to the magnyfyynge and declaracion of his blessed word / As for all other
mirakillis may be suspected to be done of the deuell / by the sufferance of god
/ to the probacion of our faith and specially wha^ they be agenste the open
word of god / This may be proved by the wordis of moses / Deu. 13.
if there a rysse in ye myddis of the a prophet or ama^ that says I have seen
a vysyon / and shall tell the a fore a sign and a wonder / and that thing that
he told the do also come to pass / Now if this man say unto the let us go
and follow strange gods which thou knowyste not and let us serve the^ / thou
shall not here the prophet nor the dremers words / for god does prove you that
yt may be open whether you love him in all your heart and in all your solle or
not. Be not these wordis open agenst all manner of mirakellis? ye and agenste
prophettis whose prophecy is true and yet by cause he will draw the hearts
of the peopylle unto other thyngis by side god there fore shall he not be hard
/ your Imagis be not here exceptyd. Forthermore what signyfythe this yt god
wll have all our hearts and all our soul if god have all than can your
Images have no part But mark how god does prove our faith with such
myrakylles so yt he would yt neither huen nor hell / Saint nor mirakelles /
Prophet trwe nor false should draw our hartis from him or from his word / but
alonly to styck fast to him werfore lay for your Idolles what you cane / fyst
they be no godis / Secondarily they ca^ no mre do (if they do so much) but do
mirakilles an tell you a fore of those things that be too come / and yet all
this can not help for it is openly genste the word of god and we may not here
hem. Furtheremore against your Idolles will I ^tte the brasyn serpent of whom it
is written that yt did mirakylles so openly that no man can deny it / ye and
yt by the word of god which did also stand many hunderd years tylle the
people did to it so much as they now do to your gods / that is they did
offer sense and other oblacions there to and therefore was it distroyid. not
with stonding it was institutyd of god / and so be none of your idolles
wherefore mirakillis can not help. Also among the turks be myrakelles done as
they think / and yet that prouythe not their sect to be lawful I will tell
you of a mirakylle that is written in their law / On a sertyn time there was a
controversy by twene the prestes and ye religious men which of them should
have / the oblacions off the people / The prestes laid yt they ware best
worthy by cause they were ministers in the temple and seruantis to the gods and
night and day took pain for the people / The frears laid for them yt they
were the succession of all their holy fathers and by their prayers and merrytes
was the king and all the people kept / and the land defended from all evell
with many other things more / Br^uely this matter was deferryd of both parts
to the sentence of the king the which had thou^ht to have given sentens with
the prestes. but ^ha^ the friars knew yt / they came to the king and desyered
him that he would defer the sent^ns vij. days and see what the gods would
sh^we for them / The night a fore that ye king sh^lde give sentence / was he
compelled by nature t^ go to ye preuy which wha^ he ca^ there ye preuie b^ake
and he fell in and there was he crying by ye spac^ off an hour till he was so
weary yt he culde n^ more / and no man culde come to him for ye pallys ^as
lokkyd / Tha^ suddynly appeared unto him a relygius man with a glorius light
saing unto ^ym / Now where be they yt thou would have given sentence with all?
are not they well worthy of ye oblacions that can not help ye out of danger?
But now may thou se what we may do with the gods for the and all thy land /
and with this the king with out pain or hurt was taken out of the preuy and
laid again in his bed o^ he wist yt / and the day followyng gave he sentence
that the religious men should have the oblacions.

How thynk you was not here an open myrakylle? and was it not done on the king
the which had understanding and reason / it was an open matter when he was in
the preuye and ye preuye broken and he laid again in his bid with out any
hurt / this passed man's power / but what will you prove of this myrakylle? all
your gods to gether cane not do a more open myrakylle than this is.

But let us see what ye doctors say agenst your gods / Cleme^s writteth
these words / Libro. 5. ad Iaco.
we do honor vysible Images to the honor off the invisyble god / yt which is
a false thing but if you will honor ye image of god in doing well to man in
him shall you honor ye true image of god / where fore if you will truly honor
ye image of god / we will open yt thing unto you yt is off troth so that you
must do well un to man the which is made unto ye Image of god / give him honor
and reverence / Give him met whane he is hungery / Give him drink whane he is
thursty / Clothe him whane he is naked / serve him when he is syke / Give him
lodgeyng wha^ he is a stranger / and whane he is in preson mynyster too him
necessarys / this is the thing that shall be countyd to be geuyn god trewly.
what honor is this off god too run a bought folishlye to stony and woddy
Images and to honor as godis ydille and deed fygurs / and to dyspysse man in
whom is the very true Image of god. wherefore understand you that this is the
suggestion of the serpent that lorkythe with in / the which does make you
believe yt you be devout whane you do honor in sensyble things / And makes
you to believe that you be not wyckkyd when you hurt sensyble and reasonable
men. etc^.

How thynk you? does not this da^me the worsshyppyng of Imagys / ye though yt
be in ye honor of god. He shows you also that there is no another true Image
but man / which of you all goo a pylgrimage to that Image? which of you all
do offer to that Image which of you all do honor that Image? you londlepers /
you inventers of new gods / you Idolaters / what say you to this? how ca^ you
avoid this? is not this a greable with scrypturs? And yet this Image do you
dyspysse / This image cast you in preson / this Image do you stock and chain
/ and whyppe from town to tovne / with out any cause / This Image dies in the
streates a fore your doors for hunger and cold and you run to walsyngam and
to Ipsewyche with great pomp and pride to honor your deed shadows / yt were
better for you to burn those Idolles and to warm this true Image of god
there by / for this Image was made unto god wonly and all your dumme godis
ware made for this Images sake. wherefore it comes of the deuylle / that you
for sake this very true Image and lepe to your worm ete^ goods / ye you
have burnte meny a pooreman for spekyng agenst these du^me Idolles / but tell
me when all the Bishops in ynglond did vex or trubble any man for speking or
for doing / ye or for distroyyng this very true Image of god they had rather
dystroy it them self / tha^ it should be vndistroyd / Let ye kings books be
serched through out the Realm and there shall be no small number found of
these Imagys that be trubbled and vexed and cast in preson for tryfylles ye
and utterly undone by the bysshopes and by their prystes and yet will they be
the honourars of Images ye and that and to the honor of god and of al holy
saynctes / is not this agenst al reason / is it not agenst all wisdom? ye is yt
not agenst nature? and yet no man may tell yt.

Also the same doctoure in an other place / Cleme^s in eode^ libro
What thing is there so wykked and so unthankful? as to reseue a benyfyte of
god and to give thankys unto stocks and stonys / wherefore wake and understand
your health. etc^.

How thynk you are you not vnthankefulle unto god of whom you have reseuyd all
thing and for them you thank your worm etten gods? furthermore. S.
Augustine says / de vera re li. ca. vl^i.
Let us not love any vysyble spectakylles lest by arrynge from the verite /
and by loving shadows we be brought in to darkness / let us have no deuocio^
to our phantisis / it is better to have a true thing what so ever it be than
all manner of things that may be feigned at our own plesur. etc^ Be not your
Idolles visyble spectakillis? Be they any other things than shadows / and yet
you will love them and honor them / Answer to Saint Augustyn. you Infydelles
have not we a living god / and will you bring us from him to deed stockys?
Also Saint Hierome / Super Dau^*
Be it known un to the King. etc^. the propertyes of the words be to be
marked that he says / we will not worsshyppe thy gods nor yet honor thy
image for neither of both be come ye servants of god to do. etc^. here have
you that neither worshypyng nor honoring belongs to images.

But now to the worshypynge of saynctes / which has a greter shadow of
holiness than these dumme gods have / In primis you say yt saynctes must pray
for us and be medyators to god for us that by them we may be abylle to reseue
our peticion / this is Rychardes opinion de media villa / there cane not be a
thing inverted by the craffte of the devylle that may be a greter blasphemy
or more derogacion to christ and his blessed blood than this is / for if
saynctes be necessary to be mediators for us than is Christ vnsufficyent: for
philosophers did never put two causys where as won was suffycient / and if any
thing be given us of god for saynctes sakes than be not all things given us
for Christ's sake the which is planly agenst saint Paul saying / god for us
all has given his sone / Roma. 8.
and shall he not give us all things with him? let every christen man
judge what a blasphemy that this is. But let us prove that Christ is alonly
our medyator. S. Paul says / there is won medyator by twene god and man the
man Christ Ihesus the which has given him self for the redempcyon of all
men / mark that he says won medyator by twene god and man. where there is
but won there can not saynctes come in* Moreover saynctes be men / ergo they
must have a medyator for the^ selves / and than they can not be medyators for
other me^. Furthermore the medyator between god and man is called christ Jesus
/ now is there any saynct that has this name? if there be none that has the
name / than is there none that cane usurp this office / with out blasphemyng
of Christ. Furthermore he has redemyd us wonly with out the help of saynctes
/ and why shall he not be wonly mediator with out saints / is not redemption
the chief act of a medyator? Also the holygost says / he shall be called
Emanuel the which is as much to say as god with us / Esa. 7.
what is this God with us / is he with us but as won man is with an other? and
as my cote is with my back? nay / he is an other ways with us / That is to
redeem us / to save us to keep us / to defend us from all eville / ye and is
with us / that is he is on our side / he holds with us / he speaks for us /
he excusythe us / he makes our cause good / breuely he optenithe allething
for us. Of what saynct can this be spokyn? what do saynctes now for us? Also S.
Joan says / If a man do sin we have an advocate by the father Christ Jesus
/ 1. Joan. ^.
what is this he is our advocate to the father? and here be none assygnyd but
Christ Jesus / and by him have we wonly remyssyon of our sins

Now what shall saynctes obtain for us? what shall they desyer for us? if
our sins be remytted / than has the father of heuyn no dysplesur agenst us
/ what shall they than pray for us? Also Saint Paul says / The spret off
god makithe entercessio^ mightyly for us with myghtty desyers / yt ca^ not be
expressed with tongue. Mark how the sprete of god desyereth and prayth for us /
and that no man should rekken that we had need of other mediators he says that
he prayth myghttylly for us / and with great feruency that yt can not be
exprssed. Now is not he abylle to obtain all things for us and has taken
this office on him for us? yt were doughtles a great rebuke to him / that
saynctes should be set in his stead / and joined with him in his office as
though he were vnsufficie^t / you think to do saynctes a great honor whane
you make them gods / and set them in Christ's stead / but you can not do
them a greter dishonor nor displeasur / for they will be but saynctes / and
no gods ye and that by christ's help and not by their own. Roma. 8.
Also. S. Paul says / Christ syttyth on the right hond of ye father the
which does also pray for us / mark that he praythe for us / cane the father
of heaven deny any thing of his prayer? Does not he ask all things
necessary for us? And as scriptur says he is our wysdum / 1. Cor. 1.
he is our iustes / he is our satisfaccyon / and our redempcyon made of god.
Now what restythe for saynttes to ask? what will you desyer more than wysdum
/ justice sanctificacion / and redemption all these has Christ opteyned for
us / ye and he allonly there un to was ordained of god / which of all the
saynctes cane say that but he? and if all saynctes and all the world would
say the contrary / yet he him self stands fast agenste them all and
condemmeth them for liars and blasphemars saying / no man comes to the father
but by me / note these words. First he says / Johan. 14
no man. etc^. Ergo as meny as ever shall comme to the father of heaven be here
contained than adds he / but by me / be not all saynctes / all your feynyd
mediatores with merits and all other things clean excluded in this word /
but? wherefore it is plain that what so ever he be that makes any other
mediator or gothe abought by any menys seem yt never so holy but by christ
wonlye to come to the father of heaven / first he dyspysythe christ / and if he
dispyse christ he dyspysythe also his father which has allowed him wonly to be
our mediator and way to him as it is written I am the way wonly to the father
/ Johan. 14*
therefore let them be suer that seek any other way or any other mediator but
christ alonlye to heaven that they (acordynge to the word of the verite which
can not lie) shall never comme there / but as meny as trust in him wonly /
let them not dought but they shall not allonlye opteyne to comme to heaven but
also what so ever they desyer by side in his name acordynge to his own
promise and word which can not dysseue us / what so ever (says he) you ask
in my name the father shall give yt you. Mark these words / what so ever /
and yt we should run to no another he adds also / Johan. 1^
in my name. Here is nothing excluded / but all things frelye be given us /
and that for his names sake: not for no saynctes name / not for none of our
holiness or merits / but for christ's name / now what is it to run from this
swette promise of our most lovinge savior redemer and wonly mediator Jesus
christ to saynctes / to other works / but a plain and an euydent toke^ of
our infidelyte / of our vnthankefullenes / ye that we think him un true and
will not fullfylle his promysse / ye that he is not abylle to do yt and to
make him a liar and untrue in his word. Also. S. Paul says. He has given
his wonly sone for us / how cane yt be that he shall not give all things with
him? Mark he says with him and not with saynctes / he says all things and
not serten things / he that says all excludes not the totheake and leuythe
yt to. s. Appolyne. etc^. but he excludes nothing.

Now you infidelles and mystrusters of christ / what will you have of the
father of heaven? or what cane your hearts desyer that Christ is not abylle to
obtain for you? yff you believe him abylle / It is his office and there unto
wo^ly appointed of the father and none other / ye all other be excluded with
manifest scripturs. Moreover will you or be you se folyshe to ask a thing of
won that has yt not to give / nor can not give yt / ye has need of yt him
self / and leave him that has abundance / ye and that has made and open
proclamacyon that frelye with out gold or silver or any marchandysse will
give the self same thing so as meny as come and ask of him what so ever they
be / now the lord has not allonly godnes but he is all goodness him self /
Luc. ^8
and all saints have sinned and need of his godnes and he has made this
proclamacion by his blessed and everlasting word that who so ever comes un
to him shall have of his godnes abundantly / now will you leave him and goo to
the saynctes yt which if they eder had any goodness they reseued yt of the
father as. Iaco. 1.
S. James says all good gifts comme from the father of light / mark how
he says all good gifts. But here have you a dystynccion yt only god is good
of his own nature / and saynctes are good by receyvinge goodness of him /
well to do you a plesur I will a low your dystynccyon to be good / for of
it cane you make no more with all your subtyltye but that saynctes have no
more goodness than they have reseued. Now yt goodness that they have reseued was
for them self wonlye / ye and they cane give none of yt to you / for they
reseued yt not for you but for them self / ye and no more than was necessary
for them and that but allonly of mercy as it is open in Mathewe in the parable
of the fyve wysse virgyns and the.v. follyshe / where as the wysse virgyns had
not so much oylle to lend the folyshe virgyns as would kyndylle their lampys /
finallye they had nothing at all that they could spare them / and yet were
they wysse virgyns / and yet were they saynctes / and yet were they admytted to
enter in to heaven. Furthermore do you not openly agenst god whane you desyer
any thing of saynctes whether it be prosperity / welthe / health remission of
sins / or in aduersites co^solacions / or cu^fortes or any other thing seeing
yt scripture wonly knowlygyth all these things to be reseued of him / and that
he is ye wonly geuer of the^ / Psalm. 119.
ye and that all ye prophytes and fathers in all their tribulacio^ cryyd
allonly to him as David testifyth of him self in these words / when I am
troubled I will cry unto ye lord and he will help me / he cryyd not to no
saint neither yet desiered any saint to speak to god for him / but says I
will cry unto ye lord / ye and he doughttyd not yt he would not here him by
cause he was a man and a sinner but faithefully said he will help me / as he
testifyth in a another place sayng / Psalm. 120.
my help is of god yt has made heaven and earth. Now will you run from god and
ask of saints comfort prosperity / health or wealth or other thing seeing it
belongythe a lonly to god to give / seeing he alonly is the fountain and auctor
of all goodness and not saints which have no more but their part and yt that
is given un to them. Also our Master christ techyng all creaturs to pray
bydoythe them not to goo to any other thing / but allonly to the father of
heaven / he makythe no mention of saints / no not so much as to be a mean by
twene them and the father / but co^mandythe them that pray to pray them self
to the father / The which thing I dought not but he would have done if he
would that there should have been other medyatours or geuers of any goodness.
Moreover is not this a mad manner of prayer that men use to our lady / O our
father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name. etc^. Thus do you learn me^ to
mock our lady when you learn the^ to say our ladys sauter. you Infydelles
and mokkers both of god and man are you not a shamed of these open blasphemys?
Doubt you not (yff you call not for grace to the lord that you may a mend ye
and that shortly) but god shall straytly a venge this blasphemy on you / he
has suffered long and no dought but of his infynyte marcy / Not with
stondyng I will never believe that he will much longer suffer seeing yt he
has brought so graciously his glorious verite in to the world and that so
openly / and so clearly that you can not deny yt nor withstonde it neither by
reason nor by lerninge but your own consciences be confunded and marked with
hott yerens / not with stonding you persecute it by tyranny to the incresse of
your damnacion / our lord be merciful unto you. But now that you may be
known what you be whane you disseue ye people with these words fathers
fathers: holy doctors holy doctous I shall resyte sertyne of your fathers
and doctors saynges yt you may be known not allonly oppyn liars and
blasphemers of god and his blessed and eternal word / but also of his holy
saints and fathers un to whom he has reuelated by ye scripturs his verite.
August. de vera relig. cap. vlti.
First S. Augustine says these words / let us have no deuocio^ in honoring
of deed men / for if they lyuyd well they may not be countyd for such men as
to desyer such honors / but they will that god shall be honouryd of us by
whose lyghtnyng they reioysse that we are made companyons of there glory /
wherefore saints must be honouryd by followyng them / but not honouringe them
of devotion etc^. Be not these plain words? S. Augustyne was a father and a
doctoure / And he says yt saints will not be honored of us / but that god
shall be wonly honouryd Secondarylye we may follow their good living and so
honor them / but in nowyse to pray to the^ or honor them of devotion / It
follows in S. Augustyne where fore we do honor them by love or cheryte but
not by service / nor we bylde no te^pilles un to them / for they will not so
be honored of us / for they know well that we (if we be good) be the
tempilles of god / wherefore it is well wryttyn / that man was forbyddyn of ye
Angel to worship him but allonly to worsshyp won god under whom the angelle
was also a servant etc. Apoca. 19. and. 22.
Cane you desyer any playner words than these? we can no more do but love
saints of cheryte but in no wysse to serve them / we may also bylde no
tempilles to the honor of the^ / Mark also how he brings scripture for him
how the angelle of God wold^ not be honored of man / how cane you avoid this
sayng of S. Augustyn and his example of scripture? Also Chrisostomus says on
this text / Mat. 15. tom 6. ho. de profec. e^ange.
woman thy faith is grett / doste thou see this woman which was un worthy /
but by hare perseverance was made worthy? will thou learn also that we
praiynge un to God in our own persons do more profit than when other men do
pray for us / This woman did cry / and the dyscipilles came and prayed him yt
he would speed hare for she cryythe on us / but to them he answered I am not
sent but unto the sheep which are peryshed of the house of Israel. But when she
came hare self and did persevere cryyng and saying / yes lord / for the
whelps do ette the crummys that fall from their masters tabylles / Thane did
he give hare the benyfyte and said be yt unto the as thou will. Duste thou not
see how he did repelle hare whane other men prayed for hare? but whane she came
her self and cryyde / he did grant hare. Un to them he said I am not sent
but un to the sheep / But un to the woman he says be yt un to the as thou
will. etc^

Here you not plainly how we do sooner obtain our peticyon of God our own
self than by any other mydlers? mark also how the apostylles did pray for
this woman and they were repelled / Chri. To. 6. ho. de profectu eua^gelioru^.
and she was hard. Also the same doctor writteth these words / we have no
need of patrons a fore god / nor need of much prossys to speak fair un to
other men but though thou be a lone and want a patron / but prayst god by
thy self yet for all that shalt thou have thy desyer / God does not so
lightly gravnt whane other men pray for us / as whane we pray our self ye
though we be fulle of sins etc^ / be not these words plain / that we have
no need of patrons? but God hearyth us sooner when we pray in our own persons
/ than when othermen pray for us / wherefore they that make other mediators
than only Christ / does mustruste Christ and beleuithe that he is not
omnypotent God / nor mercyfulle lord / and there fore fly they unto this
sayncte and un to that saynct trusting to find more mercy at their hands than
they could find at Christ's / but a true Christen man leuythe his fantesye /
Exodus 20.
and remembereth these words of holy scryptur Hear thou man I am thy God /
and therefore he sets all his trust / all his confydens / all his believe
/ all his hope / All his heart on him wonly / and if he will have any thing
necessary to boddy or soul of him he askythe yt alonly as the prophet David
lernythe us sayng / I will pray un to the lord and in the morning thou shalt
here my voice / Psalm. 5
what is this in the morning but shortly / quycly thou art so mercyfulle that
thou will not prolonge the time but shortly here me / and therefore whane I am
in any dystresse of boddy or soul to the I call for delyuerance and trust to
obtain yt on the wonly / For thou lord / psalm. 4.
thou haste set me in thy hope wonly.

Thus does every good man pray and trust in god / for he takythe him not
allonly for his god but also for his mercyfulle god / ye and for his father
which will deny him nothing / but contrary wisse do the infidelles and the
faynyd christenmen / for they mistruste him ad rekkyn him to be a tyrant and a
terrible and a ferfulle Judge / which lokythe for much intercession / and that
regardithe parsons / and therefore run they hither and thither / to seek an
other mediator / to seek an other helper / to seek a another diliue^ar than
christ: for with him be they not satisfysyd / ye they rekkyn him to be so proud
and so statly and so cruelle and so hye that they dare not speak first to him
nor desyer him for they clearly mystruste him / that is the sum there of. And
for that cause seek they to this saint and to that saynct / and desyer of won
Rychys of an other health / of won they will be holpyn to heuyn / of an other
they will be delyueryd from hell Of won they will have frendsshyp in this
world / of an other long lyffe / of won they will be sauyd from syknes / of
an other they will be made wholle / and all this is by cause they mistrust
Christ and rekkyn that he is either not abylle / or that he will not obtain
these things for them / This is the very ground of their hearts / let them
lie with their mouthis what they will / and of this are they compellyd to fly
from christ. Is not this making of meny gods? S. Paul says that in
covytusnes is Idolatry / by cause that man's heart is of his gods / how much
more is here Idolatry where as man's faith / hope and trust is set so much
of creaturs Trevth it is that saynctes be holy / and worthy to be belovyd in
christ and for christ / but yet be they but creaturs / and no gods. I love
them as well as you do and praysse and magnyfy them / but wherefore? by cause
they have christ in the^ which is the auctor of all goodness which if he were a
way / I would spitte at them and disspisse them / But I do not make them Christ
(that is my savior / my redemer / my co^forter my trust and my hope) by cause
that Christ of his mercy and of his grace dwells in them / but I seek alonly
to him that has made the^ holy and has also allonly power both me and all
men like wysse to make.

Where fore dear brethern / if you will be Christ's / make him alonly your
mediator and your intercessor to the father of heuyn / and all things that
you desyer / desyer them in his name wonly Make him first your friend and than
have you all saynctes on your side / For they can not chosse but be your
friends. wherefore set all your trust hope and confydence in Christ wonly and
dyrecte all your desyers / all your peticions / all your prayers un to
him wonly. And as for saints you shall love them / favor them and magnyfy
them and praysse them for gods sake and to gods honor / and where they lived
well after Christ's word there in shall you follow them / But in no wysse
shall you believe / hope / or trust in them / or make any prayers un to them
or desyer any peticyon off them: nor their living shall be any rule to live
by forther tha^ they followed the word of Christ / for you be called christen
men of christ and not of saynctes.

But now will I answer too their carnal reasons / First they have a law whose
words be these Christen men do not call worshupfull Images gods / nor they do
not serve them as gods / nor thy set no hope of their salvation in them / nor
they do not look for off them the Judgment that is too come / But they do
worship them / and affectually pray un to the^ in remembrans and recordacion of
the first fruits but they do not serve them nor yet any other creature with
godly honor. etc^.

Let every Christen man consider well in his conscyens the words of this law
/ and call also too remembrance what god is him self / that is too say how
omnipotent he is / how lyberalle he is / how merciful he is how gracyous he
is un to us / And than I think he shall well perseue / that this decre is
neither made with faith / with learning / nor yet with reason / but an opyn
blaspemye agenst god and a great mystrustynge of our mercyfulle Master Christ
Jesus / Breuely there is nothing / but an hepe of blind and vnfaythfulle
words in ventyd too be gyle sympylle men there by

To the first word venerabiles / What faith / what learning / what reason
will that Images should be Judged worthy veneracyon (this does the lattyn
word / venerabiles sygnyfye) seeing they be but Deffe / dumme and deed / what
reason is yt than too call them venerabiles? Master Doctor Rydley will say
that no man is so made too worsshyp and too honor the stock and the stone
/ and yet his own law callythe them venerabiles / that is as much too say as
worthy too be worsshiped and honored / Call you them won thing by name and
rekken them un worthy in deed? It follows / Christen men call them no gods /
what need these words? All the world knowythe that they be no gods in deed
/ But than why call you them venerabiles?

Forther more I would know of all my Masters the lawyers why they be such
blasphemers of god / such infydelles / and such mortalle enymys un to god /
as to suffer / ye and to compel sympylle men / to give too those stocks and
stonys such exteryor honor as belongythe wonly too god seeing you call them
no gods? What makes yt matter for the name so long as you give them the
very thing? Assygne you what exteryor worsshyppynge and honourynge belongythe
to god / or that we may do or cane do too god / and I will prove that ye
compelle men to give that same too your stocks and stonys / and yet you
think your self suffycyently dyschargyd / by cause that men call them no
goods. It follows / They set no hope in them. Than what need men too pray
un to them? what need me^ to ask peticyons off them? what need men to offer
unto the^. what need men to vow to the^. what need men to run to them
barefottyd an bareleggyd / and to kiss them and lycke them? do they ask yt
thing of the^ which they have no hope to reseue by them / than do they mock
them / It follows but they pray un to them and worsshypp them / how think
you by this? you say they be no gods and yet men pray unto them and worsshyp
them / add to this that the lattyn word sygnifith as much as to ask
forgeuenes of them / and fullye and affectuallye to pray to them / if this
stond with faith / and with the honor of god / let everye Christen man judge
/ but how stondeth yt with your decre where in you call them no gods? this
is as much to say as you be very hypocrytes and dyssemblers with god and man
/ for you say won thing in words and compelle the people to do the contrary
in deeds / that is to honor them as gods / is not this contrary to these
words of scripture / thou shalt honor thy lord god and serve him wonly.
Mark the holy ghost says thou shalt serve god wonly. Matt. 4.
Here is the self lattyn word / adorare / that your decre has / scripture
will yt shall all wonly be given to god / and you will give yt to your
worsshypfulle images / mark also the occasion that our Master Christ spoke
these words / the deuylle requyered that he should fall dovne and honor him
/ he requyered no faith / nor no hope on him nor yet that he should make any
prayers or desyer any peticion of him or lycke or kiss his foot / or make any
oblacion to him / but allonly to faulle dovne / and so with exterior service to
honor him / but our master said that that belongs alonly to god and neither
to the devil nor yet to your worsshyppfulle images / now say of your
conscience do not you that same thing to your stocks and stonys / that the
devylle rerequyred of our master Christ? how cane you avoid this? but now
comes your gloss with a distinccion and will learn our Master christ how
that he shall honor the deuyle and excusse him with an idylle and a damnable
distinccio^ whose words be these / there is cultus latrie / Glossa de conse.
Di. 3. c. venerabiles.
which includes.iij. things in him: love / multitude of sacrifice / and
veneracyon this belongs wonly to god says he / there is an other
worsshippinge which is called dulia / and this has but won thing in him that
is veneracion / and it has neither love nor multitude of sacrifice in yt and
this belongs to all creatures. etc^. What be these but an hepe of ydylle
words with out any sentens invented of the devylle to dysseue simple men by.
Here say you that cultus latrie which includes love / multitude of sacrifice /
and veneracion belongs to god wonly / tell me of your conscience are you not
a shamed off these words? Fere you not the vengeance off god? that thus mock
and tryfylle both with god and man? There cane be nothing more age^ste you
than these words be / for first do you not love your images and your
saints? Secondarilye do you not offer to them? call you that no sacryfyce?
ye it is so much that you cane ha^ge no more on them / Thyrdly do not you give
veneracion unto them ye and that with all your hearts / or else be you
hypocrites and dyssemblars / so yt you give to your stocks and stones cultum
latrie / which by your own distynccyon be longs to god wonly / how cane you
now avoid idolatry? Now to the second part of your dystynccion / you say yt
you do to saynctes and to all creaturs the worshuppyng of dulya / which is
with out love / and with out the multitude of sacrifice / what call you this?
what mean you by this? what worshyppyng is this that is with out love / and
with out sacrifice / is not this open hipocrisy to honor a thing outwardly
and neither to love yt nor to favor it inwardly / nor yet to offer any
sacrifice un to it / Matt. 27.
this is nothing else but open mokkynge and I may well compare you unto the
wykkyd Iuys that chrouched and kneled unto christ / but they did yt neither of
love nor favor but of mokkage as you do honor your saints and images.
This comes all ways to them that will mock and tryfylle with gods holy
word / that whane they think to a void yt with a damnable distynccion / than
is yt most agenste them so that all christen men may see / that the hand of
god is here. De media v^la 4. sent
Also an other bald reason you have which is of Master Rychard / if saints
whane they were here and not confyrmed in grace did of their cheryte pray for
us / ergo now must they pray much more seeing they are now confermed in
cheryte. etc^.

Is not this a goodly baulde reason to cast at a bisshoppes cure? How cane he
prove this? what scripture has he for him? I hear well his carnalle reason
but I hear no probacion I will make him like reason. The saynctes whane they
were here did of their cheryte clothe naked men and feed the hungery and gave
drink to the thursty / and vysytted them that were in preson / ergo much more
now for they be confyrmed in cheryte and these be deeds of cherite.

Likewise. S. Paul whane he was here did of his cherite wryght pystylles to
declare the veryte / ergo now must he much more wryght / so that where a fore
he wrotte but won pystylle now must he at the lest write three / or else he is
not confyrmed in cheryte / and I think he did never a greter deed of cherite /
than now to write a pistle and to declare his own pystilles for all the world
is at variaunce / for understanding of them. you blind gydes who has learned
you to declare where in the cherite of saynctes does stand? who has given
you auctorite to give a deed of cherite unto saints that scripture does not
give / wherefore is it a deed of cherite for won to pray for an other? is
there any other cause than that the holy ghost so declared it in his word /
wherefore that is cherite in this lyffe that the word of god byddeth you do
and as for the works that cherite shall have in an other lyffe yt belongs
not to you to judge forther than the word of god.

Also you have an other reason / god shows myrakles in this place and in that
place to the honouringe of this saynct and that saint / ergo we must likewise
honor them. I answer as to your myrakles though I have answered to them
before / yet will I add this un to yt / that god is no god of supersticion nor
that favors won place more than an other / or that has any affection to this
place more than to that / wherefore this is your supersticion invented of ye
devylle / for god will neither be honored in ye mountain nor yet in
Iherusalem / Johan. 4
but in men's hearts / and as to your myrakles the great gods diana did also
myrakles as you may read in scriptur / Act. 19.
consider hare honor yt scriptur speaks of / and compare it to ye honor of
your images and you may se they do agree. Furthermore Apollo / Castor /
Aesculapius and such other did also great miracles as storys do make mention /
and also many men which were both wysse well learned and also men of as
great reputacion and honor as you be / ye and men of great holiness do bear
wyttnes of the same / ergo by this reason we must also honor them. Also an
other reason you have out of Job / Co^verte thy self un to some of the saynctes
/ Job. 5.
of this you conclude yt we must pray unto saynctes. I answer of this you may
conclude that you be blind and dulle assys and vnlernyd stocks / peruerters /
terars / rentars of holy scripture / I pray you what saints did the old
fathers know a fore Christ's cummynge? whom did they rekke^ to be in heaven
before Christ's assencion? why did they desyer so sore his cummyng if they
believed that they should have assended up to heaven? But this is the sentence
of that place / Elephas reproved Job and says that he is not gods servant /
and therefore god ponysshed him says he / and to prove this he bids Job
call to memory all holymen and servants of god and rekken won if he cane
among them all whom god did so ponishe / wherefore he concludes that Job is
not the servant of god but a folishe man (which in scriptur is the enymye of
god) whom god shall slay in his wrath / this is the sentence of that place.

Psalm. 150
Fynallye you have an other reason / you shall praise god in his saints / ergo
saynctes must be honored. I answer is not this a good consequente? I must
praysse god in berys and apys ergo berys and apys must be worsshypped? add
that it follows in the text you must praysse god in timbrelles in orgens and
in pypys / Ergo after your consequent Timbrelles orgens and pypes must be
worshypped / but if you were learned in scripturs / you should find an other
sentence in the holy psalm than this is for the very true text is Laudate
dominum in sanctitate sua / Preyse god in his holiness / but let us grant that
he says preysse god in his saints do not you know that scripturs say
blissed is god in all his gifts / out of this can not follow that we shall
worsshyp and pray to godis gifts but god shall be praysyd and honored in all
his gifts / as in saint man and Angel. A another reason you have of a
similitude Like as a man can not come to the speech of a king but that he must
have serten mediators (as dukes Erlys and such men as be in favor between him
and ye king that may intret his matter / So lykewysse a fore god / I answer /
you infydellis and mystrusters of god / what will you make of god / will you
make him a fleshely and a carnal stock fulle of passions and off affecions?
Unto a mortal prince you make mediators be cause he knew not your heart and
by cause he is more affeccionat to won man tha^ to an other / and by cause he
Judges after ye syghte of his yie / and after the percyalnes and affection of
his heart / But so does not god / but alonly of mere marcy and grace / But to
your similitude / you can not have no dukes to speak for you except you give
them rewards or except they have a carnal affeccion to you / Ergo by your
similitude you most like wysse do too saints.

But Saint Ambrose answers clearly to this damnable reason of youres Saying
/ ad. to. c. 1.
Men are vonte to use this miserable excusacio^ / that by these things may we
come to god as we may come to the king by Erlys I answer we do covme unto
the king by the menys of dukes and Earls by cause that the king is a man and
knows not to whom he may commit the commen welthe / but un to god (from
whom nothing cane be hid / he knows all men's merits) we need no
spokeseman nor no mediator but alonlye a devoute mind. etc^. Here are you
clearly answered of saynct Ambrose to your carnalle reason. De consec Dis. 3.
c. prolatum.
Item an other reason out off your law / that images be unto unlearned men that
same thing that letters and wryttynges be unto them that be learned / that they
may there by learn what they ought to follow. etc^.

If your images be no more to unlearned men than wryttynges be to learned men
ergo they may no more do to them thane learned men do to their letters /
would you suffer learned men to come and knele / and offer to my book and set
up candels a fore yt and make vowys to come yearlye there unto? and to desyer
peticions a fore my book of those saints that be written therein? Se how your
own example makes agenste you and all thing that I cane bring. wherefore if
there be any grace in you / or if there be any shame in you of the world / for
christ's sake leve of this false learning and collorynge of ydolatrie. For you
do not wonlye dysseue your simple brethern / but you do also blaspheme the in
mortalle god of heaven / which doughtles will avenge shortly this rebuke on you
yff you do not amend whosse violence and might you are not abylle to
withstond / wherefore I exhort you in the blessed name of Christ Ihesus that
you repent in time / and take apone you to learn the verite / which is / how
god is wonly to be honored / and wonlye to be sacrifysed un to / he is wonly
to be prayed unto / of him wonly must our peticions be asked / yt is he wonly
that gives welthe and prosperyte / and he wonly must deliver and comfort us
in all aduersytes / 1. Timo. 1.
and he wonly must help us out of all dystresse unto whom as. S. Paul
says be allonly glory and honor for ever. Amen.

Now most excelent and nobylle prince I have here after the poor gift that
god has given me set out unto your grace serten articles which though they
seem at the first syghtte to be new yet have I proved them openly with ye
everlasting word of god and that not wrong nor wrested after my lyghtt brain
/ but after the exposicion of clearkly doctoures ye and that of the oldest and
of the best. wherefore most excelent prince most humbly and mekly I beseke
your grace / that I may find so great in dyfferencye at your graces hand as
that the bysshoppes shall not condemn this book after the manner of their old
tyranny / except they cane with open scriptures and with holy doctores /
refelle yt as I have proved yt.

But I would yt should plese your grace to call them all a fore you / and to
command as meny as will condemn this book every won of the^ seuerallye with
out others counsel to wryght their cause why they will condemn yt and ye
scripturs where by they will condemn it and to bring them all to your
grace / and your grace may judge by twene both partys. I do not doubt but
they will bring your grace marvelous probacions and such as were never hard
and if.iij. of them agree in one tale (if they be devyded) let me dye for yt /
and that your grace shall well se / the father of heaven and his most
mercyfulle son Jesus Christ keep your grace in honor to his pleasure and
glory. Amen.

Finis.
I Have added Christen reader a table to this book to help thy memory and
that thou may the more easelye find that thou desire. wherein I have also
set out the most notable saynges of doctoures and of the popes laws which
are alleged in the book before / so that this table is in a manner a sum and
short rehershall of the hole book. But harken dear reader / this one thing I
do require off the / that thou will compare these sayings of doctoures /
holy fathers and of the popes own law unto the sayings of the pope and
bysshopes yt be now / and unto the practice of this present world / and then
give sentence thy self how they do agree. If they accord then conclude
boldlye that this is the same church that was in their days: but yff they
agree not / then may thou suspecte that yt is amysse and that the devell
has transfygured him self in too an angel of light and that they are his
mynysters which notwithstondynge have faschyoned the^ selves as though they
were the mynysters of rightwisnes whose end shall be according to their deeds.

ALen doctor Ale^ expounds scriptur.C.v Ambrose says / ye tears and
prayers be ye wepons of prestes / and yt otherwise they may not nor ought not
resyst xv. Ambrose says / they are iustefied frelye / for they doing nothing
nor nothing deserving alonly by faith are iustefied by the gift of god.xli
Ambrose says / It was so decreyd of god / that after the law / he should
require unto salvation alonlye the faith of grace / he says that they be
blessed of whom god has determed with out labor / with out all manner of
obseruaccio^ / allonly by faith that they shall be iustefyed before god.
Blessed are they whose sins be forgeuen Clearlye they are blessed / unto who^
with out labor / or with out any work their iniquittyes be remitted and
their sins covered / and no manner of works required of the^ / but allonly
that they should believe. xliij. Ambrose says / sins be forgeuen by the
word of god / whose interpretar is the deaco^ lxxvi Ambrose says to the
emperor Theodosius: How shat thou lift up thy hands out of the which does
yet drop v^rightwise blood? how shall thou with those hands receive the
body of god? with what boldness will thou receive in to thy mouth the cup
of the precious blood / saying that through the wodnesse of thy words so
great blood is shed wrongfullye. C.xxix. Ambrose condemninge the vain opinion
of the ignorant people as concerning yt they thought it expedient to have
mediatoures and spokysme^ between god and them / writes in this manner. Men are
wont to use this miserable excusacio^ that by these things we may come to
god / as we may come to the king by Earls I answer we do come to ye king by
ye means off dukes and Earls / because the king is a man and knows not to
whom he may committee the come^ wealth / but unto god / from whom nothing can be
hyd for he knows all me^nes merits) we need no spokesman nor no mediator /
but allonlye a devout mind. etc^. Fol. C.li. Antychristes cast is to warn
men of heretykes and traytoures because no man should suspecte him and in the
mean ceason while they look for other comes he in and plays both the
heretyke and also the traytoure..v Athanasius says / there are two manner of
faythes / one is iustifyinge / as that of the which it is spoken / thy faith
has saved the: a another is called the gift of god wherbye miracles be done /
of the which it is written / if you have faith as a grain of mustarde seed lv
Athanasius says. It is to your co^de^nacion yt you go to law one with a
another wherefore do you not rather suffer wrong xxvi. Athanasius says / the
apostle would not committee to one bisshope a whole Ilonde or co^tre / but he
did enjoin that every city should have his propre pastor or curate because
ye people might be the better taught. xxviij Athanasius says / Now does the
apostle plainly show yt faith alonlye has the virtue in him to iustefie: and
brings abacuc saying of faith (and not of the law) shall a ryghtwyse man
live. He adds well before god / for before man paradue^ture they shall be
rekened rightwyse yt stycke to the law but not a fore god. etc^. xlv.
Athanasius says / If thou will yt thy children shall be obedient unto ye use
them to the word off god. But thou shall not say that it belongs allonlye
too religyous men too study scripture / but rather yt belongs to every
Christen man / specyallye to him that is wropped in the busynesses off this
world / and so much the more because he has more need of help / for he is
wropped in the troubles of this world. Therefore it is greatly to thy prosite
that thy children should both hear and also read holy scriptures / for of them
shall thy learn this commandment / honor thy father and thy mother. etc^.
Fo. 107. Augustyn says / the saboth is commanded to be observed figuratyuely
/ and not by bodily ydelnes that is that we cease from vices and concupiscences
and not from bodily labor. fo. 24 Austyne says / those same works yt be
done before faith / though they seem unto me^ laudable are yet but vain / and I
do judge them as great strength and swyfte runnynge out of the way. wherefore
let no man count his good works before faith. where as faith is not there is
no good work / the intencion makes a good work but faith does guide the
entencyon. etc^ xlv. Augustyn says / we do gether that a man can not be
justified by ye precepts of good living that is / not by ye law of works /
but by ye law of faith: not by the letter but by the sprete not by ye meritis
of works / but by fre grace.xlvi Augustyn says / S. Paul affirms yt a man
may be iustefied by faith with out any works going before iustificacio^ / but
when a man is iustefied by faith / how ca^ he but work well though yt he before
working nothing rightwisely is now come to ye iustificacion of faith / not by
merytes of good works but by ye grace of god / ye which grace in him now can
not be idle seeing that now through love he works well. And if he depart out
of this world after yt he believes / ye iustificacyon of faith abides by him
/ not by his works goinge a fore iustificacio^ (for by his merits came he not
unto yt iustificacio^ but by grace) nor by his works yt follow iustificacio^ /
for he is not suffered to live in this life / wherefore Paul and James are not
contrary / for paul speaks of works yt goo before faith / and James
speaks of the works that follow the iustificacion of faith 53. Augustayne
expoundinge the text of ye apostle Roma. 2. the doars of the law must be
justified says / so must yt be understand that we may know yt they can no
another wise be the doars of ye law except they be first justified / not that
iustificacion belongs to the doars but ye iustificacio^ does precede al manner
of doing.54 Austayne says / of christ is ye church made fair / first was she
filthy in sins / afterward by pardon and by grace was she made fair.59.
Augustyne says / The holy church are we / but I do not say we as one should
say we that be here alonlye that hear me now / but as many as be here
faithful christen men in this church that is to say in this city / As many
as be in this regyon / as many as be beyounde the sea. etc^ 60. Austayne says
/ The whole church says forgive us lord our sins / wherefore she has
spots and wrincles: but by knowleginge of them her wrincles be extended and
stretched out / by knowleginge her spots are washed away. The church
abides in prayer that she might be cleansed by knowleginge of her sins as
long as we live here so stands it and when we shall depart out of this body
all such things be forgiven to everye man. wherefore by this mean ye church of
god is (in ye tresures of god) with out spotte and wrincle: And therefore here
do we not live with out sin / but we shall pass from hence with out sin
etc^. lxi. Austyne says / ye private counsels of everye province must give
place to the full counsels which be gathered of al christe^dom: and also those
full counsels often times may be amended by ye full counsels that come after
etc^. lxiiij Austyne says yt the true church of christ which is scattered
through out the world has learned of her master christ not to persecute nor to
resyst but to suffer lxvij Austayne says yt must be called a key wherbye ye
hardness of our hearts are opened unto faith and wherbye the secretnes of
minds are made manifest A keye it is (says he) the which does both open the
conscience to the knowledge of sin / and also includes / grace unto the
holesomnes of the everlasting misterye lxxi / Austyne says / these keys has
he given to ye church yt what she byndeth in earth shall be bond in heaven and
what she loses in earth shall be losed in heaven / that is to say / who so ever
does not believe yt his sins be forgeuen him in the church / they be not
forgeuen him: buth he that does believe and a verte him self from his sins
being with in ye church / by ye same faith and amandement is made hole lxxiiii
Austyne says / that he keys were not given to peter only but indifferentlye
un to all the apostles and to the whole church lxxv. Austyne says / the church
which is founded and grounded in christ / of him has receyved in Peter the
keys of heaven. that is to say / power to bind and lose lxxv Austyne says
upon this text many sins are forgeuen the / he prophesied of men that be
to come: there were men to come that would say / I forgive sins / I iustifye
/ I sanctifye / I make hole so many as I baptize. wherefore ye Jews did
better understand ye remission of sins than heretykes do / for ye Jews
said / what man is this yt forgeueth sins? and heretics say I forgive / I
make clean. I sanctifye. 78. Austyne as touching what a man can do of his
own strength says / lest any man should suppose that the branche of him
self could bring forth at the lest ways some fruit / therefore says he not
with out me can ye do a little / but with out me can you do nothing therefore
whether yt be little or much with out him can it not be done with out whom is
nothing done. One of two things must the branch needs do / either abide in
the vine or else burn in the fire / if it be not in the vine than is it in the
fire. etc^. lxxxij. Austyne says / what goodness can he do that is lost /
except that he be delivered from his myserye? Can he do any good by his
frewyl? god forbid. For man evylle using his frewylle did both lose him
self and also his frewylle. And as a man being alive does kylle him self and
when he has killed him self / he can not make him self alyve again: so like
wise wha^ we do sin by fre will and sin has the victory / than is
frewylle clean lost. For of whom a man is overcome un to him must he be
servaunte / doutles this sentence is of Peter the apostle / the which seeing
that it is true / I pray you what manner of fredome can abonde servant have /
except it be when it pleases him to sin etc^. lxxxiij. Austyne says / O
cursed frewill with out grace we have experience what frewill ca^ do with out
grace and there fore are we miserable behold man was made good / and by his
frewil was he made an evil man when shall an ewill man by his frewill make a man
good? he being good could not keep him self good and now that he is evil
shall he make him self good? when he was good he kept not him self good / and
now that he is evil shall he say I make my self good? etc^. 83. Austyne
says he that fedeth with out christ / fed^th agenst him 85. Austi. says on
this text if you mortefye ye flesh etc^. Thou will say that can my will do yt
can mi frewill do. what will what manner of frewill? except that he gyde the
thou fallest / except he lift the up thou lie still / how can thou than do
it by thy sprete / seeing that the apostle says / As many as be led by ye
sprete of god / be ye childern of god / will thou do of thy self? will thou be
led of thine own self to mortefye the deeds of ye flesh? what will it profit
ye (for if thou be not voluptuous with ye epicure thou shall be proud with ye
stoikes) whether thou bean epicure or a stoike? Thou salt not be among ye
children of god for they yt be gyded of the sprete of god be ye children of god
/ not they yt live after their own flesh / not they yt live after their own
spirit / not they yt be led of their own sprete / but as many as be led of ye
sprete of god / they be ye children of god / But here a man will say / Ergo
than are we ruled and we do not rule / I answer: thou both rulest and art
ruled / but than do thou well rule if thou be ruled of the good sprete /
utterly if thou want the sprete of god thou can do no good: Thou do
truly with out his help by thy frewyl but yt is but evil done / unto that is
thy will (which is called frewill) and by evell doing is she made a damnable
bond servant. when I say with out the help of god thou doste nothing / I
understand by yt no good thing / for to do evyl thou have frewill with out
the help of god though that be no fredome. Wherefore you shall know that so
do you goodness if the helpinge sprete be your gyder / the which if he be
absent can do no good at all / etc^. lxxxv. Austyne says / if man do perceive
that in the commandementes is any thing impossible or else to hard / let him
not remain in him self / but let him run to god his help the which has
given his commandimentes for that intent that our desyer might be sturred up
and that he might give help lxxxvij. Austayne says / The pelagianes think yt
they know a wonders thing wha^ they say / God will not command that thing
the which he knows yt is i^possible for man to do / every man knows this /
but therefore commands he certain things that we can not do / because we
might know what thing we ought to ask of him / faith is she which by prayer
optayneth that thing that the law commands. Breuelye he that says if thou will thou may keep my commaundimentes / In the same book a little after says
/ he shall give me kepinge in mi mouth / Plain it is that we may keep the
commaundme^tes if we will / but because out will is prepared of god / of him
must it be asked that we may so much will / as will suffice us to do them:
troth it is yt we will when we will / but he makes us to will that thing yt
is good lxxxvij Austyne says ye pelagianes say yt they grant how ye grace
does help every man's good purposse / but not yt he gives the love of virtue
to him yt strives agenste it. This thing do they say as though man of him
self with out ye help of god has a good purpose and a good mind un to virtue
/ by yt which merit precedinge a fore / he is worthy to be helped of the
grace of god yt follows after. Doutles ye grace yt follows does help ye good
purposse of man / but ye good purposse should never have been if grace had not
preceded. And though yt the good study of man when it begins is helped of
grace / yet did it never begin with out grace lxxxviij xcj. Austyne says /
ye grace which is given of ye largenes of god prevelye in to men's hearts /
can not be dispysed of no manner of hard heart. For therefore is it given yt the
hardness of the heart should be taken away. wherefore when ye father is hard
with in and does learn yt we must come to his son / than takes he away
our stonye heart and gives us a fleshye heart / and by these means he makes
us the children of promise and the vessels of mercy which he has prepared
to glory. But wherefore does he not learn all men to come to christ? Because
that those yt he lerneth / he lerneth of mercy / and those that he lerneth not
of his judgment does he not learn them. etc^. lxxxix Austyne says / the law
was given yt man might find him self / and not to make his sickness hole / but
that by his preaching the sickness encresed / the physicyon might be sought.
wherefore the law thretenynge and not fulfyllynge that thing that he
commands makes a man to be underneath him. But the law is good if a man use
yt well. By the law to know our sickness and to seek gods help to help us
xcj. Austyne says / the disputacion of them is vain which defend the
prescience of god agenst ye grace of god / which say that we were chosen a
fore the making of the world because that he knew a fore that we should be
good not be cause he should make us good: but Christ / that says you have not
chosyn me / says not that. For if he did therefore chose us because that he
knew a fore that we should be good / than must he also know before that we
should first have chosyn him. etc^. xcvj Austyne says / my brothren read
holy scripture in yt which you shall find what you ought to hold and what
you ought to fly. what is a man reputed with out lernyng / what is he? Is he
not a sheep or a goote? Is he not an ox or an ass? Is he any better tha^ an
horse or a mule the which has no understanding. etc^. C.vij. Austyne upon
this text Matthewe.xxiij. the scribes and pharisees sytte in Moses sete. etc^.
says / by syttinge in the chair is understand learning of the law of god /
and therefore god does teach by them: but if they will teach their own doctrine
/ hear it not / do it not / for such men seek that that is theirs and not
christ's. etc^ C.xviij. Austine (upon ye words of ye apostle / touch not
handel not. etc^. Col. 2) says / because that those me^ by such obseruacions
were led from ye verite by the which they were made fre / whereof yt is spoken
/ the veryte shall delyver you Ioa^. viij It is a shame (says he) and
inconuenie^t / and far from the noblenes of your lybertye (seeing you be the
body of Christ) to be disceaved with shadows and to be judged as sinners if
you despise to observe those things. wherefore let no man overcome you (seeing
you are the body of christ) that will seem to be meke in heart in the holiness
of aungelles and bringinge in things which he has not seen. C.xxj. Austyne
says / Saying that we be made of soul and body / as long as we lyve in this
temporal life we must use to the norisshinge of this life / these temporalle
goods. Therefore must we of that part that belongs to this liffe / be
subject unto powers / that is / un to men that do minister wordlye things /
with some honor but as concerning that part wherbye we believe in god and be
called unto his kingdom we ought not to be subject un to any man / that
will perverte the same thing in us that has pleased god to give us to
eternal life. 121. Austyne says / let us not love any vysyble spectacles
lest by erringe from the verite and by loving shadows we be brought in to
darkness let us have no devocion unto our fantasies It is better to have a
true thing what so ever yt be / than all manner of things that may be feigned
at our pleasure 141 Austyne says / let us have no devotion in honouringe of
deed men. For if they lyved well / they may not be counted for such men as to
desire such honors / but they will yt god should be honored of us by whose
lightninge they rejoice that we are made companions of their glory. wherefore
saints must be honored by folowinge them / but not honouringe them of
devocyon. 145.

Barnarde says / I do abhor what so ever thing is of me / except
paradventure that that be mine that God has made me his. By grace has he
iustefyed me frelye / and by that has he delyvered me from the bondage of
sin. Thou have not chosen me (says christ) but I have chosen the: nor I
found no merits in the yt might move me to chose the but I prevented al thy
merits. wherefore thus by faith have I married the unto me and not by the works
of the law. I have married ye also in justice / but not in the justice of the
law / but in that justice which is of faith. 46 Barnarde says / that those
rulers of ye church which go so gorgiouslye arrayed of our lords gods as
deacons / Archedeacons / bisshopes and archebisshopes they call them selves
the minysters of Christ but they serve antichrist lxviij Barnarde says / what
shall we say is this allo^lye all the merit of frewill that he does alonlye
consent? ye doutles. Not that the same consent in the which is all his merit
is not of god / wha^ we can neither think (the which is less than to consent)
any thing of our self as though we were sufficient of our self / these
words be not mine but the appostles the which gives unto god and not to his
frewille / all manner of thing that can be good / that is to say to think /
to will or to perform. etc^. lxxxi^ Chrysostom says / the appostle would not
that a whole contre should be permytted unto one man / but enjoined to every
man his cure / to have cure and charge of one church only xxviij Chrysostom
says / the key is the word and ye knowledge of scriptures wherbye the gate of
veryte is opened unto men lxxiiij Chrysostom says the keyberars are preastes
unto whom is committed the word to teach and to interpretate scriptures lxxvj
Chrysostom says I say boldlye that the bishopes and prelates of the church
may have no thing but meat and drink and cloth. xxviij lxxix. Chrisostom^
speakinge against the presumpcions of prelates says / behold I se men that have
no true sense of holy scripture / ye thy understand nothing at all thereof
/ and to pass over many things (for I am a shamed to call the^ mad men
(trifela^s and wrangelars) they be such as know not whate they say nor of
what thing they speak / but alonlye be they mighty and bold to make laws
and to curse and condemn those things of the which they know nothing at
all. etc^. lxxx Chrysostom says / I beseech you that you will often times come
hither / and that you will diligently here the lesson of holy scripture / and
not alonlye when you be here / but also take in your hands when you be at
whom the godly Bible / and receave the thing there in with great study for
therebye shall you have great vauntage C.vij Chrysostom says / which of
you all that be here (if it were required) could say one psalm with out the
book or any other part of holy scripture / not one doutelesse / but this is
not alonlye the worst but that you be so slow and remiss unto spiritual
things and unto develyshnesse you are hotter than any fire. But me^ will
defend this myscheve with this excuse / I am no religious man / I have a wife
and children and a house to care for. This is the excuse wherewith you do (as
it were with a pestilencye) corrupt all things / for you do reken that the
study of holy scripture belongs allonlye unto religious men / when they be
much more necessary un to you than unto them. C.viij. Chrysostom says on
this text / woman thy faith is great. Do thou se this woman which was
unworthy but by her perseueraunce was made worthy / will thou learn also
that we prayenge unto god in our own persons do more profit than when other
men do pray for us: This woman did cry and the disciples came and prayed him
that he would speed her for she cries on us / but to them he answered / I am
not sent but unto the sheep which are perished of the house of Israel. But
when she came her self and did persever cryenge and saying ye^ lord / for the
whelps do eat the crummes yt faule from their masters tables / the^ did he
give her ye benefyte and said be it unto the as thou will. Do thou not se
how he did repel her when other men prayed for her? But when she came her
self and cried / he did grant her Unto them he said I am not sent but un to
the sheep of Israel / but unto the woman he sayethe / be it unto the as thou will. etc^. Fol. C.xlv Chrysostom says / we have no need of patrons a fore
god / nor need of much process to speak fair unto other men / but though
thou be alone and want a pratrone and pray god by thy self / yet for all
that shall thou have thy desire / god does not so lightlye grant when other
men pray for us as when me pray for our self ye though we be full of sins.
C.xlv. Church what it is and who be thereof and wherbye men may know her.
lviij Church how a man may know the true church. xlv. Ciprian says / how do we
teach or how can we provoke men to shed their blood for the confession of
Christ's name if we do deny them the blood of christ when they shall go to
battle? or how dare we able them unto the victory off marterdome if we do not
first by right admytte them to drink the cup of our lord in the
congregation. etc^. C.xxix Cipria^ says / what thing so ever it be yt is
ordained by man's madness / wherbye ye ordinance of god is violated / it is
whoredom / it is of the devil / it is sacrilege. wherefore fly from such
co^tagiousnes of men and avoyde their words as a canker and as a pestilence.
etc^. C.xxxj Clement says / we do honor visible images to the honor of the
invisible god / the which is a false thing: but if you will honor the image
of god in doyinge well to man / in him shall you honor the true image of god.
wherefore if you will truly honor the image of god we will open that thing
unto you which is of truth / so that you must do well to man the which is made
unto the image of god. Give him honor and reverence. Give him meat when he
is hungrye. Give him drink wha^ he is thristye: cloth him when he is naked /
serve him when he is a stranger / and when he is in preson minister unto him
necessaryes this is ye thing that shall be counted to be given god truly. What
honoringe of god is this to run about to stonye and woddye images and to
honor as gods idle and deed figures / and to despise man in whom is the very
true image of god? wherefore understand you that this is the suggestion of the
serpent that lorketh with in / the which does make you believe that you be
devoute when you do honor insensyble things / and makes you to believe that
you be not wiked whane you hurt sensible and reasonable men. etc^. Fo. C.xl.

xxiiij Hierom says / It is sin unto you that you do agenst the commandment

peace / ye though it were with the loss of your temporal goods. wherefore
do you not rather suffer wrong? where as you ought by the commandment of the
gospel and by the example of the lord patiently to suffer / there do you the
contrary / and not alonlye not suffer but you do wrong un to them that do no
wrong. xxvi Hierom says upon this text / I shall give the the keis of
heaven. etc^. This place the bysshopes and prestes not vnderstonginge have
usurped unto them some what of the pharisees pride / so that they think that
they may condemn innocents and lose them that be giltye / when before god

thing in this life that does preserve a wise man and does persuade him to
abide with a good will in the oppressyons and trauldoms of this world / I do
