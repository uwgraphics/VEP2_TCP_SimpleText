The Reasons For which the most Jllustrious and most potent Prince, and LORD,
LORD Gustavus Adolphus,

King of the Svvethens, Goths and Vandals, great Prince of Finland, Duke of
Esthonia and Carelia, and Lord of Ingria, was at length Forced to March with
an army into Germany.

Printed according to the copy of Stralsound. Anno 1630.

IT is an ancient proverb, that no man is able to enjoy peace, any longer,
then it pleases his neighbor: how true this is his Ma: off Swethen has, to
his great dammadg proved, in these years, and does yet daily: for hombeit, it
was his cheefecare and endeavor, in all the time of his Reign, to keep
inviolable Frindship with all his neighbors, and especially, with the States
of Germany; that peace and tranquillity might flourish on every side, and that
trade, Comerce, and all oath repeaceable indevours, might be exercized, to the
mutual good off all Nations: yet could he obtain nothing more, then that, by
some haters of the public peace, after that they had wasted almost all Germany
with fire and sword, greater snares were laid, from year to year, against
his security. his Ma: was advertised long ago, and that, not of a few States of
Germany, to provide for himself more maturely, while this flame was yet
spreading it self in Germany, and that he should not think, they would be more
favorable or frindly to him, if they were admitted to aproach nearer; but that
he would then, presently, take Arms, come into Germany, and with common
forces, quench the common burning, being assured, that his own cause was then
in hand, when kis neighbors house was a burning. neither was there then
wanting to his Ma: either excellent occasion, his subjects inviting him, or
just cause, his oppressed friends and Allies so earnestly requiring aid and
succor. but still hoping, that at lenth, they would prove more equitable, then
so impotently to insult, over their harmles Neighbors, measuring their
manners, according to his own nature, he chose rather to committ his own
security for a while, to the goodness of god and an innocent Conscience, then
rashly therein to attempt any thing.

But when in the year 1626. by reason of his own war, which passed between
him and the King and common wealth of Pole, he was marching into Prussia, a
Province of the Kingdom off Pole, perceiving more narrowly, what he might
promise himself, of those foresaid wasters and spoilers of Germany, he found
his friends admonitions to be so far, from being vain, that the nearer his
enimyes approached to these Baltic provinces of Germany, so manny the more and
greater occasions of war he perceived to be sown by them daily, even against
him: for in the first place, violating the law of Nations, they intercepted his
Ma. letters sent to the Prince of Transylvania, opened them, and of malice
against his Ma. published them with a fained interpretation, casting withal
his messenger into prison; then also, howbeit there was oftentimes no small
hope, of redressing and, composing of the long continued co^troversy, betwixt
Swethen and Polland, by frindly treaties, the Commissaries of both kingdoms
meeting from year to year, yet these enimyes of common peace, caused, by
their reiterated messengers and letters to Polland, that no peace should be
made with Swethen, until such time, as they had accomplished their
determinations in the Roman Impire; putting the Polonians in hope, the States
of Germany being once ranged in order, they should then have them no slow
aiders and assisters to subdue Swethen.

And to the end they might effectuat, in deed, what by word they promised: and
that so far as in them lay, they might both deprive Swethen of all means, and
strengthen the Pole, they did not only prohibit all exportation of Soldiers
and Arms, out of Germany, to the King off Swethen, leaving withal the same
free unto the Polonians, then his enimyes; but also, when this seemed a small
matter, and they perceived, notwithstanding hereof, that abundance off
soldiers did flock, to the most illustrious King off Sweth. not only from
other parts, but also (and that against their wills) out of Germany it Self,
the year next following, 1627 they sent the Duke off Holsatia against his Ma.
with ^ great Army, into Prussia, and that not, under his own, or under the
Poles; but under the Colors off the Emperor of Rome himselff.

Neither content with this kostility; but that also they might utterly seclude
the kingdom off Sweth: from all League of society with mankind: they did not
only wrongfully spoil the innocent subjects of his Ma. arriving at the coast
off Germ. for Commerce, taking their goods by for^e, and confiscating their
schipps: but also, they did mainely effectuat that, at Lubick and the rest of
the towns off the vandalls, by their Scouts, sent out, in show, that they
might restrain trading to these towns only; but in very deed, that they
might withdraw the same, from the subjects off the kingdom of Swethen, and that
by this occasion, they might gather together schipps, and a Navy, by which,
they might belch out this venom, conceaved in their minds, upon the Baltic sea
it self; as in the year next following, they ^id manifestly schew, by the
monstrows titles off Generality off the sea coasts, and by taking in
possession, as well the Land places and Fortifications, as the Coasts, and
have^s of Mechlinburgh and Pomer, with the acts ensewing thereon.

Let any man, who is able, Judge, that all these things perhaps ought to have
bin tolerated, and for avoiding off curiosity in other men's affairs, to have
bin passed by in patience, while they kept them-selves as yet, upon the
Continent, opposite to Sweth: yet certainly, after they were extended to the sea
it selff, by choosing the Haven off the Sound for a receipt of their Piracy; by
how much the more this was done, to the great prejudice off all the States,
who, by any necessity what soever, did depend upon this Sea; so much the les
ought it to have bin tolerated by his Ma. off Sweth: especially, seeing the
just protection off this sea was off old, peculiar, to the Kings off Sweth.

Therefore, so manny injuries also being added to the former advertizement off
Friends, when his Ma. (being now so much the more wary) in the spring off the
year, 1628. was again passing over to Prussia, being careful off nothing,
more, then that he might remedy these incommodities, by some honest means; it
fell out that the Ambassadors off the town off Stralsound did come unto his
Ma. in Prussia; who did heavily complain, that, allthough their harmless
city, had committed nothing, either against the Roman Imperour, or against the
Impire it selff, nor against any State off the Impire, for which it was so
far, that it was at any time Cited, or Accused, or convicted, or condemned;
that even by an Emperial decree, it was declared innocent, and secured off
withdrawing off the Army, which besiedged it: yet such was ye iniquity off that
noisome army; that, vilipending their innocence, neglecting the laws and
constitutions, off the Empire, contemning the Contract, made, with those off
Pomer at, Arnhem, and not regarding manny other Covenants, made at diverse
times, (by all which it might seem, they were sinceerely secured) neither
considering the great sommes off money, unjustly exacted, and paid; with gifts
and presents; violating the very sanctity, both off religious and common peace:
it did first, wast the Neighboring villages off the City, it did build diverse
fortes, upon the territories off the town, it did fortify the I Will of Benholm,
lying near upon the haven, to the prejudice of the town; after it had taken
it, by treachery, without any denunciation of enmity: it seized upon all
passages; from the continent, to the I Will off Rugg, and from the town to the
continent, and back, from the continent to the town, it did vex the Citticens,
with diverse ridiculous treaties, and having exhausted them by great tribute, it
chardged them also with Garrisons, and so, demanded the haven it self, with
their schipps and munition: and at lenth, all these being denied them, by their
privileged liberty, it did press the town it selff with a strait Siedge, and
did persecute it, most unworthily, to the very last, with fire and sword.
Whenas therefore, the Emperors decrees, did here effectuat nothing; the most
Illustrious Duke off Pomer, would not help them; when they were esteemed, as
left of all the society off the Hanse towns: according to the Law, and custom
off Nations, by favor off their privileges, by example off their Ancestors,
being compelled, to implore the aid off a Foreign Power, until that sudden
tempest off war, should leave raging; they did accept, for a while, the
Garrisons off the most Illustrious King off Denmark, as most ready to repel
the suddennes off the first assault: yet, least that schould turn to their
future prejudice, as if they had associated themselves, with the Emperors
enemies; at last they found no more equitable, and present remedy, then to
commit their oppressed liberty, to the tuition, off the most Illustrious King
off Swethen, as to a newtrall, and friendly King.

The most illustrious King off Sweth: therefore, Considering, in the first
place, that they could promise themselves, no more favor, from so insatiable
attemps, off an army, noted with so many hostilities; and next, marking, that
the desires off this afflicted city, were grounded, upon divine and humane
laws; as also, considering that bond off observance, vicinity, common religion,
liberty and commerce, by which that City was allway adicted, both to his
Ancestors, the most Illustrious Kings, and Kingdom of Sweth: and to himselff:
and lastly, what danger it should breed, not only to himselff and the kingdom
off Sweth) but also, to all his neighbors, if in this haven, any nest of
Piraticall excursion were settled, by the private ambition of any whatsoever: he
could no longer refuse, by any, either means or equity, for the benefit off
his Neighbors and friends, as also, off his own, and off the public and
common security (in the mean time) to succor and releve the oppressed, who so
earnestly entreated his help, comfort and Council. By which his intention,
Though this was effectuated, that the Imperial Injunctions did keep their own
authority, and the Baltic sea should be made secure for all Nations, who have
any interest therein, and that the town of Stralsovnd, by reason of the
friendly intervention of his Ma. being freed from the Garrisons, off the most
illustrious King off Denmark (as then hostile) should be kept, both to its own
liberty, and to the Empire of Rome, as the League, made with the town
concerning the same, does yet clearly demo^strate: Notwithstanding, it was
never a whit the more obtained, that those perturbers of peace, should yet
remit any thing of their hostile attempts and purposes, but by occasion theroff
they waxed more hot, in seeking the destruction thereof, both by Land and Sea:
for finding themselves to be frustrate of that haven, they set upon the haven
of Wissmar and others: neither being content with their own ships, they called
from Danswijck, the Navy of the enimys of the kingdom of Sweth: into their
society, and they began, so to annoy the sea near adioining, that his Ma. was
at length forced (if he would have the sea, and Commerce safe) to keep them
also enclosed there by his Navy (and that, not without great expense and
dammadg) until that, that year should at length be expired securely in some
kind.

Yet notwithstanding, that the most Illustrious king off Sweth: might not
herefore in any kind remit his constant and perpetual care for the peace, and
common quietness of these Nations; but rather that he might try all ways and
means, to com to a friendly transaction: when he understood that a treaty of
peace was instituted at Lubeck betwixt the Roman Emperor and the king of
Denmark, in the beginning of the year 1629. he thought it expedient, to send
his Ambassadors also thither in opportune time, that they might both accommodat
this matter of the town of Stralsound, and compose all other Ielousies, which
were bred in these years, and that also (if they could help any thing therein)
by their mediation they might promove the treaty it selff to the wished end:
for thus he made account with himself, seeing that by occasion off that war,
which passed between the Roman Emperor, and the king off Denmark, many
suchlike Iealousies seemed to have bin bredd, that neither peace could be
concluded with the king off Sweth: Stralsound being excluded, neither could
that town be bound to any Conditions, it self not being comprehended in the
Treaty, by reason of the mutual contracts, agreed upon with that City
concerning that matter.

But howbeit the most Illustrious king off Denmark did thankfully admit the
Coming of the said Embassage; neither was the same with less courtesy and
dece^cie desired by letters from the other party; yet such was the humanity,
wherewith he was requited, that his solemn Embassage was not only not admitted,
or at least thought worthy off any answer, by letter; but also with great
indignity repulsed, and commanded, to keep not only from the town off Lubeck,
but also from the whole territory of Germany, upon hazard and threatening of
extremity.

Which only indignity, though in the Account off all Nations, it be allway
esteemed worthy of most just revenge, and there seemed no cause to remain, why
more rough remedies, should be any longer abstayned from: yet seeing the
Deputies of the Emperor did at Length (in March, after that they of Sweth:
were recaled into the Kingdom again) acknowledge the letters of the kings
Ambassadg, by an Answer by letter, by which, as by way of excuse, they would
seem to mollify the iniquity of the former sentence; his Ma. also, in the mean
time, esteemed the same to have proceeded rather from some evil Councellers,
then from public Council; neither did he yet suffer it to be such, as might
seem to be sufficient, yea even joined with the rest, to Committ his mutual
States to a just war, especially seeing the said deputies did withal signify,
that they had no power to treat with any other then the king of Denmark, yet
they knew certainly, that if the matter were yet referred, either to the
Emperor himselff, or to the Duke of Fridland, they should receive an answer,
which might give them content.

It might now seem an unworthy thing, to expose his patience any longer to
such ridiculous proceedings, it having already been wronged so many ways: it
being also very doubtful, whither, or how, the matter might be related by the
party offended, to the imperour (with whom heretofore, no such like
communication had been usual, to his Ma.) all ways being prohibited in the
whole Roman Empire, and the treaty of Lubec drawing so near an end: yet
notwithstanding, that no labor might be omitted for the desired public
tranquillity, and that no difficulty might be any hinderance thereunto, all
contrary considerations being laid aside, when the matter could not be related
to the Emperor himself, his Ma. was at lenth, by the illustrous counsel of the
Kingdom off Swethen induced, presently in the month off April, not only to
write to the Electorall convention, as being the chief prop off the Roman
Empire, to which, these proceedings with foreign kings, were thought to be most
displeasing, and to sue for opportune remedies; but also to give consent, that
a deputy, should be withal sent from the counsel, to the general of the
troops himself, who by his presence might try, whither those controversies,
which seemed to be bred betwixt the mutual armies, might not be taken away by
the Convention of the same; whereupon his Mas. Chamberlane the Illustrious L.
Steno Bielke L. Baron, was presently sent to Kroker, with adjoined power, that,
if he found the mynds of the contrary party inclinable to peace, he should
constitute a stilstand of arms for Stralsound, while that farther preparatories
of treating being made, more commissioners might Follow, who might refer the
whole business to a full transaction. But, when he, in the beginning of the
spring aryved at Stralsound, and found the mynds of the adverse party, and the
whole face of the matter changed to the worse, and that the former hostilities,
were not only not taken away, but also augmented with fresh hostilities from
day to day; as also Stralsound again to be assaulted, with diverse onsets, all
the havens of the coast to be armed, for to pray upon the Swetian sea; and
which is the greatest of all iniquities, that a complete army was again
privilie sent to Prussia, without any denunciation of war, and that under the
Emperors own Marchall off the forces of Arnheimbia. this change did indeed,
stay him from proceeding any farther, as it was fit; yet notwistanding, that he
might in some measure discharge his commission; he wrote to the Duke of
Fridla^d, for what causes he was dispatched, and having protested against the
iniquity of that army, that was sent over, he desired that both it, and all
other hostilities might be stayed, if the answer off the deputies of Lubec
might other ways seem to be sincere: But the Duke of Fridla^d was so far,
aither from recalling the army, or showing any readiness to treat: with greater
mocking, he confirmed his subdeputies answers to be merely scoffing,
contending, that for this cause chiefly these soldiers could not be recalled,
because the Emperor had so many forces, that off necessity he behooved, to
disburden himselff off that army off arnheimbia, and therefore, he, not without
cause, sent it to his friend the King of Pole, against Swethen; as the
authentike letters do yet show; neither would he again answer any thing else
to any purpose, to the reiterated desires off the Ambassador; but caused the
said army to hasten its journey; which also, the whole last summer, did use such
bitterness off fight in Prussia, against the King and Kingdom off Swethen; that,
vules God, the Just revenger off iniquity, had made the recompense, off the
attemps off their wicked intension to light upon their own heads, no small
danger was like to have happened, both to the most Illustrious King, and
Kingdom off Swethen, and to all his Mas. Friends.

Can any man doubt therefore any longer, whither the most Illustrious King off
Swethen had sufficient cause, to move him, (all cogitations off peace laid
aside) long ago to have taken arms, and prepared himself for war, for the
defense, off him, and his. But there was yet one thing restand, which seemed
yet a little to hinder the speedy taking off arms (to wit) the expectation of
an answer to the Kings letters, from the Electorall convention, and the
intervention off the most Illustrious King off Denmarck, who, at the persuasion
off his Royal Ma. had from the last winter, even till now, begun to urge the
matter to treaties: for certanly, so long as any sufficient reparation off
damages and injuries, and provision for the security off his neighbors might
be wrought by treaty, his Ma. was never so covetous off revenge, but that, for
the zeal he bears to the common cause, and publict quietness, he would
willingly have suffered the matter to have been ended, rather by treaty, then
arms.

But seeing, that, from the beginning of April, in this year 1630. when there
was a day appointed for a convention at Dantsik in Prussia, unto this very
month of June, there is no signification of treaty made, by the party
offender, to the Commissarie of the party offended, there present, and
declaring by letters to Dantsik, his readiness and power to ^reate; how
sincerely the publict peace is desired, it is easy hereby to be Judged,
especially seeing, their scoffings, not only of former times, but also after
they had dispatched their Commissaries to Dantsik (by possessing themselves of
all fortified places and passages in Pomer, and preparing themselves more
eagerly to war, then heretofore) do plainly advertise, with what security,
any confidence may be put in such like treaties.

As for the Electorall convention; it might indeed have ^one much in that
matter, and his Royal Ma. persuaded himself, it would so have done, if the
States of the Empire, ^ad obtained the fredom of their ancient liberty, and
if the ^ower of evel willers had not taken such root therein, that ^t seemed,
to reject all internal remedy. they of the convention did also, in their
answer (which was in the late month of April conveyed to Stocholme) praise
the peaceable intentions, and proffered transaction of the most Illustrious
King of Swethen, offering Withal reciprocal frendschip on their part. but
seeing they did not so much as ^n a word, touch the remedies of the injuries
done, which the Kings letters, did chiefly requires did they not leave it
necessary for his Ma. to provide opportune remedies for himself.

Wherefore seeing so many, and weighty injuries ar really done to his Royal Ma.
his letters intercepted, and opened: his subjects, servants and soudiers
spoiled, and carried away into sclavery; trade, naturally common, interdicted;
the pole, his Mas. enemy, so often dissuaded from peace; and a reasonable army
led out into Prussia, for the ruinating of his Mas. Kingdom off Swethen. again
also not granting the King off Swethen, so much, as safe passage, yea, his
Friends, neighbors, and kindred (for malice toward him) oppressed, spoiled off
their dominions, and only not altogether extirpated, the suers for peace
(contrary to the custom off barbarians) ignominiously rejected; and at last, a
hostile army twice sent against his Ma. and that without any cause, or pretext?
Do not all these, yea each off them (by consent off all Nations, by persuasion
off reason, nature it self instigating thereto) deserve a most due revenge,
except due reparation do interceed. seeing so many threatenings, so great
preparations, so many divices, ar as yet manifested, to the reproach off all
the balthike havens, and off the very sea it self, by which, all both designs,
deeds and determinations, seem every where, both by sea and land, to conspire
for his Mas. ruin? do they not cast upon him (though vwilling) the right of
defense, that at least, according to the custom of war, and by the law off
all nations, he may procure the moderation off a blameles protection? seeing, he
having tried all the ways off law, no more equitable remedies ar granted? yea
seeing hostility is every where offered; does not the very law of nature
require, that force be repelled by force.

Since therefore there rests no other mean to procure safety, then that his
Ma. according to God, do help the security off himself and his, by arms; he
thought good by these, tot let the Christian wordle Judge, by what merit of
himself, and how sore against his will, he is redacted to these extremeties. it
is true, the defense only of the city of Stralsound, is pretended for the
ambition of most avaricious men: but how they them selves, by inferring off so
many former hostilities, and how, afterward (as it is said) love off the common
security, and so many reasons, have provoked his Royal Ma. these have
expressed, to the good off the Roman Empire it self.

If at any other time, he had aided the enemies off the Emperor, or the Roman
Empire, or made any leauge with their enemies against the^, or at least put any
other advice or counsel in execution to their prejudice; no man might wonder at
their diffidence, and retaliation of some kind of revenge flowing from hence?
Now, seeing such has always be^e the constancy off his peaceable
determination, that he ^ath not only kept inviolated Freindship and neutralitie
during all this German war; but has neither before, nor after the same, given
any Just pretext, of offense; he can ^ot, but, with most just greeff complain
before all the word^e, off so great an indignity.

Wherefore, as his Royal Ma. does ptotest, that these his ^rmes, are not as yet
prepared, to any prejudice off the Roman ^mpire (with which he has no
inimitie) but only to the ^rotection off himself, and his, until such time, as
his Friends and neighbors be put in the same case, in the which all ^he
neighborhood, has before this war, peaceably flourished so long time; and
until chiefly the city off Stralsound, the balthik sea, and the Kingdom of
Swethen may promise unto themselves hereafter, more certan security: so he
makes no doubt, but that the impartial reader, or ^he very safety of
Nations, will improve and detest so inquitable proceedings off the contrary
party, as they have ^eserved; and he does certanly hope, that all equitable
Germans and all the Christian wordle, will favor this his innocence, and Just
cause of taking arms, aiming at the lawful staying off so unjust persecution.

FINIS.
