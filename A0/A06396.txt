The two kind Lovers: OR,
The Maidens resolution and will,
To be like her true Lover still.
To a dainty new tune.


TWo lovely Lovers,
walking all alone,
The Female to the Male,
was making pitious moan:
Saying, if thou will go, Love,
let me go with thee,
Because I cannot live,
without thy company.
Be thou my Master,
I Will be thy trusty Page,
To wait on thee
in thy weary Pilgrimage.
So shall I still
enjoy thy* lovely presence,
In which alone
consists my earthly essence.
Be thou the Sun,
I Will be the beams so bright,
Be thou the Moon.
I Will be the lightest night:
Be thou Aurora,
the usher of the day,
I will be the pearly dew,
upon the flowers gay.
Be thou the Rose,
thy smell I will assume,
And yield a sweet
odiferous perfume:
Be thou the Rainbow,
Il(...) colors many,
(...) cloud,
(...) weather rainy.
Be thou the Lion,
I Will be the Lioness:
Be thou the servant,
I Will be the Mistrese:
Be thou the Porpentine,
and I Will be the quill,
That wheresoever thou go:
I may be with thee still.
Be thou the Turtle;
and I will be thy Mate,
And if thou die,
my life I Will ever hate:
Be thou the nimble Fairy.
that trips upon the ground,
And I will be the circle,
where thou may dance aroud.
Be thou the Swan,
I Will be the bubling river:
Be thou the gift,
and I will be the giver:
Be thou the chaste Diana,
and I will be as chaste;
Be thou the Time,
I Will be the hours past.
Be thou the Ship,
I Will be the surging Seas.
That shall transport my Love,
where he does please:
Be thou the Neptune,
I Will be the triple Mace,
Be thou the iocund Hunter,
I Will be the Dear in chase.
The second part.
To the same tune.


BE thou the Shepherd,
I Will be the Shepherdess,
To sport with thee
in joy and happiness:
I will be the Marygold,
if thou will be the Sun:
Be thou the Friar,
and I will be the Nun.
I will be the Pelican,
and thou shall be the young,
I Will spend my blood,
to succor thee from wrong:
Be thou the Gardner,
and I will be the flowers,
That thou may make me grow
with fruitful showers.
Be thou the Falconer,
the Falcon I will be,
To yield delight
and pleasure unto thee:
Be thou the Lantern,
I will be the light,
To lead thee to thy fancy
every darkesome night.
Be thou the Captain,
I Will be the Soldier stout,
And help in danger
still to bear thee out:
Be thou the lovely Elm,
and I will be the Uine,
In sweet concordance,
to sympathize and twine.
Be thou the Pilot,
I Will be the Sea-mans Card,
I Will be the Tailor,
and thou shall be my yard:
Be than the Weauer,
and I Will the shuttle be,
Be thou the Fruterer,
and I will be the Tree.
Be thou the Blacksmith,
I will be the Forge:
Be thou the Water-man,
and I will be the Barge:
Be thou the Broker,
and I will be the Pawn,
Be thou the Paresite,
and I will learn to fawn.
These lovely Lovers
being thus combined,
Most equally agreed
both in heart and mind.
Accursed may they be,
who seek to part these
Whom Love and nature
did to love ordain.
I wish all young men,
that constant are in love,
To find out a woman
that will so loyal prove,
And to all honest Maidens,
in heart I wish the same,
That Cupids laws
may be deuoyde of blame.
