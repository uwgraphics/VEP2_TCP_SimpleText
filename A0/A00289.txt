A VERY LIVELY PORTRAYTVRE OF THE MOST REVEREND ARCHBISHOPS, THE RIGHT
REVEREND Bs. OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND:

Set forth in XX. irrefragable positions, concerning their Authority, power,
and practice, as they only are our Diocesan Lord Bishops, so grounded upon
Scripture, Reason, and Experience, by evident demonstrative practices, as their
troublesome opposites, may clearly see, how greatly they are deceived in all
these.

A Labor undertaken for the peace of all GODS people, and for a just
condemnation of al those, that cause division, and offenses, contrary to the
Doctrine and Discipline of CHRIST'S CHURCH.

Printed in the Year, 1640.

THE NAME of Bishop is found in the New Testament, so as the controversy is
not about the name, whether one may be called a Bishop, nor whether Bishops in
the true sense, have been in the Church from the Apostles days, for this is
fully agreed upon.

But the positions following, and here handled, are such as have been much
controverted, but now so clearly manifest, that every indifferent and
impartial judicious Reader, may discernt plainly on which side the truth is.

POSITION 1. That Bishops jure Divino, are Superiors to other Ministers.
1. BEcause our Savior made several degrees in the ministry, which the
Apostle mentions, Ephesians. 4. 11. Yet in the same degree, he set none over
another; not one Apostle over another, not one Evangelist over another; (...)
not one Elder or Bishop over another.

2. Because the Apostle in reckoning up the dignities. in the Ministry from
Christ mentions no Bishops, as degrees in the ministry differing from the
rest, but Apostles, (...), Evangeliste which were extraordinary, then Pasters,
and Teachers ordinary, Ephesians. 4 11.

3. Because the name of Bishops, is given only to They have the same name.
those who are called Eld^, Act, (...) 28. Tit, 1. 5. 7. Now Elders were all of
equal Authority. Such the Ap^stles (...), and more the on^ in every City.
Act. 14. 23. and had charge given ^ot one over ^ther, but over the fl^ck, over
the which the holy (...) had made them Overseers O^ Bishops, Act. 20. (...).

4. The Apostle places Bishops only before (...), Ph^l. I. 1. I Tim. 3. 1. 8.
but no where before Elders, as Superiors to them.

5. The osfice and quality of a Bishop described (...), The (...) on the some.
that which equally and alike agrees to all teaching Elders. 1 Timothy 3. 1. 2.
7. Tit. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. and not to a special function in superiority before
an Elder. For Titus was appointed to ordain Elders, and the Apostle tells
him, what a (...) a Bishop, meaning an Elder, should b^, as making an Elder,
and Bishop one, and the same. It cannot be proved by S^riptura, that in the
A^stles days, Elders and Bishops, were degrees one ov^r another, nor by
History 200. years after that they were distinguished by degrees.

6. Because such as (...) Elders, were next to the Apostles, in the Council at
(...), and sat with them, as next to them, Acts 15. 23. Bishops here were
none, except included within the name of Elders, and so all one.

7. The double honor which Saint Paul speaks of, T^ ^nour and ^ard the same.
he allows it to teaching Elders, 1 Timothy 5. 17. which duty of teaching
Bishops affect not, and yet claim double honor.

8. Because these Elders, Acts 20. 17. came to be They ^ad on^ and the same
charge over the flock.
called Bishops, not in respect of any superiority they had one over another,
but to mind them of their watchfulness and care over their flock, in respect
of which Acts 20. 28.
flock, and not in respect of their fellow Ministers, they 1. Pet. 5. 2.
were called by Saint P^l, (who first g^ue them that title) Ov^seers, or
Bishops, Acts 20. 28.

9. Because Tim^ie and Titus, from whom they would derive the superiority of
Bishop^ ^ver Elders, were Euangel^s, 2 Timothy 4. 5. a dignity above other
Churches, Offic^s, Eld^s, O^ Bis^s, or P^stors, (all one) and (...). Ephesians. 4.
11. now why (...) of (...) higher degree, should be made Bis^ps, and so put in
a lower for me, wa^th (...) persuade the reunto.

10. Because the Postscripts to the second Epistl^ to Tim. and that to Ti^, are
worthy of no credit in this case, to prove Tim. and Tit. Bis^ps.

For these be no Scriptura, nor of divine authority, but Many (...) ter the
epi^les were written.
added by some private uncertain S^ribe, and so bring of humane authority they
c^nnot stablish Tim. and Tit. Bishops jure divi^, who by divine authority were
(...). See the unbi^ of Tim. and Tit.
The vanity of alleging these, (...), are solidly by other confuted, and not
answered.

11. Because the consent of the Learned is fully against this superiority of a
Bishop, to wit, to be above an Elder, or Presbyter in degree, (...) divi^, but
were all one, and the difference came by an humane consti^tion.

And yet here may be produced against them.

1. The Canon Law, which tells ^s, that superior^ty Page 117.

(...); fourth Council at Car^hage. 2. The coun^ell of (...) and B^il (...) it

of this judgment with us. 4. Some great Papists, (...), Hug^ Cardi^: ^^ Bish^
of Civil, G^rg. (...), hold their authority to be by positive Law, and came in
after the Apo^les days.
The Ancients alleged for this superiority, speak but of their own times,
long after the Ap^les days: or ^lse they judged of the times before by a
mi^ke, that ^^ in their days, which was nothing (...) 200. years a^r Chri^.

12. Because Bis^ (...) of S^int (...) in T. and Tit. (...). (...) 168.
(...) (...) his dignity, and ^owledged (...) that the Superiority of Bishops
over Ministers, was (...) of all (...) of the word of Go^: and founded upon the
only politic (...) of (...).

Lastly, (...) Doctor (...) is hold to (...), that our (...)-(...) and Bish^

(...); and therefore must Bis^s be (...) over other Ministers? (...) may know,
if he will that Peter was (...) at (...), proved to his h^d, and ^ (...)

the (...) with (...), speaking like the Dragon, Rev. 13. and (...) Bish^
p^ceeding from him, (...) needs (...) such, jure divi^, because his (...) is
from the (...).

POSITION 2. They are Di^cesan Bishop^ by divi^ right.
1 BEcause they know (...) hold that a Di^san Bishop is one over many (...);
(...) they (...) it written that the holy Ghost set many Bishops, and Elders
ov^ (...) flock and Church: at (...) one Church, Act 12. 47. and 15. 2^. and
therein may Eld^s, Acts 15. 6. 2^, 23. at (...) one Church, Ephesians 1. 1. R^v. 2.
5. but many Elders, Act^ 20. 17. or (...) verse 28. At Philippi many Bishops,
yet but on^ Church, Phil. 1. 1. and Saint (...) when he had planted Churches,
appointed T^ to ordain Eld^, Bishops in every City, more than one, Tit. 1. 5.
^. as the Apostle himself did in every Church Elders, Acts 14. 23. who kept
one way and co^rse al^ke, in all and ev^ry Church, 1 Cor. 4. 17. and 7. 17. Now
so many in one Church could not be Di^san Bishops.

2. Because neither Christ nor his Apostles, ever ordained any ordinary
Ecclesia^ function, to be ever continued in any Church, which he that was
appointed thereunto, could not in his own person perform without substitut^;
But a Discos^ Bishop takes more upon him, then he can by himself discharge,
but must have his substitutes by reason of the largeness of his ju^isdiction,
over hundred^ of congregations.

3. Bec^e (...) Postscripts to Saint Paul's Epistles, the one to Timoth^, and
the other to Titus, are the words of men, ^humane testimo^ies, (and false too,
as is proved fully by the learned) and therefore cannot confirm a Dis^ Bishop
to b^of divine authority, and of divine right.

4. Because they ^nne upon mere suppositions, taking for granted what yet they
have not proved, nor can prove to uphold their Di^ dignity: such be these.

1. That Timothy and Ti^ were not E^angelists, substituted only for a time at
Ephesus, and in Creet (to do what the Apostle would have done, had he been
there) contrary to 2. Tim. 4. 5. in that Epistle, in the Postscript whereof he
is called a Bishop. 2. That these two were Bishops, differing from Elders: when
no where their consecration is mentioned; and were they Bishops Di^san, because
the Postscripts say they were Bishops^ but when so consecrated, or how, there
is no mention; And is it any way likely, that S^ (...) making else where, A^
20. 17. 18. 28. Elders and Bishops all one, yea, and that in his Epistl^ to
Titus, chapter (...). 5. 7. that by the false Postscript naming them Bishops,
we should take the name of Bishops to be of another sor^, (...) Saint Paul
meant, and had made? 3. That Saint Paul (...) to them ^is Epistles, as to
di^san Bishops, and how to behave themselves in their Episcopal authority, as
a p^terne in them to be followed of such like succeeding Bishops.

If Paul wrote to Timothy his first Epistle, from whence they fetch all their
authority for ^piscopacy, why is not the Postscript put at the end of this
Epistle, to make him a Bishop, while he was at Eph^, but at the end of the
other Epistle, out of which they do make little ^se for this their standing?
If he was then Bishop at Eph^, when the first Epistle was written, then its
clear that Saint Paul wrote not the Epistle to him, as a Bishop, but as his
substitute for the time in his absence, 1. Tim. 3. 14. 15.

To him Saint Paul wrote, as also to Titus, not to make them Bishops, of which
not one word in the Epistles written to them, but what they should do,
according to the present condition of the Churches, and by those rules and
precepts which he wrote, how the Churches of Christ should be ordered for the
time to come, and not by these pre^pts and rules, to erect new Officers in
Christ's Church, which he never ordained, there is not a word in the Epistles to
prove this to be the s^ope.

But they having ^ped this di^san, dignity, and presumptuously practicing what
they do, they take to themselves, what they ^n find in the Epistles to bear
them up, contrary to the intention of the Apostles writing.

4. That the, power of ordination and jurisdiction was then (...) Bishops, and
not in the Elders, when in the Eldership was the power of ordination, and
imposition of hands. 1. Tim. 4. 14. Act. 13. 3. and jurisdiction and rule in
them, to ^t the Elders, they which preached and labored in word and Doctrine,
which fed the (...) these were they t^t ruled, Heb. 13. 7. 1 Th. 5. 12. 1 P^.
5. ^, ^. 1. Tim. 5. 17. you, such rule the Elders had, as Saint Peter warns
them not to lord it over Go^ h^tage, which had been n^dlesse, if the authority
ha^ be^ in the hands of others. 1 Pet. 5. 3. These be their false suppo^tions
and (...) imaginations, on which they ^ave built their rottering dig^es. 5.
Bec^ thi^ setting up of one in dignity over many, is an homane invention long
after the Apostles days, which was devised to prevent Schi^, say they. But
this invention was no^ of the spirit of Genesis First for that in the Apostles
days there were schi^es, 1 Cor 3. 3. and 1^. 1^. and (...), R^. 1^. 17. yet
the holy Ghost did not direct the Apostle, to ordain any di^ Bishop to prevent
Schis^, neither there, where he mentions those schi^es and divi^ as (...), nor
any such rem^y in his Epistles ^to Ti^hy, and T^. 2. Be^se as Doctor Whit^ has
written, the (...) devised has proved worse than the disease: which does never
happen to that remedy, whereof the h^ly Ghos^ is the Author. 3. Because the
holy Spirit which could foresee, what evil would en^r upon this devise, would
not ordain that for a remedy to prevent (...), (...) and diss^, which was
never ^erto found an effectual remedy for it, but (...) her begat pride,
(...), and other evils in the Church even to this day. 4. For that this devise
was from the spirit of Antichrist, Satan taking advantage upon this gro^d, to
raise up (...) all, and so a (...) government, for the reason is alike for
Archbishops over Bishops, Pat^ks ov^r Archbishops, P^ over Patriarks, as
Bishops over (...): except men would va^ly imagine that schis^ would only
arise among Pas^rs, and not among Bishops, Arch. Bishops, (...), and (...) too,
contrary to experience and truth of Histories.
6 (...) in the (...) days all the Church^ in Ci^ the Believers met in one
place, as Par^oners d^ ^ow ^

^ (...), ((...) Cities were (...) then Christians, (...) in (...)) (...)
Bishops in those days (...) (...), (...) (...) if (...) be denied that then
there were no Parish^, (...) must deny di^cesan Bishops, because there is no
Di^cesse, where there be no Parishes.

7. Because all the (...) beyond the (...) no such Bishops; and shall we think
that (...) (...) all such famous Churches, in so foul an error, as to cast
(...)? we have no sound (...) so to (...). 8. ^ his (...); (...) (...) (...)
(...) Church (...).
For Christ's primitive Church in all the first hundred of (...), and after

Such (...) are cast out of the Church in (...), not only as (...), but (...).

Here in England in every (...), at s^verall tim^s there have been a vacancy
of Bis^, and that so^ for 2. years, some for 3. (...), some (...) 10. (...)
some for (...). years, as (...) by some observed, and (...) down throughout
all the (...) in (...).

Lastly, what good do they, which may not be done without them, as it was wh^
they were not, and where in ^her pl^ces they be not^ There is theref^re (...)
need of them.

To conclude, all that which has been said in the former position against a
Bishops superiority over^ (...), in their own congregations, ^re against
(...): whose (...) we^ see to be divine, by the so many good (...) made against
it, and therefore be they not to^ blame, who are so much offended with th^r so
overtopping (...), and goodne^? It were ^ch to (...), that all could see it,

POSITION 3. They are (...) called Lord (...).
1. BEcause (...) (...) Christ, said to his Disciples, (...) know that the
Princes of the Gentiles (...), (...) ^ship, but it shall (...) be so, with you

2. (...) (...) (from whom they say they can fetch their greatness) forbids
them to be Lords over Gon^ h^ritage, 1. Pet. 5, 3.

3. Because St. John the Apot wrote to L^dly (...), (who loved to have the
pre-eminence in receiving, forbidding and casting men out of the Church) that
he would (when he came) remember his deeds done, and his pr^ing against the
(...), and others with malicious words, 3. John 9. 10. for those that love the
prehemine^ cannot but ^tter their malice against them, that find fault with
their proud deeds and words.

5. (...) in the con^cration of Bishops, there is not one word of liberty this

Bishop, which he promises to do, by the grace of God, by the help of God, God
being his helper, which they very faithfully perform in being civi^
Magistrates, and sittin^ in the seat of ju^ice to hear temporal canses; ^

4. ^ Divines, witnessed by Chri^, the great Bish^p of o^ souls, who spent hi^

be^ of G^ for (...) and desires the L^ord to endue the Bishop with his ^oly
spirit, that he may preach the word, and bids him take the holy spir^t, and to

6. Because Father Lati^er said, the very Dive^l himself, (...) God setup the
(...) ^ching pr^lacie; and if they preach not ^aith Thomas Bec^, its an evid^t
tok^ that Chri^ sent them not, but Antichrist and the D^ll

7. Because the very Council of Trent, set this down for (...) truth, that the
preaching of G^ds word was the Sess. 24.
principal part of a Bishops Office adding many words, to show the necessity
of their preaching. And therefore the positio^ is as true, as lead is steel:
That Bishops (...) not preach but seldom or ^ever, as it pleases them.

POSITION 6. They are Priests and may so be rightly called. Though they be
Bishops, yet they forget not their Priesthood, but will be called Priests.
1. B Because the Scriptures of the N^ Testament have given them their names,
befitting their Office: which men may not vary from to miscall them by another
name, not befitting their function: we may not presume to spe^ke otherwise of
G^ds Minist^rs than he has taught us to call them; except we think we can
better know how to impose names on them, than he himself, we may not in such
cases presume above that which is written, 1 C^r. 4. 6.

2. B^ause when Christ ascended up into Heaven, and gave gifts for the
Ministry, Ephesians. 4. 11. the Apostl^ mentions what he g^ve, but among these
neither a Pri^sthood nor Priest, he n^meth Apostles, Pr^phets, Evangelists,
Pa^ours Tea^hers, and elsewhere Bishops, Phil. 1. 1. T^. 1^7. Ti^. (...). 1. 2.
and Elders. 1. Tim. 5. 17. but no where put he the name of Priest upon any of
them.

3. Because ^he name Priest often mentioned in S^ripture cannot in any
acc^ption of the name, be rightly applied to any one in (...) minister^all
function under the Gospel. for the name Pr^sts are one of these sorts.

Either Patriar^hal, as was (...) before the Law, Ge^. 14.

Or A^ical under the Law, which God appointed by the ^and of Moses, Exodus 28. 1.

Or Diab^licall, as were the Priests of Ba^l, and of, Jupit^r, 2 K, 11. 18.
^cts 14. 13.

Or huatheni^ like, as the Pr^ of (...), 1 King. 11. 15.

Or the Evangelicall and spiritual Pri^st, which is but one, Jesus Christ
after the order of (...); such a Priest none may presume to be, without
hellish presumption and high arrogance.

Or the Christian Priest, in which sense every Christian man and woman is a
Pri^ unto God, R^v. 1. 6.

4. Because the title of Priest was a name of divine O^fice from Godunder the
Law, but under the Gospel, it is a lying title without the office. For there
is now no Priests O^fice: for a Priests Office is to off^r sacrifice, a bloody
sacrifice, but now uuder the Gospel after Christ, no such sacrifice to be
offered: And we all do acknowledge and have taught hitherto.

5. Because now it is the P^pish name of the Romish Mass Priests, pu^ upon
them by the Babylo^ish Seat of Rome, that great (...), the Mother of Harlots,
and abominations of the Earth, R^v, 17. 1. 5. out of which we are commanded to
come forth, R^v. 18. 4. both from their idolatrous words, and idolatrous
works.

6. Because its much dishonor to Gods holy spirit in his holy Apostles, to
leave the names set down in holy writ, and to take up a name from the ^re of
R^, and put it upon the Ministers of the Lord I^us.

Lastly, because we all prof^sse to have re^ounced her, and therefore it is a
derogation to our Church, a Church of Christ, to retain a name of her
idolatry, as if still we ^ither were her slaves, or had a mind to become so.
For now of late the name Priest is so extolled, as the Elders, of Ephesus, Act.
20. 17. mus^in in the pulpit be again and again called Priests, as if the
name of El^ers, Presbyt^rs given by the holy Ghost, and they made Overfe^rs of
the flock, were too base, except it should be turned into the name of Romish
Priest^, for other Priests by office there are now none. Thus with impudent
boldness is the holy Gh^st controlled, and m^de to speak aft^r the R^ish
fashion, to bring us back to that Wh^re again.

POSITION 7. They stand for, and d^e mai^taine all Cerem^nies upon very good
grounds.
1. B Ecause they cannot be known whence they be, without these R^mish
trincket^, for without their Lordly (...), and these their Ceremoni^s the
Mother Roar would soon be ^orgotten.

2. Because they were first brought in by that blou die Monk (...), the
Arch-Bish^p o^ Canterbury who dyed them in the (...) of the Monks of Bang^r;
which red Scarlet colo^ they have kept eversince; ^or many Ministers have been^
cruelly dealt with in witnessing against th^se, suspended, excommunicated,
deprived, ^d imprisoned. And therefore Ceremonies laid in this scarle^ dye in
g^ine, a color very costly, (...) no marvel, that they are held at so high a
price by them, and not valued at ^o low a rate, as they be by others.

3. Because they say no Ceremonies, no Bishops, therefore ^ust c^use they have
to stand for them, to keep their standing, and Ceremonious observances, though
with much off^nce, of which they take no care: for they find it writt^n, W^
bat^ the by wh^ offenses (...); Mat. 18. 7.

4. Because there was a time in the Apostles (...) when there was Bishops,
El^rs, and yet no such Popish ceremonies, nor pope-like Bishops.

5. Because ^ue religion and (...) pure worship and service can stand well
without them, as in other ^formed Chu^ches.

6. Because go^y Bishop Ho^per withstood them for a time, and desired to be
discharged of his Bishopric rather than to use them, wherein he was opposed
by Ar^. Bishop Cra^er, and Bis^p Ridl^y, (but when they were out of their
Rochets) they did judge^t to be wisdom in him, and simplicity in themselves,
for urging him to the use of them.

7. Because they have been nothing else but snares, and traps unto many Godly
Min^sters, laborious men in the Lords Vin^rd, scourges in their sides, and
thorns in their eyes, and heavy burth^s to them, for they find it written,
that the Scribes, and Pharisees did bind burdens gr^v to be borne upon the
Pe^le, and laid them on men's shoulders. Mat. 23. 4.

8. Because if they hold them as necessary in themselves, they have no
authority from GOD to impose them so upon men's consciences, and it is against
their faithful promise made at their cons^cration, which was to maintain (as
required of necessity to salvation) nothing but that which may be concluded,
and proved out of Scrip^ue.

If they hold them in themselves as things indifferent, y^ in the practice and
imposing of them, they answer not to the rules prescribed for the use and
practice of indifferent things.

For indifferent things must be,

1. Not only lawful, but ^ expedient, convenient, and profitable; 1 Cor. 6,
12. 3 making for peace; Romans 14. 19. 4 for Charity, Romans 14, 15. 5 done to the
ed^ying of one another, R^. 14. 19. 1 Cor. 10. 23. Which is, that we may more
and more grow up, in CHRIST, and be o^r in our faith, and become better. (...)
Done (...), and in order, 1 Cor. 14 This rule they one y make use of, when all
the rest are of like authority, divi^, and Apo^ol call, and delivered by the
same Apostle, which they take no notice of, not careing to sinn^ against their
brethren and against Christ. 1 Cor. 8. 12.
40. That is, as it becomes the House of GOD. Dec^tly, that is, agr^ble to
the pure worship of GOD, without vanity, sup^stition, and Spiritual filthiness.
In Order, that is, without confusion, in a settled course, fit for a holy
As^mbly. (7) Done to the glory of GOD, Cor. 10. 31. tending to set forth the
LORD, eith^r in his titles, attributes, word, worship, and works; by all
which, God is known praised, and obtains glory. (8) That the use be without
offense, whereby a Brother may stumble, or be offended, or made weak, Romans 14,
^1. by being made to do those things with a doubting, and so with a wounded
conscience, and thus he sins, Romans 14. 23. and is made to perish. 1 Cor.
811. For they find it written, what is that to us, see th^n to that. Mat. 27,
(...).

9. Because our Savior CHRIST stood not upon idle Ceremonies, nor imposed any
upon his Disciples, but rebuked the Scribes and Pharisees, as Hypocrites, for
their strict observation of such things as they had devised and taken upon them
to observe. Mar. 7, 2, 9. So it is Pharis^icall to devise and undertake to
observe of themselves what. GOD never commanded.

10. Because Saint Paul would abstain from the use of indifferent things all
his days, lest he make his Brother to offend, 1 Cor. 8. 13.

Lastly, because Saint Paul tell^th them, that by using things indifferent we
are not the better, and by not using them are we the worse, 1 Cor. 8, 8. but
they by making others to use them, (who are not perswad^d of the Lawful use
thereof) they sin against their Brethren, and so against Christ. 1 Cor. 8. 12.

By all those (...) they not very good cause to maintain, to defend, and urge,
with great violence the use of these so pious and needful Ceremonies, so much
tending to peace, edification, and GODS glory? He must be very blind that
cannot see what truth, charity, edifying, conveniencie, profit, and glory,
comes to GOD, where these Ceremonies be urged.

POSITION. 8. They judge it necessary that whatsoever is amiss in the Church,
should be caref^ly and speedily reformed, and this is evident to all.
1. BEcause they refuse to hear and receive any complaints against their
Courts, and devile which way to vex those that clearly inform against their
unlawful proc^dings, and illegal courses.

2. Because they stop the way and passages of all reformation, by withholding
the means which should do it; by making the supreamest in authority believe,
that there needs no reformation toward the better part, except it be by
innovations, to draw back to the Mother Church of R^me: By reproaching such
with hateful names, who labor for a reformation of abuses.

3. Because they or their Chaplains do with all strength, by their best
learning, either ^cuse, or defend every thing, which is justly found in faul^
within their government, in their manner of governing, in their Ministry, in
their Ceremonies, and (...) service, or what else so ever needs any
reformation.

And why they set themselves to be (...) ready (...), is, for these ^roved
reasons.
1. BEcause they hold it policy to ^mend nothing least they should grant
something to be (...) and so (...) such as have a long (...) desir^d, and
endeavored, by word, by writing, and by (...) much, to bring them to it, and
would heartily praise G^D to s^e all things in better order, for the good of
GODS Church, and the praise of his Name, and peace of his People.

2. Because they know the Northern wind has blown that way, suddenly arising
as a storm, whilst they set sail toward the South-East in a calm weather,
fearing no such tempest.

3 Because they read that albeit Christ found fault with the corruptions, and
superstitions in the Jewish Church, yet the corrupted high Priests, Chief
Priests, learned Doctors, Hypocritical Scribes, and Pharisees, would run their
own way, and amend nothing; but plotted his death, as the Evangelists show.
And therefore why should these out Reverend Fathers amend any corruptions at
the motions of Christ's Servants.

4. Because the unholy Pope, and his heathen-like Prelates at Rome, did never
hold it fit to make any alteration in their (...), further then they were
enforced, and when they seemed to go^e about it, they like cunning craftsman in
their Trade, did it with such caveats, and cautions, (witness their Trent
council) as all that which they did, was as good, or little better then nothing.

5. Because (it may be) they hold that an Ecclesiastical State cannot decline
nor be corrupted by the evils of times, for that they read how our Savior
Christ had somewhat against the Bishops in the (...) Chure^s, against the (...)
Bishop, for loss of his first Lov^e, against the Bishop of (...), for
suffering the Doctrine of (...), against the Bishop of Thyatira, for permitting
wicked I^sabel, a false Prophetess her fornication, and Idolatry, against the
Bishop of Sardi^, for resting more upon a name or fame; then upon the truth of
Religion, and the power thereof, against the Laodicean Bishop (that had such a
high co^it of hims^e, as might make him matchable with the most of our Reverend
Prelates, even the highest in the instep) for his loathsome lukewarmenesse.

Lastly, they are very indifferent which Religion tak^ place, when there
Protestancy or (...), so they may enjoy their Lordly dignities, and dash out
the brains of Calvi^, and that G^vian Doctrine, that Presbyterian Raskal, as
our highest Reverend Father, in his wisdomc and railing zeal called him.

POSITION 9. They may very well rule by their sole power alone.
1. BEcause they find it written, that two is better than one, the one to lift
up the other, if one happen to fall: but woe to him that is alone. Eccl. 4. 9.
10.

2. Because they forget not how King David in bringing up the Arc would have
all the chosen men of Israel with him, 1 Samuel 6. 2. 1 Chro. 15. 3. and how King
Hezekiah would for keeping the passover consult with his Princes; and the
congregation in Jerusalem, 2. Chro. 30. 2.

3. Because our Savior said, tell the Church, Mat. 18. 17. which Church
consists of more then one, at the least of two or three, vers^ 20.

4. Because we read that at the ordination, not any one of the Apostles would
ordain Deac^s alone, but, said jointly, whom we may appoint over this
buisinesse Acts 6. 3. Nor did the Ap^stle Saint Paul ordain Elders, but with
(...), for its said they ordained Elders, Acts 14. 23. And the imposition of
hands was by the (...), 1 Timothy 4. 14.

2. In the act of excommunication, casting out, and receiving in, Sa^ Paul
would do neither of himself, but, with others gathered together, 1 Cor. 5. 4.
2. Cor. 2, 6 8. 10.

3. In making decrees and Canons for the Church, the Apostles would not do it
alone, but with the Elders also Acts 15. 22. 23.

5. Because its without all example in tempora^l government, in the handling of
temporal matters, which are not of so high a nature, as spiritual, as every
one does willingly acknowledge: for Kings have their Counsels: and we shall
find, that no temporal court is there in this Kingdom of the higher sort,
where the authority does re^in one only person; but the principal person has
either Colleagues or Allessours.

The Chancelour of England has an Assistans. of. twelve Masters of the
Ghancery The Master of the Wards has a Council of the Court. The Kings ^nch,
Common Pleas, and the Exchequer are benches of a certain number of Judges. So
has the Chancel^ of Duchy a Council of Court. The Exchequer Chamber has the
Lord Treasurer with him, and with him joined the Chancelour, and Bar^ns. The
Star Chamber is an Ass^blie of the Kings privy Council aspersed with with the
Lords Spiri^uall, and Temporal. The Lord Pr^sidents in the Marches of Wales,
and in the North have their Counsels.

Now if no one be fit to be alone in Civil Courts (^xcept Bishops, be neither
faulty, nor subject to be faulty) the Bishops are not to be alone in their
jurisdiction, and Ecclesiastical Courts.

POSITION. 10. Their high authority so lawful, they all obtain by very
lawful means.
1. BEcause they preach to please, for they find it written, If I please men I
should not be the servant of Christ, Gal. 1. 10.

2. Because they follow the time, as the readiest way to preferment, observing
what is acceptable to great ones, and avoiding what may offend them, because
they find it written of some chief Rulers in the I^ish Church (who knew and
believed more then they would manifest) that they loved the praise of men, more
then the praise of God, John 12. 42.

3. Because when some have not been able otherwise to prevail, they have
offered moneys; because they find it written, that Offers have been made by
one, a Devil, to Jesus Christ, All this will I give thee, Mat. 4. 9. and by
another, a servant of the Devil, Simon Magus, offering to the Apostles money
to have the gift of the holy Ghost, Act. 8 18, 19.

4. Because they greatly extol the dignity of Lord Bishops, by writing for it,
by preaching alowd for it in high places; and cannot or will not otherwise
believe, but that they be such (...) Lords jur^ divine; for they find it
written, how can (...) believe which receive honor one from another, and seek
not the honor which comes from God alone? John 5. 44.

Now all these so lawful means, they use, because they would be known to
come with no greedy desire to such honor. And therefore before their
consecration, they hypocritically refuse it three times; because they have
either read, or heard of, as it has bintold them, that really, and in earnest,
some ancient Bishops have had Bi^p-ricks forced upon them against their wills,
as had Saint Augusti^, Ambrose, Athanasius, Gregory (...) Father and many more;
some utterly have refused, and by no perswa^ons would take diverse great and
wealthy Bishop-ricks, as, on^ Ephraim Syrus, Ny^, and Saint Bernard, who did
refuse the Bishopric of (...) and Mill^, as also did Adrian the Archbishop of
Canterbury, with others more; but more fools they, for their (...) shame none
now, or very few, to seek (...) after Bishop-ricks, and to use such blessed
means as are before mentioned, to obtain them. For they find it written, that
in the last days men shall be lovers of their (...) s^lves, (...), and so
forth, 2 Timothy 3. 1. 2.

POSITION 11. They may not forsake their so warra^table Lordly Prelaticall
standing.
1. BEcause they read the complaint, they ceased ^ot from their (...) doings,
nor from their stubborn way, (...). (...). (...).

2. Because Christ has said, (...) plant which my heavenly Father has not
planted, shall be (...) up, M^. 15. 13.

3. Because they know the love to be great, both of wealth, honor, and
ple^sure, and they read that Chri^ Discipl^ ^sooke all to follow him, Mat 19
27. And (...) voluntarily left his honor, and the pleasures of sin, (...)
the reproach of Christ with the people of God, Heb. 11. 25. 26.

4. Because they find it written, thou (...) not the things which be of God,
but these things which be of men, Mat 16. 23.

5. Because they are taught a good lesson by Saint (...) saying love not the
World, nor the things that are in the World, (that is, the lust of the eyes,
the lust of the eyes and the pride of life) if any man love the world, the love
of God the Father is not in him, 1 John 2 15.

6. Because they (...), or may read, of very many Bishops, in former times, who
voluntarily renounced See Tim and Tit. (...).
their places, not only Bishops in other Countries, but ours here in our own
Nation; as of four Archbishops of Canterbury. four of York, two of London,
two of Lincoln, two of Coventry and Litchfield, two of Worcoster, three of
Rochester, and others to the number of 37. or 38. Bishops, Putta a Bishop of
Rochester left his place and turned a Schole. Master. all his daves. Father
Latimer gave over his Bishopric of Worcester', and blessed God that gave him
that grace to resign it, and to make himself a quondam Bishop.

But when our Reverend Lordly Fathers think on these, they oppose Lordly
(...), a better example for them to follow, for he (as they do) loved to have
the pre-eminence, 3 John 9. and they look upon hundreds of others, more
worthy imitation, wiser men, who learned the words of our Savior Christ
without book, The Children of this world are wiser in their generation, then
the Children of the light, Luke 16. 8.

7. Because they know that this Lordlynesse, and their secular employments,
hinder greatly the spiritual function, and almost quite takes them off from
it, as the Kings of Denmark and Sweden found to be true, and as we find it,
if we will judge aright, and as the now most reverend Archbishop of
Canterbury, acknowledges in his dedicatory Epistle before his late published
book, that by such occasions he was made too much a stranger to his Books.

8. Because they know, what great good they may do to settle peace between his
Majesty and his Subjects, and prevent much evil, which may fall out upon both
Nations; if they would freely and truly confess these three things.

1. That their Lordly standing is not jure divine, but an hum (...) invention,
as has been heretofore acknowledged by Bishops, by holy Martyrs, learned.
Doctors, in this our Church. 2. That true religion, with the saving knowledge
of Christ, might be more propagated, Gods holy worship more purely preserved
without them, then with them, as the Church of Scotland has found true by
experience, and does testify as much. 3. That the Civil estate, may be most
peaceably governed, and Monarchical government made to slourish in piety, and
plenty without their great Lordships; If the Cathedral great revenues might be
employed to the training up of young Divines, and thence Pastors chosen when
places are void in Parishes; If Bishops. Palaces might be for Schools of
Learning, and the Temporalities, bestowed to the maintenance thereof, and other
pious uses, as by the wisdom of the state in Parliament should be thought
most fit, among other godly acts, to help to enlarge the maintenance of many
poor Ministers, who have livings of very small value, of only ten pound or
twelve pound per annum, and some no more numeratis (...), out of which they pay
Tenths and Subsidies; yea and some where, at a new Bishops entrance they pay
him a benevolence, the tenth of their poor maintenance, which their gracious
good Lordships will not remit one penny off.
POSITION 12. No Bishops, no King; this is undeniable.
FOR they support the Throne of Kings; this is an undoubted truth: the reasons
are very manifest.

1. Because its (...) in Revel. 17. 12. that the ten horns are ten Kings,
which receive power as Kings at (...) with the Beast.

2. Because they reign as Kings, without the King; for.

1. They keep their Courts, and Visitations without special patent under the
broad Seal. 2. They print Articles upon their own authority, and minister
oaths upon them. 3. They send out processes in their own name, and many other
things they do, contrary to the Statutes of the (...), as has by some learned
in the Law been fully proved; by which they do rule over his Majesty's good
Subjects contrary to his Crown and Dignity.
3. Because Kings may very well and safely reign without them; for

1. The Roman Emperors did reign, a long time before there were any Lord
Bishops. 2. King (...) here the first Christian King reigned without them, and
it was he that made some Bishops, some Archbishops, and not they him a King.
3. (...), and others States in reformed Churches do subsist without them, and
cannot Kings be Kings without such Lord -- like Bishops? they may if they have
but eyes to see it. 4. As spiritual Lords, they have nothing to do in Civil
causes, and as they be Barons by their ^lities, they be made so great (...), to
live in super fluitie; and why should they supply the place of Temporal Lords?
Is it not to the temporal Lords very disgraceful? yea is it not very ominous
to a Kingdom? And this (...), because against the holy order of Pastors, and
against Christ's own words ( it shall not be (...) with you) they are lifted
up to be 'Princes; busying themselves as busybodies in great affairs, which
concerns them not, becoming ill Counselors where they be, to the detriment
of both Church and State; for they are left of God to themselves, because they
leave their sacred calling, as if it were too base for their high minds, and
deep reaches in State businesses.
4. Because Christian the third King of Denmark, our Kings great Grandfather
by the Mother side, rooted out all the Bishops of his Kingdom in one day: as
annoyance to the State, and have been kept out now hitherto fully an hundred
years; So as here, is a King, and no Bishop, and in Sweden, as I take it, no
Lord Bishops, and yet there is (...) authority.

5. Because our King, as King, has no dependency of Bishops, but is over them,
and they his Subjects, they depend upon him, and if they usurp not their
power, they have their Episcopal authority and jurisdiction from him, at whose
pleasure they fall, if his Majesty please to (...) their authority, and to cast
them out.

POSITION 13. They stand wholly, for a learned, grave, paineful and godly
ministry.
First, For a Learned Ministry.
For they have greatly pestered the Church.

I. In making many bare reading Ministers, to be Curates, and too many to be
in the room of Pastors, for they know well, that a Pastor must be apt to
teach, 1 Timothy 3. 2. as they say in his ordination, and do give him authority
to teach; they hear out of Gods word, that they are blind and dumb dogs, Esaias
5. 6.

II. In tollerating them to be so continually, for they know where these be,
the people are as Sheep without a Shepherd, Mat. 9. neither be they ignorant
of that which Solomon says, where there is no vision there the people perish,
Pro. 29. 18. nor of Christ's speech, if the blind lead the blind, both fall into
the ditch, Mat. 15. 14. in no reformed Church in Christendom are such, but
here, and in the Antichristian (...) of Satan.

3. In not consulting about means, and using the same to remove this so great
a plague to the people, and to prevent it for the time to come.

4. In never rebuking their slothfolnesse, no not in the younger men, nor
stirring them up to get knowledge, for to instruct the people,

5. In putting down such divine exercises, as have been used heretofore, when
Ministers met and handled (...), and the same piece of Scripture, the youngest
beginning, and so successively to the Eldest; some grave Ministers being chosen
as chief for the time; all this done publicly, and then in private, if any
thing were needful to be advised upon, or any mistake, to deliver their
judgments upon it, and so appoint another day for the like meeting once in a
fourthnight, or once a month; which exercise did much good to many, and
continued in some market Towns heretofore very many years.

6. In comforting these blind Guides, by preferring prayer before preaching and
common service to be such, as people should rest therewith satisfied,
especially if they have their quarterly Sermons.

2. For a Grave Ministry.
Because they admit many too young men into the Ministry, if of any degree in
Schools, if they can answer some few questions in Latin, and can speak upon
some text, it may be an hour before them, having penned it after their best
hability, though they bevery ignorant in the Scriptures, and little acquainted
with the study of Divinity; for in admitting of these they know what Saint
Paul's Canon is, he must not be a Novice, least he be puffed up in pride, and
so fall into the condemnation of the Devil, 1 Timothy 3. 6. and they also know
that youth is subject to be despised, 1 Timothy 4. 12. that many of these are
vain (...), getting in to be some idle Curats, and giving themselves to
liberty, till they enter into the bond of marriage, and the next bond following
(...) which (...), and (...) then of children, a great disgrace to the
Ministry.

3. (...).
For that they are content that many teach negligently, but now and then, (...)
not once a year, some once a year, some quarterly; some monthly, and some
once in a fortnight, because they read that amongst the (...), in the (...)
Sabbath day was preaching, (...). (...) was Christ's custom to preach every
Sabbath, Luke 4. 16, and the Apostles in the Jewish (...); ancient Fathers used
(...) to do every Sabbath. Christ (...), (...). ^. (...) yet (...) this (...)
them not, because they find it written, (...) are destroyed for want of
knowledge; because (...), I will also reject thee, that thou shall (...), (...)
forget thy (...) 4. 6.

2. They themselves (the most of them) are evil examples, for they lay aside
preaching for the most part, as if it were either no part, or the least part of
their duty.

3. Though in (...) Ministers they charge upon them this duty, and have made a
(...) for a licensed Preacher to preach every Lords day; yet is there no
inquiry after Ministers negligence herein, no calling them to their Courts, no
(...), no suspension, (...) any other censure upon them (...) the same. Because
they read that (...) did not neglect to (...) (...) to stir up the gift in him,
and to study hard and to preach diligently; 1 (...) 4. 13. 16. 2 Timothy 4. 1. 2.
and the same (...) (...) the Elders of (...) to look to their flock, over
which the holy Ghost had made them Over^, Act (...) willed the (...) to charge
(...) to take (...) the Ministry which he had received of the Lord, to fulfill
it. Col. 4. 14.

4. But unto (...) Ministers, they have a special eye, especially if they find
the least (...) in conformity, or not wholly conforming (...) their (...)
innovations: though in (...) they preach nothing, (...) may any way (...) the
peace of the Church, either for (...) or discipline, but rebuke the (...) of
the times, condemned by Gods Law, and the (...) of the Land, and the very
Canons of (...).

For 1. They find it written, (...), and (...), and (...) the (...) (...) (...)
the Prophet, because he rebuked their flattering of the King, and the rest of
his companions, telling the King the truth, as the King found it, (...) King
(...). 2. They also find it written, how the high Priest of ^. 3. They are not
ignorant of the troubles of the faithful Prophet (...), how the wicked (...)
his (...). 26. 11. he was informed against to the (...) Priest, and was called
by a false (...) a mad man. (...). 29. 26. whereupon he was (...), imprisoned,
and (...) in the Stocks, and all was, because he preached against wicked
Priests, wicked false Prophets, the wicked high Priest, and against the
superstition, and (...) of the times, for which great wrath came upon them, the
sword, (...), and captivity.
^.

^ (...) to (...) to (...) them, in their (...), be^ (...) and (...) did so
with (...), (...).

Thus we see, how they encourage diligent Ministers, and what (...) they be to
the idle Ministers; Non-residents, and (...), being all faithful men to them,
but not of God, to their (...).

4. (...).
^.

1. (...).

^ life, and such we have frequenting Tavernes, (...) Alehouses, drinking till
some be drunk, falling to (...), and sometimes to fighting; for they know its
written, that a Minister is to be (...), (...), of good (...), not given to
(...), (...), (...) striker, 1 ^
(...), (...) 3.

3. Some other of these so conformable, yet of an other temper, they bear with
all being (as one of themselves complain) (...) and ambitious, in heaping
together Benefices and promotions, (...) to discharge their duty, either by
their own persons, or by entertaining or providing able and sufficient (...),
for they find it written, these (...) are (...), never having enough, which
look (...) their (...), and every one of them (...) their (...), Esaias 56. 11.
And they find it complained of by Saint Paul, that all seek their own, and
not the things that are Jesus. Christ, Phil 2. 20. and the same Apostle tells
them, that they should not be (...), (...), but as men of God to (...) these
things, 1. Tim. 6. 12. Tit 1. 7.

Yet these three sorts of godly Ministers (and that in great number) are
nourished up in the bosom of our Church almost, if not altogether without
control.

For they know all these three forts to be for their Lordships, their standing
is secured by being over blind, profane, worldly and (...) affected Ministers.
These they trouble not, for they read that the zeal of the Bishop of Ephesus
would not permit him to suffer those that were evil, Rev. 2. 1. These keep
people in ignorance a grounded stadle for superstition, will worship, (...) if
you will, and whatoever devised forms and gestures, their Lordships please to
put upon them, yea the silly people devoutly make them acts of religion, which
(...) their good Lordships; for they know that these miserable sort of people
do worship as did the (...), they know not what, John 4. 22. and that they may
ride upon them, as Balaam upon his Ass.

POSITION 14. They hate to (...) the King.
1. BEcause when they (...) as they ever (...) in (...) they (...) before the
King, but not to the King, but ever for the King. B. M.


2. Because they study the (as one of (...)) (...) what may (...) please, they
(...) their (...), (...) the (...) Prophet (...) with his (...) in his (...) to
his (...) 1. King. 22. 11. 12.

3. If any other be admitted to preach before the the King.

1. They either must be (...) as (...) for (...), knowing (...) High way (...)
and (...) how to (...) before King? for they have (...) their (...) by (...),
and can say it perfectly without book, and without the (...) of God, (...),
(...) for each things, (...), (...) 30. 10. 2. (...) they be such of whom there
is (...) then these men's (...) and (...) most be (...), or a premonition given
them to be very (...) for offending for they (...) the (...) King (...) advised
(...) to do as the false (...) did, to say, as they said, and to speak good,
(...) (...). (...). (...). 3. Or they be such (for all the forewarning) as will
speak some what (...) as an (...), (which is hardly ever known in (...)) then
(...) the (...) of Bethel will take him to (...), he must be complained of to
the King, be held unsufferable, (...) sent away with an inhibition, for they
find it written in (...) letters, (...) any more in Bethel, for it is the Kings
(...), (...) it is the Kings (...), (...). (...). 4. Because where they find in
(...) any titles of Honor, and praise given to Kings, (...) what they should
be, they apply (...) King believe, that every way he is such a one; Judge you
that hear them preach, or read their printed (...) made before the King, for
they find it written, there is no (...) Ps. 5. 9. (...), they have (...) out of
(...)? Joh. 32. 21. 22. (...) 5. Because they teach the power of Kings to be
(...) for they (...) the Throne is established by (...). 16. (...). (...) And
they may (...) it (...) God did use (...)
4. (...) they (...)

As (...) did David ^ ^ Samuel (...) (...) (...) Esaias 39. ^ 13. ^ ^ 19. ^
(...). 24. 20. The (...) sharply by a (...), (...) for his (...) 1 Chro. ^
(...). 19. ^ K. 3. ^ ^ ^ (...) ^ ^ ^ (...). 7.

^ Therefore can they (...) in the (...) ones, without their (...) find (...),
as a (...). (...). So (...) that is (...) still, Rev. 22. 11. for they are not
full of power, by the (...) of God, to declare unto Jacob his (...), and to
(...) his sins, as (...). did, (...). 3. 8. 11. and as God by Esaias commanded,
Esaias 58. 1.

POSITION 15. They greatly further the peoples knowledge in divine things (...)
their ignorance. (...)
1. BEcause they make such ignorant Ministers and tolerate these sorts before
mentioned, to be their Ministers.

2. Because they, as you have heard, (...) so much godly and painful (...),
whom they often displace, and put wicked ones into their rooms, their now
daily practice.

3. Because (...) are put down by some of them, and wholly throughout (...)
(...), with a thanks be to God that they have (...) within their (...) for they
read how their (...) shut up the Kingdom of God against men, Mat. 23. 13. and
(...) away the key of knowledge. Luke. 11. 50. (...) themselves, but did hinder
others that would have entered.

4. Because they make reading preaching, for they find in the (...) (...), that
when the (...) were read, they had (...) that preached unto (...) Act. 15. 21.
and 13. 15.

5. Because they (at (...) some of them) prefer set payers read, before
preaching, holding prayers to be Gods service, and preaching no part of his
service.

For that they may read, (...) preaching was ever before set (...), which (...)
300 years after (...), (...) (...) spent himself in preaching he sent his
(...) (...), (...). (...) ^ (...), (...), and charged it upon others with great
(...), 1 Timothy 4. (...) Moreover they (...) ( Romans 10. 14.) knowledge and (...).

6. Because they forbid preaching in the afternoon, for they find it written
that (...) Paul preached in the afternoon, Act. 20. 7. (...) the (...) Peter
and (...), who went up to the Temple at the (...), and there preached, Act 3.
1. (...). (...). The (...) Fathers, (...), (...) and others, preached in the
afternoon, and so do the Ministers in all reformed Churches.

7. Because they appoint catechizing in the afternoon, to put down preaching,
and such a (...) as does no good to the (...) and simple; for Ministers are
(...) to ask no other questions then are in the common Catechism; and yet
this kind many Ministers observe (...); and are never questioned for it.

8. They permit not any to leave a reading Minister, nor an idle preaching
Minister, when he (...) pains to preach, to go to (...) an other (...)
Teacher, and (...). The Preacher for his (...) shall (...) without check, but
(...) that goes to hear shall (...), and (...) open (...), and (...) God
(...).

1. Because Sir Henry (...) (...), in a (...), (...) as (...) not (...) it. 2.
^. 3. (...) they know the people of the (...) went to hear Christ. (...). 5.
1. and 21. 38. and also (...), (...) (...), (...) the (...) though (...) (...),

the people to their (...), (...) made (...) to (...) for it, (...) made they

Lastly they hinder this going abroad to (...), for (...) they have (...) how
people (...) (to understand) without a Preacher, Romans 10. 14. and they remember
what the (...) (...), that he could not understand what he (...) a guide, Act.
8. 31.

Who (...) of understanding, (...) cannot (...) hence very (...) care (...)
(...) (...) (...) have of (...) men's souls, because they find it written, that
the mind (...) not good (...). 19. (...).

POSITION 16. They have a special care; that God being a (...), should have a
spiritual (...), and this (...) according to his written word.
1. BEcause they have (...) a (...) of (...) (...) of (...), to worship God by;
for they find (...) ^ (...) so will I (...), (...) not (...) to (...) God; but
whatsoever I (...), (...) 12. 39. 31. 32.

2. Because they are (...), that the (...) people, say their service and
prayers with, (...) after (...), though they understand little or nothing; for
they read, that we must pray with the (...) and (...) 1. Cor. 14. 15. and also

3. 4,

POSITION. 17. They prefer the Churches union, and what God requires to be
done, before their own Lordly dignity, and what they themselves command.
1. BEcause they can be content, that the King and his subjects should be at
ods, even to the shedding of much blood, if God prevent it not, rather then
they will leave their Rochets. For it is written, the Devil is come (...) unto
you, having great wrath, because he (...) but a short time, Rev. 12. 12.

2. Because whosoever (...), that do reprove them, and do discover their
pride, tyranny, and Lording over (...), (...) their corrupting of Gods worship,
their gross (...) of Princes, their opposing the (...) of (...) godliness,
their cunningly suppressing preaching in part, and painful preachers, their

chief Priests beat the Apostles Acts 5. 40. that they (...) and killed such as
were sent unto them, (...). (...). 34. 37. yea also they procured Christ
himself to be (...) to death.

3. They trouble men more for neglect of their Ceremonies, then for not
preaching diligently; more for (...) at the name of Jesus, then for swearing by
the name of (...), the heart of God, and the blood of Christ; more for breach
of an All Saints day, then profaning the Lords day: for that they find it
written, as is before noted in the former position, that the Scribes and
Pharisees stood more for the observation of their own traditions, and what they
(...) of themselves to (...), (...) the holy Commandments of God, like
hypocrites as they were, Mar. 7. (...). 8.

POSITION. 18. They be the greatest Enemies, that the Church of Rome (...)
amongst us.
1. BEcause they hold her to be the Mother Church, for they find her called the
Mother of (...), and abominations of the earth, Rev. 17. 5.

2. Because they hold her a (...) Church of Christ, for they find it written,
that (...) is (...) with the (...) of the Martyrs of Jesus, and that Christ
said, (...) of her (...), (...). 17. 6. and 18. 4.

3. They deny the Pope to be (...); for they find it written, that (...) is

That he is that (...), the King of the (...), Rev. 9. 11. That (...) is the

4. They lead the way (...) (...), for they (...) the name (...) more than

Crucifixes, setting up Candlesticks, and somewhere do burn Candles, enfignes
of (...) (...) the (...) of confes^ (...) (...). For they find it written, They

their ceremonies, superstitious gestures; the name of Priest, (...), (...); ^

5. Because they suffer Priests and (...), not (...) to be, but also to (...)
in the Land, against the Law of God, and the Laws of this Land, they seek
them not out, they call them not before them, they having them in their hands,
use them very kindly, otherwise then they do many of Gods Ministers; for they
find it written, that the high Priests (...) and (...) regarded (...), and
other false Prophets more then (...).

6. Because such as fall away to that (...) Rome, are very gently dealt with,
for (...) of offending them, and as for known Church Papists, they can
friendly entertain them; for they find it written, they strengthen the hands
of evil (...), that none (...) wick^, (...). 22. 14.

7. Because they suffer popish books to pass, and popish (...) to be
preached without control, for they find it written, that Letters have been
sent by false Prophets, (...). 29. 25. and Teachers. 2. (...). 2. 2. and have
been permitted to preach, and prophecy.

8. Because they cannot endure, so much as an Almanac, having in stead of
popish Saints, put into it the They will (...) call them Martyrs; but (...).
(...) may in print call them (...).
^ in the high Commission Court, for they find it written, ^. 9. 27.

9. Because the Papiste dare lodge (...) them, where the Mother Churches, the
Cathedrells be, and never appeate in their Courts; for who ever law a Papist
cyted openly to their Count, and for neglecting, yes refusing to come to the
(...), to (...), made to do (...) or if not (...) be (...), excommunicated,
aggrivated and pursued to an (...)?

10. Because no kingdom or State ((...) Lawee are enacted against them) is so
troubled with Papists, and those seeds-men of Antichrist, Priest and Jesuits,
as ours is, where their good Lordships be.

POSITION 19. They ahborre all show of (...).
BEcause our Church disallowing consubstantiat on, and (...), and acknowledging
the Elements (...) and (...), to be creatutes, yet they call to, as they call
it the (...), not only when the Sacriment is administered, but when the
Elements are not there; which the Papists do not, but condemn it in such as
amongst us do to. Because its written, they have hardened their necks, and des
(...) them their Fathers, Ier. 7. 26. (...) every one after the imagination of
his own heart, Ier. 16. 12.

POSITION. 20. They may very lawfully minister the (...) ex officio, to any
whom they dare call before them.
THis course they take, its well known, putting men to their oaths, making
them to swear to make true answer to them of all that which shall be demanded
of them, for,

1. They know its practiced of the horrible holy Fathers, of that blondie
Spanish inquisition, hated of God, and all good men.

2. They know it to be against the Law of Nature, registered in the civil Law,
for one to swear to become thereby an accuser of himselse; for Nemo tenetur
prodere seipsum.

3. Its a wicked putting of men needlessly, and illegally into a great danger of
the fearful sin of perjury; if any for fear of man should forswear
themselves (as a Peter may sometimes do,) and therefore much more others, may
so through fear miscarry: In a necessary and legal way to minister an oath,
if men damnably forswear themselves, the Imposers of such an oath are
guiltless, but not so in this case.

4. Because they find it written, to be contrary to Abraham dealing with his
servant, when he entreated him to take an oath, before the servant swear,
Abraham told him what he should swear, and the servant made objections for
himself, to prevent the danger of taking his oath in vain.

5. Because they are not ignorant of this, that this course is directly against
Gods will and word, who no where allows this in an ordinary way, to evict
any, but by a certain number of faithful witnesses, and accusers, Numb. 35. 30
thus in the time of the Law, and this was established in the time of the
Gospel, Mat. 18 16. 2. Cor. 13. 1. especially Deuteronomy. 19. 15 and 17. 6:
concerning an Elder, 1 Timothy 5. 19.

6. They read of the equity of the Romans, how Felix Heb. 10. 28.
would stay for the Accusers, Acts 23. 35. of Saint Paul, who heard them, and
gave him leave to speak for himself. The like did Festus, Acts 25. 5. who
said, it was the manner of the Romans so to do, verse 16. and King Agrippa
approved thereof, Acts 26. 1. none of them willing to have him put to his oath,
that so advantage might be taken, against him. Trajane the Emperor said, that
without an Accuser, there is no place Plin. (...). 10.
for an accusation, for that is an evil example, and not Epist. 98.
heard of in our age.

7. Because they cannot but know, that thus to deal with men (to put them to
their oath, thereby to evict, and condemn them, when they cannot by witness
prove any thing against them.)

1. That it is a preventing the order of Gods divine providence, whose will is
to have such proceeded against, whose sins he brings forth to the light,
which if he do not, he reserveth such persons to his own, and not to man's
judgment. 2 It is a running before the Laws of men, which allows no judge
to proceed without production of witnesses for an open crime; for hidden crimes
men's Laws take no notice of.
8. Because they well understand, that by thus dealing, their ground must be
their own ill conceit, ill ^on, or some report of ill minded Adversaries, or
some such wicked uncharitableness, no allowable grounds to proceed in a
judicatory way against any, either before God. or just m n.

9. Because they know, that thus proceeding against all justice and equity;
they themselves must first become their Accusers, and then their Judges.

10. Because holy (...), in his burning heat, thirsting after Christ's blood,
(...) Christ to it by a dreadful adjuration, to make him speak somewhat where
he might accuse him, and condemn him, with the consent of the like Enemies of
Christ, as he himself was; and this means he used, because he had no just
witnesses to accuse him, and to condemn him by: an example of an high Priest
worthy praise and their worthy imitation.

11. Because it is not only against Gods will, under the Law, and under the
Gospel, as before its proved, but its also.

Against reason, by the judgment of Ministers in Aphrick, Victor de persocut,
Vandal.
to whom when such an oath was tendered, they answered, (...) irrationalia nos
putetis, ut juremus nescientes quid charta contineat? Think you us
unreasonable beasts to swear we not knowing what the writing may contain?

12. Aganist the due reverence to the divine Majesty, Jer. 4. 2.
in taking an oath, who requiteth when we swear, to swear in truth, in
judgment, in righteousness, which we cannot do, before we know what to
swear unto.

13. Against the civil Law, by which there is no Digest: lib.
proceeding, till some accuser be bound to prosecute the accusation.

14. Against the ancient Canon Law, which says, Decret. page, 2 Cous 23. quast.
4.
peccata quae publicis indiciis discernuntur, punienda non sune.

And here some allege Sixtus 3. in Epist. ad episc. Orientales, who says,
before the Accuser comes and binds himself to prove the Accusations,
Criminationes adversus doctorem uemo recipiat.

15. Against Saint Ambrose who says, a Judge may In Epist. 1 Cor. c1. 5.
not condemn without an Accuser for our Lord, though he knew Iudat for a
Thief, yet he cast him not out, because none accused him.

16. Against the equity and justice of this Land to Statute 15. (...). 8. ca
15 cemmen Law. See (...). touching Bishops effictalls. page 62.

interrogatories, or by any other means then witness, verdict etc. a fellon at
the bar is not forced to any oath, nor proceeded against, though known to be
guilty, but is judged according to allegations, and proof.

17. Against the Liberty of the Subject, to be dealt This master Fuller has
fud manisesled in the defense of (...) Client.
with otherwise then is by Law sufficiently warrantable.

18. Against the safety and peaceable security of any subject, whom they hate,
and date meddle with, at their (...) and pleasure to call them into question,
and by this (...) ex (...), force them to lay themselves open to their malice,
and unjust proceedings;

19. Its not practiced in Reformed Churches, but only under that Roman
Prelate; yet the State of (...), and some other places do not subject
themselves unto it.

20. The Lord Verulam, late Chancelour of England, held the continuance of this
oath, to be contrary to the Laws of this Land, and custom of this Kingdom:

For Prelates are not to put any to their oath, except in matrimonial and
Testamentary causes; So say learned Lawyers.

21. Its thought to have it original from the Statute, Crompton 182 (...): de
^ (...) brev. page 141 (...). page 36. (...). (...). ^.
2. (...). 4. ca 15. procured by the Prelates, against true Gospollers, by them
called Heretics, Lollards, and so was framed against them for defense of
popery, and to overthrow the Gospel.

But here note,

1. It passed without the consent of the Commons who greatly repined against
it. 2. Authority given to press this oath, and for Prelates and Ordinaries to
fine and imprison the K. Subj. was held abloudie Law. 3. Abundance of
Christian blood was shed by the enacting of this cursed Law. 4. Gods judgments
followed hereupon, and were laid to heart by the State. 5. Hereupon the Statute
of imprisoning, and the oath ex officio was made void; And though in K. Phil.
and Mar. (...), a Statute was made according to that of Hen. 4. yet in the 1.
of Eliza: it was repealed.
Obj. In the Star Chamber and Court of Chancery, there is an oath required.

Answer. This is by laying in of a Bill of complaint, in which a legal
accusation is framed against the party; beyond which, the plaintiff cannot
go, nor the defendant shall be urged.

But this oath ex (...), is first given to the party to answer he knows not
to what, then is he examined upon either flying reports, or secret witnesses,
or upon some illimagination against the party, which dealing carries no show
of civil Law, and is flatly repugnant (says the Lord Verulam) to the Common
Law.

Obj. Some allege that by this oath none are tied to answer further then they
are bound by Law.

A. 1. They have no Law to put men to such an oath, no Law of God, no Law of
this Land, and therefore none are tied to take it, nor bound by Law to make any
answer to it at all.

2. In answering, if they plead the benefit of the Law, that they are not bound
to accuse themselves, if the interrogatories and Articles do seem, to touch
the betraying of themselves, then they use captious questions, and do take it
as for granted, that the party is a delinquent, in such Articles as he will
not make answer unto; so though it be said, you shall swear as (...) as the
Law only binds, yet these be but sugered words, to draw men into a snare,
and to make the simple believe that they may take the oath, and the other may
impose it.

Obj. They would feign have warrant from the Scripture, and so to have God to
approve of them, for this purpose, they do allege, Ex. 22. 11. Number. 5. 19.

For the place in Exodus 22. 11. Then shallan oath of the Lord be between them
both, that he has not put his hands unto his Neighbors goods, etc. This
warrants not the wicked administering of the Oath ex Officio.

1. Here is one standing forth and bringing the party before authority; In the
Oath ex officio, no accuser sometimes comes in sight, nor will such a one be
made known. 2. Here the matter is well known, before the party be put to
swear.

In the other, he is enforced to swear, before he know what he is to swear
unto, and if he refuse, he is of their loving kindness and compassion sent
into prison.

3. Here the matter is of common equity, and a (...) civil business,
concerning right between party and party.

There it is about causes Ecclesiastical and criminal matters, and not ever
between party and party in a matter of (...) justice.

4. Here the oath is administered in a case, not otherwise to be tried and
decided, for if it could, say the Hebrew Doctors, the Oath was not to be
administered.

There its administered, whether it can, or cannot be otherwise proved.

5. Here the Judges proceed, in the behalf of the party complaynant, to end
the (...) between them.

In the other, the Judges proceed with relation to themselves, secretly
becoming parties, not to end a (...) between others, but to begin it between
the party and themselves too often.

6. Here the Oath is administered, not ex Officio, upon the Judges pleasure, and
their own authority, but upon the just complaint of another.

In the other ex Officio, is a proceeding upon their own authority, and the
framing of a bill upon their own imagination against the party called before
them, letting the wicked accuser lurk in a corner, or else to be gone, till
they can ripen the (...).

7. Here is an Oath given to make an end of the controversy; to clear the
party, and the (...) to rest satisfied.

In the other the Oath ex Officio, is to begin a controversy, not to clear
the party, but (...) breed him more and greater trouble, for they will not be
satisfied, though they have no just matter against him, but if they let him
depart, its by making him enter into a bond of appearance again, whenever
they (...) call him.

Lastly (...) the Oath is administered only touching the particular cause in
hand. That is administered upon many captious interrogatories, that by all or
some of them, the party may be catched, and brought into danger.


We see from all this, that hence is no (...) for their wickedness, but is
rather against them.

Touching the other Scripture, though in a criminal cause of adultery, Numb.
5. 19. yet it helps them nothing, thus to tyrannize over Ministers and others.

1. It was a Law (all the circumstances and means used) peculiar to the Jews,
because of the man's jealousy against his wife, to satisfy him to prevent
further mischief; but with us no such means is allowed to satisfy the
jealousy of the Husband against his wife. 2. This was to take an Oath against
her self; which our Law allows not. 3. Here the Oath, was not a bare Oath,
but (...) Oath of cursing, to which he was to say Amen, Amen, such a kind of
Oath we use not to (...). 4. Besides the Oath with a curse, other means were
used, by which the truth should be made undoubtedly to appear, as the Text
does show, so as the taking of an Oath in a matter of such (...), served not
the turn, to take away the Husbands jealousy. 5. In this case, the woman
found guilty (...) plagued of God; but if she were (...) she received a
blessing from God, verse 28.
Lastly yet this was not allowed to be done by the Lord, but when there was no
witness against her, or she (...) taken in the fact, verse 13.

These holy (...) are therefore (...), to make God speak for them, who, as I
have proved, is (...) them.

The Conclusion.
IT cannot be sufficiently admired, in these (...) distracted days, that
Bishops the Reverend Fathers in our Church, should be from time to time so
opposed, as they have been. First they have been prayed against. Second
preached against. Thirdly written against. Fourthly witnessed against, by
suffering persecution, suspension, excommunication, deprivation, degradation,
also whipping, pillory, the cropping off of the ears, the flitting of Noses,
fining deeply, and imprisonment unto death. Fifthly, and I hope lastly resisted
with the sword, as if men desired and intended wholly the rooting out of those
so eminent persons, from the Churches of Christ, as if Enemies to peace, to
preaching, to the power of godliness and all goodness, and as if they were lyms
of that Romish Antichrist, Lovers of that (...) of Rome, secret nourishers of
Superstition, Lawles Innovators in matters of religion, Such as makd way for
(...) to the Sea of Rome, the very chief troublers of Church and State,
minding only how to uphold their Hierarchy, and Prelaticall Church, though
with the ruin of the King and his Kingdoms.

But for better discovery of the truth, here is laid before every judicious
Reader, their way and walking, that all may see that will see, and not mistake,
but be enforced to acknowledge them to be such, as they are before the face of
God, and all good men, who can truly judge aright between them, and all those
which so condemn them.

It cannot be denied that they prove themselves to be Bishops, Superiors to
Elders in dignity, from Ti^hy and Titus whom the (...) Postscripts to the
Epistles of Saint Paul make to (...) Bishops; This is their divine ground on
which they build their worthy standing, and well may they. For they follow all
the rules and exhortations given to these two Bishops by Saint Paul very
exactly, and punctually to every thing, being strongly fenced with Saint Paul's
authority in all their doings.

1. They conceive Bishops to be superiors in office, and dignity, to Elders.

For they read that Saint Paul makes Bishops and Elders all one, Tit. 1. 5. 7.
1 Timothy 3. 1. as the fo^mer treatise does declare, and if Elders Pastors and
Ministers be not one and the same, the Apostle has not, in directing (...) and
(...), told what a one a Minister of Christ should be.

2. They claim Jurisdiction over Ministers and others.

For Ti^hy and Titus were extraordinary men, who were substituted for a time,
in Saint Paul's absence, to do 1 Timothy 1. 3. and 3. 14. 15. Tit. 1: 5.
what he was to do, had he been in person there.

But they (...) not, nor (...) any (...) made of any power of jurisdiction
invested in those which the Apostle does call (...): in his describing of a
Bishop, in 1 Timothy 3. 1. and in Tit. 1. 7, 8. 9. no one word is there of
jurisdiction.

3. They challenge ordination to themselves, imposition of hands and making of
Ministers.

For they find it written, that imposition of hands was in the (...), 1 Timothy 4.
14. and that more then one laid on hands, Acts 13. 3. and ordained Ministers,
Laid their hands.
Acts 14. 23. and (...), Acts 6 6. and they also read, that Saint Paul said to
(...), lay hands suddenly They ordained.
on no man; he says not, lay thy hands, as if he alone They laid their hands
on them.
were to do it, but lay hand, to wit, with other on no man; when they would
ordain any, which exposition the words following do confirm, neither b^
partak^rs of other (...) sins, that is, if they would sin in misor (...),
(...) not (...) on such with them, and be guilty of sin with them: So is the
place in Titus of his ordaining Elders to be understood, Tit. 1. 5. for its not
probable, that Saint Paul would give authority to either Timothy or Titus,
which he never (...) to himself alone, but when he ordained Elders, others
therein were with him, Acts 14. 23.

4. These have made many (...).

1. To an other kind of Office, to read service, for they read their Office was
to care for the poor, Act. 6. 2. Very young, and v^o (...):

For they find it written, that the first (...) were honest men, full of the
holy Ghost and wisdom, Acts 6. 3. and that Paul would have them grave (not
light headed lads) holding the Ministry of Faith with a pure conscience, etc.
1 Timothy 3. 8. 9.


5. These have made dumb Ministers, and many other very unfit for the
ministry. For they find it written, that Saint Paul will have his Minister,
Pastor, and Elder to be (...) to teach, holding fast the faithful word, and
to be able by sound Doctrine to exhort and convince (...); as also to be
(...), (...), of good behavior etc. 1 Timothy 3. 1. ^. Tit. 1. 9. Not a Novice,
least being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil,
1 Timothy 3. 6.

6. These do^ not constantly employ themselves, in the preaching of the word,

For they find it written, that Saint Paul would with a vehement exhortation
have Bishop Timothy to preach the word, to (...) in season, and out of season,
etc. 2 Timothy 4. 1. 2. and to (...) to reading, exhortation, and doctrine, and
wholly to give himself (...), 1 Ti^. 4. 13. 15.

7. These, at least not a few of them, have their families not very orderly,
not very religiously demeaning themselves.

For they read, that Saint P^l would have ^ Bishop not given to Wine, (...) his
(...) house, ^ Tim. 3. 3. 4.

8. These (some of them, all know) are covetous, not hospital, nor lovers of
good-men, but bitter against them.

For they find it written by Saint Paul, that his Bishop must be given to
hospitality, not c^s, nor greedy of filthylucre, a Lover of good men, just,
(...), (...), 1 Timothy 3. ^. 3. Tit. ^. 8. and a pattern of good works. Tit. ^.
7.

9. These speak roughly to Elders called before them, and easily receive
accusations and informations against them, and without proof of witnesses will
proceed against them. For they find it written, rebuke not an Elder, but
entreat him, as a Father, and against an Elder receive (...), but before 2. or
3. witnesses, 1 Timothy 4. 1. 9.

10. These be deadly Enemies unto all heretical Spirits.

1. For some of them under pretense writing against Jesuits, do strike
through the sides of the truly zealous defenders of the truth, and the very
truth it self, cunningly upholding popish Tenants. 2. For that in their late
(so called Sacred sy^d) they silently p^c over (...), the S^n heresy, not
touching upon it; but the favorers of this way get up to preferment. 3. For
that (...), that damned and cursed heresy is not laid open, to be certainly
known of all, that it might be discovered, and the Heretics themselves be so
sound out and duly punished. 4. For that the A^s and S^s known, as also
convicted Papists, are never called before them, not proceeded against.
For they find it written, by Saint Paul to Archbishop Titus, that a man that
is an (...), after the first and second (...) to be rejected, Tit. 3. 10.

How really and exactly observant these reverend Fathers be of all S. (...) and
constitutions, may hereby appear to all their Adversaries, who hitherto have
so much and so often, for a long time, complained so bitterly against them, and
their sacred proceedings.

And who sees not, that these reverend (...) LordBishops deserve their honor,
that they walk worthy their places, and are to be maintained for Churches
welfare, and the common wealths happiness, till AntiChrists downfall, and
the utter ruin of Rome, which all Christians have good cause to pray for,
especially if we take into our wise consideration these few things in brief.

1 That all their proceedings are by book, even altogether contrary to that
which is written, as has been declared.

2. That they make Canons such as they please, and without confirmation by act
of Parliament, and yet violently urge them, as Law, upon his Majesty's
Subjects, and do frame Articles out of them by oath to be observed.

3. That whatsoever in the Statute Laws, or in their own Canons they find
useful for themselves, in their way they diligently bend themselves, to have
them carefully observed, but as for all the rest, which perhaps may be such as
tend to true piety, sound doctrine, faithful discharge of good duties to God,
and to man, and for an holy lise and conversation, they far less regard, and
for the most part pass them over.

4. That in afflicting punishments there is more respect to the persons
hability, what he is able to pay, then the amendment of his life, the Lord
knows it.

5. That they generally suffer foul abuses in the Church, not conscionably
seeking a redress thereof, which yet are in their power to reform, if they
would seriously as in Gods presence, take it into hand, and let petty matters
alone, and fall upon the removing of greater enormities, even reigning sins
which provoke God to wrath, in all sorts of persons; both of the higher degrce
(commonly let alone) and of the lower rank meddled with only for the purse
sake.

6. That they notoriously abuse generally all the people of the Land with the
name of the Church of England, undor which name they countenance themselves,
their Prelaticall power, and their own sole doings, which few take notice of,
but all may easily observe it in their proceedings, both before the convocation
gathered, in the time of the convocation, and after its broken up.

Before the Convocation.
1. One, the greatest, which aweth all the rest, with the assistance of two or
three Lording Spirits (such as care not to turn all upside down, so they may
be sure to hold their standing) consult of matters which they hold most fit,
and having concluded what to do within themselves, they propound them to the
rest of the Bishops their fearful brethren, who dare not but say as they say,
when they meet together, thus the Church begins.

2. To further their designs, Clerks in the Country, for the Convocation
house must be chosen, but not freely by the Ministers as they ought, but picked
out by the Bishops in their own diocese, such as they know will be sure
cards for them, and propound them to be chosen of the overawed Parsons and
Vicars who dare not for their cares gainesay them: and thus the Bishops make up
a Park for their Lord-ships purposes: having made ready their Clerks, they
call together their su pporters, all the D^s, all the Archdeacons, and who
else must be personally there in that Assembly, men known for the most part to
be very faithful to their Lordships honorable standing, to make up the
representative body of the Church of England. Thus they (the Church forsooth)
go to lay a sure foundation for themselves, before the Convocation be brought
together.

3. But here note, that the Church consists of the Laity, as well as of the
(...), Acts 15. ^, so as if the house of Parliament, lower, and upper, be not of
them, but secluded, they are not the representative body of the Ch^ of England,
but of the Clergy only, and the Prel^ Church.

In the time of their sitting.
1. All these Priests and Clerks sit there to gaz^ (...) upon another, and to
whisper of matters nothing o^ (...) to the purpose of their meeting, but wait
for their (...) from their Lordships, like School boys.

2. When they have received their directions, a bo^ se are so seiseth upon
almost all of them, as thereby thy are moved to agree to contradict nothing;
but if it so happen that some take courage (a rare virtue among them) for the
truth, and do oppose in some material things, which cross their Lordly
designements, Then,

3. Either they labor by a strong side, and more in number (for the greatest
and most are not ever the best) to make them yield, or to say nothing: or else
(to get their Canons pass) They devise a time, when the better sort, al or
most, are away, to finish the work, and thus the Church of England makes here
decrees to all her beloved children, but yet are of no force without an act of
Parliament:

After the Convocation is dissolved.
1. If any matter be not only in show questionable, but is justly to be
questioned, their Lordships by their sole wisdom in their several di^sse,
must interpret the meaning, and men must also rest satisfied, though the
meaning given be absurd, for its a folly to go from a Bishop to an
Archbishop, time has taught men their lost la^our therein.

2. If in time the One great one, and some two three, or four bethink
themselves of any course better befitting their secret plots and intentions, in
altering, in adding, or taking from, in any innovation whatsoever, then they
have ways to bear out all these their doings, with gaining help of Royal
declarations, and proclamations to bear them out, which being settled in peace,
then they become the orders allowed by the Church.

And thus may all wise men see, who are this Church of England; one with two,
three, or four of the diocesan Lord-Bishops, for they find it written, (with
clipping the text) that if two of them, much more three or four, with a body
of Ciphers, be gathered together and agree in the Convocation house touching
any thing, it shall be done. Mat. 18. 19.

O Lord open the eyes of our (...), both to see, and consider, and also to
(...) against these (...) Lord Bishops, to make them Bishops indeed, or else to
remove them, (...) very ill (...) the Church and State.

Let them fall by their own Councels, and let all the people of God say Amen.
