THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.
QVHEN I considerit the controversies rissin between yaim, quhilks call yaim
self Christianis, sum attempting to retain ye vain superstitiou^s quhilks
sue cedit to yaim fra yair Predecessors: sum alswa being in venters of new
sectis, schismis, and heresies: and the vthers of fewer number being inspyrit
and chosin of God, desiring to rute out the darkness of ignorance, to cause
schyne the licht of the treuth: it apperis to me that the may dangerous
poysone, quhilk Satan uses to poysone men with the venom of seditione, hes
been drawin out of the deip dungioun of the Mess, colourit with ane good end,
and couerit with good intention. And albeit that money haif trauelit greatly to
discover this rock of minds, be Descriptiouns, Anatomies, Centouns, Anatomies
of the mess Centouns and clamped pecis.
and Ingynes concerning the Mess: nottheles to vnderminde and contreminde,
ever mair and mair this fortress, quhilk semis vnwinnable, after I had red the
second volume of the Elassopolitane commentaries, quhilks treatis of the
number, dignity, power, riches and of the constitutions of greit Bischoppis,
hie Preistis and Sacrificers, sen the creatioun of the warlde, I haif drawin
ane compendious treatise of the Sacrifice callit the Mess. In this litil
treatise are declarit the halie signs, Sacrificis and Sacramentis ordenit be
God fra time to time, of the corruptiou^s croppin in successively in the Kirk
of God, and specially is descriuit the true original of the Mess, for quhilk
presently me^ are fallin in greit contentiouns and debaits: for sum inuey is
agains it as new forgit: other defend it be prescriptioun and lang possessioun.
Swa be sick altercatiouns, the Christien Kirk is troublit throch ye scurge of
seditioun. Bot gif thou haif patience (o faithful Reader) of quhat sect swaeuer
thou be, Papist or Euange^ist, as thou redis this brief discourse (tarying in
the mean time quhil thou may haif the buikis of the Commentaries in their
integrity) thou salt know trewlie quhat is the original of the Mess, partly
very ancient, and partly very new, quha are the founders thairof,
augmenters, Doters, and Patrons. And to the end, that thou may be assurit,
that the stories are faithfully gather it, that thou may haif recourse to the
authors, out of ye quhilks, yai are drawin, their Names and Buiks, are cotit
in ye margent. I will haulde the na langer, praying our good God to inspire the
after his halie will, throch ye intercessioun of our only Savior, Mediator,
and redemer Jesus Christ.

PErsauing money enemies daily rising aganis the treuth, willing to oppress
ye liberty of Christis Euagil, quhilk of his mercy, in yir our days he hes
causit schine in the warlde, and cheiflie ane named Niniane win^et, ane of the
Papist Preistis: quha hes laitlie causit set furthe in Print 83. Questions:
directit to the Caluiniane Preacheoures (as he tearmis thaim) amangis the
quhilks he mouis syndrie Questiouns, concerning the Mess: as gif yair be onie
Idolatry in it, with money others sicklike, preassing him be all means to
deck up yat Idol again to be estemit, and reuerencit as it hes been in times
past, to the quhilks Questiouns, laitlie commin in my handis: as I was
preparing my self, to make sum answer, because I understood the Papis men had
thaim in great estimatioun, and because nane of my brethren, as it I knew, had
trauelit in yat point. Behauld yis little tractat, set forth in french, was
schawin to me be ane faithful Brother, desiring me earnestly to take sum
travel, to translate ye same in our Scottis langage, ye quhilk as I was glaid
to reid, alswe^^ be ressoun of ye purpose contenit thairin, as of the man's
hailsume judgment, and dexterity in compyling ye same: swa was I laith to
interprise ye interpretatioune yairof, because I am swa occupyit in the daily
vocatioune that God hes callit me to, little leisure could I haif to ye
performing heirof, and alswa being not swa weil exercisit in ye french ^oung
as money vthers are, and yairfore glaidlie walde haif refusi^ ye charge.
Notwithstanding seeing yis tractat is sa proper, and perfect ane answer to
syndrie of ye said VVinzets Questiounis: and cheiflie sick as concerns ye
Mess, and ye impiety yairof: ea, as gif yai had been purposelie compylit to
that end. And alswa I finding ye commodity of sum oung men weill acquentit
with ye french tongue, quhais labouris releuit me ^^kle in yis behalf: I have
causit yis little Buike be set (...) in our Scottis tongue to make ye tr^uth
knawin to all our Country men, yat hes not ye knawlege of ye other leid, and
yat it may be partly ane answer to VVinzets Questiou^s. quhil ye compleit
answer be prepared for ye rest. Swa yat in my judgment, ye Papis men sal not
haif greit occasioun, god willing, to brag thaim self in this behalf. As to
they things yat are to be obseruit, be ye descreit reader heirin. Some tearmis
yair are quhilks can not be well turnit in another form, and significatioun,
bot as yai are vsit in other leidis: sick as the vestimentis yat ware vsit in
ye Mess, as chasible, Aimict, Aube, gradual. etc. and sick vthers. The quhilks
yairsore we haif lettin stand under ye same form, and significatioun, as
commonly yai are vsit. As to sum subtle interpretatiouns of ye Papis new
Theologis, quhilks ye author of yis Buik brings in to let ye vanity of ye
Mess, appeir the greater to all me^: we haif causit ye samin to be printit in
smaller letters, nor ye rest, quhilks are ye authouris awin wordis. And to sum
obscure wordis, we haif geuin two wordis for the interpretatioun of ane,
because ye ane micht appeir sum part strange to ye vnlearnit, and ye other

Thus mot thou fair weil in ye Lord Jesus Christ.

ANE BRIEF GATHERING OF THE HALIE SIGNS, AND SACRAMENTIS, INSTITVTIT of God,
sen the beginning of the warlde. And of the true original of the Mess.
IN the time preordinat be God, of his unsearchable and incomprehensible
wisdom, after he had created man to his awin Image and licknes, to the end to
steir him up to feir and obedience: alswa to gif him sum exercise in vertew,
to acknawlege God his maker: their war ordenit money Signs, Sacrificis, and
Sacramentis. First of all: to our forefather Adam, he and his successouris,
being corporal men, yair ware ordenit be God corporal signs to prove ye better
his obedience (to wit) treis planted in ye middis of ye gardin, and eardlie
paradise. Treis of life Gene. ^.1. Eusebius. Th^odor and Sever.
Their treis it albeit yai war of na other quality, nor other plantis,
notwithstanding yai being dedicatit and consecratit of God, to serve as
Sacramentis, yat is to say: halie signs, yair quality was yan dedicatit and
consecratit to serve as ane seal for witnessing, attestatioun, and approbatioun
of Gods will. For ye infinite gudnes of God, willing to make knawin ye
coniunctioun, confederacy, and conuenant maid with man his creature, formit to
his awin licknes, fra time to time, he hes ordenit to him outward and bodelie
Signs, quhilks man micht se and behauld with his corporal eine, to serve him
as ane assurance, plege, and Sign of Gods conuenant. Swa their was institutit
to our first and commoun Father, treis and corporal fruits, left and geuin to
him in keeping, without plucking, eating, or consuming of thaim, under pain of
Eternal death.

It behuisis than, to belief be faith, yat ye treis, and fruits were not
signis, or Sacramentis of vanity, as a simple Picture, prou. 1.2.3.
bot sen of yaim life and death dependit, yai contenit ye signis, and ye thing
signifeit, quhairin did stand ye knawlege and wisdom to feir God, and obey
him. And for this cause, war yai callit^ fruitis of knawlege of good and evil,
and treis of life, in yat, yat keeping yai frutis consecratit, in obaying of
God, was promisit life eternal.

Contrariwise in abusing ye Sacramentis, in gainstanding ye will of God,
declarit be ye outward signis, was purchassit death and eternal damnatioun.

sacrifices before ^he law ^^ittin.
For vthers exercisis of man towardis God, to ye end to reverence, honor, and
worschip him, money and diverse Sacrificis war celebratit: ea, euin before ye
Law writtin be Moses. And althoucht yat Almichtie God, maker of heuin and
eard, Psalm. 50.
hes na neid of man's warkis, seeing he is not nurishit of ye blude of beastis,
nor fruitis of the eard: nevertheless he hes alwayis desirit, to draw man to him
in feir and outward obedience, Gene. 4.
be signis, Sacrifices and Sacramentis, in sick sort, yat ye Sacrifices of
Lambs offerit be Abell, genesis 6.7.9. Hebr. 1^.
was acceptable unto God. Noah likewise afterward ye deluge of waters was
passit, in takin of acknawleging and obedience towardis God, he ^rectit ane
Alter, offerit and Sacrificit offerings of scheip without spot, and of fowls,
quhairof he maid a perfect Sacrifice pleasant to God. Be their examples it is
easy to knawe, yat ye Sacrifices began not in ye time of Moses; bot ye
innocent and just Lamb, representit be ye Sacrifice of Abel, ye sign of
Christ Jesus, to haif been slain and offerit sen ye beginning of ye warlde.

After the rigor of ye flude, yat come for ye punischment of the offencis of
ye tyrants of ye eard, Apocal. 13.
in sign of reconciliatioun and conuena^t renewit, our good God ordenit ye
sign of ye rain bow, Rain bow
in plege and assurance of his heavenly mercy. Ge^e. 9.
This sign and celestial bow, albei^ yat before it apperit in ye thick
cludis, being a^e takin of rain for to cum, notyeles, it had not been as it
markit and dedicatit to serve man, as a sacrament and halie sign unto ye time,
that it was be God ordenit for a takin of the conuenant contractit to the good
father Noah, and to his successouris.

To the faithful Patriarche Abraham, anuther confederacy and conuenant was
contractit be the wisdom of God, quha ordenit to him for ane plege,
Ctreumcisio^ in the ere of the warlde 2041.
and assurance of him and his posterity, ye outward sign of circumcision, to
serve him as ane sacrament and perpetual mark of Gods will: Genesis 17.
it was ordenit to him to cause circumcise ye mail childrin within ye aucht day
of their birth, under ye pain to b^ castin of, fra ye number of ye pepil
quhilk God had adoptit.

To the same pepil of Israel, was ordenit ye sacrament of the lamb immaculat,
The Paschal lamb.
the bluid of the quhilk being sprinklit, sold preserve the pepil fra ye death
destinat in Egypt: ye flesh alswa was ordenit to be eatin, Exodus 12.
and yairof to celebrat eirlie ye fest in ye day callit passover, in sign and
remembrance of the deliverance, fra the thraldom of Pharo: with the sign of
the conuenant of ye flesh of ye paschal lamb, it was ordenit yat they soulde
eat bread without leven for sevin days, under the pain of death.

Other halie signs war send of God to his chosin pepil, ever to draw yaim to
his fere and obedience, The clude the fi^tie pillar Exodus 13. The division of ye
Arabic sea in the ere of the warlde 2453. Exodus 14. 1. Co^. 10. Tit. 3.
as ye sign of the clud, a takin of ye way to gide ye pepil be day, the pillar
fiery and flamming, to conduct yem be nicht, out of the hands of ye tirant
Pharo. Afterward alswa ye sign of ye division of the read Arabik see, throch
the quhilk passit ye elect pepil of God. Be ye quhilkis marvelous signs God
wauld signify the halie sacrament of Baptism, thairafter ordenit be the sign
of the water, quhilk is ye wasching of regeneration, and renewing of the halie
Gaist.

During ye time, Celestial Manna. Exodus 16.

greit admiratiou^ yat every ane of the people said, MAN-HV: (that is to say)

Anuther marvelous sign was ordenit of God, be the rock flowing of lively

Sacrificis for sinnis, Sacrifice for ye sin of ignorance.

Mairatour ye hair of him quhilk maid ye oblation, aucht to be cast in in the
fire to be brunt with ye brunt offering.

Thus I thoucht good summairlie to ryn throch ye diversity of sacrificis, to
the end, to let understand ye great gudenes of our God, quha be the law of
sacrificis publis sit be Moises, wald retain as under a bridle, the rude pepil
of Israel, quhilk could not foret the idolatries of Egypt, Exodus 12.
quherein they had been nourissit four hundredth and threttie eris, under ye
tyranny of Pharonis. Bot quhat ever lawis of rigor, quhat ever ceremonies,
and sacrificis their war, quhilk had been ordenit to them, this pepil fell ever
agane into idolatries: abusing the law of God and corrupting ye halie
sacramentis, and sacrificis, as hereafter sal be rehersit. Gif any man desiris
mair at large to know the multitude, and diversity of sacrificis, let him read
the bu^is of Philo ye Iow, and Josephus in his Antiquities of the Iowis,
following that quhilk Moises has clearly writtin in ye buke of Leuit. and Numer.

Anuther sign and sacrament was institutit of God, be the ark of conuenant,
descriuit in Exodus: it being a sign consecratit and dedecatit, to resaue ye
halie oracles of heuin, to the end, to draw the pepil to remembrance, feir and
obedience of God. To honor and accompany the ark of conuenant, Ark of
conuenant. Exodus 25.26 27.28. Ephod.
money other outward signs war ordenit of God, as ye ornamentis and
consecrations of ye sacrificers, specially the ornament callit Ephod: the
quhilk and ye sacrificis the Israelitis abusit be their Idolatries.

Anvther halie sign, of the halie and clensing water, Halie cons^atit wa^ter.
Number. 19.
was ordenit of God, to Moises, and Aron the hie priest That halie water was
consecratit of aiss, gathrit be the man vnpollutit, of the best offrit in a
brunt sacrifice, to wit, of the read cow, hail without spot, not having been
put under onie labor. The fire for the consumit sacrifice, was ordenit of wud
of Ceder, of hissop, Exodus 30.
and of purpur crammoisie: with this water war sprinklit the men that were
unclean, for clensing and purging, of their corporal spottis. At the entry of
the tabernacle or tempil was a lawer of bras, forgit first of glassis of the
women of Israel, in that lawer or bass^ne, was put the halie water, quhere with
ye sacrificers sprinklit thaim self, before they celebratit their sacrificis,
to the end, that they micht be purifiit and obtain grace, and forgiveness of
sinnis.

After the death of the hie priest Aron, the pepil of Israel unthankful
towardis God, Serpent of bras. Number. 21. Io^. 3.7.
for the benefit send to yame, murmuring as fashit with celestial manna, to
yame frelie given for their fude, war punissit with the bit of venomous
serpents. Bot God being merciful, gave to yame a halie sign to be preseruit
and restorit unto health: to wit, ye sign of ye serpent of bras, erectit in ye
air, a figure of Jesus Christ crucifiit.

This is in sow me, the gretest part of signs, sacrificis, and sacramentis
institutit of God, in the first Kirk of ye Israelits, figuris of the true and
perfect sacrifice, endit be Jesus Christ, ye true Messiah, everlasting priest,
sitting at ye richt hand of God his father.

Now it behuifis summairlie to deduce, how man be his a win salt, is fallin in
oblivion and disobedience, aganis God his creator, The Sacrament brokin be
Adam. Gene. 1.
abusing ye favor of God, and corrupting ye halie Signs, Sacrificis, and
Sacramentis ordenit to him. Quha perswadit our first Father, and his fellow, to
hide thaim ye voice of God being hard, except yat yai had abusit ye halie
Sign, and brokin ye Law of ye fruitis, forbiddin to yaim? This halie Sign,
quhilk our first and universal Father had abusit, hes been ye original of other
vicis, and corruptiouns, heir afterward discriuit quhairin all men are fallin,
smelling of ye lomp corruptit in Adam.

Leuing ye particular corruptiouns of Signs. Sacrificis, and Sacramentis,
before ye Law writtin be Moises: we sal begin to deduce summarlie, ye may
notable errouris committit be ye may principal Sacrificers, Kings, Priests,
and vthers having ye ouersi^ht of ye people.

Than quhen Moises in ye mount of Sinay, soiournit to resaif ye Commandementis
of God, Corruption of Sacrificis he Aaron. Exodus 32. Deuteronomy. 9.

into ye pit of error, and corruptioun of halie signs, Sacrificis, and
Sacramentis, institutit to him of God. Bot ye principal abusis, of quhilks is
succedit, ye original of all Idolatry, are procedit of yis, yat men carnal
and corporal, dois rest yaim self mair in ye visibil signs, and outward
ceremonies, than in the things signifiit be ye Sacramentis: for in place to
circu^cise their hairtis, and cast of ye auld skin of sin, to be
regeneratit, and purifiit be ye blude of ye heavenly Sacrifice, offerit before
all warldis, yai haif taken ye circumcisioun carnally, for ye litil skin
corporal, yat is circumcisit. Quhy haif yai not followit ye interpretatioun of
God, be Moises, to circumcise ye uncircumcision of yair hairtis? Quhy gaif not
ye pepil of Israel faith to ye good Prophet, Jeremy, yat admonissit yaim of ye
spiritual circumcisioun, and to circumcise ye vncircumcisiou^ of yair hairt, in
casting of ye skin of yair corruptit nature.

The like is cume to pass of ye Sacrificis, and halie signs institutit of
God, for figuris of ye sacrifice consummat be Jesus Christ: for ye carnal man
dois rest him self in ye corporal, blude of eardlie beistis, quhair as he sold
lift up his Spirit^ to heuin, for to comprehend yat quhilk was figurit and
signifiit be ye oblatiouns of beistis offerit up. This is it quhairfore ye
justice of God is furthschawin be ye Prophetis: quhat neid haif I (say is ye
Lord God) of our Sacrificis? I am tyrit with ye offerings of scheip: mair,
Isay. 1.
I take na pleasure in ye blude of Oxin, of Lambis and gatis offerit: quhy

oblatiouns? I haif abhorrit our incensings: I can not suffer our new munis, uor
Sabbatis, our assembleis, and our Feiff is, all yat is bot vanity. I haif
taine in hatred our Feistis of new munis (o Israelits) and our celebratit
solemnity.

I am werie to haif sufferit samekil: e haif mekil ado, to dress our prayers
to me, I will heir ow na mair, for ye abusis yat e haif co^mittit with our hand

namair will I resaif of ye house of Israel onie bull, because ye Sacrificis are
not agreeable to me. Esaias. 66.
Alsmekil plesis me ye Sacrifice of ye Ox offerit up, as ye murder of ye slain

as ye worschipping of ane Idol. Quhairfore yan said God, take ow swa mekill

Quha hes mouit ow (o Israelits) to haif set up Imagis to ye Gods Moloch, and

God takis he pleasure in ye number of scheip offerit up to him, Mic. 6.
or in ye number of sacrat oillis, sall I offer to him (sayis ye Prophet) ye
first borne, for remissioun of sinnis? Our good God hes very cleirlie
declarit, yat quhilk he requir is, to follow equity, luif mercy, and with a
contrite hairt, to humbil our self before him, obedience is better yan

For in place to comprehend yat quhilk was figurit be ye signs and corporal
Sacrificis, yai restit yaim selfis in the flesche of beistis, offerit up: in
steid to circumcise ye vncircumcisioun of yair hairtis, yai restit yaim self in
the fleschlie circumcisioun, and in ye mean season, yai turnit thaim selfis
aback, fra ye true adoratioun of God, in turning yaim selfis to creaturis, as
to starnis, to ye Queen of heuin, and to vthers Gods being strangers, offering
to yaim incens, bilding to yaim Tempils, instituting to thaim Preistis,
Chaiplains, and Sacrificers, making to yaim oblatiouns, and celebrating
Sacrificis. Afterward alswa or ye heip of corruptiounis, yai maid S^crificis of

Sacramentis, sacrat signs and sacrificis ordenit of God, 4. Esd. 1.
it was said to ye pepil of Israel be ye Prophetis* yat God walde na mair of
yair Feistis, of yair new munis, of yair circumcisiouns, nor of yair

After ye vnserchabil wisdom of God, had knawin ye hardness and unfaithfulness
of ye pepil of Israel, yat continewit ever to commit Idolatries, be ye
corruptioun of halie signs, Sacramentis, and Sacrificis, and in place to
acknawlege ye infinite gudnes of God, yat had deliuerit yaim fra ye tirannie of
Pharo, yat had nurissit yaim in the wilderness, yat had broucht yaim into the
plentiful land promisit to yaim, and yat swa often tymis had succourit yaim in
weir aganis yair neichbouris, the Cananits, Moabits, Madianits, Philistines,
Ammonits, Siriens, Sidoniens and vthers inuyouris, and enemies. This rude pepil
did nevertheless continue to worschip Idolis, being instructit be ye Preistis,
Sacrificers, Princis, and Kingis, without reducing of thaim selfis, to the true
adoratioun of ane only God. For yis cause after the greit mercy and lang
tarying of the just luge, yat be all meanis of correctioun, had desire to draw
again his pepil, be heavenly peculiar vengancis, to wit, be ye weiris rasit,
be captiuitis, and bondagis, be ye diuisiouns of the Kingdom, partit between

again to his feir and obedience: in the end, 4. kin. 15.24
yis pepil over mekil hardnit and grow in auld in yair Idolatries, was led
again in miserabil bondage: under ye tyranny of ye unfaithful Assyriens and
Idolatrous Babiloniens, yair Kingdom altogether being put to nocht. Bot quhat
ever time after, yat yis same pepil be ye greit mercy of God, had been
deliuerit fra ye handis of unfaithful tyrantis, set again in liberty, Joseph.

and restorit in yair land promisit, yai sold again fall in Idolatry, mair
than ever under ye governance of yair Sacrificers, and hie Preistis, ye quhilks
ever did embrase temporal and spiritual aff^iris together, quhil yai had cled
yaim self, with ye sceptour and kingly Crown. Then succedit ye heresies of
Pharisees, Saducies, Essiens, Galileans, Masbuthians, Hemerobaptistis, and
Samaritains, corruptit be ye diversity of strange natiouns, having dwelt and
brocht under Zock, the country of Assyria, Samaria, neir to Judea. For ye
Babilonians worschippit for yair God, Soccobenoth, ye Cutheans of perse had for
yair God NERGAL, or NERGEL: ye Hemathians in callit on yair God ASIMA: ye
Ananois worschippit Nebahaze and Thartace: ye Sepharuaimia^s held for yair gods
AD RAMELECH and ANAMELECH, to quhilks Gods yai sacrificit yair childrin,
causing thaim pass throch ye fire.

Than quhan all kind of Idolatry was spread amang ye Israelits, yat ye

Bot euin as in Adam be his transgressioun, and for having abusit ye halie

performit ye ceremonial Law, and it being abolissit (as we hair deducit) be ye

two sacrat signs or halie Sacramentis: quhairin God hes vsit greter favor,
August. lib. 1. de doct. christ. cap. 9
and mair especial grace, nor he had done before his incarnatioun: because yat
he hes deliuerit us fra ye bound Law of circumcisioun, of ye distinctioun of
meatis, and of diverse sacrificis, ordenit in the first Kirk of ye Israelits,
and in discharging us of yat heavy burdin, he hes swa mekil mair releuit us,
in ordening to us for memory and remembrance of our regeneratiou^ and life
eternal, two halie Sacramentis under two halie signs, S^cramentis of the new
Testament.
to wit, ye water of Baptism, and ye breid and wine, for ye communion of his
body. Bot to ye end, to furthschaw his gracis, in all natiou^s it hes plesit
God to choose ye signs, or elementis may common and easy: for circumcisioun
was markit specially, for Abraham and his posterity, ye quhilk circumcisioun
other natiouns had not custume to use, albeit yat Herodotus be natioun a Greik,
Herod. lib. 2
be ye History quhilk he hes set out, of ye manners of Egiptians, Comparison of
circumcisioun to baptism.
attributis unto yaim ye custom of circumcisioun, specially the Sacrificers:
and it is very easy to conjecture, yat ya^ had hard speik of it, in ye time
that ye Iowis dwelt in Egypt, be ye space of 430. eiris observing
circumcisioun. Exodus 12.
Mairouer, ye circumcisioun was ordenit for ye maillis only, and not for ye
women: Gene ^^.
yair was a day appointit for ye circumcisioun, within ye 8. day of yair birth,
ye cutting of, of ye litil skinn, was with pain and dolor. Bot ye grace of
God, having abolissit be his incarnatioun and perfect Sacrifice ye rigor of ye
cerimonial Law, alsweil for ye distinctioun of meatis, as of dayis, hes left to
us be his new Testament, and new conuenant, ye halie sign of water common to
all, alsweil mail as femail, without distinctioun of dayis, and without yis,
yat be yis halie Sacrament, ye child baptisit feil pain, as he felt be ye
circumcisit skin. This sign of water, to represent to us ye purging and
clensing of our sinnis, be ye blude of Jesus Christ, was common, not only
ama^g ye Iowis, quha customit to use halie and clensing water, Number. 19.
bot alswa ye Gentilis, and all natiouns, had in use the purging, and wasching
of halie and clensing water, as it may be knawin be ye reding of ancient
Histories. To ye end yan, yat ye grace of God soulde be spread, generally
throch all ye world, in all natiouns, regiouns, and prouincis, alsweil of
circumcisit, as of vncircumcisit, alsweil of Iowis, as of Gentilis, it hes
plesit God to choose ye sign of water may common, to acco^modat him self
swamekil ye mair to man, to draw him into feir and obedience, be ye quhilk
sign, he hes institutit his halie Sacrament of baptism, for a takin and
assurit mark of our regeneratiou^ and purificatioun, representit
Sacramentallie, be ye vertew of ye halie Gaist, in ye quhilk Sacrament, God hes
assurit us to assist yairin, for to impe and regenerat us in Jesus Christ,
Math. 28. Tit. 3. gala. 3.
to be maid and renewit members of his members, and to resaif us as cled and
incorporat again in him, and by him.

Like ressouns a man may deduce for ye other halie Sacrament ordenit of God, be
his new Testament, to wit, of bread and of wine: of quhilks signs, elementis,
The Sacrament of ye halie Supper of Jesus Christ.
or notabil takins, all natiouns war wount to use in yair Sacrificis,
offeringis, and ceremonies, concerning yair religiouns, and ye circumcisit, and
ye vncircumcisit, ye Iowis and ye Gentilis. And alswa ye two kindis of fudis
for ye nurissing of m^n, are comprehendit under ye bread and ye wine, for yir
causis our good God, desiring to draw to him all natiouns, to nurisse yaim,
and minister to yaim may necessary fude, hes institutit ye communion of ye
body, and of ye blude of our Savior Jesus Christ, under the elementis, halie
signs, and Sacramentis of bread and wine. Now euin as he hes assurit us be ye
mark and bage of ye water of Baptism, to be regenerat, and renewit in ye
body and blude of Jesus Christ, representit be ye Sacrament of yat halie
water, be ye vertew of ye halie gaist: swa are we nurissit be ye communion of
his body, and of his blude, representit reallie, be ye bread and wine,
consecratit for meat and spiritual nurisment everlasting, and making quick be
ye vertew of ye halie Gaist. In quhilk God hes done to us yis great favor, yat
he hes dischargit us of ye bludie sacrificis, ordenit in ye first Kirk of ye
Israelitis, yat were wount to be chargit with money and diverse sacrificis,
celebratit with ye sched blude of eardlie beistis, according to ye diversity
of offencis, and of personis having sinnit. Heb. 9.
All ye quhilk sacrificis war perfitit, and abolissit be ye sched blude, of ye
just and innocent lamb Jesus Christ, quha be his perfect sacrifice, hes
altogether distroyit ye other sacrificis, having reseruit unto him self ye
dignity of ye great and eternal Priest, sitting at the richt hand of God his
Father. Bot he hes borne us swa great savor, yat in place of abolissit
sacrificis, he hes ordenit ye two halie Sacramentis heirtofore reheirsit, for
certain assurance of our regeneratioun, our purgatioun. our adoptioun, our
nurisment, and life eternal, geuin to us be ye blude of our Savior Jesus
Christ.

quha bade ointe the bairnis, to Baptize the halie sign of water institutit be
ye hand of God, Epipha. lib. 1. t^m. 3. here is. 34.
was it not sufficient aneuch, to represent ye precious blude of Jesus Christ,
for our regeneratioun, and purificatioun, without mixing of Creische, of
oillis, of spattil, and vthers minglingis, inuentit be ye corrupters of
Sacramentis? The body and blude of Jesus Christ, quhair with we are cled
again be ye halie water of Baptism, was it not sufficient aneuch, for to haif
preseruit us aganis all temptatiouns, without borrowing of Biginets, and
Chrismelets, or Chrismecloutis. And for anuther greter corruptioun and abuse,
it hes been permittit to women to baptize following ye error of ye
Marcionistis, Epipha. lib. ^. tom. 3. he^es. 42. et (...). 2 tom. 1. h^^es. 48.
Quintilians, Cataphrygis, Montanistis, Pepuzians, Priscillians, and
Artotyritis. Was it permittit be ye Law of God, to women to minister ye halie
Sacramentis, or Sacrificis ordenit in ye first Kirk of ye Israelits, or be ye
new Testament of Jesus Christ? In ye story of Moises it is reheirsit, yat his
wife Sephora, mouit with feminine furour, tuik a stain or knife, quhair with
sche circumcisit her a win child. Bot it is not writtin, Exodus 4.
yat sche nor her likis had been ever permittit to minister ye halie
Sacramentis. Be sick corruptiouns of ye halie sacrament of Baptism, yair hes
been rasit money heresies, be ye Katabaptistis, Anabaptistis,
Antipedobaptistis, and vthers heretikis and schismatikis, quha contentit not
yaim self, of ye pure and sincere ordinance of God, rather resting yaim selfis
in ye outward signs, yan in yt quhilk was representit be yaim in Spirit. Quha
will desire to know mair particularly, ye abusis and corruptiouns inuentit in
syndrie tymis, be diverse humouris of men, let him reid our ecclesiastical
commentaries. It restis now to descend to ye corruptiouns of ye other halie
Sacrament of ye Supper, and communion of ye body and blude of Jesus Christ.

Be yis summaire discourse it may be cleirlie knawin, how mekil man is variant,
and fragil, having ever abusit the gracis of God. Bot euin as ye pepil of
Israel, sen ye beginning of ye Law, and institutioun geuin to yaim, hes
corruptit ye true use of ye sacrificis, halie signs and Sacramentis, ordenit
of God, swa is cum to pass of ye law of God, Sacrament of ye Supper corruptit
1. Cor. 11.
be Jesus Christ having institutit ye form to communicate his body, and his
blude, under ye elementis, and halie signs of bread and wine. The quhilk halie
Sacrament, hes been abusit sen ye very time of ye Apostils, be y^ Corinthians:
aganis quhame ye halie Apostil hes writtin Epistils, to ye end, to bring yaim
again to the true and sinceir keeping of yis balie Sacrament. Let na man yan
heirafter find it strange, gif ye successouris of ye Apostils haif fra time to
time corruptit ye true use of yis halie Sacrament. And swa mekil mair as yai
haif been far of fra ye time of ye Apostils of Jesus christ, swa mekil mair are
yai fallin in corruptiouns, ea abhominabil, turning ye use of ye Sacrament into
a puddil of Idolatry. In histo. eclesiasti.
In ye first place, in quhat contentioun fell ye Kirk yat was nerest ye
Apostils, for ye appointment of dayis to celebrat yis halie Sacrament?
Sabbatius ye heretic ordenit ye celebrating of ye passover, with vnleuenit
bread, Histo. tripar tita. lib. 9. cap. 37. lib. 11. cap. 5.
after the manner of ye Iowis. Sum of his sect ordenit ye use of yis halie
Sacrament to be celebratit in ye fourtent mune, euin as did ye Iowis. Eusebius.
lib. 5. Cap. 24.
Of yis sect it was said policrates ye Bischop of ye Ephesians to be, Philip
Hieropolitaine, Policarpus, Truscas, Melitus, and Narcissus Bischop of
Jerusalem: of ye contrare opinion, Histo. trip. lib. 9. Cap. 3^. et. 39.
was victor Bischop of Rome, and Eleutherus his predecessor, and Theophilus
Bischop of Palestina. This contentioun contine wit mair yan three hundredth eiris
after ye Apostlis. Sum other celebratit ye passover after ye Equinox, quhen ye
Sone entrit in ye sign of Aries: sum vthers obseruit ye month Xanthik,
callit be ye Romans April. Sum said (to wit ye Quartodecumans) yat yai war
instructit be S. Iohne, to celebrate in ye fourtent mune. The Romans braggit
yaim self to haif been taucht be S. Peter, and S. Paul, quhair of nevertheless
yair is na apperance. The Phrigian Montanistis, condamnit ye Quartodecumans,
obseruers of ye course of ye mune. And yat it behuisit to reule thaim after ye
course of ye sone, to begin at ye Equinox of ye spring time. For yis cause yai
celebratit ye 8. of ye Idis of April, quhilk was ye fourtent day of ye said
month, providing yat it fell on Sunday.

Not only was yair controversy for ye use of yis halie Sacrament, in ye
dayis appointit to celebrate it: bot alswa yair was great diuisioun amang ye
Christians, Eusebius. lib. 5. Cap. 24.
for ye inuentit ceremonies, for to prepaire yaim to resaif it worthelie. For
sum as ye Romans kepit fasting three oukis before Pasche, ye Illyriens and all
Grecia, ea, alswa ye Alexandriens ordenit a Lentrene to fast for sax oukis:
sum alswa ordenit 7. oukis of abstinence with intermissioun fra five dayis, to
five dayis.

Anuther Iowisse cerimonie was restorit, to mair and mair corrupt ye halie
Sacrament of ye Supper be ye distinctioun of meatis. Histo. trip. Cap. 38.
For sum forbade during ye fasting to eat flesche nor fische: sum other
forbade ye use of flesche only permitting to eat fische, and foulis, quhilk
they said according to Moises ware partakers of ye substance of water. Sum
alswa ordenit to eat dry bread and water only: sum alswa fastit unto nune,
without distinctioun of meatis. And summarlie to resolve yis, yair was in ye
beginning ane infinitnes of customis and corruptiou^s in ye use of ye halie
sacrament of ye Supper, Coloss. 2. Gal. 4. Heb. 7.
be ye restorit ceremonies of ye distinctioun of dayis and of meatis; abrogatit
be ye grace and Law of Jesus Christ. Bot hes yair ever been ane halie Apostil
of God, yat ever hes left be write onie Law or ordinance, for ye distinctioun
of dayis or of meatis, to celebrate ye halie Supper of Jesus Christ. Their
purpose was not to ordain a religioun of Feistis, a distinctioun of dayis and
of meatis, bot only yair doctrine tendit to instruct to live weill, and how
ane only God soulde be worschippit. Quhairfore it behuifis necessarily, to
infer ye cerimonie and Feist of Pasche, to celebrate the Supper of ye Lord our
God* Histo. tripar. lib. 9. Cap 38.
to be procedit be a custom, for nane of ye Apostils left onie thing of yat be
write.

To moderat sick dissentiouns and corruptiouns, money Counsels war gatherit,
ane at Sangarie of Bitinia, be ye quhilk to eschew all contentiouns, it was
permitit to every ane to celebrate ye Pasche quhan he wald. Eusebius. lib. 5 Cap*
(...)
Anuther Counsel was haldin in Cesaria be Theophilus, Bischop of yat place, and
be Narcissus Bischop of Jerusalem. Anuther Counsel in Achaia, anuther Counsel
was haldin at Rome be Victor Bischop of yat place.

After ye final corruptiouns, yair succedit vthers greter fra time to time,
according to ye humouris and affectiouns of ye Bischoppis of Rome. Alexander
first of that Name being cume to ye ouersicht of ye Kirk f Rome, In the ei^ of
God. 114
os ye first successouris to ye Apostils of Jesus Christ, Plati. Sabelli.
and alswa of ye first corrupters of the halie sacrament of the Supper inuentit
to mix water with ye wine, before they sold communicate. Quhairin he walde haif
reformit the halie Euangil of Jesus Christ, quha had not institutit the
communion of his body, and of his blude, except under ye two kindis of bread
and wine, bot Alexander yair to hes addit ye thride kind, to wit, water. He
restorit alswa the Iowisse cerimonie of tharfe bread, yat is to say, without
leven: to celebrate ye Passover, euin as ye Iowis did: Following yairin ye
opinioun of ye Ebionitis, that taucht ye ceremonial Law of Moses, to be
neidful to saluatioun, as alswa Symmachus ane heritike in Palestina had taucht.
Eusebius. lib. 3 Cap. 27. lib. 6. Cap. 14.
Gif Jesus Christ hes been circumcisit to accomplisse ye eternal Law, is it
yairfore necessary to use circumcisioun? And alswa gif it plesit him for to
fulfill ye law of ceremonies, to use in ye vnleuenit dayis, bread with out
leue^, is it yairfore neidful to return unto ye rigor of ye cerimonie,
abrogatit be ye sacrifice, perfitelie endit be Jesus christ. In quhat place of
ye halie Eua^gil Alexander could he haif learnit to mix water with wine? And to
astrict Christians to vnleuenit bread, na mair nor his inuentioun to chaise
away devils with salt water coniurit. Cael. lib. 30. cap. 21.
As to ye saltit halie water institutit be him, we sall deduce ye original
yairof fra Numa pompelius, ye great Magicien heirafter, and Roman Idolater.
Bot as to ye mixing of ye water with wine he micht haif been instructit of ye
religioun of ancient Idolaters, yat vsit in celebrating yair sacrificis, in a
cup to consecrat water with bread specially in ye Feist dedicatit to ye sone,
quhilk ye Persians worschippit be yaim, callit Mythros: and in ye Feist of
Nephalies, yair was alswa vsit water for sacrifice. To yis comparisoun Justinius
Martyr refers ye custom obseruit amang ye Idolaters, Justin. in apol. 2.
and amang ye Christians, for ye bread, wine and water consecratit: be ye anes,
to wit, be ye Idolaters in ye name of their Idolis, and be the Christians in
the Name of their true God. Notwitstanding yis first corruptioun in ye use of
ye halie sacrament, be ye mingling of water with wine, beside ye commandment
and ordinance of God, Innoc. lib. 4. cap. 5. de offic. mis.
baid not without controversy, for ye Grecians war of ye contrary opinion,
yat it was not neidful to mix ye water with ye wine, and yai walde not follow
ye corruptioun of Alexander. Amarcanus was of yat same opinion yat Alexander,
saying ye mixing of ye water to be neidful yairin. The crafty and sophistical
SCOTVS did absolutely deny ye water to be neidful to be mixit with wine:
because (said he) yt it could not be cha^git nor transubsta^ciatit into blude,
gif first it war not cha^git into wine. Sum vtheris mair ingenious hes plesit
to interpret ye institutiou^ of Alexander, saying ye wine to be turnit into
blude: bot as to ye water to be transubstanciatit into ye water, yat procedit
out of ye side of Jesus Christ.

August. lib. de here. cap. 26. and 64.
This first corruptioun of Alexander, gaif occasioun of money other abusis ye
succedit: for vtheris greter corrupters inuentit to mix blude drawin of oung
babis, for to mingil with ye bread of ye halie Supper of Jesus Christ, as ye
Kataphrygiens, yat began a kind of transubstancia tiou^ of wine into blude
reallie and bodelie. Epipha. (...) 2. to ^^. 1. be 4^.
Sum other thairto eikit cheis callit ARTOTIRITES, yat is to say, minglers of
bread and cheis. Sum alswa abusing yis Sacrament, in place of wine subrogatit
water, under pretext of greter abstinence. Vthers haif institutit to steipe ye
bread in ye wine, ye quhilk ye Mesmongers hes it reteinit in yair sacrificis of
ye Mess.

For anuther mair detestabil corruptioun of yis halie Sacrament, sum
Bischoppis of Rome hes forbiddin yair sacrificers, Mesmongers, not to minister
to ye Christian pepil, quhilk yai call laike ye body of Jesus Christ, Council.
constan. se^. ^^
under yet wa kindis, bot only under ye halie sign of bread, and not of
wine: quhilk yai haif reseruit for ye Preistis, Mesmongers, Sacrificers. This
corruptioun is it not directly aganis ye halie Gospel, and institutioun of ye
Supper of Jesus Christ, quha hes ordenit and commandit all faithful to eat his
body and drink his blude? Q^han he tuik ye cupe, did he not use yir same
proper tearmis, drink all of yis wine, in memory and remembrance of my blude
yat is sched? Hes he vsit other tearmis to eat his body be ye element of
bread, yan to drink his blude be ye sign of wine? Bot gif it behuisis to
compaire the ha^ie sign ordenit of God, in ye Kirk of ye Israelitis, Mat. 26.
Marc. 14. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 10
ye figure of ye communion of ye body of Jesus Christ, quhilk was ye Paschal
Lamb, quhairof it was ordenit to eat the flesche without exceptioun of
personis, swa yat yai had been circumcisit, was yair ever onie difference in ye
eating of ye Paschal Lamb, and celebratioun of ye passover amangis ye Iowis,
between ye Leuits of ye raice of sacrificers, and ye laiffe of ye common pepil?
For anuther detestabil corruptioun, ye Mesmongers hes institutit be yair
Idolatry of ye Mess, to sacrifice and offer ye body and blude of Jesus
Christ, in renewing be yat meanis ye sacrifice perfitlie endit be Jesus Christ
quhilk can not be retraitit: because yat he was not after ye manner of Aaron,
bot of Melchisedech, ane eternal sacrificer, without leui^g of any successor.
And alswa quhen ye halie Apostil admonissit ye Corinthians to celebrate halie
ye Supper of Jesus Christ, 1. Cor. 11.
commandit he yaim to Sacrifice it? Na: bot to eat and communicate together ye
body, and drink ye blude of Jesus Christ. The beginning of ye halie Supper is
not to slaie or offer up, or sacrifice ane oblatiou^ to offer it to God: bot
only to eat and drink in ye halie Feast preparit to us be Jesus Christ, ye
eternal sacrifice, and everlasting sacrificer: quha hes reseruit to him self
only yis eternal sacrificing, and nevertheless hes left to us his halie
institutioun of ye banquet, ordenit to us of bread and of wine, representing his
body and his blude.

After ye foresaid corruptiouns, Satan a diligent master of warke Babilonical,
hes display it all his power, to big ane vnwinnabil fortres of Idolatry, to ye
end, to vainquisse, and cast down altogether ye Kingdom of Jesus Christ,
quhan he interprisit ye bilding of ye Mess, to be subrogatit in ye place of ye
halie sacrament of ye Supper: as we sall deduce summarlie, and swa cleirlie,
yat ye may hardenit Pharos, growin auld in yair ancient Idolatries, sal
acknawlege be ye verity of stories, their errouris and abhominabil heresies.

Before we paint forth ye labirinthe of error, quhair ye Mesmongers haif
drownit yaim selfis, it semit to me to be neidful summarlie to discus ye
ancient Religioun of the Romans, of ye Kingdom of ye west Empire, and of
Emperouris having exercisit ye temporal governance, and ye dignity of great
Bischoppis, Superintendentis of ye Religioun and Romain Kirk. All alsweil as I,
will confess ye Romain Religioun, to haif been altogether, or for the may
part, institutit be Numa Pompilius, second King of ye Romans, Tit. Liu. lib 1.
decad. 1. Fenestel. lib. de mag. romans
about 700. eiris before ye incarnatioun of Jesus Christ. Tha^ war institutit
ye Bischoppis, quhilk sen syne war reducit to a certain number, unto four:
afterward ye number augme^tit unto aucht, and be Sylla unto fiftene. In ye
college of ye Bischoppis, their was ane great Bischop, quha was chosin be other
smaller Bischoppis, out of yair ordour and dignity: swa yat ye small
Bischoppis, purpurit Cardinallis, hes practisit ye electioun of ye great
Bischop of Rome, out of yair stait, ordour and dignity. This Pompilian
Religioun hes been swa weil obseruit be ye Romans, fra ye father to ye Sone,
yat it hes never been possibil to be pullit out of ye flesche, nor plukit away
be ye rute: bot hes been continewit unto yis present day, as every man sall
know before his eine be yis litil traitise.

To confirm yis point, na man may be ignorant, gif he hes plesit reid ye
Romain histories, yat before ye in carnatioun of Christ, yair hes not been ane
only King, Consul, Dictator, or Romain Emperor, instructit in ye Law of God,
bot all haif been Idolaters and unfaithful, following ye Religiou^ of ye
Magicien Numa pompilius. That sen ye incarnatioun of Jesus Christ, during ye
space of 300. eiris, or yairabout, yair hes not been alswa onie Emperor or
Consul of Rome, yat walde change his Religiou^ to res^if ye Law of Jesus
Christ, bot in ye contrare, Eusebius in libris historiae ecclesi. The eir of

yai haif put forth all yair micht and power, to exercise all sea it is of
creweltie aganis ye Kirk of Jesus Christ. Quhilk iustefies ye self be ye

Being yan Emperors and hie Preistis, yai had never permittit anuther head yan

quhen ye Apostils preachit Christ to be chief Priest, great and eternal
Sacrificer, without successor, after ye ordour of Melchisedech, ye tyrantis of

to diminisse ye authority of Cesaris, great hie preistis of Rome. Of quhat

yair Religioun to resaif ye Religioun of Jesus Christ? They schew again yat
yai war yan in possessioun, and yair war passit mair yan a thousand eir of yair
Pompiliane Religioun: yat ye mutatioun of Religioun, was ye cause of ye rewine
of all common welthis. For yir causis persisting in yair inueterat Roman
Religioun, yai stoppit yat yai resaifit not ye law of Jesus Christ. Be yir
histories it is easy to be resoluit, yat during 400. eiris, and mair, ye
Bischoppis of Rome, yat callit yaim self Christians, could never obtain of ye

Christians, and euermair resistit to ye Law of ye Euangil, to maintain yair
Pompilian religiou^.

Swa it behuifis to be resoluit, yat during 400. eiris ye Romain Kirk of
Emperouris and Senatouris, hes ever been contrarious and enemy to ye Law of
Jesus Christ. Than after ye Occide^tal Empire was brocht to nocht, during 300.
eiris or yairabout, yat Rome and all Italy was reulit and gouernit be Kingis,
Princis and Duikis, unfaithful and Idolatrous: to wit be ye Vandalians, be ye

Lu^bardie^s: swa yt during ye space of 700. eirs or yairabout son ye
incarnatiou^ of Jesus Christ, yair hes not been onie Emperouris, Kingis, Kingis
or Princis at Rome, yat ever walde haif embrasit ye Law of Jesus Christ. The
quhilk I haif thocht good summarlie to deduce, to ye end yat ye Reader find
not strange, gif I haif deducit ye Sacrifice of ye Mess, to haif taken ye
beginning fra ye ancient Religioun, institutit be Numa Pompilius, mai^ yan 700.
eiris before ye incarnatioun of Jesus Christ, and yairafter alswa, yis same
sacrifice, hes been continewit be ye Idolatrous Romans, growin auld and
hardnit in yair Pompilian religion, quhilk they walde never give over.

Bot to ye end, yat nathing be hid of ye Romain histories, yat may darkin ye
cleirnes of ye verity: during the tyranny and vsurpatiouns of ye forsaidis
natiouns, in Italy yair was erectit ane litil exarchat or dominion at Raue^na,

quhilk was co^tinewit about 183. eirs until yt it was rest be a Bischop yat

Bischop of Rome, yat spoilit ye true airis of ye Kingdom of France, to wit,

Kingdom fall to ye said Pepin, Sone of Charles Martell ye bastard. This
donatiou^ of Pepin, in yis wise maid to ye Bischop of rome, was ye first
beginning of ye gretest of Roman Papis, quha hes retenit unto yis day yis

In ye mean time yat yis litil exarchat was continewit at Rauenna, lang time

This preface and Summaire discourse of ye Roman history, hes semit to me to

OF THE MESS.
TO begin our litil treatise of ye Mess, first of all it behuisis to
interpret ye term of ye Mess, of ye Ancient Romainis call it Missa.
Original of ye term of Mess.
Sum haif honourit yis Sacrifice of ye Mess, to haif taken ye beginning fra
the Hebrewis, inducing ye place of Daniell, speking of Maozin, as gif yai walde
signify ye Mess, Daniel. 11.
be Maozin. Bot yis term is very far of fra Missa, or Mess, and yair is
Hebrew tearmis far mair approaching, 4. King. 11. Messa. Joshua. 19. Messal.
Messell. Hell
to wit, (...) Messa, yat is alsmekil to say, as stra^ping down, of quhilk
term is mentioun maid in the History of ye Kingis of Israel. Ane other
term alswa is found in ye Hebrew, aggreabil aneuch to ye co^moun term of
Messel, to wit, (...) yat is to say, hell or graif. Bot I dout not bot ye great
Bischoppis of Rome, walde not take yair original of ye Mess fra ye Hebrewis,
to acknawlege yair Mess, and yair Messel, to be a conculcatioun, a hell or
graif. And alswa of a treuth, ye author of ye Roman Religioun Numa
Pompilius, thocht never on ye Hebrewis, quhan first he institutit his Mess. it
les this term of Missa, or Mess, can be begone of ye Greikis: because yat
yair is na Sacrifice of yat Name, how beit yat sum haif brocht in sum ressone
of yis term (...) Myzein, yat is to say i^. Scottis, to hide or keip close,
as gif ye Mess Preistis had retenit of ye ancient Greikis, Idolaters, to keip
close ye principal tearmis of yair Messis, yat yai sold not be understand be
yaim yat stuid by: bot haif obseruit to quhisper, and blaw amang yair teith,
yair canons and sum special wordis, quhilk no there yai understand, nor yai yat
luik on yaim. Neueryeles, another ye Hebrew tearmis, nor ye Greik wordis, can be
altogether apply it to ye Sacrifice of ye Mess. Quhairfore it behuifis to
rinne again to ye true original of ye term Missa, The Mess drawin fra ye
ancient latin romans
or Mess, drawin fra ye ancient latin Romans, quhilks war wount to use yir
tearmis, Missus, Missa, Missilis et Missio, as we say in Scottis, Messinger,
Message and Missiuis, for letters yat are sent. Quhan yan ye ancient Roman
Idolaters, Apud Grecos Sacerdos functus mysterio sic re^untiabat: la ois
aphesis: quasi populu^ missum face ret. Apul li. 11. de Asin ^ur.
walde gif yair leif to yaim that stuid by, at yair Sacrificis being done, yai
causit pronounce in ye end yir wordis, I, licet, Missa est, ga thy way it is
permittit, ye assembly is send to ga haime. Bot in ye process of time,
because yt yis sang signifiit a leif acceptabil to ye pepil, to be send to yair
housis, as of a sang and term may recreatif, it hes been retenit, and ye
Sacrifice honourit of yis term Missa. To confirm yis point, yair are passit
two thousand eiris, ye same tearmis are it su^g unto yis present, Ite, Missa
est: quhilk signifiit a leif geuin, and ye company or assembly to be send to
ga haime: in sick sort, yat cum yai quhilk frequentis ye Kirks, as sune as yai
understand yis acceptabil sang, Ite, Missa est: yai are seen ordinarlie to
walkin, and to be full of joy, as being assurit, yat yai haif leif to ga dyne.

The Arabian Mahometistis, a lang season instructit of ye Monk Sergius, as we
haif deducit, In ye Buik of ye discriptioun of Africa be John Lion African.
hes yis term of ye Mess in great recommendatioun, with quhilk term yai
haif honourit three townis or cities, callit Missa, situat upon ye cost of ye
Occean See, under ye point yt makis ye beginning of Mount Altas. Besydis yir
townis, in the Faubouris, Messa of ye Turkis.
yair is a Tempil gretelie reuerencit be ye Idolatrous Turkis, because yt yai
belief yat out of Missa sold be borne ye just Bischop, Messalamis
promisit and propheciit be Mahomete. They belief alswa, yat upon ye schore of
the said place of Messa, Jonas had been castin, In ye buik of ye court of ye
great Turk be freir antonie Gueffroy.
after he was swallowit be ye quhail. They haif alswa yis Name of Messalamans,
in als great honor as we haif ye Name of Christians, as willing signify be
yis name Messalama^ sauit.

Mairouer ye Mahometistis hes alswa honourit yair preistis with ye Name of ye
Mess, calling yaim Messen, In ye foresaid buik, Messen. Messit.
and yair Kirkis callit Messit, o^ Meschit. They yan quhilk preasit yaim self
to put in licht ye Anatomy of ye Mess, ye Centons, ye foundamentis, growingis
and decoratiou^s, thairof aucht to haif writtin of it with great reverence, in
respect of ye ancient Pompilian Religioun, and Alkoranik of Mahomet.

After yat we haif resoluit ye Name of ye Mess, and of Missa, in Roman
langage to be begone of ye ancient Roman Idolaters, and not of ye Hebrew is
nor of the Grecians, it behuifis to descend to ye vestimentis of the Mess
Preistis. Bot in passing, we may not foret ye name of (Bischop) begone alswa of
ye Romans, as we haif declarit in our Commentaries. Lib. 1. Commentaries.
The Name alswa of Pape begone of ancient Idolaters, quha vsit to incall yair
God Jupiter, Pape.
calling him Papa Jupiter, specially ye Bithiniens and Scythiens, ye quhilk
Name of Pape is drawin out of ye Greik term (...) Pappus, Herod. lib. 4
yat is to say, great father. And alswa ye true titil subscriuit in ye
requestis presentit to ye great Bischop of Rome, is may blissit Father, and
of ye smaller purpurit Bischoppis m^ist Reverend father, and of ye litil
Bischoppis Reverend Father, having all retenit yis Name of Father, or of Pape,
Great Father, quhilk vsit to be a Name commoun to all Bischoppis.

Than afterward ye great Bischoppis of Rome reseruit it for yaim only. Their
is alswa ane Name retenit for ye smallest sarie Bischoppis, callit Curatis, yat
are overseers in every paroche, Curio Sacerdos ane Curat, qui in sua c^ria, id
est, in su^ parrochia sacris praeerat. Tit. liui. lib. 1. Decad. 1.
having borrowit yis Name of Curate fra ye ancient Roman Curions, gif ane man
wald not deduce ye Etymology yairof fra ye Greik term (...) choura, yat is
to say, schauing or clipping, because yat ye ancient Curions and Sacrificers
vsit, clipping, and ye heid schauin, after ye manner of ye Babilonians, or
Herculian Bischoppis, callit for yis cause, Stephanophori, as bering ane crown
upon ye head. Neueryeles it appearis to me, yat seeing all ye members of ye
sacrifice of ye Mess haif yair beginning of ye Pompilian Religioun, Tit. Liui.
Fen stel. Pompo. Let.
yair walde be wrang done to ye ancient Roman Idolaters, gif fra yaim me^
wald take away ye original of ye Namis of ye Mess, of Bischop, and of Curate:
as it is iustifiit be ye Roman histories.

Aube. Alex. ab Ale lib. 4. Cap. 17.
As to ye vestiment of ye Mesmonging Preistis, Numa institutit yat it sold be
quhite, callit be a Latin term, Alba, Aube, ye quhilk Name os Aube, hes been
unto yis day retenit for ye vestiment of ye Priest saying Mess: Super Tunicam
aeneam pectori tegumen. Tit. liui li. 1. Decad. 1.
abuif ye Aube was alswa ordenit to ye Sacrificer, to beir a cote paintit with
culloure, and abuif ane ornament of a pectoral of brase or of copper, yairafter
changit into gold or silver, Chasubil.
quhilk ye Mesmongers haif callit chasubil.

They vsit alswa a vail to cover yair head in Sacrificing, callit Aimict, first
institutit be Eneas. Virgil. libr AEn. 3. purpureo velare comas ado pertus
amictu Et capita ante aras ^^tygio velamus amictu.
Their are ye principal vestimentis institutit be Numa 700. eiris before the
incarnatioun of Jesus Christ. True it is, yat sensyne yair hes been mixit
decoratiouns judicial, as ye stoile, the Ephode, ye belt or girding, ye miter
or diadem, and sum other apparel, ye better to disgise ye great Babilonicall
hure.

Bot ye Mesmongers willing to disgise ye original of yair Mess clais, hes
imaginit ye aube, to figurat ye conuersatioun of Jesus Christ in his flesche,
or ye purity of his body, incarnat in ye waimb of ye Virgin. Vthers
interpret ye quhite color, to signify chastetie and continency. Vthers
willing to play fersis, and scorn ye Passiou^ of Jesus Christ, sophisticallie
vnderstandis be ye Aube, ye quhite gown presentit be Herod to Christ, quhan he
was send again^ as a fule to Pilat. The low Philo, ane may excellent
Philosopher, in his treatise of dreamis subtillie sayis, ye Aube to signify ye
surenes of ye bricht schining licht of God, yat he callis Ens. The linning
alswa of quhilk ye Aube is maid, yai interpret for ye subtilitie of ye
Scripturis. As to ye Aimict inuentit be Eneas, yai disgise it for ye vail,
quhairwith Christ was couer^it, yan quhan ye Iowi^ in ye house of Caiphas,
mocking yaim of him buffetit him. Titelman, ane of ye may subtle Mesmongers,
Titelman. in tracta. de exposit. Myster Missae. and Gabr. Biel. in lib. de
exposit. Missae.
sophisticallie sayis, be ye Aimict, to be figurit ye divinity of Christ, hid
under his humanity. Sum alswa confess ye Aimict to haif been subgrogatit in
ye place of ye Ephode of ye Iowis. The belt, ye Manipul, and ye stoile, quhilks
are three bandis, yai figurat ye three cordis, quhairwith Christ was bound, and
trailit before ye Preistis, and after, before ye lieutenantis of Rome in Judea.
Biel another subtle Mesmonger, interpretis be ye belt, ye wandis quhairwith
Christ was scurgit: be ye stoile spread forth in ye manner of a cross, to
signify ye gibet or Gallous, yat Christ bure upon his schoulders. The Manipule
alswa borne on ye left arm, ane figure of ye band of luif, quhairwith Christ
was retenit. Anuther mommerie be ye belt quhairwith ye Aube is trussit, to
signify ye band of ye luif of God. The stoile put upon ye Aimict, on ye neck
of ye Mesmonger in manner of ane Cross, is ye figure of ye obedience of Jesus
Christ, euin unto ye death of ye Cross. The Manipule borne in ye left hand, to
figurat ye reward of ye eternal felicity of Christ. Anuther sophisterie be ye
Aimict, to figurat Faith, be ye stoile humility of obedience, be ye Manipule,
ye watching and hairtlie deuotioun of ye Priest yat singis Mess. Titelman
subtillie sayis, vtherwise be ye Manipule in ye car hand to figurat ye strenth
and battle of Christ, aganis ye power visibil and vnuisibil, as a bucklet
aganis temp tatiouns, ye hotdouris of ye Manipul, to figurat a final
perseverance. He sophisticatis alswa be ye car hand, to be understand ye ma^lie
infirmity of Christ, ye quhilk being bound with ye Manipule, to figurat Christ
to be retenit as subdewit be ye divinity; Brunus alswa anuther Mesmonging
Doctor, Imaginis be ye Manipule ye caire of ye Mesmonging Priest, to chaise a
way evil affectiouns, or vtherwise to figurat ye cord, quhairwith Christ was
bound be ye Iowis, be ye story, to be figuratit, ye ok of ye Lord, yat ye
Mesmonger aucht to beir, garnissit with ye armor of justice on ye richt, and
on ye left side. The vthet paintit ornament, first institutit be ye Magicien
Numa, yai haif disgisit it with ye name of a planet, as ane erroneous
vestiment, vtherwise callit chape or Chasubil, quhilk yai sophisticat to
represent ye Purpur gown, presentit to Christ in ye Tolbuith of Pilate,
scorning him, and calling him king of Iowis. Anuther Sophisterie be sick a
vestiment to be figurit ye nature of Christ, quhair his Godhead was hid. Philo
a Jew of ye sect of Plato, interpretis be ye vestiment, ornit with diverse
cullouris to be ye figure of signs, and heavenly starnis. Bot ye Mesmonging
Priest orderit with his aube, and Aimict, with his belt, Manipule, stolis, and
his Chasubil, or Cape of diverse culouris, soulde put forth his arm to play
two personagis together, representit be ye Chasubil, quhairof ye part yat is
before is les nor yat quhilk is behind, to figurat ye first kirk fra Abel to
Christ, and be ye part yet is behind, larger and richer decorit with ye sign
of ane Cross, to figurat ye Christian pepil. This Chasubil sold be appropriat
with ye Aimict, quhilk was in ye beginning upon his head, to figurate ye
coniunctioun of Christ with his kirk. The au^e alswa sold be correspondant to
ye Chasubil, to figurat Christ to be accommodat to our infirmities. Philo. in
lib. de profug.
Besydis ye foresaidis vestimentis, Philo ye low eikis ye miter, to figurat ye
Royal crown of ye Mesmongers, yat aucht to haif ye head ointi^ with Chrisme,
or consecrate oil to signify ye authority of ye Preistis: ye quhilk ornament
of miter hes been reseruit for ye Preistis only.

Restis now to descend to ye discriptioun of ye partis of ye Mess, of quhilkis
we sal furthschaw particularly ye original, according to ye treuth: first as

ye Mess Priests hes retenit of ye Pompilian Religioun, to conjure ane
sprinkling water, callit halie consecratit water, to sprinkil on yaim yat
standis by at ye Sacrifice. The coniuratiou^ or exorciing institutit be Numa,
was of See or salt water, because said he* yat salt was participa^t of a fiery
nature, or of ye fire, very mete to purify: for yis cause ye ancient Roman
Idolaters, sprinklit with yis salt consecratit water, as with mercurial water,
clensing and purging ye offensis of ye pepil, specially for menswerers and
liers. To preserve yat consecratit and coniurit water, yair war two kindis of
vessels, yat war haliewater fattis: ye ane was great fixit and festenit at ye
entry of yair Kirkis, In ye Buik of ye discourse of ye Religiou^, be John

quhair yai worschippit yair Imagis: to ye end to sprinkil with yt salt water,
yaim yat entrit into ye said Kirkis. The other halie water vessel was tursabil,
to beir yat halie water throch yair Kirkis or housis, to ye end to sprinkil
yaim to yair clensingis and purificatiouns. They yat soulde celebrat ye Mess,

gif it war to ye inferior Gods, it sufficit yat ye Sacrificing Priest
sprinkillit him self with ye halie water: bot gif ye Priest said Mess to ye
Superior Gods, he behuifit to bathe his hail body, and wasche all his members.
It was alswa forbiddin to apply ye halie water or onie other use yan for
expiatiounis and purgatiouns. Following ye quhilk Pompilian institutioun,

Alexander first of yat Name, neirest successor of ye Apostils of Jesus

to chais away Devils. Neueryeles ye better to color ye sorcerie of Pompilius,
he inuentit yis comparisoun: gif it be swa said Alexander, yat ye Ais of ye

to haif taken ye beginning fra Numa Pompilius* mair nor 700. eiris before ye

be ye ancient Roman Idolaters, yat mair nor 260. eiris after ye incarnatioun
of Jesus Christ, Valentinian ye Emperur ag^nis ye halie water sprinklit.
it is reheirsit how ye Emperor Valentinian, entering in ye tempil of ye Gods
fortune, a Priest keeper of ye said tempil, sprinklit him with yis blissit,
halie, and saltit water, quhilk he had taken out of ye haliwater stane, being at
ye entry of ye Tempil, quhairat ye Emperor being commouit, straike ye Priest,
halding his haliwater stick, saying he was rather filit nor clensit. Be yir
true histories, ye Mesmongers may boast yaim selfis, Salt haliwater very an^ik.
ye first part of yair Messel Sacrifice to be very ancient, and yat yair
haliwater stanis, yair saltit haliwaters and clensing, are of ye ancient
doctrine of Numa Pompilius, and not of ye doctrine of ye Euangil of Jesus
Christ, quhilk yai call a new doctrine, and new Testament, for a difference of
ye auld Iowisse ceremonies, and ye Pagaine Idolatries. Bot it I can not
sufficiently meruel, Aganis ye salt water and halie water of Alexander Pape,
of Rome.
quhy Alexander enterprisit to restoire ye Pompilian Idolatry, considering yat
he had ye meanis to restoire ye cerimoniall water, after ye manner of the Iowis,
and in swa doing, rather to follow ye Law of God, yan yat of Numa Pompilius:
for yair was easy meanis to recover aiss, to make a certain haliwater, after
the manner of ye Iowis, ea aiss precious and consecratit: to wit, aiss keipit in
placis quhair ye Relickis lay, cum forth of vailis, buirdclaithis and
consecratit vessellis, yat Bischop Clement Predecessor of Alexander, Cap.

had forbiddin to be applyit to onie profaine use, bot being throch auldnes
consumit to burn yaim in ye fire, and yair aiss to be castin in ye fount. War
not yir aiss consecratit, to steir up Alexander to restoire ye aissie and
haliwater, after ye manner of ye Iowis; gif he had not been swa gredie of salt,
and found a better gust to continue ye ancient Roman Religioun. Their micht
other aiss haif been recouerit be ye successouris of Alexander, Cap. Altaris de

to wit, of round hostis, vnleuenit and consecratit, quhilk ye great Bischop
Hyginus ordenit to be brunt, gif fallin on ye eard, yai could not be lickit up
be ye Mesmonging Priest, and ye aiss of ye said hostis to be laid up in ye
Relick place. In lib. caute. Miss.


Other aiss alswa micht haif been recouerit of rattouns or mise, and other
beastis, having deuorit ye saidis consecratit hostis, ordenit to be bru^t, and
ye aiss laid in ye Relick place. Seeing yan yat Alexander walde not follow ye
cerimoniall Law of God, to institut a blissit salt water, consecratit and
coniurit, quhy hes he not at ye least applyit ye salt with ye host of ye Mess
Preistis, quhilk yai say yai offer to God, as a saving host? In swa doing he
had followit ye cerimonie of Moises, Leuit. 2^.
be ye quhilk it was commandit to offer salt in all Sacrificis, and yair with
to sprinkil ye sacrificis offerit for Saluatioun. Bot gif Alexander and his
successouris had followit ye law of God, yai had inuentit nathing in yair awin
brain: yai had not cause speak of yaim, and left ye memory of yair
institutiouns. For yis occasioun, yai wald not in onie thing follow ye Law of
God: The occasiouns of inu^ting new Idolatri^^.
bot contrariwise haif forbiddin to apply salt with yair round consecratit
hostis, to celebrate yair Messell Sacrificis. They haif alswa forbiddin to mix
aiss in yair haliwaters, to ye end yat in all yair institutiouns it be not
thocht, yat yai haif borowit onie thing of God, nor of ye Law of Moises, and it
far les of ye Evangelical Law of Jesus Christ: bot only thocht to attribute
to yaim self yai inuentiouns, albeit yat yai haif yair Original of the ancient
pagane Roman Idolatry, mair nor 700. eiris, before ye incarnatioun of Jesus
Christ. For resolutioun of yis first part of ye Mess, it war far mair
expedient, (o Mesmongers) yat in place of our sacrificis and coniuratiouns of
saltit water, quhairwith e sprinkill the pepill, e sold schaw forth purelie ye
halie Euangill, The true haliwater for Christiainis.
and cause ye Christian pepil understand that the purificatioun and wasching
of yair sinnis, Heb. ^.
dependis of ye blude of Jesus Christ, quha is michtie aneuche to chaise away
Devils, to draw us aback fra hell, to preserve us fra Eternal death, and to
scraipe away fra us all spot of sin, without using of coniuratiouns and
adiuratiouns, with salt to chaise away the Devils, according to the Pompiliane
Magik, and ye heresy of Samaritainis, Epiph^. lib. 1. tom. 1. sec. 9. and 17.

Bot it was institutit mair yan a thousand eiris before him: quhilk ye ancient
Roman Idolaters callit supplicatioun. The manner was institutit be Numa, to
gain Processioun, or to amease ye wraith of ye Godis, or for to impetrate
peace, or for to pray to God for ye fruitis of ye earth. The ordour was in yis
manner, first before ye Processioun yair marchit oung bairnis, yan ye Preistis,
sacrificers, cled with quhite Surplisis, singing Hymnis, sangis and Canticils,
to ye honor of yair Godis. After did march ye Great Bischop or Curioun, yan
marchit ye Senatouris of Rome, with yair wifis and bairnis, and sum time ye
pepil assistit. In ye Processiou^ yair was commonly borne ye Caise or Relick
place of Jupiter, or of Anubis, be certain Preistis, cled with quhite Surplisis,
ye head schauin, and having ane crown upon yair headis. This crown was swa
reputit, yat euin the Emperor Commodus Antoninus, chief Bischop, causit
schaife him self, and cow his head round, expressitlie to beir ye Caise of ye
God Anubis. Before ye Caise or Relick place, yair marchit ane bering ane wax
candil, halding ane waxin candil lichtit. Quhan ye Processioun marchit throch
ye streitis, yair was dressit resting placis for to serve as statiouns to ye
Preistis, ye caise bearers to draw yair end. Than to ye Processioun, ye Tempils
war opinnit, ye Alters and Imagis perfumit with incense, and ye Relickis of
yair Godis visitit. In ye dayis ordenit to make Processioun, yair was a Feast
celebratit, ye buithis steikit, ye Palaice of justice closit, and ye prisoners
lousit fra yair chainis. Quha can better discriue ye ordour of ye Processiouns,
obseruit until yis day, be ye Mesmongers, instructit fra father to Sone in ye
Pompilian Religioun? Quhat other author could yair be allegit of ye ceremonies

paintit ye portrait of two Drago^is or Serpentis, linkit within vtherafter yair
was drawin ane Agil for ensenzie of ye Roman Empire. Bot Constantine ye great
Emperor, into Grecia causit graif in it a figure of Greik letters, In ye

borne upon a stock, or staff of try giltit in manner of a Cross, ye baner
being four nuikit, in form of ane ensenzie of violet crammosie, syne
brouderit on ye borders with freinzie of gold, or of silver, and precious

Processioun^, in quhilks are borne baners, as gif yai wald ga to weir, or
conduct ane Host of souldartis: bot in place to haif causit paint ye Name of
Jesus Christ: yai haif causit paint Idolis, and Imagis of diverse Gods, and
Goddessis, hic Saintis and sche Saintis, Patronis of every Paroche. This is in
sum, ye beginning of ye Processioun of ye Mess, for ye second part of ye
Mess. Hes yair ever been swa great Idolatry amang ye Israelitis, quhan yai
wald celebrate ye feast of vnleuenit bread, The eir of Christ. 1264
to eat ye Paschal lamb ye figure of ye halie Sacrament of ye Supper, yat ye
mesmongers hes disgisit be yair Messel Sacrificis: causit yai ever bear in
Processiou^ ye flesche, or ye blude of ye immaculat Lamb? Layit yai it ever up
in a Relick house, to be borne in processiou^ throch ye streiti^? As to ye
Serpent of brass, albeit yat yai abusit it, causit yai ever bear it for a
Relick, apo^ ye schoulders of yair Sacrificers, having ye head and beard
schauin, as ye great Bischop Vrbanus hes ordenit to bear in Processioun, ye
round host consecratit be ye Mesmongers? And institutit a Solemn feast upon
thurisday every eir: to ye end to turn ye use of ye halie Sacrament to mair
detestabil Idolatry, nor all his predecessouris did.

After ye haliewater sprinklit, and ye Processioun done, Numa institutit yat ye
Mess Priest sold celebrate the Sacrifice, 3. Part of ye Mess. The Alter and

Are not yir Messalian and Pompilian institutiouns, contraire to ye ancient
cerimoniall Law of ye Iowis, to quhame it was forbiddin to dress yair prayers
toward ye east, for ye unbelief of ye ancient Idolaters. Acknawlege yan (o
Mesmongers) our erectings of Alters toward ye east, our Lampis and lichtit wax

begone of ye ancient Roman Religioun, continewit be ow fra ane to anuther.
For as to ye Imagis and Idolis, quhairwith our Alters are ornit and decorit, to
celebrate our Messel Sacrificis: yai can not take yair beginning fra ye Law of
God, ye quhilk forbiddis not only to permit onie Image in Kirkis, bot not to

Bot to disgise yis Babilonical Sacrifice, ye Messalian Alcoranistis, haif

Jesus Christ, ye auld Roman Idolaters, vsit incens in yair sacrificis: and
alswa ye Romainis haif retenit ye latin term quhilk signifies incens. Thus:
fra ye auld word, (...) yat is to say, I sacrifice: because yat y^ Idolaters
vsit in all yair sacrificis incens, ea alswa had ane incensour tursabil to

celebrating sacrificis to ye Gods Ceres, vsit ye gum of firr, callit Teda in
place of incens: for quhilk cause Ceres is callit be ye Poetis Tedifera.

In ye Alco^an of Titelman, ye incens is interpretit, for ye prayer of ye
M^smonger, because it gais up to heuin, in odor of sweitnes, euin as ye
perfume of ye incens is liftit on hich. He sophisticatis alswa with Biell his
comp^nioun, ye incensour, to signify ye grace of ye halie Gaist. Their subtle

After ye offering, it behuifis us to cume to ye 9. part of ye Mess, ye
richest and delicatest for ye Mesmongers. That is ye host or sacrifice, in
quhilk consistis ye chief point of ye Messall sacrifice. In ye time of the
Magicien Numa, Pollux in ^n^m. lib. 6. Mysteriis peractis, qui sacris

ye Romainis had not it use to slaie and offer up with ye blude of beistis, bot
it was ordenit to eat and communicate within ye Tempil, about ye end of the
Messell sacrifice of litil bread round, consecratit to the honor of Godis, to
quhais Name ye sacrifice was celebratit. Their litil round hostis of fine
flower, war eatin be ye Sacrificer, and be yaim yat stuid by, being upon yair
feit, and not sitting. The flower quhairof yai war maid, was callit Mola, and
fra thence is cume yis term to immolate. Their war syndrie hostis, yat is to
say, litil round breadis, dedicatit to diverse Godis, euin as yair war diverse
Messall sacrificis. with ye said round hostis was offerit wine, ye Alters
serving in stead of tabils. In ye mean time yat ye Sacrificers and yai yat
staid by at ye sacrifice eatit, and communicatit together of ye said litil
round breadis, consecratit to ye honor of yair Go^is, yair war sung Hymnis
and praisis, and be sum ye Organis and Cymbalis soundit.

Before or he deuorit yis round host imprintit with Imagis, ye Messalian
Doctouris haif ordenit ye Priest to use coniuratiouns, and adiuratiouns be
signs of a Cross. First he man make th^e Crossis upon this roun^ host, to
figurat ye three fauld giving of Christ, to wit, be his Father, be Christ him
self, and be ye halie Gaist, in pronuncing yir wordis: Haec dona, haec munera,
haec sancta sacrificia illibata. Sum vthers Alcaranistis and Messalian
Doctouris, interpretis ye third Cross for ye traison of Judas, yat deliuerit
his Master into ye handis of ye Iowis.

Beside ye three foresaidis Crossis, five other followis to figurat ye five day
is of distance fra Palmesonday, unto ye day of his Passioun, or vtherwise to
represent ye sieve woundis of Christ, two in ye handis, two in ye feit, and in
ye richt side ane. Of ye quhilkis five Crossis, ye three first sold be maid
upon ye Chalice, and ye round Host, to figurat ye delivering of Christ to ye
Preistis, to ye Scribis, and to ye Phariseans, or for to figurat ye price of ye
selling of Christ: to wit, three tymis ten, quhilk are worth threttie pennies.
The two other Crossis are maid separatlie, ye ane quhilkis ye fourt upon ye
Host, and ye other upon ye Chalice, and are done syndrie to play two
personagis, of Christ and of Judas That being done ye Mesmonging Priest in
continewing to play ye fule, and his mumchancis, spreadis out his armis, to
figurat Christ Jesus, extendit on ye Cross. Than he liftis on ^ich his round
Host, imprintit with Imagis to cause worschip it. After he begins again to
m^ke three Crossis, ane upon ye Host, ye other upon ye Chalice, ye third upon
himself, to play ye personage of three estains, of yaim yat are in heuin, in
purgatory and on ye eard. He duntis afterward upon his breist, to play ye
personage of ye theif hangit upon ye Cross yat repentit. Bot ye knocking on ye
brei^t sold be done with three hindmest fingers of ye hand, because ye thumb
and ye formest finger are reseruit to consecrate and transubstantiat ye round
Host. Mairouer he man strike on his breist three tymis, to figurate ye
threfauld offense of y^ heart, of ye mouth, and of ye deid: in lifting up his
voice, to represent ye theif or ye Centurion, yat confessit God in his
passioun: s^x other Crossis are afterward reiteratit, three upon ye couerit
Chalice, to represent ye three hou^is yat Christ was hung in yis life. And ye
three other Crossis are maid upon ye discouerit Chalice and round Host being
again lift^it up, to figurate yet three houris yat Christ was hung on ye Cross
dead: than are addit two other Crossis, after yat ye Mesmonger hes kissit ye
Chalice, to figurate ye m^sterie of blude and water, sprung out of ye side of
Christ. Besi^is ye foresaidis dume m^mchancis, ye Priest sold lift ye Vaill
fra above ye Ch^lice, and cover it again with ye Pa^, to represent ye Vaill
brokin in ye midis, at ye death of Christ. That being done, ye round Host is
laid down fra abuif ye Ch^lice, and laid upon ye corporal, to figurate ye
burial of Christ. The mesmonger having played ye personage of ye hangit theif,
of ye traitor Judas, of Christ and of ye Publicans, h^ playis afterward ye
personage of ye Centurioun, in singing ye Pater noster. Bot ye Alc^ran of
Duran^us interpretis he ye vij. petitiouns of ye Pater Noster, ye vij. tearis
of ye Virgin Marie, or ye vij. vertewis, or ye vij gif^is of ye halie gaist, or
ye vij. bl^ssingis, or ye vij mortal sinnis. This s^ng being endit, ye
Mesmonger taries a litil quhile in silence, to figurate ye silence or rest of
Christ in ye graif. Anuther api^ murgioun or mumchance is play^t be ye

This is not a sufficient excuse to confirm our Idolatries, to allege ye lang

Quha hes instructit ow (o Mesmongers) to haif corruptit ye halie sacrament of
ye Supper of Jesus Christ, in resauing litil round breadis, and round Hostis,

with his Apostils, ordenit he yaim to haif litil breadis and round Hostis, to
cause print in yaim ye licknes and schapis of men, to adjure and conjure yaim
with Crossis and Crossingis in number, euin or od, and to cause worschip yaim?
Acknawlege yan (o Mesmongers) our principal part of ye Mess, to wit, our
litil round Hostis, to haif taken yair original fra the ancient Pompilian
Religioun, mair nor 700. eiris before ye incarnatioun of Jesus Christ, quha he^
not ordenit to ow yis roundnes of Hostis, nor yat yai sold be rather round nor

chuisit a round figure, after ye manner of Numa, yat contrariwise yan quhan he
institutit ye halie sacrament of ye communion of his body, he vsit breaking of

and figure, signifiing reallie and sacramentallie his body, be ye vertew of
the halie Gaist. And not only ye Mesmongers haif electit a round form in
yair litil consecratit Hostis, imprintit with Imagis, for to cause worschip
ya^m after ye manner of ye auld Romainis: bot besid yai haif excedit all
Idolaters. For in ye time of Numa Pompilius and his successouris, yai yat stuid
by at ye Messell sacrifice, eatit together on yair feit, of ye said litil round
consecratit Hostis: bot s^nsyne ye Mess Preistis haif reseruit for yaim alane
ye communion of ye litil round consecratit Hostis, without using of charity
towardis yaim yat stand by at yair Messell sacrificis. Is ye ordinance of
Christ follow it, yat brake ye bread and distributit it to his Apostils? Jesus
Christ ye eternal Priest was he only, beside ane Alter eating ane litil

And besidis, for mair extreme Idolatry, ye Messalian Doctouris interprours,

sinnis: and ye thride steipitin wine, for yaim yat are in yis eard living. Bot
ye Alcoran of Durand, reheirsis ye three partis of ye brokin Host, to represent
ye threfauld body of Christ: in ye grave sleping, in ye eard lying, and yan
rissin again. The other subtle Doctor Biell, not to confess ye body of
Christ, to be brissit or brokin in ye round Host, he sayis subtillie ye
breking of ye Host, to be maid of ye accident without substance. Are not yir
horribill heresies to cause communicate ye sauli^ being in heuin or in
purgatory institutie be Sergius, Doctor of Mahomet, be ye meanis of ane round
Host deuourit be ye Mess Priest.

Bot e may (o Mesmongers object to me ye use of ye primitive Kirk, obseruit in
ye communion of the halie Supper, quhair every ane of ye assembly in ye Kirk
tuik a portioun of brokin bread and consecratit, to communicate and eat
together, ye quhilk use hes been retenit unto yis day in our Messell
sacrificis, celebratit on Sunday, quhan e cause distribute pecis of halibread
to yaim yat standis by within ye Kirk. Bot yis auld communioun is remanit in a
figure only: because yat ye Mesmongers abusing ye halie Sacramentis,
Communion of halibread
haif reseruit for yaim alane ye litil round host consecratit, to devour it
without distributing of onie portioun yairof to yaim yat standis by, Ane
notabil difference between ye round consecr^tit Hostis and h^li^read
quhamto yai laife pecis of halibread yat are four nuikit for ye may part.
The round host is vnleuenit, and ye halibread leuenit: ye round host is
without salt, and ye halibread saltit, ye round host is imprintit with Imagis,
and ye halibread without form or schap, ye round host is worschippit, and ye
halibread resauit with thankisgeuing, ye round host is deuourit be ye Priest,
and ye halibread distributit to every ane of ye assembly, to communicate and
eat yairof: ye round host is in a part steipit in wine, and ye halibread is
eatin dry without wine. Breistie yair is swa great difference between yir two
kindis of communion, as yair is between ye Law of ye auld Idolatry, and ye
Evangelical Law: reserving yis yat yai aggre in ane point, yat is both the
ane and the other are a corruptioun of ye halie Sacrament of ye Supper, ordenit
of God.

Restis to descend to ye deipt of ye labirinth of Idolatry. We haif reheirsit
ye story of ye pepil of Israel, yat contentit not yaim self of ye heavenly

of ye flesche of ye beastis, in yair sacrificis, specially ye scheip, ye sow,

the wine being na mair wine, bot ane accident without substance* was yair ever
mair abhominabil Magik, and mair detestabil heresy, yan yis Messalian

lothit with eating of MANNA, and heavenly bread, requiring flesche, ye MANNA
was it transubstanciatit in flesche, in bane, and into blude? Quhan ye ancient
Roman Idolaters, walde haif changit yair round hostis of flower, and askit to
eat flesche in yair sacrificis, vsit yai yis Magik of transubstanciatioun? The
eir of Christ 1062. In Chronol. Joan. funcii.
Qhairfore I will confess frelie, yis Messell eik to haif been newlingis
institutit, be Mesmongers mair nor a thousand eir, after ye incarnatiou^ of
Jesus Christ. This heresy begoud gretlie to be spread, in ye time of ane

Deane of Saint Maurice of Angers. Aganis ye quhilk abhominabil Magik and
heresy, it behuifis summarlie, be manner of recapitulatioun, to confer ye
institutiouns of ye Sacramentis, ordenit of God. First ye fruitis of knawlege
of good and ill, forbiddin to the first father Adam, as halie signs and
Sacramentis of feir, and obedience, quhairof dependit life, and death: war yai
transubstantiatit and turnit in knawlege, or into death? to laife yair nature
of tries, and fruitis, reducit in ane accident without substance: ye celestial
MANNA, and rock flowing with lively water, Heavenly Manna Rock flowing of water
being Sacramentis comparit to ye halie Sacrament of ye Supper, war yai
transubstantiatit to ane accident without substance? The Lambs without spot
offerit up be Abel in ye sacrifice acceptabil to God, Lambis offerit be Abell.
war yai transubsta^tiatit in onie other nature? The litil skinn circumcisit,
Circumcision
for a note and mark of ye conuena^t, to ye good Patriarche Abraham, and to his
posterity, was it turnit in ane accide^t without substance? The blude of ye
Paschal Lamb, for assurance of ye saluatioun of Israel, Paschal La^b
was it turnit in anuther substance? The flesche of ye immaculat Lamb, ordenit
to be eatin on ye day of ye Passover, ye true figure of ye halie Sacrament of
ye Supper, was it transubstantiatit in ane accident without substance? Serpent
of B^asse.
The Serpent of brass, be ye only behalding quhairof was geuin health to ye
seik, left it of to be a Serpent of brass? was it transubstantiatit, in yat it
was ordenit for a Sacrament, and halie sign to ye pepil of Israel? The beastis
offerit in sacrificis, Beastis offerit up.
alsweil of eardlie beastis, as of vnleuenit bread, and other halie signs,
ordenit of God, for Sacramentis, and halie figuris, for ye clensing and
saluatioun of ye pepil of Israel, war yai transubstanciatit in accidentis
without substance? All ye signs consecratit, and ordenit of God, in ye Kirk of
Israel, albeit yat yai had reallie, and sacrame^tallie, representit yat quhilk
was figurit be yaim, and war not as ane simpil picture, or without effect, it
yair was never swa horribil ane heretic, yat hes inuentit yis Magik of
tansubstanciatiou^. Neueryeles it behuifis (o Mesmongers) yat e acknawlege, yat
ye good and halie fathers of Israel, hes been adoptit, impit, and regeneratit
be faith in Jesus Christ, begottin before all warldis: yat yai haif been
narissit, and purchasit life eternal be Jesus Christ: Conference of ye Faith of
ye auld fathers of Israel with ours
yat yai and we haif bot ane only God, and ane only Jesus Christ, our
Mediator, and redemer: yat yai be faith communicatit, and sacramentallie and
participatit spirituallie, in ye blude of Jesus Christ, for yair saluatioun,
and life eternal. That yair is na difference as tuiching God, between yaim
having precedit Jesus Christis incarnatioun, and us quha are sen his

do celebrate ye memory and remembrance, of ye sacrifice already endit be
Jesus Christ, having fruitioun of ye promis accomplissit. Gif yan ye Israelits
haif eatin ye same heavenly bread, and dronkin ye same hailsume drink, yat we
haif be faith, in ane only Jesus Christ: gif yai had halie signs, 1. Cor.
10. Aug. in psalm.
to represent actuallie and reallie, ye death of Jesus Christ to cume, euin as
we haif had ye halie signs of his death, present, or passit: yai for ye time
to cume, we for ye time passit, quhy is it yat ye Mesmongers haif inuentit yis
new Magik, to turn a halie sacrament ordenit of God into ane Magik of
transubstanciatioun, and into ane accident without substance? Aganis ye
miracils all git be ye Mesmo^gers. Exodus 7. and 8 Exodus 14.
Gif God to approve his micht, and manifest the hardness, and obstinacy of
Pharo, thocht good to do wondrous thingis, be Moises and Aaron, in turning ane
wand into ane Serpent, ye water of ye flude into blude, and into Padockis, or
froggis: ye dust of ye eard into life, after alswa to make ye reid sailabil
see, dry, and did money vthers meruels, is yat to infer ane
transubstanciatioun, of litil round Hostis vnleuenit, imprintit with Imagis,
into ane accident without substance? In quhat place of ye halie Scripture,
quhan yair is mentioun maid of ye halie signs, and sacramentis, or sacrificis
ordenit of God, is it said, ye sign or Sacrament, to be transubstanciatit? Bot
contrariwise, ye will of God, willing to acco^modat ye self, to ye infirmity of
man, hes ordenit to him fra time to time, common signs, for notis and markis
of ye assurance of ye thing signifiit. Quhairin ye power of God is mair
furthschawin and manifestit, to give us yat quhilk be ye halie sign is
representit, be ye vertew of Faith, and of ye halie Spirit, yan gif ye sign
it self war reallie tra^substanciatit, be sum miracil seen to ye eye. For ye
sacramentis comprehendis in yaim thingis mair spiritual nor carnal: for yis
cause, God be his Prophetis hes ever blamit his pepill of Israel, for taking
ye sacramentis over carnally, as we haif before summarlie reheirsit.

Bot tell me (o Mesmo^gers) quhan Jesus Christ thocht good to interpret,
Interpretatioun be Jesus Christ of ye communion of his body.
yat he was ye true bread of life, discendit fra heuin, to give life eternal,
and how it behuifit to understand yir Sacramental wordis, to eat his flesche,
and drink his blude, quhairthrowye Caphernitis owr predecessouris war
sclanderit, hes he taucht be his interpretioun, yat to eat his flesche, sold
be understand be ane litil round Host transubstanciatit? The round Host of
flour, and ye wine to be na mair bread nor wine, bot accidentis without
substance. Is it ye doctrine of Christ our abhominabill Magik? Nathing les,
Ioh. 6.
bot Jesus Christ as ane true Lawgiuer (to quhame only belangis to interpret
his Law) answerit unto ye Caphernite Doctors, yat yai war over gross, and
carnal, yat restit yaim self in ye flesche, as e (o Mesmongers) albeit yat ye
flesche alane profitis nathing, seeing, yat his sacramental wordis, war
spiritual, ye flesche sayis he profitis nathing, Ioh. ^.
bot ye Spirit quickins. And alswa how can e (o Mesmongers) halilie accord our
transubstanciatioun, with ye doctrine of Jesus Christ, yat promisis and
assuris, to gif life eternal to yaim yat sall eat his flesche, and drink his
blude, gif e take yir wordis carnally? For e can not be ignorant yat our
body, albeit yat it haif deuourit our round Hostis, transubstanciatit in
flesche and into blude, suppit and lickit ye wine transubstanciatit into blude,
neueryeles it dyis, and is mortal be ye necessity of ye Law. Quhairfore ye
life eternal, promisit be yis communion, can not be understand of ye body nor
of ye mortal flesche. It behuifis yan necessarily, yat e acknawlege for ane
halie interpretatioun, yat to eat ye body, and drink ye blude of Jesus Christ,
sold be referrit to ye life spiritual, and celestial, and yat ye flesche
profitis nathing, bot ye spiritual wordis, and ye communion of ye body, and
blude of Jesus Christ, be faith and in ye Spirit giving life eternal. This
interpretatioun is reheirsit, be ye halie Apostil John money tymis, quhan Jesus
Christ vsit yir tearmis, he yat cumis to me sall never haif hunger, Ioh. ^.
he that hes faith in me sall never be thristie, bot sall haif eternal life.
Are not yir tearmis understand abill aneuch, to interpret yis halie Sacrament
of ye communion, of ye body and blude of Jesus Christ, without having recours
unto our Magik of transubstanciatioun?

Anuther like interpretatioun, of ye halie Doctor and Author of ye law of ye
sacramentis is discriuit, quhan Jesus Christ was askit of Nicodemus, Conference
of Baptism with ye sacrament of ye Supper. Ioh. 3.
of ye meanis how a man sold be regeneratit and borne again. Is it possibil,
said Nicodemus, yat a man can return again to his mothers wambe? To yis
questioun Jesus Christ hes he answerit, yat in ye halie sacrament of Baptism,
ye water is turnit into ye body, into flesche, and into blude, and
transubstanciatit into a carnal wambe, be it for to be borne again and
regeneratit? was yair not as great ressone, according to our Magik, to use yis
answer in it, as in ye Sacrament of ye Supper? For be ye ane of ye two halie
Sacramentis, we are regeneratit, and be ye other we are nurissit. Bot
regeneratioun is marvelous to ye wisdom of man, alsweil as ye nurisment: for
according to ye human and carnal iugment, it walde appeir to be vnpossibil
to be borne twice, bot our good God hes vsit ye like interpretatioun, for ye
regeneratioun, as for ye communion of his flesche and of his blude, to wit, yat
it behuifis to understand yir sacramental tearmis spirituallie, and not
carnally: for ye flesche profitis not, bot ye Spirit quickins. That quhilk is
of ye flesche, is fleschlie, yat quhilk is of ye Spirit, Ioh. 3.
is spiritual.

The halie Apostil in giving to ye Corinthians, that quhilk he had resaisit of
ye hand of God, admonissit yaim of ye second cumming of Jesus Christ, 1. Cor.
11.
quha co^mandis in ye mean time, to communicate with ye body, and blude of
Jesus Christ, be ye breaking of bread, and cup of benedictioun, callit ye new
Testament, and new conuena^t, contractit be ye blude of Jesus Christ. Seeing yan
yat we are assurit of ye second cumming of Jesus Christ, being gave up to
heuin, sitting at ye richt hand of God his Father, unto ye day predestinat, yat
he sold cume again to judge ye quick and ye dead, how sall e aggre yis place
(o Mesmongers) quhan be our Magik, e say, e cause daily cume down, and causis
cume again ye body of Jesus Christ in flesche and in bane, before ye time
preordinat be cume of his second cumming? Tit. liui. lib. 1. Decad. ^. Numa
Po^pilius, vt populum Romanum sac^is obligaret, vol^bat videri sibi cum dea
Aegeria congressus esse nocturnos, eiusque moni tu se, quae accepta diis
immortalibus sacraforent, instituere. Valor. Max. lib. 1. cap. 3.
This Magik hes be ow been restorit fra owr first Author of the Messel
sacrifice, Numa Pompilius: yat be his Magik gaif to understand yat he causit
cume down fra heuin his Nymphe and Gods Aegeria, ea and alswa his Jupiter
Elicius, be ye meanis of quhame war reuelit to him the mysteries and secreitis
of heuin. Gif be owr Magik, ye round host consecratit, was transubstantiatit
in ye true, and real body of Jesus Christ, ye bread being na mair bread, bot
ye true body, how haif e taken yis bauldnes to brisse and break in pecis ye
body of Jesus Christ, according to ye inuentioun of Sergius, second of yat
Name, our predecessor Bischop of Rome? Are e not far mair detestabil hangme^,
nor owr predecessouris, ye lieutena^ts of ye Kirk of Rome, yat crucifiit Jesus
Christ, Ioh. ^9. Exodus 12. Nomb. 9.
neueryeles without onie brissing or breking in pecis his body, as it had been
propheciit? And it e haif not contentit owr selfis to haif brissit him, in three
pecis, bot in our Messel sacrificis, Corruptiou^ of ye halie Sacrament.
haif enterprisit to drown or steip a portioun in ye wine, transubstantiatit
into blude to devour it.

To confirm owr Magik of transubstanciatioun, quhy haif e not put ordour, to
preserve fra corruptioun, owr litil round hostis, imprintit, yat e keip, Aganis
transubsta^tiaciou^
and layis up in stoire, swa diligently in Occrestis, and Relick placis: after
yat yai haif been transubstanciatit, in flesche and bane, and in ye real body
of Jesus Christ? is it not a detestabil heresy, to belief yat ye body of
Jesus Christ, resaifis corruptioun, ea and oftentymis is eatin of wormis,
mytis, rattouns, and mise? Can e interpret, yat it is ane accide^t without
substance, seeing yat ye hostis becume oftymis stinking, and corruptit, within
our Occrestis? Oftymis alswa deuourit be eardlie and brutall beastis, yat e
cause burn, and lay up yair aiss in Relick placis? Quhan the Roman Bischop
victor, third of yat Name, resaifit poisone be owr transubstanciatit wine into
blude, Herman. ^o^.
was it ane accident without substance? Or quhan ye Emperor Henry, Blond.
Plat.
seuint of yat Name, was wurriit in eating a litil round Host, consecratit and
transubstanciatit, was it without substance, considering it gaif occasiou^ of
death? Their is far greter apperance, in ye MANNA celestial, geuin to ye
pepill of Israel, ye quhilk althoch yat it become corruptit, gif it was keipit,
it is it, yat yat quhik was laid up, in ye secreit place of ye Ark of conuenat
of ye Lord, N^em. 9. Psa^l 78.105. Sap. 16. Ioh. 6.
was conseruit without onie corruptiou^: was it yair fore transubstanciatit in
flesche, and bane, to be callit ye celestial bread, ye bread cum down fra
heuin, ye bread of life, and ye bread of Angels?

Now it restis to refute ye subtle ressouns of ye Mesmongers, yat for all ye
fundatioun of yair Magik, restit yaim self carnally, Interpretatioun of ye
sacramental wordie.
in ye term of Est, saying yir wordis, to be writtin express, yis is my
body, yis is my blude, quhan Jesus Christ institutit ye halie Sacrament of the
communion of his body, and of his blude, under ye figuris of bread and wine.
Bot I pray all yat are Zealous of ye honor of God, to consider exactlie ye
halie institutiou^ of yis Sacrament, be ye quhilk God hes thocht good to
represent, and signify ye communion of his body, be ye bread, and ye drinking
of his blude, be ye wine and cup. All will confess, yat ye true and principal
nurisment of ye body of man, is comprehendit under ye kindis of bread and of
wine, swa yat ye term of bread, is often taken in ye halie Scripture for ye
nurisment and life of man. Let us begin to pass throch ye placis of the Bibil.
To ye first man, creatit to ye Image of God, for vengance of his sin, Genesis 3.
was it not forespokin unto him, yt he sold eat his bread, in ye sweat of his
body? Is their onie man swa ignorant, Genesis 28.
yat will not confess ye bread, to be understand for ye living and life of
man? Quhan Jacob maid his prayer to God, to gif him his bread and clais,
understood he not be ye bread, all yat quhilk was necessary for his nurisment?
Exodus 16.
Quha^ it is reheirsit yat God causit rain bread upon ye pepill of Israel,
being in the desertis, and yat of yis heavenly bread, N^em. 9. Psalm. 78. Sap.
16. Ioh. 6. Genesis 14.
ye Israelits war satisfiit, yis term of bread, is it not understand, for ye
celestial MANNA, send of God to nurisse ye pepil of Israel? This MANNA is it
not callit ye bread fra heuin, and ye bread of Angels, geuin to ye pepill
without travel? Quhan Melchisedech thocht good to help ye company of
Soldartis, of ye good Father Abraham, presentit he yaim not bread and wine?
Genesis 18.
Quhan Abraham thocht good, to gratify, and refresche, ye three Angels, yat
apperit to him, gaif he yaim not bread bakin in ye aiss? Genesis 21.
Gaif he not to Agar bread for her fude? The mother of Isaak, to schaw her
favor to her best belouit Sone, Genesis 27.
gaif him bread Joseph in Egypt offerit bread to his brethrin for yair fude.
Quhan a man will discriue a famine, Genesis 43.
or scantnes of victualis, is it not said, yair wantis bread? Genesis 47. Number. 21.
Quhan it plesit God, to promis sum favor, to ye pepil keeping his
comma^dementis, gaif he yaim not assurance of bread in abundance? Leuit. 26.
Quhan he recommendit ye pure as his members, hes he not commandit, to gif yaim
bread. Tob. 4.
It is yan bread yat nurissis and enterteinis ye hairt and ye life of man.
Quhan Satan enterprisit to tempt Jesus Christ, Psalm. 104.
to make it manifest to us yat he was true man, chusit he not bread, to steir
him up, to turn ye stanis into bread. Mat. 4. Luc. 4.


Quhan it plesit Jesus Christ, to celebrat his bankets, to gif fude, ye ane
time, to five thousand men, Ioh. 6. Mat. 14. Luc. 5. Mat. 15.
ye other time to four thousand personis, did he not schaw forth his micht,
upon ye element of bread? Quhan he taucht us to dress our prayer to God,
ordenit he not in his Dominicall oraison to pray God to gif us our daily
bread. Mat. 6. Luc. 1^.
And not only in the halie Bibill is mentioun maid of bread, for ye bodelie
and common fude, bot alswa in ye sacrificis, celebratit be ye sacrificers of ye
Hebrewis, Exodus 12.
yair is a Law prescriuit of ye halie bread, ordenit of God, to wit, Azymall
bread without leven, Leuit. 24 Mat. 11. 1. Reg 21.
Other breadis war callit ye schew bread, quhilk ye Sacrificers every ouke
renewit, and eatit, quhairof vsit David, being presentit to him be Abimelech ye
hie Priest.

Be ye contrary, ye term of bread is accommodat to ye bread of iniquity,
Prove. 20.13 Esaias. 30. Ezech. 4. Malach. 1. Psalm. 2^. Ezech. 12. Oze. 7.
to ye bread of lying, to ye bread of anguisse, to ye unclean bread of
Idolaters, to ye pollutit bread offerit upon ye Alter, to ye bread of tearis,
and to ye bread of trembling, ye Ephraimitis alswa are callit aissie bread, not
turnit, yat is to say, on ye ane side bakin, and on ye other not, circumcisit,
and Idolaters.

Be yir meanis, it behuifis not (o e Mesmongers Caphernitis) yat e be swa
hardnit, and growin auld in our carnalitie, yat e take na head, to ye Phrasis
of ye halie Scripture, in ye quhiks ye term of bread is sumtyme taken for
eardlie, Deuteronomy. 8. Mat. 4. Luke 4.
and corporal bread, as quhan it is said, yat man liuis not only of bread,
bot alswa of all, yat procedis out of ye mouth of God. Sumtymis alswa bread is
taken for ye word of God, and for doctrine: quhan Jesus Christ commandit his
Discipils, Mat. 15.
to take tent yat yai eatit not of ye bread, with ye leven of ye Pharisees, yir
tearmis of bread and leven, are yai not interpretit for ye doctrine of ye
Pharisees, Mat. 15. Mar. 7.
heretikis? Quhan ye woman of Canaan, askit grace and mercy for ye health of
her douchter, haldin in infirmity of seiknes, Jesus Christ answerit he not,
yat it was not lawful, to cast out ye bread of ye Childrin to gif it unto
Dogs. In yis answer, bread is it not taken, for ye life, and for ye health, and
not allanerlie for the corporal fude?

Seeing yan yat bread is taken for ye life of man, ye quhilk dependis
principally of bread and wine, and yat ye gudnes of God, willing to accommodat
ye self to our infirmity, thocht good to choose ye two signs, figuris, or
markis notabil, to signify his body and his blude, to wit, ye bread and ye
wine, yir two kindis of fude being as it war common to all natiouns, is yis ane
occasioun, to haif imaginit a transubstanciatiou^ fleschlie, as gif without it,
God war not potent aneuch, to figurat unto us, and represent reallie and
sacramentallie, life to be geuin unto us, ea eternal, be ye communion of ye
consecratit bread, and wine of blissing, figuris and signs of his body and of
his blude.

Jesus Christ hes pronuncit yir wordis, yat ye bread is his body, and ye wine
his blude: he hes alswa said, yat he is ye lively bread, ye bread of life, and
ye bread giving life, quhilk is cum down fra heuin. He sayis alswa, Mat. 6.
Mar. 14. Ioh. 6.
yat he quha eatis of yat bread, he fall live eternally. Is it to infer be yis
word, Est, that Jesus Christ is turnit and tra^substanciatit into bread, and
yat he is na mair Christ, bot ane accident without substance? Oh detestabil
heresy. Haif e (o Mesmongers) greter ressone, to interpret carnally yir
wordis, yis is my body, to transubstanciat ye bread into his body, nor quhan
he manifestis, yat he is ye bread, to transubstanciat him into bread, seeing yat
it is writtin yat ye communion of yis bread gifis life eternal? Jesus Christ
sayis, hoc est corpus me^m: Ioh. 6. Mat. 26. Ioh. 6.
he sayis alswa of him self, hic est panis qui de caelo descendit In both ye
two placis yis word, Est, is it not yairto apply it? Behuifis it yairfore to
infer a Magik of transubstanciatioun, in place to interpret hailsumlie, be ane
Metonymie, and familiar comparisoun of the bread to Jesus Christ, to cause us
understand, be him to be geuin unto us life eternal, and be him to be geuin to
us spiritual fude, euin as be ye bread corporal fude.

How ever it be, it behuifis it ay to haif recours, to ye true interpretatioun
of Jesus Christ, ye true Lawgiuer and author of yis halie sacrament, yat
exponing his institutioun, sayis first of all, yat he is ye bread of life, yan
after he sayis, yat yis bread is his flesche, and his body, Ioh. 6.
yat sold be geuin for ye saluatioun of ye warlde. He sayis yat his flesche,
is ye true meat, and his blude ye true drink: he sayis quha eatis his flesche,
and drinkis his blude rem^inis in him: how is it yat he interpretis yis eating?
Ioh. 6.
Jesus Christ interpretis him self be yir wordis. He yat cumis to me sall never
haif hunger, he yat will belief in me sall never haif thrist. Is not yis ye true
eating, and ye true drinking, never to haif hunger, and never to haif Christ?
Is it neidfull for ye having of faith, yat consistis in ye Spirit, is it
neidsull for ye addressing of our self to Jesus Christ, our heavenly bread, our
spiritual drink, to satisfy us for ever, to stanche perpetually our thrist
of sin, to rin to ane Magik of transubstanciatiou^, and forge and invent ane
accident without substance? Quhairfore (o Mesmongers) haif e enterprisit, to
invent anuther interpretatioun, yan yat of Jesus Christ, quha testifies the
flesche, not to profit, bot ye Spirit to quickin: and that yir wordis are not
carnal, bot spiritual, giving Spirit and life, be faith and assurance, yat he
is ye Saluiour of the world incarnat, dead, and crucifiit, to gif us eternal
life, yan after rissin again, gain up to heuin, sitting at ye richt hand of
God his Father, abiding eternal Priest, propitiatour, Mediator, and Redemer.

Let us return to yis term Est, yat cummers and troubils ye harnis of ye
Mesmongers, to imagine a transubstanciatioun. Gif Jesus Christ hes pronuncit,
yat he is the true wine try, yat God his Father is ye housband man, and yat we
are ye branchis, Ioh. 15.
is yat to infer, be yis term Est, ane Magik of tra^substa^ciatioun of God
into ane husband man of Jesus Christ into ane wine try, Ioh. 4.
and of us into branchis? Ioh. 10.
Gif Jesus Christ is callit ye immaculat Lamb, yat takis away ye sinnis of ye
world, is yat to establisse or induce a transubstanciatioun? Gif Jesus Christ
hes said yat he is ye dure of ye scheip faulde, be ye quhilk it behuifis to
enter, to be in saifgaird: and yat he is ye good scheipheard, and we are his
scheip, is yat to astrict to yis, yir placis of ye halie Scripture, yat it is
necessary, because yis term Est, is yairto applyit, to belief a
transubstanciatioun? Quhan Jesus Christ admonissit his Apostils, saying unto
yaim, Mat. 5.
yat yai are salt of ye eard, did he transubstanciat or turn yaim into pillars
of salt, Genesis 19.
as ye wife of Loath? Gif Jesus Christ hes said be his Apostils, yat we are ye
Tempil of God, quhairin ye halie Gaist dwellis, is it to Imagine, yat we are
tra^substa^ciatit in a heap of stanis? 1. Cor. 3. 2. Cor. 6.
Gif ye halie Apostil hes writtin yat Jesus Christ is ye rok, of ye quhilk
procedis ye lively water, 1 Cor. 10.
to wasche and purge us fra our sinnis, is it to imagine a subtle
transmutatioun, and transubstanciatiou^ of Jesus Christ into a rok, or material
craig? Gif ye halie Apostil testifies, yat we are ye body of Jesus Christ, is
it to infer, 1. Cor. 12.
yat we are vanissit away, and are na mair men, bot transubstanciatit into ane
accident without substance? I forese weil (o Mesmongers indurit) yat e will
object, all yir placis before allegit, in ye quhilk yis term, Est, is found,
not to make mentioun of ye sacramentis, quhilk are far mair exactlie to be
obseruit, forsamekil as yai are halie mysteries, ordenit of God: ye quhilk is
true. And alswa not only yis word, Est, is found in ye halie Scripturis heir
before declarit: bot quhan it is spokin of ye halie sacramentis, first ordenit
of God, to his pepil of Israel, is it not writtin yat circumcisioun is ye
co^uenant, and contract of God? Genesis 17.
In ye other sacrament of ye communion of ye Paschal Lamb, is it not said yat
ye Lamb is ye Passover, yat is to say a passing by? Exodus 12.13.
Is it to infer a Magik of transubstanciatioun? will e not confess (o
Mesmonging transubstanciatouris) yat in yir placis of yehalie Scripture,
speaking of ye halie sacrame^tis, yis term (Est) can not be other wise
interpre^it, bot to signify: and yat ye circumcisioun was ye sign and mark
of ye conuenant and confederacy contractit be God with Abraham: Genesis 17.
the Paschall Lamb was alswa the halie sign of the Passover, for remembrance
of the deliverance fra Egypt? The Ark of conuenant for anuther Sacrament, of ye
quhilk it is writtin, Nomb. 10. Psalm. 68.94. Math. 21. Ioh. 2.
that it is ye verity and power of the Lord, is it to say, that it was
transubstanciatit into the majesty of God? It behuifis, it behuifis with
discretiou^ to interpret ye halie Scripture, and in humility, without
sophistry, and without Magik, to understand hailsumlie ye true interpretatioun
of the tearmis and not abide swa gretlie in ye letter, ye quhilk slais, bot to
resaif ye word of God in ye Spirit, yat quickins. Gif yan ye Ark consecratit is
namit ye Lord, and callit God, because yat in it, he exercisit his power, and
declarit his Oracils, and mysteries to draw, be ane outward sign, ye pepill of
Israel, to remember yaim self of God, to feir him and obey him: gif Jesus
Christ hes alswa said yat he is ye bread cume down fra heuin, ye bread yat
quickins, yat ye bread brokin is his body, that the wine is his blude, yat ye
cup is ye new Testament: be ye outward signs of bread and of wine, to cause us
understand our life, and fude of saluatioun, to depend of ane only Jesus
Christ, and yat be his death and blude sched, we haif assurance of eternal
life, euin as ye bread and ye wine are for ye bodelie nurisment: and yat it was
his will, and he ordenit yir halie signs to serve us as sacramentis, for
approbatioun and confirmatioun of our faith, is yis ane occasioun, to haif
playit ye Caphernitis or Nicodemits, for to inquire or dout of ye power of God,
how is it possibill to eat ye body and drink ye blude of Jesus Christ, how is
it possibil to be regenerat and borne again? Seeing yt ye promis be ye word, hes
been gifin to us, quhy haif e (o Mesmongers) imaginit ane carnal
transubstantiacioun, mistraisting ye vnco^prehensibil power of God? sold it
not haif suffisit ow, to belief simply ye body, and ye blude of Jesus Christ,
to be reallie and sacramentallie offerit unto us, to communicate of it for our
fude, and for to gif us life eternal, be ye bread and ye wine consecratit,
with giving of thankis, ye bread being trewlie his body, and ye wine his
blude, quhilk it behuifis to resaif worthelie be faith, and in purity of
conscience, as halie signs and markis of ye heavenly bage, without inquiring
over subtillie of ye meanis, vthers yan ye interpretatiou^ of Jesus Christ, yat
ye flesche profitis not, bot ye Spirit quickins, and yat his wordis are Spirit
and life? Sold we doubt, yat God hes not ye power, be ye signs of bread and
of wine, consecratit, to make us communicate with ye body and blude of Jesus
Christ, albeit yat ye bread abidis still bread, and ye wine, remanis wine? Gif
it war not a sacrament bot sold be callit ane miracil: as quhan Jesus Christ
turnit ye water into wine, he vsit yen a miracil of transubstantiacioun,
changing ye water into wine. Io^. ^.
Bot he ordenit not yairof a sacrament, as he did of ye communion of his body
and blude, be ye halie figuris of bread and wine* was it not as easy to God to
cause change ye wine into blude, or ye bread into flesche, as to moises and
Aaron, to change ye water of ye river into blude, Exodus 4.7.8
to prove ye hardness of Pharo: or quhan ye cludis war turnit into ye flesche of
Quaillis, Exodus 16.
yat ranit down upon ye pepil of Israel? Neueryeles God hes not ordenit yir
miracils, to serve as ordinare sacramentis: bot wald accommodat him self, to
our infirmity, in giving us halie signs, not transubstanciatit, yat are not
vain or fantastik: bot are outward signs, yat we may se, tuiche, eat, and
taist, abiding in yair substance, and neueryeles representis sacramentallie,
yat quhilk is comprehendit, and signifiit be yaim, quhairin consistis our
approbatioun of faith, to schaw forth be ye wark of ye sacrament, yat we are of
ye number of ye regenerat, and nurissit be ye halie sacramentis, of Baptism,
and of ye Supper.

Gif it be permittit to use comparisouns, Comparisou^ of ye two halie sacraments
of ye two halie sacramentis of Baptism, and of ye Supper, albeit yat yair be
difference between regeneratioun, ye quhilk is not reiteratit, for it suffisis
to be anis borne, and regeneratit: bot ye nurisment is often reiteratit,
according to ye ordour of nature, and vthers differencis larglie aneuch
discriuit, be ye halie Apostils, and Ministers of ye word of God. Notyeles ye
same end, ye same God, ye same Jesus christ, is representit alsweil in
Baptism, as in ye Supper: be ye blude of Jesus Christ, we are regeneratit: and
be ye same blude nurissit, be ye blude of Jesus Christ we are renewit, impit,
and graftit, and be ye same blude are intertenit, Tit. 3.
and preseruit fra hunger and thrist for ever mair. Ioh. 3.6.
Be ye blude of Jesus Christ we are spoilit of ye auld corruptit skinn, Romans 11.
and cled with his body, quhairof alswa we haif fude and life eternal. Ioh.
6. Galat. 3. Ephesians. 4.
Be ye blude of Jesus Christ, we haif access and entry to ye Kingdom of
heuin, and be ye same blude, we haif fruitioun of ye said Kingdom.

To yis purpose, ye halie Apostil testifies us all to haif been Baptisit, be ye
vertew of ye same halie Gaist, and all to haif dronkin ye self same spiritual
drink, geuin to us be Jesus Christ. Are not yir comparisouns drawin out of ye
halie Scripture, to justify weill, yat Jesus Christ is ye only end, Romans 5.
1. Cor. 10.
to quhilk it behuifis to tend, alsweil be Baptism, as be ye halie Supper. It
followis yan, yt ye signs of ye sacramental water for Baptism, and of bread
and of wine, for ye Supper of Jesus Christ, ar halie signs, arlis, plegis,
weddis, figuris, sealis, and sacramentis institutit of God, for assurance and
approbatioun of our faith. Seeing yan (o Mesmongers) yat e haif inuentit a Magik
of tra^substanciatioun, Aganis ye Mesmo^gers.
for ye sacrament of ye Supper, quhy alswa haif e not subtillie inuentit, ye
same Magik of transubstanciatioun in ye sacrament of Baptism? Quhy haif e not
institutit ye sacramental water, after it hes been be ow coniurit, and adiurit
with salt, to chais away ye Devils, to be tra^substa^ciatit into ye blude of
Jesus Christ, ye water being na mair water, bot ane accident without substance,
as e haif imaginit of ye bread and of ye wine? Quhat difference can e assign,
bot sophistries, sophismis, and subtilities of ye Mess, gif e continue owr
heresy, be yis term, Ioh. 3.4.7. Tit. 3. Galat. 3.
Est, it is alswa found applyit for ye water of Baptism, ye quhilk is callit
renouatioun and regeneratioun, it is callit ye halie Spirit, and ye vestiment
of quhilk, and be quhilk, we are cled, renewit, and regeneratit in ye blude of
Jesus Christ. Aganis ye corruptiou^s of Baptism
Seeing yan yat e (o Mesmongers) acknawlege yat e could not it find a second
Beringarie, to institute a decreit of recanting, to ye effect to extend our
Magik of transubstanciatioun, to ye halie water of Baptism, and be ye same
meanis to transubsta^ciat owr spattils, and halie spittingis, owr oilis, owr
Chrismis, owr salt, and other droggis, quhairwith ^ haif corruptit ye halie
sacrament of Baptism, quhy are e hardnit and growin auld, in owr Pompilian
Religiou^, willing to pluk away Jesus Christ fra ye richt hand of God, to cause
him in body and blude cum down be owr murmurit Magik, as a Jupiter Elicius,
before ye day appointit for his second cumming?

I may weil bring in to ow ye similitude of ye Sune, Luke 1. Malach. 4.
Comparisou^ of ye Sune to Jesus Christ quhilk halie Justin Martyr hes vsitin
his tractat of ye expositioun of faith Cap. 3.
be sum Apostils callit ye Sune of Justice, Jesus Christ: because yat ye licht
cu^mis fra heuin, be yis great lichtsume starne: and alswa ye spiritual licht
is geuin to us be Jesus Christ, yat hes restorit us in licht, out of ye nicht
and darkness of sin. Now yan (o Caphernitis carnal and gros) understand
presently ane comparisoun sufficient aneuch to schaw ow ye infinite power of
God, to be far mair perfect nor owr abhominabil inuentioun of
transubstanciatioun. Will e not acknawlege, gif e haif not ye eine bound, and
blindit in ye deip darkness of obstinacy, yat ye Sune gifis us his licht, his
beamis, his strenth, his heat, and vertew, and notyeles, ye body in it self of
ye Sune, to rest and abide in ye heuin? Say e not ordinarlie in common langage,
quhan ye window of ye house is opin on yat side of ye Sune, yat ye Sune is
entrit in owr house? Neueryeles ye Sune abidis ever in ye heuin: behuifis it to
pluk down and raif ye body of the Sune, to cause it cum down and
transubstanciat it in yis eardlie palaice, before yat he may gif his heat, his
beamis, his licht, and nurissing to plantis, to tries, to herbis, and to
eardlie beistis? Are e swa brutall (o Caphernitis) yat e will not acknawlege ye
true Sune of justice Jesus Christ, to haif far greter power, yan yis sign of
ye Sune, creatit and mortal? Gif yan ye mortal creature, hes yis power to gif
us ye vertew and power of his body, be his beamis, be his licht, be his heat,
extendit on ye ea^d, reallie and effectually ye body ever abiding in ye
heuin: it behuifi weil to belief yat God immortal creator, hes far greter
power to gif us ye Sone of justice Jesus Christ, to gif us ye force and vertew
of his body and blude, sched for us be ye beamis, be ye licht and heit of his
halie Gaist, with out yis yat he war constranit be our magik, to be pluckit
away fra ye richt hand of God, and yat his body be drawin out of heuin, to
cause transubstanciat it on eard. Quhy sal not Jesus Christ haif yis power to
gif us his licht, and offer us his body, and his blude, to enter within us,
gif be faith and in a pure conscience, we will resaif it be ye vertew of his
halie Spirit, alsweil and far better, nor the Sune enters into our housis, in
his force and power, neueryeles, without drawing yairof fra heuin to
tra^substanciat it? The Sune is ane only body creatit, abiding in ye heuin,
ye cause of ye generatioun of plantis, treis, and herbis, yat gifis nurisment
be his force and heit, to all yat is living on ye eard, and in ane verrie
moment, hes power to quickin, warm, and nurisse ane infinitnes of plantis,
treis, herbis, and eardlie beastis, without onie separating or dividing, nor
drawing of his body out of heuin, nor transubstanciating it. The body alswa
of Jesus Christ, quhilk he hes caryit up to heuin, sitting at ye richt hand of
God, hes it not greter force, greter ve^tew, and power, to regenerat us, to
nurisse and seid us, to gif us his vertew, his licht, and his beamis, to
inspire, quickin, sustain, and illuminat us, and in ane verrie moment, to make
us be faith partakers of his body, and of his blude: to make us members of his
members, vnitit in him, and be him, be his veritabil promis comprehendit under
ye elementis and halie signs, left to us until ye second cumming of his
humanity, be manifestit on eard? Quhairfore yan (o Mesmongers) haif e inuentit
yis Magik of transubstanciatioun, to blaspheime aganis God, to diminisse his
power, and esteime his vertew less yan yat of ye Sune his creature? Quhy will e
reg down ye body of Jesus Christ fra heuin, before ye time preordinat, (...)
qui^^^.
to transubstan^^t (...) litill round Hostis vnleuenit, imprintit with Imagi^,
y^^ e cause worschip, seeing Christ as God, assistis perpetually with his Kirk,
and hes ye power to regenerat, nurisse, and feid us: ea with life and eternal
fude, be his promis assurit and testifiit be his halie sacramentis of Baptism,
and of ye halie Supper?

For other comparisounis, familiar and domestical, Vcher comparisouns
consider (o Mesmongers) how eardlie and mortal Princis are reputit,
reuerensit, and honorit be ye sacrit signs or denit of yaim. I will propone to
ow two only, to wit, ye wax and Metals: of ye ane is maid ye seal of ye
prince, quhairwith are sealit ye gracis, pardons, and remissiouns, ye
chartouris and preuilegis, grantit be ye Prince. He yat falsesies ye seal, is
he not punissit as for ye crime of lesemaiesttie, euin as he had offendit ye
proper person of ye Prince? This seal representis it not his proper person,
as gif him self war yair present? Notyeles ye wax, albeit it be callit ye seal
of ye Prince, it is not yairfore transubstanciatit, bot abides ever wax:
albeit yat it hes resauit ye sacrit mark of ye Prince, being na mar callit wax,
bot ye seal of ye prince. The Metals of gold and silver, markit with ye
coinzie of ye Prince, to serve as money, albeit yat yai are not callit onie
mair gold nor silver, bot having changit yair name after ye will of ye prince,
are callit Crownis, Ducatis, Haries, Testouns, schillingis, or other namis,
laif yai of to be Metals, and of ye same substance yat yai war of? Ane only
difference yair is yat yai are destinat and markit with ye coinzie of ye Prince,
quhilk representis him reallie in sick sort, yat he quha clippis or makis falls
yis money, he is punissitas of ye crime of lesemaiestie, and as gif he had
offendit ye proper person of ye Prince. Be far greter ressone ye bread and ye
wine, co^secratit and markit to be sacrame^tis, 1. Cor. 11.
of ye body and blude of Ies^ Christ, represe^tis him in verrie dei^ and not
in a picture. Quhairfore he yat vsis yaim unworthily, commitis crime of
Lesemaiestie aganis God, to his eternal damnatioun. Bot yis is not to infer a
transubsta^ciatioun be ane Magik over abhominabil.

Gif e (o Mesmongers) Nicolaitis, and transubstanciatouris, are not aneuch
satisfiit with ye interpretatioun of Jesus Christ, and his Apostils, ea alswa
of ye similitudis and familiar comparisouns, to reduce ow to ye true way and
certain form ordenit of God, to celebrate his halie Sacramentis, in
abolissing owr Pompiliane and Messaliane Idolatries, casting away alswa owr
abhominabill Magik of transubstanciatiouns, at ye least will e not gif sum
faith to the interpretatioun of ye ancient Doctouris of ye Kirk.

(sayis ye same Doctor) Jesus Christ pronuncit yir wordis, hoe est corpus meum,
yis is my body, in presenting bread, he gaif ye sign of his body. For it
sold appeir vtherwise to be ane vnlesume thing, and over vncourtes, to devour

ye bread to reduce in memory his flesche, Lib. 10. de caut. Cap. 5. ca.

and ye body of Christ to haif been offerit up for our life and eternal fude.

interpretit ye eating of ye body of Jesus Christ, be ye notabil distinctioun
of ye halie Doctor S. Hierom, saying ye flesche of Jesus Christ is understand
carnally, quhan it is spokin of his blude sched, and of his body crucifiit
for our saluatioun: or spirituallie, quhan it is said, yat his flesche is ye
true meat, quhilk it behuifis to eat?

For anuther halie Doctor, S. Gelas. co^^. Eutychio^ and Nestorio^.
I will allege ow Gelasius Bischop of Rome, quha disputing aga^^s ye Heretikis,
Eutychiens, and Nestoriens, affirmis ye bread and ye wine consecratit and maid
sacrame^tis, not to laife of neueryeles to be bread and wine in substance, bot
to be signs and figuris of ye body and blude of Jesus Christ, be ye mystery
of ye sacramentis* will e mair ampill testimonies of Ambros. yat upon ye
Epistil to ye Corinth. S. Ambrois. lib. de sacrament cap. 1. and. 11.
hes exponit to eat and drink ye bread and ye wine to signify ye flesche and
blude of Jesus Christ offerit for us. Origene alswa in his Homelies, Origene.
in Leui. home. li. 7.
hes interpretit ye sacrame^tis to be signs, quhilk it behuifis to examine
spirituallie, and not carnally, because (sayis he) ye letter slais, gif it be
not understand spirituallie, quhan it is writtin, S. Chrisosto. h^^li. 51. ca.

to eat ye flesche of Christ. Quhairfore S. Chrisostom admonissit to honor yis
sacrament, in offering his saul to God, for the quhilk Jesus Christ had been
crucifiit, Psalm. 12.
and yat be this halie sacrament of bread and wine, is signifiit to us ye
similitude of ye body and blude of Jesus Christ.

For resolutioun, it behuifis to be reulit after ye halie interpretatioun of
our halie Doctor Jesus Christ, and of his Apostils, to honor and reverence
his halie sacrame^tis, institutit of him be outward signs, to lift our Spirit
to heuin, to comprehend yat quhilk is be ye signs representit, not to esteime
yaim as vain picturis and fantasies, bot worthelie to resaif yaim in lively
faith, he ye vertew of ye halie Gaist, to ye end to be nurissit and fed of the
heavenly bread, to ye saluatioun of ye saulis, to cum to eternal life. Let us
yan be assurit in Jesus Christ, as members of his body, let us reduce us all
to unity, to communicate ye self same bread, and drink ye self same wine, maid
of money cuirnis, 1. Cor. 12.
vnitit and knit together, to ye end yat we may say with ye halie Apostil, all
us faithful to be ye, body of Jesus Christ, sauit and redemit be ye body
crucifiit, and ye blude sched for us. Swa abiding and remaning be faith in
Jesus Christ, eating him and drinking his blude, let us belief firmly yat he

yairafter ^^ssin, his body gain up to heuin to ane certain place, sitting
at ye richt hand of God, till yat he cum again, as he went up in his humanity,
and neueryeles his power and divinity to be distributit to us, and spread upon
ye eard, and in all placis, specially in his halie Sacramentis, quhilk he hes
left to us as plegis, and ane outward approbatioun of our Faith for memory and
remembrance of the death and Passioun of our Saluiour Jesus, Christ. Amen.
