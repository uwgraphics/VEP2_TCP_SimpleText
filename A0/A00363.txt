A book called in latin Enchiridion militis christiani / and in english the
manuell of the christen knight / replenysshed with most wholesome precepts /
made by the famous clerk Erasmus of Roterdame / to the which is added a new
and meruaylous profitable preface.

The book speaks.
TO please all sorts of men I do not pass
To please the good and learned is a fair thing
ye and these both / were more than covenant was
And more than I look for. who so the lernyng
Of Christ does savor / if he like well althyng
I seek no further / Christ is mine Apollo
Only strengthyng me to speak this that I do.
The printer to the faithful reder.
THe mortal world a field is of battle
which is the cause y^ strife does never fail
Against man / by warrynge of the flesh
with the dyuell / that always fyghteth fresshe
The spyrite to oppress by false envy
The which conflycte is contynually
During his life / and like to lose the field
But he be armed with weapon and shield
Such as behooves to a christen knight
where god echone / by his Christ choseth right
Soole captain / and his standarde to bear
who knows it not / tha^ this will teache him here
In his breuyer / poynarde / or manuell
The love showing of high Emanuell
In gyuynge us such harneys of werre
Erasmus is the only furbyssher
Scouryng the harneys / cankred and aduste
which negligence had so sore fret with ruste
Than champyon receive as thine by right
The manuell of the true christen knight.
Finis
Erasmus Roterdame sends gretyng to the reverend father in Christ (and
lord) the lord Paul Uolzius / the most religyous abbot of the monastery the
which is comenly called Hughes court.
ALl be it most virtuous father that the little book / to the which I have
given this name (...) Enchiridion militis christiani / which many a day a go I
made for my self only / and for a certain friend of mine being utterly
unlearned / has begone to mistyke and displease me the less / for as much as I
do se that it is allowed of you and other virtuous and learned men such as you
be / of whom (as ye are in deed endued with godly learning / and also with
learned godliness) I know nothing to be approved / but that which is both
holy and also clerkly: yet it has begone well nyghe also to pleas^^ and like me
now / when I se it (after that it has been so often times printed) yet still to
be desired and greatly called for / as if it were a new work made of late: if
so be ye printers do not lie to flatter me withal. But again there is an
other thing which often times greueth me in my mind / that a certain well
learned friend of mine long a go said / very properly and sharply checkynge me
/ that there was more holiness seen in the little book than in the hole
authoure and maker thereof. In deed he spoke these words in his iestyng
bourdyngly / but would to god he had not spoken so trewly as he bourded
bytterly. And that greueth me so mo^^^ he more because ye same thing has
chaunsed to come likewise to pass in him / for the chaungyng of whose manners
principally I took upon me this labor and travail / for he also not only
has not withdrawn him self from the court / but is daily much deper drowned
therein than he was before time / for what good purpose I can not tell / but as he
confesses him self with much great mysery. Trouble or aduersyte corrects
some.
And yet for all that I do not greatly pety my friend / because that
peradventure aduersyte of fortune may teache him ones to repent him self / and
to amend / seeing that he would not follow and do after my counsel and
admonytions. And verily though I / enforsynge me to the same thing and purpose
/ have been turned and tossed with so many chances and tempests / that Ulixes
a man living ever in trouble (which Homer speaks of) might be counted in
comparyson to me even Polycrates Fortunate Polycrates.
/ which ever lived in prosperyte without any manner trouble. I do not utterly
repent me of my labor / seeing it has moved and provoked so many unto the
study of godly virtue: nor I my self am not utterly to be blamed and rebuked
although my living be not in all points agreynge to mine own precepts and
cou^sayles. It is some part of godliness when one with all his heart desires
and is wyllyng to be made good and virtuous: nor such a mind so well
intending I suppose is not to be cast away / although his purpose be not ever
luckely performed. To this we ought to endeuoyre our self all our life long
/ and no doubt but by the reason that we so often times shall attempt it / ones
at the last we shall attain it. Also he has dispatched a good piece of a
doutfull journey which has learned well of the journey the way. Therefore am I
nothing moved with y^ mockes of certain psons which dispyse this little book /
as nothing erudite and clerkly / saying that it might have been made of a child
that lerneth his A / b / c / because it entreats nothing of Dunces
questyons: as though nothing without those could be done wih learning. I do not
care if it be not so quick / so it be godly: let it not make them instruct and
ready to disputacyons in schools / so that it make them apt to keep Christ's
peace. Let it not be profitable or helpyng for y^ disputacyon in diuynite / so
it make for a divine life. For what good should it do to entreat of that thing
that every man entremedleth with? who has not in handlyng questions of
diuynite / or what (...) do all our swarms of schole men? There be almost as
many co^mentaryes upon y^ master of the sentence as be names of diuynes. There
is neither mesure nor nombre of summularies / which after the manner of
potycaries myngle often times sundry things together / and make of old
things new / of new things old / of one thing many / of many things one.
How can it be that these great volumes instruct us to live well and after a
christen manner / which a man in all his life can not have layser ones to look
over. In like manner as if a phisycien should prescribe unto him that lies
sick in parell of death to read Iacobus de partibus / or such other huge
volumes / saying that there he should find remedy for his disase: but in the
mean time the pacyent dies / wantynge present remedy wherewith he might be
helped. In such a fugytyue life it is necessary to have a ready medycyne at the
hand. How many volumes have they made of restytucion / of confession / of
sclaunder / and other things innumerable? And though they boulte and search
out by pecemeale every thing by it self / and so diffyne every thing as if
they mistrusted all other men's wits / ye as though they mistrusted y^
goodness and mercy of god / whiles they do prescribe how he ought to punish
and reward every fact either good or bad: yet they agree not amongst the^
selves / nor yet somtymes do open the thing plainly / if a man would look nere
upon it / so much dyuersyte both of wits and circumstaunces is there.
Moreover although it were so that they had determined all things well and
trewly / yet besides this that they handle and treat of these things after a
barbarous and unpleasant fassyon / there is not one amongst a thousand that
can have any layser to read over these volumes: The great volumes.
Or who is able to bear about with him Secundam secunde / the work of saint
Thomas? And yet there is no man but he ought to use a good life / to the which
Christ would that the way should be plain and open for every man / and that
not by inexplicable crokes of disputations / not able to be resolved / but by a
true and a sincere faith and charity not feigned / whom hope does follow
which is never asshamed. The theology appertains to few men / but the
salvation appertay^eth to all.
And finally let the great doctors / which must needs be but few in
comparyson to al other men / study and besy them self in those great volumes.
And yet never the less the unlearned and rude multitude which Christ dyed
fo^^^ght to be provided for: and he has taught a great porcyon of christyan
virtue which has inflamed men unto the love thereof. The wise king when he
did teach his son true wisdom / took much more pain in exhorting him
thereunto than in teaching him / as who should say that to love wysdom were in a
manner to have attained it. Those be no^^^ that of purpose make the (...) which
they (...)
It is a great shame and rebuke both for lawyers and phisycions that they have
of a set purpose / and for the nones / made their art and science full of
diffyculty / and hard to be attained or come by / to thentent that both their
gaynes and auau^tage might be the more plentyfull / and their glory and praise
among the unlearned people the greater: but it is a much more shameful thing
to do the same in the philosophy of Christ: But rather contrary wise we ought
to endeuer our selves with all our strengthes to make it so easy as can be / and
plain to every man. Nor let not this be our study to apere learned our selves /
but to alure very many to a christen man's life. The warr^ against the turks.
Preparacyon and ordinance is made now for war to be made against the
turks / which for what so ever purpose it is begone / we ought to pray not
that it may turn to y^ profit of a few certain persons / but that it may
be to y^ ^^men and general profit of all men. But what think you should come
of it / if to such of them as shall be ouercomen (for I do not suppose y^ they
shall all be killed with weapons) we shall lay the works of Occam / Durandus /
Duns / Gabriell / Aluaros / or any such schole men / for thentent to bring the^
in mind to take Christ's professyon upon them? what shall they ymagyn and
think in their minds (for surely even they / though they be naught else / are
men and have wit and reasone) when they shall here those thorny and combrous
inextricable subtle ymagynacions of insta^tes / of formalytes / of quiddites /
of relacion: namely when they shall se these great doctors and teachers of
religyon and holiness so far disagreyng / and of so sundry opinyons among

them self y^ often times they dispute and reason so long one with another /
until they change color and be pale / and reuyle one another spytting each
at other and finally dealing buffettes and blows each to other, when they
shall se y^ black freres fight and skolde for their Thomas / and than the gray
freres matched with them / defendyng on y^ other party their subtyle and
fervent hot doctors / which they call se^aphicos / some spekyng as reals /
some as nomi^^^s. when they shall also se the thing to be ofso great diffyculte
y^ they can never discuss suffycie^tly with what words they may speak of
Christ: as though one did deal or had to do with a waywarde spyrit which he
had raised up unto his own distructyon / if he did fail never so little in the
prescript words of co^^uryng / and not rather with our most merciful savior
/ which desires nothing else of us but a pure life and a simple. I beseech the
for the love of god show m^ what shall we bring about with all these
reckenynges / specially if our manners and our life be like to y^ proud
doctrine and lernyng? The life used amongst christen people.
and if they shall se and well perceive our ambycion and desyrousnesse of
honor by our gorgyousnesse / more tha^ ever any tyra^t did use: our auaryce
and covetousness by our bribyng and pollyng / our lecherousnesse by y^
defyling of maidens and wives / our cruelnes by y^ oppressions done of us? with
what face or how for shame shall we offer to them y^ doctrine of Christ which
is far away contrary to all these things. The best way and most effectuell
to overcome with what artylery chefely the turks ought to be ouerco^e.
and win the turks / should be if they shall perceive y^ thing which Christ
taught and expressed in his living / to shine in us. If they shall perceive y^
we do not hyghly gape for their empyres / do not ^^sire their gold and good /
do not covet their possessyon / but that we seek nothing else but only their
souls health and the glory of god. This is that right true and effectuous
diuynite / the which in time passed subdued unto Christ arroga^t and proud
philosophers / and also the mighty and invincible princes: And if we thus do /
than shall Christ ever be present and help us. The part of a christen man is
to save and not to distroy.
For trewly it is not mete nor convenient to declare our selves christen men by
this proof or token / if we kill very many / but rather if we save very many:
not if we se^de thousa^des of hethen people to hell / but if we make many
infydels faithful: not if we cruelly curse and excomunycate the^ / but if we
with devout prayers and with all our hertes desire their health and pray unto
god to send the^ better minds. If this be not our intent it shall so^er come
to pass y^ we shall degenerate and turn in to turks our selves / than that
we shall cause the^ to become christen men. And although y^ chance of war /
which is ever doutfull and uncertain / should fall so luckely to us y^ we had
gotten the victory / so should it be brought to pass that the popes domynion and
his cardynals might be enlarged / but not the kingdom of Christ The kingdom
of Christ.
/ which finally florissheth and is in prosp^^^^^ if faith / love / peace /
and chas^yte be quick and strong / which thing I trust shall be brought to
pass by y^ good governance and prouisyon of the pope Le^ the tenth / unless
the great trouble and rage of worldly business pluck him from his very good
purpose another way. Christ does profess to be primate and heed him self in
the heavenly kingdom / which never does florisshe but when celestyall things
be advanced. Nor Christ did not dye for this purpose that goods of the world
/ that richesse / that armure / and the rest of rufflynge fassyon of the world
/ be now in the hands and rule of certain priests / which things were
wont to be in the hands of the gentiles / or at the leest amongst lay
princes / not much differyng from gentyles. But in my mind it were ye best /
before we should try with them in battle to attempt them with epystels and
some little books: but with what manner of epystels? Not with thretnyng pystels
/ or with books full of tyranny / but with those which might show fatherly
charity / and resemble the very heart and mind of Peter and Paul / and which
should not only pretend and show outwardly the title of ye apostels / but
which also should savor and taste of the effycacy and strength of the apostels.
The diffyculte of the holy scripture.
Not because I do not know that all the true fountain and vain of Chri^tes
philosophy is hid in the gospel and the epystels of the apostels: But the
strange manner of phrase / and often times the troublous speaking of diverse
crooked fygures and tropes be of so great diffyculte / that often times we our
self also must labor right sore before we can perceive them. Therefore in
mine oppinyon the best were that some both well learned men and good of living
should have this office assigned and put unto them / to make a collectyon and to
gather the some of Christ's philosophy out of the pure fountain of the gospel
and the epystels and most approved interpretours / and so plainly that yet it
might be clerkly and erudyte / and so breuely that it might also be plain. The
breuenes of Christ's doctrine.
Those things which concern faith or believe / let them be contained in a
few artycles. Those also that appertain to the manner of living let them be
showed and taught in few words / and that after such fassyon that they may
perceive the yoke of Christ to be pleasant and easy / and not grievous and
paynfull: so that they may perceive that they have gotten fathers and not
tyrants / feders and not robbers / ^^llers nor pollers / and that they be
called to their soul health / and not compelled to seruytude. The turken be
men.
Undouted they also be men / neither their hertes be of so hard iron or
adamante but that they may be molyfyed and won with benefits and kyndnesse /
wherewith even very wild beestes be woren gentle and tame. And the most
effectuous thing is the true veryte of Christ. But let the pope also
command them whom he appoynteth to this business / that they never swerve
nor go from the true patron and example of Christ / nor in any place have any
respect to the carnal affectes and desires of men. And such a thing my
mind was about to bring to pass as well as I could / when I made this
book of Enchiridion. The corrupt^^nesse of the world.
I did se the comen people of christendom / not only in effect / but also in
opinyons to be corrupted. I consydred the most part of those which profess
themselves to be pastors and doctors to abuse the tytles of Christ to their
propre advantage. And yet will I make no mencyon of those men after whose will
and pleasure the world is ruled and turned up and down / whose vices though
they be never so manifest / a man may scarsely ones wynche. And in such great
darkness / in such great troublous rufflynge of the world in so great
dyuersyte of men's opynions / whyther should we rather fly for socour than to
the very great and sure anchor The sure anchor.
of Christ's doctrine / which is the gospel. who being a good man in deed /
does not se and lamente this meruaylous corrupt world? when was there ever
more tyranny? when did auaryce reign more largely and less punysshed? when
were cyremonyes at any time more in estymacion^ when did our iniquyte so
largely flow with more lyberty? when was ever charity so cold? what is
brought / what is read / what is decreed or determined but it tastes and
sauoureth of ambytion and lucre? Oh how unfortunate were we if Christ had not
left some sparks of his doctrine unto us / and as it were lively and
everlasting veins of his godly mind. Hereto therefore we must enforce our
self to know these sparks / leauyng the coals of men's fantasyes: In things
confused we must have recourse to the ^^gyles.
Let us seek these veins until we find fresshe water which springs in to
everlasting life. we delue and dygge ye ground meruaylously deep for to pluck
out richesse / which nouryssheth vice: And shall we not labor than the rich
earth of Christ to get out that thing which is our souls health? There was
never no storm of vices that did so overcome and quench the heat of charity
/ but it might be restored again at this flynt stone. ^. Co^n.x.
Christ is a stone / but this stone has sparks of celestyall fire / and
veins of lively water. Gene xvj.
In time passed Abraham in every land did dygge pyttes and holes / sertchynge
in every place the veins of lively water: but those same being stopped by
again by the phylistyens with earth / Isaac and his servants Gene.xxvj.
did delue again / and not being only content to restore the old / did also
make new. But than the philistyans did scolde and chyde / yet he did not cease
from dyggynge. And in this our time we have phylistyans The (...) of our tim^
which do prefer y^ naughty earth to the lively fou^taynes / even those
which be worldly wise / and have their respect to erthly things / and wringe
and wraste gods doctrine and his gospel to their carnal affections / making
it serve to their ambycion / bolstryng up therewith their fylthy lucre and
tyranny. And if now any Isaac or any of his family should dyg and find some
true and pure vain / by and by they brable and cry against him / perceiving
right well that that vain should hurt their aduau^tage / should hurt their
ambycion / although it ma^^ never so much for the glory of Christ:
streyghtwayes they cast in naughty earth / and with a corrupt interpretacyon
they stop up the vain / and drive away ye dygger: or at the least they make it
so muddy with claye and fylthynesse / that who so ever drinks thereof shall
draw unto him more slyme and naughtynesse than he shall good lycour. Hiere
(...)
They will not that those y^ thurst and desire ryghtousnesse do drink of the
pure lycoure / but they bring them unto their old worn and all trodden
cesternes / which have broken stones and mortar / but water they have none.
But yet for all this the very true children of Isaac that be the true
worshyppers of Christ / must not be weryed and driven away from this labor:
for verily even they which thrust naughty earth in to the fountain of the
gospel / would be counted the very worshyppers of Christ. So that in deed
nothing now adays is more peryllous than to teach trewly Christ's learning
/ so greatly have the philistyens prevailed fyghtyng for their earth /
preaching erthly things for celestyall / and men's inuencyons for gods
commandments: that is to say / not teaching those things which make for ye
glory of Christ / but those things which be for their own aduau^tage /
which be pardons The marcha^tes of pard^n^
/ composycions / and such like pelfare. And these they do so much more
peryllously because they cloak their covetousness with the tytles and names of
great princes / of the pope of Rome / ye of Christ also him self. But there is
no man that does more for the popes profit or business / than he that
teaches Christ's lernyng purely and truly / whereof he is ye chief teacher.
There is no man that does more good to princes or deserves more of the^ / than
he which indeuereth him self y^ the people may be welthy and in prosperity.
But some of the flock of schole men will here speak against me / saying it is
easy to any man to give general precepts what is to be desired and what is to
be eschewed: but what shall be answered than to those that ask counsel for so
many fortunes and chau^ces? First I answer y^ there be mo diverse kinds of
such worldly business tha^ that any living person can give dyrecte and sure
answer to each one of the^. A man can make no certain answer to every thing.
Secondaryly there is such diuersyte of cyrcumstau^ces / which if a man do
not know / it is not well possible to make an answer. In conclusion I doubt
greatly whether they the^ selves have any sure answer y^ they may make / seeing
they differ in so many things amongst themselves. And those also which
amongst them be more wise than other do not thus answer: This ye shall do /
this ye shall not do / but of this manner. This in mine oppynion were the better
/ this I suppose to be tolerable. But if we have that simple and bright eye
which the gospel speaks of / if the house of our mind have in it the
candell of pure faith The light of faith.
set upon a candelstycke / all these tryfles shall easyly be put away and
avoided as it were clouds or mystes.

If we have the rule and patron of Christ's charity / to it we may apply and
make met^ all other things right easily. But what will ye do when this rule
does not agree with those things which has be comenly used so many hundred
years / and which be ordained and stablysshed by the laws of princes / for
this thing chau^seth very of^e. ye must not condemn y^ thing which princes
do in executynge their office / but again do not corrupt and defyle the
heavenly philosophy with men's deeds. Let Christ Christ is the Center.

going round about him: move not the mark out of his own place. Those
which be in the first cyrcle the first of me^ of the church
next to the center (that is to say ^^^t to Christ) as priests / bishops /
cardynalles / po^es / and such to whom is belongs to follow the lamb whyder
so ever he shall go / let them enbrace and hold fast that most pure part /

be / which in keeping war and making laws / after a certain manner do
service to Christ / either when with ryghtfull battle they drive away their
enemies / and defend and maintain the publyke peace and tranquilyte of the
comen welthe: or else when with punysshment acordyng to y^ laws / they punyssh
malefactors and yuell doers. And yet because they can not chose but of
necessyte be occupied and besyed in such things as be joined with the most
vile dregs and fylthe of the earth / and with the business of y^ world / it
is ieopardous lest they do fall further from the center and mark / as lest
they should make somtymes war for their own pleasure / and not for the comen
welthe: lest under the pretext of justice they should use crueltye upon those
whom they might refourme with mercy: lest under the title of lordshyp they
should pyll and polle those people whose goods they ought to defend. And
moreover as Christ like y^ fountain of everlasting fire / does draw next unto
him the order of priests / and makes them of like nature / that is to say
pure and clean from all corrupcyon of worldly dregs and fylthynysse: The
office of Sacerdotes.
So in like case it is the office of priests / and specially of y^ highest /
somoche as they can to call and draw unto them those that be princes and have
power and authorite. And if it fortune at any time that war do rise suddenly
in any place / let the bysshoppes endeuoyre them selves so much as in them is
/ either to end the stryues and varyaunces without shedyng of blood: or if
that can not be brought to pass / by reason of the great storms of worldly
business / yet let them so do that as little blood as may be be shed / and
that the war may shortly be brought to an end. In times paste the bysshoppes
authorite had place even in just punysshmentes / and has gotten diverse times
(as saint Augustyne Augustyne.
plainly in his epistle does testyfye) the malefactor from the hands of
temperall iuges. For some things there be so necessary unto the order of the
comen welthe that partly yet Christ did dissymule at them / and partly he put
them from him / and partly neither approuynge nor disalowyng them did in a
manner wynke and look beside them. He would not know the money of Caesar nor ye
scripture upon it. what things and how farforth they apertayn to the heedes of
the church
The trybute he commanded to be paid if it were due and debt / as though it
little pertayned to him / so that god had his duty. The woman taken and found
in adultery he neither condemned neither openly absolved / but only did bid
her y^ she should no more do so. Of those which were condemned of Pylate /
whose blood he entremyngled amongst their sacryfyces / he neither said it
was well done nor yuell / but only threttened every man that they should be
punysshed with a like distructyon if they did not amend.

More over when he was desired to deuyde the enherytau^ce between y^ two
brethren / he plainly refused it as an unworthy thing for him to give judgment
of such gross matters / which did teache things heavenly. And also of the other
part there be certain things which he openly abhorred / as y^ covetous
phariseys / the ypocrytes / the proud rich folks / saying unto them woe be
unto you. He never rebuked what things christ openly rebuked.
y^ apostels more sharply than when they would have been aue^ged / or wha^ they
were ambycious. when they asked him whether they should command fire to be
sent down from heaven to have burned up the cite from whence they were shyt
forth / he answered and said to the^ / ye know not of what spyrit ye are. wha^
Peter was about to have called him unto ye world from his passyo^ suffri^g / he
called him an adversary. wha^ they co^te^ded about p^emine^ce which of the^
should be ye best / how often and how many ways does he call the^ back to
a contrary mind? what things christ teaches openly.
And other things there be which he teaches and commands openly to be
observed / as not to resyst yuel / to do good to thine enemies / to use
meekness of mind / and other like. These must be departed in sondre / and
every of the^ set in order in his own place. Princes laws or of the mean sort
of things
Let us not therefore strayte ways make Christ an auctoure of all things
which be done by princes and temporal officers / nor defend it (as we call
it) to be done by gods law. They deal and meddle with many things which
be low and gross / not al together of the very pureness of a christen man:
yet they be not to be rebuked in as much as they be necessary to the
maynteynau^ce of order to be observed. Nor we be not by the mynistrynge of
their office made good / all be it that by the^ it is caused that we be less
yuell / and that they which be yuell do less hurt and noyaunce to the comen
welthe. And therefore they also ought to have their honor because they do
somewhat serve the justice of god and the publyke and comen tranquilyte /
without the which sometime those things be troubled and vexed which belong to
godly holiness. They must be honored when they do their office: and if
somtymes they use their power for their own pleasure or profit / yet
peradventure it were the best to suffer Evil rulers must be suffered
them / lest more hurt should spring thereof: for there apereth an image or
rather a shadow of the divine justice in them / which justice yet ought to
shine more euydently and more purely in the living and laws of priests. An
image does of another manner show in a myrrour of glass / than it does in
iron. And in the third cyrcle The third Cyrcle.
must all the comen people be / as the most gross part of all this world /
but not yet so gross but that they pertayne unto the mistycall body of Christ:
for the eyes be not only members of the body / but also the legs / the fete /
and the privy parts. And those which be in the third cyrcle we ought so to
suffer in their infirmyte / y^ as much as is possible we do call them unto
those things which be more approved of Christ. For in the mistycal body he
that but late was the foot may be the eye. And like as the princes if they be
not all the best / must not with chyding be exasperate / lest (as saint
Augustyne says) when they be moved they stir up more peryllous tragedyes /
so the weak people like as Christ suffered his apostels and nourysshed them /
must be suffered / and after a fatherly manner cherysshed until they were more
aged and strong in Christ. The weak must be forborne.
For godliness also has his infancye / it has mean age / it has full
strength and perfyte age. yet all men after their degree must endeuoyre them
self to attain and come unto Christ. The elements have every one his propre
place / but the fire which has the highest place by little and little draws
all the other unto him / and so much as he can tourneth them in to his nature.
The change of one Elemente in to an other.
The clear water he tourneth in to the air / and the air clarifyed he
transfourmeth into his own nature. Saint Paul does in many things suffer
and pardon the Corynthyans / but in the mean season putting difference
between those things which he did profer in the name of his lord unto them
that were perfyte / and those things which he did pardon that were written in
his own name to them that were yet weak and young in Christ: but ever on this
trust y^ they should profit and go forward to more strength and perfectyon.
And also he trauayleth again to bring forth the galathyans until Christ be
fassyoned in them.

Now if any man will think this cyrcle to be more conuenyent for princes / I
will not strive greatly with him. But what so ever is without the third cyrcle
is at all times and in all points to be hated and refused / as ambycion and
desire of money / lechery / ire / vengeance / envy / backbytyng / and such
other pestylences / which than only be made incurable / when they disgysed
with the vyser and cloak of holiness and virtue do crepe in to the cyrcle
before spoken: that is when under the pretexte of executynge the law and
justice we use our tyranny. when by the occasyon of religyon we provide for
great lucre. when under the title of defendyng the church we hunte for worldly
power and authoryte: and when soever those things be commanded as things
pertaynyng unto Christ which be disagreynge much from his learning. Therefore
the mark must be set before every man which they ought to shote at: and
there is but one mark The mark may not be changed.
/ which is Christ and his most pure learning. If thou set forth a
worldly mark in the stead of a celestyall mark / than shall there be nothing
whereunto a man ought justly enforce him self / which labors to profit and
go forward. Every man ought to enforce him self to that which is best and
most perfyte Al must labor to perfytnesse.
/ that at the least we may attain and come to the mean things. And there
is no cause why we should put away any kind or manner of living from this
mark.

The perfectyon of Christ consists only in the affectes / and not in the
manner or kind of living: it consysteth in the minds and not in the garments
or in meats and drinks. There be among the monks which be scarce able to
be put in ye third cyrcle / and yet I speak of those which be good / but yet
weak and not perfyte. There be amongst these that have had two wives which
Christ thinks worthy for the first cyrcle. Nor yet in the mean time I do no
wrong to any manner of living or professyon / though I propounde and set forth
before every man that thing which is best and most perfyte: Unless ye would
think Plato to have done injury against all cytes because in his book of the
gouernynge of a cite or a comen welthe / he feigned such example of a comen
welthe / as yet never any man could se. Or except ye do think that Quintilian
has hurt the hole order of orators / because he feyned such an example of an
orator as yet never was. And though thou be far from the princypall and
chief patron Christ / thou art not yet therefore cast away / but extymulate
and moved to go forward and profit. Art thou nere the mark? than art thou
monysshed and counsayled to aproche more nere: for there was never yet any man
that went so far forward / but that he might have gone much more nere the
mark. There is no kind of living but it has some peryllous points annexed
unto it / to cause men to degenerate from the truth: and who so ever shows
those ieopardous and dangerous points / does not derogate or mynisshe
thonour of the order / nor speak against it / but rather is for the profit
thereof. As the felicyte of princes The comen vices of princes
is in danger to fall into tyranny / is in danger and ieopardy of
folysshnesse and flateryng / now who so ever shows those dangers to be
eschewed / does deserve thanks of the order of princes. Nor he does not speak
against their majesty / wherein they glory / which does show in what things
their very majesty does co^syste / which also does put them in remembrance
whereto they were sworn when they took their authorite: what is their duty
unto their people / and what they ought to do unto their officers. Bishops and
other.
The heedes and rulers of the church have in a manner affynite with two
pestylent vices / auaryce and ambycion / which well perceyuyng saint Peter ^.
petri.v.
the chief pastor next unto Christ / does monysshe the bysshoppes to feed
their flock / and not to pyll / poll / and fley them: Nor that they should not
feed them because of any fylthy advantage / but of their free and ready will:
nor that they should use them self as lords upon them / but that by the
example of life / they should provoke them to godliness rather than by
thretnynge and power. Does he than speak against the order of priests which
does show by what means / and how the bishops may trewly be great / mighty
/ and rich? More over the kind of religyous men is accompanied most comenly
(besides other enormytes) with superstycion To which vices the common sort of
monks be prove. A sentence.
/ pride / ypocrysy / and backbytyng. He does not strayte condemn their
manner of living which does show and admonysshe them in what things most
true religyon does stand or rest / and how much the true godliness of a
christen man is away from pride / and how far true charity is from all
feynynge and disceyte: how much backbytyng and slaundring and venemousnesse
of tongue is contrary to pure and true holiness. And specially if he show what
is to be eschued after such sobre and discrete manner / that he do neither name
any man nor touch any order. A sentence.
what thing is that in this mortal life so fortunate and prosperous / but
has some pestylent things annexed unto it? Therefore like as he does not noye
the health of the body but helps it / who so ever shows what things
corrupts health and what things preserves it: so does not dissuade men from
religyon / but exhorts them rather unto it / which shows the corruptous
infections thereof and also the remedies. The quarrel of some persons.
For I am infourmed that there be diverse which so judges of this book / as
though the precepts thereof did withdraw and turn away men's minds from the
life of relygyous men / because they do not so much praise and allow
cyremonyes neither yet man's constytucions as some would / which in deed over
much regard them. And there can be nothing so circumspectly spoken / but
that thereof leude and yuell persons done take occasyon either of quarellynge
or else of synnynge: So that it is daungerfull now a days to any man to teach
any thing well. Nothing is ^re from the cauelacion of lewd persons.
If a man should dissuade from such war and battle which now of long
time has been used / worse than was ever any amongst the gentyles / for
things of no valor / he should be noted by and by of the pyke-quarelles to be
one of those which that thinks that no war is lawful for a christen man.
For these which were the bringers up and auctours of this sentence we have
made heretykes / because a pope / I wotte not who / does seem to approve and
allow war. And yet he is not suspected nor noted of heresy / which does
provoke and stir up men to battle Battle.
/ and blows the trumpet thereunto for every tryfelynge matter / against the
doctrine both of Christ and of his apostels. If a man admonysshe that this is
a deed trewly belonging to the successor of an apostle to bring the turks
unto relygion with Christ's help / rather than with war: anon he is
suspected as though he affyrmed not to be laufull for christen men to
withstand the turks / when they invade us. Pouerte.
If a man show and praise the temperaunce that was in the apostels / and speak
any thing against the great superfluyte that is used now adays / he should be
noted as a favorer of the Ebyonytes. And if a man did exhort dyligently that
these which be married / should rather be joined together by the consentes and
agreyng of their minds / than by the enbrasynges of their bodies / and so
purely to use matrymonye / that as much as might be it were made like to
virgynite: he should be anon suspected to think that every act of matrymonye
were sin and unlawful / as the marcionytes did. If a man do admonysshe that
in exercise and disputacyons / specially of diuynite / there should be no
ambycious pertynacy to overcome his fellow in defending his own opinyons /
nor no ambycion to show what they can do in comen places: he is wrongfully
accused as though he did co^dempne utterly all schole learning. Nor saint
Augustyne when he gives warning to the logyciens that they should be ware of
lust to braule and chyde / does not co^dempne logike / but shows y^
pestylence thereof that it might be eschewed. The subuerte^ judgment of
virtues and vyc^
Also he does not disprayse virtue nor praise vice / which shows the
preposterous and wrong judgment of the comen people / which among virtues
esteem those to be of most great valu^e and chefest which be of the lowest
sort: and among vices most sore hates and abhors those most small fautes
and tryfles / and so contrary wise. Anon he is accused as though he should
favor those vices which he shows to be more grievous than other / and as
though he should condemn those good deeds and benefytes to whom he
prefers other more holy and better. As if a man did admonisshe and give us
warning / that it is more sure to trust unto good deeds than to trust to the
popes pardone Pardons.
/ yet he does not forsothe condemn the popes pardons / but prefers that
which by Christ's learning and doctrine is of more certayntye. Also if a man
do teach those for to do better which tarry at home and provide for their wife
and children / than those which goo to se Rome / Jerusalem They which go to
jerusalem do no great thing.
/ or saint James / and that money which they should spend in that long and
peryllous journey to be better and more devoutly spente upon poor folks / yet
condempneth not he their good intent / but prefers that which is more nere
to very godlynes. And this is a thing not only used now in our time but also
in times here tofore past / to abhor some vices as though there were none
other / fawnynge upon the rest as they were no vices at all when in very deed
they be more detestable than those which we so hate and abhor. Only volupt^
^^^nes is abho^red in sacer ^o^e^.
Saint Augustyne does complain in his epystels that lastimyousnesse of the
flesh is only imputed unto the priests of Affryke as a vice / and that the
vice of covetousness and drunkenness be taken well nygh for a praise. This
specially we speak most against / and cry out upon and exagerate for an
excedyng abhomynable fact / if one touch the body of Christ with the same
hands wherewith he has touched the body of a harlotte. And there be some over
ragyng bold that be not a frayde openly to affirm that it is less sin for
a woman to commytte carnal act with a brute be than to lie with a priest.
Now he that somthynge rebukes their vnshamfastnesse / does not therefore
favor the naughtynesse of priests / but shows that they regard not those
offenses which be a great deal more to be cried out upon. But if a priest be
a dysar / a fyghter A sacerdote b^^ynge a dycer or fyghter.
/ a brauler / al unlearned / drowned and wrapped in temporal business / all
given to the yuell service of yuell princes / yet against him they cry
nothing at all which all together worldely and polluted does handle and
entremeddle with holy mysteryes. when a priest is a flatterer or a pyke quarrel

/ which with his bitter tongue and false lies does hurt the names of those
which never offended him / but rather has done him pleasures / why do we not
now cry out? Oh what an horrible sin is this to receive thy lord god /
which suffered his passion for sinners with yt tongue which is full of poison
of hell / and with y^ mouth wherewith thou kyllest and sleest an innocent. But
this yuell and vngracyousnesse we set so little by y^ in a manner those men are
even praised for it / which profess them selves to be the most religyous
amongst relygyous men. There is no man that denies but they be to be
reprehended and sore rebuked which nourysshe and keep at home co^cubynes / to
the yuell example of all the comen people: but yet these other yuel vices be
more hateful to god. Nor he does therefore say that butter is naught which
says that honey is better and more to be preferred: Nor yet does not approve
the fever that counsayleth the phrenesy more to be avoided. And it is hard to
tell and express how great infection of manners and disposycion does spring of
these peruers and wrong iugeme^tes. (...)
There be diverse things now a days received in to the order of virtues /
which rather have the vyser and apparaunce of godliness than the nature and
strength of it / in so much that unless me look well unto them and take good
head of them / they do quench and utterly distroye virtue. If it had been but a
little pestylence of relygyon which in cyremones do lie couerte / Paul would
never so sharply have spoken against the^ in all his epystels. And yet do not
we condemn in any place cyremonyes that be moderatly observed / but that al
holiness be ascrybed unto them we can not suffer. Cyremonyes be of the mea^
sort.
Saint Augustyne A rule of saint Augustyne.
did prohybyte those of the clergy which were in house with him to use any
notable vesture / but if they would be commended of y^ people / that they
should rather bring that to pass by their manners and virtuous living than by
any sundry fassyon of raiment. But now a days it is a world for to se what
new and wonderful fassyons of aparayle and vesture there be. The rules of men.
But yet I speak not against that / but this I marvel of / that those things
are so over much regarded and set by / which peradventure might by right be
reprehended. And again that those things be so little regarded which we
should only behold and regard. I do not rail against the gray freres and
black monks that they make much of their own rule / but because certain of
them regard more their own rules than they do the gospel: which thing would
to god were not found in the most part of them. I do not speak against that
/ that some eat fysshe / some live with yerbes / other with eggs: but I
admonysshe those to err and to be far out of the way which will of those
things justify them selves after the manner of the jews / thinking them self
better / and preferrynge them self to other for such tryfles of men's
inuencyon / and take it for no defaulte atall to hurt another man's good name
with false lies. Dyuersyte of meats.
Of the dyuersyte of meat and drink Christ never commanded any thing / nor
the apostels: But Paul often times did dissuade us from it.

Christ curses bitter slaundringe / which also all the apostels does detest
and abhor: and yet that not withstandyng we will apere relygyous in such
using of meats / and in hurtyng men's fame we be bold and hardy. I pray
you think you that he which does admonysshe these both in general not
touching any man / and also louyngly / does hurt relygyon? who is so mad
that he would be accounted eloquent for showing and bringynge to light the
vices that belongen to monks? But these peradventure fear leest their
couentes and brethren would be less obedye^t / and leest also there do not so
many desire to be shaven in to their order: yet verily / no man is more
obedye^t to his heed than he which inspyred with the holy ghost is free and at
liberty. True and very charity takes all things well in worth / and
suffers all things / refuses nothing / is obedyent unto rulers / not only
to those that be sobre and gentle / but also to those that be sharp and rough.
The inferyours obedience may not be abused.
But yet rulers must be wise of this that they do not turn the obedyence of
other men in to their own tyranny / and that they had lever therefore to have
them superstycious than holy and virtuous / whereby they might be more obedyent
at every beck. They have pleasure to be called fathers: but what carnal
father is there that would have his children ever infa^tes and young because he
might use his power upon them at his own pleasure? And of the other part all
those y^ purpose to profit in ye lyberty of Christ / this they must beware of
/ leest as saint Paul does admonysshe they make their lyberty a cloak or
covert to their carnal living: Or as saint Peter teaches / with their
lybertye they make a cover and a cloak to malyciousnesse. And if that one or
two do abuse this lyberty / yet it is not right forthwith that all other
therefore be ever kept in superstyciousnesse and bondage of cyremonyes like unto
y^ jews. And who so ever will mark it shall perceive y^ amongst these
religious me^ no man causes ye cyremonies to be more straightly observed tha^
they which under y^ precepts thereof does bear rule and serve their bellyes
rather tha^ Christ. More over they need not be afraid lest such kind of
essenes be not enough spread a broad in so great dyuersyte of men's natures /
whereby it is caused that nothing is so unreasonable but diverse and many will
love and desire it / although their selves ought more to desire that they had
true professors of religyon rather tha^ many. The more religyous a man is the
less he yeldeth to cyremonyes.
But would to god that it were provided and ordained by a law y^ no man should
be taken in such snares before he were.xxx. years of age / before he somthyng
knew him self / or knew what the nature and virtue of true religyon is.
^^th. xxii^.
But these which like unto the phariseys / doing their own business and
prouydynge for their own profit / wa^der about to make nouesses both by see
and land / shall never fail of young men lacking experyence whom they may
alure in to their veyles and nets / and also disceyue. There be a great
nombre of fools and simple souls in every place. But I desire even with all
my heart / and I doubt not but so do all that be very good men / that the
religyon of the gospel should be so plesau^t to every man that they being
contented therewith / should not desire the relygyon of black monks of gray
freeres. And I doubt not but so would saint Benedicte and Fraunces them selves.
Al things give place to the glory of christ.
Moses did rejoice that his own honor was defaced and dymmed with the glory
of Christ: and so should those other be glad if for the love of Christ's law
we set nothing by man's constytucions. I would that all christen men should so
live that these which now be called only relygyous / should apere little
religyous / which thing even at this day is of truth and that in many: for
why should I dissymule that thing that is so manifest? The first beginning
of monks in old time.
And yet in the old time the beginning of the monasty call life was nothing
else but a going a side in to a secret place from the cruelnesse of ydolaters.
And anon after the manner of living of religyous men which followed the^ / was
nothing else but a reformacyon and calling again to Christ: for the courts of
princes in the old time showed them christened in their tytles / rather than
in their living. The bysshoppes anon after were corrupt with ambycion and
covetousness / and the comen people also faynted and woxen cold from y^
charity which was in y^ primytyue church: and for this purpose did saint
Benet seek a solytary life / and than after him Barnarde / and after that
diverse other did assocyat the^ selves together / for this intent only that
they might use the pure and simple life of christen men. Than after in process
of time when their richesse and cyremonyes did increase / their true
godliness and symplenesse did abate and decrease. From whence cyremonyes came.
And now although we se men of relygyon to be ouermoche out of good order /
and to use manners like unto gentyles / yet is the world filled with new
instytucions and kinds of relygyon as though they should not fall to the same
point here after that other have done before them. In times passed / as I said
/ a religyous life was nothing but a solytary life. And now these be called
religyous which be altogyder drowned in worldly Monks most worldly.
business / vsyng plainly certain tyranny in worldly matters / and yet these
for their aparayle and title I can not tell what / does challenge such
holiness to their selves that they do account all other in comparison of them
selves no christen men at all. why do we make so strayte and narowe christ's
relygyon which he would have so large? If we be moved with magnifycall and
high terms / I pray you what thing else is a cite but a great monastery? A
Cite is a great monasterye.
Monks be obedyent to their abbot and governors / the cytezyns obey the
bysshoppes and curates / whom Christ him self made rulers and not the
authorite of man. The monks live in idleness / and be fed of other men's
lyberalyte possessynge that amongst them in comen / which they never
labored or swet for (yet speak I nothing of them that be vycious). Obedience
/ pouerte / chastyte
The cytezyns bestow that which they have gotten with their labor and great
travail / to them that have need / every man as he is of habylyte and power.
Now as concerning the vow of chastyte I dare not be bold to express what
dyfference is bytwyxte the relygyous man unmarried / and the chaste matrymonye
of the other. And to be short he shall not very greatly lack those three vows
of man's inuencyon / that does keep and observe purely and syncerely y^
first only vow which we all solem^nly make unto Christ / and not unto manne
/ when we receive our baptysme. And if we compare those that be yuell of one
kind / with those that be yuel of the hother / without doubt the temperall men
be much better. But if we compare those which be good of the one sort with
those that be good of y^ other there is little dyfference / if there be any at
all / saving that those apere to be more relygyous that keep their religyon
and duty with less coactyon. The rest is therefore that no man folysshly
stand in his own conceyte / neither for his dyuersyte of living from other
men / nor dispyse or condemn the rule or order of other men's living. No
kind of life ought to be reproved.
But in every kind of living let this be our comen study / that every man
according to his power endeuoyre him self to attain unto the mark of Christ
/ which is set open to al men / and that every man do exhort other to it /
and also help other / neither enuyeng them y^ over ro^ne us in this course /
nor disdaynynge them that be weak and can not yet over take us. The co^fydence
in our self is most pernycions.
In conclusyon when every man has done that he can / let him not be like unto
the pharisey whom the gospel makes mencyon of / which does host his good
deeds unto god saying: I fast twyse in the weke / I pay al my tithes and such
forth. But after Christ's counsel let him speak from the heart and to him
self / and not to other / saying I am an unprofitable servant / for I have
done no more than I ought to do. There is no man that better trusts than he
that so dystrusteth. There is no man further from true religyon than he that
thinks him self to be very religyous. Nor Christ's godliness is never at
worse point / than when that thing which is wordly is writhen unto Christ /
and the authorite of man is preferred unto the authorite of god. we must all
hang of that heed if we will be true christen men. More over who so ever is
obedyent to a man which does persuade and call him unto Christ / he is
obedyent unto Christ / and not unto man. how far pr^lates must be obeyed.
And who so ever does tolerate and suffer those men which be subtyle /
cruel and ymperious / teaching that thing which makes not for religyon / but
for their tyranny / he uses the pacyence mete for a christen man / so that
these things which they command be not utterly wicked and contrary to
Christ's doctrine / for than it shall be convenient to have y^ answer of
thapostels at hand: we must rather be obedye^t unto god than to any mail. But
we have long ago passed the measure and quantyte of an epistle / so greatly y^
time disceyueth us / whiles we comen and talk most plesau^tly with our well be
loved friend. This book is sent unto you in Frobentus printe / as though it
were new borne again / much more ornate and better corrected than it was
before. I have put unto it certain fragmentes of mine old study in times
passed. Me thought it most couenyent to dedycate this edycion (such as it is)
unto you that who soever shall take any precepts to live well of Erasmus /
should have an example ready at hand of our father Uolzius. Our lord preserve
you good father / the honor and worship of all religyon. I pray you counsel
Sapidus that he be wise / that is / that he go forth as he has begone: and
to wynphelyngus ye shall speak also / that he prepare all his armure to fight
shortly with the turks / for as much as he has kept war long enough
with kepers of concubynes. And I have great hope and trust to se him ones a
bishop / and to ride upon a mule / and to be set high in honor with a mytre
and cross. But in ernest I pray you command me hertyly both unto them and
unto Ruserus and the rest of my friends / and in your devout prayers made to
god I pray you remember Erasmus / and pray for his souls health. At Basyle the

A compendyous treatise of the sowdyour of Christ / called Enchiridion / which
Erasmus of Roterdame wrote unto a certain courtyer / a friend of his.
THou have desired me with fervent study syngular beloved brother in Christ /
that I should descrybe for the compendyously / a certain craft of virtuous
lyui^g / by whose help thou myghtest attain a virtuous mind / according to a
true christen man. For thou say that thou are and have ben a great while
weary of the pastyme of the court. And do compass in thy mind by what
means thou myghtest escape egypt with all her both vices and pleasures / and
be prepared happyly with the captain Moses unto the journey of virtue. Egypt

The more I love the / the gladder I am of this thine so holy a purpose / which
I trust (ye without our help) he that has vouched safe to styre it up in the
/ shall make prosperous / and bring to good effect. The land of promyss syon
signyfyeth pure life.
Notwithstanding yet have I very gladly and wyllyngly accomplysshed thy desire
/ partly because thou art so great a friend of mine / partly also because thou
requyrest so charytable things. Now enforce thyself and do thine endeuoyre /
that neither thou may seem to have desired my service and duty i^vayne or else
I to have satisfied thy mind with out any fruit. ye let us both
indifferently beseech the benygne spirit of Jesus / that he both put holsom
things i^ my mind while I write and make the same to the of strength and
effycacye.

we must watch and look about us ever more while we be in this life. Caplo.j.
THe first point is / we must needs have in mind co^tynually / that the life
of mortal men is nothing but a certain perpetual exercise of war: as Job
witnesses. The life of man is but a warfare / says Job vi^.
A warry our proved to the uttermost and never ouerco^me. And y^ the most

flateri^g pleasures / which also as though they had conquered all their
enemies / make holydaye out of season / none otherwise verily than in a very
assured peace. Peace peace / and yet is there no peace at all
It is a meruaylous thing to behold how without care and circu^speccyon we live
/ how ydelly we sleep / now upon the one side / and now upon the other / when
without ceasyng we are beseged with so great a no^bre of armed vices / sought
and hu^ted for with so great craft / invaded daily with so great lyenge
awayte. Diverse enemies from above.
Behold over thy heed wicked deuyls that never sleep / but keep watch for our
destruction / armed against us with a thousand deceytes / with a thousand
crafts of noysau^ces / which enforce from on high to wound our minds with

Tha^ again on the right hand and on the left hand / before and behind this
world stryueth against us / which after the saying of saint John is set all
on vice and myschefe. And therefore to Christ both contrary and hated. Neither
is it one manner of fight / for sometime with go^nes of aduersite ragyng / as
with open war he shakes the walls of the soul Sometime with great
promesses(but yet most vain) he provoke to treason: and sometime by
vndermynynge he steleth on us unware to catch us among the idle and careless

This is our Eve by whom the most crafty serpent does entyce and draw our
minds to mortal and deedly pleasures. And forthermore as though it were but a
tryfle that so great a company of enemies should assawte us on every side. we
bear about with us where so ever we go in the very secret parts of y^ mind
an enemy nerer than one of acquaintance / or one of household. And as
nothing is more inward / so nothing is more peryllous. Old erthly Ada^
berokeneth appetytes or affeccyons
This is the old and erthly Adam / which by acquaintance and customable
familiarite / is more nere to us than a citezyn / and is in all manner studyes
and pastymes to us more contrary than any mortal ennemy / whom thou can
keep of with no bulwark / neither is it lawful to expel him out of thy
pauylyon. This fellow must be watched with an hundred eyes / lest perauenture
he set open the castle or cite of god for devils to enter in. Seeing therefore
we be vexed with so ferefull and cruel war / and that we have to do or strive
with so many enemies / which have co^spyred and sworn our death / which be
so besy / so appointed / so false and expert. Ought not we mad men on y^ other
side to arm our self and take our wepons in our hands to keep watch and
have all things suspect. But we as though al things were at rest and peace
sleep so fast that we rowte again and give our self to ydelnes / to pleasure /
and as the co^mue proverb is / give our minds to revelling and making good
chere / as though our life were a festyng or backettyng / such as the greeks
used / and not warfare. For in the stead of rentes and pauylyo^s we tumble and
walter in our beds. And in in the stead of salle^tes and hard armure we be
crowned with roses and fresshe flowers. Bathed in damask and rose waters /
smoked in pomaunders and with musk balls / chaungyng points of war with
riot and ydelnes. And in ye stead of wepo^s belo^gyng to ye war / we handle
and take unto us the vnhardy harp / as this peace were not of all wars the
most shameful. For who so ever is at one with vices / has broken truce made
between him and god in time of baptym. And thou oh mad man cryest peace peace
/ wha^ thou have god thine ennemy / which only is peace and the author of
peace / and he himself with open mouth cries the contrary by the mouth of
his prophet / saying there is no peace to sinners or wicked persons which
love not god. There is no peace to wicked persons.
And there is none other condition of peace with him except that we (as long
as we war in the fortress of this body) with deedly hate and with all our
might should fight against vices. For if we be at one with the^ / we shall have
him twyse our ennemy / which only being our friend may make us blissed. And if
he be our foo may destroy us / both because that we stand on their side
which only can never agree with god / for how can light and darkness agree /
and also that because we as men most unkind abide not by the promise that we
made to him / but unjustly have broken thappoyntme^t made between him and us
with protestacion and holy ceremonies. In time of baptym we profess with
protestacion ^o fight ever under the standarde of Christ.
Oh thou christen man remembrest thou not when thou were professed and
consecrate with the holy mysteryes of ye fountain of life / how thou boundest
thy self to be a faithful sowdyour unto thy captain Christ / to whom thou
owe thy life twyse / both because he gave it the / and also because he
restored it again to the / to whom thou owe more than thou art able to pay.
Comes it not to thy mind how when thou were bound with his sacraments as
with holy gifts / thou were sworn with words for the nones to take the part
of so curteys an Emperor / and that thou dydest curse and banne thine own
heed / desiring vengeance to fall upon thine own self / if thou dydest not
abide by thy promise. Badges and signs of baptym.
For what intent was the sign of the cross prynted in thy foreheed / but that
as long as thou lyuest thou sholdest fight under his standarde. For what intent
were thou anointed with his holy oil / but that thou for ever sholdest wrestle
and fight against vices. what shame and how great abomynacyon is it accounted
with all men if a man forsake his king or chief lord. why set thou so
light than by thy capytayne Christ / neither kept down with the fear of him
/ seeing he is god / nor refraynynge for love / seeing for thy sake he was made
man / ye and seeing thou vsurpest his name thou ought to remember what thou
have promised him. The name of Christ ought to put us in remembrance.
why departest thou away from him like a false forsworn man / and go unto
thine ennemy / from whens he ones redeemed the with the rau^som of his precious
blood. why do thou so often a renegate war and fight under the standarde of
his adversary. with what face sumest thou to set up contrary baners against thy
king which for thy sake bestowed his own life. who so ever is not on his part
/ as he says himself Luce. xj. stands against him. And he that gadereth not
with him scatereth abroad. Thou warrest not only with fylthy title or quarrel
/ but also for a miserable reward. wylt thou hear who so ever thou be y^ art
servant or sowdyour to the world / what shall be thy mede / Paul the
standarde bearer in the war of Christ answers the. The reward (says he)
of sin is death. The guerdon of (...).
And who would take upon him to fight in a just and an honest cause: if he were
sure to dye but bodily only / and thou fyghtest in a wrong and also a filthy
quarrel to obtain for thy reward the death of thy soul. In these mad wars
that man makes against man / either through beestly fury / or for miserable
necessite. See thou not if at any time the greatness of y^ pray promised or
hoped for / or comfort of the captain / or the cruelnes of the enemies / or
shame of cowardnes cast in their tethes / or in co^clusyon if desire of praise
has prycked and stered up the sowdyours minds: with what courage and with
what lusty stomachs fynysshe they what so ever labor remains / how little
they regard their lives / with how great fyersnes run they upon their
enemies / well is him that may go formest. And I beseech the now small is y^

which those wretched men go aboure to get with so great ieopardyes and
diligence Ueryly but to have praise of a wretched man their captayn / and that
they might be praised with a rude and homely song / such as are used to be
made in ye time of war to have happily their names written in a harpers
bederoll / to get a garlande of grass or oken leaves / or at y^ most to bring
home a little more vau^tage or wynnyng with them. we on the other side clean
contrary be kendled neither with shame nor hope of reward / and yet he
beholds us while we fight that shall quyte our pain if we win the field.
But what reward sets forth the chief ruler of our game for them that win the maystry / not mules as Achylles did in Homere / not tripodas / that is to
say / meat bordes with. iij. fete / as Eneas did in Uirgil: but such as the
eye never saw / ne ye ear never herd / neither could synke in to the heart of
man. And these rewards he gives in y^ mean season to his (whiles they be yet
fyghting) as solaces and things to comfort them in their labors and
trauayles. And what here after? certes blessed i^mortalite. But in games of
sport / as rennyng / wrastlyng / lepyng / in which ye chefest part of
reward is praise. They which be ouerco^me / have likewise their rewards
assygned unto them. But our matter is tried with great and doutfull peril /
neither we fight for praise / but for life / and as reward of most valor is
profred to him that quyteth him self most manfully. So pain most terryble is
appointed for him y^ gives back. Heaven is promised to him that fyghteth
lustely. And why is not the quick courage of a gentle stomach enflamed with
the hope of so blessed a reward / namely wha^ he promyseth / which as he can
not dye / even so he can not deceive. All things be done in the sight of god
which al things beholds. God beholds us.
we have all the company of heaven beholders of our conflict. And how are we not
moved at the lestway even for very shame? He shall praise our virtue and
diligence / of whom to be landed is very felicite. why seek we not this praise
/ ye with the loss of our lives. It is a cowardfull mind that will be
quickened with no manner of reward. The veryest hertles cowarde in the world /
for fear of peryls often time takes courage to him. And in worldly bataylles
though thine adversary be never so cruel / yet rages he but on thy goods and
body only. what more tha^ that could cruel Achylles do to Hector. Achilles
slew hector.
But here the imortall part of the is assawted and thy carkas is not drawn
about the sepulcre as Hectors / but thy body and soul is cast down in to
hell: there the greatest calamite or hurt is / that a sword shall separate the
soul from the body. Here is taken from thy soul the life / which is god him
self. It is natural for the body to dye which if no man kill / yet must it
nedely dye. But thy soul to dye / is extreme mysery. with how great cawtell
void we the wou^des of the body / with how great diligence cure we them / and
set we so little of the wou^des of the soul. The death of the body seems
terryble / the death of the soul is not perceived.
Our hertes aryseth and grudgeth at the remembrance of death of the body as a
terrible or outragyous thing / because it is seen with bodyly eyes. The soul
to dye because no man sees and sewe byleueth / therefore very few fear it.
And is this death more cruel yet than the other. Even as much as the soul
does pass the body / and god excels the soul. Wylt thou that I show the
cerceyn conjectures / examples or tokens whereby thou may perceive the sickness
and death of the soul? The token of a sick soul.
Thy stomach dygesteth ill / it keeps no meat / thou perceyuest by and by
thy body to be out of temper. And bread is not so natural meat to thy body /
as the word of god is meat for thy soul. if that seem bitter / if thy mind
rise against it / why dourest thou yet but yt the mouth of thy soul is out of
taste / and infected with some disease. if thy memory the stomach of thy soul
keep not the learning of god. if by co^tynual meditacyon thou digestest not. if
when it is dygested / thou sendest it not to all parts by operacyon / thou
have an euyde^t token that thy soul is acrased. when thy knees for weyknes bow
under the / and much work to draw thy lymmes after the / thou perceyuest
plainly thy body to be evil at ease. And do thou not perceive the sycknes
of thy soul when he grudgeth and is weyke and faynte to all deeds of pite /
when he has no strength to suffer pacyently the leest rebuke in the world /
and is troubled and angry with the loss of a halfpeny. After that the sight is
departed fro the eyes / and the ears cease to hear. After that all the body
has lost his felyng: no man douteth than but the soul is departed. when the
eyes of thy heart be waxen dym / in so much that thou can not se the most
clerest light / which is virtue or troth. wha^ thou hear not with thy
inward ears the voice of god. when thou lackest all thy inward feeling and
perceiving of the knowledge of god / thynkest thou that thy soul is alive.
Thou see thy brother ungoodly entreated / thy mind is nothing moved so thy
matter be in good case. why feleth thy soul nothing here? Certainly because he
is deed. why deed? because her life is away / that is god For verily where god
God is life of the soul.
is / there is charity / love and co^passyo^ of thy neighbor / for god is that
charity. For if thou were a quycke membre / how could any part of thy body ache
/ thou not sorowynge / no not ones felyng or perceyuyng it. Felyng is a token
of life.
Take a more euyde^t toke^. Thou have deceived thy friend / thou have committed
adultery / thy soul has ^aught a deedly wound / and yet it greueth the not /
in so much that thou ioyest as it it were of great wynnyng / and bostest thy
self of that thou shamefully have committed. believe surely that thy soul
lies deed Thy body is not alive if he feel not the pryckyng of a pyn. And is
thy soul alive which lacks the feeling of so great a wound. Thou hear
some man use lewd and presumptuous co^muny cacyon / words of backbytyng /
unchaste and fylthy / ragyng furyously against his neighbor: think not the
soul of yt man to be alive. There lies a rotten carkas in ye sepulcre of that
stomach fro whens such stenche aryseth and infecteth every man that comes
nygh. Christ called the pharisees painted sepulcres. why so? because they bare
deed souls about with them. And king David the prophet says / their throat
is a sepulcre wide open / they spoke deceytfully with their tongues. The bodies
of holy people be the temples of the holy ghost. The bodies of good men be the
temples of the holy ghost.
And lewd men's bodies be the sepulcres of deed corses / that the
interpretacions of the gra^maryens to them might well be applied Soma quasi
Sima. The body is the buryal or grave.
it is called a body because it is the buryall / that is to say / the grave of
the soul. The breast is ye sepulcre / the mouth and the throat is the gapynge
of the sepulcre / and the body destytute of the soul / is not so deed as is
the soul when she is forsaken of almighty god / neither any corse stynketh
i^the nose of man so sore as the stenche of a soul buried. iiij. days
offends the nose of god and all saints. Therefore conclude when so ever deed
words proceed out of thy heart / it must needs be that a deed corse lies
buried within. For when (according to the gospel) the mouth speaks of the
abundance of the heart / no doubt he would speak the lively words of god /
if there were life present / that is to wit god. In an other place of the
gospel the dyscyples say to Christ. Master whether shall we go / thou have
the words of life? why so I pray the the words of life? Certeynly for
because they spronge out of the soul from whom the godhede which restored us
again to life immortal never departed not yet one moment. The phisicyan eases
thy body sometime wha^ thou art diseased. Good and holy men somtymes have called
the body deed to life again. But a deed soul nothing but god only of his fre
and syngular power restores to life again / ye and he restores her not
again if she being deed have ones forsaken the body. More over of the bodyly
death is the felyng little or none at all. But of the soul / is the felyng
eternal And though also the soul in that case be more tha^ deed / yet as
touching the felyng of eternal death / she is ever i^mortal. Therefore seeing we
must needs fight with so strange and meruayllous ieopardye / what dulnes /
what necligence / what folyshnes is that of our mind / whom fear of so great
myschef sharpeneth not. Many causes why a chryste^ man ought to be of good
conforte / and to have confydence.
And again on the contrary perte there is no cause wherefore either the greatness
of peril / or else the multitude / the violence / the subtilte of thine
adversaries should abate the courage of ye mind. It comes to thy mind how
grievous an adversary thou have. Remember also on the other side how p^sent how
ready at hand thou have help and socour. Against the be innumerable / ye but
he that takes thy part / himself alone is more of power than all they. if god
be on our side / what matter is it who be against us. if he stay the / who shall
cast y^ down. But thou must be enflamed in all thy heart and brenne in fervent
desire of victory. Let it come to thy remembrance that thou stryuest not / nor
have not to do with a fresshe sowdyour and a new adversary / but with him that
was many years ago Our ennemy was ouercom many years ago^e.
disco^fyted overthrown / spoiled and led captyue in triumph of us / but
than in Christ our heed / by whose might no doubt he shall be subdued again
in us also. Take heed therefore that thou be a member of the body and thou shall
be able to do all things in the power of ye heed. No man is strong in his
own strength.
In thy self thou art very weyke / in him thou art valiant / and nothing is
there that thou art not able to do. wherefore the end of our war is not
doutfull / because the victory depends not of fortune / but is put holly in
ye hands of god / and by him in our hands. No man is here that has not
ouerco^me / but he that would not. The benignite of our protector never failed
man. If thou take heed to answer and to do thy part again / thou art sure of
the victory / for he shall fight for the / and his liberalite shall be imputed
to the for merit. Thou must thank him all together for the victory / which
first of all himself alone being immaculate / pure and clean from sin /
oppressed the tyranny of sin. But this victori shall not com with out thine
own diligence also / for he that said / have confydence. I have ouerco^men the
world / would have the to be of a good comfort / but not careless and neclige^t.
On this manner in conclusyon in his strength / and by him we shall ouerco^me. if
by his ensample we shall fight as he fought / wherefore thou must so keep a
mean course / as it were between Scilla Scilla is a (...) pardons place in the sea of ce^ cyle.

/ y^ neither trustyng to much and bearyng the over bold upon the grace of
god thou be careless and recheles / neither yet so mystrustyng in thy self /
feared with the difficulti^s of the war / do cast from the courage / boldness
/ or co^fydence of mind together with harneys and wepons also.

Of the wepons to be used in the war of a christen man. Ca.ij.
ANd I suppose that nothing perteyneth so much to the dyscyplyne of this
war than that thou surely know and presently have recorded and exercysed in
thy mind always with what kind of armure or wepo^s thou ought to fight /
and against what enemies thou must encounter and just. More over that thy
wepo^s be always ready at hand / lest thine so subtyle an ennemy should take the
sleper and unarmed. In these worldly wars a man may be often times at rest /
as in the deep of the winter / or in time of truce: but we as long as we keep
war in this body / may depart from our harneys and wepons no season / no not
as the saying is one finger bread. A christen man should never cease from war.
we must ever stand before the tents and make watch / for our adversary is
never idle: but wha^ he is most calm and still / when he fayneth to flee or to
make truce / even than most of al he ymagineth gyle: and thou have never more
need to keep watch than wha^ he makes cou^tenau^ce or semblaunce of peace.
Thou have never less need to fear than wha^ he assaulteth the with open
war. Therefore let thy first care be that thy mind be not unarmed. we arm
our body because we would have no need to fear the dagger or preuy murderer of
the thief. Shall we not arm our mind likewise / that he might be in save
guard? Our enemies be armed to destroy ^s / does it grieve us to take out
wepons of defense yt we perysh not? They watch to kill / shall not we watch
to be out of danger? But of the armure and wepons of a christen man we shall
make specyal mencyon when we come to the places conuenye^t. In the mean
season to speak breuely who so ever will assail with battle the seven nacyo^s

that be called / Cananei / Cethei / Amorrei / Pherezei / Gergezei / Euei / and
Iebuzei / that is to say / who so ever will take upon him to fight against the
hole host of vices / of the which seven be counted as chief captains / must
provide him of two special wepons. Prayer and knowledge Prayer and knowledge be
the chief armure of a christen man.
/ otherwise called learning. Paul would we should be ever armed / which
byddeth us pray continually without stop. Prayer pure and perfyte lyfteth up
thine affection to heaven / a toure beyond thine enemies reche. Learning or
knowledge fenseth or armeth the mind with holsom precepts and honest opinyons
/ and puts the ever in remembrance of virtue / so that neither can be
lackyng to ye other. These twain cleueth so together like friends / the one
ever requyryng the others help. The one makes intercessyon and prays. The
other shows what is to be desired and what thou ought to pray. To pray
^erue^tly / and (as James exhorts us) without doutyng or mystrustyng faith
and hope brings to pass. To pray in the name of Jesus / which is nothing
else but to desire things holsom for thy soul health only / lernyng or
doctrine techeth the. Said not Christ to the sons of zebedei. The sons of
zebedei be James the more and John^ the evangelist.
ye know not what ye ask? But prayer verily is the more excellent / as she
that comes and talks familiarly with almighty god. yet for all that is
doctrine no less necessary. And I can not tell whether that thou fled from
Egypt myghtest without great ieopardy commit thyselfe to so long a journey so
hard and full of diffyculte / without the capteyns Aaron and Moses. Aaron
signyfyeth prayer Moses betokens knowledge.
Aaron which was charged with things dedycate to the service of gods temple /
betokens prayer. By Moses is fygured the knowledge of the law of god. And as
knowledge of god ought not to be imperfect / so prayer should not be faint /
slack / without courage or quycknes. Moses with the wepons of prayer fought
against his enemies / but had his hands lyfted up to heaven / which when he
let down / the israelites had the worse. Thou happily when thou prayest
^syderest only how much of thy psalms thou have mombled up / and thynkest
much bablyng to be the strength and virtue of prayer: which is chefely the
vice of them which (as infantes) cleue to the lytterall sense / and are not
yet grown up to the rypenes of the spirit. But hear what Christ techeth us
in Mathewe / saying. when ye pray speak not much / as the ethneys and
gentyles do / for they think their prayers to be accepted because of much
bablyng. Counterfayte them not therefore / for your father knows whereof ye
have need before ye desire it of him. And Paul to the Corynthes despyseth. x.
thousand words babled with mouth in co^paryson of five spoken in knowledge.
Moses opened not his lyppes / and yet god said to him. why cryest thou so to
me. It is not the noise of thy lyppes / but the fervent desire of thy mind /
which (as it were a very shyrle voice) beats the ears of god. Let this
therefore be a customable thing with the that as soon as thine enemy aryseth
against the / and the vices which thou have forsaken trouble the / thou than
with out tarying with sure co^fydence and trust lift up thy mind to heaven /
from whens help shall come to the / and thither also lift up thy hands. The
surest thing of all is to be occupied in deeds of pite Pite is not taken for
co^passyo^ but for the honoring and worshyppynge of god with charity or love
ordynate / as Christ taught us to love.
/ that thy deeds may be referred and applied / not to worldly busynes / but
unto Christ. yet lest thou sholdest despise the help of knowledge / consider
one thing. Before time it was enough for the israelytes to flee and escape
from their enemies / but they were never so bold as to provoke the
Amalachytes / and to try with them hand for hand before they were refresshed
with ma^na from heaven / and water rennynge out of the hard rock. Manns is a
honey dew wherewith the children of israel were fed. xl. years / and it is

Believe me well brother syngularly beloved in my heart / there is none so great
violence of thy foes / that is to say / none so great temptacion which
fervent study or meditacyo^ of holy scripture is not able to put abacke / nor
any so grievous aduersite which it makes not easy. And lest I should seem to be
somewhat to bold an interpretour (though I could defend my self with great
authorite) what thing I pray the could more properly have signified the
knowledge of the secret law of god than did ma^na. For first in that it
sprange not out of ye earth / but rayned down from heaven. By this properte thou
perceyuest the difference between the doctrine of god and the doctrine of man.
For all holy scripture came by dyuyne inspiracyon and from god the author. In
that it is small or little in quantite / is signified the humilite / lowlynes or
homelynes of the style under rude words includi^g great mystery. That it is
white by this properte is signyfyed the puryte and clennes of gods law. For
there is no doctrine of man which is not defiled with some black spot of
error / only the doctrine of Christ every where bright / every where pure and
clean. That it is somewhat hard and some deal rough and sharp / betokens
secret mysteryes hid in the litteral sense. if thou handle the utter side
and if I may so call it the codde / what is more hard or unsavory. They tasted
but the utter rynde of manna / which said to Christ / this is a hard saying /
and who may abide ye hearing thereof. But get out the spiritual sense / and
nothing is more sweter nor more full of pleasure and sweet iuce. More over
manna is in the ebrewe tongue as much to say as what is this? which questyon
agrees well to holy scripture / which has nothing i^ it idle or in vain no
not one title or prick / unworthy to be serched / unworthy to be pondered /
unworthy of this saying / what is this? It is a common use unto the holy ghost
to signyfye by water the knowledge of the law of god Thou redest of y^ water of

of y^ waters which wysdom co^ueyeth in to the tops of every way: thou

wade over: thou redest of the wells that Abraham dug / which when they
were stopped of the philistiens ysaac repared again. Thou redest of.xij.
fou^taynes at which ye israelytes after they had walked through. xl. mansions /
and began than to be weary and faint / rested and refresshed themself and made

to rehearse all places in this significacyon / often mention is made in scripture
of wells fountaynes and ryuers / by which is signyfied nothing else but that
we ought to inquire and search diligently for the mysteryes hid in scripture.
what signyfyeth water hid in y^ veins of the earth but mystery covered or hyd
in the litterall sense. what means the same conveyed abroad bu^ mystery
opened and expouned. which being spread and dilated both wide and broad / to
the edyfying of y^ hearers / what cause is there why it might not be called a
river. wherefore if thou dedycate thy self holly to the study of scripture and
exercise thy mind day and night in y^ law of god / no fear shall trouble the
/ neither by day nor night: but thou shalt against all assawtes of thine
enemies he armed and exercysed also. And I disalowe it not utterly if a man
for a sea son (to begin withal) do exercise and sport himself in works of
poets and philosophers which were ge^tyles / as i^ his A b c. or introductory
to a more perfyte thing / so that he taste of them measurably / and whiles

not abide and tarry upon them still / and to wexe old and dye in them / as he

Basilius to such pastyme exhorts young men / whom he himself had induced to
the conversation of christen men. And our Augustyn calls back again his
friend Lice^tius to pass the time with the muses / neither Ierom repents him
self that he has loved a woman taken prisoner in war. Cyprian is commended
because he garnysshed the temple of god with the spoils of the Egipcia^s. But
in no case would I that thou with the gentyles learning sholdest also souke the
gentyles vices and conuersacyon. For if thou do not / thou shalt find many
things helpyng to honest living / neither is it to be refused what so ever an
author (ye though he be a gentyle) techeth well. For Moses verily though he
were never so famylyar with god / yet despised he not the counseyle of his
father in law Ietro. Those scyences fascyon and quycken a chyldes wit / and
makes him apt before hand meruaylously to the understanding of holy
scripture. whereunto suddenly and irreuere^tly to presume with hands and fete
vnwasshed / is in manner a certain kind of sacrilege. And Ierom checketh ye
shameless pertnes of them which streyghtwaye from secular or worldly seyence
dare take in hand to meddle or interpret holy scripture. But how much
shamefuller do they which never tasted other science / and yet at the first
dare do the same thing. But as the scripture is not much fruitful if thou
stand and stycke still in the lettre. In like manner the poetry of Homere and
Uirgyl shall not profit a little / if thou remember that it must be
understand in the sense allegory / which thing no man will deny that has
assayed or tasted of the lernyng of old antiquitees never so little / ye with
the typ of his tongue / or uttermost part of his lyppes. As for the poets
which write uncleanly / I would counseyle the not ones to touch them / or at
the leest way not to look far in them: except thou can the better abhor
vices when they be descrybed to the / and in co^paracions of fylthy things the
more fervently love things honest. Of the philosophers my mind is that thou
follow them that were of Platoes sect / because both in very many sentences /
and much more in their style and manner of speaking / they come very nygh to
the figure and propertye of speech used of the prophets and i^ the gospelles.
And to make an end shortly / it shall be profitable to taste of al manner of
learning of the gentyles / if it so be done as I showed before / both i^ years
according and measurably / more over with cautele and judgment discretly /
farthermore with speed and after the manner of a man that entendeth but to pass
over ye country only and not to dwell or inhabyte in co^clusyon (which thing
is chefest of all) if every thing be applied and referred to Christ For so all
shall be clean to them yt be clean when on the other side to them that be
unclean nothing is clean. And it shall be no rebuke to the / if after the
ensample of Solomon thou nourysshe up at home in thy house. lx. queen's. lxxx.
souereyn ladies and damoysels innumerable of secular wisdom. As Solomon had
lx. queen's lxxx. co^cubines and damoyselles innumerable / yet one chief queen /
whom all the rest honored. so may we of all sciences have authors inumerable
/ if holy scripture be chief of all other for the honesting of her.
So that the wisdom of god be above al other / thy best beloved / thy dove /
thy sweet heart / which only seems beautefull. And an israelyte loves a
stranger and a barbarous damsel / ouerco^me with her beauty: but first he
shaueth of her hear and pareth her nails / and makes her of an alyen an
israelyte. The israelyte might take to wife a stranger taken in war so that
her nails were first pared and her hear sha^en: So may chryste^ men honor
god with ge^tyles lernyng / if we cut of that is superfluous.
And the prophet Ozee married an harlot / and of her had children not for
himself / but for y^ lord of sabbath and the holy fornycacyon of the prophet
augmented the household of god. The ebrewes after they had forsaken Egypt lived
with light and pure white bread The light and pure white breed betokens the
gentiles living. Ma^na betokens the wysdom of god.
for a season / but it was not sufficye^t to so great a journey. Therefore that
bread lothed at ones / thou must make as good speed as can be unto manna of
celestial wisdom the which shall nourysshe the habou^dau^tly and strength
the until thou obtain thy purpose / and win by victory the reward that
never shall cease: but thou must ever remember in the mean season yt holy
scripture may not be touched but with clean and wasshen hands / that is to
understand / but with high pureness of mind / lest that which of it self is
a p^seruatyue or tryacle / by thine own fault turn to y^ in to poison / and
lest manna to the begin to putryfye / except yt thou convey or send it in to
the inward parts of thy mind and affection / and leest happyly it should
fortune to the as it did to Oza / which feared not to set to his profane and
unclean hands to the Ark of god enclynynge on ye one side and with sodeyn
death was punysshed for his lewd service. David ent^^ded to translate the ark
of god out of the house of Amynadab which was in Gaboa / they put the ark upon
a carte / Oza with his brethren waited on it on either side / a^ the arc
enclyned and bowed Oza set his hand to stay it and was s^ytten with sodeyne
death for his presumpcyon.
The first point is that thou have good opinyon of the holy scriptures / and
that thou esteem them of no less valor and dignite than they are worthy to be
esteemed / and that they came out of the secret closet of the mind of god.
Scriptur must be had in great reverence.
Thou shall perceive that thou art inspired of god moved inwardly / rapt and in
an unspeakable manner altered and changed to an other manner figure or shappe /
if thou shalt come religiously / if with reverence and mekely thou shalt se
the pleasures / delycates / or deynties of the blessed spouse. Thou shall se
the precious iowels of rich Salomo^ / thou shall se ye secret treasure of
eternal wysdom: but beware that thou break not malepertly in to the secret
closet / the door is low / beware leest thou stryke the door with thy heed /
and be feign to lepe back again. Think on this wise nothing that thou see
with thine eyes / nothing that thou ha^dlest with thy fyngers to be i^dede the
same thing which it appears / so surely as these things be true i^ holy
scripture: Faith must be given to holy scripture.
so yt if heaven and earth should perysshe / yet of y^ words of god not one jot
or title shall perysh / but al shall be fulfilled. Though men lie / though men
err / yet the verite of god neither deceyueth nor is deceived. Of the
i^terp^tours of scripture The chief interp^tours of holy scripture.

divines of later time slycke very much in ye lettre / and with good will give
more study to subtyle and deceytfull arguments / than to search out y^
mysteryes / as though Paul has not said truly our law to be spu^all. I have
herd some men my self which stood so greatly in their own co^ceyte with the
fantastical tradicyo^s / ymaginacyo^s and inuencyons of man / y^ they despised

gave them such co^fyde^ce that notwithsta^di^g they never ones read the holy
scripture / yet thought they them self to be perfyte diuynes / which persons
though they speak things never so crafty and subtle / yet whether they speak
things worthy of y^ holy ghost and the meke spirit of Christ or not / let
other men judge. But if thou had lever to be somewhat lusty and quick of
spirit / tha^ to be armed to contencio^ / that is to say / to brawlyng or
scolding. if thou seek rather to have thy soul made fat / tha^ thy wit to be
vaynly delyted: study and read over chiefly y^ old doctors and expositours /
whose godlynes and holy life is more proved and known / whose religion to god
is more to be po^dered and looked upon whose lerni^g is more ple^teous and sage
also whose style is neither bare ne rude and i^terp^tacio^ more agreeable to y^
holy mysteryes And I say not this because I despise these new diuynes / but
because I set more by things more profitable and more apt for the purpose. The
sp^kynge of scripture.
And also the spiryt of god has a certain tongue or speech appropriate to him
self / he has his fygures similitudes / parables / co^pariso^s / proverbs

so to vanysshe away / but that they continue all their life and wexe old in
the lettre and never enforce to come to the spiritual knowledge of scripture /
neither hear they Christ cryeng in ye gospel / the flesh / that is to say /
the lettre / or that ye se outward profyteth not at al. The flesh is called
in scripture what so ever is visible or perceived outward with any sensyble
power.
It is the spirit within that quickens or gives life. They hear not Paul
affermyng with his master / yt the lettre kylleth / and it is the spirit
gives life. And again we know (says he) that the law is spiritual / and not
carnal. Spiritual things must be compared with spiritual things. The spiryt
is called what so ever is pceyued inwardly with the eye of the soul.
In time passed the father of al spiritual gifts would be honored in the
mounteyn / but now he will be honored in the spirit. How be it I despise not
the feebleness of them / which for lack of knowledge and understanding does y^
they only be able to do / pronouncing the mystical psalms with pure faith
without dissimulacyon or ypocrysye / but rather as in charms and
enchauntementes of magyke certain words not understand / no not of them
which pronounce them yet be byleued to be of virtue and strength. A
similitude of mekenes of them which lack capaci^te.
Even so the words of god / though they be not perfytly understand /
nevertheless we must trust that they be profitable to them that either say
them or hear them with perfyte faith / with pure affection and mind And that
the angels which are present and does understand be provoked to help them.
And Paul despyseth not them which say psalms with their mouth which
speaks with tongues that thing they understand not: but he exhorts them to
leave their infancy / and to follow more perfyte gifts / unto which if a man
can not attain / not through the defaute of a corrupt mind / but for lack
of capacite: let him not bark against them which enforce better things. And
after the precept of Paul / let not him which eats / despise him which
eats not / neither he that eats not / judge him that eats. Nevertheless
I will not have the which art endewed with so happy a wit to be slow and to
tarry long in the bareyn lettre / but to make speed unto more secret mysteryes

destroy fortresses and cou^seyles / and every high thing that exalts himself

which thou may resyst in a woeful day. Thou shall find the harneys of
justice on the right hand / and on the left thou shalt find the defense of
thy sides verite / and the hawbergyon of justice the bukler of faith / wherewith
thou may quench all the hot and fyery wepons of thy cruel aduersarye. Thou
shalt find also the helmet of health and the sword of the spirit / which
is the word of god / with the which al if a man shall be dilygently covered
and fensed / he may boldly without fear bring forth the bold saying of
Paul. who shall separate us from the love of god? shall tribulacyon? shall
straytnes or difficulty? shall hunger? shall nakedness? shall peril? shall
persecucyon? shall a sword. Behold how mighty enemies and how much feared
of all men he sets at naught. But hear also a certain greater thing / for
it follows. But in all things we have ouerco^me by his help which loved us.
And I am assured (says he) that neither death nor life / nor angels / neither
principates / neither virtutes / neither present things / neither things to
come / neither strength / neither hyghnes / neither lownes / nor none other
creature shall or may separate us from the love of god which is in Christ
Jesus. O happy trust and confydence which the wepons or armure of light gives
to Paul / that is by interpretacyon a little man / which calls himself the
refuse or outcast of the world. Of such armure therefore haboundau^tly shall
holy scripture mynyster to the / if thou will occupye thy time in it with all
thy might: so that thou shall not need our counseyle or admonycyons.
Nevertheless seeing it is thy mind / leest I should seem not to have obeyed
thy request / I have forged for the this little treatise called Enchiridion /
that is to say / a certain little dagger / whom never lay out of thy hand /
no not when thou art at meat / or in thy chaumbre. In so much that if at any
time thou shalt be compelled to make a pilgrimage in these worldly occupacyons
/ and shalt be accombred to bear about with the the hole and complete armure
and harneys of holy scripture / yet committee not that the suttellyer in wait
at any season should come upon the and find the utterly unarmed / but at the
leest let it not grieve the to have with the this little hanger / which shall
not be heavy to bear / nor unprofitable for thy defense / for it is very little
/ yet if thou use it wisely / and couple with it the bukler of faith / thou
shalt be able to withstand the fyerse and ragyng assawte of thine ennemy: so
that thou shall have no deedly wound. But now it is time that I begin to give
the a certain rule of the use of these wepons / which if thou shall put in
execucyo^ or practyse / I trust it will come to pass that our capytayne Jesus
Christ shall translate the a co^querour out of this little castle or garryson in
to his great cite Jerusalem with triumph / where is no rage at al of any
battle / but eternal quietness / perfyte peace / assured tranquillite: but
where as in the mean season al hope and confydence of saufgarde is put in
armure and wepon.

That the first point of wisdom is to know thy self / and of two manner
wysdomes / the true wisdom / and the appare^t. Ca.iij.
THat excellent good thing desired and sought for of all men / is peace or
quietness: unto which ye lovers of this world also refer all their study /
but they seek a false peace / and shote at a wrong mark. The same peace the
philosophers also promised unto the folowers of their conclusions / but yet
falsely / for Christ only gives it / the world gives it not. A man must
fight agynst himself.
To come to this quietness / the only way or means is (if we make war)
against our self / if we fight strongly against our own vices / for with these
enemies god which is our peace God is our peace and felicite
is at varyau^ce with deedly hate / seeing he is naturally virtue it self and
father and lord of al virtue. Stoici were phylosofers as Socrates and Plato /
with their folowers which put felicyte in true pleasure in virtue only and
within the conscience without any outward pleasure or riches.
And where as a filthy puddle or a synke gathered togider of al kind of vices
/ is named of the stoikes which are the most fervent deferders of virtue
folyshnes / and in our scripture the same is called malice / in like manner
virtue or goodness lackyng in no point / of both parts is called wysdom. But
after the saying of the wise man does not wysdom ouerco^me malice? The father
and heed of malice is the ruler of darkness belial: whose steps who so ever
follows walks in ye night and shall come to eternal night. Folyshnes is
myserye. wisdom is felycyte. Fools also be wretches and unhappy. wise men
also be happy and fortunate. Fylthynes is folyshnes virtue is wisdom.
On the other side ye ground of wysdom and in deed wisdom it self is Christ
Jesus / which is very light and the bryghtnes of the glory of his father /
putrynge away by himself only ye night of y^ folyshnes of the world The
which (wytnessynge Paul) as he was made redempcyon and iustificacyon to us
that be borne again in him. Even like wise was made also our wisdom. we (says
Paul) preche Christ crucified / which to the jews is an occasion of unite /
and to the ge^tyles folyshnes. But to ye elected both of the jews and also of
ye gentiles we preche Christ the virtue or strength of god / and the wysdom of
god / by whose wysdom through his ensample we may bear away the victory of our
ennemy malice / if we shall be wise in him in whom also we shall be conquerours.
Make much of this wysdom and take her in thine arms worldly wysdom worldly
wisdom is very folysshnes
set at naught / which with false title and under a feigned color of honest
bosteth and shows her self gay to fools / wha^ after Paul there is no
greater folyshnes with god than worldly wysdom / a thing that must be forgete
in deed again of him that will be wise in deed. ^e must be a fool in this
world that will be wise in god.
If any man (says Paul) among you seems to be wise in this world / let
him be a fool yt he may be wise / for the wisdom of this world is folyshnes
with god. And a little before Paul says it is written? I will destroy the
wysdom of wise men / and the prudence of prudent men I will reprove. where is
the wise man / where is ye subtle lawyer / where is the sercher The serchers
were the phylosofers which serched for worldly wysdo^ yet could they attayn no
wisdom to save the soul of man until Christ came.
of this world. Has not god made the wysdom of this world folyshnes. And I
doubt not but even now with great hate these folysshe wise men ^arke against
the / and these blind capteyns or guydes of blind men cry out and rore
against the / saying that thou art deceived / that thou dotest and art mad
as a bedlem man / because thou ente^dest to depart unto Chrystwarde. Many be
christen men in name only but the very christen me^ be they which keep and
ob^ue i^wardly Christ's precepts.
These be in name only christen men / but in very deed they are both mockers
and also enemies of Christ's doctrine. A true chryste^ man must despise the
folishnes of worldly me^.
Take heed and beware that their folysshe babbling move the not / whose
miserable blyndnes ought rather to be wept / sorowed and mourned than to be
counterfeyted or followed. he is good for nothing says hesiodus which neither
has wysdo^ / nor yet will learn it.
Oh what folysshe kind of wysdom and clean out of order is this in tryfles and
things of no value / ye to fylthynes only to be clear wytted / ware and
expert: To have knolege is best of all. To be willing to learn and obedyente
to the truth is also a good thing To lack knolege is a very evil thing.
but in those things which only make for our sauegarde or health: To disdayn
to learn is worse but to withsto^de and repugne against the truth to them
which teach the truth is worst of al and fardest from grace.
not to have much more understanding than a brute be. Paul would we
should be wise but in goodness / and children in evil. These men be wise to all
iniquite: but they have no learning to do good. And for as much as that
facou^dyous and greek poet Hesiodus counts him good for nothing which
neither is wise of himself / neither yet will follow and do after him that
gives him good counsel. Of what degree than shall they be counted which when
they themself be most shamefully deceived / yet never seace to trouble / to
laugh / to scorn and put in fear them which all ready be come to their
wits again? But shall not the mocker be mocked? He that dwells in heaven
shall mock them again / and our lord shall laugh them to scorn. Thou redest
in the book of Sapyence / they shall se verily and shall despise him / but god
shall mock the^. To be mocked of lewd men / is as it were a praise. And no
doubt it is a blessed thing to follow our heed Christ and his apostles / and a
fearful thing truly to be mocked of god. I also (says the wysdom) will laugh
wha^ ye perysshe / and mock you wha^ that thing has happened to you which ye
feared / that is to say / when they awaked out of their dream and come again
to themself when it is to late / shall say. E^yl^ men say ye good me^ as ye
live now so lived such and such pope holy fools / and this came of them and
so we trust to se happen of you.
These be they whom we have had in derysyon and reprofe / we for lack of
understanding have counted their lives to be madness / and their end to be
without honor. This wisdom is beestly / and as James says diabolyke and of
the devil / and is an ennemy to god / whose end is destruction. Note how one
vice brings in an other.
For always after this wysdom follows as a waytyng servant or handmayde
myscheuous p^sumpcion / after p^sumpcyon follows blyndnes of mind after
blyndnes of mind follows fervent rage and tyranny of affections and
appetytes / after the tyranny of affections follows the hole hepe of al vices
and liberty to do what he lysteth Than follows custom / after follows most
wretched dulnes or insencibilitye of mind / a dasynge of the wits for lack
of capacitye. By which it is caused that evil men perceive not them self to
sin. And whiles they be in such insencibilitye without any fealyng or
perceyuyng of themself / bodyly death comes suddenly on them / and after it
follows the second death / which is death everlasting. Thou see how the
mother of thextreme myschefe is worldly wysdom / but of the wysdom of Christ
The wisdom of Christ.
which ye world thinks folyshnes / this wise thou redest. All good things
came to men by hepes with her / and ine^^ymable honestye by the hands of her.
And I reioysed i^ al things because this wysdom went before me / and I was not
ware that she was mother of al good things. This wysdom brings with her as
companyons sobrenes and mekenes. Mekenes disposes and makes us apt to
receive the spirit of god. For in the lowly / humble and meke person he
reioyseth to rest. And when ye spiryt has replenysshed our minds with his
seue^folde grace / than forthwithal spryngeth that plenteous erbage of al
virtue with those blessed fruytes of which y^ chief is the secret joy of a
clear conscience / which joy is known of none but only of such to whom it
has chanced to taste of it. Joy that never vanyssheth away / nor fades with
the joys of this world / but increases and grows to eternal gladness and
mirth. This wysdom my brother (after the counseyle of James) must thou require
of god with fervent and brennyng desire. And after the counseyle of the wise
man dygge her out of the veins of holy scripture / as it were treasure hyd in
the earth. The chief part of this wysdom is that thou sholdest know thy self
/ which word to have descended from heaven the antiquite byleued and so much
has that saying pleased great auctours / yt they judged al plenty of wysdom to
be shortly co^prehe^ded in this lyrel sentence / that is to wit / if a man
know himself. But let the weight or authorite of this conclusyon and doctrine
be of no valor with us / except it agree with our lernyng. The mystical lover
in canticis thretneth his spouse / and byddeth her to get her self out of ye
doors / except she know her self / saying. O thou beautefull among al women
/ if thou know not thy self / go out of the doors and walk after the steps
of thy flock and sort. Therefore let no man p^sumptuously take upon him this
so great a thing / to think that he knows him self well enough. I am not
sure whether any man knows his body unto ye uttermost / and tha^ how can a
man know ye state of his mind surely enough? Paul whom god so loved that he
saw ye mysteryes of the third heaven / yet durst he not judge himself which
thing doutles he would have been bold to do / if he had known himself surely
enough. If so spiritual a man which discerns al things and is him self to
be judged of no man / was not surely enough known to himself. How should we
carnal men presume? In conclusion let him seem to be a very unprofitable sowdy
our / which surely enough neither knew his own company / neither his enemies
host. Thou may read of Jason and diverse other how they sowed serpents tethe
and how of them sprange Gyantes which fought among them selfe^ and slew each
other.
But so it is that one christen man has not war with an other but with
himself / and verily a great host of adversaries spryng out of our own
flesh / out of the very bowels and inward part of us Likewise as it is
read in certain poets tales of the brethren gendred of the earth. And there
is so little dyfference between our ennemy and our friend / and so hard to
know the one fro the other / that there is great ieopardy leest we somewhat
recheles or neclygent defend our ennemy instead of our friend / or hurt our
friend instead of our ennemy. The noble capteyn Iosue was in doubt of an
angel of light / saying Art thou on our part / or of our enemies part.
Therefore seeing that thou have taken upon the war against thy self / and the
chief hope and comfort of victory is if thou know thy self to the uttermost /
I will paynte a certain image of thy self / as it were in a table / and set
it before thine eyes that thou may perfytly know what thou art inward and
within thy skin.

gifts are found to them inferyours. In our minds verily we be so celestial
and of godly capacite that we may surmount above the nature of angels / and be
vnyt / knyt and made one with god. if thy body had not ben added to the / thou
had ben a celestial or godly thing. God is thautour of peace.
if this mind had not ben graffed in ye / plainly thou had ben a brute
be. The serpente is the maker of debate.
These two natures between them self so diverse / that excellent werkma^ had
coupled together with blessed co^corde: but the serpent the ennemy of peace put
them asonder again with unhappy discord: He holds the wolf by the ears /
this proverb we use o^ the^ which be in such co^bra^ce fro whe^s they can in
no wise ryd them self The proverb this wise spro^g A certain man walked in a
forest upon whom came a wolf ^ he could make no other shyf^ but took hi^ by
the ears which were so short that it was hard to hold them: yet durst he
not let the^ go nor lay hand on his wepo^s for fere of bytyng / but held fast
and cried for help.
so yt now they neither can be separate without very great turment and pain /
neither live joined together without contynual war And plainly after the
co^mun saying each ^n the other holds the wolf by ye ears / and either may
say very well and accordingly to the other that proper and pleasant verse of
Catullus. I neither can live with the nor without the. Such ruffeling
wranglynge and trouble they make between them self with comberous debate as
things diverse / which in deed are but one. The body verily as he himself is
vysyble / so delyteth he in things vysyble. As he is mortal / so follows he
things te^porall. As he is heavy / so synketh he downwarde. On the other party
the soul myndeful of her celestyall nature enforces upward with great
violence and with a terrible hest stryueth and wrastleth with the heavy burden
of ye erthly body. She despises these things that are seen / for she knows
them to be tra^sitory / she seeks true things of substance which be
permanent and ever abydyng and because she is imortal and also celestial she
loves things imortal and celestial / and reioyseth with things of like
nature / except she be utterly drowned in the fylth of ye body and by
contagiousnes of him has gone out of kind from her natyue gentylnes. And
verily neither Prometheus so much spoken of among poets sowed this discord
in us a porcyo^ of every be myxed to our mind / neither our prymatyue and
first making gave it / that is to say / it spronge not in us naturally / or
nature gave it not to us i^ our first creacio^ or natiuite: Poets feign
promethens to have made me^ of claye and th^ugh help of (...) to put life in
the^ and a porcyon of every bee^^ as the fy^rsnes of the lion the wylynes of
the for the ferefulnes of the have and so of other beestes.
but sin has evil corrupt and decayed that which was well created /
sowynge the poison of dissencio^ between the^ that were honestly agreed / for
before ye time both the mind ruled ye body without besynes / and the body
obeyed without grudgi^g. Now is it clean contrary. The order between the^ is so
troubled / the affections or appetytes of the body strive to go before reason /
and reason is in a manner compelled to enclyne and follow the judgment of the
body. Man is compared to a comen welthe or realm / where is a king / lords /
and the comen people.
Thou may compare therefore a man properly to a co^munaltie / where is debate
and part taking among them self. which co^munaltie for as much as it is
made of sundry kinds of men gathered together / which be of diverse and
contrary appetytes. It can not be avoided but that much strife shall rise
therein / and parts taken oftentimes / one les the chief rule and authorite be
in one. And he him self be such a fellow that will command nothing but
that which shall be wholesome and profitable for the common welthe. And for
that cause it must needs be that he which is most wise should most bear
rule. And he needs must obey that leest perceyueth or understands. Now there
is nothing more folysshe than the rascal or vile co^munaltye. And therefore
ought they to obey the officers and rulers / and bear no rule nor office them
self. The noble estates or such men which be most ancient of age / ought to
be herd: but so that it lie only in the kings ar^ytreme^t to make statutes
and laws / whom it is mete to be advertised to be put in remembrance or
counseyled now and than. But it is not mete that he should be compelled / or
that any man should maystrye or rule him. And finally the king obeys no man
but the law The king obeys the law only.
only The law must be correspondent to the orygynall decree of nature or the
first example of honestye. wherefore if this order subverted the unruly co^munes
/ and that ragynge dregs of the cite shall strive to go before the senyours:
or if y^ chief lords shall despise the commandment of ye king / than aryseth
perylous sedicyo^ or diuisyon in our common wealth / ye and except the
prouisyon / decree or auctorite of god socour / all the matter weyeth and
enclyneth to extreme mischefe and to utter destruction. Reason is king in a man.
In man reason bears ye rowme of a king. Thou may account for the chief
lords certain affections and them of the body: The lords be certain gentle
affections.
but yet not all things so beestly. Of the which kind is natural reverence
toward the father and mother / love to thy brethern / a benyuole^t mind
toward thy friends and lovers. Co^passyo^ upon them that be vexed with
aduersite or combred with sycknes. Fear of infamy / sclau^der or loss of thy
good name Desire of honest reputacyo^ / and such other like. The com^ners be
v^ le appetytes.
But such affections or passions which be very greatly disagreyng from the
decrees of reason / and which be cast down and must bow even to the vylenes
of brute beestes. Think and reken those to be as it were the most raskal and
vile sort of ye co^mun people Of which kind and sort be lechery / riot / envy
/ and such like diseases / which al without excepcio^ must be kept under i^
pson / and with punyshme^t as vile and bond servants that they render to
their master their task and work appointed to them if they can: but if not at
y^ leest yt they do no harm. which things Plato perceyuyng by inspiracyon of
god / wrote in his book called Timens how ye sons of gods had forged in man
to their own lykenes two kinds of souls / the one kind spiritual and
i^mortal / the other as it were mortal / in danger to diverse perturbacions
or mocyons of unquietness. Four affections of the mind Joy sorrow hope and
fear.
Of which the first is voluptuousnes (as he says) the bayte whereby men are
allured and brought to vngracyousnes or mischefe. The next is sorrow or grefe
which lets men / and dryueth them from virtue or goodness. After that fear
and presumptuous boldness / two mad cou^seylours: whom acco^panyeth indurate
wroth / the desire of vengeance. More over flateryng hope with beestly
ymaginacyon and knowledge not governed of reason / and worldly love that lays
hands violently on all things. These be almoost the words of Plato / and it
was not unknown to him the felicity of this life to be put in refraynyng of
such perturbacyo^s / for he writes in the same work them for to live justly
and blessedly / which should have ouerco^me these appetytes / and them for to
live unjustly and myserably that should be ouerco^me of the same. And to that
soul which is like unto the nature of god / that is to say / unto reason / as
unto a king he appointed a place in the brain / as in the chief toure of our
cite: Reason dwells in the brain as in the palace.
and as thou may se the highest part of our body / and next to heaven / and
most far fro the nature of a be / as a thing verily which is both of a
very thynne bone / and neither lade with gross synewes nor flesh / but
surely furnysshed and appointed within and also without / with powers of
knowledge / that through the showing of them no debate should rise in our common
welthe / which he should not immediately perceive: but as touching the parts
of the mortal soul / that is to wit / the affections or appetytes as every
one of them is / either obedyent / or else grudgeth against reason. So he
removed them fro him / for between the neck and the mydriffe he set that part
of the soul / wherein is contained boldness / wrath or anger / a sedicyous
affection verily and full of debate / which needs must be refrayned: The power
wherein is contained wrath and ^ate.
but he is not very brutysshe or beestly / and therefore he separate him in a
mean space from the highest and lowest / leest if he had been to nygh to either
of them / he would either have troubled the kings quietness / or else corrupt
with the contagyousnes of them of the lowest sorts should with them also
conspyre against him. Last of all that power which desires the voluptuous
pleasure of meat and drink / whereby also we be moved to bodyly lust / he
banysshed utterly away far fro the kings palace down allow bynethe the
mydrys^e in to the liver and the paunche / that as it were a certain wild
be untamed / he should there stable and dwell at the rack / for because
that power is accustomed to reyse up mocyons most violent / and to be
disobedyent to the commandments of the king. The power wherein is contained
desire.
what beestlynesse ye and what rebellyon is in the lowest porcyon of this power
/ at the leestwaye the preuy parts of thy body may teache the in which part
chefely this power of concupiscence rages and tyranny reygneth / which also of
all members only ever among makes rebellyon with uncleanly mocions / the king
cryenge the contrary / and that in vain. Thou see than euydently how that
this noble be man / so goodly a thing above plainly and without any
excepcyon ends in an unreasonable or brute be. But that noble cou^seylour
which sytteth like a king or a ruler in his high toure / having always in
remembrance his own beginning thinks no fylthy nor low thing. The
ornaments of a king.
And he has whereby he may be known from other a scepter of yuorye / because
he does command nothing but yt which is right and good / in whose top
writes Homere to set an egle / because that reason mountyng up to celestial
things / beholds from above those things that be on the ground
disdeynfully / as it were with egles eyes. In co^clusio^ he is crowned with a
crown of gold / for gold in the mystycall lettres most co^munly betokens
wysdom. And the circle betokens that the wysdom of the king should be perfyte
and pure in every part. These be the very gifts or virtues properly belongyng
to kings. First that they be very wise that they do not amysse by reason of
error and lack of true knowledge. And tha^ such things as they know to be
good and right / those only to will and purpose to do that they do nothing
against the decree or judgment of reason inordynatly / frowardly and
corruptly. And who so ever lacks any of these two points / count him to be
not a king / that is to say a ruler / but a robber.

Of the diversity of affections. Ca.v.
OUr king Reason may be oppressed verily / yet because of y^ eternal law which
god has graven in him he can not be corrupted but that he shall grudge and call
back. we ought to live after reason and not after affections.
To whom if the resydue of the co^munaltie will obey / he shall never commit
any thing at all either to be repented or of any ieopardye: but all things
shall be admynystred with great moderacyon discretly / with much quietness and
tranquilite But as touching affections / verily Stoici and Peripotetici
Perypoteticy will that affec^ions should be reframed only thynkyng the necessary
to provoke and to stir a man to virtue
varye somewhat / though both agree in this that we ought to live after reason
/ and not after affections. But Stoici Stoici be the folowers of plato which
put filicite and blessedness i^ the i^ward co^sta^cye of the mind only / if a
man were so armed with all vtues that he might be wounded with no darte of
aduersite or fortune saying also no outward goods of fortsie nor outward
gifts of nature be reqred necessaryly unto felycyte but the testimony of
conscience inward to be sufficient.
will when we have used for a season (as it were a scholemaister to teache us
our first principles) the affections which immedyatly are stered up of the
sensual powers / and now be come to judgment and true examinacion what is to
be ensued or chosen / and what to be eschewed or forsaken that than we utterly
dampne and forsake them. For than are they (as they say) not only no profit
to very wysdom / but also hurtful and noyous. And therefore they will that a
perfyte wise man should lack all such mocyons / as diseases or sycknesses of
the mind / ye and scarsely they grant to a wise man these first mocions /
more gentyl preue^tyng reason which they call fantasyes or ymaginacyons.
Peripotetici teache the affections not to be destroyed utterly / but to be
refrayned / and that the use of them is not utterly to be refused / for because
they think them to be given of nature / as a prycke or a spur to styre a man
to virtue As wrath makes a man bold and hardy / and is a matter of fortytude.
Perypotetici be Arystoteles folowers which say a man apayled with all ki^de
of vtue and with a pure conscience to be a good man / yet not happy or blessed
/ for they will beatitude to rest in the act and outward practice of virtue in
profyting the co^enwelth Therefore say they / riches / fre^des / strength of
body / health / eloquence and such like to be required necessarily without
which a man cannot profit another / yet would they not such things to be
desyr^^ for love of the things the^ self but to profit the come^welth and
for the co^uersacyon of mankind.
Envy is a great cause of polycy / and in likewise of the other Socrates in a
certain book that Plato made called Phedo / seems to agree with Stoici /
where he thinks philosophy to be nothing else but a meditacio^ or practisyng
of death / that is to say / that the mind withdraw her self as much as she
can from corporal and sensyble things / and co^uey her self to those things
which be perceived with reason only / and not of the sensible powers. First
of al therefore thou must behold and consider diligently all the mocions
mouynges or steryng of thy mind / and have them surely known. Farthermore
thou must understand no mocyons to be so violent but they may be either
refrayned of reason / or else turned to virtue. Notwithstanding I hear
euerywhere this contagrous opinyon / that some should say they be constrained
to vices: and on the other side many for lack of knowledge of them self follow
such mocyons as the sayings or decrees of reason: in so much that what so
ever wrath or envy does counsel or move them to do / that they call the zele
of god: and as thou see one co^mun wealth to be more unquiet than another:
Some man is more prone to vtue then some
so is one man more enclyned or prone to virtue than another which difference
comes not of y^ diversity of minds / but either of the i^fluence of
celestial bodies / or else of our progenitors / or else of the bryngyng up in
youth / or of ye co^plectio^ of the body. The fable of Socrates of carters and
horses good and bad is none old wives tale: for thou may se some to be borne
of so moderate / soft / quiet and gentyl disposicyon / so easy to be handled /
to be turned and wynded / that without besynes they may be enduced to virtue /
and renneth forward by their own courage without any spurrynge. The rebellion
of nature is to be imputed to no man.
To some clean contrary thou may perceive to have happened: a body rebellyous
as a wild and kyckyng horse: in so much yt he which tameth him shall have
enough to do and sweet apace / and yet scarce with a very rough bytte / scarce
with a waster and with sharp spurs can subdue his fyersnes. If any such one
has happened to the / let never ye rather thy heart fail ye / but so much the
more fervently set upon it / thynkyng on this wise: not that the way of virtue
is stopped or shut up from the: but a larger matter of virtue to be offered
unto the. But and if so be that nature has endued the with a gentle mind /
thou art. not therefore streyghtway better than an other man / but happyer / and
yet again on that manner wise art thou more happy / so that thou art also more
bound. How be it what is he yt is endued with so happy gifts of nature /
which has not habou^dau^tly things enough to wrestle withal. Therefore in
what part shall be perceived most rage or rebellyo^ to be / in that part
reason our king must watch diligently. Some vices follow the countres.
There be certain vices appropriate to every country / as to break promise
is famylyar to some: to some riot or prodigalite: to some bodyly lust or
pleasure of the flesh / and this happens to them by ye disposycyon of their
countrees. Some vices accompany the complexion of the body Some vices follow
the co^plexcion of the body
/ as appetite and lust for the company of women and the desire of pleasures
and wanton sportes accompany the sanguyne men. wrath / fyersnes / cursed
speking follows the coleryke men. Grosnes of mind / lack of actiuite /
sluggishnes of body / and to be given to much sleep / follows the flumatike
man. Envy inward heaviness / bytternes / to be solytary / self minded / soleyn
and chorlysshe follows the melancolyke person. vices folowi^g the age.
Some vices abate and encreace after the age of man / as in youth lust of y^
body / wastfull exspences and rashness / or folysshe hardynes. In old age
nyggyshnes or to much saving / waywardnes and avarice. vices appropryed to
kind.
Some vices there be which should seem appropriate to kind as fyersnes to the
man / vanite to the woman and desire of wreke / or to be revenged. It fortuneth
now and tha^ that nature as it were to make ame^des / recompenseth one disease
or sycknes of the mind / with an other certain contrary good gift or
propertye. An evil dy^ease of the mind is sometime reco^pensed with an other
good gift i^ properte.
One man is somewhat prone or enclyned to pleasure of worldly pastymes / but
nothing angry / nothing enuyous at all. An other is chaste / but somewhat proud
or high minded / somewhat hasty / somewhat to gredy upon the world. And there be
which be vexed with certain wonderful and fatal vices / with theft /
sacrylege and homicyde: which truly thou must withsta^de with all thy might /
against whose assault must be cast a certain brazen wall of sure purpose. On
the other side some affections be so nygh neighbors to virtue / that it is
ieopardous leest we should be deceived the diuersitye is so dangerous and
doutfull. Let the vices wh^che draw nere unto virtue be corrected.
These affections are to be corrected and amended / and may be turned very well
to that virtue which they most nygh rese^ble. There is some man (because of
example) which is soon set a fire / is hot / at ones provoked to anger with
the leest thing in ye world / let him refrain and sobre his mind / and he
shall be bold and courageous / nothing faint herted or fearful / he shall be
free of speech without dissimulacion. There is another man somewhat holdi^g / or
to much saving let him put to reason / and he shall be called thryfty and a
good husband. He that is somewhat flateryng shall be with moderacyon curteys and
pleasant. He that is obstynate may be constant. Solempnes may be turned to
grauite. And that has to much of folysshe toys / may be a good companyon. And
after ye same manner of other so^what easyer diseases of the mind / we must
beware of this only yt we cloak not y^ vice of nature with the name of virtue
/ calling heaviness of mind grauite / crudelite justice envy zele / fylthy
nyggyshnes thryfte / flatering good fellowship / knavery or rybaldry vrbanue or
merry spekyng. Put not the name of (...) to any manner of vice.
The only way therefore to felicite is first that thou know thy self: know
thy self.
more over that thou do nothing after affections / but in all things after the
judgment of reason: Do all things after the Judgment of reason
let reason be sou^de and pure and without corrupcion: let not his mouth be out
of taste / that is to say / let him behold honest things. But thou wily
say: it is an hard thing that thou co^maundest: who says nay? And verily
the saying of Plato is true: what so ever ^hynges be fair and honest / the
same be hard and trauaylfull to obtain. Nothing is more hard than that a man
should over come himself. The saying of saint Jerome.
But than is there no greater reward than is felicite. Iheronymus spoke that
thing excellently as he does al other things: nothing is more happy than a
christen man / to whom is promised the kingdom of heaven: nothing is in greater
peril than he which every hour is in ieopardye of his life: nothing is more
strong than he yt overcomes the devil: nothing is more weyke than he that
is ouerco^me of the flesh. If thou ponder thine own strength only /
nothing is harder than to subdue the flesh unto the spirit. If thou shalt
look on god thy helper / nothing is more easy. Than now therefore co^ceyue
with all thy might and with a fervent mind the purpose and professyon of the
perfyte life. And when thou have grounded thy self upon a sure purpose / set
upon it and go to it lustely: man's mind never purposed any thing ferue^tly
that he was not able to bring to pass. To be willing to be a chryste^ man is a
great part of chrystendome.
It is a great part of a christen life to desire with full purpose and with
all his heart to be a christen man / that thing which at the first sight or
metynge / at the first acquaintance or coming to shall seem impossyble to be
conquered or won / in process of time shall be gentle enough and with use
easy: in conclusion with custom it shall be very pleasant. It is a very
proper saying of Hesiodus. The way of virtue in process wereth easy
The way of virtue is hard at the beginning / but after thou have crept up
to the top there remains for the very sure quietness. No be is so wild
which wexeth not tame by the craft of man. And is there no craft to tame the
mind of him that is ye tamer of all things. That thou might be hole in thy
body / thou can steadfastly purpose and command thy self for certain years
to abstain from drynkyng of wine / to forbear the flesh and company of
women: which things the phisician being a man p^scribed to the. And to live
quietly al thy life can thou not rule thine affections / no not a few
months? which thing god that is thy creator and maker commands the to
do? To save thy body from sycknes there is nothing which thou do not: to
deliver thy body and thy soul also from eternal death do thou not these
things which infideles ethnici and gentyles have done.

Of the inward and outward man and of the two parts of man / proved by holy
scripture. Caplo.vj.
CErteynly I am ashamed in christen men's behalf / of whom the most part
follow as they were brute beestes their affections and sensual appetytes / and
in this kind of war are so rude and unexercised / that they do not as much
as know the diversity between reason and affections or passions. Christ in
mathsayth he came to make not peace but de^isyon to set the father against the
sone / the sone against his father / the wife against her husbonde the
husbonde against his wife and so forth. The hystorye means that at sometime
and in some places the husbonde should accept the faith of christ only and
follow his holso^ doctrine and the wife should persecute him / sometime the wife
should follow christ and the husbonde persecute her / andin likewise the son
his father and the father the sone.
They suppose yt thing only to be y^ man which they se and feel / ye and they
think nothing to be beside the things which offer them self to ye sensyble
wits when it is nothing less than so. what so ever they greatly coueyte /
that they think to be right: they call peace / certain and assured bondage /
while reason oppressed and blinded follows whether so ever ye appetyte or
affection calls without resistance This is yt miserable peace which Christ
the author of very peace that knyt two in one came to break / styryng up a
holsom war between the father and the sone / between the husband and the
wife / between those things which fylthy concord had evil coupled together.
Now than let the authority of the philosophers be of little weight / except
those same things be all taught in holy scripture / though not with the same
words. That the philosophers call reason / that calls Paul sometime ye
spiryt / sometime ye inner man / otherwhyle the law of the mind. Reason / the
spyryte / the inner man / the law of the mind / be one thing with paul
That they call affection / he calls sometime the flesh: sometime ye body: an
other time the utter man and the law of the m^^res. walk (says Paul) in the
spirit / and ye shall not accomplysshe the desires and lusts of the flesh /
for the flesh desires contrary to the spirit / and the spirit contrary to
the flesh / that ye can not do what so ever things ye would. Affection / the
flesh / the body the utter man / the law of the members / be one thing with
paul.
And in an other place. if ye shall live after the flesh / ye shall dye. if ye
shall walkyng in the spirit mortifye the deeds of the flesh / ye shall live.
Peace / life / lyberte of soul / is the war / death / bondage of the body.
Certain this is a new change of things / that peace should be sought in
war / and war in peace: in death life / and in life death: in bondage liberty
in liberty bondage. For Paul writes in an other place. I chastise my body and
bring him in to servitude. Hear also the liberty If ye be led with the spiryt
/ ye be not subject to ye law. And we have not (says he) received again the
spirit of bondage in fear / but the spirit which has elected us to be ye
children of god. He says in an other place. I se an other law in my me^bres
repugnynge against the law of my mind / subduyng me to the law of sin
which law is in my members. Thou redest with him also of ye utter man which
is corrupt / and of the inner man which is renewed day by day. Plato put
two souls to be in one man. Paul in one man makes two men so coupled together
/ that neither without other can be outher in heaven or hell: A double man.
and again so separate that the death of the one should be life of the other. To
the same (as I suppose) perteyn those things which he wrote to the Chorintes
The first man was made in to a living soul. The last Adam was made in to a
spirit quyckenynge: The last ad^m is Christ.
but that is not first which is spiritual / but that which is living: than
follows that which is spiritual. The first man came of the earth him self
terrestryall. The second came from heaven and he himself celestial. And
because it should more euydently appear these things to pertayne not only to
Christ and Adam / but to us all / he added saying. As was the man of the earth /
such are terrestryall and erthly persons. As is the celestial man / such are
the celestial persons Therefore as we have borne the image of the erthly man:
even so now let us bear the image of the celestyall man. For this I say
brethren that flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of heaven / nor
corrupcion shall possess incorrupcion. Thou perceyuest plainly how in this
place he calls Adam made of earth that thing which in an other place he
calls the flesh and the utter man which is corrupt. Jacob fygureth the
spiryt Esau the flesh.
And this same thing certainly is also the body of death / wherewith Paul
agreued cried out Oh wretch that I am / who shall deliver me from this body of
death. Jacob and Esau the so^es of Isac and Rebekca fought in their mothers
b^ly she (...) with god / and he answered of the^ shall spring two (...) people
which should ever be at wa^re but the (...) should (...) the younger Esau was
first borne and Jacob followed hold^ge Esau fast by the (...). Afterward (...)
a (...) sold to Jacob his (...) for (...) of (...). when Isac was old he hade
Esau to ky^^ some ve^^^^ that I mygnt (...) of it and ^^ysse the or I dye.
In conclusion Paul declaryng the most diverse fruit of the flesh and of
the spirit writes in an other place / saying. He that sows in his flesh
shall repe or mow of his flesh corrupcyon: but he that sows in the spirit
shall repe or mow of the spirit life eternal. This is ye old debate of two
twynnes Jacob and Esau / which before they were brought forth in to light
wrastled within the cloisters of the mothers belly / and Esau verily caught
from Jacob the preemynence of birth / and was first borne: but Jacob prevented
him again of his fathers blessing. That which is carnal comes first / but
the spiritual thing is ever best. The one was reed / high colored and rough
with heare^ the other smothe. The one unquiet and a hunter: the other reioysed
in domestical quietness. And the one also for hunger sold the right that
perteyned to him by inherytaunce / in yt he was the elder brother / while he
en^ced with a vile pressed and reward of voluptuousnes / fell from his natyue
liberty in to the bondage of sin. The other procured by craft of grace that
which belonged not to him by right of law. But by the deuyce and means of the
mother Jacob stale away his fathers blessyng and was made lord of his brother.
Bitwene these two brethern though both were borne of one belly / and at one
time / yet was there never joined perfyte concord / for Esau hates Jacob /
Jacob for his part though he quyteth not hate for hate / yet he flees and
has ever Esau suspected / neither dare come within his danger. Then came
Esau waylyng to have a blessing / then answered the father. I have made him
thy lord.
To the likewise what so ever thing affection counseyleth or persuadeth / let
it be suspected. For the doutfull credence of the counseylour Jacob only saw
the lord. After that Jacob saw our lord face to face.
Esau as one delytyng in blood lives by the sword. To conclude when the
mother asked counseyle of the lord he answered: the elder shall be servant to
y^ younger: but the father Isaac added: in good me^ the spirit which is
fygured by Jacob rules / and the body obeys. In evil men the flesh which
is sygnyf^ed by Esau rules of him the em^yre of down y^n of the spyryte.
thou Esau shall do service to thy brother: and the time shall come when thou
shall shake of and loose his yoke from thy neck. The lord prophecyeth of good
and obedyent persons / the father of evil and disobedyent persons. The one
declares what ought to be done of al men: the other told before hand what y^
most part would do. Paul wylleth that the wife be obedye^t to her husband:
for better is / says scripture) the iniquite of the man ^ tha^ the goodness of
y^ woman. Our Eve is carnal affection / whose eyes y^ subtyle and crafty
serpent daily troubles and vexes with te^ptacyon / and she is ones corrupt
gothe forth and seaseth not to provoke and entyce the man also through consent
to be part taker of the iniquitye or myscheuous deed. The woman here
signyfyeth a carnal person which changed by grace of faith follows the
bidding of the spyryte in every thing.
But what redest thou of the new woman / of her I mean that is obedyent to
her husband / I will put hatred between the (meaning the serpent and the woman)
and between her generation and thine / she shall trede down thy heed / and
thou shalt lay awayte to her hele. The woman sygureth affection The man reason.
The serpent was cast down on his breast / the death of Christ weyked his
violence / he now only lies awayte to her hele pryuely. Abraham had ^ son by
his seruau^te Agar whose name was Ismaell and an other b^ his wise Sara who^e
he called Isaac. Ismael was much elder then Isac and in playeng together
mysentreated Isac wherewith sara displeased bad Abraham put away thy servant
Agar with her son also which Abraham was loath to do / but god co^man^ded him to
obey his wives request.
But the woman through grace of faith changed as it were in to a man boldly
tredeth down his venymous heed Grace is increased and the tyranny of the
flesh is dymynysshed. when Sara was mynysshed and decayed / than did Abraham
(god being the author) grow and increase. And than she calls him not
husband but lord / neither yet could she opteyn to have a child before she
was dried up and bareyn. what I pray the brought she forth at the last to her
lord Abraham now in her old days / ye and past child bearyng. Ueryly Isaac yt
is to say joy / for as soon as affections have wexed old and are weyked in a
man / than at the last springs up the blissed tra^quilite of an i^noce^t
mind / with sure quietness of ye spiryt / as it were a continual feast. And as
y^ father let not his wife have her pleasure without aduiseme^t: eue^ so has
the sportyng of y^ children together suspecte / I mean of Isaac with Ismaell.
Sara would not ye child of a bondwoma^ and the child of a free woman should
have co^uersacyon together at yt age: but yt Ismael (while as yet youth is
fervent) should be banisshed out of p^sence / lest under a color of pastyme he
might entice and draw unto his own manners Isaac yet young and tender of age.
Let youth ^^ee the occasyon of sin.
Now was Sara an old wife and now had brought forth Isaac / yet mystrusteth
Abraham except the answer of god had approved his wives counsel / he is not
sure of the woman until he herd of god. In all things yt Sara has said to
the / hear her voice. O happy old age of them in whom so mortyfyed is the
carnal man made of the earth / that he in nothing besyeth the spirit / which
agreement whether in all things perfyte may happen to any man in this life or no
/ verily I dare not afferme / peradventure it were not expedient / for even
unto Paul was given unquietness and trouble of the flessh yt messenger of
satan to vex him withal. Trouble of the flesh is expedyent to the exercise of
virtue and custody of humylyte.
And at ye third time he despred to have yt messenger taken from him Than had
he none other answer of god but only this. Paul my grace is sufficient for
the. For strength is wrought and made perfyte in weyknes. In deed this is a
new kind of remedy. Paul leest he should be proud is tempted with pride /
yt he might be strong in Christ: he is compelled to be weyke in himself: he
bare the treasure of celestial reuelacio^s in a vessel of earth / that the
excellencye should depend of ye might of god / and not of himself / which one
example of thapostle puts us in remembrance and warns us of many things.
when thou art tempted fall to prayer.
First of all that when we be assaulted of vices / i^mediatly. we must give our
self to prayer again / and desire help of god. Hydra was a serpente with
many heddes of which one was immortal with her fought hercules and when he
smo^e of one heed. (...) ^^range for it / At the last he fought with a
bourni^g sword and so sered he their necks that they (...) no more ^^rynge.
More over that temptacions to perfyte men are not perylous: but also are very
expedyent to the contynuau^ce and preseruyng of virtue. Last of al when al
other things are full tamed than the vice of vaynglory even in ye chief time
of virtues lays awaite: and this vice to be as it were Hidra / whom Hercules
fought withal a quycke monstre long of life and fruytful / by reason of her
own wou^des / which at ye last end when all labors be ouerco^me can scarce be
destroyed. Nevertheless contynuall and i^portunate labor overcomes al thing.
In the mean time while thy mind rages and is vexed with vehement
perturbacyons / by all manner means thrust together / draw down / hold and
bind this Protheus Protheus that is to say affection must be hold down.
with tough bands while he goth about to change himself in to all manner
monstres and affections of things / in to fire / in to the shappe of some
terrible wild be and in to a r^nyng river until he come again in to his
own natural lykenes and shappe. what is so like Protheus Protheus is a god
which chau^geth him to all manner facyons / he is a great prophesier but he will
tell nothing without co^pul^yon.
as is the affections and appetites of fools which draw them sometime in to
beestly and bodyly lust / sometime in to mad ire or wrath / otherwhyle i^ to
poison envy and strange fascions of vices. Agrees it not well that ye
excellent connyng poet Uirgil said: Uyrgyll reherseth of arestew which had
lost his beestes and co^selled with his mother ^^rene a gods how he might
restore the^ again she sent him to prothe^ and taught ^ craft to bind him
until he had told the truth / then taught protheus how of a deed and
puerified ox they might be restored again
there shall diverse similitudes and fascyons of wild beestes delude and mock
/ for suddenly he will be a fearful swyne and foul tygre / and a dragon full
of seals / and a lioness with a reed mane / or shall counterfeyte the quycke
sound of ye slame of fire: but here have in remembrance what follows. The
more he changes him self in to al manner of similitudes / the more my sone
(says Uirgil) strain thy tough ba^des. And also because we shall not need to
return again to fables of poets / thou shall by thensample of the holy
patriarch Jacob learn to endure and to wrestle lustely all night unto the
morning of the help of god begin to give light. Jacob wrastled with an
angel all night. who^ in the morning he would not let go until he had
blyssed him in the same place / the angel smote his thygh and the synewes
shranke so that Jacob halted on the one leg after that.
And thou shall say / I will not let the depart except thou shall have given
me thy blessyng first. But what reward of his victory and great virtue that
mighty and excellent strong wrastler obtained / it is certainly very
profitable to hear. First of al god blessed him i^ that same place. For
evermore after that the temptacyon is ouerco^me / a certain synguler increase
of divine grace is added unto a man / whereby he should be an other time much
more surely armed tha^ he was before against the assault of his enemy.
Farthermore through touching of ye thigh the synewe of the co^querour wexed
wyddred and shronke / and he began to halte on the one foot. God curses them
by the mouth of his prophet which halt on both their fete / that is to say /
them which will both live carnally / and please god also. But they be happy in
whom carnal affections be so mortifyed / that they bear and leave most of all
to the right foot / that is / to the spirit Finally his name was changed: of
Jacob he was made Israel / and of a besy wrastler a quiet person. After that
thou have chastysed thy flesh or thy body / and crucyfyed him with vices and
concupiscences / than shall tra^quillite and quietness without all trouble come
unto the / that thou may be at ley^er to behold the lord / that thou may
taste and feel yt the lord is pleasant and sweet / for yt thing is signified
by Israel. God appere^^ after a great tempest.
God is not seen i^ fire / neither in the horle wind and troublous rage of
temptacyon / but after the tempest of the devil (if so be that thou shall
endure perseuerau^tly) follows the hyssynge of a thynne air or wind of
spiritual co^solacyon. He has walked.xl. days and xl. nyghtes unto the
mount of Or^ll where he prayed in a cave / A voice had him come forth and
stand before god / and then came a great wind then a quaki^ge then fire / and
god not in the fyre^ then followed the hyssynge of a thynne air / and then
appeared god to Elyas.
After that air has brethed quietly upon the / than apply thine inward eyes
/ and thou shalt be Israel / and shall say with him. I have seen my lord /
and my soul is made hole. Thou shalt se him that said: no flesh shall se me
/ that is to say / no carnal man. Consider thy self dylygently / if thou be
flesh / thou shalt not se god: if thou se him not / thy soul shall not be
made hole Take heed therefore that thou be a spirit.

Of three parts of man / the spirit / the soul / and the flesh. Caplo.vij.
THese things before written had been and that a great deal more than
suffycyent: Origene in his first book upon the epistle of paul to the romans
makes this diuysion.
nevertheless that thou may be somewhat more sensybly known unto thy self /
I will rehearse compendyously the dyuysyon of a man / after the description of
Orygene / for he follows Paul makes three parts / the spirit / the soul
and the flesh / which three parts Paul joined together / writing to the
Thessalo^ice^ces. That your spirit (says he) your soul and your body may be
kept clean and incorrupt / that ye be not blamed or accused at the coming of
our lord Jesus Christ And Esaias (leuing out the lowest part) makes mencyon of
two / saying my soul shall desire and long for the in the night / ye and in
my spirit and my heart strings I will wake in the mornings for to please the.
Also Daniell says / let the spirytes and souls of good men laud god. Out of
the which places of scripture Origene gathers not against reason the three
peticions of man / that is to wite / the body / otherwise called the flesh
The flesh.
/ the most vile part of us / where in the malycyous serpent through original
trespace has written the law of sin / wherwithall we be provoked to
fylthynes. And also if we be ouercom we be coupled and made one with the
devil. Than the spiryt The spyryte.
wherein we represent ye similitude of the nature of god / in which also our
most blessed maker after the original pattern and example of his own mind
has graven the eternal law of honesty with his finger / that is with his
spirit ye holy ghost. By this part we be knyt to god / and made one with him.
In the third place and in the mids between these two he puts the soul /
which is part taker of the sensyble wits and natural mocions. Thou must
remember the soul and the spirit to be one substance / but in the soul be
many powers as wit will / memory: but the spyrite is the most pure and fardest
fro corruption the most high and divine portion of our soul.
She is in a sedicious and wranglyng common wealth must nedely join her self
to ye one part or the other / she is troubled of both parts / she is at her
liberty to whether part she will enclyne. If she forsake the flesh and
convey her self to the parts of the spiryt / she her self shall be spiritual
also. But and if she cast her self down to ye appetites of the body she shall
grow out of kind in to the manner of ye body. This is it that Paul meant
writing to the Chorintes. Remember ye not that he yt joins himself to an
harlot is made one body with her: Capar of god imediatly wherein god has
graue^ the law of honesty that is to say the law natural after the
similitude of the eternal law of his own mind.
but he that cleueth to the lord / is one spiryt with him He calls the harlot
the frail and weyke part of the man. This is that pleasant and flateryng
woman of whom thou redest in the second chapter of proverbs on this wise.
That thou may be delivered from a strange woman and from a woman of an other
country / which makes her words sweet and pleasant / and forsakes her
husband to whom she was married in her youth / and has forgete the promise
she made to her lord god: her house boweth down to death and her path is to
hell. who so ever gothe in to hell / shall never return: nor shall attain the
path of life. And in the.vj. chap. That thou may keep the from an evil woman
/ and from the flateryng tongue of a strange woman / let not thy heart melt on
her beauty / be not thou deceived with her beckes / for the price of an harlot
is scarce worth a piece of breed: but the woman takes away the precious soul
of the man. Did he not when he made mencyon of the harlot / the heart and the
soul express by name three parts of the man. Again in the.ix. chapter. A
folysshe woman ever babbling and full of words / swi^myng in pleasures / and
has no learning at all / sytteth in the doors of her house upon a stole in an
high place of the cite to call them that pass by the way and be going in
their journey / who so ever is a child / let him turn in to me: and she said
unto a fool and an hertles person: water that is stolen is pleasau^ter / and
breed that is hyd pryuely is sweter. And he was not ware that there be gyau^tes
/ and their gestes be in the bottom of hell. For who so ever shall be coupled
to her / he shall desce^de in to hell And who so ever shall depart from her /
shall be saved. I beseech the with what colors could more workmanly have be
painted and set out either the venymous entycementes and wanton pleasures of
the poisoned flesh / prouokyng and temptynge the soul to fylthynes of sin
/ or else the importunytye of the same cryenge and stryuyng against the spirit
/ or the wretched end that follows when she does ouerco^me the spirit. To
conclude therefore / the spirit makes us gods / the flesh makes us
beestes: the soul makes us men: the spirit makes us relygyous / obedyent to
god / kind and merciful. The flesh makes us despysers of god / disobedyent
to god / unkind and cruel. The soul makes us indifferent / that is to say
/ neither good nor badde. The spirit desires celestyal things: the flesh
desires delycate and pleasant things. The soul desires necessary things:
the spirit caryeth us up to heaven: the flesh thrusts us down to hell. To
the soul nothing is imputed / that is to say / it does neither good nor
harm: what so ever is carnal or spryngeth of the flesh that is fylthy: what
so ever is spirytuall procedyng of the spirit / that is pure / perfyte and
godly: what so ever is natural and proceeds of the soul / is a mean and
indifferent thing / neither good nor bad. wylt thou more plainly have the
diuersytye of these three pertes showed unto the as it were with ^ man's
finger? certeynly I will assay. Thou do reverence to thy father and mother:
That which is natural deserves no reward.
thou love thy brother / thy children and thy friend: it is not of so great
virtue to do these things / as it is abhomynable not to do them. For why
sholdest thou not being a christen man do that thing which the gentyles by the
techyng of nature do / ye which brute beestes do? That thing that is natural
shall not be imputed unto merit. But thou art come in to such a strayte case
that either ye reverence toward thy father must be despised / ye inward love
toward thy children must be subdued / the benyuole^ce to thy friend set at
naught / or god must be off^^ded. what will thou now do? The soul stands in
the mids between two ways: the flesh cries upon her on ye one side / the
spirit on the other side. The spirit says / god is above thy father: thou
ar^ bound to thy father but for thy body only. To god thou art bound for all
thing that thou have. The flesh (...) the in remembrance / saying. Except
thou obey thy father / he will disheryte the / thou shall be called of every
man an unkind and unnatural child / look to thy profit have respect to thy
good name and fame. ^^d either does not se / or else dissimuleth and wyttyngly
looks beside it / or at ye leest will be soon pacifyed again. Now thy soul
doubts / now she wauereth hither and thither / to whether of either part she
turn her self. The soul doubts.
That same shall she be / that that thing is she went unto. if she obey the
harlot / that is to say the flesh (the spirit despised) she shall be one
body with the flesh. But and if she lift up her self and ascend to the
spirit (the flesh set at naught) she shall be tra^sposed and changed to the
nature of the spirit. After this manner accustom to examyne thy self
prude^tly. The error of those men is exceeding great which ofte^tymes weneth
that thing to be perfyte virtue and goodness which is but of nature and no
virtue at al. Some affections be dysgysed with visers of virtue.
Certain affections somewhat honest in apperance / and as they were disguised
with visers of virtue / deceyueth neclyge^t persons. The judge is hasty and
cruel against the felon: An example of the Judge.
or him that has trespaced the law he seems to himself constant and of
grauite incorrupt and a man of good conscience / wylt thou have this man
discussed? If he favor his own mind to much and follow a certain natural
rygorousnes without any grefe of mind / peradventure with some pleasure or
delectacyon: yet not lenyng from the office and duty of a judge / let him not
forthwith stand to much in his own conceyte: it is an indifferent thing
that he does. But if he abuse the law for pryuate hate or lucre / now it is
carnal that he does / and he co^mytteth murder: but and if he feel great
sorrow in his mind because he is compelled to destroy and kill him / whom he
had lever amended and saved. Also if he enjoin punysshme^t according to the
trespace with such a mind / with such sorrow of heart / as the father
commands his syngulerly beloved sone to be cut / launced or seared: of
this manner shall it be spiritual that he does. The most part of men through
pronesse of nature and some special propertye / either rejoice or abhor
certain things. Some men rejoice naturally with some certain things.
Some there be whom bodyly lust tikleth not at al: let not them by and by
ascrybe that unto virtue which is an indifferent thing / for not to lack
bodyly lust / but to ouerco^me bodyly lust is the office of virtue. An other
man has a pleasure to fast / a pleasure to be at mass / a pleasure to be
much at church and to say a great deal of psalmodye: The rule of ^rue pity.
examyne after this rule that thing which he does: if he regard the common
fame or aduau^tage / it smells of ye flesh and not of the spirit: if he do
follow but his own inclynacyon (for he does that which pleases his own
mind) than he has not whereof he so ought greatly to rejoice / but rather
whereof he ought to fear. Let a christen man mark this well.
Behold a ieopardous thing unto thy self. Thou prayest and iudgest him that
prays not. Thou fastest / and condempnest him that fasteth not. who so ever
does not that thou do / thou thynkest thy self better than he: beware
leest thy fall perteyne to thy flesh. Thy brother has need of thy help /
thou in the mean space mumblest in thy prayers unto god / and wylt not be
known of thy brothers necessite. God shall abhor these prayers: for how
shall god hear ye while thou prayest / wha^ thou which art a man caust^ not
find in thy heart to hear an other man. Perceive also an other thing Thou
love thy wise for this cause only that she is thy wife: Thou do no great
thing / for this thing is common as well to infydeles as to the: Or else
thou love her for none other thing but because she is to the pleasant and
delectable. Thy love now draws to thy flesshwarde. But thou love her for
this thing chefely / because thou have perceived in her the image of Christ /
which is godly reverence / modestye / sobrenes / chastity: The chaste love
toward thy wife.
and now love not her in her self but in Christ: yea rather Christ in her.
After this manner love spirytually. Notwithstanding we shall say more of
these things in their places.

Certain general rules of true christen living. Ca.viij.
NOw for because we have opened as me seems ye way (how so ever we have done
it) and have p^pared as it were certain stuff and matter unto the thing which
was purposed. we must haste to that which remains / leest it should not be
an Enchiridion ^^^^^ridion.
/ that is to say / a little treatise hansom to be carried in a man's hand /
but rather a great volume / we will enforce to give certain rules / as they
were certain points of wrestling / by whose guyding and conueyaunce / as it
were by the guydyng of ye threde of Dedalus men may easily plunge up out of the
blind errors of this world / as out of Labirinthus / which is a certain
comberous maze / and come unto the pure and clear light of spiritual living.
None other science is there which has not her rules. And shall the craft of
blessed living only / be without the help of all manner p^ceptes? (...) the
craft of virtue.
There is without fail a certain craft of virtuous living and a discyplyne /
in which who so ever exercise themself manfully / them shall favor that holy
spirit / which is the promoter and brynger forward of all holy enforceme^t
and godly purposes. But who so ever says / depart from us we will not have ye
knowledge of thy ways: these men the mercy of god refuses / because they first
have refused knowledge. These rulers shall be taken partly of the person of god
/ of the person of the devil / and of our person / partly of things / that
is to say / of virtues and vices / and of things to them annexed / partly of
the matter or stuff whereof virtues or vices be wrought They shall profit
synglerly against three evil things remaynyng of original sin For though
baptym have wyped away the spotte / yet there cleueth still in us a certain
thing of the old disease left behind / both partly for the custody of
humylytye / and also for the matter and increase of virtue. These be blyndnes /
the flesh and infyrmytye or weykenes. Blyndnes with the mist of ignorance
dymmeth the judgment of reason. For partly the sin of our first progenytours
has not a little dusked that so pure a light of the countenance / resemblau^ce
or similitude of god / which our creator has showed upon us Nota.
And much more corrupt bringing up lewd company / froward affections /
darkness of vices / custom of sin has so ^ancred it / that of ye law graven
in us of god scarce any signs or tokens does appear. Than as I began /
blyndnes causes that we in the election of things be as good as half blinded
and deceived with error / in the stead of the best / following the worste /
preferrynge things of less valor before things of greater price. The
flesh troubles ye affection so much / yt even though we know what is best
/ yet love we ye contrary. Infirmytye and weyknes makes us that we being
ouerco^me either with tedyousnes or with temptacion / forsake the virtue which
we had ones gotten and attained. Blyndnes hurts the judgment the flesh
corrupts the will / infirmytie weyketh constancye. Evil must be known and
had (...).
The first point therefore is that thou can discern things to be refused from
things to be accept: and therefore blyndnes must be take away leest we stumble
or stager in the election of things The next is / that thou hate the evil as
soon as it is ones known / and love that which is honest and good: and in
this thing the flesh must be ouerco^me / leest contrary to ye judgment of
the mind we should love sweet and delectable things in the stead of holsom
things. The third is / that we co^tynue in these things which we began well:
Perseyuera^ce must be had.
and therefore the weyknes must be underset / leest we forsake the way of virtue
with greater shame than if we had been never about to walk or enter therein.
Ignorance must be remedied / that thou may se which way to go. The flesh
must be tamed / leest she led the aside out of the high way / ones known in
to bypathes. weyknes must be conforted / leest when thou have entered in to the
strayte way thou sholdest either faynte or stop or turn back again / or
leest after thou have ones set thy hand to ye plowe sholdest look backwarde /
but sholdest rejoice as a strong gyau^t to haste the way / ever stretchyng
forth thy self to those things which be before the without remembrance of
those things which be behind the / until thou may lay hand on the reward
appointed and on ye crown promised to them yt co^tynue unto these three things:
therefore we shall apply certain rules according to our little power.

Against the evil of ignorance the first rule. Caplo.ix.
BUt in asmoche as faith is the only gate unto Christ / the first rule must be
that thou judge very well both of him and also of scripture we must Judge well
of scripture
given by his spiryt / and that thou believe not with mouth only / not fayntly
/ not neclygently / not doutfully / as the common rascal of christen men do:
but let it be set fast and i^mouable through out all thy breast / not one jot to
be contained in them that apperteyneth not greatly unto thy health. (...)
Let it move y^ nothing at all that thou see a great part of men so live /
as though heaven and hell were but some manner of tales of old wives / to fear
or flater young children withal: (...)
but believe thou surely and make no haste / though the hole world should be
mad at ones / though the elements should be changed / though the angels
should rebel: yet verite can not lie / it can not but come which god told
before should come. if thou bileue he is god / thou must believe needs that he
is true also / and on this wise think without waueryng / nothing to be so true
/ nothing to be so sure / and without doubt of the things which thou hear
with thine cares / which thou p^sently beholdest with thine eyes / which thou
handlest with thy hands / as those things be true which thou redest in the
scriptures / that god of heaven / that is to say verite gave by inspiracyon
which the holy prophets brought forth / and the blood of so many martyrs has
approved: unto which now so many hondreth years the consent of all good men
has agreed and set their seals: which Christ here being in flesh both
taught in his doctrine and expressly represented or cou^terfeyted in his manners
and living. Unto which also miracles bear wytnes / the deuylles confess and
so much believe / that they quake and tremble for fear. Last of al which be
so agreeable unto the equite of nature / which so agree between themself / and
be every where like themself / which so rauyssheth the minds of them that
attend / so moves and changes them. If these so great tokens agree unto them
alone / what the deuylles madness is it to doubt in the faith? ye of those
things passed thou may easily coniecte what shall follow: how many and great
things also / how incredyble to be spoken did the prophets tell before of
Christ: which of these things came not to pass? shall he in other things
deceive which in them deceived not? In conclusyon the prophets lied not / and
shall Christ the lord of prophets lie? If with this and such other like
cogytacyons thou often stere up the flame of faith / and than fervently desire
of god to increase thy faith I shall marvel if thou can be any long time
an evil man. For who is all together so unhappy and full of myschefe that would
not depart from vices / if so be he utterly believed that with these momentany
pleasures / beside the unhappy vexario^ of conseyence and mind is purchased
also eternal punyshmentes. On the other side / if he surely byleued for this
temporal and little worldly vexacyon to be rewarded or recompensed to good men
an hondreth fold joy of pure conscience presently: and at the last life
immortal.

The second rule. Caplo.x.
LEt the first point be therefore that thou doubt in no wise of ye promyses of
god. The next yt thou go unto ye way of life / not slouthfully / not
feerfully: we must enter in to the wave of health or sal^acion boldly. and with
a ^oco^de courage.
but with sure purpose / with all thy heart / with a confident mind / and (if I
may so say) with such mind as he has that would rather fight than drink: so
that thou be ready at all hours for Christ's sake to lose both life and
goods. A slothful man will and will not. The kingdom of heaven is not gotten of
necligent and recheles persons / but plainly reioyseth to suffer violence: And
violent persons violently obtain it. Suffer not the affection of them whom
thou love syngularly to hold the back hastyng thither ward: Egypt
sygnyfyeth bondage / afflyccion / vices and blyndnes
let not the pleasures of this world call the back again: let not the care
of thy household be any hyndraunce to the. The cheyne of worldly business must
be cut asonder / for surely it can not otherwise be losed. The Israel yt^ being
a ho^g^^^ in desert wysshed to go back again to Egipte / saying to Moy^es /
how happy were we when we sat there by the pottes of flesh
Egypt must be forsaken in such a manner that thou turn not again in thy mind
at any time unto the pottes of the flesh. Sodoma must be forsaken utterly
hastily yea and at ones: it is not lawful to look back. The woman looked back
she was turned in to yt image of a stone. The man had no leyser any where to
abide in any region / but was commanded to haste in to the mountain / oneles
that he had lever to have perysshed. Lot was comanded to depart hastily out
of Sodoma and not to look back / his wise looked back and was toned in to a
sa^^ston / so we may neither with the Israelyte^ desire to goo back again to
the pleasure of Egypt of vices and sin: neither with the wife of Lotte may
look ba^k again to our old co^uersacio^.
The prophet cries out yt we should flee out of the mids of babylon. The
departing of the israelytes from Egypt is called flight or ronnyng away. we be
commanded to flee out of babylon hastily / and not to remove a little and a
little slowly. Thou may se the most part of men prolong the time / and with
very slow purpose go about to flee from vices. when I have ones ryd my self
out of such and such matters / say they / yea when I have brought that and
that besynes to pass. Oh fool what and if god this same day take again thy
soul from the? perceyuest thou not one besynes to rise of an other / and one
vice to call in an other. why rather do thou not to day that thing which
the sooner thou do / the easyer shall it be done / be dylygent some other
where. (...)
In this matter to do rashly to run heedlong and suddenly is chefest of all
and most profitable. Regard not nor ponder how much thou forsakest / but be
sure Christ only shall be sufficyent for all things: only be bold to commit
thy self to him with all thine heart: Confydence in god.
set thou mystruste in thine own self / adventure to put unto him all the
governance of thy self: trust to thy self no longer / but with full
confydence cast thy self from thy self to him / and he shall receive the:
committee thy care and thought to the lord / and he shall nourysshe the up /
that thou may sing the song of the same prophet. Serve Christ all together
/ and no man else.
The lord is my governor / and I shall lack nothing. In a place of pasture
he has set me / by the water side of comfort he has brought up me: he has
converted my soul: be not minded to part thy self in to two / to the world
and to christ: thou can not serve two masters: there is no felawshyp between
god and belial. God can not away with them which halte on both their legs:
his stomach abhors them which be neither hot nor cold / but luke warm.
God is a very ialouse lover of souls: he will possess only and all together
that thing which he redeemed with his blood: he can not suffer the felawshyp of
the devil whom he ones overcame with death. There be but two ways only Two
ways only / the one of sainatio^ / the other of perdition.
/ the one which by obedyence of the affections ledeth to perdicyon: the other
which through mortyfyenge of the flesh ledeth to life. why doubtest thou in
thy self / there is no third way / in to one of these two thou must needs
enter / wylt thou or wylt thou not / what so ever thou art / or of what degree
/ thou must needs enter in to this strayte way / in which few mortal men
walk. Ad^asta nemesis or Rha^nus^a is a gods which punyssheth insolency she
forbids that any man look to high if any so do he escapes not unpunished
though it be never so late: if any be to full of insolency we say / take heed
Rhamnusya sees the well enough.
But this way Christ him self has trod / and have trodden since the world
began who so ever pleased god. This is doubtless the inevitable necessite of ye
gods Adrasta / otherwise called Nemesis or Rha^nus^a / that is to say / it
can not be chosen but that thou be crucified with Christ as touching the world
/ if thou purpose to live with Christ. why like fools flater we our self /
why in so weyghty a matter deceive we our self. One says / I am not of the
clergy or a spu^al man / I am of the world / I can not but use the world. An
other thinks / though I be a priest yet am I no monk / let him look upon it.
And the monk also has found a thing to flater himself withal / though I be
a moke yet am I not of so strayte an order as such and such. An other says.
Every man puts to an other the life of Christ and ^ayinges of his ^postelles.
I am a young man I am a gentle man / I am rich / I am a courtyer / and to be
short a prince / those things perteyn not to me which were spoken to
thapostles. Oh wretch then aperteyneth it nothing to the that thou sholdest
live in Christ? If thou be in the world / in Christ thou art not: if thou call
the sky / the earth the sea and this co^mun air the world: The world.
so is there no man which is not in the world: but and if thou call ye world
ambicyon / yt is to say / desire of honor / promocio^ / or authorite: if thou
call ye world pleasures / covetousness / bodyly lust: certeynly if thou be
worldly thou art not a chryste^ man. Christ spoke indifferently to al men: who
so ever would not take his cross and follow him / could be no mete man for him
/ or be his disciple: The reward is given to him that laboreth.
to dye with Christ as touching the flesh is nothing to the / if to live by
his spirit perteyneth nothing to the: to be crucified as touching the world
perteyneth nothing to the / if to live godly or in god perteyne nothing to the:
to be buried together with Christ belongs nothing to the if to arise again to
eternal glory belong nothing to the: the humilite / pouerte / tribulacy on /
vile reputacyon / the laborous agonyes and sorrows of Christ perteyne no thing
at all unto the / if the kingdom of him perteyne nothing unto the. what can be
more lewd than to think ye reward to be common as well to the as to other:
and yet nevertheless to put the labors whereby the reward is obtained / from
the / to a certain few persons. what can be more a wanton thing tha^ to desire
to reygne with ye head / and yet will thou take no pain with him. Therefore my
brother look not so greatly what other men do / and in co^paryson of them
flater or please thy self. To dye as touching sin: to dye as touching
carnal desires: to dye as touching the world is a certain hard thing and
known to very few / yea though they be monks / and yet is this the co^mun or
general perfessyon of all christen men. Monks.
This thing a great while agone thou have sworn and holyly promised in ye
time of baptym: than which vow what other thing can there be either more holy /
or religyous? either we must perysshe / or else without excepcio^ we must go
this way to health whether we be knights or plowe men. Notwithstanding though
it fortune not to al men to atteyn the perfyte cou^terfeytyng or following of
the heed / yet al must enforce with fete and hands to come thereto. He has a
great part of a christen man's living / which with all his heart with a sure
and steadfast purpose has determined to be a christian man.

The third rule. Caplo.xj.
BUt leest that thing fear the from the way of vtue because it seems sharp
and grievous / partly because thou must forsake worldly co^moditees / partly
because thou must fight continually against three very cruel enemies / the
flesh / the devil and the world. Set this third rule before the always /
bear thy self in hand that all the feerful things and fantasies which apere
forthwith unto the as it were in ye first entering of hell ought to be counted
for a thing of naught / by thexa^ple of Uirgilies Encas E^eas i^ the.vi. book
of virgil went down in to hell accompanied with the prophe^esse ^ybyll in the
first en^rye appeared many fantasyes and wonderful mo^stres not so perylious in
deed as they apered.
For certeynly if thou shall consider ye very thing somewhat grou^dly and
steadfastly (setti^g at naught these appare^t things which begiled thine eyes)
thou shall perceive that none other way is more commodious than the way of
Christ. Though thou account this thing not at all that this way only ledeth to
eternal life / yea and though thou have no respect unto the reward. For I
beleche the what kind of living after the common course of the world is
there that thou can chose in which thou shall not bear / and suffer things
enough haboundantly both careful and grievous. Who is he that knows not the
life of courtyers to be full of grievous labor and wretched mysery / except
it be either he that never proved it or certainly a very natural fool. Oh
immortal god what bondage / how long and how ungoodly must there be suffered
even unto the lives ende^ what a comberous business is there in sekyng in
purchasyng the princes love and grace. A man must flatter to obtain the
favor of all such as may either hinder or further one. The countenaunces
must now and than be feyned and new fassyoned. The injuries of the gretter
men must be whyspered or muttered with silence secretly. The life of warryours.
Consequently what kind of yuell life can be ymagyned where of ye life of
warryours is not full? Of either life than may thou be a very good witness
/ which have learned both at thyn own peril. The life of marchautes.
And as touching the merchaunt man what is that he either does not or
suffers not fleyng pouertye by see / by lands / through fire and water? In
matrimony what a mountain of household ^ares be there? The mesery of matrymony.
what mysery feel not they there which proves and has experpe^ce of it. In
bearyng of offices how much vexacyon / how much labor / and how much
peril is there / which way so ever thou turn thy self an huge company of
incommodytes meteth the. In bearing of offices.
The very life of mortal me^ of it self without addycion of any other thing
is combred and tangled with a thousand myseryes which be comen and
indifferent as well to good as bad. A christen man obteyneth merit in every
thing.
They all shall grow into a great heap of merytes unto the if they shall
find the in the way of Christ / if not they shall be the more grievous / more
over frutlesse / and yet must never ye less be suffered. who so ever be
souldyers of this world / first how many years do they pante / blow /
sweat / and canuasse the world tourmentynge them self with thought and care
/ more over for how transytorye and things of naught? Last of all in how
doubtful hope. Add to this that there is no rest or easement of myseries / in
so much that the more they have labored the greuouser is the pain. And when
all is paste what shall the end be of so tedyous and laborous a life / verily
eternal punysshement. Go now and with this life compare the way of virtue /
which at the first seaseth to be tedyous / in process is made easyer / is
made plesaunt and delectable / by which way also we go with very sure hope to
eternal felycite. were it not the vttermoste madness to have lever with
equal labor to purchase eternal death rather than life immortal? yet are
these worldly men much madder than so / that they which chose with ex^reme
labor to go to labor everlasting / rather than with mean labors to go to
immortal quietness. Tic^es because he would have joined with appollos mother
was cast of apollo down to hell where vulters gnawe his heart eue^ encre^synge
again.
More over if the way of pytie or obedyence to god were so much more laborous
than the way of the world / yet here ye greuousnesse of the labor is swaged
with hope of reward / and the comfort of god is not lacking which tourneth
the bytternesse of the gall in to the swetnesse of honey. The meaning of the
fable is this / he was a great man a^^ co^de not be co^te^ted but would have
more and aduau^ced him self to more honor and would have put apollo out of his
co^tree which signyfied by his mother / but apollo subdued him and spoiled him.
There one care calls in an other / of one sorrow springs another / no
quietness is there at all. The labor and affllyctyon withoutforthe / the
grievous cares and thoughts withinforthe cause the very easementes to be sharp
and bitter. These things so to be was not unknown to the poets of the
gentyles which by the punysshment of Ticius / Ixion / Tantalus / Sisiphus /
and of Pentheus / painted and discryued the miserable and grievous life of leude
and wretched persons: of whom is also the late confession in the book of
Sapyence. ^f his possessyo^s so that afterward he lived in care and mysery
among the lowest sort and could not obtain any forther honor.
we be weryed in the way of inyquite and perdycion / we have walked hard
ways / but y^ way of god we know not. what could be either fylthyer or more
laborous than the seruytude of Egypt? yrion was cast of Juno lady of honor in
to hell where he ^onneth ^oside and co^tynually co^passeth for honor but he
could not obtayn.
what could be greuouser than the captyuyte of Babylon? what more intolerable
than the yoke of Pharao and of Nabugodonosor? But what says Christ? take my
yoke upon your necks and ye shall find rest unto your souls: my yoke says
he is plesaunt and my burden light. To speak breuely / no pleasure is
lacking where is not lackyng a quiet conscience. Syfyphus rolleth a stone from
the hill foot to the top / tha^ slydeth the stone and he discendeth to fetch
him up again.
No mysery is there lacking where an unhappy conscience crucyfyeth the mind.
These things must be taken as of most certaynty / but and if thou yet doubt
go ask of them which in time passed have been converted out of the myddle of
Babylon unto the lord: Ambytion is ever at the hill foot he is ^e^er so high
but that he has one hyl more to clymbe / he sees one thing more which he
covers.
and by experyence of them at ye leest way believe nothing to be more troubelous
and grievous than vices / nothing to be more easy or of quycker speed than not
to be drowned in business / no thing more cherefull and more comfortable than
is virtue. Never the less go to let it be that the wages be like / and that
the labors be like also / yet for all that how greatly ought a man to desire
to war under the standerde of Christ / rather than under the baners of the
dyuell. Iantalus stondeth still in hell in a river of wine ever a thurst / and
almaner of fruytes about him and yet he is ever hungry nether is suffered to
drink or eat.
ye how much lefer were it to be vexed or to suffer afflictyon with Christ /
than to swymme in pleasures with the dyuell. More over ought not a man with
wind and wether with ship sail and swyftnesse of horses to fly from a lord
not very fylthy only but very cruel and disceytfull / which requires so
cruel service and so strayte a task / which promyseth again things so
uncertain / so caduke / so transytorye / which so sone fade and vanysshe
away / of the which very same things yet disceyueth he the wretches and that
not seldom. Couctous men dare not use their gooddes but be hungry and thyrsty
for more.
Or though he perform his promise ones / yet another time wha^ it pleases
him he takes them away again / so that the sorrow and thought for. Pentheus
was turned in to an heart and eeten of his own dogs and he did non other
thing all his life but hunte and follow dogs: so he consumed himself and
his substance like a fool wretchedly and bestly
the loss of things ones possessed is much more than was the grievous labor
in purchasyng them. After that the merchaunt man has myngled together both
right and wrong for the intent of encreasynge his goods / after he has put
his honest reputacyon of good report that is spronge of him / his life / his
soul in a thousand ieopardyes / if it so be than that ye chance of fortune
hap aryght at the later end with all his travail what other thing has he
prepared for him self more than the matter of miserable care if he keep his
goods / if he lose them a perpetual tourment. The troublous care of a
merchants.
If fortune chance a mysse what remains but yt he should be made twyse a
wretch wrapped in double mysery / partly because he is disapoynted of the
thing whereon his hope hanged / beside that because he can not remember so great
labor spent in waste without much both sorrow of heart and grefe of mind. No
man enforseth with sure purpose to come to good living or co^uersacyon which
has not attained it. Christ as he is not mocked / so neither he mocketh any
man.

Remember an other thing / when thou flyest out of the world unto Christ /
if the world have any co^modytyes or pleasures that thou forsakest them not /
but chau^gest tryfles with things of more value. who will not be very glad to
change silver for gold / flynte for precious stone? Thy friends be
displeased? what than / thou shalt find more plesaunt and better companyons.
Thou shalt lack outward pleasures of thy body / but thou shalt enjoy the
inward pleasures of the mind / which be better / purer / and more certain.
Thy good must be demynisshed / never ye less these richesse increase which
neither the mouths distroy northeues take away. Thou ceasest to be of price
in the world / but thou for all that art well beloved of Christ: Thou
please the fewer / but yet the better.

Thy body waxes lean / but thy mind waxes fat. The beautye of thy skin
vanyssheth away / but the beautye of thy mind apereth bright. And in like
manner if thou shalt reken all other things thou shalt perceive nothing not
of all these apparent good things to be forsaken in this world / that is not
recompensed largely with greater advantage and more excellent a great way.
Many thing may be reseyued and possessed but not desired.
But if there be any things which though they can not be desired without vice
/ yet without vice may be possessed: Of which kind of things is the good
estymacyon of the people / favor of the co^munaltie / love or to be in
conceyte / authoryte / friends / honor due to virtue. For the most part it
chaunseth yt al these things be given without serchyng for / to them that
above all thing seek the kingdom of heaven / which self thing Christ promised
and god performed to Solomon. Fortune for y^ most part follows them that
flies from her / and flies from the that follow her. Certainly what so ever
shall happen to them that love / nothing can be but prosperous unto whom loss
is turned to aduau^tage / tourment / vexacyon or aduersite to solace / rebukes
to laud punysshment to pleasure / bitter things to swetnesse / yuell things
to good. Doutest thou than to enter in to this way and forsake that other way /
seeing there is so unequal comparyson / ye none at all of god unto the dyuell
/ of hope to hope / of reward to reward / of labor to labor / of solace to
solace.

The fourth rule. cap.xij.
BUt that thou may haste and make speed unto felycite with a more sure
course / let this be unto y^ the fourth rule / that thou have Christ Let Christ
be thy mark and en^a^ple of living
always in thy sight as the only mark of all thy living and co^uersacyon /
unto whom only thou should dyrecte all thyn enforcementes / all thy pastymes
and purposes / all thy rest and quietness / and also thy business. What
christ is.
And think thou not Christ to be a voice or sou^de without signifycasyon /
but think him to be nothing else save charity symplycite / or innocence /
pacyence / clennesse / and shortly what soever Christ taught. Understande well
also that the dyuell is none other thing but what soever calls away from such
things as Christ taught. what the dyuell is.
He directs his journey to Christ which is carried to virtue only. And he
becomes bond to the dyuell which gives him self to vices. Let thine eye
therefore be pure / and all thy body shall be bright and full of light. Let
thine eye look unto Christ alonely as unto only and very felycyte / so that
thou love nothing / marvel at nothing / desire nothing but either Christ or
else for Christ. Also that thou hate nothing / abhor nothing / fly nothing
/ nothing avoid but only sin or else for sins sake. By this means it will
come to pass yt what so ever thou shalt do / whether thou sleep / whether
thou wake / whether thou eat / whether thou drink / and to conclude that thy
very spor^es and pastymes / ye (I will speak more boldly) that some vices of ye
lyghter sor^e in to which we fall now and tha^ while we haste to virtue / all
ye hole shall grow and turn in the unto a great heap of rewards. But and
if thine eye shall not be pure / but look any other ward than unto Christ / ye
though thou do certain things which be good or honest of them self / yet
shall they be unfruitful or peradventure very peryllous and hurtful. For it is
a great fault to do a good thing not well. And therefore that man that hastes
the straight way unto the mark of very felycite / what so ever things shall
come and mete him by ye way / so farforth ought he either refuse or receive
the^ as they either further or hinder his journey: How ferforth things
prosered unsought for ought to be refused.
of which things there be three orders or three degrees. Certain things
verily be of such manner fylthe that they can not be honest / as to avenge
wrong / to wysshe yuell to another. (...)
These things ought always to be had in hate / ye though thou should have
never so great aduau^tage to commit the^ / or never so great punysshme^t if thou
dyddest the^ not / for nothing can hurt a good man but fylthynesse only.
Certain things on the other side be in such manner honest that they can not be
fylthy / of which kind be to will or wisshe al me^ good / to help thy
friends with honest menes / to hate vices / to rejoice with virtuous
comunycaion. Things honest.
Certain things verily be indifferent or between both / of their own nature
neither good nor bad / honest nor filthy: as health / beutie / strength /
facu^dyousnesse / co^nynge / and such other. Of this last kind of things
therefore nothing ought to be desired / for it self neither ought to be usurped
more or less / but as ferforthe as they make and be necessary to y^ chief
mark / I mean to follow Christ's living. The very philosophers have certain
marks also vnperfyt and indifferent / in which a man ought not to stand still
nor tarry / which also a man may co^uenye^tly use referryng the^ to a better
purpose / and not to enjoy them and tarry upon them putting his hole felycite in
them: not withstanding those mean and indifferent things do not al after one
manner and equally either further or hinder them yt be going unto Christ /
therefore they must be received or refused after as each of the^ is more or
less of value unto thy purpose. Pytie (...) fyeth ser^^^^ honor / reverence /
obedyence due to god
Knowledge helps more unto pytie than beauty or strength of body or riches:
and though al lerni^g may be applied to Christ / yet some helps more
co^pendyously tha^ some. Science must be loved for christ's sake.
Of this end and purposele thou measure the profytablenes or vnprofytablenes
of al mean things. Thou love lerni^g / it is very well if thou do it for
Christ's sake: but if thou love it therefore only because thou would know it /
than make thou a stop and taryeng there from whence thou ought to have made
a step to clymbe further. But if thou desire scyen^es that thou by their help
myghtest more clearly behold Christ hid in the secrets of scripture / and
when thou know him love him / when thou know and love him teach /
declare / and open him to other men / and in thy self enjoy him. Than prepare
thyselfe unto study of seye^ces but no further than thou may / think them
profitable to good living. If thou have confydence in thy self and trust to
have great advantage in Christ / go forth boldly as an aduenterous merchaunt
to walk as a stranger somewhat further / ye in the lernyng of gentyles / and
apply the richesse or treasure of the egyp^iens unto the honestyng of the
temple of god. how ferforthe the letters of the ge^tyles be to be red ^loke in
the second chap^tre what this means.
But and if thou fear greater loss than thou hopest of advantage / than
return again to our first rule: know thy self and pass not thy bo^^des /
keep the within thy lystes. It is better to have less knolege and more of love
/ than to have more of knowledge and not to love. Knowledge therefore has the
maistrye or chief room amongst mean things. After that is health / the
gifts of nature / eloquence, beautye / strength / dignyte / favor /
authorite / prosperyte / good reputacion / kynne friends / stuff of household.
Every one of these things as it helps most and nyghest way unto virtue / so
shall it most chefely be applied in case they be offered unto us hastynge in
our way / if not than may we not for cause of them turn a side from our
journey purposed. Money suhlde this wise beloved.
Money chaunsed unto the / if it let nothing to good living mynister it / make
fre^des with the wicked ma^mon: but if thou fear loss of virtue and good
mind / dispyse that aduau^tage full of damage and loss / and follow thou even
Crates of Thebes flyeng thy grievous and comberous pack in to the sea / rather
than it should hold the back from Christ. Crates of the cite of Thebes cast
a great so^e of gold in to the sea / saying hence ye mische ^ us richesse /
better it is that I drown you than you me he supposed that he could not
poscesse richesse and virtue both together.
That thing may thou do the easylyer / if as I have said / thou shalt
custom thy self to marvel at none of those things which be without the /
that is to say / which pertayne not unto ye inner man / for by that means it
will come to pass y^ thou can neither wax proud or forget thy self. If
these things fortune unto the neither thou shalt be vexed in thy mind if
they should either be denied the or taken from y^ / for as much as thou
put thy hole felicyte in Christ only. But and if it chance they come
unto ye besides thine own labor / be more dylygent and cyrcu^spect having no
less care than thou had before: have in mind that a matter to exercise thy
self virtuously on is given to the of god / but yet not without ieopardy and
danger. Because Prometheus had made a man of cley and with fire stolen from
heaven put life in to him / Iupyter sent p^nd^^ a woman with a box full of al
kinds of diseses to hi^ but prometheus was provided and refused it but his
brother Epymetheus received it and opened it and than al manner of sycknesses
^lewe abroad.
But if thou have the benignyte of fortune suspected cou^terfayt Prometheus /
do not receive ye disceytfull box / and go light and naked unto that which is
only very felycite. Certainly who soever with great thought and care desire
money as a precious thing / and count the chief socour of life to be therein /
thinking them self happy as long as it is safe / calling them self wretches
when it is lost: Those men no doubt have made or feyned unto themself many
gods. Thou have set up thy money and made it equal unto Christ / if it can
make ye happy or unhappy. That I have spoken of money understand the same
likewise of honors / voluptuousness / health / ye and of ye very life of the
body. Prometheus taught rude me^ ciuyle and honest manner / yet would he be^e no
rule amongst them but fled to soli^arynce / thynki^g all kinds of mysery to
be in berynge rule / but his brother Epymetheus took the misery upon him.
we must enforce to come to our only mark which is Christ / so fe^uently y^
we should have no layser to care for any of these things / either when they be
given us / or eis wha^ they be taken from us / for the time is short as says
Paul: Hence forward says he they that use the world / must be as they used
it not. This mind I know well ye world laugheth to scorn as folysshe and
mad: never ye less it pleases god by this folysshnesse to save them yt
believe. And ye folisshnesse of god is wyser tha^ man. After this rule thou
shall examyn / ye what soever thou do. Thou exercysest a craft? when labor
is profitable.
it is very well done if thou do it without fraud: but whereunto lokest thou to
find thy household? but for what intent to find thy household / to win thy
household to Christ? thou ro^nest well. Thou fastest / verily a good work as
it apereth outward: when fastyng^ is superstycious.
but unto what end referrest thou thy self / to spare thy vitayles or that
thou may be counted the more holy? Thine eye is wanton / corrupt / and not
pure. Peradventure thou fastest leest thou should fall in to some disease or
sycknesse. why fear thou sycknesse? leest it would take the from y^ use of
voluptuous pleasures: thine eye is corrupt. But thou desyrest health because
thou may be able to study. To what purpose I beseech the referrest thou thy
study to get the a benefyce withal? with what mind desyrest thou a benefyce?
verily to live at thine own pleasure / not at Christ's. Thou have missed y^
mark which a christen man ought to have euerywher p^fixed before his eyes.
Thou take meat that thou myghtest be strong in thy body / and thou wylt
have thy body strong that thou myghtest be suffycient unto holy exercyses and
watch. thou have hit ye mark. But thou prouydest for health and good living
leest thou should be more yuell favored or deformed / leest thou should
not be strong enough unto bodily lust / thou have fallen from Christ making
unto the another god. The supersticious honoring of saints.
There be which honor certain saints with certain cyremonyes. One saluteth
Christofer Christofer.
every day / but not except he behold his image. whyther looks he? verily to
this point / he has borne him self in hand that he shall be all yt day sure
from yuel death. Another worshypeth one Rochus Rochus.
/ but why? because he byleueth that he will keep away ye pestylence from his
body. Another mo^bleth certain prayers to Barbara or George Barbara ^ George.
/ leest he should fall in to his enemies hands. This man fasteth to saint
Apolyne Appolyne^
leest his tethe should a^e. That man visyteth ye image of holy Job Job.
/ because he should be without scabbes. Some assygne and name certain porci^n
of their wynnyng to poor men / leest their merchau^dyse should perysshe by
ship wrake. A taper is light before saint Hierom Iherom.
to thentent that thing which is lost may be had again. In conclusyon after
this same manner look how many things be which we either favor or else love /
so many saints have we made governors of the same things / which same
saints be diverse in diverse natures: so yt Paul does the same thing among
the french men that Hieron does with our country men ye almayns / and
neither James nor Johan can do that thing in every where which they do in this
or yt place: which honoring of saints trewly / except it be referred from ye
respect of corporal co^modytes or inco^modytes unto Christ / is not for a
christen man / in so much yt it is not far from ye superstyciousnesse of
the^ which in time passed vowed ye tenth part of their goods to Hercules /
to thente^t they might wax rich / or a cock to Esculapius A cock to
Esculapius.
that they might be recovered of their diseases: or which sacrifyced a bull to
Neptunus A bull to Neptunus.
that they might have good passage by see and prosperous saylynge. The names be
changed / but verily they have both one end and intent. Thou prayest Thou
prayest for long life.
god that thou may not dye to soon / or while thou art young / and prayest
not rather that he would give to the a good mind that in what so ever place
death should come upon the he should not find the unprepared. Thou thynkest
not of chaungyng thy life / and prayest god thou myghtest not dye. what prayest
thou for than? certainly that thou might sin as long as is possible. Thou
desyrest richesse and can not use richesse / do not thou than desire thine
own confusyon. Thou desyrest health and canste not use health / is not now thy
honoring of god dishonoring of god. In this place I am sure some of our holy
men will cry out against me with open mouths / which think lucre to be to
ye honoring of god / and as ye same Paul says with certain sweet
benedictyons disceyue the minds of innocent persons while they obey and serve
their belly / and not Jesus Christ. Than will they say / forbyddest thou
worshypof saints in whom god is honored? They acco^pte the honoring of
saints for absolute pity.
I verily disprayse not the^ so greatly which do those things with certain
simple and childysshe superstycion for lack of instructyon or capacite of wit
/ as I do the^ which sekyng their own aduau^tage prayseth and magnifieth those
things for most great and perfyte holiness / which things peradventure be
tolerable and may be suffred^ and for their own profit and aduau^tage
cherisshe and maintain ye ignorance of the people which neither I my self do
dispyse / but I can not suffer yt they should acco^pte things to be highest
and most chief / which of the^ self be neither good nor bad / and those
thynged to be greatest and of most value which be smallest and of leest value.
I will praise it and be content that they desire health of Rochus whom they so
greatly honor / if they consecrate it unto Christ. But I will praise it more if
they would pray for nothing else but yt with the hate of vices the love of
virtues might be increased: and as touching to live or to dye let the^ put it
into the hands of god / and let them say with Paul / whether we live wheder
we dye / to god and at gods pleasure we live or dye. It shall be a perfyte
thing if they desire to be dissolved from ye body and to be with Christ: if
they put their glory and joy in diseases or sycknesse / in loss or other
domages of fortune / yt they might be accounted worthy which even in this
world should be like or confyrmable unto their heed. To do therefore such
manner of things is not so much to be rebuked as it is peryllous to abide
still and clean to them. I suffer infyrmyte and weakness / but with Paul I
show a more excellent way. If thou shalt examyne thy studyes and all thy acts
by this rule / and shalt not stand any where in mean things till thou come
even unto Christ / thou shalt neither go out of thy way at any time /
neither shalt do or suffer any thing in all thy life which shall not turn
and be unto the a matter of serving and honourynge god.

The fyfth rule. capi.xiij.
LEt us add also the fyfth rule as an ayder unto this foresaid fourth rule ^yte.
/ that thou put perfyte pity / that is to say the honoring of god in this
thing only / if thou shall enforce always from things visyble which almost
every one be imperfyte or else indifferent to ascend to things inuysible after
the diuysyon of a man above rehearsed. This precept is apertaynyng to y^ matter
so necessarily / that whether it be through negligence or for lack of knowledge
of it / the most part of christen men instead of true honourers of god are
but plain superstycious / and in all other things save in the name of christen
men only vary not greatly from the superstycion of the gentyles. (...).
Let us ymagyne therefore two worlds / the one intelligyble ye other visyble.
The intellygible which also we may call the angelycall world / wherein god is
with blessed minds. The visyble world / ye cyrcle of heaven / the planettes /
and sterres / with all that included is in them as the four elements. Than
let us ymagyne man as a certain third world / part taker of both ye other:
of ye visyble world if thou behold his body / of the inuysible world if thou
consider his soul. In y^ visyble world because we be but strangers we ought
never rest / but what thing so ever offreth it self to the sencyble powers /
that is to say to the five wits / yt must we under a certain apt comparyson
or simylitude aply to the angelycall world / or else (which is most
profitable) unto manners and to that part of man which is corespo^dent to ye
angelyke world / that is to say to the soul of man. what this visyble son
is in the visyble world yt is the divine mind The so^ the di^^^ mynde^^
/ that is to say god in y^ intelligyble world / and in that part of the
which is of that same nature / that is to say in the spyrit. Look what the
moon is in the visyble world / that in the inuysible world is ye
congregation of angels and of blessed souls called the tryumphant church /
and that in the is the spyryte. what so ever heuens above works in the earth
under them / that same does god in the soul. The son gothe down aryseth /
rages in heat / is temperate / quyckneth / brings forth / makes ripe /
draws to him / makes subtyle and thynne / purges / hardens / mollyfyeth /
illumyneth / clereth / cheryssheth and comfort. Therefore what so ever thou
beholdest in him / ye what so ever thou see in the gross part of this
world of the elements which many have separated from the heuens above and
cyrcles of the fyrmament. In conclusyon what so ever thou consydrest in the
grosser part of thy self / accustom to apply it to god and to the inuysible
porcyon of thy self. So shall it come to pass that what so ever thing shall
any where offer it self to any of the sensyble wits / that same thing shall
be to the an occasyon of pity The occasion of pity.
/ to honor god. when it delyteth thy corporal eyes as often as this visyble
son spredeth him self on the earth with new light / by and by call to
remembrance how great the pleasure is of the inhabytauntes of heaven / unto
whom the eternal son ever springs and aryseth / but never goth down.
How great are the joys of that pure mind whereupon ye light of god always
shyneth and casts his beams. Thus by occasion of the visyble creature pray
with the words of Paul / that he which commanded light to shine out of
darkness may shine in thy heart / to give light and knowledge of the glory of
god in the face of Jesus Christ. The glory of god appeared in the face of moses
/ but we behold the glory of god i^ the face of Jesus Christ.
Repete such like places of holy scripture in which here and there the grace
of the spyrite of god is compared to light. The grace of god is called light /
and night is compared to sin.
The night seems tedyous to the and dark / think on a soul destytute of the
light of god and dark with vices: ye and i^ thou can perceive any derknesse
of night in the / pray that the son of justice may arise unto the. This wise
think and surely believe that things inuysible which thou see not are so
excellent / so pure / so perfyt / that things which be seen in co^paryson of
them are scarce very shadows represe^tyng to the eyes a small and a thynne
simylytude of the^. Therefore in this outward corporal things what so ever
thy sensyble wits either desire or abhor / it shall be a great deal meter yt
the spyrit love or hate the same thing in inward and incorporall things. The
goodly beautye of thy body pleases thine eyes / think than how honest a thing
is the beauty of ye soul. what soever is perceived in the body that same is to
be understood in the ^^ynde.
A deformed vysage seems an vnplesau^t thing. remember how odyous a thing is
a mind defiled with vices: and of all other thyndo likewise. For as ye soul
has certain beauty wherewith one while she pleases god / and a defourmyte
wherewith an other while she pleases ye dyuell / as like unto like: so has she
also her youth / her age / sickness / health / death / life / poverty / riches /
joy / sorrow / werre / peace / cold / heat / thurst / drink / hunger /
meat. To conclude shortly what soever is fylthy in the body / that same is to
be understand in the soul. Therefore in this thing ^esteth the journey to the
spyrituall and pure life / if by a little and little we shall accustom to
withdraw our self from these things which be not trewly in very deed / but
partly apere to be that they be not: (...)
as fylthy and voluptuous pleasure / honor of this world partly vanysshe
away and haste to return to naught / and shall be rauysshed and carried to
these things which indede are eternal immutable and pure: which thing
Socrates saw full well / a philosopher not so much in tongue and words as in
living and deeds / for he says that so only shall the soul depart happily
from her body at the last end / if aforehad she have dyligently through true
knowledge recorded and practysed death / and also have long time before by the
dispysynge of things corporal / and by the contemplacyon and loving of
things spyrituall used her self to be as it were in a manner absent from the
body. (...) to the (...) of christ.
Neither the cross unto which Christ calls and exhorts us / neither that
death in which Paul wylleth us to dye with our heed / as also the prophet
says: for thy sake we be slain all the day long / we be accounted as sheep
appointed to be killed / neither that which the apostle writes in other
terms ^ayeng / seek those things that be above / not which be on the earth.
Taste and have perceyuaunce of things above / means it any other thing than
that we unto things corporal should be dull and made as though we were
insensyble and utterly without capacyte. So that the less felyng we have in
things of the body / so much the more swetnesse we might find in things
pertaining to the spyrite / and might begin to live so much the trewlyer
inwardely in the spyrite / the less we lived outwardly in the body. In
conclusyon to speak more plainly / so much the less should move us things
caduke and trausytory / the more acquaynted we were with things eternal. So
much the less should we regard the shadows of things the more we have
begone to look up upon the the very true things. This rule therefore must be
had ever ready at hand / that we in no wise stand still any where in temperall
things / but that we rise thence making as it were a step unto the love of
spyrituall things by matchyng the one with the other / or else in comparyson of
things which are inuysible that we begin to dispyse that which is visyble.
The disease of thy body will be the easier if thou would think it to be a
remedy for thy soul. Thou should care the less for the health of thy body
if thou would turn all thy care to defend and maintain the health of the
mind. The death of the body puts the in fear / the death of the soul is
much more to be feared. Thou abhorrest the poison which thou see with thine
eyes / because it brings myschefe to the body / much more is the poison to
be abhorred which s^eeth the soul. Cicuta is poison Cycuta is a poison e^be.
of ye body / but voluptuousness is much more and ready poison to the soul.
Thou quakest and tremblest for fear / thy here stands upright / thou art
spechelesse / thy spyrites forsaken the and thou waxest pale / fearing leest
the lyghtnynge which apereth out of the clouds should smite the / but how
much more is it to be feared leest there should come on the / the inuysybe
lyghtnyng of the wrath of god / which says: Go ye cursed persons in to
eternal fire. The beauty of the body rauyssheth the / why rather love thou
not ferue^tly that fayrnesse yt is not seen? Translate thy love in to that
beautye that is perpetual / that is celestyall / that is without corrupcyon /
and the discretelyer shalt thou love the ^aduke and tra^sytory shappe of the
body. Thou prayest that thy field may be watered with rain leest it dry up /
pray rather that god will vouchesaffe to water thy mind leest it wax barayne
from the ^^ute of virtues. The mystery in all things must be looked upon.
Thou restorest and encreasest again with great care the waste of thy money:
Holy scripture is sylenus of Alcybyades. Sylenus be images made with ^oyntes so
that they may be opened contayny^ge outward the symylitude of a (...) or an
ape or ^^che like try^els: and when they (...) opened suddenly appears some
excellent or m^ruaylous thing / unto such things ^^^biades a noble man of At
^^e^es compared the philosopher Soerates for socrates was so simple outward /
and so excellent inward.
the greatest care of al ought thou have to restore again the loss of the
mind. Thou have a respect long before hand to age / leest any thing should
be lackyng to thy body: and should thou not provide that nothing be lacking
to the mind. And this verily ought to be done in those things which daily
meteth our sensyble wits / and as every thing is of a diverse kind / even so
dyuersly does move us with hope / fear / love / hate / sorrow and joy. The
same thing must be observed and kept in all manner of lernyng which include
in them self a plain sense and a mystery / even as they were made of a body
and a soul / that the lyterall sense little regarded thou should look chefly
to y^ mystery: Of which manner are the letters of al poets and philosophers
chefly the folowers of Plato. But most of al holy scripture / which being in a
manner like to S^lenus of Alcibiades / under a rude and folysshe covering
include pure divine and godly things: for else if thou shall read without the
allegory the image of Adam formed of moist cley and the soul brethed into him
/ and Eve plucked out of the rybbe / how they were forbid the tree of knowledge
of good and yuell / the serpent entysynge to eat / god walking at the air:
when they knew they had sinned / how they hid them self / the angel set
at the doors with a turnynge sword leest after they were eiecte / the way to
them should be open to come again shortly. If thou should read the hole
history of the making of the world / if thou read (I say) superfycially
these things / seking no further than apereth outwardly / I can not perceive
what other great thing thou shall do than if thou should sing of the image of
cley made by Prometheus / or of fire stolen from heaven by subtyltie and put in
to the image to give life to ye cley. The fable of the gyauntes / A great
no^bre of gyauntes builded mountain upon mountain to pluck Iupyter out of
heaven / but Jupiter under mined their mountains and slew them with lyghtnynge.
ye peradventure a poets fable in the allegory shall be red with somewhat
more fruit than a narracyon of holy books / if thou rest in y^ rynde or utter
part. If wha^ thou redest the fable of the gyauntes / it warns and puts
the in remembrance that thou strive not with god and things more mighty than
thou / or that thou ought to abstain from such studyes as nature abhors
/ and that thou should set thy mind unto these things (if so be they be
honest) whereunto thou art most apt naturally: That thou tangle not thy self
with matrymony / if chastyte be more agreeable to thy manners. Again that thou
bind not thy self to chastyte if thou seem more apt to marriage. For most
comenly those things come yuell to pass which thou prouest against nature.
If the cup of Cyrces Circes was a woman which by enchantme^t turned men to
diverse fascio^s of beestes with poisons or dre^ches.
teach yt men with voluptuousness as with wytchecraft fall out of their mind
and be changed utterly fro me^ unto beestes. If thristy Tantalus Tantalus.
teach the that it is a very miserable thing for a man to sytte gapyng upon
his richesse heaped together and dare not use them. The stone of Siciphus
Sysyphus.
that ambycion is laborous and miserable. If the labors of Hercules The
labors of hercules.
puts the in remembrance that heaven must be obtained with honest labors
and enforcementes infatygable / lernest thou not that thing in the fable
which ye philosophers ^eache and also diuynes / masters of good lyui^g? But
if (without allegory without allegory s^rypture is baren.
) thou shalt ^ede the infauntes wrestlyng in their mothers belly /
thenherytaunce of the elder brother sold for a mess of potage / the blyssyng
of the father prevented and taken away by fraud. Goly smytten with the slynge
of Dauyd / and the here of Sampson shaven: it is not of so great valor as if
thou should read the feynynge of some poet. Many ungoodly things in
scripture as they appear outward.
what difference is there whether thou read the book of kings or of the judges
in the old testament / or else the history of Titus Liuyus / so thou have
respect to the allegorye in nere another? For in the one / that is to say Titus
Liuyus / be many things which would amend the comen manners: in the other be
some things / ye ungoodly as they seem at ye first lokyng on / which also if
they be understand superstycially should hurt good manners: As the theft of
Dauyd Dauyd committed adultery with Barsabe / and caused Urye her husband to
be slain.
/ and adultery bought with homycide / how the daughters of Lot lay with
their father by stelthe / and conceived / and a thousand other like matters.
Therefore the flesh of the scripture dispy^ed chefely of the old testament /
it shall be mete and convenient to search out the mystery of the spyrite. ^anna
to the shall have such taste as thou bring with the in thy mouth. But in
openyng of mysteries thou may not follow the co^iectures of thine own mind
The mysteries must be handeled with craft
/ but the rule must be known and a certain craft / which one Dion^sius
reaches in a book entytled De diuinis nominibus / that is to say / of the
names of god: and saint Augustyne in a certain warke called Doctrina
christiana / that is to say / the doctrine of a christen man. The apostle Paul
after Christ opened certain fountaynes of allegorye Allegory.
/ whom Origene followed / and in that part of diuynite obtained doutlesse the
chief room and maystry. But our diuynes Our diuynes.
either set naught by the allegory / or handle it very dremyngly and
vnfrutefully: yet are they in subtylty of disputacyon equal or rather
superyours to old diuynes.

But in treating of this craft that is to say in pure / apt / and fruitful
handlyng the allegorye not ones to be compared with them / and that specially
as I guess for two caused. The one that the mysterye can be but weak and
barayne that is not fortyfyed with strength of cloquence / and tempred with
certain swetnesse of speaking / in which our elders were passing excellent /
and we not ones taste of it. An other cause is / for they content with
Arystotle only Arystotle only is read now adays.
/ expel from schools the sect of Plato and Pic^agoras / and yet saint
Augustyn prefers these later / not only because they have many sentences
much agreeable to our relygyon / but also because the very manner of open and
clear speech / which they use (as I have said before) full of allegoryes /
draws very nygh to y^ style of holy scripture. No ^erua^le therefore though
they have more co^modyously handled the allegor^es of the word of god / which
with ple^tuous oracyon were able to increase and Old di^y^e^ with help of
eloquence handeled the Allegoryes well fauourdly
delate to color and garnysshe any manner thing never so baren / simple / or
homely / which men also being most expert and co^nyng of all antiquite had
practysed and exercysed long before in poets and books of Plato / y^ thing
which they should do after in divine mysteryes. I had lever that thou should
read the commentaries of those men / for I would instruct and induce the not
unto co^tencion of arguments / but rather unto a pure mind. But and if thou
can not attain the mystery / remember yet that some thing lies hyd which
though it be not known / yet verily to have trust to obtain it shall be
better than to rest in the letter which kylleth. And that se thou do not only
in the old testament / but also in the new. The gospel has her flesh The
gospel has her flesh and spyryte.
/ she has also her spyrite: for though the veil be pulled from y^ face of
Moses / nevertheless yet unto this day Paul says per speculum in enigmate
/ not the thing self and clearly / but the image or symylitude of the very
thing as it were in a glass vnper^ytely and obscurely: and as Christ him
self says in his gospel of Johan. The flesh profyteth nothing at all / it
is the spirit that gives life. I verily would have been afraid to have said
it profyteth not at all / it should have been enough to say the flesh profyteth
somewhat / but much more the spirit: but now verite himself has said it
profyteth not at all. And so greatly it profyteth not / that after the mind of
Paul it is but death / except it be referred to the spirit: yet at the leest
way in this thing is the flesh profitable for that she ledeth our infirmyty
as it were with certain greces or steps unto the spirit. The body without
the spirit can have no being: the spiryt of the body has no need. wherefore
if after the doctrine of Christ the spirit be so great and excellent a thing
/ that he only gives life: hither to this point must our journey be / that in all manner let^res / in all our acts we have respect to the spirit / and not to
the flesh. And if a man would take heed / he should soon perceive that this
thing only is it whereunto exhorts us among the prophets specially Esaias:
among thapostles Paul / which almost in every epistle plays this part and
cries that we should have no confydence in the flesh / and that in the
spirit is life / liberty / light / adopcion: and those noble (...) so greatly
to be desired which ^he (...). Adopcyon is inherytaunce / not by birth but by

brethren in the reioysyng of the ^ewes that they were the children of Abraham
/ in offryng of gifts in the temple / in praying / in delatyng of their
philateirs / and in many like places he despyseth the flesh of the law / and
supersticyon of them which had lever be jews openly in the sight of man than
pryuely in yt sight of god. Phy^arey^s were ^ apers which the pharysees ware on

And when he said to the woman of Samary / by leave me that y^ hour shall come
when ye shall honor the father neither in this mountain / neither in
Jerusalem: but the hour shall be and now is when the very true worshyppers
shall worship the father in spyryte and verite: for surely ye father requires
such to honor him. The father is a spirit / and they which honor him must
honor in spirit and verite. He signyfyed the same thing in deed when at the
marriage he (...) the water of the cold and vn^^^^ty let them to wine of the
spirit / ma^yng drunk the spiritu^^ souls / even unto the conie^^p^e and

(...) despised these things which now I have rehearsed / yea he despised the
eating of his own fle^he and drynkyng of his own blood / except it were
done spiritually. To whom think thou spoke he these things: the flesh
profyteth nothing at all / it is the spiryt that quyckneth and gives life?
verily not to them which with saint John's gospel Saint Ioha^s gospel ^^gyn^
at their (...)
/ or an agnus de^ hangyng about their necks think themself sure from al
manner of harm / and suppose that thing to be y^ very perfyte religion of a
christen man: but to them to wh^me he opened the high mystery of eating his
own body if so great a thing be of no valor / yea if it be per^ycyous or
perylous: what cause is there wherefore we should have co^fide^ce in any other
carnal things / except y^ spiryt be present? Thou peradue^tu^e say mass
daily and lyuest at thine own pleasure / and art not ones moved with thy
neighbors hurtes / no no more tha^ if they perteyned nothing at all to the:
thou art yet in the flesh of the sacrament^ but and if while thou say /
thou enforcest to be the very same thing which is signified by receyuyng that
sacrament / that is to say / to be one spiryt with the spiryt of Christ / to
be one body with the body of Christ / to be a quycke member of the church: if
thou love nothing but in Christ / if thou think all thy goods to be co^mun to
all men / if the inco^moditees of al men grieve the even as thine own: Than no
doubt thou say mass with great fruit / and that because thou do it
spiritually. If thou perceive that thou art in a manner tra^sfygured and
changed in to Christ / and that thou lyuest now less and less in thine own
self / give thanks to y^ spirit which only quyckeneth and gives life.
Many ben wont to nombre how many masses they have been at every day / and having
confydence in this thing as of most valor (as though now they were no farther
bound to Christ) as soon as they be departed out of y^ church return to
their old manners again / that they enbrace y^ flesh of pite / that is to say
of pure life or service of god I disprayse not: that they there stop I praise
not: let that be performed in the which is there represented to thine eyes.

is) in thy bosom how nygh thou art deed to the world. For if thou be possessed
ho^^y with wrath / ambicyon / couerousnes / envy / yea though thou touch y^
altar: yet art thou far from mass. Christ was slain for the / ^lee thou
therefore these beestes / sacrifise thy self to him which for thy sake
sacrifysed himself to his father: if thou ones think not on these things /
and have confidence in the other: god hates thy carnal and gross religion.
Thou art baptized / think not forth with y^ thou art a christen man / thy
mind all together sauoureth nothing but this world: thou art in ye sight of
the world a chryste^ man / but secret and before god thou art more hethen
tha^ any hethen man. why so? for thou have the body of the sacrament and art
without the spiryt which only profits. Thy body is washed / what matter
makes that while thy mind remains still defiled and inquinate. Thy body is
touched with salt / what tha^ wha^ thy mind is yet unsavory. Thy body is
anointed / but thy mind is vnanoynted. But if thou be buried with Christ
withinforth / and studyest to walk with him in the new life I than know the
for a chryste^ man. Thou art sprincled with holy water Sprynclynge of holy
water.
/ what good does that / if so be thou wype not away the inward fylth from
thy mind. Thou honor saints / and art joyous and glad to tostche their
relykes Touching of relykes.
/ but thou despysest the these relykes which they left behind them / that is
to be understand The true honoryng of saints
/ the examples of pure living. There is no honor more pleasant to Mary than
if thou sholdest cou^terfayte her humilite. No religion is more acceptable to
saints or more appropryate than if thou would labor to rep^sent and follow
their dercues wylt thou deserve the love and favor of Peter or of Paul /
counterfayte the ones faith / and the others charity / and thou shalt do a
greater thing than if thou sholdest (...) to Rome x. times. wylt thou worship
saint Fraunces singularly? thou art hye minded / thou art a great lou^s of
money / thou art stubburne and self wylled / full of co^tencyon / wise in
thine own opinion / give this to the saint / swage thy mind / and by the
example of saint Fraunces be more sobre / humble or meke / despise fylthy (...)
/ and be desirous of riches of the mind / put away stryuyng and debates with
thy neighbors and with goodness ouerco^me evil. The saint sets more by this
honor than if thou sholdest set before him a thousand breunynge tapers. Thou
thynkest it a special thing to be put in thy grave wrapped in the cowle or
habyte of say^^^ Frau^ces? Trust me like vesture shall profit the nothing at
all when thou art deed / if thy living and manners be found unlike when thou
were alive. And though the s^^e example of all true virtue and pure life /
showing how thou sholdest honor god in every thing is fette of Christ most
^^^modyously in such manner / that in no ^^yse thou can be deceived.
Nevertheless if the worshyppynge of Christ in his saints delight the so
greatly / se that thou counterfayte Christ in his saints Let us counterfeyt
Christ in his saints.
/ and for the honor of every saint look thou p^t away all vices / vice by
vice / so that thou sacryfyse to every saint syngularly some one vice
syngularly / or else study to enbrace and counterfayte some one syngular virtue
in every saint / such as thou perceyuest to have reigned most chefely in
every saint / syngularly of them which thou worshyppest so specially. If this
shall come to pass / than will I not reprove those things which be done

thy religyon preposterous and out of order Let us honor the quycke image of
Paul.
/ and according to the common proverb / the carte set before the horse?
Honor thou the bones of Paul hyd in the shryne / and honor thou not
the mind of Paul hyd in his wrytynges? Magnifiest thou a piece of his carkas
shynyng through a glass / and regardest not thou the hole mind of Paul
shynyng through his lettres? Thou worshyppest the ashes in whose p^sence now
and than the deformytees and diseases of bodies be taken away / why rather
honor thou not his doctrine / wherewith the deformytees and diseases of
souls are cured and remedyed? Let the unfaithful marvel at these miracles
and signs for whom they be wrought: but thou that art a faithful man enbrace
his books / that as thou doutest not / but that god can do all things / even
so thou myghtest learn to love him above all things. Thou honor the image
of the bodyly countenance of Christ formed in stone o^ tree The very image of
Christ is expressly painted in the gospel.
/ or else portrayed with colors: with much greater reverence is to be
honored the image of his mind Apelles was the most connyng paynter that ever
was
/ which by workmanshyp of the holy ghost is figured and expressed in the
gospels. Never any Apelles so expressly fascyoned with pensell the proporcio^s
and figure of the body as in the oracyon and doctrine of every man appears the
image of the mind / namely in Christ / which when he was very simplicite and
pure verit^ / no discord / no unlike thing at all could be between ye first
and chief pattern of his divine mind and the image of his doctrine and
^ernynge from thens deducte and deryuate / as nothing is more like the father
of heaven than his sone / which is y^ word / the wysdom and knowledge of the
father / spryngyng forth of his most secret heart: so is nothing more like
unto Christ than the word / the doctrine and ^echyng of Christ / given forth
out of ye preuy parts of his most holy breast: and ponderest thou not this

think heaven to be due / in which if they be ones roted at ones they think
themself Paul's and Antonyes. Paul and Antony were hermytes of passing holy
conuersacyon.
They begin O good lord / with what gra^ytye / with how great authorite to

says Ierens) So that they think nothing well done but y^ they do them self.
The de^enders of ceremonies
But for all that when they be wexen old syres in their manner of living thou
shalt se y^ as yet they savor or ^ast^ of Christ nothing at all: but to be
beestly swimming in certain chorlysshe vices in their living and pastyme
froward / and scarce can suffer and forbear their own self: in charity
cold: in wrath fervent: in hate as ^ough as white lether: in their tongues be
nymous and full of poison: in exercysynge and purtyng forth of their malice
co^querours and not able to be ouerco^me: ready to strive for every little
tryste: and so far from the perfection of Christ / that they be not ones
(...) with these common virtues / which the (...) or hethen men have learned /
either by reason given (...) them of nature / (...) by use of (...) / or by the
precepts of philosophers. Thou shall also se them in spirytuall things clean
without capacite / fyerse that no man shall know how to ^^^^eate or handell
them / full of strife and contencyon / gredy upon volup^^ous pleasure / at the
word of god ready to s^ewe / kind to no man / mysdemynge other men /
flaterynge their own selves. It is come to this point now at last with the
labors of so many years / that thou sholdest be of all men the worste / and
yet think thy self the best: that instead of a chryste^ man thou sholdest be
but a plain ^ewe / obseruyng only vnfruytfull tradicyons and ceremonies of
the inuencyons of man / that thou sholdest have thy glory and joy / no^ in
secret before god / but openly before the world? But and if thou have walked
in the spirit and no^ in the flesh: where be the fruytes of the spirit?
where is charity? where is that cherefulnesse or joyous myrthe of a pure mind?
where is tranquillite and peace toward all men? where is pacyence? where is
perseuerau^ce of soft mind / wherewith thou lokest day by day contynually for
the amendment even of thine enemies: where is curtesy or gentylnesse / where
is frenesse of heart / where is mekenes / fidelite / discrecio^ / measure or
sobrenesse / temperaunce and chastity / where is the image of Christ in thy
manners? I am say thou no keeper of hores / no these / no violatour of holy
things / I keep my professyon. But what other thing is this to say than I am
not like other men The ypocrysye of relygyous persone^.
/ extorcioners / adulterers / ye and I fast twyse in a weke: I had lever have
a publicane humble and lowly asking mercy than this kind of pharysees
rehersynge their good deeds. But what is thy professyon? is it I pray the that
thou sholdest not perform that thing thou promised long ago when thou were
baptized / which was that thou would be a christen man / that is to say / a
spiritual person / and not a carnal ^ewe? which for ye tradicyons of man
sholdest transgress the commandments of god Is not the life of a chryste^
man spiritual? Here Paul spekyng to ye Romans. No ^ampnacion is to them that
are graffed in Christ Jesus / which walk not carnally or after the flesh: for
the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has delivered me from the law
of sin and death: for yt which the law weyked by reason of the flesh could
not perform or make good / yt same god made good / sendynge his sone in the
similitude of flesh prone to sin / and of sin conde^pned sin in the
flesh / that the iustyfyeng of the law might be fulfilled in us which walk
not after ye flesh but after the spiryt: for they that be in the flesh / be
wise in things perteynyng to the flesh: but they which be in the spiryt
perceive those things that perteyne to the spirit: for wysdom of the flesh
is death / and wysdom of the spiryt is life and peace: for the wysdom of the
flesh is an ennemy to god because she is not obedient to the law of god /
nor yet can be. They yt be i^ the flesh they can not please god: what could
be spoken more largely? what more plainly: nevertheless many men subtyle and
crafty to flater or favor their own vices: but prone and ready without
aduysement to check other men's The exposycio^ and mind of some clerks.
/ think these things to perteyne to themself nothing at all: and that
Paul spoke of walkyng carnally or after the flesh / they refer to adulters
only and kepers of queen's: that he spoke of wisdom of the flesh which is
enemy to god / they turned it to them which have learned humanite / or that
they call secular scyences: in either other they set up their creestes / and
clap their hands for joy / both that they neither be adulters / and in all
sciences stark^ fools. More over to live in the spyryte they dreme to be none
other thing tha^ to do as they them selves do: The flesh and the spyryte
after Poule.
which persons if they would as diligently observe y^ ^onge of Paul as they
maliciously despise Tullys / they should soon perceive y^ the apostle calls
the flesh that thing y^ is visyble and the spyryte that thing that is
inuisyble: for he techeth every where that things visyble ought to serve to
things inuisyble: and not contrary wise inuysyble things to serve things
vysyble: thou of a preposterous order applyest Christ to those things which
were mete to be applied unto Christ: requyrest thou of me record that this
word flesh perteyneth not only to fylthy and superfluous lust of the body?
hold and understand that thing which the said apostle (doing that same
which he in all places does) writes to the Colocenses. Let no man mysleade you
for ye nones in the humilite and religyon of aungelles which things he never
saw walkyng in vain / inflate with the ymaginacion of the flesh / and not
holdyng the heed / that is to say Christ / of whom all the body by couples
and joints mynystred up and co^pacte grows in to the increase of god / and
leest thou sholdest doubt any thing y^ he spoke of them which having
co^fide^ce in certain corporal ceremonies ^arke against y^ spu^al purposes of
other men^ take heed what follows: if ye be deed with Christ / ab e^e me^^s
huius mu^di / from tradicyons / ceremonies and inue^cions of men: why have ye
yet such decrees among you / as though ye lived unto the world. And anon
after calling us from the same things says: if ye be risen up again with
Christ / seek those things yt are above where Christ sytteth on ye right
hand of god. Be expert and wise in those things that be above / and not on
the earth. More over gyuyng p^ceptes of ye spu^all life / what exhorts he us
to do at the last / whether yt we should use such or such ceremonies: whether
yt we should be this or that wise arrayed / that we should live with this or yt
meats / that we should say customably any certain nombre of psalms: he made
mention of no such things: what than? Mortyfy the members on the earth.
Mortifye (said he) your me^bres which be on ye earth / fornicacyon / uncleanness
/ bodyly lust / evil concupiscence / and auaryce which is y^ service of ydols:
and a little after that now put from you al such things / wrath / indignacyon
/ malice: and again / spoylyng your self of the old man with all his acts
puttyng on you the new man which is renewed i^ knowledge of god after ye image
of him which made him. But who is the old man? The old man
verily Adam / he that was made of the earth / whose co^uersacyon is in earth /
not in heaven. By the earth understand what so ever is vysyble / and therefore
temporal and transytory. who is that new man? verily the celestyall man that
descended from heaven Christ. And by heaven understand what so ever is
inuysyble / and therefore eternal and everlasting. At the last leest we should
be minded to purchase the favor of god after the manner of the jews with
certain obseruaunces / as ceremonies magical / he techeth that our deeds are
pleasant and allowed of god / so long as they are referred unto charity / and
also spring thereof / saying. Above all these things keep charity the bond
of perfection / and let the peace of god rejoice as a victor in your hertes / in
which also ye be called in one body. I will give the a more plain token and
euydent probacyon that this word flesh signyfyeth not the lust of the body
only. Paul names often the flesh / often the spirit / writing to a
certain people named Galatas / which he called not only from lust of the body
to chaste living but enforces to withdraw them from the sect of of the jews
and confydence of work in to which they were enduced by false apostles. In
this place therefore no^brynge the deeds of the flesh / mark what vices he
reherseth. The deeds of ye flesh (says he) be manifest / which are
fornycacyon / uncleanliness / to be shameless / lechery / worshyppynge of ydolles
/ wytchcrafte / preuy hate / discord / otherwise called co^tencion or strife /
emulacyon that may be called in dignacyon or disdain / ire otherwise called
wrath / scolding discencyon / that is to say / dyuersite in maynteynynge of
opinyons / sects / or maynteynynge of quarelles / envy / homycyde /
drunkenness / excess in eating / and such like. And not long after he
says: Uayne glory is a pestylence contrary to the spyryte.
if we live in the spirit / let us walk in the spirit. After that as
declarynge and vtterynge a pestylence contrary to the spyryte / he adds: let
us not be made desirous of vain glory / prouokyng one the other / and enuyenge
one an other. The tree is known by the fruit. That thou omyttest not watch /
fasting / silence / orysons / and such other like obseruau^ces / I pass not
thereon / I will not believe that thou art in the spirit except I may se the
fruytes of the spirit. why may I not affirm the to be in the flesh when
after almoost a hondreth years exercise of these things / yet in the I find
the deeds of the flesh / enuyousnes more than is in any woman / contynuall
wrath and fyersnes: as in a man of war / scolding / (...) and pleasure
insaciable / malycyous cursyng / backbytyng with tongue more venyi^ous than the
poison of a serpent / an high mind / stubburnes / light of thy promise /
vanite / faynyng / flaterynge? thou iudgest thy brother i^ his meat / drink
or rayme^t but Paul judges the of thy deeds: does that separate the from
worldly and carnal men / that thou art i^ lyghter causes verily but yet with
the same vices infected? is he more fylthy / which for his inheritance taken
from him or it came to his hands: for his daughter defiled / for hurt done to
his father / for some office / for his princes favor: co^ceyueth wrath /
hatred: emulacion (which may be called indignacion or disdain) tha^ thou
which (I am ashamed to tell) for how little a tryfle / yea for nothing do all the same things much more malycyously / the lyghter occasyon to sin
lyghteth not / but aggrauateth the sin / neither it makes matter in how
little or great a thing thou sin / so it be done with like affection: and
yet is there difference verily: for so much the greuouser does every man
trespace / the less ye occasyon is wherewith he is pulled away from honest. I
speak not now of those monks Monks.
or relygious persons whose manners even the hole world abhorteth / but of the^
whom the co^mun people honors not as me^ / but as angels / which self same
notwithstanding ought not to be displeased with these words / which rebukes
ye vices and notes not the persons: but and if they be good men / let them
also be glad to be warned of what so ever man it be / in those things which
perteyneth to health: neither it is unknown to me that among them are very
many which helped with lernyng and wit have tasted the mysteryes of the
spirit (but as Liuius says) it fortuneth almoost every where: that the
greater part overcomes the better. Notwithstanding (if it be law full to
confess the troth) se we not all the most strayte kind of monks to put the
chief point of relygyon either in ceremonies or in a certain manner or form
of saying / that they call their dyuyne service / or in a labor of the body /
which monks if a man should examyne and appose of spiritual things / he
should scarce find any at all that walked not in the flesh. And here of
comes this so great infyrmytye of minds / trembling for fear where is no
fear / and therein suertye and careless where is most peril of all: here of
comes the perpetual infancye in Christ (to speak no greuouslyer) that we
preposterous Preposterous is setting behynd that that should be before
estemers of things make most of such things which by them self are of no
value: those set at naught which only are suffycyent / ever living under
tuters or scholemaysters / ever in bondage / never aduaunsynge our self up to
the lyberty of the spirit / never growing up to the large stature of charity:
when Paul cries to a certain people called Galathas / stand fast / be not ye
locked again under the yoke of bondage. And in an other place the law was our
tutor or scholemayster in Christ / that of faith we should be iustyfyed. But
seeing that faith is come / now we be no more under a tutor or scholemayster:
for every one of you (says he) is the very sone of god through faith which
he has in Christ Jesus. And not much after he says / and we also when we
were little ones were in service and bondage under the ceremonies and law of
this world. But when the time was fully expyred / god sent his sone made of a
woman / made under the law to redeem them which were under the law / that we
by adopcyon should be his sons. And for because ye be the sons of god / god
has sent the spirit of his sone in to your hertes / cryeng Abba pater (as a
man would say dade father) And so is he not now a servant / but a sone to
god. And again in an other place. Brethren ye be called in to lybertye / let
not your lybertye be an occasyon unto you to live in the flesh / but in
charity of the spirit serve one an other: for all the law is fulfilled in one
saying. Love thy neighbor as thy self / but and if ye byte and eat one the
other / take heed leest ye be consumed one of an other. And again to the
Romans. ye have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear / but the
spirit that makes you the sons of god by adopcion / in whom we cry dade
father. Unto the same also perteyneth that he writes to Timothe / saying.
Exercise thy self under the deeds of pite: for bodyly exercise is good but for
a small thing / pite is good unto all manner things. And to the Corynthes. God
is a spirit / and where the spirit is / there is lyberty. But why rehearse I
one or two places / when Paul is all together at this point / that the flesh
which is full of contencyon should be despised / and that he might settle us
in the spirit which is the author of charity and lybertye. For these
companyons be ever inseparable on the one side / the flesh / bondage /
unquietness / contencyon or strife. And on the other side the spyryte / peace /
love / lybertye. These things every where Paul mengleth with other sayings.
And seek we a better master of our relygyon / namely when all dyuyne scripture
agrees to him? This was the greatest commandment in the law of Moses. This
Christ iterateth and fynyssheth in the gospel: and for this cause chefely was
he borne: To love is the gretest commandment.
for this cause dyed he to teache us not to cou^terfayte the jews / but to
love. After the last souper made the even before his passion / how diligently /
how tenderly / and how affectuously gave he charge to his discyples / not of
meat / not of drink / but of charity to be kept one toward an other:
Christ last of all warns us of charity.
what other thing techeth he / what other thing desires his discyple. Johan
than that we love one an other. Paul every where (as I have said) commends
charity / but specially writing unto the Corynthes he prefers charity both
before miracles and prophecyes / and also before the tongues of angels. And say
not thou by and by that charity is / to be often at the church / to croche down
before the images of saints / to light tapers or wax candels / to say many
lady psalters or saint Katherynes knottes. God has no need of these things.
what is true charity.
Paul calls charity to edyfye thy neighbor / to compte that we all be
members of one body / to think that we al are but one in Christ / to rejoice in
god of thy neighbors welthe even as thou do of thine own. To remedy his
inco^moditees or losses as ^hyne own. if any brother err or go out of the
right way / to warn him / to monysshe him / to tell him his fault mekely /
sobrely and curteysly / to teache the ignorant: to lift up him that is fallen:
to comfort and courage him that is in heaviness: to help him that labors /
to socour ye nedy. In co^clusyon to refer all riches and substance / al thy
study / all thy cares to this point / that thou in Christ sholdest help as
much as thy power extends to. That as he neither was borne for himself /
nor lived to his own pleasure / neither dyed for himself but dedycate him
self hoolly to our profytes. Even so should we apply our self / and awayte
upon the co^modytees of our brethren / and not our own: which thing if it
were used / nothing should be either more pleasant or else easy than the life
of religyous persons / which we se now clean contrary The life of relygyous
me^ is grievous and tedyous.
/ grievous almoost every where and laboryous / and also full of superstycyon /
like unto the jews / neither pure from any vices of the lay people / and in
many sundry things much more defiled / which kind of men saint Augustyne
Saint Augustyne would (...) know monks and (...) of his own relygyon if he
were now ^lyue.
(of whom many glory and rejoice as of the author and founder of their
living ^ if he now might live again / certainly would not ones know / and
would cry out / saying that he would approve nothing less than this kind of
life / and that he had instytuted an order and manner of living / not after the
supersticyon of the jews / but after the rule of the apostles. But I hear
even now what certain men (which are somewhat well advised) will answer unto
me. A man must take heed in little and small things / leest a little and a
little he should fall in to greater vices / I hear it right well / and I allow
the saying / nevertheless thou ought to take heed a great deal more that
thou so cleue not to these little and small things that thou sholdest fall
clean from the most chief and greatest things. How farforth we ought to clean
to the small things.
There is the ieopardye more euydent / but here more greuouse. So flee Scilla
that thou fall not into Charibdis. Scilla and charibdys look what they mean at
the end of the first chapter.
To observe these little things is wholesome verily: but to cleue utterly unto
them is very ieopardous. Paul forbids not the to use the law and
ceremonies / but he will not him to be bound to the law and ceremonies which
is free in Christ: he condempneth not the law of deeds / if a man use it
lawfully / without these things peradventure thou shalt not be a chryste^ man
/ but they make the not a chryste^ man (...)
/ they will help unto pite and godlynes / even so yet if thou use them for
that purpose. But and if thou shalt begin to enjoy them / to put thy trust
and confidence in them / at ones they utterly destroy all the living of a
christen man. Uyctym^ was the sacryfyce of a be where of he that offered
dydcate part / and part went to thuse of the priests the call the kydneis
and the fat about them was burned to god / that same sacryfyce for certain
co^syde racyons is also called hostia.
The apostle sets naught by the deeds of Abraham / which to have been very
perfyte no man doubts: and have thou confidence in thine. God disdeyneth
certain sacrifices called victime / the sabbottes and certain holy days
called Neomenye of his people the jews / of which things he himself was
author and co^mau^der / and dare thou compare thine own obseruau^ces with
the precepts of the law of god? yet here god ready to spue at them and agreued
with them For what intent (says he) offer ye to me the multitude of victimes /
I am full. As for holocaustes of wethers Holocaustes that is the hole be
sacryfysed to god^ no man having part thereof
/ talowe or inward suet and fat of beestes / blood of calves / of lambs
and gotes I would not have / when ye come before my presence who has required
these things of your hands that ye might walk in my houses Offer ye no more
sacryfyce in vain / your ensence is abhomynacyon to me Sabbot day was every
seventh day as our sunday.
/ I will not suffer any more the feast of the Neomenye and sabbot day / with
other feast days. Neomenye were holidays at the new of the moon.
The companies of you are infected with iniquite / my soul has hated your
kalendas and your solemn feestes. Kalendas that same that neomenyes be.
These things be grievous unto me / I was even sick to abide them. And when ye
put forth your hands / I will turn mine eyes from you: when he reherseth the
obseruaunces and manners of holy feestes and sacrifyce: more over the
multyplyenge of prayers / notes he not them as though he poynted them with his
finger / which measure their relygyon with a certain nombre of psalms and
prayers / which they call daily service. Mark also an other thing how
meruaylously the facundyous prophet expresses hepyng together the disdain or
i^dignacion of god: Esayas.
so that he now could suffer neither with ears neither eyes. what things (I
beseech the)? verily tho things which he himself had ordained to be kept so
religyously / which also were observed so reuere^tly so many years of holy
kings and prophets. And these things abhors he as yet in ye carnal law.
And trustest thou i^ ceremonies made at home in thine own house / now in the
law of the spiryt? God in an other place byddeth the same prophet to cry
incessantly and to put out his breast after the manner of a trumpe / as in an
ernest matter and worthy to be rebuked sharply / and such a man as uneath could
be opteyned of these men but with much ado. Me (says he) they seek from day
to day / and know they will my ways / as a people that has done justice / and
has not forsaken ye judgment of their god. They ask me for ye judgments of
justice / and desire to draw nygh to god: why have we fasted (say they) and
thou have not looked upon us and meked our souls / and thou would not know
it: lo in ye day of your fast (answers the prophet) your own will is
found in you / and ye seek out all your detters / loo unto strife and
contencyon ye fast / and ye smite with your fyst cruelly / fast ye not as ye
have fasted unto this day / that your cry might be herd on high. Is this the
fast that I have chosen / that a man should vex and trouble himself for one
day / either that a man should bow down his heed as a hoke or cyrcle / and
to straw underneath him sack cloth and ashes: will thou call this a fast
or a day acceptable unto god? But what shall we say this to be: does god
condemn that thing / which he him self commanded? Nay forsothe. what
than? But to cleue and stycke fast in the flesh of the law / and to have
confidence of a thing of nothing that is it verily which he hates deedly.
Therefore he shows that he would have added in either place. Be ye washed
(said he) and made clean / take away your evil cogitacyons and thoughts out of
my sight: when thou hear the evil thoughts rehearsed / touches he not
euyde^tly the spirit and the inward man. The eyes of god sees not outward /
but in secret / neither he judges after the sight of the eyes / neither
rebukes after the hearing of the ears. God knows not y^ folysshe virgyns
smothe and gay outward / empty of good works inward: he knows not them
which say with lyppes Master master. More over he puts us in
remembrance yt the use of y^ spu^all life stands not so greatly in
ceremonies as in ye charity of thy neighbor. The use of spirytuall life.
Seek (says he) judgment or justice / socour him that is oppressed / give
true judgment and right to him that is fatherles and motherles or frendles /
defend the wydowe / such like things did he knyt to the other place / where
he speaks of fasting. Is not this rather (says he) that fast I have chosen
Esayas.
/ loose or cancel cruel oblygacyons / unbind the burdens which make them

observe them as things necessary / but and if he be strong and perfyte so
much the rather shall he observe them / leest with his knowledge he should

Christ dyed: we may not omytte these things / but of necessyte we must do
other things. Corporal deeds be not condemned / but spyrituall are
preferred. This visyble honoring of god is not condemned / but god is not
pleased saving with inuysible pytie and service. God is a spyrit and is moved
and styrred with inuysible sacryfyce. It is a great shame for christen men not
to know that thing which a certain poet being a gentyle knew right well /
which gyuyng a pre^^pt of dew serving god says: If god (...) a mind as
scripture shows us / se (...) at thou honor him chefely with a pure ^^^ynde.
Let us not dispyse the auctour be^^g either an hethen man or without de^e of
schole / the sentence becomes ye a ^^^ght great divine: and (as I very well
^^ue perceived) is likewise understand (...) few / as it is read of many.
The intel^^ctyon of the sentence verily is this / like ^^ioysen with like. Thou
thynkest god to (...) moved greatly with an ox killed and ^^cryfyced / or with
the vapoure or smoke of frankensence / as though he were a body. God is a mind
/ and verily mind most pure / most subtyle and perfyte / therefore ought he to
be honored most chefely with a pure mind. Thou thynkest that a ^a^re lyghted
is sacrifyce / but a sacryfyce to god (says David) is a woeful or a sorrowful
spyrite. (...)
And though he has dispysed the blood of gotes and calves / yet will not he
dispyse a heart contryte and humble. If thou do that thing which is given to
the eyes of men / much rather take heed y^ thing not to be away which the
eyes of god require. Thy body is covered with a coule or habyte / what is that
to the purpose if thy mind bear a seculer (...) If thy utter man be cloked in
a cloak white as snow / let the ^este me^tes of thy inner manner be white as
snow also agreeable to the same. Thou kepest silence outward / much more
procu^e that thy mind be quiet within. In ye visyble temple thou bowest down
the knees of thy body: that is nothing worthy if in the temple of thy breast
thou stand upright against god. Thou honor the tree of the cross / much
more follow the mystery of the cross. Thou kepest the fasting day and
abs^eynest from those things which defyle not a man: and why absteynest thou
not from fytthy talkyng / which polluteth thine own conseyence and other men's
also. Meat is withdrawn from ye body / but why glutteth thy soul her self
with coddes of beenes / peson / and such like which are meat mete for swyne.
Thou make the church of stone gay with goodly orname^tes / thou honor
holy places: what is yt to the purpose if the temple of thy heart / whose walls
ye prophet. Ezechyell bored through be propha^at or polluted with the
abhomynacio^s of Egypt. Thou kepest the sabbot day outward / and within all
things be vnquier through ye rage and to^bling of vices togider. The sabot day
the day of rest.
Thy body co^mytteth no adultry / but thou art couerous: now is thy mind a
fornycatour. Thou syngest or prayest with thy bodily tongue / but take heed with
in what thy mind says. with thy mouth thou blyssest / and with thy heart thou
cursest. In thy body thou art closed within a strayte celle / and in thy
cogytacion thou wa^drest throughout all the world. Thou herest the word of
god with thy corporal ears / rather here it within. what says the prophet?
Except ye here within / your soul shall mourn and weep. ye and what redest
thou in the gospel: that when they se they should not se / and when they here
they should not here. And again the prophet says / with your ear ye shall
here and ye shall not perceive: blyssed be they therefore which here the word
of god within. Happy are they to whom god speaks within / and their souls
shall be saved. This ear to enclyne is commanded / that noble daughter of the
king whose beaurye and goodlynesse is all together within in golden hemmes.
Finally what avails it if thou do not those yuell things outward / which
with affection thou desyrest and coueytest inward. what avails it to do good
deeds outward / unto which within are committed things clean contrary. Is it
so great a thing if thou go to Jerusalem in thy body / when within thine own
self is both Sodom / Egypt / and Babylon. It is no great thing to have
trodden ye steps of Christ with thy bodyly heles Pylgrymages unto holy plac^
/ but it is a great thing to follow the steps of Christ in affectyon. If it
be a very great thing to have touched the sepulcre of Christ / shall it not be
also a very great thing to have expressed the mystery of his buryeng. Thou
accusest and vtterest thy sins to a priest Confession.
/ which is a man: take heed how thou accusest and vtterest them before god /
for to accuse them before him is to hate the^ inwardly. Thou byleuest perchance
all thy sins and offenses to be washed away at ones with a little paper or
parchement sealed with wexe / with a little money or images of wexe offered /
with a little pilgrimage going. Thou art utterly disceyued and clean out of
the way. The wound is received inwardly / the medycyne therefore must needs be
laid to within: thine affectyon is corrupt / thou have loved that which was
worthy of hate / and hated yt which ought to have been beloved. Sweet was to the
sower / and bitter was sweet. I regard not what thou show outward: but and
if clean contrary thou shalt begin to hate / to fly / to abhor that
which thou lately louedest / if y^ wax sweet to thine appetyte which lately
had the taste of ^all: of this wise at y^ last I perceive and take a token of
health. Magdalayne loved much / and many sins were forgyuen her. The more
thou love Christ / y^ more thou shalt hate vices: for y^ hate of fynne
follows the love of pytie as y^ shadow follows the body. I had lever have
the hate ones thy vycious manners within and in deed / than to defye the^ before
a priest ten times i^ word. Therefore (as I have rehearsed certain things for
love of ensample) in the hole spectacle and sight of this vysyble world In all
besynes the spyryte is within.
/ in the old law / in y^ new law / in all the commandments of the
church / finally in thy self and in all business apertayning to man without
forth / is there a certain flessh / and within a spyrit. In which things if
we shall not make a p^posterous order / neither in things which are seen shall
put very great co^fydence what things follow cheryte.
/ but even as they do help to better things / and shall always have respect
to ye spyrit to things of charity: than shall we wax not heavy as men in sorrow
and pain (as those men be) not feeble / ever children (as it is a proverb) not
beestly and dry bones (as says the prophet) without life / drousye and
forgetful as men diseased of ye lethargy / not dull having no quycknesse / not
brawlers and scolders / not enuyous and whyspera^s or dackbyters / but
excellent in Christ / large in charity / strong and stable both in
prosperyte and aduersyte Prosperyte ^ aduersyte
/ loking beside small things and enforsyng up to things of most profit /
full of myrthe / full also of knowledge: which knowledge who so ever refuses
them does that noble lord of all knowledge refuse. For verily ignorance or
lack of experyence / whom for the most part accompanyeth dullness of
lernyng / and that gentle woman whom the greeks call Philancia / yt is to say
love of thy self / only bri^geth to pass (as Esayas says) that we put
confyde^ce in things of nothing / and speak vanytes / yt we conceive labor
and bring forth iniquyte / and that we always be fearful and vile bond
servants unto the cyremones of ye jews. Of which manner persons Paul spekyng
says / I bear the^ record that the zele of god they have / but not after
knowledge. Christ is the end of the law
But what knew they not? verily y^ the end of the law is Christ / and Christ
verily is a spyrite / he is also charity. But Esayas more plainly discrybeth
the miserable and unprofitable bondage of these men in the flesh: Therefore
says he my people be led in captiuyte because they had no knowledge / and
the nobles of them perisshed for hunger / and the moultytude of them dried away
for thirst. It is no marvel that the comen people be servants to the law
and princyples of this world / as they which are unlearned / neither have
wisdom more than they borow of other me^nes heedes: it is more to be meruayled
that they which are as chief of Christ's relygyon / in the same captyuyte
perysshe for hunger / and wydder away for thurst. why perysshe they for hunger?
Because they have not learned of Christ to break barley loves / they only lycke
round about the rough and sharp codde or husk / they suck out no mary or
sweet lycoure. And why wydder they so away for thurst? for because they have
not learned of Moses to ^ette water out of the spyrituall rock of stone /
neither have drunk of the ryuers of the water of life which flows / issues
/ or springs out of the belly of Christ: and that was spoken verily of the
spyrit / not of the flesh. Thou therefore my brother / leest with sorrowful
labors thou should not much p^uayle / but that with mean exercise
myghtest shortly wax bygge in Christ and lusty / dyligently enbrace this
rule / and crepe not always on the ground with the unclean beestes / but
always sustained with those wings which Plato believes to spring ever a
fresshe / through the heat of love in the mind of men. By the wyn^ges of love
we must fly up to the spyryte
Lift up thy self as it were with certain steps of the ladder of Jacob /
from the body to the spyrit / from ye visyble world unto the inuysible / from
the letter to the mystery / from things sencyble to things intellygible /
from things gross and compounde unto things syngle and pure. who so ever
after this manner shall approach and draw nere to the lord / the lord of his
part shall again approach and draw nyghe to him. And if thou for thy part
shalt endeuoyre to arise out of the darkness and troubles of the sensual
powers / he will come against the plesauntly and for thy profit / out of his
light inaccessyble / and out of that noble scyle^ce incogytable: Incessable /
is to understand that no man can attain. Incogytable that can not be
comprehended with man's reason.
In which not only all rage of sensual powers / but also simylytudes or
ymagynacions of all the intellygyble powers does cease and keep scylence.

The syxth rule. capi.xiiij.
ANd for as much as in sodayn writing / one thing calls another to
remembrance / I will now add the syxth rule / which is in a manner of kynrede
to them that go before: a rule for all men as necessary unto health as it is of
few regarded. That rule is thus / that the mind of him which enforseth and
labors to Christ ward Thou must vary from the common people
/ vary as much as is possible both from the deeds and also opynyons of the
comen ley people / and that thensample of pity be not fet of any other save of
Christ only: The ensample of pity.
for he is the only chief patron / the only and chief ensample or form of
living / from whom who so ever wrieth one ynche or nail bread / goth besides
the right pathe and rometh out of the way. wherefore Plato with grauyte verily
as he does many things in his books of the governance of a cite or comen
welthe / denies any man to be able to defend virtue constantly which has
not instructed his mind with sure and undoubted opinyons of filthynesse and of
honesty. But how much more peryllous is it if false opinyons of the things
which pertayne to health should synke in to the deep botome of thy mind. For
that consyderacion therefore he thinks that this thing should be cared for and
looked upon chefely / that the governors them self whom it behooves to lack
all manner of vnclenlynesse / grave in their own minds very good opinyons of
things to be ensued and eschewed / that is to say of good and yuell / of vices
and of virtues / and that they have the^ very assured / all doubt laid aparte
as certain laws very holy and goodly: for what so ever thing clea^eth in the
mind surely roted with steadfast believe / that every man declares in his
manners and conuersacyon. Therefore the chief care of christen men ought to be
applied to this point The bringyng up of christen men's children
/ that their children straight way from the cradle / amongst the very
flatterynges of the norises / whiles the father and mother kiss the^ / may
receive and suck under the hands of them which are learned / opynyons and
perswasyons mete and worthy of Christ: because that nothing either synketh
deper or cleaves faster in the mind than that which (as Fabyus says) in
the young and tender years is poured in. Let be a far of from y^ ears of
little bodies wanton songs of love / which christen men sing at whom and
where soever they ride or go / much more fylthy than ever the comen people of
y^ hethen men would suffer to be had in use. Let them not here their mother
wayle and wring her hands for a little loss of worldly goods / nor for the
loss of her suster let the^ here her cry out alas that ever she was borne /
seeing that she is but a wretch a woman lost or cast away / left alone
desolate and destytute. Let not them here their father rebukynge and vpbraydyng
him of cowarnesse which has not reco^pensed injury or wrong with double:
neither yet lauding them which have gathered together great habundau^ce of
worldly substance / by what soever manner it were. The disposycion of man is
frail and prone to vices / he catches mischeuous ensample at ones: none
otherwise than thou catchest fire if it be put to. How be it this self same
thing is to be done in every age / that all the errors of the ley people
might be plucked out again from the mind by the hard roots / and in their
places might be planted wholesome opinyons / and so might be roborate yt with no
vyolence they could be shaken or plucked a sondre / which thing who soever
has done shall easily and without business by his own accord follow virtue
Virtue is the knowledge of things to be avoided and of things to be desired
and loved.
/ and shall account them that do otherwise worthy to be lamented and pityed /
and not to be counterfayte or followed. Unto this thing pertayneth that not
indiscreet saying of Socrates (though it were rebuked of Arystotle) that
virtue was nothing else but the knowledge of things to be ensued and followed /
and of things to be eschewed or fled: not but that Socrates saw y^
difference between knowledge of honesty and the love of the same. But as
Demosthenes answered pronuncy a^ion to be the first / the second / and also
the third point of eloquence / signyfyeng that to be y^ chief part / in so
much that he thought eloquence to rest al together in that thing only. In
likewise Socrates disputyng with Prothagoras / proves by arguments knowledge
in all virtue to bear such room / that vices can no other whence proceed
than of false opinyons. Sin spryngeth of false opynyons.
For certainly brother both he that loves Christ / and he also that loves
voluptuousness / many false honor does follow that thing which is to either
of them swear / good / and beautyfull / but the one slydeth through ignorance
/ instead of a sweet thing enbrasyng a thing out of measure sour / flyeng as
a sour thing that which is swetest of all: also following that thing for good
and for lucre which is naught else but damage and loss / and fearing that
thing for loss / which is chief gaynes or aduau^tage: and iudgyng that
thing to be fair which is foul / and wenyng or trowyng that to be shamfull
which only is glorious and praysefull. In conclusyon if a man were surely and
inwardly brought in believe / and if also it were dygested in to the substance
of his mind as meat in to the substance of the body / that only virtue were
best / most sweet / most fair / most honest / most profitable. And on the
other side fylthynesse only to be an yuell thing / a paynfull tourment or
punysshment / a foul thing / shamfull / full of damage or loss: and did
measure these things not by the opinyon of the comen people / but by the very
nature of the things / it could not be (such perswasyon or believe endurynge)
that he should stycke fast and cleave long time in yuell things. For now
long ago the comen people is found to be the most myscheuous auctoure or
captain both of living and also of judgment: The come^ people is the worst
^^ctor or insti^utor of living
neither was the world ever in so good state and condycion / but that the
worste has pleased the most part. Beware leest thou this wise think / no
man is there that does not this / mine elders before me have walked in these
steps / of this oppynyon is such a man / so great a philosopher / so great a
divine. This is the custom and manner of living of kings / this wise live
great men / this done both bysshoppes and popes / these verily ben no comen
people. Let not these great names move the one ynche. I measure or judge not
the comen or rascal sort by the room / estate / or degree / but by the mind
and stomach. Plato wylleth that we should ymagen a certain nombre of me^ to be
bound with their heedes vpryght so that they coud not ones stir / before
them a wall / a cave at their backs higher than their heedes / without that a
fire and that all things should come to and fro between the fire and the caves
mouth / that the shadows of all things might appear upon the wall before
them / so should they se no this but shadows / so be the ignorant and unlearned
people bound with the bonds of affections that they never se the truth with
eyes of reason.
who so ever in the famous cave of Plato bound with the bonds of their own
affectyons / wonder at the vain images and shadows of things instead of
very true things / they be the comen people. Should he not do preposterously
or out of order if a man would go about to try not the stone by the ruler or
squyre / but the ruler by the stone? And were it not much more unreasonable if
a man would go about to bow and turn / not the manners of men to Christ / but
Christ to the living of men. Think it not therefore well or aright because that
great men or because that the most men do it / but this wise only shall it be
well and right what so ever is done / if it agree to the rule of Christ: ye and
therefore ought a thing to be suspected because it pleases the most part. It
is a small flock and ever shall be to whom is plesaunt the symplycite or
playnesse / the pouertye / the veryte of Christ. It is a small flock verily
but a blyssed / as unto whom doutlesie is due only the kingdom of heaven.
Strayte is the way of virtue and of very jew trodden on / but none other
leads to life. To conclude The flock of good^men is but small.
/ wheder does a wise buylder fetch his ensample of the most comen and used or
of the best work. Paynters set before them none but the best tables or patrons
of ymagerye. Our ensample is Christ / in whom only be all rules of blyssed
living / him may we cou^terfayte without excepcion. But in good and virtuous
men it shall be mete that thou call to ensample every thing / so far forth
as it shall agree with y^ first ensample of Christ. As touching the comen sort
of christen men think thus yt they were never more corrupt / The come^ people
of christen men be most corr^p^e.
no not amongst the gentyles / as appertaynyng to the opynions of their
manners. More over as touching their faith what opinyous they have advise
them. This surely is doutlesse and to be abydden by / faith without manners
worthy of faith preuayleth nothing / in so much also that it grows to a
heap of dampnacyon. The manner of the world (...) a ^^^yes.
Search the hystories of antyquite / to them compare ye manners that be now
adays. when was virtue and true honesty more dispysed? when was so had in
price richesse gotten not regarded whence? In what world at any time was trewer
yt saying of Horacius: Horace the po^te.
verily that lady money gives a wife with dowery / credence / frendshyppe /
nobleness / noble kynne and also beautye. And again this saying of the same
Horace / noblenes and virtue except a man have good withal / is vyler than a
russhe or a straw. who redeth not in good ernest that biting mock of the same
poet: Oh cytezyns cytezyns / first seek money / after seek virtue. when was
riot or excess more immoderat than now? when was adultery and all other
kinds of unchaste living either more appert in the sight of every man / or
more unpunished / or else less had in shame / rebuke or abhomynacion? while
princes favor their own vices / in other men suffrynge them unpunished /
and every man accompteth that most comely and beautyfull to be done what soever
is used and take up among courtyers. To whom seems not pouertye extreme yuell
/ and vttermoste shame and rebuke? The lybert^ of old time.
In time paste against kepers of queens / fylthy ^ygardes / glorious or
gorgyous persons / lovers and regarders of money were cast in the tethe with
rebukful and slaundrous scoffynges and ^estynges / ye with authoryte. And also
in comedyes / tragydes / and other come^ plays of the gentyles a great
clappynge of hands and a showte was made for joy of the ley people / when
vices were craftyly and properly rebuked and checked: at the which same vices
now a days being yuell praised there is made a showte and clappyng of hands
for joy even of y^ nobles and estates of christen men. when the ^mbasadors of
king philyp had of fred to phosyo^ great gifts and had exhorted him to receive
them saying though you may spare the^ well ynonghe yet shall they be
necessari for your chylderne to who^e it shall be hard to opteyne to come to
such honor as you are in / phosyo^ a^swerd if my children shall be like me this
same possession shall fy^d the^ which has brought me to ^e great ho^our if they
should be unlike me / I will not that theyrryot be norysshed and augmented at
my cost.
The athenes in their comen house appointed for disgysinges and enterludes /
could not forbear ne suffer a iester in playeng a certain tragedy of
Euripides / to sing ye words of a certain covetous man which p^ferred money
only before all other co^modytes and pleasure of man's life: and they would
plainly have clapped out of the play / ye and violently cast out of the house
the player with all y^ fable except the poet by and by arysing up had desired
them to tarry a little and behold to what point that so great a wonderer at
money should come. How many ensamples be there in the hystories of gentyles of
them which of the comen welthe well governed and mynistred / brought nothing
in to their poor household but an honest opinyon or reputacion: which set
more by fidelyte than money / by chastyte tha^ by life / whom neither prosperyte
could make proud / wild and wanton / neither aduersite could overcome and
make heavy herted / which regarded honest ieoperdies and dangers before
voluptuousness and pleasures / which contented only with ye conscience of pure
life / desired neither honors neither richesse / nor any other co^modytes of
fortune. And to ouerhyp and make no rehersall of the holiness of Phocion / of
poverty of Fabricius more excellent than riches: Fabricius was a noble man of
Rome whom no man could make to posses richesse or ryceyue gifts or to use
craft or fraud against his enemies in time of mortal war.
of the strong and coragyous mind of Camyllus / of ye strayte and indifferent
justice of Brutus / of the chastyte of Pithagoras / of the te^perau^ce of
Socrates / of the sou^de and constant virtue of Cato: and a thousa^de most
goodly beams of al sorts of virtues which are red every where in thy stories
of ye lacedemones / of y^ perces / of the athenes Camyllus was so constaunt of
mind that no tortune could move him nor no injury coud make him unkind to the
comen welthe.
/ and of the romans to our great shame verily. Holy Aure^ius Augustyne as he
of him self witnesses in ye co^mentaryes of his own co^fessions / long time
before he put christ on him dispysed money / counted honors for naught / was
not moved with glory / praise Brute slew his own sons by cause they conspyred
against the co^en wealth
/ or fame / and to voluptuousness kept the bridell so strayte that he than a
young man was content with one little wenche / to whom he kept also promise and
faith of marriage. Such ensamples among courtyers / among men of the church:
Pyctagoras was the auctor of chaste living
I will also say amongst relygyous persons shall not a man lightly find:
Socrates said that he knew well him self to be unlearned and he never laughed
and yet was he merry,
or else if any such shall be / by and by he shall be poynted / wondered / or
mocked at as it were an ass among apes / he shall be called with one voice of
al me^ a dotyng fool / a gross heed / an ypocrite in nothing expert /
male^coly mad / and shall not be iuged to be a man. So we christen men honor
the doctrine of Christ: The contyne^ce of saint Augustyne.
so cou^trefayte we it that every where now adays nothing is accounted more
folysshe / more vile / more to be ashamed of tha^ to be a christian man in deed
/ with all the mind and heart: as though yt either Christ in vain had been
conuersaunt in earth / or that christe^dom were some other thing now than in
time past / or as it indyfferently pertayned not to al men. I will therefore
that thou from these men vary with all thy mind / and esteem the valor of
every thing by the co^munyon or fellowship of Christ only. To be a very
christen man is accounted every where a very vyse thing
who thinks it not every where to be an excellent thing / and to be nombred
among y^ chief of all good things / if a man discende of a worshypfull stock
and of honorable ancestors / which thing they call nobleness. The va^yte of
noble men.
Let it not move the one whyt when thou herest the wise men of this world /
men of sadness endued with great authorite / so ernestly disputyng of the
degrees of their genelogyes or lynage / having their forheed and upper brows
drawn together with very great grauyte / as it were a matter of a meruaylous
diffyculte / ye and with great enforcement bringyng forth plain tryfles. Nor
let it move the when thou see other so high minded for ye noble acts of
their grantfathers or great grantfathers / that think other in comparyson of
them self scarce to be men: but thou laughyng at the error of these men after
ye manner of Democrytus Democrytus laughed at what soever thing was done in the
life of mortal men: it semyd to hi so folishe a thing
shalt compte (as true it is in deed) that the only and most perfyte
nobleness is to be regenerate in Christ / and to be graffed and planted in the
body of him / to be one body and one spyrit with god. Let other men be kings
sons: to the let it be greatest honor that can be that thou art called / and
art so in deed / ye son of god. The cheifest nobleness is to be the son
of god.
Let them stand in their own conceytes / because they are daily conuersau^t
in great princes courts: chose thou rather to be with David vile abject in ye
house of god. Take heed what manner fellows Christ choseth / feeble persons /
fools / vile as touching this world. In Adam we all are borne of low degree.
In Christ we are all one thing neither high ne low of degree one more tha^
another. Uery nobleness is to dispyse this vain nobleness: very nobleness
is to be servant to Christ. Think the^ to be thine ancestors whose virtues
thou both love and cou^trefaytest. Also hark what the true estymer of
nobleness said in the gospel against the jews which bosted themself to be
of the generation of Abraham: a man verily not excellent only / not rich only
/ not the conqueror of kings only / but also for his divine virtues lauded
of god him self. who would not think this to be a noble thing and worthy
whereof a man might rejoice? Herke yet what they herd: ye are (said Christ) of
your father the dyuell / and the deeds of your father ye do. You ^ay se here
how Paul estemeth noble blodde.
And here also Paul how he estymeth gentle blood / acordynge to his masters
rule: Not al they (says he) which be of cyrcu^cisyon of Israel be israelites
/ neither all they that be of the sede of Abraham be the sons of Abraham. It
is a low degree and shamfull to serve fylthynesse / and to have no kynred with
Christ / which knowlegeth kynred with no man but with such as fulfylleth y^
will of his father in heaven. He is with much shame a bastard which has the
dyuell to his father / and verily who so ever does the deeds of the dyuell
has the dyuell to his father / except Christ lied: but the truth can not
lie. The highest degree that can be is to be the son and heir of god / the
brother and coheyre with Christ: what their badges and cognisaunces mean let
them take heed. The badges of true noblenes.
The badges of Christ be comen to all men / and the most honorable which be
y^ cross / the crown of thorn / the nails / the spear / the signs or
tokens which Paul reioyseth to bear in his body. Of nobleness therefore
thou see how much otherwise I would have the to judge and think than the
ley people ymagyne. who calls not him blyssed / rich / and happy among the
comen people which has heaped together at home a great deal of gold? But
judge thou him to be blyssed enough Rich men be not blessed.
/ ye that he only is blyssed which possesses Christ / very felycyte / and
of all things the best. Judge him happy which has bought y^ noble and
precious margaryte of pure mind with the loss either of al his goods or his
body also / which has found the treasour of wisdom precyouser than all
richesse / which to be made rich has bought of Christ yt is most rich
gold purifyed and proved with fire. what things tha^ be these which the
comen people wondreth at / as gold / p^cious stones / lyuelode: in a wrong
name they be riches what is riches.
/ in ye true name they be very thorns / which choke ye sede of the word of
god / acording to ye parable of the gospel. They be packes or fardels with
which who soever be lade^ neither can follow poor Christ by strayte way
neither enter by ye low door into the kingdom of heaven. Think not thyselfe
better by one here if thou should pass i^ riches either Mydas or Cresus /
but think thy self more bound / more tangled / more lade^. Mydas and Cresus
were two rich kings.
He has habu^dantly enough that can utterly dispyse such things. He is
provided for suffyciently to whom Christ promised nothing should be lackyng. He
shall not be an hungered to whose mouth manna of the word of god seems
plesau^t. He shall not be naked which has put Christ upon him. There is no
d^mage in the loss of riches.
Think this only to be a loss as often as any thing of godliness is mynisshed
/ and any thing of vices is increased. Think it a great lucre or advantage
when thy mind through increase of virtue is waxe^ better. Think thou lackest
nothing as long as thou possessest him in whom is al things. But what is this
which wretches call pleasure? surely it is nothing less than y^ it is called.
what is it than? Pure madness it is / and plainly (as greeks be wont to say)
the laughter of Ayax / sweet poison / plesaunt mischefe. Ayax in his madnee
hanged up two great swyne supposing the one ^o have been Agameno^ the other
vlyxes his two mor^all ^nemyes cha^ with much laughter he raged against the^
casting many iniuryes in their teth / but when he was com to his wits again
he killed him self for shame and sorrow / so because of voluptuous pleasure
follows myschefe / it may be well called the laughter of Aya^.
True and only pleasure is the inward joy of a pure conscience. The most
noble and deyntest dysshe that can be is the study of holy scripture. The most
delectable songs be ye psalms endyted of the holy ghost. The most pleasant
fellowship is ye co^munyon of al saints. The highest deyntes of all is ye
fruycion and enioyeng of the very truth. Pourge now thy eyes / pourge thy
ears / pourge thy mouth / and Christ shall begin to wax sweet and pleasant to
the which tasted ones sauerly: ye if / milesij sibarite / if all incontinent
ryottours and epicuryens / shortly if the vniuersyte of ymagyners and deuysers
of plesures should heap together al their flateryng subtyltes and deynty
disshes / in comparyson of him only they shall seem to provoke ye to spue. That
is not by and by sweet which is sauery / but that which is sauery to a hole
man: if water have the taste of wine to him which burns in a hot fever no /
man will call that a pleasure but a disease. Melosij Siber to were people which
lived dylycately Epycure put felycyte in voluptuousnes.
Thou art disceyued if thou believe not yt the very teeres be much more
pleasant to devout and holy men than be to wicked men laughynges / mockynges /
gestynges or scoffynges: if thou also believe not fasting to be sweter That is
sweet which sauoureth to a hole man.
to ye one tha^ to the other plouers / quayles / fesantes / pertriches pyke /
troute / porpas / or the fresshe struge^. And the moderate bordes of the one
appointed with herbs and fruits to be much more delycate than the costly and
disdaynful feestes of the other. Finally the true pleasure is / for the love of
Christ not to be ones moved with false apparaunt pleasures. Behold now how
much the world abuses the names of love and hate. when a folysshe young man
is clear out of his wit and mad for a wenches sake / that the comen people
calls love / and yet is there no veryer hate in the world. Folysshe love.
True love even with his own loss desires to se unto another man's profit.
whereunto looks he save unto his own pleasure / therefore he loves not her but
himself: yet loves he not him self verily / for no man can love another
except he love him self first / ye and except he love him self aryght. No man
can hate any man atall except he first hate him self. Nevertheless sometime to
love well is to hate well / and to hate well is to love well. who soever
therefore for his little pleasure (as he supposes it) lays a wait and gothe
about to begyle a maiden with flateryng and gifts / with fair promesses / to
pluck from her the best thing she has / that is to wete her perfytnesse /
her chastyte / her symplycite / her innocency / her good mind / and her good
name / whether seems this man to hate or to love? Certaynely there is no hate
more cruel than is this hate / when the folyssh father and mother favor the
vices of their children: Tenderness toward their chylderne.
the comen saying is / how tenderly love they their children. But I pray the
how crewelly hate they their children which (while they follow their own
affectyons) regard not at all the welthe of their children. what other
wyssheth to us our most hateful enemy the dyuell / than that we here
synnynge unpunished should fall in to eternal punysshment. They call him an
easy master and a merciful prince / which at certain grievous offenses
either wynke or favor them / that the more unpunished men sin / the more
boldly and at large they might sin. But what other thing thretneth god by
his prophet to them whom he judges unworthy of his mercy: I will not (says
he) vysyte their daughters when they commit fornycacyon / nor their daughters
inlawe when they committee adultery. Unto Dauyd what promised he. I will (says
he) with a rod look upon their inyquites / and with whyppes their sins /
but I will not take my mercy from them. Thou see how all things are renewed
in Christ / and how the names of things are changed. who soever love him
self otherwise tha^ well / hates himself deedly. who soever be yuell
merciful toward him self is a tyrant most cruel. To care well is not to
regard. To hurt well is to do good. To distroye well is to save. Thou shalt
care well for thy self if thou shalt dispyse the desires of the flesh / if
in good manner thou shall rage against vices / thou shalt do to the man a good
turn. If thou shall kill the sinner thou shalt save the man. If thou shall
distroy that man has made / thou shalt restore that god has made. Come of
now and let us go further: what thinks the error of the people power /
wickedness / manhood / and cowardnesse to be? Call they not him mighty which
can lightly hurt whom him list: though it be a very odyous power to be able to
hurt / for in that are they resembled to noisome worms and scorpyons / and to
to the dyuell him self / yt is to wete in doing harm. Only god is mighty in
deed / which neither can hurt if he would / neither yet would if he could /
for his nature is to do good. But this mighty fellow how does he I beseech
the hurt a man? He shall take away thy money? he shall beat thy body? he shall
rob the of thy life? If he do it to him that serves god well / he has done
a good deed instead of an yuell: but and if he have done it to an yuell man /
the one has mynystred an occasyon verily / but the other has hurt him self:
for no man is hurt but of him self. No man gothe about to hurt another
except the same man has much more grievously hurt him self aforehande. Thou
enforsest to hurt me in my money or goods. Now have thou through the loss
of charity hurt thy self most grievously. Thou canste not fasten a wound in
me / but if thou have received a wound much more grievous. Thou canste not
take from me the life of my body / onelesse thou have slain thine own soul
before. But Paul which to do wrong was a man very weak and feeble / to
suffer wrong most valiant and strong / reioyseth that he could do all
thing in Christ. They call him every where manly and bold which being fyerse
and of impotent mind / for the leest displeasure that can be rages setheth /
or boyleth in wrath / and acquiteth a shrewde word with a shrewde word / a
check with a check / one yuel turn with another. On the other side who so
ever when he has received wrong makes nothing a do / but dissymuleth as no
such thing were done / him thy call a cowarde / a dastarde hertlesse mete for
nothing: ye but what is more contrary to ye greatness of the mind than with
a little word to be put aside from the quiet and consta^cy of the spyrite /
and to be so unable to set at naught another man's folysshnesse / that thou
should think thyselfe to be no man except thou should overcome one shreude
turn with another. But how much more manfull is it with / an excellent and
large mind to be able to dispyse al manner iniuryes / and more over for an
yuell deed to recompense a good? I would not call him a bold man which durst
ieoparde on his enemy / which scale castle or town walls / which (his life
not regarded) put teth him self in all manner ieoperdyes / a thing comen almost
to al warryours / but who so ever could overcome his own mind / who soever
could will the^ good which does him harm / pray for them which curse him.
To this man is due the propre name of a bold and strong man and of excellent
mind. A bold man and a strong in deed.
Let us also dis^cusse another thing / what the world calls praise /
rebuke / and shame. Thou art praised / for what cause and of whom? ^nie praise.
(...) for fylthy things and of fylthy persons / this verily is a false praise
and a true rebuke. Thou art dispraysed / thou art mocked or laughed at / for
what cause and of whom? for godliness and innocence / and that of yuell men:
this is not a rebuke / no there is no trewer praise. Be it y^ all the world
repreue / refuse / and disalowe it / yet can it not be but glorious and of
great praise y^ Christ approves. And though what soever is in the world agree
/ consent / and allow / cryeng with a shoute y^ is a noble deed / yet can it
not be but shamfull that displeases god. They call wisdom wisdom of the
world.
every where to get good stoutly / when it is gotten to maintain it lustely /
and to provide long before for ye time to come: for so we here the^ say
euerywher and in good ernest of the^ which in short time gate substance
somewhat habundantly / he is a thrifty man / ware and wise / cyrcumspect and
prouydent. Thus says the world which is both a liar him self and also his
father. But what says veryte: Fool says he / I will fet again this night
thy soul from the. He had filled his barnes with corn / he (...) siuf^ed his
store houses with prouysyon of all vytayles / and had laid up at home
ha^oundauntly of money enough: he thought nothing was to be done more. Thus
had he done / not because he intended as a nedy keeper to sytte abroad on his
richesse heaped together / as the poets feign the dragon to have kept the
golden flece (which thing men do almost euerywhere) but he enteded to have
spente ioyously / and yet does y^ gospel call this man a fool. For what is
more folissh / what is more gross ymaginacion or more fondness than to gape
at the snadowes and lose the very things / a thing which we be wont to
laughe at in the famous dog of ysope: while we gape at snadowes we lose the
very things / as the dog of ysope which whil he gaped at the shadow lost
his bone in the water.
and in the manners of christen men is it not more to be laughed at / or rather
to be wept at. He may be compted a rude and vnexperte merchaunt that knew not
this saying of Therence: To refuse money at a seasone is sometime a great
advantage / or who so ever would receive a little aduau^tage in hand when he
knew great loss should follow. How much more folysshnesse and vnaduysednesse
is it to make prouysion with so great care for this present life which is but
a shadow / every hour ready to fail: namely wha^ god (if we believe y^ gospel)
will minyster althing necessary for this life / if we have confydence in him /
and for the life to come to make no prouysion atall which we must led away
full of mysery and wretchydnesse / if prouisyon be not made now a forha^de
with great dylige^ce. Here another error / they call him perelesse polityke and
in all things expert / which herknyng for all manner tidings To harken for
tidings out of all contryes is rebuked.
knows what is done throughout all the world / what is the chance of
merchaundyse / what the king of England entendeth / what new thing is done
at Rome / what is chaunsed in France / how the danes and the sytes live /
what matters great princes have in counseyle: to make an end shortly / who ever
can babble with all kinds of men of all manner busynes / him they say to be
wise. But what can be farther from the thought of a wise man / or nere to y^
nature of a fool than to search for those things which be done aferre of and
perteyne to the nothing at al / and not so much as ones verily to think on
those things which are done in thine own breast and perteyne to the only.
Thou tellest me of the trouble and busynes of england / tell me rather what
trouble makes in thy breast / wrath / envy / bodyly lust / ambycyon / how nygh
these be brought in to subjection / what hope is of victory / how much of this
host is put to flight / how reason is decked or appointed. In these things if
thou shall be watchyng and have a quycke ear and also an eye / if thou shalt
smell / if thou shall be circu^specte / I will call the polytyke and peerles:
and that thing which the world is wont to cast against us / I will horle
again at him: he is not wise at al / which is not wise for his own profit.
After this manner if thou shall examyne all the cares of mortal men / their
joys hopes fears studyes / their minds or judgments / thou shall find all
thing full of error while they call good evil / and evil good / while they
make sweet sour and sour sweet: make light darkness / and darkness light. And
this sort of men is the more part by a great deal. Notwithstanding thou must
even at ones both defye them and set no store of them / leest thou sholdest be
minded to be like them: and also pite them so that thou would feign have them
like unto the. And to use the words of saint Augustyn: than is it mete both
to weep for them which are worthy to be laughed at / and to laugh at them
which are worthy to be wept for. Be not in evil things co^firmable to this
world but be reformed in the new wit / that thou may approve not tho
things which men wonder at / but what is the will of god / which is good /
well pleasynge and perfyte. Thou art very nygh ieopardy and no doubt fallest
suddenly from the true way if thou shalt begin to look about the what y^
most part of men do / and to harken what they think or ymagyn: but suffer
thou which art the child of life and of light also that deed men bury their
deed bodies: and let the blind capteyns of blind men go away together in to
the dyche: se thou ones move not the eyes of thy heart any whether from the
first patron and chief ensample of Christ. Thou shalt not go out of the way
/ if thou follow the guydynge of verite. Thou shalt not stumble in darkness /
if thou walk after light / the light shynynge before the: Eurypus is a
certain place in the ^ee where the flood chasigeth seven times in a day and as
often a night so that no ship ca^ sail against the streme.
if thou shalt separate colored good things / from good things in deed: and
evil things in deed from apparaunt evil things thou shall abhor and not
cou^terfeyte the blyndnes of the common people ragynge and chafynge them self
after the manner of the ebbynge and flowyng of the sea at the most vain
illusyons and worldly things / with certain cortesyes of affections of wrath
/ envy / love / hate / hope / fear / joy / sorrow / ragyng more unquietly
than any Euripus. Bragmanyes were people of a certain I Will in Indea with whom
al thi^es were comune and they lived per f^ly despisyng riches possessions and
all worldly things.
The Bragmanyes / Cynikes / Stoikes be wont to defend their pryncyples styfly
with tothe and nail: and even the hole world repugnynge / all men cryenge and
barkynge against them / yet hold they styfly thar thing whereunto they ones
have given sure credence. Be thou bold likewise to fasten surely in thy mind
the decrees of thy sect. Cinikes be the folowers of ^y ^genes the phlosopher
which chorlishly checketh the vices of men.
Be bold without mystrust / and with all that thou can make to follow the
mind of thine author / departing from all contrary opynyons and sects.

Here folowen opynyons mete for a christen man. Capl.xv.
LEt this excellent lernyng and paradoxes of the true christen faith be sure
and steadfast with the / that no christen man may think that he is borne for
him self: neither ought to have the mind to live to himself: but what so
ever he has what so ever he is / that all together let him ascribe not to
him self / but unto god the author thereof / and of whom it came / all his
goods let him think to be commune to all men. A christen man is not borne for
him self either to follow his own pleasure.
The charity of a christen man knows no properte: let him love good men in
Christ / evil men for Christ's sake / which so loved us first when we were
yet his enemies / that he bestowed himself on us all together for our
redempcyon: let him enbrace the one because they be good: the other nevertheless
to make them good: he shall hate no man at all / no more verily than a faithful
phisicyan hates a sick man: let him be an ennemy only unto vices: the
greater the disease is / the greater cure will pure charity put thereto: he is
an adulter / he has committed sacrilege / he is a turk: let a christen man
desye the adulter / not the man: let him despise the co^mytter of sacrilege /
not the man: we must desye ^ abhor the vices / but not the man.
let him kill the turlie / not the man: let him find the means that the evil
man perysshe such as he has made him self to be / but let the man be saved
whom god made: let him will well wysshe well / and do well to all men
unfeignedly: neither hurt them which have deserved it / but do good to them
which have not deserved it: let him be glad of all men's co^modytees as well as
of his own / and also be sorry for all men's harms none otherwise than for his
own. For verily this is that which thapostle commands: to weep with them
that weep / to joy with them that ioyen / yea let him rather take an other
man's harm greuouser tha^ his own: and of his brothers welthe be gladder than
of his own. It is not a christ man's part to think on this wise what have I
to do with this fellow / I know not whether he be black or white he is
unknown to me / he is a stranger to me / he never did ought for me / he has
hurt me sometime / but did me never good Think none of these things: remember
only for what beseruyng can those things which Christ has done / for y^
which would his kyndnes done to the / should be recompensed / not in him self
/ but in thy neighbor. Only se of what things he has need / and what thou
art able to do for him. Think this thing only / he is my brother in our
lord coheyre in Christ / a membre of the same body / redeemed with one blood /
a fellow in y^ common faith / called unto y^ very same grace and felicite of
the life to come / even as the apostle said one body and one spiryt as ye be
called in one hope of your calling one lord and one faith one baptism / one
god / and father of al which is above all and euerywhere / and in all us / how
can he be a stranger to whom thou art coupled with so many fold bonds of
unite? Among the gentyles let those circu^staunces of rethoricyens be of no
little valor and weight / either unto beniuolence or unto maliuole^ce / he is a
citezi^ of y^ same cite / he is of aliau^ce / he is my cousin / he is my
familiar friend / he is my fathers friend / he has well deserved / he is kind
/ borne of an honest stock / rich or otherwise. In Christ all these things
either be nothing / or after the mind of Paul be al one / and the very self
same thing: let this be ever p^sent before thine eyes / and let this suffyse
the / he is my flesh / he is my brother in Christ. what soever is bestowed
upon any member rebou^deth it not to all y^ body / and from thens in to the
heed? we al be members each one of an other / me^bres cleuyng together make a
body. The heed of y^ body is Jesus Christ the heed of Christ is god. It is done
to the it is done to every one / it is done to Christ it is done to god: what
so ever is done to any one membre which so ever it be / whether it be well done
or evil: All these things are one / God / Christ / the body / and the
members / that saying has no place io^uenyently among christen men / like
with like. And the other saying dyuersite is mother of hate: for unto what
purpose perteynen words of discencyon where so great unite is / it sauoureth
not of christen faith that co^munly a courtyer to at own dweller: one of the
country to ar inhabyter of the cite: a man of high degree / to an other of
low degree: an offycer / to him that is offycelesse: the rich to the poor: a
man of honor / to a vile perso^e: the mighty to the weyke: the italyen to the
germayne: the frensshe man to the englysshman: the english to ye scotte: the
gramaryen to the dyuyne: the logycyne^ to the gramaryen: the phisician to the
man of law: the learned to the unlearned: the eloquent to him that is not
facounde and lacks vtteraunce: the syngle to the married: the young to the
old: the clarke to the lay man: the priest to the monk: the Carmelytes to
the Iacobytes: and that (leest I rehearse all dyuersytees) in a very tryfle
unlike to unlike / is somewhat parcial and unkind: where is charity which
loves even his ennemy: wha^ the surname changed / when the color of the
vesture a little altered / wha^ the gyrdle or the shoo and like fantasies of men
make me hated unto the? Charity is not in them which hate another man because
his vesture or garmente is a little altered and changed.
why rather leave we not these childysshe tryfles / and accustom to have
before our eyes that which perteyneth to the very thing: whereof Paul warns
us in many places / that al we in Christ our heed be members of one body /
endued with life by one spirit (if so be we live in him) so that we should
neither envy the ha^pyer me^bres / and should gladly socour and aid the weyke
members: that we might perceive y^ we our self have received a good tu^ne /
when we have done any benefyte to our neighbor: and that we our self be hurt
/ when hurt is done to our brother / and that we might understand how no man
ou^ht to study pryuately for himself / but eu^ry man for his own part should
bestow in common that thing which he has rec^yued of god / that all things
might redou^de and rebou^de thither again / from whens they spronge / that is
to wit / from ye heed. Let every man bestow in comen what soever he received
of god.
This verily is the thing which Paul writes to the Corynthes / saying. As
y^ body is one and has many me^bres / and all the members of the body though
they be many / yet be they but one body. Even so likewise is Christ / for in
one spiryt we be all baptized to make one body / whether we be jews or
gentyles / whether we be bond or free / and all we have drunk of one spirit
(for the body says Paul) is not one membre but many: if the foot shall say /
I am not y^ hand / I am not of the body: is he therefore not of the body? if the
ear shall say / I am not the eye / I am not of ye body: is he therefore not of
the body? if all the body should be the eye / where is than the hearing: if
all the body were y^ hearing / where than should be the smellyng. But now god
has put the members every one of them in the body / as it pleased him: for if
all were but one member / where were y^ body: but now verily ben there many
members / yet but one body. The eye can not say to the hand I have no need of
thy help / or again the heed to the fete / ye be not to me necessary: but
those me^bres of the body which seem to be y^ weyker are much more necessary:
and to those which we think to be the viler members of the body we give more
haboundaunt honor: and those which be our dishonest me^bres have more
habou^daunt honesty / for our honest me^bres have need of nothing. But god has
tempered and ordered the body / gyuyng plenteous honor to that part which
lacked / because there should be no division / debate or strife in the body /
but that the me^bres should care one for an other indifferently. But it is ye
which are the body of Christ and members one dependynge of an other. He
writes like things to the Romans / saying in one body we have many members /
and all me^bres have not one office. Even so we being many are but one body in
Christ: Every membre has his ^^^^pacyon necessary to the profit of the soul
but syn gularly we be me^bres each one of another having gifts diverse after
the grace which is given to us. And again to ye Ephe^. workyng verite (says
he) in charity / let us in all manner things grow in him which is the heed /
y^ is to wit Christ in whom all the body co^pacte and knyt by every joint
whereby one part mynystreth to another according to the operacion and virtue
which spryngeth of the heed and capacite of every membre / in receyuynge
makes the increase of the body for the edifyeng of him self in charity. And in
another place he bids every man to bear one another burden / because we be
me^bres one of another. Look than whether they perteyn unto this body whom
thou hear spekyng every where after this manner / it is my good / it came to
me by inheritance / I possess it by right and not by fraud / why shall not I
use it and abuse it after mine own mind / why should I give them of it any
deal at all to whom I owe nothing / I spyll / I waste / I destroy / that
which peryssheth is mine own / it makes no matter to other men. Thy membre
complayneth and grenneth for hunger / and thou spewest up partryges. Thy naked
brogher shyuereth for cold / and with the so great plenty of ray me^t is
corrupt with mothes and long lyeng One nyghtes dicing has lost the a
thousand pieces of gold / while in the mean season some wretched wenche (need
compellynge her) has set forth her chastity to sell / and is beco^me a common
harlot / and thus peryssheth ye soul for whom Christ has bestowed his life.
Thou say again: what is that to me / I entreat y^ which is mine own after
mine own fascion: and after all this with this so corrupt mind thynkest thou
thy self to be a chryste^ man / which art not ones a man verily? Thou hear
in the presence of a great multitude the good name or fame of this or y^ man
to be hurt / thou hold thy peace / or peradventure reioysest and art well
content with y^ backbyter. Thou say I would have reproved hi^ if those
things which were spoken had perteyned to me / but I have nothing ado with
him which was there sclaundered. Than to conclude / thou have nothing ado
with the body / if thou have nothing ado with the membre / neither have thou
ought ado with the heed / verily if y^ body nothing aperteyne to the. A man
(say they now a days) with violence may defend and put abacke violence? what
the Emperors laws perniyt I pass not thereon. This I marvel how these
boyces came in to the manners of christen men / I hurt him / but I was provoked
/ I had lever hurt than be hurt. Be it man's laws punisshe not that which they
have permytted. But what will the Emperor Christ do / if thou begyle his law
which is written in Mathewe. I command you (says Christ there) not ones to
withsta^de harm: Desire not vengeasice.
but if a man shall give the a blow on the right cheke / offer to him also ye
other. And who so ever will strive with the in the law / and take from the thy
cote / yield up to him also thy cloak or ma^tell. And who so ever shall compel
the to go with hi^ one mile / go with hi^ two mo other. Love your enemies / and
do good to them which hate you / and pray for them which persecute you and
pyke matters against you / that ye may be ye sons of your father which is in
heaven / which makes ye son to rise upon good and evil / and sends rain
upon just and iniust. Thou answerest / he spoke not this to me / he spoke it to
his apostles / he spoke it to perfyte persons. Herdest thou not how he said
that ye may be the sons of your father: if thou care not to be the sone of god
/ that law pertains not to the. This is spoken to all christen men.
Nevertheless he is not good verily which would not be perfyte. Hark also an
other thing: if thou desire no reward / the commandment belongs not to
the: for it follows. If ye love them which love you / what reward shall ye
have: as who should say none: for verily / to do these things (yt is to say /
to love them that loves the) is not virtue: but not to do it / is an evil
thing: there is debt of neither side where is just recompense made of both
sides. Here Paul both a great wise man and conuynge and an interpretour also
of Christ's law. Bless (says he) them yt persecute you / bless them / and
curse them in no wise / rendrynge to no man evil for evil / if it may be
almoche as in you is / having rest and peace with all men / not defendyng your
self my best beloved brethren / but give place and withstand ye not wrath:
for it is written. Uengeau^ce shall be reserved to me and I will quyte them says
our lord. But if thine ennemy shall be hungry / give to him meat: if he be
athurst / give to him drink: for if thou do this / thou shall hepe coals of
fire upon his heed / that is to say / thou shall make him to love ferue^tly. Be
not ouerco^me of evil / but over come evil in goodness. what shall than follow
say thou / if I shall with my softnes nourysshe up the knappyshnes or malice

a new? If thou can without thine own evil either avoid or put by evil / no
man forbyddeth the to do it: but if not / look thou say not it is better to do
tha^ to suffer. To a christen man / it is bet to suffer than to do.
Amend thine enne my if thou can / either ladynge him with benefits / or
ouerco^myng him with mekenes: if that help not / it is better that the one
perysshe tha^ both: it is better yt thou wax rich with the lucre and
aduau^tage of pacyence than that while either to other renders evil / both
be made evil. Let this therefore be a decree among christen men The decree of
christen men.
/ to compare with all men in love / in mekenes and in benefytes / or doing
good: but in siryuyng hate or backbytyng / in rebukes and injury / to give
place eue^ to them that be of lowest degree / and that with good will. But he is
unworthy to whom a good turn should be done / or an evil forgyuen / yet is it
mete for the to do it / and Christ is worthy for whose sake it is done I will
neither (say they) hurt any man neither suffer my self to be hurt: yet when
thou art hurt / se thou forgive the trespace with all thy heart / prouydynge
always that nothing be which any man should remytte or forgive unto the. Be
as ware and diligent in avoiding that none offense or trespace proceed from
the / as thou art easy and ready to remytte an other man's. Offenses must be
forgyuen.
The greater man thou art / so much the more submytte thy self / that thou in
charity aplly thy self to al men. If thou come of a noble stock / manners
worthy of Christ shall not dishonor / but honor ye noblenes of thy birth. A
gentylman.
If thou be co^nyng and well learned / so much the more soberly suffer and
amend the ignorance of ye unlearned. A co^nyng man.
The more is committed and lent to ye / the more art thou bound to thy
brother. A rich man.
Thou art rich / remember thou art the dispe^ser / not the lord: take heed
circu^spectly how thou entreatest the common good. Byleuest thou that proprete
or i^propriacyon was prohybyte and voluntary pouerte emoyned to monks only?
Pouerte is not emoyned to monstes only.
Thou art deceived / both perteyne indifferently to all christen men. The law
punissheth y^ if thou take away any thing of an other man's: it punissheth not
if thou withdraw thine own from thy nedy brother: but Christ will punysh both.
if thou be an offycer / let not the honor make the more fyerse / but let the
charge make the more diligent and fuller of care. I bear not (say thou) no
office of the church / I am not a shepherd or a bishop. Let us grant you
that / but also art thou not a christen man / consider thou of whens thou art /
if thou be not of y^ church. So greatly Christ is common in to contempt to the
world / that they think it a goodly and excellent thing to have nothing to
do with him: and that so much the more every man should be despised the more
coupled he were to him. Hear thou not daily of the lay persons in their
fury the names of a clarke / of a priest / of a monk / to be cast in our
tethes / instead of a sharp and cruel rebuke saying thou clarke / thou
priest / thou monk / that thou art: and y^ is done / utterly with none other
mind / with none other voice or pronouncynge / than if they should cast in our
tethes incest or sacrilege. Incest is to me dell with their own kynne
I verily mernayle why they also cast not in our tethes baptym / why also
object they not against us with the sarazyns the name of Christ as an
obprobrious thing. Sacrylege is to violate persons sacred to god / or to rob
churches.
If they said an evil clarke / an unworthy priest / or an vnreligyous monk /
in y^ they might be suffered as men which note the manners of the persons / and
not despise the professyon of virtue. But who so ever counts praise in them
self the deflouryng of virgyns / good taken away in war / money either won or
lost at dyce or other chance / and have nothing to lay against another man
more spytefull or obprobrious or more to be ashamed of / than the names of a
monk or a priest. Certainly it is easy to conjecture what these / in name
only christen men judge of Christ. There is not one lord of the bishops and
another of the temporal officers / but both be under one / and to the same
both must give accomptes: If thou took any otherwhere save unto him only /
either when thou receyuest thoffye^ or when thou mynistrest it / it makes no
matter though the world call the not a symonyake / he surely will punysshe the
as a symonyake. A symonyake.
If thou labor and make means to obtain a comen office / not to profit in
comen / but to provide for thine own welthe privately / and to aduenge thy
self of them to whom thou owe a grudge / thy office is bribery or robery
before god. Thou hu^test after thieves not that he should receive his own that
is robbed / but leest it should not be with the which is with y^ thieves. How
much difference I pray the is there between the thieves and the / except
peradventure yt they be the robbers of merchau^tes / and thou the robber of
robbours. A pretty note for shrenes ^ other offyce^^.
In conclusyon except thou bear thine office with this mind / that thou be
ready / and that with the loss I will not say of thy goods / but of thy life
to defend that which is right / Christ will not approve thy adminystracyon.
I will add also another thing of ye mind or judgment of Plato: No man is
worthy of an office which is gladly in an office. If thou be a prince / beware
leest these perylous wytches the voices of flaterers do enchaunt or bewytche
the. He is worthy to be an officer which is in office against his will.
Thou art a lord / over the laws thou art fre / what soever thou do is
honest / to the is laufull what soever thou list. Those things pertayne not to
the which are preached daily of priests to the comen people: ye but think
thou rather which is true / that there is one master over all men / and he
is Christ Jesus / to whom thou ought to be as like as is possible / to
whom thou ought to confyrme thyselfe in all things / as unto him certaynely
whose authorite or room thou bear. Christ is lord both of lay men and
also of priests.
No man ought to follow his doctrine more straytely than thou / of whom he will
ask accomptes more straytly than of other. Think not streyghtwaye that to be
right that thou will / but only will thou which is right. what so ever may
be fylthy to any man in the world / se that thou think not that an honest
thing to the / but se thou in no wise permytte to thy self any thing which
is used to be forgyuen and pardoned among the comen sort. Desyre^ but that
whichis right.
That which in other men is but a small trespace / think in thy self to be a
great outrage or excess. Let not thy richesse greater than the comen peoples
bring unto the honor / reverence / and dignyte / favor / and authorite:
but let thy manners better than the comen peoples utterly deserve them. Suffer
not the commen people to wonder at those things in the / wherewith are provoked
and entised the very same mischeuous deeds which thou punysshest daily. The
honesty^ of good manners.
Take away this wondryng and praise of richesse / and where be thieves / where
be oppressors of the comen welthe / where be co^mytters of sacrylege / where
be erra^t thieves and robbers or reuers: take away wo^dring at voluptuousnes /
and where be rauysshers of women / where be adulters. As often as thou wylt
apere so^what acordyng after thy degree among thy friends and subjects or them
over whom thou bear office / room or authorite / set not open thy riches
and tresure to ye eyes of folysshe persons. when thou will seem somewhat welthy
/ show not in bost the ryottous example of expense and boluptuousnesse. First
of al let them learn in the to dispyse such things / let them learn to
honor virtue to have measure in price / to rejoice in temperau^ce / to give
honor to sobre lowlynesse or meekness. Let none of those things be seen in
thy manners and conuersacyon / which thine authorite punyssheth in the manners
and conuersacyon of the people. Thou shalt banysshe yuell deeds in the best
wise / if men shall not se tychesse and voluptuousness / the matter and ground
of yuell deeds to be magnyfyed in the. Thou shalt not dispyse in co^paryson of
thy self any man / no not the vylest of the lowest degree / for comen and
indyfferent is the price wherewith ye both were redeemed. Let not the noise of
ambycion / neither fiersnesse / neither wepons / nor men of the guard defend
the from contempt but pureness of living grauyte / manners incorrupt and
sound from al manner vices of the comen people. Nothing forbyddeth (in bearyng
rule) to keep ye chief room / and yet in charity to discern no room. The
rule of christen princes.
Think beari^g of room or rule to be this / not to excel and go before other
men in habundau^ce of richesse / but to profit al men as much as is possible.
Turn not to thine own profit things which are comen / but bestow those
things which be thine own / and thine own self all together upon the comen
welthe. The comen people owes very many things to the / but thou owe all
things to them. Though thine ears be compelled to suffer names of ambycion /
as most mighty / most christened / holiness / and majesty / yet let thy
mind not be a known of the^ / but refer al these things unto Christ to
whom only they agree. Let the crime of treson against thine own person (which
other with great words make an heinous offense) be counted of y^ a very
tryfle. The majesty of a Prince.
He vyolateth the majesty of a prince in deed / which in the princes name
does any thing cruelly / vyole^tly / mischeuously contrary to right. Let no
man's injury move the less than y^ which pertayneth to the privately:
remember thou art a publyke person / and that thou ought not to think but
of comen matters. If thou have any courage with the and redynesse of wit /
consydre with thy self not how great a man thou art / but how great a
charge thou bear on thy back: and the more in ieoperdy thou art so much
the less favor thyselfe / fetchyng ensample of mynistryng thine office not of
thy predecessors or else of flaterers / but of Christ: The ma^er and form of
berynge rule must be set of christ.
for what is more unreasonable than that a christen prince should set before
him for an ensample Hanyball / great Alexandre / Caesar / or Pompey / in ye
which same persons when he can not attain some certain virtues / he shall
counterfayte those things most chefely which only were to be refused and
avoided. Let it not forth withal be taken for an ensample if Caesar have done
any thing lauded in histories / but if he have done any thing which varyeth
not from the doctrine of our lord Jesus Christ / or be such that though it be
not worthy to be cou^trefayted yet may it be applied to the study or exercise
of virtue. Let not an hole empire be of so great valor to the that thou
wollest wetyngly ones bow from the right: put of that rather than thou
should put of Christ. Doubt not Christ has to make the amends for thempyre
refused / far better than the empire. what is comely for princes.
Nothing is so comely / so excellent / so glorious unto kings as to draw as
nygh as is possible unto the simylitude of the highest king Jesus / which as he
was the greatest so was he also the best. Christ is the gretest / he is also
the best.
But that he was the greatest that dissymuled he and hid secret here in
earth: that he was the best / that had he lever we should perceive and feel /
because he had leauer we should countrefayte that. He denied his kingdom to be
of this world / when he was lord of heaven and earth also. But the princes of
the gentyles use domynion upon them. A christen man exercyseth no power over
his but charity / and he which is the chefest thinks himself to be mynyster
unto all men / not master or lord. wherefore I marvel y^ more a great deal
how these ambycyous names The clergy is touched of ambycyo^ and vain tytelles
of names.
of power and domynyon were brought in / even unto the very popes and bishops
/ and that our diuynes be not ashamed no less indiscreetly than ambyciously to
be called euerywhere our masters / wha^ Christ forbade his discyples that they
should not suffer to be called either lords or masters: for we must remember
that one is in heaven both lord and master Christ Jesus / which is also heed
unto us al. Apostle / a sheparde a bishop / be names of office or service /
The names of office.
not of domynion and rule: A pope / an abbot be names of love / not of power.
But why enter I in to ye great see of the common errors? unto what soever
kind of men he shall turn himself / a very spu^all man shall se many things
which he may laugh at / and mo which he ought to weep at / he shall se very
many opynyons to far corrupt and varyeng from the doctrine of Christ both
far and wide: of the which a great part springs there hence / that we
have brought even into christendom a certain world / and that which is read
of the world among the old diuynes / men of small lernyng now adays
refer to the^ which be not monks. The world in the gospel with the
apostels / with saint Augustyne / Ambrose / and Hierome be called infydels
strangers from the faith / the enemies of the cross of Christ. Blasfemers
of god / they that are such care for to morrow and for the time to come / for
who soever mistrusteth Christ neither believe on him: they be they which fight
and strive for richesse / for rule / for worldly pleasure as men which blinded
with delyces of sencyble things / set their minds and hole affectyons upon
appare^t good things / instead of very good things. This world has not
known Christ the very and true light. This world is altogyther set on
myschefe / loves him self / lives to him self / studyeth for him self and
for his own pleasure / and all for lack he has not put upon him Christ
which is very and true charity. From this world separated Christ not his
apostels only / but all men who soever and as many as he judged worthy of him.
After what manner than and fassyon I pray you do we myngle with christe^dom
this world every where in holy scripture condemned? and with the vain name
of the world favor / flatter / and maintain our own vices. Many doctors
and teachers augment this pestylence / which corruptyng the word of god (as
Paul says) wresten and fassyonen his holy scripture according to ye manners
of every time / when it were more co^uenyent that the manners should be adressed
and amended by the rule of his scripture. And no myscheuouser kind of
flattering verily is there / than when with the words of the gospel and of
the prophtes we flatter y^ diseases of the mind and cure the^ not. A prince
hereth al power is of god: All power is of god.
forthwith (as ye proverb says) his comb ryseth. why has the scripture made
the high or swellyng in mind rather than circumspecte and careful. Thynkest
thou that god has committed to the an empire to be governed / and thynkest
thou not that the same will require of the a strayte rekenyng of the ordringe
thereof? The covetous man hereth it to be forbid unto christen men to have two

we have also learned if holy men have done any thing not to be counterfayted or
followed / ye only to take of them and draw in to the ensample of living.
Adulterers and murdrers flateren and clawen them selves with the example of
Dauyd. Such as gapeth after worldly riches lay against us for their excuse
rich Abraham. Princes which count it but a sport or pastyme every where to
corrupt and defyle virgyns / nombre and reken up to cloak their vice the
queens co^cubynes of Solomon. They whose belly is their god / ^ayeth for their
excuse the drunkenness of Noe. Incestes which pollute their own kynswomen /
cloak and cover their fylthynes with the^sample of Loath / which lay with his
own daughters. why turn we our eyes from Christ to these men? I dare be
bold to say that it ought not to be countrefayted and followed / no not so
much as in ye prophets or Christ's apostels verily / if any thing swerve or
wrie from the docttryne of Christ. Nothing ought to be counterfeyted which
varye from christ.
But if it delight men so greatly to countrefayte holy sinners / I do not
against say them / so that they countrefayte them hole and altogyther. Thou
have followed Dauyd in adulterye / much more follow him in repentance. Thou
have cou^trefayted Mary Magdalayne a sinner / cou^tefrayt her also loving much
/ countrefayte her weeping / cou^trefayte her casting her self down at y^ the
fete of Jesus. Thou have persecuted ye church of god as Paul did / thou have
forsworn thy self as Peter did: Se likewise that thou stretche forth thy
neck for ye faith and relygyon of Christ after the ensample of Paul / and
that thou fear not the cross no more than Peter. For this cause god suffers
even great and right excellent men also to fall in to certain vices / that we
when we have fallen should not despair / but with this condycion / (...) that
we as we have been their fellows in synnyng and doing amysse / even so will be
their companyons and parteners in the amendynge of our sins and misdeeds.
Now do we greatly praise and magnify that same thing which was not to be
countrefayted and followed / and certain things we turn good things to evil
which were well done of them / we do deprave and corrupt / after the manner of
spyders suckynge out the poison only / if any be therein / or else tournynge
even the wholesome joyce also in to poison to our selves. what does Abrahames A

which came to him habunda^tly by their own acorde / even this thing may be an
euyde^t token and proof that with out delay at ye voice of god co^maundyng him
/ he brought forth his only son to be slain. How much think thou
disspysed he his droues of oxen which dispysed even his own son? And
thynkest thou which dreamest nothing else but of fylthy lucre and aduau^tage /
which praysest and set by nothing but only money / which art ready as soon as there chance any hope of lucre / be it never so little / either to

is to wete / leest none issue of mankind should have remained after them / and
that when this precept of god (grow and multyply) was as yet in full vygoure
and strength. And dare thou compare thy filthy and prodigyous voluptuousness
and lechery with the deed of these wenches? Nay I would not doubt to count thy
matrymony not so good as their inceste committed with their father / if in
matrymonye thou do not study for issue / but to satysfye thine own
voluptuous apetyte or lust. The wedlock of some men is worse then the incest
of lothes daughters.

for fear of death denied his master Christ / for whose sake afterward he dyed
with good will: Shall it be laufull thynkest thou than to the for that cause /
to forswear thy self for every tryfle? Paul sinned not purposely and for the
nones / but fell through ignorance: when he was warned and taught / he
repented forthwith and came into the right way. Thou both ware and wise / and
seeing what thou do / wetyngly and wyllyngly co^tynuest from youth to age
in vices and sins / and yet by the ensample of Paul strokest thou thine own
heed. Mathewe being commanded but with one word / without any taryeng / at
ones utterly forsook all his office of receyuynge custom or tollage: but thou
art so sworn and married to thy money that neither so many ensamples of holy
men / neither the gospels of often herd / nor so many preachynges can deuorce
or pluck the from it. Saint Auste^ is excused he had but one at ones.
The bysshoppes say unto me / saint Augustyne (as it is red) had two
soueraygne ladies or concubynes: ye but he than was an hethen man / and we be
nourisshed up in christendom: he was young / and our heedes be hoar for age. A
worshypfull comparyson / because that he being young / and also an hethen man
to avoid the snares of matrymony / had a little wenche instead of a wife / and
yet to her which was not his wife kept he the promise of wedlock. Shall it be
therefore ye less shame for us christian men being old / being priests / ye
being bishops to be altogyther spotted and fyled in every podell one after
another of bodily lusts. Farwele good manners when we have given to vices y^
names of virtues / and have begone to be more wily and subtyle in defe^dyng our
vices than dilyge^t to amend them / most specially when we have learned to
nourysshe / to underset / and to strength our froward opinyons / with the
help and aid of holy scripture. Thou therefore my most sweet brother (the
come^ people altogyder set at naught with their both opynyons and deeds)
purely and holly hasten the unto the chisten seccte. what soever in this life
apereth to thy sensyble powers either to be hated or loved / al yt for the love
of pytie and virtuous life indyfferently dispysed / let Christ only to the be
suffycient / the only auctour both of true iudgyng and also of blissed
living. And this verily the world thinks to be pure folysshnesse and
madness: never the less by this folysshnesse it pleases god to save them
which on him believe. And he is happily a fool that is wise i^ Christ: and he
is woefully wise that is folisshe in Christ. But herest thou / as I would have
y^ to vary strongly from the comen people / so I would not y^ thou showing a
point of curryshnes / should every where bark against y^ opinyons and deeds
of other men / and with authorite co^dempne the^ / pratle odiously against all
men / furyously preche against y^ living of every person leest thou purchase to
thy self two yuels together. A man may not bark every where against the deeds
of other men.
The one yt thou should fall into hate of all men: the other that when thou art
hated thou should do good to no man. But be thou all things to all men / to win all men to Christ as much as may be (pite not offended) so shape and
fascion thy self to al men outwardly / that within thy purpose remain sure /
steadfast and unmoved / withoutforth let gentylnes / curteys language / softnes
/ profytablenes allure and entyce thy brother / whom it is mete with fair
means to be i^duced to Christ / and not to be feared with cruelnes. In
conclusion that which is in thy breast is not so greatly to be rored forth with
cruel words / as to be declared and vttred with honest manners. And again
thou ought not so to favor the infyrmite of the co^mun people that thou
durst not at a time strongly defend the verite: with humanite men must be
amended / and not deceived.

The seventh rule. Caplo.xvj.
MOre over if through infancye and feebleness of mind we can not as yet attain
to these spiritual things / we ought nevertheless to study not the
sluggyssher one deal / yt at the leest we draw as nygh as is possible. we
must still be clymmynge ye though we dispeyre to atteyn to the top.
How be it the very and compendyous way to felicite is / if at ones we shall
turn our hole mind to the contemplacyon and beholding of celestial things so
fervently / that as the body brings with him his shadow / eue^ so the love of
Christ the love of eternal things and honest bri^geth with him naturally the
lothsomnes of caduke and transytory things and the hate of fylthy things. For
either other necessaryly follows the other: and the one with y^ other either
augme^teth or mynyssheth. As much as thou shall profit in y^ love of Christ
so much shall thou hate the world. The more thou shall love and set by
things inuisyble / the more vile shall wax things vain and momentany. we
must therefore do even that same in the discyplyne of virtue which Fabius
counseyleth to be done in scyences or facultees of learning / that we at ones
prece up to the best / which thing yet if through our own fault will not
come to pass. The next of all is that we at the leest may by certain
natural prudence abstain from great vices / and keep our^selfe (as much as
may be) hole and sou^de to the benefycence of god. For as that body is nere
unto health / which (though it be wasted) is free yet and out of the danger
of noisome humors / even so is that mind more capax Capax apt to receive.
of the benefyte of god / which is not yet inquynate or defiled with grievous
offenses / though she lack yet true and perfyte virtue. If we be to weyke to
follow the apostles / to follow the martyrs / to follow the virgynes / at the
leest way let us not comyt^e that the Ethnykes or hethen men should seem to
ouerronne us in this plain or lystes. If thou ca^ not counterfeit holy saints
/ be not yet inferior to hethen men.
Of the which very many when they neither knew god whom they should dread /
neither by leued any hell whom they should fear: yet determined they that a
man ought by all crafts to avoid and eschew fylthynesse for the thing it
self. In so much that many of them chose rather to suffer the loss of fame /
loss of goods / in conclusyon to suffer loss of life / than to depart from
honest. If sin it self be such a manner thing / that for no co^modytees or
inco^modytees proffered to man it ought to be committed. Certainly if neither
the justice of god fear us / neither his benefycence dyscourage us and move us
to the contrary / if no hope of immortalite or fear of eternal pain call us
abacke / or else if the very natural fylthynesse of sin withdraw us not /
which could withdraw the minds of the very gentyles. At the leest way let a
thousand inco^modytees which accompanye the sinner in this life put a
christen man in fear: Ponder in thy mind the inco^modytees of sin.
as infamye / loss or waste of goods / pouertye / the contempt and hate of
good men / grefe of mind / unquietness and furment of conscience most miserable
of al / which though many feel not now presently / either because they be
blinded with dullness of youth / or made dronke with the voluptuousnes and
pleasure of sin / yet shall they feale it here after: and plainly the later
it happens / so much the more unhappily shall they feale it: wherefore young
men most specially should be warned and exhorted that they would rather believe
so many authors that the very nature and properte of sin were thus in deed
than with miserable and woeful experyence learn it in them self / and that
they would not co^taminate nor defyle their life before they knew surely what
life meant. if Christ be to the vile / to whom thou art so costly / at the
leestway for thine own sake refrain thy self from fylthy things. And though
it be very perylous to tarry anywhile in this state / as bitwene three ways (as
it is i^ the proverb) nevertheless unto them which can not as yet clym up to
the pure / perfyte and excellent virtue / it shall not be a little profitable to
be in the ciuyle or moral virtues rather than to ^on hedlong in to all kind
of vices and uncleanliness. hear that is ^n cyuyl or moral virtues.
Here is not the restyng place and quiet haven of felicite / but from hens is a
shorter journey and an easyer stayre up to felicite. In the mean season for
all that / we must pray god that he will vouchsafe to pluck us up to
bettthynges.

The eight rule. Caplo.xvij.
IF the storm of temptacion shall rise against the somewhat thycke and grievously
/ begin not forthwithal to be disco^tent with thy self / as though for y^
cause god either cared not for the / or favored the not / or y^ thou sholdest
be but an easy christen man / or else the less perfyte: but rather give
thanks to god because he instructs the as one which shall be his heir in
time to come / because he beteth or scourges y^ as his most singular beloved
sone and proves the as his assured friend. It is a very great token a man to
be reject from the mercy of god wha^ he is vexed with no temptacyons. Let come
to thy mind the apostle Paul which obtained to be admitted or let in even in
to the mysteries of the third heaven / yet was he beaten of the angel of
satan. Let come to remembrance the friend of god Job: Temptacyon is a sign
that god loves us.
remember Ierom / Benedict / Frauncys / and with these innume rabble other holy
fathers vexed and troubled of very great vices: if that which thou suffrest be
common to so great men / be common to so many men as well as to the / what
cause is there wherefore thou sholdest be smyt^e out of countenance / sholdest
be abashed or fall in to despair? enforce rather and strive that thou may
ouerco^me as they did / god shall not forsake the / but with temptacion shall
make increase / that thou may be able to endure.

The nynth rule. Caplo.xviij.
AS expert capteyns are wo^t to cause when all things are quiet at rest and at
peace / that the watch we must ever keep watch.
nevertheless be dewly kept: likewise se thou that thou have always thy mind
watchyng and circu^specte against the sodeyn assaute of thine enemy (for he
ever co^passeth round about Let temptacio^ be holde^ down at the beginning
while it is fresh.
seeking whom he might devour) that thou may be the more ready as soon as
he assauteth the to put him back manfully / to confou^de him and forthwith to
trede underfoot the heed of y^ pestyferous and poison serpent: for he is never
ouerco^me either more easily or more surely and perfytly / tha^ by that means.
The children or babylon sygnyf eth subgestyon or te^ptacyo^ or the first
inocio^s to syn.
Therefore it is a very wise point to dasshe the young children of babylon (as
soon as they be borne) against the stone which is Christ / or they grow
strong and great.

The tenth rule. Caplo.xix.
BUt the te^pter Remedies against te^ptacio^
is put back most of al by this means / if thou shall either vehemently hate
/ abhor and defye / and in a manner spyt at him streyghtway wha^ so ever he
entyceth and moves the with any te^ptacyon / or else if thou pray fervently or
get thy self to some holy occupacion / setting thine hole mind there unto: or
if thou make answer to the tempter with words fette out of holy scripture /
as I have warned the before. In which thing verily it shall not profit
meanly against al kind of temptacyon to have some certain sentences prepared
and ready / specially those with which thou have felt thy mind to be moved
and stered vehemently.

The.xj. rule. Caplo.xx.
Two dangers chefely follow good men / one leest in temptacyon they give up
their hold. The night fear: is fearelest we should be overcome.
An other leest after the victory in their consolacyon and spyrytuall joy they
wax wanton and stand in their own conceyte / or else please themself. The
devil of myddaye is pride.
Therefore that thou may be sure not only from the night fear / but also
from the devil of myddaye: Remember thou art able to do all things in
Christ.
look when thine ennemy stereth the unto fylthy things that thou behold not
thine own feebleness or weyknes / but remember only that thou can do all
things in Christ / which said not to his apostles only / but to the also and
to al his me^bres / even unto the very lowest. Have confidence for I have
ouerco^me ye world. Again when so ever either after thine ennemy is over come
/ or in doing some holy work / thou shall feel thy mind inwardly to be
comforted with certain preuy delectacyo^s. Than beware diligently y^ thou
ascrybe nothing thereof unto thine own merits / but thank only the free
beneficence of god for all to gyder / and hold down and refraynethy self
with the words of Paul / saying. what have thou / that thou have not
received? if thou have received it / why reioyiest thou as though thou had
not received it? And so against this double myschefe shall there be a double
remedy / if thou in the conflict mystrustyng thine own strength do flee for
socour unto thy heed Christ / putting the hole trust of conquerynge in the
benyuolence of him only. And if also in the spirytuall conforte and
consolacyon thou immedyatly give thanks to him for his benefyte / humbly
knowing and confessing thine unworthiness.

The.xij. rule. Caplo.xxj.
When thou fyghtest with thine enemies / think it not enough for the to
avoid his stroke / or put it back / except thou also take ye wepon from him
manfully / and lay therewith again at the owner / killing him with his own
sword. That shall come to pass on this wise. if wha^ thou art provoked unto
evil thou do not only abstain from sin / but thereof do take unto the an
occasyon of virtue: Of temptacion take ever an occasion of virtue.
and as poets elegantly feign y^ Hercules did grow and was also hardened in
courage through the dangers that Juno put unto him of displeasure. Thou like
wise give also attendau^ce that by the instigacions of thine enemy not only
thou be not y^ worse but rather be made much better. Thou art stered unto
bodyly lust / know thy weyknes / and also lay apart somewhat the more of
lawful plesures / and add some increase unto chaste and holy occupacio^s.
Thou art prycked unto covetousness and nyggysshe keeping: encreace alms deeds
Thou art moved unto vain glory: so much the more humble thy self in all
things And thus shall it be brought about that every temptacyon may be a
certain renewing of thy holy purpose / and an encreace of pite and virtuous
living. Let te^ptacyo^s be ever the renewyng of thy holy purpose.
And verily other means is there none at al of so great virtue and strength to
vaynquish and overthrow our ennemy: for he shall be afraid to provoke the a
fresshe / leest he which reidyseth to be the begynner and chief capyteyne of
wyckednes should mynyster an occasyon of pite / virtue and godlynes.

The.xiij. rule. Caplo.xxij.
BUt always take heed that thou fight with this mind and hope / as though that
should be the last fight that ever thou shall have / if thou get the over
hande^for it may be verily that the benignite of god will give and grant this
reward unto thy virtue and noble act: that thine ennemy ones ouerco^me to his
shame / shall never afterward come upon the again. A thing which we read to
have happened to diverse holy men: neither bileueth Origene against reason /
that when christen men ouerco^me / than is y^ power of their enemies minisshed
/ whiles ye adversary ones put back manfully / is never suffered to return
again to make a fresshe battle. Be bold therefore in the conflycte to hope for
perpetual peace. After one battle we must look for another.
But again after thou have ouerco^me / so behave thy self as though thou
sholdest go again to fight straight way / for after one temptacyon / we must
look ever for an other: we may never depart from our harneys and wepons: we
may never forsake our sta^dyng: we may never leave of watch as long as we
war in the garryson of this body. Every man must have always that saying of
the prophet in his heart / I will keep my standing.

The.xiiij. rule. Caplo.xxiij.
WE must take very good head that we despise not any vice as light for no enemy
overcomes oftener tha^ he which is not set of: in which thing I perceive not
a few men to be greatly deceived: for they deceive the^self while they favor
the^self in one or two vices / Some me^ fauer their own vices
which every man af^ his own appetyte thinks to be venial / and al other
grievously abhor A great part of the^ which the co^mun people calls perfyte
and incorrupt / greatly defyeth theft / extorcio^ / murder / adultery /
incest: but single fornicacyon and moderate use of voluptuous plesures as a
small trespass they refuse not all. Some one man being unto all other things
incorrupt enough is somewhat a good drynker / is in riot and expenses somewhat
wastefull. An other is somewhat lyberall of his tongue. An other is combred with
vanite / vain glory and bosting. At the last what vice shall we lack if every
man after this manner shall favor his own vice? The Images of virtue.
It is an euyde^^ token that those men which favor any vice at all should not
truly possess the other virtues but rather some images of virtues which
either nature or bryngyng up / finally very custom has graffed in the minds
of the very gentiles. But he which with christen hatred abhors any one vice
/ must needs abhor al: for he whose mind true charity has ones possessed
hates indifferently the hole host of evil things / and flatereth not
himself so much as in venyal sins / leest he might fall a little and a little
from the smallest to the greatest: and while he is necligent in light things
might fall from the chefest things of al. Daily must somewhat of our euylles
be ^ake away / ^ of good things be added.
And though thou as yet can not pluck up by ye rotes the hole generacyon of
vices: nevertheless somewhat of our evil propertees must be plucked away day by
day / and so^thing added to good manners: af^ y^ manner diminissheth or
augmenteth y^ great hepe of Hesiodus.

The.xv. rule. Caplo.xxiiij.
IF the labor which thou must take in the conflict of te^ptacyon shall fear
the / this shall be a remedy. The bitterness of the fight must be compared with
the pain which follows the sin.
Se thou compare not the grefe of the fight with the pleasure of the sin: but
match me the p^sent bytternes of the fight with y^ bytternes of the sin
hereafter which follows him yt is overthrown: and than set the p^sent swetnes
of the sin which entyseth the / with the pleasure of the victory hereafter /
and with the tranquillite of mind which follows him y^ fights lustely: and
anon thou shall perceive how unequal a comparyson there shall be. But in this
thing they which be but little circu^spect are deceived / because they compare
the displeasure of the fight with the pleasure of the sin / and consider not
what follows the one and the other For there follows him which is ouerco^me
grefe both more paynfull a great deal and also of longer co^tynuau^ce than
he should have had in time of fight / if he had won the victory. And likewise
there follows the co^querours more pleasure by a great deal and of longer
endurau^ce than was the pleasure which carried him in to sin that was
ouerco^me. which thing he shall lightly judge / that has had the proof of
both. Prove ^otyme what it shall be to overcome.
But noman that is christened ought to be so outryght a cowarde though he were
daily subdued of temptacyon / but that he should ones at the leest do his
endeuoyre to prove what thing it is to ouerco^me temptacyon / which thing
the oftener he shall do / the pleasaunter shall the victory be made unto him.

The.xvj. rule. Caplo.xxv.
BUt if at any time it shall fortune the to receive a deedly wound / beware
leest by and by (thy shield cast away and wepons forsaken) thou yield thy self
to thine enemies hands / which thing. I have perceived to happen unto many
/ whose minds naturally are somewhat feeble and soft without resistance /
Dyspayre not though thou be over come.
y^ after they were ones overthrown / they seaced to wrestle any more / but
permitted and gave themself altogyder unto affections / never thynkyng any
more to recover their liberty again. To to much perilous is this weyknes of
spirit / which now and tha^ though it be not coupled with y^ worst wits in
y^ world / yet is it wont to bring to y^ point which is worste of all / to
desperacion verily. Against this weyknes therefore thy mind must be aforehande
armed with this rule / that after we have fallen in to sin not only we
should not despair / but cou^terfeyte bold men of war / whom not seldom
shame of rebuke and grefe of the wound received not only puts not to
flight but sharpeneth and refressheth again to fight more fyersly tha^ they
did before. A fall sometime courageth a man to wrastell more strongly.
In like case also after yt we have been brought in to deedly sin / let us
haste anon to come again to our self and to take a good heart to us / and
to repair again y^ rebuke and shame of the fall with new courage and lustynes
of strength. Thou shall heal one wound sooner tha^ many: thou shall easlier
cure a fresshe wound than that which is now old and putrifyed. Comfort thy
self with that famous verse which Demostenes is said to have used. A man that
flees will yet fight again. Call to remembrance David the prophet / Salomo^
the king / Peter a capteyn of the church / Paul the apostle / so great
lyghtes of holiness: in to what great sins for all yt fell they? Which all
peradventure even for this cause god suffered to fall / leest thou when thou
had fallen sholdest despeyre: rise up again therefore upon thy fete but that
quickly and with a lusty courage / and go to it a fresshe / both fyerser and
also more circumspect. It happens sometime that deedly offenses grow to good
men in to a heap of virtuous living / while they love more fervently which
erred most shamefully.

The.xvij. rule. Caplo.xxvj.
BUt against sundry and diverse assautes of the tempter thine ennemy / sundry
and diverse remedies are very mete and co^uenyent. The cross of Christ.
Nevertheless the only and chief remedy which of all remedies is of most
effycacye and strength against all kinds either of aduersite or else
temptacyon is the cross of Christ. The which self same is both an ensample
to them that go out of the way / and a refresshyng to them that labor / and
also armure or harneys to them y^ fight. This is a thing to be cast against
all manner wepons and bars of our most wicked enemy. And therefore it is
necessary to be exercised diligently therein / not after the co^mun manner / as
some men repete daily the hystory of the passion of Christ / or honor the
image of the cross / or with a thousand signs of it arm all their body
round on every side / or keep some piece of that holy tree laid up at home in
their house / or at certain hours so call to remembrance Christ's punysshment
/ that they may have co^passyon and weep for him with natural affection / as
they would for a man that is very just and suffers great wrong unworthily.
The very ^rnte of the cross is mortifyenge of our me^bres that is to say of
our passions and affeccions bodyly.
This is not the true fruit of that tree: nevertheless let it in the mean
season be the milk of y^ souls which be yonglynges and weyke in Christ. But
clyme thou up in to the date tree / that is to say the tree of vyctorie / that
thou may take hold of the true fruytes thereof. These be the chief if we
which be members shall endeuoyre our self to be semblable unto our heed in
mortifyenge our affectyons / which be our members upon the earth / which
thing unto us ought only to be nothing bitter / but also very plesau^t and
fervently to be desired / if so be the spyrite of Christ live in us. For who
loves truly and hertyly that person to whom he reioyseth to be as unlike as
may be / and in living and conuersacyon clean contrary? Not withstanding that
thou may the more profit / in thy mind record the mystery of the cross.
It shall be houefull that every man prepare unto him self a certain way and
godly craft of fyghtyng and therein dyligently exercise / that as soon as need
shall require it may be ready at hand. Such may y^ craft be / that in
certifyeng of every thine affectyous thou may apply that part of the
cross which most specially thereto agrees: for there is not at all any
either te^ptacion either aduersyte which has not his propre remedy in the
cross. As when thou art tyckled with ambycion of this world / when thou art
ashamed to be had in derisyon and to be set at naught: Affeccions are this wise
crucyfyed.
consydre thou than most vile membre how great Christ thy heed is / and unto
what vileness he humbled him self for thy sake. Nota.
when the yuell of envy inuadeth thy mind / remember how kyndly / how
lovingly he bestowed himself every whyt unto our use and profit / how good he
is even unto the worste. when thou art moved with glutteny / have in mind how
hedranke gall with eysell. when thou art tempted with filthy pleasure / call to
remembrance how far from al manner of pleasure the hole life of thy heed was
/ and how full of inco^modytes / vexacyon / and grefe. when ire provoke the
/ let him come immedyatly to thy mind / which like a lamb before the
shearer held his peace and opened not his mouth. If pouertye wring the yuell
/ or covetousness disquyet the / anon let him be rolled in thy mind that is
the lord of all things / and yet was made so poor and nedy for thy sake that
he had not whereupon to rest his heed. And after the same manner if thou shall do
in alother temptacions also / not only it shall not be grievous to have
oppressed thyn affectyons but surely plesaunt and delectable / for because thou
shall perceive that thou by this means art co^formed and shapen like unto thy
heed / and that thou do as it were recompense him for his infynyte sorrows /
which for thy sake he suffered unto the vttermoste.

The.xviij. rule. capi.xxvij.
ANd verily this manner of remedy / though it alone of all remedies be most
present and ready / most sure and quick in werkynge to the^ which be meanly
entered in the way of living / never the less to the weaker sort these
things also shall somewhat profit: Consydre the fylthynes of sin ^ the
dignyte of man.
if when affectyon moves unto iniquyte / than atones they call before the eyes
of the mind how fylthy / how abhomynable / how mischeuous a thing sin
is: on the other side how great is the dignyte of man. In tryfles and matters
such as skylleth not if all the world knew / we take some delyberacyon and
aduysement with our self. In this matter of all matters most weyghty and worthy
to be pondred / before y^ with consent as with our own hand writing we bind
our self to the fend / shall we not reken and account with our mind of how
noble a crafts man we were made / in how excellent estate we are set / with
how exceeding great price we are bought / unto how great felycyte we are
called / and that man is that gentle and noble creature for whose sake only god
has forged the meruaylous buyldyng of this world / that he is of the company
of angels / the son of god / the heir of immortalyte / a membre of Christ
/ a membre of the church / that our bodies be ye temple of the holy ghost /
our minds the images and also y^ secret habytacions of the deite. And on
the other side that sin is the most fylthy pestylence and consumpcyon both of
the mind and of the body also / for both of them through innocencye springs
anewe into their own natural kind / and through co^tagyon of sin both
putrifye and rotte even in this world. Sin is that deedly poison of the
most filthy serpent / the pressed wagest of the dyuell / and of that service
which is not most fylthy only / but also most miserable. After thou have
consydred this and such like with thy self / pondre wisely and take sure
aduysement and delyberacion whether it should be wisely done or no for an
apparaunt momentanye and poisoned little short pleasure of sin / to fall
from so great dignyte in to so vile and wretched estate / from whence thou
cannest not rydde and deliver thy self by thine own power and help.

The nyntenth rule. capi.xxviij.
EUethermore compare together those two capitaynes by them self most contrary
and unlike / god and the dyuell / of which the one thou make thine enemy
when thou synnest / and the other thy lord and master. Through innocence and
grace thou art called in to y^ nombre of the friends of god / art elect unto
the right title and inherytaunce of the sons of god. By sin verily thou
art made both the bond servant and son of the dyuell. we must have (...)
mind the benefycens of god and the maly fr^ens or noysaunce of the devil.
The one of them is that eternal fountain and origynall patron and true
ensample of very and sure beauty / of very true pleasure / of most perfyte
goodness mynistryng him self to all things. The other is father of all
mischefe / of extreme fylthynesse / of uttermost infelycite. Remember the
benefytes and goodness of the one done to the / and the yuell deeds of the
other. with what goodness has the one made the? with what mercy redeemed the?
with what liberty and fredom endued the? with what tenderness daily suffers
he and sustayneth the a wretched sinner / patiently abydyng and lokyng for
amendment? with what joy and gladness does he receive the amended / and when
thou art come again to thyselfe? Contrary to all these things with how
natural hate and envy long ago did y^ dyuell lay wait to thy health? Into
what grievous and combrous vexacion has he cast the / and also what other thing
ymagyneth he daily but to draw all mankind with him in to eternal mischefe.
All these things on this side and that side well and substancyally wayed and
pondred / thus think with thy self: shall I unmindful of mine origynall
beginning from whence I came / unmindful of so great and manyfolde benefytes /
for so small a morsel of feigned and false pleasure / unkindly depart from so
noble from so loving / from so benefyciall a father / and shall mancypate and
make myself bond wyllyngly unto a most fylthy and a most cruel master.
Shall I not at the leest way make good to the one that thing which I would
perform to a byle man / which had shewde kyndenesse / or done me any good?
Shall I not fly from ye other / which would fly from a man that coueyted or
were about to do me hurt?

The twenteth rule. capitulo. xxix.

be no less unequal than the capytaynes and gyuers of them be contrary and
unlike. For what is more unequal than eternal death and immortal life? than
without end to enjoy everlasting felycite and blyssednesse / in the company
and felowwip of the heavenly cytezyns / and without end to be tourmented and
punysshed with extreme vengeance / in the most unhappy and wretched company
of dampened souls? And who soever douteth of this thing he is not so much as
a man verily / and therefore he is no christian man. And who soever thinks not
on this / nor has it in remembrance / is even madder than madness itself.
Moreover and besides all this / virtue and wickydnesse has in the mean season
The fruytes of pity in this world.
even in this life their fruits very much unlike / for of ye one is reaped
assured tranquyllyte and quietness of mind / and that blyssed joy of pure
and clean conscience / which joy who so ever shall ones have tasted / there
is nothing in all this world so precious nor nothing so plesaunt / wherewith
he would be glad or desirous to change it. Contrarywyse there follows the
other / y^ is to say wickedness / a thousand other yuels / but most specially
that most wretched tourment and vexacyon of unclean conscience. That is that
hundredfolde reward of spyrituall joy which Christ promised in the gospel /
as a certain ernest or taste of eternal felycyte. These be those meruaylous
rewards that thapostle speaks of which eyt neither saw nor ear has herd
/ neither has sonke into the heart of any man which god has prepared for
them that love him / and verily in this life / when in the mean season the
worm of wicked men dies not / and they suffer their hell pains here even in
this world. The fruit of sin in this world.
Neither any other thing is that flambe in which is turmented the rich
glutton of whom is made mencyon in the gospel: neither any other things be
those punysshmentes of them in hell of whom the poets write so many things /
save a perpetual grefe / unquietness or gnawynge of the mind which
acompanyeth ye custom of sin. He y^ will therefore let him set aside the
rewards of ye life to come / which be so diverse and unlike: yet i this life
virtue has anexed to her wherefore she habu^dantly ought to be desired / and
vice has copled unto him for whose sake he ought to be abhorred.

The.xxi. rule. capi.xxx.
MOre over consider how full of grefe and mysery how short and transitory is
this present life / how on every side death lies in awayte against us how
euerywhere he catches us suddenly and unware. And when no man is sure no not
of one moment of life / how great peril it is to prolonge and continue that
kind of life in which (as it often fortuneth) if sudden death should take
the thou were but lost and undone for ever.

The.xxij. rule. capi.xxxj.
Besides all this impenytency or obduracyon of mind is to be feared of all
myschefes the extreme and worste: namely if a man would pondre this one thing
of so many / how few there be which trewly and with all their hertes come to
them self again / and be clean converted from sin / and with due
repentance reconsyled to god again: specially of them which have drawn
alonge the lives of iniquyte even unto the last end of their life. Slypper
verily and easy is the fall or discente in to fylthynesse / but to return
back again therhence / and to escape up unto spyrituall light / this is a
work / this is a labor. Therefore at the leestway thou being monisshed and
warned by the chance of Esop^s got / before thou disce^de in to the pyt of
sin / remebre that there is not so easy coming back again. The fox and the
got descended both in to a pyt to drink / wha^ they had broke they could not
get out again / the fox bad the got to sto^de up against the wall / and the
fox lept upon his back and so up / promising before to pull up the got after

answered a got got if thou had had as much wit in thy head as thou have
here in thy berde thou would not have e^tred in except thou had known
how to come out.


Remedies against certain sins and special vices / and first against bodyly
lust. capi.xxxij.
HItherto have we verily opened and declared (how soever it be done) comen
remedies against all kind of vices. Now we shall assay to give also certain
special and pertyculer remedies / how and by what means thou ought
withstand every vice and sin / and first of all how thou may resyst the
lust of the body. Than the which yuell there is none other yt sooner inuadeth
us / neither sharper assayleth or vexes us / nor extends larger nor draws
mo unto their utter distructyon. If at any time therefore filthy lust shall
stir thy mind / with these wepons and armoure remember forthwith to me^e him
/ first think how uncleanly / how filthy / how unworthy for any man what
soever he be ye pleasure is which assimuleth and makes us yt be a divine work
/ egall not to beestes only / but also unto fylthy swyne / to gotes / to dogs
/ and of all brute beestes / unto ye most brute / ye which ^atderforth casts
down far under the condycion and state of beestes us which be appointed unto
y^ company of angels and feloushyp of ye deite. wepo^s against bodyly lust.
Let come to thy mind also how momentany the same is / how vnpure / how ever
having more aloes than of honey. Aloes is a bitter thing and is put for
bytternes.
And on ye contrary side how noble a thing the soul is / how worshypfull a
thing y^ body of a man is / as I have rehearsed in the rules above. What y^
deuyls peuysshnesse is it tha^ for so little / so uncleanly tyclyng of mome^tany
pleasures to defyle at one time both soul and body with ungoodly manners? to
profane and pollute that temple which Christ has co^^ecrate to him self
with his blood? Co^sydre y^ also what an hepe of mischeuous inco^modytes that
flatryng pleasant pestyle^ce brinketh with him. The inco^modites of bodyly
^uste.
First of al it pulls from ye thy good fame / a possession faraway most
precious / for y^ ^umour of no vice stynketh more carenly that y^ name of
lechery: it co^sumeth thy patrimony / it kylleth atones both the strength and
also the beauty of y^ body / it decays and greatly hurts health / it
enge^dreth diseases innumerable and the^ filthy / it disfygureth y^ flour of
youth long before y^ day / it hastes or accelerateth ryueled and yuell
favored age / it takes away the quycknesse and strength of the wit / it
dulleth ^he sight of the mind / and graffeth in a man as it were a beestly
mind / it withdraws atones from all honest / studyes and pastymes / and
plungeth and sowseth a man euerywhyt in the podle and mire be he never so
excellent / that now he has lust to think on nothing but yt which is
sluttysshe / vile / and filthy: and it takes away the use of reason which
was the natyue property of man / it makes youth mad / peuysshe / and
sclau^drous / and age odyous / fylthy / and wretched. Bewyse therefore and on
this wise reken with thyselfe name by name / this and that pleasure came so
yuel to pass / brought with her so much loss / so much disworshyp /
dishonor and dishonesty / so much tedyousnesse / labor and disease: and shall
I now a fool most natural deuowre y^ hoke wetyngly? shall I again committee
that thing whereof I should repent of fresshe? And likewise refrain thy self
by the ensample of other men / which thou haste known to have followed
voluptuous pleasures fylthely and unfortunately. Refrain thy self by the
ensample of other me^
On the other side courage and bold thy self unto chastyte by thensamples of so
many young men / of so many young and tender virgynes norisshed up delycately
and in pleasures: And (the cyrcu^stances compared together) lay against
thyselfe thy sluggyshnesse / why thou at the last should not be able to do
that thing which such and such / of that kind or sex / of that age / so
borne / so brought up were and yet be able to do? Love as much as they did /
and thou shalt be able to do no less than they did. Think how honest / how
plesaunt / how lusty and florysshyng a thing is pureness of body and of mind
/ she most of all makes us acquaynted and famylyer with angels / and apt to
receive the holy ghost: for verily that noble spyrite the lover of pureness /
so greatly flees back from no vice at all as from uncleanliness / he rests
and sporteth him nowhere so much as i^pure virgyns minds. Set before thine
eyes how ungoodly it is / how altogyder a mad thing to love / to wax pale /
to be made lean / to The ungoodly office of lovers
weep / to flatter / and shamfully to submyt thy self unto a stynkyng harlot
most fylthy and rotten / to gape and sing all night at her chamber wyndowe /
to be made to the lure and be obedyent at a beck / nor dare do any thing

with thy self / how great a flock of myscheues voluptuousness (if she be
let in) is wont to bring with her. Other vices peradventure have some
acquayntaunce with certain virtues / fylthy lust has none at all / but is
anexed and always coupled with those sins that be greatest and most in nombre.
Let it be but a tryfle or a light ma^er to follow queens / yet is it a grievous
thing not to regard thy father and mother / to set at naught thy friends / to
consume thy fathers good in waste / to pluck away from other men / to
forswear thy self / to drink all night / to rob / to use wytchcraft / to

has taken away any sometime of thine acquayntaunce / of thy famylyer friends
/ of thy company ons / or else of them which were younger than thou: and most
specially of them which in time passed thou have had fellows of fylthy
pastyme. And learn of another man's peril to be more ware and cyrcumspecte.
Remember how delycyously they lived / but how bytterly they departed: how
late they waxed wise / how late they began to hate their mortyferous and
deedly pleasures. The straytnes of the extreme judgment.
Let come to remembrance the sharpness of the extreme judgment / and the
terryble lightening of that fearful sentence never to be revoked / sendyng
wicked men in to eternal fire / and that this pleasure of an hour / short and
little / must be punysshed with eternal tourmentes. In this place wey
dylygently in a pair of balaunces / how unequal a change it is for the most
fylthy and very short delectacyon of lust / both to lose in this life the joy
of the mind being much sweter The joys of pure mind is much sweter than is
the pleasure of sin.
and more excellent / and in the life to come to be spoiled of joys
everlasting. Moreover with so shadowlyke and little vain pleasure to purchase
sorrows never to be ended. Finally if it seem a hard thing to dispyse yt so
small delectacion for Christ's sake / remember what pains he took upon him for
y^ tender love he bare to the. And beside the comen iniuryes of man's life /
how much of his holy blood shed he / how shamfull / how bitter death
suffered he / and all for the. And thou of all those things unmindful
crucifyest again the son of god / iterating a fressh those mad pleasures
which caused and compelled thy heed and lord unto so cruel tourmentes. The
benefits of god.
Than acordyng to ye rule above rehearsed / call to mind how much of
benefytes he heaped on the / when as yet thou had deserved nothing at all:
for the which although no suffycient or like recompense can be made of thy
part for the leest / yet desires he again none other thank but that thou

pleasures / and turn the unto the love Uenus is the gods of love and she is
put ^or love.
of infynyte goodness and of infynyte pleasures and beautye. Cupydo is the god
of love / and is also put for love.
Compare together these two / Uenus and two Cupydes of Plato / that is to say
honest love and fylthy love / holy pleasure and uncleanly pastyme / compare
together the unlike matter of either other. Here is a good note for every
christen man.
Compare the natures / compare the rewards: and in all te^ptacyons / but
namely when thou art stered to fylthy lust / set to the before thine eyes thy
good angel which is thy keeper and co^tynuall beholder and wytnes of al
things thou do or thynkest / and god ever lokyng on / unto whose eyes all
things are open which sytteth above the heuens and beholds the secret
places of the earth: and will not thou be afraid before the angel present
and even hard by the / before god / and all the company of heaven loking on and
abhorryng to committee a thing so abhomynable and fylthy that it would shame y^
to do the same in the p^sence of one vile man? This thing I would thou
sholdest think as it is in deed. And if it were so y^ thou had eyes much
sharper of sight tha^ has a be called lynxe Lynxe is a bes^ of most puryst
sight among all beestes.
/ or much clerer than has y^ egle / yet with these eyes in ye most clerest
light y^ could be / coudest thou not behold more surely that thing which a
man does before the than all the preuy and secret parts of thy mind be open
unto the sight of god and of his angels. Obstynacy of a froward mind
springs o^ bodyly lust.
This also count in thy mind when thou art ouerco^me of bodyly lust / of two
things the one must follow / either that volupt^^ ousnes ones tasted so shall
enchau^t and darken thy mind / that thou must go from fylthines to filthiness /
until thou clean blinded shall be brought in sensu^ reprobu^ / that is to say
/ in to a lewd and reproved judgment: and so made obstynate and sturdy in
evil cannest not / no truly not than yield up filthy pleasure when she has
forsaken the / which thing we se to have happened to very many / that wha^
the body is wasted / when beauty is wythered and vanisshed / when the blood is
cold / wha^ strength fails / and the eyes wax dym / yet still contynually
they ytche without seassynge. And with greater mischefe are now fylthy spekers
than before time / they have been vnshameful lyuers / than which thing what can
be more abhomynable and monstrous? The other is if peradventure it shall happen
the by the special favor of god to come again to thy self. Than must that
short and fugityue pleasure be purged with very great sorrow of mind / with
mighty and strong labor / with co^tynuall stremes of tears: how much more
wisdom therefore is it not to receive at all the poison of carnal pleasure /
than either to be brought in to so incurable blyndnes / or else to recompense
so little / and that also false pleasure with so great greuau^ce and dolorous
pain More over thou may take many things of the circumstaunce of thine own
person / which might call the back from voluptuous pleasure. A priest.
Thou art a priest remember that thou art all together consecrate to things
perteynynge unto god: what a myscheuous deed / how ungoodly / how unmeet / and
how unworthy it should be to touch the rotten and stynkynge flesh of an hoar
with that mouth wherewith thou receyuest that precious body so greatly to be
honored / and to handell loathsome and abhomynable fylth with the same hands
wherwithall (even the aungelles mynystrynge to the and assystynge the) thou
executest that ineffable and incomprehensyble mysterye. If thou b^ learned.
How these things agree not to be mabe one body and one spirit with god / and
to be made one body with an hoar. If thou be learned / so much the nobler and
lyker unto god is thy mind / and so much the more unworthy of this shame and
rebuke. If thou be a gentylman A gentylman.

A short recapitulacyon of remedies against the flame of lust. Capi.xxxiij.
FInally to make a short and compendious conclusyon / these be the most
special things which will make the sure from pleasures and entyfynges of the
flesh / first of all circu^specte / and diligent avoiding of all occasyons
Auoydyng occasyons.
/ which precepte though it be mete to be observed also in other things /
because that he which loves perils is worthy to perisshe therein yet these
be most chefely those Syrenes Syrenes be ^ere mayde^s.
which almoost never man at all has escaped / save he which has kept far
of. Secondly moderacyon of eating and drynkyng and of sleep / temperaunce and
abstynence from pleasures / ye from such as be lawful and permytted: the
regard of thine own death / and the contemplacyon of ye death of Christ / and
those things also will help if thou shall live with such as be chaste and
uncorrupted: if thou shalt eschew as a certain pestylence the co^munycacion
of corrupt and wanton persons: if thou shalt flee idle solytarynesse and
sluggysshe ydlenes: if thou shalt exercise thy mind strongly in the
medytacyon of celestyall things / and in honest studyes. But specially if thou
shalt consecrate thy self with all thy might unto the inuestygacyon or
searching of mysteryes of holy scripture: if thou shalt pray both often and
purely / most of all when temptacyon inuadeth and assawteth the.

Against the entysynges and prouokynges unto auaryce. Capi.xxxiiij.
IF thou shall perceive that thou art either by nature any thing enclyned to
the vice of auaryce Auaryce.
/ or stered by the devil: call to remembrance (according to the rules above
rehearsed) the dignite of thy condycyon or state / which for this thing only
wast created / for this redeemed / that thou ever sholdest enjoy that infynyte
good thing god / for god has forged all ye hole buyldyng of this world that
all things should obey unto thy use and necessite. How fylthy than and of how
strayte and narowe a mind is it not to use but so greatly to wonder at things
dombe and most vile: take away the error of men / what shall gold and
silver be but reed ^^th and white? Shalt thou be the discyple of poor Christ
and called to a better possessyon / wonder at that as a certain great and
excellent thing which no philosopher of the gentyles did not set at naught?
not to possess riches / but to despise riches is a noble thing. To despise
riches is a noble thing.
But the co^munalte of christen men by name only cry out against me / and be
glad to deceive them self most craftily: very necessite (say they) co^pelleth
us to gader good together / whereof if there should be none at all / than could
we not ones live verily: if it should be thynne and poor / than should we live
in much mysery without pleasure. But and if it be somewhat clean and honest /
and somewhat ple^teous withal / it brings many co^modytees to man. Christ in
the gospel of Mathewe leest his discyples should care for meet drink or
clothes / bad them to behold the lyiys how they were dothed and the birds how
they were fed saye^s / if your father of heaven make prouysyo^ for so vile
things much more ye can not lack whom he loves so syngulerly.
The good lyking of body is well seen unto / prouysyon is made for our children
/ we lend and profit our friends / we are delivered from co^tempte and be the
more set by: in conclusion also a man shall have ye better name when he is
somewhat welthy. Of a great many thousands of christen men thou can scarce
find one or two yt does not both say and think the same. Nevertheless to
answer these men unto both parts. First of al because they cloak their
covetousness with the name of necessite / I will lay against them the parable
rehearsed in the gospel of the lylies and of ye birds lyuynge^ from day to day
without farther prouysion / whose ensample Christ exhorts us to cou^terfeyte.
I will lay against them that the same Christ would not ones suffer so much as a
scrippe to be carried about of his discyples. I will lay against them / yt he
commands us (all other things laid aparte) before all things to seek the
kingdom of heaven / and promyseth that all things shall be cast and given to
us. when at any time had not they things necessary to maynteyn life withal
sufficiently / which with all their hertes have given themself to virtue and
to the true life of a christian man? And how small a thing is that which nature
requires of us? but thou measurest necessite not by ye needs of nature / but
by ye bounds of covetousness. But unto good men even that is enough that
scarsely co^tenteth nature. Friars.
How be it verily I do not so greatly set of these which forsake at one choppe
their hole substance every whyt that they might ye more shamefully beg of
other. It is none offense to possess money / but to love and set store by
money that is a vice and cosyn to sin. If riches flow unto the / use the
office of a good dispe^ser: but and if it ebb and go away / be not consumed
with thought / as though thou were robbed of a great thing / but rather
rejoice that thou art delivered of a perylous fardell. Notwithstanding he
which consumes the chief study and pastyme of his life in heapyng up riches
together / which gapeth at them as a certain excellent or noble thing / and
hyghly to be desired / and lays them up i^ store / that he may have enough to
serve him for long time / ye though he should live even to the age of Nestor:
Nestor lived three hundred years.
this man peradventure may well be called a good merchant / but verily I would
not say that he were a very good christian man / that hangs all together of
himself / and has dystruste of the promesses of Christ / whose goodness / it
is easy to wit / shall not fail a good man puttyng his trust in him / seeing
that he so liberally both fedeth and clotheth the poor sparowes. But let us
now cast a comptes of the co^modytees / which riches is byleued to bring with
him. First of al even by the common consent of ye gentyle philosophers: Riches
among profitable things obtain the lowest rowme.
among the good things which are called Bona vtilia / that is to say / good
profitable things / riches has the lowest place. And when all other things
(after the dyuysyon of Epictetus) are without man / except only virtue of the
mind: yet nothing is so much without us as money is / nothing brings so
little co^modite. For what so ever there is anywhere of gold / what so ever
there is of precious stones / if thou alone had it every deal in thy
possessyon / shall thy mind be therefore the better by the valor of one hear?
Riches helps nothing to virtue.
shall thou be the wyser? shall thou be the connynger? shalt thou be anywhyt
the more in good health of body? shall it make the more strong and lusty? more
fair and beauteous? more young? No trewly. But you will say that it purchases
pleasures / truth it is: but they be deedly pleasures To false pleasures and
vain honors they help somewhat
/ it geteth a man honor: but what honor I pray you? verily false honor /
which they give / that prayseth nothing / sets by nothing but only
folysshe things / and of whom to be praised / is well nere to be dispraysed.
True honor is / to be lauded of them which are commendable and praise worthy
them selves. The highest honor honor is the reward of virtue / and not of
riches.
that can be / is to have pleased Christ. True honor is / the reward / not
of riches / but of virtue. The folysshe people gives the rowme and place /
gaseth upon the / and gives the honor and reverence. O fool / they wonder
at thine apparayle / and honors it / and not the: why do thou not
descend in to thine own conscience / and consider the miserable pouerte of
thy mind? which if the common people saw / than would they judge the as
miserable and wretched / as they now call the happy and blessed But good geteth
friends. I grant / but yet feigned and false friends: neither geteth it
friends to the but to it self. And certeynly the rich man is in this point of
al men most unfortunate and wretched / because he can not so much as discern
or know his true friends and lovers from other. One hates him privily and
secretly in heart and mind as an hard nyggarde. Riches geteth fre^des but
those false and feigned.
An other has envy at him / because he passes him in riches. An other lokyng
to his own profit and auau^tage / flatereth him / and holds up his ye and
his nay / and smyleth upon him / to the end that he may scrape and get some
thing from him. He that before his face is most loving and kind / wyssheth and
prays for his quycke and hasty death. There is none that loves him so hertely
and entyerly / but that he had lever have him deed than alive. No man is so
famylyar with him / y^ he will tell him the truth. But be it in case there
were one special friend among a thousand that loved a rich man hertely
without any manner of faynynge / yet can not the rich man but have in suspicion
and mystrust every man. He judges all men to be vultures and ravenous vyrdes
gaping for careyn: he thinks all men to be flies flyng to him / to suck out
some profyt of him for themselves. what so ever co^modite therefore riches
seems to bring / it for ye most part / or else all together is but colored
and deceytfull / it is shadow like and full of del^syon / apperyng otherwise
than it is in very deed. But they bring very many things which are evil in
deed / and takes away very many of these things which are good in very deed.
Therefore if thou will lay accomptes well and perfytly of that which is won
/ and that which is lost: doubtless thou shall find that they never do bring
so much of co^moditees / but yt they draw with them to to much more of
inco^modytees and displeasures. with how paynfull and sore labors are they
gotten / and with how great ieopardies? with how great thought and care be they
kept? with how great heaviness and sorrow are they lost? for which causes
Christ calls them yea thorns wherefore Christ compares riches to thor^
/ because they rent / tear and pluck in sonder all the tranquillite and
quietness of the mind / with a thousand cares / than the which tranquillite
of mind / nothing is to man more sweet and pleasant / and they never quench
thurst and desire of themself / but kendleth and increases it more and more.
They drive ^ man hedlonge in to all mischefe. Neither flatter thy self in
vain / saying nothing forbyddeth but that a man at one time may be both rich
and good. Remember what verite says / that it is more easy for a camel to
crepe through the eye of a nedle than a rich man to enter in to the kingdom of
heaven. It is hard for a rich man to be a good man
And plainly without excepcio^ true is that saying of saint Jerome A rich man
to be either unjust him self or the heir of an unjust man: great riches can
never be either gotten or else kept without sin. Remember of how much
better riches they rob the / for he hates the very taste and smell of virtue
/ he hates al honest crafts / who so ever sets his (...) upon gold. (...)
More over the vice of auaryce only is called ydolatry of Paul. (...)
Neither with any other vice at all Christ has less aqueintau^ce / neither ye
self same person can please god and maminon also.

THou shall lightly therefore seace to wonder at money if thou wylt ponder and

Against ambicyon or desire of honor and authorite. Capi.xxxvj.
IF at any time ambicio^ shall combre and vex thy mind through her
enchau^tementes / with these remedies thou shall arm thyself before hand
without tarying (according to y^ rules which I gave before) take and hold this
with toth and nail / yt to be honor honor spryngeth of virtue only.
only which springs of true virtue / which self same nevertheless a man
must sometime refuse / even as taught us both with doctrine and ensample our
master Jesus Christ. And this to be the chief honor and only honor which a
chryste^ man should desire and wysshe for / to be praised not of men / but of
god / for whom he comme^deth (as says the apostle) that man is perfyte and
worthy of honor in deed. It is an honest thing to be l^nded of god.
But if honor be given of man for an ungoodly and dishonest thing / and so of
ungoodly persons. This is not honor but great dishoneste / shame and rebuke.
if for any mean and indifferent thing / as for beauty / strength / riches /
kynne: Honor gyu^^^ of dishonest persons.
yet verily shall it not be called truly honor / for no man deserves honor
with y^ thing whereof he deserves not to be praised. If for an honest thing
in deed it shall be honor: yet he which deserves it shall not desire it / but
verily shall be content with y^ very virtue and conscience of his good deed.
Behold therefore how folysshe and how worthy to be laughed at these honors be
/ for whose desire the comen people so greatly burn and rage. First of all of
whom are they given? honor given of come^ people
Trewly of them with whom is no difference between honesty and dishonesty.
wherefore are they given? very often for mean things / now and than for fylthy
things. To whom? to him which is unworthy. who soever therefore gives honor
either he does it sor fear / and than is he to be feared again / or because
thou would do him a good turn / and than he mocketh the: or because he is
astonyed at things of naught and worthy of no honor / and than he is to be
pityed: or because he supposed the to be moved with such things as honor is
given of duty / wherein if he be disceyued / give dilygence that thou may be
that he supposes the^ to be. But and if he hit aright / refer all the honor
y^ is offered the unto him to whom thou art bound / ye for all those things
whereunto the honor is given. As thou ought not ascrybe to thine own self
the virtue / so is it vnsyttyng to take upon the the honor thereof. Besides
this what is greater madness than to esteem the valor of thyselfe by
thopinyo^s of folysshe To whom honor cha^iceth to most come^ly.
me^ / in whose hands it lies to take away again when so ever they list the
very same honor which they give / and dishonest the which was even now
honested. Therefore nothing can be more folysshe than either to rejoice for
such honors when they happen / or to be sorry or mourn when they be taken
away / which not to be true honors thou shalt perceive at the leest way by
this probacion and argument / for so much as they be comen to the worste and
leudest persons of all: ye they chance almost to none more plentuously than to
them which of true honors be most unworthy. The quyetnes of a pryuate life.
Remember how blyssed is the quietness of a mean life both private / that is
to say / charged with no comen business / and separate and removed out of the
way from al noise / haunte / or preasse. On the other side consider how full
of pricks how full of cares / of peryls / of sorrows / is the life of great
men / and what diffycultie it is not to forget thy self in prosperyte / how
hard it is for a man standing in a slypper place not to fall / how grievous
the fall is from an high. And remember that all honor is coupled with great
charge / and how strayte the judgment of ye high judge shall be against them
which here in vsurpyng of honors / prefer them self before other men. For
surely who so ever shall humble and submyt him self / him as an innocent or
harmless person mercy shall socour: but who soever exalts himself as a
perfyte man / y^ same person excludes from himself the help and socour of
grace. Let it not exalt thy mind by cause thou b^^ re^t rule over other men.
Let ever the ensample of Christ thy heed stycke fast in thy mind. what
thing as touching to the world was more vile / more dispysed or less
honored than he? How forsook he honors wha^ they were profred him / which
was greater than any honor? How set he no store of honors when he rode upon
an ass? How condemned he the^ when he was clothed in pall and crowned with
thorn? How vnglorious or vile a death chose he? But whom the world dispysed
him the father glorified. Let thy glory be in the cross of Christ / in whom
also is thy health / welthe / saving / defense and protectyon. what good shall
worldly honors do to the if god cast the away and dispyse the / and the
angels loathe / abhor / and defye the.

Against elacyon otherwise called pride or swellyng of the mind. capi.xxxvij.
THou shalt not swell in thy mind if (acordyng to the comen proverb used of
every man) thou would know thyselfe: Know thyselfe.

what soever excellent thing is in the / thou account that to be the gift of
god / and not thy good. On the othersyde / if what soever is low or vile /
what soever is foul or filthy / what soever is shreude or yuell thou ascrybe
that altogyther unto thine own self: if thou remember in how much fylthe
thou were conceived / in how much borne how naked / how nedy / how
brutisshe / how wretched / how miserably thou crepest in to this light. If
thou remember in to how many diseases or sickness on every side / unto how
many chaunses / unto how many encombraunces / greues / and troubles this

Pondre also this / what manner thing that is whereof thou take upon the: if

it is madness: if an an honest thing / it is unkindness. Remember also
nothing to be a more sure document or proof of stark folysshnesse and lack of
understanding / than if a man stand greatly in his own co^ceyte. And again
that no kind of folly is more incurable / if thy mind begin to arise and wax
great because a vile man submytteth himself to the. Think how much greater
and myghtyer god ha^geth over thine heed / which crussheth down every proud

pride. And these things also shall be good though they seem somewhat as they were
tryfles / if thou would compare thy self always with excellenter persons.
Thou lykest thy self because of a little beauty of thy body: compare thy self
to the^ which in beauty be far before the. A little co^nyng makes the to set
up thy feathers / turn thine eyes unto them in comparyson of whom thou may
seem to have learned nothing at all. Moreover if thou wylt acompt not how much
of good things thou have / but how much thou lackest: And with Paul
forgetful of those things which be behind the would stretche forth thy
self to tho things which remain before the. Furthermore that also shall not
be an unwise thing / if when the wind of pride does blow / by and by we
turn our very yuell things into a remedy / as it were expelling one poison
with another. Consydre thyn own vices and deformytes.
That thing shall this wise come to pass / if when any great vice or
defourmyte of body / when any notable damage either fortune has given / or
folly has brought to us which might gnawe us vehemently by the stomach / we
set that before our eyes / and by thensample of the pecocke we behold our
self chefely in that part of us in which we be most defourmed / and so shall
thy feathers fall forthwith and thy pride abate. ^rroga^cy / presumpcyon or
pertynacy / is ^ hated vice.
Beyond all these (besides yt none other vice is more hated unto god) remember
also that arrogancye / pride / and presumpcion is notably hated and had in
derisyon every where among men: when co^trarywyse lowlynesse and meekness /
both purchases the favor of god / and kutteth unto the the benyuolence of
man. Therefore to speak compendyously / two things chefly shall refrain the
from pride / if thou consydre what thou art in thyselfe / fylthy in thy birth
/ a burble (such as ryseth in the water) throughout all thy life / worms
meat in thy death / and what Christ was made for the.

Against wrath and desire of vengeance. capi.xxxviij.
When fervent sorrow of the mind wrath is a chyldyshe ^hynge.
styrreth the up unto vengeance / remember wrath to be nothing less than
that which it falsely cou^trefayteth / that is to wete fortytude or
manfulnesse: for nothing is so chyldysshe / so weak / nothing so feeble and of
so vile a mind as to rejoice in vengeance. Thou would be counted a man of
great stomach / and therefore thou suffer not iniurye to be vnauenged: but
in conclusyon by this means thou vtterest thy chyldysshnesse / seeing thou
cannest not rule thine own mind which is the very property and office of a
man. How much ma^lyer / how much excellenter is it to set another man's folly
at naught than to cou^trefayte it? Regard lyt^ll another man's folly.
But he has hurt the / he is proud and fierce / he scorneth the. The
fylthyer he is so much the more beware leest thou be made like him. what the
dyuelles madness is it that thou to avenge an other man's lewdness would be
made the leuder thy self. If thou dispyse the rebuke / all men shall perceive
y^ it was done to one unworthy thereof: but and if thou be moved thou shalt
make his quarrel which did the wrong much ye better. Furdermore take the
thing as it is / if any wrong be received / that is not eased one whyt with
vengeance but augmented. For in conclusyon what end shall there be of
iniuryes on both sides if every man go forth and proceed to revenge his own
grefe? Enemies encreace on both parts / the sorrow waxes fresshe and raw
again / and the longer it endures ye more incurable it is: but with softness
and with sufferaunce is healed now and than / ye even he which did the wrong
/ and after he is comen to himself again / of an enemy is made a very trusty
and faithful friend. But the very same hurt which by vengeance thou
coueytest to put from the / reboundeth back again upon the / and not without
encreace of harm. And that also shall be a sovereign remedy against wrath (if
according to the diuysyon of things above rehearsed) thou should consider y^
one man can not hurt another unless he will him self / save in those things
only which be outward goods / which so greatly prayne not unto man: for
the very good things of the mind god only is able to take away / which he
is not wont to do but unto unkind persons / and only he can give them /
which he has not used to do unto cruel and furyous persons. No christen man
therefore is hurt but of him self: Injury hurts no man but the worker
thereof. These things also help (though they be not weyghty) that thou shall
not follow the sorrow of thy mind. If the cyrcumstau^ces of retho^^iens well
gathered together thou both make light of thine own harms / and also mynysshe
y^ wrong done of an other man co^munly af^^ this manner. He hurt me / but it
will be soon amended. More over he is a child / he is of things inexpert / he
is a young man / it is a woman / he did it through an other man's mocyon or
counseyle / he did it unware / or when he had well droke / it is mete that I
forgive him. And on the other side he has hurt me grievously. Certain but he
is my father / my brother / my master / my friend / my wife / it is according
that this grefe should be forgyuen / either for the love / or else for the
authorite of the person. Or else thou shalt set one thing against an other /
and recompense y^ injury with other good benefytes done of him unto the. Or
with thine offenses done to him before season shall accou^te it even / and so
make quyte. This man has hurt me verily / but other times how often has he
done me good. It comes of an vnliberal mind to forgete y^ good benefytes and
only to remember a little wrong or displeasure. Now he has offended me / but
how often offended of me. I will forgive him / that he in likewise by mine
ensample may pardon me / if I an other time trespace against him. Finally it
shall be a remedy of much greater ^tue and of strong operacyon / if in the
mysdoyng of an other man against the thou dydest think in thy self / what
things / how grievous / and how often thou have sinned against god / how many
manner of ways thou art in debt to him: Forgive thy ^ettour.
as much as thou shall remyt unto thy brother which is in thy debt / so much
shall god forgive unto the. This way of forgyuynge other men's dettes has he
taught us which is him self a creditour / he will not refuse the law which he
him self made. To be absolved or losed from thy sins thou rennest to Rome /
saylest to saint James / byest perdons most large. I disprayse not verily that
thing which thou do: but when all is done / there is no redyer way / no
surer means whereby (if thou have offended) thou might come to favor /
again and be reconsyled to god / than if thou when thou art offended / be
reconsyled again unto thy brother / forgive a little trespace unto thy
neighbor (for it is but small what so ever one man trespaceth against an
other) that Christ may forgive the so many thousand offenses. By the ensample
of christ swa^^ the mind.
But it is hard (thou say) to subdue the mind when he begins to wax
hot. Remembrest thou not / how much harder things Christ suffered for the /
what were thou when he for thy sake bestowed his precious life? were thou not
his ennemy? with what softnes suffers he the daily repetyng thine old
sins? Last of all how mekely suffered he the uttermost rebukes / bonds /
strypes / finally death most shameful? why? why? boostest thou thy self of
the heed / if thou care not to be in the body? Thou shall not be a member of
Christ except thou follow ye steps of Christ. we must perdon the unworthy.
But he is unworthy to be forgyuen. Even so were not thou unworthy whom god
should forgive? In thine own self thou wylt have mercy exercised / and against
thy brother wylt thou use extreme and cruel justice? is it so great a thing if
thou being a sinner thy self sholdest forgive a sinner / when Christ prayed
his father for them which crucified him? is it an hard thing not to stryke
thy brother whom thou art also commanded to love? is it an hard thing not to
pay again an evil deed / for which except thou would recompense a good:
thou shall not be yt toward thy fellow y^ Christ was toward his servant?
Finally if this man be unworthy to whom for an evil turn a good should be
reco^penced / yet art thou worthy to do it / Christ is worthy for whose sake it
is done But in suffryng an old displeasure I call in a new / he will do
injury again if he should escape unpunished for this: if with out offense
thou can avoid / avoid it: if thou can ease or remedy it / ease it: if
thou can heal a mad man / heal him / if not let him perysshe himself alone
rather tha^ with the. This man which thinks him self to have done harm /
think thou worthy to be pytyed / and not to be punysshed. wylt thou be angry
to thy co^mendacion and laud? Be angry and agre^ed with the vice.
be angry with y^ vice / not with ye man But the more thou art inclined by
nature to this kind of vice / so much ye more diligently arm thy self long
before hand / and ones for altogyder prynt sure in thy mind this decre or
purpose: that thou neither say nor do any thing at any time while thou art
angry: bileue not thyself wha^ thou art moved: have suspected what so ever yt
sodeyn mocio^ or rage of y^ mind diffineth or judges / ye though it be
honest. Say nor do any thing if thou be angry
Remember none other difference to be bitwene a fra^tik person and him yt
rages in ire tha^ is between a short madness that dureth but a season and a
continual perseuera^t madness. Call to mind how many things in anger thou have
said or done worthy to be repented / which now though in vain thou would
feign were changed. Therefore when y^ wrath waxes hot and boyleth: if thou
ca^ not streightway (...) deliver thy self altogyder from anger^ at the leest
way come thus ferforth to thy self and sobrenesse that thou remember thy self
not to be well aduysed or in thy right mind: To remember this is a great part
of health. On this wise reason with thy self / now verily so am I minded / but
anon herafter I shall be of another mind much contrary / why should I in the
mean season say against my friend (while I am moved) that thing which
herafter when I am peased and my malice ceased I could not change: why
should I now do in my malice or anger yt thing which when I am sobred and
come to my self again I should greatly sorrow and repent. why rather should
not reason / why should not pytie / at the last why should not Christ obtain
that of me now / which a little pause of time shall shortly herafter obtain.
The mind must be hardened against wrath^.
To no man (I suppose) has nature given so much of black color but at the
leest way he might so ferforthe rule himself. But it shall be a very good thing
for y^ thus instructed to harden thy mind with reason / with co^tynuaunce and
custom that thou could not be moved at all: it shall be a perfyte thing /
if thou having indignacyon only at y^ vice / for a displeasure or rebuke done
to the / shall render again a deed of charity. To conclude / even natural
temperau^ce which ought to be in every man / requires that thou should not
suffer affectyons to rule the utterly. Not to be wroth atall / is a thing
most like unto god / and therefore most comely and beautyfull. To overcome yuel
with goodness / malice with kyndnesse / is to counterfayte the perfyte charity
of Christ Jesus. To hold wrath under and keep him back with a brydell / is
the property of a wise man. To follow the appetyte of wrath / is not a point
of a man verily / but plainly of beestes / and that of wild beesies. But if
thou would know how much uncomely it were to a man to be overcome with
wrath / look when thou art sobre that thou mark the countenance of an angry
person / or else when thou thy self art angry / go unto a glass. Behold thyn
own cou^tena^ce when thou art angrye.
wha^ thine eyes so burn flaming in fire / when thy chekes be pale / when thy
mouth is drawn awrye / thy lyppes foam / all thy members quake / when thy
voice sounds so malycyously / neither thy gestures be of one fassyon / who
would judge the to be a man? Thou perceyuest now my most swetest friend how
large a see is open all abroad to dispute of other vices after this same manner.
But we in the mids of our course will stryke sail leaving the rest to thy
discrecyon. Neither certain was it my mind / purpose / or intencyon (for that
should be an infynyte work) as I began / even so to dissuade the from every
vice / vice by vice / as it were with sundry declamacions Declamacions^

show a certain manner and craft of a new kind of war / how thou
myghtest arm thy self against the yuels of the old life burgynge for the
again and spryngyng a fresshe. Therefore as we have done in one or two things
(because of ensample) so must thou thy self do partly in every thing / one
by one: but most of all in the things whereunto thou shall perceive thy self
to be styrred or instygate peculyarly / whether it be through vice of nature /
custom / or yuell bringing up / against these things some certain decrees
must be written in the table of thy myn^e / and they must be remeued now and
than / leest they should fail or be forgoten through disuse / as against y^
vices of backbytyng / fylthy speaking / envy / gule / and other like: Certain
decrees m^st be written in our minds
these be y^ only enemies of Christ's sowdiours / against whose assawte the
mind must be armed long aforehande with prayer / with noble sayenges of wise
men / with ye doctrine of holy scripture / with ensample of devout and holy
men / and specially of Christ. Though I doubt not but that the redyng of holy
scripture shall mynister al these things to the habundau^tly / nevertheless
charity which one brother owes to another has moved and exhorted me that at
y^ leest way with this sudden and hasty writings / I should further and help
thy holy purpose as much as lies in me: why he wrote this book somewhat
quicklier and with more ^pede.
a thing which I have done somewhat the rather because I somewhat feared leest
thou should fall in to that superstycyous kind of religyous men / which
partly awaytyng on their own aduau^tage / partly with great zele / but not
acordyng to knowledge / walk round about both by see and land / and if
anywhere they get a man recoueryng from vices unto virtue / him straight way

cowle there were no christendom. Relygyous men.
Furthermore when they have filled his breast with pure scripulosyte and doutes
insoluble / than they bind him to certain tradycions found by man / and
plainly thruste the wretched person heedlonge in to a certain bondage of

fear / but not to love. The order The order of monks.

This thing only I warn the of / that thou put pytie neither in meat nor in
raiment or habyte / nor in any visyble thing / but in those things which
have been declared and showed the before: and in what soever persons thou shalt
find or perceive ye true image of Christ / with the^ cople thyselfe. Moreover

This fellow must be had ever in thy bosom to be read and studied both night
and day: finally and to be learned without the book word by word / upon whom
we have now a good while enforced with great dilyge^ce to make a comment or a
enarracyon / a bold deed truly. But not withstanding we trusting in the
help of god / will endeuoyre our self besyly leest after Origene / Ambrose /
and Augustyne / leest after so many new interpretours we should seem to have
taken this labor upon us / utterly either without a cause or without fruit:
and also that certain besy and unquiet pyckquarelles / which thynken it
perfyte relygion to know nothing at all of good lernyng / may understand and
well perceive that where as we in youth have embrased and made much of the
pure learning of old auctours / and also have gotten / and that not without
great swette and watch / a mean understanding of both the tongues greek and
latin. Good lernyng profyteth unto pity.
we have not in so doing looked unto a vain and folysshe fame / or unto the
chyldysshe pastyme and pleasure of our mind / but that we were minded long
before to adorn and garnysshe the lords temple with the richesse of other
strange nacyons and countries to the vttermoste of our power. which temple
some men with their ignorance and barbarousnesse has ouermoche dishonested /
that by the reason of such richesse excellent wits might also be inflamed
unto the love of holy scripture.

But this so great a thing a few days laid a part / we have taken upon us
this labor for thy sake / that unto the (as it were with a finger) we might
show the way which ledeth straight unto Christ. And I beseech Jesus y^ father
of this holy purpose (as I hope) that he would vouchsafe benyngly to favor thy
wholesome enforcementes / ye that he would in chaungyng of the increase his grace
/ and make the perfyte / that thou myghtest quyckly wax bygge and strong in
him / and spring up unto a perfyte man. In whom also fare thou well brother
