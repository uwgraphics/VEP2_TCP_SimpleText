LILLIES RVLES construed, Whereunto are added THO. ROBERTSONS Heteroclites, the
Latin Syntaxis, and Qui mihi.

LONDON, Printed by Bonham Norton, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty, in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. 16^^.

TO THE READER.
I Long since (gentle Reader) following the example of diverse learned men, who
had labored much in this kind, construed, and being thereunto importuned by
many, published Lillies rules of the genders of Nounes, the preterperfect
tenses and supines of verbes: his Schoole-precepts, commonly called (Qui mihi)
Thomas Robersons Treatise of the Heteroclites, and the Latin Syntaxis. Which I
did, being upon long and sufficient experience well assured, that a good part
of the Masters daily pains, and the Scholars fruitless diligence, being
hereby removed, the one may, to the great content of his Parents and Master,
even by himself with better courage and greater profit, learn his lesson in
far shorter time, and keep it more faithfully in memory, than he did
before: and the other may cheerfully with more comfort and greater credit than
he was accustomed, teach more necessary things, as the declining of Nounes,
conjugating of Verbes, and the meaning of the Rules, with a manifold use of the
examples, choosing rather the practice than the teaching of the Art. If by this
easy mean, I any ways help or encourage thee, I shall be very glad: if not,
yet have I the hire and the glory I sought for, namely, that I have endeavored
to stand thee in stead the best that I could. Farewell.

Thine in the Lord, WILLIAM HAINE.

Propria quae maribus construed.
DIcas Thou mavest call propria proper names, quae which tribuuntur are
attributed maribus to the male kind mascula masculine: ut as ^unt be divorum
the names of the heathenish gods, Mars the god of battle, Bacchus the god of
wine, Apollo the god of wisdom: virorum of men, ut as Cato the name of a
wiseman in Rome, Virgilius Virgil: fluviorum of rivers, ut as Tybris the Tyber
in Italy, Orontes the Orontes by Antioch: mensium of months ut as October the
month so called: ventorum of winds, ut as Lybs the Southwest wind by west,
Notus the South wind, Auster the South wind.

PRopria nomina proper names referentia sh^wing foemineum sexum the female
kind tribuuntur are attributed foemineo generi to the feminine gender: sive
whether sunt they be dearum the names of heathenish goddesses, ut as Juno
Jupiters wife, Venus the goddess of beauty: mulierum of women, ceu as Anna
Anne, Philotis Philot: urbium of Cities, ut as Elis a City of Peloponnesus,
Opus a City in Locris: regionum of Countries, ut as Graecia Greece, Persis
Persia. Item also nomen the name Insulae of an I Will, ceu as Creta Creete:
Brittannia Britain, Cyprus Cypres. Tamen nevertheless quaedam some names
urbium of ^^ties sunt are excipienda to be excepted, ut as ista mascula these
masculines, Sulmo the town where Ovid was borne, Agragas a town in Scicilie.
quaedam neutralia some neuters, ut as Argos a City in Peloponnesus, Tybur a
city in Italy, Praeneste a city in Italy, and and Anxur a city in Italy,
quod which dat vtrumque genus is both masculine and neuter.

APpellativa common names arborum of trees crunt shall be muliebria feminine,
ut as alnus an alder tree, cupressus a cypress tree, cedrus a cedar tree,
spinus a sloe tree mas is masculine, o^easter a wild Olive tree, mas is
masculine, and and siler an osier, suber cork; thus frank incense, robur an
oak, qu^ and acer a maple, sunt are neutra neuters.

ETiam also volucrum he names of birds, ceu as passer a sparrow, hirundo
aswallow, ferarum of wild beasts, ut as tigris a tiger, vulpes a sex, and and
piscium of fishes, ut as Ostrea an oister, coetus a whale, sunt are dicta
called epicoena noun^s of the epicene gender, quibus to which vox ipsa the word
it self feret will give genus aptum bis right gender. Attamen Notwithstanding
ex cunctis among all the nounes quae Which diximus we spoke of ante before,
notandum we must note, omne that every noune quod which exit ends in um, seu
whether Graecum Greek, sieve or Latinum Latin, esse is genus neutrum the
neuter gender: sic so nomen a noune invariabile undeclined. Sed but nunc now
dicam I will entreat ordine in order de reliquis of the other nounes, quae
which vocantur are called appellativa common, aut or quae which sunt are
tanquam as appellativa common: nam for genus the gender semper dignoscitur is
alwai^s known his in these ex genitivo by the genitive case, ut as t^iplex
regula speciallis the three special rules monstrabit will show inf^a afterward.

NOmen a noune non crescens not increasing genitivo in the genitive case, est
is genus muliebre the ^eminine gender, ceu as caro carnis flesh, capra caprae a
she geate, nubes nubis a cloud.

MVlta nomina many names viro^um of men in a dicuntur are called mascula
masculine, ut as scriba a secretary, assecla a page, scurra a scoffer, and and
rabula a brawler, lixa a scullion, ^anista a master of defense; quot as many as
declinatio prima the first declension Graecorum of the Greeks fundit does make
to end in as and in es, and and quot as many Latin nounes as fiunt are derived
ab illis of them per a ending in a, mascula are masculine ut us satrapas
satrapa a Peer of the realm, athletes athleta a great wrestler. Item also
leguntur these are read mascula masculine, verres a bore pig, natalis ones
birth day aqualis an ewer, nata nounes derived ab ass of as a pound weight, ut
as centussis an hundred pound wright: conjunge join thou lienis the milt, and
and orbis any round thing, callis a path, caulis a stalk, follis a pair of
bellow^s, collis a little hill, mensis a month, and and ensis aswo^d, fustis a
club, funis a rope, panis bread, penis a man's yard, crinis hair, and and ignis
fire, cassis a hunters net, fascis a faggot, torris a firebrand, sentis a
thorn, piscis a fish, and and vnguis a man's nat^e, and and vermis a worm,
vectis a bar, postis a post, and and axis an axell tree societur may be
joined. In er nounes ending in er mascula are masculine, ceu as venture a
belly, in os vel or us, ut us logos a w^rd, annus a year.

SVnt these nounes be foeminei generis the seminine gend^r, matter a mother,
humus the ground, domus a house, alvus a paunch and and colus a distaffe, and
and ficus quartae of the sourth declension pro fructu for a fig, que and acus
a needle, porticus a porch, atque and tribus a stock, socrus a wives or
husbands mother, nurus the sons wif^, and and manus a hand, idus the ides of
a month, anus an old woman addenda est must be added huc hither: mystica
vannus the mystical fan Iacchi of Bacchus huc hither, jungas add his to
these Graeca Greeks nounes vertentia changing os in us os into us, papyrus
paper, antidotus a medicine to expel poison, costus the herb called herba
Marie, diphthongus a dipthong, byssus sine flax, abyssus a bottomless pit,
crystalius cristall, synodus an assembly, saphirus a sapphire stone, eremus a
wilderness, and and arctus a company of stars in the North called the
Bear, cum multis alijs with many other, quae which nunc at this time longum
est is long perscribere to set down.

SI is nomen a noune in e gignit make is in the genittue case, neutrum it is a
neuter, vt as ma^e the sea, rete a net: and and quot as many as fiunt do end
in on, vel or in um, ut as barbiton a kind of musical instrument, ovum an
egg, hippomanes a venomous humor coming from a mare est is genus neutrum the
neuter gender, and and cacoethes an ill custom neutrum is neuter, and and
virus poison, pelagus the sea, vulgus the common people modo sometimes neutrum
is neuter, modo sometimes mas masculine.

SVnt these nounes are incerti generis the doubtful gender, talpa a mole, and
and dama a bucke or a do, canalis a channel or a conduit pipe, halcyonis a
kingfisher, finis an end, clunis a buttocke, restis an balter, penus all
victuals meat and drink, amnis ariuer, pampinus a vine leaf, and and corbis a
ba^ket; linter a cockboat, torquis a collar, specus a den, anguis a ^ack^,
ficus dans fici of the second declension pro morbo for a disease, atque and
phaselus a ship called a gallion, lecithus an ^y^e glass, ae and atomus a
mote in the Sun, grossus a green fig, pharus an high witch-t^wer, and and
paradisus a paradise.

COmpositum a verbo a noune made of a verb dans a ending in a est is commune
the common duorum of two, Graiugena a Groecian borne, a of gigno to get
monstrat shows id that, agricola a husbandman a of colo to till, advena a
stranger a of venio to come: add add senex an old man or woman, auriga a
carter, and and verna a bondsman or woman, sodalis a companion, vates a prophet:
extorris a ban^shed man or woman, patruelis my fathers brothers child, que and
perduellis a stubborn enemy affinis a kinsman or kinswoman by marriage,
juvenis a young man or woman, testis a witness, civis acitizen, canis a dog
or a bitch, hostis an enemy.

NOmen a noune est is muliebre genus the seminine gender, si if penultima
syllaba the syllable last save one genetivi of the genetiue case crescentis
increasing sonet sound acuta long, velut as haec pietas pietatis godliness,
virtus virtutis virtue monstrant doshew.

QVaedam nomina some ^ounes monosyllaba of one syllable dicuntur are called
mascula mascusine, sal salt, sol the sun, ren the kidney or the reins of the
back, and and splen the spleen, Car a man of Caria, Ser a man of Asia, vir a
man, vas vadis a surety, as a pound weight, mas the male kind, bes the weight
of eight ounces, Cres one of Creta, pres a surety, and and pes a soote, glis a
dormouse, habens having gliris genetivo in the genetiue case, mos a manner,
flos a flower, ros the deaw, and and Tios a man of Troy, mus a mouse* dens a
tooth, mons a mountain, pons a bridge, simul and and also fons a spring, seps
pro serpente a serpent, gryps a griffia, Thrax a Thrac^an, rex a king, grex
gregis a slo^ke of Cattle, and and Phryx a man of Phrygia. Etiam also
polysyllaba nounes of many ^yllables in n, sunt are mascula masculines, ut as
Acarnan a hill by Athens, lichen the herb buer wort, and and delphin a
dolphin, and in o and which and in o signantia signifying corpus a body, ut as
Leo a Lion, Curculio a Weasell, sic so senio the sise point, ternio the trey
point sermo a word or speech. In er, or and os, nounes ending in er or and os
mascula are masculine, ceu as crater a standing piece or cup, conditor a
builder, heroes a noble man, sic so torrens a brook^, nefrens a young pig, ^riens
the East, cum pluribus with many in dens, quale such as is bidens, quando when
reperitur, pro instrumento it signifies a dung-forke, add add gigas a giant,
elephas an elephant, adamas a diamond, que and Garamas an inhabitant of
Afric, tapes tapestrie, atque and lebes a cauldron, Cures a Towns name,
magnes a stone that draws iron unto it, que and vnum nomen one noune quintae
of the fifth declension meridies noone or the midday. Et also quae nounes which
componuntur are compounded ab ass of as a pound weight, ut as dodrans nine
ounces, semis half a pound, jungantur mascula let these masculines be added,
Samnis a Samnite, hydrops the dropsy, nycticorax a night raven, thorax the
breast, and and mascula these masculines, vervex a belweather, phoenix a phoenix,
and and bombyx pro vermiculo a silk worm. Attamen yet ex his of these, siren
a mermaid, mulier a woman, soror a sister, vxor a wife, sunt are muliebre genus
the feminine gender.

ET also haec nomina these nounes monosyllaba of one syllable sunt are
neutralia neuters, mel honey, fell gall, lac milk, far bread corn, ver the
spring time, cor a heart, aes brass, vas vasis a vessel, os ossis a bone, and
and os oris a mouth, rus the country, thus frankincense, jus right, crus the
leg from the knee to the ancle, pus snot. Et and polysyllaba of many sillables,
in all que and in ar, ut as capital a ribon or coife, laquear a vauted roof of
a chamber: halec a berring. neutrum is the neuter gender and and muliebre the
feminine.

HAec these nounes sunt are dubia the doubtful gender, python a prophesying
spirit, scrobs a dit^h, serpens a serpent, bubo an owl, rudens a cable rope,
grus a crane, perdix a partridge, lynx a spotted beast, limax, a snaile, stirps
pro trunco a stumpe of a tree, and and calx pedis the heel, add add thou
dies a day, tantum only esto let it be mas masculine secundo numero in the
plural number.

SVnt these are commune the common of two, parens a father or mother, que and
author a beginner, infans an infant, adolescens, a youth, dux a captain, illex
a lawless body, haeres an heir, exlex a lawless body, creata the compounds
a of front a forehead, ut as bi^rons one which has a double forehead, custos
a keeper, bos an ox, bull, or cow, fur a thief, sus a sow, atque and sacerdos
a priest or nun.

SI if penultima the last syllable save one genetivi of the genitive case
crescentis increasing sit be gravis short, ut as sanguis blood genetivo in the
genitive case sanguinis, nomen that noune est is mas a masculine.

SIt hyperdyssyllabon let a noune of more than two sillables be foeminei
generis the feminine gender in do, quod which makes dinis, atque and in go,
quod which dat gives ginis in genitivo in the genetiue case, dulcedo
sweetness fac^ens making dulcedinis monstrat id tibi does show that, que and
compago a joint compaginis id that: Adjice add to these virgo a maid, grando
hail fides faith, compes a pair of fetters, teges a matte, and and se. ges
standing corn, arbor a tree, que and hyems winter: sic so bacchar the herb
Lady gloves, sindon fine linen cloth, Gorgon a certain terrible woman, Icon
an Image, and and Amazon a Woman of Schythia. Graecula Gre^ke nounes finita
ending in as vel or in is, ut as lampas a lamp, iaspis a Jasper stone, cassis
an helmet, cuspis a point of spear: vox una one word in us pecus cattle dans
making pecudis in the genetiue case. Add add thou his to these, for fex a
pair of sheares, pellex an harlot to a wedded man, carex sedge, simul at que
and also supellex household stuff, appendix a p^int-house, hiftrix a porcupike,
coxendix an hippe, que and filix fearne.

NOmen a noune in a signas signifying rem a thing non animatam without life est
is neutrale genus the neuter gender, ut as problema a hard question: en, ut as
omen forespeaking; ar, ut as jubar the sunne-beame; dans ending in ur, ut as
jecur the liver; us, ut as onus a burden; put, ut as occiput the hin der part
of the head. Attamen yet ex his of these pecten a comb, fur fur bran, sunt
mascula are masculine. Sunt these are neutra neuters, cadauer a dead carcass,
verber a stripe, iter a journey, suber cork, tuber pro fungo a ^oad stool,
and and uber a dugge gingiber ginger, and and laser the herb Benjamin, cicer
an Italian pease, and and piper pepper, at que and papaver poppie. and and
siler a parsenip, atque and siler anosier, Aequor the Sea, marmor marble, que
and ador wheat, neutra are neuters, atque and pecus cattle, quando when facit
it makes pecoris in genetivo in the genetiue cafe.

SVnt these are dubij generis the doubtful gender, cardo the hinge of a door,
margo the brim of any thing, cinis ashes, obex a bolt of a door, pulvis dust,
adeps fatness, forceps a pair of tongs, pumex a pumice stone, ramex
burstennes anas a ducke or a drake, imbrex a gutter tile: add add culex a
gnatte, natrix a water serpent, and and onyx the nail of a man's hand, cum
prole with his compound, que and silex a flint, quamuis although usus use vult
will melius rather he that these nounes dicier be called mascula masculines.

ISta these nounes sunt are communis generis the common of two genders, vigil a
watchman or watchwoman, pugil a champion, exul a banished man or woman, praesul
a president, homo a man or woman, nemo no body, martyr a martyr, Lygur one of
Lyguria, Augur a soothsayer, and and Arcas one of Arcadia, antistes chief
among others, miles a soldier, pedes a footman, interpres an interpreter,
comes a companion, hospes an host or an hostess; sic so ales any great bird,
praeses a chief ruler, princeps a prince, auceps a fowler, eques a horseman,
obses a pledge in war, atque and multa alia nomina many other nounes quae
which creantur are derived a verbis of verbes, ut as conjux a husband or wife,
judex a judge, vindex a revenger, opifex a workman, and and aruspex a
soothsayer.

ADjectiva adjectives habentia having unam vocem one termination duntaxat only,
ut as foelix happy, audax bol^, retinent keep omne genus every gender sub una
in one ending: Si if cadant they fall sub gemina voce in a double termination,
velut as omnis and omne all, vox prior the former word est is commune the
commen duum of two, vox altera the second, neutrum the neuter. At but si if
variant they vary tres voces three endings, ut as sacer sacra sacrum holy, vox
prima the first word est is mas masculine, altera the second foeminea feminine,
tertia the third neutrum neuter. At but sunt there are nounes quae which
vocares you may call prope in a manner substantiva subslantiues flexu by
declining, tamen notwithstanding reperta they are found adjectiva adjectives
natura by nature que and usu by use: Talia such sunt are pauper poor, puber
ripe of age, cum with degener waxing out of kind, uber plentiful, and and
dives rich, locuples wealthy, sofpes safe, comes a companion, atque and
supe^stes one that ouerliueth, cum paucis alijs with a few others, quae which
lectio justa diligent reading docebit will teach. Haec these nounes gaudent
asciscere sibi will have proprium quendam flexum a certain proper declining:
Campester of the plain field, volucer fwift, celeber famous, celer swift,
atque and saluber wholesome. Iunge add pedester belonging to a footeman,
equester belonging to a horseman, and and acer sharp. Iunge add paluster
belonging to a marsh, ac and alacer cheerful, sylvester belonging to the
wood: at but sic thus tu variabis thou shall decline haec these nounes, hic
celer in the masculine gender, haec celeris in the feminine, neutro in the
neuter hoc celere, aut or aliter otherwise sic thus, hic atque haec celeris in
the masculine and feminine, rursum again hoc celere est tibi neurrum is the
neuter gender.

Quae genus construed.
De nominibus Heteroclitis Thomae Robersoni.
SVnto let these nounes be Heteroclita Heteroclites quae which variant do
vary genus gender aut or flexum declension, quaecunque and whatsoever
deficiunt do want, superantve or have ^uermuch, no^ato ritu after a new order.
Cernis thou see haec these variantia changing genus gender ac and partim
partly flexum declension, Pergamus infoelix urbs the unhappy City Troum of
the Trojans gignit makes Pergama: Quod which thing ipsa the word it self
supellex household stuff facit does nisi except careat it want plurali the
plural number. Singula these being singulars gaude^t foemine^s are feminines.
Pluralia being plurals neutris neuters. Prior numerus the singular number dat
gives his to these nounes genus neutru^ the neuter gender, alter the plural
vtrumque both masculine and neuter: Rastrum a rake, cum with fraeno a bridle
filum thread simul atque and also capistrum an headstall, item also Argos a
town in Greece, and and coelum heaven, singula being singulars su^t are neutra
neuters: sed but audi mark vocitabis thou shall call coelos and Argos in the
plural number duntaxat only mascula masculine* sed but fraena neuter and and
fraenos masculine, quo pacto after which sort and also formant they form
caetera the rest: Nundinum a fair and hinc and also epulum a banquet, quibus
unto which addito add thou balneum a bath, and and haec these sunt are neutra
neuters, quidem indeed primo in the plural number, rite by custom muliebria
f^minines secundo in the plural. Constat it is certain Iuuenalem habere that
Iuuenal has balnea baths plural in the plural number.

HAec these nounes singularia being singidars, dantur maribus are masculines,
plurima being plurals neutris neuters, Maenalus an hill in Arcadia, atque and
sacermons the sacred mountain Dyndimus a top of Ida by Tr^y, Isma^us a
mountain in Thracia. atque and Tartara hell Tayg^tus an hill in Laced^monia,,
sic so Tenera a Promontorie in L^conia, Massica a Mountain in Campania, and
and altus gargarus the high top of the hill Ida. At but alter numerus the
plural number dabit will give his to these nounes vtrumque genus both genders,
sibilus an hissing atque and ^ocus sport, locus a place, and and Campanus
auernus a lake of Campanla in Itali^.

Propago the remnant quae which sequitur follows est is manca maimed numero
in number casuve or in case.

Vocabis thou shall call those nounes Aptota, quae which variat alter nullu^
casu^ no case, ut as fas right, nil nothing, nihil nothing, instar like, and
and multa many in u simul i, in u and i, ut as haec these sunt be que both
cornu a horn, que and genu a knee, sic so gu^mi gum frugi thrifty, sic so
te^pe a very fair field in Thessalia, tot so many, quot how many and and omnes
numeros all nounes of number, ^ tribus from three ad centum to an hundred.

QVe and nome^ a noune est is monoptoto^, cui to which vox una one word cadit
happens ceu as noctu by night, natu by birth, jussu by bidding, injussu
without bidding simul also ast^^ by craft promptu with speed, permissu by
suffera^ce, legimus we read a stus plurali in the plural number, legimus we
read inficias a denial, sed but vox ea that word est is sola only reperta
found.

SVnt these be diptota quibus to which duplex flexura a double declining
remansit remains, ut as fors hap dabit will give forte sexto in the ablative
case, queque also spontis of his own accord sponte: Sic so plus more habet
has pluris, repetundaru^ of br^bery repetundis, and and jugeris of an acre dat
gives jugere sexto in the ablative case: autem but verberis of a stripe
verbere, quoque also suppetiae aid dant makes suppetias quarto in the
accusative case, tantundem as much dat gives tatidem, simul also impetis of
violence dat gives hoc impete: Iunge add vicem by turn sexto in the ablative
case vice; nec neither lego do I read plura more: haec quatuor these four
verberis of a stripe, at que and vicem by turn, sic so plus more cum with
jugere an acre tenuere have kept cunctos casus all their cases numero secundo
in the plural number.

VOcantur they are called triptota, quibus wherein inflectis thou deest decline
tres casus three cases, ut as precis prayer, atque and precem, and and blandus
a kind man petit amicam wo^s his love prece by entreatie; sic in like manner
legis thou read opis est nostrae it is in our power, fer opem help thou at
que and dignus open worthy of help. At but frugis of fruit tantum only caret
wants recto the nominative case, and also ditionis of title: vis force est is
vox integra a perfect word, nisi except forte* perhaps dativus the dative case
desit be wanting prior numerus the singular number mutilus is vnpsrfect
omnibus his in all these, alter the plural integer is whole. Quae referunt
relatiues: ut as qui which, quae perco^tantur interrogatiues ut as ecquis who:
and and quae distribuunt distributiues, ut as nullus none, neuter neither of
two, and and omnis all: infinita nounes indefinites solent are wont iungi to be
joined his to these, ut as quilibet every one, alter another: Haec these saepe
often carent do want quinto casu the vocative case. Et and pronomina the
pronounes praeter except haec quatuor these four, infra following, noster ours
nostras of our country, meus mine and and tu thou. Notes you may observe
propria cuncta all proper names quibus est which have natura coercens a
restraining nature, ne fuerint that they shall not be plurima plurals, ut as
Mars the heathenish God of battle, Cato the name of a wise man in Rome, Gallia
France, Roma Rome, Ida an hill by Troy. Tagus a river in Portugal, Lelaps a
dogs name, Parnassus an hill in Phocis, que and Bucephalus the horse of
Alexander the great. Dabis thou shall add his to these frumenta bread-corne,
pensa Tow or Wool on a distaffe, herbas hearbe^, uda moist things, metalla
metals in quibus in which ipse requiras thou may search quae what sint are
placita the pleasures authorum of authors, Est there is a time vbi when haec
these retinent keep pluralem the plural number, est there is a time also vbi
when spernunt they have it not.

HOrdea barley, farra breadcorne, forum a market, mel honey, mulsum wine
mingled with honey, defruta wine sodden till the third part be boiled away.
que and thus frankincense, pluralia being plurals servant they keep tantum
only tres similes voces three like cases. Hesperus the evening star, et and
vesper the evening, pontus the sea, que and limus mud, que and fimus dung, sic
so penus all victuals meat and drink, and and sanguis blood sic so ether the
sky, nemo no body: sed but Ista mascula these masculines vix sunt excedentia
scarcely exceed numerum primum the singular number.

SIngula these singulars foeminei generis of the feminine gender, raro seldom
pluralia are plurals, pubes ripeness of age, atquc and salus health, sic so
talio like for like, cum with indole towardness, tussis the cough, pix pitch,
humus the ground atque and lues a murren, sitis thirst, and and fuga a flying
away, iunge add quietem rest, sic so cholera choler, atque and fames hunger:
que and bilis melancholy, senecta old age* juventus youth Sed but tamen yet
haec these nounes soboles an of spring, labes a spot, vt as and also omnia all
quintae of the fifidcclension saepe often tenebunt will keep plurali in the
plural number tres similes casus, three like cases, excipe except res a thing,
species a kind, facies a face, que and acies an edge que and dies a day, quas
voces which words licet may esse be totas whole secundo numero in the plural
number. Solent they are wont nectere to add istis to these multa muliebria
many feminines: ut as haec these sunt are stultitia foolishness, invidia
envy, and and sapientia wisdom, desidia sloth, at que and innumerae voces
innumerable words id genus of this sort, quas which lectio reading praebet
yields quam prefixam tibi which set before thee collige gather together ceu
as certum filum a sure guiding thread. Add put rarius very seldom secundum
numerum the plural number his to these nounes, sed but yet quandoque sometimes.

NEc neither licet may we defer give secundum numerum the plural number his
neutris to these neuters: Delicium the thing wherein we delight, senium old
age, lethum death, que and coenum dirt, que and salum the Sea: Sic so barathrum
a place taken for hell, virus poison vitrum glass, que and viscum birdlime,
que and penum provision of victuals, iustitium vacation or out of Term,
nihilum nothing, ver the spring, lac milk, gluten glue: simul also halec an
herring, add add gelu a frost, solium a seat of state or throne, iubar a sun
beam: hic here quoque also ponas thou may put multa talia many such, quae
which si if observes thou obseruest, occurrent will come tibi legenti to thee
as thou read.

MAscula these masculines sunt are contenta contented tantum only numero
secundo with the plural number, manes spirits, maiores ancestors, cancelli
latices, Liberi children and and antes the uttermost ranks of vines, menses
profluvium women's monthly flowers, lemures hobgoblins fasti a register for
things of the year, atque and minores posterity, cum when natales assignant
signify genus a stock, add add Penates the heathnish household gods, and and
loca places, plurali in the plural number quales such as be que both Gabij a
city in Italic que and Locri people of Locris, and and quaecunque whatsoever
legas thou read passim in any place similis rationis of the like sort.

HAec these noune^ sunt are foemineigeneris the feminine gender que and numeri
secu^di the plural number: exuviae things which are put off, phalerae horse
trapping, que and grates thanks, manubiae spoils taken in war, and and idus
the Ides of a month, antiae forelockes and and induciae a truce, simul also,
que both insidiae a lying in wait, que and minae threatenings excubiae watch
and ward, nonae the nones of a month, nugae trifles, que and tricae trifling
gewgawes, calendae the calends, quisquiliae the sweepings and refuse of things,
thermae baths, cunae the cradies of Infants, dirae cursings, quae and exequiae
solemnities at burials, inferiae heathenish sacrifices done to spirits and and
feriae holy days, sic so que both primitiae the first fruits, que and plagae
signantes signifying retia nets and and valuae folding doors, que and diviriae
riches, nuptiae marriage, item and and also lactes the small guts, addantur let
there be added Thaebae the City of Thebes, and and Athenae Athens quod genus
of which sort inuenias thou may find and also plura nomina more names locorum
of places.

HAec neutra these neuters legu^tur are read plurali, in the plural number,
rarius very seldom primo in the singular: moenia the walls of a City, cum
with tesquis rough places, praecordia the midrisfe, lustra the dens ferarum
of wild beasts, arma weapons, mapalia cottages sic so bellaria iuncats, munia
a duty, castra a ^^mpe or tent, fu^^s a funeral petit requires iusta
ceremonies, and and virgo a maid petit requires sponsalia betrotbings,
disertus an eloquent man amat loves rostra a pulpit, que and pueri children
gestant carry crepundia rattels to play withal, que and infantes infants
colunt love cunabula cradles, augur the southsayer consulit asks counsel of
extra the entrals, and and absolvens finishing recantat muttereth effata
prayers superis to the imagined gods: festa the feasts deum of the heathenish
gods, ceu as Bacchanalia feasts dedicated to Baschus, poterunt may iungi be
joined: quod si if then leges thou shall read plura more licet reponas thou
may put them quoque also hac class in this rule.

HAec these nounes imitantia imitating varias formas diverse forms quasi
luxuriant do as it were exceed, nam for tonitrus tonitruque thunder variant
do vary and both genus their gender and and vocem their termination, sic so
clypeus clypeum a buckler baculus baculum atque bacillum a staff, sensus a
sense, and hoc sensum the conceit of the mind, tignus tignumque a rafter:
tapetu^ atque tapete tapes tapestry punctus punctumque a point, sinapi
mustard seed quod which immutans changing genus his gender, fertur is called
scelerata sinapis biting mustard, sinus and hoc sinum vas lactis a milke-boule
or milking-paile, mendaque mendum a fault, viscus and hoc viscum birdlime* Sic
so cornu an horn, and and flexile cornum the bending horn: at but Lucanus
Lucan ait says tibi cura have a care cornus sinistri of the left wing of the
army: eventus simul also eventum an event: Sed but quid moror why stay I istis
in these? lectio the reading doctorum of learned authors ministrat affoordeth
tibi unto thee talia millc a thousand such.

SEd but praeterea further quaedam* Graeca some Greek nounes sunt tibi notanda
are to be noted of thee, quae which peperere have brought forth foetum Latinum
a new Latin word, quarto casu from the accusative case: nam for panther a
panther creat makes panthera in the accusative case, que and crater a standing
piece cratera, cassis an helmet habet has cassida: sed but and also ether the
sky fundit makes aethera; hinc hence venit comes cratera a standing piece,
aethera the sky venit comes, sic euenso cassida magna a great helmet tegit
covers caput ipsum the h^ad, nec neither vult will panthera the panther
domari be tamed.

REctus the naminatiue case vertitur is varied his in these, sensus the
signification manet remains and and v^um genus one gender: gibbus and hic
gibber, a b^nch in ones back, cucumis cucumer a cucumber, stipis and stips
wages, sic so cinis atque ciner ashes, vomis vomer a plow share, scobis and
scobs saw dust or pin dust, item also pulvis pulver dust, pubes puber ripeness
of age. Quibus to which adds thou shall add quae nonnes which pariunt bring
forth or and os honor honor, and and labor labor, arbor a tree, que and odor
scent or savor, Et also his thou shall add to these apes and apis a Be,
plebs plebis the common people, quoqu^ also sunt there are multa many accepta
received a Graecis from the Gre^kes referentia expressing geminam formam a
double for me: ut as delphin delphinus a Dolphin, and and hic elephase
lephantus an elephant* sic so congrus co^ger a conger, sic so Meleagrus
Meleager a man's name item also Tencrus Teucer a King of Troy: and also dabis
thou shall add huc hither caetera cuncta all other quae which par ratio the
like reason, and and lectio cas^a diligent reading dederint shall giv^ tibi
unto thee.

HAec these simul together sunt are and both quarti flexus the fourth
declension atque and secundi the second; enim for laurus a laurel tree facit
makes genetivo in the genetiue case lauii and laurus, sic so quercus an ^ake,
pinus a pine, ficus pro fructu for a fig, ac and arbo^e a figtree, sic so
colus a distasse atque and penus provision of victuals, cornus quando when
a^bor habetur it is taken for a cornell tree: sic so lacus a lake, atque and
domus an house, licet although haec this ne^ recurrat be not to be found vbique
in every case: quoque also leges thou shall read plura more his then these:
quae which jure by right relinquas thou may leave priscis to old authors.

ET and sunt there are multa adiectiua many adjectives quae which luxu^iant
abound notanda to be noted, sed but in primis first of all quot as many as and
also haec nomina these nounes tibi fundunt do bring forth: arma weapons, jugum
a ^oake, nervus a sinew, somnus sleep, que and clivus the steep side of an
hill; que and animus a mind, and and quot as many as limus mud habet has quot
as many as, froenum a bridle. and and cera wax, bacillum a s^asse, a quibus of
which forms thou may form us simul is both us and is, ut as inermus
inermis vnw^aponed: ast but hilatus merry, rarior is very rare, hilaris est
is vox a word been not a well known.

As in praesenti construed.
AS the termination as in praesenti in the present tense format forms
perfectum the preterperfect tense in avi^ut as no ^as to swim navi, vocito
vocitas to call often vocitavi: deem except lavo to wash lavi, juvo to help
juvi que and nexo to knit nexui, and and seco to cut quod which makes secui,
neco to kill, quod which makes necui: verbum the verb mico to shine quod
which makes micui, plico to fold, quod which makes plicui, fric^ to rub quod
which dat gives fricui, sic so domo to make tame quod which makes domui, tono
to thunder quod which makes tonui, verbum the verb sono to sound quod which
makes sonui, crepo to give a crack quod which makes crcpui, veto to forbid
quod which dat gives vetui; atque and cubo to lie down cubui haec these
verbes raro formantur are seldom formed in avi. Do das to giuc rite by right
dedi: sto stas to stand vult will formare form steti.

ES the termination es in praesenti in the present tense format forms
perfectum the preterperfect tense dans giving ui, vt as nigreo nigres to wax
black nigrui excipe except iubeo to command iussi, sorbeo to sup any liquid
thing habet has s^rbui quoque also sorpsi mulceo to assuage mulsi, luceo to
shine vult will have luxi, sedeo to sit sedi, que and video to see vult will
have vidi; sed but pra^deo to dine prandi, strideo to make a noise stridi,
Syllaba prima the first Syllable geminatur is doubled his quatuor in these
four infra following, namque for pendeo to hang pependi, que and mordeo to
bite vult will habere have momordi, spondeo to promise freely or betroth
spospondi, que and tond ^o to clip or sheere vult will have totondi: suadeo to
counsel suasi: rideo to laugh risi and and ardeo to burn habet has arsi. Si
if l vel r, l or r stet stand ante before geo, geo vertitur is turned in si
into siut as urgeo to urge ursi, mulgeo to milk mulsi dat it giucth quoque
also mulxi, frigeo to be celd frixi, lugeo to lament luxi and and augeo to
increase habet has auxi, fleo fles to weep dat gives fleui, leo les to
anoint levi, que and natum the compound inde there of deleo to put out delevi,
pleo ples to fill plevi, neo to spin nevi Mansi formatur is formed a of maneo
to tarry, torqueo to wrest torsi, haereo to stick fast vult will have haesi,
veo fit is made vi, ut as ferveo to be hot fervi, niveo to wink or be^ken and
and satum the compound inde thereof conniveo to wink with the eyes poscit
requires nivi and nixi, cieo to trouble civi: que and vieo to bind vievi.

TErtia the third conjugation formabit will form praeteritum the preterperfect
tense ut as manifestu^ is manifest hic here. Bo fit is made by, ut as lambo to
lick^ lambi,: excipe except scribo to write scripsr, and and nubo to he married
nupsi, antiquum the old verb cumbo to lie down dat gives cubui. Co fit is
made ci, ut as vinco to overcome vici, parco to spare vult will have peperci
and parsi, dico to soy dixi, quoque also duco to lead duxi, Do fit is made di,
ut as mado to eat mandi: sed but seindo to cut dat gives scidi findo to cleave

shave, laedo to hurt, ludo to play, divido to divide, trudo to thrust, claudo
to shut, plaudo to clap hands for joy, rodo to gnaw ex of do the termination
semper always faciunt make si. Go fit is made xi, ut as iungo to join iunxi:
sed but r the letter ante before go, vult will have si, ut as spargo to
sprinkle sparsi, lego to read legi and and ago to doc facit makes egi, tango
to touch dat gives tetigi, pu^go to prick punxi que and pupugi frango to
break dat gives fregi, cum when pango signat signifies pacisci to* make a
covenant vult it will have pepigi, pro iungo to join pegi pro cano to sing
pa^xi. Ho fit is made xi, ceu as traho to draw traxi docet teaches and and
veho to caric vevi. Lo fit is made uiceu as colo to worship colui excipe except
psallo to sing cu^ p with p, and and sallo to seaso^with salt sine p without p:
nam for vtrumque both format form salli, vello to pluoke up dat gives velli
quoque also vuisi, fallo to deoeiue fefelli, cello pro frango to break^ seculi
que and pello to drive out pepuli. Mo fit is made ui, ceu as vomo to vomit
vomui, sed but emo to buy facit makes emi como to kembe petit requires
compsi, promo to draw out prompsi, adijce add thou demo to take away quod
which format forms de^psi, sumo to take sumpsi, premo to press pressi No fit
is made vi, ceu as sino to suffer sivi: excipe except temno to contemn tempsi:
sterno to straw dat gives stravi, sperno to despise sprevi, lino to smeare

Po fit is made psi: ut as seaspo to scratch scalpsi: excipe except rumpo to

melius better serui, verro to brush vult will have verri and versi, uro to
burn ussi gero to bear gessi, quaero to seek quaesiui, tero to wear trivi,
curro to run cucurri. So formabit w^ll form sivi, velut as accerso to go to
call arcesso the same, lacesso to revile, atque and incesso to proucke one in
speech. Sed but toll except capesso to take capessi quodque which also facit
makes capessivi atque and facesso to go above to do facessi sic so viso to go
to see visi, sed but pinso to bake habebit w^ll have pinsui, Sco fit is made
vi, ut as pasco to feed pavi, posco to require vult w^ll have poposci disco to
learn vult will sormare form didici, quinisco to nod with the head quexi To
fit is made ti, ut as verto to turn verti, sed but notetur activu^ sisto let
this verb active sisto be marked pro facio stare to make to stand, nam for
dat it gives jure by right stiti, sterto to snort habet has stertui, meto to
mow messui. Ab of ecto fit is made exi, vt as flecto to bend flexi, pecto to
kembe dat gives pexui habetque and it has pexi, etiam also necto to knit dat

to ask petij sieve or petivi Vo fit is made vi ut as voluo to roll volvi,
excipe except vivo to live vixi Vt as nexo to knit habet has nexui, sic se

to be wise sapui at que and sapivi. Rio fit is made ri, ut as pario to bring
forth young peperi. Tio ssi geminas doubling ^. ut as quatio to shake quassi
quod the which vix scarcely reperitur is found in usu in use Denique lastly, uo
fit is made ui, ut as statuo to appoint statui, pluo to rain format forms
pluvi sive or plui, sed but struo to build struxi, fluo to flow fluxi.

QVarta the fourth conjugation dat gives is, in the second person, ivi, in the
preterperfect tense scio scis to know monstrat tibi sh^weth scivi: excipias
except venio to come dans giving veni, cambio to exchange campsi, raucio to be
hoarse rauci, farsio to stuff farsi, sarcio to patch sarsi, sepio to hedge
sepo, sensio eo perceive sensi, fulcio to underprop fulsi, item also haurio to
draw hausi, sancio to establish sanxi vincio to bind vinxi, salio pro salto to
leap salui, and and amicio to cloth dat gives amicui: utemur we shall use
parcius seldom cambivi I have exchanged, haurivi I have drawn, amicivi I have
clothed, sepivi I have hedged, sanxivi I have established, sarsivi I have
patched, atque and salivi I have leaped.

SImplex the simple verb and and compositivum the compound dat gives idem
praeteritum the same preterperfect tense, ut as docui I have taught, edocui I
have taught perfectly, mon strat shows: Sed but syllaba the syllable, qua^
which simplex the simple Verb semper geminat does always double non geminatur
is not doubled composto in the compound praeterqua^ except his tribus in these
three, praecurro to run before, excurro to run out, repungo to prick
again, atque and rite creatis in verbes rightly compounded a of do to give,
disco to learn, sto to stand posco to require. Compositum the compound a of
plico to fold cum sub with this preposition sub vel or nomine a noune ut as
ista these, supplico to beseech, multiplico to multiply gaudet reicyceth
formare to fo^me p^^cavi, applico to apply, complico to fold up, replico to
unfold: and and explico to declare ui vel in avi do make ui or avi. Quamuis
although simplex the simple Verb oleo to savor or smell vult will have olui,
tamen nevertheless quodvis compositum every compound inde thereof formabit will
form melius rather olevi; at but redolet to cast a strong smell sequitur does
follow formam the form simplicis of the simple Verb, que and subolet to smell
a little. Omnia composita all the compounds a of pungo to pri^ke, formabunt
will form punxi, vnum one repungo to prick again vult will have pupugi
interdumque and sometimes repunxi. Natum the compound a of do to give quando
when est it is inflexio tertia the third conjugation, ut as addo to add, credo
to believe, edo to set forth, dedo to yield, reddo to restore, perdo to lose,
abdo to hide, vel or obdo to thrust against, co^do to build indo to put in,
trado to deliver, prodo to betray, vendo to sell, didi: at but unum one
abscondo to hide abscondi. Natum the compound a of sto stas to stand habebit
will have stiti.

SI if Vexba haec simplicia these simple verbes componantur be compounded,
mutant they change vocalem primam the first vowell praesentis* of the present
tense praeteritique and of the preterperfect, tense in e into e, damno to
condemn, lacto to give suck, sacro to dedicate. fallo to deceive ar^eo to
drive away, tracto to handle, fatiscor to be weary, partio to divide, carpo to
croppe, patro to commit, scando to climb: spargo to sprinkle, que and pario to
bring forth young, cuius whose duo nata two compounds co^perit to know for
certain, and and reperit to find by adventure, dant give peri, sed but caetera
the rest perui, velut as haec these aperire to open, operire to cover. A of
pasco to feed pavi, notentur haec duo composta let these two compounds be
marked, habere to have pescui tantum only, compesco to pasture together,
dispesco to drive beasts from pasture: caetera the rest, ut as epasco to eat
up, seruabunt will keep usum the use simplicis of the simple Verb.

HAec these, habeo to have, lateo to lie hid, salio to leap, statuo to
appoint, cado to fall, laedo to hurt, pango to join, dans making pegi, cano to
sing, quaero to seek, caedo cecidi to beat, tango to touch, egeo to want or
stand in need, teneo to hold, taceo to hold ones peace, sapio to be wise, que
and rapio to snatch, si if componantur they be compounded, mutant they change
vocalem primam the first vowell in i into i, ut as rapio to snatch, rapuieripio
to take away by force eripui. Natum a compound a of cano to sing dat gives
praeteritum the preterpersect tense per ui by ui, ceu as concino to sing
together in one tune dat gives concinui, sic even so displicio to displease a
of placeo to please: sed but haec duo th^se two complaceo to please well cum
with perplaceo to please very much been servant do k^epe well usum the use
simplicis of the simple verb Ista quatuor composita these four compounds a of
pango to join retinent a keep a, depango to plant, oppango to ^^yne,
circumpango to fast^n about, at que and ^epango to set. Ista quatuor these
four compounds a of manco mansi to tarry dant give minui, praemineo to excel
others, emineo to appear before others, cum with promineo to hang out in
fight, que and immineo to hang over: at but caetera the rest seruabunt will
keep formam the form simplicis ve^bi of the simple verb. Composita the
compounds a of scalpo to scratch, calco to tread upon, salto to leap or dance,
mutant do change a per u a into u, exculpo to carue or engraue, inculeo often
to repeat, resulto to rebound, demonstrant show id that tibi to thee.
Composita the compounds a of claudo to shut, quatio to shake, lavo to wash,
reijciunt a cast away a, a of claudo to shut, docet shows id that, occludo to
shut fast, excludo to shut out, que and a of quatio to shake, percutio to
smite, excutio to smite out, nata the compounds a of lavo to wash, proluo all
to wash, diluo to purge with washing.

SI if componas thou do compound haec these verbes ago to do, emo to buy,
sedeo to sit, rego to rule frango to break, and and capio to take, iacio to
cast, lacio to allure or entice, specio to behold, premo to press, semper
always sibi mutant they change vocalem primam the first vowell praesentis os
the present tense in i, into i, nunquam never praeteriti of the praeterperfect
tense, ceu as frango to break, refringo to break open refregi Incipio to
begin incepi a of capio to take. Sed but pauca notentur let a few be marked,
namque for perago to finish sequitur does follow suum simplex his simple, que
and also satago to be busy or to do with speed: atque and ab of ago to do
dego to live, dat gives degi, cogo to comp^ll coegi. Sic, even so a of rego to
rule, pergo to go forward perrexi, quo que also surgo to arise vult will have
sur* rexi, media syllaba the middle syllable praesentis of the present tense
adempta being taken away. Facio to do variat does change nil nothing nisi
unless praeposito praeunte when a preposition goes before, olfacio to smell
out docet teaches id that, cum with calfacio to make hot, que and inficio to
infect Nata the compound a of lego to read, re, se, per, prae, sub, trans,
praeunte going before, servant do keep vocalem the vowell praesentis of the
present tense; caetera the rest mutant do change it in i into i, de quibus of
which haec these intelligo to understand, diligo to love, negligo to neglect,
tantum only faciunt make praeteritum their preterperfect tense lexi, omnia
reliqua all the rest legi.

NVnc now dis^as thou may learn formare to form supinum the supine ex
praeterito of the preterperfect tense. By format sibi forms tum in the
supine, namque for sic so bibi to drink fit is made bibitum. Ci fit is made
ctum, ut as vici to overcome victum, and and ici to smite testatur shows that
dans giving ictum, feci to do factum, quoque also ieci to cast ^actum. Di fit
is made sum, ut as vidi to see vi suni; quaedam some geminant ss double ss, ut
as pan^i to ^pen passum, sedi to s^ sessum* add add thou scidi to cut quod
which dat gives scissum atque and fidi to cleave sissum, quoque also fodi to
dig fossum. Hic beer etiam also advertas thou may mark, quod that
syllaba prima the first syllable, quam which praeteritum the preterperfect
tense vult geminari will have doubled non geminatur is not doubled supinis in
the supines, que and toto^di to clip or sheare docet teaches id that dans
giving tonsum, atque and cecidi to beat quod which makes caesum, and and
cecidi to fall quod which dat gives casum, atque and tete^di to bend quod
which makes tensum and tentum, tududi to knock tunsum atque and pepedi to
bre^ke wind backward, quod which format forms peditu^: add add thou dedi to
give quod which iure by right vult will have datum. Gi fit is made ctum, ut as
legi to read lectum, pegi to join* que and pepigi to make a bargain dat
gives pactum, fregi, to break fractum, quoqe also tetigi to touch tactum, egi
to do actum, pupugi to prick punctum, fugi to flee dat gives fugitum. Li fit
is made sum, ut salli stans pro condio sale signifying to season with salt
salsum, pepuli to drive out dat gives pulsum, ceculi to break culsum atque
and fefeli to deceive falsum, velli to pluck up dat gives vulsum, quoque also
tuli to bear habet has latum. Mi, ni, pi, qui, these terminations of the
praeterperfect tense fiunt are made tum, velut as manifestum is manifest hic
here: emt to buy emptum, veni to come ventum, cecini a cano to sing cantum,
cepi a capio to take dans giving captum, a coepio to begin coeptum, rupi a
rumpo to break ruptum, quoque also liqui to leave lictum. Ri fit is made sum,
ut as verri to brush versum, excipe except peperi to bring forth young partum Si
sit is made sum, ut as visi to go to see visum, tamen notwithstanding ss
geminato being doubled misi to send formabit will form missum, excipe except
fulsi to underprop fultum, hausi to draw haustum quoque also sarsi to patch
sartum, farsi to sluffe fartum, vssi to burn vstum, gessi to bear gestum,
torsi to writhe duo two supines tortum and torsum, indulsi to make too much of
one requirit requires indultum que and indulsum Psi fit is made ptum, vt as
scripsi to write scriptum; excipe except campsi to exchange campsum Ti fit is
made tum, namque for statu^ fit is made commune common praeterito to the
preterperfect tense steti a of sto to stand, stitique and stiti a of sisto to
make to stand, excipe except verti to turn versum Vi fit is made tum, ut as
flaui to blow flatum: excipe except paui to feed pastum* laui to wash dat
gives lotum interdum sometimes lautum atque and lauatum, potaui to drink
facit makes potum and and interdum sometime potatum: Sed but faui to favor
fautum, caui to beware cautum: forms thou may form rite very well satum a
of sero seui to sow, liui to daube or to smeare over que and also lini dat
gives litum, solui a soluo to loose solutum, volui a voluo to role volutum
singultiui to sob vult will have singultum, vaeneo venis vaeniui to be sold
vaenum, sepeliui to bury rite by right sepultum Quod a verb which dat gi^^th
ui, dat gives itu^, ut as domui to make tame domitu^ excipe except quoduis
verbum every verb in uo, quia because semper alway^s formabit it will form
ui, in utum, ut as exui to put off exutum deem except rui a ruo to rush dans
giving ruitum, secui to cut vult will have sectum, necui to kill nectum, que
and fricui to rub frictum, item also miscui to mingle mistum, ac and amicui to
cloth dat gives amictum, torrui to roast habet has tostu^, docui to teach
doctum, que and tenui to hold te^tum consului to give or ask counsel
consultum, alui to feed altum que and alitum: Sic so salui to leap faltum,
colui to worship quoque also occului to hide cultum, pinsui to bake habet has
pistum, rapui to snatch raptu^, que and serui a sero to plant vult will have
sertum, sic quoque so also texui to weaue habet has textum. Sed but haec these
mutant do change ui in sum into sum, nam for censeo to think ^ensum, cellui
to break habet has celsum, meto messui ^o reap habet ha^h quoque also
messum, item and nexui to knit nexum: sic quoque so also pexui to kembe habet
h^th pexum, patui to lie open dat gives passum, carui to want cas sum, que and
caritum Xi fit is made tum, ut as vinxi to bind vinctum, que and quinque five
abjiciunt cast away n in supino in the supine, nam for finxi to feign fictum,
minxi to make water mictum, pinxi to paint dat gives pictum, strinxi to
strain, quoque also rinxi to grinne rictum, flexi to bend, plexi to punish,
fixi to fasten dant give xum, and and fluo to flow fluxum.

Quod que compositum supinum every compound supine formatur is formed ut as
simplex the simp^e, quamvis although no^ stet there is not, semper always
eadem syllaba the same syllabl^ ut^ique in them both: composita the compounds a
of tunsum to knock dempta n when n is taken away tusum: a of ruitum to rush, i
media dempta when the middle letter i is taken away fit is made rutum, and and
quoque ^lso a of saltum to dance sultum: composita the compounds a of sero ^o
s^we dant give situm quando when format it forms satum. Haec these supines,
captum to take, factum to do, jactum to cast, raptum to snatch, mutant do
change a per e a into e, and and cantum to sing, partum to bring forth, sparsum
to sprinkle, carptum to crop or pluck up, quoque also fartum to fluffe. Verbum
the verb edo to eat compositum being compounded non facit makes not esum,
sed but estum: vnum one compound comedo to eat up duntaxat only formabit will
form vtrumque both Duo two compounds a of nosco to know, cognitum to know, and
and agnitum to know by some token tantum only habentur are had in use, caetera
the rest dant give notum: noscitum est is iam now in nullo vsu in no use.

VErba in or verbes ending in or admittunt take praeteritum a preterperfect
tense ex posteriore supino from th^i^ latter fupine, u verso being turned per
us into us, and and sum vel fui co^sociato being joined thereunto, ut a^ a of
lectu lectus sum vel fui. At but horum of these verbes nunc sometimes est is
deponens a deponent, nunc some times est is commune a common notandum to be
noted. Nam for labor to slide lapsus, patior to endure dat gives passus, and
and nata eius his compounds, ut as compatior to suffer alike compassus, que and

QVaedam verba certa ne verbes accipiunt tak^ praeteritum the preterperfect
tense aliunde of another incoeptiuum a verb inceptiue in sco, stans standing
pro primario for the primative verb adoptat takes praeteritum the
preterperfect tense eiusdem verbi of the same verb ergo therefore tepesco to

to remember.

FVgiunt these want praeteritum their preterperfect tense, vergo to bend,
ambigo to doubt, glisco to desire greatly, fatisco to ^hinke, polleo to be able
nideo to shine. ad haec to these are added incoeptiua verbes inceptiues, ut as

The Syntaxis construed.
VErbum personale a verb personal cohaeret agrees cum no minativo with his
nominative case numero in number and and persona person: ut as via the way ad
bonos mores to good manners est is nunquam never sera late. Fortuna fortune est
is nunquam n^uer perpetuo always bona good. Nominativus the nominatiu^ case
primae vel secundae personae of the first or second person rarissime exprimitur
is very seldom expressed nisi except discretionis causa for difference sake:
ut us vos ye damnastis have condemned, quasi as though dicat he should say
nemo none praeterea besides; aut or emphasis gratia: for the better expressing
of the thing to be spoken: ut as tu even thou es art patronus eur patron, tu
even thou art pater our father; si tu deseris if thou forsake us, perimus we
are vtter^y undone: quasi as though dicat he should say, praecipue specially
and and prae alijs before others, tu even thou es art patronus our patron. Tu
even thou eras wast mihi to me Dominus a Lord, tu even thou vir a husband: tu
even thou frater a brother. In verbis in verbs, quorum significatio whose
signification tantum only pertinct belongs ad homines to men, nominativus
the nominative case tertiae personae of the third person saepe oftentimes
subauditur is understood, ut as est he is, fertur he is reported, dicunt they
report, ferunt they report, aiunt they say, praedicant they tell it abroad
clamitant they cry it abroad, and and in similibus in such like, ut as fertur
he is reported designasse to have committed atrocia flagitia heinous offenses*
Que and ferunt they report poenituisse that it has repented te thee irae tuae
of thy anger. Vox casualis a casual word non est is not semper always
nominatiuus ^he nominative case verbo to the verb sed but aliquando sometimes
verbum infinitum a verb of the infinitive mood: ut as mentiri to lie non est
is not meum my property. Aliquando sometimes oration a sentence: ut as Add
add this quod that didicisse to have learned ingenuas arts the Liberal
Sciences fideliter faithfully, emollit mollifi^^h mores men^ manners, nec sinit
and carries them not esse to be fer^s brutish* Aliquando sometime aduerbium an
aduerbe cum genitiuo with a genitive case, ut as partim virorum part of the
men, cecederunt were slain in bello in war; partim signorum part of the
ensigns sunt combusta were burned. Verba verbes infiniti modi of the
infinitive mood statuunt set ante se before themselves accusatinum an
accusative case pro nominatiuo for a nominative: ut as gaud eo I am glad te
redijsse that thou art returned incolumem safe. Volo I will te agere that thou
play fabulam a comedy Hic modus this mood potest may resolui he dissolved per
quod and ut by quod and ut ad hunc modum after this manner: ut as gaudeo I am
glad quod that tu redijsti thou art returned incolumis safe. Volo I will ut
that tu agas thou play fabulam a comedy. Verbum a verb positum placed inter
duos nominatiuos between two nominative cases diuersorum numerorum of diverse
numbers potest may conuenire agree cum alterutro with either of them: ut as
Irae the falling out amantium o^ lovers redintegratio est is the renewing
amoris of love Quid enim for what nisi but vota prayers supersunt remain?
Percussit she struck pectora her breast, quoque also pectus her breast robora
fiunt was made oak Hic here nihil nothing nisi but carmina verses desunt are
wanting. Impersonalia imparsonalis non habent have not nominatiuum a nominative
case, praecedentem going before them: vt as taedit me I am weary vitae of life.
Pertaesum est I am weary coniugij of wedlock, de quibus whereof suo loco I
will entreat in their place. Nomen a noune multitudinis of multitude singular
singular quandoque sometimes iungitur is joined verbo plurali to a verb
plural, ut as pars part ab^e^e are gone: vterque both deluduntur are mocked
dolis with deceit.

ADiectiuum the Adjective consentit agreeeth cum substantiuo with the
substantive* genere in gender, numero number, and and casu case; ut as Rara
auis a rare bird in terris in the earth, que and similima most like nigro cygno
a black Swanne. Ad eundem modum after the same manner participia participles,
and and pronomina pronounes adnectuntur are joined substa^tiuis to
substantives, ut as Donec so long as eris thou shall be foelix in prosperity
numerabis thou shall number multos amicos many frien^s. Nullus amicus no friend
ib^t w^ll go ad amissas opes to lost riches. Pectora mea my breast non
senserunt has not felt. hoc vulnus this wound primum now the first time, tuli
I have suffered grauiora more grievous. Aliquando sometimes oration a sen^ence
supplet does supply locum the place substantiui of a substantive: ut as audito
when it was heard regem proficisci that the King went Doroberniam to Canterbury.

RElatiuum the Relative concordat agrees cum Antecedente with the Antecedent
genere in gender, numero number and and persona person: ut as Quis who est is
vir bonus a good man? Qui he that servat keeps co^sulta the statutes patrum
of his forefathers qui he that keeps leges their laws, iuraque and
ordinances Nec solum and not only vnica vox one word alone sed etiam but also
interdum sometimes oration a sencence ponitur is put pro antecedente for the
antecedent: ut as Veni I came in tempore in seuson ad eam to her, quod which
est is primu^ the chiefest omnium rerum of all things. Relativum a Relative
collo catum placed inter duo antecedentia between two antecedents diuerforum
generum of diverse genders nunc sometimes convenit agrees cum priore with the
former: ut as Senatus the enate peragebat keept assiduam stationem their dai^y
meeting eo loco in that place qui which hodie at this day appellatur is called
Senaculum the Senatehouse. Non procul not far off ab eo flumine from that River
quod which vocant they call Saliam Salia. Stella the star Iouis of Jupiter,
quae which dicitur is called Phaeton, fertur is carried propius a terra not
far from the earth. Nunc sometimes cum posteriore with the latter: ut as
homines men tuentur do defend illum globum that round thing quae which dicitur
it called terra the earth. Est there is locus a place in carcere in the prison
quod which appellatur is called Tullianum a dungeon. In coitu Iunae in the
coniuuction of the Sun and Moon quod which vocant they call interlunium the
space between the old Moon and the new. Aliquando sometimes Relativum a
Relative aliquando sometimes and also Nomen Adjectivum a Noune adjective
respondet has relation primitivo to the primative, quod which subintelligitur
is understood in possessivo in the possessiue. ut as Omnes all men dicere did
say omnia bona all good things, and and laudare did praise fortunas meas my
good hap, qui who haberem had filium a son praeditum endued tali ingenio with
so good a nature. Vidisti thou have seen nostros occulos our eyes fle^tis of
me weeping. Quo ties as often as nullus nominatiuus no nominative case
interseritur is put inter relatiuum between the relative and verbum and the
verb, relatiuum the relative crit shall be nominatiuus the nominative case
verbo to the verb: ut as Faelix he is happy qui which potuit could visere go
to see fo^tem lucidum the clear fountain boni of goodness. At but si if
nominatiuus the nominative case interponatur be put between relati^o the
relative and verbo and the verb, relatiuum the relative reg^tur shall be
governed a verbo of the verb, aut or ab alia dictione of another word quae
which locatur is placed cum verbo with the verb in oratione in the sentence:
ut as Gratia thanks abest is wanting ab officio from that good turn quod which
mora lingering tardat delayeth. Cuius numen whose dei^ie adoro I worship.
Quorum whereof ego habeo I have optimu^ the best. Cui to whom non vidi I have
not seen similem the like. Quo whereof iudicaui I have thought te thee dignum
worthy. Quo than whom nemo none scribit writes melius better. Quem videndo in
seeing of whom obstupuit he was amazed. Lego I read Virgilium Virgil prae quo
in comparison of whom caeteri Poetae the other Poets sordent are of very small
account.

QVum when duo substantiva ^wo substantives diuersae significationis of diverse
significations sic concurrunt do so come together, ut as posterius the latter
quodammodo after a sort videatur may seem possideri to be possessed a priore
of the former, tum then posterius the latter ponitur is put in genitiuo in the
genitive case ut as Amor the love nummi of money crescit increases quantum as
much as ipsa pecunia the money it self crescit increases* Rex the King pater
is a father patriae of the Country. Arma the weapons Achillis of Achilles.
Cultor a tiller agri of the ground. Proinde further hic genitivus this
genitive, case saepissime very often mutatur is changed in adiectiuu^
possessiuu^ into an adjective possessiue: vt as Domus the house patris of my
father, paterna domus my fathers house. Filius the son heri of my master,
Herilis filius my masters son, Est there is a time etiam also vbi when
vertitur it is turned in datiuum into a dative case: vt as Est he is pater a
Father vrbi to the City que and maritus a husband vrbi to the City. Herus a
master tibi to thee: Pater a Father mihi to me. Excipiuntur nounes are excepted
quae which connectuntur are put together in eodem casu in the same case per
Appositionem by apposition: vt as opes riches irritamenta the allurements to
malorum evils effodiuntur are dug out of the earth. Arcent they drive away a
praesepibus from their hiues fucos the drones ignauum p^cus being a sluggish
cattle. Adiectiuum an adjective positum put in neutro genere in the neuter
gender absolute absolutely, hoc est that is absque substantiuo without a
substantive aliqua^do sometimes postulat requires genitiuum a genitive case,
vt as paululum paecuniae a little money. Hoc noctis this night Non videmus we
see not manticae that wallet quod which est is in tergo on the back. Quantum
nummorum so much money as quisque every one seruat keeps in arca sua in his
ch^st, habet he has and tantu^ fidei even so much credit Interdum sometimes
genitiuus the genitive case ponitur is put tantum alone, nempe that is priore
substantiuo the former substantive subaudito being understood, per Eclipsim by
Eclipsis: vt as in locutionibus in speeches huiusmodi of this kind: vbi so
soon as veneris thou shall come ad Dianae to Diances temple, ito go thou ad
dext^ ram on the right bond: Ventu^ erat he came ad Vestae to Vestaes temple:
vtrobique in both places subauditur there is understood templum a temple. And
romache Hectoris the wife of Hector: uxor a wise subauditur is understood.
Deiphobe* Glauci the daughter of Glauc^^: filia a daughter subauditur is
understood. Video I see Byrthia Byrrhia huius this man's servant: subaudi
understand thou seruum a servant. Laus the praise and and vituperium the
disprayse rei of a thing effertur is used varijs modis diverse w^yes, at but
frequentius more commonly in ablativo in the ablative case vel or genitiuo the
genitive: ut as vir a man nulla fide of no credit Puer a boy ingenui vultus of
a comely countenance, que and ingenui pudoris honest bashfulnesse. Opus need
and and vsus need exigunt require ablatiuum an ablative case. ut as opus est
nobis we have need authoritate tua of thy authority. Non accepit he
received not pecuni^m money, qua whereof sibi nihil esset vsus he had no need
ab ijs of them, quibus whom s^iret he know vsui esse had use of it. Quandoque
autem but sometimes opus videtur seems* poni to be put adjective adiectiuely
pro for necessarius necessary, que and construitur is c^^si^ued vary diversely:
ut as Dux a captain and and author a guide opus est is necessary nobis for
us. Dicis thou say nummos money opus esse to be necessary mihi for me ad
apparatum for the preparation triumphi of the triumph. Para provide alia other
things quae which sunt are opus necessary. Intelligo I understand ex tuis
literis by your letters operam that the labor Sulpitij of Sulpitius non fuisse
has not b^en^ multum opus very necessary tibi for thee.

A Diectiua adjectives quae which significant signify desiderium desire,
notitiam knowledge memoriam remembrance, atque and contraria things contrary
ijs to them, genitivum adsciscunt govern a genitive case ut as natura the
nature hominum of men est is auida desirous nouitatis of news Men's a mind
praescia foreknowing. futuri that which is to come. Esto be thou memor
mind^full breuis aeui, of thy short age. Illicis enticest thou in fraudem into
deceit eductos young men brought up libe^e honestly imperitos rerum void of
experience? Non sum I am not dubious doutbfull animi of mind, sed but devius
swaruing from aequi right. Rudis ignorant Graecaru^ literarum of the Greek
^ongue. Adiectiua adjectives in ax verbalia derived of verbs etiam likewise
ferun^ur in genitiuum govern a genitive case: ut as Audax aduenturous ingenij
of nature. Tempus time edax a consumer rerum of things. Virtu^ virtue est is
fugax an abandoner vitiorum of vices Sagax quick in espying vtilium pr^fitable
things. Tenax stiff^ in propositi his purpose. Tam as well tenax a keeper ficti
of a lie, que and praui that which is naught, quam as nuncia a teller very of
the truth. Petax an ask^r pecuniarum of money. Praeterea besides ingens turba a
very great multitude adiectiuorum of adjectives abstricta bound nullis certis
regulis to no certain rules postulat requires casum patrium a genitive case.
Quorum farraginem satis quidem amplam a sufficient company whereof Linacrus
Linaker and and Dispanterius Despauter congesserent have gathered together. Tu
vero but thou lectione crebra by often reading reddes shall make ea them
admodum familiaria very samilliar tibi to thy self. Nomina partitiua noun^s
partitiues, aut or posita put partitiue partitiuely, interrogatiua quaedam
certain interroga^iues and and certa numeralia some nounes of number gaudent
gen^tiuo govern a genitive case, a quo of whom and also mutuantur they borrow
genus their gender: ut as Quanquam although Marce fili s^nne Mark oportet it
behooves te thee iam audientem having already heard, Cratippum, Cratippus
annum a year idque and that Athenis at Athens abundare to abound praeceptis
with precepts que and institutis instructions philosophiae of Philosophy,
propter summa^ authoritatem for the very great authority and both doctoris of
thy master and and vrbis the city, quoru^ whereof alter the one potest can
augerete store thee scientia with knowl^dge; altera the other exemplis with
examples. Accipe take vtrum horum whether of these two mavis thou haddst
rather. Quisquis whosoever Deorum of the gods ille fuit he was. An what est
quisquam hominum is any man aeque miser such a wret^h ut as ego^? Nemo none
divum of the gods auderet durst promittere promise. Tres three fratrum of the
Brothers. Quatuor four judicum of the Judges. Nondum constat it is not yet
agreed upon quis who fuerit was octavus the eighth sapientum of the wiseman.
Romulus fuit was primus the first regum Romanorum of the Roman Kings. Tamen
yet in alio se^su in anoth^r sense exigunt they require ablativum an ablative
case cum praepositione with a preposition: ut as primus the first ab Hercule
from Hercules. Tertius the third ab Aenea from Aeneas. In alio vero sensu but
in another sense dativum a dative ut as secundus second nulli to none pietate
in godliness. Vsurpantur autem but they are used and also cum his
praepositionibus with these prepositions e, de, ex, inter, ante; ut as alter
the one e vobis of you est is Deus a God. Solus he alone de superis of the gods
above. Primus the chiefest inter omnes amongst all Lacoon ardens chafing
decurrit ran down summa ab arce, from the top of the Tower, primus being the
first ibi there ante omnes before all magna comitante caterva a great troop
accompanying him. Interrogativum the question, and and redditivum the answer
ejus thereof erunt shall be ejusdem casus the same case, and and temporis
tense: ut as Quarum rerum of what things est is there nulla satietas no fulness?
Divitiarum of riches. Quid rerum what business nunc geritut is now a doing in
Anglia in England? Consulitur they do consult de religione of religion. Haec
regula this rule fallit fails quoties as often as interogatio the question
fit is made per by cujus, a, um, ut as cujum pecus whose cattle? laniorum the
butchers. Aut or else per dictionem by a word variae syntaxeos of diverse
construction: ut as Accusasne what do you accuse furti of theft, an or
homicidij murder: an or utroque of both? Denique lastly fallit it fails cum
when respondendum est we must answer per possessiva by these possessiues,
meus, tuus, suus, etc. ut as Cujus whose est is hic Codex this book? Meus
mine. Comparativa nounes comparatiues and and superlativa superlatiues accepta
being taken partitive partitiuely exigunt require genitivum a genitive case,
vnde from whence and also sortiuntur they have genus their gender. Comparatiuum
autem but the comparatiue refertur is referred ad duo to two. Superlativum the
superlatiue ad plura to more: ut as Dextra the right hand est is fortior the
stronger manuum of the hands. Medius the middle est is longissimus the longest
digitorum of the fingers. Accipiuntur autem but they are taken partitive
partitiuely, cum when exponuntur they are expounded per by e, ex, of or from
aut or inter among: ut as Virgilius Virgil, doctissimus the most learned
Poetarum of the Poets; id est, that is ex Poetis of the Poets, vel or inter
Poetas among the Poets. Comparativa Comparatiues cum when exponuntur they are
expounded per by quam than ablativum adsciscunt govern an ablative case: ut as
Argentu^ silver est is vilius more base auro than gold, aurum gold virtutibus
then the virtues, id est that is quam than aurum gold, quam than virtutes the
virtues, Adsciscunt and alterum ablativum, they also govern another ahlatiue
case, qui which significat signifies mensuram the measure excessus of
exceeding: ut as Quanto by how much es thou art doctior better learned, tanto
by so much geras te behave thy self submissius more lowly. Tanto by so much,
qua^to by how much, multo by much, long by far, aetate by age, natu by birth,
apponuntur are put vtrique gradui to both degrees: ut as tanto by so much
pessimus Poeta the worst Poet omnium of all, quanto by how much tu thou art
optimus patronus the best patron omniu^ of al, Nocturnae lucubration^s night
studies habe^tur are accounted long periculosissimae exceeding dangerous. Es
thou ar^ long peritior far more skillful caeteris than the rest, sed tamen
but yet non multo melior not much better. Omne vitium eueryvice animi of the
mind, habet has in se in it self crimen a fault, tanto by so much conspectius
the more apparent, quanto by how much habetur he is accounted mayor greater
qui which peccat offends; Mayor the greater and and maximus the greatest
aetate by age, Mayor the greater and and maximus the greatest natu by birth.

ADiectiua Adjectives quibus wherein significatur is signified commodum
profit, incommodum disprofit, similitudo likeness, dissimilitudo unlikeness,
voluptas pleasure, submissio submitting aut or relatio belonging ad aliquid to
some thing, in dativum transeunt govern a dative case: ut as O sis O be thou
bonus good, que and foelix favorable tuis to thy friends Turba the troublesome
rout grauis being grievous paci to peace, que and inimica an enemy placidae
quieti to pleasing rest. Poeta a Poet est is finitimus of very great affinity
with oratori an Orator. Color the color qui which erat was albus white, nunc
now est is contrarius contrary albo to white. Iucundus pleasant amicis to his
friends, Supplex lowly omnibus to all, Si if facis thou causest ut that sit it
may be idoneus fit patriae for the Country, vtilis profitable agro for the
ground. Huc hither referuntur are referred substantiva Substantives, composita
compounded ex Praepositione of the Preposition con: ut as contubernalis a
chamber-fellow, co^milito a fellow-souldier, conseruvs, a fellow-seruant,
cognatus a kinsman, etc. Quaedam some ex his of these, quae which significat
signify similitudinem likeness etiam also Genitivo gaudent govern a genitive
case: ut as Quem metuis be whom thou fear erat was par like huius this man.
Patres Fathers censent think it esse to be aequum a meet thing nos that we
jamjam even lately a pueris from children nasci should become illico by and by
senes old men: neque esse and not be affines partakers illarum rerum of those
things quas which adolescentia youth fert brings. Es thou art similis like
Domini thy Master. Men's a mind conscia knowing recti the right. Praeterera
further regina ipsa the queen her self fidissima tui most true to thee
occidit is dead, dextra sua by her own right hand. Communis common, alienus
strange, immunis free, serviu^t do serve variis casibus diverse cases: ut as
Appetitus the desire conjunction is of Copulation procreandi causa for
procreations sakeest is commune a common thing anim^tium omnium to all living
creatures. Mors death communis is common omnibus to all men. Hoc this thing est
is common common mihi tecu^ to me and thee. Non aliena not unmeet for
consilij the purpose. Alienus far from ambitioni ambition. Non alienus not
estranged a studijs from the studies Scevolae of Sceuola. Dabitur it shall be
granted vobis to you esse to be immu nibus free from hujus mali this evil.
Caprificus the wild Fig Tree est is immunis free from omnibus ali. Sumus we
are immunes clear ab illis malis from those evils. Natus borne, commodus
profitable, incommodus unprofitable, vtilis profitable, inutilis unprofitable,
vehemens earnest, aptus fit, interdum sometimes, etiam also adjunguntur are
joined accu sativo to an Accusative case cum Praepositione with a Preposition:
ut as Natus borne ad gloriam to glory. Verbalia Verbals in bilis accepta taken
passive passiuely, vt as and also participia participles, seu potius or rather,
participialia participials, in dus, dativo adjecto gaudent will have a dative
case after them: ut as o Iuli O Julius, memora^ de mihi worthy to be remembered
of me post nullos sodales after none of my fellows* Lucus the wood erat was
penetrabilis to be pierced through nulli astro with no star.

MEnsura the measure magnitudinis of great nesse subijcitur is put after
adiectiuis adi^ctiues in accusatiuo in the Accusative case; v t as gnomon the
pin of the dial septe^ pedes longus seven foot long reddit makes vmbram a
shadow quatuor pedes longam four foot long non amplius not more. Et and
interdum sometimes in Ablativo in the Ablative: vt as Fons a Well latus broad

Item also verba verbes gestus of gesture ut as Sedeo I sit, dormio I sleep,
cubo I lie down, incedo I go, curro I run, expetunt require nominatiuum a
nominative case utrinque on either side: ut as Deus God est is summum bonum the

Fides faith habetur is counted fundamentum the foundation Religionis nostrae of

similia like eis to them accedunt come near them: ut as Hypocrita an hypocrite
cupit aesiresh videri to seem iustus just: Hypocrita an Hypocrtie cupit
desires se videri that he might seem iustum just. Malo I had rather esse

Vos esse that you should be bonas good. Me esse that I should be piam loyal.

wickedness. Cupido o Cupid parce forbear damnare to condemn vatem tuum thy
Poet sceleris of wickedness. Admoneto admonish illum him pristinae fortunae of

praepositione without a preposition; ut as Si es if thou be in iquus judex a
partial Judge in me against me ego te condemnabo I will comdemne thee eodem
crimine of the same crime. Grauiter accusauit he has grievously accused
vxorem his wife de pudicitia of unchastity. Putaui I thought te esse

PRius supinum the first S^^ine significat sig^ifieth active actiuely, and and
sequitu^ follows verbu^ a Verb aut or participium a participle significans
signifiing motu^ moving ad lo^u^ to a place: ut as Veniunt they came spectatum

the soldiers sunt missi are sent speculatum to view arcem the Tower. Illa vero
but those phrases Do I give vaenum to be sold, Do I give filiam my daugh^^^

redit he returns venatu from hunting, Cubitu and venatu videntur seem
censenda to be thought potius rather nomina nounes quam than supina supines.

QVae nounes which significant signify partem temporis part of time,
vsurpantur are used frequentius very often in ablatiuo in the ablative case
raro seldom in accusatiuo in the accusative: vt as Nemo mortalium no man
liling sapit is wise omnibus horis at all hours. Mendae blemishes latent are
not seen nocte by night. Id tempus about that time creatus est he was created
Consul Quamquam although hic in this place videtur there seems esse to be
eclipsis a defect praepo sitionis of the preposition per by vel or sub under.
Que autem but Nounes which denotant do signify durationem durance, and and
continuationem continuance temporis of time, efferuntur are uttered in
accusatiuo in the accusative, and interdum and sometimes in ablatino in the
ablative: vt as iam now hic in this place regnabitur kings shall reign ter
centum totos annos full three hundred years. Ianua the gate atri Ditis of the
black god of h^ll patet lies open noctes atque dies nights and days. Tamen
yet hic in this place poteris you may requiescere rest mecum with me hac nocte

SPatium the space loci of a place effertur is uttered in accusativo in the

coeli of heaven patet lies open tres vlnas three else non amplius no more, and

NOmina appellativa nounes appellatiues, and and nomina names maiorum locoru^
of greater places adduntur are added fere commonly cum praepositione with a
preposition uerbis to verbs significantibus signifying motum motion aut or
actionem action in loco in a place, ad locum to a place, a loco from a place,
aut or per locum by a place: ut as versatur he is c^nuersant in foro in the

genitive proprij nominis of the proper name loci of a place in quo wherein
actio an action fit is done, modo so that sit it be primae vel secu^dae
declinationis of the first or second declension, and and singularis numeri
singular number; ut as quid what faciam shall I do Romae at Rome? mentiri
nescio I ca^notly, Samia fuit was mihi matter my mother, ea she habitabat dwelt
Rhodi at Rhodes. Hi genitivi these genitiues, humi on the ground, domi at home,
militiae in war* belli in war, sequuntur do follow formam the form
propriorum of proper names; ut as viximus we lived simul together domi at home
bellique and in war. Arma weapons sunt are parva little worth foris abroad,
nisi except est there be consilium counsel domi at home. Domi at home non
patitur suffers not alios genitivos other genitive cases secum with him, quam
then meae mine, tuae thine, suae his, nostrae ours, vestrae yours, alienae
another man's ut as Vescor Ieate domi meae at mine own house, non alienae not
at another man's. Verum but si if proprium nomen the proper name loci of a place
fuerit be duntaxat only pluralis numeri of the plural number* aut or tertiae
declinationis the third declension ponitur it is put in dativo in the dative
case aut or ablativo ablative: ut as Colchus an Asian an or Assyrius a Syrian,
nutritus one brought up Thebis at Thebes an or Argis at A^gos. Gotulicus scribit
writes Lentulum genitu^ that Lentulus was borne Tyburi at Tybur. Praesidium
the garrison Anxuri at Anxur neglectum is neglect^d. Fuit he was Carthagine at
Carthage cu^ vna sola legione with one only band of soldiers. Ventosus I

Quum when tu thou mensas hospitu^ convomeres did vomit up thy hosts good
cheer, Narbone at Narbo^. Commendo I commend tibi unto thee domum ejus his
house, quae which est is Sycione at Sycion. Sic in like manner, vtimur we use
ruri vel rure in the country in ablatiuo in the ablative case; ut as Continet
se he keeps himself fere commonly rure in the country Est tibi thou have far
modicum a little corn rure paterno at thy fathers country farm. Proprium the
proper name loci of a place apponitur is put verbis to verbs significantibus
signifying motum a motion ad locum to a place, in accusativo in the accusative
case: ut as Concessi I went Cantabrigiam ^o Cambridge ad capiendum ingenij
cultum to get learning: Eo Londinum I go to London ad merces emendas to buy
wares. Ad hunc modum after this sort vtimur we vs^ ^us the country, and and

HAec tria impersonalia these three impersonals interest it makes matter or
forces, refert it skilleth or boote^h, and and est it concerns, annectu^tur
are joined quibuslibet genitivis to any genetiues praeter hos ablativos except
those ablatiues foemininos feminine. Mea mine, tua thine, sua his, nostra ours,
vestra yours, and and cuia whose; ut as Interest it concerns Magistratus a
Magistrate, tueri to defend bonos the good, animaduertere in malos to punish
the badde. Multum refert it is very profitable Christianae reipublicae for a
Christian common wealth, Episcopos esse that the Bishops be doctos learned and
and pios godly Est it is the point prudentis of a wise man dissimulare to wink
at multa many things: Tua refert it is expedient for thee nosce to know teipsum
thy self. Ea caedes that murder potissimum chiefly datur is imputed crimini a
crime ei to him cuia interfuit whom it concerned, non ei not to him cuia nihil
interfuit who^ it nothing co^cerned. Et also illi genitivi those genetiues
adjiciuntur are added. Tanti for so much as, magni for much, parvi for little,
quanticunque how great soever, tantidem for so much; ut as magni refert it is
greatly to be regarded quibuscum with whom vixeris thou leadest thy life.
Tanti refert it so greatly behooves agere to do honesta honest things: vestri
parva interest it little touches you. Et and interest it belongs ad meam
laudem to my commendation. Haec impersonalia these impersonals feruntur are
carried in dativum into the dative case: Accidit it falls out, certum est it
is sure, contingit it chances, constat it is manifestly known, confert it
helps, competit it agrees or is convenient, conducit it is good and
available, conuenit it is meet, placet it pleases, displicet it displeases,
dolet it grieueth, expedit it is expedient, euenit it happens, liquet it is
clear libet it contenteth or likes, licet it is lawful, nocet it hurts,
obest it hinders, prodest it profits, praestat it is better, patet it is
open, stat it is resolved, restat it remains, benefit it happens well,
malefit it happens ill, satisfit it is satisfied, superest it remains,
sufficit it is sufficient, vacat pro otium est there is leisure: ut as Conuenit
mihi tecum I and thou agree together. Praestat it is better mihi for me emori
utterly to dye per virtutem by my manhood, quam than viuere to live per dedecus
in disgra^e. Non vacat Iovi Jupiter is not at leisure adesse to be present
exiguis rebus at small matters. Dolet it grieueth imprudenti the unwary and
libero adolescenti and* frank young man dictum that it was spoken. Malefit it
falls out ill priuignis to sons in law a nouerca by their stepmother.
Benefit it comes well to pass nobis to us a Deo from God. Star mihi id est
statutum est I am determined renouare to renew casus omnes all hazards. Haec
impersonalia these impersonals, iuvat it delights, decet it becomes, cum
compositis with their compounds delectat it delights, oportet it behooves,
exigunt require* accusandi casum an accusative case: ut as iuvat me it
delights me ire to go per Altum by Sea. Decet it becomes vxorem a wife
curare to look to aedes her house. Dedecet it becomes not viros men rixare
to scolde muliebriter like women* Oportet it behooves patrem familias an
householder esse to be vendacem a seller, non emacem not a buyer: Praepositio
vero but the preposition, Ad, additur is added proprie properly his to these,
attinet it belongs, pertinet it pertains, spectat it tends unto or lies
upon, ut as Visne will you me dicere* that I speak quod that which attinet
belongs ad te unto thee? Spectat it belongs ad omnes to all been viuere to
live well, pertinet it appertains in vtramque partem to both parts.
Accusativus an accusative case cum genitivo with a genitive subjicitur is put
after his impersonalibus these impersonals Poenitet it repents, taedet it
irketh or wearieth, miseret it pittieth, miserescit it has compassion on,
pudet i^ sh^meth, piget it grieueth* ut as si if vixisset h^e had lived ad
centesimum annum to the hundredth year no^ poeniteret eum it would not repent him
senectutis suae of his old age. Taedet it irketh animam meam my soul vitae
meae of my life. Miseret te thou have compassion on aliorum others. Nec miseret
I neither pity, nec pudet nor am ashamed tui of thee. Quidem ind^ed piget it
grieueth, p^detque and ashameth me me fratris for my brother. Nonnulla
impersonalia some impersonalles remigrant do return back aliquando sometimes
in personalia into personals: ut as Arbusta the shrubbes humilesque miricae and
the low tamyrixses non juvant delight not omnes all men Namque for mollia regna
womanish kingdoms decent become animos tuos thy courage. A^bor a tree producta
ad frugem grown up to bear fruit delectat delights agricolam the
husbandman. Nemo no man commiserescit pittyetb miserorum the miserable. Non
pudet istud Does not this thing shame te thee? Non pudent haec Do not these
things shame te thee? Coepit it begins, incipit it begins, desinit it
cease, debet it ought, solet it is w^nt, and and potest it may juncta being
joined impersonalibus to impersonalles, induunt take upon them formam the form
impersonalium of impersonals, ut as ubi primum so soon as coeperit it began
non conuenire to be no agreement question a question oriebatur did arise. Solet
it is wont taedere to grieve avaros he covetous impendij of charge. Desinit it
cease taedere to grieve illum him studij of his study. Debet it ought pudere
to shame sacerdotem the priest inscitiae of ignorance. Non potest it is not
possible adsummu^ peruenire that the principal end should be attained nisi
but ex principijs by the beginnings. Verbum impersonale a verb impersonall
passiuae vocis of the passive voice obtinet has similem casum the like case
cum personalibus passivis with personalles passiues: ut as pugnatur ab hostibus
the enemies fought constanter without giving over. Qui quidem casus which case
indeed interdum sometimes non exprimitur is not expressed: ut as Discumbitur
they sit down strato ostro upon scarlet spread abroad. Verbum impersonale a
verb impersonall passiuae vocis of the passive voice potest may accipi be
taken pro singulis personis for every person utriusque numeri of both numbers
indifferenter indifferently ut as statur it is stood, id est, sto I stand, stas
thou stand, stat he stands, stamus we stand, statis ye stand, stant
they stand: videlicet that is to say ex vi by the force obliqui of an oblique
case adjuncti joined unto it vt as Statur a me, id est, sto I stand: Statur ab
illis, id est, stant they stand.

PArticipia Participles regunt govern casus the cases Verborum of the verbes,
a quibus whereof deriuantur they are derived: ut as Tendens holding duplices
palmas his two hands ad sidera toward the skies, refert voce he utters
talia such things. Capellae the young goats referent domum will come home
ubera their vdders distenta stretched out lacte with milk. Diligendus to be
beloved ab omnibus of all Quamvis al^h^ugh dativus the dative case est is
u^^tatior more used in his in these: ut as Chremes restat remains qui who est
is exorandus to be earnestly entreated mihi of me. Voces Participiorum
Participles cum when fiunt they are made nomina nounes, postulant require
genitivum a genitive case; ut as Appete^s greedy alieni of another man's goods.
Profusus lau^shing sui of his own. Cupientissimus most desirous tui of thee.
Inexpertus unexperienced belli in war. Indoctus unskillful pilae at the ball.
Exosus hating, perosus bearing a deadly hatred, pertaesus weary, significant
signify active actiuely, and and feruntur are carried in accusativum into an
accusative case: ut as Perosus utterly detesting immu^dam segnitiem foul
idleness. Astronomus an Astronomer exosus that abhors mulieres women ad
vnum in general. Pertaesus weary of ignaviam suam his own sloathfulnesse.
Exosus hated and and perosus hated unto death etiam also leguntur are read cum
dandi casu with a dative ease videlicet that is significantia signifying
passive passiuely: ut as Germani the Germa^s perosi sunt are utterly de^ested
Romany of the Romans. Exosus hated Deo of God. and sanctis and of the Saints.
Natus borne, prognatus borne, satus sown or sprung, cretus come up or ^rowne,
creatus created or formed, ortus risen, editus brought forth, in ablativum
feruntur govern an ablative case: ut as Bona an honest Damsel prognata borne
bonis parentibus of good parents. Sat O thou that art descended of sanguine
the blood Divum of the Gods. Quo sanguine of what blood cretus is he come?
Venus o^ ta mari come of the Sea, praestat mare makes the Sea better eunti for
the passengers. Editus brought forth of terra the earth.

EN and Ecce Aduerbia aduerbs demonstrandi of showing adiunguntu^ are joined
frequentius very often nominativo with a nominative case, rarius very seldom
accusativo with an accusative: ut as En lo where is Priamus, etiam hic even
here sua praemia his rewards sunt laudi are his praise. Ecce lo what is
status noster our state tibi for thee. En see quatu^r aras four alta^s: Ecce
see duas two tibi for thee, Daphni Daphnis, duoque altaria and two altars
Phoebo for Phoebus. En and ecce exprobrantis aduerbs of vpbraiding nectuntur
are knit solum accusativo to an accusative case only, ut as En animum see his
disposition and mentem and his mind. En habitum see his fashion: Ecce autem but
lo alterum another. Quaedam adverbia certain aduerbes loci of place, temporis
of time, and and quantitatis of quantity, recipient take genitivum a genitive
case post se after them. Loci of place; ut as vbi where, vbinam in what place,
nusquam no where: eo thither, long by far, quo whither, vbivis in any
place, hucci, ne what hither? ut as Vbi gentium in what country? Quo terrarum
into what part of the world abiit is he gone? Inuenitur he is found nusquam
loci in no place. Ventum est it is come to eo impude^tiae that impudence.
Temporis of time; ut as nunc now, tunc at that time, tum then, interea in the
mean while, pridie the day before, postridie the day after: ut as Poteram I
could do nil nothing tunc temporis at that time amplius more quam than flere
weep. Inierant they entered pugna^ the fight pridie the day before eius diei
that day: pridie the day before Calendaru^ seu Cale^das the Calends Quantitatis
of quantity: ut as paru^ a little, satis enough, abunde sufficient: ut as
satis eloquentiae wards enough, sapientiae parum little wisdom. Audiuimus we
have ^eard abunde fabularum tales enough. Instar signifi^at signifies
aequiparationem equality or matching, me^suram measure, aut or similitudine^
likeness: ut as Aedificant they build equum an horse divina art by the divine
art Palladis of Pallas instar montis as big as a mountaine^ Philippus Philip
solus alone mittitur is sent, in quo erat instar omnium auxiliorum who could
do as much as all helpers besides. Sed but hoc scelus this wicked act habet
has pondus the weight and and instar the measure meriti of a reward. Hic in
this place interdum sometimes praepositio the preposition ad apponitur is put
to: ut as Vallis the dale clauditur is enclosed ad instar castrorum even as a
camp, Populus Romanus the people of Rome e parua origin from a small
beginning emicuit is grown up ad instar to the likeness tantae magnitudinis
of so great bigness: a^ alas minime gentium no in no wise non faciam ^ will
not do it: Hic genitivus this genetiue case gentium additur is added
festiuitatis causa for elegancie sake. Quaedam certain aduerbes dativum
admittunt govern a dative case nominum of the nounes vnde whereof sunt deducta
they are derived: ut as Venit he came obviam illi to meet him Nam for obuius
illi to mee^e him dicitur is spoken. Canit he sings similiter huic lik^ this
man. Et and vivit he lives inutiliter unprofitably sibi to bimselfe. Sedet
he sits propinquius nearer tibi thee qu^m than mihi me* Et also hi dativi
these datiues sunt are adverbiales like aduerbes: Tempori by time, luci by day,
vesperi in the evening: ut as Venit he came tempore by time quod which est is
primum the chiefest omnium rerum of all things. Occidit he slew hominem a man
luci by day. Vidi I saw it affer^i brought ad vos to you vesperi in the evening
Sunt there are some quae which accusandi casum admittunt govern an accusative
case praepositionis of the preposition, unde whereof sunt profecta they are
com^: ut as Castra the tents moventur are moved proprius nearer vrbem the
City. Mauri the Moors sunt are proxime next Hispaniam Spain. Cedo
flagitantis an aduerbe of one earnestly desiring exhiberi to be given or
presented regit governs accusativum an accusative case, ut as Cedo appoint
quemv is arbitrum any arbitratour. Adverbia aduerbs diversitatis of diversity,
aliter otherwise secus otherwi^e, and and illa duo these two, ante post* non
raro inueniu^tur are not seldom found cum ablativo w^^h an ablative case, ut
as Multo aliter much otherwise; Paulo secus little otherwise: Multo ante much
before: long secus far otherwise. Venit he came longo post tempore a long
time after. Paulo post, a little after. Nisi except and also ipsa they sunt
censenda be to be thought potius rather aduerbia aduerbs. Aduerbia aduerbs
comparatiui and superlativi gradus of the comparatiue and superlatiue degree
casus admittunt govern the case assuetos accustomed subservire to be set
after comparativis the comparatiues and and superlativis superlatiues, sicut as
est it is praeceptum taught ante before: ut as accessit he came p^oprius
nearer illo then the other. Dixit he sp^ke optime bes^ omnium of all Legimus
we read proprius nearer ad deos to the Gods, and and proprius a terris the
less sp^ce off from the earth. Paulo plus somewhat more trecenta vehicula than
three h^ndred chariots amissa sunt are lost. Plus more duo millia hominum than
two thousand men, caesa slains eo die that day. Plus more reperitur is found
junctum joined nominativo to a nominative case, genitivo a genitive, accusativo
an accusative, and and ablativo an ablative: ut as Plus more quam than
quinquaginta hominum fifty men ceciderunt were slain. Acies the army abierat
was gone paulo plus a little more quingentos passus than five hundred pases.
Fui I have been in nave in the ship triginta dies thirty days a^t or plus eo
more then that.

QVibus modis with what moodes verborum of verbes quae adverbia what aduerhs
co^gruant do agree. Vbi when postquam after that, and and cum when aduerbia
aduerbes temporis of time apponuntur are put interdum sometimes indicativis
verbis with indicative verbs, interdum vero and sometimes subiunctivis with
subiunctiues, ut as Vbi when dedit he gave haec dicta these words. Vbi when
nos we laverimus have washed, si if voles you will, lavato wash you. Cum when
faciam vitula I shall sacrifice a young Cow pro frugibus for corn, ipse venito
come thou. Cum when canerem I sang of Reges Kings and and praelia wars,
Cynthius Apollo aurem vellit twitched me by the care. Hic in this place prius
the former videtur seems esse to be aduerbium an aduerbe, posterius the
latter coniunctio a conjunction. Donec pro for quamdiu so long as gaudet
rejoices indicativo with an indicative mood: ut as Donec so long as eram I
was sospes safe. Pro for quousque until exigit requires nunc sometimes
indicativum an indicative mood, nunc sometimes subiunctivum a subiunctine: ut
as Donec until iussit he bade cogere to gather oves the sheep stabulis in the
sheepfolds numerumque refer and to count them. Donec until ea aqua that
water quam which adieceris thou have added sit be decocta boiled. Donec whiles
that eris thou shall be foelix rich numerabis thou shall number multos amicos
many friends Dum, de re praesenti of a thing present, non perfecta not perfect,
aut or pro for quamdiu so longas, poscit requires faciendi modum the
indicative mood: ut as Dum whilst that virgo the maid apparatur is a making
ready in conclaui in the inner parlour. Ego volo I will have te thee dici be
called meum my son, tantisper dum so long as facis thou do quod that which
est is dignum beseeming te thee. Dum pro for dummodo so that, nectitur is
joined alias one while potentiali to the potentiall, alias another while
subiunctiuo to the subiunctiue; ut as; du^ so that prosim I may profit tibi
thee. Dum so that ne comperiam I find not me falli that I am deceived ab hoc
by this sellow. Dum pro for donec until tantum only subiunctivo to the
subiunctiue; ut as Dum until tertia aestas the third summer viderit shall see
regnantem him reigning Latio in Italy. Quod pro for quamdiu as long as
adhibetur is put vel either Indicativis to Indicatiues vel or subiunctivis
subiunctiues: pro for Donec until, subiunctivis solis to subiunctiues only:
ut as Quoad as long as expectes thou expectest contubernalem thy chamber
fellow. Quoad as long as possem I could and and liceret might, nunquam
discederem I would never depart ab eius latere from his side. Seruabo I will
keep omnia all things integra entire and whole quoad until exercitus the army
huc mittatur be sent hither. Simulac as soon as simulatque as soon as
adhaere^t cleave to indicativo the indicative mood, and and subiunctivo
subiunctiu^, ut as Simulac as soon as erat he was patiens able to abide belli
war. Simula^que as soon as aetas age adoleverat waxed ripe. Quemadmodum even
as, ut as vtcunque howsoever, sicut as vtrunque admittunt modum govern both
moods ut as; Vt even as salutabis thou shall salicte, ita so and also
resalutaberis thou shall be saluted back again. Vt as feceris sementem thou
have sown, ita so and also metes shall thou reap. Vt pro for postquam after
that iungitur is joined indicativo to the indicative: vt as, Vt after that
ventum est they came in vrbem into the City. Quasi as, ceu as, tanquam as,
perinde acsi even like as, haud sccus acsi no otherwise then as, quum when
habent they have proprium verbum a proper verb, apponuntur are put subiunctivo
to the subiunctiue mood: ut as Tanquam as though ipse thy self feceris have
done aliquid somewhat. Quasi as if non norimus nos we know not our selves
inter nos amongst our selves. Alias otherwise copulant they couple consimiles
casus like cases: ut as Noui I knew hominem the man tanquam te even as thy
self. Arridet mihi he smiles on me quasiamico as on a friend. Ne prohibendi
an aduerbe of forbidding praeponitur is set before vel either imperat^^^
Imperatiues, vel or subiunctivis subiunctiues, ut as Magna sacerdos o great
prophetess ne saevi be not so eager Hic he est is magnus ne bulo a great
knave, ne metuas do not fear him. Ne pro for non net inseruit caeteris modis
gouerns other moods. Aduerbia aduerbes casu accedente if a case be added
transeunt in praepositiones are turned into prepositions: ut as vacuus viator
the moneylesse traveler cantabit will sing coram latrone before a thief.

COnjunctiones copulatiuae conjunctions copulatiues, and and disiunctivae
disiunctiues, cum his quatuor with these four, quam than, nisi except
praeterquam save that, an whether, omnino nectunt do altogether join similes
casus like cases: ut as Socrates docuit taught Xenophontem Xenophon and and
Platonem Plato. Vtinam I wou^d to God esses thou were calidus warm^, aut or
frigidus cold. Nescio I know not an whether homo the man sit be albus white an
or ater black. Est he is minor natu younger quam than tu you Placet he
pleases nemini none nisi except vel or praeterquam save sibi himself.
Exceptio an exception, si if aliqua priuata ratio some private reason casualis
dictionis of a casual word repugnet gainesay, vel or p^scat require aliud
another thing* ut as Emi I bou^ht librum a bo^ke cen tussi for an hundred asses
or a noble, and and plutis more. Vixi I lived Romae at Rome, and and Venetijs
at Venice. Descendat let it sink in aures into the ears Meti Iudicis of
censuring Metius, and and patris your father, and and nostras mine
Conjunctiones copulatiuae conjunctions copulatiues and and disiunctiuae
disiunctiues aliquoties sometimes conglutinant couple similes modos like moodes
and and tempora tenses: ut as Stat he stands recto corpore with his body
upright dispicitque and looks down at terras the ground. Aliquotiesautem but
sometimes similes modos like moodes, sed but diuersa tempora diverse tenses. ut
as Nisi but that lactasses thou had allured me amantem me being in lou^
and and produceres drewest me on vana spe with vain hope. Egi I have given
tibi thee gratias thanks and and aliquando sometimes possum may callaudare te
commend thee. Etsi albeit, tametsi although, etiamsi although, quanquam
howbeit, in principio in the beginning orationis of a sentence postulant
require indicativos modos indicative moodes, in medio in the middle, saepius
very often subiunctivos subiunctiues Quamvis although, and and licet although,
frequentius more often subiunctivos subiunctiues; ut as Etsi although nihil
noui no news afferebatur was brought, Quanquam although animus my mind horret
is aghast meminisse to remember. ^^^mvis although Graecia Greece miretur admires
at Elysios campos the Flysian fields. Licet albeit Homere o Homer ipse thy
self venias do come comitatus accompanied musis with the Muses, si if
attuleris thou have brought nihil nothing, for as out of door Homere o Homer
ibis shall thou go. Ni but that, nisi except, si ^f, si quidem for truly,
quod because, quia for as much as, quam than, postquam since that, posteaquam
after that Vbi pro for postquam since that, nunquam never, priusquam before
that, adhaerent cleave to and both indicatiuis indicatiues and and subiunctivis
subiunctives: ut as Gaudeo I am glad quod redie^is because you are returned
incolumis safe. Castigo te I chasten thee non quod odio habe am not because I
hate thee, sed quod ame^ but because I love thee. Indicas you show alium
honestum another manner of honesty quam than Philosophi the Philosophers
statuunt set down; accusas thou ac^^sest gravius more grievously quam than tua
consuetudo thy custom patitur permits. Si if iungitur is joined vtrique
modo to both moodes. At but si if pro for quamuis although tantum only
subiunctivo to the subiunctiue ut as Redeam should I return? non no si me
obsecret although she entreat me. Si quis if any tantum only indicativo to
the indicative: ut as Si quis if any adest be present. Quando since that,
quandoquidem for as much as, quoniam because iungitur are joined indicativo to
an indicative ut as Dicite say on, quandoquidem for as much as consedimus we
are set together in molli herba in the soft grass: Quoniam because mihi non
credis thou belieuest me not, ipse facito periculum thou thy self make trial.
Quippe surely for as much as cum when habet it has proprium verbum a proper
verb gaudet indicativo gouernes the indicative: ut as Venia pardon danda est
is to be given huic to this man, quippe surely aegrotat he is sick* Si
addideris if you add qui which, vtrumque admittit modum it governs both
moodes: ut as Venia pardon non est is not danda to be given huic to this man
quippe qui as he that peierauit sieve peierauerit is forsworn iam already bis
twice. Qui, cum when habet it has vim causalem the force of a reason, postulat
requires subjunctivum a subiunctiue: ut as Es thou art stultus a fool qui
credas seeing that thou creditest huic this sellow. Cum pro for quamvis
although, pro for quandoquidem seeing that, vel or quonia^ because semper
evermore adhaeret eleaueth to subiunctivo the subiunctiue: ut as Cum although
nos dicamus we say nihil posse that nothing can praecipi be deliu^red in
precepts, tame^ yet solemus are we wont disserere to discourse de alijs rebus
of other matters. Grandive O Mars cum seeing that sis thou art aptus fit
virilibus officijs for manly charges. Cum and and tum, item also tum geminatum
doubled copulant couple similes modos like moodes. Est autem but there is in
cum quiddam minus a certain less thing, atque and ideo therefore statuitur it
is placed in priore part in the former part clausulae of the clause, in tum
quiddam maius a certain greater thing, ac and pro inde therefore collocatur it
is set in posteriore part in the latter part clausulae of the cause: ut as
Amplectitur he makes much of cum both omnes eruditos all learned men tum
inprimis and especially Marcellum Marcellus. Odit he hates tum both literas
learning tum and also virtutem virtue. Ne what, an whether, number whether or no,
particulae particles interrogandi of asking amant do love indicativum the
indicative mood: ut as Superatne is he alive and and vescitur aura aetherea
breathes he? At but cum when accipiuntur they are taken dubitative doubtfully
aut or indefinite indefinitely postulant they require subiunctivum the
subiunctiue: ut as vise goesee number whether redierit he be returded* Nihil
refert it booteth nothing at all fecerisne whether you have done it, an
persuaseris or persuaded it. Vt coniunctio causalis a conjunction causall seu
or perfectiva perfect, and and ut pro for ne non lest not, post verba after
verbs timoris of fear jungitur is joined nunc sometimes potentiali to the
potentiall, nunc sometimes subjunctivo to the subiunctiues: ut as Perduxere
they brought illue thither filium mcum my son, ut to the end that esset he
should he vna together secum with them. Dave o Dau^s te oro I entreat thee, ut
that jam now redeat he may return in viam into the way Metuo I fear ut
substet id est ne non substet hospes that this stranger will not abide constant
Vt concedentis a conjunction of yielding, seu or positum put pro for quanquam
although, and and ut pro for utpote for as much as, seruet serves subjunctivo
the subiunctiue: ut as, ut albeit omnia all things co^tingunt should fall out
quae which volo I would non possum I cannot leuari be eased. Non est tibi
fide^dum no trust is to be given thee ut qui toties fefelleris decause thou
have so often deceived, ut qui fueris for as much as thou have been relictus
left solus alone* Vt pro for postquam after that, pro for quemadmodum as, vel
or sicut l^ke as and and interrogativum an interrogatiue nectitur is coupled
indicativis with indicatiues: ut as Vt after that discessi I departed ab vrbe
from the Citi^, intermisi I omitted nullam diem no day quin scriberem but I
wrote. Tamen yet perge tu go thou forward facere to make has nuptias this
marriage, ut as facis thou do. Credo I think so, ut est dementia like as is
his madness Vt valet how fares he? Vt how meminit remembers he nostri us?
Quanquam although dictu^ est we spoke paulo supra somewhat hefore de hoc of
this quoque also in constructione in the construction aduerbij of an aduerbe.

PRaepositio a preposition subaudita understood interdum sometimes facit
causes ut that ablatiuus an* ablative case addatur be added: ut as Habeo te I
have thee loco id est in loco in stead parentis of a father. Apparuit he
appeared illi unto him humana specie id est sub humana specie under the shape
of a man. Discessit he is departed magistratu id est a magistratu from his
office. Praepositio a preposition in compositione in composition, nonnunquam
sometimes regit governs eundem casum the same case, quem which and also
regebat it governed extra compositione^ without composition: ut as nec posse
and not to be able auertere to turn away Regem the King Teucrorum of Trojans
Italia from Italy? Praetereo te. I pass by thee insalutatum unsaluted. Posts
the posts emoti cardine moved out of their places, procumbunt lie flat on the
ground. Detrudunt they thrust naves the ships scopulo from the rock. Verba
verbs composita compounded cum with a, ab, ad, con, de, e, ex, in, nonnunquam
sometimes repetunt repeat easdem praepositiones the same prepositions cum suo
casu with their case extra compositionem without composition, id que and that
eleganter elegantly: ut as abstinuerunt they have abstained a viris from men.
Advocabo I will call amicos my friends ad hanc rem to this business.
Conferemus we will compare cum legibus with the laws. Nunquam cogitavi I
never thought detrahere to detract de tua fama from thy good name. Cum when
euaseris thou art escaped ex insidijs out of snares. Postquam after that
excessit ex ephebis he passed out from among the young striplings. Incumbe in
Rempublicam be careful of the Commonwealth cogitatione with thy cogitation
curaque and care. In pro for erga toward, contra against, and and ad to habet
has accusativum an accusative case: ut as, Accipit she takes animum mentemque
benignam a courteous mind and meanning in Teucros toward the Trojans. Quid
tantum what so great matter meus Aeneas could my Aeneas committere commit in te
against thee. Quid what potuere could Troes the Trojans? Quo te Moeri pedes,
Mer^s whether go thou? an what in urbem into the City quo whither via the
way ducit leads? Item lik^wise In iungitur is joined accusativo to an
accusative case, quoties so often as diuisio division mutatio change aut o^
incrementum the increase rei of a thing cum tempore with time significatur is
signified: ut as Estque and there is locus a place ubi where via the way find
it se deuideth it self in ambas parts into two parts. Troja Troy versa est is
turned in cineres into ashes, viro sospite ^^ husband being safe. A^or love
crescit mihi grows in me in horas every hour. In, cum when actus an action
in loco in a place significatur is signified, postulat requires ablativum an
ablative case* ut as scilicet forsooth; ut as fulvum aurum yellow gold
spectatur is tried in ignibus in the fire: Sub pro for, ad to, per by or
through, and and, ante before innititur leans to accusativo an accusative: ut
as Properemus let us hasten sub vmbram to the shadow. Legati the Embassadoures
fere in a manner, sub id tempus id est per id tempus about that time missi are
sent ad res repetendas to recover the things lost. Cura care recursat begins a
fresh sub noctem id est paulo ante noctem a little before night vel or instante
nocte the night approaching. Alias otherwise ablativum admittit it gouernes an
oblatiue: ut as aetas time in apricum proferet will bring into open light
quicquid whatsoever est is sub terra under the ground. Sub nocte silenti id est
in nocte silenti in the silent night. Super pro for vltra beyond jungitur is
joined accusativo to an accusative case, ut as Proferet he will extend imperium
his empire super Garamantes beyond the Africans, and and Indos Indians. Super
pro for de of, and and in ablativo to an ablative: ut as Multus variusque rumor
manifold and diverse report super ea re of that matter. Super viridi fronde upon
green branches. Subter under vno significatu in one signification jungitur is
joined vtrique casui to both cases apud authors with authors; ut as Pugnatum
est they fought supra above subterque and under terras the ground. Libet it
likes me far to endure omnes casus all hazards subter densa testudine under
a thick shelter. Tenus up to gaudet rejoices ablativo with an ablative, and
both singulari singular, and and plurari plural: ut as Pube tenus up to the
privy parts. Pectoribus tenus up to the breasts. At but genitivo with the
genitive plurali plura i tantum only: ut as Crulrum tenus up to the thighs*
Praepositiones prepositions, cum when amittunt they loose casum their case,
migrant in aduerbia do change into aduerbes: ut as Venit he came longo post
tempore a long time after. Coniux my wife subit follows pone beh^nde, feremur
we are carried per opaca locorum through dark places Aeneas I Aeneas Troius the
Trojan quem whom quaeritis ye s^^ke, adsum am here coram in presence.

INterjectiones Interiections ponuntur are put non raro often absolute
absolutely, and and sine casu without case: ut as Connixa she yeaning reliquit
left spem gregis the hope of the flock, ah alas in nuda silice upon the bare
flint stone. Quae dementia what madness malum with a mischief? O exclamantis
an interiection of exclamation jungitur is joined nominativo to a nominative,
accusativio an accusative and and vocativo a vocative, ut as O festus dies O
ioysull day hominis of man. O nimium fortunatos o too too fortunate agricolas
husbandmen, si if norint they knew sua bona their own good: o formose puer o
fair lad, nimium ne creed trust not too much colori to thy beauty: Heu alas
and and proh adhaerent cleave nunc sometimes nominativo to a nominative nunc
sometimes accusativo to an accusatine: ut as Heu pietas ah the godliness. Heu
prisca fides ah the ancient faithfulness, Heu stirpem inuisam ^h ^dious
stock. Proh Jupiter oh Jupiter, tu homo thou fellow adiges me ad insaniam wilt
carry me beside myself. Proh fidem oh the faith Deum of God atque and hominu^
of men. Proh sancte Jupiter oh holy Jupiter. Hei alas and and veh alas
apponuntur are put dativo to a dative case* ut as Hei mihi we is me quod that
amor love est is medicabilis to be healed nullis herbis with no hear^s. Veh
misero mihi woe is me poor wretch that I am, quanta de spe from how great hope
decidi am I fallen?

Incumbensstudio thou applying thy lesson loqueris shall speak submissa voce
with a loud voice* dum reddis nobis all the while thou art saying with me eris
thou shall be canorus loud voce with thy voice: Et and quaecunque whatsoever
reddis thou repeatest mihi to me, discantur ad vnguem let them be learned at
thy fingers end and and libro abjecto thy book laid aside read rehearse
verbula singula every word Nec suggerat quisquam and let no body prompt vllum
verbum any word dicturo when thou art saying, quod which parit brings non
mediocre exitium no small hurt puero to a child. Si rogito If I demand
quicquam any thing, stu debis thou shall endeavor respondere to answer sic so
ut that mereare thou may deserve laudem praise and and decus commendation
dictis by thy answers. Non laudabere thou shall not be commended lingua nimis
celeri for too fast a tongue aut tarda or too slow: medium the mean est is
virtus a grace quod tenuisse which to keep iuuat delights. Et and quoties as
often as loqueris thou speak, esto memor be mindsull loquare that thou
speak Latin Latin, and and fuge avoid verba barbara barbarous words
veluti as scopulos things very dangerous. Praeterea besides instrue teach
socios thy fellows quotiescun que so often as rogabunt they shall ask te
thee, and and tralie bring forward ignaros the ignorant ad mea vota to my
desire. ipse he qui which docet teaches indoctos the unlearned, licet
although esset he were indoctissimus most unlearned, queat may esse be doctior
better learned reliquis then the rest brevi in a short time. Sed but tu nec
imita bear thou shall not imitate stolidos grammaticastros foolish authors of
barbarism, ingens dedecus the exceeding great disgrace eloquij Romani of the
Latin tongue. Quorum whereof nemo none est is tam fatuus so f^olish aut tam
barbarus or so barbarous ore in speech, quem autorem whom as an author turba
barbara the barbarous multitude non probet allows not* Si vis if thou will
recte cognoscere rightly kn^w leges grammaticas the laws of the grammar, si
cupias if thou desire di^cere to learn loqui to spe^ke cultius very
elegantly ore in thy speech, add^scas see thou learnest scripta clarissima the
most famous writings vete^um virorum of ancient men: and and authors the
autho^s quos which turba Latina the better sort of Lat^^^^^ docet teaches.
Nunc sometimes Virgilius Virgil optat wishes amplecti te to embrace thee, nunc
sometimes ipse Terentius Te rence himself nunc sometimes simul with^ll opus
the work Ciceronis of Cicerto te wishes thee. Quos whom qui non didicit he
that has not learned vidit has seen nil nothing praeter somnia but dreams,
and and certat strives viuere to live in tenebris cimmeriis in great
ignorance. Sunt there are some boys quos delectat whom it deligh^eth
posthabito studio having laid aside the study honestae virtutis of commendable
virtue conterere to spend tempora their time nugisin trifles. Sunt there are
others quibus est cordi who take pleasure solicitare to trouble sodales their
fellows manibus with hands pedibusve or feet, aut or alio quovis modo any
other way. Est there is alius another qui who dum whilst iactat he boasts se
himself clarum noble sanguine by blood, improbat disalloweth genus parentage
reliquis in others insulso ore with unsavory spee^h. Nolem te sequi I would not
have thee follow tam praua vestigia so bad patterns morum of manners, ne lest
tandem in the end feras thou receive praemia rewards digna worthy factis thy
deeds. Dabis thou shall give aut vendes or sell nil nothing, permutabis thou
shall change emesve or buy nil nothing, feras thou shall receive nulla commoda
no profit ex damno by the loss alterius of another. Et and insuper moreover
mitte leave nummos money irritamenta malorum the inticements to evil alijs to
others, nil nothing nisi but pura things free from abuse decent become puerum a
child. Clamor noise, rixa brabbling, ioci scoffings, mendacia lies, furta
th^ft, cachinni scornful laughter sint procul a vobis let them be far from
you, and and arma Martis fighting procul far off* Dices thou shall speak nil
nothing penitus at all quod which sit is turpe filthy, aut or non honestum not
honest. Lingua the tongue est is janua the gate vitae of life, pariter ac necis
and of death too: Creed account it ingens nefas horrible wick^dnesse referri to
give maledicta evil words cuiquam to any one, aut or jurare to swear by
numina fac^a the sacred tit^es Dei magni of almighty GOD. Denique to conclude,
seruabis thou shall keep res omnes all thy things, atque and libellos books:
Et and feres shall bear them tecum with thee quoties as often as isque both
thou go redisque and returnest. Effuge avoid vel even causas the occasions
quaecunquc whatsoever faciunt do make thee nocentem offensive and and quibus
wherein potes thou may displicuisse nobis displease me.

FINIS.
