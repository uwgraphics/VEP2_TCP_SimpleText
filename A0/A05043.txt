king Alyxander the conqueroure
Ne Salamon in his most honor
Ne yet Charlemayne the rich king
Had they never such a thing
He found in that pauylyon
The kings daughter of Mylyon
That is an isle in fayry
In oxyan full nere thereby
There lay a bed of much price
Covered over in goodly wise
Thereon sat a maiden bright
Almost naked up right
All her clothes beside her lay
Full sengle she sat I say
In a mantell of white armyne
Covered over with gold full fine
The mantell down for hete she did
Right under the gyrdell stead
There was she as white as lylly in may
Or snow that fallethe in winter day
Blossom on brere ne flower
Was nothing to her color
The reed rose that was so new
To her reednesse was it no hew
Lamwell she said my heart sweet
For thy love my heart I let
There is no king ne emperor
That and I loved him paramoure
As much as I do now the
But they wo'de be right glad of me
Lamwell beheld that lady bright
Her love him rauysshed anon right
He sat him down the lady beside
Damoysell he said tide what betyde
Evermore both loud and still
Command me right at your will
Sir knight she said curtoyse and hende
I know thy state both first and end
Will thou trystly to me take
And all other for me forsake
I shall maintain thine honor
With gold and silver and rich treasoure
On every man spend greatly
And rich gifts largely
The more thou spend the meryer thou sit
I shall the find enough of it
His love burnt like the fire
For than she had all his desire
Of her pro^^r he was full bl^^^^
(...)
Also they washed and down set
And at soupere togethere they ete
Mete and drink they had plente
Of every thing that was daynte
After soupere when day was gone
To bed they went both anon
All that night they lay in fere
And did that their wylles were
For play they sleped little that night
Till it began to be day light
Lamwell she said rise and go now
Gold and silver take enough with you
Largely to spend on every man
For ye shall have enough than
And when ye will gentle knight
To speak with me by day or night
Unto some secret place ye go
And think on me so and so
And I shall anon with you be
No man save you shall se me
Of one thing sir I the defendaunte
Of me sir to make thine auaunte
For if thou do beware beforne
For ever thou have my love forlorn
The maidens brought him his horse anon
He takes his leave and forth is gone
Of treasure he has great plente
And so rode he thrughe the cite
When that he came there he should been
A meryer man had they not seen
Him self he rode full rychely
And his squyers full stoutely
Lamwell makes the noble feestes
Lamwell find mynstrelles that gestes
Lamwell byethe the great stedes
Lamwell gives the rich wedes
Lamwell geuethe plentye of mete and drink
Lamwell help there as he need could think
Lamwell reward relygyous
Lamwell helped every pore house
For were he knight squyre or swayne
With his goods he helped them
Of his largenes every man wot
But no man knew how he it got
And when him lyked pryuely and still
His lady was ready at his will
Well happy were now that man
That in these days had such one
But on a time sir Gawayne
That curtoys knight and sir Ewayne
Sir Lamwell with them also
And other knights twenty and mo
Went to play them on the grene
Under the tower there as was the queen
These knights on their game played tho
And sithe to daunsynge began they go
Sir Lamwell was before set
For his large spence they loved him bet
The queen in her tower beheld this all
She said yonder is large Lamwell
Of all the knights that been there
Is none so fair a bachelere
And has neither lemman ne wise
I would he loved me as his life
Betyde me well betyde me ill
I shall she said go wete his will
She took with her a company
Of damoyselles that were right praty
And gothe her down anon ryghtes
For to dance with the knights
The queen went to the first end
Between Gawen and Lamwell the hende
And all her maidens so forth ryghtes
One and one between two knyhhtes
When all the daunsynge did as lake
The queen Lamwell to counsel began take
Shortly she said thou gentle knight
I have loved and does with all my might
And as much desire I the
As Arthoure the king so fre
Good hap is now to the taken
To love me and none other woman
Madame he said nay certays
I will not be traytoure never my days
I owe the king feate and homage
Shall I never do him that damage
Fie on the thou false cowarde
Dastarde harlot that thou art
That thou lyuest it is pity
That love no woman nor woman the
Me think harlot thou should be feign
And answer me with ye again
Sith I the love ywys
Before all that in the court is
But as thou art so thou do
No woman on the will make boost
The knight was sore agreued tho
And answered he and said right so
Madame he said thou say thy will
I can love both loud and still
And am loved with my lemman
That fayrer has no gentylman
Nor none so fair this say I
Neither maiden nor yet lady
That the symplest maid with her I wene
Over the madame might be a queen
Then was she a shamed and full wroth
She cleped her maidens and forth gothe
To chaumbre she went all heavy
For tene and anger she would dye
king Arthure came from hunting
Glad and merry for all thing
To the queen's chaumbre gone is he
And she fell down upon her kne
Sone lord began she cry
Help me lord or I dye
And without ye Judge right
I shall dye this enders night
I spoke with Lam well on my game
And he besought me of shame
As a full vylayne traytoure
He would have done me dyshonoure
And of a lemman praysement he made
That the symplest maid she had
Might be a queen over me
And all lord in dyspyte of the
The king therwih waxed wroth
And for anger he swore his oath
That Lamwell should abydethe law
To be hanged and draw
He commanded four knights
To fetch the traytoure forth ryghtes
The four knights seeks him anon
But to his chamber was he gone
Alas he said my life is lorne
Hereof she warned me beforne
Of all things that I did use
Of her should I never make rouse
He cleped and called and her besought
But all that auayled him naught
He wept and sorowed and he did cry
And on his knees he prayed her of marry
He beat his body and his heed eke
And cursed his mouth of her did speak
O my lady o gentle creature
How shall my wretched body endure
My worlds bliss I have forlorn
And falsely unto my lady forsworn
For sorrow and care he made that stounde
He fell on sown upon the ground
So long he lay that the knights came
And in his chamber they took him than
And as a the (...)

Lamwell answered with mylde mode
And told him the sothe every word
That it was none otherwise than so
That would he make good tho
What all the court would to him look
Twelve knights were put to a book
The sothe to say in that case
All together as it was
These twelve knights as I wene
knew the rule of the queen
All though the king was bold and stout
She was wicked out and out
And she had such a comfort
To have lemmans under her lord
Whereby they could all tell
It was long of her and not of Lamwell
Here of they quyte a true man
And sithe they spoke forth on
That if he might his lemman bring
Of whom he made his auauntynge
And if he might prove in place
That her maidens fayrer was
And also bryghter and shene
And of more beauty than the queen

That her maidens fairer was
And also brighter shene
And of more beautye then the queen,
And also of countenance and of hew
They would quite him as true
if he might not stand there til,
He should abide the kings will,
This verdit was given before the king
The day was set her in to bring
Suerties her found to come again
Sir Gawayne, and sir ^wayne,
Aals (he said (I shall dye,
My lyese I shall never see with exe
Eat nor drink would he never,
But in weeping and woe was ever,
So is he with sorrow nome
He would his endyng (...) come
Each (...)
For a large (...)
Came never in that country
Thereto was he fires and bold
Never a better in the kings household,
The day was come of his appearing,
They brought the knight before the king,
His borowes that his suertyes was,
To appear before the kings face
The king let it be rehearsed there
Both the plenty and his answer,
He had him bring his Lemon in sight,
And he answeret, that he ne might.
The words that I said each one
Wete ye well I lied of none
If I so might be taken thereby,
In that quarrel would I dye
For this I say to you a lone
A Fairer then she was never none
But of beautys and of shape
I am to simple to touch her lape
There was never man yet I wate
Emperor king, or high estate
Where ever they dwell far or nere
For her fairenes might be her pere
Nor yet come within her boure,
But if it were for her pleasure
I would desire no more of right
But once of her to have a sight
Truly my lord for no more would I care
Forthwith then to death would I fare
Not to displease her sikerly
Yet would I ye saw her or I dye,
But it is not al my willing
It is as she will that worthy thing,
Bring her forth the king says,
That thou now so fast do praise,
To prove the soth that thou say of,
Forsooth my lord that can I not,
The king said unto him thore,
Forsooth thy disworship his the more.
What may we know al hereby
But that thou lie loud and hye.
The barons all had commandment.
