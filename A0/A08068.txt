THE CONFESSION of faith of certain English people, living in exile, in the Low
countries.

Together with a brief note of the special heads of those things wherein we
differ from the Church of England.

2 Cor. 4, 13. We beleev: therefore have we spoken.

Harmony of Confess. in the preface set before it, in the Name of the French
and Belgic Churches. The Prelates and Priests always cry out, that we are
Heretics, Schismatics, and Sectaryes. Howbeit let them know that the crime of
Heresy is not to be imputed to them whose faith does wholly rely upon most sure
grounds of the Scripture; That they are not Schismatics, who entierly cleave
to the true Church of God, such as the Prophets and Apostles do describe unto
us; Nor they to be counted Sectaryes, who embrace the truth of God which is one
and always like it self.

To the reverend and learned men, Students of holy Scripture, in the Christian
Universities, of Leyden in Holland, of Sanctandrewes in Scotland, of
Heidelberg, Geneva, and other the like famous schools of learning in the Low
countries. Scotland, Germany, and France.
The English people exiled, in the Low countries, wish grace and peace in Jesus
Christ.
THis true Confession of our faith, in our judgment wholly agreeable to the
sacred Scripture, we here exhibit unto al to be discussed: and unto you
(reverend Sirs) we dedicate it for two causes. First, for that we know you are
able in respect of your singular knowledge in the Scriptures, and hope you are
willing in respect of your sincere piety, to convince our errors by the light
of Gods word, if any where we err out of the way. Secondly, that this
testimony of Christian faith, if you also find it to agree with the word of
truth, may by you be approved, either in silence or by writing, as you shall
think best.

It may be, we shall be thought very bold, that being despised of all, yet
doubted not to solicit you so many and so great learned men. But this we did,
partly at the request of others to whom we would not deny it; partly with
desire to have the truth through your help more defended and further spread
abroad; partly constreyned by our exile and other calamities almost infinite;
partly also moved with love of our native country, and of these wherein now we
live and others else where; wishing that al may walk with a right foot to the
truth of ehe G^sspel, and praying daily unto God, that the great work of
restoring religion and the Church decayed, which he has happily begun in these
latter times, by our Gracious Sovereign and the other Princes of these
countries and ages (his servants) he would fully accomplish, to the glory of
his name and ^ternal salvation in Christ of his elect in all places of the earth.

Touching the causes which moved us to publish this Confession of faith, and to
forsake the Church of Eugland as now it stands, we have truly and as briefly
as we could related them, in the Preface to the Reader, hereafter following:
and therefore thought here to omit the repetition of them. The Lord Jesus always
preserve you and your Vniversityes to the praise of his name, the ornament of
good learning, the propagation and maintenance of his pure Religion.

The preface to the Christian Reader.
IT may seem strange unto thee (Christian Reader) that any of the Englysh
nation should for the truth of the Gospel be forced to forsake their native
country, and live in exile, especially in these days when the Gospel seems
to have free passage and flourish in that land. And for this cause have our
exile ben hardly thought of by many, and evil spoken of by some, who know not
(as it seems) either the true estate of the Church of England, or causes of
our forsaking and separation from the same, but hearing this sect (as they call
it) to be every where spoken against, Act. 28 2
have (without all further search) accounted and divulged us as heretics, or
Schismatickes at the least. Yea some (and such as worst might) have sought the
increase of our afflictions, even here also if they could: which thing they
have both secretly and openly attempted. This has Satan added unto all our
former sorrows, envying that we should have rest in any part of the inhabited
world, and therefore cease not to make war with the remnant of the woman's
seed, Rev, (...)
which keep the comco^maundements of, God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
^al. 105. ^, 14.
But the Lord that brought his former Israel out of Egypt and when they walked
about from nation to nation, from one Kingdom to an other people, suffered no
man to do them wrong, but reproved Kings for their sakes: the same Lord yet
lives to mainteyn the right of his afflicted servantes, who^ he has severed,
and daily gathers out of the world, Pet. 2, 9.
to be unto himself a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, Psalm. 46, 1
a peculiar people and Israel of God: He is our hope and strength and help in
troubles ready to be found, he will hyde us under his wings, and under his
feathers we shall be sure, until these miseries be overpast.

And though we could for our parts well have borne this rebuke of Christ in
silence, and left our cause to him who judges justly all the children of men:
yet for the manifestation and clearing of the truth of God from reproaches of
men, and for the bringing others together with our selves to the same knowledge
and fellowship off the Gospel, we have thought it needful and our duty to make
known unto the world, our unfeigned faith in God, and loyal obedience toward
our Prince and all Governers set over us in the Lord, together with the reasons
of our leaving the Ministry worship and Church of England. Which are not (as
they pretend) for some few faults and corcorruptions remaining, such as we
acknowledge may be found in the perfectest Church on earth: Neither count we it
lawful for any member to forsake the fellowship off the Church for blemishes
and imperfections, which every one according to his calling should studiously
seek to cure, and to exspect and further it, until either there follow
redress or the disease be grow incureable, Rev. 2. 5.
and the candlestick be moved out of the place. But we having through Gods
mercy learned to discern betwixr 2 Cor. 6. 1. ^* 15. etc Psa. 94. 20.
the true worship of God and the Antichristian leitourgy; the true ministry of
Christ and Antichristian prelacy; 2 These. 2. 3.
the ordinances of Christ's testament and Popish canons: have also learned to
leave Ps. 37. 2^* Ier. 51. 6.
the evil and choose the good, to forsake Babell the land of our captivity,
and get us unto Sion the mount of the Lords holiness, Rev. 18. 4. and 14. 1.
and place where his honor dwells.

But first we desire thee, good Reader, to understand, and mind that we have
not in any dislyke of the Civil estate and politic government in that Common
wealth, which we much like and love, separated our selves from that Church:
Neither have we shaken of our allegiance and dutiful obedyence to our
Sovereign PRINCE, the honorable Counselors, and other Magistrates set over
us, but have always and still do revere^ce love and obey them every one in the
Lord, opposing our selves against all enemies foreign or domestical: against
all invasions, insurrections, treasons or conspiracies by whomsoever intended
against the Prince and the State, and are ready to adventure our lives in their
defense, if need require. Neither have our greatest adversaryes ever ben able
to attaint us of the least disloyalty in this regard. And though now we be
exiled, yet do we daily pray and will for the preservation peace and prosperity
of our Sovereign Prince and all the dominions of that kingdom.

And whereas we have been accused of intrusion into the Magistrates office, as
going about our selves to reform the abuses in that land, it is a mere
malicious calumny, which our adversaries have forged out of their own heart.
Neh. 6. 6. 7. ^.
We have always both by word and practice showed the contrary, neither ever
attempted or purposed any such thing: but have endeavored thus only to reform
our selves and our lives according to the rule of Gods word, by absteyning from
al evil and keeping the commandments of Jesus: leaving the suppressing and
casting out of those remnants of Idolatry, unto the Magistrates, to whom it
belongs.

And further we testify by these presents unto all men, and desire them to take
knowledge heerof, that we have not forsaken any point of the true Ancient
Catholic and Apostolic faith professed in our land: but hold the same
grounds of Christian religion with them still, agreeing likewise herein, with
the Dutch, Harmon. of Confess.
Scottish, Germane, French, Helvetian, and al other Christian reformed Churches
round about us, whose Confessions published, we call to witness our agreement
with them, in matters of greatest moment, being conferred with these Articles
of our says following. The things then only against which we contend, and
which we mislike in the E^glish parish assemblies, are many reliqu^s of that
m^n of sin (whom they pretend to have abandoned) yet retained among them, and
with a high hand maynteyned, vpholden, and imposed. The particulers whereof
(being almost infinite) cannot well of us be set down, and would be tedious and
yrksome to thee (good Reader:) But the principal heads we will truly relate,
and that ^o briefly as in so large and confuse a subject we can.

First, in the planting and constituting of their Church (at the beginning of
Queen Elizabets reign) they receyved at once into the body of that Church, as
members, the whole land, which generally then stood for the most part professed
Papists, who had revolted from the profession, which they made in the days of
King Edward of happy memory, and shed much blood of many Christian Martyrs in
Queen Maryes days. This people yet standing in this fearful sinful state, in
Idolatry, blyndnes, superstition, and all manner wickedness, without any
professed repentance, and without the means thereof, namely the preaching of
the word going before, were by force and authority of Law only compelled, and
together received into the bosom and body of the Church, their seed baptized,
themselves receved and compelled to the Lords supper, had this ministry and
service (which now they use) enjoined and set over the^, and ever since they
and their seed remain in this estate, being all but one body commonly called
the Church of England. Here are none exempted or excluded, be they never so
profane or wretched, no Atheist, adulterer, thief, or murderer, no liar,
perjurer, Witch or conjurer, etc* al are one fellowship, one body, one Church.
Now let the law of God be looked into, and there will be found, that such persons
1 Pet. 2. 5. Ier. 51. 26.
are not fit stones for the Lords spiritual house, no meet members for Christ's
glorious body. None of years Act. 2. 38. 40. 41. and 8. 36. 37. and 15 9. Ioh
10. 3. 4 5. Esa. 35. 8. 9.
may be received into the Church without fr^e professed faith repentance and
submission unto the Gospel of Christ and his heavenly ordinances. Neither may
Ioh. 15. 2. 5. Mat. 18. 15. 17 Lev. 13. 46. Number. 4. 13.
any contynew there longer then they bring forth the fruyts of faith, walking
as becomes the Gospel of Christ. Christ Jesus John. 15. 19. and 17. 14. 16
Mat. 3. 12. Lev. 20. 24. ^6. 1 John. 4. 5. 6.
has called and severed his servants out of and from the world. How then
should this confused and mixed people be esteemed the orderly gathered true
planted and right constituted Church of God?

Secondly, as they have retained the whole ^rout of the popish multitude
without any distinction, for members of their Church* so have they set over
them (as reason was) the same popish Clergy and Prelacy, which they receved
from the Romish Apostasy, and this day is to be found in the popish Churches:
About forty ecclesiastical popish offices are at this day in the Church of
England, never a one appointed by Christ in his Testament.
to wit, Archbs, Primates, Bbs. Metropolitanes, Suffraganes, Archdeaco^s,
Deanes, Chauncellors, Commissaries, and the rest of that rabble, which rule and
govern these assemblyes according to the Popish Canons, Rites, and Customs.
These have the power and authority in their hands to set forth Injunctions,
to make and depose Ministers, to excommunicate both Priests and people, which
they do very exquisitly, if they yield not unto them their due homage and
obedience. These have both Ecclesiastical and Civil authority, to reign as
Princes in the Church and live as Lords in the Common wealth, to punish,
imprison, and persecute even to death all that dare but once mutter against
their unlawful proceedings. Of these Prelates tyranny cruelty and unlawful
authority, the better sort both of preachers and people have cried out, and
long time sued unto the Prince and Parliament to have them removed out of the
Church as being the lymmes of Antichrist. But not prevayling. they are now
content (for avoiding of the cross of Christ) to submit themselves and their
souls to this Antichris^tian Hierarchy, and bear the sinful yok^ and burden
of their traditions, and to re^ceive and carry about the dreadful and
d^^testable mark of the Beast upon them.

Thirdly, the inferior ministry of tha^ Church, consists of Priests,
Parsons, Vi^cars, Curats, hired preachers or Lecturers, with Clerks and other
like Officers, which have received their offices callings and authority from
their forenamed Lords the Prelates to whom they swear their canonical
obedience, and promise to perform it with al^ reverence and submission. Their
office i^ to read over the service book and Bbs Decrees thereby to worship God,
With what words and rites, in what habit and gesture, these things are to be
done, they are taught in their Rubrik.
to marry, to bu^ry, to church women, to visit the sick, give him the
Sacrament, and forgive him al his sins: and if their livings or benefices (as
they are called) amount to a certain su^me of money in the Princes book, then
must they preach, or get some other to preach for them four sermons in a year
in their parish. Where also must be noted that the most part of these Priests
are utterly unlearned, and cannot preach at all: whereby it comes to pass
that most of the people are as blind as they were in the dark days of popery.
These Ministers generally, as well preachers as other, live in fear and
servitude under their foresaid Lords the Bbs. For as without their license
written and sealed they cannot preach, so upon their displeasure and for not
obeying their injunctions, they are many times suspended, degraded, and if they
will not be ruled, put in prison: so that sundry of the^ have been suspended and
imprisoned for preaching against the Prelates, not subscribing to their devised
Articles and Book of common prayer, not wearing the sqare cap and surplice,
not reading the service book, and be tied to the same, not coming to the Bbs
courts, visitations, inquisitions, etc. till now of late being wearyed with
these troubles, they give place to their tyranny, and are content to conform
themselves, and yield their canonical obedience according to their oath,
^eeping now silence, yea going back, bearing and bolstering the things which
heretofore by word and writing they stood against, so long as there was any
hope that the Prince and Counsel would have hea^kened unto them, and put these
adversary Prelates out of the Church.

Fourthly, for administration, which is by Law imposed upon all both Clergy
and Laity, (for so they distinguish them) they have gathered their Service
book verbatim out of the Mass book, turning out of Latin into English the
Suffrages, Prayers, Let any Collects, etc. (leaving out some of the gross
points therein) keeping still the old fashion of Psalms, Chapters, Pistles,
Gospell^ versicles, respondes, also T^ Deum, Bened^^tus, Magnificat, Nunc
dimittis, Our Father Lord have mercy upon us, The Lord be wi^ you, O Lord open
th^w my lyps, Glory to God ^ high, Lift up your hearts, O come let us reioyc^
Glory be to the Father, Quicunque vult, and^ These do they read daily morninge
an^ evening all the year long in their priest^ vestures, Surplice, cope, etc.
some the^ say, and some they sing, having in the Cathedral Churches, the
Organs, Quer^^ters, singing men and boys, as in times pa^ in pope^y. Some of
them in certain English books set forth, have reckned above 100. popish
corruptions yet retained in this Church.
Many popish errors yet remayn in that book, which their own preacher have
noted, and found fault with. There a^ they prescribed what prayers to read ov^
the dead, over the co^n and grass, some time in the year. By it are they
enjoined ^ keep their holy days to their Lady (^ they call her) to all Saints
and Angel^ to all Christ's Apostles, (except Paul a^ Barnabas) whose eyes they
are co^mande^ to fast, as also their Lent and Ember day^ besides frydayes and
saturdayes through out the whole year. By this book are t^^ Ministers
instructed how to marry, wi^ the sign of the Ring, etc. to baptize the
hallowed Font, with sign of (...) cross, with Godfathers and Godmothers,
asking the child whether it will forsake the devil and all his works, etc. to
minister also their other sacrament or communion to the people kneling, as when
in popery they received their maker, the words of Christ's institution altered,
and others in stead of them taken out of the popes portuis, with innumerable
such like enormities and fopperies wherewith it swarmeth. And this is all the
worship and service which many parishes have usually, except peradventure some
written Homilies which the unlearned Priests read unto them. This service must
first be read, and has the preeminence, even on the Lords days, before any
preaching, yea before the Bible it self. He that can read this book^
distinctly, is fit enough with them to be a Priest, yea many that have been
Artificers, as Shoemakers, Taylers, Weavers, Porters, etc, and without any
gifts or knowledge at all, save only to read English, have been and are
admitted, and to this day maynteyned by the Prelates in the Ministry.

To these Churches Ministers and Service must all the people there come every
day, yea though they have in the next parish a Preacher, and in their own a
dumb unlearned Priest, yet are they all tied to their own Church and Minister,
and must at the least twice a year, receve the Sacrament at his hands. If they
refuse this, or do not ordinarily come to their parish Church, the^ are they
su^moned, excommunicated, and imprisoned till they become obedient* In this
bondage are our countrymen there held under their Priests and Prelates: and such
as by the word of God witness against and condemn these abominations, they
hate, punish, put to death, and persecute out of the Land.

Who now in whom any spark of true light is. cannot plainly perceive this their
Ministry worship and Church to be false and adulterate? Does Christ's eternal
testament ordeyn and approve of such popish Lords and Prelates to reign over
his Church? Are these, those Christian Bishops that is Romans 12. 1. Cor. 12.
Ephesians. 4. 11. 12 13.
Pastors, Teachers, and Elders, which he has set in his Church and over his
own people unto the end of the world? Or can those Preachers which are thus
created and deposed by, thus sworn and obedient unto their spiritual Lords,
be deemed true Teachers of the Gospel of Christ lawfully called and ordained
to that Ministerye? Is that their English Mass the Ioh. 4. 24. Mat. 15. 9.
true and spiritual worship of God according to his own will? We are taught in
the scriptures Deuteronomy. 6. 4. 5 Mat. 16. 6. ^ Cor. 6. 14. 15. Psalm. 106. 34. 35.
36.
that there can be no agreement made betwixt Christ and Antichrist, betwixt the
Laws of God and men's traditions; that the servants of Jesus may not submitt
unto or receive the mark of that Beast, neither drink of the cup of the whore
of Babylons fornications, or buy any of her wares; but must Iudo. verse. 3.
contend for the mayntenance of that says which was once gyven unto the
saints, keeping their souls and bodies pure from Antichristian pollutions,
touching 2 Cor. 6. 17. Ephesians. 5. 11.
no unclean thing, nor having any fellowship with the unfruitful works of
darkness, least Rev. 18. 4. and 14. 10, 11.
by partaking with their sins they receve also of their plagues, and drynck
of the wine of the wrath of God, and be tormented in fire and brimstone, before
the holy Angels and before the Lamb for evermore. If Christ be God, let us
follow him: but if the Pope be God, what shall we say? Why have we left him,
his Church and ministry, his worship and jurisdiction, or what halting and
mocking with the Lord is this, Mat. 6. 24.
to put away the Popes person, 2 Kin. 16. 10, 11, 12. Rev^l. 13. 12. 14. 15.
and reteyne his Prelacy and Ministry, his Laws, Traditions and Canons, his
worship and service: or at the least to frame unto our selves a worship
Ministry and Church after the pattern and mould of the Apostasy of Rome?
which what other thing is it, then to make an Image of that wild beast, and
force men to worship it?

Thus see thou briefly (good Christian Reader) the things which we mislike
in the Church of England, and for which we have separated our selves as God
commands. (...). 51. 6. Mi^ 2. 10. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 17.
To all these, if we were amongst them, should we be forced to submitt our
bodies and souls, or else suffer violence at the hands of the Prelates, (...).
40.
and end our lives by violent death or most miserable imprisonment, as many of
our brethren before us have done. For so great is the malice and power of those
Romysh Priests, that they persecute unto death such as speak against them: and
such poor Christians as they cast into their noisome prysons, can seldom or
never get out (except with shipwreck of conscience) until they be carried forth
upon the Bear. Neither is there any care taken for their relief in this case:
but being cast into prison, there they are deteyned without any alloweance of
meat or money for their mayntenance, be their want and poverty never so great.
If they have any thing of their own, there they are driven to spend it up: if
they have nothing, there they are left by the Prelates to feed on the air. And
that they may more readily be sterved, or weakened in the truth, they are
commonly shut up in close prison, their friends and acquayntance being not
suffered to come at them: Nay even their wives and children being kept and
debarred from them by the tyranny of these bloody Prelates and their
Instruments: whose hard hearts and unnatural cruelty, if thou did
understand (gentle Reader) as many of us have felt and to this day yet feel, it
would make thy heart to bleed, considering their unmercifully and barbarous
dealing. And how many souls have perished in their prisons through miserable
usage, how many have been put to death, and how many banished, though we could
to their eternal infamy relate to all the world, yet will we not blaze abroad
their acts (for we take no delight in laying open their shame) but mourn for
them in secret, committing our cause to God that judges justly, knowing that
he that makes inquisition for blood remembers it, Psalm. 9. 12.
and will not forget the complaint of the poor. And thou (Christian Reader)
vouch safe to remember unto God in thy prayers such as yet remain in bands
and prison amongst them for the testimony of Jesus, Heb. 13. 3.
enduring a hard sight of afflictions, and having the sentence of death in them
selves, are like (if the Lord send not unexpected deliverance) there to end
their days.

Concerning our selves, who through the mercy of God have found a place of rest
in this land, for which benefyt we are always and every where humbly
thankful: we desire (Christian Reader) thy charitable and Christian opinion of
and holy prayers unto God for us, whose kingdom we seek, whose ordinances we
desire to establish and obey: protesting with good consciences, that it is the
truth of his Gospel only for which we strive against those cursed relics of
Antichristian apostasy: unto which we dare in no wise submit our selves, no
not for a moment. For if it be not lawful for Christians at this day to reteyn
the ceremonies of Moses Law together with the Gospel, as the Passover,
Circumcision, the Priesthood, Sacrifices, etc. Gal. 4. 4. 5. 6. and. 5. 1. 2.
Heb. 8. and 9. and 10. chap.
which yet were once commanded by God himself: how can we think it tolerable
to observe the odious ceremonies of Antichrist, or submit our selves to his
laws, Priesthood, Hierarchy, and traditions, which the Lord never allowed,
and which never entered into his heart: yea which he has so severely forbidden,
with fearful judgments threatened unto all that shall so do.

But because we have been very grievously slaundred in our own nation, and the
bruit thereoff has followed us unto this land, whereby we have been hardly
deemed of by many without cause, we have been forced at length to publysh this
brief but true Confession of our faith, for the clearing of our selves from
sclaunder, and satisfying of many who desired to know the things we hold.
Wherein if in any thing we err (as who is so perfect that he erreth not) we
crave (good Reader) thy Christian brotherly censure and information, promising
always (through the grace of God) to yield unto the truth when it shall be
further showed us, and leave our errors when by the light of his word they
shall be reproved. In like manner it shall be thy part and duty to acknowledge
and submytt unto the truth, by whomsoever it is professed, looking always
rather to the preciousnes of the treasure it self then to the baseness of the
vessels which conteyne it, 2. Cor. 4. ^
or the infirmities of those that witness the same: in whose mortal bodies thou
shall see nothing but the marks and dying of our Lord Jesus Christ. Iam. 2. ^.
But hold not thy faith in respect of men's persons, neither be thou moved at
the evyl reports which have been raised of us. Here have thou the true sum of
our Christian says: try al things by the true light of Gods word: and if thou
shall reap any profit by these our labors, give God the glory, and remember us
unto him in thy prayers. Farewell in Christ Jesus.

Eva, then Adam being seduced, did wittingly and willingly fall into
disobedience and transgression of the commandment of God. For the which, Romans

death came upon all, and reigns over al: yea even Romans 5. 14. and 9. 11.
over infants also, which have not sinned after the like manner of the
transgression of Adam, that is, actually: Hence also it is, that all since the
fall of Adam, are begotten Genesis 5. 3. and 6 5. Psalm. 51. 5. Ephesians. 2. 3. Romans 5.

in his own likeness after his image, being conceived and formed in iniquity,
and so by nature children of wrath and servants of sin, and subject to death,
and all other calamities due unto sin, in this world and for ever.

V.
Al mankind being thus fallen and become altogether dead in sin, and subject
to the eternal wrath of God, both by original and actual corruption: Yet Genesis

2 Timothy 1. 9. Phil. 3. 8. -- 11,
the elect, al and only, are redeemed, quickened, raised up and saved again,
not of themselves, neither by works (least any man should boast himself) but
wholly and only by God, of his free grace and mercy; through faith in Christ
Jesus, 1 Cor. 1. 30. 31. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Ier. 23. 5. 6. and 9. 23. 24.
who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
redemption, that according as it is written, He that rejoices should rejoice
in the Lord.

VI.
This therefore is Ioh. 17. 3. Heb. 5. 9. Ier. 23. 5. 6.
life eternal, to know the only true God, and whom he has sent into the world
Jesus Christ. And on the contrary, the 2 These. 1. 8. John. 3. 36. Zep. 1. 4. 5.
6. Romans 2. 8. 9.
Lord will render vengeance in flaming fire unto them that know not God, and
which obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

VII.
Now the rule of this knowledge faith and obedience, concerning the worship and
service of God and all other christian duties, is not men's opinions, devises,
laws, constitutions, or traditions unwritten whatsoever, but only the written
word of God, contained in the Canonical books of the old and new Testament.

In this written word, God has plainly reveled whatsoever he thought needful
for us to know beleev and acknowledge, touching the person and Office of Jesus
Christ; in who^ all the promises of God are Yea, and in whom they are Amen, to
the praise of God through us.

Cor. 3. 5. 22. and 12. 20. and 14. 33.
best help they can hereunto, and the most meet member they have to pronounce
the same in their public assembly.

XXV,
Every member^ of each Christian congregation, how excellent, great, or learned
soever, ought to be subject to this censure and judgment of Christ: Yet ought
not the Church without great care and due advise to proced against such public
persons.

for the keeping of this Church in holy and orderly communion, placed some
special men over the Church, who by their office are to govern, oversee,

likewise for the better keeping thereof in all places, by all the members, he
has given authority and laid duty upon them all to watch one over another.

XXVII.
Finally, whilst the Ministers and people thus remain together in this holy
order and Christian communion, each one endevoring to do the will of God in their
calling, and thus to walk to the glory of God, in the obedience of faith:
Christ has promised to be present with them, to bless and defend them against
all fraud and force of their enemies, so as the gates of hell shall not
prevail against the^. Mat. 28. 20. Luk 12. 35. 36. 37. 38. Romans 16. 19 20.

XXVIII.
But when and where this holy order and diligent watch was intermitted,
neglected, violated: Antichrist that man of sin, did together with other
points of Christian faith corrupt also and alter the holy ordinances, offices,
and administrations of the Church: and in stead thereof brought in, and erected
a strange new forged ministry, Leitourgie, and government. Yea and the
nations kingdoms and inhabitants of the earth were made drunken with this cup
of fornications and abominations, and al people enforced to receive the Beasts
mark and worship his image, and so brought into confusion and Babylonish
bondage.

they use for Plurality of benefices, licenses of Non residency, Licenses to
mary and eat flesh (both which with them are on certain days and times
forbidden, etc,) These, we say, are sufficient proofs of the former assertion,
the particulars therein being duly examined by and compared to the rules of
Christ's Testament. Not to speak here, of their private Baptism, of the sign
of the Cross used in Baptism, of questions propounded to the infants, of the

These Ecclesiastical Assemblies, remaining thus in confusion and bondage under
this Antichristian Ministry, Courts, Canons, worship, Ordinances etc. without
freedom and power to redress any enormitie among them, cannot be said in this
confusion and subjection, truly to have Christ their Prophet Priest and King,

Thus being rightly gathered, established, and still proceeding in Christian
communion and obedience of the Gospel of Christ, none is to separate for
faults and corruptions, which may and so long as the Church consists of
mortal men will fall out and arise among them, even in true constituted
Churches, but by due order to seek redres^e thereof.

And although the particular Congregations be thus distinct and several

walk by one and the same rule, and by all means convenient to have the
counsel and help one of another in all needful affairs of the Church, as

And if God incline the Magigstrates hearts to the allowance and protection of
the Church therein, it ought to be accounted a singular and happy blessing of
God who gra^teth such noursing Fathers and Mothers to his Church. And it

our selves to have always a clear conscience toward God and toward men: And
having hope in God that the resurrection of the dead shall be of the just unto
life, and of the unjust unto condemnation, everlasting. Now if any take this to
be heresy, then do we with the Apostle freely confess that after the way
which they call heresy, we worship God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
believing all things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets and
Apostles: and whatsoever is according to this rule of truth published in our
own country or holden by any reformed Churches in their Confessions abroad in
the world. We do also reject and detest all strange and heretical opinions and
doctrines of all Heretics both old and new whatsoever. Mat, 22, 21. Act 24.

Finally, whereas we are much slaundered and traduced as if we denied or
misliked that form of prayer commonly called the Lords prayer: we thought it
needful here also concerning it to make known, that we beleev and acknowledge it
to be a most absolute and most excellent form of prayer, such as no men nor
Angels can set down the like. And that it was taught and appointed by our Lord
Jesus Christ, not that we should be tied to the use of those very words, but
that we should according to that rule make all our requests and thankesgiving
unto God, forasmuch as it is a perfect form and pattern, containing in it
plain and sufficient directions of prayer, for all occasions and necessities,
that have been, are, or shall be, to the Church of God, or any member thereof, to
the end of the world. Mat. 6. 9-13. Luke 11. 2. 3. 4. with Mat. 14 30. and 26.

Now unto him that is able to keep us that woe fall (...) and to present us
faultlesse before the presence of his glory with joy, that is, to God only
wise, our Savior, be glory and majesty, and dominion, and power, both now
(...) for ever, Amen.

The heads of the differences between us and the Church of England as it
stands at this day, concerning diverse corruptions of Antichrist yet remaining
among them.
I.
THat Christ the Lord has by his last Testament given to his Church, and set
therein, sufficient ordinary Offices, with the manner of calling or Entrance,
Works, and Maintenance, for the administration of his holy things, and for the
sufficient ordinary instruction guydance and service of his Church, to the end
of the world.

2. That every particular Church has like and full interest and power to enjoy
and practice all the ordinances of Christ given by him to his Church to be
observed therein perpetually.

3. That a true visible Church, is a company of people called and separated
from the world by the word of God, and joined together by voluntary profession
of the faith of Christ, in the fellowship of the Gospel. And that therefore no
profane persons, unbelievers or wicked livers, may be received retained or
c^^pelled to be members in the Church of Christ, which is his body; God having
in all ages appointed and made a separation of his people from the world,
before the Law, under the Law, and now in the time of the Gospel.

4. That discreet, faithful, and able men (though not yet in office of
Ministry) may preach the Gospel and whole truth of God, that men being first
brought to knowledge, and converted to the Lord, may then be joined together in
holy comunion with Christ our head and one with another.

5. That being thus joined, every Church has power in Christ to choose and take
unto themselves meet and sufficient persons, into the Offices and functions of
Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons and Helpers, as those which Christ has
appointed in his Testament, for the feeding, governing, serving, and building
up of his Church. And that no Antichristian Hierarchy or ministry, of Popes.
Archbishops, Lord bishops, Suffraganes, Deanes, Archdeacons, Chauncellors,
Parsons, Vicars, Priests, Dumb-ministers, or any such like, may be set over the
Spouse and Church of Christ, nor retained therein.

6. That the Ministers aforesaid being lawfully called by the Church where they
are to administer, ought to continue in their functions according to Gods
ordinance, and carefully to f^ed the flock of Christ committed unto them, being
not enjoined or suffered to bear Civil offices withal, neither burdened with
the execution of Civil affairs, as the celebration of marriage, bu^ying the
dead etc. which things belong as well to those without as within the Church.

7. That the due maintenance of the Officers aforesaid, should be of the free
and voluntary contribution of the Church, that according to Christ's ordinance,
they which preach the Gospel may live of the Gospel: and not by Popish
Lordships and livings, or Jewish Tithes and Offerings. And that therefore the
Lands and other like revenewes of the Prelates and Clergy yet remaining (being
still also baits to allure the Jesuits and Seminaries into the Land, and
incitements unto them to plot and prosecute their woonted evil courses, in hope
to enjoy them in time to come) may and ought to be taken away, and converted to
better use, as those of the Abbeyes and Nunneries have been heretofore by the
Princes power and authority, to the honor of God and great good of the Rea^lme.

8. That al particular Churches ought to be so constituted, as having their own
peculiar Officers, the whole body of every Church may meet together in one
place, and jointly perform their duties to God and one toward another. And
that the censures of admonition and excommunication should in due manner be
executed, for sin, convicted, and obstinatly stood in. This power also to be
in the body of the Church whereof the parties so offending and persisting are
members.

9. That the Church is not to be governed by Popish Canons, Courts, Classes,
Customs, or any humane inventions, but by the Laws and rules which Christ
has appointed in his Testament. That no Apocrypha writings, but only the
Ca^nical scriptures are to be used in the Church. And that the Lord is to be
worshipped and called upon in spirit and truth, according to that form of
prayer given by the Lord Jesus, Mat. 6. and after the Leitourgie of his own
Testament, not by any other framed or imposed by men, much less by one
translated from the Popish (...), as the Book of common prayer etc.

10. That the Sacraments, being seals of Gods covenant, ought to be
administered only to the faithful, and Baptism to their seed or those under
their government. And that according to the simplicity of the Gospel, without
any Popish or other abuses, in either Sacrament.

11. That the Church is not to be urged to the observation of days and times,
Jewish or Popish, save only to sanctify the Lords day: Neither to be laden in
things indifferent, with rites and ceremonies, Whatsoever invented by men; but
that christian liberty may be rete^ned: And what God has left f^ee, none to
make bound.

12. That al monuments of Idolatry in garments or any other things, al Temples,
Altars, Chapels, and other places dedicated heertofore by the Heathens or
Antichristians to their fa(...) worship, ought by authority to be rased and
bolished, not suffered to remain, for nourishing superstition, much less
employed to the tr(...) worship of God.

13. That Popish degrees in Theology, i(...) forcement to single life in
Colleges, abuse the study of profane heathen Writers, w(...) other like
corruptions in Schools and Academi(...) should be removed and redressed, that
so th(...) may be the welsprings and (...) series of true lea^ning and godliness.

14. Finally that all Churches and peop^^ (without exception) are bound in
Religion on(...)ly to receive and submit unto that constitution Ministry,
Worship, and order, which Christ Lord and King has appovnted unto his Church
and not to any other devised by Man whatsoeve^^

Let him that reads, consider.
