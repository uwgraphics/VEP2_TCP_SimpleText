BY THE LORD DEPVTIE AND COUNCIL. HENRY FALKLAND.
WHereas for prevention of such disorders, ryots and rebellions within this
Realm, as might grow by loose and disloyal people, having means to arm
themselves, to do mischief against his Majesty and the Common wealth, diverse
Proclamations have been heretofore published by the late Lo: Deputies and
Council of this Kingdom, commanding that no Master or owner of any Ship,
Barque, or any Merchant, Factor, or other Tradseman, nor any other person or
persons whatsoever, denizen or stranger, should bring or cause to be brought
into this Kingdom or any part thereof, without special license from the Lords
of the Council in England, or from the Lord Deputy and Council here, any
quantity or quantities of Gunpowder, or any Muskets, Calliuers, Hand-gunns,
Pistols, or other Pieces, Morrions, Head-peeces, Armors, or any other furniture
for the wars (Swords and Rapiers, and Sword and Rapier blades only excepted)
upon pain of his Majesty's displeasure and indignation, and upon p^ine of
se^sure and so, feyture of the same, whereof the one moytie to be to the use of
the Kings most excellent Majesty, and the other moytie to the use of such
person or persons as should so discover and seize the same to his Majesty's
use. And We being now again informed that the said Proclamations have of late
been little regarded, but that great quantities of Powder, Arms, and other
warlike munition of all kinds have been daily brought into this Kingdom from
foreign parts, and sale thereof made to all sorts of people, without respect
of persons, so as many loose ^earnes, and idle persons of bad and lewd
behavior, being furnished and armed with powder, pieces and other warlike
weapons, do not only make great spoil and havoc of red and fallow Dear,
and other game within the proper lands of sundry Noblemen and Gentlemen of
this kingdom, but are thereby the rather imboldned to commit diverse insolent
ryots, burglaries, robberies and murders, and many times to run into open
action of rebellion, to the great disturbance of the public peace and trouble
of the State and Commonwealth of this Kingdom: By means whereof, greater
mischiefs and inconveniences may happen in this Realm, if due care and
circumspection be not speedily had for preventing the same. And although after
so many warnings given, We may justly call such persons to account as have
offended against the said Proclamations, by imposing the utmost penalty that
by the Tenor of the same might be inflicted upon them for their wilful
contempt against his Majesty and the State in that behalf: Yet hoping that by
the renewing of the said former Proclamations once more, the same will from
henceforth be more strictly observed and kept then heretofore it has been, We
therefore do again in the name of the Kings most excellent Majesty, declare,
publish, and command, That no Master or owner of any Ship or Barque, or any
Merchant, Factor, or other tradesman, nor any other person or persons
whatsoever, denizen or stranger, shall from henceforth bring or cause to be
brought into this Kingdom, or any part thereof, (without special license from
the Lords of the Council in England, or from Us the Lord Deputy and Council
of this kingdom) any quantity or quantities of Gunpowder, or any Muskets,
Caliuers, Handguns, Pistols, or other Pieces, Murrions, Head-peeces, Armours,
or other furniture for the Wars (Swords and Rapiers, and Sword and Rapier
blades only excepted) upon pain of his Majesty's displeasure and indignation,
and upon pain of seysure and forfeyture of the same, whereof the one moytie
shall be to the use of the Kings Majesty, and the one half of the other
moytie to be for the Officer of his Majesty's Store, where the same be seized,
and the other moytie, and half of the aforesaid moytie, to be given to him who
shall discover and seize the same, or the value thereof, according to his
Majesty's rates. And We do further in his Majesty's name declare and publish,
That if any merchant, factor, or tradesman, or any other person or persons
within this Realm, now have or at any time hereafter shall happen to have any
quantity or quantities of Gunpowder, or any Muskets, Caliuers, handguns, or
other Pieces, Murrions, head-peeces, Armor, or other abiliments of war
(Swords and Rapiers, and Sword and Rapier blades excepted) in his or their
hands or possession, to the intent to sell the same or any part thereof to any
person or persons, that then such merchant, factor, or other person or persons,
within one month after the date of this Proclamation, or within one month
after the said powder or munition; shall come to his or their hands shall upon
pain of seizure, and forfeiture thereof, and upon pain of his Majesty's
displeasure and indignation, bring or cause to be brought all such powder, and
other munition, into one of his Majesty's Stores of Ordinance and munition,
whereupon We the Lord Deputy and Council shall from time to time take order,
and provide that the Officers of his Majesty's Ordinance and munition shall
receive the same, and the Owner or Owners thereof immediately upon the
delivery thereof into his Majesty's Store, be fully satisfied and pa^ed for
the same, at such rates and prices, as the Master of the Ordnance has usually
issued the same. Provided always that it shall and may be lawful to and for
every City or Town corporate within this Realm, to retain and keep within
their several Stores, such powder or munition for the necessary defense of
the said Cities and Towns Corporate, so as the said corporations do within
forty days after the date hereof, certify Us the Lord Deputy and Council,
what quantity or quantities of powder or other munition they and every of them
have now in their Stores, and so as they nor any of them do not issue the same
nor any part thereof by way of sale. And We do further declare and publish.
That if any Nobleman, Gentleman, or person of honest and good behavior, or if
any City or Corporation, or any Owner or master of Barque or Ship going to
Sea, shall have occasion to use any reasonable quantity of powder, or any
muskets, Calliuers, or other furniture of War, That every such person and
persons, and every such City, Town or corporation, shall be from time to time,
by the warrant of the Lord Deputy, or by the warrant of the several
Presidents of the provinces of Munster and Connaght, or of other Commanders or
governors within their several commands, furnished and supplied of any such
competent quantity of powder or munition as he or they shall desire to use, at
such reasonable and easy rates as his Majesty does usually issue the same to
his Army within this land. And We do hereby expressly charge and command all
and every governor and governors, Mayors, Sovereigns, Portriffes, Bayliffes,
Constables, and all Custo^ers, Searchers, and Councellers, within all and every
the Ports, Havens and Creekes of this Realm, and all other his Majesty's
Officers and ministers to whom it may appertain, That they and every of them
do from time to time use and employ their best diligence and endeavors to
discover and leise to his Majesty's use as aforesaid, such quantities of
powder, muskets, Calliuers, hand guns, Pieces, and other munition and furniture
of war, as shall be brought into this Kingdom or any part thereof, to be
sold to any person or persons, or which any merchant, factor, or other person
or persons shall deteyne and keept in his hands or possession, to the intent to
sell the same, contrary to the purport of this Proclamation, and that herein
they fail not to perform their duties, as they will answer the contrary at
their perils. Provided always, that it shall not be lawful for any person or
persons whatsoever, wearing any Irish ma^tle or Trowses, to use, carry or
keep any musket, Calliuer, hand-gun, Pistol, or other Piece or Pieces, nor to
have or use any gunpowder, nor to wear, carry or keep any murrion, head
piece, Swords, Rapiers, Skeynes, or any other arms whatsoever inuasiue or
defensive, upon pain to forfeyt the same to his Majesty. And that it shall be
lawful for every Nobleman, Gentleman, or other person of honest and good
behavior, conforming him or themselves unto the English fashion of apparel,
to seize and take away the same, and the same so seized and taken away, to
carry to the next Justice of the peace, to the intent the same may be
delivered into his Majesty's next magazin or Storehouse of the munition and
armor in those parts, or to such person or persons as shall have oversight or
command of the same.

And whereas many times heretofore instructions have been given, as well to the
Lords Presidents in the several Provinces, as to the Justices of Assize in
their several circuites and sessions, for abolishing the use of Irish
apparel, and the reducing of all men to use a civil and comely attire,
according to the Laws and Statutes of this kingdom: Yet although they have
(according to the said instructions) endeavored to take away the barbarous
custom of wearing Mantles, Trowses, Skeynes, and such like uncivil and
uncomely apparel, We see notwithstanding the use of them rather increased then
any ways reformed or abated, even to this day, to the great contempt of
authority, and the disgrace of this kingdom among other civil nations. For
reformation whereof, We have thought fit hereby once more to give all men
notice, that as his Majesty has often recommended the care of the redress of
the said barbarous custom unto Us, and abolishing the use of such unseemly
apparel, so now W^ intend to inflict the utmost penalty of law upon such as
from and after the time hereby prescribed shall presume either to wear the
said barbarous attire, or to suffer any within their family or rule to wear
and use the same, contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, And do
therefore hereby straightly charge and command, That from and after the first
day of August next no Man do wear any Mantle, Trowses, or long Skeynes, nor
do suffer any to be worn by any within his family, government or rule but by
the time aforesaid do attire themselves, their children, servants, and
followers in such comely manner as the ciuillest subjects of this kingdom now
use to do: In default whereof, they are to expect no favor, but to be
proceeded against for their wilful and obstinate contempt in the seuerest
manner that by the Laws and Statutes of this kingdom may be taken against
them, and besides such other punishments to be inflicted upon them, as the Law
does impose. We hereby charge and command, That no person which from and after
the time aforesaid, shall wear or use any Irish apparel or weapon shall
presume to come, nor shall be admitted to have access or audience to or at the
Council table, or in any Court of Justice in this kingdom, nor before any
Judge or Magistrate, upon any matter or cause of private complaint whatsoever.
And We do likewise hereby straightly command all Sheriffs, Prouosts,
marshals, and other Officers, that as they shall find any man that after the
said day shall wear any such long Skeyne, to take the same and break them,
And such men as they shall find wearing of Mantles or Trowses out of their
own houses, to take the same from them, and before their faces to cut them
into pieces, that they never be worn again. Of the erecution whereof, We
require the said Sheriffs and prouost-marshals, and other his Majesty's
Officers, to be very careful, as they will answer the contrary and their
neglect or remissness therein. Provided always, that it shall and may be
lawful to or for any person or persons to use or wear any Mantle within his
or their houses, notwithstanding any thing in this Proclamation, to the
contrary.
