A devout treatise upon the Pater noster / made first in latin by the most
famous doctor master Erasmus Roterodamus / and turned in to englisshe by a
young virtuous and well learned gentylwoman of.xix. year of age.





Richard Hyrde / unto the most studyous and virtuous young maid Fraunces. S.
sends gretynge and well to fare.
I Have herd many men put great dout^ whether it should be expedyent and
requisite or not / a woman to have lernyng in books of latin and greek. And
some utterly affirm that it is not only / another necessary nor profitable /
but also very noisome and ieoperdous: Allegyng for their opinion that the
frail kind of women / being enclyned of their own courage unto vice / and
mutable at every newelty / if they should have skyll in many things / that be
written in the latin and greek tongue / compiled and made with great craft and
eloquence / where the matter is happily sometime more sweet unto the ear / than
wholesome for ye mind / it would of lykelyhode / both inflame their stomakes a
great deal the more / to that vice / that men say they be to much given unto
of their own nature already / and enstructe them also with more subtilyte and
conueyaunce / to set forward and acco^plysshe their froward entente and
purpose. But these men that so say / do in my judgment / either regard but
little what they speak in this matter / or else / as they be for ye more part
unlearned / they envy it / and take it sore to heart / that other should have yt
precious jewel / which they another have them self / nor can find in their
hertes to take the pain to get. For first / where they reken such
instabilite and mutable nature in women / they say therein their pleasure of a
contensyous mind / for the mayntenaunce of their matter / for if they would
look thereon with one even eye / and co^sydre the matter equally / they should
find and well perceive / that women be not only of no less constancy and
discrecion than men / but also more steadfast and sure to trust unto / than
they.

For whether I pray you was more light and more to be disco^mended / Helen
that with much labor and suit / and many craftye means / was at the last
overcome and enticed to go away with the kings son of Troy? Or Paris /
which with ones sight of her / was so doted in her love / that neither the
great chere and kyndenesse showed unto him of her husband king Menelaus / nor
shame of the abomynable deed / nor fear of the peril that was like to come
thereupon / nor the dread of god / might let him to convey her away / contrary
to all gentylnesse / contrary to all right / all laws and conscience? Nor the
woman casts her mind neither to one nor other of her own proper will /
Which thing is a sure token of an vpryght and a steadfast mind / but by the
suit and means of the man: When he with one look of her / is rauisshed of all
his wits. Now if here parauenture a man would say / yes / they be moved
as well as men / but they dissemble / forbear / and will not utter their
stomakes / another it is so co^uenyent the woman to speak as the man: that shall
not help his excuse / but rather hyndre it / for they be the more worthy to be
allowed / that will not be so far ouersene in that affection / which is so
naturally given to all things living / but that they can remember their duty
and honesty / where the man is many times so far beside his reason / yt he
sees another where nor wha^ / another to whom / nor how to behave him self /
another can regard / what is comely and what is not. For verily / it is as
vnco^uenient for the man to demand that thing that is unlawful / if he
could perceive / as for the woman. And if both their vices were all open and
showed / the man should have much more that he ought to be ashamed of / saving
that he is also in that point worse than the woman / in as much as she is a
shamed of her fault / be it never so small: and he is so far from that virtue
/ yt when he has done naught / he reioyseth of it and auau^ceth himself / as
though it were well done. And yet he is so unreasonable in iugyng the woman /
that as Isocrates says wherein he has no consyderation / how often or how
sore he offend his wife: He will not suffer ones to be offended him self by
her never so little: where he would that she should take his deeds all well in
worth. Wherefore in deed / women be in gaye case and happy / if their honesty
and praise must hang at the gyrdelles of such people. Now as for lernyng /
if it were cause of any yuell as they say it is / it were worse in the man than
in the woman / because (as I have said here before) he can both worse stay
and refrain him self / than she. And moreover than that / he comes ofter and
in mo occasyons thau^e the woman / in as much / as he lives more forth
abroad among company daily / where he shall be moved to utter such craft as he
has gotten by his learning. And women abide most at home / occupied ever with
some good or necessary business. And the latin and the greek tongue / I se not
but there is as little hurt in them / as in books of Englisshe and french /
which men both read them self / for the proper pastymes that be written in
them / and for the witty and crafty conueyaunce of the makynges: And also can
bear well enough / that women read them if they will / never so much /
which co^moditeis be far better handeled in the latin and greek / than any
other la^gage: and in them be many holy doctors writings / so devout and
effectuous / that who soever redeth them / must needs be either much better
or less yuell / which every good body both man and woman will read and
follow / rather than other. But as for that / that I here many men ley for the
greattest ieoperdy in this matter / in good faith to be plain me think it is
so folysshe / yt scantly it is worthy / either to be rehearsed or answered unto.
That is / where they say / if their wives could Latin or greek / than might
they talk more boldly with priests and freres / as who says / there were no
better means (if they were ill dysposed) to execute their purposes / than by
speaking Latin or greek / outher else / that priests and freres were commonly
so well learned / that they can make their bargeyne in latin and greek so redily
/ which thing is also far contrary / yt I suppose now a days a man could
not deuyse a better way to keep his wife safe from them / than if he teache her
the latin and greek tongue / and such good sciences as are written in them: the
which now most part of priests / and specially such as be naught / abhor
and fly from: ye / as fast in a manner / as they fly from beggars / that ask
them alms in the street. And where they find fault with lernyng / because
they say / it engenders wit and craft / there they reprehende it / for that
that it is most worthy to be commended for / and the which is one singular
cause wherefore lernyng ought to be desired / for he that had lever have his
wife a fool than a wise woman / I hold him worse than twyse frantyke. Also /
redyng and studyeng of books so occupies the mind / that it can have no
leyser to muse or delight in other fantasies / wha^ in all handy works / that
men say be more mete for a woman / the body may be busy in one place / and the
mind walkyng in another: and while they sit sowing and spinnyng with their
fyngers / may ^aste and compass many peuysshe fantasyes in their minds /
which must needs be occupied / outher with good or badde / so long as they be
waking. And those y^ be yuell disposed / will find the means to be naught /
though they can never a letter on the book / and she that will be good /
learning / shall cause her to be much the better. For it shows the image and
ways of good living / even right as a myrrour shows the symylitude and
proporcion of the body. And doutlesse / the daily experyence prouethe / that
such as are naught / are those that never knew what lernyng meant. For I never
herd tell / nor reed of any woman well learned / that ever was (as plentuous as
yuell tongues be) spotted or infamed as vicious. But on the otherside / many by
their lernyng taken such encreace of goodness / yt many may bear them
witness of their virtue / of which sort I could rehearse a great nombre /
both of old time and late / Saving that I will be content as for now /
with one example of our own country and time / that is: this gentylwoman /
which translated this little book herafter following: whose virtuous
co^uersacion / living / and sad demeanoure / may be proof euydente enough /
what good learning does / where it is surely roted: of whom other women may
take example of prudent / humble / and wifely behauour / charitable and very
christian virtue / with which she has with gods help endeavored her self /
no less to garnisshe her soul / than it has lyked his goodness with lovely
beauty and comeliness / to garnysshe and set out her body: And undoubted is
it / that to thyncrease of her virtue / she has taken and takes no little
occasyon of her lernyng / besides her other manyfolde and great co^modyteis
taken of the same / among which co^modyteis this is not the leest / that with
her virtuous / worshipful / wise / and well learned husband / she has by the
occasyon of her learning / and his delight therein / such especial conforte /
pleasure / and pastyme / as were not well possible for one unlearned couple /
either to take together or to conceive in their minds / what pleasure is
therein. Therefore good Fraunces / seeing that such fruit / profit and pleasure
comes of lernyng / take uo head unto the leude words of those that dispreyse
it / as verily no man does / save such as neither have lernyng / nor wotteth
what it means / which is in deed the most part of men / and as the most
part and the best part be not always of one my^de / so if this matter should
be tried / not by wit and reason / but by heedes or hands / the greater
part is like as it often does / to vanquisshe and overcome the better / for
the best perte (as I reken) whom I account the wysest of every age / as among
the Gentyls the old philosophers / and among the christe^men / the ancient
doctors of Christ's church / all affirm lerny^g to be very good and
profitable / not only for men but also for women / ye which Plato the wise
philosopher calls a bridell for young people against vice. Wherefore good
Fraunces / take you the best part and leave the most / follow the wise men
and regard not the folysshe sort / but apply all your might / will / and
dilygence to obtain that especial treasure / which is delectable in youth /
comfortable in age / and profitable at all seasons: Of whom without doubt /
comes much goodness and virtue. Which virtue who so lacks / he is without
that thing that only makes a man: Ye and without the which a man is worse
than an unreasonable be / nor ones worthy to have the name of a man. It
makes fair and amyable / that that is of nature deformed: as Diogynes the
philosopher / when he saw a young man foul and yuell favored of person / but
very virtuous of lyuenge: thy virtue said he / makes the beautiful: And that
that is goodly of it self already / it makes more excellent and bright. Which
as Plato ye wise philosopher says / if it could be seen with our bodily eyes
/ it would make men wondersly enamored and taken in the love of it. Wherefore
unto those especial gifts of grace that god has lent you / and endewed you
with all / endeuer your self that this precious diamo^de and ornament be not
lackyng / which had / shall florisshe and lyghten all your other gifts of
grace / and make them more gaye: and lacked / shall dark and blemysshe them
sore. And surely the beauty of it / though ye had none other / shall get you
both greatter love / more faithful and lengar to co^tynue of all good folks
/ than shall the beauty of the body / be it never so excellent / whose love
decays together / with it yt was the cause of it / and most commonly before /
as by daily experye^ce we may se / them that go toguyder for the love of the
bodily beauty / within a small while when their appetyte is satisfied / repent
the^ self. But the love that comes by the means of virtue and goodness
shall ever be fresshe and increase / right as does the virtue it self. And it
shall you come by non otherwise so redily / as if you continue the study of
lernyng / which you be entered well in all ready: And for your time and age / I
would say / had greatly profyted / saving that chyldes age is so frail
accounted / that it needs rather monicion and co^tynuall calling upon / than
the deserved praise. How be it I have no doubt in you / whom I se naturally
borne unto virtue / and having so good bri^gyng up of a babe / not only among
your honorable uncles children / of whose conversation and company / they that
were right yuell / might take occasyon of goodness and amendment / But also
with your own mother / of whose precepts and teaching / and also very
virtuous lyueng / if you take heed / as I put no fear you will and also do /
you can not fail to come to such grace and goodness / as I have ever had
opynion in you that ye should. Wherefore I have ever in my mind favored you /
and forthered to my power your profit / and increase thereunto / and shall as
long as I se you delight in learning and virtue / no kind of pain or labor
refused on my party / that may do you good. And as a token of my good mind /
and an instrument toward your success and furtheraunce I send you this book
/ little in quantite but big in value / turned out of latin in to english
by your own forenamed kynswoman / whole goodness and virtue / two things
there be that let me much to speak of. The one / because it were a thing
superfluous to spend many words unto you about that matter / which your self
know well enough / by long experience and daily use. The other cause is / for
I would eschew the sclaundre of flatery: how be it I count it no flatery to
speak good of them that deserve it / but yet I know that she is as loathe to
have praise gyuyn her / as she is worthy to have it / and had leauer her praise
to rest in men's hertes / than in their tongues / or rather in gods
estimacion and pleasure / than any man's words or thought: and as touching
the book it self / I refer and leave it to the iugementes of those that
shall read it / and unto such as are learned / y^ only name of the maker
puts out of question / the goodness and perfectyon of the work / which as
to mine own opinyon and fantasye / can not be amended in any point: And as
for the translacion thereof / I dare be bold to say it / that who so list and
well can confer and examyne the translacyon with the original / he shall not
fail to find that she has showed her self / not only erudite and elegant
in either tongue / But has also used such wysedom / such dyscrete and
substancyall judgment in expressing lively the latin / as a man may
parauenture mysse in many things / translated and turned by them that bare ye
name of rightwise and very well learned men: and the labor that I have had
with it about the printing / I yield holly and freely give unto you / in whose
good manners and virtue / as in a child / I have so great affection / and unto
your good mother / unto whom I am so much beholden / of whose company I take
so great joy and pleasure / in whose godly communycacion I find such
spyrituall fruit and swetnesse / that as often as I talk with her / so often me
thy^ke I feel my self the better. Therefore now good Fraunces follow still on
her steps / look ever upon her life / to enfourme your own thereafter / like
as ye would look in a glass to tire your body by: ye / and that more
diligently / in so much as the beauty of the body though it be never so well
attended / will soon fade and fall away: good living and virtue ones gotten
tarieth still / whose fruit ye shall feel / not only in this world which is
transytorie and of short contynuaunce / but also in another: And also it
should be great shame dishonestye / and rebuke unto you borne of such a mother
/ and also nourysshed up with her own teate / for to degenerate and go out of
kind. Behold her in this age of hers / in this almost contynuall disease and
syckenesse / how busye she is to learn / and in the small time that she has
had / how much she has yet profited in the latin tongue / how great comfort
she takes of that learning that she has gotten / and consydre thereby what
pleasure and profit you may have here after (if god lend you life (as I
pray he do) of the lernyng that you may have or you come to her age / if you
spend your time well: which doing you shall be able to do your self good /
and be great joy and conforte to all your friends / and all that ever would
you well / among whom I would you should reken me for one / not among the
leest if not among the chief: and so fare you well / mine own good / gentle
/ and fair Fraunces.

At Chelcheth / the year of our lord god / a thousand five hundred.xxiiij.
The first day of Octobre.
Here after folowethe seuyn peticions of the Pater noster / translated out of
Latin in to English.
The first peticion.
PAter noster qui es in celis / sanctificetur nomen tuum. Here O father in
heuyn the petycions of thy children / which though they be as yet bodily in
earth / natwithstandynge / in mind ever they desire and long to come to ye
country celestial / and fathers house / where they well know and understand
/ that the treasure of everlasting welthe and felycite / that is to say / the
inherytaunce of life immortal / is ordained for them. We aknowledge thine
excellency / O maker / savior / and governor of all thing / contained in
heaven and in earth / And again we aknowledge and confess our own vileness /
and in no wise we durst be so bold to call the father (which are far
unworthy to be thy bond men) ne take upon us the most honorable name of thy
children / which uneath thou vouch sauest thine angels / except thy mere
goodness had: by adoptyon received us in to the great honor of this name.
The time was / when we were servants to wickedness and sin / by the
miserable generation of Adam: we were also children of the fend / by whose
instinction and spyrite we were driven and compelled to every kind of myschefe
and offense. But that thou of thine infinite mercy / by thine only begoten
son Jesus / made us free from the thraldom of syn^e / and delyueredest us
from the devil our father / and by violence riddest us from thinheritaunce of
eternal fire / and at the last / you vouchsaffest to adopt us by faith and
baptyme / as members in the most holy body of thy son: not only in to the
felowshyppe of thy name / but also of thine inheritance. And because we should
nothing mystrust i^ thy love toward us / as a sure token thereof / thou sendest
from heaven down in to our hertes / the most holy spyrite of thy son:
Which (all seruauntlye fears shaken of) boldly cries out in our hertes
without cessyng / Abba pater / Which in English is as much to say / as O
father father: and this thy son taught us / by whom (as mynister) thou
gyuest us all thing: That when we were as it were borne again by thy spyrite
/ and at the fo^tstone in baptyme / renounced and forsaken our father ye devil
/ and had begone to have no father in earth / than we should aknowledge only
our father celestyall: By whose marvelous power we were made somewhat of right
naught: by whose goodness we were restored / when we were lost: by whose
wisdom incomparable / evermore we are governed and kept / that we fall not
again in to destruction. This thy son gave us full trust to call upon the /
he assigned us also away of prayeng to the / aknowlege therefore the desire and
prayer of thy son / aknowlege the spirit of thy son / which prays to
thy majesty for us by us: Do you not disdain to be called father of those /
whom thy son most lykest thy image / vouchesafe to call his brethern / and
yet we ought not her upon to take lykyng in our selfs / but to give glory to
the and thy son for that great gentylnesse: sith no man can here of him
self ought deserve / but that thing whatsoever good it be / comes of thy
only and free lyberalite. Thou delytest rather in names loving and charitable
/ than terrible and fearful: Thou desyrest rather to be called a father /
thanne a lord or master: Thou would we should rather love the as thy
children / than fear the as thy servants and bond men: Thou first louedest
us / and of thy goodness also it comes / and thy reward / that we do love
the again. Give ear / O father of spyrites to thy children spyrituall /
which in spyrite pray to the: For thy son told us / that in those that so
prayed thy delight was / whom therefore you se^dest in to the world that he
should teach us all veryte and truth. Here now the desires of unity and
concord / for it is not sytting ne agreeable / that brethren who^ thy
goodnes^e has put in equal honor / should disagre or varry among themself
/ by ambicious desire of worldely promocion / by contencious debate / hatered
or envy / all we hang of one father / we all one thing pray for and desire /
no man asks ought for him self specially or a part / but as members of one
body / quyckened and releued with one soul: We require and pray in common /
for that which indyffere^tly shall be expedient and necessary for us all. And in
deed / we dare none other thing desire of the / than what thy son commanded
us / ne otherwise ask / than as he appointed us / for in so askyng / his
goodness promised we should obtain / what soever we prayed for in his name.
And for as much as when thy son was here in earth / he nothing more
fervently desired / than that thy most holy name should appear and shine / not
only in Judea / but also through all the world / beside we also / both by
his encoragyng and ensample / this one thing above all desire / that the glory
of thy most holy name / may replenisshe and fulfill both heaven and earth / so
that no creature be which dredeth not thy hye power and majesty / which do
not worship and reuere^de also thy wisdom eternal and marvelous goodness
/ for thy glory as it is great / so neither having beginning nor endyng / but
ever in it self florisshynge / can neither encreace nor decreace / but it
skylleth yet mankind not a little / yt every man it know and magnifye / for
to know and confess the only very god. And Jesus Christ whom thou fendest in
to ye world / is as much to us / as life eternal. Let the clear shynyng of
thy name / shadow and quench in us all worldly glory. Suffer no man to
presume to take upon him self any perte of glory / for glory out of yt is non
/ but very sclau^dre and rebuke. The course of nature also in carnal children
this thing causes / that they greatly desire the good fame and honest
reputacion of their father: for we may se how glad they be / and how they
rejoice / how happy also they think them self / if happen their fathers any
great honor / as goodly tryumphe / or their image and picture to be brought
in to ye court or common place with an honorable preface / or any other goodly
royalte what soever it be. And again we se how they wayle / and how aghast and
astonyed they be / if chance their fathers sclaundre or infamy. So depely has
this thing natural affection routed in man's heart / that the fathers rejoice
in their childrens glory / and their children in the glory of their fathers.
But for asmoche as ye gostly love and affection of god / far passes and
excedeth ye carnal affecion of m^: therefore we thy spiritual children / much
more fervently thurst and desire the glory and honor of thy most holy name /
and greatly are vexed and troubled in heart / if he / to whom alone all glory
is due chance rebuked or sclaundred to be / not that any sclaundre or rebuke
can mynisshe or defoule the clerenesse of thy glory / but that we / as much as
lies in us / in a manner do wrong and injury to thy name / when soever the
gentyls either not knowing / or else dispisynge the maker and original of all
/ do worship and homage to creatures most vile / as made of tymbre or stone:
or other peynted images / some also to oxe^ some to bulls / and such other
like: And moreover / in all these foul and wicked deuylles / in honor of the^
they sing hymns: to these they do sacrifyce / before these they burn ensence
and other sweet savors / than we thy spirytu^ll children / seeing all this /
doubly are agreued / both yt thou have not that honor which is due to the /
and that these wretches perisshe by their own madness and follye. The jews
also never cesse in their sinagoges and resort of people / from dispitefull
and abominable bacbytinge of thy only son / whereby in the mean time they
sclaundre the / sith it can not be chosen when thy son is misfamed (which
is ye very clerenesse of thy glory) but that infamy also must redounde in the.
They cast eke in our tethe / as a thing of great dishonestie / ye most glorious
name of thy children / saying / yt it were better to be called thieves or
manquellers / than^e christen men and folowers of Christ. They ley against us
also that thy son was crucified / which is to us great glory and renoume /
We may thank thy mercy father of all this thing that we have / and aknowledge
the as original and causer of all our health / that we worship also thy
son in egall authorite with the / and that we have received in to our hertes
the spirit of you both. But yet good father in heaven / we pray yt to show
thy mercy to those also / that both the ge^tyls leauyng and forsakyng the
worshippyng and homage of counterfaite images: may do all honor and reverence
to thy majesty alone / and the jews releued with thy spyrite / renounsing
their supersticious vsyng of the law may confess god / from whom all thing
so abundantly comes / may confess the fonne of god / by whom we receive all:
may confess the holygost / parttaker and fellow of the divine nature / Let
them worship in three persons / one and egall majesty / and aknowledge three
persons as one proper person / so that every nacyon / every tongue / every
sect / every age / as well old as young / may with one assent auaunce and
praise thy most holy name. And I would to god that we also / which bear the
name of thy children / were not dishonestie to thy glory / amongst those yt
know the not: for like as a good and wise son is the glory and honor of
his father / so a folisshe and unthrifty child / gets his father
dishonestie and shame / and he is not a natural and proper child / whosoever
do not labor all that he can to follow and be like his father in wit and
conditions: But thy son^e Jesus is a very kind and natural child / for he is
a very full and perfect image and similitude of the / whom holly he is like and
represents. We which are become thy children by adopcion and not by nature /
confermyng our selfs after his ensample / endeauer as much as lies in us /
to come to some manner likeness of y^: that likewise as thou waste most
parfitely exalted and glorified in thy son^e Jesus: so as farforth as our
weakness will suffer / thou may be glorified also in us / but the ways
how thou may be glorified in us / is / if the world perceive that we live
after ye teaching and doctrine of thy son^e that is to say / if they se that we
love the above all thing / and our neighbor and brother no less than our own
selfs / and that we ever bear good my^de and love to our ennemy and adversary
/ also well doing and profyting those / which do us injury and wrong: For
these things thy son badde us we should do / when he provoked us to the
following and likeness of our father in heaven / which commands his sone to
shine upon good and yuell: And how great a shame and dyshoneste are they to
thy glory / which when they have professed and taken upon them thy name /
natwithstandynge / do robbery and theft: commyt aduoutrie: chyde and braule:
study to revenge: go about to disceyue: forswere them self by thy most holy
name: among also sclaundre and backebyte: have their belly as their god:
dispyce the / and do service and homage to worldely richesse. And truly the
commen sort of people for the most perte / esteem god after the lyueng and
co^dicions of his servants. For if they may parceyue that they which have
professed thy name / live viciouslye: thanne they cry out and say. What a god
is he / that has such manner of worshippers? Fie on such a master that has
so vnrewly servants: Out upon such a father / whose children be so leude:
Banisshed be such a king / yt has such manner of people and subjects. Thy
son therefore consydring this / taught us that likewise as he both lyueeng
and dyeng ever glorified thy name / so we also all that we might / should
endeuer by chaste and blameless conditions / to auaunce and preyse the
clerenesse of thy glory / saying unto us. Let your light shine in the sight of
men / that they may se your good works / and in those glorify your father in
heaven. But in us O good father / there is no light at all / except it will
please the to send us any / which art the contynuall and everlasting spring
of all light: nor we of our selfs can bring forth no good works. Therefore
good lord we pray the / let thy goodness work in us / and thy clear light
shine in us: as in all thing that thou have created / does shine thy eternal
and endless power / thy wisdom unable to be expressed and thy wonderful
goodness which most specially / yet thou vouchsafest to show to mankind.
Now than whyder soever we look / all things glorifye thy name: the erthely
spirits both day and night never lynne prayeng their lord and king: y^
wonderful also and heavenly ingen that we behold: the disagreyng concord
moreover of the elamentes: the flowing and ebbyng of the sea: ye bublisshyng of
ryuers: the enduring courses of waters: so many diverse ky^des of things / so
many kinds of trees and of herbs / so many of creatures / and to every thing
the proper appointed and set nature: As in y^ Adamant stone to draw iron / ye
herbs to cure and heal diseases and sickness: All these things I say /
what other thing do they show to us than the glory of thy name / and that
thou art only very god / only immortal / only of all power and might /
only wise / only good / only merciful / only Just / only true / only
marvelous / only to be loved and had in reverence. Than father / we may well
se that he does wrong to thy glorious name / who soever take upon him self to
be called by any of these names / for though there be in us any of these
rehearsed virtues / yet all that comes to us from thy liberal goodness.
Grant now therefore father / that thy name on every side be glorified / and
that the light and glory of thy name / may no less appear and shine in our
manners and lyuenge / than it shyneth in thy Angels / and in all thing that
thou have created and made: that in likewise as they / which behold and look
upon this world of the wonderful and marvelous workemanshippe / do guess
the excellency of the maker thereof: so they that know the not / moved and
stered by our example / may both confess their own misery and wretchedness
and marvel thy liberal goodness / and by these means turned and converted
/ may together with us glorify the most holy name of the / of thy son^e / and of
the holy ghost / to whom indifferently all honor and glory is due for ever.
Amen.

The second peticion.
ADueniat regnum tuum. O father in heaven / which art the only causer / maker
/ savior / restorer / and governor of all / both i^ heaven and in earth / out
of whom comes and proceeds all authorite / power / kingdom / and rule /
as well to things uncreated as created / as well to things invisible as visible
/ whose trone and seat of majesty is the heaven: and the earth as fotestole:
whose kyngly septre and mace / is thine eternal and most establisshed will /
whom no power is able to withsta^de. Ones thou promisest thy people by ye
mouths of thy prophets / for the health of makynde / a certain spiritual
realm which should bry^g into liberte / those that were thine and borne anewe
in the / and should deliver them out of the tyrannous ha^delyng of the fend /
which in time past reigned as prince in the world / sore entangled and
combred with sin. And to the gettyng and optaynynge of this realm / thou
vouchsauest to send from heaven down into the earth thy only son^e / which
with the loss of his own life / redemynge us / where we were before servants
of the devil / should make us the children of god: and verily thy son /
while he lived here in earth / was wont to call his gospel / the heavenly
kingdom a the realm of god: whose knowledge yet he said to be hid and kept
secret from us / but not wtstandyng / thy children humbly require / and with
feruente desire / beseke the that this realm / which our lord Jesus chal^ged
for the / might daily more and more be disclosed and opyned here in earth /
until that time come / in which that same thy son shall restore and render
it up to the full and hole / when all those have subdued themself / whom thy
goodness or the begy^nyng of ye world has appointed to dwell in this realm.
And wha^ all obstinate and rebelleous spirits / and all malycious and yuell
desires be fully quenched and wyped away / which hiderto and at this day /
make war and insurrection against thy majesty / which vex and unquiet thy
co^munalte / what time thy royalme shall be in sure peace and tra^quillite: For
verily as yet the world / by all the means and subtilties it can / oppresses
thy children / wa^dryng here bodily in earth as yet: also corrupt and unclean
affections / and old original synue / rebel and strive against the spirit: as
yet noyous and wicked spirits / which thou banyssheddest / and put out of the
heavenly cite / do assaut with fyrely darts from above those / whom thou of thy
mere goodness have divided from this world / and as chosen folk and
parttakers of thy son / have appointed to thy royalme. Grant father of all
might / that they / whom thy goodness ones has delivered from the tyranny of
sin / and assygned to dwell in thy royalme / may by the benifitte of the
same benygne goodness continue / and steadfastly abide in their liberte and
fredome: and that none leaving and failing from the and thy son / return
again in the tyrannous service of the devil: and so both we by thy son
shall reign in the to our welthe / and thou in us to thy glory: for thou art
glorified in our bliss / and our bliss is of thy goodness. Thy son^e Jesus
taught us we should dispice the realm of this world / which stands all by
richesse / and is hold up by garriso^s of men / by hosts and armor / which
also what soever it does / does by pride and violence / and is both gotten /
kept / and defended by fierce cruelnesse: and he with the holy ghost / overcame
ye wicked spirit that ruled as chief and heed in the world: before he by
innocence and pureness of living / had the victory of sin / by meekness
venquesshed cruelnesse / by suffrau^ce of many dispitefull rebukes / recovered
everlasting glory / by his own death restored life / and by his cross had
triumph upon the wicked spirits. Thus wonderfully have thou father warred and
overcome: after this manner thou both triumphest and reignest in thy son Jesus
/ by whom it has pleased the of thy goodness / to take us in to the
co^gregacio^ of the dwellers in thy royalme. Thus also thou tryu^phest and
reignest in thy holy martyrs / in thy chaste virgins and pure confessors /
which yet neither by their own strength nor power / did overcome the
fiersenesse and displeasure of tyrants / ne the raging or the wanto^nesse of
the flesh / ne the maliciousness of this world. But it was thy spirit
father / Which it pleased the to give them to ye glory of thy name / and the
health of mankind / that was both the begy^ner and ender of all this in them:
And we father / hertely desire the / that thy realm may florisshe also in us:
which all though we do no miracles / for asmoche as neither time nor matter
requires: albe it we be not imprisoned nor turmented: though we be not wounded
nor brent / although we be not crucified nor drowned: though we be not
beheeded: yet natwithstandyng / the strength and clerenesse of thy realm: may
shine and be noble in us / if the world perceive / that we by the help of thy
spirit / stand steadfast and sure against all assautes of the devil / and
against the flesh: which always stereth and provoke us to those things /
that be contrary to the spirit / and agay^st the world / which by all the
ways it can / moves us to forsake and leave the trust that we have ones put
in the / As often so ever as for thy love we despice and set naught by the
realm of this world / and with full trust hang upon the heavenly kingdom /
that thou have promised us: as often also / as we forsake and leave honourynge
of erthely richesse / and only worship and enbrace ye precious and gostly
lernyng of the gospel / as often as we refuse those things / that for the
season seem sweet and pleasant to the flesshely and carnal appetite / and in
hope and trust of eternal felicite we suffer patiently and valiantly all
thing / be it never so hard: as often also as we can be content to forsake
our natural affections / and that which we have most dear / as our fathers
and mothers / wives / children / and kynsefolke / for the love of the: Likewise
as often as we oppress and refrain ye furious and fiercely braydes of anger /
and give mylde and meke words / to those y^ chyde and ^raule with us / and do
good to them / which do us injury and wrong: and all for thy sake. So often
father thou warrest in us / and ouercomest the realm of the devil / and
openyst y^ might and power of thy realm. Thus it has pleased and lyked thy
wisdom father / by continual and grievous battle / to exercise / confyrme /
and make steadfast the virtue and strength of thy people. Increase such
strength in thy children / that they may ever return stronger from their
batayle^ and that when by little and little / their enemies and adversaries
might is minysshed and broken thou may every day more and more raygne in us:
But the time is not yet come good father / in which all the world have
subdued them self to thy yoke: For as yet / that tyrannous fend has a do
with many and diverse nations: There is not yet one herd / and one herd
master / which we hope shall be / when the jews also shall bring and submyt
them self to the spiritual and gostely lernyng of ye gospel: for yet many
know not how great a liberte it is / and what a dignite / and how great a
felicite / to be subjects to the heavenly realm: and that is the cause why
they had rather be the servants of the devil / than thy children inheritours
with Jesus / and parttakers of ye ky^gdome of heaven / and amongst those two
father / that walk within the cloister of thy church / and seem as chief in
thy realm / there are not a few / (alas) which hold on their adversaries
side: and as much as lies in them / abate / shame / and dishonest the glory
of thy realm. Werfore we specially desire and wisshe for that time / which
thou would none to know but thy self alone / in which / acordyng to the
promise of thy son / thy angels shall come and make clean the floor of thy
church / and gader to guether into thy barn the pure corn / divided and
severed fro the cockle / and pluck out of thy realm / all manner occasyon of
sclaundre / What time there shall neither be hunger nor pouerte: no necessite
of clothi^g: no disease: no death: no pursuer: no hurt or yuell at all / ne any
fear or suspicion of hurt but than all the body of thy dear sosie heaped
together in their heed / shall take f^uicion and pleasure of thy blessed company
of heaven. and they which in the mean time had rather serve the tyrannous
fend / shall together with their master be banysshed and sent away to
everlasting punisshement: And trewely this is the realm of Israel / which
when Jesus Christ forsook the earth / and returned again to his disciples /
desired / might shortly be restored. Than thou made heaven free and rydde
from all rebellion / what time Lucifer^ with his company was cast out. So ones
in the day of dome and judgment when the bodies shall arise / thou shalt
depart the sheep from the gottes: and than who so ever has here with all
d^^^ge^ce embrased the spirytuall and goollely realm of the gospel / shall be
desired and brought to the / to the inherytau^ce of the everlasting kingdom /
to ye which thy goodness had appointed them or the world was made. This
fortunate and happy day which thy son Jesus promised should come / we thy
children good father / greatly desire / which dwell here in earth as
outlawes in exyle / sore lodened with the hugeness of the erthely body /
suffryng in the mean time / many grievous displeasures / and sorowyng that we be
withdrawn from thy company / whereof than we shall have perfect pleasure and
fruycion / When face to face we shall se and behold our king and father /
reigning in his great glory. And yet we have not this hope and trust of our
own merits and deserts / which we know verily as non / but only of thy
liberal goodness: Whereby it lyked the to bestow thine own son holly for
us / and to send us the holy ghost as pledge and token of this inheritance:
and if it will please the also to grant / that we may steadfastly and without
any waueryng / continue in thy son Jesus: than thou can not depart us from
the company of thy realm: To whom with that same thy son^e and the holy ghost
/ all renome / honor / and glory is due world without end. Amen.

The third peticion.
EIat voluntas tua sicut in ceso et in terra. O father which art the noryssher
and ordrer of all / whom it pleases thy son to aknowlege as his brethren /
and he so aknowlegeth all those / yt in pure faith professes his name in
baptysme: Thy children here in earth call and cry to ye dwelling in heaven / a
place far out of all chau^geable mutabilite of things created / desyryng in
deed / to come to thy heavenly and celestial company / which is defouled with
no manner spotte of yuell / saving they know well that non can be taken and
received in to so great a tranquillite and quietness / but only they / which
with busye study / while they live here / labor to be such as there must be:
Therefore it is all one realm / both of heaven and earth / saving this
difference / that here we have sore and grievous conflicte with the flesh / the
world / and the devil: and there all though there is nothing that might
minysshe or defoyle the welthe of blessed souls: Yet as touching the full
perfection of felicite / there is some manner mysse / which is / that all the
members and parts of thy son be gathered together / and that the hole body
of thy son / safe and sound be joined to his heed / Whereby neither Christ
shall lack any of his parts and me^bres / nor good men's souls their
bodies: which likewise as they were ever here in earth parttakers of their
puni^sshementes and afflictions: so their desire is to have them companio^s of
their joy in heaven. And they finally in this world / go about to follow the
unite and concord of the heavenly kyngedome / which all the time they live
bodily in earth / as it becomes natural and obedient children / study with
all diligence to fulfill those things / which they know shall content thy
mind and pleasure / and not what their own sensual appetite gives them / ne
iugyng or disputyng why thou would this or that to be done / but thynkyng it
sufficient / that thus thou would it / whom they know surely to will nothing
/ but that that is best. And what thy will is / we learned sufficiently of thy
only begotton and most dear son. He was obeydient to thy will / even to his
own death / and thus he said / for our lernyng and instruction. Father / if it
may conuenyently be / suffer this drink of my passion to be withdrawn from me
/ how be it / yet thy will be fulfilled and not mine. So that tha^ needs must
man be a shamed / to prefer and set forth his own will / if Christ our
master was content to cast his own will away / and subdue it to thine. The
flesh has his propre will and delight / which man naturally desires to keep
and follow. The world also has a will by it self / and the devil his will /
far contrary to thine. For the flesh coueteth against the spirit which
we have received of the: and the world entyseth us to set our love on frail
and vanysshyng things: and the devil labors about that / that might bring
man to everlasting destruction. Nor it is not enough / yt in baptyme we have
professed / yt we will be obedient to thy precepts / and there to have
renounced the deuyls service / except we labor all our life / to perform
steadfastly that / which we have professed: But that we can not perform / but
if thou give us strength / to help forth our purpose: so that our will have
no place in us / but let thy will father work in us that / which thy wisdom
judges and thinks best for us. Who so ever lives after the flesshly and
carnal appetite they are deed to the / and than not as thy children. Ye / and
we thy children also / as long as we are here bodily in earth / have among not
a litell business and a do / in venquesshyng the flesshly delight: which
laboreth to prevent thy will: but grant good father / that thine ever overcome
and have y^ better / whether it like the we live or dye / or to be punisshed
for our correction / or be in prosperity / to the intent we should give the
thanks for thy liberal goodness. And they follow and obey the will of the
devil / which do sacrifice and homage to idols / which sclau^derously
backebite thy most honorable son / and for envy and yuell will / go about to
bring their neighbor in to peril and destruction: and so they may shortly
wax rich / care not whether they do right or wrong / and are al fulfilled
with corrupt and unclean thoughts / But this is thy will father / that we
should keep both our body and mind chaste and pure from al vnclenesse of the
world / and that we should prefer and set more by thine honor and thy
sons / tha^ all other things beside. And that we should be angry with no man
/ ne envy or revenge any man / but always be ready to do good for yuell: ye /
and to be content rather with turmentes / hunger / imprisonement / banysshement
/ and death / than in any thing to be contrary to thy pleasure: And that we
may be able every day more and more / to perform all this / help us O father
in heaven / that ye flesh may ever more and more be subject to the spirit /
and our spirit of one assent / and one mind with thy spirit. And likewise as
now in diverse places thy children / which are obedient to the gospel / obey
and do after thy will: so grant they may do in all the world beside / that
every man may know and understand / that thou alone art the only heed and
ruler of al thing / and that in like wise as there are none in heaven / Which
mutter and rebel against thy will / so let every man here in earth / with good
mind and glad chere obey thy will and godly precepts. Nor we can not
effectually and fully mind what y^ good lord wyllest / except it will please
the to pluck and draw us thereto. Thou co^maundest us to be obedyent to thy
will and pleasure / and in deed they are not worthy to be called children / but
if in all points they follow and obey their fathers byddyng: but sith it has
liked thy goodness to take us / although far unworthy into so great an
honor of thy name: let it please the also of thy gentylnesse to give us a ready
and steadfast will / that in nothing we ouerhippe or be against that / which
thy godly and divine will has appointed us / but that we kill and mortifye our
flesshly and carnal lusts / and by thy spirit be led to ye doing of all
good works / and al thing that is pleasant under thy sight. Whereby you father
may aknowledge us as thy children natural / and not out of kind / and thy
son as kind and good brethren: that is to say / that both twain may
aknowledge in us his own propre benefyte / to whom with the holy ghost equal
and indifferent / glory is due for ever. Amen.

The fourth peticion.
PAnem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie. O father in heaven / which of thy
excedyng goodness / most plentuously fedest all things yt thou have so
wondersly created / provide for us thy children / which are chosen to dwell
in thy celestial and heavenly house / and that hang holly and only of thy
son^e / some spiritual and goostly fode / that we obeyng thy will and
precepts / may daily increase and wax bigger in virtue / until after the
course of nature we have optayned and gathered a full and perfyte strength in
our lord Jesus Christ. The children of this world / so long as they are not
banysshed ne out of their friends favor / all that time they take little care
of their meat and drink: sith their fathers of their tender love toward
them / make sufficient provision for them. Than much less ought we to be
careful or studious / whom thy son Jesus taught should cast away all care
of the morrow meal / perswadyng and assuring us / that so rich a father / so
gentle / so loving / and that had so great mind of us / and which sent
meat to the little birds / and so nobly clotheth ye lyles in the medowe /
would not suffer his children / which he has endued with so honorable a name
/ to lack meat and bodily apparayle: but all thing set aside that belongs
to the body / We should specially and above all / seek and labor about those
things / which pertayneth and belongs to thy realm / and the justice
thereof. For as touching the iustes of the pharisees that sauereth all carnally /
thou utterly dispysest and set naught by: For the spiritual iustes of thy
realm / stands by pure faith and unfeigned charity. And it were no great
matter or show of thy plentye / to feed with breed made of corn the body /
which although it perisshed not for hunger / yet it must needs dye and
perysshe within short space / either by syckenesse / age / or other chance /
but we thy spiritual and goostly children / desire and crave of our spiritual
father / that spiritual and celestial breed / Whereby we are verily relyued /
which be verily and truly called thy children: y^ breed is thy word full of
all power / both the gyuer and norissher of life: Which breed you vouchesauest
to send us down from heaven / what time we were like to have perisshed for
hu^gre. For verily / the breed and teaching of the proud philosophers and
pharisees / could not suffice and content our mind: But that breed of thine /
which thou sendest us / restored deed men to life / of which who soever does
eat shall never dye. This breed relyued us: by this breed we are norysshed and
fatted: and by this we come up to the perfect and full strength of ye spirit.
This breed though day by day it be eaten and distributed to every bowell of the
soul / yet but if thou father do give it / it is not wholesome nor any thing
avails. The blessed body of thy dear son is the breed / whereof we be all
parttakers / yt dwell within thy large house of the church. It is one breed
that indifferently belongs to us all / likewise as we are but one body / made
of sondrye and diverse members / but yet quickened with one spirit: and though
al take of this breed / yet to many it has been death and destruction / for it
can not be relefe / but to such as thou reachest it unto / mynglynge it with
thy heavenly grace / by the reason whereof it may be wholesome to the receyuours.
Thy son^e is verite and troth / troth also is the breed and teaching of the
gospel / Which he left behind him for our spiritual fode / and this breed
likewise to many has been unsavory / which have had ye mouth of their soul out
of taste / by the fever of corrupt affections. But and it will please the good
father to give forth this breed / than it must of necessite be sweet and
pleasant to the eaters: tha^ it shall comfort those that be in tribulation /
and pluck up those that be slydden and fallen down / and make strong those
that be sick and weak / and finally bring us to everlasting life. And for
asmoche as the imbecilite and weakness of manes nature / is ever ready and apt
to declyne into the worse / and the soul of man so co^tynually assauted and
laid at with so many subtle ingyns / it is expedient and necessary / that
thou daily make strong and he^^ thy children with thy breed / which else are
far unable to resyst so many and so strong enemies so many assautes / and
so many fearful and terrible darts. For who father might abide to be had in
derision of the world / to be outlawed and banisshed / to be put in prison:
to be fettred and manacled: to be spoiled of all his goods / and by strong
hand / be deprived of the company of his most dear wife and well-beloved
children / but if now and tha^ / he were hertened with thy heavenly and gostly
breed? He that teaches the lernyng of the gospel / he is he / ye gives us
forth this breed / which yet he gives all in vain / except it be also given
by ye. Many there are / which receive the body of thy son^e / and that here
the word and doctrine of the gospel / But they depart fro thence no stronger
than they came / because they have not deserved that thou good father /
should privily and inuisibly reach it forth unto them. This breed / O most
benign father / give thy children every day / until that time come / in
which they shall eat of it / at thy heavenly and celestial table: Whereby the
children of thy realm shall be fulfilled with ye plentuous abundancye of
everlasting truth. And to take fruicio^ thereof / it were a marvelous
felicite and pleasure / which has need of none other thing at all / neither
in heaven nor earth: For in the O father alone is all thing / out of whom is
right naught to be desired / which toguyther with thy son and the holy
gooste / raygnest for ever. Amen.

The fyfte peticion.
EL dimitte nobis debita nostra / sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.
This is thy will and mind O father in heaven / which art the maker of peace
and favorer of concord / that thy children / whom it has pleased thy goodness
to couple and join in the bo^des of one assent: and whom thou quickenest with
one spirit / and with one baptysme purgest and make clean / and in one house
of the church aco^panyest / and with the common sacraments of the church
do norisshe: and whom thou have indifferently called to the inheritance of
the kyngedome of heaven / because they should be of more strength / and should
live toguyder in thy house of one mind: and that there should be no strife or
contencion amongst the parts and members of one body / but each to live in
charity with other: Yet in so much as they are feign to keep still their
mortal body / it can not be chose / but by reason of the weakness and
frailte of nature among / displeasure and offenses shall chance / whereby
though the clerenesse of brotherly love and concord be not utterly extinct and
quenched / yet it is made all faint and cold / and like in conclusion to be
quenched: Except you father of thy great gentylnesse and mercy / should daily
forgive those that every day offended the: for as often as we offend our
brother / so often also we offend and displease ye father / which
co^mau^deddest we should love our brother as our own self / but thy son
knowing well enough the imbecilite and weakness of this membre / showed us a
remedy therefore / gyuyng us sure hope yt thy goodness would remytte and
forgive us all our offenses / if we on the other side with all our heart would
forgive our brother / what so ever he trespaceth against us / and this is a
very equal and indifferent way to obtain perdon and forgyuenesse / which
thy son^e Jesus has assigned: For how can any man be so bold to desire his
father to withdraw his reue^gynge hand from him / if he him self go about to
revenge a little offense in his brother / or who is of so shameless boldness
/ that would not be afraid to say to the / Slake thy anger / when he
contynueth in rancoure and malice still toward his brother? And how can he
surely boost and auaunce him self as a membre of thy son / which being fre
from all sin him self / prayde the to forgive the thieves on the cross / if
he all entangled with sin / and a sinner could not find in his heart to
forgive his brother / against whom now and than he offends? so that
amongst us it may be called rather as mutual change of perdone / than very
forgyuenesse: that sacrifice is impleasaunt in thy sight / which is offered in
remembrance of displeasure or negligence / of reconcylyng his brothers good
will. Therefore thy son gave us this in commandment / that we should leave
our offering even at ye auter / and hye us a pace to our brother / and labor to
be in peace with hy^ / and than return again and offer up our reward: Law
now / we follow yt thy son has taught us / we endeuer to perform that he
has done / if thou aknowlege the covenant and bargayne made of thy son^e / as
we dout not but thou do / grant us we beseke the / that thing whereof we had
full hope and trust by thy son: Thus he bad us pray when he answered not a
few times / yt we should obtain what soever we desired of y^ in his name he
made us bold to pray to the / vouchesafe thou by him / to forgive those that
call upon the: we aknowlege our own imbecilite and feblenesse / whereby we well
perceive / in to how shamfull and abhomynable offenses we were like to fall
into / except we were preserved by thy goodness from gretter sins: and the
same meekness thou leftest in us / as a remedy against ye pride which we
should have been in ieopardy to have fallen in daily: We offend and fall / to
the intent that every day we might glorify thy ge^tylnesse: Grant father that
we may hertely forgive our brethren / that wha^ we be in peace and unite
amongst our selfs / we may have the always merciful unto us / and if in any
thing we offend the / amend us with thy fatherly correction / so that thou
utterly forsake us not / nor disinherite us / ne cast us in to hell: ones in
baptyme thou have remytted us all our sy^nes / but that was not inoughe / for
thy tender love toward us / but thou have also showed a sure and ready remedy /
for the daily offenses of thy children / for the which we thank thy great
ge^tylnesse / which vouche sauest by thy son and the holy ghost / to endewe
us with so great benifytes / to the ever lastyng glory of thy most holy name.
Amen.

The sixte peticion.
EL ne nos in ducas in tentationem. O good father in heaven / albeit there is
nothing that we greatly fear / having the merciful unto us / and while
mutual love and charity each with other / makes us thy children of more
strength against every yuell assaut / yet when we consydre how weak and
frail the nature of man is / and how ignorant also we be / whom thy
goodness will judge and think worthy the contynuaunce in thy love / to the
end of this life / in which as long as we are / a thousand manner of ways we
be stered to fall and ruin / therefore we can not be utterly seker and
careless: all this life is round about be set with the dyuelles snares / he
never cesseth temptynge us / which was not a frayde with crafty subtylteis to
set upon thy son Jesus / We call to mind how grievously the fend assauted
thy servant Job: We remember how Saull was first thy elect and chosen
servant / and within a while after cast out of they light: We can not forget
how Dauyd whom you calleddest a man even after thine own appetyte / was drawn
to that great villainy of sin / that he mengled aduoutre with ma^slaughter: We
co^sydre how Solomon whom in the beginning of his rule / thou gave wisdom
above all men / was brought to that madness and folly / that he did sacrifyce
to strange and utter gods: We remember also / what befell the chief and heed
of thine apostles / which after that he had so valyantly professed / that he
would dye with his master / natwithsta^dyng thrice forsware his master. These
and such many other / when we co^sydre / we can not but fear and aborre the
ieopardy of temptacion: and thy fatherly love would us always to be in this
fear / because we should not sluggisshely and slouthfully begin to trust in
our own help / but defend and arm our self against every saute of
temptacion with sobre temperau^ce / watch / and prayer: whereby we should
neither provoke our ennemy / remembering our own feblenesse / nor be ouerthrone
in ye storm of temptacion trustyng to thy aid / with out which we are able
to do right naught / you suffrest among te^ptacion to fall / either to prove and
make steadfast the suffrau^ce and patience of thy children / as Job and Abraham
were tempted / or else by such scourges to correct and chasten our offenses:
but how often soever thou suffrest this / we pray the thou wylt bring that
same temptacion to good and lucky end / and give us strength egall to the
mou^tenaunce and weight of the yuels yt come upon us / it is no little ieopardy
when soever we be thretned with loss of our goods / with banysshement / rebukes
/ imprisonment / with bands and bodily turmentyng / and horrible and fearful
death But we are in no less peril at all / when prosperity to much laugheth
on us / than when we be over much feared with trouble and aduersyte: They are
an i^numerable sort which fall on every side / some for fear of punysshment
do sacrifyce to wicked deuyls / some ouerthrone and astonyed with yuels and
vexacio^s / do blaspheme thy most holy name: and again / some drowned with
ouermoche worldely welthe / set at naught and dyspice thy gifts of grace /
and return again in to their old and former fylthynesse / as the son that
the scripture speaks of / which after time he had spent and reuelled out
all his fathers substance / by unthrifty and ungracious rule / was brought to
that misery and wretchedness / that he enuyed the swyne their chafe. We know
well good father / that our adversary has no power over us at all / but by thy
suffraunce: Wherefore we be content to be put to what soever ieopardy it
pleases the / so it will like thy gentylnesse to measure our ennemys assaute
and our strength / for so though we be sometime in the first metyng to weak /
yet thy wisdom in the conclusyon will turn it to our welthe. So thy most
dear and honorable son / was ever wont to overcome the devil: thus the
flesh: and thus the world: that when he seemed most to be oppressed / he
than most specially triumphed / and he fought for us / he overcame for us /
and triumphed for us: Let us also overcome by his ensample with thy help / and
by the holy ghost / procedyng from both for ever. Amen

The seventh peticion.
SEd libera nos a malo. O almighty father / it has pleased thy mere and
liberal goodness / ones when we were rydde from sy^ne / to deliver us by thy
son^e Jesus Christ / out of the hands of our most foul and unclean father
the devil / and to elect and take us in to the honor both of thy name and
thine inherytau^ce: but yet of this condycion that all the while we live here
in earth we should be in co^tynuall batell with our enemy / nothing mystrust /
but that thou will perform that which we desire of the. Amen.

Thus ends thexposicion of the Pater noster. Imprinted at London in
Fletestrete / in the house of Thomas Berthelet nere to the Cundite / at the
sign of Lucrece.

Cum priuilegio a rege in du^^o.
