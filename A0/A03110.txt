A balade of a priest that lost his nose For saying of mass as I suppose.
WHo so list bear of a wondrous chance
Of late I met with one did me tell
The craftiest priest in England or France
Has lost his nose, and how should he smell
He went to his freinde his mind to disclose
And as he came home one cut of his nose.
It is a gentleman, a priest he told me
To tell you his name I do not much pass
It is old sir John the vycar of Lee
which rayles at gods book and reeles at his mass
His cankarde mind he cannot keep close
yet he served him shrewdly that cut of his nose.
His smeller is smitten clean from his face
yet was there but one as he did say
Which caught him and plucked of his nose in that place
A hie man, a low man, a fox, or a graye
Ten shillinges he says in his purse be did lose
I think he lied thereof, but not of his nose
Great serching was sense that smeller to seek
Some for have left their scabbert at home
Some had gunnes some halberts some forked pikes
some in shyrts of maile like a lusty mome
There was never seen before I suppose
Such tossing and tombling for a priests nose.
Some men yt thought him no harm in there life
But because they fear God, and do go about
To live with pure conscience and be without strife
They ar bound to the peace now for a priests snoue
But because he can keep men's horedom so close
Therefore they make such a work for his nose.
Because his scollers did mock at his mass
He said he would make blood run by their heles
But God has turned the plage from their arse
And he with his nose did bloody the styles
with blood I hard say as red as a rose
he drunk well belike before he lost his nose.
What manner of nose was it sir ye sought for
A black nose, a red nose, or one like my fist
To be without nose was the mark of an whore
And now it is the mark of an whorishe priest
And now you are ryd right well of the nose
Why do you make such a work for your nose.
Or was your nose somewhat wan or pale
A blewe nose a bottle nose, or was it yellowe
Nos autem have seen it sometime at the ale
Libera nos salua nos from the swap of ye swalowe
But why did ye use sir to lie so and gloss
was it any marvel though ye lost your nose.
Some men are living to whom he did say
Seeing he knew the truth, if ever he said mass
He wished that some membre might be cut away,
Now at his request it is come to pass
Much work he does make for the lo^p he did lose
well, what will ye give sir for a new nose.
But what shall we say, if men do not lie
who cut of the priests nose it is hard to judge
But he him self I think did it of envy
And then to bewite it to them he did grudge
That thereby they might there kingdom up close
As sometime Sopirus did snap of his nose
For sometime he says it was but a mome
And eftsone a talle man this he does name
But still he affyrmeth it was but one
which caught him and brought his nose out of frame
Could one man so do it as you suppose
Except he were willing to have of his nose.
Remedy is none, but this thing is true
His snout is snapts of how^oeuer it was
I think it were best to make him a new
As sone he may do it, as god at his mass
if he cannot make him a snout, I suppose
he can not make god no more then his nose
Seeing the true God is gone from your town
And god Pean and Baccus does rule in his stead
with hoysty and soysty over shoulder and crown
yet has he no more life then a lompe of lead
if he have, then charge him that man to disclose
which met you and caught you, and cut of your nose.
But if you do use the true god to mock
And give his honor to your god in the purse
Look whom ye bless, and in blyndnesse rock
The living god will you and your blessings curse
And at length your falsehed to all men disclose
And the^ no dout your head will follow your nose
Take heed I say you chaplyns of Balle
Though ye have fed long at Iesabels board
Not long but helias shall give you a fall
Repent and return to the living Lord
Though ye prick till blood run by your toes
there will a worse chance com the^ lesing your nose
I will not pray for you, let them do that list
For fear God with me should be miscontent
Seeing of purpose the holy ghost you resist
And if ye have clean forgotten to repent
when God shall the secrets of all men disclose
ye shall have as much help as the priest of his nose
But you have a vauntage sir if you mark all
if a mous catch your god when ye have made it
Then ye may catch the mouse fast by the wall
For how can you hurt your nose except ye had it
The proverb is true in you I suppose
He cannot tell where to turn his nose.
Finis.
God save the Queen.
