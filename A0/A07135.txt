certain bysshoppes and abbottes and other of his friends as he should seche
help and counseyll of them. And as they were come to gyder he said I see and
understand my lords and friends that I shall not long live / wherefore I
dsyre you to give me wholesome cou^seyl what I might do for the health of my soul
For I know well that wyckedly I have lived hitherto. and I shall be dampened in
hell. And therefore what may I now do. Than they said If ye will have
forgyuenes of your sins / and desire to be saved / we auyse you that ye leave
your kingdom / and let your head be shave / and take on you the habyte and
clothing of a monk / for this only remains for hope of your salvation /
and many by this have be saved. Therefore do this that ye may be saved Than the

blessed virgyn Maryes monk / she has gotten of her sone forgyuenesse of all
his sins / and tho have also everlasting life and. Joy in heaven: And
therefore what thing have ye to do with him Know ye not that as in baptym all
sins be forgyuen / and everlasting life is grauneted es So the great mercy
and pity of our lord Ihesu christ does away a man's sins that takes of
him the order of a monk and keeps it: Therefore of some it is called a second
baptymme: And how be it that this foresaid king sinned much yet at the last he
sore repented him / and with his weeping washed away his sins. And more
over he was a monk of the gloryouse virgyne and mother of god saint Marye / the
which has gotten of her sone for him remyssyon of his sins / and
everlasting life in heaven. And also she has send me hither to bring his
soul before god. And when the angel had said this / he took up with him the
soul with great melodye / and went his way- Trewly thanne these wicked
spyrytes and mynystres of the devil with a full great cry vanysshed away as
the smoke does fro the fire not knowing the great mercy of our blessed lord
Jesus christ and the goodness of the gloryouse virgyne his mother to whom be
now and evermore worship and Joy Amen.

IN a certain abbay there was a monk yt was sexten full devout to our blessed
lady. and loved her in a clean heart / Sothely he had his bed in the church
/ and used every night both before macyns and after full long time deuoutely
to prade upon his knees on the bare ground before an image of our lady
largely wenyng for his sins and when he had wept and said his prayers / thus
he would say to the image of our lady. O blessed lady that art so fair in
earth / how incomparble art thou most fairest in heaven. Sothely he were
blessed that might see thy fayrenes. I wot well that I am unworthy. But good
lady after the virtue of thy power you may make me worthy. And in this wise

blessed lady knowing his desire appeared to him in his sleep ha / uynge in her
hand a book written with golden letters. And it seemed to a monk that all the
church was enflammed of fire. And as he skypped out of his bed / he fill
before the fete of our blessed lady / and looked in her face that was bryghter
than the sone And she opened the book / in the which was written the prophecye
of Ysaye / of the which the monk gretely Ioyed but much more he delyted to
behold the fayrenesse and the rose color of her face. and said. O most
blessed lady saint Marye / suffer me ones to kiss thy fete. Than she smyled
and said in this wise to him. I will not yt thy mouth with the which you have
so oftymes lauded me / touch my fete / but thy mouth shall touch my mouth /
and the clerenes of my face. Than our lady saint Marye kyssed him / and for
Joy thereof he thought him self rauysshed. And when this monk remembered well
that sweet dreme / and for the great gladness of his heart full largely he
wept. And ever after all the-dayes of his life full deuoutely he served our
blessed lady.

How our lady apperyd to monks that were at matyns / and showed her sone to
them and sayd-Eccemerces vestra.
IN a certain great abbay on crystmas night as the monks were at matyns /
full myghtely labourynge i^ dyuyne service sange-deuoutely Te deu^ laudamus.
Our blessed lady saint Marye showed her self to some of them / ye which saw
her go vysybly through ye mids of the quere with a great multitude of
angellys / with Instruments of musyke / laudyng and praysynge our blessed
lord Ihesu. And she bare in her hands her sweet sone our lord Ihesu christ
offering him to them and said. Ecce merces vestra / that is to say. Lo this is
your mede.

How a monk that besely remembered our blessed lady was received of her in to
heaven.
THere was a certain young monk that so much loved our blessed lady saint
Mary that he would never leave her out of his my^de / and what someuer he did /
or whether ever he went / ever more he would deuoutely think on our blessed
lady. And on a time it happened that he fyl seek / to whom came deuylles in
likeness of a^geles which had envy at his clean and holy living / and most
because he loved our blessed lady so much. And one of them said to him I will
hele the. and thou wylt do after my cou^seyl / Truly you doste consume thy
self by ouermoche thinking on Mary / Leave this / and do by dyscrecyon There
be many blessed men in this monastery that think not so much on her / what
avails it to the if thou be cause of thyn own death and lose thy self.
Sothely than this foresaid monk had knowledge by the grace of almighty god
that they were wicked spyrytes and deuylles / wherefore he cast holy water
among them- and than anon all tho wicked spyrytes vanysshed away. Than the
third day the gloryouse virgin saint Mary came to him with a noble heavenly
felawshyp and said. Because thou have had my ever in mind I have not forgoten
the / give me thy soul / for it shall dwell with me euerlastyngly / when our
lady had said this / the monk anon yielded up his spyryte / and our lady
assended up to heaven berynge with her the monks soul / and after the.iij. day
this monk appeared to all his brethern as they were in the / church at dyuyne
service and said / brethern thanke-ye our blessed lady / and worship her by
whom I am saved / and because I had her evermore while I lived in mind / she
has set me in everlasting Joys of heaven / and therefore brethern be ye
myndefull of her yt after your death ye may reygne with her / and when this-was
said he vanysshed away.

Of a monk that was in all things full seruysable to our lady / blessydly
dyed.
ALso it is not to leave out of a monk called Egnesanensi / the which would
never leave any thing undone yt longed to the service of our blessed lady. This
monk on a time was seek / and when he was full nyghe his death / he saw the
gloryouse virgyn Marye and mother of god coming to him / and full glad he was
to see her come to help him. and bowed his head mekely to her as he might and
sange this response. Gaude maria virgo. And when he had song this response /
he yielded up his spyrite at the commandment of our blessed lady / to be bore
in to the bless of heaven by ye seruyse of angels. Therefore al christian people
ought of right to be fervent and brennynge in her service / and to study how
they might please her / not only they yt ben well and virtuously dysposed /
but also they that been sinners and prove to evil. Sothely she is full benynge
and ready to al / and euerychone / right largely to reward them with mede
that woll deserve it. Ryghtful men and sinners none she does forsake / or

deuoutely contynueth in her service / withouten doubt he shall come to the
Joys of heaven.

How a monk worshypped our blessed lady with five psalms after five letters of
her name.
THere was a simple monk yt was called Iostyus / that to our blessed lady was
full devout night and day / bey^g careful how he might please her. And
ofte^tymes with great devotion he used to say on his knees to the worshypp of
our blessed lady the.vij. psalms with other things that he learned in his
youth. And gretely he sorowed that he could no propre thing of laud and
co^mendacyon to her / by the which he might specially worship her or great her.
So at the last after his simple understanding / he dysposed him to say every
day while he lived five psalms for the five lettres yt be in our blessed
lady saint Maryes name Maria: that is to say. for the first letter M
Magnificat. for A. Ad dn^m cu^ tribularer. for R / Retribue seruo tuo. for I.
In conuerte^do. for the second A. Ad te leuaui. And this pleased our blelsyd
lady saint mary. as was showed after his death Trewely there was found after
that he dyceasyd five fair read roses springynge out of his mouth as fresshe
and well smelling as they had be gedryd the same day And this was done be
yonde the sea at a place called Ad sanctu^ audomaru^.

How these two words Aue marya. gloryfyed a knight after his death.
A Certain knight that was rich and noble forsook the world and entered in to
a religyo^ called cistercie^siu^. And by cause he knew no letter on books /
the monks put to him a master that he might somewhat learn / and so by that
occasyon to stand among the monks / for they were ashamed that such a noble
man should stand among the lay people And when he had be long time with a
master and no thing could learn but these two words Aue maria. so fast he
held tho two words / yt whether ever he went / or what some ever he did /
evermore he would say Aue maria. Than at ye last he deyed and was buried in
the church yerde with other. And lo out of his grave spronge a fair lylye /
and every lefe was wreten with golden letters. Aue maria. Than they ran all
thyd for to see so great a sight. And as they dygged the earth out of the grave
they found ye rote of the same foresaid lylye spryngyng out of his mouth /
where by they understood with how great devotion he used in his life to say tho
two words. Aue maria for whom our lord showed so great miracle of worship.

An other miracle of our lady of a good aged woman.
THere was also on a time a good aged woman that knew no more of the salutacyon
of our blessed lady saint Mary but these two words Aue maria. the which
evermore she would say full devoutly / to whose prayers our blessed lady was
enclyned and did by her merytes many miracles. Than the bishop perceiving
this / made her to learn of a clerk all the hole salutato^n of our lady. And
when she used daily to say it as she could. there were no miracles showed by
her. and when ye byssop saw this / he warned her to leave al yt she learned and
so to worship our lady as she did before. and when she so did. miracles came to
her again

How our lady vysyted a monk at his death. for sayng of her service deuoutely.
IN spain in an house of the order of cisterciensiu^ was a young monk yt was
very fervent and devout in our ladies seruyse. And i^ saying ye hours of our
lady he would be so well auysed and soft yt he had mind of her not only in
every verse / but also in every word / so yt an hour of say^g almost would
last him with full great labor an hour of time. And when he had lived in his
order.xvi. year / he fyl seek almost to ye death. And when it was asked of him
yt served him how he did / he told him and said. Our lady of heaven has
vysyted me and told me yt I shall pass hens the vij. day next coming / and
more over to me she said. because you have served me more deuoutely than any
other yt live. I woll do to the yt I did never to none other / and clypped me
about the neck and kyssed me: Therefore the vij. day our blessed lady apered
to this monk with a fair multitude of aungellys / wiche passed hens the same
day as she told him before.

How our lady accused certain relygyouse persons to her sone / because they
said her seruyse irreverently and hastily.
A Certain relygyous man that was labored with sekenes by the which he deyed
and saw before his death him self rapt to Judgment. And when he tarried to have
his Judgment the mother of god came and kneled byfor her sone co^playnynge and
said O most ryghtwyse Judge / this man's brethren full neglygently and breuely
and irreverently say mine hours and therefore command Judgment to pass
against them. Than the Judge took auysement and said in this wise. Let us send
this man to his brethren again that he may warn them / if they will amend
them by him. Sothely than soon after this foresaid seek man was returned to
himself again / and sat up in his bed and told to them that stood about him
tho things that he had seen and herd / besechynge and exortynge them in our
lord Ihesu crystus behalue to amend them of all manner defautes and
neglygences done in gods service and our ladies / lest she be found as she
is to devout persons a mother of mercy / and to them for negligence a queen of
vengeance. And when he had this said before them al he deyed.

Of a monk which had his mind wandering in dyuyne service.
ALso an other monk was that had his mind wandryng about / and in his prayers
undevout / but to our ladies service he behaved him well and dylygently. And
upon a time when his brethren went to church to say matyns / he bode alone at
home lyenge in his bed and he saw a black devil coming to him that took him
up and brought him before a great Judge and said. Lo I have brought to ye one
that long time fayntly and neglygenfly has said thy service. And as the
devil began to take power of him he cried and said / holy Mary help me / and
anon our blessed lady delivered him from the fend

An exortacion to say dyuyne service distynctly
WHo someuer would ordeyne to a great lord a luce or a pyke / and thereof would
some what stele / he would take neither the head / nor ye tail / for it would
be soon aspyed / but the mids Sothely such thieves ben all prestes and
clerks that say their service hastily / for the beginning and the ending of
the verses of ye psalms they stele not / but the words about the mids. But
would god it might fall to them that so done / as it hapened to a certain
priest in the prouynce of Burgone as I herd of a brother of the place of
dunene / how a certain priest used to say full shortly his dyuyne service
whom the devil often sythes lift up on hye in his chauncell / and afterward
myghtely would cast him down sore to the ground. And this said the devil
when he lift him up. Dixit dn^s dn^o meo / and there made a good pause / and
afterward he would cast him down and end ye verse and say / sede a
dexteris meis. Wherefore this priest amendyd him and afterward said his dyuyne
service perfyghtely Sothely they yt told this / herd before of this prestes
fantes / and oftentimes went to him / and of his correctyon and amendment they
gretely meruayled and asked him ye cause / and he told them as it is said
before.

Of a certain saint. in England.
IT is written and told of an holy man in england how he was holden and tarried
in purgatory.l. year after his death because he used for to say his divine
service neglyge^tly / shortly / and breuely

Hw many monks were repreued and blamed for saying neglygently gods service
and their service for the deed.
Now of this miracle that follows here we have taken full faithful and worthy
wytnes as by the mouth and saying of the worshypfull fader Dan: Simon sometime
abbot of Los. The which beside of other gifts of virtue had specially ye
virtue of mekenes above all ye monks of ye prouynce. Sothely he said and told
us yt there was i^ a house and a monasterye of the order of cisterciensis a
certain monk. And after the grace yt our lord Ihesu christ gave him / full
devout in our ladies service. And lest he should leave in relygyon unwarily
but rather so much the better as he did mekely our lord styred up against him
one of his own brethren of ye cloister / the which would constyre all thing
yt. he did to ye worst / and pursued his inocentenes both in words and in
deeds / and not only in this (as a child of grace) our lord Ihesu christ
would have proved but also he excercysed him in other.ij. things of aduersyte.
Of the which one was gostely / and the other bodily. Trewely as often as he
herd thondrynge he might not here it / and so he was so sore troubled and
afraid / that he was almoost at ye point of death. Also a sekenes of lepre that
is called gutta rosia certain time would so corrupt his face that for the
foulnes of syghte he was compelled long while to bide at home in the fermory
often times. And when he was put in the fermorye for this cause / on a night
after matyns as he went to rest / he blamed him self by the sorrow of
co^punctyon and what someuer of leprye he had in his face / committed it
devoutly to our lords mercy Sothely a few days before our lord had vysyted
him so that in short time the abbot and almoost.xv. monks of the covent
blyssedly paste fro this world to heuenwarde. And as this monk was walkyng in
his prayers / he saw a fair felaushyp of monks going through the mids of
ye fermorye / among the which he knew his fader the abbot and his brethteren
that dyed a little before. Of the which one of them came to hy^ and stood by
his bed and said Dear brother we that go here while we lived i^ our bodies
dwelled here in this monasterye. And now we Joy al in hope of the Joy of the
sone of god but yet we be dyfferred fro the entering in of the kingdom of heaven
for the neglygences of some of our brethren. Of the wiche some vndeuoutly /
and some slouly / al full unkindly done to the psalms and prayers / the which
of dute they ought to do for our souls. And not only for this cause they ben
hold gylty to us / but also to our blessed lord Jesus christ has many things
against them. Sothely they provoke and styre him to cast them fro him / because
they follow slouly the vow of relygyon in pure and clean living / and the
precepts of holy relygyon with out any dread of god they break. Also when they
come to gyder as ye time and place required to serve our lord god in psalms /
and ympnes / and other spyrytuell songs / than they neither ete / ne taste
spyrytuel fode / because that euerychone presumes to delight him on vanyte
after his heart / And they suspyre after carnal pleasures that they had in
the world. and their soul sauoureth not the heavenly food that is the word
of god the which they read and sing / but as a mete that is light and
contemtybyll / Trewely this provoke the wrath of god most / that in that
hour when as the brethren enclyne at / Gloria patri. for the reverence /
and worship of the blessed trinyte / some mock and scorn / some Iangell
ydell words / And some make preuely signs of ydelnesse / And other ben so
stiff in heart and in body. that vnnethis after that Gloria patri is begone /
they be bound. and or spiritu sancto be said. they be up again. and with their
syghte they notabely wander about in curyouse things in the walls. And other
be stondynge in prayer like images / and so berafte in sleep that they wot not
what is done about them / and yet nevertheless they enclyne^ and rise up as
other done of a certain miserable and wretchyd custom. therefore go and say to
the abbot on our behalue that he dispose him to correct such fautes of the
brethren. For to him it longet what someuer is done amiss of his brethere^ to
whom he is ordained of god an ouerseer to tell them their sins when this
was said he vanysshed away. Than this monk that herd this rose up stylly fro
his bed / and yede out of ye fermory and so came to ye church as he used to
do before / and before one of ye auters prayed to our lord with all his heart /
and anon he was rapte in spirit. And as he looked to the wyndowe that was
above ye auter / he saw a bright beme of light shynyng and a maruaylouse fair
lady entered through the wyndowe to him. And when she stood by him she said to
him Know thou not me. He answered and sayd^ No lady. Than she said to him: I
am Mary ye mother of Ihesu / and now I am come to comfort ye of thy sorrows and
heuenes. I have herd thy prayers and I saw thy wepynges / and as she said to
him / the brethren that were at dyuyne service sange Gloria patri as they used
to do and enclyned themself / and also our blessed lady and queen of heuen^
with her hondes crosyd full lovely / and reverently enclyned her self at that
same Gloria patri. and stood not up till they had song Sicut erat in
principio / Than after that she stood up and said to the monk again. the
brother the monk that pursued the / which is deed. after his great malice has
received full many sore pains / and in token that this that I have said to
the is truth. thou shall be hole of this two sickness that you haste suffered.
And when our blessed lady saint mary had said this to him / she her self wiped
his face with the sleue of her garment. and so vanysshed away Sothely on the
morrow this monk preuely told to the abbot al thing as it is said before.
and showed both to him and to all his brethern certain and very faith of
these same things by the meruaylous token of the altering and chau^gyng of
his face / which outwardly was hole and clean to the honor and worship of
the gloryouse virgyn and mother of god. the which reygneth with him lady of
angels and queen of heaven euerlastyngly in all worlds of worlds Amen.

An other miracle also of a monk y^ grudged /
THere was a monk / to whom al his metys seemed so hard / yt vnethys he
might take of it to sustain his body / And on a night our lady apperyd to hy^
in his sleep and brought hy^ to an image of our lord Ihesu christ hangyng on a
cross. and said to him in this wise. Wete thy bread in my sons wondes / and
when ye forsayde monk had so do. him seemed and thought that it had a full
sweet and a delycyous taste as a thing that is well poudered.

An other miracle also of a monk / the which was sore in temptatyon.
OVre blessed lady appeared in a vysyon to a certain monk that was sore in
temptatyon / and showed him the state of Joy / and afterward she brought hy^
in to egipte and wyldernes whether she fled with her sone Ihesu for the dread
of Herod. Than she showed the monk the horryblenes of wyldernes / and the
dwelling that she had with the wolves and lions / and also the great cold /
hu^gre / and thyrst / and ye full great werenes that she suffered And when she
had showed this to the monk / she said to him. Loo sone by such
delycyousenesse my sone Ihesus was nourysshed up and I by the same came to the
kingdom of heaven. Therefore take heed of the temptaco^n that my sone Ihesus had*
in wilderness / where he showed to all his folowers and lovers a form of a
spyrytuall vyctorye.

was at matynes in the church and had said yt noctornes thought to spare his
head and to rest hy^ till lauds / and laid hy^ down on a blok yt was before
ye auter / and there slept a little / and anon our blessed lady was at him /
and touched him with her clothe and said. Brother this place is not to sleep in
/ but for to pray. And anon he waked and saw the back of our blessed lady
as she went fro him. And herd a woman's voice saying these words to him.

Also an other miracle of a certain thief

Sothely on a time a certain relygyouse man by the grace of god and good
exhortation turned him from his wicked living / and brought him to a

studijs at ye beginning of his conuersyon virtuously taken more and more / he
labored to proferre fro virtue i^ to virtue by ye which he styred up against
himself the envy and malice of our old and common enemy the devil. And on a
night as he lay alone in his celle as ye use of that relygyon is to refresse
their bodies after labor and prayer he being waking and thynkyng on heavenly
things / vy^ybly apyred to him a company of deuyls in likeness of hogs /
the which went all about in ye celle with a gastfull noise / and gronynge as
they were wode / and came and stood about him as he was in his bed sore
trembling for fere and dread / and as it was told me / he swet for dread no

cowardes might not do And when he had said this / he straught forth to this
good holy man with a gastfull contenaunc^ / a fere full Istrument of iron with
crooked hokes to take him ^ and all to tere him that for fere was all most
mad and out of his mind B^t god that evermore of his great mercy prouydeth
