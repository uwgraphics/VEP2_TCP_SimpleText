A Declaration of Christ and of his office compylyd / by Johan Hoper / Anno
1547.

Matthew. 7. Hic est filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi been co^placuit, ipsum
audite. To the most noble an uictorious Prince Edward Duke of Somerset: Earl
of Hertforthe: uiscount beaue Champe: Lord Semer: Gouerner of the person of the
Kings Majesty: and Protector of all his Realms his leave tenent general of
all his Armies, boothe by land and by sea. Treasurer and Earl Marshall of
Inglo^d. Gouerner of the illes of Gernsey and Iersey and Kynght of the most
Noble order of the garter Iohann Hoper wyshythe grace and peace with long and
gracious lief in the living God throwghe Christ Jesus our only savior.
THe Godly pretense and consideration of your warfare of late into Scotlond
Most grocious and uictorious Prince, and the just occacion yeuen by your
Ennymyes to use the forse of your most mighty and uertews Army: the lord
has so magnyfied with prosperouse and uictorious success: that it semythe
not only a uictory most Noble worthy perpetual memory. But also to be estemyd
as a singular favor and merciful benedictio^, of God yeuen from heaven: Who
accustomy the many times, unto souche a godly pretensyd purpose, to annex and
add an external sign and testimonye of his godd will, that the worold should
not only acknolege him to be the God of batell and say, this thing is don by
the lord and is wounderfull in our yeys but also remember that thus the lord
uisithe to bliss souche as ferithe his name, boothe in war and in peace. And
as Every godly and good man doothe preace the deuyne magestie of God for his
inestimable favor and grace in this heavenly uictorye, so he is to be called
upon always here aster to follow your grace with like ayede and co^solacion.
that the thing godly begone, may take a gracious and blessed success, thold
Amite and frendshippe restoryd that God by the creacion of the worold appoyntyd
to be in that one Realm and Ilond deuydyd from all the worold by imparkyng of
the sea by natural descent of parentayge and blud, one in langayge and speech,
in form and proporcion of personayge one, one in manner and condition of living.
and thoccacion of all discord and hatred banyshyd that the godd scotishe
Englishman may confess and do the same at hom that he doothe in forene and
strange countries Calling an Englische man all ways his contreman and studious
to do him pleasure before any other Nation of the worold. The Breach of this
deuynd and Natural frendshippe is the uery work of the devil by his wyckid
members that has not tawght Scotland only disobedience unto here Natural and
Laufull prince and superior power the Kings majesty of England. But also the
contempt of Christ and his most holy word through all the worold there
iniquite and malice is fulfillid and go des mercy, Sufficiently declared for
seeing they will not repent he reuenchithe there injustice with his most
dreadful Ire not only extenuating thereforse and dyminishing there strenghe,
but also infatuatythe and turnythe into folyshnis there most prudent and
circumspect counselles. As it aperid in this batell where as god usid your
grace as amenys to your immortal renown to obtain a glorious and Celestial
uictorye against his Ennymies and youres that were not only mache and Equal in
forse with your Armey. But also treble or at the lest doble as strangers
report in Number at the first onset. Agracious and good beginning at the first
brount of your graces godly uocation unto so high honor, not only to defend
the Kings majesty's most noble person and the Realm but also to better and
perfet the crown if god will in reconsiling the unnatural and ungodly hatred.
Between too members of one body which of right and office should be as the right
hand and the leffte in peace and Amite to resist and withstand the forse of all
strange and foren assultes and uiolence. And as this uictory and triumph is to
be reyoysid at, so thend why god gave it is most diligently to be consyderyd
who yeuithe the upper hand in the worold to godly princes because his afflictyd
church should have some place to rest it self in, and the Kingdom of god to be
amplified in trewthe and uerite, theffect thereof must be folowyd that as well
the ministerye of the church be enrychid with the word of god, as the civil
Kingdom with woroldly honor. As I am assuryd your most noble grace right
well knowithe. Notwithstonding because the right of every just and Laufull here
is half lost and more when his title and cleame is unknowyn I have wroten
this little book containing what Christ is, and what his office is that every
godly man may put to, his healping hand to restore him again unto his Kingdom
and dedicatyd the same unto your Noble grace unto whom god has not only
committyd the defense of apolityke and civil Realm but also the defense of
his dear sons right Jesus Christ in the church who has susteynid open and
manifest wrong this many years as it apperithe by his Euidens and wrytinges
the gospel sealyd with his precious blud. And whereas I cannot make his cause
and right as plain as it meritithe, nor as it is decent for him that would
offer and prefer any matter to so prudent and mighty a prince: my godd will and
diligence is acceptyd of god in Christ I dout not thowghe it be uery little
that I can do and trust likewyce that for the merits of this simple and
manifest uerite your grace will pardon my bold entrepryce and accept this pore
work in god and gracious part and then it shall appear your most noble
puyssance to be coniunyd with like clemercye and mercy, the which uertewe of
all other causithe man most to resemble the almighty god that made not only
all things for his mercyes sake but likewyce with mercy over himself and
his rigorous justice also that the defaultes of mortal man might find solace
in Jesus Christ his only son^e who preserve the King his Hignis your most
noble grace with all the council and the hole Realm to the glory of god
Amen.

Tiguri 8. decembris. 1547. Your gracis most humble Orator John Hoper.

He first Capiter.
FOr asmouche as all mighty God of his infinite mercy and Goddenys preparyd
Ameanes whereby Adame and his posterite might be restoryd again unto there
Original iustite and perfection boothe of body and soul and to line eternally
unto the same end that they were created for to bliss and magnify for ever
the immortal and living God. it is thoffice of every true Christian before
all other studies, trauelles and pains that he shall sustain for the time of
this brieffe and miserable lief to apply himself with all dilige^te forse and
labor to know perfetlye this means ordeynid by God for our salvation and the
thing ons known diligently with heart soul and mind to follow the means until
souche time as theffect and end be optainid wherefore the means was appoyntid.
The means was she wyd unto Adame at his first and original transgression the
sede of awoman which should break the head of the serpent destroy the kingdom
of the devil and Restore Adame and as monye as knew and belyuyd in this sede
unto lief everlasting and as the sin of Adame thonly occacion of all man's
misery was deryuid into all his posterite and made subject unto death and the
ire of God for ever. so was this sede from the beginning aueri true and
sufficient remedy to as money as belyuid and god for his promise sake, quit and
deliueryd man from the right and cleame of the devil and by marcy restorid the
place that was by malite and co^te^pt lost he that would consider dilige^tli
these to things the sin of Adame and the marcy of God should find him self
far unable to express or sufficientli thinck the greamis of the one or of the
other. When they are so far passing the reason and undrestondyng of man. All the
solace and Joy of Adames posterite consistith soli and only in this, Romans 5.
Vbi abundauit delictum: super abundauit and gracia, the benefitis and merits
of this seade aboundith and is more avail able before the judgment of God.
then sin the flesh the devil and the worold. this treasure and in estimable
riches must beperfetly known of every person that will be sauyd it is only in
Christ and in the knolege of him what he is and what is his office.

The second Chapter: conteynythe what Christ is.
HE is the sone of the living God and perpetual uirgine Marie: Booth god and
man the true Messiah promisid unto man from the beginning of his fall. Whom
saint John callythe the word of eternal essens and divine majesty saing, In
principio erat sermo, and sermo erat apud deu^ and sermo erat deus, Joan. 1.
saint Paul ad Coloss. capite 1. Callith him the ymaige of god etc. Unto the
ebrewes cap. 1. the bryghtmis of god the creade of Nece callith him lumen de
lumine the natural sone of god in whom dwellith the fountain of all divinity
naturally as Paul says Coll. 2. in eo inhabitat plenitudo diuinitatis
corporaliter meaning that he is not the sone of god by adoption or acceptance
into grace as Abraam. David and other holy saynctes. But naturally the sone of
god equal with the father in all thi^gis as John says, Vidimus gloriam eius
tanquam unigeniti a patre cap. 1. so does saint John prove him in all his
writings to be the uery true and everlasting god and not as Ebion and
Cerinthus said that he was but uery man only, he was made mortal man as Johan
says. Et sermo ille caro factus cap. 1. est. to save the Dan^id man from
imortall death: and to be a mediator and intercessor unto god for man
Matthaei. 11. Iohannis. 3. Esaiae. 11. This scripture does not only teach usi
the knolege of salvation but does confort us against all the assaules
subtiltes and crafftes of the devil. that god would of his inestimable love,
rather suffer his only son to die for the worold, then all the worold should
peryshe. Remaining allways as he was uery god immortal receauyd the thing he
was not, the mortal nature and true flesh of man in the which he died as
peter says, 1. Pet. 4. Ireneus pagina 185. has those godly words. Christus
fuit Crucifixus and mortuus quiescente uerbo ut crucifigi and mori possit. The
deuyne nature of Christ was not rent nor torn nor kyllyd. But it obeyed the will
of the father. It gave place unto the displeasure and Ire of god that the body
of Christ might dye being all ways equal with his father he could if he had
executyd his divine pour delyueryd this body from the tyranny of the jews
these words of Ireneus does wounderfully declare unto us what Christ is and
agreith with Paul Philipp. 2. qui cum in forma dei esset: non rapinam
arbitratus est ut esset equalis deo, sed semetipsum inaniuit forma serui sumpta
seeing he was sent into the worold to suffer this most cruel death and
passion: He would do nothing that should be contrary unto his uocation but with
patience prayng for his ennymis submittyd himself unto the ignomynie and
contempt of the cross suffryng pains in^umerable without grug or murmur
against the holy will of his father: his Godhed hyding it self until the
third day when it restorid the soul again unto the body and causid it to
rysse with great triumph and glory, Roman. 1. Matthaei. 29. Ioann. 20. Luke 24.
Mar. 16. Repeting the doctrine that before his death he preachid unto the
worold. that he was booth King and lord high bishope and prist booth of heaven
and of earth. Data est mihi omnis potestas in coelo and in terra: Euntes ergo
docete omnes gentes etc. Matthew. 28. He that before was most uile and contemple
in the sight of the worold now be right and just title acclemithe the Dominion
and Empire of all the worold. how mighty a princ he is the creacion of the
worold and the preseruacion thereof declaryth hou merciful to wards them that
repent we know by daily experience in our selfs and by thexample of othere
Adam, David, Manasse and Peter. how cruel and rigurous for sin. The
ponishme^t that we suffer and the calamites of this worold declarithe specially
the death of his most innocent body. how immortal his Ire is against souch
as repent not Saul, Pharao, Judas with other declare. Ho migty and ferfull a
lord this is our savior Jesus Christ. read his title and style Nau^. 1. Where
the Prophet threthenythe the destruction of Niniue and the hole Kingdom of the
assirias: as the princes of the worold use to declare in there letters patent
of what pore forse and strenghe they be of and the names of the Realms and
dominions that they have undre there protection and governance to fere there
Ennymies that they make no resistance nor move not the peace of so might
aprince, so souch a title yeuith the Prophet unto God to fere the cite of
Niniue and Kingdom of the assiria^ce saing quid cogitatis contra Dominum? ipse
consummationem facit, nec consurgit uice altera tubulatio this is the style of
the God omnipotentour savior Jesus Christ in whois name all pores bow there
kneys in heaven in earth and in hell, Philip. 2.

Caput 3.
NOw that the scripture has taught us to know that Christ is booth god and
man. I will briuely entreat of his office ffyrst of his pryshed then of his
Kingdom and Raygne over his church till the woroldes end, then for ever in
solace with his electes, in perpetual mercy and favor: with souch as contemn
in this worold his holy commandment and pleasure in severe justice and
immortali hatred and Ire for ever Io. 3.

Saynct Paul in thepistole to the Ebrewes prouithe him to be the prist called
by god unto that function and office of the high bishope Christus non
glorificauit seipsum ut fierct Pontifex: sed is qui dixerat ei, Filius meus es
tu, ego hodie genui te, and alibi, Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem
meldizedek. Caput 5. by whose obedience unto the cross he gave everlasting
health to as many as obeyed him. And in all thingis executyd the uerij true
office of a bishope. To whom it apperteynyd to teach the people which was the
chefist part of the hishopes office and most diligently and straightly
co^maundid by God. As all the books of Moses and the Prophets teach ad Christ
commaundid Peter, Joan. 20. Paul all the bishopes and pristes of his time,
Act. 20. of Christ's authorithe and preaching. Moses and Stephin, Acto. 7.
Deuteronomy. 18. says thus Prophetam suscitabit uobis Deus uester e fratribus uestris
simi lem mei, illum audietis. He that will not harken unto his uoyce. Shall Be as
none of the people of God. This authorite to preach te father gave unto him in
the hyryng of the Aposteles, Matthew. 3. 17. and bound his church to reeeaue his
doctrine sayng this is mydere beloved sone in whom I delight hyre hyme. He
tawghe the will of his father. unto the worold and how they might be sauyd from
death infernal. Joan. 17. 6. Matthew. 11. 5. 6. 7. so that they repentyd and
beliuyd the gospel, Matthew. 3. Mar. 10. leaffte nothing untawght. But as a good
doctor manifestyd unto his audiens all things necessary for the health of
man as the woman confessyd, Ioa^. 4. Messiah cu^ uenerit docebit nos omnia. he
prechid not only himself. But sent his Aposteles an disciples to manifest unto
te worold that the acceptable time of grace was com and the sacrifice for sin
born into the worold, Matt. 10. Io. 10. and after his resurrextion. he gave
the^ co^mauadement to preche: and likwyce whatt hey should preach: Ite in
uniuersum mundum and praedicate, quae ego praecepiuobis Euangelium omni
creature, Matthew. 28. Matthew. ultimo, the which doctrine luk thus expoundithe,
poenitentiam acremissionem peccatorum in omnes gentes in nomine meo, initio
facto ab Hierosolymis, Lu ce ultim. In his name, to say in the knolege and
faith of his merits they should preche repentaynce and remission of sin unto
all the worold. As they did most syncerely and plainly without all glosses or
addicions of there own inuencion and were as testimonies of the truithe and
not the auctors thereof Act 1. 1. Joan. 1. So doothe Paul theache with grauite
and manifest words what is to be iudgyd of him self and all other ministers.
Deus erat in Christo inquit, mundum reconcilians sibi, non imputans ei precata
sua, and posuit in nobis sermonem reconciliationis. Itaque nomine Christi
legatione fungimur tanquam deo hor tante uos per nos. Rogamus pro Christo
reconciliemini deo. Always in there doctrine they tawght the thing that
Christ first tawght and gods holy sprit inspyrid them Gale. 1. 2. Cor. 3. holy
Aposteles never took upon them to be Christis uicar in the earth nor to be his
leave tenent. But said sic nos estimet homo ut ministros Christi ac
dispensatores mysteriorum dei. 1. Cor. 4. in the same Epistole he bindithe the
Corinthious to follow him in nothing but where as he folowyd Christ 11. cap.
Imitatores mei estote sicut and ego Christi. They ministryd not in the church
as thowghe Christ were absent although his most glorious body was departed
corporally into the heavens above. But as Christ present that all ways
gouernyd his church with his sprit of truithe as he promisid Matt. ult. Ecce
ego uobiscum sum usque ad co^summationem saeculi in the absence of his body, he
has commendyd the protection and governance of his church unto the holy
ghost the same god and one god with the father and his diuinae nature. Whoes
diuinae puyssanc and pour over machithe the forse of the devil so that hell it
self can not take one of Christ's flock out of gods protection Joan. 10. and
this defense dury the not for aday nor here but shall demoure for ever till this
church be glorifieyd at the resurrexion of the flesh Joan. 15. it was no
little pain that Christ suffryd in wayshing away the sins of this church.
Therefore he will not committ the defense thereof unto man: it is nolesse glory
to defend. And keep the thing won by forse then it is by for se to obtain
the uictorye. Adam, Abel, Abraham Moses nor Aron cold, not win this church
out of the deuilles tyranny. No more can they defend it delivered. For
althowghe by imputation of Christ's justice these men and all other
ffaythfulles be delyueryd from the tyranny of the devil and condemnation of
the law, yet had and has the devil his uery friends Dwelling within the
nature of man corrupt as long as he lyuithe. The concupiscence and rebellion of
man's nature who, seassythe nor day nor night to be tray man again to the
devil except with the motion of true penitence this co^cupiscens be kept under
in fere and faith which, too uertewes be so infirm in man that be he never so
perfet yet fallith he from god sometime as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and
Aron, Esa. 43. Number. 19. therefore he kepithe the defense and governance of the
church only and soly him self in whom the devil has not a yot of right
thowghe the Apostellis where instructyd in all truithe and lefft the same
wroten unto his church yet were they ministres servants testimonies and
prechers of this uerite and not Christ's Vicars in earth and leave tenent to
keep the Kayes of heaven hell and purgatory but only appoyntid to approve the
thing to be godd that gods laws commaundid* And that to be isle, that the word
of god condemnyd. Seeing that Christ doothe govern his church always by his
holy sprit and byndith all the ministers thereof unto the sole word of god. What
abomination is this that any bishope of Rome Jerusalem, antioche or else
where should accleme to be Christis uicar in therthe and take upon him to make
any laws in the church of God to bynd the conscience of man besyd the word of
God and in placyng of there supersticion and Idolatry (...) word of God out of
his place by what law by whom or where has any this title yeuen unto him to
be Gods uicar, and leave tenent upon therthe. Moses and Aron the best Princ
that ever was and most godly gouerner of the people, Aron that fide le high
pryst and preacher of Gods word never usurpyd this title to be as a second
Christ and master over men's conscience: if godly Moses and his brother Aron
never acclemyd this title in therthe doutles it is affoule and detestable
arrogance that this ungodly bishopes of Rome attribut unto them selfs to be
the hedes of Christis church the more to be lamented he that considerith there
liefe and confer it with the scripture will judge by the authorite thereof, that
they were not for this many yers worthy to be acco^ptyd any membre of godis
church But the members of the devil and the ffirst begoten of Antichrist. Thus
is true these of Rome is not only a tyranny and pestilence of body ad saul.
But the nest of all abomination god give him grace ad all his successors, to
leave there abhominacio^ and to co^ un to the light of gods word. This best is
preached unto the people to be Aman that cannot er his auctorite to be a bone
God, and his laws and to be the Prince upon the earth of all Princes but God
will judge him as he is a Murderer of booth body and Saul, and ponishe the
Princes of the worold that upp hold his abhominacion Moses and Aron by the
testimony of the scriptur never tawght but that they receauid of God and at the
last booth they offendyd. Nume. 20. in so mouch that God gave sentens against
them that none of them booth should enter into the land of promise for there
Arrogan cij and pride the text says, because ye were unfaythfull unto me: this
falce belyue was of no dout they had in the pore of God for the miracle was don
as God said. But that they attributyd to mouch unto there own pour and said:
Audite rebels, Number de petra ista nos educemus uobis aquas? For the changyng
of the therde person in this sentens in to the first. The Ire of God pronouncid
sentence of death against these too uery godly ministres of his word. The
sinnyd because they said not her ye rebellya^s cannot Ieho ua the omnipotent
give ye water of this stone, And is this (first uegoten of Antichrist the
hishope of Rome with out syn that Chaungith not only the person in a sentence
but the hole sentence ye the hole law of God and of man so that he reygnith in
the co^scie^s above the law of God and will saw him that God has damnyd and
dam ne him tat god has sauid, yet person and man of sin can not err? But he
that spared not to kyl godd Moses and Aron for thabuse of the word of god will
not ffauore this wyckid man nor none of his holy doctors at the terrible day of
judgment. Nauu^ the prophet does give god a wounderfull name which the Latin
nor the Grek cannot proporly express without circumloquution, noter huleobau,
quafi iniuriarum memoriam retinens and ulciscendi occationem expectans. He is
the god that writh all these blasphemies in his bok of remembrance and when he
hatth showed his mercy sufficiently. He reuengyth the isle that man thinkith, is
for gotten, It is of his superaboundaunt mercy that he throwithe not suddenly
fire upon the worold for sin and not that he is a sleep or cannot do it right
well iud gid Valerius maximus better the^ now the most part of Christian men,
lento quidem graduad uindictam sui proce dit diuina ira. Sed grauitate
supplicij tarditatem compensabit. Because god has yeuen this light unto my
country men which be all persuadyd or else God send them to be persuadyd that
the bishope of Rome nor none other is Christ's uicar upon therth it is none de
to use any long or copious oracion it is so plain that it nedith no probacion
the ueri proprietes, of Antechrist I mean of Christ great and principal
ennimie is so openly known to all men that are not blyndyd with the smoke of
Rome. that they know him to be the best that Johan descrybyth in the Pocalipse,
as well as the logitio^ knowith that risibilitate distinguitur, homo a caeteris
animantibus. This knoleig of Christ's supremite and continual presence in the
church admyttyth no leave tenent nor general uicar. likewice it admittithe
not the decrees and laws of men browght into the church contrary unto the
word and scripture of God which is only sufficient to teach all uerite and
truth for the salvation of man as it shall apere in this Capiter following.

Caput IIII.
CHrist the only light of the worold sent from his father and born mortal mann
according unto the scripture began to theache the word of God purelli and
sincerly unto the worold and chose ministres and Apostelles convenient for
thexpedicion thereof and approuyd to be the uery Messiah by God the father Mat.
3. 17. Joan. 5. tawght his disciples the truith by the only law. Wroten by
Moses and the prophets and not by unwrytyne uerites. And in all contrauersis
and dout full questions, he ausweryd his contrarijs by the word of god, in that
wonderful temptation of the devil Matt. 4. by collation of the places of
scripture he killyd the devil with his own sword: falsely, and in a wrong
sentence aleging the word of god by the word of god godly applied. When his
disciples were reprehendid by the Pharisees as breakers of the sabbath Matt. 12.
He excusyd there fact by the law. Non legistis quid fecerit David, and qui cu^
eo erant, so lik wyce Matt. 15. 19. in all contrauersys he made the law judge
between his Ennymis and him. When he was desyrid to teach ayong man the way to
heaven and to cu^ to eu^ lasting lief he said in lege quid scriptum est, quomo
do legis? Matt. 22. lik wice the Saduces that denied the resurrexion of the
ded. Erratis inquit nescientes scripturas and uerbum dei. The Rych man in hell
that was so desirous that his brothers living in therthe might have knolege,
and warning to beware they were not damnyd in time to cum would gladly have
warnid them himself for a more suretye Luc. 16. that the messayge should be
done. Abraam Answered, habent Mosen and prophetas audientillos, the scripture
teachith what heaven hell, and what man is, and what Christ is therefore Christ
send dith us theter Io. 5. scrutamini inquit scripturas. Again being requirid
in a civil matter concerning tribute and obedience unto the princes of the
worold Matt. 22. he said. Reddite quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, and quae sunt dei
deo. Give unto the emperor that that is deu unto the emperor and unto god that
that is deu unto god. And under the Nam of the emperor he undrestondith, all
superior poures apoyntid over the people by god. And would to give dew honor
unto them booth as Paul teachite Romans 13. 1. Pet. 2. this law teachith man
sufficiently as well what he is bound to do unto god as unto the princes of the
worold nothing can be desyrid necessari for man but in this law it is
prescribid. Of wbat degree uocation or calling so ever he be his dewty is shewid
unto him in the scripture. And in this it differith from man's laws because
it is absolute perfeit and never to be Chaungid. Nothing addid unto it nor
taken from it. And the church of Christ the more it was and is burdenyd with
mannis laws the farther it is from the true and sincere uerite of gods word.
The more man presumith and takith authorite to interpretat the scripture after
his own brain and subtle wytt, and not as the uerite of text requirith the
more he dishonorith the scripture and blasphemith god thauctor thereof. It is
the office of a good man to teach the church as Christ tawght, to revoke all
Errors and souch as Er unto the fold of Christ only by the word of Christ.
For the water at the foyntaynce head is more halsom and pure then when it is
caryd abroad in roten pypes or styn king diches. I had rather follow the shadow
of Christ then the body of all general conselles or doctors since the death of
Christ. The deuille never slept but allways by his ministres attemptyd to
destroy the uerite of Christ's relligion and clean to put out the ligth of
truithe. Which was perfet in Christ's time and in the time of the Apostelles.
Nonne since that time so pure. Saynct hieromein uita malchi says that his time
was darkenys in the respect of the Apostelles time.

The antiquite of the worold does darken the uerite of gods word. As Varro
says truith uetustatem multa deprauare. Multa etiam tollere. Et tercium
seculum (inquit) non uidet eum hominem quem uidit primum. The truith of gods
uerite the more it is usidd, practysid and taught aster the wisdom of man the
more is the glory and perfection thereof darkenyd it is the contrary in all
Humane arts as Cicero says in humanis, nihil simul inuentum and perfectum
fuit, usuque and exercitatione factum sit: Vt hoc praestantiores arts quaedam
fuerint quo longius ab origin sua and inuentoribus essent deducte. The church
of god must therefore be bound to none other authorite the^ unto the uoyce of
the gospel and unto the ministry thereof as Esa says cap. 8. Obsigna legem in
discipulis meis. the Prophet spekith of souch darkenis as should follow his time
conserning the coming of Messiah the true Doctor of the church therefore prayed
to preserve the true here is of the Prophets and that it would pleac him to
confirm the doctrine of truth in there hearts lest the word and true
undrestonding of the word by the deuille should be put out and seeing the church
is bound unto this infallible truith the only word of God it is a false and
usurpyd authorite that men attribute unto the clerge and bynd the word of God
and Christis church to the succession of bishops or any coleige of
Cardinals Scoles minystres or Cathedral churches, Paul would noman to give
faith to any person, or minystre in the church of God but when he preachith the
word of God trewli, Gal. 1. Men may have the gyfft of God to undrestond and
interpretat the scripture unto other. But never authorite to interpretat it,
other wise then it interpretatithe it self which the godly mind of man by
study meditacion and conferryng of one place thereof with the other may find
how be it some more some less as God yeuith his grace. For the ponyshement of
our sins God leuithe in all men a great imperfection and souche as were
induyd with excellent wytt and lernyng saw not always the truithe. As it is

thowghe they stayed them selfs in the knolege of Christ and Erryd not in any
Principal article of the faith yet, they did inordinatly and more then
Inowghe extolle the doctrine and tradicion of men. and after the death of the
Apostellis every doctors time was subject unto souche ceremonye and man's
decrees, that was nether profetable ner necessari. therefore diligently exortyd
Paul the church of Christ principalto consider and regard the fundacion of
all ueryte Menyng that Doctors of the chnrche had there imperfection and
faults. Fundamentum (inquit) non potest poni aliud praeter id quod positum
est, quod est Jesus Christus. In the se few words is stablyshe al our faith
and all false religion reprehendyd upon this foundation sommen buld gold to say
godly and necessari doctrine as Policarpus that confutyd the he resy of marcion
de essencia Dei. of the causis of sin that the devil and man is the cause of
sin and not god nor fatal destiny, nor the influens or respects of the
planetes. He meynteinid the true religion of god and gouernyd the church, As
the scripture tawght which he lernyd of Johan evangelist and defendyd this
truith with wou^derfull co^sta^ce and martyrdo^ Basilius and many other
reteynid the articles of the faith but they institutyd the lieffe and rule off
monks and preferryd that kind of lief before the lief of souche as govern in
the comune wealth the people of god. and persuadyd men that souche kind of
lieffe was auery deuyne and acceptable honoryng of god. After him folowyd
souche as augmentid this isle and said it was not only acceptable unto God but
also: that men might deserve therwithe remission of sin. thus alitle and
alitle the devil augmentid supersticion and deminyshyd the truth of Gods
glory so that we se no where the church of Christ as it was in the Apostelles
time thowghe mani and godly uerites has been browght unto light in our time by
men of diverse graces yet is not the truithe of necessary uerites plainly
sheuyd by them lest man should to mouche glory in himself he permyttyd them to
ar in certain points. As Luther of ablyssyd memory. which wrote and preachyd
the gospel of iustificacion noma^ better yet in the cause of the sacrament he
arrithe concerning the corporal precens of Christ's natural body that there
is no man can ar more. I shall have occasion to writ the truith concerning this
matter herafter it is no reproach of the did man. but mine opinion unto all the
worold that the scripture soly and the Apostelles church is to be folowyd and
nomans authorite. Be he Augustine, Tertullian, or other Cherubim or Cherabim.
unto the rules and Canones of the scripture must man trust and reform his
errores thereby. or else he shall not reform him self but rather deform his
conscience. The church of the Romans, Corin thio^s and other. the seven
churches that Ioa^. writithe of in the Apocalipses were in all things reformyd
unto the rule and form prescribyd by the everlasting God the ymayge of these
churches I always prynt in my mind. And where so ever I com I lok how nere
they resemble the before rehersid and whether there prechers preach simple
without dispensation of any part of gods most necessary word. And whether all
the occatious of Idolatre be taken away as ymagy ce whom Gregori callith the
books of the lay men thowghe this title be against the second commandment and
never approuid bythold testament nor the new ^y word or examplewhere as
thoccacion is not remouid the word of god must needs stand in haserd for god
will not, Say the wysdom of man what it list have his church pesteryd with any
kind of Idolatry: and to make god and the devil agree in one church it is
impossible. Saynct John has wounderfull words in the Apocalippes cap. 3.
Unto the church of laodicensium scio opera tua, quia neque frigidus neque
feruidus: Vtinam frigidus esses aut feruidus itaque quoniam tepidus es and nec
frigidus nec feruidus incipiam te euome re de ore meo. These words aruero
necessary to be bonr in mind. For he that is nether hot nor cold, But
indifferent to use the kolege of gods word and Christ's church, with the
word and gloss of man that teachith the use of ymagys in te church, before he
can prove by tauctorite of gods word that they may besuffryd in the church
doothe not well, they have been thoccacion of greathurt and Idololatrye the
church of the old testament nor the new never tawght the people with ymagys.
Therefore it shall be the office of every man that louithe god and his word to
follow the scripture only. And to be wayle the ignorancy of souche as has
before our time or now in our time by words or writing defend the same. And
with all humilite and humblenys submitt himself to the iudgmet and Censure of
the judge of all Iugdes the word of god that he may wisely and godly dissern
what is to be belyuid and acceptyd of any doctors wrytinges, and what is not to

perils and dangers of other lern to be wise that we commit not the same

should say an image prouokyth devotion. holy waterteachith that the blud of
Christ was sprynklyd for my sins the holy bread teachith that Christ's body

Christ that died for our sakes would not his death to be prechid this way. but
out of the scripture by the tongue of man and not out of the decrees of Bishopes
by adrop of water or peyntyd post he that tok the pains to die and suffer his
passion for te rede^tion of the worold soly and only. soly and only has taken
the pains to teach the worold how and which wai they should keep this passion
in mind and lefft it unto the worold in writing by the hands of his holy
Aposteles unto the which wreting only he has bound and obligatyd his church
and notto the wretings of men. In this passaige I admonish the Christian
reader that I speak not of the laws of magistrates or princes that daili
ordey ne new laws for the preseruacion of there comune wealth as they se the
necessite of there Realms or cites require. But of souche laws as men has
ordeinid for the church of Christ which should be now and for ever gouernyd by
the word of God. In this cause look as eve offendid obeyng the persuacion of
the devil contrary unto the commandment of God so doothe every man offend
obeyng any laws or decrees, that commaundithe any thing contrary unto the
word, of God. This law must prevail, Oportet Deo magis obedire quam hominibus.
The exampleherof we have in Daniel of the three children that chose reather to
burn in the fiery furny se then to worshipp The ymiage that Nabucadneser had
made. so did the Aposteles Act. 5. let all the worold consider whether these
laws of the Bishopes the Mass which is a profanation of Christ's supper to
bynd me^nes conscience to pray unto did saynctes, to say Imagis be to be suffryd
in the temples and constrayne the ministres of the church to live sole

in obeyng these laws then Eve did in obeyng the uoyce of the serpent. the
wysdom of all the wits in the worold cannot comprehend the greatnys of this
isle. make what laws they will for the body so the leave the conscience fre, with
patience it is to be suffryd: only I lament the bondayge of the conscie^s
cursyd be these that make souche laws, and cursyd be those that with
sophistry defend them that parasitus and bond man of the bishope of Rome
pigius in his writi^ges shamith not to say it is less sin for a prist to
keep an other mannis wief then to have a wiefe of his own. Conserning acts

may be more ardent and the mind more yeuen to study and prayer doothe well and
as they be bound to do, and to com unto the temple to pray for them selfs and
the church of Christ and to hyre the word of god doothe well for as god
commaundithe his word to be preachyd and hard so he has apoyntid a certain
time as the sabbothe whenpeople should hyre it. And not only this order to be
obseruid in the church but also in every familye and household of what degree so
ever he be He should cause his family and children to read some part of the
Bible for there erudition to know god. Likwy ce he should constrayne them to
pray unto god for the promocion of his holy word and for the preseruacion of
the gouerners of the commune wealth so that no day should pass witheout
prayer, and augme^tacion of knolege in the religion of Christ. But our new
Evangelists has an other opinion they dream of faith that justifies the
which nether repentaynce presedithe nether honesty of lyffe folowithe which
shall be to there doble damnacio^ if they amend not. He that will conform his
knolege unto the word of god let him likwyce convert his Itef with all as the

else what will he do with the doctrine of Christ which only teachith and
sufficiently teachithe all uerite and uerrewes lief let him tarry style in the
doctrine of man and live as manly and as carnally as he list and not profess
to know god nether his trewthe rather then, so to slander them boothe. This
sufficithe to proves only word of god to be sufficient to teach the truithe.
All other men's laws, to be nether necessary nether profetable. and certain
we be that the church of the Apostelles did waunt these decrees, that papistre

Caput V.
THe second office of Christ is to pray and to make intercession for his
people. This office Johan wrytithe of in his first epistole, if any man sin
we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ that makithe intercession for
us. And as Paul says. Christus qui mortuus est, imo qui and suscitatus, qui
etiam est ad dexteram dei, qui and intercedit pro nobis, in his name and in the
belyue and co^fidens of his meritis we may obtain the mercis of god and liffe
ever lasting as Paul say the* Accedamus cum fiducia ad tronum graciae, ut
consequamur misericordiam and gratiam inueniamus ad oportunum auxilium, Ebre.
4. this intercession of Christ only sufficithe no man should secke any other
mediator of intercession or expiacion of sin as Paul says declaring the
sufficiency and abilite of Christ's death and intercession Christus manet in
aeternum, perpetuum habens sacerdocium: Vnde and saluos facere ad plenum potest
qui per ipsum adeunt deu^ semper uiuus ad hoc ut interpellet pro illis. Unto
this intercession and prayer in Christ's name he bound his church by express
commandment. Petite and accipietis. Ask and yt shall be yeuen you. and in the
same place he shewithe the cause wherefore it shall be yeuen. Quicquid petieritis
patrem in nomine meo, dabit uobis, What so ever ye ask in the belyue and
confidence of my merits it shall be yeuen unto you saint Paul, callith Christ
Sytting at the right hand of god the minister and servant of the saynctes to
say of souche as be here living in this troblyd and persecutyd church to
solicitat and do all there affars as a faithful Ambassador with the father of
heaven until the consummacion of the worold this doctrine of Christ's
intercession must be all ways diligently preachyd unto the people, and like
wyce that in all necessites calamites and troble the afflictyd person to syke
none other means to offer his prayers unto God but Christ only according as
the scripture teachithe, and as we have example of holy saynctes in the same.
Not only in the new testament were as he co^maudithe us to pray in his name,
and Stephin in his martyrdom, Acto. 7. commendid his sprit unto this only
mediator sayng domine Jesus: Accipite Spirituu^ meum, But also in the ole
Testament thus prayed the patriarks and Prophetis Jacob, Ge^. 48. benedicat
pueris istis Deus and Angelus qui eripuit me de cu^ctis malis. and David Psalm.
71. Et adorabu^t ipsum semper. For asmouche as Christis daily in heaven and
praythe for his church the church of Christ must pray, as Christ has
towght it, As the Patriarchs, Prophets and the Aposteles has yeuen us
example whic never prayed unto ded saynct. ye as Christ has yeue^ us example
hangyng in the cross saing pater in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum. What
intolerable, I Will, blasphemy of God and Etnycall Idolatry is this to admit
and teach the inuocacion of sanctes departed out of this worold. it takythe
from God his true honor it makythe him a foul that only has ordeynid only
Christ to be mediator betwe^ man and him, it dyminyshithe the merits of
Christ takythe from the law of god here perfection and Majesty where as God
has openid his will and pleasure unto the worold in all things. It
conde^nithe the old church of the Patriarchs and Prophetis likewyce the
church of the Aposteles and Martyrs that never thawght thinuocacion of
saynctes. It accufithe the scripture of God to be false which says thou
shall nether ad nether dymynishe any thing it makith Christ alyer that said,
Spiritum quem ego mittam a patre, docebituos omnem ueritatem. If the men that
teach sancta Maria ora pro nobis. Be more holy then all the Pratriarches or
Prophets and Aposteles let the conscience of the Christia ne reader judge. This
distinction of mediators. To be one of expiacion for sin Christ: and an
other of intercession the saynctes departed is nawght: it repugnythe the
manifest text of the scripture. It is the office only of Christ to be the
mediator for sin, and like wyce to offer the prayers of the church to his
father. Joan. 1. Ecce agnus dei, qui tollit peccata mundi, as concerning
intercession he commendithe us only to ask in his name. And prescribid the
manner how to ask, and what to ask Luce 11. souche as say if the saynctes that
we pray unto here us not ner profet adee, lyet it hindrithe notwe loost but our
labor. this mouche it hindrth it declarithe him that praythe to be aninfidele.
To pray unto that god or gods that is not able to healpe him nor hyre his
prayer and no better the^ he that prayed unto the imayge of iubiter in creta
that had nether yares nor yees. It declarithe him to contemn boothe god and
his word who assurithe every man in every time and in every distress not only
to hyre him but also to give ayede. Mat. 11. so now this worshiper of saynctes
departithe from the known and all mighty god to an unknowen god, and
preferrith the doctrine of man and the devil before the scripture of truithe
and the lyui^g god. I hope this detestable error is cum to light and almen
tawght to pray as the scripture Canonical teachethe. But there is an other isle
as great as this to be reprehendyd of all souche as know how to pray a right.
the benig of ymagis in the temple which the worold says may be suffryd in
the churches. And say they be godd to put the people of God in remembrance of
souche godly saynctes as died for Christ's sake. But this is always the
subtylty of the devil. when a manifest isle cannot be born withal, to syk a
gloss and interpretacion that where ash cannot walk in the church openly
like a devil, and have candelles, styctkyd before apost, and the ymayges
kissyd, yet to desire som^e man to put a fere Cote upon his bake, that he may
have a place in the church to lurk in until souche time as occation be
ministryd to show himself again as he is. The auctorite of Gods word
requirithe me to pronounce this true iudgmet in the cause of ymagyes that be
not worshippid in the church that there presence in the church is against
gods word as well as to say: Sancta Maria ora pronobis, and as the on is to be
eschewyd and banishid our of the heart so is the other out of the yye in the
temple where as gods word is preachid unto the people and the sacraments
ministryd. thus I prove by the authorite of boothe Testamentes. The old and the
New the old says thou shall make no ymayge, Exodus 20. Deu. 6. in the New
there is nomencion made of any ymayge. But that Christ concerning the law and
precepts of the commandments said: Non ueni soluere legem, sed adimolere,
Matthew. 5. For asmouche as Christ lefft the commandments of the old law unto
the church in the which he says thou shall not make any ymagye. From whens
has this men authorite that say if ymagys be not honorid they may be suffrid
in the church it is but there opinion contrary and besyd the law of god. and
this commandment non facies, no^ coals, for byddith as well the making of the
ymayge as the honoring of it: Conserning the having of them in the place of
puplik prayer and use of his Sacraments. Souch as would this occacio^ of
Idolatry to remain in the church by division of the commandments would
pass over this second commandment which says: Non facies tibi sculptile,
non adorabis ea, and make of the tenthe commandment to commandments. But
the text will not suffer it. For as the lord there for biddyth the inward lust
and concupistencence of his neigbors house so does he for bid the lust and
concupiscence of his neygbours wiefe servant, Or dawghter and all is but one
commandment Exo. 20. read the text in the Ebrew and then it shall be more
plain. The second commandment which the defenders of ymagyce neglect. For
bydith not only the outward reverence and honor but also by the same express
commandment for biddith to make any ymayge they do injuries to the manifest
text and there gloss is to be abhorrid. And the plain text to be folowyd. The
Kings majesty that ded is willyd not only all his true subjects to have no
familiarite with Cardinal poule, but also to refrain his company and not to
have to do with him in any case and not without godd and necessary
co^syderation he that would: not with stonding this command, of the kyngis
majesty, have hauntyd Poules company, and at the time of his accusation have
said he was not with poule for frendshid, nor familiarite to do him any honor
but hauntyd his company with souch other persons as meant no isle to the Kings
majesty or his Realm doutles this law should of right and equite condemn him
(nether for frendishippe, nether oder cause no man should use his company)
Doutles as the Kings mayesti and every other prince knowith it to be dangerous
dayli to suffer his subjects in the company of his treatorous Ennymies so God
knew right well what danger it was to suffer man his creatur to have company
with those ydoles and therefore said thou shall nether worship them ner make
them. All the princes of there the has not had somany subjects betrayed and
made traitors by there Ennymyes, as God has loost sowles by the meanys of
imagis I make all the worold judge that knowithe the truithe. It is so childs
an opinion to say that ymagys may be suffryd in the church so they be not
honoryd, that it nedithe no probacion at all the gentilles that Paul speakithe
of, Roman. 1. knew right well that the idol was not God. And all the Idolatres
that usid ymagies that the new Testament speakyth of 1. Co. 5. and 10. 1. Pet.
4. 1. Ioa^. 5. kew right well that these ymagys of gold or silver was not the
devil that they worshippyd. The apostes condemnyd not only there false
religion but also there ymagis. Johan by express words callithe the ymayge,
Idolatrye and byddith them beware of ymagis sayng cauete a simulachris David
Psalm. 114. say the Idola gentium argentum and aurum he condemnithe not only
there false religion but also the ymagis made by the hand of man. Which were of
gold and silver. There false god was nether gold nether silver. But awyckid
sprit who had entrid for lack of faith in to there sprites. It is to be
lamented that god for our sins thus suffrythe the worold to be illudid by the
devil. Of late yers the imagies were in the temple and honoryd with pater
noster, heart and mind With leg and kne. This use of ymagis is taken away in
many places. But now they be applied to an other use, scilicet to teach the
people, and to be the lay men's books. As damascene and many other says. Oh
blasphemous and deuillis he doctrine to apoynt the most noble creature of god
man endued with wit and reason, resembling the ymayge of the ever lasting god
to be instructyd and tawght of a mute. Domme blind and ded Idol: the brut best
that goithe by the way, and the Ass that seruithe for the mill is not tawght
by the rod of the Carter, But by the prudens of him that usithe the rod. And
should those pentyd blocks be the books of reasonable man? full well can the
devil transform himself into an angel of light. And to deceive the people
under the pretenc of true religion. I had rather trust to the shadow of the
church that the scripture theachite, then to all the me^nes writing sith the
death of Policarp 9. Christ says not go preach unto the people by ymagis.
But said: Ite in uniuersum mundum, and praedicate euangeliu^, Matthew. 28. They
say that ymagys adorn and semely deek the temple of God whether as people
resort to hyre the word of god the more ymagys, the more dishonoryd is the
temple First let them teach by the manifest word of God that the temple should
be deckid with souche ydoles that cannot teach nor speak some man's tongue
must declare the history of the Idol or else they know not what the ydole is
parauenture take sanct Barbara for saynct Katheryn. And saynct co^cumbre, for
the rode of Paul's: Balaam and his ass that for lucre attemptid to curse the
church of god, for Christ and his Ass that came to bliss and sanctify his
church with his precious biud: it is thabuse and prophanacion of the temple to
suffer them, and a great occation for people to return to there acustomyd isle.
I would all men should indifferently poundre these reasons and judge whether
they be to be suffryd or not. First the most perfeite churches of the
prophets, Christ and his Apostelles usyd no souche mean to instruct the
people. We owght to follow them and the word of god wroten by the prophetis and
Apostelles. Also the greak church never consentyd willyngly to admit the use
of imaiges in the temples, the isle that has happened unto the, people by the
means of imagis is to plain and well known, god by Idolatry robbid of his
glory and the Idolater disheretyd of gods mercy except he repentyd in this
lief, an imayge ons browght into the church, lyuithe along time, grant that
at the beginning there was agodd preachet of the church, The preacher diethe,
the idol the longer it liuithe the younger it waxithe, as ye may se by the
ydole of walsingha^. Cantorbury and hayles the florishyd most alitle before
there desolation in the raygne of the Kings majesty that ded is henry the
viij. of Ablyssid memori. at there setting uppe I suppose the preachers were
more diligent and zealous of gods glory then afterward. But was not the
original damnable, against the word of god to give the people souche aboke to
lern by, that should scole the^ to the devil? The words of Gregory ad Serenum
Episcopum Massilien^. part 10. Epistol. 4. shuldmoue Noman towgh he say quod
legentibus scriptura: Hoc ideotis pictura praestat cernentibus. And doothe
reprehend serenus for the breakyng of ymagyes sayng that the like was not seen

writithe in a certain Epistole ad Iohannem Hierosolimitanum Episcopum.
Interpret D. Hieronymo has this sentence: Audiui quosdam murmurare contra

Paul commaundithe, 1 Thessalonians. 5. this Doctor as all men knowithe was of
singular lerning and uer tew Again against thauctorite of Gregori the great. I
set the auctorie of Athanasius the great. Who denyyth by express words the

Philosophi gentium, and qui apud eos eruditi dicuntur, cum urgeri a nobis
coeperint, non negant hominum and mutorum animalium formas atque effigies esse,

Tertullia^ de corona militis iudgith the same: the law of God doothe not only

the art of grauyng and pentyng is the yefft of God, to have the picture or

hankyd not the picture of his body upon the cross to theache them his death
as our late lernyd men has done. The plowghman be he never so unlernyd,
shall better be insructyd of Christ's death and passion by the corn that he
sowithe in the fyld and likwyce of Christ's resurrextion, then be all the
dedpostes that hang in the church or pullyd out of the sepulcher with,
Christus resurgens. What resemblaynce has the taking of the cross out of the
sepulcher and goying a prossession with it with the resurrexcion of Christ:
none at all, the ded post is as ded, when they sing, iam non moritur, as it
was, when they buryd it, with, in pace factus est locus eius. If any preacher
would manifest the resurrexcion of Christ unto the senses. Why doothe not he
teach tem by the grain of the fyld, that is rysyn out of the Earth, and
commithe of the ded corn, that he sawid in the winter. Whidoth not the preacher
preach the death and resurrextion of Christ, by souche fiqures and metaphors
as the scripture teachith Paul wounderfully 1. Co. 15. Prouith with arguments
the death and resurrextion of Christ's and ours like wyce that nothing may be
more plainly tawght, a ded post caryd a prosession as mouch resemblyth the
resurrextion of Christ As uery death resemblyth lief, people should not be
tawght nor by ymayge nor by relics as Erasmus Rothorodam in his 3. book of
Ecclesiastes well declarithe. Lactanci us Firmianus usyth a wounder deuyne,
eloquent, and plain manner in the declaring of this resurrextion which is song
yerly in the church, De resurrectionis dominice die with mani godli and divine
uerses. The same Lactancius says that there can be no true religion where
these ymagis be. Augustad Mercellu^ reprehendithe them wounderfully in these
words of Dauyd os habent and non loquuntur. seythe men may be son decreauid by
imagis likwyce in the first book de consensueuangelistaru^. Souche as defend
them have nothing but sophistical arguments to blind the people with the
scripture nor Apostelles church usyd none as for Gregory the great and
Theodosius with other that defend them, all the historis declare that me^ of
greater lerni^g then they by the scripture condemnyd them as leo 3. the emperor.
Constantinus 5. Who assemblyd all the lernid men of Asia and Graecia and
condemnyd, the use of imagis that Gregory and Martine the first had stablishid
but it forsith not, had all Asia, Africa and Europa and Gabriel tharchangell
descendyd from heaven approuid the use of imagis, for asmouch as the Apostelles
nether tawght, nor wrote of them there authorite should have no place, the word
of god soly and only is to be preferrid Galat. 1. which for byddith imagys.

Caput VI. The third office of Christ is concerning his prysthade to offer
sacrifice unto god and by the same to purge the worold from sin.
Paul Phillip. 2. says that Christ humblyd him self unto death, of the
cross ad Ebre. 2. he was made part taker of man's mortal nature, that by
death he might destroy him that had the imperie and dominion of death to say
the devil. Johan callith him the lamme, that do the take away the sin of the
worold loan. 1. all the sacrifice of the old law were figures and types of this
only sacrifice which was appoyntid by god to die and to suffer their and
displeasure of god for the sin of man as thowghe he him self were asynner
and had merry tid this displeasure, the greatnis of this Ire, sorrow, confusion,
ignominy and contempt, nether angel, ner man can express: his pains were so
intolerable and his passion so dolorous, his deite so obedient with the
fathers will, that it was not only a sacrifice, but also a just recompense, to
satisfye for all the worold soly and only as Christ tawght Nicodemus Joan. 3.
as Paul Ebre. 7. 8. 9. 10. Esa. 53. and so all the prophets and patriarchs:
and souch a sacrifice as ons for all sufficithe Ebre. 7. these too officies of
Christ should never be out of remembraynce They declare the infinite mercy of
god and likewyce his indifferent and egall justice unto all creatures without
respect of persons. The token of his mercy may be knoyn in this that he would
not that all man kind should be loost, though in Adam, all deseruyd eternal
death he opened his mercy unto Adam not only by word but also by the fire that
descendyd upon his sacrifices and his sons so to Abraam, then to the worold
by the incarnacion and death of his only son, the promise of grace and the
promis of ever lasting lief unto souche as repent and belyue in him. The signs
of his Ire and displeasure unto man is this that he would not accept man again
into his favor, for no penence, no sorrow, no troble, no aduersite, no weping
no wayling, no nor for the death of oni person Until his own son most dear
belouid by death appeced his displeasur and be came suerty to satiffye the
justice of God and the right that the devil had unto ull mankind. This if man
remembryd as depely and as ernestly as the matter requirithe, it should make his
hartfull sorry and brig him unto an honest and uertews trade of lyffe. To
consider this example of Gods justice and equite in the appesing of his own
just conceuyd Ire, and lik wyce that he would do no wrong unto his mortal
Ennymy the devil except the sone of god had been an aequall and just redemption
a price correspondent to contrepece and satisfy the culpe and gilt of man's
sin, God would not have taken one soul from the right and justice of the
devil. Now of this infallible truithe that Christ has sacrifici only for
sin, and his death acco^ptid only sufficient for the salvation of man. The
church of Christ is aryght iustructyd of to most necessary articles. First
of iustificacion, and then of the right use of the sacrament of his holy body
concerning justification thus the word of God theachith.

Caput VII.
Saint Paul when hesaithe that we be justified by faith, Romans 3. 4. 5. he
menythe that we have remission of sin, reconciliacion and acceptance into
the favor of God so doothe this word justify signify, Deuteronomy. 25. hisdich where
as God co^mau^dithe the judge to justify quit and absolve the innocent, and to
condemn and punish the person culpable.

Paul says we or iustied by faith, and not by works: to be justified by
faith i Christ is asmouche to say as we obtain remission of sin and ar
acceptyd into the favor of god by the merits of Christ. to be iustied by
works is asmouche to say, as to deserve remission of sine by works. Paul
declarythe that for the death and merits of Christ we be sauyd, and not by
our own uertewes so that faith doothe not only show us Christ that died and
now sittithe at the right hand of God, but also applyythe the merits of this
death unto us and makyth Christ ours, faith layng nothing to gayge unto the
justice of God but the death of Christ and there upon clemythe marci and Gods
promise the remission of sin. and desyrythe God to iustyfye, and deliver the
soul from the accusacion of the law and right of the devil. which he is
bound to do for his promise sak. Ezech. 33. Matthew. 17. and altowghe with this
remission of sin he yeuithe like wice. the holy ghost to work the will of
God, to love boothe God and his neyghbowr not withsto^ding, the conscience
burdenyd and chargyd with sin: first sekythe remission thereof. For this thing
the conscience laborythe, and contendithe in all feres and terrors of sorrow
and co^trycion it disputithe not what uertewes it bringith wreachid soul to
accleme this promis of mercy but for sakyng here own justice ofrithe Christ,
ded upon the cross and sitting at Gods right hand, Nothing makithe it the
cause wherefore this mercy should be yeuen saving only the death of Christ which
is ton litron the only sufficient price and gayge for sin. And althowghe it
be necessary and requysyt that in the justification of a sinner contricion to
be present and that necessaryly cherite and uertews lieffe most follow, yet
does the scripture attribute thonly remission of syn^e unto the mercy of god
wliche is yeuyne only for the merits of Christ and receauid soly by faith,
Paul doothe not Exclude, those uertewes to be present, but he excludith the
merits of these uertews and deryuithe the cause of our acceptance in to the
grace of god only for Christ. And Mark this manner of speech, fide
iustificamur. Hoc est fiducia misericordie sumus iusti. This word faith, does
co^prehe^d as well a perswacion and confidence, that the promese of god
appertaynith unto him for Christ's sakeas the knolege of god. for faith thowghe
it desire the company of Contricion and sorrow for sin, yet contendith it not
in iudgmen, upon the merits of no works but only for the merits of Christ's
death in case it did, it auaylithe nothing. For if a aman desire to be
delyu^id from the law, the law must be satisfied. Which says diliges do
minum deum tuum ex tota mente toto cord, and ex omnibus uiribus. Deuteron. 6.
Now there is nor never was any man born of the stoke of Adame in original
sin that feryd god asmouche as the law requirithe nor never had souche
constant faith as is requiryd, nor souche ardent love as it requirithe: seeing
those uertewes that the law requiryd: be infirm and debile, for there merits
we can obtain nothing of god, we must therefore only trust to the merits of
Christ, which satisfied the extreme jot and uttermust point of the law for us
and this his justice and perfection he imputithe and co^municatithe with us by
faith: souche as say that only faith iustifiethe not, because other uertewes
be present: they cannot tell what they say: every man that will have his
conscience appesyd most Mark those too things. How remission of sin is
optaynid: and wherefore it is optaynid faith is the mean whereby it is
optaynid: and the cause wherefore it is receuid is the merits of Christ:
althowgh faith by the means whereby it is receauid yet has nether faith ner
cherite, ner contricion, ner the word of god nor all those knyt to gather
sufficient merits wherefore we should obtain this remission of sin. But the
only cause wherefore sin is for yeuing is the death of Christ Now Mark the
words of Paul ffrely says he wear justified by his grace. Let the man byrst
his heart with contricion, belyue that god is godd athowsand times, burn in
cherite, yet shall not all these satisfy the law nor deliver man from the Ire
of god until souch time as faith lettithe fall all hope and confidence in the
merits of souche uertewes as be in man, and say lord behold thy unfrutefull
servant, only for the merits of Christ's blud give me remission of sins for
I know no man can be justified other wyce beforethe as David says: Non
iustificabitur in conspectu tuo omnis uiuens, Psalm. 143. again, Beatus uir cui
Dominus non imputat peccatum, Psalm. 32. He that would mark Christ's
communication with that Noble man and great Clerk Nicodemus, Joan. 3. Should be
satisfied how and wherefore man is justified, so plainly that no adversary of
the truithe should hurt this infallible uerite sole faith to justify.
Nicodemus having a good opinion althow not a sufficient knolege of Christ. Came
unto him by night and confessyd him to be sent from God, and that because of
souche works and miracles as he had wrowght. Christ made answer Trewly
Nicodemus Isay unto the Noman can se the kyngdon of God except he be born from
a boue Nicodemus not undrestonding what Christ meant, Askid him how an old man
could be born again, and whether he could enter his mothers belie, and then be
born again. Christ bringithe him yet ner unto the light that he might know
the means and says I tell the treuly Nicodemus that noman can enter the
kyngdon of God Except he be born of the water and the holy ghost etc. Nicodemus
confessyd yet again his ignorancy, and desired to be father instructyd sayng.
How may these things be. Christ answerid. Thou art the great Master and Rabbi
in Israel and yet ignorant of these things Meaning that great and horrible
must the ignorancy of the people be: when there doctors know not the trewthe.
Nicodemus confessing his ignorancye, and receiving reproach at Christ's hand,
because he took upon him to teach other and yet a fool him self in the
religion of god. Might for shame have left Christ and his gospel yke, because
he now is made a scholar that before was for his prudence and lerning the
cheffe of the Jews. A pharise of most notable estimacion. Christ straight way
confortithe him all other lernid and unlernid, and says. Noman ascendithe
into heaven, Except he that descendyd from heaven, the son of man Which is
in heaven as thowghe Christ had said thus: discomfort not thy self Nycodemus
that althowghe thou be agreat lernyd man and yet ignorant of the ways unto
ever lasting lief: for I promise the there is noman lernyd nor unlernid, that
can of his own wit and lerning ascend unto the knolege of lief ever lasting
but only he that descendyd from heaven the sone of man which is in heaven. Now
Nicodemus being destitute of all worldly and humane prudence and fynding him
self full unhable by wytt or lerning to follow theffect of Christ's preaching:
co^serning the means of salvation dependith only of the mouth of Christ and
disputithe no more the matter, then Christ shewithe him the way and makithe a
ladder for Nicodemus where with he may ascend into heaven and says this ways
thou may understond the thing I spek of. Sicut Moses exaltauit serpentem in
deserto, ita exaltari oportet filium hominis: as Moses lifft upp the serpent in
the desert, so must the son of man belyfft uppe. This history of the serpent
was not unknowyn unto this lernid man: albe it he consyderid not the mystery
and sacrament that it figurid. Now Christ teachithe him in this place to
understo^d the law and because this oration of Christ wroten by sanct Johan is
obscure and lackith a declaracion somewhat of the purpose that Christ would
prove: omittit Ebreorum more alteram similitudinis partem. I will annex the
type and figure with theffect and mystery of the figure and make the text
plain, Sicut Moses exaltauit serpentem in deserto, sic exaltari oportet filiu^
hominis. Moses was commaundid to lifft upp this serpent in the wilderness for
this cause, that who so ever was stong or uenemyd with the poison of the
serpents if he lokyd upon the serpent of brass might be helyd. Here is the
cause and theffect declared. Why the serpent was lifft upp. Now to the words
of Christ. Ita exaltari oportet filium hominis, ut omnis qui credit in illum
no^ pereat, sed habeat uitam aeternam, So must Christ belyfft upp that as many
as beliue in him shall have ever lasting lieffe. Here is Nicodemus tawght the
way unto ever lasti^g lief and because he was adoctor of Moses law Christ by
the law made open the matter unto him and browght him from the shadow unto the
true body and from the letter, unto the understonding of the letter sayng as
those that by faith beheld the serpent were helyd of the stynges of the
serpent, so souche as behold me in faith hanging upon the cross shall be helid
from there sykenis and sin that the devil by the serpent infectyd man kind
with all. Now let us repet the text of Moses again, that we may trewly
undrestond our saviors words. Fac tibi Serpentem urentem, and pone eum in
palum in subli me sublatum, fietque si serpens aliquem momorderit, intueatur
eum, and incolumis erit. In these words is declared three things.

First, why the serpent was set upp. The cause: the people were stong with
serpents.

Second: theffectt: the health of the people.

Third: the use: that they should look upon him. so Johan declarythe whi Christ
was made man, thuse, and theffect of his humanite in these words: Sic Deus
dilexst mundum, ut filium suum unigenitum daret, ut omnis qui credit in eum non
pereat, sed habeat uitam aeternam. The cause of his cummyng was the sin and
sikens of man betyn by the serpent in paradyse: theffect of his cumming was the
healhe of this sikenis: the use of his cumming was to belyue that his death
upon the cross was and is sufficient for the remission of sin and to obtain
eternal lief. Here is the justification of man lively expressyd. and how many
things concur as necessary unto the remission of sin and yet man only
justified by faith. The word of God, the preacher of the word, Christ
himself, the co^tricion of Nicodemus, the holy ghost that mouyd Nicodemusto
cum by night unto Christ, the consentyng will of Nicodemus untho the words of
Christ. Yet only was hedelyueryd from sin by the faith that he had in the
death of Christ, as Christ says: sic oportet exaltari filium hominis, ut
omnis qui credit in illum non pereat, sed habeat uitam aeternam. This must be
diligently markyd. For as the fathers of the old church usid the serpent, so
must those of our church use the precious body of Christ, they lokyd upon him
only with the yees of faith they kyssyd him not, they cast no water upon him
and so wayshyd there yeys therewith all, they touchyd him not with there hands,
they eat him not nor corporally, nor really, nor substancially, yet by there
belyue they optaynid health, so Christ him self teachit us the use of his
precious body, to belyue and look upon the merits of his passion suffryd upon
the cross and so to use his precious body against the stynge of original and
actual sin. Not to eat his body, transformid into the form of bred, or in
the bred with the bread: under the bread. behind the bred or be fore the bread,
corporally, or bodily substancially, or realli, invisible, or any souch ways
as mani men to the great iniurijs of Christ's body does teach, but as the
children of Israel only by faith eat the body spiritually not yet born, so by
faith does the Christianes eat him now being ascendyd into heaven and none
other wice as Christ says unto Nicodemus: omnis qui credit in eum, non pereat
grant that we could as well eat his carnal body, as we eat other meat yet the
eating thereof nothing auaylyd. And if the Apostelles had corporally eatin him
in his last supper it had profetyd nothing. For he took not his body of the
holy uirgine to that use to be eatin for the remission sin Or to sanctify
him that eat him, but to dye for sin and that ways to sanctify his church
as he says himself: that only by death the fruit of his incarnacion should be
dispersyd into the worold. Nisi granu^ frumenti deiectum in terram mortuum
fuerit, ipsum solum manet: mortua prodest caro, no^ comesa. But of this Iwill
speak farther in the chapter that folowithe. This example of Nicodemus
declarithe, that neth^r the works that go before iustificacion, nether those
that follow justification deserve remission of sin. Though sole faith
exclude not other uertews to be present at the conversion of every sinner, yet
does sole faith and only exclude the merits of other uertews and optaynith
soly remission of sin for Christ's sake herself alone as paul says Ephesians.
2. Gratia saluati estis per fidem, idque non ex uobis, Dei donum est, non ex
operi bus ne quis glorietur. Where as plainly he excludith the dignite of
works, and affirmith us to be reconcilid by faith, so does Johan. cap. 1.
attribut those too singular yefftes unto Christ, grace and uerite sayng: lex
per Mosen data est, gratia and ueritas per Iesum Christum facta est. Here grace
signifies fre remission of sin for the merits of Christ. Verite is the true
knolege of god and the gyfftes off the holy ghost that folowithe the remission
of sin. Therefore souche as say, they be not justified only by faith in the
mercy of god throwgh Christ, extenuat sin and gods Ire against syn^e to
mouche, and likwyce spoil Christ of his honor Who is the only sacrifice that
takith away the sin of the worold. They that will justify them selfs any
other ways then by faith, doothe dout all ways whether there sinnis be for
yeuen or not and by reason of this dout they can never pray unto god aright for
he that doutith whether god be his fre^d or not, prays not: but as an Ethnyke
says his pater noster with out faith and godly mocion of the heart. He that is
persuadid by the gospel, thowgh his own unworthynis fere him from God yet
beholdith he the son^e of god and belyuithe that both he hand his prayers be
acceptid in Christ and thus acceptyd into grace will follow the live of a
justified man, as Paul co^mau^dith To. 8. Coloss. 3. and as all the scripture
yeuith example, for it is no profet to say, sole faith justifies, except
godlinis of lief follow as Paul says si secundum earnem uixeritis moriemini,
he that has opteinyd the remission of sin must diligently pray for the
preseruacion of Gods favor as David yeuith example unto the hole church
saing: Cor mundum crea in medeus, and spiritum rectum innoua in uiceribus meis.
Ne proijcias me a facie tua, and Spiritum sanctum tuum ne auferas a me Read
mihi leticiam salutaris tui. and spiritu principali suffulci me, Psalm. 50.
This prayer conteynith a wounderfull doctrine and necessari to be dayli repetyd
with great attenci on and head first he defyryth to have a heart pure and net,
iudgyng a right of God, to fere his justice against sin and to beliue
steadfastly his promisyd merci unto the penite^ces and that this light and
knolege be not taken from him by the devil or uanite of the worold, as daily
we se souch as hatb, the knolege of Gods word, to live more worldly the^ he
that knoith not what god is, then prayth to have the help of god to govern all
his counsels and all the motions of his heart that they may be agreeable unto
the law of god, full of faith, fere and cherite, that for sin he be no more
cast out from the face and favor of god, prayth to have strength in aduersite,
and to reyoyce under the cross of affliction, not to murmur nor grug at any
troble but to obey willingly the pleasure of god, not to leave him, nor
mistrust his mercy for any punishment, but to suffer what god pleacyth, as
mouch as god pleasith, and when god pleacyth: these uertewes must man practyse
an use affter he is justified, as well as to optaine remission of his sin, or
else he is not justified at all, he is but a speaker of iustificacion, and
has no justice within him. As he makith Christ only his savior, so must he
follow souch as were of Christis family the patriarchs, prophets and the
Apostelles in the lyffe prescribid by Christ as they did, or else they shall be
no disciples of the prophets that were the doers as well as the speakers of
uertewe. But rather the disciples of the poets that only commendyd uertew and
folowid it not as ovid says, Est deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo:
Sedibus aetherijs, spiritus ille uenit. These holy words auaylyd nothing.
Souch as cannot understond the Epistole of Paul to the Romans conserning
justification and what lief is requirid of him that is justified, let him red
diligently the first Epistole of Johan, and then he shall right well perceive
an other lyffe to be requirid of the justified man, then the gospellers led now
aday that has words, with out factes Which slaunderith the gospel and
promotith it not, as it is to be sen (the more pety) in souche me^ and souche
cornteis as the truith has been prechid along time. For the receuing of it
unwortyly the lord will doutles take from them his word, and leave them unto
there own lusts. For this is certain and to true, let the hole gospel be
preachid unto the worold, as it awght to be penence and a uertuse lieff with
faith, as God preachyd the gospel unto Adam in Paradyse, Noe, Abraham, Moses,
Esaias: saing: uegenti pecatrici, Johan the Baptist: poenitencam agite,
appropinquat regnu^ coelorum. As Christ did: Recipiscite and ctedlte Euangelio,
Mar. 1. and then of an hundred that co^mith to the gospel there would not com
one: when they here sole faith and the mercy of god to iustisie and that they
may eat all meats at all times with thanks yeuing, they imbrase that gospel
with all Joy and willing heart. And what is he that would not receive this
gospel, thefles he itself were there no im^ortal soul in it, would receue
this gospel, because it promisithe aid healpe and consolacion with out works,
and when it hyrythe that it may as well eat a pastie of uenisiin upon the
frydaye as a heryn, what is he that would not be souche agospeller? But now
spek of the other part of the gospel as Paul teachith to the Romans 8. cap.
Si secundum carnem uixeritis moricmini. and as he prescribith the lieff of a
justified man, in the same Epist. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. capite. Christ Matt. 10.
Peter, 2. Petri 1. he that is justified let him study those canones to live by.

Saint Paul, writithe to a justified church of the Corinthions and to souche
as had receauid the knolege of the gospel, and says: Si quis cum frater
appelletur, fuerit scortator, aut auarus aut simulachrorum cultor, aut
conuiciator, aut ebriosus, aut rapax, cu^ eiusmodi ne cibum capiatis, 1. Cor.
5. This part of the gospel, is not so pleasant as the other: therefore men
take the first liberty, and neglect the fruits that should follow the gospel,
and think the^ selfs to be rich in the gospel as the church of the
Laodicenses iudgid of them selfs, Apocalip. 3. when they be indede miserable
and wreachid: pour and nakyd of all godlynys. Paul declarithe Romans 8. what It
is to be justified and to be in Christ to walk affter the sprit he seythe:
Nulla condemnatio est lex his, qui sunt in Christo Jesus qui secundum spiritum
ambula^t. For a conclusion, justification is a fre remission of sin and
acceptance into tbe favor of God for Christ's merits the which remission of
sin must follow necessaryly amendment of lyffe, or else we receive the grace
of God inuayne, 2. Cor. 6. To. 8. 2. Petri 1.

Caput VIII.
OF this infallible uerite only the death of Christ to be the sacrifice for
the expiacion of sin may be necessarily tawght the right and true use of the
Lords supper which men call the Mass. First it is manifest that it is not a
sacrifice for sin as men teach contrary unto the word of god that says
Christ by one sacrifice made perfet all things Ebre. 7. 8. 9. 10. and as
Johan. says, Sanguis Jesus Christi emundat nos a peccatis and there remaynithe
no more after it as Paul says, Vbi peccatorum remissio ibi no^ amplius hostia
pro peccato and to take away all dout that remission of sin cannot be
optaynid for the me rites of the mass Paul says plainly that without
bludshedding no sacrifice can merit remission of sin. Althowge Christ now
sit at the ringht hand of god and pray for his church and like wice does
offer the prayers and complaynt of us that belyue: yet it is only for the
merits of his death that we obtain the mercy of gods promise, in the
which he susteynid souche pain that the remembrance thereof, and the greatnis
of gods Ire against sin, put his precious body and solle in souch an agony
and fere, that his passion of sorrow surmountyd, the passions, of all men that
ever trauelyd: or were bordenyd with the weight and peace of gods importable
Ire against man for syn^, in so mouche that he wept not only tyres of blud, but
so abundantly, pain forsid them to descend that they trycklid upon the
grown. Sore troblyd and over co^ with sorrow was David Psa. 6 When he wayshyd
his bed with tyres for sin, but it was Joy and myrthe if his pains be
conferrid to these dolores of Christ. They wantyd no augmentation, this
sacrifice was kyllyd alitle, and alitle, from one place of judgment send unto
the other, and all ways from the flames, into the arde^t coals, his death
upon the cross so differryd, that altowgh he was uery god and the dear belouid
son of the ffather his abiection was so contemptible and uile* that he cried
out as Aman most destitute of gods favor and love: and said: Deus meus, Deus
meus, quare dereliquisti me? And until souch time as he offryd his most holy
soul unto the father and his blessid side percid with the spear, his pains
and sorrows incressyd. Lo thus was the manner to offer Christ for sin affter
this sort and cruel handelyng of Christ was their of God apecid, If they
sacrifice Christ in the mass, let the^ hang him tyrauntes again upon the
cross and thrust a spear to his blessid heart, that he may shed his blud for
with out schedding of blud is no remission: the scripture damnythe this abuse
of the lords supper, and is the co^culcation of his precious blud. As
concerning the use of this Sacrament and all other The rites and ceremonijs
that be godly they should be so kept, and usyd in the church, as they were
deliueryd unto us of the high Bishope Christ, the auctor of all Sacraments.
For this is true that he most godly: most religiousi: and most perfetly:
institutyd and celebratyd the supper. And None other ways then the Evangelist
doothe record. the best manner and most godly way to celebrat this supper is to
preach the death of Christ unto the church. And the redemption of man: as
Christ did at his supper, and there to have commune prayers as Christ prayed
with his disciples, then to repet the last words of the supper and with the
same to break the bread and distribute the win to the hole church. Then
yeuyng thanks to God: depart in peace: these ceremonijs that God institutyd
not But repugneth Gods institution be not necessari but rether in any case to
be leffte because they abrogat the institution of Christ. it semithe sufficient
unto me if the church do as Christ has commaundid it to do.

years wrote his Epistole and said he would deliver them nothing but that he had
receauid of the lord and wrote conserning the use of the supper as Matthew. Mark.
and Luk writithe this is therefore and ungodly disputacion that the Papists
contend abut the change and alteracion of the bread, and also a false and
pernicious doctrine, that teachyth the corporal presence of Christ, booth God
and man in the bread for althowgh Christ said of the bread this mi body. It is
well knowyn that he purposid to institute a sacrament. Therefore he spak of a
sacrament sacramentally. To spek sacramentally is to gyne the Name of the thing
to the sign, so, yet not withsto^ding that the nature and substaince of the
sign remaynit and is not turnid into the thing that it signifiet, farther the
uerite of the scripture and the uerite of a Christian faith will not suffer to
judge and belyue Christ's body invisible or uisible to be upon the Earth Act. 1.
Luce ult. Mar. ult. Act. 3. If we lik wyce consider the other places of the
scripture Joan. 6. 16. 17. we shall find that Christ would not nor meant not, to
institute any corporal presence of his body: But a memory of the body slain
resuscitatyd, ascendid into heuens and from thense to cu^ unto judgment, true
it is that the body is eatin and the blud dronkyn but not corporally in faith
and sprit it is eatyn, and by that sacrament the promis of god sealyd and
co^firmid in us. The corporal body remaining in heuyn, in the 24 chapter of
Matthew, Christ yeuing his church warning of this heresy to cum by the
preaching of false Prophets said, they will say, lo here is Christ, lo there
is Christ, belyue them not, for as the lightynyng co^mith from the est into the
west so shall the cumming of the sone of man be, meanyg by these words that
his body is not a fantastical bodi, nor inuifible as these teach that say his
corporal body is corporally yeuen in the bread with the bred and under the
bred invisible, Against this error I will set the word of God and declare the
truith therbi, that they have but an ymagynacio^ or ydeam of Christ's body, and
not the natural, and corporal body. and the first reason is this. Christ bid
his disceples they should not belyue him that should say. Lo here is Christ or
there is Christ. he spoke of his body doutles and human nature for he
commaundith us to belyue that his godhed is eueri where as David says. and as
he says, my father and Iamone likwyce, he told the^ be plain words Math. the
last capi. that he would be with them unto the end of the worold. Christ having
but too natures one divine and the other humane by these express words now he
declarithe to be present with the one, and absent with the other. these things
markyd I put this matter incomprysse to be iudgid of every humble and cheritable
sprytyd man, who iudgithe aright of the body of Christ those that say bodily he
is not in the sacrament, or these that say he is bodily and corporalli there.
If he be there corporally and bodily as they say. Why shall Inot beliue these
words: Ecce hic: ecce illic, and say Christ lyyth that said beliue them not
that say lo here is my body or there is my bodi Christ having God experience of
the deuillis subtilty, that he would intoxcitat the wit of man with more
subtle reasones then the simple heart could eschew preparyd of his mercy amenys
to preserve the faith of the simple and against the sophistical and craufty
reason of the deuitl God callith man to the judgment of his senses, and says
reason what they will of my body and say it is here or there, substancially
bodily corporally: belyue them not, trust to thyn lie for as the lightning
sensible commith from the est into the west, so shall the co^mig of the son
of man be. howso? Turnyd into fire. no: so uisible and sensible, God wist right
well when he called man from reason to the judgment of his senses. what Doctors
and doctrine should follow of his sensible body one to change acak into his body,
and an other to teach though the cak be not his body, yet is his body present
corporally substantially, really, bodily, the same body that hankyd upon the
crose and is yeuen by hand, with the bred. Under the bred and in the hred, and
yet insensensible. Grant all there gloses and interpretations to be true as
they be most false, and say as they would have it, that the uery true
humanite, and Christ in the true shape and form of aman as he is with all
qualites and quantities except sin and immortalite to be in the bred, under
the bred, or with the brod, after the bred or before the bred and say there is
present in the pristes hand as great abody and as natural aman as the pryst or
minister is himself: the word of god made man: so they would have it: they
shall never deceive agodly Christian with there gloses, for he will trust unto
the simplicite of gods word that says Nolite credere, belyue them not till
they show my body unto the senses, for as the lighe thing. The defenders of
this doctrine because they be not able to auswer unto souch as wrytith and
preachith the truith: they chalinge and attrribut unto them selfs thonly
knolege of truith, and sai there contrarijs be not lernid nor ca^nor undresto^d
them grant there wore none lernyd that defendith this truith as therebe has
and ever till the woroldes end shall be, yet will the truithe defend it self,
and because noman should in this matter leave she truithe, thowghe better lernyd
then he judge phantastically of a true body: Christ would his simple disciple to
judge sensible of his natural body and let this sophtsticatio^ pass and says
his body shall be assensible is the ligthing in the air, and not invisible with
apeac of bread thowge that most religious sacrament awght to be most godly
usyd for the mystery that it conteynith, and likwice the promise of grace that
it confirmith. they say this place makith not against the presence of Christ's
body in the sacrament, But against souch as should preach in the Later days
false doctrine against Christ's doctrine: and make an other Christ: true it is
he spekith of souch as should preach false doctrine: but what should be that
false doctrine, that could be over co^ with these words: Nolite credere sicut
fulgetum coruscans uenit ab Orient in Occidente, ita erit adue^tus filius
hominis, what heresi redith any man in the historijs to be uanquishid by these
words, not of Samosatenus that was condemnid in the concell of Nece. Not of
Nestor that denied too natures to be unit in Christ Nor of Eutiches that said
one nature was conuertyd into the other. None of the heresis that the devil
mouid against the essence and divine Maiesti of god as Marcion and the
Manicheis that said there were too gods and booth eternal, the one god and
the other isle all ways the one repugnat to the other. Nether yet the heresy of
Valentiniane that said there were nnumerable gods but this false doctrine
Christ spoke: by souch as would aster his ascension into heaven corporally yet
preach in the later days unto the people that his body should be in the earth.
And therefore gave the^ these words belyue them not, for as the lightning
commithe from the est to the west so shall the cumming of the son of man be,
Christ spoke of those that should deceive the people in the time betwyne his
asce^sion and coming to judgment, for in the end of the worold it shall be no
need to bid us beware for all false preachers shall be damnyd when his glorious
body shall opere. He that belyuith before that the natural body of Christ ca^
be here oni way corporally, neglecth the commandment of Christ, Nolite
credere, Matt. 24. and likwyce for gotith his creed, Sedet ad dextram patris,
inde uenturus est etc. and Luk says plainly that as uisible as he asce^did, so
shall he desce^d at the latter day and not before as he says. Acto. 3. be
cause they defend there opinion by the wrong interpreation of the words in the
Articles of our faith I will answer to one or to objections that they make
first they say that this word heaven in the article of our foyth, ascendit ad
coelos, signifies no certain and determinat place but generalli all the
worold heaven, ert, and hell where so ever gods pour be manifestyd. and so
says that the right hand of God be tokith no place. but the hole pore of God.
as when I say: Sedet ad dextram Dei. It is asmouche to say as he is in his
humanite every where as his diuite is. Unto the first this i answer. that
heaven in no place of the scripture is so taken towghe it signify some time all
the celestal bodies above, heuens eternal, and the it signifies the air: as.
Psalm. 149. a quae quae supra coelos sunt laudent nomen domini. And sometime it
signifies only the suppre place of creatures as in the same Psalm: Laudate
eum coeli supremi. Into these superior heuens Christ ascendid as the manner of
his ascension declaryth, Luc. ultimo. Acto. 1. He tok his disciples with hi^
into the mount of olyuet, and bid them there farewell he departid bodily from
the^ as there yeys bore them record, and a clude receauyd this body that it
could no more be sen yet what became of this body affter that it passyd there
sight that no question afterward should be where this body was become, Luc says.
Ferebatur in coelum, capit. ultimo. This mutation of place to asce^d from the
earth only his humane nature suffryth, concerning his God head it is every
where, and can nether ascend nor descend souche as say that heaven and the right
hand of God is in the articles of our faith taken for gods pore and might
which is every where, they do wrong to the seripture and unto the articles of
our faith they make a confusion of the scripture and leave nothing certain the
darkyn the simple and plain uerite thereof with intolerable sophismes the make
heaven: hell: and hell heaven torn upp side down and pervert the order of God:
if the heaven and gods right hand whether our saniours body is ascendyd be
every where and notith no certain place as these uncertayne men teach, I will
belyuc no ascension what nedith it seeing Christ's body is every where with his
goded. I will interpretat this article of my creed thus: Christus ascendit ad
dextram patris, patris dextra est ubique, ergo Christus ascendit ad ubique. Se
what erronyus doctrine folowith there imaginacions. As co^serning the right
hand of God it is taken sometime for God himself and his omnipotent pour.
Psalm. 117. dextra domini fecit uirtutem, dextra domini exaltauit me. thus his
right hand taken for his poor it is every where. But it is not so taken, when
when say Christ sittithe at the right hand of God. As mark says. capit. ultimo
and as Stephen said, Act. 7. Video Iesum stantem a dextris Dei. But it
signifies acertayne place of Joy where as the sowles of the blessed sanctes
rest. thither has God translatyd the body of Christ to be in as mouche Joy,
as it was incontempt here in the earth as Paul says Philip. 2. Sitting thus
at the right hand of god. his body, is as true man as it was upon the earth and
in lenghe breath and weight as physical, matematical, and natural abody as it
was hanging upon the cross, in the changing of mortale qualites the humanite
of Christ is nether destroyed, nor changid into his deite. but as trewly as his
godhed concerning his essence cannot be sen. so is his body where so ever it be:
subject unto the judgment of the senses. And as he that makith a house first
conceuithe a true form in his imaginacion and yet the imaginacion nor concept
of the mind is not materiali the house so souche as dream and imagine a
certain fantasy and reduce the form and figure of a true body into there
imagination is not a true body, but a co^cept or imaginacion of a body, as
those men have, that say Christ is in the bread and with the bread yet ocopy
yth it no place, nor is not sensible. This is a wounderful doctrine, to make
that glorious body of Christ to be a true body, and yet lackith all the
qualites and quantites of a body, if Christ could have souche a dreming body,
as they spek of yet may I not belyue, it is in the sacrament corporally because
Christ says Nolite credere. And where they would better the matter with these
words that Christ in the time of his being upon therthe did many things above
the nature of abody and caryd his body sometime invisible, and entryd the house
of the disciples the gates being shut, they prove nothing, only the troble the
simple conscience, and stablysh souch as be more addict unto the writing of man
then unto the writing of god in there error. Peter walkid upon the water, yet
was uery man nothing the less so it pleacyd god to use his creatures to his
glory. Christ's body was nothing changyd all though somtymes for fere of the
stones, he conveyed himself out of the way, thowghe his disciples knew not how
he entryd the doors being shit, it is possible Inowg that he opened the doors
and yet they perceauid it not: men's yeyes be obedient unto the creator that
they may se on think and yet not a another. The scripture so teachite. those isle
men that would have don uilanye unto the angels in loothes house Gene. 19.
were made so blind they could not find the next door to them, yet bid lothes
house still in one place, the same may ye read 4. Reg. 6. how god made blind
the assirians host so that Elizeus led the hole army into the cite of Samarie.
Balaam saw to bet his Ass, And yet could not see the angel that the Ass saw
till he was reprehendid by the Angel Number. 22. here may ye se that those
reasones prouith nothing, that they would Christ's bodi to be in the sacrament
because so^times he would not be sen of his ennymys. This is our belyue that
Christ is ueri man and lik unto his brothers, Ebr. 2. therefore where so ever
his body be it must have the qualites and quantites of a true man, if his body
be corporally in the sacrament and yet with out all propertis of a true body,
this text is false habitu iuuentus ut homo likwyce this similis est fratri bus
per omnia? They grant that only the sprit of man eatithe the bodi of Christ in
the sacrament: then other the sprit of man is turnyd into a corporal
substance, or else the body of Christ lostithe his corporal substance and is
become a sprit: for it is not possibile for the sprit of man to eat corporally a
corporal body: no more then he that studith the scripture and comme^dith the
contents of the Bible to his memory, eatith corporalli the book: but by the
help of gods sprit and his own diligence he eatith theffect, Marie and
doctrine of the Bible and incase it were corporally and substancially with
paper and ynk in the botom of the sea yet the lernid man may comfort him self
and teach the maryners in the ship with the co^tentes thereof thowghe the
corporal Bible be drowid. So in the sacrament the Christian heart that is
instructid in the law of god and knowith the right use of the sacraments, by
the holy ghost and afyrm faith that he has in the merits of Christ's body and
soul which is ascendid corporally into heaven, man in sprit receive theffect,
Marrye, swetnys, and commodite of Christ's precious body thowg it never descend
corporally, thus does faith and the scripture compel the church to be live.
When they say it is in the sacrament and yeth mouith not from the right hand of
God I belyue not there sayng: but require aprobation thereof Christ has not so
great a body to fill heaven and earth corporally similis est fratribus perfectus
deus and perfectus homo, they make him there and yet ocopy no place, then it is
no body for a true body physical and matematical: as Christ's body is: cannot
be except it ocopi place they say I must belyue and say with the uirgine,
Ecceancilla domini. I may not seek to know the means how, Well let them do
asmouch to me in this matter as was don unto the uirgine Mari and I am content,
she could not comprehend how Christ was made man in here belly, yet theffect and
corporal natyuite of Christ assertaynyd booth here reason and senses that she
had born a true bodi. It shall suffice me if they make demonstracio^ unto my
senses and warrant my reason that they have present a corporal body: how it
cummith and by what means I leave that unto god but until souch time as they
show me that glorious and perfeit man's body of Christ as it was shewid unto
the blessid uirgine there sayng: belyue: belyue: shall not com into my belyue
for Christ says, Nolite credere. Of Christ's words Marci 13. de die illo
nemoscit, the moment of the last time No man knowithe, nether the son of god
in asmouche as he is man I gather this argument. A maiori, if it be denied
Christ concerning his man head to know the last day: mouch more to be every
where, or to be in diuer places at one time is denied his humanite, for it is
more i^possible and wounderfull to be every where then to know many things. I
kno the Geographus conceuithe and co^prehendithe all the worold in his head. But
to be in all places where as his thowghtes and sprit is ocopyed it is
impossible farther Christ is body has not loost his corporal qualites, but
where so ever he be corporaly, there is he with all qualites of abody, and not
with out qualites, as these dreamers imagine. I will not judge my savior that
died for the sin of the worold to have abody in heaven sensible with all
qualites of true man and in the sacrament with out all qualites and quantites
of a true body But abhor and detest with the scriptura this opinion as an
heresy, so little differing from marcion that I can scarce put diversity: as
corporally is the corporal and substantial body of all England in the head of
him that describith by mape or cart, the hole Realm in Italy or other where: so
corporally is the body of Christ in the heart of the Christian. The concept
imaginacion or form conceuid of England is not the body matter nor substance
self of inglond, no more is the spiritual co^cept of Christ's body, the
corporal body it self thowg Auicen and Auerrois would prow souch a conclusion
yet the faith of our Religion will not suffer it: a Pantasticall imagination to
be a true substannce to say that Christ's uere natural body is in the earth and
yet invisible it is to destroy the body and not to honor the body. Aristole li.
5. metaphisicoru^ cap. 22. definit what invisible is: invisible (inquit) est
quod non habet omni no colorem. Take this from Christ's body that it is trewly
in the sacrament corporally and yet invisible, is to say Christ has lost all
the color shape and form of his humanite. But what shall Aristolle do in this
our faith, the scripture teachith what we should belyue ascendit ad coelos,
sedet ad dex tram Dei patris omnipotentis. Inde ue^turus est iudicare uiuos and
mortuos, Act. 1. Mar, ultimo, Luc. ultimo. And has leffte us a sacrament of
his blessid body the which wear bond to use religiousy and many times to
exercise and stablish our faith, and he being absent corporally does
communicate by faith in sprit that most precious body and the merits of the
same, and would to god people would use it with more reverence and more awght as
the scriptur teachith, with true amendemet of lieff and fyrm faith. I pout out
a book in Septembre last past dedycatyd to my lord of wincheffter where in I
have declarid all my faith conserning this blessed and holy sacrament, therefore
I will pass to the other office of Christ's pryshed.

Caput IX.
THe fourth office of Christ is to consecrat and sanctify these that beliue
in him. He is not only holy him self but makith holy others also. As he says
Ioa^. 17. Pro eis sanctifico meipsum, ut sint and ipsi sanctificati
perueritatem. this sanctification is none other but a true knolege of God in
Christ by the gospel that teachyth us how unclene wear by the sin of Adamme,
an how that wear clensid by Christ for who is sake the father of heaven doothe
not only remitt the sins wrowght willyngly against the word of God. but also
the imperfectio^n and natural concupiscens which remaynythe in every man as
long as the nature of man is mortal. How the father does sanctify his people
the prayer of Christ shewith Joan. 17. sanctifica eos per ueritatem tuam.
sanctify them by thy word purche the heart, teach them, halow them make them
apt for thy kyngdon. wherwithe? with thy word which is ever lasti^g uerite.
The mea^s to sanctify is the word of God, the holy ghost and faith that
receuith the word of our redemption so doothe Peter say, Acto. 15. Fide purgari
corda nostra. Here is the cause expressyd whereby we accept our sanctificacion
by faith says sanct Peter saynct Paul. 1. Corint. 6. shewith for whois sake
and wherefore we are sanctified. Abluti estis, sanctificati estis, iustificati
estis per nomen domini Jesus per spiritum Dei nostri. For the merits of Jesus
Christ by the operacion of the holy ghost. This is to be allwaies markyd, that
when Christ had prayed his father to sanctify his church by his word, and by
his holy sprit and destityd him: to preserve them from i will for his mercys sake
He addid the price the merits and just deseruyng of Gods graces and said I
sanctify my self for them because they may be sanctified by the truith. He
sanctified himself for the church when he died for the detestable unclenys
and fylthinis thereof more stynkyng and fylthy the^euer was the thaborryd and
leporous bodi of Lazar 9. as tawghe he had said for asmouch as I offer and
submitt myself unto the bitter and cruel pain of the cross for the church
thou must most holy father sanctify them, and accept them as sanctified,
norysh the^ love them, and defend them for the price and satisfaction of my
death. what a consolacion is this for every troblyd conscience to undrestond
althowgh it be unworthi of remission of sin for the gratnys thereof: yet for
the prayer of Christ he shall not be a cast away so that he belyue. as Christ
said, he praid not only for his Apostelles but also for as many as should beliue
his word till the woroldes end, as many as will be gospellers as the Jove the
gospel and there own salvation let them not daily and play with it as thowgh
god were a babe to be pleacid with a figg for syn let him thynk upon the most
uile and tyrannous death of him that only was able to cleanse us from sin^e and
from hens beware of sin it suffycit as Paul says that before we knew the
truith to live want only. 1. Cor. 6.

Caput X. Of this verite and truit that the gospel reachith us only to be
sanctfiied in the blud of Christ is confutyd the blaspemus pride of the Bishope
of Rome.
THat namith himself the most holy father and takith upon him to sanctify all
other men of therth as Gods uicar and leave tenent. to absolve a poena and a
culpa, to pull out of hell and send to heaven with his pardons Masses and other
abominations where as Christ only and soly does sanctifice as it apperyd
Joan. 17. lik wice by the title that Pilate gave him hanging upon the cross.
With these words Jesus Nazarenus rex Iudaeoru^. This title declarith him to
be both Moshia he savior and Noser the protector and sanctifier of his church
as Math. says ca. 2. Nazareus uocabitur. This office of Christ does abrogate
all other things that man's co^stitutions attribute any holynis unto as be
wychyd water Candellis bows or any souch Ethnic supersticion. For only Christ
sanctifies and all holynis we must attribut unto him. As Johan said, Ecce
agnus dei, qui tollit peccata mundi Johan. 1. behold the lamme of god. To say
destenyd and appoyntid by god to take away the sin of the world and to
sanctify his church althowgh baptism be a sacrament to be receauid and
honorable usyd of all me^ yet it sanctifiet noman, and souch as attribut the
remission of sin unto the external sign does offend. Johan Matthew. 3.
preachid penitence in the desert and remission of sin in Christ, souch as
confessid there fawtes he markyd and declared the^ to be of Christ's church so
that external baptism was but an in auguracion or external co^secracio^ of
these that first belyuyd and were clensid of there sin as he declarith him
self in the same place: Ego (inquit) baptizo aqua. I Chrtstine with water as
towgh he said: My baptism makith Noma^ the Better, inwardly it changith noman.
But I call and preach to the utward ere. I exhort unto penence. And souch as
say they do repent and would change the old sinful lieff. I way shwith water,
he that inwardly clensith is stronger then I. his grace it is only that
purifieth the soul: I baptize in penence to say into a new lieff. This new
lieff co^mith not until souch time as Christ be known and receauyd. now to
put on Christ, is to live a new lieff. souch as be baptisyd must remember, that
penenc and faith presedyd this external sign and in Christ the purgacion was
inwardely optaynyd before the external sign was yeuen. So that there is too
kinds of baptism and booth necessari: the one interior which is the
clensing of the heart, the drawyng of the father the operacion of the holy ghost
and this baptism is in manwhe^ he belyuith and trustith that Christ is the
only auctor of his salvation. thus be the infantes examinyd conserning
repentanc and faith before they be baptisyd with water at the contemplacion of
the which faith God purchith tha soul. then is the extereor sign addyd not to
purch the heart but to confirm manifest and open unto the worold that this child
is gods and likwyce baptism with the Repition of the words is a uery
sacrament and sign that the baptisyd creature should die from sin all his
lyffe, as Paul wrytithe Roma. 6. likewyce noman should condemn nor neglect
this exterior sign for the commandments sake: thowghe it have no pore to
purche from sin yeat it confirmith the purgation of sin and the Act of it
self pleasith god, for because the receauers thereof obey the will of his
commandment. Like as the Kings majesty that now is: immediately aster the
death of his father was the true and legittyme King of Inglond, right heir
unto the crown and receauid his coronacion not to make him self there by King,
but to manifest that the Kingdom apperteynid unto him before, he takith the
crown to confirm his right and title, had all inglond said nay and by forse
contrary unto gods laws and manns laws with an exterior ceremony and pomp
crownid any other man he should have been an adulterous and wrong King, with all
his solemnites and coronation. Thowgh this ceremony co^firm and manifest a King
in his Kingdom yet it makith not a King^ But the laws of God and of the land
that yeuith by succession the right of the Kingdom to the old Kings first here
male in England an other Realms And the babe in the cradell has as godd right
and cleame and is as true a King in his cradell uncrownid as his father was
thowgh he reygnid a crownid King xl. yers, and this right of the babe should be
defendid and manifestid not only by the ceremony of coronation, but with all
obedience and true subjection. So is it in the church of Christ, man is made
the brother of Christ and heir of eternal lief by gods only mercy receuid
by faith before he receive any ceremony to confirm and manifest openly his
right and title he says he belyuith in the father the son and the holy ghost
and beliuith he says the remission of sin. Does not only deny the devil
the worold and sin but says he will for sake him for ever and serve his
master the lord of uertewe King of heaven and Earth. thus assurid of god and
clensid from sin in Christ. He has the lyuerye of god yeuen unto him,
baptism the which no Christian should neglect, and yet not attribut his
sanctification unto the external sign, as the Kings majesty may not
attribut his right unto the crown but unto god and unto his father who has
not only yeuen him grace to be born into the world. but also to govern as a
king in the worold, who is right and Title the crown co^firmyth and shewithe
the same unto all the worold. Where as this right by God and natural
succession presedith not: the coronacion, the ceremony auaylith nothing a
treatur may receive the crown and yet true king nothing the rather, so an
Hypocrite and infidel may reeeue the external sign of baptism and yet, no
christian man nothing the rather as Simon Magus and other. Sacraments must be
usid holyly, and yet not to have the office of Christ addid unto the^. soly it
is his office to sanctify and purch from sin. Itak nothing from the
sacraments but honor them and extolle them in all things as they be worthy
How be it not to mouch. I call a sacrament, a ceremony institutyd in the law of
God, to this end that it should be a testimonye of Gods promise un to all
souch as belyue and signs of gods godwill and favor toward us: as Paul
says that Abraham receauid a testimonye, by the which God testified that he
was receauyd into grace, Romans 4. And as the promys of God the remission of
sin is receauyd by faith, so must these Sacraments that be signs tokens and
testimonijs of the promise: be receauid in faith. thus by Christ wear
sanctified only. And as Peter says, the people chosen, a pryncly prished a
holy people and peculier nation to declare the pore of him that has callid us
frow the darkenis of error and sin into his wounder full light. these words
declare the manner how wear sanctified, and what our office is affter we be
sanctified: to preach the pore of him that has callid us from the darknys of
sin as it is wroten Esa. 43. Populum istum for maui mihi ut laude^ meam
annunciet. and likwyce ca. 66. the Prophets and Apostelles does use many
times this word: annunciare, pro laudare and gratias agere so does Paul 1.
Cor. 11. Mortem domini annunciabitis donec ueniat ye shall show the death of
the lord until he com, id est, ye shall celebrat the death of Christ with all
preses and yeuing of thanks: souche as be sanctified by Christ must live an
honest and holy lief or else his sanctification auaylith not, as god for soke
the chylder of Israel for sin so will he do us, they were electyd to be his

Therefore one of these too we must needs do that say we be justified and
sanctified in Christ, either from the botom of our hearts amend, or else be
eternally loost with all our gostelie knolege for the ax is put to the rote of
the tree. So far is the malice of man procedid, that the Ire of god can be
nolenger differyd: a great time has the gospel been known of many men. Yet
the lief of the gospel as new to syk, as thowgh it were but now begone therefore
see we how God beginnyth again to permit the darkenys of error to over whylme
the worold, souch blindenis ever folowith the contempt of gods word, and the
unthankful receuing thereof. Tberfore as we be sanctified by Christ, so let us
bare him and sanctify him in our breasts or else we peryshe, To. 6. for faith
intendith and allways makyth have unto this port as Paul says. Tit. 2, ut
sancte, just ac pie uiuamus: men knowith not what the gospel is, they read it
as they read beuis of ha^pto^, or the gestes of Robin hode. If they may know
what the scripture says they judge it sufficient, where as it is clean
contrary men should not only read the scripture to be wyser but to be better we
bare the name of Christ, and confess him We must therefore be those persons in

Caput XI.
AS the scripture teachi^te Christ to be the ueri true prist and bishope the
church, prayth for the church, satisfies the Ire of god for the sin of the
church and only sanctifies the church. So doothe it prove Christ to be the
King Emperor and protector of the church. And that by thoffice and property
of a king that defendithe his subjects, not only by his godly laws, but also
by forse and civil resistance. As the Ennymies of his commune wealth shall
ministre occacio^. By those too menes every common wealth is preseruid as the
scripture teachith, princes Christenid and Ethnikes. Aristotelle in his
politikes. Iustiniane in the proeme of his institutions. The scripture every
where. Pharo that would this church of god and commune wealth of the
Israelites to be destroid, was loost and all his Army in the sea. the
idolaters that would make the common wealth of Christ's church one with the
common wealth of Egypt were destroyed, souche as Rebellid: Koreh and Rubinites
against the gouenrs of gods church Moses and Aron: were destroyed with the
artillyrie of gods ire, all the princes and nations that possessid the land of
Chanaan, god destroyed to set his common wealth in an order. In the later
days when the king of this commune wealth should be born the Angel declared
unto the blessid uirgine of what puissance and pour this Kingdom of Christ
should be. Regnabit inquit, in domo Jacob in aeternu^, and regni eius no^ erit
finis, Lu. 1. althow now the co^mu^e wealth of the church has no certain
place apointid where it shall remain. as it was appointid in thold law: yet
certain we be that this kingdon of Christ remaynith upon the earth and shall
do till the earth be burnyd, Matthew. 16. 28. 1 Corint. 15. How be it as Christ
wan and optaynyd this kyngdon in the later days with out shyld or spear so
doothe he preserve it with his holy sprit and not will carnal wepynes as
Christ said unto Pilate Joan. 18. Regnum meum, non est de hoc mu^do, Menyng
that he would not raygne in this worold as aprynce of this worold with pomp
and pride: but defend his people with his holy sprit, that the devil nether
the worold should not break there patience thowghe many afflictions and sorrows
should fight against them for the truithes sake. Christ doothe not deny to be
the king of the worold Before Pilate. But that he meant not to reign woroldlye
to the hindreaunc and defacyng of temperours dignite and title as the Jews
falsely accusid him as Cirillus libr. 12. capit. 10. in Iohannem says. and so
is the mind of saynct Augustine in the same place. This kingdom is spiritual:
Christ sitting at the right hand of God the father, praithe for us, yeuithe us
remission of sin^e and the holy ghost to fight and ouercom the worold Has
leffte here in the church his gospel thonly wepyn to fight with all for the
time of this mortal liefe Joan. 17. Where he definithe lyffe everlasting to be
the knolege of god. So does Paul To. 8. prove this kingdom to be spiritual.
And that concerning the body it apperith that Christ defendith not his people
because they live in souch disdain and aduersite: but here after it shall
appear as Paul says Col. 3. And Joan. 1. Io. 3. Nunc filij dei sumus, sed
nondum manifestum est quales erimus. This kingdom shall be ever persequutid till
the woroldes end Psalm. 2. 115. 71. Esaias the prophet describid the church of
this present lief sayng. Dabit uobis dominus panem arctu^, and aquam exiguam
and non auferet a te ultra doctorem tuu^ cap. 30. thus the church shall remain
but always in affliction. I know souche as fauorith not the truith will
interpretat my words that I condemn all princes and Kings as Ennymies of the
gospel because they peaceable enyoi there kingdo^es: so I wish the^ allwaies
so to do with harti prayer to the glory god. But of this one thing I will
assure every prince of the worold the more sincere he is in the cause of god
the more shall be his cross. I report me unto the Kings majesty that ded is
which at the first brount as soon as he took gods cause in hand, that Leopard
and dragon of Rome: did not only solicitat thole forene worold against him, but
also he suffryd souch an ungodly and detestable insurrection of his papyshe
subjects and other more crosses that never should have been mouyd, had he not
unquietid the best of her rest that sat above his maiesti and God also, in
this own Realm. they be flaterers of princes that say euerything may be ruled
with ease. they co^ consider not what an Ennymye of gods order the devil is:
that would not only the gospel of truith to be appressid, but also every
prince that studithe the preferment and setting fortb of gods word: the devil
never seasith to molest and unquiet every Godly polytyke and commune wealth
where there no scriptur divine to detect thart of the devil Aristotile in the
5. book of his politykes were sufficient to manifest the deuille ennymyte
against all comme wealths. farther the nature of man is infyrm and fare unable
to sustain the office of any uocacio^ be it polliticall, Ecclesiastical, or
domestical with out a singular aid of god Wese be saul that noble man who in
the beginning of his raygne did many noble acts, yet the devil got the
uictori in the end: his successor David was lik wyce so intanglid in the snares
of the devil, that with mouche pain he could quit him self from the wycchyd
coupe that the devil had ons browght him god Luk of: how be it god defendid
booth him and his kingdom so that, not only the preachers but also he himself
tawght the word of god unto the people as he had promisid Psalm. 6. 50. god
preseruithe above humane reason his ministres as he did Jacob from the hands
of Esau. David ffrom Saul, daniell from the lions, and Paul in the ship
where as no humane hope of salvation was at all but only the protection of god.
Those examples declare that he does defend his people against all the worold
by his mighr poor. Likewyce he gouernith this church with his only laws, and
would his subjects to know him: to honor him and to obey him as he has
co^maundid in his law Paul expressith this law Roma. 1. Euangelium uirtus dei
est in salutem omni credendi. Marci ultimo, Predicate Euangelium omni
creaturae. The only law wheru^to this congregation is bound is the gospel, as
Christ says Io. 14. Spiritus sanctus docebit uos omnia, and rediget uobis in
memoriam, omnia quae ego dixi uobis. Here Christ byndith the Apostelles and all
the church unto the things that he had tawght them. This common wealth of
the true church is knowyn by these too Marks the pure preaching of the
gospel and the ringht use of the sacraments thus prouith Paul Ephesios 2.
that the church is bound unto the word of god super fundamentum Apostolorum
and prophetarum extructi estis. Likwyse Esa. 59. Spiritus meus qui est in te,
and uerba mea quae posui in ore tuo, no^ recedent ab ore tuo, nec ab ore
seminis tui in aeternum. Of the right use of sacraments it is tawght 1. Cor.
11. Mar. ult. Luce ult. and Mat. ult. souche as teachith people to know the
church by these signs The traditions of men, and the succeffion of bishopes
teach wrong. Those too false opinions has yeuen unto the succession of
bishopes pore to interpretat the scripture, and pore to make souche laws in the
church as it pleacid them. There is noma^ has pore to interpretat the
scripture god for the preseruacion of his church doothe give unto certain
persons the giffte and knolege to open the scripture. But that yest is no pore
bound to any order succession of bishopes or title of dignite. Te princes of
the Earth does give always souche pore of civil Justice by succession, as
one is cheyffe justice for the time of his office to do every thing
appettayning unto the same, so has always his successor the like. God has
yeue^ the civil magistrates pour and auctorite to make souche laws for the
common wealth as shall be agreeable with reason and not against gods law and
like wyce pore to interpretat the same laws. But this is not to be admittid in
the church unto whom god has yeuen the gospel, and inter pretatyd the same
by his only son: tawght the mening and co^tentes thereof himself. To know
god, and his ire against sin, the greatnis of sin the justice yeuen in
Christ, the fere of god. The faith in his promises, the persequution of his
members. The ayed and help of god in aduersite, the resurrexion of the ded.
Where and what the true church is of Everlasting lief. Of the too natures in
Chtist of the father the son, and the holy ghost. These be contents of the
law where unto god has bound his church and commandyd here to hyre his son
conserning the interpretation of these points. And at the commandment of
Christ the Apostelles were sent to preach these uerites in the sprit of god.
It is therefore necessary to retain in the church the doctrine yeue^ unto us
by the Apostelles, and to be the disciples of there doctrine: and not to feign
interpretations of our own hedes co^trari unto there doctrine. Souche as will
be the me^bres of this church must be adisciple of the gospel and lern in
fere and humblenys of sprit tharticles of our religion as they be tawght there:
and not stand unto the iudge^t of any man what so ever hebe towghe he say
truithe: for his truithe is nothing except thauctorite of Gods word conteyne
the said truithe. it is a great confirmacion of our faith when we see souche
as were godly persons before us interpretat the scripture and use the
Sacraments as we do. As when the heresye of semo satenus troblid the
Christia^e brothers that said this word, uerbum in Johan In principio erat
uerbum, did not signify any person: nor substaynce deuyne. They were confyrmid
by the te testimony of Ireneus that hard Policar pus Johan the Evangelist
Disciple interpretat uerbu^ in the gospel for the sane of God second person in
Trinite. thowghe we be bound to hire the church to say the true and fayhfull
preachers of Gods word as was in this case Policarpus and Ireneus. Not with
sto^ding our faith: Is not grown did upon the authorite of the church. But in
and upon the uoyce of the gospel. we pray and inuocat the son^e of God second
person in Trinite. Because the scripture prouithe him to be god, Deus erat
uerbu^. Also: Pater meus usque modo operatur, and ego operor, sine me nihil
potestis facere. Item domine Jesus accipe spiritum meum. The aduersarijs of the
truithe defend many a false error under the Name of the holy church: therefore
thief treasons and secreat conspirisis must be taken head of. And when the
church is Named, diligently to consider when the articles, they would defend:
were acceptid of the church: by whom, and who was thauctor of them leave not
till the matter be brought unto the first original and most perfet church of
the Aposteles if thou find by there wrytinges that there church usid, the
thing that the preachet would prove then accept it or else not be not amasid
thou the speak of never many yers nor name never so many doctors, Christ and
his Aposteles be grant fathers in ayge to the doctors and masters in lerning,
repose thy self only the church that they have tawght the by the scripture:
fere nether of the ordinary pore or succession of bishopes ner of the greater
part. For if either the auctorite of bishopes or the greater part should have
pore to interpretat the scripture, the sentence of the pharisees, should have been
preferrid before the sentence of Zachary, Simion, Elizabet or the blyssid
uirgine consider that many time the true church is but a small congregation as
Esaias says Nisi deus reliquisset nobis semen, sicut Sodoma essemus. Therefore is
not the interpretation of the scripture obligatid unto an ordinary pore ner
the most part. As Noe Abraam, Moses, Samuel, David and Christ's time
testifies. Beware of decete when thou he rist the name of the church. The
uerite is then assaultyd they call the church of the devil, the holy church
many times. As Korahe and the rest of the people said unto Moses many times,
why have ye deceauid the people of god and browght them out of Egypt. They were
the church of god nothing the rather thowghe it was pentyd with this holy
title, but the church of the devil and a congregation of rebellious and
seditious persons as god declared both by word and fact. Moses callid not the^
the church of god but the church of Korahe, not the people of god but
rebellions and gods Ennymies as god declarid the^ to be by his cruel
revenging of them so many times had the most part been preferrid the^ the
truithe had been confundid and Moses and Aron put to death. Remember Christian
reader that the yeste of interpretation of the scripture is the light of the
holy ghost yeuen unto the humble and penitent person that sekethe it only to
honor god, and not unto those persons that accleme it by title or place by
cause he his a bishope, or folowid by succession Peter or Paul. Examine there
laws by the scripture and then shalt thou perceive they be the Ennymyes of
Christ's church and the uery church of Korahe. Remember the refore to examine
all kind of doctrine by the word of god. For souch as preach it aright has
there infirmites and ignorancy, they may depart from the truithe: or else buld
some superstition and false doctrine, upon the gospel of Christ superstition
is to be auoy did false doctrine to be abhorrid who so ever be thauctor there of
prince magistrate or bishope. As the Apostelis made answer Acto. 5. Oportet
magis obedire deo qua^ hominibus. The superior pour has autorite and may
make what laws the list for the wealth and preservation of there subjects so
it repugnat the law of nature nor the law of god but as touching the church of
Christ which gouernith the soul of man only the law of god must be obedied.
The ceremonies ordeinid for a godd order to be obseruid in the church should
not be neglectid as the assemblau^s of people in the sabbath day and other
festes wherein the word of god is preachid and he sacraments rightly ministrid.
But ^ese ceremonies that partly supersticion, partly auaryce partly tyranny
has browght into the church ar to be eschuyed, as the sayng of private masses
blessing of water, bowgh bread, bell or candell with souch like. As for the
prayng unto dead saynctes or to have there imagis in te church it is not a
ceremony matter. But uery plain and manifest Idolatry, contrary unto the
express word of god who forbid dith to make any ymagie and he that prayth unto
God in the name of any ded saynct is an Ethnic and knowith not god. For he
folowith his imagination and not the word of god who teachith and commaundith
that we should booth know and pray unto him in his sons name Joan. 14. the
neglecting of this commandment deseruith eternal pains. Souch as has a
knolege of Christ from hensforthe let them give him his right honor and leave
this Idolatry and supersticion. Considering that with great pain he wan the
church out of the hands of the devil defendith it with his holy sprit and
gouernith it with the laws of his only word. And consider whether these
injuries, blasphemis, troble, unquietnis and destruction of gods people by the
law of the bishopes be to be permittid thowghe they cry till they be horse
agai^e the holy church the holy church. Were the like troble in any realm
among the kings subjects by the occacion and abuse of the kings maiestis
laws, doutles could they not show under the kings seal there law to be of
auctorite. they should as right is son be put to silence, and there adulterous
laws and sophistical glosses remouid out of the way thus I know that Christ
knew best all the histories of the old law, was the present teacher himselff
of all uerite and most wise to provide for the church souch laws as should
preserve it in his absens.

NOw that we know what Christ, and his office is in the church of god. It is
likewyce necessary for every man that is Amembre of this church to know what
manne is, and his office toward Christ for as god has bound himself by his
promise to be our god and helper for Christ, so has he bound man by his
commandment to be his servant and in his word to follow Christ and in Christ
god for the commandments sake until souche time as thend wherefore man was
made be optaynid, which is eternal foelicite and man restoryd and made like

Mark the trauyce and pley between the law of God, and the conscience of Paul

a spiritual and holy thing, as a light or torche to show man his ffylthy and
stynking nature: sayng lex spiritualis est: at ego carnalis sum, uenditus sub

what amiserable wrecche man is, and how man may know his miseri by the law. How
be it thowghe we read it many times we be nether the wyser, nether the better,
we be not tawght a dele by this mistres the law, she cannot make us good
scolers we daly and play so with the worold, we live in souche securite and
ease, that say she what she list we torn the deffe ear and will not hyre:
therefore to make man to know himself god sentithe an other mystres to scole
man, scilicet aduersite, then we begin to undrestond the law of god that
disswadithe from sin, and we then know our misery. As David Criethe that he
is notable to bare the burdon of sin if the lord execute justice as the
greatnis thereof meritithe, Si iniquitates obseruaueris dn^e, qs sustinebit?
Psalm. 130. David when he felt the pains of his adultery, the death of his
chyldre the conspyricie of Absolon, the uiciating of his wives, exile and
banyshement and souche other calamites. In this scole of misery he lernyd this
uerse. Who can sustain the ire of god? Now thowghe these temporal pains be
more then man ca^ support: they be but sport and dalyance in respect of the
pains aeternall: How be it man may lern by them how mouche God is displeacyd
with sin and know himself to be as he is, a uile peace of earth, with all
his pride and pomp. And A rebellion unto his maker as no creatur else is saving
the devil, and he: this innword and secreatyle. Rebellion of the heart,
blindnis of the inthinte^deme^t, and frawardnys of will is daily augmentid by
the malice of the devil and our own negligence that regardithe not what the
law teachithe God reguyrithe of man. Because the gospel teachithe we are only
sauyd by the mercy of God, for the merits of Christ our gospellers has set
all at liberty, and carith not at all of souche liefe as should and awght to
follow eueri justified man and disciple of Christ: it is no meruell for there is
no discipline and ponyshment for sin, and where so ever the gospel be
preachid and this correction not usid as well against the high is as the lowist
there shall be never agodly church. as a kings army towghthe hearts be never
so good cannot resist the forse of his Ennymyes with out weapon and artillery
necessary for men of war, no more can the kings maiesti the magistrates and
preachers preseruethe church against the devil and sin with out
thexcommunication of souche as openly offend the divine maiesti of god and his
word for by this means the sinner is tawght by the scripture to know himself.
1. Cor. 5. co^gregatis uobis and meo spiritu, una cu^ potestate domini nostri
Jesus Christi, ut is qui hoc patrauit tradatur sathanae ad interitum carnis, ut
spiritus saluus sit in die domini nostri Jesus Christi. God would not only the
fideles, but also the infideles to be kept `in an order by the discipline of
the law, as Paul says, Lex est iniustis posita lik wyce Deuteronomy. 19. Auferes
malum, ut audientes reliqui timorem habeant, non miseriaris eius. This
political and civil use of the law teachith man to know his faults and this
discipline of the law exterior and civil is necessary for man for diverse
causes. ffyrst to declare our obedience unto god. Then to auoyed the
punishment that allwaies god, or else the magistrate reuengithe the
transgression. Thyrdly because of apuplike peace in every commune wealth that
the one should not do injuries to the other, nether in body, ner in gods. There
is yet an other cause why this discipline of the law is necessary which few
men regard Paul says that it is a scole mystres. Pedagogia unto Christ
because souche as leuithe not to sin and to do the thing contrary unto the
express word of god: to those Christ is not profetable this use teachite Paul
1. Cor. 6. Fornicatores Idolatre, adulteri etc. regnum dei no^ possidebunt. And
so says Johan, Omnis qui peccat exdiabolo est. He that knowithe himself must
refrain from doing of isle. Hyre the gospel: and lern the gospel: that the
sprit of god may be efficatious in him which cannot be as long as he has a
purpose to continue in doing of isle. Ezechiel spekyth of this use civil and
politic of the law: and likwyce of the second use thereof which is as I said
before to show man his sin, to accuse man before God, to fere him and to
damme man plainly capit. 33, Viuo ego nolo mortem peccatoris: sed ut uiuat, and
conuertatur. These words declare that as God would not the death of a sinner,
so he requirythe the sinner to cease from doing of isle and to be conuertyd unto
uertew. as for the second use of the law which is to declare what sin is I
shewid before that it manifestith the greatnys and uilnys there of as Paul
writithe, it damnith sin and deliuerythe not from sin: per legem (inquit)
cognitio peccati. Lex iram efficit: per legem peccatum fit excellenter reum.

sin^e it auaylithe not, he thinkithe that God is a sleep and will at last be
pleacid with afygg for sin we shall find the contrary to our great pain, as
other has before our time, that would not belyue the word: till the felt the
uenge^ce and punishment of god, as Caim the drownyd world with the flud. the
burning of Sodoma with other. It is agreat and horrible offense to hide or
extenuat the judgment of god against sin, and the uoyce of the law that
co^demnit the same. God willith his pleasure to be knowyn openly Hier. 1.

said that the fere of gods didispleasure and Ire was no less pain unto him,
then thowgh the fyrse lion had rent and dismembrid his body in pieces: sicut Leo
contriuit omnia ossa mea Psalm. 22. So says Paul, O infelix ego homo quis me
eripiet ab hoc corpore morti obnoxio. He that befote said, Ego aliquando
uiuebam sine lege, id est, fui securus, non sentiens ira^ dei. Now conuertid
from a Pharisie to be and Apostell, and browght to a knolege of himself. He
confessythe his inbecillite and faults and says. Noui quod non habitet in me,
hoc est in carne mea bonum, yet Paul confessith that the law makyth us not a
ferd to be damnyd because we cannot satisfy it: but that we should com to
Christ with these confortabe words. Conclusit omnes sub peccato ut omnium
miseratur Agreat consolation for every troblyd conscience: thus man may know
himself to be as he is a uery wrecchid and damnable creature were not the
uertew of Christ's death.

Caput XIII.
WHat thoffice of a justified man is Paul declarithe Tit. 2. Apparuit enim
gratia salutifera omnibus hominibus erudiens nos, ut abnega impietate and
mundanis co^cupiscentijs, sobrie, pie, ac just uiuamus in hoc saeculo. Be
these words Paul for biddithe all impiete and dishonest lief and shewithe man
that is justified what he should do. Not to live after the concupiscens of the
flesh but soberlye. Not uniustly and doing wrongs unto other: but rather to
Prophet and do well unto all men. It sufficithe not man iustli to keep his
gods, But he is bound justly to dispense his gods with other whether they
be of the body or of the mind religiously and not superstitiousli. anotable
word (pie inquit) as the word of god teachith and not as man's laws contrary
unto gods law teachithe Expectantes beatam spem etc. he prouokith men to live
well and takithe his reason of the profet and co^modite that folowith agodly
lief which is immortal lief at the cumming of Christ to judgment: Likewyce
with an other argument, a liberatione Christ petitum and ab honesto dedit
semetipsum pro nobis etc. the son^e of god gave nether gold nor silver for our
purgacion but his awnebody and precions bludd: it is therefore an unwourthie
thing and not beco^ming a Christian man that by fay the has receuid this
purgation to live a uitious and ungodli liefe. But we should be an holy people
and folowers of good works. There is a great uertew in this word zeloten it is
not, sufficient to work well: Except the justified man with agodly zeal and
ardent desire follow this godd work be gone. Therefore Paul says zelote^
calo^ ergo^ etno^ operatore^ bonoru^ operu^ whereby we know that all thowgh we
be delivered from the malediction, course and damnation of the law (so that we
reteyne a true faith and with confidence in Christ, repugne sin, and over
com the terrors thereof) yet ar we bound to the obedience of the law, which is
Gods will to keep us from living ille, and the more the justified man
beholdithe the law the more incresithe the knolege of sin, the more he
beholdithe the mercy of God in Christ, the more is his fay the incresith. the
lawis also necessary for theiustified man to teach hi^ withewhat works he
should exetcise his faith with all, and obedience unto God. We may not chose
works of our own wysdom to serve with all. But would us to be gouernyd by
his word as David says: Lucerna pedibus meis uerbum tuum. Also: Frustra me
colunt, mandatis hominum. The wysdom of man not gouernyd by the word of God
doothe sone err. It is caryd for the most part with affections and chosithe
the works that be contrary to the law of god. There fore this is true, that
the ordinance of God still remanithe in the justified man immutable, that he
must obey the law, and serve in his uocacion according to the scripture, that
the exterior factes may bare testimonye of the inward reconciliacion. The
scripture is more diligent and more ample in teaching, the Christian justified
man the obedience unto God and uertews liefe, then it is to show us our
salvation in Christ: for this purpose only that we should not: by our
lice^tious liberty receive the grace of god inuayne it is more hard for man to
know the gospel the^ to follow the liefe of the gospel, an other man may
preach Christ, but the auditour must follow Christ, the sciens of the scripture
is practiue and not speculatiue, it requirithe a doer, and not a speaker only.
there be many that dissemblith faith, and has a certain show of religion
when indede in the inward man is nofaithe at all: let every man therefore sarche
his own conscience with what faith he is endued and remember that Christ
said it is a straight way and narow, that ledithe to liefe Math. 7. and but a
few that walkithe there in. therefore our only remedy is to pray for grace and
amend.
