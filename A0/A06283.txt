WORSHIPFVLL,
THe cause of your repair hither at this present, is to give you knowledge,
That you are elected by the Governors of this Hospital, and allowed by the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen, to the office, charge, and governance of the
hospital of Bridewel, and house of correction; and to remain and continue
Governors there, in the room and place of them that were before you.
Therefore this is to require you, and every of you, (in Christian charity)
That you endeavor your selves with all your wisdom and power, faithfully and
diligently to serve in this your Vocation and Calling, which is an Office of
high trust and Worship: For you are called to be the faithful and true
Distributers of your Judgment, Justice, and Mercy; which are most commendable
blessings from the most high Judge. In which Office and Calling, if you be
found endeauoursome, just, and faithfully, you shall not only be, and declare
your selves to be the most thankful and worthy stewards and servants of your
Almighty Lord and master (being put in trust to see vice and Idleness
corrected, and Virtue nourished and maintained, relieuing the Poor, and doing
justice) but also you shall show your selves to be very notable and worthy
Members and helpers in that work, which most highly does advance and beautify
the Commonwealth of this Realm, and chiefly of this City of London. For by
this commendable and notable policy, Idleness (the Enemy of all Virtue) is
suppressed and banished; the sturdie idle Beggar, wandering Rogue, and lewd
Arrogant idle Strumpet, and lustful Youth, is compelled to travel in profitable
exercises, and set to work, and admonished of their lewd, vicious wandering,
idle, and adulterous kind of life, and refreshed with charity. This is
therefore to require you and every of you, in charity, and duty of a
profitable Commonwealths man, That you here promise before God, and this
Assembly of the Worshipful your fellow Governors, faithfully to travel and
endeavor your selves in this your Office which you are called unto; that this
Work may have his perfection, and that in Justice and grave Discretion you
proceed to the correction of vice and Idleness: and to provide, that the needy
number of poor Children committed to your charge, be diligently, and in
charity wholsomely provided for; as you will answer before God, at the time
when you and every one of us shall stand before his Tribunal Seat, where
every good Christian shall render his account of their doings. And in hope you
will this do, you are here admitted into this Worshipful Society and
Fellowship.

God save the King.
