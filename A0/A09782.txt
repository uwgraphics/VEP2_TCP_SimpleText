To the right Honorable, William Rider, Lord Mayor of the City of London. T.
B. wishes all health and happiness.
RIght Honorable, having happened (of late) upon this Discourse, no less
pleasant to be read, then profitable to be practiced; and considering how
unworthy a part it were, to send so worthy a work, unto the view of the world,
both namelesse, and friendless; I bethought my self of some Mecaenas, that
should undertake the defense of it against the raging storms of carping
Momistes: At last, I resolved upon your Honor, whom piety and Justice has
made famous and renowned amongst all men. Wherefore I now humbly present the
same unto your good Lo. to be intertayned, as you shall find it worthy. In the
mean time, commending both it and my self unto your honorable protection, I
commit t^ your honor to the tuition of the Almighty.

Unto your Honor most humbly devoted, T. B.

Inimicus Amicus. An excellent Treatise, showing, how a man may reap profit
by his Enemies.
I Can not but perceive how that thou (my dearest Cornelius Pulcher) haste made
choice of the most pleasing course of life that may be; wherein thou do
affoorde no less profit to the Commonwealth, wherein thou live, then
courtesy to thy particular friends, with whom thou conuersest. But for so much
as a Land may be found void of all venomous creatures, as men report of the
Island of Creete, but hitherto there was never any Commonwealth heard of, which
was clean destitute of envy, emulation, and contention, three fruit full
nursing mothers of enmity: for, if there were no other cause, yet even
friendship it self will soon entangle us with many enmities: which Chilo the
wise man considering, demanded of one who vaunted, that he had never an
enemy, whether withal, he had any one friend. Whereupon it seems to me,
that a States man amongst other things which he should know concerning his
enemies, ought not carelessly to give ear to the saying of Zenophon, that it
belongs to a wise man even to reap profit by his enemies. Therefore having
comprised together in a little Treatise, that which not long before I had
discoursed of, I have sent it thee, almost word for word as it was uttered,
omitting all precepts of Political government written by me, as knowing that
book of mine to be seldom out of your hands.

Former Ages thought it sufficient to keep themselves untouched from the rage
of all strange and wild beasts, and this only was the end of all their
combat with them: But in these our days men having at length learned how to
make use of them, now they do even reap manifold commodities by them, as
being nourished by their bodies, clothed by their wool, medicined by their
gall, and other entrails; and lastly, armed with their skins, so that now
we may justly fear, lest that through want of wild beasts, man's life do
wax altogether brutish, defective, and savage: since then it suffices some,
not to be injured of their ennemies: but yet others, of the wiser sort, it
becomes even to reap profit by them, as Zenophon gives counsel, we must
not therefore be incredulous, but rather, search out the Method and the Art
how to be able to attain to that perfection, very needful for such who can
not live without some ennemies. The husbandman can not frame every tree
according to his mind, nor the hunter tame every wild beast, yet both have
found means ^owe, the one, by barren trees, the other, by wild beasts, might
receive much profit: Sea water is no less unsavory then unwholesome, and yet
it nourishes fish, and affoords convenient passage to transporte whatsoever
profitable were. The Satyr, at the first sight of fire, would needs have
kissed and embraced it: but Prometheus in the Poet checked him with this verse:
Thou hairie goat,
from touch of fire abstain,
Lest that thy beardlesse chinne
too late complain.


And yet it gives light, and yields heat; yea it is a most needful help
to the skillful use, in what Art soever. Let us likewise consider our ennemy
(though otherwise he be altogether hurtful and intractable) whether
perchance one may touch him gently, use him wisely, and reap good by him
profitably. There be many things which are grievous, burdensome, and
contrary to the nature of those on whom they light, and yet you see how that
even sickness it self gives some good occasion to live at ease, and how
that much turmoyle befalling to others, has been both a strengthening, and a
practice of their patience: yea more, even the loss of goods and banishment
has occasioned some, as, Diogenes and Crates, to betake themselves to the
study of of Philosophy.

As for Zeno, when he heard news of his shipwreck, presumed to say, I thank
thee good Fortune, that thou have drouen me to a poor Studients gown. For
even as the beasts of the best constitution, and of good digestion, devour and
concoct Serpents and Scorpions, yea, some are so nourished, through the
extreme heat of their stomachs, and good temperature of their Spirits, with
stones and shell-fishe, whereas weak and queasie stomachs are ready to
vomit, with tasting either bread or wine: even so do the unwise spoil
friendship it self, whereas men of understanding can make no small use, even
by their ennemies.

Therefore first it seems to me, that that very thing which is most
hurtefull in enmity, may become most profitable to men of discretions but by
what means shall that come to pass you will say? For thine ennemie carefully
watching, does narrowely observe all thy actions, and on every side does
curiously pry into thy life, gaping after every occasion of harming, and
does, not only as the beast Lynx by his sight, pierce through trees, stocks,
and stones, but does search out thine actions, and undermine thine
enterprises, and that even by thy servants, friends, kinsfolks, and familiar
acquaintance: for oftentimes our friends, through our negligence and delay,
are sick, and even dead before we are aware of it, whereas through our
overmuch curiosity, we can hardely forbear from hearkening even after the
very dreams of our ennemies. But as for thy sickness, debts, or domestical
^arres with thy wife, they will be sooner concealed from thy self, then from
thine ennemie, yea above all, he will pursue thy faults, and trace after them
most daungerously. And even as vultures do follow the smell of dead
carcasses, as not able for to take the sent of pure and wholesome bodies, in
like manner, the wounds and distempered affections incident in our life, do
waken our ennemies. And to these come rushing our ill-willers, and violently
take hold of them, and rip them up.

Therefore it is most expedient for thee to live very circumspectly, to take
heed to thy self, and neither say, nor do, any thing rashly, or unadvisedly:
but rather, to lead thy life, as it were keeping an exact diet, without blame,
or reprehension whatsoever: for this heedefulnesse so repressing the passion of
our minds, and keeping Reason within her bounds of duty, does frame a
careful desire, and settled purpose, to live uprightly and blamelesly: for
even as Cities well taught and tempered with the continual wars of their
next neighbors, do learn good discipline, and embrace a good and well ordered
government of their commonweal: even so those, which through others enmities
are constrained to have aneve to their life, to abstain from carelessness and
negligence, and to do all things with a kind of careful dexterity, being
led with custom, themselves scarce perceiving it, they do incline to a
course of life void of error, and do settle their behavior, and adorn
their manners, with very little help of learning: for they who have at hand
that verse of Homer, How then (alas)
would Priamking of (Troy,
And Priams sons
be filled with scorning joy.


Are thereby withdrawn and dehorted from all things which might minister to
their enemies any occasion of rejoicing or laughter: we see oftentimes how that
players and musitions in the Theaters, if they be alone by themselves, do play
their parts carelessly, and without alacrity, but being once in strife and
emulation, with any others, they do not only endeavor themselves to excel, but
take care to have their Instruments in exceeding good order, to tune them
choicely, and to frame their consort most (...) and absolute: even so he t^^t
knows that his enemy is a jealous enuier both of h^^ life and ^^^^^^tion,
will presently look more narrowly to himself (...) ^xamine his actions more
exactly, and frame his ^^fe more orderly, (...) i^ the p^oper^^e of vice, that
when w^ offend, we stand in awe more of our enemies then of our friends:
whereupon Nasica, whenas many supposed and affirmed, that the Roman comonweale,
was now placed in a secure estate, whenas both the Carthaginians were utterly
destroyed, and the Achaians brought under the yoke of bondage, nay rather
(quoth he) we are in most dangerat this very time, having none left us, whom we
might, either fear for danger, or who should keep us in awe. And hereunto the
saying of Diogenes no less agreeing to Policy, then Philosophy, who being
asked of one, how he might be avenged of his enemies: why (quoth he) in being a
virtuous and honest man; if men see their enemies horses or dogs much
esteemed and set by, it will mol^st their minds, and if they chance to see
their enemies field well tilled, or their garden well prospering, it causes
them to fetch many a deep sigh: what then would they do trowest thou, if thou
show thy self to be a just, prudent, and honest man, in thy words well
advised, in thy actions unspotted, and in thy diet most temperate.

Having deep furrows
graven in thy mind,
From whence each counsel grave
does spring by kind
The Poet Pindarus says, that men vanquished have their tongues so bound, that
they dare not offer to hiss, but yet not simply: neither all are so, but they
chiefly that perceive themselves to be overcome by their enemies, in industry,
in goodness, in magnanimity, in humanity, in many benefits: these be the
things (says Demosthenes) which restrain the tongue, which seal up the
mouth, which stop the breath, and cause silence.

All wicked men in virtue to excel,
It does befit a wise man very well.
If thou will greatly grieve thine enemy, do not accuse him of his wanton
behavior, of his effeminate mind, of intemperance, of his scurrillitie, of
his couetousness but in the mean while, be thou thy self a man of courage,
chaste, loyal, courteous, and just, amongst those with whom thou live: but
if thou chance to go so far as to speak ill of him, see that those things
which to him thou obiectest, be far from thine own self; sift and examine
thine own soul, search out every corner thereof, wherein thou art faulty,
least even thine own guiltines gall thee, with that verse of the tragical Poet.

(To heal all others (fool)
thou do not stick,
Whenas thy crazie corpse
is weak and sick.
If thy enemy term thee unlearned, strive to show thy uttermost endeavors and
diligence; if fearful, stir up thy valor and corrage, if lascivious, wipe
clean out of thy mind, that little remaining impression of wantonness
secretly lurking therein: for there is nothing more shameful, nothing more
odious, then a slander retorted upon the aucthor thereof; but even as the
refracted light does more hurt the weak eyesight, even so reprehensions
justly redounding back, do most of all grieve the evil speaker: for as the
wind called Caecias draws unto it clouds, so a vicious life breeds all
reports: therefore Plato, as often as he kept company with any, who unseemly
behaved themselves, withdrawing himself in private, was wont to say to
himself: what, am I such a one? so he which has slandered an other man's life,
if by and by he do examine and well order his own, thereby forming and framing
it to a contrary mould, he shall reap some commodity by his slander, which
otherwise both seems, and is altogether vain and unprofitable. It seems to
most men most rediculous, if a crooke-backe or bald-pate do reproach or
vpbrayde another with the same imperfections; but it deserves more then
ordinary laughter, if a man do mock and reproach another with that wherewith he
himself may justly be mocked and reproched, like unto that which Leo Emperor
of Byzantium answered unto a certain crooke-backe, which iested at his bleare
eyes, saying, thou reprochest me with defect of nature, and thou carriest
Nemesis upon thy back, therefore do not thou object adultry to an other, thy
self madding after the love of boys; nor yet prodigallitie, they self being
a niggard. Alemaeon in the Poet checked Adrastus in this sort.

Thy cruel sister
Did her husband slay.
What then did Adrastus? he would not cast in his teeth an other bodies fault,
but even his own, thus:

But thine own hand
Thy mother made away.
So also Domitius reproching Craessus, said, did not thou weep for the death
of thy Lamprey which thou norishedst in thy pond? whereupon Craessus replied,
did not thou bury three wives without one tear? wherefore he that
reprocheth, must not be witty in his own conceit, loud in his voice, and lewd
in his talk, but rather blameless and faultlesse in his life: for it seems
that even God himself has to no one so much enjoined this golden precept
(Know thy self) as unto him, who is about to reproach another; least speaking
what he would, he hear that which he would not, for such a one (as
Sophocles the tragic Poet tells us.)

Whose willing tongue
has filled each iching ear,
Unwillingly
like slanders needs must hear.
Behold now what profit there is in reproching our enemies, and yet there is no
less commodity received by being reproched of our enemies. Wherefore
Antisthenes said not amiss, that those that would live free from vice, have
need either of most unfeigned friends, or of most bitter enemies, because those
by their admonitions, and those by their reproaches, do withdraw him from vice,
and because that now a days friendship is become feeble in reprehending
freely, talkatiue in flattering, and mute in admonishing, we must learn the
truth, even of our enemies. For even as Telephus, when among his own friends,
he found-none to cure his wound, permitted his enemy to do it: so must he
that has not a friend to correct him, suffer the reprehension of his enemy,
having regard rather to the deed it self, then to the mind of the
reprehender: and even as he who purposed to kill Prometheus the Thessalian,
opened his impostume with his sword, and by that means both saved his life,
and cured him of his disease: even so very often a taunt, which either anger or
enmity has cast upon us, does salve some wound of our soul, either unknown
through ignorance, or unregarded through negligence: but the most part of men
consider not the truth of the reproach objected, but endeavor rather to find
some fault in the person reproaching, and so, much like wrastlers, they do not
wipe from themselves the dust of reproaches, but rather besprinkle others with
the same; and so go grapling with them, themselves overthrowing one another:
yea rather he that is noted for some crime by his enemies, if it be true, by
and by he ought with far more diligence to purge it away, then a man would
wipe out of his garment any apparent spot or blemish: but if false, then we
ought to enquire out the cause, which was the cause of the fault finding, and
withal, he must fear, and take good heed, least he committed any thing at
vnawaies, any way like, or near to that for which he was reproched; as for
example: Lacides King of Argos was accounted somewhat lascivious, only for his
sleeke looks and mincing gate: so Pompey, albeit, a man far from all lust
and effeminaties, because he used to scratch his head with one finger: was
noted with the same crime: so Cr^ssus was thought to have abused one of the
vestall virgins, by reason of a farm which he greatly desired to buy of her,
and for that cause, to obtain his content, he very often conuersed with her
apart: so Posthumia, because she was so given to laughter, and somewhat forward
in talking with men, was suspected of her honesty, and that so far forth,
that she was accused thereof openly in the court, but in the end, being found
guiltless, and acquitted by Spurius Minutius, being then high priest, she had
this caueate of him, that hereafter she should not use words unsuitable to her
life: so Themistocles, by Pausanius, although most clear in himself, was
suspected of treason, as using him friendly, and writing and sending often to
him. Therefore when a false thing is objected, it must not be neglected and
contemned as being a lie, but rather we must search out, if either we, or any
of our friends, have spoken, or done, or attempted any such things, which might
carry some likelyhoode of that slander, and so warily to avoid it: for if
others, by falling into unexpected miseries, do learn their own good, as
Meropa in the Poet speaks: Whiles Fortune blind
depriues my hapless eyes
Of dearest joys,
at length she makes me wise.


What does hinder us that we should not accept of a master that takes no
wages, but instructs gratis, to wit even an ennemie, to be profited by him,
and learn something which before we knew not: for an enemy does perceive
many things far better than a friend, because a lover (as says Plato) is
even blinded with the affection of the person beloved, whereas hatred, besides
curiosity, has for his companion, an affected desire of prattling, whenas one
of the enemies of Hiero reproched him with his stinking breath: he going home
to his wife, questioned with her sharply, saying, What means this, that thou
never toldst me of this before? She no less chaste than harmless, answered,
she thought al men had the same savor: So that those things, which either
pertayne to the body, or belong to any sense, or else be apparent in all men's
sights, are sooner known by a man's ennemies, than by his friends or familiars.
Besides, it is not possible so to bridle the tongue (which is not the least
part of Virtue) as, to frame it to be always obedient, and controlde by
Reason, unless a man by much practice, by great care, and by all earnest
endeavors, do strive for to subdew those rebellious passions of the mind,
amongst which Anger bears not the least sway: for a word which unwittingly
does break out of the mouth, as it is in the Poet: My dearest child,
what speech strange and uncouth,
Has burst from out
the fenc^d walls of thy mouth?


When such words (I say) fly carelessly out of themselves, they do as it were,
slide and slip away most commonly from unexercised, and unsettled minds:
which, when it happens, it argues great weakness of mind, much
distemperature of judgment, with no less savage strangeness of behavior, in
as much as for a man's speech, a thing, of it self, of least account (as we
read in divine Plato) both by the gods, and by men, a most grievous punishment
is allotted, whereas silence is always without danger: neither only (as
Hipocrates says) does it prevent thirst, but above all, being wisely used,
when we are reproached, it preserves a kind of gravity altogether
Socraticall, call, or rather Herculean, for Hercules, as it is in the Poet: --
Card not a fly
for all backebiting terms.


Neither surely is it more laudable or godly to be quiet at the rebuke of our
enemies, and to sail carelessly by it, as by a dangerous rock, but practice of
our patience is far more to be affected: For, if thou art once inured to
bear patiently a contumelious ennemy, thou will easily suffer the rage of thy
railing wife, thou will less be troubled with the bitter check of thy
brother or friend: yea more, thou will sustain even the scourge of thy
parents, without any commotion of thy mind: for Socrates did forbear Xantippe
his wife, being a very froward and wayward woman, because he thought he
might better converse with others, if he were accustomed to forbear with her:
but it is much more excellent to be able to tolerate calamity, as being
fore-prepared by long exercise the opprobrious taunts and reuilings of our
enemies Py this means we make show of our mild disposition, and unmoved
patience, even toward our enemies: for here is a more use of simplicity, of
an high erected spirit, and of gentleness, then even in friendship it self.
For it is not so commendable, to do well to a man's friend, as it is shameful,
not to do it in time of his need: so that, to let slip the occasion of
revenging our ennemie, being offered, argues much humanity. But he that has
a fellow-feeling compassion of his afflicted enemy, who helps his necessities
who shows mercy to his distressed children, and vnderproppeth his decaying
family, whosoever does not both love him for his courtesy, and praise him for
his goodness, that man (as the Poetsaieth) Sure has abreast
hewne out of Adamant,
A man may take profit
And heart ^^^amde
of peerless Diamant.


When Caesar commanded the overthrown monuments of Pompey, to be again set
up, Cicero told him, that in erecting the Trophies of Pompey, he had
established his own. Therefore a man must not spare to praise his very ennemy,
and to honor him too, if he do deserve it: for the commender is thereby more
praise-woorthy, and better to be believed whenever he reprehendeth, as not
hating the man, but reproouing the matter: but that which is yet most
profitable and excellent, is, that he, who does once accustom himself to
praise even his enemy, and never grieves, nor enuies his prosperous success,
that man must needs be far estranged from grudging and envying at the
prosperity of his friends and familiars, and (I pray you) what exercise can
possible work so much good for our souls, or frame our disposition better,
than that which clean takes away that too much affected humor of envy and
emulation.

For even as in a City there be many things necessary, though otherwise not so
good, which being once allowed by custom, and confirmed by force of law,
cannot be easily abolished, how pernicious soever they be; even so, enmity
acompanies, with hatred, with envy, with a delight in other men's harms, and
with the memory of received injuries, and yet leaves them all in the mind:
besides all these, enters in fraudulent dealing, deep deceipts* and perfidious
treacheries, as presupposing these things may lawfully be used toward our
enemies: and then being ingraffed, they can by no means be rooted out with
headstrong affections, if we do not curb them, in conuersing with our
enemies, it is to be feared, lest being overcome by custom, we use them even
with our friends: if then Pithagoras did very well, in accustoming his
Disciples, even in unreasonable creatures, to abstain from cruelty and
injuries, so that he would entreat both fowlers and fishers, to let go the one
his birds, the other his fish, being taken; or at the least redeemed them with
money and so let them loose; yea and forbade the slaughter of any tame heast
whatsoever: much more glorious questionless were it, if that even being
enemies, in contentions and iarres between man and man, we would show our
selves to be noble minded, upright, and true hearted, by controuling, and
repressing all vile degenerate, and hurtefull passions of our minder; to the
intent, that in conuersing with our friends, our patience may be immovable and
our selves abstayning from all manner of wickedness. Scaur^^ was Domit^^^ private
enemy, and public accuser, yet when as before the judgment day a certain
servant of Domitius came to Scaurus, as being about to tell him somewhat
against his master, he would not suffer him to speak, but apprehending him,
sent him back to his master: so likewise Cato accusing Murena of bribery, in
suing for offices, and gathering together proofs to confirm his accusation,
in the mean season there followed him at his heels (according to the fashion
of those times) certain men who spied out all his proceedings and asked him
now and then, whether he purposed to do any thing touching the accusation that
day or no, if he had said no, they presently believed it, and went their way:
and this surely was a strong argument of that great estimation which they had
of Ca^o; and yet it is far more laudable, if being envied, to deal justly eue^
with our utter enemies, we never either unjustly defraude, or craftily
circumuent our friends and acquantance. But since that every lark has his
crest (according to the saying of Simouides) so every man's nature is bent to
contention, emulation, and envy, the inseparable follower of vayne-minded men
(as Pindarus speaks) it were no small profit if a man would pour out such
like affections upon his enemies, as it were by certain channels, to drive
them far from our neighbors and companions: which thing Onomademus an
excellent Stats-man seemed to have thoroughly considered, who in a great tumult
which arose in the Island of Chios, being one of the superior faction,
counseled his fellows, that they should not expel al their adversaries, but
still leave some in the City (least said he) otherwise being void of all our
enemies, we should begin to quarrel with our friends: besides, these humors
being spent upon our enemies, they will less greiue our friends; for the
potter needs not envy the potter: (as the Poet Hosi^^^^ says,) nor the
musician the musician, nor the neighbor be jealous of his neighbor, or
kinsman, or brother now beginning to prosper. But if no way may be found,
whereby thou may be free from strife, envy, and contentions, at least frame
thy self, to grieve at the happy success of thine enemies, and stir up that
contentious edge, by sharpening and whetting it on thy enemies, for even as
handsome Gardeners, imagine that roots and violets will prosper the better,
being set by garlic and onions, because all that whatsoever is filthy and
unsavory in the norishment of the earth, is derived into th^^, even so our
enemy, drawing to him, self, and receiving all our rancor and malice, will
make us more tractable and loving to our friends in their prospentie.
Therefore we must contend with our enemies for glory for power, or any lawful
increase of our wealth, and not only abstain from repining, if they go beyond
us in any thing, but rather observe the means whereby they have excelled us,
and endeavor to surpass them in industry, in constancy of labors, and in
temperance: yea let us be our enemies jealous obseruers, in that sort as
Themistocles was wont to say, that Milti^^^^ victory in Marathon bereaved him
of his sleep: for those which think that their enemies do ouerpasse them,
either in public charge, or in pleading, or in governing the commonwealth, or
else in the favor of princes, or multitude of friends; those men if they convert
a glorious kind or practical emulation into a certain dejected and
base-minded repining, they are vexed with an idle and fruitless envy, but he
that is not blinded with the hatred of his enemy, but as an vncorrupt and
impartial spectator, does behold his manners, his sayings, his doings, he
shall perceive that the most part of those things which he enuyed in him, were
gotten by his dilligent providence, and good carriage; and thereby aiming at
the end, he will increase his good desire of honesty and glory, and cutting
off each vain and slothful affection. But if our enemies, by flattering, by
subtle dealing, by suites in law, by taking of bribes, do get any credit or
rep^^^tio^, either in court, or common-woule, that shall not only give us any
occasion of grief, but even gift us very much, by opposing against them the
liberty of our mind, and the pur^^es of our life, free from al reproach
whatsoever: for (if we may believe Plato) what mass of gold soever, is either
over, or under the corth, deserves not to be compared with virtue, besides,
that saying of Solo^ ought still to be in our mouths.

We scorn to change
For store of worldly wealth,
Rich virtues meede,
Our souls eternal health.
Much less should we prefer the trencher-hired applause of spectators in a
Theater, or the honors and first places amongst the Eunuchs, Concubines, and
great men belonging to princes, before our virtue: for nothing deserves, either
admiration, or emulation, whose being is sharnefull; But that the lover is ever
blinded with affection toward his beloved, (as Plato tells us) and we do with
more ease perceive a shameful action, when it is committed by our enemies;
howsoever neither the joy which we have by their misdeeds, nor the grief which
we conceive of their good deeds, ought to be idle and unprofitable unto us, but
rather we ought so to frame the matter of both sides, that both in shunning
their vices, we wax more absolute, and in imitating their virtues, we become
more excellent then they themselves.
