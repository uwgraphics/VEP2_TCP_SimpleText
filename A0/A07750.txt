TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THE LORD MAYOR OF THE CITY OF LONDON, AND TO THE
RIGHT WORSHIPFVL ALDERMEN of the same, Thomas Morley Gent. of her Majesty's
Chapel, wishes long health and felicity.
I Am bold to present unto your good Lordship, with the right worshipful
Aldermen your assistants in the government of this noble City, some few
fruits of perfection of the most perfect men in their quality, that in the
censure of many which can well judge in Music, have been, and are at this
day held very rare and excellent, both for their skill and practice: whose
works that I might not abase in denoting them to a mean patron, nor abuse the
workers in joining them discordes for their true descant, I chose your
Lordships virtue with the rest, to grace their deserts with your gracious
favors: and not to disgrace my care and travail, which at the instant request
of my very good friend have been very careful truly to set them out. The
songs are not many, least too great plenty should breed a scarcenes of liking:
they be not all of one kind, because men's fancies seek after variety: they
be not curious, for that men may by diligence make use of them: and the
exquisite Musician may add in the handling of them to his greater
commendation. They be set for diverse Instruments: to the end that whose skill
or liking regards not the one, may attempt some other. This pain is past, in
hope to procure your Lordships pleasure and recreation: and your Honorable
acceptance shall be a sufficient warrant that my time is well spent: for I
desire not to satisfy bablers, which are baser then brute beasts in reproving
excellency, never attain to the first degree of any commendable Science or
mystery. But as the ancient custom is of this most honorable and renowned
City has been ever, to retain and maintane excellent and expert Musicians,
to adorn your Honors favors, Feasts and solemn meetings: to those your
Lordships Waits. after the commending these my labors to your Honorable
patronage: I recommend the same to your servants careful and skillful
handling: that the wants of exquisite harmony apparent being left vnsupplied,
for brevity of Proportions, may be excused by their melodious additions,
purposing hereafter to give them more testimony of my love toward them. Thus
as with my protested dutiful endeavor and obsequie I begun to your Honor and the
right worshipful Brethren: so with my humble petitions to the Almighty for
your prosperous preseruations, I end.

Your Honors in all duty and humility THOMAS MORLEY.
