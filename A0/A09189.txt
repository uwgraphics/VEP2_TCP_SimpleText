To all persons whom these presents may concern, of what estate and degree
soever.
NO man may arrogate to himself the name and title of a perfect and absolute
Surueior of Castles, Manners, Lands, and Tenements, unless he be able in true
form, measure, quantity, and proportion, to plat the same in their
particulars, ad infinitum, and thereupon to retriue, and beat out all decayed,
concealed, and hidden parcels thereof, fitting the same to their evidence, how
ancient soever; although blemished, obliterate, and very much worn: besides
the quickening and reviving of Rents, Customs, Liberties, Privileges, etc.
thereunto belonging: with perfect knowledge of customarie Tenures and Titles of
all sorts: framing Entries accordingly: together with good and commendable
penmanship, as well for the Plat, as Book, from the same. And for that more
abuse in concealments, encroachments, etc. has been offered in these last
100. years, than in 500. before, and that many do now refuse (as more
hereafter will) to pay their rents and duties, otherwise than on the meeres
head (their Lands and Tenements first singled out, and set forth unto them,
metis and bundis) I may not term him so much as a Surueyer, that performs
not these difficulties, and such like incident to Survey.

By Radulph Agas of Stoke next Nayland in Suffolck. Practiced in Survey more
than 40. years.
