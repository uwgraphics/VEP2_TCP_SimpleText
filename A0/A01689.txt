CERVA CHARISSIMA ET GRATISSIMVS HINNVLVS PRO



TO THE RIGHT Worthy, my much Honored friend, Sir Christopher Hatton, Knight
of the Honorable Order of the Bath.
SIR:
IT is proportion that beautifies every thing, this whole Universe consists of
it, and Music is measured by it, which I have endeavored to observe in the
composition of these few Airs, but cannot in their Dedication: for when I
compare your many favors with my demerits, your curious Ear with these harsh
Notes, there appears so plain a disproportion between them, that I am
afraid, least in offering to your Patronage Songs in some tune, my action
herein should be out of all tune; yet have I made bold to honor them with
your Name, that the world may take notice, rather of my want of ability, then
good will to be grateful. By which little outward demonstration, you may
easily guess at the greatness of my inward affection, as skillful
Geometricians do observe the true stature of the whole body by sight of the
foot only. Experience tells us that Songs of this Nature are usually esteemed
as they are well or ill performed, which excellent grace I am sure your
vnequalled love unto Music will not suffer them to want, that the Author
(whom you no less love) may be free from disgrace. They were most of them
composed in your own house, and do therefore properly belong unto you, as
Lord of the Soil; the language they speak you provided them, I only
furnished them with Tongues to utter the same: they are like young Scholars
newly entered, that at first sing very fearfully, it requires your Patience
therefore to bear with their imperfections: they were taught to sing only to
delight you, and if you shall take any pleasure in them, they have their end,
and I my wish, a full recompense for my passed labors, and a greater
encouragement to present you with some future things more worthy your
Patronage; till which opportunity, I rest

Yours ever to command Orlando Gibbons.

CERVA CHARISSIMA ET GRATISSIMVS HINNVLVS PRO



TO THE RIGHT Worthy, my much Honored friend, Sir Christopher Hatton, Knight
of the Honorable Order of the Bath.
SIR:
IT is proportion that beautifies every thing, this whole Universe consists of
it, and Music is measured by it, which I have endeavored to observe in the
composition of these few Airs, but cannot in their Dedication: for when I
compare your many favors with my demerits, your curious Ear with these harsh
Notes, there appears so plain a disproportion between them, that I am
afraid, least in offering to your Patronage Songs in some tune, my action
herein should be out of all tune; yet have I made bold to honor them with
your Name, that the world may take notice, rather of my want of ability, then
good will to be grateful. By which little outward demonstration, you may
easily guess at the greatness of my inward affection, as skillful
Geometricians do observe the true stature of the whole body by sight of the
foot only. Experience tells us that Songs of this Nature are usually esteemed
as they are well or ill performed, which excellent grace I am sure your
vnequalled love unto Music will not suffer them to want, that the Author
(whom you no less love) may be free from disgrace. They were most of them
composed in your own house, and do therefore properly belong unto you, as
Lord of the Soil; the language they speak you provided them, I only
furnished them with Tongues to utter the same: they are like young Scholars
newly entered, that at first sing very fearfully, it requires your Patience
therefore to bear with their imperfections: they were taught to sing only to
delight you, and if you shall take any pleasure in them, they have their end,
and I my wish, a full recompense for my passed labors, and a greater
encouragement to present you with some future things more worthy your
Patronage: till which opportunity, I rest

Yours ever to command Orlando Gibbons.

CERVA CHARISSIMA ET GRATISSIMVS HINNVLVS PRO



TO THE RIGHT Worthy, my much Honored friend, Sir Christopher Hatton, Knight
of the Honorable Order of the Bath.
SIR:
IT is proportion that beautifies every thing, this whole Universe consists of
it, and Music is measured by it, which I have endeavored to observe in the
composition of these few Airs, but cannot in their Dedication: for when I
compare your many favors with my demerits, your curious Ear with these harsh
Notes, there appears so plain a disproportion between them, that I am
afraid, least in offering to your Patronage Songs in some tune, my action
herein should be out of all tune; yet have I made bold to honor them with
your Name, that the world may take notice, rather of my want of ability, then
good will to be grateful. By which little outward demonstration, you may
easily guess at the greatness of my inward affection, as skillful
Geometricians do observe the true stature of the whole body by sight of the
foot only. Experience tells us that Songs of this Nature are usually esteemed
as they are well or ill performed, which excellent grace I am sure your
vnequalled love unto Music will not suffer them to want, that the Author
(whom you no less love) may be free from disgrace. They were most of them
composed in your own house, and do therefore properly belong unto you, as
Lord of the Soil; the language they speak you provided them, I only
furnished them with Tongues to utter the same: they are like young Scholars
newly entered, that at first sing very fearfully, it requires your Patience
therefore to bear with their imperfections: they were taught to sing only to
delight you, and if you shall take any pleasure in them, they have their end,
and I my wish, a full recompense for my passed labors, and a greater
encouragement to present you with some future things more worthy your
Patronage: till which opportunity, I rest

Yours ever to command Orlando Gibbons.
