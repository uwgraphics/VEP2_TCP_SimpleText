An Act for Reformation of the negligences of Constables, and of the Abuses and
misdemeanors of Apprentises, Carmen, and others, of and for the better
apprehension of the Offenders.
WHereas many times heretofore Complaints have been made by diverse the Nobles
and great Persons of the Realm, and others, that have occasion to pass the
streets, of many rude behauiours used toward them by Apprentises, Carmen, and
others: And now lately, an audacious and insolent affront has been offered to
the person of the Lord Ambassador to the King of Spain, and some of his
servants and followers to the great dishonor and scandal of the public
Government of the City, and at which the Kings most excellent Majesty (as he
has just cause) is highly offended: which disorders are conceived to arise and
grow, partly through the neglect of Constables, who are not ready to be found
when complaint is made: and partly through the default of the Inhabitants, who
are not ready to aid and assist the Constables and Officers in the
apprehension of Offenders: much less to apprehend the Offenders themselves,
and bring them to some Officer or minister of Justice; and partly for want of
good instruction and admonition given by Masters of Families, to their
Children, Servants, and Apprentises.

For remedy whereof, and for prevention of like abuses hereafter, Be it enacted
by the right Honorable the Lord Mayor of this City, the right Worshipful the
Aldermen his Brethren, and the Commons in this Common Council assembled, and
by Authority of the same, That every Constable within the City of London, and
the Liberties thereof, shall have his Constable-staffe (during all the time that
he shall be Constable) stand at his door, openly to be seen, to the end that
every man that has occasion to use the aid or assistance of a Constable, may
know where to find him. And also that every Constable, shall either by himself
(or if he have just occasion to be absent) by some fit and sufficient person
deputed by him be ready to perform the duty of his place, in apprehending of
Fellons, Vagrants, and other Offenders, and conueighing them to prisons fit for
them: And in repressing of Riots, rescues of Prisoners, or persons led to
punishment, and other disorders: and in the executing all other things
pertaining to the Office of a Constable, upon pain to forfeite twenty
shillings for every default, the same to be employed to the use of the poor of
the Parish, where the Offense is committed.

And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any just
Complaint be hereafter made of any violence or misdemeanor that shall be done
or offered to any Ambassador, Noble person, Ladies, Gentlewomen, or others,
passing through the streets. And that any Householder or Inhabitant shall be
required either by the Constable, his deputy, or the party grieved, to
apprehend such Offender or Offenders, and detain them until they may be
brought before a Justice of the peace, That then every person and persons so
required, shall accordingly aid and assist upon pain of such fine as to the
Court of Lord Mayor and Aldermen, upon examination of the nature of the offense
shall seem reasonable.

And for the better prevention of such disorders and abuses hereafter, and
that all Offenders in this kind hereafter may be without excuse, It is hereby
further enacted and enjoined, that all the Aldermen within their several Wards
respectively, or their deputies, shall forthwith give personal warning and
admonition to every Householder and Master of a Family, within the City and
Liberties thereof, that they themselves take knowledge, and do strictly charge
and admonish all and every their Children, Servants, and Apprentises, that both
they, their Children, Servants, and Apprentises, do from henceforth carry and
demean themselves well and orderly toward all Ambassadors, Noble persons,
Ladies, Gentlewomen, and others whatsoever, that shall have occasion to pass
through the streets, and do neither throw, nor shoot any thing at them, nor
mis-behaue themselves toward them, either in gesture, words, or action: nor
shall use upon the Exchange, nor in any street or lane of the City, any
uncivil sport, as Trap, Squibs, Foote-ball, or the like, upon pain of severe
punishment to be inflicted upon them, according to the quality of the offense.

And to repress the rude and unmannerly behavior of Carmen, Carters, Draymen
and others, using or working any Carre, Cart or Dray whatsoever, It is also
enacted and declared by the Authority aforesaid, that not only all and every
the Acts of Common Council and Orders of this City heretofore made for the
Government of them, be put in due execution, but also that the Master and
Wardens of the Woodmongers of this City, do admonish them particularly, not to
commit any such disorders hereafter that may give just cause of offense. And
that the said Master and Wardens do perform in all points, the Act of Common
Council made in that behalf in the time of the Mayoralty of Sir John Leman
knight, late Lord Mayor of this City, concerning Cars and Carmen. Assuring them
that a strict account shall be taken thereof, and severe punishments inflicted
upon any of them that shall offend in that behalf, according to the quality of
their offenses. And all Householders and Inhabitants are hereby likewise
enjoined to be ayding and assisting to the Constable or other Officer that
shall apprehend such Offenders, and themselves likewise in default of an
Officer to apprehend and deteine such an Offender, till he may be brought
before some Justice of the Peace, upon peine of such Fine as to the Court of
Lord Mayor and Aldermen, upon examination of the offense shall seem reasonable.

God save the King.
