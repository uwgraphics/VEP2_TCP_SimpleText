CERTAIN Articles, collected and taken (as it is thought) by the Bishops out
of a title book entitled an Admonition to the Parliament / with an Answer to
the same. Containing a confirmation of the said Book in short notes.

Esaias. 5.20. Woe be unto them that speak good of evil / and evil of good /
which put darkness for light / and light for darkness / that put bitter for
sweet / and sweet for sower.

The Prynter to the Reader.
This work is fynished thanks be to God /
And he only will keep us from the searchers rod.
And though master Day and Toy watch and ward /
We hope the living God is our sauegarde.
Let them seek / look / and we now what they can /
It is but inventions / and policies of man.
But you will marvel where it was fynished (ended /
And you shall know (perchance) when domes day is.


Imprinted we know where / and when /
Judge you the place and you can.
I.T.I.S

TO THE Prelacie.
IF men be dumb / sure stones shall speak /
God will his truth prevail /
Let men resist / it forces not /
It stands when they shall quail.
When it of men is most oppressed /
Then God does set in foot /
You Prelates know how true this is /
Think then what best may boot.
You that can council other men /
Your selves be councelled /
God will correct you know it well /
where it is well deserved.
Yield reason why (none good you have)
Gods church / Gods orders lack?
Not God the cause / he them requires /
Your Lordships keep them back.
Think on the time reformde to be /
Your selves which chiefly ought /
You may else kick / you wot who says /
Its hard auayling naught.
Repent / amend / show forth your love /
You which afflicte your own /
And we your best / whole Antichriste
May quite be overthrown.
By help of God / by help of Prince /
Whom God long save and bless /
With prosperous life / and earnest zeal /
At last heaven to possess.
A view of the Church / that the Authors of the late publyshed Admonition
would have plauted within this realm of England / containing such Positions
as they hold against the state of the said Church / as it is now.
A Reprouse of this view / made as it is thought / by the Bysheps / and a
Confirmation of the book in short notes.
WE are charged by the apostle to speak truth / every one to his neighbor /
which precepte I take to extend to the whole life of man / as well in matters
concerning the worship of God and his religion / an in them that cencerne the
common life (...) use of man. And to be faulty in it / as it is a thing worthy
reprehension in all men / so especially in the ministers of God / and such as
are / or ought to be by their calling / leaders and conductors of other. I
speak not this to carpe / or maliciously to bite any man / but to warn them
brotherly of their fault / that they may amend which have erred / and
committed a escape in this behalf. Some when they saw these Articles said in
this wylt: As they are in all their doings shifters / so have they in the
Collection of these Articles / showed them selves to be no less untrue dealers
/ then their causers vain and naught: both for vouching things out of the
Book / which are not in the book / and also in purtyng for the most true
propositions as paradoxes.

Fol. 3. li. 1. pa. 2. First they hold and affirm / that wein England / are
not yet come to the outward face of a church agreeable to Gods word.

In this first Allegation there lacks this word scarce / which is in both
copptes / first and last / wherein if they had meant plainly and truly to have
dealt with the world / they might have put it downs / as it is in ye book. Let
then think of them as they list / but to make a lie in ye beginning / is foul
and shameful.

2. lin. vlt. They will have the ministers to be called / allowed / and placed
by the people.

This Article is utterly falsthed. For it is in the Admonition / the election
was made by the Elders with the common consent of the whole church. And so if
they condemn the making of ministers / what do they else / but open their
mouth against God / and against the truth. Act. 14.23.

3 Fol. 4. li. 7. pa. 13. They will have none made minister / vnt ye minister of
some one certain parish.

A perilous crroure. Look Paul ad Tit. 1.5. I think we have no Apostles made
now a days / but pastors only: but if you think the contrary / I pray you
show me / whether such as you make / be bound in conscience to go unto Turcia
/ Barbaria and such like places or no: or why rather they should be bound to
England / more then to those places: and take hed^ here o^a Popes reason.

4 lin. 9. They hold that a bishop at no hand / has authority to ordain
ministers.

No / not alone / but as part of the consistory / and eldership and member of
the church / as Act. 1. And a bishop as ours are / that is Romish bishops /
creatures of the Canon law by no means.

5. lin. 17. They say for a bishop to say to the minister / Receive the holy
ghost / is blasphemous and ridiculous.

Is this put down as an error? in deed it is erroneous if the holy ghost
proceed from them: but ye let them consider of Caluu:. Io. 20.22.

6 lin. 28. They will have the ministers at their own pleasure to preach
without license.

This is also falsified / the book has it / if any be so well disposed to
preach in their own charges / they may not without my Lords license. A
shameful corruption. Any reasonable man would have known by the second Article
/ that no man can be a preacher at his own pleasure / but by the admission of
the congregation / but as before / so say we again. A Romish bishop has naught
to do / to give license / and his is as good to preach by / as the Popes calfe
was that Felton set up.

7 lin. 13. Fol. 17. li. 6. pa. 1. They will have the ministers discerned from
others by no kind of apparel / and the apparel appointed / they term
antichristian / and the apparel appointed by ye Prince / disobedyence against
the Prince.

This also is falsified / they speak of the simple kind of setting for the
the sacraments of Christ / and afterward in the purer churches / and compare
it with the pelf of beaurifying it (as they would have it seem) only found
out and appointed by popes from Paganes: The words are these / they ministered
the sacraments plainly / we pompously / with synging / piping / surplesse /
and coape wearing / so I find it in Fol. 4. pa. 2. lin. 15. Whether the
appared be Antichristian or no / it is no time here to debate / but let them
show from whence they had it? and le^ the^ not be ashamed to profess his name
/ whose cognizance they wear. Either let them speak as they are apparelled /
or let them apparel themselves as they speak. But I cry them mercy / they
do so now / and never so plainly / I am sure they have put forth here articles
/ which they shall never be able to show any ground for / unless they take it
from the Pope. And this I say to al good Christians / let them take heed that
they have not the supremacy of the Pope maintained here / whilst a few
white coats stand for hundred pounds / I say not thousands. For this view
which they put forth / drawing so many articles out of that small book /
absurd as they seem to put them forth / contains in it / so many false
articles clean against the truth and the book / as are by them put down.

8 Fo. 4. li. 1. pa. 2. They will have all Archbyshops / bishops / archdeacons
/ chaunceilors / and all other ecclesiastical officers together with their
titles / jurisdictions / courts / and lyuings clean taken away / and with
speed remoned.

Falsified in part. They have slily left out that / that they could nor / but
be ashamed of / if they had any shame / as Lords grace / Justice of ^eace and
Quorum / which have no ground nor warrant in Gods book. But I doubt not when
they come to (...) the book / or put ^owne the confirmation of their (...) to
continue these absura^^c^ we shall see good (...).

9 lin. 9. They will (...) have the ministers (...) (as they term i^) to any
iourn^^ of (...) ^^^ted by man / but as ^he spiri^e moves them / so to make
their prayers / and there^^ as they (...) be un^ ^o n^ pr^^^pt other of pray^^^
/ so ^^^l they have the book of (...).

Utterly (...). There is (...) / ^hut there s^^^ld be (...) / but that this of
th^^rs ought nor (...). A (...) of (...) ^hey deny not. Nay we do use (...)
^ure congrega^^^ / and the same that all re^^^^ed churches (...) but their
patched Por^^^^ is (...) to be all^wed / the causes ^an not be denied there are
^pan^ vil^ ^h^ngs.

10 Fo. 4. lin. (...). They (...) have (...)* sons / patronages / ^pan^ / and
orda^^ing o^ the ministers to be r^^^ned.

A fore matter and great error. It is to be thought that any reaso^^^^ m^n
would (...) for ^^ese / as though it were a^ absu^^^e to say they ought to be
taken away / why not a Card^^ll at ^^^er^^burye / as well as an ab^^^onage
(...) place. As for the bishops making of ministers / other wise then refore /
when they can (...) / we will yeede this is absurd.

11 Fol. ^. li. 15.16.21.17. They will have no hon^^^es red in the Church /
no^ articles / nor in^^et: o^^ set out nor used / ^or in no wise Sacraments
muustred in any house / nor in no wise the word red / but preached only.

A ha^ous error. ^te predicate. Math. 28. go and preach. Et quo^^^^que
con^^^^^s ali^^ alium expeca^te. 1. Cor. 11. So often as ye come together / tarry
one for another. Private houses are not m^^e for sacraments to be ministered in
/ when there is an open co^gre^^tion. They have no cause to think of our most
gracious Queen so wickedly / as yt they should be driven to maintain that
absurb and disorderous order. Thanks be to God / all church doors are open /
and god long preserve her majesty among us / by whose intants they are open.
Why should that be tolerated / which is a co^firming of their popish hoasling /
and the private midwiues baptising.

12 They will not have the Epistle and Gospel red / and whatsoever is said
before / they utterly mislike / and call it a Popes entrance.

Where else had yet it? and such patching was never taken but fro Rome / show
authority if they ca^.

13 pa. 2. li. 17.10. They cannot abide to have the Creed red at the Communion.

No / not as a piece of your mass / yet we use it in all our churches in every
sermon / it is not done for ye contempt of the Creed I would ye knew it.

14 Pa. 1. lin. 20. They will have the Communion received at the table sitting /
without further reverence / kneeling they say / is utterly unlawful.

Christ used it sytting / Antychrist kneling / whether is better to have Moises
or a Calfe?

15 lin. 14. They mislyke of these words / the body of our Lord Jesus
Christ. etc.

Why content you not your selves with Christ's words and the Apostles? Either
folysh Paul and wise you / or folysh you and wise the Apostles.

16 lin. 15. They mislyke of Gloria in excelsis.

Not every thing that is good / is to be patched into the Communion / because
that christians ought not to make quidlibet ex quolibet of a read a rams
horn.

17 lin. 12. They will have no other words / nor circumstance made / then
Christ used.

17 lin. 12. Falsified / the words are / we synfully mixed with man's
inventions. Speak truth if thou can / and shame the devil.

18 Fol. 6. pa. 1. lin. 12. They will have no Papiste / neither with his will /
nor constrained to receive the Communion.

Ah Paul what mentest thou. Probet seipsum homo. 1. Cor. 11. Let a man examine
himself. I tell you / the sacraments are too much abused by men wyllingly.
Add not more sins to cause the Lords wrath to be more hot against us.

19 line. 16. They will have no Godfathers nor Godmothers.

Utterly falsified.

20 Fol. 6. lin. 6. page 1. They will have all ministers equal.

Christ in deed erred in this / therefore we recant / inter vos autem non
sic. It shall not be so among you. Luke. 22.

21 lin. 10. They mislike all collectors for ye pore.

And would have Deacons placed / whose office it is. Act. 6. Romans 12.

22 Fol. 8. in fine. They say that there may be yet a more perfect form and
order of a church drawn / and that this is but an entrau^ce to a further
matter / promising that they will yet go further therein.

Falsified. Sed audin? verbum vnum cave de pleniore Christo / ne ad morbum hoc
etiam. Yet see how these men are troubled / even as legio was to hear of
Christ's coming. It greueth them to hear that Christ should be full amongst us
/ and not by patches and pieces.

Out of the second treatise called a view of popish abuses remaining.

Note three Articles omitted.

And why these more then the rest? if it be for yt you are ashamed of your
ungodly dealyng / with your fellow brethren / whom you and the rest of the
high Commissioners at Lambeth put from their livings and ministry for
refusyng to subscribe to your traditions it is well: if it be for that you see
them so suffyciently confuted / as you have nothing to reply / you are to be
borne wythall in hope of amendment.

1 Fol. 10. page 1. lin. 33. Reading of service or homelies in the Church they
say / is as evil as playing on a stage / and worse too.

Falsified / and yet mark I pray you their reason and comparison / not for the
thing it self / but for the persons them selves. For the players can say
their parts without book / these for the most part can but read theirs /
and that scarce too.

2 Fol. 12. pa. 2. lin. 10. Touching marriage / they A mislike the wedding ring
/ they are angrye with B taking of it up / and laying of it down. They will
not have she Trinity named therein. They say we make the man to make an idol
of his wife / because he says / with this ring I the wed / with my body I thee
worship.

A In deed they are pretty iugling castes / taken out of the Popes Mass book
/ as the most part of all their trashe. Rub. manu trahendo. Tit. Benedictio
sponsi and sponse.

B It is plain abusing of the name of God borrowed from thence too. You might
have foun^ better reason to have condemned this for a superstitious thing /
then a graye ammisse / for you have these wicked words put to it. Et proficiat
illi ad eternam salutem. And that it may profit him to eternal salvation. Ca.
Cretor. This were as good an occasion to cast it away / as Ezechias had to
break the serpent / and for your pretty using of it / let the Reader look upon
the Rub. Tune aspergatur.

3 lin. 3. Confirmation they misselike / and call it superstitious / popish /
and peeuishe.

Far over seen in so doing. It was a Sacrament / and may be still if it
please you. For you ^ertefie the child of Gods grace.

A 4 Fol. 13. pa. 1. lin. 1. Touching burial of the dead / they will have no
prescript service for it.

B They will any man indis^erently to burye the dead / and not to be tied to
the minister.

C They misselike of this prayer there used / that we with this our brother.
etc.

D They will have no sermons at burials / because they are put in the place of
Trentals / not so much E as lying of the corpse in the place of burial / the
fetching to the Church / the meeting of the minister. etc. they cavil at.

A What needs it? why should the priest say, meeting the corpse / even just
at the church style (for so the Rubricke says /) I am the resurrection and
the life. etc. to whom speaks he? to the living? why then at the Church
style / rather then in any other place? why at that time more then any other /
if it be for the living? If it be for the dead / O vile papists but thence it
came / look unto that stinking portuise. All that whole tracte was spoken / and
is spoken in most places in the person of the dead. See the blindness and
mischief of an adulterous nation. This for the church style. See those popish
apes. when he comes to the grave / what then? forsooth this must be said or
sung. Man that is borne of a woman. etc. O mourning joyful gospel spillers /
when we be at the graves side / we be in the midst of life / when w^ be put
in / we be in death. And I beseech you / when had you the prayer that
follows: where you show a patching of Antichrists inventions with the word^
of God. Beside the great and vile abusyng of the scripture / in using that for
a dead man / which bless^^ Job spoke in anguish of his heart / for the
affliction^ which he sustained / whilst he was alive. To b^ short / if thou
do it for a piece of Gods service / she^^ thy warrant / especially seeing
thou abusest ye scripture to thy purpose. It is never red or found eythe^ in
the old testament or the new / that God either appointed / or that there was
used any scruice for / (...) at / and in the burial of the dead.

B why? Because it is a piece of charity / which ^oncerneth every man / and
not any part of the mini^^erie / that it should be bound and appropriate to
them. Therefore we say / and that by the scripture / that it belongs to them
as to every pryuate man / and not otherwise. For who playde the priest / when
Abraham buried his wife / and Jacob his? what priest was it / that took Steuens
body / and Ananias and Saphira / and who preached at any of these burials?

C If you look well upon your old portuise / and confer it with yours now /
you can not well excuse it from being a prayer for the dead.

D we make not that a reason / but we show you how they came in / and how
they came to have that place. And if you be not minded to take away ye follye
and abuse / yet I pray you take order for your Ravens / that will take no
cracked French crowns for their Trentall sermons / seeing you will have it so.

E To take his leave of the belles with three peales / according to my Lord of
Canterburies last peruertisements.

5 Fol. 13. pa. 2. lin. 1. They find fault with saying the Psalm / I lifted
up mine eyes. etc.

Especially in summer for son burning / and if she come late at night / from
being a moon calfe / for she must be whoded. And I beseech you why should the
prayer ye is for the delivery of the church / or any member thereof from the
tirannie of the enemy of God / be used in a thanks giving of a woman after
childebirth. There is not one word in it for a thanks geuyng / but the whole
Psalm runs upon the miseryes that the poor captives are in / and yet they
entitle their service a thanks giving / and will needs have this Psalm used
to that purpose. Now tell me / if this be not abusyng of scripture.

6 lin. 4. They misselyke that we pray in the Letanie / that all men may be
saved.

Because we know that Caine / Judas / and all the inuenters of this gear /
the Popes are the children of perdition.

7 lin. 5. They misselyke that we pray to be delivered from thundrings and
lyghtnings / because when we so pray / there is often times no danger near.

Put in too / from sparrewe blastyng.

8 Fol. 13. pa. 2. lin. 7. They find fault with synging of Benedictus / Nunc
dimittis / Magnificat. etc. in the common prayer / calling it / the prophanyng
of the scryptures.

In deed we have a new Christ in some man's belly / and some John Baptist to
go before him / and Simeons good store / that will gladly dye so sone as he is
borne / but I think there be no pope Jones.

9 lin. 13. In all our order of service / they say / there is no edifying but
confusion / they say the interchaungeable saying of Psalms / is tossyng of
tennice balls.

Experience of these. 14. years / proves what edefying has come by it / and
the Psalms would not be handled in greasy alehouse chaunters mouths.

10 Fol. 14. pa. 11. lin. 18. The regiment of the Church / they call
Antichristian and deuelish / and say they may as safely subscribe to allow ye
dominion of the pope over us / as to subscribe to it.

No the Canon law is good scripture / and the pope Antichrist / a mete man to
set an order in Christ's house. And why not antichristian? they say truly /
and they have great reason so to say / for ye you have no scripture to prove
the contrary / for you stand only upon the laws of man / whom you have caused
for your behofe to confirm the laws of Antichrist therein. But is it therefore
not Antichristian / because that civil laws of earthly princes / have
confirmed ye canon law / and take it now as their own? As who shield say / the
translating of a law from one realm to an other / and from one prince to
another / lets or causes that the law may not / and is not rightly to be
said to be his / who first invented it? Because that princes have taken this
into their laws / that whosoever commits wilful murder / shall die the
death / is it ^^^fore Gods law? Because the laws of ye Greeks were translated
into the Roman Empire / therefore were they not the laws of the Grecians?
because ye a^^s of Justinian be come now to be practiced in France / Germany
and other places / therefore are they not Iustinia^s laws? But be it ye because
Papitius has gathered all the laws together / the whole be called Ius
Papirianum / yet are the laws theirs / and so shall be called whose they were /
if in this it be so / why should the Canon law lose his name / to be called
the Popes law? because that princes have confirmed it? As who should say / the
changing of ye name ^^tereth either the nature of the law / or else of other
thing whatsoever? It is not said or thought / ye because Adrianus or Bonif^cu^s
/ or whosoever was called Pope of Rome / therefore whatsoever law he ^^^^e was
naught / and to be rejected? but because he / (...) apope / yt is as antichrist
made it / having no ground in Gods word / but rather the contrary / therefore it
is said to be popish / and therefore deuelish / whole name ^o ever it put upon
it.

But there is a further matter in it. How may any ^^^ce give one man authority
to be bishop over a p^ouince or a diocese / more then the Emperor may give it
to any priest / to be over all Chriscendome / either by him self / or by the
content of other princes. For so some write that his supremacy came by the
donation of Constantine and see then how far this differs from Antichrist.
From Antichrist I say / in taking that / which they know / cannot be so given
/ and they condemn the taking of it in the bishop of Rome / for therefore they
call him Antichriste. They have said and we say / that iure diuino by the law
of God / he has no more authority and h^gher place / ^^en any other bishop /
and they say true. And because ^t takes it upon him iure humand / they call
him ^^tichriste. It can not be then / but that they she^ee ^^^selues herein to
follow the trace of Antichriste / ^^pecially seeing they have it uire humano /
and that ^ure pontificio.

11 page 2. clin. 14. They will have every minys^^ to have full jurisdiction in
his own parish.

It were a tyranny if he had it alone / I say in (...) parish / but forsooth
not so in a diocese.

12 lin. 28. They hold that the ministers at th^^ day enter not in by Christ
/ but by a popy she a^^ unlawful vocation.

Absurd / for Antichrist is Christ / and ye Canon la^ scripture. It will be
hard for you to show ye contrar^

13 lin. 28. They hold it is unlawful for one m^^ to preach in another man's
Church / or any m^^ to preach out of his own Church.

Tanquam ex officio / vt cordigeri and Iacobita^ It is true he ought not as of
his office and dueti^ as the Cordigers and Iacobites / and when it may showed
out of the scriptures / we will say as you sa^ 14 Fol. 18. pa. 1. lin. 13. They
will have all cath^drall churches pulde down wych Deaneries a^^ Prebendaries.
etc / clean taken away / and call t^^^ dens of leytering lubbers.

A dangerous matter if men stood under t^^ walls / and seeing the statute of
vagabondes why^^ is so straight. And I pray you what are they el^^^ but
loytering lubbers. Show what profit comes by them to the Church of Christ /
and how a^^ they occupied for the place of clearkes / which the wrongfully
keep.

The state of the church at this day / they call t^^ reign of Antichrist.

It is spoken of the Romish jurisdiction before mentioned. They have just
cause to say so / for wh^^ is it else? No ground can be given out of gods wo^^
for any of those positions which they put dow^ here / as reprehending and
reproving the book. (...) the adversaries of the book think to strive with
weapons of Antichriste against them / we ha^^ to behold the conflict with
patience / for we shall (...) their faule to their shame and smarte. If it were
(...) thing to be tolerated in the service of God / and th^^ ^^re is / in the
whole government of his house / to ^^rowe advise of the ennenyes of God / why
was (...) so precyse with his people of Israel by Moises ^^s servant / in
appoynting his service / and every ^^^e pertaining to the priesthode and
temple / that he ^ould not have the least rag that might be from ye ^aganes
his ennemies? was it not because he would ^^t have that to be any means or
occasyon of fami^^ritye with them / or any likeness / whereby they ^yght be
moved to follow them? Comunitie of ma^^^rs / and likeness of conversation in
matters of re^^yo^ especially / is a great cause of further acquain^^nce and
familiarity. Therefore that they should not ^^eme to allow / as from him and by
his means ^^eyr manner of doings / and that should not be done (...) him /
that was done to strange Gods / he inuen^^d and appointed an order aparte /
whereby he word (...) worshypped. The same trace did Christ follow. ^e neither
read nor find / that he borrowed ought (...) the Gentiles / and that more is /
because no doubt (...) would have us leave of all Iewishe ceremonies / (...)
commended not his own / and his fathers for^er laws / to his Apostles to be
observed. And ^^y then should we take ought from his enemy / ^^e child of
perdition and sin / the Antichriste of ^ome / who has been and is / the
greatest waster of ^^s church. Nay / they should rather take that way / ^herby
it might be hardly heard amongst our po^^erity / what manner of beast that
was. They should ^ake away both from the eyes and ears of all men (as well as
from their hearts) all signs and to^^ens / whereby that child of sin /
might come in^^ remembrance. O that we must still hold up the ^^ead of that
beast / which is worthily by Gods spi^^ie and judgment cast down into hell. O
that bre^^ren / our brethren I say / which have already been ^ersecuted / and
are like again to be persecuted (if God do not in mercy look upon his poor
afflycted Church) should stand is stoutly with their brethren / in whom they
can find no reproof / but the hatre^ of Antichriste / in this ouerflowing of
the blood o^ our brethren in France / which is yet green before our eyes /
and yet lies upon the face of the streate^ and fields of that curssed land /
should stand I sa^ so stoutly for that / wherefore all those their brethren
have been so cruelly and against all godliness an^ nature murdered and which
al their other brethr^^ else where / have justly condemned and cast away and
the godly here groan with the burden of it. Man it please thee O Lord / to open
their eyes / that th^^ seeking thy glory / may see to the safetye of this po^^
Church / yet standing as a little branch / but looking daily by thy just
judgment / for our not vprigh^ walkyng to be spoiled of those blood thirsty
and deceytfull men. Give them hearts O Lord / that the^ may forsee the day of
their destruction / nay our destruction / Good Lord pluck of the veil of
they understanding / that they be not taken in their syn and we with them be
cut of in thy displeasure Truth it is Lord / that we have well deserved the
contrary / and our sins we confess / have been som^^ occasyon of ye cuttyng
of of our brethren / yet for thy name sake be merciful unto us / that the
ennemy^ and blood thirsty man may not triumph and say / where is now their
God. Faults escaped.
