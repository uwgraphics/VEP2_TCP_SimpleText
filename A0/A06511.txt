When Paul bishop of rome the third of that name did proclaim and appoint a
general council to be holden at mantua in the year. 1537. at the fest of
pe^tecost which within a while after he would have had at some other place and
not at mantua / in so much that it was vncetten where he would or might best
appointe it / in the mean time we thought surely either to be called unto the
council to gether with other / or else to be condemned there uncalled / wherefore
this labor was required at that time of me that should gather our whole doctrine
in to certain specyal chapters and principal articles / that if the council
schuld goo forward in ernest / all men might have a sure knoulege wherein and
how far we would or colud give place to the papists / and again in what
sentence and mind we have determined fully with our selves to abide and remain
constantly for ever. And up on this request I did gather these pri^cipal
articles. set forth i^ this book / which I delivered to the whole number of
them that have received our doctrine. And they all with one consent did receive
and approve them / in so much as it was determined among them that if the pope
with his part should ones dare be so bold as to hold a right free / and lauful
council without any false fraud disceite or dissimulacyon / that than these
articles with the confession of our faith shuldbe offered up unto them. But the
court of rome abhors so sore from a fre council / and auoydeth from the
light so shamefully / that it has made eue^ them which stond on theer side /
utterly to despair of any general assemble / not only that this court of rome
will never call any free counsel / but also that it will never be content to
suffer gladly any counsel / to be had / with the which thing eue^ they the^
selves are offended and discontent / as they have a good cause / and are sore
grieved therewith / for as much as they perceive that the pope had rather all
christen men to perissh and go to the deuel / and that al theer sowles sschuld
perpetually be danned / than to suffer him self / his carnals / bisshopys and
shauelings to be reformed brought in to a right way or to oues cease his
tyranny. But I not with sto^ding thought it best to publyssh and set fort these
principal articles of our doctrine for this cause / that if it shu^ fortune
death to peruent me before any co^sel should be gathered as I both hope and
(...) / for as much as these wretches / abhor^ the perfect light like owels /
co^tendand (...) so besyly both night and day to hinder and prolo^g al mauer of
co^sellesyit the people myglit have deuer more in time to come my confession and
the testymony of my faith at hand to use read and look upon wherein as I have
continewed until this day so will I still remain so long as I live by the grace
of god. for what should I say / or how should I complaime? I am yet alive / I
write I teach / I read and preach daily / and yet there be certain venemos
serpents not only among our aduersarys but also among our false counterfeit
brethern which will seem to hold withus which do utter and betray them selves
studying maliciosly and falsely to wrest mine own writi^g mine own doctrine /
against my self / even before my face / I my self loking up on them and also
hearing them / and yet the themselves know welinough that I teach the
contrary. Thus like false thieves they abuse the labors and swet of my brows to
the maintenans of eher venom and poison. What will they do (think you) wha^ I
am dead? It is my part and duty therforto resist / withstand and confound them
whils I live. But how can I alone stop all the mothes of the deuel? of them
specially which (as they are all poisoned and infect) will neither hear nor
considre or mark such things as we write / but apply theer mi^des an study to
this thing only. most shamefully to wrest / corrupt mistake / and pervert our
words in every line The deuel of hell / or at the least the wrath of god
confute such wretches as they are worthy. I do often times remember the saing
of good gerso^ / which douteth whether any good book ought to be publisshed in
writing or no? If nothing should be writne tha^ are the souls of many one
neglect and not regarded which by such writings might have much help and
remedy. And again on contrary part when any thing is written / than the deuel
with an infinyte number of most spiteful and pestilent tunges is ready at hand /
to i^fect / poison and pervert all things that no man can receive and take any
profi thereof. And yet not witstonding all the world seyth what they win: for
after they began ones to forge lies up on us / and went about to withdraw men's
hearts from us and to wi^ne them to the^ selves with lyi^g / god has done and
wrought his work and will effectuosly. and has brought to pass that many do
daily swerve from the^ andi oncline to us and thus by their lies they have
procured the^ selves perpetual shame and dishonor / which thing god does yet
daily also. I must needs show and utter a certi^ story that comes now to my
mid There was at wittenberg a certain do^tor sent hither from france which said
openly before our faces the the king his master did surely bileue that there
was no manner of church or congregation with us / no manner of rulars nor
officers. And that there should be no manner of matrimony but that every man
should ru^ne at large now to one woman now to a another eue^ aftir the manner of
brute beasts / and agaime that it should be lauful for every private man to use
or misuse / do or undo all manner of thi^ghs after his own will and just etc. Now
tell me I pray you with what face shall these men dare look up on us at the
latter day before the judgment seat of christ which have tolder persuaded by
their letters and writi^gs / this Fig and other people and noble me^ such
mo^stros and abominable lies / for true tales? Christ all our lord / and the
most rightful judge, is our witness that they lie shamefully up on us and have
ever done: whose sentence and judgment co^demni^g them to everlasting
da^nacion they shall not chose but hear and abide. This am I sure of Now god
turn and convert the^ to repe^ta^ce which ca^ by any possible means be
converted / as for other everlasting and most cruel ponischment and da^nacio^
does remain for the^. But now to come to my putpose again / I would wissh
surely ones to see a true counsel whereby many co^trouersys might be taken a way
and many me^ might receive profi: not that we our selves have need o any such
counsel or plame^t for our churches are so lighned and confirmed i^ the pure
word / of god i^ the true use of sacraments / and in the knoulege of all good
order and all good works that for our cause we desire no manner of perlament or
council / for we cannot think that any council can teach us a more perfight
order than we have. But we see with deep sorrow and lamentacion of our hearts
mani parisshes miserably destitute / forsaken and unregarded both of bisshops
and of prebendarys: we see in theer diocyses and parisshes after what sort the
sely miserable people do live and dye for whose salvation Christ him self
suffered death up on the cross: and yet they ca^ not be suffered to hear nether
him their true shepard and pastor / nor yet none of his speaking and preaching
unto them for the which cause tremble and fear vehemently less god will
shortly call and bring all the world to a council by some angel / which shall
vtterley destroy us all / as he did ones Sodom and Gomor / for as much as we
contemn and mock him so lightly through our councels. And beside those things
which are necessary to be reformed in the spiritualty / (as they call it) there
be an infinite number of abuses in the temporal regiment to be redressed. for
there is uncharitable grudgd and dissensyon between princes and other nobles:
and usury and couetosnes have so far prevailed and has so drowned the
temporalty even like a flode or a see) that now in the place of the law are
crept in / riot / unmeasurable excess / wantones / pride in apparel / glotony
bankerting / dise / cards and pomp / withal kinds of vices and mischefe /
disobedience of subjects and housoldes toward theer heads / pestilent
enhansing of all manner of merchandise in biyng and seiling / these I say / with
an infinyte sort such life / have so prevailed that they can not be reformed in
X. councels nor in XX. assembles. These principal matters both of the
temporalty and of the spiritualty / if they should be entreated of in a general
counsel / they should make us to have so much labor and besines / that we should
sone forget and little regard the folissh triflyng about long gowns and broad
shauyn crowns / fryres girdels / bisshops forked cappes / carnal hattes / and
croser staves with such other trifyls. for it were time enough to entreat of
the choice of meats / the difference of garmeetes short or long of the shaui^g
of crounes and of cloisters / after that the pri^cipal articles of the faith
with a godly politic order for the comonwelth were determined and concluded by
the word of god. But if we will swalow op Vhole camels / and strain gnaties /
if we will receive and suffer great beams in our eyes and pluck out the small
motys / if we will stomble at a strane and leap at a block / we need not be so
greatly cariful for any councels. wherefore I have made but a very few chapters
and principal articles for else we have so many co^mandme^ts given us of god to
be observed in his church / in the comynalty / and in every particular house
and parissh / that we are never able to perform them. wherefore what need is it
to make many acts decreys and tradicions beside? specially if the principal
articles and co^mandments enioined us by god himself be neglect and nothing
regarded / as though god must give place to our folissh trifles because we
tread his special co^mandmenas / under our fete like swyne. But our sins do
so sore vex oppress and lade us that they will not suffer god to have mercy
upon ue / because we do not repent nor amend / but rather study and labor to
stablissh and mainteyne all manner of wickedness. O merciful lord Jesus christ /
were save then thy self to celebrate a council and to redeem thy elect through
thy own glorios presens for of the pope and of his adherents there is no hope at
all. they will in no wise receive the. wherefore help thou us pore miserable
creatures / crieng and calling unto the / seking the ernestly / for the
abowndant mercys safe that thou have given through thy holy spirit which lives
and reigns with the and with the father to be praised and glorified for ever
and ever. Amen.

The first part contains the special articles of the divine majesty of god.
I. We confess first that the father / son / and the holy ghost in one divine
substance and nature be^ distinct persons and yet one god which created heaven
and earth.

II. That the father was without begimming ano the son had his begimming of the
father / and that the holy ghost did proceed of them both

III. That the father nor the holy ghost did never take op on them mannys nature
/ but theson only.

IIII. That the son was so incarnate that he was conceived by (...) the holy
ghost without any ma^s help / and born of the pure and holy virgyng Mary. and
after ward that te suffered his passion / dyed and was buried / destended to ^e
hellys. Rose fro death / asceded heaven sits at the right hand of the father
/ and that he shall come to judge the quict and the dead etc. as the common creed
of the apostles / the creed song in the mass / and the creed of athanasius do
teach.

Of these articles there is no controversy contencyon for both parts do
confess all these things / wherefore it were but folly to entreat more largely
of them

The second part contains the articles of the office and work of Jesus Christ
and of our rede^pcyon / and of all his bemifights and acts which he has done
for us
In this article this is the first and principal some that Jesus Christ our god
and lord suffered death for our sinnys and rose again to save us / Roma. 4.
Item that he is the only special lamb of god / which takes a way the sins of
the world. Ioha^ the i. And that god has laid the iniquyte of al man kind upon
his back / Esai. 53. furthermore all people have sinned and they are made
rightuos again / or saved / freely by the mere grace and mercy of god through the
redempcyon of Jesus Christ and through his blood Roma. 3. And for as much as
this grace and mercy must be received by faith (for no man can obtain it by
any worck not yet by the law nor by any merit) therefore it is certain and
manifest that we be justified by faith as holy paul testifies the 3. to the
roma. sayng we suppose man to be justified by faith without the works of the
law. Item that he migh be just and the iustifyer of him which bileueth in
Jesus. etc.

From this article can we not move one hearbreade / though se haven and earth
should fall and all the world goo to gether to wrack / for there is no another
name under heanen where by we can be saved / Actu. 4. Item / Esaias. 59. we are
healed through his stripes.

This article is the whole foundation and ground both of all that we teach and
also live against the pope / the deuel and the world. wherefore we ought in no
wise to dowte of this article.

Else all together were done / and at a point / and the pope / the deuel with
his whole rabble should have the victory of us and triumph cover us.

The second article.
The mass that is commonly used in the papistry is the highest and most
horrible abhominacion that ever was / and it is as contrary to the principal
article of the faith as heaven is to hell although among all the popisch
Idolaters it is the most precios / dai^^ and brings most lucre to the purse.
for all men have bileued surely that the sacrifice and work of the mass though
it were done of the most rascal scull you in the world / yet it should deliver
me^ from all their sins both i^ this life and also after this life i^
purgatory / which thing can no thing do not perform save the only lamb of god
as is before said. Whe^for we will give no place in this article / nor grant any
part thereof. And if any man chance upon some reasonable papist / let him axe
him gentylly / for what cause they labor to maintain the mass so obstinatly /
specially seeing it^ is nothing else than a man's inuencyon and no ordinance of
god. And it is lauful to neglect and break man's tradicyons / as christ says-
Math. 15. they honor and serve me in vain teaching the doctrines / tradicions
and commandme^tes of men. And again it is a thing of no necessite and it may be
left welmough with out any sin or perel.

Thirdly. The sacrament may be received after a better mor profitable and a
more holsom way / acording to the institucion of christ: which way is only
profitable and none but it. whe^fore why should we bring the world in to so heavy
a misery and danger for a fansy of man's brain / and a trifel of naught Let the
people be taught in common sermons / that the mass being an imaginacyon of man's
brain may be taken a way and disamulled with out any sin / and that it is a
matter of no da^nacyon to despise the mass / for a man may obtain everlasting
saluacyo^ with out the mass / and after a better way than by it. Now if the
people were thus taght / there were no dowte but that it should come in to
contempt alone of it self without any labor / not only among the simple people /
but also among all good / wise and vertuos men.

And this thing might be brought to pass the better / if they were instruct /
that the mass is a perlos and a dangeros thing / imagyned of man's brayn with
out any commandment or will of god.

Forthly for as much as there have been an infinyte number of most detestable
abusis through out the whole world by the reason of bying and selling of masses
/ it is a lauful and a sufficient cause wherefore all masses ought to be
disanulled and forbidden / though it were for no another cause than this only
that those abuses might so be removed / although there were some goodness or
vtilyte in them as there is none at all. And they ought rather to be abolisshed
that these abuses might be forbidden / specially seeing such masses be
unprofitable / unnecessary / and full of perel and danger / and agaime all
things both more necessary more profitable and also more certain / may be
obtained / though there were n^ such mass.

Fifly / the mass neither is nor ca^ be / nothing else than a worck of men (as
the old canon and all old boke^ do also testifye) yea and invented by most
wicked rascals / for this purpose that every man might reco^cile both hi^ self
and other unto god and both obtain and merit remissi- of his sins and the
favor of god through he ari^g / sai^g or causing it to be said. for wha^ it is
done / said or hard even most holyly / it is done said and hard for no other
end than a fore rehearsed. for unto what other use or vtilite can it serve?
wherefore it must needs be condemned and taken a way / for it is against tpe
principal article of our redemption / which says that no manner of pressed or
shaueling noither good nor bad / nor no manner of work or sacrifice / can take
away our sins / save only the lamb of God / the so^ of God. further more if
any prist will use this excuse / cloak and prete^se to say that he ministers
the sacrament to him self alone / for this purpose that he may the more
perfightly with better diligence and reverence receive it / let hi^ know that
this is no ernest but a prete^sed excuse for who so ever will use this supper
perfightly and reverently to confirm his faith and to have any profight thereby
/ must receive it in the true sacrament ministered / acording to the institucyon
of Christ. But for a prist to minister the sacrament to him self alone / it is
but a face and an imaginacion of man^ brain / both uncertain / dangeros /
unprofitable and also forbidden. And who so ever does so / he does he cannot
tell what / for he co^te^neth the word of god and follows a false face /
opinyon and imaginacio^ of man's brain. And (although all other things in it
were never so probable) yet it is unlawful for any man to use the como^n
sacrament of the whole church / privately to his own use alone / after his own
folissh imaginacyon and false persuasyon contrary to the word / of god /
privately and not to gether with the common whole congregation: and so they
handle the sacrament of christ as a thing of light reputacyon. for this
sacrament was not institute to be used of one alone but it was given to the
whole multitude to be used como^ly of many to gether.

I am sure that this article of the mass / shall be one of the special articles
which shall be called into controversy / when so ever there be any general
counsel. for if it were possible / they would rather grant us all other articles
than this one. And carnal campegius at the council holden at Augspurg / did
openly say that he would rather suffer him self to be racked and every member of
his body to be teared from other than that the mass should perisshe or be
condemned. And I for my part / by the grace of god / will suffer my self to be
consumed into ashes / before I will permit any popissh prist or patched
shaueling to be either equal or superior to christ my Lord and my Savior.
Wherefore we are and remain for ever emnys and contrary one to a another. They
perceive right well / that if the mass were condemned / than the whole papistry
were clean over thrown: and therefore they would rather se us all poisoned and
burnt (if they could) than to grant us this one article. Beside all this / this
Dragons and deuels tail the Mass, has been the cause and the very mother of
much blasphemy / and of purgatory. where / through soul masses for the dead /
through dirges and co^mendacions / through month minds / trentals / year days
/ and bowel masses and chantry masses to be said in their cowrse (and specially
on sowlemasse day /) they have been wholly altogether occupied in purgatory and
with nothing else tha^ with purgatory / inso much that the mass has been used
and usurped in a manner for the dead only / where as christ did institute his
sa^rament for the living alone.

Wherefore Purgatory with all his pomp / high honor and merchandise must be
taken for a mock and a mist of the deuel. For it is contrary to the principal
article of our redempcyon which teaches that al sowles be redeemed and
delivered through no works of man / but only therow christ alone. Furthermore
we have no commandment of god concerning dead sowles / and therefore this
purgatory / although it were no error or Idolatry / might laufully be condemned.

The papistrs are wont to allege.S. Austen. for this article and they cite the
testimonys of diverse doctors which have written (as they say) of purgatory.

They think that we understand not / for what purpose they speak such
sentencys. S. Austen writes not that there is a purgatory / neither has he
any place of scripture whereby he can prove it: but he leaves it in dowt
whether there be a purgatory or no / and he says that his mother required to
have a memory at the altar or the receiui^g of the sacrament which thing
whatsoever be / it is nothing else than a supersticyos imaginacyon of a few men
/ which can make no article of our faith / for that is the office of god alone.
But the papists do so wrest and writhe such testimonys of men / that the people
should believe more faithfully / their filthy / wicked and abominable macha^dise
of sellyng and offering masses into purgatory for dead sowles etc. Which they
shall never prove by S. Austen. When they have ones condemued those putgatory
merchandise of masses (werof S. Austen did never in his life ones dream) than
will we dispute with them whether.S. Austen without any auctorite of scripture /
ought to be received and allowed or no / and whether it be lauful to have
memorys of dead sowles when the sacrament is received or no for we may not take
all the doings and saings of holy fathers for articles of our faith. For by
that means / their manner and order of living / their clothes or garments and
their howses also wherein they did dwell ought to be esteemed as articles of the
faith / like as the relykes of saints have heretofore been esteemed. But the
word of god only must make articles of the faith / and no creature beside / no
though it were an angel of heaven.

Secondarly / up on the mass have risen many iugglinck sotiltes of false
sp^rytes which have appe^ryd under likeness of men's souls / desyryng to have
masses / dirgys / pilgrymages and such kind of almassys to be done for them /
with such lies and disceitesul mockes as no man can rehearse / which all the
world must be compelled to esteem as articles of the says / and to live after
their appointment.

And the pope has confirmed also / all such things / as he has done the mass
and all other abhomynacyon.

Thirdly. The mass was the cause of pilgrimages / for in pilgrimages / the
people have sought masses / remission of sins and the mercy or favor of god.
And the mass has been the head captayn of all these tgings. And it is wonder
that such things should be imagyned / seeing it is so manifest that there is no
manner of mencyon of pilgrimages in the word of god / and again it is evident
enough that they be unprofitable for as much as we have many better things than
pilgrimages / and finally they may be left and forsaken with out all sin /
perel or danger. Why do men run from their own cytes and parisshes / forsake
the word of god / their wives and childern (which all be necessary things and
commanded us by god to stike unto) and in stead of them follow and delit their
selves in unprofitable / folissh / daugeros things and deulissh errors / but
that the deuel has procured and sturred up the pope to command and confirm
such things / whereby many people might be seduced from christ and fix their
hope and trust in their works? and also (which is worst of all) to commit
daily Idolatry. furthermore / I say / it is no necessary thing / having no
commandment of god nor no word in the scripture which councelleth men thereunto
/ and it is also a doutful dangeros and a noysom thing. Werfor in this article
we ought to grant nothing nor to give no place at all / unto our aduersarys.
Let the common people be taught that pilgrimages be not necessary / but full of
perel and danger / and than after ward / let us see where any pilgrimage shall
remain or where a man shall find any.

Fortly / brotherhodes / felowships and gyldes wherein abbeys colleges and whole
dioces / parsons and vicars have bound them selves one to a another by letters
patentes / and every one made other bretherr partakers of all their masses and
good works etc. as well for the dead as for the living / (which is a filthy and
an abominable merchandise) And it is not only an inuencyon of man's brain not
contained in the express commandment of god / and unnecessary / but it is also
contrary to the first article of our redempcyon wherefore it is in no wise to be
permitted or suffered.

Fifthly. The relics of saints (in the which point so many manifest lies and
folissh trifles have been tried of dogs and horse bones / that eue^ for such
falshode whereby the deuel has blered the world / they ought to have been
condemned long agoo / although there had been some goodness in them) what be
they? are they not unnecessary and very unprofitable things / which the word of
god never cownceled any man to use? But yet this is the worst point in them /
that men have imagyned that they should obtain pardon and remissyon of sinnys
rhorow such relics (life as they have imagyned of the mass) as though it
were a good or an high honor and service of god.

Sextly. Masses have been the occasion of pardons also: which have been granted
both to the living and in the dead (but not for naught with our money) in the
which pardons that false traiteros Judas or pope has sold the merits of
christ / with the vain or superfluos merits of all saints / and of the whole
universal church. wherefore they ought in any wise to be condemned. for they
lack not only the word of god to approve them / (having no commandment to be
used / and being things of no necessite) but they are also cleame contrary to
the first article of the faith. for we obtain the merit of christ / not by
our own works or with any money / but by faith through the fre grace and mercy
of god with out any money or any merits of our own / which merit of christ is
offered unto us / not by the auctorite or pour of the pope / but in the gospel
and word of god.

Of the inuocacyon of saints.
The inuocacyon of saints is also an abuse of Antichrist which repugneth with
the former principal article of our redempcyon and it obschureth or drowneth
the knoulege of christ.

And there is no commandment / council or example thereof in the holy scripture
/ and agaiine although the praing unto saints were never so good (as it is a
very deuelissh abuse) yet we may receive all things much better and also more
excellent / of christ than of any saint. And not with standing that the angels
do pray for us in heaven (as christ himself also does) and the saints hereupon
earth / and parauenture they that be in heaven also / yet it follows not
thereupon that we ought to invoke / honor or pray unto angels and saints or
to fast / keep holy day / sing or hear masses and to sacrifice or make any
oblacyo^ in the worship of any saint or angel / nor yet to byld any temples or
altars or to make any service for them or to worship and serve them many diverse
ways / to take them for patrones or defenders to seek help for all manner of
things of them and to believe that eueryone of them has a peculyar proper virtue
by him self / some for one thing and some for a another as the papists both
teach and do. For it is very mere Idolatry so to do for as much as all such
honor is peculiarly due to god only and to no other. Thou may / I will not say
contrary / as a christen man and as a saint pray for me / up on earth while thou
lyuest / not for one thing / but for all manner of things: notwithstonding I
must not by and by / honor the and call up on theas a god / nor yet set up a
fasting day and an holy day in thy honor / or to ordeyne masses to be hard and
said or any other oblacyons to be done in thy honor / and so to put and fix
all the hope of my salvation in the there be other ways where by I may have
the in reverence / love the / rejoice in the / and give the thanks in christ.
Now if these Idolatrissh service and honoriug of angels and dead saints were
drowned and brought out of memory / all other honor about them could not greatly
hurt / but should daily decay. for first if all hope of lucre and profit were
taken a way / and again if that the people were persuaded that they could
obtain no manner of help or profit neither corporal nor spiritual / bodyly nor
gostly by their honoring or inuocating of saints / there would be but few that
would worship any saints whether they were in their graves or in heanen. For no
man would greatly remember them / no man would serve or honor them for nawght of
love only. This is the sum and effect of all together. What so ever is in the
mass / what so ever is sprung up thereof / and again what so ever is annexed
unto it we can in no wise suffer but we must needs condemn them to the deuel /
that we may have / use and retain the pure and certain holy sacrament acordi^g
to the institucyon of christ with true faith.

The third article.
The colleges of prebendarys and the manasterys were at the first ordained for
a good purpose that learned me^ and vertuos weme^ might be brought up in them.
wherefore they ought to be reformed / that they were first ordained / that the
church may never be destitute of learned curates / preachers and other ministers
which may be called out of such colleges into the common wealth to be officers in
cytes and cownteys Like wise of virginis well brought up which may after ward be
vertuos matrones and good house wives. And if monasterys and colleges will not
consent nor apply themselves to serve unto these and such like uses / it were
better that they were utterly destroyed / supressed and ouerthrown than that
they should be reputed more holy (than the common sort of christian men and than
other oyders / states and conditions of life institute of god him self) only
for their wicked supersticyons ceremonys and service invented by man for all
these opinyons do repugne with the first principal article of our redempcyon
through Ihesus christ.

Beside this they have no commandment of god neither / no more thn all other
tradicyons and fansys of men: they be not necessary neither nor profitable
being used as they be / for they cause many dangeros and perlos trobles and
vexacyons. for the prophets them selves do maue all such service and ceremonys
invented by men.

Auen that is to say comberos things.

The iiij Article.
The pope neither is nor can be by the law and commandment of god the head of
the whole church / for that is christ alone and nome but he: And the pope is
nothin else but the bishop / curate or parissh prist of Rome and of them that
of their own will or by the ordinance of man / that is to say by the temporal
rular are appointed to be under his cure / not to be subject to him as to their
highest lord and prince / but that they should like christen men live together
with him like brethern and felows of the same degree / like as the old councels
and the time of cypriane do euydently declare.

But now there is no bishop in the world that dare call the pope / brother /
as they did commonly in those days

But even emperors and kings are feign to call the Pope their lord. which
thing we neither will nor ought nor yet can we with a safe conscience condestend
or grant unto it. Who so erer please to do it / he shall do it alone for us.
Here up on it follows that all such things as the pope has done / made / or
ordained / through his false / vain / wicked and usurped tyrannical pour / have
been and be yet the arts and ordinances of the very deuel / and purposly
devised to the destructyon of the holy universal Christen church (so match as
lay in him) and to the overthrowing of the first principal article of the
redempcyon of Jesus christ those ordinancys only except which concern the
polytick state of the temporal common wealth / wherein god gives also many good
and holsom things to the people diverse times through tyrannys and godles wretchys

There be papers and bulls of the pope wherein he roryth like a lion (as the
angel painteth him properly in the 12. chap. of the Apocalip.) sayng that no
christen man can be saved except he serve him and be obedient to all things
which he co^mandethe / says / and does Al things are as much to say as thus /
although thou byleuyst in christ and have obtained of him all manner of things /
yet all is to no purpose nor effect except thou will honor me for thy god / be
subject to me and obey me etc. And yet it is manifest that the holy church had
no such pope or bishop within thest viij. hundredth years. And even at this
day the grecyans and other nacyons be not subject to no such bishop or syran
nor never were. Wherefore as we have of ^t said it is but a folissh imagyn^cyon
of man's brain / whereof there is no commandment nor mencyon in the holy
scripture / and it is both an unnecessary and also a superfluos thing / for the
holy christen church can stand with ourt any such head: and it had been happy
for the church of god if the deuel had never exalteed nor set up such and head.
Further more the whole papistry / the pope with his whole rabble of carnals /
bisshapys / canons and such other / be unprofitable and superfluos me^bres in
the church for they do no office pertening to a christian man Thus the church
may well consist and remain though the pope were condemnyd to the deuel.

Imagyne that the pope would grant himself that he were not the supreme head of
the church by any law or commandment of god / but only because there ought to
be one head in the church where unto all other might lean and depend that a
concord and unity might the better be kept among christen men against all
sects and heresys. Such an head ought to be chosen by the consent of all men
and it ought to be in the lyberty and power of men sentyme to change some time
to depose such heads like as the council of constance did with certain Popes:
which cowncel did depose iiij. popes one after a another and did chose the
forth. But Imagyne (I say) that the pope and the court of rome would grant thus
much (as the will never do / for than should he be compelled to suffer his whole
kingdom and order to be ouerthrown and destroyed with all his canon law and
all the books thereof / and again he cannot grant it for it is contrary to his
oath yet / I say / though he would grant it / it were nothing profitable to the
church to have any such head and there should rise by that means many moo
sects than were before / for seeing no man were bownd to owe any obedience to
such an head by the law and commandment of god but only every man to submyt
him self under his subiecyon of his own fre will / he should easily and sone come
in to contemp and be robbed or spoiled of all his membros. finally such an head
ought not to be at Rome or in any private place but in all places and in every
church / where so ever god had given any such and office.

But oh lord what a great confusyon and business would this thing engender?
wherefore the church can never be better ruled and perserued than if all men
should live together under oue head christ / and that all bisshops (so much as
perteyneth to the office of a bisshops should be of like pour and auctorite
(alshough they were not like in gifts. and knoulege) and so consent with all
dilygence in vniforwe doctrine / faith / sacraments / prayer / and other
works of love and charity. Thus writes.S. Ierom that the pristes and bisshops
of the church of Alexandria ded rule the church commonly to gether one with a
another / like as the apostels did / and all bisshops after ward did like wise
in the universal primatyue church until such time as the pope began to lift up
his head above them all. This part proves euydently the pope to be antichrist
/ which had extolled him self above christ and bent himself against christ.

He will grant no man to be saved without his auctorite and pour / which pour
not withstonding is nothing at all: neither ordained nor commanded by god. What
is this else than to exalt him self above god and to bent him self as adversary
against god as.S. Paul says?

The very Turck and hell it self / though they be never so great enmys of
christendom / did never any such thing

They permit and suffer all men to believe in christ who so will / only they take
tributes of christen men and they require all outward obedience.

But the pope forbids us to believe in christ sayng that we must obey him /
and so we shall obtain salvation of our souls.

But we will not obey him to dye there for / we will rather submyt our selves to
death in the name of god.

All this besinesse is risen hereupon that the pope will have himself named the
head of the universal CHRISTEN church by the law of god whereupon it must needs
follow that he co^pareth yea and prefers him self unto christ: first he
called him self head of the church: after that / lord of the church / thirdly
supreme lord of the universal world / and finally the god of the earth / in as
much as at length he went about to command the angels of heaven.

And if the doctrine of the pope be tried by the the scrspture and were compared
therewith / we shall prove and find that his doctrine even whereas it if best /
was taken out of the cyuil and heathnissh law / and that it gives laws and
perceptes of ciuyl matters and of cyuyl judgments as his own decretals do
testifye. After ward his doctrine teaches certain ceremomonys of temples / of
garments / of choice of meats / of difference between pristes and lay men and
of such folissh things / iugglyng soteltys and fantastical trifles an infinyte
number. And in all these things there is no word nor mencyon of christ / of
faith^ or of the co^mandments of god. Insumma^ there is nothing in his doctrine
but deuelisshnes / and his lies of masses / purgatory / monasterys / works and
ceremonys (all which be the very papistry) he co^tendeth to set above christ
and god and against god / condemnyng / kyllyng / and persecuting al christen
me^ which will not extol and honor this his abhomynable wickedness above all
things in heaven and earth. for the which canse life as we can not find in our
hearts to bow to the deuel and to honor him for our lord and god: Even so life
wise can we not suffer his Apostle the Pope / or Antichrist the supreme head
and lord in his kingdom. For to lie to murder / and te destroy the soul with
the body be the very natural propertys of the popys kingdom.

Now the council shall find and have enough in these iiij. articles / to
condemn. for they neither can nor will grant us the least part or point of
them. Of this thing we ought to dowt nothing at all / yea we must rather
comfort our hearts with this hope and trust that Ihesus christ will fight
against his emnys and persecute them both with his spirit and also with his
coming which thing god grant / Amen.

As for us let us not look that we shall not be suffered to stand before the
emperor or any ciuyl judge and rueler / as we did at augspurg where the emperor
did hear our cause and matter favorably / But we must stand before the pope
and the deuel him self which will not hear any thing at all / But with out any
cause will judge us condemn us to death / and compel us to Idolatry whether we
will or no / wherefore we will never in our life kiss his fete nor say you arre my
good and gracios lord / but we will say (as the Angel sait to the deuel in
Zachary) god pomissh the Satan / thou adversary of god.

The third part of the articles.
Of the articles that follow it were better for us to entreat of them with
learned and wise reasonable men / or among our selves than with the pope which
with his whole sect and faccyon with him but riches / honor / po^pe power are
only in reputacyon with him.

Of sin.
In this article we are compelled to grant with S. Paul the v. to the romans /
that sin entered in to the world by one man Adam / through whose disobedience
all men are made sinners and subject to death and to the deuel. Now the
operacyons of this sin / are euel works such as be forbidden in the.x.
commandme^tes / as be these distrust in god / false faith / Idolatry / to be
with out all fear of god / presumpcyon / desperacyon / blyndnes of heart / and
to conclude in a sum / the ignorance and contempt of god. After these / to
lie / to swear by the name of not to pray / not to call up on god / to despise
or neglect the word of god / to be disobedient to parents. Item murder /
flesshly lust / theft and falshode. This original sin is so great a corrupcyon
of nature / that no manner of reason can see and perceive it / and therefore it
must be byleued by the reuelacyon of the holy scripture / Psalm. 51. Roma. v.
Exodi. xxxiij. Gene. iiij.

Wherefore it is a manifest error and a blyndnes repugnyng with this article / to
say as the schole dyuynes or du^sys have taught first that after the fall of
Adam all the natural strengh of man does remain perfight and vncorrupt.

And that man has naturally a right reason and free will / that he may satisfye
and fulfill the law of god.

Secondorly That man has free will so that he may do all good and eschew all
euel. and again on the contrary part / leave that which is good and follow the
euel.

Thirdly That a man by the proper strength of his own nature may satisfye and
fulfill the whole law of god.

Fortly That a man of his own natural strenth can love god above all thing /
and his neihbor as him self.

Fifthly That if a man do and perform so much as he is able to do / than shall
he surely obtain gods favor.

Sextly. That it is not necessary for him that will receive the sacrament / to
have a purpose to live well afterward.

But that it is ^ufficient if he have not an obstynate and wicked purprse to
sin: so good is our nature of it self / and so such efficacyte is the virtue
of the sa^rament.

Seuently. That it is not taught in the scripture that it is necessary for him
that will do any good work / to have the holy ghost with his grace.

These and such like errors have sprung up of blindness and ignorance / because
they were ignorant both of sin / and also of christ our sauyor: and they be
very heathnissh opinyo^s which we can not suffer nor abide. for if they were
tue tha^ did christ dye in vain / for as much as there is no corrupcyon nor
sin in man (after their opinion) for the which christ nedyd to have dyed. Or
else he must have dyed for the body only and not for the soul / for the soul
is vncorrupt and the body only subject to death after this opinion.

Of the law.
In this article our judgment is that the law was given by god to bridle and
refrain us from sinnyng partly with threatni^gs and with fear of ponisshment
/ partly with promises of grace / favor and other benifites: But all these do
help but little by reason of the corrupcyon and wickedness which sin does
engender in man for hereby some which are emnys of the law are made worse: for
as much as they desire more fervently to do such things as they are forbidden
to do by the law / and they do not gladly such things as they are commanded to
do.

And thus in as much as they are feared by pomisshment / they offend now still
more against the law than they ded before. Now such are unrecoverable and
damnable, persons past all amendment for they commit sin and wickedness as often
as any occasyon of sinning is nffred.

There be other some / which are blind / and boast and extolle the^ selves /
supposing that they can save them selves through their own pour and stre^ght /
thinking them selves able to keep And perform the law as is before said of
the schole dyuynes or Sunses. And by such means / become they hypocrites and
only colored saints / holy outwardly only.

But the chief office and effect of the law is this / to show and declare
original sin: and to teach man how sore his nature is infect or poisoned /
And that it is altogether corrupt / unto whom the law says that he honoreth
not god but contemns him and honoreth strange false gods which thing before
the law taught him it / he did in no wise bileue it to be true. Now man being
put in fear humbles him self / abiecteth and abateth his heart and utterly
despaireth / and desiereth fervently to have some help and being dismazed that
he can not tell whether to turn him / he begins to be a^gry with god and to
murmur against him: And this it is that is spoken in the iij. to the romans /
The law works wrath: and again in the v. to the romans / the law entered
in / that sin should be more abundant.

Of penance.
This office and work of the law is kept and retained in the new testament /
and it is also exercised as.S. Paul says the.i. to the roma saing the wrath of
god from heaven is declared mamifestly against all wickedness and unright wisnes
of men. Item the iij. to the Roma. the whole world is gilty to god. Item no
flessh shall be justified in his sight by the works of the law. Item Johan the
xvi. The holy ghost shall reprove the world of sin. This is the tho^der of god
whereby he does overthrow and clearly condemn not only manifest sinners but
eue^ hypocrytes also / and he brings them in to fear and desperacyon / This
is the hammer whereof Jeremy speaks saing / My word is an hanmer that beats
flynt stonys in to powder.

This is no actyue or procured contricyon but it is a passyne or a suffering
contricyon and breaking / for it is a true or ernest heaviness of the heart / a
very passion / felyng vnd taste of death.

And this is to begin a repentance or a new life and man is compelled to
hear such a sentence as this: Ye are all condemned and confounded / whether ye
be open sinners or hypocrytes / ye must alter your lives and be new men. And
ye must live other wise than ye live now. For how great / wise / mighty and holy
so ever ye be / yet there is none of yo^ just etc. But now unto this office and
co^demnacion of the law / the new testament brings a comfortable promise of
grace and mercy through the gospel / which promise we ought to receive by faith
as christ says March the.i. So penance and believe the gospel: that is to say /
turn amend and live better and believe my promise. And before christ's coming
Johan was called the preacher of penance / but yet unto the remissyon of
sins: that is to say / it was Iohans office to reprove all men and to teach
them that they all were sinners / that they might knnoch what manner of men they
were before god and grant themselves to be damnable sinners. that so they might
be prepared to the lord to embrace his and mercy for their comfort / and to
believe and trust to receive remissyon of their sins of christ.

And so says Christ him self in the last chap. of Luke / penance and
remission of sins must be preached in my name among all nations. Now if the
law should do his office freely alone and the gospel removed / we should se
nothing but death and hell ready to devour us / and there were no remedy but all
men should be compelled to despair as Saul and Judas did / like as.S. Paul
says: The law through sin does kill. But the gospel again / brings comfort
and remissyon of sins / not one way only but diverse / as through the word of
god / through the sacraments and such other ways (as we shall hear here after)
that through him we may haur a plentuos and a rich redempcyo^ (as the cxxx.
Psalm says) against the great captiuyte and thraldom of sin. But we must now
compare the false penance of the popissh dunses and sophisters. With the true
penance that they both may the better be known.

Of the false penance of the papists
It was impossible that ever the papists should teach and preach truly of
penance / sei^g they understood not ^inne truly. For / as is before said / they
have no right judgment or knoulege of original sin / but they teach that the
natural strength of man has ever remained perfight / pure and vncorrupt / that
man's reason ca^ teach rightly. And that his will can perfihhtly obey this right
reason / and again that god does surely give his grace and mercy when a man
does only so much as he is able to do by his own fre will. Wherefore it must needs
follow that they did penance and repent only for actual sins. for the corrupt
affeccyons of the heart / as lust and concupiscens are no sins with them but
they repute those only for sins / which be outward and actual works
springing of their fre will. And of this penance they have made. 3. parts /
Contricyon / Confession and Satisfaccion with this comfort and promise annexed
thereunto that if a man should do true penance / confess himself per^g^y and
make true sati^faccyon / than ^hu^d he merit and de^erue remissyon of his
sins and make a perfect satisfaccyon beford god for all his sins. Thus in
their penance they taught me^ to trust in their own works. And hereupon spra^g
up that which they use to blow out in the pulpets as often as they make mencyon
of the common confession to the people saing O lord god keep and pre^erue my life
until I have done penance for my sins and amended my life. Here is never a
word of christ nor of faith but every man bileueth to wipe a way and dispatch
his sins before god thorov his own works. And for this purpose have many
made them felues pristes and monks that they might so resist and witstond
sin.

As for contricyon this has ever been the manner and order thereof. for as much
as no man could remember all his sins particularly (specially all and every
one that he had committed the whole year /) thus they trifled and dalyd
therewith / that if any secret and preuy sins should afterward come to his
rememberance / he must do penance also for them and teherse them at his next
confession / and in the mean time they were committed to the grace and mercy
of god furthermore because no man could tell certe^ly how great his co^tricyon
ought to be whereby he migh fully satisfye god / they addet this comfort to the
people that he which could not have perfight contricyon / should labor at leaft
to have attricyon / which I may call an half contricyon or a litel spice of
contricyon / for as for they them selves understood neither the one nor the
other and they know no more what these words contricyon and attrieyon do
signifye than I do.

Now this attricyon (as they call it) was reputed sufficyent for contricyon /
when so ever they were confessed. And if it chansed at any time that some man
should say in his confession that he could not have perfect coutricyon or that
he could not lament mourn and be fory for his sins (which thing might happen
in such as were taken and rauisshed with the love of some harlot or in such as
did burn with desire to be revenged of their emnys and cetera) than they to
used to axe such whether he desiered to have co^tricyon / or no. If he answered
/ Yea / (for who would say May / except it were the deuel himself?) than they
took that as sufficient for contricyon / and they forgave him his sins and
assoiled him even for that virtue and good work: alleging for them the example
of.S. Bernard and cet.

Now by this we see how blind man's reason is and how it stombleth in matters of
faith and seeks comfort at her own pleasure in her own proper strength / and
can not ones think neither of CHRIST nor yet of faith.

Now wha^ the matter is brought in to light and seen / This contrityon is
nothing else than a fained and false prete^sed imaginacyo^ sprung up out of the
proper strength of man both without faith and also without any knoulege of
christ in the which contrityon the pore simple sinner would have laughed many
times rather tha^ have wept / specially when his lust and desire of reuengeance
against his emny has comne to his mind and remembera^ce: those only except
whom either the law has thorouly feared or else whom the deuel has vexed and
turmoyled with heaviness of heart. Else / I say / their contricyon was nothing else
than a very right hipocrisy / and it never abated or mortifyed the lust of
sin for men were compelled to contricion / when as they had rather have
sinned more if they might. And as for the manner of their confession this it was
/ Every man was compelled to number all his sins (which was an impossible
thing) And this was an abhomynable tyranny. But such things as he had forgoten
/ he was assoiled of them and they were forgeuen him on this con^yon that
afterward when they came to his (...) he should confess them. And by this me^ a
man could never be sure when he were (...) confessed or when his confession
should (...) an end And yet notwithsto^ding they bad him put his trust in his
work and diligence: for they said that the more purely he were confessed / and
the more that he were ashamed and had dispraised him self before the prist so
much the sooner and better should he satisfye and make ame^dys for his sins /
because such an humbling did merit or deserve grace / favor and mercy before
god. Neither was here also any mencyon of christ. And again the strength and
virtue of absolucyon was not taught nor declared to the penitent neither. And
thus all his comfort did consist in the nombring up of his sins an^ in his
shamefastnes But no man can express with words / what heaviness or sorrow / what
abhominacio^ and filthiness / what Idolatry and supersticyon have grown of this
confession. Finally satisfaccyon is large enough for there was no man in the
world that ever could knouwe how much he ought to do or satisfye for one sin
only / how should he tha^ know how much to do for all his sins?

But they imagined and found out a pretty diuyse / that the pristes should
enjoin their penitentys certain satissaceyons (which they named penance) such
as might easily be kept and performed as these. v. pater nosters and to fast a
day or.ij. and such like / and the residue of their penance they referred to
purgatory there to be fully performed. Was not this now a very misery and a
heavy calamyte also? There were some that supposed and byleued that they should
never go out of purgatory because after the old canons / one deadly sin
requires.vij. years of penance. And still they put trust in their own works
of satisfaccyon. And if their satisfaction could have been a sufficient and
perfight fatisfaccyo^ than might all hope and trust of salvation have been put
altogether in satisfaccyon / in so much that we should have had no neade neither
of faith nor yet of christ. But it was impossible to have such a satisfaccyon.

Now if any man had done penance after this fasshon even for the space of an
hundredth year yet he should never have known when he had done and performed
perfight or sufficient penance. And this were nothing else than alweys to do
penance and yet never to come unto penance. And herein did the court of rome
help pretily to sucker the miserable church / and imagyned pardos whereby he did
remitt penance and brought satisfaccyon enough / first particularly for viij.
years / an hundredth years and cete.

And he d^yded them by lompes among carnals and bisshapes / that some should
have auctorite to grant an.C. years / some an C. Days of pardon.

But he reserved to him self alone to remitt and pardon the whole penance or
satisfaccyon. This thing when it began to smack well and to bring lucre to the
purse / and again for as much as the merchandise and selling of bullys did
prospere and proceed well and luckyly / he imagyned a Goldyn year or a year of
gre which he would have no where but at Rome / and this year full remissyon of
all penaltys / pomisshments / penance and all manner of sins / and thither ran
all men from all parts of the world to fet pardon of the goldyn year. But who
would not have desyered to have been delivered from such an heavy and
intolerable burden? This was even as much as to find and exalt all the
tresures of the earth. But the pope continewed daily in heaping many goldyn
years together one up on another. And the more money he devoured / the gretter
waxed his throat. And thus at length he sent his goldyn year in to other
nacyo^s by his legatys eue^ till all churches and houses were filled and
satisfied with goldyn years finally he brast into purgatory at length also to
the dead sowlys first through Masses / Commendacyons / foundacyons and at last
through his pardons and his goldyn year. What need I to make many words?
Souls were so good cheap that a man might bye as many as he would for ij. pens
or a grote the piece. And yet all this was not sufficient neither for the pope
although he taught and commanded men to put all their trust of salvation in his
pardons / yet not with stonding he made this way dout full and uncertain also.
for he wrote thus in his bullys that who so ever would be partaker of his pardon
and of his goldyn year he must both do penance for all his sins and
confess them and also pay some money. But we have said before that the popissh
contricyon and confession also is both doutful / uncertain and also very
hypocrisy. And beside this / no man did know what soul was in purgatory / and
if there were any yet it was unknown which had true contricyo^ and was rightly
confessed and which not. Here the pope took mo^y and bad them trust in his
penance and pardons and yet not with stonding he sent them again to their own
doutful and uncertain works. Now if there were any / which thought them selves
free from all actual sins / euel affeccyo^s / wicked words and deeds / they
would make the^ selves monks / fryres and pristes in monasterys / collegys and
felouships and they would resist euel desires / with fasting / watchi^g at
midnight / prayer / sayng of masses / hard clothi^g and hard lodgi^g and thus
they went about to be saved by force and violence whether god would or no. But
yet the original or birth sin that was in the^ did sometime paraue^ture
exercise his stre^ght while they were a sleep / as.S. Auste^ and.S. Bierom with
other do grant. And yet these did think and judge among the^ selves that there
were some so holy (as they also taught) that they were with out all sin, full
of god works / in so much that through this hope and trust they dealt and sold
unto other me^ their good works which were superfluos for the^ selves to right
wisnes. This is true / for the seals / writi^gs and tokens thereof be yet to
show. Such had no need of pena^cc them selves. for how could they repent for
any sin wha^ they never consented to any wicked cogitacio^s or thoughts? And
again what co^fessyo^ could they make seeing they eschewed to speak one to
another / for they were sworn to syle^ce: And finally for what thing should they
make satisfaccyo^ sei^g they were gilty of no sins? Even such saints were
the pharisees and scrybes in christ's time: But than immediately came the fyery
Angel and messenger S. Johan / the preacher of true penance and stroke them
both at one clap and with one thonder bolt / saing / do penance. Now the one
sort of the^ though thus / we have done penance al ready? And the other thought
thus / we need not do any penance But.S. Johan says to the^ both do penance
both ij. of you have ever yet done any true penance in your life days / but ye
be hypocrytes and both of you have need of remission of sines becouse ye both
be ignorant / as yet / what sin is properly / much less can you either do
any penance for your sin / or else avoid sin. There is none of you good /
ye be all full of unfaithfulness / of blyndnes of the ignorance both of god and
of his will also But now is he present of whose plenty we all must receive grace
for grace and with out him can no man be justified before god. Wherefore if ye
will do penance / do it rightly and truly. for your penance which have need of
no penance / ye generacyo^s of serpe^tes / who have told you that ye might
avoid the wrath and damnacyo^ to come? etc: S. Paul also preaches like wise
to the romans in the.iij. chapter / saing.

There is none that has any knoulege / there is none that seeks god there is
none that does god no not one: All are beconne unprofitable and have swarued
out of the right way. And again in the 16 of the acts. Now does god preach
unto all men that all should amend their lives. Mark: he sait / all me^ / none
except / that is a man. This penance which Johan and Paul do preach / teaches
us to knoulege our sin / and to grant that we are all damned of our own
nature / that there is no goodness i^ us / and that we must nedys be renewed /
altered and made new me^. This penance is not unperfight / as is that which is
done for actual sins only. Neither is it doutful or incerte^ as that is for
it disputes not which is sin and chhich is not sin / but it conde^neth all
to gether and says there is nothing in you but sin. What need we tha^ to
make any nou^brynh / difference or diuysyo^: Wherefore this co^tricyon also is no
vncerte^ thing. for there is nothing left in us by this co^tricyon whereby we
ca^ so much as think any thing that is good where with we ca^ satifye and make a
me^des for our si^nes but o^ ly very bare and manifest desperacyo^ of all
things which we know / think speak or do. Likewise co^fessyon after this
manner ca^ not be false / vncerte^ and vnperfight. for who so ever confesses
that there is no thing in him but sin he co^prehe^deth all manner of sins
and leaves / excludes or forgets none: finally such a satisfaccyo^ ca^ not
be vncerte^ neither. for it is not our vncerte^ and vnpure work / but it is
the passyo^ and blood of the pure innocent lamb of god which takes a way the
sins of the world. Of this penance did.S. John and after ward christ himself
in the gospel / preach: And of such a penance do we preach also. And by this
penance do we refuse the pope and all things what so ever is bylded up our own
works. for all such things ste^d up on an unclean / feeble yea and a vain
fou^dacyo^ a vain work or law / be it never so good: for weakness / infirmyte
and imperfeccyon remains in all god works and no man fulfilleth the law (as
christ says Ioh. the 8.) but all me^ do tra^sgresse it. Wherefore this bildyng
is nothing but lying / falshode and hipocrisy eue^ wha^ it is most holy and
shows best of all. But the penance that we speak of / endures with all
christian men eue^ til their death / and it fights with the re^nantes of sin
which remain in the flessh / as long as they live / as.S. Paul witnesses the
7. to the Romans saing that he him self warreth against the laue of his
me^bres / and that not with his own proper pour or strength / but with the gift
and grace of the holy ghost which ever cu^penyth and goes together with
remissyo^ of sins. This grace pourgeth and dryueth out daily the re^na^ts of
sin and it co^tendeth or laboreth to make man just pure and holy. Of this
doctrine is the pope with his dyuynes / du^ses / lawyres and such other / as
ignorant as an ass for this doctrine is reuelyd and given from heaven through
the gospel / and yet it is caled heresy of the wicked pharysys and pope holy
hipocrites. And again on the contrary part there be some brayneles dotrels such
as were in the time of sedicyon before my days / and be to find parauenture
eue^ at this day also) which judge and think that all those which have ones
received the holy ghost / their sins / and were ones made faith full / that if
they fall and offend afterward / yet they remain in faith / and that sin
can not hurt or hinder them: And they blase and cry do what thou will / if
thou byleuyst, it makes no matter / for faith wipeth a way all thy sins. And
they add this more over also / that who so ever falls or sins after he is
ones justified / had never the holy ghost perfightly / nor yet true faith.

Such doting mer chantes have I hard many times / and I fear less there be
some yet which are still possessed with this deuel or with such a another.
Wherefore it must be taught and known that both faith and the holy ghost are
absent from all me^wha^ so ever they fall into any manifest sin / as Dauyd
when he did fall into adultery / murder / and blasphemy of god / besides that
they have and feel still their original or birth sin and fight against it
daily also with all their penance. For where so ever the holy ghost is / he will
not suffer sin to exercise his strength or to prevail so far that it be
committed / but the holy ghost refrainet / brydleth and forbids him to do
thvt thing which he would do: And if he do or commit it / than is he destitute
of the holy ghost and of faith also. For.S. Johan says that who so ever is
borne of god commits no sin nor ca^ not sin / and yet notwitsto^ding it
is true that he says afterward / that if we say we have no si^ne / we lie and
the truth of god is not i^ us

Of the gospel.
Now will we come to the gospel which bri^geth council and help against sin /
moo ways tha^ one for god is immeasurably liberal i^ his grace and mercy. first
through the outward word whereby is prea ched and promised remissyo^ of sins
thorowt the whole world / which is the peculyar and proper office of the
gospel. Secondarly through Baptyme.

Thirdly through the supper of the lord: Forthly through the pour of the keys and
through the brotherly co^municacyon and comfort of the faithful one to a another
among them selves matthew the xviij. Where so ever ij. or.iij. be gathered in my
name etc.

Of baptyme
Baptyme is nothing else than the word with the dippyng in to the water after
the co^mandme^t of god. or / as Paul says it is a wasshing / to gether with
the word / like as S. Austen also affirms and says: let the word come or be
joined unto the element / and than is a sacrament. Wherefore we consent not with
S. Thomas nor with the black friars which forgetting christ's institucyon / do
teach and hold that god did indue the water with a spiritual or gostly pour and
virtue / which pour and virtue does wassh a way sines eue^ through the water.
Neither do we agree unto du^s nor the gray frires / which speak never a word
of the ministracyon of it nor of faith nor yet teach that the holy ghost is
given through the word and the sacraments to gether.

Of the baptyme of infantys.
We think that young infantys ought to be baptized because they perteine to the
redempcyon that is promised to mankind through christ. And the church / that is
to say the faithful congregacyon / ought to offer them unto christ.

Of the sacrament of the body and blood of christ
We judge and think that under bread and wyue in the supper of the lord are
given the true body and blood of christ. Item that the whole sacrament ought to
be ministered to the lay people ^ not only one part there of for we have no need
of that high lerning and wisdom which teaches that as much is contained under
one kind as is under both / as the sophistical and popiss^ pharisees and the
counsel of constance do ttach. And though it were true / that as much were
conteinet under one kind as the sophistical papists say / yet the one kind
alone / is not the hole institucyon and ordinance given commanded us of Christ.
And specially we condemn excom^icate and curse / in the name of god / not only
them which will not receive both kinds / but them pri^cipally which do lordly /
vio and tyrannosly forbid / condemn and reprove it as heresy / For as much as
in so ding they set and bend them selves against christ our lord and god / ye
and prefer them selves also before and above him. As for the
transsubstanciacyon / that is to say / that the bread and wine in the supper
should lose their natural substance and only that the similytude form and color
of bread should remain and not very true bread / we pass not up on the suttel
iuglyng imagynacyo^s of the pharisees. For it is very conformable unto the holy
scripture that there should be and remain still / very bread as. S Paul him
self names it / sai^g / The bread which we break etc. Item / and so let him
eat of the bread etc.

Of the keys of the church
The keys are the office and pour of the whole church or co^gregacyon given of
christ to bynd and tv lose sins not only manifest / open and know sins /
but even preuy sinnys also / which god only does know. for as it is written /
who knows how much he sins? and Paul him self in the 7. to the romans
complains that he serves and obeyth the law of sin after his flessh. For
it is not in our pour / but in gods only to judge which be sins / how sore
and greuos all sins are and how manysinnes we have / as it is written / Enter
not into judgment with thy seruact / for no man living shall be rightuos in thy
sight. and Paul the i. to the corynth. the iiij. chap. says I know my self
gilty of nothing but yet I am not therefore justified or rightuos.

Of confession or absolucyon
For as much as absolucyon / or the pour of the keys institute or ordained in
the gospel by christ does bring great comfort to weak co^scye^cys against sin
/ it ought not to be utterly banisshed out of the church for.ij. causes
specially. First for co^forti^g of feeble / fera^ul and weak co^scie^cys.
Seco^darly that wild and reckles youth might be examyned / exercysed and
instruct in the doctrine and knoulege of christ. But as for the no^bring up of
sins ought to be in every ma^s liberty to number and tell only such as he will
him self without any manner of co^pulsyon. For as long as we remain in this
flessh / we shall not lie at all if every one of us say thus: I am a wretched
and a miserable creature full of sins and as.S. Paul says / Roma vij. I feel
a another law in my flessh and me^bres rebelling against the law of my mind
etc. And for as much as private absolucyo^ comes from the power of the keys /
it ought not to be conte^ned but to be much regarded as all other offices
perteining to the christen church ought to be. And in such things as perteine
to the outward word / it must be constantly holde^ and bileued that god gives
his spirit or grace to no man except the outward word either come between or
else goo before. This must be bileued / less we ^all in to the errors of
thorite of god by a certain inward inspiracion without the word also before
they ever they hard of the word: and fret after ward up on this persuasion they
will take up on the^ to judge / i^terprete / wrest and writhe the scripture at
their own pleasure / as one Monetarius did / and I fear there be many at this
time that do likewise / which would be quick and ernest judges between the
spirit and the letter / and yet they know not what to say nor what to teach.
and the papistry is eue^ nothing else tha^ drowned in this heresy and possessed
with this spirit: for the pope bosteth himself to have all manner of laws i^
his own bosom and even under his girdel / and that what so ever he with his
church does judge / determine and co^ma^d that must needs be of the holy ghost /
and just or lauful / although it be clean contrary to the scripture or to the
outward word. and this is eue^ the old Satan and serpent which entysed and
brought Ada^ and Eve in to the self same heresy / and he drew hi^ clean a way
from the outward word unto a certain spu^alnes and unto his own fansys or
imaginacyo^s and yet the deuel wrought this matter by other outward wodes /
like as our heretics also do co^de^ne the outward word and yet they the^
selves hold not their tu^ges but fill the whole world with their babli^g
clattri^g / and writi^g: as though the spirit could not come through the
outward word of god but only through their writi^gs and their words and whi- do
they not leave their preachi^g also till that spi^ite of theirs unto me^ with
out their writi^g and before their writi^g / as they bost that it came unto
the^ with out any preaching of the scripture? But it is no time now to speak
more largely of them.

I have entreated sufficiently of them in other places. And even they which
believe before they be baptized or which receive faith at their baptyme / they
have it through the outward word going before / as they which be of perfight age
and have any understanding must needs have hard before this word / Who so ever
bileueth and is baptized shall be saved: al though at the first they were
infidels and received both the holy ghost and baptime also eue^ x. year after.
and Cornelius in the x. of the acts had hard long before among the Jews that
christ and messiah should come through whom he was just before god / and his
prayers and alms were acceptable through his faith / as luke callleth hi^ just
faitful and vertuos. And surely he could never have bileued truly nor yet have
been justified without the word or without the hearing of it. And therefore it
was necessacy for S. Peter to reuele and open unto him that the Messiah (in
whom not yet reveled he had byleued until that time) was now come that he should
not bileue still with the vnfathful and blind Jews that christ was yet to come
/ but rather that he should know that he must obtain eue^lasti^g saluacyo^
through the messyas that was come and already present and that he should not
deny / and persecute this messiah / as the Jews did. But to conclude the
effect of the matter brefely this heresy sown in Ada^ and his childern or
posterite from the begi^ming until the e^d of the world through the old serpent
and dragon / is the original begi^mi^g fou^tayn / stre^ght / and pour of all
heresy / of all papistry and of all Mahometes doctrine also. Wherefore / I say we
must determine this pri^cipaly / that god works with me^ no notherwise tha^
through his outward word and sacrament and what so ever me^ blow and blase of
the spirit with out this outward word and this facrame^t / it is nothing else
tha^ the very deuel god would not first appear and show hi^ self unto moises
/ but through the fyery / red / and vocal word. And Johan baptist was neither
conceived withoue the word of gabriel goi^g before / neither did he leap i^
his mothers womb^ without the voice of mary goi^g before. and S. Peter says
that the prophets did not propheci through the will of man / but through the holy
ghost / for they were holy me^ etc. but yet they were not holy with out the
outward word / much less would the holy ghost have moved the^ to have prophesied
if they had been as yet profane and wholly. For they were holy / says he /
when the holy ghost did speak through the^

Of Exco^municacyon
As for the great exco^municacio^ as the pape calleh it / we take it only for a
civil pomisshme^t / and therefore it pertains nothing unto us which be
ecclesiastical ministers. But the true and right christian exco^municacion
whereby manifest open and obstinateer common ordinances of the church and oath
until they repent amend and forsake their sins / pertains unto us / and
preachers ought not to join the civil pomishme^t to this spiritual pomishme^t.

Of geui^g of ordres and of the calli^g of ministers
If bisshops would be right bisshops and take cure of the church and of the
gospel / tha^ for charites and for unites sake / we would permit the^ (but not
as it were a necessary article of the faith) to ordeine / admit and confirm
all ministers and preachers / so that all folisshnes / charmi^g / co^iuring and
all manner of wicked ceremonys were removed and set apart. But now for as much
as they be not nor will not be right true bisshops but rather temporal and civil
lords and rulers / and will neither teach / preach baptize minister the
sacraments nor do any other worck or office that pertains to the church but
only persecute and condemn such as serve and minister truly in the church
acordi^g to their vocacio^ / the church ought not to ^e destitute of true
ministers and therefore as the old examples of the church in fore time and of the
old fathers also do teach us / we will and be bownd our selves to ordeine apt
and mete parsons for such offices which thing they ca^ not deny nor forbid us
to do eue^ by their own law. For their own laws do say and affirm plai^ly
that such as be ordained and admitted to the office of a prist by heretics /
to be laufully admitted and that this admissyon ought not to be disamulled or
changed again. As.S. Hierom writes of the church of alexandria that at the
first it was como^ly and governed by pristes and preachers with out any
bisshopes at all.

Of the marriage of pristes
Where as they have forbidden marriage to pristes and have lade^ the order of
pristhode i^stitute by god with perpetual chastity / they have done unlawfully
and wickedly and like ungodly / tyra^nical and damnable wretches. And by this
act they have ministered occasyo^ to all kinds of abominable sins / and most
filthy and i^numerable lusts and vices wherein they remain and are drowned as
yet. Wherefore like as neither we nor they have no pour to make a woman of a man
or a man of a woman / Or utterly to destroy both man and woman / eue^ so have
neitheir we nor they no pour to separate the creatures of god one from a another
or to forbid the^ to dwell to gether one with a another honestly and godly in
matrimony. And therefore we ca^ in no wise neither allow nor yet abide this
compelled single life. but we will have marriage to be fte unto all me^ as it is
ordained and i^stitute by god / neither will we undo or hi^dre his worck for.S.
Paul says that it is tde deuels doctrine so to do.

Of the church.
We will not grant the pope with his adhere^tes to be the church / for they be
not in very deed: and we will not obey those things which they co^ma^d or forbid
in the name of the church. for a child of vij. year old thanks be to god)
does know what the church is namely that it is a number of holy and faithful
me^ and that is a flock of such sheep as hear the voice of their own pastor:
for thus do our childern pray / sai^g I believe the holy catholic church etc
This holiness consists not in typets / shaue^ crowns / long gowns and such
other folissh ceremenys inverted of their own brain with out any word of the
holy scripture. But it consists in the word of god and in true and perfect
faith

How we are justified and saved before god and of good wockes
What so ever I have continually taught until this day / of this matter / I
ca^in no wise change it / namely that we obtain a new and a clean heart and
mind / through faith: and that god will and does accept and cownt us for just and
holy for christ's sake our mediator. And although sin is not yet thoroughly
quenched / mortifyed and killed in our flessh / yet god will not impute it to
he^ that bileueth perfitely. and such a faith / such a renewyng and remission
of sins is never without good works goi^g with him and imperfeccyo^ as yet
in those warkes yet through the same christ and for his sake it shall not be
reputed for sin / but the mhole man both in his person and i^ his works shall
be called and shall be in deed / just and holy only through the grace and mercy
i^ christ power and a^plifyed p^e^tuosly up on us *Wherefore We can not glory nor
bost of the merits of our works / if they be co^sidred with the grace and
mercy of god: but he that gloryth / let hi^ glory in the lord / that is to say
let hi^ glory that he has god merciful and favorable unto hi^ and so is all
well. Furthermore we add this also / that if good works goo not with faith /
it is no true / but a false faith.

Of the vows of monks frires and such other
For as much as the vows of religios me^ do directly repugne with the
pri^cipal of our faith they ought to be broken and utterly to taken a way. for
they be of the number of those things whereof christ speaks / Math 24. sai^g I
am christ etc. For he that voweth to live after the religyo^of monks and
frires he bileueth that he professes a more perfect state of liui^g tha^ the
common sort of christian men / and he goes about to bring unto heaven by his
works not only himself but other also / and this as much as to deny christ.
They make this bost also as Thomas does that their vows be be equal unto
baptyme which is a co^tumelios blasphemy against god.

Of man's tradicyons
Whereas the papists affirm that man's tradicyo^s be profitable unto remissyo^
of sinnys or that they merit and deserve everlasting saluacya^ it is a wicked
and a damnable blasphemy. For christ says they honor me in vain with men's
tradicyons. Ite^ Paul. They refuse and deuye the truth thorvw the precepts of
men. And more over whereas they say that it is deadly sin to break such-
tradicyons / it is a false lie. These be the sums and pri^cipal articles
wheri^ I must abide remain and I will also / by the grace of god / defend /
mai^teyne and stand by the^ even til my death. And I ca^ not see / what I ought
to change alter or to yield in the^. If any man will yield and remit any thing in
the^ let him do it with the perel and danger of his own co^sciens. finally
there remain yet cette^ disceiteful mistes of the pope co^cerni^g folissh and
childissh articles as namely about the halowi^g of churches and about the
baptizing of belllys / of altars and of altar stonys and of their godfathers
and of such as give any momy to such things. Which manner of baptizi^g such
things is a very blasphemy and a derisyo^ of the reverend sacrament of baptyme
/ and therefore it ought not to be suffered. Of this number also are the articles
of the halowi^g of candles palms / cakes / herbys / otes and such other. This
can not be called nor be in deed any true co^secracyon or halowing but rather a
derisyo^ and a co^iuring. There are an infinyte sort of such other disteiteful
and iuggli^g imaginacyo^s / which we leave to their god the pope and to the^ to
honor til their bellys brast / we will not be voked with such things / but fre
in every condicyon.

Finis.
