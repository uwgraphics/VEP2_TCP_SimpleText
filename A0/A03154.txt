A comfortable new Ballad of a Dream of a Sinner,being very (...) troubled
with the assaults of Satan
To the tune of Roger


IN slumbring slleepe I lay
all night alone in bed,
A vision very strange
there came into my head,
Me thought the day of doom
undoubtedly was come,
And Christ himself was there
to judge both all and some.
My self was sent for there
with sound of Trumpet shrill,
Which said, All souls come hear
your sentence good or ill.
I sat in mind amazed,
at that same sudden voice,
For in mine own good life
no whit I could rejoice.
With panting breast I paused
at that same sudden sight,
Not trusting to my self,
but to Christ's mercies great.
I was no sooner meant,
but Satan came, me thought,
With him a role full large
of all my life he brought*
And laid before the Lord
how that I was his own,
And would have had me then,
my sins so great were grown
I quaking lay with fear,
and wist not what to do,
But in the blood of Christ
I trusted still unto.
Then said our Savior Christ,
foul Satan end thy strife*
Look if the sinners name
be in the book of life.
If he be entered there,
then must he needs be blessed,
His sins be washed away,
his soul with me shall rest.
Then Satan took the book,
did leaf by leaf unfold,
And there he found my name
in letters limbed with gold.
Then Satan sorrowed much
at that same sudden sight.
And said unto the Lord,
thy Judgments are not right
And thus our Savior sweet
said to him by and by,
Thou, Satan, know full well
that I for sin did dye.
Redeeming all the world,
once overthrown by thee,
And so will save all such
as truly trust in me.
My mortal foe was wroth,
that he had lost his prey,
Extremely vexed was,
and vanished quite away*
But I that thus was bill'd
within that blessed book,
Out of my stumbring sleep
so joyfully awoke.
Still praying to the Lord,
that always sinners may
From Satan be set free,
at the last dreadful day.
That after earthly toils,
we may heaven joys attain,
Here learn to live to d(...)
that we may live again.
Our noble royal King.
God grant him long to reign
To live in joy and peace,
the Gospel to maintain.
FINIS
