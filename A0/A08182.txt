TO HIS WORSHIPFVL GOOD FRIEND, MASTER THOMAS WROTH an affecter and favorer of
the Muses.
THis Cuckowes poem let me thus excuse
To you (dear friend, the Patron of my verse)
Though some blind night-born Momus it abuse,
As but a jest unworthy to rehearse:
Yet who such jests, as this shall idly blame,
Shall for their meede merit a Cuckowes name.
I speak not this; but that in future time,
When as my wit with riper fruit shall grow,
My Muse may speak to thee in sweeter ryme,
And for thy worth some grauer poem show:
Mean time accept of what I here do bring,
Though Cuckow-like my Muse does harshly sing.
Yours at command, R. NICCOLLS.

TO THE READER.
I Know that the nature of our Cuckoo is a thing so well known, that I need
not despair of any man's knowledge herein; and therefor for me (especially in
these parts where it is so well known) to present only a Cuckoo, were to bring
an Owl to Athens, a bird better known there then a Cuckoo. Wherefore (gentle
Reader) lea^ing the literal exposition to him, that is better skild in the
nature of a Cuckoo, then my self, I remit the cause of my affect in this
subject, to thy deeper consideration. To the prodigal wantwits of our age,
that are either too curious to contemn al, or too free to affect all, let them
know, that I neither despair at the furious frowns of the one, neither rely
upon the fawning fancy of the other: only I submit my self to the censure of
him, that is more then a mere reader, to whom I do impart part of my poor
poetical skill, upon which I have bestowed some idle hours; idle I call them,
not in disgrace of so famous a skill: but to give the world notice, that I make
it not the chief part of my profession: but rather place it amongst those
things of accomplement required in a scholar, or gentleman; which if (gentle
Reader) thou shall gently accept, my newborn Muse, that now sings harsh and
hoarse in the shape of a Cuckoo, may by thy encouragement hereafter sing to
thee in a more pleasing note. And so wishing, that her obscurity and
vnacquaintance with thee, be not the bar of her good intertainment in thy
conceit, as being but a stranger: yet as friend, I bid thee Farewell.

THE CVCKOW.
WHen Perseus bride, that star of heaven had fled
The Dragons paw by help of Gorgons head,
And on the sea-gods golden-edged brim
Her gold-out-glistring locks began to trim:
Then did the lusty Ram with horned crest
Rouse up Europas grim-curl'd-headed beast,
Who loudly bellowing did chase away
The tedious night, and called back cheerful day.
For then Hyperions son, the days bright king
In pomp did court the Lady of the spring;
And she again in all her rich array
Did wanton with him in lascivious play,
Until her womb with loves sweet fruit did grow,
The sweetest fruit, that womb did ever show:
For it brought forth the worlds admired birth,
The (...) (...) Flora, (...) fairest child on earth;
Who in short time did grow so great in fame
For needle work, that never any dame,
Although her cu^ing were exceeding rare
With fair (...) Floraes skill might make compare:
To show the which, the world she set on wing
Of sweet delight, to welcome in the spring:
The mountain tops she clad in coat of green,
And spotted them with gold as they had been
Starrie Olympi; and the vales below
She decked with daintier work, then art can show;
Upon the ground mantled in verdent hew,
Out of her fruitful lap each day she threw,
The choicest flowers, that any curious eye
In natures garden ever did epsy:
The lofty trees, whose leauie locks did shake
And with the wind did daliance seem to make,
She with sweet breathing blossoms did adorn,
That seemed to laugh the winter past to scorn,
Who when mild Zephirus did gently blow
Delightful odors round about did throw;
While joyous birds beneath the leauie shade,
With pleasant singing sweet respondence made
unto the murmuring streams, that seemed to play
With silver shells, that in their bosom lay:
Thus with delight did Flora deck each thing
To welcome in her mother joyful spring,
Who had not long triumphed in this our clime
Before the tidings of her joyous prime
Were spread abroad, which, when those birds that shrunk
Into the wooden walls of hollow trunck,
For truth did hear, abroad they boldly came
To welcome Lady Ver, that lovely dame;
Mong'st whom two chief there were, Dan Cuckoo hight;
In whom god Vulcans love took most delight,
The other that sweet singer Philomel,
Or Casta hight, whom Phoebe loved well:
These two were chief, that in contention stood
Amongst the pleasant singers of the wood
To be chief carroler and lead the ring,
Of all the rest to welcome in the spring.
Dan Cuckoo was a bird hatched in that hour,
When Mars did sport in Cythereas bower,
Whereby the note, which his hoarse voice does bear
Is harsh and fatal to the wedded ear:
But little Philomela far more blessed
Was fostered in fair Phoebes own dear breast,
Whom she no more the Nightingale did name;
But to consort her nature to the same
She called her Casta, word of much import,
And made her chief of birds in their consort.
Betwixt Dan Cuckoo and this little bird
The Approach of spring a great contention stird,
Who should be deemed the chief of birds to bring
The happy tidings of the approaching spring:
For Philomel once in a pearlie morn,
When heaven with sun-bright looks did earth adorn
Hearing each bird record her curious lay,
Unto the wood with speed did take her way,
Where she did press into the thickest throng
And did so sweetly in delicious song
Chaunt out aloude her welcome to the spring,
That all the birds did cease to hear her sing:
But as she sat admired of every one,
Redoubling quauers in division,
And sweetly warbling out that chaste set song,
Which Phoebe taught to her when she was young,
Dan Cuckoo came, and from his greedy throat
breathing out ditties of an unchaste note,
As wroth that other birds should seek to make
Her mistres of the quier, thus boldly spoke:
Thou wretch (said he) what high aspiring spirit
Does harbor in thy breast? what is thy merit
That thou should be chief carroler to sing
Amongst us all to welcome in the spring?
Is not my dame the goddess of delight,
And Queen of Love, whose altars are bedight
With broad blown blossoms of the blooming spring,
Of budding youth: then cease and let me sing;
For I of birds am chiefest in her sight
And in my ditties she takes most delight:
Then cease thou fondling cease, and let me sing
A pleasing welcome to the wanton spring.
This said, he chaunted out his wonted lay,
Which did in woods all wedded birds affray:
But little Casta naught at all dismaide,
Being safely shrouded in the leauie shade
Returned this short reply: (Cuckoo) (quoth she)
What thou have said, I grant; yet now hear me.
Where dainty dames are dight to wanton sin
Loosely araid youths wandering eyes to win,
Whom slick-hair'd slipper-lossels do dispoile
Of beauties, bud with loves sweet seeming toil,
While smock sworn boys stand by and keep account,
How often aloft they lustily do mount;
There with good right may thy harsh sounding throat
Without control record thy bastard note.
But in all woods, where my fair virgin dame
With her chaste Nymphs did keep laborious game
To slack the strength of loves bow-bending string,
Thou must not speak thy welcome to the spring:
For Phoebes self with all her Nymphs consent
Did make me chief of birds, for that intent.
This said, Dan Cuckoo perfect in the sleight Of cunning guile, and knowing loves delight
Had thrilled their hearts, that in fair Phoebes grove
Once ranged at will in scorn of Lady love,
Made this reply: (quoth he) seeing thou do vaunt
Of Phoebe and her Nymphs, thereby to daunt
My courage in this claim, I do agree,
That they decide the cause 'twixt thee and me;
And if they judge thy note the sweeter sound,
Chief singer of the quier, thou shall be crowned:
But if to them my song more pleasing be,
To make me che^fe in woods, thou shall agree.
Casta being swift to give such counsel ear
Supposing Phoebes Nymphs, such love did bear
To chaster thoughts, that they would all detest
The unchaste dittie of Dan Cuckowes breast,
Was well contented that it should be so
And with Dan Cuckoo for this cause did go,
Unto the bower of bliss, for so it hight,
Where then those Nymphs to be did most deligh^.
It is a place, that thoughts cannot devise
A plot more like unto a Paradise;
Shall I compare it to Cytheron green,
On which the warre-god did compresse loves queen,
Or to Adonis garden far renowned,
In which eternal spring is ever found?
O far more pleasant is this pleasant place,
Then all the blisfull bowers beneath heavens face!
It seated is far in a pleasant wood,
Where many a lofty Iouiall tree has stood,
Not much unlike, that wood by thornie grove
Full of the tree erected unto Jove,
Which seated is upon the Northern Strand,
Where Saxon Segberts sacred tower does stand,
By which the Prince of Albions watrie deepes
From the French Ocean with swift current sweepes,
Wafting each year by his Labrynthian strand,
More then a thousand keele from foreign land,
Who often, when Boreas at their safety raues,
And with proud blasts does cuffe the silver waves,
Do nimbly fe^ch Lauolto^s up and down
Upon the waves in scorn^ of Boreas frown:
And ^uch a famous w^od, ^s that, is this,
In which does stand the pl^sant bower of bliss:
Unto the which, wh^ as Dan Cuckoo came
Knowing each w^y, (...) led throughout the same,
With Philomel h^ (...) the r^ady way,
Which to the bow^r of bliss dir^ctly lay;
Where in the way they both amazed stood
To see the pleasance of tha^ (...) wood,
There many blissful bowers they did behold;
Whose dwelle^s neither vexed with heat nor cold
Did there enjoy all things, that might delight
The cu^ious ^ie of any living wight:
For pl^ntie th^e to lavish in her gift
Furnished each place in scorn of niggard thrift;
There many Nymphs of more then heavenly hew
Had their abode; although alas but few
Amongst them all did come of heavenly kind,
So hard it is to gain the gifts of mind:
Yet stately portance, unto them was given
And in proportion like the stares of heaven
They bare thems^lues: yet want both will and power
From loves assault to shield fair beauties bower
And more to beautify the goodly frames,
Which God and nature gave these goodly dames,
Gentry their cradles at their birth did rock
And drew their lineage from an ancient stock:
But what alas a^ailes the vading flower
Of beauties bud in those, that have no power
To guide the least part of the weaker sense
And learn the lesson of pure continence?
Or what is birth to those, that so they win
The seeming sweetness of alluring sin?
Bastard their birth and all their stock deprau^
To gain the thing, which appetite does crave:
Beauty in such, though much, is but disgrace,
And high borne birth, though kingly, yet but base.
For fair is foul, where virtue is unknown,
And birth is base, where gifts of grace are none.
From hence Dan Cuckoo with fair Philomel,
(Acquainted with each passage very well)
Forward proceeded in this pleasant wood
Until they came unto that place, where stood
The bower of bliss it self, so fairly decked,
That never eye beheld so fair aspect:
In th'ou^er portch sat many a slick-hear'd Squier
Of pleasing semblance, full of loose desire,
Of feature fit to feast a Ladies e^e;
But manly exercise unfit to try:
Their cunning did consist in sleights of love,
With which from loy^ltie they often did move
Ladies frail hea^s: for unto many a one
They vowed them^elues; though faithful unto none,
Unto the secrets of the vnc^aste she^t
They sworn were, an oath for ^ch unmeet:
For which their service ofte^imes they fed
On ransackt swee^nes of the nup^iall bed:
But let not such disco^rse d^file my pen
With argument* of such reproachful men;
Let it suffice that (...), as they ^o bring
Dan Cuckoo here to welcome in our spring.
Mong'st these, there was a squier of greatest place
And cheifest held in that great Ladies grace,
Which dwelt in this same bower: for many a night
With her he stole a snatch of loves delight:
For he was lusty, young, fit for her tooth,
And her great wealth did well content his youth.
Yet he was false, disloyal to his dame;
For in his common talk deuoid of shame
He of his Ladies favor was too francke,
For which I con that lover little thank;
He was the usher to this dainty dame
And Vanity men gave him unto name,
To whom Dan Cuckoo often louting low
By his obsequious signs his mind did show
And chaunted out to Philomels disgrace
His unchaste note, well known in that same place:
For this same Squier full well I wot did know
Dan Cuckowes note and unto him did go,
Where seeing little Casta by him stand,
Cause of their coming friendly did demand:
Dan Cuckoo proud of such an intertaine
Did tell the jar begun betwixt them twain,
Who should be chief of all the birds to sing
As herbenger to welcome in the spring,
And now to end the same, they both were come
Agreed to stand unto the wood-Nymphes doom;
Wherefore they craved access unto his dame,
That with her Nymphs she might decide the same:
This gentle Squier soon granted their requests
And kindly did conduckt his new come guests
Into an in ward court, where they should stay,
Till to his dame their message he did say;
Where, while they staid, with great delight they spent
The time in viewing this fair continent,
This bower of bliss, this paradise of pleasure,
Where lavish plenty did exceed all measure;
The inner portch seemed entrance to entice,
It fashioned was with such quaint rare device,
The top with cannopie of green was spread
Thickened with leaves of th'Iuies wanton head,
About the which the Eglentine did twine
His prickling arms the branches to combine,
Bearing sweet flowers of more then fragrant odor,
Which stellified the roof with painted color;
On either side the vine did broad dilate
His swollen veins with wreathings intricate,
Whose bunches to the ground did seem t'incline,
As freely offering of their luscious wine:
Through this same portch went many a worthy wight
Unto the bower of bliss, both day and night,
Who at their entrance fresh and flush as May
Did bear themselves adorned in rich array:
But few returned without the common curse
Of strange disease of emptiness in purse,
Who wanting golden shewers for Danaes lap,
As discontented with their sad mishap
Walked to and fro, forlorn in deep disdain
With willow branch, for prise of all their pain.
From this same portch, a walk directly lay,
Which to the bower it self did lead the way
With fruit trees thick beset on either side,
Whose goodly fruit themselves did seem to hide
Beneath the leaves, as lurking from the eyes
Of strangers greedy view, fearing surprise,
Whose arched bows and leauie twigs together
With true love knots entangled each in other,
Seemed painted walls, on which when Zephire blew
They spread themselves, disclosing unto view
The blossoms, buds, the birds and painted flies,
That in their leaves lay hid from strangers eyes;
This walk of people never empty was:
For to the bower of bliss one could not pass;
But that the way did swarm with ietting iacks,
Who bare upon their french diseased backs,
Whole manners, castles, towns and Lordships sold
Cut out in clippings and in shreds of gold:
Their chambring fortitude they did descrie
By their soft maiden voice and flickering eye,
Their woman's manhood by their clothes perfumed,
Coy looks, curled locks, and thin beards half consumed,
Whose nice, effeminate and base behavior
Was counted comely, neat and cleanly gesture;
This pleasant walk, when gentle Philomel
And Cuckoo her proud foe had viewed well
Passing forth, one lo there they did behold
High lifted up with lofty roof of gold
The bower of bliss, in which there did abide
The Ladies self, that should their cause decide,
On which the heavens still in a steadfast state
Looked always blithe, diuerting ^roward fate,
Not suffering y^ie frost, or s^rching sun
To vex th'in habitants, that there did won:
For there eternal spring does ever dwell,
Nay they of other season ought can tell,
They labor not with hands of industry
To furrow up the earthes fertility,
Bubbles of sweat decline not from their brow,
Ne stooping labor makes their backs to bow:
Yet plenty of all fruits upon their ground,
Seedlesse and artlesse every where is found:
Unto this bower Dan Cuckoo and his mate
Approaching nigh, lo standing at the gate,
Which framed was of purest Iuorie
All painted ore with many a history,
So sweetly wrought, that art in them did seem
To mock at nature as of no esteem,
Eftsoons they heard a pleasing harmony
Of musikes most melodious minstralsie,
Where sweet voic'd birds, soft winds and waters fall,
With voice and Violl made agreement all,
The birds unto the voice did sweetly sing,
The voice did speak unto the Viols string,
That to the wind did sound now high now low,
The wind to waters fall did gently blow;
Thus birds, voice, Violl, winds and waters all
Did sing, did speak, did sound, did blow, did fall:
As thus Dan Cuckoo and his opposite,
The Nightingale stood harkening with delight
Unto this music, lo that Squire came
Hight Vanity with answer from his dame,
That'gainst the morn themselves they should prepare,
Their cause in ample manner to declare;
For with her Nymphs in judgment she would sit,
And which of them, they should esteem most fit,
She would denounce for chief in woods to sing,
As herbinger unto the joyful spring:
This news did glad them both; for both did feed
Themselves with hope: although but one could speed
And both prepared each other to excel
In the next morn, to bear away the bell:
The little Philomel with curious care,
Sitting alone her ditties did prepare,
And many tunes, whose harmony did pass
All music else that ere invented was;
One while the mean part she did sweetly warble,
The tennor now, the Base and then the trebble:
Then all at once with many parts in one,
Dividing sweetly in division;
Now some sweet strain to mind she does restore,
Which all the winter she had conn'd before,
And with such cunning deskants thereupon,
That curious art nere doctrin'd any one
With Lute, with Violl, or with voice in quier,
That to her matchless music might aspire:
Mean time Dan Cuckoo, knowing that his voice
Had no variety, no change, no choice:
But through the wesand pipe of his harsh throat
Cried only Cuckoo, that prodigious note,
That want with wits supply he did amend,
And made that Squier, Vanity his friend,
Who did so work for him, as it befell,
That judgment went against poor Philomel.
The time came on, and th'Opall colored morn,
Bright-cheek^ Aurora leaning all sorlorne
Old Tytho^ in his bed, did up arise
Opening the gates of the oriental skies,
Through which the days bright king came dancing out
With glorious golden locks bespread about
His s^oulders broad; from whence such luster came,
That all the world did seem a golden flame:
For then Auroraes trumpe, the peasants clock,
Days herbinger, the bloody crested cock
With flaggie wings had beat black night away,
And sung sweet tidings of approaching day,
At which both birds up starting from their rest
Quaintly to plead their cause, themselves addressed,
Which with her Nymphs, that day in solemn state
The Lady of this bower should debate,
Which flying fame upon her wings did bear,
Making it vulgar news in every ear,
And with her silver trumpe did Echo out
Report thereof, in all the woods about;
Which once being blown abroad, all the whole quier
Of singers in the wood with great desire,
(To know in this same strife, who should prevail
Dan Cuckoo, or the little Nightingale)
Came flocking through the air, and as they flew,
Their diverse warbling notes about they threw;
There came the Lark, who still as she did fly
With outstretcht' wings aspired the cloud brow'd sky,
There Progne came who did present for food
In tragic feast, her own dear ^tis blood
To bloody Tereus, in auengment fell
Of sister dear Pandions Philomel,
Who now transformed unto the sent-strong Swallow,
Shaftlike did fly through the airs concaue hollow;
With these there came the Thrush, that loves the grape,
The speckled Spinck, that lives by gummie sap,
The Redbrest sweet, that loves the looks of men,
The lustful Sparrow and the little Wren,
The chattering Pie, the quick conceited Stare,
The golden Finch and Linnot singing rare
With many more, whose notes the air did fill
With true consort, sweet work of natures skill,
Who to the bower of bliss did take their way,
To h^are the jar decided, that same day,
Which the approach of spring did late excite
Be^wixt Dan Cuckoo and his opposite:
The place, in which this matter should be tried
Was in a green pailde round on every side,
In which was pight a stately cannopi^;
For that great (...) and her company,
Many a (...) Nymph of great estate,
That should that day Dan Cuckowes cause debate;
Who being pearch^ aloft in open sight
Upon a (...) branch, had well ydight
And decked his plumes to make a pleasant show,
When he should plead his cause against his foe,
Who on the other side her self did place,
In hope Dan Cuckoo foulely to disgrace,
Not doubting but those Nymphs for Phoebes sake
In this so iusta cause, her part would take:
The time being come, lo like as when Jove's bride,
Heavens Iuory fingered queen in pomp does ride
To heavens high court, above the Planets seven,
To sit in counsel with the gods of heaven:
Even so forth comes that fair renowned dame,
Chiefest of all the bower of bliss, that came
To judge the controversy that befell,
Betwixt Dan Cuckoo and fair Philomel,
She was a Ladi^ gaudie in attire
And to content th'affect of her desire,
Th'earthes golden bowels often wounded were
And th'Indian slave with steel did often tear
The hard rocks rubie ribs in hope to find
Treasure to pleasure her disdainful mind:
Proudly she pas'd it with a princely gate,
As earth had been too mean for her estate,
Looking to heaven with her disdain^ull eyes;
For humble object she did still despise:
Yet was her birth but mean, and her esteem
Respectively compa^'d, but base did seem,
Loosely she was aray'd in wanton weed
Which wander^s eyes did with inticement feed,
For she was clad in robe of tissue thin,
Through which so brim appeared her snowie skin,
That it did seem to those, that did it see,
No whit obscured, but far more white to be;
Her Iuorie breasts did ever open lie
To ready spoil of gazers greedy eye,
And both her lilly paps were bare to win
Her lovers melting heart to wanton sin;
Her name the which was Meehafasto hight
Her double nature did express aright:
With her there hither came a goodly crew
Of lovely Nymphs of seeming Angels hue,
Featured each where in bodies li^eament,
As if they late had left the firmament,
Or as if heavens divine triplicitie,
Out of some fifth unknown simplicity,
For (...) complexions hue had framed some mixture,
Passing (...) homely gift of common nature:
But pi^ie 'twas, such angell-seeming creatures
With vlcerous minds deformed such heavenly features:
For they were wanton, full of loose desire
And in their heart did nourish lustful fire,
With glauncing looks, like summers evening lights
They could allure the rash beholders sights,
And Heliotropon-like with sun-like skill
Could cause soft hearts to turn unto their will,
When they list speak, their words like to a lake
Breaking through rocks of rubie, seemed to make
Celestial music with their pleasing sound,
Amongst the silver pearls, that stood around,
With which they Syren-like could often move
Modest Hypolitus to wanton love,
They all acoutered were in sundry fashion,
Seeming to have been all of a several nation,
Some in the antique Roman Lords attire
Did shape themselves, as seeming to aspire
Some captains place, or as if they had been
Symiramis, that manlike monster queen,
In Persian loose array, some did delight,
Or rather disaray, so loosely dight,
In the french doublet some again did i^t
wanting but slops to make a man complete,
Some on their heads did bear the fatal sign,
Which of fools future fortune did divine,
Others again Morisko caps did wear
Maid-marrian-like with brooches in each ear
And Indian-like did paint inch thick in view;
Though natures red and white were Angels hew.
Thus with their fashions strange variety,
They did bewray their minds inormitie:
For things external sought with strong affect,
Internal thoughts both good and bad detect,
Which, when the little Casta did behold
Poor bird her fearful heart did wax stone cold:
But now too late she did repent, that she
Had made them judges of her cause to be:
For thither now, they were already come
According to their minds to give their doom,
Where heaps of people thronging in the way
Did early wait for them by break of day
To know, what bird should bear away the bell
The bastard Cuckoo or fair Philomel:
The judges being set, up straight did stand,
The crier of the court who did command
High, with shrill voice and great authority
A general silence through the company;
Which done forth stepped the little Casta hight,
Who being pearcht aloft in open sight
After obeisance to those damsels made,
That were as judges set, thus boldly said:
(Fairest of fair) who from the joyous prime
Of your great birth, until this very time,
Have trained been in this celestial place,
This bower of bliss in virtue and in grace,
For virtues sake vouchsafe with silent pause
To hear poor Philomela plead her cause.
What once I have been, now I need not tell,
Nor what I am, I know, ye know it well:
Ye know, that once, when in great Athens town
My Sire, good king Pandion wore the crown,
A Lady then I was, as now ye be
And daughter to a king, till woe is me,
The Thracian king, whose lust-burnt thoughts did flame
And burn in foul desire, did work my shame:
In Thracian woods (O ever be forgot
The place in which mine honor he did blot)
In Thracian woods (I say) the tyrant fell
Unto his will did force poor Philomel,
And lest his wicked act I should des^rie
The cruel edged steel he did apply
Unto my tongue, and with most bitter smart
Did rob me of the Echo of my heart:
All this and more then this, ye all do know
So common is poor Philomelaes woe.
Ye know likewise how in auengement fell
My furious sister, Progne did compel
The lustful Tereus in a fatal feast
To swallow down into his lust-burnt breast
His own dear son, his Itis, that sweet youth,
Whose death breeds in my heart eternal ruth:
For which when as the tyrant did decree
With wrathful sword to wreake revenge on me
Heaven pity took and gave to me this shape,
By which his fell intent I did escape,
And as an exile from all men's abode
I since have lived in the desert wood,
Where sitting once on humble thorn alone
And in my woeful di^ties making moan
For my old Sire, Pandion, that good King,
Whose timelesse death my sad mischance did bring;
Lo^, That great Huntresse of renowned fame,
The Lady Phoebe following the game,
In the wild wood has silent stood in pity
To hear the sad tunes of my doleful (...),
And being mo^'d with deep remorse of mind
That fates had been so (...) and vnk^d
Against me poor wretch, she did vou^hsafe to show
Compassion toward me in my bitter woe.
While in these woods and (...) she did use,
Mong'st all the quier for chief, she (...) me c^use
To be her bird, and while she was my dame
Not Philomel, but Casta was my name,
And, for I was the daughter of a King,
She made me chief of all the quier to sing,
And in her woods ordained me the shade
To shroude my self from Tereus bloody blade:
But lo alas, what time has brought to pass,
Lo here a tyrant, worse then Ter^us was,
Lo here Dan Cuckoo my stern enemy
Claiming my right with proud authority,
Who this same blissful place as death did shun,
When as my dame in these same woods did won.
(O) how it (...) me, that a bird so base
Pandions princely daughter should disgrace,
Who by condition of his quality
Unto the world discries his basta^die:
Is It not enough, that once I being a dame
Y borne o^ ancient Kings of worthy fame,
Now live a bird loathing man's company
In desert woods for love to chastity,
And in the echoing mountains loudly sing
Phoebes chaste song, when as the lusty spring
Stirs up young bloods, that with my chaster lays
I may recall them from their wanton ways?
But must a bird the basest of the crew
In all the woodstand up to wrest my due
Unto his lot, which Phoebe did ordain
Should unto me for evermore remain?
Nor is it yet enough alas, that I
From stately palaces of kings do fly,
Still dreading Tereus loathsome luxury
To live in woods far from all company?
But must another Tereus seek t'expell
From woods likewise the forlorn Philo^el?
Alas if so, where shall I hide my head,
Where shall I shun th'ineuitable dread
Of bloody Tereus hot lust-sparkling face,
If nor in woods, nor house I shall have place?
To you therefore (fair Nymphs) to your just doom
That as the vmpiers of my cause are come
I do appeal, not doubting but the love
You bear to Phoebes name your hearts will move
In this so just a cause to pity me,
That was as dear to her as dear might be;
Which if ye do, your fame shall never die
And Castas self shall sing your praise on hie.
This said, she breathed from her breast so clear
The sweetest lays, that ear did ever hear,
To which all other birds about the place
Did tune their diverse notes to do her grace,
As in approuance of her worth to sing
As chief in woods to welcome in the spring,
Which did so daunt Dan Cuckowes daring pride,
That of the thought his shameful head to hide:
But knowing well that he had friends in place
That of those partial Nymphs had got him grace,
Fear set aside, and his obeisance made,
Unto those Nymphs these words he boldly said:
(Ye glorious offspring of great honors bed,
Virtues fair^ impes, mirrors of womanhed,
Bright Angel-like sweet Nymphs, whose beauties blaze
Adornes the world like Tytans golded rays)
Vouchsafe with gentle patience for a space
Your gracious silence, while I plead my case.
The jar begun b^twixt my foe and me,
The subject of my purps'd speech should be;
But first both words and wit, I must apply
To make an answer to mine enemy.
Though of my birth no boaster I will be
Seeing in this cause it naught avails me;
Yet, that I may, that scandalisme refute,
Which my ^al^e foe does unto me impute,
Know that Jove's bird, the Eagle prince of air
Did foster me being young with tender care,
In whose proud neasty built, in Iouiall tree
My dame by secret stelth conveyed me.
In that same clime, where AEstas sits in pride
Beneath the tropic of hot summers guide,
The crabbed Cancer, where in earthes cool cells,
The hot sun painted people ever dwells,
Not far from whence great Nilus evermore
With fruitful waves does wash The Egyptian shore,
There was I bred, and there my fame first grew,
Which thence long since about the wide world flew.
For South from thence the land of Cyprus lies,
Whereas the people use to sacrifice
To lo^es fair Queen, of whom I won great grace,
When she was wroth with people o^ that place:
For once being sore offended with them all
And musing with he^selfe, what plague should fall
Upon their heads, she chaunc'd to cast he^ eye
Upon an home, which she did soon apply
Unto their brows, whereby they straight forsook
Their former shape, and Oxe-like was their look:
But they blind buzzards could not see the same,
Whereby the lesser was their grief and shame,
Till ore their goodly heads, I wau'd my wing
And cuckoo in their ears aloud did sing;
Which when they heard, like raging Bulls they bore
Their lo^tie heads, and with loud bellowing rore
Did show their jealous thoughts: for which men say
They called are Cerastes to this day:
And for this fact of mine the Cyprian dame,
The Queen of love did give to me for name
The song, which I did sing and did decree,
That I thence forth her only bird should be;
She bore me to that garden of great fame,
Which yet of her Adonis bears the name,
Where she her self did teach me how to sing,
Her sweet delights unto the youthful spring;
And did appoint, that the years youthly prime
Should be the season of my singing time:
For well she knew, that season did belong
Unto the nature of my pleasant song;
As for my foe, although her lays be sweet:
Yet be they sad patheticall unmeet
To be recorded, when the lusty spring
Tidings of pleasure to the world does bring,
More fit with little Redbrest on a thorn
To bear a part, and help her for to mourn
For loss of summer, when cold winters breath
To all our pleasures threatens hateful death:
Then (gentle dames, great Ladies of delight)
Who in this bower of bliss both day and night
have your abode, where winter never lowres
N^ on your heads powers down his stormy shewers;
Let it be seen that ye have need of none
The summer past in winter to bemone:
So s^all Dan Cuckoo sing your lasting praise
Before loves Queen in his delightful lays.
This said, he chaunted out his Cuckows song,
Which laughter bred among'st the thickest throng,
Nor any pretty bird about the place
Would in their song vouchsafe to do him grace.
But see the chance the Nymphs being in a pause
And in consult how to decide this cause,
And each one being hushed with greedy ear
To hear that sentence, which they least did fear,
Of all the Nymphs up stood the chiefest dame
And thus this unjust sentence did proclaim:
(O all ye singers of the woods sweet quier)
Hear now the doom, which ye did long desire,
And (ye) twixt whom the jar begun but late,
As yet hangs in suspense without debate,
Know that each others cause does now abide
In equal balance, which we thus decide.
Seeing to the nature of each others song,
Two parts of all the year seem to belong,
That part in equal doom we will ordain,
Which is most meet for either of you twain;
First touching Philomel, seeing that her dittie
Is always passionate and moving pity,
Seeing with her, when she sings in wo^ull wise
The echoing mountains seem to sympathize,
And rocks do weep, and trees do seem to groan,
When in lamenting lays she list to moan
In that sad time, when Boreas winged scouts
Locks up the fruitful Terras water spouts,
And with congealing puffes do crystalize
The cloud-like waves of Neptunes liquid skies;
Let Philomel in her pathetike strain
For summers loss in leauelesse woods complain,
Lest, when her doleful ditties she does sing
She do disturb the pleasance of our spring:
But for Dan Cuckoo seeing he never sings,
But when sweet Zephirus on gentle wings,
Breathing good morrowes to the fair Aurora,
Begins each day to kiss his wanton Flora;
We think it meet, that he be chief to sing,
Where ere he meets the Lady of the spring.
And seeing, when earth has lost her flowring May
He cannot sing for grief of her decay,
Here let him stay, where he may ever sing
Seeing here with us we have eternal spring.
This is our doom and thus we do debate
The cause betwixt Dan Cuckoo and his mate.
Thus having said, she ceast, and thereupon
Such murmur, as we hear in woods, that groan,
When winds roused up through hollow grounds do break,
Such noise was heard amongst those, that heard her speak;
And all the quier of birds about the place
Did droope and hang the head, for such disgrace
To wronged Philomel, and for her sake,
A mournful melody did seem to make:
But what alas auailes their discontent,
Those partial judges rose, and with them went
Dan Cuckoo singing his triumphant song,
While Philomel bewailes her helpelesle wrong,
Who being unjustly robbed of her right
And from the bower of bliss exiled quite,
Calling to mind, how that she once had been
The happy daughter of a King and Queen,
And since that she in shape of bird did live,
What honor Phoebes self to her did give,
Now from all future hope being quite cast down,
Overcome with grief, she fell in sudden swoune,
And groueling in the dust on her sad breast,
With deadly sorrow being sore oppressed,
Poor bird she hung the wing and gasp'd for breath
Seeming to yield unto the panges of death;
To whom her sister Progne standing by
With speed to her recovery did fly,
And houering over her, made pitious plaint
For to revive her, that began to faint,
Dead was her heart, to see her sister lie
In such a trance and often wish'^ to die,
She strock't her temples with her pretty beak
And raising up her limbs, that were so weak,
With gentle touch did feel each tender part,
And strove to strengthen her now dying heart:
Unto her aid the gentle Redbrest came,
The Wren, and fruitful Titmouse, that stern dame,
Who did apply their help at need so well,
That now the slitting life of Philomel
Half conquered with cold death, did make retreat
Unto the heart, the house of native heat;
Which, when her sister Progne did epsy
These words of comfort, she did soon apply;
(Ay me) quoth she, (dear sister) thou that art
Now made the image of impatient smart,
Why do thou not in these sad passions show
Thy wonted patience in afflicting woe,
And to our counsel lend thy listening ear,
The which may teach thee patiently to bear
This rufull sorrow, which does stop thy breath
And seeks to hasten thy untimely death;
Speak (o dear sister) speak, and tell us why
Thy soul with grief oppressed should seek to die.
She having said, the woeful Philomel,
Whose sad soul all this while in trance did dwell,
Did lift up th'heauie windows of her eyes
And spoke these rufull words in woeful wise.
Tempestuous chance her utmost spite has spent,
And at me wretch her utmost dart has sent,
Nor any plague is left, that she can tell,
With which t'oppresse the fo^lorne Philomel.
For since the time, that I, as well you know
Was, (woe alas that now I am not so)
Pandions daughter in my virgins state,
I have endured stern fortunes utmost hate;
Can I forget my Thracian slavery
Beneath false Tereus lustful villainy,
Or cease to think upon my virgins rape,
With loss of tongue and Ladies lovely shape?
Yea can I live and leave to have in mind
Fortunes last wrong, not least, but most unkind,
Those Nymphs late doom, I mean, by whose decree
A forlorn outcast I shall ever be?
For from Dan Cuckowes song my shame does spring
And where alas, will not Dan Cuckoo sing?
Since then, to me poor wretch by cru^ll fate
Naught else is left of former princely state?
But shame and ^oe, why do I longer feed
On loathed light, which woe afresh will breed?
This said, she suncke again in deadly swound:
But Progne quickly raised her up from ground,
Thrice did she sincke as dead, and thrice again
Did Progne raise her up with busy pain;
At last, when life her settled place did take
To comfort her, the little Wren thus spoke:
Now certes madame Philomel, quoth she,
You have great cause of plaint we all do see,
The which I ween would pierce the stoutest heart
And launch the boldest breast with bleeding smart;
Yet comfort to you take, and do not you
Let passions rage rob reason of her due;
Think with your self, as now too true it is,
That in this pleasant place, this bower of bliss,
Since that Dan Cuckoo finds entertain,
For us no certain safety does remain:
For well we see the Nymphs of this same place
Have given over that same wonted chase
Of harmefull beasts, which Phoebe did delight
Following strange game with greedy appetite,
Yea it is reported many Satyrs rude
Into their company themselves intrude,
By whose inticement you they did forsake
In their false doom Dan Cuckowes part to take:
Then do not grieve at this their unjust doom,
Ne think your self disgraced as overcome
Before such dames; for grace it seems to me
To be disgraced of those, that graceless be:
But swage your grief in this so ruefull case,
And go with us unto our dwelling place,
Where though alone in desert place it be;
Yet there from fear of foes you shall be free:
For as dame Titmouse and Redbrest can tell
Dan Cuckoo seldom sings, where we do dwell,
True, (neighbor Wren) the Redbrest did reply,
We live in safety, though in penury;
And if dame Philomel with us will go,
Such kindness as poor Robbins bower can show
She shall command, and though in that same wood,
None of the courtly birds have their abode;
Yet there do many gentle singers dwell,
That will be loving unto Philomel.
Yea; quoth the Titmouse, neither shall she there
Of proud Dan Cuckowes thieatnings stand in fear.
For all birds there his bastard note abhors
And evermore do make him deadly wars,
Twice six stout sons, at this same very hour
I have now living in my little bower,
All which shall serve the wronged Philomel
Against Dan Cuckoo, if with us she dwell:
Thus did these birds with gentle speech assay
Sad Philomelaes grief to drive away;
But long it was, ere sorrow would depart,
It was so deeply settled in her heart:
Yet at the length the Swallow, Progne hight
Did so persuade her, that she took her ^light
With little Titmouse, Robbin and the When
To desert woods far from th'abodes of men:
But Prognes self returned back again
To Trinobant, where (...) still ^emaine:
Thu^ from the ^ower o^ (...) ^as Philomel
Exiled for (...) i^ (...) woods to dwell
While there D^n Cuckoo as (...) bird did sing
To tell the pleasures of the youthful spring:
The mansion house, in which poor Philomel,
Did with her new companions daily dwell,
Was in a rock, whose head it self did shroud
In mistie cloak of many a wandering cloud,
And whose thick mossie sides and hollow womb
To many a bird did yield much building room,
It seated was down in a valley low,
Where many a silver gliding stream did flow,
And leauie woods in arbor wise did stand,
As made by art, and not by natures hand.
From right side of this rock, there issued out
A crystal spring which slowed round about
The bottom of the rock, whose upper brim
Thick set with herbs and flowers smelt sweet and trim:
In th'hollow of this rock the humming swarms
Of honey flies, whose bodies nature arms
With biting stings did bear a murmuring base
unto the spring, that trickling down apace
From of the rock did meanly seem to warbble
Among'st the pibble stones unto the trebble,
Which many pretty birds did seem to sing,
Houering about the rock with painted wing:
This was the place of Philomels abode
With her companions in the desert wood,
Where all the time of those long lasting hours,
When as the heavenly crab with his eight oars
Does in the starrie Zodiac softly row,
Felicity did in abundance flow,
Whereby fair Philomel did find no miss
Of wonted pleasure in the bower of bliss:
For there where curious art her help denide,
There natures self, that want with store supplide:
If Boreas did at any time offend her
The hollow rock a remedy did lend her:
If Phoe^us hurt her with his fiery rays,
She found redress beneath the leauie spraies,
To whose cool shades she safely might retreat,
When earth did crack beneath heavens burning heat:
If she did hunger after wonted bait,
The goodly fruit of every tree did wait
Upon her will: yea much variety
Of painted ^lies for her sati^tie
At hand in this her dwelling place she found,
So fruitful was this pleasant plot of ground:
If she did thirst, or heat did her annoy,
What pleasure did she take, what gladsome joy
Unto the silver gliding stream to ^lie,
That rolled through the bordering wood fast by:
For when she stooping steeped her tender beak
Into the wave, it often would seem to break,
And feeling her soft bosom pant and beat
Would bid her bath and quench her boiling heat:
Mean time flowers seemed to laugh and buds to spring,
Trees seemed to bloome and blossoms sorth to bring,
And winds to cool the scorching of the sun,
While by the brinke the current smooth did run,
Which often did please this pretty bird so well,
That in that place she still desired to dwell.
But long alas, thi^ pleasure did not last;
For long it was not, ere the earth defaced
By winters sad approach was forced to leave
That pomp, which from the spring she did receive;
For what thing is it subelementarie,
That still continues and does never vary?
What thing retains one form that ever lives
And place unto another never gives?
Alas, naught permanent with us does stay:
For end and offspring have successiue sway:
Eternal time, that ancient enemy
To vading natures prodigality
Remorselesse of all things with Sith cuts down
The growing glory of this earthes renown;
And as he flies with swift wings to and fro
By his decree, all things do come and go.
And so at length, where Philomel did dwell
Sad winter came, and summer bad farewell.
With cold th'ayres lower region began to shiuer
And daily to the earth did down deliver
The fleece-like yuorie flakes of heavenly snow,
Which from the neighbor region fast did flow:
For then from heavens point perpendicular
Hyperion in his sphere o^bicular
Running his wonted race with oblique course,
His repercusse beams beat with lesser force
Upon his butt, the ball of earth, whereby
A weak reflection, to our air did fly:
Then did the fruitful earth begin to faint,
When that warm wonted comfort it did want,
Which from the gentle breathing air should come,
To cherish up the fruit of her big womb,
Whose sorrows wrathful winter to augment
Did muster up his forces with intent
To spoil her daughter sweet Pomonaes loves
With her Autumnus in the shadie groves,
Whom to withstand bold Auster, that brave Knight
Joined ^orces with Autumnus for the fight,
And oftentimes brau'd Boreas in the field
Pomonaes ^uits from his proud blasts to shield:
But raging Hyems to enforce the war
All his bold Legions did revoke from far,
Which in three battles he did thus divide
To quell stout Auster and Autumnus pride,
The hidio^s storms, that beat down brazen walls
And horrid tempests that make tennis bals
Of mighty mountains in the vauntgard went
To give the onset with bold hardiment,
Who^e stubborn ranks with haileshot did abound
And drifts of snow their foe-men to confound,
Whom lusty Bore^s full of daunting dread
Did unto boisterous battle boldly lead:
The middle ward, great Hyems self did guide,
Who to the field like great god Mars did ^ide:
For on a winged cloud he sat on high
Decked in strange armor dreadful to the ei^,
Upon his breast a curac^ he did bear
Ofycie metal made, which far more clear
Then crystal shone: for like the c^ystall sky
It could subdue the gazers greedy eye,
Thereby his blade did hang in snow-white sheath,
With which he used t'imploy works of cold death
Mong'st those, that needy were, and could not arm
themselves to sh^n the stroke of his strong arm,
His y^ie Helmet powdered with white snow
Great terror and bright glory both did show,
And in the stead of plume stood thereupon
A bunch ofysacles by nature grown;
Which with pure snow being sprinkled (...)
Did seem to dance and leap for iollitie:
His shield, which at his back parts he did settle,
Was neatly framed of Diamondlike mettell,
Hewn out ofycie rocks in Scythian land
By nature wrought, and not by Artists hand,
On which for badge did stand in ramping p^ide
Cold Capricorn the shiue^ing winters guide.
In such like arms was wrathful Hyems clad,
Whose looks a terror to his arms did add:
His brows contract above his gloomie eyes,
On which the hoarie hear^s did bristled ^ise,
And Ioue-like look with grim stiff buggle beard
Made his own powers, that marched by him, affeard,
To gu^rd his person round about him stood
Whole hoastes of mists and many a roaring ^loud*
And thus to field the second battle went
Under conduct of Hyems regiment.
The third Battalion to the field did go
Beneath great Eurus standard against the foe,
Who being Lord of th'Easterne parts, that lie,
Where great Apollo first does mount the sky:
Many bold bands of soldiers brought from far;
To serve the mighty Hyems in this war;
In service with him for light horsemen came,
Those light swift winged winds, that bear the name
Of Boreas and of Eurus both; for whom
To serve in these same wars they all were come,
With these th'humerous vapors joined their powers
The gloomie fogs, and duskie drizeling showers,
Whole troops of drowzie mistes, of dew and frost,
Who of themselves could make a mighty h^ast*
And thus did Hyems his whole powers divide,
Which winged were with clouds on either side;
Of whose approach when Autumn first did hear,
His heart stroke dead, began to faint for fear:
Yet calling mighty Auster to his aid
And gentle Zephirus, his part he made,
As able as he could, and boldly went
To frustrate winter of his proud intent;
Unto his aid the King of forests all
Came backed with his consorts, whom some do call
The tree of Jove, with whom there came from far
Fields, forests, woods, and groves unto this war:
Thus did both parts prepare with all their might
To meet each other in the appointed fight.
The time being come, before the fight b^gan
Down from the hills the torrents swiftly ran,
As scouts from Hyems camp to take survey
Of Autumnes host, that in the valleys lay,
Which all the birds about both near and far
Took as a warning of th'approching war,
And for themselves provided all in have
Until the danger of the war were past:
Mong'st whom the little Redbrest with great care
Of Philomel her friend did make repair
Unto the rock, where she and Philomel
This dangerous time might both in safety dwell:
Then came proud Hyems forward to the ^ight
Down from the ayrie mountains that are pight
In th'articke side, whereas the Dragons train
Diuides the wrathful bears by Charles his waine:
The battles joined, and both the hosts did meet,
Where lusty Auster cuffe for cuffe did ^reet
The migh^ie Boreas self, whose very breath
Did powder-like blast other foes to death:
Then came the storms and tempests to the fight
In black, fresh, gloomie horror all bedight,
With smouldering fume, thick driftes of drizeling rain,
Commixt with haileshot, ^ull of deadly bane,
Who at the first their foes did soon confound,
Rending up woods and forests from the ground,
Whose leauie heads dispersed about did fly,
Tossed to and fro, like ^eathers in the sky:
Then to the reskew with the western King
Mild Zephirus, came Autumn, who did bring
Many swift winged winds, who with great might
At first in counter did renew the fight:
For many iustling clouds, that came in course
With bold intent to bear their violent force
Being hemmed in round about, could not abide,
But deadly wounded were on every side,
Who fearing in their cloudie shapes to die
In humerous thin drops away did fly:
But now to gain the glo^ie of the day,
Lo, Eurus came, who at his first assay
By violent force did end the doubtful fight
And turned his foes into inglorious flight.
Mean time, great Autumn took his love aside,
His fair Pomonas self, whom he did hide
In wooden walls of forests, woods and groves,
From mighty Hyems false inueigling loves,
While he with Zephirus and Auster flew
To Tytans Western house, there to renew
Their powers against Aries should the year recall
To free Pomona from great Hyems thrall:
Mean time great winter in triumphant wise
Over his captive foes did tyrannize,
The silver brooks that sweetly wound about
The pleasant banks with wreathings in and out,
With Adamantine-like strong ycie bands,
He fast did bind within the hollow lands:
The Crystal springs, that from the mountains side
With pleasing sound to ground did gently glide
And brackish streams, that gushed from the rock
With strong congealed frost he up did lock:
The slowring fields, woods, hills and mountains green
And valleys, that before to laugh were seen,
In stead of fresh green color, now were clad
In h^arie hue, that made them look full sad;
Yea every thing, for want of heat half dead
In winters (...), droop't and hung the head:
Yet all this time of winters wrathful reign,
When all things did in deep distress complain,
Dan Cuckoo in the bower of bliss did sing
His joyful note, where dwells eternal spring:
Where, while that he did live both day and night
Drencht in the dainty dregs of deep delight,
With little Redbrest forlorn Philomel
In hollow rock in consolate did dwell,
Where she poor bird in many a doleful strain
The Nymphs late unjust doom did much complain,
Which was the cause of all her misery,
That lived before in chief felicity.
The state, which fortune erst to her did give
Compared to this, in which she now did live,
Did trebble sorrow on her dying heart
A fresh reviving her forgotten smart,
For misery to those most bitter is,
That tasted once the sweets of happy bliss,
Which little Redbrest did perceive right well
In her companion gentle Philomel:
For once when Philomel and she together
In hollow rock sat shrouded from the weather
Still as the Redbrest in sweet notes did sing
A sad complaint for absence of the spring,
So did poor Philomel her grief to show
In sad record recount her former woe:
To whom the Redbrest moved with melting pity
To hear the sad tunes of her doleful dittie,
These words of comfort spoke: (sister) quoth she,
I see that winters blasts dispeasant be,
And in your thoughts renewes the memory
Of your precedent lives felicity,
Whereby I know, your sorrow is the more,
That hapless now lived happy heretofore:
But now unto my words your listening lend,
By which perhaps your sorrows may have end:
Each year, when winter cause of all our woe,
Upon these woods with cold keen breath does blow,
From hence compeld I usually do fly,
To famous Trynobantum, here fast by,
Whereas your sister Progne builds her bowers,
Safe from the threats of winters stormy showers,
For heaven that here looks grim with gloomie face
With mild aspect beholds that happy place,
There, not as here the inhabitants do know
Cold winters rage, nor does proud Bore^ blow
So sharp and keen: but in the welkin fair
The milder winds do toss the gentle air;
There also many gentle Nymphs do dwell,
That may compare with those that do excel
In beauty bright; for eye did never see
More fair then in great Trynobantum be,
To whom I do not doubt, if that we go,
But they to Philomel will favor show,
And though those Nymphs, that in the bower of bliss
Have their abode, against thee have done amiss:
Yet they no doubt will pity thy complaint
And drive Dan Cuckoo from great Trynobant;
And in our way, as we together sly
Lest we be destitute of company,
In this our journey with us well I know
Our neighbors Titmouse and dame Wren will go:
Then be not sad, help never comes too late,
And time perhaps may turn your froward fate.
This said, sad Philomel no answer made
But making doubt of that, which Redbrest said,
Sometimes she thought it best to live content
In th'hollow rock all danger to prevent:
But when proud Boreas blasts her heart did daunt,
She thought it best to fly to Trynobant.
Thus diverse doubts did in her thoughts arise,
Nor what was best to do could she devise,
Until her neighbors Wren and Titmouse came,
Who with perswasiue speech her mind did frame
To Trynobant with them along to go,
Unto the fair Nymphs there, her cause to show,
To try if they for Castaes sake would chase
The unchaste Cuckoo from their dwelling place:
Thus by persuasion of those pretty birds,
The gentle Philomela soon accords
To go with them, though, as it came to pass,
The sequel proved their labor fruitless was.
For in their journey lo, as they did flee,
Taking their covert slight from tree to tree,
Not daring to be seen in open sky,
About great Trynobant they did epsy
The swift-wing'd swallow making her strong flight,
Sister to Philomela, Progne hight;
To whom right glad they took their ready way
Each one recording her deligh^some lay,
Which did so loudly echo in the air,
That Progne heard it, as they came from far,
And drawing nie to know what it might be
Staying her swift strong flight lo, she did see
Her sister Philomel with other birds,
To whom with wonderment she spoke these words;
(O heavens) what chance is this, what see I here
Pandions Philomel, my sister dear?
Alas, what sad mishap is now befell,
That you have left the place where you did dwell,
Great peril, which I wot you little know,
In coming hither, you do undergo.
Sister, (said Philomel) no great mischaunce
Has happened unto me, nor ignorance
Of peril in the way has made me bold:
But forced by stormy winters bitter cold.
My friends and I have lately left our home
And for relief to Trynobant a^e come,
Where you do live in chief felicity,
Free from the thrall of winters tyranny.
Alas, (good sister) Progne did reply,
Let not that vain opinion in your eye
Go current, which the idiot multitude
Out of blind ignorance does still conclude,
That mean estate is greatest misery
And high esteem the chief felicity:
For high or low, rich are not rich indeed,
And great states still on discontent do feed.
What dreadful danger dogs him at the heel,
That proudly vaunts on top of Fortunes wheel?
What daunting dread his Stealing steps attend,
Whose climing thoughts do aim at honors end?
Who fears to fall, but he that sits on high,
Or feels the infection of an envious eye?
For envy evermore her poison spits
At those, that most in fortunes favor sits,
The heavy care, that wounds the mind with woe
Seldom forsakes the giddie feet that go,
Where treades the steps of high authority,
So fleeting is this earthes felicity:
For wavering chance about him still does fly,
That proudly seeks to build his hopes on high,
Of which a president, I well may be
Unto you all, such is my chance you see:
For fate and nature having both decreed,
That I in lofty tops of towers should breed,
While you my happy sister Philomel
Should in the woods and forests safely dwell,
About the bower of bliss once did not I,
A long time safely build my bowers on high,
Till by my foes, they all were overthrown
And young ones slain, which I shall ever moan:
For those false Nymphs which sentence gave against thee
On proud Dan Cuckowes side, did all agree,
Because beneath the windows of their towers
My custom was to build my secret bowers,
That I for ever should be chased thence
To seek my fortunes though for no offense:
For lo no crime against me they could object,
But that because, they said I did detect
Their chamber sports, and truth to say mine eye
Such obscene sports did often times there epsy,
That very shame bids me forbear to tell
The nuptial band-breake play, that there befell:
Wherefore from thence long since they did me chase,
Since when I lived have in this same place,
Whereas you say, I build my lowly bowers
Safe from the threats of winters stormy showers:
Yet in such fear of those, that use to feed
On beauties spoil, about whose bowers I breed:
That would my fate had been to live alone
In forests wide, though winter made me moan.
She having said, this answer Redbrest made:
Certes (dame Progne) you have wisely said,
For better it is to live we all agree
In mean estate content, from danger free,
Then in the blind worlds deemed felicity
In trouble, care and minds perplexity;
But we to Trynobant not only come,
For that we grieve at winters blasts at home:
But seeing many a bright cheek'd gentle dame
Dwells here in Trynobant we hither came,
That so thy sister Philomel might try,
If they for love to honored chastity
Would drive Dan Cuckoo from this place with shame
And raise again sad Castaes dying name.
To this thus Progne did return reply.
Alas (good Redbrest) thy frail shallow eye
Naught but th'externall species does behold,
Deeming all things that gl^ster perfect gold:
Each winter, when thou ^ither do repair
Our Nymphs being spree^ly vigorous and fair,
Thou deem'st their minds to be as wise and witty,
As in proportion, they be ^aire and pretty:
But thou art blind; for do but mark with me
Their witless actions, and thou soon shall see
Their fair but foul; their wit, but wanton will,
Their wisdoms quintessence loves idle skill,
For here in Trynobant with their consent
Dan Cuckoo sings his lays with meriment,
Venus no more on Ida hills is seen,
In Paphos temples, nor Cytheron green:
But long ago has bid them all farewell
Here in great Trynobant with us to dwell:
For here the lusty Queen of love adornes
The poor Cer^stes with the welked horns,
Here the Propoetides deuoid of sense,
Those women pictures of true impudence,
By the great power of loves luxurious Queen
Are turned to stones, women no more are seen.
For which Pigmalion leads a single life
And fears strange things, not daring weda wife.
She (...) spoken, all the other birds
Long sil^nt stood amazed at those her words
Till I it mouse spoke, quoth she, what you do tell
Is very ^range and we perceive right well,
That gentle Casta here shall find small (...),
Seeing such strange Nymphs do d^ll in this same place:
But what does cause them with such impudence
In spite of modesties pure excellence,
So much degenerate from heavenly kind?
Sure pinching want does much oppress the mind:
Or el^e with Danae for love of g^ld
They kindly suffer friends to be too bold.
No certes (Titmouse) Progne did repli^,
Nor love of gold, nor pinching penury:
But plenty, pleasure, ease and idleness,
Is cause of their dear deemed voluptuousnes,
Whereby they often times rather give then take
The golden gifts, that minds immodest make,
Here need not love come take a sleepelesse nap
With golden showers in Danaes lovely lap.
For here our lusty Danaes, if he want
Will shower down gold on him, if he but grant:
In nights black veil, he need not hide his head
If he intend to got' Amphytrions bed,
For the Alcumenaes here both day and night
Will meet him any where for loves delight,
If Daphne here do run, she slackes her pace
Till Phoebus catch her, whom she must embrace,
And here if lovely Syrinx do intend
To run from rugged Pan: yet in the end
She seeming faint her swifter course will stay,
That she may be the pipe, when Pan does play:
For neither Pans high horns nor rugged beard
Can make the Nymphs in this same place affeard.
Fie, fie (dame Progne) quoth the little Wren,
In sooth against them, thou have too bitter been,
I do not think that such incontinence
Can lurk beneath the glorious excellence
Of such rare beauty, which does seem t'exce^
In these fair dames, that in this place do dwell;
Yet if in them such light demeanor be,
Doubtless they do not make it known to thee,
How then can thou such things, as these relate
With their close deeds not being intimate?
Progne replied; unwisely have you said
Me with untruth vngentlie to vpbraid;
For know dame Wren, that what I late did show
Is nothing in respect of that I know:
For in my neast built wondrous by my wit
Beneath their chamber-windowes I do sit,
Where if your self were present but one day,
You would speak more then lately I did say.
For there often times I do both see and hear
Those things that shame to tell bids me forbear.
This said, the other birds all silent sat
As modestly for bearing, t'aske of that
Which Prognes self did seem half shamed to tell,
Until at last spoke gentle Philomel,
And said (dear sister) hide not what you know;
Because the thing breeds shame which thou shall show
For to the author of the sin be shame,
Not unto him, that is guiltless in the same,
Nor should examples of immodestie
Offend the modest ears of chastity,
For virtues glorious shine, then shines most bright,
When it is opposed to vice her opposite,
As whitest things seem fair^st to the eye,
When they be matched with black their contrary.
Wherefore (dearesister) speak and boldly tell
The shameless deeds of dames that here do dwell,
So shall we sing about the world so wide,
That which their chamber walls now seem to hide,
Of which perhaps when they hereafter hear
To do the like hence forth they will forbear.
She having said, thus Progne made reply:
If that ye will (yebirds) that I descrie
And draw the curtains of the unchaste bed,
Where Mars and Venus horns old Vulcans head,
Come near and listen, lest the obscene sound
Of my strange speech do in the air abound,
And in the same do breed corruption,
From whence may spring a foul infection
Of those hot furious, fiery, lustful beasts,
That toiled with lust, do loath loves vulgar feasts,
Whom nature cannot furnish with excess
In kind-like game: but that some monstrous mess
They do affect, I will not here speak much
Lest I offend; my meaning is of such
As imitate Romes Semiramida,
Or that Italian Cortigiana,
And put in practice thou art of Aretine,
At which both heaven and nature does repine,
And with that Lybian lustful foul Syrena,
That woman monster Dodecamechana
In Venus act devise twelve sundry measures
With lusty lads at full to take their pleasures;
Nor will I tell, though many be of these
That with Athlanta and Hyppomenes
Do Stalion-like run madding out of season
To quench their lust, against nature and against reason;
Nor here to show to you is my intent
That execrable squirtlike instrument,
Which lust burnt, fiery, female monsters use
In fruitless lust, to natures vile abuse:
For these are things not fitting speech of birds:
But best befitting roughest Salyrs words.
I only here intend to make report
Of that same common counted cuckoo sport,
Which by our dames is deemed a lawful game,
Though impudence it self blush at the same,
(I mean of the old Malbeccoes of our age)
Who justly bear Cornuted Vulcans badge.
In Trynobant as to and fro I fly
It has been oftentimes my chance t'espie
An old cold January iet before
A fresh young May, a spreetly Helinore,
Unequal both in years and in affection,
And also far unlike in their condition;
Yet to the blind-ey'd world it did appear,
That May did love her January dear;
Which I scarce trusting with a curious eye
Have closely trackt their steps the truth to try:
And lo, while he has set his thoughts upon
His horded heaps, his May being left alone,
He being close at his accounts above,
While she beneath sits longing after love,
In steps me March clad like a lusty Knight,
Or pleasant April full of sweet delight,
Who in loves wanton art, not wanting skill
Has slights enough t'assault fresh May at will;
But what needs long assault where none does shield;
For gentle heart she is as prone to yield,
As he t'assault, which well this younker knows,
Though seeming strange a while with her he gloss,
For by her touching, stroking, gentle pressing,
Her rubbing, wringing, wrestling, wanton thrusting,
Coy looking, culling and kind inte^taine
He finds enough and knows he^ meaning plain:
For gentle May no proffered time will lose,
When as from home old Ianuar^e goes,
And then the unchaste kisses common flies,
Which Hymen's strongest nuptial bands unties,
Then beauty sets the e^es of lust on fire,
And fancy breaks forth into strong desire,
And lastly lust does in a moment space
Make Ianuaries brows bud forth apace,
Which neither he, nor any else do (...),
Though it be commonly well known to me:
For these be objects common to my sight,
As in my bowers I sit, both day and night.
Then say ye birds, if in this place can dwell
My sister Casta gentle Philomel.
Ay me, quoth Philomel, the more my grief,
That I poor wretch can no where find relief:
For where alas, shall Casta find a place,
Where proud Dan Cuckoo sings not her disgrace?
Great Phoebes name is now extincted quite,
Whose fame whilom the golden stars did smite,
Where else are her fair Nymphs, whose beauties blaze
Did deck the world with like to Phoebus rays,
Who with the slower of heavenly chastity
Their beauties garland did so dignifie,
That Venus brat, though deemed a god of power,
With all his flames could never scorch their flower?
But now alas, fair Phoebes dainty rose,
Which many Nymphs did in their breasts enclose,
And with great care did tender it more dear,
Then dearest life, does no where now appear,
Else why does Casta suffer such disgrace,
While that the Cuckoo sings in every place.
As thus she spoke, not far they did epsy,
How proud Dan Cuckoo to and fro did fly,
Who vaunting in the air with outstretch'd wing
His bastard note triumphantly did sing;
At whom the Swallow, Robbin and the Wren,
And Titmouse, as if they enraged had been,
With eager thoughts did fly, whom they in chase
A long time did pursue from place to place,
Often did they flap him with their feathered quils,
And peckt and beat him with their tender bills,
Until from out of sight he quite was fled
And in some covert place had hid his head:
But they returning back, where making moan,
They late had left poor Philomel alone,
Lo, they beheld, how she poor bird did sit
Half dead with torment of her woeful fit,
To whom poor birds being moved with inelting pity
Each one did strive to tune her doleful dittie,
Long sat they sympathizing in their song
The woeful record of poor Castaes wrong,
Nor of sweet comfort could they ought partake,
Until at length the little Wren thus spoke:
(My loving friends and fellow birds) quoth she,
Great grief does vex your troubled thoughts I see:
But fond it is in sorrow still to dwell
And seek no means sad sorrow to expel:
For grief, that breeds despair, nere finds relief,
When good advice does master greatest grief;
Then know, that though no Nymph of this same place
Nor of the bower of bliss will take to grace,
The forlorn Casta, Phoebes only bird,
Yet meaner places may perchance afford
Some gentle dame, although of mean degree,
That unto Philomel would gracious be;
And well do I remember, in that place
There wonnes a virtuous Nymph of goodly grace;
Where I do safely build my lowly bowers
To shroud my self from winters stormy showers:
In humble cottage she does still remain,
The happy daughter of a country swain,
And though she live upon mean maintenance,
Yet with such grace and goodly governance,
She does demean her self, that many be
Of greater state, that want her genterie,
For little would ye ween, that such great grace
Had any lodging in so mean a place,
She has to wit hight Virgina to name,
Who though but mean, yet of exceeding fame:
For lo, that Squier, that lives in deep despair
Of gaining grace of Columbel the fair,
Unto an endless task by her being ti'd
To wander each where, through the world so wide,
To prove how many damsels he could find,
That chastely did retain a constant mind,
Did of three hundred dames find but this one,
That unto loves delight would not be won:
Then (gentle Philomel) lay by thy grief,
And of this dame let us go seek relief,
Upon whose bosom thou may sit and sing
The virgin beauty of her youthful spring,
Where proud Dan Cuckoo dares not come in place,
Much less dares sing his lays in thy disgrace.
The Wren thus having spoke, the other birds
With Castaes self did like well of her words,
And with the Wren would straight unto that wood,
Where that same virgin dame had her abode:
But gentle Progne she must stay behind,
As being forbidden by the fates unkind;
Since her in shape of bi^d they first did hide,
Nere to frequent the woods and forests wide;
Parting therefore from her with weeping e^es
Her sister Philomel spoke in this wise.
Sister (quoth she) the stubbome fates decree,
That from each other we must parted be:
For thou alas may not frequent the wood,
Nor may I come, where thou have thy abode:
For now (aye me) hard hap does me compel
Unto the bower of bliss, to bid farewell,
And unto Trynobant, where woe is me
My dearest sister thou shall live and see
My hateful foe, Dan Cuckoo proudly sing
In my dispight to welcome in the spring:
But must we then alas, for ever part,
The thought of which augments our woeful smart,
Must thus Pandions daughters bid farewell,
For ever in the world apart to dwell?
We must alas: wherefore compelled by fate,
Whose malice heaven it self may not abate,
Unto the world and thee I bid farewell
In desert woods for evermore to dwell.
Thus having said, both did with woeful heart
Each from the other heavily depart,
Sad Progne back to Trynobant did fly,
And gentle Philomel in company
Of little Redbrest, Titmouse and the Wren,
Did take her way far from the abodes of men
Unto that place, where dwelt that gentle dame,
Of whom the Wren did speak: where when she came,
Of that fair Nymph she found such intertaine,
That never more she thence returned again.
FINIS.
