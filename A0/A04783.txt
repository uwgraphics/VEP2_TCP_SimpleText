TO THE REDER
AFTER the executioun of Master John Kello minister of Spot (weilbelouit
reder) my purpois was not to have put in writ ye co^ fessioun of his horribill
offense, quhilk he maid upon the Scaffald, not lang befoir his sufferring, and
wald rather have wissit (for my awin part) the memory thereof to have been
buryit, than be any mannis industry and laubouris sa wickit exempill continuit
to ye posterity. For I was may assurit that his godly and vnfeynit
repentance* had sa blottit forth the memory of his offense from ye hartis of
all sic that sciris God, that my pen culd serve na thing towardis them, bot to
ingraft greter dolor and lamentatioun in their hartis. And as for the wickit I
did esylie persaif hair hartis sa obstinatly indurit aganis ye iudgementis of
God, that howsaeuer I write the treuth should be exponit be yame in contempt and
mockage. Quhilk thing albeit I was assurit of, it did I never suspect, that any
of the ungodly and enemeis of the treuth should sa far abandoun his awin
corruptit conscience, as to misreport the haill procedingis of this matter in
other Natiounis, and thereby to traduce the vndoutit treuth of Christis
Euangell. And thairsoir quhen it come to my knawledge yat sindrie of the
poysonit sect of the Antichrist, had not only writtin in other countries of yis
murder, keiping alwayis silence of his vnfeynit and ernist repentance, but
likewise by diverse lice^tious and ungodly Picturis laubourit to withdraw ye
simpill from Godis obedience, and Irreuerently spak of the seruandis of God. I
thocht it my dewtie to oppone myself unto their may ungodly and blasphemous
calumneis, and to intrert the matter planely as it was that yai to quhais eiris
the rumor of yis fact should cum micht be ye better informit to with stand the
wickitnes of them quhais principal cair is that God in his word may be
dishonorit. Nether do I sa write to this intent, that albeit his life had been
wickit, and continuit sa to the end, that the purity of Godis treuth culd have
been thairby defylit, na mair than ye traterous defectioun of Judas culd make ye
word of life unsavory to yame quha confessit Jesus to be the Sone of the
Everlasting God. Bot that every ane may understand, yat sic exempillis as they
abuse to mantene superstitioun seruis chiefly to the advancement of Godis
glory. For this wald I leirne at any of them, gif they be abill to make their
profit farther of this Tragedy, then Satan him self; quhais counsellis be his
godly repentance was confoundit, and ye pray quhilk he had in ane manner deuorit
be Godis prouyde^ce preseruit from his tyranny, gif God disapointit ye Father
of Iniquity, how can his children erect this baner to ye mantena^ce of his
Kingdom? Bot that the treuth may the mair evidently appeir, I will schortlie
comprehend the Confessioun quhilk he maid befoir his sufferring, in presence of
the haill pepill than ass nbillit ofter he had maid his prayer humbly to God

THE CONFESSIOVN OF Master Iohne Kello upon the Scaffald,
I DO not meruell in onv wayis to se sic ane multitude of pepill assembilit at
this presont, to behald the infortunat Tragedy of yis my wretchit life. For
the case is rair, and saving the good prouydence of God to be admyrit, and
wounderit, yat I being ye creature of God should have attemptit to remuif ye life
from them in quhome God had plantit his awin image: being ane husband should
unmercifully and besydis the Law of nature put hand in my awin flesh, bot
chiefly being ane Minister of Godis word, should haif sa far been caryit captive
be the temptatioun of the wickit Spreit, as to dishonor Godis treuth be my
horribill iniquity, and procure that the enemeis of the Euangel with oppin
mouthis should blaspheme Godis eternal verity. For I persaif at yis time
co^uenit an greit multitude, quhair of sum I dout not from the bottom of their
heart dois lament and beuail my estait, and callis to God ernestly to continue
the gift of repentance with me. Vtheris ar assembillit to gest and mok, not sa
mekill at me, as at ye Euangell, quhilk I (allace) ane unworthy Minister, hes
befoir preichit unto the pepill. And in deid, all prais alwayis appertening to
God, I was brocht up from my outh in exercise of leirning, and imployit my
mind sa diligently to the meditatiou^ of vertew, that I was not estemit in
the leist sort of them that did minister Godis word into this Realm. And
because my first ingres in the Kirk of God was vnfeynitly, and without
hypocresie to set forth his godly Name, I have that assurance in his mercyis,
that albeit he hes sufferit me to fall, it he sall not leif me destitute of
comfort in the end. Bot this I wald recommend unto every ane be my exempill,
that e mesure not the treuth of Godis word altogidder be the lyuis of sic as at
appoyntit Pastoris over ow. For they beir the self same flesh of corruptioun
that e do, and the mair godly ye charge is quhairinto they ar callit, the
reddyer is the enemy to draw them bak from Godis obedience. And the treuth
is, that I my self had not only the testimony of ane true preicher in the
countries quhair I did travel, bot lykwise of ane sinceir and vncorruptit
conuersatioun. Nether was their any of my vocatioun within this Realm of
Scotland that detestit mair from his heart, and publictly in ye chair of treuth
the abhominabill murtheris of Harie STEWART King of this land, and my Lord
Regent laitly murtherit, declaring out of the buik of God that the plaigis should
never ceis quhill the land war purgit, and the inue^teris, co^spyreris,
pertakeris, proponit ane publicte exempill of Godis seueir Iudgementis. Bot now
(allace) the committeris thereof will have me in their mouth for ane patroun.
Quhat meruell is it will they say yat ane vaik veschell, brocht up in plesuris,
had not ye feir of God befoir her eyis, quhen ane Minister not of smallest
reputatioun hes sa trespassit. Wald to God that as yai ar prompt, to speik of
my fall, so my repentance to God, and co^fessieun of my offense mycht sa
lyuelie tuich tham, that the appeirand vengeance of God be humiliatioun of
their hartis micht be remouit from this commoun wealth. For I wald that e should
understand, that I come not heir compellit be na men, nouther apprehendit be
the Justice, bot having perswatioun of freindis to saif my life in sum other
country, was rather willing to glorify God in my deith, then that my life
should be ane opprobrie and sclander to his treuth.

Bot now because I persaif my voce is not abill to streiche the self unto the
earis of the multitude heir conuenit, I will be content to leif ane schort
memorial aganis my self of my awin offense. For as concerning ye other quhair
of I am sclanderit, I tak God and his Angellis witnessis in ye contrary, yat
nouther had I any ingres in the wickit practices of the Magiciens, nouther was
farther curyous to understand tha^ God had manifestit in his word. Bot as
concerning the crime, I do not deny, bot may unnaturally I pat hands in her
quha at na time had geuin me any just cause of ofsence: for war it possibill,
yat ye course of my age micht be renewit, and ye time spent brocht bak agane,
yair is na flesh I wald rather choose to be associat with in marriage than her,
nouther did any other thing muif me to this wie kit interpryse, bot the
continual suggestioun of the wickit Sprite to advance my self farther, and
farther in ye world. And yat ow may persaif the ground of this matter, I had
first ane lytill portioun of money in my awin handis, quhilk I bestowit in
Lynlithgow upon profit, and did wickitly ressaif sum ganis and filthy ocker
thairby, ane thing (allace) over mekill vsit in this country. This manner of
deling, kendillit in me ane desire of avarice, quhilk the Apostill Paull not
without cause termit the ruit of all evil. And therefoir after a certane time
that I had bestowit in the town of Spot, I bocht ane portioun of land their,
for the quhilk I wedset landis at Lynlithgow and contractit farther det. Then
being disapoyntit of the ordinar prouysioun for preiching of the word, and not
weill intretie of them quhais dewtie was to half takin cair for me, I enterit
in ane meruellous perplexity of mind, and oppinnit ane reddy windo to the
temptatiounis of the enemy. For I ressonit with my self, yat being singill
without ane party I micht ye mair esylie spend my time.

And nixt, in case I wald marie thairefter I micht june my self with sic ane as
should have freindis in the country to mantene me in my possessioun, and procure
my farther advancement. Their was the glistering promisis quhair with Satan
after his accustomit manner, eludit my sensis, and preuaillit sa far in my
corruptit mind, that the space of forty day is togidder I did auait only
upon the opportunity of time to put my wickit desire in executioun. it sum
tymis having the commodity offerit, God straik sic terroris in my heart, that I
was not abill to perfurneis mine intent. Immediately thairefter I was vesyit
with seiknes, and greit disesis, quhilk I am assurit was the Messingeris of
God, to muif my heart to his obedience. But that quhilk should have seruit to
abstract my mind from the consauit impiety, I abusit may wickitly to bring
my purpois to effect. For under pretense of seiknes I labourit secreitly to
have takin her away be poysoun. And quhen I persauit that the cleinnes of her
stomok did reject that violence, I was alwayis preissit fordwart be the
temptatioun of the enemy, till I had performit that cruel fact with my handis
aganis her, quha in ye very deith culd not belief I buir her any evil will,
bot was glaid, as scho yan said, to depart, gif her deith culd do me outher
vantange or pleasure. Bot the farther I do remember of her the mair
intollerabill is ye burding of my displesure, quhilk notwithstanding I
laubourit by hypocrisy to have cullourit. For ane certane space besoir her
deith I did make my Testament, and thairin appoyntit her to have ye haill cair
of my geir and vpbringing of my children, that na man should suspect me to be
Author of that wickitnes quhilk I had consauit. And immediately befoir, did
spread abroad ane rumur of her that scho was temptit terribillie in the nicht,
that it micht thairefter appeir her self to have been the Author and murderer
of her awin self. Lykwise after I had stranglit her, I left ye keyis within
and eschapit by ane bak dur of my study, quhilk was not accustomit to be
oppinnit. And quhen ye bruit did arise that scho had murtherit her self, for ye
good oppinioun quhilk every ane had asweill of my doctrine and conuersatiou^,
maid na man to suspect my innocence, I did feyne my self only to be solist for
her saluatioun, and to dispute with yame that come to comfort me, quhidder it
war possibil yat scho quha had put handis in her self culd be under the
protectioun of God, and quhidder any man micht suppois that being under sa
terribill temptatioun scho culd anis sob for God is mercyis. And that my
effectioun to wardis her micht appeir the greiter, I did sa far abuse the lycht
of my awin conscience, as to deny in plane termis their was ane God quha
sufferrit sa innocent a creature gif place to the te^ptatioun and rage of
Satan. Quhilk thingis I passit about may craftily to conceil, it ye good
prouydence of God did be lytill and lytill bring all thing is to licht, and me
to that acknawledge of my awin offense, that I desire nathing mair under God
then to be separate fra the contagioun of this wickit flesche, in the quhilk I
have sa offendit God, and dishonourit his name. And in deid their was not small
support in the mouth of sum faithful brethrene to bring me to this Confessioun
of my awin offense. Bot abuif all, Master Andro Symsone Minister of Dunbar,
did sa lyuelie ripe forth the inwart cogitatiounis of mine heart, and discover
my mind sa planelie, that I perswadit my self God spak in him, and besydis
other Notabill coniecturis quhilk he trewly deducit befoir my eyis, he
rememberit me of ane dreime, quhilk in my greit seiknes did appeirandly present
the self. Brother (said he) I do remember quhen I vesyit ow in time of our
seiknes, e did oppin to me this visioun, that e war caryit be ane grym man
befoir the face of ane terribill Judge, and to eschaip his fury e did
precipitat our self in ane deip River, quhen his Angellis and messingeris did
follow ow with two edgit swordis. And ever quhe^ they struik at ow, e did
declyne and Iouk in the watter, quhill in the end be ane way unknown to ow e
did efchaip. This visioun I do sa interpreit, yat e ar the Author our self of
this cruel murder then consauit in our heart, and e ar caryit befoir ye
terribill Iudgmentis of God in our awin conscience quhilk now standis in Godis
presence to accuse ow, the Messingeris of God is the Justice of the country,
befoir the quhilk e fall be presentit, the watter quhairin e stuid, is that
vain Hypocrisy of our awin, and feyneit blaspheming of Godis Name, quhairby e
purpois to color our impiety, our delyuerance sall be spiritual. For albeit
e have vtherwyse deseruit, it god sall pull ow surth of the bandis of Satan,
and cause ow confess our offense to his glory, and confusioun of the enemy.
Nouther do e in any wise distruft in Godis promysis, for ow sall find na sin
almaist committit be ye reprobat, bot e sall find the children of God to have
fallin in the like. And it the same mercyis of God abydis ow, gif from our heart
e acknawledge our offense, and desyris at God pardoun. At this time did God mui
my heart to acknawledge the horror of mine awin offense, and how far Satan had
obtenit victory over me. But as the flesche is cairfull of the self, I
discursit within my awin heart quhat thing ratherest to do for my releif, of the
quhilkis two necessiteis occurrit, outher to abandoun this country, or to
remain. Gif I left the country and acceptit the deith upon me, I should leif in
perpetual terror, and have the mark of Cain upon me quhair sa ever I went,
besydis that I should leif ane perpetual infamy upon ye Kirk of God, quhair of
befoir I was comptit ane member albeit unworthy. So did I conclude to remain.
But heir had I the battle mair strong with my self. For I thocht to have
dissimulit my fact befoir the world. And did enter in this argument, that
sufficient it was to acknawledge my offense befoir God, nouther was it
necessair to publische my awin schame befoir men, and did sa flatter my self
with this reasoun quhill at last.

Quhat and I be presentit ^efoir ane Judge, quhair Confessioun of the treuth
sall be requyrit? Sall I not only leif in murder, bot help sin upon sin, and
conferme my dampnatioun with perjury? Sall the luif of this wretchit lyse sa
schuit the durris of my heart, that I sall never return vnfeyneitly toward is
my God? Sall I miserabill creature leif ane immor call sclander upon the Kirk
of God, for the quhilk Christ the Sone of God gaif his life? God forbid, and sa
did I conclude my self to make publict confessioun of my offense, and to present
me to ressaif punischement, quhilk ca^ not be sufficiently imaginit for my
deseruings. And in deid this far I do witness, that I was evidently trubillit
and disesit not only in mind, bot in body also, ever quhill I resoluit with my
self to tak this journey in hand. And sen ^yne I haif been at sic rest of
both, yat I am at quyetnes with God in my conscience. And hes sic strenth of
body as I had not this lang ^yme ago. Now brethrene, e have hard the
confessioun of my offense, and I desire every ^ne of ow that is Cristianis in
Gods name to forgif me of yat sclander quhilk I have raissit ^e my wickit
exempill. Especially ow, brethrene, quha ar callit to be preicheris of his
word, quhais doctrine and laubouris Satan had laubourit in me for to euert.
Bot praisit be God he is takin in his awin craft. And sa far do I traist in his
mercyis, that I sall be couth amang his elect, quhais namis ar writtin in the
buik of life. Desyring ow all to incall ernestty upon God to continue his
favor and grace with me to the end.

This being en dit, he prostrate him self upon his face, and maid sa godly a
prayer that maid every ane to murne. First confessing yat God was ane just
God, quha had reueillit his offense to the world, desyring lykwife that the
innocent murtheris co^mittit befoir micht be manifestit, and the land purgit
from blude. Nixt he confessit him to be ane God of mercy, quha wald not suffer
this blot to ly upon his Kirk, nouther him self in the end to be ouercum be
Satan. And thairfoir humbly desyrit for Christis saik to be ressauit in Godis
favor, that the deipnes of Godis gudnes micht be knawin to pas the haill
iniquity of man. And sa after constant Confessioun of Godis mercyis, and
incalling of his Name, he eildit the Sprite in the handis of our Savior, ye
fourt day of October. 1570.

FINIS.
