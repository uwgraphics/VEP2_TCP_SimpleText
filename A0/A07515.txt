LONDON. Printed by NICHOLAS OAKS. 1622.

TO The Honor of him, to whom the Noble Fraternity of Grocers, his Worthy
Brothers, have Dedicated their Loves, in costly Triumphs; the Right Honorable,
PETER PROBY, Lord Maur of this Renowned City.
TO be His Servant, that has served
Two Royal Princes, and deserved
So Worthily of Both; the Same
Call not Service, rather Fame.
At your Lordships Command: Tho. Middleton.

THE TRIVMPHS OF Honor and Virtue.
IF foreign Nations have been struck with Admiration at the Form, State,
and Splendour of some yearly Triumphs, wherein Art has been but faintly
imitated: There is fair hope that things where Invention flourishes, clear
Art and her graceful Proprieties, should receive favor and encouragement from
the content of the Spectator, which next to the service of his Honor and
honorable Society, is the principal reward it looks for; then not despairing
of that common favor, this takes delight to present it self.

And first, to begin with the worthy love of his Noble Fraternity, after his
Honors return from Westminster, having received some service upon the Water,
by the conduct of two Artfull Triumphs. Viz. The Throne of Virtue, and the
Continent of Jndia; which also by Land attends his Lordships most wished
arrival, accompanied with the whole body of the Triumph, which near upon the
time of his Honors approach are decently and distinctly placed; the first,
bearing the Title of the Continent of India: A triumph replenished with all
manner of Spice-plants, and trees bearing Odor, attends his Honors arrival in
Paul's Churchyard; A black Personage representing India, called for her
odours and riches, the Queen of Merchandise, challinging the most eminent
Seat, aduanceth her self upon a bed of Spices, attended by Indians in Antique
habits: Commerce, Adventure and Traffic, three habited like Merchants,
presenting to her view a bright Figure, bearing the inscription of Knowledge, a
Sun appearing above the trees in brightest splendour and glory: The black
Queen before mentioned, lending a voice to these following words:

The Speech.
YOu that have eyes of Judgment, and discerue
Things that the best of Man and Life concern,
Draw near, this black is but my native dye,
But view me with an Intellectual eye,
As Wise men shoot their beams forth, you will then find
A change in the complexion of the mind;
I Am beauteous in my blackness, O ye Sons
Of Fame and Honor, through my best part runs
A Spring of living Waters, clear and true,
Found first by Knowledge, which came first by you,
By you, and your examples, blessed Commerce,
That by Exchange settles such happiness,
Of Gummes and fragrant Spices, I confess
My Climate Heaven does with abundance bless,
And those you have from me, but what are they
Compared with Odours whose sent never decay,
And those I have from you, plants of your youth,
The Savor of eternal life sweet Truth,
Exceeding all the odoriferous sent,
That from the beds of Spices ever went:
I that command, (being prosp'rously possessed)
The Riches and the Sweetness of the East,
To that famed Mountain Taurus spreading forth
My balmy Arm, whose height does kiss the North,
And in the Sea Eoum laue this hand,
Account my blessings not in those to stand,
Though they be large and fruitful, but confess
All wealth cons;ists in Christian holiness,
To such caelestiall knowledge I was led;
By English Merchants first enlightened,
Jn Honor of whose memory, only Three
I instance here, all of this' Brotherhood free,
To whose Fames the great Honor of this hour
Aptly belongs, but to that Man of Power
The first and chiefest, to whose worth so clear,
Justice has given her Sword up for a year:
And as yo'n Sun his perfect splendour shows,
Cheering the Plants; and no Clouds interpose
His Radiant Comforts; so no Earthy part
Which makes Eclipses in a Rulers heart
(As in that glorious Planet) must come nigh
The Sun of Justice, all such mysts must fly;
You're in an Orb of Brightness placed and fixed,
And with no soil must Honor be commixt.
So to your worthy Progress Zeal commends
Your Lordship, with your Grave and Noble friends.
The Speech being ended, to add a little more help to the fainter
Apprehensions, the three Merchants placed in the Continent, have reference to
the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, all Three being this year Brothers of this
Ancient and Honorable Society, which triple or three fold Honor happened to this
Worthy Company in the year 1577. Sir Thomas Ramsey being then Lord Mayor, and
Master Nicholas Backhouse and Master Francis Bowyer, Sheriffs; having
cohereuce with this years Honor, matched and paralelled with these Three their
as worthy Successors, the right Honorable, Peter Proby, and the generous and
Nobly affected, Master John Hodges, and Sir Humphrey Handford Sheriffs and
Aldermen.

By this time his Lordship being gracefully conducted toward the Chariot of
Fame, which awaits his Honors approach near the little Conduit in Cheap;
Antiquity a grave and reverend Personage, with a golden Register-booke in his
hand, gives life to these words:

The Speech.
Objects of Years and Reverence greet mine eye,
A Sight most pleasing to Antiquity;
I never could unclasp this Book of Fame
Where Worthies dwell by a distinguished Name,
At a more comely season; I shall tell
Things sprung from Truth, near kin to Miracle;
With that of later days I first begin,
So back into the deeper Times again:
I only touch Thy memory (which I know
In thankfulness can never be found slow)
With Heavens miraculous Mercy, to Thy Health
After so long a Sickness, all the wealth
Which thou with an vnusuring hand have got
Which is not the least wonder worthy note,
(Truth makes me speak things freely) cannot be
A greater work then thy recovery,
Nine Brethren-Senators thy Seniors all
Whose times had been before thee, Death did call
To their eternal Peace, from this degree
Leaving their earthly Honor now to thee,
Think and be thankful still, this seems the more
Another observation kept in store,
For seventeen Senators since thy time were chose
And to this minute not one dead of those.
Those are not usual notes, nor here it ends,
The Court and City two most Noble Friends,
Have made exchange a late, I read, from hence
There has gone some most worthy Citizens
Up to the Courts advance; in lieu of that
You have a Courtier now your Magistrate,
A Servant to Elizabeth the blessed,
Since to K. James that reigns with Salomons breast.
Kept the Records for both, from the Queen took
Charge of three hundred Horse, three thousand Foot,
Four Attributes cleaues to this Man of Men,
A Scholar, Soldier, Courtier, Citizen,
These are no usual touches, to conclude
(Like to his life with blessings so endude)
Has chose his Brotherhood, men of that Fame
For Bounty, Amity and honored Name
The City bounds transcend not in their place,
And their word makes them prosper, God grant grace.
Honor they never wanted, when wa'st seen
But they had Senators to their Brethren
Nay, one record here to make joy more glad,
I find seventeen that were in Scarlet clad
All at one time of this Fraternity,
Now five, for this hours honor brings forth three,
Fame triple will make triple virtue strive
At whose triumphant Throne you next ariue.
For farther Illustration there are contained in Antiquities golden Legend, the
Names of many Worthies of ancient Time, by whom this Noble Fraternity has
received much honor, such as were the worthy and famous Sir Andrew Bockerell,
who was Lord Mayor of this City, the sixteenth year of King Henry the third,
and continued in the Magistracy seven years together, also the Noble Allen de
la Zouch, who for his good government in the time of his Maioralty, was by
King Henry the third, created both a Baron of this Realm, and Lord chief
Justice of England. Also that famous Worthy, Sir Thomas Knowles, twice Lord
Mayor of this honorable City, which said Sir Thomas began at his own charge
that famous building of Guild Hall in London, and other memorable works both
in the City and in his own Company, Reedifying also Saint Anthonies Church;
with many others that are fair Ornaments to Memory. Viz. Sir William Seuenock,
sir Robert Chichsley, sir Stephen Brown, sir Henry Keble, sir William Laxton,
etc. Who by those Virtues that they were most addicted unto in their lifetime,
are Illustrated by persons of Brightness in the Throne of Virtue, the next
part of Triumph that presents it self: next beneath Antiquity, sits
Authority, placed between Wisdom and Innocence, holding a naked Sword, a
Serpent woond about the Blade thereof, two Doves standing upon the cross Bar
of the Hilt, and two hands meeting at the Pummel, intimating Mercy and Justice,
accompanied with Magistracy, who holds in his hand a Key of gold, signifying
both the Key of Knowledge and of Confidence, the City Magistrate taking into
his trust the Custody of the Kings Chamber, the proper Title of the City; and
which Key of gold also stands in his Lordships Crest, viz. an Estridge holding
a Key of gold in his Mouth, his Neck circled with a golden Crown.

His Lordship by this time arriving at the Throne of Virtue, placed near Saint
Laurence-Lane end, Receives this greeting from her Deity.

The Speech.
I See great Power approach; here makes a Stand,
Would it with Virtue ought? for some Command
Seems so complete in Selfe-Opinions Eye,
It will scarce look on me, but passes by;
As if the Essence of my Deity
Were raised by Power, and not Power raised by me;
But let such Rulers know that so command
They build the Empire of their Hopes on Sand*
Still This remains, with Eye upon me fixed
As if he sought to have His splendors mixed
With these of mine, which makes Authority meek,
And I Am so ficke of Love to those that seek
I cannot choose but yield; nor does it wrong
Great Power to come to Virtue to be strong,
Being but a Woman, merciful and mild,
Therein is Heaven with greater glory stilde
That makes weak things, as Clemency, and Right,
Sway Power, which would else rule all by Might:
It maybe said you did but late pass by
Some part of Triumph that spoke Virtuously,
And one such Speech suffices; it is not so
In taking of your office, there you go
From Court to Court, before You be confirmed
In this high place, which Praetorship is termed;
From Virtue, if to Virtue you resort,
It is but the same course you have in Court
In settling of your Honor; which should be
Redoubled rather, that I hope to see:
So Power and Virtue when they fill one Seat,
The City's blessed, the Magistrate complete.
At the close of the Speech, this Throne of Virtue with all her Caelestiall
Concomitants, and the other parts of the Triumph, take leave of his Lordship
for that time, and till after the Feast at Guild Hall rests from Service; but
the Feast ended, the whole state of the Triumph attends upon his Lordship, both
to Saint Paul's and homeward; and in Soper-Lane two parts of the Triumph stand
ready planted; viz. the Throne of Virtue, and the Globe of Honor, which Globe
suddenly opening and flying into eight Cants or distinct parts, discouers in a
twinkling, eight bright Personages most gloriously decked, representing (as it
were) the Inward Man, the Intentions of a Virtuous and Worthy Breast, by the
Graces of the Mind and Soul, such as Clear Conscience, Divine Speculation,
Peace of Heart, Integrity, Watchfulness, AEqualitie, Providence;
Impartialitie, each expressed by Its proper Illustration. And because Man's
perfection can receive no constant Attribute in this Life, the Cloud of
Frailty, ever and anon shadowing and darkening our brightest Intentions, makes
good the Morality of those Cants or Parts, when they fall and close into the
full round of a Globe again, showing, that as the Brightest Day has his
ouercastings; so the best men in this life have their Imperfections; and
worldly Mists oftentimes interpose the cleerest Cogitations, and yet that but
for a season, turning in the end like the mounting of this Engine, to their
everlasting Brightness, converting it self to a Canopie of Stars: at the
four corners below are placed the four Cardinal Virtues, Wisdom, Justice,
Fortitude and Temperance, by each of them fixed a little Streamer or Banner, in
which are displayed, the Arms of this Honorable City, the Lord Majors, the
Grocers, and the Noble East India Companies: The outparts of the Globe showing
the Worlds Type, in Countries, Seas and Shipping, whereon is depicted or drawn
Ships that have been fortunate to this Kingdom, by their happy and
successful Voyages; as also that prosperous Plantation in the Colonie of
Virginia, and the Bermudaes, with all good wishes to the Governors, Traders and
Adventurers unto those Christianly Reformed Islands.

The Speech at Night, presented by Honor, A Personage mounted on the top of
this Vnparalel'd Masterpiece of Invention and Art, the Globe or Orb of Honor.
Honor.
BY Virtue you came last, and who brings home
True Honor, must by Virtue always come,
The right Path you have took then, still proceed,
For it is Continuance crowns each worthy Deeds:
Behold this Globe of Honor; every Part
It is composed of, to a Noble Heart
Applies Instruction; when it is closed and round
It represents the World, and all that is found
Within the laboring Circle of Man's Days,
Adventures, Dangers, Cares, and steepie Ways;
Which when a Wiseman thinks on, strait he mounts
To Heavenly Cogitations, and accounts
The vexing Spirit of Care and Labor vain:
Lifting himself to his full height again:
And as this Engine does in eight Parts rise
Discovering eight Bright Figures, so the Wise
From this Life's slumber rowz'd, (which Time deludes,)
Opens his Heart to eight Beatitudes:
And as I ( Honor) ouertopping All,
Here fix my Foot on this Orbicular Ball,
Over the World expressing my Command
As I in this Contemptuous Posture stand:
So every good and understanding Spirit
Makes but Use only of this Life, t'inherit
An everlasting Living; making Friends
Of Mammons Heaps, got by unrighteous Ends,
Which happy Thou standst free from, the more white
Sits Honor on thee, and the Cost more bright
Thy Noble Brotherhood this Day bestows;
Expense is graced when Substance follow Shows,
Now to no higher Pitch of Praise I Will come,
Love brought thee forth, and Honor brings thee home.
FOr the body of the whole Triumph, with all the proper Graces and Ornaments of
Art and Workmanship, the Reputation of those, rightly appertain to the
deserts of Master Garret Crismas, an Exquisite Master in his Art, and a
Performer above his Promises.

FINIS.
