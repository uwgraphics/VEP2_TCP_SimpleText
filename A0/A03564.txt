AS for to speak of noblesse spyrytuall. it is the most great noblesse that is
/ and that man may have. That is to have evermore his heart and his affeccyo^
unto his creature / to seek knowledge of him and of his ordenaunces / as
wherefore he made the aungelles / ye man / the woman / marriage / paradyse / hell
/ and where they ben / and wherefore he would be borne of the vyrgyn Mary / and
the which sygnyfyeth his deeds and his works* and also of the Antecryst and
of the deed bodies / and how a man should confess him and to whom. Now

MAster tell me what thing is god. My child he is a thing spyrytuall in ye
which is all dygnyte / and all perfeccyon / the which is knowing all things
/ all mighty / and evermore during without end / and without beginning of
another. and also he ne may be mesured ne comprehendid of man Enough for to se
him ne his beautes / ne may be noumbred / nor his dygne puyssau^ce / nor may
be taken of any manner entendement so much is he puyssaunt and great. And also
he is full of all bounte mercy and grace. Master may he be no moo but one
only god. My child / nay / For if there were many gods every of them should
be all puyssaunt and than might they make things contrary co^uenable yt one to
ye other the which is against nature dyuyne so yt he ne may be but one
substantyue / and one essence dyuyne the which is pryncypall cause effycyent
of all things and he is ye soueraygne god unto the which every heart desires
to come the which entendement humayne ne may comprehend ne Imagen. Master
wherefore is god called father. My child for the engendrement apperteyneth
pryncypally unto the father more than unto the mother / wherefore man should
grant unto god the most pryncypall party. Master wherefore call we not the
second parsone of the trynyte as well daughter as sone. My child for as much
as the sone is of more strong nature / for he took nature humayne in the
form of man and not of woman. Master wherefore is not the holy ghost called
of the sone and the sone were called mother. My child it is for that / that he
proceeds and dyscendeth also pryncypally of the one as of the other. Master
where was god before that he made the world. My child he was not in no place
corporell. For nothing was but he all only / but he was in him self father
and sone / and holy ghost in one self essence. Master where is he now. My
child god occupyeth no place. But his puyssaunce infynyte is ouerall / for he
governs ye things the which ben in the oryent / and those ye which ben in
the occydent / and generallye all the world / and therefore a man says that
he is all time and all things. Master knows god all things. my child /
ye: for in likewise as he is all puyssaunt also he is all knowing and all
seeing. Master in what manner made god the aungelles. my child he them made
fair and shynynge and without body and full of meruayelous bounte and saiges
for to be his special mynystres. Master how sinned the angels that god had
made to his semblaunce. My child they yielded not graces unto god of the great
grace and sovereign beauty that he had given them / but enpryded the^ i^
mysknowynge of their creature. Master what came of them. My child the most
great masters of them fell in to hell and ye other about us / and the other
in the air. Master wherefore dyscended they not all togethers in to hell. My
child for that / that the one sinned more grievously than the other so abide
they all about us / and in the air for to prove the holy persons. Master
wherefore ne redeemed them Ihesu christ as these men. My child for that that
aungelles ben of more strong matter and without body and lynned of their own
malice and will without any te^ptacyon of other / and also for ye nature angelyke
should convert them one time alonely unto good or unto evil / so that when
it is converted in to the one it may be conuertyd into the other by the which
they never had done well. Master wherefore ne made he them that they might not
sin. My child to ye end that by their merit they should have grace and
glory in paradyse. Master when god wyste that they should sin wherefore made
he them. My child for to desteny the good from the evil / and to the end that
the good be the moore confermed in bounte / as the paynter ye which sows the
black and of other evil colors among them that be fair for to make them
show the more fair / and in this suffers god the evil among the good / and
also god makes the deuylles and hell for to execute and to punysshe the cursed
and miserable sinners of this world and he made paradyse and the aungelles for
to gloryfye the good. Master knows the deuylles all things. My child of as
much as their nature is more spyrytuall than the nature of man / of as much
ben they the more subtyles and more sages / and known all things paste and
p^sent / but of things to come they know nothing without it be by some
co^iectures as in defaulte of the moon / and of such semblables / but of
thoughts of the man they know nothing / but god all only. Master may they
do what they will / My child they will not do no good / but they may do much
ill / and not so much as they would / but that that god them suffers
lycenceth to do. Master the good au^gelles may they sin. My child when the
ill au^gelles fell from paradyse by their sin the good were in such wise
confermed in good / that sethen they have wylled to do none evil. Master
know they all things / and mayen they all. My child they know as I told
the right now of the cursyd aungelles and do that / that they will / at the
will and commau^deme^t of god / for against ye will of god they may do nothing

ye master.

Master wherefore did god make men and women. My child for to know hy^ and
to love him / and for to fulfill paradys and for to put them in the places of
them in the places of the cursed au^gelles in paradyse / the which they have
lost by their pride and mysknowlege. Master whereof made god the man and the
woman. My child he made them of the slyme of the earth / and know thou that
the body humayne is of the four elements ye which ben the earth / the water /
the air / and the fire / so yt the flesh answers unto earth / the blood
unto the water / the wind the air / and ye heete natural unto the fire. And
know thou also my child that the man is made unto the semblaunce of the
world / for as the sky has two gretelyghtes the which ben ye son and the
moon. Also the man has two light is in his heed / the which ben the two
eyes. And as the skaye has.vij. planettes / In likewise has ye man vij.
partycyons in his heed. And as the sea receives in it all things / In
likewise the womb of ye man receives in hit all things necessary unto the
life of man. And the hardenesse of the stones answers unto the bones and unto
the nails. And unto the trees answers the members of his body. And unto the
grass the here is. Know thou my child that the body of the man is none other
thing but a tree overthrown having ye rotes upward / so that ye heeres ben
the rotes / and the body is the stock / and the arms and the legs ben the
branches. The which thing sygnyfyeth that we should be enroted upward in to
heaven in ye love of our creature. Master wherefore was the woman made of the
side of Adam more sooner than of any other party. My child if the woman had be
made of the highest party of the man she had been to proud and should have
mystaken the man / And if she had been made of the most lowest party of the
man / the man should have to much dyspraysed her. wherefore she was fourmed of
the myddle to the end that ye man her held for his company. Master whereof made
god the soul of the man and of ye woman. My child he it create unto his
semblaunce / for the soul is also a substance spyrytuall having entendement
/ will / and remembrance. Master made god the man and the woman with his own
hands. My child he the^ made all only at his word and commandment.
Master wherefore made god the man of so vile matter. My child to the end y^ he
were the more humble and to the end that the devil be the more confused seeing
the man made of so vyse matter to be in paradyse from whens he is fallen by his
pride. Master wherefore made god the bestes. My child god has made the good
beestes to the end that man be helped at his need / and has made the cursed and
myscheuous for to abate the pride of the man / for when they noyen him / he
may well think that he is a little thing as of himself wha^ he may not
resyst them. Also there be made many bestes for to give us exaumple to live as
these antes / or pysmares / and spyders the which contynuallye trauayleth in
their operacyons unto the exaumple of whom we should evermore travail / and
know that there is not any be but that has in him some marvelous nature
whereof we should praise god / and also we should take exaumple unto their good
co^dycyons as says ye holy scripture that says thus. Respice volatiliaceli.
etc. That is to say behold the birds of the sky the which ben purueyed of
the purueyaunce of god / and have no dread that god the^ shall ever fail / but
live evermore in good hope in (...)sing god and in demanding of his mercy /
(...) whom we should take exaumple / and by reason we should do hit more sooner
than the beestes that ne have wittene understanding / seeing the great graces
that god unto us has done the which ben made unto his semblaunce and redeemed
with his precious blood / and the which gives unto us so much of good in this
world. In such wise yt all the beestes plants / trees / herbs / land / and
see / planettes / and stars / and all other things ben made for to serve
unto the man unto his prouffyte and vtylyte / and yet he has lent us the
realm of paradyse if we will / of the which ye leest glory surmounteth all
the Joys of this world. By the which my child the man is well to blame the
which mysknoweth his creature ye which somoche of grace to him has done
seeing that the beestes the which ne have wit / ne understanding / him love
and thank in demanding pyteously his ryghtdygne mercy. Master where was
Adam create. My child he was create in ebro^ and after was put in to paradyse
terrester. Master what thing is in paradyse terrester / and where is it My
child it is a place delectable in the oryont over ye mountains of egypt
wherein ben trees of diverse virtues / and of such there are that who so eteth
of them he shall never have hunger / and of other by nature shall never dye.
Master where was the woman created. My child she was created in paradyse
terrestre / but the man was create without for be put wtin in possessyon. Master
wherefore sinned the man and the woman. My child by the decepcyon of the devil
and by their folysshe thinking trespassed the commandment of god. Master
when(...)e it deceived the devil them. My child / by envy for (...) ye was
full of sorrow of that that they should obtain his place in paradyse ye which
he had lost by his pride. Master in what form tempted the ennemy them. My
child / the devil appeared unto them in the form of serpent telling them
that if they ete of that fruit they should know as much as god. Master
wherefore ne created god the men confermed in grace as the aungelles. My child
god would that the men were semblable unto him as all things to take of him /
god would that all were borne of Adam. Master why had he not made them that
they might not have sinned. My child to the end that they had the more of
merit. Master how had they engendered in paradyse terrestre. My child as thou
sholdest put thine one hand wtin thyn other without any delectacyon. Master
how had these women chylded. My child without any doloure and ^^out ordure.
Master how had they be in paradyse terrestre. My child as a generacyon gone
one after the other. Master where is paradyse celestyall. My child it is in
the tenth heaven the which is above all the other heuens and is clepyd the
heuyn Imperyall for as much as it is more clear and more subtle in substance
/ and more fair than all ye other / In the which be^ the holy men and women
of paradys enbraced with the love of our lord. Master wherefore made god man and
woman when he knew well that they should trespace his commandment. My child
it was for his pleasure so to do for to show his infynyte might / and unto the
end yt he were praised ser^ra^ and honored / for all things love god in
their be(...)ge and also for they knew well y^ there shall be yet many
persons of more gretter merit and holiness as if they had not little sinned /
as saint Johan baptyst and ye apostles and dyscyples of our lord and many
other for as wytnessyth ye scripture right happy is he that may do ill / and
does it not when he may. Master how long abode Adam and Eve in paradys
terrestre. My child from the morning till unto ye hour of noone / for at
the.iij. hour Adam put the names in ye things / and about mydday they syn^ed
/ and at none they were banysshed / and at such hour dyed Ihesu christ.
Master in to what place yede Adam wha^ he was put out of paradys terrestre. My
child he yode in to Ebr(...) where he was create / and there engendered he
sons and daughters whereof we ben all comen where he went long ^yme his sone
Abell that Cayn killed by (...). Master sith yt the devil tempted Ada^ and Eve
why were they so greuosly punisshed. My child for that / yt they mystoke the
commandment of god for to obey to the persuacyons of ye devil / and that
they ne held them content with god that somoche of grace unto them had given.
By the which they sinned in.iij. manners. That is to understand in pride when
they mystoke the commandment of god. And in couetyse when they were not
content of y^ / that god unto the^ had given / and in the sin of the mouth
in etynge the fruit that god them had defended. Master when yt he repented
him: and also did great penance / wherefore was he not restablysshed after his
death in his first estate. My child for as much as y^ penau^te was not
suffycyent to the reparacyon of all those yt he had put from paradyse by his
sin wherefoore was necessary that the second person in trynytee which is
the blessed sone of god made the reparacyon for him / and how be it that the
blessed god is ever more merciful / he is ryghtwyse and reasonable. Master
wherefore sent not god an angel for to bye humayne lynage. My child for as
much that if the angel had redemyd the man / he had been subject unto the
angel and god has made the man to be in the state of aungells. And also it
was conuenable sithe the man had done the sin that the man him repaired /
and also my child thou sholdest know and understand that the blessed sone of
god in propre person would repair the health and sin of man and to bear the
penance and to suffer death and passion right dolorous for him and to humble
him to take our fragylyte and nature in the womb vyrgynall for to show the
great affection and the great love y^ he has toward us the which he made
unto his semblaunce. Master wherefore ne made god that an angel took nature
humayne. My child for theyse causes that I have now telled the / and also for
none angel ne other creature ne had puyssaunce to open paradyse but god all
only / and it was close unto ye man by his trespace / wherefore it was of
necessyte that the son of god were sent down here allow for to redeem
nature humayne / and for to open him paradyse / And know thou that he had in
him two natures. That is to understand nature dyuyne / for he was and is very
god / and nature humayne / for he was and is very man / and for as much
vaynquysshed he the devil the which had vaynquysshed the man and opened
paradys and was of the lygne of Adam and did for him penance. Master wherefore
ne took the fader and the holy ghost nature humayne as well as ye sone. My
child for that / yt the sone is the semblaunce of the fader and grants unto
him all things by the which it was a thing conuenable yt the sone all only
drew unto him the man for to draw him unto his fader above in paradyse.

Master wherefore would god be borne of ye vyrgyn Mary. My child god made the
man in four manners. The first was without man and without woman as Adam. The.ij.
was of a man without woman as Eve. The.iij. was of the man and of ye woman as
we ben Now was to make the iiij. manner the which is of the woman which is man
as is Ihesu christ. And the other reason is such for likewise as the death come
in earth by ye woman the which was Eve. Also ye life came in to the earth by
the woman. That is to know the blessed Vyrgyn Mary the which us has borne
the fruit of life eternal. Master how chylded she. My child she chylded
without pain and without dolor and abode entyer vyrgyn / and pure / and clean
from all spotte before the chyldynge / at the chyldynge / and alter the
chyldynge as the glass through the which ye son passes without making
therein any opening. But for as much as god would hold the order of nature he
abode nine months in the womb vyrgynal / and he walked not incontinent that
he was borne. Master at what hour was he borne. My child he was borne at
mydnyghte / and at that hour appeared in the sky a star much fair and
clear that it was marvelous to be hold / the son was fair as ye gold /
and peace and unity was through out the world / and obeyed unto one only
prince the which was named Caesar / and at that hour the dombe beestes spoke /
and Idolles of the sarazyns and paynyms fell to the earth Master wherefore
took he the gifts of the three kings. My child for in taking the gold he
showed yt he was king almyghtly / and by the ensence yt he was weary god: and
by the myrre very man / and the king the which bare the gold was called
Balthazar / and Jasper bare the myrre / and Melchyor bare the ensence. Master
in how many manners ben our sins pardoned. My child they ben pardoned us
in.v. manners. First by the sacraments of holy church y^ which ben.vij. that
is to know baptym / confyrmacyon / confession / the order of preesthode / the
sacrament of the auter / the sacrament of marriage / and the vnccyon / but
baptym is the first / and that the which most clenly puts out the sins
/ and after baptym / confyrmacyon and confession ben the most necessaryes.
Secondly our sins unto us ben pardoned by almesdede. Thyrdely by oryson^ /
and by fastings. Fourthlye by pardonynge unto our enmyes / and fyfthely by
charity. Master ben all our sins pardoned by baptym. My child ye / for by
baptym we ben as men unto Jesus christ in doing him this homade / and we ben
delivered from ye seruytude of sin. Master wherefore ben they baptized the
which ben borne of the^ yt ben baptized / and also ye children the which have
nothing offended. My child if any paast were corrupt with venym all the
breed y^ which of it should be made should be venymous and corrupt. And for as
much as our fore fathers were corrupt by sin they and all their ^ygnee were
banysshed out of paradys terrestre / and unto them were shytte the gate of
paradyse celestyall / the which ne may be opened unto the man / if he be not
first baptized as wytnessyth the holy scripture / and how be it yt the father
and the mother ben baptized yt suffyseth not unto the child for to be baptized
/ for wha^ a man him baptyseth / nature comune ne baptized him but all only
the person pertyculer / wherefore it is of necessyte that we ben all baptized
in pertyculer. Master wherefore ne named god that all were baptized to be
saved. My child hit is not the deuaute of god that all ne been baptized / for
he has given unto every man and woman lyberall arbytre and fre will y^ to do.
Also baptyme should be made of free will and without constraynt for if god
constrained the man to be baptized he had not his lyberall arbytre / and so all
his baptyme had no merit. Master wherefore espouseth not man now his cosynes
as in the au^cyent law. My child hit is for to encreace amyte and love
between strangers / For those the which ben of blood loves each other
Inoughe more than these other / wherefore it behooves for to put love and
charity where it is not / and the other reason is such. For the children had
two proximitis togyders as to be sone and neuew wherefore for honest it was
ordained to make marriage between estraungers / but in the old law men
espoused the women of lygnage / and it was for to multyplye and to increase ye
world. Master wherefore was Ihesu christ baptized. my child he was
circumsyzed for to accomplysshe the old law. and baptized for to begin the
new law and for to show his great humylyte in gyuynge us example that we all
should be regenerate by baptym. Master wherefore is baptym in water. my child
for that water is contrary unto fire / wherefore for to quench the said fire of
sin we ben baptized in water. And in likewise as the water wassheth all
ordures and fylthes. Also the baptym wassheth all sins / and god them
establysshed in water for as much as the water is comune over all the world
to the end yt a man find the sooner water of ye said sacrament to ye end yt
none ne may excuse him that he ne could find whereof that he might make him to
be baptized or that he might have. Master what word ought a man to speak in
baptym. My child a man ought to say thus. I baptyse the in the name of the
father / and of the sone / and of the holy ghost amen. In putting three times
of water upon ye heed of him that a man baptyseth / and so may they say in all
languages / so that it be in good believe and in good intencyon and other words
the which ne ben of the necessyte of the said sacrament of baptym. Master was
it a thing reasonable that god the fader gave so noble thing as is the sone
for to by again so caytyf a thing as is the man. My child in that us shows
god the father ye great and abu^daunt love that he has unto creature humayne.
Master sith yt god has sent down here allow his son by so great charity
and for to redeem ye humaynes wherefore did men to him so much of pain. My
child Judas him betrayed by couetyse. Pylate him co^de^pnyd for dread to lose
his office / and the Jews him put to death by envy. Master wherefore dyed Ihesu
christ on the tree of the cross / My child for as Adam sinned by the tree of
life. Also god him would bye again by the tree of the cross and thou sholdest
know that by the four parties of ye cross the which shows all the world /
it is again showed unto us that the death of Jesus christ was suffycyent for to
bye not only nature humayne / but also all the universal world if it had be
lost. Master how long abode Ihesu christ in the earth deed / My child he
there abode.xl. hours. And when we say that he arose the third day / and that
in three days is nor.xl. hours thou sholdest understand that he dyed the
friday at the hour of noone / and all the saterdaye he was deed in the holy
sepulcre ye which is the second day / and the sunday after he arose right
erly / and for as much as the course of nature is renewed at mydnyght and the
day / in taking one party of the day for all the day entyer. Master whyther
yede the soul of Ihesu christ when he was deed My child he yede in to glory
toward god the fader in yeldynge unto him thanks and praysynges in
demanding him the holy souls the which he had redeemed by the merit of his
holy passion / the which thing god him granted. Than opened the soul of
Ihesu christ the which was coniuncte with the deite the gates of paradys the
which had been shyt by longetyme unto all humayne lygnage / and ye saturday
about the hour of mydnyght he descended in to hell and brake the gates and
yede to vysyte his good friends. That is to understand the souls of the holy
ancient fathers the which greatly him desired and them delivered from the
prison of the lymbe with all the holy souls the which have meryted paradys by
their holy works / and this fair company mounted in to heaven and them
presentyd unto god the father the which them received benygnely and them
puts in to the realm of paradise in ye places and syeges that the cursed
Aungelles lost by their pride. And he delivered not the souls of the damned
as Judas / and of the cursyd rich man dyues and of many other / but them he
left in hell in pain and in turment with all the deuylles without gyuynge
them any comfort where they ben yet and shall be for ever. And on ye so^day
before the son rysynge returnyd the soul unto the body of Ihesus that lay in
the Sepulcre / and rose from death unto life. Master wherefore arose not he as
soon as he was deed. My child for a man had little presumed that he had been
deed / and he would begin for to renew the world on the Sunday by his
resurreccyon. For at such an hour all the world began to be. Master where
was he after his ^esurreccyon / forty days before his ascencyon. My child he
was in Paradys terrester. with Helyas and Enoch in enstructynge them y^ which
was done as when he appeared. Master how many times apered he. My child / he
appeared first unto Joseph of barmathye y^ had buried him / ye which for so
doing was put in prison. After unto his mother: after to the blessed
Mawdeleyne: after unto the.ij. pilgrims coming from the holy sepulcre: after
to saint James the which would not ete till that he had seen him. After unto
saint Peter after to the two pilgrims ye which went to the castle of malux
after he appeared unto his dyscyples ye gates shytte: after unto saint Thomas
when he put his hand in the side of our lord Ihesu christ: after unto his
dyscyples in the sea of Tyberyon / and so my child thou should understand yt
our lord Ihesu christ appeared.xij. times before that he ascendid in to heaven
Master who asce^dyd in to heaven with him. My child the Souls of the blessed
the which than by their merytes were saved / and also great multitude of
aungelles of heaven ye which him accompanied in singing melodyously and
yeldynge thanks unto god Master wherefore abode he.xl. days to mount in to
heaven after that he was risen. My child for y^ that he gave great pain.xl.
hours when he abode in the earth unto his friends and dyscyples wherefore he
would comfort them.xl. days / that is one day for every hour in tokenynge yt
for pain he gives great Joy / and also he did it for to conferme them in
the holy faith / as saint Thomas and other / unto whom he apperyd vysybly.
Master what is that to say / yt the sone is set on the right hand of his
father. My child it is to say that ye humanyte is in glory with the dyuynyte.
Master in what manner and form ascendyd Ihesu christ in to heaven. My child he
styed in to heaven in such form and manner as when he him transfygured before
some of his dyscyples in the mountain of Tabor that is to understand that he
had the arms stretched and lift up in heyght / and his face shynynge as the
son. And his vesteme^tes were white as snow / and a fair and clear cloud
descendynge from heaven / and it closed round about him and so mountyd in to
heaven in such wise yt they lost the sight corporal of him. Master wherefore
is ye sacrament of the awter made of breed / and of wine My child for as the
grain of the corn has been beten and flayled and had the sede cloven In
likewise the precious body of Ihesus was beten and scourged / and had the side
opened / out of ye which Issued blood and water / wherefore men put water unto
the said sacrament. And as the wine lepeth from ye grape by force of the
wryngyuge in the pressour. In likewise the precious blood of Jesus lepte from
his precious body on the pressour of ye cross / and it was not establysshed of
the flesh nor of the blood for a man may horror to drink blood and to ete
flesh / but it was establysshed of breed and wine / that is the most comune
refeccyon that is / and also the breed / and the wine ben the most comune and
the most profitable for to nourysshe the body. In likewise the sacrament of
the awter is the most commune / and the most profitable refeccyon for to
nourysshe the soul. Master how shall we understand that hit is the holy
body of Ihesu christ and his precyouse blood under the kind of breed and of
wine. My child as the breed and the wine that thou eatys and drynkest convert
them in to thine own body and in to thyn own blood. In likewise the
sacrament of the awter the breed and the wine saying the holy words by the
will of god / also changes them unto the precious body and blood of Ihesu
christ. And also he would do it for the great love that he has in us he would
evermore be with us. And it is in his power that to do / as of nothing he has
made all the world ye which is a more great thing. Than my child thou
sholdest believe steadfastly and without doubt for his pleasure was hit to
instytute in such wise. And how be it that thou see it not corporally / for
a body gloryfyed is inuysyble thou have the more of merit. For faith is none
other thing but to believe that thing that he sees not.

Master what say ye of the the which receives the said sacrament in mortal
Sin. My child / they crucyfye of new our lord Ihesu Christ and him
receives unto their dampnacyon. Master ye priest that is i^mortall sin /
may he sacre and admynyster the holy body and blood of Ihesu Christ. My
child ye / for the sacrament (...)e empayreth / ne amendeth by the condycyon
of the priest / as the son when that it shyneth upon foul things and
stynkynge lesyth not his clerete / but ye priest it does unto his dampnacyo^ /
and if he be with out sin it is unto his salvation. Master how long
abides the body of Ihesu christ in the womb of him the which him receives.
My child he there abides as long as the substance of the breed there may
amyde vndegested and no more / but thou shall understand that god there is and
also abides evermore with them the which ben in the state of grace. Master
/ wha^ many prestes syngeth mass the body of christ is it over all / My
child / ye / For god is and may be over all as thy soul the which is hoole
in every party of the body. Master should a man hate the ill. My child a
man should hate their cursydnes and folyes and not to do evil as they done /
but we should love our nature / for we be all ye sons of one father and of
one mother and bought and redeemed with one self blood / and if they do the
any wrong thou sholdest pardon them and pray for them unto the example of
Ihesu christ / the which prayed for them that him crucyfyed and put unto the
death. For it is the work most merytoryous that we may do. Master wherefore
have the evil so many of goods and of prosperytees in this world. My child
there is not so ill in this world but that sometime does some good deed. And
for as much as man did never any good deed but that it were reco^pensed / nor
never did evil but that hit be punysshed And for this cause god them sends
of great goods and prosperytees in retrybucyon of their good deed / and so
unto them gives puyssaunce and auctoryte upon ye good to the end y^ the good
ben proved by them / and sometime god sends trybulacyon unto the ill / to
the end that they amend them / and if they do it not nevertheless that shall
be in dymynucyo^ of their sins that they should suffer and have in hell. Or
they shall have encreasynge of other great goods temporals / but god gives of
trybulacyons and aduersytees unto the good for to prove them as unto Job / and
unto Thobye to the end y^ they dyspraysed the vanytes of this world / and
that they should not forgete their creature and that by their merytes in
taking all in pacyence they may have the glory of paradyse / and sometime god
them gives of goods to the end yt they be the more charytable and that they
augment in glory in paradys. The good dies sometime anon to the end that
they empeyre not for to avoid the perils and temptacyons the which ben in
this world / and also ye good lives sometime longely for to encreace them in
bounte / and to the end that by their good example and doctrine the ylle may
amend them / and also the ylle dies anon sometime for to make these other
ylle a ferde to ye end that they amend them / and sometime the ylle lives
longely for to prove the good / and also for god taryeth that they should
amend them / and so thou should understand my child yt the opinion of some
doctors is yt ye mercy of god is so great yt he suffers evermore ye man to
dye in ye best estate and purpose that he may find him. For god will not ne
also suffers not the death and da^pnacion of a man / but wylleth that convert
him and live eternally in paradys / and how be it that many dies suddenly and
without having space to confess them and to do penance and satysfaccyo^ How be
it unto such purpose may they dye and in so great contrycyon of heart that god
them takes unto mercy. Mastier shall the rich and the poor be egallye
guerdoned and rewarded. My child of as much as they be the more sage and ye
more dygne of as much shall they be the better rewarded wha^ they shall be
good / and when they shall mow be evil of us much shall they be the more
greuouslye punysshed. Master may god do evil. my child / nay: for how be it
that he be all puyssaunt / nevertheless it is not entendyd that he may do
things contrary unto reason / and that they ben Impossyble for to be. Master
wherefore suffers god yt the beestes have so much of pain / and also they
have not deserved it my child it is sometime that by ye sin of the man the
vengeance of god falls upon the beestes and upon theyse other goods to the
end that he amend him or for to prove him as Job. And also than beestes be^
made to sustain and to nourisshe the man by ye which they ben under his
subieccyon. And also for all things should serve us to that whereunto they ben
ordained / as the bridge the which is made to pass / or to go over. In
likewise my child god it suffers to the end that thereby we take example / for
sith that ye beestes suffers so much of pain for their poor life corporal
/ we should well more travail and take pain to get the life eternal of
paradys in the which a man shall live eternallye. Master knows god whether
that a man shall be saved or dampened before that he be borne. My child yes /
not that god it does in entencyon for to dampne him / for god ne dampnyth him
but ye man dampnith himself with out any constraynt but of his own will the
which is at his own lyberall arbytre or fre will. As we se the boterflye ye
which of him self and of his propre will him bre^neth in the candell. And how
be it that the said boterflye is sometime scalded with the fire of the candell
in such wise that often he falls unto ye earth / also he ryseth again the
best wise he can / and with all his power he puts himself again in ye fire
of the candell all holly that he there abides / not withstanding that he
sees well the daungere. Also done those the which dampneth themself / for
how be it that they se and know the danger that therein is / and also that
they ben often scalded by trybulacyous / and aduersytees to the end that they
convert the^ and that by inspyracyon dyuyne they have some remors / how be it
for that they cease not till unto that / that of their own will and without any
constraynt they put them so deep in ye fire that they there abide and shall
never go forth. And how be it that good will of simple will yt all men be
saved and has one so great a gift as the realm of paradys without any merit
/ and by such wise my child know thou yt god has made ye man not to the end
that he be dampened but to the end that by his holy operacyo^s in suffryng
pacyentlye trybulacyons and aduersytees / and in resystynge and fighting
valyauntlye against the devil / the world and the flesh / he may merit to
be saved. Master those ye which ben predestynate to be saved may they be
saved without deseruynge it and to travail therefore. My child nay / for god
knowith well that by their merytes and trauayles they shall be saved. And in
likewise may a man say of the dampnyd. Master sith that those the which be^
predestynate to be saved may they not be dampened and those ye which should be
dampened may they be sauyd what avails it else so much to travail for to
have paradys or hell. My child if thou be predestynate to be saved in the
glory eternal thou sholdest not increase thy pains in purgatory / and to
less thy glory in paradys by fault to do well / and if thou be predestynate to
be dampened thou sholdest not therefore evermore live in sin / but thou
sholdest evermore enforce ye to do well / and to do penance for to less thy
pains in hell and for as much as thou know not whereunto thou art
destynate / thou should always think on ye better perty yt is to understand
yt god the has made unto his se^blaunce / and has bought ye with his precious
blood for to save ye and not to dampne the. wherefore my child thou should
evermore do good deeds and to fle the ill and know thou my child yt god ye
has given wit and understanding reason and fre will and lyberall arbytre to
chose the good or ye ill to the end that thau have not any cause of Ignorance
or of Impuyssau^ce. Master what say ye of them ye which never hereth the
commandments of god ne none they done. My child the men ben made unto the
Image and unto ye semblau^ce of god to the end yt they him love serve and dread
and therefore if they know not their creature in this world we shall not know
them in ye other / ne yet by their Ignorance they shall not be excused but
more sooner accusyd / for ye Ignorance excusyth not ye sin. Master if a
child were nourysshed in a wood and he had never hard speak of the faith of
Jesus christ shall he be dampened if y^ he dye in such wise. My child it is a
thing to believe yt god makes reuelacyo^ unto every person of ye faith of
Jesus christ by techynge of man or by reuelacyon dyuyne or otherwise / and if he
go against the said reuelacyon know thou yt he shall be dampened. Master ben
the souls made from ye beginning of the world. My child nay / but god them
creates all the days and the^ puts in ye bodies of ye children wtin the
womb of their mother that is to understand unto men at.xl. days after their
co^cepcyon. Master what avails us co^fessyo^. My child it is the second
baptym. For in likewise as by baptym all sins be pardoned. In likewise by ye
virtue of the sacrament of co^fessyon all our sins be pardoned / for as much
as a man knowlegeth his defaute before god or before his lyeutenaunt for God
loves more obedience tha^ sacryfyce / for obedience is mother of all virtues.
Master avails more penance don by enioynynge of the co^fessoure than
penance don by will. My child if thy co^fessoure ye has enjoined in penance
one pater n^ all only / and thou leave it to say an hole sauter syn^est / and
thou shall not acquyte ye of thy penance / but if thou saydest the Pe^nr^ y^
which to the was enioynyd / and you leuest to say the sauter or other many fair
orysons / yt you say by simple will you shall not syn^e / but you shall acquyte
ye of thy penance / for as I have told the more better is obedience done to
our lord than does the sacryfyce. Master what avails contrycion at the
point of death. My child those the which abides the^ to repent till unto ye
hour of death ben trechoures unto our lord as the trechoure and ill payer yt
promyseth for to pay at a certain term but he would that the term should
never come / and for this matter and cause he makes a.M. trecheryes unto his
creature to the end that he ne pay him so sone or never / and of ye other part
saint Luke says that god is not well paid of him the which him pays of that
thing yt he ne may no longer hold. How be it / it is written that at what
hour yt the sinner shall declare his sin in great repentance and co^trycyo^
that it unto him shall be pardoned. But my child it is a right great parell to
abide him to repent / for tha^ a man is so troubled that a man knows not
himself nor none other / for as says the psalmys (Om^no^ est in morte q memor
sit tui: in iferno au^t quis confitebitur tibi) That is to say yt as the deed
man has no remembrance of god / and that is no time him to repent and to
confess his sin when that a man is in hell for the sentence of god is given.
Than my child thou should repent and confess ye wha^ thou have time and space
/ and thou sholdest not tarry till to morrow / for you know not whether thou
shalt deye to morrow or sooner.

Master sythen that the sin of pride is perdoned by baptyme wherefore dies
those the which ben baptized. My child the good deyeth to the end that they
ben taken from the trybulacyon of this world / and they be crowned in the
realm of paradys / and the evil deyeth by their sins to the end that they
be put from the Joys and delytes of this world / and ben in great doloure
punysshed eternally in hell. Master what noyeth ye sodyen death unto the man.
My child yt man the which dies so daynly / so that he be in the state of
grace he gothe in to paradys or in to purgatory to accomplysshe his penaunces /
and unto him the sharp death is merytoryous against his sins venyalles and
unto ye dymynucyon of the pains of purgatory and unto the augmentacyon of the
glory of paradyse / and if he dye sodeynlye in mortal Sin the sodeyn death
him puts in as much as he is vnpourueyed and without co^fessyon ne
repentance taking / than he is damyned eternally / and by this and for this
cause my child thou should be evermore ready for to deye in keeping ye from
syn^e / for thou know not when ne of what death thou shalt dye. Master
what avails it a man to be buried in the church yard. My child if he be i^
purgatory he is the sooner delivered as well by the prayers of the church as
of his kynnesmen and frendys ye which vysyteth his sepulture in prayenge god
for him. And often it happeth that the chyrcheyardes be^ sanctyfyed by the
bodies of some saints that there be / and prays for them / whereof if those
that there ben buried ben saved they be right Joyful wha^ their bodies ben with
the bodies of other saints / but if they ben dampened it profyteth them
nothing. For the good deeds yt men there done for them ne may help them.
Master what manner of life is the most excellent and best for to make his
salvation. My child to have a true affection of true love in our lord in
serving him and honourynge with all his heart and in eating y^ breed yt thou
have Justly and laufully gotten by the travail of thy body as wytnessyth ye
psalmyst ye which says. Labores manuum tuaru^ qr manducabis. and. That is to
say that thou shall be right happy if thou eat the labor with thyn own
hands whereunto it is showed the y^ thou ne sholdest use of the goods the
which by ye or by thine be gotten falsely / but you should yield them if thou
know unto whom / and to use of them the which ben Justly and loufully
gotten.

Master he ye which is in mortal sin may he belong without co^myttynge
syn^e* my child nay / For as one good deed draws another. In like wise one
ill draws another / for so ye devil makes of the man the which is in
mortal sin as a man does of a be y^ he ledyth by ye top where him
seems best. master whyder go ye souls of them yt be deed. My child ye souls
of ye Innocents yt deyeth without baptym gooth unto ye lymbe yt which is a
chamber of hell where they have no Joy nor heaviness / for they have nothing
meryted / but for as much as they be not purged from orygynall syn^e by
baptym they be put from paradys / and from ye vysyon of god / and the souls of
them the which ben baptized the which dies in the state of Innocencye gooth
in to paradys all right / and the souls of them the which dies in the state
of grace and without syn^e where if they have sinned and if they have done
penance suffycyent in this world gooth all right in to paradyse / and ben in
glory after that / that they have meryted by their holy works / and ye souls
of the^ ye which have had contrycyon and dyspleasaunce of their sins and ben
returned unto god in cryenge him mercy that they have not accomplysshed their
penau^ces i^ this world gothe in to an other part of hell named purgatory and
there they accomplysshe their penaunces and ben purged of their sins / and
that done they go in to the glory of paradys. And the souls of them the which
dies in one mortal sin or many goth in to the depenes of hell / where they
be^ punysshed after their deseruynge / and the souls of the Jews / and of the
myscreau^tes ye which dies in the estate of Innocencye gone in to a part of
hell with all the other children ye which dies without baptym / but the
souls of ye other Jews and myscreauntys yt have wit and understanding goth
in to hell with the dampened. Master in how little time ben the souls delivered
from purgatory. My child some there abides more longely than other after as
they have deserved for some ben delivered at ye end of.vii. days / and
therefore makes a man the semell otherwise called the return in making
prayers and almesdedes for their delyueraunce / for greatly unto them may
profit the prayers and almesdedes that is done for them. These other ben
delivered at the end of.xxx. days / and therefore is made the trentall. These
other ben delivered at the end of one year / and therefore is made the years
mind / and these other abides there by many yeees / and by long time after
yt they have deseruyd / and therefore make men remembrance every year of them /
and when they ben all purged and that they ben delyueryd as by their penau^ces
accomplysshed / as by our prayers and oraysons / they go all right unto the
glory of paradys. Master in what place is paradys. My child there are.iij.
manner of paradys / that is to wit paradys celestyall / paradyse terrestre /
and paradys spiritual. Paradyse celestyal is above all the heuens in the
which is god and all ye saints holy men and women as I have said before /
paradyse terrestre is in the earth toward the oryent / and paradys spyrytuall
is against god / and to love him perfytely and yt is over all In that paradys
ben our good au^gelles ye which sees and loves god. Master where is hell.
My child there are.ij. manner of helles / yt is to wit hell spiritual and hell
corporal / hell spu^all is over all where the souls and ye cursed angels be^
in pain and tourment be it in earth or in ye see / and this may be in many
places / as we read of a soul that was turme^ted with a flage of yse ye a
bishop delivered by.xxx. masses / who was bound to be there long time. Hell
corporal is in ye myddle of ye earth as ye carnell of an apple is in the
myddle of ye apple and is a great cave black and dark in which ben iiij.
stages ye one above ye other. At ye first stage is the place wherein were the
holy souls of ye holy fathers au^cye^tes and of them yt by their holy life and
co^uersacion have meryced the realm of paradys the which our lord Ihesu
christ delivered when he dyed on the tree of the cross and now there is none /
For at that time were all delivered. At the second stage is purgatory wherein
the souls the which should be saved goth to accomplysshe their penance the
which they have not accomplysshed in this world in their life. In ye.iij.
stage ben the souls of the Innocents the which dies without baptym. And i^
the.iiij. stage ye which is the most low in depnes ben the deuylles and the
souls of the poor and miserable dampened.

Master what pains have they ye which be^ in purgatory. My child they ben
turmented with the fire of hell much more hotter than ye fire matery all of
this present world in co^paryson against a fire painted upon a wall / and they
ben there bound with chains of fire all brennyng so sperke lynge that a man
ne can speak it. In the which place some ben there more punysshed than these
other / and there abide more longely than the other after as they have
deserved. Master what pain is there in hell. My child there are so many
diverse pains and tourmentes yt there is none entendement humayne ye which can
comprehe^de ne Imagen as of fire stynkynge and right brennynge / of todes /
serpents / dragons / and of al foul and cruel bestes / and of deuylles
enraged and wode the which never ben weary for to beat and tourment the poor
and miserable dampened / but evermore ben for to begin in such wise that the
leest pain of hell surmounteth all the pains of this world / but the one is
more punysshed than the other after their desert / and at the day of Judgment
their pain shall doubt / for than they shall arise and shall be dampened in
body and in souse. Master what pain have the souls of the Innocents y^
which dies without baptym. My child they ne have pain / ne doloure / ne Joy /
ne gladness. For they never did good nor evil / by ye which they have not
meryted to have any good / ne to have any evil and how be it yt the place
wherein they ben be dym and derke. All be it there is nothing the which them
greueth / and when the day of Judgment shall come that they shall rise they
shall be of the aege that our lord Ihesu christ was when he dyed on the tree
and all the other. Also the said children not baptized shall be content with
the ordenau^ce of god / and tha^ shall return again in to their said place
without ever to have Joy ne heaviness no more than thou have of that / ye thou
have no wings for yt apertayneth unto ye birds and not unto men / or as thou
have wha^ a king or any great prince dies and thou shalt not succeed his
realm and syng^ourye for thou know well thou art not he the which should
enheryte. Also they should not enheryte the glorious realm of Paradyse for
they ben exyled by ye sin of Ada^ and of Eve / of the which sin they have
not ben purged by baptyme. Master those of paradys se they those of hell. My
child ye / and y^ unto them is a great encreasynge of glory when they se the
pains yt they have escaped whereof they thank god without ceasyng / and also
the dampened sees the saved in paradys as we have in the gospel of the cursed
rich man Dyues the which saw the soul of the poor Lazare in the bosom of
Abraham in paradys / the which thing is to them a great encreasynge of their
doloure and anguysshe when they se the great goods spyrytuall that they have
lost by their sins and by their neclyge^ce / and after the day of Judgment
as the bodies of the saved shall be gloryfyed / they shall se the dampened
corporally / but the dampnyd may not se them corporally. Master ben the saved
wroth of the pain of the dampened. My child they that been in paradys would
well that those the which ben in hell had so well lived when they were in
this world / that by their holy works they had been saved with them. For
without ceasynge they pray for the humaynes lyuynges within this p^sent world
but sythen that they by their cursyd life and by their Sins they ben dampened
for ever / theyse of paradyse neither ben heavy nor dysplesaunt. For in Paradyse
there is not of heaviness / nor of dyspleasaunce of any manes thing. But all
Joy / myrthe / and gladness without end. Master the ancient fathers
suffered they any manner of pain in the lymbe of hell My child nay / but all
only that they were holden in derkenes and in captyuyte. And were put from the
vysyon of god and above evermore their delyuerau^ce. Master what knowledge have
the Just the which ben in paradys. My child they know the good and their
merytes and of the cursyd also / and ye curknoweth wherefore they ben dampened /
and knows as we that thing that they se and feel. And those of purgatory ne
knows nothing of this world / if it be not by reuelacyon of angels ye
which them comforts or of ye saints of paradys. These of paradys shows
them when they will / and unto whom they will / but the dampened shall never
come forth of hell till unto the day of Judgment that they shall come to take
again their bodies and to here the sentence of the soueraygne Judge / and after
they shall return in to hell from whens they shall neuermore return. And if
that it happen sometime that it seems unto us yt they show them it is but ye
devil ye which shows them unto their semblaunce / if it be not by the
suffraunce of god that they show them sometime unto some holy persons as god
it will by his miracle as me^ says on many / but it is not at there will ne
they be not eased of their pains. For they bear evermore their hell with them
/ and so they ben ever more in hell. Master how say ye of these women the
which says that they them se in the air of these feyryes / and of these
gobelyns the which them calls elues / and many other things. My child the
women ben most varyables and more light of believe than men / and therefore was
Eve tempted before Adam. For the ennemy thought well yt when he had won her
that she should help him to win Adam and therefore the devil showed more
sooner his vysyons unto women than he did unto men / how be hit that some men of
little feyth there be^ often deceived and for as much that some women ben of
more light believe of as much the more the devil shows of vysyons unto them
in their mind for to draw them from the faith of Ihesu christ / And thou
sholdest understand that these old wytches the which says that they go on
the satyrday far from their houses or that they do or se things maruaylous
that they ne do nothing / but by the great fault of faith that they have and
by their foly^she believe and for as much as they ben in sin / for they be
Idolatres and with out faith the devil unto them shows those folysshe vysyons
in their ente^dement for the better to bring them unto his line / for in
truth else they remeue not from their place no more than does a stone / and
their vysyons ben semblables unto them of a man the which is drunk / unto
whom it seems that the house turns under his fete / by ye which he falls
and all the house ne the earth remeueth not. In like wise the devil them
shows these vysyons in their entendement / and also the devil him shows in
the form and semblaunce of some personage / the which they know that should
be deed.xx. or.xxx. years past or in form and semblaunce of some of their
neighbors / and shall speak to them famylyerly as it were themself to the end
that they believe him the better / and that he deceive them the more lightly /
but it is nothing else but ye devil himself ye which him shows unto them
in body fantastycall as for to deceive them / and also makes he y^ it unto
them seems yt they goo in to a medowe grene full of fair sloures unto whom
they make great there. But it is nothing / for they ne be put Illusyons made
by the ennemy of mature that he puts in their entendement / and it seems
them somtymes y^ they enter in to an house the gates shytte / and that they
take the gaders of a child and eteth them and goth in to the celler / and
drynketh as much of the best / and of that deed they go away with out that / yt
the child has any ylle / and that ye wine is nothing ye less in the tonne
the which is a thing Impossyble / for all ye sorcyers of the world ne all
the deuylles ne can make pass a right great body humayne by a little clyfte /
ne enter wtin a house / but y^ he have open passage for to enter / ne to draw
the entrayles fro ye body of a child without killing or hurtynge it / and when
it shall be deed they can not areyse it / ne they can not draw ye wine of a
ton^e without yt there be less of one drop / for they ben werkers yt all
only ben unto the puyssaunce of the sovereign creature / wherefore my child
thou should put no faith unto their sorceries and deuyneme^tes / for they ne ben
but false Illusyo^s made by the enemy of nature yt he so^tymes shows
somethynges for to come ye which he knows by some co^iectures as I have told
ye before in speaking of ye science of ye devil / and sometime the devil unto
them shall show a theft in saying the truth to the end yt they believe the
better in him / and y^ the malfactoure be ye more defamed / and also shall say
often truth to the end y^ he be ye sooner believed when by his false reuelacyon
he shall accuse some holy and devout personage / of whom he ne may be
otherwise avenged / and for this cause a man shol^e not believe them / for they
ne be but Illysyons and false vysyons of the ennemy the which ne does but lie
for to deceive the man / and also a man should not believe such people / for ye
devil has not any puyssau^ce upon the man with out so be yt god him suffer / and
unto the regard of ye feyryes the which man says were wont to be in times
past / they were not men nor women naturalles but were deuylles ye which showed
themself unto ye people of yt time for they were paynyms / Idolatres and with
out faith / and the said feyryes changed them in to many fourmes / as of an
horse / or of a dog / or otherwise the which is Impossyble unto nature but ye
devil may well show him i^ many manners and change ye body wherein he shall be
put and in taking again another of an other form as you may change thine
habyte in taking the habyte of a relygyous man / or of a woman / but unto the
truth all the wytches of the world ne all ye deuyls of hell can not change
one kind in to an other / as a man in to a dog / or a dog in to an ass /
for it is Impossyble unto them yt to do / wherefore thou may well think yt
theyse feyryes y^ in such wise shewid them in diverse fourmes and kinds ne
were men ne women / ne other thing natural but were deuylles yt in such wise
showed them / and ye which put the^ in their Idolles and spoke and said some
things for to come by some conjectures / as by the Influences of the bodies
celestyalles / for otherwise ye devil has no knowledge of things for to come
and by this mean ye said feyryes said yt ye people were destenyed ye one unto
good ye other to ill after the course of heaven and of nature / as a child
borne in such an hour and at such a course / he was destenyed to be hanged
or drowned / or yt he should be rich or poor or yt he should wedde such a
woman / ye which things ben false / for the man has in himself lyberal
arbytre and fre will to do good or ylle in such wise that if he will he shall
do nothing wherefore he should be hanged / nor yet put him in the danger to be
drownyd / nor also he shall not marye a woman but if he will / and so her
destynacyons shall be self. By theyse reasons a man should put to no faith /
for as says ye psalmyste (Vir sapiens dominabitur astris) That is to say /
that the wise man should have lordeshyp above the sterres and planettes / For
he shall not govern him after his sensualyte and inclynacyon natural / but he
should govern him wisely by reason following the good and eschuynge the ylle /
for the will of man is so free yt nothing may not make hit vnfree / and if yt
man should do good or evil by force against his will he should not have
lyperall arbytre / and so his life should have no merit / the which thing is
false and against the faith / wherefore my child thou sholdyst not believe hit.
It is also defendyd upon the pain of death / and of dampnacyon eternal / and
in regard of these wordys / and of these spyrytes and elues / and also of many
other vysyo^s that men say yt they se by night they ben often deuylles that put
them in form of some deed body in faynyng his voice to tempte ye person of
some thing / for as says ye psalmyst. (Spiritus vadens and non rediens.) yt
is to say yt after that the soul is departed from the body she goth unto ye
place where she has deserved without ever to return till unto the day of
Judgment / if hit be not by great necessyte / and by great miracle / as we read
of lazare and of many other / but elues / gobelyns / and helqui^s ye which men
se by night / as men of arms trotrynge on horsbacke with great assembles /
they ben all deuylles ye which ben among us the which shows them in such
a form and i^ many other fourmes as of a dog of an horse / of a tree / or
of a stone / and in many other fourmes for to tempte the man of some vice / and
for to make him err in the faith / and somtymes these deuylles comes unto
the stables and fyndeth the horse and tourneth all that the which was above
underneath by derysyon of the man and for to tempte him / and some time they
unbind the little children and them casts from the cradell for to make the
father / and the motherwroth and often kill ye children wha^ god it suffers /
for the sin of the fader / or of the mother / or for to prove them as he did
Job when he suffered that the devil him did so many of ylles / and of
tourmentes for to preue him in his great pacye^ce for without the permyssyon of
god they have no puyssaunce / but ben as the hang man ye which without the
bidding of ye Judge may not hang nor beat any evil doer. wherefore my child
thou sholdest return the unto god and unto the saints and to live holyly as
says the psalmyst (Non timebis amore nocturno. That is to say thou shall not
dread of those folysshe vysyons by night. For they be not but Illusyons made by
the enemy as it is said. Master may the ennemy be constrained to come by
words or by signs. My child nay / if he ne will / but they ben the
cou^tenau^ces yt he has with those that be^ of his sect ye which in saying
some words / or i^ making some tokens or carateres thither comes and makes
that / that he demands / to the end yt he them hold the better in his line.

Master what say ye of these dremes. My child you should take none head unto
them for they ne be but vysyo^s of some things on ye which a man has thought
or seen before waking / and a man dremeth often of that ye which is semblable
unto his complexio^ master how know ye prophets tho days that: yt they saw
by dreme. My child that was not by dremes all only / but it was by the
reuelacyon of god for with the vysyon they had an Imagynacyon and believe
especyall in the bounte of our Lord that / that same thing that they had
seen in slepynge came. Master sith that God dyscendyd in earth for to save the
sinners wherefore be^ they dampened. My child there is not so great a sinner in
this world that and if he reknowlege his sin and cry god mercy with good
heart but yt he be pardoned by the merit of the death and passion of Ihesu
christ / but those yt will not knowledge thyr sin but ben obstynate till unto
the death / know thou that they ben damned eternally for God saves not the
sinner the which will not save himself / and also paradyse is not deseruyd by
sin but it is lost. Master sith yt god dyed for our sins / wherefore be we
baptized. My child for ye baptym is the homage y^ we owe unto our lord Ihesu
christ by the which all our sins ben pardoned and in such wise ordained he
it as tells ye gospel that says thus (Quicu^que baptisatus fuerit. That is
to say who so shall be baptized shall be saved / and he that is not shall be
dampened. Master how many persons shall be saved. My child there shall be as
many saved as there fell of the cursyd aungelles of paradys by their pride /
for the men and the women ben made for to be in their place / and for that
cause is the ennemy so enuyous against man. Master from whens came the first
Idolatres. My child they were first found in abell the which is now called
babylon y^ great and there shall the antecryst be borne and there was the toure
with the gyauntes the which is of.xl. stages. There reigned the first king of
this world the which men called Neron ye which caused to be made an Image of
Appolyn / and commaundyd all those of his realm that they should do him
sacryfyce and worshypped him / and in likewise did they the which came after
him in such wise that when some great princes were deed their successoures
caused to make of Images maruaylously rich i^ the name of their predysessoures
/ and made their subgettes to adoure the^ / and to do sacryfice and were called
Idolles in to whom ye devil entered and spoke and told them many of abusyons
and so did they of greece unto their king and they of rome unto Romulus as men
find by ye wrytynges and ancient chronicles.

Master wherefore ne made God that man ne should ete but one time in a weke. My
sone ye honger is one of ye passions y^ we suffer by the sin of Adam / and so
we have every day ho^ger: and thyrste / cold and heet / and many other
passions / to the end that we travail always for to think on our needs and of
our neighbors / to the end that by our travail / and labor contynuall we
have the more merit / for if the man had not of necessyte he should have no
care to travail but he should be evermore in slouthe / and should not know
what good were worth / and also he should mysknowe his creatoure. And how be
hit that the great lords and ge^tylmen and other that be rich trauayleth not
corporallye. All be it that they trauayled spyrytuallye evermore. That is to
understand in their understanding and will in having evermore desire to get
/ for he that most has and more would have most has in thinking / and so
my child none ne may live without pain and travail / but every man has
much to do in his right.

MAster what by tokenyth the mysteryes / and cermonyes that me^ make unto the
church. My child they show us good exaumple / and we figure the old
testament and the new and our lord Jesus christ is louyd in ye church at the
hours of matens / For at such an hour he was taken of the false Jews and
led unto the great prestes of the law / as it is written in the hours of the
cross / at pryme / for at such hour he was led and brought before Pylate
where he was falsely accused and vylaynously scourged at the third / for at
such hour he was crowned with thorn and clothed with purple by derysyon and
was cladde with a white robe in ye house of Herod by great mockerye / at the
syxte / for at such hour he was hanged and nailed on the cross at noone /
for at such hour he dyed on the tree of the cross / at even song time / for
at such hour his pretyous body was taken down from the cross and anointed
with precious oyntementes / and at co^plyne / for at such hour he was buried /
and thou shalt understand that in the mass unto us is fygured ye death and
passion of Ihesu christ by ye aulbe ye white robe wherewith he was cladde / and
by the chasuble the robe of purple and men say the pystle on the right hand /
for it is the token of the good life the which ledeth unto ye right hand of
paradys / and men read the gospel on the left hand / for by the left hand
unto us is sygnyfyed sin / for the gospel is the most strong and of most
great virtue / and therefore it is put on the lift hand for to defend us
ayens sin / for a man should evermore put the most strongest against ye
party from whens comes ye strokes / and the Images well hydden in showing yt
god and the saints of paradys have abhomynacyon of our sins and to speak
well there ne is cermonye / but that it show unto us some great mystery.
Master how should a man confess him. My child thou should first examyn by thy
conscience in recordynge ye places where thou have ben and how thou there have
lived / for there ne is thing yt better does to think of sins as to record
the places where a man has be / and in so doing you should examyn thy
conscience. First of thy five wits naturalles. That is to know of thine eyes
/ of eeres / of hands / of touchynges / of the mouth / of the nose / and of
all thine heart. Secondely also of the.vij. mortal sins / and of their
branches the which ben.vij. that is to understand pride / couesyse / envy /
Ire / glotony / lechery / and slouthe. Thyrdely of ye.xij. artycles of ye faith
yt ben contained in the creed. Fourthly of the.x. commandments of the law
the which our Lord gave unto Moses. Fyfthly of ye.vij. works of mercy if
thou acco^plysshe them when thou may well do it. Syxtely of ye.vij.
sacraments of the holy church if thou ne have had in them perfyte believe. And
seventhly of the.vij. cardynall virtues / if you have had them i^ the and kept
as thou art bound to do: and that don thou should go to confess the with
great humylyte and co^trycyon and dyspleasaunt of thy sin / in having ferme
purpose to commytte them no more / for other wise thou repentest the not. And
when thou shall be before thy confessoure in great humylyte confess unto him
all thy sins entyerly / and clearly that he understand it in telling him
all the form and manner how and wherefore thou have committed them / and also
thou should tell the time and the place if thou remember it for if thou sin
the holy days / thou synnest more grievously than on the werkynge days / and
if thou sin in place hallowed thou synnest more tha^ in an other place / and
in confessyoge the thou sholdest hold the order of confession in techynge by
order thy Sins as thou haste them recorded before to the end that thou
forgete not / and so thou should tell all unto thy confessoure / for if thou
leave one unto thy wyttynge for shame or otherwise thy confession is none / for
it is not entyere. Ne also thou ne should depart thy confession in telling
the one half unto one confessoure / and the other half unto an other
confessoure / For also hit is not entyer and hole / and hit is nothing worth
/ but thou sholdest confess and shryue the entyerlye unto one confessoure of
all that / that thou may remember / How be it if after thy co^fessyon thou
remembrest some thing thou may well confess the unto an other / but yet
thou shall do better to return unto the first if thou may. Also my child
thou should confess the cyrcu^stau^ces of thy sins in telling that the
which has moved the unto sin / the fonrme and the manner that thou haste
holden in co^myttynge thy sin / and the ylle the which comes unto an other
and unto thyselfe. Also thou sholdest confess the of ill examples that thou
haste given unto an other by thy sin and also thou shall confess the of will
and consenting that thou have had / and of the pain that thou have taken for
to committee it / for who so consentyth to sin all only if it be mortal / he
synneth mortally as witneslyth the holy gospel. Also my depiction of master and
disciple ye master the dyscyple

child thou sholdest tell the dygnyte and proximite of ye person with whom
thou have committed the sin as if she were a virgyn / or a relygyous woman /
or married thy kynneswoman / or a common woman without namynge her otherwise. For
i^ thy confession thou should not confess the of the syn^e of another / nor
dyffame her / but thou sholdest all only tell her estate for to declare the
gretnes of thy sin / for of as much as ye person is dygne in whom the
sin is committed of as much is it the more great / and when thou have well
confessyd all thy sins whereof thou remembered the thou should cry god mercy
with good heart in great contrycyon and dyspleasaunce / and in demanding of
thy confessor the which is ye lyeutenaunt of God absolucyon and penance /
the which thou should accomplysshe entyerly unto thy power in great reverence /
and thou sholdest keep the from sin as much as thou may / and specially
during the time of thy penance. Master unto whom should a man confess him.
My child unto a priest dyscrete and wise the which knows what it is of
Sin and who has it not / and who that can dyscerne between the sin mortal
and venyall / for who so confessyth him unto priest not knowing / and
Ignorant puttyth his soul in great adventure for right often the confession
is nothing worth. Master may a man confess him unto any other but unto his
curate. My child if thou be in a strange country thou may confess the
unto him that thou will / And if thou be in thy parysshe and thou wylt not
confess the unto thy curate the which is Ignorant / or that thy Sin touch
his person / or that he show thy confession whereby there might come any
sclau^der / or by many other reasons thou sholdest demand license / and if he
will not give it the thou may take another of thine own auctoryte. But and
if thou confess the unto them the which have the power / and the puyssaunce
of the bishop / or of the Pope / as there be many great clerks and great
prechoures / thou may do it without lyce^ce of thy curate / so that thou be
confessyd unto thy curate one time in the year / thou may confess the else
where as often as thou wylt without license.

Master how and fro whe^s shall the Antecryst come. my child he shall be
borne in babylon of a cursyd man and of a cursyd woman the which shall be of
the lygnage of Dam and of ye womb of his mother he shall be full of ye cursed
spyryte and shall be nourysshed and confermed in enchauntementes and shall be
Emperor of all the world / and shall put ye people under him in four manners.
That is to understand the princes and other rich / and covetous by gifts /
for he shall have by his enchauntementes all the tresoures hid in ye earth.
The poor by great dread and rygoure of Justice for he shall make them
grievously to be martred. The clergy by conning whereof he shall be full / For
he shall conne y^.vij. arts and all ye other scryptures. and the devout
persons by tokens and by miracles yt shall be marvelous. For he shall make
the fire to dyscende yt shall brenne his enemies before him / and also he
shall make the deed men to arise / not truly / but ye devil shall enter in to
ye bodies of some dampened and the deuylles shall bear them / and anon make
them to speak by his enchauntement and to walk as if they were on live / and
shall reedyfye Ihrlm and there he shall make him to be honored as god and
there shall be received in great honor / and men shall come to him from all
parts / and he shall make semblau^ce to ye people by his enchau^tementes yt he
shall dye and that he shall arise and shall make him to be lift up in heyght by
the deuyls saying y^ he will wounte in to ye glory of paradys / and than god
seeing his great pride thither shall send his angels of paradys for to
confound him in such wise yt ye deuyls y^ shall lift him shall fle and shall
let him fall to the earth in such wise yt he shall give so great a stroke
upon ye earth yt he shall scatter so yt ye trypes shall lepe out of his belly
and so shall he dey myscheuously and the deuylles shall bear him vysybly i^ to
hell Than those yt by him has be^ deceived shall returnethem unto god and to ye
holy predycacyons of Helye and of Enoch yt they have before herd and shall be
confermyd in the holy faith of Jesus criste / and they shall have xl. days of
space for to do penance / and anon after they shall suffer sharp death.
Master i^ what age shall Helye and Enoch come. My child they shall come in
such aege as they were wha^ they were rauysshyd in to paradys terrestre wherein
they be yet and shall be till unto the coming of Antecryste the which shall
kill them / and shall reygne by three years and an half and shall hold his
syege in the mount of olyuete for to vaynquysshe and to trede underfoot the
Just men and there shall deye of a sodeyn death by the will and commandment
of our lord as it is said. Master what thing is yt / ye resurreccyo^. My
child it is wha^ yt a man comes again from death to life and there ben two /
that is to understand the resurreccyon of the soul when that it is deed by
mortal Sin / and is returned unto life by confession and penance / and the
other resurreccyon is of the body as when the bo^y the which is deed
retourneth unto life when the soul is put again in ye body / as we read of
Lazare and of many other. And as we shall be all at the day of Judgment.

Master at what hour and in what time shall all mankind arryse. My child /
we shall arise at such a day and at such an hour as Ihesu Christ arose at
Eester: and the good shall be rauysshed in the ye air with the other good the
which shall be areysed. And in that rauissheme^t they shall deye / and anon
after they shall rise / and in likewise believe we that it was done of our lady
and of Saint Johan the euangelyste. But the evil shall dye upon the earth in
great anguysshe and doloure of the great dread that they shall have / and we
all shall be of ye aege as our Lord was when he deyed on the tree of the
cross. That is to understand of.xxxiij. years. Master shall they arise in
the same flesh in the which they have lived in this world. My child / ye
for if a man were eten with a wolf / and that wolf of an other / and the
other of alyon / yet should heryse in his own body entyerly without that /
that there shall fail any thing unto the perfeccyon of nature for as the holy
scripture says. Capillis de capite vestro non peribit. That is to say / that
he shall not lose one only here of his heed / but that there shall be all
entyerly / For he that made all of naught can well sever one matter from another
and it return in his entyer and better than it was before. And i^ such wise
those the which have been crooked or lame / and ill formed / or who so has had
any fault in any member shall be right and perfyte entyerly. But the dampened
shall not be but as they were or had be in the aege of.xxxij. years. And from
the time that they shall be areysed they shall never deye / but shall live /
the good in glory eternal / the ill evermore in dyenge in the fire of hell
where they shall brenne without power to consume any thing / but shall be in
that doloure and in ye pain eternally. Master at what hour shall ye Judgment
be made. My child at mydnyght / at the hour that he dyscendyd in to hell.
Master how shall god come in Judgment. My child as he was when he mounted in
to heaven. Master where shall the great Judgment be made. My child hit shall be
made in the vale of Iosophat the which is as much to say as the vale of
Judgment. The which is nere to Iherusalem for to confound the ylle when they
shall se the place where our lord dyed for the sinners In that place shall be
all good and ylle / the good shall have their good angels with them / and the
ill shall have their ill angels. And all shall be of the aege y^ our lord was
when he dyed on the tree of the cross that is at.xxxij. or.xxxiij. years / and
the good shall be lift up in to the air with god and his saints / but the
ill shall be in earth with the deuylles for the grauyte of their sins / and
our lord shall show him in two manners / that is to understand unto the good
as he was when he transfyguryd him in the mountain of Thabor. But unto the
evil he shall show him as he was wha^ he honge on the cross and there shall
not be the wood of the cross / but a right fair and clear cloud in the
form and semblaunce of ye cross. And there shall be with our lord the
vyrgyn Marye on the one side / and saint Johan baptyst on the other side / and
the.xij. appostles the which shall Judge with god like as wytnessyth the gospel
/ the which says thus. (Sedebitis et nos iudicantes tribus Israel. And our
lord Ihesu Christ shall say unto the good. Come you unto me the which ben the
blessed sons of my father and I shall now give you the realm of heaven / the
which unto you is made ready from the beginning of the world. For when I have
had hunger ye have fed me in nourysshynge the poor the which ben my members
/ and when y^ I have had thyrste ye have given me to drink / and when I have
had cold ye have warmed me / wha^ I have be^ naked ye have clothed me / and
have done many works charytables / whereof I will now recompense you. And unto
the cursed in casting his sentence shall say thus. Go^ ye acursed unto the
fire of hell eternally ye which is made ready unto you from the beginning of
the world with all the deuyls. And this done our lord Jesus christ and all his
holy angels and archaungels shall mount with the good in to the glory
eternal of paradys. And the cursed so shall descend in to hell with all the
deuylles from whens they shall never come nor depart / but shall be evermore
in pain / doloure / and heaviness in ye fire of hell perdurably. Master which
ben those yt shall be damned. My child yt shall be the Jews / and mysbeleuers
and the cursed crystyens that shall deye in mortal syn^e without repentance.
And men shall se clearly at the day of Judgment the conscience the one of the
other / whereby every man shall give Judgment of himself and in this manner shall
be known all the good deeds and the ill. For a man did never any ill ne sin
be hi^ never so secret / but that than it shall be clearly seen and showed
openly before god and before all the world. Master what ben ye Joys of
paradys. My child they ben so right great that a man ne can tell them For the
saved shall se god face to face and shall know al things as the au^gelles.
The bodies of the saved shall be clear and shynynge as the son / they shall be
inco^tynent where they will be as ye thought ye which in contynent is borne
thither where hit lyketh. They shall have no shame to be all naked the one before
the other for they shall be all clensyd from sin and shall be so co^fermed in
the grace and in ye love of our lord and they may never sin more ne have any
ill thought / they ne shall have hunger ne thyrst / for they ne shall be more
subjects to the influe^ces of ye planettes meanly yt also makes ye degestyon
unto the body humayn but shall be there above in corruptyble and perpetualles
and fed of the grace of god / they can not cease to yield graces and
praysynges unto god of the great mercy that he unto them has done. And to
speak shortly the Joys of paradys ben so great that there ne is entendement
the which them can comprehend / For if all the goods / and all the Joys and
gladnesses the which ben / was / and shall be in the world were all to gyders
all that should be nothing unto the comparyson of the leest glory of paradys.
For all the Joys of this world ben transytoryes / and also passes as much.
But the Joy of paradys ben perpetuallys / and without end.

Master how many orders of au^gelles ben in paradys. My sone there be nine.
The first order is called the order of seraphyns the which is the most
highest / the second of the Cherubyns. The third is of the thrones The
fourth of the puyssaunces. The fyfte is of the princes. The syxte is of ye
lordeshyps and seygnourys. The seventh is of ye virtues The eight of ye.ix.
ordres as lords and sygnours above their servants archaungels. And the nynth
of the aungelles the which is most low and all the saints holy men and
women of paradys ben above them Master have we every of us his good angel
the which kepith us: My child every one have his good angel the which him
defends from the ylle / and styreth him to do well / and so had our lord
Ihesu christ of good aungelles for to mynyster unto him. And the Antecryst
shall have one to keep him from doing of somoche ylle as he may well. And the
aungelles ben of the last and most low order that is called properly the
order of aungelles I have now told the. Master wherefore loses the moon
sometime his clerenesse. My child the moon has none other light but yt / the
son unto her gives / so it happens often that the earth is found between
the son / and the moon in such wise that ye son ne may give her clerenes
/ and than she is all black / for the earth shadoweth her. But when the earth
is not dyrectely between them / but some part all only than is she clear in
as much as the son may se her / and when the earth is nothing between them
tha^ is she clear / for there is nothing between them. And for that cause
has the moon the back toward the son. Master what thing is the bow of
heaven the which we se in theayer. My child they ben the beams of the son
the which meddle them in the matter of the moon ye which is thycke the which
takes four colors ye which ben dysposed to receive many and diverse
colors after ye nature of herbs and of ye place where they grow. Master
fro whe^s comes the wyndes / thondres / frostes / snowes / raynes / dewes /
and such femblable thing. My child all these things comes of some vapoures
ye which a ryseth from the earth in heyghte by the virtue of the son / of y^
which some ben dry / and ye other moist and when such ye which be^ lift up
till unto ye mean regyon of ye air ye which is right cold they be^ made
thycke and begin to drop / and from thens comes the rain. And when the
cold is greatly destraynynge above so they assemble and congeleth / and from
thens comes the hayle / and when these drops falls here allow / and
fyndeth this bace regyon of ye air cold as in winter they also congele meanly
ye wind the which is cold and from the^s comes ye snowes and this dew is
made of ye self vapoures / ye which when they dyscende upon the earth / and
there fyndeth cold they convert them in to water. But when that these
vapoures ben dry and light they arise up more hye unto the third regyon of
the air the which is hot / for it touches the regyon of the fire in such
wise when the vapoures dry that these clerks calls exaltacyons passes in
the air and meteth the one with the other / the most stro^gest gadereth the
most weykest by the virtue of the son and of the moon and from thens comes
ye wyndes / and when these exaltacyons passes in mountynge by the mean regyon
of the air the which is right cold they meddle them with the cloud and
closes them wtin ye cold: and the heet of ye son stryketh bre^nyngly
between these clouds in such wise yt these exalacyons hot that been enclosed
wtin ye clouds will go forth / but they may not for the cloud is cold and
thycke ye which holds the se exalacyons enclosyd / if it be not by great
force / and vyolence / and when it breketh it makes a great bruyte in the air

and so it falls here beneth al enflamed and that is the lyghtuynge the which
is more hot than a brennynge fire / for that fire above is also more hot than
this here allow. But when these exalacyons ne fydeth no cloud in mou^tynge /
they mou^te in to the third region of the air the which is hot / for it
touches the regyon of the fire / than they inflame them and brenneth semynge

when thou have duly co^fessyd ye of all thy sins and have acco^plysshyd thy
penance after ye ordenaunce of thy confessoure and haste made satysfaccyon
suffycyent yt they ben pardoned y^ and forgyuen. The.xi. that we shall arise
all from death unto life at the day of Judgment in our own flesh and body
entyerly. The.xij. yt fro that time yt we ben a risen yt we shall live
eternally without evermore to deye / and the good shall be in the glory
eternal of paradys and the ylle in hell in wepynges and waylynges eternally.
Master what ben ye commandments of ye law. my child / there are.x. The
first is yt thou should worship serve and honor one only god almighty.
The.ij. is that thou should not swear by ye name of god in vain without cause
lefull and necessyte as in Judgment or in other cause semblable. The.iij. that
thou should halowe the feestes in serving our lord without doing any operacyon
corporal / and also in keeping y^ from sin as much as thou may / for the
^estes be made holy for to serve god and for to make the health of the soul.
The. iiij is yt thou bear houour and reverence and all obeysau^ce unto thy
friends spyrytualles and temporalles as ben thy fader and thy mother and the
pastures of holy church. The.v. commandment is that thou ne shalt beat ne
stryke no man nor do him any outrage of deed / ne of thought. The.vi. is that
thou should be no thief in taking from another / as by extorcyon / usury / by
strife / by dysceyte / or otherwise by falsenesse. The.vij. is that thou shall
not acco^plysshe the sin of fornycacyo^. The.viij. that thou shall not bear
false witness / as in forswerynge the in Judgment / or in speaking some false
words of de traccyon and defemacyon of any person. The.ix. is that thou shall
not coueyte another man's wise by concupiscence carnal. The.x. that thou
shall not be enuyous of another man's wealth in desiring to have his by
falsenes / or procuring his damage. Master how far is it to walk from
hens unto paradys and from hens in to hell. My child this questyon is Enough
till another time. But god give us grace to go out of the may of hell and so
well to follow the way of paradys that we may all thither come.

AMEN.
