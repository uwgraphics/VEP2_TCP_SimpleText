A learned commendation of the politic laws of England: vvherin by most
pitthy reasons and evident demonstrations they are plainelye proved far to
excel as well the Civil laws of the Empiere, as also all other laws of the
world, with a large discourse of the difference between the.ii. gouernements of
kingdoms: whereof the one is only regal, and the other consists of regal
and polityque administration conjoined.

Written in latin above an hundred years past, by the learned and right
honorable master Fortescue knight, lord Chancellor of England in ye time of
King Henrye the.vi. And newly translated into English by Robert Mulcaster.

To the right woorshipfull Ihon VValshe, Esquier, one of the Queen her learned
Iusticers of her highness Court of Commen plees. Robert Mulcaster wishes long
life and health.
IT happened me of late, (right woorshipfull sir) to light upon this little
Treatise, which I incontinent desired to run over, because yt seemed to
discourse upon some points of the laws of our Country, whereof I my self
then was and now am a Student. When I had over run it, my desire to read it,
became nothing counteruailable with the gladness that I had read it, for my
desire to read it came upon hope, to find some profitable lessons for my
study, but my gladness after reading sprang of ye excellency of thargume^t,
whereon I did not dream, neither to find so rich a Treasure in so simple an
habit. And because I wished all men to have part of my delight, me thought
it good to translate it into English forth of Lattine, in which tongue it was
first written. The aucthour of the book was one master Fortescue knight
Seriaunt at the law, and for his Skill and virtues preferred by king Henry
the.vi. to be Chancellor of this realm. The entry of the book it self
shows where, and upon what occasion it was written. It was written in Berry
in France, where Prince Edward son to Henry the vi. afterward slain at
Tewkesbury by Edward the.iiii. did then remain with his mother Queen Margaret
in the house of Renate her father duke of Angeow and king of Cicile, during the
time that Edward the fourth reigned in this Realm and Henry the.vi. was fledd
into Scotland. The occasyon was this: The Chancellor being fled into
France with the young Prince and perceiving his delight to be all bent to
Chyualrye as a thing of greatest need consydering he meant by force the
restitucio^ of his father, and thereby his own, to the kingdom of England,
took occasion (for that his hope was to see the Prince reign hear) to move
him to a division of his affairs, and as he armed him self against ye enemy,
so to adourne him self against his being king with skill of laws, which
do preserve each state so in peace that it may if need be, war, and so
guard it in war, that it may have peace in eye. Thargument is this, that the
skill of the Country laws is neadefull for the Prince, although not so deep
as the purposed professors, yet so full as to their honor may and ought to
fall in Princes. And for that the Prince should think ye thing to be a Princely
knowledge, he takes occasion by comparing the government of this Realm with
others, and the laws of this land with the Civil, with whom it is of all
men lightly compared and the betternesse of points wherein they both
travail, and provisions by the one wiselyer foreseen then by the other, to
prove the singularity of this state which it behooved the Prince to learn
seeing he was like to succeade his father, and to understand the laws, which
makes the state to be so singular. The particularies I refer to the book,
whereof thus much I do and no less could well say. Why I did choose your
woorship to be protector of my labors, I shall not need tedyously to
touch, it shall be suffycient to say that in choice of many, I pycked you
alone, not doubting your lyking in allowynge seeing mine eleccion in
dedycatynge and so commyttinge to thalmightye the good preseruacion of your
worship I humblye take my leave, this xii. of October

The introduction into the matter.
DVring ye cruel rage of ye late mortal warrez wtin the royalme of England,
when the most virtuous and godly king Henry the sixth with Queen Margaret his
wife ye ki^gz daughter of Iherusalem and Scicile, and their only son Edward
prince of Wales were forced to fly the land: and the king himself afterward in
the same civil tumult falling into the blody hands of his deadly enemies his
own subiectz was of them committed to prison, where he a long time remained in
strait captivity, the queen and ye prince her son thus banished out of
their country, making their abode in ye duchy of Berry, a dominion of ye
foresaid king of Ierus. The Prince shortly after growing to man's state,
applied him self wholly to the feats of arms, much delytinge to ride upon
wild and unbroken horses, not sparing with spurs to break their fiercenes. He
practysed also sometimes with the pyke, sometimes with ye sword, and other warlyke
weapons after the manner and guyse of warriors according to the use of martial
discipline, to assail and strike his companio^s, I mean ye young me^ ye
attended upon his person. Which thing when a certain au^cie^t knight, being
chau^cellour to ye forsaide king of England saw, who also in ye miserable time
did there remain in exile, he spoke thus to ye prince.

SEuie^te dudu^ in regno Anglie nephandissima rabie illa, qua piissimus ibidem
rex H. sextus, cum Margareta Regina consorte sua, filia regis Iherusalem et
Scicilie, ac eorum vnigenito Edwardo principe Wallie inde propulsi su^t, sub

quandoque mucrone, aliis quoque instrumentis bellicis, sodales suos iuuenes,

rudimenta, delectabatur. Quod cernens miles quidam grandaeuus, predicti regis
Angliae Cancellarius, qui etiam ibidem sub hac clade exulabat: Principe^ sic
affatur.

First he moves the Prince to the knowledge of the law. Chap. 1,
YOur singular towardenes most gracious prince, makes me right glad, when I
behold how ernestlye you do embrace martial feats. For it is convenient
for your grace to be thus delyted, not only for that you are a souldyour, but
much rather for that you shall be a king. For yt is the office and duytie of a
King to fight the batailes of his people, and also rightlye to judge them, as
in the viii. chapter of the first book of Kings you are plainelye taught.
Wherefore I would wish your grace to be with as ernest zeal given to ye study of
ye lawz as you ar to ye knowledge of arms, because that like as wars by force
of chiualrye are ended, even so judgments by the laws are determined. which
thing Justinian the Emperor well and wisely and advisedly pondering, in the
beginning of the preface of his book says thus. It behooves the imperial
majesty not only to be guarded with armez, but also to be armed with laws, to
the end yt he may be able rightly to execute ye gouernem^t of both times,
as well of war as of peace. Howbe it for your more earnest endeuoir to the
study of the law, the exhortation of the chiefest lawmaker Moses, sometime
capytaine of the Synagoge ought to be of much more force with you, then the
words of Justinian, whereas in the xvii. chapter of the book of Deuteronomie
he doothe by the auctority of god straitlye charge the kings of Israel to be
readers of ye law all the days of their life saying thus. When the king shall
sit upon the princelye seat of his kingdom, he shall write him out this
law in a book, taking the copye thereof of the priests the Levites: and he
shall have it with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he
may learn to fear the lord his god, and to keep his commandments and
ordinances written in this law.

And Helynandus expou^dyng the same says thus. A Prince therefore must not be
ignorant of ye law, neither is it tolerable yt he under the pretense of
warrefare should be unskillful in the law. And a littel after he is
commanded, says he, to receive the coppye of the law of the priests the
Levites, that is to say, of catholic and learned men. Thus much he: For the
book of Deuteronomie is the book of the laws, wherewith the Kings of Israel
were bound to rule and govern their Subjects. This book does Moses
command kings too read, that they may learn to fear God, and keep his
commandments, which are written in the law.

Behold the effect of the law is to fear God.

Whereunto man cannot attain, onelesse he first know the will of God, which
is written in the law. For the principal point of all service is to know
the will and pleasure of the lord or master to whom service is due. Howbeit
the lawmaker Moses first i^ this charge mencioneth the effect of the law,
that is the fear of God: and next he allureth us to the keepinge of the cause
thereof, that is to say, of Gods commandments. For in the mind and
intent of the exhorter the effect goethe before the cause.

But what fear is this which the laws do propou^ to ye obseruerz thereof?
Surely it is not that fear, whereof it is written, that perfect charity or love
expellethe fear. Yet this same fear, though it be bond and servile,
oftentimes provoke kings to the reading of the laws: but it proceeds not
out of the law. But that fear whereof Moses here speaks, which also
proceeds out of the laws is the self same fear, that the prophet speaks
of saying. The fear of the lord is holy, and endures for ever and ever. This
is such a loui^g fear as natural children bear to their dear pare^tz
commenly termed the reverence of ye child toward his parents, Whereunto there
is no punishment due, as a thing wrought by love. For this fear proceeds
out of the laws, which teach to do the will of god, so that it deserves no
punishment. But the glory of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and he
does glorify them. Yea this fear is eeuen that same fear, whereof Job after
that he had dyuerslye searched for wisdom, says thus. Beeholde the fear of
the lord is perfect wisdom, and to forsake evil is understanding. That the
forsakinge of evil is the understanding of the fear of god, this do the
laws teach, whereby it follows that the same fear proceeds out of them.

Gaudeo vero se renissime Princeps super nobilissima indole tua: videns quanta
auiditate militares tu amplecteris actus, conuenit na^que tibi taliter
delectari, nedum quia miles es, sed amplius quia rex futurus es. Regis ne^pe
officiu^ pugnare est bella populi sui, et eos rectissime iudicare, vt primo
regum cap. viii. clarissime tu doceris. Quare vt armorum, vtinam et legum
studiis, simili zelo te deditu^ co^te^plarer Cum vt armis bella, ita legibus
iudicia peragantur que Iustinianus Augustus equissima librans mente in initio
prohemii libri sui institutionum ait. Imperatoria^ magestatem non solum armis
decoratam, sed et legibus oportet esse armatam, vt vtrumque tempus bellorum et
pacis recte possit gubernari. Tu^ vt ad legum studia seruide tu a^heles,
Maximus legis lator ille Moses olim Synagoge dux multo forcius Cesare te
i^uitat dum regibus Israel diuina autoritate ipse precipiat, eorum leges legere
omnibus diebus vite sue, sic dicens: Postquam sederit rex in solio regni sui
describet sibi Deuteronomij Leges in volumine, accipiens exe^plar a
sacerdotibus Leuitice tribus, and habebit secu^ legetque illud omnibus diebus
vite sue, vt discat timere dn^m deu^ suu^, and custodire verba and ceremonias
eius que in lege scripta su^t. Deutero. ca. xvij. quod exponens Helyna^dus
dicit. Princeps ergo no^ debet iuris ignarus esse, nec pretextu militiae lege^
permittitur ignorare. Et post pauca, a sacerdotibus Leuitice tribus, assumere
iubetur exemplar legis, id est a viris catholicis et litteratis. Hec ille:
Liber quippe Deute. est liber legum, quibus Reges Israel subditum sibi populum
regere tenebantur. Hunc librum legere, iubet Moses Reges, vt discant timere
deu^ and custodire mandata eius quae in lege scripta sunt.

Ecce timere deu^ effectus est legis, quem non consequi valet homo, nisi prius
sciat voluntatem dei, quae in lege scripta est. Nam principium omnis famulatus,
est scire voluntatem dn^i cui seruitur. Legis tn^ lator Moses, primo in hoc
edicto effectum legis videlicet timorem Dei, co^memorat. Deinde ad custodia^
causae eius videlicet mandatorum dei ipse inuitat.

Na^ effectus prior est qua^ causa, in animo exhorta^tis. Sed quis est timor
iste, quem promittunt leges obseruatoribus suis? vere non e^ timor ille de quo
scribitur: Quod perfecta caritas for as mittit timorem. Timor tamen ille licet
seruilis, sepe ad legendum leges, reges concitat, sed non est ipse proles
legis. Timor vero de quo hic loquitur Moises, quem et pariunt leges, est ille
de quo dicit propheta: Timor domini sanctus permanet in seculum seculi. Hic
filialis est et non nouit penam, vt ille qui per charitatem expellitur. Nam
iste a legibus proficiscitur, que doce^t facere volu^tate^ dei, quo ipse pena^
no^ meretur. Sed gloria dn^i est super metuentes eu^, quos et ipse glorificat.
Timor aute^ iste, timor ille est, de quo Job postqua^ multifarie sapie^tia^
inuestigat sic ait. Ecce timor domini ipsa est sapientia, and recedere a malo,
intelligentia. Job ca. xxviij. Recedere a malo quod intellige^tia timoris dei
est, leges docent quo and timore^ hunc ipse parturiunt.

The Princes reply to the Chauncellours motion, Chap. 2.
THe Prince hearing this, and steadfastly be holding ye old man, spoke thus to
him. I know good Chauncelloure that the book of Deutronomie whereof you speak
is a book of holy scripture. The laws also and ordinances therein contained
are holy, of the lords making, and published by Moses: Wherefore the readinge
of them is a pleasant act of holy contemplacion. But that law, to the knowledge
whereof you counsel me, is humayne, made by men, and entreating of worldly
matters: Wherefore though Moses bind the Kings of Israel to the reading of
gods law, yet that thereby he forcethe all other Kings to do the like in
their own laws, that standethe by no good reason, seeing that of both the
readinges the cause is not like.

HEc vt audiuit pri^ceps, erecto in senem vultu sic locutus est. Scio
Cancellarie quod liber Deuteronomy. quem tu commemoras, sacrae scripturae volume^ est:
leges quoque and cerimoniae in eo co^scriptae, etiam sacrae su^t a dn^o editae:
and per Moisen promulgatae: quare eas legere sa^ctae co^te^placionis dulcedo
est. Sed lex ad cuius sciencia^ me inuitas, humana est ab hoi^bus aedita,
tractans and terrena: quo licet Moses ad Deuteronomy. lecturam reges Israel
astrinxerit, eu^ per hoc reges alios ad co^ssi^l'er facie^du^ in suis legibus
co^citasse o^ne^ effugit ratione^, cu^ vtriusque lectur', no^ sit eadem causa.

Here the Chauncelour Fortifieth his assertion Cap. 3.
I perceive (quod the Chau^cellour) by your answer most worthy prince how
earnestly you have considered and weighed the quality of my exhortacio^. So
that heareby you do much encourage me both more plainly, more largely and also
more deepelye to discourse ye same. Wherefore you shall understand that not
only gods laws but also man's are holy, forsomuche as the law is diffined by
these words. The law is a holy sanction or decree, co^mau^ding things that
be honest, and forbiddinge ye contraries. Now ye thing must needs be holy which
by diffinicio^ is determined to be holy. Right also by description is called
the art of yt which is good and straight so yt in this cespect a man may well
call us Sacerdotes, that is to say, geeuers or teachers of holy things (for so
by interpretacion doothe Sacerdos signify). Forsomuche then as the laws are
holy, it follows that the ministers and setters forth of the^ may right well
be called Sacerdotes, that iz geuers and teachers of holy things. Further more
all laws published by men have also their authority from godde. For as the
Apostell sayethe: Al power is from the lord god. Wherefore the laws that are
made by man which thereunto has received power from the lord, are also
ordained of god, as also appears by this saying of the auctour of al causes:
Whatsoever the second cause does, the sa^e does ye first cause by a higher
and more excellent mean. Wherefore Iosaphat the king of Judah saiethe to his
judges: The judgments which ye execute are the judgments of god in ye
ninetinth chapter of the second book of Chronicles. Whereby you are taught
that to learn laws though they be ma^s laws, is toe learn holy laws and the
ordyna^ces of good: so that the study of them is not with out a pleasant
sweetenes of holy co^solacio^. And yet such sweet pleasure was not the cause
as you suppose, werefore Moses commanded the kings of Israel to read the
laws of Deuteronomie. For this cause moves not kings no more to the reading
of ye book of Deuteronomie then of any of the other books of Moses in
which as well as i^ ye book of Deuteronomie is plentiful store of godly lessons
and holy instruccio^s. Wherein to be devoutly occupied is a holy thing. Wherefore
that there was non other cause of this commandment, the^ for that ye laws
whereby the king of Israel is bound to rule his people, are more precisely
contained in ye book of Deutronomie, the^ in ye other books of ye old
testament, ye circumstances of the same commandment do manifestly infourme
us. For which cause you ought most worthy prince no less the^ the kings of
Israel to be moved and provoked to be a diligent trauailer in the study of
those laws, wherebye hereafter you shall rule your people. For that which was
spoken to the king of Israel must be understand to be figuratively spoken
to every king having dominion over godly people. And have I not then well and
holsomelye propounded unto you the commandment geeuen to the kings of
Israel concerning the learning of their law? Forasmuch as not only his
example, but also his like authority has taught you and bound you to the
like dooinge in the laws of the kyngedome, which god willinge you shall
inherit.

Here the Chauncelour proves that a prince by the laws may be made happy and
blessed. Cap. 4.
NOt only to the i^tent you should fear god and so beecome wise, do ye laws
with ye prophet call you saying: Come children hear me I will teach you ye
fear of the lord: but also that you may aspire unto felicity and blessedness
(as far fourth as in this life theye may be atteyned) do the laws will
you most gracious prince to be studious of them For all the philosophers
which have so diversely resoned of felicity, have all agreed together in this
o^e point, that felicity or blessedness is ye end of al ma^s desire: and
therefore theye call it chief goodness. Howbeit ye peripatetiks placed it in
virtue, the Stoikes i^ honesty, and the Epicures in pleasure. But seeing ye
Stoikes defined honesty to be that which is well and laudably done with
virtue, and the Epicures held nothing to be pleasant witheoute virtue,
therefore all those sects, as saiethe Leonarde Arretine in his Introduction to
moral Philosophy agreed in this, that it is only virtue that causethe
felicity. Wherefore Aristotle also in ye seventh book of his politiques
defining felicity, says that it is the perfect use of virtues. Thus much
being now presupposed I would have you to consider these things also ye follow
Ma^s laws are nothing else but certain rules, whereby Justice is perfectlye
taught. But that Justice which the laws do show is not the same that is called
Commutatiue or Distributive, or any other particular virtue, but it is a
perfect virtue expressed by the name of Justice legal. Which the foresaid
Leonerd does therefore affirm to be perfect, because it excludes all
vice, and teachethe all virtue. For which cause also it is woorthelye called
by the name of al virtue. Whereof Homere saiethe, and likewise Aristotle in the
fifthe book of Moral philosophy, that it is ye chiefest of al virtues, and
that neither Lucyfer nor Hesperus are so bright and beaming as it is. Moreover
this Justice is ye thing, whereupon al princelye care depends and rests:
witheoute the which the king can neither rightly judge, nor yet duly fight.
But this being once obtained and perfectly kept, then all the hole deuty
required in a king is justly performed. Now then seeing that the perfect
use of virtues is felicytie, and that Justice used amongst men which can
not be obtained unto nor learned but by the law, is not only the effect of
virtues, but is all virtue it self, hereof it folowethe, that the practiser of
Justice is by the law happy, and so thereby he is made blessed, forsomuche
as blessedness or happynes and felicity are both one in this short and
transitory life, of the which life through Justice he enjoys the chief
and principal goodness. And yet the law is not hable to perform these
things without the assistence of grace, witheoute the which also you can not
learn nor covet either law or virtue. For as says Pariss. in his book
entitled Cur deus homo the inward virtue of man wherein his desieringe is
placed is so through original sin defaced and corrupt, that it esteems
vicious works for pleasant, and virtuous works for unpleasant. Wherefore
in that some men apply and endeavor themselves to the love and following of
virtues, it proceedethe of the bountiful goodness of god and not of the power of
man. Is there not then special cause why the laws, which being prevented and
accompanied with grace do perform all the premises, should with all diligent
travail be learned? Saying that whosoever has perfectlye atteyned thereunto, the
same shall enjoy felicity, the end and performance, as ye Philosophers say,
of ma^s desire by mea^s whereof he shall in this life be blessed, in ye he now
possesses ye chief goodness thereof. Doubtless if these things move you not,
which shall have the rule and government of a kingdom, yet the words of the
prophet shall move you, yea and force you to the study of the law, which words
be these: Be ye learned you yt are judges of the earth. Here ye prophet
exhorts not to ye learni^g of a base art or a handycraft, for he says not:
Be ye learned you yt are the i^habiters of the earth, neither does he counsel
to the learning of knoweledge speculatiue, though it be not unnecessary for
the inhabiters upon the earth. For he sayethe not generally: Be ye learned
you that dwell upon the earth, but by these words, does the prophet call
kings only to the learning of the law, whereby judgments are executed,
for so much as he specially says Be ye learned you yt are judges of ye earth.
And it folowethe: least the lord wax angrye, and so you perish from the way
of righteousenes. Neither does holy scripture (o kings son) commau^d you
only to be skilfullye instruct in the laws, whereby you shall purchase and
obtein ye possession of justice but also i^ an other place it bids you
unfeignedly to love Justice, where it sayethe. O set your love and affection
upon Justice you that are judges of the earth, in the first chapter of the
book of wisdom.

NOn solu^ vt de u^ timeas, quo et sapie^s eris, princeps colendissime, voca^t

hec, subiectu^ est omnis regalis curae, quo sine illa Rex just non iudicat,

et Iusticia humana, que non nisi per lege^ perfect na^ciscitur, aut docetur,
nedum sit virtutum effectus, sed et omnis virtus. Sequitur quod iustitia fruens

felicitas in hac fugaci vita cuius et per iusticiam ipse summum habet bonu^
tamen no^ nisi per gratia^ lex poterit ista operari, neque legem aut virtutem

Ignorance of the law causith the contempt there of. Cap. 5.
But how can you love Justice, onles you first have a sufficient knoweledge in
the laws, whereby the knoweledge of it is won and had: For the Philosopher
saiethe that nothing can be loved except it be known. And therefore
Quintiliane the Oratoure sayethe, that happy should arts be, if artificers
only wear judges of them. As for that which is unknown it is wont not
only not to be loved, but also to be despised. And therefore a certain poet
thus says.

The plowma^ does desspise and skof,

the thing he is not skillful of.

And this is the saiynge not of plowemen alone but also of learned, and right
skillful men. For if unto a natural Philosopher yt never studied ye
mathematical sciences a supernatural Philosopher should say that this
science considerethe things severed from all matter and mouinge, according to
their substantial being and reason: or the Mathematical man should say
that this science considerethe things joined to matter and moving after their
substance but severed according to reason, both these though Philosophers, will
ye natural philosopher, which never understood things severed from mat^ and
motion either in being or in reason, utterly despise, and their sciences
though in deed more excelent then his, will he laughe to scorn, moved so
to do by none other cause, but that he is altogether ignoraunte in their
sciences. Likewise you most worthy prince would wonder at one skillful in the
laws of England, if he should say that the brother shall not succeed his half
brother in their fathers inheritance, but rather his enheritaunce shall
descend to the sister of the whole blood, or elz it shall be entitled to the
chief lord of the fee as his escheat: Herat you would much marueill, because
you know not the cause of this law. Howebeeit the difficulty of this case
nothing troubles him yt is learned in the laws of England. Wherefore it is a
commen saying, that an art has no foe but the ignorant person.

But god forbid O noble prince that you should be an enemy to the laws of
that royalme, which you shall by succession inherit: or that you should
despise them, seeing yt ye a fore cited text of scripture instructs you to
the love of Justice. Wherefore most sovereign Prince I do with most earnest
affection require you to learn the laws of your fathers kingdom, whom you
shall succeed, not only to the intent you may the rather avoid these
inconuenyences, but also because man's mind which naturally desires the
thing that is good, and can desire nothing, but in respects that it is good, as
soon as by learning it has taken hold of that which is good, it becomes
ioyefull, and loves the same: and the more that it is afterward occupied in
the remembrance of the same, so much it is more delited therein. Whereby you are
taught yt if you once by learning attain to ye understanding of ye foresaid
laws wherein you are now ignorant, seeinge they be perfectlye good, you
must needs love the^ And ye more yt you record the^ in your mi^de, so much ye
more delight and pleasure shall you have in them.

For what soever it is ye is loved, the same draws the lover of it into ye
nature thereof. So that as the Phisopher says, use or exercise becomes an
other nature. So a slip of a Pear tree being graffed into the stock of an
appletree, after that it has taken, it so draws the appletree into the
nature of the Peartree, ye they both for ever after are rightly called a
pearetree, and do bring forth the fruit of a pearetree. In like sort
continual use and practyse of virtue causes a full perfection thereof, in so
much that the practyser of the same is afterward named thereby: as a man endued
with modestye, of the use thereof is named modest. He that uses continencye is
called continent, and one garnished with wisdom is called wise. Wherefore you
also most mighty prince, when you are plesantly delyted in Justice, and
therewith endued, in respect of the perfeccion of the law you shall wortheli be
called Just. For which cause it shall be said unto you: Thou have loved Justice
and hated iniquity, and therefore the lord thy God has anointed the with ye
oil of gladness above the kings of the earth thy companions.

SEd quomo^ iusticiam diligere poteris, sinon primo legum scientia^ quibus ipsa
cognoscatur, vtcu^que apprehe^deris? Dicit namque Philosophus, quod nihil
amatu^ nisi cognitum. Quare Fabius Orator ait, qd' felices essent arts si de
illis soli artifices iudicarent. Ignotum vero no^ solum no^ amari, sed and
sperni solet. quo poeta quida^ sic ait: omnia que nescit, dicit sperne^ da
colonus. Et no^ coloni solum vox hec est sed et doctorum peritissimorum quoque
viroru^ Na^ si ad Philosophum natural' qui in mathe. nunqua^ studuit,
methaphisicus dicat qd' scientia sua considerat resseperatas ab o^ni materia et
motu scd'm esse et secu^du^ ratione^: Vel mathemathecus dicat, quod sua
scientia considerat res coniunctas materi^ae, et motui secundum esse sed
seperatas secundum rationem. Ambos hos licet pho^s, philosophus ille naturalis
qui nu^qua^ nouit res aliquas seperatas a materia and motu essentia vel ratione
spernet eorumque sciencias, licet sua scientia nobili ores ipse deridebit, non
alia ductus causa, nisi quia eorum scientias ipse penitus ignorant. Sic et tu
princeps legis Anglie peritu^ miraberis, si dicat quod frater fratri sibi
nequaqua^ vterino, non succedet in hereditate paterna, sed potius hereditas
illa, soro ri integri sanguinis sui descendet. Aut capitali domino feodi
accidet vt escaeta sua. Cu^ causam legis huius tu ignores, in lege tamen
Angliae doctu^, huius casus difficultas nullatenus perturbat.

Quare et vulgariterdicitur: quod ars non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem.

Sed absit a te, fili Regis, vt inimiceris legibus regni quo tu successurus es,
vel vt eas spernes cum iusticiam diligere, predicta sapientiae lectio te
erudiat Iterum igitur atque iterum, princeps inclitissime, te adiuro vt leges
regni patris tui, cui successurus es addiscas.

Ne dum vt inconuenie^tias has tu euites: Sed quia men's humana, quae
naturaliter bonum appetit, et nihil potest appetere, nisi sub ratione boni, mox
vt per doctrinam bonum apprehe^derit, guadet et illud amat, ac quanto deinceps
illud plus recordatur, tanto amplius delectatur i^ eodem. quo doceris quod si
leges predictas quas iam ignoras intellexeris per doctrinam, cum optimae illae
sint, amabis eas. Et qua^to plus easdem mente pertractaueris, tanto eisdem
delectabilius tu frueris.

Nam omne quod amatur, vsu trahit amatorem suum in naturani eius. Vnde vt dicit
Philosophus vsus altera fit natura, sic ramunculus piri, stipiti pomi insertus,
postquam coaluerit, ita pomum trahit in naturam piri, vt ambae deinceps merito
pirus appellentur, fructusque producant piri. Sic et vsitata virtus habitum
generat, vt vtens ea deinde a virtute illa denominetur, quo modestiae preditus,
vsu modestus nominatur, contine^tiae, continens, et sapientiae sapiens. Quare
et tu princeps, postquam iustitia delectabiliter functus fueris, habitumque
legis indutus fueris merito denominaberis iustus, cuius gratia tibi dicetur:
dilexisti iusticiam, quo et odisti iniquitatem, propterea vnxit te dominus deus
tuus oleo letitiae pre consortibus tuis regibus terrae.

Here the Chancellor briefly repeteth the effect of all his perswacion. Cap.
6.
NOw most gracious prince is not all this enoughe to move your highness to the
study of ye law? Seeing that thereby you shall indue your self with Justice,
which shall yield unto you the name of a just man. And shall also eschew the
infamy of ignorance in the law. And further by the law you enjoying
felicity, shall be blessed in this life. And finallye being furnished with a
loving fear, which is the wisdom of God, you shall obtain and possess
Charity, which is a steadfast love to godward, and by the mean thereof
cleanynge to God, you shall by the apostles saying be made one Spirit with
him.

But forsomuche as the law without grace cannot accomplish these things it is
necessary and requisite that above all things you make earneste intercession
for it: and also yt you beecome a studious sercher of gods law, and of the
holy scripture.

For scripture says that all men are vain in who^ is not ye knowledge of god
in the xiii. chapter of the book of wisdom.

Wherefore most noble prince while you are yet young, and while your soul is
as it were a smoothe blanke table, write in it these things, lest hereafter
you happen to take pleasure in writi^g lesso^s of less profit therein.

For as a certain wise man says, Whereof the vessel new, did first receue
the taste:

Therein when it is old, the sent will ever last.

What handycrastes man does so negligentlye regard ye profit of his child
who^e while he is young, he will not see brought up in such an occupacion, as
thereby he may afterward obtain to lead a merry life. So the carpenter
teaches his son to cut with an axe: ye smyth his to stryke with an hammer:
and whom he entendethe to make a spiritual minister, him he procures to be
trained up in learning. So likewise is it convenient yt a kings son which
shall govern the people after his father be in his youth instructed in the
laws.

Which order if the ruelers of the world would observe, then the world
should be governed with much more Justice then now it is. Unto whom if you
will follow mine exhortacion, you shall minister no small example.

NOnne tunc Princeps se renissime, hec te satis concitant, ad legis rudimenta:
cu^ per ea, iustitia^ induere valeas: quo et appellaberis iustus, ignorantiae
quoque legis euitare poteris ignominiam: ac per legem felicitate fruens, beatus
esse poteris in hac vita, et demum filiali timore indutus, qui dei sapientia
est, charitatem quae amor in deu^ est imperturbatus consequeris, qua deo
adherens, per Apostoli sententiam, fies vnus spiritus cum eo.

Sed quia ista, sine gratia lex operari nequit, tibi illam super omnia
implorare necesse est, legis quoque diuinae et sanctarum scripturarum indagare
scientiam. Cum dicat scriptura sacra: quod vani sunt omnes in quibus non subest
scientia dei. Sapienciae cap. xiij. His igitur princeps, dum adolescens es, et
anima tua velut tabula rasa, depinge eam, ne in futurum, ipsa figuris minoris
frugi delectabilius depingatur.

Quia etiam (vt sapiens quidam ait) quod noua testa capit, inueterata sapit.
Quis artifex tam neglige^s profectus suae prolis est, vt no^ ea^ dum pubescit
artibus instruat, quibus postea vitae solatia nanciscatur? Sic lignarius faber
secare dolabro, ferrarius ferire malleo, filiu^ instruit: et que^ in
spiritualibus ministrar' cupit, literis imbui facit. Sic et principi filium
suum qui post eum populu^ regulabit, legibus instrui du^ minor est conuenit,
qualiter si feceri^t rectores orbis, mundus iste ampliori quam iam est iustitia
regeretur, quibus si tu vt iam hortor facias, exemplum non minimum ministrabis.

Now the Prince yeldeth himself to the study of the laws, though he be yet
disquieted with certain doubts. Ca. 7.
THus when the Chau^cellour had said, he held his peace, to whom the Prince
began on this wise to speak. You have overcome me welbe loved Chancellor
with your most pleasant talk, wherwt you have i^flamed my mind with a fervent
desire toward the knowledge of the law. Howbee it ii. things there be that
do toss my mind to and fro, and so disquiet it, that like a ship in the
raging waves, it knows not which way to inclyne for ease. The one is, while
it consydereth how many years the students of the lawez bestow therein
before they can attain to sufficient knowledge of the same. Which causes my
mind also to dread least that I should likewise spend the years of my
youth.

The other is whether I shall apply my self to the study of the laws of
England, or of the Civil laws, which through out the whole world are chieflye
esteemed: For people may not be governed but by right good laws, and as the
Philosophier says, nature coueteth that which is best. Wherefore I would
gladlye hear your council in this behalf. To whom the Chancellor made
this answer. These matters, O Kings son, are not hid under so deep and
dark mysteries, that they require any great delyberacyon, or aduysement.

And therefore what I think best hearein I will not hyde.

SIlente extunc Cancellario, Princeps ipse sic exorsus est. Vicisti me, vir
egregie, suauissima oratione tua, qua et animum meum, ardore non minimo legis
fecisti sitire documenta. Sed tame^ duobus, me huc illucque, agitantibus,
animus ipse affligitur: vt tanquam in turbido mari cimba, nesciat quorsum
dirigere proras. Vnu^ est dum recolit quot annoru^ curriculis leges ad
discentes, earum studio se conferunt, antequam sufficientem earundem peritiam
nancisca^tur: quo timet animus ipse, ne consimiliter ego preteream animos
iuuentutis meae. Alterum est, an Angliae Legum vel Ciuilium quae per orbem
percelebres sunt, studio operam dabo.

Nam non nisi optimis legibus populum regere licet, etiam vt dicit Philosophus,
natura deprecatur optima, quare libenter super his, quid tu consulis
ascultaremus.

Cui Cancellarius Non sunt hec, fili Regis, tantis celata misteriis, vt
deliberatione ege ant ingenti, quare quid in his mihi visum est prodere non
differemus.

So much knowledge of the law as is necessary for a Prince, is soon had.
Cha. 8.
ARistotle in the first book of his natural Philosophy says, ye then we
suppose our selves to have the knowledge of every thing, when we know the
causes and beginninges thereof even to the principles, upon the which text the
comentatour says that the philosopher by beginninges or principles did
understand the causes efficient, by ye term Causes he understood causes
final, and by Elements matter and form. But in the law there are no matter
and form, as in things natural, and compounde.

How beit there be in them certain Elements, out of the which they proceed as
out of matter and fourm. These are custo^s, statuts and the law of nature: of
ye which all the ^awes of the roialme have their beginning, even as all natural
things have of matter and form, and as all things that are written and read
do consist of letters, which also are called elements. But Principles, or
beeginninges, which are as the commentarye says, causes efficient, they are
certain universal propositions, which they that be learned in the laws of
England and likewise ye Mathematicals do term Maxims: the Rethoricians do
call the same Paradoxes: and the Ciuilia^s term the^ rueles of the law. These
in deed cannot be proved by force of arguments, or by demo^stracions
logical, but as it is said in the second book of Posterior^, they are
known by induction by the way of sense and memory. Wherefore in the first
book of his natural Philosophye Aristotle says that principles are not made
of others, nor one of them of an other, but all other be made of them. And
according thereunto in the first book of his Topikes he writes, that every
principle is a sufficient proof of it self.

And therefore the Philosopher says that such as deny them ought not to be
disputed or reasoned withal: because that as he writes in the sixthe book
of his moral Philosophy, there is no reason to be given for principlez
Wherefore whosoever they be that covet to profit in ye knowledge of any
faculties, they must nedez first be furnished with principles. For by them are
opened the causes final, unto the which by the direction of reason through the
knowledge of ye principles we do attain.

wherefore these iii. vz pri^ciples, causes, and elem^tz being unknown, the
science whereof they are is altogether unknown And the same.iii. beeinge
known, the science also whereof they are is thought to be known, not
determinatly or p^cisely, but superficially after a co^fuse and universal
sort.

Thus we think our selves to have the knowledge of godds laws, when we
understand our selves to know faith charity, and hope, and also the
Sacraments of the church, and the commandments of God, leaving to the
prelates of the Church the other mysteries of theologye.

Wherefore the lord says unto his disciples: To you it is geeuen to know the
mystery of the kingdom of God, but to other in Parables, that seeing they
may not see. And the Apostle says: Not to be wyser then it beehoueth.

And in another place.

Not beeinge high in wisdom. In like manner O most worthy Prince, it shall
not be needful for you with long study to search out the secret mysteries
of the law of England. It shall suffice for you as you have profited in
grammar, so also to profit in law.

Unto the perfection of grammar springinge out of Etimologie, Orthographie,
Prosodie, and Construction as out of.iiii. fountains, you have not exactlye
attained, and yet you are so sufficiently grounded in grammar that you may well
be called a Gramarrien. Likewise shall you be well worthy to be called a lawier,
if you search out ye pri^ciplz and causes of ye laws even to ye elementz after
ye manner of a scholar or a learner. For it shall not be needful or expedient
for you by the travel of your own wit to study out the hid mysteries of
ye law. But let ye gear be left to your judges and me^ of law, which in
the royalme of England are called Seriauntz at law and to other professors
of the law comme^ly called apprentices. For you shall better execute
judgments by other, then by your self. Neither has it been see^e that any
king of England has pronounced judgment with his own mouth. And yet
nevertheless all the judgments of the royalme are his, though by other they
be uttered and pronounced. Like as also king Iosaphat affirmed the sentences
of all the judges to be the judgments of god. Wherefore most gracious prince
you shall in short time with little labor be sufficiently learned in the
laws of England, so that you do apply your mind to the obteynynge thereof For
Seneca in an epistle to Lucillus sayethe: There is nothi^ge which earnest
traueill and diligent care atchieueth not And so well do I know the prompte
towardnes of your nature, y^ I dare be bold to say, that in those laws
(though the exact knowelege of the^ such as is required i^ judges can skante
be gotten in the space of xx. years) you shall sufficiently in one year
attain to somuche understanding, as is convenient for a prince Neither in the
mea^e time shall you neglect and omit the study of martial discipline,
whereunto you are so fervently given, but during all the same year in stead
of recreatio^ you shall use the practice thereof of at your pleasure.

Philosophus in primo Phisicorum dicit, quod tunc vnumquodque scire arbitramur,
cum causas et principia eius cognoscamus vsque ad elementa. Super quem textum
co^mentator dicit qd' Aristotus per principia intellexit causas efficientes,
per causas intellexit causas finales, et per eleme^ta materiam et formam. In
legibus vero non sunt materia et forma, vt in Phisicis et compositis. Sed tamen
sunt in eis eleme^ta quaedam, vnde ipsae profluu^t, vt ex materia et forma,
quae sunt consuetudines, statuta, et ius naturae, ex quibus sunt omnia iura
regni, vt ex materia et forma sunt quaeque naturalia: et vt ex litteris, quae
etiam elementa appellantur, sunt omnia quae leguntur.

Principia autem, quae commentator dicit esse causas efficientes, su^t quaedam
vniuersalia, quae in legibus Angliae docti, similiter et Mathematici, maximas
vocant: Rethorici, paradoxas: and Ciuilistae, regulas iuris denomina^t: ipsa
reuera non argume^torum vi, aut demonstrationibus logicis dinoscuntur. Sed, vt
secundo posteriorum docetur inductione, via sensus, et memoriae adipiscuntur,
quare et primo phisicorum philosophus dicit: qd' principia non fiunt ex aliis,
neque ex alterutris, sed ex illis alia fiunt; quo primo topicorum scribitur,
quod vnu^quodque principiorum est sibi ipsi fides. Vnde, cum negantibus ea,
dicit philosophus non est disputandum: quia, vt scribitur vi. Ethicorum. ad
Principia non est ratio.

Igitur principiis imbuendi sunt, quiqui gliscunt aliquas intelligere
facultates. Ex eis etenim, reuelantur causae finales, ad quas rationis ductu,
per principiorum agnitionem peruenitur, vnde his tribus, videlicet principijs,
causis, et elementis ignoratis scientia de qua ipsa sunt, penitus ignoratur. Et
his cognitis, etiam scientiam illam cognitam esse, non determinate, sed
inconfuso et vniuersaliter arbi^tratur.

Sic Legem diuinam nos nosse in dicamus, dum fidem, charitatem et spem,
sacrame^ta quoque ecclesiae, ac dei mandata nos intelligere se^tiamus, cetera
theologiae misteria ecclesiae presidentibus relinquentes. Quare dominus
discipulis suis ait. Vobis datum est nosse misterium regni dei, ceteris autem
in parabolis, vt videntes non videant etc. Et Apostolus dixit, non plus sapere
quam oportet sapere, and alibi non alta sapie^tes. Sic et tibi pri^ceps necesse
non erit (...) misteria legis angliae longo disciplinatu rimare, sufficient
tibi vt i^ gramatica tu profecisti, etia^ and in legibus proficias. Gramaticae
vero perfectionem que ex Ethimologia, Ortographia, Prosodia, et Syntaxi, quasi
ex quatuor fontibus profluit, non specie tenus induisti, et tamen gramatica
sufficienter eruditus es, ita vt merito gramaticus denominoris. Consimiliter
quoque denomi^ari legista mereberis, si legum pri^cipia, et causas, vsq^ ad
^limenta, discipuli more indagaueris No^ eni^ expediet tibi propria sensus
indagine legis sacramenta rimar^ sed relinqua^tur illa iudicibus tuis et
aduocatis, qui in regno Angliae, seruientes ad legem appella^tur, similiter et
aliis iuris peritis, quos apprenti^cios vulgus denominat, Melius eni^ per
alios, qua^ per te ipsum iuditia reddes, quo proprio ore nullus regum Angliae
iudicium proferre visus e^, et tame^ sua sunt o^nia iudicia regni licet per
alios ipsa redda^tur, sicut et Iudicum oi^m sententias Iosaphat asseruit esse
iuditia dei.

Quare tu pri^ceps serenissime paruo tempore, parua industria, sufficienter
eris in legibus regni Angliae eruditus, dummodo ad eius apprehentionem tu
conferas animum tuu^. Dicit namque Seneca in epistola ad Lucillum. Nil est quod
pertinax opera et diligens cura non expugnat. Nosco namque ingenii tui
perspicacitate^, quo audact' pronuncio, quoth. in legibus illis licet earu^
peritia qualis, iudicibus necessaria est, vix viginti annorum lugubris
adquiratur, tu doctrinam principi congrua^ in anno vno sufficienter
nancisceris, nec i^terim militarem disciplina^ ad quam tam arde^t' anhelas
negliges, sed ea recreationis loco, etiam anno illo tu ad libitum perfrueris.

A King whose government is politic ea^ not change the laws of his
royalme.
THe second point, most worthy prince, whereof you stand in fear shall i^
like manner, and as easeli as the other be confuted. For you stand in doubt
whether it be bett^ for you to give your mind to ye study of the laws of
England, or of the Civil laws, because they through out ye whole world are
aua^ced in glory and renown above all other ma^s laws. Let not this scruple
of mind trouble you, O most noble prince. For ye king of England can not
alter nor change the laws of his royalme at his pleasure. For why he governs
his people by power not only roial but also politic. If his power over the^
were royal only then he might change ye laws of his royalme, and charg his
subiectz with tallag. and other burdenz without their co^se^t. And such is the
dominion that the civil laws purport when they say: The pri^ceis pleasure
has ye force of a law. But from this much differs ye power of a king,
whose government over his people is politic. For he can neither change laws
with out the consent of his subiectz, nor yett charge the^ with strange
imposicions against their wylles Wherefore his people do frankely and freely
enjoy and occupye their own goodz being rueled by such laws as yey the^
selfz desyer. Neither are they pylled either of yeir own king or of any
other. Lyk pleasur also and fredo^ have ye subjects of a King ruli^g only by
power roial so long as he falls not in to tyranny Of such a king speaks
Aristotle in the third book of his Civil philosophy, saieynge that it is
better for a City to be governed by a good king then by a good law. But
forsomuche as a ki^ge is not ever such a man, therefore Saint Thomas i^ ye
book which he wrote to ye king of Cyprus of the governance of princeis
wishes ye state of a roialme to be such, yt it may not be in the kings power
too oppress his people with tyranny. Which thing is performed only while
the power royal is restrained by power politic. Rejoice therefore O
sovereign prince, and be glad, that the law of your royalme, wherei^ you
shall succeed, is such For it shall exhibit and minister to you and your
people no small security and comfort. with such laws as says the same
Saint Thomas should all mankind have been governed, if in paradise they had
not transgressed gods commandment, with such laws also was the Synnagoge
rueled, whil it served under god only as ki^ge, who adopted the sa^e to him
for a peculiar kyngdo^e. But at the last when at their request they had a man
king set over them, they were then under royal laws only brought very
low. And yett under the sa^e laws while good kings were yeir rulers, they
lived welthely and when wilful and tyranous kings had the government of
them, the^ they continued in great discomfort and misery, as the book of
kings does more plainly declare. But for so much as I suppose I have
sufficiently debated this matter in my work, which at your request I co^piled
of ye nature of ye law of Nature, therefore at this ti^e I surceasse to speak
thereof any more

SEcundum vero Pri^ceps quoth* tu formidas conconsimili nec maiori opera elidetur.

Here the prince demau^deth a question. Cap. 10.
Immediately the prince thus said. How comes this to pass good Chancellor,
that o^e king may govern his people by power royal only, and ye an other
king ca^ have no such power, sei^g both this kings are i^ dignity equal I
cannot chose but much muse and marueil why i^ power they should thus differ.

TVnc princeps illico sic ait. Vnde hoc ca^cellarie, quoth Rex vnus plebem sua^
regaliter ta^tu^ regere valeat, et regi alteri potestas huiusmodi denegatur.

nequeo no^ admirari,

The answer to this question is here omitted for that in another work it is
handeled at large. Cap. 11.
I have sufficiently, quoth the chau^cellour, declared in my foresaid work, yt
the King whose government is politic, is of no less power then he that
royally ruelethe his people after his own pleasure howbeit they differ i^
authority over their subiets, as in the sa^e work I have showed, and say I
still. Of which difference I will open unto you the cause as I can.

How Kingedomes rueled by royal government only, first began. Cap. 12.
Men i^ times passed excellynge in power, gredie of dignity and glory did
many times by plai^e force subdue unto them their neighbors the nations
adioynyng: and compelled them to do the^ service and to obey their
commandments, which co^maundeme^tz afterward they decreed too be unto those
people very laws And by long sufferau^ce of the sa^e ye people so subdued,
being by their subduers defended from the injuries of other agreed and
consented to live under the dominion of the same their subduers thi^ki^ge it
better for the^ to be under ye e^piere of o^e man which might be hable to
defend the^ against other the^ to be i^ danger to be opp^ssed of all such as
would viole^tli offer them any wrong. And thus certain kingedo^es were
begone. And those subduers thus ruli^g ye people unto the^ subdued, took upon
the^ of rueli^ge to be called Rulers, which our language termethe kings And
their ruele or dominion was named only royal or kingly. So Nemroth was the
first yt got unto himself a kingedo^e And yett i^ the holy scripturs he is
not called a ki^ge, but a stout or mighty hu^ter before ye lord For like as a
hu^ter subdueth wyld beasts lyui^ge at their liberty, so did he bri^ge me^
under his obedient. So did Belus subdue ye Assyrians, and Ninus the most perte
of Asia. So also did the Romans usurp the empier of the whole world. And
thus almost were the ki^gdo^es of all nations begone Wherefore the lord
being displeased with the children of Israel requieri^ge to have a King as
then all other nations had commanded the law regal to be declared unto the^
by ye prophett Which law regal was no other thing, but the pleasure of the
king their governor: as in the first book of the kings more fully it is
contained. Now you understand as I suppose most noble prince, the form and
fassion of the beginning of those Kyngedomes that be regally possessed and
rueled. Wherefore now I will assaye to make plai^e unto you how and by what
mea^es ye government of the Kingdom politic took his first entrance and
begynynge to the end and intent ye when you know the begynnynges of them both
it may be right easy for you thereby too discern the cause of the diversity
which in your question is contained.

How Kyngedomes of politic governance were first begone. Cap. 13.
SAint Auste^ i^ ye xxiii. chapter of his xix. book De ciuitate dei says ye a
People is a multitude of men associated by the consent of law, and communion
of wealth. And yett such a people being headless that is to say without a
head, is not worthy to be called a body. For as in things natural when the
head is cut of the residue is not called a body, but a truncheon, so
likewise in things politic a cominalte without a head is in no wise corporate.
Wherefore Aristotle i^ the first book of his civil philosophy says ye
whensoever o^e is made of many, among ye sa^e one shall be the rueler, and the
other shall be rueled. wherefore a people that will raise the^selfs into a
kingdom, or into any other body politic must ever appointe one to be chief
rueler of the whole body which in ki^gdo^es is called a ki^ge After this ki^de
of order, as out of the embryo^ rieseth a body natural ruled by o^e head, even
so of a multitude of people arieseth a kyngedo^e which is a body mistical
gou^ned by o^e man as by an head. And like as in a natural body, as says the
Philosopher, the heart is ye first ye lives, hauig wtin it blood, which it
distributeth among all ye other members, whereby they are quickened and do
live: se^blably in a body politik ye intent of ye people is the first lively
thing, having wtin it blood, yt is to say, politic provision for the utility
and wealth of the same people, which it deals forth and imparteth as well to the
head as to al ye members of the same body whereby ye body is nourished and
maintained. Furthermore the law under the which a multitude of men is made a
people, represents the se^blance of synews i^ ye body natural Because that
like as by synewes the ioynyng of the body is made sound so by the law which
takes the name a ligando yt is to wit of byndynge such a mystical body is
knytt and preserved together. And the members and bones of the same body
whereby is represented ye soundenes of the wealth whereby that body is
sustained, do by the laws as the natural body by synewes reteyne eueryone
their proper fu^ctions And as the head of a bodi natural ca^ not change his
sinews, nor ca^ not deny or witholde from his inferior members their
peculiar powers, and several nourishm^tz of blood, no more ca^ a ki^ge which is
ye head of a body politik change the laws of ye body nor withdraw from the
same people their proper substance against their wills and consentes in that
behalf. Now you understand most noble prince the form of institucion of a
ki^gdome politic, wherebye you may measure the power, which the king thereof
may exercise over the law and subjects of the same. For such a king is made
and ordained for ye defense of the law of his subjects and of their bodies
and goods, whereunto he receaueth power of his people, so yt he can not
govern his people by any other power. Wherefore to satisfy your request in yt
you desire to be certified how it comes to pas that in ye powers of kings
there is so great diversity, suerly in mine opinion the diversity of the
institutio^z or first ordinances of those dignities which I have now
declared, is the only cause of this foresaid difference, as of the premises
by the discourse of reason you may easelye gather. For thus ye kingdom of
England out of Brutes retinue of the Trojans which he brought out of the
coasts of Italy and Greece, first grew to a politic and regal dominion.
Thus also Scotland which sometime was subject to England as a Dukedom thereof
was aduau^ced to a politik and royal kingdom. Many other ki^gdo^s also had
thus their first begi^ninge not only of regal but also of politic
government Wherefore Diodorus Siculus in his second book of old histories
thus writes of the Egiptia^s. The Egiptien kings lived first not after ye
licentious manner of other rulers, whose will and pleasure is in steed of law,
but they kept themselves as private persons in subjection of the laws And
this did they willingly, being persuaded that by obeyinge the laws they should
be blessed. For of such rulers as followed their own lusts they supposed
many things to be done, whereby they were brought in danger of diverse harms
and perils And in his fowerth book thus he writethe. The Ethiopian king as soon as he is created, he orders his life according to ye laws and does al
things after ye manner and custom of his country, assigninge neither reward
nor punishment to any man otherthen the law made by his predecessors
appointethe He reportethe likewise of the king of Saba in Arabia the happy,
and of certain other kings, which in old time honorablye reigned.

SAnctus Augustinus in libro xix de ciuitate dei capitulo xxiii. dicit: Quod
populus e^cetus hominu^ iuris consensu et vtilitatis co^munione sociatus. Nec
tame^ populus huiusmodi dum Acephelus (id est) sine capite est, corpus vocare
meretur. Quia vt in naturalibus, capite detruncato, residuu^ no^ corpus, sed

veritatis qua co^munitas illa sustentatur soliditate^ denota^t, per legem, vt

Here the prince compe^diously abbridgeth all that the Chau^celour before has
discoursed at large. ca. 14
TO whom the prince thus answered. You have good Chau^celloure with ye clear
light of your declaration quite driven away ye cloudy mist, wherewith the
brightness of my mind was darkened: so that I do most evidently see that no
nation did ever of their own voluntary mind in corporat themselfes into a
kingedome for any other intent, but only to the end that thereby theye might
with more safety then before maintain themselfs and enjoy their goods from
such misfortunes and losses as theye stood in fear of. And of this intent
should such a nation be utterly defrauded, if then their king might spoil
them of their goods, which before was lawefull for no man to do. And yet
should such a people be much more injured, if they should afterward be
governed bye foreyne and strange laws, yea and such as they paradue^ture
deadly hated and abhorred. And most of all if by those laws their substance
should be diminished, for the safegarde whereof, as also for the defense of
their own bodies they of their own free will submitted themselfes to the
governance of a king No such power suerlye could have proceeded from them.
And yet if theye had not been, such a king could have had noe power over
them. Now on the other side I perceive it to stand much otherwise with a
kingedome which only by the auctoritye of a king is incorporate, For such a
nation is no otherwise subject unto him, but that the same nation, which by
his pleasure is made his kingdom, should obey his laws, and be ruled by ye
same being nothing else but his like pleasure. Neither have I yet good
Chau^cellour forgoten that, which in your treatise of the nature of the law of
nature you have with pithie reasons clerklye proved, concerning that the power
of these.ij. kings is equal. Howebeit the power of ye one, whereby he is at
liberty to deal wrongfully is not by such liberty augmented and increased.
As to be of ability to decay and die is no hability, but in respect of the
privation and feebleness in the thing it is rather to be called a dishabilitie.
Because that as Boethius says: ability and power is not but to good. So y^
to be of ability or power to do evil (as is the king that regaly does
rule, and that with much more liberty, then the king yt has a politic
dominion over his people) is rather a diminution then an increase of power For
the holy spirits which are now established in glory and can not si^ne do
in power far excel and pass us, which have a delight and pleasure to run
headlonge into all kind of wickedness. Now therefore I have but this one only
question to demand of you, whether the law of England to the study whereof
you exhort me, be as good and effectual for the government of that kingdom,
as ye Civil law, wherebye ye holy e^pire is governed, is thought sufficient
for ye gouernemente of ye whole world? If with sound reasons, and apparaunte
demonstrations you resolve me in this point, I will streighte yield me to the
study of the law, wytheout further troubling you with my questions in this
matter.

CVi princeps. Effugasti Ca^cell^rie, declarationis tuae lumine tenebras quibus
obducra erat acies mentis meae, quo clarissime ia^ conspicio, quod non
aliopacto gens aliqua proprio arbitrio vnquam se in regnum corporauit, nisi vt
per hoc, se et sua quorum dispendia for midabant, tutius quam antea
possiderent, quasi proposito gens huiusmodi frauderet', si ex inde facultates
eorum eripere possit rex suus, quod antea facere vlli hominum non licebat. Et
ad huc grauius multo populus talis lederetur, si deinde peregrinis legibus
etiam ipsis forsan exosis, regerentur.

Et maxim si legibus illis eorum minoraretur substantia, pro cuius vita^da
iactura, vt pro suorum tutela corporu^, ipsi se regis i^perio, arbitrio proprio
submiserunt. Non potuit reuera potestas hm^odi ab ipsis erupisse, et tamen si
non ab ipsis, rex huiusmodi super ipsos nulla^ optineret potestate^, e regione
aliter esse co^cipio, de regno quod regis solu^ auctoritate et potentia

legibus, q^ su^t illius placita, ge^s ip^a q^ eode^ placito regnu^ eius effecta
est, obte^peraret et regenet'. Neque Ca^cellarie, a mea huc usque memoria
elapsu^ est, qd' alias in tractatu de natura legis naturae, horu^ duoru^ regu^
equale^ esse pote^tia^, doctis rationibus oste^disti, dum potestas qua eoru^
alter perpera^ agere liber e^, liberate huiusmodi no^ augetur, vt posse
lauguescere, moriue potentia non est sed propter priuationes in adiecto,
impotentia potius denominandum. Quia vt dicit Boethius potentia non est nisi ad
bonum, quoth* posse male agere, vt potest rex regaliter regnans, liberius quam rex
politice dominans populosuo, potius eius potestate^ minuit, quam augme^tat. Nam
sancti spiritus iam confirmati in gloria, qui peccare nequeunt potentiores
nobis sunt, qui ad omne facinus liberis gaudemus habenis. Solum igitur mihi iam
superest a te sciscitandum, si lex Angliae ad cuius disciplinatum me prouocas,
bona et efficax est ad regimen regni illius vt lex ciuilis, qua sacrum
regulatur imperium, sufficiens arbitrat' ad orbis regime^ vniuersi. Si me i^
hoc demo^strationibus congruis indubiu^ reddideris, ad studiu^ legis illius
illico me conferam, nec te postulationibus meis super his, aplius fatigabo.

That all laws are the law of nature, customs or statutes. Cap. 15.
THe Chauncelour answered saying. You have well committed to memory most
worthy prince all that I have hitherto declared unto you. Wherefore you are well
worthy to have this doubt opened whereupon now you have moved your question.
You shall therefore understand yt al humayne laws are either the law of nature,
or customs, or else statuts, which are also called co^stitutions. But
customs and ye sentences of the law of nature after that they were once put
i^ writing, and by ye sufficient authority of ye prince published and
commanded to be kept, were changed i^to ye nature of co^stitutions, or
statuts, and did after that more penally, then before bind the subjects of
the prince to the keepinge of the^ by the seueritye of his commandment. Of
this sort are the most part of the Civil laws, which of the Romain princes
are digested in great volumes and by their authority commanded to be
observed. And not theye only are called by ye name of ye Civil law, but also
all the other statutes of e^perours. Now then if that among these.iij.
welsprings of all law I prove the preeminence of the law of England to excel
above ye rest I shall therewith prove the same law to be good and effectual for
the government of ye kingedome. And further if I do show it to be as
commodious for the wealth of that Royalme as the Civil laws are for the
wealth of the empire, then shall I make evident and plain not only that this
law is of much excellencye, but also that it is an elect and chosen law,
as well as the Civil laws are: which is ye thing yt you require Wherefore to
the proof and declaracion of these.ij. poi^ts thus I proceed.

CAncellarius memoriae tuae princeps optime commendasti quae tibi hucusque

The law of nature in all countries is al one. Cap. 16
The laws of England in those things which they by force of the law of nature
do ratify and establish are neither better nor worse in their judgments the^
ye laws of al other nations are in ye like cases. For as Aristotle in ye fifth
book of his moral philosophy says. The law of nature is yt which among al
people has like strength and power Wherefore hereof to reason any longer it
shall not avail. But now hencefurth we will search out what manner of
custo^es and statutz these of England ar And first the qualytie of those
customs we will consider.

LEges Angliae, i^ his q^ ip^ae sa^ctiu^t legis naturae ratio^e, non meliores
peioresue sunt in iudiciis suis, qua^ in co^similibus su^t o^nes leges
ceteraru^ nationu^. Quia vt dicit Phu^s. v. Ethicoru^. Ius natural est quod
apud omnes homines ea^de^ he^t potentiam, quare de ea a^plius disceptare no^
expeditur. Sed quales su^t Angliae co^suetudines sl'er et statuta est amodo
perscruta^du^ et primo co^suetudinu^ illaru^ visitab^mus qualitates.

The customs of England are of most ancient a^tiquitie, practiced and
received of v. several nations from one to an other by succession. Cap. 17
THe roialme of England was first inhabited of ye Brito^s. Next after the^ ye
Romans had ye rule of ye land. And the^ again ye Brito^s possessed it. After
who^ the Saxons invaded it, who chau^ging ye name thereof did for Britain call
it England. After the^ for a certain time the Danes had the dominion of the
Roialme, and the^ Saxons again. But last of all the Normans subdued it, whose
descent continuethe in ye government of ye kingdom at this present. And in all
ye times of these several nations and of their kings this roialme was still
ruled with the self same customs that it is now governed witheall. Which
if theye had not been right good, some of those kings moved either with
Justice or with reason, or affection would have changed them, or else
altogether abolished the^: and specially the Romai^s who did judge all the rest
of the world by their own laws. Likewise would other of the foresaid kings
have done which bye the sword only possessing the royalme of England
might by the like power and auctoritye have extinguisshed the laws thereof.
And touching the antyquitie of the same neither are the Roman Civil laws
by so long contynuaunce of ancient times confirmed nor yet the laws of the
venetians, which above al other are reported to be of most antiquity:
for so much as their Island in the beginning of the Britones was not then
inhabited, as Room then also vnbuilded: neither the laws of any patnime
nation of the world are of so old and ancient years. Wherefore the contrary
is not to be said nor thought, but that the English customs are very good,
yea of all other the very best.

REgnu^ Angliae primo per Britones i^habitatum est, deinde per Romanos
regulatum iteru^que per Britones, ac dei^de per Saxones possessu^, qui nomen
eius ex Brita^nia in Angliam mutaueru^t: ex tu^c per Danos ide^ regnu^ paru^

valuerunt. Neque vero tantorum temporu^ curriculis, leges Ciuiles in qua^tum
Romanorum inueteratae sunt, neque venetoru^ leges quae super alias antiquitate
diuulgantur quoru^tum insula in initio Britonum inhabitata non fuit, sicut nec
Roma co^dita, nec vllorum mundi regnorum deicolarum leges tanto aeuo inolitae
sunt, quare non bonas, immo non optimas esse anglorum consuetudines, sicut non
dicere, ita nec suspicari fas est.

Here he shows with what gravity statuts are made in England. Cap. 18.
NOw whether the statuts of England be good or not, that only remainethe to
be discussed. For they proceed not only from the princes pleasure as do the
laws of those kingdoms that are ruled only by regal government, where
sometimes ye statuts do so procure the singular commodity of the maker, that
theye redounde to the hinderaunce and damage of his subjects. Sometimes also
by the negligence, and oversight of such princes, and their sleighte regard,
respecting only their own commodities they are so unadvisedly made, that they
are more worthy to have the name of disorders, then of well ordered laws. But
statutes cannot thus pass in England, for so much as they are made not only by
the Princes pleasure, but also by the asse^t of the whole royalme: so that of
necessity they must procure the wealth of the people, and in noe wise tend to
their hynderaunce. And it cannot otherwise be thought, but that they are
replenished with much wit and wisdom, seeing they are ordained not by the
deuyse of one man alone, or of a hundrethe wise counselors only, but of mo
then three hundredth chosen men, much agreeinge with the number of the
ancient senatoures of Room: as they that know the fashion of the Parliament
of England, and the order and manner of calling the same together are hable
more distinctly to declare. And if it fortune these statutes beeinge devised
with such great solemnity and wit, not to fall out so effectuallye as the
intent of the makers did wyshe, they may be quicklye reformed, but not without
the assent of the commens and states of the realm, by whose authority they
were first devised. Thus most worthy Prince you do plainlye understand all
the kinds of the laws of England.

And touching their qualities, as whether they be good or not, you shall be
able to measure that as well by your own wit, as by comparinge them with other
laws. And when ye shall find none in the whole world of like excellency, you
must of force grant them to be not only good, but also on your behalf most
to be embraced.

Hear he deuyseth a mean how to know the diversity between the Civil
laws and the laws of England. Chap. 19.
ONe only doubt wherwt your mind is troubled, remains now behi^de
undiscussed. And yt is this. Whether as yt civil lawz, so likewise ye lawz of
England be fruytfull and effectual, these for the royalme of England as the
other for the Empiere, and whether they may worthily be judged fytte and
meet. Comparisons, most noble prince (as I remember I hard you ones say) are
compted odious. Wherefore I am loathe to meddle with them. But whether they be
both of like worthiness, or that the one deseruethe an higher commendation then
the other heareof you may gather a pythier argument out of those points,
wherein their sentences do differ then by my declaracion. For where both the
lawez do agree, the praise of them is equal.

But in cases where they disagree, the worthyer law is most prayse-woorthye.
Wherefore we will now propound some such cases, to the intent you may
indifferentlye ponder and weye whether of these doothe most iustlye and better
define the same. And first we will put furthe exaumples of cases of much
weight.

SOlum iam vnu^ de his quibus agitatur animus tu us restat explana^du^, vz an
vt Ciuiles, ita et ang. leges frugi sint et efficaces, isti Angliae regno, vt
illae imperio, etiam et accomode iudicari me reantur. Comparationes vero
pri^ceps, vt te aliquan do dixisse recolo odiosae reputantur, quo eas aggredi
non delector, tu an equalis sint ambae leges meriti, vnaue altera celsius
preconium mereatur, non ex meo iuditio, sed ex his in quibus earum differunt
sententiae, efficatius carpere poteris argumentum. Nam vbi co^ueniunt Leges
ambae, aequalis laudis ipsae sunt, sed in casibus vbi ipsae dissentiunt,
prestantioris legis preconia digna pensatione refulgent. Quare casus huiusmodi
aliquos iam in medium proferemus vt quae legum illarum eos iustius meliusque
diffiniat, equa lance valeas ponderare, et primo ex casibus maximi po^deris
exe^pla preponamus.

The first case wherein the Civil laws, and the laws of England do differ.
Ca. 20
IF they that have a matter of controversy depending before a Judge come to ye
co^testation of the suite upon the matter of ye deed which ye lawyers of
England call ye issu of ye plea: the truth of such an issue by the civil laws
must be tried by the deposition of witnesses, wherein.ii. allowable witnesses
are sufficient. But by ye laws of England the truth of the matter cannot
appier evident to the Judge without ye oaths of xii. men neighbors to the place
where such a deed is supposed to be done. Now therefore the question is
whether of these two, so diverse procedinges ought to be esteemed more
reasonable and effectual for the opening of the truth, which thus is sought
for. For the law yt can more certainly and better show the truth, is in this
behalf of more excellency than ye other yt is of less efficacy and force.
wherefore in the search of this matter thus we proceed.

SIcoram Iudice co^tende^tes, ad litis perueniant contestatione^ super materia
facti, qua^ legis Angliae periti exitu^ pl'iti appell'. Exitus hm^oi veritas
per leges Ciuiles testiu^ depositione^ probari debet, i^ qua duo testes idonei
sufficient, Sed per leges Angliae, veritas illa no^ nisi.xij. hominu^ de
vicineto vbi factu^ huiusmodi suponitur sacrame^to, Iudici constari poterit.
Queritur igitur, quis horu^ duoru^ processuu^ ta^ diuersoru^ rationabilior
censeri debeat and efficatior, ad veritate^ quae sic queriturreuela^da^. Quia
lex q^ ea^ certius meliusque oste^dere potest, prestantior in hoc est lege
altera quae no^ ta^tae efficatiae est et virtutis, quare in huius rei indagine
sic procedimus.

Here are set ^urth the inconveniences proceeding of the law, which no otherwise
then by witnesses admits trials. Cap. 21.
BY the Civil laws ye party which in ye issue holdethe the affirmative must
bring forth witnessez which he himself at his own pleasure shall name But the
negative cannot be proved directli, though indirectly it may: For the hability
of him is thought to be very small and weak, and his wit much less, which
among all the men that he knows is not able to find ii. so void of
conscience and truth, which for dread, love or profit will not be ready to
gainesaye all truth.

Such then may he produce for witnesses on his side.

And if the other party would object any thing against them, or their
saienges, it chances not ever yt they and their conditions and doings are
known to ye contrary party: so yt by reason of their foul life's and
vicious behavior such witnesses might be reproved. And while their saienges
co^teine the affirmative, it shall be very hard to reprove them by circumstances
or any other indirect meanz. who then shall be hable to live in suertie of his
goods or of himself under such a law, ye ministers such aid to every busy
body yt lusts to trouble another? And what ii. wicked men are so unwary and
vncircu^spect, which touching the deed whereof they shall be examined in
judgment, will not before they are called forth for witnesses secreatly
imagine and devise a form and fassio^ thereof, and frame thereunto all
circumstances even such as must needs have been so, if ye thing had been true
in deed? For ye children of this world (says ye lord) are wiser then ye
children of light. So ye most wicked Iesabel brought forth ii. witnesses of ye
children of Beliall in judgment against Nabot, whereby he lost his life, and
king Achab her husband obtained the possession of ye vyneyarde. So the most
chaste matrone Susa^na should have dyed for aduoutrye by the wytnes of twoe
old dotardes being judges, if the lord had not meruelouslye delivered her
by a wonderful feate of prudence, which of nature the young child had not
being yet under age. And though ye same child by their altering and doubling
in their depositions did co^uict them to be false wretches, yet who (save only
the lord) could have known that in their saienges they would thus have
disagreed? Seeinge there was no law ye did move the^ to have in remembrance
what kind of tree it was, wherunder ye fact was supposed to be done. For the
witnesses of every wicked deed are not thought to consider al circu^staunces
apperteining to ye same, being such as do nothing help to ye aggrauatio^ and
detectio^ of ye fault. But while those wicked judges willinglye swearing did
alter touching ye kinds of the trees, their own words proved the^ to be
false verlets. Wherefore they worthily suffered the same punisheme^t themselves.
You also most gracious prince do know how yt lately master I. Fring after yt
he had continued three years in the order of pristehoode was compelled by the
deposition of twoe wicked persons which witnessed that he had before he was
made priest betrouthed himself to a certain young woman, to forsake the
holy order of priestehoode, and to marrye the same womanne. With whom when
he had lived fourtene years, and had beegotten.vii* children of her, at
ye last beeinge convicted of treason conspired against your highness, he
confessed before all the people even at the very point of death that those
witnesses were hiered, and that their depositions were false. And thus many
times are iudgeme^tz perverted by the mean of false witnesses, yea and that
under the very best Judges as unto you it is not unheard, nor to the world
unknown, while this wickedness (the more is the pity) is often committed.

Of the cruelty of rackinges. Cap. 22
THerefore the law of France in offenses criminal whereupon death depends is
not content to convict the party accused by witnesses, least by the testimony
of false persons innocent blood should be condemned. But that law chooses
rather to torment such offe^ders with racking, until they themselves confess
their own fault, rather then by ye deposition of witnesses, which mani times
through wicked affeccions, and sometimes by ye subornation of evil me^, are
moved to perjury. Upon this and such like cautels and respects offe^dours
and suspect persons are in that royalme with so many kynds of rackynges
tourme^ted that my pen abhors to put the^ in writting.

For some are stretched our upon a horse in such wise that their synowes
break, and their veins gousheout with streams of blood. Again other some
have diverse great weightez hanged at their feet: whereby their limbs and
joints are dissolved and unloosed.

Some also have their mouths so long gagged open, till such abundance of
water be powered in that their holly swells like a hill or a tonne, to the
intent that then the bellye being persed with some boring instrument, the water
may issue and spoute out thereat and at the mouth stream wise, not much unlike
a whale which when he has supped up and swallowed down a great quantitye of
sea water, with herringes and other small fishez, gusheth out ye same water
again as high as the top of any Pyneapple tree. My pen is both weary and
ashamed to rehearse the outragiousnes of torments devised i^ this behalf. For
the number of them is so great, that it can scant well be noted in a whole
skin of parchement. More over the Civil laws for want of witnesses do
fetch out the truth by such rackinges. And so do diverse other Countries
too. But who is so hard hearted, which being once released out of so cruel
a Rack, though he be innocent and fautles, would not yet rather accuse
himself of all kinds of offenses, then again to commytt himself to the
intolerable cruelty of the tourment ones proved: and had not rather dye at
ones (seeinge death is the end of all miseries) then so often to be killed,
and to sustain so many hellyshe furies, paynfuller then death it self?

And did not you most worthy prince know a certain offendour which in
such tourmentes accused a woorshipfull, yea a right good and faithful
knighte of treason, wherein, as he said they twoe had co^spired together,
which treason he himself being released from the rack, afterward attempted
and accomplished, thereby to acquit himself from coming to the torture again.
But at the last by mean of those tourme^ts being so meamed in his body, that
thereby he was brought in despair of his life and thereupon receauynge his
howsell, he the^ swore by ye same body of the lord, and, by the death which
he believed that he should furthwith dye, that the said knight was innocent and
gilties in all things whereof he had accused hi^, howbeit the pains wheri^ he
was at the time of that his accusacion he said were so extreme, that rather
the^ he would feel the same agai^e, he would no stick to accuse the said
knight again, yea and his own father to. This he said being then at ye very
poi^t of death, which he believed he could not then escape. No nor he escaped
not the death which he then feared. But afterward being hanged, at the time
of his death he cleared the said knight of all crimes whereof before he had
defamed hi^. Thus (o pitiful case) do many other wretcheis not for ye truethes
sake, but forced thereunto by the extremity of tourmentes, And what certentie
then can arise of the confessions of miserable tourme^ted persons. But if some
innocent body having his mind fixed upon eternal salvation, would in such a
Babylonicall furnace with the iii. children bless and magnify the lord, and
not lie to the damnation of his own soul, in ye ye judge pronounces him
unguilty, does not that judge by the self same judgment judge himself guilty
of all the cruelty and pai^es wherewith he has tourmented the innocent. O
how cruel is such a law which in that it can not condemn the syelie
innocent, condempneth the judge. Suerly such a custom is not to be accounted a
law, but rather the hieghe way to the devil O judge, in what schole have
thou learned to be present, while the offendour is tourmented? For the
execution of judgments upon offe^dours ought to be do^e by me^ of base degree:
ye doers whereof do purchase to themselfes present infamy by the deed doing,
in so much that ever after they are dishabled from the p^ferment of a judge.
Neither does the lord god execute his judgments pronounced against the
dampened by angels, but by deuylls. Yea and in Purgatory the souls there
remayni^ge, though they be predestinate too glory, yett are they not
tourmented of good angels, but of evil. Those also are evil and wicked men
by whom the lord in this world does minister to wretched sinners deserved
punishem^t For when god said i^ the xxii. chapter of the third book of Kings:
Who shall deceive Achab. it was an evil spirit that answered: I will be a
lying spirit in ye mouth of all his prophets. For it becomed not a good
spirit to take upon him the execution of such things though this judgment
proceeded from the lord that Achab should be deceued by a lie. But the judge
peradventure will say: I with mine own hands did nothing in these
tourmentes But what differth it whether one be a doer with his own^ hands, or
else be present at the doing, and the thing that is done to exasperate hit by
his commandment. It is only the master of the ship that brings it to ye
haue^, though by his commandment an other be the stiresman I believe that the
wound wherewith ye mind of the judge thus tourmentinge any man is plaged,
will never be healed again specially while he remembers the extremity of ye
pains sustained by the poor wretch i^ those miserable tourments

Here he shows that the Civil law often fails in doing of Justice. Cap. 23.
Moreover if by reason of bargayni^ge, or by sufferinge of injuries, or by
title of i^herita^ce right do accrewe to aman to plead in judgment, if there
be no witnesseis or if such as were witnesseis be dead, the plai^tif must
needs let his actio^ fall, except he be hable to prove his right by inevitable
conjectures, which is seldom seen. Wherefore concerning lordeshippes and
other possessions rueled by the civil law and in all accions falling under
the same law the actions of the plaintifes for want of witnesses many times
are choked, so that skant the half part of them atteyneth to the desiered
end. What manner of law then is this which to them ye sustain wrong thus
fails in yeeldinge Justice? I doubt whether it deserve too be called a just
law, because in the same law it is written, that Justice renders too every
man that which is his own. But this cannot such a law do.

PReterea, si ex contractibus, illatisue iniuriis, vel hereditatis titulo, ius
accreuerit homini age^di in iudicio: si testes non fuerint, vel si qui fuerint
moria^tur, succumbet ipse agens in causa sua, nisi ius suu^ probare valeat
ineuitabilibus coniecturis, quod facere crebro non conti^git. Quare de dominiis
et aliis possessionibus iure civilly regulatis, similiter et in omnibus
actionibus cade^tibus sub eode^ iure, actiones age^tiu^ pro defectu testium

qualis tu^c est lex huiusmodi, q^ iniuriatis taliter deficit in iusticia

Iusticia vnicuique tribuit quod suum e^, quoth no^ faciat lex talis

Here he declares how counties are divided, and shieri^ffs chosen.
Now that we have opened after what manner the Civil laws do enfourme a judge
of the truth of a matter brought into judgment, it is consequent to declare
by what means the laws of England do boult out the truth of such a
matter. For the orders of both the lawez being laid together, the qualities
of the^ both will more plainly appear: forsomuche as the philosopher says
that contraries placed one by an other will show the^ selfs more evidently.
But herein after the manner of orators in stead of a proheme, it shall not be
amysse that we open certain things before, the knowledge whereof shall give
light too things which heareafter shall come in talk wherefore thus we do
proceed. The royalme of England is divided into counties, as the royalme of
France is into Baylywyks, so that in England there is no place that is not
with in the body of some county. Cou^ties also are divided into hu^dreds
which so^e where are called wapentages. And hundredes are divided into villages
under which appellation are contained borowes and Cities. For the bounds of
villages are not contained within the circuit of walls, buyldynges, or
streets, but within the compass of fildes, great territories, certain
hamlettes, and many other, as of waters, woods and waste grou^des, which it
is not needful now to set furthe by their names: because that in England
there is skante any place, which is not contained within the compass of
villageis, though certain priuileged places within villageis are supposed to be
no parcel of ye same villages, More over in every cou^tie there is one certain
officer called the kings shierief, which among other duties belonging to his
office, puts in execucion all the commandments, and judgments of the
kings court, that are to be executed within his county His office endures
but for one year, so that after the expiratio^ of that year, he may not
minister in that office. Neither shall he within ii. years next ensueynge be
admited to ye office again. This officer is thus chosen. Every year the
morrow after All soullen day all the kings counselors meet together in the
kings exchequer, as well ye lords spiritual and temporal as all other
Justices, all the barons of the exchequer, the master of the rolls, and
certain other officers, where all these with one commen assent do name of
every county iii. knights or esquyers, whom among other of the same
county they take to be of good disposition and fame, and best disposed to the
office of the shiereif of that cou^tie. Of the which iii. the king chooses
one, whom by his letters patents he appoints sherief of the county that he
is chosen of for the year then folowinge. But he before he receive his patent
shall swear upon ye holy gospel among other articles, that he shall well
and faithfully and indifferently exercise and do his office all that year,
and that he shall receive or take nothing of any other man then the King, by
color or mean of his office.

These things being thus now presupposed, let us proceed too the search
of those things, that we seek for.

Exposita ia^ forma qua leges Ciuiles de veritate facti in iudicio deducti

iuxta se posita magis apparent: Sed in hoc oratorum more (prohemii loco) quedam
p^narrare congruet, quorum agnitione, deinde tractando clarius patere queant,
quare sic procedimus. Regnum Angliae per comitatus, vt regnum Fraunciae per
balliuatus distinguitur, ita vt non sit locus in Anglia, quae no^ sit i^fr'
corpus alicuius co^itatus. Co^itatus quoque diuiduntur in Hu^dreda, que alicubi
Wapen tagia nuncupantur. Hundreda vero diuidu^tur per villas, subquarum
appellatione continentur et Burgi atque Civitates. Villarum etenim metae, non
muris, edificiis, aut stratis terminan tur, sed agroru^ ambitubus, territoriis
magnis, hamiletis quibusda^, et multis aliis, sicut aquaru^, boscoru^, et
vastoru^ terminis, quae iam non expedit nominibus designare, q^a vix in anglia
est locus aliquis, qui non infra villarum ambitus co^tineatur, licet
priuilegiati loci quidam infravillas, de eisdem villis pars esse no^ censentur.
Preterea in quolibet comitatu est officiarius quidam vnus regis vicecomes
appellatus, qui inter cetera sui officii ministeria, omnia mandata et iudicia
curiarum regis i^ comitatu suo exequenda, exequitur, Cuius officiu^ annale est,
quo ei post annu^ in eodem ministrare no^ licet, nec duobus tu^c seque^tibus
a^nis ad ide^ of ficiu^ reassumetur Officiarius iste sic eligitur. Quolibet
anno in crastino animarum, co^ueniunt in scaccario regis omnes consiliarii
eius, ta^ dn^ispu^ales, ette^porales qua^ alii o^nes iusticiarii, omnes barons
de scaccario, clericus rotulorum, and quidam alii officiarii vbi hii omnes
co^muni assensu, nominant de quolibet comitatu tres milites vel armigeros, quos
inter ceteros eiusdem comitatus ipsi opina^tur melioris esse dispositionis et
famae, et ad officium vice comitis comitatus illius melius dispositos: ex
quibus rex vnum ta^tum eliget, que^ per litteras suas pate^tes constituet

How Iurers must be chosen and sworn
AS often as suitors in the courts of the king of England are come to ye issue
of their plea upon ye matter of the fact, furthwith the Justices by virtue of
the kings writ directed unto the shirief of the county, wherein ye deed is
supposed to be done, will him to cause to come before the same Iusticeis at a
certain day by them limited xii good and lawful men neighbors to the place
where the fact is supposed to be done: the same to be such as be of no kynne
to either of the pleaders, to the end that by there oths it may certeynly be
known, whether ye deed were done as the one party affirms, or else as the
other party denies. Upon the day aforesaid the shieref shall return the
said writ before the same Justices, together with the pannell of their names,
which he hereunto has sommoned. When they are come either party may refuse
them, allegyng that the shierief has made that pannell favorably for the
other party of persons not in different. Which exception if it be found
treue by the oath of ii men of the same pannell chosen thereunto by the
Iustyceis, that pannell shall immediately be quassed And then ye Justices shall
write to the coroners of the same cou^tie that they shall make a new painell.
Which when they have do^e if it be likewise found fautie, it shall also be
quassed. And then the Justices shall elect and choose ii of the clerks of the
same court, or other of the same cou^tie, which in the presence of the court
upon their oaths shall make an indifferent panell, which by neither of the
parties shall be challenged. Howbeit when the men so impanelled are come into the
court, either of the parties may make exceptions against the perso^e of any
of the^, as he may also do in all cases and at all times when any man by any
meanez impanelled shall appear to be sworn in the court upon the truth of
such an issue: saying that the person impannelled is cosein or allied to ye
other party or by any kind of amity so knytte unto him, that he is not
indifferent to declare the truethe between them. And of these exceptions there
are so many kinds and sorts, that theye can not be in few words
rehearsed. Whereof if any one be found true, then shall not he be sworn
against who^ the exception is purposed, but his name shallbe cancelled in the
pannell. So also shall be done of all the names of the persons impannelled,
until.xii. of the^ so indifferent be sworn, that neither party can have
against them any matter of exception or challenge. Also of these.xii.iiii. at
the least shall be of the hundred where the village stands wherein the fact where
upon the sutte riesethe is supposed to be done. And every such Iurer shall
have lands or revenues for term of life at ye least to the yearly value of
xl. s^. And this order is observed and kept in all accions and causes criminal
real, and personal, saving where the damages or debt in accio^s personal
excedeth not the su^me of.xl. marks of English money For then it is not
requisite that Iurers in such accyons shall be hable to dyspende somuche.

Yet they shall have land or rentes to a competente value after the discretion
of the Justices. Otherwise theye shall not be sworn, least for need and
poverty such Iurers might easelye be corrupt and suborned.

And if by such exceptions so many Iurers names be cancelled in the panel
that there remains not a sufficient number to make thereof a Jury, the^ ye
sherifes by ye kings write shall be commanded to adioin mo Iur^rs. Which thing
may often be don, so yt for lack of Iurers ye inquisitio^ of ye truth upon such
a plea shall not ^emai^ And this is ye fourm how Iurers and such inquisitours
of truth ought to be chose^ in the kings court. and likewise to be sworn.
Wherefore how they must be charged and infourmed of ye vtteryng of ye same
truth, this now rests to be discussed.

How Iurers ought to be enfourmed by evidences and witnesses. Cap. 26.
Twelve good and lawefull me^ being at ye last sworn in form aforsaid,
having besides their moueables, sufficient possessions as before is declared,
whereby they may be hable to mai^tai^ their own states, and being to neither
party suspected or hated, but neighbors to the^ both, the^ shall be red before
the^ in English by ye court al ye record and process of the plea dependynge
beetwene the parties, with a plain declaracion of the issue of ye plea,
touching the truth whereof those sworn me^ shall certify the court. Which
things being done either party by himself or his cou^sellours in the
presence of the court shall utter and open to the said sworn men all and
singular matters and evidences whereby he thynkethe he may best inform them of
the truethe of the issue so impleaded. And then may either party bring before
the same Justices and sworn men al and singular such witnesses on his
beehalfe as he will produce. Who by the Justices beeinge charged upon the
holy gospel of godde, shall testify al things proouynge the truth of the
fact, whereupon the parties contend And if need so require, those witnesses
shall be severed and divided til they have deposed all that they will, so that
the saying of one shall not move or provoke an other to testyfye the like.
The premises being done, then after that those Iurers have had talk at
their pleasure upon the truethe of that issue with as much deliberation as
themselfs shall require, in the keepynge of the ministers of the court within
a place to them for the same purpose assigned, to the intent that noe manne in
the mean time may corrupt them, theye shall return into the court, and
certyfie the Justices upon the decitie of the issue so joined in the presence
of both the parties (if theye willbe there) and specially of the plainetyfe
The report of which Iurers by the laws of England is called a verdycte: by
the which word is mente, a true report, or a report of the truethe. And
then according to the quality of that veredicte the Justices shall frame and
form their judgment. Notwithestandynge if the other party, against whom
the verdycte is geeuen complain that he is thereby unjustly grieved, then the
same party may sue a writ of attyncte against those Iuries, and against the
party yt has prevailed. By force of which write if it shall be found by the
oath of.xxiiij. men in form aforesaid returned elect and sworn, which
shall be men of much greater lyuynges then the first Iurers were that the same
first Iurers have made a false oath, then the bodies of ye same first Iurers
shall be committed to the kings prisone, their goods shallbee confiscate, and
al their possessions shall be seized into the kings hands. their howses also
and buildings shall be rased and thrown down, there woods felled, and their
medowe grou^des plowed And also ye same f^rst Iurers shall for ever after be
noted for infamed persons, and shall in no place be received to testify the
truth And the party which in the former plea had the overthrow, shall be
restored to all things which by occasion thereof he has lost. Who the^,
though he regard not his souls health, yet for fear of so great
punishmente, and for shame of so great infamye would not upon his oath
declare the truth And if one man parauenture have so little respect to his
honor or estimation, yet some of so many Iurers will not neglecte their
own good fame, nor will not thoroughe their own defaulte suffer themselfes
thus to be spoiled of their goods and possessions. Is not this order now for
the boultynge out of the truethe better and more effectual, then the process
which the Civil laws do procure? Here no cause nor no man's right quailethe
through death, or for want of witnesses Here are not brought f^rthe unknown
witnesses, hiered persons, pore men, vagaboundes, unconstant people or such
whose conditions and naughtynes is unknown. These witnesses are neygheboures
hable to live of their own, of good name and fame of honest report, not
brought into the court by the party, but by a worshipful and indifferent
officer chosen, and so compelled to come before the judge. These know all that
the witnesses are hable to depose, ^id theye know also the constancye and
vnconstauncye of the witnesses, and what report goethe upon the^. And what
will ye have more. Doubtless there is nothing that may dysclose the truethe of
any doubt falling in contention, which can in any wise be hid from such
Iurers, so that it be possible for the same to come to man's knowledge.

Here he shewethe how causes criminal are determined in England. Cap. 27.
But it is also necessary to discuss how in matters criminal the laws of
England do fetch out the truth that perfectlye understanding the form of
both the laws, we may the more certainelye perceive and know whether of
them both does more effectually discover the hid truth.

If any manne accused of felonye or treason in England do at his
arreignemente before the Judges deny the offense, furthwithe the sheriff of
the county where ye deed was done shall cause to come before the same judges
xxiiij. good and lawefull men dwellinge nighe toe ye village where the fact
was done, such men as to the party accused be no thing allied: and such as
every of the^ has. C.s. of land and revenues, to certify the judges upon the
truth of the crime. Which at their appearaunce the party accused may
challenge in like sort as in actions real may be done, as before is
described. And moreover the same party in favor of his life may challenge
five and thirty men such as he most fearethe: which upon his challenge
shall be cancelled in the panel, or shall be noted with such marks, that theye
shall not pass upon him: though he be not hable to show any cause of his
exception and challenge. Who then can unjust lie dye in England for any
criminal offense, seeing he may have so many helps for the favor of his
life, and that none may condemn him but his neighbors, good and lawful
men against whom he has no matter of exception. In deed I would rather
wyshe twentye evil dooers to escape death thoroughe pity, then one manne
to be unjustly c^ndempned. And yet it is not to be suspected, that any
off^ndoure can under this form escape the punishment of his offense,
forasmuch as his life and conversation shall be afterward a terroure to them
that have thus cleared him of the crime. In this kind of proceedynge there is
noe crueltye or extremity used. Neither can the innocent and vnguiltye person
be hurt in his body or lymmes. Wherefore he shall not stand in fear of the
sclau^der of his enemies, because he shall not be racked or tormen^ed at
their will and pleasure.

Thus under this law a man may pass his life with quietness and safety.
Judge you therefore most noble prince whether of these laws ye had rather
chose, if you should live a private life.

SEd quomodo i^ criminalibus leges Angliae scruta^tur veritatem etia^ ^imare
per necessarium est, vt et i^ eis plenarie agnita a^barum legum forma, quae
earum efficacius latentem reuelat veritatem certius agnoscamus. Si reus quispi

The prince grants the laws of England to be more commodious for the
subjects, then the Civil laws in the case now disputed. Cap. 28.
WHereunto the prince answered and said. I see no hard or strange matter,
good Chau^celour that should make me doubtefull or dangerous in the election
and choice of the thing that ye ask. For who would not rather choose to
live under that law, wherevnder he might live in securitye, then under that
law, which would set him naked and succourlesse against the crueltye of
his enemies. Verelye no man can be saufe in body or gooddes, whom his
aduersarye may convince in every cause with two unknown witnesses of his
own choosynge and bringing fourth.

And though a man be not compelled by their sayenges to dye, yet is he
little relieved that has escaped death, being shronke in all his synnews
and lymmes, and cast intoo a perpetual impotencye of his body. And truly
into such danger may the craft of a spytefull person bring any manne that
lyuethe under the law, which herewhile you spoke of. But such mischief and
inconvenience cannot be wroughte by witnesses that make their depositions in
the presence of twelve credyble men neighbors to the deed that is
presentlye in question, and to the circumstaunces of the same: which also know
the manners and conditions of ye same witnesses, specially if they be nigh
dwellers and know also whether they be men worthy to be credited or no.
And further all those xii. cannot be ignorant in those things that were
done by and among their neighbors. For I know more certeinelye the things
that are done hear in Barro where I am now remayninge, then those things
that are done in England. Neither do I think that things can be kept from
the knowledge of a good and honest man being done nighe to his house, and
almost under his nose, be they never so secretlye done.

But yet I maruail much why the foresaid law of England, which is so good
and commodious, is not commen to all the whole world.

CVi princeps. Arduu^ a^bigu u^ue Ca^cellarie, no^ conspicio, qd' morosum me

Vere tutus quisqua^ esse no^ poterit in corpere aut in bonis, que^ inimicus

Why inquestes are not made by iuries of.xii. men in other roialmes as well as
in England. Cap. 29
YOur highness came very young out of England (quod the chancellor,) so that
the disposicion and quality of that land is unknown unto you.

Which if ye know, and should compare therewith the commodities and qualities
of other countries, you would nothing marvel at these things, which now
do trouble your mind. In deed England is so fertile and fruitful, that
comparinge quantity to quantity, it surmounteth all other lands in
fruitfulnes. Yea it brings furthe fruit of it self skant provoked by man's
industry and labor.

For there the lands the fields, the groves and the woods do so
abundauntlye spring, that the same untilled do commonly yield to their
owners more profit then tylled, though else they be most fruitful of corn
and grain. There also are fildes of pasture enclosed with hedges and d^tches,
with trees planted and growing upon the same, which are a defense to their
herds of sheep and cattle, as well against storms, as also against the
heat of the son. And the pastures are commonly watered, so that cattle
shut and closed therein have no need of keeping neither by day, nor by
night. For there be noe wolfes, nor bears, nor Lions. Wherefore their
sheep lie night by night in the fields vnkepte within their foldes, wherewith
their land is manured. By ye mean whereof the men of that country are
skante troubled with any painful labor. Wherefore they live more
spiritually, as did the ancient fathers which did rather choose to keep and
feed cattle the^ to disturb ye quietness of the mind with the care of
husbandrye. And hereof it comes that men of this countreye are more apt
and fit to discern in doubtful causes of great examination and trial,
then are men whollye geeuen to moylyng in the ground: in whom that rural
exercise ingendreth rudenes of wit and mind. More over the same country is
so filled and replenyshed with landed men, that therein so small a thorpe can
not be found wherein dwellethe not a knight, an esquier, or such a householder
as is there commonly called a fra^klayne, enryched with great possessions:
And also other freeholders, and many yomen hable for their liuelods to make a
Jury in form aforemencioned. For there be in that land diverse yomenne
which are able to dispende by the year above a hundredth pounds Wherefore the
Iuries before declared are there very often made, specially in great matters of
knights, esquiers, and others whose possessions in the whole amounts yearly
above the sum of five hundredth marks.

Wherefore it cannot be thought that such men can be suborned, or that they
will be perjured, not only for that they have before their eyes the fear
of God, but also, for that theye have a careful regard too the preservation
of their honors, and to the eschueyng of reproach, and damage thereuppon
ensuynge, and also that their heirs be not impeched through their infamye.
After this manner, O mighty Prince are none other royalmes of the world
dysposed and inhabyted.

For though there be in them men of great power, of great riches, and
possessions, yet they dwell not one nyghe to an another as such great men
do in England. Neither so many inherytoures and possessoures of land are
elsewhere as in England. For in a whole town of an other Country it is hard
to find one man which for his lyuelode is hable to be received into a Iurye.
For there, except it be in Cities and walled towns, very few there be,
beside noble men that have any possessions of lands or other immouables.

The noble men also have there small store of pasture. And to labor in
vyneyardes, or to put their hands to ye plough that is unfit for their
estate and degree.

And yet in vineyardes and eareable ground consists the substance of their
possessions, saving only a few fyeldes next adioyninge to great ryuers,
and saving also certain woodz the pastures whereof are commen to their tenants
and neighbors.

How then can a Jury be made in such countries of xii. substaunciall men
nighe adioyninge to the place of any deed brought in judgment, seeinge they
can not be called neighbors that dwell so far a sunder. Truly xii. sworn
men theare must needs be far distaunt from the place of the deed, when the
defendaunt in those Countries has challenged xxxv. men of the next
dwellers without showing any cause why. Wherefore in those lands a Iurye
must be made either of su^he as dwell far of from the place of the deed that
is in controversy, and therefore cannot attain to the knowledge of the truth
thereof, or else it must be made of poor men that be not ashamed of
infamy, neither do fear the loss of their goods which they have not.

They also blinded with rusticall and brute rudenes are not hable to behold
the clear bryghtnesse of the truth.

Marueyle not therefore, mo^ woorthye Prince, if the law whereby the truethe
is sifted out in England be not frequented and used in other nations.

For they are not hable to make sufficient and like Iuries as be made in
England.

CAncellarius. Iuuenis recessisti (pri^ceps) ab Anglia, quo tibi ignota est
dispositio et qualitas terrae illius, quas si agnoueris, et cete^aru^ regionum

Ex quibus homines regionis istius apti magis reddu^tur et dispositi, ad

Taliter, fili regis, disposita inhabitataque non sunt aliqua alia mundi regna.

Nam licet in eis sint viri magnae potentiae, magnorum opum et possessionum,
non tamen eorum vnus prope moratur ad alterum, vt in Anglia tanti morantur
viri, nec tanta vt ibi hereditatorum est copia et poss^^e^tiu^ terras: vix enim
in villata vna regionum aliaru^ reperiri poterit vir vnus, patrimonio

oportebit facere iuratam, aut de pauperibus, quibus non est verecundia
infamiae, nec timor iacturae bonorum suorum, cum ipsa non sint ipsi etiam
rusticitatis ruditate obcecati, veritatis claritatem nequeunt intueri.

Non igitur mireris princeps silex qua in Anglia veritas inquiritur, alias non
peruaget' nationes, ipsae nanque vt Anglia facere nequeunt sufficie^tes
co^similesque iuratas.

Here the prince commends the laws of England of their proceeding by
Iuries. Cap. 30
THough we have said, (quod the prince, that co^parisons are odious, yet the
Civil law in the comparison by you made has cleared it self from all blame.
For though you have proved ye law of England to be of more excellencye
then it, yet it deserves not thereby to be odious, forso much as you have
blamed neither it nor the makers thereof.

But have showed ye country where it rules to be the only cause why it does
not in matters of doubt try out the truth with so commendable a kind of
proceedinge, as the law of England does. But as touching that ye law of
England in the case by you now discussed is more fit and meet for that
roialme then the Civil law, hereof we may not doubt. Wherefore we are not
desirous to change it for the Civil law. Howbeit this preeminence of the
law of England proceeds not of the fault of the other. For it is only the
fertility of England that has caused it to be such as it is.

TVnc princeps Comparationes odiosas esse licet dixerimus, lex tamen Ciuilis in
comparatione per te facta omni se purgauit a crimine: quia licet ei Legem
Angliae tu p^etuleris, odium inde ipsa non meretur, dum neque eam, neque
co^ditores eius increpasti. sed solu^ patriam vbi illa regit causa^ esse
demo^strasti quod non tam optabili processu vt lex Angliae, ipsa in dubiis
elicit veritatem. Legem vero Angliae in casu iam per te disputato,
accomodatiorem esse regno illi quam est lex ciuilis, ambigere non sinimur, quo
eam pro civilly co^mutare non appetimus, sed tamen hec legis Angliae
preeminentia, ab alterius crimine non euenit, solum enim eam Angliae fertilitas
sic causauit.

The Prince doubts whether this proceeding by a Iurye be repugnaunt to godds
law or not. Chap. 31.
But though we be greatly delited in the form which the laws of England
use in sifting out the truth in matters of contention, yet whether the same
law be contrary to holy scripture or not, that is to us somewhat doubtful.

For our Lord saiethe to the Pharasies in the vii. Chapter of Saint Iohnz
Gospel: In your law it is written that the testimonye of two men is true.
And the lord confirming the same says. I am one that bear witness of my
self, and the father that sent me bears wytnes of me.

Now sir the Pharasies were Jews, so that it was all one to say. It is
written in your law and it is written in Moses law, which God gave to the
children of Israel by Moses.

Wherefore to gaynesaie this law is too deny gods law. Whereby it folowethe
that if the law of England swerve from this law, it swaruethe also from Godds
law, which in no wise may be contraryed.

It is written also in ye eyghteenthe Chapter of Saint Mathues gospel: Where
the lord speaking of brotherlye admonition, among other things sayethe thus:
But if thy brother here she not then take yet with thee one or twooe, that in
the mouth of twoe or three witnesses every matter may be stablished.

If the Lord have appointed every matter to be stablyshed in ye mouth of twoe
or three witnesses, then it is in vain for to seek for the verdict of many
men in matters of doubt. For no man is able to lay any other or better
foundation then the Lord has laid.

These are the doubts good Chauncelloure which touching the procedynge of
the law of England in the trial of matters do so^ewhat trouble me. Wherefore
what au^swer may here unto be made I would gladly learn of you

SEd licet non in fime Canceltarie, nos delectet forma, qua leges Angliae in
contentionibus reuelant veritatem, tamen an modus ille sacrae repugnet
scripturae vel non, paululum agitamur. Ait namque dominus phariseis. Ioh. viii.
In lege vestra scriptum est, quia duorum hominum testimonium verum est, et huic
applaude^s dominus inquit, ego sum qui testimonium perhibeo de me ipso, et
testimonium perhibet de me qui misit me pater.

Pharisei quippe iudei erant, vnde idem erat dicere in Lege vestra scriptum
est, et in Lege Mosay^^ (quae a domino per Moysen filiis Israel prolata fuit)
scriptum est.

Quare huic legi co^traire, legi e^ diuin^ refragari, quo sequit', qd' lex
Angliae si ab hac lege discedat, a lege diuina, cui reluctari no^ licet, ipsa
discedit. Scribitur etiam Math.xviij. Quod dominus (loquens de correctione
fraterna) inter alia sic ait. Si autem non te audierit frater tuus, adhibe
tecum adhuc vnum aut duos, vt in ore duorum vel trium, stet omne verbum. Si in
ore duorum vel trium dominus omne verbum statuerit, frustra plurimum hominum
queritur in dubiis veredictum. Nemo enim potest melius aut aliud fundamentum
ponere, quam posuit dominus.

Hec sunt Cancellarie quae me de legis angliae processu in probationibus
aliquantulum conturbant. Quare q^d his respondendum est a te doceri deposco

Here is showed that the procedinge by a Jury is not repugnaunt to the law of
god. Cap. 32.
THe laws of England, quod the Cau^cellour are nothi^ge at all repugnaunt to
these things that trouble you, most worthy prince, though they in matters of
doubt do somewhat otherwise boult out ye truth. The law of the general
counsel, wheri^ it is provided that Cardinals shall not be co^uicted of
crimi^al offenses otherwise then by the deposition of xii witnesses, is it any
hynderaunce to the testimony of ii. men If? the testimony of ii men be true,
of more force must the testimony of xii men be judged true, acordynge to a
rule of the law that sayethe: The more ever conteyneth in it that which is
less. The i^holder was promised to be rewarded with an overplus, if he
bestowed upon the cure of the wounded man more then the ii. pense which he
received. A man that laboreth to prove that he was absent at the time of the
offense wherewith he is charged, shall it not be needful for him to bring
furthe mo then ii or iii, witnesses, when his adversary has proved, or is
ready to prove the same by ii. or iii. witnesses. And so he that trauaylethe
to convince witnesses of perjury, must of necessite bring furthe many mo then
they were so that the testimony of ii. or iii. men shall not ever be judged
true. But that law must thus be understood, that by a lesser number of
witnesses then ii. the truth in matters doubtful ought not to be searched
for, as appears by Bernard assignynge diverse cases wherein by the laws mo
then iii. witnesses must needs be produced. As in some of them v, and in and
in some vii. Nor yett the laws of England be not against it, but that the
truethe may be proved by ii. witnesses, when it can no otherwise be tried For
if things be done upon the sea without the body of any countye of that
royalme, which afterward be brought in plea before the lord admiral, the same
things by the decrees of ye laws of england must be proved by witnesses. In
like manner it has been accustomed to be done before the Constable and
Marshall of England touching a fact that was done in an other royalme, so
that the heari^ge thereof appertai^eth to the Constables court. Moreover in
the courts of certain liberties in England where matters proceed by law
merchaunt contractes or bargaynes made among merchau^tz in an other royalme
are proved by witnesses.

And this comes to pass because that in these cases there be no neighbors
found by whose oaths Iuries of xii men may be made, as in contractes and other
cases ariesynge within the royalme of England is accustomed to be do^e
Likewise if a deed wherein witnesses are named be brought into the kings
court, then process shall be made against those witnesses: and they together
with xii. Iurers shall by their oaths recognize whether the same be his deed
or no whose it is supposed to be. Wherefore the law of England reproves not
that law which by witnesses tries out the truth, specially when necessity
so requirethe. For so do ye laws of England too, not only in the cases now
mentioned, but also in certain other cases, whereof here to make rehersall it
shall not be material. Howbeit this law never determines a controversy by
witnesses only that may be determined by a Jury of xii. men: forsomuche as
this way is much more aualeable and effectual for the trial of the truth
then is the form of any other laws of the world and further from the danger
of corruption and subornation. Nor this fourm^ of proceedinge cannot in any
cause faille for want of witnesses: nor the testimonies of witnesses, (if any
be) can not choose but come to their due end and effect Neither ca^ such xii.
men be forsworn, but that for their offe^se they must suffer most sharp
punishment, and nevertheless the party by their depositions grieved shall
obteie due remedy And these things shall not be do^e by ye will and sai^ges
of strange or unknown men but by the oaths of good, of worshipful, and of
credible me^ neighbors to the parties, in whom the same parties have no cause
of challenge or mistrust touchi^g their verdit. O how horrible and detestable
dangers happen mani times through the form of proceedinge by witnesses. If
a man make a privy contract of matrimony, and afterward before witnesses do
betrouthe or assure himself to another woman, shall he not in the contentious
court be compelled to marye her, and also after that in ye penitenciall court
be judged to lie with the first, if he be duly required, and to do penance as
often as by his own mocio^ and procurement he liethe with the second, though
in both courts the judge be one and the self same man. In this case, as it
is written in Job, are not ye synewes of Leuyathan perplexed and intricat. Fie
for shame, they are i^tricate in deed For this man can carnally company with
neither of these ii. women, nor with any other without punishment either by
the contentious court, or by the penitenciall court. Such a mischief,
inconvenience, or danger can never happen in any case by the way of
proceedi^g by the law of England, no not though Leuiatha^ himself would
labor to procure the same. Do ye not now see, most noble prince, that the more
you object against the laws of England, the more worthy they appear.

CAncellarius. non his quibus turbaris princeps, contrariantur leges Angliae

Wherefore certain Kings of England have had ^o delight in their own laws.
Cap. 33.
I see plainly, quod the prince, that in the case wherein you have now
trauayled they have the preeminence above all other laws of the world Yet we
have heard that some of my progenitors kings of England have not be plesed
with their own laws, and have therefore gone about to bring in ye Civil
laws to the government of England, and to abolish yeir own country laws
For what purpose and i^te^t they so did I much marueyll.

PRinceps. Video inquit, et eas inter tocius orbis iura (in casu quo tu ia^
sudasti) prefulgere considero, tamen progenitorum meoru^ Angliae regu^ quosda^

Here the Chancellor opens the cause which the prince demands. Ca. 34.
You would nothi^ge marueyll here at, quod the Chancellor, if you did
deeply consider with your self ye cause of this intent. For you have hard
before how that among the Civil laws that maxim or rule is a sentence most
notable, which thus syngeth: The princes pleasure stands in force of a law:
quite contrary to the decrees of the laws of England, whereby the king there
of ruelethe his people not only by regal, but also by politic government.
In somuche that at ye tie of his coronation he is bound by an oath to the
obseruaunce and keepi^g of his own law, which thing so^e kings of England
not well brooking as thinking that thereby they should not freely govern
their subjects as other kings do, whose ruele is only regal, gouernynge
their people by the Civil law, and chiefly by that foresaid maxim of the
same law whereby they at their pleasure change laws make new laws, execute
punishments, burden their subjects with chargeis: and also when they lust,
do determine controversies of sueters, as pleases them. Wherefore these your
progenitors went about to cast of the yoke politic, that ^hey also might
likewise ^uele or rather rage over ^he people their subjects ^n regal wise
only: not ^onsyderynge that the power of both kings is ^quall, as in the
foresaid ^reatise of the law of the ^awe of nature is declared: and that to
ruele the people by government politic is no yoke, but liberty, and great
security not only to the subjects, but also to ye king king himself: and
further no small lightening or easement of his charge. And that this may
appear more evident unto you, ponder and weighe the experience of both
regimentes And begin with the ki^ge of France, perusi^ge after what sort he
ruelethe his subjects by regal government alone. And then come to ye effect
of the ioynte governance regal and politic, examinynge by experience how
and after what manner the king of England gouernethe his subjects.

CAncellarius. Non admireris princeps, si causam huius conaminis me^te solicita

The inconveniences that happen in the royalme ^f France through regal
government alone. Cap. 35.
CAll to remembrance, most worthy prince after what sort you saw ye wealthy
villages and towns (as touching ^^ore of corn) in the royalme of France,
while you were there a so iourner, pestered with the kings men at arms and
their horses, so that skant in any of ye great towns there you could get any
lodging. Wheare of ye inhabiters you learned yt those men, though they
continue in one village a monethe or ii, do not nor will pay any thing at all
either for their own charges, or for the charges of their horses. But, which
is worse, y^y compelled ye i^habitz of ye vilages and town dwellers whether
they ca^e, to provide of their own proper costs out of the villages
adioyninge wine and flesh for them, and other things yt they needed at dearer
prices then they might have bought the same at home. And if any refused thus to
do, they were ano^ by plain stafford law forced to do it. And when they had
spent all the victualies, fuel, and horse meat in one town, then those men
went to an other town wasting the same in like manner, not payeyng one pennye
for any necessaries either for themselfs, or else for their co^cubines and
harlottes, whereof they ever carried carried about with them great abundaunce,
nor for hose^ or shows, and other like even to the least poi^t or lace, but
they compelled the townsmen, wheare theye carried to bear all their
expenses. And thus were all the villages and unwalled towns of that land used,
so that there is not the least village there free from this miserable
calamity, but that it is once or twyse every year beggered by this kind of
pilling. Furthermore the king suffers no man to eat salt within his
kingdom, except he buy it of the king at such price as pleases him to
assesse.

And if any poor man had rather eat his meat fresh, then to buy salt so
excessiuely dear, he is imi^mediatly compelled to buy so much of ye kings
salt at the kings price as shall suffice so many persons as he keeps in his
house. Moreover all the inhabyters of that royalme geeue yearelye to the king
the fowerthe part of all the wynes yt their grou^des bearethe: and every
vintener the fowerth penney of the price of the wine that he sellethe. And
beesides all this every village and borroughe payethe yearelye to the king
great sums of money assessed upon them for the wages of men at arms, so
that the charges of the kings army, which is ever very great, is mainteyned by
the poor people of ye villages, boroughes, and towns of ye roialme. And yet
moreover every village findethe continuallye two Crossebowes at the least,
and some mo with all furnyture and habyliments requisite for the kings
service in his wars as often as it pleasethe him to muster them which he
does very often. And these things not considered, other exceedynge great
talleges are yearelye assessed upon every vyllage of the same royalme to the
kings use, whereof theye are no year released. The people beeinge with these
and diverse other calamities plagued and oppressed, do live in great mysery,
dri^ki^g water daily. Neither do ye inferior sort taste any other licor saui^g
only at sole^pne feasts Their shamewes are made of hemp, much like to sack
clothe. Woollen clothe theye wear none, except it be very course, and that
only in their coats under their said upper garments. Neither use they
any hosen, butte from the knee upward: the residue of their legs go naked.
Their women go barefoote saving on holy days. Neither men nor women eat
any flesh there, but only larde of bacon, with a small quantity whereof
they fatten their potage and brothes. As for roasted or sodden meat of flesh
they taste none, except it be of ye inwards sometimes and heads of beasts ye be
killed for ge^tleme^ and mercha^tz But the men at arms they devour and
consume al their pullein so, ye theye have skant the eggs left to eat for
special deintiez And if theye fortune at any time to grow somewhat wealthy
in substance, so that any of them be compted rich, he is by and by charged to
the kings subsidy more deeply the^ any of his neighbors, so that within
short time he is made equal in poverty with the rest of his beggerlye
neighbors. And this as I suppose, is the state of the common and rascal
people of that nation. But gentlemen and nobles are not so oppressed, and
ouercharched with exaccions. Butte if any of them chance to be accused of
any crime, though it be by his enemies, he is not ever wont to be cyted or
called before an ordynarye judge. But many times it has been seen that
he has in that beehalfe been talked with in the kings chamber, or elsewhere
in some private place, and sometimes only bye a pourseuaunte or messenger.
And immedyatlye as soon as the princes conscience has through the report
of others, judged him guilty, he is witheout any fassion of judgment put in
a sack and in the night season by the Marshals servants hurled i^to a river,
and so drowned. After which sort you have hard of many mo put to death, then
that have been by ordinary process of the law condemned.

How be it the princes pleasure, as say the Civil laws, has the force of a
law. Also while you wear abiding in France, and nighe to the same
kyngedome, you heard of other great enormityes like unto these, and some much
worse then these detestable and damnable done no otherwise but under ye color
of that law: which here to rehearse would continue our talk too long a
time. Now therefore let us se what ye effect of the law politic and regal,
which some of your progenitors would have changed into this Civil has
wrought in the royalme of England: that you being instructed with the
experience of both laws, may the better by their effects judge whether of
the^ ye ought rather to choose. Seeing the philosopher, as before is
rehearsed, does say, ye contraries laid together do more perfectly appear.

The commodities that proceed of the iointe government politic and regal
in the royalme of England. Cap. 36,
WIthein the roialme of England no man soiourneth in an other ma^s house without
ye love and ye leave of ye good man of ye same house: saui^g in common ynnes,
where before his deperture thence he shall fullye sattsfie and pay for all his
charges there. Neither shall he escape unpunished whosoever he be that takes
another man's goods wytheoute the good will of the owner thereof. Neither is it
unlawful for any manne in that royalme to provide and store himself of
salt and other marchaundyses or wares at his own will and pleasure of any man
that sells ye same. Howbe it the king, though ye owners would say nay
may by his officers take necessaries for his house at a reasonable price to be
assessed by the discrecions of the constables of the towns. Nevertheless he is
bound by his laws to pay therefore either presentlye in hand, or else at a
day to be limited and set by the higher officers of his house. For by his
laws he may take away none of his subjects goods, witheoute due
satisfaction for the same. Neither does the king there either by him self or
by his servants and officers levy upon his subjects tallages, subsidies,
or any other burdeins, or alter their laws, or make new laws without the
express consent and agreemente of his whole royalme in his parliamente.
Wherefore every inhabiter of that royalme uses and enjoys at his pleasure
all the fruits that his land or cattall bearethe, with all the profits and
commodytyes, which by his own travail, or by the labor of others he gains
by land or by water: not hindered by the injury or wrong deteinement of any
man but that he shall be allowed a reasonable recompense. And hereby it
commethe to pass that the men of that land are rich, having abundaunce of
gold and silver and other things necessary for the mayntenaunce of man's life
Theye drink no water, oneles it be so that soome for devotion, and upon a
zeal of penance do absteyne from other drinks. They eat plentyfullye of all
kinds of flesh and fyshe. They wear fine woollen cloth in all their apparel.
Theye have also abundaunce of bed coueryngs in their houses, and of all other
woollen stuff. They have great store of all hustlements and implements of
household. They are plentifullye furnished with all instruments of husbandry,
and al other things that are requisite to the accomplishement of a quiet and
wealthy life according to their estates and degrees. Neither are they sued in
ye law, but only before ordinarye judges, wherebye the laws of the land
theye are iustlye entreated. Neither are theye arrested or impleaded for their
moueables or possessions, or arreigned of any offense criminal be it neu^ so
great and outrageous but after the laws of the land, and before the judges
aforesaid. And this are the fruits which government politic and regal
conjoined doothe bear and bring fourth Whereof now appear euidentlye unto
you the experiences of the effects of the law, which some of your
progenitoures trauayled to abolishe. Before also you saw plainlye the
effects of the other law, which theye with such earneste endeavor labored
to advance and place in stead of this law. So that by the fruits of them
both you may know what theye are And did not ambition, ryotte, and wanton
lust, which your said progenitoures esteemed above the wealth of the realm
move them to this alteracion? Consider therefore most worthy prince, and that
earnestlye this that follows.

IN regno Angliae nullus perhendinat in alterius domo inuito domino, si non in
hospiciis publicis, vbi tunc pro omnibus quae ibidem expe^dit ip^e plenarie
soluet ante eius abinde recessum: nec impune quisque bona alterius capit, sine
voluntate proprietarij eoru^de^, neque in regno illo prepeditur aliquis sibi de
sale, aut quibuscunque mercimoniis aliis ad propriu^ arbitrium, et de quocunque
venditore prouidere. Rex tn^ necessaria domus suae per rationabile preciu^
iuxta co^stabulariorum villarum discretiones assidendum, inuitis possessoribus
per officiarios suos capere potest: sed nihillominus ipse precium illud in
manibus, vel ad die^ per maiores officiarios domus suae limita^du^, soluere per
leges suas obnoxious est: quia nullius subditoru^ suorum bona, iuxta leges illas
ip^e deripere potest, sine satisfactione debita pro eisde^ Neque rex ibide^ per
se aut ministros suos tallagia, subsidia, aut q^uis onera alia i^ponit legijs
suis, aut leges eoru^ mutat, vel nouas condit, sine co^cessione vel asse^su
tocius regni sui, in parliame^to suo exp^sso. Quare incola o^nis regni illius
fructubus quos sibi parit terra sua, et quos gignit pecus eius, emolume^tis
quoque o^i^bus: q^ industria proria vel aliena ip^e terra marique lucratur, ad
libitu^ propriu^ vtitur nullius p^peditus i^iuria vel rapina, quin ad minus
i^de debitas co^seq^tur eme^das: vnde inhabita^tes terra^ illa^ locupletes
sunt, abu^da^tes auro, et arge^to, etcu^ctis necessarijs vitae. Aqua^ ip^i no^
bibu^t, nisi q^ ob deuotio^is et penite^ciae zelu^ aliqua^ do ab alijs potubus
se abstine^t. Omni genere carniu^ et pisciu^ ip^i in copia vescu^tur, q^bus
patria illa no^ modice est referta, pannis de lanis bonis ipsi induu^tur in
oi^bus operimentis suis, etiam abunda^t in lectisterniis et quo libet
suppellectili cui lana congruit in oi^bus domibus suis, nec non opulenti ipsi
sunt in o^nibus hustilimentis domus necessariis culturae, et o^nibus q^ ad
quietam, et felicem vita^ exiguntur, secundu^ status suos. Nec in placitum ipsi
ducuntur nisi coram iudicibus ordinariis, vbi illi per leges terrae just
tractantur. Nec allocuti sieve implacitati sunt de mobilibus aut possessionibus
suis, vel arrettati de crimine aliquo qualiter cu^que magno et enormi, nisi
secundum leges terrae illius, et coram iudicibus antedictis. Et hij sunt
fructus quos parit regime^ politicum et regale, ex quibus tibi iam apparent
experienciae effectus legis, quam quidam progenitorum tuorum abicere conati
sunt. Superius quoque tibi apparent effectus legis alterius, quam tanto zelo
loco legis istius, ipsi nisi sunt inducere, vt ex fructubus earum tu agnoscas
eas, et nonne ambicio, luxus, et libido, quos predicti progenitores tui regni
bono preferebant, eos ad hoc commercium concitabant? Considera igitur princeps
optime et iam alia que sequentur.

A comparison of the worthiness of both the regiments Cap. 37.
Saint Thomas in his book which he wrote to ye king of Cyprus of ye regiment
of princes, says yt ye king is geeue^ for ye kingdom, and not the kingedome
for the king. Whereupon it follows that al kingelye power must be applied to
the wealth of his kingdom. Which thing in effect consistethe in the
defense thereof from forreyne invasions, and in the mai^tenaunce of his
subjects, and their goods from the injuries and extortions of the
inhabitauntes of the same. Wherefore that king which is not hable to perform
these things, must of necessity be judged impotent and weak. But if he be so
overcome of his own affections and lustz or so oppressed with poverty, that
he can not wytheholde his hands from the pyllynge of his subjects, whereby
himself impouerisheth them and sufferethe them not to live, and to be
sustained upon their own substaunces, how much more weak or feeble is he
i^ this respect to be judged, then if he wear not hable to defend them
against the injuries of others. Truly such a king may well be called not
only feeble, but eeuen very feebleness it self: nor is not to be judged
free, beeinge tied with so many bands of feeblenes. On the other side that
king is free and of might, that is hable to defend his subjects as well
against strangers as against his own people: and also their gooddes and
possessions not only from the violente and unlawful inuasionz of their
own countreymenne and neighbors, butte also from his own oppression and
extortion, though such wilful lusts and necessities do move him to the
contrary. For who can be more mighty or more free then he that is hable to
conquer and subdue not only others but also himself?

Which thing a king whose governance is politic can do and ever does.
Thus most worthy prince it appearethe unto you by the effect of experience,
that your progenitors, which were thus minded to renounce their politic
government, could not thereby not only not obtain the might and power,
which they wished: that is to say, increase thereof, but rather they should
have endaungered and greatly hasarded the wealth as well of themselves, as
also of their kingdom. Notwithstanding these things now practiced, which
as touchi^g theffect of experience do seem to blemishe the power of a king
ruling all alone regally, never proceeded of the default of their law, but of
ye careless demeanor, and negligent lousenes of such a ruler.

Wherefore that dignity is not heareby in power imbased under the dignity of
a politic governor, which both in my foresaid treatise of the nature of
the law of nature I have plainlye proved to be in power equal.

But the premises do most euidentlye declare it to be a matter of much more
difficulty for a king whose rule is only regal to exercise his power, and
that both he and his people stand in much less security. And therefore it
were not to be wished of a wise king to change a politic regiment intoo
that government which is only regal. And according to this the foresaid
Saint Thomas wishethe that all the kingdoms of the world were ruled by
politic governance.

SAnctus Thomas in libro que^ Regi Cipri de regimine pri^cipu^ scripsit dicit:
qd' rex datur propter regnu^, etno^ regnu^ propter rege^ quo^ o^nis potestas
regia referri debet ad bonu^ regni sui, quod effectiue co^sistit in defencione
eiusdem ab exteroru^ incursibus, et in tuicione regnicolarum, et bonorum suorum
ab indigenarum iniurijs et rapinis. Quare rex quihec peragere nequit, impotens
est necessario iudicandus. Sed si ipse passionibus proprijs aut penuria ita
oppressus est, quod manus suas cohibere nequit a depilatione subditorum suoru^
quo ipsemet eos depauperat, nec viuere sinit et sustentari proprijs substantijs
suis: quanto tunc impotencior ille iudica^dus est, quam si eos defendere ipse
non sufficerent erga aliorum iniurias? Reuera rex talis nedum impotens, sed et
ipsa impotentia dicendus est, et non liber iudicari potest tantis i^potentiae
nexubus vinculatus. E regione rex liber et potens est, qui incolas suos erga
exteros et indigenas, eoru^ quo que bona et facultates nedum erga vicinorum et
conciuium rapinas defendere sufficit, sed erga proprium oppressionem, et
rapinam licet sibi passiones necessitatesque huiusmodi reluctentur. Quis enim
potentior liberiorue esse potest, quam qui non, solum alios, sed et se ipsu^
sufficit debellare? quod potest et se^per facit rex politice regens populum
suum, quare experientiae effectu tibi constat pri^ceps, progenitores tuos qui
sic politicum regimen abicere satagerunt, non solum in hoc non potuisse
nancisci potentia^ qua^ optabant, videlicet ampliorem, sed et sui bonum,
similiter et bonum Regni sui, per hoc ipsi discrimini exposuissent et periculo
gra^diori Tamen hec quae ia^ de experienciae effectu practicata, potentia^
regis regaliter tantu^ presidentis exprobrare videntur, no^ ex legis suae
defectu processeru^t, sed ex incuria neglige^tiaque taliter principa^tis, quare
ipsa dignitate^ illa^ potentia no^ minuu^t, a dignitate regis politice
regula^t' quos paris esse potentiae in predicto tractatu de natura legis
naturae luculenter ostendi. Sed pote^cia^ regis regaliter tantu^ principantis
difficilioris esse ex cercij, ac minoris securitatis sibi and populo suo, illa
clarissime iam demonstrant, quo optabile non foret regi prudenti, regimen
politicu^ pro tantum regali commutare.

vnde et sanctus Thomas supradictus, optare censetur, vt omniu^ mu^di regna
politice regerentur.

The Prince breaks the Chancellor of his tale. Cha. 38
Bear with me I beseech you good Chancellor quod the Prince, in that with my
questions I have drawn you so far from your purpose. For the things which
by this occasion you have discussed are to me right profitable, though they
have soomewhate stayed you, and pulled you back from the end of your intent.
Whereunto I pray you now make haste: and first as you promised, and as you have
begone, open unto me some other cases wherein the sentences of the laws of
England and of the Civil laws do disagree.

TVnc pri^ceps Parce obsecro Cancellarie, quod te ad tantam a proposito tuo
digressionem compuli questionibus meis, michi nanque perutilia sunt quae hac
occasion^ exarasti, licet te parumper retardauerint a meta intentionis tuae, ad
quam vt tu ia^ celerius properes flagito, et primo vt aliquos alios casus, in
quibus legum Angliae et Ciuilium discrepant sentenciae, vt promisisti et
cepisti, mihi enarres.

The second case, wherein the Civil laws, and the laws of England disagree
in their judgments. Chap. 39.
ACcording to your request most noble prince (quod ye Chancellor) I will open
unto you certain other cases wherein the said laws disagree. Howbeit
whether of the same laws in their iugements excels ye other, yt will I
leave to your own determination. The Civil law does legittimate the child
borne before matrimony as well as yt which is borne after: and gives unto it
succession in ye parents inheritance. But to the child borne out of matrimonye
the law of England allows no succession, affirmynge it to be natural
only and not lawful. The Ciuilia^s in this case auaunce their law-alleginge
that by mean thereof the sacrament or state of matrimony coming in place,
extinguishethe the former sin, whereby eles the sowles of twoe persons
should have perished. And it is to be presumed, say they that they were at
their first copulation both so minded as the sacrament ensuynge afterward
declares. The church also accepts such children for legittimate. These I
trow are the iii. strongest reasons, whereby they maintain and defend their
law. Which are thus answered by the lawyers of England. First they say that
the sin of the first carnal accion in ye case propounded is not purged by
the matrimony ensuynge, though by the woorthynes thereof the sinners
punishment is somewhat abated. They say also that they which thus do sin
are somuche ye less repentaunt therefore, in as much as they perceive the
laws to favor and bear with such tra^sgressours. And upon this
consideration they are made the redyer to commit the sin: thereby breakinge
the commandment both of god and of the church. Wherefore this law does
not only participate with the offense of sinners, but also swarueth from the
nature of a good law. Forasmuch as a law is a holy stablishement, co^ma^ding
things honest, and forbiddynge the contrary. Which this law does not, but
rather allureth ye minds of sinners to dishonestye. Neither can it be any
defense to this law, that the church accepts such children for
legittimate. For that loving mother dispenses in many things, which she
licenceth to be done And it was by way of dispensacion that the Apostle set
virgins at liberty, whereunto he would not counsel them, rather wyshinge all
to continue virgins like himself. And god forbid that so great a mother
should in this case wythdrawe her tender love from her children, which by the
inticement of this law do many times fall into sin.

And by the matrimonye ensuynge the church is infourmed that the parties so
marrieng are penitent and sorry for the offense passed, and are willinge in time
to come through matrimony to live contine^t. But the law of England in this
case woorketh a much contrary effect.

For it prouokethe not to sin, nor cherishethe or mainteineth sinners, but
puts them in fear, and to keep them from sin threatens punishment. For
the wantonness of the flesh has no need of allurement, but rather of
discouragement: because the lusts of the flesh are wanton, and almost
vntamable. And forasmuch as it is impossible for man to live ever in himself,
he naturallye coueteth to live ever in his like, because every living thing,
desires to be like ye first and chief cause, which is perpetual and
everlasting. And hereof it commethe that man has more delight and pleasur^ in
the sense of feeling, whereby his kind is preserved, tha^ in the sense of taste,
which preserves only the particular man. Wherefore Noe executinge vengeance
upon his son which uncovered his priuities, did curse his nephewe the
offenders child, that thereby the offendoure might be more grieved then with
his own mishappe. Wherefore ye law that punishes the offenders issue does
more penallye prohibit sin. then that which plageth but the offendour
alone. Whereby it may easelye be considered with what zeal the law of
England abhors unlawful coniu^ctions, which does not only judge the
child so gotten to be illegittimate but also prohibiteth it to succeed in the
parents inheritance. Is not this law then chaste and pure? And does it not
more forceably and more earnestlye suppress sin, then the foresaid Civil
law, which winketh at the sin of lechery, and leueth it unpunished?

CAncellarius. Quosda^ casus alios in quibus dissentiunt leges predictae, vt
petis princeps, detegere conabor. Sed tamen quae legu^ earu^ prestantior sit in

Special causes why base borne children are not legittimate in England by
matrimony ensuing. Chap. 40.
MOre over the Civil laws say yt your natural or bastard son is ye son of
ye people. Whereof a certain metricia^ writes in this wise.

To whom the people father is, to hi^ is father none and all. To whom the
people father is, well fatherles we may him call. And while such a child had
no father at ye time of his birthe, surely nature knows not how he could
afterward come by a father. For if one woman should bear two children of twoe
fornicatours, and the one of them should afterward marrye her: Whether of
these twooe children should by this marriage be legittimat? Oppinio^ may
somewhat persuade, but reason cannot find: seeing the time was once when both
those children beeinge judged the children of the people, did not know their
fathers It were therefore unreasonable that a child afterward borne in the
same wedlock, whose generation cannot be unknown should be disherited, and
that a child which knows no father should be heir to the father and mother
of the other, specially in ye roialme of England where the eldest son only
enioieth the fathers inheritance. And an indifferent judge would think it no
less unreasonable, that a base borne child should be equally matched with a
lawful begotten child in ye inheritance which by the Civil laws can be
divided but only among male children. For saint Augustine in the xvi. book
de Ciuitate dei wrytethe thus. Abraham gave all his substance to his son
Isaac: and to the sons of his concubines he gave gifts. Whereupon seems to
be meant, that to bastard children there is noe inheritance due, but only a
necessary lyuinge. Thus says he And under the name of a bastard child saint
Auste^ understands all unlawful yssues: and so does holy scripture also i^
diverse places, calling none by the name of a bastard. Lo, Saint Austen
thinkethe no small difference to be, and so thinks Abraham to, between the
succession of a bastard, and of a son lawfullye begotten. Yea holy
scripture reprehendeth all unlawful children under this metaphore, saying
Bastard slippes shall take no deep root nor lay any fast foundation, in the
iiii. chapter of the book of wisdom. The church also reproves the same in
that it admits them not to holy orders. And if it so be that the church
do dyspense with such a one, yet it permits not him to have any dignitye
or preeminence in ye church Wherefore it is conuenyent that man's law in the
benefit of succession should cut the^ short, whom the Church judges
unworthy to be received into holy orders, and rejects from all prelacie:
yea whom holy scripture judges, as touching their birthe, much inferior to
them that be lawfullye begotten. We read that Gedeon the puissaunt begat lxx.
sons in wedlock, and but one only out of wedlock. Yet this misbegotten
child wyckedlye slew all those lawfullye beegotten children one only
excepted. Judges.ix. Whereby it is perceived that there was more wickedness in
one bastard child, then in.lxix. lawful sons. For it is a commen saying:
If a bastard be good, yt comes to him by chance, that is to wit, by
special grace, but if he be evil that comes to him by nature. For it is
thought that the base child draws a certain corruption and stayne from ye
sin of his parents, without his own fault, as all we have received of ye
sin of our first parents much infection, though not somuche. Howebeit the
blemishe which bastardes by their generation do receive much differs from
that werein lawful children are borne. For their conception is wrought by the
mutual synnefull lust of both parents, which in the laufull and chaste
copulations of married couples takes no place. The sin of such fornicatours
is committed by ye mutual consent of them both. Wherefore it is likened to
the first sin, and cleaves more cruelly to the child, then the sin of
such as do otherwise offend alone: so that the child so begotten deserves
to be called the child of sin, rather then the child of sinners. wherefore
the book of wysedo^ making a difference between these ii. gen^atio^s of ye
laufull gen^atio^ it sayethe thus. O how fair is a chaste generacio^ with
virtue. The memorial thereof is immortal: for it is known with god and with
men. But the other is not known with men so that the children there of borne
are called ye children of the people. Of which base generation the same book
thus speaks: All the children that are borne of wicked pare^tz are witnesses
of wyckednes against their pare^tz when they be asked. For bei^ge demanded of
their parentz, they open their sin, even as the wicked son of Noe uncovered
his fathers priuities. It is therefore believed touchi^ge the bli^de borne of
whom the pharasiez in the ix chapter of Saint John's gospel said: Thou art
altogether borne in si^ne: yt he was a bastard, who wholly is borne of sin.
And where it folowethe: do not thou teach us. It seems that thereby may
be understood, yt a bastard has no like natural disposition to knowledge
and learning as a lawful child has. Wherefore that law makes no good
division which in the fathers inheritance makethe equal bastard children and
laufull children, who^ ye church in gods inheritance makes unequal. Between
whom also scripture puts a difference in form above mentioned: and who^
nature in her gifts seuereth, markynge the natural or bastard children as it
were with a certain prive mark i^ their souls Whether therefore of ye ii.
laws English or civil do you now embrace most noble prince, and judge to
have the preeminence in this case.

The prince allows the law which does not legittimat children borne before
matrimony. Cap. 41.
Surely even to that law do I geeue the preferment, quod the prince, which is
of more force to abando^ sin out of the royalme, and to auaunce virtue. Those
also in the benefits of man's law do I suppose abject and base, whom the law
of god consydereth unworthy, and who^ the church in her benefits rejects and
nature also judges more prone unto sin. I think you do not judge amysse,
quod the Chau^cellour. wherefore I will rehearse yet other cases, wherein the
said laws disagree.

PRinceps, Reuera eam que fortius a regno peccatum eliminat, et firmius in eo
virtutem conseruat. Arbitror etia^ illos in legis humanoe bn^ficiis minorandos,
quos lex diuina indigniores co^siderat, et quos postponit ecclesia in

Recte estimo te se^tire quare et casus alios memorabor, i^ quibus discrepant
hec leges duae.

The third case wherein the laws aforesaid disagree. Cap. 42.
The Civil laws decre that the issue ever follows the womb, that is to
say, the mother. As for example, if a bo^d woman be married to a freman, their
issue shall be bond. And contrariwise if a bond man marry a free woman, he
begets none but free children But the law of England never judges the issu
to follow the mothers condition, but always the fathers. So that a free man
begets free children as well of a bond woman as of a free woman: and a bo^de
man in wedlock ca^ beget no^e other but bo^d children. Whether of these laws
is better think you in theier sentences. It is a cruel law which without
offense subdueth the free man's child to bondage. And no less cruelty is to
be thought in ye law, which without any deserte oppresses the free womans
child with bondage. Yet the Ciuilia^s say that ye Civil laws in these their
judgments do excel. For an evil tree say they can not bring furthe good
fruits, nor a good tree bear evil fruits. And by the co^se^t of all laws
it is agreed that every plant yeldeth to the nature of ye ground wherein it
is planted the child also has much more certei^ and sure knowledge of ye
mother the^ of ye father, Whereunto the lawyers of England au^swer on this
wise: That a child laufully begotten has no more certain and sure knowledge of
ye mother then of the father For both these laws thus disagreeynge, agree yet
in this point, that he is the father, who^ wedlock declares. And is it not
then more convenient yt the condition of the child should have relation rather
to the fathers condition, then to the mothers. Seeing that Adam speaki^ge of
married couples, said* They shall be ii. in one flesh. which our lord
expoundynge in the gospel sayethe: Now are they not ii. but one flesh And
for so much as ye mal' as more worthi co^teineth the female, then the whole flesh
so united must have relation to the male as to the worthyer. wherefore the
lord called Adam and Eve not by the name of Eve, but because they were both
one flesh, he called them both in the name of Adam the man, as it apeareth in
ye fifthe chapter of genesis. The Civil laws also hold that women do ever
glister with the shyenynge beams of their husbands Wherefore in the title
beginning with these words: Qui se prosessione excusant, in ye nynth book L.
fi. the text says thus. we auaunce women with the honor of their husbands,
and with the ki^red of their husbands we worship the^: in ye court we decree
matters to pass in the name of their husbands, and into ye house and surname
of their husbands do we translate them. But if afterward a woman marrye with a
man of baser degree, the^ leseth she her former dignity, and follows the
co^dicio^ of her latter husband And forsomuche as all children, specially male
children bear the fathers name, and not the mothers, whereof then should it
come, that ye son by reason of the mother should lose the honor, or change
the condition of the father whose name nevertheless he shall still keep.
Specially seeing the mother herself receaueth of the same father honor,
worship, and dignity. which honor, worship, and dignity of the husband
ca^ never be disteined or i^peached through ye fault of the wife. Truly that
law may well be demed cruel, which with out any cause co^mittethe to bondage
the free ma^s son, and which disheritinge the innocent son of the i^nocent
free father adiudgeth his land to an unworthy stranger: which also with ye
base state of bondage in ye son defaceth the name of the free father. Cruel
also of necessite must that law be compted, which augmenteth thraldom, and
diminishes liberty or freedom. For liberty is ye thing that ma^s nature
ever coueteth. For by man and for sin did bondage first enter. But freedom
is graffed in man's nature of god. whereof if men be deprived, he is ever
disierous to recover ye same again, like as all other things do that are
spoiled of their natural liberty. wherefore wicked and cruel is he to be
deemed that favors not liberty. which things the laws of England duly
consydering, do in all respects show favor to liberty. And though the same
laws judge hi^ thrall, whom a boundeman i^ wedlock begets of a free woman,
yet here by ca^ not these laws be reputed severe and cruel For a woman which
by marriage has submitted herself to a boundeman, is made one flesh with him.
wherefore, as ye forsaid laws determine, she follows the state of his
condition, and of her own free will has made her self a bond woman, not
forced thereto by the law much like to such as in kings courts become
bondemen, or sell the^selfs into bondage without any compulsio^ at all. And
how then can the law determine that child to be free, whom such a mother
has thus borne. For the husband can never be in so much subjection to his
wife, though she be a right great lady, as this woman is subject to the
bondeman, whom she has made her lord: insomuche as ye lord says to al
wifes Thou shall be under the power of thy husbonde, and he shall have dominion
over thee. And what is it that these Ciuilians say of the fruit of a good or
evil tree. Is not every wife of a fre or thral condition according to y^
state of her husband And in whose ground has yt husband planted, while his
wife is one flesh with him. Not in his own? And what the^ if he have graffed a
slyppe of a sweet nature i^ a stock of a sower tree: So yt ye tree be his own,
shall not the fruits, though they eu^ sauer of the stock, be his own
fruits? So the child which the wife bareth is the husbands issue, whether
the wife be free or thrall. Howbeit ye laws of England decree that if a bond
woman without the co^se^t of her lord be married to a free man, though they
can not be deuorced, because the gospel says, whom god has conjoined let
not man separate, yet shall her lord recover against the same free man all the
damages that he has sustained by reason of the loss of his vassal or bond
woman. This now as I suppose is the sum and fourm of the law of England in
the case now declared, What therefore is your opinion most excellent prince in
the same case?

And whether of these two laws do you esteem to be of more worthiness and
excellencye.

The fowerth case wherein the said laws vary Cap. 44.
THe Civil laws commit the tuition of orphans to the next of their blood,
whether the kindred grow on the fathers side or on the mothers side, that is to
say, to every man according to the degree and order, wherein his turn is
next to succeed the pupille in his inhertiau^ce. And the reason of this law
is that: that no man will beehaue him self more tenderly or more favorably in
the careful education of the infaunte, then he that is next of his blood.
Nevertheless the laws of England touching the custody of orphans do determine
much otherwise For there if an inheritance beeinge holden in sorage descend
to an orphane from any of the kynred of his fathers side, the same orphane
shall not be under the keeping of any of that kynred, but he shall be governed
by his cosins or kynesfolke of his mothers side. And if the inheritance come
to him from any kinesman of his mothers side, then the pupil with his
inheritance shall be in the custody till he come to lawefull age of him
that is next of his kynne of his fathers side and not of any kynesman of the
mothers side. For our laws say, that to commit ye tuition of an i^fa^t to him
yt shall next succeed him, is like as if one should beetake a lamb unto a
woulfe to be devoured. Butte if the inheritance be not holden in socage, but
by knights feruyce, then by the laws of the same land the child with his
inheritance shall be in the keepinge of none of his kynred of neither side,
but in the custody of the lord of the fee until he come to ye age of one
and twenty years. And think you that any man can or will better instruct and
train up the child in feats of arms, which bye reason of his tenure he is
bound to yield to ye lord of his fee, then ye lord himself, to whom such
service is by him due? Which is also to be judged of more power, and honor
then the friends and kynesfolkes of his tenant. For he to the intent he
may in time to come be the better served of his tenaunte will use the more
diligence toward him. And it is to be presumed that he is more expert and
skylfull to trade him in this things, then his other friends rude peradventure
and unpracticed in martial feats specially if his patrimony be but small.
And what can be more profitable for the child, which by reason of his tenure
shall in the service of his lord endaunger his life, and all that he has in
the acts of chiualrye, the^ in his nonage to be brought up in the
discipline and practice of the same, seeing that in his ripe age he shall not
be hable to avoid the adventure thereof? And to say the truethe it shall be
no small commodity for the royalme, yt the inhabiters of the same be well
expert in the knowledge of arms. For as says the philosopher, every man
does the thing boldelye, wherein he assures himself to be skylfull. And do
you not the^ most noble prince allow this law and commend it above the other
now described.

LEges Ciuiles impuberum tu^ telas, proximis de eoru^ sanguine co^mittunt,
agnati fuerint seu cognati, vnicuique videlicet secundum gradum et ordinem quo
in hereditate pupilli successurus est. Et racio legis huius est quia nullus
tenerius fauorabilibusue infantem alere sataget, quam proximus de sanguine
eius. Tamen long aliter de impuberu^ custodia statuunt leges Angliae. Na^
ibidem, si hereditas quae tenetur in Socagio, descendat impuberi ab aliquo
agnatoru^ suorum, non-erit impubes ille sub custodia alicuius agnatorum eius.
Sed per ipsius cognatos, videlicet consanguineos ex part matris, ip^e regetur.
Et si ex part cognatoru^ hereditas sibi descenderit, pupillus ille cu^
hereditate sua per proximum agnatu^ et no^ cognatum eius custodiet'. Quousque
ip^e fuerit adultus.

Na^ leges illae dicu^t qd' co^mittere tutela^ i^fa^tis illi q^ est ei^ proxime
successurus, est quasi agnu^ co^mittere lupo ad deuora^du^. Sed si hereditas
illa non in socagio, sed teneatur per seruiciu^ milita', tu^c per leges terrae
illius, i^fa^s ipse et hereditas eius, no^ per agnatos neque cognatos, sed per
dn^m feodi illius custodie^tur, quousque ip^e fuerit etatis vigi^ti et vnius
a^noru^. Quis putas infante^ tale^ in actibus bellicis quos facere ratio^e
tenurae suae ipse astringitur dn^o feodi sui, melius instruere poterit, aut
velit quam dn^s ille, eui ab eo seruicium tale debetur? et qui maioris
potentiae et honoris estimatur. q^ sunt alij amici et propinq^ tenentis sui?
Ipse na^que, vt sibi ab eode^ tenente melius seruiatur, diligentem curam
adhibebit, et melius in his eu^ erudire expertus esse censetur, quam reliqui
amici iuuenis, rudes forsa^ et armoru^ inexperti, maxim si no^ magnu^ fuerit
patrimoniu^ eius. Et quid vtilius est infanti qui vitam et omnia sua periculis
bellicis exponet in seruicio domini sui ratio^e tenurae suae, quam in militia
actubusque bellicis imbui, dumminor est, cum actus huiusmodi ipse in etate
matura declinare non poterit. Et reuera non minime erit regno accomodum, vt
incolae eius in armis sint experti. Nam vt dicit Philo. audacter quilibet
facit, qd' se scire ipse non defidit. Nunquid tunc legem hanc tu approbas fili
regis, et collaudas super legem alteram iam descriptam.

Here the prince comme^deth the education of noble men's children being
orphans. Cap. 45.
YEs good Chauncelour, quod ye prince, this law I do allow much more the^ the
other. For in the first part of it which you noted, it provides much more
waryly for the security and saufegarde of the pupil, then the Civil law
does. Howbeit in the second part of the same I do take more delight. For
thereof it comethe to pass that in England noble men's children can not
easelye degenerate, butte rather pass and surmou^t their ancestors in
virtue, in courage, and in honest conditions, forsomuche as theye are brought
up and instructed in an higher and an honorabler court, then in the houses of
their parents, though their parents wear paraduenture brought up in the
like places. For their parents house was never yet like the lords house,
whom as well the parents, as also the children served. The princes also of
the royalme being ruled bye this law, and likewise other lords holding
their land immedyatlye of the king, can not lightlye fall to wantonness and
vnseemelynes, seeing that in their childehoode, while theye be orphans they
are brought up in the kings house. Wherefore I must needs highelye praise
and co^me^^^ ye riches, and high port of the kings court, in that it is the
chiefest schole within the royalme for the nobilitye of the land. It is also
the scholehouse of manhood, of virtue, and of good manners, whereby the royalm
is honored and flourishes and is preserved against invasions: so yt it is
dreaded both of friends and foes. And to be plain this great commodity
could not have happened to the royalme, if noble men's children beeinge orphans
and pupilles had been nourished and brought up by the poor friends of
their parents. Neither can this be prejudicial or hurtefull to the wealth
of the royalme, that the children of burgeses, and of other freeholders, which
hold their tenementes in socage, and are not thereby bound to warfare, are
brought up in the houses of their like friends, as to him yt shall thoroughly
weigh the matter it may evidently appear.

PRinceps. Immo Cancellarie legem hanc, plusqua^ alteram, ego laudo. Nam in
eius part prima, quam tu notasti, caute magis quam ciuilis ipsa prouidet
securitati pupilli. Sed tamen in eius part secunda, multo magis ego delector.
Nam ab ea est quod in Anglia, nobilium progenies de facili degenerari
nonpotest, sed probitate potius, strenuitate, et morum honestate antecessores
suos ipsa transcendet, dum in altiori, nobiliorique curia, qua^ in domo
parentum illa sit imbuta, licet indomo consimili forsan parents eius educati
erant: Quia consimilis adhuc non erat, domus parentum illorum domui dominorum,
quibus ip^i parents et ipsi infa^te^ seruierunt.

Principes quoque regni sub hac lege regulati, similiter et domini alii a rege
i^mediate tene^tes, non possu^t deleui in lasciuiam ruditat en^ie l^bi, cum in
pueritiadum orphani fuerint ipsi, in domo regia nutriuntur. Quare non i^nmo
domus regiae opulentia^ magnitudine^que collaudo, du^ in ea ginpnasiu^
supremu^, sit nobilitates regn^ Scholaquo que strenuitatis, probitatis et moru^
quibus regnum honoratur, et florebit, ac contra irruentes securatur, etia^
formido ipsa erit inimicis et amicis regni. Hoc reuera bonu^ accidisse no^
potuisset regno illi, si nobilium filij, orphani et pupilli, per pauperes
amicos parentum suorum nutrirentur. Nec regni bono officere potest, licet
burge^tium filij et alioru^ libere tenentium q^ in socagio tene^t teneme^ta
sua, quo ip^i ad militia^ non astringu^tur, in domo consimiliu^ amicoru^ suoru^
educantur vt perspicue considera^ti lucide apparere potest.

Yet he rehearses other case^ wherein the forsaid laws differ. Cap. 46
THere be yette diverse other cases, quod the Chaunceloure, wherein the laws
aforesaid do varye. As in that the Civil laws do judge open theft to be
satisfied by the recompense of four fold, and priuye theft by the recompense
of double. Butte the laws of England suffer neither of those offenses to be
more fauorablye punished then with the offenders death, so that the value of
the thing stolen be above the value of twelve pe^ce. Also a libertine that is
to say, a free man that sometime was bond, if he beecome unkind or
churlishe, the Civil laws reduce him into his former state of servitude
again. But by the laws of England he that is once made free, be he grate or
ingrate, is aiudged to enjoy his freedom still. There be other like cases
also not a few, which at this time for breuities sake I ouerpasse. Neither
in these two cases do I dispute the excellencye of the foresaid laws,
seeing the qualities of the^ requier no great search. And I doubt not but
the quicknes of your wit is such, yt it can sufficiently discuss the same.

TVnc Ca^cellarius. Su^t et alij casus no^nulli i^ quibus differu^t leges
antedictae, Vt qia leges Ciuiles iudica^t furtu^ manifestu^ per reddicio^e^
quadrupli, et furtu^ no^ manifestu^, per dupli reco^pensatione^ expiari. Sed
leges Angliae, neutrum facinorum illoru^ mitius quam committentis morte puniri
permittunt dummodo ablati valor duodecim denarioru^ valore^ excedat. Ite^
libertinum ingratum leges ciuiles in pristina^ redigu^t seruitutem: sed leges
Angliae semel manumissu^, semper liberum iudicant gratum et ingratum. Alij
quoque sunt casus huiusce modi non pauci, quos iam studio breuitatis pretereo
Et neque in hijs duobus casibus predictarum legum prestancias ego ia^ describo,
cum no^ magu^ sit i^daginis eorum qualitates nec diffido ingenij tui solerciam
eas sufficie^ter posse rimari.

The prince regardethe not the cases now rehearsed. Cap. 47.
NO nor it booteth not good Chauncelloure herein much to tarry, quod the
prince. For though in England as well open as pryuy thieves are commenlye put
to death, yette cease they not there from stealing, as though theye had
no fear of so great a punishemente. How much less then would they wtholde
their hands from theft if they foresaw once yt ye punishment were mitigated?
And godde forbid that he which once has escaped miserable servitude should
ever after tremble and quake at the threatenings of bondage, specially under
the color of ingratitude or unkindness seeing the kinds of ingratitude are
so many that they can skante well be numbered: and man's nature in the cause of
liberty or freedom more then in other causes requires favor. Wherefore at
this time, good Chancellor I beseech you hartelye meddle no more with the
examination of any such cases. But now explane and open unto me why ye laws of
England being so good so fruitful, and so commodious, are not taught in the
universities, as the Civil and Cannon laws are, and why in the same none are
commenced bachelors and doctors as in other faculties and sciences it is
accustomed.

PRinceps. Nec expedit Cancellarie in hijs multum suadere quia licet in Anglia,
fures clandestini et manifesti passim morti plectantur, non cessant ipsi ibidem
omnino p^dari ac si penam tantam illiminime formidarent. Qua^to tunc minus se
abstinere^t a crimi^e si penam preuiderent mitiorem? Et absit a seruitute semel
euasum, semper deinde sub minis tremere seruitutis, maxim ingratitudinis
color, cum ingratitudinum species, vix poterint pre multitudine numerari et
humana natura in libertatis causa, fauorem semper magis quam in causis alijs
deprecetur. Sed iam Cancellarie, obnixe te imploro, vt amodo amisso plurium
casuum huiusmodi examine, michi edicas, quare leges Angliae tam bonae, frugi,
et optabiles in vniuersitatibus no^ doce^tur, vt Ciuiles similiter et canonu^
leges: et quare in eisde^ no^ dantur baccalariatus et doctoratus gradus vt in
alijs facultatibus et scie^tijs est dari co^suetum.

Here the Chauncelour shows why the laws of England are not taught in the
universities. Cap. 48.
In the universities of England, quod the Chancellor, sciences are not
taught butte in the latin tongue. And the laws of that land are to be learned
in three several tongues, to wit, in the English tongue, ye french tongue,
and ye latin tongue. In the English tongue, because that law is most used,
and longest continued amongst the English men. In the French tongue, because
that after the French men under William the conqueror of England had
obtained the land, they suffered not their men of law to plead their causes,
but in the tongue whi^he theye knew, and so do all the men of law in France
yea in the course of parliament there. Likewise the Frenchemen after their
coming into England received not the acco^ptes of their revenues, but i^ their
own language, least theye should be deceived therein Neither had they delight to
hunte, and to exercise other sportes and pastimes, as diceplaye, and the hand
balle, but in their own proper tongue. Wherefore ye English me^ by much using
of their company, grew in such a perfectnes of the same language, ye at this
day in such plays and accomptes they use the French tongue. And theye wear
wont to plead in French, till by force of a certain statute that manner was
much restreyned. But it could never hither to be whollye abolished, as well by
reason of certain terms, which pleaders do more properly express in French,
then in English, as also for that declarations ^ppon original wryttes can
not be pronounced so agreably to the nature of those writtes as in French.
And under the same speech the fourmes of such declaracions are learned.
Moreover all pleas, argueynges, and judgments passed in the kings courts and
entered into books for the instruction of them that shall come after, are ever
more reported in the French tongue. Many statutes also of that royalme are
written in French. Whereof it happens that the comme^ speech now used in
France agreethe not, nor is not like the French used among the lawyers of
England, butte is by a certain rudenes of the common people corrupt.

Which corruption of spech chances not in ye French that is used in England,
for so much as that spech is there oftener written then spoken. Now in the
third of the said iii. tongues, which is the latin tongue are written all
writtes original and judicial: and likewise all the records of plees in the
kings courts, with certain statutes also.

Wherefore while ye laws of England are learned in these three tongues, they
cannot conveniently be taught or studied in ye universities, where only ye
latin tongue is exercised. Notwtstandinge the same laws are taught and
learned in a certain place of public or comen study more convenient and apt
for attaining to ye knowledge of them, then any other university.

For this place of study is situate nighe to ye kingez courts where the same
laws are pleaded and argued, and judgments by the same geeuen by judges
men of grauytie, ancient in years, perfect and graduate in the same laws.
Wherefore every day in court the students in those laws resort by great
numbers unto those courts, wherein the same laws are read and taught as it
were in common schools.

This place of study is set between ye place of ye said courtz and ye City of
London, which of al things necessary is ye ple^tifullest of all ye cities and
towns of ye realm So yt ye said place of study is not situate wtin ye city,
where the confluence of people might disturb the quietness of the students but
somewhat several in the suburbs of the same City, and nigher to the said
courts, that the students may daily at their pleasure have access and
recourse thither without wearines.

Here he declares the disposition of the general study of the laws of
England, and that the same in number of students passes certain
universities. Cha. 49.
But to ye intent most excellent prince ye may conceive a form and an image
of this study, as I am able I will discribe it unto you. For there be in it
ten lesser housez or ynnes, and sometimes more, which are called ynnes of the
Chauncery. And to every one of them belongs a C. studients at the least, and
to some of them a much greater number, though they be not ever all together
in the same. These students, for the most part of the^, are yongmen, lerning
or studying ye originals, and as it were ye elements of ye law. who profiting
therein, as they grow to rypenes, so are they admitted into ye greater ynnes
of the same study, called ynnes of court. Of the which greater ynnes there
are.iiii. in number. And to the lest of them beelongeth in form above
mentioned twooe hundrethe Students or theareaboutes.

For in these greter ynnez there can no studient be maintained for less
expe^ses by the year then xx. marks. And if he have a servant to wait upon
him, as most of the^ have then so much the greater will his charges be. Now
be reason of this charges the children only of noble men do study the
laws in those ynnes.

For the poor and commen sort of the people are not hable to bear so great
charges for the exhibition of their children And merchant men can
seeledoome find in their hearts to hinder their merchandise with so great
yerly expenses. And thus it falls out yt there is scant any manne found
within ye roialme skillful and conning in the laws, except he be a
gentleman borne, and come of a noble stock.

Wherefore they more then any other kind of men have a special regard to
their nobility, and too the preservation of their honor and fame And to
speak uprightly there is in these greater ynnes, yea and in the lesser too,
beside the study of the laws, as it were an university or schole of all
commendable qualities requisite for noble men. There they learn to singe, and
to exercise themselfes in all kind of armony. There also they practice
daunsing, and other noble men's pastimes, as they use to do which are brought
up in the kings house.

On the woorkyedayes the most part of them apply themselves to the study of
the law. And on the holyedayes to the study of holy scripture: and out of
the time of divine service to the reading of chronicles. For there in deed are
virtues studied, and all vices exiled. So that for the endowement of virtue,
and abandoning of vice Knights and Barons, with other states and noble men
of the roialme place their children in those ynnes, though they desire not to
have them learned in the laws, nor to live by the practice thereof, but only
upon their fathers allowaunce.

Skante at any time is there hard among them any sedition, chiding or
grudginge. And yet the offenders are punished with none other pain, but
only to be amoued from the company of their fellowship. Which punishment
they do more fear, then other criminal offenders do fear imprisonment and
yrons.

For he that is ones expelled from any of those felowships is never received
to be a fellow in any of the other felowshippes And so by this means there is
continual peace: and their demeanor is like the behavior of such as are
coupled together in perfect amity. But after what manner and sort the laws
are learned i^ those ynnes, thereof here too make rehersall, it is not
needeful, forsomuche as it is not for your estat most noble Prince to put the
same in ure. Yet know ye this, that it is pleasant and delectable, and in any
wise expedient for the learning of the law, and worthy with all affection to
be embraced. But one thing there is that I would have you to know, that
neither at Orleaunce, where as well the Canon as the Ciuyle laws are taught,
and whether out of many Countries scholars do repair, nor at Angeo, or at
Cane, or any university of France (Paris only excepted) are found so many
students past chyldhoode, as in this place of study, notwtstanding yt al ye
stude^tes there are English borne.

Of the estate and degree af a Seriant at law, and how he is ereated, Cap. 50.
But for so much as you desire to know, most gracious Prince, for what cause the
degrees of bachelars and doctors are not geeuen in the laws of England, as
they are accustomablye geeuen in both laws within universities, your
majesty shall understand that though these degrees are not geeuen in the
laws of England, yet there is geeuen in them not a degree only, but also a
state no less worshipful and solemn then the degree of doctors: which is
called the degree of a Seriant at law. And it is given under the manner and
form fo^owyng. The lord chief Justice of the commen benche by ye counsel
and assent of all the Justices uses as often as he thinks good to chose vii.
or.viii. of the discreetest persons, that in the foresaid general study
have most profited in the laws, and which to the same Iusticez are thought to
be of best disposition, and their names he presents to the lord Chancellor
of England in writtynge. Who incontinent by virtue of the kings write shall
charge every of the persons elect to be before the king at a day by him
assigned, too take upon him the state and degree of a serieaunt at law, under
a great penalty in every of the said writtes limited. On the which day
every one of them appearing shall be sworn upon the holy gospel of God to be
ready at the day and place then to be appointed to receive the state and
degree aforesaid, and that he the same day shall geeue gold according to
the custom in that behalf used.

How be it how and after what sort every of the said chosen persons
shall that day demean himself, and also the form and manner how that state
and degree shall be given and receued, forsomuche as the same can not so
briefelye be written as to the shortness of this work is requisite, therefore
at this time, I will leave these points untouched. And yet I have declared the
same to you ere now by way of talk. But this you must understand, that when
the day appoi^ted is come, those elect persons among other solemnities must
keep a great dinner, like to the feast of a kings coronation, which shall
continue and last by ye space of seven days. And none of those elect persons
shall defraye ye charges growinge to him about ye costs of this solempnitie
with less expenses then the sum of four hundredth marks So that ye expe^ses
which viii. men so elect shall then beestowe will surmount the sum of
three thousand and two hundredth ma^ks. Of ye which expenses one parcel shall
be this. Every of them shall give ringes of gold to ye value of xl. pounds
sterling at the least. And your Chancellor well reme^brethe that at what time
he received this state and degree, ye ringez which he then gave stood him in
fifty pounds.

For every such serieant at the time of his creacion uses to geeue unto
every Prince, Duke, and archbishop being present at that solempnitie, and to
the lord Chancellor and Lord Treaseroure of England a ringe of the valu
of.xxvi. shillings viii.d. And to every earl and bishop beeinge likewise
present, and also to the Lord privy seal, to both ye lords chief Justices,
and to the Lord chief baron of the kings exchequer a ringe of the value of
xx.s. And to every lord baron of the parliament and to every abbott, and
notable prelate, and worshipful knight being then present, and also to ye
master of the roles, and to every Justice a ring of ye value of a mark And
likewise to every baron of ye exchequer, to the chaumberlaines, and to all the
officers, and notable men serving in the kings courts, ringes of a smaller
price, but agreeable to their estates to whom they are given. Insomuch yt
there shall not be a clerk, specially in the court of the commen benche, but
he shall receive a ring convenient for his degree. And besides these they geeue
diverse rings too other of their fryndes. They give also liueries of cloth of
one suit or color in great abundaunce not only to their household meanye,
but also to their other fryndes and acquaintance, which during the time of
the foresaid solempnytye shall attend and wait upon them.

Wherefore though in the Universities they that are promoted too the degree of
Doctors do sustai^ no small charges at the time of their co^me^ceme^t, as in
geui^ge of bonnetes and other rich gifts, yet yey give no gold: nor do
bestow any other gifts or costs like unto these expenses. Neither i^ any
country of the world is there any special degree given in the laws of the sa^e
land, but only in ye royalme of England. Neither is there any man o^ law
through out the universal world, which by reason of his office or profession
gaynethe so much as one of these seriaunts. No man also be he never so conning
and skylfull in the laws of the royalme shall be exalted to ye office and
dignity of a Justice in the court of pleas before the ki^ge or i^ ye court
of the co^me^ bench, which are the chief ordinary courts of the same
royalme, oneles he be first promoted to the state and degree of a seriaunt at
law. Neither shall any man but only such a seriaunt plead in the court of yt
commen benche, wheare all real actions are pleaded. Wherefore to this state
and degree has no man been hitherto admitted, except he have first continued
by the space of xvi years in the said general study of ye law. And in token
or sign that all Justices ar thus graduat every of them always while he
sytteth i^ ye kings courts, wears a white quoyfe of silk: which is the
principal and chief in signemet of habit where with seriauntes at law in
their creation are decked. And neither the Justice, nor yet the seriaunt shall
ever put of ye quoyfe no not in the kings presence, though he be in talk
with his majesty's highness. wherefore, most noble prince, you can not
hereafter doubt, but that these laws, which so singularli above the Civil
laws, yea and above the laws of all other royalmes are honored, and with so
solemn a state of such as are learned therein, and do profess ye sa^e are
worshipped must needs be precious, noble and hieghe, and of great
excellency, and of special knowledge and virtue.

After what manner a Justice is created, and of his habit and conversation.
Cap. 51
But to the intent the state of Justices as well as of seriauntes at law may
be known to your grace, as I ca^ I will describe unto you their form and
office. In the commen be^che there are custumable v. Justices or vi. at the
most. And in the kings benche.iiii. or v. And as often as the place of any of
them by death or otherwise is void, ye king uses to choose one of the
seriauntes at law and him by his letters patents to ordeine a Justice in the
place of the judge so ceassynge. And the^ the lord Chauncellor of England
shall enter into ye court where the Justice is so lacking, bryngyng with him
those letters patents, and sittynge in ye mids of the Justices, causes the
seriau^t so elect to be brought in, to who^ in the open court he notifieth the
kings pleasure touching the office of the justice then void and causes the
foresaid letters to be openly read. Which do^e the master of the rolls shall
read before the same elect person the oath that he shall take. Which when he
has sworn upon the holy gospel of god, the lord Chau^cellour shall deliver
unto him the kings letters aforesaid. And the lord chief Justice of yt
court shall assine unto him a place in the same, where he shall then place
him: and that place shall he afterward keep. Yet you must know, most noble
prince, that this Justice shall the^ among other things swear, that he shall
indifferently minister justice to all men as well foes as friends, that shall
have any suit or plea before hi^ And this shall he not forbear to do though
the king by his letters, or by express word of mouth would command the
contrary. He shall also swear that from that time forward he shall not
receive or take any fee or pension, or lyuerye of any man, but of ye king only
nor any gift, reward or brybe of any man having suit or plea before him,
saving meat and dri^ke. which shall be of no great value. You shall also know
that a Justice thus made shall not be at the charges of any diner, or
solempnitie, or any other costs at the ti^e when he takes upon him his
office and dignity, for so much as this is no degree in ye faculty of the law,
but an office only and a rowm of authority to continue duringe the kings
pleasur Howebeit the habit of his raime^t he shall from time to time forward in
some points change, but not in all the ensignements thereof. For bei^ge a
seriau^t at law he was clothed in a long robe priestlyke, with a furred cape
about his should^rs, and thereupon a hoode with ii. labels such as doctors of
the laws use to wear in certain universities, with the above discribed quoife
But being ones made a Justice, i^ stead of his hood he shall wear a cloak
closed upon his right shoulder, all ye other ornaments of a seriaunt still
remaining: saui^ge that a Justice shall wear no party colored vesture as a
seriaunt may. And his cape is furred with none other then meneuer, whereas the
seriauntes cape is ever furred with white la^be. And this habit I would wish
your grace to bring into hieghe estimation, when it shall be i^ your power, for
the worship of the state of the law, and ye honor of your royalme
Furthermore I would ye should know that the Justices of England sit not in
the kings courts above iii. hours in a day, that is to say, from viii. of
the clock in ye forenone till xi. complete, For in ye afternones those courts
are not holden or kept. But the Suitors then resort to ye perusing of their
writings and elsewhere consulting with the Seriauntes at law and other their
counsailoures Wherefore the Justices after they have taken their refection, do
pass and bestow all the residue of the day in the study of the laws, in
reading of holy scripture, and using other kind of contemplacion at their
pleasure. So that their life may seem more contemplative then active. And
thus do they lead a quiet life discharged of al wordly cares and troubles.
And it has never been known that any of them has been corrupt with gifts
or brybes. whereupon we have seen this kind of grace following, that skante
any of them dyethe without issue, which unto just me^ is a token of the great
and peculiar blessing of god And in mine opinion it is to be judged for no
small point of the bountefull goodness of god, that out of the generation of
Judges there have hitherto spronge up mo states and pears of the royalme the^
out of any other state of me^: which by their own wit and policy have
aspired unto great wealth, nobility, and honor Yea though the state of
merchauntes surmount the number of Iudgeis by many thousans being men of such
singular wealth that among them comme^ly there be such, as one of the^ in
riches passes all the Iusticeis of ye royalm For this cannot be ascribed unto
fortune, which is nothing. But it is to be attributed (as I take it) only to
the blessing of god. For somuche as by his prophet he says yt the
generation of righteous men shall be blessed And the prophet in an other place
speaki^g of just men, says yt their children shall be in blessing. wherefore
o most magnifice^t prince be you in love with justice, which thus e^richeth,
exalts to honor and auaunceth to perpetuite the children of them that have
her in veneration. And be you a zealous lover of the law, the very welspri^ge
of Justice, yt by you it may be said yt is written of ye righteous And their
seed shall remain for ever.

The prince finds fault with delays that are made in the kings courts.
Cap. 52.
THere remains now but one thing good Chancellor, quod the prince to be
declared, wherewith my mind so^ewhat yet wauereth and is disquieted, wheri^ if
you stay and satisfy me, I will trowble you with no mo questions. The laws of
England, as the report goes suffer great delaes in their processes, more then
the laws of other nations. which unto suitors is not only a hinderaunce of
their right, but also many times an importable burden of charges, and chiefly
in those actions, wheri^ damages are not allowed

Princeps. Vnum ia^ solum super est Ca^cellarie declara^dum: quo parumper adhuc
fluctuat, inq^etat' quoque men's mea. In quo si ea^ solidaueris, no^ a^plius te
q^stionibus fatigabo. Dilationes ingentes, vt asseritur, patiuntur leges
Angliae in processibus suis plusqua^ leges aliaru^ nationum, quoth pete^tibus,
nedu^ iuris sui progatio e^, sed et sumptuum qua^doquidem importabile onus, et
maxim in actionibus illis in quibus damna pete^tibus no^ redduntur.

Delays that happen in the kings courts are neacessarie and reasonable. Ca.
53.
IN actions personal, quod the Chau^cellour, out of Cities and towns of
merchandise where the manner of proceedynge is acordynge to the customz and
liberties of the same there the procedinges are ordinary. And though they
suffer great delays, yet they be not excessive. But in the same Cities and
towns, chiefeli when any urgent cause so requires, there is quick dispatche
made, like as in other parts of the world and yet not with such hot have as in
some other places, that the pertye be there by endammaged. Agai^e in accions
real the procedynges are very slow almost, in all parts of the world. For
within the royalme of France in ye hieghest court there, which is called the
court of parliament, there be certei^ processes yt have hanged there above xxx.
years. And I know that a cause of appeal, which in that court between
Richard Hero^ an English merchaunt and other merchaunt me^ for a trasgression
made has been debated within the jurisdiction of that court, has already
hanged by ye space of x. years. And it is not yet like that it can be decided
within other x. yeares^* while I was lately abiding i^ Paris mine host showed
me his process in writynge, which in the court of parliament there he had the^
followed full viii. years for iiii.s. re^te, which i^ our monei makes not
above viii.d. and yet he was i^ no hope to obtain judgment in.viii. years
more. And I know other cases there like unto these So that the laws of
England, as seems to me, cause not so great delays as do ye laws of that
country. But to speak vpprightly, it is necessary that delays be had in the
processes of all actions so that the same be not to much excessive. For by
reason thereof the parties and chiefly the party defe^dant, do often times
provide themselfes of good defenses and also of counsels, which else yey should
lack. And in judgments there is never so great danger toward as when
process goes foreward with over much haste. For I saw ones in the City of
Salisburi before a certain judge at a jail delyuerie there with the clerk of
the assyfes, a woman attai^ted and burned for the death of her husband within a
year after he was slain. In the which case it was in the judges power to have
reprieued or respected that womans arraygnement til the end of that year. And
about a year after that I saw one of ye servants of the slain man co^uict
before ye same Justice of the death of the same his master. Who then openly
confessed, yt he himself alone slew his master, and that his maistres his wife
which before was burned, was altogether innocent of his death. And he for ye
same was drawn and hanged And still even at ye point of death he lamented the
woman burned, as one clear from that offense. O what perplexity and remorse
of c^nscience it is to be thought that this so hasty a Justice had of this
deed which might justly have stayed the process? He himself (alas) often
confessed unto me that he should never during his life be hable to clear his
conscience of this fact. For many times in deliberatio^s, judgments grow to
riepenes, but in over hasty process never. Wherefore the laws of England admit
essoyne, and so do noe other laws of al ye world Are not vouchinges to warrant
right profitable Are not the aids of them profitable, to whom the reuersion of
tenementes brought in plea belongethe, and which have the evidences of the
same.

Are not also the aids of coperteners profitable which shall pay according
to the rate of a tenemente allotted to their copertener by force of the law
euicted from him. And yet al these are delays as you most noble prince by my
talk at other times do well know. And the like delays to these do no other
laws admit. Neither do the laws of England admyt tryeflinge and unfruitful
delays. And if any such fond delays should be used they may at every
parliament be cut away Yea and other laws used in the same royalme, when in
any point theye beegynnne to haste theye may at every parliament be
reformed. Wherefore it may well be concluded, that all the laws of that
royalme are right good either in deed, or in possibility. So that if they
be not presentlye good, theye may easlye be reduced to the present perfection
of goodness. To the perfourmaunce whereof as often as equytye so requyrethe,
every king there is bound by an oath solempnelye taken at the time of his
coronation.

The laws of England are right good, the knowledge whereof is expedient for
kings. Yet it shall suffice the^ to have but a superficial knowledge of the
same Cap. 54.
I Have well and evidently perceived, quod ye prince, by ye process of your
talk good Chau^cellour, yt those lawz are not only good, but also of most
perfect and excellent goodness. And if any of the^ have need to be amended
that may quicklye be done as the fourmes and orders of ye parliamentes there
do plainlye prove Wherefore ye roialme is ever really or potentiallye governed
by most excellent and most worthy laws. And I doubt not but that your
instructions in this our talk shall be profitable for the kings of England
which hereafter shall be: so that they have noe pleasure in gouernynge by
unpleasant laws. For the vnhandsomnes of the tool or instrumente werieth the
workmanne: and a blunte pike or a dulle sweorde makethe a cowardelye soldier
But like as a soldier is encouraged to fight not only when he has
handsome and fit weapons in a readynes, but also much more when he is expert
and skillful in warlike acts, according to the saying of Vegetius in his book
of chivalry, ye knowledge and connyng in martial feats ministers boldenes in
fightinge (for no man fears to do that which he trusts he has well
learned) in like manner every king has a fervent zeal, and earnest desire to
ye maintenance of Justice, not only knowi^g ye laws, whereby ye must be don,
to be most just, but also being skilful in the form and nature of ye same.
Whereof it shall suffice ye prince to have only an universal, a superficial,
and a confuse knoweledge, the discreet and determinate perfectnes, and deep
under sta^dinge of the same being left to his judges. So also ought all
princes to be well seen in the holy scriptures of god, as sayethe vincentius
Beluacensis in his book of the moral institution of princes Forasmuch as the
scripture above mentioned sayethe that vain are all theye in whom is not the
knowledge of god and for that in the sixteen the chapter of the proverbs it is
thus written. Let prophecye or the word of god be in the lyppes of the king,
and then his mouth shall not go wrong in judgment. And yet is not a king
bound to have profounde knowledge, and determinate understanding in ye holy
scriptures, as it becommethe a professoure of dyuinitye. For it shall be enough
for hi^ superficially to taste ye sentences thereof, as also of his laws. Thus
did Charles the great, Jews his son, and Robert sometime king of France
who wrote this sequence.

Sancti spiritus adsit nobis gratia: and diverse other princes, as the foresaid
Vince^cius in the fiftenethe chapter of his book aforesaid plainly shewethe.
Wherefore ye doctors of ye laws do say, yt an e^perour bears al his laws in
ye box of his breast: not for yt he knows all ye laws reallye and in deed,
but for that he understands the principles of the^, likewise their form,
and their nature: in which respect he is judged to be skillful in all his
laws. Which also he may alter, change, and repeal. So that in him are
potentiallye all his laws, as Eve was in Adam before she was made. Butte now,
good Chancellor seeing I perceive mye self sufficientlye persuaded to the
study of the laws of England, which thing in ye beginning of this work you
promised to perform, I will no longer trouble you in this behalf. But thus I
insta^tly desire you, yt ye will i^struct me in ye pri^ciples of ye law as you
once began to do And that you will teach me to know and understand the
fourm and nature thereof. For this law shall be evermore peculiar to me
among al other laws of the world, among the which I see it shiene as
lucifer among the stars. And for so much as I doubt not, but your intent,
whereby you were moved to this conference is fully satisfiyd: both time and
reason requirethe, that we make an end of our talk, yeeldynge therefore lauds
and thanks to him, which began, furthered, and has fynished the same.
Whom we call Alpha et O, who also be praised of every lyuinge creature. Amen.

PRi^ceps. Leges illas nedu^ bonas sed et optimas esse ca^cellarie, ex
prosecutio^e tua in hoc dialogo certissime dep^he^di. Et si q^ ex eis meliorari
deposcant, id citissime fieri posse, parliamentoru^ ibi them formulae nos
erudiunt. Quo realiter pote^tialiterue, regnum illud semper prestantissimis
legibus gubernatur, nec tuas in hac concionatione doctrinas futuris Angliae
regibus inutiles fore conijtio, du^ no^ dilectet regere legibus quae non
delectant. Fastidet namque artificem ineptio instrumenti, et militem ignauum
reddit debilitas la^ciae et mucronis. Sed sicut ad pugna^ animatur miles cu^
nedu^ sibi pronasi^t arma, sed et magis cu^ in actibus bellicis ip^e sit
expertus, dicente Vegetio de re militari: qd' sciencia rei bellicae dimicandi
audaciam nutrit, Quia nemo facere metuit quod se been di dicisse confidit. Sic
et rex omnis ad iustitiam animatur dum leges quibus ipsa fiet, nedum
iustissimas esse agnoscit, sed et earum ille expertus sit formam et naturam,
quas tantum in universally, inclusiue, et inco^fuso principi scire sufficient,
remanen te suis iudicibus, earum discreta determinataque peritia et scientia
altiori. Sic equide^ et scripturarum diuinaru^ peritiam, vt dicit Vincentius
Beluacensis in libro de morali institutio^e pri^cipum: Omnis princeps habere
deberet cum dicat scriptura superius memorata: qd' vanae sunt oe^s in quibus
no^ est scientia dei, et prouerbi.xvi. scribatur: Diuinatio, id est diuina
se^tentia vel sermo diuinus, sit in labiis regis: et tunc in iuditio non
errabit os eius. Non tamen profunde, determinateue intelligere tenetur Pri^ceps
scripturas sacras, vt decet sacrae theologiae professor sufficit na^que ei
earu^ in co^fuso degusta re sententias, qualiter et peritia^ legis suae. Sic et
fece^u^t Carolus Mag^us, Lodouicus filius eius, et Robertus quo^da^ rex
Fra^ciae, qui hanc scripsit seq^ntia^: Sa^cti spiritus ad sit nobis gratia, et
qua^ plures alij, vt i^.xv. ca. lib. p^dicti Vincentius p^dictus luculenter
docet. Vnde et doctores legu^ dicu^t: qd' imperator gerit oi^a iura sua in
scrinio pectoris sui, no^ q^a o^i^a iura ip^e noscit realiter et in actu sed
du^ pri^cipia eoru^ ip^e percepit, forma^ similiter et natural, oi^a iura sua
ipse i^telliger' ce^setur q^ etia^ tra^sformare ille potest, mutare et cassare
quo i^ eo pote^tialiter su^t o^nia iura sua, vt in Ada^ erat Eua antequa^
plasmaretur Sed quia Ca^cellarie, ad legu^ Angliae disciplinatu^ mihi ia^
conspicio suffici enter esse suasum, quod et in huius operis exordio facere
promisisti: No^ te a^plius huius p^textu, solicitare conabor, sed obnixe de
posco, vt in legis huius principijs, vt quo^dam incepisti, me erudias: doce^s
quodamodo eius agnoscere forma^ et naturam, quia lex ista mihi semper
peculiaris erit i^ter ceteras leges orbis, inter quas ipsa^ lucere co^spicio,
vt lucifer inter stellas. Et du^ intentioni tuae qua ad collatione^ hanc
concitatus es, ia^ satisfactu^ esse no^ a^bigo, tempus postulat et ratio, vt
nostris colloquiis terminu^ co^feramus: redde^tes ex eis lauds ei et gratias
qui ea incepit, prosecutus est et finiuit, Alpha et O que^ dicimus, que^ et
laudet o^nis spiritus Amen.

The table.
AN Introduction to the matter. Fo. 3. The Chanceller moves the Prince to the
knowledge of the law. Fo. 4. The Princes reply to ye motion. 7 The
Chau^cellour fortifieth his assertion. 8 The Chancellor proves that a Prince
by the law may be made happy and blessed. 10 Ignorance of the law causes
contempt thereof. 14 The Chancellor briefly repeteth the effect of his
persuasion. 17 The Prince yeldoth him self to the study of the laws, though
he be yet disquieted with certain doubts. 19 So much knowledge as is
necessary for a prince is soon had. 20 A king whose government is politic
cannot change his laws. 25 The Prince demands a question. 27 The answer
is omitted, for that in an other work it is handled at large. 28 How
kingdoms ruled by roya^^ ^ouernement only, first began. 28 How kingedo^es
of politic governance were first begone. 30 The Prince compend^^^sly
abridgeth all that the Chancellor before has discoursed at large. 33 All
laws are the law of Nature, custo^s, or statutes. 36 The law of Nature in
all Countries is one. 37 The customs of England are of most ancient
antiquity practiced and received of v. several Nations from one to another by
success. 38 With what gravity statutes are made in England. 39 A mean to
know the diversity between the Civil laws and the laws of England. 41 The
first case wherein the Civil laws and the laws of England differ. 42
Inconuenie^ces that comes of that law, which, no otherwise the^ by witnesses
admits trials. 43 Of the cruelty of Rackinges. 46 The Civil law often
failethe in doing of justice. 50 How counties are divided and Sherifes
chosen. 51 How Iurers (...) chosen and sworn. 54 How Iurers (...) to be
informed by euydences and witnesses. 57 How causes criminal are determined in
England. 61 The Prince grants the laws of England to be more commodious for
the subjects then ye Civil laws in the case disputed. 63 Why Inquestes are
not made by Iuries of.xii. men. in other realms as well as in England. 65 The
Prince commends the laws of England of their proceeding by Iuries. 69 The
Prince doubts whether this proceeding by Iuries be repugnant to Gods law or
not. 70 That the proceeding by a Jury (...) not repugnant to the law of God.
72 Why certain kings of England have had no delyghte in their own laws. 76
The Chaunceller opens the cause which the Prince demands. 77 The
commodities that proceed of ye joint government politic and regal in the
realm of England. 83 A comparison of ye worthiness of both the regiments. 86 The
prince breaks the ^^^uncellour of his tale. 89 The second case wherein the
Civil laws and the laws of England disagree in theirs judgments. 89
Special causes why base borne children are not legittimate in England by
matrimonye ensuynge. 93 The prince allows the law which does not legittimate
children borne before matrymonye. 98 The third case wherein the laws
aforesaid disagree. 98 The prince approuethe the law whereby ye issue
follows the womb. 102 The fowerthe case wherein ye said laws varye. 104 The
prince commendethe the education of noble men's children being orphans. 106
Other cases wherein the foresaid laws differ. 108 The prince regardethe not a
case rehearsed. 109 The Chaunceller shows why the laws of England are not
taught in the universities. 110 The disposition (...) general study of the
laws of England (...) that the same in number passes certain universities.
113 Of the state and degree of a seriea^t at law and how he is created. 116
After what manner a Justice is created, and of his habit and conversation. 121
The prince fyndethe fault with delays that are made in the kings court. 125
That delays which happen in the kings courts are necessary and reasonable.
126 That the laws of England are right good, the knoweledge thereof
expediente for kings, and that it shall suffice them to have but a superficial
knowledge of the same. 129
