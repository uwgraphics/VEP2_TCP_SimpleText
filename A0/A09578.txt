A BRIEF AND SHORT INSTRVCTION OF THE ART OF MUSIC, to teach how to make
Discant, of all proportions that are in use:

VERY NECESSARY FOR ALL such as are desirous to attain to knowledge in the Art;

And may by practice, if they can sing, soon be able to compose three, four,
and five parts: And also to compose all sorts of Canons that are usual, by
these directions of two or three parts in one, upon the Plain-song.

LONDON, Printed by R. Young, at the sign of the Star on Bread-street hill.
1631.

TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, AND MY Honorable good Lord, the Lord
Bishop of GLOUCESTER.
RIGHT REVEREND,
AFter much pains taken in the study and art of Music, for these many years
last past, to compose Canons of two and three parts in one upon the Plain-song;
have now at length laid down this burden of my mind, the hopeful issue of my
tired brain. To the visiting of which Infant, many of my good friends
resorting, and those skillful in my profession, persuaded me to expose it to
the world, and let try for it self; which I refused to do, until I called to
mind, that it might tend to the praise and glory of Almighty God, and to the
benefit of my native country: Yet finding, that such exposed Infants might
easily perish without the protection of some worthy and powerful Patron,
resolved to keep it at home, until I remembered your good Lordship to be a
lover and favourer of Music, and unto whom I have been much bound for many
favors, for all which, being not able to return worthy compensation, but
rather to trench more and more daily upon your benignity, do bequeath this my
Infant unto your Lordships Patronage, whom I know for authority, wisdom, and
learning to be able, and for piety and charity will be willing, to protect the
same; which if you vouchsafe, you have and always shall have devoted

To your Lordships service, ELVVAY BEVIN.

TO THE READER.
BEing no less true than ancient, that good things common are of more regard,
I might not imbrest this talent (the perfection of my long endeavors) and not
impart it to the public benefit, lest I should prove my self no Moralist,
and so incur their blackest censure, who first did back me on this
enterprise. I doubt not the perusers favor (yet not glory in my little one) if
he vouch safe it but a slender trial; for though it be but small in quantity,
yet for diversities of examples and difficulties, the quality may seem the
greater, and pass the elaborate works of larger volumes. Thine,

Elway Bevin.

To Mr Elway Bevin upon his Canons of three parts in one* An EPIGRAM.
Music breaths heaven, nay more, it does disclose it,
If old Judicious Bevin do compose it.
Astronomy stares high, and does not fear
To draw heavens curtain, and unfold a Sphere:
But Music climbes as high as Jacobs Scale,
Out-vies a Jacobs Staff: it does unvaile
Three for her one, or rather three in one:
A mystery that Art never thought upon.
Three parts in one, are no Trichotomy
Of one in three, but a sweet Trinity
Combined in one. This may (with wonder) make
An Atheist (if he will lay his ears to stake)
Sing Trinity in Unity, when he shall
Hear that (which he thought harsh) prove musical.
Church Music finds applause, then why not He
That sets forth Canons of a Trinity?
Thomas Palmer. Bristoll.

There are nine Concords of Music, as follows:
A Unison, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eight, Tenth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fifteenth:
Whereof five are called perfect, and four unperfect.

The five perfect, are, Unison, Fifth, Eight, Twelfth and Fifteenth: Of these
you may not take two of one sort together, neither rising nor falling, as two
Fifts or two Eights.

The other four, called unperfect, you may take two or three together of one
sort, rising or falling, which are, a Third, Sixth, Tenth, and Thirteenth.

These nine Concords are comprehended in four, viz.
Unison, Eight, Fifteenth, are counted as one, for every eight is the same. So
that in effect there are but four Concords.
Third, Tenth, likewise. Fifth, Twelfth, likewise. Sixth, Thirteenth, in like
sort.

The Discords are, a Second, Fourth, and Seventh, with their Eights; which
being sometime mixed with Concords, make best music, being orderly taken.

The proportions, as follow.

The point reuerted. ^ ^ ^

The ordinary ways of two parts in one, are as follows.

2. in one in the
Unison. Second. Third. Fourth. Fifth. Sixth. Seventh.
Of these sorts you may make upon one Plain-song a thousand ways, only by
altering the Rests, and setting the Plain-song sometime above, sometime below,
and sometime in the midst, which causes great variety, as for example you
may partly see, by these that follow.

Plain-song above. A Crochet following. ^ ^

Thus may you increase your Rests, if the Plain-song be of any length, to eight
or ten Semibriefes, or more, before the following part comes in. And in this
order might a great number of ways be made: But I will not counsel any to
the pursuit thereof; for I hold it better to know the way and means how it may
be done, than to take so laborious a work in hand.

Two parts to the Plainsong maintaining their several points. ^ ^ ^

Another example of the same. ^ ^ ^

There are diverse other ways of two parts in one, which are not so common,
but yet more difficult in composing, as two in one per Augmentation, that is,
when one part doubleth every Note, making the Crochet a Mynome, the Mynome a
Semibriefe, etc.

Example. ^ ^

Canon per Aug. ^

Another example. ^

Canon per Aug. ^ ^

Also you have two parts in one per Arsin and Thesin, by contrary motions, that
when one part ascends the other descends, which is both difficult, and
carries more majesty than any other Canon: And are diversely made in any
distance.

Example.

Canon per Arsin and Thesin. ^ ^ ^

Another example. ^

Canon per Arsin and Thesin. ^ ^

Moreover you have two in one Recte and Retro, when one part sings forward
and the other backward, which is somewhat difficult to be made upon a
Plainsong, but without, the easiest of all other. Many other ways there are,
and are daily invented by the skillful, as you shall perceive by these examples
that follow.

There is also a kind of double discant which is no Canon, but somewhat of the
nature of a Canon, and sometime also made in a Canon.

Double discant.

The Principal. ^ ^ ^

In the Reply the Treble is set eight notes lower and made the Counter, and the
Base is set twelve notes higher and made the Treble, the Plainsong set an eight
lower and made the Base.

The reply. ^ ^ ^

Double discant in a Canon. ^

The principal. ^ ^

In the Reply the higher of the principal is set an eight lower and made the
Base, and the Base set a fifth higher and made the Counter, and the Plainsong
being the Treble set eight notes lower.

The Reply. ^ ^ ^

Diminution by turns per Arsin and Thesin. ^ ^ ^

Here are certain Canons of three in one, very difficult, made of the
Plainsong it self; every part contrary to other in nature. These are compound
Canons, even as the Apothecary makes his confections of diverse simples,
compounded together of sundry ways.

conceive of every particular, being also set down in partition.

This Canon rises a note at every return, and rises note by note to the end.

Canon three in one, Diapente inferior, making every note a Semibriefe. ^ ^ ^

Two parts falling, the third rising, making every note a Semibriefe.

Canon three in one. ^ ^ ^ ^

The third part sings only the Mynomes making them Semibriefes, per Aug.

Canon three in one Unison. ^ ^ ^ ^

A Canon of three in one, has resemblance to the holy Trinity, for as they are
three distinct persons and but one God, so are the other three distinct parts,
comprehended in one. The leading part has reference to the Father, the
following part to the Son, the third to the holy Ghost.

Five Voc. This Canon is to be prict in two several colors.

Canon three in one. ^ ^

The red is one part, the black another, the third part sings both colors,
leaving all the Rests, as appears below.

The Canon explained. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

Here follow certain Canons, which are most difficult in composition, by
reason of the great variety of Canons contained in them.

This Canon has a resemblance to the frame of this world, for as this world
does consist of the four Elements, viz. Fire, Air, Water, and the Earth, and
in either of them sundry living and moveable creatures: So likewise this Canon
consists and is divided into four several Canons, and to every one
belongs fifteen parts, a certain number for an uncertain.

The whole sixty parts are contained in these seven. These figures are set to
distinguish the parts.

1 3 5 7^

2 4 6^

1 2 3 4 5 6 7^

1 3 5 7^

2 4 6^

Here is to be noted, that the following parts of every Canon rest two
Semibriefes after other, every Canon different in nature. ^ ^ ^

You shall understand that in the Canon, which is the red, is divided into
four several Canons, and to every of them belongs fifteen parts, in the
whole three score: Two of these Canons are whole, and two are half Canons,
because they take only the later part, which is the Semibriefe and Semibriefe
Rest, and are to be sung in diverse tunes according to the direction.

Bis binos capit Canon verosque Canones:
Integri duo sunt, dimidiique duo.
Horum quisque Canon vero terquinque requirit:
At primo debent caetera cuncta Cani.
Sed iuncto duplici Basso ponitur infra,
Vocibus isto nouem singularite Canas.

These threescore parts in one are contained in four red notes.

This Canon is to be sung in all distances, as appears in the page following.

Four Voc. ^

Canon Unison. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

He that will look into the depth of this Canon, must take the pains to
prick out every one of these at large, for I have set down only the beginning
of every part, to save labor: And so likewise in the next that follows.

The Plainsong never changes, neither the Base, but only in the fifth way,
which is the Canon set eight notes lower.

The other two parts may easily be prict according to the directions set down
already.

Three parts to the Plain-song, composed in such sort, as every part is made
the Base or ground to the other, which causes variety of music, by reason of
the changing of the parts and is to be sung four several ways, as appears.

Four Voc: ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

Either of these Replies are to be prict out at large.

The first Reply. The second Reply. The third Reply. ^

1 The Treble in the first Reply, is the Tenor of the principal, prict an
eight higher. 2 The Treble in the second Reply, is the Mean of the principal,
prict a fifth higher. 3 The Treble in the third Reply, is the Base of the
principal, set twelve notes higher.
^

1 The Mean in the first Reply, is the Treble of the principal. 2 The Mean
in the second Reply, is the Base of the principal, set twelve notes higher. 3
The Mean in the third Reply, is the Tenor of the principal, set eight notes
higher.
^

1 The Tenor in the first Reply, is the Base of the principal, set eight notes
higher. 2 The Tenor in the second Reply, is the Treble of the principal, set
eight notes lower. 3 The Tenor in the third Reply, is the Mean of the
principal, set four notes lower.
^

1 The Base in the first Reply, is the Mean of the principal, set eight notes
lower. 2 The Base in the second Reply, is the Tenor of the principal. 3 The
Base in the third Reply, is the Treble, set fifteen notes lower.
xxi. parts. Four parts to the plain-song, every part five in one, resting
five Semibriefes after other.

Canon five in one. ^

Whose will take a view of all the parts of this song, must take the pain to
prick out every part by it self. The first rests five Semibriefes, the
second ten, the third fifteen, the fourth and last twenty: and so likewise
every Canon.

The Closes that are set here, serve to show where every part ends: The part
that rests fine Semibriefes, ends on the last Close save one, that part
that rests ten Semibriefes, ends on the last Close, save two. So the rest
accordingly.

Five parts in one to the plain-song, resting five Semibriefes after other, in
a Round.

Six Voc. Thrice over. ^

Fifteen parts in one, loc here may you see,
Upon the Plain-song, all contained in three.
And to this intent, In five notes consist,
That may represent the five wounds of Christ.

Sing this five times over. This last note that stands by it self, is for
the final Close of the first part. ^

Laus Deo.

Thus much have J thought sufficient for young Practitioners at this present,
but if I may perceive any to take profit herein, shall be encouraged hereafter
to set out a larger Volume, is it please God to give me life, and enable me
thereunto. In the mean season, I wish thee all happiness and good success in
thy proceedings. Thy hearty wel-willer in Christ Jesus, Elway Bevin*
