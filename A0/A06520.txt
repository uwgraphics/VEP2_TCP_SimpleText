Unto the right honorable and his most synguler good lord / my lord
wentworthe. Rychard Argentyne wyssheth increase of honor peace and prosperous
succes / in all his procedinges.
ALbeit (right honorable) that the prophecye of Jacob was true / that the
scripture was not taken a way from Judah / unto the time that Silo came / the
very true Messiah / both God and man. Yet did the almygtye GOD punish the Jews
with blyndnes / chefelye / for their Hipocrisye and Idolatrye / ande spoiled
them of the most holy and right gouuernaunce. Where therefore it might appear /
that Antechrist was most justly and laufullye extirped all together with his
usurped power out of this most fortunate realm and yet the same remained in
deed still i^ the temple of god / with his abhominacio^ under the cloak of
i^numerable strange gods / which by his persuasio^s were decked ith pardons,
teples gold / silver / precious stones and other costly things / to stir
there by the people / both to be servants unto them / and to honor them /
whereby (Christ being clean exti^guisshed) myserably we have justified the
Idolatrye of the Jews / that of just cause the Turk (as the scourge of God)
does therefore hate and persecute Christen men.

It has pleased almighty god of his great mercy / to send unto us a Josias /
and a King of most worthy fame / clean to weed out the same / commaundyng
god and his holy word frelie to be given unto all his louinge subjects /
and Christ only truly ande syncerelye to be taught ande read every where /
the which is the very true keye / whereby to enter into the Kingdom of heaven /
ande the next way / to obtain the mighty ande strong swearde / for ever to
beat down the deuell and his dearly beloved antechriste. For those truly /
did not receive / with the Apostles / at the hands of the holighoost / the
authority of the keys of heaven / that teach their own tradicions / ande
not Christ only / and the infinite mercy of God / And yet so much has been
the craking of the feigned virtues of the abouenamed ennemy of God. His painted
keys have been so much exalted / his colored lyghtning / is so much dredde
in foreign Realms (the more pity) even at this day / that there by he
makes him self not only the vicare of god upon earth / but also a
shameful myxed thing / set and boasted unto the woorlde / as a certain God
of the earth / being both dradde ande honored even above God him self / and
is in deed but a man of sin / and the son of perdition. To the intent
therefore / that thauctorite of his keys / may the better be known / I have
translated a sermon / declaring the true use of the keys of absolution / whom
the bisshoppe of Rome has shamefully abused. Geuinge that for a token of my
heart / unto your good lordeshippe / that other by you (if your pleasure so
shall be) may have the fruytion of so great a comfort / to the maintenance of
holy learning. That the interest of his deceptfull iugglinge may utterly be
bannyshed for ever. Ande thus Jesus preserve your lordeshippes estate unto gods
honor. Fare you well.

depiction of the biblical verses, John 20.21-23 Johan. xx. Peace be with you.
Like as my father sent me / even so send I you. And when he had said that /
he breathed upon the^ / and said unto them. Receive the holy ghoost / whose
sins soever ye remytte they are remitted unto them and whose sins soever ye
retain / they are retained.


Receave the holy gh^. Gospel.



THE lord teaches by the words of this Gospel / what proffyt he has done
unto us / by his resurrextion / that is to vnder^ande / that by that he has
erected and instituted a kingdom / in the which it is intreaced / not of gold
or silver / nor of other things that are necessary to pass over this our
life / or by what craft or ways those things may be invented / or by what
reason / soche being gotten may be preserved. Truly this Kingdom which does
consist in these earthely ande corporal things / was institute now before
strayghtwayes in the beginning of the world / ande being from that time
establisshed / it takes force and endures / ande is subject by the word of
God unto man's reason ande prudence / Genesis the first chapter / where God
says thus. Gene. 1. The earthely kingdom.
Be ye lords upon the fysshes of the sea / and the birds of the air / and
upon all things having life that moves upon the earth. etc.

This is the old kingdom in the ministracio^ whereof / the seculer magistrate
is occupied / neither is there any need of the holighoost for the mynistration
of this kingdom / neither do the holy scriptures chefely entreat of this / to
teach by what reasonnes that may be gouuerned.

But it apperteineth unto the office of soche as are learned in the law / to
teach and counsel what is the reason of the ministration of this kingdom.

But besides this earthely kingdom / there is also an other / that is to say /
the kingdom of consciences / and a spiritual kingdom / the which does
gouuerne co^scyences / and in the which it is entreated of these busynesses
that are betwixt us ande God. The spiritual kingdom is of ijsortes.
Truly this Kingdom is of two sorts. The one was instituted by Moses / the
other is erected and instituted here by Christ. Where he says. Like as my
father has sent me / so do I send you etc.

The use of Moses kingdom is this / to teach us what sin is / and which are
truly good woorks and which are evil. Into this kingdom must those be sent /
which truly as yet do not know their si^nes / nor feale them. Of the which
sort those are / which are against the law / the which do teach that the law
is not to be preached. Those that are soch as feel not the hardness of the law
of Moses / ande the wayght of the same / they can not esteem as it is worthy /
the grace of the gospel / or the benefit of Christ / or with glad heart to
embrace the same / or to desire it from the botome of their heart. Wherefore
thou shall in vain teach among those much of the grace that is gotten by
Christ / for where the law is not taught / ande well beaten into them / there
do me^ know nothing of sin / what thing it is / how great the crudelitie
and abomination of it is / and which are the true ande most grievous sins /
as. S. Paul does witness / saying. Wherefore the law was given.
Without law / sin is dead. Also where the law is not / there is no
transgression. For how great a thing sin is / and also / how great the
wrath of God is against sin / it can not be known but by the law. Wherefore
/ where the law is not pricked forth / nor diligently and instauntly beaten in
to them / there plainly men are Ethnikes and Profane parso^s / thinking the^
selves to do well / yea / and excellently to do the thing / when they do
abhominably sin against the precepts of God.

The wordly power does restrain and punish / those manifest and gross
mischeuous acts ande sins / but what sin is before God / it can neither
declare nor teach / although she should take to counsel all the heaps of the
books parteininge to the law. Therefore was the law given unto us / that we
thereby might learn to know what sin is / for where sin is not known
there is no remyssion / ande grace can not be understand / much less desired
and coueted / and more over than is there no use of grace / for grace ought to
fight against sin and to vanquish it in us that we despair not.

Wherefore like as it is necessary for a physician (that will with praise
profess his art / and be like unto his name and calling) to have the use of
long experience / and to be exercised much and long time in that science that
he may know and search out / first what / and what kind of desease it is
and also what are the causes thereof. For if he shall endeavor to remedy the
sickness (the disease not being known / nor the causes of the same found out)
he shall rather give a poison / then the remedy or help of the same. Even so
is it necessary first sin to be known before that grace be preached. And
for the know leadge of si^ne / the law is needful. Wherefore the first
instruction of a christen man is diligently to be taught / ande the ten
commandments are to be interpreted well / and beaten into the people and
that is necessary to be done in sermons in the temples. For reason (as I have
said) is a great deal to weak / and to full of imbecilitie / with all her
wisdom / ande with all ^e ^awes and precepts of all the learn^ men of the
law / to parfourme that. And albeit that we grant / that chefelie in reason
is p^a^ced and graffed a certain knowleadge of the thing chat is honest and
dishonest / yet is that so small and thin^e / that it can not sufficiently
know the malice and noughtines of her nature and the greatness of sin. And
therefore god has instituted by Moses / this doctrine ande preaching of the
law / the which he had ceyued before of the fathers.

The other kingdom is that which the resurrection of our lord Jesus christ
has made. For by his resurrection he would begin ande erecte a new kingdom
the which should resist sin (when by the law they are known) death and hell
/ and does restrain the^ / take them a way and abolish the^ / neither does
this ki^gdo^ teach us how matrimonies may be co^tracted / how the prouisyon
of the house at home and of the public weal / ande Empyres are to be
gouuerned ande ministered. How peace ande concord upon the earth and the
societe of men is to be preserved. How we must build / sow / plant / and
till our lands, etc. Of this (I say) this other kingdom teaches nothing.
But it is therefore erected / that we may know where we must dwell / or
whether we must go from hence / that we may live perpetuallye / when this
corruptible and bodily kingdom will fail / and the condition of this life
shall have an end / when our goods and all our faculties / honors /
promocions / houses and lands / the woorlde and what so ever is in it / and
comes out of the earth / ande fynallye the life it self is to be forsaken.
And truly death hangs over us / and is to be looked for every momente.

If adam had not sinned / than neither death nor any other calamytie should
have been fearful unto us / neither should any danger have been unto us / by
any kind of evil. But now / through sin / death is brought into the
world / and upon all mankind. From the which no man is sure / no not for one
momente of time / for as much as every moment she hangs over man. But to
what place will thou fly? Whether will thou turn the? What mind shall thou
be in than? Whether do thou suppose to go / when present death shall take
the from hence? For this contention and for this agony is the kingdom of
Christ bought / the which for that purpose was appointed to be an everlasting
king / that he might be lord of sin and of justice / of death ande life.
With these / the kingdom of Christ has to do. Upon these he rules. He has
these in his hand.

Thus the lord means (in this place where he says. Take you the holighoost
/ whose sins so ever you shall remitte / they are retained.) to deliver men
from sin / or to declare unto them that those that dwell in sin / are to be
dampened eternally. Here truly it can not be said that a woorldly kingdom is
instituted of him (as the Pope does glory with a loudelye of the keys of power
and right to lowse and bind all things / and by that means / to make that
si^ne. which is no sin / and also that Christ him self does not bind or
lowse / and so plainly he has made by that means a worldy kingdom) But
Christ does here clearly enough teach what his keys are? The keys of
Christ's kingdom / ande what they be.
that is to say / not to fasten ande to lowse again laws / as the Pope / but
to remytte or retain sins.

The sentence therefore / and the sum of the words of Christ is. In this
shall my kingdom consist / this shall be the manner of my kingdom. F^rst that men
may know them selves to be si^ners. And truly that business is geven in
commission unto my servaunt Moses / that by his law / he may bring me^ne
into the knowledge of sin / not because I would bind them (for why? they
were bound before / ande miserably chayned) neither shall I now do first that
men may sin or geve an occasion to sin / neither will I have any thing to
do with sin (as the Pope does by his law and by his keys of bindyng /
saying / there ^o be sin where none is) but I shall have to do with them
that naturally are si^ners / or have sinned against the commandments of God
/ that is to say / soche as contemp^e God soche as beleve not in God / soch as
despise the word of God / soche as give not unto God his due obedience et
cetera.

These sins that is to say the contemp^e of God / crudelite / blasphemy /
inobedience and other like / are not made by the law of the Pope / but are very
sins / cleaving and fasted in flesh and blood / and borne even with man /
the which can not be absolved and taken away by the Pope / by the keye (as he
calls it) of remissyon and absolucio^ / after the sort as he uses it / but
they cleave still and remain in man as long as he leads this life / and he
ca^ not depose or lay the^ a part utterly but with the life

Wherefore that we may escape from these sins / for the which eternal
dampnacio^ remained unto us / and be delivered from the pain of everlastyng
death. Wath the kingdom of Chr^.
For that is the kingdom of Christ appointed and erected / and therefore every
where he calls that his kingdom / not an earthely kingdom or worldly or
pollytike / but the ki^gdome of heaven because even than it shall take the
begi^ning when this earthely ki^gdom through death shall cease to be / that men
may know how after this life / leaving this earthely kingdom / they may
come into the heavenly ki^gdome. Of this my ki^gdom (says he) this shall be the
manner / after this sort shall this my ki^gdom be erected / stablisshed / delated
and gouuerned.

As my Father has sent me / so do I also send you et cetera. That is to say.
The office of the Apostles.
You Apostles and your successors until the worlds end shall be my messangers
or Ambassadors / by whom I have purposed to reign in all the world / so
that you must take upon you the same office the which I have done / unto the
which also I was se^te. That is to say / that those may be delivered from
sin and death / which do feale their sin and death / and desire to be
delivered from them. Ande contrary / that soche as desire not the help whereby
they may be redeamed from them / but do put it away / that those beying bound
in sins to death and detained / may so remain. This shall be your kingdom /
this shall be your ministry or service / ande this shall be your office that you
shall take upon you.

Unto this kingdom it behooves all soche to submit them selves that are
pressed down and vexed with sin / if they will be delivered and lifted up from
them / and be partakers of the everlasting life. Unto those that lygh under the
heavy weight of their sins / lygh groaning / and are miserably troubled /
Christ bids us to say / that they should be of good comfort / and not
despair because of their sins / but let them know that Christ by his death
and ressurection / has brought fourth unto us / the remission of all sins.
If they hear this ande beleve it / they are saints and they are saved. For if
their si^nes be remitted / than has death no right upon them. But these that
feale not nor know their sins / nor are feared with the fear of death /
ande do not penance / but proceed constauntely / geving them selves unto
bodily lusts / as the pleasure of the flesh requires / and liui^g after the
arbitreme^t of the old man / Unto these we say by the commandment of Christ
/ you shall remain in sin / in indignation ande eternal death. For you ask
no remission of sins and mercy / ande you do frowardely put from you and
tread under foot everlastyng life.

Who (I pray the) can express with words how infinite / how substanciall
ande full of health this comfort is / that one may open unto an other with
one word the kingdom of heaven / and close up the gates of hell? For as much
as in this ki^gdom of grace (the which Christ has instituted by his
resurrection) we do no other thing tha^ that we speak with open mouth. I
remitte unto the thy sins / not of my self / or by my propre power or virtue
/ but in the name and stead of Jesus Christ. For why? he says not that you
shall remitte sins in your name (for no man living can remytte or retain
sins) but he says thus. Like as my father has sent me even so I send you.
I have not done this by my counsel or arbitrament / but for this I was sent
from my father. And this commandment I give also unto you / that you do the
same until the end of this world / that you and all the world may know
this remission or retaining of sin / not to be done by the virtue or power of
man / but by the commandment of him that has sent you.

This is not only spoken of those that are ministers and preachers of the
word of God / but of all faithful Christianes. Here may every virtuous man
/ comfort and absoile his neighbor in the agony of death / ande other
necessities ande temptacions. When thou hear of me this word / then do
thou hear that god will have mercy on the / and deliver the from death and
sin / justify the and save the.

But thou say. I have in deed hard the absolution of the / but who knows
/ whether it be certain that my sins also are forgeuen before God? I
answer. If I had said and done that / as man or of mine own or of any other
man's auctothoryte alonely / tha^ so to say and to doubt / thou might not
without cause / whether the absolutio^ given / should be hereafter effectual
and auailable before God or no. And verily I have heard many / eue^ in the
extreme agony of death / doubti^g of this thing / saying / Oh would to god I
knew certai^ly that my si^nes are forgiven unto me. I would buy the certitude
thereof with all my possiblities and goods. For albeit he be aparau^tly never
so good a ma^ne that pronou^ceth the absolutio^ / and as concerning his oune
parson / never so true / yet he that is grudged in conscience and the mind
that is careful / is not co^te^ted with him / yea if thou think hi^ to be a
man / and see in hi^ nothing else than man / than must thou needs doubt and
can nothing stick or trust unto his absolutio^ / nor any thing confyrme or
erecte thy mind by it.

But if thou be certain / and ca^ste strengthen thy mi^de against this doubt
/ tha^ is it necessary that thy mi^de (being taught and instituted by the word
of God) say after this sort. Neither the minister of the word / nor yet any
manne absolueth me from my sins / neither has my curate taught me so to
believe / but god (by this minister or faithful Christian / shewwi^g or
declari^g the remission of sins) has done it. This is more certain tha^
that / that is assured / for why? my lord Christ has commanded the same /
where he said. Like as my Father has sent me / so do I send you et cet. Here
does he make equal and match those whom he se^deth / unto him self / in
every thing / as much as concerns their Embassage or message / that they
(being sent of hi^) may do and with expedicyon perform that thing for the
which he was sent from his Father / that they may both remitte and retain
sins. This is the thing that makes that absolution to be effectual. Vithout
this commandment / Absolution should be frustrate and vain.

If therefore thou (being laden with the burden of sins) art vexed and
troubled in mind. If thou quake for fear of death / by whom God shall punish
si^nes everlasti^gly / and if thou (bei^ge in this pe^syuenes) do hear of
the minyster of the church / the curate of thy soul and thy bishop / or else
(where necessite co^pelleth / that thou can not have the minister of the
Church) of thy neighbor that proffesseth christ and comes to comfort the /
thou hear these or such like words / Dear beloved brother or sister i^
Christ / I see you careful and vexed i^ mi^d / ready to fall i^to desperatio^ /
to fear the wrath and judgment of God / because of the si^nes that thou
perceiuest / and for the which now thou art so much vexed and troubled / but
hear and straight ways conceive in mi^de / and commit the things i^to the
botom of thy heart that I shall now say unto the. There is no cause why thou
should despair / be of good comfort. For christ thy lord and savior / the
which for si^ners came i^to the world / that he might save the^ has geve^ in
commandment / both unto the ministers of the church (which for the public
ministratio^ shall be called for that purpose) and also (where necessite
compels) unto every private faithful christian / that by his words / every
man should comfort his neybor / and i^ his name absoil hi^ from si^nes.

When thou hear this comfort / see that thou receive it with so great joy
of mind / with so much gladness and kindness / as though thou hardest it of
Christ hi^ self. Christ does command sins to be remitted and also to be
retained.
So truly he has commanded / saying / As my Father has sent me / so do I
send you / Also / unto whosoever you remitt etc. That is to say / ye shall
take upon you the same office that I do. You shall execute the same
mynistratyon that I do. If therefore thou co^ceyve these words of Christ / tha^
is thy heart pacified / and co^ceyueth a substantial or sure comfort / and
than maiste thou say with a merry heart. I have heard a man that has talked
with me / and has comforted me. In as much as concerns his own propre
parson / I would not credit the least word of his saying / but I believe my
lord Christ the which has instituted this ki^gdom of grace and of remission
of sins / and has given unto me^ this power and this commandment / that in
his name they should remytt and retain sins.

Wherefore / when any vtuous man is assaulted by the deuell and with the
suggestions of Satan / that he is a great sinner and therefore lost and
conde^pned / than ought he not to desce^d i^to the place of fight with Satan /
nor to reason or to love to be solitary / or to hide himself in some secret
place without arbytrement / but let hi^ come unto some mynister of the church /
with whom he is accustomed to counsel in the business apperteini^g unto his
souls health / or let hi^ send for hi^ / or call hi^ unto him. Or if
peradventure no minister of the church be present / let hi^ call unto him / or
let hi^ resort unto his friend / whom he has known to be a lover of the
word of God and virtuous / and let him complain unto hi^ of his sins / and
of what soever difficulte does oppress him / and let him pour into his bosom
/ all things where with he is tormented and troubled in mind / requyri^g him of
his counsel / and let him trust upon the words of Christ. Unto who soever
you shall remytte their sins etc. And where two or three shall be gathered
together in my name / I shall be i^ the midst of them. Trusting upon these
words / let him assuredly believe these things that the same brother or
mynister of the church or if he be a virtuous friend / shall say i^ the name
of the Lord / out of the scryptures. Eue^ as he shall believe / so shall be done
unto him. If he give credyt unto the absolution / by the which he has absoyled
him in the name of Christ / then is he absoiled / and has remission of his
si^nes. etc.

What it is two or three to be gathered together in the name of Christ.
Than truly are two or three gathered to gether in the name of christ / when
they entreat amongst them selves / not of corporal ande earthely busynes /
how they may have great gains / how thy may gather together great riches /
by what wais and reason that may be done / or of other corporal things / of
the which this te^porall life has need / but when they e^treate among them
selves of those things which do apparteine unto the edifying ande health of the
congregation / that when in confession or else where thou do open thy vices
and temptacions / and when he with whom thou do unlade the secrets of thy
mind and thy cares / does understand and se the to be feared and stonied with
the law of Moses / by thy sins to be bitten / oppressed and vexed and
greuouslye troubled and tormented with the fear of death. And when with syghes
and unfeigned sorrows thou do lament and abhor thy life / with these and
soch like words / which proceed from those that are afearde in deed. O would to
God I had not been borne. Also / O would god / would prolo^ge my life / I would
pass it over far other wise and more holely / tha^ I have don hitherto. Like
as that servant does in the gospel / that did owe unto his lord x. m. tale^tes
sayi^g. Lord or master / be patie^t towordes me / and I shall restore unto the
all things.

When therefore the minister of the church / or who soever else shall be /
begin to comfort the / not after a wordly sort / nor for the desire of
lucre / (as the Pope does / who says / that he has power ande faculte to
lowse and bind / but at no time but when thou shall nu^bre unto him / and will
redeem his bulls / pardons and Indulgences /) but because he sees thy
careful and to be out of all comfort / through the fears of sin and
death. And therefore says unto the. Forsake and despise all / things that are
upon earth / as money / riches / all men's doings / and the life. Look not
unto those things / turn thine eyes / and all thy senses from them / but give
ear unto these things that I now say / fasten those in thy mind. Thy heart
is vexed / and thou desire nothing more than to be delivered out of sorrows
and care / ande thy conscience to be cleared / and to escape those sharp
horns of Moses that stryketh so sore. Here I say / hear what thy brother
says / whom thou take to thy counsel / when he speaks unto the / this
sentence. In the name of our lord Christ / who suffered death for the. I
declare and say unto the / that thou be of good comfort / and believe / and be
of a good and quiet mind / and doubt nothing / that thy sins are forgeuen
unto the / and that death has no right upon the.

But thou say. How will thou prove unto me that it is so in deed? I answer
/ Christ our lord said unto his disciples and unto all the catholic
congregation. I command and bid that your mytte sins / or retain them /
If you shall do any soche thing / you do it not of your selves / but when ye
do the same by my byddyng and commandment / I my self do yt. For truly / the
minister of the church that is to say / the curate of thy soul and Bishop
/ or any other who soever he be (so that he be virtuous) in this necessite / is
called ande sent therefore unto the / to comfort the. Therefore thou must as
much believe him (seeing he seeks only the health of thy soul) as though
Christ hi^ self being present / should stand by the / and laying his hands on
the / should absoile the from sin. So truly he says. I do send you that is
to say. I do communicate and give unto you full power and commandment / to
do that thing / for which I was sent from my father / and that I did. Wherefore
if any man layi^g his hands upon the / does by this commandment of Christ
declare unto the / thy remission of sins / it is as much as though Christ
hi^ self had done it / when (I say) he shall do it by the commandment of
Christ. For if that commandment of Christ were not / tha^ nothing should be
done less. And the most merciful lord forbid that I or any man should be bold
to atte^^ any soch thing without his commandment.

Behold / this is the form ande manner to remitte and absoile sins. That
thing can be done by no other reason / nor by any other means / no other
counsel / no other help is any where in any thing. For that doctrine of the
Pope / is both erroneous and blasphemous by the which me^ do profess / that by
their works and propre merits they can obtain remission of their si^nes / and
therefore does it bind me^ to satisfactions and commands the^ / to take upon
the^ a solitary life / or to make a pilgrimage unto. S. James / or to build
temples / or to edify great Cathedral churches and monasteries to singe
Masses and to buy Pardons and soche like. These be not the ways or means /
whereby the remyssyon of sin may happen unto the. These thy pilgrimages and
these thy works and goods thou maiste co^uerte i^to a^ other and better use.
In this business (as much as apparteineth unto the means of health) they shall
proffit the nothing at all. For here it comes to pass as it is said / when
muses takes upon him his horns ande does strike the / that is to wit /
when by the law / he does declare unto the thy sins and the greatness and
multitude of the^ ande so does cast the into quaking fears and desperation.
Than art thou no longer in that great nombre of men that are full of securite
/ and have forgotten to sorrow / and can not repent / and are obdurate / but
in that little nombre of these that do acknowledge their misery and sins /
and do feel them / and therefore they weep / wail and tremble at the russhyng
af a leaf / and at the shadow of a read that is moved. Unto those a help is
prepared. Unto those Christ says I / I say / have instituted and establysshed
that kingdom of grace / which shall consume / abolish swallow up and destroy
sins and death / and shall bring unto the justice / and life.

Say not therefore. Where shall I find it? where shall I seek it? Must I take
any Iornate toward Room or toward Jerusalem? Not so. For if thou should
ascend into heaven with golden ladders / if it might be brought to pass / yet
should thou not obtain that thing / by this means / that thou desire.
But this thou must do. Behold and faste^ in thy mind these words ande
commandment of Christ. Who says / I send you etc. As who should say. It
was needful that I should come first unto you / that I should declare unto you
by the Gospel or glad tidinges / the will of my father / and that I should
institute sacraments and absolutio^ / or else you could not have come unto
me. Truly because / I can not be corporally in all places of the woorlde under
a visyble form / neither shall I be always present in this propre parson /
therefore do I that that my father has done. He has sent me into this little
a^gle of the world / i^to Jury / that I should teach in it. But what taught he?
He taught the glad tidi^ges for the comfort of miserable sinners / that were
in Jury / he healed the sick and did resuscitate the dead. This was the work
and ministry given unto him in commandment. For this was he sent from his
father. There and to this was he wholly given. In those places was he
co^uersaunt / and did his office with faithful intent and sedulite / not in
the Courts of noble men / amongst glotons / smelkitche^s these raueners more
like swyne than me^ / not with Annas and Caiphas and other Iusticers / rich
and wise before the world / and soche like me^ne / but amongst the bli^de /
the lame / the dismembered / the halting / the lepers / the deaf / the dead and
amongst the miserable sheep that were wretchedly seduced and strayinge
abroad. With those was he present / those did he make of / these did he help
/ curyng them both in body and soul / bringing unto them the most precious
ande inestimable treasure of the world / which no creature has (much more
can it not give it) except it receive it from him / that is to say / Justice
ande everlasting health.

Thus says he here / You shall also. do it in all places where as you shall
come And for that same cause I send you / that you run and be my Apostles
ande messangers through all the world. And unto this office you shall ordain
and appointe others also / the which may teach ande do the self same thing /
unto the which I was sent from my father. And you are sent by me / until the
worlds end ande I shall be always present with you / that you may know that
you are not they that do that thing / but I by you.

By the force and strengt^ of this commandment / we also have obtained power
ande faculte / to comfort the sad and careful conscyences / ande to absoyle
them from sin. Ande we know when we execute this mynysterye or exercise this
act / that we our selves do it not / but that Christ him self does it.
Wherefore every virtuous man / in this case ande busynes / must think / when he
hears his curate or the precher so in the pulpitt / that he hears not man /
but God him self speakinge / than may he be certain / eande appointe in his
mind / that he has received full remyssyon of all his sins / neither is
there left any sticking or doubt any more. For truly Christ has so
instituted by his resurrection / that if any man that is laufully called the
mynister of the Church / or who soever finally in extreme necessyte does
absoyle from sins his neighbor that is astonyed and doubtefull in mind ande
desirous of comfort / the same is of so much effect and value / as though GOD
him self had done it / if truly it be done by his commandment and in his
name.

Wherefore / when two after this sort entreat and talk betwyxt them selves /
they are gathered to gether in the name of CHRIST. For like as it is above
said unto us / none of the^ both / here desires or seeks for the goods of
the other / like as the Papists and gapers for advau^tage do / which do not
only pol but also pill the Church / which do sing ande distill into the sick
soche or like words / O man / the hour is now at hand that does call the
from he^s. Remember how thou wylt dispose thy goods and thy faculties / that
they may be bestowed into virtuous or Godly uses. The avarice or couetuousnes
of the Papists.
See that thou forget not thy wretched soul / and see that thou provide for
the health of it. Give unto us one part of thy goods / and we shall pray for
the / ande we shall do many good works for the / and the merits of all our
good works / shall be comune unto the / with us. The saying of a faithful
mynyster unto the sick.
This does not he / which is godly in deed speak unto the sick / but uses
these / or soch like words. O my friend the opportunite of the place and time
/ or the case of thy infirmete does not now suffer us to have many things to
do of thy money ande of thy earthely goods / let other men take cure of those.
I see thy heart to be troubled or stryken with the fear of death / and that
thou art in conflict with desperatyon / and that thou haste not sufficient
help of thy self whereby thou may be able to rydde thy self out of that
danger / and confirm thy mind against those fearful things. But take a
good heart unto the / Christ has instituted a ki^gdom in earth full of
consolation and beatitude / when he said / like as my father has sent me so
do I se^d you / with these words / he has consecrated us all to be priests /
for this purpose / that one should declare unto other the remission of si^nes.
And therefore / I now come unto the in the name of the same our lord Jesus
Christ / and I bid the to be of good comfort. There is no cause why thou
should fear. There is nothing why thou sholdest quake and be of a desperate
mind / as though there were no solace / help or counsel any where. Do thou
not hear that Christ came not for the just / but for sinners to the purpose to
save them? Wherefore take a good heart unto the / trust assuredly / receue this
glad tidinges with a glad mind / and with thy heart re^dre unto him thanks
for this tidinges which he brings unto the by me / without all labor / care
ande charge of thy self. And besides this / also he has given commandment /
that I should remytre unto the thy sins / wherefore I forgive all thy sins
unto the / in the name of the Father / the son ande the holyghoost. Wherefore
/ now with a glad mi^de / say these words O most merciful God O heavenly
Father I thank the / that thou have forgeuen unto me my sins / by thy derely
beloved son Jesus Christ nor doubt not / but of the lord hi^ self the
hauenly father thou art absoyled of thy universal sins.

Of this thou see / that these words of the office of the keys does i^ no
wise co^fyrme and establish the tirannie of the po^. For christ did not
therefore give these keys. He did not therefore i^stitute this ministry / that
I should e^riche the / or thou me / or that I should be lord over the / or that
thou should be compelled to be subject unto me / as the pope does convert it
into wordly power / magnyfycence and dominion by the which act he sets
forth and does testify / most manyfestly / that he him self is a great
Rybaulde / Antechrist him self / most wicked / full of contuma^te and a
despiser of GOD / a blasphem^s and a mocker of CHRIST ande the traitor of his
Church. For Christ would not this / as I have said. He has not by these
words instituted any wordly Kingdom and tyranny / but he had an eye to this
purpose / this he would / and therefore he did institute it / that coming unto
the^ wrastlyng with desperation / and gronyng under the hard burden of sins
(whether it be in the great agony of death / or any other time) I should say
unto the (intending to lift the up with comfort or counsel) let power /
money / honors dygnityes and riches be removed hens far of / now may there
not / neither ought any respect to be had of those things. But now must we
betwyxt us entreat and talk of the Kingdom of Christ / by the which only /
and by none other thou can be delivered from sin and death.

This truly is not a forrayne ande a worldly power and dominion / but it is an
office and a ministry. For here truly I seek for nothing of the / I neither
hawke nor wowe for any thing whereby I may be enryched / or to be lord over
the / and whereby I may make the subject unto me / and to make the my
handseruaunt / but I serve ande do exhibit the greatest office that may be
unto the. I bring unto the a great and inestymable treasure / not gold or
silver / but where as thy heart that is oppressed with heavy care / does covet
to be comforted / delivered ande confyrmed / ande to have GOD merciful unto
the in heaven. Therefore come I unto the bri^ging unto the / the most true
Gospel or tidings that is most gladdest / most pleasant and most to be
desired / not of my self / not of my good intent / or of my propre counsel /
but by the commau^deme^t and message of Christ. Who says / Come you all unto
me / that labor and are lade^ / I shall refresh you. Also / These thiges
which ye lowse upon earth / shall be lowsed in heaven / or else (as he says
here) Unto whom you shall remitte their sins / unto the^ are they forgeuen
etc. Is not this to serve? Is it not an office that is greatest of all? and not
to be compared withal for any man to do the better / when thankfully I bring
unto the an inestimable treasure that is heavenly ande everlasting? Which
neither thou / nor all the woorlde with all the goods and riches in it ca^
neither match nor buy with money? For what are the universal treasures of all
the world / the Iewelles of all kings / crowns / goods / gold / precious
stones / and what soever it makes most of / ande does wonder at it / what are
all those things in comparyson of this treasure / that is to say / the
remission of si^nes / by the which thou art delivered from the tyranny of
the Devell / of death ande of hell.

And art certyfyed that God the heavenly Father will be merciful unto the /
And so merciful / that for Christ's sake / thou must be the son and heir of
God / ande the brother and coheyre of Christ. Wherefore soche ande so great a
treasure as this is / can not be bought or sold / or wayed equally with money
/ the which thing the same our Judas Iscarioth the pope has done. For except
it be given ande taken thanckfully / and with mere grace / there is no cause why
that thou should trust to enjoy the same thing / or to take by it any
commodyte. For the gift of God is not gotten with money.

Truly I would not that any man should think that I have spoken these things
as though nothing ought to be given or employed upon the mynysters of the
church which syncerely and truly teach the word of God / whereby they may
nourish them selves / the which thing at this day certain parsons do gladlye
in many places / which do so envy their curates ande ministers of their
churches / that almoost they number ande measure everye morsel of meat that
comes within their Jaws / by all ways ande means that they can. They
steal and pike unto them selves those ecclesiastical goods / with the which
the pastors and mynisters of the word of God ought to be nourisshed. And in
so doying they declare openly / that their study is to drive the ministers of
the word unto extreme pouerte ad danger of famyne / and so to drive them from
them / that there may be none to teach / or to check their vices. Truly what
disturbaunce hereafter shall come. What desolation of the Church. What myserie.
Now great a barbarousnes shall there of follow we shall prove that / and that
shortly / except the magistrates find some remedy for this myschefe. In no
case therefore do I speak these things / nor yet so these things ought to be
understand / as who should say / that nothing should be given unto the
ministers of the Church. For these things are dew wnto the^ whereby they may
nourish ande sustain commodiously and easily / them selves and their family.
For except they have wherwyth to live / wherewith to cladde them selue / where
to dwell / and how to defend them selves / against the injury of cold ande
heat / they can not long do their office / but they shall be compelled
(forsakynge their office of teaching) to seek and find how to keep them
selves. The which thing when it comes to pass / the Gospel can noth long
remain. The which thing the deuell does and seeks for the same purpose / that
by this occasyon he may take our of the way and let the doctrine of the
Gospel.

A stypende is dew vnro the ministers of the Church / (...) the ordenau^ce of
God.
And that things are dew unto them / whereby they may aptely nourish the^
selves / Christ does teach that openly where he says. The labourer is worthy
of his reward. S. Paul also. He that is instructed / must communicate unto him
that does instruct him in all good things. And he does add a term / whereby
justly those wicked parsons ought to be feared / the which is this. God is not
mocked. Also. 1 Timoth. the. 5. Seniour or prestes that are right in auctorne
/ or that do gouuerne well / are worthy to be had in doub^ honor specially
those that by word ande teaching do labor. If that therefore stipendes be
given unto other that are public officers in thiges that they serve unto a
communalte / that by the same they may with more expedition serve the turn
whereunto they are called / much more is it dew unto the ministers of the word
/ for truly when we have with all diligence and good will / given unto them
all things / whereby they may live commodiously / yet must ye say this. This
stipend / this money or this grain which we give unto the curate or minister
of the word / we give it not for sermons or absolutio^. (the which are not the
propre things of those ministers but of God / ande therefore they can not be
sold of them for money) but for as much as God has so ordained / that we
should hear ande receive the word and his Sacraments / of men. Therefore is
it necessary that they be norisshed of the comun charge / or of the public
treasure / or by our comune wagis. And we shall give the^ with glad mide / that
they may have whervppo^ to live / and that by that ways they may with better
expedition do their office. The which thing if it were not done / they should
be compelled to renounce their office / and so should we be spoiled of the
doctrine of the Gospel.

These things are most true / and in deed of necessyte must be so done.
Further more if the doctrine of the GOSPEL ought to be Preached purely ande to
be sect over or left unto the posterytyte pure / We must provide not only for
the ministers of the word a commodious living / but we must beware and watch
with all care ande study also / that the places appointed to teach in / or
scooles of learning / may have apt Parsons / and that wi^h out difficulte
the rulers of the scooles / Stipendes must be given unto Scoolemasters
and the teachers of childeren may have also meat and drink and stipendes
whereby they may commodiously sustain them selves / whereby those may be
brought up / which in time to come may be not only comune preachers or only
apt for that purpose that they may instruct with the word some one church /
but soch also / that may get unto the^ that doctrine and faculte that they
may be able not only to teach in a pulpit / but also to continue and resist
these that make secres and mad raging spirits / ande soch as are foolishsly
insensed with false opinions. For this use not only the Princes and
magistrates / but also the Cyteze^s and all the people of the country ought
comunely to give some part of their faculties / that scoles might be preserved
/ and that the church may always have such men / the which truly she can not
lack / if the purite of the doctrine and the health of the congregation or
church ought to be maynteyned.

For of chese things that you have heard / you may easily gather / how
great and how incomparable a treasure ande not able to be esteemed / is the
puryte ande absolu^o^ of the Gospel / if it be heard and received in a true
sense of a right and laufull minister / when he comes unto the being sick /
and does comfort the / thou ought assuredly to persuade thy self / and to
believe / that Christ the lord him felfe does comme unto the and comfort the.
For no man would ever so presume to come so unto the / without the commandment
of God / neither could any man help the with comfort or counsel / or give
the any aid. Now trvly / seeing thou hear that God him self does command
it / thou may without doubt / and with a glad mind say here christ him
self comes unto me / in my confessor or curate. For he does not speak his
own but the word of god / for the which he is sent and the which is given in
commandment unto him of God. This / when a man has persuaded with him self
/ that God has sent him / and has commanded those things to be declared /
than does the fear and the carfulness of the conscience decrease and is
quenched / than is the mind erected and pacefyed which comfort / and begins
to have a good hope / neither is there than any cause why to waver and to be in
doubt ande to be in a wane hope and to stick in doubt. The which thing must
needs be in those that follow the doctrine of the pope. The Popes doctrine of
absolution.
For that doctrine taught that men ought to doubt / neither did that absoyle
any man from sins except he departed with sufficient ande due justice / and
full contricion / ande had cofessed all his sins. Here was no mention made /
not so much as a word of faith / ande of the virtue of the keys that are
institute by Christ. Truly this doctrine ande knowledge was so obscured ande
unknown / ande plainly buried / that I my self / even than when I was made
doctor / (which certeynly ought by no means to be rude or ignorant in this
matter) did think no otherwise / nor taught otherwise / then that than finally
the sins to be remitted unto me and unto other / if we had done / or had to a
full and just sort parfect or due contrition / ande were confessed. But of a
truth / if our sins should not be forgeuen unto us / before that we with our
co^trition or compunction and with other good works should way down the
same / and before that nothing might be required in them / than might I never
trust for any remission of sins. For I can never determyne with my self that
I have done full and just contrycion / and therefore accordig unto that / no man
can absoile / whether he be Pope or any other what soever he be.

So by the popysh lies the consciences are miserably seduced and called away
from the word of faith and the commandment of God / unto his uncertain
contrition and compunction of heart. And this their doctrine has gotten by
extortion infinite sommes of money / and has increased them with great ample
riches and kingdoms. The occasyon of the popysh power
And by this means also / so many Temples monasteries great Churches / ande
Cathedral Churches / Chappelles and Aulters are builded and endued with large
or ample gifts ande costs. And at this day their are bulls and Popyshe
pardones that are sufficient witnesses of these things / and does confyrme
those buyldinges ande gifts / by the which the POPE has wretchelye deceived
all the woorlde / ande has by these faierynges / or buying and selligdone so
much harm unto the Church of Christ / that no man can compryse with mind /
nor express with words the greatness of that calamite and injury.

For that cause / we do often and diligently exhort. And let those with us
with continual study do the same / that in this case does help us / as many
as may / that scoles / cur^s and ministries of the world / be earnestly
maintained / least soche an other error / or rather worse (the which thing
Satan does endeavor with the greatest study that he can) crepe in again. The
means to conserve the Gospel pure.
If truly we will prevent and withstand this mischefe / that ca^ no otherwise
be done better / than if the youth even from their young ande tender age / be
well ande virtuously taught and brought up / the which succeding after us /
when we are departed unto Christ / may not only set forth and beat into the
people diligently the pure doctrine / but also may defend the same / against
mad raging and erroneous teachers / and put of wicked and false / opinions
For truly it is a great benefyt of God / when soch parso^s are apoi^ted
ministers / the which do syncerely teach the word of GOD rightly and purely.
And besides those also / it is necessary that some be that can preserve
learning / and defend the same / least the Church be infected and corrupted
with their poison and wicked errors. The necessyte of scoles.
For that purpose it is necessary / that universities or scooles be maynteyned
/ from whence soch men do at length come / the which may fight or contend for
the doctrine / ande preserve the purite of the same.

When truly we do employ to this purpose either our labor or faculties / that
soch men may be in the Church / that may teach purely and that may also
comfort the sorrowful ande afflicted conciensces / according unto the
commandment of Christ (as we have said) and may refrain and convince the
wolves and wicked doctors. And when those have well provided for them things
necessary / and large and due stipendes / than that ought not to be adjudged as
a sufficient recompense / wagis or price / for those benefits which happen
unto us by the^ / but it must be thought that it is a thankful sacrifice / and
a giving of thanks and a due praise unto God. Prayers must be made for the
preachers of the church.
And also we must diligently pray / like as Christ does admonish us / that he
will vouchsafe to send soch work men into his harvest. For why? teachers
truly shall always be / but except he send them / they shall not be Godly /
faithful and pure.

After this form is it ryghtly taught and believed of the Kingdom of Christ /
and of the power and ministry of the keys. Ande if we direct our selves
after this form / than remain we Christians / and than may we parforme the
offices or duties that we owe both unto God and man / and sone dyscharge our
selves from all kind of doctrines ande opinions / and to judge of them
rightlye.

And then also shall we give GOD thanks from our heart / that he has
delivered us from the torments / slaughterhouse and tyranie of the Pope / who
does convert the power of the keys into a certain clear ande infinite power /
ande vproare ande a worldly dominion / when notwithstanding the power of the
keys was appointed and ordained of Christ / The end of the keys of Christ.
for this end ande use only that that treasure should be offered and exhibited
unto all the world / the which may be waied down and bought with no sommes of
money nor with no riches saving that we must testify and declare our benignite
piete or godlynes ande gratitude / with our benefietes / liberalite of our
faculties / and with our offices / toward those that do execute this
ministry / the which are worthy of double honor... Timoth. 5.

Let us therefore give thanks unto christ our lord / that he has by his
resurrection institute soch a kingdom of grace / for this purpose / that we
should have ande find in that in all our necessities and troubles / always a
present help and a sure comfort / neither is this treasure to be sought for /
out of regio^s far of / neither is there much labor or pains to be spent
for the same / neither are great costs to be done when we buy it unto us. For
Christ has given commandment and full power unto his Apostles / yea / in
necessite unto every virtuous man that believes in Christ even until the
worlds end / that they may erect and confirm those that are weain faith and
ready to fall into desperatio^ / with comfort. And in his name forgive sins.
etc. Of the which thing let this be spoken suffyciently.
