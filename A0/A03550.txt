Authoris in auxilium inuocatio.
YE sacred nymphs whose steps do trace
with fleres too and fro,
Ye sisters fair whose princely grace
to bathing Fountes do go.
Assist and aid the slender mind,
whose earnest will is bent
By painful toil to him assign
your fancy to content.
Mineruaes Lamp, dame Pallas clear,
or Tritons touch stone true
Exile from breast all childish fear,
with wisdom me indue.
To breath and blast in thundering verse,
such dainties as be rare,
Or iunckets fine, such to rehearse,
as Stewardes few prepare.
Condect with pearl, adornd with stone,
environed with Gold:
Ablasing Glass to look upon,
or pleasant to behold.
Direct Thalia quiuering quill,
Sicelides come me
Ye ternall sisters (if ye will,)
assist me to reply.
Guide trembling joints, guide fancy free,
to show her simple skill,
And Phoebus chief help speedely,
my promise to fulfill.
So shall I pass, this toyling clogge,
and finish your desire,
So shall I escape the lothsom logge,
and unto joys aspire.
Come near, we yield to thy request,
(...) granted shall it be.
I thank ye dames that your behest,
vouchsafes to pleasure me.
I greet you all farewell a while,
I thank you euerichone,
This friendly Banquet to compyle,
my self shall take upon.
FINIS.
Demosthenes the Master of the Banquet, Sosia his Steward.
FRiend Sosia listen and attend,
what news I shall relate,
To this my phrase this audit tend,
and mark thereof the state.
I have decreed for to conuiue,
the muses every one,
With dainty meats, but first isle shriue
my self to thee alone.
I walking through the prate or green,
of Helicone that spring,
These Lanterns bright did view a queen,
her mate a princely King.
He decked with flamed shyning beams,
or brightness of the Sun,
And from her eyes large silver streams,
supposed were to run.
The Queen the regal King did call,
and termd him, Phoebus bright,
And after them ensewed all,
the muses to my sight.
Sicelides did formest trace,
their robes as green as grass,
And next Pyerides took place,
as clear as Crystal glass.
Sicelides their scutchins bare,
upon their humers hie,
Which wisdom seemed to declare,
surmounting starrie sky.
Aetherion Globes or circuits round,
Pyerides did hold,
Containing sciences profounde,
be set with glistering Gold.
These sights delited much my mind,
so that I greedy was,
With serious toil the place to find,
through which their feet did pass.
In dumps I tended to and fro,
the semits were obscure
Yet last I pressed for to go,
where fancy did procure.
And Fancy Fancy like did lead,
to complish her request,
And brought me straight unto a bed,
where I did seem to rest:
So decked with pleasant Odours sweet,
a pleasure for to smell,
That sure I did suppose it meet,
a season their to dwell.
Thus sanu^e yelding to delight,
I fell in slombring sleep,
And waking, dames with Torches bright,
my corpse did charely keep.
The one a fading Rose did bear,
dame heautie was her name:
The other Fortune as you hear,
a blind and fickle dame
With yt in Trance my sprites were gast
and Torchlight did amase
My lively senses almost past,
that staring I did gase,
Scarce breathing breathles was my heart,
and grief did so assail,
That sure I doubted pinching dart,
against me should avail,
Then of a sudden, beauties Rose,
was faded to the stalk,
And Lady Fortune, with her gloss,
constrained was to walk.
O formose puer, numu^ ne creed colori. Cicero. pares cum paribus facilime
congregantur. Alias, Similes habent labra lactucas.
For on the wale fair written was,
that beauty is but vain,
Which adage as it came to pass,
made beauty to reframe.
Than likewise in an other place,
dame Fortune was definde:
With nipping cuts for to deface,
her pomp and lofty mind.
Insculped brief, if that the blind,
the blind do seem to lead,
The proverb true needs must I find,
more fools are brought to bed.
Thus winding not from midst my thrale,
wherein I cheyned was,
Into a princely court or hall,
by wandering, I did pass:
The roufe whereof was Iuorie bone,
the pillors beaten Gold,
The windows decked with pearl and stone,
full costly to behold.
In midst whereof a Bath did spring,
which did my heart inflame,
So rather that than any thing,
I would have taste the same.
Thus still desire did press to prove,
the thing it would attain,
And eke my greedy mind did moan,
therein to take some pain.
I faynted like a feeble hound,
and coueted to drink,
But yet the liquors did rebound,
when lips were at the brinke.
Like Tantalus I had despair,
which lives in doleful pain,
Who when the waters proch him fair,
they ebb as fast again.
Thus gasing sometime here and there,
Chastitas, Sapientia, Scientia.
in midst of all my grief,
Three Nymphs of sudden did appear,
which did me much relief.
Sosia. My Leach if this be manifest,
which you protest as true,
I wonder much how you were blessed,
such wondrous sightes to view,
Spied you in midst of Crystal stream,
three Ladies passing glee?
I doubt your worship did but dream,
effigies such to see.

Demost. If Titans Chariot chase the sky,
throughout Auroraes race,
Then this as true none can deny,
I was in present place.

Sosia. Then by request might boldness crave,
a pardon at your hand,
With smiling face, and countnance grave,
their names to understand.

Demost. Relation made approach me nie,
I grant to thy request,
And final thus I do reply,
because I love thee best.
Dame Sapience, first, the^ chasted Queen,
possessed the second rain,
And Lady Science to be seen,
last peared very plain,
Each offered me a precious gift,
most wondrous to behold,
But Science one my head did lift,
a crown of perfect Gold
This done such music did abound,
as gast my senses all.
So that incontinent to ground,
in Trance my corpse did fall.
Then at the latter pinch and eb,
of this my mortal life,
When sisters black had shredde my web,
I longed for a wife.
The Muses hearing this my moan,
consented unto me
That verdit given of every one,
straight wedded should I be,
Then, who could like me should me have,
and whom I lykt again,
This they decreed, to keep from grave,
the body nighe hand slain.
These golden darlings marked me well,
with fired eyes so ryfe,
And poynted Science last to dwell
with me, for term of life
Content was pleased, she gave her troth,
I coupled faith and hand,
That while the air did feed us both,
her husband would I stand.
Then lead we were in sacred wise,
into the Temple sweet,
Where Vesta by her wonted guyse,
did has our tender feet.
Thus were we married, know the case
and this take by the way,
My wedding Banquet in this place,
I purpose here to day:
Therefore such Cates as costly be,
I charge thee to prepare,
And thus much more attend to me,
three dainty dishes rare.

Sosia. Far fet they say and dearly bought,
fine daintrels does delight,
Now every corner must be sought,
to please their appetite
I run, I trace, I fiske and jette,
I raunge from street, to street
To kill with Hawk, or catch with nete,
such wild foul as I meet.
Trudge Sosia, trudge, festine with speed,
thy pillors do prepare,
But Lixa, see the hounds ye feed,
against we course the Hare.
I know not I, what Cates to buy,
for dainties common be
Such diverse meats, unfeignedly,
as serves each degree.

Demost. I pray thee zelously my friend,
search out the very best,
For peerles dames I do intend,
shall be my poynted gest.
Both Phessaunt, Plouer, Lark, and Quail,
with Rabbet, Succors young,
Of dainties these let me not fail,
with other rares among.
As Marchpaine, Cheese and Ginger green,
with sucket pleasant sweet,
Blauncht Almondes, as in court is seen,
for princely Ladies, meet.
Stewde Proynes, conserve of Cherries red,
Pears, Biskets, Sugar fine,
With nectar dulce, since I am wedde,
by voice of Muses nine,

Sosia. What Iunckets call ye these I pray,
no dainties can they seem,
For vulgar sort from day to day,
as common them esteem.
They serve as food for to sustain,
the hungry corpse withal,
So that the Nymphs from them refrain,
as we refrain from gall.
For sacred powers of starrie sky,
their natures do consist,
Nauing at pleasure pleasauntly,
to has them where they list.
And sequent then for to conclude,
if they be souls above,
What whight their favors to delude,
with earthly Cates would prove,
Therefore endeavor to invent,
by cunning art and skill,
Some dainty dish incontinent,
thy promise to fulfill.
For naughtes avails to provide
great things of small effect,
Stay, stop therefore, pause and abide,
this zealous zeal reject.

Demost. Thy judgment sounds to the ear,
with reason firm in deed,
And therefore greedy more to hear,
I pray thee to proceed.

Sosia. Where foolish judgment rooteth deep,
and fondness bears fruit:
There witless will is brought a sleep,
by fancies feeble suit.
Sus Miueruam.
And then the proverbs proof is found.
Sus does Mineruam teach,
Therefore with bended knee to ground,
grant pardon learned leach.
For what I would, I can not say,
and what I can, I may not,
Therefore without longer delay,
proceed with speed and stay not.

Demost. Why license francke is granted free,
let pardon thee suffice,
Set dread a part, and show to me,
the sprigges of thy devise.

Sosia. Where ignorance does lead the route,
and guide the ensign free:
There oftentimes it comes about,
that bloody fildes we see.
And therefore as you pardon grant,
so pardon I request,
He is unwise that seems to vaunt,
on that he knows least.
For wisdoms loare to take in hand,
for Cooks it is unfit,
And wisemen as you understand,
will know before they knit.

Demost. Then tratting need constraines to way,
a salve with posting speed:
Hark, Sosia mark this present day,
I pray thee to proceed.
Unto my place, consisting still,
mention for to frame
Whereby I may complet my will,
and bring about the same.
And I shall to the Temple hie,
the muses to implore
To aid my wracked fantasy,
that then I might adore.

Sosia. Thy servant will is ready bente,
to grant to thy desire:
Behold progresses do relent,
and homewarde I retire.

Demost. Adieu, farewell, farewell, adieu,
Valeto Sofia mi,
Adieu, adieu, my friend so true
thy busenesse do appli.

Sosia. Farewell, in this though I be blind,
yet I may draw my bow,
In such a sort to please thy mind,
and kill the crafty Crow.

Exit Sosia.

Demosthenis quaerimonia.
Demost. Where ebs, and flows of painful grief
in siely ship did toss
Of late my ghost, now misbeliefe
defines mine endless loss.
In thraldomes thore (I) rule the roast,
in fluctes of blistesse woe,
A pillor or a propping post,
my pleasure I forgo.
Yet though my fancy naught can veil,
naught trickling tears do show,
But when that wilful cares assail,
I catch the overthrow.
Therefore since nothing is so dure,
but labor can attain,
As Poems do my breast assure,
I mind to take the pain.
And this I know he is unmeet,
that will not taste the sower,
To be a guster of the sweet,
in moment of an hour.

Scientia. Chastitas and Sapientia. Dear spouse, what senseless rage does bind,
thy wits in such a maze?
Or else what fogges of mistie mind,
do cause thee thus to gaze?

Demost. Dear dame, whose virtues manifold,
do penetrat the sky,
To vewe thy glistering eyes of Gold,
no man so glad as I.
As Science once, embrace, embrace,
with stretched arms thy dear,
And then he will define the case,
of this his heavy cheer.

Scientia. Science is bound to yield by right,
unto her friendly Lord,
And therefore see, with all my might,
to this I do accord,
Disclose therefore, thy secrets all,
take time while time may be,
Meridies.
For Phoebus mean does nigh hand call,
provision for to see.

Demost. Provision that, needs must I wayle,
to think upon the same,
For all my senses do me fail,
when dainties you do name.
Where shall I find, a dainty dish?
where shall I any buy?
For dainties none of flesh nor fish,
in all the world I spy.

Sapience. Great store, and plenteous plenty is
contained every where,
Rejoice therefore we will not miss,
approach dame Wisdom near.

Demost. O blisfull Nymph, O Lamp of trust,
O glistering Diamond bright,
In whom I hope and ever must,
the perfect Lantern light.
I thank thee thrice and ten times thrice,
I grate thee evermore,
That wisdom thine, through thy devise,
has salude my present sore,

Chastity. Where Science knits a perfect knot,
there Sapience ta keth place,
And chasted life deuoyde of spot,
does govern all the race.
The sincere path, the rule of life
by me prescribed is,
The comforte-true of man or wife,
the endless state of bliss.
But briefly show what grievous sore,
does pester in thy mind,
That transingly still more and more,
no sistaunce thou do find:

Demost. Consider Jewels precious dear,
my purpose and intent,
Is to conuiue, attend and hear,
the Muses with assent.
And Cates delicious to provide,
I think it very fit,
But more I seek, the more as wide,
the mark I can not hit.

Sapience. Learn well and mark, print in thy mind,
what Iuuenal does wright,
Iuuenal. Rara auis in terris, nigroque simillima Cygno.
By friendship true which rare I find,
as nigred Swaunne to sight.
And this, examples do approve,
yet one I will declare,
As principal somewhat to move,
thy clogged breast with care.
In friendship fraud is this ye know,
for Pompei was a friend,
And Fraud gave Caesar such a blow,
that Friendship had no end.
For rattling speech with great disdain,
did frame such sore debate,
That where as love was wont to reign,
insued deadly hate.
With roaring rage the Cannons rent,
and Martial feats to try,
Betwixt them both they did convent,
in twinkling of an eye.
Here Pompei led his valiant host,
here marched he a main,
There valiant Caesar seemed to bost,
himself with all his train.
Here Pompei gave the onset free,
him Caesar did withstand,
Here Julius was constraynd to flee,
himself with all his band.
Pompeius followed for a space,
and then did back retire,
Reporting that a boy to chase,
was last he did desire.
When Pompey thought he had the best,
and doubted naught at all,
Then Caesar as a sausie gest,
for bloody war did call.
His ensign boldly to display,
he pressed with spear and shield,
Bestowing in a comely ray,
his army in the field.
Of hautie mind, of courage stout,
of stomach stiff and boulde,
By whom his souldiars had no doubt,
the conquest for to houlde.
When word came to Pompeius ear,
how every case did stand,
With lively hope douoyd of fear,
he took his charge in hand.
As manly as Beterophon,
fierce Caesar's might to try,
A Knight in stole Armigeron,
on him to live or die.
The Trumpets sounded out full shrill,
the onset was begun,
No word was there but slay and kill,
from morn till glead of Sun.
Pompeius feet began to fail,
his knees to earth did bend,
Yet valiauntly he did not quail,
but forward bid to tend.
Declaring that the ground did quake,
friendly his manhood to salute,
And questing them to take,
the words he did impute.
The souldiars greedy of their pray,
set all at-sire and seven,
And fought so cruel that same day,
the strokes did sound to Heaven
The vewers of this dreadful fight
compared it to be,
Coequall to the clipsed sight,
that in the ayle we see.
But fickle Fortune changed at last,
by turning of her wheel,
Pompeius state, that now aghast,
compeld he was to reele.
To him, whom once he did restore,
exiled from his reign,
That now with scepter in his Thore,
he bare the sway again.
This prince as soon as he did see
Pompeius once his friend,
For friendship his did straight decree,
of him to make an end.
But first in courtious sort and skill,
he friendly did him greet,
And for to cloak his spiteful will,
he met him in the street,
Then feasting him with roast meat free,
he beat him with the Spit,
And sent him forth most Iudasly,
as he supposed fit.
To show him pleasure to his pain,
as it did well appear,
For on the water he was slain,
which murdering did not fear,
And straight presented for a gift,
to Caesar, Pompeius head,
Thus fickle Fortune drive the drift,
that change of choice did lead.
Here friendship fleeted by disdain,
for Pompei proved true,
Which for his trust mess full plain,
bad fading life adue.
And whom he counted least his foe,
and for his chiefest frinde,
By wilful hap it chanced so,
did kill him in the end.
Ouidius. En ego, non paucis quondam munitus amicis: Dum slauit velis aura
secunda meis: vt fera nymboso tumueruut aequora ve^to: In medijs lacera puppe
relinquor aquis.
And Ovid says if riches flow,
and honor thou obtain,
So long the wind with thee will blow,
and friends to thee remain,
But when the day is ouercast,
with clouds from Fortunes throne,
Then will false friends from thee flee fast,
and leave thee all alone.
Therrfore a dainty dish it is,
a trusty wight to find,
Which in a tempest will not miss,
to prove to the full kind,
True, Lodvvicke sleeps in to^be of stone,
his carcas wrapped in leadde,
And Alexander true is gone,
subject to earthly bed,
Now counterfets, which friendly bear,
two faces in one hoode,
With cloakes dissembling do appear,
to suck our friendly blood.
In stead of love, there hatred grows,
where truth should take a place,
Their sweltring waves and scourges flow,
of spitfull Fortunes face.
The strongest Oak is seldom sure,
and soonest overthrown,
The friend which friendly did endure,
at last away is blown.
The brother pareth for to gloss,
his brother to beguile,
And friends are changed often to foes,
within a little while.
Thus therefore for because I know,
and likewise plainly see
Thy Banquet thin, I will bestow
this dainty dish on thee.
That seek abroad and seldom find,
a trusty friend in deed,
To whom thou may declare thy mind,
when time requires need.

Demost. Of dainties all I must consent,
this dainty for to be,
For friendships Bow is seldom bent,
the proof we daily see.
I thank thee Sapience from the heart,
if it lie in my lotte,
Thy gentleness which heales my smart,
shall never be forgot.

Sapientia, And I do muse what diligence,
as children do bestow,
Their parents for to recompense,
with honor that they owe.
For duty due, is fled away,
and humbleness is gone,
And true obedience at this day,
is colder than the stone.
Unbridled youth, has no delight,
dame Virtue to embrace,
But still endeavor with their might,
her branches to deface.
Go vewe abroad in every coast.
and seem a child to train
In Godly life, and all is lost,
within a year or twain.
As Ploughmen rude they do prepare,
king Neroes seed to sow,
Whose deuslish fancy had the care,
his mothers womb to know.
And trained her even as the sheep,
are trained to their bayne,
Who falling in a slombring sleep,
with bloody knyfe was slain.
For Nero slit her secret womb,
to see if he could spy,
The tender cell, or chatrie Tomb,
where he was wont to lie.
Such small regard had he unto,
his tender mothers breast,
That beastly nature made him do,
the thing she doubted least.
Even like I say at present stint,
the world is never other,
So that the childrens breast as flint,
is stony to the mother.
For when the parents taking pain,
at last do wax full old,
The children wish to have them slain,
that they might have their Gold.
Now plain deceit, has chose a seat,
now falshoode rules the land,
Now love is cold, now children threat,
their parents to withstand,
How many buddes of human seed,
how many sons remain,
That will about their fayres proceed,
to cause their fathers gain?
Nay every man is fully bent,
his propper Chestes to fill,
So that they care not with assent,
if that their father spill.
Where spring the branches of the tree,
where Isaac was the root?
Where shall you find a simile
to set by him his foot.
If any answer in this case,
then nusquam he must say,
For well I know that Phoebus face,
does foster none to day.
For plyant was he at a beck,
and ready at a call,
To take a Faggot one his neck,
to sacrifice withal.
And when as Abraham did declare,
how Isaac needs must die,
Most willingly he did prepare,
and would hint not deny.
But patiently he took the cross,
and kneeled on his knee,
Believing that this mortal loss,
was but a fond decree.
What children now would pleased be,
if this you should request?
Or who would yield so quietly,
to grant to your behest?
They be not borne, nor live by bread,
throughout the world I see,
That covet rather to be dead,
than leave this worldly glee.
Then farther to the whole effect,
and search the pithie style,
And tell me if you do respect,
what news within a while.
He was obedient, in so much
his parents did him show,
The doctrine pure, of Scriptures such,
whereby the Lord we know,
They framde his steps to virtues trace,
they learnde him how to knit,
The perfect web, of heavenly grace,
they ruled him with a bit.
They made him to suppress desire,
his tongue they sought to iame,
Because of little sparked of fire,
proceeds forth a flame.
They kept with rod of wisedoms school,
his childhoode in such awe,
That carnal blindness waxed tool,
so well he knew the law.
They did discharge their duties right,
they let him not to stray,
But causde him with an humble spright,
to wander day by day.
His oaths were nay, his swearing ye,
adherent to the word,
His dealing was from craft full free,
as scriptures do accord.

Demost. Why? then by this you seem to prove,
faultlesse the child to be.

Science Not so but fancy did me move,
both faults to let thee see.
For if the Colt might seem to raunge,
and never to be broken,
The Bit and Bridle would be strange,
this is a certain token.
And therefore since that every man,
is faulty, think no less,
But that the child, do what he can,
is but a sinful guess.
Omni morbo paratur medicina,
Yet if the wound were nere so sore,
a salve is to be found,
Which though it fester more and more,
at last will make it sound.
But where as suffrance seems to reign,
all for a little ease,
Their straight insueth grievous pain,
the former grief to pease.
As proof by this we have in hand,
thy fancy to suffice,
Where parents will not understand,
their childrens wicked guise.
But if they once begin to grow,
in rypenesse of their sin,
Though they their wicked hau^t do know,
they maintain them therein.
That ripe, soon rotten when they be,
then fades duty due,
So that their folly as ye see,
does cause themselves to rue.
And therefore, should they put in ure,
the wisemans saying mylde,
So long as breath does life procure,
let chastment rule the child,
For duty slips, a good cause why,
the parents make and mar,
So that this virtue certainly
must needs be absent far.
Thus what by Tutours fondness blind,
and nature of the sprigge,
The humble branches stark I find
vnplyant is the twigge.
Therefore this dainty for a dish,
of right thou may prepare,
For which a man may often wish,
but is reperted rare,
As much to say, obedience flame,
and inward heat is cold,
So that an humble child by name,
no man can once behold.
For fancy leads their thoughts astray,
and wilful will is bent,
The righteous children for to play,
with prodigal assent.
That is as long as any note,
of virtue does remain,
They lashe and lavish all a flote
till it be gone again.
The path that Joseph walked in,
is not for them to walk,
For why, their virtues very thin,
are faded to the stalk.
Abromnicio pleades their case,
with sanguine sword in hand,
A Justice diet in common place,
all goodness to withstand.
Thus pilgrim like, their race they run,
to no good point at all,
But as the Wax against the Sun,
does melt away, they fall.
That seldom sure or not at all,
an humble child to find,
A man may travail where he shall,
let this content thy mind.
And serve this for a second mess,
which I to thee assign,
Because thou do pretend as guess,
to feast the Muses nine.

Demost. What joys unto my breast aspire?
what gladness now does reign?
Her speech has set my heart one fire,
her talk has rid my pain.
A dainty dishe it is in deed,
a service hard to see,
Where as the child does render meede,
with lowly bended knee,
Unto his ancient fathers head,
where silver hairs do grow,
For children now are better fed,
than taught, fulwell I know.
Does not experience flac define
the Nurse constraynd to bow?
Unto her Cradell oftentime,
Which right does not allow.
Yes, right is wrong, and wrong is right,
unkindness cloak is kind,
The light is dark and darkness light,
the eyes that see be blind.
Thus dainty twain I have, but yet
the third is to be sought,
Which, if that I could seem to get,
full soon it should be bought.

Chastity. Neither can Gold attain the same,
but serious pain and royle,
Nor princely money bear the name,
without a fervent broyle.
For coin herein does naught prevail,
I mean in wisdoms lore,
The scaling of the walls t'assaile,
where Science keeps the door.
And therefore since as Authors old,
when they prepare to write,
Their learned Tables do unfold,
whereby they should indite.
Not otherwise by course I will
if thou with heed attend,
Endeavor with a simple skill,
the third dish for to end.
I mase and muse, in what degree,
as trusty wyfes do stand,
For well I spy, and plainly see,
few faithful in the land.
They love a while, the proverb old
to them may be replied,
Their love so whot is quickly cold,
it can not be denied.
Where rests faithful Sara now,
where is Rebecca pure,
Whose bended knees full often did bow,
her husbands grief to cure?
Where is Ioachims faithful wife,
Susanna calde by name,
Of whom dame virtues branches ryfe,
did work a worthy fame.
First Saraes purpose and intent,
to God was to accord:
And secondly with one assent,
to please her faithful Lord.
Rebecca, sought by charie charge,
her husbands quiet ease,
And wrought all means for to enlarge,
a salve his ire to pease.
Susannaes care was firmly cast,
her chasted vow to keep,
Despising every carnal blast,
that luld the soul a sleep.
For when the elders did conspire,
their pleasure blind to have,
By filthy lust of fleshly fire.
which made them so to rave.
That proching me, her hathing place,
unto her they did run,
With flattering style, and crafty face,
their purpose to have done.
The beams of grace did so inspire,
her worthy chasted mind,
That crackling sparks of fond desire,
her soul could never blind.
She rather chused for to dye,
to please their sinful lust,
Than to consent most toruedly,
to break her promise just,
Lo here the fruit of faithful state,
lo, here both trust and hope,
Lo, here dame virtue with her mate,
does seem to tend her scope.
Does present time the like declare,
are women now so true,
Unto their faith to have a care,
and eke their duty due?
Nay faith is fled, nay faith is dead,
nay faith is laid full low,
For every wight, with urgent spite,
gives faith the overthrow.
Now Venus does her banquets make,
and lust with painted book.
Proceeds herein the pains to take,
her darlings names to look,
Then first approaches to his hand,
the married femall knot,
And nigh to her there seems to stand,
the Maidens crazed pot.
So that as guider of this ray,
the harlot Pride is chief,
And Venus as a rector stay,
does aid them with relief.
Then Cupid with his bended Bow,
discharges forth his dart,
Upon those vessels weak and low,
that takes Venus part.
Thus wyfes do raunge in woeful sort,
thus snarring they do jar,
In leaving of their Thalame sport,
to hunt the For a far.
I will not say that all their might
does give their bodies free,
In leaving of the perfect light,
Of Venus court to be.
For I their Odours so do smell,
that needs I must suppose,
Their filthy shape, with her to dwell,
that virtue does repose.
of wedlock many break the hand,
that lincked is so fast,
Shall we, say they, as trusty stand
to one while life does last.
Not so, and why because that shame,
is chasced from their mind,
That shameless like their chasted name,
they dim, and mussell blind.
Or at the least if Venus net,
their fancy can not move,
They do endeavor for to get,
a salve for their behoue.
That is the Pehens proud to play,
the victory to obtain,
By which they hope an other day,
their husbands to disdain.
With chafing broyle, and chyding checks,
they do endeavor still,
To clogge and yoke their marits necks,
that they might have their will.
For one word twain, for two words three,
they practice and intend,
And all is for the masterie
to purchase in the end.
Thus as the old Cock often does crow,
the Cockzill learnes apase,
With notes full shrill his voice to show,
in every meeting place.
For damsels deck their hearts with pride,
and vaunt themselves so hie,
That all their care one every side,
is virtue to deny.
They make a gibe, and jesting stock,
at such as do despise
Their wicked factes, they grine and mock,
at every good devise.
For if their chasted life bear sway,
till twenty years be past,
Or one and twenty and a day,
that number is the last,
For banquets then of Venus kind,
they covet to attain,
Then Virgins Lamp is strocken blind,
and chastity is slain.
Thus wyfes be masters as ye see,
and masters made the foot,
So as before for victory,
to strive it is no boot.
Here as the rest has given to thee,
a dainty dish, so I
To please thy fainting fantasy,
the third will not deny.
That seek to find a trusty wife,
and travail thine is lost,
For many fragile be full ryfe,
but faithful few can bost.

Demost. A trusty friend an humble child,
a faithful wife say ye?
I do adjure by Marie mild,
these verte dainty be.
Now when it please, therefore to hear,
the Iunckets I suppose,
Most fittest for this royal cheer,
the same I will disclose.
First gaze I much where Justice true,
does plead the poor man's case.
And right is rendered, where as due
should seem to have a place.
For money makes them tread a wrie,
and turns the Cat in pan,
That should pronounce the equity,
to every kind of man.
Then secondly much more I muse,
where crafts men live upright,
Their ballaunce equally to use,
to every simple wight,
And last of all where shall we spy,
the servants to fulfill,
The seeds of service faithfully,
to please their masters will.
I doubt them all, yet may they be,
when as the sea does flame,
Or else I think assuredly,
few such do bear a name.
Thus now I judge my self well sped,
therefore I heartly pray,
That you would take the pains to lead
dame Science home to day.
And I the Muses every one,
will bid unto this feast,
But bound to you all three alone,
I covet for my geast.

Sapince. I Wisdom, Science by the palm,
will guide unto the place,
And sacred chasted life so calm,
shall not absent her face.
Make have therefore and stay not long,
with speed return again,

Exeunt. Request of Pallas us among
to dyne to take the pain.

Demost. Doubt not, what as your zeldus will
requesteth for to have,
To complish, isle endeavor still,
and Tritons friendship crane.
O withering grass, O fragile shade,
O slipperie Tower high,
Whose honor as the Hay does fade,
in twinkling of an eye.
Where naughts but vanity does dwell,
and beams of virtue fly,
A lurcking den, a hollow cell,
complet with misery.
Repent, with sobbing sighs lament,
your froward deuilish Art,
Least suddenly that you be shent,
of limboe taking part,
From which repentance may you bring
a wholesome salve and guide,
To rest with that eternal King,
whose glory does not glide.
Well, time does wish me to prepare,
To seek to Muses nine,
To gust and taste of dainties rare,
which you have heard us sign.
And in mean season I commend
you to the shepherd true,
In whom salvation without end,
does rest, and thus adue.

FINIS.
