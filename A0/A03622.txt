Joan. 1. Anno M.D.XLVIII.

Unto the Chrystiane Reader.
I Commend here unto thy cherite and Godly love Christian Reader / the ten
commandments of almighty God / wroten Exodus 20. and Deuteronomy. 5. the wiche
were yeuen to this use / an end / diligently to be lernid / and religiously
obseruid Deu. 4. Mat. 7. My mind / and commentaris in them I beseech the to
read with judgment / and give sentence with knolege: as Idout nothing at all
of thy cheryte / or godd willing heart toward me / and all well meaning
persons. But for asmouche as there can be no contract / peace / aliaunce / or
confederacye between too persons or more / except first the persons that will
contract / agree within them selfs upon souche things as shall be contractyd /
as thou right well knowyst: also seeing these ten commandments / ar nothing
else but the Tables or wrytinges that contain the conditions of the peace
between God and man Genesis 19. and declarithe at large / how / and to what the
persons named in the wrytinges ar bound unto the other: Gene. 17.22. Iere. 7.
I will be God / and you shall be my people. God and man ar knyt to gather / and
vnyt in one. It is necessary to know / how God / and man was made at one / that
souche conditions could be agreyed upon and confirmyd with souche solemn /
an public evidences / as these tables be / wroten with the finger of God.
The contents whereof byndithe God to ayede / and succur / keep / and preserve /
warrant / and defend man from all isle boothe of body and solle / and at the
last to give him eternal bliss and everlasting felicite: Exodus 19. Deuteronomy. 4.
Matt. 11. Joan. 3.4.5.6. Man bound of the other part to obey / serve / and
keep Gods commandments / to love him / honor him / and fere him above all
things. Were there not love / an Amite between God and man first / the one would
not bind him self to be master / another the other to be servant in souche a
frendlye / and blyssid sotiete / and felowshipp as these tables co^tayne.
Before therefore they were yeuen / good commaundyd Moses to go down from the
mount Synai unto the people / to know of them / whether they would confederat /
and enter alyaunce with him or not: Exodus 19. Moses did the messayge as God
bade him / where unto the people all to gather consentyd. So that is was fully
agreyd upon that God should be there God / and they his seruannes / with
certain conditions / containing thoffice of them boothe: God to make them a
peculier people / to prefer them above all nations of the earth / to make the^
a prynceli prysthode / and a holy people.

There office to obey / and observe his holy will and pleasure: Deuteronomy. 4. Exodus
19.

Here se we the aliaunce and confederacye made Between God and man / and the
wrytinnes yeuen: like wyce how it was made. But wherefore it was made / and for
who is merits / yet by these textes we se not: wy God should love man that so
neglectid his commandments / fauoryd and louyd / beliuyd and / trustyd
better the devil then God: Genes. 3. so far offendyd the divine majesty of
God / and degeneratid from grace / and godlynis by custom of sin and
contempt of God / that he bewalyd / and repentyd that ever he made man: Gene.
6. and decreyd to destroy the creature man / that he created / as he did in
deed. Not only thus destroing man / but also protestid openly / that better
it had been Judas never to have bin born / Matt. 26. and in the 25. chapter of
the same Gospel / the displeasure of God is declared so great / that he
apoyntithe man to an other / end then he was creatid for: saing / depart ye
doers of iniquite from me unto eternal fire / preparyd / not for man but for
the devil / and his Angels. What is now more contrary one to the other / and
farther at debate / then God and man / that now we se bound in lege to gather /
as very friends. Moses Deuteronomy. 9. shewithe / that only mercy prouokyd God unto
this aliance / to receive them into grace / deliver the^ out of Egypt / and to
possess the plentous land of Canaan: farther that God found just matter and
occation to expulse thin habitantes of that land / and found no merits in
thisraelites to give it them / for they were a styffeneckid people / and
intractable as Moses laythe / to there cherge / Deu. 9. How be it God having
respect only unto his promises made unto Adame / Abraham / and his posterite:
mesuryd not his mercy according to the merits of man / who was nothing but
sin / lokyd all ways apo^ the justice / and deseruings / innocensie / and
perfection of the blyssid sede promisid unto Adame / Gene. 3. and unto Abraham
/ Gene. 12.15.17. God put the death of Christ as amenes and arbiter of this
peace / Ebre. 9. For the Testament auaylythe not except it be confyrmyd by the
death of him that makithe the Testament: the which death in the judgment of
God was acceptyd as a satisfaction for sin from the beginning of Adames fall
/ as Paul says / Christ's prysthed was and is like unto Meldizedeck / that
had nether begin^ing nor ending: bound nether to time nether to place / as the
prished of Aron. but as God accomptid in Adams sin all man kind being in his
loins / worthy death: so he accomptyd in Christ all to be sauyd from death /
Apoca. 13. as Adame declarithe by the Name of his wief / called here Heua / the
mother of the living and not of the ded: Gene. 3. All these promises / and
other that apperteynid unto the salvation of Adame and his posterite / were
made in Christ and for Christ only: and appertainid unto our fathers / and us
/ as we appertainid unto Christ* he is the door / the way and the liffe: Joan.
10. he only is the mediator between God and man / with out whom noman can com
to the fader celestial: Joan. 1.3.6. Because the promises of God appertainid
unto our fathers / for asmouche as they like wyce unto Christ: hither unto and
for ever they were preseruyd from Hell and the pains dew unto Adames sin in
him / for who is sake the promise was made. The means of our peace and
reconsiliation with God / is only in Christ / as Esai says capit. 53. by who
is passion we are made hole. Therefore Christ is called by Johan the Baptist /
The lamme that takythe away the sin of the wrrold. Joan. 1. and as the
devil found nothing in Christ that he could eonde^ne / Io. 14. likewyce now /
he has nothing in us worthy damnation / be cause we be comprehendid / and
fully inclosyd in him / for we be his by faith. Al these that be comprehendid
under the promise / belong onto Christ. And as far extendithe the vertew / and
strenghe of Gods promise to saw man: as the rigor and justice of the law for
sin to damn man. For as by the offense and sin of one man / death was
extendid and made commune unto all men unto condemnation / as Paul says /
Romans 5. so by the justice of one / is deriuid lyffe into all men to
justification. The words of the promise made unto Adame and Abraham /
confirmithe the same* They are those. I will put ennymyte and hatred between the
and the woman / between thy seade / and the w^mannes sede / and heresede shall
break thy head Gene. 3. for as we were in Adame before his fall / and should
if he had not synnyd byne of the same innocense and prefection that he was
created in: so were we in his loins when he synnid / and participant of his
sin. And as we were in him and partakers of the i will: so were we in him when
god made him a promese of grace and part takers of the same grace: not as the
children of Adame / but as the chylder of the promise. As the sin of Adame
with out pruylege or exception extentyd / and appertaynyd unto all Adames /
and every of Adames posterite / so did this promis of grace generally
appertain as well to every and singular of Adames postetite as to Adame: as it
is more plainly expressid Gene. 15.17. Where god promisythe to bliss in the
sede of Abraham / all the people of the worold. And Paul makythe no diversity
in Christ / of jew / nor Gentile. Ferther it was never for bid / but that all
sorts of people and of every progeny in the worold to be made part takers of
the jews religion and Ceremonis. farther saint Paul To. 5. Doothe by
collation of Adame and Christ / sin and grace: thus interpretat Gods promise.
And makith not Christ inferior to Adame / nor grace unto sin. If all then
shall be sauid / what is to be said of those that saint Peter spekith of 2.
Pet. 2. that shall perish for there false doctrine. And (...) wyce Christ
says / that the gate is streighte that ledythe to live / and feu enter:
Matthew. 7. Thus the scripture answerithe: that the promese of grace
apperteynithe unto every sort of men in the worold / and comprehendithe them
all / how be it within certain limetes / and bonds: the which if men neglect
/ or pass over / they exclude them selfs from the promise in Christ. As Chain
was no more excludid till he excludid himself / then Abel: Saul then David:
Judas then Peter: Esau / then Jacob: thowgh Mala. 1. To. 9. it semithe that the
sentence of God was yeuen to saw the one / and to damn the other / before
the one louid God / or the other hatid God. How be it these threteninges of God
against Esau if he had not of his wilful malice excludid himself / from the
promise of grace / should no more have hindrid his salvation / then Gods
threteninges against Niniue Ion. 1. which not withstonding that God said
should be destroiede within xl. days stood agreat time after / and did penence.
Esau was circumcisyd / and presentid unto the churge of God by his father Isaac
in all external Ceremonies / as well as Jacob. And that his liefe and
conversation was not as agreeable unto justice and equite / as Iacobes: the
sentence of God unto Rebeka Gene. 25. was not in the fault / but his one
malice: for there is mencionid nothing at all in that place Gene. 25. that Esau
was disheretyd of eternal liffe but that he should be inferioure unto his
brother Jacob in this worold which prophecye was fulfyllid in there posterites
/ and not in the persons them selfs. Of this acceptance of the one / and
reprobation of the other conserning the promesis of the Earth spekithe Malachie
the prophet / as the beginning of his book declarith speaking in this wice. I
have louid you says the lord / and ye say: wherein have thou louid us? God
answerithe. Was not Esau / Iacobes brother says the lord? Not withstonding I
louid Jacob and hatid Esau. Wherein hatid god Esau? the prophet shewithe. I
have made his possession that was the mountes (seir) desolate / as a desert or
wyldernys of dragones / Malachie 1. the which happenid in the time of
Nabuchodonosor. Wherein he louyd Jacob the text declarithe. God transferryd the
right and title that appertaynid unto Esau the elder brother to Jacob the
younger. like wice the lo^d that was promisid unto Abraham and Isaac / was by
legacy and Testament / yeue^ unto Jacob and his posterites / Gene. 25. an 27.
Saint Paul Romans 9. vsithe this example of Jacob and Esau for none other
purpose but to take away from the Jews / the thing that they most putt here
trust in. to say / the vain hope they had in the carnal linaige / and
natural descent from the family and houshol of Abraham. and likewice there
false confidence they had in te keeping of the law of Moses. Paul's hole purpose
is in that Epistole / to bring man unto a knolege of his sin / and to show
him how it may be remittid: and with many testimonis and Examples of the
scripture / he prouithe man to be sauid only by mercy / for the Merits of
Christ. Which is apprehendid and receuid by faith: as he at large shewithe
cap. 3.4.5. of the same Epistole.

In the understanding of the which three Chapiters aryght / is requyryd a
singular and exact diligence: for it semythe by those places that paul
concludythe / and in manner includythe the dyuyne grace / and promys of God
within certain terms and lymytes / that only Christ schuld be effycacyous and
profetable in those / that apprehend and receive this abundant grace by
faith: and to souche as has not the use of faith / Christ / nether gods
grace to appertain. Now seeing no man by reason of this Natural incredulyte
born / and begoten with us Romans 11. Gal. 3. can belyue and put souche
confydence in God as he requyrythe by his Law / as experience of our own
wekenis declarithe / thowghe man have yers and time to belyue / the promise of
God in christ appertaynythe unto noman. This Sentence is plain Mark the last
chapter. He that belyuythe not / schalbe da^nid. How be it we know by the
scripture / that not with stonding this imperfection of faith / many shall be
sauyd / and likewyce / not with stondyng that Gods promise be general unto all
people of the worold / Mat. 11. Romans 11. 1. Tim. 2. Gene. 3. yet many shall be
damnyd. These too points therefore must be diligently discussyd. first how
this faith / being vnperfeit / is acceptid of god: the^ how we be excludyd
from the promise of grace / that extendithe to all men.

I will not rehearse now the minds of other / but as briuely and simple as I
can / declare the mind of the scripture in this matter. Saint Paul callithe
this servitude of sin / naturali remaining in our nature corruptid /
somtymes apethian / then amartian / at an othere time asthenean. The first word
signifiythe an impersuasibilite / diffidence / incredulite / contumatie or
inobedience. The second signifiythe Error / sin or decete. The Third
betokenithe wekenes / imbecillyte / or imperfection. so wrytithe Paul. 1. Cor.
15. mannis body to be first borne in imperfection / or imbecillite. Also that
God concludithe allmen under infidelite. To. 11. In the Epistole to the
Galathiens capit. 3. He says that the scripture doothe conclude all men under
sin. in those three places thou may se the three words that I rehersid
before with the which Paul describithe the infirmites of man. which
infirmites / Esai 53. Io. 1 Soothe testify that they are translatid into
Christ. Not so that we should be clean deliuerid from them / as thowghe they
were ded in our nature / or our nature / changid or should not provoke us oni
more to i will: but that they should not damn us / because Christ satisfied for
the^ in his own body. And Paul says. Romans 5. that Christ died for sinners
which were infirm: and callithe those sinners thennimies of God. how beyt /
he callythe not them Theostygas in the scripture / that is to say co^temnours
of God. Every man is callid in the scripture wickid / and thennimie of God /
for the privation and lack of faith / an love / that he owithe unto God. Et
impij uocantur qui no^ omnino sunt pij. that is to say / they are callid wickid
that in all things honorithe not god / beliuithe not in God / and obseruithe
his commandments as they should do / which we cannot do / by reason of this
natural infirmite / or hatred of the flesh (as Paul Callithe it To. 8.)
against God. In this sense takithe Paul this word wickid / Romans 5. when he
says that Christ died for the wickid. So must we interpretat saint Paul and
take his words / Or else noman should be damnid. Now we know that Paul him
self / Saint John / and Christ / damnythe the contemprours of God / or souche
as willinglij cotinew in sin / and will not repent. Ma. 12. Mar. 3. Luce 12.
Paul Romans 8.1. Corint. 5.2. Co. 6.2. Pe. 1. Those the scripture excludithe
from the general promis of grace. Thou seist by the places before rehersid
that thowghe we can not belyue in God as vndourttidly as is requirid / by
reason of this our natural sickenis / and diseace: yet for Christ's sake / in
the judgment of God / we are acco^ptid as faithful fydeles for whoys sake this
natural dyseace and syckenys is pardonyd by what name so ever Saint Paul
callithe these natural infirmite / or Original sin in man / And this
imperfection or natural sickenis taken of Adame / excludithe not the person
feom the promis of God in Christ / except we transgress the limimites / and
bounds of this Oryginall sin / by our own folly / and malice / and either
of a contempt / or hate of Gods word we fall into sin / and transform our
selfs into the ymaige of the devil. Then we exclude by this means our
selfs from the promises and merits of Christ / who only receuid our
infirmites / and Original diseace: and not the contempt of him / and his law.
farther the promise appertain to souche as repent. Therefore Esai Capit. 53.
said without excepcion / that the infirmites of all men were cast upon his
Blessid shulders It is our office therefore to se / we exclude not oureselfes
from te general grace / promisyd to all men. It is not a Chrystiane man's
part to attribute his salvation to his own frewill / with the pelagion / and
extenuat original sin. Nor to make God thauctor of i will / and our damnation
/ with the Maniche. Nor yet to say / God has wrote^ fatal Laws as the
Stoicke and with necessite of desteny / uiolently pullithe one by the here in
to heaven / and thrustithe the other hedling into hell. But assertaine thy self
by the scripture / what be the causes of reprobation / and what of Election.
The cause of reiection / or damnation is sin in man / which will not hire /
nether receive / the promise of the gospelle: or else after he has receauid it
/ by accustomid doing of i will / he fall either in a contempt of the gospel /
will not study to live there after / or else hatiht the gospel because it
condemnithe his ungodly liefe. And would therwere nether God / not gospel to
punish him for doing of i will. This sentence is true how so ever man judge of
predestination. God is not the cause of sin / nor would not have man to sin
/ Psalm. 5. Non Deus uolens iniquitatem, tu es. That is to say. thou art not
the God that willyt he sin. Osee. 13. it is said: Thy perdicion o Israel is
of thy self: and thy succur only of me. The cause of our election is the
mercy of God in Christ / To. 9. How be it / he that will be part taker of this
election / must receive the promise in Christ by faith: for therefore we be
electid: because afterward we are made the members of Christ: Ephe. 1. Romans 8.
Therefore as in the justification / or remission of sin / there is a cause /
towghe no dignite at all / in the receauer of his justification: even so we
judge him by the scripture / to be justified / and has remission of his sin
/ because he receauid the grace promisid in Christ. So we judge of election /
by the event / or success / that happenithe in the liffe of man: those only to
be electid / that by faith / apprehend / the mercy promisid in Christ. other
wice we should not judge of election. for Paul says plainlye To. 8. that they
that be led by the sprit of God / ar the children of God / and that the sprit
of God does testifye with our sprites / that we are the children of God.
being admonishyd by the scripture / we must leave sin / and do the works
commaundid of God / or else it is a carnal opinion / that we have blindid
oureselfes with all of fatal desteny and will not saw us. and in case there
follow not our knolege of Christ / amendment of liffe: it is not lively
faith that we have / but rather a vain knolege and mere presumpsion. Io. 6.
says Noman commithe unto me except my father draw him? many men understand
these words in a wrong sense / as thowghe God requirid in a reasonable man /
no more then in a ded post. and markithe not the words that follow. Omnis qui
audit a patre and discit, uenit ad me. That is to say. every man that hirithe /
and lernithe of my father / cumnithe to me. God drawithe with his word and the
holy ghost: but ma^nis dewty is to hire and learn. that is to say / receive the
grace offered / consent unto the promise / and not repugne the God / that
callith. God does promise the holy ghost / unto them that ask him / and not
to them that contemn him. We have the scripture daily in our hands / read
it / and hire it preachid / Gods mercy ever co^tineu the same. let us think
verily that now God callithe / and convert our liefes to it. let us obey it /
and beware / we suffer not our folyshe judgments to wander after the flesh /
lest the devil wrappe us in darkenis / and teach us to seek the election of
God / out of the scripture. all thowghe we be of our sealfes bound men unto
sin / and can do no godd / by reason our original / and race / is vicious:
yet has not the devil inducid holy / his similitude into any of Adames
posterite / but only into those / that contemn / and of a set porpose / and
destenyd malice / hate God. as Pha^ao / and Saul. The One gatherid all his men of
war / and would fight with God / and his church / rather then obey his
commandment. the other would / against Gods exprece will / and pleasure / kill
David / that God had ordainid to be king. These sins Christ callithe the
sin against the holy ghost / Matt. 12. Mar. 3. Lu. 12. saint Joan. 1. Joan.
5. Sin unto death. Saint Paul Ebre. 10. voluntary / or willing sin. We
must therefore Judge by the scripture / and belyue all things there spoken.
Know there by / the willl of God / and sarche not to know the thing / that
appertainithe nothing to thine office. Remember how craustie a workma^ the
devil is / and what practice he has vsyd with other. Cher^ely and before
all things / he goithe about to take this persuation / that Gods word is true
/ out of man's heart. As he did with Adame / Gene. 3. that thowght nothing
less then to die as God said. then thowght he holy to have printyd his own
ymaige in Adame / for the ymaige of god. an to bring hime to an utter contempt
/ and hatred of God for ever / as he had browght him to a diffidence / and dout
of his word. Here let us all take heed of our selfs / that dalye with the
word of God / being admonyshyd of isle / yet amend not. We shall find at lenghe
/ God to be just in his word / and will punish with eternal fire our
contumacie / and inobedience / which fire / shall be no less hot / then his
word speakythe of. So did he with Saul. Perswadyd the miserable wreche / that
God was so godd / that thowghe he offendyd he would not punish him as he said
/ but be pleacyd with a fat sacrifice again: 1. Reg. 15. This doctrine is
therefore necessary to be knowin of all men: that God is just and true / and
requirithe of us fere / and obedience: as Saint Johan says he that send me
is true. David Psalm. 145. spekith thus of his justice. The lord is just in all
his ways. And understand / that his justice extendithe to too diverse ends.
The One is / that he would all men to be sauyd / Gene. 3.15.17. Matthew. 11. Isai.
53.1. Timo. 2. To. 11. The other end / to give every man according to his acts.

To obtain the first end of his justice / as many as benot utterly wicked /
and may be help: partlye with thretenynges / partly with promises / he
alurythe / and prouokythe them unto amendment of liffe. The other part of his
justice / rewardithe the obedience of the godd / and punishith thin obedience /
and contempt of the i will. These too justice the elders call correctiuam. an
retributiuam. Jonas the Prophet spekythe of the first cap. 2. And Christ Mat.
25. of the second. God would / all men to be sauyd / and therefore prouokithe /
now be fere menes / now be foul / that the sinner / should satisfy his just /
and rightous pleasure. not that the promises of god pertain unto souche as
will not repent / or his thretenynges to him that doothe repent. but those
means he vsithe to save his pour creature / 1. Co. 11. this ways vsithe he
to Nurtur us until souche time as his holy sprit / work souche a perfection i^
us / that we will obey him / thowghe there were no pain / nor Joy mencyonatyd
of at all. therefore look not only / upon the promise of god / but also / what
diligence and obedience he requirithe of the / lest thou exclude thy self
from the promese. There was promisid unto all those that departid out of Egypt
with Moses / the land of Canaa^: how be it / for disobedience of Gods
commandments / there was but one / or too that entryd. Of the other part /
thou seist that the menaces / and Horrible thretenynges of God / that Niniue
the great cite should be destroyed within xl. days / nothing appertainid unto
the Ninevites / be cause they did penance / and returnid to God. In them /
seyst thou christian reader the mercy of God / and general promise of
salvation performid in Christ / for whoys sake only / God / and man was set a
one. So that they receauyd the preaching of the Prophet / and took God for
there God / and God took them to be his people. and for a certainte there of /
reuokid his sentence / that gave them but xl. days of liefe. They likewyce
promisyd obedience unto his holy Laws / and commandments / as God give us
all grace to do / That thowghe we be infirm / and weacke to all ^ertewes / we
exclude not our selfs / by contempt / or negligence from the grace / promisid
to all men. Thus fare well in Christ. 5. Nouembris Anno M. D. XLIX.

A Declaration of the then commandments.
Caput I. What the laws is.
Seeing that the least part of the scripture requirithe i^ the writer boothe
judgment / an circu^spection / that the interpretacion of one place / repung
not the text of gods word / in an other place: How mouche more diligence /
circumspection / fere / and love / requirythe the too tableis of the ten
commandments / in the which is conteinid theffect / and hole sum of all
the scripture. And what so over is said / or wroten by the Prophets / Christ
/ or the Aposteles / it is none other thing / but the interpretacion / and
exposition / of these ten words / or ten commandments. So that it were no
need at all / to require the mind of any Doctor / or expositour to know the
will / and pleasure of God / manifestid unto the worold in his word / would
they that has leisure to read the scripture / study therein themselfes. Or
souche as be appointid / to the ministry of the church / in there sermones
declared / unto the vnlernyd what / and which commandment / the Evangelist /
Prophet / or History that he prechith / declarithe. If this were done: then
were it no need / to bestow so many yers in reding the gloss / and
interpretation of man. For let him writ / or say / what he pleasithe: he that
vnderstondithe the text / shall be allwaies able / to judge / whether he writ
true or false. and so stablyshe his faith / and knolege / upon the word of
God: and not upon the interpretacion of man. conform all his liffe to this
rule and canone of the ten commandments / and not unto the decrees of man /
as God commandithe Deuteronomy. 4. These ten words / has been largely / and at
lenghe wroten upon / by many great / and famous Clerks. So not withstonding as
they have yet lefft sufficient matter unto there successors / where upon they
may exercise / both there lerning / and eloquence / as in a thing most
inscrutable. There is no acuite / nor excellency of wit / no lernyng / no
eloquence / that can comprehend / or compass the doctrine / and mystery of
the lerning / that is conteinid in these commandments. They teach
abundantly / and sufficiently / in few words / how to know God / to follow
vertew / and to com to eternal life. Wherefore it behouythe every man of God /
to know as perfetelie these commandments / as he knowithe his own name.
That all his works / words / and towghtes may be gouernid according unto the
mind / and pleasure of this law. like wice be cause we may / by the knolege
here of / vndrestond other me^nis writings / and commandments / whether
they be of God / or of man / profetable / or pernicious: ledi^g to liffe
eternal / or to death everlasting. They reach what God requirithe in the
heart / and what in external conversation / boothe to God / and man: what is to
be down in the co^moune wealth / and what in every private cause. What is the
superioures deutie / and what the inferioures: What the housbou^des deutie /
and what the wiefes: what the fathers / and what the sons: what to be down
to a citicene / or lands man / and what to a stranger: what in the time of
peace / and what in the time of war. So that in these ten precepts / every
man may se what his office is to do: without farther travel or study / ^n any
other sort of othere lerning. I purpose therefore by Gods grace / as well as I
can / to open by other places of the scripture / the true sense / and meaning
of these ten cmmmaundementes / simple / and plainly / that the vnlernyd / may
take proof te by the same. This order I will observe.

First show what this word law / or commandment meanythe.

Then how the law should be vsyd.

Thyrdely / prepare the Readers mind / that he may always read / and hyre /
these commandments with fruit / and commodite.

Forthelye interpretat every commandment severally / that the Reader may
perceive / what god the yeuer of the law requirithe of every man / that
professithe his name.

Justinian. lib. 1. pandect. tit. 1. says that the law is a faculty / or
scie^s of the thing tat is god and right / as celsus there definithe. Or thus
the law is a certain rule / or canon / to do well by / which awght to be
known / and kept of all men. Cice. de leg. says / that the law / is a
certain rule / proceeding from the mind of God / perswadyng right / and
forbydding wrong.

So that the law / is a certain rule / a directorie showing what is godd / and
what is i will: what is vertew / and what is vice / what profetable / and what
disprofetable: what to be down / and what to be lefft vndoune. This
declaration of the law general / apperteinithe unto all the kinds / me^bres /
and particular lowes / made other for the body / either for the soul. So that
who so ever be ignorant of the law / and rules that apertaine unto the sciens /
or art / that he professithe can never com to thend / or perfection / that his
profession requirithe. As for example. thend of a Christian man is eternal
liefe / and his profession is / to know / and learn the law and canones / that
most plainly / and sincerlie / ledithe him unto this end / of eternal
felicite. As the law of God / which is a certain doctrine / showing what we
should be / what we should do / and what leave undone. requiring perfet
obedience toward God / and aduertising us / that God is anger / and
displeafid with sin / and will punish eternally / souche as perform not
all things perfetlie / co^teinid in this law. as ye may read Mat. 22. Exodus
20. Deu. 6. Those places / show that God requirithe of us / perfect obedience.
What pain is dew / to the stransgressour / ye may read / Deuteronomy. 28. Cursid be
he that fulfillith not the law. and like wisse / Mat. 24. Depart from me ye
workers of iniquite / into eternal fire. I declare now / good reader / what
the law is / and not how it may be fulfillid. that I defer unto thend of
thexposition / of the law. Howbe it I would thou shuldes most diligently mark
this diffinicio^ / or declaration / what gods law is that thou may kno /
what differe^s is between the law of God / and the law of man. Man's laws /
only requirithe external / and civil obedience. Gods laws boothe external
/ and internal.

Now he that is ignorant / of themeanis / is ignorant of thend. Benig
ignorarunt of the causes / must needs be ignorant of theffect. Only by the
law of God / the means is known / therefore only the law of God if we will
com to thend that God would us to do: is diligently to be lernyd. For like as
the physician / cannot communicate his health with the sick patient: or the
living man his liese / with the ded body of an other (but every man enyoythe
his own health / and lyuithe with his own liefe) so profetithe not / him
that is vnlernyd / the knolege of an other man. but every man must know / and
lern himself / the law of God / if he will be sauyd / Io. 6. Deuteronomy. 4. As he that
will be a phisicio^ / must lern the precepts / that teachith physic. A musitio^
/ the rules of music / the orator / the rules of Rethorick. The plowgh man /
the rules of husboundre: and so every person the rules that belong unto his
profession / or else he shall never profet in his sciens / or art: nor be
accomptid a craustes man / that knowith not the principles / of his crauffte.
No More / before the majesty of god / is he acco^ptid a christian man / that
perfetlie knowith not the commandments of God / thowghe he be christenid /
and braggithe of the Name / never so mouche. And because that no man should
excuse his ignorance / and says Bible is to long / and conteynithe so high
misteris / and secreates / that the laboring man / has nether sufficient tine
/ nether convenient vndrestonding / to lern the law / and commandments of
God: it pleacid his infinite goddenis / to collect / and gather the contents /
and somne of the whole law / into so short / and co^pendious abridgme^t that no
sciens of the worold / has his principles or general rueles / concludid with
so few words. Experience / and prove / declarith the same. The logicion / has
no lece / then Ten general rules / called predicamentes / wherein is conteynid
thole matter of his art. The Rethoricion / three manner / and diverse kinds of
causes / Demonstratiue / Judicial / and deliberatiue. Thole body of the law
Civil / these three principles / live honestly / hurt noman / and give every
man his / Iustinianus / libr. 1. Institu. The physician / as many principles /
as be kinds of diseaces. The heavenly God eternal / has concludyd all the
doctrine Celestial / in ten words / or commandments / Exo. 20. Deu. 5. And
yet / for a farther healpe of our unapt memory / to retain the will of god:
he has gatherid / the said ten commandments / into too / Mat. 22. Mar.
12. Love God with all thy heart: and thy neighbor as thy self / Deuteronomy. 6.26.
Leuit. 19. So that every dull / and hard wittid man / may sooner lern / the
principles / and general rules of Christ's religion / the^ of any other art /
or sciens / if he give his diligence / any thing at all / for the space of one
monethe.

There be many causes / that should provoke man unto the study / and knolege of
this law. First / the profet that Cummith thereof / which is expressid / Joan.
17. This is liffe eternal says Christ / to know the / O father: and him that
thou have sent / Jesus christ. David the prophet / desirid the knolege of this
law / and so copiouslie / expressithe the commodite ther^f / in the most
holy Psalm 118. that nothing of this worold may be comparid to it / for it
ledithe to eternal lieffe. What commodites / it bringithe in this worold / it
is declarid Deuteronomy. 28. et Psalm. 128. if thou hirethe wice of thy lord God / and
observe it / thou shall be blissid in the filled / and at home / blessid in all
things that thou take in hand / to do. read the Chapter. if thou wilt not
learn / the will of thy lord: thou shall be cursid in the feld / and at home:
and unfortunate in all thy acts. farther / without the knolege and obedience
of this law / no person in the worold can justly / and conveniently serve in
his vocation / or condition of liefe / of what degree so ever he be. Wherefore
Moses commaundid / Deuteronomy. 4. that noman should decline / from this law / nether
to the right hand / nether to the leiffte: mening by these words / that noman
should add / or take any thing from it / but simple / to be observe it / as it
is yeuen / and wroten unto us / Ffrom this rigth line / and true regle of
Gods word: man arrith diverse ways. some time by ignorance / because he
knowithe not / or will not know / that only thexpresse word of God sufficithe.
He holdithe with the most part and co^demnithe the beter / as it is to be
seen / at this present day. This reason takithe place: it is alowid of the
most part / and stablishid by so many holy / and lernid bishopes / therefore
it is true. When / they can not by the scripture prove / neither the lerning /
nether the lief of there doctors / to be good.

The second way / that ledith from the word of God / is money times / the pour
/ and authorite of this worold. As we se / by the bishope of Rome. and all his
adherentes / who yeuith more credenc / and faith onto one Charter and gift of
Constantinus / then to all the hole bible. An other errithe / by mistakyng of
the time / making his supersticio^ / far elder then it is / will not for sake
the faulshed for the truithe. An says / thus my father beliuide / and should I
beliue the contrary? thus rather / will give credit to his father being blind
/ then unto God his great grant father / that seith. to the law of man more
credit / then to the law of God. As the knolege of man is thus with drawn /
from the word of God / be ignorancie / and i will vsid customs / so is the live /
and conversation of man like wice. Not gouernid with the word of god / but
with accustomid fraud / an gile: every man in his uocation / and condition of
lyffe. The spiritualite with false receauid / and i will deseruid / tea this. The
temperaltie / with false co^tractes / and preposterous bying / and sellnig. The
princes / and superior poures of therthe / for the most part / and all lernid
men / other in mayntaining a wrong religion / or in not restoring the true /
decline / far from this simple / and sincere verite conteinyd in gods word.
Some dispense with a less isle / to a voyede a greater harm. Some prescribe
laws / for the conscience of man / for atime / until it may be / farther
deliberatid upon / or approuid godd / by a general counsel. These men /
greuouslie offend the^ selfs / and causith other / to do the same. In case the
law: made for the time / seem not godd / unto souche / as shall at amore
leisure / have thexamination thereof: the law for the mean time / shall be
condemnid / as heretical / and pernicious.

Then put the case / that many / or at the least / some of those that ledd
there conscience / after the law / made for the mean time / dye. How stondithe
then the case / with these departed souls / that were deceuyd / whiles they
liuyd / by false doctrine. They doutles / ar loost / for ever / and without
time / if they dyed / in any error of the Catholice faith / as Crist says
Luce 6. spekyng of false interpretoures / of the word of God. If the blind /
led the blind / he says / not / only he that ledith shall fall into the
dyche: but boothe. Therefore it is not sufficient / that people have a law for
the mean time: but what so ever / the conscience begynnithe with all / it must
end / in the same. That is to say: no law at all should be spoken of consernyng
the conscience / but thonlie word of God / which never alteryd / nor cannot be
alteryd / Matt. 5. Luce 16. Psalm. 18. Dauyd Psalmo 119. prouithe the
immutabilite of Gods word / by too strong reasones. if heuens / and Earth
made by thy word can not be alteryd / how mouche more the word it self? Read
the too verses that begin with the letter lamed. in Englisse thus. Thy word
lord abidithe for ever / as the heavens testifye. Unto the whithe law / the
conscie^s of man / in matters of faith / is bound only. for when so ever / or
who so ever prescribythe any law / for the cause of religion / and yeuith it
this title / for the mean time / until it may be iudgyd by a general
counsel / or other wyce decreyde / by thassemblaunce of lernyd men: thauctor
of the law / declarithe hime self / not to know / whether his law be true / or
false / leding to hell / or to heaven / to save the conscience of man or to
da^ne it: but leuith it in dowt / and makith it as uncertain / as these that
shall have the ce^sure / and judgment thereof / preferrid unto there discretion
and lerning. I would wish therefore / and hartel^ pray unto almightye God / to
put into the hearts of all superior poures of the Earth / grace / and knolege /
to chose 4. indifferent judges / to apeace all contrauerses in religion. If the
Clergy should judge / the worold would / and might say / they are to partial.
and for many respects / would to mouche favor / there own co^modite. If the
Temperalty should iugde / the Clerge would think / some thing to be down of
displeasure / or malice / that allwaies in manner / has remainid between the
parts. Farther if Apapist / Lutherion / or Zuinglion should judge: they agree /
so i will / one with the other / that the matter could not want suspicion. Therefore I
would have / ons these iiij. indifferent judges to break the striffe. The
Bible in Ebreu / the Bible in Greek / the Bible in Latin / and the Bible in
Englisse / or in any other oulger tongue / according to the speech of the Realm
/ where this communicatio^ should be had. Then doutles / these judges that
fauorith not / moreth one part / then the other: no more one person / then the
other: Would sone set men at peace: incase they louyd not dissension. But as
long / as thauctorite of any general counsel / or judgment of man / is
accomptyd equivalent / and egall with the word of God: the truythe / cannot be
sincerely known. Souche as can interpretat / nothing well / but lokithe to
find occation / to calumniat the good meaning of the thing well spoken / will
say I have an i will opinion of God the eternal in heaven / and like wyce of the
superior poures in hearthe / because I damn the disciples of the false
Doctors / with the doctors: and take from all poures of the earth auctorite to
prescribe unto there subjects / any law / touching religion / of the solle. As
consernyng the judgment of God / against those that be seducyd by false
prechers / or makers of false laws / Saint Luce capit. 6. Ezech. 3. et 13.
iudgithe as I do. And as touching the question. What I should then say of our
fore fathers / that ever sith the time of Constantine temperour and Syluester
the Bishope of Rome has allwaies in manner / been seducid by the false docrine
of man: I can judge / none other then / the scripture teachithe. Boothe he that
ledithe unto damnation / and he that is led / fallithe into the pytt. And in
the same place / Christ says / that it sufficithe the disciple / to be as his
master is. Saint Paul describithe the nature of souche as preach false
doctrine thus 2. Tim. 2. they led unto iniquite: and there communication /
eatithe as the diseace of a cankre. Meaning that fall se doctrine / hurtithe not
on lie him / that is seducyd: but like wyce / souche as shall be his hereres. And
as this diseace called a canker / if it be in any part of man's body / it
infectithe allwaies the next parts unto it as Galenus writithe de causis
morborum: like wice Leonhardus Fuchsius, De compendio medicinae. And Ouidius
thus. Vtque malum late solet, immedicabile cancer serpere, and illaesas vitia
it is addere parts: which is the same description of the diseace wroten before /
so does false doctrine. And as every membre of man / may be in danger of this
diseace / yet chefflie the members that wantithe syneues / and bones. ut
foeminarum mammae, quod rarae and laxae sint. ac crassissima^ atrae bilis
materiam prompte excipiant.

Even so the preaching of false doctrine / may deceive every man but specially
the simple and on lernid / as it is to be seen at this day / the more petie
every where. Easier for a soul / that can do nothing / but bliss a tubbbe of
water / to keep and hundrethe in supersticion / and the adulterous doctrine of
man: the^ for him that is well lernyd in the law of God / to win ten unto
Christ. Not withstonding I beliue / that in the mids of darkness / when all
the worold (as far as man might judge) had sworen unto the Bishope of Rome /
that Christ had his electes / that never consentyd unto his false laws /
nether walked not / after strong Gods. thowghe unknown unto man / as it was
in the time of Elie the Prophet / 3. Reg. 19. where God saiede / he had
preseruyd seven thousand that never bowyd there kneis / nor kyssyd Baal.

In every aige / so god preseruithe sum / that ^o false doctrine may corrupt
them: thowghe ^e nature thereof be / as Paul says / to infect ^s a canker. so
God impechithe many times / and would not things to execute there natural
ope^ation / as we read Exo. 3. where the bowshe bur^d / and yet consumid not.
like wice of the three ^ildre^ in the fiery furnis / Dan. 3. and as Christ ^ithe
/ Io. 10. that his sheep harkenid not / unto ^e voice of the false preachers.
As many therfo^ / ad died before us / seducid by false prea^ers without
penance / the scripture condemni^e. As many as beliuid the^ not / but trustyd
to ^e scripture (or else deceauid / yet callid to grace ^fore they died) live
eternally in loy and solace. (...) ar sauid / as John says / Apo. 13. in the
blud the lamb. I judge therefore in this point / god (...) be no more severe /
the^ the scripture teachithe / ^heri^ he teachithe us / what we should beliue:
and ^dge of him. Thus I have spoken largely / and ^ewly / to admonyshe my godd
reader / to bewa^ of man's laws: in the cause of religion. As ^^ching the
superior poures of therthe / it is ^t unknown unto all them that has ^eden /
^d markid the scripture / that it apertainithe ^thing / unto there office / to
make any law / to ^^ern the co^scie^s of there subjects / in religion. (...)
to reign over the^ in this case / as the word God co^maundethe / Deu. 17.1.
Re. 12.2 Par. Sap. 6.

How be it in there Realms / provinces / and jurisdictions / they may make
what laws they will / and as many as they will. Command them to be kept as
long as it pleasith them / and change them at there pleasure / as they shall
se occation for the wealth / and commodite of there Realms* as we se in all
the notable commune wealths. Among the Greakes / and Romans with other. Unto
the which superior poures: we owe all obedience / boothe of body / and gods
/ and likewice our daily prayer for them unto almighty God / to preserve
there honors / in grace / and quietnis: To. 13.1. Tim. 2. 1. Pet. 2. Mat. 22.
Mar. 12. Luc. 20. and as many diverse commune wealths as there be / so many
diuerses laws may there be. How be it / all Christenid kings / and kingdoms
with other magistrates / should reign by one law / and govern the churges of
there Realms / solie by the word of God / which is never to be chaungyd / as
I declared before in the diffinitio^ of Gods law. that it is a rule never to be
chaungyd / by superior pour / or inferior: Psalm. 18. et 1^8.. so doothe the
holy Prophet David (that honorid God / reuerencid the poures of therthe /
louid the commune sort of people) teach / Psalm. 27. Show me God lor thy way /
and led me in aright pathe / for fere of those that lay wayghte / for me. so
commau^dithe / Job ca. 22. to lern the law at the mouche of God.

I follow therefore the coo^maundeme^t of god / persuading every man to lern his
faith in his law as Moses did / Deu 31. commending the law unto the pristes
/ the sons of leui. Not only that they should know it / but to show it unto
thole multitude of the people: men / women / children / and strangers that they
might hire it / lern it / fere the lord God / and observe his commandments.
So Christ commaundid his Apostelles to preach / and there audiens to hyre /
the thing he commanded / Mat. 28. Mar. 16. with what diligence / and how it
should be preachid / lern in the 8. and 9. chapter of Neemi.

Caput II. Of the use of the law.
IT is well known by the places before rehersid / that the law of God
requirithe an inward / and perfete obedience / unto the will of God / the
which this nature of man corruptyd by Original sin cannot perform / as
saint Paul prouithe manifestlye in the 7. an 8. chapter to the Romans.
There remainithe in man as long as he liuithe ignorance / and blindenis / that
he knowith not god / nor his law as he awghe to do. But rebellythe by contumace
against God. For noman suffrith Gods visitatious / and punishments / with
souche pacien^ as is requirid. Noman can abide to hire his defaultes rebukyd by
the law / but hatithe his admonitours / and would that there were nether God /
nether law so that he might vnpunishyd satisfye his pleasure. Like wyce the
will as frawarde / and perverse that it willith nothing of God / ner of his law
/ if it demynyshe any part of souche gods / or pleasure / as the worold
requirithe / as we may se / by daily defection / and departure from the knolege
of Gods word / in those that ons were as ardent as fire. But now as the
Gadarenes did / Matthew. 8. Luce 8. Marc. 5. They desire Christ do depart out of
there country / rather then they would loost there swyne. Where is now the will
/ that freely and Franklye should for sake all the gods of the worold / and
also this mortal liffe / rather then to leave Jesus Christ / which as Johan
says / only has the word of eternal live cap. 6. it is not need to prove
this peruersnys and wicked resistance against God and vertew by thexample of
othere: but every man may find himself to mouche infectyd with this diseace /
would he look upon his own liefe / and be as egall a judge of him self / as
he is temerous in judging of other. Then should he file the same i will in himself
/ that he seithe in an other and every man damnyd before God / except souche as
belyue in Jesus Christ / Romans 5. And study to live after his law / 2. Cor. 5.
Lu. 1. Tit. 1. Matt. 7. Psalm. 6.

Seeing the works of the law cannot deserve remission of sin / nor saw man /
and yet God requyrythe our diligens / and obedionce unto the Law: it is
necessary to know the use of the law / and why it is yeuen us.

The first use is civil / and external / for byddyng / and punyshyng the
transgression of polytike / and civil ordinance / as Paul wrytythe. ^.
Timoth. 1. The law is yeuen to the unjust. Wherefore God commaundythe the
Magistrates and superior poures of the Earth to punish the transgressors of
the law made for the preservation of every commune wealth / as we read / Deuteronomy.
19. thou shall remove the i will / down in the commune wealth / that other may
fere to do the same. Thou shall have no pytye upon the transgressoure. for
souche petye as is vsyd of man against this commandment toward the
transgressors: is rather amayntenaunce of i will then works of mercy.

The second use of the law is / to inform and instruct man aright what sin
is / to acuse us / to fere us / and to damn us and our justice / because we
perform not the law as it is requiryd / Romans 1. et 7. howbe it the law
concludithe all men under sin / not to damn them but to saw them / if they
comme to Christ / Romans 11. Gala. 3.

These too uses of the law / appartayne as well unto the infideles / as to the
fideles. To souche as be not regeneratyd / as to those that be regeneratid: for
those that she cannot bring to Christ / she damnythe.

The third use of the law is / to show unto the Christians what works God
requirythe of them: For he would not that we should feign works of our own
brains to serve him with all: as the Bishops laws that teachithe an othere
faith / and other works then the old Testament or the new. but requirythe us
to do the works commaundyd by him / as it is wroten / Matt. 15. they worshipp
me in vain with the precepts of men. Therefore David says: thy word lord
God is the light unto my fette / Psalm. 119. By the knolege of this law / we
judge all other me^nes writings / Christianes / and Ethnyches / wether they
writ well / or isle. And with out a right knolege in this law / no doctrine
ca^ be known whether it be true / or false.

This law iudgithe / who defendid the better part / Marcion / or Tertullio^:
Augustine / or Arrius / Christ and his Apostelles / or Caiphas / and his colege
of scribes and pharisees: the pour preachers that with danger of liefe set
forth the glory of God / or the Pope with his colege of Cardinales: that with
wyckid laws / study to deface the glory / and majesty of Christ's church.
where and what is the Catholic church of the chrystians: and where the
Synagoge of Antechrist. No falshede can be hydd / if men syke the truythe with
this light. If we examyne our deades / or other men's by this law or Canon:
we shall soon perceive / whether they pleace God / or displeace. If we be
preasyd / and have an honest estimation among people: bring boothe our
conscience / and preace of the worold / unto this rule of Gods word: and then
shall every man judge himself / whether he be inwardely the same man: that
people esteem him for vttwardlie. Incase man / sustain like wyce dispreace /
and contempt / of souche as be in the worold / if the law of God bare testimony
with his conscience / that it is rather the Malice of the worold / then his
demerites / that oppressith thus his godd fame with the burden of slander: he
shall rather reyoyce / that God has preseruyd him from the crimes that he is
falsely accusyd of / then impatiently souffre the malicious worold / maly /
cyouslie to judge good / to be i will / as it is his accustonyd manner.

This law iudgithe that Aristotell in his morales teachithe better doctrine
when he co^demnithe thexternalle fact incase the mind and will concur not to
the doing thereof: then the Bishops in there decreis that attribute the
remission / of sin nether to contrition / ner faith / nether to Christ / but
unto thexternall sprynglyng of a drop of water. for thus they say of the
water / and of trebred. in the exorcisme / or coniuration of the water: Fias
aqua exorcizata ad effugandam omnem potestatem inimici etc. That is to say. I
conjure the: in the name of God / as it is at the beginning of the coniuration
/ to be a water blessed / to expel all the pour of the devil. Of the bread
thus: Benedic domine istam creaturam panis, ut omnes gustantes ex eo, tam
corporis, quam animae recipiant sanitatem. That is to say: Bliss lord this
bread that as many as taste thereof / may receive health / boothe of body /
and solle. By this law thou may judge who defendithe the better opinion. Numa
Pomp that for bid images: or else the Bishops laws / that say Idols can
teach the vnlernyd people / and be / to be vsyd. Bring the matter to judgment /
and se which opinion Gods law will defend: Non facies, inquit Deus,
sculptile, aut ullam similitudinem. Thou shall make no ymaige etc. Who is law
is more consonant with Gods laws / the decrees / and precepts of Cato /
that says: Parents ama, Magistratum metue. That is to say love thy father /
and fere the Magistrate: or the Bishopes laws that park young children in
Cloisters that never know there parents need / and like wyce exempt the clerge
from all obedience of the higher poures

Gods laws says with Cato: Honora parents. Omnis anima potestatibus
supereminen tibus subdita sit, Roman. 13. Exodus 20. that is to say / Honor thy
father: and every man be subject unto the superior poures. The Romans
Reprehendid and deposyd like wyce the tyranne / Nero for his crueltye: and
kyllyd the vicious Prince Tarquinius Sextus for vitiating of the chaste Matrone
Lucretia. the Bishopes laws says thus. Si Papa suae, and fraternae salutis
negligens deprehenditur, inutilis, and remissus in suis operibus, and insuper ^
bono taciturnus, quod magis officit sibi, and omnibus, nihilo minus
innumerabiles populos cateruatim secu^ducat primo mancipio gehennae, cum ipso
plagis multis inaeternu^ uapulaturus. Huius culpas isthic redarguere praesumit
mortaliu^ nullus, quia cunctos iudicaturus, ipse a nemine iudicandus. That is
to say / If the Pope care nether fore his own health / nether for his
brothers / befound vnprofetable and negligent in his works / farther aman apt
to do no godd (so I English: tacitur^us a^ bono.i. qui sua natura oi^
honestate, probitateque facile tacet) that hurtythe himself and other: ledythe
with him / people innumerable / by legions unto the devil / to be punyshid
with him / in pains / most dolorous for ever being Pope no mortal man should
presume to reprehend his faults / for he iudgithe all men / and is to be
iudgid of Noman. What law was there ever wroten more pernicious / or contrary
unto Gods laws / then this. Syrillus against Iulianum alegithe the wrytinges
of the philoyopher Pythagoras: who prouyth to be one only God / who made / and
preseruithe only / the things made: so doothe Sophocles: Cicero 2. lib. of the
Nature of Gods. 1. lib. Tuscul. quest. 1. lib. Delegibus Seneca Unto Lucilius
Epist. lib. 15. Bring these Ethnickes laws unto the word of God / with the
law of Bishopes that teachithe the invocation and aid of saints departed
out of this worold: and then thou shall se / that the Ethnickes laws / ar
aprouid by Gods word: and the Bishopes laws condemnyd. For Gods laws says
/ I am the lord thy God / and thou shall have no more / before my face Exodus
20. Deutt 5. and if we pray for any thing / Gods word commaundith to ask in
christ's name. Io. 14. Seeing the knolege / and use of Gods word / is so
necessary / and only tellithe us / what is godd / and what is i will: what true /
and what false: Every man should give diligente to know it: Setting all other
busynis of the worold apart.

Caput III. A preparation unto the Ten commandments.
MOses before he repetithe the Ten commandments in the book of deuteronomy.
Prescribythe certain necessary rules / and instructions / which he vsythe as
preparatyues / and meanys / to dispose and make apt the hearts of the people /
to receue this holy / and most blyssyd sermon of all mighty God / the Ten
commandments / with conding honor / and reverence. and that this law / and
precepts might work there operation / and vertew in manne / which is to
purge / and cleanse the solle / and mind / from all unwholesome / and contagyous
diseace / and fyckenis of sin. And to preserve the body in health / and all
honestye o^ lyffe.

As Apurgation made for the body (whithe Galenus callithe humorum qui sua
qualitate molestant, euacuationem. That is to say a clensing of souche humors /
as be hurfull) many times workithe not his operation / by reason of the i will
temperature of the body / or else of the region / that to mouche / by reason
of het / draw^ the humors of man / into texteriour parts of the body so the
word of God / porid i^to the ears / and understanding of man workythe not mani
times / his operation / inclensing the solle from the humors / and corruption
of sin: by reason of ^hi^e te^perature / and disposition of the persons /
that vsithe to read / and hyre the scripture. As the physician therefore / yeuit
the pacie^t / first some preparatiue to dispose / and make apt the body / to
receive the purgatio^ with fruit / and commodite: so doothe Moses prepare /
first to make his auditors apt to hyre the commandments / that after ward
they might receive the^ with fruit / and profet. How to proceed in the science
/ and practice of physic / lern of Galene and Hippoc. or of souche as
professithe that art. My purpose is / to show how Moses procedithe in the
celestial science of divinity: to cure the solle of man. Heprescribithe unto
his audience 7. rules / or precepts / where with he preparythe them / unto
the receiving of the Ten commandments. and with out them / it auaylithe
nothing / to hyre / or read the commandments / or any other place of the
scripture.

The first rule is: confidence / and Aright perswation of Gods word / that all
his prmeses be true: and willl doutles / give the godd promisid unto the godd /
and the i will promisid unto the i will / towghe it seem / never so impossible unto
the flesh. This preparatiue / is most necessary for all men / that will be
the disciples / and hyrers of Gods word. for when me^ thyncke / that God is
not in dead / as severe / and will punish sin / according as it is wroten
in his commandments: and like wyce favor / and preserve them that fere him
they never take profete / nor never shall do / inhering / or reding the
scripture. for they have no more credence to it / then to a vain and
faythelistale. This misbeliue / and incredulite to words gods word: is
thoccation / and let / that the word hard / or rede^ / workithe not his
operation / and the man no better at night / then in the morning: in a^ge /
the^ in youth. Moses therefore persuadithe the^ unto a certain right
confidence / saing. Ecce dedi in co^spectu uestro terra^, uenite and possidete
terra^, qua^ iurauit dn^s patribus uestris Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ut daret
eis, atque semini eoru^ posteos Deuteronomy 1. That is to sa^ / behold / I have
prese^tid before your face / the la^d which the lord promisid to give unto
^oure fathers Abraham / Isaac / and Jacob / and to there posterite: cu^ and
possess ye / the la^d. Jacob / and his posterite were in souche bo^dayge in
Aegipt / that it sem^d impossible that ever they should possess the lo^d of
Canaan / promisid by God. Read the 14. first chapiters of Exodus and se The^ as
^how can not those / but beliue him to be true in the one promise of his help
/ to wards the godd / so be live him / that he will like wice ponyshe the i will
/ thowghe he suffer / and dissemble for a time at our sin / to call us unto
penance To. 1. yet at lenghe we shall be assurid / he will keep promise as well
in punishing the i will: as in doing godd / to those that repent. If thou read the
scripture: thou shall find examples of boothe how he fauoryd / and kept promise
/ with the godd / and the bad. Noha sauyd / and his famile / the hole worold
damnyd with water: lot sauyd / and the cites burnid. Joshua / and Caleb Entrid
the land promisyd: all the rest dyed for there sin in the desert. If thou
can not read to stablishe thy faith in the word of God / yet can thou lack
no master / to teach the this confydence in God. Torn thine Iye / of which
side thou list. up: or down. Behold the birds of the air / and the flowrs
of the fyld / Mat. 6. Luc. 12* and acknolege / not only the pour of God /
that made them: but also his prouydence / in fedyng / and apparellnig them. for
they be seals / and confyrmations of Gods promisis that will clothe the /
fyde the / and help the / in all necessites. They were not created / only to
be ea / ten / and spellyd unto: but to teach the to credit / and belyue Gods
promises Matthew. 6. Luc. 12.

The second rule / or preparatyue is: that thou have aright opinion / of the
magistrates / and superior poures of therthe / that thou give the^ no more /
nether no lose honor / nor reverence / then the word of God commaundithe. This
he declarithe by the 12. Princes that were sent to explorate / and sarche the
priuites and condition of the land of Canaan / too of the^ perswadid the people
to beliue Gods promise / and not to fere the people / that dwelled in the land.
unto these Godly Princes / was no faith / nor credit yeue^ of the people. The
Princes that perswadid the thing contrary unto God / were beliuid of the people
/ and there counsel admittyd. by this we lern / that souche Magistrates / as
persuade the people by Gods word / should be beliuid and obeide / the other not
/ in the cause of conscience. There / must God only be hard Act. 5. Matt. 10. Or
else people shall fail of a right faith / for he that knowith not / what his
deutye is to God / and his laws: will beliue rather alie with his fore
fathers: then the truithe with the word of God. and this man is no mete
auditour nor disciple of the word of God.

For lack of this preparatiue / the worold / has erryd from the truithe this
many yers / to the dishonor of God / and danger of Chrystiane solles. Men
doothe not look what gods word says / but extollithe the auctorite of
man's laws / preferring the decre of a general / or provincial consell
before the word of God / which has browghte this abomination / and
subversion of all godly doctrine / in to the church of Christ.

The third preparatiue / is obedience: boothe unto God and man. It were as godd
/ never to read the scripture / nor to hyre sermon / incase we mind not to
obey unto the word of God spoken / or reden. Therefore doothe Moses abraide /
and reprehend them / Deu. 1. when they knew the land to be godd / by the fruit
that the 12. princes browght unto them / they would not proceed forth in there
iurney to possess the land / but murmuryd against God / wherefore they peryshyd
in the desert. Therefore / we must bring with us unto the reding of the word of
God / obedience / and be ready to do every thing / it commaundethe / thowghe it
seem never so difficile / As Abraham did in leuing his country / Genes. 12. and
offryng his son / Genesis 22. and as christ commaundith all that will be his
Disciples / Matthew. 10. Luce. 14. the thing that God commaundithe must be obeyed
/ what danger so ever happen. Ye if it be the lost of our lieffe / Luce. 9.17.
Matthew. 16. Like wyce the commandment of the superior poures / and noman
should detract / nether deny his obedience beccuse he is a Christian / 1. Pet.
2. To. 13. Ephe. 6. Col. 3. Tit. 2. not only with Iye service / but from the
heart. sustaining not only souche chargis as the necessites of the common
wealth shall require / but also with liefe / to defend the same / not feri^g
how strong an ennimie is against him / nor how many: but rather to consider /
how strong / God is that has promisid to preserve every man's right / and
yeuen commandment that noma^ shall do the other wrong. Deuteronomy. 5. Exodus 5. Non
facies furtum. commit no thyffe / again: Honora parents. Honor thy father.
The which commandment requirithe obedience to all superior poures. only
obey the word of God / what so ever shall happen unto man / in his godly
vocation as Moses co^mau^dyd / Deuteronomy. 20. if thou see horsemen and cheriotes more
then thou have / fere not god is with the / as we have example in Abraham /
Gedeon / Iosaphat and others.

The fourth preparatiue is / that they should observe / the commune laws vsyd
among all people which is callid ius gentium. that they should peaceable pass
by the possessions of the children of Esau the Mount Seir and like wice by the
Moabitis / not to molest the^ / nether there Gods. but by souche things as
they wantid for money / till they passid there limits / and bonds the which
law bound them / not to spoil / rob / and barn / where so ever they came as
well there friends as there fores / as it is vsyd in our time among
Christianes / that say silent leges inter arma, That i^ to say: laws be
dispensid with all in the time of war. contrary unto this deuillishe opinion /
God requirid them to pass as true men / and not as thyffes / as those that
were obedient unto all honest / and godly laws / and not as exempt and
priuilegyd persons from all vertews / and godlynys.

The fyghithe preparat^^e is / that they should esteem this doctrine of the
commandments as it was worthy. And declared the estimation thereof with money
reasones. The first / of the vtilite / and profete that it bringithe whereof he
spekythe in the 4. cap. Deuteronomy. Haec est sapientia, and intelligentia vestra
coram populo. That is to say / this is your wisdom / and prudence before the
people: this is the doctrine only and law that teachithe how to live well /
and to auaide the displeasur / boothe of god and man / and ledithe to eternal
felicite. what other people is there of the worold / says Moses that has
there gods as present / as our lord God as many times / as we invoke and
call upon him. This doctrine was yeue^ from heaven / and the auctor there of is
God. A doctrine allwaies to be lernid and obseruid: not in Paper / or parshment
/ but in the heart of man. And daily tawghte unto the worold / as the manner of
the yeuyng of it declarithe Exo. 20. unto all the people it was preachyd / not
in an obscure / and dark place: but in the mou^e / cletely and openly that
noman should dout of it / as thowghe it came out of Trophonius cave / saint
Patrice purgatory / or the priuey chamber of the Bishope of Rome. Boothe the
law / and the law yeuer / known of all the people. Minos was familier with
Iubiter / as the Poetis feign. Numa had communication with Aegera the Gods /
but noman was record thereof. He might therfare feyne what he list. As many
superstitious hypocrates has done. There apperyd unto Gregory a child in
the bred of the altar / the which visition if it were true was deuillishe /
and wrowght by the devil to deceive the people of God. Brigitta saw like wyce
in here contemplacions wounders. The Bishops in there decretalles seyth like
wice meruelles and misteris that noman else can se: except he be sworen to
renownce Gods laws. For they teach one faith / and the gospel an other /
one kind of godd works and Christ an other.

This law / is of an other sort / and perfection. Openly manifestyd by God /
not unto one prince or lernyd man / not unto 12. or 70. heddes and principalles
among the people: but unto all the hole congregation / and not suddenly but with
great deliberation / and preparation of the people for the space of three days:
Exodus 19. this law therefore Moses would the pedple to esteem as a thing of all
things most to be estimyd. As they do nothing at all / that say the Scripture
containithe not / all necessary doctrine for the health of man. But nedithe
man's decres.

The sixth preparatiue is a true / and right understanding of the law. Not to
constrayne the letter against the mind of the text / but behold allwaies the
consent of the Scripture / and to do no wrong unto the auctor thereof. Sum men
call this a dispensation of the law: when the extremite thereof cannot with
justice / and equite / be excutyd against the transgressour / as we se Deuteronomy. 4.
where Moses appoyntythe certain Cites / to be as refuges / or sanctuaries for
them / that be chance or against there will should happen to kill any man. The
law is / that who so ever shed the blud of man shall satisfye the law with his
blud again: Gene. 9. Matt. 26. Apoc. 13.

This law extendithe not as far as the words sound: ^ut as far as the mind
of the letter permittithe. that is to say unto souche as of hatred / rash /
and wilful maddenis / or to satisfy an i will and vndigestid passion / that
hatythe his neighbor / killythe his neighbor / co^temnithe God in the
superior powers / who should reuerenche and punish the i will doar / and not he
him self. Those / and souche like / should suffie death again: and not souche
as kyllagaynst there will. Thus doothe the scripture of God interpretat it
self / and shewithe how every law should be understand. The which is a very
necessary rule / and precept / to be all ways obseruyd every where / lest the
rigure / and forse of the letter should do injuries unto any circumstaunce of
the text. therefore I would every man in the r^ding of the Scripture / should
mark too things / in every doutfull text.

First the consent of other places: then the allegory of the letter. as for an
example. This proposition / Matthew. 26. this is my body: first look the other
places of the scripture / what christ's body is / and what qualites it has /
how it was conceauyd and born / and whether it is ascendyd: then thou shall by
the consent of other places / be constrayed to vndrestond these words
according to the analogy / or proporsion of faith / and not after the letter.
then consider by the scripture why Christ by an Allegory / called the bread his
body / and the win his blud. then it shall be easy to understand / that they be
rather confirmations of our faith / then the body it self. Sacraments / and
memorialles of the things paste / and not the thing they represent / and
signify. Romans 4.

The seuenthe preparatiue is / to add nothing unto this law nether to take any
thing from it. who can be a convenient disciple of God / and his doctrine /
that belyuithe not all things / and every thing necessary / for the salvation
of man / to be contaynid openly / and plainly / in the scripture Canonical.
or how can he be a Christian man that beliuithe one commandment of God / and
not the other. He that said / thou shall have but one God / says likewyce /
thou shall nether add / ner take any thing from the scripture / Deutt 4. but
shall observe it / at it is yeuen. so said Christ Matt. 28. so says saynct
Ion. cap. 21. like wice in the revelations of Jesus Christ our redemer cap.
22. What is more necessary for him that will read the scripture / or hyre it
preachid / then this preparatiue. First to be perswadyd that all verite / and
necessary doctrine for our salvation is contaynyd there in / and that the
holy church of the Patriarchs / Prophetis / and Apostelles beliuid / preachyd
/ and died for the same / and in the same doctrine. if thy heart be not thus
preparyd: but iudgist that gods law co^teynithe one part of souch doctrine as
is necessary for man's salvation: and the Bishopes laws an other part: thou
co^temnist and dishonorist the hole law / and yeuer thereof / and offendist the
commandment yeuen Deuteronomy. 4.12. and Proverb. 30. read diligently those places.
farther remember that this opinion is so ungodly that the hole scripture
endithe with this sentence if any man add unto the word of God / God will put
upon him / all the maledictions conteynid in the book. and if any man
demynishe any thing / of this prophetie / God will take from him souche part as
he has in the book of liffe Apocalip. 22.

The first table.
Caput IIII.
I Am the lord thy God / that browgth the out of Egypt / from the house of
seruytude. Thou shall have no strange Gods before me.
THis precept or Commandment has too members. The first requirithe that we
accept / account / and take the God that made / and perseruithe all thing /
the God Saday / omnipote^t / and sufficient / not only to be God: but also to
be our God / that helpithe us / succurrithe us / sauithe us / and only
defendithe us. The secund part for byddithe all false gods. This first part is
the ground / original / and fundation of all vertewe / godly laws or
Christian works. and where as this precept and commandment is not first
laid / and taken as thonly well where of springithe all othere vertews /
whatsoever be done seem it never so glorious / and holy unto the worold it is
nothing but very supersticion / and hypocrisye as Paul says / To. 14 Ebr.
11. What puttithe difference between the death of Socrates / and Esaias:
Diogenes / and Hieremie: Sophocles / and Zachary Euripides / and Steuine:
Homere / and saint John Baptist: saving only the knolege / and confidence in
this commandment: I am the lord thy god. what difference where there between
the Church of the pharisees / scribes / and Hypocrites / and the church of god
were not the knolege of this commandment. that containithe too most
necessary things. The true knolege of God* and the true honor of god Deu.
4.12. Exodus 19.20. Ge^. 12.17. The which fundatio^ / and ground of our
religion / boothe the Testame^tes every where teachithe. also the ymaige of god
in our soul thowghe we be borne in servitude of sin and blind unto all
godlinis: souche a sparkell / and dim light notwithstonding remaithe in the
soul / that our own conscience criethe out against us / when we utterly
conte^ne / the reverence / and divine majesty of God: as it apperithe by the
horrible / and ferfull death / of souche as thowght it more easy to destroy
there own living bodies / then to endure the conflict and dolours of there
own conscience with the judgment / and contempt of Gods laws / as it is to
be seen leuing profane exe^ples a part in Saul / and Judas: with all other
souche in our time / that are the causers of there own death. The subtiltes
of the devil must be taken head of therefore / and known betime / lest he
show us God in an other form then he shewithe himself in his word and this
commandment. Where he says that he is our God. to say: as well ready to
punish us / if we contemn him: as to healpe us if we love him. The devil
goithe a bout an other thing: and would all me^ / as long as they have a
purpose / and bent will to sin / think that God is a merciful God / agentle
/ sweet / and fyggie god / that winkithe / and will not see thabhomination /
and accustomid doing of i will. but when the conscience felithe the displeasure of
God and sekithe redress / he amplifyithe / and exaggeratithe the greatnis of
sin / shewithe it as foul / and as horrible as it is in dead / and more.
extenuatithe the mercy of god / makithe him / the^ a cruel / and an
unmerciful tira^t / as impossible to optaine mercy of / as to suck water out
of the dry pumpesse / or burning cole. Wherefore seeing his majesty is
invisible / and cannot be known of mortal man as he is: and like wyce be
cause man yeuythe little credit / or none at all unto his blyssid word he
presentia the all his works / heaven / and Earth unto man / to be testimonies /
and wyttnis of his great power / that man seeing those creatures / and
wounderfull preservation of the same / might think of god the maker of all
things / and thank him with all the heart: that he would say these words
unto him vile creature / and worms mete. I am the lord thy God. by his workis
he shewid himself thus unto Adame Genesis 2. and unto the natural phi. To. 1.
also unto every reasonable man Deu. 30. how be it so far has the devil
blindid many (would to God only the infideles / and not souche as be accomptid
Christians) that they take as mouche knolege of God by the contemplation of his
works / as Midas the knig by the contemplation of his gold. Wherefore seeing we
belyue with souche difficultye this word of God / I am the lord thy God: and
the devil has blindfoldyd / and darid our sight / and so be wicchid all
our senses / that we hyre / nor see any thing to the glory of God / and
salvation of our saules: he addithe yet other testimonies to acertaine us that
he is our God. and leui^the nothing undone / that might draw us unto a firm /
and constant biliue in him: setting before our Iyes the glorious and
wounderfull deliverance / and defense of the people: when he browght them our
of Egypt. souche testimonies addyd he unto his word / to stablishe our faith
allwaies. to Adame / and Abell / when the fire from heueane / burnid there
sacrifice Gene. 4.9.17. Exodus 12. so unto us: unto who^ he has yeuen the same
word To. 1. has yeuen for the confirmation thereof his dear son Jesus Christ
/ born / ded / and resuscitatid from death to show us him self and to teach
us that he is our God to saw us from the servitude of hell / and sin / and
to healpe us as many times as we call unto him in christ's name. for only in
him we cum to thacknolege of God that hewill be our God. Thowghe the Jew / and
the Turk / know there is but one God / and after there religion would honor
him: yet dout they whether he takith cure of them / will hyre there 2peticions
/ will be honorid of them / and how he will be be honorid. for they have not the
word of God / as Christ gave it but as they falsely interpretat it / to the
contumely / and dishonor of Christ. But we know him to be our God as this
commandment says: in Christ Jesus / Joan. 1. Matt. 11. Io. 16. When we have
a true knolege of him by his word / we must yeuen him the same honor / that his
commandment requirithe / to say: obedience and fere / faith / and love.
Repete the words again of the commandment / and mark them. I am the lord /
thy God. if he be lord: then has he power over body and soul: obey him
therefore lest he destroy them boothe. thy God if he be God / all things be in
his power / and has sufficient / boothe for the / and all other / and will
give it the / because he is thy god. he nedithe for him self nether heaven /
nether Earth / nor any thing / that is there in* and to put the out of dout
thereof / he browght not only the people out of Aegipt / to warant his
promise: but also send his only son / to dye for thy sake / that he might be
thine / and thou his. Romans 6. Esa. 53. Theffect now of this part of the
commandment is: to declare / and bring man unto a knolege of God as ye se.
and ons known by his word / requirithe also man's duty / to honor him / in
true / and perfete religion. the which co^sistythe in fere / faith / and
love. the which three points Moses dilige^tlie / and at large declarythe / in
the 6.7.8.9.10.11. Chapiters of Deuteronomy. and doothe nothing else in all them / but
expound this first commandment. I will show the partly how / and then read
the places / and learn more by thy self. In the begymyng of the 6. chapter he
shewithe wherefore thou should fere him / and keep his commandments / sayng
it shall be to thy profet. this is the manner of all men / that would have ^^y
thing done: first to show what profete folowithe the doing of it / that the
commodite / might excitat the mind / and study of him that should do it. Moses
says it shall be well with the. god will multiply thy sede / and give the a
land flowing with milk and honey. Now if thou fere the lord god / this shall be
thy reward. and the same self promise thou shall find / many times / annexid
with the fere of god / before thou co^ to the end / of the 11. chapter. al
health / and loy folowithe the fere of god. Mark those words well / and
print the^ in thy heart. fere of no i will / nor sickenis / contagious aer / or
diseace: so thou have this medicine of gods fere / in thy soul which
preseruithe health / and expulsithe all diseacis. Galenus has wrote^ books
de tuenda sanitate. That is to say to preserve health. so has Hippocr.
Cornelius Celsus and other. They prescribe those syx things to be obseruid of
as many / as would live in godd health. The te^perature / and condition of the
air. 2. Moderate use of mete / and drink 3. Motion and exercise of the body /
and rest of the same 4. Sleep and wacche as the complexion by nature shall in
time convenient require. 5. fullnis and Emtenys of the bode Gale. lib. 2. aph.
comment. 17. et lib. 2. de Compos. medic. 6. perturbations / and passions of
the mind. for many has died with souche passions of the mind with soden sorrow
as P. Rutilius. Plinius libr. 7. Cap. 36. and M. Lepidus. some with soden loy
as the Noble woman Policrata as Arist. wrytithe. so dyed Diagoras as Gellius
wextithe lib. 3. Cap. 15. and other as ye may read Plin. lib. 2. Cap. 53.
Valor. Max. lib. 9. cap. 12. Some died for shame as Diodorus Plin. lib. 2. cap.
53. Homere Vale. lib. 9. cap. 12. The phisicions promisithe health if these 6.
rules be obseruyd* but God says all those be inuayne with out the fere of
him Deu. 27.28.30. there se the word of God / And look the secound book of the
kniges cap. 24. How it was prouid true / where as the pestilence infectyd the
hole lannd of Canaan / from the Cite of Da^ / unto the Cite of Bersabee / in
three days. so that there died 70. thousand me^ in that short space. In the end
of the 6. chapter of Deu. Moses exortithe the people to fere God. to a vayde
the punishment / that folowithe the contempt of Gods commandment. and this
is the most apt / and best way / to persuade people / that carithe for no
vertew / nor will not be mouid with any promise / or reward / that folowithe
well doing. I am a Ielous God / and the lord thy God is in the mydle of the.
Which words declarithe / that when people will not obey his commandments /
and receive his love / and favor: he waxithe anger / and vsithe thextreme
remedy / the skurge of aduersite / that who so ever will not willingly be fere
means boghe / be forse shall be co^strainid to break. for nothing ca^ resist /
when he will punish. The first point the refore / of religion / is the fere of
God. The second is faith / and confidence in his word. Therefore says Moses:
Audi Israel, dominus Deus noster unus est, That is to say: Hire O Israel / the
lord / our God / is one God. Deuteronomy. 6. in this one God / thou shall put all thy
trust / and belyue. To persuade this faith into there hearts Moses put not
only the deliverance out of Egypt before there facis / But also the Seven
most mighty princes of the worold. Hittheum. Girgaseum / Aemorreu^ / Cananeum
/ Pherizeum / Hiueum / and Iebuseum. Deuteronomy. 7. and in the same chapter he
repitithe and inculcatythe into the ere this religion and faith / saing /
scias itaque quod dn^s Deus tuus ipse est Deus, Deus fidelis etc. That is to
say / know thou that the lord / thy God / he is thonly / and true God / and so
forth. Then read unto the end of the 11. chapter how busy and diligent Moses
is / hepyng argument / upon argument to persuade the people to belyue God / and
his word / and to stablishe this commandment / and rout it in there / and
our hearts. All the works of God heaven and Earth / all the Miracles wrowght
in the old Testament / and in the new were done to prove unto mortal man
this precept to be true. I am the lord / thy god / and be none other thing but
interpretations of this commandment to stablishe the verite of his word. The
third is love / wherefore he says love the lord / thy God with all thy heart /
all thy soul / and with all thy pour Deuteronomy. 6. Moses in thend of the chapter
/ shewith wherefore this our God should belouid. he will give you says he the
la^d that ye never deseruyd freely for his promise sake. and in the 7. chapter
/ he promisithe to destroy a people more strong then they be. in the 8.
chapter he says that he fed them in the wildernys / with met from heaven /
which they / nether there fathers never knew. By these and other many reasones
/ he prouokyd the people to this part of religion / the love of God. In case
any benefactour / or he that doithe good to an other / be to be louyd /
spetiallye this our god is to beloved says Moses. We may like wyce consider
his benefytes to wards us and so expulse this detestable and horrible
vnkyndenis toward him. As is the leauyng unto us of the scripture whereby we
know his blessed will for the grace of the holy ghost that ledithe us to
knolege / defendithe us from i will / and presetuithe us in vertew. The greatist
Argument of all / the birth / and death of his only son / yeuen for our
redemption. Then doothe Moses teach how we should love him / Deuteronomy. 6. with all
our heart / all our soul / and all our forse. Of these parts co^systythe
man for the heart is the origynall of all affectes and desires. when the law
requirithe the love of God with all the heart / it requyrythe all mSnes
affections to be sincere and pure / and holy directyd into the love and
obedience of God. For he is a gelous God: he is not content with the fourth
part / or the half / but requyry the the hole heart mind / will / affectious
and liefe of man. He is not content that we love him / with one part / and the
worold with the other. These words for byddythe not / but that we may love
our honest friends / parents / and other as it is wroten / Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. 5.
so that there love be in God / and for God: not equal / nor above the love of
God. if Election happen / that in the loving of the one / follow the hatred of
the other: thou art bound to hate thy father / thy friends / and also thyn own
liffe for the love of God / Mat. 10. last of all thou must love him with all
thy forse. by the which word is vndrestond all the powers boothe of body and
soul / the senses interioure / and exterior what so ever they be and as the
holy ghost has yeuen them. so that nether the inward man / nether the vtwarde
man be defylyd by sin / as Saynct Paul says 1. Thessal. 5. These words
must be thowght apond: that man aplye the yefft of the holy ghost aright to the
glory of God and profet of his church: whereof we be all members. one has
the yeffte of prophetie / to judge of things to cum: an other of knolege to
open the misterijs hyd in the scripture / an other the yeft to confort and give
consolation to the afflyctyd / the other the yeffe trewly to dispense and
distribute the gods of this worold with out fraud / the other the yefte to
persuade by the word of God people to ame^dement of liefe with the tongue / an
other with the pen / one the gyfft to serve God in the ministerye of the
church / the other to serve God in the ministry of the commune wealth / the
one apt and strong / wisse and prudent in affers of war / the other to keep
good rule and govern in peace / the one apt to one thing / the other to an
other. Every man therefore remember this commandment. Love God with all thy
forse: and apply the yefft that the holy ghost has yeuen the to the glory
and service of God. it is an horrible sin before god / theabuse of his
yefftes whether they be of the body or the soul / Matt. 25. Moses now as thou
seyst / has tawght us to know God / and shewid us how to honor him in faith
/ fere / and love: and showed many reasones why when should give him this honor
and obedience: so that the first part of the first commandment I am the lord
/ thy God: may be under stond of every man that is willing to know God and his
own salvation. Before he expundithe the second part of the commandment. Thou
shall have no strange Gods before me: he admonyshythe the people of a very
necessary doctrine. That is to say: how they should behave them selfs in
prosperity and wealth: and use the commodites of this worold. we know by
experience and daily prove that nothing more with drawithe man from the hononor
/ love / and fere of God / then those too. felicite / and aduersite. As Christ
teachithe our savior / Matt. 13. Marc. 4. Luc. 8. by the similitude of him
that sowyd and part fell by the way side / part upon the stones / part among
the thorns. by the sede in the stonye ground Christ vnderstondythe souche as
leave his word for the calamites / and affliction of this worold. By the sede
among the thorns souche as here the word of God: how be it / it bringythe
forth no fruit by reason of the cures of this worold / and decete of rychis.
Moses therefore shewithe like a good Prince and faithful preacher what is to
be don in boothe these states / and conditions of liffe. in prosperity / and
aduersite. so that if is consell be folowyd: there is nether prosperity /
nether aduersite / can with draw man: from the will and pleasure of god. The
first doctrine to keep man from the displeasure of God in prosperity is wroten
/ Deuteronomy. 6. Erit cum introduxerit te dominus Deus tuus in terram, quam iurauit
patribus tuis, Abraham, Isaac, and and dederit tibi civitates magnas atque
bonas, quas no^ aedificasti: Domos quoque plenas omni bono, quas tu non
impleuisti, and cisternas excisas, quas tu non effo disti, uineas et oliuas,
quas non plantasti, comederisque and satiatus fueris. Cauebis tibi ne forte
obliuiscaris domini, qui te eduxit de terra Aegypti, de domo seruorum.

That is to say / when the lord / thy god shall bring the into the land /
which he promisyd to thy fathers Abraham / Isaac / and Jacob / and shall give
the / great cites and good which thou never buldyst / howses furnyshyd with
all necessarys / which thou replenyshyds not / and water pittes that thou
dyggyst not / uynes and olyues that thou plantyst not / and thou eat and be
satisfiede beware thou for got not the lord / that browght the out of Egypt /
from the house of servants. Here seist thou what danger and peril is anexyd
whith abundaunce and prosperous fortune in this worold / and how commune an i will
it is: in manner taking effect in all men that possessythe the gods of the
worold. As Esai says: let us eat and drink / to morrow we shall die. As Moses
says Deuteronomy. 32. the people replynyshyd the^ felses with the gyfftes of god /
and rebellyd / using prosperity and god fortune for soke god. And Luc. 12. the
rich man said. My Soul thou have great riches and shall use them many yers:
take thyn eace / eat / drink / and be merye. By these examples thou seyst that
Moses prescribyd not with out cause this regle / how to use our selfs in
prosperity. The which rule contaynythe too precepts: the one to use moderatlie
the yefftes of god / and not to abuse them: the other to acknolege them to cum
from god and to put no trust in them. The riches of the worold abusyd
enge^drythe pride / and for gotefullnys of god. Therefore Moses admonyshythe
Chefelye man in his wealth to be ware he forgote not god. And in the 8. cap.
he shewithe the cause why we should not glory / nor trust in the^ / allthowghe
they be must iustlye and rightwysly gotten. god yeuythe the^ says he / and be
not gote^ with our labors and pain. I know what men ar wont to say. when
hard any of these new gospellers that aryche man acknolegid not god for god /
and confess the same unto other. So mouche may every man that is not out of
his wytt confess. Dauyd says not / the fool says with his tongue there is
no god / but in his heart psalm. 12. verily to acknolege only god to be God /
only to trust unto him / and not unto the creatures of the worold it is a rare
thing in prosperity. few think by how small a threde all the certayntye of
riches hangythe / and that suddenly they may peryche. then should man most
suspect the fortune of this worold when she smylyth most / be cause she is
brytytl and unconstant as the Poet Horace teachith when prosperity promisithe
securyte and rest in the gods of this worold: it is a hard thing / and rare /
verily to think only God to be the yeuer thereof / and can suddenly take the
things away that has be^ gather with great pains and trauelles. Therefore
he makithe many times of Aryche man / apowre man / of one that ruled all /
contemnyd of all / of Cresus Irus. and so punishithe because men folowithe not
this precept and commandment of Moses abuse not the yestes of God / and for
got him not in the time of prosperity. The other impediment that ledithe us
from this religion of God fere / faith / and love: is aduersite. whereof he
spekithe cap. 8. Deuteronomy. God led the xl. yers in the desert / to punish the / an
to te^pt the / to know what was in thy heart whether thou would keep his
commandment or not. Punishyd the / and suffrid the to hungre / fed the from
heaven whithe met thou knewist not / nether thy fathers knew not / to declare
unto the that man only leuithe not by bred but by all things that proceed
from tht mouth of God / lyuith man. when man is oppressyd with aduersites /
and troble in this liefe: then commithe thowghtes as thick as hail whether
God love him that is punishyd: disputithe why and what should be the cause of
these trobles / and aduersite / then he reuoluithe / tossithe / and turnithe
boothe the nature of God and man in his cogitations: knowithe God to delight in
doing well unto man / and that man of all creatures is the most excellent. he
fyndithe God severe / and of all creatures / man most miserable / and subject
to aduersites. and the more man applyethe unto the commandments of God: the
more miseris of this worold ar hepyd upon his head. it is not therefore with out
cause that Moses prescribythe a remedy / lest man should depart / being in the
thrall and brake of aduersite from this religion / fere God / beliue in God /
and love God. Moses would keep man in his obedience / and office toward the
law in declaryng the causes why God punyshithe. Shewythe that it is for no
hattred that he punishyth but for love. and that he fyndythe all ways in man /
just matter worthy punisheme^t as Paul says To. 5. that death by reason of
sin entrid into the worold / so that the integrite and perfetnis of mannis
nature by sin is loost / and made like unto the nature of the brute bestes /
fruits / and herbis of the fyld. Job. 14. and Isay cap. 22.40. Eccl. 14. Psalm.
102. therefore god for sin being anger / punishithe the miserable nature of
man being spoylid of his oryginall and first perfection with many calamites as
David says Psalm. 89. Defecimus in ira tua. That is asmouche to say / thou
being anger for sin we arre subject unto death. Read the hole psalm if thou
can. it is Moses prayer where in is declared how bryffe / and miserable the
liefe of man is for sin. unto this natural corruption is annexid our
wilful malice and contempt of God / as we se in Cain / and Esau / like wyce in
this people of Israel / which were diligently instructyd / and godly browght
up by Adame / Isaac and Moses: yea in our selfs that daily read and here
the word of God yet nothing the better. Therefore Moses says that God led them
in the wilder / nys to punish there sin. Which is the pryncipall cause of
all calamites. then punishythe he to prove souche as be his / whether they will
persevere with his commandment or not. Thus temtyd he Abraham / and Jacob for
the space of all his liefe. and laythe more aduersites many times upon souche
as be of his true church then upon other / As these examples declare. Manasses
the tyrant cut Esai the prophet a sondre with a saw / Apryes killyd Hieremie
The Byshopes Zachary / Herod John Baptiste / with other. When souche
aduersites happen: let noman depart from the true word of God / but say with
Micheas the prophet cap. 7. I will sustain the punishment of God / for I
have offendyd him. with Esa. 64. cap. behold we have offendyd / and long
contynewid in sin wherefore thou art anger. God when he punishyth: workythe
too godd deades at one time. Corectyth the sin / and callythe the sinner to
penance / as we have Examples in Dauyd / Osias and Manasse. and saynct Paul
says 1. Cor. 11. We are punyshid of the lord / lest we should be damnyd with
the worold. if thou be a godd man / and yet punyshyd / reyoyce: for the
punyshement is a testimony of the doctrine / and religion that thou professist
/ and have many fellows. The patriarchs / prophets / Christ / and the
Apostelles / which would rather suffer death / then deny the profession of
the gospel / Matt. 16.2. Tim. 3. Psalm. 123.115. There be many other causes why
God punishythe / and why the punyshmentes should be patiently taken / It were a
book matter to rehearse them. I will only speak of one cause more that Moses
wrytithe in the same 8. cap. and pass over the rest. God made the^ hungre /
and fed them with mere from heaven / that they should know / man lyuyd not only
by bred: but of all things / that proceed from the mouth of God. Some men
vndrestond that Moses menythe that the body lyuithe with bred corporal / and
the soul with the word of God / seeing that man consistythe of those too
parts: the body / and the soul. It is true / and a godd interpretation / how
be it / if these words be referryd only to the body in this place of Moses /
it shall be consonaunt with the circumstaunce of the text / and declare his
purpose the better. Thowghe man put mete into his body that of his one nature
men judge to norishe / yet except the favor and grace of God digest / and
dispose it / into every membre of the body / it norishithe not: as we se in
money men that eatithe mouche and many times in the day: yet is nothing the
stronger. The physicians call this diseace apepsian / cruditatem when there is
no digestion at all sometime dispepsian Deprauatam concoctionem / when the mete
is turnyd in to a contrary qualite. sometime vrady pepsian / Tardam
concoctionem. When the stomach digestythe with difficulty and long protract
of time. this I speak only to this purpose that nether mete / nether medycine /
nether physician a vaylithe: except God say ame^. if thou wilt take profet of
the thing thou eatyst: follow the phisycke of Paul 1. Tim. 4. speking of the
met. sanctificatur per sermonem Dei, ac precatione^. it is sanctified by the
word of God and prayer. it is not only lawful for the to eat it / but also
God will give the norishme^t. That the met and dryng fedythe not the body with
out the favor and blyssing of God: it is declarid Leuit. 26. Ose. 4. Miche. 6.
ye shall eat and yet not be satisfied. Thus doothe Chrystis Answer unto the
devil prove Mat. 4. when he vngryd in the body and not in the soul. Therefore
his answer must be referryd only to the body. Gods punishment therefore tawght
the Israelitis this doctrine that God yeuithe not only mete / but also vertew
there unto to norishe him that eatythe. Seeing now that the Israelites by
aduersite were browght unto the knolege of there sin and instructid with
this farther doctrine that God yeuithe as well vertew unto the mete to norishe
him that eatithe as the mete it self: there is no occasion that they should
therefore leave god / but rather accept the punishment with thanks as a good
scole master send to teach them there he al^ he and the will of God / as David
says psa. 1.8 Vtile mihi est quod in miseria^ deiectus sum ut discerem
decreta tua. That is to say. it a vaylithe me greatli / that I am punishid / to
lern thy commandments.

The first part of the first commandment contaynithe as thou seyst by the
interpretation of Moses the fo^taine and Original of all true religion and is
as the fundation and rowt from whence spryngithe all the other commandments
/ and is co^prehendid in these 4. words. knolege of God / fere of God / faith
in god and love of God. farther in the interpretation of the same: he has
tawgth his people / and us: how to use our selfs in prosperity and aduersite.
For each of them drawithe man from the 4. a fore rehersyd vertews: except the
mind of man be full lyd perswadid by the word of God / how amenes / and godly
moderation may be kept / when man has abundance. and how / to whom / and when
/ use liberalite / and dispensation of his gods. like wyce how man should
with patience sustain the hand of God in aduersite for the time of this
present liefe which Job describythe cap. 14. to be nothing but a vanite / by
these words Man born of a woman / lyuythe but a few days and is replenysshyd
with affliction / spryngythe and wethrythe a way as a flower / fleythe as
shadow and comot long endure so says Esai 22.40. If thou read the book that
wise Solomon wrote de contemptumundi. to say of the contempt or vanite of the
worold: Called Ecclesiastes thou shall not only lern what the worold and man is
but also take aduersites in the better part if thou follow his counsel. the
book contaynythe but 12. chapiters read and mark every monethe one Then at
the yers end thou shall read it over. if thou put the richis thereof into thy
head think thou have gaynyd well that year thowghe by the ponyshment of God /
thou have loost other ways all thy gods in the worold unto thy shurt.

Now folowythe the second part of the first commandment.

Thou shall have no strange Gods before my face.

This part of the commandment remouythe all false religion / and supersticion
/ where with all the glory and majesty of God might happen to be demynishid
or darkenyd in the soul of mani which chaunsythe as many times as man
attributythe unto any creature the thing that is dew only unto God. or when we
would honor God or do any thing acceptable unto him as we feign of our own
brayns and not as his word teathithe. This honor we aw only unto God. Faith /
love / fere / and prayre. now to attribute any of these to any creature is
Idolatry and to have false Gods before his face. only God should be our hope
/ faith / love and fere. Hyme only should we pray unto Esa. 8. Psalm. 18.28. To
pray / or trust in any ded saynct departed our of this worold is Idolatry and
against this commandment and those that do it has nether commandment nor
example in the scripture to approve there doings. souche as fere The menaces
and threteminges of the devil or of deuillishe people that myndythe the
subuersio^ of gods holy word and persecution of souche as follow it / and
belyuythe not that god has power to keep them under and will so do for his
words sake has false gods before his face for only he is to be feryd Matt.
4.10. Esa. 51. Souche as be yeuen to Astronomy / or other that
supersticiouslie observe the course and revolution of the heavens think they
can do good or harm / give good fortune or i will as those think and judge that
eleuate the figure of heaven to judge whatshall follow them / when they perceive
by there Natyuites under what sign the were born: offend against this
commandment. the which abomination has not only been vsid before our time
of superstitious persons / but also now a days of the^ that has a right
knolege of God. Souche as give over mouche faith unto Medicines / or the
nature of stones / and herbs as ye se 2. Paralip. 17. commit Idolatry. souche
as give faith unto the coniuration or sorsery of superstitious persons as to
pristes that bliss water / wax / boue / bred / ashes / candelles / or other.
to wycches or southsaiers where they abuse the name of God / to sing out the
fire of him that has burnid his hand / to stanche blud / to heal man or
best: or to souche as destenith what shall happen unto man / and what plenty
shall follow of grain and fruit in thearthe / health or sickenis in the air /
committithe Idolatry Leuit. 17. Deu. 18. I speak not against the knolege that
man sekithe for / whether it be in the heavens or in the earth / so that they
exte^d there study to this end / to glorify god i^n his works and not to
make the works god. well we be assurid by the scripture Hie. 10* and also by
those that kew not the scripture that no constellation of heaven /
mistemperature of the air / water / or earth can hurt him that ferythe god /
as the testimonys of the scripture declare. only the disobedience of man to
wards god makith man subject unto these diseacis and sikenis that man is
troblyd with all Ex. 5.9. Leui. 26. Nu. 14. Deu. 28^2. Re. 24.3. Re. 8.^. Pa.

hand and the Raven at the right hand. Esa. ca. 30. and 31. shewithe an other
kind of Idolatry which was vsyd and punishid in our fathers and likewice
daily we se the same with our Iye^. confidence and trust in the power of the
flesh. when souche as be in lege / and co^federatie to gather / to mouche
trust in there own stre^ghe / and power. read those too chapiters how the
Israelites entrid lege with the Egyptians / and what was there end / and
co^fer the same unto owre time what Cities / what Princes / and what strenght

the lege / se thend / how it auaylid nothing. to the same confusion shall at
lenghe com / all kings / and kingdoms that trust more in there riches /
munitions / and confederacy with me^: the^ in God. There is for biddin in this
part of the commandment: that noma^ should give thanks for any thing received
in this worold / to any other saving to god. Therefore Ose the Prophet callithe
the synagoge of the jews a hoar / because se attributid the gifts she
receauid of god unto here false gods. the same teachithe Esa. 57. this
idolatry is at large wrote^ Hie. 2. read the chap. and confer it with our
time that partithe the thanks / and preasis / that only should be yeue^ unto
god / with the saints departid / out of this worold. Every man as his
superstition ledithe him. he co^mendith his riches to god / and S. Eras. his ox
to god / and S. Luke / his horse to god / and S. Loye / for every diseace he
has a diverse patron / and honorythe him with the prayer / that only should
be said unto god allmighti / i^ the name of christ. Io. 15.16. this Idolatry
has in manner infectid all the latin church. the nature of his secrrate /
and pernicious i will / must be / by the word of god well markid / lest under the
cloak / and shadow of true religion / it deceive me^ of the trewthe. for this
idolattie says / and barithe me^ in hand / that she doothe not so desire
help of saints / or thank the^ for the benefits receauid / as though she
neglectid / or offendid the high / and only God: but grau^tithe and
co^fessithe god / to be the cheffe yeuer of all thgi^es / how be it / not only
for his mercies sake / and the merits of christ his son / our savior / but
also at the intercession and prayers of the ded saints / thus crafftelie and
under a pretense of true religion / doothe she sondre / and divide / the glory
/ and honor / dew only unto the father / the son / and the holy ghost / with
the sai^ctes in heaven / that knowithe nothing of our co^dicio^ / and state /
i^ this worold 63. Esa. by this means our helders / boothe the jews / and
the gentiles / minglid the rabble / and multitude of gods / with the only god
/ and maker of all thing not that they thowght the idols / or ymagis / to be
God. But thowght that way / God would be honoryd. the which is vere
idolatrye. for the law says / Thou shall not do the thing / that semithe
good in thy Iye / but the thing I have commaundyd the to do. Therefore to
auayde all false religion / and supersticion of the mind / and inward man / God
says thou shall have no strange Gods before me. the conscience therefore /
must be pure / and nere / from all privy / and secreat thowghtes / of
idolatry / apostasy / or defectio^: if we would god should approve our
religion / to be true. Every thing that we do for the honor of God / not
commaundid by his word / is as strange / and not acceptid of God. As all godd
intencions / faynyd works by man / and all things commaundyd by general
cou^selles / not expressyd in the word of God / by the Patriarchs / Prophets
/ Christ and the Apostelles / which be / and ever were / before God / the holy
/ and Catholic church. and shewithe us ho so ever add any thing to there
laws / ar the church of Antechrist Deuteronomy. 4.12. Apo. 22. so called God the
fire of Aharone sons / Nadab and Abihu a strong fire. to sai / souche as he
commaundyd not. God will have none other works of man then he requirithe in
his express word. He condemnythe by this law the wicked sacryfice / and
Idolatry committid in the private masses / where as people doothe not only take
from God / and Christ there dew honor / but also make an other God of bred /
which is no more the living God / then the golden calfe / of the Israelitis. as
not only the scripture / but also the reason of man / and the senses of all
brute bestes of the feld / ox / an sheep / with all other. The birds of the
air / and fishis of the water do the bare record. This unspeakable and most
abominable i will / is taken for the principal article / and cheffe pillar of
the true / and Apostolical church / of souche as beliue not / the Apostelles
writings. But how can it be the Apostolical church / when it repugnithe and
is clean contrary / to the Apostelles wryti^ges / Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Lu. 22.1.
Co. 10.11. like wice contrary to the testament / will / and institution / of
Christ Jesus our only savior / the auctor / and first yeuer of this blissid
sacrament / of his most honorable and precious blud / in his church. If it be
not lawful to change manes testament / nor to add / or take any thing from it
/ but to execute / and do every thing as it is there expressid / and none other
wice: Mouche more / noma^ should take upon him to change the testament of
christ. Oh that people for who^ Christ has shed his most innocent blud /
would understood and perceive this sensible / and manifest abomination. why
they belyue these seductors / and deceauers of Christian souls / that has
not as mouche as one Jot / or prick of the scripture to belpe themselfes with
all. Read / Read I beseech the christia^e reader Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. and
se how fare there abominable mass / is from the word of god. And think who
was the prist that ministrid this sacrament / and what people receauid it. Then
shall thou find the son of god / the wisdom of the father / the light of the
worold / the lamme that died for thy salvation / to be minister of this holy
sacrament and the church / or people that receauid it to be the elect / and
chosen Apostelles / christ's friends / that towght the gospel in all the
worold / and died for the same / as testimonies / of the truith / Ac. 1. the^

scripture. beliue christ / and his word which shewithe the truithe only / and

french man upon S. Denis / the Scote upon S. Anrey which is nothing else /

between the Troianes that trustid in Venus and here friends / and the Scotes
that trust in sanct Andrey / if they hope by there help / there warris shall

/ the God of batell. No godd man will take me as thowghe I meant Juno / Pallas /
or Venus / were as godd as Andrey or the Saynctes that be in glory for ever

patrones / or singular helpers of the saints / differ nothing in this point
from the ethinne or gentill. for as the one honorithe he knowith not what / so
doothe the othere. boothe folowi^g there own imagination / and superstition
without testimony and commandment of the scripture. Read the commentaries of
Thom. valois / and Nicol. triueth in the 4. book of S. August. De ciuitate Dei
/ ca. 30. and they will tell the / if thou beliue not the scripture what
supersticio^e is: where as be these words. Supersticio au^t uocatur oi^s
cultus superfluuius, quocunque modo superfluus, sieve ex superfluitate eoru^
quae colunt: sieve eoru^ quae in cultu^ assumu^tur: sieve ex modo assumendi. Hoc
em^ istud intelligitur noi^e superstitio^is, undecumque nomen origine^
habuerit. That is to say / supersticio^ is a superfluous religion / what ways
so ever it be superflous: whether it be of the superfluite of the things
honorid / or of the things vsid for religion or of the manner in religion. This
doutles is understand by the name of supersticio^ / from whens so ever the name
has his begi^ning. what so ever thou do / to pleace the allmihtie / if it be
not commau^did in his word it is superflous spersticio^. Remember therefore this
part of the commandment. thou shall have no strange gods before my face /
and honor god / save thy soul / avoid Idolatry as his only word teachithe:
and beware of man's laws.

Caput V. The second commandment.
Thou shall make the no ymayge / or any similitude / of things in heaven a
boue / in earth benethe / or in the water under the earth. Thou shall not
worship / nor honor them: for I am the lord / thy God / a Ielous God /
punyshing the iniquitye of the fathers / in the chyldre / that hate me in the
third and fourth (generation.)
IN the first commandment we lernid / that God is the only / and sole God.
and that we should not think / nor feign any other besides him. farther that
commandment / expressythe what this our one God is / and how affectionatyd /
or myndid toward us. full of mercy / and ready allwaies to succur / and ayed /
boothe soul / and body / in all affliction. shewithe us farther / how we should
honor / and reverence this / our allmighty and merciful God. so that thend /
and hole sommne of the first commandment is / that only God would be known
/ of his people to be God / and honoryd as god. so doothe god first instruct
the mind / and soul of man / before he require any outward work / or
external reverence* or else all together / were hypocrisy / what so ever show
/ or perfection it s^mythe to have / in the Iye of the worold. He laithe
therefore the first co^maundame^t as a fundation of all true religion. as the
original / and spring of all vertewe: and openythe the well / and fountain of
al misheife / and abhominatio^ / in these words / thou shall have no strange
gods / before my face. this second precept and the too other / that follow in
the first table / teachithe us / how to honor god in external religion / or
outward works / and to show the fere / faith and love that we bare unto god
in our ha^tes / unto the worold. Too of these last commandments / shewithe
what we should do / and the third which now Iexpou^d / what we should not do.
The purpose / end and will of this second commandment is: that gods pleasure
is / unto us / that we should not profane / or dishonor / the true religion /
or honor of god / with superstitious ceremonies / or rites / not co^mau^did by
him. wherefore by this second commandment / he callithe man from all gross /
and carnal opinions / or judgments of god. the which the folishe / and
ignorant prudence / and wit of man / co^ceauithe: where as it iudgithe
without the scripture and forbidithe external Idalatrie / as in the first
internal.

This commandment has three parts. The first takithe from us / all liberty
/ and lyce^ce / that we in uocase represe^t / or manifest the god invisible /
and inco^prehensible with any figure / or ymaige / or represe^t hi^ / unto our
senses that can not be co^prehe^did / by the wit of man nor angel.

The second part for byddythe / to honor any ymayge.

The third part shewithe us / that it is no need to present God unto us / by
any ymayge.

Moses Deuteronomy. 4. yeuithe a reason of the first part / why no ymaige should be
made. Remember says he / to the people: that the lord spoke to the in the
vale of Oreb: thou hardist a vaice / but sawist nomaner similitude / but only a
vaice (hardist thou) Esa. cap. 40.41.45.46. dilige^tlie she with / what an
absurdite / and vndece^t thing it is to profane the majesty of god
inco^prehe^sible with a little block or stone: a sprit / with a^ ymayge. The
same doothe Paul / act. 17. the text therefore for biddithe all manner of ymagys
/ that are made / to express / or represent allmyghtie God.

The second part for byddithe to honor any ymayge made.

The first word honor / signifijthe: to bow head leg / kne / or any part of the
body / unto the^ / as all those do / that say they may with good conscience /
be suffrid in the church of Christ. To serve them / is to do sum what for
there sakes / as to sense them with incense / to gild / to run on
pylgrymayge to them / to knele / or pray-before them / to be more affectionat
to one / then to the other / to set lights before them with souche like
supersticion and Idolatry. God be preacyd / I may be short / or writ nothing
at all in this matter / because souche as I write unto / my country men: be
perswadid all ready aright in this commandment.

This second part shewithe us / how Idolatry procedythe / and takythe place in
mennys conscience. The mind of man when it is not illumynatid with the spryt of
God / nor gouernyd by the scripture / it ymaginythe / and faynithe god / to be
like unto the ymagination / and concept of his mind / and not as the scripture
teachythe. When this vanyte / or fond ymagination is co^ceauyd in the mind /
there folowithe a farther success of the i will. he purposythe to express / by
sommne figure / or ymaige / God in the same form / and similitude / that his
ymagination has first pryntid in his mind. so that the mind conceauythe the
Idol / and after ward the hand workythe / and representythe the same / unto
the senses.

Therefore / God first for biddythe / this inward / and spiritual Idolatry /
of the mind / when he says / thou shall have no strange Gods before my face.
if the mind be corruptyd and not perswadid a right: then folowithe the making
of ymaiges / and after / the honoring of them. The cause therefore of external
Idolatry is internal / and inward ignorance of God / and his word / as
Lactantius wrytithe in his book / of the oryginall of error. As it cannot be
other wise / but where as the air is corruptid / there must follow pestilence /
and infection of the blud Galen. lib. 1. De diffe. feb. cap. 5. So where the
mind is not purely perswadid of god / must follow this gross / and sensible
Idolatry / that would honor God in an Idol. The oryginall cause why the ar
made is / that man thinkythe / God would not be present / to healpe him /
except he be / presentyd somwayes unto the recarnall Iyes / as the example of
the Israelites declarythe. that requiryd Aron to make the^ Gods / that might
led them in there Journey. They knew right well / that there was but one God /
whom they knew / by the miracles / that he wrowgth among them. but ^hey thowght
/ he would not be present / and at hand with them / except they might se him in
sum corporal figure / and ymaige / and that the ymayge / might be a
testimony of his presence. so se we that noman fallithe into this gross
Idolatry: but souche as be first infecryd with a false opynion of God / and
his word. then say they / they wourshippe not the ymaige / but the thing
representid by the ymaige. against whom writithe saint Augustine in Psalm. 118.
et 113. in the 4. book of the cite of God cap. 5. that ymaiges take a way fere
from men / and bring them into error. The aunciant Romans more religiously
says he / honoryd there gods / with out ymagis. Seeing there is no
commandment / in any of the boothe testame^tes / to have ymagis / but as ye
se the contrary. and likewice the universal / catholic / and holy church /
never vsid ymagis / as the wrytinges of the apostelles / and prophetis /
testify: it is but an ethnicke verite / and gentiles Idolatry / to say / God
and his saints be honoryd in them / when that all Histories testyfie / that
in manner ffor the space of fyve hundryth yers / after Christ's ascensio^ / when
the doctrine of the gospel was most sincerly preachid / was no ymagy vsyd.
would to God / the churge were now / as purely / and well instructid / as it
was before these auaricious ministers / and do^me doctors of the lay people /
were made preathers / in the church of god. Read August. Epist. 49. et Psalm.
113. therefore saynct John biddith us / not only beware of honoring of ymagy /
but of the ymagis selfs. Thou shall find the origynall of ymagis i^ no part of
gods word: but in the wrytinges of the gentiles / and infideles / or in souche
that more folowid there own opinion / and superstitious ymaginations / then
the auctorie of Gods word. Herodotus li. 2. says that the Aegyptions / were
the first that made ymagys / to represent there Gods. and as the gentiles
fashenyd there gods with what fygures / the lystyd: so doothe the Chrystians.
to declare God to be strong / they made him the form of a lion. to be vigilant
/ and diligent / the form of a dog. and As Herodotus says libr. 2. Mendesij
/ formyd there God Pana withea gotes face / and gotes legs / and thowght they
did there god great honor / because among the^ / the herd men of gotes / were
had in most estimation. So doothe those that would be accomptyd christianes /
peynt God / and his saynctes with souche pyctours as they ymagine / in there
fantazies. god like an old man / with a horehed / as thowghe his vthe were past
/ which has nether beginning / nor ending. S. George / with a long spear /
upon a Iolie hakeney / that gave the dragon his death wou^d (as the Peinters
say) in the throwght. Saint whit with as many round cheses / as may be pei^tid
a bout his tabernacle. No difference at all between a christian man and
gentille in this Idolatry / saving only the name. for they thowght not there
ymagis to be god / but supposid that there gods would be honorid that ways /
as the christianes doothe. I writ these things rather in a contempt / and
hatred of this abominable Idolatrye / then to lern any English man / the
truythe. For my belyue / and hope is / that every man in England / knowith
prayng to saynctes / and knelyng before ymagies / is Idolatry. and
instruments of the devil / to lead men / from the commandments of God. And
that they are apoyntid in many places to be as doctors to teach the people:
these doctors / and doctrine the bishopes / and pastors / shall bewail /
before the judgment sete of god / at the hoar of death. and like wice the
princes of the worold. Who is office is / daily to read / and learn the
scripture / that they them selfs / might be able to judge the bishops
doctrine / and also / se them apply the vocation they are called unto. it is
not only a shame / and an indecent thing for a prince / to be ignorant what
Curates his soubiectes has / throwghe all his realm / but also a thing so
contrary unto the word of God / that nothing prouokythe more the Ire of god /
against him / and his realm / then souche a contempt of gods commandment.

The third part declarithe / that it is no need to show God unto us / by
ymaiges. and prouithe the same / with three reasones / first. I am the lord /
thy God: that louythe the / helpithe the / defendithe the / is present with
the. belyue and love me / so shall thou have no need / to seek me / and my
favorable presence / in an ymaige.

The second reason. I am a Ielous god / and cannot suffer the to love any thing
/ but in me / and for me. When we too were maryd / and knit to gather / for the
love that I bore unto the. I gave the certain rules / and precepts / how in
all things / thou may keep my love / and goddwill toward the / and thou
promisydes me obedience / unto my commandments / Exodus 19. so honor me / and
love me / as it sta^dithe wroten in the writings / and inde^tures wroten
between us boothe. I cannot suffer / to be other wyce honoryd / then I have
tawght in my tables / and Testament.

The third reason is that God reuenchithe the prophanatio^ / of his divine
Majesty / if it be tra^scribyd to any creature / or ymayge. and that not only
in him / that committithe the idolatrye / but also in his posteryte / in the
third / and fourth generation / if they follow there fathers idolatry / as I
give mercy / in to the thousand generation / when the chyldre follow there
fathers vertewe Then to avoid the Ire of god. an to optaine his favor / we
must use no ymaigis to honor him with all. this ye may read Nu. 12. Ie. 32. and
Esa. 39. how King Ezechias sons / loost there fathers kyngdomme / an were
caryd / into captivity for there fathers sin. Read the 13.14. and 15. chap.
of Deu. and se how Moses interpretatithe this second commandment more at
large. Gods laws expulsithe and puttithe images out of the church / Exo. 20.
Deu. 5. then nomannes laws / should bring the^ in. As for there doctrine / they
teachethe vnlernid: it is aweake reason to stablishe them withal. A man may
lern / more of a live ape / then of a ded image if boothe should be browghte in
to the scole / to teach.

Caput VI. The third Commandment.
Thou shall not use the name of the lord / thy God / inuayne.
The end of this precept is / that we always use reuere^tlye / the name of
god. that is to sai the majesty and essence divine / that consistithe in one
divine nature / and essence / and in there persons. the father / son / and
the holy ghost.

This most honorable / ferfull / and blyssyd name / noma^ should irreverently
profane / or temerouslie without godd aduisme^t / ons thi^cke upon / or speak
of. but diligently take heed of these three things. first / that what so ever
we thi^cke / or speak / be agreeable / and co^sona^t / unto the excelle^tie /
and holi^is of his name / and exte^d to the setti^g forth of his glory. Second
/ that we abuse not his holy word / nor pervert the meaning / and misterijs
there of / to serve our avarice / ambition / or folly. but as he has openid
him self / and his will in his word / so to know him / so to fere him / so to
love him / so to serve / so to i^struct our selefes in faith / and so to
teach other. Thyrdly / that we reuere^tlie speak / and judge / of all his
works / with out detraction / or contumely / acknolegyng his inscrutable
prudence / and justice in all things / with laud / and preace / as well in
aduersite / as in prosperity / Psalm. 34.

They obey this commandment / and use the name of god aright / that preach
allmighti god as he co^maundithe in his word. that pray unto him as it
teachithe / to give him thanks for aduersite / and prosperity / as it
teachithe / to confess hi^ before the worold / as it teachithe. these be the
works of this third commandment / and be co^me^did unto us / in all the
scripture. As well unto the princes and magistrates of the worold / and every
private person / as unto souche as be appoyntyd unto the ministry / and
office of the church. That every private person is bound to teach souche / as
be under him / the fathers there children / the elders the younger / thou may
read in these places of the scripture / Deuteronomy. 4.6.11. Psalm. 77. Tob. 1 That
the princes should do the same unto there subjects / read. Deu. 17.2. Re. 1.3.
Reg. 10. Job. 4. Psa. 30.50. As for the ministres duty / there be as many
places that co^mau^dithe the^ to do there office / as be names of books / and
in manner chapiters in the Bible. As be for prayers unto god / and thanks
yeuing / how / and when it should be do^ne / the book of Psalms / writings of
the prophetis / and apostelles / like wice the commandment of our savior
christ declarith / Mat. 6. Io. 14. The confession of God / and his word before
the worold / is co^mau^did in boothe testame^tes.

And confirmyd with the extmple of all me^ / that louid the truithe / from the
beginning as Abel / Seth / Noha / Esaias. Christ / and his Apostelles. Yea of
the simple and mayed / and prisoner in the house of Naaman syrus 4. Re. 5. that
feryd not to confess the living God / in a strange country / before the^ that
were Gods ennimies. this maid shall da^ne in the last judgment all those that
for fere not only in a strange country / But also at Home / dar not confess
the truyth. In these four works / ar co^teinid all other that appertain / to
the setti^g forth of gods glory / as be these. To lern the word of God /
teach it unto other to promote it with example of honest / and godly lieffe.
when the glory of god / the defense of the truithe / the conservation of
justice / and deliueraince of innocence requirithe: to make open / an unknown
truithe / and to confirm the same. To swear / or take an oath / before a
lawful judge / is the work also / of this commandment / and settithe forth
Gods glory / Deu. 4. for as Paul says / all co^trauersis ar endid by the
vertew of an oath. So have we examples in Paul To. 9. in Abraham / and Isaac /
with Abimelech. Jacob / and Laba^ / Gene. 31. between Booz and Ruth / Ruth. 3.
so of God Abdias / 2. Re. 18. The oath thus taken / declarithe him / that
receauid it / to acknolege / and give unto God only / this honor. that he alone
knowithe what is in man's heart / and like wyce byndithe Gdd / to revenge / and
punish him / if he swear false. unto the which pain / the condicione and
tenor of the oath / bindithe him. And makythe himself / the vessel wherein /
god may exercise his displeasure / and justice. for God will not leave him
vnpunishyd / that takythe his name in vain / as it is wroten in the second
part of this commandment / Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. 5. These be the works requirid of
us in this third commandment. the which can be don of noman / but of such
as first know God in Jesus Christ / and for his merits be reconsilid / and
has his sins for yenen. then they spring out of the fountain / and
original of all godd works / faith / love / and fere of God / which be
works of the first commandment. All other / whether it be prayer / preaching
of Gods word / confession of his name / or yeuing of tha^ckes / with souche
as follow in the next commandment / and likewice in the second table /
pleasythe god / none other wyce / then they proceed of faith in the mercy of
God / throwghe Christ Jesus / our savior. As these works agree with the
commandment / so be there works contrary / and repugnant unto this
commandment / that says / thou shall not take the name of the lord / thy
God in vain* the which is done diverse ways as it shall appear in the
Nombryng of certain daily vsyd vices / and horrible blasphemis / daily vsyd /
not only vnpunishyd / but also as a thing commendable / and worthy preace of
the most part of people. The most horrible abuse of this holy / and most
ferfull name is / among souche as think there is no God to renumerat vertew /
nor to punish vice / as the Epicures say. would to God the same blasphemy /
had corruptyd none / that bare the name of Christianite. There were always in
the church souche / as it aperythe Esai. 22. cap. and Luc. 13. and be at this
day agreat nombre / that say not platlye and plainly there is no God / but by
certain circumloquutions / and paraphresis as well by words / as i will
conversation of liffe / thinck there is no heaven / nor hell. and beliuithe not
asmouche the Scripture of God as the words of him that knowithe nether god ner
godlinis.

The second sort / that abuse this holy name of God / be those that under the
pretense / and name of God his word / and his holy church / sekethe reawne
glory / and profete. As the Pope / under the title / and pretense of Gods
ministry / has gote^ him self / not only a Bishope ricke / but also the
hole monarchy / i^ manner of all Europa. A rychere kingdom / then any prince of
the worold. which never sessid from his beginning / to move Christian princes
/ to most cruel / and bludy war. under the cloak and mantell of gods name.
what means and crafft / has he found to maintain this horyshe / and
Antechrist sete / of abomination: Idols / peregrinations / masses /
dispensations / absolutions / defencions of all things abominable. Tyrannies
against vertew / stablishmentes of his own laws / abrogations of Gods laws
/ Emptyng of heauin / and filling of hell / blyssyng of things exterior /
oil / bell / bred / water / with other that be not cursyd / and cursing of
the souls / that Christ redemyd with his precious blud / with a thousand more
/ souche abominations under the name and pretense of god / and his holy
church. the which nether the patriarchs / nether the prophets / Christ /
nether his Apostelles / never knew of / as the boothe testamentes doothe bare
record. The same doothe souche as preach in the church of God / there own
ymaginations / or decres of men. for be there doctrine never so false / it
has a fere title / and name of Gods word / when it is / but a subtle
quidite of Suns / a vain sophisme of Aristotelle / a superstitious d^cre of
the bishopes laws / a copy of vain glory / and crafty connection of words
to satisfy the most part of the audience / and to flatter the richeste.
wrethyng and wresting the simple verite of Gods words / into as many forms /
and diuerses sentences / as be vain / and carnal affections / wrowght within
his ungodly heart. so for the law of god / they preach the law of man: for the
gospel / judicial supersticion / for Christ / them selfs / which honor not
Gods name / as the law of the holy / and catholic church of Christ /
teachithe / but dishonorithe / and takythe it in vain / with the church of
Antychrist / and the devil. for christ bid his disciples preach none other
then he himself commaundyd them Matt. 28. cap. yea he showed that the holy
ghost / the sprit of truythe should teach none other thing / then by him was
tawght Joan. 15. therefore souche as will ocopy the office of a preacher /
first must be well lernyd / in the things that appertain unto the gospel.
the^ fre from all souche affections / as rather sykythe him self / and the
worold / the^ the fartherau^ce of the doctrine he preachithe. it is not inowghe
that he preach the truithe / but that only he have a respect unto the glory
of Christ. then shall he boldlye speak the truithe without respect of persons
/ not temperyng his oration with colors of flaterye / but hardelye call
vertew / vertew: and vice / vice / as he seythe occasion who so ever be his
audience. S. Ianin his Epistole capit. 3. shewithe who is apt for this office
to preach the word of God. so doothe christ Matt. 10. so doothe Paul / 1.
Timo. ^. Tit. 1. so doothe Moses / and the prophets. nothing more blasphemythe
the name of God the^ false doctrine / and souche as sekythe them selfs and can
use the word of God / as the se there audience / and not as it is commaundyd
them / by the word of God. souche preachers has browght the superior poures
of the earth unto a contempt of gods word / hatred of the preacher when he
tellythe truythe / and the vnlernyd into blyndnis / and ygnorancie.

Those abuse the name of God / that sike help of damnyd sprytes or of souche
souls as be departed out of this worold. as Saul did 1. Reg. 28. or those that
by Necromancie or souche like incantamentes abuse the name of god to resuscitat
ded bodies / or call sprites departed unto the body again / which is nothing
else but an illusion / and craffte of the devil / to make men belyue lies.
Those men in English be called coniurers who vsithe arts for byddin by Gods
laws / And also by the laws of Ethnikes / before Christ was born. Titus

Cicer. wrytythe De Repub. the more I wondre / that any souche supersticious

spetialli his third book de occulta philozophia / that is to say / of secreat
philozophie. With many other / that spared no labor / in setting forth souche
ungodly works. They browght first thabuse of Gods name in to christian
men's hearts / and tawght them the same superstityon / that ons was namely
among the Persians / and Aegiptians. Valerius lib. 8. cap. 6. for as among the
gentiles there were sommne called Augures that by observation of the birds of
thaire / in there fleyng / criyng / and eating / made men belyue / the knew
things to comme: so among the Christyanes be sum / that think they can do
the same. As if the Pie Chatter / they look for gestes. If the croo cry / they
say we shall have rain. If the hole hoyle / it is sign of death.

And as there were sum / that by the observation of the Sterres / took upon
them to speak of things to com / by certain supersticious / and dyuyllishe
incantacions / which the persians call Magos / the Greeks philozophos / the
Latynes sapientes / Galli druidas / The Aegiptions sacerdotes / the Indies
gymnosophistas / the Assyrians chaldeos / so is there among the Chrystianes the
same sort of people / which be called soothe sayrs / or pronosticatours / that
writ / and speak of things to comme. as when Iubiter rulythe the
constellations above / and is not impeachyd / nor let by the conjunction of his
contrary planete / we shall have a godd year / and aplentyfull. If Saturn / and
souche as astronomers attribute / contrary qualites unto reign / we shall

the river called Tyber with a seue and browght it full of water into the temple
of the Gods. So among Chrystyane men be the same sort of people / that by
thabuse of Gods name throwghe the help of the devil doothe many times work
the same / in helyng man / and lest. as not many yers sith I was born in hand
of a poor man that erryd by ygnorau^ce that this Medycine could hele all

so be there among people Chrystenid / that know nether art / nor science / that
take upon them / to know the same by there countenance / the lines of there

profetable / to learn / and exercyce the art of Geometry. but the damnable art
mathematical / is for bydden. The law menythe Astrology / and Astronomy
which ar vsyd well but of a few men. The Astrologer / is he that knowithe the
course / and motions of the heavens / and teachythe the same / which is a
vertew / if it pass not his bonds / and be come of an Astrologer / an
Astronomer. who takythe upon him to give judgment / and Censure of these
motions / and course of the heavens / what they pronosticat / and destenye unto
the creatures of the earth / man / best / and other. what shall be the
temperature of the air / the condition of the Earth / the state / and success
of souche fruit / as it bryngythe forth. By this knolege they fore speak of
pestilence / and other diseacis / and seythe the death of great men to cum /
and souche commotions / and wars / as shall follow / between the princes of
the wotold. And Thus they sey they know / by the course of the heavens. Where
as they sethe conjunctions of many planetis of rygures / and fatal disposition
/ and qualite concur: by reasone of whois influence / into these inferior
parts / all those calamites must happen. Here they abuse not only the name of
God / and the Natural discurse of reason / which has comprehendid the
motions / and course of heavens: but also heavens it self. and attribute unto
the heavens / the thing that only appertainithe to god: to sai / the health
of man / and sichnis of man / the ple^tie of the earth / and scarsite of the
same. the regiment of commune wealths / and the lyffe and death of the
gouerns thereof. There knolege and practice in these things is nothing at all:
for almighty god has not made the heavens / to that end / and purpose that
man should lern of them / good fortune / or i will / as it is plain Genesis 1. in the
second day God made the fyrmament / and the superior speres / which the text
callythe rakiah. to this end / that it should seperat The waters that be under
the firmament / from those that be a boue the firmament. and God callid the
firmament heaven. in the 4. day God made the Son / the Moon / and the
Sterres. And shewithe to what purpose / and end he made them. the one to have
dominion in the day / the other in the night / and God put them in the
f^rmament of heaven / to give light unto the earth* those rule in the day / and
night / and put diversity between light / and darkenis / to deuyde the year
into his parts. The spring / Somer / Autumn / and winter. They are in signs
like wyce says the text. The which the housbound man that tylythe / and
sowith the grown / obseruithe with out supersticion / to sow / and repe his
corn. he castythe it into the winter / and receauythe it again in the Somer.
So doothe the Mariner / mark the revolution of the Moon / his decrese / and
increse where by he knowithe the tides / the Ebb / and flow of the sea. and the
later phisicions Auicenne / and Auerroys has like wice assignid there use in
man's body. Therefore they apoynt diversity of days / in the practice of
phisike. one to be more apt for letting of blud then other / to purge / and to
balne / the^ the other. If they may be obseruyd without superstition / it may
be suffryd. so notwithstonding / that souche as observe not these later rules /
may booth ministre / and receive medicines. for the heuenes were made to serve
us / and not to master us. were created for man / and man not for them.
Therefore it is a false supersticion / to say good / or bad / plentythe / or
scarsite / sickness or elthe / war / or peace / dependithe of the influence of
the heavens. Or he that is borne under one sign / to be more fortunate / then
he that is borne under the other / as this Egyptiacall / and Ethnycke folyshnis
/ barythe men in hand. The Pronostication of these blind Prophetis / is good to
be born in a man's beso^me to know the day of the monethe. The rest of there
practice / is not worth one hawe / as Moses teachithe / Deuteronomy. 28.29.30. Leuit.
26. Three. 2. Malach. 2. Where as ye may se / that all these illes and many more
/ then the Astronomers spekythe of / commythe unto us for sin / and the
transgression of Gods commandment It is nether Son / nether Moan / Jupiter
nor Mars / that is the occation / or matter of wealth / or who / plentythe / or
scarsythe / of war / or piece. Nether is the cause of penitence the
putrefaction of the air as Galenus wrytythe / libr. 1. De diffe. feb. cap 5.
But the contempt of Gods commandment is the cause / as thou may read in
the chapiters of the scripture alitle before rehersyd. The Air / The Water /
and the Earth has no poison in them selfs / to hurt there lord / and master
man. But first man poysenithe him self with synn: and then God vsythe these
Elements ordeynyd for the lief of man / to be thoccation of his death. Read
the places and know that godd health is nom bred among the blyssynges of God /
and apperteynythe unto those that fere and keep Gods Commandments / and not
to those / that be destenyd to live long / by the favor / and respects of
planetes And the i will / of what kind so ever it be / is the malediction of God /
against sin. The phisicians say that the chefyst remedy against pestilence is
to fle from the place where the Air is corrupt.

Gods law says / fle whether thou wilt. Adherere faciet tibi Dominus
pestilenciam, donec consumat te de superficie terrae, Deutero. 28. That is to
say: The lord shall make the pestilence cleue and associat the till it consume
the from the worold. Again in the same chapter. the diseace or syckenys
shall be faythefull. that is to say stick fast to the / use what medicines thou
wilt. Galenus says libr. 1. De differ feb. capit. 4. that the cheffe remedy /
to preserve from pestilence / is to purge the body from superflous humores / to
have a fre / and liberal wynd / and to avoid the abundaunce of mete / and
drink. God says / nothing preseruythe / but the observation of his
commandments. If we offend / the best remedy is penence / and amendment of
liefe. It makythe no forse how corrupt the Air be / so the conscience / of man
in Christ be clean from sin. Thoghe there dye / a thousand of the one side of
the / and ten thousand one the other side / thou shall be sauffe / Psalm 90. He
will let the live / to serve longer in the worold / to the glory of his name.
And if tbow die / it is because / no malice of the worold / should corrupt thy
lieffe / and bring the from God. Farther to take away the miseries of this
worold. If souche as care not for God / escape in the time of pestilence / or
war: it is to call them unto a better lyffe / To. 1. If they amend not: they are reseruyd / to agreater pain. this is spoken not as thowghe I conte^ned the
yefftes of god: philosophy / and physic / but to: take from me^ / all vain
hope in the artificial medicyns / and give only the glory unto the name of God.

They abuse the name of God / that perform not the thing they promise / in
Gods name / by any oath / or vow / made according to the law of God / whether
it be between man and God / as in the holy Sacrament of Baptism / and the
holy super of the lord / where as we swear / and promise to lyeue after his
will and pleasure. Or when man / to man byndithe^ him self / to any conditions
/ or promeses by the invocation of Gods name / or testimony of his own
conscience. If the one keep not touch and promese with the other: he that
offendith / abusythe not only his own faith / whicht should be allwyes simple
/ and true: but also contemnythe the Majesty / and omnipotency of God / in
whois name / the oath was taken. And not only the law of God But also the law
of man / punyshithe this horrible periurye / as ye may read / Leuit. 24. How he
that took the name of God in vain / was stonyd to death: so says David /
Psalm. 5. So says this Commandment / God will not leave him vnpunyshyd /
that Namythe him in vain. Examples we have in Ananias / and his wief / Acto.
5. The children of Israel were slain for perjury / Esa. 10. Temperour Just.
Nouellis constitut. 77. commaundithe to put to death the blasphemours.

Souche as trust in there own strenghe / or riches / abuse / and hlaspheme /
this name of God. Which never was / nor never shall be / vnpunyshyd in this
worold / in the worold to cum / or in booth. Examples we have in Assure / Esa.
10. Holofernes Judith. 13. Ajax / that said he could over com his ennymyes /
without God. At lenghte was not ouercom of his ennymyes / but kyllyd him self.

Those that swear by the name of God / and like wyce by the name of Saynctes /
offend this commandment. As when the form of there oath is thus. AS HELP ME
GOD and all Saynctes. For the oath must be only in the name of God / Deuteronomy.
6.10. Iosu. 23. How this sin in sweryng by any then God is punyshyd Read /
Hiere. 5. Soph. 1. Red the 7. chapit. of Joshua / and learn the form of a true
oath there / when he constraynyd Achan to confess the truythe / by the vertew
of an oath. It is a manifest Argument of impiete / and false belyue / when
people swear by any creatures.

Souche as give there books a holy / and relegious title / and the contents
thereof / is none other / then the defense / of supersticio^ and inquyrye / of
vain glory / or his own private commodite / abuse the name of God.

They offend greuouslie this commandment / that swear without necessite. More
greuouslie / when for every light tryfell / or matter of nothing. Most
greuouslie / when men swear to maintain a false cause / to obtain an i will
purpose / to oppress the truythe / or to iu / stifie the wrong. The oath
therefore must be as Hiere says / cap. 4. in verite / judgment / and justice.
There the Prophet ex^^tithe the Israelites / to reverence the Name / and glory
of god. And that they beliue stedfastlye / the universal providence of God.
That they abstain from false oaths / and perjury. For God seith not only /
the works of man / but also the words / and thowghtes of the heart. Therefore
noman should swear / except he know perfetly the thing to be true / that he
swerythe.

That is the first thing that man should have in his conscience / before he
swear. The second / that he swear not temcrou^lie / nor lightly without
reverence of Gods majesty / but with judgment / that is to say / when
necessite constraynythe / for the glory of God / or defense of vertew / at the
commandment of a just / and laufull appoyntyd judge. Thyrdly that it be in
justice / that the oath extend to nothing / that is against Gods laws. if the
oath have not these three cempanyons / it is periurye / what so ever be sworn /
and blasphemithe Godesname. As all those that swear to pleace / and flater the
superior powers / when they make ungodly laws. And those that swear / in the
laws of men under the pretense of holy church / and persequute christ's /
true members.

As for those that be commune swerers / and be suffryd to blaspheme / with out
punishment / it is so ahhominable that the magistrates / they that swear / and
all the commune wealth Were as the dwell / shall at lenghe smart for it.
Regulus the Romayne and the Sagumines / shamythe Christyane men: that would not
for any pain or punishment of the worold / violat / or break there oath /
made by there false Gods of whom wrytythe / Saint Augustine libro de Ciuita.
Dei. 22. capit. 6. libro 1. capit. 15. Cicero lib De officijs 3. Valerius libro
9. The Saguntines burnyd them selfs. Regulus returnyd from his natyue country
/ and Cite of Rome / to his most cruelle Ennymies in Africa. and would rather
suffer thextreme tyranny of his ennymyes / then violat / or break his oath /
that he had sworn.

Caput VII. The fourth Commandment.
Remember to sanctifye the Sabbot day. Syx days thou shall labor / and do
all thy works. The seuenthe day is rest unto God thy lord / thou shall do no
work (in it) nether thy son / nether thy dowghter / thy servant / nor thy
maid / nether thy best / nether the Stranger that is within thy doors. For in
syx days / God made Heaven and Earth / the Sea / and all things that is
therein / and the seuenthe day restid: therefore blissyd God the seuenthe day /
and sanctified it.
THe cause / and end / why this commandment was institutyd / is diverse.
First because man should upon this day call his intendement / and thowghtes
from the lustis / pleasures / vanites / an concupiscens of the worold unto the
meditacions of godd / and his works / to the study of scripture heri^g of the
word of god / to call upon God with ardent prayer / to use and exercise the
Sacraments of God / to conferr / and give according to his abilite almose / to
the confortyng of the pour. Then like wyce God by this commandment prouidy
the for the temporal / and Civil liefe of man / and like wyce for all things
that be necessary and expedient for man / in this liefe. if man / and best /
that is man's servant / should without repose / and rest / allwaies labor /
they might never endure / the travel / of the Earth. God therefore / as he that
intendithe the conservation / and wealth of man / and the thing created to
man's use / commaundithe this rest / and repose from labor that his creatures
may endure / and serve as well there own necessary affayrs / and busynis /
as preserve the vthe / and offrynge of man and best / till it com to a
sufficient ayge and convenient forse / to supply the place / and rome of
souche as death / or diseace shall pryuate / or disable / from the execution /
and use of souche trauelles as this careful liefe shall necessaryly require.
So says Ovid. Quod caret alterna requie, durabile non est. That is to say.
the thing cannot endure / that lakythe rest. That man and best therefore / might
brethe and have repose / this sabbothe was institutyd. Not only that the body
should be restoryd unto strenghte and made able to sustain the trauelles / of
the weke to cum / but also that the soul and sprit of man / whiles the body is
at rest / might / upon the Sabbothe / learn and know / so the blyssid will of
his maker. that only / it leave not from the labor / and aduersite of sin:
but also by Gods grace / receive souche strenghe / and forse in the
contemplation of Gods most merciful promise / that it may be able / to
sustain all the trobles of temptacion / in the weke that folowithe. for as the
body being always oppressyd with labor lostythe his strenghe / and so
peryshythe: so doothe the mind of man / opprossyd with the cures / and
pleasures of this worold / loost all here forse / lust / and desire that she
had to the rest to cum of eternal liefe. And so dyethe not only the death of
sin / but hastythe what she can / to hate / and abhor all vertewe. allmyghty
God therefore not only in his commendementes / but also at the first creation of
the worold / sanctified the seuenthe day / Gene. 2. that is to say / apoyntyd
it to an holy use. or separatyd it from other days / wherein men travel in
the busynes of this worold. So is the meaning of this Ebrew phrase / or manner
of speech / as ye may read Iosuah 20. Capi. Sanctificauerunt Kades in Galilea.
That is to say / they sanctified Kades in Galilea. it is asmouche to say in
English / they chose / or apoyntyd the City of Kades / to be a refuge / or
sanctuary for Murderers to be saufe there / till the cause of the murderer
might be known. How be it / ye may not think that God gave any more holynys /
to the Sabbath then to the other days. For if ye consider friday / and Saturn
day / Saturn day / or Sunday in asmouche as they be days / and the work of
God / the one is no more holy / then the other / Cod. lib. 3. Tit. 12. de
Ferijs. but that day is always most holy / in the which we most apply /
and give our selfs unto holy works. To that end he sanctified the Sabbath
day. not that we should give our selfs to ylnis / or souche Ethnicall pastyme
as is now vsyd among Chrystyane people. But being fre that day from the
trauelles of this worold / we might consider the works / and benefits of God
with thanks yeuyng. Here the word / and law of God. honor him / and fere him.
then to learn / who / and where be the pour of Christ / our brothers in
necessite that wantythe our healpe. The observation therefore of the Sabbath /
doothe extend as well unto the faith we have in God / as unto the cherite of
our neighbor. And not only that / but also unto the bestes / that travel in
our busynys / and be our necessary servants. The which we should in no wyce
abuse / not only for there labors sake but also / for the love of him / that
has commendyd them / unto our service / almighty God. Thyrdly the sabbath
hither unto from the beginning of the worold / was / and is a type / and figure
of the eternal / and ever lastyng rest / that is to com. as S. Paul
diligently shewythe in the Epistole to the Ebrews cap. 4. so does. S. Aug.
lib. 11. cap. 31. de Ciuit. Souche as beliuyd the promise of God / declared by
Moses / were led by losuah the prince / in to Palestina and restyd in Chana an:
souche as hyre the word of God / and obeythe it / shall be caryd into the
celestial heuens / by Jesus Christ / and rest in eternal joy. Read
diligently that chapter / and thou shall find a very necessary doctrine /
what is the cause that the most part of men / enter not into this eternal
rest. The contempt of our capitaynes words Jesus Christ / who would led us
thither / halyd we not back / and left not his commandments. Consider the
persons rehersyd in this commandment. Thy son / thy dawghter / thy man
servant / and thy woman servant / thy best / and the stranger within thy
dowres. those thou must not with out necessite constrayne to any servile work
upon the sabbothe. but se that they exercise them selfs upon the sabbothe / in
hering the word of god. and se they frequent / the place of commune prayers /
and uses sacraments / as God commaundithe. Ffor those God has co^maundyd
unto thy charge / as long as they be with the. not only that thou give them
there wagis that is dew: but also se them aright instructyd in the law of God /
and live there after. for if they peryshe by thy negligence / there blud shall
be requirid at thy hand. the stranger like wyce within thy port / thowghe he be
of an other religion: thou should assay to win him unto the knolege / and
rites of thy religion / as thou seyst here commaundyd unto the Israelitis / and
consequently unto us all. for wear bound no lease / but rather more then they
/ to the love of God / and our neighbor. and by express words / commau^did
to do the same Mat. 22. Iac. 5. Here let us all cry out / and say (peccauimus)
we have offendid / and study to amend. for there is here condemnid / the
Avarice of all men / that care not for God / nor his law a dele: but vsithe
ungodly / and vncheritable there servants / and bestes / as thowghe they were
made only of God / to serve his auaricious appetis / and not rather to serve
the necessaris of there Masters: and like wice to glorify god / as his word
commaundithe. like wice in this commandment is condemnid our vncheritable
behauour / to wards our neighbor. and like wice the ungodly / and carnal
fere / that we have to teach astranger the knolege of God. we give him the
thing we owe him not saving by the law of nature. And the thing that he may
well lack / or else obtain of an other. A supper / or denyr for his money / or
love. And never make mencyon of the thing we owe him in asmouche as we be
Chrystianes. thus can Aristotell intret his gestes / and Plato give his alms.
our office is / to communycat the knolege of God with him / so to move a
communycation / that the one might know the others faith. but this Cherite /
and Hospitalite / is vsyd but of few men. Incase a man should make mencyon of
any souche almose / or intrete any place of the scripture at dinner / or supper
/ it were a cloyng of the stomach / and taking away of the appetyt / a nyle
saueryd mess / and the warst dysshe that can be browght to the table. men say
that folk should be merry at the table / and let the peracher talk of scripture
as thowghe the law of God made men sorry / which conteynithe not only the
solace / and loy of man / in this worold / but also in time to cum for ever.
God take out of the hearts of men / all fere and shame / that we frelye
confess him / as occasion shall be yeuen with Looth / Genes. 19 cap. that sat
in the gates of Sodoma to inuitat the strangers that came to the city into his
own house to keep them in vertew / and preserve them from vice. Read the
chapter and se where in consyttythe true hospitalite farther thou seyst by
this commandment that the Israelites might constrain the the strangers
within there citeis / to hire and see there religion upon the sabbothe / as
every well orderyd commune wealth / now in the time of the gospel should do
the same / and constrayne all people to hyre the word of God / and se the
mynistration of there sacraments. This day is apoyntid also for man / to
consider / and expend the works of God the which he made in syx days. for
the least creature that God made shall teach man a knolege of the creator / if
it be consideryd accordynglie. So that man should not only use them / but also
give God thanks for them / to augment faith / corroborat hope / and provoke
love. Therefore / God blessed the sabbath* to say / made it honorable /
sanctified it / apointid it to an holy use / gave it certain pryuilegis / and
would men to be / that day holy. Ffor as he has appointid syx days for us
to exerci^e our selfs in the business / and trauelles of the worold: so has
he appoyntid the seuenthe to exercise the Ceremonies of the church / which ar
insty^udid for the preservation of the Ministry of the church As to use
comume prayer / here the sermon / use the blyssyd supper of the lord / and to
give alms / 1. Cor. 1^.14.16. althowghe the Ceremony of the Sabbath be taken
away Col. 2. which appertaynyd only unto the people / and commune wealth of
the Ebrews / yet one day of the weak / to preserve / and use the word of God
/ and his sacrame^teo / is not abrogatid. therefore in this commandment / ar
too things to be obseruyd. The one ceremonial / during for the time: the
other Moral / and never to be abolyshid / as long as the church of Christ
shall contynew / upon the Earth. The patriarchs before the law / Gene. 2. the
prophets in the time of the law / Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. 5. we being delyueryd from
the damnation of the law / 1. Cor. 16. have one day / to rest from labor /
and apply our selfs to the works of the sprit / which secreatlie in our
selfs / should be do^ne every day / with our ha^die labor / apo^the Sondaie
openly without the labor of our hands. This Sunday that we observe / is not
the commandment of man as many say / that would under the pretense of this
one law / bynd the churge of Christ to all other laws / that men has
ungodly prescribyd unto the church. But it is / by express words commaundyd
/ that we should observe this day (the Sunday) for our Sabbath / as the words
of S. Paul declarythe / 1. Cor. 16. commanding every man to appoint his alms
for the pour / in the Sunday. The text says in one of the sabbath. It is an
Ebrew frace / and is asmouche to say / as in the Sunday. As ye may read the
same manner of speech / Luce. 24. and Joan. 20. of the women that came / to the
sepulcher / to anoint the ded body of Christ. Luke says / in one of the
Sabbath / erly they came to the Sepulcher / and so says John / by the same
words. the which was the sunday / as noman dowtithe. for it is our faith /
that christ rose the third day. So may ye read / Gene. 1. where the text
says. it was euenyng / and it was morning / one dayt that is to say the first
day / Which we call the sunday. and thus also says those that were best
lernyd in the tongues among Christian writers. Joan. Chrysostom. Lactant. and
Erasmus. for the preservation of the true meaning of the word of God / and
right use of his blessed Sacraments / he has yeuyn unto the church
Apostelles / Prophets / Pastors / Doctors / and other / Ephesians. 4. That should
teach us the Scripture / and wrytynges of the Prophets and Apostelles /
which was declarid to be true / with many signs / and tokens / that we should
not waver with every wynd / and be caryd into errors by the doctrine of man.
That we should not feign new doctrine / out of our own brains / but belyue as
the holy church of the Patriarchs / Prophets / Christ / and the Apostelles
which tawght the people as they wrote / and wrote as they tawght / that noman
after there death / should deceive the people / that Christ redemyd with his
precious blud / with false / and impostorous doctrine. Those Ethnyck and
Iewyshe doctors of the Pope / how so ever the Bragg of the Name of holy
church / be none other then the defenders of the Synagoge of Antechrist.

Sure we be that Christ / the Patriarchs / Prophets and Apostelles be sauyd.
and belyuyd no more / nor none other wyce / then they have left unto us by
writings. Better it is to be certain of our doctrine / and salvation with
this holy church / then to associat our selfs with the rabull of liars. that
bostythe / and braggythe there abominable / and Ethnicall ceremonies / which
be condemnyd in the scripture / to be laws for the holy church. God give the
grace to read the holy Bible / and to have a little understanding of it / then
shall thou se who / and where is / the holy church / that these dreamers /
attribute unto there father the devil / and Antechrist of Rome. And if they
say unto the / that thou must not take the text / after thy own mind / but
after the mind of the holy Doctors / that has wroten in the scripture:
thynck with thy self / that God has yeuen the / the Scripture to read
therein / to thy suluation / as well / as unto the Doctor. Farther that thy
Doctor preach not alie / for the truithe: god has yeue^ the / the scripture
to judge thy Bishope / doctor / preacher / and curate whether he preach gall /
or honey / his own laws or Gods laws. Farther say boldly / and fere not /
for it is true / that in matters / and causes of wayght / the doctors agree not /
one with the other. No many times / not with them selfs / as every man
knowithe / that has read them / with judgment. and as godd Arguments shall
thou find in them / to disprove / as to prove / the things that this late
found Catholic church of the devil / would stablyshe. Again thinck which
was the most pure church / and fre from heresis. The church before the
Doctors wrote / that only was tawght by the simple text / and words of the
Apostelles / or the churge that has been tawght this many yers by the blind
doctrine of men. the^ thou shall se that those doctors that they speak of
has put out gods laws and browght in there own. as the pharisees and
Rabbis did in the old church. be not afraid of there holy name / but trust to
he holinis of scripture / the^ shall tho not be deceauid. they say the holy
church most be hard / and obeide: true it is. but our faith is not groundid
upon those / that be of the church thowghe they be the true ministres of Gods
word. but upon the word it self as it aperithe. Mat. 16. therefore when the
auctorite or testimone of the church / is alegyd: man that louythe his
salvation / must sarche where / and what the church is: what times / and when
/ the writers were most sincere / and not belyue these yesterdayes birds /
that sing as the Papegay they know not what: as they be tawght out of a
shamelis scole / that began with murder / is mayntaynyd with sacrileige /
and shall be destroide with the clertye / and brightnis of the Sone of man /
cumming to judgment.

In appertainithe unto no man / in what auctorite so ever he be: to judge who
preachithe false / or who true / but unto the word of god only which
i^terpretatithe it self / when it is with judgment co^ferrid. But of this /
his requirid amore prolix work: which God shall give in time.

Now the works of this precept / be also these Godly to preach his word / and
to use the sacraments as the reachithe in his word. to hire the^ reverently
that trewly preachithe. To honor the word of God / and help to the preferment
there of asmouche as may be. to succor the professors thereof which be / has
bin and ever shall be (if they preach trewly) in the most miserable condition
of the worold. Matthew. 10. Luc. 21. Mar. 13. Io. 15.16. To neglect the preaching
of gods word / as these do that look for the flyse / and care not for the
shipe. To abolishe the preaching of the word / As those do / that has browgte
into the church Massing / and Mumling of canonical hours (as they call the^)
which nether they / that say them / nether those that here them / onder
stondithe not. they say god vnderstondithe them. what then? so he
vnderstandithe like wyce the cucko / and the lowyng of the cow. which is as
godd / and better prease unto god / the^ the supersticious / and vnknowin
prayer that thou mu^melist. for they use the yeffte that god has yeue^ the^ /
to sound an unknown voice. and thou abusist the yeft of god / which gave the
a tongue / to edify thy self / and thy negbowr / like wice to preach the lord
omnipotent. But thou makist thy tongue / an instrument to speak thou wotest not
what. when thou sholdist cry for mercy / and say: Sana anima^ mea^, quia
peccaui tibi. that is to say: lord hele my solle / for I have offen did the.
Thou say: Custo diui uias dn^i, necimpie gessi a^ Deo meo. That is to say: I
have kept the ways of the lord / and have not departid by iniquite / from my
God. Thus the Psalms / and books of the sceipture / thou redist with out
judgment / and knowist not / what psalm is mete for thy necessite / and state
of the people that be present / no more the^ he that never saw the scripture.
Yea sometime thou redist a false history / and either thou attributist the honor
dew to god unto the saint thou worshippist / or honorist him in the earth /
who is solle perauenture is in hell. For Augustine so says / that all be not
glorified solles with God / who is relics me^ worshipp in the earth.

To teach false doctrine / is a work against this commandment. like wysse to
deprauate the use / of the sacraments / other wysse the^ they be tawght in the
scripture is against this commandment. to use them to an other end / then
they were institutyd. To honor them as they do / that inchau^t the water of
the font / and chafe it with many a suspire / and deep fet brethe. souche as
honor the bred / and win which the scripture doothe not only teach / to
roman in there substa^ciall essence / and nature / with out changyng / but
al so the reason / and all the wyttis of man. farther the bestes of the earth /
fowls of the air / and fishis of the water / knowithe there is no change of
bred / nor win. and barythe record that the scripture is true. bred to
remain bred / and wine wine / 1. Cor. 10.11. farther to augment the ceremonies
of the church / and bring in a new Iudaisme and Aaronicall rites / is against
this commandment. as the Bishopes has vsyd the matter / there be more
ceremonies in the church of Christ / the^ were in the church of the Jews /
as it shall easily apere to him that will co^fer our church with the books
of Mofes. Seneca in his book contra superstitiones / reprehendid the rites of
the Jews / and cheffely the sanctifyyng of the Sabbath. what would he say if he
saw / our churges that have not the ceremonijs co^mau^did by god / but by man /
to the dishonoring of god. to neglect a cheritable deed to our neighbowr upon
the sabbath day / is to breeke the sabbath / Ma. 12. Lu. 6.13. not to cease
from doi^g of i will / but to abuse the rest / and eace of the sabbothe / in
sporties / games / and pastimes / keeping of merkettes / and feres upon the
sabbothe is to abuse the sabbothe. it is asmouche as to fery unto god / and
work to the devil. for specially all vnlafulle plays / and sportes be vsyd
upon that day. It is against this co^mu^deme^t to keep / or dedicate any fest
to any saint of what holinis so ever he be. therefore says the law ye shall
celebrat the fest unto the lord Exo. 23. this honor should be given only unto
god in the old testament was no fest ever dedicatid unto any saint / nether in
the new. it happened aftee the dathe of the Apostelles / as it is wroten in
Euse. Eccl. Hist. li. 4. ca. 15. and better auctorite have they not / that be
the auctors of these holy days / the which the co^sell of lugd. has yeue^
us. they have not above 273. yers in aige. and is the leuyn of the Pope. in
Trip. hist. li. 9. ca. 38. there is no mention of saints holy days. few of
S. Hier. i^ 4. ca. ad Gal. and likewice of S. Aug. ad Ianu. 118. epi. The
sunday / and the hours the rofapoi^tid for a dece^t ord / to preach the word
of god / use the sacraments / to have co^mu^e prayers / to provide for the
pore / is to be obseruid: that all things may be don in order. 1. Cor. 14.
asfor the other laws that they have made / concerning fasting / and
satisfaction for sin / and would defend them under the pretense / and title
of mortification of the flesh: that gloss seruithe not for there purpose. But
there / hypacrisie laythe wait / to destroy the true doctrine of Christ / if
it be not auoydid. They teach nether what mortification is / nether how the
flesh may be best kept under / to obey the sprit. Mortification signifythe /
either patienc / which god requirithe in the time of aduersite: other
temperaunce commaundid of God / to refrain the lusts / and co^cupiscens that
fihtithe against the sprit. it signifiethe not souche volu^tarie fastis /
celebrating of masses / or any souche other doings of superstitious ceremonis
as man chosithe to do / without the commandment of God. of patience under the
cross / and of aduersite saint Paul speakithe 2. Cor. 4. we / allwaies says
he / bare about with us the mortificatio^ of the lord Jesus in the body / to
that end / that the lief of Jesus / may be manifestyd i^ the body. And in the
same place / allwaies we that beleui^g for the love of Jesus / ar deliuerid to
death / that the lief of Jesus / might apere i^ our mortal flesh. this
callithe S. P. Mortification / that is like unto the the afflictions of Christ
/ and spekythe of the same / Roma. 12. and David Psalm. 50. Mich. 7. of
temperaunce / and sobriety in meat / drink / and all other things / it is
wroten Luc. 22. be ware your hearts be not oppressyd with glotony / and
dronkynnis. Mat. 17. these kind of sprites / be not cast out / but with fasting
/ and prayng. like wice Ephe. 6. whether we speak of patience in aduersite / or
temperancy in felicite / boothe these be works commaundyd of God. and it is
lawful for every man to chose for him self souche exercises as best be
convenient to his own ayge and condition of his body. therefore Paul says 1.
Cor. 9. I chaste my body / and bring it into servitude. to this end / that
intemperancie lettid not the holy ghost / with drawid not his mind from prayer /
made him not unapt to study / and to the uocation he was apointyd unto. This
is thend / why we should do these works / not to merit our reconciliation for
sin / but to labor against the devil / the worold / sin / and the flesh
with the holy ghost / to preserve our selfs in the favor of God.
Temperancie is in general commendid unto al men / and all times / how be it
not one manner of exercise / in this vertew / can be appointyd for all men. but
every man / may chose for him self / what exercise he listithe / and is most
convenient / for his diseace. souche as be passyd in aige / and with cures of
this worold: has loost the stre^ghe of there bodies / nedith not so great
abstinence from metes / and drinks: as these that be young / and in the myddis
of there strenghe. As we may se / in one man Dauyd / that nedyd more exercyses
before he was put into Exile / then after. When scarce could the bones / bare
about the weak body / that was far broken / with the trobles / and care of
this worold. Heal^he is the great gift of God / Deuter. 28. and feryst bewty
of man or woman Arist. lib. Rhethori. therefore it must not be hurt / nether
with over mouche abstynence / nether with dissolute living. would to God
people would follow the scripture in this mortification / then the worold would
amend doutles. but there is now nothing / but a carnal liberty of the gospel
/ which hyndrethe mouche the glory of God.

The pain of souche as violate this commandment / and doothe any vile work
with out necessite / is wroten Number. 15. that he should be stonyd to death.

Thus I have rudely opened the first table of the ten words that conteynythe
iiij. commandments. The which division doothe Joseph. antiq. lib. 6. cap.
3. Origin. Homil. in Eyod. 8. Ambros. in 6. cap. Epist. ad Ephe. August. lib.
3. ad Bonefac. aproue. In his Quest. in Exodus quest. 71. he Numbrythe but 3. in
the fyst. and 7. in the next table / by reason of a certain Allegory. and him
doothe the Master of the Sentence follow lib. 3. Distinct. 40. How be it / the
first Division is true / as the Text in Exodus 20. is plain. Whereas the Tenthe
commandment / Thou shall not covet / is but one commandment / as I have
diligently sharchyd / all the edicyons that we have in the Ebrew tongue. With
one punct / periode / and sentence he concludithe the hole tenthe commandment
/ which many men deeuyd into too. Thou shall not covet thy Neighbors house.
that is one with them. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors wief / is an other.
But the text declarythe manifestlye / that it is but one. for all is
comprehendid with in one and under one sentence. In Deuteronomy. cap. 5. certain
later edicions makythe division of the text. but that is nothing to the
purpose. there Moses repetithe the words unto them that knew before the
division of the tables. farther the printers therein folowith the mind of one
Maymon an Ebrew / and not the orygynall in Exodus cap. 20. farther in the oldest
edicion / and prynt that I have seen (affar as I know there is none elder / if
there be / it is but one) the tenthe commandment in Deuteronomy. is not deuydyd the
which edicion venis gave unto us Anno 1494. Ffarther onkelos the Caldey
interpretour in Deuteronomy. makythe but one commandment of the Tenthe. I wounder
that some / which be not ignorant of the tongues / follow not the truythe of
the text: but makythe the commandment that forbiddithe ymagis: a precept
ceremonial. so I might say / this were also Ceremonial. Thou shall have no
strange Gods before my face. for all the commandments be of one vertew /
and strenghe. if the one may be in effect Ceremonial / so may the other. but
these opinions I pass over at this time.

The second table.
Caput VIII.
HOnor thy father and mother / that thou may have long liefe in the la^d that
the lord / thy God shall give unto the.
AS in the first Table ar comprehendyd all the works / that apertayne unto
souche religion / and honor / as belongithe only unto god / as in the first
precept / knolege / fere / faith / and love of God. In the second is for bid
all external Idolatry. In the third External profession of Gods name / his
word / and his works. as by prayer / thanks yeuing / preaching / and
confessing his trewthe before the worold. In the fourth: how we should Honor
him with public Sacraments / and ceremonies in the church. so in this
Second table / is comprehendyd all souche works as apertayne unto God / and
man. and in this table is prescribyd how / and by what means / one man may
live with an other in peace and unite / in this Civil liefe / during the time
/ of this mortal body / upon the Earth.

Many Noble wyttis has applied great diligence / and study / to prescribe
souche laws as might best / and most commodiouslie govern and keep the
people / in a politic felicite. To live quietlye / prosperously / and
wealthelie. as ligurcus the Lacedaemonians / Solon / Plato / Aristotell / the
Grekis. Numa Pomp. Cicero / and other / the Romans. Amongst Christianes /
Constant. Justin. and other. Those men has do^ne somewhat / to assotiat people
in Cites / and Realms by wysdom / to keep them in an honest order with
vertewse laws / and to remove the occasion of vice / and discord by justice.

How be it none of themall / nor all they to gather / has not prescribyd so
perfet / and absolute a form of a politic wealth / as allmyghtie God has
done unto his people in this Second table / and syx rules. Nether so equally
ponderyd the diversity of sin / and transgression of justice as this law
doothe. not so indifferently prescribe the correction and punyshement according
to the grauite and greatnis of the fault but is to cruel in the less offense
/ and to merciful in the greater. As ye may se the injuries of thefft punyshyd
/ and blasphemy of God / with adultery vnpunyshyd.

After that he had gathered togather this people into one company and multitude
/ browght them out of Egypt / and apoyntyd them a land and cites / where they
should live / as members of one commune wealth. He prescribyd unto them /
certain laws / without the which / no commune wealth / can long endure. for
it is no lease maiestre to keep a Royalme in wealth / from the dangers to cum:
the^ to win it from aduersite / when aduersiteis present. The first law / to
preserve a common wealth is / that the people thereof / know how to reverence
/ and honor God a right who is the president / and the defender of all cites /
and realms. If he be neglectid / therfolowithe doutlis aruine, and change of
the common wealth. Thus saw all those that wrote laws / for the preservation
there of not only Moses / and christian wyiters / but also the Ethnykes.
Arist. li. 7. polit. ca. 8. Where as he Nu^brythe the works to be do^ne in the
cite. Quintu^, inquit, acprimu^ circa aram diuinam, cultus quod sacrificium
uocant, that is to say. the fyghe and principal work / is religion at the
altar of God. which me^ call sacrifyce. They knew / that no cite / nor Realm
could contynew long in wealth / except they had the favor of God thowghe they
could not tell / how to honor him a right. We like wyce know the same. the
favor of God / first and chefely to preserve the commune wealth Psalm. 127.
Deuteronomy. 31. and be assuryd by his word how we may honor him / to say as it is
towght us / in the first table / and four first precepts.

The second law Necessary for every commune wealth is / that the people among
them selves live in peace / and concord with out discord / and dissencyon. As
Sallust. says / Little things by concord incressethe / and great things by
discord decresse. that saw the pore shepord Melibeus in Virg. when he said: En
quo discordia ciues perduxit miseros? that is to say. lo whether (or into what
miseris) has discord browght the wrecchid citicens. Not only Rome / and
other most noble co^mne wealths / lost there libertes / and the^ selfs by
discord / but also the common wealth of the Israelites as ye may read 3. Re.
12. how of one kingdom / was made too for the discord / that god suffryd to be
among the^ selfs for the idolatry of king Solomon 3. Re. 11. where as ye have
a^ example that no commune wealth / can endure where as the precepts of the
first table be neglectyd. Allmyeghty God therefore / after that he has tawght
the people / what is to be don toward him in the first table: he shewythe in
the Second table / what we should do one / to the other of us. that peace / and
concord might be among us. Which cannot be / where as one knoythe not / what
reverence / and honor should be don to the other. for where as all men will be
like / there is nether wealth / ner vertew: but contencyon / and hatred /
which is the matter / and ground / of all calamites / and myscheffe. The law of
God therefore / in the first front of this Second table / doothe apoynt / and
institute a certain Imperie / and dominion / to be had among his people that
one person might be known from the other. Conmaundithe obedience unto the
superoure powers / Sayng / Magnify or reverence thy father / and mother. if
this order be kept / there is a reward apoyntid for the observation thereof / as
the text says. thou shall live long upon the earth. after that people of a
commune wealth / know / each of them there dewtes: it is necessary / there
follow a law to mayntaine them in peace / and unite. therefore folowithe it / in
the table. Thou shall not kylle / which precept is / amunicion / and defense
of the peace. How beit because there folowithe alteracyon / and change in every
common wealth / by reason of death / and the persons present cannot live
for ever: the law maker for the commune wealth / must provide / how the places
of those that die / may be again furnishid / that with the departure / of one
/ may follow the success of an other. wherefore god puttithe the syxt cano^ /
that defe^dithe marriage whereby is preseruid this common wealth and as godly
continewid as it began. the which law is not only necessary for the
preservation of the common wealth to cu^: but also to preserve the state
present / in peace / and tranquillite. for never was there greater occasion of
discord / and bate / between common wealth / and come wealth / prince / and
prince / private persons / and private persons: the^ for thabuse and
violating of marriage / and committing fornication / with souche like vices as
it is to be seen by Dina / Genesis 34. by Thamar 2. Reg. 13. by the pristes wief
abusyd of the Reniamites Iudicu^. 9.20. read the place. for the rapt of Helena
Troie perishid. for the oppressing of Lucrece at Rome and other. Then as there
be laws to preserve the persons thelfe of the common wealth so must there
be laws to preserve souche gods as appertain unto the me^bres of the
common wealth. that one do no wro^ges unto the other but every man be content
with his own co^dicio^ and propre gods and nor to usurp auctorite over his
neigbowrs. thefore the Eight law is conserning the defense of propre and
private Gods. Thou shall do no theffte. How be it / seeing we are frail and so
i will that many times / we transgtesse / sum / or all these laws that
preseruithe the common wealth it is necessary to find and prepare some
remedy to have the transgressour punishid and the person that is hurt and
offendid restorid unto his right. therefore is there this clause and rule i^ the
law. Thou shall give no false testimony against thy neighbor: which is the
Ninthe commandment. and bidithe as well the superior powers to se equity and
justice with out respect of persons as the cause requirithe obseruyd / as
souche shall be testimonies in a dutfull matter to say as they know trewlie. And
likewyce that in bying and sellyng and in all other contractes me^ use no
fraud to got there gods. these laws now I will opi^ in order as they
standithe plainly and simple as I ca^: to the vndersto^ding of the text. as
for the the^the law I will speak of severally. these be the fo^tayns and
original of all politic laws. The first law that stablishithe the auctorite
of the superior powers begni^ithe with the name of the father and mother. for
after and next unto god we awe most reverence unto the^ / of who^ we have
receauid this natural liefe by the help of God / and they likewice has
susteinid the pains of our education and bringing up. the^ under the name of
the parents is co^cludid all other persons to who^ we awe our obedience and
love. As the country were we were born or were we have our living that we be
true and faithful un unto it Garnyshe it what we may and inryche it with all
godly knolege / arts and other commodites. not to hurt it but to die for it
as justice shall require. The^ the Prince / or magistrate that has the defense
of the country and the people of the same co^mittid unto his charge. Tutors
apointid for vthe / souche as teachithe any cranffte or ha^di means to live
by. The doctors and teachers in the ministry of the church who^ the
scripture callithe the father of the people / 1. Co. 4. Then souche as be by
nature and pare^taige our kind^ folk. also all that be our elders unto whom
we awe obedience. These be the persons that be understand by the father and the
mother. The text says that I should honor the^. the which word i^ the Ebrew
has a greater energie and strenghe the^ one word in latyne or English can
express (Cabad) signifythe to set mouche by / to have in estimation / to
prefer and extol: and requirithe these affections in the heart / and not only
external reverence as be fere words / outworde gestures without the love of
the heart. To obey them in all things honest agreyng with the law of God. not
contemn them / neglect them / hate them / or be unkind to them. To help them
as we be able if necessite require. To put our lives for them and to pay them
there dew. To. 13. and that without murmur and grugge. For all those that I
have rehersid be as our fathers / and at is were a second God apointid for us
upon the earth. Therefore se if thou will have a very true ymayge to express god
omnipote^t thy sole god and maker / unto thy reason and external se^ses: set
those superior poures before thin Iye / which has or do the travel for
thy wealth and commodite. thy father and mother as is before said. The prince
and King how to keep the in thy nawne country in wealth and felicite / that
thou be not made prisoner nor bound man to astrainge nation / thy contraries /
and thy mortal Ennimyes. The land it self bryngythe the fruit and all things
necessary for thy lief the which thy fathers wan with there bludd / and
maynteinid with there body and gods. Thy preacher tellythe the will of God
and all his study is to bring the to eternal felicite unto those tho awist of
dewty a filial reverence and honor. To thy father Exo. 20. Deu. 5. Prouer. 10.

was obseruid also amang the gentilles as iuuenal the Poet says thowght it
that afaut worthy death if the yo^ger honorid not the elder. As for the
defense of the country it was and is of all natutall men that there nedithe /
nor testimonij nor Example Moses / Deu. 20. The profane writers as Horace
thus: Dulce and decorum pro patria mori. That is to say. it is sweet / and
decent to die for the country. The Lacedemo^ that were slain in Termin. had
this Epitaphe one there graves.

Hospes dic Sparte nos te hic uidisse iacentes,
Dum patrie sanctis legibus obsequimur.
Thou stranger say that thou sawyst us hyreded whiles we obeid the holy laws
of our country. as for our honor and reverence to souche as teach us the
word of God it is showed / and also the Examples of the corynthions and life
wyce of the Galathiens that were so prompt to obey Paul before they were
seducyd that they would have pluckyd out there own Iyes to have done Paul
honor Galat. Valerius Maximus libro 2. capit. 1. How in Rome the elders were
allwaies taken as fathers of the younger and that no vthe should sit at any fest
/ till there elders had place. they should be the last that sat and the first
that rise from the table. Every man should reverence and honor these superior
powers not for fere / but for love and consider that God begynnythe not this
second table with the dominion and imperye of the father in vain or with out
cause. But menithe that we should none othere wyce love the superiore powers of
the earth and be affeccionatyd unto them then unto our natural parents and
obey the^ in all things that is consonant or not against the law of god like
wyce the superior poures should be none other wyce affection with love toward
there subjects the^ the father is against the son. Consider the work and
ordinance of God in this superiorite and dominion that preseruithe the godd /
punishithe the i will / auau^sithe vertew / and oppressithe vice / to the
preservation and wealth of the. Republic. Thine office is to consider in what
place the superior is set / and how the devil trauelythe with out ceassing to
troble the tra^quillite / peace / and godd order of every common wralthe / by
sedicio^ / traison war and lasciuous / and dissolute manner of living. farther
he laborythe co^tinewlye to subvert the prince and gouerner thereof / to bring
him from vertew to vice. that they may boothe with ungodly laws / and i will
example peruerte the people / and bring them from God. As thou may se by
David and Saul too verteewes and godly kings at the beginning of there reign.
Saul he utterly loost in this worold / and in the worold to ^u^. He so
intricatid and wrappid David in the snares of sin. that scarce could he fend
his color / and return to grace. Mark how he did dare and blind Solomon the
wysist that ever raygnyd and browght him to idolatry. Remember that they that
Rule be men and has like wice there infirmites and with out a singular grace
ca^ not govern well. as Solomon says: ut oculus uideat, and auris audiat,
Deus facit utrumque, that is to say / that the Iye se / and the Ere hyre / God
yenithe boothe. the meaning of the wiche text is. that if the Magistrate have
good counsel and se what is best for the commune wealth / and the people obey
it / it be the works of god. no humane sapience / diligence / and industry is
sufficient for this vocation therefore Paul says 2. Cor. 3. our abilite and
sufficiency is of god. when we have co^siderid the malice of the devil
against souche as rule in the worold and likewice the rulers propre infirmites
the^ let us consider likewice our own sins / and nawghtie liffe for the
punishment where of God yeuithe many times cruel / and ungodly gouerners: Job.
35. as he yenithe good / wise / and loving princis / to souche as fere his name
/ 2. Para. 9. if they happen to fall from god and follow vice / it is not thy
dewty straight way to ca^lu^niat / speak / move sedicio^ / cast of obedience /
love / and fere that thou a wist unto the^ but prai for the^: study what thou
can to call the^ agai^e to god / be prone to for got and remitt thoffence /
remember Sau. and Sal. that fell and yet returnid disse^ble at souche fa^tes as
be curable lest the public peace be troblid. remember thowghe he be nawght
that rulithe the place and office that he is in / is the order and work of God
/ so if thou put difference between the office it self which is good / and
the offycer that is i will / it shall keep the in afere that thou reverence a godd
and godly governance in a nyle gouerner. As Paul louyd the polycie and laws
of Rome and never tawght sedicion / thowghe he hatyd Caligula / and Nero
themperours that ocopied the imperye and dominion. Beware therefore of
contumacie and disobedience against the superior powers obey them in all
things where they command the nothing against Gods laws. so commaundithe
Paul Ephe. 6. for they are apointid unto that place of governance to be Gods
Vycars / to execuet his law / his will / his pleasure / to bring men to god /
and not to carimen from god / for in case they instigat there subjects to the
transgressio^ of gods laws / we must obey nether them nether there laws /
they be not then our fathers but rather strangers that would drw us from the
obedience of God which is our very father. It is not decent that there
auctorite should be above and Gods auctorite under. for as man's auctorite
dependithe of Gods / so should it bring me^ and led men to God. Where as they
command nothing against Gods law: thou have hard before what reverence thou
owist unto the^. A thing more unnatural is there not / then to sethe son
dishonor the father / the subject his superior. As we lern not only by the
scripture but also by the examples / of all other bestes of the ertht / and
fowls of the air except a few. therefore the book of Job sendithe us unto
them to lern wysdo^ cap. 12. So doothe Plin. lib. 8. cap. 27. Not. hist. show
what wisdom the bestes of the earth has tawght man. Be not as the vipere
that gnawithe out the belly of here damme. and sekithe here own liefe / with
here dammes death. follow the nature of the Cicone that in here vthe norishithe
the old days of here parents Plin. lib. 10. cap. 23. Not. Hist. thus thou art
bound to do. if thou do it / thou shall have thy reward which is to live long
upon therthe. Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. 5. if thou do it not: be assuryd that God will
punish it / thowgh man do not Deu. 17. Eyod. 21. Proverb. 15. Romans 13. Read
the 35. chapter of Hier. the prophet. and mark how God punyshyd the children
of Israel for disobedience / and rewardyd the Rechabites for obedience of there
fathers will.

Now it is necessary to know the superiors deutye / first the fathers to the
son / then of others that bare rule in the worold.

The fathers office is to teach and bring up there children in the knolege
and discipline of God to know him aright / and keep them from wantenis and
ungodly liefe. Ephe. 6. Deuteronomy. 6. Exodus 21. not to provoke them to ire / but
gentle win them to vertew and love with out seuerite and rigure if fere
means can awaile. If not to / use rod and the punysheme^t as he sey the cause
require and not to be remiss / and negligent incorrectyng his chyldes faut /
another to wynk at his i will doings Proverb. 13. 23.10. Eccle. 30. read the
place. but alas how can this be done / where as the Parents themselves / can
scarce repet by heart the Articles of the faith / the pater noster / and ten
commandments. How can those miserable persons / teach there children the
meani^g of there beliffe / the vertew of prayer / the danger of sin / or
right use of the sacraments. This the worold o with / unto the Holy churge /
that is extollid in to the higher heavens / that has robbyd people not only
of the scripture in a known tongue but also preferrid unto the cure of solles /
souche as sing solle / fa / and can do nothing less / then the thing that
apertainithe to there office. Now what the Prince / and Magistrate should be:
what there office is toward there subjects / what is there reward if they
govern well: and what there pain if they do the contrary / it shall apere by
the scripture.

What the king should be it / is wroten / Deuteronomy. 17. and like wyce what things
the should do / or not do. if thou wilt says God unto the Israelites have a
king / thou shall take him that I-chose in the mids of thy boothers
(understand that now all kings / be they good / or bad or put in there
auctorite by god) thou ca^ste make no stranger king over the. in these words
is declared / that who so ever will govern a commune wealth aright / must love
it / and the members thereof / as the father his children. As Xenophon says /
a godd prince / differithe nothing / from a good father. Arist. lib.
Politicoru^ 5. ca. 9. shewithe many conditions that are necessarily requirid in
him / that should be preferryd to the governance of a commune wealth. The
first is / that he love it / and the state thereof. Thus requiryd like wyce
Christ in peter / when he commendyd the people unto his charge. Sayng peter
louyst thowme: yea lord said he / and that thou know. then Peter feed my
sheep Io. 21. He shall not profet in the regiment of the Civil wealth / nor
ecclesiastical / without a singular love unto the preservation thereof. The
King there / is for hyddyn to multiply horses / and to carry the people again
/ into Egypt: not that the king should have no horses / or permit none of his
subjects / if occasion requirid / to travel into Aegipt / but that he should
not glory in his own strenghe / and cause the people to trust in the might /
and pour of the flesh / as thowghe by man / there common wealth might be
preseruyd / or there Ennimies / so ever co^ in time of war / as Pharo / and
the Egyptians did. farther it is for bydden the king / to have many wiefes.
And the cause is / lest they should with draw his heart from god. Nether should
the king / multiply for himself / great abundaunce of gold / and silver* But
thus the king must do / when he raignythe in his kingdom. cause an Exampler of
Deu. be wrote^ out / and that book should be with him / and he to read therein
all the days of his liefe and learn to fere the lord / his God / and to
observe all the precepts thereof / and laws / to do them. Ffarther his heart
should not be lifft up / above his brothers and should not declyne from the
precepts of the book / nether to the left hand / nether to the right / that
he may prolong his days / in his raygne / he and his children in the mids of
Israel Deuteronomy. 17. The first cure and charge of the magistrate or prince must be /
to se there subjects instructyd in the first table / and the precepts thereof.
Which cannot be except they appoint lernyd / and convenient ministres in the
churge / that teach none other doctrine / then the Hole bible conteynythe.
Consernyng there office in Civil gouernaynce / it is describyd Psalm. 100. to
live well him self and to observe mercy and justice. to punyshe vice / and to
extol vertew. read that psalm. there shall thou se a princes office / his
liefe / and family describyd. How he should live after the word of God /
govern his people there by / what servants he should have in his curt / and
what persons should be banyskyd out the curt. to use the industry of souche as
be good / in public / and private busynes / as it is in the 6. verse. it may
happen Aprynce to have i will servants / extorsiners / pollers / pyllers /
oppressors of the pore / nor commodious for his maiesti / nor for the people of
his realm. Souche as live in illenys / blaspheme God / and can do none other
thing then devour / the bred of the pore. those David says in the Eight
verse / he will banisheout of his court.

In the nynthe / and last verse / he says / he will not only ryd his court /
of souche i will persons / but also daily give diligence / to purge / and cle^ce
all his realm of souche i will doers. The princes that has this study to
maintain the glory of God / and to preserve justice / and equite / if by
infirmites they fall so^tymes: must be born with all / and there faults
otherehidd / or helid* As it is to be seen in Solomon / and David. if there
offense be hurfull / and slanderous to the word of god / and pernicious to the
commune wealth / the preacher of Gods word / must not dissemble to correct it
/ by the word of God / plainly without color / or circumloquncion as Nathan
did David / Elias Achab. John Herod. Ffor that / that is spoke to all men / is
as thowghe it work spoken / to noman. so doothe paul teach. The princes ar
called reges / a rege^ do / that is to say. They are called kings which name
commythe of a verb that signifiethe to govern / they must led the people / and
them selfs by the law / and not against the law. to be mynisters of the law /
and not masters of over the law. Cato says well therein. obey the law / that
thou madist thy self. it should not offend the Magistrates to be reprehindyd by
the preacher of the law of God / but rather take it in good part / and thank
God that he has one / to admonyshe him of i will in time. Remembryng the words
Eccl. 10. cap. Rex hodie, and cras morietur. that is to say. to day a king /
and to morrow shall dye. All the estates of the worold in there honor / should
remember the words wroten / Gene. 2. Formauit Dominus deus hominem, lutu^ de
terra. that is to say. the lord God made man / clay of the earth. Which words
should admonish all me^ of there condition and original. Quid igitur superbis
cinis and lutum, Eccl. 10. that is to say / why art thou prode / aisshis / and
clay. thus should all other remember that boste so there nobilite / and thyncke
there be no men but they. In time past / men were accomptyd noble for vertew /
and justice. souche as had done sum noble act / either in peace / ingouernyng
the commune wealth / or in war / for the defense of the his country / and
the heddes thereof. They were born no gentile men / but made gentle men / for
there noble / and vertews acts. The nobilite now adays is degenerat. it
applyythe no study to follow the wisdom / lernyng / and vertews of there
predecessors / but thynkythe it Inawghe to have the name / without effect.
There wisdom / and lernyng ons ruled other: now they contemn lernyng / and
scarce can under stand alernyd man / when ye talkyth of wysdomme / and lernyng.
Traianus the Emperor said unto the captain of his Horse men / when he gave
him a swerd / use this swerd for me / if I command the things: that be right
if not / use it against me. There should no uyce be excusyd / nether defendyd
under the pretense / and cloak of Gods works / nether for the dignite of any
place / manifest injuries / and wykednys permittyd to reign: but the word of
God / should always without respect of persons / stand in his full strengh /
and pour. whose (...) office is / to teach the ignorant / rebuke the
transgressors / chastine the intractable / and to institute man in all kind of
vertew 2. Tim. 3. They should remember / that kingdoms be alteryd / and changyd
by cause of sin Job. and that God removed likewyce princes from there
dignites / by reason of sin / as it is to be seen by Saul the first king
among chrystiane people / 1. Reg. cap. 16. all kings and commune weal this of
chrystiante / were institutyd spetially / to preserve the ministry of the
church / and the estimation of gods word / that people might know / and live
according to it / and as it teachithe to declyne all iniust wartes / and
battelles / to defend them selfs / there realms / and all other / that be
persequutyd for justice / as Abraham did his Neghbours / and Loath / is neuew /
Ge^. 14. to promote peace / and make concord / that they may be / the chylder
of God Mat. 5. No christian man will take me hyre as thowghe I extenuatyd the
Pryncely honor of kings / and other Magistrates / comme^dyd unto us by god:
Whom I honor / reverence / love / and know by the scripture what I awe unto
them. to say / boothe gods / and liefe Romans 13. Ephesians. 6. farther what man's
laws gyuythe Cod. lib. 11. Tit. 74.75. I would all men should observe. The
subjects of every Civil wealth / must bare the charges / and burdon that is
necessary for the preservation thereof. and must not refuse to pay tribute /
unto the superior powers / under the pretense of a chrystiane liberty / but
pay it with out grugge what so ever lawfully / and of dewtie / is demaundyd.
Remembering / the liberty that Christ has yeuen us / is deliverance from sin
/ from death eternal / the Horror of hell / and to restore us to everlasting
liffe / and not to deliver us from the obedience of princes / in souche civil
cases / Mat. 22. Lu. 20. To. 13. give the^ thing to Caesar / that is dew to
Caesar. and to god the thing dew to God. Christ puttithe difference between
those to great lords God / and the civil Magistrate / that people should beware
/ the give not the thing that is dew to on / unto the other. But this order is
changyd for where God commaundithe to give tribute / and other exactions /
helps / or subsides unto Caesar: the people ar made so blind by the falshed of
Antechristes ministres / that they will rather give a gold crown / to the
byldi^g of an Abbay / fundation / of a chantre / or for a Mass of Requiem /
then one silver penny for the defense of there commune wealth. and the thing
that is dew to God / they give unto Caesar / or the Civil Magistrate / to say /
there beliue / and knolege of god. this is only dew unto God / and his word /
and not to King / nor Rayser / or any other Magistrate. Thus is to change Gods
institution. we se daily / how the Princes of the worold persecute the gospelle
and the gospellike use of the sacraments. we pervert therefore Gods law:
which commandithe to give tribute to Princes of the commune wealth for the
preservation thereof / and in matres of religion / to give our selfs booth body
/ and solle / unto God and lern not only by the scripture to love the superior
poures / Gods ordinance / but also consider other examples / where as he
shall se obedience / and love of the subjects to there prince: to be the
strenghe of there realm.

Scipio was demaundyd when he came in warfare / into Africa / how he durst to
enter so strong / and mighti a realm. He said / the obedience of his soulders.
for they were so obedient / that if he bade any of them / fall from the top
of a stiple into the water / they would not have disobeyd him. Se the order /
and concord among the bestes in the Air / as long as there King liuythe
Among the cranes / Plinius libro 10. capit. 23. Nature. Hist. and the little Beee
/ Virgilius Georgicorum 4. lib. Now if they govern not the people well /
which be there brothers / they may read there own damnation Ecclesiastes
9.10. Ezechiel. 19. Hierem. 39.42. and likewyce the ire of God / that they
hark nyd not / to the voice of the preacher / Deuteronomy. 17. It is therefore the
office of every Magistrate / to lern how to rainge over the people by the law
of God. and to desire wisdom of him / to know and follow the things / that
appertain to the ministration of the common wealth. for of him alone
commithe all wysdom / lac. 1. Psalm. 127. Thus knew the godly rules / and were
fortunate in there governance / 2. Re. 6.7.3. Re. 3. if the Magistrate would
read every morning / before he entreat any matter for the commune wealth / the
101. Psalm it should led him to a singular wysdo^ / and marvelous dexterite in
judgment. The people should dalie pray for there Magistrates. for of the^
dependithe the peace and tranquillite of the common wealth / 1. Tim. 2..
Psalm. 20.21. it is a great iniquite for people to neglect there office herin.
There be propre Psalms wrote by the Prophet David / that appartayne unto this
purpose. At the creation / coronatio^ / or inauguratio^ of the magistrate: Psa.
10^. where the people made supplica^tion / at the coronation of King Salo. 1.
Par. 28.29. for a prosperous governance of the common wealth. when te
Magistrate shall take any batell / or war in hand / Psalm. 20. when god yeuithe
victory ^^. and so for all other necessaries tha they may defend the
orphalinges / and pour wydous with all other oppressid wru^gfully. for the
palace of a prince / or Magistrate / should be the refuge / and Sa^ctuarie of the
pour / where as they might offer boldly / as before God / there greues / and
oppressio^s so it aperithe in the prayer of the people / for king Solomon /
Psalm. 101. Saing: Da Deus Regi iudicia tua. that is to say: Give o God / thy
judgments; unto the King. For no Magistrate can govern / with out some form
of judgment / and certain laws. But because all in / dicialles / and decres /
statutes / and laws / made be man / do the many times fail / either for there
own propre imperfection / either by the persiall / and corrupt ministration of
the judge: the people deserid God / to give there King / his judgments. which
ar wroten in his laws / and those the magistrate must observe / Deu. 1.10. and
16 / as Moses did Exo. 18. Leuit. 24. Nu. 15. Joshua Ios. 1. by the which
words we know that all godly laws / should be asked / and sowght out of the
scripture.

The some and conclusion of this 5. precept / and of all that I have spoken in
it / is: that souche as the lord has appointyd in the Earth over us to rule:
those we must reverence / honor / and obey / with all fere / and love. and
that we derogat nothing of there dignite / with contempt co^tumacie / or
vnkyndnys. for seeing god would his ordinance that he has instirutid / to be
inuiolatyd: it is our office to observe the degres / and order of preeminence
/ as he has institutyd.

Caput IX. The syxte Commandment.
Thou shall not kill.
I Said before / that concord / and peace / best preseruid allwaies the commune
wealth. which dependithe of the love of God and our neighburs. Therefore
doothe good immediately after the institution of the common wealth and civil
assemblance of his people / before set in order / and every man apointyd to a
certain place / and vocation / the one to be father / the other the Son /
the on to be Master the other servant / the one to be a disciple / the other an
instructor / the one to be the younger and the other the elder: and each of
these knowithe by the precept and commandment before / what his office is /
and how he should live in his vocation: in this precept he remouythe thoccation
of discord / and debat / that might happen between the members of this commune
wealth / by reason of murder / and man's slawghter. Therefore for byddythe he
all injuries / violence / forse / and othere vncheritable means where with
all we might hurt our neighbors body. And likewyce requirythe that in case we
can do any thing for the healpe of our Neighbor / we diligently apply our
service in his vsee and to procure the things that appertain unto his
tranquilite / to save him from aduersites / and to give him our helpyng hand
when his trobles shall require Seeing there his nothing more dear to man / then
his body / and liefe / as the law of nature teachithe / God by this law
defendythe it against the devil and deuilishe wilful hatred of man. that
sum time is so caryd away with affectiones of the flesh / that he
honorithe not this precept / but contemnythe the ymayge of God in his
neighbowre / hatithe his own flesh and executythe abestly raige / and tyranny
in his brothers body: more like a furious lion / and mad dog then a reasonable
creature. not only to the destruction of him that is kyllyd but to the loost /
and perdicion of his own body and solle for ever: if he repent not. God in
this commandment for biddithe not only the murder done with the hand but
also the murder of the heart / and of the tongue: Matthew. 5.1. Joan. 1. in the
murder of the hand is for byddyn all pryuat reuenchyng between pryuate persons
that will be judges in there own causes. Which begin with blows / then
folowythe or hurtyng of some membre of the body / or clean destruction of it /
at the last murder of the hole body. Sum kill with the swerd / sum with
poison / sum with inchauntementes / sum Dessemble as thowghe they playde /
and so in burdyng puttythe him out of the way that he hatythe. Sum kill not
them self nor will not besene to break the peace but shut there boltes by
other men and wound and kill him that is an hundrythe mile from him. These the
laws punish with death / Genesis 9. Mat. 26. like wice the laws of men / Just.
lib. 4. tit. 18.

Souche as procure and sarche the death of man priuelie the law punishithe
more cruelli. Not with the swerd / nether fire / or any other so lemne manner of
death / but he should be inclosyd in a tronke with a dog / a cock / a snake
/ and a nape and so be cast into water / and dye among these rigures bestes.

Those yet less offend / then souche as conspyre the death of any prince / or
gouerner of the commune wealth. Or by treason intend the destruction of the
commune wealth or any man that gouernythe therein. Those have there pain of
death apointyd / lege Iulia. Inst. lib. 4. ti. 18. Depublicis iudicijs. So
has the law respect of the persons and will know who is kyllyd / a private
person / or gouerner / a man / or a woman: one of his own blud / or a stranger
/ that the pai^e may be according. In the ministration / whereof the Magistrate
/ or Prince should always observe justice / as well against one man / as the
other with out respect of persons. Remembryng that it appertaynythe nothing
unto there office / to save / or damn / to give one a charter of liefe / and
put an other that has don^e the like offense to death.

The Magistrate is but a minister of the law / and is bound for the laws sake
to sus^fre him to live / that transgressithe not the law / so is he bound / to
put him to death / that has offendid the law. So God commaundithe / Deuteronomy.
19. that the judge shall have no mercy upon the offender / and shewithe three
causes why. The one that he should take the i will out of the commune wealth. The
other is a promiss of Gods grace for his so dyng.

The third is / that other might fere to do the same we have examples thereof in
the Capitan^ that were ha^gyd against the son / Nu. 25. and of Marie the
Emperor Moses Sister that when she was a lepre was compellyd to obey the law
as well as the pouryst of the congregation / Number. 21.

It is i will done therefore of princes / and Magistrates to give charters / and
priuelegys to saw souche / as by the law should die. And asbrode example for
other / that thinck when need is / I shall have friends like wyce to beg my
perdon. In case it cannot be optaynyd / he that laborythe in the cause / will
scarce be conte^dyd / that his request can take none effect / the matter being
of no greater weight / then before by other optaynyd grace. Thus in dispensing
of an i will fact: is boothe God and man offendyd. And the Prince / or Magistrate
that dispe^sithe with the fault of an other / makithe him self culpable of
the same crime as it is wroten. Proverb. 17. cap. S^pien. 6. Of the other part
/ the judges that condemn the right / and deliver the wrong / committ the same
horrible offense. and worthy by the law to suffer the pain / that is dew unto
him that should for his offenses dye. like wyce should souche as be letters / or
other wyce defice / or procure the let / or delay of justice in saving or
repryyng the offender / which is an horrible offense / and daily vsyd the more
petye in every assyce and sessions. The pretend a work of cherite and good deed
to saw a man that is worthy of death. but the judge of all equite / mercy /
and justice / says they should not extend there mercy to souche a person /
nor in souche a case / but commaundythe without mercy to put them to death
that justice condemnythe. Men will be in an i will cause more merciful then the
fountain self of mercy. but where as they should be merciful in remitting a
pryuate displeasure / done unto the^ by a poor man / then will they exequte
not only justice / but also tyranni. So peruerte they / the law of God / and
judge i will good. and godd i will / and like wice reprehend the ordinance of god.
God gave certain preuilegis that who so ever kyllid against his will might fle
to a saynctuary to saw his liefe. but he that kyllyd of malice or of a
pretencyd purpose / might be browght to the Galaus not only out of the
sanctuary / bu^ from the altar Deuteronomy. 19. and this is not only the law of Moses
but also the law of christ that says Math. 26. cap. he that strykythe with
the swerd / with the swerd shale peryshe. when it pleasythe God souche a
transgressour to be taken / the judge that iudgithe and the person that is
iudgid should think / this is the time that the commune wealth / should be
delivered from an i will person. and he tha^ must suffer / should thynk this is the
time that God will punyshe me for my sin / and call me to his mercy.

The prince huld suffer the ordinance of god to take place. for as Teren.
says male docet facilitas multa. Heautonei. that is to say over mouche pity
teachythe many things i will. the which vice he teachithe men beware / of in
Hecy. Etsi ego meis me omnibus scio etiam ad prime obseruantem, sed non adeo ut
facilitas mea illoru^ corrumpat animos. Therefore he that would purchese a
charter / should rather com to the prison to confort the afflictyd man and say.
this troble is the preacher sent from God to bring the to acknolege of thy
sin / and to call the to penance. Thou seyst how the devil has preuaylyd
against the. Ffolowyng the blyndenis of thine affection thou gauyst place to
the devil that delytithe in the i will doings of men therefore thou must suffer
the pain of the law. and from hensforthe thou shall give no place more unto
him. know Christ / and belyue that in him thou shall suffer no pain for thy
transgression but only the death of the body. he shall now carye the / from
the Galowes into eternal loy as he did the thyffe in the cross. Obey
therefore the commandment of God in this public ministracion of justice for
now is thy time to die / not that God hatythe the / but of a singular love that
thou should hurt no more thy self and other. beg with me in christ thy
charter of God / and his mercy shall give the eterna^l lief which thou may
boldly by the law a^cleme. And not to put him in a false hope of man's
remission that can give no pardon at all if they dowell. in case a private
person / a man that louythe peace happen to be op^ressyd at any time of those
breakers of peace / (...) robbers by the high way side or other wa^es / cannot
defend his lief / and body / wit^e out using resistaynce / and the oppressoure
will not be content / nether with reason / nether with fere words / nether
the man oppressyd may in nowyce find place / to a void the fury of this
appressour indefendyng his own liefe / if he kill his adversaries he no more
offendythe gods laws / nether man's laws then thowhe he kyllid awoulfe /
or mad dog as Moses killyd the Aegyption or as the godly magistrate kyllyth
pryu^atlye the thyffe / or openly / defendithe him self by war when he cannot
maintain / or recoure the right of his commune wealth other wyce. Then to use
the extreme remedy of batell / he offendithe not. So is it to be iudgyd of
those that will oppress by vyole^ce other: that either offend not / either be
redye to offer there causes to the vycars of God / the judges off the earth if
they find there own death / it is to be iudgyd that it is none other thing /
then the just judgment of god that the one should defend his liefe / and the
other perish. A great i will is it / that those i will men that dar not bring there
cause to be iudgyd before the lawful Magistrate ar permittyd so licensiouslie /
to troble the peaceable people / of a realm with out punyshement. Which is
against Gods laws / and man's laws / and thoccation of great murder /
which prouokythe the jre of God against the Magistrates for the sufferaunce of
so great / and i will. I know / how men that govern after Aristotelles politikes /
will excuse this i will. They will say that laws must be made according to the
nature of the people / to whom they are prescribid. But Gods laws says / man
must obey the law / and not the law man. if they be christians it shall not be
a servitude / to live after the laws of Christ / who should govern cheffelie
boothe the superior and the inferior. And so says also Aristot. libr. 5.
Polit. cap. 9. Non est seruitus uiuere ad formam reipub. sed salus. I Englyshid
this the second verse before: it should not be difficile to remove this i will: if
every man that shall se the peace broken in a cite / had auctorite to sondre
the persons / and bynd the peace breakers to apeace / by there words / and
he that brake his faith / and promise to him that requiryd it / to lose his head
in the name of apayne. as it is vsyd in some commune wealths. Murder is
commyttid like wyce by hand / by souche as ar every man's men for money. As
these run agates / and lance knights ar / that sell boothe body and soul
to souche as will hyre the^. They care not whether the cause be wrong or right.
They should nether receive / by the law of God nether any christianeman give
them any thing except the cause be godd. if it be: every man is bund to defend
it. If not: noman. This cannot be known of all men: but if the cause be nowght
/ God excusythe noman / but estimithe him a murderer of his own liefe / and
the Magistrate that hyrithe him thoccation thereof.

This precept is not under stond only of external murder / but forbiddythe
also the murder of the heart. which thowghe it deserve no punishment in the
worold / yet God accomptythe is worthy of death / as it is to be seen / Genesis
4. where as God accusyd Cain for the murder of his heart / before he laid
hands on Abell / to kill him. so doothe saynct. Io. 1. Epist. 3. say. he that
hatythe his brother / is a murderer. Then is there the Murder of the tongue /
worthy death before God / not only of the body / but also of the soul. The
wiche is commyttid by a cursyng slandering and a conuicious tongue. of a cursyng
tongue / Christ speakyth Math. 5. he that says to his brother Raah is gilty of
council. the which word Raah in English signifyythe i will / or affliction.
Christ meanythe there / that he only is not a murderer that by hand killyd his
brother / but also he that cursythe / or desyrithe i will to his neygbour. as
those do that bid the pestilence / the fever quaterne / saynct Antones i will / or
souche other execrations. And should be punishyd as heretics / and blasphemers
of God / as ye may read Leuit. 20. Genesis 27. Leuit. 19. 1. Cor. 5. 1. Pet. 4.
souche i will sayers has no part in the kingdom of God. He that callythe his
brother folle. that is to say contemn him / moke him / or as men call it now a
day lowtyng of a man / commyttithe souche murder / as is worthy hell fire / and
eternal damnation. The which vice is reprehendyd / Psalm. 56. and was so
abhorryd of the gentilles / that many would rather suffer death / then
sustain the slanders of a pestilence tongue.

The derision of the simple how great a sin it is / and equivalent with
murder / we se by the punishment of Cham / who was so cursyd of his father Noah
/ that his posterite suffryd for his offense. Maledictus Cham, seruui seruorum
erit fratribus suis. that is to say. Cursyd be Cham who shall be unto his
brothers the servant of servants. Gene. 9.

Samson was accomptyd of the Philistians for a folle but he would rather dye
then suffer that opprybrye vnreuenchyd Iudic. 16. David was lowtyd of Michol

David reuengyd the contumely of his Ambassadors contemnyd of the Ammonites
read 1. Reg. cap. 10. and the^ thou shall perceive that mocking is none other
but murder, In the 4. book of the kings cap. 2. see how the boys mockyd the
preacher of Gods word / Elizeus the prophet / and how God punyshid the same
with death more cruel / then the Magistrate punyshyte the murderer. Of these
places / we se what murder is / and how many ways it is committyd. The occasion
thereof / is ire / envy / hatred / disdain / indignation and souche like. we
see also the pain appoyntid by Gods laws / and man's laws / lib. 4. inst.
Cod. lib. 9. But of these places infer not / that it is not lawful for the
Magistrate to punyshe the i will doer by death / the father to correct his child /
the master hi^ servant / or the preachers the vice of the people these laws
appertain unto all private persons / and not unto souche as God has yeuen
jurisdiction ones other. of the Magistrates we have Roman. 13. which offend not

Jews traitors and murderes Act. 7 and Paul the Gallathyens folles Gal ^. yet
offendyd nothing at all against this law / thou shall not kill. but served the
place of there vocations as it was commaundyd them by God. Anger is no syn^e /
so that the origynall thereof / and the end whether it extendithe / be vertews
and proceed with cherite. Moses was anger and brake the tables of God in his
zealous / and godly passion. He put the idolatres to death. but the end was to
destroy vice / and to maintain vertewe. So was David / so was Paul / so was
Christ but it sprange of a love to wards God / and extendyd to a vertewes end
the punishment of vice / and commendation of vertew.

Caput X. The seuenthe commandment.
Thou shall commet none adultery.
THat there should never fail succession / and posterite to preserve the
commune wealth that God had ordainyd for man / as well before his fall in
Paradise / as after in this vale of misery: he ordainid matrimony between man
and woman. Which is the institucio^ and ordinance of God / aprouid by the law
of nature / the law of Moses / and the law of Man / and the law of the Gospel.
Meaning / and wyllyng this ordinance to be reuerentlye obseruyd of all men
has yeuen this precept: that noman should dishonor / defile / or contaminat
himself with any indecent / or intemperat kind of liffe. This is the end /
and purpose Why this law was yeuen. to avoid a dissolute / commune / and
libidinous liefe with other vnclenlinis. To love / and keep chastity / and
purite of life: which consistithe / either in sincere virginite / or faithful
matrimony / as Chrysostom. writite Homil. de invent. cruc. Primus gradus casti
tatis est, syncera uirginitas. Secundus, fidele matrimonium. That is to say:
The first degree of chastity is / pure virginite. The second / faithful
matrimony the same division of chastity / aprouithe the scripture / 1. Corin.
7. where as Paul definithe / and shewithe / that virginite is a chastity of
the body / coniunyd with the purite of the mind. By these words: Caelebs
cogitat, quae domini sunt, quomodo sancta sit corpore and spiritu. That is to
say: she that is vnmaryd think^the the things that be of God / how she may be
holy / boothe in body / and in sprite. Of matrim^nie / and the purite thereof:
it is wrote^ / Ebr. 13 Honorabile est inter oe^s matrimonium, and cubile
impollutum. That is to say: Matrimony is honorable / among all (nations) and
the bed impollutid. no man should continue in a sole liefe / but souche as has
no need of matrimony / following the word of God / and ordinaunc in man's
nature / according to the examples of the Patriarchs / Prophetis / and the
Apostelles: which were not excludid from matrimony / althowghe they were
ministers of the church. nor never made / law to exclude there successors.
but recitithe the matrimony of the ministers / among the vertews and
necessary gifts that is requirid in the minister. 2. Timo. 3. Tit. 1. and
callithe the prohibition of matrimony the doctrine of the devil. The which
the iniquite of our Doctors. that defend with swerd / and fire / the sole
liefe of the ministres / would put from them / unto the old Heretics / the
Tatians. who for bid matrimony to all men. And they damn not it / but only
for bid it / to the order of Ecclesiastical ministers. As thowght they damnid
not matrimony because they for bid it not to all / but to sommen. It is like /
as if the physician should say to too men of one ayge / one disposion / and
sick in one diseace / that the medicine / that helythe the one / will kill the
other. But the scripture is against the^ / and also the fathers for the most
part. the council of Nice condescendid to the mind and sentence of Paphnutius
that said / faithful marriage was chastity: and not unto supersticious persons
that always dream sum novelties to be accomptid glorious. The temerite of
these laws and law makers / has been godly / and lernydlye all times
confoundyd. It sufficithe us / loyallement / and with good faith / to hyre
this commandment / commit no adultery. which for biddithe not only to
abstain from an other man's wieffe / the which boothe Gods laws and man's
laws / Christians / and Gentiles punishithe with death / Deuteronomy. 22. Leuit.
20. libr. Inst. 4. Tit. De publ^ iudicijs. Also the desire / and lust of the
heart is forbyddyn / Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. 5. Matthew. 5.

Farther all orther women ar for byddin / whether it be virgin / widow / or
other common woman. The policy of Moses putt to death / only the man and
woman that committid adultery How be it all kinds of vlterie in this precept
ar for bydden as Paul wrytythe / 1. Corinthians. 5. Where he equalithe and makythe
like / fornication / and rape / with adultery / ^ede the place. And byddythe
to fle fornication. So doothe he / Ephesians. 5. and says that the Ir^ of God
accustomithe to cum for souche sins. Like wice we se by the punishment of
fornication / and oppression of virgins which is not inferior to adultery.
The city of Sichem / and the inhabitants thereof were destroyed / for the
oppressing of Dina Jacobs dawghter Genes. 34. Judas commaundid Thamar the
wydowe to be put to death / for dishonoring of widowed Gene. 38. Pinehas
kyllyd Simri the Isrealite / with his hoar Casbi the Midianite / Nume. 25. so
that all kind of adultery is for bidden / and nothing in this case to be
admittid / but the lawful conjunction between man and woman. But this is not
all that this precept for biddithe. for as it for biddithe the act it self so
doothe it adultery of the heart / and of the Iye like wice the adultery of the
mouth / as unchaste and filthi communication. The adultery of the hands that
prouokythe or mouythe the person that is not his. Solomon says he shall borne
his cote / that barythe fire in his besomme: and burn his fette that walkythe
upon the coals. Here is for bydden likewice the adultery of apparel / and so
consequently all excess of mete and drink / and other occasions / that are
inductions to this i will / and commith of the concupiscens of the heart / for
bydden in the scripture. Peter says / 1. Pet. 3. The habit / and apparel of
a woman shall not be in brodyd and splayde here nether in laing on of god / or
costley array. ye se in our time / that many bare more upon there backs then
they be worth. A woman pamperid up with precious stones and gold: knottyd be
hind and before with more periles / then here housbond and she bestowithe in
alms all days of there lieffe. An other sort / that lackythe where with all
to bestow these charges: ar a dilling / and burling of there here a longer
time / then a godly woman that redithe the scripture to follow it: is in
appareling of three or four young infantes. If this were only in the women / it
were the less harm: but it is also in men for there is not asmouche as he
that has but 40. Schillinges by the year but is as long in the morni^g / to
set his berd in an order / as a godly crawstis man would be / in loming of a
peace of karsey.

And not only they / but also souche as should give there servants an example
of sobriety: as well in the Clerge / as among the Civil gouerners of the
earth. I speak not against a decent and semely apparel of man nor / woman:
every person in his degree. But that each of them should avoid the excess and
i will thereof that is for bidden in Gods laws: and rather study to commend him
self by vertews / then to be estimyd by his apparel. thus doothe not God /
but but also Ethnykes teach / as Cicero. 1. offic. Adhibenda est mundicia: non
odiosa, nec exquisita nimis, tantum quae fugiat agrestem. and inhumanam
negligentia^. That is to say / souche amens should be kept in apparel / that
should be nor to net / nor to fylthy / but souche as might avoid a rude / and
bestlie negligence. In the 5. Matthew. and Luc. 6. we se how Christ interpretithe
this precept: not only to a void the i will it self / but also thoccasions of
it / sayng if thynne Iye / or yight hand offend the / cast them of. Where as
Christ shewythe there is no occasion that can excuse adultery or fornication.
As this sin has degreis in it self as ye se / and may perceive by the
pains rehersid: so is it more offense in one person then in the other. more in
ayge then in uthe: more in the Magistrate / or Prince / then in a private person
/ more in the teacher of Gods word / then in the herer.

And as the condition of the persons agrauat the offense / so should justice
agrauat the punishment thereof. and not to punyshe the one / and let the other
go. There is noman more preuilegyd then the other. As justice is executyd
against the inferior / so should it be against the superior. For as the one is
subject unto the law / of God so is the other. There is an other kind of
adultery for bydden in this precept which Christ speakythe of Matthei. 5. and
19. capit. which is unlawful diuorsemement of matrimony where as the man
puttythe away the woman or the woman / the man for unlawful causes.

The same auctorite has the woman to put away the man / that the man has to
put away the woman / Marc. 10. Christ says there is no lawful cause to
dissolve matrimony / but adultery. For when the woman yeuithe the use of her
body to an other man / she is no more here first housboundes wiefe. Nor the
housbound no no longer the housbound of his wief / then he observe the faith
of matrimony with her: where so ever this fault happen / and can be prouyd
by certain signs / and lawful testimonies: the persons may by the auctorite
of Gods word and ministry of the Magistrates be separatyd so one from the
other / that it shall be Lawful for the man to marie an other wief / and the
wief to marie an other housbound / as Christ says Matt. 5. and 19. so that
the man shall not need to keep at homme wi^he him a woman / that is no more his
then an other man's.

Nether the woman souche a housbound as is no more hers / the^ an other
woma^nes: Mar. 10. S. Pau. ^. Co. 7. shewithe and other cause of deuorsment /
when the one of the persons being marid is an infidele / and of a contrary
faith. If this person will not dwell with the other that is his fellow in
matrimony / and a Christian. it is lawful to break the faith of Matrimony
/ and marie with an other. So says S. Ambros. writing in the same place / of
S. Paul: Non debetur reuerentia coniugij ei, qui horret autorem coniugij. That
is to say / the reuerencie of matrimony is not dew unto him / that contemnithe
the autour of matrimony. And in the same place / Contumelia enim creatoris
soluit ius matrimonij, circa eum qui relinquitur, ne accusetur alij copulatus.
That is to say / the contempt of God breakithe the right of matrimony
co^serning him that is for saken / lest he should be accusyd being marid to an
other.

Thou seist that the lord Matt. 5.19. yeuithe license for adultery / to
deuorse / and marie again And Paul for infidelite. The divorce that the
Bishopes permit in there lawis / is no divorce but only the name of it. For
they will not permit those persons / thus deuorsid to marie again. They say
/ what God has coniugnid / man should not separate. Who denyythe that? God
speakythe of the woman that standithe by the law / and ordinance of God /
being lawfully maryd / an does office of awyffe. If adultery / or the case of
infidelite chance / man dissolnythe not the Matrimony / but the person self
that offendithe. and the Magistrate is but a testimony of his / or her i will fact
/ that has broken / and dissoluyd that / that God coplyd. And protestythe to
the worold / that they thus dissoluyd / may marye again / not withstondyng the
former mariayge. Thowgh mannis laws admit it not / Gods laws doothe. whois
words / may not be wrestyd out of tune / but all ways applied to the end /
they were spoken. The pharisees Mat. 19. cap. demaundyd of Christ / whether it
were lawful for a man / to deuorse his wiefe / for every cause / and to marie
a another: as all those did in the time of Mosen Deuteronomy. 24. Christ answered
directlye to the question / and said / it was not lawful for aman to put away
his wiefe / and marie and other / Except she committyd adultery. Then / and
for that cause / it is Lawful now in the time of the gospel / as it was in
the time of Moses law. But for the frawardnys of conditions / or tediousnis of
manners / men should not separat there wiefes / nether from bed nether from board.
Mouche less marie an other. He or she / that cannot with wysdomme amend the
displeasaunt / and cro^yd manners of his / or her mate: must patiently bare
them. Remembering / if Christ command us to be of souche a tollerancye / and
patience to endure the obloquie / and injuries of all men thowghe they be our
ennymies: how mouche more the morosite / and iniures of a domestical
companion? A hard cross / but patience must ligthen it / till God send a
redress. Christ yet speakythe of an other adultery Mat. 19. which those
commit / that marie at one time / too wiefes / and say / if a man have an
hundrythe (as he may have / as well as too) yet all be but too / and one flesh
in the lord. Christ doothe not so interpretat too / Matthew. 19. cap. but
referrythe too / to one man / and one woman / as the text that he alegythe out
of Gene. cap. 1.2. declarithe / sayng. have ye not reden that he / that made
from the beginning: made them male / and female. Therefore shall man leave father
and mother / and officiat his wieffe / and shall be too / in one flesh. this
text admittythe no pluralites of wiefes / but destroythe plain the sentence of
those that defend the conjunction of many wiefes with one man. for as at the
begyming of Matrimony was but one man and one woman / created / and married to
gather: no more should there be now in one matrimony as Christ there teachite /
and expoundith too in one fleche / and not three or fore in one flesh. the word
of god must be folowid / and not thexamples of the fathers in this case. It is
also for hydden by man's laws / Codic. lib. 5. Tit. 5. de incestis and
inutilibus nuptijs. Neminem, qui sub ditione sit Romani nominis, by nas uxores
habere posse uulgo patet, etc. it is co^munely known that no man being under
the jurisdiction of Rome can have too wiefes / says the emperors Dioclet.
and Maximia^. S. Paul 1. Cor. 7. giuithe a godly precept if it were godly
vsyd. read the chapter at the begiming. the conclusion of the sentence is thus
/ speaking to the persons marid. depart not the one from the other except it be
by co^^ent for a time / to apply fasti^g / and praing / and then com to gather
again / lest the devil tempt you for your intemperancie. If Paul could do
any thing with men that be maryd / they would not for there pleasures / or
private lucre make so many vyages out of there countries / or within there
countries leaving there wiefes / children / and housholdes as for saken
orphelynes.

How light so ever this ungodly people make there gaddynges / or
peregrinations: they shall be culpable / and actomptable / for as many faults /
as is done by his family / trowghe his absence / and negligence / before god.
How this sin of adultery is punyshyd. Read Genes. 12.20.39. Job. 31. legem
Iuliam Just. lib. 4. Tit. 18. de pub. iudicijs. and look not how man vsythe now
to punyshe it / that rather accomptithe it a vertew then a vice / but see what
punishment god appayntythe fore it in the scripture.

Caput XI. The eyghthe commandment.
Thou shall not stele.
THis eyghthe law / extendithe to this end / that we give unto every man that
/ that is his. And in so doing we resemble the master of this law God allmighti
/ that aborrythe all in iustes / and louythe equite and right. As here is for
byddin to stele the gods of other: so is there commaundid / and requirid to
employ diligence in keeping the gods / that be our own. Remembryng that
every man receauythe at Gods hand his gods and parselles thereof / and not by
fortune or his own travel. Therefore to abuse them is not only a lost of the
gods / but also Injuries / unto the dispensation of God / who willythe the
rich to give gladly and with thanks unto the pour / the pour to receive
religiously as out of the spence / or seller of the lord with thanks yeuing.

The rich to exercise his faith in yeuyng / and to think that the way to
beryche / is not to mucke up in the chofer / but to be liberal / and to put
out mouche to the pour / for the commandments sake / and thynck the promise
of God will send it in again. The pour to exercise his faith in receiving /
when he has nothing at home / yet God has opened the heart of one or other
to give him his necessaries / and that allwaies God is faithful in his promise
/ and will give bred to the hungre at all times oportune / Psalm. 145.4. Reg. 4.
cap.

This law principallye / for byddythe all injuries that afflict / or
diminishite the riches / facultes / glory / estimation / fame / and all other
things expedient for body and soulle. all actions / and trauese of the law /
that might be endyd cheretable with out breach of love / and all other
vncheritable expenses. all violent / and forsable oppressions be night / or
day / as well of them as rob with the hand by the high way side / as of
them that by counsel / affection / auaryce / hatred / or by request of letters
inuert / and pervert justice. like wyce all fraud / and gile in bying / or
selling / and breeking of promys in all barginnes / and contractes. Or when
there is taken from the law / that which is hers. that his to say / when she
takythe exequution and punishment of one i will doer / and not of an other / not
because there causes differ or be unlike / but that she is robbyd by forse of
here justice / by the iniust persons / and judges / that judge not by the law
/ but against the law. As this robberye of justice is vsyd communely against
gods lawe^ and man's: so has it optainid a commune so the sayng among all
people. Dat uenia^ coruis^ uexat censura columbas. that is to say / he yeui^
the pardon to the ravens / and oppressithe the do^ues with exaction the
sentence meanythe / that the great thyffes and robbers ar at liberty / and
sometime o copy the sete of justice / when the litl^ thyffes ar hankyd. He is
not only a thiffe / tha^ by day robbithe / and breakithe me^nis houses b^
night / but also those that by any means let the thing to be paid / that is
dew / whether it be to the law / or to those that be under the law. Too manner
of ways all injuries / and wro^ges ar done The one in with holdi^g an others
right: and the other in taking a wax an others right.

The things unjustly with holdin / ar the gods of the body or of the mind.
of the body ar th^^se. the housbo^d / the wiefe / the childer / the seruan^tes
/ the patrones / and the pupilles. Money / war^ and all souche other things as
is vsyd in the lie^fe of man necessary for the body. if these things b^
trewlie gote^ / the honor must godly use the^ to his glory and to the profet
of his neighbor. i^ they be gote^ with fraud / g^le / and deseite. kep^
them not / for they be none of thynne / restore the^ to the right honor / or
else it is thifft / and noman can dispense with the for them: thowghe thou
shreue thy self to the pryst and cause al^ ^he massis of the worold to be said
for the. or if ^how be delivered from that supersticion bost of the gospel
never so mouche.

Let the^ that trade the curse of Marchaundes in there vocation / beware of
this danger. souche as has the cure of souls beware they hold not there
stipendes / and deserve the^ not. Souche as be servants that they eat not
there masters bred / and receive there wages for nowght. As for those men that
give there wayges / to souche as live an i will / and vnocopyd lieffe as the most
part of the nobilite doothe now a day: it is against gods laws to keep any
souche in there house / for they mentaine ilenys which is for byde^ 1. These.
4.2. These. 3. and the servant that receauythe it commyttythe thyfft. for he is
co^mau^dyd to labor with his hands / to feed him self / and other. Thowh it
be vsid of princes / potestates / and all men of the worold / yet that
excusythe not the fault before god. for it was never reden in the law of god
nor in the law of any man that had knolege in a commune wealth / that an i will
man was accomptyd as any membre there of. as ye may read in Plato. and Aristot.
what persons be mete to dwell in a commune wealth. How vnrewlie a sort of
people the i will men be thou may se by the wrytynges of Cicer. When the Impire
of Rome fell out with it self by sedition libr. 6. de Republi. and in an
Epistol. ed Varronem. Crudeliter enim otiosis minaba^tur: eratqueijs and tua
inuisa uoluntas, and mea oration. Noman should retain the wages of his servant /
but satisfy all ways his couenauntes. farther they offend against this law
of God that by forse or violence / fraud or any other way unjustly with hold
and keep any man's child / or servants / as those do / that by forse or
fraud marie any man's child against the will of his parents. Souche as has
great foreftes / or parkes of dear / or Conyes / that pasture / and feed upon
there neygbours ground. Or Columbaries where as doves assemble and haunt / and
those feed / of the poures corn: I refer it to the cherite of every man
whether the keeping of souche bestes be not against Gods laws / and man's
laws. and whether it be not suffryd rather for a few men's pleasure / then
for many mennis profet.

If any man should kill any of those bestes / it were felony in many places.
Where as the law Civil callythe those wild bestes the gods of the honor /
no longer then they bide at home / or have a purpose to return home. Which
will never be as long as they find good byte in the pour man's pasture or
corn / except they be chasyd home. whether those bestes be not as well the
pour man's / if he can take them in his pasture / as the honors / read the
law / Inst. lib. 2. ^. De rerum diuisione and acquirendo illarum dominio. I
cannot tell with what good conscience any man can fare well with the detriment
of his neighbor. let every man judge with cheririte whether it be well done
or not. As it is sin to retain unjustly these Gods of the body / whether
they be ours or other men's: so it is to retain the gods of the mine. As good
counsel / lerning / wysdomme or any other thing else / that may aid our
brother in things of religion and vertew. And as every man that seythe his
brother waunt things necessary for the body / in case he help him not has
no cherite in him / as Joan says / 1. Joan. 3. so he that seythe his brother
want the knolege of God / and Good counsel / in case he ayede him not the best
he can / is culpable of his brothers damnation.

The other part that conteinithe the transgression against this law is / in
taking away an other man's right / or gods. which goddis like wyce be of
the body / or of the soul. of the body as I rehersyd before / which ar taken
away beforese / or violence secreatlye / or apertly. As by thefes / pirates
and other / that against Gods laws / and man's laws spoil / and robb.
likewice souche as war in the defense of any common wealth / and under the
pretense of warf^re / thinckyth all spoils / and rapes to be lawful as those
do that under the name of justice co^mit^ vnpunishid all injustice. Souche as
be fraud and crauffte in byyng or selling / making of bargains or other
contractes deceive any man is condemnid by this law of theiffte. As those that
sell wares that be nawght / or corruptid / for things lawful. The things
that be godd / for more then they be worth. which vsithe not there crauffte
to profet many / but for there own private commodite. Of this avarice /
co^mithe usury / fraud / false contractes / breakyng of faith and promises /
contempt of all trewthe and honesty / for stallinges / and ingrossinge of
markettes / co^pactes / and agreme^tes between the rich / that things may not
be sold / as the be worth / but as there avarice has agreid upon. This
makithe scarsite of all things / and robbithe the pour me^bres of every
common wealth / and bring hithe the greater part of souche co^modites as be
in every realm into a few rich me^nes hands. so that they cannot be sold as
common gods of the civil wealth. but as the gods of one private person.
the which Monopoly or selli^ of one man / is for biddin / not only i^the law
of god: but also by the law of man / Cod. li. 4.79. and that under agreat
pain: Bonis proprijs expoliatus, perpetuitate da^net^ exilij. That is to say:
forfeting his own gods and to be da^nid to perpetual exile / or banisme^t.
Justinian. saw well / when one solie bowght / because only he might sell again
/ was not profetable but hurtful for the common wealth. As it is in byyng /
and selling of things mouable for byddin to use fraud: so is it in the gods
of the earth immovable as lands / houses / and possessions / which now in
manner ar only the gods of the rich. And so hau^sid that the pour ca^ not
got as mouche as a cotaige to put himself / his wiefe / and his children in
which cryythe ve^ge^ce i^ the aeres of the god of batell / Esai. 5 read the
chap. and se / the curse of god against those infaciable raue^ers / and eters
of the pour. yet when they have all to gather and suffrithe not the pour to
have nor house nor re^t: they will ocopie yet all craufftes and trade of bijng
/ and selling that the pour man shaall have nor gods not handie crauffte to
help himself with all. How doothe these men hyre / or read the word of god
that biddithe them give there own gods to the pour: which nether yeuithe
there own / nether sufferithe them not / to by at a reasonable price the thing
that is not there is. The Emph. Honor. and Theod. cod. li. 4. tit. 63. de co^mer.
et market. gave other laws for there common wealths / writing in this manner.
Nobiliores natalibus and honoru^ luce co^spicuos, and patrimonio ditiores
perniciosu^ urbibus mercimo niu^ exercere prohibemus, ut inter plebeios and
negotiatores facilius sit emendi, uendendique commertium. That is to say /
souche as he of noble parentayge / and baryng rule ^n the common wealth and
rich by patrimony we forbid to exercise byyng and selling which is hurtful
to cites / that among the common sort of people / and ocopiers in the trade of
byyng and selling might be the more facile or common. This faculty and trade
of merchau^dis / that now is vsyd for avarice / was inue^tid for a good purpose
to co^municat souche things as was necessary for the liefe of man and not to
the use that now it is applied / Plin. in pan. Diuersasque gentes ita co^mertio
co^miscuit, ut quoth ge^tiu^ esset usqua^, id apud omnes gentes natu^ esse
uideretur* souche as god has yeuen gods unto or possessions of the worold /
should live apo^ the same. and he that has one craffte to live by / should not
ocopij too / for fere of doing wrong to his neighbor.

As for usury and applyyng of monij or any thing else to an unreasonable gain:
it is none o^ then thiefft. I would men should rather refrain from giving of
money to again all to gother: the^ break the law of cherite / that helpithe
without lokyng for gain / Lu. 6. Leui. 19. and also / Exo. 22. Deu. 23.
because usury is plain for bidden. The laws and co^stitutio^s of the
magistrates civil admittithe certain gain / and usury / as yered cod. li.
4. ti. 32. thowghe they be in many thin^^ scarce to be born with all / yet I
would they were well obseruid. but souche is our tymme that every man is in
this case / alaw to him self and takythe what he can. Here is for boden also
all games for money as disse / cards / cloysshe / and other. which is very
theffte / and against cherite that would rather augment his neighbors Gods
then make them less. so the diminution of any mannis fame as when for vain
glory any man attribute unto him self the wit / or lerni^g that an other
brain has browght forth: where of many has co^plainid as this of Virg.
Hos ego uersiculos feci, tulit alter honores. They make a fere shewwith an
other birds feathers as Aesopes croe did. This offense Mart. 3. callithe
plagiu^. Impone^s plagiario pudorem. speking of him that stale his books.
Souche as ar apointid to be common / and public receauers that twysse ask
the thing dew of the people / ons for them selfs and ons for the lord. Or
souche as bare office to se the treasure of a commune wealth preseruid / and
augme^tid as it is need / with the revenues that belong to the same as
receauers / auditors / tresurours / pay masters with other / co^mitt more then
th^ffte / if they use any part of the gods belonging to a common wealth to
a private use / pandect. libro. 48. lex Iul. and causithe the superior
magistrates to charge there subjects with new exactio^ / which should not need
to be done if all things paid by the people / were trewlie browght home /
and faithfully leyde up to the use it was gathered for. Agreater thefft yet is
it to constrayne any person that is fre / to do any thing against his liberty /
as many times the fader doothe his son / selle him as abound man / and marie
him where he list / and to whom he list. thus offend like wise those that
persuade any man's child to for sake his parents / or any servants there
master / and is punishid in the law with death. or exile.

It is also th^fft / to oppress any just cause that is in contrauersie / by
forse / affection or authorite of any superior pour / or request by letters /
not only against Gods laws / Deute. 25. But also against man ^is law /
Codic. libro. 2. tit. 13. where as by these words.

Divine admodum constituit D. Claudius consultissimus parens noster, ut iactura
causae afficerenturij, qui sibi patrocinium potencioru^ aduocassent: ut hoc
proposito metu iudiciariae lites, potius suo mart discurrerent, quam
potenciorum domorum opibus niterentur. That is to say: the Godly and most
prudent prince / our father Claudius vere godly decreid / that those should
lost there suit / that optaynyd the healpe of noble men: that by this fere /
all causes of contrauersis might be vsyd indifferentlye / rather then to depend
of theestimation of any superior pour. If this th^fft where auoydyd pour
mennis causis should find more grace / and rich mennis conscience more vertew.
Espetially the judges that for got what place they be in / and serve the
wor^ld more then God. How deuillishe and great offensse it is before God / thus
to corrupt justice they may learn of David Psalm. 82. that begynnythe in Latin:
Deus constitit in coetu Dei. That is to say / God sett^the / or is present in
the Senate / or place of judgment. This Psalm all judges should lern behart /
and practice it, likewise mark the second verse of the Psalm / that says
thus. How long will ye judge peruerslie / and corrupt justice at the request of
the i will. In the e^d of this verse is / a word i^ Ebrew Sela / the which of the
Ebricio^s is diversely interpretatid / Psalm. 4 but to pass over other
meani^ges / where so ever thou read it: think there is in the same verse some
special and notable thing to be markid. As is in this verse Sela here
signifithe asmouche in English as thowhe David had said / oh how great offense
is it before God / to pervert at any man's request justice. Or else David put
this word Sela there / as thowghe he had said / It is a commune fault / and
acustomid manner of judges to have respect of persons in judgment. The Psalm
conteinithe but 8. verses. The judges may the sooner learn them / and the better
bare them in mind.

The grettist thyffdomme of all is / Sacrilege in robbing of the gods
appointid to an holy use. The Gods appointid for the pour / for the
maintenance of scoles to bring up uthe in / in souche lerning as shall be
necessary for the ministry of the church / and governance of the commune
wealth.

Or in taking from the ministers the condition and Gods where upon the leave.
Who should by Gods laws honestly / be prouydyd for / by the hedes of the
commune we^lthe / 1. Thessal. 5. (...) an horrible offense to take these gods
away from the godly use they be apointid to: so is it the like offense to
enjoy them vndeseruyd. As those do that has hospitales / Spyttelles / and
other souche almose apointid for the pore / and aplie it to there own use /
the which criethe vengece before God. Also those that are apointid in Coleges /
or Scoles to learn / or teach for the stipend they receive / if they do not
there office commit sacrilege. Souche as live of spiritualltithes pensions /
lands / or other Gods appointyd to teach the people the word of God / and
minister his holy Sacraments / in neglecting there office and dewty / offend
in the same offense. Or when one man / and souche a one (which chansithe many
times that doothe not / or cannot do half amannis office for souche a place)
has many mennis liuinges. But of whatso ever yeftes he be of / he should not
have too mennis lyuynges which the Bishopes laws admit by pluralites / and
Totquotes / But this is clawe me and I will clawe the. If the bishopes
permittyd not there prystes to have too benefyces / it may fortune the pryst
would like wyce say / the Bishope should be bishop / but of one cite. and indede
so it should be. and until the Magistrates bring them to that point / it shall be
as possible to hyre a Byshope wade godly / and simple throwghe the scripture in
all cases of religion / as to drive a camel throwghe the ^ye of an nele*

A great petie it is to se / how far that office of a byshope is degeneratyd
from the oryginall in the scripture. It was not so at the begymyng / when
bishopes were at the best / as the Epistole of Paul to Tit. testifyythe / that
willyd him to ordain in every cite of Crete a bishop / Tit. 1. ca. And in case
there were souche love in them now as was then to wards the people / they
would say themselfes / there were more to do for the best of them in one cite /
then he could do. They know that the primatyue church had no souche bishopes
as be now a daie^ as examples testify until the time of Siluester the first.
alitle and alitle / riches crept so into the church that men sowghte more her
/ then the wealth of people. And so incresyd within few yers / that bishopes
be came princes / and princes were made servants. So that they have set the^
up with there almose and liberalite in so high honor: that they cannot pluke
them down again with all the forse they have. what blindnis is there befall
the worold that cannot se this palpable i will / that our mother the holy
church had at the beginning souche bishopes as did preach many godly
sermones in less time / then our bishopes horses be a brydeling. There
household was the scole / or treasure house of godd ministers / to serve the
word of god / and ministration of the sacraments. If it beso now / let every
indifferent man judge. The Magistrates that suffer thabuse of these gods / be
culpable of the fault. If the fourth part of the Byshop^rike remaynyd unto the
bishope it were sufficient. the third part to souche as should teach vthe good
lernyng. The second part to the pour of the diocesis. And the other to
maintain men of war for the save guard of the commune wealth: it were better
be stoyd a great deal. Ffor it is now i will vsyd / and be stowyd for the greatist
part upon those that has no need of it / or else upon souche i will men as should
be mayntainyd with noma^nis gods. It were well don to provide for souche as
be i will bryngi^g up / cannot now other wise live / and provide souche means /
that here after no more offend in that kind of life (...). if any man be
offendyd with me for my thus sayng / he louythe not his own health / nor
Gods laws / nor man's / out of which / I am allwaies ready / to prove the
thing said to be true. farther I speak it of love and of no hatred.

The acts of the Apostelles doothe show that in the primative church souche
as were conuertyd unto Christ vsyd a singular liberalite toward the pour:
and likewise other writers namely. S. Augustine. lib. 1. Deciuitate dei. that
many men were found rich in Rome when it was taken by the Goths / and again
within 14. year after by Geysericus the king of Vandale but they were rich for
the pour / and not for them selfs or souche as were rich / and makythe
mentyon of one Paulinus the bishope of Nole a cite in Ca^pania. That was
exsedi^g rich / but for the pour. as our bishopes should be / that now apply
the best part of there bishop rykes to a prodigal use in there own houses /
or in larg^fyes / and yeftes / hospitalite / and other benevolence upon the
ricche. let all men / yea they themselfes (affection put a part / and the love
/ or study of money) judge in this case whether ever they read in the new
testament / or have any one godly Byshope in the primatyue church for an
Example that vsyd the gods of the holy ghost / the riches of the pour / the
possessions yeuen for the preservation of godly doctrine / and the ministry
of the church as they do. Ff it seem godd unto the Higher poores that this i will
may be tolerable / and borne with all / for the honor of the realm / and
doings of souche expedicions as shall be expedient for them to do when they be
commaundyd.

There honors knowithe right well / that nothing commendithe A realm more /
then were every man in his degree / is as rich as the scripture of God
permittythe. and that bishope does most honor unto the realm / that kepythe
his household / and disposythe the same / according to the form / and rule of
the word of god / 1. Tim. 3. Tit. 1. asfor souche expedicions in the eiuile
wealth as should be committyd unto these ministers of the churge / the commune
treasure house should bare it. they should be reasonable provided for / and the
rest / and over plus taken from them and put to some other godly use. look
upon the Apostelles cheffelie / and upon all there successors for the space of
400. yers / and the^ thou shall se godd bishopes / and souche as diligently
applied that paynfull office of a bishope to the glory of god / and honor of
the realms the dwelt in. Thowghe they had not so mouche upon there heddes as
our bishopes has / yet had they more within there hedes / as the scriptures
/ and Histories testify for they applied all the wit they had unto the
vocation / and ministry of the church / whereunto they were called. our
Bishopes has so mouche wit they can rule and serve as they say in boothe
states. Of the church / and also in the Civil policy. When one of them is
more then any man is able to satisfy / let him do all ways his best dilige^s.
If he be so necessary for the court / that in civil causes and gyuing of godd
counsel he can not be spared: let him use that vocation and leave the other /
for it is not possible he should do boothe well. And a great over sight of the
princes / and Higher poures of the Earth thus to charge them with too bourdens
/ when none of them is able to bare the lest of them boothe. They be the kings
subjects and mete for his majesty to chose the best for his court that be of
the realm / but then they must be kept in there vocation to preach only the
word of God / and not to put them selfs or be apoyntid by other to do thing it
belongythe not to a bishopes vocation.

This is thyffte of souche gods as appartayne unto the body.

There is an other kind of the soul / as when the ministers give not unto
souche as be committyd unto there charge the word of God / simple / and
plainlye in atong known / and led not the people to wards the lyffe
everlasting as the word of god teathythe. to know that for christ's sake only
with out all respect of works / sin is for yeuen / and that we are bound to
do the works that God commaundithe us to do / and be expressyd in the
scripture. which is the regle and rule to lead the church by / Io. 15. Souche
as preach mannis laws and works / not commaundid in the scripture robbithe
the scripture of here riches. like wyce those that attribute more then is dew
/ or less then is dew / unto the holy Sacraments institutyd by Christ
co^mittithe sacrilege. They take from the sacraments to mouche / that say they
be but external signs to know the church of christ by / from souche as be
not of the church. As the Roman ons was known from an other citicene by his
gown. or those that say they may be done and leffte undone as it pleacythe man
/ that vsyth them. They add to mouche to the sacraments that attribute
asmouche unto them / as unto the grace and promis that they confyrme. As to the
Sacrament of Baptism remission of sin / when it is but an external
confirmation of it Romans 4. and unto the holy supper of the lord they attribute
a distribution delyueraunce or exhibition of Christ's natural body / where as
it is but a confirmation of the grace / and mercy that he bowght for us upon
the cross / with sheddi^g his pretio^s blud / and death of his innocent body
/ as the words shewithe plainly Luc. 22. 1. Co. 11. where christ says / he
did not institute his last supper / that me^ should bodily eat his body: but
that they should do all ways the same / in the remembrance of his death. And
consider the grace / that he optainid for us in his body and blud / and be
tha^kfull for the same. Great petie it is / that the devil has so preuailid
in many me^ / that obstinatlie without reason / and auctorie of the scripture /
preach there fantasies unto the people of God / and would persuade that there
ymagination / or dreme of christ's holy body / were a true / and substa^ciall
body. but souche is the devil is malice. now that many me^ ar perswadid that
the substance of bred remainithe / and can no le^ger deceive the^ in sensible
things: he carithe them to as great an i will / or wors the^ that / and would make
them be live that a fantasy / or dreme of a body / that has nether
quantite / nor qualite to be a true body. my good reader without all affection
consider the reasons / and auctorite of gods word / that I shall rehearse hyre
bryuely against those thiues that robb the humanite of christ of all humane
qualites and quantites. Ffyrst they judge the body of christ / that is in
heaven to have all properties / and conditions of a true man. and of the same
self body in the sacrament / they take a way all the conditions / and qualites
of a true mannis body.

They must show by the scripture. that one / and the same body / Jesus of
Nazarethe the sede of the holy virgin perfet god / perfet man / consisting of
man's flesh / and a reasonable solle has / and has not / at one / and the
same time abodye with all dimensions / qualites / and quantites of a true man
in heaven / and with out all dimensions / qualites / and quantites at the same
time in the sacrament. This put as apyller / and fondation of thy faith / that
as he is a perfete God / with all the properties / and conditions of a true God
/ where so ever he be. so is he perfet man / with all the qualites of a true
man were so heuer he be / consistyng of a reasonable soul / and man's flesh /
Io. 1. Ebr. 1. They say thou must not judge so carnally and grossly of
christis body. belyue thou the scripture / and bid them show the / the place
in the scripture that thou should not judge so of a true physical / and
mathematical body which christ now has / as the fyngers of S. Thomas
barythe. record / Joan. 21. the hands / and Iyes of all the Apostelles / 1.
Io. 1. and also his ascension barythe record / Act. 1. let them prove / that
they speak / by the scripture and show where christ was ever present in one
place visible / and in an other place present at the same time / invisible.

They say / we must speak as the scripture speakithe / that says by the
bread Mat. 26. Marc. 14. Luc. 22. this is my body: and of these few words i will
under stond they dream wounderfull mysteries / that the substanciall body of
christ's humanite is present / by miracle / and away celestial / passing all
me^nis capacites. with many other for fet imaginations and new found terms /
which the scripture never knew of. how be it / if thou mark there conclusion
thou shall find nothing but the name of a body which they have yeue^ to this
chimere / ad monstre that there phanthasie has conceuid. They speak of the
letter: and none goithe farther from it then they. Christ said: This is my
body that is betrayed for yo^. the which was a visible and sensible body as
the Iyes of those that saw him hang upon the cross / testify. They say it
is an i^uisible body that ocopyythe no place: but the scripture says the the
contrary as thou seist By the words of the supper / Luc. 22.

Hold them therefore by the scripture fast / and when they name the most holy
humanite of Christ / and would have it with the bred. bid the^ show the / the
body. for the text says that he shall cum as visible unto us as he departed
from us / Act. 1. if they say / that place speakithe / of his coming to
judgment and not of his presence in the Sacrament deny there sayng. For the
text says that he shall be in heaven till that time of judgment / Act. 3.

It is i will done of any man to speak as the scripture speakythe / and not to
take the meaning of the Scripture. God of his mercy give men grace to know the
trewthe. Before Christ in his supper called the bred his body: se how he fore
saw this after i will / and fantastical dreams / that me^ would take his
words / contrary onto his mind. In the 6. of Joan. he tellithe his disciples /
that to eat his body / was to belyue in him. That avaylid not / but straight
way said / the words that I speak be sprit and liefe: and called them from
the letter. Yet again the third time in the same place says / what if ye se
the son of man asce^d where as he was first. By these reasones he took away
all bodily eating / and rigure of the letter. like wyce after the supper / lest
they should dreme yet of abodely presence / Because Sacramentally he called the
bred his body he repetid again the same words / Joan. 16. It is expedient
that I depart. Again / I go to my father. I came from my father into the
worold. I for sake the worold again / and go to my father. Why should not these
places hold there autorite / and teach us to understand these words / this is
my body. seeing that boothe before / and after the supper / christ told them be
plain words / he would not be in the worold. and so does institution of it
declare / That this Sacrament was / and should be a memory of his blessed
passion / and pains suffryd in the flesh: and not a distribution of the
flesh it self / Luce. 22.1. Corinth. 11. None of them that put this corporal
presence in the bred yet hither unto / never could interpretat the words of
the supper aright. I would be glad to hyre it ons if they will not admit the
alteration of the bred with the Papists / they will / and can do no nether
wice / but interpretat the words thus. This is my body. That is to say / very
bred / and my body / and referr the verb (is) to too diverse substaunces. to
the body of Christ / and to the bred / which is plain against the nature of
a verb substantive / to be atron^ too diverse substantijs. Seeing Saint Paul
doothe interpretat / and expund this word (is) in the Sacrament of circumcision
(and all Sacraments be of one nature) by this word signifythe / or confirmithe
/ Roma. 4. what should men mean thus to troble and vex the church of Christ
with new doctrine. Also it is a commune manner of the Scripture / to attribute
unto the sign / the thing meant by the sign. God knowithe / what a weak
reason this is to say people must speak as the Scripture doothe / and would
prove there by / a real / and bodily presence of our savior that died for us
/ and ascendyd into heaven. Syttythe at the right hand of god all myghtie. And
from thens shall com to judge the quyck / and the ded. did not Arrius defend
his heresy with as good an argument as this / when he spoke as the scripture
do the / and said: Pater mayor me est. My father is greather then I. Or might
not aman prove by the same reason / that Elie / Esaie / and all other Prophets
/ before Christ came / to be deseauers of the people / and false preachers. For
Christ said / Io. 10. as ma^^ as came before me werethiffes and murderers he
that spekithe thus spekithe as the scripture spekithe. there is not / nor never
was chrystiane Reader / Heretic but spoke in the defense of his heresy / as
the Scripture speakythe. But took not the meaning with the word / as we must
do except we intend to robb the holy scripture of here true sense and ungodly
forse the letter / from the true meaning thereof: as those do / that rather
constrayne the vnlernyd conscience with fere: then persuade them / with godd
Arguments out of the Scripture.

They intricat the wyttis of men with sophistre and illusion that the know not
what they hyre / nether they them selfs what they say when the oration is
endid. for a true body / they show a blancke shadow / or rather fantasy of
a body and all there words has browght forth nothing less then a body
that they promessid to deliver unto him that they would persuade. As those that
Horace spekythe of: Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. They say he that
beliuithe not there words that they have atrew body with: Hoc est corpus
meum. Was never well perswadid of the first article of his faith / scilicet, I
must beliue that God is omnipotent. so we do. But with this reason they
subvert them selfs. Because ye se in the Sacrament God doothe not make the
thing they speak / and therefore it is not there / for if he would it should be:
it must be a man's body with all the qualites thereof / for Christ has none
other body / but that he took of the holy virgin / and is allwaies visible
and subject unto the senses whereso ever it be / Joan. 21.1. Joan. 1.

When they troble the with the words of the supper (this is my body) return
unto all the sacraments of the old Testament / Gene. 17. Exo. 12. and thou
shall find that they were the conconfirmations of the things they were callid
and not the thing it self / Roman. 4. Then look upon other places of the
Scripture / Joan. 6.16. Marc. 16. Luc. 24. Act. 1.3.7. belyue thy credo. He
ascendid into heuens / Syttythe at the right hand of God the father all mighty
from thense shall cum to judge the live and the ded. Woult thou not beliue all
these places / as well as the dream of them that Cholythe the with one place
/ of the Scripture i will vndrestand. Let those intractable men judge / what they
list of the Sacrament and holy supper of the lord. Beliue thou with the
Scripture that it is but a memory of Christ death: a confirmation and mystery
of our redemption / Luce. 22. 1. Corinthians. 11. Luc. says / do it in the
memory of me / and lest any man should say that memory is to receive the
corporal body of Christ Saint Paul. 1. Corinthians. 11. interpretatytht it
plainly and says the eathing of the bred / and drinkyng of the win is done
to show the death an passion of Christ's body / till be cum.

We must therefore in this kind of thifft / and all other: study to make
restitution / and to pay every man his as it is wroten in the law / and
Prophets / Exodus 22. Esa. 3. Amos. 3. Luce 10. of the which restitution
writithe Saint Augustine. ad Macedonium Epistol. 54. The which noman should
prolong / nor comme^d the doing thereof unto his exequutors but he that has
committyd the fault must make the menni^ in this case / unto him that he has
deceauyd. If thou can not remember whom / nether how mouche thou have
defraudid: let that be thy daily studij to call to remembrance sum way as
well to restore the Gods i will gotten / as thou foundist means to optaine them.
And be no more ashamyd to return to grace / the^ thou were to lost it. If thou
find no persons to who^ thou should restore it / give it to the pour / and
not to souche as shall sing Requiem for the after thy death. And give no
less then thou have taken away.

The gods that be trewlie thine / thou shall use aright if thou observe these
too rules

First if thou put no trust in them. Red the 61. Psalm / Matthew. 6. 1. Tim. 6.

Second if thou use the^ to the honor of God. to the necessite of this present
lieffe without excess. moderately with thy friends for humanite / and
abundantly with the pour for cherite. so shall thou have I nowghe / and
leave I nowghe as Abraham did to his son Isaac.

Caput XII. The nynthe Commandment.
Thou shall be no fase wittenys against thy neighbor.
IN the eyghthe Commandment ye se how God bound the hands of man from
robbyng of his neighbors Gods the which is / as it were a ma^acle or hand
sacle / to keep them from doing of i will.

So does he in this nynthe commandment bridle the tongue / from hurting his
neighbor. Which is if it be well vsyd the most precious membre of man. if
the contrary most detestable / and pernicious / an i will incorrigible / full of
pestiferous poisonne. Ioc. 3. this precept co^mau^dithe a moderation of the
tongue and requirithe the truithe allwaies to be said as occasion requirithe /
that no man hurt his neighbor which may happen where this law is neglectid
many ways. In the soul / in the body / in his name / or in his Gods. an is
committid either by word / writings / simulation / dissimulation / or be any
other beck or sign / which ar all there for biddi^. likewice that noma^
being called to bare testimony in any matter should spek other / the^ the
truithe. for he that is a false wittnys offendi the boothe against God and his
neighbor. Here is for biddin all kind of lies that be contrary to cherite.
There be three kinds of lies.

The first men call iocosum mendatium. when in bording they merely speak of
things untrue that rather extend to exhiler at the company / the^ to any
man's harm. This kind of bording is not commendable among christian men that
should seek other means / to ocopy the time with all / and has more vice and
lightnis then vertew / and grauite.

The second sort of lies is called mendatium officiosum. and is requirid / when
otherewyce i will / or murder cannot be avoydid as ye read Exodus 1. where the
mydwyues being commaundyd of Pharo to kill all the males among the Israelites /
at the time of there birth / said the women of the Ebrewes were deliuerid
before they came to the^. 1. Sam. 19. Michol David wieffe by the same meanis
sauid David. So did Ionathas cap. 20. David in the 21. by this means optaynid
bred of Ahimelech the High prist in Nobe. and avoidid the hands of Achis the
king of Gath. The third kind is called me^dac^^^ perniciosum. a pernicious and
hurtful kind of lying that cummythe of malice / hatred / envy or disdain and
extendithe to the hurt of his neighbor. this kind is damnable whether it be in
civil causes / or matters of religion. spetially to be abhorryd in divines and
preachers of the church that cause men to err from the way of salvation
tawght us by the scripture. and to bring people from the old lerning of the
Patriarchs / prophets / and Apostelles / to the new lernyng of men. from our
mother the holy church and the spouse of Christ Ephesians. 5. from a church buldyd
upon the doctrine / and fundation of the Prophetis / and Apostelles Ephe. 2.
unto the synagoge of the devil / buld upon the doctrine of Antechrist. Here is
for bydden all things that hurtythe / and not the thing that can honestly and
cheritable profet the truythe / and a good cause.

This law extendithe against those that by any false means contend in judgment
to over com a right cause / or molest an honest person with slanders / and
lies. or souche as feign untrue accusatione / and crimes against any man. Who
is not only damnyd by this law of God / but also by the law of man. For when
an ungodly / and malicious person is suffryd to lie and speak what he
lystythe vnpunyshyd / there is nothing more pernicious in the worold to make
debate and to break cherite. therefore not only Gods laws requirythe the
slaunderer to be punyshyd with the same pain that is dew for the offense that
falselye he has accusyd his brother of / Deuteronomy. 19. Matthew. 7. Luc. 6. But also
by the law of the 12. tables in Rome. August. de Ciuit. libr. 21. cap. 11.
Instit. lib. 4. Tit. 18. libr. Pandect. de ijs qui infamiam irrogant,
slaunderours be not vnpunishyd. likewyce those that secratly intend dissension
/ or debate between persons / and barers of tales / that they the^ selfs have
fainyd out of there own malicious interpretyng of a thing done to a godd
purpose / or the words spoken to an honest end / contrary to the true meaning
of the^. Against souche spekythe. S. Aug. de ciuit. lib. 19. cap. 6. qui ponit
in iudicio debet poenam similem sustinere, quamuis sint uera, quia occulta
manifestanda non sunt. that is to say he that propounythe the thing he cannot
prove / thowghe it be true / he should suffer the like pain him self / for
things secreat should not be opened. Vndrestond that if the matter apertayne
unto God / cherite / the gouerners of the commune wealth / or unto the commune
wealth it self: then should the i will cheritable be opened / if it cannot be
secreatlie remedyd. Deuteronomy. 13.

Here is for bydden all flattery and curyng of favor. An i will that destroythe /
cite / and worold Raignythe in Moses cheyre / in the court of princes / and
every pryuate house. where as men carythe not so they may keep them selfs in
favor or com into favor what the preace / or what they dispreace. So it
pleace there masters / these Parasites / and servile sort of men hold up I /
and nay as the wynd blowithe. which is of all seruytudes the greatist. It is
not without cause that so many wysmen has yeuen counsel to be ware of this
pestiferous kind of people. Cato Cum quis te laudat iudex tuus esse memento.
That is to say if any man preacethe / remember to be thine own judge. Cic. de
Offic 1. Cauendum est ne assentatoribus patefaciamus aures, ne adulari nos
sinamus. that is to say / we must beware we open not our ears to souche as
pre^sythe us falsely / and not suffer our selfs to be slatteryd. None be so
mouche in danger of these i will men / and dangerous sin as the princes nobles
/ and superioure poures of the earth. therefore Ovid. says: Agmen adulantum
media procedit in aula. that is to say. The Cluster of flatterers walk in the
mids of the court.

To this inhonest and fylthy gain either poverty / or auaryce storithe them as
Cic. writithe ad Heren. lib. 4. Duae res sunt quae possunt homines ad turpe
compendium commouere, in opia atque auaritia.

Ffarther there is here for byddin the judge to admit / or any man to offer in
judgment / any partial / fore wrowght / or condudyd / cause. in case it be
known: the person accusyd / may appele to a higher judge and refuse the
testimonies / that speak of hatred / or being corruptyd other ways by love /
or money / whether it be all redye paid / or yet to be paid / Cod. lib. 4. Tit.
20. when the law says thou shall not answer as a false wyttnis against thy
neighbor / it declarythe that it is lawful to show the truythe when he is
requiryd which co^demnythe the opinion of those / that think it not lawful
for a Chrystiane man / to contend in any cause / before the civil Magistrates
of the Earth. Remember those 4. things in yeuing of testimony / and then thou
shall not offend. Ffyrst remember God / and the truythe / and do for them
asmouche as thou may. 2. Put a part all affections / fere / love / and
hatred. Consider what the cause / is / and not who is the cause is. if any man
speak godd / or i will / keep one ear stoppyd with thy finger / and here him that
speakythe with the other. So did Alexander the great. and when he was
demaundid why he did so: he said he kept the one ear close / to hyre the other
part. And that is the greatist testimony that any man can have to commend his
wisdomme / and so we be commaundid Exodus 23. Leuit. 19. read the chapter. 3.
se thou feign nothing / nor add nothing / to the cause whether it be godd / or
bad. as the Pharisees did against Christ / and his holy Martyr. S. Steven. 4.
se thou hyde nothing / nor dissemble / but speak platle / and plainly asmouche
as thou knowist. if thou observe not these. 4. things it is not only thyffte
against cherite / but also sacrilege against God. Which he abhorrythe Prouer.
6. read the cap. and shall not be vnpunishid. Deuteronomy. 19. cap. read the place.
The end of this precept is that we use in all things a simple verite to wards
all men / without fraud / deceat / or gyle in word / and deed. and all that is
before spoken in many words / the sum and hole is / that we uiolat not / nor
hurt with slanderous words / calumniat not the thing well spoken or done /
nor other ways / our brothers name / but be glad in all things / to promote
him / bo^the in Gods / and fame.

Caput XIII. The Tenthe commandment.
Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house / nether desire thy neighbors wiffe
/ either his man servant / either his woman servant / either his or / either his
Asseether onything that is thy neighbors.
ASmouche as is necessary for man to live an up right and godly lyffe in
this worold boothe to wards god and man is repetyd in the Nynne
commandments before if they be obseruyd accordin to there institution / and
mid of almighty the yeuer of the same. As he desyrithe all thexternall acts
of man to extend unto the glory of god / and utilite of our neighbor: so
doothe he in this last precept require / that the mind and solle of man be
replenyshid with all affections and disyre of love and cherite / That what so
ever we do / it be done with out vain glory / and hypocrysye from the heart /
not showing one thing vttwardlie / and have an other secreatlie in the heart.
and this commandment is referryd to all the other as Christ says Matthew. 5.
Thowghe the words of the commandment make mencyon only of the concupiscens
of souche things as be our neighbors possession. As his house / his wiefe
with other souche Gods as be his. and in this precept is declared spetially
our infirmite / and weakenis that we are all miserable sinners Roman. 7. for
never was there / or ever shall be / only Christ exceptyd but offendyd in this
precept / to what perfection or degree of holinys so ever he came unto. No
creature born into the worold could satisfy this law / and all holy sayncts
had sin remaynyng in them as long they lyuyd Psalm. 14.2.1. Joan. 1. Rpm. 7.
1. Cor. 4. Psalm. 129.16.31. Job. 9. Exodus 34. of the which places we may lern
to call for the great / and inestimable help of God that we may be quit / and
sauyd from this imperfection / in Christ Jesus / and accomptyd in him the
children of God and satisfiers of the law Roman. 8. for by this law is requyryd
souche a cherite / and sincere love toward God / and man: that the mind should
not have asmouche as any contrary motion / or any resistaunce at all / to
stayne the glory / and bewtye of this love. Which comprehendyth all those
commandments a fore rehersyd as Christ says Matthew. 22. Marc. 12. and like
wyce Matthew. 7. all things that ye would men should do to you / the same do ye
to them. This is the law / and the prophets. So that by these words ye may
know what is the scope and end of the law. trewlye none other thing then to
bring men to justice and honesty of liffe / and to make him lik unto the law /
and so unto almighty God / who is ymayge the law expressythe. and the more
man conformythe him self to live after the law / the more resemblythe the
almighty God yeuer of the law. Moses when he would bruely call unto
remembrance the sum of Gods laws says / Et nunc Israel quid petit abs te
Dominus Deus tuus, nisi ut timeas Dominum, and ambules in uijs eius: diligas
eum, ac seruias ei in toto cord, and tota anima, custodiasque mandata eius,
Deuteronomy. 20. That is to say / Therefore now Israel what does the lord / thy God
ask of the / saving that thou should fere the lord / and walk in his
commandments / love him / and serve him / with all thy heart / and lieffe /
and to keep his commandments. and repetythe the same words again. 22. cap.
the law would that our hearts should be replenyshid with the love of God. of
the which love prosedithe the love to wards our neighbor as Paul writithe
1. Tim. 1. The occasion of all hatred that we bare unto God / his holy word /
and our neighbor / is the love of oureselfes / and the vanite of this
worold. In this Commandment is not only forbid theffect of i will / but also
thaffect and desire toward i will. Not only thaffect / lust / concupiscens /
prones / inclination / desire and appetite toward i will: but also when man is
most destitute of sin / and moostfull of vertew: most ferrist from ^he
devil / and nerist to God: out of hell / and in heaven / Philippens. 3. Yet is
his works so vnperfeyt / that if it were not for the fre / liberal / and
merciful imputation of justice in Christ Jesus man were damnyd / Romans 7.8.
Psalm. 143. He that considerithe this precept well / shall the better perceive
the greatnys of gods infinite mercy: and vndrestand the article and doctrine
of fre justification by faith. For all thowghe grace prevent the doing of godd
/ and folowit never so mouche / yet is the work vnperfet / and satisfyythe not
the perfection of the law. only it is Christ's merits that we be sauyd by.
the which article the devil most enuyythe / and goithe about to oppress as
mouche as is possible. Confess thy self thermore in thy most perfection and
say: lord God have petie and compassion upon me always / and for ever: thy
vnprofetable servant / L^. 17. and when thou speakyst of grace / remember is is
not only the fre giffte of God to prevent the in doing well / and to follow the
in the same / but also fre imputation of lieffe eternal which thou can not
merit nether with grace / nether without grace. For as I said before to what
perfection so ever thou be com unto: this law accusithe the. Thou shall no
couyt. But be cause thou trowist / and beliue in Christ Jesus thou shall be
sauyd / Joan. 3.4.5.6. and where as the law promisythe nothing but upon souche
condition as we perform it to the vttermust / Christ Jesus take the from here /
the rigure and extremite of here justice in us / and laythe it upon himself.
So that the bliss eternal that the law promisythe for works: God yeuythe
unto us by grace / for his sake that only satisfied the law Christ Jesus /
Roman. 5 Ephesians. 1. Colloss. 1. Galat. 4. And in this Argument of fre
justification wrytythe / Saynct Paul in the leven first chapiters in the
Episto. to the To. where as in the 4. he puttythe Abraham for an example that
is the father of all belyuers. in whom we may see how the friends of God ar
justified / or obtain the favor of God. And says that Abraham was iustied
by faith / Genes. 15. and before circumsition. Whereas thou seyst / too
things.

One that the vncircumcysyd was justified* the other that noman was justified
By the merits / or bentfites of the Sacrament. Like wyce he was promisyd to be
the here of the worold because of him should be born Christ Jesus the lord of the
worold / Id credidit, non per Legem meruit.

This he beliuyd / and not by the law merytyd / Galat. 3. an other reason
Paul alegythe that Abraham / and all other ar justified by faith.

It is not possible that the promise of God should be irritatyd or made vain:
but if it dependyth of the justice of the law / it could not be certain.
therefore addithe he / freely by faith. which faith in optaining remission of
sin beholdithe only the mercy of God in Christ Jesus / and lokithe upon none
other merits. Yet mark more: he says that grace is the heritayge of the
belyuer / by the justice of faith / Roman. 4. Then it is no merit. Haeredes
nascimur, non emimus. We are born here is / and bye it not as those say that
attribute remission of sin to works or Sacraments which doothe testifye or
confyrme / the friends of God / and not make them Gods friends / Roman. 4.

Thus thou seist what the law is / how thou or bound studiously to obey it /
and how it is fulfyllyd in Christ Jesus / who is justice is thine / If thou
belyue in him / as thowghe thou had perfetlie satisfied the Law thy self.

Certanne objections that kepythe man from the obedience of Gods laws solutyd
Caput XIIII. 1. Of time / and place.
AS it is the manner of all Orators not only to stablishe the matter they
entreat of / with souche reasones / Arguments / and probations as best may
confyrme / and stablishe there purpose / but also ad souche reasones / as may
inclinthe herers to favor the thing spoken: and like wyce leauein there minds
souche perswations / as might in manner prycke them forth / and beforse
constrayne them to put in effect and practyse the thing spoken of / and then to
remove souche impedimentes / and break the forse of souche contrary
Arguments / as may be obiectyd to let the thing / the would optayneand prove.
So doothe Moses in the book of Deuteronom. as thou hardist before / leave no
Argument nor reason unspoken of / that might excitat / store up / provoke and
forse us to the love / obedience / and execution of Gods Laws / as the 28.
chapit. of Deuterono. shewithe. In the 29. and 30. he remouythe all the
objections / impedimentes / and lettys that with oldythe us from the obedience
/ and doing of Gods Laws.

The first Sophisme or carnal objection is when men say it is no place / nor
time now to learn / or obey the word of God / we be not in amonasterie / in the
scole / or in the temple: we be in the broad worold / and must do as other men
do and rather serve the place we be in / and ululare cum Lupis. Bark with the
Wulfe / then speak of the Scripture. so does they reason of time likewyce.
now it is to dangerous a season to reason any matters / let it pass till he
worold be more quiet / and souche like. As the Israelites might have said to
Moses that co^maundid to observe this law when they came into the la^d of
Canaan.

We obseruid not these precepts in the wildernys / wherefore then more in
Canaan. we kept them not for the space of 40. yers / no more will we here
affter. This objection he breakythe / and prouithe that the law should be
allwaies obseruid / and in every place: and shewithe how the observation of the
law was rewardyd / and the neglectyng of it punishyd. And declarithe the same
by examples. God fed his friends in the desert by miracle from heaven / and
preseruyd all there apparel that it consumyd not / nor peeyshyd in the waring
/ for the space of 40. yers. Then of Pharao and the too great Kings of Hesbon
/ and Basan. Sehon / and Og.

Caput XV. 2. Exception of persons.
THe second objection is / when men put from them selfs the obedience of the
law unto other. Saing. let the Prystes / and Monckes keep the law and le^rne
it. what should a Prince / Magistrate / or Gentle man be bound to learn and keep
all those holy rules. farther / vthe cannot be tied to so straight canonnes it
must not so be brydelyd.

Souche as be parkyd in / with high wales and separatyd from the worold must
observe these Commandments of God. This wicked acceptance of persons.
Moses destroythe / and most Godly repetythe and numbrythe the members of the
church / the orders / and decrees of the same. Repetythe the words of the
aliaunce. Sayng: Vos omnes hodie statis coram domino Deo uestro. Principes
uestri, tribus uestre, Seniores uestri, Praefecti uestri atque omnes uiri
Israel. Paruuli quoque uestri, uxores uestrae, and Peregriuus tuus etc^. That
is to say / All ye this day stand before the lord your God / your Princes /
your trybes / your Elders / your Officers / and all men of Israel. Your
Children / your Wieues / and thy Gest. and so forth / Read the place. And why
they stood before the lord / the text dyclarythe. To enter aliaunce with him.
No manner of person is excludyd from the lege. Whereby we know as Gods mercy is
commune for all men / which is the first part of the condition expressyd in
the lege so a like is the obedience toward the law requiryd of all men:
specially of souche as be the gouerners of the people in the ministry of the
church / or else in the governance of the commune wealth. If the Preacher be
ignorant of Gods word / and of a dissolute liefe what Godlinies or vertew can
there be in his herers. If the King / Prince / Magistrate / or Rulers of the
commune wealth / nor know gods laws / nor follow justice / equite /
temperancye / nor sobriety / What honestye or vertew can they look to have in
there subjects. They must give example of all vertew. Let them beware betyme
that use these objections / for if they thick to have God for there God / let
them observe his aliaunce. For he will punish the transgressoure with our
respect of persons who so ever it be.

Caput XVI. 3. Presumption.
THe third objection / or Satanicall sophisme is presumption or securite of
Gods will / when men knowithe what is to be done yet against his knolege
presuming of Gods mercy does the thing that is i will. This horrible sin
extendithe wounders far. The One sittithe in judgment and falsely iudgithe. The
other clymmithe to honor / and riches by flattery / usury / simonye / extorsion
/ fraud / and pylling of the pour. The other holdythe in the truithe to
bespoken / and lettythe out the lies that should be kept i^: with all souche
other like vices / as reign now aday in the worold. They hyre by the words of
God / that those isles and abominations be cursid of God / yet hope they the
contrary and think yet to have Gods favor / as the text says* Deuteronomy. 29.
read and mark it: Cum audierie uerba iuramenti huius, benedicat sibi in cord
suo dicens: pax erit mihi, etia^ si incessero in imaginatione cordis mei, ut
addat ebriam sitienti. That is to say / when he hyrythe the words of this oath
(where God swerithe to punish the i will Deuteronomy. 28.) he promisythe godd to him
self / sayng in his heart / yea if I walk in the ymagination of my heart / and
take my pleasure there is no danger. This diabolical presumption is thoccation
that men not only fall into diverse kinds of abomination / but all so
persevere in the same i will. let every man judge his own conscie^s and se.
Against the word of God he takythe hope / as it semythe him of Gods mercy /
which is no hope at all / but the very with / and halter of the devil to
strangle at length him / that is this perswadid in this i will / and dangerous
opinion. They think it is faith / where as it is very arrogance / a true
knolege of God / when it is but adeuyllysh illusion / and false opynion of man
as it aperythe in the same place by Moses words Non agnoscit Dominus ut
propitietur ei, sed fumabit tunc furor Domini, and zelus eius in uiru^ istum,
and cubabit super eum omnis maledictio, quae scripta est in libro isto,
delebitque Dominus nomen eius sub coelo, Deuteronomy. 29, that is to say / the lord
will not favor him / but then be anger / and kendle his Ire against this man /
so that every malediction wroten in this book shall rest upon him / and the
lord shall destroy his name under heaven. Read the place / and lern to a vayde
souche securite and sinister judgment of god and his nature. The original /
and fontaine from whe^s this presumption springithe is ignora^cie / and a trust
in other men^es vertewes for whois merits the think to be sauid. So^me say
they have Angellis / and Archa^gellis / and many other holy saynctes in heaven
that commend there salvation to God. An other trustythe to souche works as may
be done upon the earth for him / and he do nothing him self but live as he
list in a vain hope / to have solace in iniquite. This great offense is
noryshyd diverse Ways. first when men judge not aright of Gods nature that he
is as anger with sin as the scripture says. The second when men judge
amiss of Gods works. When they se / he punishyd one for sin / he thynkythe
not that the same punysment apertaynythe unto him. Moses teachyth / and
settythe before the people the works of God / his wounders and meruelles done
in Egypt / in the cites of Sedom / and Aemora / Adma and Zeboijm the which
the lord subuertyd in his Ire / and fury and said these works only punyshyd
not those that offendyd / but also should teach all other men to avoyde Gods
displeasure: for to that end miracles of punysmentes be don / as Christ says
Luc. 13. to fore warn men of the i will to com. and thus has he all ways
called men to penance. If they would still be nawght / a lenghe he punyshyd
cruellye / as not only the holy Histories of the Bible testify where as ye se
kings / and kingdoms / changyd and destroyed / but also in profane writers ye
shall se / by what miracles God called the Magistrates / and people of the
commune wealth to repentance. Titus Liuius libro tertio de secundo bello
Punico writyt he that an ox caluyd a horse. in the 7. book a Pigg varryd with
a mannis mouth. and a child borne with an Elephantes head. Valerius wrytythe
lib. 1. ca. 4. that a Mare folyd a Hare in the king of the Persians camp
called Xerxes. Who as sum writers record / browght against the Atheniens
1700000. men of war. Whom Themistocles the Capitane of the Greeks over came in
the Sea. Herod. wrytythe this History at large. Had king Xerxes consideryd the
work of god he might have lernyd that there was a god that would torn the
forse / and corayge of his horsemen / into the fere and timidite of the timorous
/ and ferefull hare. Liuius lib. 3. de vrbis origin writithe how the heavens
burnyd / and deuidid it self in too li. 2. de 2. bello Punico. the sea ba^kes
burnid. The son was seen to fight with the Moon. and like wice too Mones to
be see^ in the day. lib. 3. he says that the Sea burnyd. These supernatural
works might have tawght the people of those days amendment of lief had they
not been blind as we be that never take profet by any work of God / other wyce
the^ to eat the reue^wes of the earth as the brute bestes of the same. nor no
more knolege of god by the motions of the heavens then the ox / or horse / that
like wyce see them / and yet nether the wyser nether the better. if we markyd
the 8. and 19. Psalm. we should know they were made to an other end. The
gentiles shame us / all a way thar lernid by the revolution of the year that
nothing was durable in this mortal lyffe Horat. Carmi. lib. 4. Immortalia ne
speres monetannus, and almum

Quae rapit hora diem. The third reason is that men judge amiss of Gods
promisis that says he will punyshe doutles for sin all manner of people / be
they never so strong as the prophetis all ways testify / Hier. in espetiall.
He said if the people conuertyd not from there doing of i will / God would keep
promese with them / and destroy there land. but they belyuyd it not but said.
Templum domini, Templum domini, Templum domini. The temple of God / the temple
of God / the temple of God. They iudgyd then as many do now aday when they se
there cites / and contre strong they think it is not possible to be ouercom.
So thowghe the Troianes and deceauyd themselfes as the prophetie of Nerci fore
spoke. Post certas hyemes uret Achaicus
Ignis Iliacas domos.
Hor. Car. lib. 1. An other so estemythe the forse of the people and puttythe
there confidence in the same sayng / let this bablyng preacher say what a lift
God is not so cruel as he spekithe of. It shall cost many a broken head before
any enemy enter any parsell of our commune wealth. but trust to it if sin
be not banyshid / the Ire of God will find away in at last / and the deferring
thereof is only to call us to a better liefe and not that he is a sleep / or
aprouithe our i will lyffe. Romans 2. as thou feist example of the Israelites in the
land of Canaan which was passing strange / and the inhabitauntes thereof the
only commune wealth of God / as they said The temple of God / the temple of
God. yet at the last Nabucadnezer that thy lokyd not for was there destruction
Esai. 22. mark the punishment and the cause there of which was sin and
learn to be ware. tawght be an other man's i will.

Caput XVII. 4. Curiosite.
THe ffourthe let or impediment is curiosite and over mouche sarchyng the
pryuytes / and secreates of God when men of an i will / and licentious liefe
return not to penence as the scripture byddythe. But mountythe streighte way
into Gods providence and predestination. co^te^nynge the will of god that is
made open to him in the scripture / that god would him now to repent / and to
receive grace / Sarchithe to know the thing that never was made open to man or
angel the eue^t / and e^d of things to cu^. thus reasonithe with him self /
who knowythe what his last hour shall be. wherefore fauorithe god the one / and
not the other. Some time the good makitbe an i will end / and the i will a godd. In
this opinion / and inscrutable mystery he werithe all his wits / and at the
end of his cogitacions / fyndithe more abstruse / and doutfull objections the^
at the beginning / so that he cummithe from this scole nether wyser nether
better Moses Deu. 29. remouithe this ungodly let / and impediment saing:
Secreta domini dei nostri reuelata sunt^ obis and filijs nostris usque in
seculum, ut faciamus omnia uerba legis huius. That is to say / the secreat of
the lord our Gdd ar made open unto us / and unto our children for ever / that
we do all the precepts of this law. The which words plainly conde^nithe
our folyshe / and audatious presumpsion that sekythe to know what shall happen
unto us in the hour of death / and will not know the thing that should be don
in all our lieffe^ to say that God would have us know the thing that is opened
unto us in the sceipture Gods mercy promised in Christ Jesus / and follow him in
all vertew. if we offend to repent / and leave sin then has he promisyd
mercy / and will give it as Moses says cap. 30. Deuteronomy. Do the thing that thou
art bed to do / and follow the will of God made open unto the in his word. as
for thy disputation of Gods providence is a curiosite / and no religion / a
presumpsion / and no faith / a let of vertew / and fartheraunce of vice. When
thou heryst penence spoken of / learn that lesson out of hand lest perauerture
thou be never good scoler in Theology / ot Gods laws. It farythe many times
with us that long go to scole in divinity / and yet never godd deuines / as it
farythe in the scole of Rethorike where as if at the beginning the scoler
profet not as Arist. says shall never ^e good oratoure. Therefore Moses says
in the 29. cap. Deuteronomy. Non dedit dominus uobis cor ad intelligendum et oculos ad
uidendu^, atque aures ad audiendum usque in presentem diem. That is to say /
God gave you not a heart to understand / Iyes to see / nor ears to hyre until
this present day. Here doothe Moses speak ironice / and semythe to deny / the
thing he would affirm. As Arist. or Cicero might say when they have applid all
there labor and done the best they ca^ to make there scolers lernyd yet
profetythe nothing. the^ depart out of the scole / and say unto there audience
I never opened unto you the scie^s that I towght you. Not that the fault was
in them / but in the auditors that / neglectyd there diligence and doctrine.
So doothe Moses now speak of God / not that the fault was in him / that those
unkind people under stood not the doctrine he towght / but in them selfs as
it apperithe in the text. for he uses now the rode of persequution /
punishythe them / betythe them / yea and killythe the^ because they would not
learn the thing he towghe them. Ffarther he shewythe that his pleasure was /
they should chose the godd and leave the i will / to be in wealth / and avaide the
woe / This argument he prouythe of his own nature / which is amiable / loving
/ and holy inclynyd to do well unto man / and to be at peace with him. But
because man of his own malice contemnythe the word / and doctrine of Go^ he is
not only rigurouse / and severe against man / but also he waxithe so anger for
sin as he that chafythe / and monythe him self that all men may preceaue be
his countenance he is offendyd. Therefore says the text. Fumabit furor
Domini, Deuteronomy. 29. that is to say / the fury of god shall smoke against the
sinner. Our gospellers be better lernyd then the holy ghost / for they
wyckydly attribute the cause of punishment / and aduersite to gods providence
which is the cau^^ of no i will / as he him self can do no i will. and of every
mischeffte that is do^ they say it was Gods ^ill. the holy ghost puttithe an
other cause as it is wroten here / Deu. 29. that is to say / Sin in man and
the contempt of his holy word. farther the pain is not inflictid by
predestination to lost man / but boothe predestination and the affliction
extendithe to call man from damnation / Ezech. 33. 1. Cor. 11. Psalm. 118. Apoc.
3. Esa. 26.28. Heb. 12. Prouer. 3. Mat. 11. Romans 11. Esa. 61. The blind soothe
saiers that writ of things to cu^ ar more to be estemid then these curiouse
and high climming wittis: for they attribute the cause of i will unto the i will
respects and sinistre conjunctions of the Planetes. Refuse not therefore the
grace of frid / nor ons receauid banishe it not with i will conversation. If we
fall / let us here almighty god that callithe us to repentance with his
word and return / let us not co^tinew in sin / nor hepe one sin upon the
other / lest at last we come to a contempt of God and his word / for remission
is promisid to asmony as repent as Moses shewithe in the 30. chap. Deuteronomy. and
like wyce all the scripture / and examples thereof. But remember what the text
says that thou must convert unto God / that by the means and mediation of
Christ / and that with all thy heart and then thou maiste find remedy. convert
not / to supersticion and by a Mass for thy sins / or lo^^ help of any
saint: but only of god as his wor^ teachithe / Joan. 15. for he that struck
the for sin can heal the again. Say not in aduersite as Cicero did: Nisi
quis Deus, uel casus aliquis sub uenerit, salui esse nequeamus, lib. 16. Epist.
148. For there is nothing in heaven nor earth that sauithe but God alone.

Caput XVIII. 5. Desperation.
THe fygthe let or impediment is desperation / when as men think they cannot
be sauyd / but ar excludid from all mercy. And this is not alight and small
let for men that has offendyd. And is contrary unto Presumption / for
presumption has sum simile and show of hope / for all thowghe man offend
the will of God / yet doothe he trust in the doing and perseueraunce of i will
that God will not punyshe.

The which impiete and wyckidnis / takythe from God his justice. Of the
contrary nature is desperation / it takythe from God his mercy. For when they
offend and continue in sin / they think there is no mercy leffte for them.
The which sin and blasphemy thus procedithe i^ man. the desparat person
has now his Iys in Gods justice / redithe / hyrithe / and seythe how cruelly
/ and with rigure he reuengythe the tra^sgression of his law. Beholdithe the
examples in whom God exequutid the same rigure and punishment / that his
conscience is oppressyd with all. considerithe his own strenghte / which is
prone unto nothing but unto i will. Seythe how difficile / and hard the things be
/ that God commaundithe / specially because of his accustom and long
contineaunce in sin.

This discurse / and progress in thacknolege of sin barythe him in hand that
it is impossible to return unto god. The^ doothe they for the more part
abrydge and shortynne there own days / or else chose an other kind of lyffe
then God appoyntythe in the Scripture. As Sardanapalus the last King of the
Assyriaunce prescribid at his death this rule to live by / and leffte the word
of God. of whom Justinius lib. 1. wrytythe.

Ede, bibe, lude, post mortem nulla uoluptas.
Cum te mortalem noris, presentibus exple
Delitijs animum, post mortem nulla uoluptas.
That is to say / Eat / drink / play / for after death there is no Joy.

Iuuenalis: Et Venere, and caenis, and plumis Sardanapali.

Moses like a godd phisicio^ teachithe a remedy against this dangerous diseace
/ and shewithe the way unto God / declarithe that God is full of mercy / and
ready to for give / and begynnithe his oration in this manner unto souche as be
afflictid / and oppressid with sin: Cumitaque uenerint super te omnia uerba
ista. That is to say / when there commithe upon the all those things /
Seuteron. 30. Read diligently the chapter and mark it. Moses says there
when God has afflictid the for thy sins and thou returnist unto him with
all thy heart: he shall deliver the from captivity and receive the to his mercy
again. of the which text learn this doctrine / that God will allwaies for
give how many / and how horrible / so ever the sins be / Romans 5. Ezechiel.
33. Romano. 11. Joan. 3. Mat. 11. and learn to fere of presumption and to
beware of desperation. God desyrithe thy obedience toward the law thowghe
thou can not fullfillid it. Like wyce he desirithe to do well unto the / and
not to punyshe the. Hieremi. 29. Read the place and also Esai. chapit. 49.
Luce. ^5. and se what paternall and more the^ fatherlye love god almighty
barithe unto all us miserable sinners in Christ Jesus his only son. Who is
ours be faith / which faith / solie / and only ledithe us to eternal
lieffe as Christ says / Io. 3. so the father louyd the worold that he would
give his only son for it / that all that belyue in him / cannot peryshe /
but has liefe ever lastyng / and so / Joan. 6. He that belyuythe in me has
ever lasting liefe.

But unto this way of lieffe (to Christ by faith) all men be not browght after
one sort. For as mannis lieffe is not mayntainid with one kind of mete / but
the childed with pappe / the full ayge with stronger meats / the elthe with
commune metes / the syckenis with souche as be of lighter digestion: so is it
in bryngyng man to faith in Christ Jesus our savior. one doctrine and
lerning cannot do it / because there be diverse sorts of people / in the
worold. Sum Hypocrites / that would justify them selfs by there works.

These know not the greatnis of sin / nether there own imperfection / nether
the damnation of God against sin / Joan. 16. This man should not have the fre
remission of sin in Christ Jesus preachyd unto him / but the law and ten
commandments / that by it / he learn first to know the horror of sin and
greatnis of Gods Ire against it.

An other sort live without all fere / and honesty / a filthy lieffe / as
well of those that confess the gospel / as those that hatihe it: those
because they know not the abomination of there sin / and the seuerite of
Gods anger against it / be not mete to have the gospel of remission of sin
preachyd unto them / but to be instructyd in the law / and rather browght to
afere of Gods punishment / that remainithe for all impenitent persons. they
should be excommunicatyd / and punishyd with the discipline of Gods word /
that first they might know there sin / and acknolege there damnation. Thus
Christ tawght the young man that trustid in his own works / Matthew. 19. Marc.
10. Luc. 18. because he was an Hypocryte / he preachyd not unto him the gospel
of fre remission of sin / but send him to the law and to the works thereof /
not that he meant man could fulfill the law / or justify him self by the
worckes thereof: or that Christ would not he should be part taker of his mercy /
but that the hypocrite might cum to acknolege of his sins / the Ire of God /
and damnation of him self by the law.

The which thing known / he should be constrainid of necessite / to syke his
salvation by faith in Christ Jesus / except he would peryshe in his sin.
Saint Paul did not bid the Corinthions preach faith and remission of sin
unto the adulterour that continewyd in sin: but bid them excommunicat him /
and as many as did like offense / and that no man should eat or drink with him
/ 1. Corinthians. 5.

But unto souche as know there sins / and be troblyd with the heuynys thereof
as David was / that said Psam. 38. Thy darts lord ar shut in me / and thy
hands oppressithe me. No part of my body fre from pain / because I have
synnyd. For I am drownyd in sin and the punishment there of is more wayghtie
then I can bare. The sores and wounds that thou have stryken me with all for
my sin / styncke / and spewithe out / fylthe and corruption for my
transgression / and so forth with a dolorous and lamentable oration. Read the
Psalm / it begynnythe / lord chastynne me not in thy Ire. There shall thou
learn true penitence. To him and souche like as the law has wrowghte here
office in / appertaynythe the preaching of the gospel / of remission of sin
/ and deliverance from Hell in Christ Jesus. So Christ preachyd unto Marie
Magdalynne Luce. 7. For as she had most grounslie offendid / so knew she here
self / and was afflictyd with the dolours of hell. when she came to Christ to
know the way to heaven / he send here not unto the law / for the law had first
done here office in here and made here aferd. Therefore pour wreche / she
hard thy sins be for given / and thy faith has sauyd the. There is an
other sort mete to hire the gospel / and not to be feryd with the law. To
say / souche as has trowghe Christ remission of there sin / and walkithe by
faith in the vocation of God / yet during this mortal liefe barithe about
with them / the relics and remanent of sin in there bodies. to these men
preachithe Saynct Paul the Gospel / Romans 8. Nulla condemnatio estijs, qui
insiti sunt Christo Jesus. That is to say: There is no condemnation unto them
that are graffyd in Christ Jesus / lest this man should to mouche sustain the
weight of the law as Paul makythe exclamation for fere of the rigure of it in
the 7. chap. Romans Farther unto this man it is also necessarij to me^gle the law
now / and then / to this end to keep him in his office / in the fere of God /
that by the law the affections of the flesh may be kept under / and by the
Gospel / may be preseruyd the sprit / and ardor of faith.

This is to preach in the church of God. Not to fere the sorrowful co^sciens
with the rigure of the law: nether to flatter those Hypocrites / Epicures /
and lascivious gospellers with the promise of faith / until souche time as
they amend / and the law done his office in the^. And in case preachers had
vsyd / and applied the scripture to the use it was wroten / and as there
auditors had need / there had never bin souche a soden / and horrible
defection from the gospel in many places as now we see.

Caput XIX. 6. Ignorance.
THe syxt let or impediment where with me^ excuse them selfs from the
obedience of the law of god / is the pretense of ignorauncie / the which they
think shall excuse them. Thus they say: the scripture has so many mysteries
in it self / and is to hard for our capasite. Some time the letter / sometime
the sprit / and sometime boothe must be under stand. farther they say the
doctors braule / and chyde between them selfs / and how should the vnlernid
understand it aright. Who can tell says an other whether this be the true law
or not. if it were the true law of god / then should it conteyne all verites /
and have no need of man's laws. Now the greatist part of souche as has the
name of Christiantie / say that Gods laws sauithe no man / instructithe noman
aright / no it is not wholesome for man / except it be help / and aiedid by the
law of the bishopes. thus the worold o with to the bishopes decres that have
called the auctorite of the holy testament / that contaynithe all trewthe (who
is sufficiency / and verite is sealyd with the precious blud of Christ) into
dout / and not into dout only / but clean abrogatyd it / and preferryd there
own laws. Confer there preachinges / and ministration of the Sacraments
with the Holy word / and law of God / and se. Other say I have no wit to
under stand the word of God / and if I had yet have I no leisure to learn it.
Against this objection Moses answerithe / and says this law is sufficient /
is simple / and plain / ease to be vndrestand / a perfet doctrine / and
requirid of all men. Thus he prouyth it. Preceptum istud quod ego praecipio
tibi hodie non est mirabiliter supra te, nec procul positum, Deuteronomy. 30. that is
to say the commandment that I prescribe unto the to day is not far above the
/ nor put far from the. Read the last half of the chapter. By the which
words it apperithe that God has made his will / and pleasure / simple / and
plainly open unto his people / with apt sentencis / and open words / and also
put the same nere unto us that we should not seek it with great danger of our
lieffe / to sail into the Indies for it / or look it in heaven a boue as those
that receive all things by revelation or apparitions of Angels / or othere
souche means. But Moses says it is no need of any souche Ambassadors / and
so faith Abraham Luc. 16. for man may learn out of the scripture what is to be
done / and what not to be done / what is the condition of the good / and of
the bad. No need to seek the knolege there of in Egypt / Athenes / or Rome.
Sed ual de propinquum est tibi uerbum, in ore tuo, and in cord tuo, ut facias
illud. That is to say / the word is present / and at hand with the in thy
mouth / and in thy heart / that thou should do it. By these words we se /
that in the greatist sinner that is / is a certain rule / and knolege to live
welby / if he did follow it. So confundyd. S. Paul the gentiles Roma. 1. of
sin / because they knew the i will they did / was condemnyd by the testimony of
there own conscience. For the law of God to do well by / is wroten naturally
in the heart of every man. he that will diligently sarche him self shall sone
find the same / and incase man would be hold his own image boothe in body /
and in soul thowghe there were no law written / nor heauenes over our hedes to
testifye the gaddenys / and justice of God / and the equite of an honest liefe:
mannis conscience would tell him / when he doothe well / and when i will / Roman.
chapit. 2. Farther the judgment / and discurse of reason desyrythe not only to
live justly in this worold / but also to live for ever in eternal felicite /
Without end / and that cummythe by the similitude of God which yet remaynithe
in the soul / after the sin of Adame. Where by we seplainly that those
excusis of ignorance be damnable. when man seythe he could do well if he
folowid the judgment of his own mind and culd not live an i will lieffe. for when
he doythe i will he knowithe that he doothe against the judgment of his own
conscience. So that we se that the law of god / is either vttwardlye / or
inwardly / or boothe / opened unto man. and by gods grace might do the good /
and leave the i will / if it were not of malice / and accustomyd doing of sin.
The which excusythe the mercy / and goddenis of god / and makythe that noman
shall be excusid in the later judgment / how subtillie so ever they now excuse
the matter / and put there i will doings from the^ and lay it upon the
predestination of God / and would excuse it by ignorancie. or say he cannot be
godd / because he is othere wyce destenyd. this stoicall opinion reprehendid
Horat. Epist. 1. Nemo adeo ferus est, ut non mitescere possit,
Si modo culturae patientem commodet aurem.
That is to say. Noman is so cruel / but may wax meke / So that he give a
willing ear to discipline. All thowghe thou can not comme to so far
acknolege in the scripture / as other that be lernyd / by reason thou art
vnlernyd / or else thy vocation will not suffer the / all days of thy lieffe
to be a student / yet may thou know / and ^po^ pain of damnation art bound
to know the articles of thy faith / to know god in christ / and the holy
catholic church by the word of God wrote^. The ten commandments to know
what works thou should do / and what to leave undone. The pater noster
Christ's prayer / which is a bridgment / epitome / or co^pendious collectio^
of all the psalms / and prayers wrote^ in the hole scripture. In the which
thou praist for the remission of sin as well for thy self / affor all other
/ desyrist the grace of the holy ghost to preserve the in vertew / and all
other / yeuyst thanks for the goddenis of god to wards the / and all other.
He that knowithe less the^ this / cannot be sauyd / and he that knowithe no
more the^ this / if he follow his knolege cannot be da^nid. Io. 17. There be too
commune verses that all men in manner knowith / and doutlis worthy / that telly
the us to know christ / thowghe we know nomor^ / is sufficient: Hoc est
nescire, sine Christo plurima scire:
Si Christum benescis, satis est si caerera nescis.
That is to say / to be ignorant / is to know many things without Christ. If
thou know Christ well / it is sufficient thowghe thou beinguorau^t of all other
things. Thus I have said in the ten holy precepts of almighty God /
according unto the scripeure. And where as thou shall find in any word a letter
to mouche (...) to little / or perchance one for an other / or (...) thographie
not obseruyd. The sentence (...) well at all times / and aright poyntyd / (...)
lack of puttyng on of ynke / or slack drawyng of the press / the letters not
plainly expressyd / Remember. I pray the that it is not in manner possible to
prynt in a known tongue a hole work / with out faults. how mouche more
impossibl^ where as the Setters of the prynt / vndrestandithe not one word of
our speech / and wantythe also souche as knowithe the art of true correctyng.
Where as souche faults or other shall happen / thou shall without all
difficulty / and labor / by the lesson / and process of the matter strayghte
way under stand my mind / and meaning / and as need requirit he / add / or
take away a letter from a word / or change the hole word / if one be put for
an other / in an open / and plain sentence / as in the letter H. at the No^bre
xciiij. in the v. verse / thou shall find penitence / for pestilence. Souche
faults cheritale bare with all I pray the / for all thowghe it be not as well
do^ne as I would wyshe / and as every Christian reader would desire: yet is it
as well as I could have it do^ne. take it therefore well ^^ wourthe / and
remember the saing of Hor. li. i. Epi. 1. Est quodda^ prodire tenus, si no^ da
^ultra. Ffare well in our only / and sole Joy / and consolation Christ Jesus.
