MORE NEWS FROM THE PALATINATE, THE SEcond time imprinted, the 5. of June.
SIR, to requite your news out of England with some of ours out of the
Palatinate, which is as much I know desired by you there, as yours is here;
and now especially since the King of Bobemiaes arrival amongst us: since when,
this Country, which before was but the field of war, is now the
slaughterhouse of men: wherein what acts of hostility, and what chances of
war have fallen out, and how the brave and never enough commended Count
Mansfeild has defeated Tilly, and that misfortune on our side of that good
Prince the Marquis of Baden, I leave to you to read in my former letters
written to my other friends, a sight of which you can at any time command; and
therefore omitting them, please you to hear the latter occurrences.

The Archduke Leopoldus who is Landtgraue of Alsatia and Bishop of Strasburgh,
being a man engaged in the quarrel, as being the Emperors brother, one that is
no raw soldier, for he has done much service in the Grisons country, about
that passage of the Valtoline (of which I suppose you have often heard) and
therefore fit to be a General, and especially for that his country lies so
co^moditously to do us a mischief, for he borders upon the Bishop of Spires,
through whose land, and over the Rhine he may in few days march, lead an army
into the Palatinate, which is next to Spires: this Leopoldus, I say, partly as
it were to revenge the disgrace received by Count Mansfield, who this last
Winter harassed his country, even to the taking composition of his chief city
Elsas Saueren or Zabern, and partly animated by the defeat of the Marquis of
Baden; and for that the King of Bohemia and Count Mansfield were busied in
taking in of towns, and of Laudenberg in particular, which stands upon the
Neckar which runs by Heidelberg, by which means Tillies passage over the
Neckaris cut off: so that he perceiving that by this diuerting of the
Palatinate armies, he was not like to be waylaid or intercepted in his march
to Hagenaw, which was not far from him, being only from his own Alsatia into
the Bishop of Spires country, and short of the Palatinate. The reason of his
purpose to besiege Hagenaw being in his friends country, was sure for that
Count Mansfeild this last Winter when he ouer-ran both Alsatia and Spiers, had
taken in this Hagenaw and put a garrison into it, and had left besides some
things of good importance in it: and again, it seems that Leopoldus seeing
the Bishop of Spiers not able to recover the town, he thought it of very great
importance to the advancement of the business in general, which made him
resolve upon a journey in person thither: which if he could have won, then the
two Archdukes had easily joined their forces together, whom this town only
kept asunder. Upon these grounds and for these reasons, he with a fair army of
7 or 8000 foot and 2000 horse, and drawing after him 6 or 7 pieces, marches up
the country, and fairly sets him down before this Hagenaw there, after usual
summons to yield, upon the garrisons refusing to parley, he falls to his battery,
which he plied very hotly, doing all he could to get into it, before it could
be relieved by our party. There were in the town some 4000 foot and 500 horse,
which the provident Count Mansfeild had left there, and these made shift to
hold the town til they could advertise their General of the danger of his
garrison; who upon the first notice, being then about Themersheim in the
Palatinate, came down with the King of Bohemia, and the best part of 20000
men, to remove the siege; which was so timely done, that (the enemy having
gotten some of the town ditches and of their quarter) it was thought the town
could not have held out above 2 days longer. Now Leopoldus having intercepted
the letter of comfort which Count Mansfeild sent to the town, promising to
come to relieve it by such a day and hour; and having by his skouts learned
that Mansfeild with his army followed his messenger, perceiving that he could
not so suddenly carry the town, and fearing a surprise, or to be hemd in with
the Rhine, the town garrison and the Kings army, sent some 9 or 10 hundred
horse and some few foot companies to make some resistance in the way about
Wisenberg, so to stay Mansfeild a little, and with the loss of these forlorn
men to save the rest of his maine army; with which he rose hastily and so
tumultuously, that the town garrison taking notice and advantage of his sudden
rising and disorderly tetrait, sallied forth; and what in the trenches (where
commonly some sick or hurt men that cannot follow, or others that tend upon the
baggage are left behind,) and what in the Rereward which they fell upon, they
had the killing of 500 or 600 of the enemy.

And by this time Count Mansfeild with the King of Bohemia, had dispatched those
poor Companies aforesaid (which lay in their way,) and were at their heels
too: So that the Archduke Leopoldus being so hotly pursued by a greater Army,
and by the Count Mansfeild, who has still had the master fortune of him, was
forced to take the Rhine; over which, with some of those which were nearest to
him, he wasted himself; and it is said he escaped so narrowly, that Count
Mansfeild was within half an hour of taking his Person. One part of his Army
which thought to have passed the Rhine at Drusenheim, about the eighth or ninth
of May, were cut off, and about 2000 Boats, Punts, and Rhine ships were taken;
in which the Mansfeildians themselves passed, and on the other side, got great
booty, which every man had, that got. Leopold thought to rallee together his
Army which passed the Rhine, and to seek to join with Tillye and go into
the Mark grave of Badens Country, or to Fryburgh to seek the enemy: But the
Mansfeildians pursuing them over the Rhine too, he with all speed retired into
his own Alsatia, and Brisgoia, as some of his companies that escaped with the
first, did into Zabern, Dachstein, Moltzheim, and other walled Towns
thereabouts: some six Cornets of horse got into a Wood, neither did Colonel
Obertraut think it safe to set upon them there, but he went into Strasburgh
there by, and only kept the Country about it, and waited for their coming
forth. And there for three days they kept themselves safe enough, which they
could not have done in a plain and open field: For the defendants have this
advantage of the Assaylants in a Wood, That they need not fear either ambush
or surprise; but the Assaylant is rather wary to enter those thickets for
fear of falling himself into an Ambuscado. Then again, against an Army in a
Wood, the enemy can have small use of his horse; and the trees and bushes make
his Pikes mostly unserviceable too. As for shot, they may go a birding if they
please, for any great good they can do, for they shall be sure to hit more
trees then men: whereas the defendants may better use their Arms; for their
body of Pikes may be orderly ranged, and may make a firm stand, and are not
cumbred with carrying and entangling them among the trees, but need no more
but charge them upon the Assaylants; and every tree again, is as good as a
tower for a Musquetier, from behind which he may at pleasure and in safety
almost discharge; and the tree serves him for a Rest too: so that an Army
there, fears nothing but firing the Coppis about their ears, or to be famisht
if they be so round beset, that their horse cannot get out on the back side to
fetch in relief; and this want of victuals was the advantage which Count
Mansfeild had of them: For when the soldiers had eat up their victuals which
they brought with them in their knapsacks, and drunk out all their water out
of their bottels, or (those that had it) their wine out of their Borachoes;
there was no stay for them in a desert succourlesse Forest; so that hunger
which breaks through stone walls, and fears no worse enemy then it self,
made some of them rather out of stomach then courage, to adventure forth; and
sending a Trumpet to Strasburgh to offer their service to that State, came with
their troops within a Musket shot of the Town, and there quietly expected
their answer: The Burghers, though they had no need of horsemen, yet
courteously sent them out bread and wine for themselves, and oats for their
horses: with which, while they made merry, a younger Prince of the house of
Saxony (a man though not in any entertainment, yet friend to the Emperor)
being then in Strasburgh, went out to them, persuading with Colonel Mouder
their chief Commander, to return to Leopoldus service; which the brave
Colonel Obertraut hearing of, sent out of Strasburgh and took the Prince
prisoner, and sent him to Hagenaw, whence we hear, he is to be sent to us to
Manhem: Hereupon the whole six Cornets yielded to Obertraut, and took the
oath to serve the King of Bohemia, and rent Leopoldus Ensigns, and received
the Kings Colors. They gave notice also of six Cornets of horse more, and one
Company of foot which would do likewise: of which we have not yet heard.

While these things went thus with them, another part of Leopoldus Army had
got into Lichtenaw, and fortifide it; these were some few Companies of foot,
with five pieces of Ordnance, which they brought from Hagenaw; but by letters
from some of themselves the 12 of this May, it appears they were so weak,
that they fear the Marquess of Badens coming upon them, who (though he has
received an overthrow and lost his baggage and Canon, which he has not yet
recovered) has now made over his Country to his Son, and has rallyed the
scatterd Regiments of his Army together, and has again taken on those
Companies which he cast before, and sworn them in the name of the King of
Bohemia, so that he is six or 7000 foot, and 1500 or 2000 horse in the field
again, and resolves once more to try his fortune.

And thus you hear what is become of the Archdukes men. One thing I had
forgot, which was this, That when he rose from Hagenaw, he for haste left
behind him one Mortar, and two Wagons laden with Granades 250 Centeryes
(hundred weights) of powder, 150 of match, and some other munition, which he
put into a little village hard by, with a guard of 80 Musketeers, who quickly
yielded what they were not able to keep. It seems the Archduke wanted horse
to draw away his Canon, and was feign to take those out of his Wagons, which
should have carried away his Ammunition, which he had rather leave behind him
then the other: for he thought it would have been a great dishonor to him, to
have lost his Canon; and the King of Bohemia was as well content with the
match, powder, and shot, which he left; for he had more need of that, then of
pieces.

And thus, Sir, have I related the siege of Hagenaw, with what followed after
the raising of it: one part of Leopoldus Army being slain in the way by the
Mansfeildians, coming to relieve the Town; others in their Trenches, by the
town Garrison sallying out; others drowned and slain in passing the Rhine; a
second part got home with their General; a third part is entertained by us;
and a fourth part in a weak Town in fear of the Marckgraue of Baden; The
Archduke himself hardly escaping: his whole Army thus utterly defeated, he
has no power of a while to make head again.

What the King of Bohemia will next do, was not resolved upon the tenth of
this month; only, that he observes which way Tillye and the Spaniards will
stir, that he may (if it please God to strengthen him) be with his other
enemies, as he has been with the Leopoldians. What next happens, you shall
every week (if conueniencie of Messengers serve) be faithfully certified of
God grant you hear no worse news.

About the same time, news was brought us out of the Bishop of Cullens
Country, of the brave exploits of young Brunswicke, whom the Germans for his
courage, vigor, and spirit, call the Dull Hertzog Van Brunswick, that is, the
Mad Duke of Brunswick. This young Imp of Mars, being trained up under the
discipline of that famous old Soldier, the Prince of Orange his kinsman, as
you cannot but have heard, and being brother to the present Duke of Brunswicke,
who having no hope of Issue, this is held to be his heir apparent and
successor, who though he were like to be a Prince of the Empire, could not yet
be discouraged from this enterprise, with that vulgar fear, That if he
declared himself so far against the Emperor, that he would give away his
Dukedom, but has vowed for his Cozens sake the Queen of Bohemia, to spend
the last drop of his blood. And how the Emperor is like to deal with him, you
may perceive by this passage: In that the young Duke, being Bishop of
Halberstadt (a Common thing in Germany for Princes second brothers or sons,
to get those greater Bishoprics) the Emperor sent some Commissioners to
gather up his revenues; Which the King of Denmark (as it is said) hearing of,
sent to them, telling them, that his Cozen before he had engaged himself in
that action, had made over the profits of his Bishopric to him, and if they
did not leave them to his ordinary Officers to receive, he himself would come
and fetch them. But this Duke, notwithstanding these fears both in the present
and future, has kept foul quarter this spring in the Prince Archbishop
Elector of Cullens Country, which both lay in his way, between the
Low Countries whence he came, and the Palatinate, whither he purposed to march;
and also, this Bishop is brother to the Duke of Bauaria, to whom the King of
Bohemia is next heir: for it is generally held, that the Bauarian is like to
leave no issue, and therefore is his brother of Cullen, though a Bishop, yet
kept by dispensation from Rome, out of Orders, that he may marry if need be,
and so to keep the Palatinate of Bauaria from falling to the Palatinate of the
Rhine, which will (and especially in these times) make the Palsgraue too great
a Prince for the Empire to endure. And these are apparent reasons of the
spoiling of the Country, which has been much forraged and harassed by the
Duke of Brunswick, who has enforced the Bishop to forsake his Country, and to
make the very town of Cullen it self to give him Contribution to pay his
Soldiers.

But to come to what is newly and lastly done; it is said that upon this Assembly
of Ambassadors at Bruxels, who consult for a peace in the Empire, and treat
about a Rendition of every Country to its own Prince; that this young Spirit
was sent unto by some, to lay down his Arms while they treated of a peace: his
answer was said to be to this effect; That his Arms were in his hand, and if
they would have him lay them down, let them come and take them out of his
hands: Which it seems Count Henry Vandenberg was sent to do; whom Spinola sent
out with about 17. troop of horse after him: who following him with long
marches, and the Duke going further up the Country, to find a commodious
place to encampe in, that he might not seem to flee, sent word as it is said to
Vandenberg, that he did not flee, but would abide him battle and fight with
him: But it is generally held by good Captains, that he had been then in great
danger, as having the Baron of Anhault, who is the Archbishops General on one
side, and Vandenberg with his old troops on the other side: But that fiery
stratagem (of which I am sure you cannot but hear better then we) of the
Prince Henry of Nassaw, in burning the Country about Brussels, even in the
sight of the Arch-Duchesse and Spinola himself, has delivered him. For
Spinola perceiving this to be done by horsemen, whom he could not oppose or
keep from such another exploit, but by a power of horse, was enforced to send
for his horse back to look to all at home.

Brunswick being thus beyond expectation freed of Vandenberg, with his whole
forces sets upon his other enemy the Baron of Anhalt, whom though he had
sometime before defeated, yet he hoping well to enclose him betwixt himself
and Vandenberg, was bold to make head and appear in the field again; but to
his loss again: for the Duke joining battle with him, overthrew him, and
made himself so much master of the field, that he had leisure both to fortify
three of the best towns thereabouts which he had taken in, and to garrison and
victual them; and also cleared his passage toward the Palatinate, to join
with his Cousen the King of Bohemia, and Count Mansfeild; I suppose the people
of Cullen were not altogether sorry for Anhalts overthrow; for though to the
disadvantage of the cause in general Brunswick had made his way by the sword
through their Country; yet for their particular they could not but be glad when
they heard he was passed the Rhine; for by this means they were freed of a
powerful and chargeable enemy; for it is reported, that he is come out of their
Country with thirty Tun of Dollars: him we expect daily amongst us; and
whether the King and Count Mansfeild will hold it fit to keep him with them,
they thinking they have enough forces together already, to regaine the
Palatinate; or whether they will direct him some other course to fall upon some
other Country, which has aided the Spaniards, and Bauaria in this war;
which being most likely, you may guess as we do. What is done I purpose to
certify you from time to time: For this Summer though it should prove as cold
as the last, is likely to be heat with fire, not from the Sun, but the Canon:
and the Earth (it is feared) is like to be wet with as many showers of blood, as
it was the last year with rain. God grant (if he has appointed it so) that
the right vein may be opened: although even all good Protestants, I hope,
could desire God rather to give us peace then victory.

Now Sir, to acquaint you briefly with the estate of every particular Army
about the Palatinate; The Kings Army is much encouraged by his own personal
and brave resolution, being one still himself in all adventures; so that now
those Libellers, who after the defeat at Prague, sent out a Picture of a
Postillian or a Post ryding up and down, enquiring for the forlorn (that is,
the lost) Palatine, may now find him in the head of his Troops; and might of
late have seen him pursuing his Enemies: so that now the lost Palatine is
found, having been thus long, not so much fled, as given way rather to the
necessity of the times, and not hidden at the Hagh thus long; but all the while
trained up under that famous, great, old, and experienced Soldier, his Uncle
the Prince of Orange, from whom he is now come to a brave Army of Twenty
Thousand foot, and Five Thousand Horse well appointed, well paid, flesht in the
blood of their Enemies, Masters of the field: and which is worth half an Army,
led by that Generous and Victorious Count Mansfield; A man whom all the world
has given for lost, whom only his own virtue, worth and spirit have raised
to this Command and same. So that we all here conceive, that God has reserved
him, and lifted him out of the dust, merely or mostly to show himself to be
the Lord of Hosts, and that it is only in his power to deliver by the
unlikeliest means; so that we hope, that he, who could do thus much out of
nothing, will out of thus much, do any thing: And he is now gone out of the
Palatinate, into Dermstadt, an enemies Country between this and Franckford;
where the Duke of Brunswicke is the 26. of this month of May, to meet with him.
What martial exploits shall next be atcheiued, the next packet shall tell you.
The Marquess of Baden is to follow the King of Bohemia with his Army within
two days.

As for our English Companies, they are thus divided: Noble Captain Borroughes
who so bravely defended Franckendale against the Spaniards, is for his good
service governor of the Town, where he now is with my Lord of Essex, and
Captain Ralph Vanes Companies. Sir Garret Herbert, and our famous Enginer
captain Dexter, are in Heidelbergh. My Lord General Vere himself, with his
own, and six Companies more, are in this strong Town of Manhem, which is
situated upon these two great Rivers the Rhine, and the Neckar, which there
meet as if to make the Town invincible. Colonel Grayes regiment is with Count
Mansfield. Now for our enemies, they are at this point: Gonsales Cordoua the
Spanish General, like an old Fox, keeps close in Oppenheim, which he
fortifies, as if he meant rather to lurk there, then appear in the field, as
it is verily believed he purposes not to do; His Garrison at Vdenheim has
lately surprised two weak Towns, Brussell, and Rottenbergh, through the
negligence of the Governors, but they are of no importance.

As for Tilly, he keeps the field above Heidelbergh, near upon the Neckar,
at Winxfen, where the unfortunate battle was fought with Baden: and there he
fortifies himself expecting succors: he is not made so much account of, for
one of the old Soldiers Spaniards, Italians, and Wallons in Cordovaes
Regiment, are held worth two of his Bavarians, and for all him, Count Mansfield
is gone into Dermstadt. And this is the estate of our Enemies. From other parts
we hear that Bethlem Gabor is almost in a readiness, and altogether in a
resolution to march hitherward, with the Marquess of Iegerensdorff, and the
Count de Turn, so that here we hope shortly to have better conditions offered
us.

And thus Sir, I end a long letter, wherein I have dilated the discourse, by
attempting to give the reasons of each motion, and to describe the persons and
places, to give light to the story, which you shall do well to keep by you,
for it will make you the better to understand whatsoever shall be written of
these Wars.

FINIS.
