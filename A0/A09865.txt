Formula little forms excusandi of excusing absentiae absence apud with (or in

come thou tam so sero late? Nostri our folk (or our people) serius too late
excitaverunt wakened me me somno from sleep. Surrexi I have risen serius too
late praeter besides (or against) voluntatem will. Serius too late experge
factus sum I wakened propter by reason of convivium a banquet caenam a supper
prolatam prolonged in into (or unto) mediam the midst of noctem night

through negligentiam negligence reliqueram I had left librum a book domi at
home, hunc this vt that afferrem I might fetch (or bring,) recurri I can
back domum home ex itinere out of the way (or jorney.) Adjuvi I helped

Scholam School? Ludum the exercise place literarium of (or belonging to)
learning? Cur wherefore non interfuisti have thou not been present hora in the

Johannes John. Praeceptor the master jussit has commanded interrogare to ask
quid what agas you do (or may be a doing) quod that non not intersis you are
present at lectionibus the readings (or lectures.) Petrus Peter, vides thou
see me that I esse am occupatum busily occupied, male habere am ill at ease,
aegrotare am sick. Ideo therefore oro I entreat vt that excuses you excuse me
me absentem absent. Vbi when caepero I shall begin melius habere to be in
better health, (or to find my self better) statim forthwith revertar I will
return ad unto vos you in into scholam the school Discipulus the scholar.
Praeceptor O master curavi I have taken care of quod what mandasti you have
commanded (or given in charge.) Petrus Petes dicit says se that he occupatum
esse is taken up in business male habere is ill at ease male habuisse has been
not well scripsisse has written iteras letters. Decumbit haee lies down in
lecto in bed join (...) (or already) tres three totos whole dies days (he
has now kept his bed three whole days.) Parents the Parents Petri of Peter
dicunt do say ipsum that he esse is profectum journied peregre far from
home. Parents the Parents Iohannis of John dicunt do say nihil that nothing
negotu of business (no business) faisse has been ei to him (or he has had)
ideo therefore rogant they request te you vt that punias you punish caedas
beat virgis with rods ipsum him cum when fuerit reversus he shall return in
scholam into the school. Formulae little forms deferendi of accusing (or
making complaint on) discipulum a scholar ad unto praeceptorem the master.
Chatissime most dear praeceptor master Johannes John exhibet puts mihi to
me negotium business (puts me to trouble.) Est he is molestus troublesome
mihi to me. Non sinit he lets not alone me me, Trudit he trusts me me.
Premit he presses (or squiseth) me me. Johannes John illudit mocketh at mihi
me. Objecit he has laid before mihi me pedem his foot vt that caderem I
night fall. Convellit he pulls off capillos the hairs mihi from me (be
pulls off my hairs.) Non sinit he suffers not me me transire to pass
away (or by.) Interturbat he disturbeth me me scribentem writing ediscentem
learning by heart relegentem reading over (or again) lectionem the lesson.
Occupat he keeps by force (or withholdeth) meum my locum place. Extrudit he
thruu^eth out me me ex from meo my loco place. Percussit he has smitten me
me baculo with a staff atramentario with an Inckhorne, pugno with the fist.
Impegit he has dashed colaphum a buffet mihi on me, (he has given me a blow
on the cheek.) conje cit he has hurled (or cast forth) in on (or against) me

lapide with a stone. Vulneravit he has wounded me me gladio with a sword

called) me me ignominioso by a nicke (or reproachful) nomine name. Comminatus

not wed (or yielded) se himself obedientem obedient parentibus to his parents.
Excusatio the excuse. Res the matter non not habet has se it self ita so (the
matter is not so) Johannes John mentitur lies. Petrus Peter odit hates me me.
Male euilly vult he wills mihi to me (he bears me ill will,) ideo therefore
comminiscitur he faigneth haec these things in against me me. Non laesi I have
not hurt cum him. Non attigi I have not touched ipsum him digito with my
finger. Feci I have done it non volens not willing. F^ci I have done it per
through imprudentiam not thinking thereof (unawares.) Non not ego I in against
illum him sed but ille he in against me me deliquit has done an ^ffence (or
committed a fault of omission.) Paenitet it irketh me me facti of the fact.
Paenitet it repents me me illorum of those things quae which deliqui I have
committed in against Petrum Peter. Deinceps henceforth faciam I will do nihil
nothing tale such (no such thing) non ^uit there has not been mihi to me
otium leisure scribendi to write discendi to learn haec these things. Propter

were plures more tales such qui which imitarentur would imitate tuam thy
diligentiam diligence in in discendis learning literis letters (or literature)
et and regendis in ruling (or ordering) moribus their manners. Vero and ego I
non not solum only libenter willingly do give tibi to thee v^niam leave abeundi
to depart (or go) in into patriam thy country, sed but etiam also oro do
pray Deum God vt that deinceps afterward (or now hereafter) regat he rule et

tuae thy res matters habent have se themselue, (how go thine affairs.) Non
not fatis enough feliciter happily. Habent they have pessime very bad (they go
very ill.) Fort assis peradventure interpello I disturb te thee occupatum

greatly vacuum (...)ant (or at leisure.) Enim for jam already taedium a
weariness otii of leisure ceperat had taked me me (had begun to take hold on
me) et and desiderabam I did desire congerronem a merry companion. Fortassis
peradventure interturbo I interrupt impedio I hinder tua thy negotia
businesses. Imo nay rather discutis thou driuest away taedium the
wearisomenesse otii of idleness. Da grant veniam pardon si if interpellarim I
have interrupted te thee parum a little in tempore in a seasonable time. Imo
nay rather advenis thou come in in ipso the very tempore seasonable time
(thou come even at the very point and chief season.) Tuus thy adventus
coming est is vehementer greatly gratus acceptable mihi to me. Fortassis
peradventure aliquid some seriae serious re^ matter agitur is handled inter
between vos you, cui whereto ego I nolim am unwilling (or would not) esse be
impedimento an hinderance. Imo yea but locuti sumus we have spoken de te
concerning thee. Credo I believe it facile easily, nam for mire wonderfully
auris my ear tinniebat did tingle (or ring or burn) mihi to me venienti
coming huc hither. V^ra whether? Sinistra the left. Vnde from whence conjicio
I conjecture nihil that nothing magnifice with much commendation fuisse dictum
was said ^e me concerning me. Imo nay rather nihil non nothing not (every
thing) honorificum spoken to thy honor. Sed but quid what bonae good rei
matter (or thing) est is it? Aiun^ they say te that thou factum esse art become
venatorem an hunter. Imo yea. jam now intra within meos my casses nets (or
hayes) est there is praeda the prey quam which venabar I hunted. Quaenam what
is it? Lepida a pretty puella damsel quam whom sum I am ducturus to marry (or
take unto wife) perendie the next day after to morro^. Ideo therefore oro I
entreat (...)os you vt that tunc then cohonestetis you grace (or set forth)
nuptias the Wedding vestra by your praesentia presence. Quaenam who est is
Sponfa the Bride? Dorothea Dorothie filia the daughter nostri of our
concionatoris Preacher. De for (or concerning) hac her merito with good cause
gratulamur we rejoice in the behalf of tibi thee. Nam for non not solum only
est she is pulchra fair (or beautiful) sed but etiam also been well educata
brought up et both ad to manendum abide domi at home ac and curanda to regard
(or take care of) domestica household (or home) negotia businesses, optime
maruellously well instituta trained up (or instructed.) confabulatio a
communing domestica pertainingto house (or household) matters. Heus ho^ puer boy
prodit comes there forth nemo no body huc hither? Hic this man opinor I
think effringet will break open (or to pieces) fores the door. Est it is
veri^^imile very like esse that he is aliquem sonte samiliarem familiar. O
amice O friend mi my Petie Peter quid what adfers do thou bring? Meipsum
mine own self. Tu thou certe truly attulisti have brought huc hither rem a
thing haud not magni of a great pretii price. Atqui yea but constiti I cost meo
patri my father magno a great price. Credo I believe eum that he fecisse has
made (or bestowed) majores greater sumptus costs (or charges) in upon te thee
quam than pro according to dignitate thy worthiness (or desert.) Sed but nc
whether est is Johannes John domi at home? Non scio I know not certo certainly
(or assuredly.) sed but abi go visum to see. Vel or abi go tu thou potius
rather interogatum to ask (or enquire) an whether sit he be domi at home. An
whether velit he will jam now at length (or ere it be long) esse be domi at
home? Heus hoe Petre Peter number whether, es art thou domi at home? Non sum I am
not. Impudens thou shameless one non ego audio do not I hear te thee
loquentem speaking. Imo nay rather tu thou impudentior art more shameless.
Enim for ^uper lately credidi I beleeuedtuae thy ancillae maid te that thou non
esse was not domi at home, et and tu thou non credis beleeuest not mihi ipsi
me my self. Dicis thou say aequum right (thou speak reason.) Nam for
refers thou rendrest par like pari for like Sed but videris thou seem mihi
to me agere to lead (or live) vitam the life cochleae of a Snaile. Quid why
ita so? Quia because perpetuo always seeds thou sit domi at home nec and
not prorepis come forth vsquam to any place. Est there is matter quod which
agam I may do domi at home, feris abroad est there is mihi to me nihil
nothing negotii of business (no business.) Et and si if esset there were quid
any tamen yet notwithstanding haec this aura wind (or ayrs) cohibuisset would
had kept (or restrained) me me a from publico abroad aliquot certain dies
days. Sed but nunc now coelum the firmament (or air) est is serenum fair (or
clear) et and invitat inuiteth (or allureth) ad to deambulandum walk abroad.
Si if lubet it likes prodeambulare to walk forth, non recuso I refuse not.
Assides thou sit at libris thy books nimium overmuch. Maceras thou wearest
out te thy self immodico with immoderate (or unmeasurable) studio study. Malo
I have rather (or liefer) marcescere to be consumed (or become faint.) studio
with study quam than amore with love. Ecquid whether haec this deambulatio
walking abroad fuit has been voluptati unto (or for) pleasure? Quidem truly
ego I delectatus sum ea hane been delighted therewith (or therein) vehementer
very greatly. A lius another dialogus dialogue. Opto I wish tibi to thee multam
much felicitatem happiness. Et and ego I opto wish conduplicatum double
quicquid whatsouer optas thou wishest mihi to me. Quid what agis do thou?
Confabulor I commune. Quid what? Confabulare do thou commune solus alone?
Certe truly confabulor I talk cum with lepidissimo a most pleasant congetroni
merry companion. Quo with whom? Divo with saint Paulo Paul. Cicerone with
Cicero. Quidem indeed facis thou do istud that saepe oftentimes. Sed but
varietas variety est is grata pleasant (or acceptable.) Tu thou^ perpetuo
continually tu thou noctes nights et and dies days incumbis applyest (or
bendest earnestly) literis to learning. Nihil nothing suave is sweet (or
pleasant) quod the which perpetuum is continual without ceasing. Facis thou
do tuo after thy more fashion (or custom.) Rides thou laughest at me me vt
as soles thou art wont. Ipsi the very libri books obducti covered ou^r pulv
ere with dust testantur do testify (or witness) meam my diligentiam
diligence in in studiis studies de concerning mea my diligentia diligence in
studiis in studies. Loquor I speak seri o earnestly ex from animo my heart.
Formulae forms mandandi of giving in charge (or bidding) ac and pollicendi of

cordi unto heart (that thou have a care of this thing.) Rogo I request etiam

negotium business sit be tibi to thee curae a core. Si if amas thou love me
me efficias bring to pass (or to effect) hoc this thing fideliter faithfully
et and diligenter diligently. Ego I reddam will make (or procure) hoc this
thing effectum effected tibi for thee, et and quidem indeed propediem shortly

sed but praestab^ I will perform(...) in the deed quicquid whatsoever est is

will exanimo from the heart (or affection.) Cur why non visis do thou not
visit (or go to see?) Propter by reason of quam what causam cause non invisis
do thou not come to see nos us tamdiu so long a while? Quid what accidit
has happened quod that tam so longo long tempore time non accesseris thou have
not come ad unto nos us tam so longo long tempore a time? Quid what obstitit
has let (or been in the way) quo whereby minus the less (that not) jam
now diu a great while (or long time) veneris thou have come ad nos unto us? Non
licuit it has not been lawful; (or I might not, or could not.) Non licuit I
was not free per by reason of occupationes necessary businesses. Otium leisure
non fuit has not been mihi to me (I have had no leisure.) Equidem truly
volui I have been willing sed but facultas ability (or leave) non data est
has not been given (or granted) mihi to me. Negotia the businesses quibus
with which eram I was implicatus encumbered non patiebantur suffered not vt that
salutarem I might salute te thee (that I might do my duty to you.) Accipio I
accept tuam thy excusationem excuse, sed but hac with this lege condition ne
that not vtaris thou use it saepius oftener times. Tua thy excusatio excuse
est is justior juster quam than vellem I would siquidem in as much as morbus a
disease fuit was (or has been) in causa for excuse (has been the cause or
ocsion.) accipio I receive (or take) tuam thy excusationem excuse hac lege upon
this condition si if quod that which est is neglectum neglected compenses thou
make amends for crebris with often alloquiis communications. Successus the
success (or event.) Res the matter successit has prospered (or had success)
melius better opinione than supposell (then you think.) Impetravi I have
obtained by request plus more quam than ausus fuissem I might had dared optare
to wish. Omnis all res the matter cecidit has chanced ex according to
sententia my mind (as I would wish or have it.) Et both habeo I give et and
habiturus sum I will give maximam very great gratiam thanks tibi to you quoad
as long as vivam I live. Possum I can vi^ scarce agere give gratias thanks
pares meet (or equal) pro for isto that tuo thy beneficio good turn, refer

(...) gratiam thanks, Ex out of (or among) omnibus all beneficiis benefits
quae which plurima being very many tu thou contulisti have bestowed in on me
me hoc this est is long far gratissimum the most acceptable. Responsio the
answer, Nostra our necessitudo nigh friendship est is major greater quam than
vt that vel either tu thou mihi to me vel or ego I tibi to thee debeam naught
agere to give gratias thanks pro for vllo any beneficio good turn. Qui he
which been well meretur deserves de of amico a friend non dat does not give
beneficium a kindness (or good turn) sed but foenerat lends out to vsutie.
Si if ex animo from the heart probas thou allowest (or approuest) meum my
officium duty (or service) in unto (or toward) te thee, fac do vtare that

of us esse to be commodissimum the most commodious (or convenient) (or when it
shall seem to be most convenient for both of us.) Sed but ego I detineo do
detain te thee fortassis peradventure iturum about to go alio to another
place. Imo yea rather ego I (do detain) te thee opino^ I suppose. Sed but
cras tomorrow confabulabimur we will talk together latius more amply. Crastino
on to morrowes die day nugabimur we will talk slightly of (or tri^^le about)
plura more things. Interim in the mean while cura have a care vt that valeas
thou be in good health. Formula a form gratulandi of being glad in behalf de
of reditu a return. Matthaeus Mat^hew et and Lucas Luke. Gratulor I rejoice in
the behalf of tibi thee reverso returned in patriam into thy country de of
reditu thy return in patriam into thy country. L. Et and ego I tibi for thee
superstiti suruiuing (or alive) Matthaee O Matthew. M. rediisti thou have
returned nobis to us obesior grosser (or fatter) et and procerior taller solito
than wont (than thou was wont.) Abiisti thou departedst (or wentest) ^ine
without barba beard imberbis beardlesse: rediisti thou have returned barbatus
bearded. Habens having prolixam a long barbam bears. Praeditus endued (or
adorned) pulchra with a fair barba beard. L. At but quidem indeed mallem I
should leiser redire to return prudentior wiser et and doctior learneder. M.
Gratulamur we rejoice in the behalf of et both tibi thee et and nobis our
selves, quod because sis thou art restitutus restored nobis to us vivus living
et and valens in good health. L. Ego I vicissim for my part likewise laetor am
glad quod because incolumis I safe and sound offenderim have found vos ye
incolumes safe and sound. Quod for that repererim I have found te thee salvum
safe (or in good health) gaudeo I am glad vehementer exceeding greatly. M. Quid
what vult means sibi to it self ille that pallor palenesse? (What means
that pale color?) Quid what macies the leanness? Quid what rugae the
wrinckles in front in the forehead? L. Qualis such as (of what sort) fortuna
the fortune (even as ones fortune is) talis such est is et also habitus the
habit corporis of the body. Nunquid whether any thing agitur is done (or gone)
male badly tecum with thee? Nunquid whether aliquid any acerbi grievous thing
(or adversity) accidit has chanced tibi to thee? L. Etsi although fere almost
nullo in no tempore time fortuna fortune favit has favored mihi me, tamen
yet notwithstanding nunquam never adversata est it has crossed (or been
against) mihi me magis more quam than nunc now. M. Doleo I c^ndol^ (or am
sorry for) tuam thy vicem case (or misfortune.) Tua thy calamitas calamity
dolet grieueth (or is w^full) mihi to me. Sed but quid what est is istud that
mali evil? L. Feci I have made naufragium shipwreck vniversae of all (of
every whit of my) pecuniae money. M. Vbinam where charissime most dearly
beloved one? L. Navigaturus sailing (or about to sail) in in Baltico the
Balticke mari sea ex out of Dania Denmark in into Germaniam Germany. M. Igitur
then non est there is not dubium doubt quin but oraveris thou prayedst (or
could have prayed) diligenter diligently. L. Nunquam never diligentius more
diligently. M. Igitur then fateris thou confessest it esse to be verum true
(that that is true) quod which dicitur is said; qui he that nescit knows not
orare to pray discat let him learn navigare to sail. L. Fateor I confess
(it,) nam for expertus sum I have experienced (or proved it) ipsa in the very
re deed. M. Habet it has (or goes) been well, quod that ipse thou thy self
enatasti have swimmed out (or escaped) nobis to us vivus alive. Est it is
melius better facere to suffer Iacturam loss pecuniae of money quam than vitae
of life. Igitur therefore vides thou see doctrinam that learning et and
virtutem that virtue esse are tutissimas most safe divitias riches quae which
nec neither possunt can eripi be taken away nec nor gravant d^t load (or
burden) circumferentem the bearer (he that always carries the same about
him.) Tu thou quidem indeed Philosopharis philosophisest (studiest philosophy
or speak Philosopher like) pulchre ioylily well, sed but interim in the
mean while ego I angor am vexed dolor with the grief. Salutare to salute per
alium another. Saluta salute thou meos my parents parents (do my
commendations to my parents.) Sakita salute consulem the Consul pastorem the
Pastor socrum my wives mother affinem my cousin (by marriage) meo in my nomine
name vel or meis with my verbis words. Quo whither vadis go thou Nicholae O
Nicholas? Recta straight forth in patriam into the country. Resist stop (or
stay) paulisper a little while, est there is business quod the which mandem I
may commit tibi to you. (There is somewhat which I should give in charge to
you.) Sed but sarcina a pack non convenit squareth (or suiteth not) pediti to
a footman (it is not fit for a footman to bear a trusse or fardle.) Non
imponam I will not put upon tibi thee magnum a great onus burden. Autem but
quid what rei thing est is it? Vt that amanter lovingly salutes you salute meis
verbis with my words omnes all praeceptores the masters (or teachers,) et and
meos my familiares familiars (or friends or acquaintance) in in rostochiana
Rostock Academia University. Si if imponis you impose (or la^e on me) nihil
aliud sarcinae no other packs praeter besides salutationes salutations, facile
easily perferam I shall bear it through (to the ways end.) Autem and (or but)
ego I, ne least that facias thou may (or should do) istud this thing
gratis without reward (for nothing) precor do pray vt that Christu^ Christ sit
be tibi to thee comes a companion itineris of the journey. Quod that which
precaris thou prayest for Deus God faxit grant. Enim for si if habuero I shall
have Christum Christ comitem a companion itineris of the way (or journey) scio
I know me that I satis enough esse am munitum fenced (or fortified) contra
against omnia all pericula dangers. Formulae forms interrogandi of asking de
concerning valetudine health. Georgius George. Lucas Luke, G. Ne whether vales
are you in good health? L. Contemplare behold diligently vultum my countenance.
G. Quin why, not magis rather jubes do thou bid me (to look diligently
upon) lotium thy water (or urine?) An whether putas think thou, me that I
(am) medicum a physician? Non rogo I ask not an whether valeas thou be in good
health, nam for ipsa thy very facies face loquitur speaks (or tells) te
that thou valere art in health belle well (or goodly,) sed but quomodo how
placeas can thou please (or delight) tibi thy self? L. Corpus my body quidem
indeed habet has belle well (is well) sed but est it is animo to my mind male
ill (my mind is not well) G. At but non valet he is not in good health, qui
which laborat is ill at ease ista in that part part. L. Sic so meae my res
matters habeut have (go or are,) corpus my body valet is well, sed but crumena
my purse aegrotat is sick G. Matter thy mother medebitur will cure isti this
morbo disease facile easily. Vt how valuisti have thou done (been in health)
hueusque hitherto? L. Vary after a diverse manner, vti as res the things (or
matters) mortalium of mortal men sunt are. G. Fuistine whether have thou been
semper always prospera of (or in) prosperous valetudine health? Prosperrima of
most prosperous, gratia thanks Deo to God. Ego I beneficio through the favor
(or bountifulness) Dei of God perpetuo continually valui have been in health
bellissime most goodly (or pleasantly.) hacteous hitherto f^i I have been bona
in good valetudine health. G. Deus God faxit grant vt that istud this (that)
thing (or benefit) sit be perpetuum continual et and proprium thine own.
Audio I hear istud that thing laetus joyful, gratulor I rejoice in the
behalf of tibi thee. Gratias thanks (be) Deo to God. Habeo I have (or yield)
gratiam thanks Deo to God, ago I give Deo to God gratias thanks maximas very
great quantas as (how great as) possum I can. Sed but fuit has there been
tibi to thee interim in the mean while nihil nothing molestiae of trouble (no
disquiet or tediousness?) L. Nihil nothing (or none) nisi except quod that non
licuit it was not lawful (I might not) frui enjoy uestra your consuetudine
acquaintance (or company.) Male valere to be ill (or infirm.) G. Ne whether
vales art thou in health recte well (or rightly?) A. Quidem indeed vellem I
would Non valeo I am not in health per omnia in all things (parts) v^cumque
howsoever valeo I am strong. Non been valeo I am not in good health corpose in
body admodum very much vt as soleo I am wont. Valeo I am in health vt as visum
est it has seemed good Deo to God. Valeo I am in state secus otherwise quam
than vellem I would. vt as solent they are wont, quibus to whom res matter,
(business or dealing) cum medicis with physicians est is, G. Deus God avertat
turn (it) away (forefend,) narras thou tellest rem a matter peracerbam very
sour (or unpleasant) mihi to me. Oportet it behooves (that) sis thou be bono
animo of a good courage. Oportet it behooves (that) praestes thou declarest te
thy self virum a man. Esto be thou forti of a strong infractoque and not
discouraged animo mind (or spirit) contra against morbum the disease. Bonus
animus a good courage multum much juvat helps in mala re in a bad matter. Quo
morbo with what disease teneris art thou halden? Quis morbus what disease tenet
holds te thee? Quid morbi what disease habes have thou? Quo morbo of what
disease laboras art thou sick? (...). Nescio I know not, et and ideo therefore
laboro I am sick periculosius the more dangerously. G. Dicis thou say verum
true. Dicis thou say recte rightly. Enim for primus gradus the first degree
ad sanitatem unto health est is nouisse to know morbum the disease. Ne whether
consuluisti have thou asked counsel of nullum medicum no physician? L. Equidem
truly multos many. G. Quid what respondent do they answer? L. Alius one negat
says no, alius another censet deemeth deliberandum that aduisement must be
taken. In ho^ in this omnes all consentiunt do agree me that I esse am miserum
miserable. G. Quantum temporis how much time est is it, quod that ho^ malum
this evil corripuit has taken (or caught) to thee? Quampridem how long habet
holds te thee hic morbus this disease: L. Octo dies eight days. Iam now est
it is ferme almost integer mensis a whole month. Male habeo I have been ill
tres three, quatuor four, aut or quinque integros menses ^^ue whole months.
labor I am (or have been) sick jam now decimum mensem the tenth month.
Aegroto I am (or have been) sick jam already integrum an^^m a whole year. G.
Genseo I think good adnitendum that greatly it must be endeavored ne that not
morbus the disease fiat become familiaris familiar. Number whether est is it
hydrops a dropsy? I. Negant they say no. g. Number whether dysenteria the bloody
flixe? I. Non arbitror I suppose not. g. Number whether febris a fever? I. Credo
esse I believe that it is. g. Qualisnam of what sort (or manner) est is febris
the feaner? Continuance whether continual, an or quotidiana quotidian (that
happens every day) an or tertiana tertian (that happens every third day) an
or quartana quartaine (that happens on every fourth day?) I. Opinor I suppose
esse it to be novam speciem a new kind febris of fever, vt as nunc now a
days subinde ever now and then novi morbi new diseases exoriuntur do arise
out (or spring forth) incogniti unknown antehac heretofore. g. At but truly
erat there was plus above (or more than) satis enough veterum of old ones. l.
Ita so visum est it has seemed good Deo to God punienti punishing nova peccata
new sins novis morbis with new diseases. g. Quoto die on what day recurrit
comes again dolor the pain? l. Quoto die on what day narras say thou?
Imo yea quotidie daily, saepius oftener quam than Euripus (an arm of the sea
that ebbeth and flows seven times in a day.) g. O malum O evil abominandum
to be abhorred! Vnde from whence contraxisti have thou gotten morbum the
disease? Vnde from whence suspicaris do thou suspect (or suppose) hoc mali
that this evil esse collectum has been taken (or gathered?) l. Ex inedia out
of hunger (or lack of meat and drink.) g. At but non soles thou art not wont
vsque adeo so much esse to be superstitiosus superstitious, vt that maceras te
thou spendest (or consumest thy self) jejunio with fasting. l. Non erat it was
not religio religion, sed but inopia poverty. Enim for cibus meat non dabatur
was not given. Arbitror I judge natum that it was bred e frig ore out of cold:
cruditas the rawnesse stomachi of the stomach contracta est was contracted e
crudis malis from raw apples. g. Vide see (or take heed) ne least that
concillaris thou have procured hoc mali this evil tibi to thy self ex out of
immodico unmeasurable aut or intempestivo unseasonable studio study, aut either
ex largiore potatione out of more abundant drinking (more than custom was, or
more than enough) aut or ex ebrietate out of drunkenness. Sed but cur
wherefore non accersis go not thou to call (or fetch) medicum the Phistian?
l. Timeo I fear ne least that augeat he may increase morbum the disease citius
sooner quam than curet may cure (it.) Metuo I fear ac least that det he may
give venenum poison pro in steed of remedio a remedy. g. Igitur therefore est
he is diligendus to be beloved, cui whom fidas thou may trust tu^o safely.
l. Si if moriendum est I must die, malo I have rather mori to die semel once,
quam than excarnificatus be rended in pieces (or tormented) tot pharmacis with
so many medicines. g. Igitur then fac do, vt that ipse thou sis may be
Medicus a Physitiam tibi to thy self. Si if diffidis thou distrustest homini a
man Medico being a Physician, precor I pray vt that Deus God sit may be tibi to
thee vice in steed Med^ci of a Physician. Sunt there are they qui which induti
clad vest with a garment Monachi of a Monk convaluerunt have recovered
health. l. Idem the same thing fortasse peradventure evenisset would had
happened, si if fuissent they had been recti covered pelle with the skin
Leonis of a Lion. Verum but ista these things nihil nothing conducunt are
profitable diffidenti to one distrusting. g. Igitur then fide trust vt that
reviviscas thou may come to thine old state again (or recover.) Alij some
sunt are levati eased morbo of a disease, votis vows (or promises) nuncupatis
made solemnly (with formal words) alicui to some one divorum of the Saints. l.
At but ego I non paciscor do not make ^ouenant cum diuis with the saints. g.
Proinde therefore pete tu craus thou beneficium the benefit sanitatis of health
a Christo from Christ cui whom fi dis thou trustest. l. At ego but I nescio
know not an whether sit it be beneficium a benefit. g. An non est whether is it
not beneficium a benefit liberari to be freed morbo from a disease? Nonnunquam
sometimes est it is felicius more happy mori to die. Ego autem but I peto do
crave nihil nothing a Christo of Christ, nisi except quod which sit is (or may
be) optimum best. g. Tu quidem thou indeed philosopharis do philosophize (or
philosophically treat) pie godlily. Enim for cum when petimus we ask (or
crave) a Deo of God bona good things necessaria necessary ad hanc vitam for
this life, semper always addendum est we must add, Domine O Lord si tu vis if
thou will. Autem but spiritualia spiritual et and aeterna eternal bona good
things sunt are petenda to be asked a Deo of God sine without vlla any
condition condition. Sed but vale farewell mi Luca my Luke. l. Charissime
Georgi O most dear George vale et tu farewell thou also in crastinum till to
morrow. Alius dialogus another dialogue. g. Fuitne whether has been hoc iter
this journey faustum lucky et commodum and commodious tibi to thee? l. Sic
satis so enough (indifferently) nisi quod saving that nihil nothing vsquam in
any place est tutum is safe a latronibus from robbers. g. Advenis come thou
pedes a footman an eques or a horseman? I. Partim partly itinere by a going
pedestri ou foot, partim partly Vehiculo by Wagon, partim partly equo on
horse, partim partly navigio by sailing (or shipping.) g. Quo in statu in what
state sunt are res Belgicae matters of Belgica (or of the low Countries.) l.
Sane truly turbul ento in a turbulent (or full of troubles.) Sunt there are
magnae minae great threats bellorum of wars. g. Sed but omittamus let us omit
haec these matters. Enim for nihil nothing is nobis to us (we have nothing to
do) cum mart with war. Quomodo how habent have (or go) tuae res thine own
matters? l. Been well, pulchre goodlily, optime very well. g. Nonne whether not
agitur is it done (or fallen forth) been well tecum with thee? l. Optime very
well, felicissime most happily. g. Nonne whether not vteris do thou take
profit of prospero statu the prosperous estate fortunae of fortune? l. Imo nay
rather maxim adverso the greatly unfortunate. Res the matter non potest esse
cannot be in pejori statu in a worser state. g. Non cepisti have thou not
taken, quod captabas that which thou did go about to take? Non contigit
praeda has not the prey happened, quam venabaris which thou did hunt? l.
Venabor equidem I did hunt indeed, sed irata Diana but Diana being angry. g.
Est is there nihil spei no hope reliquum remaining? l. Permultum spei very much
hope, sed but nihil rei no thing (or matter.) g. Consul ostendit nihil spei
does the Consul show no hope (put in no hope?) l. Tota plaustra all the whole
(or every whit of) the Waines (or Chariets,) totas naves every whit of the
ships; sed nihil but nothing praeterea besides. g. Misit nihil adhuc has he
sent nothing as yet? l. Promisit quidem largiter indeed he has promised
largely, sed but misit he has sent ne obolum quidem not an half penny
indeed. Promittit quidem he promises indeed multa many things verbis with
words, sed but praestat he performs nihil nothing re in the deed. g. Ergo
therefore animus the mind est is alendus to be fed spe with hope. l. Sed but
venture the belly non saginatur is not fatted hac herewith. g. Autem but ideo
for that cause eras thou was expeditior the morelight (or readier) ad iter for
the journey, quod because esset there was nihil oneris no burden in zona in
purse. l. Fateor I confess, atque etiam and also tutior the safer. Enim for
sunt there are nulla arma no weapons certiora suerer adversus latrones against
robbers by the high way. Sed ego malim but I can be more williug of et both
onus the burden et and periculum the danger. g. Nihilne whether nothing
ademptum est has been taken away tibi from thee in via in the way? l. Mihine
what from me? Quaeso I pray quid cripias what caust thou take away nudo from a
naked one? Erat there was alijs to others citius sooner (more likely) periculum
danger a me by (or from) me. Licuit it was lawful mihi for me vacuo viatori an
empty traveler (I an empty traveler might) per totum iter through the whole
journey (all the way along) canere to fing et and osurire to hunger. g. Quo
autem but whither nunc abis departest thou now? l. Recta strait, way domum
home solutaturus to salute vxorem wife et and parents parents non visos not
seen jam diu a great while. g. Precor I pray vt that illie there offendas you
may find omnia all things laeta pleasant (or luckie.) l. Vtinam would that
Deus God velit be willing ita so. Extitit has there been (or happened) nihil
novi no news nostrae domi at our house interim in the mean time? g. Nihil
none (or nothing) nisi unless quod that reperies thou shall find familiam the
family auctam increased, nam for tua gallina thy Hen peperit has laid tibi for
thee pulchrum ovum a fair (or goodly) egg. l. Nuncias thou show tidings
been well. Pro hoc nuncio for this news do I give tibi to thee munus a gift
(or present) videlicet to wit, novum Testamentum the new Testament eleganter
finely excustim imprinted Lutetiae at Paris recens lately. g. Itame Deus amet
so God love (help) me, pulchrum evangelium it is a fair Gospel. Hoc munus
this gift est is long gratissimum far most acceptable mihi to me. Dispiciam
I will consider in mind (or look about diligently) vnde by what means possim
I may be able pensare to recompense hoc donum this gift. l. Puta think te that
thee pensasse have recompensed abunde abundantly (or enough) si i. boni
consulueris thou will take in good worth. Alius another. g. Ne whether adfers
bring thou nihil nothing novarum rerum of new matters ex Patria from one
Country? Portas bear (or bring thou) nihil novi no news a nostris from
ours? Quaenam nova what new things nuncias tellest thou? l. Permulta nova very
many new matters at nihil very but nothing true. Adfero I bring tantum
mendaciorum so great lies, quantum as vix scarce vna navis one ship vehat can
carry. g. Igitur then exonera te unburden thy self quamprimum as soon as can
be possiblely, ne least that succumbas thou fall under tanto oneri so great a
burden. l. nihil habeo I have nothing praeter ea besides those things. quae
which jactantur are spoken of in Tonstrinis in Barbers shops, in vehiculis in
wagens, et in navibus and in ships. g. Quid what, no whether est is nostra
patria out country immunis free a pestilentia from the pestilence? l. Non
omnino not altogether, sed but non est it is not perpetua continual (without
intermission:) aliquando sometimes remittit it slacketh sese it self, deinde
afterward recrudescit it waxes grievous again. g. Nonne erat was there not
satis malorum enough of evils, vbi when bellum war grassatur assaileth (or
comes on with violent rage?) l. Erat quidem there was indeed, nisi unless
aliter otherwise visum est it had seemed good Deo to God. g. Oportet there must
needs esse be caritatem a scarsity annonae of victual istic there. l. Est
there is inopia a scarsity omnium rerum. of all things illic there praeterquam
except sceleratorum militum of mischievous soldiers. g. Vbi where milites
soldiers dominantur do bearesway, ibi there parcunt they spare nec neither
sacris templis the sacred temples nec nor ipsis Musis the Muses themselves. l.
Recte igitur rightly therefore et sapienter and wisely Xenophon inquit Xenophon
says: pax peace videtur seems hominibus to men esse to be magnum bonum a
great good, bellum vero but war magnum malum a great evil. Sed but non
morabor te I will not cause thee to tarry diutius any longer. Alias at another
time colloquemur we will confer pluribus with more words, cum when erit it
shall be commodum commodious vtrique for both. Nunc nom quaedam negotia
certain businesses vocant me call me alio to another place. Alius dialogus
another dialogue. g. Audio I hear te that thou nuper lately revisisse
returnedt^ to see Patriam thy Country l. Revisi I went again to see. Enim for
non videram I had not seen meos parents my parents diu a good while. Non
poteram Im as not able diutius far any longer to abide desiderium the lack
(or absence) Patriae of Country et amicorum and of friends. g. Fecisti pie
thou have done godlily, humanus es thou art humane (or friendly) qui which
cogitas think on ista these things. Omnes enim for all we ducimur are led
quodam admirabili amore with a certain wonderful love ejus regionis of that
region, quae which aluit has nourished (or bred) et edidit and has brought
forth nos us. Sed dic quaeso but tell I pray quonam in loco in what state illic
there offendisti foundest thou omnia all things? l. Vniversa universal things
nova new: omnia all things mutata changed. Videbar mihi I seemed to my self
(me thought) venire to come in alium mundum into another world. Vixdum abfueram
I had scarcely been absent decennium the space of ten years, mirabar I
wondered at omnia all things non secus no otherwise, quam than Epimenides
princeps somniat orum Epimenides the chief of dreamers, vix scarce tandem when
all came to all expergefactus wakened out of sleep. g. Quaenam est ista fabula
what is that tale? l. Dicam quidem I will tell it indeed, si vacat if there be
leisure audire to hear. g. Nihil nothing fuerit shall be jucundius more
pleasant (or acceptable.) l. Igitur then jube command sellam that a stool cum
pulvino with a cushion poni be set mihi for me. g. Recte admones thou do
well put in mind, nam for sedens sitting mentieris thou will lie commodius the
more handsomely. l. Historici the historians fabulantur do fable de Epimenide
concerning Epimenides quodam one (or a certain man) Cretensi of Crete, qui
which gratia for the cause deambulandi of walking abroad folus alone egressus
vrbem passed forth of (or passed beyond) the City, cum when as subita vi
through a sudden violence pluviae of rain: compellente constraining
ingressus having entered in quandam speluncam into a certain Cave obdormisset
had fallen fast a sleep, continuarit he continued somuum the sleep
quadraginta septem perpetuos annos forty seven whole years. g. Sed been actum
est but it was well brought to pass cum Epimenide with Epimentdes qui which
tandem at the last redijt returned ad se unto himself. Multi docti many
learned men nunquam expergiscuntur never awake a suis somnijs from their
dreams. Sed facis but thou do vt est dignum as is beseeming Poeta a Peet.
Perge igitur go forward then mentiri to lie. l. Epimenides igitur Epimenides
then solutus somno loosed from sleep (broad awaked) prodit comes forth
esspelurica out of the Cave, circumspicit looks round about, videt omnia
mutata sees all things changed, Sylvas Woods, ripas banks, slumina rivers,
arbores trees, agros fields, breviter briefly, nihil nothing non novum not new
(every thing new.) Accedit he comes ad Vrbem unto the City, percontatur he
asks questions, manet he abides illic there aliquandiu a certain while,
neque neither novit knew quenquam any man, neque nor agnitus est was known (or
acknowledged) a quoquam by any one. Cultus the attire hominum of men alius was
of another sort, nec neither vultus the countenance idem the same, sermo the
speech mutatus changed, mores the manners diversi diverse. Neque neither miror
do I wonder hoc that this thing evenisse happened Epimenide to Epimenides post
tantorum annorum after so many years, cum whereas idem the same thing
propemodum in a manner evenerit happened Epimenidi to Epimenides post tantum
annorum after so many years. g. Quid what (what say you of) vterque parens
both parents (both father and mother) vivuntne whether are they living? l. ambo
both vivunt do live, and and valent do hold out (or are heart-whole, or are of
ability,) vteunque howsoever confecti weakened (or feeble) senio through old
age, morbo disease denique and in conclusion calamitate through the calamity
bellorum of wars. g. Haec est comoedia this is the comedy humanae vitae of
man's life. Humanae res humane matters sunt are tales such vt that nihil nothing
duret does endure (or continue) in eodem statu in the same state (the matters
of mankind are after such a manner, as that nothing can continue in one stay.)
De inssituenda ratione of disposing the manner studiorum of studies recte
rightly. Discipulus the scholar and and praeceptor the master. d. Mi
charissime praeceptor my most dear master cupio I desire audire to hear ex
te of thee breuiter briefly, quae ratio what manner (or way) studorum of
studies sit may be (or is) instituenda to be appointed recte rightly, si if
modo so that ocium leisure est be tibi to you, and tempus and time commodum
convenient his rebus for these matters. p. Adolescens O youth, tu quidem thou
indeed captasti tempus have watched a time commodum convenient. Deinde moreover
illud tuum liberale and honestum desiderium that thy free and honest desire
libenter gladly anteferrem I should set more by vel even meis maximis
occupationibus than my greatest employments. Quare wherefore praefatione
prefacing omissa being omitted, vt that and both melius cognoscam I may better
know tuum ingenium thy nature (or wit,) and magis probem tibi and may more
prove to thee meam beneuolentiam my good will erga te toward thee, simpliciter
plainly interroga ask me me de rebus concerning things singulis every one by
it self (or in particular concerning every thing one after another) quas which
cupis thou desire scire to know. d. Facis thou do pie godlily and honest
honestly, clarissime praeceptor. O most renowned master, quod because non
grauaris you are not loath crudire to instruct me me beneuole fauerably de his
tantis rebus concerning these so great matters. Itaque therefore primum first
cupio I desire scire to know ex te of you quisnam praecipuus sit finis what is
the chief end nostrorum studiorum of our studies, ad quem unto the which,
velut ad scopum as it were unto a mark (or butte) omnes nostri labores all our
labors discendi of learning debeant onght referri to be referred. p. Tu quidem
thou indeed recte ordiris do tightly begin ab hac questione from this
question. Intellecto enim scopo for the mark being understood et meta and the
goal, ad quam tendimus unto which we make toward, poterimus eligere we shall
be able to choose facilitis more easily etiam also media the means ducentia
leading recta strait way ad istam metam unto that goal (or butte.) Autem but
sunt there are duae propriae et praecipuae dotes hominis two proper and chief
gifts of man, quibus by which antecellit he excels reliquo generi the other
kind animantium of living creatures, ratio reason et and oration speech. His by
these excultis garnished studiose studiously et and recte rightly, homines men
praestant do excel non solum not only caeteris animalibus other living
creatures, verum but inter se among themselves alii some praestant do excel
aliis hominibus other men. Igitur therefore studia the studies literarum of
learning sunt are dirigenda to be directed ad hosce duos fines unto these two
ends proximos next et immediatos and immediate, vt that excolamus we may adorn
rationem reason sapientia by (or with) wisdom, seu or cognitione by the
knowledge Dei of God, naturae of nature, legum of laws, et virtute and by
virtue: et and comparemus may get nobis to our selves facultatem the faculty
orationis of speech explicantis expressing (or declaring) bonas res good things
(or matters) pure ac perspicue purely and plainly. d. Extant ne whether are hi
duo fines these two ends nostrorum studiorum of our studies descripti set down
(or described) apud authors among others brevioribus verbis in shorter words?
p. Maxim yes truly. Pericles enim for Pericles apud Thucydidem in Thucydides
breviter briefly et rotunde and handsomely (or compactly) nominat expresses;
Scire to know quae what thiugs oportet it behooves scire to know, et and posse
to be able eloqui to utter aptly ca those things: Lucianus autem but Lucian
appellat calls (or names) them, cognitionem the knowledge terum of things,
et and facultatem the faculty explicandi of declaring (or expounding) eas them
diserte eloquently (or elegantly, id est that is, sapientiam wisdom et and
eloquentiam eloquence. d. Quid autem but what vocas do you call sapientiam
wisdom? p. Sapientiam wisdom, vt as sacrae literae the sacred Scriptures
loquuntur do speak, nominamus we term veram notitiam the true knowledge Dei
of God, et and aliarum bonarum terum of other good things, coniunctam joined
cum vera pietate with true devotion erga Deum toward God; stultitiam vero but
folly, ignorationem the not knowing, (or the lack of knowledge) Dei of God, et
and inobedientiam disobedience erga Deum toward God. d. Quid autem est
eloquentia but what is eloquence? p. Plato definit Plato does define
eloquentiam eloquence gravissime most substantially, posse to be able (au
ability) dicere to speak grata things acceptable Deo to God. Nam for ad hunc
vltimum finem unto this last and omnes homines all men debent refer ought to
refer omnes suas actiones all their actions, vt that Deus conditor God the
Creator agnoscatur may be acknowledged et colatur and worshipped a nobis of us
recte rightly. 1 Cor. 10. Facite omnia do ye all things ad gloriam Dei to the
glory of God. Quapropter wherefore et both in nostris studiis in our studies,
et and in actionibus in the actions totius vitae of the whole life; sempet
always haec vtilissima regula this most profitable rule debet esse ought to be
in conspectu in sight. Fac make Deum God exordium the beginning et finem and
the end terum of things. Sit igitur let therefore be, finis the end nostrorum
studiorum of our studies, sapiens et eloquens pietas wise and eloquent
godliness, D. Dic quaeso tell I pray, ex quibus doctrinis out of what
doctrines illa sapientia that wisdom et eloquentia and eloquence potissimum
most chiefly sit is petenda to be fetched. P. Sapientia with wisdom seu recto
judicio or a right judgment de rebus concerning matters dignissimis most
worthy cognitione of knowledge, mentem hominis the mind of man instrount there
de instruct theologia divinity, et philosophia and philosophy, qua whereby (or
wherein) complectimur we comprehend, scientiam the knowledge legum of laws seu
or praeceptotum of precepts de moribus concerning manners, historias (and)
histories, quae exempla legum suppeditant which find (or minister
sufficiently) the examples of laws, cognitionem naturalium terum (and) the
knowledge of natural things, et mathemata and the learnings by demonstration
(or the mathematical arts.) D. Ad intelligendam Orationem to understand the
speech aliorum of others, et and ad formandam nostram recte to frame ours
rightly quid praecipue requiritur what chiefly is required? P. Arts dicendi
the arts of speaking, inprimis especially grammaticae the grammars linguae
Latinae of the Latin tongue, et Graecae and of the Greek, et Ebraeae and of
the Hebrow, docent do teach intelligere recte rightly to understand orationem
the speech in sacris et prophanis scriptis in holy and profane writings
sapientium et eloquentium authorum of wise and eloquent authors. Quarum
linguarum monumentis in the monuments of which languages cum seeing that
praecipuae arts et historiae the chief acts and histories contineantur are
contained, cognitio the knowledge earum of them est is velut as it were janna a
gate et elavis and a key qua whereby aditus an entrance aperitur is opened ad
scientiam unto the knowledge doctrinarum of learnings. Vero but ad formandam
nostram orationem recte to frame our own speech rightly, praeter arts dicendi
besides the arts of speaking, idonea natura a fit nature, et lectio and the
reading atque imitatio and also the imitating eloquentium scriptorum of
eloquent writers, et assidua exercitatio and the continual exercise dicendi of
speaking acscribendi and of writing inprimis est necessaria is above other
(principally) necessary. D. Cum autem but whereas praecepta artium dicendi the
precepts of the arts of speaking non sint finis are not the end nostrorum
studiorum of our studies, sed but instrumenta instruments tantummodo only,
quibus whereof in illis summis artibus in those greatest arts, quae which
continent do contain fontes the fountains sapientiae of wisedame et
eloquentiae and of eloquence, et gubernant and do govern actuentur and
maintain humanam vitam man's life, est nobis opus there is to us need (we have
need) vt memini as I remember te disserere that you did discourse inter
docendum at (or between) teaching, cupio scire ex te I desire to know of you,
quantum temporis how much time sit tribuendum is to be bestowed istis artibus
on those arts? P. Adolescens O lad, mones me thou put me in mind recte
well. Non enim for not tota aetas the whole age debet assumi ought to be taken
up in comparando instrumento in getting the instrument (or means) dialecticae
of logic et Rhetoricae and of Rhetoric? Sed praeceptis cognitis but the
precepts being known necessariis necessary ad judicandum et dicendum recte to
judge and speak rightly de rebus of matters (quae which possunt may facile
easily percipi be perceived et cognosci and known intra vnum annum within one
year, si fidelis monstrator if a faithful shewer contingat chance studioso
adolescenti to a studious youth) statim forthwith progrediendum est it is to be
proceeded (one muit go forward) ad summas unto the chief points artium of the
arts, quae contiuent which do contain doctrinam the knowledge (or doctrine)
terum of things (or matters,) et and exercitatio the exercise praeceptorum of
the precepts adjungenda is to be adjoined. d. Ergo therefore vt as in caeteris
artibus mechanicis in other mechanical arts, ita so in studiis in the itudies
doctrinarum of learnings, judicas thou iudgest esse it to be vsum solum use
alone (or only) qui faciat which can make artifices eunning workmen? P. Maxim
yea truly, praesertim especially si if natura idonea a fit nature, si if
magister a master boni judicii of a good judgment, seu or gubernator a guider
(or directer) exercitationis of the exercise vsu peritus by experience skillful
et fidelis and faithful accedat be added to. D. Constituto igitur fine
studiorum the end then of studies being constituted, quem which dixisti you
said esse to be sapientem et eloquentem pietatem wise and eloquent godliness,
quid porro agendum est u hat further is to be done? P. primum first of all
ordine certo in a certain (or true) order, quem fidus et vsu petitus
praeceptor monstrabit which a faithful and by experience a skillful teacher
shall show, attes the arts necessariae necessary vitae for life discendae are
to belearned, et velut and as it were per gradus by the degrees scalarum of
ladders transeundum est it is to be passed (proceeded) ab inferioribus from the
lower ad ^uperieres unto the higher. D. Fortasse peraduenturs eo consilio for
that intent fapiens antiquitas wise antiquity instituit appointed gradus
degrees in scholis in schools, et distinxit and distincted (or distributed)
arts ipsas the arts themselves, vt that videlicet to wit singulos every one
severally velut in classes at it were into forms suo loco in its own (or
proper) place distributas divided, ordine et tempore conveniente in a
convenient order and time juvenilis aetas young age facilius et rectius more
easily and more rightly possit percipere may (or might) learn (or comprehend.)
P. Recte sentis thou think rightly (thou art of a right opinion) nam
impossible est for it is impossible, vt quis that any one faciat can do multa
many things simul together et eadem and the same recte well, vt as Xenophon
dixit Xenophon said verissime most truly. Et lex Platonis and the law of Plato
est sapientissima is most wise, quae which jubet diddeth vnumque^que civem
every Citizen discere et profiteri to learn and profess vnam artem one art
tantummodo only. Quare wherefore quamcunque artem what art soever adolescentes
youths de consilio praeceptoris by the masters counsel instituent discere
shall begin to learn; Cognoscant eam let them know it initio in the beginning
ex vnico libello out of one alone little book tantium only, qui which erudita
methodo with a learned method explicet may unfold sumniam artis the sum of
the art distributam divided in certos locos into certain (or set) places: Nec
neither interea in the mean while sumant in manus let them take into hands
alios libellos other little books ejusdem argumenti of the sapre argument,
priusquam before that edidicerist illum they have learned it without book. D.
Quae what things asseruisti you have affirmed de summis artium concerning the
sums of arts discendis to be learned tantum only ex vnico libello out of one
alone little book conscripto written methodice methodically, (or, what things
concerning learning the sums. etc.) Omnia illa all those things probantur
mihi are approved of me, Nunc porto now further cupio audire ex te I desire to
hear of you, quid sit agendum mihi praecipue what is to be done of me chiefly
in lectione bonorum authorum in reading of good authors. P. In lectione
authorum in reading of authors (vt nihil dicam that I say nothing, de diligenti
auscultatione of diligent hearkening et privata repetitione and private
repeating, quae nullo modo est negligenda which by no means is to be
neglected) vtilsimum est it is most profitable, habere to have communes locos
the commune places distributos divided certo ordine in a certain order, ad
quos unto which omnia insignia all notable (or remarkable) things et digna
cognitione and worthy of knowledge, quae occurrunt which occur in lectione
authorum in reading of authors, annotentur may be noted (or registered) et
digerantur and may be digested velut in certas classes as it were into certain
ranks. D. Sed huic admonltioni but to this advertisement de colligendis
communibus locis concerning gathering common places in certum librum into a
certain book dictum platonis the saying of Plato in Phaedro in Pheadrus
videtur refragari seems to be against, quod monet which aduertiseth, literas
et scripta that letters and writings adferre do bring (or afford or procure)
magis rather occasionem occasion oblivioni et desidiae to forgetfulness and
sloathfulnesse, quam than praesidium help (or furtherance) memoriae to memory
et and doctrinae to learning. Memini etiam I also remember te vsurpare that you
use hanc sententiam this sentence crebris sermonibus in often speeches:
Vnusquisque existimet let every one account se scire tantum that he know so
much, non quanrum not as adservat scriptum he keeps written in libris in
books; sed but quantum as (or how much) tenet he holds memoria in memory
fideliter faithfully, et and habet promptum ready, vbi when as res matter ac
vsus and use postulat requires. P. Vera quidem sunt they are true things
indeed, quae dicis which thou say: sed tamen but notwithstanding habeo I
have quod respondeam what I can answer. Etsi although illa those things quae
which quis any one cupit desires meminisse to remember et scire and to know,
debet inscribere he ought to write in non chart is not papers, sed animo but
the minee; tamen notwithstanding hi indices these inderes (or summaries) et
thesauri and treasures locorum of places, plurimum prosunt do very much
profit, ad recordationem unto remembrance eorum of those things, quae antea
legimus which we have read before, aut didicimus or have learned, et velot
instructum penu sunt and are as it were a furnished store (or provision) ex quo
whereout studiosi adolescentes studious youths possunt depromere may fetch
forth copiam plenty optimarum rerum of the best things, sententiarum sentences,
similitudinum similitudes, historiarum histories, et alia and other things
hujus generis of this kind cum dicendum aut scribendum est when as it is to be
spoken or written de aliqua re of any matter. D. Quid igitur de memoria
sciendum est what then is to be known concerning memory, quam Plutarchus
nominat which Plutarch names promptuarium eruditionis the storehouse of
learning? P. Praecipuus custos the chief keeper et thesaurus and treasure
eruditionis of learning est is memoria memory, cui excolendae for adorning the
which, et formandae and making into fashion assiduo labor ediscendi by the
daily labor of learning by heart singuli studiosi every student debebunt shall
be bound tribu ere certum tempus to bellow a certain time singulis diebus in
every day. D. De art autem memoriae but concerning the art of memory, de qua
whereof audio I hear Simonide^ Chium that Simonides of Chios (or Caeos) et
postea nonnullos alios and afterward some others tradidisse have delivered
quaedam certa praecepta certain sure precepts, quid dicis what say you? P.
Etsi although constat it is manifest memoriam iuvari diaeta that the memory is
helped by diet, et bona valetudine and good health et loco silenti and by a
silent place, et matutino tempore and by the morning time, et certis notis and
by certain notes (set marks:) tamen yet notwithstanding ars memoriae the art
of memory omnium optima et certissima est is the best and surest of all,
ediscere to conne without book multa many things assidue daily (or
continually,) et saepe repetere and often to repent mandata memoriae things
committed to memory, ac ad vsum transfer and to turn unto use. Si enim for
if discentes learners negligent will neglect (or have little regard to)
memoriam memory, et sinent and will suffer (it) enervari to be weakened otio
through idleness desidia slothfulness, torpore drowsiness, aut deliciis
delights, labor discendi the labor of learning erit will be non mimis inanis
not less vain et supervacaneus and superfluous, quam si than if interea in
the mean time scriberent they did write in aqua in water, aut or mandarent did
commit semina seeds arenae to sand (did sow in the sand.) quare wherefore
statuas think thou for a surety vnam that one ex praecipuis et maxim
necessariis partibus studiorum of the chief and most necessary parts of
studies esse is, frequentem et assiduam exercitationem memoriae the frequent
and continual exercise of the memory, et laborem ediscendi multa and the
labor of learning by heart many things. Post culturam memoriae after the due
ordering of the memory, quam which dixi I said potissimum most specially esse
is custodem the keeper (or esse potissimum custodem is the principal keeper)
cognitionis of the knowledge rerum of things, seu or sapientiae of wisdom,
praecipuum the chief et maxim necessarium instrumentum and most necessary
mean (or help) verae et solidae eruditionis of true and sound learnig, est is
diligens et assidua exercitatio styli the diligent and daily exercise of style
(or writing) directa framed ad imitationem ac formam eorum according to the
imitation and form of them, qui locuti sunt which have spoken prudenter
wisely, et perspicue and plainly, et eleganter and elegantly. Vt igitur
Apelles as therefore Apelles, quoties as often as fecisset he had made (or
done, or might had done) nullum opus suae artis no work of his art, velut as
it were deplorans bewailing jacturam the loss diei of a day: solebat dicere he
was wont to say: nullam bodielineam duxi I have drawn no line to day: ita so
studiosi adolescentes sinant let (or may) studious youths suffer nullam diem
elabi no day to pass (or slip away.) in que wherein non connectant they do
not compose vel epistolam either an Epistle, vel partem orationis or part of an
oration, vel versus aliquot or some verses. Ad hanc exercitationem styli unto
this exercise of style (or penning,) si if accesserint there shall be added
vtilissima instrumenta the most profitable means parandae et confirmandae
doctrinae of getting and confirming (or making sure) learning, videlicet to wit
repetitiones repetitions, et examina diligent examinations (parsings,) item
also disputationes disputations, et declamationes scholasticae and
scholasticall declamations, non dubium est there is no doubt, quin but Deo
fortunante nostros labores God prospering our labors, facultas the ability
judicandi of judging (or understanding) et dicendi and of speaking, ac
scribendi and of writing recte rightly, quam initio hujus nostri sermonis which
in beginning of this our speech diximus esse finem nostrorum studiorum we said
was (or is) the end of our studies, sit secutura will follow. ex omnibus autem
but out of all the things, quae dicta sunt which are said (or have been
spoken) facile vides thou easily see, quod diligens scholasticus non sit that
he is not a diligent scholar, qui vagatur which wandreth in studiis in studies
sine certa ratione et ordine without certain reason and order, qui audit omnes
lectiones in schola quotidie sine judicio which hears all lessons (or
lectures) in school daily without judgment, omnia dictata excipit bears
away all dictates (declarations tobe written, or inditures) et coacervat
heapeth up together prolixas rapsodias long (or large) rapsodies (or composures
of verses,) vel quotidie perlegit or daily reads through magnum numerum
paginarum a great number of pages, et grassatur and proceeds (or goes on
rouing) per multos ac varios authors through many and sundry authors. Sed qui
primum but he which first of all prudenter prospicit prudently foreseeth (or
looks unto) finem et metam the end and the goal, ad quam studia sint
dirigenda whereunto studies are to be directed: deinde after that recte eligit
media rightly chooses the means, necessaria ad assequendum illum finem
necessary to attain that end; postea afterward in parandis ac tenendis illis
mediis in getting and keeping (or preserving) those means praestat intentionem
animi performs (or makes) a straining of the mind, curam care, vigilantiam
watchfulness, assiduitatem continual duigence, et laborem and labor. Sed de
his quidem but about these matters indeed hactenus this far (or so much.) Ego
I quae what things de ratione discendi concerning the way of learning, et
studiis recte instituendis and rightly framing studies, partim partly memini
have remembered esse to be tradita delivered a doctissimis viris by most learned
men, partim partly babui have had cognita known propria experientia by mine
own experience, et assiduo vsu and by the continual use discendi of learning
(or observing) impertivi I have imparted ea those things tibi to thee libenter
gladly et fideliter and faithfully, quae vt sint tibi magno vsui the which that
they may be (or that the which may be) to thee great profit (or fruit) precor
deum toto pectore I pray God with my whole heart. d. Quae tu what things you,
praestantissime praeceptor most excellent master, de fine nostrorum studiorum
of the end of our studies, de certo ordine discendi of the certain order of
learning, de discendis summis artium concerning learning the sums of arts ex
vno aliquo libello methodice scripto out of some one little book written
methodically; de colligendis locis communibus concerning gathering common
places: de excolenda memoria of practicing (or polishiug) the memory: de
exercitatione styli of exercising of the style (or manner of penning:) de
repetitionibus et examinibus of repetitions and parsings (or examinations:)
Item like wise de disputationibus et declamationibus scholasticis of
scholasticall disputings and delaimings disseruisti prudenter et graviter you
have declared (or discoursed) wisely and weightily, audivi haec cum tanta
voluptate I have heard these things with so great pleasure, vt sperem that I
hope illa fore vtilissima that they shall be most profitable non sohin, mihi
not only to me, sed et pluribus aliis but to others more, cum quibus decrevi
communicare ipsa with whom I have decreed to communicate them. Cum autem sciam
but whereas I know, parem honorem et pretium equinalent (or meet) honor and
reward non posse referri rendered (or given) a nobis by us, praeceptoribus to
masters, qui impertiunt nobis which impart unto us veram sapientiam true
wisdom, oro toto pectore I beseech with whole heart deum fontem omnis boni et
salutaris doctrinae God the fountain of all good and of wholesome (or saving)
doctrine, vt rependat tibi gratiam cumulate that he recompense (or grant)
favor to you abundantly pro tuis amplissimis beneficiis for your very great
benefits in me unto me, et labores nostros gubemet et adjuvet and govern (or
direct) and further our labors, et nos omnes doceat et regat and teach and
rule us all, vt discamus et doceamus that we may learn and teach grata
Christo acceptable things to Christ, et salutaria ecclesiae ipsius ac nobis and
saving for his Church and our selves. Amen. Finis colloquiorum an end of the
dialogues (or conferences.) In orationem clarissimi viri. d. Iohannis Posselii,
on the oration of the most famous man, master John Posselius epigramma an
Epigramme (or superscription.) Maxima pars the greatest part hominum of men non
cernit perceives not quomodo vivat how it may live; homo a man primum first
discit learneth vivere to live, cum vixit when he has lived. Maxima pars
juvenum the greatest part of young men non cernit sees not quomodo discat how
it may learn: discit discere he learneth to learn, vbi negat when as he
denies se didicisse that he has learned. Sit lex divina let Gods law be nobis
to us regula the rule piae vitae of a godly life; sit ordo bonus let good order
be regula the rule discendi rite of learning well (or even as it should be.)
Quem which haec oration this oration pingens describing perspicuis signis with
evident tokens (or demonstrations) est digna auro is worthy gold, digna Cedro
worthy of Cedar (or immortality) probanda scholis to be approved of schools.
Johannes Frederus D. John Freder doctor. De ratione concerning the way (or
feate) discendae ac docendae linguae latinae ac graecae of learning and
teaching the latin and greek tongue, oration Iohannis Possellij an oration of
John Possellius. Cum when as multa sunt inventa atque instituta many things
have been found out and instituted sapienter wisely a majoribus nostris by our
ancestors, tum then nihil praeclarius nothing more excellent (was invented and
ordained) quam than quod than in hisce publicis congressibus! in these public
assemblies, voluerunt they would non solum not only idoneis hominibus by meet
men honesta testimonia that honest testimonies vitae ac eruditionis of life and
learning tribui be given (or showed,) sed etiam but also orationes that
orations haberi us had (or made) de bonis rebus concerning good things, quibus
auditis which being heard, juv enes young men partim recte erudirentur partly
might be truly instructed de suscipienda and ingredienda ratione studiorum of
undertaking and entering into the way of studies; partim excitarentur partly
might be stirred up ad amorem literarum and virtutis unto the love of learning
and virtue, partim exacuerentur partly might be whetted on (or encouraged
forward) currentes sponte running on (or proceeding) willingly. Non enim for
(or truly) not ad ostentationem eloquentiae aut doctrinae for ostentation of
eloquence or learning recitamus we recite (or openly read or publish) nostras
orationes our orations: Sed vt imperator bonus et industrins but as a good and
industrious commander (or general) instructa acie in an army set in array
(ready to fight,) dat gives tyronibus to young soldiers quaedam certa
praecepta pugnandi certain sure precepts of fighting, deducit he diswadeth a
timore from fear perterritos the sore afraid ones, et hottatur and exhorts
paratos ac fortes milites the ready furnished and valiant soldiers ad
pugnandum strenue to fight stoutly: ita nos solemus so we are wont in hisce
conuentibus in these assemblies et imperitiores docere both to teach the
unskillful ones et languentes excitare and to encourage the languishing (or
slothful) ones, and inflammare ad verum decus and to incense unto true honor
paratos the ready ones ac ingressos pleno gradu and having (or such as have)
made entrance with a great pace (or full stride.) Hi fines cum nobis in dicendo
propositi sint whereas these ends are proposed of us in speaking, non dubium
est there is no doubt, quin omnes sapientes viri but all wise men, cum multos
alios veteres et honestos mores both many other ancient and honest customs cum
and also hos scholasticos gradus these school degrees et spectacula
promotionum and spectacles of promotions, in quibus de ejusmodi bonis rebus
disserimus wherein we discourse of good matters of this sort, magnifaciant do
make high account of, colant do honor, et putent esse and account to be
ornanda things to be adorned et conservanda and to be maintained. Cum autem but
whereas hoc tempore at this time ratio officij the consideration of duty
imponat mihi necessitatem imposes on me a necessity dicendi of speaking, et
encomia hominum praestantium and the praises of excellent men, ac rerum omnium
consensione laudatarum and of things praised by the consent of all men, item
also paraineseis admonitions et vtiles adhortationes and profitable
exhortations ab alijs by others, qui eloquentia valent which are mighty in
eloquence (or are of great eloquence) saepe hic recitatae sunt are here
oftentimes recited, breuiter indicare decreui I have decreed briefly to show,
qua ratione by what way lingua latina et graeca the latin and greek tongue
commode discenda et docenda sit is to be learned and taught conveniently (or
profitably.) Hoc argumentum etsi oratorem plenum atque perfectum requirit,
although this argument requires a complete and perfect orator: tamen cum non
tam verba et actio dicentis, quam res, quae dicuntur, spectandae sint, yet
notwithstanding whereas not so much the words and action of the speaker, as the
things, which are said, are to be considered, dicam de hac materia illa I will
say of this matter (or argument) those things, quae partim ipse longo vsu,
which partly I myself by long use (or practice) partimaliorum prudentium
hominum judicio ac testimonio edoctus partly taught by the judgment and
testimony of other prudent men, judicabo vera esse shall judge to be true, et
cum ce ipsa congruere and to agree with the matter it self. Ac a vobis,
clarissimi viriet studiosi iuvenes, amanter peto, and of you O most famous men,
and studious youths (or young men) I crave lovingly (or as a friend) vt me
benign attenteque audiatis that you hear me gently (or favorably) and
attentively, quod vestra sponte facitis which ye do of your own accord.
Perficiam enim, deo juvante, for I will perform, God helping, vt fateamini me
dixisse non omnino inepte aut perperam that ye may confess that I have spoken
not altogether from the purpose or amiss, de re tam vtili et necessaria of a
matter so profitable and necessary. Primum autem videtur mihi but first of
all, it seems to me (that it is to be spoken) de tempore concerning the time,
quo pueri in scholas lat tinas ducendi, wherein youths are to brought into
latin schools, equi labores ipsis imponendi sint and what labors (taskes)
are to be imposed on them. Deinde de exercitijs scribendi after that of the
exercises of writing, et ratione emendandi scripta, and the way (or reason) to
amend writings. Postea afterward quando graeca debeant proponi when greek
matters ought to be propounded, et quo ordine and modo illa tradi and in what
order and manner (these ought) to be delivered. Postremo de exercitijs grae cis
esse dicendum ^ast of all that is to be spoken concerning greek exercises.
Pueri literis adhibendi sunt boys are to be set to learning anno aetatis sex
to vel septimo in the sixth or seventh year of age, si omnino fieri potest if
at all it can be done, tunc enim ingenia for then wits non plane stupida and
tarda not utterly (or quite and clean) dull and slow (or hard) ad percipiend^m
doctrinam idonea sunt are fit to receive (or conceive) learning. Et simulac
latina legere nouerunt and as soon as they know to read latin (or latin
writings,) proponendae sunt illis octo parts orationis there are to be
propounded to them the eight parts of speech ex puerili aliquo libello
compendiose scripto out of some puerile (or belonging or fit for youth) little
book compendiously written, and assuefiant ad ediscenda paradigmata
declinationum and conjugationum and let them be accustomed to learn by heart
the patterns of the declensions and coniugations, and vocabula rerum ex
compendio Hadriani Iunij and the names (or terms) of thing out of the
abridgement (or short form) of Hadrian Iunius aur simili libello or from the
like little book, cu^^s germanica versio cum puerorum idiomate congruat whose
dutch translation may agree with the proper form of speech of the children.
Quorsum enim at^^net for to what purpose pertains it (tends it) pueros
reddere verba non intellecta psittaci more that children do render words not
understood in Parrat wise (or after the manner of a Parrat,) and eos inutili
labor onerare and to burden them with an unprofitable labor? his addatur
Cato to these may be added Cato, and similia dicta sententiosa and the like
sententious sayings, ex prouerbijs Salomonis and Syracide out of the proverbs
of Solomon and out of the son of Syrach, proprie and latin redditis rendered
(or translated) properly and after the form and fashion of latin hi enim duos
authors for these two authers, long superant omnes gnomologo^ scriptores
far surpass all sentence-vttering writers and rerum bonitate and figurarum
venustate both in the goodness of the things (or matters) and in the pleasant
grace of figures, quae pueris proprie and perspicue explicentur, which may be
expounded to the children properly and plainly, and in cuius repetitione
singulae voces examinentur, and in the repeating whereof all words particularly
may be examined, vt pueri discant that children may learn, and parts
orationis probe nouisse both well to know the parts of speech, and exact
nomina and verba inflectere and exactly to decline nounes and verbs In his cum
annum vnum aut alterum exercitati sunt when as they are (or have been)
exercised in these things one year or two, proponenda est ^^^is grammatica
latina the latin grammar is to be propounded (or expounded) to them, breuiter
and neruose summam artis continens briefly and pithily containing the sum (or
chief) of the art, quae assidue tractanda, inculcanda, and illustranda est
which continually is to be handled, beaten into mind, and to be illustrated,
exemplis ex probatis authoribus desumptis by examples taken out of approved
authors. Neque in his preceptis nimis diu magister immorabitur neither in these
precepts a master shall abide over long, vt quidem aliquando fit as also truly
sometimes it is done, and ego memini and I remember in quadam schola in a
certain school, grammat^cam ad finem perductam esse that the grammar was
brought to an end (or finished, or continued,) integro quinquennio in a whole
five years spa^e (or that the grammar was in teaching five whole years) cum
industrius praeceptor possit absolvere came facile sex mensium spacio whereas an
industrious teacher can easily dispatch it in the space of six months. Neque
propter aliquos hebetes and stupidos neither by reason of some slow and dull
ones, alij bonae indolis pueri negligendi sunt other boys of good towardness
or aptness) are to be neglected. Saepe enim magistri vna and eadem opera for
oftentimes masters by one and the same labor, volentes inseruire multis,
ijsque diuersi progressus discipulis willing to serve many scholars, and those
of a diverse progress, remorantur and impediunt alios bonos ingenio praeditos
do stay and hinder others endued with a good wit. His igitur qui jam superiorem
classem ascenderunt to these therefore which already have come upon (or are
past) the former form, epistolae Ciceronis, and similia s^ripta proponenda
sunt the epistles of Cicero and the like writings are to be proposed. Vt autem
pueri non nimis di^ in discendis praeceptis grammatices detine^di sunt, but as
youths are not to be detained over long in learning the precepts of grammar:
Sic damnanda and explodenda est illorum sententia so the opinion of them is to
be condemned and to be rejected, qui dicunt liberalia ingenia lab^re ediscendi
praecepta non oneranda that free wits (or courages) are not to be burdened
with the labor of learning by the heart rules (or precepts,) sed linguam
latinam lecti^ne bon^rum auth^rum tantum disc^ndam esse but that the latin
tongue is only to be learned by the reading of good authors. Etsi enim
praecepta and regulae grammaticae ad re^te loquendum and scribendum non
suffi(...)unt for although precepts and grammar rules do not suffice unto
speaking and writing well: tamen propter maximas and necessarias causas,
diligenter and accurate disci debent yet for very great and necessary causes
they ought to be learned diligently and exactly. Et quia his pueris and because
unto these boys, quos secundae classis auditores nomino whom I term scholars
of the second form, authors proponuntur authors are declared (or read) non
tam causa sapienciae seu rerum not so much for the sake of wisdom or matters,
quam orationis formandae as of forming (or bringing into fashion) the speech
praeceptor op^ram dabit the master shall give endeavor, vt singulari
diligentia monstret pueris that with singular diligence he do show unto the
boys vim and significationem ac pondera verborum the force and signification,
and weightinesse of words, item similium seu synonymorum differentias likewise
the differences of the like words or synonymaes (words of one signification)
phrases the fashions of speaking, compositionem the composing together, and
similem effi^gendae orationis rationem and the like reason of e^pressing (or
representing) a speech. Quod quo rectius and commodius fieri possit to the end
that the which may be done more rightly and more aptly, ostendat in scriptis
Ciceronis he may show in the writings of Cicero, quae locutiones a materna
lingua discedant what speakings do differ from the mother tongue, quomodo hanc
vel illam sententia^ germanice explicaremus how we should express this or that
sentence in duteh, item in quibus vernaculam linguam imitemur likewise wherein
we may imitate the natural language, in quibus vero non and wherein not: vt
hac ratione pueri discant that by this means boys may learn latinitatem a
germanismis separa^e to distinguish latin from dutch manners of speaking, and
pure and eleganter latin loqui ac scribere and to speak and to write in
latin both purely and elegantly, ac Ciceronis scripta inprimis amare and
especially to love the writing of Cicero, memores dicti Quintiliani being
mindful of the saying of Quintilian: ille sciat se multum profecisse, let him
know that he has much profited, cui Cicero valde placebit whom Cicero shall
greatly like. Ante omnia autem cauendum est but before all things it is to be
bewared, ne sine discrimine scriptores praelegantur that not without difference
writers be read (before scholars) and pueri turbentur varia and multiplici
authorum auditione and boys be troubled with sundry and manifold hearing of
authors, constat enim plaerosque authors for it is manifest that authors for
the most part inter se dissimill^mos esse are among themselves very unlike,
non solum tota orationis genere none only in the whole kind of speech; sed
etiam vocibus and modis loquendi but also in words and manners of speaking.
Quod multi boni viri hoc nostro tempore as for that many good men in this our
time, qui magnum laborem and studium in scientia aliqua praeclara and vtili
posuerunt which have bestowed great labor and study in some famous and
profitable science, priuentur tamen illa vera gloria are notwithstanding
deprived of that true glory, quod non literata oratione because not in a
learned style (or speech) ea quae tenent those things which they hold possint
vel proferre, vel literis mandare they can either express, or commit to
letters (or writing,) nulla alia causa est there is none other cause quam
infaelicitas primae aetatis than the misfortune of the first age, quae aptis
lection^bus and necessarijs exercitijs which by fit lessons (or readings) and
necessary exercises, ad linguam latinam non est informata was not informed (or
fashioned or instructed) unto the latin tongue. Audio I hear say doctissimum
virum lo^annem Capni^nem interrogatum that the mo(...) learned man John Capnion
being demanded, cur hoc tempore homines non tam docti essent why in this time
men were not so learned, quam temporibus Cicer^nis and Quintili^ni as in the
times of Cice^o and Quintilian, respondisse answered, illos tunc habuisse
paucos libros that they then had few books, cosque bonos and the same good,
quos diligenter and assidue legendo sibi familiarissime confecissent which by
reading diligently and continually they had made most familiarly known to
themselves; Nunc autem homines obruere se variet te and copia librorum but now
that men ouerwhelme (or conthemselues found with the variety and multitude of
books. S^ vere cogitare volumus if we will consider truly, non omnino errauit
Capnion Capnion erred not altogether. Nusqua^ enim est, qui vbique est for he
is no where, which is every where. Et qui, quo destinauit, pervenire vult, and
he which will reach through (or come home) whither he has appointed, vna^
sequatur via^ let him follow one way, non per multas vagetur let him not wander
through many: istud non ire sed errare est that is not to go but towander, vt
vere and sapienter-Seneca dixit as Senecasaid truly and wisely. Quare explosa e
ludis pueroru praecipue authoru multitudine wherefore the multitude of authors
chiefly being rejected forth of the schools of children, vnum genus sermonis
idque optimum proponatur, let one kind of s^eech and that the best be
proposed, in quo tantisper deti(...)ur wherein so long let them be detained, dum
possi^t omnia pure and (...) pr^ferre until they can utter all things purely
and in latin wi^e, et au(...)ris (...) ac ^lega^tiam loquendo and scribendo

author in speaking and writing: and dum ad alios veteres and recentiores
scriptores tuto admittentur and until they shall be safely admitted unto other
ancient and later writers, quos non minori came vtilitate quam iudicio,
pervolutabunt whom they shall turn often over (or read over diligently, not
with less profit than judgment. De exercitio latin loquendi hic non dicam I
will not speak here conce^ning the exercise of spea(...)ing of latin. Sciunt
enim viri docti and s^pi(...) for learned and wise men do know, id omnino
necessa^ium esse that that is altogether necessary, and sine magno discentium
incommodo negligi aut omitti non posse and cannot be neglected or omitted
without the great hurt of the learners Qualia autem exercitia pueris proponenda
sint, but what manner exercises may be to be propounded to youths, paucis
indicabo I ^^ill show in sew words, si prius dixero if I shall before tell,
quibus virtutibus ludimagistri and paedag^gi praediti esse debeant with what
virtues schoolemasters and teachers of children ought to be endued. Primum
necesse est eos, qui alios vtiliter ^rudire volent, latin doctos esse first it
is necessary that they be learned in latin, which will instruct others
profitably: and vias ac rations docendi expeditissimas tenere and to know the
readiest ways and reasons (or feats) of teaching: and humanitate ac (...)
acultate delectandi and excitandi pueros valere and be of power (or of much
e^imation) by reason of humanity and the faculty of delighting and of stirring
up youths. Quomodo enim potest alios docere for how can he teach others, qui
ipse pure and emendate loqui nec potest, who himself can neither speak purely
and without fault nec idipsum loquendo et pronunciando praestare nor perform
that very thing in speaking and uttering quod a suis discipulis requirit which
he requires of his scholars? Deinde furthermore, cum maximam vim habeat ad
foelicem in studiis progressum via and ratio docentis whereas the way and
manner of the teacher has the greatest force unto an happy progress in
studies, prudens magister omnia dextre and explicate proponet a prudent master
shall propound all things properly (or f^atly) and plainly, and discipulos in
illis, quae proposita sunt, vtiliter exercebit and shall profitably exercise
the scholars in those things, which are propounded; id autem, quomodo fieri
debeat, suo loco clarius ostendemus but that, how it ought to be done, we will
show more manifestly in its place. Quantum vero humanitas praeceptoris and
alacritatis and amoris erga bonas literas adfert but how much both
cheerfulness and love unto good learning the court^u^e of the master
brings, tantum saevitia and crudelitas teneros and imbecillos a^imos frangit,
and a studiis deterret so much the fierceness and cruelty does daunt tender
and weak minds (or courages,) and does a^^right from studies. Quare
meminerint praeceptores wherefore shall (or let) masters remember, Se erga
discipulos, vt erga filios, affectos esse oportere that they ought to be
affected toward scholars, as toward sons, nec vel nimia austeritate nor
either by overmuch severity, vel plagis or by s^ripes, vel diris
execrationibus or by terrible cutsings, ignic ulum a natura datum, extinguere
to quenc^ the spark given by nature, sed potius comitate paterna excitare and
inflammare debere but rather ought to stir up and to inflame (it) with a
fatherly gentleness. Neque ve^o haec ita accipienda sunt neither truly these
things are so to be taken, quasi pueri ignavi and contumaces debita poena
coercendi non ^unt as if ^^oathfull and sullen (or stubborn) boys are not to
be constrained (or kept in) by due punishment, aut virgis in scholis omnino non
sit vtendum or that one must not use rods at all in schools, vt quidem
nonnulli existimant as indeed some do think. Nam vt pius et (...)

tempestivas castigationes but also by discipline, that is, by inuring, daily
exercises, examples, and seasonable corrections nam haec quatuor appellation^
disciplinae continentur for these ^oure are contained in the name (or naming)
of discipline et memor dicti Salomonis and minde^ull of the saying of Solomon:
Pater qui parcit virgae odit suum filium the father which spares the rod,
hates his son: pueros petulantes ferula caedit beats the wanton (or
malapert) boys with the paulmer, eamque collocat in conspectu liberorum and
sets it in sight of the children, vt semper incurrens in oculos that always
coming unto the eyes (or into their sight,) eos in disciplina retineat may
retain them in discipline, e^ lasciviam coerceat and may restrain
wantonness. Ita praeceptori so a master, qui parentum vicarius est which is
one in stead of the parents, et eorum parts sustinet and executoth their
duties, vtendum est (...)em mediis institutione discipulorum must use the same
means in instruction of scholars; quare nec virgae nec aliae opportunae
animadversiones wherefore neither rods, nor other convenient punishments, ex
scholis tolli aut debe^ aut possunt either ought or may be taken out forth of
schools. Est enim metus poenarum velut (...) (Ergodio^tes) for the fear of
punishments is as it were an hastener forward of the ^orke, et custos officii
ac diligentiae dis^ipulorum and a preserver of the duty and diligence of the
scholars, sine quo without which, maxim in hac delira mundi senecta
especially in this doting old age of the world, cum mores juventutis ad nimiam
ignaviam et contumaciam incubuerunt when as the manners of youth have been
inclined unto overmuch ^^oathfulnesse and stubbornness, Florens illa aetas in
officio retineri non potest that flourishing age cannot be retained (or held
in) in duty. Sed in omnibus modus est servandus but in all things measure is to
be kept, et ira removenda and anger to be put a^ ay, cum qua nihil recte fi^ri,
nihil considerate potest with which nothing can be done rightly, nothing
considerately. Sed jam ad id, vnde digressus sum, revertar but now I will
return to that whence I digressed. Primum scribendi exercitationis genus est
the first kind of the exercise of writing is, puero illa, germanice reddita
proponere to propound to a boy those things rendered in Dutch, quae in Cicerone
observanda esse audivit which he has heard are to be observed in Cicero,
temporibus, personis, locis, rebus etiam nonnihil commu^atis the ^imes,
persons, places, yea and the things somewhat altered, quae ad imitationem
Ciceronis in Latinum sermonem convertat which (the a^oresaid obseruable
matters) he may turn into Latin speech after the imitation of Cicero. Ratio
autem emendandi scripta omnium optima (...) simplicissima est but of all the
best and most since^e way of amending writings is (or the best and plainest way
of correcting the writings of all is,) non praeceptoris arbitrio not according
to the pleasure of the master, sed ipsius Ciceronis judicio but after the
judgment of Cicero himself, pueri compositionem emendare to amend the boys
composition (of words,) illiusque epistolam vel locum, ei proponere and to
propound to him his Epistle or place, ex quo scribendi argumentum desumptum est
from whence the argument of writing is taken, velut exemplar et speculum as it
were a pattern and looking-glass, in quo videat wherein he may s^^, quid suo
labori desit what is wanting to (or for) his labor. Nihil autem pernitiosius
studiis linguae Latinae accidere potest but nothing can happen more pernicious
to the studies of the Latin tongue, quam quod pueri, neglecta omni imitatione
than that boys all imitation neglected, a suis magistris magis quam a Cicerone
ipso, of their masters rather than of Cicero himself, et similibus authoribus
bonis and other like^ good authors, latinitta^m discere coguntur are enforced
to learn Latin. Accediteo there appertains to this matter (or moreover then
this) quod illa saepe praeceptores pueris vertenda praescribunt that oftentimes
masters prescribe those things to be translated by the boys (or prescribe to
the boys those things to be translated,) quorum vel appellationes vel loquendi
modos nunquam antea audiverunt whereof either the names or manners of speaking
they never heard before. Imo quae ipsi praedagogi, quomodo recte et proprie
reddenda sunt, ignorant yea which the schoolemasters themselves know not how
they are to be rendered rightly and properly. Quare ante omnia cavebit
praeceptor wherefore before all things the master shall beware, ne puerum vel
scribere vel loqui permittat that he suffer not the boy either to write or to
speak, nisi istis modis et rationibus quas non a se, sed ab optimis authoribus
didicerit unless in those manners and forms, which he has learned not from
him, but from the best authors. Quod si tale argumentum propositum est that if
such an argument (or matter to be written of) be propound^d, cujus exemplum
integrum in authore non extat whereof a whole example is not extant in an
author, vt nec semper extare potest as neither always it can be extant,
emendator illud ipsum argumentum quod discipul^ tractarunt, propriis verbis et
phrasibus praeclare retextum et ^laboratum illis proponat the correctour may
propound that very argument which the scholars have handled, very well changed
clean otherwise and elaborated (or eractly done with study,) in proper words
and phrases, in quo sicut et in Cicerone cernant in which as even in Cicero
they may see, quld suo scripto desit what is wanting to their own writing, and
quantum ab illa forma discrepet and how much it differs from that form.
Deinde vbi aliquandiu in hoc exercitio versati sunt afterward when as some
while they have been conversant in this exercise, and in eo aliquid
profecerunt and have profited some what therein, ad majora deducendi sunt they
are to be led along unto greater matters, and curandum and it is to be cared,
vt Ciceronis scripta faciliora that the easier writings of Cicero, and
praecipue epistolas ad verbum a praeceptore germanico sermonere(...) a(...)
chiefly the Epistles by the master rendered according to the word (word for
word) in the Dutch speech, non inspecto exemplari the pattern (or coppie) not
looked into, suo mart latin vertant by their own proper wit (or endeavor)
do turn into Latin, quae ad eundem, quem dixi, modum emendandae sunt which
are to be amended after the same manner which I said. Quod si assidue fit the
which if it be continually done, non dubium est there is no doubt, quin facile
pueri ad pure and eleganter scribendum assuesiant but easily the boys may be
inured to write purely and elegantly. Vt enim for as, cum in sole ambulamus for
as when we walka broad in the Sun, etiamsi ob aliam causam ambulemus although
we walk for another cause, tamen coloramur notwithstanding we are steyned (or
colored:) sic fierinon potest so it cannot come to pass, quin cum hoc modo
puer exercetur but when as a boy is ereccised in this manner, ejus oration
assiduo illo vsu and consuetudine coloretur his speech by that continual use
and custom may be died (or have a timture) and puritatem ac suavitatem
quandam Ciceroneanam redoleat and may savor of a certain Ciceronian purity
and sweetness (or pleasantness.) Tertium exercitii genus est the third kind
of exercise is, orationem latinam, aliis verbis Latinis, and Ciceroni vsitatis,
exprimere to express a Latin speech in other Latin words, and also much used
of Cicero. Verum id exercitium non ad hos pueros, sed ad perfectiores, and cos
magis, qui characterem orationis effingere, quam qui Latin tantum loqui and
scribere discunt, proprie pertinet but that exercise properly pertains not to
these boys, but unto perfecter, and those rather which learn to resemble a
style of speech, (or to devise a like form of words,) than which learn only
to speak and write in Latin. Vt autem haec scribendi exercitia diligenter and
fideliter colenda sunt but as these exercises of writing are to be practiced
diligently and faithfully: Sie et latin lo quendi exercitatio, de qua paulo
ante dixi nequaquam, negligi debetso also the exercise of speaking in latin,
whereof I spoke a little before, in no wise ought to be neglected. Quod quo
rectius fieri possit the which that it may be done the righter (or to the end
that the which may be done more rightly.) Custodes seu corycei constituendi
sunt watchers or spies are to be set, qui et juniores teutonice loquentes, et
grandiores vel Germanismis vel soloecismis, vel denique barbarismis vtentes,
annotent which may note (or put in writing) both the younger speaking
Leutonicely (or in low Dutch,) and the elder using either Germanismes (or
proprieties of the high Dutch) or incongruities; or finally Barbarismes, et ad
magistrum deferant, a quo iusta poena afficiantur and may appeach (or report
them) unto ths master, by whom they may be afflicted with just punishment (or
be duly punished.) Vtrumque enim exercitium for both exercises, latin
scribendi et loquendi of writing and speaking in Latin, in Latinis scholis
vigere debet ought to flourish (or be in force) in Latin schools, nec
alterum ab altero separari potest neither can the one be severed from the
other. Nam vt prudentis et industrii informatoris est for as it is the part of
a wise and industrious instructor, indicare et proponere puero to show and to
propound to a boy, illa quae singulari studio, observanda, exercenda, et
imitanda sunt those things which with singular study are to be obscrued,
exercised, and imitated: Sic is eadem non solum scriptione, sed etiam
locutione, imitabitur so he shall imitate the same, not only in writing, but
also in speaking. Dixi de ratione servanda in instituendis pueris in lingua
latina I have spokeu of the form to be kept in instructing youths in the
Latin tongue, vsque ad annum aetatis vndecimum aut duodecimum even until the
eleventh or twelfth year of age: Restat nunc, vt breviter disseram de ratione
tradendae et discendae linguae Graecae it remains now that I briefly
discourse of the manner of teaching and learning the Greek tongue. Quod pauci
nostrum consequuntur aliquam mediocrem cognitionem Graecae linguae that few of
ours do attain any mean (or indifferent) knowledge of the Greek tongue, vel
quod studium ejus videtur nobis perdisficile or that the study thereof seems
to us very hard, nulla alia causa est there is none other cause, quam quod aut
serius suscipimus hoc studium than that either somewhat late we undertake this
study; aut si suscipimus or if we do undertake, frigide in eo versamur we
are coldly (remissely) conversant in it, nec eo ordine et modo, quo decet, in
eo progredimur neither in that order, and manner, wherein it becomes, do we
proceed therein. Vt autem in omnibus aliis rebus recte, tempestive, et
foeliciter perficiendis but as in all other things to be performed rightly,
seasonably, and prosperously: Sic et in discendis graecis literis so also in
learning the Greek tongue, ordo conveniens omnino necessarius est a convenient
order is altogether necessary. Quare vbi ab anno aetatis sexto vel septimo
wherefore when as from the firth or seventh year of age vsque ad annum
vndecimum even until the eleventh year, in latina, lingua, ea, qua dixi,
ratione pueri exercitati sunt boys are exercised in the Latins tongue, in that
manner wherein I said, (his enim sex annis, nisi plane tardi et indociles sunt,
linguam Romanam vtcunqne discere possunt for in these six years, unless they
be utterly slow and unteachable, they may learn the Latin tongue after a
sort (or so so.) Graeca vocabula ex evangeliis, vt vocant, dominicalibus, ipsis
proponantur, the Greek wdrds out of the Gospels, as they call Domimcall ones,
(or Sundaies ones) let be propounded to them, quorum quotidie aliquot ediscant
recitent, whereof some daily let them learn by heart, let them recite, et
octavo quoque die illa, quae praeterita hebdomade didicerunt, ab initio
repetant, and on every eighth day let them repeat those things from the
beginning, which they have learned in the weekepast. Vt enim liberalia ingenia
facillime res bonas arripiunt et addiscunt for as frank wits most easily take
quickly and learn good things: Sic eadem ipsis facile excidunt so the same
things easily do slip from them, si non diligenti et assidua repetitione
inculcentur if they be not poured in (or beaten into memory) by diligent and
continual repetition. His paradigmata declinationum et conjugationum graecarum
addantur, to these things let be added the patterns of the Greek declensions
and coniugations, in quibus certis diebus exercendi sunt in which they are to
be exercised certain days. In hoc studio cum annum consumpse^runt when as
they have spent a year in this study, evangelia graeca, non inspecta versione
latina interpretari jubebuntur they shall be bid to interpret the Greek
Gospels, the Latins translation not looked in. Et quia hujus classis
auditoribus nunc grammatica graeca integre proponitur, and because to the
scholars of this form now the Greek grammar is propounded entirely, non
solum in nominum ac verborum inflexionibus, sed etiam in temporibus verborum
activae, passivae, et mediae vocis formandis, ac regulis graecae Syntaxeos
praecipuis et maxim necessariis cum vno et altero exemplo ediscendis operam
ponent they shall bestow viligence not only in the declinings of nounes and
verbes, but also in forming the tences of verbs of the active, passive, and
medium (or middle or mean) voice, and in cunning by heart the chief and most
necessary rules of the Greek Syntaris with one or another example. Diligenter
autem et accurate, vt dixi, hisce pueris Grammatica graeca ediscenda est but
diligently and accurately, as I said, the Greek grammar is to be learned
without book by these boys, quam qui tenet the which he that keeps in
remembrance, sciat se deuorasse maximam partem molestiae let know that he has
sustained and passed over the greatest part of the totle, quae suscip^enda et
perferenda est in discenda hac lingua which is to be undertaken and sustained
in learning this tongue. Proponi autem quatuordecim, quindecim vel sedecim
annorum adolescentulis debent Socratis oration ad Demonicum et Nicoclem, et
illa, quae Nicocles insCribitur but to lads of fourteen, fifteen or sixteen
years, there ought to be propounded the oration of Socrates unto Demonicus and
Nicocles, and that, which is entitled Nicocles; Plutarchi paedagogia Plutarchs
pedagogie (or treatise of training up young children,) faciliores et lepidiores
dialogi Luciani the easier and pleasanter dialogurs of Lucian, et fabulae
Aesopi and Iesops fables: Ex quibus praeter verborum copiam out of which
besides the store of words, phrases et variarum rerum appellationes the phrases
and names of diverse things, magnam sapientiae partem de gubernandis consiliis,
a great part of the wisdom concerning governing intents (or aduices,)
actionibus et moribus actions and manners, sine vllo taedio tenera a tas
discere potest tender age may learn without any weariness of mind. Et quia
varietas delectat, ac voluptatem parit and because variety delights and
causes pleasure, graeca poemata, cujusmodi sunt, aurea carmina Pythagorae,
Phocylides et postea Hesiodus, ac quidam libri Homeri, lectioni oratorum
admiscendi erunt Greek poemes, of which sort are, the golden vorses of
Pythagoras, Phocylides, and afterward Hefiod, and certain books of Homer,
shall be to be intermeddled to the reading of Drators. His auditoribus,
singulis scptimanis breve argumentum Latinum proponendum est to these learners,
in every week a short Latin argument (or sum of a matter written) is to be
propounded, quod ad imitationem Isocratis, Demosthenis, et similium authorum,
in graecum sermonem convertant which after the imitation of Isocrates,
Demosthenes, and of like authors, they may turn into the Greek speech. Nam vt
in lingua Latina optimos quosque authors et legimus et imitamur for as in the
Latin tongue we both read and imitate all the best authors: Sic et in graeca
idem facere, et nostram orationem ad graecorum authorum sermonem effingere
debemus so also we ought to do the same in the Greek tongue, and to frame
our style according to the speech of the Greek authors. Nec imitandi sunt, qui
ex dictionario, vel Synonymis graecis, epistolas graecas, aut versus
consarcinare solent neither are they to be imitated, which are wont to patch up
greek Epistles, or verses out of a Dictionary, or greek Synonymaes. Debet
etiam hitce, de quibus dixi, discipulis, liber aliquis epistolarum Ciceronis,
qui facilior et elegantior videbitur, prop^ni, quem ordine graece vert^^t, et
praeceptori certis horis exhibeant, there ought also to be propounded to these
scholars, of whom I have said, some book of the epistles of Cicero, which
shall seem the easier and the eleganter, which in order they may turn into
Greek, and may show to the (...) at certain hours. Hoc enim si fecerint,
eadem opera purit tem latini sermonis et graecam linguam addiscent for this if
they will do, with the same labor they shall learn the purity of the Latin
speech, and the Greek tongue. Emendandi autem haec scripta, via expeditissima
est; but the readiest way to amend these writings is, Primum vitia, si quae
sunt, comiter indicare, et vel ipsum authorem, ex quo argumentum scribendi
depromptum est, vel praeceptoris elaboratain versionem quam cum sua conferant,
ipsis ob oculos proponere, first of all gently to show the faults, if there be
any, and to set to them before the eyes, either the author himself, from whom
the argument of writing is taken out, or the masters translation exactly done,
which they may compare with their own. Ad hoc vtile exercitium, et illud
accedere debet, vt certis quibusdam horis nihil aliud ipsis loqui liceat, nisi
graece. Unto this profitable exercise, also this ought to be added, that it be
lawful for them in certain appointed hours to speak no other thing (nothing
else) than in Greek. Vt enim in lingua Latina, sic et in graeca illa, quae
puer audivit, non solum scribendo, sed etiam loquendo ad vsum transfer docet
for as in the Latin tongne, so also in the Greek, those things, which the boy
has heard, he teach to transfer (or turn) to use, not only by writing, but
also by speaking. Neque est quod quisquam vereatur, ne pueri difficultate
quadam aut obscuritate, a studio hujus linguae deterreantur neither is there
(cause) that any one fear, least boys by some difficulty or obscurity, be
deterred from the study of this tongue. Nam vt ipsi natura peregrinarum
linguarum amantes sunt, easque facile ad discunt, for as they by nature are
lovers of foreign languages, and do learn them easily: Sic nulla alia
lingua jucundior est, nec suaviore sono amibus illabitur, quam graeca, so no
other tongue is more pleasant, neither with a sweeter sound enters into the
ears, than the Greek. Quare vt requies suave condimentum laboris est vt
graecum dictum, wherefore as rest is the sweet sauce of labor, as the Greek
saying, he ano pausis rest estin is artuma the sauce ton ponon of labor monet
aduertiseth: Ita graecarum literarum studium reliquis discendi laboribus non
modo taedium nullum adfert, sed eos etiam jucundi res reddit, et quadam
oblectatione ac voluptate tanquam sale perspergit so the study of the Greek
tongue not only brings no yekiomitesse to the remaining labors of learning,
but makes them also more pleasant, and springleth them all over with certain
delight and pleasure as with salt. Quod autem de graecae linguae studio ejusque
exercitis hacrenus dixi, but what hitherto I have spoken concerning the study
of the Greek tongue, and the exercises thereof, non ita intelligendum est it
is not so to be understood, quasi interealatinae lectiones prorsus omittendae
aut de ponendae vel etiam musica, Arithmetica et initia dialectices et
rhetorices, his grandioribus non vna tradendae sint as if in the mean while
latin readings he (or were) altogether to be omitted or laid aside, or also
music a ithmeticke, and the beginnings of Logic and Rhetoric not to be
together taught to those elder (or of more years.) Debet enim simul ac latinae
linguae fundamentum jactum est, vtriusque linguae, latinae et graecae, studium
simul in scholis slorere et dominari for as soon as the foundation of the
Latin tongue is laid, the study of both tongues, the Latin and the Greek,
ought to flourish and to have the souaraigntie together in the schools. Maxim
cum haec linguarum inter se collatio tantas habeat opportunitates, vt vtramque
hoc modo et citius et facilius simul, quam alteram separatim pueri discere
possint especially seeing that this comparing of languages between themselves
has so great commodities, that by this means boys may learn both sooner and
easier both together, than one apart. Vt enim latina lingua sine graeca non
intelligitur, sic ne graeca sine latina explicari et tradi potest for as the
Latin tongue without the Greek is not understood, so not the Greek without
the Latin can be expounded and taught (or delivered.) Caeterae etiam arts,
quarum modo mentio facta est, cum recreationis, tum vtilitatis et necessitatis
causa, simul caeteris Latin et graece discendi laboribus admiscendae sunt the
other arts also, whereof now mention was made, both for the sake of recreation,
and also of profit and necessity, are to be intermeddled together to the
other labors of learning Greek and Latin. Debent autem illi, qui aetate et
eruditione provectiores sunt, illustres authorum locos, insignes narrationes et
historias, ex graeca lingua in Latinam, et ex latina in graecam vertere but
they which are riper (or forwarder) in age and learning, ought to turn out of
the Greek tongue into the Latin, and out of the Latin into the Greek, the
renouned places of authors, the notable discourses and the histories. Sed
meminerint studiosi, in convertendis e graeca lingua in Latinam, et contra,
scriptis, non semper verbum ex verbo exprimendum esse, sed dandam esse operam,
vt si quid abhorreat a consuetudine et more ejus sermonis, in quem aliquid
convertetur, id omittatur on nino. But students shall remember (or let students
remember) in translating writings out of the Greek tongue into the Latin, and
contrariwise, that not always word is to be translated out of word (or that
they must always translate word for word) but endeavor is to be given, that
if any thing disagreeth from the custom and manner of that speech, whereinto
something shall be translated, it be omitted altogether. Quod a se obseruatu^
in conuertendis orationibus adversarijs Aeschinis et Demosthenis Cicero
affirmat, which thing Cicero affirms to be observed by him self in turning
the adversary orations of Aeschines and Demosthenes. Sic enim in libro de
optimo genere oratorum scribit for so he writes in the book of the best kind
of orators: quorum ego orationes, vt spero, ita expressero, virtutibus vtens
illorum omnibus, id est, sententijs, et earum figuris, et rerum ordine verba
persequens eatenus, vt ea non abhorreant a more nostro. Whose orations I, as I
hope, shall so express (or translate) using all the properties (or virtues) of
them, that is, the sentences, and the figures of them, and the order of the
matters, thoroughly following the words so far, as they be not disagreeing
from our custom. Est igitur Ciceronis de verbis conuertendis sententia, ea
persequenda esse duntaxat, quae a more illorum in quorum linguam vsu inque
conuertentur, non abhorrebunt. It is therefore the opinion of Cicero concerning
translating words, that those things are only to befollowed, which disagree
not from the manner (or custom) of them, in whose language and use they shall
be translated. Vt autem studiosi graecarum literarum optimum exemplar habeant,
quod in conuertendis conjungendisque graecis cum latinis imitentur. But that
the students of the greek language may have a very good pattern, which they may
imitate in tranflating and conioyning (or comparing) greek with latin, cum
alios ex apologia, phaedone phaedro, libris de legibus, et de republica
Platonis locos, a Cicerone latin redditos, tum librum Ciceronis de
vniuersitate, cum ea part Timei Platonis, cui respondet, diligenter et attente
inter se conjungent, conferent, et cum primum aliquid scire graece caeperint,
ad imitandum sedulo sibi proponent, both some places out of the apology, the
phaedon, the phaedrus, the books of the laws and of the commonwealth of
Plato, rendered in latin by Cicero, also the book of Cicero concerning
university, with that part of Timaeus of Plato, whereto it answers,
diligently and attentively they shall set together between themselves, shall
compare (or confer) and as soon as they shall begin to know any thing in
greek, they shall prefixe before them to be imitated of themselves diligently;
quod si fecerint, non modo elegans dicendi genus, quod apud Ciceronem perpetuum
est, descent, sibique comparabant: fed etiam graeca facilius intelligent, et
discit us explicabunt, which if they will do, they shall learn, and get to
themselves, not only the elegant kind of speaking, which is continual in
Cicero; but also more easily they shall understand, and more expressly (or
elegantly) shall expound the greek (writings.) Sed forte objiciet aliquis, and
esse and fuisse nonnullos, qui sero admodum, cum quidem aetate prouecti essent
primum literas discere caeperint, and tamen illos in vtraque lingua praeclaros
progressus fecisse, but peradventure some one will object, that there are and
have been certain, which very late, when as truly they were run far in age
(or years) at the first began to learn good letters (or language) and yet
notwithstanding that they made excellent progresses in both tongues. Fateor
esse ingenia quaedam eximia atque illustria, quae celeriter quod docetur,
arripiant, and brevi tempore mulcum proficiant, I confess that there are some
singular and clear (or renowned) wits, which quickly learn that which is
taught, and profit much in a short time. Sed hoc adjungo, vt horum exempla
confirmant dicta to eroti panta perasima amori omnia per via sunt: item, dia
carterias kai philoponias ouden ton onton agathon analoton pephuke tolerantia
and industria nihil in rerum natura bonorum est, quin acquiratur: item labor
omnia vincit improbus, sic nemo illis exemplis ad excusandam ignaviam suam, and
negligendam discendi occasionem, abuti debet. Non enim cuiuis contingit adiri
co^inthum. But this I add, as sayings do confirm the examples of these, all
things are passeable (or open, or have a way through) to (or for) love. And
also there is nothing of the good things in the nature of things, but it may be
achieved by enduring (or sufferance) and industry. (Ouden nothing ton onton
agathon of the exi^ent (or being) good things pephuke has been brought forth
analoton vnattaineable dia carterias through through patience (or enduring) kai
philoponias and industry.) And likewise importunate (or great, labor
overcomes all things. So no body ought to abuse th^se examples to excuse his
slothfulness, and to neglect the opportunity of learning: for it happens not
to every one to go unto Corinthu^. Ac quemadmodum heroica facta sunt supra
regulam, et mediocres homines intra metas regulae m^^ere debent: ita nemo
d^b^t, temere talia praestantium hominum, quibus per fortunam vel alias causas,
citius literas attingere non licuit, exempla imitari, et occasionem, ^i quae
datu^ in pueritia discendi literas et linguas, negligere, maxim cum ars sit
longa, vita autem breuis, vt verissime Hippocrates initio suorum aphorismorum
inquit. And even as her^icall (or noble men's) deeds are above rule, and mean
men ought to abide* ^thin the bounds of rule. So no man ought rashly to imitate
such examples of excelleni men, to whom through fortune or other causes, it was
not possible to attain learninig sooner, and to neglect the occasion, if any
be given in childhood to learn letters and languages; especially seeing that
art is long, and life short, as most truly says Hippocrates in the beginning
of his aphorisms. Quid? quod natura ipsa sic hominis vitam dispertiuit, vt
prima aetas linguae, media eloquentiae, postrema vsui et communi vtilitati
tribueretur: quam si tanquam ducem sapientissimum sequemur, puer ab
incunabulis, ^sque ad annum decimum quartum aut decimum sextum, ^linguis et
politioribus literis informandus erit. What? (or why, or do you ask me why?)
because nature it self has so divided the life of man, that the first age
should be applied to language, the middl^ to eloquence, the last to use and
common profit: whom if we will follow as the most wise guide, a boy from the
cradle (from infancy) even until the fourteenth or sixteenth year, shall be
to be instructed in languages and in the more exquisite learning. Ita poterit
postea et studia suscipere et tractare quae ipsi emolumentum et honorem,
ecclesiae vero et reipublicae vtilitatem immensam pariant. So shall he be
able afterward to undertake and handle those studies, which may bring commodity
and honor to himself, and exceeding great profit to Church and common wealth.
Sed dolendum est, hunc ordinem a natura praescriptum, et omnium sanorum hominum
judicio approbatum, multis modis turbari, but it is to be sorrowed, that this
order prescribed by nature, and approved by the judgment of all sound men, is
confounded in many manners. Nam vel prae^ptores sieve ignorantia, sieve ignauia,
saepe iustum instituendi ordinem non servant, vel adolescentes sine pennis, vt
in prouerbio est, volare volunt, et neglectis linguis ac humanioribus
disciplinis, ad superiores arts, theologiam, iuris prudentiam, vel artem
medicam se conferunt: vel praepostero ordine incedentes, in linguarum studijs,
sine suo et aliorum hominum fructu consenescunt. For either masters, whether
through ignorance, or through slothfulness, oftentimes keep not the just
order of teaching, or youths will fly without wings, as it is in the proverb,
and languages, and the liberaller learnings being neglected, they betake them
unto the superior arts, divinity, knowledge of the law, or the physical art:
or going in a preposterous order, do wax old (or spend all the time) in the
study of tongues, without their own and the fruit of other men. Quod ne fiat,
magistri periti et ad docendum idonei, liberalibus stipendijs conducendi, and
scholis praeficiendi sunt; ex quibus, qui puro ornatoque sermon, superiora
studia illustrare, exornare, and propagare possint, emittantur: quod, vt ego
quidem arbitror, recte et commode fieri poterit, si implorato Dei auxilio, sine
quo irrita est omnis humana industria, ordo, qui vtcunque a me hac breui
oratione delineatus est, in docendo et discendo seruabitur. Least the which be
done (or that the which be not d^ne) skillful masters and fit to teach are to
be hired with liberal stipends, and to be set over the schools; out of which
they may be sent forth, which are able to illustrate, adorn and propagate the
superior studies, with a pure and an elegant ^^ile (or speech) which a^ I
truly do think, will be done rightly and profitably, if Gods help being
beseeched, without which al man's industry is of none effect, the order shall be
kept in teaching and learning, which is pourtrayed (or described) by me in this
short oration after a sort. Haec habui quae de lingua latina et graeca discenda
et docenda, hoc tempore dicerem, quae e^si non omnibus placebunt, vt nec
placere debent, vel possunt, (quis enim omnibus satisfacere potest?) tamen
viris doctis, et vsu peritis ac judicio certo rem ponderantibus omnino probatum
iri co^fido Dixi. These things I have had, which I would say at this time,
concerning learning and teaching the latin and greek tongue, which things
although they will not please all, as neither ought they to please, or can (for
who can satisfy all men?) yet notwithstanding I am sure that they will be
approved altogether of men learned and by experience skillful, and pondering
the matter with the firm (or sound) judgment. I have said.

FINIS.
The use of this Book.
YOU are to have the book called Posselij Colloquia, and to confer this
book therewith. And in this book you shall see every Latin word thereof
englished, and also the Latin words thereof so taken (or placed) one after
another, as they are to be construed or englished. And you may at the first by
help of this construing book learn to english so many Latin words, as do
in Posselius reach to a full point. And then looking only on Posselius to
endeavor to construe them according as this book has them construed, and so
to learn to construe all Posselius. In the latter part whereof there are more
Latin words than one construed together; because some of the words there, are
in the forepart of the book with their english next after them; which you
remembering, you will be able to discern which words of the English are the
English of such words, as you have not read before: and so notwithstanding you
will know how to apply each English word unto each Latin word, and be able to
english every Latin word thereof severally. And hereby also you will be
exercised how for to vndetstand Authors, whose translation is not word for
word, as it is in the Latin. Unto the true pronouncing of the words of
Posselius, you are to remember that such syllables, as have the note over them,
are to be uttered short: and such as have the note are to be uttered long. Also
a words last syllable saving one, ending in a vowell, is short, if the next
namely the last syllable does begin with a vowell: as familiarium not
familiarium. But if a words last syllable saving one does end in a consonant,
and the last syllable thereof does begin with a consonant, then is the last
syllable saving one, long: as libellus not libellus. And remembering to observe
these rules in reading, you will rightly pronounce even every word of the
book. When as you are able to english readily any word or sentence of
Posselius, according as this construing book shows, not looking then on this
book, you will be able with help of an English Bible for to construe much in
the Latin Bible of Ieromes translation. And therein you are first to learn to
construe Saint John's Gospel and epistles, and then to read all the rest of
the new Testament, beginning where you will. And then to exercise in the old
Testament, and to read it through, and you being able readily to english all
the latin Bible; you will be able then to english most Latin in most books
at the first sight. But as you read along in the new Testament or old, it is
profitable for you to learn sometimes between while for to construe in the
authorized Latin grammar, so much as the construing book thereof has
construed to your hand; and also Figura of that grammar, according as it is
construed by M. Stockwood. And then
