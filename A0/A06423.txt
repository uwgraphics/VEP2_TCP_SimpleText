Menippus. Nay sir I was not deed
But the hell alive me receyuyd.

Philonides. What caused the to take the way
Of this incredeble and new Journey.

Menippus. Exam^. Youth thereto did me
Provoke and also the boldness.
Pent. Which for the youth always
Stronger it is in effect.

Philonides. O thou tragidian I pray the heartily
Stand still and leave thy versyfyeng
Speak and show me open and plainly
What was the cause of thy strange clothyng
And of thy Journey to hell descendyng
Sith it is another merry Journey
Another plesaunt nor delectable way.
Escape from hell by no manner way

Philonides. What say / is there any decrees made in hell
For the actis of us that in yerth dwell

Menippus. Ye by god and that many which to be told
Ought not nor the secretis / opened to be
Lest perhappis some men us accuse would
To the Judge Rathama^thum of iniquite

Philonides. No no by god Menippe do not hardely
Dysdayn to thy friend this matter to tell
For to a wise man secret and specially
In holy orders thou may she wit well

Menippus. Certes thou requyrest me straytly

And like young chyldern also waylyng loud
A while then there in the flood we rowd
And after that we came into a wood
