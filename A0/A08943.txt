A brief description of the triumphant show made by the Right Honorable
Aulgernon Percie, Earl of Northumberland, At his Installation and Initiation
into the Princely Fraternity of the Garter, upon the 13. of May, 1635.
To the tune of Quell the pride, etc.


YOu noble Buds of Britain,
that spring from Honors Tree,
Who love to hear of high designs,
attend a while to me,
And I Will (in brief) discover what
Fame bids me take in hand,
to blaze
the praise
Of great Northumberland.
The Order of the Garter,
ere since third Edwards Reigned,
Unto the Realm of England has
a matchless Honor gaind:
The World has no Society
like to this Princely band,
to raise
the praise
Of great Northumberland.
The honor of his Pedigree
does claim a high regard,
And many of his Ancestors,
for Fame thought nothing hard,
And he through noble qualities,
which are exactly scand,
does raise
the praise
Of Great Northumberland.
Against the day appointed,
his Lordship did prevare,
To publish his Magnificence,
no charges he did spare,

The like within man's memory,
was never tune in hand,
to raise
the praise
Of great Northumberland.
Upon that day it seemed,
all Britany did strive,
And did their best to honor him,
with all they could coutriue,
For all our high Nobility
joined in a mutual hand,
to blaze,
they praise,
Of great Northumberland.
The Common eyes were dazeled,
With wonder to behold,
The luster of apparel rich,
all Silver Pearl and Gold
Which on brave Coursers mounted,
did glister through the Strand.
to blaze
tho praise,
Of great Northumberland.
But are that I proceeded,
this progress to report
I should have mentioned the feast,
made at Salisbury Court,
Almost sieve hundred dishes,
did on a table stand,
to raise
the praise,
Of great Northumberland.
The second part to the same tune.


THe mightyest Prince or Monarch,
that in the world does reign,
At such a sumptuous banquet might,
have dined without disdain.
Where Sack like Conduit water
was free even at command.
to blaze
the praise
Of great Northumberland.
The famous Fleet Street Conduit,
renowned so long ago.
Did not neglect to express what love,
she to my Lord did owe
For like an old proud woman
she painted fair both stand.
to blaze,
the praise,
Of great Northumberland.
A number of brave Gallants,
some Knights and some Esquires,
Attended at this triumph great,
clad in complete attyres.
The Silver half moon gloriousse,
upon their sleeves did stand,
to blaze
the praise,
Of great Northumberland.
All these on stately, Horses,
that til endured the bit,
Wear mounted in magniffique sort,
as to the time was fit,
Their feathers white and red dit show,
like to a martial band,
to blaze
the praise,
Of great Northumberland.
The noble Earls and Vizco^tz,
and Barons rode in state,
This great and high solemnity,
all did Congratulats,
To honor brave Earl Pearcy,
each put a helping hand,
to blaze
the praise,
Of great Northumberland.
King Charles our Royal sovereign
and his renowned Mary,
With ( Britains hope) their progeny.
all lovingly did tarry.
At noble Vizcount Wimbletons,
^ith fairest part 'oth Strand,
to blaze, etc.
To famous Winsor-Castle,
with all his gallant train,
Earl Pearcy went that afternoon,
his honor to obtain.
And there he was installed,
One of Saint Georges band,
to blaze, etc.
Long may he live in honor,
in plenty and in peace,
For him and all his noble friends,
to pray I Will never cease,
This ditty (which I now will end)
was only fane in hand.
to blaze
the praise,
Of great Northumberland.
