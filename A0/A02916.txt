TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, and virtuous Lady, the Lady ANNE, Countess of
OXENFORD: much honor, with increase of godliness and virtue. *
ALL THE government, (Right Honorable) of the true, holy, and Catholic
Church, which has been from the creation of the world, until this present age
is comprehended in five orders or degrees: the first of the Fathers, beginning
at Adam, etc: the second of the Patriarchs, beginning at Abraham: the third of
the Prophets, beginning at Samuel: the fourth of the high Priests, beginning at
Iehoshua, otherwise called Jesus: the fifth and last of the Apostles, beginning
at Saint John Baptist.

Among all which Apostles, none was more wonderfully called to the preaching
of the Gospel, than S. Paul, who being a bold and common blasphemer, a
bloody and merciless persecuter, afflicting the flock of Christ with most
terrible torments, was notwithstanding even in the fire of his fury reclaimed,
and became the great teacher of the Gentiles, delivering unto them such
heavenly doctrine, as he received by divine inspiration, apt to instruct,
exhort, rebuke, correct, and reform, that the man of God might be made perfect
in all good works.

This Apostle, as before the time of his conversion, which was in the very
year of Christ's ascension, he shed much innocent blood, making havoc of the
members of the Church, with the sword of persecution: so after the renouncing
of his apostaticall tyranny, he saved many thousand souls, by the preaching
of the Gospel, and word of reconciliation.

For he taught the truth of the eternal God, whose minister and vessel of
election he was, ordained to set forth his glory before the face of the
mighty, instantly, in season and out of season, by the space of thirty six
years, to many nations, profoundly and zealouslie, beginning in the
nineteenth year of Tiberius at Damasco: continuing it through out a great part
of the world, as appears by his painful peregrination: and finishing that
good work of his, in the thirteenth year of Nero, whose prisoner he was, and
at his commandment put to death in Rome, for the testimony of the truth,
which he sealed with the loss of his life, unto the glory of the great God.

This blessed Apostle Saint Paul, was founder of the Church of Christ at
Ephesus, where he preached the Gospel of peace most sincerely: and instructed
the Ephesians in the necessary doctrines of their salvation, and in the deep
points of true religion: as in predestination and election, in faith and
justification, in prayer and invocation, in grace and adoption, in manners and
conversation, etc. as does manifestly appear in his Epistle, written to this
people out of bonds and imprisonment.

The exposition whereof (Right Honorable) M. Nicholas Hemming, a learned,
godly, and excellent Divine undertaking, and accomplishing, has so orderly
and plainly opened all the principal points therein contained, that nothing can
seem doubtful or difficult, no not to the simple and ignorant: besides that,
so briefly, that the memory of the reader shall be able to carry away both
his method and matter.

Whose work when I had read and perused, I turned familiarlie into our English
tongue, because I saw it was a book very like to be beneficial unto every
private person. And having ended mine honest travel, I remembered (among diverse
favorers of learning, and lovers of godliness) your good Ladyship: whom as I
honor for the same respects, so finding in your Ladyship, among your other
virtues, a zealous love to religion, and to the sincere serving of GOD, (rare
things in the multitude, what then in the honorable?) I have been thereby
induced, and thus boldly have presumed, to prease with this my poor present
unto your Ladyship, in way of dedication: and do pray your favorable
protection of the same. Beseeching, even with humbleness, that this my homely
handeled Expositor, a stranger borne, and newly araied with course English
cloth, may find such favor in your Ladyships presence, as to be interteined.

Not doubting, but the Author for his excellent learning, and profound
knowledge uttered therein, shall thereby be able to withstand all seditious
Scismatikes, quarelling Sycophants, impudent Papists, pestilent Pellagians,
blasphemous Anabaptists, licentious Libertines, whose perilous opinions are by
him confuted: and finally, all the malicious members of Satan that old
serpents synagogue: to the preferring of the truth, and the increase of Gods
glory, unto whose protection I commend your good Ladyship: whose happiness
God grant may be such, both here and above, as your own heart would wish,
and as my continual and daily prayer shall be, Amen.

Your Honorable Ladyships Most humbly to be commanded, Abraham Fleming.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, LEARned, godly, and excellent Divine, M. Henry of
Hertoghenbosch, of the ancient house of the Bruchoffens, Deane of the Chapter
of Lunden in Denmark, and his beloved brother in Christ, NICHOLAS HEMMING
wishes health and welfare.
I Heard (Right Worshipful) upon a time, at the mouth of that good and godly
man, M. Philip Melancthon, that There is no work more excellent, than to teach
and learn the word of God. And it may be so very well. For, without
heavenly doctrine, Ephe. 4. 17. 18.
we proll in most thick darkness and ignorance: or (to use S. Paul's speech)
We walk in the vanity of our mind, we wander through our own blind
understanding, and are far off from the life of God: because our ignorance,
and the hardness of our heart brings to pass, 2. Cor. 7. 10.
that we are touched with no feeling at all of sorrow for our sins: without
which feeling, the voice of the Gospel does never wax sweet unto man: but
rather lie wide open, and give up our selves, to the committing of all
filthiness.

Now, the word of God is a sovereign salve to heal up these sores: when the
same is sincerely taught, and faithfully learned. Which thing that kingly
Prophet David knowing well enough, Psa. 119. 9.
witnesses, saying: In quo mundam, etc. Wherewith shall a young man redress
his way? In taking heed thereto according to thy word: which word
(doubtless) he says in the same Psalm, Psa. 119. 24.
is his delight and counselors. For this cause the same Prophet, Psa. 119. 127.
prefers that very word, before all the riches of the world, saying: Diligo
mandata, etc. I love thy commandments above gold: yea, above most fine gold.
Psa. 119. 162.
Again, Laetabor ego super, etc. I will rejoice at thy words, Psa. 119. 72.
as one that finds a great spoil. Again, Melior mihi lex, etc. The law of
thy mouth is better unto me, than thousands of gold and silver.

David therefore confesses, that the word of God, is the most precious
treasure in the world: and that our life is unclean, and our way filthy,
until they be cleansed by the word of God, as with water of the clearest
fountain. Which thing is then done, when we obtain faith by hearing, and
receive the holy Ghost. For, then the mistiness of our minds is driven
away, our understanding is lightened, and our heart which was hard before like
a stone, is made fleshie and soft: so that the law of God may be written
therein, even to be touched with the feeling of sin, to defy and spit at
sin, and to follow the counsels, not of the flesh, but of the spirit, in
framing and ordering our life. Seeing the doctrine of Gods word brings so
many and great benefits, that notable man (whom even now I named) says, even
upon just cause, that Among all the works of men, to teach and learn the word
of God is the most excellent.

Now, for so much as the word of God is a treasure so pretions, and to teach and
learn the word of God, a work so excellent, what shall we say of the sincere
and true teachers of this word? What shall we say of them, which delivered the
word of God, as it were from destruction, when it lay ouertroden with the
horrible imaginations of men, and devises of devils, as in most filthy mire,
and made the same fair and clean with their sound and sincere expositions? We
are greatly indebted to them, which see to the provision of such necessaries
as belong to the maintenance of this life, and without which these frail
bodies of ours cannot continue in health: but we are never able to requite them
with the like, which have restored and made doctrine pure again, being the
very treasure, without the which we fall from all hope of everlasting life,
and have delivered the same doctrine unto us, both by word of mouth, and in
writing, sound and sincere.

In the number of these I reckon M. Philip Melancthon, M. Philip Melancthon
commended.
our schoolmaster, a man worthy of the first place next under M. Martine
Luther: than whom all Germany never bred and brought up one sharper in wit,
quicker in judgment, perfecter in knowledge, greater in learning, readier and
sounder in expounding the scripture roundly: yea, and more than that,
zealouser in godliness, and earnester in religion* In consideration of which
notable and singular gifts, he is had in great account and estimation, not
only of them which profess the same religion with us: but also of the very
enemies of true religion.

When Saint Paul wrote to the Philippians of his time, Phi. 2. 29.
concerning Epaphroditus, saying: Excipite ipsum in domino, and Receive him in
the Lord, with all gladness, and make much of such: the holy Ghost means
indeed thereby: yea, wills us, to take them for Gods instruments: openly to
confess the benefits which we receive by the means of such men, to be of
God: to reverence them as our schoolemasters: to love them as our fathers: to
esteem of them as the builders up of Gods Church: and to make account of them
as the most principal pillars of Gods Temple. Thus much does godliness
desire: and their travels deserve no less.

We must not therefore give them any place, whose practice it is to devise
slauders, reproaches, and foul speeches, thereby doing what they can, to put
out so great lights of the Church: who, if they seems to have done amiss in
any thing, let us make the best of it, for Christian charity, and meekness
sake. It is a true saying of Xenophon: (...). Which sound thus being
expounded: It is a hard matter for men so to do a thing, that it be amiss in
no point: and it is hard for them also that do a thing in no respect
blameworthy, not to light upon some quareling findfault. For the weakness of
men is great, and many escapes are made in a man's life, which are rather
friendly and favorably to be covered, than maliciously and enuiouslie to be
made worse.

There is also in many a great lightness, which makes men to be sharper
judges against others, that have not offended at all. As for our weakness, let
us lament it: and as for our lightness, (which is the cause that they are
evil thought of, whose labors are greater, and their gifts excellenter,) let
us leave it: giving God thanks, who sends into his Church, for the
edification or building up thereof, such healthful instruments.

And although very great thanks (as meet is) are due to them, which have
found out and made ready the first way: yet notwithstanding, others that have
followed after in their place, and try all the masteries they may, for the
edification or building up of the Church, and the knitting together of the
Saints, are not to be set at naught: but every one in his place is to be
had in account. Acts. 18. 3 and 20. 34
Saint Paul was a worthy and chosen instrument of God, than whom not one of
the Apostles labored more, 2. Cor. 11. 22. 23. 24, etc.
nor spread the Gospel of Christ further. Titus also, who remained in the Isle
of Crete, was lesser than Saint Paul, 1. These. 2. 9. 10.
both in gifts and labors: and also in degree of calling. Here I acknowledge
and give Saint Paul his title, Tit. 1. 5.
to be the great teacher of the Gentiles: and as for Titus, I reverence him
according to his place, who learned at S. Paul's mouth those things, which
afterward he delivered to his hearers.

In like sort, I acknowledge and reverence M. Martine Luther, and M. Philip
Melancthon, as the principal and chiefest teachers that ever Gods Church had
in our age: the like I do also to all, and every one of them in their place,
as the healthful instruments of God in his Church: by whose works I set great
store, and am also right glad, that it was my luck to be of their number,
which acknowledge and reverence M. Mart. Luther, and. M. Philip Melancthon,
their schoolemaisters For, out of the rivers, which they fetched from the
fountains of Israel, I confess my self to have drawn that which I set
abroch, and teach in this University of Coppenhagen, as a minister of the
Gospel of God, and according to the order of my calling.

I despise no man, I think not better of mine own opinions than of other men's
judgments: but I yield and submit my self to the Catholic Church of God, as
my judge: which Church I de^^^re to be, not the Fathers and Mothers of Neptune
counsel: but those that i^boare Augusta confession: that is to say, all such
as hold the Creeds sound and vncorrupt: in what place so ever they be
scattered. I condemn no man, if he disagree from me: so that he overthrow
not the foundation: that is to say, the Creeds.

I acknowledge the weakness of us all, which I both bewail, Psalm. 127. 1.
and beseech God to set to his own hand to the building. Nisi enim Dominus,
etc. For except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. I
allow every ones endeavor, that bestow any pains at all toward the building
of Gods Church: in whose number, although I grant my self to be the very
least: yet notwithstanding, I am of this mind, Mat. 25. 14, etc.
that the talent which God has given me, must not lie hid unoccupied.

And because it is not my seeking, to serve the hearers present only, but
those that are absent also: yea, the whole Church of Christ, I have put some of
mine own writings to the press, caused them to be printed, and sent them
abroad. With like aduisement also, I have published these my notes upon the
Epistle of S. Paul to the Ephesians: being willing to have them come abroad
under your name (Right worshipful:) that some token of my thankfulness to you
wards may be seen, whom it has pleased, not only to stand my good and
sincere friend, all the time that you tarried in this realm: but also to
vouchsafe the bestowing of very many benefits upon me: as for those great
benefits and good deeds, which you have done to our University, and to every
student of the same, I let them pass unspoken. For I know, your worship is of
their number, which had rather do good, (God beholding it,) than to be praised
of men, and to hunt after vain glory at their mouth. For they that do so,
Mat. 6. 1. 2
(...), receive their reward. For they are hirelings which serve for hire, and
not the children of God, which do God service of their own accord.

Well may your worship fare, and I pray you take in good part the gift that I
send, favorably iudgeing of the same, according to your manner: and if any
thing mislike you, let me have understanding thereof. For your judgment rules
me much. Once again I wish you well to fare, with that right honest
Gentlewoman, mistress Anne your wife, who (as I hear say) has increased
your household with a young babe. God grant that it may turn to his glory, and
to yours, and the mothers joy and comfort. I pray you have me commended to M.
Tyco your Bishop, M. Vessele your Chaunter, M. Balthazar your Archdeacon, M.
Magnus your divinity reader, M. John Spandemager, who has taken great pains,
these thirty years and more in the Lords vineyard: and all my other brethren,
my fellow laborers.

FINIS.
The Argument upon the Epistle of the Apostle Saint Paul to the Ephesians.
THat we may the more fully perceive and understand the argument of this most
holy Epistle, written to the Ephesians, out of the prison at Rome: we must
make declaration of those four points, which I am wont to touch in the
beginning of mine expositions upon the holy Scriptures.

The four points are these.

First, Who was the Author of this Epistle. For to know this, makes very much
for the winning of worthiness, and authority to this Epistle.

Secondly, What was the occasion why the same was written. For the marking
hereof, makes very much, both to understand the perfect discourse of the
whole matter, and also to declare the order of the questions.

Thirdly, What is the state or principal question, whereby the kind of the
cause is known: and the end or scope of him which speaks is understood.

Fourthly, What is the order of handling: which being not understood, the
weight and importance of things cannot be observed. To conclude, it often
times falls out, that the method or manner of speaking being not marked,
circumstances contrary and beside the meaning of the writer, are heaped up
together, and many things are wrested of heretics, for the confirmation of
their wicked and erroneous opinions: as is to be seen in their writings, who in
judging, use not the rule of Logic: but handle all and every several part or
parcel, as it were members plucked off from the body.

Of these four points therefore we will orderly entreat, to the intent that we
may the more easily attain to the understanding of this divine Epistle.

Of the first.
THe Author of this Epistle is the Apostle Paul, that great Doctor or teacher
of the Gentiles: who, as he was called to the office and ministry of an
Apostle, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, so was he instructed and taught the
mystery of salvation, by the same Jesus Christ. This Apostle, like a valiant
soldier of Christ, being adorned and decked with souldierlike ensigns and
arms of the field, to wit, with sundry sorts of tribulations and persecutions,
2. Cor. 11. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28.
with whippings, stonings, buffetings, reuilings, etc. by the space of five and
thirty years almost, wrote this Epistle in Prison at Rome to ye Ephesians,
drawing to an end of his life. For So Much therefore as the Author of this
Epistle, is a man of such account, it is not lawful to call in doubt, either
the weightinesse of the matter, or the authority of the writer. Wherefore,
whatsoever things are delivered unto us in this Epistle, we ought no less to
reverence and consider, than the very things themselves, which God by his own
mouth has uttered and spoken from Heaven. And therefore, as the doctrine
contained in this Epistle, is (...): that is to say, by inspiration from God:
so has it very great weight and force to confirm the articles of our
religion, and to confute errors, and that in such sort, as that no man,
unless he be altogether godless, and a professed or sworn enemy to Christ,
will set himself against the worthiness and authority of this most holy
Epistle. Many more things, touching this our Apostle, may be read in the Acts
of the Apostles, and in his own Epistles to the Galathians, the Corinthians,
and others.

Of the second.
AN offense taken at the cross, ministered an occasion to the Apostle, of
writing this Epistle. For at such time as Paul, having finished his course of
preaching, was cast into prison at Rome, and that the godly every where were
afflicted, not only by Tyrants, but also of false Apostles: he thought it a
part of his charge and calling, to confirm the Ephesians, by writing to them,
whom because of his absence, he could not teach: least that, either for his
own cross, or for the persecutions of the Church, which at that time were
exceeding great, they should fall from that grace, whereof they were made
partakers by the preaching of the Gospel. As therefore the offense of the
cross, moved this most holy Apostle of Christ to write: so the end of his
writing was, to arm the Ephesians, that they might inuincibly stand, and
persist in that doctrine of Christ, which they had learned of him.

Of the third.
BEcause the special part of this Epistle consists in exposition, the full
scope thereof does less show it self, than if it were reasoned and disputed
upon: which notwithstanding shall easily be atteined, when the end of his
writing is perceived. Out of the first, second and third Chapters therefore is
this principal scope or sum gathered: namely, That the doctrine concerning
the grace of God, and his mercy through Jesus Christ, is no newly vpstart
doctrine, neither belongs to one sort or sect of men only: but that the
same, even from before the world was created, until this day, was in such
order stablished by God himself, yt so many should be saved in Christ, as
believed in him, Romans 1. 16
not only Jews, but also Gentiles, among whom were the Ephesians. This scope
or sum is declared in a large exposition, and trimly set out or decked with
weighty words and sentences: and this is done in the three first Chapters.
Hereby most evidently apeareth, how necessary the doctrine is, which is
delivered in this Epistle. In the three last Chapters, diverse exhortations are
interlaced, and duties also, as well common to all estates, as peculiar to
some, are commended to the godly.

Of the fourth.
THe occasion, the full scope or sum, and the end, why this Epistle was
written, being known, the order or method of handling the same, may the more
easily be declared, and also understood. There are (besides the title, the
greeting, and the knitting up or farewell of this Epistle) two principal
parts, namely, (...), and (...), that is to say, Doctrine and Exhortation:
whereof doctrine is by nature the first, and exhortation the second by order.
For this is the perpetual order of Moses, of the Prophets, of Christ, of the
Apostles, and of all such as teach aright: that upon doctrine, which they
deliver in the first place, they frame and bring in their admonitions, their
exhortations, their comminations or threatenings, their reprehensions or
rebukings, their consolations, etc. For so do they apply their doctrine to
the hearers. And surely, a small matter it is to teach well, except therwithall
thou stir up the slothful with certain pricks, except thou refresh and
comfort the fearful, except thou rebuke and chide the stubburne and wilful,
etc.

Furthermore, the former part, which is called (...), Doctrine, is not (...):
that is to say, stands not upon disputation or reasoning: but (...), that is
to say, consists in exposition. For it contains an exposition of the mystery
of our salvation, and that first in general, toward all the elect or chosen,
declaring, that it is not a new mystery of salvation, but in such sort
ordained and established, before the creation of the world, by the mere
goodness of our heavenly Father, that he would save all believers, in his
beloved son. Then he divides the generality, and applies the same to the
specialties: showing, That the benefit of reconciliation or atonement, does
indifferently belong to the Jews and to the Gentiles, among whom were the
Ephesians. And as Rhetoricians teach, what is to be observed in the exposition
of things, so he beats in more deeply the causes and the circumstances. For
he sets down most diligently, the causes efficient, material, formal and
final of this mystery, making a repetition of the self same things yet
again, both that a desire of this so great a mystery, might be kindled the
more in the minds of the Ephesians: and also that they might not (for any
causes whatsoever) fall from so great grace. Heerevpon also it arises, that he
says, he gives God thanks, for that he has vouchsafed to reveal his
mystery of the salvation of mankind, to the Ephesians: and that he witnesses
likewise, that he praide unto God for the Ephesians, that they might profit
daily more and more, in the knowledge of this mystery.

Now, that he might persuade the Ephesians, that salvation freely given, does
also pertain to them, he shows how he himself was called and taught, by the
revelation of Jesus Christ, to preach the Gospel or glad tidings of salvation
freely given, not to the Jews only but to the Gentiles also, the difference
between the Jews and the Gentiles being taken away by the coming of Christ:
so that salvation freely given, is indifferently, and without respect, offered
to the Gentiles, and to the Jews: faith being the instrument whereby it is
received.

Hitherto have we touched the former part of this Epistle, which he knitteth up
and ends with a thanksgiving, according to his usual manner.

Here let the Readers diligently mark, how fitly all things are applied to
the scope and end of his writing. If grace be powered out so plentifully upon
all men: if the mystery of salvation decreed, and purposed before the creation
of the world, be preached: if in his beloved son he loves the believers: if
he seal salvation and grace by his spirit: if he send Apostles and
Ambassadors with grace of this mystery: if it be a gift and benefit freely
given: if by the preaching of this benefit the praise and glory of God is
testified: to be short, if the holiness and salvation of men be sought: what
man or woman, unless they be wodde and witless, contemners and despisers of
their own salvation, but will confess that it is meruellous necessary to
stand sledfastly in this doctrine, and with a valiant and invincible mind and
courage, to suffer rather any torments, than to fall from so great grace and
salvation.

The latter part which stands upon exhortation, is diverse and manifold. For
in this the Apostle exhorts first of all to the unity of spirit in love and
charity: then he goes to common duties, as it were to ye specialties of the
generality. Then, by reasons repugnant and contrary to our vocation or
calling, he weaneth and withdraws us from vices, and declares (by
comparison) what the godly ought to do. Hereunto he adds precepts concerning
domestical discipline, or household government. For he inioineth husbands and
wives, parents and children, masters and servant, (...) officia sib^ inuicem
reddere, that is to say, to use semblaunt and proportionable duties one toward
and other: all which he draws out of the fountain of faith and love,
applieng to each severally that which to them is convenient. After this he
makes up the panoplie or warlike furniture of Christian soldiers, and
therwithall he armeth the Ephesians, against Satan the enemy of man's
salvation: unto this part be ioineth are quest, that the Ephesians would pray
for him. Lastly, he makes mention of Tychicus, whom he sent unto them with
this Epistle, of whom (as he certifieth them) they might know his estate: and
so at the length, with a well wishing unto them, according to his custom, he
makes en end. Let this be sufficient to be spoken of the order and method of
handling this Epistle. Now, in the explication or expounding of every several
Chapter. I will (after my manner) keep this order. First, I will gather and
draw every several Chapter to a certain summarie or head Secondly, and will
set down the order and parts of every several Chapter. Thirdly and lastly, I
will add an exposition, and an observation of such doctrines as we shall
meet, with an applieng of them to our use and practice. The first brings
this benefit, that whatsoever is Rhetorically spoken, the same being examined
summarily by Logic, may the more easily be understood, and in few words or
short speech once conceived, may stick the faster in memory. The second,
which is the middlemost, does help as well the interpreter or teacher, as also
ye learners or scholars. It helps the interpreter or teacher, least he,
forgetting those things whereof special consideration should be had, might
break out into straieng opinions, nothing belonging to the Authors meaning:
which thing in sequel ingendreth many corruptions, diversity of opinions,
unprofitable disputations, sects and heresies. It helps ye learners or
scholars, because they (besides observation and marking of the order, than the
which nothing is more handsome and commendable) man the more narrowly see into
ye pith and substance of things whereby judgment is formed in the learners, to
the end yt they in other writings may observe and mark the phrase and manner
of speech. The last examineth the order of things, brings light to that which
is hidden and dark, vntieth yt which is entangled and snarled, and shows the
use of those things, which are declared in our life: by which means it comes
to pass (as the Apostle says) that out of the Scriptures we draw knowledge,
comfort, patience, and hope.

THE FIRST CHAPTER.
The sum of the first Chapter.
AS God reuealeth ye mystery of salvation by his gospel unto them, who^
(according to his good will and pleasure) he has chosen in his beloved son,
for the praise of his glory: so he seals them with his spirit: and Paul
testifies yt the Ephesians are in ye number. Wherefore he gives God thanks
for them, and prays that they might more and more abound.

The order and parts of the Chapter.
THe order of the Chapter is this. After the inscription or title, and the
desire or wish, follows in the first place a thanksgiving, a reason being
taken from the manifold blessing and grace of God, most liberally powered
forth upon all mankind. Hereunto is added a notable exposition of this grace
of God toward all mankind, and that altogether Rhetorical. For first of all
he sets out and commends this grace of God toward mankind: and by
reasons drawn from the Causes and Effects he amplifieth and inlargeth it. Then
he goes from the generality unto two specialities: and this partaking of
grace he applies first to the Jews, and secondly to the Gentiles, but under
the name of the Ephesians. Moreover, to the end that the Ephesians might
acknowledge the greatness of this grace, and think upon perseueraunce or
constancy, he says that he gives God thanks for revealing unto them the
mystery of salvation, and that he prays unto God, that they may increase and
abound therein more and more. From whence he falls again into the setting
forth and commending of Gods benefits.

The exposition of the first Chapter, with the observation of doctrines therein
contained.
1. Verse.
PAVLE an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the Saints which are
at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. PAVLE an Apostle of Jesus
Christ by the will of God. To the Saints which are at Ephesus, and to them
which believe in Jesus Christ. THere are two parts of this inscription or
title, the first whereof contains three things, to wit. The proper name of
the person which writes. The worthiness of his office, and the authority of
his function Apostolical. Heerevpon we may gather first of all, what account
is to be made of the doctrine of the Apostle, who was made an Apostle of Jesus
Christ, by the will of God. Secondly, we may learn hereby in general, not
only what the authority of Ministers is, which bring Paul's doctrine: but
also what manner confession of their function and calling is required. We must
conclude upon both, that we must not give place to assemblies of men sitting in
council, or to the authority of any man or men, if they command or bring in
any thing contrary or against this doctrine of the Apostle. For it is not
meet that the authority and vioce of God should give place to the traditions,
or to the superiority of men or devils. To this agrees that saying of Saint
Paul to the Galathians. If an Angel from Heaven preach otherwise than we have
preached, let him be accursed.

The second part of the inscription or title, does not only name them, unto
whom the Apostle writes, to wit, the Ephesians: but also adorneth and
beautifieth them with most excellent titles, whilst it calls them by the name
of Saints and Faithful. Which two names are so jointly linked together by
nature, that of whom so ever the one is spoken, the other also is most truly
meant and uttered. For they cannot be separated either from other: because, who
so ever is faithful is a Saint: and who so ever is a Saint is faithful.
Whosoever believes truly is holy: and again, every one that is holy does
believe.

Now, we are made Saints, or holy by this means. The faith of the Gospel does
separate us from the unholiness of the world, and brings us unto ye family
or householde of God: by this self same faith we are purified and made clean.
For whosoever believes in Christ, is both purged and also healed by his blood.
Furthermore, by this self same faith we are presented before God, that we
might be a lively sacrifice, pleasing God thorough Jesus Christ. Whosoever
therefore is separated from the unholiness of the world, is purified by the
blood of Christ, and is slain to be a lively sacrifice unto God, through Jesus
Christ, the same is a Saint and holy in deed, notwithstanding he perceive in
himself certain spots and blemishes, which he does what he can to wash away
and avoid.

This place does show, as well what things are joined to a true faith: as also
that the faithful is reputed a Saint or holy one before God, even by the
judgment of the holy Ghost. The words of Chrysostom in this place are
excellent. Lo (says he) Saint Paul calls such men Saints, as had wives,
children, and an householde. For afterward follows the proper terms whereby
he terms them, to wit, Husbands, wives, masters and servant, and to them
he commends mutual duties. By this terming of them Saints therefore, ye
pestilent error of Monks is confuted, who put sanctity or holiness in single
life, and in fained or dissembled virginity. Unto these also I add, that they
likewise are confuted by this place, who bragged and boasted of a precise
choice of poverty, as of the perfection and fulness of Christian holiness. For
among the Ephesians, were many saithfull persons, which did abound in riches
and wealth: yet they, notwithstanding their conversion by the preaching of
Paul, cast not away their riches, or set their substance at naught.

Grace be with you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus
Christ. Grace be with you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
Jesus Christ. THis desire or well wishing of the Apostle, comprehends a
summarie of the benefits of the Gospel. First he wishes unto the Ephesians
Gods grace: which signifies unto us, as well the free good will of God, as
also every gift whatsoever is given us of God. Secondly he wishes peace unto
them, that is to say, reconciliation or atonement of our selves with God: he
wishes likewise unto them such things as are joined with this reconciliation:
namely, the joy of spirit, and a quiet conscience.

Now, from whence this grace and peace proceeds, and by whom we possess
them, the Apostle declares, when he says ( From God our Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ.) From God the Father, as from the beginning and fountain:
and from ye Lord Jesus Christ, as from ye Mediator. For as the Father is the
fountain of all graces: so the son is both the matter and merit of all grace
and peace. Here therefore, even in the very entrance of this Epistle, all
merits of men, and all dreams of Monks, touching their traditions, all their
Merita congrui, digni and condig^^: that is, of congruitie and worthiness,
etc. are put to silence. For so often as grace is preached so often are the
merits of men overthrown and condemned. For how can that be of merit, which is
of grace? For that saying of the holy Ghost stands vnremouable, Si ex
gratia, non amplius ex operibus: Romans 11. 6
alioqui gratia non est gratia, etc. If it be of grace, it is no more of works,
or else were grace no more grace. But if it be of works, it is no more grace,
or else were work no more work. The Apostle, in this place does so oppose and
set grace and work one against the other, that both of them can by no means
be attributed to one self same third thing, neither yet the one ascribed to
the other.

Moreover, this well wishing does teach us, that we can obtain no good thing
at Gods hand, but that which proceeds from God, by and through our Lord
Jesus Christ. Saint Paul therefore sends us to the Well head of all
goodness, and there withal requires faith, which is the bucket, whereby we
draw all goodness out of this Well head. For as the foundation of this grace
and peace, is the good will of God, and his fatherly love, in having compassion
of man: so man is the mark or end whereunto this foundation is referred, but
yet by faith. For faith is the instrument, whereby this grace and
reconciliation offered unto us, is received, and possessed.

3. Verse.
Blessed be God, even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be God the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. THe apostle begins with thanksgiving: which
tends hereunto, even to admonish us of our duty. For it is not convenient,
that we should lightly pass over and let slip any grace of God, without
praising and magnifieng his name for the same.

The word ( Blessing) which Saint Paul uses in this place has not a simple
signification, but varieth in consideration of that whereunto it is applied:
for God blesses man, man blesses God, and man blesses man: howbeit diverse
and differing ways. When God is said to bless man, ye meaning is, That God in
speaking the word, prospers and deals well with him. For the word of God
is his work: and what he says, is done. Man is said to bless God, when with
a true faith he praises and glorifieth God for his benefits, through Jesus
Christ, and that with the heart, and outward confession of the mouth. That this
is so, it is evident: because the Scripture uses these words, (...), and
(...) (well wishing, and blessing) indifferently, the one for the other. Man is
said to bless man, when he wishes him prosperity, and prays that all
things may go well with him.

Furthermore, the priestlie blessing is not to be supposed the blessing of man
only, but rather of God: in which blessing the commandment and the promise
is to be marked. The commandment is this: Benedicetis, etc. (Thus shall you
bless the children of Israel ( says the Lord) and say unto them: Number. 6. 23
The Lord bless thee and keep thee, The Lord make his face shine upon thee,
and be merciful unto thee, The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and
give thee peace.) The promise is this: Inuocabunt Sacerdotes, etc. The Priests
shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.) This
promise is to be received by faith, and it staieth upon the merit of Christ,
in whom all the promises of God are, yea, and Amen.

3. Verse.
Who has blessed us with all spiritual blessing, in heavenly things in
Christ. Which has blessed us with all manner of spiritual blessing in
heavenly things by Christ. THis is the reason of his thanksgiving, wherein he
comprehends very great things in singular shortness. For first of all he
sets forth the fountain and Author of all blessing, that is to say, of all
prosperity: namely, God the Father, who of his fatherly good will blesses us.
Secondly, he gives us a sight of the object: to wit, man, upon whom God has
powered his blessing most liberally. Thirdly, he declares the peculiar
blessing, which is handled in this place, to be spiritual grace, whereby we
are adopted, and made heirs of everlasting life. Fourthly, he shows that
this peculiar and excellent blessing is not to be sought for in the world, but
in heaven: and that it is begun first here, but there ended and made perfect.
Fifthly and lastly, he adds the matter of this spiritual blessing. For Christ
is the matter and merit of the same.

Mark how many and how heavenly things the Apostle knitteth up in a very few
words. As the first and the second point teach us, that God is the Fountain of
all good: so they beat down and keep under all arrogancy, and pride of man.
The third point teaches us, that the benefits of the Gospel are spiritual. The
fourth sends us to heaven by faith, where the treasure of all blessing is
laid up in Christ. The fifth and last overthrows mightily all merits of men.
For the merit of this heavenly blessing is in none other, but in Christ alone.

4. Verse.
As he has chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we
should be holy and without blame before him. According as he has chosen us
in him before the creation of the world, that we should be Saints and
unreprovable before him in love. THis is a reason of that which the Apostle
said before. For as in the last verse he set down a reason, why we are bound
by duty, to extol the goodness of God: to wit, because he has most
liberally powered his spiritual blessing upon us, whereby he has blessed us
in Christ: so here is annered a reason of that reason, by exposition. Wherein,
as he comprehends the foundation and matter of that heavenly grace or
spiritual blessing: so likewise he shuts up, as it were in a very brief
Aphorism, the time and last end of the same: to the intent that this mystery
might the more manifestly appear before our eyes.

The foundation of our spiritual blessing, or heavenly grace, or of our
salvation, the Apostle makes Gods eternal election, whereby he vouchsafed to
choose such as should believe in him, before the creation of the world.

The matter thereof is Christ. For in him only heavenly grace does rest:
yea, our life and salvation is in him. Here we must take very great heed,
that we separate not election from his proper matter. For we must not dream of
any election without Christ. God has not chosen us simply, but in Christ,
that is to say, as members of Christ, knit by faith unto Christ our head. He
says that this election in Christ, was therefore wrought before the world was
made: least the Ephesians should think, that this Gospel or doctrine of
obteining salvation by Christ, was preached by Paul at hap hazard or
adventures, as a doctrine but lately hatched: but that they might rather know,
that it was the eternal counsel or purpose of God, to give salvation to all
that believe in Christ.

The last end of this heavenly blessing is added, to wit, ( That we should be
holy, and without blame before him in love,) which is the fountain of all
other christian duties. This high and excellent calling therefore does require
holiness and innocence of life, as the last end or effect of spiritual
blessing.

Thus far we have showed the meaning of ye Apostle, now let us see what
doctrine and comfort is to be gotten thereby.

First therefore, where he says, that ( We are chosen in Christ before the
foundation of the world) we may thereupon, as upon an immovable principle,
conclude these specialties: to wit, That our election is free, that it is
without us, that election is not to be sought in the matter of man, that
election is firm and ratified, that our salvation is founded in Christ alone,
that all merits of men are excluded, that they are called elect or chosen,
which are in Christ by faith: for the principle of our salvation stands
steadfast, He that believes in the son, shall not perish, but shall have
everlasting life. For by faith a passage is made from eternal election, to
glorification to come.

Some, out of this place do reason in this manner, God has chosen some, in
Christ, before the foundation of the world, Ergo God ordained the fall of man
before the foundation of the world. For of them which fell, some are chosen to
life, and some are reserved or kept to due condemnation. Now seeing it is
necessary, that men stood, before their fall: it follows, that God ordained
the creation of man in righteousness, and holiness, from the which he fell by
sin. Therefore, the creation of man, his corruption, his election, and his
reprobation are ordained of God.

To this argument I answer: That to ordeine and bring to pass is one thing:
to foreknow in eternal counsel another. God ordained the creation of man to
his own Image or likeness, that he should be righteous and holy: and it was
the fatherly will of God, that his creature should continue such a one. He did
foreknow yt man should fall after Satan had deceived him, yet notwithstanding
he ordained not his fall: yea rather, this his fall was contrary to Gods
ordinance, else had it not been deadly unto man. But in so much as God foreknew
man's discase, he ordained a remedy, to wit, his election after his fall in
Jesus Christ.

Therefore, the foreknowledge of God is not the cause of man's fall: but
contrariewise, his fall which was to come, was the cause of Gods foreknowledge.
For the thing depends not upon knowledge, but knowledge upon the thing.
Again, we have to understand, that the election of God is eternal, and before
all time: so that therein, in respect of time, nothing is to be thought before
or after. S. Paul therefore when he says ( That God has chosen us before the
foundation of the world) speaks in respect of us, who are then in deed said
to be elected, and chosen by Gods eternal decree, when we believe in Christ,
and endeavor to live in holiness and innocence.

Heerevpon it follows, that the blasphemous speeches of such are execrable
and accursed which say: If I am elected and chosen, why then mine iniquity
shall not condemn me, the counsel of God is unchangeable. If I be not
elected and chosen, why then neither faith, nor desire to live virtuously will
do me any good. The manner of election which is conditional, confuteth these
kind of speeches. We are chosen in Christ, Ergo we are chosen upon this
condition, if we be in Christ: that is, if we shall believe in Christ.
Wherefore he that is condemned is condemned through his own default, because
when he was fallen, he refused to take hold of Gods right hand, whose will it
was to lift him up again. This is proved by the end of the ministry of the
word. For God sent the Apostles, and their successors also abroad to this end,
That they should preach the Gospel, and that they which believed should have
life everlasting. Our salvation therefore out of doubt is conditional, Col. 1.
13.
as these words of Paul bear record, Si modo, etc. If you continue grounded
and stablished in the faith. Participes, Heb. 3. 6.
etc. We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the confidence, and the
reioicing of the hope unto the end. 1. Tim. 2. 15.
Mulier, etc. The woman shall be saved, if she continue in faith. Si tamen,
etc. If so be we shall be sound clothed and not naked. 2. Cor. 5. 3.
Christ in like case beats into our heads this condition, Ioh. 3. 18.
Qui crediderit, etc. He that believes, shall not be condemned: but he that
believes not, Luke. 13. 5
is condemned already. Nisi, etc. Except ye amend your lives, Ioh. 15. 7.
ye shall all likewise perish. Si manseritis, etc. If ye abide in me, and my
words abide in you, ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Upon this
simplicity of Gods word, let us steadfastly stay our selves, neither let us
suffer our selves to be withdrawn from it by any sophistry: let us give to
God the praise of truth: and let us be truly resolved in our selves, that Gods
will is to do that indeed, which he witnesses in his word he will do.

But if we be not able to answer to all the crafty conclusions of
Sophisters, which wrest the Scripture diversely, to maintain and uphold their
decrees of destiny: let us confess, that we are but babes in the school of
Christ, and let us hold fast the grounds of godliness, which we have atteined
unto, by an unfeigned faith: neither let these most sweet and delicate saiengs
be snatched from us, 1. Tim. 1. 15.
Fidelis sermo, etc. This is a true saying, and by all means worthy to be
received, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. 1. Tim. 2. 3
4. 5. 6.
Again, Hoc honestum, etc. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
Savior, who will that all men shall be saved, and come unto the knowledge of
the truth. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, which
is the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all men. And the Lord
himself says, Venite, etc. Come unto me, Matthew. 9. 13.
all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will refresh you. And again,
Non veni, etc. I came not into the world to call the righteous, 2. Pet. 3. 9
but sinners to repentance. Again, Deus est, etc. The Lord is patient toward
us, and would have no man perish, but would all men to come to repentance.
Romans 10. 11. 12.
Again, Omnis, etc. Whosoever believes in him, shall not be ashamed: for
there is no difference between the Jew and the Grecian: for he that is Lord
ouerall, is rich unto all that call upon him. Again, Apparuit, etc. For the
grace of God, Tit. 2. 11. 12. 13.
which brings salvation unto all men, has appeared: and teaches us that we
should deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and that we should live soberlie
and righteouslie, and godly in this present world: looking for the blessed
hope and appearing of the glory of the mighty God, and of our Savior Jesus
Christ. These and such like saiengs let us set against all sophistry, nothing
regarding the foul language of sophisters, albeit they miscall us at their
pleasure, tearming us, fools, dolts, blockheads, asses, and otherwise as they
list. Let Christ alone be our wisdom, who (as we know well enough) hated all
sophistry.

5. 6. and 7. Verses.
5 Who has predestinate us, to be adopted through Jesus Christ unto himself,
according to the good pleasure of his vvil,

6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, vvhervvith he has made us
accepted in his beloved,

7 By whom we have redemption, through his blood, even the forgiveness of
sins, according to his rich grace.

Who has predestinate us unto the adoption of his children, through Jesus
Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise
of his glory and grace, whereby he has made us acceptable in the beloved, in
whom we have redemption by his blood, even the remission of sins, according
to the riches of his grace. THis is an exposition, or rather a certain
notable, and excellent repetition of the last reason, with greater weight of
things and words, and also a noting of circumstances. For in this place ye
Apostle fetches further, and beats upon that, which before he had spoken,
heaping up such things together, as seemed to make the more for the plain
proof of the matter. Now, that we may the better draw out such treasure, as
is stored up in this part, and apply the same to our use, let us lay it down
in points, and let us consider and examine every particular member by it self
severally, and weight them thoroughly, and (as they say) to the proof.

Of this part, there are eight members, which thus follow in order.
IN the first place he makes mention, of the very: foundation or principal
cause of our spiritual blessing, that is to say, of our salvation, namely
predestination: whereby God had a foreknowledge of their salvation (even before
the world was made) which should believe in Jesus Christ. For as our Lord Jesus
Christ alone, is the matter of our election, so is he also of our
predestination.

In the second place he sets down the form or manner of predestination: to
wit, (...): that is to say, adoption: whereby we are adopted into the sons,
which were before, through sin, the sons of wrath. This predestinate
adoption, is applied unto us by faith, according to that saying of the Apostle.
Ioh. 1. 12.
Potestatem dedit, etc. He has given power to them that believe in him, to be
the sons of God. Now, seeing God, by the preaching of the Gospel, calls (
all men) unto faith, there is no doubt but Gods will is indeed, that ( all men)
should be saved. For, far be it from the minds of the godly, to have such a
thought: namely, that the heart of him which has mercy differs from the
voice of him which calls.

In the third place, because it is come to pass through the sin of our first
parents, and by our own default, that we are estraunged from God and put back
a far off from Gods household, the Apostle shows a mean, whereby we are
joined to God again, received into his household, and adopted for his sons.
This remedy or mean is Jesus Christ, the only Mediator of God and men, who
is apprehended and taken hold upon by faith in the preaching of the Gospel,
wherein the holy Ghost is effectual and mighty in working. Here all merits
of men, which make nothing for our salvation, are manifestly overthrown and
laid along: likewise all prerogative and boasting of the flesh is here
confounded, That he which glories, 1. Cor. 1. 31
might glory in the Lord, in whom we are both elect and predestinate.

In the fourth place he expresses the compelling cause of this excellent grace
and adoption: namely, (...) that is to say, the bountiful, liberal, and
fatherly affection, or entier love of our heavenly father toward mankind.
This good will and love of God, the Angels blaze abroad at the birth of Christ,
Luke. 1. 14
saying: Gloria, etc. Glory to God on high, in earth peace, and toward men
good will. The very same has our heavenly Father himself testified from
heaven, Math. 3. 4* 17. and 17. 5
Hic est, etc. This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased, that is to
say, in whom I am become bountiful and favorable toward mankind to work
his salvation. Let us therefore take heed, that we seek not the good pleasure
and will of God toward us elsewhere, than in Jesus Christ alone, because in
him, without all doubt, we shall find the same by faith.

In the fifth place, the last end of our adoption is added, which is thrice
repeated in this Chapter: to wit, That the glory of his grace might be
praised. For as our adoption is from God, so must the same be referred to God,
that his goodness might be praised and magnified through Jesus Christ. This
end is not to be separated from the grace of adoption: whereby manifestly
appears, how necessary new obedience is, in them which are regenerate and
borne again by faith. For herein consists new obedience, that we should
glorify God in our mind, in our heart, in our voice, in our works, and (to be
short) in our whole life. Let them therefore be ashamed of their folly, which
teach, that the good works of Christians, are not only not necessary, but
also hurtful unto men.

In the fifth place, he declares from whence, and out of what fountain that
fatherly good will and grace of God toward us does flow, when he says: (
Wherewith he has made us accepted in his beloved*) This beloved Jesus Christ,
is that fountain, out of which that exceeding great grace of God toward us
does issue: where upon that falls out iump which we noted before, that none
shall be partaker of this grace, but they which lay hands upon this beloved
son of God by faith.

In the seventh place, some thing is said of redemption: to wit, That the
beloved son of God has redeemed us by his blood, and washed away our sins,
that how many of us so ever rest upon him with a steadfast faith, might appear
just and righteous in the sight of God.

In the eight place, the principal cause of our redemption, wrought by Jesus
Christ, is touched, where it is said, ( According to the riches of his grace:)
that is to say, according to the everlasting and unspeakable grace of God,
whereby he would that his beloved son should be made a cleansing sacrifice
for the sins of men: that the justice of God, by that means might be
satisfied, and that place might be left for his mercy. ( The riches of his
grace) do signify, (after the Hebrew phrase) Gods unmeasurable, bottomless,
and everlasting grace (as I said even now:) which manner of speech the Apostle
uses upon especial reason, and singular purpose. Let us therefore consider,
not only of what great price the blood of Christ is in the sight of God: but
also, how great the abundance of Gods grace is, flowing from the same: least
any should think, that this grace of God stretches it self but to a few: or
that it is all spent long ago, considering the degrees of ages past, and by
that means, not to be sufficient for the cleansing of our sins, upon whom
the end of the world is come.

See how richly stored this short point is, with most excellent and heavenly
things. Wherefore let the same be diligently learned, and each several word
thereof thoroughly considered. For, the mystery of our salvation is no where,
either more briefly, or more fitly described.

Verses. 8. 9. and. 10.
8 Whereby he has been abundant toward us, in all vvisdome and understanding.

9 And has opened unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good
pleasure, which he had purposed in him.

10 That in the dispensation of the fullness of the times, he might gather
together in one, all things, both which are in heaven, and which are in
earth, even in Christ.

Which grace he has shed upon us abundantly in all wisdom and prudence, in
making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure,
which he purposed in himself, to have it declared when the time was full come
to gather together all things in Christ, both the things which are in heaven,
and also the things which are in earth, even in him. LET the trim order of
Paul's words be marked. Hitherto he has handled the causes of our blessing and
salvation wonderfully, both with weighty words and matter. Now he comes to
the instrument, whereby that spiritual grace is revealed, offered, and
communicated unto us: namely, to the very ministry of the word, of which
ministry he speaks, not after a common manner, but deeply and diuinelie,
even to this end, that he might kindle in us a greater zeal of this heavenly
grace. The sum of this point, therefore is this. That the Apostle teaches,
that the grace of God which brings salvation to all men, is plentifully
powered upon us by the Gospel, according to the good pleasure of God, that at
the length all might be gathered again in Christ. Now let us thoroughly
consider the several words. In the first place ye Apostle uses this word
((...) to abound) whereby those riches of Gods grace are signified, whereof he
spoke before: that we might know, that the grace of God is sufficient to save
all men. For the fountain of grace is never drawn so dry, but every one may
fetch from it to serve their turn, so they carry faith with them: neither can
the sins of men be so many and so great, but they may be overwhelmed and
drowned in the flood flowing from this fountain, so that men seek to get into
Noah's Ark, that is to say, into the household of God, by the faith of Christ.
Let no man therefore despair for ye greatness and multitude of his sins, but
whiles the time of grace yet lasts, let him earnestly repent, and fly unto
him for succor who cries out, That he came into ye world to save sinners, and
to receive the repentant into grace and favor.

He adds the effect or fruit of the Gospel in the hearers: to wit, that
thereby they are instructed ( In all wisdom and understanding.) For so does
the old Interpretour, and Erasmus, translate the words very well. Now these
words are rightly discerned, if we refer wisdom ((...)) to knowledge: and
understanding ((...)) to practice. For these two things we must fetch from the
preaching of the Gospel. Wisdom therefore signifies the knowledge of the
Gospel, that is say, the knowledge of God, and of all those things which are
needful to be known for the obtaining of salvation. Understanding, being the
gouernesse of all our purposes and enterprises, applies that knowledge to the
framing of our life, and practicing of that which is good: that we may abound,
not only in knowledge, but also in judgment, as the Apostle says to the
Philippians. Philip. 1. 9.
Out of this effect or fruit of the Gospel, these specialties following may be
gathered.

The first, that the preaching of the Gospel is the revelation of Gods grace
toward mankind: and also of his election, whereby he chose us in Christ.

The second, that the perfect wisdom and understanding of Gods children is
contained in the Gospel, so much as is sufficient for the obtaining of
salvation.

The third, which is concluded upon the two former, that it is lawful for Gods
children, to set light by and to have in contempt, without fear, all doctrines
of men and Angels contrary to the Gospel, Gal. 1. 8.
yea, to count them accursed, according to that saying, Let him be accursed
which preaches any other Gospel.

Furthermore, whereas the Apostle presently adds, ( And has opened unto us
the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure) he commends yet
again the Gospel unto us, in which commendation three things are principally
to be marked.

First, that he calls the Gospel, a mystery: that is to say, a secreat:
whereupon it follows, that it is not the wisdom of man's reason, but of
heavenly grace. For if the reason of man could reach unto it, Paul would not
have called it a mystery. A reason why he calls it by such a name, Romans 16
25. 26.
is expressed in his Epistle to the Romans, in these words: Iuxta Euangelium,
etc. According to my Gospel, and preaching of Jesus Christ, by the revelation
of the mystery, which was kept secreat since the world began: But now is
opened and published among all nations, by the Scriptures of the Prophets, at
the commandment of the everlasting God, for the obedience of faith.

Secondly, that the Gospel is the mystery of Gods will, according to his good
pleasure? But what is that will of good pleasure in God? That all nations might
believe, and obey the Gospel. For so we taught even now out of the Apostles
words.

Now, in that the event or success is not aunswerable to the will of Gods good
pleasure, the default is in men, who (to their own destruction) maliciously
refuse salvation freely offered. Therefore, the preaching of grace if thou
look to the purpose of God, and his good pleasure, is universal, and
stretches unto all. But if thou consider the event or success, it seems to
be particular, and to reach but to some, which (doubtless) comes to pass
through man's own fault, not through the appointment of God which created him,
1. Tim. 2. 4.
and gave his son to redeem him. For God in deed would have all men saved,
and come to the knowledge of the truth: as we have showed before at large,
where we declared that our election was co^ditional.

Thirdly, that the Apostle makes the good pleasure of God the Father, the
cause of the revelation of this mystery, as before he made it the cause of our
election and predestination. Whereby we are admonished, that we must judge of
our election and predestination by our calling: which calling, seeing it is as
well universal, according to yt saying: Ite in vniuersum, etc. Go ye
throughout the whole world, and preach the Gospel unto every creature,
(whiles he names ( every creature), he takes away the difference of people
and persons:) as also conditional, namely, the condition of faith, according
to that saying: Qui credident, etc. He that believes shall be saved: therefore
shall election and predestination be likewise conditional, which are not to
be separated from Christ, who is the matter of them both.

Now follows a double circumstance of this good pleasure of God, the first
is, of the time of the revelation of the mystery of the Gospel: the second
is, of the end of the revelation. For when he says ( In the dispensation of
the fullness of the times) he signifies, that the good pleasure of God was
then revealed, when the time was come, which God had appointed with himself.
Now, this time, as it was marked of the Patriarch Jacob with a special sign
and token: so was it noted of Daniel the Prophet with a certain bound and
limit. Genesis 49. 1^.
Jacob says, Non auferetur, etc. The scepter shall not depart from Judah,
until Shilo come: that is to say, The seed promised to our forefathers. Daniel
reckons three score and ten weeks of the years from the captivity of
Babylon, Dan. 9. 24
until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Of this time speaks Paul,
saiing: Gal. 4. 4. 5
Quando vent, etc. When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his
son made of a woman, and made under the law, that he might redeem them which
were under the law. The word ( Dispensation) which Paul uses in this place,
is called in Greek (...), of which word there is a double use. For one while
(and that according to the Etymology or right property of the same) it
signifies a care or charge, and good ordering of an house and household. An
other while (but Metaphoricallie, or by translation,) it signifies a disposing
and fit framing of things which are to be done: or, a certain keeping of order
in handling of matters.

The second circumstance is of the end of the revelation of Gods good
pleasure, which is ( To gather together in one, all things even in Christ.) The
Greek word (...), which Saint Paul uses, does signify, to join together
into one body as it were, things set a sunder and scattered, and to knit them
to one head. For the Substantive (...), (from the which the Verb is derived)
is (as it were) a certain summarie, and a gathering together of sundry parts
in one whole body. The Apostle therefore means, that creatures, which were
scattered, are gathered together in one, through Jesus Christ, that being
gathered together, they might be all under one head. The division following
comprehends the whole Church. ( Which are (says he) in heaven) that is to
say, the holy Angels, and believers, which departed this life, before the
son of God took flesh of the Virgin: ( And which are in earth,) that is to
say, all such as do believe, and shall believe in Christ, already revealed
and come into the world, shall be under one head, as it were a body consisting
of many and sundry members. Here we are put in mind of faith, whereby we are
knit unto Christ our head: and of love, whereby we are coupled in brotherhoode
one with an other. This brotherhood or fellowship, is commended unto us by the
Sacraments of the Church. Baptism bears witness that we are baptized into
one body. The supper of the Lord, is a token of ye Communion which we have
with Christ: and it is a certain testimonial and assured warrant of spiritual
fraternity and fellowship between our selves.

Verse. 11. and. 12
11 In whom also we are chosen, when we were predestinate, according to the
purpose of him, which works all things, after the counsel of his own
will.

12 That we which first trusted in Christ, should be unto the praise of his
glory.

In whom also we are chosen, being predestinate according to the purpose of him
which works all things according to the counsel of his will, that we which
before hoped in Christ, should be unto the praise of his glory. THus far the
Apostle has spoken of all the elected and chosen in Christ generally: now by
distribution he applies the generality, unto two specialties: and first he
touches the Jews, declaring that they are made partakers of heavenly grace.
And he sets down in order three causes of this heavenly grace: to wit, the
efficient, the final, and the isntrumental cause.

He shows the efficient cause, when he says, ( Predestinate according to
the purpose of him.) Concerning this cause, read that which we have noted
before already.

He adds the final cause, ( That we should be unto the praise of his
glory,) that is to say, that God himself might be praised for the greatness
of his grace and mercy showed unto us.

He ioineth here unto ye instrument, when he says, ( That we which first hoped
or trusted in Christ.) For under ye name of hope, he does in this place
comprehend faith also. Now, whereas I expound that of faith, which is here
ascribed to hope, therein is no obscurity or hardness. For, as faith is
oftentimes taken for hope, so is hope taken for faith, by reason of a mutual
consequence, or following one of an other. For that, which faith lays hold
upon and possesses presently, that does hope look and wait for to come
hereafter. These three causes of grace the Apostle sets down in this
place, which grace, (as before he called it Gods blessing, or his adoption:) so
here it may be understood by this word ( Chosen) or choice: even to this end,
that we may know it is Gods free gift. For it goes not by lot that man is
chosen, but it is the will of God which offers salvation freely unto all.
Now, where he adds, ( Which works all things after the counsel of his own
will) he gives us a double doctrine, or lesson to learn. The first is, that
God is not tied (according to the destiny of the Stoikes) to second causes,
but at free and full liberty to do what he list. For he, which by his
counsel can, and by his power will do, is not compelled by any manner of
necessity at all to do this or that. For things depending upon necessity,
are neither governed by counsel, nor dispensed withal by will. The second is,
that God works in his Church all things that are wholesome and good: and
nothing that is evil, or comes of sin: as some out of this place
unadvisedly conclude, saying: He that says all things, excludes nothing. But
their reason is ouerthrown by the Apostles words. For if God works all things
by the counsel of his will: and his will be most holy, and so good as nothing
better, intending nothing that is evil in any respect, Psalm. 5, 4.
as the Psalmist most plainly pronounces, Non volens, etc. Thou art a God
which can not away with iniquity: truly it cannot be that God should be the
author of sin, or of any evil proceeding of a fault. Lastly, ye circumstance
of the place restrains yt universal word ( all things) to one certain kind
of action or deed. For ye text hangs thus together, ( Which works all
things, that we should be unto the praise of his glory,) that is to say, he
brings to pass, that we both will and do those things, which turn to the
glory and praise of God. The Apostle therefore speaks manifestly, of the
wholesome or healthful workings of God in his Church. For he moves our will,
that we may will, and our strength, that we may not will in waste.

Verse. 13, and. 14
13 In whom also ye have trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, even
the gospel of your salvation, wherein also, after that ye believed, ye were
sealed with the holy spirit of promise.

14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the
possession purchased unto the praise of his glory.

In whom also ye (having heard the word of truth, even the Gospel of your
salvation, wherein ye believed,) were sealed with the holy spirit of promise,
which is the earnest of our inheritance, unto redemption, to the praise of his
glory. THis is an other member of our division, wherein he applies the
partaking of heavenly grace, spiritual blessing, adoption, and election with
the Saints, unto the Gentiles, under the name of the Ephesians, drawing his
argument from the effect or fruit of the Gospel preached among the Ephesians.
But because this part is very full of spiritual doctrine, I will lay it open,
and declare it in his proper members, to the intent that the doctrine may the
more plainly be perceived, and made to serve our use.

In the first place mention is made of the preaching of the Gospel, whereby
God reuealeth unto the world his will touching salvation freely given, and
offers the same indifferently unto all, Mark. 16. 15.
without respect of person or people, according to that saying, Go ye
throughout the whole world, and preach the Gospel unto every creature.

In the second place follows faith, which being conceived in us by the
Gospel preached, the holy Ghost working effectually in our hearts, lays
fast hold upon the salvation which the Gospel offers, giving unto God the
praise of his truth.

In the third place is added the sealing of the holy spirit, wherewith we are
then said to be seized, when we bring forth the true fruits of faith, by the
faith of Jesus Christ. This holy spirit, the Apostle calls ( The spirit of
promise,) both because it seals unto us the good things promised, and also
because it is given us by promise.

In the fourth place is added the use of this holy spirit given unto us:
namely, ( That it should be the earnest of our inheritance:) which we do not
yet perfectly possess, but look and wait for the same, hereafter to come.
For as that is an earnest, when some thing of the price is given, which is not
to be drawn back again, but to be performed and fully down paid: so the
giving of the holy spirit, is a certain part of our inheritance, bestowed
upon us, for this end: to wit, that we might be assured of the full and
perfect possession of the whole inheritance, which is everlasting life. And
why is it called an inheritance, but because it pleased God, of his fatherly
goodness, without our merits, to appoint the same our portion, which are made
the members of Christ the natural son of God, unto whom all things, which
are his fathers, do belong.

In the fifth place the circumstaunce of time is noted, ( Until the redemption
of the possession purchased,) says the Apostle: that is to say, until the day
of judgment, when we which are redeemed with the price of Christ's blood, shall
obtain and enioie our full inheritance. ( Until the redemption) therefore,
that is to say, until the day of redemption: ( Of the possession purchased,)
that is to say, for us, who by our redemption wrought in his blood, are put in
possession of the promised inheritance.

Hitherto we have untwisted, as it were, and laid open this present point, in
his proper parts or members: in the which our Apostle sets out very
trimly, the manner and order of our restitution or redemption. For he
begins at the preaching of the Gospel, and teaches us, that faith must be
added thereunto: which being done, the sealing of the holy spirit is felt in
the heart, which is a certain earnest as it were of the promised inheritance.
The last end of all these, is the glory of God, of his mercy healing, and
also saving all such as believe. For (says Saint Ambrose) as it is ye
Physicians praise and commendation, if he heal many: so the praise of Gods
glory is, when many are won to believe with unfeigned faith. Finally, we
must mark, that the Apostle decketh the Gospel of Christ with a double title.
For first, by the figure Antonomasia, he calls the Gospel ( The word of
truth:) which title is taken of the matter contained in the Gospel. For the
Gospel does contain the everlasting truth of God, and an undeceivable
testimony of obteining salvation through Christ. The second is, ( The Gospel
of salvation,) which is taken of the end of the Gospel. For the Gospel was
ordained and given for our salvation. For, as the Law, whiles it requires
righteousness, promises salvation and life to them which fulfill the same:
and contrariwise, threateneth damnation and death to all the transgressors
thereof: so the Gospel, because we have not the righteousness which the Law
requires, shows Christ unto us, who is ye end of the Law to all them that
believe. Thus ye righteousness and salvation, which we could not reach unto in
doing, we obtain in believing, whiles ye righteousness of Christ being imputed
unto us, and our sins washed away by ye sacrifice of himself, we are made
righteous, and heirs also of salvation. Neither is this slightlie to be
ouerslipped, that as before he made the glory of God the end of our election,
of our predestination, and likewise of our calling: so here also, he makes
the same the end of our sanctification. Whereupon it follows, that all
glory of salvation, must be taken quite away from every creature, and merit
of man, and given to God alone by Jesus Christ. Wherefore, as in all things
that are good, so here chiefelie that short sentence of Nazianzen takes
place, (...), that is to say, Make God the beginning and end of every thing.

Verse. 15, and. 16.
15 Therefore also, after that I heard of the faith, which ye have in the Lord
Jesus, and love toward all Saints,

16 I cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers.

For this cause I also having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and your
love toward all the Saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention
of you in my prayers. THe Apostle having reckoned up the benefits of God
bestowed upon mankind, does show, what the thinking upon these benefits
wrought in himself: namely, a moving and stirring of him up to give God
thanks, who is the Author and fountain of so great good. It is meet that
this deed of the Apostle, should be unto us a rule well worthy the marking,
throughout the whole course of our life: that the remembrance and calling to
account of Gods good gifts and benefits, might stir us up to thanksgiving.
For he which thinks upon Gods benefits, or hears them rehearsed or named,
and bursteth not forth with an affection of heart into thanksgiving, besides
that he is unthankful to God, and therefore unrighteous: so he deserves by his
unthankfulness, to be spoiled of all Gods graces. For, as in the possession of
things, not only the right of possessing, but also the lawful using of them
is required: so it is meet, that a Christian use those graces, which he
possesses by the merit of Christ, and therefore by good right, to the glory
of God the giver, with thanksgiving. Lastly, this place teaches, that this
is a most right order: namely, that thanksgiving for benefits received go
before, and that prayer follow by and by at the foot thereof, wherein we must
crave of God, the keeping of his benefits received, and other healthful gifts,
good and necessary. Furthermore, this place teaches us, that the profiting of
men in godliness, is the mere benefit of God. For, whiles Paul gives God
thanks, that the Ephesians profit in hope and charity (or trust and love,) he
acknowledges that God is the Author of this good. For he, of his free goodness,
raises up good governors of Common wealths, and sends sincere ministers of
the Gospel: besides that, he is forceable in working by his spirit, in the
hearts of the hearers of his word, both whiles they are present at the
preaching thereof, and also otherwise exercised in the same: bringing this to
pass in them: namely, that they should both believe and love him. Moreover,
this place teaches, what be the principal duties of Christians, which he
draws unto two heads, to wit, to ye faith of Jesus Christ, and to love
toward the Saints. These notwithstanding ought so to be understood, that
together with them, all things which are naturally joined with them: namely,
their necessary effects or fruits be also understood.

Faith therefore, when it has hope joined with it, invocation or calling upon
God, the fear of God, love, patience, and such like, they are not given unto
us, without their fruits.

Semblably, love comprehends the duties of love toward all men.

Verse. 17. and 18.
17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, might give
unto you, the spirit of wisdom and revelation, through the knowledge of him,

18 That the eyes of your understanding may be lightened.

That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, might give unto
you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of himself, and
lighten the eyes of your mind. THe Apostle declares, what he wishes to the
Ephesians in his prayers: to wit, ( The spirit of wisdom and revelation,
through the knowledge of Jesus Christ,) that is to say, a true knowledge of the
mystery of the Gospel, which the spirit reuealeth, when the Gospel is
effectual in the hearts of the hearers thereof, and the meditaters thereupon.
For seeing the Gospel guides us to the knowledge of Christ, who is the
wisdom of his Father given unto us of God: we are also possessed with the
spirit of wisdom, whereby the eyes of our mind are enlightened, to
understand the mystery of the Gospel. Now let us see the circumstaunces of
the Apostles prayer. The first is, that he prays unto God, who as he alone is
the Author of all good things: so he alone is to be called upon. The second
is, by and through whom he prays: this he shows when he says, ( The God of
our Lord Jesus Christ:) as if he should say: I lean not to mine own merits,
but boldly staieng my self upon the intercession, of Christ, I call upon God.
For he alone is the Mediator between God and men: and therefore he himself
said, 1. Tim. 2. 5
Quicquid, etc. Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, Math. 7. 7 16.
he shall give it you.

Athanasius puts these words ( Of our Lord Jesus Christ) in a Parenthesis,
Mark. 11. 24.
that glory should go with the word, Luke. 11. 9.
God, and not with the word Father. But this is pinched in too much, John. 14.
13 and 15. 7. and 16. 24.
or too strait laced: let us rather place the words in this order, ( The God of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and Father of glory.) For the Apostle seems to have
an eye to the words of the Lord after he was raised up from the dead, John. 20.
17.
and speaking in this manner, I ascend to my Father, and to your Father, to my
God, and to your God. Therefore was Christ borne a man, not only that he
might have a common Father with us, but also a God: from whom the greatest
comfort of the faithful flows. For thus does faith conclude. The Father and
God of our Lord Jesus Christ, is likewise our Father and God. Therefore, we are
partakers of all heavenly benefits with Christ, our copartner. Therefore his
will and pleasure is to do us good: and he both knows and also can give us
those things, that are healthful to serve for our salvation. But how hangs
this together? What? Is not the son equal to the Father? As (doubtless) he
is consubstantiall, so is he coequall with the Father: But the son abased
himself, Phi. 2. 7. 8.
putting on the state and condition of a servant. And albeit it agrees
properly with the nature of man, that Christ should be subject unto God the
Father: yet nevertheless, that is referred to the very person, in respect of
the unity of the person, because Christ is both God and man. Furthermore, God
is called ( The Father of glory:) first, because all things are full of his
glory: secondly, because all glory belongs to him alone: Lastly, because
he is the Author and fountain of all glory. Now the cause why Saint Paul in
this place gives God this title, is this. He prays unto God, that it would
please him to give the Ephesians the spirit of wisdom, etc. Which gift
(doubtless) both tends to the glory of God: and also brings to pass,
that the Ephesians are made partakers of heavenly glory. For it is a common
thing and much used in the scriptures, to give certain titles unto God, in
consideration of the matter which is handeled. Whereupon it follows, that one
while he is called, 2. Cor. 1. 3.
Pater misericordiarum, The Father of mercies: 2. Cor. 1. 3.
another while, Deus omnis consolationis, The God of all comfort: Psalm. 88. 1.
Deus salutis, The God of salvation: Deus pacis and dilectionis, 2. Cor. 13. 11.
The God of peace and love. Of this kind there are many examples in the
Psalms of David, Psalm. 17. 1
as when it is said, Dominus fortitudo, etc. The Lord is my strength, Psalm. 43.
2
and the horn of my health. Again, Dominus, Psalm. 118. 14.
etc. The Lod is my rock. Again, Deus, etc. God is my refuge and my strength.
Again, Deus, etc. The Lord is a God of vengeance, the Lord is a God of
judgment.

It shall be good and profitable for us, to follow and keep this order in our
prayers. For it is much material and auailable, to stir up and quicken our
minds as we are a praieng.

The third circumstance is, that Saint Paul wishes healthful things to the
faithful Ephesians in Christ: to wit, ( The spirit of wisdom and revelation,
and the enlightening of the eyes of their mind,) that they might know Christ.
This circumstaunce admonishes the ministers of the word of their duty:
namely, that they ought not only to teach their hearers healthful things,
but also to wish them healthful things.

Verse. 18. 19. and 20.
18 That ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what is the
riches of his glorious inheritance in the Saints, 19 And what is the exceeding
greatness of his power toward us, which believe, according to the vvorking
of his mighty power,

20 Which he wrought in Christ.

That ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what be the riches of
the love of his inheritance in the Saints, and what is the superexcellent
great nesse of his power to us ward, which believe according to the working of
the power of the might which he has wrought in Christ. THe Apostle declares
to what end ( The spirit of wisdom and revelation) which he wishes to the
Ephesians, pertains unto wit, and knowledge, that they might understand, how
great that treasure of heavenly grace is, which they obtain in Christ.

And he uses in this place a figure of Rhetorike, called Expolitio, both to
amplify and enlarge the thing: and also, that this treasure may the better be
valued, (as much as may be) according to the price and worthiness of the same.
In the first place he wishes, that the Ephesians may know ( What is the hope
of their vocation or calling:) that is to say, that they might understand, how
notable, precious, and excellent, those heavenly graces are, which Christ
sets forth in his Gospel, and to the which, such as believe are called. In
the word ( Hope) is contained a figure called Metonymia. For ( Hope) in this
place is taken for the thing whereto it is applied, that is to say, for the
thing hoped. Gal. 5. 5.
So the Apostle to the Galathians, calls hoped righteousness, The hope of
righteousness, whereby we are made like unto God in all eternity or
euerlastingnesse, after we have departed this life in true faith and Christian
calling. The hope therefore of our calling, is that happiness, whereunto the
Gospel calls us.

This hope the Apostle expounds, saying: ( And what is the riches of his
glorious inheritance) that is to say, That ye may know how great and
inestimable that glorious inheritance of the children of God is: namely, of
them which believe the Gospel.

Hereunto is added an amplification or enlargement drawn from the cause ( And
what is the exceeding greatness of his power, toward us which believe:) as if
he should have said, We obtain not that treasure of heavenly graces by our
own strength and ability, or by our own merits and deserts: but by the power
of God. Neither must we idley pass over that, where he says, ( Toward us
which believe.) For he means, that faith is the instrument, whereby we
receive and possess this treasure, the holy spirit being an assured earnest
of the same, as we have declared before.

And where he adds, ( According to the working of his mighty power) that is
done for vehemency and force sake, that we might be quickened, earnestly to
consider what the cause should be, from whence so great a treasure of
salvation does come: and that we might not, either by slothfulness, or
mistrustfulnesse ware faintharted and weary, to go forward in the course or
race which we have begun.

The words Robur, Potentia, and Efficacia, in English, Power, Might, and
Working, serve to none other end, but to teach us that the power of God cannot
be overcome, whereby as he is able to do what he will: so he will give to them
that believe, the treasure promised in Christ, in due time: of which thing he
sets down a certain token, saying: ( Which he wrought in Christ,) that is
to say, which power God declared in Christ: as if he said, God showed no small
sign of his power in Christ your head, whose members seeing you are, he will
glorify you, which believe, with the like power.

The words, Robur, Potentia, and Efficacia, are thus distinguished, and
discerned, the one from the other. (...), Robur, is of nature, and is properly,
actiuitie or might. (...), Potentia, that is power or ability, has respect
unto the things whereto they are applied. (...), Efficacia, that is, efficacy
or working, is the effect of both. Some make the difference thus, that Robur is
as it were the root, Potentia the tree, and Efficacia the fruit.

Out of this place of the Apostle, let us learn to set the power of God,
both against the mistrustfulnesse of our flesh, and also against the arguments
of foolish reason, wherewith the devil bewitching men's minds, would withdraw
us from the hope of our calling, which we have in Christ Jesus.

Verses. 20. 21. 22. and 23.
20 When he raised him from the dead, and set him at his right hand in the
heavenly places,

21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and domination, and
every name that is named, not in this world only, but also in that which is
to come.

22 And has made all things subject under his feet, and has appointed him
over all things, to be the head of the Church,

23 Which is his body, even the fullness of him that fills all in all things.

VVhiles he raised him from the dead, and made him sit at his right hand in
heavenly things, above all principality (or rule) and power, and might, and
dominion (or Lordship) and above all names that are named, not only in this
world, but also in the world to come, and has put all things under his feet,
and set him above all things, even the head of the Church, which is his body,
and the fullness of him that fills all in all. WHat manner of working the
exceeding power of God has, which ye Apostle says, God has wrought in
Christ, he declares by a very trim division, wherein the glory of Christ
triumphing is set before our eyes: and the principal points of our faith in
Christ are recited, the exposition whereof more at large, is to be fetched out
of other places of holy Scripture.

Now, to the intent we may effectually apply every thing to the stirring up
and confirming of our faith, we will lay it down in parts, and divide this
conclusion into seven parts or members: then will we show, and that briefly,
what our faith may gather out of them severally.

The first member is declared in these words, ( When he raised him from the
dead,) that is to say, God, in raising his son from the dead, showed the
working of his exceeding power. Ioh. 19. 33
Of this first member, there are three points. The first, of the Lords death.
The second, of his resurrection. The third, of the power whereby he was raised.
John. 20. 1. 2. etc.
Of these three points we will give you a very short admonition The history
of the Lords death, is well known by ye writings of the Prophets, ye Apostles,
and the Creeds. But ye power and working thereof is diligently to be
distinguished and sundered, from the passions or sufferings, and the deaths of
other Saints or holy men. For the passions or sufferings, and the deaths of
other Saints, were either martyrdoms, or trials of their faith and confession:
or else, as for example in the thief, certain punishments for offenses. But
the death and passion of Christ is far otherwise to be considered, which
Christ himself defines to be sanctification, that is to say, an offering up
of himself for many. And he defines the same (...): for he says thus, Mat.
20. 28.
The son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, Mark. 10. 45.
and to give his life (...), a redemption for many. Now, (...) is not
redemption, Luke. 22. 27.
as the old intrepreter has translated it, but the price of redemption. For,
(...) in Greek signifies, whatsoever is paid down for their redemption,
which are kept in captivity, which Homer in his Iliads calls (...), that is
to say, the price of redemption.

The passion and death of Christ therefore is (...), the price down paid for
the redemption of men, who were held captives and prisoners under the power of
the devil: which price was paid to God, by whose just judgment we were
captives. This price has his infinite estimation, and vncountable value, from
the wonderful union or knitting of Gods nature and man's in one person.
Whereupon Saint Paul doubts not to speak thus: Acts. 20. 28.
Ecclesiam, etc. The Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood.

Hereunto we will add a fuller definition for declaration sake. The passion
and death of our Lord Jesus Christ, God and man, is a propitiatory sacrifice,
or sacrifice of atonement, wherein the eternal son of the eternal God,
being made man, offered himself by the eternal spirit unto his father, that
by this his oblation and obedience, he might both purge the sins of the
world, and appease the wrath of God, to the end that all such as believe,
might be sanctified unto life everlasting through him. As by this definition
our understanding and judgment is rightly informed and taught concerning the
passion and death of Christ: so our faith must be stirred up and steadfastly
resolved, that sin is so washed away by the death of Christ, as that God
does remember it no more. Moreover we must and ought, with continual
thankfulnsse, and innocence of life, to advance and extol this great benefit.

The second point of this first member is, of the Lords resurrection, whereof
we will show briefly what is to be thought faithfully and godly. First of
all we must hold fast the testimonies of his resurrection, which are of three
sorts, as commonly I make them: touching these, the Catechism, and the
history of Christ's resurrection set forth in the Gospel, must be looked
upon and considered. The definition of the Lords resurrection must be
maintained: to wit, that the resurrection of Christ from the dead, is Christ's
victory, and his triumph over sin, death, hell, and over the whole kingdom
of Satan. For Christ by his resurrection, fulfilled the promise: Genesis 3. 15.
Semen mulieris, etc. The seed of the woman shall bruise the Serpents head:
that is to say, (as Saint John the Lords Apostle expounds it,) 1. Ioh. 3. 8
Christus apparuit, etc. Christ appeared that he might destorie the works of
the devil. Christ therefore rising again, is conqueror over Satan, which
Satan lies conquered and crushed under the feet of Christ the conqueror,
that he is no more able to draw the faithful, that is to say, the members
of Christ, into death and destruction, although he bear full swaie over the
reprobate and obstinate: and uses many and sundry guilefull sleights, to
provoke the faithful to taste the forbidden fruit, and so to be cast again
out of the Lords Paradise: that is to say, he goes about with corrupt
doctrine, and lewd manners, to infect and poison the faithful, that the holy
Ghost might be driven out of them, and so they, through the loss of faith,
might be shut out of Gods household, and so become castawaies. In the third
place the fruits of the Lords resurrection must be gathered, which the godly
alone enioie: the first whereof is, 1. Cor. 15. 17.
remission of sins. Si Christus, etc. If Christ be not risen, ye are yet in
your sins. Hereunto serves that saying of the Prophet Daniel: Dan. 9. 24
Auferetur, etc. Wickedness shall be finished, sins shall be sealed up, and
iniquity reconciled. And although the reconcilement of iniquity, be most
properly appertaining to Christ's passion and death, as before is declared: yet
notwithstanding, it is also very well applied to his resurrection, because
this is the accomplishment of all Christ's benefits. The second is, our
justification: Resurrexit, Romans 4. 25
etc. Christ is risen again for our justification. And Daniel says, Dan. 9. 24
Adducetur, etc. Everlasting righteousness shall be brought in. Does not Saint
Paul likewise define the obedience of Christ to be our righteousness? Both
are true. For whatsoever is given to one action or deed of Christ, the same is
rightly given to them all, by reason of the ordinary appointment and
ordinance common to all his works and actions. The third is, Ioh. 16. 7
the giving of the spirit. Nisi, etc. Except I go my way, that comforter
shall not come. And Paul says, Emisit, Romans 8. 15
etc. He has sent the spirit of his son into your hearts, Gal. 4. 6.
which cries, Abba Pater, Abba Father. The fourth is, the confirming of the
covenant of grace, or an assurance and certain warrant of a good conscience
before God. For so says S. Peter, Habentes, etc. Having a good conscience. 1.
Pet. 3. 16, and. 21
And, In that a good conscience makes request unto God, The words at large lie
in this order, Cui respondens, etc. To the which also the figure that now
saves us (even Baptism) agrees: (not the putting away of the filth of the
flesh, but in that a good conscience makes request unto GOD) by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ. The fifth is, the renewing of our selves, which is
after two sorts, to wit, of our souls, and of our bodies. Of our souls,
according to that saying of the Apostle, Romans 6. 4.
Resurrexit, etc. Christ was raised up from the dead, by the glory of his
Father, that we also should walk in newness of life. Of our bodies,
according to the words of the Apostle, Christus resurrexit, 1. Cor. 15. 20.
21. 22
etc. Christ is risen from the dead, and was made the first fruits of them
that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of
the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.
The sixth is, the bond of mutual fraternity and brotherhoode. For so the
Lord himself rising from the dead, speaks to the women by, Ascendo, etc. I
go up to my Father, and to your Father: my God, and your God. If therefore we
all have but one Father in common to us all, if we all are brothers and
sisters in Christ: it is meet, that like brothers and sisters we be all of
one mind, and tender one an other with brotherly affection and love. The
seventh is, a general remedy against all calamities, against all wounds or
sores of the soul, of the body, of our name and fame. Hereunto serves the
saying of the Apostle to Timothy, 2. Tim. 2. 8.
Memento, etc. Remember that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead: as if he
should have said, In this thy ministry and office thou shall feel many
distresses, thou shall suffer many temptatious of the Devil, and of men: but
in all these, take unto thee for thy succor and saftie, this notable Treacle,
namely, the meditating of the Lords resurrection: which as in the Lord
himself it was the victory over all temptations and afflictions: so likewise
in us it shall be the same victory, when we shall be raised up from the dead,
by the power of Christ's resurrection. The eight is, a perfect hope, or assured
persuasion of our glorious state and immortality. Saint Peter says, 1. Pet.
1. 3
Regenuit nos, etc. He has begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

The third point of this first member is, of the power whereby the Lord was
raised from the dead. Ioh. 10. 17.
Christ says, Potestatem habeo, etc. I have power to put away my life from me,
and to take it again. Now, in this place, God the Father is said to have
raised him up. In these words there is no contrariety of speech. Christ in
deed raised up himself, as God, that is to say, he raised up the nature of
his manhood, by the power of his Godhead: and the Father raised him up, as man.
To be short because the essence or being of the Father, the Son, and the
holy Ghost is all one, and the self same, as touching their divinity or
Godhead, their works are inseperable. Let these things suffice to be briefly
spoken, concerning the first member of this point: whereof in general there is
a double use: to wit, that we should be confirmed and established in the
knowledge of Christ's death and resurrection: and that we should prove and try
in our selves a lively and quick feeling of the same. In which sense S. Paul
speaks to the Romans, Romans 6. 4. 6, etc.
where he ascribes mortification and vivification (or for the better
understanding of the words, the making of us dead, and the making of us alive)
that is to say, newness of life, unto the Lords death and resurrection.

The second member now follows, whereof the Apostle speaks, saying: ( And
has set him at his right hand in the heavenly places.) This member contains
two Articles of our belief: the first is, The Lords ascending into Heaven: the
second is, his sitting at the right hand of God. For his ascending thither went
before his sitting there. Now, this ascending of the Lord was done visible.
For he was carried up into heaven in a bodily and natural manner from the
sight of his Disciples. For so it is said in the Acts, Cernentibus ipsis,
Acts. 1. 9.
etc. While they beheld, he was taken up: for a cloud took him up out of
their sight. And from thence was he carried above al heavens, and placed in
heavenly places, at the right hand of God his Father: as Saint Paul shows
in this place, and in the fourth Chapter following. The Article therefore of
the Lords ascending, ought to be understood of Christ's true and very body,
and of the natural placing thereof in heaven, least we should think, that
Christ's manhood was swallowed up of his Godhead, as Stenkfield dreamed: or that
it was extended and spread throughout all places with his Godhead, as the
heretic Eutyches doted. For both their opinions does take away the truth of
his humanity or manhood. The saying therefore of Saint Cyprian is to be
allowed, in these words: Ascendit in coelis, etc. He ascended into heaven, not
where God the word was not before: but where the word being made flesh sat not
before, to wit, in a bodily place. The sitting at the right hand of God his
Father, belongs to the power of ruling, wherein the son being equal with
his Father, does as it were part stakes, and possesses equal rule and
regiment with him. For the right hand of the Father, betokens a divine power,
majesty, and dominion. Wherefore, to sit at the right hand of the Father, is to
be equal with the Father in divine power, majesty, and dominion. And because
the Apostle makes mention of ( The right hand of the Father in heavenly
places,) he therefore gives us to note by the right hand of the Father, the
place of blessedness, happiness, and everlasting rest and quietness,
promised to all faithful believers, which place the body of Christ already
possesses.

But this is not against the saying of Christ, Matthew. 28. 20.
Ero vobiscum, etc. I will be with you every where, even to the end of the
world: neither does it take away the truth of the Lords body and blood in the
holy Supper. For Christ is all whole, wheresoever it is his will to be. More
of this matter, and that very learned and godly, is to be read in the
Commentaries of Philip Melancthon upon the first Chapter to the Colossians.

Furthermore the fruit of either article: namely, of the Lords ascending, and
of his sitting at the right hand of the Father, is declared at large in the
fourth Chapter following, Psa. 68. 18
where ye Apostle expounds this saying of the Psalmist, Ascendit in altum,
etc. He ascended up on high, he lead captivity captive, and gave gifts unto
men.

The third member is an exposition of the second. ( Far above all
principality, and power, and might, and domination, and every name that is
named, not in this world only, but also in that which is to come.) For in
these words the Apostle shows very notably, what Christ, sitting at the
right hand of his Father in heavenly places, is. For, by these words, the
Apostle means nothing else, than to signify Christ's rule, which is noted to
be exceeding great, as the Article of his sitting at his Fathers right hand
imports: and that he has no rule, either in this world, or in the world to
come, above that. Now, whereas Dionysius out of these words of the Apostle,
makes I wot not what orders of Angels, it is but weak. Neither is it to any
purpose to know, what orders of Angels, and what degrees of dignities are in
Heaven: seeing that the word of God shows no such thing unto us. Only let
this be enough for us to understand, That Angels are ministers: and (as in the
Epistle to the Hebrews is declared, ministering spirits ministers of the
Churches, Heb. 1. 14.
of Commonwealths, and of households in the world. Now, touching the words of
Saint Paul, this is worth the knowing, that he makes difference very trimly
of degrees in dignities by these four words, ( Principality, Power, Might,
and Domination.)

(...), Principality, signifies an order of the higher to the lower, from
whom obedience must proceed to the higher, as to the better. When therefore
the Apostle says, ( That Christ sits far above all Principality,) he
means, that Christ is Lord and King (...), that is, at no man's call or
command, to give a reckoning of his rule. For he has no Prince above him, to
whom he is compelled as a subject to be obedient, and to serve. For, as he is
of one and the self same nature with his Father touching his Godhead: so has
he equal rule with his Father. Heerehence let every faithful soul comfort
himself against the enemies of Christ, and against all principalities of the
world and of Hell: yea, let him make full account, that it shall one day come
to pass, that whatsoever is alofte, shall be brought down, and made subject,
(will they, nill they,) to the rule of Christ. Let no Christian therefore, if
he love godliness, become obedient, either to men or Devils, if they command
any thing that is against the laws of Jesus Christ our Prince.

(...), Power, betokens the right of ruling: which right is due to Christ,
for two reasons, First, in respect of his nature, as he is God, whereby he is
one and the same God with the Father and the Holy Ghost, to whom all things
are of right in subjection. Secondly, in consideration of the victory,
whereby he overcame the Devil our open adversary: so that Christ is above
all, by the right of ruling both ways.

(...), Might, notes the ableness of his rule, so that no force or puissance
can empaire his rule, or lessen it. Hereby faith has wherewith to encourage
it self, in temptations, and at the point of death, against all the assaults
of the Devil. For if the might of Christ does ouermaster all other manner of
mights, then there is no cause why the faithful should fear the gates of hell.

(...), Domination, has relation to all creatures, good and badde, whom Christ
is able to make couch and lie at his feet, by the virtue of his power: and can
constrain them, (will they, nill they,) to confess Christ their King and
Conqueror. Heerevpon it is written to the Romans, Romans 14. 11.
and to the Philippians, Quod omne genu, etc. That at the name of Jesus, every
knee should bow, both of things in Heaven, Phil. 2. 10.
and things in earth, and things under the earth, acknowledging his rule and
power. Hereunto Saint Paul adds the generality, saying: ( And above every
name that is named) that is to say, above every thing, which excels any
manner of way, whatsoever. The division which follows, ( Not in this world
only, but also in that which is to come,) is referred to the four former
members. For it imports thus much, That Christ is far above all things, not
only in this transitory world now present, but in the everlasting world
which is to come. The prerogative therefore or souereigntie of Christ, above
all principality, power, might, and domination, is not temporal, but
eternal: for it stretches out even to the world to come. There is no cause
therefore why the faithful should fear, least Christ being at any time
disgarded, and put beside his rule, they should suffer the injuries, and feel
the tyrannies of their enemies: or should be pressed down, and wrongfullie
kept under, with the rule of some new Lord succeeding.

The fifth member contains the largeness of his rule and kingdom. The
Apostle says, ( And has made all things subject under his feet.) For as
before, he was made the servant of all, that he might save man, who was lost
and cast away: so now, being made Conqueror, he has all things at his
commandment and service: insomuch that all things are forced to fall at his
feet, and to stand in awe of his government. Neither is this subjection proper
to his friends and household only: but pertains also to his enemies, to all
devils, and wicked men, insomuch that the very Devils themselves obeie Christ
with quaking and trembling. Heerehence has faith wherewith to strengthen it
self against all the gates of Hell. For faith must be ^^^suaded, and builded
upon this sure ground, that (...) much stronger, than that any can or dare
spoil him, and take any thing from him against his will.

The sixth member contains a certain singular form or manner of Christ's rule
and regiment, whereby he governs the Church of God. For the Apostle says) (
And has appointed him over all things, to be the head to the Church.) Now
whereas Christ is here said ( To be appointed of the Father the head to the
Church,) this does never a whit lessen or diminish the majesty of Christ,
whereby (according to his nature, as he is God,) he has rule over all things
with his Father. For Christ (as Gregory of Nice says) is said to take or
receive that as man, which he has naturally as God.

By this term Head, is signified, both that supremasie or sovereign rule of
Christ, which he alone has over the Church: and also the glory of the Church.
For, if Christ be the head, and the Church the body, then (no doubt) great is
the glory of the Church. For, where the head is, there is likewise the body.
For there is no middle place, whereby the head should be separated from the
body. Whosoever therefore (besides Jesus Christ alone) takes unto himself
this honor, and will be counted, called, and known the head of the Church, he
is a right Antichrist, and one which traiterouslie seeks to rob Christ of
his honor. As for that which the Popes mainteiners bring, who imagine that the
Church has two heads: the one governing, as principal: the other obeieng as
vassal: it is nothing. For the ministers of the Church of God, though some
have this degree of dignity, or place of preeminence: other some that, for the
better ordering of the Church: yet notwithstanding, all are ministers, neither
is one the others head, but fellow servants in the Lord. So Saint Paul
calls them which were ministers under him, Fellow servants, Col. 1. 7. and
4. 7. 9.
fellow soldiers, fellow workers of God, and brethren. Furthermore, Christ
is called ( The head of the Church,) Phil. 2. 25.
four ways. First, in power and force. For as the powers of man, 3. Ioh. 1. 2.
coming from the head, are conveyed throughout the whole body, by the veins
and sinews: so the faithful, what force soever they have, they receive it
from Christ. For, in that the faithful are mortified in the flesh, and
quickened in the spirit, they have that by the power of Christ's death and
resurrection, who is their head. For the power and virtue of Christ's death
keeps the flesh under in the believers: and by the efficacy and force of
Christ's life, a new spirit is begotten in man: whereby it comes to pass,
that he walks in newness of life. Secondly, Christ is called ( The head of
the Church) in perfection. For he alone deserves the praise of perfection in
the Church. For all virtues in him are most perfect, from whom certain beams
(as it were from the Sun) do shine and shoot upon the faithful. Thirdly,
Christ is called ( The head of the Church) in merit. For he alone in the Church
has merits, wherewith he merited and deserved for us the heavenly
inheritance. Fourthlie, Christ is called ( The head of the Church) in
dignity, order and authority. For he alone is the Monarch of the Church, and
a Prince at no man's controllment.

But least any should think, that S. Paul speaks, of Christ only, as of
the Prince of the Church, he adds a seventh member, and says: ( Of the
Church, which is his body.) Christ therefore is the head, and the Church his
body, to whom all efficacy force, and power flows from the head Here we
have to mark a very trim definition of the Church, whereby it is defined to
be ( The body of Christ,) not natural, but mystical. Of this body there are
two sorts of members: to wit, dead and living. They are dead members, who with
the outward assembly of the Church, and visible congregation make confession
of their faith, but yet are void of ye spirit of faith: such are Heretics,
Hypocrites, and carnal Gospellers. The living or lively members are they,
which being endued with a lively faith walk not after the flesh, but after the
spirit, whereby they are lead to be brief, whosoever do sincerely live in
Christianity, they are the lively members of Christ As for the Turks,
unbelieving Jews, and other Heathenish hearted people, they all are to be
reputed and thought neither lively nor dead members of the Church.

Moreover, when the Apostle says, ( Even the fulness of him, that fills all
in all things,) he shows why he calls the Church ( The body of Christ:)
and therewithal declares, how great the love of Christ is toward his Church:
which he calls ( The fullness of himself.) For, such is ye love of Christ
toward his Church, that although he perform all healthful things in all men:
yet notwithstanding, he thinks himself a head halt and lame, unless he have
ye Church as his body knit unto him. Heerevpon it follows, that Christ is
oftentimes taken for the whole Church together, joined unto her head, as when
it is said: 1. Cor. 12. 12. and. 13.
Sicut enim vnum corpus, etc. For as the body is one, and has many members,
and all the members of the body, which is one, though they be many, yet are
but one body: even so Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one
body: that is, that we might be made one body with Christ, that we might grow
into one body of Christ, that ye whole church might be nothing else but one
Christ: of which growing together, Baptism and the Lords supper are effectual
signs. Hereunto serves the saying of the Apostle, Abrahae dictae sunt, etc.
To Abraham and his seed were the promises made. Gal. 3. 16.
He says not, And to the seeds, as speaking of many: but, And to thy seed,
as of one, which is Christ. Here the Apostle calls Christ. ( The whole body
gathered together in one,) whose head and life Christ alone is: the members of
whom are the faithful, being partly Jews, and partly Gentiles. This he
concludes in the end of the Chapter more plainly in these words, Gal. 3. 28.
Omnes vos, etc. Ye are all one in Christ Jesus. Heerehence had these manner of
speeches their use and custom, To be made one with Christ, To be with Christ,
Christ to be in us, To be lead by the spirit of Christ, To be chosen in Christ,
To be called and justified in Christ, To live in Christ, To die with Christ, To
be crucified, buried, and rise again with Christ. Heereto also serves that
which follows in the third Chapter following, Ephesians. 3. 6.
That the Gospel was preached and revealed to the Gentiles, that they should
be inheritours also, and of the same body, and partakers of the promise in
Christ. Hereunto also pertains the words of Saint Paul to the Galathians,
Gal. 2. 20.
where he says, That he lives in Christ, and Christ in him. And to this also
belongs that speech of Christ: Acts. 9. 4.
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

Now, what have the faithful to gather hereby? Even to build their hope and
comfort upon this, that Christ cannot perish, of whom they are members by
faith. Heerby also have the faithful to succor and strengthen themselves, in
life, in death, and every danger: because they are assured that the time will
come, when Christ shall be glorified with his whole body: howsoever his members
amidst the hurly burlies of this world be contemned, and spitefully
ouertroden. But to the end we may know, that Christ of himself needs not
this fullness, the Apostle adds, ( That fills all, in all things.) For
indeed, if Christ fills and perfourmeth all in all things, then doubtless he
stands not in need of any man's help herein toward this fullness: but so
far forth as it pleases him, of his unmeasurable and bottomless bounty, to
vouchsafe ye Church to be joined unto him, as if it were his body. This place
likewise contains a plentiful testimony touching Christ's Godhead. For
seeing it does properly belong to the nature of God, ( To fill all in all
things:) and seeing this ability is here ascribed unto Christ, That he fills
all in all things:) it follows, that Christ is true God, and in person
infinite and eternal.

It is therefore well said in the Church: Christ is all in all every where,
Christ fills all in all, The son of the virgin is God. For these titles are
right well applied to his person, in respect of the nature of his Godhead, not
in respect of the nature of his manhood, which has his peculiar properties,
the taking away whereof, is the taking away of the truth of Christ's manhood,
and the overthrowing of the hope of our resurrection. Wherefore that saying of
S. Paul to the Philippians is thoroughly to be settled in memory, Phil. 3. 21.
Nostra corpora, etc. That our vile bodies shall be changed, and fashioned like
unto Christ's glorious body.

Now, if Christ's manhood were turned into his Godhead (as in times past the
Eutychians wickedlie maintained, and at this day Stenkfield traiterouslie
teaches,) there should remain for us no hope at all of our resurrection. Let
this suffice to be spoken of this part or parcel, wherein Saint Paul sets
forth the principal points of our faith concerning Christ, and very briefly
commends unto us the fruit of them therewithal.

OF PREDESTINATION.
NOw, for so much as there is often mention made of Predestination and Election
to everlasting life, in this Chapter, it seems a necessary labor unto me,
to add hereunto certain assertions or auouchments, which shall contain in
them the sum of the doctrine touching Predestination: which I have done, to
this purpose, that this doctrine, which is the ground work of our salvation,
may be the more manifest, and the thinking thereupon sweet and comfortable to
the godly Reader, when the circumstances of the same are duly considered.

I.
It is very needful, that the Church be instructed and taught thoroughly,
concerning the eternal Predestination and Election of men to the blisfull and
everlasting life. For as no doctrine can minister comfort more abundantly, to
true Christian consciences, than the doctrine of Predestination rightly
declared: so, nothing is more dangerous, than to swerve and straie from the
true mean and manner of Predestination.

II.
Wherefore, to the end we may not swerve and straie from the mean and manner
of Predestination and Election, which the Scripture commends unto us, there
must good heed be taken. For whosoever ouershooteth and misseth the mark
thereof, he is carried into a perilous breaknecke, whereout he cannot recover
himself, except he have succor from heaven.

III.
Some there are, which when they hear, that our salvation stands upon the
purpose and Election of God, neglecting the true mean and manner thereof,
imagine to themselves certain dreams of the Sto^kes, and tables of destiny:
wherewith they both entangle themselves miserably, and lead others out of the
way dangerously.

IIII.
For it cannot otherwise be, but that he which imagines books of destiny
and luck, whereby to learn and know who shall be saved, and who damned,
either swells with vain hypocrisy, or pineth away with dedlie desperation.

V.
For some, laieng fast hold upon a certain kind of fleshly carelessness,
run headlong with full liberty into all kind of mischief and villainy: to
themselves undoubted destruction, to others a grievous offense.

VI.
Othersome are carried into a contrary evil: who, whiles they dream of a
particular promise of grace, against the word of God, they are plunged over
head and ears, into the bottomless pit of despair: wherein they must needs
be cast alwaie for ever, unless the right hand of God, raising them up in
time, they earnestly repent.

VII.
Wherefore, seeing that we hear the mystery of Predestination commended unto
us in the word of God: it behooves us to seek the mean, the manner, and true
cause thereof in ye Oracle or word of God likewise: which if we have once
rightly learned, it shall fill us with erceeding great comfort, and shall be
unto us not only a spur to prick us forward to all exercises of godliness,
but also an assured anchor, whereupon to stay, even at the point of death.

VIII.
Now, the mean and manner of Predestination is most true, Ephe. 1. 4.
which S. Paul shows unto, us, when he writes thus to the Ephesians,
(Elegit, etc. He has chosen us in Christ, before the foundation of the world,
that we should be holy, Ephe. 1. 5.
and without blame before him in love.) Again, (Praedestinauit nos, etc. He
has predestined us, to be adopted, through Jesus Christ, unto himself.)
Again, Ephe. 1. 6. 7.
(Gratos nos, etc. He has made us accepted in his beloved, by whom we have
redemption through his blood. Ephe. 1. 9. 10.
( Again, Proposuit, etc. He has purposed to gather together in one, Ephe.
1. 11. 12.
all things in Christ.) Again, (In quo, etc. In whom also we are chosen, when
we were predestinate, according to the purpose of him, which works all
things, after the counsel of his own will, that we which first trusted in
Christ, should be unto the praise of his glory:) Ephe. 1. 13 14.
Again, (In quo, etc. In whom also ye have trusted, after that ye heard the
word of truth, even the Gospel of your salvation, wherein also, after that ye
believed, ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest
of our inheritance.)

IX.
Here Saint Paul most plainly declares the mean and manner of our
Predestination, whiles he says, that God has predestinate us to salvation by
and in Christ. By Christ, as our mediator and redeemer. In Christ, as in and
with our head: whose members we are made by faith, which the Gospel preaches
unto all people and persons indifferently.

X.
God therefore has predestinate us, not by registring our names in books of
destiny and fortune, as Zeno and his scholars doted: but by appointing and
ordeining an assured mean and manner of salvation by and in Christ, according
to the good pleasure of his will.

XI.
In this mean and manner the condition of faith is contained. For, when we are
graffed into Christ by faith, we are made members of his body: and therefore
are we called ( Elect and chosen) because we are the members of Christ.

XII.
Now, how necessary this condition is, by Gods good appointment, the
testimonies are many which declare it. S. Paul reasoning of Predestination,
Romans 9. 30 31. 32.
beats much upon this condition, saying: Quid igitur dicemus? etc. What shall
we say then? That the Gentiles which followed not righteousness, have
attained unto righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith? But
Israel. which followed the law of righteousness, could not attain unto the
law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as
it were, by the works of the law. Romans 10. 2 etc.
This condition likewise the Apostle rehearses in the tenth Chapter of the
same Epistle, and labors very much thereabout also elsewhere: Coloss. 1. 23.
as, Heb. 3. 6.
Si modo, etc. If ye continue grounded and stablished in the faith: 1. Tim. 2.
15.
Also, Participes, etc. Whose house we are, if we hold fast the confidence,
and the receiving of the hope unto the end: Again, Mulier, etc. The woman
shall be saved, if she continue in the faith.

XIII.
The Apostle shows the necessity of this condition, in his own person, 1.
Cor. 9. 16.
thus speaking of himself. Vae mihi, etc. Woe is me if I preach not the
Gospel. Again, Castigo, 1. Cor. 9. 27.
etc. I chastise my body, and bring it down in subjection, least while I
preach to other, I my self prove a castawaie. If therefore S. Paul, the
chosen vessel of God, duetifullie discharged his obedience toward God by
faith, then (no doubt) through the want of faith he had fallen from grace, and
through his own default, become a castawaie. To the same end drive the words
of the Prophet leremie, in the person of the Lord, saying: Si poenitentiam
egerit, Iere. 18. 8. 10.
etc. But if this nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their
wickedness, I will repent of the plague that I thought to bring upon them. But
if it do evil in my sight, and hear not my voice, I will repent of the good
that I thought to do for them.

XIIII.
Hereby plainly appears, that Gods predestination is ratified and confirmed
by and in Christ: and that therefore it requires at our hands the condition of
faith, whereby we are graffed into Christ, and so numbered among the chosen.

XV.
Upon the things which we have hitherto spoken, What Predestination is.
let us make this definition of Predestination: Predestination is the ordinance
of God, whereby he has appointed by and in Christ, before the foundation of
the world was laid, according to his good pleasure, and the counsel or
purpose of his will, all such to life everlasting, as should believe in Christ
their redeemer, that they might be holy and blameless before him, and that
they might magnify the praise of the glory of his grace, for ever and ever
world without end. The opposite or contrary to Predestination, is Reprobation,
whereby so many as care not for believing in Christ, and so many as continue
not in the faith of Christ to their lives end, are cut off from grace, banished
from everlasting life, and like bondslaues condemned to perpetual pains. The
cause of this reprobation is the sin of men, and the justice of God punishing
offenders, which foreslowe to flee for succor to the mercy seat, which God
has vouchsafed to set before men, in open sight.

XVI.
Furthermore, when we require the condition of faith, we do therewithal
reprove Pharisaicall error, touching the worthiness of persons, the
prerogative of flesh, the merits of men's works, etc. Whereupon this also
follows, That we must not judge of this great mystery, either after reason,
or according to the law. For, as reason seems to make the worthiness of
persons, and the prerogative of flesh, the cause of election: so the law
likewise seems unto Hypocrites, (but yet amiss) to make the merits of works
the cause of election.

XVII.
The cause therefore of our predestination is not in us, as the Monks thought,
who were far wide, but in God: which cause the Apostle calls ((...), Ephe.
1. 5.
voluntas Dei, The good pleasure of Gods will,) And S. Augustine,
Misericordissimam Dei voluntatem, The most merciful will of God. Of this will
of God toward men, when we are well warranted, and certeinlie assured, then
have we an immovable foundation of our predestination. For ( God works all
things, Ephe. 1. 11
after the counsel of his own will,) as Saint Paul witnesses.

XVIII.
The most merciful will of God, is not unknown, or hidden from us: but
delivered and opened by the voice or sound of the Gospel: and in four things
chiefly it is to be seen: namely, In the sending of his son, In the promise,
In the commandment, and In the sealing of grace.

XIX.
This sending of the son, is a substantial testimony of Gods fatherly will
toward us, according to this saying of the son: John. 3. 16
Sic Deus, etc. So God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son,
1. Ioh. 4. 9
that as many as believe in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Romans 5. 8.
And again, Commendat Deus, etc. God sets out his love toward us, seeing
that whiles we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. The price therefore which
he paid down, is a sufficient amends for the misdeedes of the world. For the
Father himself confesses, That in his son he is well pleased, Mat. 17. 5
and bids us boldly hear him.

XX.
No man has to think, that the son was sent into the world, to redeem a
certain number, put a part from the rest of mankind only: but rather, to take
away the sins of the whole world, according to that saying: Ecce agnus, John.
1. 29 36.
etc. Behold the lamb of God, which takes away the sins of the world. For, as
he took upon him ye nature common to us all, so with our nature, he took
likewise our cause. For so he says openly of himself, Filius hominis, Math.
18. 11.
etc. The son of man came to save that which was lost. Now, there were not a
few handfuls of mankind lost, but all mankind, one with an other. As therefore
in Adam we all fell: 1. Cor. 15. 22.
so the promise of the seed which should bruise the serpents head, is given to
all Adams offspring. 1. Ioh. 3. 8.
Heerevpon says S. John, Christus apparuit, etc. Christ appeared, to destroy
the works of the Devil. Wherefore (as S. Paul says, 1. Tim. 1. 15.
) Fidelis hic sermo, etc. This is a true saying, and by all means, worthy to
be received, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

XXI.
Now, in that the success (the more pity) is not answerable to the fathers
will, who sent his son: nor to the desire of the son, who suffered
punishment for man's sin: that proceeds from their own malice and wilfulnes:
for that they being bidden of a most merciful and gentle father, to the
marriage of his best beloved son, and might be welcome guests, cared not for
coming, but unthankfully set at naught his kindness: as Christ himself
complains, Math. 20. 16, and. 22. 14.
saying: Multi sunt vocati, etc. Many are called, but few are chosen: that is
to say, Few believe and bring forth fruits worthy of repentance. This is
the cause why they are shut out of the Bridehouse, as guests not garnished with
a wedding garment.

XXII.
THE PROMISE OF GRACE, which in deed stretches unto all, does likewise
commend unto us the most merciful will of our heavenly father. Hereunto serve
many saiengs, and among the rest these which follow. Haec est voluntas, etc.
This is the will of my Father, John. 6. 40
which sent me, that (all) which see the son, and believe in him, Mat. 18.
14.
should have life everlasting. Again, Sic non est, etc. So is it not the will
of your Father which is in heaven, that (one) of these little ones should
perish. Again, 1. Tim. 2. 4
Deus vult, etc. It is the will of God, that (all) should be saved, 2. Pet. 3.
9.
and come unto the knowledge of the truth. Ezekiel. 18. 23. 32.
Again, Deus longanimis, etc. God is patient and long suffering toward us,
and would have (no man) to perish, but would (all men) to come to repentance.
To this also pertains that place of the Prophet, Nolo mortem, etc. I will not
the death of a sinner: but that he repent and live. Heerevpon says Saint
Barnard, Prodit in lucem, etc. The great counsel, which from the everlasting,
lay hid in the bosom of euerlastingnesse, is come abroad in light, for the
comfort of the miserable and distressed: because God will not the death of a
sinner, but rather that he should repent and live.

XXIII.
This promise of grace, as it reaches unto all, so is it also freely given,
and is to be received by faith alone. The Apostle most plainly avouches both,
in the 9. 10. and 11. Chapters of his Epistle to the Romans: where he aloweth
no place at all to the prerogative of the flesh, Esai. 28. 16
nor to the merits of works, Joel. 2. 32.
and concludes, that ( Whosoever believes, Acts. 2. 21
shall not be put to shame. For (says he) there is no difference of the Jew
and the Gentile. Romans 10. 11. 12.
For the same Lord of all, Romans 9. 33
is rich unto all that call upon him.

XXIIII.
Heereto serve those notable figures, which the same Apostle sets forth,
when he brings in Ismael and Isaach, the two sons of Abraham: and Jacob and
Esau, the two sons of Isaach. Which figures are thus to be applied. In
assured blessings and benefits belonging to this life, not all which are borne
of Abraham's and Isaachs seed, are counted their children: much less in
spiritual things shall they be taken for their children, which come of the
loins of these holy Fathers. Wherefore, as in the blessings or benefits
belonging to this life, they only are reputed the children of the holy
Patriarchs, concerning whom they had promises: (as Abraham of Isaach, and not
of Ismael: Isaach of Jacob, and not of Esau:) even so in spiritual things,
they only are to be accounted Abraham's children, which believe in the free
promise, and not they which swell and are proud of the prerogative of the flesh.

XXV.
As for the Apostles conclusion, it has none other meaning: Romans 9. 16
Non est igitur, etc, It is not therefore in him which wills, nor in him
which runs, but in God which has mercy. Of which conclusion, this is the
true and perfect meaning without doubt. It is not in him which wills, nor in
him which runs, to wit, according to the flesh: because the will of the
flesh, and the running of the flesh, stay upon the prerogative of the flesh,
and the merits of works: and therefore they are flat against the mercy of
God, and the merit of Christ. But it is in him that wills, and in him that
runs, according to the promise, that is to say, of him which believes:
because, All things are possible to him that believes. Mark. 9. 23
For this will, and this running commend the mercy of God, and rest only
upon the mercy promised in Christ. What follows heerevpon? Even that which
the Apostle has set down: namely, That the children of the promise, and not
the children of the flesh are heirs.

XXVI.
Now, who are the children of the promise? Forsooth, as many as believe in the
promise, as Abraham did believe. For the Apostle names them the children of
the promise, Romans 4. 12
Qui insistunt; etc. Which walk in the steps of Abraham's faith. And he says
yet again, Scitote, etc. Know you therefore, that they which are of faith,
the same are the children of Abraham. Gal. 3. 7.
If they be children, then are they also heirs, according to the promise.

XXVII.
They which deny this grace of God reaching unto all, (so much as belongs to
the fatherly will of God,) besides that they set themselves against Saint
Paul, and heave and shoue to shake in sunder the consent of the whole
scripture, they offend most grieuouslie otherwise. For, first of all, they make
God a respecter of persons: and again, they imagine in God two contrary
wills.

XXVIII.
But that God is no respecter of persons, there are many places of scripture
which give manifest proof. For God does always allow the good cause, and
evermore condemns the evil cause: according to this rule, Fideles, etc. Psa.
31. 23
The Lord keeps the faithful, as for the proud, he will pay them their
hire. Nothing therefore is more certain, than that God receives the repentaunt
to grace and favor: contrariwise, that he gives over the unrepentant,
setting apart all respect of persons.

XXIX.
Now, Two faithful persons, the one a beggar, the other a Lord. etc.
whereas it pleased Gods will, that Lazarus should beg, and that Joseph
should be a Lord or Prince in Egypt: this does not prove that God has any
respect of persons. For the having of respect of persons has place in
judgments, where equal things are given to unequal persons: and unequal
things to equal persons. Now, seeing that God reckons still upon this rule
of judgment, That he would save ( all) that believe in Christ, and punish with
everlasting pains, ( all) such as set light by his son, and lie soaking in
their sins, there is (I think) no respect of persons in God.

XXX.
Furthermore, that there are not in God contrary wills, hereby it is manifest:
because, as he is most true: yea, even truth it self, so he cannot away with a
double heart, but utterly condemns it. Whereas therefore it is thus written,
God will that (all men) be saved: Again, God will that (none) perish, but that
(all) repent: the contradictories of these propositions, are at no hand to be
allowed, which are these: God will that ( not all men) be saved: God will that
( some) perish, and that ( not all) repent.

XXXI.
How then comes it to pass (thou will say) that many are damned, seeing God
will have ( all) saved? If we have an eye to the purpose of God in our
creation, and of sending his son into the world, then we shall see indeed
that the will of God is, that ( none) should perish. But if we look again to
the event or success, we shall see that the will of God is, that ( all)
unrepentant, ( all) wilful, stubborn, and maliciously minded persons shall
perish. An earthly father would gladly have all his children inherit: for
this is the true fatherly love in a good father after the flesh. But if he
perceive any of his children so froward, unruly, disordered, and disobedient,
that neither rebukes with words, nor the smart of the whip, or such like sharp
correction will make him amend, the wise father puts him by his
inheritance, and reckons him no more in the number of his children.

XXXII.
Of this thing we have a pattern before us in Deuteronomie, Deuteronomy. 21. 18. 19.
20. 21.
where the Lord says thus: Si genueris, etc. If any man have a son that is
stubborn and disobedient, which will not hearken unto the voice of his father,
nor the voice of his mother, and they have chastened him, and he would not
obeie them: Then shall his father and his mother take him, and bring him out
unto the Elders of his city, and unto the gate of the place where he dwells,
and shall say unto the Elders of his city: Filius noster iste, etc. This our
son is stubborn and disobedient, and he will not obeie our admonition: he is
a riottour, and a drunkard. Then all the men of his city shall take him, and
stone him with stones unto death, etc. Will not the Father here have his son
stoned with stones even to death, though nature should move him fatherly to
love him? After the same manner deals God. For God, of his fatherly
goodness, would have (all) made heirs of everlasting life: but yet
notwithstanding, he has appointed the stubborn and obstinate their portion,
even perpetual punishment.

XXXIII.
Wherefore we must heedefullie make a difference between the fatherly will of
God, which the Divines call, ( Antecedent: that is, going before,) and that
will of his which follows the wilful stubbornness of men, which is also
called ( Consequent: that is, following after.)

XXXIIII.
The commandment (for this is the third thing, wherein we have set forth the
will of God toward all men) commends likewise unto us, the true fatherly
will of God toward all. For it cannot be, that the will of God should wrestle
with his commandment. Wherefore, when he bids the whole world hear his
son, his will doubtless is, that all should hear him, and his will is by
hearing they should have faith. For the preaching of the Gospel requires
says. Gods will also is, that such as believe should be saved. Besides this,
the son, who is the wisdom of his Father, sends out his Disciples
throughout the whole world, with this commandment, Ite in mundum, Luke. 16.
15. 16.
etc. Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel unto (every creature.)
He that shall believe and be baptized, shall be saved: but he that will not
believe, shall be damned. This commandment, for so much as it reaches unto all,
plainly proves, that Gods will is to have ( all men) saved: but yet upon the
condition of faith, as the promise joined to the commandment declares. The
Lord straineth his voice, crieng: Venite, etc. Come unto me all ye that are
weary and laden, Math. 11. 28.
and I will ease you. Here do both: namely, the commandment and the promise
testify, that the will of God is fatherly, that ( all) should come to Christ
calling them, and that ( all) should obtain in him their salvation.

XXXV.
This therefore is boldly and undoubtedly to be built upon, that the eternal
and universal commandment of God, is an undeceivable witness of his will
toward all men. Seeing therefore he commands all to hear his son, and to
believe in him: his will surely is thereafter, that all should hear, that all
should believe, that all should be justified, that all should be sanctified,
and that all should be saved. Be it far from a Christian heart to think,
that God forgiueth all men outwardly and in words: and has an other will and
secret meaning of his own inwardly.

XXXVI.
But one or other will say peradventure: Faith is the gift of God, and the
work of the holy Ghost: Ergo, no man can believe, but he which receives
faith from above. Ioh. 6. 44.
Again, No man comes to the son, unless the Father draw him. This (I
grant) is very true. But when Saint Paul says, Faith comes by hearing,
Romans 10. 17.
and hearing by the word of God, he means that the preaching of the Gospel
is the ordinary instrument to obtain faith: wherein God (according to his
promises) will be faithful and effectual, and will draw and knit us unto his
son by the word and the spirit. But many, when God draws them, set
shoulder against him, whom they may as well (I wisse) obeie. This is plainly
proved by the complaint of Christ, lamenting and weeping over the Jews, Math.
23. 37.
for their frowardness: Quoties volui, etc. How often would I have gathered
thee together, Luke. 13. 35.
as the hen gathers her chickens, and thou would not? The like
stubbornness, and wilful obstinacy, Saint Stephen casts in the teeth of the
Jews in his time, Act. 7. 51
saying: Duri ce^uice, etc. Ye stiffenecked and of uncircumcised hearts and
ears, ye have always resisted the holy Ghost. And the Lord by his Prophet
Esaie says, Esaie. 56. 2. 3. etc.
Tota die, etc. I have stretched out my hands all the day long, to a stubborn
people that have resisted me. Acts. 13. 45. 46. 47.
By this self same testimony of authority, Saint Paul shows the rebellion
of the Jews, which he proves to be the cause of their casting off. And
although our mind, whiles it is enlightened, prepared, altered, changed,
disposed and ordered, is the patient or sufferer: yet notwithstanding, in
respect of consent and agreement, our will being taught by the word, and
strengthened by the holy spirit, is the agent also or dooer.

XXXVII.
Hereunto serves the example which Saint Augustine sets down, of
Nabuchodonosor and Pharao, in these words: Quantum ad, etc. In respect of their
nature, they were both men: in respect of their dignity, both Kings: in
respect of their cause, both keepers of Gods people in captivity: in respect
of their punishment, both gently admonished and warned by chastisements. What
then made their endings diverse? Forsooth this, because the one feeling Gods
hand, mourned in the remembrance of his own sin and iniquity: the other
wrestled with free will against the most merciful good pleasure of God.

XXXVIII.
But here special heed must be taken, least any through wantonness and
long custom of sinning, abusing the gentleness and long suffering of God,
calling them to repentance, purchase unto themselves Gods heavy judgment
that in his wrath he forsake them, and give them over into a reprobate mind.
When this is come to pass, men wax deaf, and hard of hearing the word of
God, drawing to themselves such a use and necessity of sinning, by their own
will, that they can do nothing else but sin. For it fares with them, as
with him, that pitcheth himself headlong from the top of a steep hill,
which deed being once done, there is no calling of it back again, because it
is past recovery.

XXXIX.
We must therefore in time obeie the voice of God calling us, we must repent
and walk warily (as the Prophet gives us counsel) before our God. For, he
that refuses to hear God, calling us by his ministers, runs with full
rain, into the punishment of wilful obstinacy: whereupon follows, that he,
being more and more fast bound with the chains of sin, till at length he
become senseless and sorowlesse, and so turn topsie torue all the means of
salvation. Here therefore that common verse has fit place:

If thou to day unmeet be thought,
To morrow doubtless much more naught.
XL.
The sealing of grace commends unto us most manifestly, the fatherly will
of God: for this follows in the fourth place among those marks and tokens,
which set before our eyes, how fatherly the will of God is toward all men.
For, whiles he bids ( all nations) to be baptized, he will also (no doubt)
that his grace and most merciful will be sealed unto ( all nations.) For he
would never call ( all nations) to Baptism, but that his will is to give
salvation to ( all nations) which he seals with Baptism. For this is an
immovable sequel. God offers salvation unto ( all:) Ergo his will is that (
all) be saved.

XLI.
Now in that Baptism is but only literal in many, this comes not to
pass by the counsel and will of God, who gives his grace truly, and
seals the same in deed by Baptism: but through the default of men, who
shrink shamefullie from the covenant which they made with God in Baptism.

XLII.
For, as God promises, and seals his promise with Baptism: so it is meet
that man, on the other side, have faith in this behalf. For, in every
covenant, either party must and shall keep the conditions and appointments of
the covenant. And for that cause S. Peter defines it, A good conscience making
request to God. 1. Pet. ^ 21.
For God in giving Baptism, promises grace: now, a conscience in faith
agreeable, rests upon the covenant, being well assured of Jesus Christ's
resurrection.

XLIII.
Seeing therefore these proofs do most plainly lay before us the fatherly
will of God, which is the cause and groundworke of our Predestination and
election, requisite it is that we have a steadfast belief of our salvation, and
that we betake our selves to the fatherly will of God (as to a most strong and
well fensed tower) expressed and showed unto us, In the sending of his son,
In the promise, I^ the commandment, and in the sealing of grace: not passing
a point for the opinions and decrees of the Stoikes, touching Fortune or
destiny, though they have iollie wise fellows for their maintainers.

XLIIII.
Furthermore, Saint Paul makes two ends of our predestination and election,
writing to the Ephesians: whereof the first is, ( That we should be holy, and
without blame before him, that is to say, that we should give our selves to
holiness and harmelesnesse, and should always have before us a good mind,
purpose, and honest endeavor: the last, ( That the glory of his grace might
be praised of us for ever.)

XLV.
It remains now, that we speak somewhat of the use of the most sweet
doctrine of Predestination and Election, which is of two sorts, as may be
gathered out of Saint Paul's Epistles to the Romans and Ephesians. The Apostle
therefore writes to the Romans concerning Predestination, that he might
conclude out of the cause, the manner and mean, and the condition also of
Predestination, that the prerogative of the flesh; and man's merits, are no
kind of cause of salvation. The Apostle therefore overthrows the prerogative
of the flesh, and all merits of men, that the mercy of God in Christ Jesus,
might take place, and that a way of salvation may be made unto all such as
refuse not to believe in Christ. In his Epistle to the Ephesians, he has the
same matter in hand, to the end he might show, that the Gospel of Christ, is
no new vpstart doctrine, set abroch of the Apostles: but that the same was laid
up and kept in the bosom of God himself, before the world was made, and in
due time opened and delivered to the world.

XLVI.
Besides this double use; whereof the first serves to confirm righteousness
freely given, and grace stretched out and offered unto all: the last, to
commend the ancientnesse of the Gospel: there is yet an other use, (which
Saint Paul touches in his Epistle to the Romans) That the godly may be
bold, Romans 8. 33 34. 35. etc.
that no cross, no affliction, no misery: to be short, nothing whatsoever is
able to hinder or let the salvation of the believers, which is builded upon the
eternal ordinance of God.

XLVII.
From hence springs an exceeding great comfort in the agony of death, and
an unspeakable reioising: insomuch, that the party which lies gasping, and
drawing to his long home, may say, as it were in triumph: In Domino, etc.
Psalm. 57. 10
My soul trusts in the Lord, I will not be afraid. My Christ is the
vanquisher of death, in him will I triumph.

XLVIIII.
Hereunto serves that saying of the Prophet David, Psalm. 27. 14.
V^riliter agite, etc. I lay the men, be constant, and let the hearts of all
you, Psalm. 31. 23, and. 24
which hope in the Lord, be strengthened. For the Lord keeps all them that
love him.

XLIX.
To stay here: this use which confirms us in any kind of cross, and
comfort us in the agony of death, then indeed enters his room, when we
feel that we are in Christ, and that Christ is in us.

L.
Wherefore, according to Saint Paul's advise, we must take a trial of our
selves, Vos ipsos tentate, etc. Prove your selves ( says he) whether ye are
in the faith: 2. Cor. 13. 5.
examine your selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is
in you?

LI.
These words of the Apostle teach us a most certain and assured manner of
trieng our selves, which is, to prove and examine, whether we are in the faith,
and whether Christ dwells in us. Which proving doubtless) cannot from
elsewhere proceed, than from the effects and working of Christ's spirit. For
they that are lead by Christ's spirit, are his: and they that are lead by
Christ's spirit, think, love, follow, and exercise in life, the things that
are of Christ, esteeming nothing more precious, than so to order and frame
their lives, as that God should like well and allow of them. Heerevpon arises
that sharp combat of the spirit against the flesh, never ceassing in the
godly.

LII.
To this also belongs the saying of Saint Paul, 1. Tim. 1. 18. 19.
Milita, etc. Fight a good fight, keep the faith, and a good conscience. For
these are most assured testimonies that Christ dwells in us. For Where faith
is, there the conscience is cleansed from all dead works. Wherefore, both a
good conscience, and a godly purpose are undoubted warrants of a sincere
faith. Contrariwise, where the conscience is beesmeared with sin, and an
evil purpose of doing amiss, there is no faith at all, but a kind of
Hypocritical bragging of faith peradventure, which to be most vain and
foolish, the works themselves springing from the same, do sufficiently
declare, and Saint James also says no less.

THE SECOND CHAPTER.
THE SVMME OF THE SEcond Chapter.
IT pleased God to quicken and make alive in Christ, by grace through faith,
not the Jews only, a people dead to sin, and the children of wrath: but
also the Gentiles, which in times past were not of Gods household: taking away
all difference betwixt the Jews and the Gentiles, and making peace betwixt
them both: which he has done to this end, that he might show unto all ages and
posterities his plentiful and everlasting grace toward the faithful, who are
builded upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Christ being the
corner stone. Or thus more briefly: God vouchsafes to take the Jews and the
Gentiles, great sinners, to grace and favor, for his sons sake Christ Jesus.

THE ORDER OF THE SEcond Chapter.
THe beginning of this Chapter does fitly agree with the end of the Chapter
going before. For the Apostle here applies a general doctrine to the Jews
and the Gentiles: that is to say, turns over the generality, to the
specialties. For, in this Chapter he repeateth in particular, that which in
the former Chapter he set down in general: howbeit, in an other form and
manner of speech, for the more approving of the matter, and giving of it
greater force. Now he uses a comparison of the state of man, which is of two
sorts: namely, of the former, to wit, before grace: and of the latter: that
is, under grace. Before grace, men were dead in their tra^sgressions and sins,
under grace they were quickened and made alive by Christ, through faith. This
comparison first of all, as in the proposition, he applies unto them both:
afterward, he turns it both to the Jews, and also to the Ephesians: adding
thereunto a certain short Aphorism, wherein he lays wide open the sum of
salvation. Then he applies the same comparison more at large to the Gentiles,
under the name of the Ephesians: declaring how the Gentiles, who in times past
were strangers from the Commonwelth of God, are made Citizens with the Saints,
and of Gods household: all which is wrought by the cross of Christ, the virtue
and power whereof is made known unto men, by the preaching of the Gospel.
Lastly, he ioineth heerewithall a conclusion, with a notable enlargement. All
these things tend wholly hereunto, that the Ephesians might esteem and think
of the grace of the Gospel, according to the worthiness thereof, least they
being made partakers of so heavenly a mystery, should unadvisedly fall away
from it again.

THE EXPOSITION OF THE SEcond Chapter, with the observation of doctrines
therein contained.
Verse. 1. and. 2.
1 And you has he quickened, that were dead in trespasses and sins.

2 Wherein in time past, ye vvalked, according to the course of this world,
and after the Prince that rules in the air, even the spirit, that now
works in the children of disobedience.

And you when you were dead in the trespasses and sins wherein you walked,
according to the trade of this world, after the Prince that rules in the air,
even the spirit, which now works in the children of unbelief. ALthough the
words of this speech or sentence, stand out of order: yet notwithstanding
there is no disorder of matter. Wherefore, to the intent it may be perfect and
full, the Nominative case and the Verb, must be fetched out of the words which
follow, after this manner, ( God the Father has quickened you together with
Christ, when you were dead in sins.) Now let us weie the sentence well. In
the end of the former Chapter, the Apostle calls Christ, ( The head of the
Church:) and here he places the Ephesians under Christ the head, that they
might advisedly consider, to how great dignity and glory they are called, by
the gospel. Now, yt this passing great benefit might become more sweet to the
Ephesians, he sets down a comparison of a double state, common to the Jews
and the Ephesians, that is to say, the Gentiles. The former state is of them
both before their conversion: the latter after their conversion. Before their
conversion, S. Paul avouches, that they both were dead in trespasses and
sins. After their conversion, he says, that they were discharged from the
guiltiness of their sins, and were quickened in Christ. By ( Trespasses)
understand the beginnings as it were of sins: and by ( Sins) the custom of
sinning. And that the Ephesians were dead in trespasses and sins; before
their conversion, he proves by two reasons. For, he sends them both to
experience or proof, and also to the cause and Prince of all evil and
mischief. Experience would not suffer them to be ignorant, how defiled and
unclean they were ( According to the course of the whole world,) being
indeed plunged over head and ears in the bottomless pit of sins. For (
According to the course of this world,) signifies the trade, fashion, custom,
and use of this world, which delights in nothing else but in sins.

They are not said, in this place, ( To be dead in trespasses and sins)
whose sin i^^^ut out: but they whom sin has wounded and slain, as guilty
before the judgment seat of God. The Apostle speaks of spiritual death,
which is a separation of Gods spirit and grace from man. From whence also yt
death, which we call the first death: to wit, the departing of the soul from
the body: and the second death, which is death everlasting do proceed. Let
us now see what doctrine is ministered unto us out of this place.

First, we learn heerehence, that men destitute of Gods grace, can do nothing
else but sin, in every thing that they take in hand. Secondly, that Satan
has full swaie in the children of unbelief: that is to say, in them which
believe not the Gospel. Thirdly, that the life and conversation of men, is a
testimony and witness, by what spirit they are lead, whether by the spirit of
God, or the spirit of the Devil. Fourthlie, that such as believe in Christ,
are set free from the tyranny of Satan, that he has no power over them, to
egg them, as he list, to this sin and that.

There are two causes of sins noted here, to wit, ( The course of this
world,) and ( The Prince that rules in the air.) But of these I will speak
hereafter, when I shall join unto these, other causes also, as the words of
the Apostle shall move me: to the end we may have all the causes of sins in
the unbelievers noted together; and so with the greater diligence take heed of
them.

Verse. 3.
3 Among vhom we also had our conversation in time past, in the lusts of our
flesh, in fulfilling the will of the flesh, and of the mind: and were by
nature the children of wrath, as well as others. Among whom likewise all we
were sometimes conversant, in the concupiscence of our flesh, doing the will
of the flesh, and of the mind, and we were by nature the children of wrath as
well as others. THis is spoken by way of application, and serves to this end,
that the Ephesians looking upon the Jews, as upon a pattern or example, might
hope well. For, seeing ye Apostle says, That the Jews were no less given to
the lewd lusts of the flesh, and unto doing the will of their wicked thoughts,
whereby they became the children of wrath, by the like corruption of nature
which reigned in the rest, than the Ephesians or other Gentiles, and yet
affirms that they were taken to grace, and received into favor, it puts
the Ephesians in good hope and comfort, that they should be received into
favor also, and be saved, through the self same goodness of God.

Heerehence let us learn the use of such examples as the holy scripture
commends unto us. For they (to speak briefly) besides the doctrine which is
to be gathered by them, set before our eyes, Gods judgment and his mercy,
that we might be instructed and taught, having such godly examples of them
both, in present view.

( The lust of the flesh) is that, which springs from the corruption and
naughtiness of the flesh, that is, of original sin. For here this word (
Flesh) signifies the whole man not yet renewed. In the ( Flesh) dwells (
Lust,) whereby man is egged to do those things, which the flesh and the wicked
thoughts of the same do like. The Apostle in this place seems to make two
parts of a corrupt and naughty nature, to wit: (...): that is to say: the
flesh, and the mind, or the understanding part. By the first is meant that
part of the mind, which the Philosophers call, (...), the appetite, or desire,
which is void of reason. By the last, that part which they name, (...), the
reasonable part. Whereupon it comes to pass, that the whole man, before the
grace of regeneration, is by nature, that is to say, not by custom and
imitation, but by necessity of birth and conception, after the fall of our
first parents, the child of wrath, that is to say, by the just judgment of
God, angry and displeased with him, guilty of everlasting death, through
sin. For the child of wrath is Passiuelie taken, and not Actiuelie. For, he
is not here said to be the child of wrath, which is angry: but he which
suffers anger by desert, and therefore is appointed unto punishment. Also
before, the child of wilfulness and stubbornness is Actiuelie taken: for it
signifies one that is froward, malicious, disordered, and a wrestler against
the word of God and his will. It is to be noted therefore, that this word
Filius, Child, joined with Genitive cases of Nownes appellatiues, is sometimes
Actiuelie taken, that is to say: signifies a man given to that property or
quality, which by the Genitive case is expressed: and other sometimes again,
it is Passiuelie taken, that is to say, signifies him that is made subject to
suffer that thing which the Genitive case declares. In this place let us first
of all mark, how miserable our state and condition is without Christ. For, we
are carried a maine into all kind of sin and wickedness, even as the lust of
the flesh moves us, and not only summoned, but also tried and found guilty
before Gods judgment seat, as offenders deserving the wrath of God, and
eternal death. Let this thinking upon our evil case admonish us, how sweet
the Lord is, and how comfortable his word, who by his grace delivers us out
of these dangers, and remoueth us into his glorious kingdom. Besides that we
have said, by this and the former part we may gather the causes of sins
bearing full swaie in the world, which keep order in following one another.

The first is the flesh it self. Now this word ( Flesh) is diversely taken in
the Scripture. For, sometimes it has a proper, and sometimes again a
figurative or borrowed meaning. When it is properly taken, it signifies the
fleshie substance of living creatures: as when Saint Paul says thus, 1. Cor.
15. 39.
Non omnis caro eadem, etc. All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one
flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another
of birds. It is figuratiuelie taken also, sometimes by the figure Synecdoche,
and signifies the whole man, 1. Cor. 1. 29.
as in that place of Saint Paul, Vt non, etc. That all flesh may not boast,
that is to say, man or any other living creature: as in that place also of
Genesis, Finis, Genesis 6. 13.
etc. An end of all flesh is come before me. Sometimes by the figure
Metaphora: for as the flesh does properly signify, a thing sensible, which
may be fealt and seen: so Metaphoricallie it signifies the outward show or
appearaunce of things: as in that place, where it is said: Ioh. 8. 15.
Vos iudicatis, etc. Ye judge after the flesh. Sometimes by the figure
Metalepsis: for, because the flesh is soft, it is otherwhiles taken for soft,
and set against hardness: as in that saying of the Lord, Auferam, etc. I will
take from their flesh, Ezekiel. 11. 19. and cap. 36. 26
their stony heart: and I will give them a fleshie heart: that is to say, a
soft heart, not resisting God, but believing in the word of God. Sometimes by
the figure Metonymia, for something to him belonging, and that diversely:
otherwhiles for the judgment of reason, Math. 16. 17.
as in that saying, Caro and sanguis, etc. Flesh and blood, has not opened
this unto thee, that is to say, by the judgment of reason thou perceiuest
not, that I am the Son of God, and the true Messiah. Sometimes for the
beginning of man's corrupt nature: that is to say, for original sin, as in
Saint Paul's Epistles every where may be seen: Romans 8. 6.
(...): that is to say, The wisdom of the flesh is death. Romans 8. 13
Again, Si secundum, etc. If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. And in
that speech of the Lord, Quod natum est, Ioh. 3. 6.
etc. That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh. And in this sense is the word
( Flesh) taken, when we make it the first cause of sins, reigning and ruling
among men. Against this is set, as it were flat contrary, the spirit of the
newborn: that is to say, a motion or working, which the holy spirit
stirs up in the hearts of the believers, which is the first cause of godly
purposes and exercises in men.

The second cause of sins swaieng in such sort, is the lust of the flesh,
whereby the flesh, or original sin is made lusty and effectual to bring
forth very ill fruits. The force of this lust all men feel and try in
themselves. Against this is set, as flat contrary, the lust of the spirit,
which has place only in the godly, and in such as have changed their copy
by repentance: and this is the second cause of godly purposes and exercises
in the good.

The third cause of trespasses and sins is the understanding, or (as Saint
Paul says) (...): that is, the mind: when the mind or understanding being
attainted, and raised up of lust, begins to talk and reason with it self
of those things, whereunto the lust moves and pricketh it. Against this is set
(as flat contrary) the understanding of the spirit.

The fourth cause of sins and offenses is, the will of the flesh, and
thoughts of the same: as Saint Paul says. And although the will sometimes
replieth upon the reasoning of the flesh: yet notwithstanding, in them that are
not newborn, it is violently carried away (yea very often) with the force of
the flesh: even as a Pinnisse or small Bark is with contrary winds and
weather, though the mariners do what they can for the safeguard of the same.
Heereto serves the saying of Medea: Laudo ^^^liora, etc.

The better I allow as true,
But yet the worst I will ensue.
Against this will of the flesh, and the thoughts of the same, is set (as flat
contrary) the will of the spirit, commanding things, which the flesh can in no
wise away with: and this is the fourth cause of godly purposes and actions in
the good.

The fifth cause of sins is, (as Saint Paul says,) (...), The common course
of this world: that is to say, the perverse and froward fashions of this
world, infinite offenses daily given, and examples of most mischievous deeds
without number. This evil custom of the world, is a kind of fodder and
sustenaunce of sin: wherewith many among them that were minded to fear God,
being fed fat, ware wild, and kick up the heel against him. Heerehence
springs this, that the evil manners of parents, is ths evil bringing up of
their children. For, whiles men do amiss, and live after the manner of the
multitude, they excuse themselves by example, as they in old time did, who
setting good Noe at naught, were paid home at length, feeling in the flood due
punishment for their disobedience. Against this froward and wilful wicked
world, may be set (as flat contrary) as well the examples of holy Angels,
and other Gods good creatures in heaven: as also of Saints and holy people,
which esteemed nothing more pleasant, nothing more precious, and nothing better
in their life, than to be obedient unto God by faith.

The sixth cause of sins ouerrunning the world, is ( The Prince that rules in
the air,) Psa. 109. 7
that is to say the Devil. For he, Math. 27. 4. 5.
as the holy history bears witness of traitorous Judas, Mark. 14. 21. 43.
44. 45.
enters into men's hearts, and pulls them forward into diverse sins and
offenses, that they should not be saved. Against him (as flat contrary) may
be set the Prince that rules in the Church, Luke. 22. 22. 47. 48.
Christ Jesus, who gives his holy spirit to them that ask it. And he is the
first and chiefest author: Ioh. 17. 12. and Chap. 18. 3. 4. 5. etc.
yea, the cause of causes of all godly purposes and exercises whatsoever, in
them that are turned, and become new creatures.

Hitherto we have showed, Act. 1. 16 17. 18. etc.
what be the causes of trespasses and sins ouerspreading the world, against
all which, the only and sovereign remedy is Faith in Jesus Christ. 1. Ioh.
5. 4.
This is the victory which overcomes the world, even your faith. In this are
contained the causes of doing good deeds, which causes I have already
rehearsed: in this is Christ the conqueror of the kingdom of darkness
possessed: in this we are made new men, and regenerated: by this a new spirit,
wherewith we withstand the flesh, is obtained: finally, by this the whole
body of sin is stricken dead and mortified.

Verses. 4. 5. 6. and. 7.
4 But God, which is rich in mercy, through his great love, vvherevvith he
loved us,

5 Even when we were dead by sins, has quickened us together in Christ;
by whose grace ye are saved,

6 And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly
places, in Christ Jesus,

7 That he might show in the ages to come, the exceeding riches of his grace,
through his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

But God, which is rich in mercy, for the great love sake wherewith he loved
us, even when we were dead by sin, has quickened us together with Christ.
(For by grace are ye saved) and has made us sit together in heavenly things
in Christ Jesus, that he might show in times to come, the abundant riches of
his grace, in kindness to us ward in Christ Jesus. THis is an amplification or
enlargement, and an Antithesis or opposition, whereby the common state of the
Jews and Gentiles under grace is declared. Before, the Apostle spoke
severally of them both: now he comprehends and puts them both together,
that he might show the equal condition and state of them both. The sum of
the sentence is this. As God made the Jews partakers of heavenly glory, even
thorough his mere grace and goodness: so did he also the Gentiles. But the
Apostle, to the end he might enlarge his speech, amplifieth the same according
to his manner, by the place of causes and effects: rehearsing the self same
things here, which he spoke in the first Chapter touching this mystery. For in
the first place he sets down the principal ground, or chief cause of our
restitution and recovery: to wit, the mere mercy of God, wherewith he loved
us in Christ. After that, he makes mention of the fruits of this mercy,
which is of three sorts: namely, of life, of resurrection, and of heavenly
grace in Christ. For the life of Christ, his resurrection, and his sitting in
heavenly places, is a certain assurance, a pledge, and merit of our life, our
resurrection, and heavenly grace. For seeing we are the members of Christ, we
shall be partakers of the same happiness and glory with our head. And as the
Apostle makes Christ the mean, by whom these so great benefits are conveyed
unto us: so he makes the declaring of Gods grace toward men, the end of these
benefits, given and bestowed upon us. Neither is this a declaring of Gods
temporal goodness, but an unspeakable token and sign of his perpetual
goodness. For, that which Christ once did, that remains for ever, as an
assured warrant of Gods goodness toward us. Now, touching that which is
enclosed in a Parenthesis, ( By grace ye are saved,) it is indeed a very short
saying, howbeit the same contains the whole sum and cause of all Gods good
graces, powered upon us through Christ: the benefit it self, is ( Salvation:)
the cause is ( Grace:) that is, the honor of God, which is grounded in Christ,
and from him conveyed unto us, as from the head to the members. Here again is
commended unto us a general doctrine of the Church of God: to wit, that unto
God alone, for Christ his sons sake, our redemption is to be ascribed. By
which doctrine their vanity is disproued, who refer the benefit of our
salvation to men's works and merits, either going before, or following after,
or joined with justification. But this doctrine is treated upon more at large,
in the point or discourse following: and it is amplified by it own proper
causes, improper causes put apart.

Verses. 8. 9. and. 10
8 For by grace are ye saved, through faith, (and that not of your selves: it
is the gift of God.)

9 Not of works, least any man should boast himself.

10 For we are his vvorkemanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
that we should walk in them.

By grace are ye saved through faith (and this is not of your selves, it is the
gift of God,) not of works, least any man should boast. For we are his
workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God ordein'd (or
prepared) before, that we should walk in them. Here the Apostle gathers as
it were into one Aphorism, the whole matter which hitherto he has handeled:
to the end it may the better be seen, and that the circumstances and causes
also being placed together, might the easier be borne in remembrance, and
understood. First therefore he sets down ( Grace) whereby God takes us
again unto him, of his mere mercy, for Christ's sake, who is the matter of
our salvation. The effect of this grace, he makes to be ( Salvation:) that is,
our justification, and our glorification. He adds the instrument whereby the
same is received, even ( Faith.) For by faith we receive the promise of
salvation which the Gospel does present and offer unto us.

But because false Apostles, sworn enemies to grace, have for the most part
attributed the benefit of salvation to the works of men: the Apostle disproueth
them, taking his reason from the contrary cause. Salvation says he, is the
gift of God, Ergo, it is not of works: For these two can agree in no case: To
have somewhat of free gift: and, To obtain the same by desert of works. This
is avouched by S. Paul, Romans 11. 6
saying: Si ex gratia, etc. If it be of grace, it is no more of works, or else
were grace no more grace: but if it be of works, it is no more grace, or else
were work no more work. How often soever therefore our salvation is said to
be either the gift of God, or to be of grace, or to be obtained by faith, or to
be ours without works, all manner of merit in man, touching the work of our
salvation, is tript and thrown under foot.

Now, why salvation is not of works, he shows a reason in these words, (
Least any man should boast.) Herto serves that saying also, Romans 3. 27
Vbi est gloriatio, etc. Where is then the reioising? It is excluded. By what
law? Of works? Naie. But by the law of faith. For that which is obtained by
faith, is altogether of free gift, and therefore it excludes all reioising or
boasting: contrariwise, whatsoever we get by our own works and travel, that
is matter to us of boasting.

Furthermore, because the fleshly minded, hearing this benefit of salvation to
be ours by free gift, and without works or merits, that is to say, without
the desert of works, snatch at it, and thereupon take full liberty to sin:
the Apostle meets them in the mouth, and lays against them, the very next
or nearest end of salvation, which he did beat upon in the first Chapter:
namely, our sanctification. ( For we are his workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus unto good works, that we should walk in them.) The word ( For) is
oftentimes so taken in an objection, that it seems to carry a reason or
cause of a thing with it. But yet notwithstanding, it does not render a reason
or cause of the former speech, but rather gives a privy answer to the
adversaries objection. For when Saint Paul says, that we have salvation
without works, one or other may thus object and say: If we obtain salvation
without works, then what need we do good works? The Apostle answers that
it follows not. For we are created in Christ unto ( good works.) And thus
the word ( For) contains a reason to reprove the reply of the adversaries:
whose objection the Apostle answers in this place. The observation of the
use of this word ( For) is profitable, that we may know and understand whereto
the same serves.

Thus far touching the meaning of this Aphorism. Now let us to the
specialities of the same in due order. The first, The free goodness of God is
the only cause of our salvation. The second, By faith alone we are made
partakers of salvation freely given. The third, Man's works are neither the
causes, nor the merits, nor part of our salvation. The fourth, Good works are
joined with faith, as a necessary and inseperable accident. The fifth, All man's
reioising or boasting in the work of salvation is excluded. The sixth,
Regeneration or new birth in Christ, is the cause of good works. These six
specialties are in the words of this short piece of doctrine, which contain
the principal and chief grounds of Christian Religion, and confute many
foul and gross errors. For, first of all, they are confuted here, which
will have salvation to stand upon faith and works together, as upon the parts
thereof. But Saint Paul in this place does manifestly exclude works, and
sets down faith, not as a part, or as a cause of salvation, but as an
instrument only.

Secondly, they are also confuted by this saying of S. Paul, who, whiles they
grant with us, that men are justified by faith alone, exclude works, not
only as causes and merits, but also as necessary consequents: as though good
works were not necessarily required in such as are justified, and have
obtained salvation by free gift. Against whom S. Paul in this place does
plainly reason, requiring ( Works) as a necessary consequent of salvation,
and as a necessary and inseperable accident of regeneration. Works therefore
(as S. Barnard says) are not the cause of reigning, Romans 3. 28
but a way to reign: not the cause of our coming to Gods kingdom, but a
way thereunto.

Furthermore, by this saying of S. Paul are overthrown all preparing works
(as they term them) to justification. For if our works were required, as
preparatiues, then would not S. Paul have spoken thus, Absque operibus,
Without works. Let us therefore bear away, and hold fast this speech of ye
Apostle, whereby we are instructed in our salvation, and armed against the
errors, both of the Papists, and the Pharisees: besides that, we are warned
what our duty is, which have obtained salvation freely through Christ.

Verses. 11. 12. and. 13.
11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, and
called uncircumcision of them, which are called circumcision in the flesh made
with hands,

12. That ye were, I say, at that time without Christ, and were aliants
from the Co^monvvealth of Israel, and were strangers from the covenants of
promise, and had no hope, and were without God in the world:

13 But now in Christ Jesus, ye which once were far off, are now made
near by the blood of Christ.

Wherefore be ye mindful, that ye were Gentiles in the flesh, which were
called uncircumcision of them that are called circumcision in the flesh made
with hands, because at that time ye were without Christ, aliens (or foreners)
from the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers of the testaments of promise,
having no hope, and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, ye which
sometime were far off, are made nigh in the blood of Christ. THis is an other
part of the comparison: to wit, of the state of the Gentiles before grace, and
under grace: which part of the comparison, does not in very deed, but after a
certain manner only differ from the former: which manner stands upon
circumstances. Now the Apostle says, that the Gentiles did differ from the
people of God in two circumstances: first, in the sign: secondly, in grace.
In the sign, because that, as the Gentiles were uncircumcised, in witness of
their uncleanness: so the Jews had the circumcision of promise. In grace,
because that, as the Gentiles were ( Without Christ,) who is the only way of
salvation, ( Out of the Commonwealth of Israel,) that is to say, not of Gods
people, ( Strangers from the covenants of promise,) that is to say, without
the witnesses and testaments, whereby God bound himself to his people, (
Without hope, and without God,) that is to say, men living in the world,
utterly void of Gods fear and service: so the Jews had all these things of
grace. For they had the promise of the Messiah, they were in the Commonweath of
Israel, they were heirs of the covenants of promise, they had the hope of
salvation, and they knew God.

To this he adds an Antithesis or opposition, teaching that the Gentiles are
now reconciled unto God, by the blood of Christ, and received into the
Commonwealth and household of God, through the same Jesus Christ: Ye (says the
Apostle) which once were far off* (namely from grace) are now made near, to
wit, by the means of Christ's blood. All these things serve to this end, that
he might beat down the pride and ^igh mindedness of the Ephesians: and that
he might awake them, to wonder at this so great a treasure: least being
unthankful to God, they should fall again into their old superstition: that
is to say, least forgetting Christ's benefits, they should slide back from the
Gospel, being deceived with the wily slights of Satan and the world. This is
the sum of all. Now, to touch the circumstances of the text particularly,
which needs both expounding, and advise, we will thus proceed. First, he
wills the Ephesians to ( Remember.) And why so? Because, when men are
advanced from a low degree to a higher, they quickly and easily (God wot)
forget their former state. By this advise therefore, or warning, it is the
Apostles mind to humble the Ephesians, and to admonish them of constancy, of
continuance, and of thanksgiving: that they might discharge themselves by
their duetifulnesse, and give God the glory, to whom it does of right belong,
for pouring upon them so many great benefits, and that of his free goodness
and liberality.

Heerehence have we also, which live at this day, to be warned and well
advised, that because God has vouchsafed, of his mere goodness, to call us
out of the darkness of Popery, into the clear light of the Gospel, that we
live worthy of so great grace, and by the heinousness of our sins provoke
not Gods wrath against us, least he justly and deservedly take that from us
again, being unthankful, which before he gave us of his good grace, when we
were, unworthy. That is a very evil unthankfulness, when men vouchsafe not
to give men thanks for their good turns: but far worse, and more abominable
is that, whereby we show our selves unthankful unto God, who would that his
dear son should die for us, that we might live. Besides this, when the Apostle
says thus, ( Gentiles in the flesh, and called uncircumcision of them which
are called circumcision in the flesh, made with hands,) he notes two things:
First, that the Jews called the Gentiles, by the reproachful name of
uncircumcision: which Jews indeed bragged much more than they needed, of that
outward mark in their skin or flesh. Of this bragging and bosting, there is
an example in Genesis: Genesis 34. 14.
Non possumus, etc. We cannot (say the sons of Jacob) do this thing, to
give our sister to an uncircumcised man. 1. Sam. 16. 26, and. 36
Again, David being full of Gods spirit, speaks of Goliath in this manner,
Et quid, etc. Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should revile the
host of the living God? This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of
them, seeing he has railed on the host of the living God. Again, S. Paul in
this place makes two sorts of Jews, and two sorts of Gentiles. For some of
the Jews were circumcised in the flesh, and in the spirit: as Moses, Aaron,
Iosue, Phinees, Abraham, Isaach, Jacob, Joseph, David, Josias, Daniel, Simeon,
Nathanael, etc. to be short, all that received the outward circumcision of the
flesh, with faithfulness of heart in the Messiah promised. Some were circumcised
in the flesh only: to wit, they which had the outward mark without the
spirit, such were many: yea, the most of ye Jews, specially at the time of
ye Lords coming: the first are called ( The children of promise:) the last, (
The children of the flesh:) which names the Apostle gives to them both. In
like manner Paul makes two sorts of Gentiles. Some were Gentiles only in ye
flesh, having uncircumcision, the badge of their Gentilisme: howbeit in spirit
they were circumcised: namely, which had the uncircumcision of the flesh, with
a lively faithfulness in and upon the free promise of salvation. In the
number of these were Job, Melchisedech, Iethro, the three Wisemen, and all, as
many as truly believed in the Messiah. Othersome were Gentiles, both in the
flesh and in the spirit: namely they, who by the outward badge in their flesh,
declared ye uncircumcision and uncleanness of their heart.

Furthermore, where he adds, ( Ye were without Christ, ye were aliants from
the Commonwealth of Israel, and ye were strangers from the covenants of
promise) these words are meant, and must be understood by comparison. For the
Gentiles, in respect of the people of Israel, and ye certain time, are said to
be without Christ. Now, in saying ( They were without Christ,) he means that
they had not such clear knowledge of Christ as the Jews had. ( And aliants
from the Commonwealth of Israel,) that is to say, ( Strangers from the
covenants of promise:) by these words he notes, that the Israelites had their
Commonwealth divided and parted from the Gentiles, as one household is set
asunder from an other. For the Jews had their covenants, their ordinances, and
service of God: their promises, their kingdom, and their Priesthood, etc. of
which S. Paul speaks to the Romans. Of this difference in like manner, Romans
9. 4.
the Psalm makes mention, saying: Psalm. 147. 19. 20.
Qui annunciat, etc. He shows his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his
judgments unto Israel. He has not dealt so with every nation, neither have
they known his judgments.

The words which follow, ( And had no hope, and were without God in the world,)
are concluded upon ye words which went before. For whosoever is without Christ,
how is it possible he should have hope. Whosoever is without Christ, he indeed
is without God: for all that abide not in ye doctrine of Christ, have not God.
Contrariwise, 2. John. 9.
he alone is said to have God, he (I say) yt is in Christ by faith. Herto
serves the saying of S. John, Omnis qui, etc. Whosoever trangresseth, and
abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that continues in the
doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son.

The comparison which follows, ( Ye which once were far off, are made
near by the blood of Christ,) does signify the Ephesians, which were before
out of the Church, but now, through grace, received and brought into the
Church* and reconciled unto God by the blood of Jesus Christ. All these things
tend hereunto, as I have said already, that we remembering so great a benefit
of heavenly grace, should walk in the fear of God: being mindful, that this
our state requires new manners, and a new life: to wit, Tit. 2. 12. 13. 14.
That we should live holilie, and honestly, godly, and vnblameablie in this
world, looking for that blessed hope, and coming of the glory of the great
God, and our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, to redeem us from
iniquity, and to cleanse us a peculiar people unto himself, and followers of
good works.

Verses. 14. 15. and. 16.
14 For he is our peace, which has made of both, one: and has broken the stop
of the partition wall,

15 In abrogating, through his flesh, the hatred, that is, the law of
commandments, which stands in ordinances, for to make of tvvaine, one nevve
man in himself, so making peace,

16 And that he might reconcile both unto God, in one body, by his cross, and
stay hatred thereby.

For he is our peace, which has made both one, breaking down the wall that
was a stop between us, and putting away through his flesh the law of
commandments, contained in the law written, that of twain he might make
one new man in himself, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one
body, by his cross, staieng hatred thereby. IT is said, that the Gentiles,
which were sometimes out of Gods household, are now taken in, and made of the
number, by Christ's blood. Now, there is added a notable figure of Rhetorike,
called Expolitio, whereby that is expounded more at large, which was said before
briefly and in sum. For the manner of reconciliation or atonement between
both people: to wit, Jews and Gentiles, is declared. And to begin withal,
Christ is made the foundation of this reconciliation or atonement, when it is
said thus of the Apostle, ( He is our peace,) that is to say, He is the
Author of the reconciliation or atonement, whereby of two people: namely,
Jews and Gentiles, there is made one: that is, one Church, which is the
peculiar household of God. After this is showed the manner of reconciliation,
first in a similitude: then in plain and evident words.

The similitude is this, ( The stop of the partition wall) that is to say, the
hedge put between them is cut down and laid wast. The similitude must be
expounded in this sort. As he that is minded of two households to make but one,
pulls down the wall which was between them, and made them two sundry
households, whereby they are now made but one: so God, minding to make one
people, one Church, or one household of the Jews and the Gentiles, took away
( The partition wall) which set them asunder. Now what this ( Partition wall)
between ye Jews and the Gentiles was, he shows in these plain words, ( The
hatred, that is, the law of commandments which stands in ordinances.) Here,
by the figure Metonymia, he calls ( Hatred) the cause of the separation
between the Jews and the Gentiles, which cause he makes to be ( The law of
commandments which stands in ordinances.) Now, when he makes this cause to
be the law, he means not the moral law, which is perpetual: but the
ceremonial law only, which was a shadow of things to come. And this is
that which the Apostle says, ( He has taken away hatred, even the law of
commandments, which stands in ordinances,) that is, in rites and
ceremonies: ( Through his flesh,) that is, by offering up his flesh a
sacrifice. A sign or token of this abrogation or taking away of the law, was
the renting of the temple in sunder, Mat. 27. 5.
when the Lord gave up the ghost upon the altar of the cross. He adds also
the end of this abrogation or abolishment, Mark. 15. 38.
saying: ( To make of twain, Luke. 23. 45.
one new man in himself.) By the figure Metonymia, he caleth two nations of
people, as it were diverse households, by the name of ( two men.) He calls the
Church of God one man, which is as it were one household: yea rather, one man,
whose head is Christ: he calls this man, ( the new man:) having an eye to the
fashion and custom of the world, which uses to call them ( new men) that
being but base borne, or coming but of mean stock and parentage, become
noble and honorable. For we being the offspring of Adam, our forlorn father,
are made ( new men,) and adopted into the sons of God, whiles we fasten our
faith upon Christ: so that we are no longer called the children of Adam, but
the children of God. He rehearses this end yet more plainly, saying, ( That
he might reconcile both unto God in one body, by his cross,) that is: by the
oblation which he made upon the cross. For under this word ( Cross) is meant
the manner of making the oblation, whereby a double reconciliation or
atonement was made: the one, of men with God: the other, of men with men:
namely, of the Jews and Gentiles between themselves.

Thus far concerning the meaning of Saint Paul's words, now let us mark the
specialties, which this place does offer and afford.

The first is, that between the Jews and the Gentiles there is no difference,
in respect of the communion and partaking of grace. Wherefore let none be
proud, because he is a Jew: and let none despair, because he is a Gentile. For
one nation has no more prerogative or excellence than another, Acts. 10. 34.
35.
before God. God is no regarder of persons: but in all people, he that fears
him is accepted before him: and he that works righteousness is esteemed.
Grace is common unto all, and it is offered to every one.

The second is, That the law of Moses is abrogated and put down, (I mean for
outward rites and ceremonies:) insomuch, that none stands compellable to
receive it: yea, whosoever receives it, denies Christ, and despises the
virtue of Christ's cross.

The third is, That the death of Christ is the reconciliation and atonement of
man with God: wherein we are borne ( new men) and ingraffed into Christ's body,
as members of the same. The fourth is, That without the cross of Christ, we
can, by no means, be at peace with God.

The fifth is, That as in Christ we have peace with God: so it is meet, that in
him also we labor to be at peace and unity one with another: which
(doubtless) can never be, unless we be lead by Christ's spirit, and have faith
in him. For by faith we are ingraffed into his body, that all of us, as many
as believe in Christ, may be made the members of Christ. Wherefore it is reason
and duty, that one of us should make much of another, as members of one and
the self same body.

Verses. 17. and 18.
17 And came and preached peace unto you, which were a far off, and to them
that were near.

18 For through him, we both have an entrance unto the Father by one spirit.

And coming, he preached peace unto you, which were far off, and to them that
were nigh. Because through him we both have an open way in one spirit unto the
Father. THe matter of reconciliation or atonement between the Jews and the
Gentiles being expounded, the Apostle comes to the isntrumental cause
thereof, which is, The preaching of the Gospel. For it is Gods pleasure, that
his Gospel should not only be an instrument of salvation, but also a
witness and warrant of his good will. Whereupon it comes to pass, that the
Gospel is unto us, a most assured and certain messenger, and tidings bringer
of peace, between God and us. For which cause the Gospel is named, 2. Co. 5.
19
Sermo reconciliationis, The word of reconciliation. The division following,
where Christ is said to have come, and to have preached to them ( which were a
far off, and to them which were near:) that is to say, to the Jews, and to
the Gentiles, notes unto us, that Christ sent his Apostles to preach the
Gospel of peace unto all people, one with an other, none excepted: Mark. 16.
15.
according to that saying: Ite in mundum, etc. Go ye throughout all the world,
and preach the Gospel unto every creature. The fruit of their peace made
with God is also added, which is, that both of them: to wit, the Jews and the
Gentiles, ( Have entrance unto the Father, by Christ, and that in one spirit:)
that is to say, by the self same spirit of Christ, which makes us cry, Romans
8. 15
Abba Father. Christ therefore is as it were a door unto us, Gal. 4. 6.
whereby we come to the Father, being reconciled and set at one with us, in
faith and belief. Now the holy spirit is our guide, by whom we being joined
and united in Christ, coming to the door, are let in, and have entrance to
the father. Hereto serves that saying of John, Amen, Ioh. 10. 1. and. 7.
Amen dico vobis, etc. Verelie Verelie I say unto you, he that enters not in
by the door into the sheepfold, but climeth up another way, he is a thief,
and a robber. And a little after, Ego sum ianua ouium, I am the door of the
sheep. Furthermore, here are two places to be marked: the one is, what account
we ought to make of the ministers of the Gospel, who when they preach to us
the gospel, Christ himself is said to preach unto us. Wherefore we ought no
less to regard their voice, than if we heard Christ himself speaking unto us.
Herto serves that saying of Saint Paul, 2. Co. 19. 20.
Nomine, etc. Now then are we ambassadors for Christ, as though he did beseech
you through us, we pray you in Christ's stead, that ye be reconciled to God.
The other place is, of the fruit of ye gospel: namely, that such as believe
ye gospel, are reconciled unto God through Christ, by whom they have entrance
unto God. The Apostle says, Iustificati, etc. Being justified by faith, Romans
5. 1. 2
we have peace toward God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have
entrance, etc. Contrariwise, who so has not Christ, that is, believes not in
Christ, he is void of the fruit of the Gospel: and therefore is to be thought
and taken for a wicked person, and an enemy to God.

Verse. 19. and. 20.
19 Now therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but Citizens
with the Saints, and of the household of God,

20 And are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus
Christ himself being the chief corner stone.

Now therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens
of the Saints, and of Gods household, being builded upon the foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets, the chief corner stone whereof is Jesus Christ
himself. THis is a general conclusion of the whole Chapter, wherein he
reckons up the principal points. For, first he shows what manner of people
the Ephesians were, before the grace of regeneration or new birth, and by them
all other Gentiles, likewise. Secondly, he declares what they have gotten by
grace. Indeed they were aliants and strangers before, that is, out of Gods
household, as we have showed alredie. But now being made free of the City,
common to all the Saints, they are received into Gods household: because ( They
are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,) that is to say,
because they are received into favor and grace by faith, which is their
leaning staff, to rest themselves by, upon Christ their only foundation. For
no man can lay any other foundation, 1. Co. 3. 11
besides that which is already laid, which is Jesus Christ.

Now, Jesus Christ is called ( The foundation,) both because the promise of
salvation was made in him, and also, because Christ alone is the salvation of
the Church, upon whom she staieth her self. For, without Christ, the whole
building of the Church shrinketh and falls flat to the ground: yea, without
him, it cannot be so much as once begun. He is also called ( The foundation of
the Apostles and Prophets,) not only because the Apostles being built upon
that foundation obtained salvation: but also, and that much more in respect of
the Church. For, the Apostles did build the Church upon this foundation.

Moreover, when the Apostle adds, ( Jesus Christ himself being the chief
corner stone,) he teaches us, by what power and virtue, the building of the
Church, consisting of two diverse people, Jews and Gentiles, continues:
namely, because ( Jesus Christ himself is the chief corner stone.) For, as
the corner stone ioineth walls together, and bears up the whole burden of
the building: yea, preserves it: even so our Lord Jesus Christ, by the
doctrine of faith, and by the efficacy and forceable working of his spirit,
knitteth the Jews and the Gentiles, in unity of faith and peace: and so he
himself vpholdeth and mainteineth this spiritual building.

This similitude is borrowed of the Prophet Esaie, whose words lie thus in
order, Ecce, ego ponam in Syon lapidem, Esaie. 28. 16.
etc. Behold; I will late in Syon a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner
stone, a s^^e foundation: He that believes, shall not make have: namely, to
his own counselles, but shall attend and wait for the counsel and purpose of
God, which if he do, he shall not be put to shame. The self same saying of
the Prophet, Saint Peter reherseth, the sense reserved, but the words a little
changed. For thus says he: Ecce, ponam, etc. Behold, I will put in Syon a
chief corner stone, 1. Pet. 2. 6.
elect and precious, and he that believes therein, shall not be ashamed. Of
this stone, mention is also made in the Psalm: Lapidem quem, Psalm. 11. 8 22.
etc. The stone which the builders refused, is the head of the corner.

Beside that which is said, we have to gather out of Saint Paul's words, these
specialties following.

The first is, That of Jews and Gentiles there is one Church of Christ made
and joined together, as we have showed already.

The second is, That Christ alone is the foundation of the Church.

The third is, That whosoever is without Christ, he also is without the Church.

The fourth is, That the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets alone, ought to
have authority in the Church of God, and is the only badge and cognizance of
the true Church.

The fifth is, That Christ alone vpholdeth, keeps, and mainteineth the Church.

The sixth is, That the Church is not without ministry, which preaches unto
us the same corner stone which Saint Paul commends unto us here.

These specialties overthrow many errors of the Papists: and chiefelie of
them, which will have us trust and betake our selves to men's merits and
safegards: and which also, in the place of the Prophets and Apostles doctrine,
plant men's traditions and forgeries. Let Popery therefore be unto all the
godly, a thing most accursed: which it behooves all true Christians to avoid
and fly from, least they themselves be ill fauouredlie defiled therewith, and
being defiled, be also cast off again, and forsaken of God.

Verses. 21. and. 22.
21 In whom all the building coupled together, grows unto an holy Temple
in the Lord,

22 In whom ye also are built together, to be the habitation of God, by the
spirit.

In whom the whole building (or frame) coupled together accordingly, grows
unto an holy Temple in the Lord, in whom also ye are built together to be Gods
dwelling in the spirit. THe Apostle enlarges his conclusion, by a translation,
or turning of the specialties into a generality, and by an exhortation. He
said that the Ephesians were built upon the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets: now he applies this to all the faithful in general. For, he says,
that ( The whole building,) that is, the whole Catholic Church, and all the
members thereof, being builded upon this one corner stone, ( Grows into an
holy temple:) that is to say, that the whole building is made one holy
temple, and that in the Lord, as the only foundation of the temple. Now, S.
Paul in this place uses a very full, significant, and pithie word: namely,
(...): that is ( coupled together) whereby is meant, that ye building of the
Church is so knit and couched together, so framed, I say, and wrought, that
all and every part thereof is fitted and fastened, in such meet proportion,
even measure, and apt agreement, with such sound and strong ioints, that they
hang one by an other very orderly, as the members and lims of the body. Now,
this knitting or conpling of the ioints is done in this manner. First, all the
faithful cleave unto Christ their head by faith, and upon him, as their only
foundation, state themselves. Then they cleave together among themselves, one
with another, according to the measure of faith in every one of them, and
according to the diversity of gifts, which God has given them: that they
might all make one body, and one holy temple of God, of which temple, all the
faithful are lively stones, in such exceeding comely order and agreement
knit together, and wrought in one, that there is not a corporation or company
of men to be found in all the world, linked in like love, concord, and unity
among themselves. Furthermore, when we hear either the whole Church, or the
several members thereof, called ( The holy temple of God,) let us thus
suppose with our selves: First, That the Church is Gods building. Secondly,
That God dwells, in this temple, which is appointed and ordained for his
glory. Thirdly, That as it is a foul and heinous offense* to defile this
temple with any uncleanness, so it becomes all the gooue, to bend their
endeavors every way, that they may lead their life in holiness and
vnblameablenesse, least through their default it come to pass, that the
Master builder cast them out, and throw them away, as rotten and mooldering
stones serving to no good use. I would to God this could sink into their
hearts, which either with their own private lewd dealings blemish the Church:
or with their unprofitable quarelings, cut in pieces the union or agreement of
the Church.

Here the reason must be marked, why the whole Church of God is called ( One
temple:) and why every several believer, is named ( The lively temple of
God) in like case. The whole Church is therefore called the temple of God, both
because it is reared up and built upon one foundation: and also because all the
faithful being joined together in the unity of faith and love, have God
dwelling in them, whom they serve and worship. Every several Christian is
therefore called the lively temple of God, both for that every of them is
builded upon one only foundation, which is the Lord Jesus Christ: and also,
for that God dwells in every of them, whose mightiness is to be praised and
magnified of all generally, and also of every one particularly.

The exhortation of the Apostle does follow. ( In whom (says he) ye also are
built together to be the habitation of God, by the spirit.) (In whom.) to wit,
the corner stone, ( ye also are built together:) namely, by the faith of
Christ, and love among your selves one with another, renouncing and forsaking
all unholiness, heathenishnesse, and uncleanness. After this manner the
Apostle speaks elsewhere, in an exhortation, drawing his argument or proof
from the dignity or worthiness of Gods temple. 1. Co. 6. 9
For these are his words, Ah: Non scitis, etc. Ah: Know ye not, that your body
is the temple of the holy Ghost, which is in you, whom ye have of God?

THE THIRD CHAPTER.
THE SVMME OF THE third Chapter.
I Paul a Prisoner of Jesus Christ, bear embassage for your behoof, O ye
Gentiles, to open and make known unto you the mystery of salvation. Wherefore
I request you to continue constant and steadfast in the doctrine which ye have
received: whereto, that the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, would vouchsafe to
give you strength, I bow my knees, to whom be glory for evermore.

THE ORDER AND PARTS OF the third Chapter.
OF this Chapter there are four parts. The first is, a comfirmation of the
calling of the Gentiles, whereof he reasoned in the last Chapter: which
confirmation is taken from Saint Paul's Apostleship, or from the end whereto it
was ordained: the sum of it is this. God has made and appointed me Paul an
Apostle of the Gentiles: therefore belongs the Gospel to the Gentiles in
deed. This part has his amplifications or enlargements, whereby both the
Gospel is advanced, and Saint Paul's Apostleship also commended.

The second part stands upon an exhortation to constancy and perseueraunce,
which is the end of his whole writing: as I gave you to note even now, in the
declaration of the Argument or sum of the Epistle.

The third part is a signification of Saint Paul's prayer for the Ephesians,
that it would please God to give them strength and perfect knowledge of Christ.

The fourth is a thanksgiving. The first of these parts is didascalicall,
that is, serving for doctrine, from the which the rest have their issue,
wherein the doctrine is applied to the Ephesians.

THE EXPOSITION OF THE THIRD Chapter, with the observation of doctrines therein
contained.
Verse. 1.
1 For this cause, I Paul am the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles.
For this things sake, I Paul am that same prisoner (or captive) of Jesus
Christ for you Gentiles. THis is the first part of the Chapter: to wit, a
confirmation of the calling of the Gentiles. The meaning of the words is this.
Mine Apostleshippe which I bear among the Gentiles, and for the which I am now
kept prisoner, is a proof sufficient, that the Gospel pertains to the
Gentiles. ( The prisoner or captive of Christ,) is passiuelie taken, and
betokens to suffer. For Saint Paul was taken and kept prisoner for the
glory of Christ, showed unto the Gentiles. I have added the particle ( Sum,
Am,) as Erasmus does, to make the sentence fall perfect and full, that (
Prisoner) might be the Predicatum, which therefore has very well his Article
joined with him, because it is taken figuratiuelie, (...) for excellency sake,
as in that of S. John, (...), I am not that same light. And again, (...), I am
that good shepherd. So here also, (...), I am that same prisoner of Jesus
Christ, who have the name every where to be him, that would make the Gentiles
equal with the Jews: for which things sake, I am now lead away to Rome, and
there kept prisoner. Here three places offer themselves unto us. The first,
That the preaching of the Gospel is ordained for the building up of the
Church. The second, That the godly preachers of the word, must look for
nothing but trouble and persecution at the hands of the world. The third, That
the preaching of the Gospel is a most assured token and undoubted warrant of
Gods favor.

Verses. 2. 3. and. 4.
2 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given
me to you ward,

3 That is, that God by revelation has shevved this mystery unto me, as I
vvrote above in fevv words:

4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may know mine understanding in the mystery of
Christ.

If ye have heard of the dispensation, (or ministration) of the grace of God,
which is given me to you ward, to wit, that God by revelation has made the
Gospel known unto me, (as I wrote unto you before, whereby, when ye read ye
may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ. THis is a cause of the
former reason, taken from the cause efficient, which (he says) was not
unknown to the Ephesians. First he shows, he was called of God to the office
of an Apostle. Secondly, he declares ye manner of his calling. Thirdly, he
avouches that he learned the Gospel from above, even of God, concerning which
thing he wrote to the Ephesians before, as he says, to the intent that they in
reading, might understand and know the certeintie of his doctrine and calling.
Acts. 9. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. etc.
All these points pertain to this purpose, that we may be assured, that S.
Paul was an Apostle of the Gentiles, by the appointment and commandment of
God, Acts. 22. 4 5. 6. 7. etc.
so that we need not at any hand to doubt of the certeintie of his vocation
or calling: Acts. 26. 12 13. 14. 15. etc.
testimonies whereof may be read in the Acts of the Apostles, in his Epistles
to the Galathians, and the Philippians. Gal. 1. 13. 14. 15. etc.


Here three things meet us worthy of marking. Phil. 3. 4. 5 etc.
First, How necessary the certeintie of their calling is, which teach in the
Church. The second, That the Gospel is a mystery unknown to man's reason:
flat against that most filthy and beastly knave, which braggeth without
shame, that he (forsooth) by natural reason found out the necessity of the
Gospel, and the sending of the Messiah into the world, without the writings of
the Prophets and Apostles. The third, That the certeintie of the Apostles
doctrine is immovable, steadfast, and undeceivable.

Verses. 5. and 6.
5 Which in other ages was not opened unto the sons of men, as it is now
revealed unto his Apostles and Prophets, by the spirit,

6 That the Gentiles should be inheritours also, and of the same body, and
partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospel.

Which in other ages (or times) was not known to the sons of men, as it is
now opened unto the holy Apostles and Prophets, by the spirit, that the
Gentiles are coheires and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in
Christ, by the Gospel. THis is an amplification or enlargment by comparison,
wherein a reason is rendered, why the Gospel of the calling of the Gentiles is
named ( A Mystery:) to wit, because it was unknown to the world, till such
time as it was opened by heavenly revelation: that it was not made manifest to
all the Gentiles indifferently, one with an other: that the knowledge of this
mystery was not so evident to the old Prophets, as it was to the Apostles.
For, although the old Prophets prophesied much of the calling of the Gentiles
to the Gospel: yet notwithstanding, the time and the manner thereof were not
so clear to them, as to the Apostles, Now, what kind of mystery this is of
the Gospel, which he has in hand, he declares, in saying, ( That the
Gentiles should be inheritours also, and of the same body, and partakers of
his promise, in Christ, by the Gospel.) The mystery of the Gospel therefore
is this, That the Jews and the Gentiles are made ioint-heires of the heavenly
inheritance, that they all make one body in Christ, and that the promise of
grace, which is offered by the Gospel, pertains unto them both alike. This
equality, or making of the Jews and Gentiles all alike, overthrows the
prerogative or title of excellency, whereof the Jews may seem to vaunt.
For, salvation is a mere free gift, which is also offered freely to the most
unworthy Gentiles, and to Idolaters, but is received by faith alone. For when
the Apostle says, ( Of his promise in Christ,) and when he makes the Jews
and the Gentiles even and equal: what else does he, but exclude and harre out
all degrees of worthiness in merits, and requires the faith of the promise?
The specialties of this place follow in order.

The^ first, That the Gospel is a mystery, which man's reason cannot of it
self, by any means, reach unto.

The second, That the mystery of the Gospel is reveled by the holy Ghost, in
preaching with lively voice, and sounding utterance. For outward preaching
avails and profits little, unless there be present within us, the true
teacher: namely, the holy Ghost, which is effectual and forceable in the
word, and with the word.

The third, That all Christ's faithful ones, are heirs of one and the self
same inheritance, members of one and the self same body, and partakers of
one and the self same salvation, by one and the self same Jesus Christ.

The fourth, That the dignity of the ministry of the Gospel is exceeding
great, and the necessity thereof is not small. For, by the same, the promise of
salvation, which is to be received by faith alone, is offered unto all in
Christ Jesus.

Verse. 7.
7 Whereof I am made a minister, by the gift of the grace of God, given unto
me, through the vvorking of his power. Whereof I am made a minister,
according to the gift of Gods grace, given unto me, according to the working of
his power. SAint Paul meets them in the teeth, which would charge him with
arrogancy, for that he does so highly advance his ministry, and he uses a
certain shifting off from himself to an other. For, he does not make his own
merit or virtue, but Gods grace, the cause that he was called to be an
Apostle. Again, he ascribes it to the working of Gods power, that by his
Apostleship, it pleased God to build his Church. For seeing God is able to
bring to pass, that things which are not, may be: why then might he not of a
bloudsucker make a^^ Apostle? why then might he not of an arrogant person, make
a wise preacher? why then might he not of a weakling, make a Champion? Let
every one of us set before his eyes this example of S. Paul, and if we covet
and desire to seem any thing in ye house of God, let us confess, that it is
the gift of God: if any of us have some place of dignity and account in the
Church, let him acknowledge that it was the working of Gods power: if any thing
that is singular and excellent proceed from him, let him cast away all vain
arrogancy and bragging, let him abase himself before God, let him know that
greater gifts are given him, that he might be more bound to serve others, and
not to take upon him the office of a Controller, to reprove and find fault
with others: but let him honor and reverence every one, according as his
place and degree shall require.

Athanasius notes upon this place, Three things necessary in the Ministers of
Gods word.
that in the ministers of Gods word, three things are necessary. The first, a
stout and valiant heart that will not shrink in any danger: as here S.
Paul writes and preaches Christ boldly, and with a courage, even in bonds
and imprisonment. The second, wisdom and understanding, without which he is
not able to discharge this hard and buisie office. The third, an upright life,
holy, and honest. For it is the duty of a shepherd to go before his flock,
no less in life than in voice: and as well in deed, as in word. When these
three things shine in the ministers of God, their labor cannot be without
plentiful fruit. Contrariwise, when the hearts of the ministers are stricken
dead with the fear of Tyrants, when they are discouraged, when the foundations
of their doctrine are not faithfully laid, when their life is not answerable
to the worthiness of their calling, then the church of God is in a miserable
taking. For what shall become of the sheep, when either the shepherd is
devoured of the woolfe, or else unarmed flees from the woolfe, leaving his
sheep at hap hazard?

Verses. 8. 9. 10. and. 11.
8 Even unto me the least of all Saints is this grace given, that I should
preach among the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ,

9 And to make clear unto all men, what the fellowship of the mystery is,
which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who has created
all things by Jesus Christ,

10 To the intent that now, unto principalities and powers in heavenly
places, might be known, by the Church, the manifold wisdom of God,

11 According to the eternal purpose, which he wrought in Christ Jesus our
Lord.

Unto me the least of all Saints this grace is given, even to preach among the
Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make evident unto all men,
what the followshippe (or communion) of this mystery is, which has been
hidden from beginnings in God, who made all things through Christ, that now
might be known unto rules and powers in heavenly places, by the Church (or
congregation,) the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose,
which he purposed (or decreed) in our Lord Jesus Christ. THat which the
Apostle had briefly touched, he discourses upon more at large: namely, that
he was called of God to be an Apostle of the Gentiles. And this is the sum of
this long period or point. But, that we may gather greater fruit thereout, I
will severally entreat upon every part of this amplification or enlargement,
and make the same serve to our use

First therefore when he says, ( Unto me the least of all Saints, is this
grace given,) he does not abase his office, but acknowledges the condition of
his own person: and that for this purpose, that the greatness of: Gods grace
toward him might the more excel. What learn we by this? Even to magnify and
advance our office, whereunto we are called, with thanksgiving, and to take
nothing unto our selves arrogantlie. If therefore we do any thing aright, let
us ascribe the same wholly unto Gods grace, not to our selves, who without the
grace of God are utterly unprofitable instruments. Let the godly shepherd
therefore not suffer his office to be despised, although he acknowledge
himself unable and unfit for so great a calling. Again, let him not set
light by other his fellow laborers, as his underlings, and himself their
better: but let him confess that they all (as well as he) are stewardes of
the mysteries of God.

Secondly, when the Apostle adds, ( That I should preach among the Gentiles
the unsearchable riches of Christ,) he shows the end of his Apostleshippe.
For he says, he was made an Apostle. Why? Not that under this title he
should boast in idlnesse: but ( That he should preach the unsearchable riches
of Christ,) which (as Saint Ambrose says) he vouchsafed to bestow upon the
Gentiles, a people past hope, that without works they might be saved, even
through faith.

Now, he calls them ( Unsearchable riches of Christ,) not only because the
searching of them out is beyond the reach of reason: but also because they
cannot be found out at the full in this world: no, not of the faithful: but a
taste only given unto them, which is enough for the hope of salvation. By this
speech therefore of the Apostle, not only their arrogancy is rebuked, which
think that they have in their heads, whatsoever is contained in Gods holy
word: but there is also commended unto us a singular and special diligence,
that we should travel (tooth and nail) all that we may, to profit
continually in the school of Christ: ralling upon the holy spirit our
teacher, without whose assistaunce and aid, our labor is utterly lost, in
seeking to obtain this spiritual wisdom. Again, they are also put to
silence, and dashed, which vainlie cogge and lie, that they are Saint Paul's
successors: albeit they preach not with Saint Paul, (The unsearchable riches
of Christ,) touching remission of sins freely given: but either live like
idle and lazy lubbers: or else bring a doctrine, which is at defiance and
daggers drawing with the Gospel of Christ.

Thirdly, when this is added, ( And to make clear unto all men, what the
fellowship of the mystery is,) the Apostle expounds the clause going before.
For that which he called even now ( That unsearchable riches of Christ,) he
expounds now a certain fellowship and partaking of the benefits of Christ,
which the Gospel offers: to wit, That the Jews and the Gentiles are
partakers of the self same redemption in Christ. Herehence let us therefore
learn, that all difference of people, person, estate, and degree, is taken
away: for the kingdom of Christ meddeleth with no such matter: To. 10. 12
For one and the same Christ is rich enough unto all that call upon him.

Fourthlie, when it is thus said, ( Which from the beginning of the world has
been hid in God, who has created all things by Jesus Christ,) he cutteth off
their objection, which despised the Gospel, as a doctrine but lately hatched:
as many also in the Apostles time did. Hereby let us take heart at grass
against the enemies of the Gospel, which fowlie beelie us; calling us brochers
and builders of a certain new and strange doctrine. For, our cause is common
with the holy Apostles of God. Neither are these words added in waste, ( Who
has created all things by Jesus Christ.) For this saying is a testimony and
witness of our new creation. For it is meet and convenient, that by him we
should be newly created, by whom we were first created. As therefore God, in
old time, created the world by Jesus Christ: so is his good pleasure, by the
same Jesus Christ, to restore the world again, and to create it anew. Out of
this place is likewise gathered, not only the eternity and euerlastingnesse
of the son: (For if God by his son created all things, then surely the
son himself was not created, because he was before every creature, and
therefore God:) but also a unity of two natures: to wit, of the Godhead, and
the Manhood: being such a unity, that the properties of both, by reason of the
unity of the person, are communicated: and yet the properties unconfounded.
Therefore Saint Paul says here very well, ( That God made and created all
things by Jesus Christ:) because this Jesus Christ is very God.

And although it be rightly said, Jesus the son of Marie created all things:
yet notwithstanding, it is amiss to say, That the nature of Christ's manhood
created all things. For the nature of Christ's manhood is indeed a creature,
and not a creator. For the interchanging of properties, whereby that which is
proper to one, is ascribed and given to the other, for the communion of them in
the same person, is at no hand to be allowed or granted in names of nature, or
(as the use is to speak) in the Abstract: because, neither those things which
are proper to the Manhood, are to be ascribed to the Godhead: as, To be
created, To suffer, To be temporal, To be limited, etc: neither are those
things which belong only to the Godhead, in any case to be attributed to the
Manhood: as, To be uncreated, Not to suffer, To be eternal, To be unlimited,
etc: but in the Concrete either natural, or personal, either expressing one
nature, or declaring both, this interchaungeable applieng of properties may
well be, because of the identitie or selfesamenesse of the Hypostasis or
person, and a certain necessary sequeale or following: as, that those things
which are proper unto man, should be ascribed unto God, 2. Cor. 28.
and to the son of God, as when it is said, The Lord of glory was crucified:
Mat. 26. 2
to wit, The son of man was crucified: now, The Lord of glory: and, The
son of man, is all one: therefore the Lord of glory was also crucified:
which is made manifest streightwaie by a Syllogism expositorie, or by a reason
consisting in exposition. So God, in the latter days became a little child:
of whom the Prophet speaks in this manner, Esaie. 9. 6.
Puer natus est nobis, etc. For unto us a child is borne, and unto us a son
is given: and the government is upon his shoulder, and he shall call his name,
Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of
peace, etc.

Fiftlie, when he says, ( To the intent that now unto principalities, and
powers in heavenly places,) that is, to Gods holy Angels, ( might be known
by the Church, the manifold wisdom of God,) far above all wisdom of
creatures, he extolleth the perfect knowledge of Gods mysteries, touching the
salvation of the Gentiles by faith, that he might the more deteine and keep
the Ephesians in admiration and wondering at this mystery. For, why should it
not be wonderful, that contrary things are made of contrary things? For, by
death, life was recovered: by weakness, power was obtained: by shame, glory
was gotten: to be short, by death and the curse, life and salvation was given
to them that were dead and damned. And hereof it comes, that the Angels of
Heaven are said, (...), even to stoop down, 1. Pet. 1. 12.
as it were, and attentively to behold and listen, what the Apostles do
preach. Howbeit, this is not so to be taken, as though the Angels profited by
the preaching of the Church: but because in the Church assembled and gathered
out of Jews and Gentiles, they behold, as in a glass, this wisdom of God,
and are asconnished (as it were) at this strange spectacle, that the Lord
Christ vouchsafed the wicked and wretched world so great glory, that all
believers should be blessed, and live with him everlastingly.

Sixtlie, when it is added ( According to the eternal purpose, which he
wrought in Christ Jesus our Lord,) he calls us back, both to the first cause
of our salvation: to wit, the eternal purpose of God, whereby he decreed with
himself from everlasting, to save mankind: and also to the matter of this
salvation: namely, Jesus Christ. But of these causes we have spoken largely
enough in the first Chapter.

Verse. 12.
12 By whom we have boldness and entrance, with confidence, by faith in
him. By whom we are bold to draw nigh, in that trust which we have by faith in
him. THe Apostle sets down the sum of the benefits of the mystery
revealed: that is to say, of the Gospel: and he adds the manner or mean
whereby men receive those benefits. Now, the sum of the benefits is, that we
have peace with God, by our Lord Jesus Christ. For whosoever is not afraid
boldly to come before God, they are persuaded out of doubt, that God is at one
with them, and favorable unto them: yea, they dare call upon him in all their
necessities: to be short, they look for all good and healthful things at his
hands. The mean whereby we receive these benefits, is expressed, when he
says, ( By faith in him,) that is to say, by believing in him.

This place is to be marked against the Papists, That Christ was born was
crucified, was buried, etc.
which say, That faith is only a knowledge and an assenting to the story.
For Saint Paul expresselie in this place ioineth confidence with faith, which
is the note or mark of a justifying faith. Again, here are set down for us
to view, three degrees of faith. The first is, to believe and agree to the
promises of the Gospel. The second is, confidence of mercy craved in Christ.
The third is, boldness to go unto God, and to call upon him. To conclude,
this place teaches us, that calling upon God cannot be without confidence in
Christ. For, as by confidence we have entrance unto God: so without confidence,
there is no coming to God.

Verse. 13.
13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations, for your sakes
which is your glory. Wherefore I desire, that you faint not, because of mine
afflictions, for your sakes, which is your praise. THe second part of the
Chapter now follows, which stands upon exhortation. For the Apostle
exhorts the Ephesians that they fall not from the Gospel, because he being
their Teacher is persecuted and troubled. Now, this proposition is brought in
upon the former matter, in this sort: Because the mystery is so excellent,
which God has opened unto you, concerning the obteining of salvation freely
given, by me, whom God has called to be your Apostle, I would not wish you to
play the slowbackes, or to grow out of heart, for the afflictions and crosses
sake which I suffer, and am pressed down withal.

To this proposition he adds two reasons: the first, from the cause
efficient: the second, from the end of persecution, and the fruit of
constancy. ( For your sakes,) says the Apostle, that is to say: For this
cause have the spiteful Jews delivered me up prisoner into the hands of the
Romans, because I have preached the Gospel unto you, therefore I lie bound in
prison, not for any deed that I have committed like an offender: but for
faithfully discharging my duty and office, whereto God has appointed me.

Afterward, in saying: ( Which is your glory,) he notes, that the end of
his persecution is not the shame of the Ephesians, but rather their glory,
sithence they may see themselves embracers of such a doctrine: as for the
truth and excellency whereof, their teacher is not afeard to suffer, even
extreme troubles. Wherefore, it is meet, that they also be constant to
maintain this doctrine, and valiant likewise against the sharp storms of
afflictions. Hitherto we have declared the Apostles meaning: now let us gather
a few specialties to serve our own use.

The first, The godly, knowing the worthiness and excellency of the Gospel,
shall take heed, that they suffer not themselves to be pulled from the same,
either with smooth flatterings, and alluring means: or with bitter threats,
and sharp persecutions.

The second, The godly shall take heed, that they be not deceived with the
judgment and custom of the world. For, the world is wont to set light by
those things, which men of authority make no account of. Again, which way
soever Fortune turns her self, that way will the favor and estimation of
men be sure to bend. For present prosperity, Oh: that is welcome to all. This
error of the world being very great, as it is dangerous, so it must be
avoided of the godly. For godliness must not be judged by the outward
appearaunce, but the nature and quality of the thing is rather to be looked
into, and a deliverance patiently to be waited upon, according to the
undeceivable promise of God.

The third, Let the ministers of the Gospel learn (by the example of Saint
Paul) a godly and holy carfulness for their flock, that it may be kept
and continued in sincerity of doctrine. For, it is not enough to have taught
aright, unless thou also take heed, with all thine endeavor, that the
pureness of doctrine be not, by any kind of occasion, poisoned or infected.

The fourth, The constancy of the ministers of the word, in bearing the
cross, makes the Gospel more honorable: and it is confirmed with the blood
of the Saints, as it were with a certain seal or signet.

The fifth, A consolation against the offense of the cross: wherein this is to
be learned, and borne away, that the cross of the godly is not shameful
before God, but rather glorious: and then chiefelie, when any one suffers
for the confession of true doctrine. As Saint Peter also teaches, who says,
that to suffer for Christ's sake, is the great glory of Christians. For the
counsel and purpose of God in this point is to be considered, 1. Pet. 13. 14.
15. etc,
whose pleasure it is, to make them like to his son in this world, whom he
determined with himself long since to glorify with him.

The sixth, Heerehence let the ministers of the Gospel peculiarly learn, not
only when they are well, and all things safe, stoutly to do their duty,
and to follow their office manfully: but also to show themselves valiant
hearted, and noble Champions: yea even then, when the burden of the Cross
does bow them, even till they bend under it. A small matter for us (says he)
which are in health, to give good counsel to the sick: A small matter
constantly to teach the Gospel, when all things are in safety, when there is
no show of danger toward. But this is the property of a right noble heart, in
the midst of afflictions, in the midst of the flaming fire, (as Saint Paul
and other Saints have done,) courageously to comfort such as never yet tasted
the Cross, against sharp showers and tempests of tribulations to come.

Verses. 14, 15. 16. 17. 18. and. 19.
14 For this cause I bovv my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15 (Of whom is named the whole family in heaven and in earth)

16 That he might grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye
may be strengthened by his spirit, in the inner man,

17 That Christ may dvvell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and
grounded in love,

18 May be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and
length, and depth, and height:

19 And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that ye may be
filled with all fullness of God.

For this thing sake I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
of whom all Fatherhood is named in Heaven and in earth, that he would give you,
according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power by his
spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye
might be rooted and grounded in love, and may be able to comprehend with all
Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height: and to know
the love of Christ, which passes (or is above) knowledge, that ye might be
filled with all fullness of God. THis is the third part of this Chapter,
containing a testimony or witnesse-bearing of Saint Paul's prayer for the
Ephesians, which prayer has three circumstaunces, the first whereof is
concerning God, whom Saint Paul does call upon, who is the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

The second contains a reason why God alone should be called upon: to wit,
because upon him alone all fatherly rule and government does depend, both in
heaven and also in earth. The word ( Fatherhood) is here taken for fatherly
rule and government. Now, seeing he alone is to be called upon, in whose power
the ordering of all things is, it follows, that the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ alone must be called upon. But yet, this speech does not exclude the
Son and the holy Ghost: because there is one divine essence or being,
power, and glory of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.

The third circumstance contains a rehearsal of those things, which the
Apostle wishes to the Ephesians: to wit, that in the partaking and possessing
of heavenly things, they might be very rich and plentiful. But the Apostle
does first make his rehearsal, and afterward in the end compriseth all things
in general.

But because in this point of doctrine, there is much to be marked, I will lay
it down in parts, to the end, that every thing may the plainlier be
considered, and the more easily applied to our use.

The first part therefore of Saint Paul's prayer is contained in these words: (
That he might grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may
be strengthened by his spirit, in the inner man.) Here S. Paul wishes to
the Ephesians spiritual strength: and he shows the fountain from whence
every good thing flows unto all creatures: to wit, ( The riches of his
glory,) that is to say, the everlasting and bottomless mercy of God. When
we are praieng therefore, what must we do? reckon up our merits and
deseruings? No, but boldly trusting to Gods exceeding great goodness and
clemency, we must pray with faith in Christ. So prays David, Psalm. 51. 1.
saying: Miserere, etc. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great
mercy, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. He adds the cause
efficient, or the working cause, which is inward: to wit, the holy Ghost,
whereby we are strengthened: and what manner of strength it is, which he wishes
unto them, he expresses in these words, saying: ( That your inner man may be
strong in the Lord.) Now, our inner man is our soul, so far forth as it is
broken and trained up in obedience unto God: such a soul as minds inward
things, and not outward, eternal and heavenly things, not temporal and
earthly things. The studies and endeavors of the outward man are diverse from
this. For he neglecting that which is inward and heavenly, is buisie in
outward, temporal, and earthly toies and trash.

The second circumstance is declared in these words: ( That Christ may dwell
in your hearts by faith.) This circumstance shows plainly from whence the
strength of Christians does come. For it defines our strength, to be Christ
himself. But how? Even by dwelling in us. How is this dwelling brought to
pass? Even by faith. Where, or in what part of us? Even in our hearts. For it
is not enough to have a kind of knowledge of Christ, it skils not what, or
how: but the affection of the heart must be present, which is a steadfast
confidence in Christ, with which confidence being armed, we cannot be
overcome, but are able to withstand hell gates, according to that saying of S.
John, 1. John. 5. 4
Haec est victoria, etc. This is the victory which overcomes the world, even
your faith. This place deserves chiefly to be marked. For it does not only
teach, that Christ dwells by faith in them that believe: but it disproueth
the Papists, which define faith to be a certain knowledge and agreeing to the
The meaning of this place is before set down.
story, without confidence of heart.

The third circumstance, ( That ye may be rooted and grounded in love,)
teaches us what is the force of faith, in respect of our neighbor. For, so
soon as he had made mention of faith, by and by he sets down the effect
or fruit of the same: to wit, true and hearty love toward our neighbor:
which he does for a double purpose: namely, to show the true quality of
faith: and also to teach us, in what thing the perfection of Christians does
consist. But what manner of love does faith require? Forsooth, such a love as
is rooted and grounded: that is to say, such a love as is sound and steddie,
which is not moved and made to vanish like smoke, upon every light occasion.
Heerehence let us learn, that how much more we profit and do good in the
school of Christ: so much more we grow and increase in the works of love,
and are, as it were rooted. For it cannot be, that he should be void of love,
which possesses Christ truly by faith.

The fourth circumstance is, ( That ye may be able to comprehend with all
Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and higth:) to wit, of the
mystery of Gods grace, and Christ's love toward us. For so the Apostle
expounds himself, saying: That ye may know the unmeasurable love of Christ
toward you. For as the mercy of God the Father passes all his works,
according to the words of David: Psalm. 145. 9
so the love of God the Son, is beyond all measure also. For, if thou
beholdest the breadth thereof, it cannot be compassed within any bounds: if
thou considerest the length thereof, it reaches even to all the ends of the
world: if thou cast thine eyes upon the deapth thereof, it stoopeth down, even
to the vilest and basest things in the world: if thou look aloft upon the
higth thereof, it is far above the heavens. This is the plain and true
meaning of this place: as for the trifles and toies of the Lords wooden
cross, and of the round globe or compass of the whole world, let us leave
them, they are nothing: and therefore let them go.

This place ministers a most fruitful comfort against all lets and
impediments, which seem to hinder our salvation. For, if Christ loves us so
dearly, it cannot be, (so that we abide in him by faith, even to the end)
that any creture should cast a block between us and our salvation.

The fifth circumstance, ( That ye may be filled with all fulness of GOD)
comprehends in a sum, whatsoever belongs to that perfection and fullness,
which GOD requires of us. Now, the fullness of God, is Christian perfection,
whereby we do fully, that is to say, without colorable dissembling and
hypocrisy, submit our selves unto God. Such are all they, which keep the
faith, and a good conscience.

Heerehence we learn, in what things Christians must chiefly find themselves
occupied: namely, in laboring more and more to come by perfection. For there
is none, that has profited and done so much good in the school of Christ, but
has need of increase. Here therefore is their vanity and peevishness
reproved, which having scarslie had any smacke at all of things belonging to
God; and sauouring of heavenly wisdom, think none so spiritual as
themselves, not once minding to profit any more, or to go forward any whit
at all.

Verses. 20. and 21.
20 Unto him therefore that is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all
that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,

21 Be praise in the Church by Christ Jesus, throughout all generations for
ever, Amen.

But unto him that is able to do most abundantly above all that we ask or
think, according to his power working in us, even unto him be glory in the
Church by Jesus Christ, through out all generations from age to age, Amen. THis
is the fourth part of this Chapter, containing a praising or glorifieng of Gods
name, whereinto the Apostle falls, anon after he had made rehearsal of Gods
benefits. For, the whole benefit of our redemption serves heereto, that all
glory might be given to God. Wherefore the Apostle (surely very well) has
shut up the first part of his Epistle with thanksgiving.

Furthermore, because there are diverse circumstances of this place, let us
consider and skanne them severally. The first is, a making mention of Gods (
Power) whereby he is able to do all things whatsoever he will: and will
perform all things whatsoever he has promised. This ( Power) of God should
first of all establish our hope touching Gods promises, then it should be set
against the Devil, death, and hell: yea, against the subtle reasons of the
flesh, whereby the faith of weaklings is oftentimes shaken. Besides these, it
should stir us up to the fear of God: for God by his ( Power) can punish the
stubburne, and make them stoop. Lastly, it may be laid in their way,
which erroniouslie and blasphemouslie rob God of his glory, and give the
same to Saints and Idols.

The second is a mention making of Gods liberality, who bestows upon us
far greater benefits, than either we can crave or conceive. This ought not
only to prick us unto thanksgiving: but to kindle in us a greater and a
feruenter faith.

The third, from whence the desire and delight in us to pray does proceed and
come: namely from hence, because the ( Power) of God is forceable in us: which
( Power) doubtless, is not of flesh, or blood, but of the spirit of God, and
of faith.

The fourth is a pointing out (as it were) of the place, where true glory may
be given to God, which is the Church of the Saints, or congregation of the
faithful. For the Church is a certain Theater in the world, whereon God will
have his glory showed and seen, according to that saying of David: Laus eius
in Ecclesia Sanctorum, Psalm. 149. 1
His praise be in the congregation of Saints.

The fifth is a declaring of the mean or way, whereby glory ought to be given
unto God, ( By Christ Jesus,) says the Apostle. For none can give praise and
glory to God, unless they be in Christ by faith. Therefore says Saint
Ambrose, Per Christum, etc. Through Christ we must give God thanks, because God
gives us all things through Christ.

The sixth is the continuance and long lasting of the praise and glory which is
to be given to God. ( Through out all generations, says the Apostle, for ever,
Amen.) This everlasting praise and glory of God, puts us in mind of two
things. The first is, that we which are the members of Christ, should
perpetually and for ever praise and glorify God in Christ, after the example
of David, Psalm. 119. 164.
who says thus: Septies in die, etc. Seven times a day I have song praises
unto thee, because of the judgments of thy righteousness. The second is, that
we should know, that the Church of God shall perpetually and for ever
remain, and never have end. For, if glory and praise must be given to God (
For ever), and that cannot be done elsewhere, save in the Church, it follows
that the Church shall never be put down, or come to an end. Then seeing it is
so, it shall be preserved and maintained here in this world, till the day of
judgment: and also after the resurrection of all flesh it shall continue in
all eternity and euerlastingnesse, praising and glorifieng God for ever.

THE FOVRTH CHAPTER.
THE SVMME OF THE fourth Chapter.
OYe Ephesians, for so much as ye are called unto so great grace, meet and
requisite it is, that in harmelesnes and uprightness of life ye answer so
holy a calling. Wherefore I exhort you, that ye abandon all Gentilisme or
heathenishnesse, and endeavor your selves to holiness of life.

THE ORDER OF THE fourth Chapter.
AFter Doctrine the Apostle adds exhortations, according to the manner of the
Prophets and Apostles: and first he sets down a general proposition: to
wit, That the Ephesians should walk worthy their vocation. Then, like a
workman, by little and little he proceeds from the causes, and gathers in
what the whole sum consists: namely, in mutual love: whereunto he ioineth
reasons. But least any should abuse the excellency of gifts, to the contempt
and despite of their neighbors, he shows the end of those gifts* wherewith
Christ does beautify his Church. To this also he adds many specialties,
which in a full proposition, as in a generality, are contained, and
interlaceth comparisons of virtues and vices. He puts them in mind of their
former state under Gentilisme or heathenishnesse, to the end that the
filthiness of their offenses being discovered and known, they should give
themselves to holiness of life, and abandon vices. And so, as the former part
of the Epistle is didascalicall, that is to say, tending to instruction, and
contains the doctrine of salvation freely given: even so the latter part
thereof is paraineticall, that is to say, stands upon exhortation, and
frames unto us a Christian life.

THE EXPOSITION OF THE fourth Chapter, with the observation of doctrines
therein contained.
Verses. 1. 2. and. 3.
1 I therefore being prisoner in the Lord, pray you, that ye walk vvorthie
of the vocation whereunto ye are called,

2 With all humbleness of mind, and meekness, with long suffering,
supporting one an other through love,

3 Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

I therefore, which am in bonds for the Lords sake, exhort you that ye walk
worthy of the calling wherewith ye are called, in all lowliness and
meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one an other, in love, doing your
diligence to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. THe
proposition stands upon exhortation or persuasion. For the Apostle exhorts
and persuadeth the Ephesians, to the leading of a life worthy of the Gospel.
In this proposition there are many things to be marked. First, the Apostle
makes mention of his imprisonment, and that not only to declare his
affection toward the Ephesians: who, although he was cast into prison for the
Gospels sake, yet he did not cease to exhort them to things serving for their
salvation: but also that he might grow in countenance and credit among them,
for whose sake he feared not to adventure the uttermost dangers. In this place
therefore let the ministers of the Gospel be admonished, of the lot and
cross, that is common to them all, which they are compelled to bear, through
the tyranny of this unthankful world: and by the example of S. Paul, let
them learn to be constant, least through accustomed unthankfulness they
renounce their profession, and leave the standing wherein God has placed them.
(...) to suffer for the profession of (...); but rather an exceeding glory.
For to (...) the greatest dangers of all, with a willing mind, for the gospel
sake, is a certain seal (as it were) of their doctrine.

Secondly, when the Apostle says, ( I pray you that you walk worthy of the
vocation whereunto ye are called,) he compriseth in a sum, what beseems
Christians, which are called to the partaking of heavenly grace. Now, in this
place that general vocation or calling of all Christians is to be understood,
whereby we are called from darkness, to light: from sin, to righteousness:
from curse, to blessing: from death, to life: from damnation, to justification
and salvation: from hell, to heaven: to be short, from the kingdom of the
Devil, which is full of all kind of miseries, to the glorious kingdom of
Christ. This wonderful changing of our condition, ought worthily to stir
us up to thankfulness. For, if in the world, he that discharges his office
notably, and is advanced into higher place of promotion, thinks it a
filthy thing, to stain his degree of honor with some foul fault: and on the
other side, who soever outreacheth the rest, in virtue and noble deeds,
brings the more beauty and renown to his place: what shall we say of them,
which have obtained this dignity, to be called and counted not only Holy
Prophets, Kings, or Spiritual Priests: but also The children of God. This
necessity therefore of changing the condition of our former state, being
badde, into a better, is diligently to be considered, that it might stir us
up to lead a life worthy of so great and excellent a calling, in all
soberness, righteousness, and holiness. For we are called (as Saint Paul
says elsewhere) Not unto filthiness, 1. Cor. 1. 2.
but unto sanctification and holiness. 2. Cor. 7. 1.
Heereto serves that place also of the Apostle to Titus: 1. These. 4. 7
Apparuit gratia, Tit. 2. 11. 12. 13. 14.
etc. The grace of God, that brings salvation unto all men, has appeared:
and teaches us that we should deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and that
we should live soberlie, and righteouslie, and godly in this present world:
looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the mighty God,
and of our Savior Jesus Christ: who gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and purge us to be a peculiar people unto
himself, zealous of good works.

Thirdly, because the Apostle is exhorting the Ephesians to ( Unity of
spirit,) that is to say, to concord and agreement, he lays the foundations
thereof, whiles he requires at their hands, ( Humbleness of mind, meekness,
long suffering, and bearing one with an other through love.) Of these Christian
virtues I will say somewhat, to the end that the differencies and properties
of them may the better be seen and known.

( Humbleness,) which the Greeks call (...), is a virtue of the mind, which
does so rule a godly man, that he thinks not too well, either of himself,
or of his gifts: but rather abaseth himself under all men, in the fear of
God, giving to God all glory and praise. This virtue is the very next fruit
of true repentance, which takes unto it daily new increasings, so that it be
true and natural, and not false and counterfeit. Now, this holy (
Humbleness) increseth and grows by four things. The first is, by the
acknowledgement of our own unableness and weakness. The second is, by
considering the end of Gods gifts, which he has given us: for our gifts are
diverse. And why? Even that the benefit of them may be common: that is to
say, to the edifieng one of another, in the body of Christ. The third is, by
binding our selves to serve others, according to the parable in the Gospel.
For, Of him which has more, more shall be required. The fourth is, by thinking
thoroughly upon Gods counsel, purpose, and providence, who oftentimes brings
to pass, that they which seem to have but small gifts, bestow more travel
in building up Gods Church, than they which excel in diversity of gifts.

( Meekness) follows Humbleness aptly, after the Apostles order: and it is
the child as it were of Humbleness. Now, ( Meekness,) which the Greeks call
(...), is a kind of calmness in the mind, whereby as any one bridleth
himself from being angry or wroth: so he shows himself gentle and fair
spoken to others. The contraries to this, are fierceness, madness,
frowardness, stubbornness, waiwardnesse, and such like vices, which turn the
calmness of the mind, into a storm and tempest.

( Long suffering,) which the Greeks call (...): the Latinists, Longanimitas:
is a companion of Meekness: and it is a certain mildness of the mind,
giving place unto wrong, and parting from ones own right, for quietness sake.
For so Saint Paul seems to define this virtue, when he adds these words, (
Supporting one another through love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the
spirit,) that is, the concord or agreement of minds, ( In the bond of peace.)
For love knitteth us together as it were with linkes: even as the members of
the body, being fastened together by ioints, are ruled by one spirit. When
therefore the heart is reformed by Gods spirit, and brought under, by true
humbleness, meekness, and long suffering, we shall then well enough away
with others, amend them that have done amiss, and also love one another with
true love, according to the Lords commandment.

This place of the Apostle is diligently to be marked. For he shows, at what
thing the true agreement of minds in the Saints must take beginning: namely,
at the rooting out of all such vices, as are plagues to concord and unity:
such are these, haughtiness, hastiness, frowardness, fierceness,
waiwardnesse, etc. Heereto serves the saying of Solomon, Pro. 13. 10
Only by pride does man make contention. Matt. 11. 29.
And Christ says, Learn of me, because I am meek and humble in heart. In
which words Christ commands the bridling of two affections: namely, desire
of reuengement, and pride. For as ( Humbleness) of heart is flat against
pride: so is ( Meekness) flat against desire of reuengement. Christ says,
that the brideling of these affections, is the bearing of his yoke. For he that
has found rest in Christ, and a refreshing after his labors, and an
acquittance from the Law which condemns, ought not thereupon to take
liberty to sin: but (...), being raised up and comforted by the grace of
Christ, to take up Christ's yoke, and to chain in the lewd lusts of the flesh.

This yoke of Christ shall not then be cumbersome or tedious unto us, but easy
and light, when we are once used to ( Meekness and humbleness,) after his
example, being propt up with true confidence and belief in him. Contrariwise,
such as hold scorn to carry the yoke of Christ, let them hardly (even as
they deserve) be made subject to the rule and power of the Devil, and lie
trodden under his feet. For it cannot otherwise be, but that every one of us
must bear the yoke, either of Christ, or else of Christ's adversary.

Verses. 4. 5. and. 6.
4 There is one body, and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of
your vocation.

5 There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism.

6 One God and Father of all, which is above all, and through (...), and in
you all.

There is one body and one spirit, even as ye are also called in one hope of
your calling. There is ou^ one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
Father (...) all which is above all, and through all, and in you all. THis is a
confirmation of the proposition, wherein is set down before us, a heap of
reasons or arguments, all which hang upon this one principle: That which is
one, ought in no case to be at strife and debate with it self. The assumption
or minor is this: The Church is one: heervpon follows the conclusion, which
is this, Ergo the Church ought in no case to be at strife and debate with it
self. The assumption or minor, because it is to be proved, is confirmed with
store of reasons. But that all things may be known at the full, we will
consider every thing by it self severally, and that briefly.

First therefore he says, that ( There is one body, and one spirit,) that is
to say, Even as Christians are the members of one and the self same body: 1.
Co. 12. 12
so it is meet, that they being quickened by one and the self same spirit,
should agree together in holy love. For, as all the members of one and the
self same body, are quickened and governed by one and the self same spirit:
even so must all Christians behave themselves one toward another, that they
may seem to be lead and guided by one mind and heart, seeing they are all
but one body in Christ. Whosoever therefore departs from unity and concord,
he must needs depart from the body of Christ, which is the Church.

Heerevpon it follows, that they, which maintain not steadfastly holy love
and unity among themselves, do boast and brag of the title of the Church,
all in waste. And least we should suffer our selves to be withdrawn and plucked
away from the Church, under a vain show and counterfaite color of unity,
let us mark the reason of unity, which follows: ( Even as ye are called in
one hope of your vocation,) says the Apostle: that is to say, I would so have
you all to be one, even as ye are called to one and the self same inheritance,
which at this instant ye possess by hope, according to the word of your
calling. It is the Apostles will therefore, that we should not depart from the
word of our calling, that is to say, from the pure doctrine of our calling,
from whence the soundation of love and unity must be fetched. For he that
departs from the Gospel, whereby God calls: he departs from the unity
of the Church, from the which when a man is once separated, it cannot be that
he should be governed by the spirit: even as any member or limme of the body,
being cut off from the body, is no more ruled by the life, which is in the
body.

Now follows the heap of reasons. ( There is one Lord,) to wit, of the
Catholic or universal Church: namely, Christ Jesus, whom all the faithful
ought of duty to serve, in unity of spirit, and agreement of mind. For, if it
be a foul and reproachful thing, that household servant, which have but one
and the self same earthly master, should fall out and brall among
themselves: and not rather with one consent and agreement do that which they
are commanded: what (I beseech you) shall be more foul and reproachful, than
that Christians, which have but one master in heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ,
should be at disagreement and defiaunce among themselves? specially, seeing
there is ( But one faith) of all in him, whereby they stay and rest themselves
upon him alone, being the only Lord and alone redeemer of all: which ( Faith)
indeed, seeing it is but one and the self same: that is to say, of one and
the self same promise: it is meet, that they to whom this ( One faith) is
given, should also maintain among themselves, one unity, or oneness.

To this also belongs that which follows. ( One baptism:) to wit, common
to all, whereby we are ingraffed into Christ's body, and as it were incorporate
with him. ( One God and Father of all, which is above all, and through all, and
in you all:) that is to say, which rules over all, and by his providence and
government orders and disposes all, dwelling in all the godly by faith. And
although these words, ( Above all, and through all,) may be referred to the
universal government and rule of all things: yet the circumstanunce of the
place makes a restraint, so that they are to be applied to the Church,
chiefly in this place. The meaning of the words therefore is this, ( Above all)
notes the sovereign rule of one God over the Church: ( Through all,)
betokens his providence over spreading all and every member of the Church: (
In all) signifies the coupling or knitting of us together with Christ.
Whosoever therefore breaks brotherly love or agreement, he neither knows
nor confesses these three doctrines. To be brief, whosoever is not moved with
these reasons and arguments of unity, to desire and endeavor to live in love
and concord, we may well enough think that he or she has not so much as one
little crumbe of the same in them.

Verse. 7.
7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the
gift of Christ. But unto every one of us grace is given, according to the
measure of Christ's gift. THis is a figure called Prolepsis, and may be called
in English, Presumption, whereby the Apostle cutteth off a quarrellous demand.
If all things, which are here rehearsed, are common the Christians, how then
comes it to pass, that we are not equal in gifts belonging to the Church?
Why has this man a greater gift, and that man a lesser? Surely this unequal
giving of gifts, is the seed of strife and envy: as may be seen in the
Corinthians, and in many others.

The Apostle answers, that grace is given to every one, even as it pleases
Christ, who bestows his gifts, not only to the private uses of every one
for himself, but also to the profit, maintenance, and preservation of the
whole body: to wit, that one should edify another with their gifts, in the
body of Christ. Having therefore showed the author and giver of diverse gifts
in the Church, he cutteth off all matter of boasting, and all cause of
despising others, which seem to have received smaller gifts. If many would
consider this well, they would not swell so much in their own wisdom, but
every one would serve other the more, with their gifts, through love. Let us
therefore learn heerehence, to be content both with our estate, and gifts:
and to lay out upon the edifieng one of another, whatsoever gifts the Lord of
life has lent us.

Verse. 8.
8 Wherefore he says, When he ascended up on high, he lead captivity captive,
and gave gifts unto men. Wherefore he says, When he ascended up on high, he
lead captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. BY the testimony of David he
proves, that Christ is the Author of all such gifts, as every several
member has in the Church. Now this testimony is well to be marked, because it
contains a Prophecy concerning the triumph of Christ ascending up into
heaven, which triumph David saw in spirit, a thousand years before it came to
pass. This testimony is taken out of the 68. Psalm, which is a praising of
Christ triumphant, whom David confesses openly to be Jehovah, Psalm. 68. 4.
that is, the true God.

Furthermore, this verse of the Apostle, borrowed of David, contains two
things. The first, a Prophecy of Christ's ascending into heaven. The second, a
double fruit of his glorious ascending: the first whereof is, his triumph over
death, sin, hell, and the Devils kingdom, which is to be understood under
this word ( Captivity.) This triumph, as it began in Christ our head: so it
shall be ended in the rest of his body, which is his Church, at such time as
we shall all rise again, at the commandment and voice of Christ. For then
shall all the godly enioie everlasting victory with Christ, their enemies
being vanquished and shaken off with shame. The thinking upon this our triumph
to come, ought of right to comfort us, when we be kept under the Cross. For
he, which is certain of a glorious deliverance, sets less by his present
greeuance.

The second fruit of the Lords ascending, which the Apostle touches, is
contained in these words, ( And gave gifts unto men.) For, to this purpose
Christ ascended, that he might deal gifts unto his Church, whereby she might
be edified and maintained in this life. For, as on the day of Pentecost, he
sent the holy Ghost down to his Apostles, appearing in a visible shape unto
them, and likewise gave them power against the Devil and his members: even so
at this day also, the same Lord Jesus beautifieth his Church with diverse
gifts, and he alone mainteineth the same, never purposing to forsake and leave
her unprovided.

Heerehence therefore let us fetch comfort, when we lie groaning under the
Cross. For, although the Devil sets upon the Church, with sundry kinds
of engines, and by subtle snares violently rusheth upon every member of the
same: yet shall he not in triumph tread still upon her neck, and keep her
under always, though she be held down for a time. For Christ is the
triumpher, who sitting at the right hand of God, maintains his Church,
defends her, and strengthens her: yea, he comfort all and every one of
her members with his holy spirit.

Verses. 9. and. 10.
9 Now, in that he ascended, what is it, but that he had also descended first
into the lowest parts of the earth?

10 He that descended, is even the same that ascended, far above all heavens,
that he might fill all things.

Now, that he ascended, what means it, but that he also descended first
into the lower parts of the earth. He that descended, is even the self same
that ascended above all heavens, that he might fill all things. THese words
must be read in a Parenthesis. For, out of the testimony of the Psalmist
already cited, the Apostle gathers two things, by the figure of Digression.
The one is of Christ's abasing: the other of his glorifieng. For, in that ( He
ascended) he signifies that ( His descending), that is to say, his abasing
went before, which came to pass, by taking upon him man's nature, by his
passion, and by his death. This argument or reason of the Apostle were
altogether weak, if he had not understood and known, that the word which was
in the beginning, and everlasting, abased himself, in taking upon him the
shape of a servant, wherein he was also mad? obedient even to the death of
the cross. Again, in that he ( Ascended), Saint Paul gathers the
glorifieng of Christ, and his power, whereby he now fulfilleth all things,
which make for the perfect estate of his Church.

Moreover, they which out of this place do conclude, that Christ descended and
went down into hell, and to the place of the damned, build (God wot) upon a
very weak foundation. For, the Apostle here does not make a comparison of
one part of the earth to an other: but compares the whole earth with heaven,
as if he should say: The eternal word vouchsafed to come down from his
heavenly glory, unto us miserable men, which live and are conversant here in
earth, that he might be made man, and become an oblation for mankind.

Furthermore, because the Lord is here said, ( To have ascended far above
all heavens,) there are some which gather thereupon, that the body of Christ is
(...), not limitable. For (as they say) above the heavens there is no place.
But as for this subtle shift, let us leave it to Sophisters and Questionists:
and let us constantly keep and stick to the Articles of our belief, wherein
we confess, that Christ was very man, and cease not yet so to be: wherefore
it is true, that he has a very body, limitable: and a very soul, limitable
likewise, wherewith he shall come at the latter day to judge the quick and
the dead. For, he ascended not to change the nature of his manhood, into the
nature of his Godhead: but, as the Apostle says ( I'o fill all things), and
that by the majesty and power of his godhead, wherewith he will be present
with us, even to the end of the world, according to his promise.

Hereof the Catholic Church of Christ bears witness with us. Saint
Augustine says, Sed quoniam, etc. But because that is true, Mat. 28. 20.
which he speaks: Behold, I am with you even to the end of the world, he is
both gone from us, and he is here among us, and he is come again unto us, and
he has not left or forsaken us. For he carried his body with him into
heaven, he took not away his majesty out of the world. Touching this, read
more in the History of Christ, which we have written upon the first Chapter of
Saint John.

Furthermore, this place of Saint Paul serves unto this end, even that we, by
the example of Christ, should be abased and humbled, and one serve an others
need through love, looking for the communion and partaking of Christ's glory:
we (I say) which here on earth, after Christ's example, succor and make one
of an other, and edify them with diverse and sundry duties and services in
the body of Christ.

Verses. 11. 12. 13.
11 He therefore gave some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some
Evangelists, and some Pastors, and Teachers.

12 For the gathering together of the Saints, for the work of the ministry,
and for the edification of the body of Christ,

13 Till we all mere together, (in the unity of faith, and knowledge of the
son of God,) unto to a perfect man, and unto the measure of the age of the
fullness of Christ.

And he in deed gave some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some
Evangelists, and some Pastors, (or Shepherds,) and some Doctors, (or
Teachers) for the restoring of the Saints to the work of the ministry, and
to the edifieng of the body of Christ, till we all meet together in the
unity of faith and knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, to the
measure of the age of Christ's fullness. THis is a rehearsal of the gifts,
wherewith Christ chiefly beautifieth his Church: and it is a signification
also of the end why these gifts are given, and whereto they are ordained. The
gifts are these, ( Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers.)
Although the last end of these be all one: to wit, ( The edification of the
body of Christ:) yet their offices and charge is diverse, as in the
descriptions of them shall be declared.

The ( Apostles) were the very next men immediately chosen of Christ,
appointed and ordained to teach and preach the Gospel, and that not in some
certain place, but every where throughout the whole world, according to this
commandment of Christ, Mark. 16. 15.
Ite in vniuersum, etc. Go ye over all the world, and preach the Gospel to
every creature, etc. Such were those twelve, which are also peculiarly called
by the names of ( Apostles.) To these was S. Paul also afterward joined, Mat.
10. 2 3. 4.
who was chiefly appointed an ( Apostle) for the Gentiles, that he might
carry the name of Christ among them. But, because this order and degree of men
was made, that by them God might have his Churches gathered together and
established throughout the whole compass of the world: therefore ceased they
(the Apostles I mean) when the Churches were thus by them set in order and
edified.

Of ( Prophets) we may make two orders, whereof the one was in the old
Testament, the other in the new. The ( Prophets) of the old Testament were
they, which being taught by special revelation from Heaven, even of God
himself, prophesied of things to come: which when they came to pass,
warranted the hearers of their words, that their prophetical doctrine was not
void of truth. The events therefore, and fallings out of their prophesies, and
the successes of the same, were certain seals of that heavenly doctrine
which they delivered to the Church. The ( Prophets) in the new Testament, were
men endued with singular wisdom, whose charge and office it was, not only
to expound the Scriptures, but also to govern and keep in order the
Churches, which the Apostles had assembled and edified: and that one while in
one place, an other while in an other place, even as it pleased the Apostles.
This order therefore was likewise temporal, and had but his time.

The ( Evangelists) were companie-keepers with the Apostles. For the Apostles
joined the ( Evangelists) with them, for the easing of their labors. And
although these also preached the Gospel, as the Apostles did: yet
notwithstanding, they were of a lower degree than the Prophets. Such were
Titus, Syluanus, Apollo, Marcus, Lucas, and Timothy, whom Saint Paul
exhorts to do the work of an ( Evangelist: 2. Tim. 4. 5
) which work appears to have been inioined to the Apostles, in bestowing
their travel in preaching the Gospel of Christ every where. The (
Evangelists) therefore were not sent next and immediately of Christ, as the
Apostles were. They had not the over sight and rule of the Churches, now these,
now those, which the Apostles had planted, as the Prophets did: but they were
the Apostles companions only, whose help and service they used, in the
discharging of their office. And although that the name of an ( Evangelist)
signifies generally, any Preacher of the Gospel, whom ye will: yet
notwithstanding, it is here taken for one certain charge and office, as we
have already showed. Sometimes also those four, which wrote the history of
our Lord Jesus Christ, commonly called the Gospelles, are named (
Evangelists), of whom two were likewise Apostles: to wit, Saint Matthew, and
Saint John: and two were companie-keepers with the Apostles: namely, S. Mark,
and Saint Luke.

Those were ( Pastors), whom at this day we call the Rectors or Ministers of
Parishes, (some, after the old fashion, Parish Priests.) These were appointed
and set over certain Churches, that by preaching or making of Sermons, by
ministering the Sacraments, and by a kind of holy discipline and order, they
should rule and govern them. These are not for a time, but for ever, even to
the day of judgment: their office is so needful in the Church.

They are ( Teachers,) whom the Church in old time called by the name of
Catechisers: whose office was to set down a form and order of doctrine, and
to deliver certain foundations and grounds of doctrine, which the Pastors
afterward should tie themselves unto, and diligently follow. Such are they
which at this day teach and instruct youth in schools the principles and
rules of Christian religion. These have an eye to this: to wit, that true
expounding, and right order in teaching, be kept in the Church.

But although in the Apostles time, the ceremony of promotion and preferment
was not received, which at this day is in use: yet notwithstanding, thus much
we must know, that the godly governors of Churches and schools, ordained
degrees of promotions upon good and profitable aduisement: both that the
arrogant and hautie hearted, should not usurp and challenge unto themselves
the title of honor and worship, without the judgment of the Church: and also,
that by open witness they might be warranted fit for that place and office,
and grow in countenance and estimation. Neither is this against the dignity
of the Or Churches holy government.
ecclesiastical Hierarchy: which the holy Ghost commends unto us. For,
when the holy Ghost commends unto the Ephesians an order and comeliness to
be kept, he leaves unto himself, the authority to establish and make rites
and ceremonies, which do tend unto the keeping of order and comeliness.

There is no cause therefore, that we should care for the speeches of proud
praters, (Devils in deed,) which have these degrees in contempt: so that they,
on whom these degrees are bestowed, remember who they be that so despise them,
and also bethink them, that their places of preferment, are not signs or
tokens of an arrogant ouerlooking and ouerruling of others: but rather open
witnesses of their office and charge, which they owe unto the Church: and to
the performance whereof they are bound, as it were, by sacred and solemn oath.

But the adversaries peradventure lay this in our way. The Church of Christ
should not be acquainted with pomp, she should not be skillful in such things:
let her have the trial and examining of faith and holiness: let her have
prayers, and the laieng on of hands. I answer, that it is not a thing
unworthy for Christians, to bestow upon godly and learned men, testimonies
of their learning and honesty: that the Church should know, to whom she
might safely commit, and boldly put in trust, the government and charge of
doctrine. And although such manner of promotions have been a long time abused,
that makes no matter: so that we reserve and keep in Churches and Schools,
such things as are profitable and necessary: all dross and dregs being
cleansed quite away.

Again, Math. 23. 8.
they trip us in our talk, saying, That the Lord did forbid any to be
called Rabbi, and Masters upon earth, because there is but one Master. I
answer, Mat. 23. 9
that the same Lord says, we must call none Father upon earth: and yet he in
his law gives us commandment to honor our Fathers. Exodus 20. 12.
Wherefore this is to be understood, Mark. 7. 10.
not of the name, but of some other thing which was forbidden. Besides this,
the cirumstance of the place is sufficient disproofe against them, which
shows what this forbidding means. For this follows, Mat. 23. 11. 12.
Qui maximus, etc. He that is greatest amongst you, shall be your Minister,
Again, He that exalts himself, Luke. 14. 11.
shall be brought low.

The Lords will therefore was not by his forbidding, to take away the name of
Father, Master, or Teacher: but all arrogant confidence, and selfe-liking in
us. He will not that we sooth and smooth our selves, if we seem to excel
others in some kind of gifts. He will not that we proudly prefer and
think better of our selves than of others: but that he rather, which is the
greatest, should show himself a minister unto all. He will not that we
should devise and set abroch a new and strange doctrine, but that we should
faithfully follow our only Master Jesus Christ, in matters of salvation.

Now, in that they lay load at us with the saying of S. James, Iam. 3. 1.
Ne sitis multi magistri, etc. My brethren, be not many Masters, knowing
that we shall receive the greater condemnation: that is soon answered. For
Saint James to that his forbidding, adds a reason, saying: In multis, etc.
For in many things we sin all. So that the meaning of this inhibition or
forbidding, is this: I would that ye should not be sharp controllers of other
men's manners.

Now let us come back to the exposition of our text, where the Apostle sets
down the end of those gifts, wherewith Christ has and does beautify his
Church. ( For the gathering together of the Saints for the work of the
ministry, and for the edification of the body of Christ.) To this end
belongs all Christ's bestowing and giving out of his gifts. This ( Gathering
together of the Saints,) is called (...) in Greek, and signifies properly, a
restoring or repairing of a thing decayed: as when the members of the body, as
the bones, or such like, are loose, out of order, or beside their right place:
but afterward set in again, fastened, and made sound and whole, that all and
every part of the body, may be in good making and liking.

Heerehence Saint Paul, who compares the Church to the body, applies the
word to the state of the Church well ordered and governed. The diversity of
gifts therefore, wherewith Christ beautifieth his Church, belongs to the well
ordering and governing of the Church. For to this thing, as it were to the
proper end, these gifts are appointed. This follows, ( For the work of the
ministry,) that we might know, what instrument Gods will is to use, ( For
the gathering together of his Saints:) to wit, ( The ministry of the word.)
Afterward the Apostle expounds this ( Gathering together of the Saints,) and
calls it, ( The edification of the body of Christ,) concerning which we have
said sufficient in the second Chapter.

Now follows an amplification or enlargement, taken from the circumstance of
the time, and the manner of ( the edification of Christ's body, Till we all
meet together in the unity of faith, and knowledge of the son of God:) that
is to say, Till we all are made one in faith and in the knowledge of Christ.
In that he says, ( Till we all meet together,) it is to good purpose. For he
signifies, that it is not one days work for all of us to be made full and
perfect in Christ: but that it must be our daily labor, till at length we
come to that unity of Christ's body, the cause of which ( Unity) is faith.
This ( Knowledge) is not a knowledge only of the mind concerning Christ, but
also a confidence of the heart. For, it is not enough to know that Christ is
God, man, one person in Trinity, King, Prophet, and Priest: unless with
steadfast confidence and boldness we build upon him.

Here the degrees of ( Unity) must be marked, the first whereof is, the (
Knowledge) of Christ: from whence ( Faith) springs. By this ( Faith) we are
ingraffed into Christ, and made as it were of his body. ^eing therefore
ingraffed into him, and made of his body, it is our part, like members of one
and the self same body, to have care and regard one of another health and
good case, through love: this (I say) is our duty, who are joined together
one with another among our selves, by the spirit of Christ. Out of these things
therefore is to be gathered, that the ( Unity) of the Church consists not in
traditions of men, nor in ceremonies, but in the consent of true doctrine and
faith, from whence the love of one another does spring.

Moreover, when it is said, ( Unto a perfect man, and unto the measure of the
age of the fullness of Christ,) the Apostle expresses, by a notable and trim
Metaphore, the increase and growing of the Saints. For, as there are diverse
degrees of age: as, infancy, childhood, middleage, oldage, dotage, etc. so
must Christians grow by little and little, in the faith and knowledge of Christ.
They must not keep still at the nethermost step, and stay there: but they
must go up higher and higher, till they come to perfectness: which
notwithstanding they shall not obtain at full, before they, having put off the
old man, shall be glorified both in soul and body, with a blessed life.

These words therefore of the Apostle must not be referred to the body, which
is but an idle lump: but to the light of the mind, and the affection of the
heart: to wit, that we should know Christ truly, and lean upon him with a
lively faith, that we should not be wavering, like children, who by reason of
their young years have not a settled judgment: but like men grown to full
age, whose judgment being steddie, they constantly maintain the truth.

For, whatsoever is here spoken of the body, and of the ( Measure of age,) it
is to be applied unto the spirit, and the increase of the same. For, as the
Lord himself grew in body, till such time as he became ( A perfect man,) and
had the just measure of his full age: even so we must grow in faith, and the
knowledge of Christ, till we are come to perfectness. This to be the true and
natural meaning of Saint Paul's words, that which follows is witness. For
the Apostle is not in hand here with our bodies, wherewith we shall rise
again: as some very unadvisedly do gather in this place. For that makes
never a whit for the drift of this present discourse.

Verse. 14.
14 That we henceforth be no more children, wavering, and carried about with
every vvinde of doctrine, by the deceit of men, and with craftiness, whereby
they lay in wait to deceive. That we should be children no more, to waver,
and be carried about with every blast of doctrine, by the wiliness of men, by
craftiness, (or snares of deceit.) THe Apostle declares and shows the
fruit of the sound knowledge of Christ, and of faith. For, the sound knowledge
of Christ, and a steadfast faith, strengthen the minds of men against all such
tempests, as the soldiers of Satan, dare or shall raise up against the
Church. For, they that are not endued with the sound knowledge of Christ, and
with faith, they easily stagger, and reele. And as a little ship or small
bark, not having a Pilot to rule and guide it, is driven hither and thither
with the waves and stream: or as a reed is shaken to and fro, according to
the variableness of the wind: even so they are carried away from true
doctrine, by deceivers and Heretics. We have therefore commended unto us
here, the word, and an earnest study and endeavor in the word, that thereby
we may be so confirmed, as not to suffer our selves to be withdrawn from the
same, by any craft or deceit.

Furthermore, he names two weapons, which deceivers use against the Church:
not that these are all, as though they had no more: but because these are the
principal and chief. The first is (...), which signifies properly, the
casting of the dice, or dice-plaie, from whence Saint Paul borrowing it,
applies it unto subtle sophistry, or witty wiles to wrest the scripture,
and to deceipts, wherewith the ignorant and unlearned are easily ensnared and
taken. The second is (...), whereby is signified, a certain kind of
craftiness, or subtle fetching in of a man: when one does all that he can for
his life, by wiles to wind in another, and so to deceive him.

This the Apostles expounds himself, when he says: ( Whereby they lay in
wait to deceive,) that to say, by which deceiptfull deed of theirs, and
crafty dealing, they lay sore at men to draw them from the truth. Let these
things admonish us, not only of the danger that comes by false teachers,
which go to work all the ways they can, maliciously to turn men from the
true knowledge of Christ, and from faith: and also of diligence and endeavor,
that we being established in true doctrine, may be able both to defend our
selves against all the snares of deceivers, and also to stop their mouths.

Verse. 15.
15 But let us follow the truth in love, and in all things grovve up into
him, which is the head, that is Christ. But following the truth in love, let
us grown up in him through all things, which is the head, even Christ. THis is
an Antithesis, or opposition, to the former member. For as he made mention
there, that we should take heed of false doctrine, and of snares which
deceivers lay to choke the true doctrine: so here he bids us ( Follow the
truth,) that is to say, stick to the true doctrine, and in the faith. (For he
uses the figure Synecdoche, whereby under the word ( Truth) is also comprised
the affection following, according to the manner of the scripture,) ( And in
love one toward another:) whereby it shall come to pass, that we shall (
Grow up into Christ himself,) (...), every way, ( In all things,) he being
our head. For, how much more we grow in the knowledge of Christ, in faith, and
( In love:) so much more we grow in Christ.

As children therefore grow by little and little, till they are come to their
perfect age: even so it is the duty of Christians, to grow day by day in
the knowledge of Christ, in faith, and in love, and never to cease till they
have gotten perfectness. All this serves heereto, that we should submit our
selves unto Christ our head, and maintain unity among us one with another, as
we are all ruled by one and the same spirit of Christ.

Furthermore, Christ is said to be the head of the Church, in working, in
perfection, in merit, and in order. In working, because he quickens,
sustaineth, and keeps the Church by his spirit. In perfection, because he
excels both Angels and men in wisdom and righteousness. In merit, because
he has taken away our sins by his obedience of the cross: and by the
obedience of the law, has made satisfaction to the righteousness of God,
that as many as do believe in him, should be counted righteous, through the
righteousness of Christ. In order, because he is the Monarch and only
Sovereign of the Church.

Verse. 16.
16 By whom all the body being coupled and knit together, by every joint,
for the furniture thereof, (according to the effectual power, which is in the
measure of every part,) receives increase of the body, unto the edifieng of
it self in love. By whom the whole body being coupled and knit together, by
every joint, wherewith one ministers (or serves) another, according to the
operation (or working) in measure of every part, causes (or makes) the
increase of the body, unto the edifieng of it self through love. THe Apostle
gives a reason, why he calls Christ the head of the Church: and the Church
the body of Christ. Although this place appears at the first blush very
obscure and dark: yet notwithstanding, the meaning shall be very easy, when
the words are made plain, and the similitude, which the Apostle does not
express here, is also declared. He calls the Church ( A body,) howbeit not
any body, what ye will: but ( A body knit together,) or (as Saint Paul
speaks more pithilie) (...), that is to say, so knit and coupled together,
that it may well and fitly be joined to the head: even as an house built and
raised upon the foundation, by the rule and square of the workman. Under this
word therefore, the relation of the body to the head, that is to say, of the
Church unto Christ, is meant, and understood.

Afterward, the Apostle says, that the Church is ( A body knit together by
ioints:) the Greek word is, (...), that is to say, so coupled and fastened,
that the members of the same hang one upon another in due proportion, and agree
very well together. And thus the relation and proportion of the members
between themselves, one with another, is signified (as you see,) under this
word. He says this body is ( Knit together by every joint, for the furniture
thereof:) that is to say, by ioints, which carry breath and life from one
limme to another: which breath and life is dispersed from the head, through all
and every member of the body, even by the benefit and good service of the
ioints, by whose means the members of the body, hang one by another, (
According to the effectual power of every part,) that is to say, of every
member. For some members receive, and have more breath and life from the head
than other some, whereby the whole body takes increase.

Now, the similitude shall be easier to understand. As the body of man is to the
head, even so is the Church of Christ unto Christ her head: but the body of
man joined unto the head, and knit together by ioints in every member, by due
proportion and order, receives all breath and life from the head: Ergo the
Church of Christ joined unto Christ her head by faith, and made fit by sundry
sorts of services and uses of love between themselves, as it were members,
draws all ableness, and life from her head, even Christ Jesus. Or if you
please, frame the similitude in this manner.

As breath and life descending or coming down from the brain, by and through
the sinews, veins, and artires, brings feeling and liveliness unto all the
members, according to the proportion of every one in his kind: even so Christ
gives unto us, who are his members, his gifts, and that not at hap hazard or
rashly, but according to the measure of every member: that is to say, as
every member is able to receive and take: and thus he makes the whole body
to be builded up, and grow together into him. This point of doctrine delivered
unto us by Saint Paul, offers unto us manifold lessons for our learning. For
first of all, we have to gather heerehence, that all and every of them are out
of the Church, how many soever, which submit not themselves unto Christ, in
the true knowledge of Christ, and in faith: and which setting light by love,
are at daggers drawing one with another, so exceeding great is their hatred
between themselves.

Furthermore, a true and evident description of the Church may heerehence be
taken, that it is An assemble of such as believe in the Gospel, who cleave so
close unto Christ their head, and are so knit and joined together between
themselves, according to the measure of every ones faith, according to the
diversity of the gifts of the holy Ghost, and according to the condition of
callings, that they all, and every of them live and are lead by one and the
self same spirit, and that they succor and maintain one another in mutual
goodwill, charity, and love.

Moreover, this place also shows us the trim, handsome, and neat order of
Christ's Church. For, such is the order of the Church, as of the members of one
and the same body, under one and the same head. Again, this present place
teaches us, what manner of like-suffering and consent, or agreement, there
ought to be among Christians one with another. For, as in one body, when one
member is pained and suffers, the rest of the members, all and every of
them, are partakers of that pain, and suffer therewithal: even so Christians,
who are members of the same body, ought to be like minded one toward another,
that as well in adversity, as in prosperity, one should take part with
another. To this serves the precept of S. Paul, Romans 12. 15.
Gaudete, etc. Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

Finally, and lastly, we must mark, that the Apostle places ( The
edification of the body of Christ,) chiefelie in ( love.) For, by ( love) the
knowledge of Christ is made fruitful, and faith effectual: yea, both of them
are made more notable and excellent. For, where ( love) is not, there
doubtless the knowledge of Christ is but small and slender: as for faith, it
is so little, that there is never a whit. For, according to the measure of
faith, ( love) is more or less.

Verses. 17. 18. and. 19.
17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk
not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,

18 Having their cogitation darkened, and being strangers from the life of
God, thorough the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their
heart.

19 Which being past feeling, have given themsselues unto wantonness, to
work all uncleanness, even with greediness.

This I say therefore and testify in the Lord, that ye walk no more as the
rest of the Gentiles walk, in vanity of their mind, blinded in their
understanding, being strangers from the life of God, through the ignorance
which is in them, because of the hardness of their hearts, which being past
repentance (or sorrow) have given themselves unto wantonness, to commit all
kind of uncleanness with greediness. THe Apostle, upon a general sentence
or clause, frames particular exhortations. First, his admonition is to all,
teaching us from what kind of manners we should abstain: to wit, from the
manners of the Gentiles: which he confirms from contrary causes: and first,
from the beginnings of actions or causes. The beginnings of actions in the
unholy and heathenish Gentiles, he makes to be of three sorts: to wit, The
vanity of their mind, the darkness or blindness of their understanding, and
the hardness of their heart. The ( Mind) is that, which the Philosophers call
(...), to wit, when a man by the light of reason, discerns, perceives, and
judges of things honest and dishonest: but the Apostle avouches that this (
Mind) was vain ( Cogitation or understanding), which in Greek is called
(...), is that natural ability, whereby we devise, determine, remember,
reason, and gather somewhat by and out of those things, which our mind
quietly sees and perceives, without debating or reasoning: but the Apostle
says, that this understanding was darkened or blinded: whereby it came to
pass, that the Gentiles being ignorant of God, became estraunged ( From the
life of God.) Now ( The life of God) in this place is that, whereby God lives
within, in the heart, and upon the which, all ability and desire to do any
good, depends.

Under the word ( Heart) the Apostle compriseth all the lusts and appetites,
attributing ( Hardness) unto them: whereof it comes, that men are not
touched with any sparkle of the fear of God, but rather run headlong
whether so ever their lewd lusts, and filthy affections carry or drive them.
These are the beginnings and causes of moral actions, or behauiours (touching
religion) in the Gentiles, which as yet are not turned unto God.

But that these things may somewhat the more plainly be perceived, we will
enlarge and lighten the same by examples. The ( Mind) of man sees that there
is a God, and judges that he is to be worshipped: which judgment, although it
be true, yet notwithstanding it is here accused of vanity by the Apostle: and
good reason why: even because it vanishes to nothing, and by the corruption
and naughtiness of nature is choked and strangled, before the matter comes
to action and practice.

For, when the ( Understanding) reasons out of this beginning, principle, or
ground, and yet straieth from the true God, and from the right way of
worshipping him, the ( Mind) in deed sees that there is both a God, and that
he also is to be worshipped, but the ( Understanding) in the Babylonians
reasons that Bell, in the Egyptians that Apis, and so in other nations other
idols are to be worshipped: and that one while by oblations of men, an other
while by other rites and ceremonies, the mere devises of men. And this is that
which Saint Paul speaks of, saying, Romans 1. 23
that The Gentiles turned the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
served the creature, forsaking the Creator.

Furthermore, the Apostle adds the fit fruits of such causes: namely, (
Ignorance of God, estraunging from the life of God, and hardness of heart,)
which is, senseless blockishnesse, or numnesse, not suffering them to feel the
greatness and greeuousnesse of their sins, but to grow past all remorse of
conscience or repentance: so that they cease utterly, and altogether leave
off to be sorry for their sins. A certain inclination to all (
Wantonness,) follows this senseless duinesse, or blockishnesse: yea rather,
a certain unbridled desire to sin, which the Apostle terms here by the
name of ( Wantonness.) This greedy lust bursteth out into all kind of
villainies and abominable misbehauiours, which are here noted under the word (
Uncleanness,) all which are increased and made more by ( Greediness,) the
utter adversary to contentation or temperance: until it throw a man down
headlong into the bottomless gulf of damnation. For, (...) is an unmeasurable
lust or desire, which having never enough, is alwais seeking to have more. In
this place is first to be marked, what a wretched creature man is, without the
grace of regeneration, or new birth, after the fall of our first parents: to
wit ( Vain of mind, blind of understanding, and hard in heart:) whereby we may
easily perceive, what manner of free will that is, which the Sophisters and
Schoolmen have in such count, and so highly praise, even in such as are not
regenerate or newborn. If therefore (according to the doctrine of S. Paul)
our intents, our proceedings, and our very doings are faulty and sinful:
what sound thing is remaining? Tell me that. And although the Apostle does
not take from man his natural abilities: yet notwithstanding, he proves that
they were corrupt, after his fall.

Moreover, we have here to mark, that Saint Paul speaks not of actions
natural, or civil, which are ruled and governed by the moving and gesture of
the body. For in these remains some liberty, in such as are not yet
regenerate or borne a new: but he speaks only of the actions which concern
Gods worship and service: of which actions there are three causes. The first
is, the word, which instructs the mind, and frames the judgment. The second
is, the holy Ghost, which is effectual in the word, to the inlightening of
the mind, and the inclination or bending of the will. The third is, the will
of man resting in the word, and giving place to the holy Ghost, of whom it is
both instructed and moved.

Verses. 20. and. 21.
20 But ye have not so learned Christ:

21 If so be ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in
Jesus.

But ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard of him, and
are taught in him, even as the truth is in Jesus. THe Apostle shows the cause
why the Ephesians ought not, (as other hethernish Gentiles do) to live in the
ignorance of the Gospel of Christ: to wit, because they have learned Christ.
For, as a little before, he rehearsed the causes of many foul sins in the
Gentiles, which causes are these: namely, ( The vanity of their mind, the
blindness of their understanding, and the hardness of their heart:) so in
this place he sets flatly against all these, the knowledge of Christ aloue:
and further avouches, that the same is the cause of leading a godly and an
honest life.

This knowledge therefore of Christ ought to breed in us an other manner of
living, than is in the Gentiles, which are not yet (to this day) turned unto
God, by and through the preaching of the Gospel. For, this effectual and
forceable knowledge of Christ, what does it? Forsooth, it reformeth the mind,
it inlighteneth the understanding, and if softeneth the heart: to be short, it
renews the whole man by the spirit of God, that now he begins to live (
The life of God.) And this is that which the Apostle says, ( As the truth is
in Jesus:) that is to say, the true way to live well, set forth unto us in
an excellent and notable example. For, in Christ appeared no kind of mark or
token of the old man: because he bare the very image of the Father, and
being full of the holy Ghost, obeyed his Father in all things. The word (
Truth) therefore does signify, not only the assent of truth, but also the
action which follows the assent: by the figure Synecdoche much used in Hebrew.

This place therefore is diligently to be marked, which teaches, that the
knowledge of Christ, or of the Gospel, is but vain: unless we have joined
therewithal, such manners as are worthy of Christ, and the Gospel. For the
knowledge of the Gospel, stands not upon a naked contemplation or gazing at
things, not in idle disputations, etc: but in the single knoweledge of Christ,
in faith, and in harmelessenesse of life: or, as Saint Paul says elsewhere,
(...), that is to say, In knowledge and understanding.

Verses. 22. 23. and. 24.
22 That is, that ye cast off, concerning the conversation in time past, the
old man, which is corrupt, through the deceiuable lusts,

23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind.

24 And put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness, and
true holiness.

That ye should cast off, (or lay (...) from you) after the former
conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, thorough the concupiscenses of
error: and should be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new
man, which after God is shaped in righteousness and holiness of truth. THe
Apostle declares, in a short rehearsal, but yet full and pithie, what it is,
to have learned Christ truly, what truth is in Jesus, and what manner of life
the life of a Christian ought to be. Of this rehearsal there are three
parts: to wit, ( To put off the old man, to be renewed in the spirit, and to
put on the new man.

The first part therefore, is the putting off of the old man. The ( Old man)
signifies, not the substance, but the quality: namely, vice and corruption,
and all custom of sinning, according to the conversation of old. This custom
of sinning, S. Paul would have all Christians to put off, that the rule and
government of the spirit might be effectual and full: of which thing he
shows the cause ( Which is corrupt through the concupiscences of error,)
that is to say, whom deceiuable lusts do corrupt, whiles they draw men into
corruption and destruction.

Whosoever therefore desires to escape destruction and utter undoing, let him
put off the (Old man). Now the (Old man) is then said to be put off, when the
body of sin is weakened and brought under, that we should serve sin no
more. For so the Apostle expounds his own words, saying, Hoc scientes, etc.
Knowing this, Romans 6. 6.
that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be
destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. In this speech of Saint
Paul, the word (Crucified) must be considered. For by that is signified the
efficacy and working of Christ's cross, and this death in us, to the
crucifieng and mortifieng of the (Old man.) Romans 6. 12 13.
To this serves the exhortation of the Apostle, Neigitur, etc. Let not sin
therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obeie it in the lusts
thereof: neither give you your members as weapons of unrighteousness unto
sin: but give your selves unto God, as they that are alive from the dead, and
give your members as weapons of righteousness unto God. Mat. 10. 38.
This agrees also with the saying of our Savior, Si quis vult, etc. If any
man will come after me, Mat. 16. 24
let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and let him follow me.
Mark. 8. 34.


The second part of the rule here set down is, ( To be rehewed in the spirit
of our mind,) Luke 9. 23.
that is to say, Luke 14. 27
to have our mind made so bright and clear with new light, that the vanity
of our mind, and the blindness of our understanding being chased away, our
inward man may taste, savor, desire, discern, perceive, understand, think
upon, and reason of those things which are of the spirit. 1. Cor. 2. 14.
For, seeing The carnal or natural man, perceives not those things that are
of Gods spirit, it is behoouefull that such a renewing of the spirit be
wrought in us, as thereby we may be able to submit and bring under our selves
to the rule of the spirit.

The third part of the rule is ( To put on the new man, which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness.) Of this part there are three
members. The first is, to put on the new man by forsaking sin, and a renewed
spirit. The second, the quality of the new man: to wit, that he is ( Created
after God:) that is to say, after Gods image or likeness. The third
contains the things wherein that newnes or likeness of God consists: namely,
( Righteousness and true holiness,) with the former whereof we serve men,
according to the tenor of the second table: and with the latter we worship
God purelie and sincerely. The word ( True) stands for a title due unto
holiness: (after the manner of the Hebrew phrase,) whereby is meant, that not
a fained or counterfaite ( Righteousness), not an outward ( Holiness) only,
but a perfect ( Righteousness) and an ( Holiness) of heart, agreeing with the
rule of Gods will, is required. This place of Saint Paul is diligently to be
marked: not only, because it contains briefly, and in a very trim
definition, the parts of a Christian life: but also, because it sets forth
a clear and evident definition of ( Gods image) in man. For, heerehence we
have to understand, that ( The image of God) is a conformity or agreeableness
of man with God ( In righteousness and true holiness). Heerevpon it came,
that our ancients or elders defined Christianity to be an imitation or
following of the divine nature.

Verse. 25.
25 Wherefore cast off lieng, and speak every man truth unto his neighbor,
for we are members one of an other. Wherefore casting away lies, speak ye
the truth, every one to his neighbor, because we are members one of an
other. NOw he gathers the specialties, which rise of the generality, or
general rule, concerning the putting off of the old man, and the putting on
of the new: besides, he rehearses certain members of either man, for examples
sake. The first specialtie is: following ( Truth) and plain dealing: or
singleness and of ( Lieng) that is, of avoiding all manner of coulourable
excuses, and doubleness. The Apostle gathers this specialtie, in this sort:
The old man must be put off, and the new man must be put on, who is created
after God in righteousness and true holiness: Ergo (Truth) is to be followed
as a member of the new man. As for ( Lieng), that must be cut off, and cast
away as a member of the old man, to the end we may live with our neghbours
vprightlie, plainly, and neighborly.

To this specialtie he adds another reason drawn from things jointly knit
together: ( We are, says, he members one of another,) Ergo we ought to
succor and make much one of another, in ( Truth) and honesty, without all
dissembling and deceit. After this sort also the rest of the specialties
following are to be ordered, all which are continued in discourse, by an
Antithesis or opposition, even to the end of the Chapter.

Verses. 26. 27.
26 Be angry, but sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath.

27 Neither give place to the Devil.

Be angry, and sin not: let not the sun set upon your anger, and give not
place to the Devil (or backbiter.) HE exhorts us, that we should not be (
Angry.) But because it happens oftentimes, that even the godly are moved,
when things fall out amiss, and through the weakness of their own nature: it
comes to pass, that they can not be altogether free from ( Anger.)
Wherefore, the first thing that he does, what is it? Even to set a stint, and
to bound in our ( Anger.) Secondly, he gives us counsel and advise.
Thirdly, he adds a reason of his counsel. The stint of our ( Anger) is,
that we should not sin in being ( Angry:) which is done, so often as we be (
Angry) either through our own default, or the default of others. But there is
a kind of praiseworthie ( Anger,) which is kindeled either against our own
sins, to repent and be sorry for them: or against the sins of others, to
correct and punish them: and this only ( Anger) has an eye to Gods glory,
and keeps a certain stint.

But, because it falls out so, that we can not bridle our ( Anger,) but
through our own folly it will draw to it some other sin: the Apostle gives
us counsel, ( That we should not let the sun go down upon our anger or
wrath:) that is to say, that we should not let the sin of ( Anger) rest long
in us: but as it rises with the sun, so to let it fall with the sun. This
self same meaning has Pythagoras his posie, Meaning there by, that our anger
must be no more perceived than the print of a pots foot when the imbers are
raked abroad.
Ollae vestigium cinere turbato, The print of a pots foot, when the ashes be
stirred. For if anger continue any long time, it comes to pass, that the
Devil will enter into that angry man's heart, wholly to possess it: so that
by little and little he shall be swallowed up at length in the gulf of
destruction. And this is the sense of that which the Apostle adds, ( Neither
give place to the Devil.) This place is diligently to be considered, which
bears witness, that the Devil has entrance and room made him to dwell in
the heart of man, ( By anger and wrath.) Seeing it is so, fie upon it: and if
we love our selves, let us fly from ( Anger and wrath,) as from the net and
snare of Satan.

Verse. 28.
28 Let him that stole, steal no more: but let him rather labor and work
with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give unto him
that needs. Let him that did steal, steal no more, but labor rather,
working that which is good with his hands, that he may have to give unto him
that suffers need. Under the name of ( stealth or theft,) the Apostle, by
the figure Synecdoche, understands all devises and ways whatsoever of
deceiving. And as he gives counsel to cut off this ( Theft,) as a member of
the old man: so he requires diligent travel, and earnest labor of every
man in his vocation and calling, as a member of the new man. He adds the end
of this precept: namely, ( That every one may have to give unto him that
needs:) to wit, unto them which either by sickness or old age
being-hindered, are not able to get their living with their hands. This place
is to be marked against thieves and pilferers, which living idelie, devour the
fruits of other men's labors.

Verses. 29. 30.
29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouths: but that which
is good, to the use of edifieng, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

30 And grieve not the holy spirit of God, by whom ye are sealed unto the
day of redemption.

Let no filthy speech come out of your mouths, but if any do, let it be good
and edifieng when need is, that it may give grace to the hearers: and grieve
ye not the holy spirit of God, by whom ye are sealed unto the day of
redemption. AS he exhorts us to cut off filthy speaking and ribauldrie,
being one of the nastiest and fowlest members of the old man: so he gives us
counsel to use good and honest talk, as necessary for edification, being a
member of the new man: that in so doing it might ( Minister grace:) that is to
say, might turn to the profit and commodity of the hearers. For, under this
word ( Grace) any kind of commodity and profit whatsoever is in this place
to be understood.

Furthermore, to his exhortation he ioineth a substantial reason, saying: (
And grieve not the holy spirit of God:) to wit, with your filthy talk. Now
there is here to be marked a double figure. The first is called, (...),
whereby the affections and properties of man, are applied unto God. The second
is Metonymia. For, ( To grieve the spirit,) is to offend the spirit: yea, in
such sort to move him, that he forsakes man utterly, in whom he took up (as
it were) his Inn. For, as a guest being thrust out of his Inn by violence,
feels himself therewith greatly grieved: even so the holy spirit is said
to be grieved, when he forsakes the heart of man, wherein he lodged before by
faith: seeing many a foul sin harbored in the same.

This exhortation of Saint Paul, if it take place among them, which profess
the name of Christians, there would be fewer offenses given by their life, and
greater quietness among men. But lewd custom, men's maliciousness, the devils
temptations, and the wickedness of the flesh, pull on the most part of men
(the more pity) to the contrary, and that not without great offense to the
Church, and the undoubted destruction of many.

The weapons therefore, wherewith we must fight against this ancient lewd
custom, against men's maliciousness, against the devils temptations, and
against the wickedness of the flesh, are faith and prayer. That which the
Apostle adds, ( By whom ye are sealed unto the day of redemption,) has
exceeding great weight in it to exhort. For the holy spirit is an assured
seal, and a certain mark, whereby the godly and elect are discerned from
the wicked and reprobate, even till the day of judgment and redemption, when
we shall be quit and set free from all miseries.

Verses. 31. 32.
31 Let all bitterness, and anger, and wrath, crieng, and evil speaking be
put away from you, with all maliciousness.

32 Be ye courteous one to another, and tender hearted, forgiving one another,
even as God for Christ's sake forgave you.

Let all bitterness, and grudging, and anger, and roaring, and blasphemy, (or
cursed speaking) be removed from you, with all maliciousness (or wickedness.)
And be ye merciful one to another, forgiving one another, even as God forgave
you in Christ. HE persuaded us before to cut off anger, as a certain
ill-fauoured and filthy member of the old man: now he wills us to pare
away quite all the parts thereof, as ioints of this member: and bids us
plant in their places, the virtues which are contrary to these vices.

But because the names of the vices, rehearsed here, are somewhat like in
signification, they are therefore to be discerned and known by their
difference. ( Bitterness,) which in Greek is called (...), is the root of
anger and grudging: this breeds grudging or indignation, which in Greek is
called (...), being a certain fury or madness of the mind thirsting after
reuengement. Indignation or grudging breeds wrath, which bursteth out even to
the deed doing. This wrath, is the mother of ( Crieng or roaring,) that is to
say, of quarrellous words, tending wholly to contention and strife. ( Crieng
or roaring) brings foth ( blasphemy, or cursed and evil speaking,) whereby
one does what he can to nicke another name to raise up an ill report upon him,
and so to seek his discredit and undoing. The Apostles mind is, that all
these sins and ( Maliciousness) also with them, be utterly put away: for
these be the weapons, wherewith men arm themselves, to wound and hurt their
neighbors.

Moreover, the Apostle sets flat against these members of the old man, the
members of the new man: to wit, ( Courtesy, mercifulness, or tender
heartedness, and forgiving one another.) And to the end he might persuade the
Ephesians herein, he brings the principal pattern of all paternes: namely
( God the Father, who for Christ's sake forgave us.) All Christians therefore,
as many as covet like children to boast of so great a Father, it behooves them
to apply themselves to this pattern. For, is it not a filthy thing, that
children should not follow the virtues of their Father, so far as they may?
Luke. 6. 36
Heereto serves the commandment of Christ, Estote misericordes, sicut and
Pater vester coelestis misericors est: Be ye merciful, as your heavenly
Father also is merciful. Saint Ambrose frames the Apostles argument in this
manner: Si Deus per filium suum seruorum misertus est, quanto magis serui ipsi
inuicem sibi debent misereri and donare, sralter in alterum peccet? In English
thus: If God for his sons sake, had compassion of us being but servant: how
much more ought we being servant, to be pitiful, and forgive one another, if
one offend another.

THE FIFTH CHAPTER.
THE SVMME OF THE fifth Chapter.
AS God the Father is to be followed in all holiness and pureness: even so is
mutual love and charity to be maintained, after Christ's example: to the end
that all filthiness and uncleanness being put to flight, we should live
holilie and honestly. Furthermore, subjects must be godly disposed among
themselves, and live Christianlie one with another. And, as it becomes women
to be obedient to their own husbands: even so on the other side, it is the
duty of husbands to love their wives, after the example of Christ, who loves
and tendereth the Church his dear spouse.

THE ORDER AND PARTS of the fifth Chapter.
THe beginning of this fifth Chapter, is concluded upon the last verse of the
fourth Chapter. For, as the Apostle did there take an argument or reason of
mutual goodwill and forgiving one another, even from the example of our
heavenly Father: even so here in the beginning of this fifth Chapter, he
fetteth down another example of the same Father, generally to be followed of
all: and he makes a certain sovereign or principal ground, of the
specialties following. To this example he adds an exhortation to mutual
love, taking his reason from the example of Christ: from whence, (I mean from
the example of the Father and of Christ,) he is carried again to the
specialties, compared by setting contraries against contraries: and he
reckons up diverse duties of Christians not a few, interlacing reasons drawn
from the diversity of our estate, being of two sorts: namely, before the
light of Christ was known, and under grace. Lastly, he enters again into a
general exhortation concerning mutual submission, or dutifulness, which he
divides streight-waies into more specialties, and handeleth two of them at
large in this Chapter. The first whereof is touching the submission, which
women ought of duty to show and perform to their husbands. The second
concerning the duty of husbands, that they should love their wives, even as
Christ loves his Church.

THE EXPOSITION OF THE FIFTH Chapter, with the observation of the doctrines
therein contained.
Verses. 1. 2.
1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children,

2 And walk in love, even as Christ has loved us, and has given himself
for us, to be an offering, and a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor to God.

Be ye therefore followers of God, as beloved children, and walk in love, even
as Christ loved us, and gave himself for us, an oblation and sacrifice of a
good sweet savor unto God. THe example of God set down in the end of the
fourth Chapter in special, I apply in general: to wit, that in all our
actions and doings: yea, in the whole course of our life, we should be (
Followers of God as dear children.) This ( Following) consists in true
holiness, whereby the spirit is kept pure and perfect, and the soul and body
with out complaint: that is to say, it is framed to the rule of Gods will,
declared in his Law. Hereto serves the saying of the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23.
Ipse Deus pacis, etc. The very God of peace sanctify you throughout, that
your whole spirit, and soul, and body, may be kept blameless, unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

This is the ( Following) which God requires, when he says, Leu. 11. 44.
Sancti estote, etc. Be ye holy, because I the Lord am holy, Leuit. 19. 2
and have separated you from other people, Leuet. 20. 7. 8.
that ye should be holy. After the same manner also Christ sets before us
the example of his Father to be followed, 1. Pet. 1. 16.
saying, Estote vos perfecti, etc. Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is
in heaven is perfect. Mat. 5. 48
The Lord in this place requires not an equal perfectness, but a like
perfectness, according to the measure which is in us, till we are come to true
perfectness in deed, which is signified by this word ( Following.)

This place is diligently to be marked. For it teaches, that whosoever will
be in the number of Gods children, they must follow the example of their
heavenly Father, in all holiness and pureness. They that neglect this, and
do it not, wrongfullie take unto themselves the name of children, seeing they
are rather bastards, than lawfully begotten. Hereunto he adds the example
of the Son, whereby he exhorts us to love one an other.

And that this present example might have the more weight, he shows briefly
from the effect, how the love of the Son of God is toward us: to wit, (
Because he has given himself to be an offering and a sacrifice unto God for
us:) that is to say, a slain sacrifice, whereby satisfaction was made to God
for our sins, ( Having a sweet smelling savor,) that is, with which only
sacrifice God was delighted and well pleased. Now there is to be marked in this
place a double figure. First, (...). For the Apostle in this place (after the
example of Moses) puts upon God the person of a man, that he might frame
himself to our capacity and knowledge. Genesis 8. 21.
For thus speaks Moses, Oderatus est odorem suauitatis, The Lord smelt a
savor of sweetness. Secondly, Metalepsis, a figure in great use with the
Hebricians. For, by the sweet smelling savor is understood, a sacrifice
acceptable and pleasing unto God. The Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
using a proper speech, whereby he expounding the phrase of Moses, says:
Talibus hostijs, Heb. 13. 16
etc. With such sacrifices (...), God is only delighted or well pleased.

This Argument of Christ's love toward us, contains in it three things. The
first is, that the death of Christ is the only price of our redemption. The
second, that God performed all these things, vnderserued on our part, of his
mere goodness and love. The third, that the thinking upon this exceeding
great love of Christ, ought rightwell to put us in mind of loving one an
other. Wherefore, if we will be partakers of Christ, let us endeavor our selves
to love one an other: specially, seeing he himself said thus, In hoc
cognoscent homines, etc. By (...) shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
John. 13. 35
if ye have love one to an other, as I have loved you.

Verse. 3.
3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once
named among you, as it becomes Saints. But as for fornication, and all
uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as it
becomes Saints. THe Apostle begins to reckon up such sins as fight with
the true following of God our heavenly Father, to wit, with holiness, which
God will have to be the beauty and ornament of his children: and he sets
down three: namely, ( Fornication,) that is to say, a wandering fleshly
lust: ( Uncleanness) that is to say, all kind of concupiscence, wherewith
the soul and the body is defiled: ( And covetousness,) which quenches and
puts out quite all hope and trust in God, and nourishes up a wicked
confidence in money, as in an idol.

The Apostles mind and will is, to have these vices so weeded up, that they
should not be once named among Christians, much less used. S. Paul seems to
have had ancie unto that place in Deuteronomie, Deuteronomy. 23. 27,
where it is said, Non sit meretrix, etc. There shall be no whore of the
daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a whoore-keeper of the sons of
Israel.

But (alas) the wounds of the Church are justly to be lamented. For these most
filthy and noisome plagues, are not only wantonlie named, but also lawleslie
committed: yea, even of such as brag and boast, that they execute the judgment
of God. But it is the duty of the godly to take heed, least with the
multitude of sinners, and their horrible offenses, they fall into Satan's net,
and so either to blaspheme and slander the word of God, through the lewd
behauiours and beastly manners of such, as will be counted iollie fellows in
the Church of God: or else to be allured by example to follow their filthy
fashions, which is done too soon (God wot) where no heed is taken. For men do
much sooner follow the vice of one, than the virtue of many. Now, the reason
why S. Paul would not have these vices named, stands upon disagreements.
Christians must be holy, Ergo they shall not meddle with any thing that is
beastly and abominable.

Verse. 4.
4 Neither filthiness, neither foolish talking, neither ieasting, which are
things not comlie: but rather giving of thanks. And filthiness, and foolish
talking, and ribauldrie, (or beastly and dishonest ieasting) which become not:
but rather thanksgiving. YEt again the Apostle ioineth three vices together,
which do likewise fall at defiaunce and open fight with the following of God,
and true holiness: against which three vices, he sets the virtue (...) (
Thanksgiving:) a virtue in deed, which does not only signify a prayer
wherein we give God glory, thanks, and praise: but also language or speech
seasoned with comeliness and sweetness. For God loves not that Stoicall
sowrenes., and glummie countenance whereby men are made afraid to be consant
with us: but as his will is to have us gentle and sweet in our life and
conversation one toward an other, so he requires communication seasoned with
godly sweetness.

Furthermore, where the Apostle interlaceth this, ( Which are things not
comely:) it is an argument drawn from disagreements. For all manner of
filthiness, ribauldrie, and dishonest ieasting, either in behavior, or in
talk, is utterly at daggers drawing with the duty of a Christian.

Verse. 5.
5 For this ye know, that no vvhooremonger, neither unclean person, nor
covetous person, which is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom
of Christ, and of God. For this you know, that no whooremonger, or unclean,
or covetous person, or which is an image worshipper, (or idolater) shall
obtain any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God. THe Apostle
adds unto the words going before, a very heavy threatening: or a reason
drawn from the punishment which hangs over the heads of ( Whooremongers,
unclean and covetous persons:) to wit, that they are shut out from the
inheritance of Christ and of God. And no meruell: for (wot you what) a
justifying faith can by no means stand or agree with these plagues.
Nevertheless, hope of pardon and forgiveness is not denied or withheld from
the offender, by this threatening: but the punishment due by desert to such
foul sins is only signified, that the filthiness of sin, being once
known, and the greatness of our guiltiness therein understood by the
punishments, we might fall to repentance, and defy all such filthiness.

For the rule of the Prophet, concerning the repentant, as it is always, so is
it now to be laid fast hold upon: Ezech. 14. 15.
Cum recesserit, etc. When the wicked shall turn from his sin, and do that
which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, Ezech. 33. 11.
and not die. Again, Nolo mortem, etc. I desire not the death of the wicked,
but that the wicked turn from his way, and live. But special heed must be
taken, that we abuse not this rule to the dishonor of God, and our own
destruction. Let us therefore beware, that we run not with full rain into a
lewd custom of sinning, least God give us over into a reprobate mind, and
we become careless of our wicked deeds, minding nothing less than to be
sorry for them.

For, if we set at naught the outcries of the holy Ghost, ringing in our ears
by the preaching of the Gospel, and calling us to repentance: it is to be
feared, that we shall be quite cast away by Gods just judgment, and counted
dead creatures, and damned souls, ordained to eternal torments, before God.
Which punishment doubtless is most worthy, that God therewith should take
vengeance upon the malapert untowardness, sauciness, and peevishness of men.

Verses. 6. and. 7.
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for, for such things comes the
wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

7 Be not therefore companions with them.

Let no man deceive you with vain speches. For by such things comes the
wrath of God, upon the children of disobedience. Be ye not therefore made
partakers with them. IN these words the Apostle uses the figure Prolepsis,
which in English may be called a Presumption, whereby he catches their
objection and excuse by the head, which diminish and lessen the sins above
rehearsed, saying, that they are but escapes and defaults following man's
frailty and weakness: and that God is not so cruel a tyrant, that for such
offenses he will quite cast men away: Moreover, that there were diverse: yea,
even of the most holy Fathers, in all ages and times, which fell in the like:
again, that grace so abounds, as it swalloweth up the sins of the whole
world: and finally, that it is enough, if a man be brought to the repentance
of his sins committed, when he is going out of this world, and giving up the
ghost.

With these and such like reasons, many do miserably deserve themselves,
until they tumble down headlong into everlasting destruction. But yet our
Apostle does admonish the godly in this place, that they suffer not themselves
to be deceived, ensnared, and tangled with ( Vain words), whereby as with a
hook Satan draws them into hell. There is no poison more dangerous, than
are those excuses and delays, which keep, embolden, and harden us in our
sins. For, whosoever listeneth unto such ( Vain words,) and is in liking
with them, say what ye will, he is utterly void of the fear of God. For,
this is proper to the fear of God, (as the son of Syrach says,) even to
drive out and chase away sin.

I say therefore, that we must flee from the speeches of such heathenish and
unholy men, not as from the sweet and entising songs of Sirens, but as from
the deadly stings and wounds of Satan. For, these men turn the judgment of
God, and the rebuking of sins, into toies and merriments. Let us rather be
moved with the examples of the whole world, which for such sins sake, felt
the heavy wrath of God, that is to say, the vengeance of God falling upon (
The children of disobedience:) that is to say, upon stubburne and wilful men.

The flood is a witness hereof, the burning up of Sodom makes it a clear
case, very many ouerthrows, and horrible changes of diverse kingdoms,
Commonwelths, and honorable houses avouch it for a truth. And that it is no
lie, the torments of the wicked, wherewith God will punish their stifneckednesse
and neglect of duty, shall be a sufficent trial. Let us therefore obeie the
holy spirit, exhorting and commanding us ( That we should not be companions
with them:) and let us earnestly and in time fall to repentance of our former
life, least the Lord in his fury most justly cast us off, and give us over
into a reprobate mind, till we grow past grace and be utterly void of any
feeling of sorrow for our sins. Let not the multitude of misliuing sinners
move us, let not lawlesnes be a cloak to cover our shame, let not scaping scot
free, when we have done amiss, deceive us. The punishment is not forgiven or
forgotten, though for a time it be forborne and driven off. Let us not
therefore set light by Gods gentleness, and long suffering, daily calling us
to amendment.

Verse. 8.
8 For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as
children of light. For ye were sometimes darkness, but are now light in the
Lord, as children of light so walk. HE fetches the reason of hisexh ortation,
from a comparison of the Ephesians double estate: to wit, of that wherein they
were before their conversion: and of this wherein they are now placed after
their conversion. For it is meet, that every one should answer in life and
manners, the degree and place wherein he is set: and should also take heed that
he stain not his estate with any spot, least through his own folly and
fault, he fall from that dignity, whereto he was advanced, both to his own
shame and reproach, and also to the ruin and decaie of others, which by their
example are the worse.

The Apostle in this place calls men that are blinded in their sins, and
live altogether disorderedlie and villanouslie, by the term of ( Darkness:)
such are all they, (many, or few,) which are not yet converted or turned by
the Gospel. Now, this figure Metonymi^, has in it great force, as when we
call a wicked man, wickedness it self. The meaning therefore is this.

Before your conversion, (O ye Ephesians,) what were ye? Even men made of the
mere darkness of ignorance and maliciousness: so that there was not one mite
of true and healthful light remaining in you. But now you are light, walk
therefore as children of light. The word ( Light) is attributed and given to
the faithful: both because they are enlightened in themselves with true light:
and also, because they give more light, and shine brighter than others:
insomuch that they do even reprove and find fault with the life of the
wicked: that is to say, make the same more manifest.

This place is principally to be marked, which admonishes us, that the
thinking upon the dignity and worthiness of Christians, ought to be a prick
unto them, to stir them up to live holilie and vnblameablie: both that we
should perform to God ward all due obedience, and also draw others forward by
our example to godliness. Besides that, this place teaches us, that such as
profess themselves to be Christians, and yet live wickedlie, deceive
themselves, and lay themselves wide open to greater danger of damnation. For
they are not the ( Children of light), that is to say, they are not
enlightened with the true light, unless they defy and forsake the works of
darkness.

Verse. 9.
(For the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and
truth.) For the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and
truth. THis Argument is drawn from the cause efficient. We which believe, are
regenerate or newborn, and endued with the spirit of Christ. Now, ( The fruit
of the spirit, is goodness, righteousness, and truth.) Therefore we must do
what we can, by these, to stand against maliciousness, unrighteousness, and
lieng. This verse must be read in a Parenthesis, that the words which follow,
may agree with the sentence going before.

Verses. 10. 11.
10 Approving that which is pleasing to the Lord.

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but even
reprove them rather.

Allowing that whereby the Lord is well pleased, and have nothing to do (or
meddle not) with unfruitful (or unprofitable) works, but rather rebuke them.
THe Apostle declares, what it is ( To walk as children of light,) and he
draws the endeavors or studies of the children of light, as it were to three
heads. For his will is first, that we should search out and approve whatsoever
is acceptable unto God: that is to say, whatsoever is commanded and set down
in his word. For, as the word of God alone instructs and teaches us, what
pleases him, and what displeases him: so this word alone ought to be the rule
of life unto the godly.

Secondly, the Apostle requires us ( Not to have any fellowship with the
unfruitful) that is to say, unprofitable and hurtful ( works of darkness:)
to wit, which proceed from the ignorance of the Gospel, and of Christ, and
which have in them as their cause, concupiscence ingendered: such are the
heathenish and horrible sins, wherewith they that are ignorant of the
Gospel, defile and stain themselves* Now, we are said then to have fellowship
with heinous and great disordered sins, both when we either make proof any
manner of way, one or other, that they please us, or when we ouerslip them
with silence, and that most of all, if our calling otherwise seem to charge
us, that we ought openly to profess our selves displeased with them.

Thirdly, that we should rebuke the works of darkness, and that as well by
our holy and honest life, as also by lively voice, springing from a certain
zeal of the glory of God: and thus must we chiefly do, if it stand with the
order of our vocation and calling. But, if we may not do it in words: yet
notwithstanding, we must show one way or other, that these sins and
offenses like us not in any case, but altogether irke and loath us.

This place is to be marked. For the Apostle does not comprise in a short
Aphorism, the duties of the children of light: to wit, of Christians only:
but also disproueth and throws under foot the vanity of them, that give a
guess, (as the blind man shootes his bolt,) that they do their duties to the
uttermost, if they sin not themselves in their own person, being never a
whit careful for others. Moreover, the Apostle teaches in this place, that
they also are out of the way, and twang upon a wrong string, who though they
live in blind Popery, think notwithstanding that it is enough to abhor
ungodliness, and defy papisticall superstition in mind and thought,
supposing that to be present at the abominable, Because that in being buisie
thereabouts, they pilfer and steal from God, part of his honor and service.
theeuish, and heathenish devotions of Papists, for outward peace and
quietness sake, is nothing hurtful. For they, which either by their presence
seem to allow these trumperies, although in mind they mislike them much: yet
notwithstanding, they put the halter of wicked fellowshippe about their own
necks.

And what do they? They understand not, that it makes no matter, whether they
do it of blind superstition, or of crafty and close dissimulation: seeing
that by either evil, as well this, (...) that, men make a mock of Gods holy
religion, and by their example, partly confirm and embolden the ignorance of
the blunter sort in more obstinate stubbornness: and partly infeeble and shake
the doubtful and wavering consciences of weaklings. 2. Reg. 5. 18.
As for Naaman the Governor of Syria, he makes very little or nothing on
their side, who at such time as he asked God forgiveness of one thing: to wit,
if he entered into the temple of Rimmon with his Lord and King, and worshipped
there: the Prophet let him go in peace. For that worshipping was not a falling
down before idols: but a certain stooping and bending forward of his body,
that the King might the more eastlie lean upon him, as he stayed and bare him
up. That this is so, the history it self plainly proves.

Verses. 12. 13. 14.
12 For it is shame, even to speak of the things which are done of them in
secret.

13 But all things, when they are reproved of the light, are manifest: for it
is light that makes all things manifest.

14 Wherefore he says, Awake thou that sleep, and stand up from the dead,
and Christ shall give thee light.

For it is filthy to tell what things are done privily of the^: but all
things, whiles they are rebuked of the light, are made manifest. For whatsoever
makes manifest, the same is light. Wherefore he says, Arise thou that
sleep, and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. THe
Apostle makes the sins and offenses of the heathenish Gentiles the more
grievous, and shows therewithal the fruit of rebuking and reproving:
whereby the godly, through their honest and holy life, may rebuke the
uncleanness and wickedness of the ungodly. For, by such kinds of rebuking,
wicked men come to the knowledge of themselves: and when they take a view of
the manners of the godly, they confess their own beastliness: and so at
length begin to be ashamed of the filthiness of their faults and vices.
This is the meaning of this part or parcel of doctrine.

But, because the words of the Apostle have need to be erpounded, we will say
somewhat, that the weight of his words may be marked. For first of all, when
he says, ( It is shame even to speak of the things which are done of them in
secret,) it is a making of the matter worse, by laieng two evil things
together. It is less to speak of offenses and faults, than to commit or do
them: now, if so be it is shame, even to speak or talk of such misdeeds as
they have done, truly then the doing of a filthy deed is most of all to be
defied and spet at. Anon after, when he says, ( All things, when they are
reproved of the light, are manifest,) he declares the fruit of brotherly
rebuking or chiding one another.

The sense or meaning of the words is this, as Saint Ambrose does expound them,
Then do wicked men and offenders appear, and are seen in their colors, when
they are taken up for their faults: because he which offends, so long as he
is not rebuked, he seems in his own eyes not to offend at all. Now they are
made manifest by the light, because the children of God, who are called, The
children of light, rebuke them by their life, their doctrine, and wholesome
admonishments. The proof of this speech follows, even from the nature of
light. (Light, says the Apostle, makes all things manifest.) For, as
darkness shadoweth and covers all things, and makes them secreat and
hidden: so the light brings that out into open sight, and bright noone tide,
which lay lurking and shroonke up in darkness.

To this also he adds another comparison drawn from authority of Scripture:
( Awake, says he, thou that sleep:) that is to say, thou that snortest in
thy sins, forsake thy sins, and ( Arise from the dead:) that is to say,
abstain from sins which bring death with them. ( And Christ shall give thee
light:) that is to say, thou shall feel consolation by the spirit of Christ.
For how much more we sly from the darkness of sins, so much more shall
Christ the sun of righteousness shine in our hearts. Saint Hierome denies
that this saying is any where to be found in the Scriptures. Some there be,
which think that the Apostle had an eye to that place of the Prophet, where it
is spoken thus, Surge, illuminare, etc. Arise, be bright: for thy light is
come, Esai. 60. 1
and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. Other some refer it unto an
other place, because it should not seem to be unwarranted, where it is said
thus, Populus qui ambulat, etc. The people that walked in darkness have seen
a great light: Esai. 9. 2.
they that dwelled in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the
light shined.

Other some suppose that it is spoken (...), by way of imitation. For, all the
Prophets and sincere preachers of Gods word, whiles they do their endeavor to
call men back from sin, do use these or such like words in effect. For,
first of all, they exhort men (as indeed it is meet) to repentance and
amendment. Secondly, they join thereunto the word of promise, and
consolation also, whereby the repentaunt are raised up and comforted. To
conclude therefore, let us all learn, that the spirit of Christ speaks unto
every one of us, and says: ( Surge qui dormis, etc. Awake thou that sleep,
and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.)

Verses. 15. 16. and 17.
15 Take heed therefore that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as
wise,

16 Redeeming the time, for the days are evil.

17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but vnderstaud what the will of the Lord is.

See therefore that ye walk warily, not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the
time, because the days are evil. Wherefore, be ye not unwise, but understand
what the Lords will is. THat which the Apostle spoke metaphoricallie before,
under the names of light and darkness, now he expresses in proper and
familiar speech. ( Take heed therefore, says he, that ye walk
circumspectly, not as fools:) that is to say, ignorant of Christ and of the
Gospel: ( But as wise:) that is to say, taught the truth of God, and knowing
the will of God. He adds a reason of his exhortation drawn from the
circumstance of the time: ( Redeeming the time, says he, sor the days are
evil.) Now, what ( Redeeming the time) does mean, we shall soon understand
by laieng the contraries together. To let the time pass, by having some vain
matter in hand: and, To redeem the time, are contraries. As that therefore, is
the trick of a negligent and loose fellow: so is this the point of a thriftie
and wise man, who does not only, not abuse time, but also redeemeth the same,
with a thousand honest recreations.

The Metaphore is borrowed of merchants or occupiers, who are very buisie
about their mart, and make more account of some small gain, than they do of
all fond delights* and then chiefelie, when the times be troublesome, and the
days dangerous: as when hunger, or scarsitie increases, or when they have to
deal with crafty yonkers, or when their ware is dead, and seems to lie upon
their hands at hap hazard, or otherwise to hang upon doubtful fortune. For
then merchants and occupiers buisilie bestirre them, and do all things
circumspectly, watching (I warrant you) for opportunity in their affairs.

Seeing therefore we are said to redeem the time, when we provide against the
loss of such things as we love in this world: let us (for shame) take the true
opportunity, and fit time of salvation, offered unto us by the Gospel. For
that shall be the price of our redemption, if we renounce all entisements and
impediments, which may withdraw and keep us back from the kingdom of
Christ: and by all manner of means wait and watch with broad waking eyes for
the occasion, or due time of repairing our salvation. And why? Even because the
days are evil.

He says that ( The days are evil,) not in respect of the spaces of hours,
and course of the sun: but in consideration of the corrupt manners of the
world. For the figure Metony^^a is here understood, whereby time is taken for
the thing done in time. By these words he brings in that which he set down
before in other words, and says: ( Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understand
what the will of the Lord is:) as if the Apostle should say, For So Much as so
great dangers do incompasse the godly round about on all sides, it is
behouefull, that ye take diligent heed of the maliciousness, and corrupt
manners of the world, least ye suffer your selves through foolishness to be
withdrawn from the right way: but ye must rather regard this, that the will
of God be always before your eyes, and in your mind, which ought to be the
continual rule of your race, throughout your whole life, and in all your
doings. The Apostle declares by an Antithesis, or opposition, whom he
calls ( Unwise.) For he sets flat against them, ( Such as understand
what the will of God is.) They therefore, by proof of this place, shall be (
Unwise,) which live carelesselie, little thinking upon framing and ordering
their life according to the will of God.

Furthermore, this place of Saint Paul is worthy to be always in our sight.
For it gives us warning, that we should not suffer our selves to be thrown
headlong into all sorts of sins, after the example of the multitude: from
which sins, we must altogether and utterly abstain, if we will be godly
indeed: and we must endeavor our selves to do the will of God, albeit we
renounce and forsake every thing that pleases the flesh. Here let each one
of us eramine and prove himself, taking heed therewithal, that we cast not
at our tails too sawcilie and scornfullie, this wholesome exhortation of the
holy Ghost, making much of the alluring pleasures of the flesh, and other
things, which are of force to turn our hearts from the desire of true
godliness.

Verses. 18. 19. and 20.
18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be fulfilled with
the spirit,

19. Speaking unto your selves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts,

20 Giving thanks alvvaies for all things unto God, even the Father, in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

And be ye not dronken with wine, wherein is lewdness (or wantonness) but be
ye rather filled with the spirit, speaking unto your selves in psalms, and
hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the
Lord, giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ. THe Apostle (for example sake,) ioineth unto his general exhortation,
certain specialties: and he commends unto us in the first place spiritual
reioicing, persuading us from fleshly reioicing or carnal gladness. For, as
spiritual reioicing as a certain spiritual wisdom: so fleshly or carnal
reioicing, which is drunkenness, is a kind of foolishness. As therefore he
gives us counsel to leave this: so his aduse is, to take the other: the
argument, which he uses in this case, is drawn from the effect of either of
both, and that by (...), demonstration. For, there is a reason framed orderly
against either of both, as in many like things before has been done. ( Be not
drunk with wine) says the Apostle: that is to say, Take not occasion by over
drinking your selves, to be merry and rejoice. Why so? Because therein
consists sottishness: that is to say, all kind of wantonness, lewdness,
filthiness, and intemperance. For, drunkenness causes a man to run
headlong into all manner of misdemeanour, and to commit much mischief,
according to these verses, not so old as true: Quid non ebrietas, etc.

What does not drunkenness deal with all?
To blab our secrets comes from thence:
It biddes be bold: and grieved at gall,
Inforceth fight where is no fence.
Cicero in his second book De finibus, declares who they be, that are called
sots, his words are these: Noli mihi, etc. Tell not me, as ye are wont, of such
sots as spue at the table, and are feign to be carried away from bankets, and
having surfetted, go again afterward, and cramme themselves full like
Capons. This therefore does not only offend God most greeuouslie, and put out
the light of the holy spirit in our heart: but also estrangeth and
bestraughteth the mind, discloseth secrets, kindles lust, weakeneth the body,
breeds very many diseases of mind and body: of which thing the whole
world almost is a witness.

Against this the Apostle sets ( The fullness of the spirit,) that is to
say, joy in the holy spirit, whereby we burst out into godly speeches,
concerning God and heavenly things, into ( Psalms, hymns, spiritual songs,
and thanksgiuings,) unto almighty God our bountiful Father, who gives all
things abundantly to his children, for his sons sake Jesus Christ our Lord.
For, therefore he ioineth ( God) and ( Father) together in this place, not that
they are two, but one God: whose great power doubtless, is signified by the
name of ( God:) and his good will noted, under the true name of ( Father.)

Moreover, the difference between ( Psalms, hymns, and songs,) is this. They
are ( Psalms,) in singing whereof Musicians use some manner of instrument,
besides the tongue (Hymns) consist in praises, sounded either with the tongue
alone, or some other way. ( Songs) are uttered with the voice, and belong not
only to praises* but also to other things, as prophesies, doctrines,
erhortations, etc. Now, Saint Paul's meaning is, to have all theie (Spiri^uall)
that is to say, not idle, foolish, and wanton: but tending wholly to
edification. For this word ( Spiritual,) put to, ought to be referred unto the
argument and end. As for the words of S. Paul which follow, they are not at
squa^e with these things, ( Speaking unto your selves:) again, ( Singing and
making melody in your hearts:) For the phrase of Scripture, ( Speaking to your
selves,) is as much as, between or among your selves: and ( Singing in your
hearts,) as much as, from your hearts. The Apostle cannot away with wanton
songs, and vain pipings, twangings, whistlings, and such like, wherewith the
conscience is never a whit edified: but the conscience by them is rather
troubled, godly prayers hindered, devotions slackened, and the heat of
serving God quenched. The songs which he requires are such only, as
proceeding from a pure and clean heart, bring spiritual gladness and
reioising to godly Christians.

This place of the Apostle therefore does teach, in what things the reioisings
of the godly do consist: to wit, in speaking one to an other of God, and
heavenly matters, and in godly songs, whereby our hearts are stirred up to
greater faith and confidence.

Furthermore, although drunkenness is to be defied, and fled from, as a most
noisome plague or pestilence: yet notwithstanding, honest and sober meetings of
Christians, to make merry and banquet together, are not to be condemned. For,
these may be certain prouokements of godliness, and also of mutual love:
and therefore the godly shall not utterly forswear and forsake such kinds
of feasting: provided always, that intemperaunce and drunkenness be kept out
a door. But of this matter look further in my A book so entitled.
Pastor.

Verse. 21.
21 Submitting your selves one to an other in the fear of God. Submit your
selves one to an other in the fear of Christ. Hitherto the Apostle has
reasoned of common duties of Christians: taking in hand now to commend unto the
Ephesians the sundry duties of several persons, he sets down first of all
a general rule or precept concerning submission one to an other: and thereupon
afterward brings in certain degrees and particularities touching the same
matter. Moreover, in this generality two things are diligently to be marked:
to wit, the precept, and the rule, or tho reason of the rule. The precept is
this, ( Submitting your selves one to an other.) This precept pertains to all
men, of all states and degrees whatsoever. For, there is none, but ought of
duty to do good unto others, and to serve them in love and charity So kings
and princes serve their subjects. For, wheresoever truth possesses the mind,
there is also present a ready will to show all kind of service, and obeisance.

The rule of submission one to an other, is ( The fear of Christ.) This (
Fear) is nothing else, but the service of faith and submission. This ( Fear)
takes away quite all arrogancy, whereby men, as it were ouerlooking one an
other from aloft, despise each other. This ( Fear) brings to pass, that we
denieng our selves, forsake all things, which Christ cannot abide to be in his.
To be short, this ( Fear) works in us, that we, after Christ's example,
serve all men, that by our obedience God might be glorified, and that we might
be knit one to an other in all duties of love and charity. This rule of
submission therefore, ought to be laid up in store, even in the secretest place
of our hearts. For, whosoever does not follow this rule, in performing
Christian duties, he may traiterouslie usurp and take upon him, the name of
Christ, but as for the rule of the spirit of Christ, and the gracious
government hereof, he has malapertlie shaken it off.

Verses. 22. 23. and. 24.
22 Wives, submit your selves unto your husbands, as unto the Lord:

23 For the husband is the wives head, even as Christ is the head of the
Church, and the same is the savior of his body.

24 Therefore, as the Church is in subjection to Christ, even so let the vviues
be to their husbands in every thing.

VViues be ye subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord, because the
husband is the wives head, even as Christ is the head of the Church, and he is
the savior of the body. But as the Church is subject unto Christ, even so let
wives be to their own husbands, in all things. THE Apostle laid before us a
general doctrine of submission one to an other: now he takes examples from
domestical or household estate, and shows in order the mutual duties of
wives and husbands, of children and parents, of servants and Masters: and he
handles in the first place, the duties of wives toward their husbands. He
confirms his proposition by comparison, and shows the manner of subjection
or submission.

The proposition stands upon comparison, in this sort: Genesis 3. 16.
( Wives submit your selves unto your husbands, as unto the Lord.) This law of
obedience is laid upon the woman, because she suffered her self to be deceived
of the serpent. And although in the first state of man, the wife was made
subject to the husband: yet notwithstanding, that subjection differed from the
other, which was afterward laid upon the woman. For the first subjection was,
as it were free and not hard a whit: but the second subjection brought with it
a heavy yoke, which kept her under, and this was the punishment of her sin.
But this yoke is made pleasant, rather than grievous, to godly women, when
they look upon the Lords will, for whose sake they owe subjection to their
husbands.

The Apostle adds a reason to his proposition, which reason rises from the
ordinance of God, and from that which is profitable. ( Because the husband is
the wives head,) says Saint Paul: that is to say, not only the higher, as
the head in the body: but also, as the head gives power and ableness to the
body, whereby the health of the body is maintained: so the husband ought to
have a regard to the welfare of his wife. That this was the meaning of S.
Paul, by this word ( Head,) the comparison following does declare. ( As Christ
is the head of the Church, and the same is the savior of his body.) Now,
Christ is the ( Head) of the Church, both because he alone is chief governor
thereof, and also because that whatsosoeuer good thing the Church has, it
proceeds from Christ her ( Head:) as we have declared in the second Chapter.

Now follows the manner of subjection. ( Therefore as the Church is in
subjection to Christ, even so let the wives be to their husbands, in every
thing.) This ( Subjection) therefore ought to be free, voluntary, willing,
ready, cheerful, pleasant, dutiful, chaste, honest, godly, and so forth.
And although Christ and the husband, are not equal in authority: yet
notwithstanding, husbands have rule over their ( Wives), after the example of
Christ, and represent a certain image of the Lord Christ in his Church.

The first is, that wives which are disobedient and stubburne against their
husbands, are so far from being obedient unto Christ, that they entangle
and wind themselves in Satan's nets and snares.

The second is, that wives may receive great profit by godly obedience and
subjection: even as the body, which cleaves unto the head, borrows and
takes from thence all his liveliness and ability.

The third is, that wives must be content with their own husbands, whom they
must endeavor, to the uttermost of their might, to please, with all godly
duty, and honest service.

The fourth is, that the subjection of wives, is not only to be allowed, for
domestical or household profits sake: but also because it is a service
pleasing God, when it issues and comes from true faith and love.

The fifth is, that the error of the old heretics is here overthrown, who
esteemed and took marriage for a profane and unholy thing, and after a sort
unworthy for Christians. But the holy Ghost in this place is of a far
contrary mind, who compares honest marriage, to the coupling of Christ and
his Church. Here let us note well that saying in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
Heb. 13. 4.
a saying deserving due memory: Honorabile inter omnes, etc, Marriage is
honorable among all, and the bed undefiled: but whooremongers and adulterers,
God will judge.

Verse. 25.
25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ loved the Church, and gave
himself for it. Husbands love your wives, even as Christ loved the Church,
and gave himself for the same. THis is the second example or specialtie of the
generaltie already past, and contains three things: to wit, the precept,
the cause, or the reason, and the manner of love. The precept is, ( Husbands,
love your wives.) The cause or reason is, ( Even as Christ loved the Church.)
The manner is expressed by example, ( And gave himself for it.) Heerehence
does appear the greatness of Christ's love. If therefore husbands will rule
over their wives, after the example of Christ: let them then learn and know,
that they are warned by his example, to declare their love by their deeds, if
occasion so require: even as Christ did, whiles he sought and bought the life
and salvation of his Church, with his own death.

Verses. 26. and. 27.
26 That he might sanctify it, and cleanse it by the washing of water,
through the word:

27 That he might make it unto himself, a glorious Church, not having spot, or
wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy and without blame.

That he might make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water, in the
word, that he might make her unto himself a glorious Church, not having
blemish or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that she should be holy and
blameless. THE Apostle having taken occasion by the example of Christ, loving
his Church, and giving himself for it, makes a fit enteraunce into the
commendation of the grace of Christ toward his Church, according to the order
of such benefits, as Christ of his mere grace, bestowed upon his Church. For,
first of all, he loved the Church. Secondly, for that loves sake he gave
himself for her. Thirdly, he sanctified his Church: that is to say, he
seuereth and takes her apart to himself, and makes her holy unto God,
through the forgiveness of finnes, and the spirit of regeneration, or new
birth. Fourthlie, the Apostle adds the manner how Christ sanctified his
Church, saying: ( Cleansing it by the washing of water through the word.)
Fiftlie, the end of the sanctification of the Church is set down: to wit, That
the Church might be fair and beautiful, without spot or wrinkle, decked and
garnished with holiness and vnblameablenesse.

But the fourth and the fifth degree, do need a larger exposition. For, they
contain diverse and manifold doctrines. When the Apostle therefore says, (
Cleansing it by the washing of water through the word,) he most lively sets
forth the force of the sacrament of Baptism. For, if we shall as it were
unfold and lay open these words, we shall see five things in Baptism meet
and worthy of marking. The first is, Christ cleansing us. 1. Ioh. 3. 8
For, to Christ alone this honor does agree and belong, Who appeared to this
end, that he might destroy the works of the devil, and take away sin.
Heereto serves the saying of S. John: Sanguis Jesus, etc. The blood of Jesus
Christ the son of God, Heb. 9. 14.
cleanses us from all sin. 1. Pet. 1. 18 19.
The second is, ( The washing of water,) which is the outward sign of grace,
1. Ioh. 1. 7.
and the seal of our inward cleansing. Revel. 1. 5.
The third is, the truth answering unto the sign, which is to be considered:
this is a secret cleansing of our souls, and an inward washing away of our
sins. The fourth is, ( The word) that the force and virtue of Baptism may
be understood by the word of promise. The fifth is, the analogy or proportion
of the sign to the truth: which analogy or proportion is diligently to be
considered in every sacrament. The sign is, The washing of water: the
analogy or proportion is, As water cleanses the body without: so the blood
of Christ washes away the filth of sin from the soul within. This analogy
or proportion the Apostle signifies unto us, under this word ( Cleansing.)

These things thoroughly considered, and rightly weighed: it is easy to
know, in what account the sacraments of the Church ought to be. For, they are
signs, seals, and tokens, whereby God offers his grace: and gives
evidence, that he will indeed perform that, which the outward things
themselves do represent. For, the truth of the thing unseen, is always joined
with the sacraments seen: and so is the giving it self, which is thoroughly
done by the secret working of the holy ghost. Not that the holy Ghost
stands in need of any outward help, but there is consideration had of our
weakness.

Out of these things it is easy to gather, that a sacrament is rightly
defined in the new Testament, to be a sign seen and fealt, ordained even of
Christ himself, to seal the word of grace and promise, which is to be
received by faith. And although the wicked are neither washed with Baptism,
nor nourished by the Lords supper: yet notwithstanding, the sacraments keep
their force and virtue, in respect of God: because howsoever the unthankful
will none of it, Gods grace is offered unto them nevertheless.

Furthermore, the description of the Church, which follows, does not belong
to outward show and fashion, but to the inward cleanness of the heart. This
is rightly to be understood, because of them which deny that there is a
Church, where any such are assembled, as bear about with them, any manner of
spot, blemish, or stain whatsoever. To the boulstering up of which error of
theirs, they wrest this place of Saint Paul: If (say they) the Church have no
spot, and no wrinkle: if the Church be holy and without blame: Ephesians. 5. 26.
27.
then shall not this assembly, where so many misliuers are met together be
the Church.

This error is disprooued, by the order of praieng, which the Lord left us for
a pattern. For we are bidden to pray thus, Mat. 6. 12.
Remitte nobis debita, etc. Forgive us our trespasses. And in the Psalm it is
said, Pro iniquitate, etc. Psalm. 32. 5. 6.
For the remission of sins, every holy and godly one shall pray unto
thee. If therefore all the holy ones, (commonly called Saints,) have need to
pray daily for the remission of sins, they shall not then be altogether
free from every spotte. And Saint John says, 1. John. 1. 8. 9.
Si dixerimus, etc. If that we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves,
and truth is not in us. If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just,
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

The Apostle does not therefore mean, that the Church is already cleansed,
and void of all blemishes or freckles: but rather, that she grows up daily,
and continually profits, directing her course wholly thither, whither she
will never be able to come, whiles this world lasts. For, so long as the
Church abides in this world, she is stained and spotted two ways. For, first
of all, there is no member of hers so pure and perfect, but is attainted with
diverse sins and vices. All the faithful therefore, Romans 7. 16. 17. 18. 19
20. 21. 22. etc.
for the time of their tarrieng here, have always some uncleanness, which
remains in their flesh, as plainly is proved, by the experience of the
Saints, or holy ones.

Furthermore, Hypocrites and foul offenders, who with their filthiness infect
the whole Congregation, are always mingled with the good and godly in the
Church: as Saint Paul manifestly teaches, writing to the Corinthians. For,
he adorneth and beautifieth the Corinthians, with the title of the Church:
howbeit, there were among them many high-minded, many defiled with things
offered up unto idols, some that had ill names for committing incest: very
many used the Lords holy supper irreverently, not a few which called the
rising again of the dead in doubt: as evidently appears in the Epistles.
The Lord also himself overthrows this, by the parable of the darnell.

Whereto then serves that stately and lofty speech of the Apostle, calling
the Church of Christ his spouse, ( Not having spotte or wrinkle, holy, and
without blame?) I answer: the Church is to be considered after two sorts: to
wit, in her self, and in Christ. As the Church is considered in her self, she
has many spots doubtless, wherewith she is blemished: which
notwithstanding are not imputed and laid to her charge, whiles the spirit has
the upper hand in her. But as she is considered in Christ, she is not only
without spotte, but also exceeding gorgeously garnished: to wit, with the
righteousness of Christ, which she has obtained by free gift. Saint
Augustine makes a difference between the state of the Church in this life,
and in the life to come. In this life present, the Church has her spots. In
the life to come she shall be without all spot, pure, holy, and without blame
in very deed.

This place of the Apostle teaches, comfort, and disprooueth. It teaches,
to what end we are washed with holy Baptism: namely, that we should
endeavor our selves to be pure and clean. It comfort them which groan
under the burden of their sins, and lament that they are ouerladen with them.
For the time will come, when their full cleansing shall be. To this pertains
the complaint of the Apostle, and his comfort by and by following: Romans 7. 24.
25.
Infoelix homo, quis me eripiet ex hoc corpore morits, etc. O wretched man that
I am: who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through
Jesus Christ our Lord.

It disproueth them, which brag and boast of Baptism, and in the mean time
lead an unclean life, flatly withstanding the analogy or proportion of
Baptism, which puts us in mind of continual repentance.

Here may that be alleged, which Siant Paul alleged against the Jews of
his time, Circumcisio quidem prodest, Romans 2. 25
etc. Circumcision verelie is profitable, if thou do the Law: but if thou be
a transgressour of the Law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. Even
after the same manner we may proceed against them, which are Christians
only in name: saying, Baptismus quidem prodest, etc. Baptism verelie is
profitable, if thou do the law of Baptism, that is to say, if thou keep the
covenant of Baptism: but if thou be a transgressour thereof, thy Baptism does
thee no good.

Verse. 28.
28 So ought men to love their vviues, as their own bodies. So ought men to
love their wives even as their own bodies. THe Apostle yet more manifestly
declares and shows the manner of loving our wives: having an eye to the
first couple that ever were married, even Adam and Eve. When Adams wife was
brought unto him, he said: Hoc nunc os de ossibus meis, and caro de carne mea:
This now is bone of my bones, Genesis 2. 23.
and flesh of my flesh. And therefore of Adams ribbe, the Lord made the woman:
that thereby he might represent his Church: and also show, of what mind
husbands and wives ought to be, either to other in holy matrimony. For, the
husband and the wife are (as it were) one and the self same flesh: that is to
say, one and the self same body. Upon this ground Saint Paul builds this
reason: ( No man ever yet hated his own flesh:) but the wife is one flesh, or
one body, with her husband: Ergo, husbands ought to love their own wives, as
their own flesh and bodies.

Verses. 28. 29. 30. 31.
28 He that loves his wife, loves himself.

29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes
it, even as the Lord does the Church.

30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

31 For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his
wife, and they tvvaine shall be one flesh.

He that loves his wife, loves himself. For no man ever yet has hated his
own flesh, but nourished and cherished the same, even as the Lord does the
church, because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
For this things sake, shall a man forsake father and mother, and shall stick
by his wife, and these two shall be one flesh. THe Apostle defends and
proves that we must love our wives, and sets down in the first place, two
ariomes, principles, or grounds, which are the propositions of two syllogismes.
Afterward he adds other two arguments: the first whereof is fetched from the
example of Christ, the second from the ordinance of God. These latter arguments
are added, to confirm the former. The first syllogism is this, being made
upon the first principle: ( He that loves his wife, loves his own self:)
But every husband loves his own self: Ergo, he ought to love his wife. The
second syllogism rises out of the second principle, in this wise: ( No man
ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherrisheth it:) but the wife
is the flesh of her own husband: Ergo, the husband ought not to hate his wife,
but rather to nourish and cherrish her. To this he ioineth an argument drawn
from example: ( Because she is flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones.) This
he proves and defends by authority out of Genesis, saying: ( For this cause
shall a man leave his father and his mother, Genesis 2. 24
and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh. As if he
should say. A man were better forsake his father and his mother, though he be
bound unto them by the laws of nature: than to leave his wife, with whom he is
one flesh, so long as the substance of matrimony remains safe and sound.
For if adultery creep in between, the guilty party is cut off from that
unity or oneness of the flesh, which the Lord requires in honest matrimony.
Now, the husband and the wife are said to be ( One flesh,) not in substance,
but in affection and love. For, the husband shall love his wife and cherrish
her, even as his own flesh: the wife in like case shall love her husband as
her own flesh. The husband and the wife therefore are one, out of which union
or oneness, Matthew. 19. 3. 4. 5. 6. etc.
Christ makes his answer to the question concerning diuorcements.

Verses. 32.
32 This is a great secreat, but I speak concerning Christ, and concerning the
Church. This mystery is great, but I talk as touching Christ, and the Church.
THis is an admonition or advertisement. For, the Apostle could not
sufficiently utter in words, what a wonderful lively image of the coupling
of Christ and the Church, marriage, is which God ordained in Paradise. And
although marriage be an outward thing: yet notwithstanding, the Apostle
avouches, that it was a certain figure of Christ the Bridegroom, and of the
Church the Bride. For, as the woman was taken out of the side of the man, as he
lay a sleep: even so the Church grows up by the power and virtue of Christ's
death. And as she forsaking father and mother, cleaves unto her own husband,
and holds her self content with him alone, like an honest wife: even so the
Church forsaking idolatrous fornication, shall cleave unto her only
Bridegroom Christ Jesus, and shall rather leave her most sweet and tender
parents, than depart from Christ her husband.

Furthermore, as Eve was created and made out of Adams side: that is to say,
out of the midst of his body: even so the Church springs out of the flesh
and bones of Christ, which indeed has a secret signification, and is
mystically meant. For, there is a certain The latin copy has Anagogia,
which cannot stand with the sense of this place, as the learned do know.
(...), or proportion, of the thing seen, to that which is spiritual, and not
seen: whereupon S. Paul calls it, ( A mystery or secret:) that is to say,
a sacrament. For marriage leads us after a sort, by the thing seen, to a
thinking upon the inward coupling together of Christ and the Church, which
marriage first represented. And this is Saint Paul's meaning, when he says: (
But I speak concerning Christ, and concerning the Church:) as if he should
say, The marriage of the man and the woman, was ordained of God in Paradise,
not only for the helping one of another, and for the begetting of children:
but also, that the same should be a certain sign of the coupling together of
Christ and the Church: so that under things seen, a spiritual matter is
represented as it were by lively image. Wherefore ye definition of ( Mysterium,
a Mystery or secret,) in great use among the Greeks, may fitly be applied
hereunto. For the Greek divines do make this definition of ( Mysterium, a
Mystery) That it is a visible action or deed doing, having joined unto it a
certain spiritual contemplation or meaning. And although this definition does
generally agree to the Sacraments of the Church of Christ: yet
notwithstanding, the reason is far otherwise of Sacraments, so called (...),
for their excellency. For, they were only ordained and appointed of Christ,
to be certain ceremonies and tokens of the invisible grace, which the Gospel
offers: of which sort there are only two in the new testament: namely,
Baptism, and the Lords supper.

Moreover, as the Papists have wickedlie wrested this place, to prove, that
matrimony is to be reckoned in the number of the sacraments of the new
Testament: so they truu to a weak foundation, which think that the Papists
are sufficiently disproued hereby: because (forsooth) the Greeks write it a
mystery, and not a sacrament: when indeed these two words do as much differ in
general signification, as ((...)) and ( Candidum,) both which words do
signify ( White.) For, that which the Greek Divines have called ((...)) the
Latins call ( Sacramentum:) which is all one. Wherefore, as our ancestors
thought, that matrimony was rightly called of Paul, a mystery, or
sacrament: so it is not to be doubted, but they harp upon a wrong string,
which reckon matrimony for a sacrament of the new Testament. Because it is
neither a proper ceremony of the new Testament, neither does it assure
sufficiently of it self, the promise of the grace of the Gospel, neither is
it a token or badge belonging to the Church alone: but it is a state and degree
of life common to all mankind.

Verse. 33.
33 Therefore, every one of you, do ye so: let every one love his wife,
even as himself: and let the wife see that she fear her husband. Let every
one of you therefore love his wife as his own self, and let the wife fear
her husband. LEast any should think, that holy matrimony is but a bare
badge or sign only: and that therefore, the words which have been already
spoken, concerning the comparison of Christ with the Church, to be referred to
the marriage of our first parents alone: the Apostle outreaching them that thus
might suppose, applies the example unto all generally: and shuts up in a
short sum, such things as he handeled, touching the duties of married
couples, one to another. And as he draws the duties of the husband toward
the wife, unto one head or spring of love: so he affirms, that the duty of
the wife is, to fear and reverence her husband, as her head.

Under this word ( Fear,) all duties of the wife, to the husband are
contained. The husband, which loves his wife unfeignedly, imbraceth,
tendereth, and makes as much of her, even from his heart root, as he does of
his own ribbe: that is to say, as S. Paul speaks here, as his own self:
that is, as his own flesh. For the Apostle painteth out before us this manner
of love: therefore he thinks well of it, he speaks honestly of it, his
advise and endeavor is not lacking to further it: finally, he bestows all
duties of courtesy, humanity, and gentleness upon it: yea, as he would do
to himself, so does he unto it, according to the law of God, and the
ordinance of nature.

The duty which shall answer on the other side unto this love, is contained
in this word ( Fear,) whereby the reverend service and dutifulness is
understood, with the which the wife being the inferior or lower, serves her
husband being the superior or higher, and shows unto him all duties of
subjection belonging unto him. She murmureth not against her husband, she
swells not at him, she sets not shoulder against him, she seeks not to be
head and ruler over the whole house: but performs all manner of duties and
services to her husband, with a godly love, honest affection, and Christian
tenderness.

This subjection, when it proceeds from faith and the fear of God, it is the
trimmest ornament, and the fairest furniture that an honest woman can have.
This place therefore teaches us, that That is, the regiment of the people,
when all rule lies in their hands, not allowing any governor, but
themselves.
Democracie, or seeking to be all alike in rule, is in a manner against nature.
For the rule of the husband over the wife, in the house, does show the form
and order of Aristocracie, or the very best and vprightest kind of government
that is. For, it cannot be, that there should be continuance of peace, and
maintenance of concord, wheresoever this (...), that is to say, equal swaie,
and rule all alike is received, which brings to pass, that every man is for
himself, all to command, and none to obeie.

THE SIXTH CHAPTER.
THE SVMME OF THE SIXTH Chapter.
CHildren and parents, servant and masters, must discharge such duties one
to an other, as belong to their calling. All must arm themselves with the
furniture and weapons of the spirit, to withstand the kingdom of Satan. Pray
ye for all men, and for me, whose state that you may know, I send Tychicus
unto you.

THE ORDER AND PARTS OF the sixth Chapter.
AS he treated of the duties of married folks, one to an other, in the end of
the fifth Chapter: so he sets down the duties of children and parents, of
servant and masters, in the beginning of this sixth Chapter. Afterward, the
Apostle comes back to a general exhortation, aduising the Ephesians to
furnish themselves with spiritual armor, against spiritual enemies, of whom
he makes a short description, and lays out the spiritual armor, piece by
piece, as it is to be put on. Moreover, the Apostle desires them to pray for
him, and certifieth them, that he sent Tychicus unto them, to comfort them.
Lastly, he shuts up his Epistle, after his woonted manner, with blessing
and welwishing unto them.

THE EXPOSITION OF THE SIXTH Chapter, with the observations of the doctrines
therein contained.
Verse. 1.
1 Children, obeie your parents in the Lord. Children obeie your parents in the
Lord. THis is the third specialtie: to wit, obedience of children toward
their parents, wherein we meet with two things to be marked. The first is, that
under this word ( Obedience,) the holy scripture compriseth honor, whereof
obedience is a most assured token: by the figure Synecdoche, commonly in use.
This honor hangs upon two points: namely, in affection, and in effect. The
honor which stands upon affection, is true godliness toward our parents,
true love, and fervent good will likewise, wherewith we make much of them, and
dutifullie behave our selves toward them, because they are our parents.

The effect of honor due to our parents is, to be fully persuaded in mind
and conscience, that their estate is in deed a divine order and degree
appointed by God: and for that cause to be had in estimation and account. Let
children therefore, even willingly, stand in awe of their parents, submit
themselves unto them, obeie them in all things that are honest and lawful, let
them show themselves thankful, gentle, doing them good in word and in deed,
covering the faults of their elders with meekness, or at least wise making
the best of that which is amiss.

The second thing, which I said was to be marked in this place, is: that this
obedience ought to be performed, ( In Domino, In the Lord:) which puts
children in mind of two very great things. The first is, To obeie for the
Lords sake, or for his commandments sake, and that faithfully, or in faith.
Heereto serves that saying of Jesus the son of Syrach, Qui timet, etc. He
that fears God, honors his parents. The second is, To know that a measure
of obedience is appointed them: least they should obeie their parents in things
which withstand the Lords will. For, if parents shall take in hand any such
thing, let children learn and know, that the law of their parents after the
flesh, laid upon them in that sort, is quite displaced by the commandment of a
higher governor, even their heavenly Father.

If parents therefore inioine and charge their children to do any thing,
either against religion, or against honesty, or to the hurt of their common
country: the children owe no obedience at all unto their parents in this case:
yea rather, let them set themselves flatly face to face and fist to fist
against them, provided always, that they pass not beyond the bounds of
godliness. To this belongs that notable saying of Ausonius: Parentibus, etc.
Then does a child obeie his father and his mother, when he or she does that of
their own will and accord, which they are rightly and well commanded to do.
With this also agrees that saying of our Lord, Mat. 10. 37.
Si quis vult, etc. If any will come to me, and hates not his father and his
mother, he cannot be my disciple. Luke 14. 26
Our parents therefore are to be loved, but yet our Creator is to be preferred.
Heerevpon S. Ambrose says: Si officium, etc. If duty is not to be denied, but
to be discharged toward our parents: how much more then to the maker, causer,
and procurer of our parents: namely, God, whom thou art bound to praise and
thank for thy parents? And the same S. Ambrose says: Vt pas^endos, etc. As
the Scripture commands us to feed and cherish our parents: so it bids us
give them over and forsake them, if they shall be hinderers of a desire and
disposition to holiness and devotion.

The hate therefore which Christ teaches us to bear toward our parents, is
but a dissembled hate, or a hate in show: whereby we seeming deaf and hard of
hearing, regard not, but lightly pass by the sweet sugared songs of Sirens:
that is to say, of our parents, doing what they can, with the balmed baits
of this world to undo us, and to drown us in the waves of wickedness: but we
ought not to give them the hearing, much less the doing. This hate therefore
is the hate of dissimulation, not of persecution: of avoiding, not of annoieng:
of eschewing, not of undoing: of godliness, not of cruelnesse. For, then ought
we, as it were to hate them, to pass by them, to keep us from them, when we
cannot serve God and them both at once. But surely, if both could
conveniently be done, then doubtless God first of all must have his honor,
and secondly our parents their duty and service.

Verses. 1. 2. and. 3.
1 For this is right.

2 Honor thy father and mother, (which is the first commandment with
promise:)

3 That it may be well with thee, and that thou may live long on earth.

For this is right. Honor thy father and thy mother (which is the first
commandment in promise:) that it may go well with thee, and that thou may
live long upon earth. THis is a reason of the exhortation set down before: and
it stands upon three points: namely, upon that which is honest, upon the
cause commanding, and upon that which is profitable. It is honest and right to
give thanks for good turns: to our parents specially, which begot and brought
us up. The cause commanding, is the law of God, which charge children to
honor their parents. It is profitable so to do. Why? Because of the happy
success, good luck, and long life, which follows thereupon.

But here certain questions are to be canuassed and sifted out, the first
whereof is this: Does it not oftentimes fall out, that godly and virtuous
children die before their time, and too too soon? How then shall this promise
of long life upon earth be sure, steddie, and undoubted, to trust unto? Do not
ungodly and ungracious children live a long time, and see many days? I
answer.

This must first of all be considered, that what earthly benefit, or
temporal gift so ever, our most loving and heavenly Father does promise us,
the same is to be received upon this condition: to wit, so far forth as it
turns us to good, and serves for the salvation of our soul. Wherefore it
comes to pass, and that not seldom, that how much more God loves his
child, so much the sooner he takes him out of this life: according to that
saying, Ablatus est iustus, etc. The just and righteous man is taken away
before his time, least wickedness should change his disposition, and
maliciousness mar his manners.

Now, because it happens sometimes, that wicked and ungracious children live
long: the cause thereof is the long suffering and gentleness of God, calling
them to repentance, which if they set at naught, they lay up for themselves,
treasure against the day of wrath, that they may even then be tormented with
everlasting pains for their stifnecked stubbornenesse.

Why does the Apostle call this commandment, ( The first with promise,)
being in deed the fourth in place and order: seeing also the first
commandment has a promise joined with it, even the promise of Gods favor
and mercy? I answer: We must mark, that in the law of God, promise is of
two sorts: the one general, the other special or particular. That is a
general promise, which the first commandment has hanging upon it, which is
in deed a promise of a universal or whole obedience to the law of God: that
is to say, it does not properly belong to the first commandment, but unto
all the commandments, or to the universal and whole obedience of the law.
The special or particular promise is that, which particularly and severally
by it self is tied to some one commandment: as, long life is promised in the
fourth commandment, to be the reward of obedience toward our parents,

Furthermore, the demand touching the necessity of the end of every ones
life, appointed by destiny, is answered out of this place. For these words of
the Apostle do manifestly disprove and overthrow them, which say, that the
term of life cannot be shortened by sin and offense: nor yet prolonged by
duty and obedience. Which if it should be true, the holy Ghost would not in
any wise promise happy success, and long life unto them, which honor their
parents: and it were flat against all reason, if this obedience should do no
good at all, either for the prosperous falling out of things, or for the
lengthening of life.

Against this false imagination therefore of the Stoikes, which does not only
hurt and ravish manners, but alse quite puts out and destroieth all
exercises of godliness, most sure and steadfast testimonies must be provided,
and learned: of which testimonies there are three kinds specially, which
overthrow this necessity of the term or end of our life, which destiny has
made certain, undoubted, and immovable, as say the Stoikes. the Testimonies
are these, promises of obedience, threatenings for stubbornenesse, and examples
of both.

Testimonies of promises, because they are many, these few shall serve the
turn. It is thus said in Exodus and Deuteronomie, Honora patrem tuum, and
matrem tuam, Exodus 20. 12.
etc. Honor thy father, and thy mother, that thy days may be prolonged upon
the land, Deuteronomy. 5. 16
which the Lord gives thee. Prou. 9. 11
Again, in the Proverbs: Per me multiplicabuntur, etc. Prou. 10. 2. 27.
Thy days shall be multiplied by me, and the years of thy life shall be
augmented. Again, Iusticia liberabit, etc. Righteousness delivers from
death. And again, Timor Domini, etc. The fear of the Lord increases the
days.

Of these promises there are many examples. Deuteronomy. 9. 13 14.
When God threatened that he would destroy the stifnecked people, Moses
entreats for them, and according to promise, the penitent were spared. The
destruction and overthrow of the Ninevites was pronounced even by Gods own
mouth, Jonas. 3. 2. 4. 10.
to fall upon them the fourtith day after Jonas began to preach: but yet
according to promise, the penitent were spared. 2. Sam. 14. 17. 18. 21. 25.
David makes his prayer unto God, and reared up an altar, that the pestilence
might cease: and he obtained his asking. ^saie. 38. 3. 5.
As for Ezechias, what should I speak of him? His repentance got him fifteen
years longer life.

There are very many testimonies of threatenings for stubbornness,
stiffeneckednesse, and disobedience, such as these: Pro. 20. 20
Qui maledicit, etc. He that curses his father or his mother, his light shall
be put out in obscure places, or in the midst of darkness. Pro. 10. 27
Again, Anni impiorum, etc. The years of the wicked shall be diminished. Psa.
54. 23
Again in the Psalm, Viri sanguinum, etc. The bloody and deceiptfull men,
shall not live half their days. In the 20. Chapter of Leuiticus, the Lord
threateneth a rooting out of wicked offenders from among their people, which
rooting out, can be nothing else, but a shortening and cutting off of their
life, for the foul offenses which they committed.

Of these testimonies, there are many examples. Her the son of Judah, Genesis
38. 7. 9 10.
because he was wicked in the sight of the Lord, it is said that the Lord slew
him. Again, Onan spilling his seed upon the ground, least he should raise up
issue unto his brother, was also slain of the Lord. Joshua. 7. 1 25. 26.
Achan, for the spoil of the excommunicate thing, was commanded even by Gods
own mouth, to be stoned to death. These promises, and threatenings, with
their examples, do plainly enough disprove and overthrow the opinion of the
Stoikes, touching the end and ternie of life, guided by destiny.

With these reasons accords the saying of Job: Job. 7. 1.
which they wrest to the stablishing of their opinion. Job. 14. 5
For Job speaks under condition, whereupon it is manifest, nothing can be
proved. And although one or other stand in it stoutly, that by the words of
Job there is a certain end of life limited, set and appointed: let him or
them know, that the saying of Job, concerning the end of life limited, set,
and appointed, is not to be referred unto causes of destiny, but to the
obedience and disobedience of Gods commandment.

Hereunto also serves the demand touching the vanity of Natiuitie-casters,
and Fortune Tellers: that is to say, of them, which by birthstarres: that is,
by stars which arise at every ones coming into the world, tell folks
fortunes, their good luck, and their ill luck. And although it is to be
granted, that all earthly things, and Al things under the moon are so called
inferior bodies, have a kind of affinity or kindred (as it were) with the
course of the stars, and so come by their disposition and quality: yet
notwithstanding, the knowledge and certeintie of every man's disposition and
manners, their health and sickness, what shall chance unto them, and what
they shall do or suffer in their life: besides all that, when, where, and
after what sort they shall die: cannot be concluded thereupon.

These are in a manner, the things which our Chaldeans, Egyptians, or
Astrologers profess themselves skillful and cunning to tell, before they come
to pass. For, as we deny not unto that most noble Art, which they name
natural Astrology, the knowledge of Natures order, and the mouings of
heavenly bodies: even so we utterly mislike their superstition, who
professing indiciall Astrology, (for with this great and glorious title they
deck and garnish their superstition,) do measure and guess every man's
fortune by the hour of his birth. For, to speak of every man's manners, and
of their health or sickness, strength or weakness, dispositions and
complexions, I say and avouch it, that there can no certeintie be concluded
by the stars.

And although there be some consent and accord of the stars with these
inferior bodies, whereby the properties and estates, which peculiarly belong
to bodies, are framed: and sometimes also perteine to affections in men, which
for the most part consist in complexions: yet notwithstanding, the
Natiuitie-casters, and Fortune Tellers, do far ouershoote the mark, when
they give judgment according to the time of birth. For, whiles they confess,
that recourse must be made from the time of bearing, to the time of begetting:
what do they else, but bewraie their own vanity? For, it is not possible,
that Natiuitie-casters and Fortune Tellers should hear and know for
certeintie, the very time of conception or begetting.

For, seeing that the time of birth, is not only oftentimes sooner than it
should be: but also (and that not seldom) put off and delaied the longer,
through the weakness of the woman with child, or which lies in labor: how is
it possible (I beseech you) to know the very instant of ones begetting?
Specially, if but in the missing of a very few minutes of an hour, there is
wont to be a very great inclination and moving of the heavens and the
stars? He therefore that will certeinlie, and undoubtedly tell before hand,
by the time of birth, what shall happen hereafter, he had need, taking his
Astralobe, and holding it in his hand, to stand by, even at the time of
begetting, when the very deed is a doing. For, it is no sure trusting of
Clockes or Dialls in so weighty a matter.

Furthermore, seeing many are borne at one and the self same instant of time,
and yet nothing like in nature and manners, what man being well in his wits,
will believe, that the manners of men depend upon the stars? Besides that,
the force of the seed, which breeds the child, is much greater than the
force of the stars, as touching the framing of manners. For we see many
express the nature and manners of their parents, of whose seed they were
begotten. As for the spiritual begetting, whereby the manners of the saints
are framed, it has no place here. For, that begetting depends not upon the
stars, but upon the will of God.

Now, touching bodily health, although I judge that in some part, the stars
have to deal therein: yet notwithstanding, I flatly deny, that it can be
certeinlie told of Natiuitie-casters, and Fortune Tellers: because of the
uncertainty of begetting. Upon the self same foundation are their flim flam
tales builded, which profess that they can tell (as right as a rams horn,)
what shall chance to every man in his life: and this (forsooth) they will
show you by the star, under which they were borne. For as the time of
begetting is uncertain, as has been already declared: so the causes of
chances in a man's life, proceed from some other means and place. The saying
of the Lord remains fast and sure, Honora parents, Exo. 20. 12
vt been tibi sit, Honor thy parents, that it may go well with thee. Deu. 5.
16.
This oracle is as certain, as what is most certain, which no decree of
Natiuitie-casters and Fortune Tellers: nor any birthstarre is able to change
or take away.

Touching their tittle tattle of the kind and time of death, it is a tale as
vain as the rest. For this is to be abidden by, that in one skirmish, and in
one hour threescore thousand men were slain, all which (out of doubt) had
diverse and sundry birthstars. It is as true also, that at one instant of time,
children have been borne, who notwithstanding died at several times.

Out of these I conclude, that their superstition is most vain, which will
have men's chances and fortunes, subject to their judicial Astrology. Let
them gainsaie what they can, these reasons may suffice to spy their
iugglings, and to avoid their wiles. The birthstarre of a man, it depends
either upon the time of his conception or begetting, or else upon the time of
his nativity or birth: but both are uncertain unto such, which holding in
their hand an Astralobe, stand not by them that are a begetting, and them that
are in childbearing. Again, if the issue of things commonly called ( Luck)
depend upon the stars, then shall the destiny of all such as have one and
the self same birthstarre, be alike: but every one that is well in his wits,
will say that this is stark false.

If good luck depend upon the stars, then shall obedience to Godward, depend
upon them too. For this is the proper cause of that. Furthermore, if the kind
of death, and all manner of misfortunes depend upon the stars, then shall
sins depend upon them too: which is horrible to be spoken. Seeing the case
stands so, I wish the wiser sort to be warned, that as it is meet to set
store by true and natural Astrology, which is very profitable in our life,
and a notable and excellent gift of God: so to take heed and avoid these
deceivers, these Jack iugglers, and common Couseners, which profess that they
can certeinlie tell, by birthstarres, what good luck, and what ill luck,
shall light upon a man, or a woman in this life: specially, seeing that
superstition is meruellous hurtful to good manners, flat against honest and
good laws, and as it were a disgracing of God: who witnesses, his own self,
that as a prosperous estate, and happy success of all things, are the rewards
of obedience: so misfortunes, and all kind of discommodities and mischiefs
are the punishments of sin.

As for that which some bring in, going about to make the best of these men's
madness: to wit, that the stars have not a sure, a steadfast, and an
undoubted working: Again, that stars do gently incline or draw to, and
not roughly compel: I say so too, so that this inclination or bending be
referred only to bodies, and complexions of bodies, by their leave: and not
unto the minds and wills of men, which have in them (...), that is, election
or choice: which is an ability, not bound, but at liberty, whereby the will
having great choice of things, takes this and that, according as it is lead:
as, to follow virtue, and avoid vice.

But this is little agreeable to the goodly and gaie promises of our
Chaldeans, Egyptians, or Astrologians, who will have their Art and cunning so
firm, fast, and immovable, as they dare boast, that nothing can be done, but
according to the rule and appointment thereof. For, an inclination is not a
necessary cause of any thing, specially in men, who may be governed by the
judgment of the mind, even contrary to inclination, if it be evil. And, to
hold my peace a while, there is nothing more foolish and unfit, than certeinlie
to conceive the effect and full accomplishment of a thing, upon a piece of a
cause, the same being of the basest order, and least force to bring forth an
effect and full accomplishment.

Now, in that the Mathematicians can foreshew the Eclipses, and change of
weather: this comes to pass, because they depend upon certain causes, which
causes, according to the ordinance of God, do ueuer alter or vary. And these:
to wit, change of weather depends upon the inclination of stars, which
inclination never deceives for the most part in things that lack life.
Wherefore as Eclipses stand upon demonstration: so change of weather stands
upon conjecture. It is far otherwise in the reasonable abilities of the mind,
specially in the wills of men, which are indifferenlie inclined unto
contraries, as has been already showed.

Verse. 4.
4 And ye, fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in
instruction, and information of the Lord. And ye, fathres, provoke not your
children to anger, but bring them up in learning, and the rebuking (or fear)
of the Lord. THis is the fourth specialtie, answerable to the former. For, as
that required of children their obedience: so this asks a duty of parents,
like in proportion and measure toward their children. And in the first place,
the Apostle sets down, of what things fathers ought to take heed:
secondly, what they ought to do with their children. He gives them warning,
to beware in any wise of too straight and sharp handling, seasoned with no
love or gentleness. For hard handling, wherein appears no fatherly love or
affection, has many inconveniences joined with it. For, first of all, it
makes their children dizzards, dolts, blocke-heads, heauie-hearted, and dull
of spirit. Secondly, it breeds hatred by little and little in their tender
minds, against their parents. Thirdly, this hatred, which they have
continued, makes place for stubbornness and rebellion: so that, when thou
would win them by gentleness and fair means, the mischief being so far
grown, thy labor is but lost. But where parents execute their rule and power
well over their children: there does authority hold them in fear, and
willingness to obeie* and kindness keeps them in love and readiness to
please. As therefore too much making, and as we say, cockering of our
children, is the next way to make them sluggards, and wantons: so a wise
bringing of them up, and a right and orderly using of them, makes them quick
spirited, honest, and thriftie. Now, the apostle adds, what parents ought to
do with their children, and that briefly, when he says: ( But bring them up
in instruction, and information of the Lord.) Saint Paul in this place
requires three things of godly parents. First, ( Bringing of them up,) which
thing parents are bound to do to their children, by the law of nature.
Secondly, ( Discipline or instruction,) whereby as their children may be
enured to the knowledge of godly and honest things, even so they may be made
mild gentle, and courteous: in so much that their wise conversation and honest
behauing of themselves, shall turn in the end to the comfort and honor of
their parents, and to the profit and commodity of the Commonwealth.

For, (...) in Greek, Instruction in Latin, is a certain ability of the
mind, whereby a man is made friendly to himself, and loving to others: which
thing doubtless cannot come to pass, without honest bringing up, and well
instructing of them in the knowledge of things profitable and necessary.
Heerevpon it is, that this (...) or Instruction, does signify sometimes, by
the figure Metonymia, the very instructing it self.

Again, because the stint of instruction is humanity, therefore does (...) or
instruction, signify other while, by the figure Prolepsis, humanity it self
also: that is to say, a meeknes, and courtesy in manners, and a tractablenesse
in a man's whole life. Thirdly, ( Information of the Lord.) The old
Interpreter has set down Or Chastisement: The Latin copy has Correptio,
which I cannot more aptly English.
Rebuking in steed of Information, which is not well done. For the Greek word
(...), betokens in general, such an information, whereby that is put into
ones mind, which is needful to be done.

The genitive case, Domini, (of the Lord,) is in place of an Adjective. For the
Apostles meaning is, that such things should be put into tender and young
minds, by daily admonishments, as tend to true godliness, and to the fear
of the Lord: besides this also, that they may be drawn to the learning of
such arts and sciences, as they seem to be most fit for by nature.

Nazianzenus writing to Eudoxus the Rhetorician, says, it was an ancient law
in Athens: yea, a very good law, which gave commandment, that so soon as
children came to years of discretion, they should be put out to learn arts
and sciences: which thing was done in this manner. There were brought and laid
in open place, instruments or tools belonging to every art and occupation:
now sir, the youth of that country being brought thither, chose every one for
himself, such tools as served that trade of life, wherein they most
delighted: heerevpon commandment was given by the magistrate, that they should
learn that science and occupation, which they had taken themselves unto,
nature having given plain proof thereof before. To this pertains that saying
of the Poet: Tui nihil, etc.

That thing thou shall not say, or do,
Which Nature noddeth not unto.
It is the parents charge therefore, diligently to mark and consider, for
what trades of life their children seem most fit. Let parents also themselves
learn first of all heerhence, that God requires earnestly at their hands, to
instruct their children, even with their own voice and information, in true
religion. And let none thus think with himself, that to indue tender and
young minds with doctrines or lessons of godliness, belongs to Churchmen,
and Schoolemaisters only: but also, that it is the duty of parents much more
to do this: who ought to sow the seeds of godliness in their childrens tender
minds, together with their milk.

Let children also learn, that it is their part, not only to obeie their
parents, training them up in godliness: but also to frame their manners and
behauiours diligently to the rule of godliness. They therefore that think
but so so of the studies and endeavors of godliness themselves, or cause
others by their means, to neglect and pass little for instructing their
children, even in their young years, with all diligence in Christian religion,
let them see to it, what answer they will make unto our Lord Jesus Christ, who
(by the holy mouth of Saint Paul) commends even to children the study and
learning of the holy Scriptures.

Verses. 5. 6. and. 7.
5 Servants, be obedient unto them that are your masters: according to the
flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your hearts, as unto Christ,

6 Not with service to the eye, as men pleasers: but as the servants of
Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,

7 With good will serving the Lord, and not men.

Servants obeie your masters, according to the flesh, with fear and
trembling, in simplicity of your heart, as unto Christ, not serving to the eye
as pleasing men, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the
heart, with good will, serving the Lord, and not men. AS the Apostle commended
before, unto children, and fathers of families, duties answerable to their
callings: so here he appoints servants their duties toward their masters,
according to the flesh. And although such kind of service, as was used in
Saint Paul's time among many, is seldom seen among us: yet notwithstanding,
this precept of Saint Paul, belongs to our men and maiden servants. But the
circumstances of this precept, are diligently to be considered.

For, first of all, he requires at servants hands, ( Obedience with fear:)
that is to say, an obedience joined with a careful reverence. Secondly, his
will is, that this obedience should proceed from ( Singleness of heart:) which
keeps frowardness and hidden hatred out of possession. For, S. Paul's
meaning is, that the heart should not disagree from outward obedience.
Thirdly, he sets down the cause, and the manner, when he says, ( As unto
Christ.) For, the Apostle in these words gives us this lesson, that servant
should have an eye, in every thing, which they are about, to the will and
commandment of God. As therefore servants owe obedience to their masters, for
Gods commandment sake: so they shall take heed, that they do nothing, for
their bodily masters pleasure, against the commandment of God. Fourthlie,
because servants are wont, for the most part, to serve to the eye, and not to
the mind: therefore does Saint Paul charge Christian servants to do their
duties with diligence in the presence of the Lord, Absque (...), that is to
say, without ( Eie-seruice,) and flattering fashion: thinking heerevpon, that
the Lord requires at their hands, a service from the heart, with a good mind,
and a good will.

Furthermore, this place of the Apostle, does most plainly disprove the error
of the Anabaptists and Libertines, who will have (forsooth) among Christians a
certain barbarous and brutish Which signifies rebellion, liberty, an
abolishing or utter displacing of rule and government, etc
Anarchie, that none may obeie other, but be all alike, cheek by choule
checkmate. For, they define Christian liberty amiss, in saying: that it is a
kind of manumission or setting free from all manner of service or bondage, as
well temporal as ecclesiastical: not knowing this, that Christian liberty
consists in the spirit, and not in the flesh.

Again, this place both teaches, and also comfort godly servants. It
teaches them verily, that the state of life, wherein they live, pleases God,
if they behave themselves according to the rule set down before them by Saint
Paul. It comfort them also, which are kept under with a service somewhat
hard and straight, whiles they, learning this lesson of Saint Paul, persuade
themselves, that they are not only subject to the will of God: but also take
this for a sure ground, that God counts that done to himself, which is done
with singleness to their masters after the flesh. Let no servant therefore,
neither he nor she, shake off their yoke of service, unless it may
lawefullie be brought to pass.

Verse. 8.
8 And know ye, that whatsoever good thing any man does, that same shall he
receive of the Lord, whether he be bond, or free. Knowing, that every one,
what good thing soever he does, shall receive of the Lord whether he be
bond, or free. SAint Paul adds a confirmation or proof, taken from a well
known speech uttered in Scripture. For God beats much upon this promise
every where in the Scriptures, Ruth. 2. 12
that he will remember our labor, 1. Sam. 26. 23.
and the work of our hands, promising a large reward to all them that obeie
his voice. 2. Chro. 15. 7.
Servants therefore ought to have an eye to this promise in their labors and
handie works, Psalm 18. 20
making this full account, Prou. 13. 21
that God is true and just in his promises, Esaie. 1. 19
and that the reward promised for their obedience, Esaie. 40. 10.
is to be looked for from God.

But, because the Papists abuse shamefullie, these and such like saiengs,
Esaie. 62. 11.
concerning the rewards of good works, to the overthrowing of Gods truth
touching free justification: Esaie. 65 6 7. 8. 9.
therefore I will briefly declare, how these and such like saiengs are to be
understood, Iere. 31. 14
according to the analogy, Tob. 4. 19.
proportion, Eccle. 11. 17.
and rule of faith.

First of all we must know, that these and such like general promises, Mat.
7. 11.
are to be applied unto all men, but not after one and the self same manner.
Psalm. 62. 12
For, there are two sorts of men, according to whose diversity, the
application of the promise must be made. For, some are godly, that is to say,
borne a new, and the children of God. Othersome are ungodly, not borne a new,
and the children of wrath.

If thou will apply the saiengs touching promises of rewards, to the latter
sort of men, thou prouest nothing else thereby, but that they remain the
children of wrath, under wrath. For, they are able to do nothing that can
please God, although their works hear an outward show of special holiness.
For, this Oracle of the holy Ghost abides always sure and steadfast,
Impossible est placere Deo, sine fide: It is impossible to please God, without
faith. Heb. 11. 6.
So long therefore as men are void of faith, they are like rotten trees, which
can bear no fruit. So that it may be concluded heerevpon, even by most
manifest and sound proof, that when God gives the wicked, the reward due to
their works, hell and damnation shall be their recompense.

But if thou will apply the promises of reward to the former sort of men: to
wit, the children of God, then must thou think upon these points in thy mind,
orderly. First of all, thou shall build upon this, that the godly are
delivered from the rigor of the law, through Christ, as S. Paul says: Gal.
3. 13.
Christus redemit nos, etc. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the
law, Gal. 4. 4. 5
being made a curse for us. Tit. 2. 14.
The condemning sentence therefore of the law, cannot hurt the children of
God: that is to say, the believers. Secondly thou shall consider, that the
believer may please God, by faith, and may be an heir of everlasting life.
Thirdly, thou shall persuade thy self, that God does not only require new
obedience at the hands of the believer: but also promises a reward: howbeit,
not of duty, for the worthiness of the work: but of his mere grace, for his
fatherly promise sake. Fourthlie, thou shall make this reckoning, that works
done by faith, are witnesses of faith: and the effects of faith, most assured
signs of their proper cause. Heerevpon God is said to pay every man his
reward, according to his works: because works are true evidences of faith, and
the fear of the Lord.

This solution or answer may trimly be made plainer, by a comparison
between the heavenly Father, and an earthly Father. For, as an earthly
Father does promise unto his children, sometime a large inheritance, sometime
a rich reward, etc. as the wages or reward for their work, if they show
themselves dutiful and obedient, although they were not heirs before by
nature: even so God the heavenly Father, promises to his children, whom he
loves in Christ, everlasting life, as the reward for their obedience showed by
faith. The promises of reward, being thus applied, stir up in the godly an
endeavor to obeie: besides that, they make nothing at all for proof of the
Papists wicked doctrine.

Verse. 9.
9 And ye masters, do the same things unto them, putting away threatenings:
and know that even your master is in heaven, neither is there respect of
person with him. And ye masters do ye the same things toward them, letting
go threatenings, knowing that even your master also is in heaven, and there
is not any respect of person with him. THis is the last exhortation touching
the several duties of one to an other, in their calling: and it answers that
which went next before. The Apostle requires two things of masters. The first
is, ( To do the same things unto them:) to wit, unto their servants, that they
keeping the right rule of proportion, may show to their servants good will
again for their service. For, the Apostle does not require in masters, such
and the like labors, such and the like diligence, such and the like
submission, as he requires in servants: but a duty answerable to their place
and person.

Let the servant therefore labor faithfully, and let the master again on
the other side, make much of his servant, give him his wages for his work, and
see that he lack nothing that is necessary: all this must be done, ( In
Domino, In the Lord.) For this is the meaning of the Apostle, when he says,
((...), The same things,) to the intent, that a just proportion of duty might
be kept, between the master, and the servant. The second thing, which the
Apostle requires of masters, is: ( To put away threatening.) By which word of
( Threatening,) he means all manner of hard handling toward their servants.

To this exhortation he adds a reason drawn from like matters, and says: (
And know, that even your master also is in heaven.) As if he should say,
There is no cause why ye should ouercrowe your servants, and think your selves
iollie fellows, in respect of them, for your maistership sake: no, no. For,
even ye your selves have a master also in heaven, who can be with you to
bring, notwithstanding your maistership, or the poverty of your servants,
which are not things that he is lead by. For, there is no respect of person
with him, as there is with wicked and unjust judges: but according to the truth
and uprightness of the cause, so he frames his judgment. For the Lord (says
S. Ambrose) is a righteous judge, looking upon the cause, and not eieng the
person. The word ( Person) in this place, does not signify the substance, but
the quality: that is to say, whatsoever is regarded in judgment, besides the
truth of the cause.

These words therefore ( Of respect of persons,) ought not to be wrested to a
contrary meaning. For, there is in them a comparison between God and men Men
(for the most part) give judgment after the things which they see with their
eyes, and which outwardly appear: they are moved with lineage or birth, with
riches, with kindred, and with friendship: again, sometimes with hatred, with
love, and other affections: whereby it comes to pass, that they ouerslipping
the truth and equity of the cause, give wrong judgment.

As for God, whose judgment is right, and according to truth, he changes not
his righteous judgment for the masters sake, not yet for the servant sake:
but he judges according to the truth of the cause, not having any regard to
this or that person. For he follows without stint, and incessantly, this
unremovable rule of justice. For, he receives the repentant into favor: as
for the unrepentant and stubborn, he cannot away with them, they are outlawes.

Heerehence all godly masters have to learn to humble themselves before God,
who is their master, as well as their servants master: and let them be
mindful, by his example, not to set their servants at naught, because of their
outward person: that is to say, their vile and base estate: but rather to make
more account of them. And why? For, although the condition of servant differ
from that of masters here on earth: yet notwithstanding, they have all one
master in heaven, whom both of them ought to serve and obeie, as
fellowe-seruaunts.

Verses. 10. and. 11.
10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
might.

11 Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the
assaults of the devil.

Touching that which remains my brethren, be ye strong in the Lord, and in
the power of his might, put ye on the whole armor of God, that ye may be
able to stand against the snares of the devil. THE Apostle returns to a
general exhortation, where (after the doctrine of grace, after exhortations to
virtues worthy of the Gospel, and after peculiar duties belonging to certain
several degrees of men,) he calls upon all the godly, under the name of the
Ephesians, and exhorts them to be strong in mind: taking unto them such
armor, as may withstand the snares of the devil: a very mighty enemy
doubtless, if we shall look upon his manifold assaults, his subtle
underminings, his sundry ways of laieng in wait, and our own strength,
which is but weakness: howbeit, a discomfited enemy, and not able to resist,
if we behold him, in whom rests our whole power and valiantness. For, when
we lean upon him, with a steddie and sure confidence: it comes to pass,
that the Devil, be he never so big, suffers shipwreck himself, though he
stirs up tempests, and raises storms, to sink the servants of God.

In the Apostles words, the manner of exhortation is to be marked. He says
thus, ( Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.) First, there is
signified unto to us, by this manner of exhorting, that without the Lord, and
without his mighty power, we can prevail nothing at all, against so terrible
and violent an enemy as the Devil. Secondly, that we being made members of
the Lord, are also made strong by his strength, to resist Satan and his fiery
weapons.

Of this strength we are then made partakers, when we trust to, and stay upon
our Lord Christ, with a lively confidence, when we are made the children of
God, and the members of Christ: which is evident by these words of the Apostle,
1. Ioh. 5.
Haec est victoria, etc. This is the victory which overcomes the world, even
your faith. Therefore, that strength which makes us able to withstand Satan
and the flesh, is not of nature, but of grace. And Christ is that strength, on
whom we lay fast hold by faith. Heereto serves that saying of Saint Paul,
1. Tim. 18. 19.
Milita honestam militiam, etc. Fight a good fight, having faith and a good
conscience, which some have put away, and as concerning faith have made
shipwreck.

And although this strength comes from the Lord: yea, the Lord himself is
that strength: yet notwithstanding, when the Apostle exhorts us to ( Be
strong,) and to ( Put on the whole armor of God,) he requires our travel and
endeavor. It is necessary therefore, that our will should run actiuelie
therewithal, and not only passiuelie. For, as we may, if we will, cast off
faith, and resist the holy spirit: so being converted and turned, we can keep
faith and the holy spirit by grace, and stir up the gift of God in us, 2.
Tim. 1. 6.
as Saint Paul speaks. For, the gift of God is a certain quick and lively
flame, as it were, in the hearts of believers, which Satan and the flesh can
smoother and choke up: whiles we lie slugging and snorting in our neasts.
Wherefore, S. Paul's warning to Timothy is not in waste, where he says: 2.
Tim. 1. 6.
Stir up the gift of God which is in thee. This gift therefore must not be
quenched and put out. To the same purpose also serves that saying of the
Apostle to the Thessalonians, 1. These 5. 19.
Quench not the spirit.

It is the part of a Christian man therefore to walk warily, and carefully
before his God: and evermore to take heed, that he lose not the gift, which
he has received by grace, through his own slothfulness and idleness. To
this belong all exercises of goodlinesse, all exhortations of godly
Shepherds, and the whole discipline of the Church. For, these are certain
bellows, as it were, which do quicken and raise up the flame kindeled in us
from above, by Gods good grace.

Moreover, this place of Saint Paul does teach all the godly, that they are
set in a very hot and heavy skirmish, where they must fight it out, every
one in his standing: looking for no truce, because there is none to be
granted. For, our adversary is always harnessed, weaponed, and keeping the
field. And indeed (as Saint Peter says) He never rests raunging up and
down, 1. Pet. 5. 8.
roaring (like a Lioness that has lost her whelps,) and seeks whom he may
devour. This does he one while by offering open violence, another while by
crafty saying in wait.

For, when he puts men in the head, to cast from them, as a thing of naught,
the doctrine of God: when he brings in a train of most filthy manners,
slatte against the law of God: when he fills all places with offenses, and
slaughters: then offers he open violence, and professes himself the sworn
enemy of Christ. But when he disguiseth himself into an angel of light, and
puts upon vices the vizards of virtues: when he gives superstition a
counterfaite face of holiness: when he deals in this wise, then he lies in
wait craftily to catch us. To them therefore, which are not furnished with
the whole armor of GOD, the devil is more terrible, furious, violent, and
prevailing.

What shall we gather by this? Seeing the life of a Christian in this world, is
a certain spiritual warfare and that against so mighty an enemy: it is
meet verelie, that we be like to, and also play the part of valiant hearted
soldiers, whom swilling, surfeiting, or sleeping make not slothful and
heauie-headed, being to seek in the time of most need: but always provided
and prepared at the pinch, ready to fight with their enemies, hand to hand:
least they should be set upon, and ouerrunne at unawares. Thus if we do, we
need doubt no danger. For, when the Apostle adds these words, ( That ye may
be able to stand against the assaults of the devil,) he means, that we shall
overcome, and get the victory, if we holding fast the armor, which God
reaches out and gives us, shall fight stoutly under Christ's banner, having
full confidence in him.

The rightest way to overcome this invisible enemy, is, if thou begin with
thine inward and household enemy, to tame him, and bring him under. This enemy
is the flesh, against whom the spirit makes batell. For the flesh tempts us
with nothing, but that fleshly thing, which bears rule in us: and thither
she bends her full force, whither she sees men inclined of their own
accord. And so ye flesh turns our own weakness, to the weapons of her
wickedness, and uses the disease of our own flesh against our selves: that
is to say, sets upon us with our own affections, lusts, and desires, as it
were with warlike engines.

But if any one demand, why God gives the Devil leave to haunt and lay such
hard hold at mankind, in this manner? Athanasius answers in these words: That
they (says he) which love God, In his eleventh question to Antiochus.
may be made manifest: and they that are given to vain pleasures may be
turned off, and put away. For, if there were no enemies to make war, how
should the valiant soldiers of a king be tried? To them therefore that love
God, the Devil is made the cause of victory, of their crown or garland, of
their reward and triumph. Thus far Athanasius. But I answer in a word, that
it is Gods decree and appointment, to have all his children made like unto his
son, in the cross and persecution, whom his purpose was long ago, to
glorify with his son.

Verse. 12.
12 For, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
and against powers, and against the worldly governors, the princes of the
darkness of this world, against spiritual vvickednesses, which are in the
high places. Because our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities (or rules,) against powers, against the worldly governors of
the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickednesses, in heavenly
places. THis is a reason of the exhortation, drawn from the greatness of the
danger. For, after he has set forth the fearful power of a fearful
enemy, he stirs up the Ephesians to the greater watchfulness, least they
should suffer themselves to be ouerrunne of so crafty and mighty an enemy.
For, the Apostle declares and lays open before our eyes, the forces of our
enemies to this end: that thereby he might make us the more ready and
courageous to fight. Now, in that the Apostle says, ( We wrestle not against
flesh and blood,) he does not deny, that we must have a skirmishing against
men, and our own flesh: but he speaks by way of comparison, as if he should
say thus: If we look upon the spiritual enemies, whom we have haunting us,
that skirmishing shall be accounted no fight, which is between us and flesh
and blood.

By this manner of speech therefore, the greatness of the danger, the kind
of the battle, and the quality of the enemies, are signified and meant. Our
enemies are not flesh and blood: therefore our enemies are spiritual. The
battle which we must abide, is spiritual, doubtful, and dangerous:
therefore spiritual weapons are required, as S. Paul also puts us in
mind, saying: Non sunt carnalia, 2. Co. 10.
etc. The weapons of our warrefare, are not carnal, but mighty through God:
that is to say, spiritual.

Now, when the Apostle calls our enemies, ( Principalities, powers, etc.) he
does not reckon up diverse orders and degrees of devils: but he describes the
power of those same enemies, by sundry names. For, when he calls devils, by
the name of (...), that is to say, ( Principalities) and Empires, he does not
only admonish us, that they are not enemies lightly to be set by* as though
they were not able to make any power, or had not in them strength to resist:
but he also requires us, to shake off their yoke, and cast it from us: which
we then do, when we defy and forsake them, by faith and trust in Christ. For,
they bear rule over none, but such, as of their own accord, put their necks
under the yoke, and are content to wear it* For, principality and subjection
are correlatiues: that is to say, things of such a quality, that where the
one is, the other must be.

Again, when the Apostle calls devils (...): that is to say, ( Powers,) by
which he signifies, a right in ruling: which devils execute and put in ure
over men, for sins sake, and that by Gods just judgment. By this name
therefore we are put in mind, to fly from all and every sin, as being
delivered from sin by and through Christ, least the devil make claim to his
right, and get rule over us again.

The name which follows next, is (...): that is to say, rulers of the world:
which signifies, that devils have the oversight and dealing in evil deeds
only, and that they hold them under their yoke, which are entangled and
caught with the baits of worldly desires. For this word ( World) does not
signify in this place, this goodly frame and compass, created of God, and
furnished with store of all things, which God alone fashioned and made of his
goodness for man to live in: but it signifies worldly minded men, sleeping
in sin, and the very sins themselves: as plainly is proved by the
exposition following, when he defines the world to be darkness. Now, it is
commonly known, that by darkness, the ignorance of God, and any other
sin whatsoever, is meant. As therefore Christ rules and governs them,
which are light: so the devil pricketh forward, and throws headlong into all
mischief and villainy, those that are darkness.

Lastly, when Saint Paul adds these words: ( Against spiritual
wickednesses, which are in the high places,) he gives us thereby to note, the
nature of our enemies. For, they are spiritual enemies. Thereby also he
shows us, that they are swift and invisible: by the former we are willed to
take heed, because the danger is great: by the latter to beware, because the
snares and assaults are secreat. For, when our enemies are invisible, they are
about our overthrow, even then, when we do least of all think it. We ought
therefore to be precise and wary, least we be set upon, sooner than we
think.

Heereto serves the word ( Wickednesses,) whereby, as the endeavor and order
of devils to deceive is signified: so are the godly warned, continually to
watch and ward against so wicked and mischievous an enemy, who will take no
conditions of trace, nor enter into any league, unless we yield up our
selves wholly unto his power and rule, renouncing the faith of Christ. Touching
that which is added: to wit, ( In the high or heavenly places:) it is
diversely expounded. Saint Ambrose understands the firmament of the world, by
high or heavenly places: other some understand thereby, this dark and mistie
aier: other understand by it, heavenly things: for which (say they) is all
this fighting and skirmishing. For, this battle is taken in hand, not about
the kingdoms of the world, but about heavenly things. And surely, although
the matter be so indeed: yet notwithstanding, the plainer meaning is this: to
wit, that the place is noted from whence our enemies shall lay load at us. For,
they set upon us from aloft, and are even upon our necks: in such sort, that
they never rest from trieng of masteries, no not the twinkling of an eye. This
therefore whereto serves it? Even to put us in mind, how doubtful and dangerous
an encounter it is, to come out and wage battle with such an enemy, who can,
even by the nature of his place easily set upon us, soon down with us
underfoot, and dispatch us with the turning of an hand.

Verse. 13.
13 For this cause take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able
to resist in the evil day, and having finished all things, stand fast. Take
unto you therefore the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to resist in
the evil day, and stand fast when all things are finished. THis is a
conclusion and repetition of the proposition, which is entered in this manner.
The enemies of the Church are mighty and malicious: therefore it is meet,
that Christians, being furnished with the whole armor, or complet harness of
God, set themselves against their enemies: at this time specially, when all
things are full of doubts, troubles, and dangers. For, the Apostle calls the
whole time of skirmishing, by the name of ( The evil day:) which indeed is
not evil of it self, or by nature: but it is called evil, in respect of the
troubles and dangers which then do chance. The reason of the proposition
rehearsed, is very full of comfort. For, it promises, that the children of
God shall certeinlie have the victory, if so be they hold out, and abide the
brunts stoutly, under the banner of Christ. For, when the Apostle says, ( And
having finished all things, stand fast,) he requires labor in skirmishing,
without weariness, and continual constancy, even till the encounter be done:
that is to say, even to the end of this frail life, after which shall follow
a glorious triumph over our enemies.

Out of this place of Saint Paul, our Ancients seem to have taken the
difference of the Church, calling one, The Church militant: the other, The
Church triumphant: not that they are two sundry Churches: but because of the
condition of the citizens of the same Church. For, whiles we are in this life,
our whole life is a kind of warfare against the flesh, the world, and the
devil. To this pertains that saying of Job, Job. 7. 1. 2.
Militia est vita nostra super terram, Our life is a warfare upon earth. But
when we shall depart out of this life, we shall be partakers of Christ's
triumph, so that we shall be no more in danger of Satan's deadly shot.

Verse. 14.
14 Stand therefore, and your loins girt about with verity. Stand therefore,
and your loins girded about with truth. NOw follows a declaration of the
armor of God, which Saint Paul would have us wear, against the snares and
assaults of the devil: wherein (by the figures Hypotyposis, and Metaphora, he
describes the spiritual armor of our minds, making an allusion to the
armor of the soldiers of this world. And first of all, the Apostle will have
us gird up our loins with truth. What this should mean shall soon appear,
when the Metaphore is made more plain. For, as the loins, wherein the
special power and strength of the body does lie, are girt up with a girdle,
least the soldier in fighting should fall and miscarrie: so the mind must be
made steddie and fast, with the truth of God, least the devil lay us along
the more easily, and slaie us the sooner, when he finds us doubtful,
wavering, and inconstant.

Let the mind therefore of a Christian soldier, whiles he is in this hot
skirmish, be first of all persuaded of Gods truth. Heereth serves that saying
of our Lord in the Gospel: Luke. 12. 35.
Sint lumbi vestri, etc. Let your loins be girded about, and your lights
burning. This speech of our Savior Christ, requires as well constancy in
doctrine, as also innocence in manners. And Saint Peter says, Praecincti
lumbis, 1. Pet. 1. 13
etc. Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind: be sober, and trust
perfectly on the grace that is brought unto you, by the the revelation of
Jesus Christ.

Verse. 14.
14 And having on the breast plate of righteousness. VVearing on the breast
plate of righteousness. Here the breast is defended. For, as the breast plate
defends the breast of a wordlie soldier, so innocence of life, or
righteousness, defends a man's mind, and so harnesseth it, that the weapons
of the devil have no power to pearse unto the heart, and to quench the
religion of Christ, there abiding.

Verse. 15.
15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace. Your feet
shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace. AS soldiers defend their
feet, to the end they may be safe, when they are going to battle: so it
behooves Christian soldiers to be shod with the Gospel: to the intent they
may hold out stoutly in skirmish, not being once harmed. For this word (
Preparation,) the Greeks use, (...), whereby is signified a certain
readiness and cheerfulness, wherewith the faithful do embrace the Gospel
of peace. The Genitive case ( Pacis, of peace) has the place of an Epitheton,
or Adjective: and under the name of ( Peace,) the fruit of the Gospel is
meant. For, the Gospel is a proclamation touching the atonement and
reconciliation between God and us.

Verse. 16.
16 Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith ye may quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked. Above all things, taking unto you the shield of
faith, wherewith ye may be able to put out all the darts of the wicked. AS the
whole body is defended and saved with the shield, that it may be kept safe
from blows, and wounds: so an ardent and undoubted faith keeps and defends
the mind every where from having hurt. And as the shield is held out, to
bear off the darts and strokes of our enemies weapons: so a true faith ought
to be set against all kind of temptations. Touching this matter, there are
more examples rehearsed in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The Apostle calls
deadly darts, ( Fiery darts:) by the figure Metalepsis. For he alludeth to
the fashion and dealing of warriors, who in old time, besmeered the heads of
their darts with poison, that the bodies of the wounded might so be inflamed,
as that it should not be possible to heal them, and make them sound again.

Verse. 17.
17 And take the helmet of salvation. And take the helmet of health, (or
salvation.) AS the head being defended with an helmet, is safe: so hope of
salvation to come, must be set flat against every assault of the devil. For,
from this hope springs most abundant comfort in all adversities. It is called
( The helmet of salvation,) by the figure Metonymia: to wit, 1. These. 5. 8.
because it saves harmless. This helmet of salvation, our Apostle calls by
the name of hope, in his Epistle to the Thessalonians.

Verse. 17.
17 And the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. is And the sword
of the spirit, which Gods word. THus far the Apostle has armed a Christian
soldier, with those weapons and harness, wherewith he may safely withstand
the assaults of the devil. Now he delivers him in hand a sword, with the
which he may set upon his enemy, and drive him back. And because the enemy
is spiritual, it is convenient, that the sword also be spiritual, wherewith
he may be put to flight: even the same sword, which the Lord himself smote
Satan withal, and made him take his heels, when he presumed to tempt and
encounter with Christ. Math. 4. 1 2. 3, etc.
This is the sword of the Lords own mouth, wherewith he slaieth the
ungodly. For, so often as we give the devil the foil, by the word of the
Lord, he is laid along with the sword of the Lords own mouth.

But heed must be had here, least we be entangled in the error of the
Papists, and embrace the letter for the spirit. For, the words of the Apostle
are not meant of any sorcerous rehearsal of words, or of the cast of
coniuring, spoken and done according to the words specified (as though there
were some forceablenesse in the sound of the words, besides that which it has
by the ordinance and appointment of God:) neither are they meant of the writing
of the words, and the hanging of them about our neck: (as they thought, the
beginning of Saint John's Gospel, written in fine parchment, and hanged about
ones neck, to be the same swords of the spirit, which S. Paul speaks of in
this place.) But the word of God, then: yea, even then, is the spiritual
sword, when it is forceable in us by faith, and when it is written in the
tables of our heart, by the spirit of God. For then in deed this sword is fit,
and serves well, for the defacing and dispatching of our adversary the devil.

Heerehence it appears, how cruel a tyrant Antichrist of Rome is, who
bestirres him all that he may, to take from Gods people this sword of the
spirit: not only by falsifieng and wresting the Scripture to a contrary and
unnatural meaning: but also by making laws, that it should not be set forth
in a common and known tongue, for the behoof of Gods Church, that every one
might read and understand it.

Verse. 18.
18 And pray alvvaies, with all manner prayer, and supplication, in the
spirit: and vvatch thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
Saints, and for me. Praieng always in spirit, with all manner of prayer and
supplication: and watching to this end, with all continuance (or instance) and
supplication, for all Saints, and for me. THe Apostle having furnished the
Christian soldier, with double armor, brings him unto his Captain, to
march stoutly and manfully under his banner: and if the skirmish be too
dangerous, to fly for succor unto his Captain, least he be ouertroden of
his mighty and strong enemy. For, by prayer we come to Christ our Captain:
provided always, that this prayer be not a babbling with the lips: but a
lifting up of the heart in faith unto God, joined with a devout sound of the
mouth, all being done with a sure tr^^^, and confidence in Christ our
mediator.

Now, what it is to pray in spirit, Saint Ambrose shows by a very trim
antithesis or opposition, in these words: Hoc est ergo, etc. This is therefore
to pray always in spirit, even to make our prayers unto God, with a clean
conscience, and an upright faith. For, he prays in the flesh, which prays
with a defiled mind. Thus far he.

As for that which is added: to wit, ( For all Saints, and for me,) it serves
to this end, that the endeavor of succouring and assisting one an other in this
spiritual warfare, might be commended unto us. For, we ought to use these two
weapons: namely, ( The sword of the spirit,) and ( Prayer,) not only in
defense of our selves: but also for the helping and aiding of others,
specially, when we see them in danger. And although we must pray for all men:
yet notwithstanding, we must have principal care and regard to the Saints:
that is to say, to them that are joined with us by faith and love, being in
deed members of one, and the same mystical body, as well as we.

Touching the words of the Apostle last set down: ( And for me,) they put the
godly in mind of their duty: which is, to pray continually for the
ministers of Gods word, and for the preservation and maintenance of their
ministry.

Verses. 19. and. 20.
19 That utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly,
to publish the secret of the Gospel,

20 Whereof I am the Ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly,
as I ought to speak.

That speech may be given me, in the opening of my mouth, with boldness, that
I may utter (or declare) the mystery of the Gospel, whereof I bear
embassage in chains, that I may behave my self boldly therein, a sit
becomes me to speak. THe causes why Saint Paul desires the Ephesians to
pray for him, are set down, and they are three in number. The first, ( That
he might open his mouth boldly:) that is to say, that a constant mind might
be given unto him, whereby to confess and profess the doctrine of the
Gospel, without fear, before the whole world. For, he calls the opening of
the mouth, a free confession of doctrine, simple, plain, clear, without
dissembling, counterfeiting, and cauilling, without fear, and doubting to
displease, which often times does so shut up and make fast the mouths of a
great many, as they remember not, that it is the embassage of Christ Jesus,
which they have in charge.

Here all the godly, and specially the ministers of Gods word, are
admonished, what boldness of confession ought to be in them: to wit, that no
fear, no heaviness, no threatenings, no torments make them give over: but
that they may teach and preach the Gospel with a courage.

The second cause is, ( That I should publish the secret of the Gospel.) For,
this is peculiar to Paul, and the ministers of the word, that by preaching,
even with their own voice, they should publish the secret of the Gospel. This
place therefore is at defiance with the Anabaptists, who coutemning the word
uttered by voice, look for reuelatious, visions, inspirations, and I wot not
what. But what is that which is added.
