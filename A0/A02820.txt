A Joyful medytacyon to all England: of the coronacyon of our most natural
sovereign lord king Henry the eight


The prologue
THe prudent problems / and the noble works
Of the gentle poets in old antyquyte
Unto this day has made famous clerks
For the poets Wrote nothing in vanyte
But grounded them on good moralyte
Encensynge out the fair dulcet fume
Our langage rude to exyle and con^^^^
The right eloquent poet and monk of bery
Made many fair books / as it is probable
From idle derkenes / to light our emyspery
Whose virtuous pastyme / was much commendable
Presentynge his books / gretely prouffytable
(...)
To your worthy predecessor the.v. king Henr^
Which regystred is in the court of memory
Amyddes the medowe of flora the queen
Of the gods elycon / is the spring or well
And by it grows / a fair laurel grene
Of which the poets do often write and tell
Beside this olyue / I did never dwell
To taste the water which is aromatyke
For to cause me write with lusty rethoryke
Wherefore good sovereign / I beseech your hyghnes
To pardon me which do rudely endyte
As in this art having small intres
But for to learn is all mine appetyte
In following the monk which did nobly write
Besechynge your hyghnes and grace debonayre
For to accept this rude and little quayre
Explicit prologus.
O God alone in heaven werynge crown
In whose inspecte is every regal se
Both to enhau^ce and for to cast adowne
Such is ye power of thy^ high magiste
Neither hardynes treasour nor dygnyte
May withstand thy strength which is i^ every place
So great and mighty is thy dyuyne grace
Two tytles in one thou dydest well vnyfye
When the read rose took the white in marriage
Reygnynge together right high and noblye
From whose vnyd tytyls and worthy lygnage
Descended is by right excellent courage
King Henry the.viii. for to reygne doutles
Unyuersall his fame honor and larges
Which has spousyd a fair flower of virtue
Descended of (...) dame katheryn of Spain
By grace and prudens the peace to attain
Wherefore England thou needs not complain
Sith thou have crowned openly in sight
This king and queen by good true love and right
What should I show by perambulacyon
All this great tryumphe of which report
Is made about now in every nacyon
Unto all this realm to be Joy and comfort
Wherefore you lords I humby you exhort
Spyrytuall and temporal with the comyns vnyfyde
To give god the praise which does grace provide
England be glad / the dew of grace is spread
The dew of Joy / the dew wholesome and soote
Dystylled is now from the rose so red
And of the white so spryngynge from the root
After our trouble to be refute and boot
This ryall tree was planted as I know
By god above the rancour to down throw
Who is the flower that does this grace dystyll
But only Henry the.viii. king of his name
With golden drops all England to fulfill
To show his larges his honor and his fame
His deeds thereto exemplefye the same
Wherefore now England with hole devotion
For this young king make daily orayson
Our late sovereign his fader excellent
I know right well some hold oppynyon
That to auaryce he had entendement
Gadrynge great richesse of this his regyon
But they little know by their small reason
For what hye entente he gadered doutles
Unto his grace such innumerable riches
For I think well and god had sent him (...)
As they have meruaylled much of this gadrynge
So it to them should have been affyrmatyfe
To have had great wonder of his spending
It may fortune he thought to have mouynge
Of mortal war our faith to stablysshe
Against the turks their power to mynysshe
But sith that death by his course natural
Has him arested / and would not delay
Like wise as he was so be we mortal
How / where / or when I came nothing say
Therefore to god above let us all pray
For to grant him mercy which was our king
Bringing his soul to Joy everlasting
A fair England mystruste the right naught
Regard right well / his sons Justice
Se how that they which inuencyons sought
Delytynge them in the sin of auaryce
To oppress the comyns by great preiudyce
Does he not punysshe them according to law
Such new promocyons to dampne and withdraw
Saturn
Fie on the saturn with thy mysty fume
Replete with fraud treason and wyckednes
To show thy beams thou dare not presume
So cursed thou art withouten stablenes
Deuoyde of graceful fulfilled with doblenes
Thy power to England was never amyable
But always evil untrue and varyable
Iupyter.
Now gentle Iupyter the lodesterre of light
Thy steadfast beams so fair and so clear
Cast now abrede that we may have a sight
To glad us all when that they do appear
Sendynge down truth from thy fulgent spear
For to make our hertes mekely to enclyne
To serve our sovereign which does now domyne
O mighty Mars o god of the war
O flambynge honor of every hardy heart
Send down thy power truly from so far Mars

Us to encourage that we do not sterte
But by hardynes that we may subuerte
Our soueraynes enemies to him contraryous
By bataylles fyerse ryghtfull and rygorous
And thou fair bright / and aureate phoebus Phoebus

Encreace now light with love and honor
Among the lords so gay and gloryus
With thy radyant beams so hye of favor
Deuoydynge all treachery debate and rancoure
And yllumyne the mind with lyberalyte
Of our good sovereign with wealth and unity
And lady Uenus with thy sone Cupyde Uenus

Of every lord do now the heart enspyre
With fervent love that he do not slide
And of the comyns set the hertes on fire
To love our sovereign with their hole desire
Following his grace with dulcet armonye
To the ryghtfull way withouten Ieoperdye
Also thou Mercury the god of eloquence Mercur^

The gentle sterre of grace and virtue
Thy beams of right peace and conscience
On our kings counsayll down send and renew
The truth of Justice / that they may extue
For to do wrong by the sin of couetyce
That here before has done great preiudyce
And thou watery dyane of the se the gods Luna

With thy brother eolus the god of the wind
Encourage the hertes by in ward hardynes
(...)
And enmyes rise that they be not behind
Them for to chase and the se to scour
By grace and fortune in many a stormy stoure
O god above / trononysed in heaven
In whose will rests every thing alone
The sky / the earth / with all the planettes seven
Without whose grace / comfort have we none
As thou art three enclusyd in one
So save our sovereign / from all manner woe
And this his realm from mortal war also
Holy church rejoice / with all your lybertees
Withouten do^mage / the king will ye encreace
And be your shield from all aduersytees
No wrong shall be but he will it soon seace
Knyttynge the knotte of faith love and peace
Between you and him without dysturbaunce
So for to endure by long contynuaunce
Right mighty prince our good sovereign lord
To god enclynynge be hardy and glad
Of you and your realm he will se concord
Though other nacyons be therefore full sad
Against you murmuring with their works badde
Yet dread ye nothing for god with his might
Will be always ready to defend the right
Right noble / wise / and excellent pryncesse
Right benygne lady / lyberall and virtuous
Dyscended lynyally of the line of nobleness
Fair queen Katheryne so sweet and precious
To our sovereign espoused with Joy solacyous
Almighty god give grace to multyplye
From you your flowers to reygne right ryally
And lady Mary princes right beauteuous
Endued with honor / virtue / and prudence
Right meke / goodly / gentle and gracyous
Sister right dear unto the excellence
Of our good sovereign / surmountynge in sapyence
Right fair young lady / the great lord above
He grant you grace / high fame / fortune and love
And all you lords and ladies honorable
And you noble knights so hauntynge chyualry
Unto our sovereign be meke and tendable
Which will reward you well and nobly
As to show his largess universally
Encouragynge your hertes ye courage chyualrous
In time of battle for to be vyctoryous
And all ye officers of every degree
Beware extorcyon / for and it be known
No doubt it is but ye shall punysshed be
Take heed of them / the which be overthrown
Remember well how fortune has blown
The promoters down / and casting them full low
In following them ye shall fall as I trow
England be true and love well each other
Obey your sovereign / and god omnypotent
Which is above / of all the world the rother
Will send you wealth / from whom all good is sent
He give us grace to keep his commandment
And save our sovereign / with his semely queen
With all their blood / without trouble and tene
Amen.
Excusacio auctoris
Go little treatise submyt the humbly
To our sovereign lord / to be in his presence
Besechynge his grace to accept the mekely
And to pardon thy rudenes and neclygence
To compyle those matters which (...)
Unto his hyghnes and regal majesty
Now ye fair ladies / wise and virtuous
I right humbly pray you for to condyscende
To accept my making nothing facundious
I would that fortune would conning extend
That mine endytynge I might than amend
To dyrecte my matters after your pleasaunce

AMEN
