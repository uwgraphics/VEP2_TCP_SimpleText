A Pleasant new Ballad you here may behold, How the Devil, though subde, was
guld by a Scold.
To the tune of, The Seminary Priest.


GIve ear, my loving Contrymen,
that still desire news,
Nor pass not while you hear it sung,
or also the song peruse.
For ere you hear it, I must tell
my news, it is not common,
But, I Will unfold a truth betwixt
a Devil and a woman.
Tom Thumb is not my subject,
Whom Fairies often did aid,
Nor that mad spirit Robin
that plagues both wife and maid,
Nor is my song satyricke like,
invented against no man,
But only of a pranke betwixt
a Devil and a woman.
Then widows, wives and maids,
give ear as well as men,
And by this woman learn
to gull the world again:
You may by this turn artists,
or masters of your Art,
And when the Devil comes for you,
you need not cars a fart.
A woman well in years,
lived with a husband kind,
Who had a great desits
to live content in mind.
But it was a thing unpossible
to compass his desire,
For night and day with scolding
she did her husband tire.
With toughish, lowtish clown,
despite thee I Will be wild,
Doast thou think I married thee
to use thee like a child,
And set thee on my lap,
or humor what your speak?
Before I Will be so fond,
thy very heart I Will break.
Why loving wife, quoth he,
I Will never do thee wrong,
So thou wilt be ruled by me,
and only hold thy tongue,
And when I come from work.
wilt please at board and bed.
Do this my loving wife,
and take all being dead.
Mark well quoth she, my words,
what ere you speak me to,
By fair means or by foul,
the contrary I Will do.
According to her speech,
this man led such a life,
That often he wished the Devil
to come and fetch his wife.
Had he bid her go homely,
why then she would go brave,
Had he'cal'd her good wise.
she called him rogue and slave:
Bade he, wife go to Church,
and take the fairest pew,
She Would go unto an Alehouse,
and drink, lie down and spew.
The Devil being merry
with laughing at this mirth,
Would needs from hell come trotting
to fetch her from the earth,
And coming like a horse,
to tell this man his mind,
Saying, Set her but astride my back,
I Will ^^rry her through the wind.
The second part, To the same tune.


Kind Devil quoth the man,
if thou a while wilt wait,
I Will bid her do that thing
shall make her back thee straight.
And here I Will make a vow,
for all she is my wife,
I Will never send for her again
whilst I have breath or life.
Content the Devil cried,
then to his wife goes he,
Good wife go lead that horse
so black and fair you see.
Go lea^e, sir knave, quoth she?
and wherefore not go ride?
She took the Devil by the reins,
and up she goes affride.
The Devil neighed loud,
and threw his heels in the air,
Kick in the Devils name, quoth she,
a shrew does never fear.
Away to hell he went.
with this most wicked scold,
But she did curb him with the bit,
and would not loose her hold.
The more he cried, Give way,
the more she kept him in,
And kick him so with both her heels,
that both his sl^es were thin.
Alight the Devil cried,
and quick the bridle loose.
No, I will ride (quoth she)
whiles thou have breath or shoes.
Again she kicked and pricked,
and sat so stiff and well,
The Devil was not so plagued,
a hundred years in hell.
For pity light (quoth he)
thou put'st me to much pain,
I will not light (quoth she)
till I come home again.
The Devil showed her all
the pains within that place,
And told her that they were
ordained for Scolds so base.
Being bereft of breath,
for scolding it is my due,
But whilst I live on earth,
I Will be revenged on you.
Then did she draw her knife,
and gave his ear a slit,
The Devil never felt
the like from mortal yet.
So fearing further danger,
he to his heels did take,
And faster th^n he came,
he poast have home did make.
Here take her (quoth the Devil)
to keep her here be bold,
For hell will not be troubled
with such an earthly scold.
When I come home, I may
to all my fellows tell,
I lost my labor and my blood,
to bring a scold to hell.
The man half dead did stand,
away the Devil bide.
Then since the world nor hell
can well a scold abide:
To make a sail of ships
let husbands fall to work,
And give their free consent^
to send them to the Turk.
Then honest wives and maids,
and widows of each sort,
Might live in peace and rest,
and Silence keep her court.
Nor would I have a scold
one penny here bestow,
But honest men and wives
buy these before you go.
FINIS.

Gate.
