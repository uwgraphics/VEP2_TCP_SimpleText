THE FRENCH KINGS DECLARATION UPON THE TRVCE BY HIS MAJESTY, granted to the
king of Navarre, containing the special causes and reasons thereto moving him.
Henry by the grace of God, king of France and Poland. To our trusty and
well-beloved, the Officers of our courts of Parliament, governors and lieutenants
general of our Provinces, Bailiffes, Seneschalles, Prouostes, or their
Lieutenants, and to all other our officers and subjects, to whom it may
appertain, Greeting. If the truth of things be judged by that which appears
unto men, as it ought to be, since they can have no other certain proof, and
that to God only it appertains to search the inward parts and affections of
men's hearts: the sincerity of our zeal and devotion to the holy faith, and
Catholic, Apostolic and Roman religion does sufficiently defend it self
against all slanders and deceits, by the proofs which we have yielded from
our youth, and always continued, as well in our life and ordinary profession,
as in furthering by all means, yea even by arms, without sparing our own
life, the advancement of Gods glory, and establishment of the said
Catholic, Apostolic and Roman religion in all places of this Realm, where
it has been changed and altered through the bringing in of a new opinion, to
our great grief and displeasure. Wherein our principal hinderance has not
proceeded so much of the industry and force of the followers and defenders of
the said new opinion, as of others, who shrowding themselves under a false
pretense of zeal to the said Catholic Religion, have a long time sought to
seduce the most part of our Catholic Subjects by false persuasions, and
practiced a League and secret association among themselves: whereof they were
the chiefetaines, under color of assuring after us (if God should call us out
of this world without issue) the preservation of the said Catholic religion,
against such of the new opinion as might pretend to succeed us in this Crown.

But their end and purpose tending to the usurpation and parting of the same
among themselves, after they had made them a party among our said Catholic
subjects, and underpropped them selves by intelligences with strangers, who
might seek the weakening of this Realm, to increase their authority and
greatness. They have displayed against our person and authority, the secrets
of their damnable driftes: First by backbiting and misreporting our actions, to
bring them into hatred with our people, and to draw their affections to
themselves under a plausible hope which they joined with the pretense of
religion, viz. to ease them of the charges, which the troubles of the time had
brought upon them: yet nevertheless their behauiours in places under their
command, were no favorable witnesses of their promises in that behalf. Then
being impatient of farther stay, they took and levied arms openly against us,
the fruit whereof should principally turn to their particular profit, in
respect of such advantages and conditions as they would have wrested from us.
The effect of the same importing no other then the ruin and destruction of our
subjects and all advancement of the Catholic religion, against the which the
continual enterprises of the aforesaid against us and our authority, have
debarred us from doing that endeavor that had been requisite to repress their
proceedings. And in case the first assayes of their said armies were pernicious
to this state, the sequel is yet more hurtful and dangerous, having by their
subtilties newly replenished France with trouble and universal civil war,
seditions, contempt of magistrates, blood, pillage, ransomings, sack of goods
both sacred and profane, forcing of women and maidens, and infinite other kinds
of inhumanities and disorders, such as the like was never seen or heard of,
and all to the great prejudice not only of our authority and royal person
(against whom they have openly declared themselves, not being ashamed to
publish that they sought after our very life) but also of this flourishing
Crown in general, which they purpose to share and dismember among themselves,
with the association of strangers to the great dishonor and obloquie of the
French name, but specially of the nobility in old time of such fame and
estimation through out the whole world for their virtue, prowess and singular
love and fidelity to their Kings: yea and which is worse, to the great
detriment of the Catholic, Apostolic: Roman religion. For besides that civil
war corrupts good manners, and alienateth men's hearts no less from all piety
and reverence to the honor of God, then from all human charity: this
division is the very means for those of the contrary opinion to enlarge and
ncrease their conquests. The which nevertheless we purposing to prevent to our
power, and endeavoring to reduce all things into a good order, whereto through
Gods grace we had brought them, and where from we were diuerted through these
present troubles, we have yet since the beginning of ye same sought al means
to us possible by courtesy to reduce all our Catholic subjects to a good and
firm reunion under our obedience, and by the means of the same to put in
execution that which, at their instant request we promi-sed in the assembly of
our Estates.

Howbeit so far was the hardness of their hearts from being mollified or
bent to any compassion of so many mischiefs which they have caused, as not
content with the disorders passed, no not with the raising of most of our
towns against us, the slaying, imprisoning or deposing of our officers, the
ransoming of the wealthiest of ourrealme of what degree, state, quality, kind,
condition or age soever, yea even the Clergy, the breaking of our seals,
defacing of our arms, renting and shameful handling of our pictures, the
establishing of Counsels and officers at their own fantasies, the spoiling of
our treasury, with all other acts of contempt, derision, hostility and
cruelty: but also heaping injury upon injury, they prepared to come and assail
our own person with artillery taken out of our storehouses, and armies composed
as well of our said rebellious subjects as of strangers in part contrary to the
Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion, whereof they nevertheless proclaim
themselves the only protectors, to the end together with our selves to
oppress all our good Catholic subjects and servant, in steed of addressing
themselves against those of the contrary opinion whom they suffer in peace and
liberty to stretch as far as they list, as indeed they have not ouerslipped
the occasion. For the king of Navarre while we were preparing and furnishing
our selves of forces for our warrantize against the bad intents of the said
rebels, took and seized upon our towns of Niort, S. Maixant, Maillezais,
Chastelleraut, Lodune, Lisle Bouchart, Montreuilbelay, Argenton, and Blanc in
Berry, and advanced his forces near to this town, whither we were come upon
the first day of his said exploits, to the end to take what order we could for
the stopping of him from proceeding any farther. Thus in the end knowing our
selves unable to perform with our weapons, at such time as we were upon
necessity to employ them in the preservation and defense of our own person,
together withour said good subjects and servants against the rage and violence
of the said rebels whom we found inflexible to any conditions of
reconciliation, upon such motions as we had caused to be made unto them: and
again considering that albeit ourselves did know that he sought not, as they,
to assault our life and authority, yet our said good subjects might
nevertheless be greatly molested by his weapons, in case we took not from him
all occasion to employ them according as the present estate of the affairs of
this Realm did minister opportunity: and on the otherside being urged and
pressed by the cries and complaints of our provinces, molested by his
partakers, to provide some remedy, and that rather by some surcease of
hostility then otherwise, without the which their force failing for to defend
themselves, together with the means to entertain men of war, all hope of
ability to sustain their lives and families was taken from them, and some of
them constrained through the violence of the evil, had of themselves
compounded already. All these said reasons by us brought into deliberation with
the princes of our blood, the officers of our Crown and others of our
Counsel about us, among these extremities we could find no other means then
to take and yield to our said subjects some release from wars on the behalf
of the said King of Navarre. And therefore to the same effect we have granted
to him for himself and all his partakers a Truce and abstinence of war and
of all hostility, according to his request unto us made in acknowledgement of
his duty toward us, and being moved with compassion for the miseries
whereunto this realm is now brought, which moves all such as yet retain the
feeling of good Frenchmen to help to quench the fire of division that
consumes it and still threatens the utter ruin thereof, wherefro we
nevertheless hope that God of his goodness will yet preserve us to his glory
against the driftes and endeavors of those who for their private ambition do
desire and prosecute the dissipation thereof: which Truce and abstinence from
arms we mean shall be general throughout our Realm for the space of one whole
year, beginning the third of this present month and ending at the like day
including both the one and the other for all our good and faithful subjects
that acknowledge our authority, yelding us their due obedience, as also for
the state of Auignon and County of Venise appertaining to our holy Father the
Pope, whom we will to be therein comprised, and that his said subjects may
enjoy it as being under our protection: with this charge and condition besides
promised by the said king of Navarre, who has undertaken for all his
partakers, that he shall not during the said Truce employ his power or armies
in any place either within or without this Realm without our commandment or
consent: That he shall not enterprise or suffer to be enterprised or attempted
any thing in such place and places of the countries where our authority is
acknowledged. And that wheresoever he shall pass or soiourne, except in those
places which he held before the day aforesaid, he shall not change or permit
any change or alteration in matter concerning the Catholic Apostolic and
Roman Religion, neither that any harm or molestation be offered to our
Catholic subjects, Clergiemen, or others that abide faithful unto us or are
good servant, either in their persons, goods or otherwise howsoever: that if
during this war he or his do take any towns, castles, or other places by
force, surprise or intelligence, either do enter in what sort soever, he shall
immediately leave and permit them to be in our free disposition, according as he
has promised us. That in respect of the premises the said king of Navarre and
his partakers shall have the benefit of their goods, and the same to enjoy so
long as the said Truce shall continue: As also interchangeably they shall
permit the Catholics both Clergy men and others our good servant to enjoy
their goods and revenues in those places that they do hold.

We farther will and command you, that every one of you so far as it may
concern him, to observe and procure the observing of the said Truce and
abstinence of arms with all the contents above mentioned from point to point,
according to the form and tenor thereof without gainsaying or suffering any
gainsaying of the same. Also to procure these presents to be read, published
and enrolled, according as need shall require, to the end no man pretend any
cause of ignorance: By the which we protest that beside so much as concerns
the defense of our person and estat against the violence of the said rebels,
we have been also moved to make and agree to the said Truce for the benefit
that redoundeth to our Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Religion, and the
relief of our good subjects, as thereby having stopped the progress which the
king of Navarre and his partakers without this present remedy might have made
to the great detriment of our Religion, and the oppression of our said good
subjects, whilst our forces, occupied about the effect aforesaid, could not
have been opposed against him: We do moreover protest against the said rebels
for their infringing of the union of all Catholic subjects, sworn and
confirmed to us by the Deputies of our General Estates in their last assembly:
as also we urge them to reioyne themselves under our authority for the
preservation and advancement of the Catholic Apostolic and Roman
Religion, for that they only are guilty before God of all the calamity that
may ensue of the said division to the prejudice of his honor and his holy
Church, whereof the war that they make against us is the only cause.
Remaining for our own part fully resolved never to depart from any one poinct
that may appertain to the preservation and exaltation of the said Catholic
Apostolic and Roman Religion, and to persevere in this holy intent through
Gods grace, which we continually implore to our help for this effect unto the
last gasp of our life. And for as much as in many and diverse places they may
have need of these presents, we will that upon the sight thereof being duly
examined by one of our well-beloved and trusty Notaries or Secretaries, credit
be given thereto, as to this present original: For such is our pleasure.

Given at Tours the sixth and twentieth of April, in the year of grace, one
thousand five hundred four score and nine. Thus Signed.
And underneath, By the king.
And sealed upon a single lable with the great seal in yealow wax.
A DECLARATION OF THE KING OF NAVARRE, UPON THE treatise of the Truce made
between the French king, and the said L. king of Navarre.
Henry by the grace of God, King of Navarre, first Prince of the blood, chief
Peer, and protector of the reformed churches of France, etc. To all Governors
of Provinces, Captains of towns and cities, fortresses and castles,
Chieftaines and leaders of men of war, Majors, Consuls, and sworn men of
towns, Justices and officers, as well of our sovereign Lord the king, as to
all others to whom it may appertain, and that are under our authority and
protection, Greeting. Whereas it is well known to all men that we never took
or retained arms in this miserable war, but so far as necessity enforced
us: Also, that we have by our actions sufficiently testified our extreme
sorrow, seeing our selves entangled, and bound thereto through the malice of the
enemies of this Realm. On the other side, the desire that we had to be able to
serve his Majesty against them for the reestablishing of his authority, and
the rest and tranquillity of his good Subjects: yet such was the mischief,
that our good meaning was by sundry sleights disguised, and the bad minds of
the said enemies so far cloaked under beautiful and favorable pretenses,
that this Realm was brought to the point of inevitable ruin, had not the
wisdom of our said soueraign Lord the king, sundry times contraried and
crossed with infinite lets, been sufficient to discern our innocence from
among their slanders, he had not also even through their coulors and
dissimulations espied their inueterate malice: And it is most evident that this
war begun under color of religion, is even at once found to be mere war
of estate: That those of the League are not gone to seek or assail those of
the religion which we profess, but have abused both the weapons and authority
which were to that end delivered unto them, to get such towns of this realm
as were farthest of and least suspected for religion: as little also have they
employed their preachers in the conversion of those whom they did pretend to be
heretics, but contrariwise they have used them in all towns to the subversion
of this realm, as firebrandes to kindle the estate, to suborne the subjects
against their prince, to make them reject all obedience to their magistrates,
to frame them to seditions and alterations, without any respect to confound all
things both divine and human: whereby have happened to the great grief of
all good men, an incredible revolt throughout this nation against our
sovereign Lord the king, and consequently such a confusion in sundry towns
and provinces that the pretended shadow of piety and justice has quite
extinguished the body, the fear of God, the reverence of his true image, and
the lawful and sovereign Magistrate by him instituted in these extremities:
whereupon acknowledging our duty unto our said sovereign Lord the King, and
even from the bottom of our heart bewayling the calamity of this estate and
people, we have withdrawn our selves unto his Majesty, and at his feet
presented him our lives and goods to assist him against his enemies, for the
reestablishment of his authority and his good subjects. Protesting, as before
we had done, to intend to no other but his service: as also every man may judge
that if we had otherwise meant, we had fit occasion to help our selves by ye
public miseries: who did us this honor to acknowledge us and willingly to
accept of our good wills: also to ye end to give us better means to serve him,
he resolved upon a Truce or abstinence of war with all hostility, whereof we
hope through Gods help, of a good peace to ensue. Therefore that we give you
to wit, and to all and every of you which acknowledge our authority and
protection, and that have and do follow that part which we uphold, every one
for himself, that we have treated, decreed and concluded with our sovereign
Lord the King, upon a truce or abstinence general from arms throughout this
land for one whole year, to begin the third day of April, and to end upon the
like day, as well the one as the other therein concluded. Wherein also our
meaning is to comprise the state and County of Venise with the subjects
thereof as being under the protection of our said sovereign Lord the King: and
so consequently we do forbid all persons of whatsoever estate or calling, not
to attempt or enterprise against those places where his Majesty's authority is
acknowledged, neither against the said state or County of Venise, or in any
other place or places where we shall enter, pass by, or soiourne, expressly
commanding that there be nothing enterprized against his good and loyal
subjects, no not against ye Clergy, neither to innouate or interrupt any thing
concerning the Catholic Roman religion, as also in case by Gods grace we
enter whether by surprise, force or otherwise into any hold or town occupied
by the enemies, our meaning is there shall be no alteration in the service or
other matter belonging to the said Catholic Roman religion, according as more
at large have by us been concluded with our sovereign Lord the King. Also
whereas in consequence of the premises it has pleased his Majesty to grant
and yield a general enioyment of their goods, and to all those of the religion
which we do profess and others of this party, to enjoy the same during this
present truce, our intent reciprocally is that al his good subjects as well of
the Clergy, as other shall enjoy their goods and revenues during the same in
those places that we do hold, whereof besides these presents we will dispatch
them all letters necessary.

Moreover we command you and every of you so far as to him appertains, to
cause these presents to be read, published, enrolled, kept and observed in
every point according to their form and tenure, ceasing and causing to cease
al troubles and impeachments to the contrary. In witness whereof we have
caused these Presents, signed with our own hand, to be sealed with our Seal
of arms. Given at Saulmur this 24. of April in the year of grace. 1589.

Thus signed.
And underneath,
And sealed upon a single lable with the said Lords great seal in red wax.
THE KING OF NAVARRES DECLARATION AT THE PASSAGE OF THE RIVER of Loire for the
service of his Majesty the 18. of April. 1589.
HEnry by the grace of God king of Navarre, etc. To all those to whom these
presents shall come, greeting. As it has pleased God to cause us to be borne
first Prince of the blood, and chief Peer of France: whom nature has taught
to defend his king, law and duty do bind to maintain the Estate of this
Realm: and that it may be apparent by the effects known to every one, that the
disturbers whatsoever pretense they take, shot at no other thing but his
Majesty's life and Crown, neither purpose any other then the dissipation and
usurping of this Estate, whereof can ensue no other then the confusion of all
things both divine and humane, the extinguishing of all order policy and
justice, and the utter ruin of each one in particular and of all the good
subjects of this Realm in general, even such as every one does foresee and in
heart bewail, yea and the most part do in effect already feel it in their
goods, lives, honors and liberties.

For this cause, we being called of God, nature and law, to so necessary a
work, have resolved with our selves to employ our lives, goods and abilities
upon the restablishment of the king our sovereign Lords authority, the
restoration of this Realm, the preservation and deliverance (so far as in
us may lie) of all the good subjects of the same against those who so openly
have attempted against the person of his Majesty, and dared to enterprise the
usurpation of his Realm, and brought almost to the point of inevitable ruin
so many poor people, which God of his grace has united and preserved in so
many ages under the sacred and inviolable laws of this Realm.

We declare that we have not, neither will hold for enemies any other then
those who by their effects have proclaimed and openly declared themselves
enemies to this Realm: who have so much as in them lies, extinguished and
blotted out the name of the king, of the sovereign Magistrate given us of God,
heretofore sacred to our nation, disgraded his Parliaments and sovereign
Courts, so far forth as to have cruelly slain the principal personages,
against whose dignity and life, whether for their Estate, or for their
deserts, no thieves or barbarous people or utter enemies to mankind would have
enterprised: to have broken and defaced the seals of the Realm, the sacred
instruments of sovereign justice, violating and profaning, so far as they
might, even justice it self: and to be brief, so co^founding all things that
wheresoever their power takes place there rests nothing but sack, blood,
fury and insolency, desolation among the people, carcases in the towns,
mourning and lamentation in all families, and combustion and universal horror
among all sorts. Against these persons do we oppose our just weapons: against
these do woe denounce war with all rigor, and against these do we inuit and
adjure all good Frenchmen the kings faithful servant, lovers of their
country and defenders of the good laws thereof to assist us with their vows,
weapons and wealth: as being resolved and assured that GOD will bless us and
give us grace under the kings authority to chastise them according to their
desert, and that he will no longer suffer so many mischiefs unpunished,
mischiefs committed under a false semblant of goodness, sacriledges and
impieties under the sacred names of piety and justice. Nevertheless in as
much as we are not ignorant, but that many may have been entangled in these
enormities, some being transported by fury, others overcome by a just fear,
and the most part rather suborned by subtletie, then lead by their own
malice: as also we can not thinck that France is so degenerated as
maliciously of set purpose to renounce her fidelity and loyalty to her
natural Prince, that is to say, to the inheritance and patrimony of her
fathers.

We, upon a desire to separate, so far as lies in us, the innocent from the
guilty, and with all discretion to use the just sword that God has put into
our hand for the service of our sovereign Lord the king, and the preservation
of his subjects, do signify to all Provinces, towns, communalties, clergy
men, nobility, and men of law, captains of men of war, citizens, burgesses,
and all other persons of whatsoever condition, estate, or calling, that with
all speed they retire from all communication and fellowship with the said
enemies, disturbers of this estate, and reunite themselves under his Majesty's
obedience, giving him assurance of their fidelity and service. In so doing, as
also being by them duly certified, we will carefully preserve them according
to such order as we have from him, and do desire to employ under his
commandments: otherwise, in case they show themselves either obstinate or
careless, we denounce against them all the mischief that may incur by the
rigor of arms, as worthy to participate in the just punishments of those, to
whose injustice and violence they shall minister either consent or countenance.
We do consequently entend to preserve and maintain all the good subjects and
servants of our sovereign Lord the king: also, those that shall (as is
aforesaid, reunite themselves unto him) in their goods, lives, honors,
liberties, religion and consciences, without exception or acception whatsoever:
especially those of the Clergy, of whom we will the rather take care, because
they are more commonly opposed to the extremity of war. Provided also, that
for their parts they remember to love peace, and modestly to conteyne
themselves within their bounds, whereas some of them, to the great reproach of
their vocation, are become the instruments of these disorders.

We do expressly forbid all our men of war, and other our adherents in this
our pursuit, not to attempt or enterprise any thing against the kings said
good subjects and servants, and others to him reconciled as aforesaid of
whatsoever state or condition: namely against the said clergimen, or the places
appointed to the use of their ecclesiastical service, wherein we will not that
they be any whit molested, under pain to the infringers of these Presents, of
punishment and correction according to the exigence of the case and the rigor
of our martial laws. As also, we do most straightly command our lieutenants
general, governors, officers of our army, heads and captains, and all other
persons of command, diligently to set to their hands every one in his calling:
under pain to the said heads and captains, through whose negligence or
winking at causes any mishap may fall, to answer therefore in their own names
and persons. Nevertheless, admonishing the said good subjects and servants of
the king our sovereign Lord, of all degrees and callings, and all that are to
him reconciled as is aforesaid, to help to distinguish the good from the bad,
and to prevent the inconuenie^ces which may more easily be stopped then
amended, also in time to retire to us, and to our said lieutenants, governors
and officers, to the end to be furnished of pasports, warrants, and necessary
dispatches: intending nevertheless, that our sovereign Lord the Kings
warrants, made since the date of these presents, shall be inuiolably kept and
observed, under pain of rigorous punishment to the breakers of the same.

We do here beseech all states and degrees of this Realm to set before their
eyes the dommage that has and consequently will more and more ensue in every
of them by their confusions. The Clergy to consider how piety is stifled
among weapons, Gods name blasphemed, and Religion contemned, every one
practicing to play with the sacred name of faith, when they see the greatest
take it for a pretense to shadow the most execrable infidelity that may be.
The Nobility to note what a fall their order has lately had, when arms,
either the badges of hereditary Nobility or the rewards of virtue, are as it
were trailed through the mire, committed to a communalties hands, who from
liberty will pass to license, and from license will give themselves over to
all insolency, without further respect (as has been seen already) of desert
or calling. The Magistrates, what theeuery is crept in at the gate of common
weal, when in the chamber of the Peers of this Realm, where the greatest upon
reverence to justice, do leave of their swords, an Attorney shall enter in
arms accompanied with twenty rascals and carry his sword to the throat of the
Parliament of France, and in triumph lead it away in red robes to the Bastille:
when a chief President shall be murdered, trailed about, and hanged at Tholouze
(one that was a zealous follower of his Religion, if ever there were any, and
the most formal enemy of the contrary) by the conspiracy of a Bishop: and
with what show of heresy? Oh monsters of fury, cruelty and barbarousnesse,
who nevertheless can not live long, unless peradventure by some shameful
memory to this world and to the nation that has borne and does support them,
detestable wheresoever it comes to the posterity. The third Estate, who at
the least were to take profit of these domages, let them look whether they be
eased of their taxes and subsidies, whether they be discharged of the men of
war, whether their shoppes in the towns, or their farms in the country be
in better case, whether the treasury be better husbanded then aforetime: nay
contrariwise whether deuourings be not doubted, whether the grass grows not
before their gates, whether for one hand that was wont to grope in ye treasury
there be not three: whether it that they call husba^ding be not the sacking of
good houses given to porters, and the ransoming of good men that groan under
these disorders: A matter that can not continue many days, which expired, the
communaltie being fleshed in the spoil of those whom they term Politics, as
wolves upon carrion, and their booties failing them, will cruelly and without
respect fall upon all that be of any countenance. Let those towns that have
taken their part remember in what state they were before, and in what they be
now: The traffic (who so list to seek it) in the midst of a forest? Justice,
in ye dungeo^s of the Bastill? Learning, where barbarousnesse possesses all?
yet be these the means that have brought them to so great glory and wealth:
yea even the means that only could therein enterteine them: At this day it is
heresy to be a Politic: but the policy that had brought them to their
flower is run to contempt: Shortly it will be an unpardonable trespass to be
rich. Moreover if they have any garrison their liberty perishes, and the
lickerousnesse of this word has made them lose it: If they have no garrison,
then are they a pray, oppressed with gardes and badly kept, at every moment in
danger of surprise: and thus behold an imaginary liberty in stead of a
prison. Neither shall the fields have any better bargain, if this mischief
continue. A king cannot abide to be disgraded by his subjects: Rigor must be
set against rigor, and force against force: The licentiousness, excess and
disorders of these perturbers will draw on others: Against the usurpation of a
stranger his Majesty must be succored by strangers: against the Spaniardes
drifts with Suitzers and Germans: our fields shall become forests, and our
wars young springs, a disease common to the laborer and the burgess, to the
Gentleman and the Clergy: a disease that will multiply robberies in the
fields and rages in the towns: then woe to the auctors and favorers of these
miseries: the people will convert this fury against them, and with their blood
will redeem their abolition, their own peace and life, and to their costs
they shall see what it is to wrest the scepter from the sovereign, and the
sword from the Magistrate therewith to arm and authorize the licentiousness
of the people.

Mark their imaginations, after they have plucked the king out of his throne,
they have left the place empty: ask then whom in conscience they will place
therein: the Duke of Mayenne? What prince is there in Christendom that will
not withstand it? that knows not himself to be hurt in this example? Of our
nobility, how many families be there that will not obey the house of Lorraine?
much less the varlet of varlets? ye houses honored with the alliance of our
kings and princes about us, who also have this article above the rest. That
they are borne French and have perseuered in their birth, what a heart breaking
will it be for such to stoop under so weak a yooke? to see their lives and
honors at the discretion of these vpstarts? whom nature has made their
equals, whose sword the law of the Realm has measured with the same foot,
whom God has no way preferred before them save only in that he has given
them over to their own presumption. How many princes of the house of Bourbon
must they pierce before they come there? Princes I say armed with right, with
courage and with credit against this imaginatiue Chimere of usurpation, for
whose blood the nobility will hazard theirs: the Nobility which in like
alterations finds it self still buried with the Monarchy: Nobility, whose
honor and degree is tied to that of our kings: Nobility which to be brief can
not hope to keep that degree over the commons which God has given it, when it
shall see their sovereign, him of who^ it holds the sword cast headlong from
his. Let every man hold his peace: let us suffer them at leisure to do what
they list. If they will ground their usurpation upon Charlemains prete^ses, how
will they agree with the Duke of Lorraine and his children? how? albeit they
will agree with the branch of Vaudemont? Again if they think the crown due
to the deserts, to the labors and to the virtues, that is to say, to the late
Duke of Guises Monopoles, how can they frustrate his heir? but who doubts
that all the varlets of the house pretend not a share, that is, that they are
not resolved to rent asunder the state and to share out the pieces?

O Frenchmen, imagine what your estate shall then be. These chaunges out of one
extremity into an other are never made without a most violent overthrow: the
house wherein we are now lodged cannot be overthrown but we shall be oppressed
therein. Our bodies turn not to worms and serpents before death catches
hold: these serpents can not be borne, neither proceed out of the body of this
estate before it be dissolved, perished and rotten, and that we all which do
not live, other then in it, must run to ruin. It is very easy to desire a
crown: it is very easy for a people moved and passionate against their
Prince, to think upon the alteration of the Estate. Between an ambitious
desire and the accomplishment thereof, between your hasty chollers, and your
reuenges so far of, how many days works and battles? what plenty of blood,
sack and misery? the ages of the world will not suffice to decide this
quarrel: the son will take the fathers place, and the brother the brothers:
you shall make a perpetual confusion to the posterity which shall curse the
memory of your madness.

And how much more convenient for you were it to abridge so many calamities
with a peace? a peace which out of the dark Chaos wherein you have plunged
your selves, might reduce you into the light, which might restore you to your
selves, to your nature and to your senses, which might deliver you out of these
disquietnesses wherein you are, from this labyrinth wherinto you are entered,
which you do well deem you can not get out of, and whereof in the mean while
you see not the end: a peace which might replant every one in that he loves:
might restore to ye husbandma^ his plough, to the artificer his shop, to the
merchant his traffic, to the country assurance, to the towns government, and
to all men indifferently upright justice: a peace that might return you the
kings fatherly love, to him the obedience and fidelity that you owe him: to be
brief, a peace that might render to this estate both soul and body: the body
which through these ambitious is haled in a thousand pieces: the soul, I mean
the good order that has preserved it, which from the highest degree to the
lowest runs all to confusion.

These things considered, every one sounding the very bottom, whether it be
the evil that he does himself, or that he is to suffer: in these confusions we
assure our selves that they who hitherto have persisted in their duties to his
Majesty, will double their affections and courage to serve him from good to
better against his enemies: that they who under simplicity have let themselves
run into their practices, would not be instruments of their own destruction,
by undermining the foundation of this estate to pull it upon their own heads,
but will rather abandon so bad a faction, and have recourse to his Majesty's
clemency, who still keeps the gate open to all that seek it.

As for such as obstinately shall persist enemies to the king, to this Realm
and to their own good, as they shall most justly purchase Gods wrath and the
hatred of man, so are they to expect no other but a fearful judgment from
above worthy their merits, which God for his mercy hasten upon the obstinate,
to the abridging of so many mischiefs and miseries, and to the weal, peace,
and quiet of so many poor people.

In respect of our self, we protest that ambition armeth us not: sufficiently
have we showed that we do despise it, and it is honor enough to us to be that
we are, neither can ye honor of this Estate perish but we must decay. And so
little, (God is our witness) are we lead by revenge that none has received
more wrongs and injuries the^ we, neither has any hitherto made less
pursuit: neither shall any be more liberal to forgive the enemies, if they
amend, in any case that may concern the tranquilite and peace of France. That
which afflicts us, which we can neither see nor foresee without tears, is
that this Estate shall be brought to that point that its harm is so grown and
stubburne, that it can not be helped without great mischief.

From these mischiefs do we protest against the wound and those that made it:
he that made the wound is guilty of the fire, the corosiue, the incisions, and
the griefs that necessarily they make. It suffices, and every one may see
it, that in that little which we may, we bring the care of the good surgeon
that loves the patient. The enemies in deed that love the disease, will,
besides the iron, bring both hatred and fraud, as they that ca^ have no
contentatio^ but in their ambition over this estate, neither can they content
thmselues but in her sinall death, a death which we will redeem with the price
of our life and all our goods. But rather (as we trust in God the preserver of
kings and kingdoms) we shall shortly as the fruit of our labors, see the king
in his due authority, whereto he is borne, and the Realm in like force and
dignity as heretofore, to the contentment of all good Frenchmen, the comfort
of such numbers of poor people, and the heart breaking of such as do covet the
ruin thereof.

We do therefore beseech the Lords of the Courts of Parliament, all
governors, lieutenants general of the provinces, chambers of accounts, courts
of aides, treasourers general of France, prouostes, bailiffes, seneschalles,
judges, majors, sheriffs, iurats, consuls, headboroughs, bodies and
communalties of towns, and all other justices and officers my Lord the Kings
subjects, to assist, favor, and lean unto us, for the benefit of his
affairs and service: For such is our desire.

Given at Saulmur, the eighteenth of April, 1589. Thus signed HENRY.
By the king of Navarre, first Prince of the blood, and chief Peer of
France.

FINIS.
