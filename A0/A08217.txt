The First Chapter.
There is demanded / How-men shall discerne^ or know distinctlie; the Perfect
/ from out of the Vnperfect^ and the Service of the Perfection / from out of
the Service of the Vnperfection. And thereunto is answered by HN, like-a^
heer-after follows.

Understand the 1. Cor. 13. c.
Perfect and of the Vnperfect^ and the Diversity of ether-others Service /
well and rightly: A Man which has wholly adjoined and geeuen-ouer himself /
with all that which is under his Might reversed;as a faithful Disciple; to the
gracious Word and his Service of Love / and to the Elders of the holy
Understanding in the same Word / for to be obedient thereunto: and euenso
reversed;in the Math. 19. d. Mark. 8. Luke 14.
Forsaking of himself and of all that which he has take^-on and appropriated
unto him; proceedeth-forward and groweth-vp therein obedientlie / till unto the
Perfection: and that also the Imperfect reversed;or That which is in part; 1.
Cor. 13. b.
ceasseth with him / and so is become of-one-beeing / with the Love and her
holy Spirit / Such-a-one is then taught / with the serviceable Word and
through the serviceable Word of the holy Spirit of Love / to Math. 13. g.
the Kingdom of the God of Heaven: and is euenso led or brought unto the
everlasting Perfection / unto the Kingdom of the God of Heaven the perfect
Beauty / and unto the everlasting Life / the upright Righteousness and Holiness.

2. When now then the obedient and believing Man reversed;through the
serviceable Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Love; is comprehended of the
Perfect^ well exercised in the Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Loue^
growen-vp to the Elderdom of the godly Vndersta^ding^ and taught to the
Kingdom of Heaven / So becomes then the same Man reversed;according to his
Elderdom in the godly Understanding; ordained to a Fellow-minister of the
Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Love / seeing that the godly Testimonies
have reversed;at that time; rightly John. 7. e.
their Outflowing / from the inward Body of the same Man / to the
seruiceablenes of Other-moe which are yeat imperfect.

1. Cor. 1^.
imperfect / by ye Vnperfectons / Because there is a greater and perfecter
Being / taught and required or diligently laboured-for with the same / then
there is by the Vnperfectons / among whom the foresaid Testimonies are
ministered: namely / the John. 3. a.
new Birth in the godly Love. Which Love is Col. 3. b.
the Perfection itself.

4. Eauen-thus have the Services of the Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Love
/ their Ministration among the Vnperfectons: and do remove Ephe. 2. c.
the Middelwall / which is betwixt the Perfect and the Vnperfectons: and make
euenso of Twain / that it be One. namelye / God and the Man / in one true
perfect Being of Jesus Christ.

5. And till unto the same Perfection / the Services are reversed;by the
Vnperfectons; also imperfect. But by Those / to whom the Perfection comes / in
their Belief and Obedience of the Word / the 1. Cor. 13. b.
Imperfect ceasseth. For the Perfect is than / by the Perfectons / a living
Fountain / wherout the Waters of Life do flow / and geeue euenso their
Refreashing reversed;to the Releeuing of the thirsty Souls after the
Righteousness; out of the Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Love. And the
refreashed Parts / assemble them to that one inseparable John. 4. b.
Fountain / full of all living Waters / which flow into the everlasting Life.

6. This living Fountain / full of living Waters

7. And the perfect Man reversed;whereof we speak; and which is of-one-beeing
with the true Perfection / cannot geeue-fourth els-what from him / but all
humble and meek Virtues and Righteousnesses / which flow out of the
Perfection. And the same Outflowinges / are eauen as Esa. 55. b. John. 7. c.
a Water-streame / that flowe^h out of a Fountain / like as the Fountain
geeueth it fourth.

8. Howbeit / the Water which is so flowen-abrode / is not the Fountain
itself: but it is an outflowen Water / which divides itself out of ye
Fountain: Semblable-wise / so is not that any Perfection / which reversed;to
an Instruction and Reformation of the Life; flows out of ye Perfectons. For
all that which a perfect godded Man speaks, witnesses, and teaches / among
the Disciples and Believers of the Word / are all foregoinge Services and
Distributions / proceeding out of the Perfect / wherwithall the upright Ephe.
4. c.
Righteousness and Holiness of the Perfection / is expressed and held-fourth
before the Disciples and Believers of the Word / for to lead them euenso
reversed;through the serviceable Word; to the Perfection / whereof there is
spoken / and whereunto there is poynted in the Knowledge / till unto the Coming of
his Appeering.

Paul has witnessed / where he says: Our Knowledge 1. Cor. 13. b.
is imperfect reversed;or as a Peece-woorke;: as also our Prophesying. But when
that which is Perfect / is com / then shall that which is Imperfect / cease.

10. Thereof speaks also Saint Peter: We have a 2. Pet. 1. d.
sure prophetical Word / and ye do well / in that ye have a regard on
the same / as on a Light which shyneth in a dark Corner / till that the Day be
com / and that the Morning-dawne arise in your Hearts.

11. In such-sort as a foregoing Light of the sure prophetical Word / is
also ye serviceable Word of the holy Spirit of Love / wherewith the Perfection
is witnessed and expressed: and thatsame Perfection / becomes also seen or
perceived reversed;as in a Glass; in the serviceable 1. Cor. 13. b. 2. Cor. 3.
b. Iam. 1. c.
Word of the holy Spirit of Love. But in the Appeering of his Coming / in
godly Cleernes / it becomes seen of Those to whom the same appears
reversed;in his godly Cleernes; from 1. Cor. 13. b.
Face to Face. That is / out of our codeified Mind / into the Mind of the
living Godhead. And That is the true Perfection / which becomes seen and
known in the Perfection of our inward Manhod / and wherthrough the Love is
made-manifest / and also lived among Men.

The Second Chapter.
There is demanded / How the Children of Love or of God^ do behave themselves /
and what-maner of Disposition and Nature then are of. And thereunto is answered
by HN / this Resolution heere-following.

AS touching this Matier / there is Leuit. 1^. Deuteronomy. 6. Mark. 12. Luke 10. Romans
13.
Scripture / and it is also cleerlie testified / in the serviceable Word 4.
Spe. ^2.
of the holy Spirit of Love / that the true Children of God / have a good
Disposition and Nature: and that they keep themselves always therein /
vprightlie, graciously, and peaceably / both before God and Man: and that
they also are altogether inclyned reversed;before God / and toward Men; for
to walk in all Love / and to shewfourth all Seruiceablenes / under the
Obedience of the Love: and euenso to cover with the Love / the Iam. 5. c. 1.
Pet. 4. a.
Sins of their Neighbor / and to inlardge the Love reversed;to all Edifying
and Peace; in her Service: For they are / even from the Youth up of their new
Birth / exercised in all Weldooing and Love. for that cause also / they cannot
bring-fourth any-thing-els / but all Good and Love.

2. For the true holy Spirit of Love reversed;wherwithall they are sealed;
leads them into all John. 13. 14. 16. 1. John. 3.
Truth of the upright Life: and manifests euenso in them / the upright
Woo^^es of Love. And they 2. Cor. 4. b.
bear the same cosilie Treasure in earthen Vessels / to the Land and Honor of
the almighty God: and are euenso of-one-minde with the three godly Witnesses
/ that beare-witnes in Heaven.

John. 4.
Witnesses / the one is the Love / which is God the Father himself. The second
Witness / is the John. 14. 17.
Truth / which is the Word of God the Father / and JESUS CHRIST himself. And
the third Witness / is the holy Spirit of Love or of God / and of the Truth of
Jesus Christ, which is the everlasting Life / and the Inheritance of all
spiritual and heavenly Goods.

4. And thatsame everlasting Life / together with the spiritual and heavenly
Goods / and everlasting Joy / becomes revealed and brought unto Them that are
borne out of God / in the heavenly Being: and therthrough / they have their
fellowship with God / the Father / with his Son / the Lord Jesus Christ, and
with the Holie-gost of Love / wherout they witness and declare / the great Act.
2.
Acts of God / and the Salvation of all Men.

5. Those now that know thissame / and receive it in the heavenly Being /
their Testimonies are true. For they witness That / which they have seen in the
Godhead / and 1. John. 1.
heard in the Heaven. And That is the holy Spirit which witnesses with them:
for the perfect Godhead / lives and dwells in them.

6. For-that-cause also / the Children of Love or 1. Cor. 3. b. 2. Cor. 6. c.
Heb. 3. a.
Temple of the living God / wherein God with his Christ and holy Spirit /
dwells: and wherthrough they express their good Nature and Being / among
all Men / even as there is said. And in such-sort / the living God is their God
/ and They his Apo. 21. a.
elected People: in whose Temple / there is no Idol / but alone the living God
of Israel: nether is-ther also any Idolatry-seruice ministered theare. but alone
the Ministration of Jesus Christ / with the spiritual heavenly Goods of his
holy Spirit of Love.

The Third Chapter.
A distinct Declaration / how that He which believes in Christ / has the
everlasting life.

Christ, but Such with whom Christ is remaining or present / or which assemble
them to Him and his Doctrine / in his Name / and so become his Disciples.
(Therefore is all the Faith / that Men reversed;without the Assembling unto
Jesus Christ and his Doctrine; assume or take-on of Christ reversed;whether it
be then out of the Imagination of the Knowledge^ out of the Goodthinking of the
Heart^ or out of the Text or Letter; no Faith in Jesus Christ / that extends
to the Inheritance of Christ / in the eternal Life.) Nether-yet is-ther also
anyman / that preaches or teaches the Word or the Doctrine of Christ, but
Such as have first ben obedient Disciples of the Word and of the Doctrine of
Jesus Christ. and euenso reversed;under the Obedience of the Love of Christ; are
Math. 13. g.
taught to the Kingdom of Heaven: and in whom Christ Gal. 4. c.
has then likewise his Shape.

2. For that cause / they all which have not rightly believed in Jesus Christ /
have missed the eternal Life / as also the living Waters / whereof the
Scripture maketh-mention / touching the Believers in Christ, like-as there
stands written: Whosoever John. 7. c.
believes in Me (says CHRIST) as the Scripture says / from his Body shall
flow Rivers of living Water. Which living Waters / serve to the Purging Ezec.
36. c.
of y^ Heart or inward Mind / the which the vnilluminated Scripture-learned
and unsent Preachers / have never out of the Letter reversed;albeit that they
testified the same / and administered it / according to their Goodthinking;
obtained or could attain unto. For inasmuch as they turned them not about to
the Math. 18.
childish Simplicity / so has also the 4. Esdr. 1. c.
wicked Nature that Contrary-minde to God remained ever with them.

3. But the Word of the upright Doctrine of Jesus Christ / that seruiceablie is
administered reversed;speakablie or in Letters; out of the Love / and out of the
Light of Life / is truly the upright and safe-making Water or Doctrine / to
the Purging of the believing and obedient Hearts of the same Word: For Christ
the Savior / is present in the same Service.

4. For-that-cause the same serviceable Word reversed;which is administered
speakablie or in Letters / out of the Love and out of y^ true Light and
everlasting Life; is also 2. Cor. 5. d.
Christ after y^ Fleash: and so Many as believe the same Word / and assemble
them obedientlie thereunto / have their communion with Christ after the Fleash.

5. For euenso / among the Believers of the Word / the Word became Fleash /
and John. 1. b.
dwelled among them: and Jesus Christ was also in such-sort borne unto them of
the Virgin Marie / out of the Romans 1. ^. 2. Tim. 2. b.
Seed of David after the Fleash [that is / of the pure Doctrine / out of the
Seed of the Love. which bears euenso without woo or greef:] And whosoever
then receaueth or feedeth-of the outflowen Word and his Life
reversed;beleeuinglie; in his Soul / He John. 6.
eats truly the Fleash of Christ, and drinks his Blood: and is raysed-vp
by Christ / in the last Day / to the eternal Life: and becomes euenso in his
new Birth / consubstanciated with Christ after the Spirit. And Those that John.
3. c. 6. f
believe euen-so in Christ / have the eternal Life.

Christ, and become Romans 6.
implanted into Him / so feel we then also most-trulie / that Christ the
Word of Life 1. Pet. 2. d.
bears in us our Sins / and suffers for our Sins cause: wherthrough we
also are inclyned for to suffer with Him / and reversed;to the Romans 6. a. Col.
2. b.
Burying of our Sins; to follow-after Him / even unto his Buryall: and so we
become Part-takers of the Passion of Christ, as also after the same / of his
Phil. 3. b.
Resurrection and everlasting Life.

7. In such-sort verelie / we know or understand in the Belief and Obedience
of the Word / how that the Word or Christ / John. 1. c.
bears our Sins / together with all our Frailty and Ignorance: and how
that likewise for that cause / the Elders in the same Word / take-vpp in Grace
or Mercy / all the Sins / Weakness / and Ignorance of the Believers of the
Word / and cover the same with their Love / under the Obedience of the same
Word and his Doctrine. For in such-sort do the Elders and Ministers of the
Word reversed;in their Service prepare and kindle the trespass Ier. 33. ^.
Offeri^g of the Believers of the Word / on the Altar in the Holy of Christ
reversed;either Belief of the Word; to a Burnt-offering of a sweet Savor /
before the Lord.

8. And the Accomplishing of the same Offering / is the Puri^ying of our Hearts
/ from all sinful Being. And thatsame is the true Gods-seruice in the Spirit
/ wherein we 1. Pet. 2. 4. ^.
followe-after Christ in the like Passion Romans 6. a.
or Death of his Cross [that is / in his like Contempt or Dispising] the which
is the true Furnace of Humiliation / wherthrough our Sins are
consumed-to-nothing.

9. When now the Service of the Word and Christ; his full Course with us / so
departs then the 2. Cor. 3. d. Heb. 10. d.
Veil reversed;which is the Fleash of Christ; from our Hearts: and Christ
after the Spirit / comes unto us in Glory: And He is reversed;even as the
right High Priest; a Heb. 3. 4. 7.
Minister of the spiritual and heavenly Goods / in us: and we inherit euenso
all thosesame / through Jesus Christ after the Spirit.

10. But till unto the same Time of the Coming of Christ after the Spirit / in
his Glory / so is unto us Christ after the Fleash / a Minister of the
Circumcision reversed;that is / in the Laying-away of the Sin; for Gods
Trueth-his cause / and for to establish Romans 15. b.
the Promises made to the Fathers / and so to procreate in us reversed;out of
the Belief; the euerlas^ing and true Heir / in the Establishing of the
Promises of God the Father: and also-for that the Seruantship of the Law /
should be no Gal. 3. c.
Heir with the Believers.

11. And That was the Complaint of Abraham, which he reversed;ereuer he had a
Son or an Heir; complained before the Lord / that he had obtained no Genesis
15. a.
Seed out of the Belief / and supposed euenso / that his Servant [that is /
the Seruantship out of the Lawe] should be his Heir. But the Lord said unto
him: Not so / thy Servant shall not be thine Heir. but the Son which shall
be borne out of thee: That is / out of the Faith of Abraham.

^al. 4. a.
young / or first newborn by the Believers of the Word / and that also the
Believers are yeat young or small in the heavenly Understanding / by Him: and
euenso reversed;as goodwilling Servants to the Obedience of their Lord; have
a Lust reversed;according to the Requiring of the serviceable Word; to do the
Will of the Lord / So is-ther not any difference made / betwixt the Heir and
the Servant: but they stand both-alike under the Services of the gracious
Word of y^ Lord reversed;as under Tutours; till unto the Gal. 4. ^.
appointed Time of the Father. In such like-sort is it also with all them /
which believe the gracious Word in his Service of Love / and have a Lust
reversed;according to the Requiring of the serviceable Word; to do the
Lord-his Will. For as long as the Believers of the Word / are yeat young or
childish in the Procreation of the Seed of the Promise / that becomes borne
in them / out of the Belief of the Word: and are not yeat growen-vpp to the
Ephe. 4. b.
^lderdom of the perfect Being of the Word [which is the appointed Gal. 4. a.
Time of the Father / over all Believers of the Woord] so stand they yeat
(although they believe) under the Ordinance of the Lord or his Word. Not
therefore that they should always remain / as subject thervnder. but unto the
appointed Time / to-wit / til-vnto the manly Olde-aige in the godly
Understanding of y^ holy Word / as there is said: That is / till that the
Sins be subdued. and that they euenso reversed;through the Law; be Romans 7.
^. Gal. 2. d.
dead unto the Lawe^ and taught to the Kingdom of Heaven / and have attained
reversed;in the Life of the Word; to the appointed Time of the Eph^. 4. b.
manly Olde-aige.

13. And euenso on the Promise of y^ everlasting Life reversed;out of the
Ministration of the holy and gracious Word under the Obedience of the Love;
may well all the Believers of y^ Word reversed;with Joy / in the Hope of the
everlasting Life; geeue-ouer themselves wholly in the Romans ^.
Death of Christ: and so let themselves be baptized or washed reversed;with
the outflowing safe-making Waters of Christ; in the Death of Christ: For euenso
reversed;in the same Death; the Sin ceasseth: and to become borne-anew therout
/ all upright Believers receive reversed;in the Faith of Christ; the
everlasting Life. It is very-true.

The IIII. Chapter.
In this Chapter reversed;which depends on the former; does HN testify /
that every Believer of the Word / shall shewefourth the Love toward his
Neighbor / when he transgresses or ouerreacheth himself in anything /
wherthorough he staggereth and falls: and that they shall not wax-offended
one at another / nether ^et have any euel Conceauing toward each-other.

Math. 7. b.
small Way / wher-thorowe ye ought to go unto the Life / or are deptours for
to passe-thorowe the same / So could ye not then verelie but be moved with
great compassion toward your Neighbor / which falls into any Sin / and
not reversed;in anye-case; wax-offended at his Fall / nor at his Frailty: but
Romans 15. a. Gal. 6. a. 1. Tess. 5. b.
bear and haue-sufferaunce with him / and infourme him with all Love and
Discreetnes: like-as if ye saw any-man fall into the Water / and had such
Compassion and Love toward him / that ye would rather fall therein with him
eauen up to the Throat reversed;for to help him therout; then that ye should
let him perrish. For euenso reversed;to the Preservation of your Neighbor;
ought also all your Love / to be toward your Neighbor: and so to infourme
each-other / with Discreetnes / and not to take-^ffence one at an-other of you
/ much-lesse to blame one-another / or yet to bear Hate or Envy / or any
Euel-conceauing toward anyman / either yet to vpbraide him with his Sins /
or to construe them to the worst / either to speak of them behind him: but to
lay it all down under the Love / and to cover it with y^ Love: For the Love
reversed;doubtless; Pro. 10. b. 1. Pet. 4. b. Iam. 5. c.
covers the Multitude of Sins.

2. Behold / with such Grace and Discreet-dealing / or with such a beneuolent
Heart of Love reversed;to your Preservation / in the Belief of the Word / and
to the Covering of your Sins; are ye all presently reversed;with the
gracious Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Love; infourmed by the Lord / and
by the Ministers of his Word / and also loved to the Righteousness of the Life.

3. Seeing then that ye are loved and infourmed Romans 2. a.
blame nor to slander him / nor yet to spread-fourth his Sins among
each-other / much-les then among y^ Strangers: but to cover always y^ Faults
and Weakness of your Neighbor / so much as ye are able. Yet notwithstanding /
let eueryone Pro. 28. b. Eccli. 4. 17.
confess his Sins reversed;wherein he falls; before his Elder in the holy
Understanding / and make-manifest before him / all his Dealing and
Conversation: and also that the-one do exhort the-other thereunto.

4. If ye now see or perceive / that your Neighbor has Gal. 6. a.
don-amisse in any-maner of thing: or that he is heerin or therein
reversed;touching that which concerns the outward or inward Righteousness;
weak or infirm / and so sins against any Righteousness: and that the same
might be to his Destruction / or to an Estraunging from the Service of Love
and his Concord / So shall ye then warn him thereof in stilnes / and with the
Leui. 19. b. Eccli. 19. b. Math. 18. b. 1. Pet. 4. b.
Love reversed;wherewith the Lord and his Ministers love you; cover his Sins
/ and Ephe. 4. b.
show Mercy toward him: and that altogether / to Concord and Love among
each-other.

5. And euen-thus after such a Patron or Example / shall ye have your
conversation in ye Love / with each-other / unto Godlynes: and all the Love and
Goodness which ye would should Leuit. 19. Romans 13.
chance / or be showed unto you by your Neighbor / that shall ye likewise
show always toward your Neighbor.

Jesus Christ / use among each-other. For the 2. Pet. 1. a.
Love deals in such-sort with them: and euenso deal also the Elders in their
Service / with the Communialtie of the Famelie of the Love of Jesus Christ. For
if the Elders in the Service of the Love of Jesus Christ / chance to perceive
by anyone of the Communialtie / that he enterprised anything / whereby he
might be in danger of his Destruction / or which might happily cause him to
be estraunged from the Way to the good Life / so are they then very sorrowful
for such-aone / and seek or use reversed;through the Testimonies of the holy
Spirit of Love; all-maner of Means / wherewith they might so prevent and
infourme him / that he may be preserved from his Destruction: and they
admonish him so lovely and discreetlie as they are able / or so much as is
necessary for him thereunto.

7. For they see and perceive / that if they should let him runne-fourth therein
without any warning / and not assist him with reached fourth-hand / that great
Infelicitie and Misery might then light-vpon him^ and the terrible
condemnable Being catch or fall-ouer him.

8. Behold / eauen-thus with such a Love / Math. 24. a.
waxen-colde: For if anyman now see or perceive anything in his Brother / that
he lives not reversed;in all; perfectly / according to his outward Eye / so
has he then a Lothsonnes in him / and taking-offence at him / he
blaspheameth and accuses him / and makes his Sins or Transgressing manifest
/ among other-moe / or-els he seperateth himself from him.

9. But ye reversed;ye Deerlie-beloued; shall not so do / in the Service of
the Love: but shall stand ready to help your Brother / with all Love and
Resonablenes / and exhort him to Amendment / and take the Burden of his Sins
upon you / as your own Fault or Sins: and euenso reversed;for to rid him
out of the Burden of his Sins; help to Call. 6. a.
bear his Burden. Yea / This is the right Love / whereunto ye are exhorted in
the Service of Love: and also that ye are deptour reversed;(...) shew^fourth
the same Love and such a kind or beneuolent Heart / toward one-another of you.

The V. Chapter.
Heer-in declares HN, how the Man shall endeavor himself / against the
Assaulting with the Evil: and after-that he expresses / how the Man
reversed;in his Bufreedom or Servitude of the Sin; shall apply him / for to
attain to the right Freedom which God accepts / and is inherited of the
Children of God.



2. If he then reversed;in his Assaulting; have a right consideration on the
gracious Word of the holy Spirit of Love / and on the Service of his
Requiring / so shall he then likewise rightly perceive and understand / to
what-maner of good Being that the gracious Word requires him / and with his
Service / bids him for to com (whereunto he is also Genesis 1. c. Sap. 2. c.
Eccli. 17. a.
created by God^ and called through Christ and his holy Spirit of Love.) And
having now seene-into the same / so shall he then likewise verelie reversed;in
Prayer unto his God; suffer-out ye Assaulting goodwillinglie / and geeue God
thanks for his Grace / which He reversed;in these last Days; extends on
the Children of Men / in that He Ephe. 2. 2.
rayseth-vpp us reversed;which lay utterly smothered in the Death and
Damnation; through his Love / and calls us so graciously unto him / in his
godly Being.

3. For euenso in the Temptation / the Man can well finde-out / on what Place
he stands: and also perceive / how farre-wyde he yeat is from the God of
Life^ and from his lovely Being / which ought to have his Dominion in him.
and not / that wicked ungodly Being / which has reigned over him.

4. And when now the Man reversed;in his Temptation; Iam. 5. b.
shew-fourth Patience against the Assaulting which so meets him / till that
he reversed;in the Obedience of the Word; have plucked-on a Stronger / which
subdueth the ungodly Being of the Enemies of God / and utterly rooteth them
out: For such a Grace receive they all which hear and believe the gracious
Word of the holy Spirit of Love / in his Service and Requiring / and are
obedient to the same.

5. Therefore ought we not to afflict ourselves with overmuch heauynes /
when as the Iniquity is stirred up in us / in the time of our Temptation. but
consider therthrough / how wholly that we reversed;in the Estraunging from
our God; have been incorporated into the ungodly Being: and so then to thank
God / for that He reversed;through the serviceable Word of his Love; riddeth
or leads us Vnworthyons therout / and John. 15. b. Col. 1. a.
planteth us again in his godly Being / for to bring-fourth the Fruits of
Righteousness.

6. When we now see thus into all thissame / and thank God for his Grace / so
are we strengthened in our Hope / unto Patience: and we Phil. 3. c. 1. Tess.
1. c.
wait euenso on Him / which is our Salvation / and which also is stronger then
we are / for that we might euenso reversed;with Meeknes and steadfast Minds;
be implanted into him / and so vanquish the Iniquity with Him. For with our
own Power / we are able to do nothing against the Iniquity / as thoroughly
to vanquish the same / or utterly to destroy it. And therefore ought we always
reversed;under the Obedience of the Word; to Esa. 59. c. Romans 11. d.
hope on the Appeering and Coming of that Strongone / which remoueth the
ungodly Being from us / according to the Promises.

Math. 1^. c. Luke 11. c. Col. 2. b.
Stronger / vanquish the Evil reversed;which had plucked us on for a certain
season; and keep the Victory ther-against. Therefore shall our Hope
reversed;in all our Assaulting; rest always grounded thereon / till that He
become / which is Abac. 2. a. Heb. 10. d.
for to com / according to the Promises.

8. And although now that we reversed;in our Assaulting; feel our Feeblenes
against the Iniquity / yet shall we not for-all-that / doubt of the Coming of
our Salvation: but laud and thank God / and acknowledge that it is mere Grace
/ that we so Insee / Romans 7. b. 2. Cor. 12. b.
feel and perceive our Weakness / through the Requiring of the gracious Word /
which always requires reversed;against the Assaulting to the Iniquity; the
upright Righteousness of us: And euenso with sighing Hearts / say before God:

9. O Lord / I have a Lust reversed;even with my whole Heart; to accomplish
the Requiring of thy gracious Word: but the Iniquity wher-into I am
incorporated / is Math. 12. ^. Luke 11. c.
stronger then I am: and the same holds me captive reversed;with Violence;
against my Will: in such-sort / that I reversed;O God; cannot accomplish / that
which thy Word requires. Therefore reversed;O God; I hope in Patience / on the
Coming of thy Salvation / which shall utterly Romans 16. c.
tread-downe the Iniquity reversed;in my Mind; under thy Feete^ and take-in
and bear the Dominion therouer / for to purify euenso my Heart reversed;O
God; to thy Dwelling.

10. Therefore / we ought in all our Fourthgoing / John. 8. d. Romans 6. c. 2.
Pet. 2. b.
Servant of the Sin / ought not to seek nor-yet take-on any Freedom unto him
/ in y^ Sin: for the same should then be altogether false.

11. For although that the Man seek oftentimes / to be unbound or made-free
from This or That / yet seeks he not the same oftentimes / for
to be than a Servant or Minister of the Lord / nor-yet for the Lord-his
Righteousness cause: but for to live at-peace / after his-owne Will^ and
according to the Minds of his Fleash. And although now the Man does som-tymes
take-on such-thinges to himself / or that he obtayneth such a false Freedom or
Peace / yet is he notwithstanding not free. but much-more a Servant of his
own Minds: and bydeth nevertheless in Captivity or Bondship.

12. When As we now see-into all this / according to the Truth / so ought we
only to seek after the upright John. ^. c.
Freedom of the Children of God / which is required out of the Word of the
Lord. And when we then reversed;at any time; perceive / that we are not
reversed;according to the Requiring of the Lord-his Word; rightly made-free /
but rest yeat bound or owned / on our Minds or Opinions / So shall we not
then seek any other thing ther-against / but to become Servants or Ministers
of the Lord / for to serve the Lord / and to be altogether obedient / to the
Requiring of his gracious Word and Service of Love.

Romans 6. b.
Servants or Ministers of the Lord / so shall the Lord likewise reversed;in
the John. 8. d.
Obedience of the Requiring of his Word; bring unto us the upright Freedom of
the Children of God. Therefore ought we not to hunt-after any Freedom /
according to our own Minds: but first to apply us dilligentli reversed; / to
the Work of the Lord / and to show Obedience unto the Requiring of his
Word / for to become euenso Servants of the Lord: and not to seek els-what
in the Service of his Word / but to humble us with whole Heart / under the
Requiring of his Word.

14. When we then are thus the Lord-his Servants / so shall the Lord also
reversed;in the same good-willing Obedience to the Doctrine of his Word;
reveal or declare the Truth of his Christ unto us: and the same John. ^.
Truth shall make us rightly free / and release us out of all Bondshipping:
In such-sort / that we shall then set ourselves / with all That which is the
Lords reversed;as submitted; under the Lorde^ and under the Service of his
holy Word of the godly Love / for to live euenso with all the Children of
God and Christ / in the upright godly Freedom / and to serve only the living
God / in Luke 1. ^.
upright Righteousness and Holiness.

The VI. Chapter.
A clear Distinction / between the Heavenly and the Earthly: and how that
the Immortal / is become mortal: and how it shall putt-on the Immortality
again.

NOman ascends unto Heaven / John. ^. b. Ephe. 4. a.
comes or descends from Heaven. The which figureth-fourth unto us in
Cleernes / that the earthly Fleash and Blood / cannot ascend to Heaven /
in-as-much as it is not of the Heaven / but of the Earth. But the holy Being
of God / which God the Father reversed;out of his holy Heaven; has grounded
or set^ reversed;from the Beginning; in the Manhod / and is in us reversed;for
our Sins cause; become mortal / has the sure Promises / to risevpp again in
immortal Glory: and that the same shall reach / from the Man on the Earth /
eauen unto God / in the Heaven / for to make-knowen reversed;out of the Heaven;
unto the Man / on the Earth / the heavenly Goods / and to bring the same unto
him / out of the Heaven / and thereto / the eternal Life.

2. And That is it whereof Paul has also witnessed in tymes-past / where he
says: 1. Cor. 15. f.
When the Mortal has putt-on the Immortality / then shall the Death be
destroyed in Victory.

3. Verelie / the Mortal reversed;whereof Paul witnesses; is not any Creature
of the earthly Fleash and Blood: but it is the living Word or Being of God /
which in Genesis 1.
the Beginning / was immortal in the Manhod / and is in us reversed;for our
Sins cause; become mortal. For thatsame reversed;so-long as the Sin has
the Victory in us; is in us / as One dead: And although it bears our Sins
/ and purges or makes us safe from the Sin / yet have we not so Esa. 53.
b. Act. 8. c.
esteemed it. but accounted it as if it were nothing. The which we may also
right easelie perceive euenso in us / so long as we rest subject to the Sin.
For if ye seek in your inward sinful Manhod / the good and heavenly Being
of God / and ye upright Virtue and Righteousness / so find ye not the same Romans
7. c.
living in you. but rather Genesis 6. c.
all Iniquity / and all wicked Inclinations.

4. When we then see-into thissame / so must Math. ^. Luke ^.
of Repentance / against his Sins and sinful Lusts / and that God euenso
raisevpp his godly Being / in the Man / and that his Glory become great eauen
unto the Heaven.

5. Yea / even than at the same time / shall the Mortal putt-on again the
Immortality / and the Death Esa. 25. b. 1. Cor. 15. c.
shall be swallowed-vpp / in Victory. And thatsame heavenly Being of God /
shall ascend unto Heaven / and yet notwithstanding remain still
conformeablie-vnyted with the Man / euenlike as it came from Heaven: and the
Man shall then likewise bide everlastingly / one Soul and one Body with
the same / and be always with his Spirit / where God and his Christ is. It is
very-true.

6. OH / That the Man understood the upright Genesis 1. c. Sap. 1. 2. c. Eccli.
17. a.
created by God / and also called through Christ! so should then all earthly
Things be esteemed of him for no worthyer / then if they were Dirt. Yea /
although the whole Earth reversed;eauen unto the Heaven; were covered with
Gold / yet were it all no-more / to be compared to the godly Being and his
upright Righteousness / then an Handful of Chafe / to a great Heap of good
Wheat.

7. Behold / this costly heavenly 1. Cor. 4. a.
Treasure / is hid in the Man / and becomes presently raysedvpp in the Man /
in the Obedience of the Service of Love. The Same becomes now likewise
reversed;out of the Service of Love; distinctlie declared and expressed among
Many: and yet how Few are-ther that rightly meditate or seeke-after the same.

8. OH reversed;alas; How exceedingly does the Man oftentimes afflict himself
with sorrow / for a little Loss of the earthly things / and lame^teth
the same Damaige al-to-much [which notwithstanding is no-more worthy / to be
compared to the Damaige of the upright Righteousness and heavenly Goods / then
the Loss of an Handful of Chafe / to the Loss of an hundred Quarters of
Wheat.] But for the most-great Loss reversed;as that he misseth / and
finds not in him / the upright Righteousnes^ the living Word of God the
Father^ and the Mercifulnes of the upright Being of Jesus Christ; he does not
once lament / or reversed;at lest-wise; very-little! Oh / what a lamentable
Misery is it / to have such an Ignorance!

Esa. 5^. b.
Estraunging from God and his Word / so can not he likewise reversed;although
he would neuer-so-faine; turn him again rightly unto God. For like as the
good Being of God reversed;through the Disobedience to the Word of God and
his Doctrine; is become as dead or mortal in us / eauen so dead must likewise
the Man reversed;through the Obedience to the Word of God and his Doctrine; he
with the good Being of God / if he will be Ephe. ^. ^.
raised-vp with the same / to the Life of Righteousness. For euenso reversed;in
the Death of the old Man of Sin; does the good Being of God 2. Cor. 4. b.
arise in the Man / and standeth-vpp / to his Glory / and then likewise with
him / the Man. Wherein also then the Man inheriteth all spiritual and heavenly
Goods / and thereto the eternal Life. It is very-ture.

The VII. Chapter.
Of the upright Christian Battle / against the Enemies of the Life.

WHen the Man will prepare or endeavor Ephe. 6.
putt on him the Armor of Christ, and let himself be made-fast on the
Patience: and all that which dwells or is borne in him reversed;that has
also a Lust with him to the Battle; shall he in like-maner arm thereto /
eauen as himself: and so then pursue Genesis 14. d.
and fall-vpon his Enemies / and utterly root them out.

2. When the Man has now in such-sort reversed;as a goodwilling and valiant
Soldier of Jesus Christ; orderly attempted the Battle / and reversed;in the
christian 2. Tim. 2. ^.
Battle; vanquished all his Enemies / with the Patience of Christ, so comes
then unto him the High Priest of Righteousness (like as the High Priest
Melchisedech, Genesis 14. d.
came unto Abraham, when he had vanquished his Enemies:) For in the
Vanquishing of our Enemies / there appears unto us the Heb. ^. c.
High Priest Christ, which comes unto us out of the heavenly Being / and
brings us the heavenly Food of the everlasting Life / and the Riches of the
spiritual and heavenly Goods.

Math. 16. c. Luke 9. c.
takevp our Cross / against our Enemies / and to followe-after our Lord Jesus
Christ / in his Passe-ouer / until that all our Enemies be destroyed and
vanquished / through the Cross / and that we euenso have accomplished the
true Godseruice / in the Holie^ or ben obedient unto the End / to-wit / even
unto the Death of the Sin.

4. For the Obedience of the true Godseruice of Jesus Christ / till unto the
Romans 6. a. Phil. 2. a.
Death of the Cross / is the Vanquishing of the Enemies of the Life / and the
Accomplishing of the daily Godseruice / in the Holy. After which
Accomplishing of the same Godseruice / in the Holy / Heb. 7. ^.
comes ye High Priest Christ, and appears in the Most-holie: and erecteth
euenso the 1. Cor. 13. c.
Perfection in us.

5. Behold / in this Obedience of God the Father reversed;to the Accomplishing
of the Godseruice in the Holy; is Christ Heb. 6. 9. b.
gone before us / and has been obedient to his Father / even to the Death.
namely / to the Romans 6. a. Phil. 2. a.
Death of the Cross / wherein he has found the Purging of the Sin / to our
Safe-making / to thend that we should 1. Pet. 2. 4. a
followe-after Him / in the same Way / to the Purging of our Sins / for to
inherit euenso with him, the everlasting Life.

6. Verelie / to shew-fourth thissame Obedience / 3. Reg. 3. b. 2. Pa^. 1. b.
Solomon prayed.

7. Therefore / apply yourselues now obedientlie^ to this gracious Word of the
godly Wisdom / which is presently reversed;even in thissame Day; 1. Pet. 1. b.
administered unto you / and turn not away yourselues in anywise therform /
through Unbelief / that ye be not vanquished by the Iniquitie^ nether-yet
wholly like unto y^ Iniquity / in her Nature. For the Unbelievers and
Resisters or Blaspheamers of this Word and Light of Life / together with all
such as reversed;according to the Nature of the Iniquity; become offended
therat^ or at the Ministers of the same / shall increase fourth-and-fourth
reversed;if they repent not; in the Iniquity / until that they be utterly 2.
Tim. ^. b.
deliuered-ouer to the Iniquitie^ become of-one-beeing with thesame^ and their
Hearts hardened.

The VIII. Chapter.
Of the outward and inward World / and of the outward and inward Heaven: and
how that we are all called and bidde^ / to the precious Bewties and Riches of
the inward heavenly Being: and also how that we ought to show (...) thankful
to the God of Life / for the same Grace.



2. We cannot likewise so conceive in our Thoughts, of the outward Heaven
reversed;which incompasseth the whole outward World; to be so great, glorious,
and bewtifull / but that the inward Heaven reversed;wherein God Esa. 66. a. Act.
7. f.
with his Christ and Holy-gost / and with all his Holy^ns / dwells and lives
essentiallie; is far-away much greater and gloriouser / and much bewtifuller of
Cleernes and Garnishing.

3. Oh / That the Man could once conceive or insee / what singular pure Bewties
and Riches of God / are to be beholden and inherited in the true heavenly
Being: and also perceived that he were seduced with the Spirits of Error
which Ephe. ^. a.
reign in the Air / and with the Imagination of his Knowledge / therfrom^ and
so degenerated or estraunged reversed;ther-without; touching the same! So were
it not then possible that he could rejoice him / in that case of his
Estraunging from the same / nether yet in any-wise be at-quiet / before that he
were com thereunto again / or had therewith his communion or mutual-fellowship /
in all upright Righteousness and Holiness.

4. For the Love to the same should be so great / and the Value thereof / should
be so worthy in the Man's estimation / that he should Phil. 3. a.
recon or think all other outward Things reversed;in comparison thereof; to be
but Dirt. For in itself it is so great^ and his Bewties / Riches / and Life /
are so many Romans 11. d. Ephe. 3. b.
and infinite / that it cannot be written nor spoken-fourth.

5. Behold / Heer-to [namelie / to this heavenly Being and his upright
Righteousness / and to the Conformable-vnyting of all his Bewtifulnes and
Riches] ye are all presently reversed;through the serviceable Word of the
holy Spirit of Love; called and courteouslie-bidden.

6. Therefore / look now all well to it / that ye 2. Cor. 6. a. Heb. 11. b.
to be small. but heartelie-imbrace the same that is heald-fourth before you and
offered unto you / and reversed;out of all your Souls and Power; endeavor you
always ther-after / in all Humility and Lowlynes. For the same that is
presently heald-fourth and offered unto you / chances to you all out of
Grace / through the Mercies of God extended on you. For which Grace and Mercies
cause so extended on you / it behooves you all likewise very-well [namelie /
eueryone to whom these heavenly Goods / and this everlasting Life
reversed;through the serviceable Word of Grace; is administered / and that is
bidden thervnto] always to shewfourth Lowlynes of Heart^ and all Thankfulness
to the God of Life: and think:

7. O God / I Vnworthyone / had no-doubt bidden full in all my Corrupt-estate
and Estraunging from thee / and perseuered in all mine Iniquity and in the
Error of the same / if that thou reversed;O Lord; had not reversed;through
the gracious Service of thy Love; called Me therout!

8. Therefore must I reversed;O God; thank thee always and for ever / for that
thou reversed;through the serviceable Word of thy Grace; do so graciously
lead me Vnworthyone ther-out / eauen to the Throne of thy heavenly Majesty.

Act. 10. ^. Ephe. 3. b.
Grace and merciful Love / over me poor Sinner. Therefore reversed;O God;
have mercy also reversed;I beseech thee; on all Men-synners and Women-synners
/ which seek thee without thy gracious Word and Service of Love / and so
Luke 23. c. Act. 7. f.
ignorantly do err.

Act. 7. f.
pray for all Sinners / which err ignorantly: and recon this Phil. 1. c.
for his Said / namely / that he may pass into the Death / with the Word
of the good Being of God / to the Purging of his Sins: For so shall he
reversed;with the Word of the good Being of God; rise-vpp again from the
Death / to the eternal Life.

The IX. Chapter.
Of the right Accusation or Chastisement / which comes unto the Man / out of
the Word and his Service / to Repentance for his Sins / and to the
Amendment of his Life.

EVeryone ought to take very good-heed / Gal. 4. c.
have a living Shape in him. And till the same Time / let him hold wholly all
his Love turned only thereunto.

2. For / to love anywhat besides the Light of Life and the godly Virtue / is
nothing-els but an unknown erring Darkness / and a bewitched Sin: the which
Genesis 3 a. b. 2. Tess. 2. a.
is an apostated Being / and a Seducing from the living God and his
Righteousness / wherein all Men Romans 7. ^.
have been captiued. Of which bewitched Sin / the gracious Word does also
accuse or blame eueryone / and calls them to Repentance / to the end that
eueryone should euenso reversed;in his Repentance; look upon his own Sinnes^
and not blame one-another / but exhort each-other to the Good. and so inset or
consider / that none of all the Children of Men / have been lose or free from
the Sin.

3. Therefore shall not the Accusation or Math. 23.
Chastisement / that comes out of the gracious Word or Service of Love / be
reversed;at anytime; cast-back: for the same is upright. But verelie / it is far
different from the Accusation or Reproof that proceeds from the goodthinking
Man / or out of anymans corrupt Conscience / through the Knowledge: and wherewith
also the one Man accuses or reprehendeth the-other / and exhorts him not to
Repentance.



5. And when we then euenso reversed;through the Word or the Ministers
thereof; do perceive or understand our Unrighteousness or Error / so shall we
then reversed;without delay; Math. ^. Luke 3. Act. 2.
show Repentance for the same / and apply us reversed;with all Humility; to
the Requiring of the Word / and say or confess before God / in our Hearts:

6. O God reversed;full of Grace and Truth; How lovely is thy Being / and
into what a foreign Being am I yeat incorporated! I must evermore thank thee
reversed;O God; for that there is made-knwen unto me reversed;with thy Word
and through thy Word and Service of Love; all what-euer is contrary to thy
Being.

7. Oh reversed;alas; I was almost become of-one-mind Genesis 1. c. Sap. 2. c.
am created / and called-vnto / and to what a foreign Being / I am fallen and
have inclyned myself.

8. WHen now the Man reversed;through the serviceable Word of the holy Spirit
of Love; exercises himself daily heerin / and does euenso / so shall he then
receive reversed;in all Thankfulness unto God; the Accusation or Chastening
reversed;that comes unto him out of the Word / or thorough the Word and his
Service of Love; to Repentance for his Shines / and to the Reformation of his
Beeing^ and not construe the same to the worst / but take-heede from
thence-fourth / that he sin not against the Word / and that he transgress
John. ^. b.
not any-more / in that wherein he has fallen al-redie.

The X. Chapter.
How one shall hate and leave the Iniquitie^ and not geeue an^ care nor regard
either credit unto her / nor to her Ministers / in their Assaulting and
Accusation.



2. And although now the Iniquity reversed;or her Ministers; would accuse
the same goodwilling Man / with anything that God nor his Word requires / for
to burden or snare his Conscience therein: Or although the wicked Being
reversed;for to make him unbelieving to the Fourth-going of the good Life / and
to declyne therfrom / or to waver in his Conscience; said inwardly or
outwardly unto him: Yea / what take thou upon thee / for to attain to the
Righteousness / the which thou art in no-wise able to do / and whereof also thou
have no Sight nor Understanding: for thou art doubtless become altogether one
Body and Mind / with the Iniquity. For-that-cause also / thou belongest
altogether to the Iniquity: and the same has wholly the Dominion over thee /
to thy Condemnation.

3. Howbeit / although such-thinges chance unto 1. John. ^. c.
be judged of his evil Conscience: but he shall geeue so much the greater
credit and regard to the great Grace 1. Pet. 1. c.
and Mercy of God / which God has brought unto him / through his gracious
Word and Service of Love; for therthrough shall the Persuasion of the
Iniquity / vanish-away by him / and perrish or com-to-nought.

4. For if the Iniquity reversed;when as we consented unto her; has obtained
the Victory in us / How much-more then shall God with his Grace reversed;which
doubtless is much Math. 12. c. Luke 11. c.
stronger then the Iniquity; prevail or take the Victory in us reversed;in
far-more abundant Power; against the Iniquity reversed;seeing that we now
hate the Iniquity / and geeue our consent unto the Good; / and through ye
Service of the Love / purge Heb. 9. d.
our Consciences from the Iniquity; and euenso prepare and make us meet / for
to inherit his Kingdom and everlasting Life.

5. When the Man now finds himself in such Ephe. 6. ^.
Belief and Hope of his Salvation / and humble himself always obedientlie /
under the gracious Word of the Lord and the Requiring of his Service of Love:
and also keep a steadfast Hope on the John. 14. 16. 2. Pet. 1. d.
Promises of the Word. For the Romans ^. a.
Hope will not suffer him to com to reproch^ but bring the Patience unto him /
in his Assaulting / to a Releassing of him from his Temptation.

6. The Man now standing euen-thus in his Abascing / shall pray continually
unto God / and speak reversed;against the Iniquity and her Persuasions; in
his Heart: No / thou Iniquity / there belongs nothing-at-all unto thee: No /
not the smallest Hear of my Head: For thou art of Apo. 17. b.
Nothing / and to-nothing shall thou go again / in the Condemnation.



8. O thou Iniquity / I belong not unto thee / that thou should hold me
as thine Own: for thou have not created me. But the God of the Living and of
all Righteous / is Genesis 1.
my Creator* and to him do I belong. But in that thou have gotten the Dominion
over me / thereto have Genesis 3. b.
thou begyled me with thy Falshod / and have euenso destroyed me / and made
me subject unto thee. But now reversed;through Gods Grace and his Service of
Love; my Hope rests on the same God / my Creator / that He will
reversed;against thee; take again the Dominion over me.

9. Wherefore should I reversed;O thou Iniquity; think / according to thy
Persuasion / that anye-thing should appertain unto thee / or that thou
should have any Power for to condemn Me / through thy Infidelity / whereas
thou art risenvpp reversed;out of the Condemnation; even of Nothing / and have
euenso Romans 7. ^.
taken captive mine Heart reversed;with that which is Nothing; in thy Bands?
Therefore will I altogether submitt me / under God my Creator / He will help
me up again / and reversed;through his Word and Service of Love; releasse
me from thy Bands / and bring thee again to-nothing / in the Condemnation /
like-as thou mast before time.

10. Behold / In such-sort shall the Man G^^. 3.
falleth-away from the good Being / or estraungeth himself therfrom / so much
Judgment of the Condemnation plucketh he over himself: And so much as he
loves his Goodthinking / and that which is Nothing or vain / so much loves
he the Darkness. And That is the Man's John. ^. ^.
Condemnation / when he loves the Darkness / more then the Light. It is very*
true.

The XI. Chapter.
A clear Demonstration / that the Service of the Law after the Letter / and
the Service of Christ after the Fleash / have both one (...) Ministration to
the Death of y^ Sin: and that then the new Birth in Jesus Christ after the
Spirit / springs therout.

Christ after the Fleash / unto the Believers of Christ / to an Entrance
reversed;with Christ; into Romans 6.
the like Death of his Cross (to-wit / into the Obedience of the Belief of
Christ) and to mortify and bury the Sin / So is-it both right / and well
said / if the Law of the Lord and his Christ have a Shape in the same
Minister: and it is both one-maner of Service / unto the Believers of ye Word
to a Righteousness of Life.

2. For / to administer Christ after the Fleash / is a Service / which also
reversed;life-as the Service of the Law; reaches to Romans ^. b.
the Death of the Sin: and so then fourth / to the Making-aliue of y^
Inward-man of God / in Jesus Christ after the Spirit.

3. Therefore says Peter thus: Christ has suffered for us / and 1. Pet. 2. c.
left us such an Example / to thend that we should follow his Foote-steppes.

Christ himself says also: Whosoever will be my Disciple / let him Math. 10.
16 Mark. ^. Luke ^. 14.
forsake himself / and takevpp his Cross on him / and follow after me. And
That is the right Imitacion of Christ, that we should followe-after him
reversed;in the Doctrine of his Requiring; obedientlie / even unto his Romans 6.
Death and Burying / and unto his Resurrection from the Death. And This is the
Inheriting of the eternal Life / in the heavenly Being / wherein Christ after
the Spirit / lives and triumphs reversed;with his Father and all his
Saints; perpetually.

5. Therefore / to the end that his Disciples / might inherit the eternal Life
with Him / they must first followe-after Him reversed;in the Foregoing of his
Doctrine and Requiring; obedientlie / till into his like Death / and then
euenso out of the same Death / obtain the new Birth in Jesus Christ after the
Spirit / and inherit the eternal Life.

6. For-that-cause / men ought to consider rightly / Christ after the Fleash:
For in themselves they have both / one Mind or Sense: and lead both to one
Entrance of the Mortifying and Deprivation of all ungodly Being. For all
that which goeth-before out of God / before the new Birth in Jesus Christ after
the Spirit / and has his Ministration to the true Righteousness / does point or
direct the Man to the Death and Laying-away of the Sin in the Fleash. And
That is it whereof Paul speaks / saying: The Letter 2. Cor. 3. ^.
slays [namelie / the Ministration of the Law after the Letter / or the
Ministration of Christ after the Fleash.] And That is nothing-els / but that
the Letter / according to the Requiring of the Law / and according to the
Requiring of Christ / points and leads us Romans 6.
to the Death of the Sin / and withdraws euenso our Minds and Thoughts /
from all that which is vngodlie^ and vain and consumeable on the Earth / for
that we might euenso attain to the everlasting Vnconsumeablenes / in the
eternal Life / wherein all Understandings of pure Hearts do live and dwell.



8. And when as we then do humble ourselves obedientlie / under the Law or
under the serviceable Word / for to accomplish the same in his Requiring: and
to become euenso reversed;with the Law / or with Christ after the Fleash / and
with his Faith to Justification; Romans 6.
implanted into Christ with like Death^ baptized in his Death^ and washed with
his Blood / So cometh-ther then unto us / the Spirit of the Law / or the Romans
^. b.
Making-aliue in Jesus Christ after the Spirit. It is very-true.

The XII. Chapter.
A clear Demonstration / that the Man has not any-Good of himself: but
receaueth it all of the Lord and his Grace.

O Ye goodwilling Hearts to the Romans 15. a. Gal. 6. a. 1. Tess. 5. b.
each-other in your Weatnes: and infourme each-other with the Coadiuuation or
Hand-reaching of the serviceable Word of the holy Spirit of Love. And if
any-man chance to fall / so help-vpp then each-other again: and he that
bydeth standing / let him laud the Lord / for his Strength. For y^ Strength
reversed;or the Power; so much as the same remains with us / to the Good / is
only the Lords / out of his Grace. and not out of our-selues.

2. For-that-cause / think or have always before your Eyes / in your
Fourth-going to y^ good Being of God / that ye have received all your Lust /
Love / and Stabilitie or Faithfulness reversed;which ye show to the Lord and
his Word; of the Lord and his Grace.

3. For what have ye reversed;I pray you; to serve the Lord with all / but
that ye have 1. Par. 19. c. 1. Cor. 4. b. Iam. 1. a.
received it of the Lord: or the Lord must first bring the same unto you / by
his Grace and Mightynes: both all that wherewith ye serve your-selues and
another also?

4. Therefore ought the Man always to hold Sins / Except that they had been
made-knowen unto me / through thy serviceable Word / and that it were
granted me to perceive them by thy Grace: and that thou euenso
reversed;through thy Power or Mightynes; releasedst me therfrom? For if I
reversed;O Lord; have any Love to thee and thy Word / so have I then received
the same / of thy Grace [namel^^ / in the Romans 10. c.
Hearing and Crediting of the Ministration of thy Word.] For in Me
reversed;through my Consenting to the Sin; there is nothing-els but all
Inclination Genesis 6. a. Romans 7. b.
to the Destruction. And if I reversed;O Lord; remain standing reversed;in
any Righteousness; by thy Word / so comes the same to me from thy Grace / and
from the Power that thou have geeuen or brought unto me.

5. For-that-cause truly / we must needs always confess / that we cannot
bring any Good unto God / nor-yet serve him with anything / but with That which
we have received of Him and his Grace.

6. Thissame acknowledged likewise the kingly Propheat David and the holy
Solomon, when as they presented or offered-vpp their S^^stes or Oblation /
before the Lord / and said: ^. P^^. ^^. c.
O Lord / All things com of thee / and that which we have received at thine
Hands / that have we brought again unto thee.

that he brings again unto ye Lord / that which he has received of Him.

8. But if now the man think otherwise / or that he account the same / to be
his-owne Work / so misseth he the Right / and looks upon his own Doing
reversed;wherthrough he seeks Praise or Honor; and not upon the Lords
Grace / for to laud and thank therein the Lord / for his Gift.

9. But a lowly Man / which acknowledges that all that which is good / and
don by Him as good or wel-don / is the Lord-his Good and Weldooing / as the
Gift of the Lord 1. Cor. 4. b.
which he has received: and euenso thanketh the Lord / for that which is His
/ and reversed;according to the Requiring of the serviceable Word of the
Lord; bringeth-againe unto the Lord / that which is His / He knows then
himself a-right / how Ap^. 3. d.
poor that he is / as also of himself / the Most-feeble or Infirmest: and
that the Lord only / is all in All. And acknowledges euenso reversed;in the
Belief; to have received all Good and 2. Cor. 4. b.
Strength / at the Lords Hands.

10. And euenso in such a Confessing reversed;that we are altogether poor and
infirm of our-selues; will God be gracious unto us / and reversed;with his
Guiftes; bring his Power unto us. And when we then / confess it all to be the
Lords reversed;to-wit / that we have received all that is good / of the Lord;
/ so shall we then also have always reversed;under the Obedience of the
Service of Love; compassion toward another / which staggereth or falls / or
that is not yeat so altogether perfect: and euenso Romans 15. d. Gal. 6. ^.
beare-with and suffer one-another / and help-vpp each-other from the Fall.

11. When we now in such-sort / shew-fourth the Love one toward another / so
shall then also eueryone be moved to think in himself: Oh reversed;alas; If
there were no Grace nor Love showed on mee^ nether any Help chanced unto me /
by the Lord and his Ministers of the Word / so should I then doubtless myself
/ have still remained the greatest Sinner / and the Most-weake / among the
Children of Men.

12. If we now do euen-thus / and deal or behave ourselves so reversed;in
all Grace and Love; toward each-other / so geeue we then the Honor only
unto God / and not unto our-selues: And the Evil shall likewise euenso be
washed-away^ and all Offencifenes cleene rooted-out / from among us: and there
shall be nothing that can 1. Pet. ^. b.
hinder us / for to have our conversation in all Love and upright Righteousness
/ one with an-other.

The XIII. Chapter.
A groundlie Instruction / how we should be faithful / to the Lord and his
gracious Word: also geeue-ouer ourselves wholly thereto: and reversed;with
faithful Hearts; clean unto the same.

/ by his Elder in the holy Understanding and Minister of the gracious Word
/ for to become taught therein.

2. And although now all this com thus topasse / or when as the same has in
such-sort his Entrance / so is not the Man then received or admitted under the
gracious Word of the Lord / that he should live / besides the Doctrine of
the Word / unto himself or his Goodthinking. but that he should 2. Cor. 5. b.
show all Obedience and Faithfulness / to the Word / and to the Service of his
Doctrine or Requiring.

3. For when as the Man is received by the gracious Word / in his Service of
Love / for to stand obedient: and that he has consented thereunto / so has
he then geeuen-ouer himself and his Fidelity / to the gracious Word and to
the Service of his Requiring / for to do reversed;through the same Word and
his Service; the Will of the Lord.

4. For euenso in the Conjunction of the Man with all his Heart: like as a
faithful Espowsed-wife promises her Husband / not to love nor addict herself
to any other / nor-yet to depart from him / for any manner of cause.

5. Verelie / even so wholly and altogether ought we also to cleave unto the
Word and to the Service of his Requiring: in such-sort / that y^ Word and his
Requiring / should be y^ Deerlyest-beloued in our Hearts. For at that time
reversed;when we have turned our Love so wholly to the Word and his
Requiring; there can no Assaulting indamaige or hinder us: Yea / although there
came an hundred thousand. For we are so fast-knitt and established with the
Love of our Heart / on the Word and his Requiring / that they all / are not
able to pluck us from the Word / nor to make us consent to any Evil or
Vanity. For the Lord the strong God is than our Helper / and Math. 6. b. Luke
11. a.
Releasser from all Evil.

Love: in such-sort / that the same should be ye Deerlyest-beloued / in our
Hearts / to thend that we euenso reversed;through the Love; might bide
altogether faithful unto thesame^ and endeavor us always obedientlie /
according to the Requiring of his Service of Love: and that the same might be
all our Lust and Will.

7. But / if in the mean time reversed;er-euer we be so altogether
swallowedvpp in the Love of y^ Word; there chance any Job. 5. b. Iam. 1. a.
Temptation / by our Paramours reversed;which we in times-past have loved; to
com unto us or assault us / So shall we then turne-away our Love altogether
from them / and turn the same wholly and in all / to the Word of Grace: and
exercise ourselves fourth-and-fourth / in his Service of Love: and euenso cry
and pray unto God for Help / to our Math. 6. b. Luke 11. a.
Releassing from their Temptation / and from the Evil / whereunto they would
seduce us: and so with the Grace and Help of the Lord / to take good-heede /
that we incline not to their Desires / for to commit sin with them.

8. But if they take or lay-holde on us with Force and Violence / and that then
reversed;although we cry; there comes not any Power nor Help unto us / for
to withstand them in their Force and Violence* and that they euenso ravish us
against our Will / so are we giltles of the Transgressing: For we have cried
/ for to be releassed from the Tirannie of the Evil / and there is no Help com
unto us. Of which giltles Transgressing / the Law likewise witnesses / where
it says: A Woman which is violentlie-taken in the Feelde reversed;wher-as there
is not any Help; and so ravished (and although she have Deuteronomy. 22. d.
cried alowde / yet gotten no Help) she shall be giltles of the
Transgressing. But if she be in the House with any-bodie / and so holds her
peace / then is she guilty in the Transgressing of Matrimony.



10. But if we desire not to addict us to the Lusts nor Temptation to the
Iniquity / nor to do after her will / so shall we then always reversed;in
all our Assaulting; think in our Hearts / and also confess still by the
Assaulters / that we have no power reversed;contrary to the Requiring of the
Word; over our own Body / as to geeue-ouer the same to the Transgressing: but
that it belongs only unto the Lord / to his Service. Whereof also Paul
witnesses an Example unto us / where he says / that a Woman / has not 1.
Cor. 7. a. 1. Pet. 3. a.
Power of her own Body. but the Man / with whom she is entered into
Matrimony.

11. Euenso should we also have this always before our Eyes / and acknowledge
/ that our Body / is not Our Body reversed;for to do therewith our own Will
and Lusts; but the Lords / for to use the same / to an 1. Cor. 6. b.
Instrument of his service / and to all Vprightnes and Equity: and that we
also have promised and yealded-vpp the same reversed;to Righteousness; unto the
Lord: and have not any Power to use the same to anything else. as likewise all
whateuer is governed under our Hands.

12. Therefore shall the Man always continue Ephe. 6. c. Col. 4. a.
Prayer / watch continually against all the Assaulting of the Sin: and not
esteem the same Assaulting ouer-light / although he sometimes reversed;with
little Greef or Trouble; has been released therfrom.

13. For a Man which has been assaulted by any Wickedness or Vanity / and is
easelie com-thorowe the same Assaulting / thinks then sometimes so-much the
lightmindeder: I am passed-thorowe the Assaulting or Temptation thus easelie:
Let it hardly com-on again / I know wel-enough how to resist and (...)-from
the same. But reversed;oh alas; When the Man now begineth in such-sort to trust
so-much on himself / and that he means euenso / out of his Prudence or own
Power / to persevere or bide-stedfast theragainst / so does the Sin then
vanquish him / easeliest-of-all.

14. For when as the Sin or the Iniquity / does reversed;in such a
self-conceited Purpose of his; assault him / and that he persuades himself /
that it can not indamaige him / so shall he then verelie find himself
oftentimes in the Assaulting / to be to vnmightie / for to bide-stedfast therein
/ and euenso want the Grace and Help of the Lord.

Ephe. 6. c. Col. 4. a. 1. Tess. 5. c.
Prayer. If it then be well with him / as that the Sin reversed;with her
Assaulting; does not ouercom him / so shall he geeue God thanks for his Grace
/ and euenso think and confess in his Heart:

16. O God / the Power of my Stedfastnes reversed;so much as the same remains
with me; comes only 2. Cor. 4. b.
from Thee and from thy Grace / and not / from my-self. Therefore reversed;O God
/ full of Grace; If that the Assaulting chance for to meet with me again /
so extend thou then always reversed;I beseech thee; over Me poor feeble Man
/ thy Grace and Mercy: and be thou thyself always reversed;I beseech thee; my
Power and Strength / whereby that I may in the evil Day of my Temptation
reversed;as a just 2. Tim. 2. ^.
Soldier; resist the Iniquitie^ and euenso keep the Field or the Victory
with Thee and thy Word / to the Impl^^^ting of me in thy Righteousness.

17. Behold / euen-thus ought the Man always to continue in Prayer / to the
Lord / and always to shewfourth Patience / and to keep a sharp watch /
against all his Enemies of the upright Life / and Ephe. 6. b. 1. Pet. 5. b.
against all the Persuasions of the Iniquity wherwith-all he is assaulted.

18. Therefore reversed;my Beloved; take this Mat^er 1. John. 2. ^.
not commit any sin. And if it chance that anyman reversed;through Weakness;
do sin / yet let him not cover his Sins: but let him confess them before
his Elder in the holy Understanding / and Math. 3. a. Act. 3. c.
repent him / so shall then the Lord be gracious unto him / and forgeeue him
his Sins. For whosoever beareth-sorrowe for his Transgressing / and so Pro.
28. b. Eccli. 4. 17.
confesses his Sins / and leaves them / shall obtain Mercy / also be
holpen-vpp out of y^ Fall of Sinne^ and purged from his Sins. But whosoever
covers his Sins or Transgression / and lives therein / and keeps them to
himself / is a Deceauer / and has no good in his mind. It is very-true.

The XIIII. Chapter.
Of the upright Patience / under the holy Word and his Service of Love.

THe Man which turns himself to Service / nor besides the Obedience of his
Requiring: but all what seems good unto him besides y^same / or that
chances to meet / ^^m-vnto / or assault him for to take-on the same /
thatsame shall he set in the Patience. Yea / if it were so that any Joy came
unto the Man / so shall he nevertheless set the same in the Eccli. 2. ^.
Patience / and bear the same also himself / in maner-of-suffering: and so take
good-heede / that he add not his own Joy thereto.

2. For there comes oftentimes / a certain Joy unto the Man / which-proceedeth
not out of the upright Being of God / nether-yet bideth the same as a steadfast
Being / with the Man: and for-that-cause it is not the everlasting Joy / which
the gracious Word requires or promises. And therefore shall the Man always
place or set his Joy / in the Patience. If then the Being of his Joy / be out
of Gods Being / so shall the same Joy / well remain steadfast in the Patience.
But if it be not / so shall it then suddenly vanish-away.

O God / it is presently so well and good with me: I stand now so free and
loose from all Captivity or Ownednes / and my Heart is now so well at-peace:
and if he now passe-on-fourth so light-heartedlie therewith / and sets not
the same in the Patience / So shall then verelie the same Joy / Freedom / and
Appeasement / fail or perrish again by him.

4. And when he then becomes quitt again of the same / together with all the
sweet Taste and Zeal which he has had therein / or when as the same vanishes
by him / so is that then oftentimes a great Greef unto him. And when he then
finds himself again in such Heauynes / so does he then offend also therein
/ like-as in the Joy: and sets not his Sorrow / in the Patience: but he
adds more Sorrow / of his own Sorrow / thereto: and gets euenso sometimes
/ an 1. Reg. 16. ^. 18. c. 19. b.
unquiet Spirit / which vexes him: wherthrough he then also thinks
reversed;other-whyles; with himself:

5. Oh / I had such a Joy and Quickening! Oh / that I had kept the same! Oh / it
must be mine own Fault / in that I am quit thereof: or / I must have neglected
the same! And more such like / thinks the Man then. With the which he
oftentimes accuses and vexes himself / the which the Word requires not. And
thinks al-to-little on the upright Righteousness / which is required by the
Word / wherout the upright Joy proceeds.

6. Therefore / let us set Al-thinges Heb. 1^. ^.
in the it all / in the like Suffering of Christ, and passe-thorowe the same
obedientlie / So shall then also verelie reversed;in maner-of-suffering; the
upright Joy reversed;out of the John. 15. b.
Obedience of the Word; com unto us / and remain with us everlastingly.

7. For although it were so that any consumeable Joy / should fail or
fal-away from us / yet let us not be sorrowful for the same. but stay us
always obedientlie / on the Word and his Requiring / and euenso receive or
take-vp it all in the Patience. Yea / although we should be assaulted with any
Sins or unquiet Spirits / yet let us always Iam. 5. b.
persevere firm in the Patience / and consent at no time / to the Desires of
the Sin: and choose euenso to dye rather on the Patience / with Christ, then
to sin with any Joy or worldly Sorrow / or to live in the Sin.

8. Behold / euen-thus (as is said) shall we let ourselves be fastened
reversed;with the Obedience of the gracious Word; on the Patience of Christ,
till that we are reversed;in the Death Romans 6.
of the Patience of Jesus Christ; passed-thorowe our Death of the Pacience^ and
so justified from the Sin.

9. And when we then reversed;in such-sort; have perseuered firm / in the
Belief of Jesus Christ, and in the Obedience of the Requiring of the gracious
Word and his Service of Love / till into Romans 6. ^. b.
the Death / the like Patience of Jesus Christ, So are we then also assured to
inherit the Phil. 3. b.
Resurrection in Jesus Christ, and the everlasting Life.

10. For there is none other 4. Esd. 7. ^. Math. 7. b. Luke 1^. c.
Way to the everlasting Life / but the Romans 6.
like Patience of Christ, and to become implanted with the same obedientlie /
into Christ and into the Word of his holy Spirit of Love. Therefore shall we
always endeavor us hereunto / namely / to shewe-fourth Patience in all
things / and euenso reversed;in maner-of-suffering; to wait for the Act. 1. ^.
gracious Promises of God the Father.

11. If we now under ye Obedience of ye Word Christ, so shall we then
likewise let the Word of the Lord / in his Service of Love / and in all his
Counsel and Doctrine. and to shew-fourth thereby the goodwilling Obedience /
have the Foregoing with us.

12. But reversed;oh alas; there are so Few / which do thus rightly understand
the same / and yet many fewer / that endeavor themselves in such-sort thereunto.
For / for the most part / the Man is very negligent toward the Counsel and
Doctrine of the Word / for to show Obedience to the Requiring of the same:
but he himself taketh-on much rather the Foregoing unto him with his own
Will Col. 2. b.
and Election: and euenso followeth-after nothing-els but his own Goodthinking
or Opinion.

13. But if now we desire to apply ourselves vprightlie / to the Word of the
Lord / and to his Service of Love / so shall we not then deal in such-sort:
but we shall first reversed;in the Service of the Word; show faithful
Obedience: Not reversed;verelie; after our own Counsel and Will / nor yet
Deuteronomy. 12. b. 29. c.
as we thinke-good* but even as the same is set-fourth unto us / by the Elders
/ and Ministers of the Word. And if there then com unto us / in the Obedience
of the Word reversed;according to the Doctrine and Requiring of the Word; any
Joy and Life of Righteousness: and that likewise the Word / be planted in us
with (...)
Humility / so receaueth then the Word reversed;with his Doctrine / and with
our Obedience; the Foregoing to the Life / in us. For in so doing / and
reversed;ther-to; geeuing-care unto the Elders of the holy Understanding / we
do not assume or take-on the same unto us: but we thank the Lord for his
Grace / and think:

14. O God / this Joy / is thy Joy: and thou let the same com unto Me /
from thy Grace. And if thou let the same remain with me reversed;O Lord; so
thank I thee for the same: and if thou take the same again from me / so will I
yet nevertheless geeue thee thanks: Thy Math. 6. b. 26. c. Luke 22. c.
Will. be don / and not mine. For to thy Will reversed;O Lord; I have a Lust.

the-more y^ Man seeks with his own Counsel / to do thus or so / or to be
released heerthrough or therthrough / so-much the-faster becomes he bound on
his vain Being and Purpose.

16. For when as the Man binds himself on his own Purpose / so binds he
himself so-much the-stronger on the Imagination of his Knowledge: and labors
euenso therewith / for to become free. The which cannot com so to-passe: but
very-well / in the Patience / and in the Obedience of y^ Word / even as there
i^ said.

17. But reversed;oh alas; now has the Man al-to-little Ephe. 4. ^.
Righteousness and Holiness of the inward Man / which God regards / and
wherthrough Men might live and Romans 12. ^. Ephe. 4. ^.
deale-together among each-other vprightlie and peaceably / in all Concord
and Love.

18. And heere-through it chances oftentimes / that the Imagination of the
Knowledge (for that-men therthrough / are driven to somewhat that has a 2. Tim.
^. ^.
Show of Righteousness) is looked-on and believed / for an Inspiration or
Inspeaking of God: and that the Man is driven to do thus or so / or-els to
resist this or that. Wherthrough then also / the Man's Goodthinking and his C^l.
2. b.
Election (wherewith the Man seduceth himself / and other-moe which credit him)
gets the Foregoing by the Man^ and not / the Obedience of the Word. And
therefore is the Imagination of his Knowledge / a great Hinderaunce or Let unto
him / for to com to the upright Being.

19. For there shall noman attain to the upright Being / but through the
Obedience of the Word / in the Belief of Jesus Christ: and so to (...). 5. b.
shew-fourth Patience therein. And although that the Man feels / that the
Sin oppresses him reversed;or that the Dryuing of his Mind / tormenteth him
/ or that he feel an evil Mind against his good Mind; yet shall he
nevertheless hold himself on the Patience / in all Humility and Lowlynes of
his Heart and Mind / and think in his Heart:

Psalm. 40. b. Heb. 10. b.
Will / thereto reversed;O God; have I a Lust.

21. When now the Man / stands so minded to the Lords Will / and to his
Righteousness: and sheweth-fourth Patience / in Prisonment / in Vexation / in
Joy / in Sorrow / and in all whatsoever chances to meet him / in the
Obedience of the Word and his Service of Love: and euenso perseuereth therein
steadfastly / So shall he then well obtain the upright Righteousness / and 2.
Co^. ^. d.
live vprightlie in the same / both before God and Men.

22. For when as the Man has thus reversed;thorough Faith; in the like
Obedience and Patience of our Lord Jesus Christ / vanquished all his Enemies of
the Life: then shall likewise verily Iam. ^. b.
the Crown of the eternal Life be brought unto him / by the Lord Jesus
Christ.

23. Therefore shall we also daily reversed;in the Obedience of the Word /
and in the Following of his Requiring; Math. 1^. Luke 9.
take-vpp our Cross against y^ Evil / until such time as the Sin be
subdued and vtterlie-destroyed / That we may then euenso bring unto the Lord
/ a Ioyful-offering^ and live with the Lord everlastingly.

The XV. Chapter.
^her is demanded / Who be the right Disciples of the W^ord / and after what
sort then stand: also at what time / that anyone is a right Disciple of the
Word. And thereunto is answered by HN, and certain Instructions are declared
thereon / li^e as heer-after follows.

VErelie / there are very Few / that Jesus Christ [wherin they ought wholly to
geeue-ouer themselves / unto the Word and his Service of Loue] for to be
instructed by their Elder and Minister of the Word / to the Requiring and
Accomplishing of the Woord^ and taught to the Kingdom of Heaven / which speak
much good of the Word (As that the Word and his Doctrine / is right / and
that-men are directed and infourmed by the same / to the Life of Righteousness)
But Those which through the Ministration of the Word and his Service of Love
/ are touched reversed;by y^ Lords Grace; in their Inwardnes: and to whom it
is likewise granted to see-into or to know their Sins and their Estraunging
from God and his Christ: and which also then Math. 3. Luke 3.
beare-sorrowe for their Sins / confess the same before their Elder in the
holy Understanding / and wholly geeue-ouer themselves reversed;for to be
obedient; unto the Doctrine of the Word and Service of Love: and euenso
utterly 2. Cor. 6. c.
depart out of all that which they reversed;in their old and corrupted
Understanding; have liued-in / and separate themselves therfrom / for 1. Cor.
4. d. Phil. 3. c.
to ensue reversed;with all their Heart and Mind; the Doctrine of the Word /
and the Ministers of the same / obedientlie / and that they might be Iam. 1. c.
Fulfillers of the Word / and not Hearers alone: and so then to persevere firm
therein / till unto the new John. 3. a.
Birth in Jesus Christ, which is in us the Fulfilling of the Woorde^ and the
upright Life itself.

2. Behold / Those or Such reversed;which so geeue-ouer themselves wholly /
to the Requiring of the gracious Word / and are admitted thereunto / by their
Elder in y^ holy Understanding / and Minister of the gracious Word / and
persevere firmlie therein; are verily the right Disciples of the Word: and
looke-into the Word a-right / according to his Excellency. And therefore
[seeing that y^ gracious Word of the Lord / is the most-best and worthyest
Good] they love the same above all what is on the Earth / or that cleaves unto
them.

3. For verelie / the same Word / which is Jesus Christ; unto us / and
set-fourth out of the Service of Love / is well worthy to be loved / above all
what is upon the Earth / as also for the loues-cause thereof / to Luke 14. d.
forsake all that is upon the Earth. For it is the true Christ, which was
preached in times-past unto the World / to Repentance / and to a Safe-making
of them from their Sins / as also to a tocoming righteous Judge: and which is
also presently com unto us reversed;to a Fulfilling of the former Preaching;
out of Heaven / from y^ Right Hand of God his Father / for to judge Act. 10. c.
2. Tim. 4. ^. 1. Pet. 4. b.
over Living and Dead / and Act. 3.
to restore it all / what God has spoken reversed;through the Mouth of his
holy Propheates; from the Beginning of the World hitherto / euen-as there is
written thereof.

4. Where now this Word has his Incorporating / and floweth-fourth again
seruiceablie from the same / therein has Christ his Gal. 4. c.
Shape / liuinglie. and the perfect Godhead / in the same Christ. Out of whom /
the Ministration of the Word comes vprightlie to pass: and they witness in
their Ministration / the appeered Grace that comes unto all repentant Sinners
/ in the Obedience of the Word / together with the Declaring of the spiritual
and heavenly Goods / which they inherit in the everlasting Life. And That is
the Day which God Act. 17. ^.
has appointed / for to judge in the same / the Compass of the Earth with
Righteousness / through his Word / in whom / He has concluded his Judgment.

5. So many now as there are / which hear the Testimonies of the Word / and to
whom there is granted through the Ministration of those-same / to see-into
their Estraunging from Christ, and whose Sins are made-knowen unto them /
Among those verily / the Ti^. 2. b.
Grace of the Lord is appeered: and they are euenso stirred-vp through the
Word / to Act. 2. f.
adioyne themselves to the Minister of the Word / for to be instructed
reversed;by him; out of the Word / through the Word / and in the Word / to
the upright Fruits of Math. 3. Luke ^.
Repentaunce^ taught to the Kingdom of the God of Heauen^ and made Heirs in
the spiritual and heavenly Goods.

/ according to the Goodthinking of their Knowledge: and so know then
reversed;out of their Knowledge; how to prate much of the Word and Life:
Verelie / Those that so follow their Goodthinking / are no Disciples of the
Word / nether-yet do they follow the Doctrine of the Ministers of the Word:
But they themselves take-on the Foregoing / with their Knowledge and
Goodthinking / before the Word / and wrest and interpret the Word / according
to their Hearts Deu. 12. ^.
Goodthinking / and not according to the Requiring of the same.

7. For in doing so / they follow not the Requiring of the Word / nor the
Doctrine of the Eldest in the Service of the Word and of his Love: but they
exalt themselves above the Word and his Service: and euenso presume to set-vp
themselves / to Judges of the Word / and to Adversaries or Invayers against
the Ministers of the same. And lay or shutt-vp the Grace of the Lord
reversed;which is appeered unto them to Repentance; in their Prison or
Subjection / and kill euenso the same (like as Herod / Math. 14. ^.
did unto John) in their Prison / and com not to Christ, nor to the Ministers
of his Word / for to be purged from their Sins.

8. For that cause also speaks Christ reversed;which is the Word of Life
itself; well and a-right / where He says: If any-man com unto me / and hate
not his Luke 9. 14.
Father / Mother / Wife / Children. etc. He cannot be my Disciple: That is /
that he which forsakes not it all / for the Words cause / and so
followeth-after the Word reversed;in his Doctrine and Requiring; obedientlie /
cannot be taught by the Word / nor through the Word / to the Kingdom of the
God of Heaven.

9. And therefore cannot such-a-one [which forsakes not it all / for the
Loues-cause of the Word / and taketh-vpp and bears his Cross / as also
followeth-after the Word reversed;in his Doctrine and Requiring; obedientlie]
be any Disciple of the Word / much-lesse then / an Elder or Minister of the
Word: For he understands not any-whit of all that which the Word is or
requires / in his Mystery / nether can he also speak or witness vprightlie
of the same.

NOTA.
But even Those which respect-well the Grace of the Lord / to Repentance /
and adioyne themselves obedientlie / to the Publisher and Minister of the Word
/ for to fulfill therein reversed;according to his Counsel or Doctrine; the
Requiring of the Word. Like as we have an Example thereof / of y^ holy
Apostle Peter, when as he witnessed the Word of Life / How that Certain
reversed;through the Hearing of the Testimonies of the Word / and of the
Promises of Salvation; adjoined themselves to Peter: and how that Those which
gladly received his Testimonies Act. ^. f.
did according to his Counsel and Doctrine / for to let themselves euenso be
helped or separated from the vnnurtered or unrepentant People. For so there was
a Difference made / in the Ministration of the Word / between Them that heard
the Word / and were obedient Disciples of the Word: and Those which heard
also the same / and were no obedient Disciples of the Word.

11. Therefore ought eueryone to take good-heede / how he hears and receaueth
the Word / which is this-day reversed;from God-his Grace; witnessed and
administered / through the holy Spirit of the Love of God the Father and his
Christ. For thatsame is the Word John. 6. g. ^. John. 1. a.
of Life / which was in times-past reversed;even ^il-vnto this Coming of his
glorious Manifestation; preached in the World. and that is also presently in
this Day reversed;euen-as there is promised and written thereof; com unto us from
y^ Righthand of God the Father / out of Heaven / for to execute Act. 10. c. 2.

might then euenso / in this Day of the righteous Judgment of Christ over

13. Those now therefore which do thus (as is before rehearsed) wholly
geeue-ouer themselves to become faithful and obedient Disciples / unto the
gracious Word and his Service of Love: and euenso utterly depart from their
old Possession and unprofitable Dealing / and forsake the same / as also
persevere firmlie till unto the End / in the Doctrine of the Word and of the

The XVI. Chapter.
^ow one shall deal with them that will not hear the Exho^tation / to their
Preseruation^ and the Warning from their Destruction / nor show any
Repentaunce^ but wax-malitious ther-against / and have their Fourth-going /
without the Requiring of the Word and Service of ^oue.

THere is said by certain: We have Sap^a. 4.
Documentall Sentences / that we should shewe-fourth the Love toward our
Neighbor / in his Falling into Sinne^ exhort him reversed;to his Preservation
in the Godlynes; unto the Amendment of his Life^ warn him of his Destruction^
take upon us his Sins / as Our-owne^ and healpe to bear his Burden: and
euenso reversed;with the Love; to cover his Sins.

2. Out of which Sayings we are occasioned to demand / whether we ought
also dutifullie / to show such Service of Exhortation / unto Preseruation^ and
such Warning from the Destruction / toward Those which obstinately turn
them away from the good Doctrine and Requiring of the Word / or which wax
much-worse at the Exhortation to their Preseruation^ and at the Admonition from
their Destruction / and so live without the Requiring of the Word and Service
of Love / and will not do nor shewe-fourth any Repentance for their Sins.
And thereunto is answered by HN and said:

3. O Ye Beloved / which have a Lust and good Will with us / to be
obedient-vnto or to fulfill the Requiring of the gracious Word and of his
Service of Love / have always an upright Respect or Consideration unto the
Word / and a right Diversity / betwixt Those that geeue-ouer themselves
reversed;to faithful Obedience; by the Elders in the Family of Love / unto
the Lord and his Word and Service of Love. bear Math. 3. Luke 3.
Sorrow for their Sins. make right Confession thereof. and shewe-fourth
upright Repentance / for their Sins. and become euenso implanted into the
gracious Word / or the Doctrine and Requiring of his Service of Love / for to
bring-fourth the good Fruits John. 15. a. Col. 1. a.
of the Word: And They that do not / nor-yet will do or shewe-fourth any
such Expressing of Good-willingnes / to the Requiring of the Word: but live
altogether according to y^ Counsel and Will of their Deuteronomy. 12. b.
Good-thinking / and turn them away from our Doctrine.

ye may well exhort them / that they apply themselves to the Obedience of y^
Requiring of the Word / and wholly geeue-ouer themselves to the Entra^nce of
the Doctrine and Requiring of the Service of Love.

5. For so long as Those which read or hear our Writings / do not humble
themselves / for to become implanted obedientlie into the gracious Word and the
Doctrine of his Requiring / Romans 12. ^. 1. Cor. 1^. c.
to Fellowe-members in the Body of Jesus Christ. but turne-away themselves
therfrom: and that also the Entrance to our Communialtie and Service of Love /
taketh-not-effect nor is consented-vnto by them / according to the Requiring of
the gracious Word / So are These reversed;although they bring-fourth much
Knowledge of the Word / and set-vp a Doctrine of their own / according to
their Hearts Good-thinking; not yeat become any Disciples nor Subjects of the
Word / nor-yet any Fellowe-members of the Body of Christ nor of his Family
of Love / nether-yet also any Fellowe-bretheren with us / in the Testamentes of
God and the holy Fathers.

6. SEeing then that the gracious Word / Genesis ^. b. Pro. ^. b.
Tree or Stock of Life / and that ye reversed;which have geeuen-ouer
yourselues to the Requiring of the Word / and to the Doctrine of his Service;
are implanted to the same Tree or Stock / for to bring-fourth ther-out good
Fruits of the Life / So are then also in (...) all they that are implanted to
the same Tree reversed;for to bring-fourth ther-out the good Frute^ of the Life;
your Fellowe-braunches Romans 11. ^.
in the same Tree. And not any Other.

7. And euenso in that part / ye all which are implanted to the gracious Word
and his Service of Love / for to be obedient / are also y^ upright Members of
the only Body of Christ, and upright Neighbors with each-other / which stand
serviceable one toward an-other / to Fruitfulnes of the good Fruits of the
upright Life.

8. Whosoever now therefore are incorporated into the gracious Word of the Life
and his Service of Love / to the Fulfilling of the first Schoole-rule of the
christian Doctrine / those shall also have a good Will / to bring-fourth the
good John. 15. a. Col. 1. a.
Fruits of the Life ther-out / and rejoice them that they find men serviceable
unto them thereto / and that warn them of the Destruction.

9. But verelie / Such as bide without the Entrance of the first Schoole-rule
of y^ christian Doctrine of the Service of Love / and euenso adioyne them in
Hypocrisy or Couerednes reversed;as with Any-seeking of their Selfnes / or of
their own Life or Lust; unto the Word or Service of Love / and so read or
hear the Testimonies and Writings of the Word: and then with their Knowledge
/ run off and on / from the Word and his Service / or-els besides the same /
go-fourth according to their old corrupted Understanding or Good-thinking /
and have nether Lust nor Will to y^ Requiring of the Word and his Service /
Those shall not be exhorted nor instructed any farther / then to the Heb. 10. d.
Entrance of the first Schoole-rule of y^ gracious Word and his Service of
Love. That is / to make-manifest their whole Heart by their Elder in the
Family of the Love of Jesus Christ. to shewe-fourth Repentance for Act. 2. f.
their Sins. and to geeue-ouer themselves obedientlie / to the Doctrine and
Requiring of the gracious Word and his Service of Love: and euenso to warn
them no farther / but of ye Destruction / which hangs over Them that bide
therwith-out / or turn them away therfrom.

10. If they now take the same Exhortation and Math. 3. a. Luke 3. a. Act. 2. f.
first School-rule of the Word / and let them be implanted reversed;to
Obedience; into the gracious Word and his Service of Love / for to
bring-fourth euenso ther-out / the good Fruits of the Life. But if not / so
shall they then (...) them away therfrom / and euenso reversed;through their
Disobedience and Unwillingness to the Entrance of the Sanctification of ye
Holyons of God; prepare themselves to Vessels of the Wrath of God / and Math.
25. d.
pluck or bring upon themselves ye Sentence of their Condemnation.

11. For they that are so goodthinking-wyse by themselves / that they
for-that-cause turn them away from us (...) euenso refuse / to become implanted
with us / (...) the gracious Word and his Doctrine / Those-same reversed;when
one requires them thereto; do all commonly turn them away / from the Service
of the Word / and from Those that require of them / the Obedience of the
Word: Yea they become also reversed;by that means; farre-worse then before /
and are turned-about to Blaspheamers of the Word and of the Elders in the
Communialtie of the Love: and of Leui. 10. Number. 16. 2. Tim. 3. ^.
such take ye good-heede / to thend that ye become not partakers of their
Destruction. And if they will not by any-meanes enter reversed;with you; at the
right Door John. 10. ^.
of the Sheepe-folde of Jesus Christ: but choose them an other Way / to breake-in
unto you / or that they likewise turn them away from us Elders^ and from our
Ministration of the Word and Requiring of the Service of Love / so turn you
then also away from them / and let them then hardly / depart from you: For
they are not of John. 10. c.
the Sheep of Christ or Family of his Love / much-lesse / Pastors or
Heardmen of the Sheep: and the gracious Word of the Lord / in his
serviceable flowen-fourth Waters or Documentes / together with the Ministration
of those-same / and the Ordinance of the Elders according to the Requiring of
y^ Word and his Service of Love / is also utterly reversed;in all; against the
Mind of their Opinion / and goodthinking Knowledge: For-that-cause also they
murmr so-much the-sooner / and wax-offended at the One or at the Other / and
so make an occasion / to depart from us / and to withdraw them from the
Obedience of the Requiring of the Service of the Love of Jesus Christ.

John has also spoken in his Epistle: 1. John. ^. d.
They are gon-away from us / but they were not of us: for had they ben of us /
so should they no-doubt have bidden by us: but they must beco^ manifest / that
they are not of us.

13. If any man then depart from us / or turn him away from us and from the
godly Obedience of the Word and of the Requiring of his Service of Love: or
that any-man do cleave to the Opinion of Those which are declyned from us and
our godly Doctrine / and euenso becomes an Enemy toward us and our
Doctrine / or a Blaspheamer / or Betrayer / and so waxes more-euell against
the Good that is showed on him / or takes all the same to the worst / and
interprets it in the euelst-part / Such-a-one verelie / was never rightly
adjoined nor implanted to y^ gracious Word nor his Service of Love: nether is
he also lighted by the Lord: nor-yet can he reversed;out of his malicious
Heart / nor out of his goodthinking Knowledge; Ie^. 8. b.
witness anything-at-all of the Truth of the Life.

14. And all Those which have their Fourth-going with such wicked or of-sundred
Minds / and will reversed;in no-case; any better / and so long as they rest of
that mind / they are assuredly not worthy of the Exhortation of Discipline /
to their Preseruation^ nor of the Warning from their Destruction. For / through
the Ignorance which is yeat in them / and through the Good-thinking which has
captiued them / they will not nether can they by any-meanes suffer / that the
Love or the Mercy should be showed on them / or that-men should deal
graciously reversed;to their Atonement with God and his Word / nor to
Unity of the Heart in the Service of the Love; toward them: but they frown
and byte at you^ or-els they deride and ieast-at you / when as ye are
serviceable unto them to the Good: and show therein their Lust to your
Destruction / or their Lust stands bent / to bring Us the Ministers of the
Word to reproch^ and that they might seduce Romans 16. ^.
and estraunge you from ye Word / and from the Obedience of his Doctrine.

Ephe. 4. c.
beare-with them in their Ignorance. For seeing that they are not entred-in
with us to the Beginning of the Christian Life: and that they have not any Lust
to the New Birth in Jesus Christ, nor to the Love of the holy Spirit /
nor-yet humble them obedientlie to the gra^ious Word and his Service of Love /
so is not sur^lie their Nature any otherwise.

16. Moreover / judge them not / nor yet publish-abrode their Sins / over
them: for they themselves bring-fourth their own Judgment with them. And
seeing that they are unwilling to the gracious Word and the Doctrine of his
Service / and resist the Grace of the same / which is proffered them is a
Leading-in to the gracious Word and his Service of Love / so do they
themselves make-manifest sufficiently / their own Sins and Errors / that
they are justly guilty of the Condemnation.

17. Therefore let noman take-in-hande / to teach such reversed;i^ their
Unwillingness; to the Kingdom of Heaven or inward spiritual Man of God: but
geeue them over or leave them to the Lord / and his righteous Judgment with
his Holyons: For in the same Judgment / eueryone shall reversed; Math. 25. d.
Romans 14. b. 2. Cor. 5. b.
according to his Works or Dooinges; receive his just Judgment / and his
right Recompense.

18. But ye all which are entered with us into the Math. 3. 7. Luke 3. 1^. Act.
3. c.
first Schoole-rule of the christian Doctrine of the Service of Love / and
cleave unto the gracious Word and the Doctrine of his Requiring / with all
your Heart / to Obedience / Use ye among each-other reversed;as concordable
Brethren and Sisters in the Love of our Lord Jesus Christ; your 1. Tess. 5. b.
Heb. 3. 10. d.
Exhortation / to one-an-others Preseruatio^^ and your Warning / from
one-an-others Destruction: Ephe. 4. ^.
and growe-vp euenso ^ with the Word / and in the Word; in all Love and
Godlynes: and have not much Prate or Disputation with the Strangers / nor with
them that fall-away from the Service of Love / nor with the Vnwillingons and
Resisters.

Let euery-one take this effectually to heart.
The XVII. Chapter.
There is demanded: Which is the Destruction / whereof the Etraungers to the
Howsholde or Family of the Love of Jesus Christ / are to be warned: and which
is also the Destruction / that the Disciples of the Word and the upright
Brothers in the Love of Jesus Christ / are deptours to warn one-an-other of.
And thereunto is answered by HN and said:

(...). 3. 1^. 19. 1. Gla. 4. 2. Gla. 7. 21. 3. Gla. ^. 4. Gla. 1. etc.
witnessed and setfourth very-much in all our Writings / were it but
understood or comprehended a-right. Nevertheless / seeing that there is yet
presently farther demanded thereof / we will [to the end that eueryone may take
the Admonition reversed;in having the greater regard thereunto; so-much the
more or better to heart] utter or declare-fourth with uncovered Words / the
principal Head-pointes of both their Destructions.

2. The Destruction of the Strangers to the Family of the Love of Jesus
Christ, wher-through they (if one warned them not thereof / or if they
reversed;when they are warned; turn them not about / for to be obedient to the
Doctrine and Requiring of the gracious Word of the Lord and of his Service of
Love) should utterly perrish / and inherit the eternal Condemnation or
Bannishment / is this:

3. First / they should all / which hold themselves ^s Strangers unto the
Doctrine and Requiring of the Obedience of the gracious Word and of his
Service of Love reversed;if one warned them not of their Destruction; ^ide
always reversed;with their Darkness or ^. Cor. 3. d.
Covering of the old Man; utterly covered or separated / from the Face of the
living God of Heaven and of his Christ, which is presently in the last time
reversed;through God-his Grace; appeered unto us in naked uncovered Cleernes /
under the Obedience of the Love of Jesus Christ^ and declared with the Fulness of
his Grace and Mercy. and which also / all Disciples of the Word reversed;in
the Ephe. 4. c.
Laying-away of the Coueringes of the old Man; shall in like-maner behold
naked and uncovered / as 1. Cor. 13. c. 2. Cor. 3. b.
from Face to Face / in the essential Cleernes of God and Christ.

4. Secondly / they should through their herited John. 3. ^.
Water or Doctrine of the gracious Word and of his Service of Love / even
until the Romans 6. b. c.
Death and Buryall of Jesus Christ, to the Slaying and Burying of the old Man /
and of his corrupted Understanding / Lust / and Desires: and that they be not
euenso then borne again / out of the Spirit of the gracious Word / even unto
y^ upright Being of Jesus Christ) fall into manifold Errors and Seducinges /
and utterly perrish therein.

5. Thirdly / they should also reversed;if they be not wholly withdrawn from
the Works and Lusts of Ephe. 4. b. ^
the old Man^ and euenso taught and prepared to the New Birth in Jesus Christ;
bide always Members of the Deuell and his ungodly Being* and minded to all
Destruction and Error / and obtain no John. 13. a.
Part nor Inheritance in the holy Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, nor in the
Kingdom Math. 13. ^.
of Heaven: nor yet likewise in any Treasures of the spiritual and heavenly
Goods.

6. Fourthlie / they should (if they be not reversed;to the Mortifying and
Burying of all ungodly Being; implanted Romans 6.
into the gracious Word or Body of Jesus Christ) bide evermore in Error /
without the gracious Word or Body of Jesus Christ, and not be driven or
directed any otherwise / then by the Spirits of Errours^ and taught by the
many-maner 3. Reg. 22. c.
Spirits of Lies (whether it were then to false Spiritualnes / Doctrine / or
Religion: or-els to the Disorderlynes or Iniquity of the World) and should
likewise also for-that-cause-sake / not be able to understand, know, nor
obtain or receive / the holy Spirit of God and of the Truth or Christ:
nor-yet feel or perceive anythinge-at-all thereof: nether-yet of the Grace of
the Lord / how large the same reaches over the Children of Men / or how
neere-by it is unto them.

7. Verelie / all these Strangers unto the Family and Service of the Love /
or Such as go-fourth according to their Good-thinking / stand comprehended or
are bewrapped in a great Destruction: and whosoever makes the same known unto them
/ and so warns them thereof / er-euer ye great Destruction take them cleene
away and destroy them / in their Error and Estraunging / he does very-well
/ and shows a great Good-deede of Love and Mercy toward his Neighbor. And
if they then convert them to the gracious Word of the Lord / and to the
Doctrine of his Service. make Confession of their Sins. and Luke 13. b.
shewe-fourth Repentance / So shall then their Souls be won to the eternal
Life^ and to the everlasting Preservation in the Godlynes.

Brothers and Sisters in the Family of the Love of Jesus Christ / shall warn
one-an-other / is this*

9. If it chance that any of the Disciples of the Word / or of the Brethren
or Sisters in the Family of the Love of Jesus Christ / should reversed;without
the Doctrine or Requiring of the Word and his Service; fall into any
Good-thinking / or into any-sort of Dealing / contrary to the Doctrine or
Requiring of the Word and his Service (whether it were then out of himself /
or-els through any Strangers or Offallenons) or that they should be assaulted
/ for to turn them away from the 2. Cor. 11. ^.
Singlemindednes of Life which we have in the gracious Word (wherein ye are
also taught and exercised aright to the same Singlemindednes) so shal-men then
warn those of the Destruction / which is witnessed heere-following. And if
they then take not to heart the Warning for y^ avoiding of their Destruction:
but turne-away themselves from the Word and from the Doctrine of his Service
/ through the Assaulting or Temptation which meets them to that effect / and
mar or deprave themselves again in any Good-thinking and Self-wisdom^ or in
any brutish or worldly Being / and euenso estraunge them from the good
Doctrine of the Word / so should then the same verelie chance unto them / to a
damaigefull Destruction.

10. For first / there should reversed;by that occasion; a Covering of the Wrath
of God / enter-in betwixt them and God / and the Doctrine of his gracious
Word: in such-sort / that they should not be able to hear nor understand /
Esa. 6. c. Math. 13. b. Act. 28. c.
what God requires through his gracious Word and Service of Love. Of this
Destruction here mentioned / shall the Disciples of the Word warn one-an-other
to thend that the-l^ke com not upon them


11. Secondly / their Good-thinking or their Pleasure in the Fleash or in the
carthlie Things / should also estraunge them from the pure Beauty of the
heavenly Being / and so bring them into greater Error of Destruction / then
that wherein they walked before.



13. One should in like-maner much less or worsser / be able to make them to
know their Error and Destruction / for to rid them therout / then in
times-past / when as they yeat stood in their first Blindness or Error.

14. Fourthlie / they should also through the Incorporating-againe into the
Deuell / and through their Addicting of them to the earthly consumeable
Things / be driven by the wicked Spirit of the good-thinking, earthly,
fleashlie, and deuelish Being / in greater Presumption and with more Freenes /
into the Falshod / against God and his holy Spirit and Service of Love / then
he had driven them in times-past: And that altogether / to cause them to invay
or be against the good Doctrine of the Word and the Ministration of the same:
yea / and to a plucking of the Destruction over themselves / and also over
other more.

15. Thissame is verily the Destruction / of the which all the Disciples of the
Word and of the Doctrine of his Seruice^ and all Brethren and Sisters in the
Family of the Love of Jesus Christ / shall warn one-an-other: And for that
cause reversed;for to bide kept from the same Destruction; let eueryone apply
himself so-much the dilligenter to the Doctrine and Requiring of the Word /
and so-much the heartelyer exhort one-an-other to bide steadfast in the Doctrine
and Requiring of the Word / even to the End.

The XVIII. Chapter.
There is demanded / how the upright Brethren shall behave themselves /
toward Such as also go-fourth as Brethren / and have gotten and read some
part of the Writings of the Family of the Love of Jesus Christ / and yet will
not make-manifest themselves reversed;for to be incorporated into the
Communialtie of the same Family of the Love; by the Elders. but run
hethe^-and-thether with the Writings or with the Knowledge out of the same /
among the Brethren / and among other more / for to teach them / with their
Knowledge / or to pluck them to the Knowledge of their Mind. And thereunto is
answered by HN and said:

VErelye / Then that com-on unto Romans 16. c.
besides the good Doctrine which is taught you to the Entrance of the upright
Life: and also besides the good Doctrine which becomes yeat daily taught unto
you / to Ephe. 4. b.
the Growing-vpp in the holy Understanding of the Godlynes of the holy Spirit
of the Love of Jesus Christ.

2. Oh alas / over those we have to lament us very-much: for They are the 2.
Gla. 23. b c 4. Gla. 23. c.
false Brethren / which euery-wheare slip-in reversed;with their goodthinking
Knowledge; besides the good Doctrine of the gracious Word and of his upright
Service / and enter not in by the right John. 10.
Door of the Sheep-folde / to the Sheep of Christ or of the Family of his
Love / nor by the right Entrance to the John. ^. a.
New Birth in Jesus Christ: but break^-in through some other way / and euenso
seek their own private Commodity and the Honor of themselves / at Men's
hands / and not the Salvation of Men: and for their own Ease and Peaces cause
in the Fleash / they know also well how to hold themselves reversed;after y^
Aspect or Pleasing of Men / and according to the Measuring-fourth of their
Knowledge; as Teachers and 2. Cor. 11. c.
Appostles of the Word: they know also somtymes how to prate and talk
at-large of high heavenly Mattiers / which yet they have never seen / but
have taken-on such a Knowledge thereof to themselves. Howbeit / they desire not
to make-manifest the Uncleanness of their Hearts / nor-yet reversed;in
Repentance for their Sins; to be purged ther-of: but they cloak or cover
the same / and yet will nevertheless reversed;with their unclean ungodly
Hearts; esteem themselves to be ^^^uall with the Righteous.

3. Of which / and over which / the upright Propheates / Teachers / and
Appostles of the Word / have ever very-sore complained them / that Esa. 2^.
56. d. Ier. 14. c. 23. a c. d. 50. b. c. Eze. 13. 34. Oze. 4. 5. 9. b John. 10.
a. Romans 16. c. 2. Cor. 11. ^. 2. Tess. 3. a. b. 2. Tim. 3. a. Tit. 1. c. 2.
Pet. 2. a. c.
such false Brethren and Teachers / know how to breake-in always so
subtillie / between the upright Doctrine of the holy Word and the
singlemynded Brethren: yea and also obtain the greatest Estimation among
Many / and draw likewise many Unfaithful unto them. But they themselves
bring therein y^ Sentence of their Punishment with them / wherein both they and
such as follow them reversed;in their Error and Fourth-going; destroy
themselves / like as the holy Propheates and Appostles of the holy Word /
have figured-fourth and witnessed their Judgment / Punishment / and
Destruction^ together with their Falshod and Seducing / in many Places of the
holy Scripture. and warned all goodwilling Hearts to the upright Righteousness
/ of them and of such-like^ and of their Destruction.

4. And we ourselves also have mentioned the-like 2. Gla. 23. b. 4. Gla. 23. c.
Writings / to the end that now likewise / in this perrelous Time [wherin all
Falshod / Seducing / and Deceit reversed;to the Destruction of Men; bears so
great sway] eueryone which reversed;under the Obedience of the Love; loves the
Righteousness with us / should be warned of the Falshod and Deceit of the false
Bretheren^ and of Such as take upon them out of themselves / to administer any
Doctrine reversed;besides the Doctrine of the gracious Word and Service of
Love; unto anyone: and also of them / which turne-away themselves from Us and
from the Woorde^ and from our mostholie Service of the Love / and can yet
nevertheless highly and at large prate of the Word and the Love. But they
themselves enter not into the Beginning of the christian Doctrine of the Service
of the Woorde^ nor into the upright Being of the Love: nether-yet also
endeavor them thereunto / to passe-thorowe the Luke 13. c.
small Way / which leads to the Life of the Ephe. 4. c.
upright Righteousness.

5. And therefore / to the end that now in this perrelous Time / the right
Entrance to the upright Righteousness / might be the-lightlier knowen^ and the
Deceit of the false Brethren reversed;which enter not into the same;
the-better eschewed: and that they might be preserved therfrom / So is
presently in this Day reversed;through the gracious Word and his Service of
Love; the right John. 10.
Door of the Sheep-folde of the upright Sheep or Brethren of the Family of
Love / or the right Entrance to the New Birth in Jesus Christ
reversed;wher-thorowe all upright Sheep / Teachers / and Appostles of the
holy Word do enter-in / to the upright Being of Jesus Christ and his Love;
figured-fourth and expressed distinctlie and nakedlie unto us / without the
which / all Unbelievers of the Word / and all Hypocrites and false Brethren /
with all false Teachers or Appostles / byde-remayning: and have not any lust /
to go through the same.

6. And although they dissembled never so-much / as pretending to go therein or
ther-thorowe with you / yet can they not reversed;if they in the Obedience of
the Requiring of our mostholie Service of y^ Love / love not with all their
Heart the upright Being of Jesus Christ; persevere therein to the End / that
they might be saved: but they turn them away / either to the right Side or to
the leaft / and com not to the true Being of Jesus Christ reversed;wherein
notwithstanding the upright Knowledge of the Mystery of God and of the
heavenly Kingdom / together with the spiritual and heavenly Goods are
obtained or purchased; that they might inherit the same / in their Spirit and
Mind.

7. For-that-cause we tell you yeat presently / Math. 3. Luke 3.
first Schoole-rule of the christian Doctrine^ nor to the John. 3.
New Birth in Jesus Christ, nor-yet to Such as bide not steadfast therein / to
Faithfulnes^ nether-yet account them for upright Brethren / much-lesse then /
for Teachers or Ministers of the Word. For they that make not manifest
themselves / before their Elder in the holy Understanding of the gracious
Word / nor confess the Error of their former Life and Understanding / before
him / nor yet do nor shewe-fourth any Repentance for their Sins / have not
any good in their mind / whether they acknowledge it or acknowledge it not.

8. If they then appear not or make not manifest themselves in that place /
where the Sun the heavenly Daylight shyneth / and where the John. 7. d.
Fountain of the safe-making Water flows / and euenso hold not themselves
steadfastly / by the clear Shyning of the heavenly Day-light^ nor by the
daily Out-flowing of the safe-making Water / nor become daily refreashed and
washed with the outflowing healthsom Waters / till that they reversed;in their
Spirit and Mind; be borne-anew / out of the holy John. 3. ^.
Spirit of the Love of Jesus Christ, but / before they have attained to the same
Time / runne-away with some flowen-fourth Water / and that they suppose euenso
to bide covered / in their inward, filthye, and stinking Ie^. 2. c.
Poole or Pit / or-yet to purge themselves / without the pure Water that
flows out of our Pitcher^ and from our Body / So shall it not then verelie
avail them / to the Life of Righteousnes^ nor the unclean stinking Poole of
