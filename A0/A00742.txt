THE SACRED DOCTRINE OF DIVINITY, GATHERED OVT OF the word of God. Together
with an explication of the LORDS PRAYER.



1599.

A preface to the Christian Reader.
I ENTERED no sooner into meditation of some preface unto the present book, but
forthwith Master Dudley Fenner, of most happy and worthy memory, stood
before me. In whose remembrance, as his death renewed my grief: so it comforted
me, that after three years, as it were the third day, in one of the same
country of Kent, in the same argument of laying down the whole body of the
holy doctrine of God, in the same method and memorielike handling of it, God
had as it were, raised him up again from the dead, for supply of some of that
worthy service, unto his Church, which he, if the Lord had added years unto
his life, would manifoldly have performed. For considering the forrestlike
largeness of matter it handles and small rowme the same is imparked, and the
good order every doctrine stands in before the reader, ranged with others
either going before and coming after, as superiors and inferiors, or siding
it and walking hand in hand, as sisters and companions: it seemed to me, that
this treatise was like to be a seed, that by the hand of the printer being cast
upon the field of our country, might in good time bring us home an harvest,
that might yield honor to God, and edification to his Church, which is the
principal: and in the second place some honest credit, not altogether to be
despised, unto this our country of Kent, whilst it going before the most of
other the Shires and Counties of the Land in blessings of outward
fruitefulnesse and wealth, should not be found behind all others, in the
fruits of the Spirit, wherewith men's hearts, yea the Lord himself (after a sort)
is rejoiced. I^ li^. 9.
And in it me thought I saw some gracious blush and good resemblance of the
wisdom, which Solomon speaks of. For as by writing she lifts up her
voice, Prove. 8.
so by convenient, orderly and easy manner of ha^dling the doctrines of God,
she stands in the top of the highest places, where all wayfaring men that
are strangers in our country, taking their voyage toward mount Sion, may
understand what is said unto them. From thence she steppeth to set her self
in the place or mother of ways: Ezech. 2*
where one way cutting it self into many, greatly hazardeth the wayfaring man,
unless there be one, as it were, with the finger to point unto him, which is
the right and ready way. Approaching unto the city of the heavenly Jerusalem,
from whence soever he comes East, West, North or South, and to whatsoever of
the twelve gates of the twelve tribes of our Land: she is there also ready at
the gate, in the mouth of the City, to tell him, what streat he shall enter,
on what hand to turn, what lane to go down. That done she takes the wings
of the morning, and fearing the frailty of men, least they should not see their
happiness, when it is before them, or that they should not discern of it,
when they touch it, or stumble upon it: she sets her self even at the very
door that opens to the full and perfect possession of the promised felicity,
saying, here is the place you seek after, enter it. This commendation,
notwithstanding that inco^parably it does agree to the eternal son of God,
in his own, and in his Prophetical, and Apostolical ministry, as that which
is the perfect Iethro of our voyage from Th'aegipt of this world unto the Land
of the heavenly Canaan: yet may it also not unfitly, in some measure, more or
less, be spoken of the holy labors in this kind: which by description of the
whole doctrine of God, from the foundation unto the loouer thereof, take us by
hand, and entering us into the way of God, lead us as it were to all the
standinges and Camping places of the children of God, in the wilderness of
this world, until having cast away, either weapons or walking staves, we shall
set us down in th'endles peace and rest of our God. A labor as at no time
unseasonable, and in no place unworthy of a good welcome: so in these days,
and especially in our country, it is worthy, of all good entertainment. For
beside that there are to many sects and schisms: there are also diversities
of judgments, in one and the same sort, both which be in danger, the former of
schisms to grow to heresies, the latter from some difference of judgment, to
be sorted and sected altogether, if by such treatises as this, which shortly,
and, as it were under one sight, lay forth the sound doctrine of all the maine,
and mean, principal, and secondarie points of our most holy faith, the
judgment of men be not either called home, where it is broken out, or stayed
where a breach is begun. And albeit th'excellent use hereof may clearly appear
to every one that has but half an eye to look with: yet is there that
opposition in the world against all good endeavors of the servants of the God
of heaven, that this also is not unlike to fall into some riflers hands, which
will do the uttermost of his wretched endeavor, to despoile it of the
garments of comelines, whereby the Lord would set it in the good grace and
well liking of his children. If (happily) it be said, that it is therefore
fruitles, because it is a doing of a thing that is already done, by a worthy,
workman of the Lord Master Dudley Fenner, it were sufficient answer, that
the same is made English, which before was Latin, and brought into the
artificers shop, which was before in the studies and closets of the learned
alone, which deserves praise at the hands of a thankful Reader. It is more
then sufficient answer, that he has brought Mr Fenners book, for help of
memory, into a great deal smaller rowme. But I am and have been of that
acquaintance and priuitie with the Gentlemen these many years, that I am able
before God, and in truth to profess, that before he ever saw M. Fenners
book, he had written and finished this; with such grace, as I, loving him
before, did ever sithence reverence him, for the graces of God bestowed upon
him. And therefore as the Lord gave Master Fenner the honor to be first; so
he would not let him have it so far, as to be alone. And notwithstanding
the authors both modesty, and wisdom is such, as he would not have passed by
the advantage of a further garnishment of his work, by M. Fenners labors: yet
whosoever shall peruse the book diligently, shall easily perceive, that he
has for the matter, a stock of his own, and for the form and manner of
delivery of it, art and cunning of his own, to have finished some commendable
work in this kind, if he had had no such pattern before his eyes. Which being
well considered, will stop the mouth of some others, which snatching up the
wise Proverbs, as of a man not meddling beyond his slipper: and a Carpenter not
dealing but with his chippes: will be ready, foolishlie to throw them, they
know not where, nor at whom. And for my part, I am of that judgment, that it
is so far from being unmeet for a Gentleman of the Innes of the Court, to
deal thus in these holy studies; that I could wish of the Lord, that the
Noble men of the Court it self, and all others whose wits are either by
nature, or education more pregnant, would fine and file them upon such
endeavors as these are. So should they fit themselves not only to pass from
the Princes Court into the Lords own Court, there to reign for evermore; but
should able themselves ten thousand times better to all honorable services of
their Prince, and Country, in a wiser and more politic government of the
common wealth, then Machiauel that cursed helhound can furnish the^ of. For
besides many notable draughts of policy, here and there scattered throughout
the whole Scripture, especially the story: that one book of the Proverbs, as
it were the Lords own Politickes, is able to yield more sound precepts of
sure and safe government, then, I will not say Machiauell, but then all the
Machiauels in the world, when they shall have met upon their bench, and shall
have beaten out their brains about that consultation. And if it be here asked,
what are you, or who are you, whose judgment in this behalf the reader should
so greatly regard. Peradventure the reader may be such a one, as if I were a
man of some mark, with my word I should carry him away, although I brought no
reason: if of no note at all, he would not believe me, although I should come
upon him with never so good reason. Therefore concealing my name, in a word I
answer first out of Moses, for whom, when Joshua was ielous least the gift of
Prophecy, and of the declaration of the will of God being common, Moses his
Master should be less esteemed: he answered, would to God that all the Lords
people were Prophets, Number. 11.
why lest the Lord should bestow his Spirit upon them. Example hereof we have
in Ezechias reign, one of the godliest and most renowned Kings that ever
reigned, whose government was also accompanied with as much glory and good
success, both at home, and abroad during the whole time of his reign, as any
king whatsoever, David only excepted. Nay I needed not, in every respect, to
have excepted David, who met with more cross hands of the Lord in his Sons
and subjects, then ever did Ezechias. And of him to his commendation that shall
never die, it is written, that his Courtiers gathered, Pro. 25. ^
and suited diverse of: Solomon's Proverbs, in that Prophetical order wherein now
they are left unto us by the holy Ghost. And unless Courtiers will judge
themselves unworthy of the kingdom of heaven, there is no cause, why they
should esteem it to base or to unworthy a thing for them to be occupied in:
seeing David, Solomon and Ezechias, the most famous Kings that ever lived,
have no one thing so precious, to garnishe and set forth their Royal Crown
with, as that their hands being taught of God to write some thing to his
praise, and edification of his people, the same as a diamond in their princely
Diademes remains to all posterity. Saul also, albeit a wicked man, yet
being purposed of God to the Kingdom, had this as a principal means, to
hide from the eyes of the people, the baseness of his birth, and homelines of
his education: that he was for some small time graced of the Lord with a gift
of Pro phetie, wherewith being ennobled, he was so prepared for the kingdom.
But I am ashamed of the iniquity of these times, that should drive to the
proof of that, which profane and heathnish me^, in the dim and dark sight
of their natural reason, have both seen and professed, that these common
wealths were most happy, where either Philosophers were Kings, or Kings
Philosophers. And if Scepters were well guided, when men stood at the stern of
common wealths, that stirred them by direction of that shadow and carcass of
Philosophy, that was to be had in their books: O how happily should they
be menaged, if their course were set at the prescript and command of the word
of God, which is the lady mistres of all true wisdom or philosophy. But I
see there would be no end if I should set my self to answer whatsoever the
crooked wits of wrangling companions might object. And therefore assured of the
fruitfulness of the book in it self, I commend the profit and succes thereof
to the blessing of God: who only can direct the hearts and hands of men to
lay houlde, and make use of it, as well for the increase of their knowledge, as
for the provoking of them to like endeavors. 1. Ianuar. 1589.

The sacred Doctrine of Divinity, gathered out of the word of God.
Theology, or, the first book of Divinity, concerning God.
Chap. 1. Of God: The Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.
Divinity is a doctrine of Gods glory the end of Predestination (both
reprobation, Proverb. 16. 4. and election, Ephe. 1. 5, 6.)

Of the Creation and Administration of al things, Romans 11. 36. Of all benefits
obtained in Christ, 2 Cor. 1. 20.

Of all our actions, 1. Cor. 10. 31.


glorifying God, whereof there be 2 Chro. 28. 9. Psalm. 100. 2, 3.
two parts, For the better understanding of the unlearned, it may be divided
thus: Whereof there be two parts, One that entreats of God: The other of
yielding al duty to him.
Theology and Religion.

Theology is the first part of Divinity concerning God. (...)

God is that infinite God is perfection it self, that is to say: A most single
spiritual nature, Ioh 4. 24. all being essential in him, and nothing
accidental Esa, 43. 25. The cause of his own perfection and of every good and
perfect gift in other, Iam. 1. 17. which perfection stands in an infinitenes
of goodness, Mat. 19. 17. Wisdom, Romans 11. 33. Power, Genesis 17. 1. Eternity,
Reu. 1. 8. Immensitie. Ier. 23. 24. And has all things of imperfection removed
from it. 2. Tim. 2. 13. Tit. 1. 2 Iam. 1. 13.
perfection, whose being is Exodus 3. 14. John 8. 58.
of himself.

The Godhead, notwithstanding the Deuteronomy. 6. 4. 1 Cor. 8. 4.
unity of the essence, receives a distinction of Hag. 2. 5, 6. Mat. 28. 19.
1. Ioh. 5. 7.
persons.

A person is Colos. 2. 9 And therefore subsisting from all eternity.
the Godhead John. 1. 1. John 5. 31. 37. John. 14. 16.
diversely Heb. 1. 3.
subsisting. And John 14. 26. John 15. 26.
sends forth, or proceeds.

Sending forth are those persons from whom another person proceeds: as the
Father and the Son. The Father is a person which John 1. 18. Col. 1. 15.
has begotten the Son.

The Son is a person begotten of the Father.

Proceeding is that person which is sent out of the former, namely the holy
Ghost, who is the Romans 8. 9, 11.
Spirit of them both.

Chapter 2. Of the purpose of God.
God being thus in his nature and persons most glorious, has further glorified
himself by two notes of excellency which he takes to him, Psalm. 93. Math. 6

King dome and Honor. Kingdom is that whereby he dispenses all The
dispensation of God reaches to every thing in heaven and in earth, Psalm.

Actions of mercy and kindness, Psalm. 33. 5. and 119. 64. Of Judgment and
vengeance, Amos 3. 6. Lamen. 3. 37. 38. Esaias 45. 7. Of chastisement and
correction, Psalm. 89. 33. 34. Iere. 12. 3. Heb. 12. ^6. And lastly sinful
and wicked actions, Acts 4. 27, 28. himself remaining without all touch of

between the persons themselves, is 1 Cor 8. 6. Heb. 1. 2 Job 26 13.
from the Father in the Son by the holy Ghost: To 1 Cor. 12. 11.
who^ is attributed the immediate dispensing of them.

The kingdom of God is in his Ephe. 1. 11.
purpose and works.

Purpose is his decree Acts 15. 18. One principal branch whereof is
Predestination, that is to says his foreappointment of every Angel and man
either unto salvation, 1 Timothy 5. 21. Ephesians. 1. 4. Romans 8. 29 and 9. 23. or
damnation. Math. 25. 41. Jude verse 4. Romans 9. 22. and also of the measure of
it (more or less) unto them both, Math. 20. 23. Jude 4. Acts 1. 25. This
foreappointment to salvation, is called Election. That to damnation is called
Reprobation. One being to the praise of the glory of his mercy, Romans 9. 23.
Ephesians. 1. 6. The other to the praise of the glory of his Justice, Romans 9. 22.
Both proceeding from the only will and pleasure of God, for causes unknown
unto us, but yet most just and holy, Romans 9. 18. Math. 11. 26.
before all times of every thing.

Chapter 3. Of Creation.
THe works of God are the By an inevitable necessity, Ezech. 12. 25. Psalm
33. 8. Number 23 19. He having all the Creatures at his command 1. Kings 22 19.

property of the second causes remain, and the eue^ts of things are termed
such as the second causes are. Continngent if the second causes be

execution of his purpose. And are Creation and Government. Creation is his
Genesis 1. The order of the Creation was thus: First God made of nothing an empty
and unformed lump (called Heaven and Earth, because it was the first matter of
them both:) verse. 1. 2. Secondly, out of that lump he beautifully framed, 1.
The simple bodies called the four Elements, that is to say Fire (for that is
to be understood in light an adioint and quality of the fire) set in the
globe of Heaven. The first day. 3, 4, 5. Air, or all that void place between
the clouds and the earth, giving Breath of life to all things that breath: The
second day, 6, 7, 8. Water, caused to retire to his proper channels, the Seas,
the floudes, the lakes, the springs, etc. and Earth, left alone all other
being sent into their places. 9, 10. Then the compound bodies, made by the
uneven mixture of the former, in this sort: 1. Those without life, as well
earthly bodies, both Grass for the use of Beasts. And Trees for the use of
Man, the third day, 11, 12, 13. as heavenly bodies, the vessels of light,
(from whose influence the former have their growth) both great ones, the Sun
and Moon: and small ones, as the Stars, whereinto he did gather the light
that before was scattered in the whole body of the Heavens, the fourth day, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Secondly those that have a life, whether a sensitive or
feeling life only, as Fishes made specially of the water. Birds, made
specially of the air, the fifth day, 20, 21, 22, 23. and Beasts, both going
and creeping made specially of the earth, 24, 25. or a reasonable Soul and
Life also, that is to say, Man in both sexes Male and Female, viz. Adam and
Eve, the sixth day, 26, 27.
making all things of nothing. Which of Genesis 1. 31.
every Creature was in excellency of perfection.

Chapter 4. Of Government.
Government is his Ephe. 1. 1^.
administering of every thing.

Chap. 5. Of the Honor due to God.
SO much of the Kingdom of God: The Honor due unto him, is, that al his
reasonable creatures (Men and Angels) Math. 6. 10. And that for his own sake
only without any respect of our own good. Wherein it differs from the
treatise of righteousness, coming after. Which is always coupled with a
respect of our own bliss and happiness. As our Savior in that prayer does
distinguish these things.
do with cheerefulnes his revealed will in all things.

The second Book of Divinity concerning the Law.
Chapt. 1. Of Righteousness, and the blessedness belonging to it.
ANd this shortly is the su^me of Theology, or of that doctrine which touching
God is revealed unto us. Religion is the second part of Divinity, concerning
righteousness.

Righteousness is the reasonable creatures Gal. 3. 1^.
fulfilling of all duties to God. Whereunto of his Luc. 17. 10.
free goodness, a reward of Leuit. 18. 5. Math. 19. 17.
blessedness does belong: As the Angels had a greater measure of righteousness
and blessedness, then Adam, and Adam then Lue 1. Tim. 2. 13.
more or less, according to the measure of righteousness.

Blessedness is their perfect good. And stands in the 1. John. 1. 3.
fruitio^ of Gods love, or (from thence coming) a conjunction and communion
with him.

Conjunction is the enjoying of his Math. 18. 10.
personal presence.

Communion is a Genesis 1. 26. Coloss. 3. 10.
Participation (in some sort) of his excellency: namely Math. 6. 13.
Dignity and Dominion.

Dignity is an excellency of person above all other creaturs. Both for Luke.
9. 26.
glory (wherein wisdom and virtues of the mind are comprehended) and Psalm.
103. 20.
power.

Dominion is a Genesis 1. 26. Heb. 2. 7, 8. Colos. 1. 16.
sovereignty over all other creatures.

Chapt. 2. Of Righteousness in nature, desire and will.
The whole doctrine of righteousness is perfectly comprehended in the ten
Commandments for the better understanding of which Commandments take
these few rules. 1. A figurative speech in every one, commanding or forbidding
more the^ is expressed. 2 They are spiritual, binding not the outward man
only, but all the powers of the soul: the understanding, judgment, memory,
will, affections. 3. They require perfect obedience, commanding all good,
forbidding all evil. 4. In commanding, or forbidding anything, they command
or forbid all means thereunto. 5. Commanding one thing, they forbid the
contrary: forbidding one thing, they command the contrary.
Righteousness is in 1. These. 5. 23.
Nature and Action. Righteousness in Nature is a right inclination of al
original powers.

Righteousness in action is a right framing of all actions proceeding from those
powers. And is of the desire only, or of the will also.

That of desire only, is a right framing of all inward motions before consent.

The other of will also, is a right framing of al actions unto the which
consent is come.

Chap. 3. Of cleaving unto God.
THus much of the things in common apperteining. The parts of Righteousness
are To 1. 18. Tit. 2. 11.
Piety and Justice.

The first Table. The duties whereof are greater then the duties of the
second Table, comparing like degrees, as moral duties of the one, with moral
of the other (not ceremonial of the first Table, with the moral of the
second.) The chief middle and least duties of the former with the like of the
latter: deeds with deeds: words with words: thoughts with thoughts: and not
otherwise. For if you compare murder with the least abuse of the name of God,
or adultery with the least breach of the Sabbath, those are the greater sins.
Piety is the immediate duties to God. And is inward or outward.

The first Commandment.
Inward with all our Math. 22. 37. 38.
powers to cleave unto God. Deu. 6. 5.
Loving, Leu. 19. 14.
fearing, Number. 20. 12.
believing, Psalm. 22. 5, 6.
trusting, and Psalm. 38. 8.
hoping in him.

Chapt. 4 Of Worship.
The second commandment.
OVtward; is the worshipping of him Deuteronomy 12. 32. Mat. 15. 9. 2 Chro. 15. 13
Exodus 23. 13. Note the opposition in the second commandment, of them that
love me and keep my commandementes, to these words, Thou shall not make any
graven image.
according to his commandment. As in Psa. 50. 15.
prayer, both petition and thankesgiuinge, Este. 9. 17, 18, 20, 31. Zach. 8 19.
feasts of thankfulness for his benefits: 1 Pet. 3. 15. Romans 10. 10.
open profession of ones faith: Deuteronomy. 6. 13.
oaths, Psalm. 50. 12.
vows, Nehe. 10. 30.
curses, and the like.

Chap. 5. Of Reverence.
TO the worship of God two things do belong, Reverence and a holy reast.

The third commandment.
Reverence is a most Deuteronomy. 28. 58. Number. 30. 2.

Holy rest is the sanctifying of one day in seaue^ to his service. By Act. 15.
22. and 20. 7.
public exercises of the Church, and private Revel. 1. 10.

Chap. 12. Of Contentednes.
THis is vprightnes: The tenth commaundment.

So I interpret it for these reasons following.

1 The plain evidence of the words Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house.

2 By conference of the rest of the commaundments, Honor thy Father and thy
Mother: Thou shall not kill: Thou shall not cemmit adultorie: thou shall not
steal: Thou shall not bear false witness: which have (all of them) a common
and familiar understanding, such as every man at the first hearing does
conceive. 3 The particular instances. Thy neighbors house, wife, manseruant,
maydeseruant, ox, ass, or any thing that is his, declare manifestly the good
things of ones person to be the proper subject of this commandment. For which
cause Exodus 20. 17. the wife of our neighbor (his most precious possession,
prou. 19. 14) comes not in the first place but is set in ye midst of other
possessions, that the very marshaling of the words it might appear that this
commandment reaches not to uncleanness. 4 The order of the commandments,
going by degrees from the greater to ye less, and so continually falling til
you come to this sum of Coveting, which is the root of all the rest, 1. Tim.
6. 10. 5 It differs in nature from the two last that went before. Whereof one
is bent against injury and wrong, the other against falsitie and deceit. And
this comes not so far as either of them both. Lastly, add hereunto that
which I hold as a certain ground, that the corruption both of nature and
desire is forbidden in every one. For the Law of God, and consequenthe every
commandment thereof, being spiritual, Romans 7. 14. (according to the nature of
him that gave it, John 4 24. Heb 4. 12. 13.) must needs reach to all the
faculties and powers of the whole man, yea and to his very nature. So as in
every commandment the root it self and stumpe of that sin, together with
all the branches coming from it, are there condemned. Which seeing all men
agree, in duties of the first table, the same reason and proportion earieth it
to those of the second also. And that may further appear by our Savior
Christ's interpretation of the seventh commandment, extending it to all kind
of lust, Mat. 5. 28. So does the Apostle James the sixth commandment, setting
it forth by the three degrees thereof lusting, eagerly affecting, (when the
heart is wholly possessed with it) and lastly fighting and warring James 4. 2.
As for the saying of Paul, Romans 7. 7. I had not known lust, except the Law had
said, Thou shall not lust, I take it (under reformation of better judgment) to
be meant not of any one Commandment in particular, but of the whole purity
(that way) which the Law of God thoroughout requires. And that as well in the
duties to God, as to our brethren. Which the Apostle soundly gathers to be
commanded in the Law, because the Law is spiritual. And this he says (verse
9) came and was, as it were, a new commandment unto him, when he understood
the whole Law to be spiritual and to reach to the lust and desire of the
heart. which in the darkness of his pharisaisme he had not learned. Because
this exposition of the tenth Commandment, does vary from that which is
generally received, I have opened my reasons the more at large. Let the learned
Judge.


Contentednes is to Heb. 13. 5. 1. Tim. 6. 6. 8. Phil. 4. 11, 12.

Chap. 13. Of our own Righteousness, whereof the state of Angels and Men,
before and by their fall.
Hitherto of the parts of righteousness: The several kinds follow.

Righteousness is Phil. 3. 9. Romans 9. 30. 31, 32. and 10. 3, 4, 5, 6. Gal. 3.
12. The first, requiring righteousness from our selves, or by our own works,
and propounding life everlasting if we do it, is called the Law, or the
covenant of works, Romans 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. The other, sending us to Christ,
and propounding life everlasting through him, if we believe in him, is called
the covenant of grace, Romans 10. 4. Gal. 3. 13, 14. Which is two fould,
according to the diverse dispensation of the times before and since his
coming. The covenant of grace before his coming in the flesh (being thorough
Christ to come) was termed the old Testament, Heb. 8. 13. and the publishing
thereof, the promise, Acts 13. 32. Gal. 3. 17. 18. The same covenant since his
coming (being thorough Christ already come) is termed the new Testament,
Ierem. 31. 31, 32, 33, 34. and the publishing thereof, the Gospel, Acts 13.
32. Marc. 1. 1.

The Law being impossible for us in this our corrupt estate, to perform,
Romans 8 3. serves not at all to justify, Gal. 3. 10, 11, 21, 22. But 1. to
show and discover sin, Romans 3. 20. and 7. 7. 2. Through the corruption of
our nature to increase sin, Romans 7. 8, 9, 10, 11. 3. To pronounce against us
judgment and condemnation due unto sin, Romans 3 19. and thereby to drive us
unto Christ, Romans 10. 4. Gal. 3. 22. 23, 24.

To the regenerate it further serves. 1. As a light to direct us, Psalm. 119
105. 2. As a prick to incite us, because of Gods commandment. 3. To frame us to
humility, seeing thereby how far we are from fulfilling it.

The difference between the Law and the Gospel stands in these three
things. 1. The Law offers salvation under condition of perfect obedience,
that is to say, if we do it: the Gospel under condition of faith, that is to
say, if we believe, Romans 10. 5, 6. 2. The Law commands only, but gives no
power to perform it, and therefore is called the dead letter, written with ink
and in tables of stone to be read and seen, but having no life in it to change
the heart, which remains as stony as before. The Gospel not only
commands, but gives faith and newness of life: And is therefore said to be
written in our hearts and called the Spirit, because it gives the Spirit of
Christ and righteousness through him, 2. Cor. 3. 3, 6, 9. 3. The Law
pronounces nothing but judgment and condemnation against us, commanding
things altogether impossible through our corruption, and therefore terrefieth
and amazeth the conscience, in which respect it is called the ministry of
death and of condemnation, 2. Cor. 3, 7, 9. The Gospel brings glad tydinges
of peace and reconciliation, and therefore quieteth and appeaseth the
conscience, Romans 5. 1. for both parts of this latter difference, see Romans 10.

parts of his Priesthood are, Oblation and Intercession.

Oblation Heb. 8. 2, 3. and 10. 5, 10, 20.
is the of offering of him self up to God his Father for it. And has two
parts, Sanctification and Satisfaction.

Sanctification John 17. 19. Romans 1. 4. Ioh. 6. 27, 48, 50, 5^ 57, 58, 63.

Favors only, are those that change not man's corrupt nature. And may all be

Calling is the Genesis 9. 36.

Chap. 7. Of Knowledge.
Gifts are such Ephesians. 4, 7, 8
favors bestowed in his Chuch: and are Knowledge, or gifts for the Churches

Knowledge, is the understanding of the will of his Father. Which, beside the

Chapter 8. Of Faculties.
Gifts for the 1 Cor. 12. 7.
Churches common good, are a 1 Cor. 12. 4.
Faculty and Ministry. Both which have some things extraordinary,
specially serving the dispensation of the Exodus 4. 2. etc. Numb. 12. 6. Deuteronomy.

Faculty is a gift fit for some public function in the Church. As 1 Cor. 12.
8, 28. Romans 12. 8.
Discretion to govern: Knowledge, to teach the doctrine of Christ out of the
Scripture, by laying forth the truth soundly, and co^futing of contrary
errors. Wisdom, to apply it also to all good uses, of comforting, denouncing,
stirring up, reproving, in one word termed exhorting: singlenes of heart, to
relieve the poor: Cheerfulness, in tending the impotent and sick.

The 1 Cor. 12 9, 1^.
extraordinary faculties are those, of healing, workinge of powers,
foretelling things to come, discerning of spirits, sorts of tongues,
interpretation of tongues.

Chap 9. Of Ministeries.
Ministry is a public function in the Church. Ministers Romans 12. 6, 7, 8*
are Gouerners or (...).

Gouerners are 1 Cor. 14. 34. 1 Timothy 2. 12.

doubt arise which is to weighty for one Church to decide, it must be Zach. 7.

general meeting of the gouerners of many Churches.

Government is in order and censure. Order is of the outward comelines of the
Church: as 2 Chro. 30. 2, 3, 4, 5.
of time, and place of meeting, Acts, 16. 4
rites, ceremonies, and such like. But especially this order is to be
considered in two principal things concerning public functions, that is, a
Heb. 5. 4. 5
calling and displacing.

Calling is the appointing of a Ezee. 44. 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16
fit person to some function. And stands upon two parts, Election and
Ordination.

Election is the Number 8. 16. 19 Acts. 14. 23.
chosing of him to the charge.

Ordination is the Numb. 8. 10, 14 Acts 13. 2, 3
separating of him thereunto, by the laying on of hands. Displacing is the
Ezra. 2. 62 1 Timothy 3. 10
putting out of an unfit person.

So much touching order: Censure is a correction of 1 Timothy 5. 20 Math. 18. 17
known offenders: where no 1 Timothy 5. 19
accusation against a Gouerner is to be admitted under two witnesses. A
censure is admonition, or expulsion.

Admonition is a Prou. 5. 12, 14 1 Timothy 5. 20 Math. 18. 17
rebuke by word.

Expulsion is a throwing of heinous offenders out of the Church. And is
excommunication or a Curse.

Excommunication is an Gen 17. 14 Exodus 12. 19 Math. 18. 17 1 Cor 5. 2, 7, 1^
expulsion till 1 Cor. 5. 5 1 Timothy 1. 20
repentance.

A Auathoma maran atha.
Curse is an expulsion for Jude verse. 14 1 Cor. 16. 22 1 John. 5. 16
ever.

These are the parts of government: there remain the sundry kinds of those
that govern.

Gouerners 1 Timothy 5. 17
are Elders or Whom we now commonly call Ministers.
Bishops. An Elder is he which is to govern only.

A Bishopp is he which is to preach also. In whose election it is to be
observed, that he 1 Timothy 3. 2, 6.
have been some good while a professor of Christ. Preaching is Romans 10. 15.
the public instructing of the Church, Acts 10. 43. Rom 10. 8. 2 Cor. 3. 6.
concerning Christ. 1 Samuel 12. 25. Acts 6. 4. Mat. 28. 19.
Whereunto are annexed public prayer and administration of the Sacraments.

Public prayer is the Nehem. 8. 6. 1 Cor. 14. 14, 15, 16, 17.
offering of the Churches supplications to God. Sacraments are outward Romans 4.

signs for confirmation publikly administered. Of which nature were all the

Here is the double difference bewene the old Testamente (thorough Christ to
come) and the new (thorough Christ already come.) i The old was restrained to
the nation of the Jews, the new enlarged to all nations both Jews and
Gentiles.

under the new plainly without any shadows, and therefore more plenty of grace
now the^ was unto the Fathers, Joel 2. 18. Ac. 2. 17


Jews, then his peculiar people, whereby the dispensation, of those times was
John 1. 16, 17
more obscure, and less accompanied with knowledge and other graces.

A Bishopp is a Romans 12. 7.
Teacher or Pastor. Teacher which is to teach only.

Pastor which is also exhort.

These the Gouerners: (...) are those who are to attend the poor: as Romans 12.
8.
Deacons and Deaconesses.

Deacons are the Acts 6. 1, 2, 3. 1 Cor, 16. 1.
distributers of the Church alms.

1 Timothy 5. 9, 10, 16. Romans 16. 1.
Deaconesses are aged poor widows, which are to tend the impotent and sick.

The extraordinary ministers were, in all times, Acts 3. 21. and 11, 27, 28.
Prophets, endued with extraordinary faculties, especially of foretelling
things to come; In the times before Christ's coming, either high Priests, the
standing Heb. 9. 11 Zach. 3. 1

Chapt. 12. Of the two degrees oF a Regenerate estate.
Of a regenerate estate (and therefore also of the fruits coming from it) there
be Ephe. 4. 13 1 Cor. 13. 10, 11, 12.
two degrees, as it were two ages, infancy and man's estate. Infancy is a
Phil. 3. 11, 12
weak inception all our life: sealed up in our own inward Rom, 8. 16, 17.
assurance of the Spirit, not in the 1 John. 3. 2 Collos. 3. 3 2 Cor. 5. 7
worlds discerning of it: and Ephesians. 4. 13, 15, 16.
grows according as our faith does grow. This age, or the tenderness of it,
has the help of two 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4 1 Cor. 12. 13
Sacraments to confirm it by, Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

Baptism is a washing with water, to assure our Gal. 3. 27, 28
incorporating into Christ, figured in Colos. 2. 11, 12
circumcision before his coming.

The Supper is a receiving of Bread and Wine, to assure our 1 Cor. 10. 1^

Dead unto sin, is Romans 6. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14.
when sin bears no more the rule in us: wrought Romans 6. 3, 6 Heb. 9. 14

Living unto righteousness is Romans 6. 18.
when righteousness bears the rule in us, wrought Romans 6. 4, 5. 1 Pet. 1. 3.
by the power of his resurrection.

FINIS.
A short explication of the Lords Prayer, which (together with the ten
Commaundmentes) conteyneth a brief of all the main heads of the whole
substance of Divinity, in a most exact method, as the table following will
show.
THE LORDS Prayer, delivered by our Savior Christ as a pattern to frame all
our Prayers by, conteyneth a most absolute and perfect direction, as well for
the circumstances to be observed in praying, as for the matter it self of our
prayer.

The circumstances are these: 1 To God only through Christ. For neither Math.
23. ^0
have we any other Father in Heaven but him alone, neither is he our Father
but in Christ.

2 Praeparation: taught by using of a praeface.

3 Faith, particularly applying to our selves the love of GOD in Christ. Our
Father.

4 Confidence, as a child goes bouldly to his Father.

5 Reverence of his Majesty, Who is in Heaven.

6 Zeal and earnestnes in prayer; that all our affections be taken up, and
wholly bent upon it. Which the shortness of the prayer teaches, and the
concluding of it with this word, Amen.

7. A greater feruency of Spirit in praying for the things that concern Gods
glory, then for those that concern our own good, yea though it be the
salvation of our souls. As appears by the order of the petitions, and in
that those first three are without any coupling bond at all, which the latter
three have. Again of the things which concern our own good, greater zeal
and feruency to be showed for heavenly things which the three latter Petitions
do ask by name, then for earthly things that are sought but as additaments
and appendancies to the other.

8 A fellow-feeling and love one unto an other, Our Father, our bread, our
trespasses, lead us not deliver us, etc.

9 An assurance of obteyning the things we pray for. Earthly things with
condition, so far as God has appointed them for our good. All other
absolutely without condition. Which assurance is noted in the word, Amen
signifying that not only so we desire it may be, but that so undoubtedly it is
and shall be. Whereunto we are induced, both by consideration of the love of God,
our Father, and of his power, which is in Heaven.

Lastly, continuance in prayer, give us this day, Every day renewing our
supplications.

So much of the circumstances. The matter is partly in petition, and partly in
thanksgiving, The petitions are six in number. All in that course and order as
the doctrine before was handled. Whereof the first three are of those things
that belong to Gods glory without any respect of our own good, As the
particle, thy, in every one does show. And this one thing, wherein the soundest
Divines agree, being well observed, brings a great light for the
distinguishing of all the six Petitions according to their proper bounds and
limits, in such sort as hereafter follows.

The first Petition, I. PETITI. GOD. his Essence. Persons. Perfection.
Hallowed be thy Name. O thou the blessed and great Iehoua, Father, Son, and
holy Spirit, three persons and one only: true and everliving God, whose Esaias.
9. ^.
Name is Wonderful, and who alone art glorious and excellent; thy mercy great
unto the heavens: thy truth unto the clouds: thy righteousness as the mighty
hills: thy judgments like the bottomless deep: exalt thy self. o God, above
the heavens, thy glory over all the earth. And make it known unto thy
Creatures, that thou the Creator (blessed for ever, Amen) art a nature
spiritual and divine, of thy self, and in thy self, and by thy self
subsisting. Eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, infinite in Power,
Wisdom, Holiness, Truth, The causes of his own perfection, and of all good
and perfect things ^n other.
Mercy, Justice, and whatsoever good is: yea goodness and perfection it self. So
that boeth whatsoeur thou do, is absolutely good and holy, and all good and
perfect guiftes are thine, there being no jot nor resemblance of good in any
creature but that only which they have from thee, who art the Father of lights.

And this respects the first part of Theology, which is of the nature,
persons, and properties of the Godhead.

The second Petition, 2. PETIT. The KINGDOM of God in his
Thy Kingdom come. Advance the throne and scepter of thy kingdom in the
government of the world according to all thy counsels and purposes decreed from
eternity. Eternal Decrees.
Whether of saving the elect or destroying of the reprobate, Election.
or of the business and affairs perteining to this life, Reprobation. Creation.
Government.
and thy general providence over all things; that thy hands have fashioned
and made. Together with the means which thou have sanctified thereunto. The
absolute will of God, disposing the means according to his own good pleasure.
That the reprobate may either not hear at all, or hearing not believe, nor
be converted, but hardened in their sins; and thy Gospel with the Ministry
and Preaching thereof, the Sacraments, Censures and discipline of the Church,
and all other good things thou have ordained, may (through their own fault)
turn unto their ruin, and be a savor of death unto death unto them, as
co^trariewise to the elect a savor of life unto life. The generality of his
decrees and works, stretching unto all creatures and actions.
And that thou would so dispose of things by thy hidden and secret
providence, that all persons and creatures (although they, many of them,
sinnefully and wretchedlie, moved with other causes and ends then in obedience
unto thee, yet in regard of thy work most holily and justly) may concur to
do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel has foredetermined to be done:
Neither let any power or policy of Satan or man, The inniolable Necessity of
the execution of his consells.
or any other creature, hinder the execution of thy most glorious and
magnificent, most wise and just decrees. But let them all be as the mountains
of brass, that cannot be removed but stand fast for ever.

And this respects the second branch of Theology, touching the kingdom of
God, and the dispensation of his counsels.

The third petition, 3. PETIT. The HONOR due to God. Performed by Angels.
Saints in Heaven. The Church upon earth.
Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Have thou always in the
world, even here among men, as thou have among thy holy Angels and Spirits of
the righteous that are deceased: a Church and chosen company, which may Zach.
6. 8.
refresh and delight thy Spirit, by yielding with free and ready hearts, all
cheerful obedience to thy known and revealed will. Whilst they be seen to
prefer the love they bear to thee, before the love of themselves, their own
pleasure, profit, or lives, or whatsoever else that is most dear unto them.

And this (which is the third branch of Theology) rises by a necessary
consequence from the former two. For he that is in himself and in his works so
glorious, is worthy and alone worthy to be honored and served of us.

The three latter Petitions are of those things that concern our own and our
neighbors good, whereof the first (being the fourth nature and essence.
Conceived and born of a virgin by the wonderful work of thy holy Spirit:
Sanctification of his humane nature.
Sanctified from the womb, to be the mighty and powerful instrument in and
by whose flesh or humane nature, the Godhead, unto the which he is personally
united, quickens all those that by faith are ingraffed in him; Replenished
with all righteousness and fulness of the Spirit above measure: Righteousness.
And therefore in him self most happy and blessed, Blessedness.
but for us and our sakes accursed, Sufferings.
in that he bare thy whole wrath due to our finnes, and became subject to
death, the most of God, fall afterward to his adioyntes of kingdom and
honor: so these begin with Christ and regeneration through him, the fruits
whereof are Justification and Sanctification which follow in their place. As
the Apostle, agreeably hereunto reduces all the benefits we have by Christ to
those three heads, and that in the same order. 1 John 5. 8. There be three
which hear record in earth. The Spirit, wherein we are regenerate: water,
whereby we are washed and cleaned from our sin; And Blood, purging and
abolishing both the root and the fruits of it. Which is attributed to the
blood of Christ, Heb. 9. 14. 1 John. 1. 7, 9. And that it is so to be taken in
this place, not for expiation, I gather by that the Apostle says verse. 6 This
is he that came by water and blood, not by water only, but water and blood.
That is to say, not our Iustifier only which all men do willingly embrace:
but to sanctify us also, which men will not so easily be brought to yield
unto.

4. Seeing it is plain that in asking pardon of our sins and righteousness in
Christ (which we do in the fifth petition) Consequently we ask all the
belssednes belonging to it. One part whereof is this, to have all outward
things as additaments and appendancies cast unto us, so far as God has
appointed the^ for our good, as our Savior Christ's both speech and promise
is, Mat. 6. 33. and further then that we have no warrant to desire them; it
seems not so likely that either our Savior Christ would rent these things
asunder and transplant one from another, or in so short a sum admit of
repetition, which must needs follow if being there included we ask them here
by name. And this also may serve to prove that no defect or may me ca^ justly
be imputed to this absolute form of prayer, though outward things come not
within compass of the fourth petition.

5. The doubling of the article (...) shows it to be meant of no common
bread, but a bread of some rare and singular quality. The like doubling of the
article for emphasis sake you may see Math. 3. 17. Luke. 15. 22, 23. and in
diverse other places. Lastly the word (...) which makes all the doubt, being
never read but in this prayer only, and therefore of an uncertain
signification, I derive form (...) with the best Interpreters, as I make no
doubt it must of necessity be: But not in that sense which I see them to do.
Who expound it competent or sufficient for our nature, that is for our
sustenance and nourishment. Of which signification of the word (...) you shall
hardly find nay example, as H. Stephen in his greek Thesaurus notes. But in
that sense which the Scripture uses it Luc. 15. 12, 13. (and never otherwise)
as it signifies wealth and substance, from whence I take to be derived two
words of near affinity (...) here, and (...) Tit. 2. 14. One noting that
which as the remayn and overplus of our substance we lay up in store and keep
for a Jewel, the other that which excels all wealth and substance. Which
(among many other) is one signification of the praeposition (...) Romans 9. 5.
Ephe. 4. 6. And so does (...) aptly answer to the Haebrue Hal col hon Psalm.
119. 14. I rejoice in the way of thy testimonies, as above all substance. And
it seems unto me that our Savior Christ does herein allude to that saying
of Solomon Cantie. 8. 11. If a man would give all the substance of his house
for this love (of Jesus Christ, to whom I am even now ascending out of the
wilderness of this world to join and unite my self by faith) he should utterly
be despised. Yet the other interpretation which the most learned and best
divines of our time do follow, carries a sound and a Godly sense, against
