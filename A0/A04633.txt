THE PROLOGVE TO THE KINGS MAJESTY.
YOur Majesty is welcome to a Fair;
Such place, such men, such language and such ware,
You must expect: with these, the zealous noise
Of your lands Faction, scandalized at toys,
As Babies, Hobby-horses, Puppet-playes,
And such like rage, whereof the petulant ways
Your self have known, and have bin vexed with long.
These for your sport, without particular wrong,
Or just complaint of any priuat^ man,
(Who of himself, or shall think well or can)
The Maker does present: and hopes, to night
To give you for a Fayring, true delight.

THE INDVCTION. ON THE STAGE.
STAGE-KEEPER. GEntlemen, have a little patience, they are even upon coming,
instantly* He that should begin the Play, Master Littlewit, the Proctor, has
a stitch new fallen in his black silk stocking; 'twill be drawn up ere you can
tell twenty. He plays one of the Arches, that dwells about the Hospital, and
he has a very pretty part. But for the whole Play, will you ha'the truth on it?
(I am looking, lest the Poet hear me, or his man, Master Broom, behind the
Arras) it is like to be a very conceited scuruy one, in plain English. When It
comes to the Fair, once: you were even as good go to Virginia, for any thing
there is of Smith-field. He has not hit the humors, he does not know 'hem; he
has not conuers'd with the Bartholmew-birds, as they say; he has never a
Sword, and Buckler man in his Fair, nor a little Dauy, to take toll of the
Bawds there, as in my time, nor a Kind-heart, if any bodies teeth should chance
to ache in his Play. Nor a Iugler with a wel-educated Ape to come over the
chain, for the King of England, and back again for the Prince, and sit still
on his arse for the Pope, and the King of Spain! None o'these fine sights! Nor
has he the Canuas-cut'ithe night, for a Hobby-horseman to creep into his
she-neighbour, and take his leap, there! Nothing! No, and some writer (that I
know) had had but the penning of this matter, he would have made you such a
Iig-ajogge in the boothes, you should have thought an earthquake had been in the
Fair! But these Master- Poets, they will have their own absurd courses; they
will be informed of nothing! He has ( sirreuerence) kicked me three, or four
times about the Tyring-house, I thank him, for but offering to putt in, with
my experience. I Will be judged by you, Gentlemen, now, but for one conceit of
mine! would not a fine Pumpe upon the Stage have done well, for a property now?
and a Punque set under upon her head, with her Stern upward, and have been
fous'd by my wity young masters of the Innes of Court? what think you of this
for a show, now? he will not hear of this! I am an Ass! I! and yet I kept the
Stage in Master Tarletons time, I thank my stars. Ho! and that man had lived
to have played in Bartholmew Fair, you should have seen him have come in, and
have been coozened in the Cloath-quarter, so finely! And Adams, the Rogue, ha
leaped and caper'd upon him, and have dealt his vermin about, as though they
had cost him nothing. And then a substantial watch to have stolen in upon 'hem,
and taken 'hem away, with mistaking words, as the fashion is, in the
Stage-practice.


Booke-holder: Scriuener. To him. Book. How now? what rare discourse are you
fallen upon? ha? have you found any familiars here, that you are so free? what is
the business?


Sta. Nothing, but the understanding Gentlemen o^ the ground here, asked my
judgment.


Book. Your judgment, Rascal? for what? sweeping the Stage? or gathering up
the broken Apples for the bears within? Away Rogue, it is come to a fine degree
in these spectacles when such a youth as you pretend to a judgment. And yet
he may, in the most of this matter in faith: For the Author has writ it just to
his Meridian, and the Scale of the grounded Judgments here, his Play-fellowes
in wit. Gentlemen; not for want of a Prologue, but by way of a new one, I am
sent out to you here, with a Scriuener, and certain Articles drawn out in
have between our Author, and you; which if you please to hear, and as they
appear reasonable, to approve of; the Play will follow presently. Read,
Scribe, gi'me the Counterpaine.


Scr. ARTICLES of Agreement, indented, between the Spectators or Hearers, at
the Hope on the Bankeside, in the County of Surrey on the one party; And the
Author of Bartholmew Fair in the said place, and County on the other party:
the one and thirtieth day of October. 1614. and in the twelfth year of the
Reign of our Soueragine Lord, JAMES by the grace of God King of England,
France, and Ireland, Defender of the faith. And of Scotland the seven and
fortieth.

INPRIMIS, It is couenanted and agreed, by and between the parties abouesaid,
and the said Spectators, and Hearers, as well the curious and envious, as the
favoring and judicious, as also the grounded Judgments and understandings,
do for themselves severally Covenant, and agree to remain in the places,
their money or friends have put them in, with patience, for the space of two
hours and an half, and somewhat more. In which time the Author promises to
present them by us, with a new sufficient Play called BARTHOLMEW FAIR, merry,
and as full of noise, as sport: made to delight all, and to offend none.
Provided they have either, the wit or the honesty to think well of themselves.

It is further agreed that every person here, have his or their free will of
censure, to like or dislike at their own charge, the Author having now
departed with his right: It shall be lawful for any man to judge his six
pen'orth his twelve pen'orth, so to his eighteen pence, 2. shillings, half a
crown, to the value of his place: Provided always his place get not above his
wit. And if he pay for half a dozen, he may censure for all them too, so that
he will undertake that they shall be silent. He shall put in for Censures
here, as they do for lots at the lottery: mary if he drop but six pence at
the door, and will censure a crowns worth, it is thought there is no
conscience, or justice in that.

It is also agreed, that every man here, exercise his own Judgment, and not
censure by Contagion, or upon trust, from another voice, or face, that sits by
him, be he never so first, in the Commission of Wit: As also, that he be fixed
and settled in his censure, that what he approues, or not approues to day, he
will do the same to morrow, and if to morrow, the next day, and so the next
week (if need be:) and not to be brought about by any that sits on the Bench
with him, though they indite, and arraigne Plays daily. He that will swear,
Ieronimo, or Andronicus are the best plays, yet, shall pass vnexcepted at,
here, as a man whose Judgment shows it is constant, and has stood still,
these five and twenty, or thirty years. Though it be an Ignorance, it is a
virtuous and stayed ignorance; and next to truth, a confirmed error does well;
such a one the Author knows where to find him.

It is further couenanted, concluded and agreed, that how great soever the
expectation be, no person here, is to expect more then he knows, or better
ware then a Fair will afford: neither to look back to the sword and
buckler-age of Smithfield, but content himself with the present. In stead of a
little Dauy; to take toll of the Bawds, the Author does promise a strutting
Horse-courser, with a leere-Drunkard, two or three to attend him, in as good
Equipage as you would wish. And then for Kinde-heart, the Tooth-drawer, a fine
oily Pig-woman with her Tapster, to bid you welcome, and a consort of Roarers
for music. A wise Justice of Peace meditant, in stead of a Iugler, with an
Ape. A civil Cutpurse searchant. A sweet Singer of new Ballads allur^nt: and
as fresh an Hypocrite, as ever was broached rampant. If there be never a
Seruant-monster in the Fair; who can help it? he says; nor a nest of
Antiques? He is loath to make Nature afraid in his Plays, like those that
beget Tales, Tempests, and such like Drolleries, to mix his head with other
men's heels; let the concupisence of Iigges and Dances, reign as strong as it
will amongst you: yet if the Puppets will please any body, they shall be
entreated to come in.

In consideration of which, it is finally agreed, by the foresaid hearers, and
spectators, that they neither in themselves conceal, nor suffer by them to be
concealed any State-decipherer, or politic Picklocke of the Scene, so
solemnly ridiculous, as to search out, who was meant by the Ginger-bread-woman,
who by the Hobby-horse-man, who by the Costard-monger, nay, who by their Wares.
Or that will pretend to affirm (on his own inspired ignorance) what Mirror of
Magistrates is meant by the Justice, what great Lady by the Pigge-woman, what
concealed Statesman, by the Seller of Mouse-trappes, and so of the rest. But
that such person, or persons so found, be left discovered to the mercy of the
Author, as a forfeiture to the Stage, and your laughter, aforesaid. As also,
such as shall so desperately, or ambitiously, play the fool by his place
aforesaid, to challenge the Author of scurrilitie, because the language some
where savors of Smithfield, the Booth, and the Pig-broath, or of
profaneness, because a Madman cries, God quit you, or bless you. In
witness whereof, as you have preposterously put to your Seals already (which
is your money) you will now add the other part of suffrage, your hands, The
Play shall presently begin. And though the Fair be not kept in the same
Region, that some here, perhaps, would have it, yet think* that therein the
Author has observed a special Decorum, the place being as durty as
Smithfield, and as stinking every whit.

Howsoever, he prays you to believe, his Ware is still the same, else you
will make him justly suspect that he that is so loath to look on a Baby, or an
Hobbyhorse, here, would be glad to take up a Commodity of them, at any
laughter, or loss, in another place.


BARTHOLMEVV FAIR.
ACT. I. SCENE. I.
LITTLE-VVIT. To him VVIN. A Pretty conceit, and worth the finding! I have such
luck to spinne out these fine things still, and like a Silke-worme, out of my
self. Here Is Master Bartholomew Cokes, of Harrow o'th hill, in the County of
Middlesex, Esquire, takes forth his License, to marry Mistress Grace Wel-borne
of the said place and County: and when does he take it forth? to day! the
four and twentieth of August! Bartholmew day! Bartholmew upon Bartholmew!
there is the device! who would have marked such a leap-frogge chance now? A very
less then Ames-ace, on two Dice! well, go thy ways John Little-wit, Proctor
John Little-wit: One of the pretty wits of Paul's, the Little wit of London (so
thou art called) and some thing beside. When a quirk, or a quiblin does escape
thee, and thou do not watch, and apprehend it, and bring it before the
Constable of conceit: (there now, I speak quib too) let'hem carry thee out of
the Archdeacons Court, into his Kitchen, and make a Jack of thee, in stead of a
John. (There I am again la!) Win, Good morrow, Win. I marry Win! Now you look
finely indeed, Win! this Cap does convince! youl'd not ha^ worn it, VVin, nor
have had it velvet, but a rough country Beauer, with a copper-band, like the
Conney-skinne woman of Budge-row? Sweet VVin, let me kiss it! And. her fine
high shoes, like the Spanish Lady! Good VVin, go a little I would feign see
thee pace, pretty VVin! By this fine Cap, I could never leave kissing on it.


WIN. Come, indeed la, you are such a fool, still!


LITT. No, but half a one, Win, you are the the other half: man and wife make
one fool, Win. (Good!) Is there the Proctor, or Doctor indeed, in the Diocese,
that ever had the fortune to win him such a Win! (There I am again!) I do
feel conceits coming upon me, more then I am able to turn tongue too. A
pox o these pretenders, to wit! your Three Cranes, Miter, and Mermaid men! Not
a corn of true salt, nor a grain of right mustard amongst them all. They may
stand for places or so, again the next Wit fall, and pay two pence in a quart
more for their Canary, then other men. But gi' me the man, can start up a
Justice of Wit out of six-shillings bear, and give the law to all the Poets,
and Poet-suckers in Town, because they are the Players Gossips? 'Slid, other
men have wives as fine as the Players, and as well dressed. Come hither, Win.


ACT. I. SCENE. IJ.
WIN-WIFE. LITTLEVVIT. WIN. WHy, how now Master Little-wit! measuring of lips?
or molding of kisses? which is it?


LITT. Troth I am a little taken with my Wins dressing here! Do not fine
Master Win-wife? How do you apprehend, Sir? She would not have worn this
habit. I challenge all Cheapside, to show such another: Morefields, Pimlic^
path, or the Exchange, in a summer evening, with a Lace to boot as this has.
Dear Win, let Master Win-wife kiss you. He comes a wooing to our mother Win,
and may be our father perhaps, Win. There Is no harm in him, Win.


WIN-W. None in the earth, Master Little-wit.


LITT. I envy no man, my delicates, Sir.


WIN-W. Alas, you have the garden where they grow still! A wife here with a
Strawbery-breath, Chery-lips, Apricot-cheekes, and a soft velvet head, like a
Melicotion.


LITT. Good in faith! now dullness upon me, that I had not that before him,
that I should not light on it, as well as he! Velvet head!


WIN-W. But my taste, Master Little-wit, tends to fruict of a later kind: the
sober Matron, your wives mother.


LITT. I! we know you are a Suitor, Sir. Win, and I both, wish you well: by
this License here, would you had her, that your two names were as fast in it,
as here are a couple. Win would feign have a fine young father in law, with a
fether: that her mother might hood it, and chain it, with Mistress Ouer-doo.
But, you do not take the right course, Master Win-wife.


WIN-W. No? Master Litle-wit, why?


LIT. You are not mad enough.


WIN-W. How? Is madness a right course?


LIT. I say nothing, but I wink upon Win. You have a friend, one (Master
Quarlous) comes here some times?


WIN-W. Why? he makes no love to her, does he?


LIT. Not a tokenworth that ever I saw, I assure you, But --


WIN-W. What?


LIT. He is the more Mad-cap of the two. You do not apprehend me.


WIN. You have a hot coal in your mouth, now, you cannot hold.


LIT. Let me out with it, dear Win.


WIN. I Will tell him my self.


LIT. Do, and take all the thanks, and much do good thy pretty heart, Win.


WIN. Sir, my mother has had her natiuity-water cast lately by the Cunning men
in Cow^lane, and they have told her her fortune, and do ensure her, she shall
never have happy hour; unless she marry within this sen'night, and when it
is, it must be a Madde-man, they say.


LIT. I, but it must be a Gentleman Madman.


WIN. Yes, so the the other man of More-fields says.


WIN-W. But does she believe 'hem?


LIT. Yes, and has been at Bedlem twice since, every day, to enquire if any
Gentleman be there, or to come there, mad!


WIN-W. Why, this is a confederacy, a mere piece of practice upon her, by
these Impostors?


LIT. I tell her so; or else say I, that they mean some young.
Madcap-Gentleman (for the devil can equivocate, as well as a Shopkeeper) and
therefore would I advise you, to be a little madder, then Master Quarlous,
hereafter.


WIN. Where is she? stirring yet?


LIT. Stirring! Yes, and studying an old Elder, come from Banbury, a Suitor
that puts in here at meale-tyde, to praise the painful brethren, or pray
that the sweet singers may be restored; Says a grace as long as his breath
lasts him! Some time the spirit is so strong with him, it gets quite out of
him, and then my mother, or Win, are feign to fetch it again with Malmesey, or
Aqua coelestis.


WIN. Yes indeed, we have such a tedious life with him for his diet, and his
clothes too, he breaks his buttons, and cracks seames at every saying he sobs
out.


IOH. He cannot abide my Vocation, he says.


WIN. No, he told my mother, a Proctor was a claw of the Beast, and that she
had little less then committed abomination in marrying me so as she has done.


IOH. Every line (he says) that a Proctor writes, when it comes to be read in
the Bishops Court, is a long black hair, kemb'd out of the tail of
Antichrist.


WIN-W. When came this Proselyte?


IOH. Some three days since.


ACT. I. SCENE. IIJ.
QVARLOVS, JOHN, WIN, WIN-VVIFE. O Sir, have you taken soil, here? it is well, a
man may reach you, after 3. hours running, yet! what an unmerciful companion
art thou, to quit thy lodging, at such ungentle manly hours? None but a
scatterd couey of Fidiers, or one of these Rag-rakers in dung-hills, or some
Marrow-bone man at most, would have been up, when thou were gone abroad, by
all description. I pray thee what aylest thou, thou can not sleep? have thou
Thorns i'thy eyelids, or Thistles i'thy bed.


WIN-W. I cannot tell: It seems you had neither in your feet; that took this
pain to find me.


QVAR. No, and I had, all the Lime-hounds of the City should have drawn after
you, by the sent rather, Mr John Little-wit! God save you, Sir. 'Twas a hot
night with some of us, last night, John: shall we pluck a hair of the same
Wolf, to day, Proctor John?


IOH. Do you remember Master Quarlous, what we discourst on, last night?


QVAR. Not I, John: nothing that I either discourse or do, at those times I
forfeit all to forgetfulness.


IOH. No? not concerning Win, look you: there she is, and dressed as I told you
she should be: hark you Sir, had you forgot?


QVAR. By this head, I Will beware how I keep you company, John, when I drunk,
and you have this dangerous memory! that is certain.


IOH. Why Sir?


QVAR. Why? we were all a little stained last night, sprinkled with a cup or
two, and I agreed with Proctor John here, to come and do somewhat with Win (I
know not what 'twas) to day; and he puts me in mind on it, now; he says he
was coming to fetch me: before Truth, if you have that fearful quality,
John, to remember, when you are sober, John, what you promise drunk, John; I
shall take heed of you, John. For this once, I am content to wink at you,
where is your wife? come hither Win. (He kisseth her.


WIN. Why, John! do you see this, John? look you! help me, John.


IOH. O Win, fie, what do you mean, Win! Be womanly, Win; make an outcry to
your mother, Win? Master Quarlous is an honest Gentleman, and our worshipful
good friend, Win: and he is Master Winwifes friends, too: And Master Win-wife
comes a Suitor to your mother Win; as I told you before, Win, and may perhaps,
be our Father, Win, they will do you no harm, Win, they are both our worshipful
good friends. Master Quarlous! you must know Mr. Quarlous, Win; you must not
quarrel with Master Quarlous, VVin.


QVAR. No, we will kiss again and fall in.


IOH. Yes, do good Win.


WIN. In Faith you are a fool, John.


IOH. A Foole-Iohn she calls me, do you mark that, Gentlemen? pretty
littlewit of velvet! a fool- John!


QVAR. She may call you an Apple- John, if you use this.


WIN-W. Pray thee forbear, for my respect somewhat.


QVAR. Hoy-day! how respective you are become of the sudden! I fear this family
will turn you reformed too, pray you come about again. Because she is in
possibility to be your daughter in law, and may ask you blessing hereafter,
when she courts it to Totnam to eat cream. Well, I will forbear, Sir, but
in faith, would thou would leave thy exercise of widdow-hunting once! this
drawing after an old reverend Smock by the splay-foote: There cannot be an
ancient Tripe or Trillibub in the Town, but thou art straight nosing it, and
it is a fine occupation thou wilt confine thy self to, when thou have got one;
scrubbing a piece of Buffe, as if thou had the perpetuity of Pannyer-alley to
stink in; or perhaps, worse, currying a carcass, that thou have bound thy
self to alive. I Will besworne, some of them, (that thou art, or have been a
Suitor to) are so old, as no chaste or married pleasure can ever become 'hem:
the honest Instrument of procreation, has (forty years since) left to belong
to 'hem, thou must visit 'hem, as thou would do a Tomb, with a Torch, or
three hand-fulls of Lincke, flaming hot, and so thou may hap to make 'hem
feel thee, and after, come to inherit according to thy inches. A sweet course
for a man to waste the brand of life for, to be still ^aking himself a fortune
in an old woman's embers; we shall have thee after thou have been but a month
married to one of 'hem, look like the quartane ague, and the black Iaundise
met in a face, and walk as if thou had borrowed legs of a Spinner, and
voice of a Cricket. I would endure to hear fifteen Sermons aweeke for her,
and such course, and loud one's, as some of'hem must be; I would even desire of
Fate, I might dwell in a drum, and take in my sustenance, with an old broken
Tobacco-pipe and a Straw. Do thou ever think to bring thine ears or
stomach, to the patience of a dry grace, as long as thy Tablecloth? and
droan'd out by thy son, here, (that might be thy father;) till all the meat
o'thy board has forgot, it was that day in the Kitchen? Or to brook the noise
made, in a question of Predestination, by the good laborers and painful
eaters, assembled together, put to 'hem by the Matron, your Spouse; who
moderates with a cup of wine, ever and anon, and a Sentence out of Knoxe
between? or the perpetual spitting, before, and after a sober drawn
exhortation of six hours, whose better part was the hum-hahum? Or to hear
prayers groaned out, over thy iron-chests, as if they were charms to break
'hem? And all this for the hope of two Apostle-spoones, to suffer! and a cup to
eat a cawdle in! For that will be thy legacy. She Will have conuey'd her state,
safe enough from thee, an' she be a right widow.


WIN. Alas, I am quite off that sent now.


QVAR. How so?


WINW. Put off by a Brother of Banbury, one, that, they say, is come here, and
gouernes all, already.


QVAR. What do you call him? I knew diverse of those Banburians when I was in
Oxford.


WIN-W. Master Little-wit can tell us.


IOH. Sir! good VVin, go in, and if Master Bartholmew Cokes- his man come for
the License: (the little old fellow) let him speak with me; what say you,
Gentlemen?


WIN-W. What call you the Reverend Elder? you told me of? your Banbury-man.


IOH. Rabbi Busy, Sir, he is more then an Elder, he is a Prophet, Sir.


QVAR. O, I know him! a Baker, is he not?


IOH. He was a Baker, Sir, but he does dream now, and see visions, he has
given over his Trade.


QVAR. I remember that too: out of a scruple he took, that (in spic'd
conscience) those Cakes he made, were served to Bridales, May-poles,
Morrisses, and such profane feasts and meetings; his Christen-name is
Zeale-of-the-land.


IOH. Yes, Sir, Zeale-of-the-land Busye.


WIN-W. How, what a name's there!


IOH. O, they have all such names, Sir; he was Witness, for Win, here, (they
will not be called Godfathers) and named her VVinne-the-fight, you thought her
name had been VVinnifred, did you not?


WIN-W. I did indeed.


IOH. He would have thought himself a stark Reprobate, if it had.


QVAR. I, for there was a Blew-starch-woman of the name, at the same time. A
notable hypocritical vermin it is; I know him. One that stands upon his face,
more then his faith, at all times; Ever in seditious motion, and reproving for
vainglory: of a most lunatique conscience, and spleen, and affects the
violence of Singularity in all he does: (He has undone a Grocer here, in
New-gate-market, that broke with him, trusted him with Currants, as errant a
Zeal as he, that is by the way: by his profession, he will ever be in the state
of Innocence, though; and childhood; derides all Antiquity; defies any other
Learning, then Inspiration; and what discretion soever, years should afford
him, it is all prevented in his Original ignorance; have not to do with him:
for he is a fellow of a most arrogant, and invincible dullness, I assure you;
who is this?


ACT. I. SCEENE. IIIJ.
WASPE. JOHN. WIN-WIFE. QVARLOVS. BY your leave, Gentlemen, with all my heart
to you: and god you good morrow; Mr Little-wit, my business is to you. Is this
License ready?


IOH. Here, I have it for you, in my hand, Master Humphrey.


WAS. That Is well, nay, never open, or read it to me, it is labor in vain, you
know. I am no Clearke, I scorn to be saved by my book, in faith I Will hang
first; fold it up o'your word and gi' it me; what must you have for it?


IOH. We'll talk of that anon, Master Humphrey.


WAS. Now, or not at all, good Mr Proctor, I am for no anon's, I assure you.


IOH. Sweet VVin, bid Solomon send me the little black box within, in my
study.


WAS. I, quickly, good Mistress, I pray you: for I have both eggs of the Spit,
and iron in the fire, say, what you must have, good Mr Little-wit.


IOH. Why, you know the price, Mr Numps.


WAS. I know? I know nothing. I, what tell you me of knowing? (now I am in
have) Sir, I do not know, and I will not know, and I scorn to know, and yet,
(now I think on it) I will, and do know, as well as another; you must have a
Mark for your thing here, and eight pence for the box; I could have saved two
pence i'that, an' I had bought it my self, but here is fourteen shillings
for you. Good Lord! how long your little wife stays! pray God, Solomon, your
Clerk, be not looking in the wrong box, Mr Proctor.


IOH. Good in faith! no, I warrant you, Solomon is wiser then so, Sir.


WAS. Fie, fie, fie, by your leave Master Little-wit, this is scuruy, idle,
foolish and abominable, with all my heart; I do not like it.


WIN-W. Do you hear? Jack Little-wit, what business does thy pretty head
think, this fellow may have, that he keeps such a coil with?


QVAR. More then buying of ginger-bread in the Cloister, here, (for that we
allow him) or a guilt pouch in the Fair?


IOH. Master Quarlous, do not mistake him: he is his Masters both-hands, I
assure you.


QVAR. What? to pull on his boots, a mornings, or his stockings, does he?


IOH. Sir, if you have a mind to mock him, mock him softly, and look
to'ther way: for if he apprehend you flout him, once, he will fly at you
presently. A terrible testie old fellow, and his name is Waspe too.


QVAR. Pretty Insect! make much on him.


WAS. A plag^e of this box, and the pox too, and on him that made it, and her
that went for it, and all that should have sought it, sent it, or brought it! do
you see, Sir?


IOH. Nay, good Mr Waspe.


WAS. Good Master Hornet, turd in your teeth, hold you your tongue; do not I
know you? your father was a Pothecary, and sold glisters, more then he gave, I
wusse: and turd in your little wives teeth too (here she come^) 'twill make her
spit as fine as she is, for all her veluet-custerd on her head, Sir.


IOH. O! be civil Master Numpes.


WAS. Why, say I have a humor not to be civil; how then? who shall compel
me? you?


IOH. Here is the box, now.


WAS. Why a pox o'your box, once again: let your little wife stale in it, and
she will. Sir, I would have you to understand, and these Gentlemen too, if they
please --


WIN-W. With all our hearts. Sir.


WAS. That I have a charge. Gentlemen.


IOH. They do apprehend, Sir.


WAS. Pardon me, Sir, neither they nor you, can apprehend me, yet. (you are an
Ass) I have a young Master, he is now upon his making and marring; the whole
care of his well doing, is now mine. His foolish scholemasters have done
nothing, but run up and down the Country with him, to beg puddings, and
cake-bread, of his tennants, and almost spoiled him, he has learned nothing,
but to sing catches, and repeat rattle bladder rattle, and O, Madge. I dare not
let him walk alone, for fear of learning of vile tunes, which he will sing
at supper, and in the sermon-times! if he meet but a Carman in the street,
and I find him not talk to keep him off on him, he will whistle him, and
all his tunes over, at night in his sleep! he has a head full of Bees! I am
feign now (for this little time I am absent) to leave him in charge with a
Gentlewoman; It Is true, she is A Justice of Peace his wife, and a Gentlewoman
of the hood, and his natural sister* But what may happen, under a woman's
government, there is the doubt. Gentlemen, you do not know him: he is another
manner of piece then you think for! but nineteen year old, and yet he is
taller then either of you, by the head, God bless him.


QVAR. Well, me thinks, this is a fine fellow!


WIN-W. He has made his Master a finer by this description, I should think.


QVAR. 'Faith, much about one, it is cross and pile, whether for a new farthing.


WAS. I Will tell you Gentlemen --


IOH. Will It please you drink, Master VVaspe?


WAS. Why, I have not talked so long to be dry, Sir, you see no dust or cobwebs
come out of my mouth: do you? you would have me gone, would you?


IOH. No, but you were in have even now, Mr Numpes.


WAS. What an' I were? so I am still, and yet I will stay too; meddle you with
your match, your Win, there, she has as little wit, as her husband it seems: I
have others to talk to.


IOH. She Is my match indeed, and as little wit as I, Good!


WAS. We have bin but a day and a half in town, Gentlemen, it is true, and
yester day in the afternoon, we walked London, to show the City to the
Gentlewoman, he shall marry, Mistress Grace; but, before I will endure such
another half day, with him, I Will be drawn with a good Gib-cat, through the
great pond at home, as his uncle Hodge was! why, we could not meet that heathen
thing, all day, but ^ayd him: he would name you all the Signs over, as he
went, aloud: and where he spied a Parrat, or a Monkey, there he was pitched,
with all the littl-long-coats about him, male and female; no getting him away!
I thought he would have run mad of the black boy in Bucklers-bury, that
takes the scury, roguy tobacco, there.


IOH. You say true, Master Numpes: there is such a one indeed.


WAS. It Is no matter, whether there be, or no, what is that to you?


QVAR. He will not allow of John's reading at any hand,


ACT. I. SCENE. V.
COKES. Mistress OVER-DOO. WASPE. GRACE. QVARLOVS. WIN-WIFE. JOHN. WIN. O
Numpes! are you here Numpes? look where I am, Numpes! and Mistress Grace, too!
nay, do not look angerly, Numpes: my Sister is here, and all, I do not come
without her.


WAS. What, the mischief, do you come with her? or she with you?


COK. We came all to seek you, Numpes.


WAS. To seek me? why, did you all think I was lost? or run away with your
fourteen shillings worth of small ware, here? or that I had changed it in the
Fair, for hobby-horses? S'pretious -- to seek me!


OVER. Nay, good Mr Numpes, do you show discretion, though he be exorbitant,
(as Mr Ouer-doo says,) and't be but for conservation of the peace.


WAS. Mary gip, goody she- Justice, Mistress French-hood! turd in your teeth; and
turd in your French-hoods teeth, too, to do you service, do you see? must you
quote your Adam to me! you think, you are Madam Regent still, Mistress
Ouer-doo; when I am in place? no such matter, I assure you, your reign is out,
when I am in, Dame.


OVER. I am content to be in abeyance, Sir, and be governed by you; so should
he too, if he did well; but 'twill be expected, you should also govern your
passions.


WAS. Will It so forsooth? good Lord! how sharp you are! with being at Bet'lem
yesterday? VVhetston has set an edge upon you, has he?


OVER. Nay, if you know not what belongs to your dignity: I do, yet, to mine.


WAS. Very well, then.


COK. Is this the License, Numpes? for Loves sake, let me see it. I never saw a
License.


WAS. Did you not so? why, you shall not see it, then.


COK. An' you love me, good Numpes.


WAS. Sir, I love you, and yet I do not love you, i'these fooleries, set your
heart at rest; there is nothing in it, but hard words: and what would you see it
for?


COK. I would see the length and the breadth on it, that is all; and I will see it
now, so I will.


WAS. You sha' not see it, here.


COK. Then I Will see it at home, and I Will look vpo' the case here.


WAS. Why, do so, a man must give way to him a little in trifles: Gentlemen.
These are errors, diseases of youth: which he will mend, when he comes to
judgment, and knowledge of matters. I pray you conceive so, and I thank you.
And I pray you pardon him, and I thank you again.


QVAR. Well, this dry-nurse, I say still, is a delicate man.


WIN-W. And I, am, for the Cosset, his charge! Did you ever see a fellows face
more accuse him for an Ass?


QVAR. Accuse him? it confesses him one without accusing. What pity it is
yonder wench should marry such a Cokes?


WIN-W. It Is true.


QVAR. She seems to be discreet, and as sober as she is handsome.


WIN-W. I, and if you mark her, what a restrained scorn she casts upon all
his behavior, and speeches?


COK. Well, Numpes, I am now for another piece of business more, the Fair,
Numpes, and then --


WAS. Bless me! deliver me, help, hold me! the Fair!


COK. Nay, never fidge up and down, Numpes, and vex it self. I am resolute
Bartholmew, in this; I Will make no suite on it to you; 'twas all the end of my
journey, indeed, to show Mistress Grace my Fair: I called my Fair, because of
Bartholmew: you know my name is Bartholmew, and Bartholmew Fair.


IOH. That was mine before, Gentlemen: this morning. I had that in faith, upon
his License, believe me, there he comes, after me.


QVAR. Come, John, this ambitious wit of yours, (I am afraid) will do you no
good in the end.


IOH. No? why Sir?


QVAR. You grow so insolent with it, and ouerdoing, John: that if you look not
to it, and tie it up, it will bring you to some obscure place in time, and
there'twill leave you.


WIN-W. Do not trust it too much, John, be more sparing, and use it, but now
and then; a wit is a dangerous thing, in this age; do not over buy it.


IOH. Think you so, Gentlemen? I Will take heed on it, hereafter.


WIN. Yes, do John.


COK. A pretty little soul, this same Mistress Little-wit! would I might marry
her.


GRA. So would I, or any body else, so I might escape you,


COK. Numps, I will see it, Numpes, it is decreed: never be melancholy for the
matter.


WAS. Why, see it, Sir, see it, do see it! who hinders you? why do you not
go see it? 'Slid see it.


COK. The Fair, Numps, the Fair.


WAS. Would the Fair and all the Drums, and Rattles in it, were in your belly
for me: they are already in your brain: he that had the means to travel you
head, now, should meet finer sights then any are in the Fair; and make a finer
voyage on it; to see it all hung with cockle-shels, pebbles, fine wheat-strawes,
and here and there a chicken's feather, and a cob-web.


QVAR. Goodfaith, he looks, me thinks an' you mark him, like one that were
made to catch flies, with his Sir Cranion-legs.


WIN-W. And his Numpes, to flap 'hem away.


WAS. God, be w'you, Sir, there is your Be in a box, and much good do it, you.


COK. Why, your friend, and Bartholmew; an' you be so contumacious.


QVAR. What mean you, Numpes?


WAS. I Will not be guilty, I, Gentlemen.


OVER. You will not let him go, Brother, and loose him?


COK. Who can hold that will away? I had rather loose him then the Fair, I
wusse.


WAS. You do not know the inconvenience, Gentlemen, you persuade to: nor what
trouble I have with him in these humors. If he go to the Fair, he will buy
of every thing, to a Baby there; and household stuff for that too. If a leg
or an arm on him did not grow on, he would lose it in the press. Pray heaven
I bring him off with one stone! And then he is such a Rauener after fruit! you
will not believe what a coil I had, the other day, to compound a business
between a Katerne-peare-woman, and him, about snatching! it is intolerable,
Gentlemen.


WIN-W. O! but you must not leave him, now, to these hazards, Numpes.


WAS. Nay, he knows too well, I will not leave him, and that makes him
presume: well, Sir, will you go now? if you have such an itch in your feet, to
foot it to the Fair, why do you stop, am I your Tarriars? go, will you go?
Sir, why do you not go?


COK. O Numps! have I brought you about? come Mistress Grace, and Sister, I am
resolute Batt, in faith, still.


GRA. Truly, I have no such fancy to the Fair; nor ambition to see it;
there is none goes thither of any quality or fashion.


COK. O Lord, Sir! you shall pardon me, Mistress Grace, we are inow of our
selves to make it a fashion: and for qualities, let Numps alone, he will find
qualities.


QVAR. What a Rogue in apprehension is this! to understand her language no
better.


WIN-W. I, and offer to marry to her? well, I will leave the chase of my
widow, for to day, and directly to the Fair. These flies (...) this hot
season, but engender us excellent creeping sport. (...) man that has but a
spoone full of brain, would think ^o ^arewell, John.


IOH. Win, you see, it is in fashion, to go to the Fair, Win: we ^u^t to the
Fair too, you, and I, Win. I have an affair in the Fair, (...), a Puppet-play
of mine own making, say nothing, that I writ for ^he motion man, which you
must see, Win.


WIN. I would I might John, but my mother will never consent to such a profane
motion: she will call it.


IOH. Tut, we'll have a device, a dainty one; (Now, Wit, help at a pinch, good
Wit come, come, good Wit, and't be thy will.) I have it, Win, I have it
'ifaith, and it is a fine one. Win, long to eat of a Pigge, sweet Win, in the
Fair; do you see? in the heart of the Fair; not at Pye-Corner. Your mother
will do any thing, Win, to satisfy your longing, you know, pray thee long,
presently, and be sick of the sudden, good Win. I Will go in and tell her, cut
thy lace in the mean time, and play the Hypocrite, sweet Win.


WIN. No, I Will not make me unready for it. I can be Hypocrite enough, though I
were never so straight laced.


IOH. You say true, you have bin bred in the family, and brought up to it. Our
mother is a most elect Hypocrite, and has maintained us all this seven year
with it, like Gentle-folkes.


WIN. I, Let her alone, John, she is not a wise wilful widow for nothing, nor
a sanctified sister for a song. And let me alone too, I have somewhat of the
mother in me, you shall see, fetch her, fetch her, ah, ah.


ACT. I. SCENE. VI.
PVRECRAFT. WIN. JOHN. BVSY. SOLOMON. NOw, the blaze of the beauteous
discipline, fright away this evil from our house! how now Win-the-fight,
Child: how do you? Sweet child, speak to me.


WIN. Yes, forsooth.


PVR. Look up, sweet Win-the-fight, and suffer not the enemy to enter you at
this door, remember that your education has bin with the purest, what polluted
one was it, that named first the unclean beast, Pigge, to you, Child?


WIN. (Vh, vh.)


IOH. Not I, of my sincerity, mother: she longed above three hours, ere she
would let me know it; who was it Win?


WIN. A profane black thing with a beard, John.


PVR. O! resist it, Win-the-fight, it is the Tempter, the wicked Tempter, you
may know it by the fleshly motion of Pig, be strong against it, and it is foul
temptations, in these assaults, whereby it broacheth flesh and blood, as it
were, on the weaker side, and pray against it is carnal prouocations, good
child, sweet child, pray.


IOH. Good mother, I pray you; that she may eat some Pigge, and her belly
full, too; and do not you cast away your own child, and perhaps one of mine,
with your tale of the Tempter: how do you, Win? Are you not sick?


WIN. Yes, a great deal, John, (vh, vh.)


PVR. What shall we do? call our zealous brother Busy hither, for his
faithful fortification in this charge of the adversary; child, my dear
child, you shall eat Pigge, be comforted, my sweet child.


WIN. I, but in the Fair, mother.


PVR. I mean in the Fair, if it can be any way made, or found lawful; where
is our brother Busy? Will he not come? look up, child.


IOH. Presently, mother, as soon as he has cleans'd his beard. I found him,
fast by the teeth, in the cold Turkey-pye, in the cupbord, with a great white
loaf on his left hand, and a glass of Malmesey on his right.


PVR. Slander not the Brethren, wicked one.


IOH. Here he is, now, purified, Mother.


PVR. O brother Busy! your help here to edify, and raise us up in a scruple;
my daughter Win-the-fight is visited with a natural disease of women; called,
A longing to eat Pigge.


IOH. I Sir, a Bartholmew-pigge: and in the Fair.


PVR. And I would be satisfied from you, Religiously-wise, whether a widow of
the sanctified assembly, or a widows daughter, may commit the act, without
offense to the weaker sisters.


BVS. Verily, for the disease of longing, it is a disease, a carnal disease,
or appetite, incident to women: and as it is carnal, and incident, it is
natural, very natural: Now Pigge, it is a meat, and a meat that is
nourishing, and may be longed for, and so consequently eaten; it may be eaten;
very exceeding well eaten: but in the Fair, and as a Bartholmew-pig, it cannot
be eaten, for the very calling it a Bartholmew-pigge, and to eat it so, is a
spice of Idolatry, and you make the Fair, no better then one of the high
Places. This I take it, is the state of the question. A high place.


IOH. I, but in state of necessity: Place should give place, Mr* Busy, (I have
a conceit left, yet.)


PVR. Good Brother, Zeale-of-the-land, think to make it as lawful as you can.


IOH. Yes Sir, and as soon as you can: for it must be Sir; you see the danger
my little wife is in, Sir.


PVR. Truly, I do love my child dearly, and I would not have her miscarry,
or hazard her first fruits, if it might be otherwise.


BVS. Surely, it may be otherwise, but it is subject, to construction, subject,
and has a face of offense, with the weak, a great face, a foul face, but
that face may have a veil put over it, and be shaddowed, as it were, it may be
eaten, and in the Fair, I take it, in a Booth, the tents of the wicked: the
place is not much, not very much, we may be religious in midst of the profane,
so it be eaten with a reformed mouth, with sobriety, and humbleness; not
gorged in with gluttony, or greediness; there is the fear: for, should she go
there, as taking pride in the place, or delight in the unclean dressing, to
feed the vanity of the eye, or the lust of the palate, it were not well, it were
not fit, it were abominable, and not good.


IOH. Nay, I knew that before, and told her on it, but courage, Win, we'll be
humble enough; we'll seek out the homeliest Booth in the Fair, that is
certain, rather then fail, we will eat it of the ground.


PVR. I, and I Will go with you my self, Win the-fight, and my brother,
Zeale-of-the-land, shall go with us too, for our better consolation.


WIN. Vh, vh.


IOH. I, and Solomon too, Win, (the more the merrier) Win, we'll leave Rabby
Busy in a Booth. Solomon, my cloak.


SAL. Here, Sir.


BVS. In the way of comfort to the weak, I will go, and eat. I will eat
exceedingly, and prophecy; there may be a good use made of it, too, now I
think on it: by the public eating of Swines flesh, to profess our hate, and
loathing of Iudaisme, whereof the brethren stand taxed. I will therefore eat,
yea, I will eat exceedingly.


IOH. Good, in faith, I will eat heartily too, because I will be no Jew, I
could never away with that stiffenecked generation: and truly, I hope my
little one will be like me, that cries for Pigge so, in the mothers belly.


BVS. Very likely, exceeding likely, very exceeding likely.


ACT. II. SCENE. I.
JUSTICE OVERDOO. WEll, in Justice name, and the Kings; and for the
commonwealth! defy all the world, Adam Ouerdoo, for a disguise, and all
story; for thou have fitted thy self, I swear; feign would I meet the Linccus
now, that Eagles eye, that peircing Epidaurian serpent (as my Quint. Horace
cal's him) that could discover a Justice of Peace, (and lately of the Quorum)
under this covering. They may have seen many a fool in the habit of a
Justice; but never till now, a Justice in the habit of a fool. Thus must we
do, though, that wake for the public good: and thus has the wise Magistrate
done in all ages. There is a doing of right out of wrong, if the way be found.
Never shall I enough commend a worthy worshipful man, sometime a capital
member of this City, for his high wisdom, in this point, who would take you,
now the habit of a Porter; now of a Carman; now of the Dog-killer, in this
month of August; and in the winter, of a Seller of tinder-boxes; and what
would he do in all these shapes? mary go you into every Alehouse, and down
into every Celler; measure the length of puddings, take the gage of black
pots, and cannes, I, and custards with a stick; and their circumference, with
a third; weigh the loaves of bread on his middle-finger; then would he send for
'hem, home; give the puddings to the poor, the bread to the hungry, the
custards to his children; break the pots, and burn the cannes, himself; he
Would not trust his corrupt officers; he would do it himself. would all men in
authority would follow this worthy president! For (alas) as we are public
persons, what do we know? nay, what can we know? we hear with other men's
ears; we see with other men's eyes? a foolish Constable, or a sleepy Watchman,
is all our information, he slanders a Gentleman, by the virtue of his place,
(as he calls it) and we by the vice of ours, must believe him. As a while
agone, they made me, yea me, to mistake an honest zealous Pursiuant, for a
Seminary: and a proper young Batcheler of Music, for a Bawd. This we are
subject to, that live in high place, all our intelligence is idle, and most of
our intelligencers, knaves: and by your leave, our selves, thought little
better, if not errant fools, for believing 'hem. I Adam Ouerdoo, am resolved
therefore, to spare spy-money hereafter, and make mine own discoueries. Many
are the yearly enormities of of this Fair, in whose courts of Pye-pouldres I
have had the honor during the three days sometimes to sit as Judge. But this
is the special day for detection of those foresaid enormities. Here is my
black book, for the purpose; this the cloud that hides me: under this covert
I shall see, and not be seen. On Iunius Brutus. And as I began, so I Will end:
in Justice name, and the Kings; and for the Commonwealth.

Passengers. THe Fayre's pestlence dead, me thinks; people come not abroad, to
day, what ever the matter is. Do you hear, Sister Trash, Lady of the Basket?
sit farther with your ginger-bread-progeny there, and hinder not the prospect
of my shop, or I Will have it proclaimed in the Fair, what stuff they are made on.


TRA. Why, what stuff are they made on, Brother Leather-head? nothing but
what is wholesome, I assure you.


LEA. Yes, stale bread, rotten eggs, musty ginger, and dead honey, you know.


IVS. I! have I met with enormity, so soon?


LEA. I shall mar your market, old Ione.


TRA. Mar my market, thou too-proud Peddler? do thy worst; I defy thee, I,
and thy stable of hobby-horses. I pay for my ground, as well as thou do, and
thou wrong'st me for all thou art parcell-poet, and an Inginer. I Will find a
friend shall right me, and make a ballad of thee, and thy cattle all over. Are
you puffed up with the pride of your wares? your Arsedine?


LEA. Go to, old Ione, I Will talk with you anon; and take you down too,
before Justice Ouerdoo, he is the man must charm you, I Will have you in the
Piepouldres.


TRA. Charm me? I Will meet thee face to face, before his worship, when thou
dare: and though I be a little crooked of my body, I Will be found as upright in
my dealing, as any woman in Smithfield, I, charm me?


IVS. I am glad, to hear, my name is their terror, yet, this is doing of
Justice.


LEA. What do you lack? what is it you buy? what do you lack? Rattles, Drums,
Halberts, Horses, Babies o^the best? Fiddles o'th finest? Enter Cost.


COS. Buy any pears, pears, fine, very fine pears.


TRA. Buy any ginger-bread, guilt ginger-beard!


NIG. Hey, now the Fayre's a filling!
O, for a Tune to startle
The Birds of the Booths here billing*
Yearly with old Saint Barthle!
The Drunkards they are wading,
The Punques, and Chapmen trading;
Who'ld see the Fair without his lading? Buy any ballads; new ballads?

VRS. Fie upon it: who would wear out their youth, and prime thus, in roasting
of pigges, that had any cooler vocation? Hell's a kind of cold cellar to t, a
very fine vault, of my conscience! what Moone-calfe.


MOo. Here, Mistress.


NIG. How now Vrsla? in a heat, in a heat?


VRS. My chair, you false faucet you; and my mornings draught, quickly, a
botle of Ale, to quench me, Rascal. I am all sire, and fat, Nightingale, I
shall even melt away to the first woman, a ribbe again, I am afraid. I do
water the ground in knots, as I go, like a great Garden-pot, you may follow me
by the S.S.s. I make.


NIG. Alas, good Vr's; was Zekiel here this morning?


VRS. Zekiel? what Zekiel?


NIG. Zekiel Edgeworth, the civil cutpurse, you know him well enough; he
that talks bawdy to you still: I call him my Secretary.


VRS. He promised to be here this morning, I remember.


NIG. When he comes, bid him stay: I Will be back again presently.


VRS. Best take your mornings dew in your belly, Nightingale, come, Moon-calfe
brings in the Chair. Sir, set it here, did not I bid you should get this
chair let out of the sides, for me, that my hips might play? you will never
think of any thing, till your dame be rumpgall'd; it is well, Changeling:
because it can take in your Grasse-hoppers thighs, you care for no more. Now,
you look as you had been in the corner of the Booth, fleaing your breech, with
a candles end, and set fire of the Fair. Fill, Stote: fill.


IVS. This Pig-woman do I know, and I will put her in, for my second enormity,
she has been before me, Punke, Pinnace and Bawd, any time these two and
twenty years, upon record in the Pie-poudres.


VRS. Fill again, you unlucky vermin.


MOO. 'Pray you be not angry, Mistress, I Will have it widen'd anon.


VRS. No, no, I shall even dwindle away to it, ere the Fair be done, you
think, now you have heated me? A poor vexed thing I am, I feel my self
dropping already, as fast as I can: two stone a sewet aday is my proportion: I
can but hold life and soul together, with this (here is to you, Nightingale)
and a whiffe of tobacco, at most. Where Is my pipe now? not filled? thou errant
Incubee.


NIG. Nay, Vrsla, thou wilt gall between the tongue and the teeth, with
fretting, now.


VRS. How can I hope, that ever he will discharge his place of trust, Tapster, a
man of reckoning under me, that remembers nothing I say to him? but look
to it, sirrah, you were best, three pence a pipe full, I will have made, of all
my whole half pound of tobacco, and a quarter of a pound of Coltsfoot, mixed
with it too, to itch it out. I that have dealt so long in the fire, will not be
to seek in smoke, now. Then 6. and 20. shillings a barrel I will advance of my
Beer; and fifty shillings a hundred of my bottle-ale, I ha'told you the ways
how to raise it. Froth your cannes well in the filling, at length Rogue, and
iogge your bottles of the buttocke, Sirrah, then skinke out the first glass,
ever, and drink with all companies, though you be sure to be drunk; you will
mis-reckon the better, and be less ashamed on it. But your true trick,
Rascal, must be, to be ever busy, and mis-take away the bottles and cannes,
in have, before they be half drunk off, and never hear any body call, (if
they should chance to mark you) till you have brought fresh, and be able to
forswear 'hem. Give me a drink of Ale.


IVS. This is the very womb, and bed of enormitie! gross, as her self!
this must all down for enormity, all, every whit on it.


VRS. Look, who is there, Sirrah? One knocks. five shillings a Pigge is my
price, at least; if it be a sow-pig, six pence more* if she be a great bellied
wife, and long for it, six pence more for that.


IVS. O Tempora! O mores! I would not have lost my discovery of this one
grieuance, for my place, and worship of the Bench, how is the poor subject
abused, here! well, I will fall in with her, and with her Moone-calfe, and
win out wonders of enormity. By thy leave, goodly woman, and the fatness of
the Fair: oily as the Kings constables Lamp, and shining as his
Shooing-horne! has thy Ale virtue, or thy Beer strength? that the tongue of
man may be tickled? and his palate pleased in the morning? let thy pretty Nephew
here, go search and see.


VRS. What new Roarer is this?


MOO. O Lord! do you not know him, Mistress, it is mad Arthur of Bradley, that
makes the Orations* Brave Master, old Arthur of Bradley, how do you? welcome
to the Fair, when shall we hear you again, to handle your matters? with
your back again a Booth, ha? I have bin one o'your little disciples, i'my
days!


IVS. Let me drink, boy, with my love, thy Aunt, here; that I may be eloquent:
but of thy best, lest it be bitter in my mouth, and my words fall foul on the
Fair.


VRS. Why do thou not fetch him drink? and offer him to sit?


MOO. Is It Ale, or Beer? Master Arthur?


IVS. Thy best, pretty stripling, thy best; the same thy Dove drinks, and
thou drawest on holy days.


VRS. Bring him a six penny bottle of Ale; they say, a fools handsell is
lucky.


IVS. Bring both, child. Ale for Arthur, and Beer for Bradley. Ale for thine
Aunt, boy. My disguise takes to the very wish, and reach of it. I shall by the
benefit of this, discover enough, and more: and yet get off with the reputation
of what I would be. A certain midling thing, between a fool and a madman.


ACT. II. SCENE. III.
KNOCKHVM. to them. WHat! my little lean Vrsla! my shee-Beare! art thou alive
yet? with thy litter of pigges, to grunt out another Bartholmew Fair? ha!


VRS. Yes, and to amble afoote, when the Fair is done, to hear you groan out
of a cart, up the heavy hill.


KNO. Of Holbourne, Vrsla, meanst thou so? for what? for what, pretty Vrs?


VRS. For cutting halfe-penny purses: or stealing little penny dogs, out
of the Fair.


KNO. O! good words, good words Vrs.


IVS. Another special enormitie. A cutpurse of the sword! the boot, and the
feather! those are his marks.


VRS. You are one of those horsleaches, that gave out I was dead, in Turne-bull
street, of a surfeit of botle ale, and tripes?


KNO. No, 'twas better meat Vrs: cowes vdders, cowes vdders!


VRS. Well, I shall be meet with your mumbling mouth one day.


KNO. What? thou wilt poison me with a neuft in a bottle of Ale, will it thou? or
a spider in a tobacco-pipe, Vrs? Come, there is no malice in these fat folks, I
never fear thee, and I can escape thy lean Moonecalfe here. Let Us drink it
out, good Vrs, and no vapors!


IVS. Do thou hear, boy? (there is for thy Ale, and the remnant for thee)
speak in thy faith of a faucet, now; is this goodly person before us here,
this vapors, a knight of the knife?


MOO. What mean you by that, Master Arthur?


IVS. I mean a child of the horne-thumb, a babe of booty, boy; a cutpurse.


MOO. O Lord, Sir! far from it. This is Master Dan. Knockhum: Iordane the
Ranger of Turnebull. He is a horse-courser, Sir.


IVS. Thy dainty dame, though, called him cutpurse.


MOO. Like enough, Sir, she will do forty such things in an hour (an you
listen to her) for her recreation, if the toy take her in the greasy kerchiefe:
it makes her fat you see. She battens with it.


IVS. Here might I ha'beene deceived, now: and ha'put a fools blot upon my
self, if I had not played an after game of discretion.


KNO. Alas poor Vrs, this's an ill season for thee. Vrsla comes in again
dropping.


VRS. Hang your self, Hacney-man.


KNO. How? how? Vrs, vapors! motion breed vapors?


VRS. Vapors? Never tuske, nor twirle your dibble, good Iordane, I know what
you will take to a very drop. Though you be Captain of the Roarers, and fight
well at the case of pis-pots, you shall not fright me with your Lyon-chap, Sir,
nor your tuskes, you angry? you are hungry: come, a pigs head will stop your
mouth, and stay your stomach, at all times.


KNO. Thou art such another mad merry Vrs still! Troth I do make conscience of
vexing thee, now in the dog-daies, this hot weather, for fear of foundring thee
in the body; and melting down a Pillar of the Fair. Pray thee take thy chair
again, and keep state; and let us have a fresh bottle of Ale, and a pipe of
tobacco; and no vapors. I Will have this belly o'thine taken up, and thy grass
scoured, wench; look! here is Ezechiel Edgworth; a fine boy of his inches, as
any is in the Fair! has still money in his purse, and will pay all, with a kind
heart; and good vapors.


ACT. II. SCENE. IIII.
To them EDGVVORTH. NIGHTINGALE. Corne-cutter. Tinder-box-man. Passengers. THat
I will, indeed, willingly, Master Knockhum, fetch some Ale, and Tobacco.


LEA. What do you lack, Gentlemen? Maid: see a fine hobby horse for your
young Master: cost you but a token a week his prouander.


COR. Have you any corns 'iyour feet, and toes?


TIN. Buy a Mouse-trap, a Mouse-trap, or a Tormentor for a Flea.


TRA. Buy some Ginger-bread.


NIG. Ballads, Ballads! fine new ballads:

Hear for your love, and buy for your money.
A delicate ballad of the Ferret and the Coney.
A preservative again' the Punques evil.
Another of Goose-greene-starch, and the Devil.
A dozen of divine points, and the Godly garters.
The Fairing of good council, of an ell and three quarters. What is it you buy?
The Windmill blown down by the witches fart!
Or Saint George, that O! did break the Dragons heart!

EDG. Master Nightingale, come hither, leave your mart a little.


NIG. O my Secretary! what says my Secretary?


IVS. Child of the bottles, what is he? what he?


MOO. A civil young Gentleman, Master Arthur, that keeps company with the
Roarers, and disburses all, still. He has ever money in his purse; He pays for
them; and they roar for him: one does good offices for another. They call him
the Secretary, but he serves no body. A great friend of the Ballad-mans they
are never asunder.


IVS. What pity it is, so civil a young man should haunt this debaucht
company? here is the bane of the youth of our time apparent. A proper penman, I
see it in his countenance, he has a good Clerks look with him, and I warrant
him a quick hand.


MOO. A very quick hand, Sir.


EDG. All the purses, and purchase, I give you to day by conueyance, bring
hither to Vrsla's presently. This they whisper, that Ouerdoo hears it not.
Here we will meet at night in her ^odge, and share. Look you choose good
places, for your standing in the Fair, when you sing, Nightingale.


VRS. I, near the fullest passages; and shift'hem often.


EDG. And in your singing, you must use your hawks eye nimbly, and fly the
purse to a mark, still, where it is worn, and o'which side; that you may gi'me
the sign with your beak, or hang your head that way in the tune.


VRS. Enough, talk no more on it: your friendship (Masters) is not now to
begin. Drink your draught of Indenture, your sup of Covenant, and away, the
Fair fills apace, company begins to come in, and I have never a Pigge ready, yet.


KNO. Well said! fill the cups, and light the tobacco: let us give fire in the
works, and noble vapors.


EDG. And shall we have smockes Vrsla, and good whimsies, ha?


VRS. Come, you are in your bawdy vain! the best the Fair will afford, Zekiel,
if Bawd Whit keep his word; how do the Pigges, Moone-calfe?


MOO. Very passionate, Mistress, one on'hem has wept out an eye. Master Arthur
of Bradley is melancholy, here, no body talks to him. Will you any tobacco
Master Arthur?


IVS. No, boy, let my meditations alone.


MOO. He Is studying for an Oration, now.


IVS. If I can, with this days travel, and all my policy, but rescue this
youth, here, out of the hands of the lewd man, and the strange woman. I will
sit down at night, and say with my friend Ovid, Iamque opus exegi, quod nec
Iouis ira, nec ignis, etc.


KNO. Here Zekiel; here is a health to Vrsla, and a kind vapor, thou have money
i'thy purse still; and store! how do thou come by it? Pray thee vapor thy
friends some in a courteous vapor.


EDG. Half I have, Master Dan. Knockhum, is always at your service,


IVS. Ha, sweet nature! what Goshawke would prey upon such a Lamb?


KNO. Let Us see, what it is, Zekiel! count it, come, fill him to pledge me.


ACT. II. SCENE. V.
WIN-WIFE. QVARLOVS. to them. We are here before 'hem, me thinks.


QVAR. All the better, we shall see 'hem come in now.


LEA. What do you lack, Gentlemen, what is it you lack? a fine Horse? a Lion?
a Bull? a Bear? a Dog, or a Cat? an excellent fine Bartholmew* bird? or an
Instrument? what is it you lack?


QVAR. S'lid! here is Orpheus among the beasts, with his Fiddle, and all!


TRA. Will you buy any comfortable bread, Gentlemen?


QVAR. And Ceres selling her daughters picture, in Ginger-worke!


WIN. That these people should be so ignorant to think us chapmen for 'hem!
do we look as if we would buy Ginger-bread? or Hobby-horses?


QVAR. Why, they know no better ware then they have, nor better customers then
come. And our very being here makes us fit to be demanded, as well as others.
Would Cokes would come! there were a true customer for 'hem.


KNO. How much is it* thirty shillings? who is yonder! Ned Winwife? and Tom
Quarlous, I think! yes, (gi' me it all) (gi' me it all) Master Win-wife!
Master Quarlous! will you take a pipe of tobacco with us? do not discredit me
now, Zekiel.


WIN. Do not see him! he is the roaring horse-courser, pray thee let us avoid
him: turn down this way.


QVAR. S'lud, I Will see him, and roar with him, too, and he roared as loud as
Neptune, pray thee go with me.


WIN. You may draw me to as likely an inconvenience, when you please, as this.


QVAR. Go to then, come along, we have nothing to do, man, but to see sights,
now.


KNO. Welcome Master Quarlous, and Master Winwife! will you take any froth, and
smoke with us?


QVAR. Yes, Sir, but you will pardon us, if we knew not of so much familiarity
between us before.


KNO. As what, Sir?


QVAR. To be so lightly invited to smoke, and ^roth.


KNO. A good vapor! will you sit down, Sir? this is old Vrsla's mansion, how
like you her bower? here you may ha'your Punque, and your Pigge in state, Sir,
both piping hot.


QVAR. I had rather have my Punque, cold, Sir.


IVS. There Is for me, Punque! and Pigge!


VRS. What Moonecalfe? you Rogue. She calls within.


MOO. By and by, the bottle is almost off Mistress, here Master Arthur.


VRS. I Will part you, and your play-fellow there, in the guarded coat, an' you
sunder not the sooner.


KNO. Master Win-wife, you are proud (me thinks) you do not talk, nor
drink, are you proud?


WIN. Not of the company I am in, Sir, nor the place, I assure you.


KNO. You do not except at the company! do you? are you in vapors, Sir?


MOO. Nay, good Master Dan: Knockhum, respect my Mistress Bower, as you call it;
for the honor of our Booth, none o'your vapors, here.


VRS. Why, you thin lean Polcat you, and they have a mind to be i'their
vapors, must you hinder'hem? what did you know Vermin, if they would have lost
a cloak, or such a triflle? She comes out with a firebrand. must you be
drawing the air of pacification here? while I am tormented, within, in the
fire, you Weasell?


MOO. Good Mistress, 'twas in the behalf of your Booth's credit, that I spoke.


VRS, Why? would my Booth have broake, if they had fal'ne out in it? Sir? or
would their heat have fit'd it? in, you Rogue, and wipe the pigges, and mend
the fire, that they fall not, or I Will both baste and roast you, till your eyes
drop out, like 'hem. (Leave the bottle behind you, and be cursed a while.)


QVAR. Body of the Fair! what is this? mother of the Bawds?


KNO. No, she is mother of the Pigs, Sir, mother of the Pigs!


WIN. Mother of the Furies, I think, by her firebrand.


QVAR. Nay, she is too fat to be a Fury, sure, some walking Sow of tallow!


WIN. An inspired vessel of Kitchin-sluffe!


QVAR. She Will make excellent geere for the Coach-makers, She drinks this
while. here in Smithfield, to anoint wheels and axell trees with.


VRS. I, I, Gamesters, mock a plain plumpe soft wench of the Suburbs, do,
because she is iuicy and wholesome: you must have your thin pinched ware, pent
up in the compass of a dogge-collar, (or 'twill not do) that looks like a long
laced Conger, set upright, and a green feather, like fennel in the Ioll on it.


KNO. Well said Vrs, my good Vrs; to 'hem Vrs.


QVAR. Is she your quagmite, Dan: Knockhum? is this your Bogge?


NIG. We shall have a quarrel presently.


KNO. How? Bog? Quagmire? foul vapors! hum'h!


QVAR. Yes, he that would venture for it, I assure him, might sink into her,
and be drowned a week, ere any friend he had, could find where he were.


WIN. And then he would be a fort'night weighing up again.


QVAR. 'Twere like falling into a whole Shire of butter: they had need be a
teeme of Dutchmen, should draw him out.


KNO. Answer 'hem, Vrs, where is thy Bartholmew-wit, now? Vrs, thy
Bartholmew-wit?


VRS. Hang 'hem, rotten, roguy Cheaters, I hope to see 'hem plagued one day
(pox'd they are already, I am sure) with lean playhouse poultry, that has the
boany rumpe, sticking out like the Ace of Spades, or the point of a Partizan,
that every rib of'hem is like the tooth of a Saw: and will so grate 'hem with
their hips, and shoulders, as (take 'hem altogether) they were as good lie with
a hurdle.


QVAR. Out upon her, how she drips! she is able to give a man the sweating
Sickness, with looking on her.


VRS. Mary look off, with a patch o'your face; and a dosen in your breech,
though they be o'scarlet, Sir. I have seen as fine outsides, as either o'yours,
bring lousy linings to the Brokers, ere now, twice a week?


QVAR. Do you think there may be a fine new Cuckingstoole in the Fair, to be
purchased? one large enough, I mean. I know there is a pond of capacity, for
her.


VRS. For your mother, you Rascal, out you Rogue, you hedge bird, you Pimpe,
you pannier-mans bastard, you.


QVAR. Ha, ha, ha.


VRS. Do you sneere, you dogs-head, you Trendle tail! you look as you were
begotten a'top of a Cart in haruest-time, when the whelp was hot and eager. Go,
snuff after your brothers bitch, Mrs Commodity, that is the Liuory you wear,
'twill be out at the elbows, shortly. It Is time you went to it, for the to'ther
remnant.


KNO. Peace, Vrs, peace, Vrs, they will kill the poor Whale, and make oil of
her. Pray thee go in.


VRS. I Will see 'hem pox'd first, and pil'd, and double pil'd.


WIN. Let Us away, her language grows greasier then her Pigs.


VRS. Dos't so, snotty nose? good Lord! are you sniueling? you were engendered
on a she-begger, in a barn, when the bald Thrasher, your Sire, was scarce
warm.


WIN. Pray thee, let us go.


QVAR. No, faith: I Will stay the end of her, now: I know she cannot last long;
I find by her similes, she wanes a pace.


VRS. Does she so? I Will set you gone. Gi' me my Pig-pan hither a little. I Will
scald you hence, and you will not go.


KNO. Gentlemen, these are very strange vapors! and very idle vapors! I
assure you.


QVAR. You are a very serious ass, we assure you.


KNO. Humh! Ass? and serious? nay, then pardon me my vapor. I have a foolish
vapor, Gentlemen: any man that does vapor me, the Ass, Master Quarlous --


QVAR. What then, Master Jordan?


KNO. I do vapor him the lie.


QVAR. Faith, and to any man that vapors me the lie, I do vapor that.


KNO. Nay, then, vapors upon vapors.


EDG. NIG. 'Ware the pan, the pan, the pan, Vrsla comes in, with the
scalding-pan.

They fight. She falls with it.


she comes with the pan, Gentlemen. God bless the woman.


VRS. Oh.


ERA. What Is the matter?


IVS. Goodly woman!


MOO. Mistress!


VRS. Curse of hell, that ever I saw these Feinds, oh! I have scalded my leg, my
leg, my leg, my leg. I have lost a limb in the service! run for some cream and
sallad oil, quickly. Are you vnder-peering, you Baboun? rip off my hose, an'
you be men, men, men.


MOO. Run you for some cream, good mother Ione. I Will look to your basket.


LEA. Best sit up in your chair, Vrsla. Help, Gentlemen.


KNO. Be of good cheer, Vrs, thou have hindered me the currying of a couple of
Stallions, here, that abused the good race- Bawd o'Smithfield; 'twas time for
'hem to go.


NIG. I faith, when the pan came, they had made you run else. (this had
been a fine time for purchase, if you had ventured.)


EDG. Not a whit, these fellows were too fine to carry money.


KNO. Nightingale, get some help to carry her leg out of the air; take off
her shoes; body of me, she has the Mallanders, the scratches, the crown
scabbe, and the quitter bone, in the the other leg.


VRS. Oh! the pox, why do you put me in mind of my leg, thus, to make it
prick, and shoot? would you have me in the Hospital, before my time?


KNO. Patience, Vrs, take a good heart, it is but a blister, as big as a
Windgall; I Will take it away with the white of an egg, a little honey, and hogs
grease, have thy pasternes well rol'd, and thou shall't pase again by to
morrow. I Will tend thy Booth, and look to thy affairs, the while: thou shall
sit i'thy chair, and give directions, and shine Vrsa mayor.


ACT. II. SCENE. VI.
JUSTICE. EDGEWORTH. NIGHTINGALE. COKES. WASPE. Mistress OVERDOO. GRACE. THese
are the fruits of bottle-ale, and tobacco! the some of the one, and the fumes
of the other! Stay young man, and despise not the wisdom of these few hayres,
that are grown gray in care of thee.


EDG. Nightingale, stay a little. Indeed I Will hear some of this!


COK. Come, Numps, come, where are you? welcome into the Fair, Mistress Grace.


EDG. S'light, he will call company, you shall see, and put us into doings
presently.


IVS. Thirst not after that frothy liquor, Ale: for, who knows, when he
opens the stopple, what may be in the bottle? has not a Snaile, a Spider,
yea, a Neuft bin found there? thirst not after it, youth: thirst not after it.


COK. This is a brave fellow, Numps, let us hear him.


WAS. S'blood, how brave is he? in a guarded coat? you were best trucke with
him, even strip, and trucke presently, it will become you, why will you hear
him, because he is an Ass, and may be a kinnne to the Cokeses?


COK. O, good Numps!


IVS. Neither do thou lust after that tawney weed, tobacco.


COK. Brave words!


IVS. Whose complexion is like the Indians that vents it!


COK. Are they not brave words, Sister?


IVS. And who can tell, if, before the gathering, and making up thereof, the
Alligarta has not pissed thereon?


WAS. Heart let 'hem be brave words* as brave as they will! and they were all
the brave words in a Country, how then? will you away yet? ha'you enough on
him? Mistress Grace, come you away, I pray you, be not you accessory. If you do
lose your License, or somewhat else, Sir, with listening to his fables: say,
Numps, is a witch, with all my heart, do, say so.


COK. Avoid in your satin doublet, Numps.


IVS. The creeping venom of which subtle serpent, as some late writers
affirm; neither the cutting of the perrillous plant, nor the drying of it, nor
the lighting, or burning, can any way perssway or, assuage.


COK. Good, in faith! is it not Sister?


IVS. Hence it is, that the lungs of the Tabacconist are rotted, the Liver
spotted, the brain smoked like the backside of the Pig-womans Booth, here,
and the whole body within, black, as her Pan, you saw even now, without.


COK. A sine similitude, that, Sir! did you see the pan?


EDG. Yes, Sir.


IVS. Nay, the hole in the nose here, of some tabacco-takers, or the third
nostrill, (if I may so call it) which makes, that they can vent the tobacco
out, like the Ace of clubs, or rather the Flower-de-lice, is caused from the
tobacco, the mere tobacco! when the poor innocent pox, having nothing to do
there, is miserably, and most unconscionably slandered.


COK. Who would have mist this, Sister?


OVER. Not any body, but Numps.


COK. He does not understand.


EDG. Nor you feel.


COK. What would you have, Sister, He picketh his purse. of a fellow that
knows nothing but a basket-hilt, and an old Fox in it? the best music in the
Fair, will not move a logge.


EDG. In, to Vrsla, Nightingale, and carry her comfort: see it told. This
fellow was sent to us by fortune, for our first fairing.


IVS. But what speak I of the diseases of the body, children of the Fair?


COK. That Is to us, Sister. Brave in faith!


IVS. Hark, O, you sons and daughters of Smithfield! and hear what mallady
it does the mind: It causes swearing, it causes swaggering, it causes
snuffling, and snarling, and now and then a hurt.


OVE. He has something of Master Ouerdo^, me thinks, brother.


COK. So me thought, Sister, very much of my brother Ouerdoo: And it is, when
he speaks.


IVS. Look into any Angle of the town, (the Streights, or the Bermuda's) where
the quarrelling lesson is read, and how do they entertain the time, but with
bottle-ale, and tobacco? The Lecturer is o'one side, and his Pupils of the
other; But the seconds are still bottle ale, and tobacco, for which the
Lecturer reads, and the Nouices pay. Thirty pound a week in bo^^le-ale! forty
in tobacco! and ten more in Ale again. Then for a suit to drink in, so much,
and (that being slauer'd) so much for another suit, and then a third suit, and
a fourth suit! and still the bottle-ale slauereth, and the tobacco stinketh!


WAS. Heart of a madman! are you rooted here? well you never away? what can
any man find out in this bawling fellow, to grow here for? he is a full
handful higher, sin'he heard him, will you fix here? and set up a Booth? Sir?


IVS. I will conclude briefly --


WAS. Hold your peace, you roaring Rascal, I Will run my head in your chaps
else. You were best build a Booth, and entertain him, make your Will, and you
say the word, and him your heir! heart, I never knew one taken with a mouth of
a peeke, before. By this light, I Will carry you away of my back, and you will
not come. He gets him up on pickpacke.


COK. Stay Numpes, stay, set me down: I have lost my purse, Numps, O my purse!
one of my fine purses is gone.


OVER. Is It indeed, brother?


COK. I, as I am an honest man, would I were an errant Rogue, else! a plague of
all roguy, damned cut-purses for me.


WAS. Bless 'hem with all my heart, with all my heart, do you see! Now, as I
am no Infidel, that I know of, I am glad on it. I I am, (here is my witness!)
do you see, Sir? I did not tell you of his fables, I? no, no, I am a dull
malt-horse, I, I know nothing. Are you not justly served in your conscience now?
speak in your conscience. Much good do you with all my heart, and his good
heart that has it, with all my heart again.


EDG. This fellow is very charitable, would he had a purse too! but, I must not
be too bold, all at a time.


COK. Nay, Numps, it is not my best purse.


WAS. Not your best! death! why should it be your worst? why should it be any,
indeed, at all? answer me to that, gi'mee a reason from you, why it should be
any?


COK. Nor my gold, Numps; I have that yet, look here else, Sister.


WAS. Why so, there is all the feeling he has!


OVER. I pray you, have a better care of that, brother.


COK. Nay, so I will, I warrant you; let him catch this, that catch can. I
would ^aine see him get this, look you here.


WAS. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so! Very good.


COK. I would have him come again, now, and but offer at it. Sister, will you
take notice of a good jest? I will put it just where the other was, and if we
have good luck, you shall see a delicate fine trap to catch the cutpurse,
nibling.


EDG. Faith, and he will try ere you be out of the Fair.


COK. Come, Mistress Grace, prithee be not melancholy for my mis-chance;
sorrow wi'not keep it, Sweet heart.


GRA. I do not think on it, Sir.


COOK. 'Twas but a little scuruy white money, hang it: it may hang the
cutpurse, one day. I have gold left to gi'thee a fayring, yet, as hard as the
world goes: nothing angers me, but that no body here, looked like a cutpurse,
unless 'twere Numps.


WAS How? I? I look like a cutpurse? death! your Sister's a cutpurse! and your
mother and father, and all your kin were cutpurses! And here is a Rogue is
the baud of the cutpurses, whom I will beat to begin with.


COK. Numps, Numps.


OVER. Good Mr Humphrey.


WAS. You are the Patrico! are you? the Patriarch of the cutpurses? you share,
Sir, they say, let them share this with you. Are you in your hot fit of
preaching again? I Will cool you.


IVS. Murder, murder, murder.


IVS. Hold thy hand, child of wrath, and heir of anger, They speak all
together: and Waspe beats the Justice. make it not Childermasse day in thy
fury, or the feast of the French Bartholmew, Parent of the of the Massacre.

you met the man with the monsters, and I could not get you from him. An old

WHI. And she shall show tee as fine cut o'rke fort't in her shmock too, as
tou cansht vishe in faith; vilt tou have her, vorshipfull Vin vife? I will help
tee to her, here, be an't be, in te pig-quarter* gi'me ty twelpence from tee,


WIN-W. Why, there is twelpence, pray thee will thou be gone.


WHI, Tou art a vorthy man, and a vorshipfull man still.


QVAR. Get you gone, Rascal.


WHI. I do mean it, man. Prinsh Quarlous if tou has^t need on me, tou shall
find me here, at Vrsla's, I will see phat ale, and punque ish i'te pigshty,
for tee, bless ty good vorship.


QVAR. Look! who comes here! John Little-wit!


WIN-W. And his wife, and my widow, her mother: the whole family.


QVAR. 'Slight, you must gi'hem all fairings, now!


WIN-W. Not I, I Will not see 'hem,


QVAR. They are going a feasting. What Schole-master's that ^s with 'hem?


WIN-W. That Is my Rival, I believe, the Baker!


BVS. So, walk on in the middle way, fore-right, turn neither to the right
hand, nor to the left: let not your eyes be drawn aside with vanity, nor your
ear with noyses.


QVAR. O, I know him by that start!


LEA. What do you lack? what do you buy, pretty Mistress! a fine Hobbyhorse, to
make your son a Tilter? a Drum to make him a Soldier? a Fiddle, to make him
a Reueller? What is it you lack? Little Dogs for your Daughters! or Babies,
male, or female?


BVS. Look not toward them, harken not: the place is Smithfield, or the field
of Smiths, the Grove of Hobbi-horses and trinkets, the wares are the wares of
devils. And the whole Fair is the shop of Satan! They are hooks, and baits,
very baits, that are hung out on every side, to catch you, and to hold you as
it were, by the gills; and by the nostrills, as the Fisher does: therefore, you
must not look, nor turn toward them -- The Heathen man could stop his ears
with wax, against the harlot of the sea: Do you the like, with your fingers
against the bells of the Beast.


WIN-W. What flashes comes from him!


QVAR. O, he has those of his oven! a notable hot Baker 'twas, when he plied
the peele: he is leading his flock into the Fair, now.


WIN-W. Rather driving 'hem to the Pens: for he will let 'hem look upon
nothing.


KNO. Gentlewomen, the weather's hot! whither walk you? Have a care o'your
fine velvet caps, the Fair is dusty. Take a sweet delicate Booth, Little-wit
is gazing at the sign; which is the Pigs-head with a large writing under it.
with boughs, here, ithe way, and cool your selves in the shade: you and your
friends. The best pig and bottle-ale in the Fair, Sir. Old Vrsla is Cook,
there you may read: the pigges head speaks it. Poor soul, she has had a
Sringhalt, the Maryhinchco: but she is prettily amended.


WHI. A delicate show-pig, little Mistress, with shweet sauce, and crackling,
like de bay-leafe i would fire, la! Tou shall ha'de clean side o'de table-clot
and di glass vash'd with phatersh of Dame Annessh Clear.


IOH. This's sine, verily, here be the best pigs: and she does roast 'hem as
well as ever she did; the Pigs head says.


KNO. Excellent, excellent, Mistress, with fire of Juniper and Rosemary
branches! The Oracle of the Pigs head, that, Sir.


PVR. Son, were you not warned of the vanity of the eye? have you forgot the
wholesome admonition, so soon?


IOH. Good mother, how shall we find a pigge, if we do not look about for it?
will it run off of the spit, into our mouths think you? as in Lubberland? and
cry, we, we?


BVS. No, but your mother, religiously wise, conceiueth it may offer it self,
by other means, to the sense, as by way of steeme which I think it does, here
in this place (Huh, huh) yes, it does. and it were a sin of obstinacy, Busy
sents after it like a Hound. great obstinacy, high and horrible obstinacy, to
decline, or resist the good titillation of the famelick sense, which is the
smell. Therefore be bold (huh, huh, huh) follow the sent. Enter the Tents of
the unclean, for once, and satisfy your wives frailty. Let your frail wife
be satisfied: your zealous mother, and my suffering self, will also be
satisfied.


IOH. Come, Win, as good winny here, as go farther, and see nothing.


BVS. We escape so much of the other vanities, by our early entering.


PVR. It is an aedifying consideration.


WIN. This is scuruy, that we must come into the Fair, and not look on it.


IOH. Win, have patience, Win, I Will tell you more anon.


KNO. Moone-calfe, entertain within there, the best pig in the Booth; a
Porklike pig. These are Banbury-bloods, of the sincere stud, come a
pigge-hunting. Whit, wait Whit, look to your charge.


BVS. A pigge prepare, presently, let a pigge be prepared to us.


MOo. S'light, who be these?


VRS. Is this the good service, Jordan, you would do me?


KNO. Why, Vrs? why, Vrs? thou wilt have vapors i'thy leg again presently,
pray thee go in, 't may turn to the scratches else.


VRS. Hang your vapors, they are stale, and stink like you, are these the
guests of the game, you promised to fill my pit withal, to day?


KNO. I^ what aile they Vrs?


VRS. Aile they? they are all sippers, sippers of the City, they look as they
would not drink off two penn'orth of bottle-ale amongst 'hem.


MOO. A body may read that i'their small printed ruffes.


KNO. Away, thou art a fool, Vrs, and thy Moone-calfe too, in your ignorant
vapors, now? hence, good guests, I say right hypocrites, good gluttons. In,
and set a couple o'pigs of the board, and half a dozen of the biggest bottles
before 'hem, and call Whit, I do not love to hear Innocents abused: Fine
ambling hypocrites! and a stone-puritane, with a sorrel head, and beard, good
mouthed gluttons: two to a pigge, away.


VRS. Are you sure they are such?


KNO. Of The right breed, thou shall try 'hem by the teeth, Vrs, where is this
Whit?


WHI. Behold, man and see, what a worthy man am ee!
With the fury of my sword, and the shaking of my beard,
I will make ten thousand men afeard.

KNO. Well said, brave Whit, in, and fear the ale out of the bottles, into the
bellies of the brethren, and the sisters drink to the cause, and pure vapors.


QVAR. My Roarer is turned Tapster, me thinks. Now were a fine time for thee,
Win-wife, to lay aboard thy widow, thou wilt never be Master of a better season,
or place; she that will venture her self into the Fair, and a pig-boxe, will
admit any assault, be assured of that.


WIN. I love not enterprises of that suddenness, though.


QVAR. I Will warrant thee, then, no wife out of the widows Hundred: if I had
but as much Title to her, as to have breathed once on that straight stomacher
of hers, I would now assure my self to carrry her, yet, ere shewent out of
Smithfield. Or she should carry me, which were the fitter sight, I confess.
But you are a modest undertaker, by circumstances, and degrees; come, it is
Disease in thee, not Judgment, I should offer at all together. Look, here is
the poor fool, again, that was stung by the waspe, ere while.


ACT. III. SCENE. III.
JUSTICE. WIN-WIFE. QVARLOVS. I will make no more orations, shall draw on these
tragical conclusions. And I begin now to think, that by a spice of
collateral Justice, Adam Ouerdoo, deserved this beating; for I the said Adam,
was one cause (a by-cause) why the purse was lost: and my wives brothers purse
too, which they know not of yet. But I shall make very good mirth with it, at
supper, (that will be the sport) and put my little friend, Mr Humphrey Wasp's
choler quite out of countenance. When, sitting at the upper end of my Table, as
I use, and drinking to my brother Cokes, and Mrs. Alice Ouerdoo, as I will, my
wife, for their good affection to old Bradley, I deliver to'hem, it was I, that
was cudgelled, and show 'hem the marks. To see what bad events may peep out
of the tail of good purposes! the care I had of that civil young man, I took
fancy to this morning, (and have not left it yet) drew me to that exhortation,
which drew the company, indeeede, which drew the ^ut-purse; which drew the
money; which drew my brother Cokes his loss; which drew on Wasp's anger; which
drew on my beating: a pretty gradation! And they shall have it i'their dish,
in faith, at night for fruit: I love to be merry at my Table. I had thought
once, at one special blow he ga'me, to have revealed my self? but then (I
thank thee fortitude) I remembered that a wise man (and who is ever so great a
part, of the Commonwealth in himself) for no particular disaster ought to
abandon a public good design. The husbandman ought not for one unthankful
year, to forsake the plough; The Shepherd ought not, for one scabb'd sheep, to
throw by his tar-boxe; The Pilot ought not for one leake in the poope, to quit
the Helm; Nor the Alderman ought not for one custerd more, at a meal, to give
up his cloak; The Constable ought not to break his staff, and forswear the
watch, for one roaring night; Nor the Piper of the Parish ( Vt paruis componere
magna solebam) to put up his pipes, for one rainy Sunday. These are certain
knocking conclusions; out of which, I am resolved, come what come can, come
beating, come imprisonment, come infamy, come banishment, nay, come the rack,
come the hurdle, (welcome all) I will not discover who I am, till my due time;
and yet still, all shall be, as I said ever, in Justice name, and the King's,
and for the Commonwealth.


WIN. What does he talk to himself, and act so seriously? poor fool!


QVAR. No matter what. Here Is fresher argument, intend that.


ACT. III. SCENE. IIIJ.
COKES. LEATHERHEAD. WASPE. Mistress OVERDOO. WIN-VVIFE. QVARLOVS. TRASH.
GRACE. COme, Mistress Grace, come Sister, here is more fine sights, yet
in faith. Gods 'lid where is Numps?


LEA. What do you lack, Gentlemen? what is it you buy? fine Rattles! Drums?
Babies? little Dogs? and Birds for Ladies? What do you lack?


COK. Good honest Numpes, keep before, I am so afraid thou wilt lose somewhat: my
heart was at my mouth, when I mist thee.


WAS. You were best buy a whip in your hand to drive me.


COK. Nay, do not mistake, Numps, thou art so apt to mistake: I would but
watch the goods. Look you now, the treble fiddle, was even almost like to be
lost.


WAS. Pray you take heed you lose not your self: your best way, were even get
up, and ride for more surety. Buy a tokens worth of great pinnes, to fasten
your self to my shoulder.


LEA. What do you lack, Gentlemen? fine purses, pouches, pincases, pipes?
What is it you lack? a pair o'smithes to wake you in the morning? or a fine
whistling bird?


COK. Numps, here be finer things then any we have bought by odds! and more
delicate horses, a great deal! good Numpes, stay* and come hither.


WAS. Will you scourse with him? you are in Smithfield, you may fit your self
with a fine easy-going street-nag, for your saddle again' Michaelmasse-terme,
do, has he never a little odd cart for you, to make a Carroch on, in the
country, with four pyed hobbyhorses? why the meazills, should you stand
here, with your train, cheaping of Dogs, Birds, and Babies? you have no
children to bestow 'hem on? have you?


COK. No, but again' I have children, Numps, that is all one.


WAS. Do, do, do, do; how many shall you have, think you? an' I were as you,
I Would buy for all my Tenants, too, they are a kind o'ciuill Savages, that will
part with their children for rattles, pipes, and knives. You were best buy a
hatchet, or two, and truck with 'hem.


COK. Good Numps, hold that little tongue o'thine, and save it a labor. I am
resolute Bat, thou know.


WAS. A resolute fool, you are, I know, and a very sufficient Coxcombe; with
all my heart; nay you have it, Sir, and you be angry, turd in your teeth, twice:
(if I said it not once before) and much good do you.


WIN. Was there ever such a selfe-affliction? and so impertinent?


QVAR. Alas! his care will go near to crack him, let us in, and comfort him.


WAS. Would I had been set in the ground, all but the head on me, and had my
brains bowl'd at, or thresh'd out, when first I underwent this plague of a
charge!


QVAR. How now, Numps! almost tired in your Protectorship? ouerparted?
ouerparted?


WAS. Why, I cannot tell, Sir, it may be I am, dos't grieve you?


QVAR. No, I swear dos't not, Numps: to satisfy you.


WAS. Numps? S'blood, you are fine and familiar! how long have we bin
acquainted, I pray you?


QVAR. I think it may be remembered, Numps, that? 'twas since morning sure.


WAS. Why, I hope I know it well enough, Sir, I did not ask to be told.


QVAR. No? why then?


WAS. It Is no matter why, you see with your eyes, now, what I said to you to
day? you will believe me another time?


QVAR. Are you removing the Fair, Numps?


WAS. A pretty question! and a very civil one! yes faith, I have my lading you
see; or shall have anon, you may know whose beast I am, by my burden. If the
pannier-mans Jack were ever better known by his loins of mutton, I Will be
flead, and feed dogs for him, when his time comes.


WIN. How melancholi' Mistress Grace is yonder! pray thee let us go enter our
selves in Grace, with her.


COK, Those six horses, friend I Will have --


WAS. How!


COK. And the three Jews trumps; and half a dozen o'Birds, and that Drum, (I
have one Drum already) and your Smiths; I like that device* o'your smiths,
very pretty well, and four Halberts -- and (le'me see) that fine painted great
Lady, and her three women for state, I Will have.


WAS. No, the shop; buy the whole shop, it will be best, the shop, the shop!


LEA. If his worship please.


WAS. Yes, and keep it during the Fair, Bobchin.


COK. Peace, Numps, friend, do not meddle with him, an' you be wise, and would
show your head above board: he will sting through your wrought nightcap,
believe me. A set of these Violines, I would buy too, for a delicate young
noise I have in the country, that are every one a size less then another, just
like your fiddles. I would feign have a fine young Masque at my marriage, now I
think on it: but I do want such a number o'things. And Numps will not help me
now, and I dare not speak to him.


TRA. Will your worship buy any ginger-bread, very good bread, comfortable
bread?


COK. Ginger-bread! yes, let us see.


WAS. There Is the the other sprindge? He runs to her shop.


LEA. Is this well, goody Ione? to interrupt my market? in the midst? and call
away my customers? can you answer this, at the Piepouldres?


TRA. Why? if his Master-ship have a mind to buy, I hope my ware lies as open
as another's; I may show my ware, as well as you yours.


COK. Hold your peace; I Will content you both: I Will buy up his shop, and thy
basket.


WAS. Will you in faith?


LEA. Why should you put him from it, friend?


WAS. Cry you mercy! you would be sold too, would you? what is the price on you?
Ierkin, and all as you stand? have you any qualities?


TRA. Yes, good man angry-man, you shall find he has qualities, if you cheapen
him.


WAS. Gods so, you have the selling of him! what are they? will they be bought
for love, or money?


TRA. No indeed, Sir.


WAS. For what then? victuals?


TRA. He scorns victuals, Sir, he has bread and butter at home, thanks be to
God! and yet he will do more for a good meal, if the toy take him in the belly,
mary then they must not set him at lower end; if they do, he will go away,
though he fast. But put him a top of the Table, where his place is, and he will
do you forty five things. He has not been sent for, and sought out for
nothing, at your great citty-suppers, to put down Coriat, and Cokeley, and bin
laughed at for his labor; he will play you all the Puppets in the town over, and
the Players, every company, and his own company too; he spares no body!


COK. In Faith?


TRA. He was the first, Sir, that ever baited the fellow in the beare's skin,
an't like your worship: no dog ever came near him, since. And for fine motions!


COK. Is he good at those too? can he set out a Masque trow?


TRA. O Lord, Master! sought to far, and near, for his inventions: and he
engrosses all, he makes all the Puppets in the Fair.


COK. Do thou (in troth) old velvet Ierkin* give me thy hand.


TRA. Nay, Sir, you shall see him in his velvet Ierkin, and a scarf, too, at
night, when you hear him interpret Master Littlewit's Motion.


COK. Speak no more, but shut up shop presently, friend. I Will buy both it, and
thee too, to carry down with me, and he^ hamper, beside. Thy shop shall
furnish out the Masque, and hers the Banquet: I cannot go less, to set out
any thing with credit* what is the price, at a word, o'thy whole shop, case, and
all as it stands?


LEA. Sir, it stands me in six and twenty shillings seven pence, halfe-peny,
besides three shillings for my ground.


COK. Well, thirty shillings will do all, then! And what comes yours too?


TRA. Four shillings, and eleauen pence, Sir, ground, and all, an't like your
worship.


COK. Yes, it does like my worship very well, poor woman, that is five
shillings more, what a Masque shall I furnish out, for forty shillings? (twenty
pound scotsh) and a Banquet of Ginger-bread? there is a stately thing! Numps?
Sister? and my wedding gloves too? (that I never thought on before.) All my
wedding gloves, Ginger-bread? O me! what a device will there be? to make 'hem
eat their fingers ends! and delicate Brooches for the Bride-men! and all! and
then I Will h^' this poesy put to 'hem: For the best grace, meaning Mistress
Grace, my wedding poesy.


GRA. I am beholden to you, Sir, and to your Bartholmew-wit.


WAS. You do not mean this, do you? is this your first purchase?


COK. Yes faith, and I do not think, Numpes, but thou wilt say, it was the
wisest Act, that ever I did in my wardship.


WAS. Like enough! I shall say any thing. I!


ACT. III. SCENE. V.
JUSTICE. EDGVVORTH. NIGHTINGALE. I Cannot beget a Project, with all my
political brain, yet; my Project is how to fetch off this proper young man,
from his debaucht company: I have followed him all the Fair over, and still I
find him with this songster: And I begin shrewdly to suspect their
familiarity; and the young man of a terrible taint, Poetry! with which idle
disease, if he be infected, there is no hope of him, in a state-course. Actum
est, of him for a common-wealths-man: i^ he go to it in Rhyme, once.


EDG. Yonder he is buying o'Ginger-bread: set in quickly, be^fore he part wirh
too much on his money.


NIG. My masters and friends, and good people, draw near, etc.


COK. Ballads! hark, hark! pray thee, fellow, stay a little, He runn's ^^ the
Ballad man. good Numpes, look to the goods. What Ballads have thou? let me
see, let me see my self.


WAS. Why so! he is flowne to another lime-bush, there he will flutter as long
more; till he have never a feather left. Is there a vexation like this,
Gentlemen? will you believe me now, hereafter? shall I have credit with you?


QVAR. Yes faith, shall thou, Numps, and thou art worthy on it, for thou
sweatest for it. I never saw a young Pimpe errant, and his Squire better matched.


WIN-W. Faith, the sister comes after'hem, well, too.


GRA. Nay, if you saw the Justice her husband, my Guardian, you were fitted for
the Mess, he is such a wise one his way --


WIN-W. I wonder, we see him not here.


GRA. O! he is too serious for this place, and yet better sport then then the
other three, I assure you, Gentlemen: where ere he is, though it be of the Bench.


COK. How do thou call it! A caveat against cutpurses! a good jest, in faith,
I would feign see that Demon, your Cutpurse, you talk of, that delicate
handed Devil; He show's his purse boastingly. they say he walks hereabout; I
would see him walk, now. Look you sister, here, here, let him come, sister,
and welcome. Ballad-man, does any cutpurses haunt hereabout? pray thee raise me
one or two* begin and show me one.


NIG. Sir, this is a spell against 'hem, spicke and span new; and it is made as
'twere in mine own person, and I sing it in mine own defense. But 'twill cost
a penny alone, if you buy it.


COK. No matter for the price, thou do not know me, I see, I am an odd
Bartholmew.


OVE. Have a fine picture, Brother?


COK. O Sister, do you remember the ballads over the Nursery-chimney at home
of my own pasting up, there be brave pictures. Other manner of pictures, than
these, friend.


WAS. Yet these will serve to pick the pictures out of your pockets, you shall
see.


COK. So, I heard 'hem say. Pray thee mind him not, fellow: he will have an oar
in every thing.


NIG. It was intended Sir, as if a purse should chance to be cut in my
presence, now, I may be blameless, though: as by the sequel, will more
plainly appear.


COK. We shall find that in the matter. Pray thee begin.


NIG. To the tune of Paggingtons Pound, Sir.


COK. Fa, la la la, la la la, fa la la la. Nay, I Will put thee in tune, and all!
mine own country dance! Pray thee begin.


NIG. It is a gentle admonition, you must know, Sir, both to the purse-cutter,
and the purse-bearer.


COK. Not a word more, out of the tune, an' thou love me: Fa, la la la, la la
la, fa la la la. Come, when?


NIG. My masters and friends, and good people draw near,
And look to your purses, for that I do say;

COK. Ha, ha, this chimes! good counsel at first dash.


NIG. And though little money, in them you do bear.
It cost more to get, then to lose in a day.

COK. Good!


You often have been told,
Both the young and the old;
And bidden beware of the cutpurse so bold:

COK. Well said! he were to blame that would not in faith.


Then if you take heed not, free me from the curse,
Who both give you warning, for and, the cutpurse.
Youth, youth, thou had better bin starved by thy Nurse,
Then live to be hanged for cutting a purse.

COK. Good in faith, how say you, Numps? Is there any harm i'this?


NIG. It has bin vpbrayded to men of my trade,
That often times we are the cause of this crime.

COK. The more coxco^bes they that did it, I wusse.


Alack and for pity, why should it be said?
As if they regarded or places, or time.
Examples have been
Of some that were seen,
In Westminster Hall, yea the pleaders between,
Then why should the Judges be free from this curse,
More then my poor self, for cutting the purse?

COK. God a mercy for that! why should they be more free indeed?


Youth, youth, thou had better bin starved by the Nurse,
Then live to be hanged for cutting a purse.

COK. That again, good Ballad-man, that again. O rare! I would feign rub
mine elbow now, but I dare not pull out my hand. On, I pray thee, he that made
this ballad, shall be Poet to my Masque. He sings the burden with him.


NIG. At Worc'ter it is known well, and even in the Iayle,
A Knight of good worship did there show his face,
Against the foul sinners, in zeal for to rail,
And lost (ipso facto) his purse in the place.

COK. Is it possible?


Nay, once from the Seat
Of Judgment so great,
A Judge there did lose a fair pouch of veluete.

COK. In Faith?


O Lord for thy mercy, how wicked or worse,
Are those that so venture their necks for a purse! Youth, youth, etc.

COK. Youth, youth, etc? pray thee stay a little, friend, yet o'thy conscience,
Numps, speak, is there any harm i'this?


WAS. To tell you true, it is too good for you, less you had grace to follow it.


IVS. It does discover enormitie, I Will mark it more: I have not liked a paltry
piece of poetry, so well a good while.


COK. Youth, youth, etc! where is this youth, now? A man must call upon him, for
his own good, and yet he will not appear: look here, here is for him,
handy-dandy, He shows his purse. which hand will he have? On, I pray there,
with the rest, I do hear of him, but I cannot see him, this Master Youth, the
cutpurse.


NIG. At Plays and at Sermons, and at the Sessions,
It Is daily their practice such booty to make:
Yea, under the Gallows, at Executions,
They stick not the Stare-abouts purses to take.
Nay one without-grace,
at a better place,

COK. That was a fine fellow! I would have him, now.


At Court, and in Christmas, before the Kings face,
Alack then for pity must I bear the curse,
That only belongs to the cunning cutpurse?

COK. But where is their cunning, now, when they should use it? they are all
chained now, I warrant you. Youth, youth, thou had better, etc. The
Rat-catchers charm, are all fools and Asses to this! A pox on 'hem, that
they will not come! that a man should have such a desire to a thing, and want
it.


QVAR. Before God, I Would give half the Fair, and 'twere mine, for a cutpurse
for him, to save his longing.


COK. Look you Sister, here, here, where is it now? He shows his purse
again. which pocket is it in? for a wager?


WAS. I beseech you leave your wagers, and let him end his matter, an't may be.


COK. O, are you aedified Numps?


IVS. Indeed he does interrupt him, too much: There Numps spoke to purpose.


COK. again. Sister, I am an Ass, I cannot keep my purse: on, on; I pray
thee, friend.


NIG. But O, you vile nation of cutpurses all,
Relent and repent, and amend and be sound,
Edgworth gets up to him, and tickles him in the care with a straw twice to
draw his hand out of his pocket. And know that you ought not, by honest men's
fall,
Advance your own fortunes, to die above ground,
And though you go gay,
In silks as you may,
It is not the high way to heaven, (as they say)
Repent then, repent you, for better, for worse:
And kiss not the Gallows for cutting a purse.
Youth, youth, thou had better bin steru'd by thy Nurse,
Then live to be hanged for cutting a purse.

WINW. Will you see sport? look, there is a fellow gathers up to him, mark.


QVA. Good, 'i faith^ o he has lighted on the wrong pocket. WINW. He has it,
before God he is a brave fellow; pity he should be detected.


ALL An excellent ballad! an excellent ballad!


EDG. Friend, let me have the first, let me have the first, I pray you.


COK. Pardon me, Sir. First come, first served; and I Will buy the whole bundle
too.


WIN. That conueyance was better then all, did you see it? he has given the
purse to the ballad-singer.


QVAR. Has he?


EDG. Sir, I cry you mercy; I Will not hinder the poor man's profit: pray you
mistake me not.


COK. Sir, I take you for an honest Gentleman; if that be mistaking, I met you
to day before: ha! humh! O God! my purse is gone, my purse, my purse, etc.


WAS. Come, do not make a stir, and cry your self an Ass, through the Fair
before your time.


COK. Why, have thou it, Numpes? good Numpes, how came you by it? I mar'le!


WAS. I pray you seek some other gamster, to play the fool with: you may lose
it time enough, for all your Fayre-wit.


COK. By this good hand, glove and all, I have lost it already, if thou have it
not: feel else, and Mistress Grace's handkercher, too, out of the the other pocket.


WAS. Why, it is well; very well, exceeding pretty, and well.


EDG. Are you sure you have lost it, Sir?


COK. O God! yes; as I am an honest man, I had it but even now, at youth, youth.


NIG. I hope you suspect not me, Sir.


EDG. Thee? that were a jest indeed! Do thou think the Gentleman is
foolish? where had thou hands, I pray thee? Away Ass, away.


IVS. I shall be beaten again, if I be spied.


EDG. Sir, I suspect an odd fellow, yonder, is stealing away.


OVE. Brother, it is the preaching fellow! you shall suspect him. He was at
your the other purse, you know! Nay, stay, Sir, and view the work you ha'done,
an'you be benefie'd at the Gallows, and preach there, thank your own
handy-worke.


COK. Sir, you shall take no pride in your preferment: you shall be silenced
quickly.


IVS. What do you mean? sweet buds of gentility.


COK. To have my peneworths out on you: Bud. No less then two purses a day,
serve you? I thought you a simple fellow, when my man Numpes beat you, in the
morning, and pitied you --


OVE. So did I, I Will besworne, brother; but now I see he is a lewd, and
pernicious Enormity: (as Master Ouerdoo calls him.)


IVS. Mine own words turned upon me, like swords.


COK. Cannot a man's purse be at quiet for you, in the Masters pocket, but you
must entice it forth, and debauch it?


WAS. Sir, Sir, keep your debauch, and your fine Bartholmew-termes to your
self; and make as much on'hem as you please. But gi'me this from you, in the
mean time: I beseech you, see if I can look to this. Wasp takes the License
from him.


COK. Why, Numps?


WAS. Why? because you are an Ass, Sir, there is a reason the shortest way, and
you will needs have it; now you ha'got the trick of losing, you would lose your
breech, an't 'twere loose. I know you, Sir, come, deliver, you will go and
crack the vermin, you breed now, will you? it is very fine, will you have the
truth on it? they are such retchlesse flies as you are, that blow cutpurses
abroad in every corner; your foolish having of money, makes 'hem. An' there
were no wiser then I, Sir, the trade should lie open for you, Sir, it should
in faith, Sir. I would teach your wit to come to your head, Sir, as well as your
land to come into your hand, I assure you, Sir.


WIN. Alack, good Numps.


WAS. Nay, Gentlemen, never pity me, I am not worth it: Lord send me at home
once, to Harrow of the Hill again, if I travel any more, call me Coriat;
withal my heart.


QVAR. Stay, Sir, I must have a word with you in private. Do you hear?


EDG. With me, Sir? what is your pleasure? good Sir.


QVAR. Do not deny it. You are a cutpurse, Sir, this Gentleman here, and I,
saw you, nor do we mean to detect you (though we can sufficiently inform our
selves, toward the danger of concealing you) but you must do us a piece of
service.


EDG. Good Gentlemen, do not undo me; I am a civil young man, and but a
beginner, indeed.


QVAR. Sir, your beginning shall bring on your ending, for us. We are no
Catchpoles nor Constables. That you are to undertake, is this; you saw the old
fellow, with the bl^cke box, here?


EDG. The little old Governor, Sir?


QVAR. That same: I see, you have flowne him to a mark already. I would ha'you
get away that box from him, and bring it us.


EDG. Would you have the box and all, Sir? or only that, that is in it? I Will
get you that, and leave him the box, to play with still: (which will be the
harder of the two) because I would gain your worships good opinion of me.


WIN-W. He says well, it is the greater Mastry, and 'twill make the more sport
when it is mist.


EDG. I, and 'twill be the longer a missing, to draw on the sport.


QVAR. But look you do it now, sirrah, and keep your word: or --


EDG. Sir, if ever I break my word, with a Gentleman, may I never read word at
my need. Where shall I find you?


QVAR. Some-where in the Fair, heereabouts. Dispatch it quickly. I would feign
see the careful fool deluded! of all Beasts, I love the serious Ass. He that
takes pains to be one, and plays the fool, with the greatest diligence that
can be.


GRA. Then you would not chose, Sir, but love my Guardian, Justice Ouerdo^, who
is answerable to that description, in every hair of him.


QVAR. So I have heard. But how came you, Mistis Welborne, to be his Ward? or
have relation to him, at first?


GRA. Faith, through a common calamity, he bought me, Sir; and now he will
marry me to his wives brother, this wise Gentleman, that you see, or else I
must pay value of my land


QVAR. S'lid, is there no device of disparagement? or so? talk with some
crafty fellow, some picklocke of the Law! Would I had studied a year longer
in the Innes of Court, and't had been but in your case.


WIN-W. I Master Quarlous, are you proffering?


GRA. You Would bring but little aid, Sir.


WIN-W. (I Will look to you 'ifaith, Gamster.) An unfortunate foolish Tribe you
are fallen into, Lady, I wonder you can endure 'hem.


GRA. Sir, they that cannot work their fetters off; must wear 'hem.


WINW. You see what care they have on you, to leave you thus.


GRA. Faith the same they have of themselves, Sir. I cannot greatly complain,
if this were all the plea I had against 'hem.


WIN. It Is true! but will you please to withdraw with us, a little, and make
them think, they have lost you. I hope our manners have been such hitherto,
and our language, as will give you no cause, to doubt your self, in our
company.


GRA. Sir, I will give my self, no cause; I am so secure of mine own manners,
as I suspect not yours.


QVAR. Look where John Little-wit comes.


WIN-W. Away, I Will not be seen, by him.


QVAR. No, you were not best, hee'ld tell his mother, the widow.


WIN W. Heatt, what do you mean?


QVAR. Cry you mercy, is the wind there? must not the widow be named?


ACT. III SCENE. VI.
JOHN. WIN. TRASH. LEATHERHEAD. KNOCKHVM. BVSY. PVRE CRAFT. Do you hear Win,
Win?


WIN. What say you, John?


IOH. While they are paying the reckoning, Win, I Will tell you a thing Win, we
shall never see any sights in the Fair, Win, except you long still, Win, good
Win, sweet Win, long to see some Hobby-horses, and some Drums, and Rattles,
and Dogs, and fine devices, Win. The Bull with the five legs, Win; and the
great Hog: now you have begun with Pigge, you may long for any thing, Win, and
so for my Motion, Win.


WIN. But we shall not eat of the Bull, and the Hog, John, how shall I long then?


IOH. O yes! Win: you may long to see, as well as to taste, Win: how did the
Pothecarie's wife, Win, that longed to see the Anatomy, Win? or the Lady, Win,
that desired to spit in the great Lawyers mouth, after an eloquent pleading? I
assure you they longed, VVin, good Win, go in, and long.


TRA. I think we are rid of our new customer, brother Leather-head, we shall
hear no more of him. They plot to be gone.


LEA. All the better, let us pack up all, and be gone, before he find us


TRA. Stay a little, yonder comes a company: it may be we may take some more
money.


KNO, Sir, I will take your counsel, and cut my hair, and leave vapors: I
see, that Tobacco, and Bottle-Ale, and Pig, and Whit, and very Vrsla, her
self, is all vanity.


BVS. Only Pigge was not comprehended in my admonition, the rest were. For
long hair, it is an Ensign of pride, a banner, and the world is full of those
banners, very full of Banners. And, bottle-ale is a drink of Sathan's, a
diet-drinke of Satan's, devised to puff us up, and make us swell in this
latter age of vanity, as the smoke of tobacco, to keep us in mist and error:
But the fleshly woman, (which you call Vrsla) is above all to be avoided,
having the marks upon her, of the three enemies of Man, the World, as being in
the Fair; the Devil, as being in the fire; and and the Flesh, as being her
self.


PVR. Brother Zeale-of-the land! what shall we do? my daughter Win-the-fight,
is fallen into her fit of longing again.


BVS. For more pig? there is no more, is there?


PVR. To see some sights, in the Fair.


BVS. Sister, let her fly the impurity of the place, swiftly, lest she partake
of the pitch thereof. Thou art the seat of the Beast, O Smithfield, and I will
leave thee. Idolatry peepeth out on every side of thee.


KNO. An excellent right Hypocrite! now his belly is full, he falls a railing
and kicking, the Jade. A very good vapor! I Will in, and joy Vrsla, with
telling, how her pigge works, two and a half he eat to his share. And he has
drunk a pailefull. He eats with his eyes, as well as his teeth.


LEA. What do you lack, Gentlemen? What is it you buy? Rattles, Drumms, Babies.
--


BVS. Peace, with thy Apocryphal wares, thou profane Publican: thy Bells, thy
Dragons, and thy Tobie's Dogs. Thy Hobbyhorse is an Idol, a very Idol, a
feirce and rank Idol: And thou, the Nabuchadnezzar, the proud Nabuchadnezzar
of the Fair, that set'st it up, for children to fall down to, and worship.


LEA. Cry you mercy, Sir, will you buy a fiddle to fill up your noise.


IOH. Look Win. do, look a Gods name, and save your longing. Here be fine
sights.


PVR. I child, so you hate 'hem, as our Brother Zeal does, you may look on
'hem.


LEA. Or what do you say, to a Drum. Sir?


BVS. It is the broken belly of the Beast, and thy Bellows there are his
lungs, and these Pipes are his throat, those Feathers are of his tail, and
thy Rattles, the gnashing of his teeth.


TRA. And what is my ginger-bread? I pray you.


BVS. The prouander that pricks him up. Hence with thy basket of Popery, thy
nest of Images: and whole legend of ginger-worke.


LEA. Sir if you be not quiet, the quicklier, I Will ha'you clapped fairly by
the heels, for disturbing the Fair.


BVS. The sin of the Fair prouokes me, I cannot be silent.


PVR. Good brother Zeal!


LEA. Sir, I Will make you silent, believe it.


IOH. Il'd give a shilling, you could in faith, friend.


LEA. Sir, give me your shilling, I Will give you my shop, if I do not, and I Will
leave it in pawn with you, in the mean time.


IOH. A match in faith, but do it quickly, then.


BVS. Hinder me not, woman. I was moved in spirit, He speaks to the widow. to
be here, this day, in this Fair, this wicked, and foul Fair; and fitter may
it be a called a foul, then a Fair: To protest against the abuses of it, the
foul abuses of it, in regard of the afflicted Saints, that are troubled, very
much troubled, exceedingly troubled, with the opening of the merchandise of
Babylon again, and the peeping of Popery upon the stals, here, here, in the
high places. See you not Goldylocks, the purple strumpet, there? in her yellow
gown, and green sleeves? the profane pipes, the tinckling timbrells? A shop
of relics!


IOH. Pray you forbear, I am put in trust with 'hem.


BVS. And this Idolatrous Grove of Images, this flasket of Idols! Ouerthrows
the ginger-bread. which I will pull down --

(TRA. O my ware, my ware, God bless it.)


BVS. In my zeal, and glory to be thus exercised.


LEA. Here he is, pray you lay hold on his zeal, we cannot sell a whistle,
for him, in tune. Stop his noise, first!


BVS. Thou can not: it is a sanctified noise. Leather-head enters with
officers I will make a loud and most strong noise, till I have daunted the
profane enemy. And for this cause. --


LEA. Sir, here is no man afraid of you, or your cause. You shall swear it,
in the stocks, Sir.


BVS. I will thrust my self into the stocks, upon the pikes of the Land.


LEA. Carry him away.


PVR. What do you mean, wicked men?


BVS. Let them alone; I fear them not.


IOH. Was not this shilling well ventured, Win? for our liberty? Now we may go
play, and see over the Fair, where we list our selves; my mother is gone after
him, and let her even go, and loose us.


WIN. Yes John, but I know not what to do.


IOH. For what, Win?


WIN. For a thing, I am ashamed to tell you, in faith, and it is too far to go
home.


IOH. I pray thee be not ashamed, VVin. Come, in faith thou shall not be
ashamed, is it any thing about the Hobby-horse-man? an't be, speak freely.


WIN. Hang him, base Bobchin, I scorn him; no, I have very great, what sha'
call'um, John.


IOH. o! Is that all, Win? we will go back to Captain Jordan; to the
pig-womans, Win. he will help us, or she with a dripping pan, or an old kettle,
or something. The poor greasy soul loves you, Win, and after we'll visit the
Fair all over, Win, and, see my Puppet play, Win, you know it is a fine matter,
Win.


LEA. Let Us away, I counseled you to pack up before, Ione.


TRA. A pox of his Bedlem purity. He has spoiled half my ware: but the best
is, we lose nothing, if we miss our first Merchant.


LEA. It shall be hard for him to find, or know us, when we are translated,
Ione.


ACT. IIII. SCENE. I.
TROVBLE-ALL. BRISTLE. HAGGISE, COKES. JUSTICE. POCHER, BVSY. PVRECRAFT. MY
Masters, I do make no doubt, but you are officers.


BRI. What then, Sir?


TRO. And the Kings loving, and obedient subjects.


BRI. Obedient, friend? take heed what you speak, I advise you: Oliver
Bristle aduises you. His loving subjects, we grant you: but not his obedient,
at this time, by your leave, we know our selves, a little better then so, we
are to command, Sr. and such as you are to be obedient. Here Is one of his
obedient subjects, going to the stocks, and we will make you such another, if
you talk.


TRO. You are all wise enough in your places, I know.


BRI. If you know it, Sir, why do you bring it in question?


TRO. I question nothing, pardon me. I do only hope you have warrant, for what
you do, and so, quit you, and so, multiply you.


HAG. He goes away again. What Is he? bring him up to the stocks there. Why
bring you him not up?


TRO. If you have Justice Ouerdoo's warrant, it is well: comes again. you are
safe; that is the warrant of warrants. I Will not give this button, for any man's
warrant else.


BRI. Like enough, Sir, but let me tell you, an' you play away your buttons,
thus, you will want 'hem ere night, goes away. for any store I see about you:
you might keep 'hem, and save pinnes, I wusse.


IVS. What should he be, that does so esteem, and advance my warrant? he
seems a sober and discreet person! it is a comfort to a good conscience, to be
followed with a good fame, in his sufferings. The world will have a pretty taste
by this, how I can bear adversity: and it will beget a kind of reverence,
toward me, hereafter, even from mine enemies, when they shall see I carry my
calamity nobly, and that it does neither break me, nor bend me.


HAG. Come, Sir, here is a place for you to preach in. They put him in the
stocks. Will you put in your leg?


IVS. That I will, cheerfully.


BRI. Of My conscience a Seminary! he kisses the stocks.


COK. Well my Masters, I Will leave him with you; now I see him bestowed, I Will
go look for my goods, and Numps.


HAG. You may, Sir, I warrant you; where is the the other Bawler? fetch him too,
you shall find 'hem both fast enough.


IVS. In the midst of this tumult, I will yet be the Author of mine own rest,
and not minding their fury, sit in the stocks, in that calm, as shall be able
to trouble a Triumph.


TRO. Do you assure me upon your words? comes again, may I undertake for you,
if I be asked the question; that you have this warrant?


HAG. What Is this fellow, for Gods sake?


TRO. Do but show me Adam Ouerdoo, and I am satisfied* goes out.


BRI. He is a fellow that is distracted, they say; one Trouble-all* he was an
officer in the Court of Pie-poulders, here last year, and put out on his place
by Justice Ouerdoo.


IVS. Ha!


BRI. Upon which, he took an idle conceit, and's run mad upon it. So that
ever since, he will do nothing, but by Justice Ouerdoo's warrant, he will not
eat a crust, nor drink a little, nor make him in his apparel, ready. His
wife, Sirreuerence, cannot get him make his water, or shift his shirt, without
his warrant.


IVS. If this be true, this is my greatest disaster! how am I bound to satisfy
this poor man, that is of so good a nature to me, out of his wits! where
there is no room left for dissembling. comes in.


TRO. If you cannot show me Adam Ouerdoo, I am in doubt of you: I am afraid you
cannot answer it.


HAG. Before me, goes again. Neighbor Bristle (and now I think on it better)
Justice Ouerdoo, is a very parantory person.


BRI. O! are you advised of that? and a severe Iusticer, by your leave.


IVS. Do I hear ill o'that side, too?


BRI. He will sit as upright of the bench, an' you mark him, as a candle in the
socket, and give light to the whole Court in every business.


HAG. But he will burn blew, and swell like a bile (God bless us) an' he be
angry.


BRI.. I, and he will be angry too, when his list, that is more: and when he
is angry, be it right or wrong; he has the Law on's side, ever. I mark that
too.


IVS. I will be more tender hereafter. I see compassion may become a Justice,
though it be a weakness, I confess; and nearer a vice, then a virtue.


HAG. They take the Justice out. Well, take him out of the stocks again,
we will go a sure way to work, we will have the Ace of hearts of our side, if we
can.


POC. Come, bring him away to his fellow, there. Master Busy, we shall rule
your legs, I hope, though we cannot rule your tongue.


BVS. No, Minister of darkness, no, thou can not rule my tongue, my tongue
it is mine own; and with it I will both kn^^ke^ and mock down your Bartholmew
abhominat^^ns, till you (...) made a hissing to the neighbor Parishes, round
about.


HAG. Let him alone, we have devised better upon it.


PVR. And shall he not into the stocks then?


BRI. No, Mistress, we will have 'hem both to Justice Ouerdoo, and let him do
over 'hem as is fitting. Then I, and my gossip Haggis, and my beadle Pocher are
discharged.


PVR. O, I thank you, blessed, honest men!


BRI. Nay, never thank us, but thank this madman that comes here, he put it
in our heads.


PVR. Is he mad? Now heaven increase his madness, and bless it, Comes
again. and thank it, Sir, your poor hand-maide thanks you.


TRO. Have you a warrant? an' you have a warrant, show it.


PVR. Yes, I have a warrant out of the word, to give thanks for removing any
scorn intended to the brethren.


TRO. It is Justice Ouerdoo's warrant, that I look for, if you have not that,
keep your word, I Will keep mine. Quit ye, and multiply ye.


ACT. IIII. SCENE. II.
EDGVVORTH. TROVBLE-ALL. NIGHTINGALE. COKES. COSTARDMONGER. COme away
Nightingale, I pray thee.


TRO. Whither go you? where is your warrant?


EDG. Warrant, for what, Sir?


TRO. For what you go about, you know how fit it is, an' you have no warrant,
bless you, I Will pray for you, Goes out. that is all I can do.


EDG. What means he?


NIG. A madman that haunts the Fair, do you not know him? it is marvel he
has not more followers, after his ragged heels.


EDG. Beshrew him, he startled me: I thought he had known of our plot. Guilt's
a terrible thing! have you prepared the Costardmonger?


NIG. Yes, and agreed for his basket of pears; he is at the corner here,
ready. And your Prise, he comes down, sailing, that way, all alone; without
his Protector: he is rid of him, it seems.


EDG. I, I know; I should have followed his Protector-ship for a feat I am to
do upon him: But this offered it self, so in the way, I could not let it
escape: here he comes, whistle, Nightingale whistles be this sport called
Dorring the Dottrell.


NIG. Wh, wh, wh, wh, etc.


COK. By this light, I cannot find my ginger-bread-Wife, nor my
Hobby-horse-man in all the Fair, now; to have my money again. And I do not
know the way out on it, to go home for more, do you hear, friend, you that
whistle; what tune is that, you whistle?


NIG. A new tune, I am practicing, Sir.


COK. Do thou know where I dwell, I pray thee? nay, on with thy tune, I have
no such have, for an answer: I Will practice with thee. Nightingale sets his
foot before him, and he falls with his basket.


COS. Buy any pears, very fine pears, pears fine.


COK. Gods so! a musse, a musse, a musse, a musse.


COS. Good Gentleman, my ware, my ware, I am a poor man. Good Sir, my ware.


NIG. Cokes falls a scrambling whilst they run away with his things. Let me
hold your sword, Sir, it troubles you.


COK. Do, and my cloak, an'thou wilt; and my hat, too.


EDG. A delicate great boy! me thinks, he out-scrambles 'hem all. I cannot
persuade my self, but he goes to grammer-schole yet; and plays the trewant,
to day.


NIG. Would he had another purse to cut, Zekiel.


EDG. Purse? a man might cut out his kidneys, I think; and he never feel
'hem, he is so earnest at the sport.


NIG. His soul is half way out on's body, at the game.


EDG. Away, Nightingale: that way.


COK. I think I am furnished for Catherne pears, for one vnder-meale: gi'me
my cloak.


COS. Good Gentleman, give me my ware.


COK. Where Is the fellow, I ga' my cloak to? my cloak? and my hat? He runs
out. ha! Gods'lid, is he gone? thieues, thieues, help me to cry, Gentlemen.


EDG. Away, Costermonger, come to us to Vrsla's. Talk of him to have a soul?
'heart, if he have any more then a thing given him in stead of salt, only to
keep him from stinking, I Will be hanged before my time, presently, where should
it be trow? in his blood; he has not so much to'ard it in his whole body, as
will maintain a good Flea; And if he take this course, he will not have so
much land left, as to rear a Calfe within this twelve month. Was there ever
green Plouer so pulled! That his little Ouerseer had been here now, and
been but tall enough, to see him steal pears, in exchange, for his
beauer-hat, and his cloak thus? I must go find him out, next, for his black
box, and his Patent (it seems) he has of his place; which I think the
Gentleman would have a reuersion of; that spoke to me for it so earnestly.


COK. He comes again. Would I might lose my doublet, and hose, too; as I am an
honest man, and never stir, if I think there be any thing, but thieuing, and
cooz'ning, i'this whole Fair* Bartholmew-fayre, quoth he; an' ever any
Bartholmew had that luck in it, that I have had, I Will be martyred for him,
throws away his pears. and in Smithfield, too. I have paid for my pears, a rot
on 'hem, I Will keep 'hem no longer; you were choake-peares to me; I had bin
better ha'gone to mum chance for you, I wusse. Me thinks the Fair should not
have used me thus, and 'twere but for my names sake, I would not have used a dog
of the name, so. O, Numps will triumph, now! Friend, do you know who I am? or
where I lie? I do not my self, I Will besworne. Do but carry me home, and I Will
please thee, I have money enough there, I have lost my self, and my cloak and
my hat; and my fine sword, and my sister, and Numps, and Mistress Grace, (a
Gentlewoman that I should have married) and a cut-worke handkercher, she ga'
me, and two purses to day. And my bargain o'Hobby-horses and Ginger-bread,
which grieves me worst of all.


TRO. Trouble-all comes again. By whose warrant, Sir, have you done all this?


COK. Warrant? thou art a wise fellow, indeed, as if a man need a warrant to
lose any thing, with.


TRO. Yes, Justice Ouerdo's warrant, a man may get, and lose with, I Will stand
to it.


COK. Justice Ouerdoo? Do thou know him? I lie there, he is my brother in
Law, he married my sister: pray thee show me the way, do thou know the house?


TRO. Sir, show me your warrant, I know nothing without a warrant, pardon me.


COK. Why, I warrant thee, come along: thou shall see, I have wrought pillowes
there, and cambricke sheets, and sweet bags, too. Pray thee guide me to the
house.


TRO. Sir, I Will tell you; go you thither your self, first, alone; tell your
worshipful brother your mind: and but bring me three lines of his hand, or
his Clerks, with Adam Ouerdoo, underneath; here I Will stay you, I Will obey you,
and I Will guide you presently.


COK. S'lid, this is an Ass, I have found him, pox upon me, what do I
talking to such a dull fool; farewell, you are a very Coxcomb, do you hear?


TRO. I think, I am, if Justice Ouerdoo sign to it, I am, and so we are all,
he will quit us all, multiply us all.


ACT. IIII.
SCENE. IIJ.
GRACE. QVARLOVS. WIN-WIFE. They enter with their swords drawn. TROVBLE-ALL.
EDGVVORTH. GEntlemen, this is no way that you take: you do but breed one
another trouble, and offense, and give me no contentment at all. I am no she,
that affects to be quarell'd for, or have my name or fortune made the question
of men's swords.

QVA. S'lood, we love you.


GRA. If you both love me, as you pretend, your own reason will tell you, but
one can enjoy me; and to that point, there leads a directer line, then by my
infamy, which must follow, if you fight. It Is true, I have professed it to you
ingenuously, that rather then to be yoked with this Bridegroom is appointed
me, I would take up any husband, almost upon any trust. Though Subtilty would
say to me, (I know) he is a fool, and has an estate, and I might govern him,
and enjoy a friend, beside. But these are not my aims, I must have a husband I
must love, or I cannot live with him. I shall ill make one of these politic
wives!


WIN-W. Why, if you can like either of us, Lady, say, which is he, and the
other shall swear instantly to desist.


QVA. Content, I accord to that willingly.


GRA. Sure you think me a woman of an extreme leuity, Gentlemen, or a strange
fancy, that (meeting you by chance in such a place, as this, both at one
instant, and not yet of two hours acquaintance, neither of you deserving before
the other, of me) I should so forsake my modesty (though I might affect one
more particularly) as to say, This is he, and name him.


QVA. Why, wherefore should you not? What should hinder you?


GRA. If you would not give it to my modesty, allow it yet to my wit; give me
so much of woman, and cunning, as not to betray my self impertinently. How can
I judge of you, so far as to a choice, without knowing you more? you are both
equal, and alike to me, yet: and so indifferently affected by me, as each of
you might be the man, if the other were away. For you are reasonable creatures,
you have understanding, and discourse. And if fate send me an understanding
husband, I have no fear at all, but mine own manners shall make him a good
one.


QVAR. Would I were put forth to making for you, then.


GRA. It may be you are, you know not what is toward you: will you consent to a
motion of mine, Gentlemen?


WINW. What ever it be, we'll presume reasonableness, coming from you.


QVAR. And fitness, too.


GRA. I saw one of you buy a pair of tables, even now.


WIN-W. Yes, here they be, and maiden ones too, unwritten in.


GRA. The fitter for what they may be employed in. You shall write either of
you, here, a word, or a name, what you like best; but of two, or three
syllables at most: and the next person that comes this way (because Destiny has
a high hand in business of this nature) I Will demand, which of the two words,
he, or she does approve; and according to that sentence, fix my resolution,
and affection, without change.


QVAR. Agreed, my word is conceived already.


WIN-W. And mine shall not be long creating after.


GRA. But you shall promise, Gentlemen, not to be curious to know, which of you
it is, taken; but give me leave to conceal that till you have brought me,
either home, or where I may safely tender my self.


WIN-W Why that is but equal.


QVAR. We are pleased.


GRA. Because I will bind both your endeavors to work together, friendly, and
jointly, each to the others fortune, and have my self fitted with some means,
to make him that is forsaken, a part of amends.


QVAR. These conditions are very courteous. Well my word is out of the Arcadia,
then: Argalus.


WIN-W. And mine out of the play, Palemon.


TRO. Have you any warrant for this, Gentlemen? Trouble-all comes again.


QVAR. WIN-W. Ha!


TRO. There must be a warrant had, believe it.


WIN-W. For what?


TRO. Fot whatsoever it is, any thing indeed, no matter what.


QVA. S'light, here is a fine ragged Prophet, dropped down 'ithe nicke!


TRO. Heaven quit you, Gentlemen.


QVA. Nay, stay a little, good Lady, put him to the question.


GRA. You are content, then?


WIN-W. QVAR. Yes yes.


GRA. Sir, here are two names written --


TRO. Is Iudice Ouerdoo, one?


GRA. How, Sir? I pray you read 'hem to your self, it is for a wager between
these Gentlemen, and with a stroke or any difference, mark which you approve
best.


TRO. They may be both worshipful names for ought I know, Mistress, but Adam
Ouerdoo had been worth three of 'hem, I assure you, in this place, that is in
plain english.


GRA. This man amazes me! I pray you, like one of 'hem, Sir.


TRO. I do like him there, that has the best warrant, Mistress, to save your
longing, and (multiply him) It may be this. But I am I still for Justice
Ouerdoo, that is my conscience. And quit you.


WIN-W. Is It done, Lady?


GRA. I, and strangely, as ever I saw! What fellow is this trow?


QVA. No matter what, a Fortune Tellers we have made him. Which is it, which is it.


GRA. Nay, did you not promise, not to enquire?


QVA. S'lid, I forgot that, pray you pardon me. Look, here is our Mercury
come: The License arriues in the finest time, too! it is but scraping out Cokes
his name, and it is done.


WIN-W. How now lime-twig? have thou touched.


EDG. Not yet, Sir, except you would go with me, and see it, it is not worth
speaking on. The act is nothing, without a witness. Yonder he is, your man
with the box fallen into the finest company, and so transported with vapors,
they have got in a Northren Clothier, and one Puppy, a Western man, that is come
to wrestle before my Lord Mayor, anon, and Captain Whit, and one Val Cutting,
that helps Captain Jordan to roar, a circling boy: with whom your Numps, is
so taken, that you may strip him of his clothes, if you will. I Will undertake
to geld him for you; if you had but a Surgeon, ready, to fear him. And
Mistress Justice, there, is the goodest woman! she does so love 'hem all
over, in terms of Justice, and the Style of authority, with her hood upright
-- that I beseech you come away Gentlemen, and see it.


QVAR. S'light, I would not lose it for the Fair, what'll you do, Ned?


WIN-W. Why, stay here about for you, Mistress Welborne must not be seen.


QVA. Do so, and find out a Priest in the mean time, I Will bring the License.
Lead, which way is it?


EDG. Here, Sir, you are of the backeside of the Booth already, you may hear the
noise.

WHI. I tinke I be, he musht not like it, indeed.


CVT. Nay, then he both must, and will like it, Sir, for all you.


KNO. If he have reason, he may like it, Sir.


WHI. By no meansh Captain, upon reason, he may like nothing upon reason.

KNO. Nay, never question him, for he is in the right.


WHI. Yesh, I am i would right, I confesh it, so ish de little man too.


WAS. I Will have nothing confessed, that concerns me. I am not in the right, nor

mind,


CVT. Mind? why, here is no man minds you, Sir, They drink again. nor any

EDG. You shall see, Sir.


NOR. I Will ne maire, my waimb warkes too mickle with this anready.


EDG. Will you take that, Master Waspe, that no body should mind you?

EDG. No, but me thinks you should not be vnminded, though,


WAS. Nor, I wu'not be, now I think on it, do you hear, new acquaintance,

CVT. Why, then you may choose.


WAS. Why, and I Will choose whether I Will choose or no.


KNO. I think you may, and it is true; and I allow it for a resolute vapor.


WAS. Nay, then, I do think you do not think, and it is no resolute vapor.


CVT. Yes, in some sort he may allow you.


KNO. In no sort, Sir, pardon me, I can allow him nothing. You mistake the
vapor.


WAS. He mistakes nothing, Sir, in no sort.


WHI. Yes, I pre dee now, let him mistake.


WAS. A turd in your teeth, never pre dee me, for I will have nothing mistaken.


KNO. They fall by the cares. Turd, ha turd? a noisome vapor, strike Whit.


OVE. Why, Gentlemen, why Gentlemen, I charge you upon my authority, conserve
the peace. In the Kings name, and my Husbands, put up your weapons, I shall be
driven to commit you my self, else.


QVA. Ha, ha, ha.

WAS. Yes, then he may both laugh, and hope in any sort, an't please him.


QVA. Faith, and I will then, for it does please me exceedingly.


WAS. No exceeding neither, Sir.


KNO. No, that vapor is too lofty.


QVA. Gentlemen, I do not play well at your game of vapors, I am not very
good at it, but --


CVT. Do you hear, Sir? I would speak with you in circle? He draws a
circle on the ground.


QVA. In circle, Sir? what would you with me in circle?


CVT. Can you lend me a Piece, a Iacobus? in circle?


QVA. S'lid, your circle will prove more costly then your vapors, then. Sir,
no, I lend you none.


CVT. Your beard's not well turned up, Sir.


QVA. How Rascal? are you playing with my beard? They draw all, and fight.
I Will break circle with you.

KNO. Gather up, Whit, gather up, Whit, good vapors.


OVE. What mean you? are you Rebels? Gentlemen? shall I send out a Sericant

Rich? am I come to be pitied by your tuft taffata now? why Mistress, I knew
Adam, the Clerk, your husband, when he was Adam Scriuener, and writ for two

are you, Sir? The watch comes in.


BRI. We be men, and no Infidells; what is the matter, here, and the noyses?
can you tell?


WAS. Heart, what have you to do? cannot a man quarrel in quietness? but he
must be put out on it by you? what are you?


BRI. Why, we be his Majesty's Watch, Sir.


WAS. Watch? S'blood, you are a sweet watch, indeed. A body would think, and
you watched well a nights, you should be contented to sleep at this time a
day. Get you to your fleas, and your flocke-beds, you Rogues, your kennells,
and lie down close.


BRI. Down? yes, we will down, I warrant you, down with him in his Majesty's
name, down, down with him, and carry him away, to the pigeon-holes.


OVE. I thank you honest friends, in the behalf of the Crown, and the peace,
and in Master Ouerdoo's name, for suppressing enormities.


WHI. Stay, Bristle, here ish a noder brash o'drunkards, but very quiet,

VRS. Let her sell her hood, and buy a sponge, with a pox to her, my vessel,

Win, I Will be bold to leave you, i'this good company, Win: for half an hour,
or so Win, while I go, and see how my matter goes forward, and if the Puppets
be perfect: and then I Will come and fetch you, Win.


WIN. Will you leave me alone with two men, John?


IOH. I, they are honest Gentlmen Win, Captain Jordan, and Captain Whit,
they will use you very ciuilly, Win, God b'w'you, Win.


VRS. What Is her husband gone?


KNO. On his false, gallop, Vrs, away.


VRS. An' you be right Bartholmew-birds, now show your selves so: we are undone
for want of foul in the Fair, here. Here will be Zekiell Edgworth, and three
or four gallants, with him at night, and I have neither Plouer nor Quail for
'hem: persuade this between you two, to become a Bird of the game, while I
work the velvet woman, within, (as you call her.)


KNO. I conceive thee, Vrs! go thy ways, do thou hear, Whit? is it not
pity, my delicate dark chestnut here; with the fine lean head, large
forehead, round eyes, even mouth, sharp ears, long neck, thin crest,
close withers, plain back, deep sides, short fillets, and full flanks: with
a round belly, a plumpe but tocke, large thighs, knit knees, straight legs,
short pasternes, smooth hoofes, and short heels; should lead a dull honest
woman's life, that might live the life of a Lady?


WHI. Yes, by my fait, and trot, it is, Captain: de honesht woman's life is a
scuruy dull life, indeed, la.

KNO. Brave vapors!


WHI. And lie by twenty on'hem, if dou pleash shweet heart.

WHI. Tish common, shweet heart, tou may do it by my hand: it shall be
justified to ty husbands faish, now: tou shall be as honesht as the skin
between his hornsh, la!


KNO. Yes, and wear a dressing, top, and top-gallant, to compare with ere a
husband on 'hem all, for a fore-top: it is the vapor of spirit in the wife, to
cuckold, now adays; as it is the vapor of fashion, in the husband, not to
suspect. Your prying cat-eyed-citizen, is an abominable vapor.


WIN. Lord, what a fool have I been!


WHI. Mend then, and do every ting like a Lady, hereafter, never know ty
husband, from another man.


KNO. Nor any one man from another, but in the dark.


WHI. I, and then it ish no dishgrash to know any man.


VRS. Help, help here.


KNO. How now? what vapour's there?


VRS. O, you are a sweet Ranger! and look well to your walks. Yonder is your
Punque of Turnbull, Ramping Ales, has fallen upon the poor Gentlewoman within,
and pulled her hood over her ears, Alice eners, beating he Iustice's wife. and
her hair through it.


OVE. Help, help, in the Kings name.


ALE. A mischief on you, they are such as you are, that undo us, and take our
trade from us, with your tuft-taffata hanches.


KNO. How now Alice!


ALE. The poor common whores can have no traffic, for the privy rich ones;
your caps and hoods of velvet, call away our customers, and lick the fat from
us.


VRS. Peace you foul ramping Jade, you --


ALE. Od's foot, you Bawd in grease, are you talking?


KNO. Why, Alice, I say.


ALE. Thou Sow of Smithfield, thou.


VRS. Thou tripe of Turnebull.


KNO. Cat-a-mountaine-vapours! ha!


VRS. You know where you were taw'd lately, both lashed, and slashed you were
in Bridewell.


ALE. I, by the same token, you rid that week, and broake out the bottom
of the Cart, Night-tub.


KNO. Why, Lion face! ha! do you know who I am? shall I tear ruff, slit
wastcoat, make rags of petticoat? ha! go to, vanish, for fear of vapors.
Whit, a kick, Whit, in the parting vapor. Come brave woman, take a good heart,
thou shall be a Lady, too.


WHI. Yes fait, dey shall all both be Ladies, and write Madame. I will do it my
self for them. Do, is the vord, and D is the middle letter of Madame, D D, put
'hem together, and make deeds, without which, all words are alike, la.


KNO. It Is true, Vrsla, take 'hem in, open thy wardrope, and fit 'hem to their
calling. Greene-gownes, Crimson-petticoats, green women! my Lord Majors green
women! guests of the Game, true bred. I Will provide you a Coach, to take the
air, in.


VVIN. But do you think you can get one?


KNO. O, they are as common as wheelebarrowes, where there are great dunghills.
Every Pettifoggers wife, has 'hem, for first he buys a Coach, that he may
marry, and then he marries that he may be made Cuckold in it: For if their
wives ride not to their Cuckolding, they do 'hem no credit. Hide, and be
hidden; ride, and be ridden, says the vapor of experience.


ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. VI.
TROBLE-ALL. KNOCKHVM. WHIT. QVARLOVS. EDGVVORTH. BRISTLE. WASPE. HAGGISE.
JUSTICE. BVSY. PVRE-CRAFT. BY what warrant does it say so?


KNO. Ha^ mad child of the Pye-pouldres, art thou there? fill us a fresh kan,
Vrs, we may drink together.


TRO. I may not drink without a warrant, Captain.


KNO. S'lood, thou'll not stale without a warant, shortly. Whit, Give me pen,
ink and paper. I Will draw him a warrant presently.


TRO. It must be Justice Ouerdoo's?


KNO. I know, man, Fetch the drink, Whit.


WHI. I pre dee now, be very brief, Captain; for de new Ladies stay for dee.


KNO. O, as brief as can be, here it is already. Adam Ouerdoo.


TRO. Why, now, I Will pledge you, Captain.


KNO. Drink it off. I Will come to thee, anon, again.


QVA. Well, Sir. You are now discharged: Quarlous to the Cutpurse* beware of
being spied, hereafter.


EDG. Sir, will it please you, enter in here, at Vrsla's; and take part of a
silken gown, a velvet petticoate, or a wrought smock; I am promised such: and
I can spare any Gentleman a moity.


QVA. Keep it for your companions in beastliness, I am none of 'hem, Sir. If
I had not already forgiven you a greater trespass, or thought you yet worth my
beating, I would instruct your manners, to whom you made your offers. But go
your ways, talk not to me, the hangman is only fit to discourse with you;
the hand of Beadle is too merciful a punishment for your Trade of life. I am
sorry I employed this fellow; for he thinks me such: Facinus quos inquinat,
aequat. But, it was for sport. And would I make it serious, the getting of this
License is nothing to me, without other circumstances concur. I do think how
impertinently I labor, if the word be not mine, that the ragged fellow
marked: And what advantage I have given Ned Win-wife in this time now, of
working her, though it be mine. He Will go near to form to her what a
debauched Rascal I am, and fright her out of all good conceit of me: I should
do so by him, I am sure, if I had the opportunity. But my hope is in her
temper, yet; and it must needs be next to despair, that is grounded on any
part of a woman's discretion. I would give by my troth, now, all I could spare
(to my clothes, and my sword) to meet my tattered sooth-sayer again, who was
my judge in the question, to know certainly whose word he has damned or saved.
For, till then, I live but under a Repreiue. I must seek him. Who be these?


WAS. Ent Waspe with the officers. Sir, you are a welsh Cuckold, and a prating
Runt, and no Constable.


BRI. You say very well. Come put in his leg in the middle roundell, and let
him hole there.


WAS. You stink of leeks, Metheglyn, and chee^e. You Rogue.


BRI. Why, what is that to you, if you sit sweetly in the stocks in the mean
time? if you have a mind to stink too, your breeches sit close enough to your
bumm. Sit you merry, Sir.


QVA How now, Numps?


WAS. It is no matter, how; pray you look off.


QVA. Nay I Will not offend you, Numps. I thought you had sat there to be seen.


WAS. And to be sold, did you not? pray you mind your business, an' you have
any.


QVA. Cry you mercy, Numps. Does your leg lie high enough?


BRI. How now, neighbor Haggise, what says Justice Ouerdo's worship, to the
other offenders?


HAG. Why, he says just nothing, what should he say? Or where should he say?
He is not to be found, Man. He have not been seen in the Fair, here, all this
liue-long day, never since seven a clock in the morning. His Clearks know not
what to think on it. There is no Court of Pie-poulders yet. Here they be
returned.


BRI. What shall be done with 'hem, then? in your discretion?


HAG. I think we were best put 'hem in the stocks, in discretion (there they
will be safe in discretion) for the valor of an hour, or such a thing, till
his worship come. As they open the stocks, Waspe puts his shoe on his hand,
and slips it in for his leg.


BRI It is but a hole matter, if we do, Neighbor Haggise, come, Sir, here
is company for you, heave up the stocks.


WAS. I shall put a trick upon your welsh diligence, perhaps.


BRI. Put in your leg, Sir.


QVA. What, Rabby Busy! is he come?


BVS. I do obey thee, the Lion may roar, but he cannot bite. They bring Busy,
and put him in. I am glad to be thus separated from the heathen of the land,
and put a part in the stocks, for the holy cause.


WAS. What are you, Sir?


BVS. One that rejoices in his affliction, and sits here to prophecy, the
destruction of Fayres and May-games, Wakes, and Whitson-ales, and does sigh and
groan for the reformation, of these abuses.


WAS. And do you sigh, and groan too, or rejoice in your affliction?


IVS. I do not feel it, I do not think of it, it is a thing without me.
Adam, thou art above these battries, these contumelies. In te manca ruit
fortuna, as thy friend Horace says; thou art one, Quem neque pauperies, neque
mors, neque vincula terrent,. And therefore as another friend of thine says,
(I think it be thy friend Persius) Non te quaesi^cris extra.


QVA. What Is here! a Stoic in the stocks? the Fool is turned Philosopher.


BVS. Friend, I will leave to communicate my spirit with you, if I hear any
more of those superstitious relics, those lists of Latin, the very rags of
Rome, and patches of Popery.


WAS. Nay, an'you begin to quarrel, Gentlemen, I Will leave you. I have paid for
quarrelling too lately: look you, a device, He gets out. but shifting in a
hand for a foot. God b'w'you.


BVS. Will thou then leave thy brethren in tribulation?


WAS. For this once, Sir.


BVS. Thou art a halting Neutrall stay him there, stop him: that will not
endure the heat of persecution.


BRI. How now, what is the matter?


BVS. He is fled, he is fled, and dares not sit it out.


BRI. What, has he made an escape, which way? follow, neighbor Haggise.


PVR. O me! in the stocks! have the wicked prevailed?


BVS. Peace religious sister, it is my calling, comfort your self, an
extraordinary calling, and done for my better standing, my surer standing,
hereafter.


TRO. By whose warrant, by whose warrant, this? The madman enters.


QVA. O, here is my man! dropped in, I looked for.


IVS. Ha!


PVR. O good Sir, they have set the faithful, here to be wondered at; and
provided holes, for the holy of the land.


TRO. Had they warrant for it? showed they Iusticce Ouerdoo's hand? if they had
no warrant, they shall answer it.


BRI. Sure you did not lock the stocks sufficiently, neighbor Toby!


HAG. No! see if you can lock 'hem better.


BRI. They are very sufficiently locked, and truly, yet some thing is in the
matter.


TRO. True, your warrant is the matter that is in question, by what warrant?


BRI. Mad man, hold your peace, I will put you in his room else, in the very
same hole, do you see?


QVA. How! is he a madman!


TRO. Show me Justice Ouerdoo's warrant. I obey you.


HAG. You are a mad fool, hold your tongue.


TRO. Shows his Kanne. In Justice Ouerdoo's name, I drink to you, and here is
my warrant.


IVS. Alas poor wretch! how it earnes my heart for him!


QVA. If he be mad, it is in vain to question him. I Will try though, friend:
there was a Gentlewoman, showed you two names, some hour since, Argalus and
Palemon, to mark in a book, which of 'hem was it you marked?


TRO. I mark no name, but Adam Ouerdoo, that is the name of names, he only
is the sufficient Magistrate; and that name I reverence, show it me.


QVA. This fellows mad indeed: I am further off, now, then before.


IVS. I shall not breath in peace, till I have made him some amends.


QVA. Well, I will make another use of him, is come in my head: I have a nest
of beards in my Truncke, one some thing like his.


BRI. The watchmen come back again. The madman fights with 'hem, and they
leave open the stocks. This mad fool has made me that I know not whether I I
have locked the stocks or no, I think I locked 'hem.


TRO. Take Adam Ouerdoo in your mind, and fear nothing.


BRI. S'lid, madness it self, hold thy peace, and take that.


TRO. Strikest thou without a warrant? take thou that.


BVS. We are delivered by miracle; fellow in fetters, let us not refuse the
means, this madness was of the spirit: The malice of the enemy has mocked it
self.


PVR. Mad do they call him! the world is mad in error, but he is mad in
truth: I love him of the sudden, (the cunning man said all true) and shall love
him more, and more. How well it becomes a man to be mad in truth! O, that I
might be his yoake-fellow, and be mad with him, what a many should we draw to
madness in truth, with us!


BRI. How now! all escaped? where is the woman? it is witchcraft! The watch
missing them are affrighted. Her velvet hat is a witch, of my conscience, or my
key! the one. The madman was a Devil, and I am an Ass; so bless me, my place,
and mine office.


ACT. V. SCENE. I.
LANTERN. FILCHER. SHARKVVEL. WEll, Luck and Saint Bartholmew; out with the
sign of our invention, in the name of Wit, and do you beat the Drum, the
while; All the foul in the Fair, I mean, all the dirt in Smithfield, (that is
one of Master Littlewit's Carwhitchets now) will be thrown at our Banner to
day, if the matter does not please the people. O the Motions, that I Lantern
Leatherhead have given light to, in my time, since my Master Pod dyed!
Jerusalem was a stately thing; and so was Niniue, and the city of Norwich, and
Sodom and Gomorrah; Pod was a Master of motions before him.
with the rising of the prentises; and pulling down the bawdy houses there,
upon Shroue-Tuesday; but the Gunpowder-plot, there was a get-penny! I have
presented that to an eighteen, or twenty pence audience, nine times in an
afternoon. Your home-borne proiects prove ever the best, they are so easy,
and familiar, they put too much learning i'their things now o'dayes: and that I
fear will be the spoil of this. Little-wit? I say, Mickle-wit! if not too
mickle! look to your gathering there, good man Filcher.


FILL. I warrant you, Sir.


LAN. And there come any Gentlefolks, take two pence a piece, Sharkwell.


SHA. I warrant you, Sir, three pence, an'we can.


ACT. V. SCENE. II.
JUSTICE. WIN-WIFE. GRACE. QVARLOVS. PVRE-CRAFT. THis later disguise, I have
borrowed of a Porter, shall carry me out to all my great and good ends; The
Justice comes in like a Porter. which how ever interrupted, were never
destroyed in me: neither is the hour of my severity yet come, to reveal my
self, wherein cloud-like, I will break out in rain, and hail, lightning,
and thunder, upon the head of enormity. Two maine works I have to prosecute:
first, one is to invent some satisfaction for the poor, kind wretch, who is
out of his wits for my sake, and yonder I see him coming, I will walk aside,
and project for it.


WIN. I wonder where Tom Quarlous is, that he returns not, it may be he is
struck in here to seek us.


GRA. See, here is our madman again.


QVA. I have made my self as like him, as his gown, and cap will give me
leave. Quarlous in the habit of the madman is mistaken by Mrs Pure-craft.


PVR. Sir, I love you, and would be glad to be mad with you in truth.


WIN-W. How! my widow in love with a madman?


PVR. Verily, I can be as mad in spirit, as you.


QVA. By whose warrant? leave your canting. Gentlewoman, have I found you?
(save ye, quit ye, and multiply ye) where is your book? He desires to see
the book of Mistress Grace.
'twas a sufficient name I marked, let me see it, be not afraid to shew't me.


GRA. What would you with it, Sir?


QVA. Mark it again, and again, at your service.


GRA. Here it is, Sir, this was it you marked.


QVA. Palemon? fare you well, fare you well.


WIN-W. How, Palemon!


GRA. Yes faith, he has discovered it to you, now, and therefore 'twere vain
to disguise it longer, I am yours, Sir, by the benefit of your fortune.


WIN-W. And you have him Mistress, believe it, that shall never give you cause
to repent her benefit, but make you rather to think that in this choice, she
had both her eyes.


GRA. I desire to put it to no danger of protestation.


QVA. Palemon, the word, and Win-wife the man?


PVR. Good Sir, vouchsafe a yoakefellow in your madness, shun not one of the
sanctified sisters, that would draw with you, in truth.


QVA. Away, you are a heard of hypocritical proud Ignorants, rather wild,
then mad. Fitter for woods, and the society of beasts then houses, and the
congregation of men. You are the second part of the society of Canters,
Outlawes to order and Discipline, and the only priuiledg'd Church-robbers of
Christendom. Let me alone. Palemon, the word, and Winwife the man?


PVR. I must uncover my self unto him, or I shall never enjoy him, for all the
cunning men's promises. Good Sir, hear me, I am worth six thousand pound, my
love to you, is become my rack, I Will tell you all, and the truth: since you
hate the hyporisie of the party-colored brotherhood. These seven years, I
have been a wilful holy widow, only to draw feasts, and gifts from my
entangled suitors: I am also by office, an assisting sister of the Deacons, and
a deuourer, in stead of a distributer of the alms. I am a special maker of
marriages for our decayed Brethren, with our rich widows; for a third part of
their wealth, when they are married, for the relief of the poor elect: as
also our poor handsome young Virgins, with our wealthy Batchelors, or
Widdowers; to make them steal from their husbands, when I have confirmed them
in the faith, and got all put into their custodies. And if I have not my
bargain, they may sooner turn a scolding drab, in to a silent Minister, then
make me leave pronouncing reprobation, and damnation unto them. Our elder,
Zeale-of-the-land, would have had me, but I know him to be the capital Knave
of the land, making himself rich, by being made Feoffee in trust to deceased
Brethren, and coozning their heirs, by swearing the absolute gift of their
inheritance. And thus having eased my conscience, and vtter'd my heart, with
the tongue of my love: enjoy all my deceits together. I beseech you. I should
not have revealed this to you, but that in time I think you are mad, and I
hope you will think me so too, Sir?


QVA. Stand aside, I Will answer you, presently. He consider with himself of it.
Why should not I marry this six thousand pound, now I think on it? and a good
trade too, that she has beside, ha? The the other wench, Winwife, is sure of;
there is no expectation for me there! here I may make my self some sauer, yet,
if she continue mad, there is the question. It is money that I want, why should
I not marry the money, when it is offered me? I have a License and all, it is
but razing out one name, and putting in another. There Is no playing with a
man's fortune! I am resolved! I were truly mad, an' I would not! well, come
your ways, follow me, an' you will be mad, He takes her along with him.

The Justice calls him.


I Will show you a warrant!


PVR. Most zealously, it is that I zealously desire.


IVS. Sir, let me speak with you.


QVA. By whose warrant?


IVS. The warrant that you tender, and respect so; Justice Ouerdoo's! I am the
man, friend Trouble-all, though thus disguised (as the careful Magistrate
ought) for the good of the Republique, in the Fair, and the weeding out of
enormity. Do you want a house or meat, or drink, or clothes? speak
whatsoever it is, it shall be supplied you, what want you?


QVA. Nothing but your warrant.


IVS. My warrant? for what?


QVA. To be gone, Sir.


IVS. Nay, I pray thee stay, I am serious, and have not many words, nor much
time to exchange with thee; think what may do thee good.


QVA. Your hand and seal, will do me a great deal of good; nothing else in
the whole Fair, that I know.


IVS. If it were to any end, thou should have it willingly.


QVA. Why, it will satisfy me, that is end enough, to look on; an' you will
not gi' it me, let me go.


IVS. Alas! thou shall have it presently: I Will but step into the Scriueners, The
Justice goes out. hereby, and bring it. Do not go away.


QVA. Why, this mad man's shape, will prove a very fortunate one, I think! can
a ragged robe produce these effects? if this be the wise Justice, and he bring
me his hand, I shall go near to make some use on it. He is come already!


IVS. and returns. Look thee! here is my hand and seal, Adam Ouerdoo, if
there be any thing to be written, above in the paper, that thou want now, or
at any time hereafter; think on it; it is my deed, I deliver it so, can your
friend write?


QVA. He urges Mistress Purecraft. Her hand for a witness, and all is well.


IVS. With all my heart.


QVA. Why should not I have the conscience, to make this a bond of a thousand
pound? now, or what I would else?


IVS. Look you, there it is; and I deliver it as my deed again.


QVA. Let us now proceed in madness.


IVS. He takes her in with him. Well, my conscience is much eased; I have done
my part, though it does him no good, yet Adam has offered satisfaction! The
sting is removed from hence: poor man, he is much altered with his affliction,
it has brought him low! Now, for my other work, reducing the young man (I have
followed so long in love) from the brinke of his bane, to the center of safety.
Here, or in some such like vain place, I shall be sure to find him. I will
wait the good time.


ACT. V. SCENE. IIJ.
COKES. SHAKRVVEL. JUSTICE. FILCHER. JOHN. LANTERN. HOw now? what is here to
do? friend, art thou the Master of the Monuments?


SHA. It Is a Motion, an't please your worship.


IVS. My fantastical brother in Law, Master Bartholmew Cokes!


COK. A Motion, what is that? He reads the Bill. The ancient modern history of
Hero, and Leander, otherwise called The Touchstone of true Love, with as true a
trial of friendship, between Damon, and Pithias, two faithful friends of the
Bankside? pretty in faith, what is the meaning on it? is it an Interlude? or what
is it?


FILL. Yes Sir, please you come near, we will take your money within.


COK. Back with these children; The boys of the Fair follow him. they do so
follow me up and down.


IOH. By your leave, friend.


FILL. You must pay, Sir, an' you go in.


IOH. Who, I? I perceive thou know not me: call the Master of the Motion.


SHA What, do you not know the Author, fellow Filcher? you must take no money
of him; he must come in gratis: Mr. Little-wit is a voluntary; he is the Author.


IOH. Peace, speak not too loud, I would not have any notice taken, that I am
the Author, till we see how it passes.


COK. Master Littlewit, how do thou?


IOH. Master Cokes! you are exceeding well met: what, in your doublet, and
hose, without a cloak, or a hat?


COK. I would I might never stir, as I am an honest man, and by that fire; I
have lost all in the Fair, and all my acquaintance too; did thou meet any
body that I know, Master Littlewit? my man Numps, or my sister Ouerdoo, or
Mistress Grace? pray thee Master Littlewit, lend me some money to see the
Interlude, here. I Will pay thee again, as I am a Gentleman. If thou wilt but
carry me home, I have money enough there.


IOH. O, Sir, you shall command it, what, will a crown serve you?


COK. I think it well, what do we pay for coming in, fellows?


FILL. Two pence, Sir.


COK. Two pence? there is twelve pence, friend; Nay, I am a Gallant, as simple
as I look now; if you see me with my man about me, and my Artillery, again.


IOH. Your man was in the Stocks, even now, Sir.


COK. Who, Numps?


IOH. Yes faith.


COK. For what in says, I am glad of that; remember to tell me on it anon; I
have enough, now! What manner of matter is this, Mr. Little wit? What kind of
Actors have you? Are they good Actors?


IOH. Pretty youths, Sir, all children both old and young, here is the Master of
'hem --


(LAN. Leatherhead whispers to Littl-wit. Call me not Leatherhead, but
Lantern.)


IOH. Master Lantern, that gives light to the business,


COK* In good time, Sir, I would feign see 'hem, I would be glad drink with
the young company; which is the Tiring-house?


LAN. Troth, Sir, our Tiring-house is somewhat little, we are but beginners,
yet, pray pardon us; you cannot go upright in it.


COK. No? not now my hat is off? what would you have done with me, if you had
had me, feather, and all, as I was once to day? Have you none of your pretty
impudent boys, now; to bring stools, fill Tobacco, fetch Ale, and beg money,
as they have at other houses? let me see some o'your Actors.


ION. Show him 'hem, show him 'hem. Master Lantern, this is a Gentleman, that
is a fauorer of the quality.


IVS. I, the favoring of this licencious quality, is the consumption of many a
young Gentleman; a pernicious enormity.


COK. What, do they live in baskets?


LEA. He brings them out in a basket. They do lie in a basket, Sir, they are
of the small Players.


COK. These be Players minors, indeed. Do you call these Players?


LAN. They are Actors, Sir, and as good as any, none disprais'd, for dumb
shows: indeed, I am the mouth of 'hem all!


COK. Thy mouth will hold 'hem all. I think, one Tailor, would go near to
beat all this company, with a hand bound behind him.


IOH. I, and eat 'hem all, too, an' they were in cake-bread.


COK. I thank you for that, Master Littlewit, a good ^est! which is your
Burbage now?


LAN. What mean you by that, Sir?


COK. Your best Actor. Your Field?


IOH. Good in faith! you are even with me, Sir.


LAN. This is he, that acts young Leander, Sir. He is extremely beloved of the
womenkind, they do so affect his action, the green gamesters, that come here,
and this is lovely Hero; this with the beard, Damon; and this pretty Pythias:
this is the ghost of King Dionysius in the habit of a scriuener: as you shall
see anon, at large.


COK. Well they are a civil company, I like 'hem for that; they offer not to
fleere, nor geere, nor break jests, as the great Players do: And then, there
goes not so much charge to the feasting of 'hem, or making 'hem drunk, as to
the other, by reason of their littleness. Do they use to play perfect? Are
they never fluster'd?


LAN. No, Sir. I thank my industry, and policy for it; they are as well
governed a company, though I say it -- And here is young Leander, is as proper
an Actor of his inches; and shakes his head like an hostler.


COK. But do you play it according to the printed book? I have read that.


LAN. By no means, Sir.


COK. No? How then?


LAN. A better way, Sir, that is too learned, and poetical for our audience;
what do they know what Hellespont is? Guilty of true loves blood? or what
Abidos is? or the other Sestos hight?


COK. Thou Art in the right, I do not know my self.


LAN. No, I have entreated Master Littlewit, to take a little pains to reduce
it to a more familiar strain for our people.


COK. How, I pray thee, good Mr. Littlewit?


IOH. It pleases him to make a matter of it, Sir. But there is no such matter I
assure you: I have only made it a little easy, and modern for the times,
Sir, that is all; As, for the Hellespont I imagine our Thames here; and then
Leander, I make a Diers son, about Puddle-wharfe: and Hero a wench of the
Banke-side, who going over one morning, to old fish-street; Leander spies her
land at Trigsstayers, and falls in love with her: Now do I introduce Cupid,
having Metamorphos'd himself into a Drawer, and he strikes Hero in love with
a pint of Sherry, and other pretty passages there are, of the friendship, that
will delight you, Sir, and please you of judgment.


COK. I Will be sworn they shall; I am in love with the Actors already, and I Will
be allied to them presently. (They respect gentlemen, these fellows) Hero
shall be my fayring: But, which of my fayrings? (Le' me see) in faith, my
fiddle! and Leander my fiddle-sticke: Then Damon, my drum; and Pythias, my Pipe
and the ghost of Dionysius, my hobbyhorse. All fitted.


ACT. V. SCENE IV.
To them WIN-WIFE. GRACE. KNOCKHVM. WHITT. EDGVVORTH. VVIN. Mistress OVERDOO.
And to them VVASPE. Look yonder is your Cokes gotten in among his
play-fellowes; I thought we could not miss him, at such a Spectacle.


GRA. Let him alone, he is so busy, he will never spy us.


LEA. Nay, good Sir.


COK. Cokes is handling the Puppets.
I warrant thee, I will not hurt her, fellow; what do think me uncivil? I
pray thee be not jealous: I am toward a wife.


IOH* Well good Master Lantern, make ready to begin, that I may fetch my wife,
and look you be perfect, you undo me else, i'my reputation.


LAN. I warrant you Sir, do not you breed too great an expectation of it,
among your friends: that is the only hurter of these things.


IOH. No, no, no.


COK. I Will stay here, and see; pray thee let me see.


WIN-VV. How diligent and troublesome he is!


GRA. The place becomes him, me thinks.


IVS. My ward, Mistress Grace in the company of a stranger? I doubt I shall be
compelled to discover my self, before my time!


FILL. Two pence a piece Gentlemen, an excellent Motion.


KNO. The doore-keepers speak. Shall we have fine fireworks, and good vapors!


SHA. Yes Captain, and waterworks, too.


WHI. I pree dee, take a care o'dy shmall Lady, there, Edgworth; I will look
to dish tall Lady my self.


LAN. Welcome Gentlemen, welcome Gentlemen.


WHI. Predee, Mashter o'de Monshtersh, help a very sick Lady, here, to a
chair, to shit in.


LAN. Presently, Sir.


WHI. They bring Mistr^s Ouerdoo a chair. Good fait now, Vrsla's Ale, and
Aqua-vitae ish to blame for it; shit down shweet heart, shit down* and shleep
a little.


EDG. Madame, you are very welcome hither.


KNO. Yes, and you shall see very good vapors.


IVS. Here is my care come! I like to see him in so good company; By Edgeworth.
and yet I wonder that persons of such fashion, should resort hither!


EDG. This is a very private house, Madame. The Cutpurse courts Mistress
Litt^^ wit.



LAN. Will it please your Ladyship sit, Madame?


WIN. Yes good man. They do so all to be Madame me, I think they think me a
very Lady!


EDG. What else Madame?


WIN. Must I put off my masque to him?


EDG. O, by no means.


WIN. How would my husband know me, then?


KNO. Husband? an idle vapor; he must not know you, nor you ^im; there is the
true vapor.


IVS. Y^^, I will observe more of this: is this a Lady, friend?


WHI. I and (...) is anoder Lady, shweet heart; if dou hasht a mind to 'hem
gi^e me twelve pence from tee, and dou shall have eder-oder on 'hem!


IVS. I? This will prove my chiefest enormity: I will follow this.


EDG, Is not this a finer life, Lady, then to be clogged with a husband?


WIN. Yes, a great deal. When will they begin, trow? in the name of the
Motion?


EDG. By and by Madame, they stay but for company.


KNO. Do you hear, Puppet. Master, these are tedious vapors; when begin you?


LAN. We stay but for Master Littlewit, the Author, who is gone for his wife;
and we begin presently.


WIN. That Is I, that is I.


EDG. That was you, Lady; but now you are no such poor thing.


KNO. Hang the Authors wife, a running vapor! here be Ladies, will stay for
nere a Delia o'hem all.


WHI. But hear me now, here ish one o'de Ladish, a shleep, stay till she
but vake man.


WAS. How now friends? what is here to do?


FILL. Two pence a piece, Sir, the best Motion, in the Fair. The doore-keepers
again.



WAS. I believe you lie; if you do, I Will have my money again, and beat you.


WIN. Numps is come!


WAS. Did you see a Master of mine, come in here, a tall young Squire of Harrow
of the Hill; Master Bartholmew Cokes?


FILL. I think there be such a one, within.


WAS. Look he be, you were best: but it is very likely: I wonder I found him
not at all the rest. I have been at the Eagle, and the black Wolf, and the
Bull with the five legs, and two pizzles; (he was a Calfe at Vxbridge Fair,
two years agone) And at the dogs that dance the Morris, and the Hare of
the Taber; and mist him at all these! Sure this must needs be some fine sight,
that holds him so, if it have him.


COK. Come, come, are you ready now?


LAN. Presently, Sir.


WAS. Hoyday, he is at work in his Dublet, and hose; do you hear, Sir? are
you employed? that you are bare headed, and so busy?


COK. Hold your peace, Numpes; you have been in the Stocks, I hear.


WAS. Does he know that? nay, then the date of my Authority is out; I must
think no longer to reign, my government is at an end. He that will correct
another, must want fault in himself.


WIN-W. Sententious Numps! I never heard so much from him, before.


LAN. Sure, Master Littlewit will not come; please you take your place, Sir,
we will begin.


COK. I pray thee do, mine ears long to be at it; and my eyes too. O Numps,
in the Stocks, Numps? where is your sword, Numps?


WAS. I pray you intend your game, Sir, let me alone.


COK. Well then, we are quit for all. Come, sit down, Numps; I Will interpret to
thee: did you see Mistress Grace? it is no matter, neither, now I think on it,
tell me anon.


WIN-W. A great deal of love, and care, he expresses.


GRA. Alas! would you have him to express more then he has? that were tyranny.


COK. Peace, ho; now, now.


LAN. Gentles, that no longer your expectations may wander,
Behold our chief Actor, amorous Leander.
With a great deal of cloth, lap'd about him like a Scarf,
For he yet serves his father, a Dyer at Puddle wharfe,
Which place we will make bold with, to call it our Abidus,
As the Banke-side is our Sestos, and let it not be denied us.
Now, as he is beating, to make the Dye take the fuller,
Who chances to come by, but fair Hero, in a Sculler;
And seeing Leanders naked leg, and goodly calfe,
Cast at him, from the boat, a Sheep eye, and a half.
Now she is landed, and the Sculler come back;
By and by, you shall see what Leander does lack.

PVP. L. Cole, Cole, old Cole.


LAN. That is the Scullers name without control.


PVP. L. Cole, Cole, I say, Cole.


LAN. We do hear you.


PVP. L. Old Cole.


LAN Old cole? Is the Dyer turned Collier? how do you sell?


PVP. L. A pox o'your manners, kiss my hole here, and smell.


LAN. Kiss your hole, and smell? there is manners indeed.


PVP. L. Why, Cole, I say, Cole.


LAN. It Is the Sculler you need!


PVP. L. I, and be hanged.


LAN. Be hanged; look you yonder,
Old Cole, you must go hang with Master Leander.

PVP. C. Where is he?


PVP. L. Here, Cole, what fayerest of Fayers, was that fare, that thou landedst
but now a Trigsstayres?


COK. What was that, fellow? Pray thee tell me, I scarce understand 'hem.


LAN. Leander does ask, Sir, what fairest of Fayers,
Was the fare thhe landed, but now, at Trigsstayers?

PVP. C. It is lovely Hero.


PVP. L. Nero?


PVP. C. No, Hero.


LAN. It is Hero.
Of the Bankside, he says* to tell you truthwith out erring,
Is come over into Fish-street to eat some fresh herring.
Leander says no more, but as fast as he can,
Gets on all his best clothes; and will after to the Swan.

COK. Most admirable good, is it not?


LAN. Stay, Sculler.


PVP. C. What say you?


LAN. You must stay for Leander, and carry him to the wench.


PVP. C. You Rogue, I am no Pandar.


COK. He says he is no Pandar. It Is a fine language; I understand it, now.


LAN. Are you no Pandar, Goodman Cole? here is no man says you are, You Will grow
a hot Cole, it seems, pray you stay for your fare.


PVP. C. Will he come away?


LAN. What do you say?


PVP. C. I Would have him come away.


LEA. Would you have Leander come away? why 'pray' Sir, stay.
You are angry, Goodman Cole; I believe the fair Maid
Came over w' you a' trust: tell us Sculler, are you paid.

PVP. C. Yes Goodman Hogrubber, of Pickt-hatch.


LAV: How, Hogrubber, of Pickt-hatch?


PVP. C. I Hogrubber of Pickt-hatch. Take you that.


LAN. O, my head! The Puppet strikes him over the pate

PVP. C. Harm watch, harm catch.


COK. Harm watch, harm catch, he says: very good in faith, the Sculler had
like to have knocked you, sirrah.


LAN. Yes, but that his fare called him away.


PVP. L. Row apace, row apace, row, row, row, row, row.


LAN. You are knauishly laden, Sculler, take heed where you go.


PVP. C. Knave in your face, Goodman Rogue.


PVP. L Row, row, row, row, row, row.


COK. He said knave in your face, friend.


LAN. I Sir, I heard him. But there is no talking to these water^men, they will
have the last word


COK. God's my life! I am not allied to the Sculler, yet; he shall be Dauphin
my boy. But my Fiddle-sticke does fiddle in and out too much; I pray thee
speak to him, on it: tell him, I would have him tarry in my sight, more.


LAN. I Pray you be content; you will have enough on him, Sir.

Now gentles, I take it, here is none of you so stupid,
but that you have heard of a little god of love, called Cupid.
Who out of kindness to Leander, hearing he but (aw her,
this present day and hour, does turn himself to a Drawer.
And because, he would have their first meeting to be merry,
he strikes Hero in love to him, with a pint of Sherry.
Which he tells her* from amorous Leander is sent her,
PVP. Leander goes into Mistress Hero's room who after him, into the room of
Hero, does venture.

PVP. IO: A pint of sack, score a pint of sack, in the Conney.


COK. Sack? you said but even now it should be Sherry.


PVP. IO: Why so it is; sherry, sherry, sherry.


COK. Sherry, sherry, sherry. By my troth he makes me merry. I must have a name
for Cupid, too. Let me see, thou might help me now, an' thou would,
Numps, at a dead lift, but thou art dreaming of the stocks, still! Do not
think on it, I have forgot it: it is but a nine days wonder, man; let it not
trouble thee.


WAS. I would the stocks were about your neck, Sir; condition I hung by the
heels in them, till the wonder were off from you, with all my heart.


COK. Well said resolute Numps: but hark you friend, where is the friendship,
all this while, between my Drum, Damon; and my Pipe, Pythias?


LAN. You shall see by and by, Sir?


COK. You think my Hobbyhorse is forgotten, too; no, I Will see* 'hem all enact
before I go; I shall not know which to love best, else


KNO. This Gallant has interrupting vapors, troublesome vapors, Whitt, puff
with him.


WHIT. No, I pre dee, Captain, let him alone. He is a Child in faith, la'.


LAN. Now gentles, to the friends, who in number, are two,
and lodged in that Alehouse, in which fair Hero does do.
Damon (for some kindness done him the last week)
is come fair Hero, in Fish-streete, this morning to seek:
Pythias does smell the knavery of the meeting,
and now you shall see their true friendly greeting.

PVP. Pi. You whore-masterly Slave, you^


COK. Whore-masterly slave, you? very friendly, and familiar, that.


PVP. Da. Whore-master i'thy face,
Thou have lien with her thy self, I Will proue't i'this place.

COK. Damon says Pythias has lien with her, himself, he will prooue't in this
place.


LAN. They are Whore-masters both, Sir, that is a plain case.


PVP. Pi. You lie, like a Rogue.


LAN. Do I ly, like a Rogue?


PVP. Pi. A Pimpe, and a Scabbe.


LAN. A Pimpe, and a Scabbe?
I say between you, you have both but one Drabbe.

PVP. Da. You lie again.


LAN. Do I lie again?


PVP. Da. Like a Rogue again.


LAN. Like a Rogue again?


PVP. Pi. And you are a Pimpe, again.


COK. And you are a Pimpe again, he says.


PVP. Da. And a Scabbe, again.


COK. And a Scabbe again, he says.


LAN. And I say again, you are both whore-masters again, They fight.
and you have both but one Drabbe again.

PVP. Da. Pi. Do thou, do thou, do thou?


AN. What, both at once?


PVP. P. Down with him, Damon


PVP. D. Pinke his guts, Pythias*


LAN. What, so malicious?
will ye murder me, Masters both, i'mine own house?

COK. Ho! well acted my Drum, well acted my Pipe, well acted still.


WAS. Well acted, with all my heart.


LAN. Hld, hold your hands


COK. I, both your hands, for* my sake! for you have both done well.


PVP. D. Gramercy pure Pythias.


PVP. P. Gramercy, Dear Damon.


COK. Gramercy to you both, my Pipe, and my drum.


PVP. P. D. Come now we will together to breakfast to Hero.


LAN. It Is well, you can now go to breakfast to Hero, you have given many
breakfast, with a hone and honero.


COK. How is it friend, have they hurt thee?


LAN. O no!
Between you and I Sir, we do but make show.
Thus Gentles you perceive, without any denial,
'twixt Damon and Pythias here, friendships true trial.
Though hourly they quarrel thus, and roar each with other,
they fight you no more, then does brother with brother.
But friendly together, at the next man they meet,
they let fly their anger as here you might see it.

COK. Well, we have seen't, and thou have felt it, whatsoever thou say,
what is next? what is next?


LEA. This while young Leander, with fair Hero is drinking,
and Hero grown drunk, to any man's thinking!
Yet was it not three pints of Sherry could flaw her.
till Cupid distinguished like Jonas the Drawer,
From under his apron, where his lechery lurkes,
put love in her Sack. Now mark how it works.

PVP. H. O Leander Leander, my dear my dear Leander,
I Will for ever be thy goose, so thou wilt be my gander^

COK. Excellently well said, Fiddle, she will ever be his goose, so he will be
her gander: was it not so?


LAN. Yes, Sir, but mark his answer, now:

PVP. L^ And sweetest of geese, before I go to bed,
I Will swim over the Thames, my goose, thee to tread.

COK. Brave! he will swim over the Thames, and tread his goose, too night, he
says.


LAN. I, peace, Sir, the'll be angry, if they hear you eaues-dropping, now
they are setting their match.


PVP. L. But lest the Thames should be dark, my goose, my dear friend, let thy
window be provided of a candles end.


PVP. H. Fear not my gander, I protest, I should handle my matters very ill,
if I had not a whole candle.


PVP. L. Well then, look to it, and kiss me to boot.


LAN. Now, here come the friends again, Pythias, and Damon, and under their
clokes, Damon and Pythias enter. they have of Bacon, a gammon.


PVP. P. Drawer, fill some wine here.


LAN. How, some wine there? there is company already, Sir, pray forbear!


PVP. D. It Is Hero.


LAN. Yes, but she will not be taken, after sack, and fresh herring, with
your Dunmow- bacon.


PVP. P You lie, it is Westfabian.


LAN. Westphalian you should say.


PVP. D. Leander and Hero are kissing. If you hold not your peace, you are a
Coxcombe, I would say.


PVP. What Is here? what is here? kiss, kiss, upon kiss.


LAN. I, Wherefore should they not? what harm is in this? it is Mistress Hero.


PVP. D. Mistress Hero's a whore.


LAN. Is she a whore? keep you quiet, or Sir Knave out of door.


PVP. D. Knave out of door?


PVP. H. Yes, Knave, out of door.


PVP. D. Whore out of door.


PVP. H. Here the Puppets quarrel and fall together by the ears. I say,
Knave, out of door.


PVP. D. I say, whore, out of door.


PVP. P. Yea, so say I too.


PVP. H. Kiss the whore of the arse.


LAN. Now you have something to do: you must kiss her of the arse she says:


PVP. D. P. So we will, so we will.


PVP. H. O my hanches, O my hanches, hold, hold.


LAN. Stand'st thou still?
Leander, where art thou? stand'st thou still like a sot,
and not offer'st to break both their heads with a pot?
See who is at thine elbow, there! Puppet Jonas and Cupid.

PVP. I. Vpon'hem Leander, be not so stupid. They fight.


PVP. L. You Goat-bearded slave!


PVP. D. You whore-master Knave.


PVP. L. Thou art a whore-master.


PVP. I. Whore-masters all.


LAN. See, Cupid with a word has taken up the brawle.


KNO. These be fine vapors!


COK. By this good day they fight bravely! do they not, Numps?


WAS. Yes, they lacked but you to be their second, all this while.


LAN. This tragical encounter, falling out thus to busy us,
It raises up the ghost of their friend Dionysius:
Not like a Monarch, but the Master of a School,
in a Scriueners furred gown, which shows he is no fool.
for therein he has wit enough to keep himself warm.
O Demon he cries, and Pythias; what harm,
Has poor Dionysius done you in his grave,
That after his death, you should fall out thus, and rave,
And call amorous Leander whore-master Knave?

PVP. D. I cannot, I will not, I promise you endure it.


ACT. V. SCENE. V.
To them BVSY. BVS. Down with Dagon, down with Dagon; it is I, will no longer
endure your prophanations.


LAN. What mean you, Sir?


BVS. I will remove Dagon there, I say, that Idol, that heathenish Idol, that
remains (as I may say) a beam, a very beam, not a beam of the Sun, nor a
beam of the Moon, nor a beam of a balance, neither a house-beame, nor a
Weauers beam, but a beam in the eye, in the eye of the brethren; a very great
beam, an exceeding great beam; such as are your Stage players, Rimers, and
Morrise-dancers, who have walked hand in hand, in contempt of the Brethren, and
the Cause; and been borne out by instruments, of no mean countenance.


LAN. Sir, I present nothing, but what is licensed by authority.


BAS. Thou art all license, even licentiousness it self, Shimei!


LAN. I have the Master of the Reuell's hand for it, Sir.


BVS. The Master of Rebels hand, thou have; Satan's! hold thy peace, thy
scurrility shut up thy mouth, thy profession is damnable, and in pleading for
it, thou do plead for Baal. I have long opened my mouth wide, and gaped, I
have gaped as the oyster for the tide after thy destruction* but cannot
compass it by suit, or dispute; so thar I look for a bickering, ere long, and
then a battle.


KNO. Good Banbury-vapours.


COK. Friend, you would have an ill match on it, if you bicker with him here,
though he be no man of the fist, he has friends that will go to cuffes for
him, Numps, will not you take our side?


EDG. Sir, it shall not need, in my mind; he offers him a fairer course, to
end it by disputation! have thou nothing to say for thy self, in defense of
thy quality?


LAN. Faith, Sir, I am not well studied in these controversies, between the
hypocrites and us. But here is one of my Motion, Puppet Donisius shall undertake
him, and I Will venture the cause on it.


COK. Who? my Hobbyhorse? will he dispute with him?


LAN. Yes, Sir, and make a Hobby-Asse of him, I hope.


COK. That Is excellent! indeed he looks like the best scholar of 'hem all.
Come, Sir, you must be as good as your word, now.


BVS. I will not fear to make my spirit, and gifts known! assist me zeal,
fill me, fill me, that is, make me full.


WIN-W. What a desperate, profane wretch is this! is there any Ignorance, or
impudence like his? to call his zeal to fill him against a Puppet?


QVA. I know no fitter mat^h, then a Puppet to commit with an Hypocrite!


BVS. First, I say unto thee, Idol, thou have no Calling.


PVP. D. You lie, I am called Dionisius.


LAN. The Motion says you lie, he is called Dionisius ithe matter, and to that
calling he answers.


BVS. I mean no vocation, Idol, no present lawful Calling.


PVP. D. Is yours a lawful Calling?


LAN. The Motion asks, if yours be a lawful Calling?


BVS. Yes, mine is of the Spirit.


PVP. D. Then Idol is a lawful Calling.


LAN. He says, then Idol is a lawful Calling! for you called him Idol, and
your Calling is of the spirit.


COK. Well disputed, Hobbyhorse!


BVS. Take not part with the wicked young Gallant* He neygheth and hinneyeth,
all is but her nying Sophistry. I call him Idol again. Yet, I say, his
Calling, his Profession is profane, it is profane, Idol.


PVP. D. It is not profane!


LAN. It is not profane, he says.


BVS. It is profane.


PVP. It is not profane.


BVS. It is profane.


PVP. It is not profane.


LAN Well said, confute him with not, still. You cannot bear him down with
your base noise, Sir.


BVS. Nor he me, with his treble creeking, though he creek like the chariot
wheels of Satan; I am zealous for the Cause --


LAN. As a dog for a bone.


BVS. And I say, it is profane, as being the Page of Pride, and the waiting
woman of vanity.


PVP. D. Yea? what say you to your Tire-women, then?


LAN. Good.


PVP. Or feather-makers in the Friars, that are o'your faction of faith? Are not
they with their perrukes, and their puffes, their fannes, and their huffes, as
much Pages of Pride, and waiters upon vanity? what say you? what say you? what
say you?


BVS. I will not answer for them.


PVP. Because you cannot, because you cannot. Is a Bugle-maker a lawful
Calling? or the Confect-makers? such you have there: or your French Fashioner?
you would have all the sin within your selves, would you not? would you not?


BVS. No, Dagon.


PVS. What then, Dagonet? is a Puppet worse then these?


BVS. Yes, and my maine argument against you, is, that you are an abomination:
for the Male, among you, puts on the apparel of the Female, and the Female
of the Male.


PVP. You lie, you lie, you lie abominably.


COK. Good, by my troth, he has given him the lie thrice.


PVP. It is your old stale argument against the Players, but it will not hold
against the Puppets; for we have neither Male nor Female amongst us. And that
thou may see, if thou will, The Puppet takes up his garment. like a
malicious purblinde zeal as thou art!


EDG. By my faith, there he has answered you, friend; by plain demonstration.


PVP. Nay, I Will prove, against ere a Rabbin of'hem all, that my standing is as
lawful as his; that I speak by inspiration, as well as he; that I have as
little to do with learning as he; and do scorn her helps as much as he.


BVS, I am confuted, the Cause has failed me.


PVS. Then be converted, be converted.


LAN. Be converted, I pray you, and let the Play go on!


BVS. Let it go on. For I am changed, and will become a beholder with you!


COK. That Is brave i'saith, thou have carried it away, Hobbyhorse, on with the
Play!


IVS. Stay, now do I forbid, I Adam Ouerdoo! sit still, I charge you. The
Justice discouers himself.


COK. What, my Brother i'law!


GRA. My wise Guardian!


EDG. Justice Ouerdoo!


IVS. It is time, to take Enormity by the fore head, and brand it* for, I have
discovered enough.


ACT. V. SCENE. VI.
To them, QVARLOVS. ( like the Madman) PVRE-CRAFT. ( a while after) JOHN. to
them TROVBLE-ALL. VRSLA. NIGHTIGALE. QVAR. Nay, come Mistress Bride. You must
do as I do, now. You must be mad with me, in truth. I have here Justice
Ouerdoo for it.


IVS. Peace good Trouble-all; come hither, and you shall trouble n^ne. To the
Cutpurse, and Mistress Litwit. I will take the charge of you, and your friend
too, you also, young man shall be my care, stand there.


EDG. Now, mercy upon me.


KNO. Would we were away, Whit, these are dangerous vapors, The rest are
stealing away. best fall off with our birds, for fear of the Cage.


IVS. Stay, is not my name your terror?


WHI. Yesh faith man, and it ish fot tat, we would be gone man.


IOH. O Gentlemen! did you not see a wife of mine? I have lost my little wife,
as I shall be trusted: my little pretty Win, I left her at the great woman's
house in trust yonder, the Pig-womans, with Captain Jordan, and Captain Whit,
very good men, and I cannot hear of her. Poor fool, I fear she is stepped
aside. Mother, did you not see Win?


IVS. If this grave Matron be your mother, Sir, stand by her, Et digito
compesc^ labellum, I may perhaps spring a wife for you, anon. Brother
Bartholmew, I am sadly sorry, to see you so lightly given, and such a Disciple
of enormity: with your grave Governor Humphrey: but stand you both there, in
the middle place; I will reprehend you in your course. Mistress Grace, let me
rescue you out of the hands of the stranger.


WIN-W. Pardon me, Sir, I am a kinsman of hers.


IVS. Are you so? of what name, Sir?


WIN-W. Winwife, Sir*


IVS. Master Winwife? I hope you have won no wife of her, Sir. If you have, I
will examine the possibility of it, at fit leisure. Now, to my enormities:
look upon me, O London! and see me, O Smithfield; The example of Justice,
and Mirror of Magistrates: the true top of formality, and scourge of enormity.
Harken unto my labors, and but observe my discoueries; and compare Hercules
with me, if thou dare, of old; or Columbus; Magellan; or our country man
Drake of later times: stand forth you weeds of enormity, and spread. First,
Rabbi Busy, thou superlunaticall hypocrite, next, To Busy, To Lantern, To the
horse courser, and Cutpurse. Then Cap. Whit, and Mistress Littlewit. thou
other extremity, thou profane professor of Puppetry, little better then
Poetry: then thou strong Debaucher, and Seducer of youth; witness this easy
and honest young man: now thou Esquire of Dames, Madams, and twelue-penny
Ladies: now my green Madame her self, of the price. Let me vnmasque your
Ladyship.


IOH. O my wife, my wife, my wife!


IVS. Is she your wife? Read te Harpocratem!


TRO. By your leave, stand by my Masters, be vncouer'd.


VRS. O stay him, stay him, help to cry, Nightingale; my pan, Enter
Trouble-all. my pan.


IVS. What Is the matter?


NIG. He has stolen gammar Vrsla's pan.


TRO. Yes, and I fear no man but Justice Ouerdoo.


IVS. Vrsla? where is she? O the Sow of enormity, this! To Vrsla, and
Nightingale. welcome, stand you there, you Songster, there.


VRS. An' please your worship, I am in no fault: A Gentleman stripped him in my
Booth, and borrowed his gown, and his hat; and he ran away with my goods,
here, for it.


IVS^ Then this is the true madman, and you are the enormity!


QVA. You are in the right, I am mad, To Quarlous. but from the gown outward.


IVS. Stand you there.


QVA. Where you please, Sir.


OVER O lend me a basin, I am sick, I am sick; Mistress Ouerdoo is sick:
and her husband is silenced. where is Mr. Ouerdoo? Bridget, call hither my Adam.


IVS. How?


WHI. Die very own wi^e, i'fait, worshipful Adam.


OVER. Will not my Adam come at me? shall I see him no more then?


QVA. Sir, why do you not go on with the enormity? are you oppressed with it?
I Will help you: hark you Sir, in your ear, your Innocent young man, you have
taken such care of, all this day, is a Cutpurse; that has got all your brother
Cokes his things, and helped you to your beating, and the stocks; if you have a
mind to hang him now, and show him your Magistrates wit, you may* but I should
think it were better, recovering the goods, and to save your estimation in him.
I thank you Sr. for the gift of your Ward, Mrs. Grace: look you, here is your
hand and seal, by the way. Mr. Win-wife give you joy, you are Palemon, you are
possessed of the Gentlewoman, but she must pay me value, here is warrant for it.
And honest madman, there is thy gown, and cap again; I thank thee for my
wife. Nay, I can be mad, sweet heart, when I please, still; never fear me: To
the widow. And careful Numps, where is he? I thank him for my license.


WAS. Waspe misseth the License. How!


QVA. It Is true, Numps.


WAS. I Will be hanged then.


QVA. Look in your box, Numps, nay, Sir, stand not you fixed here, like a stake
in Finsbury to be shot at, or the whipping post in the Fair, but get your wife
out of the air, it will make her worse else; and remember you are but Adam,
Flesh, and blood! you have your frailty, forget your other name of Ouerdoo, and
inuit us all to supper. There you and I will compare our discoueries; and
drown the memory of all enormity in your bigg'st bowl at home.


COK. How now, Numps, have you lost it? I warrant, 'twas when thou were in the
stocks: why do not speak?


WAS. I will never speak while I live, again, for ought I know.


IVS. Nay, Humphrey, if I be patient, you must be so too; this pleasant
conceited Gentleman has wrought upon my judgment, and prevailed: I pray you
take care of your sick friend, Mistress Alice, and my good friends all --


QVA. And no enormities.


IVS. I inuit you home, with me to my house, to supper: I will have none
fear to go along, for my intents are Ad correctionem, non ad destructionem; Ad
aedificandum, non ad diruendum: so lead on.


COK. Yes, and bring the Actors along, we will ha'the rest of the Play at home.


The end.
The EPILOGVE.
YOur Majesty has seen the Play, and you
can best allow it from your care, and view.
You know the scope of Writers, and what store,
of leave is given them, if they take not more,
And turn it into license: you can tell
if we have used that leave you gave us, well*
Or whether we to rage, or license break,
or be profane, or make profane men speak?
This is your power to judge (great Sir) and not
the envy of a few. Which if we have got,
We value less what their dislike can bring,
if it so happy be, to have pleased the King.

The Prologue.
THe DEVIL is an ASS. That is, to day,
The name of what you are met for, a new Play*
Yet Grandee's, would you were not come to grace
Our matter, with allowing us no place.
Though you presume SATAN a subtle thing,
And may have heard he is worn in a thumbe-ring;
Do not on these presumptions, force us act,
Incompasse of a cheese-trencher. This tract
Will never admit our vice, because of yours.
Anon, who, worse then you, the fault endures
That your selves make? when you will thrust and spurn,
And knock us of the elbowes, and hid, turn;
As if, when we had spoke, we must be gone,
Or, till we speak, must all run in, to one,
Like the young adders, at the old ones mouth?
Would we could stand due North; or had no South,
If that offend: or were Muscouy glass,
That you might look our Scenes through as they pass.
We know not how to affect you. If you will come
To see new Plays, pray you afford us room,
And show this, but the same face you have done
Your dear delight, the Devil of Edmunton.
Or, if, for want of room it must mis-carry,
'Twill be but Justice, that your censure tarry,
Till you give some. And when six times you have seen't,
If this Play do not like, the Devil is in it.
THE DEVIL IS AN ASS.
ACT. I. SCENE. I.
DEVIL. PVG. INIQVITY. HOh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, etc.
To earth? and why to earth, thou foolish Spirit?
What wold'st thou do on earth?

PVG. For that, great Chief!
As time shall work, I do but ask my mon'th.
Which every petty pui'nee Devil has;
Within that term, the Coutt of Hell will hear
Something, may gain a longer grant, perhaps.

SAT. For what? the laming a poor Cow, or two?
Entering a Sow, to make her cast her farrow?
Or crossing of a Mercat^womans Mare,
'Twixt this and Totnam? these were wont to be
Your maine atchieuements, Pug, you have some plot, now,
Upon a ronning of Ale, to stale the yest,
Or keep the churne so, that the butter come not;
Spite of the housewiues cord, or her hot spit?
Or some good Ribibe, about Kentish Town,
Or Hogsden, you would hang now, for a witch,
Because she will not let you play round Robbin:
And you will go sour the Cittiens Cream against Sunday?
That she may be accused for it, and condemned,
By a Middlesex Jury, to the satisfaction
Of their offended friends, the Londoners wives
Whose teeth were set on edge with it? Foolish feind,
Stay in your place, know your own strengths, and put not
Beyond the sphere of your actiuity.
You are too dull a Devil to be trusted
Forth in those parts, Pug, upon any affayre
That may concern our name, on earth. It is not
Every ones work. The state of Hell must care
Whom it imployes, in point of reputation,
Here about London. You would make, ^ think
An Agent, to be sent, for Lancashire,
Proper enough; or some parts of Northumberland,
So yo' had good instructions, Pug.

PVG. O Chief!
You do not know, dear Chief, what there is in me.
Prove me but for a fortnight, for a week,
And lend me but a Vice, to carry with me,
To practice therewith any play-fellow,
And, you will see, there will come more upon it,
Then you will imagine, precious Chief.

SAT. What Vice?
What kind would th'haue it of?

PVG. Why, any Fraud;
Or Covetousness; or Lady Vanity;
Or old Iniquity: I Will call him hither.

INI. What is he, calls upon me, and would seem to lack a Vice*
Ere his words be half spoken, I am with him in a trice;
Here, there, and every where, as the Cat is with the mice:
True vetus Iniquitas. Lack'st thou Cards, friend, or Dice?
I will teach thee cheat, Child, to cog, lie, and swagger,
And ever and anon, to be drawing forth thy dagger:
To swear by Gogs-nownes, like a lusty Inuentus,
In a cloak to thy heel, and a hat like a pent-house.
Thy breeches of three fingers, and thy doublet all belly,
With a Wench that shall feed thee, with cock-stones and gelly.

PVG. Is it not excellent, Chief? how nimble he is!


INI. Child of hell, this is nothing! I will fetch thee a leap
From the top of Pauls-steeple, to the Standard in Cheepe:
And lead thee a dance, through the streets without fail,
Like a needle of Spain, with a thread at my tail.
We will suruay the Suburbs, and make forth our sallyes,
Down Petticoate-lane, and up the Smock-allies,
To Shoreditch, Whitechappell, and so to Saint Kathernes.
To drink with the Dutch there, and take forth their patterns:
From thence, we will put in at Custom House key there,
And see, how the Factors, and Prentizes play there,
False with their Masters; and gueld many a full pack,
To spend it in pies, at the Dagger, and the Wool^sacke.

PVG. Brave, brave, Iniquity! will not this do, Chief?


INI. Nay* boy, I will bring thee to the Bawds, and the Roysters,
At Belins gate, feasting with claret wine, and oysters,
From thence shoot the Bridge, child, to the Cranes in the Vintry,
And see, there the gimblets, how they make their entry!
Or, if thou had rather, to the Strand down to ^all,
Against the Lawyers come dabled from Westminster Hall
And mark how they cling, with their clyents together,
Like Iuie to Oak; so Velvet to Leather:
Ha, boy, I would show thee.

PVG. Rare, rare!


DIV. Peace, dotard,
And thou more ignorant thing, that so admir'st.
Art thou the spirit thou seem? so poor? to choose
This, for a Vice, t'aduance the cause of Hell,
Now? as Vice stands this present year? Remember,
What number it is. Six hundred and sixteen.
Had it but been five hundred, though some sixty
Above; that is fifty years agone, and six,
(When every great man had his Vice stand by him,
In his long coat, shaking his wooden dagger)
I could consent, that, then this your grave choice
Might have done that, with his Lord Chief, the which
Most of his chamber can do now. But Pug,
As the times are, who is it, will receive you?
What company will you go to? or whom mix with?
Where can thou carry him? except to Tauernes?
To mount up on a joynt-stoole, with a Iewes-trumpe,
To put down Cokeley, and that must be to Citizens?
He never will be admitted, there, where Vennor comes.
He may perchance, in tail of a Sheriffs dinner,
Skip with a rhyme of the Table, from New-nothing,
And take his Almaine-leape into a custard,
Shall make my Lad Maioresse, and her sisters,
Laugh all their hoods over their shoulders. But,
This is not that will do, they are other things
That are received now upon earth, for Vices;
Stranger, and newer: and changed every hour.
They ride 'hem like their horses off their legs,
And here they come to Hell, whole legions of'hem,
Every week tired. We, still strive to breed,
And rear 'hem up new ones; but they do not stand,
When they come there: they turn 'hem on our hands.
And it is feared they have a stud o'their own
Will put down ours. Both our breed, and trade
Will suddenly decay, if we prevent not.
Unless it be a Vice of quality,
Or fashion, now, they take none from us. Car-men
Are got into the yellow starch, and Chimney-sweepers
To their tobacco, and strong water, Hum,
Mead, and Obarni. We must therefore aim
At extraordinary subtle ones, now,
When we do send to keep us up in credit.
Not old Iniquities. Get you e'ne back, Sir,
To making of your rope of sand again.
You are not for the manners, nor the times:
They have their Vices, there, most like to Virtues;
You cannnot know 'hem, apart, by any difference:
They wear the same clothes, eat the same meat*
Sleep in the selfsame beds, ride i'those coaches.
Or very like, four horses in a coach,
As the best men and women. Tissue gowns,
Garters and roses, fourscore pound a pair,
Embroydred stockings, cut-worke smocks, and shirts,
More certain marks of lechery, now, and pride,
Then ere they were of true nobility!
But Pug, since you do burn with such desire
To do the Commonwealth of Hell some service*
I am content, assuming of a body,
You go to earth, and visit men, a day.
But you must take a body ready made, Pug,
I can create you none: nor shall you form
Your self an aerie one, but become subject
To all impression of the flesh, you take,
So far as humane frailty. So, this morning,
There is a handsome Cutpurse hanged at Tiborne,
Whose spirit departed, you may enter his body:
For clothes employ your credit, with the Hangman,
Or let our tribe of Brokers furnish you.
And, look, how far your subtilty can work
Through those organs, with that body, spy
Amongst mankind, (you cannot there want vices,
And therefore the less need to carry 'hem wi'you)
But as you make your soon at nights relation,
And we shall find, it merits from the State,
You shall have both trust from us, and employment.

PVG. Most gracious Chief!


DIV. Only, thus more I bind you,
He shows Fitz-dottrel to him, coming forth. To serve the first man that you
meet; and him
I Will show you, now: Observe him. You' is he,
You shall see, first, after your clothing. Follow him:
But once engaged, there you must stay and fix;
Not shift, until the midnights cock do crow.

PVG. Any conditions to be gone.


DIV. Away, then.


ACT. I. SCENE. II.
FITZ-DOTTRELL. I, they do, now, name Bretnor, as before,
They talked of Gresham, and of Doctor Foreman,
Francklin, and Fiske, and Sauory (he was in too)
But there is not one of these, that ever could
Yet show a man the Devil, in true sort.
They have their christalls, I do know, and rings,
And virgin parchment, and their dead-mens ^culls
Their ravens wings, their lights, and pentacles,
With characters; I have seen all these. But --
Would I might see the Devil. I would give
A hundred o'these pictures, to see him
Once out of picture. May I prove a cuckold,
(And that is the one maine mortal thing I fear)
If I begin not, now, to think, the Painters
Have only made him. 'Slight, he would be seen,
One time or other else. He would not let
An ancient gentleman, of a good house,
As most are now in England, the Fitz-dottrel's,
Run wild, and call upon him thus in vain,
As I have done this twelve mone'th. If he be not,
At all, why, are there Coniurers? If they be not,
Why, are there laws against 'hem? The best artists
Of Cambridge, Oxford, Middlesex, and London,
Essex, and Kent, I have had in pay to raise him,
These fifty weeks, and yet h'appeares not. 'Sdeath,
I shall suspect, they, can make circles only
Shortly, and know but his hard names. They do say,
H'will meet a man (of himself) that has a mind to him.
If he would so, I have a mind and a half for him:
He should not be long absent. Pray thee, come
I long for thee. An' I were with child by him,
And my wife, too; I could not more. Come, yet, He expresses a longing to see
the Devil.

Good Beelezebub. Were he a kind devil,
And had humanity in him, he would come, but
To save ones longing. I should use him well,
I swear, and with respect (would he would try me)
Not, as the Conjurers do, when they have raised him.
Get him in bonds, and send him post, on errands.
A thousand miles, it is preposterous, that:
And I believe, is the true cause he comes not.
And he has reason. Who would be engaged,
That might live freely, as he may do? I swear,
They are wrong all. The burned child dreads the fire.
They do not know to entertain the Devil.
I would so welcome him, observe his diet,
Get him his chamber hung with arras, two of them,
IN my own house; lend him my wives wrought pillowes:
And as I am an honest man, I think,
If he had a mind to her, too; I should grant him,
To make our friend-ship perfect. So I would not
To every man. If he but hear me, now?
And should come to me in a brave young shape,
And take me at my word? ha! Who is this?

ACT. I. SCENE. IIJ.
PVG. FITZ-DOTTRELL. SIR, your good pardon, that I thus presume
Upon your priuacy. I am borne a Gentleman,
A younger brother; but, in some disgrace,
Now, with my friends: and want some little means,
To keep me upright, while things be reconciled.
Please you, to let my service be of use to you, Sir.

FIT. Service? before hell, my heart was at my mouth*
He looks and suruay's his feet: over and over. Till I had viewed his shoes
well: for, those roses
Were big enough to hide a cloven foot.
No, friend, my number's full. I have one servant,
Who is my all, indeed; and, from the broom
Unto the brush: for, just so far, I trust him.
He is my Wardrobe man, my Cater, Cook,
Butler, and Steward; looks unto my horse:
And helps to watch my wife. H'has all the places,
That I can think on, from the garret downward,
Even to the manger, and the curry-combe.

PVG. Sir, I shall put your worship to no charge,
More then my meat, and that but very little,
I Will serve you for your love.

FIT. Ha? without wages?
I Will harken o'that ear, were I at leisure.
But now, I Am busy. 'Pr'y the, friend forbear me,
And' thou had been a Devil, I should say
Somewhat more to thee. Thou do hinder, now,
My meditations.

PVG. Sir, I am a Devil.


FIT. How!


PVG. A true Devil, Sr.


FIT. Nay, now, you ly:
Under your favor, friend, for, I Will not quarrel.
I looked o'your feet, before, you cannot coozen me,
Your shoo's not cloven, Sir, you are whole hoof'd. He viewes his feet again.

PVG. Sir, that is a popular error, deceiues many:
But I am that, I tell you.

FIT. What Is your name?


PVG. My name is Devil, Sr.


FIT. Sai'st thou true.


PVG. Indeed, Sr.


FIT. 'Slid! there is some omen i'this! what countryman?


PVG. Of Derby-shire, Sr. about the Peake.


FIT. That Hole
Belonged to your Ancestors?

PVG. Yes, Devils arse, Sr.


FIT. I Will entertain him for the name sake. Ha?
And turn away my the other man? and save
Four pound a year by that? there is luck, and thrift too!
The very Devil may come, hereafter, as well.
Friend, I receive you: but (withal) I acquaint you,
Aforehand, if yo' offend me, I must beat you.
It is a kind of exercise, I use.
And cannot be without.

PVG. Yes, if I do not
Offend, you can, sure.

FIT. Faith, Devil, very hardly:
I Will call you by your surname, 'cause I love it.

ACT. I. SCENE. IIII.
INGINE. VVITTIPOL. MANLY. FITZDOTTRELL. PVG. YOnder he walks, Sir, I Will go
lift him for you.


WIT. To him, good Ingine, raise him up by degrees,
Gently, and hold him there too, you can do it.
Show your self now, a Mathematical broker.

ING. I Will warrant you for half a piece.


WIT. It Is done, Sr.


MAN. Is It possible there should be such a man?


WIT. You shall be your own witness, I Will not labor
To tempt you past your faith.

MAN. And is his wife
So very handsome, say you?

WIT. I have not seen her,
Since I came home from travel: and they say,
She is not altered. Then, before I went,
I saw her once; but so, as she has stuck
Still i'my view, no object has removed her.

MAN. It Is a fair guest, Friend, beauty: and once lodged
Deep in the eyes, she hardly leaves the Inn.
How does he keep her?

WIT. Very brave. Howeuer,
Himself be sordide, he is sensual that way.
In every dressing, he does study her.

MAN. And furnish forth himself so from the Brokers?


WIT. Yes, that is a hyr'd suite, he now has one,
To see the Devil is an Ass, to day, in*
(This Ingine gets three or four pound a week by him)
He dares not miss a new Play, or a Feast,
What rate soever clothes be at; and thinks
Himself still new, in other men's old.

MAN. But stay,
Does he love meat so?

WIT. Faith he does not hate it.
But that is not it. His belly and his palate
Would be compounded with for reason. Mary,
A wit he has, of that strange credit with him,
Against all mankind; as it does make him do
Just what it list: it rauishes him forth,
Whither it please, to any assembly'or place,
And would conclude him ruined, should he escape
One public meeting, out of the belief
Ingine has won Fitzdo^trel, to 'say on the cloak.
He has of his own great, and Catholic strengths,
In arguing, and discourse. It takes, I see:
^'has got the cloak upon him.

FIT. A fair garment,
By my faith, Ingine!

ING. It was never made, Sir,
For three score pound, I assure you: 'Twill yield thirty.
The plush, Sir, cost three pound, ten shillings a yard!
And then the lace, and velvet.

FIT. I shall, Ingine,
Be looked at, pretitly, in it! Art thou sure
The Play is played to day?

ING. o here is the bill, Sr.
He gives him the Play-bill. IN, had forgot to gi't you.

FIT. Ha? the Devil!
I will not lose you, Sirah! But, Ingine, think you,
The Gallant is so furious in his folly?
So mad upon the matter, that he will part
With His cloak vpo'these terms?

ING. Trust not your Ingine,
Break me to pieces else, as you would do
A rotten Crane, or an old rusty Jack,
That has not one true wheel in him. Do but talk with him.

FIT. I shall do that, to satisfy you, Ingine,
And my self too. With your leave, Gentlemen.
He turns to Wittipol. Which of you is it, is so mere Idolater
To my wives beauty, and so very prodigal
Unto my patience, that, for the short parlee?
Of one swift hours quarter, with my wife,
He will depart with (let me see) this cloak here
The price of folly? Sir, are you the man?

WIT. I am that vent'rer, Sir.


FIT. Good time! your name
Is Witty-pol?

WIT. The same, Sr.


FIT. And it is told me,
Yo' have trauell'd lately?

WIT. That I have, Sr.


FIT. Truly,
Your trauells may have altered your complexion;
But sure, your wit stood still.

WIT. It may well be, Sir.
All heads have not like growth.

FIT. The good man's gravity,
That left you land, your father, never taught you
These pleasant matches?

WIT. No, nor can his mirth,
With whom I make 'hem, put me off.

FIT. You are
Resolved then?

WIT. Yes, Sr.


FIT. Beauty is the Saint,
You Will sacrifice your self, into the shirt too?

WIT. So I may still cloth, and keep warm your wisdom?


FIT. You lade me Sr!


WIT. I know what you will bear, Sr.


FIT. Well, to the point. It Is only, Sir, you say,
To speak unto my wife?

WIT. Only, to speak to her.


FIT. And in my presence?


WIT. In your very presence.


FIT. And in my hearing?


WIT. In your hearing: so,
You interrupt us not.

FIT. For the short space
You do demand, the fourth part of an hour,
I think I shall, with some convenient study, He shrugs himself up in the
cloak.
And this good help to boot, bring my self to it.

WIT. I ask no more.


FIT. Please you, walk to'ard my house,
Speak what you list; that time is yours: My right
I have departed with. But, not beyond,
A minute, or a second, look for. Length,
And drawing out, ma'aduance much, to these matches.
And I except all kissing. Kisses are
Silent petitions still with willing Lovers.

WIT. Lovers? How falls that o'your phantsie?


FIT. Sir.
I do know somewhat, I forbid all lip-worke.

WIT. I am not eager at forbidden dainties.
Who couets unfit things, denies him self.

FIT. You say well, Sir, 'Twas prettily said, that same,
He does, indeed. I Will have no touches, therefore,
Nor takings by the arms, nor tender circles
Cast 'bout the wast, but all be done at distance.
Love is brought up with those soft migniard handlings;
His pulse lies in his palm: and I defend
All melting joints, and fingers, (that is my bargain)
I do defend 'hem; any thing like action.
But talk, Sir, what you will. Use all the Tropes
And Schemes, that Prince Quintilian can afford you:
And much good do your Rhetoriques heart. You are welcome, Sir.
Ingine, God b'w'you.

WIT. Sir, I must condition
To have this Gentleman by, a witness.

FIT. Well,
I am content, so he be silent.

MAN. Yes, Sir.


FIT. Come Devil, I Will make you room, straight. But I Will show you
First, to your Mistress, who is no common one,
You must conceive, that brings this gain to see her.
I hope thou'st brought me good luck.

PVG. I shall do it. Sir.


ACT. I. SCENE. V.
VVITTIPOL. MANLY. INgine, you hope o'your half piece? It Is there, Sir.

Wittipol knocks his friend of the breast. Be gone. Friend Manly, who is within
here? fixed?


MAN. I am directly in a fit of wonder

What'll be the issue of this conference!


WIT. For that, never vex your self, till the event.

How like yo'him?


MAN. I would feign see more of him.


WIT. What think you of this?


MAN. I am past degrees of thinking.

Old Africa, and the new America,

With all their fruit of Monsters cannot show

So just a prodigy.


WIT. Could you have believed,

Without your sight, a mind so sordide inward,

Should be so specious, and laid forth abroad,

To all the show, that ever shop, or ware was?


MAN. I believe any thing now, though I confess

His Vices are the most extremities

I ever knew in nature. But, why loves he

The Devil so?


WIT. O Sr! for hidden treasure,

He hopes to find: and has proposed himself

So infinite a Mass, as to recover,

He cares not what he parts with, of the present,

To his men of Art, who are the race, may coin him.

Promise gold-mountaines, and the covetous

Are still most prodigal.


MAN. But have you faith,

That he will hold his bargain?


WIT. O dear, Sir!

He will not off on it. Fear him not. I know him*

One baseness still accompanies another.

See! he is here already, and his wife too.


MAN. A wondrous handsome creature, as I live!


ACT. I. SCENE. VI.
FITZ-DOTTRELL. Mistress FITZ-DOTTREL. WITTIPOL. MANLY. COme wife, this is the
Gentleman. Nay, blush not.


Mrs. FI. Why, what do you mean Sir? ha'you your reason?


FIT. Wife,
I do not know, that I have lent it forth
To any one; at least, without a pawn, wife:
Or that I'haue eat or drunk the thing, of late,
That should corrupt it. Wherefore gentle wife,
Obey, it is thy virtue: hold no acts
Of disputation.

Mrs. FI. Are you not enough
The talk, of feasts, and meetingy, but you will still
Make argument for fresh?

FIT. Why, careful wedlock,
If I have have a longing to have one tale more
Go of me, what is that to thee, dear heart?
Why should thou envy my delight? or cross it?
By being solicitous, when it not concerns thee?

Mrs. FI. Yes, I have share in this The scorn will fall
As bittterly on me, where both are laughed at.

FIT. Laughed at, sweet bird? is that the scruple? Come, come,
Thou art a Niaise. Which of your great houses,
(I will not mean at home, here, A Niaise is a young Hawke, taken crying out of
the nest.
but abroad)
Your families in France, wife, send not forth
Something, within the seven year, may be laughed at?
I do not say seven months, nor seven weeks,
Nor seven days, nor hours: but seven year wife.
I give 'hem time. Once, within seven year,
I think they may do something may be laughed at.
In France, I keep me there, still. Wherefore, wife,
Let them that list, laugh still, rather then weep
For me; Here is a cloak cost fifty pound, wife,
Which I can sell for thirty, when I have seen
All London in it, and London has seen me.
To day, I go to the Black friars Playhouse,
Sit ithe view, salute all my acquaintance,
Rise up between the Acts, let fall my cloak,
Publish a handsome man, and a rich suite
(As that is a special end, why we go thither,
All that pretend, to stand for it of the Stage)
The Ladies ask who is that? (For, they do come
To see us, Love, as we do to see them)
Now, I shall lose all this, for the false fear
Of being laughed at? Yes, wusse. Let 'hem laugh, wife,
Let me have such another cloak to morrow.
And let 'hem laugh again, wife, and again,
And then grow fat with laughing, and then fatter,
All my young Gallants, let 'hem bring their friends too:
Shall I forbid 'hem? No, let heaven forbid 'hem:
Or wit, if it have any charge on 'hem. Come, thy eat, wife,
Is all, I Will borrow of thee. Set your watch, Sir,
Thou, only art to hear, not speak a word, Dove,
To ought he says. That I do gi'you in precept,
No less then council, on your wiue-hood, wife,
Not though he flatter you, or make court, or Love,
(As you must look for these) or say, he rail;
What ere his arts be, wife, I will have thee
Delude 'hem with a trick, thy obstinate silence;
I know advantages; and I love to hit
These pragmaticke young men, at their own weapons.
He disposes his wife to his place, and sets his watch. Is your watch ready?
Here my sail bears, for you*
Tack toward him, sweet Pinnace, where is your watch?

WIT. I Will set it, Sir, with yours.


Mrs. FI. I must obey.


MAN. Her modesty seems to suffer with her beauty,
And so, as if his folly were away,
It were worth pity.

FIT. Now, th'a^e right, begin, Sir.
But first, let me repeat the contract, briefly.
I am, Sir, to enjoy this cloak, I stand in,
Freely, and as your gift; upon condition
He repeats his contract again.
You may as freely, speak here to my spouse,
Your quarter of an hour always keeping
The measured distance of your yard, or more,
From my said Spouse: and in my sight and hearing.
This is your covenant?

WIT. Yes, but you will allow
For this time spent, now?

FIT. Set 'hem so much back.


WIT. I think, I shall not need it.


FIT. Well, begin, Sir,
There is your bound, Sir. Not beyond that rush.

WIT. If you interrupt me, Sir, I shall discloake you.
Wittipol begins.
The time I have purchased, Lady, is but short;
And, therefore, if I employ it thriftily,
I hope I stand the nearer to my pardon.
I am not here, to tell you, you are fair,
Or lovely, or how well you dress you, Lady,
I Will save my self that eloquence of your glass,
Which can speak these things better to you then I.
And it is a knowledge, wherein fools may be
As wise as a Court Parliament. Nor come I,
With any prejudice, or doubt, that you
Should, to the notice of your own worth, need
Least revelation. She Is a simple woman,
Know's not her good: (who ever knows her ill)
And at all caracts. That you are the wife,
To so much blasted flesh, as scarce has soul,
In stead of salt, to keep it sweet; I think,
Will ask no witnesses, to prove. The cold
Sheets that you lie in, with the watching candle,
That sees, how dull to any thaw of beauty,
Pieces, and quarters, half, and whole nights, sometimes,
The Diuell-giuen Elfine Squire, your husband,
Does leave you, quitting here his proper circle,
For a much-worse in the walks of Lincolnes Inn,
Under the Elmes, t'expect the feind in vain, there
Will confess for you.

FIT. I did look for this geere.


WIT. And what a daughter of darkness, he does make you,
Locked up from all society, or object;
Your eye not let to look upon a face,
Under a Conjurers (or some mould for one,
Hollow, and lean like his) but, by great means,
As I now make; your own too sensible sufferings,
Without the extraordinary aids,
Of spells, or spirits, may assure you, Lady.
For my part, I protest against all such practice,
I work by no false arts, medicines, or charms
To be said forward and backward.

FIT. No, I except:

WIT. Sir I shall ease you.


FIT. Mum.


WIT. Nor have I ends, Lady, He offers to discloake him.
Upon you, more then this: to tell you how Love
Beauties good Angel, he that waits upon her
At all occasions, and no less then Fortune,
Helps th'aduenturous, in me makes that proffer,
Which never fair one was so fond, to lose;
Who could but reach a hand forth to her freedom.
On the first sight, I loved you: since which time,
Though I have trauell'd, I have been in travel
More for this second blessing of your eyes
Which now IN have purchased, then for all aims else.
Think of it, Lady, be your mind as active,
As is your beauty: view your object well.
Examine both my fashion, and my years
Things, that are like, are soon familiar:
And Nature joys, still in equality.
Let not the sign of the husband fright you, Lady.
But ere your spring be gone, enjoy it. Flowers,
Though fair, are often but of one morning. Think,
All beauty does not last until the autumn.
You grow old, while I tell you this. And such,
As cannot use the present, are not wise.
If Love and Fortune will take care of us,
Why ^should our will be wanting? This is all.
Wha do you answer, Lady?

FIT. Now, the sport comes.
She stands mute. Let him still wait, wait, wait: while the watch goes,
And the time runs. Wife!

WIT. How! not any word?
Nay, then, I taste a trick in it. Worthy Lady,
I cannot be so false to mine own thoughts
Of your presumed goodness, to conceive
This, as your rudeness, which I see's imposed.
Yet, since your cautelous Iaylor, here stands by you,
And yo'are denied the liberty of the house,
Let me take warrant, Lady, from your silence,
(Which ever is interpreted consent)
To make your answer for you: which shall be
To as good purpose, as I can imagine,
And what I think you would speak.

FIT. No, no, no, no.


WIT. He sets Mr. Manly, his friend in her place. I shall resume, Sr.


MAN. Sir, what do you mean?


WIT. One interruption more, Sir, and you go
Into your hose and doublet, nothing saues you.
And therefore harken. This is for your wife.

MAN. You mus^ play fair, Sr.


WIT. Stand for me, good friend.
Troth, Sir, it is more then true, that you have vttred
And speaks for her. Of my unequal, and so sordide match here,
With all the circumstances of my bondage.
I have a husband, and a two-legg'd one,
But such a moon-ling, as no wit of man
Or roses can redeem from being an Ass.
H'is grown too much, the story of men's mouths,
To escape his lading: should I make it my study,
And lay all ways, yea, call mankind to help,
To take his burden off, why, this one act
Of his, to let his wife out to be courted,
And, at a price, proclaims his asinine nature
So loud, as I am weary of my title to him.
But Sir, you seem a Gentleman of virtue,
No less then blood; and one that every way
Looks as he were of too good quality,
To entrap a credulous woman, or betray her:
Since you have paid thus dear, Sir, for a visit,
And made such venture, on your wit, and charge
Merely to see me, or at most to speak to me,
I were too stupid; or (what is worse) ingrate
Not to return your venture. Think, but how,
I may with safety do it; I shall trust
My love and honor to you, and presume*
You Will ever husband both, against this husband;
Who, if we chance to change his liberal ears,
To other ensigns, and with labor make
A new beast of him, as he shall deserve,
Cannot complain, he is unkindly dealth with.
This day he is to go to a new play, Sir.
From whence no fear, no, nor authority,
Scarcely the Kings command, Sir, will restrain him,
Now you have fitted him with a Stage-garment,
For the mere names sake, were there nothing else:
And many more such iourneyes, he will make.
Whieh, if they now, or, any time hereafter,
Offer us opportunity, you hear, Sir,
Who Will be as glad, and forward to embrace, He shifts to his own place again
Meet, and enjoy it chearefully as you.
I humbly thank you, Lady.

FIT. Keep your ground Sir.


WIT. Will you be lightened?


FIT. Mum.


WIT. And but I am,
By the sad contract, thus to take my leave of you
At this so envious distance, I had taught
Our lips ere this, to seal the happy mixture
Made of our souls. But we must both, now, yield
To the necessity. Do not think yet, Lady,
But I can kiss, and touch, and laugh, and whisper,
And do those crowning court-ships too, for which
Day, and the public have allowed no name
But, now, my bargain binds me. 'Twere rude injury,
T'importune more, or urge a noble nature,
To what of it is own bounty it is prone to:
Else, I should speak -- But, Lady, I love so well,
As I will hope, you will do so to. I have done, Sir.

FIT. Well, then, I ha'won?


WIT. Sir, And I may win, too.


FIT. O yes! no doubt on it. I Will take careful order,
That she shall hang forth ensigns at the window,
To tell you when I am absent. Or I Will keep
Three or four foote-men, ready still of purpose,
To run and fetch you, at her longings, Sir.
I Will go bespeake me straight a guilt caroch,
For her and you to take the air in. Yes,
Into Hide-parke, and thence into Blackfriars,
Visit the painters, where you may see pictures,
And note the properest limbs, and how to make 'hem.
Or what do you say unto a middling Gossip?
To bring you aye together, at her lodging?
Under pretext of teaching of my wife
Some rare receipt of drawing almond milk? ha?
It shall be a part of my care. Good Sir, God b'w'you.
I have kept the contract, and the cloak is mine.

WIT. Why, much good do it you Sr; it may fall out,
That you have bought it dear, though I have not sold it.

FIT. A pretty riddle! Fare you well, good Sir.
He turns his wife about. W^^e, your face this way, look on me: and think
Yo'haue had a wicked dream, wife, and forget it.

MAN. This is the strangest motion I ere saw.


FIT. Now, wife, sits this fair cloak the worse upon me,
For my great sufferings, or your little patience? ha?
They laugh, you think?

Mrs. FI. Why Sr. and you might see it.
What thought, they have of you, may be soon collected
By the young Genlemans speech.

FIT. Young Gentleman?
Death! you are in love with him, are you? could he not
Be named the Gentleman, without the young?
Up to your Cabin again.

Mrs. FI My cage, yo' were best
To call it?

FIT. Yes, sing there. You Would feign be making
Blanck Manger with him at your mothers! I know you.
Go get you up. How now! what say you, Devil?

ACT. I. SCENE. VII.
PVG. FITZDOTTREL. INGINE. Here is one Ingine, Sir, desires to speak with you.


FIT. I thought he brought some news, of a broker! Well,
Let him come in, good Devil: fetch him else.
O, my fine Ingine! what is th'affaire? more cheats?

ING. No Sir, the Wit, the Brain, the great Proiector,
I told you of, is newly come to town.

FIT. Where, Ingine?


ING. I ha'brought him (H'is without)
Ere he pulled off his boots, Sir, but so followed,
For businesses:

FIT. But what is a Proiector?
I would conceive.

ING. Why, one Sir, that proiects
Ways to enrich men, or to make 'hem great,
By suites, by marriages, by undertakings:
According as he sees they humor it.

FIT. Can he not conjure at all?


ING. I think he can, Sir.
(To tell you true) but, you do know, of late,
The State has taken such note of 'hem, and compelled 'hem,
To enter such great bonds, they dare not practice.

FIT. It Is true, and I lie fallow for it, the while!


ING. O, Sir! you will grow the richer for the rest.


FIT. I hope I shall: but Ingine, you do talk
Somewhat too much, of my courses. My Cloake-customer
Could tell me strange particulars.

ING. By my means?


FIT. How should he haue'hem else?


ING. You do not know, Sr,
What he has: and by what arts! A monei'd man, Sir,
And is as great with your Almanack-Men, as you are!

FIT. That Gallant?


ING. You make the other wait too long, here:
And he is extreme punctual.

FIT. Is he a gallant?


ING. Sir, you shall see: He'is in his riding suit,
As he comes now from Court. But here him speak:
Minister matter to him, and then tell me.

ACT. IJ. SCENE. I.
MEER-CRAFT. FITZ-DOTTREL. INGINE. TRAINS. PVG. SIr, money's a whore, a bawd,
a drudge;
Fit to run out on errands: Let her go.
Via pecunia! when she is run and gone,
And fled and dead; then will I fetch her, again,
With Aqua-vitae, out of an old Hogs-head!
While there are lees of wine, or dregs of beer,
I Will never want her! Coin her out of cobwebs,
Dust, but I Will have her! Raise wool upon egge-shells,
Sir, and make grass grow out of marro-bones.
To make her come. (Commend me to your Mistress,
Say, let the thousand pound but be had ready, To a waiter.
And it is done) I would but see the creature
(Of flesh, and blood) the man, the prince, indeed,
That could employ so many millions
As I would help him to.

FIT. How, talks he? millions?


MER. (I Will give you an account of this to morrow.)
Yes, I will talk no less, and do it too; To another.
If they were Myriades: and without the Devil,
By direct means, it shall be good in law.

ING. Sir.


MER. To a third. Tell Mr. Wood cock, I Will not fail to meet him
Upon the Exchange at night. Pray him to have
The writings there, and we will dispatch it. Sir,
You are a Gentleman of a good presence,
He turns to Fitz-dottrel. A handsome man (I have considered you)
As a fit stock to graft honors upon:
I have a project to make you a Duke, now.
That you must be one, within so many months,
As I set down, out of true reason of state,
You sha' not avoid it. But you must harken, then.

ING. Harken? why Sr, do you doubt his ears? Alas!
You do not know Master Fitz-dottrel.

FIT. He does not know me indeed. I thank you, Ingine,
He turns to Ingine. For rectifying him.

MER. Good! Why, Ingine, then
I Will tell it you. (I see you have credit, here,
And, that you can keep counsel, I Will not question.)
He shall but be an undertaker with me,
In a most feasible business. It shall cost him
Nothing.

ING. Good, Sr.


MER* Except he please, but's countenance;
(That I will have) t'appeare in it, to great men,
For which I Will make him one. He shall not draw
A string of's purse. I Will drive his pattent for him.
We'll take in Citizens, Commoners, and Aldermen,
To bear the charge, and blow 'hem off again,
Like so many dead flies, when it is carried.
The thing is for recovery of drowned land,
Whereof the Crowne's to have his moiety,
If it be owner; Else, the Crown and Owners
To share that moiety: and the recouerers
T'enioy the the other moiety, for their charge.

ING. Thorowout England?


MER. Yes, which will arise
To eyghteene millions, seven the first year:
I have computed all, and made my suruay
Unto an acre. I Will begin at the Pan,
Not, at the skirts: as some have done, and lost,
All that they wrought, their timber-worke, their trench,
Their banks all borne away, or else filled up
By the next winter. Tut, they never went
The way: I Will have it all.

ING. A gallant tract
Of land it is!

MER. 'Twill yield a pound an acre.
We must let cheap, ever, at first. But Sir,
This looks too large for you, I see. Come hither,
We'll have a less. Here Is a plain fellow, you see him,
Has his black bag of papers, there, in Buckram,
Wi'not be sold for th'Earledome of Pancridge: Draw,
Gi'me out one, by chance. Project. 4. Dog-skinnes?
Twelve thousand pound! the very worst, at first.

FIT. Pray you let us see it Sir.


MER. It Is a toy, a trifle!


FIT. Trifle! 12. thousand pound for dogs-skins?


MER. Yes,
But, by my way of dressing, you must know, Sir,
And med'cining the leather, to a height
Of improu'd ware, like your Borachio
Of Spain, Sir. I can fetch nine thousand for it --

ING. Of the Kings glouer?


MER. Yes, how heard you that?


ING. Sir, I do know you can.


MER. Within this hour:
And reserve half my secret. Pluck another;
See if thou have a happier hand: I thought so. He pluckes out the 2.
Bottle-ale.
The very next worse to it! Bottle-ale.
Yet, this is two and twenty thousand! Pr'y thee
Pull out another, two or three.

FIT. Good, stay, friend,
By bottle-ale, two and twenty thousand pound?

MER. Yes, Sir, it is cast to penny-hal'penny-farthing,
Of The backside, there you may see it, read,
I will not bate a Harrington of the sum.
I Will win it i'my water, and my malt,
My furnaces, and hanging of my coppers,
The tonning, and the subtilty of my yest;
And, then the earth of my bottles, which I dig,
Turn up, and steep, and work, and neale, my self,
To a degree of Porc'lane. You will wonder,
At my proportions, what I will put up
In seven years! for so long time, I ask
For my invention. I will save in cork,
In my mere stop'ling, above three thousand pound,
Within that term: by googing of 'hem out
Just to the size of my bottles, and not slicing.
There Is infinite loss i'that. What have thou there? He draws out another.
Raisines.
O'making wine of raisins: this is in hand, now,

ING. Is not that strange, Sr, to make wine of raisins?


MER. Yes, and as true a wine, as th'wines of France,
Or Spain, or Italy, Look of what grape
My raisin is, that wine I Will render perfect,
As of the muscatell grape, I Will render muscatell;
Of the Canary, his; the Claret, his;
So of all kinds: and bate you of the prices,
Of wine, throughout the kingdom, half in half.

ING. But, how, Sr, if you raise the other commodity,
Raysin^s?

MER. Why, then I Will make it out of black-berries:
And it shall do the same. It Is but more art,
And the charge less. Take out another.

FIT. No, good Sir.
Save you the trouble, I Will not look, nor hear
Of any, but your first, there; the Drown'd-land:
If It will do, as you say.

MER. Sir, there is not place,
To gi'you demonstration of these things.
They are a little to subtle. But, I could show you
Such a necessity in it, as you must be
But what you please: against the received heresy,
That England bears no Dukes. Keep you the land, Sr,
The greatness of the estate shall throw't upon you.
If you like better turning it to money,
What may not you, Sr, purchase with that wealth?
Say, you should part with two o'your millions,
To be the thing you would, who would not do it?
As I protest, I will, out of my diuident,
Lay, for some pretty principality,
In Italy, from the Church* Now, you perhaps,
Fancy the smoke of England, rather? But --
Have you no private room, Sir, to draw to,
T'enlarge our selves more upon.

FIT. O yes, Devil!


MER. These, Sir, are bus'nesses, ask to be carried
With caution, and in cloud.

FIT. I apprehend,
They do so, Sr. Devil, which way is your Mistress?

PVG. Above, Sr. in her chamber.


FIT. O that is well.
Then, this way, good, Sir.

MER. I shall follow you; Trains,
Gi'mee the bag, and go you presently,
Commend my service to my Lady Tail-bush.
Tell her I am come from Court this morning; say,
IN have got our business moved, and well: Entreat her,
That she give you the four-score Angels, and see 'hem
Disposed of to my Council, Sir Poul Eytherside.
Sometime, to day, I Will wait upon her Ladyship,
With the relation.

ING. Sir, of what dispatch,
He is! Do you mark?

MER. Ingine, when did you see
My cousin Euer-ill? keeps he still your quarter?
In The Bermudas?

ING. Yes, Sir, he was writing
This morning, very hard.

MER. Be not you known to him,
That I am come to Town: I have effected
A business for him, but I would have it take him,
Before he thinks for it.

ING. Is it past?


MER. Not yet.
It Is well of the way.

ING. O Sir! your worship takes
Infinite pains.

MER. I love Friends, to be active:
A sluggish nature puts off man, and kind.

ING. And such a blessing follows it^

MER. I thank
My fate. Pray you let us be private, Sir?

FIT. In, here.


MER. Where none may interrupt us.


FIT. You hear, Devil,
Lock the streete-doores fast, and let no one in
(Except they be this Gentleman's followers)
To trouble me. Do you mark? Yo'haue heard and seen
Something, to day; and, by it, you may gather
Your Mistress is a fruit, that is worth the stealing
And therefore worth the watching. Be you sure, now,
Yo' have all your eyes about you; and let in
No lace-woman; nor bawd, that brings French-masques,
And cut-works. See you? Nor old croanes, with wafers,
To convey letters. Nor no youths, disguised
Like country-wiues, with cream, and marrow-puddings.
Much knavery may be vented in a pudding,
Much bawdy intelligence: They'are shrewd ciphers.
Nor turn the key to any neighbors need;
Be It but to kindle fire, or beg a little,
Put it out, rather: all out, to an ash,
That they may see no smoke. Or water, spill it:
Knock of the empty tubs, that by the sound,
They may be forbid entry. Say, we are robbed,
If any come to borrow a spoone, or so.
I wi' not have good fortune, or gods blessing
Let in, while I am busy.

PVG. I Will take care, Sir:
They sha' not trouble you, if they would.

FIT. Well, do so.


ACT. II. SCENE. II.
PVG. Mistress FITZDOTTRELL. I have no singular service of this, now?
Nor no superlatiue Master? I shall wish
To be in hell again, at leisure? Bring,
A Vice from thence? That had bin such a subtilty,
As to bring broad-clothes hither: or transport
Fresh oranges into Spain. I find it, now;
My Chief was in the right. Can any feind
Boast of a better Vice, then here by nature,
And art, they are owners of? Hell never own me,
But I am taken! the fine tract of it
Pulls me along! To hear men such professors
Grown in our subtlest Sciences! My first Act, now,
Shall be, to make this Master of mine cuckold:
The primitive work of darkness, I will practice!
I will deserve so well of my fair Mistress,
By my discoueries, first; my counsels after;
And keeping counsel, after that: as who,
So ever, is one, I Will be another, sure,
I Will have my share. Most delicate damned flesh!
She will be! O! that I could stay time, now,
Midnight will come too fast upon me, I fear,
She sends Devil out. To cut my pleasure --

Mrs. FI. Look at the back-doore,
One knocks, see who it is.

PVG. Dainty she-Diuell!


Mrs. FI. I cannot get this venture of the cloak,
Out of my fancy; nor the Gentleman's way,
He took, which though 'twere strange, yet 'twas handsome,
And had a grace withal, beyond the newness.
Sure he will think me that dull stupid cre^ture,
He said, and may conclude it; if I find not
Some thought to thank th'attemp. He did presume,
By all the carriage of it, on my brain,
For answer; and will swear it is very barren,
Devil returns. If it can yield him no return Who is it?

PVG. Mistress, it is, but first, let me assure
The excellence, of Mistresses, I am,
Although my Masters man, my Mistress slave,
The servant of her secrets, and sweet turns,
And know, what fitly will conduce to either.

Mrs. FI. What Is this? I pray you come to your self and think
What your part is: to make an answer. Tell,
Who is it at the door?

PVG. The Gentleman, Mrs,
Who was at the cloake-charge to speak with you,
This morning, who expects only to take
Some small command'ments from you, what you please,
Worthy your form, he says, and gentlest manners.

Mrs. FI. O! you will anon prove his hyr'd man, I fear,
What has he given you, for this message? Sir,
Bid him put off his hopes of straw, and leave
To spread his nets, in view, thus. Though they take
Master Fitz-dottrel, I am no such foul,
Nor fair one, tell him, will be had with stalking.
And wish him to for-beare his acting to me,
At the Gentleman's chamber-window in Lincolnes-Inne there,
That opens to my gallery: else, I swear
T'acquaint my husband with his folly, and leave him
To the just rage of his offended jealousy.
Or if your Masters sense be not so quick
To right me, tell him, I shall find a friend
That will repair me. Say, I will be quiet.
In mine own house? Pray you, in those words give it him.

PVG. He goes out. This is some fool turned!


Mrs. FI. If he be the Master,
Now, of that state and wit, which I allow him;
Sure, he will understand me: I durst not
Be more direct. For this officious fellow,
My husbands new groom, is a spy upon me,
I find already. Yet, if he but tell him
This in my words, he cannot but conceive
Himself both apprehended, and requited.
I would not have him think he met a statue:
Or spoke to one, not there, though I were silent.
How now? have you told him?

PVG. Yes.


Mrs. FI. And what says he?


PVG. Says he? That which my self would say to you, if I durst.
That you are proud, sweet Mistress? and with-all,
A little ignorant, to entertain
The good that is proffered; and (by your beauties leave)
Not all so wise, as some true politic wife
Would be: who having matched with such a Nupson
(I speak it with my Masters peace) whose face
Has left t'accuse him, now, for it does confess him,
What you can make him; will yet (out of scruple,
And a spic'd conscience) defraud the poor Gentleman,
At least delay him in the thing he longs for,
And makes it hs whole study, how to compass,
Only a title. Could but he write Cuckold,
He had his ends. For, look you --

Mrs. FI. This can be
None but my husbands wit.

PVG. My precious Mrs.


M. FI. It creaks his Ingine: The groom never durst
Be, else, so saucy --

PVG. If it were not clearly,
His worshipful ambition; and the top of it;
The very forked top too: why should he
Keep you, thus mur'd up in a back-roome, Mistress,
Allow you never a casement to the street,
Fear of engendering by the eyes, with gallants,
Forbid you paper, pen and ink, like Rats-bane.
Search your half pint of muscatell, lest a letter
Be suncke in the pot: and hold your new-laid egg
Against the fire, lest any charm be writ there?
Will you make benefit of truth, dear Mistress,
If I do tell it you: I do it not often?
I am set over you, employed, indeed,
To watch your steps, your looks, your very breathings,
And to report them to him. Now, if you
Will be a true, right, delicate sweet Mistress,
Why, we will make a Cokes of this Wise Master,
We will, my Mistress, an absolute fine Cokes,
And mock, to air, all the deep diligences
Of such a solemn, and effectual Ass,
An Ass to so good purpose, as we will use him.
I will contriue it so, that you shall go
To Plays, to Masks, to Meetings, and to Feasts.
For, why is all this Rigging, and fine Tackle, Mistress,
If you neat handsome vessels, of good sail,
Put not forth ever, and anon, with your nets
Abroad into the world. It is your fishing.
I here, you shall choose your friends, your servants, Lady,
Your squires of honor; I Will convey your letters,
Fetch answers, do you all the offices,
That can belong to your blood, and beauty. And,
For the variety, at my times, although
I am not in due symmetrie, the man
Of that proportion; or in rule
Of physic, of the just complexion;
Or of that truth of Picardill, in clothes,
To boast a sovereignty over Ladies: yet
I know, to do my turns, sweet Mistress. Come, kiss --

Mrs. FI. How now!


PVG. Dear delicate Mist. I am your slave,
Your little worm, that loves you: your fine Monkey;
Your Dog, your Jack, your Pug, that longs to be
Styled, o'your pleasures.

Mrs. FIT. Hear you all this? Sir, Pray you,
She thinks her husband watches.
Come from your standing, do, a little, spare
Your self, Sir, from your watch, t'applaud your Squire,
That so well follows your instructions!

ACT. II. SCENE. III.
FITZ-DOTTRELL. Mistress FITZ-DOTTREL. PVG. HOw now, sweet heart? what is the
matter?


Mrs. FI. Good!
You are a stranger to the plot! you set not
Your saucy Devil, here, to tempt your wife,
With all the insolent uncivil language,
Or action, he could vent?

FIT. Did you so, Devil?


Mrs. FIT. Not you? you were not planted in your hole to hear him,
Vpo'the stayres? or here, behind the hangings?
I do not know your qualities? he durst do it,
And you not give directions?

FIT. You shall see, wise,
Her husband goes out, and enters presently with a cudgel upon him. Whether he
durst, or no: and what it was,
I did direct.

PVG. Sweet Mistress, are you mad?


FIT. You most mere Rogue! you open manifest Villain!
You Feind apparent you! you declared Hel-hound!

PVG. Good Sr.


FIT. Good Knave, good Rascal, and good Traitor.
Now, I do find you parcel- Devil, indeed.
Vpo' the point of trust? In Your first charge?
The very day of your probation?
To tempt your Mistress? You do see, good wedlock,
How I directed him.

Mrs. FIT. Why* where Sr, were you?


FIT. Nay, there is one blow more, for exercise: After a pause. He strikes him
again
I told you, I should do it.

PVG. Would you had done, Sir.


FIT. O wife, the rarest man! yet there is another
To put you in mind of the last* such a brave man, wife!
Within, he has his proiects, and does vent 'hem,
The gallantest! where you tentiginous? ha? and again.
Would you be acting of the Incubus?
Did her silks rustling move you?

PVG. Gentle Sir.


FIT. Out of my sight. If thy name were not Devil,
Thou should not stay a minute with me. In,
Go, yet stay: yet go too. I am resolved,
What I will do: and you shall know it aforehand.
Soon as the Gentleman is gone, do you hear?
I Will help your lisping. Wife, such a man, wife! Devil goes out.
He has such plots! He will make me a Duke!
No less, by heaven! six Mares, to your coach, wife!
That Is your proportion! And your coachman bald!
Because he shall be bare, enough. Do not you laugh,
We are looking for a place, and all, in the map
What to be of. Have faith, be not an Infidel.
You know, I am not easy to be gulled.
I swear, when I have my millions, else, I Will make
Another Duchess; if you have not faith.

Mrs. FI. You Will ha'too much, I fear, in these false spirits,

FIT. Spirits? O, no such thing! wife! wit, mere wit!
This man defies the Devil, and all his works!
He dos't by Ingine, and devises, he!
He has his winged ploughes, that go with sails,
Will plough you forty acres, at once! and mills,
Will spout you water, ten miles off! All Crowland
Is ours, wife; and the fens, from us, in Norfolk,
To the utmost bound of Lincolnshire! we have viewed it,
And measured it within all; by the scale!
The richest tract of land, Love, in the kingdom!
There will be made seventeen, or eighteen millions;
Or more, as't may be handled! wherefore, think,
Sweet heart, if thou have a fancy to one place,
More then another, to be Duchess of;
Now, name it: I will have it, what ere it cost,
(If It will be had for money) either here,
Or'n France, or Italy.

Mrs. FI. You have strange fantasies!


ACT. II. SCENE. IV.
MERE-CRAFT. FITZ-DOTTRELL. INGINE. WHere are you, Sir?


FIT. I see thou have no talent
This way, wi^e. Up to thy gallery; do, Chuck,
Leave us to talk of it, who understand it.

MER. I think we have found a place to fit you, now, Sir.
Gloc'ster.

FIT. O, no, I Will none!


MER. Why, Sr?


FIT. It Is fatal.


MER. That you say right in. Spenser, I think, the younger,
Had his last honor thence. But, he was but Earl.

FIT I know not that, Sir. But Thomas of Woodstock^,
I Am sure, was Duke, and he was made away,
At Calice; as Duke Humphrey was at Bury:
And Richard the third, you know what end he came too.

MER. By m'faith you are cunning in the Chronicle, Sir.


FIT. No, I confess I have it from the Play-bookes,
And think they'are more authentic.

ING. That Is sure, Sir.


MER. He whispers him of a place. What say you (to this then)

FIT. No, a noble house.
Pretends to that. I will do no man wrong.

MER. Then take one proposition more, and hear it
As past exception.

FIT. What Is that?


MER. To be
Duke of those lands, you shall recover: take
Your title, thence, Sir, Duke of the Drown'd-lands,
Or Drown'd-land.

FIT. Ha? that last has a good sound!
I like it well. The Duke of Drown'd-land?

ING. Yes;
It goes like Groen-land, Sir, if you mark it.

MER. I,
And drawing thus your honor from the work,
You make the reputation of that, greater;
And stay't the longer in your name.

FIT. It Is true.
Drown'd-lands will live in Drown'd-land!

MER. Yes, when you
Have no foot left; as that must be, Sir, one day.
And, though it tarry in your heirs, some forty,
Fifty descents, the longer liver, at last, yet,
Must thrust 'hem out on it: if no quirk in law,
Or odd Vice o'their own not do'it first.
We see those changes, daily: the fair lands,
That were the Clyents, are the Lawyers, now:
And those rich Manors, there, of good man Tailors,
Had once more wood upon 'hem, then the yard,
By which they were measured out for the last purchase.
Nature has these vicissitudes. She makes
No man a state of perpetuety, Sir.

FIT. Yo'are in the right. Let Us in then, and conclude. He spies Devil.
I my sight, again? I Will talk with you, anon.

ACT. II. SCENE. V.
PVG. SVre he will geld me, if I stay: or worse,
Pluck out my tongue, one of the two. This Fool,
There is no trusting of him: and to quit him,
Were a contempt against my Chief, past pardon.
It was a shrewd disheartning this, at first!
Who would have thought a woman so well harnessed,
Or rather well-caparison'd, indeed,
That wears such petticoates, and lace to her smocks,
Broad seaming laces (as I see 'hem hang there)
And garters which are lost, if she can show 'hem,
Could have done this? Hell! why is she so brave?
It cannot be to please Duke Dottrel, sure,
Nor the dull pictures, in her gallery,
Nor her own dear reflection, in her glass;
Yet that may be: I have known many of 'hem,
Begin their pleasure, but none end it, there:
(That I consider, as I go a long with it)
They may, for want of better company,
Or that they think the better, spend an hour;
Two, three, or four, discoursing with their shadow:
But sure they have a farther speculation.
No woman dressed with so much care, and study,
Does dress her self in vain. I Will vex this problem,
A little more, before I leave it, sure.

ACT. IJ. SCENE. VI.
VVITTIPOL. MANLY. Mistress FITZDOTTREL. PVG. THis was a fortune, happy above
thought,
That this should prove thy chamber; which I feared
Would be my greatest trouble! this must be
The very window, and that the room.

MAN. It is.
I now remember, I have often seen there
A woman, but I never marked her much.

WIT. Where was your soul, friend?


MAN. Faith, but now, and then,
Awake unto those objects.

WIT. You pretend so.
Let me not live, if I am not in love
More with her wit, for this direction, now,
Then with her form, though I have praised that prettily,
Since I saw her, and you, to day. Read those.
He gives him a paper, wherein is the copy of a Song. They Will go unto the
air you love so well.
Try 'hem unto the note, may be the music
Will call her sooner; light, she is here! Sing quickly.

Mrs. FIT. Either he understood him not: or else,
The fellow was not faithful in delivery,
Of what I bad. And, I am justly paid,
That might have made my profit of his service,
But, by mis-taking, have drawn on his envy,
And done the worse defeat upon my self.
Manly sings, Pug enters perceiues it. How! Music? then he may be there: and
is sure.

PVG. O! Is it so? Is there the enter-view?
Have I drawn to you, at last, my cunning Lady?
The Devil is an Ass! fooled of^! and beaten!
Nay, made an instrument! and could not sent it!
Well, since yo' have shown the malice of a woman,
No less then her true wit, and learning, Mistress,
I Will try, if little Pug have the malignity
To recompense it, and so save his danger.
It Is not the pain, but the discredit of it,
The Devil should not keep a body entire.

WIT. Away, fall back, she comes.


MAN. I Will leave you, Sir,
The Master of my chamber. I have business

WIT. Mrs!


Mrs. FI. You make me paint, Sr.


WIT. The'are fair colors,
Lady, and natural! I did receive
Some commands from you, lately, gentle Lady, This Scene is acted at two
windo's, as out of two contiguous buildings,
But so perplexed, and wrapped in the delivery,
As I may fear to have mis-interpreted:
But must make suit still, to be near your grace.

Mrs. FI. Who is there with you, Sr?


WIT. None, but my self.
It falls out, Lady, to be a dear friends lodging.
Wherein there is some conspiracy of fortune
With your poor servants blessed affections.

Mrs. FI. Who was it sung?


WIT. He, Lady, but he is gone,
Upon my entreaty of him, seeing you
Approach the window. Neither need you doubt him,
If he were here. He is too much a gentleman.

Mrs. FI. Sir, if you judge me by this simple action,
And by the outward habit, and complexion
Of easiness, it has, to your design;
You may with Justice, say, I am a woman:
And a strange woman But when you shall please,
To bring but that concurrence of my fortune,
To memory, which to day your self did urge:
It may beget some favor like excuse,
Though none like reason.

WIT. No, my tune-full Mistress?
Then, surely, Love has none; nor Beauty any;
Nor Nature-violenced, in both these:
With all whose gentle tongues you speak, at once.
I thought I had enough removed, already,
That scruple from your breast, and left yo' all reason;
When, through my mornings perspectiue I showed you
A man so above excuse, as he is the cause,
Why any thing is to be done upon him:
And nothing called an injury, mis-plac'd.
I'rather, now had hope, to show you how Love
By his accesses, grows more natural:
And, what was done, this morning, with such force
Was but devised to serve the present, then.
That since Love has the honor to approach
These sister-swelling breasts; and touch this soft, He grows more familiar in
his Court-ship.

And rosy hand; he has the skill to draw
Their Nectar forth, with kissing; and could make
More wanton salts, from this brave promontory,
Down to this valley, then the nimble Roe; plays with her paps, kisseth her
hands, etc.
Could play the hopping Sparrow, 'bout these nets;
And sporting Squirell in these crisped groves;
Bury himself in every Silke-wormes kell,
Is here vnrauell'd; run into the snare,
Which every hair is, cast into a curle,
To catch a Cupid flying: Bath himself
In milk, and roses, here, and dry him, there;
Warm his cold hands, to play with this smooth, ^ound,
And well torn'd chin, as with the Billyard ball;
Roll on these lips, the banks of love, and there
At once both plant, and gather kisses. Lady,
Shall I, with what I have made to day here, call
All sense to wonder, and all faith to sign
The mysteries revealed in your form?
And will Love pardon me the blasphemy
I vtter'd, when I said, a glass could speak
This beauty, or that fools had power to judge it?
Do but look, on her eyes! They do light --
All that Love's world comprizeth!
Do but look on her hair! it is bright,
As Love's star, when it rises!
Do but mark, her fore head's smoother,
Then words that sooth her!
And from her arched brows, such a grace
Sheds it self through the face;
As alone, there triumphs to the life,
All the gain, all the good, of the elements strife!
Have you seen but a bright Lilly grow,
Before rude hands have touched it?
Have you marked but the fall of the Snow,
Before the soil has smuch'd it?
Have you felt the wool of the Beuer?
Or Swans down, ever?
Or, have smelt of the bud of the Bryer?
Or the Nard in the fire?
Or, have tasted the bag of the Be?
O, so white! O, so soft! O, so sweet is she!

ACT. II. SCENE. VII.
FITZ-DOTTRELL. WITTIPOL. PVG. IS she so, Sir? and, I will keep her so.
Her husband appears at her back. If I know how, or can: that wit of man
Will do it, I Will go no farther. At this windo'
She shall no more be buz'd at. Take your leave on it.
If you be sweet meats, wedlock, or sweet flesh,
All Is one: I do not love this hum about you.
A flye-blowne wife is not so proper, In: He speaks out of his wives window.
For you, Sr, look to hear from me.

WIT. So, I do, Sir.


FIT. No, but in other terms. There Is no man offers
This to my wife, but paies for it.

WIT. That have I, Sir.


FIT. Nay, then, I tell you, you are.


WIT. What am I, Sir?


FIT. Why, that I Will think on, when I have cut your throat.


WIT. Go, you are an Ass.


FIT. I am resolved on it, Sir.


WIT. I think you are.


FIT. To call you to a reckoning.


WIT. Away, you brokers block, you property.


FIT. S'light, if you strike me, I Will strike your Mistress,

WIT. O! I could shoot mine eyes at him, for that, now; He strikes his wife.
Or leave my teeth in'him, were they cuckolds bane,
Enough to kill him. What prodigious,
Blind, and most wicked change of fortune's this?
I have no air of patience: all my veins
Swell, and my sinews start at iniquity of it.
I shall break, break.

PVG. This for the malice of it,
And my revenge may pass! But, now, The Devil speaks below. my conscience
Tells me, I have profited the cause of Hell
But little, in the breaking-off their loves.
Which, if some other act of mine repair not,
I shall hear ill of in my account.

FIT. O, Bird!
Could you do this? against me? and at this time, now? Fitz-dottrel enters with
his wife as come down.
When I was so employed, wholly for you,
Drowned i'my care (more, then the land, I swear,
I'haue hope to win) to make you peere-lesse? studying,
For footmen for you, fine paced huishers, pages,
To serve you of the knee; with what Knights wife,
To bear your train, and sit with your four women
In council, and receive intelligences,
From foreign parts, to dress you at all pieces!
Y'haue (a'most) turned my good affection, to you;
Sowr'd my sweet thoughts; all my pure purposes:
I could now find (i'my very heart) to make
Another, Lady Duchess; and depose you.
Well, go your ways in. Devil, you have redeemed all.
I do forgive you. And I Will do you good.

ACT. II. SCENE. VIIJ.
MERE-CRAFT. FITZ-DOTTREL. INGINE. TRAINS. WHy ha you these excursions? where
have you been, Sir?


FIT. Where I ha'beene vexed a little, with a toy!


MER. O Sir! no toys must trouble your grave head,
Now it is growing to be great. You must
Be above all those things.

FIT. Nay, nay, so I will.


MER. Now you are to'ard the Lord, you must put off
The man, Sir.

ING. He says true.


MER. You must do nothing
As you ha'done it heretofore; not know,
Or salute any man.

ING. That was your bedfellow,
The other month.

MER. The other month? the week.
Thou do not know the privileges, Ingine,
Follow that Title; nor how swift: To day,
When he has put on his Lords face once, then --

FIT. Sir, for these things I shall do well enough,
There is no fear of me. But then, my wife is
Such an untoward thing! she will never learn
How to comport with it! I am out of all
Conceit, on her behalf.

MER. Best have her taught, Sir.


FIT. Where? Are there any Schools for Ladies? Is there
An Academy for women? I do know,
For men, there was: I learned in it, my self,
Ingine whispers Merecraft, Merecraft turns to Fitz-dottrel. To make my
legs, and do my postures.

ING. Sir.
Do you remember the conceit you had --
Of The Spanish gown, at home?

MER. Ha! I do thank thee,
With all my heart, dear Ingine. Sir, there is
A certain Lady, here about the Town,
An English widow, who has lately trauell'd,
But she is called the Spaniard; cause she came
Latest from thence: and keeps the Spanish habit.
Such a rare woman! all our women here,
That are of spirit, and fashion flock, unto her,
As to their President; their Law; their Canon;
More then they ever did, to Oracle-Foreman.
Such rare receipts she has, Sir, for the face;
Such oils; such tinctures; such pomatumn's;
Such perfumes; medicines; quintessences, etc.
And such a Mistress of behavior;
She knows, from the Dukes daughter, to the Doxey,
What is their due just: and no more!

FIT. O Sir!
You please me i'this, more then mine own greatness.
Where is she? Let us have her.

MER. By your patience,
We must use means; cast how to be acquainted --

FIT. Good, Sr, about it.


MER. We must think how, first.


FIT. O!
I do not love to tarry for a thing,
When I have a mind to it. You do not know me.
If you do offer it.

MER. Your wife must send
Some pretty token to her, with a complement,
And pray to be received in her good graces,
All the great Ladies do it,

FIT. She shall, she shall,
What were it best to be?

MER. Some little toy,
I would not have it any great matter, Sir:
A Diamant ring, of forty or fifty pound,
Would do it handsomely: and be a gift
Fit for your wife to send, and her to take.

FIT. I Will go, and tell my wife on it, straight.


MER. Why this Fitz-dottrel goes out.
Is well! The clothes we'haue now: But, where is this Lady?
If we could get a witty boy, now, Ingine;
That were an excellent crack. I could instruct him,
To the true height. For any thing takes this dottrel.

ING. Why, Sir your best will be one of the players!


MER. No, there is no trusting them. They Will talk on it,
And tell their Poets.

ING. What if they do? the jest
will brook the Stage. But, there be some of'hem
Are very honest Lads. There Is Dicke Robinson
A very pretty fellow, and comes often
To a Gentleman's chamber, a friends of mine. We had
The merriest supper of it there, one night,
The Gentleman's Land-lady invited him
To'a Gossips feast, Now, he Sir brought Dick Robinson,
Dressed like a Lawyers wife, amongst 'hem all;
(I lent him clothes) but, to see him behave it;
And lay the law; and carue; and drink unto 'hem;
And then talk baudy: and send frolicks! o!
It would have burst your buttons, or not left you
A seame.

MER. They say he is an ingenious youth!


ING. O Sir! and dresses himself, the best! beyond
Forty o'your very Ladies! did you never see him?

MER. No, I do seldom see those toys. But think you,
That we may have him?

ING. Sir, the young Gentleman
I tell you of, can command him. Shall I attempt it?

MER. Yes, do it.


FIT. S'light, I cannot get my wife Enters again.
To part with a ring, on any terms: and yet,
The sollen Monkey has two.

MER. It were'gainst reason,
That you should urge it; Sir, send to a Goldsmiths,
^e not her lose by it.

FIT. How does she lose by it?
Is It not for her?

MER. Make it your own bounty,
It will have the better success; what is a matter
Of fifty pound to you, Sr.

FIT. IN have but a hundred
Pieces, to show here; that I would not break --

MER. You shall have credit, Sir. I Will send a ticket
Unto my Goldsmiths. Here, my man comes too,
Trains enters. To carry it fitly. How now, Trains? What birds?

TRA. Your Cousin Euer-ill met me, and has beat me,
Because I would not tell him where you were:
I think he has dogd me to the house too.

FIT. Well --
You shall go out at the back-doore, then, Trains.
You must get Guilt-head hither* by some means:

TRA. It Is impossible!


^IT. Tell him, we have venison,
I Will g' him a piece, and send his wife a Phesant.

TRA. A Forest moves not, till that forty pound,
Yo' had of him, last, be pai'd. He keeps more stir,
For that same petty sum, then for your bond
Of six; and Statute of eight hundred!

^IT. Tell him
We Will hedge in that. Cry up Fitz-dottrell to him,
Double his price: Make him a man of metal.

TRA. That will not need, his bond is current enough.


ACT. III. SCENE. I.
GVILT-HEAD. PLVTARCHVS. ALl this is to make you a Gentleman:
I Will have you learn, Son. Wherefore have I placed you
With Sr. Poul Either-side, but to have so much Law
To keep your own? Besides, he is a Justice,
Here in the Town; and dwelling, Son, with him,
You shall learn that in a year, shall be worth twenty
Of having stayed you at Oxford, or at Cambridge,
Or sending you to the Innes of Court, or France.
I am called for now in haste, by Master Meere-craft
To trust Master Fitz-dottrel, a good man:
IN have inquired him, eighteen hundred a year,
(His name is current) for a diamant ring
Of forty, shall not be worth thirty (that's gained)
And this is to make you a Gentleman!

PLV. O, but good father you trust too much!


GVI. Boy, boy,
We live, by finding fools out, to be trusted.
Our shop-bookes are our pastures, our corn-grounds,
We lay 'hem open, for them to come into:
And when we have 'hem there, we drive 'hem up
In ^one of our two Pounds, the Compters, straight,
And this is to make you a Gentleman!
We Citizens never trust, but we do coozen:
For, if our debtors pay, we coozen them;
And if they do not, then we coozen our selves.
But that is a hazard every one must run,
That hopes to make his Son a Gentleman!

PLV. I do not wish to be one, truly, Father.
In a descent, or two, we come to be
Just 'itheir state, fit to be coozend, like 'hem.
And I had rather have tarryed in your trade:
For, since the Gentry scorn the City so much,
Me thinks we should in time, holding together,
And matching in our own tribes, as they say,
Have got an Act of Common Council, for it,
That we might coozen them out of rerum natura.

GVI. I, if we had an Act first to forbid
The marrying of our wealthy heirs unto 'hem:
And daughters, with such lavish portions.
That confounds all.

PLV. And makes a Mungril breed, Father.
And when they have your money, then they laugh at you:
Or kick you down the stayres. I cannot abide 'hem.
I would feign have 'hem coozen'd, but not trusted.

ACT. III. SCENE. II.
MERE-CRAFT. GVILT-HEAD. FITZ-DOTTRELL. PLVTARCHVS. O, is he come! I knew he
would not fail me.
Welcome, good Guilt-head, I must have you do
A noble Gentleman, a courtesy, here:
In a mere toy (some pretty Ring, or Jewel)
Of fifty, or threescore pound (Make it a hundred,
And hedge in the last forty, that I owe you,
And your own price for the Ring) He Is a good man, Sr,
And you may hap' see him a great one! He,
Is likely to bestow hundreds, and thousands,
Wi'you; if you can humor him. A great prince
He will be shortly. What do you say?

GVI. In truth, Sir
I cannot. 'T has been a long vacation with us,

FIT. Of what, I pray thee? of wit? or honesty?
Those are your Citizens long vacations.

PLV. Good Father do not trust 'hem.


MER. Nay, Thom. Guilt-head.
He will not buy a courtesy and beg it:
He Will rather pay, then pray. If you do for him,
You must do cheerfully. His credit, Sir,
Is not yet prostitute! Who Is this? thy son?
A pretty youth, what is his name?

PLV. Plutarchus, Sir.


MER. Plutarchus! How came that about?


GVI. That year Sr,
That I begot him, I bought Plutarch's lives,
And fell s' in love with the book, as I called my son
By 'his name; In hope he should be like him:
And write the lives of our great men!

MER. In The City?
And you do breed him, there?

GVI. His mind, Sir, lies
Much to that way.

MER. Why, then, he is in the right way.


GVI. But, now, I had rather get him a good wife,
And plant him in the country; there to use
The blessing I shall leave him*

MER. Out upon it!
And lose the laudable means, thou have at home, here,
T'aduance, and make him a young Alderman?
Buy him a Captains place, for shame; and let him
Into the world, early, and with his plume,
And Scarfes, march through Cheapside, or along Cornehill,
And by the vertue' of those, draw down a wife
There from a windo', worth ten thousand pound!
Get him the posture book, and's leaden men,
To set upon a table, against his Mistress
Chance to come by, that he may draw her in,
And show her Finsbury battles.

GVI. I have placed him
With Justice Eytherside, to get so much law --

MER. As thou have conscience. Come, come, thou do wrong
Pretty Plutarchus, who had not his name,
For nothing: but was borne to train the youth
Of London, in the military truth --
That way his Genius lies. My Cousin Euerill!

ACT. III. SCENE. IIJ.
EVER-ILL. PLVTARCHVS. GVILT-HEAD. MERE-CRAFT. FITZDOTTRELL. O, are you here,
Sir? 'pray you let us whisper.


PLV. Father, dear Father, trust him if you love me.


GVI. Why, I do mean it, boy; but, what I do,
Must not come easily from me: We must deal
With Courtiers, boy, as Courtiers deal with us.
If I have a Business there, with any of them,
Why, I must wait, I Am sure on it, Son: and though
My Lord dispatch me, yet his worshipful man --
Will keep me for his sport, a month, or two,
To show me with my fellow Citizens.
I must make his train long, and full, one quarter;
And help the spectacle of his greatness. There,
Nothing is done at once, but injuries, boy:
And they come headlong! all their good turns move not,
Or very slowly

PLV. Yet sweet father, trust him.


GVI. Well, I will think.


EV. Come, you must do it, Sir.
I Am undone else, and your Lady Tayle-bush
Has sent for me to dinner, and my clothes
A^e all at pawn. I had sent out this morning,
Before I heard you were come to town, some twenty
Of my epistles, and no one return --

MER. Mere-craft tells him of his faults. Why, I have told you of this. This
comes of wearing
Scarlet, gold lace, and cut-works! your fine gartring!
With your blown roses, Cousin! and your eating
Phesant, and Godwit, here in London! haunting
The Globes, and Mermaides! wedging in with Lords,
Still at the table! and affecting lechery,
In velvet! where could you have contented your self
With cheese, salt-butter, and a pickled hering,
In The Low Countries; there worn cloth, and fustian!
Been satisfied with a leap of your Host's daughter,
In garrison, a wench of a stoter! or,
Your Sutlers wife, in the leaguer, of two blanks!
You never, then, had run upon this flat,
To write your letters missiue, and send out
Your privy seals, that thus have frighted off
All your acquintance; that they shun you at distance,
Worse, then you do the Bailies!

EV. Pox upon you.
He repines, I come not to you for counsel, I lack money.

MER. You do not think, what you owe me already?


EV. I?
They owe you, that mean to pay you. I Will besworne,
I never meant it. Come, you will project,
I shall undo your practice, for this month else:
and threatens him. You know me.

MER. I, yo' are a right sweet nature!


EV. Well, that is all one!


MER. You Will leave this Empire, one day?
You will not ever have this tribute paid,
Your scepter of the sword?

EV. Tie up your wit,
Do, and provoke me not --

MER. Will you, Sir, help,
To what I shall provoke another for you?

EV. I cannot tell; try me: I think I am not
So utterly, of an ore vn-to-be-melted,
But I can do my self good, on occasions.

MER. They join. Strike in then, for your part. Mr. Fitz-dottrel
If I transgress in point of manners, afford me
Your best construction; I must beg my freedom
From your affairs, this day.

FIT. How, Sr.


MER. It is
Mere-craft pretends business. In succor of this Gentleman's occasions,
My kins-man --

FIT. You Will not do me that affront, Sr.


MER. I am sorry you should so interpret it,
But, Sir, it stands upon his being invested
In a new office, he has stood for, long: Mere-craft describes the office of
Dependancy.

Master of the Dependances! A place
Of my proiection too, Sir, and has met
Much opposition; but the State, now, see's
That great necessity of it, as after all
Their writing, and their speaking, against Duells,
They have erected it. His book is drawn --
For, since, there will be differences, daily,
'Twixt Gentlemen; and that the roaring manner
Is grown offensive; that those few, we call
The civil men of the sword, abhor the vapors;
They shall refer now, hither, for their process;
And such as trespass against the rule of Court,
Are to be fined --

FIT. In troth, a pretty place!


MER^ A kind of arbitrary Court 'twill be, Sir.


FIT. I shall have matter for it, I believe,
Ere it be long: I had a distaste.

MER. But now, Sir,
My learned council, they must have a feeling,
They Will part, Sir, with no books, without the hand gout
Be oyld, and I must furnish. If It be money,
To me straight. I am Mine, Mint and Exchequer,
To supply all. What is it? a hundred pound?

EVE. No, the Harpey, now, stands on a hundred pieces.


MER. Why, he must have 'hem, if he will. To morrow, Sir,
Will equally serve your occasion's, --
And therefore, let me obtain, that you will yield
To timing a poor Gentleman's distresses,
In terms of hazard. --

FIT. By no means!


MER. I must
Get him this money, and will. --

FIT. Sir, I protest,
I Would rather stand engaged for it my self:
Then you should leave me.

MER. O good Sr. do you think
So coursely of our manners, that we would,
For any need of ours, be pressed to take it:
Though you be pleased to offer it.

FIT. Why, by heaven,
I mean it!

MER. I can never believe less.
But we, Sir, must preserve our dignity, He offers to be gone.

As you do publish yours. By your fair leave, Sir.

FIT. As I am a Gentleman, if you do offer
To leave me now, or if you do refuse me,
I will not think you love me.

MER. Sir, I honor you.
And with just reason, for these noble notes,
Of the nobility, you pretend too! But, Sir --
I would know, why? a motive (he a stranger)
You should do this?

EVE. You Will mar all with your finenesse

FIT. Why, that is all one, if'twere, Sir, but my fancy.
But I have a Business, that perhaps I Would have
Brought to his office.

MER. O, Sir! I have done, then;
If he can be made profitable, to you.

FIT. Yes, and it shall be one of my ambitions
To have it the first Business? May I not?

EVE. So you do mean to make it, a perfect Business.


FIT. Nay, I Will do that, assure you: show me once.


MER. Sr, it concerns, the first be a perfect Business,
For his own honor!

EVE. I, and th'reputation
Too, of my place.

FIT. Why, why do I take this course, else?
I am not altogether, an Ass, good Gentlemen,
Wherefore should I consult you? do you think?
To make a song on it? How Is your manner? tell us.

MER. Do, satisfy him: give him the whole course.


EVE. First, by request, or otherwise, you offer
Your Business to the Court: wherein you crave:
The judgment of the Master and the Assistants.

FIT. Well, that is done, now, what do you upon it?


EVE. We straight Sr, have recourse to the springhead;
Visit the ground; and, so disclose the nature:
If it will carry, or no. If we do find,
By our proportions it is like to prove
A sul^en, and black Business That it be
Incorrigible; and out of, treaty; then,
We file it, a Dependence!

FIT. So it is filled.
What follows? I do love the order of these things.

EVE. We then advise the party, if he be
A man of means, and hauings, that forthwith,
He settle his estate: if not, at least
That he pretend it. For, by that, the world
Takes notice, that it now is a Dependence.
And this we call, Sir, Publication.

FIT. Very sufficient! After Publication, now?


EVE. Then we grant out our Process, which is diverse;
Either by Chartell, Sir, or ore-tenus,
Wherein the Challenger, and Challengee
Or (with your Spaniard) your Prouocador,
And Prouocado, have their several courses --

FIT. I have enough on it! for an hundred pieces?
Yes, for two hundred, vnder-write me, do.
Your man will take my bond?

MER. That he will, sure,
But, these same Citizens, they are such sharks!
He whispers Fitz-dottrell aside. There Is an old debt of forty, I ga^ my word
For one is run away, to the Bermudas,
And he will hook in that, or he wi' not do.

FIT. Why, let him. That and the ring, and a hundred pieces,
Will all but make two hundred?

MER. No, no more, Sir.
What ready Arithmetique you have? do you hear?
And then Guilt-head A pretty mornings work for you, this? Do it,
You shall have twenty pound on it.

GVI. Twenty pieces?


(PLV. Good Father, do it)

MER. You will hook still? well,
Show us your ring. You could not have done this, now
With gentleness, at first, we might have thanked you?
But groan, and have you courtesies come from you
Like a hard stool, and stink? A man may draw
Your teeth out easier, then your money? Come,
Were little Guilt-head here, no better a nature, He pulls Plutarchus by the
lips.
I should never love him, that could pull his lips off, now!
Was not thy mother a Gentlewoman?

PLV. Yes, Sir.


MER. And went to the Court at Christmas, and St. Georges-tide?
And lent the Lords-men, chains?

PLV. Of gold, and pearl, Sr.


MER. I knew, thou must take, after some body!
Thou could not be else. This was no shop-looke!
'll have thee Captain Guilt-head, and march up,
And take in Pimlico,, and kill the bush,
At every tavern! Thou shall have a wife,
If smocks will mount, boy. How now? you ha'there now
Some Bristo-stone, He turns to old Guilt-head. or Cornish counterfeit
You Would put upon us.

GVI. No, Sir, I assure you:
Look on his luster! he will speak himself!
I Will gi'you leave to put him in the Mill,
H'is no great, large stone, but a true Paragon,
H'has all his corners, view him well.

MER. H'is yellow.


GVI. Vpo'my faith, Sr, of the right black-water,
And very deep! H'is set without a foil, too.
Here Is one of the yellow-water, I Will sell cheap.

MER. And what do you value this, at? thirty pound?


GVI. No, Sir, he cost me forty, ere he was set.


MER. Turnings, you mean? I know your Equinocks:
You'are grown the better Fathers of'hem o'late.
Well, where't must go, 'twill be judged, and, therefore,
Look you't be right. You shall have fifty pound for it.
Not a deneer more! And, Now to Fitz-dottrel. because you would
Have things dispatched, Sir, I Will go presently,
Inquire out this Lady. If you think good, Sir.
Having an hundred pieces ready, you may
Part with those, now, to serve my kinsmans turns,
That he may wait upon you, anon, the freer;
And take 'hem when you have sealed, a gain, of Guilt-head.

FIT. I care not if I do!


MER. And dispatch all,
Together.

FIT. There, they are just: a hundred pieces!
IN ha'told 'hem over, twice a day, these two months. He turns 'hem out
together. And Euerill and he fall to share.

MER. Well, go, and seal then, Sr, make your return
As speedy as you can.

EVE. Come gi' me.


MER. Soft, Sir,

EVE^ Mary, and fair too, then. I Will no delaying, Sir.


MER. But, you will hear?


EV. Yes, when I have my diuident.


MER. There Is forty pieces for you.


EVE. What is this for?


MER. Your half. You know, that Guilt-head must have twenty.


EVE. And what is your ring there? shall I have none o'that?


MER. O, that's to be given to a Lady!


EVE. Is It so?


MER. By that good light, it is.


EV. Come, gi'me
Ten pieces more, then.

MER. Why?


EV. For Guilt-head? Sir,
Do'you think, I Will 'low him any such share:

MER. You must.


EVE. Must I? Do you your musts, Sir, I Will do mine,
You wi'not part with the whole, Sir? Will you? Go too.
Gi' me ten pieces!

MER. By what law, do you this?


EVE. E'n Lyon-law, Sir, I must roar else.


MER. Good!


EVE. Yo' have heard, how the Ass made his divisions, wisely?


MER. And, I am he: I thank you.


EV. Much good do you, Sr.


MER. I shall be rid of this tyranny, one day?


EVE. Not,
While you do eat; and lie, about the town, here;
And coozen in your bullions; and I stand
Your name of credit, and compound your business;
Adiourne your beatings every term; and make
New parties for your proiects. I have, now,
A pretty tasque, of it, to hold you in
W^' your Lady Tayle-bush: but the toy will be,
How we shall both come off?

MER. Leave you your doubting.
And do your portion, what is assigned you: I
Never failed yet.

EVE. With reference to your aids?
You Will still be unthankful. Where shall I meet you, anon?
You have some feate to do alone, now, I see;
You wish me gone, well, I will find you out,
And bring you after to the audit.

MER. S'light!
There Is Ingines share too, I had forgot! This reign
Is too-too-vnsuportable! I must
Quit my self of this vassalage! Ingine! welcome.

ACT. IIJ. SCENE. IV.
MERE-CRAFT. INGINE. VVITTIPOL. HOw goes the cry?


ING. Excellent well!


MER. Will It do?
Where Is Robinson?

ING. Here is the Gentleman, Sir.
Will undertake t'himselfe. I have acquainted him,

MER. Why did you so?


ING. Why, Robinson would ha'told him,
You know. And he is a pleasant wit! will hurt
Nothing you purpose. Then, he'is of opinion,
That Robinson might want audacity,
She being such a gallant. Now, he has been,
In Spain, and knows the fashions there; and can
Discourse; and being but mirth (he says) leave much,
To his care:

MER. But he is too tall!


ING. For that,
He has the brauest device! He excepts at his stature.
(you will love him for it)
To say, he wears Cioppinos: and they do so
In Spain. And Robinson's as tall, as he.

MER. Is he so?


ING. Every jot.


MER. Nay, I had rather
To trust a Gentleman with it, of the two.

ING. Pray you go to him, then, Sir, and salute him.


MER. Sir, my friend Ingine has acquainted you
With a strange business, here.

WIT. A merry one, Sir.
The Duke of Drown'd-land, and his Duchess?

MER. Yes, Sir.
Now, that the Coniurers have laid him by,
I have made bold, to borrow him a while;

WIT. With purpose, yet, to put him out I hope
To his best use?

MER. Yes, Sir.


WIT. For that small part,
That I am trusted with, put off your care:
I would not lose to do it, for the mirth,
Will follow of it; and well, I have a fancy.

MER. Sir, that will make it well.


WIT. You will report it so.
Where must I have my dressing?

ING. At my house, Sir.


MER. You shall have caution, Sir, for what he yields,
To six pence.

WIT. You shall pardon me. I will share, Sir,
IN your sports, only: nothing in your purchase.
But you must furnish me with complements,
To the manner of Spain; my coach, my guarda duenn'as;

MER. Ingine's your Pro'uedor. But, Sir, I must
(Now I'haue entered trust wi'you, thus far)
Secure still in your quality, acquaint you
With somewhat, beyond this. The place, designed
To be the Scene, for this our merry matter,
Because it must have countenance of women,
To draw discourse, and offer it, is here by,
At the Lady Taile-bushes.

WIT. I know her, Sir,
And her Gentleman huisher.

MER. Mr Ambler?


WIT. Yes, Sir.


MER. Sir, It shall be no shame to me, to confess
To you, that we poor Gentlemen, that want acres,
Must for our needs, turn fools up, and plough Ladies
Sometimes, to try what glebe they a^e: and this
Is no unfruitful piece. She, and I now,
Are on a project, for the fact, and venting
Of a new kind of fucus (paint, for Ladies)
To serve the kingdom: wherein she her self
Has trauell'd, specially, by way of service
Unto her sex, and hopes to get the Monopoly,
As the reward, of her invention.

WIT. What is her end, in this?


EV. Merely ambition,
Sir, to grow great, and court it with the secret:
Though she pretend some other. For, she is dealing,
Already, upon caution for the shares,
And Mr. Ambler, is he named Examiner
For the ingredients; and the Register
Of what is vented; and shall keep the Office.
Now, if she break with you, of this (as I
Must make the leading thread to your acquaintance,
That, how experience gotten in your being
Abroad, will help our business) think of some
Pretty additions, but to keep her floting:
It may be, she will offer you a part,
Any strange names of --

WIT. Sr, I have my'instructions.
Is it not high time to be making ready?

MER. Yes, Sir,


ING. The foole's in sight, Dottrel.


MER. Away, then.


ACT. IIJ. SCENE. V.
MERE-CRAFT. FITZ-DOTTREL. PVG. Returned so soon?


FIT. Yes, here is the ring: I ha'seal'd.
But there is not so much gold in all the row, he says --
Till'^ come fro' the Mint. It Is taken up for the gamesters.

MER. There Is a shop-shift! plague on'hem.


FIT. He does swear it.


MER. He Will swear, and forswear too, it is his trade,
You should not have left him.

FIT. S'lid, I can go back,
And beat him, yet.

MER. No, now let him alone.


FIT. I was so earnest, after the maine Business,
To have this ring, gone.

MER. True, and it is time.
I have learned, Sir, sin' you went, her Ladi^ship ^ats
With the Lady Tail bush, here, hard by.

FIT. In The lane here?


MER. Yes, if you' had a servant, now of presence,
Well clothed, and of an ae^y voluble tongue,
Neither too big, or little for his mouth,
That could deliver your wives complement;
To send along withal.

FIT. I have one Sir,
A very handsome, gentleman-like-fellow,
That I do mean to make my Duchess Usher --
I entertained him, but this morning, too:
I Will call him to you. The worst of him, is his name!

MER. She Will take no note of that, but of his message. He shows him his Pug.


FIT. Devil! How like you him, Sir. Pace, go a little.
Let Us see you move.

MER. He Will serve, Sr, give it him:
And let him go along with me, I Will help
To present him, and it.

FIT. Look, you do sirah,
Discharge this well, as you expect your place.
Do'you hear, go on, come off with all your honors.
I would feign see him, do it.

MER. Trust him, with it; Gives him instructions.


FIT. Remember kissing of your hand, and answering
With the French-time, in flexure of your body.
I could now* so instruct him -- and for his words --

MER. I Will put them in his mouth.


FIT. O, but I have 'hem
Of The very Academies.

MER. Sir, you will have use for 'hem,
Anon, your self, I warrant you: after dinner,
When you are called.

FIT. S'light, that'll be just play-time. He longs to (...).

It cannot be, I must not lose the play!

MER. Sir, but you must, if she appoint to sit.
And, she is president.

FIT. S'lid, it is the Devil! Because it is the Devil.



MER. And, 'twere his Damme too, you must now apply
Your self, Sir, to this, wholly; or lose all.

FIT. If I could but see a piece --

MER. Sr. Never think on it.


FIT. Come but to one act, and I did not care --
But to be seen to rise, and go away,
To vex the Players, and to punish their Poet --
K^epe him in awe!

MER. But say, that he be one,
Wi'not be awed! but laugh at you. How then?

FIT. Then he shall pay for 'his dinner himself.


MER. Perhaps,
He would do that twice, rather then thank you.
Come, get the Devil out of your head, my Lord,
(I Will call you so in private still) and take
Your Lord ship in your mind. You were, sweet Lord, He puts him in mind of his
quarrel.

In ta^ke to bring a Business to the Office.

FIT. Yes.


MER. Why should no^ you, Sr, carry it o'your self,
Before the Office be up? and show the world,
You had no need of any man's direction;
In point, Sir, of sufficiency. I speak
Against a kinsman, but as one that tenders
Your graces good.

FIT. I thank you; to proceed --

MER. To Publications: ha* your Deed drawn presently.
And leave a blancke to put in your Feoff^es
One, two, or more, as you see cause --

FIT. I thank you
Heartily, I do thank you. Not a word more,
I pray you, as you love me. Let me alone.
That I could not think of this, as well, as he? He is angry with himself.

O, I could beat my infinite blocke-head --!

MER. Come, we must this way.


PVG. How far is it.


MER. Hard by here
Over the way. Now, to atchieue this ring,
He thi^kes how to coozen the bearer, of the ring.
From this same fellow, that is to assure it;
Before he give it. Though my Spanish Lady,
Be a young Gentleman of means, and scorn
To share, as he does say, I do not know
How such a toy may tempt his Lady-ship:
And therefore, I think best, it be assured.

PVG. Sir, be the Ladies brave, we go unto?


MER. O, yes.


PVG. And shall I see 'hem, and speak to 'hem?


MER. What else? ha'you your false-beard about you? Trains.


TRA. Questions his man.
Yes,


MER. And is this one of your double Cloakes?


TRA. The best of 'hem.


MER. Be ready then. Sweet Pi^fall!


ACT. IIJ. SCENE. VI.
MERE-CRAFT. PITFALL. PVG. TRAINS. COme, I must busse --


PIT. Away.


MER. I Will set thee up again.
Offers to kiss. Never fear that: can thou get never a bird?
No Thrushes hungry? Stay, till cold weather come,
I Will help thee to an Onsell, or, a Field-fare.
She runs in, in haste: he follows. Who Is within, with Madame?

PIT. I Will tell you straight.


MER. Please you stay here, a while Sir, I Will go in.


PVG. I do so long to have a little venery,
While I am in this body! I would taste
Pug leaps at Pitfall's coming in. Of every sin, a little, if it might be
After the manner of man! Sweetheart!

PIT. What would you, Sr?


PVG. Nothing but fall in, to you, be your Blackbird,
My pretty pit (as the Gentleman said) your Throstle:
Lie tame, and taken with you; here'is gold!
To buy you so much new stuffes, from the shop,
Traine's in his false cloak, brings a false message, and gets the ring.
Mere-craft follows presently, and asks for it. Ent. Train's as himself
again. As I may take the old up --

TRA. You must send, Sir.
The Gentleman the ring.

PVG. There it is. Nay look,
Will you be foolish, Pit,

PIT. This is strange rudeness.


PVG. Dear Pit.


PIT. I Will call, I swear.


MER. Where are you, Sr?
Is your ring ready? Go with me.

PVG. I sent it you.


MER. Me? When? by whom?


PVG. A fellow here, even now,
Came for it in your name.

MER. I sent none, sure.
My meaning ever was, you should deliver it,
Your self: So was your Masters charge, you know.
What fellow was it, do you know him?

PVG. Here,
But now, he had it.

MER. Saw you any? Trains?


TRA. Not I.


PVG. The Gentleman saw him.


MER. Enquire.


PVG. I was so earnest upon her, I marked not! The Devil confess^th himself
c^ozen'd.

My devilish Chief has put me here in flesh,
To shame me! This dull body I am in,
I perceive nothing with! I offer at nothing,
That will succeed!

TRA. Sir, she saw none, she says.


PVG. Satan himself, has taken a shape to abuse me.
It could not be else!

MER. This is above strange! Mere-craft accuses him of negligence.

That you should be so retchlesse. What'll you do, Sir?
How will you answer this, when you are questioned?

PVG. Run from my flesh, if I could* put off mankind!
This's such a scorn! and will be a new exercise,
For my Archduke! Woe to the several cudgells,
Must suffer, on this back! Can you no succors? Sir?

MER. Alas! the use of it is so present,

PVG I ask, He asks aid.

Sir, credit for another, but till to morrow?

MER. There is not so much time, Sir. But how ever,
The Lady is a noble Lady, and will
(To save a Gentleman from check) be entreated
To say, she has received it.

PVG. Do you think so? Mere-craft promises faintly, yet comforts him.

Will she be won?

MER. No doubt, to such an office,
It will be a Lady's bravery, and her pride.

PVG. And not be known on it after, unto him?


MER. That were a treachery! Upon my word,
Be confident. Return unto your master,
My Lady President sits this afternoon,
Ha'stan^ the ring, commends her services
unto your Lady-Dutchesse. You may say
She Is a civil Lady, and does give her
All her respects, already: Bad you, tell her
She lives, but to receive her wished commandments,
And have the honor here to kiss her hands:
For which she will stay this hour yet. Hasten you
Your Prince, away.

PVG. And Sir, The Devil is doubtful.
you will take care
Th'excuse be perfect?

MER. You confess your fears.
Too much.

PVG. The shame is more, I Will quit you of either.


ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. I.
TAILE-BVSH. MERE-CRAFT. MANLY. A Pox vpo' referring to Commissioners,
I'had rather hear that it were past the seals:
Your Courtiers move so Snaile-like in your Business.
Wuld I had not begun wi'you.

MER. We must move,
Madame, in order, by degrees: not iump.

TAY. Why, there was Sr. John Monie-man could iump
A Business quickly.

MER. True, he had great friends,
But, because some, sweet Madame, can leap ditches,
We must not all shun to go over bridges.
The harder parts, I make account are done:
He flatters her.
Now, it is referred. You are infinitely bound
Unto the Ladies, they have so cried it up!

TAY. Do they like it then?


MER. They have sent the Spanish-Lady,
To gratulate with you --

TAY. I must send 'hem thanks
And some remembrances.

MER. That you must, and visit 'hem.
Where Is Ambler?

TAY. Lost, to day, we cannot hear of him.


MER. Not Madam?


TAY. No in good faith. They say he lay not
At home, to night. And here has fallen a Business
Between your Cousin, and Master Manly, has
Unquieted us all.

MER. So I hear, Madame.
Pray you how was it?

TAY. Troth, it but appears
Ill o'your Kinsmans part. You may have heard,
That Manly is a suitor to me, I doubt not:

MER. I guessed it, Madame.


TAY. And it seems, he trusted
Your Cousin to let fall some fair reports
Of him unto me.

MER. Which he did!


TAY. So far
From it, as he came in, and took him railing
Against him.

MER. How! And what said Manly to him?


TAY. Enough, I do assure you: and with that scorn
Of him, and the injury, as I do wonder
How Euerill bore it! But that guilt vndoe's
Many men's valors

MER. Here comes Manly.


MAN. Madame, Manly offer^ to be gone.

I Will take my leave --

TAY. You shall not go, in faith.
I Will have you stay, and see this Spanish miracle,
Of our English Lady.

MAN. Let me pray your Ladyship,
Lay your commands on me, some other time.

TAY. Now, I protest: and I will have all piec'd,
And friends again.

MAN. It will be but ill solder'd*


TAY. You are too much affected with it.


MAN. I cannot
Madame, but think on it for th'iniustice.

TAY. Sir,
His kinsman here is sorry.

MER. Not I, Madam,
I am no kin to him, we but call Cousins, Mere-craft denies him.

And if we were, Sir, I have no relation
Unto his crimes.

MAN. You are not urged with 'hem.
I can accuse, Sir, none but mine own judgment,
For though it were his crime, so to betray me:
I Am sure, 'twas more mine own, at all to trust him.
But he, therein, did use but his old manners,
And savor strongly what he was before.

TAY. Come, he will change!


MAN. Faith, I must never think it.
Nor were it reason in me to expect
That for my sake, he should put off a nature
He sucked in with his milk. It may be Madam,
Deceiving trust, is all he has to trust to:
If ^o, I shall be loath, that any hope
Of mine, should bate him of his means.

TAY. Yo'are sharp, Sir.
This act may make him honest!

MAN If he were
To be made honest, by an act of Parliament,
I should not alter, i'my faith of him.

TAY. Eyther-side!
Welcome, dear Either-side! how have thou done, good wench? She spies the Lady
Eyther-side.
Thou have been a stranger! I have not seen thee, this week.

ACT. IIIJ. SCEN. E II.
EJTHERSIDE. To them EVer your servant, Madame.


TAY. Where hast'hou been?
I did so long to see thee.

EIT. Visiting, and so tired!
I protest, Madame, it is a monstrous trouble!

TAY. And so it is. I swear I must to morrow,
Begin my visits (would they were over) at Court.
It tortures me, to think on'hem.

EIT. I do hear
You have cause, Madam, your suit goes on.

TAY. Who told thee?


EYT. One, that can tell: Mr. Eyther-side.


TAY. O, thy husband!
Yes faith, there is life in it, now: It is referred.
If we once see it under the seals, wench, then,
Have with 'hem for the great Carroch, six horses,
And the two Coach-men, with my Ambler, bare,
And my three women: we will live, in faith,
The examples of the town, and govern it.
I Will lead the fashion still.

EIT. You do that, now,
Sweet Madame.

TAY. O, but then, I Will every day
Bring up some new device. Thou and I, Either-side,
Will first be in it, I will give it thee;
And they shall follow us. Thou shall, I swear,
Wear every month a new gown, out of it.

EIT. Thank you good Madame.


TAY. Pray thee call me Taile-bush
As I thee, Either-side; I not love this, Madame.

EYT. Then I protest to you, Taile-bush, I am glad
Your Business so succeeds.

TAY. Thank thee, good Eyther-side.


EYT. But Master Either-side tells me, that he likes
Your other Business better.

TAY. Which?


EIT. Of The Tooth-picks.


TAY. I never heard on it.


EIT. Ask Mr. Mere craft.


MER. Madame? H'is one, in a word, I Will trust his malice,
With any man's credit, I would have abused!

MAN. Mere-craft has whispered with (...) while. Sir, if you think you do
please me, in this,
You are deceived!

MER. No, but because my Lady,
Named him my kinsman; I would satisfy you,
What I think of him: and pray you, upon it
To judge me!

MAN. So I do: that ill men's friendship,
Is as unfaithful, as themselves.

TAY. Do you hear?
Ha'you a Business about Tooth-picks?

MER. Yes, Madame.
Did I never tell't you? I meant to have offered it
Your Lady-ship* on the perfecting the pattent.

TAY. How is it!


MER. For serving the whole state with Tooth-picks; The (...) Tooth-picks.

(Somewhat an intricate Business to discourse) but --
I show, how much the Subject is abused,
First, in that one commodity? then what diseases,
And putrefactions in the gummes are bred,
By those are made' of' adultrate, and false wood?
My plot, for reformation of these, follows.
To have all Tooth-picks, brought unto an office,
There sealed; and such as counterfeit 'hem* mulcted.
And last, for venting 'hem to have a book
Printed, to teach their use, which every child
Shall have throughout the kingdom, that can read,
And learn to pick his teeth by. Which beginning
Early to practice, with some other rules,
Of never sleeping with the mouth open, ch^wing
Some grains of masticke, Trains his man whispers him. will preserve the
breath
Pure, and so free from tayn! -- ha'what is it? sai'st thou?

TAY. Good faith, it sounds a very pretty Business!


EIT. So Mr Either-side says, Madame.


MER. The Lady is come.


TAY. Is she? Good, wait upon her in. My Ambler
Was never so ill absent. Either-side,
How do I look to day? Am I not dressed, She looks in her glass
Spruntly?

^IT. Yes, verily, Madame.


TAY. Pox of Madame,
Will you not leave that?

EIT. Yes, good Taile-bush.


TAY. So?
Sounds not that better? What vile Fucus is this,
Thou have got on?

EIT. It Is Pearl.


TAY. Pearl? Oyster-shells:
As I breath, Either-side, I know it. Here comes
(They say) a wonder, sirrah, has been in Spain!
Will teach us all! she is sent to me, from Court.
To gratulate with me! Pr'y thee, let us observe her,
What faults she has, that we may laugh at 'hem,
When she is gone,

EIT. That we will heartily, Tail-bush. Wittipol enters.

TAY. O, me! the very Infanta of the Giants!


ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. IJI.
MERE-CRAFT. WITTIPOL. to them. MER. Here is a noble Lady, Madame, come,
Wittipol i^ dressed like a Spanish Lady. Excuses him self for not kissing. From
your great friends, at Court, to see your Ladi-ship:
And have the honor of your acquaintance.

TAY. Sir.
She does us honor.

WIT. Pray you, say to her Ladyship,
It is the manner of Spain, to embrace only,
Never to kiss. She will excuse the custom!

TAY. Your use of it is law. Please you, sweet, Madame,
To take a seat.

WIT. Yes, Madame. IN have had
The favor, through a world of fair report
^o know your virtues, Madame; and in that
Name, have desired the happiness of presenting
My service to your Ladyship!

TAY. Your love, Madame,
I must not own it else.

WIT. Both are due, Madame,
To your great undertakings.

TAY. Great? In troth, Madame,
They are my friends, that think 'hem any thing:
^f I can do my sex (by 'hem) any service,
I'haue my ends, Madame.

WIT. And they are noble ones,
That make a multitude beholden, Madame*
The commonwealth of Ladies, must acknowledge from you.

EIT. Except some envious, Madame.


WIT. Yo'are right in that, Madame,
Of which race, I encountered some but lately.
^^ho ('t seems) have studied reasons to discredit
Your business.

TAY. How* sweet Madame.


WIT. Nay, the parties
Wi'not be worth your pause -- Most ruinous things, Madame,
That have put off all hope of being recouer'd
To a degree of handsomeness.

TAY. But their reasons, Madame?
I would feign hear.

WIT. Some Madame, I remember.
They say, that painting quite destroys the face --

E^T. O, that is an old one, Madame.


WIT. There are new ones, too.
Corrupts the breath; has left so little sweetness
In kissing, as it is now used, but for fashion:
And shortly will be taken for a punishment.
Decays the fore-teeth, that should guard the tongue;
And suffers that run riot euer-lasting!
And (which is worse) some Ladies when they meet
Manly begins to know him. Cannot be merry, and laugh, but they do spit
In one another faces!

MAN. I should know
This voice, and face too:

WIT. Then they say, it is dangerous
To all the fallen, yet well disposed Mad-dames,
That are industrious, and desire to earne
Their living with their sweat! For any distemper
Of heat, and motion, may displace the colors;
And if the paint once run about their faces,
Twenty to one, they will appear so ill-fauour'd,
Their servants run away, too, and leave the pleasure
Imperfect, and the reckoning als' vnpay'd.

EIT. Pox, these are Poets reasons.


TAY. Some old Lady
That keeps a Poet, has devised these scandales.

EIT. Faith we must have the Poets banished, Madame,
As Master Either-side says.

MER. Master Fitz dottrel?
And his wife: where? Madame, the Duke of Drown'd-land,
That will be shortly.

WIT. Is this my Lord?


MER. The same.


ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. IV.
FITZ-DOTTREL. Mistress FITZ-DOTTRELL. PVG. to them. YOur servant, Madame!


WIT. How now? Friend? offended,
That I have found your haunt here?

MAN. No, Wittipol whispers with Manly. but wondering
At your strange fashioned venture, hither.

WIT. It is
To show you what they are, you so pursue.

MAN. I thinke't will prove a medicine against marriage;
To know their manners.

WIT. Stay, and profit then.


MER. The Lady, Madame, whose Prince has brought her, here,
To be instructed.

WIT. Please you sit with us, Lady. He presents Mistress Fitz-dottrel.


MER. That Is Lady-President.


FIT. A goodly woman!
I cannot see the ring, though.

MER. Sir, she has it.


TAY. But, Madame, these are very feeble reasons!


WIT. So I urged Madame, that the new complexion,
Now to come forth, in name o'your Ladiship's fucus,
Had no ingredient --

TAY. But I durst eat, I assure you.


WIT. So do they, in Spain.


TAY. Sweet Madam be so liberal,
To give us some o'your Spanish Fucuses!

WIT. They are infinite, Madame.


TAY. So I hear, they have
Water of Gourdes, of Radish, the white Beans,
Flowers of Glass, of Thistles, Rose-marine.
Raw Honey, Mustard Seed, and Bread dough-bak'd,
The crumbs o'bread, Goats-milke, and whites of Eggs,
Campheere, and Lilly-roots, the fat of Swannes,
Marrow of Veale, white Pigeons, and pine- kernells,
The seeds of Nettles, perse'line, and hares gall.
Limons, thin-skind --

EIT. How, her Ladyship has studied
Al excellent things!

WIT. But ordinary, Madame.
No, the true rarities, are the Aluagada,
And Argenta^a of Queen Isabella!

TAY. I, what are their ingredients, gentle Madame?


WIT. Your Alum Scagliola, or Pol-dipedra;
And Zuccarino; Turpentine of Abezzo.
VVash'd in nine waters: Soda di leuante,
Or your Fern ashes; Benjamin di gotta;
Grasso di serpe; Porcelletto marino;
Oils of Lentisco; Zucche Mugia; make
The admirable Vernish for the face,
Gives the right luster; but two drops rubbed on
Wi^h a piece of scarlet, makes a Lady of sixty
Look at sixteen. But, above all, the water
Of the white Hen, of the Lady Estifanias!

TAY. O, I, that same, good Madame, I have heard of:
How is it done?

WIT. Madame, you take your Hen,
Plume it, and skin it, cleanse it of the inwards:
Then chop it, bones and all: add to four ounces
Of Carrnuacins, Pipitas, Soap of Cyprus,
Make the decoction, streine it. Then distill it,
And keep it in your galley-pot well, glidder'd:
Three drops preserues from wrinkles, warts, spots, moles,
Blemish, or Sun-burnings, and keeps the skin
In decimo sexto, ever bright, and smooth,
As any looking-glass; and indeed, is called
The Virgins milk for the face, Oglio reale;
A Ceruse, neither cold or heat, will hurt;
And mixed with oil of myrrh, and the red Gilli-flower
Called Cataputia; and flowers of Rouistico;
Makes the best muta, or dye of the whole world.

TAY. Dear Madame, will you let us be familiar?


WIT. Your Ladyships servant.


MER* How do you like her.


FIT. Admirable!
He is jealous about his ring, and Mere-craft delivers it. But, yet, I cannot
see the ring.

PVG. Sir.


MER* I must
Deliver it, or mar all. This foole's so jealous.
Madame -- Sir, wear this ring, and pray you take knowledge,
'Twas sent you by his wife. And give her thanks,
Do not you dwindle, Sir, bear up.

PVG. I thank you, Sir,

TAY. But for the manner of Spain! Sweet, Madame, let us
Be bold, now we are in: Are all the Ladies,
There, in the fashion?

WIT. None but Grandee's, Madame,
OF the clasped train, which may be worn at length, too,
Or thus, upon my arm.

TAY. And do they wear
Cioppino's all?

WIT. If they be dressed in punto, Madame.


EIT. Guilt as those are? madame?


WIT. Of Goldsmiths work, madame*
And set with diamants: and their Spanish pumps
Of perfumed leather.

TAI. I should think it hard
To go in 'hem* madame.

WIT. At the first, it is, madame.


TAI. Do you never fall in 'hem?


WIT. Never.


EI. I swear, I should
Six times an hour.

WIT. But you have men at hand, still,
To help you, if you fall?

EIT. Only one, madame,
The Guardo-duennas, such a little old man,
As this.

EIT. Alas! he can do nothing! this!


WIT. I Will tell you, madame, I saw in the Court of Spain once,
A Lady fall in the Kings sight, along.
And there she lay, flat spread, as an Vmbrella,
Her hoope here cracked; no man durst reach a hand
To help her, till the Guarda-duenn'as came,
Who is the person onel'allow'd to touch
A Lady there: and he but by this finger.

EIT. Have they no servants, madame, there? nor friends?


WIT. An Escudero, or so madame, that wayts
Upon 'hem in another Coach, at distance,
And when they walk, or dance, holds by a hand-kercher,
Never presumes to touch 'hem.

EIT. This's sciruy!
And a forced gravity! I do not like it.
I like our own much better.

TAY. It Is more French,
And Courtly ours.

EIT. And tastes more liberty.
We may have our doozen of visiters, at once,
Make love t'vs.

TAY. And before our husbands?


EIT. Husband?
As I am honest, Tayle-bush I do think
If no body should love me, but my poor husband,
I should e'n hang my self.

TAY. Fortune forbid, wench:
So fair a neck should have so foul a neck-lace,

EIT. It Is true, as I am handsome!


WIT. I received, Lady,
A token from you, which I would not be
Rude to refuse, being your first remembrance.

(FIT. O, I am satisfied now!


MER. Do you see it, Sir.)


WIT. But since you come, to know me, nearer, Lady,
I Will beg the honor, you will wear it for me,
It must be so.

Mrs. FIT. Sure I have heard this tongue. Wittipol gives (...) Mistress
Fitz-dottrel. Mere-craft murmures, He is satisfied, now he sees it.



MER. What do you mean, Sr?


WIT. Would you ha'me mercenary?
We'll recompense it anon, in somewhat else,

FIT. I do not love to be gulled, though in a toy.
Wife, do you hear? yo' are come into the Schole, wife,
Where you may learn, I do perceive it, any thing!
How to be fine, or fair, or great, or proud,
Or what you will, indeed, wife; here it is taught.
And I am glad on it, that you may not say,
Another day, when honors come upon you,
You wanted means. I have done my parts: been,
He vpbraids her, with his Bill of costs.
To day, at fifty pound charge, first, for a ring,
To get you entered. Then left my new Play,
To wait upon you, here, to see it confirmed.
That I may say, both to mine own eyes, and ears,
Senses, you are my witness, sha' has inioy'd
All helps that could be had, for love, or money --

Mrs. FIT. To make a fool of her.


FIT. Wife, that is your malice,
The wickedness of you nature to interpret
Your husbands kindesse thus. But I Will not leave;
Still to do good, for your deprau'd affections:
Intend it. Bend this stubborn will; be great.

TAY. Good Madame, whom do they use in messages?


WI. They commonly use their slaves, Madame.


TAI. And does your Ladyship.
Think that so good, Madame?

WIT. no, indeed, Madame; I,
Therein prefer the fashion of England far,
Of your young delicate Page, or discreet Usher,

FIT. And I go with your Ladyship, in opinion,
Directly for your Gentleman-usher,
There Is not a finer Officer* goes on ground.

WIT. If he be made and broken to his place, once.


FIT. Nay, so I presuppose him.


WIT. And they are fitter
Managers too, Sir, but I would have 'hem called
Our Escudero's.

FIT. Good.


WIT. Say, I should send
To your Ladyship, who (I presume) has gathered
All the dear secrets, to know how to make
Pastillos of the Duchess of Braganza,
Coquettas, Almoiauana's, Mantecada's,
Alcoreas, Mustaccioli; or say it were
The Peladore of Isabella, or balls
Against the itch, or aqua nanfa, or oil
Of lessamine for gloves, of the Marquess Muja;
Or for the head, and hair: why, these are offices

FIT. Fit for a gentleman, not a slave. They only
Might ask for your piueti, Spanish-cole,
To burn, and sweeten a room: but the Arcana
Of Ladies Cabinets --

FIT. Should be else where trusted.
He enters himself with the Lady's
Yo'are much about the truth. Sweet honored Ladies,
Let me fall in wi'you. I'ha' my female wit,
As well as my male. And I do know what suits
A Lady of spirit, or a woman of fashion!

WIT. And you would have your wife such.


FIT. Yes, Madame, aerie,
Light; not to plain dishonesty, I mean:
But, somewhat of this side.

WIT. I take you, Sir.
H'has reason Ladies. I Will not give this rush
For any Lady, that cannot be honest
Within a thread.

TAY. Yes, Madame, and yet venture
As far for the other, in her Fame --

WIT. As can be;
Coach it to Pimlico; dance the Saraband;
Hear, and talk bawdy; laugh as loud, as a larum;
Squeake, spring, do any thing.

EIT. In young company, Madame.


TAY. Or before gallants. If they be brave, or Lords,
A woman is engaged.

FIT. I say so, Ladies,
It is ciuility to deny us nothing.

PVG. You talk of a University! why, The Devil admires him.
Hell is
A Grammar-schoole to this!

EIT. But then,
She must not lose a look on stuffes, or cloth, Madame.

TAY. Nor no course fellow.


WIT. She must be guided, Madame
By the clothes he wears, and company he is in;
Whom to salute, how far --

FIT. I have told her this.
And how that baw^ry too, vpo' the point,
Is (in it self) as civil a discourse --

WIT* As any other affayre of flesh, what ever.


FIT. But she will never be capable, she is not
So much as coming, Madame; I know not how
She lo^es all her opportunities
With hoping to be forced. I'haue entertained
A gentleman, a younger brother, here,
Whom I would feign breed up, her Escudero, He shows his Pug.
Against some expectation's that I have,
And she will not countenance him.

WIT. What Is his name?


FIT. Devil, of Darbi-shire.


EIT. Bless us from him!


TAY. Devil?
Call him De uile, sweet Madame.

Mrs. FI What you please, Ladies.


TAY. De-uile's a prettier name!


EIT. And sounds, me thinks,
As it came in with the Conqueror --

MAN. Over smocks!
What things they are? That nature should be at leisure
Ever to make 'hem! my woing is at an end. Manly goes out with indignation.

WIT. What can he do?


EIT. Let Us hear him.


TAY. Can he manage?


FIT. Please you to try him, Ladies. Stand forth, Devil.


PVG. Was all this but the preface to my torment?


FIT. Come, let their Ladyships see your honors.


EIT. O,
He makes a wicked leg.

TAY. As ever I saw!


WIT. Fit for a Devil.


TAY. Good Madame, call him De-uile.


WIT. De-uile, They begin their Catechism. what property is there most required
IN your conceit, now, in the Escudero?

FIT. Why do you not speak?


PVG. A settled discreet pase, Madame.


WIT. I think, a barren head, Sir, Mountaine-like,
To be exposed to the cruelty of weathers --

FIT. I, for his Valley is beneath the waste, Madame,
And to be fruitful there, it is sufficient.
Dullness upon you! Could not you hit this?

PVG. Good Sir --

WIT. He then had had no barren head. He strikes him.
You daw him too much, in troth, Sir.

FIT. I must walk
With the French stick, like an old vierger for you, The Devil prays.

PVG. O, Chief, call me to Hell again, and free me.


FIT. Do you murmur now?


PVG. Not I, Sr.


WIT. What do you take
M^. Deuile, the height of your employment,
In the true perfect Escudero?

FIT. When?
What do you answer?

PVG. To be able, Madame,
First to enquire, then report the working,
Of any Ladies physic, in sweet phrase,

WIT. Yes, that is an act of elegance, and importance.
But what above?

FIT. O, that I had a goad for him.


PVG. To find out a good Corne-cutter.


TAY. Out on him!


EIT. Most barbarous!


FIT. Why did you do this, now?
Of purpose to discredit me? you damned Devil.

PVG. Sure, if I be not yet, I shall be. All
My days in Hell, were holy days to this!

TAY. It Is labor lost, Madame?


EIT. H'is a dull fellow
Of no capacity!

TAI Of no discourse!
O, if my Ambler had been here!

EIT. I, Madame;
You talk of a man, where is there such another?

WIT. Mr. Deuile, put case, one of my Ladies, here,
Had a fine brach: and would employ you forth
To treat 'bout a convenient match for her.
What would you observe?

PVG. The color, and the size, Madame.


WIT. And nothing else?


FIT. The Moon, you calfe, the Moon!


WIT. I, and the Sign.


TAI. Yes, and receipts for pronenesse.


WIT. Then when the Puppies came, what would you do?


PVG. Get their natiuities cast!


WIT. This's well. What more?


PVG. Consult the Almanack-man which would be least?
Which cleaneliest?

WIT. And which silentest? This's well, madame!


WIT. And while she were with puppy?


PVG. Walk her out,
And air her every morning!

WIT. Very good!
And be industrious to kill her fleas?

PVG. Yes!


WIT. He will make a pretty proficient.


PVG. Who,
Coming from Hell, could look for such Catechizing?
The Devil is an Ass. I do acknowledge it.

FIT. Fitz-dottrel admires Wittipol. The top of woman! All her sex in abstract!
I love her, to each syllable, falls from her.

TAI. Good madame give me leave to go aside with him!
And try him a little!

WIT. Do, and I Will withdraw, Madame,
The Devil prays again. With this fair Lady: read to her, the while.

TAI. Come, Sr.


PVG. Dear Chief, relieve me, or I perish.


WIT. Lady, we'll follow. You are not jealous Sir?


FIT He gives his wife to him, taking him to be a Lady. O, madame! you shall
see. Stay wife, behold,
I give her up here, absolutely, to you,
She is your own. Do with her what you will!
Melt, cast, and form her as you shall think good!
Set any stamp on! I Will receive her from you
As a new thing, by your own standard!

WIT. Well, Sir!


ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. V.
MERE-CRAFT. FITZ-DOTTREL. PIT-FAL. EVER-ILL. PLVTARCHVS. But what have you done
in your Dependence, since?

FIT. O, it goes on, I met your Cousin, the Master --

MER. You did not acquaint him, Sr?


FIT. Faith, but I did, Sr.
And upon better thought, not without reason!
He being chief Officer, might ha'tane it ill, else,
As a Contempt against his Place, and that
In time Sir, ha'drawne on another Dependence.
No, I did find him in good terms, and ready
To do me any service.

MER. So he said, to you?
But Sr, you do not know him.

FIT. Why, I presumed
Because this business of my wives, required me,
I could not have done better: And he told
Me, that he would go presently to your Council,
A Knight, here, in the Lane --

MER. Yes, Justice Either-side.


FIT: And get the Feoffment drawn, with a letter of Attorney,
For liuerie and seisen!

MER. That I knowe's the course.
But Sir, you mean not to make him Feoffee?

FIT. Nay, that I Will pause on!


MER. How now little Pit-fall.


PIT. Your Cousin Master Euer-ill, would come in --
But he would know if Master Manly were here.

MER. No, tell him, if he were, I ha'made his peace! Mere-craft whispers
against him.
He Is one, Sir, has no State, and a man knows not,
How such a trust may tempt him.

FIT. I conceive you.


EVE. Sr. this same deed is done here.


MER. Pretty Plutarchus?
Art thou come with it? and has Sir Paul viewed it?

PLV. His hand is to the draught.


MER. Will you step in, Sr.
And read it?

FIT. Yes.


EVE. I pray you a word wi'you. Eueril whispers against Mere-craft.
Sir Paul Eitherside willed me gi' you caution,
Whom you did make Feoffee: for it is the trust
O'your whole State: and though my Cousin here
Be a worthy Gentleman, yet his valor has
At the tall board bin questioned; and we hold
Any man so impeached, of doubtful honesty!
I will not justify this; but give it you
To make your profit of it: if you utter it,
I can forswear it!

FIT. I believe you, and thank you, Sir.


ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. VI.
VVITTIPOL. Mistress FITZ-DOTTREL. MANLY. MERE-CRAFT. BE not afraid, sweet
Lady: yo' are trusted
To love, not violence here; I am no rauisher,
But one, whom you, by your fair trust again,
May of a servant make a most true friend.

Mrs. FI. And such a one I need, but not this way:
Sir, I confess me to you, the mere manner
Of your attempting me, this morning took me,
And I did hold m'inuention, and my manners,
Were both engaged, to give it a requital;
But not unto your ends: my hope was then,
(Though interrrupted, ere it could be vtter'd)
That whom I found the Master of such language,
That brain and spirit, for such an enterprise,
Could not, but if those succors were demanded
To a right use, employ them virtuously!
And make that profit of his noble parts,
Which they would yield. Sr, you have now the ground,
To exercise them in: I am a woman;
That cannot speak more wretchedness of my self,
Then you can read; matched to a mass of folly;
That every day makes haste to his own ruin;
The wealthy portion, that I brought him, spent*
And (through my friends neglect) no ioynture made me.
My fortunes standing in this precipice,
It Is Counsel that I want, and honest aides:
And in this name, I need you, for a friend!
Never in any other; for his ill,
Must not make me, Sr, worse.

MAN. O friend! forsake not
Manly, concealed this while, shows himself. The brave occasion, virtue offers
you,
To keep you innocent: I have feared for both;
And watched you, to prevent the ill I feared.
But, since the weaker side has so assured me,
Let not the stronger fall by his own vice,
Or be the less a friend, cause virtue needs him.

WIT. Virtue shall never ask my succors twice;
Most friend, most man; your Counsels are commands:
Lady, I can love goodness in you, more
Then I did Beauty; and do here entitle
Your virtue, to the power, upon a life
You shall engage in any fruitful service,
Even to forfeit.

MER. Madame: Do you hear, Sir,
We have another leg-strain'd, for this Dottrel. Mere-craft takes Wittipol
aside, and moves a project for himself.
He' has a quarrel to carry, and has caused
A deed of Feoffment, of his whole estate
To be drawn yonder; h'ha'st within: And you,
Only, he means to make Feoffee. H'is fallen
So desperately enamored on you, and talks
Most like a madman: you did never hear
A Phre^t^^^ so in love with his own favor!
Now, you do know, it is of no validity
In your name, as you stand; Therefore advise him
To put in me. (h'is come here:) You shall share Sir.

ACT. IV. SCENE. VIJ.
VVITTIPOL. Mistress FITZ-DOTTREL. MANLY. MERE-CRAFT. FITZ-DOTTRELL. EVERILL.
PLVTARCHVS. FIT. Madame, I have a suit to you; and aforehand,
I do bespeake you; you must not deny me,
I will be granted.

WIT. Sir, I must know it, though.


FIT. No Lady; you must not know it: yet, you must too.
For the trust of it, and the fame indeed,
Which else were lost me. I would use your name,
But in a Feoffment: make my whole estate
Over unto you: a trifle, a thing of nothing,
Some eighteen hundred.

Wit. Alas! I understand not
Those things Sir. I am a woman, and most loath,
To embarque my self --

FIT. You will not slight me, Madame?


WIT. Nor you will not quarrel me?


FIT. No, sweet Madame, I have
Already a dependence; for which cause
I do this: let me put you in, dear Madame,
I may be fairly killed.

WIT. You have your friends, Sir, He hopes to be the man.

About you here, for choice.

EVE. She tells you right, Sir.


FIT. Death, if she do, what do I care for that?
Say, I would have her tell me wrong.

WIT. Why, Sir,
If for the trust, you will let me have the honor
To name you one.

FIT. Nay, you do me the honor, Madame:
She designs Manly.
Who is it?

WIT. This Gentleman:

FIT. O, no, sweet Madame,
^^'is friend to him, with whom I have the dependence.

WIT. Who might he be?


FIT. One Wittipol: do you know him?


WIT. Alas Sir, he, a toy: This Gentleman
A friend to him? no more then I am Sir!

FIT. But will your Ladyship undertake that, Madame?


WIT. Yes, and what else, for him, you will engage me.


FIT. What is his name?


WIT. His name is Eustace Manly.


FIT. Whence does he write himself?


WIT. of Middle-sex, Esquire.


FIT. Say nothing, Madame. Clerk, come hither
Write Eustace Manly, Squire of Middle-sex.

MER. What have you done, Sir?


WIT. Named a gentleman,
That I Will be answerable for, to you, Sir.
Had I named you, it might have been suspected:
This way, it is safe.

FIT. Come Gentlemen, your hands,
Eueril applaudes it.
For witness.

MAN. What is this?


EVE. You have made Election
Of a most worthy Gentleman!

MAN. Would one of worth
Had spoke it: whence it comes, it is
Rather a shame to me, then a praise.

EVE. Sir, I will give you any Satisfaction.


MAN. Be silent then: "falsehood commends not truth.


PLV. You do deliver this, Sir, as your deed.
To the use of Mr. Manly?

FIT. Yes: and Sir --
When did you see young Wittipol? I am ready,
For process now; Sir, this is Publication.
He shall hear from me, he would needs be courting
My wife, Sir.

MAN. Yes: So witnesses his Cloak there.


FIT. Fitz-dottrel is suspicious of Manly still.
Nay good Sir, -- Madame, you did undertake --

WIT. What?


FIT. That he was not Wittipols friend.


WIT. I hear
Sr. no confession of it.

FIT. O she know's not;
Now I remember, Madame! This young Wittipol,
Would have debauched my wife, and made me Cuckold,
Through a casement; he did fly her home
To mine own window: but I think I sou't him,
And raui^h'd her away, out of his pownces.
I have sworn to ha'him by the ears: I fear
The toy, wi' not do me right.

WIT. No? that were pity!
What right do you ask, Sir? Here he is will do it you?

FIT. Wittipol discouers himself. Ha? Wittipol?


WIT. I Sir, no more Lady now,
Not Spaniard!

MAN. No indeed, it is Wittipol.


FIT. Am I the thing I feared?


WIT. A Cuckold? No Sir,
But you were late in possibility,
I Will tell you so much.

MAN. But your wife's too virtuous!


WIT. VVee'll see her Sir, at home, and leave you here,
To be made Duke of Shore-ditch with a project.

FIT. Thieves, rauishers.


WIT. Cry but another note, Sir,
I Will mar the tune, of your pipe!

FIT. Gi'me my deed, then. He would have his (...) again.



WIT. Neither: that shall be kept for your wives good,
Who will know, better how to use it.

FIT. Have
To feast you with my land?

WIT. Sir, be you quiet,
Or I shall gag you, ere I go, consult
Your Master of dependances; how to make this
A second business, you have time Sir.

FIT^ Oh!
What will the ghost of my wise Grandfather, VVitipol bafflees him, and goes
out
My learned Father, with my worshipful Mother,
Think of me now, that left me in this world
In state to be their Heir? that am become
A Cuckold, and an Ass, and my wives Ward;
Likely to loose my land; have my throat cut:
All, by her practice!

MER. Sir, we are all abused!


FIT. And be so still! Who hinders you, I pray you,
Let me alone, I would enjoy my self,
And be the Duke of Drowned Land, you have made me.

MER. Sir, we must play an after-game of this

FIT. But I am not in case to be a Gam-ster:
I tell you once again --

MER You must be ruled
And take some counsel.

FIT. Sir, I do hate counsel,
As I do hate my wife, my wicked wife!

MER. But we may think how to recover all:
If you will act.

FIT. I will not think; nor act;
Nor yet recover; do not talk to me?
I Will run out of my wits, rather then hear;
I will be what I am, Fabian Fitz-Dottrel,
Though all the world say nay to it.

MER. Let Us follow him.


ACT. V. SCENE. I.
AMBLER. PITFALL. MERE-CRAFT. But has my Lady mist me?


PIT. Beyond telling!
Here has been that infinity of strangers!
And then she would have had you, to have sampled you
With one within, that they are now a teaching;
And does pretend to your rank.

AMB. Good fellow Pit-fall,
Tell Mr. Mere-craft, I entreat a word with him.
Pitfall goes out. This most unlucky accident will go near
To be the loss of my place; I am in doubt!

MER. With me? what say you Mr Ambler?


AMB. Sir,
I would beseech your worship stand between
Me, and my Ladies displeasure, for my absence.

MER. O, is that all? I warrant you.


AMB. I would tell you Sir
But how it happened.

MER. Brief, good Master Ambler,
Put your self to your rack: for I have tasque
Mere-craft seems full of business.
Of more importance.

AMB. Sir you will laugh at me!
But (so is Truth) a very friend of mine,
Finding by conference with me, that I lived
Too chaste for my complexion (and indeed
Too honest for my place, Sir) did advise me
If I did love my self (as that I do,
I must confess)

MER. Spare your Parenthesis.


AMB. To gi' my body a little euacuation --

MER. Well, and you went to a whore?


AMB. No, Sr. I durst not
(For fear it might arrive at some body's ear,
It should not) trust my self to a common house;
Ambler tells this with extraordinary speed. But got the Gentlewoman to go with
me,
And carry her bedding to a Conduit-head,
Hard by the place toward Tyborne, which they call
My L. Majors Banqueting House. Now Sir, This morning
Was Execution; and I never dreamed on it,
Till I heard the noise of the people, and the horses;
And neither I* nor the poor Gentlewoman
Durst stir, till all was done and past: so that
IN the Interim, we fell a sleep again. He stags

MER. Nay, if you fall, from your gallop, I am gone Sr.


AMB. But, when I waked, to put on my clothes, a suit,
I made new for the action, it was gone,
And all my money, with my purse, my seals,
My hard-wax, and my table-bookes, my studies,
And a fine new devise, I had to carry
My pen, and ink, my ciuet, and my tooth-picks,
All under one. But, that which greiu'd me, was
The Gentlewomans shoes (with a pair of roses,
And garters, I had given her for the business)
So as that made us stay, till it was dark.
For I was feign to lend her mine, and walk
In a rug, by her, barefoote, to Saint Giles'es.

MER. A kind of Irish penance! Is this all, Sir?


AMB. To satisfy my Lady.


MER. I will promise you, Sr.


AMB. I have told the true Disaster.


MER. I cannot stay wi'you
Sir, to condole; but gratulate your return.

AMB. An honest gentleman, but he is never at leisure
To be himself: He has such tides of business.

ACT. V. SCENE. II.
PVG. AMBLER. O, Call me home again, dear Chief, and put me
To yoaking foxes, milking of Hee-goates,
Pounding of water in a mortar, lauing
The sea dry with a nut-shell, gathering all
The leaves are fallen this Autumn, drawing farts
Out of dead bodies, making ropes of sand,
Catching the winds together in a net,
Mustring of ants, and numbering atoms; all
That hell, and you thought exquisite torments, rather
Then stay me here, a thought more: I would sooner
Keep fleas within a circle, and be accomptant
A thousand year, which of'hem and how far
Out leaped the other, then endure a minute
Such as I have within. There is no hell
To a Lady of fashion. All your tortures there
Ambler comes in, and suruayes him Are pastimes to it. 'T would be a refreshing
For me, to be in the sire again, from hence.

AMB. This is my suite, and those the shoes and roses!


PVG. The have such impertinent vexations,
A general Council of devils could not hit --
Pug perceiues it, and starts. Ha! This is he, I took a sleep with his Wench,
And borrowed his clothes. What might I do to balke him?

AMB. Do you hear, Sr?


PVG. Answ. him but not to th'purpose

AMB. He answers quite from the purpose.
What is your name, I pray you Sir.


PVG. Is It so late Sir?


AMB. I ask not of the time, but of your name, Sir,

PVG. I thank you, Sir. Yes it dos hold Sir, certain.


AMB. Hold, Sir? What holds? I must both hold, and talk to you
About these clothes.

PVG. A very pretty lace!
But the Tailor cossend me.

AMB. No, I am cossend
By you! robbed.

PVG^ Why, when you please Sir, I am
For three penny Gleeke, your man

AMB. Pox o'your gleeke,
And three pence. Give me an answer.

PVG. Sir,
My master is the best at it.

AMB. Your master!
Who is your Master.

PVG. Let it be friday night.


AMB. What should be then?


PVG. Your best songs Thom. of Bet'lem

AMB. I think, you are he. Does he mock me trow, from purpose?
Or do ^ot I speak to him, what I mean?
Good Sir your name.

PVG. Only a couple a' Cocks Sir,
If we can get a Widgin, it is in season.

AMB. For Scepticks.
He hopes to make on of these Scipticks of me
(I think I name 'hem right) and does not fly me.
I wonder at that! it is a strange confidence!
I Will prove another way, to draw his answer.

ACT. V. SCENE. IIJ.
MERE-CRAFT. FITZ-DOTTREL* EVERILL. PVG. It is the easiest thing Sir, to be
done.
As plain, as fizzling: roll but wi' your eyes,
And foame at th'mouth. A little castle-soape
Will do it, to rub your lips: And then a nutshell,
With toe, and touch-wood in it to spit fire,
Did you never read, Sir, little Darrels tricks,
With the boy of Burton, and the 7. in Lancashire,
Summers at Nottingham? All these do teach it.
And we will give out, Sir, that your wife has bewitched you: They repair
their old plot


EVE. And practiced with those two, as Sorcerers.


MER. And ga' you potions, by which means you were
Not Compos mentis, when you made your feoffment.
There Is no recovery of your state, but this:
This, Sir, will sting.

EVE. And move in a Court of equity.


MER. For, it is more then manifest, that this was
A plot of your wives, to get your land.

FIT. I think it.


EVE. Sir it appears.


MER. Nay, and my cossen has known
These gallants in these shapes.

EVE. TO have don strange things, Sir*
One as the Lady, the other as the Squire.

MER. How, a man's honesty may be fooled! I thought him
A very Lady.

FIT. So did I: renounce me else.


MER. But this way, Sir, you will be revenged at height.


EVE. Upon 'hem all.


MER. Yes faith, and since your Wife
Has run the way of woman thus, even give her --

FIT. Lost by this hand, to me; dead to all joys
Of her dear Dottrell, I shall never pity her:
That could, pity her self.

MER. Princely resolved Sir,
And like your self still, in Potentia.

ACT. V. SCENE. IV.
MERE-CRAFT, etc. to them. GVILT-HEAD. SLEDGE-PLVTARCHVS. SERIEANTS. GVilt-head
what news.?


FIT. O Sir, my hundred pieces: Fitz-dottrel asks for his money^

Let me have them yet.

GVI. Yes Sir, officers
Arrest him.

FIT. Me?


SER. I arrest you.


SLE. Keep the peace,
I charge you gentlemen.

FIT. Arrest me? Why?


GVI. For better security, Sir. My son Plutarchus
Assures me, you are not worth a groat.

PLV. Pardon me, Father,
I said his worship had no foot of Land left:
And that I Will justify, for I writ the deed.

FIT. Have you these tricks in the city?


GVI. Yes, and more.
Arrest this gallant too, here, at my suite.

SLE. I, and at mine. Meaning Mere-craft
He owes me for his lodging
Two year and a quarter.

MER. Why M. Guilt-head, Landlord,
Thou art not mad, though thou art Constable
Puffed up with th'pride of the place? Do you hear, Sirs.
Have I deserved this from you two? for all
My pains at Court, to get you each a patent

GVI. The Project of forks
For what?


MER. Vpo' my project of the forkes,

SLE. Forkes? what be they?


MER. The laudable use of forkes,
Brought into custom here, as they are in Italy,
To th'sparing of Napkins. That, that should have made
Your bellows go at the forge, as his at the furnace.
I have procured it, have the Signet for it,
Dealt with the Linnen-drapers, on my private,
By cause, I feared, they were the likelyest ever
To stir against, to cross it: for 'twill be
A mighty sauer of Linen through the kingdom
(As that is one of my grounds, and to spare washing)
Now, on you two, had I laid all the profits.
Guilt-h^ad to have the making of all those
O^ go^d and silver, for the better personages;
And you, of those of Steel for the common sort.
And both by Pattent, I had brought you your seals in.
Sledge is brought about.

And Guilt-head comes.


But now you have prevented me, and I thank you.

SLE. Sir, I will bail you, at mine own ap-perill.


MER. Nay choose.


PLV. Do you so too, good Father.


CVI. I like the fashion of the project, well,
The forkes! It may be a lucky one! and is not
Intricate, as one would say, but fit for
Plain heads, as ours, to deal in. Do you hear
Officers, we discharge you.

MER. Why this shows
A little good nature in you, I confess,
But do not tempt your friends thus. Little Guilt-head,
Advise your sire, great Guilt-head from these courses:
And, here, to trouble a great man in reuersion,
For a matter of fifty on a false Alarm,
Away, it shows not well. Let him get the pieces
And bring 'hem. Yo'll hear more else.

PLV. Father.


ACT. V. SCENE. V.
AMBLER. To them. O Master Sledge, are you here? I have been to seek you.
You are the Constable, they say. Here Is one
That I do charge with Felony, for the suite
He wears, Sir.

MER. Who? M. Fitz-Dottrels man?
Ware what you do, M. Ambler.

AMB. Sir, these clothes
I Will swear, are mine: and the shoes the gentlewomans
I told you of: and have him before a Justice,
I will.

PVG. My master, Sir, will pass his word for me.


AMB. O, can you speak to purpose now?


FIT. Not I, Fitz-dottrel disclaimes him.

If you be such a one Sir, I will leave you
To your God fathers in Law. Let twelve men work.

PVG Do you hear Sir, pray, in private.


FIT. well, what say you?
Brief, for I have no time to loose*

PVG. Truth is, Sir,
I am the very Devil, and had leave
To take this body, I am in, to serve you:
Which was a Cutpurses, and hanged this Morning*
And it is likewise true, I stole this suite
To cl^th me with. Bu^ Sir let me not go
To prison for it. I have hitherto
Lost time, done nothing; shown, indeed, no part*
OF my Devils nature. Now, I will so help
Your malice, against these parties: so advance
The business, that you have in hand of witchcraft,
An^ your possession, as my self were in you.
Teach you ^uch tricks, to make your belly swell,
And your eyes turn, to foame, to stare, to gnash
Your teeth together, and to beat your self,
Laugh loud, and feign six voices --

FIT. Out you Rogue!
You most infernal counterfeit wretch! Auaunt!
Do you think to gull me with your* Aesops Fables?
Here take him to you, I have no part in him.

PVG. Sir.


FIT. Away, I do disclaim, I will not hear you.


MER. What said he to you, Sir?


FIT. Like a lying rascal And sends him away.
Told me he was the Devil.

MER. How! a good jest!


FIT. And that he would teach me, such fine devils tricks
For our new resolution.

EVE. OF pox on him,
'Twas excellent wisely done, Sir, not to trust him*

MER Why, if he were the Devil, we sha' not need him,
If you will be ruled. Go throw your self on a bed, Sir, Mere-craft gives the
instructions to him and the rest.

And feign you ill. We Will not be seen wi' you,
Till after, that you have a fit: and all
Confirmed within. Keep you with the two Ladies
And persuade them. I Will to Justice Either-side,
And possess him with all. Trains shall seek out Ingine,
And they two fill the town with it, every cable
Is to be veer'd. We must employ out all
Our emissaries now; Sir, I will send you
Bladders and Bellows. Sir, be confident,
It Is no hard thing t'out do the Devil in:
A Boy of thirteen year old made him an Ass
But ^'toher day.

FIT. Well, I Will begin to practice,
And escape the imputation of being Cuckold,
By mine own act.

MER. yo'are right.


EVE. Come, you have put
Your self to a simple coil here, and your friends,
By dealing with new Agents, in new plots.

MER. No more of that, sweet cousin.


EVE. What had you
To do with this same Wittipol, for a Lady?

MER. Question not tha^: it is done.


EVE. You had some strain
Above E la?

MER. I had indeed.


EVE. And, now, you crack for it.


MER. Do not vpbraid me.


EVE. Come, you must be told on it;
You are so covetous, still, to embrace
More then you can, that you loose all.

MER. It Is right.
What would you more, then Guilty? Now, your succors.

ACT. V. SCENE. VJ.
SHAKLES. PVG INIQVITY. DEVIL. HEre you are lodged, Sir, you must send your
garnish,
Pug is brought to Newgate. If you will be private.

PVG. There it is, Sir, leave me.
To Newgate, brought? How is the name of Devil
Discredited in me! What a lost fiend
Shall I be, on return? My Chief will roar
^n triumph, now, that I have been on earth,
A day, and done no noted thing, but brought
That body back here, was hanged out this morning.
Enter Iniquity the Vice. Well! would it once were midnight, that I knew
My utmost. I think Time be drunk, and sleeps;
He is so still, and moves not! I do glory
Now i'my torment. Neither can I expect it,
I have it with my fact.

INI. Child of hell, be thou merry:
Put a look on, as round, boy, and red as a cherry.
Cast care at thy posternes; and firke i'thy fetters,
They are ornaments, Baby, have graced thy betters:
Look upon me, and hearken. Our Chief does salute thee,
And least the coldyron should chance to confute thee,
H' has sent thee, grant-paroll by me to stay longer
A month here on earth, against cold Child, or honger

PVG. How? longer here a month?


ING. Yes, boy, till the Session,
That so thou may have a triumphall egression.

PVG. In a cart, to be hanged.


ING. No, Child, in a Carre,
The chariot of Triumph, which most of them are.
And in the mean time, to be greazy, and bouzy,
And nasty, and filthy, and ragged and louzy,
With dam'n me, renounce me, and all the fine phrases;
That bring, unto Tiborne, the plentiful gazes.

PVG. He is a Devil! and may be our Chief!
The great Superior Devil! for his malice:
Arch-diuel! I acknowledge him. He knew
What I would suffer, when he tie'd me up thus
In a rogues body: and he has (I thank him)
His tyrannous pleasure on me, to confine me
To the unlucky carcass of a Cutpurse,
Wherein I could do nothing.

DIV. Impudent fiend,
Stop thy lewd mouth. The great Devil enters, and vpbraids him with all his
days work. Do thou not shame and tremble
To lay thine own dull damned defects upon
An innocent case, there? Why thou heavy slave!
The spirit, that did possess that fresh before
Put more true life, in a finger, and a thumb,
Then thou in the whole Mass. Yet thou rebell'st
And murmur'st? What one profer have thou made,
Wicked enough, this day, that might be called
Worthy thine own, much less the name that sent thee?
First, thou did help thy self into a beating
Promptly, and with t endangered'st too thy tongue:
A Devil, and could not keep a body entire
One day! That, for our credit. And to vindicate it,
Hinderd'st (for ought thou know) a deed of darkness:
Which was an act of that egregious folly,
As no one, to'ard the Devil, could have thought on.
This for your acting! but for suffering! why
Thou have been cheated on, with a false beard,
And a turned cloak. Faith, would your predecessor
The Cutpurse, think you, have been so? Out upon thee,
The hurt thou have don, to let men know their strength,
And that the'are able to out-doe a devil
Put in a body, will for ever be
A scarre upon our Name! whom have thou dealt with,
Woman or man, this day, but have out-gone thee
Some way, and most have proved the better fiendes?
Yet, you would be employed? Yes, hell shall make you
Provincial of the heaters! or Bawd-ledger,
For this side of the town! No doubt you will render
A rare account of things. Bane of your itch,
And scratching for employment. I Will have brimstone
To al lay it sure, and fire to sindge your nails off,
But, that I would not such a damned dishonor
Stick on our state, as that the devil were hanged;
And could not save a body, that he took
From Tyborne, but it must come thither again: Iniquity takes him on his back.
You should even ride. But, up away with him --

INI. Mount, dearling of darkness, my shoulders are broad:
He that caries the fiend, is sure of his load.
The Devil was wont to carry away the evil;
But, now, the Evil out-carries the Devil.

MER. Sir, They had given him potions,
That did enamour him on the counterfeit Lady --

EVE. Just to the time o'deliuery of the deed --

MER. And then the witchcraft 'gan't' appear, for straight
He fell into his fit.

EVE. Of rage at first, Sir,
Which since has so increased.

TAY. Good Sr. Poule, see him,
And punish the impostors.

POV. Therefore I come, Madame.


EIT. Let Mr Etherside alone, Madame.


POV. Do you hear?
Call in the Constable, I will have him by:
H'is the Kings Officer! and some Citizens,
Of credit! I Will discharge my conscience clearly.

MER. Yes, Sir, and send for his wife.


EVE. And the two Sorcerers,
By any means!

TAY. I thought one a true Lady,
I should be sworn. So did you, Eyther-si^^?

EIT. Yes, by that light, would I might ^e'r stir else, Tailbush.


TAY. And the other a civil Gentleman.


EVE. But* Madame,
You know what I told your Ladyship.

TAY. I now see it:
I was providing of a banquet for 'hem.
After I had done instructing of the fellow
De^uile, the Gentleman's man

MER. Who Is found a thief, Madam.
And to have robbed your Usher, Master Ambler,
This morning.

TAY. How?


MER. I'^l tell you more, anon. He begins his fit.


FIT. Gi me some garlic, garlic, garlic, garlic.


MER. Hark the poor Gentleman, how he is tormented!


FIT. My wife is a whore, I Will kiss her no more: and why?
Ma'st not thou be a Cuckold, as well as I?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, etc.

POV. That is the Devil speaks, and laughes in him.


MER. Do you think so, Sr.


POV. I discharge my conscience. The Justice interpret all:



FIT. And is not the Devil good company? Yes, wis.


EVE. How he changes, Sir, his voice!


FIT. And a Cuckold is
Where ere he put his head, with a a Wa^ion,
If his horns be forth, the Devils companion!
Look, look, look, else.

MER. How he foames!


EVE. And swells!


TAY. O, me! what is that there, rises in his belly!


EIT. A strange thing! hold it down:

TRA. PIT. We cannot, Madam.


POV. It Is too apparent this!


FIT. Wittipol, Wittipol.


WIT. How now, what play have we here.


MAN. What fine, new matters? Wittipol, and Manly* and Mistr. Fitz-dottrel
enter.


WIT. The Cockscomb, and the Couerlet.


MER. O strange impude^ce!
That these should come to face their sin!

EVE: And outface
Justice, they are the parties, Sir.

POV. Say nothing.


MER. Did you mark, Sir, upon their coming in,
How he called Wittipol.

EVE. And never saw 'hem.


POV. I warrant you did I, let 'hem play a while.


FIT. Buz, buz, buz, buz.


TAY. Less poor Gentleman!
How he is tortured!

Mrs. FI. Fie, Master Fitz-dottrel!
What do you mean to counterfeit thus?

FIT: O, o, His wife goes to him.
She comes with a needle, and thrusts it in,
She pulls out that, and she puts in a pin,
And now, and now, I do not know how, nor where,
But she pricks me here, and she pricks me there: oh, oh:

POV. Woman forbear.


WIT. What, Sr?


POV. A practice soul
For one so fair:

WIT. Has this, then, credit with you?


MAN. Do you believe in it?


POV. Gentlemen, I Will discharge
My conscience: It Is a clear conspiracy!
A dark, and devilish practice! I detest it!

WIT. The Justice sure will prove to be the merrier!


MAN. This is most strange, Sir.


POV. Come not to confront
Authority with insolence: I tell you,
I do detest it. Here comes the Kings Constable,
And with him a right worshipful Commoner;
My good friend, Master Guilt-head! I am glad
I can before such witnesses, profess
My conscience, and my detestation of it.
Horible! most vnaturall! Abominable!

EVE. They whisper him. You do not tumble enough.


MER. Wallow, gnash:

TAY. O, how he is vexed!


POV. It Is too manifest.


EVE. Give him more soap to foame with, now lie still.


MER. And give soape to act with. And act a little.


TAY. What does he now, Sr.


POV. Show
The taking of Tobacco, with which the Devil
Is so delighted.

FIT. Hum!


POV. And calls for Hum.
You takers of strong Waters, and Tobacco,
Mark this.

FIT. Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, etc.


POV. That Is Starch! the Devils Idol of that color.
He ratifies it, clapping of his hands.
The proofs are pregnant.

GVI. How the Devil can act!


POV. He is the Master of Players! Master Guilt-head,
And Poets, too! you heard him talk in rhyme!
I had forgot to observe it to you, ere while!

TAY. Sir Poule inter^rets Fig^^m a ^^^lers game. See, he spits fire.


POV. O no, he plays at Figgum,
The Devil is the Author of wicked Figgum --

MAN. Why speak you not unto him?


WIT. If I had
All innocence of man to be endangered,
And he could save, or ruin it: I Would not breath
A syllable in request, to such a fellow,
I Would rather fall.

FIT. o they whisper, they whisper, whisper. etc.
We shall have more, of Devils a score,
To come to dinner, in me the sinner.

EYT. Alas, poor Gentleman!


POV. Put 'hem asunder.
Keep 'hem one from the other.

MAN. Are you phrenticke, Sir,
Or what grave dotage moves you, to take part
With so much villainy? we are not afraid
Either of law, or trial; let us be
Examined what our ends were, what the means,
To work by; and possibility of those means.
Do not conclude against us, ere you hear us.

POV. I will not hear you, yet I will conclude
Out of the circumstances.

MAN. Will you so, Sir?


POV. Yes, they are palpable:

MAN. Not as your folly:

POV: I will discharge my conscience, and do all
To the Meridian of Justice:

GVI. You do well, Sir:

F^T. Provide me to eat, three or four dishes o'good meat,
I Will feast them, and their trains, a Justice head and brains
Shall be the first.

POV. The Devil loves not Justice,
There you may see.

FIT. A spare-rib of my wife,
And a whores purt'nance! a Guilt-head whole.

POV. Be not you troubled, Sir, the Devil speaks it.


FIT. Yes, wis, Knight, shite, Poule, Ioule, owl, foul, troule, boule.


POV. Crambe, another of the Diuell's games!


MER. Speak, Sir, some Greek, if you can. Is not the Justice
A solemn gamester?

EVE. Peace.


FIT. (...),
(...),
(...).

POV. He curses
In Greek I think.

EVE. Your Spanish, that I taught you.


FIT. Quebremos el ojo de burlas,

EVE. How? your rest --
Let Us break his neck in jest, the Devil says,

FIT. Di gratia, Signor miose hau^te denari fatamene part.


MER. What, would the Devil borrow money?


FIT. Ouy,
Ouy Monsieur, un pauure Diable! Diablet in!

POV. It is the devil, by his several languages.


SHA. Where Is St. Poule Ether-side?


POV. Here, what is the matter? Enter the Keeper of Newgate.

SHA. O! such an accident fallen out at Newgate, Sir:
A great piece of the prison is ^ent down!
The Devil has been there, Sir, in the body --
Of the young Cutpurse, was hanged out this morning,
But, in new clothes, Sir, every one of us know him.
These things were found in his pocket.

AMB. Those are mine, Sr.


SHA. I think he was committed on your charge, Sir.
For a new felony

AMB* Yes.


SHA. He Is gone, Sir, now,
And left us the dead body. But withal, Sir,
Such an infernal stincke, and steame behind,
You cannot see St. Pulchars Steeple, yet.
They smell't as far as Ware, as the wind lies,
By this time, sure.

FIT. Is this upon your credit, friend? Fitz-dottrel leaves counterfaiting.


SHA. Sir, you may see, and satisfy your self.


FIT. Nay, then, it is time to leave off counterfeiting.
Sir I am not bewitched, nor have a Devil:
No more then you. I do defy him, I,
And did abuse you. These two Gentlemen
Put me upon it. (I have faith against him)
They taught me all my tricks. I will tell truth,
And shame the Feind. See, here, Sir, are my bellows,
And my false belly, and my Mouse, and all
That should have come forth?

MAN. Sir, are not you ashamed
Now of your solemn, serious vanity?

POV. I will make honorable amends to truth.


FIT. And so will I. But these are Coozeners, still;
And have my land, as plotters, with my wife:
Who, though she be not a witch, is worse, a whore.

MAN. Sir, you belie her. She is chaste, and virtuous,
And we are honest. I do know no glory
A man should hope, by venting his own follyes,
But you will still be an Ass, in spite of providence.
Please you go in, Sir, and hear truths, then judge 'hem:
And make amends for your late rashness; when,
You shall but hear the pains and care was taken,
To save this fool from ruin (his Grace of Drowned land)

FIT. My land is drowned indeed --

POV. Peace.


MAN. And how much
His modest, and too worthy wife has suffered
By mis-construction, from him, you will blush,
First, for your own belief, more for his actions!
His land is his: and never, by my friend,
Or by my self, meant to another use,
But for her succors, who has equal right.
If any other had worse counsels in it,
(I know I speak to those can apprehend me)
Let 'hem repent 'hem, and be not detected.
It is not manly to take joy, or pride
In humane errors (we do all ill things,
They do 'hem worst that love 'hem, and dwell there,
Till the plague comes) The few that have the seeds
Of goodness left, will sooner make their way
To a true life, by shame, then punishment.

The End.
The Epilogue.
THus, the Proiecter, here, is ouer-throwne.
But I have now a Project of mine own,
If it may pass: that no man would inuit
The Poet from us, to sup forth to night,
If the play please. If it displeasant be,
We do presume, that no man will: nor we.

THE INDVCTION.
The PROLOGVE enters. After him, Gossip MIRTH. Gos. TATLE. Gos. EXPECTATION.
and Gossip CENSVRE. 4. Gentlewomen LADY-like attyred. PROLOGVE. FOr your own
sake, not ours --


MIRTH. Come Gossip, be not ashamed. The Play is the Staple of News, and you
are the Mistress, and Lady of Tatle, let us have your opinion of it: Do you
hear Gentleman? what are you? Gentleman-usher to the Play? pray you help us
to some stools here.


PROLOGVE. Where? of the Stage, Ladies?


MIRTH. Yes, of the Stage; we are persons of quality, I assure you, and women
of fashion; and come to see, and to be seen: My Gossip Tatle here, and Gossip
Expectation, and my Gossip Censure, and I am Mirth, the daughter of Christmas,
and spirit of Shrouetide. They say, It Is merry when Gossips meet, I hope your
Play will be a merry one!


PROLOGVE Or you will make it such, Ladies. Bring a form here, but what will
the Noblemen think, or the grave Wits here, to see you seated on the bench
thus?


MIRTH. Why, what should they think? but that they had Mothers, as we had, and
those Mothers had Gossips (if their children were christened) as we are, and
such as had a longing to see Plays, and sit upon them, as we do, and
arraigne both them, and their Poets.


PROLOGVE. O! Is that your purpose? Why, Mrs. Mirth, and Madame Tatle, enjoy
your delights freely.


TATLE. Look your News be new, and fresh, Mr. Prologue, and untainted, I
shall find them else, if they be stale, or flye-blowne, quickly!


PROLOGVE. We ask no favor from you, only we would entreat of Madame
Expectation --


EXPECTATION. What, Mr. Prologue?


PROLOGVE. That your Ladi-ship would expect no more then you understand.


EXPECTATION. Sir, I can expect enough!


PROLOGVE. I fear too much, Lady, and teach others to do the like?


EXPECTATION. I can do that too, if I have cause.


PROLOGVE. Cry you mercy, you never did wrong, but with just cause. What Is
this, Lady?


MIRTH. Curiosity, my Lady Censure.


PROLOGVE. O Curiosity! you come to see, who wears the new suit to day? whose
clothes are best penned, what ever the part be? which Actor has the best leg
and foot? what King plays without cuffes? and his Queen without gloves? who
rides post in stockings? and daunces in boots?


CENSVRE. Yes, and which amorous Prince makes love in drink, or does ouer-act
prodigiously in beaten satin, and, having got the trick on it, will be
monstrous still, in despite of Counsel!


BOOK-HOLDER. The Tiremen enter to mend the lights. Mend your lights,
Gentlemen. Master Prologue, begin.


TATLE. Ay me!


EXPECTATION, Who Is that?


PROLOGVE. Nay, start not Ladies, these carry no fire-workes to fright you, but
a Torch in their hands, to give light to the business. The truth is, there are
a set of gamesters within, in tra^^ll of a thing called a Play, and would feign
be deliuer^d of it: and they have entreated me to be their Man- Midwife, the
Prologue; for they are like to have a hard labor on it.


TATLE. Then the Poet has abused himself, like an Ass, as he is.


MIRTH. No, his Actors will abuse him enough, or I am deceived. Yonder he is
within (I was in the Tiring-house a while to see the Actors dressed) rolling
himself up and down like a tun, in the midst of 'hem, and spurges, never did
vessel of wort, or wine work so! His sweating put me in mind of a good
Shrouing dish (and I believe would be taken up for a service of state
somewhere, an't were known) a stewed Poet* He does sit like an vnbrac'd Drum
with one of his heads beaten out: For, that you must note, a Poet has two
heads, as a Drum has, one for making, the other repeating, and his repeating
head is all to pieces: they may gather it up in the tiring-house; for he has
torn the book in a Poetical fury, and put himself to silence in dead Sack,
which, were there no other vexation, were sufficient to make him the most
miserable Emblem of patience.


CENSVRE. The Prologue, peace.


THE PROLOGVE FOR THE STAGE.
FOr your own sakes, not his, he bad me say,
Would you were come to hear, not see a Play.
Though we his Actors must provide for those,
Who are our guests, here, in the way of shows,
The maker has not so; he would have you wise,
Much ^ather by your ears, then by your eyes:
And prays you will not preiudge his Play for ill,
Because you mark it not, and sit not still;
But have a longing to salute, or talk
With such a female, and from her to walk
With your discourse, to what is done, and where,
How, and by whom, in all the town; but here.
Alas! what is it to his Scene, to know
How many Coaches in Hide-parke did show
Last spring, what fare to day at Medleyes was,
If Dunstan, or the Phoenix best wine has?
They are things -- But yet, the Stage might stand as well,
If it did neither hear these things, nor tell.
Great noble wits, be good unto your selves,
And make a difference 'twixt Poetique elues,
And Poets: All that dable in the ink,
And defile quills, are not those few, can think,
Conceive, express, and steer the souls of men,
As with a rudder, round thus, with their pen.
He must be one that can instruct your youth,
And keep your Acme in the state of truth,
Must enterprise this work, mark but his ways,
What flight he makes, how new; And then he says,
If that not like you, that he sends to night,
It Is you have left to judge, not he to write*
THE PROLOGVE FOR THE COURT.
A Work not smelling of the Lamp, to night,
But fitted for your Majesty's disport,
And writ to the Meridian of your Court,
We bring; and hope it may produce delight:
The rather, being offered, as a Rite
To Scholars, that can judge, and fair report
The sense they hear, above the vulgar sort
Of Nut-crackers, that only come for sight.
Wherein, although our Title, Sir, be News.
We yet adventure, here, to tell you none;
But show you common follies, and so known,
That though they are not truths, the innocent Muse
Has made so like, as Phant'sie could them state,
Or Poetry, without scandal, imitate.
THE STAPLE OF NEVVES.
ACT. I. SCENE. I.
PENI-BOY. IV. LETHER-LEGGE. GRamercie Letherleg: Get me the Spurrier, His
Shooemaker has pulled on a new pair of boots; and he walks in his Gown,
wastcoate, and trouses, expecting his Tailor.

And thou have fitted me.

LET. I Will do it presently.


P. IV. Look to me, wit, and look to my wit, Land,
That is, look on me, and with all thine eyes,
Male, Female, yea, Hermaphroditicke eyes,
And those bring all your helps, and perspicills,
To see me at best advantage, and augment
My form as I come forth, for I do feel
I will be one, worth looking after, shortly.
Now, by and by, that is shortly. He ^rawes forth his watch, and sets it on the
Table.
't strikes! One, two,
Three, four, five, six. Enough, enough, dear watch,
Thy pulse has beat enough. Now sleep, and rest;
Would thou could make the time to do so too:
I Will wind thee up no more. The hour is come
So long expected! There, there, He throws off his gown
drop my wardship,
My pupil age, and vassalage together.
And Liberty, come throw thy self about me,
In a rich suite, cloak, hat, and band, for now
I Will sue out no man's Livery, but miny own,
I stand on my own feet, so much a year,
Right, round, and sound, the Lord of mine own ground,
And (to ryme to it) threescore thousand Pound!
He goes to the door, and looks.
Not come? Not yet? Tailor thou art a vermin,
Worse then the same thou prosecut'st, and prick'st
In subtle seame -- (Go too, I say no more)
Thus to retard my longings: on the day
I do write man, to beat thee. One and twenty,
Since the clock struck, complete! and thou will feel it
Thou foolish Animal! I could pity him,
(An' I were not heartily angry with him now)
For this one piece of folly he bears about him,
To dare to tempt the Fury of an heir,
TO above two thousand a year; yet hope his custom!
Well, Mr. Fashioner, there is some must break --
A head, for this your breaking. Are you come, Sir,

ACT. II. SCENE. IJ.
FASHIONER. PENIBOY. THOMAS BARBER. HABERDASHER. GOd give your worship joy.


P. IV. What? of your staying?
And leaving me to stalk here in my trowses,
Like a tame Her'n-sew for you?

FAS. I but waited
Below, till the clock struck.

P. IV. Why, if you had come
Before a quarter, would it so have hurt you,
In reputation, to have waited here?

FAS. No, but your worship might have pleaded nonage,
If you had got 'hem on, ere I could make
Just Affidauit of the time.

P. IV. That jest
Has gained thy pardon, thou had lived, condemned
To thine own hell else, never to have wrought
Stitch more for me, or any Peniboy,
I could have hindered thee: but now thou art mine.
For one and twenty years, or for three lives,
Choose which thou will, I Will make thee a Copyholder,
He says his suit.
And thy first Bill vnquestion'd. Help me on.

FAS. Presently, Sir, I am bound unto your worship.


P. IV. Thou shall be, when I have sealed thee a Lease of my Custom.


FAS. Your worps, Barbar is without.


P. IN. Who? Thom?
Come in Thom: set thy things upon the Board
And spread thy clothes, lay all forth in procinctu,
And tell's what news?

THO. O Sir, a staple of news!
Or the New Staple, which you please.

P. IV. What Is that?


FAS. An Office, Sir, a brave young Office set up.
I had forgot to tell your worship.

P. IV. For what?


THO. To enter all the News, Sir, of the time,

FAS. And vent it as occasion serves! A place
Of huge commerce it will be!

P. IV. Pray thee peace,
I cannot abide a talking Tailor: let Thom
(He Is a Barber) by his place relate it,
What is it, an Office, Thom?

THO. Newly erected
Here in the house, almost on the same floor,
Where all the news of all sorts shall be brought,
And there be examined, and then registered,
And so be issued under the Seal of the Office,
As Staple News; no other news be current.

P. IV. Before me, thou speak of a brave business, Thom.


FAS. Nay, if you knew the brain that hatched it Sr --

P. IV. I know thee well enough: give him a loaf, Thom --
Quiet his mouth, that Oven will be venting else.
Proceed --

THO. He tells you true Sr. Mr Cymbal,
Is Master of the Office, he proiected it,
He lies here in the house: and the great rooms
He has taken for the Office, and set up
His Deskes and Classes, Tables and his Shelues,

FAS. He Is my Customer, and a Wit Sir, too.
But, h' has brave wits under him --

THO. Yes, four Emissaries,

P. IV. Emissaries? stay, there is a fine new word, Thom!
'Pray God it signify any thing, what are Emissaries?

THO. Men employed outward, that are sent abroad
To fetch in the commodity.

FAS. From all regions
Where the best news are made.

THO. Or vented forth.


FAS. By way of exchange, or trade.


P. IV. Nay, thou will speak --

FAS. My share Sr. there is enough for both.


P. IV. Go on then, He gives the Tailor leave to talk.

Speak all thou can: me thinks, the ordinaries
Should help them much.

FAS. Sir, they have ordinaries,
And extraordinaries, as many changes,
And variations, as there are points in the compass.

THO. But the 4. Cardinal Quarters --

P. IV. I, those Thom --

THO. The Court, Sir, Paul's, Exchange, and Westminster Hall.


P. IV. Who is the Chief? which has preceedencie?


THO. The governor of the Staple, Master Cymball.
He is the Chief; and after him the Emissaries:
First Emissary Court, one Master Fitton,
He Is a Ieerer too.

P. IV. What Is that?


FAS. A Wit.


THO. Or half a Wit, some of them are Halfe-wits,
Two to a Wit, there are a set of 'hem.
Then Master Ambler, Emissary Paul's,
A fine paced gentleman, as you shall see, walk
The middle I Will: And then my Froy Hans Buz,
A Dutchman; he is Emissary Exhange.

FAS. I had thought Mr. Burst the Merchant had had it.


THO. No,
He has a rupture, he has sprung a leake,
Emissarie Westminster's vndispos'd of yet;
Then the Examiner, Register, and two Clerks,
They manage all at home, and sort, and file,
And seal the news, and issue them.

P. IV. Thom, dear Thom.
What may my means do for thee, ask, and have it,
I Would feign be doing some good. It is my birthday.
And I Would do it betimes, I feel a grudging
Of bounty, and I would not long lie fallow.
I pray thee think, and speak, or wish for something.

THO. I would I had but one of the Clerks places,
I'this News Office,.

P. IV. Thou shall have it, Thom,
If silver, or gold will fetch it; what is the rate?
At what is it set in the Market?

THO. Fifty pound, Sir.


P. IV. An't were a hundred, Thom, thou shall not want it.


FAS. The Tailor leapes, and embraces him. O Noble Master!


P. IV. How now Aesops Ass!
Because I play with Thom, must I needs run
Into your rude embraces? stand you still, Sir;
Clownes fawnings, are a horses salutations.
How do thou like my suite, Thom?

THO. Mr Fashioner
Has hit your measures, Sir, h'has molded you,
And made you, as they say.

FAS. No, no, not I,
I am an Ass, old Aesops Ass.

P. IV. Nay, Fashioner,
I can do thee a good turn too, be not musty,
Though thou have molded me, as little Thom says,
He draws out his pockets. (I think thou have put me in moldy pockets.)

FAS. As good,
Right Spanish perfume, the Lady Estifania's,
They cost twelve pound a pair.

P. IV. Thy bill will say so.
I pray thee tell me, Fashioner, what Authors
Thou read'st to help thy invention? Italian prints?
Or Arras hangings? They are Tailors Libraries.

FAS. I scorn such helps.


P. IV. O, though thou art a silk-worme!
And deal'st in sattins and veluets, and rich plushes,
Thou can not spin all forms out of thy self;
They are quite other things: I think this suite
Has made me wittier, then I was.

FAS. Believe it Sir,
That clothes do much upon the wit, as weather
Does on the brain; and thence comes your proverb;
The Tailor makes the man: I speak by experience
Of my own Customers. I have had Gallants,
Both Court and Country, would have fooled you up
In a new suite, with the best wits, in being,
And kept their speed, as long as their clothes lasted
Han'some, and neat; but then as they grew out
At the elbowes again, or had a stain, or spot,
They have sunk most wretchedly.

P. IV. What thou report'st,
Is but the common calamity, and seen daily;
And therefore you 'haue another answering proverb:
A broken sleeue keeps the arm back,

FAS. It Is true, Sir.
And thence we say, that such a one plays at peepe-arme.

P. IV. Do you so? it is wittily said. I wonder, Gentlemen,
And men of means will not maintain themselves
Fresher in wit, I mean in clothes, to the highest.
For he that is out of clothes, is out o'fashion,
And out of fashion, is out of countenance,
And out of countenance, is out of Wit.
Is not Rogue Haberdasher come?

HAB. Yes, here, Sir. They are all about him, busy.
I have been without this half hour.

P IV. Give me my hat.
Put on my Girdle. Rascal, sits my Ruff well?

LIN. In print.


P. IV. Slave.


LIN. See your self.


P. IV. ^s this same hat
Of The block passant? Do not answer me,
I cannot stay for an answer. I do feel
The powers of one and twenty, like a ^ide
Flow in upon me, and perceive an Heir,
Can Conjure up all spirits in all circles,
Rogue, Rascal, Slave* give tradesmen their true names,
And they appear to 'hem pr^sently.

LIN. For profit.


P. IV. Come cast my cloak about me, I Will go see,
This Office Thom, and be trimmed afterward.
I Will put thee in possession, my prime work!
Gods so* my Spurrier! put hem on boy, quickly, His Spurrier comes in.
(...) lost my Spurs with too much speed.

ACT. I. SCENE. IIJ.
PENI-BOY, Canter. to them singing. Good morning to my Joy, My jolly Peni-boy!
The Lord, and the Prince of plenty!
I come to see what riches, Thou bear in thy breeches,
The first of thy one and twenty*
What, do thy pockets gingle? Or shall we need to mingle
Our strength both of foot and horses!
These fellows look so eager, As if they would beleaguer
An Heir in the midst of his forces!
I hope they be no S^rieants! That hang upon thy margents.
This Rogue has the Ioule of a Iaylor*

P. IV. O Founder, no such matter, My Spurrier, and my Hatter, The young
Peny-boy answers in tune.
My Linen man, and my Tailor.
Thou should have been brought in too, Shoemaker,
If the time had been longer, and Thom Barber.
How do thou like my company, old Canter?
Do I not muster a brave troop? all Bill-men?
Present your Arms, before my Founder here,
This is my Founder, this same learned Canter!
He brought me the first news of my fathers death,
He takes the bills, and puts them up in his pockets. I thank him, and ever
since, I call him Founder*
Worship him, boys, I Will read only the sums.
And pass 'hem straight.

SHO. Now Ale.


REST. And strong Ale bless him.


P. IV. Gods so, some Ale, and Sugar for my Founder!
Good Bills, sufficient Bills, these Bills may pass.

P. CA. I do not like those paper-squibs, good Master.
They may undo your store, I mean, of Credit,
And fire your Arsenall, if case you do not
In time make good those outerworkes, your pockets,
And take a Garrison in of some two hundred,
To beat these Pyoners off, that carry a Mine
Would blow you up, at last. Secure your Casamates,
Here Master Picklocke, Sir, your man of Law,
And learned Att^rney, has sent you a Bag of munition.

P. IV. What is it?


P. CA. Three hundred pieces.


P. IV. I Will dispatch 'hem.


P. CA. Do, I would have your strengths lined, and perfumed
With Gold, as well as Amber.

P. IV. God a mercy,
Come, Ad soluendum, boys! there, there, and there, etc.
He pays all. I look on nothing but Totalis.

P. CA^ See!
The difference 'twixt the covetous, and the prodigal!
"The Covetous man never has money! and
"The Prodigal will have none shortly!

P. IV. Ha,
What says my Founder? I thank you, I thank you Sirs.

ALL. God bless your worship, and your worships Chanter.


P CA. I say it is nobly done, to cherish Shopkeepers,
And pay their Bills, without examining thus.

P. IV. Alas! they have had a pitiful hard time on it,
A long vacation, from their coozening.
Poor Rascals, I do do it out of charity.
I would advance their trade again, and have them
Haste to be rich, swear, and forswear wealthily,
What do you stay for, Sirrah?

SPV. To my box Sir,

P. IV. Your box, why, there is an angel, if my Spurs
He gives the Spurrier, to his box. Be not right Rippon.

SPV. Give me never a penny
If I strike not through your bounty with the Rowells.

P. IV. Do thou want any money Founder?


P. CA. Who, Sr. I,
Did I not tell you I was bred in the Mines,
Under Sir Beuis Bullion.

P. IV. That is true,
I quite forgot, you Myne-men want no money,
Your streets are pau'd with 't: there, the molten silver
Runns out like cream, on cakes of gold.

P. CA. And Rubies
Do grow like Strawberries.

P. IV. 'Twere brave being there!
Come Thom, we'll go to the Office now.

P. CA. What Office?


P. IV. News Office, the New Staple; thou shall go too,
It Is here in the house, on the same floor, Thom. says,
Come, Founder, let us trade in Ale, and nutmegges.

REG. Are those news registered,
That Emissary Buz sent in last night?
Of Spinola, and his Eggs?

CLE. Yes Sir, and filled.


REG. What are you now upon?


CLE. That our new Emissary
Westminster, gave us, of the Golden Heir.

REG. Dispatch, that is news indeed, and of importance.
What would you have good woman?

WOE. I would have Sir,
A groatsworth of any News, I care not what, A countrey-woman waits there.
To carry down this Saturday, to our Vicar.

REG. O! You are a Butterwoman, ask Nathaniel
The Clerk, there.

CLE. Sir, I tell her, she must stay
Till Emissary Exchange, or Paul's send in,
And then I Will fit her.

REG. Do good woman, have patience,

Now in the Bud, if you dispatch these Groats,
So soon: let them attend in name of policy.

what place is this?


CYM. This is the outer room, where my Clerks sit*
And keep their sides, the Register in the midst,
The Examiner, he sits private there, within,
And here I have my several Rowles, and Fyles
Of News by the Alphabet, and all put up
Under their heads.

P. IV. But those, too, subdivided?


CYM. Into Authentical, and Apocryphal.


FIT. Or News of doubtful credit, as Barbers news.


CYM. And Tailors News, Porters, and Watermens news,

FIT. Whereto, beside the Corant^, and Gazetti.


CYM. I have the News of the season.


FIT. As vacation news,
Terme-newes, and Christmas-newes.

CIM. And news of the faction.


FIT. As the Reformed news, Protestant news,

CYM. And Pontificiall news, o^ all which several,
The Day-bookes, Characters, Precedents are kept.
Together with the names of special friends --

FIT. And men of Correspondence in the Country --

CYM. Yes, of all ranks, and all Religions. --

FIT. Factors, and Agents --

CYM. Liegers, that lie out
Through all the Shires of the kingdom.

P. IV. This is fine!
And beats a brave relation! but what says
Mercurius Britannicus to this?

CYM O Sir, he gains by it half in half.


FIT. Nay more
I Will stan^ to it. For, where he was wont to get
In, hungry Captains* obscure Statesmen.

CYM. Fellows
To drink with him in a dark room in a Tavern,
And eat a Sawsage.

FIT. We have seen't,

CYM. As feign,
To keep so many politic pens
Going, to feed the press.

FIT. And dish ou^ news,
Were It true, or false.

CYM. Now all that charge is saved
The public Chronicler.

FIT. How, do you call him there?


CYM. And gentle Reader.


FIT. He that has the maidenhead
Of all the books.

CYM. Yes, dedicated to him,

FIT. Or rather prostituted.


P. IV. You are right, Sir.


CYM. No more shall be abused, nor country- Parsons
OF the Inquisition, nor busy Justices,
Trouble the peace, and both torment themselves,
And their poor ign'rant Neighbors with enquiries
After the many, and most innocent Monsters,
That never came in the Counties they were charged with.

P. IV. Why, me thinks Sir, if the honest common people
Will be abused, why should not they have their pleasure,
In the believing Lies, are made for them;
As you in the Office, making them your selves?

FIT. O Sir! it is the printing we oppose.


CYM. We not forbid that any News, be made,
But that 't be printed; for when News is printed,
It leaves Sir to be News. while it is but written --

FIT. Though it be never so false, it runs News still.


P. IV. See diverse men's opinions! unto some,
The very printing of them, makes them News;
That have not the heart to believe any thing,
But what they see in print.

FIT. I, that is an Error
Has abused many; but we shall reform it,
As many things beside (we have a hope)
Are crept among the popular abuses.

CYM. Nor shall the Stationer cheat upon the Time,
By buttering over again --

FIT. once, in Seven Years,
As the age doates --

CYM: And grows forgetful o'them,
^is antiquated Pamphlets, with new dates.
But all shall come from the Mint.

FIT. Fresh and new stamped,

CYM. With the Office-Seale, Staple Commodity.


FIT. And if a man will assure his News, he may:
Twopence a Sheet he shall be warranted,
And have a policy for it.

P. IV. Sir, I admire
The method of your place; all things within't
Are so digested, fitted, and composed,
As it shows Wit had married Order.

FIT. Sir.


CYM. The best we could to inuit the Times.


FIT. It has
Cost sweat, and freesing.

CYM. And some broken sleeps
Before it came to this.

P. IV. I easily think it.


FIT. But now it has the shape --

CYM. And is come forth.


P. IV. A most polite neat thing! with all the limbs,
As sense can taste!

CYM. It is Sir, though I say it,
As well-begotten a business, and as fairly
Helped to the World.

P. IV. You must be a Midwife Sir!
Or else the son of a Midwife! (pray you pardon me)
Have helped it forth so happily! what News have you?
News of this morning? I would feign hear some
Fresh, from the forge (as new as day, as they say.)

CYM. And such we have Sir.

Though he seem patched thus, and made up of pieces,

In this days Roll, already! I do muse
How you came by us Sir's!

CYM. One Master Pick-locke
A Lawyer, that has purchased here a place,
This morning, of an Emissary under me.

FIT. Emissarie Westminster.


CYM. Gave it into the Office,

FIT. For his Essay, his piece.


P. IV. My man of Law!
He Is my Attorney, and Sollicitour too!
A fine pragmaticke! what is his place worth?

CYM. A Nemo-scit, Sir.


FIT. It Is as News come, in,

CYM. And as they are issued. I have the just mcoytie
For my part: then the other mocytie

Whereof my Cozen Fitton here is for Court,
Ambler for Paul's, and Buz for the Exchange,
Picklocke, for Westminster, with the Examiner,
And Register, they have full parts: and then one part
Is vnder-parted to a couple of Clerks;
And there is the just division of the profits!

P. IV. Have you those Clarks Sir.


CYM. There is one Desk empty,
But it has many Suitors.

P. IV. Sir, may I
Present one more and carry it, if his parts
Or Gifts, (which you will, call'hem)

CYM. Be sufficient Sir.


P. IV. What are your present Clerks habilities?
How is he qualified?

CYM* A decayed Stationer
He was, but knows News well, can sort and rank 'hem.

FIT. And for a need can make 'hem.


CYM. True Paul's bred,
In The Churchyard.

P. IV. And this at the West-dore,
O'th other side, he is my Barber Thom,
A pretty Scholar, and a Master of Arts,
Was made, or went out Master of Arts in a throng,
At the University; as before, one Christmas,
He got into a Masque at Court, by his wit,
And the good means of his Cythern, holding up thus
For one of the Music, He Is a nimble Fellow!
And alike skilled in every liberal Science,
As having certain snaps of all, a neat,
Quick-vaine, in forging News too. I do love him,
And promised him a good turn, and I would do it.
What Is your price? the value?

CYM. Fifty pounds, Sr.


P. IV. Get in Thom, take possession, I install thee;
Here, tell your money; give thee joy, good Thom; He buys Thom a Clerks
place.

And let me hear from thee every minute of News,
While the New Staple stands, or the Office lasts,
Which I do wish, may never be less for thy sake.

CLA. The Emissaries, Sir, would speak with you,
And Master Fitton, they have brought in News,
Three Bale together.

CYM. Sr, you are welcome, here.


FIT. So is your creature.


CYM. Business calls us off, Sir, They take leave of Peny-boy, and Canter.
That may concern the Office.

P. IV. Keep me fair, Sir,
Still in your Staple, I am here your friend,
On the same flooer.

FIT. We shall be your servants.


P. IV. How do thou like it, Founder?


P. CA. All is well,
But that your man of law me thinks appears not
In his due time. O! Here comes Masters worship.

ACT. I. SCENE. VI.
PICKLOCK. PENI-BOY. IV. P. CANTER. HOw does the Heir, bright Master Peniboy?
Is he awake yet in his One and Twenty?
Why, this is better far, then to wear Cypress,
Dull smutting gloves, or melancholy blacks,
And have a pair of twelue-peny broad ribbands
Laid out like Labells.

P. IV. I should have made shift
To have laughed as heartily in my mourners hood,
As in this Suite, if it had pleased my father
To have been buried, with the Trumpeters:

PIC. The Heralds of Arms, you mean.


P. IV. I mean,
All noise, that is superfluous!

PIC. All that idle pomp,
And vanity of a Tombe-stone, your wise father
Did, by his will, prevent. Your worship had --

P. IV. A loving and obedient father of him,
I know it: a right, kinde-natur'd man,
To dye so opportunely.

PIC. And to settle
All things so well, compounded for your ward ship
The week before, and left your state entyre
Without any charge upon it.

P. IV. I must needs say,
I lost an Officer of him, a good Bayliffe,
And I shall want him; but all peace be with him,
I will not wish him alive, again; not I,
For all my Fortune; give your worship joy
O'your new place, your Emissary-ship,
In The News Office.

PIC. Know you, why I bought it Sr?


P. IV. Not I.


PIC. To work for you, and carry a mine
Against the Master of it, Master Cymball;
Who has a plot upon a Gentlewoman,
Was once designed for you, Sir.

P. IV. Me?


PIC. Your father,
Old Master Peni-boy, of happy memory,
And wisdom too, as any in the County,
Careful to find out a fit match for you,
In his own life time (but he was prevented)
Left it in writing in a Schedule here,
To be annexed to his Will; that you,
His only Son, upon his charge, and blessing,
Should take due notice of a Gentlewoman,
Soiourning with your uncle, Richer Peni-boy.

P. IV. A Cornish Gentlewoman, I do know her,
Mistress, Pecunia doe-all.

PIC. A great Lady,
Indeed she is, and not of mortal race,
Infanta of the Mines; her Graces Grandfather,
Was Duke, and Cousin to the King of Ophyr,
The Subterranean, let that pass. Her name is,
Or rather, her three names are (for such she is)
Aurelia Clara Pecunia, A great Princess,
Of mighty power, though she live in private
With a contracted family! Her Secretary --

P. CA. Who is her Gentleman-usher too.


PIC. One Broker,
And then two Gentlewomen; Mistress Statute,
And Mistress Band, with Wax the Chambermaide,
And Mother Mortgage, the old Nurse, two Grooms,
Pawn, and his fellow; you have not many to bribe, Sir.
The work is feizible, and th'approches easy,
By your own kindred. Now, Sir, Cymball thinks,
The Master here, and governor of the Staple,
By his fine arts, and pomp of his great place
To draw her! He concludes, she is a woman!
And that so soon as sh' hears of the New Office,
She Will come to visit it, as they all have longings
After new sights, and motions! But your bounty,
Person, and bravery must atchieue her.

P. CA. She is
The talk of the time* th'aduenture of the age!

PIC. You cannot put your self upon an action
Of more importance.

P. CA. All the world are suitors to her.


PIC. All sorts of men, and all professions!


P. CA. You shall have stall-fed Doctors, crammed Divines
Make love to her, and with those studied
And perfumed flatteries, as no rome can stink
More elegant, then where they are.

PIC. Well chanted
Old Canter thou singst true.

P. CA. And (by your leave)
Good Masters worship, some of your velvet coat
Make corpulent curt'^ies to her, till they crack for it.

PIC. There Is Doctor Almanac wooes her, one of the Ieerers,
A fine Physician.

P. CA. Your Sea-captaine, Shun field,
Gives out he will go upon the Cannon for her.

PIC. Though his loud mouthing get him little credit,

P. CA. Young Master Pyed mantle, the fine Herrald
Professes to deriuer her through all ages,
From all the Kings, and Queens, that ever were.

PIC. And Master Madrigall, the crowned Poet
Of these our times, does off^r at her praises
As fair as any, when it shall please Apollo,
That wit and rhyme may meet both in one subject.

P. CA. And you to bear her from all these, it will be --

PIC. A work of fame.


P. CA. Of honor.


PIC. Celebration.


P. CA. Worthy your name.


PIC. The Peni-boyes to live in it,

P. CA. It is an action you were built for, Sir,

PIC. And none but you can do it.


P. IV. I Will undertake it,

P. CA. And carry it.


P. IV. Fear me not, for since I came
Of mature age, I have had a certain itch
In my right eye, this corner, here, do you see?
To do some work, and worthy of a Chronicle.

The first Intermeane after the first Act.
MIRTH. How now Gossip! how does the Play please you?


CENSVRE. Very scuruily, me thinks, and sufficiently naught.


EXPECTATION. As a body would wish: here is nothing but a young Prodigal, come
of age, who makes much of the Barber, buys him a place in a new Office, in the
air, I know not where, and his man o'Law to follow him, with the Beggar to
boot, and they two help him to a wife.


MIRTH. I, she is a proper piece! that such creatures can broke for.


TATLE. I cannot abide that nasty fellow, the Beggar, if he had been a
Court-Begger in good clothes; a Beggar in velvet, as they say, I could have
endured him.


MIRTH. Or a begging scholar in black, or one of these beggarly Poets,
gossip, that would hang upon a young heir like a horseleech.


EXPEC. Or a threadbare Doctor of Physic, a poor Quackesaluer.


CENSVRE. Or a Sea-captaine, half steru'd.


MIRTH. I, these were tolerable Beggars, Beggars of fashion! you shall see some
such anon!


TATLE. I would feign see the Fool, gossip, the Fool is the finest man t'the
company, they say, and has all the wit: He is the very Justice of Peace of the
Play, and can cemmit whom he will, and what he will, error, absurdity, as
the toy takes him, and no man say, black is his eye, but laugh at him.


MIRTH. But they have no Fool in this Play, I am afraid, gossip.


TATLE. It Is a wise Play, then.


EXPECTATION. They are all fools, the rather, in that.


CENSVRE. Like enough.


TATLE. My husband, ( Timothy Tatle, God rest his poor soul) was wont to say,
there was no Play without a Fool, and a Devil in it; he was for the Devil
still God bless him. The Devil for his money, would he say, I would feign
see the Devil. And why would you so feign see the Devil? would I say. Because
he has horns, wife, and may be a cuckold, as well as a Devil, he would
answer: You are even such another, husband, quoth I. Was the Devil ever
married? where do you read, the Di^^ll was ever so honorable to commit
Matrimony; The Play will tell us, that, says he, we will go see it to morrow,
the Devil is an Ass. He is an errant learned man, that made it, and can
write, they say, and I am foully deceived, but he can read too.


MIRTH. I remember it gossip, I went with you, by the same token, Mrs. Trouble
Truth diswaded us, and told us, he was a profane Poet, and all his Plays had
Devils in them. That he kept schole vpo' the Stage, could conjure there, above
the Schole of Westminster, and Doctor Lamb too: not a Play he made, but had a
Devil in it. And that he would learn us all to make our husbands Cuckolds at
Plays: by another token, that a young married wife in the company, said, she
could find in her heart to steal thither, and see a little of the vanity
through her masque, and come practice at home.


TATLE. O, it was, Mistress --


MIRTH. Nay, Gossip, I name no body. It may be 'twas my self.


EXPECTATION. But was the Devil a proper man, Gossip?


MIRTH. As fine a gentleman* of his inches, as ever I saw trusted to the Stage*
or any where else: and loved the common wealth, as well as ere a Patriot of
'hem all: he would carry away the Vice on his back, quick to Hell, in every
Play where he came, and reform abuses.


EXPECTATION. There was the Devil of Edmonton, no such man, I warrant you.


CENSVRE. The Coniurer coosen'd him with a candles end, he was an Ass.


MIRTH. But there was one Smug, a Smith, would have made a horse laugh, and
broke his halter, as they say.


TATLE. O, but the poor man had got a shrewd mischance, one day.


EXPECTATION. How, Gossip?


TATLE. He had dressed a Rogue Jade in the morning, that had the Staggers, and had
got such a spice of 'hem himself, by noone, as they would not away all the
Play time, do what he could, for his heart.


MIRTH. 'Twas his part, Gossip, he was to be drunk, by his part.


TATLE. Say you so, I understood not so much.


EXPECTA. Would we had such an other part, and such a man in this play, I
fear 'twill be an excellent dull thing.


CENSVRE. Expect, intend it.


ACT. II. SCENE. I.
PENI-BOY. Sen. PECVNIA. MORTGAGE. STATVTE. BAND. BROKER. YOur Grace is sad me
thinks, and melancholy!
You do not look upon me with that face,
As you were wont, my Godnesse, bright Pecunia:
Although your Grace be fallen, of two in the hundred,
In vulgar estimation; yet am I,
You Graces servant still: and teach this body,
To bend, and these my aged knees to buckle,
In adoration, and just worship of you.
Indeed, I do confess, I have no shape
To make a minion of, but I Am your Martyr,
Your Graces Martyr. I can hear the Rogues,
As I do walk the streets, whisper, and point,
There goes old Peni-boy, the slave of money,
Rich Peni-boy, Lady Pecunia's drudge,
A sordid Rascal, one that never made
Good meal in his sleep, but sells the acates are sent him,
Fish, Foul, and venison, and preserues himself,
Like an old hoary Rat, with moldy pye-crust.
This I do hear, rejoicing, I can suffer
This, and much more, for your good Graces sake.

PEC. Why do you so my Guardian? I not bid you,
Cannot my Grace be gotten, and held too,
Without your selfe-tormentings, and your watches,
Your macerating of your body thus
With cares, and scantings of your diet, and rest?

P. SE. O, no, your services, my Princely Lady,
Cannot with too much zeal of rites be done,
They are so sacred.

PEC. But my Reputation.
May suffer, and the worship of my family,
When by ^o servile me^nes they both are sought.

P. SE. You are a noble, young, free, gracious Lady,
And would be every bodies, in your bounty,
But you must not be so. They are a few
That know your merit, Lady, and can valew't.
Your self scarce vnderstan^s your proper powers.
They are all-mighty, and that we your servants,
That have the honor here to stand so near you,
Know; and can use too. All this Nether-world
Is yours, you command it, and do sway it,
The honor of it, and the honesty,
The reputation, I, and the religion,
(I was about to say, and had not erred)
Is Queen Pecunia's. For that style is yours,
If mortals knew your Grace, or their own good.

MOR. Please your Grace to retire.


BAN. I fear your Grace
Has taken too much of the sharp air.

PEC. O no!
I could endure to take a great deal more
(And with my constitution, were it left)
Unto my choice, what think you of it, Statute?

STA. A little now and then does well, and keeps
Your Grace in your complexion.

BAN. And true temper.


MOR. But too much Madame* may increase cold rheumes,
Nou^ish catarrhes, green sicknesses, and agues,
And put you in consumption

P. SE. Best to take
Advice of your grave women, Noble Madame,
They know the state o'your body, and ha'studied
Your Graces health.

BAN. And honor. Here'll be visitants,
Or Suitors by and by; and it is not fit
They find you here.

STA. 'Twill make your Grace too cheap
To give them audience presently.

MOR. Leave your Secretary,
To answer them.

PEC. Wait you here. Broker.


BRO. I shall Madame.
And do your Graces trusts with diligence.

ACT. II. SCENE. II.
PYED-MANTLE. BROKER. PENI-BOY. SEN. WHat luck's this? I am come an inch too
late,
Do you hear Sir? Is your worship of the family
Unto the Lady Pecunia?

BRO. I serve her Grace, Sir,
Aurelia Clara Pecunia, the Infanta.

PIE. Has she all those Titles, and her Grace besides,
I must correct that ignorance and ouer-sight,
Before I do present. Sir, I have drawn
A Pedigree for her Grace, though yet a Nouice
In that so noble study.

BRO. A Herald at Arms?


PIE. No Sir, a Pursiuant, my name is Pyed-mantle.


BRO. Good Master Pyed-mantle.


PIE. I have deduced her. --

BRO. From all the Spanish Mines in the West-Indi'es,
I hope: for she comes that way by her mother,
But, by her Grandmother, she is Duchess of Mines.

PIE. From man's creation I have brought her.


BRO. No further?
Before Sr, long before, you have done nothing else,
Your Mines were before Adam, search your Office,
Roll five and twenty, you will find it so,
I see you are but a Nouice, Master Pyed-mantle.
If you had not told me so.

PIE. Sir, an apprentise
In armoiry. I have read the Elements,
And Accidence, and all the leading books,
And I have, now, upon me a great ambition,
How to be brought to her Grace, to kiss her hands.

BRO. Why, if you have acquaintance with Mistress Statute,
Or Mistress Band, my Ladies Gentlewomen,
They can induce you. One is a Judges Daughter,
But somewhat stately; the other Mistress Band,
Her father's but a Scriuener, but she can
Almost as much with my Lady, as the other,
Especially, if Rose Wax the Chambermaid
Be willing. Do you not know her, Sir, neither?

PIE. No in troth Sir.


BRO. She Is a good plyant wench,
And easy to be wrought, Sir, but the Nurse
Old mother Mortgage, if you have a Tenement,
Or such a morsel? though she have no teeth,
She loves a sweet meat, any thing that melts
In her warm gummes, she could command it for you
On such a trifle, a toy. Sir, you may see,
How for your love, and this so pure complexion,
(A perfect Sanguine) I have ventured thus,
The straining of a ward, opening a door
Into the secrets of our family:

PIE. I pray you let me know, Sir, unto whom
I am so much beholden; but your name.

BRO. My name is Broker, I am Secretary,
And Usher, to her Grace.

PIE. Good Master Broker!


BRO. Good Mr. Pyed-mantle.


PIE. Why? you could do me,
If you would, now, this favor of your self.

BRO. Truly, I think I could: but if I would,
I hardly should, without, or Mistress Band,
Or Mistress Statute, please to appear in it.
Or the good Nurse I told you of, Mistress Mortgage*
We know our places here, we mingle not
One in another sphere, but all move orderly,
In our own orbs; yet we are all Concentricks.

PIE. Well, Sir, I Will wait a better season.


BRO. Do,
And study the right means, get Mistress Band
Broker makes a mouth at him. He ieeres him again. Old Peny-boy leaps To urge
on your behalf, or little Wax.

PIE. I have a hope, Sir, that I may, by chance,
Light on her Grace, as she is taking the air:

BRO. That air of hope, has blasted many an ayrie
Of Castrills like your self: Good Master Pyed-mantle,

P. SE. Well said, Master Secretary, I stood behind
And h^ard thee all. I honor thy dispatches.
If they be rude, untrained it our method
And have not studied the rule, dismiss 'hem quickly,
Where Is Lickfinger my Cook? that unctuous rascal?
He Will never keep his hour, that vessel of kitchinstuffe!

ACT. II. SCENE. IIJ.
BROKER. PENY-BOY. SE. LICK-FINGER. Here he is come, Sir.


P. SE. Pox upon him kidney,
Always too late!

LIC. To wish 'hem you, I confess,
That ha'them already.

P. SE. What?


LIC. The pox!


P. SE. The piles,
The plague, and all diseases light on him,
Knows not to keep his word. I Would keep my word sure!
I hate that man that will not keep his word,
When did I break my word?

LIC. Or I, till now?
And it is but half an hour.

P. SE. Half a year:
To me that stands upon a minute of time.
I am a just man, I love still to be just.

LIC. Why? you think I can run like light-foot Ralph,
Or keep a wheele-barrow, with a sail in town here,
To whirle me to you: I have lost two stone
Of suet in the service posting hither,
You might have followed me like a watering pot,
And seen the knots I made along the street;
My face dropped like the skimmer in a fritter pan,
And my whole body, is yet (to say the truth)
A roasted pound of butter, with grated bread in 't! He sweepes his face.

P. SE. Believe you, he that list. You stayed of purpose,
To have my venison stink, and my foul mortified,
That you might have 'hem --

LIC. A shilling or two cheaper,
That Is your jealousy.

P. SE. Perhaps it is.
Will you go in, and view, and value all?
Yonder is venison sent me! foul! and fish!
In such abundance! I am sick to see it!
I wonder what they mean! I ha told 'hem of it!
To burden a weak stomach! and provoke
A dying appetite! thrust a sin upon me
I never was guilty of! nothing but gluttony!
Gross gluttony! that will undo this Land!

LIC. And bating two in the hundred.


P. SE. I, that same's
A crying sin, a fearful damned device,
Eats up the poor, deuoures 'hem --

LIC. Sir, take heed
What you give out.

P. SE. Against your grave great Solons?
Numae Pompilij, they that made that Law?
To take away the poore's inheritance?
It was their portion: I will stand to it.
And they have robbed 'hem of it, plainly robbed 'hem,
I still am a just man, I tell the truth.
When moneies went at Ten in the hundred, I,
And such as I, the servants of Pecunia,
Could spare the poor two out of ten, and did it,
How say you, Broker?

(LIC. Ask your Echo)

BRO. You did it.


P. S^. I am for Justice, when did I leave Justice?
We knew 'twas theirs, they'had right and Title to it.
Now --

LIC. You can spare 'hem nothing.


P. SE. Very little,

LIC. As good as nothing.


P. SE. They have bound our hands
With their wise solemn act, shortened our arms.

LIC. Beware those worshipful ears, Sir, be not shortened,
And you play Crop in the fleet, if you use this license.

P. SE. What license, Knave? Informer?


LIC. I am Lickfinger,
Your Cook.

P. SE. A saucy Jack you are, that is once;
What said I, Broker?

BRO. Nothing that I heard, Sir.


LIC. I know his gift, he can be deaf when he list.


P. SE. Have you provided me my bushel of eggs?
I did bespeake? I do not care how stale,
Or stinking that they be; let 'hem be rotten:
For ammunition here to pelt the boys,
That break my windows?

LIC. Yes Sir, I have spared 'hem
Out of the custard politic for you, the Majors.

P. SE. It Is well, go in, take hence all that excess,
Make what you can of it, your best: and when
I have friends, that I inuit at home, provide me
Such, such, and such a dish, as I bespeake;
One at a time, no superfluity.
Or if you have it not, return me money;
You know my ways.

LIC. They are a little crooked.


P. SE. How knave?


LIC. Because you do indent.


P. SE. It Is true, Sir,
I do indent you shall return me money.

LIC. Rather then meat, I know it: you are just still.


P. SE. I love it still. And therefore if you spend
The red-Deere pyes in your house, or sell 'hem forth, Sir,
Cast so, that I may have their coffins all,
Returned here, and pil'd up: I would be thought
To keep some kind of house.

LIC. By the mouldie signs?


P. SE. And then remember meat for my two dogs:
Fat flaps of mutton; kidneyes; rumps of veale;
Good plentious scraps; my maid shall eat the relics.

LIC. When you and your dogs have dined. A sweet reuersion.


P. SE. Who's here? my Courtier? and my little Doctor?
My Muster-Master? and what Plouer's that
They have brought to pull?

BRO. I know not, some green Plouer.
I Will find him out.

P. SE. Do, for I know the rest,
They are the Ieerers, mocking, flouting Iackes.

ACT. II. SCENE. IV.
FITTON. PENI-BOY. SE. ALMANACH. SHVNFIELD. MADRIGAL. LICK-FINGER. BROKER. HOw
now old Money-Bawd? we are come --


P. IV. To ieere me,
As you were wont, I know you.

ALM. No, to give thee
Some good security, and see Pecunia.

P. SE. What is it?


FIT. Our selves.


ALM. We Will be one bound for another.


FIT. This noble Doctor here.


ALM. This worthy Courtier.


FIT. This Man of war, he was our Muster-Master.


ALM. But a Sea-Captaine now, brave Captain Shun-field. He holds up his nose.


SHVN. You snuff the air now, as the scent displeased you?


FIT. Thou needst not fear him man, his credit is sound,

ALM. And seasoned too, since he took salt at Sea.


P. SE. I do not love pickl^d security,
Would I had one good Fresh-man in for all;
For truth is, you three stink.

SHV. You are a Rogue,

P. SE. I think I am, but I will lend no money
On that security, Captain.

ALM. Here Is a Gentleman,
A Fresh-man in the world, one Master Madrigall.

FIT. Of an untainted credit; what say you to him?


SHV. He Is gone me thinks, where is he? Madrigall? Madrigall steps aside with
Broker.


P. SE. H' has an odd singing name, is he an Heir?


FIT. An Heir to a fair fortune,

ALM. And full hopes:
A dainty Scholar, and a pretty Poet!

P. SE. You Have said enough. I have no money, Gentlemen,
An^ he go to it in ryme once, not a penny

SHV. Why, he is of years, though he have little beard. He snuffes again.


P. SE. His beard has time to grow. I have no money:
Let him still dable in Poetry. No Pecunia
Is to be seen.

ALM. Come, thou love to be costiue
Still in thy curt'sie; but I have a pill,
A golden pill to purge away this melancholy.

SHV. It Is nothing but his keeping of the house here,
With his two drowsy dogs.

FIT. A drench of sack
At a good tavern, and a fine fresh pullet,
Would cure him.

LIC. Nothing but a young Hair in white-broth,
I know his diet better then the Doctor.

SHV. What Lick-finger? mine old host of Ram-Alley?
You have some mer^at here.

ALM. Some dosser of Fish
Or Foul to fetch of.

FIT. An odd bargain of Venison,
To drive.

P. SE. Will you go in, knave?


LIC. I must needs,
You see who drives me, gentlemen.

ALM. Not the devil.


FIT, He may be in time, he is his Agent, now.


P. SE. You are all cogging Iacks, a Couy of wits,
The Ieerers, that still call together at meals:
Or rather an Airy, for you are birds of prey:
Peny-boy thrusts him in. And fly at all, nothing's too big or high for you.
And are so truly feared, but not beloved
One of another: as no one dares break
Company from the rest, lest they should fall,
Upon him absent.

ALM. O! the only Oracle
That ever peept, or spoke out of a dublet.

SHV. How the rogue stinks, worse then a Fishmonger sleeves!


FIT. Or Curriers hands!


SHV. And such a perboil'd visage!


FIT. His face looks like a Diers apron, just!


ALM. A sodden head, and his whole brain a possit curd!


P. SE. I, now you ieere, ieere on; I have no money.


ALM. I wonder what religion he is of!


FIT. No certain species sure, A kind of mule!
That Is half an Ethnicke, half a Christian!

P. Se. I have no money, gentlemen.


SHV. This stock.
He has no sense of any virtue, honor,
Gentry or merit.

P. Se. You say very right,
My meritorious Captain, (as I take it!)
Merit will keep no house, nor pay no house rent.
Will Mistress Merit go to market, think you?
Set on the pot, or feed the family?
Will Gentry clear with the Butcher? or the Baker?
Fetch in a Phessant, or a brace of Partridges,
From good-wife Poulter, for my Ladies supper.

FIT. See! this pure rogue!


P. Se. This rogue has money though,
My worshipful brave Courtier has no money.
No, nor my valiant Captain.

SHV. Hang you rascal.


P. Se. Nor you, my learned Doctor. I loved you
Whil you did hold your practice, and kill tripe wives.
And kept you to your vrinall; but since your thombes
Have greased the Ephemerides, casting figures,
And turning over for your Candle-rents,
And your twelve houses in the Zodiac:
With your Almutens, Alma cantaras,
Troth you shall cant alone for Peny-boy.

SHV. I told you what we should find him, a mere Bawd.


FIT. A rogue, a cheater.


P. Se. What you please, gentlemen,
I am of that humble nature and condition,
Never to mind your worships, or take notice
Of what you throw away, thus. I keep house here
Like a lame Cobbler, never out of doors,
With my two dogs, my friends; and (as you say)
Drive a quick pretty trade, still. I get money:
And as for Titles, be they Rogue, or Rascal,
Or what your worships fancy, let 'hem pass
As transitory things; they are mine to day,
And yours to morrow.

ALM. Hang thee dog.


SHV. Thou curre.


P. Se. You see how I do blush, and am ashamed
Of these large attributes? yet you have no money.

ALM. Well wolf, Hyaena, you old pockie rascal,
You will have the Hernia fall down again
Into your Scrotum, and I shall be sent for.
I will remember then, that; and your Fistula
In ano, I cured you of.

P. Se. Thank your dog-leech craft.
They were 'holesome piles, before you meddl'd with 'hem.

ALM. What an ungrateful wretch is this?


SHV. He minds
A courtesy no more, then London Bridge,
What Arch was mended last.

FIT. He never thinks.
More then a logge, of any grace at Court,
A man may do him: or that such a Lord
Reached him his hand.

P. Se. O yes! if grace would strike
The brewers Tally, or my good Lords hand,
Would quit the scores. But Sir, they will not do it,
Here Is a piece, my good Lord piece, does all.
Goes to the Butehers* fetches in a muton, He shows a piece.
Then to the Bakers, brings in bread, makes fires,
Gets wine, and does more real Courtesies,
Then all my Lords, I know: My sweet Lord piece!
You are my Lord, the rest are cogging Iacks,
Under the Rose.

SHV. Rogue, I could beat you now,

P. Se. True Captain, if you durst beat any other.
I should believe you, but indeed you are hungry;
You are not angry Captain, if I know you
Aright; good Captain. No, Pecunia,
Is to be seen, though Mistress Band would speak,
Or little Blushet- Wax, be never so easy,
I Will stop mine ears with her, against the Sirens,
Court, and Philosophy. God be wi^ you, Gentlemen,
Provide you better names. Pecunia is for you.

FIT. What a damned Harpy it is? where is Madrigall?
Is he sneek'd hence.

SHV. Here he comes with Broker, Madrigall returns.
Pecunia's Secretary.

ALM. He may do some good
With him perhaps. Where have you been Madrigall?

MAD. Above with my Ladies women, reading verses.


FIT. That was a favor. Good morrow, Master Secretary.


SHV. Good morrow, Master Usher.


ALM. Sir, by both
Your worshipful Titles, and your name Mas Broker.
Good morrow.

MAD. I did ask him if he were
Amphibion Broker.

SHV. Why?


ALM. A creature of two natures,
Because he has two Offices.

BRO. You may ieere,
You have the wits, young Gentlemen. But your hope
Of Helicon, will never carry it, here,
With our fat family; we have the dullest,
Most unboar'd Ears for verse amongst our females.
I grieved you read so long, Sir, old Nurse Mortgage,
She snoar'd in the Chair, and Statute (if you marked her)
Fell fast a sleep, and Mistress Band, she nodded,
But not with any consent to what you read.
They must have somewhat else to chinke, then rymes.
If you could make an Epitaph on your Land,
(Imagine it on departure) such a Poem
Would wake 'hem* and bring Wax to her true temper.

MAD. I faith Sir, and I will try.


BRO. It Is but earth,
Fit to make brickes and tyles of.

SHV. Pocks upon it
It Is but for pots, or pipkins at the best.
If it would keep us in good tobacco pipes,

BRO. 'Twere worth keeping.


FIT. Or in porc lane dishes
There were some hope.

ALM. But this is a hungry soil,
And must be helped.

FIT. Who would hold any Land
To have the trouble to marle it.

SHV. Not a gentleman.


BRO. Let clownes and hyndes affect it, that love ploughes,
And carts, and harrowes, and are busy still,
In vexing the dull element.

ALM. Our sweet Songster
Shall rarifie't into air.

FIT. And you Mas. Broker
Shall have a feeling.

BRO. So it supple, Sir,
The nerves.

MAD. O! it shall be palpable,
Make thee run through a hoope, or a thombe-ring,
The nose of a tobacco pipe, and draw
Thy ductile bones out, like a knitting needle,
To serve my subtle turns.

BRO. I shall obey, Sir,
And run a thread, like an houre-glasse.

P. S^. Where is Broker?
Are not these flies gone yet? pray' quit my house,
I Will smoke you out else.

FIT. O! the Prodigal!
Will you be at so much charge with us, and loss?

MAD. I have heard you have offered Sir, to lock up smoke,
And cauke your windores, spar up all your doors,
Thinking to keep it a close prisoner wi'you,
And wept, when it went out, Sir, at your chimney.

FIT. And yet his eyes were dryer then a pummise.


SHV. A wretched rascal, that will bind about
The nose of his bellows, lest the wind get out
When he is abroad.

ALM. Sweepes down no cobwebs here,
But sells 'hem for cut-fingers. And the spiders,
As creatures reared of dust, and cost him nothing,
To fat old Ladies monkeyes.

FIT. He has offer^d
To gather up spilt water, and preserve
Each hair falls from him to stop balls with all.

SHV. A slave, and an Idolater to Pecunia!


P. SE. You all have happy memories, Gentlemen,
In rocking my poor cradle. I remember too,
When you had lands, and credit, worship, friends,
I, and could give security: now, you have none,
Or will have none right shortly. This can time,
And the vicissitude of things. I have
All these. and money too, and do possess 'hem,
And am right heartily glad of all our memories,
And both the changes.

FIT. Let us leave the viper.


P. SE. He Is glad he is rid of his torture, and so soon.
Broker, come hither, up, and tell your Lady,
She must be ready presently, and Statute,
Band, Mortgage, Wax. My prodigal young kinsman
Will straight be here to see her; 'top of our house,
The flourishing, and flanting Peny-boy.
We were but three of us in all the world,
My brother Francis, whom they called Franck Peny-boy,
Father to this: he is dead. This Peny-boy,
Is now the heir! I, Richer Peny-boy,
Not Richard, but old Harry Peny-boy,
And (to make rhyme) close, wary Peny-boy
I shall have all at last, my hopes do tell me.
Go, see all ready; and where my dogs have falted,
Remove it with a broom, and sweeten all
With a slice of juniper, not too much, but sparing,
We may be faulty our selves else, and turn prodigal,
In entertaining of the Prodigal.
Here he is! and with him -- what! a Clapper Dudgeon!
That Is a good sign; to have the beggar follow him,
So near at his first entry into fortune.

And the brave Lady, here, the daughter of Ophir,

P. SE. Sweet Nephew, if she were
The daughter of the Sun, she is at your service,
And so am I, and the whole family,
Worshipful Nephew.

P. IV. Sai'st thou so, dear Uncle?
Welcome my friends then: Here is, Domine Picklocke:
My man of Law, sollicits all my causes.
Follows my business, makes, and compounds my quarrels,
Between my tenants and me, sowes all my strifes,
And reapes them too, troubles the country for me,
And vexes any neighbor, that I please.

P. SE. But with commission?


P. IV. Under my hand and seal.


P. Se. A worshipful place!


PIC. I thank his worship for it.


P. SE. But what is this old Gentleman?


P. CA. A Rogue,
A very Canter, I Sir, one that maunds
Upon the Pad, we should be brothers though:
For you are near as wretched as my self,
You dare not use your money, and I have none.

P. SE. Not use my money, cogging Jack, who uses it
At better rates? lets it for more in the hundred,
Then I do, Sirrah?

P. IV. Be not angry uncle.


P. SE. What? to disgrace me, with my Queen? as if
I did not know her value.

P. CA. Sir, I meant
You durst not to enjoy it.

P. SE. Hold your peace,
Young Peny-boy is angyry. You are a Jack.

P. SE. Uncle, he shall be a John,
And, you go to that, as good a man as you are.
An' I can make him so, a better man,
Perhaps I will too. Come, let us go.

P. SE. Nay, kinsman,
My worshipful kinsman; and the top of our house;
Do not your penitent uncle that affront,
For a rash word, to leave his joyful threshold,
Before you see the Lady that you long for.
The Venus of the time, and state, Pecunia!
I do perceive, your bounty loves the man,
(...) concealed virtue, that he hides
Under th^se ^ags.

P. CA. I owe my happiness to him,
^qord^ waiting on his worship, since I brought him
(...), welcome to all young heirs.

P. IV. Thou did indeed, for which I thank thee yet,
Your (...) Princess, Uncle, is long a coming.

P. CA. She is not rigged, Sir, setting forth some Lady,
^ill cost as much as furnishing a Fleet,

She kisseth him.

(...) in the prow.

P. IV. Is this Pecunia?


P. S^. Vouchsafe my toward kinsman, gracious Madame,
The savor of your hand.

PEC. Nay, of my lips, Sir,
To him.

P. IV. She kisses like a mortal creature,
Almighty Mad^^e, I have longed to see you.

PEC. And I have my desire, Sir, to behold
That youth, and shape, which in my dreams and wakes*
I have so often contemplated, and felt
Warm in my v^ynes, and native as my blood.
When I was told of your arrival here,
I felt my heart beat, as it would leap out,
In speech; and all my face it was a flame,
But how it came to pass I do not know.

P. I^. O! beauty loves to be more proud then nature,
That made you blush. I cannot satisfy
My curious eyes, by which alone I Am happy,
In my beholding you.

P. CA. They pass the complement
Prettily well.

PIC. I, he does kiss her, I like him.


P. IV. My passion was clear contrary, and doubtful, He kisseth her.
I shook for fear, and yet I danced for joy,
I had such motions as the Sunne-beames make
Against a wall, or playing on a water,
Or trembling vapor of a boiling pot --

P. SE. That Is not so good, it should ha'bin a Crucible,
With molten metal, she had understood it.

P. IV. I cannot talk, but I can love you, Madame.
Are these your Gentlewomen? I love them too.
And which is mistress Statute? Mistress Band*
They all kiss close, the last stuck to my lips.

B^O. It was my Ladies Chambermaid, soft- Wax.


P. IV. Soft lips she has, I am sure on it. Mother Mortgage,
IN low a kiss* till she be younger, Statute, He doubles the complement to
them all.

Sweet Mistress Band, and honey, little Wax,
We must be better acquainted.

STA. We are but servants, Sir.


BAND. But whom her Grace is so content to grace,
We shall observe.

WAX. Aand with all fit respect.


MOR. In our poor places.


WAX. Being her Graces shadows.


P. IV. A fine well-spoken family. What Is thy name?


BRO. Broker.


P. IV. Me thinks my uncle should not need thee,
Who is a crafty Knave, enough, believe it.
Art thou her Graces Steward?

BRO. No, her Usher, Sir.


P. IV. What, of the Hall? thou have a sweeping face,
Thy beard is like a broom.

BRO. No barren chin, Sir,
I am no Eunuch, though a Gentleman-usher.

P. IV. Thou shall go with us. Uncle, I must have
My Princess forth to day.

P. SE. Whither you please, Sir,
You shall command her.

PEC. I will do all grace
To my new servant.

P. SE. Thanks unto your bounty;
He is my Nephew, and my Chief, the Point,
Old Peny-boy thanks her, but makes his condition.
Tip, Top, and Tuft of all our family!
But, Sir, conditioned always, you return
Statute, and Band home, with my sweet, soft Wax,
And my good Nurse, here, Mortgage.

P. IV. O! what else?


P. SE. By Broker.


P. IV. Do not fear.


P. SE. She shall go wi' you,
Whither you please, Sir, any where.

P. CA. I see
A Money-Bawd, is lightly a Flesh-Bawd, too.

PIC. Are you aduis^d? Now of my faith, this Canter
Would make a good grave Burgess in some Barn.

P. IV. Come, thou shall go with us, uncle.


P. CA. By no means, Sir.


P. IV. We'll have both Sack, and Fiddlers.


P. SE. I Will not draw
That charge upon your worship.

P. CA. He speaks modestly,
And like an Uncle,

P. SE. But Mas Broker, here,
He shall attend you, Nephew; her Graces Usher,
And what you fancy to bestow on him,
Be not too lavish, use a temperate bounty,
I Will take it to my self.

P. IV. I will be princely,
While I possess my Princess, my Pecunia.

P. SE. Where is it you eat?


P. IV. Hard by, at Picklocks lodging.
Old Lickfinger's the Cook, here in Ram-Alley.

P. SE. He has good cheer; perhaps I Will come and see you.


P. CAN. O, fie! an Alley, and a Cooks-shop, gross,
The Canter takes him aside, and persuades him, 'T will savor, Sir, most
rankly of 'hem both.
Let your meat rather follow you, to a tavern.

PIC. A tauern's as unfit too, for a Princess.


P. CA. No, I have known a Princess, and a great one,
Come forth of a tavern.

PIC. Not go in, Sir, though.


P. CA. She must go in, if she came forth: the blessed
Pokahontas (as the Historian calls her
And great Kings daughters of Virginia)
Has bin in womb of a tavern; and besides,
Your nasty Uncle will spoil all your mirth,
And be as noisome.

PIC. That Is true.


P. CA. No 'faith,
Dine in Apollo with Pecunia,
At brave Duke Wadloos, have your friends about you,
And make a day on it.

P. IV. Content 'ifaith:
Our meat shall be brought thither. Simon the King,
Will bid us welcome.

PIC. Patron, I have a suite.


P. IV. What Is that?


PIC. That you will carry the Infanta,
To see the Staple', her Grace will be a grace,
To all the members of it.

P. IV. I will do it:
And have her Arms set up there, with her Titles,
Aurelia Clara Pecunia, the Infanta.
And in Apollo. Come (sweet Princess) go.

P. SE. Broker, be careful of your charge.


BRO. I warrant you.


The second Intermeane after the second Act.
CENSVRE. Why, this is duller and duller! intolerable! scuruy! neither Devil
nor Fool in this Play! pray God, some on us be not a witch, Gossip, to
forespeake the matter thus.


MIRTH. I fear we are all such, and we were old enough: But we are not all old
enough to make one witch. How like you the Vice in the Play.


EXPECTATION. Which is he?


MIR. Three or four: old Covetousness, the sordid Peny-boy, the Money-bawd,
who is a flesh-bawd too, they say.


TATLE. But here is never a Fiend to carry him away. Besides, he has never a
wooden dagger! I Would not give a rush for a Vice, that has not a wooden dagger to
snap at every body he meets.


MIRTH. That was the old way, Gossip, when Iniquity came in like Hokos Pokos,
in a Iuglers ierkin, with false skirts* like the Knave of Clubs! but now they
are attired like men and women of the time, the Vices, male and female!
Prodigality like a young heir, and his Mistress Money (whose favors he
scatters like counters) prank't up like a prime Lady, the Infanta of the Mines.


CEN. I, therein they abuse an honorable Princess, it is thought.


MIRTH. By whom is it so thought? or where lies the abuse?


CEN. Plain in the stiling her Infanta, and giving her three names.


MIRTH. Take heed, it lie not in the vice of your interpretation: what have
Aurelia, Clara, Pecunia to do with any person? do they any more, but express
the property of Money, which is the daughter of earth, and drawn out of the
Mines? Is there nothing to be called Infanta, but what is subject to exception?
Why not the Infanta of the Beggars? or Infanta of the Gypsies? as well as King
of Beggars, and King of Gypsies?


CEN. Well, and there were no wiser then I, I would sow him in a sack, and send
him by sea to his Princess.


MIRT. Faith, and he heard you Censure, he would go near to stick the Asses
ears to your high dressing, and perhaps to all ours for harkening to you.


TATLE. By'r Lady but he should not to mine, I would harken, and harken, and
censure, if I saw cause, for the other Princess sake Pokahontas, surnamed the
blessed, whom he has abused indeed (and I do censure him, and will censure
him) to say she came forth of a Tavern, was said like a paltry Poet.


MIRTH. That Is but one Gossips opinion, and my Gossip Tatle's too! but what
says Expectation, here, she sits sullen and silent.


EXP. Troth I expect their Office, their great Office! the Staple, what it will
be! they have talked on it, but we see it not open yet; would Butter would come
in, and spread it-selfe a little to us.


MIRTH. Or the butter-box, Buz, the Emissary.


TATLE. When it is churn'd, and dish't, we shall hear of it.


EXP. If it be fresh and sweet butter; but say it be sower and wheyish.


MIR. Then it is worth nothing, mere pot- butter, fit to be spent in
suppositories, or greasing coach-wheeles, stale stinking butter, and such I
fear it is, by the being barrell'd up so long.


EXPECTATION. Or rank Irish butter.


CEN. Have patience Gossips, say that contrary to our expectations it prove
right, seasonable, salt butter.


MIR. Or to the time of year, in Lent, delicate Almond butter! I have a sweet
tooth yet, and I will hope the best; and sit down as quiet, and calm as
butter; look as smooth, and soft as butter; be merry, and melt like butter;
laugh and be fat like butter: so butter answer my expectation, and be not mad
butter; If it be: It shall both July and December see. I say no more, But --
Dixi.


TO THE READERS.
IN this following Act, the Office is opened, and shown to the Prodigal, and
his Princess Pecunia, wherein the allegory, and purpose of the Author has
hitherto been wholly mistaken, and so sinister an interpretation been made,
as if the souls of most of the Spectators had lived in the eyes and ears of
these ridiculous Gossips that tattle between the Acts. But he prays you thus
to mend it. To consider the News here vented, to be none of his News, or any
reasonable man's; but News made like the times News, (a weekly cheat to draw
money) and could not be fitter reprehended, then in raising this ridiculous
Office of the Staple, wherein the age may see her own folly, or hunger and
thirst after published pamphlets of News, set out every Saturday, but made all
at home, and no syllable of truth in them: then which there cannot be a greater
disease in nature, or a fouler scorn put upon the times. And so apprehending
it, you shall do the Author, and your own judgment a courtesy, and perceive
the trick of alluring money to the Office, and there cooz'ning the people. If
you have the truth, rest quiet, and consider that

Ficta, voluptatis causa, sint proxima veris. ACT. III. SCENE. I.
FITTON. CYMBAL, to them PICKLOCKE. REGISTER. CLERK. THO: BARBER. YOu hunt
upon a wrong scent still, and think
The air of things will carry 'hem, but it must
Be reason and proportion, not fine sounds,
My cousin Cymball, must get you this Lady.
You have entertained a petty-fogger here,
Picklocke, with trust of an Emissartes place,
And he is, all, for the young Prodigal,
You see he has left us.

CYM. Come, you do not know him,
That speak thus of him. He will have a trick,
To open us a gap* by a trap-doore,
When they least dream on it. Here he comes. What news?

PICK. Where is my brother Buz? my brother Ambler:
The Register, Examiner, and the Clerks?
Appear, and let us muster all in pomp,
For here will be the rich Infanta, presently,
To make her visit. Peny-boy the heir,
My Patron, has got leave for her to play
With all her train, of the old churl, her Guardian.
Now is your time to make all court unto her;
That she may first but know, then love the place,
And show it by her frequent visits here:
And afterward, get her to soiourne with you.
She will be weary of the Prodigal, quickly.

CYM. Excellent news!


FIT. And counsel of an Oracle!


CYM. How say you cousin Fitton?


FIT. brother Picklock,
I shall adore thee, for this parcel of tidings,
It will cry up the credit of our Office,
Eternally, and make our Staple immortal!

PICK. Look your addresses, then, be fair and fit,
And entertain her, and her creatures, too,
With all the migniar dise, and quaint Caresses,
You can put on 'hem.

FIT. Thou seem, by thy language,
No less a Courtier, then a man of Law.
I must embrace thee.

PIC. Tut, I am Vertumnus,
On every change, or chance, upon occasion,
A true Chamaelion, I can color for it.
I move upon my axell, like a turne-pike.
Fit my face to the parties, and become
Straight, one of them.

CYM. Sirs, up, into your Desks,
And spread the rolls upon the Table, so.
Is the Examiner set?

REG. Yes, Sir.


CYM. Ambler, and Buz,
Are both abroad, now.

PIC. We Will sustain their parts.
No matter, let them ply the affairs without,
Fitton puts on the office cloak, and Cymbal the gown. Let us alone within, I
like that well.
On with the cloak, and you with the Staple gown,
And keep your state, stoop only to the Infanta;
We'll have a flight at Mortgage, Statute, Band,
And hard, but we'll bring Wax unto the retriue:
Each know his several province, and discharge it.

FIT. Fitton is brought abent. I do admire this nimble ingine, Picklock.


CYM. Cuz,
What did I say?

FIT. You have rectified my error!

CVSTOMERS. BY your leave, Gentlemen, what news? good, good still?
In Your new Office? Princess, here is the Staple!
This is the Governor, kiss him, noble Princess,
For my sake. Thom, how is it honest Thom?
How does thy place, and thou? my Creature, Princess?
He tells Pecunia of Thom.
This is my Creature, give him your hand to kiss,
He was my Barber, now he writes Clericus!
I bought this place for him, and gave it him.

P. CA. He should have spoke of that, Sir, and not you:
Two do not do one Office well.

P. IV. It Is true,
But I am loath to lose my courtesies.

P. CA. So are all they, that do them, to vain ends,
And yet you do lose, when you pay you selves.

P. IV. No more of your sentences, Canter, they are stale,
We come for news, remember where you are.
I pray thee let my Princess hear some news,
Good Master Cymbal.

CYM. What news would she hear?
Or of what kind, Sir?

P. IV. Any, any kind.
So it be news, the newest that thou have,
Some news of State, for a Princess.

CYM. Read from Rome, there.


THO. They write, the King of Spain is chosen Pope.


P. IV. How? News from Rome.


THO. And Emperor too, the thirtieth of February.


P. IV. Is the Emperor dead?


CYM. No, but he has resigned, News of the Emperor, and Tilly.

And trailes a pike now, under Tilly.

FIT. For penance.


P. IV. These will beget strange turns in Christendom!


THO. And Spinola is made General of the Jesuits. News of Spinola. The fifth
Monarchy, uniting the Ecclesiasticke and Secular power. A plot of the house of
Austria. More of Spinola.


P. IV. Stranger!


FIT, Sir, all are alike true, and certain.


CYM. All the pretense to the fifth Monarchy,
Was held but vain, until the ecclesiastique,
And secular powers, were united, thus,
Both in one person.

FIT. 'T has bin long the aim
Of the house of Austria.

CYM. See but Maximilian,
His letters to the Baron of Bouttersheim,
Or Scheiter-huyssen.

FIT. No, of Liechtenstein,
Lord Paul, I think.

P. IV. I have heard of some such thing.
Don Spinola made General of the Jesuits!
A Priest!

CYM. O, no, he is dispensed with all,
And the whole society, who do now appear
The only Enginers of Christendom.

P. IV. They have bin thought so long, and rightly too.


FIT. Witness the Engine, that they have presented him,
To wind himself with, up, into the Moon:
And thence make all his discoueries!

CYM. Read on.


THO. And Vittellesco, he that was last General,
Being now turned Cook to the society,
Has dressed his excellence, such a dish of eggs --

P. IV. What potch'd?


THO. No, powdered. His Eggs.


CYM. All the yolke is wild fire,
As he shall need beleaguer no more towns,
But throw his Egg in.

FIT. It shall clear consume,
Palace, and place; demolish and bear down,
All strengths before it!

CYM. Never be extinguished!
Till all become one ruin!

F^. And from Florence,

THO. They write was found in Galileos study,
A burning Glass (which they have sent him too) Galilaeo's study.

To fire any Fleet that is out at Sea --

CYM. By Mooneshine, is it not so?


THO. Yes, Sir, in the water.


P. IV. His strengths will be irresistable, if this hold! The burning glass,
by Moonshine.

Ha'you no News against him, on the contrary?

CLA. (...) Ecle.
Yes, Sit, they write here, one Cornelius-(...),
Has made the Hollanders an invisible Ecle,
To swim the haven at Dunk^^ke, and sink all
The shipping there.

P. IV. Why ha^not you this, Thom?


(...). Because he keeps the Pontificiall side.


P. IV. Peny-boy will have him change sides*
How, change sides, Thom. 'Twas never in my thought
To put thee up against our selves. Come down,
Quickly.

CYM. Why, Sir?


P. IV. I venter'd not my money
Upon those terms: If he may change; why so.
I Will ha him keep his own side, sure.

FIT, Why, let him,
It Is but writing so much over again.

P. IV. For that I Will bear the charge: There Is two Pieces,

FIT. Come, do not stick with the gentleman.


CYM. I Will take none Sir*
And yet he shall ha'the place.

P. IV. They shall be (...),
though he pay for it.
Up, Thom: and the Office shall take 'hem. Keep your side, Thom.
Know your own side, do not forsake your side, Thom.

CYM. Read.


THO. They write here one Cornelius-(...),
Has made the Hollanders an invisible Ecle,
To swim the Haven at Dunkirke, and sink all
The shipping there.

P. IV. But how is it done?


CYM. I Will show you Sir
It is an A^toma, runs under water,
With a s^^g nose, and has a nimble tail
Made like an anger, with which tail she wrigles
Betwixt the coasts of a Ship, and sinkes it straight.

P. IV. Whence ha'you this news.


FIT. From a right hand I assure you,
The Ecle-boats here, that lie before Queen-Hyth,
Came out of Holland.

P. IV. A most brave device,
To murder their flat bottomes.

FIT. I do grant you*
Spinola's new project: an army in cork-shooes.
But what if Spinola have a new Project:
To bring an army over in corke-shooes,
And land them, here, at Harwich? all his horse
Are shod with cork, and fourscore pieces of ordinance,
Mounted upon cork-carriages, with bladders,
In stead of wheels to run the passage over
At a springtide.

P. IV. Is It true?


FIT. As true as the rest*

P. IV. He Will never leave his engines: I would hear now
Some curious news.

CYM. As what?


P. IV. Magic, or (...)
Or flying in the air, I care not what.

CLA. They write from Libtzig (reverence to your (...))
The Art of drawing farts out of dead bodies,
Extraction of farts
Is by the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross,
Produced unto perfection, in so sweet
And rich a tincture --

FIT. As there is no Princess,
But may perfume her chamber with the extraction.

P. IV. There Is for you, Princess.


P. CA. What, a fart for her?


P. IV. I mean the spirit.


P. CA. Beware how she r^sents it.


P. IV. The perpetual Motion.
And what have thou, Thom?


THO. The perpetual Motion*
Is here found out by an Alewife in Saint Katherines,
At the sign of the dancing Bears*

P. IV. What, from her tap?
I Will go see that, or else I Will send old Canter.
He can make that discovery.

P. CA. Yes, in Ale.


P. IV. Let me have all this News, made up, and sealed*

REG. The people press upon us, please you, Sir, The Register offers him a
room.
Withdraw with your fair Princess. There Is a room
Within, Sir, to retire too.

P. IV. No, good Register,
We'll stand it out here, and observe your Office; The Office called the house
of fame.

What News it issues.

REG. It Is the house of fame, Sir,
Where both the curious, and the negligent;
The scrupulous, and careless; wild, and stayed;
The idle, and laborious; all do meet,
To taste the Cornu copiae of her rumors,
Which she, the mother of sport* pleases to scatter
Among the vulgar: Baits, Sir, for the people!
And they will bite like fishes.

P. IV. Let Us see it.


DOP. Ha'you in your profane Shop, any News
Of The Saints at Amsterdam?

REG. Yes, how much would you? 1. Cust. Ash baptist.


DOP. Six penny worth.


REG. Lay your money down, read, Thomas.


THO. The Saints do write, they expect a Prophet, shortly,
The Prophet Baal, to be sent over to them, Prophet Baal expected in Helland.

To calculate a time, and half a time,
And the whole time, according to Naometry.

P. IV. What Is that?


THO. The measuring of the Temple: a Cabal
Found out but lately, and set out by Archie,
Or some such head, of whose long coat they have heard,
And being black, desire it.

DOP. Peace be with them! Archie mourned then.


REG* So there had need, for they are still by the ears
One with another.

DOP. It is their zeal.


REG. Most likely.


DOP. Have you no other of that species?


REG. Yes,
But dearer, it will cost you a shilling.

DOP. Verily,
There is a nine-pence, I will shed no more.

REG. Not, to the good of the Saints?


DOP. I am not sure,
That, man is good.

REG. Read, from Constantinople,
Nine penny'orth.

THO. They give out here, The great Turk turned Christian*
the grand Signior
Is certainly turned Christian, and to clear
The controuersie'twixt the Pope and him,
Which is the Antichrist; he means to visit
The Church at Amsterdam, this very Summer,
And quit all marks of the beast.

DOP. Now joyful tidings.
Who brought in this? Which Emissary?

REG. Buz.
Your countryman.

DOP. Now, blessed be the man,
And his whole Family, with the Nation.

REG. Yes, for Amboyna, and the Justice there!
This is a Doper, a she Anabaptist!
Seal and deliver her her news, dispatch.

C. 2. Ha'you any news from the Indies? any mirac^
2. Cust.
Done in Iapan, by the Jesuits? or in China?

CLA. A Coloney ^e Cooks sent over to con^ert the Canniballs.
No, but we hear of a Colony of cooks
To be set a shore of the coast of America,
For the conversion of the Caniballs,
And making them good, eating Christians.
Here comes the Colonel that undertakes it.

C. 2. 3. Cust. By Colonel Lickfinger.
Who? captain Lickfinger?


LIC. News, news my boys!
I am to furnish a great feast to day,
And I would have what news the Office affords.

CLA. We were venting some of you, of your new project,

REG. Before 'twas paid for, you were somewhat too hasty.


P. IV. What Lickfinger! will thou convert the Caniballs,
With spit and pan Divinity?

LIC. Sir, for that
I will not urge, but for the fire and zeal
To the true cause; thus I have undertaken:
With two Lay-brethren, to my self, no more,
One of the broach, the other of the boyler,
In one six months, and by plain cookery,
No magic to it, but old Iap^ets physic,
The father of the Europaean Arts,
To make such sauces for the Savages,
And cooks their meats, with those enticing steemes,
As it would make our Caniball-Christians,
Forbear the mutual eating one another,
Which they do do, more cunningly, then the wild
Anthropophagi; that snatch only strangers,
Like my old Patrons dogs, there.

P. IV. O, my Uncles!
Is dinner ready, Lickfinger?

LIC. When you please, Sir.
I was bespeaking but a parcel of news,
To strew out the long meal withal, but't seems
You are furnished here already.

P. IV. O, not half!


LIC. What Court-newes is there? any Proclamations,
Or Edicts to come forth.

THO. Yes, there is one.
That the Kings Barber has got, for aid of our trade:
Whereof there is a manifest decay.
T^ let long hair run to seed* to sow bald pates.
A Precept for the wearing of long hair,
To run to seed, to sow bald pates withal,
And the preserving fruitful heads, and chins,
To help a mystery, almost antiquated.
Such as are bald and barren beyond hope,
Are to be separated, and set by
For Vshers, to old Countesses.

LIC. And Coachmen.
To mount their boxes, reverently, and drive,
Like Lapwings, with a shell vpo' their heads.
Through the streets. Ha'you no News o the St^ge?
They Will ask me about new Plays, at dinner time.
And I should be as dumb as a fish.

THO. O! yes.
There is a Legacy left to the Kings Players, Spalato's Legacy to the Players.

Both for their various shifting of their Scene,
And dext'rous change o'their persons to all shapes,
And all disguises: by the right reverend
Archbishop of Spalato.

LIC. He is dead,
That played him!

THO. Then, h'has lost his share of the Legacy.


LIC. What news of Gundomar?


THO. A second Fistula,
Or an excoriation (at the least)
For putting the poor English-play, was writ of him, Gundomar's use of the
game at Chesse, or Play so called.

To such a sordid use, as (is said) he did,
Of cleansing his posterior's.

LIC. Justice! Justice!


THO. Since when, he lives condemned to his share, at Bruxels.
And there sits filing certain politic hinges,
To hang the States on, h'has heau'd off the hooks.

LIC. What must you have for these?


P. IV. Thou shall pay nothing,
But reckon 'hem in in the bill. There Is twenty pieces,
Her Grace bestows upon the Office, Thom, He gives 20. pieces, to the Office.
Doubles it.
Write thou that down for News.

REG. We may well do it,
We have not many such.

P. IV. There Is twenty more,
If you say so; my Prin^cesse is a Princess!
And put that too, under the Office Seal.

CYM. If it will please your Grace to soiourne here, Cymbal takes Pecunia
aside, courts and wooes her, to the Office.
And take my roof for covert, you shall know
The rites belonging to your blood, and birth,
Which few can apprehend: these sordid servants,
Which rather are your keepers, then attendants,
Should not come near your presence. I would have
You waited on by Ladies, and your train
Borne up by persons of quality, and honor,
Your meat should be served in with curious dances,
And set upon the board, with virgin hands,
Tuned to their voices; not a dish removed,
But to the Music, nor a drop of wine,
Mixed, with his water, without Harmony,

PEC. You are a Courtier, Sir, or somewhat more;
That have this tempting language!

CYM. I Am your servant,
Exellent Princess, and would ha'you appear
That, which you are. Come forth State, and wonder,
Of these our times, dazzle the vulgar eyes.
And strike the people blind with admiration.

P. CAN. Why, that is the end of wealth! thrust riches outward,
And remain beggars within: contemplate nothing
But the vile sordid things of time, place, money,
And let the noble, and the precious go,
Virtue and honesty; hang 'hem; poor thin membranes
Of honor; who respects them? O, the Fates!
How has all just, true reputation fallen,
Fitton has been courting the waiting-women, this while, and is ieered by
them. Since money, this base money 'gan to have any!

BAN. Pity, the Gentleman is not immortal.


WAX. As he gives out, the place is, by description.


FIT. A very Paradise, if you saw all, Lady.


WAX. I am the Chambermaid, Sir, you mistake,
My Lady may see all.

FIT. Sweet Mistress Statute, gentle Mistress Band,
And Mother Mortgage, do but get her Grace
To soiourne here. --

PIC. I thank you gentle Wax,

MOR. If it were a Chattell, I would try my credit.


PIC. So it is, for term of life, we count it so.


STA. She means, Inheritance to him, and his heirs*
Or that he could assure a State, of years:
I Will be his Statute-Staple, Statute-Merchant,
Or what he please.

PIC. He can expect no more.


BAN. His cousin Alderman Security,
That he did talk of so, even now --

STA. Who, is
The very broch of the bench, gem of the City.

BAN. He and his Deputy, but assure his life
For one seven years.

STA. And see what we'll do for him,
Upon his scarlet motion.

BAN. And old Chain,
That draws the city-eares.

WAX. When he says nothing,
But twirles it thus.

STA. A moving Oratory!


BAN. Dumb Rethoricke, and silent eloquence!
As the fine Poet says!

FIT. Come, they all scorn us,
Do you not see it? the family of scorn!

BRO. Do not believe him! gentle Master Picklocke,
They understood you not: the Gentlewomen,
They thought you would ha'my Lady soiourne, with you,
And you desire but now and then, a visit?

PIC. Yes, if she pleased, Sir, it would much advance
Unto the Office, her continual residence!
(I speak but as a member)

BRO. It Is enough.
I apprehend you. And it shall go hard,
But I Will so work, as some body shall work her!

PIC. 'pray you change with our Master, but a word about it.


P. IV. Well, Lickfinger, see that our meat be ready,
Thou have News enough.

LIC. Something of Bethlem Gabor,
And then I Am gone.

THO. We hear he has devised
Bethlem Gabors Drum.
A Drum, to fill all Christendom with the sound:
But that he cannot draw his forces near it,
To march yet, for the violence of the noise.
And therefore he is feign by a design,
To carry 'hem in the air, and at some distance,
Till he be married, then they shall appear.

LIC. Or never; well, God b'wi'you (stay, who is here?)
A little of the Duke of Bauier, and then --

CLA. H^has taken a gray habit, The Duke of Bauier.
and is turned
The Churches Millar, grinds the catholic grist
With every wind: and Tilly takes the toll.

CVS. 4. Ha'you any news of the Pageants to send down?
Into the several Counties. 4. Cust. The Pageants.
All the country
Expected from the city most brave speeches*
Now, at the Coronation.

LIC. It expected
More then it understood: for, they stand mute,
Poor innocent dumb things; they are but wood.
As is the bench and blocks, they were wrought on, yet
If May Day come, and the Sun shine, perhaps,
They Will sing like Memnons Statue, and be vocal.

CVS. 5. Ha'you any Forest-newes?


THO. None very wild, Sir,
Some tame there is, out of the Forest of fools, 5. Cust. The new Park in the
Forest of Fools.

A new Park is a making there, to sever
Cuckolds of Antler, from the Rascals. Such,
Whose wives are dead, and have since cast their heads,
Shall remain Cuckolds-pollard.

LIC. I Will ha'that news.


CVS. 1. And I.


2. And I.


3. And I.


4. And I.


5. And I.


CYM. Sir, I desire to be excused; and, Madame: Peny-boy would inuit the
Master of the Office

I cannot leave my Office, the first day.
My Cousin Fitton here, shall wait upon you.
And Emissary Picklocke.

P. IV. And Thom: Clericus?


CYM. I cannot spare him yet, but he shall follow you,
When they have ordered the Rolls. Shut up the Office,
When you ha'done, till two a clock.

ACT. III. SCENE. III.
SHVNFIELD. ALMANAC. MADRIGAL. CLERKS. BY your leave, Clerks,
Where shall we dine to day? do you know? the Ieerers.

ALM. Where Is my fellow Fitton?


THO. New gone forth.


SHV. Cannot your Office tell us, what brave fellows
Do eat together to day, in town, and where?

THO. Yes, there is a Gentleman, the brave heir, young Peny-boy,
Dines in Apollo.

MAD. Come, let us thither then,
I have supt in Apollo!

ALM. With the Muses?


MAD. No,
But with two Gentlewomen, called, the Graces*

ALM. They' were ever three in Poetry.


MAD. This was truth, Sir.


THO. Sir, Master Fitton's there too!


SHV. All the better!


ALM. We may have a ieere, perhaps.


SHV. Yes, you will drink, Doctor.
(If there be any good meat) as much good wine now,
As would lay up a Dutch Ambassador.

THO. If he dine there, he is sure to have good meat,
For, Lickfinger prouides the dinner.

ALM. Who?
The glory of the Kitchen? that holds Cookery,
A trade from Adam? quotes his broths* and sallads?
And swears he is not dead yet, but translated
In some immortal crust, the past of Almonds?

MAD. The same. He holds no man can be a Poet,
That is not a good Cook, to know the palats,
And several tastes of the time. He draws all Arts
Out of the Kitchen, but the Art of Poetry,
which he concludes the same with Cookery.

SHV. Tut, he maintains more heresies then that.
He Will draw the Magisterium from a minc'd-pye,
And prefer Iellies, to your Iulips, Doctor*

ALM. I was at an Olla Podrida of his making,
Was a brave piece of cookery! at a funeral!
But opening the pot-lid, he made us laugh,
who'had wept all day! and sent us such a tickling
Into our nostrills, as the funeral feast
Had bin a wedding-dinner.

SHV. Gi'him allowance,
And that but moderate, he will make a Siren
Sing in the Kettle, send in an Arion,
In a brave broth, and of a watery green,
Just the Sea-colour, mounted on the back
Of a grown Cunger, but, in such a posture,
As all the world would take him for a Dolphin.

MAD. He Is a rare fellow, without question! but
He holds some Paradoxes.

ALM. I, and Pseudodoxes.
Mary, for most, he is Orthodox in the Kitchen.

MAD. And knows the Clergies taste!


ALM. I, and the Layties!


SHV. You think not o'your time, we'll come too late,
If we go not presently.

MAD. Away then.


SHV. Sirs,
You must get of this news, to store your Office,
Who dines and sups in the town? where, and with whom?
'Twill be beneficial: when you are stored;
And as we like our fare, we shall reward you.

CLA. A hungry trade,'twill be.


THO. Much like D. Humphries,
But, now and then, as th'holesome proverb says,
'Twill obsonare samem ambulando.

CLA. Shut up the Office: gentle brother Thomas.


THO. Brother, Nathaniel, I ha'the wine for you.
I hope to see us, one day, Emissaries.

CLA. Why not? S'lid, I despair not to be Master!


ACT. III. SCENE. IV.
PENI-BOY. SE. BROKER. CYMBAL. HOw now? I think I was borne under Hercules
star!
Nothing but trouble and tumult to oppress me? He is started with Broker's
coming back.
Why come you back? where is your charge?

BRO. I ha'brought
A Gentleman to speak with you?

P. SE. To speak with me?
You know it is death for me to speak with any man.
What is he? set me a chair.

BRO. He Is the Master
Of the great Office.

P. SE. What?


BRO. The Staple of News,
A mighty thing, they talk Six thousand a year.

P. SE. Well bring your six in. Where have you left Pecunia?


BRO. Sir, in Apollo, they are scarce set.


P. SE. Bring six.


BRO. Here is the Gentleman.


P. SE. He must pardon me,
I cannot rise, a diseased man.

CYM. By no means, Sir,
Respect your health, and ease.

P. SE. It is no pride in me!
But pain, pain; what is your errand, Sir, to me? He sends Broker back.
Broker, return to your charge, be Argus-eyed,
Awake, to the affair you have in hand,
Serve in Apollo, but take heed of Bacchus.
Go on, Sir.

CYM. I am come to speak with you.


P. SE. It Is pain for me to speak, a very death,
But I will hear you!

CYM. Sir, you have a Lady,
That soiournes with you.

P. SE. Ha? He pretends infirmity. I am somewhat short
In my sense too --

CYM. Pecunia.


P. SE. OF that side,
Very imperfect, on --

CYM. Whom I would draw
Oftener to a poor Office, I am Master of --

P. SE. My hearing is very dead, you must speak quicker.


CYM. Or, if it please you, Sir, to let her soiourne
In part with me; I have a moiety
We will divide, half of the profits.

P. SE. Ha?
I hear you better now, how come they in?
Is it a certain business, or a casual?
For I am loath to seek out doubtful courses,
Run any hazardous paths, I love straight ways,
A just, and upright man! now all trade totters.
The trade of money, is fallen, two in the hundred.
That was a certain trade, while the age was thrifty,
And men good husbands, looked unto their stocks,
Had their minds bounded; now the public Riot
Prostitutes all, scatters away in coaches,
In foot-mens coats, and waiting women's gowns,
They must have velvet hanches (with a pox)
Now taken up, and yet not pay the use;
He talks vehemently and aloud. Bate of the use? I am mad with this times
manners.

CYM. You said even now, it was death for you to speak.


P. SE. I, but an anger, a just anger, (as this is)
Puts life in man. Who can endure to see
The fury of men's gullets, and their groines?
Is moved more and more. What fires, what cooks, what kitchins might be spared?
What Stews, Ponds, Parks, Coupes, Garners, Magazines?
What veluets, tissues, scarfes, embroyderies?
And laces they might lack? They covet things --
Superfluous still; when it were much more honor
They could want necessary! What need has Nature
Of silver dishes? or gold chamber-pots?
Of perfumed napkins? or a numerous family,
To see her eat? Poor, and wise she, requires
Meat only; Hunger is not ambitious:
Say, that you were the Emperor of pleasures,
The great Dictator of fashions, for all Europe,
And had the pomp of all the Courts, and Kingdoms,
Laid forth unto the show? to make your self
Gazed, and admired at? You must go to bed,
And take your natural rest: then, all this vanishes.
Your bravery was but showen; 'twas not possessed:
While it did boast it self, it was then perishing.

CYM. This man has healthful lungs.


P. SE. All that excess
Appeared as little yours, as the Spectators.
It scarce fills up the expectation
Of a few hours, that entertaines men's lives.

CYM. He has the monopoly of sole-speaking.
He is angry. Why, good Sir? you talk all.

P. SE. Why should I not?
Is it not under mine own roof? my feeling?

CYM. But I came hete to talk with you.


P. S. Why, an'I will not
Talk with you, Sir? you are answered, who sent for you?

CYM. Bids him get out of his house.
No body sent for me --

P. SE. But you came, why then
Go, as you came, here is no man holds you, There,
There lies your way, you see the door.

CYM. This's strange!


P. Se. It Is my ciuility, when I do not relish
The party, or his business. Pray you be gone, Sir.
I Will have no venture in your Ship, the Office
Your Bark of Six, if'twere sixteen, good, Sir,

CYM. You are a rogue.


P. SE. I think I am Sir, truly.


CYM. Cymbal railes at him. He ieeres him.
A Rascal, and a money-bawd.


P. SE. My surnames:

CYM. A wretched Rascal!


P. S. You will ouerflow --
And spill all.

CYM. Caterpiller, moath,
Horse-leach, and dung-worme --

P. SE. Still you lose your labor.
I am a broken vessel, all runs out:
A shrunk old Dryfat. Fare you well, good Six.

The third Intermeane after the third Act.
CENSVRE. A notable tough Rascal! this old Peny-boy! right City-bred!


MIRTH. In Siluer-streete, the Region of money, a good seat for a Usurer.


TATLE. He has rich ingredients in him, I warrant you, if they were extracted,
a true receipt to make an Alderman, an' he were well wrought upon, according to
Art.


EXP. I would feign see an Alderman in chimia! that is a treatise of
Aldermanity truly written.


CEN. To show how much it differs from Vrbanity.


MIRTH. I, or humanity. Either would appear in this Peny-boy, an' he were
rightly distilled. But how like you the news? you are gone from that.


CEN. O, they are monstrous! scuruy! and stale! and too exotic! ill cooked!
and ill dish'd!


EXP. They were as good, yet, as butter could make them!


TAT. In a word, they were beastly buttered! he shall never come of my bread
more, nor my in mouth, if I can help it. I have had better news from the
bake-house, by ten thousand parts, in a morning: or the conduicts in
Westminster! all the news of Tutle-street, and both the Alm'ries! the two
Sanctuaries* long, and round Wool-staple! with Kings-street, and Chanon-row to
boot!


MIRTH. I, my Gossip Tatle knew what fine slips grew in Gardiners-lane; who
kissed the Butchers wife with the Cowes-breath; what matches were made in the
bowling-Alley, and what bettes won and lost; how much grieft went to the Mill
and what besides: who coniur'd in Tutle-fields, and how many? when they never
came there. And which Boy rode upon Doctor Lamb, in the likeness of a roaring
Lion, that run away with him in his teeth, and has not devoured him yet.


TAT. Why, I had it from my maid Ioane Hearsay: and she had it from a limb
of the school, she says, a little limb of nine year old; who told her, the
Master left out his coniuring book one day, and he found it, and so the Fable
came about. But whether it were true, or no, we Gossips are bound to believe
it, an't be once out, and a foot: how should we entertain the time else, or
find our selves in fashionable discourse, for all companies, if we do not
credit all, and make more of it, in the reporting?


CEN. For my part, I believe it: and there were no wiser then I, I would have
never a cunning Schoolmasters in England. I mean a Cunning-Man, a
Schoolmasters; that is a Coniurour, or a Poet, or that had any acquaintance
with a Poet. They make all their scholars Play-boyes! Is It not a fine sight,
to see all our children made Enterluders? Do we pay our money for this? we
send them to learn their Grammar, and their Terence, and they learn their
play-books? well, they talk, we shall have no more Parliaments (God bless us)
but an'wee have, I hope, Zeale-of-the-land Buzy, and my Gossip, Rabby
Trouble-truth will start up, and see we shall have painful good Ministers to
keep School, and Catechize our youth, and not teach 'hem to speak Plays,
and Act Fables of false news, in this manner, to the super-uexation of Town
and Country, with a wanion.


ACT. IIII. SCENE. I.
PENY-BOY. IV. FITTON. SHVNFIELD. ALMANAC. MADRIGAL. CANTER. PICKLOCKE. COme,
Gentlemen, let us breath from healths a while.
This Lickfinger has made us a good dinner,
For our Pecunia: what shal's do with our selves,
While the women water? and the Fiddlers eat?

FIT. Let Us ieere a little.


P. IV. Ieere? what is that?


SHV. Expect, Sr.


ALM. We first begin with our selves, and then at you,

SHV. A game we use.


MAD. We ieere all kind of persons
We meet withal, of any rank or quality,
And if we cannot ieere them, we ieere our selves.

P. CA. A pretty sweet society! and a grateful!


PIC. 'Pray let us see some.


SHV. Have at you, then Lawyer.
They say, there was one of your coat in Bet'lem, lately,

ALM. I wonder all his Clients were not there.


MAD. They were the madder sort.


PIC. Except, Sir, one
Like you, and he made verses.

FIT. Madrigall,
A ieere.

MAD. I know.


SHV. But what did you do, Lawyer?
When you made love to Mistress Band, at dinner.

MAD. Why? of an Advocate, he grew the Clyent.


P. IV. Well played, my Poet.


MAD. And showed the Law of nature
Was there above the Common Law.

SHV. Quit, quit,

P. IV. Call you this ieering? I can play at this,
It Is like a Ball at Tennis.

FIT. Very like,
But we were not well in.

ALM. It Is indeed, Sir.
When we do speak at volley, all the ill
We can one of another.

SHV. As this morning,
(I would you had heard us) of the Rogue your Uncle.

ALM That Mony-bawd.


MAD. We called him a Coat-card
Of The last order.

P. IV. What Is that? a Knave?


MAD. Some readings have it so, my manuscript
Does speak it, ^arlet.

P. CA. And your self a Fool
Of The first rank, and one shall have the leading
Of The right hand file, under this brave Commander.

P. IV. What say thou, Canter?


P. CA. Sir, I say this is
A very wholesome exercise, and comely.
Like Lepers, showing one another their scabs.
Or flies feeding on ulcers.

P. IV. What News Gentlemen?
Have you any news for after dinner? me thinks
We should not spend our time unprofitably.

P. CA. They never lie, Sir, between meals, against supper
You may have a Bale or two brought in.

FIT. This Canter,
Is an old envious Knave!

ALM. A very Rascal!


FIT. I have marked him all this meal, he has done nothing
But mock, with scuruy faces, all we said.

ALM. A supercilious Rogue! he looks as if
He were the Patrico --

MAD. Or Archpriest of Canters,

SHV. He Is some primate metropolitan Rascal,
Our shot-clog makes so much of him.

ALM The Law,
And he does govern him

P. IV. What say you, Gentlemen?


FIT. We say, we wonder not, your man of Law,
Should be so gracious wi'you; but how it comes,
This Rogue, this Canter!

P. IV. O, good words.


FIT. A fellow
That speaks no language --

ALM. But what gingling Gypsies,
And Pedlers trade in --

FIT. And no honest Christian
Can understand --

P. CA. Why? by that argument,
You all are Canters, you, and you, and you, He speaks to all the Ieerers.

All the whole world are Canters, I will prove it
In your professions.

P. IV. I would feign hear this,
But stay, my Princess comes, provide the while,
I Will call for it anon. How fares your Grace?

ACT. IIII. SCENE. II.
LICKFINGER. PECVNIA. STATVTE-BAND. WAX. to them. I hope the fare was good.


PEC. Yes, Lickfinger,
Lickfinger is challenged by Madrigal of an argument.
And we shall thank you for it and reward you.

MAD. Nay, I Will not lose my argument, Lickfinger;
Before these Gentlemen, I affirm,
The perfect, and true strain of poetry,
Is rather to be given the quick Celler,
Then the fat Kitchen.

LIC. Heretic, I see
Thou art for the vain Oracle of the Botle.
The hogshead, Trismegistus, is thy Pegasus.
Thence flows thy Muses spring, from that hard hoof:
Seduced Poet, I do say to thee,
A Boyler, Range, and Dresser were the Fountains,
Of all the knowledge in the universe.
And they 'are the Kitchins, where the Master-Cooke --
(Thou do not know the man, nor can thou know him,
Till thou have served some years in that deep school,
That Is both the Nurse and Mother of the Arts,
And hear'st him read, interpret, and demonstrate!)
A Master-Cooke! Why, he is the man of men,
For a Professor! he designs, he draws,
He paints, he carues, he builds, he fortifies,
Makes Citadels of curious foul and fish,
Some he dri-dishes, some motes round with broths.
Mounts marrowbones, cuts fifty angled custards,
Reares bulwark pies, and for his outerworkes
He raises Ramparts of immortal crust;
And teaches all the Tacticks, at one dinner:
What Ranks, what Files, to put his dishes in;
The whole Art Military. Then he knows,
The influence of the Stars upon his meats,
And all their seasons, tempers, qualities,
And so to fit his relishes, and sauces,
He has Nature in a pot, above all the Chemists,
Or airy brethren of the Rosie-crosse.
He is an Architect, an Inginer,
A Soldier, a Physician, a Philosopher,
A general Mathematician.

MAD. It is granted.


LIC. And that you may not doubt him, for a Poet --

ALM. This fury shows, if there were nothing else!
And it is divine! I shall for ever hereafter,
Admire the wisdom of a Cook!

BAN. And we, Sir!


P. IV. O, how my Princess draws me, with her looks, Peny-boy is courting
his Princess all the while.
And hales me in, as eddies draw in boats,
Or strong Charybdis ships, that sail too near
The shelues of Love! The tides of your two eyes!
Wind of your breath, are such as suck in all,
That do approach you!

PEC. Who has changed my servant?


P. IV. Your self, who drink my blood up with your beams;
As does the Sun, the Sea! Pecunia shines
More in the world then he: and makes it Spring
Where ever she favors! 'please her but to show
Her melting wrests, or bare her yuorie hands,
She catches still! her smiles they are Love's fetters!
Her breasts his apples! her teats Stawberries!
Where Cupid (were he present now) would cry
Fare well my mothers milk, here is sweeter Nectar!
Help me to praise Pecunia, Gentlemen:
She Is your Princess, lend your wits,

FIT. A Lady,
The Graces taught to move!

ALM. The Flowers did nurse! They all begin the ^ncomium of Pecunia.


FIT. Whose lips are the instructions of all Lovers!


ALM. Her eyes their lights, and riualls to the Stars!


FIT. A voice, as if that Harmony still spoke!


ALM. And polished skin, whiter then Venus foot!


FIT. Young Hebes neck, or Iunoe's arms!


ALM. A hair,
Large as the Mornings, and her breath as sweet,
As meddowes after rain, and but new mowne!

FIT. Laeda might yield unto her, for a face!


ALM. Hermione for breasts!


FIT. Flora, for cheeks!


ALM. And Helen for a mouth!


P. IV. Kiss, kiss 'hem, Princess. She kisseth them.

FIT. The pearl does strive in whiteness, with her neck,

ALM. But loses by it: here the Snow thawes Snow;
One frost resolves another!

FIT. O, she has
A front too slippery to be looked upon!

ALM. And glances that beguile the seers eyes!


P. IV. Kiss, kiss again, what says my man of war? Again.

SHV. I say, she is more, then Fame can promise of her.
A Theme, that is overcome with her own matter!
Praise is struck blind, and deaf, and dumb with her!
She does astonish Commendation!

P. IV. Well pumpt in faith old Sailor: kiss him too:
Though he be a slugge. What says my Poet-sucker! She kisseth Captain
Shunfield.
He Is chewing his Muses cudde, I do see by him.

MAD. I have almost done, I want but e'ne to finish.


FIT. That Is the 'ill luck of all his works still.


P. IV. What?


FIT. To begin many works, but finish none;

P. IV. How does he do his Mistress work?


FIT. Imperfect.


ALM. I cannot think he finisheth that.


P. IV. Let Us hear*

MAD. It is a Madrigall, I affect that kind
Of Poem, much.

P. IV. And thence you have the name.


FIT. It is his Rose. He can make nothing else

MAD. I made it to the tune the Fiddlers played,
That we all liked so well.

P. IV. Good, read it, read it.


MAD. The Sun is father of all mettalls, you know,
Silver, and gold.

P. IV. I, leave your Prologues, say!


SONG.
MADRIGAL. As bright as is the Sun her Sire,
Or Earth her mother, in her best atyre,
Or Mint, the Midwife, with her sire,
Comes forth her Grace!
The splendor of the wealthiest Mines!
The stamp, and strength of all imperial lines,
Both majesty and beauty shines,
In her sweet face!
Look how a Torch, of Taper light,
Or of that Torches flame, a Beacon bright;

P. IV. That Mint the Midwife does well.


FIT. That Is fairly said of Money.


P. IV. Good!


MAD. Now there, I want a line to finish, Sir.


P. IV. Or of that Beacons fire, Moone-light:

MAD. So takes she place!


FIT. It Is good.
And then I 'haue a Saraband --
She makes good cheer, she keeps full boards,
She holds a Fair of Knights, and Lords,
A Market of all Offices,
And Shops of honor, more or less.
According to Pecunia's Grace,
The Bride has beauty, blood, and place,
The Bridegroom virtue, valor, wit,
And wisdom, as he stands for it.

PIC. Call in the Fiddlers. Nicke, the boy shall sing it,
He urges her to kiss them all.
Sweet Princess, kiss him, kiss 'hem all, dear Madame,
And at the close, vouchsafe to call them Cousins.

PEC. Sweet Cousin Madrigall, and Cousin Fitton,
My Cousin Shunfield, and my learned Cousin.

P. CA. Al-manach, though they call him Almanac.


P. IV. Why, here is the Prodigal prostitutes his Mistress!


P^IV. And Picklocke, he must be a kinsman too.
My man of Law will teach us all to win,
And keep our own. Old Founder.

P. CA. Nothing, I Sir?
I am a wretch, a beggar. She the fortunate.
Can want no kindred, we, the poor know none.

FIT. Nor none shall know, by my consent.


ALM. Nor mine,

P. IV. Sing, boy, stand here.


P. CA. Look, look, The boy sings the song. how all their eyes
Dance i'their heads (observe) scattered with lust!
At sight of their brave Idol! how they are tickled,
With a light air! the bawdy Saraband!
They are a kind of dancing engines all!
And set, by nature, thus, to run alone
To every sound! All things within, withou them,
Move, but their brain, and that stands still! mere monsters
Here, in a chamber, of most subtle feet!
And make their legs in tune, passing the streets!
These are the gallant spirits of the age!
The miracles of the time! that can cry up
And down men's wits! and set what rate on things
Their half-brain'd fancies please! Now pox vpon'hem.
See how solicitously he learnes the Iigge,
As if it were a mystery of his faith!

SHV. A dainty ditty!


FIT. O, he is a dainty Poet!
When he sets to it!

P. IV. And a dainty Scholar! They are all struck with admiration.

ALM. No, no great scholar, he writes like a Gentleman.


SHV. Pox of your Scholar.


P. CA. Pox o'your distinction!
As if a Scholar were no Gentleman.
With these, to write like a Gentleman, will in time
Become, all one, as to write like an Ass,
These Gentlemen? these Rascals! I am sick
Of indignation at 'hem.

P. IV. How do you liked, Sir?


FIT. It Is excellent!


ALM. 'Twas excellently sung!


FIT. A dainty Air!


P. IV. What says my Lickfinger?


LIC. I am telling Mistress Band, and Mistress Statute,
What a brave Gentleman you are, and Wax, here!
How much 'twere better, that my Ladies Grace,
Would here take up Sir, and keep house with you.

P. IV. What say they?


STA. We could consent, Sr, willingly.


BAND. I, if we knew her Grace had the least liking.


WAX. We must obey her Graces will, and pleasure.


P. IV. I thank you, Gentlewomen, ply 'hem, Lickfinger.
Give mother Mortgage, there --

LIC. Her doze of Sack.
I have it for her, and her distance of Hum.

PEC. Indeed therein, I must confess, dear Cousin, The Gallants are all
about Pecunia.
I am a most unfortunate Princess.

ALM. And
You still will be so, when your Grace may help it.

MAD. Who'ld lie in a room, with a close-stoole, and garlic?
And kennell with his dogs? that had a Prince
Like this young Peny-boy, to soiourne with?

SHV. He Will let you have your liberty --

ALM. Go forth,
Whither you please, and to what company --

MAD. Scatter your self amongst us --

P. IV. Hope of Pernassus!
Thy Iuy shall not wither, nor thy Bays,
Thou shall be had into her Graces Cellar,
And there know Sack, and Claret, all December,
Thy vein is rich, and we must cherish it.
Poets and Bees swarm now adays, but yet
There are not those good Tauernes, for the one sort,
As there are Flowrie fields to feed the other.
Though Bees be pleased with dew, ask little Wax
That brings the honey to her Ladies hiue:
The Poet must have wine. And he shall have it.

ACT. IIII. SCENE. IIJ.
PENI-BOY. SE. PENY-BOY. IV. LICKFINGER. etc. BRoker? what Broker?


P. IV. Who Is that? my Uncle!


P. SE. I am abused, where is my Knave? my Broker?


LIC. Your Broker is laid out upon a bench, yonder,
Sack has seaz'd on him, in the shape of sleep.

PIC. He has been dead to us almost this hour.


P. SE This hour?


P. CA. Why sigh you Sr? 'cause he is at rest?


P. SE. It breeds my unrest.


LIC. Will you take a cup
He strikes the Sack out of his hand. And try if you can sleep?

P. SE. No, cogging Jack,
Thou and thy cups too, perish.

SHV. O, the Sack!


MAD. The sack, the sack!


P. CA. A Madrigall on Sack!


PIC. Or rather an Elegy, for the Sack is gone.


PEC. Why do you this, Sir? spill the wine, and rave?
For Brokers sleeping?

P. SE. What through sleep, and Sack,
My trust is wronged: but I am still awake,
He would have Pecunia home. But she refuses. And her Train.
To wait upon your Grace, please you to quit
This strange lewd company, they are not for you.

PEC. No Guardian, I do like them very well.


P. SE Your Graces pleasure be observed, but you
Statute, and Band, and Wax, will go with me.

SAT. Truly we will not.


BAN. We will stay, and wait here
Upon her Grace, and this your Noble Kinsman.

P. SE. Noble? how noble! who has made him noble?


P. IV. Why, my most noble money has, or shall*
My Princess, here. She that had you but kept,
And treated kindly, would have made you noble,
And wise, too: nay, perhaps have done that for you,
An Act of Parliament could not, made you honest.
The truth is, Uncle, that her Grace dislikes
Her entertainment: specially her lodging.

PEC. Nay, say her iaile. Never unfortunate Princess,
Was used so by a Iaylor. Ask my women,
Band, you can tell, and Statute, how he has used me,
Kept me close prisoner, under twenty bolts --

STA. And forty padlocks --

BAN. All malicious ingines
A wicked Smith could forge out of his iron:
As locks, and keys, shacles, and manacles,
To torture a great Lady.

STA. H'has abused
Your Graces body.

PEC. No, he would have done,
That lay not in his power: he had the use
Of our bodies, Band, and Wax, and sometimes Statutes:
But once he would ha'smother'd me in a chest,
And strangled me in leather, but that you
Came to my rescue, then, and gave me air.

STA. For which he cramb'd us up in a close box,
All three together, where we saw no Sun
In one six months.

WAX. A cruel man he is!


BAN. H'has left my fellow Wax out, in the cold,

STA. Till she was stiff, as any frost, and crumbl'd
Away to dust, and almost lost her form.

WAX. Much ado to recover me.


P. SE. Women Ieerers!
Have you learned too, the subtle faculty?
Come, I Will show you the way home, if drink,
Or, too full diet have disguised you.

BAN. Troth,
We have not any mind, Sir, of return --

STA. To be bound back to back. --

BAN. And have our legs
Turned in, or writhed about --

WAX. Or else displayed --

STA. Be lodged with dust and fleas, as we were wont --

BAN. And dyeted with dogs dung.


P. SE. Why? you whores,
My bawds, my instruments, what should I call you,
Man may think base enough for you?

P. IV. Hear you, uncle.
I must not hear this of my Princess servants,
And in Apollo, in Pecunia's room,
Go, get you down the stairs: Home, to your Kennell,
As swiftly as you can. Consult your dogs,
The Lares of your family; or believe it,
The fury of a foote-man, and a drawer
Hangs over you.

SHV. Cudgel, and pot do threaten
A kind of vengeance.

MAD. Barbers are at hand.


ALM. Washing and shauing will ensue.


FIT. The Pumpe They all threaten,
Is not far off; If It were, the sink is near:
Or a good Jordan.

MAD. You have now no money,

SHV. But are a Rascal.


P. SE. I am cheated, robbed
Ieer'd by confederacy.

FIT. No, you are kicked
And used kindly, as you should be.

SHV. Spurned, And spurn him.
From all commerce of men, who are a curre.

ALM. Kick him, out*

He exclaimes.


A stinking dog, in a dublet, with foul linen.


MAD. A snarling Rascal, hence.


SHV. Out.


P. SE. Well, remember,
I am coozen'd by my Cousin, and his whore!
Bane o'these meetings in Apollo!

LIC. Go, Sir,
One of his Dogs.
You will be tossed like Block, in a blanket else.

P. IV. Down with him, Lickfinger.


P. SE. Saucy Jack away,
Pecunia is a whore.

P. IV. Play him down, Fiddlers,
And drown his noise. Who Is this!

FIT. O Master Pyed-mantle!


ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. IV.
PYED-MANTLE. to them. Pyed-mantle brings the Lady Pecunia her pedigree. BY
your leave, Gentlemen.


FIT. Her Graces Herald,

ALM. No Herald yet, a Heraldet.


P. IV. What Is that?


P. CA. A Canter.


P. IV. O, thou said thou would sprone us all so!


P. CA. Sir, here is one will prove himself so, straight,
So shall the rest, in time.

PEC. My Pedigree?
I tell you, friend, he must be a good Scholar,
Can my descent. I am of Princely race,
And as good blood, as any is in the mines,
Runs through my veins. I am, every limb, a Princess!
Duchess of mines, was my great Grandmother.
And by the Fathers side, I come from Sol.
My Grandfather was Duke of Or, and matched
In the blood-royall of Ophyr.

PIE. Here Is his Coat.


PEC. I know it, if I hear the Blazon.


PIE. He bears
In a field Azure, a Sun proper, beamy,
Twelve of the second.

P. CA. How farr's this from canting?


P. IV. Her Grace does understand ti.


P. CA. She can cant, S^.


PEC. What be these? Besants?


PIE. Yes, an't please your Grace.


PEC. That is our Coat too, as we come from Or.
What line's this?

PIE. The rich mines of Potosi.
The Spanish mines in the West Indies.

PEC. This?


PIE. The mines of Hungary, this of Barbary.


PEC. But this, this little branch.


PEC. The Welsh-myne that.


PEC. I have Welsh-blood in me too, blaze, Sir, that Coat.


PIE. She bears (an't please you) Argent, three leekes vert
In Canton Or, and tassel'd of the first.

P. CA. Is not this canting? do you understand him?


P. IV. Not I, but it sounds well, and the whole thing
Is rarely painted, I will have such a scrowle,
What ere it cost me.

PEC. Well, at better leisure,
We'll take a view of it, and so reward you.

P. IV. Kiss him, sweet Princess, and style him a Cousin. She kisseth.


PEC. I will, if you will have it. Cousin Pyed-mantle.


P. IV. I love all men of virtue, from my Princess,
Unto my beggar, here, old Canter, on,
On to thy proof, whom prove you the next Canter?

P. CA. The Doctor here, I will proceed with the learned.
When he discourses of dissection,
Or any point of Anatomy: that he tells you,
Of Vena caua, and of vena porta,
The Meseraicks, and the Mesenterium.
What does he else but cant? Or if he run
To his Judicial Astrology,
And trowle the Trine, the Quartile and the Sextile,
Platicke aspect, and Partile, with his Hyleg
Or Alchochoden, Cuspes, and Horroscope.
Does not he cant? Who here does understand him?

ALM. This is no Canter, tho!


P. CA. Or when my Muster-Master
Talks of his Tacticks, and his Ranks, and Files;
His Bringers up, his Leaders on, and cries,
Faces about to the right hand, the left,
Now, as you were: then tells you of Redoubts,
Of Cats, and Cortines. Does not he cant?

P. IV. Yes, 'faith.


P. CA. My Eg-chind Laureat, here, when he comes forth
With Dimeters, and Trimeters, Tetrameters,
Pentameters, Hexameters, Catalecticks,
His Hyper, and his Brachy-Catalecticks,
His Pyrrhichs, Epitrites, and Choriambicks.
What is all this, but canting?

MAD. A rare fellow!


SHV. Some begging Scholar!


FIT. A decayed Doctor at least!


P. IV. Nay, I do cherish virtue, though in rags.


P. CA. And you, Mas Courtier.


P. IV. Now he treats of you,
Stand forth to him, fair.

P. CA. With all your fly-blowne proiects,
And looks out of the politics, your shut-faces,
And reserved Questions, and Answers that you game with, As
Is It a Clear business? will it manage well?
My name must not be used else. Here, 'twill dash.
Your business has received a taint, give off,
I may not prostitute my self. Tut, tut,
That little dust I can blow off, at pleasure.
Here Is no such mountain, yet, in the whole work!
But a light purse may level. I will tide
This affayre for you; give it freight, and passage.
And such mynt-phrase, as it is the worst of canting,
By how much it affects the sense, it has not.

FIT. This is some other then he seems!


P. IV. How like you him?


FIT. This cannot be a Canter!


P. IV. But he is, Sir,
And shall be still, and so shall you be too:
We'll all be Canters. Now, I think of it,
A noble Whimsie's come into my brain!
Canters-Colledge, begun to be erected.
I Will build a College, I, and my Pecunia,
And call it Canters College, sounds it well?

ALM. Excellent!


P. IV. And here stands my Father Rector,
And you Professors, you shall all profess
Something, and live there, with her Grace and me,
Your Founders: I Will endow't with lands, and means,
And Lickfinger shall be my Master-Cooke.
What? is he gone?

P. CA. And a Professor.


P. IV. Yes.


P. CA. And read Apicius de reculinaria
To your brave Doxie, and you!

P. IV. You, Cousin Fitton,
Shall (as a Courtier) read the politics;
Doctor Al-manack, he shall read Astrology,
Shunfield shall read the Military Arts.

P. CA. That Is Madrigall.
As caruing, and assaulting the cold custard.


P. IV. And Horace here, the Art of Poetry.
His Lyricks, and his Madrigalls, fine Songs,
Which we will have at dinner, steept in claret,
And against supper, sowc't in sack.

MAD. In troth
A divine Whimsey!

SHV. And a worthy work,
Fit for a Chronicle!

P. IV. Is It not?


SHV. To all ages.


P. IV. And Pyed-mantle, shall give us all our Arms,
But Picklocke, what would thou be? Thou can cant too.

PIC. In all the languages in Westminster Hall,
Fleas, Bench, or Chancery. Fee-Farme, Fee-Tayle,
Tennant in dower, At will, For Term of life,
By Copy of Court Roll, Knights service, Homage,
Fealty, Escuage, Soccage, or Frank almoigne,
Grand Sergeanty, or B^rgage.

P. IV. Thou appear'st,
(...) a Canter. Thou shall read
All Littletons tenures to me, and indeed
All my Conueyances.

PIC. And make 'hem too, Sir?
Keep all your Courts, be Steward o'your lands,
Let all your Leases, keep your Evidences,
But first, I must procure, and pass your mort-maine
You must have license from above, Sir.

P. IV. Fear not,
Pecunia's friends shall do it.

P. CA. But I shall stop it.
Your worships loving, and obedient father,
Your painful Steward, and lost Officer!
Here his father discouers himself. Who have done this, to try how you would
use
Pecunia, when you had her: which since I see,
I will take home the Lady, to my charge,
And these her servants, and leave you my Cloak,
To travel in to Beggars Bush! A Seat,
Is built already, furnished too, worth twenty
Of your imagined structures, Canters College.

FIT. It Is his Father!


MAD. He Is alive, me thinks.


ALM. I knew he was no Rogue!


P. CA. Thou, Prodigal,
Was I so careful for thee, to procure,
And plot wi' my learned Counsel, Master Picklocke,
This noble match for thee, and do thou prostitute,
Scatter thy Mistress favors, throw away
Her bounties, as they were red-burning coals,
Too hot for thee to handle, on such rascals?
Who are the scumme, and excrements of men?
If thou had sought out good, and virtuous persons
Of these professions: I'had loved thee, and them.
For these shall never have that plea against me,
Or color of advantage, that I hate
Their callings, but their manners, and their vices.
A worthy Courtier, is the ornament
Of a Kings Palace, his great Masters honor.
This is a moth, a rascal, a Court-rat,
That gnawes the commonwealth with broking suits,
And eating grieuances! So, a true Soldier,
He is his Countries strength, his Sovereigns safety,
And to secure his peace, he makes himself.
The heir of danger, nay the subject of it,
And runs those virtuous hazards, that this Scarre-crow
Cannot endure to hear of.

SHV. You are pleasant, Sir.


P. CA. With you I dare be! Here is Pyed-mantle,
'Cause he is an Ass, do not I love a Herald?
Who is the pure preserver of descents,
The keeper fair of all Nobility,
Without which all would run into confusion?
Were he a learned Herald, I would tell him
He can give Arms, and marks, he cannot honor,
No more then money can make Noble: It may
Give place, and rank, but it can give no Virtue.
And he would thank me, for this truth. This dog-Leach,
You style him Doctor, 'cause he can compile
An Almanac; perhaps erect a Scheme
For my great Madame monkey: when 't has taken
A glister, and bewrai'd the Ephemerides.
Do I despise a learned Physician?
In calling him a Quack-Saluer? or blast
The everliving ghirl^nd, always green
Of a good Poet? when I say his wreath
Is piec'd and patched of dirty witherd flowers?
Away, I am impatient of these ulcers,
(That I not call you worse) There is no sore,
Or Plague but you to infect the times. I abhor
Your very scent. Come, Lady, since my Prodigal
Knew not to entertain you to your worth,
I Will see if I have learned, how to receive you,
He points him to his patched cloak thrown off. With more respect to you,
and your fair train here.
Farewell my Beggar in velvet, for to day,
To morrow you may put on that grave Robe,
And enter your great work of Canters College,
Your work and worthy of a Chronicle,

The fourth Intermeane after the fourth Act.
TATLE. Why? This was the worst of all! the Catastrophe!


CEN. The matter began to be good, but now: and he has spoiled it all, with his
Beggar there!


MIRT. A beggarly Jack it is, I warrant him, and a kin to the Poet.


TAT. Like enough, for he had the chiefest part in his play, if you mark it.


EXP. Absurdity on him, for a huge ouergrowne Play-maker! why should he make
him live again, when they, and we all thought him dead? If he had left him to
his rags, there had been an end of him.


TAT. I, but set a beggar on horseback, he will never linne till he be a
gallop.


CEN. The young heir grew a fine Gentleman, in this last Act!


EXP. So he did, Gossip: and kept the best company.


CEN. And feasted 'hem, and his Mistress!


TAT. And showed her to 'hem all! was not jealous!


MIRTH. But very communicatiue, and liberal, and began to be magnificent, if
the churl his father would have let him alone.


CEN. It was spitefully done of the Poet, to make the Chuffe take him off in
his height, when he was going to do all his brave deeds!


EXP. To found an Academy!


TAT. Erect a College!


EXP. Plant his Professors, and water his Lectures.


MIRTH. With wine, gossips, as he meant to do, and then to defraud his
purposes?


EXP. Kill the hopes of so many towardly young spirits?


TAT. As the Doctors?


CEN. And the Courtiers! I protest, I was in love with Master Fitton. He did
wear all he had, from the hat-band, to the shooe-tye, so politically, and
would stoop, and leere?


MIRTH. And lie so, in wait for a piece of wit, like a Mouse-trap?


EXP. Indeed Gossip, so would the little Doctor, all his behavior was mere
glister! OF my conscience, he would make any parties physic in the world
work, with his discourse.


MIR. I wonder they would suffer it, a foolish old fornicating Father, to
ravish away his sons Mistress.


CEN. And all her women, at once, as he did!


TAT. I would have flyen in his gypsies face in faith.


MIRTH. It was a plain piece of political incest, and worthy to be brought
before the high Commission of wit. Suppose we were to censure him, you are the
youngest voice, Gossip Tatle, begin.


TATLE. Mary, I would have the old conicatcher coozen'd of all he has, in the
young heirs defense, by his learned Counsel, Mr Picklocke!


CENSVRE. I would rather the Courtier had found out some trick to beg him,
from his estate!


EXP. Or the Captain had courage enough to beat him.


CEN. Or the fine Madrigall-man, in rhyme, to have run him out of the
Country, like an Irish rat.


TAT. No, I would have Master Pyed-mantle, her Graces Herald, to pluck down
his hatchments, reuerse his coat armor, and nullify him for no Gentleman.


EXP. Nay, then let Master Doctor dissect him, have him opened, and his tripes
translated to Lickfinger, to make a probation dish of.


CEN. TAT. Agreed! Agreed!


MIRTH. Faith I would have him flat disinherited, by a decree of Court, bound
to make restitution of the Lady Pecunia, and the use of her body to his son.


EXP. And her train, to the Gentlemen.


CEN. And both the Poet, and himself, to ask them all forgiveness!


TAT. And us too*


CEN. In two large sheets of paper --

EXP. Or to stand in a skin of parchment, (which the Court please)


CEN. And those filled with news!


MIRTH. And dedicated to the sustaining of the Staple!


EXP. Which their Poet has let fall, most abruptly?


MIRTH. Banckruptly, indeed!


CEN. You say wittily, Gossip, and therefore let a protest go out against him.


MIR. A mourniuall of protests; or a gleeke at least!


EXP. In all our names:


CEN. For a decayed wit --


EXP. Broken --


TAT. Non-soluent --


CENSVRE. And, for ever, forfet --


MIRTH. To scorn, of Mirth?


CEN. Censure!


EXP. Expectation!


TAT. Subsign'd. Tatle, Stay, they come again.


ACT. V. SCENE. I.
PENY-BOY. IV. to him THO. BARBER. after, PICKLOCKE. He comes out in the
patchd cloak his father left him. NAy, they are fit, as they had been made for
me,
And I am now a thing, worth looking at!
The same, I said I would be in the morning.
No Rogue, at a Comitia of the Canters,
Did ever there become his Parents Robes
Better, then I do these: great fool! and beggar!
Why do not all that are of those societies,
Come forth, and gratulate me one of theirs?
Me thinks, I should be, on every side, saluted,
Dauphin of beggars! Prince of Prodigalls!
That have so fallen under the ears, and eyes,
And tongues of all, the fable of the time,
Matter of scorn, and mark of reprehension!
I now begin to see my vanity,
Shine in this Glass, reflected by the foil!
Where is my Fashioner? my Feather-man?
My Linnener? Perfumer? Barber? all?
That tail of Riot, followed me this morning?
Not one! but a dark solitude about me,
Worthy my cloak, and patches; as I had
The epidemicall disease upon me:
And I Will sit down with it.

THO. My Master! Maker!
How do you? Why do you sit thus of the ground, Sir?
Hear you the news?

P. IV. No, nor I care to hear none.
Would I could here sit still, and slip away
The other one and twenty, to have this
Forgotten, and the day rac'd out, expunged,
In every Ephemerides, or Almanac.
Or if it must be in, that Time and Nature
Have decreed; still, let it be a day
Of tickling Prodigalls, about the gills;
Deluding gaping heirs, loosing their loves,
And their discretions; falling from the favors
Of their best friends, and parents; their own hopes;
And entering the society of Canters.

THO. A doleful day it is, and dismal times
Are come upon us: I am clear undone.

P. IV. How, Thom?


THO. Why? broke! broke! wretchedly broke!


P. IV. Ha!


THO. Our Staple is all to pieces, quite dissolved!


P. IV. Ha!


THO. Shiuer'd, as in an earthquake! heard you not
The crack and ruins? we are all blown up!
Soon as they heard the Infanta was got from them,
Whom they had so devoured i'their hopes,
To be their Patroness, and soiourne with 'hem;
Our Emissaries, Register, Examiner,
Flew into vapor: our grave Governor
Into a subt'ler air; and is returned
(As we do hear) grand- Captain of the Ieerers.
I, and my fellow melted into butter,
And spoiled our Ink, and so the Office vanished.
The last hum that it made, was, that your Father,
And Picklocke are fallen out, the man of Law. He starts up at this.

P. IV. How? this awakes me from my lethargy.


THO. And a great suite, is like to be between 'hem,
Picklocke denies the Feofement, and the Trust,
(Your Father says) he made of the whole estate,
Unto him, as respecting his mortality,
When he first laid this late device, to try you.

P. IV. Has Picklock then a trust?


THO. I cannot tell,
Here comes the worshipful --

PIC. What? my velvet- heir, Picklocke enters.
Turned beggar in mind, as robes?

P. IV. You see what case,
Your, and my Fathers plots have brought me to.

P. C. Your Fathers, you may say, indeed, not mine.
He Is a hard hearted Gentleman! I am sorry
To see his rigid resolution!
That any man should so put off affection,
And humane nature, to destroy his own!
And triumph in a victory so cruel!
He Is fallen out with me, for being yours,
And calls me Knave, and Traitors to his Trust,
Says he will have me thrown over the Bar --

P. IV. Ha'you deserved it?


PIC. O, good heaven knows
My conscience, and the silly latitude of it!
A narrow minded man! my thoughts do dwell
All in a Lane, or line indeed; No turning,
Nor scarce obliquitie in them. I still look
Right forward to the intent, and scope of that
Which he would go from now.

P. IV. Had you a Trust, then?


PIC. Sir, I had somewhat, will keep you still Lord
Of all the estate, (if I be honest) as
I hope I shall. My tender scrupulous breast
Will not permit me see the heir defrauded,
And like an Alyen, thrust out of the blood,
The Laws forbid that I should give consent,
To such a civil slaughter of a Son.

P. IV. Where is the deed? have thou it with thee?


PIC. No,
It is a thing of greater consequence,
Then to be borne about in a black box,
Like a Low Country vorloffe, or Welsh-briefe.
It is at Lickfingers, under lock and key.

P. IV. O, fetch it hither.


PIC. I have bid him bring it,
That you might see it.

P. IV. Knows he what brings?


PIC. No more then a Gardiners Ass, what roots he carries,

P. IV. I was a sending my Father, like an Ass,
A penitent Epistle, but I am glad
I did not, now.

PIC. Hang him, an austere grape,
That has no juice, but what is veriuice in him.

P. IV. I Will show you my letter!


P^C. Show me a defiance!
Peny-boy runs out to fetch his letter. If I can now commit Father, and Son,
And make my profits out of both. Commence
A suite with the old man, for his whole state,
And go to Law with the Sons credit, undo
Both, both with their own money, it were a piece
Worthy my nightcap, and the Gown I wear,
A Picklockes name in Law. Where are you Sir?
What do you do so long?

P. IV. I cannot find
Where I have laid it, but I have laid it safe.

PIC No matter, Sir, trust you unto my Trust,
It Is that that shall secure you, an absolute deed!
And I confess, it was in Trust, for you,
Lest any thing might have happened mortal to him:
But there must be a gratitude thought on,
And aid, Sir, for the charges of the suite,
Which will be great, against such a mighty man,
As is our Father, and a man possessed
Of so much Land, Pecunia and her friends.
I am not able to wage Law with him,
Yet must maintain the thing, as mine own right,
Still for your good, and therefore must be bold
To use your credit for moneys.

P. IV. What thou will,
So we be safe, and the Trust bear it.

PIC. Fear not,
It Is he must pay arrerages in the end.
We Will milk him, and Pecunia, draw their cream down,
Before he get the deed into his hands.
My name is Picklocke, but hee^ll find me a Padlocke.

ACT. V. SCENE. II.
PENY-BOY. CAN. PENY-BOY. IV. PICKLOCK. THO. BARBAR. HOw now? conferring
wi'your learned Counsel,
Vpo' the Cheat? Are you of the plot to coozen me?

P. IV. What plot?


P. ^^. Your Counsel knows there, Mr Picklock,
Will you restore the Trust yet?

PIC. Sir, take patience.
And memory unto you, and bethink you,
What Trust? where do appear? I have your Deed,
Does your Deed specify any Trust? Is It not
A perfect Act? and absolute in Law?
Sealed and delivered before witnesses?
The day and date, emergent.

P. CA. But what conference?
What oaths, and vows preceded?

PIC. I will tell you, Sir,
Since I am urged of those, as I remember,
You told me you had got a grown estate,
By griping means, sinisterly.

(P. CA. How!)


PIC. And were
Even weary of it; if the parties lived,
From whom you had wrested it --

(P. CA. Ha!)


PIC. You could be glad,
To part with all, for satisfaction:
But since they'had yielded to humanity,
And that just heaven had sent you, for a punishment
(You did acknowledge it) this riotous heir,
That would bring all to beggary in the end,
And daily sowed consumption, where he went --

P. CA. You'old coozen both, then? your Confederate, too?


PIC. After a long, mature deliberation,
You could not think, where, better, how to place it --

P. CA. Then on you, Rascal?


PIC. What you please in your passion,
But with your reason, you will come about
And think a faithful, and a frugall friend
To be preferred.

P. CA. Before a Son?


PIC. A Prodigal,
A tubbe without a bottom, as you termed him;
For which, I might return you a vow, or two,
And seal it with an oath of thankfulness,
I not repent it, neither have I cause, Yet --

P. CA. Forehead of steel, and mouth of brass! has impudence
Polished so gross a lie, and dare thou vent it?
Engine, composed of all mixed mettalls! hence,
I will not change a syllab, with thee, more,
Till I may meet thee, at a Bar in Court,
Before thy Judges.

PIC. Thither it must come,
Before I part with it, to you, or you, Sir.

P. CA. His Son entreats him. I will not hear thee.


P. IV. Sir, your ear to me, though.
Not that I see through his perplexed plots,
And hidden ends, nor that my parts depend
Upon the vnwinding this so knotted skeane,
Do I beseech your patience. Unto me
He has confessed the trust.

PIC. How? I confess it?


P. IV. I thou, false man.


P. ^^. Stand up to him, and confront him.


PIC. Where? when? to whom?


P^ IV. To me, even now, and here,
Can thou deny it?

PIC. Can I eat or drink?
Sleep, wake, or dream? arise, sit, go, or stand?
Do any thing that is natural?

P. IV. Yes, lie:
It seems thou can, and periure: that is natural!

PIC. O me! what times are these! of frontlesse carriage*
An Egg of the same nest! the Fathers Bird!
It runs in a blood, I see!

P. IV. I Will stop your mouth.


PIC. With what?


P. IV. With truth.


PIC. With noise, I must have witness.
Where is your witness? you can produce witness?

P. IV. As if my testimony were not twenty,
Balanced with thine?

PIC. So say all Prodigalls,
Sick of self-love, but that is not Law, young Scatter-good.
I live by Law.

P. IV. Why? if thou have a conscience,
That is a thoussnd witnesses.

PIC. No, Court,
Grants out a Writ of Summons, for the Conscience,
That I know, nor Sub-paena, nor Attachment.
I must have witness, and of your producing,
Ere this can come to hearing, and it must
Be heard on oath, and witness.

P. IV. Come forth, Thom,
He produces Thom. Speak what thou heard'st, the truth, and the whole truth,
And nothing but the truth. What said this varlet?

PIC. A rat behind the hangings!


THO. Sir, he said
It was a Trust! an Act, the which your Father
Had will to alter: but his tender breast
Would not permit to see the heir defrauded;
And like an alyen, thrust out of the blood.
The Laws forbid that he should give consent
To such a civil slaughter of a Son --

P. IV. And talked of a gratuitie to be given,
And aid unto the charges of the suite;
Which he was to maintain, in his own name,
But for my use, he said.

P. CA. It is enough.


THO. And he would milk Pecunia, and draw down
Her cream, before you got the Trust, again.

P. CA. Your ears are in my pocket, Knave, go shake 'hem,
The little while you have them.

PIC. You do trust
To your great purse.

P. CA. I have you in a purse-net,
Good Master Picklocke, wi' your worming brain,
And wrigling ingine-head of maintenance,
Which I shall see you hole with, very shortly.
A fine round head, when those two lugs are off,
To trundle through a Pillory. You are sure
You heard him speak this?

P. IV. I, and more.


THO. Much more!


PIC. I Will prove yours maintenance, and combination,
And sue you all.

P. CA. Do, do, my gowned Vulture,
Crop in Reuersion: I shall see you coyted
Over the Bar, as Barge-men do their billets.

PIC. This it is, when men repent of their good deeds,
And would ha'hem in again -- They are almost mad!
But I forgive their Lucida Interualla.
O, Lickfinger? come hither. Where Is my writing? Pick-lock spies Lickfinger,
and asks him aside for the writing.

ACT. V. SCENE. III.
LICKFINGER. to them. I sent it you, together with your keys,

PIC. How?


LIC. By the Porter, that came for it, from you,
And by the token, you had given me the keys,
And bad me bring it.

PIC. And why did you not?


LIC. Why did you send a counter-mand?


PIC. Who, I?


LIC. You, or some other you, you put in trust.


PIC. In trust?


LIC. Your Trust's another self, you know,
And without Trust, and your Trust, how should he
Take notice of your keys, or of my charge.

PIC. Know you the man?


LIC. I know he was a Porter,
And a sealed Porter for he bore the badge
On breast, I am sure.

PIC. I am lost! a plot! I sent it!


LIC. Why! and I sent it by the man you sent
Whom else, I had not trusted.

PIC. Plague o'your trust. Picklocke goes out.
I am trussed up among you.

P. IV. Or you may be.


PIC. In mine own halter, I have made the Noose.


P. IV. What was it, Lickfinger?


LIC. A writing, Sir, Young Peny-boy discouers it, to his Father to be his plot
of sending for it by the Porter, and that he is in possession of the Deed.
He sent for it by a token, I was bringing it:
But that he sent a Porter, and he seemed
A man of decent carriage.

P. CA. 'Twas good fortune!
To cheat the Cheater, was no cheat, but justice,
Put off your rags, and be your self again,
This Act of piety, and good affection,
Has partly reconciled me to you.

P. IV. Sir.


P. C. No vows, no promises: too much protestation
Makes that suspected often, we would persuade.

LIC. Elder Peny-boy startles at the news. Hear you the News?


P. IV. The Office is down, how should we?


LIC. But of your uncle?


P. IV. No.


LIC. He Is run mad, Sir.


P. CA. How, Lickfinger?


LIC. Stark staring mad, your brother,
H'has almost killed his maid.

P. CA. Now, heaven forbid.


LIC. But that she is Cat-liu'd, and Squirrill-limb'd,
With throwing bed-staues at her: h'has set wide
His outer doors, and now keeps open house,
For all the passers by to see his justice:
First, he has apprehended his two dogs,
As being of the plot to coozen him:
And there he sits like an old worm of the peace,
Wrapped up in furs at a square table, screwing,
Examining, and committing the poor curres,
To two old cases of close stools, as prisons;
The one of which, he calls his Lollard's tower,
The Other his Blocke-house, 'cause his two dogs names
Are Block, and Lollard.

P. IV. This would be brave matter
Unto the Ieerers.

P. CA. I, If so the subject
Were not so wretched.

LIC. Sure, I met them all,
I think, upon that quest.

P. CA. 'Faith, like enough*
The vicious still are swift to show their natures.
I Will thither too, but with another aim,
If all succeed well, and my simples take.

ACT. V. SCENE. IIIJ.
He is seen sitting at his Table with papers before him. PENI-BOY. SEN.
PORTER. WHere are the prisoners?


POR. They are forth-comming, Sr,
Or coming forth at least.

P. SE. The Rogue is drunk,
Since I committed them to his charge. Come hither,
He smells him. Near me, yet nearer; breath upon me. Wine!
Wine, of my worship! sack! Canary sack!
Could not your Badge have bin drunk with fulsome Ale?
Or Beer? the Porters element? but sack!

POR. I am not drunk, we had, Sir, but one pynt,
An honest carrier, and my self.

P. SE. Who paid for it?


POR. Sir, I did give it him.


P. SE. What? and spend sixpence!
A Frocke spend sixpence! sixpence!

POR. Once in a year, Sir,

P. SE. In seven years, varlet! Know thou what thou have done?
What a consumption thou have made of a State?
It might please heaven, (a lusty Knave and young)
To let thee live some seventy years longer.
Till thou art fourscore, and ten; perhaps, a hundred.
Say seventy years* how many times seven in seventy?
Why, seven times ten, is ten times seven, mark me,
I will demonstrate to thee on my fingers,
Sixpence in seven year (use upon use)
Grows in that first seven year, to be a twelue-pence.
That, in the next, two-shillings; the third foure-shillings;
The fourth seven year, eight-shillings; the fifth, sixteen:
The sixth, two and thirty; the seventh, three-pound four,
The eighth, six pound, and eight; the ninth, twelve pound sixteen;
And the tenth seven, five and twenty pound,
Twelve Shillings. This thou art fallen from, by thy riot!
Should thou live seventy years, by spending sixpence,
Once in the seven: but in a day to wast it!
There is a Sum that number cannot reach!
Out of my house, thou pest of prodigality!
Seed of consumption! hence, a wicked keeper
Is often worse then the prisoners. There Is thy penny,
Four tokens for thee. Out, away. My dogs,
May yet be innocent, and honest. If not,
I have an entrapping question, or two more,
To put unto 'hem, a cross Intergatory,
And I shall catch 'hem; Lollard? Peace,
What whispring was that you had with Mortgage, He calls forth Lollard, and
examines him.
When you last licked her feet? The truth now. Ha?
Did you smell she was going? Put down that. And not,
Not to return? You are silent. good. And, when
Leaped you on Statute? As she went forth? Consent.
There was Consent, as she was going forth.
'Twould have been fitter at her coming home, He commits him again.
But you knew that she would not? To your Tower,
You are cunning, are you? I will meet your craft.
Block, show your face, leave your caresses, tell me, Calls forth Block, and
examines him.
And tell me truly, what affronts do you know
Were done Pecunia? that she left my house?
None, say you so? not that you know? or will know?
I fear me, I shall find you an obstinate Curre.
Why, did your fellow Lollard cry this morning?
'Cause Broker kicked him? why did Broker kick him?
Because he pist against my Ladies Gown?
Why, that was no affront? no? no distaste?
You knew of none. Yo'are a dissembling Tyke, Commits him.
To your hole, again, your Blocke-house. Lollard, arise,
Where did you lift your leg up, last? against what? Lollard is called again.
Are you struck Dummerer now? and whine for mercy?
Whose Kirtle was it, you gnawed too? Mistress Bands?
And Waxe's stockings? who did? Block bescumber
Statutes white suite? wi' the parchment lace there?
And Brokers Satin dublet? all will out.
They had offense, offense enough to quit me.
Block is su^mon'd the second time. Appear Block, fough, it is manifest. He
shows it,
Should he for-sweare't, make all the Affadauits,
Against it, that he could before the Bench,
And twenty Iuries; he would be conuinc'd.
He is remanded- He bears an air about him, does confess it!
To prison again, close prison. Not you Lollard,
You may enjoy the liberty of the house,
Lollard has the liberty of the house.
And yet there is a quirke come in my head,
For which I must commit you too, and close,
Do not repine, it will be better for you.

Come you to force the prisoners? make a rescue?

FIT. We come to bail your dogs.

They stand committed without bail, or mainprise,
Your bail cannot be taken.

We come to vex you.

ACT. V. SCENE. VI.
PENY-BOY. CA. PENY-BOY. SE. PENI-BOY. IV. PECVNIA. TRAIN. YOu see by this
amazement, and distraction,
What your companions were, a poor, affrighted,
And guilty race of men, that dare to stand
No breath of truth: but conscious to themselves
Of their no-wit, or honesty, ran routed
At every Pannicke terror themselves bred.
Where else, as confident as sounding brass,
Their tinckling Captain, Cymbal, and the rest,
Dare put on any visor, to deride
The wretched: or with buffo^ license, jest
At whatsoever is serious, if not sacred.

P. SE. Peny-boy Se. acknowledges his elder brother.
Who Is this? my brother! and restored to life!


P. CA Yes, and sent hither to restore your wits:
If your short madness, be not more then anger,
Conceived for your loss! which I return you.
See here, your Mortgage, Statute, Band, and Wax,
Without your Broker, come to abide with you*
And vindicate the Prodigal, from stealing
Away the Lady. Nay, Pecunia her self,
Is come to free him fairly, and discharge
All ties, but those of Love, unto her person,
To use her like a friend, not like a slave,
Or like an Idol. Superstition
Does violate the Deity it worships:
No less then scorn does. And believe it, brother
The use of things is all, and not the Store;
Surfeit, and fullness, have killed more then famine.
The Sparrow, with his little plumage, flies,
While the proud Peacocke, ouer-charg^d with pens,
Is feign to sweep the ground, with his grown train,
And load of feathers.

P. SE. Wise, and honored brother!
None but a Brother, and sent from the dead,
As you are to me, could have altered me:
I thank my Destiny, that is so gracious.
Are there no pains, no Penalties decreed
From whence you come, to us that smother money,
In chests, and strangle her in bags.

P. CA. O, mighty,
Intolerable fines, and mulcts impo'sd!
(Of which I come to warn you) forfeitures
Of whole estates, if they be known, and taken!

P. SE. I thank you Brother for the light you have given me,
I will prevent 'hem all. First free my dogs,
Lest what I have done to them (and against Law)
Be a Premuniri, for by Magna Charta
They could not be committed, as close prisoners,
My learned Counsel tells me here, my Cook.
And yet he showed me, the way, first.

LIC. Who did? I?
I trench the liberty of the subjects?

P. CA. Peace,
Picklocke, your Ghest, that Stentor, has infected you,
Whom I have safe enough in a wooden collar.

P. SE. Next, I restore these servants to their Lady,
With freedom, heart of cheer, and countenance;
It is their year, and day of Iubilee.

TRA. We thank you, Sir.


P. SE. And lastly, to my Nephew,
I give my house, goods, lands, all but my vices, Her Train thanks him.

And those I go to cleanse; kissing this Lady
Whom I do give him too, and join their bands.

P. CA. If the Spectators will join theirs, we thanke'hem.


P. IV. And wish they may, as I, enjoy Pecunia.


PEC. And so Pecunia her self does wish,
That she may still be aid unto their uses,
Not slave unto their pleasures, or a Tyrant
Oner their fair desires; but teach them all
The golden mean: the Prodigal, how to live,
The sordid, and the covetous, how to dye,
That with sound mind; this safe frugality.

THE END.
The Epilogue.
THus have you seen the Makers double scope,
To profit, and delight; wherein our hope
Is, though the clout we do not always hit,
It will not be imputed to his wit:
A Tree so tried, and bent, as'twill not start.
Nor does he often crack a string of Art,
Though there may other accidents as strange
Happen, the weather of your looks may change,
Or some high wind of mis-conceit arise,
To cause an alteration in our Skies;
If so, we'are sorry that have so misspent
Our Time and Tackle, yet he'is confident,
And vow's the next fair day, he will have us shoot
The same match over for him, if you will come to it.
