Here begins a little treatise called the co^trauerse between a lover and a
Iaye lately compyled.

Though laureate poets in old antyquyte
Feigned fables under clowdy sentence
yet some intytuled fruytefull moralyte
Some of love wrote great cyrcumstaunce
Some of cheuaulrous acts made remembrance
Some as good phylosophres naturally endyted
Thus wisely and wyttely their time they spended.
Ouyde of love made matters wonderful
Good to be known for eschewynge more evil
But Calunace and Tybull with style much paynful
Tenderly wrote of love dylectable
Gallus and Sappho ben nothing profitable
For young folks to read oflusty courage
Lest they be taged in Uenus bondage
Cancer flower of rethoryke eloquence
Compyled books pleasant and meruayllous
After him noble Gower expert in science
wrote moralytyes herd and delycyous
But Lydgates works are fruytefull and sentencyous
who of his books has read the fine
He will him call a famus rethorycyne
young Steven Hawse whose soul god pardon
Treated of love so clerkely and well
To read his works is mine affection
which he compyled for Labell pusell
Remembrynge stories fruytefull and delectable
I little or naught expert in poetry
Oflamentable love has made a dytty.
Here behynneth the (...).
IN an arbere.
Late as I were
The fowls to here
was mine entente
Singing in fere.
with notes clear
They made good chere
On bows bente
Their tewnes sweet
Moved me to sleep
Ferther to flete
I could not restrain
To take my rest
Me thought it best
It was my lust
Still to remain.
The flowers florysshed
The trees burnysshed
The odoure me nourysshed
with great suauyte
That still I lay
All the long day
In sport and play
By songs of melody.
Me thought in slombre
I herd a lover
without recover
Cryenge alas.
My loueswikynde.
That did me bind
Has changed her mind.
For no trespace.
with rewfull song.
His hondes he wrong
Endurynge long.
His heart was through.
Both earth and heaven.
with planettes seven.
Might here his steven
where he did go.
His color reed
was pale as leede
Like alshes deed
For grievous pain
In heart can dare
And lothely fare
In gretter care*
was never man.
His heart was faynte.
For great complaynte.
His here he rent
without pity.
And fell to the ground
Often times that stounde.
with mortal wound
He cried on hye.
Amator.
O heart vnfayne.
Thou may complain
Of thy lemman
And lady sweet.
For lack of comfort
Or goodly sport
Thou must resort
And wayle and weep
O pains outragyous.
Great and contagyous.
No myrthe solacyous.
May you abate
But ever to renew.
And ever to extewe.
She is untrue
Alack Alack.
O inward sorrow
Both even and morrow
Saint George to borowe.
Thou have great wrong
without on thought
Auaylynge naught
For love has wrought.
The in such thronge
O wonderful love
That me did move
without reprove
Of thought untrue
O love right clean
As Phoebus beme
Sith the first time
That I the knew
O love constrained.
O love sore payned
O love not feigned
O love of liking
where is thy solace
where is thy maystres
where in thy gladness
where is thy swetynge.
O gentle flower
Reclayme thy paramoure
wounded right sore
with loves lance
Reclayme reclayme
And think no shame
Exyle dysdayne
From your remembrance
Let pity led
your womanhede
And mercy guide
your tender aege
O famus pucell
Meke courtoys and gentell
Semynge to be right well
Ofnoble parentage
Return return
Behold I mourn
was never none borne
That love more grieved.
Full little it ywys.
Know ye I guess
what pain it is
To love vnloued
Alas o nature
why did ye figure.
So fair a creature
Of flesh and bone
Except that she
To love would plye
And have pity
On her true man
O cupyde king
Of love and loving
Great is thy werkynge
And vyolent power
Constrayne constrayne
To me a gain
Mine own lemman
And paramoure.
O Uenus high
Of gods chief
Behold my grefe
And woeful chere
Redress my smerte
And cause my sweet heart
Shortly reuerte
To her prysonere
O meruaylous fortune
That health domynyon
And in thy bandon
Every living wight
Help to prevail
My paynfull travail.
I weep and I wayle
Both day and night
Sith you me brought
To love unsought
Me think you ought
Be reason good.
To wound her sore
With dyntes of armoure
That pity poor
May change her mode.
O death do swerve
My heart vain to carue
That I may sterue.
My life is lorne.
He fell in swowne
Recouerynge soon
He set him down.
Under a thorn.
The auctoure.
The vyrdes about
Sange in a route
With to wnes stout.
Of armony.
Him to aswage
Falling in rage.
Otloues bondage.
For his lady.
Could not refrain.
His mortal pain
But did complain
With heaviness
Alas said he
What cause has she
Unkynde to be.
For no trespace.
Graculus loquitur amatori.
In that affraye.
A Jangling Iaye
Sange on a spraye
Both two and fro
Thou careful man
That does complain
In heart vnfayne
Why do thou so.
Amator.
With woeful chere
And sorrows sere.
Was naught afere
Truth to report
That unkindness
Of his may stresse
Was paynfulnesse.
Without comfort.
Graculus.
To set thy mind
On one unkind.
Thy wits were blind
yet nevertheless
Thyselfe to spyll
Do way be still
For after trouble
Comes Ioyfulnesse.
Exyle dyspayre
To mirth repair
For sorrow and care
Avails naught
To good request
Be always pressed
For wit is be
when it is bought
Amator.
Her beauty pure
And countenance demure.
Is prynted sure
In mine heart rote
No remedy
But I must dye
without that she
will be my bote.
with great tourment
And syghes fervent
I make complaynte
To god above.
was never wight.
So doulefully dyght
By day nor night
And all for love.
Erly or late
No rest I take
But for her sake
Mourns still
Trusting for grace
But none can pourchace
Adue alas God knows my will.
Graculus.
Sith fortunes chance
Has made instaunce
The to auaunce
In venus play
Beware again
Of false dysdayne
That with gyle and train
will the betraye.
when thou wenest leest
And trusts best
Thou shalt be first
Desceyued in deed
For love is vain
And never certain
But full of pain.
And folly to mede.
Love is delycyous
Love is prymerose
Love is more precious
Than gold and tapasyon
Love is a pretty cage
For fowls of tender aege
Love is but dotage
when we have all done.
Love is great pleasure
To every young creature
Love is a treasure.
That wastes fast
Love is comfortable
Love is often varyable
Love is deceyuable
And naught at the last
what thing is love.
That so does move.
Feign would I prove
How it does come
Nothing love is
But nature I guess
And from nature it comes.
By faithful affection.
Though nature move
And bydde the love
yet wisdom would prove.
Or it be hot
when fortune sour
Does on the lowre
Thou getest an owre
In cock lorels bote.
Auyse the well.
And take good counsel
Thou have fre will
To rule and guide
For love is dangerous
False and contagyous
And as sure as a mouse
Tied at a threde.
I can not contrary
But man's most felycyte
Is close in femynyte
By affection natural
yet trewly it is but folly
To love contynually
A thing that is transytory
And not perpetual
Thou may take ensample.

Of Medea and Lucresse

And fades as a flower.
while fortune was frendely
And turned her whele kyndely
They had much felycyte.
In love and liking.
Great was their affection
In carnal dylectacyon
Now are they all gone.
For all their loving.
Penelope was faithful
Cyrcys was deceytefull
Neobe was careful
And Hester was good
Their padyandes are past
And ours wastes fast
Nothing does aye last
But the grace of god.
Therefore well consider
This worlds Joy is slyder
Nothing is more sweter
And decays so soon
with reason be content
For fere thou repent
To my counsel consent
And let love alone.
Amator.
O foul of fayrenesse.
Sweet are thy stories
That thou do express
To me in doloure
Yet nevertheless
Nature is fresshe
And wounds me doubtelesse
with dyntes of armoure
I know right well
No love is durable
when fortune unstable
Tourneth her face
On wretches to wrythe
And her power kythe.
Be they wroth or blythe
She changes their solace.
yet my poor heart
Can not away sterte
From the penetable darte
Of blind Cupydo
His daughter will
wounds me still
with pains vnmedsynable
where ever I go.
Thus am I wrapped.
And in woe vnbelapped
Such love has me trapped.
without any cure
Sir Trystram the good
For his lemman I soude
More sorrow never bode
Then I do endure.
Lamwell and Lamaroke.
Gawayne and Launcelorte
Garathe and Craddocke
with the table round.
Sir Beuys / sir Eglamoure
Sir Terry / sir Tryamoure
In more grievous doloure
was never in bound
Phedra and theseus
Progne and Thereus
Pasyphe and Taurus
who lyketh to prove
Canace and Machareus
Galathea and Pamphylus
was never more dolorous.
And all for true love.
Dydo and Deydamya
Leda and Lanynya
Marra and Medusa
And Tomyrys so hynde.
Candacys and Cyrene
Calysto and Cydyppe
was never none like me
In true heart and mind.
Treusa and Cletemnestra
Smylax and Latona
Bybles and Atalanta
Ofarcady the queen
Daphnys Hypermestra
Dyrce and Cloylea
Hypolyte and Dyana
All these lovers has been
I have serched of late
Many poet laureate.
That diverse books did make
And stories regystred
Yet in comparyson.
Of my true affecoyon
Scarsely can I find one
Sith Troylus reigned
That was true and faithful.
In love that is paynfull
without fraud dysceytefull
Or preuy strife.
Therefore as I find
I will show my mind
Right few of Gryseldes kind
Is now left on live.
This world is altered
Condycyons are changed
As is daily proved
By true experyence
Trust is now treachery
And love is but Lechery.
All things decays daily
without repentance
Though I more speak
My heart will break
So love will wreke
On me with tene
Fare well delectacyon
welcome my fortune
I must be content with reason
As other has been.
Graculus.
For thy dystresse
And geuynesse.
I will express
In words plain
That women frail
Are seldom leale
The truth to tell
I will not layne.
Thy will consent
And soon repent
It is them lent
And given by nature.
Therefore beware
To prove over far
For to loves daungere
They will the flatter
Their words soft blandysshynge
Are quaynte with flaterynge
And with countenance faynynge
They can make it nyse
Covered above falsely
Forgynge frauds craftily
That they have brought many
To a foles paradyse.
Like serpents furyous
Among flowers odyous.
Their venyme hydeous
Remains still
The seugre appears
The gall behind leueth
what man that proves
Shall like them fullyll
Their speches is amyable
Their hertes are chaungeable
Their minds are varyable
with mutabylyte
They are worthy no praise
They are so tempred with always
And as Guydo says
They are never in suretye
Interes they seem careful
And inwardly they are dysceytefull
Right few that be faithful
For sykernes
They will speak fair outward
And think the contrary
Thus do they always vary
without doubleness.
Record of Cresyde
whom Troylus loved
And was sore payned
Canset does tell
Her love was feigned
And wortely changed.
And given to Dyomede
with greeks to dwell
who trusts them best
He shall be the first
Desceyued I trust
By fortune even
Than may he go
where he came fro
with sorrow and Woe
Jack vnshryuen.
Often times they smyle
In loves style
And does begyle
young lovers faynte
with sportes and plays
But now a days
He that truth says
He shall be shente
Uery few or none.
Is content with one
But as the moon
Oftentimes they change
Therefore let a man.
Do as well as he can
For little brytayne
Is no graunge
Search scripture and polesy
Crownacle and philosophy
The frauds of femynyte
with gylefull train.
Has brought to confusyon
Many a chief champyon
As Sampson and Salamon
whose stories are plain
Dauyd the conqueroure
Arystotle the phylosophre
Hercules and Arthure.
with many other mo.
Defamed was craftily
Thrughe women's fraylte
Answer let us se
Is it not so.
Many cytees and towns
Many countres and regyons
Many Earls Dukes and Barons
Destroyed has been
Many a king and Emperor
And bold knights of adventure
Has dyed with doloure
And all for women
Pryamys and Paris
Hector and Achylles
Patraclus and Palomydes
Dyepholus a roy
Many a noble freke
Of Asye and of Greek
For fair Helyns sake
was slain at the syege of troy
How should I more write
Or yet endyte
My heart does weep
To think thereupon
what myschefe what murmr
what slaundre and manslaughter
what dysdayne and what murdre
That has been for women
Ferther to proceed
Me think no need
To regystre in deed
Their propertyes peryllous
Yet who would here
Mocraftes of them sere
Let him read and lere
Guydo and Secundus
Thus in conclysyon
women are confusyon
And fynall destruccyon
To man at the end
yet shame it is
To blame them doubtelesse
For as clerks says
They have it of kind.
Therefore remember
Their young ages tender.
That to love is egre
with lusty courage.
To love in youth
Is pleasure enough
And in age forsothe
It is but dotage
Trust not their words.
Nor merry bourdes
For knights and lords
Desceyued have been.
They are often mutable
They are false and varyable
Therefore trust them but little
For all their fair eyes.
Take comfort good
And change thy mode
For by the sweet rode
They turn as the wide
On the sea I have bend
And many Ieoperdyes seen
what need I more to rekyn
Thou know my mind
Remember well I say
I must away
Passed is the day
I may not abide
She took her flight
And flewe forth right
And the woeful wight
Fast after yede
The auctoure
with that I awoke
And took my book
Thereon to look
was my solace
Like as I herd
I was not aferde
But word by word
I wrote this treatise.
Finis.
Lenuoye of the auctoure.
Golytell book with rudenes replete
Present the humbly before lecture lytterall
Excusing thy maker by Way or by street
And pronounce thy sentence with language lyberal
Pray them to correct thy pains rustycall
For made thou was of short aduysement
Be meruayllous instaunce of a lover verament.
Feigned thou art with words approbryous.
Regystrynge the acts and (...) of women
That some men will Juge the enuyous.
Nay truly than were he to blame
This is his mind and entendement certain
Where as they read and find them gyltye
Let them amend this counsel gives he.
Who lyketh thy sentence and pondureth it right
Contectynge well in his remembrance
Know may he truly that by a lady bright
Thou was compyled by pastymes pleasant.
Such great unkindness which caused varyaunce
Was showed to a lover called. F. T.
Her name also begins with. A. B.

lately compyled by me Thomas Feylde.
