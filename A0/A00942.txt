A Batchelers Resolution. OR
Have among you now, Widows or Maids,
For I come a woing as Fancy persuades.
I must have a Wife, be she Older or Younger,
For I cannot, nor will not lie alone any longer.
To the tune of, The Blazing Torch.


A Batchelour I have been long,
and had no mind to marry,
But now I find it did me wrong
that I so long did tarry,
Therefore I will a wooing ride,
there is many married younger,
Where shall I go to s^ke a Bride?
I Will lie alone no longer.
So many sins are incident
unto a single life,
That I all danger to pr^uent
with speed will seek a Wife;
If I with Women chance to drink
I Am called a ^utton-monger,
But now I Will stop their mouths I think
And lie alone no longer.
O Fate send me a handsome Less
that I can fancy well,
For Portion I Will not greatly pass,
though Money hears the bell*
Love now adays with Gold is bought
but I Am no Money-monger.
Give me a Wife, though she is worth naught
I Will lie alone no longer.
Yet if she chance to prove a Slut,
a Scold, or else a Whore,
That could not choose but be a cut,
and (...) me very sore,
A Slut would make me loath my meat
were I half dead with hunger,
But I must leave this fond conceate,
And lie alone no longer.
What if she should a Wanton be,
a(...)ache my forehead ache?
Oh that would be a grief to me,
such wrongs few men will take,
For jealousy is of such force,
no passion can be stronger,
But be she better, be she worse,
I Will lie alone no longer.
If jealous she shall be of me,
that were as great a spite,
Then should we seldom quiet be,
but quarrel day and night,
She Would think my love from her did range
though I nere meant to wrong her,
Yet this shall not my humor change,
I Will lie alone no longer.
What shall I do to choose a wife
in every thing complete?
Should I in searching spend my life,
i'would prove a task to great,
No Man can find a Woman so,
the older nor the younger,
I Will take my chance as others do,
And lie alone no longer.
Yet will I choose the best I can,
^oue send me luck in choosing,
And crave the counsel of some man
whose counsels worth the using:
If she prove good I shall be glad,
and vow I Will never wrong her,
Yet am resolved good or bad
To lie alone no longer.
The second Part. To the same tune.


I^e be contented with my lot,
How ever it befall,
Yet if she prove a drunken sot,
^^^ill grieve me worst of all,
Then I my self must drink small-beere,
and she must drink the stronger,
Though It cost me twenty pounds a year,
I Will lie alone no longer.
This is the only time I know,
for Young Men to get Wives,
Thou say that Maids and Widows now
for Husbands daily strives,
The^^^ore I shall be quickly sped,
since both for Husbands hunger,
with any man th^yle quickly wed,
They Will lie alone no longer.
Be she a widow or a Maiyde,
I do not greatly pass,
A withered Crone whose bla^d's decade,
or a young li^ely Less:
One that is rich or one that is poor,
a feeble, or a stronger:
An honest woman or a whore,
I Will lie alone no longer.
But ye^ if I (...) choice may have
a Maid ^ould b^ my wife,
I would not be a Widows slave,
I Would rather loose my life:
If I should wed a Widow old,
I ^ad better take a younger,
For Widows will not be contrould,
Yet I can stay no longer.
If she should have a stinking breath
I never should abide her,
For tha^ to me is worse then death,
I had rather touch a Spider:
But that's a fault may soon be smelt,
s^e Ajax smells no stronger:
before I^e take one with such fault,
(...) lie alone yet longer
If she chance to prove a Scould,
her tongue will breed my strife,
Then I must look to be contrould,
and curbed by my Wife:
A Scould of women is the worst,
shele force a man to wrong her:
Therefore I Will try all humors first,
And lie alone no longer.
Some men perhaps may wonder, why
my mind runs so on Marriage,
To him that asks me, I reply,
it is for my honest carriage:
For live a young man nere so chaste,
he is counted a Whoremonger:
Therefore I Will get a Wife in haste,
And lie alone no longer.
Although my Wife be none oath best,
yet I must be content:
I shall as well speed as the rest,
whith 'bout this action went:
I am not first that matched ill,
therefore it is no wonder:
I Will keep my resolution still,
And lie alone no longer.
I trust I shall with one be sped,
that does deserve my love:
If I with such a Woman wed,
I swear by mighty love,
That ere she any thing should (...)
I Will suffer cold and hunger:
Though she had scant clothes
I Would lie alone no longer.
You that my resolution hear
judge whether I deserve
To have a Wife that love
and would my will obser^
Were she a Widow or a (...)
an Elder, or a Younger
My Wedding should not be
