A RETRACTIVE FROM THE ROMISH RELIGION:

Containing THIRTEEN FORCIBLE MOTIVES, dissuading from communion with the
CHVRCH of ROME:

Wherein is demonstratiuely proved, that the now Romish Religion (so far
forth as it is Romish) is not the true CATHOLIC Religion of CHRIST, but the
seduction of ANTICHRIST:

might be saved: therefore God shall send them strong delusion, to believe lies.

TO THE TRVELY VIRTUOUS, AND WORTHY KNIGHT, SIR OLIVER CROMWELL, T. B. wishes
increase of grace and all happiness.
SIR,
THERE be many particular respects that move me to be bold, to set your name
in the frontispice of this work: As first, your sincere love to true Religion,
and the Professors thereof: Secondly, your true detestation of the Romish
Synagogue, and the malignant influences of those wandering Planets, that infect
the air of our Church, and seek by mining, poisoning, and other deuillish
practices, to turn our Jerusalem into Babel. Thirdly, for that your self,
with your religious Lady, worthy children, and brethren, and great family, have
been a long time the principal auditors of my unworthy ministry, wherein
many of these points have been delivered upon occasion, that you may see them
here more fully discoursed, and so be the better confirmed in the truth. And
lastly, the particular obligations of love and duty, wherewith I am bound unto
you for many extraordinary favors and kindnesses received. These be the
motives, that have moved me to select your self principally above all others
to dedicate these motives unto. For the which I desire no more patronage and
protection, then the truth of the several points contained therein do
deserve. Let them stand upon their own legs, or fall and perish. I know, they
shall encounter with many bitter oppositions, and sharp adversaries, who will
be ready to sift every sentence, and to find a knot in a bull-rush: but my
shelter is the buckler of truth, and the brazen wall of a good conscience; with
which being armed, I hope, through Gods aid, that I shall be as willing and
able to entertayne the re-encounter, if any assault be made, as I was willing
to give this onset: I confess that these are not the tithe of the arguments,
that might be produced against the Romish religion, yet I doubt not, but that
even these few may serve, both to discover the falsehood thereof, and to
confirm and strengthen those that stagger, and are weak in the truth: the
Lord accompanying these endeavors of his servant with his blessing, as I hope,
and pray that he would be pleased to do. These motives, such as they are, I
willingly desire may be graced by your name, hoping that your name shall no way
be disgraced by them: accept them therefore, as tokens of my sincere love to
your self, and zeal to the truth, for which I desire no other requital, but
an augmentation of your zeal to the same truth, and a greater detestation of
that Religion, which already you abhor. The Lord of his mercy increase in you
more and more all spiritual graces for your souls health, and multiply his
blessings temporal upon your head, and crown you with glory, and immortality
eternal in the life to come.

Your worships most affectionate and devoted, THO. BEARD.

REVERENDIS, DILECTISQVE IN CHRISTO FRATRIBVS, Pijs ET FIDELIBVS Euangelij
Ministris, per omnem Britanniam constitutis, gratia, and pax a DEO PATRE, and
DOMINO nostro IESV CHRISTO.
NOn estis nescij (fratres and (...) in Christo) quanta nos Euangelij
Ministros, tum verborum maledicentia, tum animorum odio insectentur, Cleri
Pontificij cohors and colluuies vniuersa. Sua in nos omnis gener^^ tela, and
quidem venenata confertim conijciunt; famam nostram canino dente, and studio
allatrant, atque admordent; quin and ipsas adeo gulas nostras, and quidem eas
nobis incisuri, app^tunt, si illorum in nos maleuolentiae par ad facinus potest
as responderet: nomen ipsum ministri, perinde atque veteribus Iudaeis
Samaritae, illis itae putet and foetet, vt sine nausea, and indignatione, illud
ne nominare quidem possunt. Huiuscemodi conuitijs and contumelijs libricorum
passim and plaerique omnes referti, onustique sunt. Cuius si intestini and
inexplebilis odij rations libeat perquirere, quinque istas quas ordine
percensebo praec^teris insigniores, and ex ijs principem hanc reperietis. Quod
Clerus hic Pontificius, Monachorum cum primis and fraterculorum, locustae illae
sunt in Apocalypsi Apoc. 9. 3.
commemoratae, quae caudis similiter vt scorpi^ cu^pidatis, de infernalis putei
fumo prodeuntes, terminitam quinque mensium spatio homines excruciandi
potestatem accepere: Qu^ ex re fit, vt vbi possunt quidem and valent, ibi ferro
flammaque in nos grassentur: vbi autem hoc illis non licet, linguas and calamos
exacuant atque distringant: consimili plane atque ille ^ngenio praediti, de quo
est apud Poetam,

Et si non aliqua nocuisset, mortuus esset. Virg. Eclog. 3.


Haereticorum enim (vt est scriptum ab Hieronymo) hoc semper caco^thes fuit, vt
conuicti de perfidia, ad maledicta se conferant. Sequitur hanc causam isthaec
altera. Quod luci cum tenebris nulla societas, nullum commercium intercedat: Ac
nos quidem lucis Ministri sumus, qui adomnes quibus non sponte oculi
caecutiunt, Euangelij claritatem quaqua versum diffundimus. Illi
contratenebrarum satellites sunt, qui dum scripturarum lectione plarosque
arcent and prohibent, dum fidem quam vocant implicitam, nos Carbonariam,
tanquam apprime salutarem, maximeque necessariam praedicant, and commendant,
densissimis sane crassissimisque tenebris hominum anim^^ circumfundunt. Istis
porro causis annumeranda est haec tertia, quod nullum tam capitale odium solet
esse, atque quod religionis causa suscipitur, tum nos religionis illi^^
praecones sum^^, quae illorum superstitioni vsque adeo aduersa est, nulla vt
ratione conuenire, nalla conciliari art inter sepossunt. Ex quo id existit,
quod nec Turcas quidem and Iud^^s, nec ipsos adeo Ethnicos, quamuis Christiani
nominis hosts infestissimos pariter vt Protestants, and Euangelij Ministros
detestentur. Cuires indicio est illa, quam Hispanicam appellant, inquisitio;
testis etiam locuples. Rom^ ipsa, in qua sub ipsius sane ore Pontificis, Turcis
and Iudaeis tuta consuetudo, atque periculo omni libera and immunis negotiatio
est: siquem autem nostrae religionis vel leuissime suspectum esse contingat,
^um vel aperta vi, vel occultis insiaijs ad internecionem vsque persequuntur.
Quid autem causae est, quaeso, quod tanta in nos solos immanitate furoreque
debacchentur? Hoc quidem certe: quod non tam ipsormn religioni, quam Christo
ipsi, Turcae and Iudaei inimici infestique sunt: nobis de illorum
superstitione, de mundano fastu and splendore, de temporali and terrena
potentia, quaeijs Christo ipso multo chariora poti^raque sunt, certamen cum
illis pugnaque est. Iam tribus istis causis accedit qu^rta, quod percussis
gregum arietibus, dissipari greges ipsos, and perire necessum sit: quod cum
illi vehementissime desiderent, nec efficere tamen per nos possint, hinc illae
scilicet lachrymae, hinc atrox in nos odium, hinc rabiosa libido commouetur.
Quinta restat causa, quod (vt sunt sagaces) eos nos esse animaduertunt, qui non
greges modo nostros ab illis integros and sinceros custodimus, verum arictinis
cornibus, sacrarum videli^et scripturarum pr^dication^, muros etiam
Ieric^untinos demolimur, mancipia nimirum Papa* Babylonicae seruitutis iugo
^ripimus, atque dolos eorum, and insidias, pariter vt errores detegimus: nihil
vt ^it miri, si quos iam vrgentis aut certe aduentantis ruinae suae authors,
and effectores norunt esse, in eos acerbitatis suae virus, quantum maxim
possunt, euomant and ebulliant. Atque hae sane maliciae illius serpentinae,
odijque insatiabilis, quo in nos surenter invehantur praecipuae causae sunt.
Quid igitur? mutuum ne cum illis faciemus, quod eos remor deat? Non assentior:
quin potius quo eorum in nos odium magis exar descit, eo amor vt in illos
noster vehementius inflammetur, author sum, quo ardentes eorum in capita
carbones sic congeramus, quibus vel incendantur ad charitatem, vel consumantur
ad perniciem. An vero animos despondebimus, stationesque deseremus, ac ne
offensioni ijs simus, militiae nostrae arma abijciemus? Hoc nimirum est, quod
illi vel inprimis certe auent, and expetunt. At nos contra ex veneno eorum
(iuxta Ambrosij consilium) Antidotum nobis Ambros. lib. 1. de poenit. c. 13.
contra eos ipsos conficiamus, atque co in pugna acriores simus maiorique
alacritate contendamus. Caetera sane omnia, facultates, famam, liberos, vitam
adeo ipsam diripi Luther.
sinamus nobis and abripi, fidem autem, and veritatem eripi ne patiamur:
maledicta sit haec omnis humilitas, hic quiuis pertinax, and superbus esse
debet (vt optime Lutherus.) Papae, quod scitis, Emissarij per agros, per vrbes
errabundi discur sant, ac diuagantur, loca omnia, domos omnes, and angulos
tanquam ranae Aegyptiacae penetrant, and perreptant, suisque coaxationibus
afflant a^que inficiunt, Aridam (ad veterum Pharisaeorum morem) and Maria
circumeunt, nec vllam lapidem mouere praeter mittunt, aut etiam intermittunt,
Romanae vt Ecclesiae proselytos adiungant, and religionis suae terminos
proferant and dilatent, and nos interim segnitie ignauiaque torpescemus? vt
iugulent homines surgent de nocte latrones: vt teipsum serves non
expergisceris? Si versante iam in visceribus, ac ipsum poene iugulum praensante
atque premente host, securi agimus; quid hoc instituto aliud, a^t speremus aut
consequamur, quam vt veritatis, religionis, Christi, nostrae denique ipsorum
vitae atque animae, quibus hi lupi quam dolis insidiantur, tam plenis faucibus
inhiant, verissimi proditores habeamur. Neque haec tamen eo a me dicuntur
(fratres) quod suspecta sit mihi fides vestra, verum vt spo^te, and quidem
probe iam diu currentes, ad stadium contentius decurrendum incitem, and
impellam: ne quis vestrum (quod Deus prohibeat) (...) ad extremum excidat,
coronamque amittat. Fateor equidem (vt hic repugnent, and reclamitent
Pontificij nostri) post restitutam apud nos Euangelij lucem, nunquam aut plura,
aut illustriora lumina isthic effulsisse, and beatam propter hocipsum Angliam
nostram, foelices item Academias, quae has nobis stellas accend^re, hancque tam
numerosam sobolem tum parturiere, tum peperere agnosco, and praedico. Atqui
verendum tamen, neque omnino negandum, non exiguum etiam segnium inertiumque
fucorum numerum, qui mel quidem comedunt, and liguriunt, fauos autem and
praesepia, neque curant, nec recipient, passim apud nos volitarem. Quos
meminerint suadeo vocem illam Iudicis, quam aliquando certe audituri sunt,
Read rationem villicationis tuae. Vos autem (fratres) qui diutius in exercitu
and procinctu stetistis, hortor and precor, forti vt animo and invicto, in
inchoato iam praelio perseueret is, and cum, linguas vestras, tum calamos,
contra Antichristianae militiae conatus omnes instruatis. Hac in mess
desudemus omnes, suum quisque ad Sanctuarium reaedificandum siclum afferamus:
quippe quorum omnium nemo tam tenui apparatu instructuve est, quin ad hoc
conficiendum negotium confer aliquantillum possit. Ego certe ex gregarijs
militibus minimus, nedum vt me dignum deputem, qu^ in triarijs numerer, qualium
quamplurimi hoc in bello stipendia sub Christo merent, iter vobis praeiui, and
viam quasi dealbaui; cui quamuis Poetae illud occini fortassis potest,

Non tu plus cernis, sed plus temerarius audes: Nec tibi plus cordis, sed minus
oris inest.

Nihil tamen hoc deterritus, vtrumque quadrantem meum in Ecclesiae
Gazophilarium conieci: quo animo Deus vnus nouit, nec igitur homo praeiudicet.
Tubicinis ego parts egi, qui impar ipse congressui, animos vestros excitare ad
pugnam, atque accendere volui. Quod autem ad huius mei instituti rationem
attinet, sic breui habete. Rations has Doctorem Barlowum intelligo
Archidiaconum Wintoniensem, quem etiam honoris causa nomino.
universe primum a me informatas, doctissimi viri, eiusdemque mei amantissimi
rogatus mihi expressit: quas cum illi probarentur (qua est iudicij maturitate)
vt particulatim deinde, and sigillatim confirmarem, eiusdem hortatu adductus
sum. Quo est effectum, vt in hanc, quam videtis, molem excreuerint. Quas cum a
partu suffocare potius in animo haberem, quam in lucem edere, pervitit aliorum
iudicium, and authoritas, vt evulgarem, praelogi committerem. Quorum quidem
voluntati ^o id libentius annui and concessi; partim quod nonnullam in spem
veni, nonnihil ad Ecclesiam vtilitatis hinc esse peruenturum, cum quam
infirmis, quamque arenosis Romanae religionis structura (quam solam falso
Catholicam iactitant) nixa sit fundamentis, omnes, quivelint, vno quasi intuitu
perspiciant: partim autem vt resciscant Pontificij, qui eruditionis, Bozius,
lib. 12. de sig. Eccles. cap 12. Posse^. lib. 1. Biblioth.
and doctrinae existimationem omnem Iesuitis suis arrogant, nobis derogant (sic
enim Thrasones illi vbique baubantur and deblaterant) non deesse Ecclesiae
nostrae Ministros suos, qui eorum errores liquido redarguere and possunt, and
vero audent: cum infimus poene ex nostris vnus comminus cum ijs manus
conserere, and in arenam prouocare non reformidat: vnde quid gregum ductores
efficere possunt, si annitantur, par est illos reputare: partim etiam quod
Pontificiorum suae persuadendo religioni quamplurimos strenuam operam nauasse
video: Euangelicorum autem, qui hoc idem scriptionis genus per certa
argumentorum motuumve capita sunt sequuti, paucissimos sane recordor, ne dicam
nulios. Vestram igitur in tutelam (fratres) meas hasce ratiunculas accipite,
aequis animis, atque oculis legite, and discutite. Censuram vestram non recuso,
dum preces modo vestras, and amorem mihi non denegetis. Hic Romanae religionis
septem sacramenta: Turpitudinem, Impietatem, Falsitatem, Nouitatem,
Idololatriam, Scripturarum vituperationem, and Ignorantiae defensionem, licet
contueri: de quibus princeps Impuritas sequentium in rationum prima and
secunda; in tertia autem, quarta and duodecima Impietas aperietur: Nouitas,
quam nobis obiectant, in eos ipsos totam per vndecimam regeretur: Falsitas in
octaua and nona dilucebit: Idolorum cultus in septima: Scripturarum contemptio,
simul and Ignorantiae defensio in quinta, sexta, and decima patefient. Frement
and frendebunt (sat scio) Iesuitae, caeterique sacrificuli, ac omissis forte
rationum ipsarum ponderibus, and momentis, hinc atque illinc (vt eorum moris
est) aliquidpiam excerpent, quod obtrectent, and arrodant: sed ringantur per me
quidem, and rumpantur invidia: nihili illorum sieve calumnias moror, sieve
maledicta, dum vos modo propitios mihi habeam, quorum inprimis vereor, and
reuereor iudicium. Quos propterea oro and obtestor, vt siqua in re de veritatis
scopo deflexerim, comiter in viam me reducatis: si minus ac debui fortiter and
prudenter hac in arena demicarim, imbecillitati id meae condonetis,
praeuaricationi nequaquam tribuatis. Ego certe hoc, quantillumcunque est, Deo
nostro minime displiciturum confido, quippe non ignarus, seruulum qui duobus
extalentis rem fecit, Domino suo, aeque ac illum alterum, acceptum, probatumque
extitisse, qui december ex quinque lucrifecit. Interim (fratres) mutui amoris
vinculo nos inter nos complectamur: vt quemadmodum contra sponsam Christi
aduersarij nostri (vt olim Pilatus and Herodes contra Christum ipsum)
coniunctissime conspirant and consentiunt: Sic nos pari voluntatum consensu,
eademque aut etiam maiore animorum conspiratione, aduersus Antichristum,
illiusque astipulatorum and ^ssectatorum omnium vires depugnemus. Quod eo vt
fortius, foeliciusque fiat, facessant a nobis, precor, derebus minutulis lites
omnes, and discordiae, quibus nimio plus iam diu assueuimus: Reprimamus nunc
demum ipsinos, ne quam, de sui temporis quibusdam, Iraeneus habuit querimoniam,
Iraen. cont. haeres. lib. 4. c. 62.
quod proptermodicas and quaslibet causas, magnum and gloriosum Christi corpus
conscinderent: quam etiam de suae aetatis consimilibus alijs Nazianzenus:
Nazian. Apol. page 28.
quod essent (...) eadem de nobis ni prouidemus iusta querela esse possit. Quin
Apostoli illud ad Corinthios de re exgenere indifferentium disserentis potius
meminerimus. Siquis videtur 1. Cor. 2. 16.
contentiosus esse, nos eiusmodi consuetudinem non habemus, neque Ecclesia Dei:
and eiusdem aliud ad Galatas, Si alij alios mordetis and deuoratis, Gal. 5. 15.
videte ne vicissim alij ab alijs consumamini. Deus pacis and lucis ab
Antichristi illiusque gregalium impetu, and insidijs vos omnes protegat, and
defendat, ac coelestem suam ad ciuitatem, nouam Hierosolymam sartos tectos
tandem perducat.

T. B*

Motive I. THat Religion which in many points gives liberty to sin, is not
the truth: but such is the Religion of the Church of Rome: ergo, etc. Motive
II. That Religion, which maintaynes by the grounds thereof things forbidden, by
all laws both of God, of Nature, and of Man, cannot be the true Religion: bat
such is the Religion of the Roman Church: ergo. Motive III. That Religion
which imitateth the Jews in those things wherein there are enemies to Christ,
cannot be the truth: but such is the Religion of the Church of Rome: Ergo.
Motive IIII. That Religion which derog^teth from the glory of God in the work
of our Redemption, and gives part thereof unto man, cannot be the truth of
God: but such is the Popish Religion: ergo. Motive V. That Religion deserves
to be suspected, which refuses to be t^y^d by the Scriptures, as the perfect
and alone rule of faith, and will be judged and ^ryed by none but it self: But
such is the Religion of the Church of Rome: ergo. Motive VI. That Religion does
justly deserve to be suspected, which does pur^o^^ly disgrace the sacred
Scri^tures: But such is the Religion of the Church of Rome: ^^go. and. Motive
VII. That Religion is to be abhorred, which maintayneth, commands, and
practices gross an^ palpable Idolatry; but so does the Religion of the Church
of Rome: ^rgo, etc. Motive VIII. That Religion which implies manifold
contradiction in it self, and is contrary to it self in many things, cannot
be the true Religion: but such is the Religion of the Church of Rome: ergo,
etc. Motive IX. That Religion, whose doctrines are in many points apparently
opposite to the word of God, and the doctrine of the Gospel, cannot be the
truth: but such is the Religion of the Church of Rome: ergo, etc. Motive X.
That Religion which nourishes most barbarous and gross ignorance amongst the
people, and forbids the knowledge and understanding of the grounds of the
Christian says, cannot be the truth: but this does the Romish Religion: ergo,
etc. Motive XI. That Religion which was never known nor heard of in the
Apostles time, nor in the primitive Church, cannot ^e the truth: but such is
the Romish Religion in most points thereof: therefore that cannot be the truth.
Motive XII. That Church which maintayneth it self, and the Religion professed
by it, and seeks to d^saduantage the Adversaries by unlawful, unjust, and
ungodly means, cannot be the true Church of God, nor that Religion the truth
of God, by the grounds whereof they are warranted to act such deuillish
practices: but such is the practice of the Romish Church, and therefore neither
their Church, nor their Religion can be of God. Motive XIII. That Religion, the
doctrines whereof are more safe both in respect Gods glory, Man's salvation, and
Christian charity, is to be preferred before that which is not so safe, but
dangerous: But the doctrine of the Protestants Religion is more safe in all
those respects, and of the Papists more dangerous: ergo, that is to be
preferred before this, and consequently this to be rejected.
THIRTEEN FORCIBLE MOTIVES, DISSUADING FROM COMMUNION With the Church of ROME.
Whereby is demonstratiuely proved, that the now Romish Religion (so far
forth as it is Romish) is not the true Catholic Religion of CHRIST, but the
seduction of Antichrist.

THE PREAMBLE.
THat which Ireneus (an ancient I. Iraeneus lib. ^ cap. 54.
and godly Father of the Church) speaks of all Heretics, that all the
Helleborus in the world is not sufficient to purge them, that they may vomit
out their folly, may truly be spoken of the Church of Rome, and her
adherents, that it is a difficult matter, if not almost impossible, to reclaim
her from her errors, and to heal her wounds. All the balm of Gilead will not
do it, nor all the spiritual physic that can be ministered; for there are two
sins which of all other are most hard to be relinquished, Whoredom, and
Drunkenness: the one, because it is so familiar and natural to the flesh: the
other, because it breeds by custom such an unquenchable thirst in the
stomach, as must ever anon be watered: with both which spiritual diseases,
the Church of ROME is infected. She is the Whore of Babylon, with whom the
Kings of the Earth have committed fornication, and who has made drunk with
the Wine of her fornications Revel. 17. 12.
all the Inhabitants of the Earth. In regard of the first, Jeremy prophesied
of her, that though pains be taken Ierem. 51. 9.
to heal her, yet she could not be healed. And in regard of the second, Saint
Paul prophesied, that GOD would send 2. These. 2. 10. 11
them strong delusion, that they should believe lies, that all they might be
damned that received not the love of the truth. Notwithstanding, though the
hope be as little of the reclaiming of most of them, as of turning an Eunuch
into a man, or making a black Moore white; yet I have propounded in this
discourse a strong potion compounded of ingredients; which if they be not past
cure, may purge and cleanse them of their disease, and reduce them to the
sanity of Christian Religion. Which if their queasie stomachs shall either
refuse to take, or having taken, shall vomit up again, and not suffer them to
work upon their consciences: yet this benefit will arise, that God shall be
glorified, the truth manifested, and all that love the truth confirmed: and
they also themselves, that are so drowned in error, that they will rather pull
in others over head and ears unto them, and so drown together, then be drawn
out of the mire by any help, shall be convinced in their consciences of their
most gross apostacy. With this confidence toward Gods glory, and the good
of his Church, though with little hope of recovering them from their obdurate
blindness; I enter into my intended task, desiring the Lord to give a
blessing to these poor labors, which I consecrate to my Lord and Master Jesus
Christ, whom I serve, and the Church his Spouse, of which I profess my self
to be one of the meanest members.

MOTIVE. I. That Religion which in many points gives liberty to sin, is not
the truth: but such is the Religion of the Church of ROME: ergo, etc.
THe first proposition is an undoubted truth, and 2. MAYOR* James 1. 27.
needs no confirmation, especially, seeing S. James describes true Religion by
these attributes, pure and undefiled: And S. Paul 2. Tim. 3. 1. Tit. 1. 1.
calls it the mystery of godliness, and the doctrine according to
godliness. And herein consists an essential difference betwixt the true
Religion and all false ones; so that it must needs follow, that, that Religion
which is essentially the cause and occasion of sin, and opens a wide window
to ungodliness, cannot be the truth of God, but must needs fetch it beginning
from the devil, who is the author of all evil. The Gospel indeed may by
accident Romans 7. 11. Matt. 10. 34.
be the occasion of evil, as S. Paul says, The law is the occasion of sin,
for it stirs up contention and strife, and discouers the corruptions of Man's
heart, and by opposing against them (as a damme against a stream) makes them
to swell and boil, and burst forth beyond the bounds: howbeit, here the cause
is not in the Gospel, or Law; but in the corruption of man's heart, which, the
more it is stirred, the more it rages and strives to show it self. But never
yet was the doctrine of godliness the cause of wickedness, nor the pure and
undefiled Religion of Christ Jesus, an essential procurer and prouoker unto
sin.

3. This therefore being thus manifest, all the question and difficulty
remains in the second proposition; to wit, that the Religion of the Romish
Church is such as opens a gappe unto sin, and gives notorious liberty and
scope to ungodliness; and that not by way of accident or occasion, but
necessarily as the cause to the effect, Qua data, necessario soquitur effectus;
as the Logicians speak: and therefore being an ^npure and defiled Religion,
and the mystery of iniquity, not the mystery of godliness: it cannot be
that true Religion which Christ our Savior brought with him from heaven, and
left here upon earth blameless and unspotted like himself, to be the way to
lead us unto heaven, where he is.

4. That the Romish Religion is a polluted and defiled Religion, MINOR.
tending to liberty and looseness. Let the indifferent Reader judge by these
few instances, derived out of the very bowels of their Church, and being
articles of their faith, and grounds of their Religion. And first to begin
with their I. Med. Christ. paraen. li. 7. ca. 17. Gratian part. 1. page 76.
Panorm. extr. de diuort. c. fin. Felyn. de consist. cap. statut. can. 1. Anton.
pa^. 3. tit. 22. cap. 6.
doctrine of dispensations; whereby they teach that the Pope has power to
dispense with the word of God, and with every commandment of the Law, and not
only with the Law, but with the Gospel and Epistles of Paul: to what horrible
looseness and lewdness of life does it tend? for to omit that it contains
in it open blasphemy by their own rule, which is, that In praecepto
superioris non debet dispensare inferior, the inferior may not dispense with
the precept of the superior, by which the Pope dispensing with Gods law, is
not one^y equalled, but exalted above God; what sin is there, be it never so
heinous, which there is not liberty given to commit by this licencious
doctrine?

5. Incest? But Pope Martin the first gave a dispensation to one to marry his
own sister, and not his wives sister only, as some of the Romish crew would
dawbe over this filthy wall, because it is in Antoninus, Cum quadam eius
germana: Antonin. part. Siluest. in verbo Papa. page 279. Bartho. fumus in
verb. dispensat. Angel. de Claua. in verbo. papa.
for Siluester Prieri^, Bartholomeus Fumus, and Angelus de Clauafio, speak
more plainly, Cumsua germana; that is, with his own natural sister. Another
Pope dispensed with Henry the eight to marry his sister in law: and with
Philip of Spain to marry his own Niece: and Clement the 7. licenced Petrus
Aluaradus the Spaniard, to marry two sisters at once: and Fumus quo supra
Caietan, in Leui. cap. 18. Nauarr. enchir. page 515.
no marvel, seeing it is the very doctrine of the Romish Church, that the
Pope can dispense in all the degrees of Consanguinitie and Affinity, save
only with the Father and his daughter, and with the Mother and her Son.
Sodometrie? But Pope Sixtus the fourth licensed the Cardinal of Saint Lucie,
and his family, to use freely that sin, not to be named in the three hot
months of the year. And Johannes a Casa Archbishop of Beneuentum, and Legate
to Pope Julius the third, set forth a Book in Italian Meeter, in commendation
of this execrable sin.

6. Adultery, and fornication? But they affirm and hold, Nauarr. Enchir, page
515. Caietan in Leu. cap. 18.
that the Pope has power to dispense with all manner of persons in the
contract of Matrimony, (the Father with his daughter, and the mother with her
Son) only excepted. And therefore Vladislaus King of Hungary, and Ludouicus
Rob. Gag. in Lud^uic. 12.
the French King, by means of dispensation purchased from the Pope, put away
their lawful wives, and married others. And for Fornication, the Popes Canon
is famous, He that Mich. Ritus l. 2. Decret. did. 34. cap. 4.
has not a wife, but for a wife, or instead of a wife, a Concubine, let him
not for that be kept from the Communion. And Bellarmines doctrine confirms
the same Canon of the Pope, and ^el. de monach. li. 2. ca. 30.
crosses the Canon of Christ; for thus he writes, that speech of the Apostle
(they that cannot contain, let them marry, for it is better to marry then to
burn) cannot be rightly said of them that have vowed, for both are naught,
both to burn and to marry; yea, it is worse of the two to marry, whatsoever
the Protestants say to the contrary. This is the 75. Grauamen complained Cent.
Grauam. grau. 75.
of by the Germans, that the Bishops and their Officials did tolerate Priests
to have Concubines, under the payment of a certain annual rent of money.
Which also Espens^^s a learned Espens. de conti. li. 2. cap. 7. and in Tit. 1.
Bishop of their own confesses, and complayneth of both in his second Book
de Continentia, and in his Commentary upon Titus. Nay, that which is horrible
to speak, and almost incredible to believe, the Germans in their 91. Grauamen
complained, that not only those Priests that had their whores, paid yearly
rent for it, but even those that were continent and would have no Conenbines,
must pay the rent; and then be it at their choice whether they would have a
Concubine or no. And lest any should think that Priests only were thus
dispensed withal, and that their Concubines were in stead of wives, though for
the avoiding of scandal they might not have that name: as if the name of a
wife were more scandalous then the name of a Concubine (O height of impiety!)
let all the world know, that not only the Clergy, but also the Laity were in
this case dispensed withal, as might be proved by many examples, if need
were. May not this Church than rightly be s^led The Whore of Babylon, which
thus authoriseth whoredom in all degrees, and turns a filthy sin into a
lawful and warrantable act?

7. Perjury? But it is a proverb in the Popes Court, (as Pet. Martyr loc. com.
testifies Peter Martyr) Quod non est Regum and Magistratuum, sed Mercatorum
stare iuramentis; It is not the part of Kings and Magistrates, but of
Merchants, to stand to their oaths: And this is one of their renowned
positions, The Pope may dispense with any oath, be it never so lawful. Upon
which ground Azorius the Jesuit defends Pope Gregory Azor. Inst^tut. mor.
l. l. 5. c. 15.
the twelfth, who in the time of a great schism did openly and solemnly
swear, that if he were made Pope, he would give it over again: but being
elected, he performed nothing less. And also the same Jesuit avouches, that
other men's oaths Idem li 11. c. 9.
may be dissolved by the Pope. And the gloss upon the Decretals Glossa ad
Decret. li. 2. tit. 24. cap. 10.
says, That a man is no further bound to the observation of any oath, then it
shall like the Pope. And the reason is added, Quia in omni iurament o excipitur
authoritas maioris, in every oath the authority of a superior must be
excepted; which superior by their doctrine is the Pope. And for their practice
herein, I appeal to Cardinal Julian the Popes Legate Bonfin. Decad. 3. lib. 6.
in Hungary, who not only licenced, but persuaded Vladislaus the King to
break the league, and falsify his oath made Aeneas Siluius com. in Europ.
to Amurath the Turk, which was the cause not only of his overthrow, but of
the loss of a great part of that famous Kingdom; behold the fruits of these
Roman Prophets. And to leap from a Cardinal to a Pope, I call to witness
Clement the 7. who dispensed with Francis the French King, for his oath sworn
to Charles the fifth, at his delivery out of prison. And lest any should think
this to be a particular blot of one Pope; add to him Gregory the 7. who
released Rodolph the King of Sue^ia from his oath of obedience to the Emperor
Henry the 4. and conferred the Empire upon him. And Pope Zachary, Boniface the
eight, and Benedict de la lune, who freed the French men from their oath of
obedience, which they ought unto their Kings. And lastly, Pius Quintus, who by
his Bull of excommunication against our late famous Queen of blessed memory,
discharged her subjects from their oath of allegiance, whereby many open
rebellions were raised up against the State, and secret treas^ns plotted
against her sacred person.

8. Disobedience to Parents, Rebellion against lawful Princes, and murdering
of them also if they stand in their way? Bell. de monach. lib. 2. cap. 36.
but the Pope can dispense with children, if they shall take upon them the vow
of single life, after fourteen years of age, and enter into a Sodomiticall
Cloister: and the Father has nothing to do with his child being there once
encloistered except he cannot live without his help. And for Princes; I* ^uita
Gicar.
if the Pope shall excommunicate a Prince, or suborne a wicked traitor to
murder his Sovereign, then is this rebellion and murder not only a
warrantable, but also a meritorious and an heroical act. Witness at home the
Irish rebellion, heartened forward by Doctor Saunders, by the Popes
instigation: and abroad, the murder of Henry the third, the French King, by
James Clement; which bloody deed was after highly commended by the Pope in his
consistoriall Oration to be seen in print. And of Henry the fourth, of late
days by hellish Rauilliac, with many such like, which I could here produce,
but that fitter occasion will be offered hereafter for their larger discovery.

9. These few particulars are sufficient to show, what a gap is laid open to
all loosnes by this Romish doctrine of dispensations; which, that it is not our
malicious collection (as they affirm) but a necessary consequence: One of
their own Francis^. V^ct. d potest. pap. and council. Relect. ^. page 139.
learned Friars confesses as much, Vid^m^^ quotidie a Romana curia, etc. We
see daily (says he) so large, yea so dissolute dispensations come from the
Court of ROME, that the world is not able to endure them; neither do they tend
only to the scandal of the weak, but of those also that are strong. I omit
here the Popes dispensing with the cure of souls; whereby he plainly
declares, that though he proudly styles himself supremus pastor animarum,
the chief shepherd of souls: yet he is maximus vastator animarum, the
greatest hauocker of souls that is on the earth (the Devil only excepted)
who goes beyond him a little, I must needs confess: for when he licenceth
some of his Cardinals to enjoy some 200. some Nichol. Clenang.

were served, or starued: what does he Ioh. Gers. tom. ^. de potest Eccles.
consid. 10.
but show himself rather a Wolf, than a Shepherd? This kind of dispensation
Saint Bernard in his time calls a dissipation. And John Picas the famous
Earl of M^randula, in an Ioh. Pic. Miran. ^rat. ad Leon. 10
Oration to Pope Leo the 10. complains of, as a notorious corruption in the
Church in his days. Now then, to conclude the point, if to maintain Incest,
Sodometry, adultery, fornication, perjury, disobedience to Parents, rebellion
against Princes, and murder, be not to give license to most horrible and foul
sins, let all men judge, and then consider what that Religion is to be judged
of, which gives either open or secret dispensation to all these.

10. This is the first Romish doctrine directly tending to 2.
liberty: A second, nothing inferior to the former, is their doctrine of
popish pardons and Indulgences: a doctrine indeed full of all licentiousnes,
stuffed with impiety, and letting the reins loose to all manner of villainy. For
thus they teach, that the Pope being Christ's Vicar here on earth, has the
keys of the kingdom of Heaven in custody, to admit in by Indulgence, or to
shut out by excommunication as he shall see cause: and that the merits of
Martyrs (to wit) their works Bell. de Indulgen. lib. 1. ca. 2.
of supererogation, which they have more then they need for their own
salvation, which (mixed with the merits of Christ) they call the treasure of
the Church, are to be dispensed and disposed at his pleasure.

11. The limits and largenes of these pardons they stretch Aquin. supl. in 3.
par. q. 25. art. ^. Bonif. apud Plat. in vita.
so far, that they make them of more force then the death and passion of
Christ: for as they teach, Christ's death freeth only a culpa and aterna poena,
that is, from the guilt of the fault and the eternal punishment due unto it,
but not a poena temporali, from the temporal punishment: but these popish
pardons acquit and discharge both from the guilt, and from the punishment
temporal and eternal, as some of them affirm, and they that mince it finest,
from the guilt and temporal punishment: so that Christ's passion comes short
of his Vicars Veg. li. 13. c. 36.
pardon, and the servant can do more then the Master by their Religion: for
though the efficacy of these pardons depends upon the merits of Christ; yet
that is but in part, Tapper. expl. art. Louan. art. 6.
for the Saints merits must be mixed with them, or else they alone make no good
medicine, and the Pope must dispense them, or else they are of no value.
Neither do they firetch only to those that are alive, but to the dead also:
And that Fu^men. brut. ex bull. Clem. 6.
not only in Purgatory, but in Hell. Out of both which places (say they) both
the suburbs and the City, the Pope is able to deliver whom he pleases, and
place them in heaven, the seat of the blessed: this is the opinion of diverse
of them. Antoninus the Archbishop of Florence avouches almost as Antonin.
part. 3. Tit. 22. c. 5.. 6.
much (leaving out hell) for he says that the Pope, in respect of his absolute
jurisdiction, may absolve all that are in Purgatory, and empty the prison at
once: (mark his reasons) for (says he) seeing Gregory by his prayer
discharged Traiane from the pain of hell, which is infinite: Therefore much
more may the Pope by communication of indulgences, absolve all that are in
Purgatory, from that punishment which is but finite. And for as much as Christ
may take away all pain, therefore the Pope also (who is his Vicar) may. These
be the Archbishops goodly reasons, the one whereof is mere foolish and
frivolous, the other blasphemous: but howsoever it be, yet thousands of
ignorant persons have received these as their Creed, and by them been seduced
to the utter ruin and destruction of their souls.

12. And to that height of impudency are these pardonmongers Onuph. Pa^vi^.
grown, that they stock not to promise plenary remission of all sins, to
all that either come on pilgrimage to Rome, or miscarry in their journey, or
that visit the holy places there, especially the 7. privileged Churches;
promising to some 50. to some a 100. to some 3000. years of pardon. Yea,
Boniface the eight granted, of his bountiful liberality, 82000. years pardon,
for every time saying a prayer of S. Augustine, printed in a Table at Venice,
and that toties quoties. John the 22. granted twenty years pardon to every one
that does but bow his head at the naming of Jesus. Here is a notable pardon
indeed: a man may in one day provide for millions of ages, and not only for
himself, but to help his friends out of Purgatory. Besides all this, their
holy Father the Pope uses to consecrate and hallow an infinite number of
Crucifixes, and Medailes, and Agnus Dei's, Holy grains or Beads, and such like
trash, and send them abroad into the world, that whosoever wears one of them
about him, if he be at the point of death, and say but in his heart the name
Jesus, shall have a plenary and full forgiveness of all his sins.

13. But what should I rake any deeper into this filthy puddle? I might spend
much time and travail in deciphering the infinite and gross absurdities of
this monstrous doctrine, Recitare, est refutare.
the very naming whereof is a sufficient confutation. I refer the Reader to
others that have amply discovered these secrets of the whore of Babylon. But to
return to the point, Is not this a doctrine (I pray you) of licentiousness?
who would fear to sin, when pardon may be obtained at so low a rate? for
bowing the head, saying over a short prayer, visiting a Church, creeping to a
Cross, wearing a Crucifixe, pardon may be purchased for sins, without
number, and that for years without number. What is the height of liberty, if
this be not? But yet they ascend higher, for there is a great Mart of all these
Indulgences at Rome, there you may have them at a very low price, rather then
go without, yea, cheaper than any other ware: and lest Rome should seem too
far to fetch them thence, there are petty markets and faires of them in every
Country, and the Pedlers that carry about this trash, are the Priests and
Jesuits. Leo the tenth sent T^^elius ^alaeus in vita Leonis 10.
about with his Pardons, offering to every one for the payment of ten
shillings, and not a penny under, to set at liberty the soul of any one which
they should name in Purgatory. And of late it is said, that the Jesuits
brought into England, Agnus Dei's by thousands, which they sold at what rate
they list to poor seduced Papists. Peroun the French Cardinal brought with
him from Rome many such hallowed and holy things, as some say, by the sale
thereof to help to defray his charges which he was at in that costly journey.

14. What should I name unto you their odious merchandise, and setting to sale
of all manner of sin, called taxa poenitentiaria Apostolica, whereby impunity
is granted to every sin, be it never so grievous; so the party pays
according to the rate for his absolution, to wit, if he will be absolved from
adultery or incest, it must cost him four Turons: if from both together it
must stand him in six Turons: if from wilful murder (being in holy orders)
he must pay twelve Turons: being a Bishop or an Abbot fifty Turons, twelve
Muscul. com. loc. tit. minist.
Ducats? etc. Thus there is no sin so heinous, for which pardon may not be
purchased for a small sum of money, as one of their own Canonists could
sing, Johan. Monachu^


Si dederis marcas, and ijs impleueris arcas,
Culpa solueris, quaque ligatus eris.
If thou with marks, wilt fill their arkes,
what ere thou do commit
By word or deed, thou shall be freed,
the Pope has pardoned it.
15. If this be not a doctrine of liberty, let all the world judge. Who need
care what sin he commit, when a pardon is but a money matter? Is it any
marvel now, if whores and thieves and notorious offenders turn Papists,
seeing they may have so easily a full and plenary remission of all their
offenses? And that which is yet a greater emboldening of men to sin then all
the rest; they oftentimes for money pardon a sin before it be committed, as
it is constantly reported of Parry, that he brought with him his pardon in his
pocket for murdering the late Queen, intended by him. But I have heard of some
that have been hanged with their pardons about their necks, and so (it may be)
was that bloudyminded Traitor. And this was it that emboldened the Germans
Chemnit. exam. de poeniteat.
to rob the Popes pardoner, because they had purchased of him before, a
pardon for the next sin they should commit, though it were a great one: now
this was the next, and therefore justly he could not find fault with them.

16 By this it is evident, to what looseness and lewdness of life this
doctrine does tend. Isti enim indulgentiarum buccinatores, Onus Eccles. ca. 15.
fol. 26.
omnimodam promit^unt securitatem, quaeparit negligentiam and negligentia
offensam Dei, says the Author of that Book called Onus Ecclesiae; that is,
these publishers of pardons do promise all manner of security, which breeds
negligence, and negligence the offense of God: for Culpam qui praeterit,
inuitat nouam, conniuence at one fault is the hatching of a new. Who so will
plainly see in one view the monstrous licentiousness of life that issues from
this puddle of Popish pardons, let him read the third grieuance of the German
Nation, in the Book of their Centum grauamina, exhibited to the Popes Legate
at Noremberge, Anno 1522. in the latter end whereof are these words of just
complaint. By the sale and merchandise of this ware, not only Germany is
spoiled of money, but Christian godliness is extinguished, where, when every
one, according to the quantity of his payment, takes unto himself liberty to
sin: hence whoredom, incest adultery, perjury, murder, theft, robbery,
usury, and a whole heap of mischiefs have proceeded; for, what mischief will
men be afraid to commit, when they be once persuaded that they have obtained
license and impunitie to sin, not only in this life, but also after their
death? Hitherto is the complaint of Germany, which also may be the just
complaint of the whole world.

17 A third doctrine of the Papists (opening the gap to licentiousnes) 3.
is their auricular confession, and popish penance: I join them together,
because they go together in their practice, and are both together members of
one of their new devised Sacraments. True it is, that in outward show these
carry a semblance of severe discipline: but if we search into their bowels, we
shall find them to be the greatest baytes that can be unto dissoluteness: For
when they teach that the enumeration and reckoning up of all a man's finnes in
the year, of a Priest, once a year, obtains present absolution and pardon
at the Priests hands, who is both Judge in this cause, and Physician; and has
power to loofe and bind, and to open and shut, to wound and heal, by the key
of power Coster. enchir.
committed to him: What is this, but to open a gappe to all wickedness? for when
men are persuaded that there is so ready and easy a means to be rid of their
sin, what need they be so chary of committing it? Hence it is (as by
lamentable experience it is found true) among those that are devoted to this
Religion, they sin freely, that they may confess and be absolved; and when
they have confessed they sin again, that they may confess again, making no
conscience how they live all the year, and what horrible sins they commit,
being persuaded that at Easter, by the shriuing of a Priest, they are clean
absolved. Just like a drunkard, that drinks so long till he vomit, and when
his stomach is disgorged, drinks afresh, that he may vomit afresh: or like a
glutton, that surfets all the year long in all manner of intemperancy, and then
in the spring takes physic to purge out the naughty humors from his stomach,
and as soon as he is purged, falls again to his surfeting and riot, in hope to
be purged again in the spring.

18. This is the fruit of Popish shrift, commended so highly by them to be so
sovereign a medicine against sin; which, if it be so, why did not Christ and
his Apostles use it? were they not as careful to preserve men from sin, as
the Pope and his shauelings are? or is the Pope and his Apostles wiser then
Christ Jesus and his Disciples? why was it not used in the Primitive and purer
times of the Church? Rhenanus and Erasmus, Rhen. Annot. ad Tertul. de poenit.
Eras. Annot. ad Hieron. de obitu Sabi^l. Chrysostom. Homil. 22. ad popul. Antioch.
two learned Papists, affirm plainly, that it was neither ordained by Christ,
nor used by the ancient Church: and Chrysostom tells us, that God does not
enforce us to come forth and disclose our sins to any man. He requires no
more (says he) but that we speak to him alone, and to him alone confess our
faults. I, but the Popes judgment is more divine, and the times of Popery are
more free from corruption (believe it who list) and therefore howsoever then,
yet now it is found to be a sovereign preservative against sin: as if they
that fear not to offend in the presence of God, will blush to confess their
offenses in the ear of a sinful Priest: or as if the law of God were of
less force to keep men in awe, which they cannot escape, than the fear of a
mortal man, whom they may deceive.

19. But let them say what they will, and cloak their licentiousness with
never so holy pretenses, all that have any judgment to discern colors,
which the blind Romanists cannot do, or any wisdom to try the spirits and
doctrines whether they be of God or no; know, that Romish shrift is nothing but
a shift to diue into men's purses, and a trick of policy to search into their
purposes, that by that means they may enrich their own coffers, and uphold
their Antichristian Hierarchy: for by this device they understand the secrets
of state, and ciscouer men's affections in Religion, and so cunningly insinuate
themselves into the managing of all affairs, both for prevention of prejudice
to themselves, and undermining their opposites: this is the policy of Romish
shrift; and were this all, it were to be borne withal, if withal it did not
open a wide door of liberty to others, as I have in part showed; and were not
a bawd of uncleanness to the shriuers themselves. Hear what one of their own
writers reuealeth concerning this last point. It is an ordinary practice (says
he) Aluar. pelag. and Planet. eccl. lia. art. 27.
for Priests to commit execrable villainy with women at shrift, rauishing wives,
and deflowring maids in the Church, and committing Sodomie with young men, etc.
Cornelius Agrippa, another of their own, has left in writing for all
posterity to remember, that Auricular confession is genus quoddam lenocinij,
and he De vanit. c. 64.
refers us for proof thereof unto the Tripartite History: Nec desunt mihi
(says he) si refer velim cognita recentia exempla. I need not to seek for
far examples: for I could relate many fresh and well known, if I would. And
then he concludes, that Priests and Friars, and Monks, having, under pretense
of Religion, free access unto any woman many times, whose souls they should
gain to God, their bodies they sacrifice to the devil. Thus is their own
filth cast in their faces by their own favorites, who by all likelihood would
speak the best of their mother, and in no respect durst slander her, for fear
of shame and punishment. We find in the Tripartite History (to the which it
may be Agrippa had relation) of the rape of a noble woman by a Deacon in the
time of shrift; for the which cause Nectarius the Bishop of Constantinople,
banished this secret confession out of his Church; as also, all the Bishops of
the East did the like in theirs. This story is recorded by Socrates, Socrat.
li. 5. ca. 9. Sozom. li. 7. c. 16. Tripart. l. 9. c. 35 Niceph. l. 12. c. 28
Andr. ort^o. exp. Baro. tom. 1. art. 56. ^u. 28. Cost. ench. p. 387.
Sozomene, and Nicephorus; neither is it denied by the Romanists themselves,
though some of them condemn Nectarius for doing so: As Andradius and Baronius,
the one calling it a most impudent fact: the other saying, that not a good
spirit; but an evil spirit persuaded him there unto. And others seek to elude
ti, by saying the story is mistaken, and that Nectarius banished not confession
it self, but the necessity of confessing to one certain Priest, which though
it be a vain gloss which corrupts the text, as Chemnitius fully proves:
yet, not Chem. exam. Tri. de confess.
to stand upon it, this is evident, that such a foul fact was committed in the
time of shrift, and that thereupon this secret confession was either utterly
abrogated, or at least so restrained, that it was no more secret, for fear of
such like enormities: and indeed grant that Nectarius did evil in abolishing
all kind of confession, as Socrates, and Sozomene charge him: and as we also
will not excuse him, for we hold that there may be an holy and profitable use
of confession in the Church, for the searching of the wounds of sinful
souls, and applying of fit counsel and comfort to distressed consciences; yet
from thence we may derive these three conclusions, first, that secret shrift
was then thought not to be ex iure diuino, but only a tradition of the
Church, for else it could not have been abolished; secondly, that it was not
thought necessary for the remission of sins, as the Romanists teach; and
thirdly, that it is a most dangerous occasion to uncleanness, which is the
matter we have in hand to prove.

20. If any here except, that these enormities proceed from the abuse, and not
from the use of shrift, and that they be personal frailties, and not
corruptions of doctrine. I answer; first, that the very use thereof is so
dangerous, especially to these rank Votaries, that it is ten to one but it
ever degenerates into the abuse: for, wanting the lawful remedy ordained by
God, no marvel if their lusts break forth into lawless actions. Again,
what warrant can there be of Gods Panormitan. Peresi. Petrus Oxoni^n.
blessing to sanctify the use of that, which is not an ordinance of God, but a
mere humane invention, as diverse of their own Doctors have confessed, and is
most easy to be proved? And lastly, though there may be a profitable use of
confession, as I have said; yet this Auricular enumeration and Romish shrift
cannot be lawfully used, because they make the very act thereof meritorious to
salvation, and the absolution of the Priest an actual and real remitting of
sin; which opinion cannot but animate men to the committall of sin, seeing
they have their remedy so ready at hand, to wit, after the uttering a few
words, the mouth of the Priest to absolve them.

21. As for Contrition, which by their doctrine must go before Confession,
that makes the matter never a whit the Roffens. ep. art. 5. Maldon. in Sum. q.
16. art. 1. Suarez. tom. 4. desp. 4. Sect. 4. Tollet. lib. 3. de instruct.
sacr. c. 5
more difficult, neither does it any whit the more bridle from sin: for, if
the grief be but small, yet is the penitent absolved (says our Fisher:) and a
Jesuit, a slender grief is sufficient: and another Jesuit, The least degree
of grief is able to wipe away the highest degree of sin. Surely this kind of
contrition is so far from brideling our corrupt nature from sin, that it
more incites and pricks it forward; for who would fear to sin, if this be
true, that the least grief conceived in heart, together with the discovering
of it to the Priest, and the Priests formal absolution, is sufficient for the
full pardon and remission thereof?

22. But peradventure the last part of this Sacrament binds up the two former
in greater severity: let us consider a little therefore of their penance and
satisfaction. They condemn us lowdly, and rail with open throat against us,
calling us Libertines, and Epicures, for rejecting their penance and
satisfactory pains after sins committed. But, who are the Libertines, they
or us? let any indifferent reader (all prejudice set apart) judge. Are we
Libertines for renouncing their popish penance? why, there is no doctrine that
more notoriously tends to liberty then this: For first, what are those
satisfactory works which they enjoin poor penitents? Coster Cost. enchir. de
p^nit.
a Jesuit reduces them to three heads, Prayer, Alms, and Fasting: to one of
which three, all particulars in that kind may be referred; as to Prayer, they
refer Masses, Dirges, and Trentals, visiting of holy places, pilgrimage, and
such like: to Alms, building of Abbeys, and religious houses, giving to
Couents of Friars and Nuns: as for relieuing of the poor, that is the least
point of their alms: to Fasting, sackcloth, ashes, watching, whipping,
sleeping on the pauement, going barefoote, handy labor, and such like: If the
first sort be imposed, for the most part it is nothing but the shuffling over
of their Beads so many times a day, with so many Creeds, and so many Aues,
though they understand never a word they speak, or the saying of so many
Masses, or going to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas of Canterbury, or of some
other Saint: all which is so far from pinching the soul, or taming the body
for sin, that as by Chaucers Canterbury tales may appear, it deserves
rather to be called a pastime than a penance. If Alms be enjoined by the
Confessor to the poor penitent, then must an Abbey be built, or some religious
house to nourish a company of idle drones, good for nothing but fruges
consumere; or suppose an highway be repaired, or a Church reedified, or an
Hospital erected, what terror can this be from sin, when the penalty may
thus be discharged by the purse? As for their Fasting, watching, whiping, going
barefoote, though it carry a show of zeal in respect of not sparing the body,
yet it is a plain imitation of Baals Priests; and little profitable (as Saint
Paul says) to godliness, but rather Col. 2. 23. 1. Tim. 4. 8.
an incitation to loosenes. For when a man is persuaded and taught, that all
his foul sins (committed the whole year before) are utterly blotted out, and
done away, by fasting one meal every Wednesday and Friday, and eating nothing
but Fish during the holy time of Lent (except Iunckets, and sweet meats, and
wine and Sugar, which they gorge themselves withal, and yet fast too) and
bearing ashes on Ashwednesday, going woolward on Good Friday, or giving
himself half a dozen lashes on the back, or creeping to a cross, and such
like trumpery: I say, when a man is persuaded that this short pain is a
sufficient satisfaction for the punishment of all his former sin, (for so
they teach) who would not return C^ster. ench. de sacram. p^nit. page 400.
again to his vomit of wickedness, seeing the pleasures (which he hopes to
enjoy by his sins) are far longer and greater then the punishment wherewith
he makes satisfaction?

22. Secondly, to show that all this great noise of satisfactions is nothing
but a mere May Game, and mockery; observe Suar. tom. 4. disp. 50. Sect 5.
Cost. d^ Ind. etc. Aquin. S^plan 3. par. q. 25. art 1. Tol t. li. 6. de
instruct sac. ca. 22. and 23.
diligently their own doctrine: Thus they teach, that all satisfactory
punishments may be released by a pardon. Aquinas, their illumined Doctor,
gives this reason thereof, Christ might release the fault without any
satisfaction, and so might Paul, ergo, so may the Pope: and this is one of
their late definitions of a pardon. Indulgentia est remissio harum actionu^
quae sunt a Confessario iniunctae peccatori. It is the remitting of that
penance which is enjoined a sinner by his Confessor. And therefore another
Jesuit truly confesses, that the Indulgences Val. li. de Indul. cap. 2.
have taken away all use of severe discipline out of the Church: have they so,
good Jesuit? Then thus it follows; you let out satisfactions (which you so
much extol) and withal let in great liberty into the Church, not only by
opening the door to pardons, but bewray your own absurdities. For what a
ridiculous jest is this? he that has offended, must do penance after his
confession, or else he cannot be saved, and after his penance is assigned, get
but a pardon, and then there needs no further satisfaction. And how is a
pardon procured? why, for a little piece of money, omnia venalia Romae. The
Pope has his pardon. Pedlers in all Countries, thou need not go far for
it, they will bring it home to thy doors, at least, if thou be sat, and able
to greaze them well. Pope Boniface the ninth sent out his Bulls into diverse
Countries, releasing (...). de (...). li. 1. ^a. 68.
for a certain sum of money all offenses whatsoever, without any penance.
And Leo the tenth offered to free for ten shillings Bal. in vita Le^nis 10.
any soul you would name, out of Purgatory; much more a man's own soul, that
it should never come thither: here is a doctrine indeed of severity, if any
was among the Epicures: who will not say but this is a Censorious and strict
Religion?

23. I, but some will say peradventure, oh, it is an hard matter to pay ten
shillings for a pardon, this is the penance of the purse, which to a covetous
rich man, or to a miserable poor man, is worse the^ the penance of the
carkeis. Why, but thou may have it cheaper if thou will, and therefore indeed
he is a fool which will part with a penny for the purchase of Nich. Sali.

a pardon: say but devoutly a little short prayer in the Primer, and thou shall
have three thousand days pardon of mortal sins, and twenty thousand days
of venial, given by Vide White page 255.
Pope ^ohn the twenty two. And if that Prayer be too long, say five
Pater-nosters before the Vernacle, and thou shall have ten thousand days

days: or if thou dwell near Rome, do but visit the Church of Saint Paul
without the walls, and have eight and forty thousand years of pardon. Who would
stand upon days, when he may have thus many thousand years? If thou be
weak or sick, and not able to visit a Church; then do but devoutly worship
the Cross, or the nails, whip, lance, heart or hands of Christ painted in
thy chamber, and that shall be a sufficient Dor^nam: of Antichrist. D. White:
the Way of the true Church. page 255.
satisfaction for all thy sins. Here is stuff with a witness! for can a man
forbear laughter to hear these May-games? and yet this is not the tenth part
of these incredible absurdities. But I pass them over, being sufficiently
discovered by others, to the shame of the Romish Religion. It suffices, that
by this little it is evident, that satisfactions are so far from restraining,
that they rather remit the reins to all liberty and licentiousness.

24. Lastly, to conclude, if so be their imposed penance be at any time strict
and severe, it is when the Pope i^ offended, not when God. Men may franckly sin
against God, and no man will say unto him, black is thine eye: or if upon his
shriuing they enjoin him penance, either it shall be so easy that it will not
much trouble him to endure it, or if it be too hard, he may either redeem it
with his purse, or at least commute it into another kind. But if their Lord god
the Pope be offended, (so the Canonists style him) then not only severity, but
cruelty must be exercised, then the whip and the scourge, then the fire and the
faggot: Et scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello: That Horace.
which deserved but a flap with a ferula, must be chastised with a scourge. As
on the contrary, if the offense was only against God, and not the Pope, then
that which deserved to be severely corrected, must have nothing but three flaps
with a Fox-tayle; which is credibly reported by some Writers, to have been the
penance of a Nun, which was gotten with Ethelr. Abbas de quod. mira.
child in her Cloister. Albeit another Nun at Watton in Yorkshire, fared
far worse for her wantonness with a young Monk of the same house: for being
gotten with child by him, she was first imprisoned, (says the Story) and then
beaten unreasonably, and unseasonably too, being great with child: then the
Monk that committed this trespass being taken and stripped, and bound fast to a
stool, a sharp knife was put into the Nuns hand, and she was compelled by
most cruel enforcement to take vengeance on those parts which had done her the
mischief, and to eat them also, with many other filthy circumstances, which I
shame to speak of; but in conclusion, to make up the matter with a miracle,
two midwiues were brought from heaven to Mistress Nun, by the ghost of Henry
Murdach the Archbishop of York, which discharged her of her child without
pain, and carried it forth with them to heaven (with lie and all) so that it
was never after seen. Is not this penance (think you) able to terrify any
one from committing the like sin? or rather, might not this Nun say as
another of her sex and profession said, Lumbard. Gratian. Comestor.
after she had had three Bastards, which proved great Clerks and learned men
in the Church, that it was a happy escape which brought forth three such worthy
bastards? so this might call her Son an happy Son, which was honored with
so great a miracle. But let the Popes laws be broken, or his triple Crown
touched, and he shall smoke for it that dares do this.

25. Their fourth doctrine tending (apparently, and by necessary consequence)
to loosnesse, is their doctrine of vowed chastity, whereby they enjoin single
life, and prohibit matrimony to certain kinds of men and women; to wit, such
as enter into holy orders, teaching and maintaining, that for Pighius cont. 15.
de caelibatu. Cost. enchir. cap. de caelib. prop. 9. Bell. li. 2. demon. cap.
30.
such it is better to go to harlots then to marry: and that to go to a harlot
now and then, is but a sin of infirmity (as Pighius calls it) but to
marry, is no better then a resolved, deliberate, or continual incest, utterly
without all shame. What an occasion, or rather a cause, this point of Romish
doctrine has been of horrible silthinesse and wickedness of life, woeful
experience, in all places where the Romish Religion bears sway, manifestly
declares. For to omit that this doctrine is but an vpstart doctrine, in
respect of true antiquity, brought in first by Pope Seritius three hundred and
eighty years after Christ, who was the first that made any restraint of
Priests marriages, as it is confessed by Polidore Virgill, the Polid. de
Invent. lib. 5. ca. 4. D. 82. plur. Clicto. de contin. Sacr. cap. 4.
decree on the Canon law, and Clictoueus; and yet took not effect until the
time of Gregory the seventh called Hidlebrand, in the year one thousand
seventy and four: as also, to omit that this doctrine is both contrary to the
precepts of holy Scripture, and practice of holy men, both under the law, and
under the Gospel: for under the law both Priests and Eusebius. li. 4. c. 23.
Athanas. epist. ad Dracon.
Prophets were married; and under the Gospel, both Apostles and Disciples had
their wives, and after them Bishops and Prestbyters: and the doctrine of the
Scripture is, Marriage Heb. 13. 4. 1. Cor. 7. 9. 1. Tim. 3. 2. Tit. 1. 6.
is honorable among all men: and again, If they cannot abstain, let them
marry, for it is better to marry then to burn: Yea, and Saint Paul gives
order concerning the wives and children of Bishops, which had been needless,
if they might have none. And lastly, to omit that this prohibiting of marriage
is called by Saint Paul one of the doctrines of devils, every 1. Tim. 4. 13.
one of which might be a sufficient argument, not only to euince the
unsoundness of this doctrine, but also to demonstrate how likely itmust needs
be to occasionate sin, coming not from God, and therefore not likely to have
his blessing to follow it; but from the devil, and therefore most likely to
serve for the advancement of his kingdom. Notwithstanding, to omit all these,
and to refer them to a fitter place, let us weigh this matter in the balance
of reason, and we shall easily find that a great breach is hereby made for
men's unruly and untoward affections, to burst forth into horrible and damnable
sins.

26. For first, the gift of Continency is no common, but a rare and singular
gift, which God bestows not upon all, but upon some few: this proposition is
proved by that aphorism of our Savior; All men cannot receive this thing,
save Math. 19. 11. 12
they to whom it is given: and in the next verse, He that is able to receive
it, let him receive it: Whereby he insinuates, that who so ever takes upon
him the vow of chastity, not being able to perform the same, sins in so
doing. It is proved also by Saint Paul in this conclusion, Every man has 1.
Cor. ^. 7.
his proper gift of God, one this way, another that way: for speaking of the
gift of continency, he wishes that all men were as he himself: but seeing
they are not so, therefore he leaves it free to marry for such as have not
that gift. But the Romish Clergy, together with the infinite orders of
religious Votaries, are not few but many, and those chosen promiscuously
without any respect had, whether they be endowed with that gift or no:
therefore, being unable to contain, and forbidden to use the lawful remedy
ordained by God, they must of necessity fall into lawless and inordinate
lusts: besides, seeing that every man that will, be he never so defamed for
incontinency, and so by experience known to be void of that same excellent
gift, may become a Votary, and on the contrary (our Savior says) every man
cannot receive this, what hope can there be of chastity among these men? Is the
gift of chastity indeed so common, that every man may have it that will? Is it
so ordinary, that it is communicated to thousands of Priests, Monks, Friars,
and Nuns? yea, to innumerable of that order in all places? why then, what
meant Cassander, a learned divine of their Cassand. Art. cap. 1.
own, to say, that the world was come to that pass, that a man could scarce
find one of an hundred, that kept himself free from Eras. annot. ^ 1. Tim. 3.
incontinency? And Erasmus, that the number of Monks, and Priests, that lived
in whoredom and incest, was innumerable: weigh the reason now in his just
terms, they that cannot contain, must needs burst forth, either into secret
or open uncleanness. But of infinite Romish votaries, few or none have that
gift to contain, therefore the rest must necessarily fall into either secret
or open uncleanness, let any man judge now, whether this doctrine does not
directly tend unto looseness.

27. If any allege that this gift of continency may be obtained by fasting
and prayer: I answer, two things. First, If it may be thus obtained, it is a
sign that they use but little the same holy exercises, seeing few among them
do attain unto it. Secondly, I answer, that continency is in the number of
those gifts, which may be denied to a man salua salute, without danger of his
salvation, because it is not necessary to salvation, nor common to all Gods
children, but peculiar to some. Now the promise of our Savior, ask, and ye
shall have, is meant of things necessary to salvation, and not of particular
and special gifts. Thus Paul prayed thrice, that the prick in the flesh, the
messenger of Satan might be removed 2. Cor. 12.
from him: (and some say this was concupiscence) yet he was not heard in that
which he prayed for, because he might be saved without it, as it appeared in
the answer given unto him: my grace is sufficient for thee. And besides, what
is it but a te^pting of God, to refuse the ordinary remedy which God has
ordained, which is marriage, and to fly to extraordinary means? as if a man
should refuse all bodily sustenance on earth, in hope that God will feed him
extraordinarily from Psalm. 34.
heaven at his devout request, because he has promised that those which fear
him, shall want nothing, and whatsoever we ask in the name of Christ, shall be
granted. Let Saint Augustine determine this doubt, whose resolution is this
concerning all things which men pray for, which are not necessary to salvation.
Aliquando Deus iratus, dat quod petis, and Deus Aug. Ser. 53. de verb. Dom. etc.
propitius negat quod petis. Sometimes God grants in anger, and sometimes
denies in mercy, that which thou desire. And let Origens practice put it
out of all doubt, who to avoid incontinencie, and to quench the fiery lusts of
the flesh, offered violence to his own flesh, by cutting off those parts wherein
concupiscence reigns. If he had been pers^aded, that by fasting and prayer
he could have obtained that gift from heaven, surely he would have macerated
his body with the one, and brawned his knees with the other, rather then to
have fallen to that desperate and unnatural remedy.

28. But to leave this their vain objection, and to come a little nearer to
the point, how can that doctrine choose but lead to loosenes, which crosses
not only the ordinance of God, who was the first ordainer of Marriage, but
also the instinct Genes. 3.
of nature; for this was naturally instilled into all living Creatures,
especially Man, at the first creation, that he should increase and multiply: by
virtue of which institution of nature, Genes. 1.
a desire is engrafted in all the posterity of Adam, of the propagation of
their kind, that they may (as it were) live in their succession. And whereas
Bellarmine obiecteth, that these Bell. de Cler. lib. 1. cap. 21.
words ( Increase and multiply) contain not a precept, but an institution of
nature, and a promise of fecundity, because the same words are uttered to other
Creatures, which are not capable of precepts, and also because if it were a
precept, it should bind all to increase and multiply, and so imurie should be
offered to Christ, to Marie, and other holy virgins. I answer, that a^beit
one member of his reason is unsound, to wit, that beasts are incapable of
precepts; for God spoke to the Fish, and it cast up Jonah on the dry land;
which shows, that beasts in their Jonas 2. 10.
kind understand Gods precepts, and obey; yet we do not say that this is an
absolute precept, binding all without exception to marriage, but only a
liberty granted to all that will, to marry, that thereby mankind may be still
propagated: and therefore they which take away this liberty from all
ecclesiastical persons, and monastical Votaries, offer injury to nature, and
tyrannize over the bodies and souls of men. For, whence arises this necessary
conclusion, that the vow of single life is repugnant to nature, and therefore
none may take it upon them, but those either in whom nature is defective,
which our Savior says were borne chaste from their mothers Mat. 19 12. Basil
de vera virginitate.
belly, or that are endowed with a supernatural gift, as our blessed Savior,
the blessed Virgin his mother, and other holy men and women: and so by
consequent it follows, because this gift is rare and extraordinary, that most
of them (which by a rash vow bind themselves from marriage) should fall into
fornication and promiscuous lust. The course of nature in mankind is like the
source of a running stream, which by no dammes, nor artificial bars can be
stopped, but it will run either the natural course in the channel, or some
other by-passage, and that the more it is stopped, the more violently it
rages, except the fountain and spring be dried up. So, except the fountain
of concupiscence in incontinent persons be dried up by a supernatural and
extraordinary work, the more it is interrupted, the more outragiously it
fometh. Therefore if the ordinary channel of marriage be dammed up, it must
needs burst over the banks of lawfulnes, and spread it self over the pastures
and meadows of adjoining neighbors. This is the very case of our Romish
shauelings, being barred from marriage: they burst sorth like wild Bulls into
other men's grounds, and defile their beds by adultery, and fill their houses
with bastardy.

29. If they challenge to themselves the supernatural gift of continency,
experience shows, that their challenge is vain, for not one of an hundred of
them lives chastely: and besides, as God has given that gift often to the
heathen and reprobate, as Histories report, so very often, yea, most ordinarily
does he deny it to his own children: for ordinary grace does not abolish, but
sanctify nature; so that this i^ no gift of ordinary saving grace, but a
superordinary work above grace, and that also many times without grace. If
then it be not in the power of any to quench the instincts of nature, if ^t be
not a work of ordinary grace to abolish nature, but it requires extraordinary
grace for the effecting thereof; if the course of nature be stopped one way, it
will burst forth another: then we may by sound reason conclude, that the vow
of chastity and single life, and the prohibition of marriage in the Church of
Rome does open a wide gappe to all loose and licencious living.

30. Lastly, that all this is true, let the lamentable effects and fruits of
this their doctrine stand up for witness and vmp^ers in this matter; for, how
shall a man better judge of the goodness of the cause, then by the effects? a
good ^ree cannot Matthew. 7.
bring forth evil fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit; every tree is known
by his fruit: and albeit often that which is not the cause, is put for the
cause, and by the accidental failing of the medium, or instrument, the cause
may miss of his proper effect: Yet, when the effects are not rare, but
frequent, yea, infinite; and such as are so like, that they seem (as it were)
of one stamp, and (as it were) all eggs of one bird: then it must needs
follow, that parentem sequitur sua proles, like child, like parent, such as
the effect, such must the cause needs be. To begin with Nicholas, one of the
seven Deacons, the prime Author of the sect of the Nicholaitans condemned by
Saint John, Apoc. 2. Let Epiphanius tell us what Epiph. tom. 2. lib. 1. haeres.
2^.
his opinion was, and what fruits issued therefrom. This Nicholas having a
beautiful wife, when he saw others in admiration for their single life, that
he might not seem inferior to them, utterly renounced the company of his
wife, and determined never to have fellowship with her again. But when he was
not able to repress any longer the flame of concupiscence, and being ashamed
to return to his wife, lest he should be condemned of inconstancy, he chose
rather to give over himself to all manner of unlawful lust, yea, to that
which is against nature. And from hence sprang the sect of the Nicholaitans,
whose chief opinion was this, that if so be they could abstain from lawful
marriage, it was no sin to defile themselves with any other filthy or
unlawful copulation. Here we may behold a perfect map of the Romish single
life, with the fruits thereof. This happened in the first period of the
primitive Church.

31. Afterward in the Nicene Synod, when some went about Socr. li. 1. ca. 11*
Soz. li. 1. ca 23.
to prohibit marriage to the Clergy: Paphnutius a great learned Father of that
assembly, gaine-said with great vehemence the proceeding of that decree; giving
this for one principal reason, that it would be the cause of horrible
impurity and obscaenity in the Ecclesiastical order; which, to be a true
prophecy, the event afterward has manifestly declared. After this, about the
six hundredth year of our Huldericus Au* epistol.
Lord, it is reported of Gregory the great, that when he saw the heads of
more than six thousand infants taken out of a Fish Pond, he sighed, and
confessed that the decree of single life in the Clergy, was the cause thereof;
and therefore condemning that decree, he commended the Apostles counsel, that
it was better to marry, then to burn, and added this moreover, that it was
better to marry, then to give occasion to murder.

32. After this, in the year eight hundred and sixty, Huldericus Hulder.
August. epist. ad Nich. 1.
Bishop of Augusta in Germany, in his Epistle to Pope Nicholas the first, most
lively describes the filthy fruits of Popish single life, his words be these,
Nullum tam grave facinus, etc. There is no so great offense, which is not to be
admitted, to the end that a greater then that may be avoided. Notwithstanding,
many flatterers desirous to please men, not God, under a false show of
continency commit greater sins, to wit, they defile their Fathers wives, they
abhor not the embracings of men and brute beasts, though they be of the most
holy order, they make no scruple to abuse other men's wives: And when as
certain Bishops, and Archdeacons, are so given over to lust, that they cannot
abstain, neither from adulteries, nor incests, nor other filthy and vnnameable
sins; yet they affirm, that the chaste marriages of Priests do stincke in
their nosthrils, and forbid, yea, constrain Clergy men to abstain from them:
saying, that it is more honest to be entangled with many whores in secret, then
to be tied to one wife in public. But, woe be to you Pharisecs, which do all
to be seen of men. These be the express words of that reverend Bishop: after
he thus concludes, Whilst the Clergy are constrained by Pharisaicall fury to
give over the lawful fellowship of one wife, they are made fornicators,
adulterers, and workers of other most filthy abominations, and that which with
tears we behold, all of them rage in such wickedness. Hence it is that the
Church of God is so scandalized, and the Clergy so despised. Who sees not by
this testimony of this great learned man in the very heat and midst of
Popery, what fruits this doctrine then brought forth?

33. After, in the year one thousand and eighty, when that brand of hell
Hidlebrand, otherwise called Gregory the seventh, sat in the Roman seat, who
labored earnestly to bring in that tyrannical decree upon the Clergy in
Germany: Auentinus thus writes, Gratum hoc fuit scortatoribus, Auentinus.
quibus, etc. This was acceptable to whoremongers, to whom now it was lawful,
in stead of one wife, to have the fellowship of six hundred harlots. Hence
many false Prophets took occasion by fables and miracles to cast mists over
the truth, and by drawing places of Scripture to their purpose, to deceive the
people. In a word, when as very few did truly make war with lust, and some
did feign continency for gain sake, the greatest part, under the honest name
of chastity, did commit whoredoms, incests, adulteries every where without
punishment: thus writes Auentine touching those times.

34. After this, in the year 1102. in a Synod at London, where Anselme the
Archbishop of Canterbury labored with tooth and nail to interdict Priests of
the use of lawful marriage, allowed before unto them by King William; many
opposed themselves against him, saying, it would be very dangerous, Ne dum
mundicias viribus maiores appeterent, etc. L^st, while they desired greater
purity then their strength was able to bear, they should fall into horrible
uncleanness, to the great ignominy of Christian Religion. And when as
notwithstanding Anselme had effected this prohibition, the next year after
complaint was made unto him, that in stead of marriage forbidden, the horrible
sin of Sodomie reigned over all England, and from the Clergy crept also into
the Laity; which he endeavored to restrain also, but all in vain: for the
ordinance of God being neglected, what can the wisdom and laws of man do
good?

35. But were the latter ages any whit better reformed? Bernard. De conuers. ad
Clericos cap. 29.
peradventure, in these six hundred years last past, the Popish Clergy,
were more holy and less licencious. Let Saint Bernard be judge of his times;
If (says he) according to the Prophecy of Ezekiel, we should dig through
the wall, that we might look into Gods house, there will peradventure appear
within the wall a filthy abomination; for after fornications succeed
adulteries, after incests, the passions of ignominy and works of filthiness
are not wanting. I would to God that it neither behooued the Apostle to write
these things, nor us to relate them, that it might not be believed, that such
abominable lust possessed the mind of man. Alas, the enemy of mankind has
besprinckled the body of the Church with the execrable ashes of Sodom, and
that many of the very ministers thereof: And in the end he thus concludes; Many
(I say, not all) yet many (they can neither be hidden for multitude, neither do
they seek to be hidden for impudency) I say, many seem to have given liberty
to the occasion of the flesh, a^bstaining from the remedy of marriage, and
bursting forth into all manner of wickedness. Again, the same Bernard in
another place thus complains, Toll de Ecclesia, etc. Take Ber. sup. cant.
ser. 66.
from the Church honorable marriage, and the bed undefiled, and thou shall
fill it full of whoremongers, incestuous persons, bugg^rers, and all kind of
unclean ones. And a little before in the same Sermon he gives the reason
hereof, Omni immunditiae laxat habenas qui nuptias damnat: He that condemns
marriage, lets loose the reins to all uncleanness.

36. Robert Holket an English man, and a Dominican Friar, Holket sup. sap.
lect. 173.
that lived in the year of our Lord one thousand three hundred and forty,
thus complains of the corruption in the Clergy of his time, Sed proh dolor,
etc. But alas, in these days the saying of Job is verified, Behold, they that
serve the Lord, are not stable and constant, etc. For of the Priests some be
Angels of Satan by discord and contention, some Apostatious by pride, some be
filthy spirits by rioutousnesse and uncleanness, and some Angels of the
bottomless pit, by covetousness; and a little after, Not a few of our modern
Priests do serve the most vild and filthy God Priapus. Panormitane, a man of
great fame in the Council of Basil, after he had shown the vow of
continency not to be Panor. par. 3. de Cler. coniug. cap. cum olim.
of the essence of Priesthood, nor by the law of God, but a constitution of
the Church, adds these words: I believe that it were a wholesome ordinance
for the good and salvation of souls, to leave it to m^ns own wills to marry,
or not, because experience does show, that now a days they do not live
spiritually and vndefiledly, but that they are defiled by unlawful copulation,
whereas they might live chastely with their own wives.

37. I could add unto these testimonies the report of John Gerson, touching
his time: who complained that some Cloisters Gers. tom. 1. decl. defect. vir.
Eccl. Lib. 1. fastor.
of Nuns were become Stews of strumpets and whores. And of Mantuan a
Carmelite Italian Friar, whose verses touching this point are sufficiently
known.

Patrum vita fuit melior cum coniuge, quam nunc
Nostra sit, exclusis thalamis and coniugis vsu.
The life of the Fathers was better being married, then ours to whom marriage
is forbidden: and of Polidor Virgill, who Polydor. Virg. de Invent. li. 5. ca.
4.
lived in King Henry the Eights days; whose censure is this, that this
enforced chastity is so far from excelling that marriage-chastity, that no
crime has brought more shame to the order of Priesthood, more evil to
Religion, nor more grief to all good men, then that blot of the filthiness of
Priests. But that I fear I have too much offended chaste ears already, with
raking into this dunghill, I conclude with the report of Martin Luther, he
says, that he saw Cardinals at Rome, which were accounted holy for no other
cause, but that they were content only to commit fornication and adultery with
women, and did not give themselves to other unnatural lusts. Thus, as it were
in a map, I have described the filthy and abominable fruits that proceed
from that Romish doctrine of vowed chastity. Is it possible that the spring
should be good, when the streams are thus corrupt?

38. The fifth doctrine of Popery (giving manifest occasion 5.
of liberty to the professors thereof) is their doctrine of venial sins. By
which they teach, that many acts which are transgressions of the laws of God
and men, yet are not properly sins, nor deserve the wrath of God, but of their
nature are pardonable; and therefore he which commits any such, Henr. Sum.
mor. cap. 20. lib. 4. Tho. par. 3. q. 83. and 81. art. 3. Ouand. 4. d. 16.
Pinwood. li. 3. de celeb. miss. Gregor. de Val. tom. 3. p. 1090.
does neither offer injury to God, nor break charity in respect of his
neighbor, and so deserves not hell, nor is bound to be sorry for them, but
that the knocking of the breast, going to Church, being sprinkled with holy
water, or the Bishops blessing, or crossing ones self, or doing any work of
charity, though we never think actually of them, is a sufficient satisfaction
for them. This is the doctrine not only of the Schoolmen, but also of the
finest, and refyning Jesuits, even of Bellarmine himself, who thus
distinguishes venial Bellar. de omiss. great. and stat. peccati lib. 1. ca. 3.
sins, that some are venial of their own nature and kind, to wit, such as
have for their object an evil and inordinate matter, but which is not
repugnant to the law of God, and of our neighbor: others are venial by the
imperfection of the work, which imperfection arises partly, ex surreptione,
that is, by unadvised falling into them, without full consent of will; and
partly, ex paruitate materiae, by the smalnesse of the matter which is
committed, as if a man should steal a halfe-peny, or some such trifle. This is
the Cardinals doctrine, which (as near as I could) I hau^ word for word set
down. And that we may more fully understand their meaning, they affirm in
very deed that they are no sins, but aequiuoce, that is so called, but not
^o in truth; for the word peccatum, sin, does not vniuoce, a^^ee (...)eniall
Bellar. de amiss. great. and stat. peccat. lib. 1. cap. 12. 1. Ioh. 3.
sins, as it does to mortal; and therefore it is their general opinion,
that they are not against, but beside the law, that is in plain words, not
sin: for every sin is a transgression of the law. Now, let the Readeriudge
whether our doctrine, that all sins of their own nature are mortal, and
deserve condemnation, except they be repented of, or heirs, that some are
venial, and bind not the offender to condemnation, do more tend to liberty:
whether we restrain more the people from sinning, that thus say unto them, All
your sins (though never so small) are of their own nature damnable, except
by faith in the blood of Christ they be purged away, and by repentance, which
is a fruit of faith sorrowed for, and labored against: or they that say thus
to them, A number of your ordinary sins, are not damnable, you need not
faith in Christ's blood to purge them; nor repentance to bewail them; nor care
and endeavor to prevent them: who sees not that our doctrine pulls in, and
theirs lets out the reins of liberty to our corrupt nature? for when a man
believes that he may do many things, which are in deed transgressions of Gods
law, without offense to God, or hurt to his neighbor, or wounding of his own
conscience; and, that after he has committed them, he needs not greatly to
repent of them, or to be sorry for them; but that they are done away by saying
a Lords prayer, or hearing a Mass, or creeping to a Cross, or receiving a
little Holy water; what need he make any conscience of these so slight
trifles; nay, how can he choose but neglect and make light account of them?
This is one of the devils subtle devices or iuggling tricks which Saint Paul
speaks of, where with he labors 2. Cor. 2.11.
to seduce simple souls, for either he will aggrauate our sins to drive us
to desperation, or extenuate and excuse them to draw to presumption: the rock
and gulf whereat many thousand souls suffer shipwreck. And this last the
most dangerous, wherein the Papists show themselves the devils agents and
factours, by this their doctrine of venial sins: for what is this but to
excuse sin, and to extenuate it, and so to make men presume to commit those
things which they esteem of no greater moment?

39. The truth of this will more clearly appear, if we take a suruay a
little of those particular sins, which they account as venial. To swear by
the blood of God, or wounds, or body of Christ, is no blasphemy (says
Cardinal Caietane) if it Caietan. in sum. page 49.
be spoken in a brawle, or in some perturbation of mind, neither is it to be
counted any more than a venial sin. Again, formal cursing (says Gregory
de Valentia) although in it own kind it Grego. de Val. tom 3. pa. 1090.
be a mortal sin; yet it may be only a venial, to wit, in respect either
of the smalnesse of the matter, or the want of deliberation in the speaker: and
hereby (says he) Parents cursing their children with bitter words, and
deuoting them to the devil, may often M^l. tract. 2. ca 9 con. 1. pro. 5.
be excused from mortal sin. An officious lie, and a lie in sport, are but
venial sins (says Molanus:) the same Author affirms, that if any man
steal some little thing, suppose an half penny, (as Bellarmine gives
instance) whereby no notable Bell de amiss. great. and stat peccat. lib. 1. ca.
3.
hurt is caused, this is to be esteemed no mortal sin. Again, rash
judgment (though consent be added thereto) is regularly but a venial sin:
so also is the painting of the face (says Molanus.) Molan ibidem.
Cardinal Caietane reckons up a number such like, as for example. page 18.
Partiality in judgment, and acception of person, if it be not pernicious.

Idleness; if it have no other mischief to accompany it. These, and a number
such like are reckoned up by that Author; to which I might add many more out
of other Romish writers, but these may suffice for our purpose, to demonstrate
what liberty this doctrine gives to loosnesse. For hence men may be bold to
swear, to curse, to rail, to back-bite, to steal, to be drunk, to be idle,
etc. and cloak all under this veil, They are but venial sins. Yea, and
because the common people are not able to understand their nice distinctions
of, against, and beside charity; surreption, and irruption; great and small
damage, etc. therefore often gross and great sins creep in under the name
of venials; if this be not a doctrine of liberty, what is?

40. The sixth and last doctrine tending to loosnesse (the 6.
last, I mean, of those which I intend to propound in this Discourse, for
there are many more that tend to the same end) is their doctrine of implicit
and infolded faith; where by they teach, that if a man know some necessary
points of Religion, as the doctrine of the Godhead of the Trinity, of Christ's
incarnation and Passion, etc. it is needless to busy himself about the rest
by a particular or distinct knowledge: but it suffices to give assent to the
Church, and to believe as the Pastors believe. This implicit faith is the
mother of ignorance, and this ignorance (say they is) the mother of devotion:
but what kind of devotion I pray you? such as the mother is, such is the
daughter, a blind mother, and Romans 10. 2. Acts 3. 17.
a blind daughter: such a devotion and zeal which the Jews had, when they
crucified Christ; or as Saint Paul Acts 22. 3. 4.
had, when he persecuted the Church of Christ; or which the Gentiles had, when
they thought they did God good service Ioh. 16. 2.
by putting to death the primitive Christians. Like Poliphemus, when his eye
was bored out by Ulysses, dashed himself ^ortull.
against every rock: so do these blind Romanists, the eye of knowledge being
bored out by this pernicious doctrine, dash themselves against the rock of
Heresy in matter of faith, and impiety in manners: for all error in doctrine
arises from ignorance of the Scriptures, You err, not knowing Mat. 22. 19.
the Scripture, and the power of God, says our Savior: and erring in manners,
proceeds from the same fountain; for if the hyding of Gods word in the
heart, is a preservative against sin, as the Prophet David avouches: then
the ignorance Psalm. 119. 11.
of Gods word must needs be the cause of many errors and enormities in life.
To this agrees the opinion of Chrysostom; Scripturarum ignoratio haereses
peperit: haec vitam corruptam Chrysostom. de Laz and Diuite, Hom. 3.
inuexit, haec sursum ac deorsum omniamiscuit. The ignorance of Scripture has
bred heresies, brought in corruption of life, and turned all things vpside
down. And also of Saint Hierome, Hierom.
who says plainly, Ama scientia^ Scripturarum, and carnis vitia non amabis.
Love the knowledge of the Scriptures, and thoushalt not love the vices of the
flesh. Whereby he gives us to understand, that where there is no love of
knowledge, Ibid hom. 13. in 2. Cor. Greg. Niss. orat. de ijs qui adeunt Hierus.
there must needs be the love of vice: the reason is manifest, because the
Scripture is a most exquisite rule and exact squire to try all our actions by,
as Chrysostom calls it, and a straight and inflexible rule, as Gregory
Nissen terms it. Now, if this rule, squire and balance be hid from us, how
can we square our actions aright? how can we give them their just poyse and
weight? As the Carpenter that has lost his rule and line, cannot but err
grossly in his work: So the Christian that is deprived of this knowledge of
Gods word, must needs run into infinite foul and gross enormities.

41. From this fountain, conjoined with those which went before, springs the
monstrous corruption of manners in all places, wh^^ Popery reigns: especially
in Italy and Rome, under the Popes nose. They object to us the great and
horrible disorder and corruption which is among Protestants; but we on the
other side, as we stand not to justify our selves in this kind, but rather be
wail the profaneness of all estates in these days, even under the Gospel;
so we dare boldly say, that in the time of Popery heretofore, and in places
where it now swayeth, their impiety and profaneness does as far exceed
ours, as a great mountain does a little molehill. Of all Countries in the
world, Italy is the Popes own peculiar: and yet that is the very siacke of
the world for sin; witness Aencas Siluius, who lived almost Aencas Sil. Com.
in dicto and sacto Alphons.
two hundred years since, who says, that it was the Italian fashion to live
by robbery, and to trample under focte all equity and religion. And for the
modern times, witness the common proverb. An Englishman Italionate, a devil
incarnate. Rome is the Popes own ^eate, for it is the spiritual Babylon,
built upon seven hills, and yet that is the sincke of Italy, witness their own
Mantuan. I pudor in villas, etc. Mant. li. 2. Fast.


Vrbs est iam tot a lupanar. Depart honesty into Villages, the City is wholly
become a Stews, and Trauailors report, it was never so evil as it is at this
day; witness their own pasquill.

Roma vale, vidi, satis est vidisse, reuertar,
Cum leno, aut meretrix, scurra, cynaedus ero.
Now farewell Rome, I have thee seen; it was enough to see:
I will return when as I mean, Bawd, Pander, Knave to be.
As if there were none but such at Rome.

42. And this the best of them (against their wills) acknowledge, when they
confess Rome to be mystical Babylon: for why is Rome so styled in the
Scripture, but because it resembles the Assyrian Babylon in pride, idolatry,
filthiness, and especially in most cruel persecution of the Church of God?
and for the same cause it is called spiritual Sodom and Egypt: Sodeme, for
pride and filthiness, Egypt, for Idolatry and cruelty. The Popes court is the
Popes own Sanctum Sanctorum, if in reverence to that holy place I may so say,
yet that is the sincke of the City. Witness Catherina Senensis that holy
woman, whom Pope Pius the second canonized for a Saint, who thus complained,
that in the Court of Rome, where should be A^^o. ^^^t. 3. ^it. ^3. cap. 14.
a delicate Paradise of virtues, she sound a stincke of hellish vices.
Concerning the whole state of the Roman Church, both Lai^ty and Clergy, hear
what the judgment of Durand Duran. de^oncil. ^^t. ^7.
was in his time; Desperata est salus Romanae Ecclesiae, etc. The salvation of
the Roman Church is desperate; of which is verified the sayings of the Prophet
Esaias, (It shall be a bed of Dragons:) Card. All ac. de reform. Eccles.
and of Petrus de Alliaco; a Cardinal in his time, Ad eum statum venit, etc.
The Roman Church is come to that state, that it is not worthy to be governed
but by reprobates. And of Platina himself, the Popes own Secretary, Hac
nostra aetate Platina d^ vita M^^.
(says he) vitia co crcuerunt, etc. In this our age vices are so increased,
that they seem to have scarce left us any place in Gods mercy, etc. After the
Council of Trent, which promised a reformation, hear how a Bishop of their
own, Espensaeus Epis. Espen. com. in tit.
complains; All hope (says he) of reformation is taken away: where under the
Sun is there greater licenciousnes, clamor, impurity, I will not say
madness, and impudency, then in this City? such, and so great, as none can
believe, but he which has seen it; none can deny, but he which has not seen
it. I could heap up many like testimonies for the clearing of this point, but
it is needless, seeing that all that have either gotten experimental
knowledge by their travails, or speculatiue by their reading, can and will
justify the truth of this position, that in no place of the world, more
impiety, atheism, impurity, cruelty, poisoning treachery, and all manner of
villainy reigns, then in Italy the Popes own dominions, and in Rome under
his Holiness nose. So that for shame (but that the whore of Babylon, and her
adherents have brazen foreheads) they may cease to lay that imputation of
loosnesse and wickedness of life upon us and our Religion, and assume the
aspersion of it unto themselves, being far more guilty, and their religion
directly tending thereunto, by these six maine grounds which I have in this
first motive propounded to the judgment of every indifferent Reader: The Lord
of his mercy open our eyes, that we may discern the truth, and our hearts,
that we may love it, and embrace it.

MOTIVE. II. That religion, which maintains by the grounds thereof things
forbidden, by all laws both of God, of Nature, and of Man, cannot be the true
religion: but such is the religion of the Roman Church: Ergo.
THe first proposition in this reason is unquestionable and MAYOR.
without controversy: for the law of God is one part of true religion, as the
Gospel is the other: and therefore whatsoever contradicts this law, is opposite
unto true religion, and so cannot be true religion it self: for truth is not
opposite unto truth, but falsehood: and the law of nature is nothing but the
law of God, engraven in the hearts of all men by the instinct of nature, which
Tullie calls a law engendered, not Cic. pro Milon. Lex nota non data.
imposed, borne with us, not laid upon us. And the positive laws of men, if
they be good, are nothing else but extracts out of the law of God, and
characters of the law of nature. That religion therefore that crosses all
these laws by allowance of such things, which are by them all condemned,
cannot in any wise be the true religion, but must needs stand guilty of
falshoode and error. Now, that the Romish religion is such MINOR.
(which is the second proposition in the reason) that is my task to prove, and
I hope I shall by invincible arguments make good the same.

1. And first, what can be more contrary to the laws of I.
God, of Nature, of Man, then treason and rebellion against Princes? for the
law of God commands civil obedience to the Magistrate, by the first precept
of the second Table: and our Savior in the Gospel bids to give to Caesar
those Matthew. 22. 2^.
things that belong unto Caesar: and Saint Paul charge every soul to be
subject to the higher powers, because all power is of God: Romans 13. ^.
even tyrannical power, as our Savior confesses to Pilate: Thou had no
power over me, except it was given thee from above: Ioh. 19. 11.
where he acknowledges, that Pilates power (though he was a tyrant) was of
God; and therefore submits himself unto it. As for the law of nature, it
requires as much of all; for as in the body natural, all the outward members
and inward faculties are governed by reason, residing in the head, and in the
body oiconomike, all the family is directed by the Father or Master thereof:
so in the body politic, all the members of a Commonwealth must by natures
decree be obedient to the King or governor, whom to resist, is to rebel
against nature, as it is against nature for the member to mutiny against the
head; or for children and servants to be disobedient to their Fathers or
Masters: Neither are the laws positive any whit behind: for no offense by
law is more severely punished, then crimen laesae Maiestatis, that is, high
treason against the Kings person or State: and that not only in this our
Kingdom, but in all others, as is sufficiently known.

2. Now, that the Romish doctrine and religion is a supporter of treason, and
an animater of traitors against their Sovereigns; I call to witness, first,
their own principles, and secondly, their practice. Their principles are
these: As Toll. Instr. Sacer. lib. 1. cap. 13.
long as the Prince continues excommunicate, the Subject is freed from the
oath of subjection: this is the Position of a Cardinal, whose authority was so
great in the Church of Rome, that whatsoever he wrote, was allowed as sound and
authentical, without examination or supervizing. To him I add a Simanc. Inst.
lib. 23. Sect. 11.
Bishop, whose writings, after supervision and examination, were approved as
Catholic doctrine, and to contain in them nothing contrary to the received
faith of the Roman Church: his Position is this, As Soon as a Christian King
becomes heretical, forthwith people are freed from their subjection. The
condition in the first Position is, if the King be excommunicate: in the
second, if he be heretical; which though different in terms, yet in substance
are all one, for every heretic is excommunicate, quatenus aperte haereticus,
in that Val. Ies. tom. ^. in Them. disp. 1. qu. 12.
he is an open heretic, if not by name, yet in deed, and by right, and so
Subjects may lawfully deny him obedience, says another Jesuit: and what is an
heretic in their divinity, Alph. de Cast. l. 1. de just. punit. haer. cap. 10.
I pray you? Marry, Whosoever maintains any doctrine expressly condemned by
the Church of Rome, he is to be accounted (say they) an obstinate heretic.
To these add the sentence of another Cardinal, even our own Countriman Al-
in his Apology for Stanlies treason, who joins both these two conditions
together as two twins. By reason (says he) Cardinal Allen.
of Queen Elizabeth's excommunication and heresy, it was not only lawful for
any of her Subjects, but even they were bound in conscience, to deprive her of
any strength, which lay in their power to do, and to deliver her Armies,
Towns, or fortresses into her enemies hands, she no more being the right owner
of them. But all this while we have not the pillar of Popery, Bellarmine, it
may be he is of another mind: hear therefore his resolution. Non licet
Christianis tolerare, etc. It is not lawful for Bell. de Romans po^t. lib. 5
cap. 7.
Christians to tolerate a King that is an infidel, or an heretic, if he
endeavor to draw his Subjects to his heresy or infidelity. This is brave
Bellarmines resolution of this case. Neither does he barely set it down, but
labors to prove it by many arguments throughout that whole Chapter: indeed
he pinneth it all upon the Popes sleeue; he must pronounce the King to be an
heretic, and they like sheep must avoid him as a wolf; he must forbid them
to obey, and they must forthwith fall to rebellion: that whole seventh Chapter
is worth the reading, if any desire to know the full and complete doctrine of
the Romish Church, concerning the point of rebellion and treason against
Princes. And that this was the doctrine not of some few among them, but of all
in general: Let a Friar of Sigebert. Chron. Anno 1088.
their own testify about three hundred years since; Sigebert mencioning the
Popes proceeding against Henry the Emperor, thus writes; Be it spoken with the
leave of all good men, this nouelty, that I say not heresy, had not as yet
sprung up in the world, that Gods Priests should teach the people that they owe
no subjection to evil Princes, and though they have sworn allegiance to them,
yet they owe them no fidelity, neither shall he be accounted perjured which
thinks against the King, yea, he that obeys him shall be counted for
excommunicate, and he that does against him shall be absolved from the guilt of
injustice and perjury. Here we may behold the doctrine of that age, and
withal, that by this Friars judgment concurring with us, it is not only
nouelty, but a point of heresy to dissolve the bond of allegea^ce, which
Subjects owe unto their Princes, upon any pretense whatsoever.

3. But all these are but the opinions of private men, and not the decrees of
the Church: hear therefore what the Church speaks, by the pretended head
thereof the Pope, who (as they affirm) cannot err whilst he sits in the
chair of Peter, to determine matters of faith. Gregory the seventh, Gratian.
^^^. 15. q. 6.
alias, Hildobrand, thus determines, We by Apostolical authority do absolve
all from their oaths which they have given to persons excommunicate. And
another Pope of later time, in his Bull against Queen Elizabeth, thus; We
absolve all Subjects from Bulla Pij Quin.
their faith they have plight with Elizabeth their Queen. A third Pope Paulus
Tertius did excommunicate Henry the Eight, Pet. Math. Cem. in bull. Pij Quin.
King of England, and commanded his nobles to bear arms against him: and to
make up the full squadron of Popes, when as the University of Salamanca
determined, that all Catholics which did not forsake the defense of the
English, and follow the traitor One all in Ireland, did sin mortally, and
could not obtain everlasting life, except they should desist: Pope Xistus
gives this censure of their determination, Lib. de iusta abdic. Hen. 3. pa.
370.
Those Divines (says he) have done the parts of good Lawyers, Confessors, and
Doctors. Many more testimonies to this effect might be accumulated, but these
are sufficient (because we shall have occasion to speak hereof more at large
hereafter) to all that are not either bewitched with the enchantments of the
whore of Babylon, or blinded with prejudice, to show how both in their
principles and their practice, they maintain treason and rebellion against
Princes, contrary to the laws of God, of nature, and of man.

4. A doctrine Cousin german unto this, and of the same kind, 2.
though not of the same degree, is that their Position touching the dissoluing
of all bonds of natural and civil society: whereby they resolve, that no
communion or fellowship is to be held with heretics, that is, with
Protestants, by whatsoever bond of nature or ciuility they be obliged
thereunto: and therefore the Father is bound to dis-inherite and cast off his
Son, the Son to deny and disobey his Father, the wife is forbidden to
render due benevolence to her husband, the servant is commanded to disobey his
Master, the debtor to deny payment to his Creditor, the Countriman to deny his
own Country, the kinsman to disclaim his kindred, if any of these be
heretics, that is, be Protestants. What a religion is this, that not only
choaketh the breath of humane society, but even stifleth the life of nature it
self? He that desires to see these things proved, let them read Doctor
Mortons first Book of Romish positions and practices of rebellion, and also
his reply unto the moderate answer, where he shall find them largely and
foundly discovered and confirmed.

5. Again, by their doctrine of equivocation, they teach and maintain open
and notorious lying and perjury, such as the very heathen of stricter life and
simpler judgment abhorred: their doctrine is this; A man (says Tollet) is not
always Toll. li. 4. de Just. Sacerd. ca. 21.
bound to answer according to the meaning of the asker, but may sometimes use
equivocation, and deceive the hearer: this is lawful (says he) when the Judge
requires an oath against justice, or when he is not a competent Judge (as
another speaks:) as for example, if the Judge demand, Have thou done this? he
may answer, I have not (though he have) with this secret meaning, to tell it
thee, or at this time, or some such like things. And if an husband ask his
wife whether she be an adulteress, she may answer no (though she be) with
this mental reservation [to reveal it to him] and if a man be constrained to
swear that he will take a woman to his wife, he may do it safely although he
never mean it, with this close clause in his mind (if she shall after please
him.) Thus far Tollet.

6. Now of late days, one has divulged a whole Treatise in defense of this
monstrous doctrine; to the which Blackwell the Archpriest has given this
solemn approbatio^, that it is a very godly, learned and Catholic Tractate,
and worthy to be published in print, to the comfort of the afflicted, and
instruction of the godly. The author of this Tractate thus concludes, If a
Catholic or any other person shall be demanded upon his oath before a
Magistrate, whether a Priest be in such a place, he may (though he know the
contrary) securely in conscience answer, No, without perjury, with a secret
meaning reserved in his mind, namely, that he is not there, so as a man is
bound to reveal him. Again, if one shall ask me whether such a stranger
lies in my house, I may answer, he lies not in my house (albeit he do)
meaning Non mentitur: this last is verbal equivocation, the former is mental
reservation, which are the two approved kinds of their equiuocating art.

7. If this filthy strumpet be not the mother of two foul daughters, Lying,
and Perjury: lying, if by a bare asseueration; perjury, if joined with an oath:
let all that have but common sense and reason judge, and let the Enquest that
shall enquire into this matter be, first, heathen Philosophers; secondly, the
Popish writers themselves; thirdly, the Fathers and Doctors of the Church; and
fourthly, which is of greater moment then all the rest, the holy Scripture of
God divinely inspired, and cannot deceive, nor be deceived. Let us hear the
Philosophers verdict; A Lie, says Tully, is a false Tullie.
enunciation of words, with an intent to deceive: and again, he defines dolus
malus, that is, deceit to be, when one thing is Cic. de offic. 3.
pretended, another acted; this is a false action. So, in like manner a false
diction, which is, a lie, must needs be when one thing is spoken by the mouth,
another understood in the heart: therefore the ordinary Grammatical notation
of this word mentiri, to lie, is quasi contra mentemire, as it were to go
against the mind: and Aristotle says, that speech is ordained Arist. de
interpr.
for this cause, to signify and express the secret conceptions of the mind:
therefore when the mouth and the mind are at variance, then the law of nature is
perverted, and in stead of a natural and true-borne child Truth, a bastard,
to wit, a lie is produced: But they which equivocate, pretend one thing, and
intend another; they speak one thing, and mean another; their heart and their
tongue, like untuned strings, are at jar with themselves, and therefore by no
means can they be excused from open and notorious lying.

8. Now, if an oath be mixed, then a fouler monster is Toll. de Sept. peccat.
cap. 54.
brought forth, even Perjury; for what is perjury, but according to their own
divinity, a lie made in an oath? and is not equiuocating, when the equiuocator
is sworn to speak the truth, perjury? Let Tully determine this doubt, if it
be a doubt, Not to swear a falsehood, is to be forsworn, but not to Cic. de
offic. 3.
perform or make good that which thou have sworn according to thine own
meaning, as customably it is conceived by thy words, is perjury: all the world
cannot more directly cut the throat of all equivocation then this does.

9. But I leave the Philosophers, and come to their own Schoolmen. To lie
(says Lumbard) is when a man speaks Lum. l. 3. did. 38
any thing contrary to that which he thinks in his mind. It is a lie (says
Aquinas) when a man will signify another thing, then Aqui. 2. 2. q. 111. art.
1. Lum. l. 3. did. 39
that which he thinks in his mind. Again, Lumbard. Whosocuer uses craft or
subtlety in an oath, defiles his conscience with a double guilt, for he both
takes the name of God in vain, and also deceives his neighbor. And Aquinas,
their great Doctor, condemns in express words this equiuocating trick of
theirs: If a Judge (says he) shall require any thing which he Aqui. 2. 2. 4.
69. art. 1.
cannot by order of law, the party accused, (what, may he equivocate?) No. he
is not bound to answer (in deed) but either by appeal, or some other means,
may deliver himself; but in no case may be tell a lie, or use falsehood, or any
kind of craft or deceit. This was then good divinity: but now the Jesuits, our
pretended resiners of Popery, have coined a new kind of divinity; but like
counterset slips, it will not abide the trial. Hear what Scotus says,
another Schooleman, Dicere non feci, Scotus lib. 5. de inst. q. 6. art. 2.
etc. To say I did not that, which I know I have done, although I speak it
with this reservation (that I may signify it to you) is not equivocation, but
a plain lie. To conclude with Maldonate, Mald. Com. in Luc. vl^. v. 28.
Quisquis fingendo, etc. Whosoever (says he) by saining does go about to
deceive another, although he intend some other thing in his mind, without
doubt, lies; for otherwise there would be no lie, which might not by this
means be defended.

10. Thus we have the verdict of diverse of their own Writers, touching this
monstrous doctrine. Let us hear now what the Fathers think of it, and let
Saint Hierome speak first: None is a liar (says he) but he that thinks
otherwise then Hieron. in 1. ad Corinth. ca. 4.
he speaks. Therefore the equiuocator is a liar, for he thinks otherwise
then he speaks: as when he affirms ( I am no Priest) when he is one, he
thinks he is that which he says he is not. Is Saint Augustine of a contrary
mind? no, he agrees with Hierome in this, though they iarred in some other
things. He that speaks (says he) falsely against his conscience, Aug. li.
contramend. cap. 5.
does properly lie, but so does our equiuocator. And for Perjury, This (says
Augustine) is the very form of Perjury, Idem Sermon. 28. de verbis Aposl.
to think that to be false which thou do swear. Thus does the equiuocatour,
for when he swears he knows not a man, and yet knows him, does he not
manifestly think that to be false which he swears? his mental reservation
cannot save him from the pillory; seeing, as Isidore says, God Isi lor. de
summo bono. li. 1. ca. 13.
does value an oath not by the sense of the speaker, but according to the sense
of him to whom the oath was made. Thus by the verdict of these three Fathers,
their doctrine of equivocation is guilty both of lying and perjury.

11. And that I may leave them without a starting hole, let them hear what the
Jury of Life and Death says, I mean the holy Prophets and Apostles, yea, what
GOD the Judge himself says. Thou shall not (says he) Bear false witness
against thy Neighbor: No, nor of thy neighbor: therefore much less against
thy self, or of thy self: but the equiuocatour does both: first, against his
Neighbonr, when by a false suggestion he persuades him to believe an untruth;
and of his neighbor, when he reports that of him which is untrue: and
secondly, of, and against himself, by confessing himself to be that which he
is not, or denying himself to be that which he is. Equivocation then is a
plain breach of this Commandment, and therefore a lie at the least. The
Prophet Jeremy interpreting this precept, as the manner of the Prophets was,
gives it affirmatively thus, Thou shall swear in Ierem. 4. 1. Psalm. 15.
truth, etc. And the Prophet David says, that the righteous man speaks in
truth. Now, what is it to swear or speak in truth, Azorius the Jesuit will
tell us, that It is either for the confirmation Azor. li. 11. mor, cap. 2.
of a truth, or in a probable opinion of that to be true which we swear or
speak. But the equiuocatours speech or oath is neither for the truth, nor from
the truth, and therefore a lie, if not gross perjury. Again, the Prophet
David sets down this as one note of a righteous man, that he speaks the truth
Psalm. 15. ^.
from his heart: but the Equiuocatour either speaks not the truth at all, or
at least speaks not from the heart, whereby he is evidently convinced to be
none of those that shall dwell in Gods Tabernacle, or asend into his holy
Mountain. Lastly, when as Saint Paul was taxed by some false brethren to be
carnally minded, because promising to come to Corinthus, he came not, does he
excuse himself by equivocation, saying, that he promised one thing and minded
another? no, but he protests that he was minded as he spoke, and that his 2.
Cor. 1. 13.
word was not yea, and nay, but simply yea: which proves, first, that all our
speech must be simple and plain, without equivocation: and secondly, that such
as abuse their speech in such sort, are fleshly minded men, full of lightness
and vanity. And thus we have a full verdict of Philosophers, Popish divines,
Fathers, and Scriptures: and therefore why may not sentence be pronounced, and
the equiuocator adjudged guilty both of lying and perjury, two sins which the
law of God, of Nature, and Men, have always condemned?

12. Again, what more contrary to the law of God and 4.
man, then adultery and fornication? But the religion of the Church of Rome
does directly maintain and allow both these, by tolerating Stews, places of
common whoredom, and open and known Strumpets prostituted to filthiness, and
that not only in all other places of the Popes Dominion, but even in Rome,
under his Holinesses own nose, and by his authentical approbation; neither can
this be imputed unto them as a corruption in manners only, and not as an
error in doctrine: for they not only uphold these places and persons of
infamy by their practice, and wink at them by neglect of due execution of
justice, but they are grown to that impudency, that they allow, maintain, and
approve them by their doctrine, as things necessary and commodious in a Common
wealth: and albeit they condemn them generally as sins, yet they approve
them again as necessary and profitable: as if there were any necessary profit,
or profitable necessity of sins, which Saint Paul calls the unfruitful
works of darkness, Ephesians. 5. 11. And thus with their own mouths they
condemn themselves in that which they allow, being Judges of Rom 14. 22.
themselves, and proclaimers of their own shame.

13. Their doctrine is this, that a lesser evil is to be permitted, to the
end that a greater may be avoided, and therefore brothel houses to be suffered,
lest all places should be filled with filthy lusts: and this their position
they defend; first, by the testimony of Saint Augustine in his Book De
Ordine; secondly, by deprauing and corrupting that place of Scripture, where it
is forbidden that there should be any Deuteronomy. 23. 17.
harlot in Israel; thirdly, by diverse reasons, to wit, if harlots were suffered
to be free and at liberty, without these Stews, they would sin more
licenciously, and that by their first restraint to that one place, they may be
made ashamed, and so at length converted, and that known harlots are to be
tolerated, lest violence should be offered unto honest Matrons; and lastly,
they are not ashamed to reckon whoredom and fornication amongst those things
which of their own nature are not evil, because the Apostles place it among
things of that Acts 15. 20.
nature, to wit, blood, things strangled, and things dedicated unto Idols.
These be their goodly reasons whereby they maintain Stews; but no marvel
if they maintain them, seeing their holy Father the Pope is in some sort
maintained by them. The Romish harlots pay (says Agrippa) unto the Pope
Agrippa de vanit. cap. 64.
every wecke a July (which is a certain kind of Coin) for their liberty, they
profane Gods word by a filthy Comment: for take away (say they) harlots out of
the Commonwealth, and all places will abound with whoredoms: whereas,
nevertheless the Commonwealths of Israel endured long without that stain,
where notwithstanding an harlot was not permitted. It is recorded also, that
the harlots in Rome pay unto the Pope a yearly pension, which amounts
sometimes to thirty thousand, sometimes to forty thousand Ducats. Pope Paulus
the third is said to have had in his Tables the names of 45000. Curtezans,
which paid a monthly tribute unto him. And therefore not without great cause
(if gain may be a sufficient cause) did Pope Sixtus build a noble or famous
Stews at Rome, as Agrippa Agrip. ibid. nobile lupanar Romae.
witnesses: for, seeing such large revenues arise to the holy Fathers purse,
by the means of strumpets, why should they not be there maintained? where, not
as Saint Paul says, godliness is gain, but gain is godliness, and all
Religion is turned into lucre, as Mantuan a Friar Carmelite of their own says,

Ven alia nobis Mant. lib. 3.

Templa, sacerdotes, altaria, sacra, coronae,
Ignis, thura, preces, coelum est venal^^, Deusque.
With us are all things to be bought and sold,
Priests, Altars, Temples, Sacraments new and old,
Crowns, Incense, Prayers, yea, Heaven and God for gold.
Add to these Whoredom, Sodomitry, and Incest, and all manner of sin, and
then there is a full square number. But I would feign know how these holy
Fathers can free themselves from the name and imputation of notorious bawdes;
seeing he is by all law esteemed a bawd, that maintains harlots, exposing
them to the lust of others for gain, then which, what can be more vilde and
base?

14. As touching the testimony of Saint Augustine, and their other reasons, I
answer in a word; first, that when Saint Augustine wrote that Book, he was
but Catecheumenus, a nouice in Religion, not well instructed in Christ's
School: and besides that, it does cross the doctrine both of himself in
other Books of more mature judgment, and also of the holy Scripture; for he
himself affirms elsewhere, that the good which comes of evil as a
recompense, must not be admitted, and the Scripture condemns to hell all
those (mark, you Romanists) that say, Let us do evil, that good may come
thereof, Romans 3. 8.
whose damnation is just.

15. Their other reasons are vain and idle: for what greater liberty can they
desire, then to be authorized by the head of the Church, who cannot err as
they teach, and to follow their filthy lusts by letters Patents from his
vnholynesse? (for so here it justly deserves to be tituled.) And is this the
way to reclaim and convert them from their filthiness, to dwell in gorgious
houses, to ride openly in goodly chariots, to be apparelled like Princes, to
have atte^ding on them men clad in brave attire, with chains of gold and
costly ornaments, yea, to be maintained by the Pope, and often visited by his
Holiness and his great Cardinals? if this be the way to reclaim them, let all
men of sound sense and reason judge indifferently.

16. Lastly, whether it be a means to stop the course of lust, and to
refrain whoredoms from spreading far and wide: let us against Augustine
oppose Saint Basil, Basil. commen. in Psalm.
who expounding these words of the Psalm: And has not sit in the chair of
pestilence, says, That whoredom stays not it self in one man, but inuadeth
a whole City: for some one coming to an harlot, takes to himself a fellow,
and the same also seekth another fellow: and so, as a fire being kindled in a
City, stays not in the burning one house or two, but spreads far and
wide, and draws a great destruction with it: so this mischief being once
kindled, rangeth over all the City. Oppose also to him Saint Ambrose, who
writing Ambr. omment in Psalm. 119.
upon the 119. Psalm, thus says; Who can nourish burning ^^ales in his
bosom, and not be burnt with them? So how can harlots be nourished in a
City, and young men not be corrupted with wheredome? Yea, oppose Tertullian
also, who Tertul. de anim^
affirms plainly, That all Brothel-houses are detestable before God. And
lastly, Justinian the Emperor, who in his Justin. Authent. tit. de Lenouth.
Authentikes, in the Title De Lenonibus, wills that harlots should be
utterly banished out of the City: and sorroweth, because he saw
Brothel-houses so nigh unto the Churches of God. And indeed, if it were true,
that it is a mean to restrain whoredom, why is it not then restrained at
Rome, by that means? I am sure they have their Stews: And yet Mantuan
doubts not to affirm, that for all their Stews confined into one place,
Vrbs estiam tota lupanar: The whole City was become a Stews. To conclude all
in one brief Sylogisme, That Religion which is contrary to the Religion of
God, cannot be of God, but of the Devil; but the Romish Religion in this one
point is contrary to the Religion of God; for the Scripture says, There shall
be no whore Deuteronomy. 23. 17.
in Israel; the Romanists say, There must be whores in Israel, that is, in the
Church, for the avoiding of a further mischief (then which what can be more
contradictorie?) therefore the Romish religion cannot be of God, but of the
devil, I mean, in those points wherein it thus crosses the truth of God.

17. But do they stay at adultery and simple fornication? 5.
No, their religion maintains open and notorious incest, and such as the
better sort of the heathen abominated; and this they do by three doctrines:
first, by that which gives allowance, at least wise toleration to common
Stews and brothel-houses, for the avoiding of a further mischief, as I have
declared in the former Section: for Stews cannot be tolerated, but incest also
needs must not only be occasioned, but even after a sort approved; the reason
is, because often it comes to pass, that the Father and the Son, or two
brethren and near kindred are defiled with one and the same woman, and so
unnatural and horrible incest, prohibited by the laws of God and man, is
committed. And albeit, oftentimes this is a thing secret and unknown unto them:
yet it does not wash their consciences from the guilt of this foul crime,
because they are bound to know in what degree she is unto them, of whom they
dare presume to have carnal knowledge. And besides, the act it self being
merely unlawful, does take away all excuse; together, with a secret suspicion
they should have, if they be not wilfully ignorant, that such a thing might be.
For if that rule of Saint Augustine be August. de ciuit. lib. 15.
good, Vitandum est licitum propter vicinitatem illiciti: that which is lawful
is often to be avoided, for the contiguity and neerenesse it has with that
which is unlawful: how much more is this true, that a thing unlawful in it
own nature is to be prohibited and avoided, not only because it is unlawful;
but much more if it bring with it apparent fear of a greater mischief? Now
that affinity is contracted, and therefore incest committed, not only by
lawful marriage, but also by unlawful copulation: I think no man doubts,
seeing that Saint Paul plainly affirms, That he which cleaves to an ^ Cor.
6. ^6.
harlot, is made one flesh with her. And their own law says, that it skils
not whether the kindred descends from the lawful Digest. lot derit. ^up^.
leg. 54.
marriages, or otherwise.

18. Their second doctrine maintaining Incest, is their opinion touching the
Popes power in dispensations: for they hold, that he being Christ's Vicar on
earth, may dispense in degrees expressly prohibited by Gods law, and so has and
Occasio L^cri.
does, if occasion be offered: by virtue of this dissipation, (so it may better
be termed with Saint Bernard, then dispensation) the King of Spain, and
Charles the Arch. Duke of Austria, married each of them their sisters
daughters. And Petrus Aluaradus married two sisters at once, and such like, as
you may see more at large in the former demonstration. What is this, I pray
you, but to allow and authorize incest? when as they ascribe unto their holy
Father the Pope authority to dispense with it: for according to the old rule in
Logike, Causa causae, est causa causati, which is, the cause of the cause, must
needs be also the cause of the effect: when as their doctrine therefore
vpholds the Popes power to dispense, and this power to dispense, brings forth
Incest, a bastardly brat; by conseque^t their doctrine must necessarily stand
guilty ^f being the first moouer thereof.

19. The third doctrine by which this soul sin is authorized, is the
general opinion of the Church, touching the extent of degrees of Consanguinity
prohibited in marriage: for, albeit in former ages it was forbidden to marry
within the seventh degree: yet in the Council of Laterane, Council. Later. cap.
10.
that Pontifical constitution was abrogated and the prohibition of marriage
restrained to the fourth degree inclusiuely: so, that beyond the fourth degree
it might be lawful for any to marry without exception. Which constitution is
at this day held for Authentical, and is of force in the Roman Church: now
this does give manifest allowance unto Incest. for whether the supputation be
made after the rule of the Civil law by generations, or of the Canon law by
persons: yet so ^e cases cannot be cleared from Incest; for this is the rule of
supputation by the Canon law, which is most favorable to them; Quo gradu
remotior distat a communi stipite, eodem etiam inter se distant. In what degree
the person furth^st removed is distant from the stock^, in the same degree they
are distant from one another. Now put the case after this manner.

ABRAHAM. ISAAC. JACOB. IVDA. PHARES. ISCAH. ISMAEL.

Here in this Scheme or figure, Iscah is by their own rule in the first degree
from ISMAEL: and therefore by their doctrine, ISMAEL may marry ISCAH, which is
most notable and apparent Incest: for brethren and sisters are but one flesh;
and so Isaac and Ismael are both one flesh; as Judah said of Joseph, Frater
noster est. caro nostra est: he is our brother and our flesh* And therefore
Ismael is unto all Isaacs posterity as it were their Father; and they unto him
in stead of Children: and so by consequent cannot marry, not only within the
fourth degree, but even unto the thousand degree, if it were possi^le. For
Adam, if he were now alive, could not find a woman in the whole world to marry
lawfully withal, without committing Incest: neither is this a conceit of our
own devising, but the express rule of the word of God: for Leuit. 18. 12. 13.
we are forbidden to uncover the shame of our Fathers sister, or of our Mothers
sister: but all our predecessors in the right line are our fathers and
mothers, though they he never so sarre removed; and therefore to marry with
their brothers or sisters, stands guilty of Incest by (...) law. For which
cause also Justinian decrees, (...) 1. (...)t. ^it. 10.
that Amitam licet adoptiuam, etc. It is not lawful to marry our Fathers
adopted sister, nor our Mothers adopted sister, because they are held in place
of Parents: and the law in the Digests Digest. deritu ^^^^. Leg. 17.
is plain and pertinent. Amitam quoque and materteram item magnam amitam. and
materter am magnam, prohibemur vxorem ducere, quamisis amita magna, and
ma^^rter a magna quarto gradit sunt. We are forbidden to warry our Auxt either
by Father or Mothers side: yea, our great Aunt, though she be in the fourth
degree. Thus by all ^awes the Popish doctrine, that it is lawful for any to
marry beyond the fourth degree, is a plain maintenance and allowance of Incest.

20. Again, who knows not but that theft is condemned by all laws, except
it be by the laws of Platoes imaginaries Commonwealth, or the Anabaptistical
positions of some later heretics, who would have propriety of goods taken
away, and a community of all things brought up? but the Papists by their
doctrine not only tolerate some kind of theft, but even maintain and allow
it as lawful: For, thus writes Maldonate a learned Jesuit, and of great
authority; Poor Mald. in Sum. q. 8. art. 3.
men (says he) do not commit theft, when being pressed with extreme
necessity, they take that which is another man's; because (mark his
Anabaptisticall reason) the thing at such a time is not properly another man's,
but common to the life of man being in danger, etc. And to prove this, he
abuses an excellent sentence of Saint Ambrose, who speaking of the community
Ambrose.
of charity, and not of propriety, says, Esurientis pauis est, quem ^^
retines; nudorum vestimen^u^ est, quod ^^ recludis; miserorum paecunia est,
quam tu in terram defodis. It is the poores bread which thou retainest, his
garment which thou lockest up, and his money which thou hy dest in the ground.
But he speaks, as any man may see, not to encourage the poor to lay hands
upon rich men's substance, but to stir up the rich to the works of charity:
neither to excuse a poor man from theft, if he steal from the rich, but to
accuse the rich of theft, if out of his wealth he do not power forth to the
necessity of the poor. Neither is this the opinion of one Jesuit only, but
it is backed and barred by the approbation of another of no mean credit: For
thus writes Emanuel Sa: in his Aphorisines. Eman. Sa. aph. page ^66.
Ego, inquit, etc. I (says he) am of the same mind with them, which think
that it is lawful for a poor man privily to purloine from a richman, which is
bound to help him and does not. Here be two brethren in evil, concurring in
the defense of one and the same sin; for if to steal, be not an offense for
a poor man, why does the law say in general, Thou shall not steal? Let them
show the exception and exemption of the poor from the law; or let them
confess to their eternal shame, that they are maintainers of those that
break Gods law. Besides, if (as Saint Augustine, and all other learned Divines
confess) it be not lawful to lie, though it be to the saving of our August.
de mendac. ca. 13.
lives: then it must needs follow, that it is not lawful for a poor man to
steal, though it be for the saving of his life: for theft is a sin that
brings more damage with it, then an officious lie can do, which is uttered
not for hurt of another, but for the preservation of our selves.

21. Besides these, Cardinal Tollet another Jesuit, a man of high dignity and
authority in the Roman Church, approves by his verdict another kind of theft,
worse then those before specified; for he allows in some cases the use of
false balances, and falsification of wares, his words are these. There Toll.
desept. pec. ^a. 49. pa. 744.
is (says he) a man that either by reason of unjust dealing of the Magistrate,
or the malice of the buiers conspiring together to pull down the price, or
some other reasonable cause, cannot sell his wine at a just price: when the
case thus falls out, then may this man either less^n his measure, or mingle
water with his wines, and so sell it for pure wine, and require the full price,
as if the measure were complete: provided that he do not lie, which
nevertheless if he do, it is no pernicious lie, nor mortal, nor binding to
restitution. In like manner, it is lawful to sell other silk in stead of
Granado silk, and Italian in stead of Greek: and so after the same proportion
all other wares. These be the brave positions of that renowned Cardinal:
wherein how apparently he does contradict the written word of God, let any
indifferent vmpier judge, by comparing this his doctrine with these sentences
of the Scripture here ensuing. Diverse weights are an Prou. 20. 2^.
abomination to the Lord, and deceitful balances are not good. A true weight
and a balance are of the Lord, and all the weights of Prou. 16. 11.
the bag are his work. Diverse weights and diverse measures, both Prou. 20.
20. Leu. 19. 35. 36.
these are even abomination to the Lord: ye shall not do unjustly in
judgment, in line, in weight, or in measure; ye shall have just balances,
true weights, a true Ephah, and a true Hin. I am the Lord your God, etc. Thou
shall not have in thy bag two manner Deuteronomy 25. 13. 14 15.
of weights, a great, and a small; neither shall thou have in thy house diverse
measures, a great, and a small; but thou shall have a right and a just weight,
a perfect and a just measure. Let no man oppress or defraude his brother in
any matter. How 1. These. 4. 5.
contradictory these plain precepts and enunciatiue propositions of Gods word,
are unto the positions of the Cardinal, no man can but discern that is not
bewitched with the so^cerie of Iezabel: either therefore let him show out of
holy writ some exception from these general rules, or let him acknowledge his
Doctrine and Religion, to be the vpholder of most gross and palpable theft.

22. If any man say that these be the opinions of private men, and not the
doctrine of the Church: I answer, that this is a most frivolous conceit, for
none of their books are admitted to the press, before they be examined by
certain Censurers deputed to that purpose by the Church: and if any thing
dislike them or seem to savor of heresy (as they call the truth) presently
it is either gelded out, or corrected at their pleasures. And that which goes
for current, has his allowance subnexed. That it contains in it nothing
contrary to the Catholic faith of the Church of Rome. These positions then of
these Jesuits standing thus approved by the common consent of their Censurers,
and privileged to be both printed and read of all men, as containing nothing
contrary to wholesome doctrine, cannot be thought to be the unadvised opinions
of priuatemen, but even the doctrine and religion of their Church.

23. Lastly, that I may conclude this second argument, 7.
they maintain also the profanation of the Sabbath, which the Lord has
enjoined to be sanctified with so great and urgent a precept: Remember that
thou keep holy the Sabbath day. Adding ^ m^men^o before, and fencing it with
so many reasons after, that it might not seem a light matter, but a
commandment of great consequence; yet these impudent preuaricators make it a
matter of no moment, yea, give liberty to the open breach and transgression of
it. For thus writes Cardinal Tollet. Homo tenetur, etc. A man (says he) is
bound Tollet. lib. 4. Instruct. 5. acc^t. 9. c. 24.
upon pain of a mortal sin to sanctify the Sabbath, but is not bound under
the same pain to sanctify it well. As if forsooth it could be sanctified at
all, if it be not well sanctified: or as if the profanation of the Sabbath
were the sanctifying of it: for not to sanctify it well, is nothing else but
to profane it: howbeit, if this were all the injury he does to Gods Sabbath,
it might be borne withal: but the bold Cardinal takes upon him to break in
pieces the bars thereof, and to expose it being the Lords day, and therefore
fit to be employed only in the Lords work, to most vile and base offices;
for thus he writes in the same book. Licet iter facere, etc. It is lawful
to take a journey on the feast day: (with this caveat, that divine service be
first heard.) It is lawful to hunt, and do such like things. It is lawful
for Judges, especially rural, to give judgment on the feast day: it is no
sin for a Barber to exercise his trade on the feast day for commodity, if he
had no leisure to do it at another time: they are excused also which sell
flesh, kill beasts, and sell necessary victuals on holy days: And if the
occasion of a great gain would otherwise be lost, as in fishing for Herring
and Tons, which come not but upon certain days, it is lawful to fish on
the holy day. In public solemnities it is lawful to prepare the ways, and
to build for spectacles. This is the doctrine of that renowned Cardinal, whose
writings are so approved of the Church of Rome, that whatsoever he speaks,
is held for truth. But here it may be answered, that he names not the
Sabbath, but the festival or holy day: to which I answer: First, that the
title of that Chapter is de Sabbath^: and therefore if he means not that, he
swarueth from his purpose. Secondly, that the express words and drift of the
whole Chapter demonstrates, that under the name of the festival or holy day,
he includes also the Sabbath. And thirdly, how could he give instructions
touching the cases of the Sabbath, if he intended not the Sabbath, seeing all
his rules run under this general term, on the festival or holy day? This
therefore is but a mist to blind men's eyes, that they might not see their
impiety.

24. Can this Religion (think you) be of God, which in thus many points
crosses and trampleth under foot the law of God? Does not the head of that
congregation evidently show himself to be (...), that outlaw, which S. Paul
speaks of, 2 Thessalonians. 2. that is, such an one as opposes himself to the law
of God? Do not the neck and shoulder which are supporters of that head, I
mean, the Cardinals and Bishops, show themselves to be of the same nature and
disposition with it? and the whole body, which is quickened by the life of his
doctrine, to be merely Antichristian? He that sees not this, is blind, and
cannot discern a far off; he that sees it and confesses it not, is
careless of his own salvation. Let us leave them therefore, either to be
converted, which God grant for Christ his sake, or to be confounded, if they
continue in their errors.

MOTIVE. III. That Religion which imitateth the Jews in those things wherein
they are enemies to Christ, cannot be the truth: but such is the Religion of
the Church of Rome. Ergo.
THe malice of the Jews toward Christ our Savior, and MAYOR.
his Church, from the beginning unto this day, is so notorious, that the whole
world is witness thereof. Saint Paul witnesses of them, that they killed the
Lord Jesus, and their 1. These. 2. 15. 16
own Prophets, and persecuted the Apostles, and were contrary to all men, and
forbad them to preach unto the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fulfill
their sins always, and that the wrath of God was come upon them to the
uttermost. And as it was at that time, so ever since they have not any whit
remitted, but increased in their rancour; for still they crucify unto
themselves the Lord of Life, though not in his person which is at the right
hand of God; yet in his members who^ they persecute unto death as much as in
them lies, and in his Gospel, which they still pursue with a deadly hatred.
Yea, so great is their malice, that many times they have taken Christian
children, upon their preparation day to the Passover, and nailed them upon the
Cross, loaded them with reproaches and scorns, in disgrace of Christ, and
miserably tormented them to death; as was done by the Jews of Inmester, a
Town situate betwixt Socrat. Hist. lib. 7. cap. 16.
Chalchis and Antiochia, as witnesses Socrates in his Ecclesiastical History;
and in Germany, at Fretulium; as Jo. Finc. li. 3. Flores Histor.
also in England, at Lincoln and Norwich, as our Chronicles testify. Yea, it
is recorded how the Jews of Hungary took a Carpenters Son that was a
Christian, in despi^^^^ of Christ, whom they esteemed no better then the Soon
of a Carpenter, and cut all the veins of his body, and sucked out his blood
with quils: and being apprehended, and tortured, they confessed that they could
not be without Christian blood, for therewithal they anointed their Priests.
Yea, they have often poisoned the springs, and by that means brought great
plagues upon Christian people; and set on fire Cities and Towns, to bring them
to poverty and misery. Can there be greater enemies to Christ then these are?
for the poisoned arrows of their malice are shut up against him, who is in
heaven beyond their reach, and therefore they fall down upon his members: but
the venom of them lights upon their own heads, to their eternal confusion.
Who would now imitate these wretches in any thing, especially in that wherein
the cause of their enmity consists? can they be of God that do this? or
rather are they not the brood of that Serpent, that has been ever a professed
enemy to the seed of the woman? This being so clear and manifest, I leave the
first proposition without any other guard or defense, and come to the
confirmation of the second, wherein the pith of the argument confisteth.

2. That the Religion of the Church of Rome is an apish MINOR.
imitation of Iudaisine, and that in those things wherein it is most opposite
to Christ, may appear, if we first consider wherein the opposition of the
Jewish Religion consists, and then secondly compare the Romish with the same.
The Jews Religion is opposite to Christ in two respects principally: first, in
retaining the old Ceremonies of Moses law, which Romans 10. 4. Heb. 10. 1.
were shadows of things to come, and had their accomplishment in Christ: for
that which Paul says concerning Circumcisiou, is to be understood of all other
Ceremonies: They which entangle themselves with that yoke of bondage, under
Gal. 4. 9. and 5 2. 4.
those impotent and beggarly rudiments, are abolished from Christ, and Christ
does profit them nothing: And secondly, in devising a multitude of strange and
new superstitions, coined in the mint of their Rabbinish conceits, contrary not
only to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but even to their own law, which
Deutorologies of theirs our Savior condemns, Math. 15. 3. 6. when he says,
that they transgressed the Commandment Matthew. 15. 3. 6.
of God, and made it of no effect by their own tradition. Both these ways
show they their enmity to Christ and Christian Religion, and are thereby
retained and encouraged in their errors.

3. Now compare the Romish Religion with these Rabbinisticall conceits in both
respects, and it will appear that one egg is not liker to another, nor milk
to milk, then the Romish and Jewish superstition are to each other. And
touching I.
the first, to begin with the multitude of their ceremonies: It is not unknown
to any that know any thing in the book of God, that the Church of the Jews
was laden with a heavy burden of ceremonies. S. Paul says, that it was so
heavy, Acts 15. 10.
that neither they nor their fathers were able to bear it, and therefore
calls the Ceremonial law, a yoke of bondage, and Gal. 5. 1. and 4. 31.
those that were under that yoke, children of the bondwoman, and not of the
free. And the reasons why God did impose upon them such a number of Ceremonies,
were just and holy, to wit: first, because the Church was then in the infancy,
and therefore needed to be under a Schoolmaster to instruct, Gal. 3. 24.
and as it were catechize it unto Christ, and therefore they were to be dealt
withal, as children use to be with the gilded leaves and fair pictures of
external rites, and to be fed with milk, being not able to digest strong
meats. Secondly, because by them they were, as it were by visible
representations informed, both touching some great benesit past and received,
and touching the Messiah to come and his Kingdom, as also concerning godly
conversation required in their own life: for in the bark of every legal
ceremony, these three vital spirits were contained. And thirdly (as it is
well observed by S. Chrysostom) in regard of their infirmity Chrysostom.
and weakness, who being lately come out of Egypt, and there defiled
themselves with idolatry and superstition, necessarily required sacrifices and
ceremonies to be allowed unto them, lest they should fall back again to their
Egyptian corruption: wherefore Almighty God (says he) so dealt with them, as a
Physician deals with his sick patient, who through the burning heat of his
disease, requires a cup of cold water, or else is ready to hang or kill
himself; there the Physician being constrained by necessity, commands a viole
of cold water prepared by himself, to be brought unto him, but withal warnes
him, that he drink not but out of that Viole. So God granted sacrifices and
ceremonies to the sickly Israelites, but so, that they should not use any, but
those which he appointed for them, and that after the manner by him
prescribed. And this to be so, he proves, because the law of ceremonies was
not given, until the children of Israel had defiled themselves with the golden
Calfe, for the making whereof they were so mad bent, as that they pulled off
their Jewels, eare-rings, and rings from their bodies, and gave them for the
framing of that Idol: and he illustrateth the same in another place by
another excellent similitude. If a man (says he) have a wife prone to
incontinencie, he shuts her up in certain places and chambers, setting
about her a guard of servants and attendants, to keep her from straying
abroad, and entertaining her lovers. So God dealt with the Church of the Jews,
which he had married to himself in compassion and love, seeing it prone to
Idolatry and superstition, he separated it from other Nations, and shut it up
within the bounds of the land of Canaan, and set about it a guard of Ceremonies
and external Rites, which should be as it were Tutors unto it, until it were
fully confirmed in faith and obedience. Thus far Chrysostom. By all which
we see not only, that the Church of the Jews was loaded with a bundle of
ceremonies, which were to endure till the coming of the Messiah: but also the
reasons why the Lord imposed that burden upon them.

4. Now is the Church of Rome any whit behind them in this? No verily, but
far before them: for if we shall compare Moses Leuiticus, with the Romish
Missals, we shall find, that in number of ceremonies they far exceed the
Synagogue of the Jews. The Jews had but two great Sacraments: the Church of
Rome have seven. The Jews but one ordinary Altar: the Church of Rome ten
thousand, even as many as Churches, and not only so, but often diverse Altars
in one Church. The Jews offered many sacrifices, but the Church of Rome
exceed them in the number of their Masses ten to one. The Jewish Holy Days
were few in comparison of the Romish, for they had but their Passover,
Pentecost, feast of Tabernacles, of Trumpets, reconciliation, new Moons, Purim
and dedication: but these have their Holy Days for every Saint, for the
Cross, Corpus Christi, All Saints, All Souls, and what not: insomuch that
their friend Erasmus complains, that in Ieromes age there were Eras. in Mat.
11.
few Holy Days besides the Lords day: but now, that there is neither end nor
measure in the multitude of them. The Jews observed a few fasting days by
Gods appointment, and others taken up by their own tradition, as the second
and fifth day of the week: but the Romish fasts exceed both in number and
superstition: for besides two days in every week, every Saints Eve almost is
a fasting day with them, besides their Lent fast continued whole six weeks
without intermission, if to abstain from flesh, and glut themselves with other
viands, as nutritive to the body, be to be termed a fast. The Jews Priesthood
was distinguished but into two maine orders, Priests and Levites, and these
later assigned to some few distinct offices about the Temple: but the Romish
Priesthood is pestered with a swarm of the several orders of Friars, Monks,
Anchorites, secular and regular Priests, that almost serve for nothing but to
consume the fruits of the earth. The holy garments for the Leuiticall
Priesthood, were but few in number in comparison of the Romish vestments: for
the high Priest of the Jews had but six garments appointed to him; the Ephod,
the breast plate, the Robe, the linen coat, the girdle, and the crown; and
for the inferior Priests, but four, linen coats, bonnets, linen breeches,
and girdles: but the Romish have six garments in token of perfection; and the
Bishops nine, because there are (as they say) Bonau. ratio. Diui. offic. li. 3.
c. 1.
nine orders of Angels; in all fifteen, answerable to the fifteen degrees of
virtues. What should I reckon up their manifold crossings, kissings, kneelings,
whisperings, washings, anoyntings, spittings, breathings, saltings, with an
infinite number besides of vain and strange observations which are used in
their Church, which the Jewish Synagogue may not compare withal, either for
multitude or strangeness? And thus they are not only equal to them, but
far exceed them in the number of their Ceremonies. And this is even Agrip. de
vanit. cap. 60.
confessed by many of their favorites: for Cornelius Agrippa says, that
Christians are now more oppressed with ceremonies, then the Jews were in
former times. And Polydore Virgsll, that Polyd. Virgil de invent l^. 4. in
prooemi^.
a very wood of Jewish and heathenis^ ceremonies pestered the Lords field. Yea,
Saint Augustine complains of the same superstition in his time, when
Antichristianisme was but in breeding, when he says, that the Church was
pressed contrary Aug. Epist. 119. cap. 19.
to Christ's merciful institution, with such a servile burden of Ceremonies,
that the state of the Jews under the law was m^re tolerable then the condition
of Christians, seeing they were subject only to Gods ordinances, and not to
humane presumptions as Christians are. But if he had lived at this time, and
seen the fruitful multiplication of them, in respect of his age, how would
he have complained? And thus in respect of multitude of Ceremonies, the Romish
Church is by many degrees before the Church of the Jews.

5. To descend to particulars. The Jews had their sacrificing Priests, whereof
one was their chief Priest, and the other of an inferior rank. The
Romanists, in an apish imitation, have their sacrificing Priests too, the Pope
their chief, and the vnder-shauelings his vassals: as if Aaron was a type of
the Pope, and not of Christ; or as if all Christians were Heb. 8. 6. and 9. 6.
11. 12. 1. Pet. 2. ^.
not Priests under the Gospel; both which are evident in the new Testament:
but we no where find that the high Priest of Jerusalem was a type of the high
Priest of Rome, or that the Revel. 1. 6.
Ministers of the Gospel are sacrificing Priests. This latter is Bell. de cultu
sanctor. lib. 3. ca. 4.
confessed by Bellarmine, who says that the Christians of the Primitive Church
did purposely abstain from the names of Temple and Priesthood, until the
days of Tertullian, lest that they should seem to have retained some Jewish
Ceremonies. Why then do they now entertain those names, whereof the purer
times were ashamed? do they not show thereby that they are degenerated from
that primer purity, which they so much brag of? And yet we do not dislike
the name of Priest, if it be rightly taken, for such an one as ministers in
holy things betwixt God and the people, but that the Ministers of the Gospel
should be sacrificing Priests, is Jewish; as also, that the man of Rome should
be the Archpriest on earth, whereas we have but one high Priest, even Christ
our Savior, who having once offered himself a sacrifice for sin, sits
for ever at the right hand of God. And that we may plainly see that in their
Hierarchy they imitate the Jews, Bellarmine is a sufficient witness, who to
prove that there ought to be a visible Monarch in the Church, alleges that
Aaron was not only Bell de Roman. Pontif. li. 1. ca. 9.
a type of Christ, but also of the Pope, because the sacrifices of the law did
not only represent the bloody sacrifice of the Cross, but also the unbloody
sacrifice of the Mass. Which if it be true, then there can be but one high
Priest in the Church of Christ, as there was but one in the Church of the
Jews: for the argument will stand thus in good mood and form, being built
upon their own ground. As the Church of the old Testament was governed, so
ought the Church of the new: but the old was governed by one only high Priest;
therefore the new ought also to have but one only: for either he must show
that there were two high Priests in the Church of the Jews, one subordinate
unto the other, or convicted by his own principle, he must acknowledge that
there ought not to be two in the Church of Christ, or at least confess that
this argument is lame, drawn from the imitation of the Jewish Hierachy: and
then if it be not true which he affirms, what will be the sequel thereof, but
either ignorance in symbolizing those things which are no wise matches, or
impiety in dethroning Christ from his office, and setting the Diadem upon the
Popes head; and so, that in their Romish Hierarchy they are the Jews Apes, in
that thing which most tends to the dishonor of Christ.

6. As they imitate the Jewish Priesthood, so do they also their Altar and
sacrifices: for they are not content with the name of the Lords Table, which
name was used both by the 1. Cor. 10. 21. Arnob. cont. genesis lib. 6. Cyril.
Alex. cont. Julian, l. 10. Chrysostom. in Psa. 95.
Apostles and primitive Church. For which cause (as testifies Arnobius,
Cyrill, and Chrysostom) they were challenged by the Pagans of impiety, nor yet
to take the name of Altar and Sacrifice in an improper signification, as some
of the later Fathers did, calling the Lords Table an Altar, because on Aug.
cont. Faust. lib. 20. ca. 18. and li. 3. de bapt. c. 19
it was represented the sacrifice of the Cross, and the action in the
Eucharist a sacrifice, because it was a commemoratiue representation of that
sacrifice, as their writings plentifully testify; but they will have a very
Altar in proper phrase of speech, and a true real sacrifice, then which what
can be more Jewish? especially, seeing all such Altars were abolished by the
Cross of Christ; and there remains but one Altar in the Church, Whereof they
have no power to eat which serve the Tabernacle, Rco. 13. 10. Theodoret.
Oecumen. Aquinas. Glossa ordin. in lacum.
to wit, Christ, as all the Fathers expound the place, who is the only true
Altar and proper sacrifice of the new Testament: True Altar (I say) and proper
Sacrifice, because the soul of every just man is called by them a
metaphorical Altar, and their prayers, good works, almsdeeds, etc.
spiritual sacrifices. And therefore Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origin, and
Lactantius, writing against the Pagans, who objected that Christians had no
Altars nor sacrifices, and therefore no religion, answer, That a just and holy
soul is a right holy Altar, from which do arise prayers as sweet incense, and
upon which are offered up to God, justice, patience, faith, innocence,
chastity, and such other v^rtues. And these are the only Altars and Sacrifices
now upon earth; for our true Altar and sacrifice is in heaven.

7. Again, the Jews had lamps continually burning in the Tabernacle, and
afterward in the Temple, which were types of Christ, who is the true light of
the world, and of the Ioh. 1. 9. Matthew. 5. 14.
Apostles and Ministers of the Gospel, who by their doctrine and preaching
convey this light from Christ the fountain, as it were by Conduits and Pipes,
to the illuminating of the whole world: Qui^ in candelabro (says Gregory) nisi
Redemptor Gregor. in Ezech. ^^m. 6.
humani gener is designatur? Who is figured out by the candlestick, but the
Redeemer of mankind? Hastile candelabro (says venerable Bede) ipse qui est
caput Ecclesiae debet intelligi, By Beda.
the shaft of the Candlestick, must be understood, he that is the head of the
Church. And the six branches issuing out of the body of the Candlestick, what
are they but the Apostles and Pastors of the Church (says Marbachius) which
as Marbach.
branches issue from Christ, and make but one body with the shaft, to signify
that they must conspire in preaching Christ alone, and so united to each other
by the bond of Concord? Yet the Church of Rome retain also this ceremony: for
they have multitude of Lamps and Candles in their Churches burning in the day
time, as if they would declare to the world, that either they believe that
Christ is not yet come, or else that they have not the clear Sunshine of
the Gospel amongst them, but the dim Candlelight of superstition. Now that
this Jewish ceremony is used amongst them, not only experience shows in all
places, and their great solemn Candlemasle, upon the day of the purification
of the blessed Virgin: but also the decree of their own Popes, Gregory Gregor.
in Decret. Pl^tin. in Sabinian.
the first, and Sabinian his successor: the one of which appointed certain
Lands for the maintenance of Wax-candles and Lamps in Churches, and the other
ordained, Vt accensae Lampades perpetuo in Ecclesys retinerentur: That burning
Lamps should be always kept in their Churches. And that they Durand. in
Ratic. lib. 1. cap. 1.
fetch their pattern^ from the Jews, Durand plainly acknowledges, when he
says, That the Church is enlightened by Gods commandment. Whereupon it is read
in Exodus, Charge the children of Israel, that they offer pure oil of olive,
that the Lamps may burn continually in the Tabernacle. It is clear then, that
this is a Jewish imitation, at least, if they had not rather be counted to be
followers of the Gentiles, then of the Jews: amongst whom also this custom
was in use, to have lights and Lamps continually burning in their Idol
Temples: as witness both Tertullian, Lactantius, and Gregory Naezianzene,
Tertul. in Apr. ^a^. 35. Lactant. lib. 6. cap. 62. Nazianz. in Julian. Orat. 2.
1. Cor. 10. 20. Iud. 1. 6. 1. Ioh. 1. 5.
with diverse others. Lactantius says plainly, That they set up lights to their
God, as if he dwelt in darkness. And so they did, for their gods whom they
worshipped, were devils, who are reserved in the chains of darkness, unto the
Judgment of the great day. But our God dwells in light inaccessible, and he
is all light, and in him is no darkness: what need any light or Lamps be set
up before him then? If they say, that they have the example of the primitive
Church for their warrant. I answer, that it is true indeed, as may appear
out of all Ecclesiastical Histories, and the Epistles of Pliny the second, to
Traiane, that they had the use of Lamps in their assemblies: but this was in
their night-meetings, which they were constrained to use in the time of
persecution, not daring to assemble together by day: as is testified both by
Eusebius, ^useb. de vita Constant. lib. 4. Epiphan* aduers. haeres. sub finem.
Tertul. quo supra. Jerome. contra Vigilant. c. 3.
Epiphanius, Tertullian, etc. but never in the day time, till Ieromes age, when
this superstition began to grow upon the Church. So that this custom is either
Heathenish or Jewish, let them choose whether: both which are equally
disgraceful to the Church of Christ.

8. So likewise they fetch the use of their hallowed water from the Jews, if
not from the Pagans, for the Jews had Numb. 10.
their Holy Water made of the ashes of a red Cow, whereby were purged all
legal uncleannesses: so have the Romanists their Holy Water sprinkles, to
purge and cleanse away all the impurities of the soul. This is plain, not
only by their practice, but also by the decree falsely fathered upon Pope
Alexander the first: but indeed of some later Pope, which Deconsecrat. D. 3.
cap. aquam sale.
thus speaks: We bless water mingled with salt, that all being sprinkled
therewith, may be sanctified and purified, which we enjoin all Priests to
do: for if the ashes of a Cow being sprinkled, did sanctify and cleanse the
people of the Jews, then much more does water mixed with salt, and consecrated
by divine prayers, sanctify and cleanse Christian people. Which consequence how
vain and impious it is, who sees not? Vain, I say, for the Leuiticall
Holy Water did only cleanse from outward uncleannesses, but the Romish by their
doctrine does purge the soul from spiritual pollutions. Impious, for the
Scripture says, that it is the blood of Christ that purges us from all 1.
Ioh. 1. 7.
our sins, and not water mingled with salt: and it makes the comparison not
betwixt the ashes of an Heyser and Holywater, Heb. 9. 13. 14.
water, but betwixt it and the blood of Christ. This imitation then is both
vain and impious, if it be of the Jews: and more, if it be of the Gentiles:
for what agreement has the 2. Cor. 6. 16. Justin Martyr in Apolog. 1.
Temple of God with Idols? And yet so it is also: for Iustine Martyr tells
us, that the devils, when they heard out of the Prophets of the spiritual
washing that should be in the Kingdom of Christ, in an apish resemblance
caused his worshippers to purge themselves by the sprinkling of hallowed water.
And Theodoret, Theodoret hist. lib. 3. ^. 14. 15.
that Julian the Apostate commanded their bread, flesh, fruits, and all other
kind of victuals, to be purged (as he supposed) by holy water: and that
Valentinian his Tribune, who succeeded him in the Empire, when Fortunes Priest
sprinkled him with holy water, struck the Priest with his fist, saying, Thou
have not cleansed, but defiled me. Hipocrates also the Physician Hypocrates de
morb^ sacr^.
does witness the same, when he says, that entering into their Temples, they
were sprinkled, not that they might be defiled: but that if they had any sin,
they might be purged from it. Thus it plainly appears, that this was a
Heathenish custom; which how it can agree with the Church of Christ, I know
not; sure I am, that in the Primitive Church there was no holy water besides
the water of Baptism, that can be proved by any good authority; for the
testimonies of Alexander the ^el. de verbo Dei non scripto. lib. 4. cap. 3.
^useb. de spiritu Sancto. cap. 27. Eras. in Basil.
first, Clement and Basil alleged by Bellarmine, are all counterfeit, as
partly the matter in them contained, and partly the censure of Eusebius and
Erasmus do sufficiently prove, and might here be demonstrated, if I thought
it necessary: neither does it agree with the nature of those times, to the
which S. John so lately before had left this doctrine, that the only purgation
of sin was the blood of Christ; and not holy water consecrated by a Priest.

9. In like manner, their use of Incense on their Altars to drive away devils
(as they say) does savor both of Iudaisme and of Paganism. That the Jews
used to burn Incense in Polyd. Virgil, de Jnuent. li. 5. c. 1. Innocent. 3. de
offic. Miss. lib. 2. cap. 17. Exodus 30. 1. Psalm. 141. 2. Revel. 8. 2.
sacrifice to God, is no question, for they had their Altar of burnt Incense
appointed by God himself for that purpose: and this Altar (without question)
was a type of Christ our Mediator, and the incense of the prayers of the
Saints, which are then acceptable unto God, when they are offered up in the
name of Christ, who is the Altar that sanctifies all our sacrifices. This is
so evident, not only out of holy Scripture, but from the full consent of all
Writers old and new, that it is needles to stand to prove it. And therefore
offering of Incense being a shadow of things to come, why should it still
remain, seeing the Sun of righteousness is risen in our Horizon, and has
^ispelled all shadows by the glorious beams of his presence? As touching the
Pagans, Polydore Virgil confesses, that it was their custom to offer Incense
to their Idols. Polyd. Virgil de Invent. li. 5. c. 1. Theod. li. 3. c. 15. and
16.
And Theodoret affirms, that when Julian distributed gold amongst his
Soldiers, he commanded an Altar full of coals to be set by him, and
Frankincense to be laid on a Table, to the end that every one would recieue
gold at his hand, should first cast Frankincense upon the Altar: and this he
did to distinguish the Pagan from the Christian. By which it is evident (by the
way) that at that time this was not in use in the Church. This Jewish and
Paganish custom then, how comes it to pass, that it should now be taken up
as a holy service of God? Are not all Jewish Ceremonies at an end by the
coming of the body which is Christ? And is it fit that Christians should
learn to worship God from the Gentiles, which were worshippers of devils?
These things are so dissonant to the nature of true Religion, that they admit
Arnob. l. 6. and li. 7. page 226. Eusebius. in orat. ad Sancta. Coelum.
no just reconciliation. Sure it is, that the Primitive Church never knew the
use thereof, as appears both by that Example of Julian before alleged out of
Theodoret, and also by testimonies of Arnobius, Eusebius, and Augustine: all
which acknowledge that the Church in their time had no (...)n Psalm. 49. and 50.
such custom. We go^ ^into Arabia (says Saint Augustine) to fetch
Frankincense, God requires of us the sacrifice of praise. As for the ancient
Leiturgies and Dionisius, that mention it in Gods service, we care not for
them, seeing all men either vehemently suspect them, or utterly reject them as
counterfeit.

10. Again, the Jews had their holy oil wherewith their Kings, Priests, and
Prophets were anointed, which was a type and figure of that spiritual unction
of grace, wherewith Psalm. 45. 7. John 3. 34. 1. Ioh. 2 27.
Christ our head was anointed above his fellows, and all his members in a due
proportion. The Church of Rome has also revived this Ceremony, and that after
a far more superstitious manner: for there was not half such a stir at the
making of the holy oil of the Tabernacle, as there is at the consecrating of
their holy Chrisme: it would even provoke Gallas.
the spleen to laughter, and the gall to bitterness, to hear or behold the
apish tricks that they use at the making of their precious Chrisme: such
muttering, such charming and enchanting, such blowing and breathing, such
exorcising and coniuring the devil, by the mitted Bishop first, and then
twelve Priests in their order, before they come to Aue Sanctum Chrisma, All
hail O holy Chrisme, as is wonderful. What is this, I pray you, but a professed
restoring of a Jewish Ceremony, and a plain declaration that their Priests are
rather Jewish than Christian? and that those graces of Gods spirit, which were
figured by their holy oil, are not to be found in cheir Church, seeing they
retain so superstitiously the type thereof? If they say that Saint James
mentions oil to be used at the visitation of the sick, whereby they
recovered health: I answer, first, that this was no such consecrated oil as is
in use in the Church of Rome: and secondly, that it was applied only to the
sick that were in danger of death, not to young Infants that are new come into
the world, at their baptism: thirdly, that it was not an instrument of
spiritual grace, but of corporal health: and lastly, that it lasted only
during the time that miracles lived in the Church, and dyed when they dyed: so
that Saint James his oil makes nothing for the maintenance of the Romish
Chrisme: and therefore I leave it unto them as a mere Jewish superstition.

11. Lastly does not the high Priest of Rome imitate the high Priest of the
Jews in his Pontifical garments? are not their Friars and Anchorites ^p^sh
counterfeiters of the Leuiticall Nazarites? does not their Iubile both in name
and nature represent the Jewish Iubile? no man that knows the one, and sees
the other, but will confess this to be true: for Aaron wore a Crown upon his
head, to signify the Kingly power of Christ: the Bishop of Rome has three
Crowns, to signify (forsooth) his threefold power in Heaven, Earth, and
Purgatory. Or as Aretine iested, one for the flesh, another for the world, and
the third for the devil, and none for God. Aaron had a plate on his Crown,
wherein was engraven Holiness Auent.
to the Lord. The Bishop of Rome used to wear a plate on his head, wherein was
written the word Mystery, as if he would profess himself to be the vpholder
of that mystery of iniquity spoken of by the Apostle. Aaron had his Ephod 2.
These. 2. 7.
and Robe: the Bishop of Rome has answerable thereunto his rich Pontifical
attire, which in many resemblances is like unto the same: yea, the Romanists
do plainly Iudaize in bringing in again into the Priestly order such variety
of garments, as the Pall, the Miter, the Crozier-staffe, the Albe, the Chimere,
the gray Amice, the S^oale, with such like. Insomuch, that when their Bishops
come forth to do divine service, a man would think that he saw Aaron
addressed with his attire to sacrifice at the Altar.

12. As touching their Friars and Anchorites, how like are they to the
Nazarites of the Law: the Nazarites might not drink wine nor strong drink: no
more may diverse of the religious shauelings by the rules of their order. They
were tied by a vow which they might not break without sin: so are these at
their first entrance into their Cloisters and Cells; and that so strictly, that
they account it a greater sin to violate that vow of voluntary Religion, then
the vow that they have made to God in their baptism: and therefore they hold
it a less sin to commit fornication, which they have vowed against in
baptism; then to marry, which they made vow against when they took upon
them the religious order, as has been proved in the former reason. They
might not meddle with worldly affairs, during the time of their separation; no
more may some of these Romish votaries, they may not so much as handle money
(forsooth) with their bare hands; but with Gloves on, they will receive as much
as they can lay their clouches on: and even whilst they thus seem to contemn
riches, they spread their nets to draw whole Towns and Countries into their
possessions. Only in this the Nazarites and they differ: they were true
worshippers of God, and their order was Gods ordinance: these are monstrous
hypocrites, hidden under the cloak of Religion, neither are their orders of
God, but as Chaucer long ago sung, The devils excrements.

13. Lastly, for their Iubile ordained first by Boniface the eight, to be
every hundredth year, after brought down by Clement the sixth to every fifty
year: and after that by to every three and thirtith year; and lastly, by to
every five and twentieth year, where it rests. What is it but a renouation of
that Jewish ceremony, which was instituted by God, to signify that
everlasting happiness and joy, which was brought into the world by Christ our
Savior? The Trumpetters whereof were first the Prophets, as Esaias for example,
who in the person of Esaias 61. 1.
Christ proclaimed good tidings to the poor, healing to the broken hearted,
liberty to the Captives, and redemption to the Prisoners* the acceptable year
of the Lord, etc. Secondly, the Angels who professed, that they brought glad
tidings of great joy that should be to all people, at the birth of our Savior
Jesus Christ. And lastly the Apostles, who when they Luke 2. 10. 11.
began to preach the Gospel, proclaimed this great Iubile to all the world
that should believe in Christ, ^o continue not a year, but for ever and ever.
To imitate this ceremony then, what is it, but with the Jews to expect the
Messiah to come in the flesh, and to disclaim the glad tidings of the Gospel,
as a false message, deceiving the world? This is so Jewish a superstition, as
the very name, time, and use, declare that nothing can be more.

14. Thus we see, how in the imitation of the Leuiticall ceremonies, the
Church of Rome goes in equipage with the Synagogue of the Jews: from whence
may be deduced these two conclusions. First, that the light of the Gospel is
either utterly extinguished, or at least very dimly shining amongst them: for
it is a true rule, the more shadow, the less light; and the more light, the
less shadow: and therefore those Northern people called by the Philosophers
Amphisei^, because their shadow goes round about them in a circle, have the
Sun so far remote from them, that they are scarce refreshed with the beams
thereof: but they which have the Sun perpendicularly over them, are Ascij,
without shadow. And what is the night, but the dark shadow of the earth, and
the day, but the removing of that shadow by the coming of the Sun? The
Church of Rome then being thus enwrapped, and compassed about with the
superstitious shadows of Jewish ceremonies, plainly declares, that either the
Sun is not risen amongst them, or that it is very far off, even in the
skirts of their Horizon. Secondly, that their Church is not as they brag of
it, the only Catholic Church, but rather the whore of Babylon, for her attire
bewrays her condition: a chaste Matrone is attired decently, but not garishly,
but a strumpet like Iezabel, sets forth her self with garish deckings, and a
painted face to allure lovers unto her: the Romish congregation then being thus
adorned, not like a chaste Matrone, but like a light Harlot, with the garish
attire of Jewish ceremonies, all in pomp and ostentation, discovers her
self not to be the Spouse of Christ, but the strumpet of Antichrist. And so I
conclude the first part of this argument, that seeing one piece of the Jews
enmity to Christ, consists in retayning the Leuiticall ceremonies, which had
their accomplishment in Christ: therefore to imitate them in this respect, is a
plain demonstration, that their Religion is not from Christ, but from
Antichrist, his professed enemy.

15. The second point wherein they imitate the Jews, is far worse then the
former: for it is in their Rabbinish and Cabalisticall traditions, which as
they are most gross corruptions of the law, so are they the foulest enemies to
the Gospel of Jesus Christ that the world has. I will not stand to reckon up
the foolish and ridiculous niceties of the brainsick Rabbines, wherewith the
ignorant Jews are at this day besotted, and which are as a veyle over their
eyes, to hinder them from seeing the truth. I remit the Reader for these things

Paulus Fagius, Sixtus Senensis, and Galatinus: my task is to show, how the
Church of Rome imitateth them in many of these their absurd fancies, which will
prove their Religion to be little better then theirs.

16 First, the Jews hold, that Moses received two laws of God in mount Sinai;
the one written, and the other unwritten: this latter they call their Cabala,
and they say, that Moses by word of mouth commended it to Joshua, and Joshua to
the Elders of Israel, and they to the Prophets, and they again unto the
Masters of the great Synagogue under Esdras, from whom their wisemen called
Cachamim successively received it, and in this they glory, calling it the joy
of their hearts, and the refreshing of their bones. This unwritten Cabala, was
at the first preserved only in the hearts of their great Cachamim or learned
Masters, and delivered by them to the people by mouth only: afterward it began
by little and little to be commended to writing, and was at the first called
Mischua, that is, the law repeated, after the Thalmud of Jerusalem: and lastly,
the Thalmud of Babylon, which is the most sacred Scripture, by which the Jews
are governed and directed at this day, and which they prefer before the law
written: for the law written (say they) can neither be understood, nor
expounded without the help of this, neither is perfect, unless this be added
to it. Thus dote the Jews upon their Thalmud and Cabala.

17. And do not the Romanists dote as much about their unwritten traditions?
hear and judge: first, with them they Council. Trident* Bellarm. de ^erbo.
Coster Enchir.
divide the word of God into verbum (...) and (...), written and unwritten:
their unwritten word is nothing but orall Traditions, delivered (as they say)
by Christ himself to his Apostles alone, and not to his common Disciples,
because it contained the high mysteries of the Kingdom of God, and by them
conuayed to their successors, Bishops and Elders of the Church. Secondly, they
affirm also with them, that these orall Traditions are of equal authority and
necessity with the word written, yea, that the word written is of no authority
at all, quoadnos, in respect of us, except it be authorized by the tradition
of the Church. And thirdly, they teach that the word written is imperfect,
unless the unwritten Cabala be added unto it, and that, not one alone, but
both together make a perfect rule both for faith and manners. Do they not now
Iudaize in all these points? Yes, the Romish Apologers, to prove their doctrine
of traditions, fetch an argument from the Jews Cabala, as may be seen in a
late tractate, falsely called the Catholic Apology: which is so much the more
strange, because their own Sixtus Senensis professes, that the Jewish Thalmud
is fraught with innumerable Sixth. Senens. Biblioth. lib. 2.
blasphemies against God and his Christ our Savior, and impieties against the
law of Moses, besides other infinite fopperies. Is not this then a good
pattern for them to imitate? and is it not a sound argument that is deduced
from such premises? Surely their traditions which they build all their
superstition upon, thus symbolizing with the Jewish Cabala, can be of no better
credit then it is: and what credit that has, not only their Senensis before,
b^t Galatinus, another stout champion of theirs acknowledges, when he says,
that it is mere madness to approve all their unwritten traditions, Galat. de
arcan. v^rit. Cathol. l. 1. c. 7.
which they brag to have been delivered in mount Sinai, and from thence
orderly to have descended to posterity. Now that which he speaks of the Jews
Cabala, may as truly be affirmed of the Romish traditions: let them therefore
go arm in arm together, since they will needs have it so, ^^ joint enemies
to Christian Religion.

18. Again, the Jews ascribe so much credit and faith to their Cachamim or
illumined Doctors, that whatsoever they teach, be it right or wrong, they must
not enquire into the truth thereof, but receive it as an article of their
Creed, and build their faith and salvation thereupon. Thus writes one of their
own Rabbines, to wit, Rabbi Isaac, that died in Portugal, Anno 1493. We are
bound (says he) to give no less Rabbi Isaac Abbu^ah. li. Menoras ha^aer* pa.
23. col. 1.
credit to every Rabbine in their sermons, and mystical or allegorical
explications, then unto the Law of Moses it self: and if there be found in
their words any thing hyperbolicall, or contrary to nature and sense, we must
ascribe the fault thereof to our own defective understanding, and not unto
their words. And the same is the doctrine of their Thalmud. Their speeches
(says it) are Thalmud. tract. de Sab. c. 2. p. 30.
the speeches of the living God, neither does one word of theirs fall to the
ground in vain: and therefore we are bound to believe all things whatsoever
are written of them, or in their name, for it is the truth: neither must any
man laugh at them, neither in his countenance, nor in his heart, for whosoever
shall do so, shall not escape punishment: and his punishment (they say) shall
be this, that he shall be tormented in hell, in boiling excrements. And Lib.
Brandspiegelium.
in another Book the Jews are commanded to say, Amen, not only to their
Prayers, but also to all their Sermons and alle^goricall expositions. Yea, if
two Rabbines contend and contradict Thalmud.
each other, yet they are bound to believe both of them, because the words both
of the one and the other, are the words of the living God, though they
understand not each other. And in a word, so great is their madness, that they
are not ashamed Luther in victo. contra Iud. 107. Rab. Solom. Ia^d. in cap. 17.
Deuteronomy. verse. ^1. Burd. synag. Iud. ca. 1. pa. 66.
to say, That the words of their Rabbines are more to be regarded then the
words of Moses law, and that if they teach that the right hand is the left, and
the left the right, yet they are bound to believe them.

19. And is not the Church of Rome parallel to them in this case? I will not
condemn them, but let their own words be their Judges. Thus write the
Rhemists in their Annotations Rhem. Annot. in Acts 17. 11.
upon Acts 17. 11. The hearers must not try and judge whether their Teachers
doctrine be true or no, neither may they reject H^s. de expresso verbo Dei.
Andrad. defend. Trid. lib. 2. Bell. de verbo Dei interpret. lib. 3. ca. 8. and
9.
that which they find not in Scripture. The same is the tenent of Cardinal
Hosius, Andradius, and all other of that stamp: Bellarmine affirms, that the
people must believe what soever their Passors teach, except they broach somenew
doctrine, which has not been heard of in the Church before: and if they do
so, yet they must not Judge of them, but refer them to the definitive
sentence of the Pope; to the which they must yield full consent without further
examination. Yea, he impudently concludes in another place, That if their
ordinary Pastor teach falsehood, Idem de Clericis lib. ^. cap. 7.
and another that is not their Pastor teach the contrary truth, yet the people
ought to follow their Pastor erring, rather then the other, telling the truth.
And another blasphemous Cardinal gives a reason thereof; Because (says he)
if a man did not believe that Card. Sanct. Angel. ad leg. Bohe^.
Christ is very God and man, and the Pope thought the same, he should not be
condemned. For (says a third Cardinal) the judgment Io. de Tur^ecremat. sum.
de Eccles. li. 2. ca. 26.
of the Pope is the judgment of God, and his sentence the sentence of God. As
if the Judgment and sentence of God could be erroneous, which the first
Cardinal supposes concerning the Pope: or as if the Popes sentence, being
erroneous, could be the sentence of God, as the second affirms. Observe their
blasphemous absurdities. Siluester Prierias concludes this Siluest. Prierias
contra Luther.
point, when he says, That whosoever rests not on the doctrine of the
Roman Church, and Bishop of Rome, as the infallible rule of God, is an
Heretic. And the Canonists stick not R. Cupers de Eccles.
to say, that the Pope is subject to no law, but that his judgment is in stead
of law, and that his actions are not to be enquired Extrau. de translat.
Episcop. and de praebend.
into: neither may a man say unto him, though he lead thousand souls into
hell with him; Sir, why do you thus? and that it is not better then sacrilege
to call in question the Popes fact, or to judge of his actions. Thus an
insallibility of judgment, and an impossibility of erring is ascribed unto the
Bishop of Rome* so that whatsoever he propounds, be it right or wrong, must
be received upon pain of damnation. Neither is it ascribed only unto him the
worlds high Priest, but also to their Councills and inferior Pastors, animated
by his spirit, whose doctrine is to be heard, and not examined, Bell. vt supra.
Nauar. ^^chir. in I. praecept. c. II
as they teach. And therefore it is esteemed a great sin amongst them, for a
man to make question of any doctrine brought unto them by any Romish Jesuit,
Friar, or Priest: and when at any time they are conferred withal about their
Religion, presently, not being able to answer, their refuge is to refer us
over to their Priests; of whose learning and judgment they have such a
persuasion, that though Scripture and reason be against them; yet their
opinions prevail more with them, then either of these. So, that hence it is
most evident, that as the Jews are bound to believe all that their Cachamim
teach, and not to stand to examine what it is that they teach: so the Romanists
are bound by their Religion to entertain into their Creed, whatsoever is
taught them by their ordinary Pastors, without all inquiry and search into
their doctrines, whether they be true or false. And as this is one chiese
cause of the Jews obstinacy against Christian Religion: so is it also of that
miserable superstition which reigns in the Church of Rome: for if the people
were but persuaded, that their learned Doctors might err and deceive, they
would certainly suspect their doctrines, and try them by the touchstone of the
holy Scriptures, and so at length might be reclaimed from their errors: thus
they march together in this point also.

20. Again, the Romanists are like unto the Jews in their doctrine and
practice of praying for the dead: for they hold and teach, that prayer and
sacrifice is to be offered for the dead, grounding their opinion partly upon
the example of Judas Maccabeus, who as they affirm, procured sacrifice to be
2. Maccab. 12. 40. 41. 42. 43.
offered by the Priests, for the dead that had trespassed by taking to
themselves the idolatrous jewels of the Iamnites, and partly upon the
Thalmudical traditions of diverse of their ancient Rabbines: but they have no
ground nor warrant for the same in the word of God: for as concerning the
books of the Maccabees, they themselves acknowledge that they are not
Canonical Scripture: and for the Scripture, we find no such precept or
example in the whole volume of the old and new Testament: neither is it likely
that God would have omitted in the law that kind of sacrifice for the souls
of men, where he prescribes sinne-offerings for bodily pollutions, and every
light trespass, if he had thought it necessary. That this is the opinion and
practice of the Jews, their practice Minhagim page 12. Orach. ^^aij in Nu. 28.
Brandspiegelium.
at this day bears witness: for they use to say over the dead bodies a
certain prayer called Kaddish, by the virtue whereof (as they think) they are
delivered out of Purgatory; especially if it be said by the son for his
father, and if he have no son, by the whole Congregation on their Sabbath
days. And that this also is the doctrine and usage of the Church of Rome,
besides their Books, their Masses for the quick and the dead, their Diriges
and Trentals do sufficiently testify: And that they fetch this custom from
the Jews, may appear by two reasons: first, because one main argument of
theirs, which they call a demonstration to prove the lawfulness hereof, is
derived from the example of the Jews; as we may see both in Galatinus,
Coccius, and our late Galat. de secret. Cathol. fid. Coccius Thesaur. Cathol.
fid. Apolog. Cathol. fid. Bredenbach. de diss. componend.
English Apologists. And secondly, because as it is confessed by their own
Bredenbachius, it is not found in all the writings of the Apostles and
Evangelists in the new Testament, and we may add hereunto, neither in the
old, unless by distorted and misalledged texts, which are not worth the
answering: except only that forenamed passage of the Maccabees, which
notwithstanding is corrupted both by the Translatour, and also the Relatour
Jason Cyreneus, as is unanswerably proved by our famous Countryman, Doctor
Reynolds: Reynold. de Idololat. l. 1. c. 5. sect. 8. and 9.
the word ( Dead) being cogged into the Text by some cunning Iuggler, which is
not in the Original, wherein lies the pith of the argument. And therefore it
must needs follow, that the Romanists do merely Iudaize herein. And for the
Fathers which they allege for the proof of this article, let their own
Cassander give satisfaction: who affirms, Cassand. consult. art. 24.
that the ancient Church used prayers for the dead, either as thankful
congratulations for their present joys, or esse as restimonies of their hope,
and desire of their future resurrection, and consummate blessedness both in
their bodies and souls: and this he proves out of Cyprian, Augustine,
Epiphanius, Chrysostom, and ancient Leiturgies.

21. Again, they Iudaize in their doctrines of Limbus Patrum, and Purgatory:
for Purgatory* it has been already touched in the former section, and for
Limbus Patrum, it is Galatin. Apolog. Cathol fid. Ecclesi* 24. 37. ^^^tak
contra D(...). l. 8. p. 5^7.
co^sessed by our adversaries themselves, that it is the tenent of the Jewish
Rabbines, warranted (as they say) only by a Text in Ecclefiasticus; which
being both corrupted in the translation, as our worthy Champion Doctor
Whitaker has proved: and being also no part of Canonical Scripture, does
plainly show, that it is a mere Rabbinish conceit, hatched in their brainsick
Thalmud, and not bred in holy writ. Yet our Romanists lay fast hold on the same
opinion, without any other certain ground to build it upon. For as touching
the places of Scripture collected by them, to prove this assertion, they are
either so impertinent or distorted, that the meanest judgment may easily
discry their weakness: for either they are derived from a word of an ambiguous
signification, as Bell. de Christi anima. l. 4. ^. 10.
(...) in the speech of Jacob, Genesis 37. 35. which signifies sometimes the
grave, and sometimes hell, by the confession of their great Bellarmine, or from
a Parable, as that place in Luke 16. concerning Abraham's bosom, confessed by
Maldonate Maldonat. in hunc locum.
to be parabolicall, because bodies are not yet tormented in hell: but here is
mention of a finger and a tongue: or from an allegory, as is that place of
Zachary 9. 11. where is mention made of loosing Prisoners out of the pit
wherein is no water, which both Salmeron and Bellarmine acknowledge to make
Salmer. in 1. Cor. 15. disp. 26. Bell. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 3.
more for Purgatory then for Limbus, but in truth for neither: it signifying
literally nothing else, but the deliverance of the Israelites out of the
Babylonish captivity, and tipically the redemption of the Elect from the
bondage of Satan and hell, which they are liable unto: or lastly, are merely
impertinent, as those places, Heb. 11. 39. 4. 1. Reg. 28. 1. Pet. 3. 19: the
first, Ribera coment. in hunc locum*
whereof intends the consummate and perfect blessedness of body and soul,
which the Fathers had not attained unto. The second means not the true
Samuel, but the devil in his August. de octo Dulcit* quaestion.
shape and likeness: and the third is to be referred, not to Christ's
d^scension into hell, but to the operation of his Divinity, which he exercised
from the beginning of the world, preaching by the mouths of just men, as both
S. Augustine Idem. Epistol. ad ^umod^um.
and Aquinas expound the place. How can any sound conclusion now be drawn from
Texts that are either equivocal, Aquin. part. 3. q. 52. art. adsecund.
or allegorical, or parabolicall, or impertinent, and all by their own
confessions? Therefore it must needs follow, that seeing this doctrine has no
sure foundation in Gods word, but is founded upon the Jews profane Thalmud,
that it is no better then a mere Rabbinish conceit.

22. Again, they join hands with the Jews in their doctrines of Free Will,
invocation of Angels and Saints, and merit of good works: all which the
modern Rabbines hold as articles of their Creed, deriuing them from their
predecessors the Pharisees that went before them. Petrus Galatinus that Gala.
de Arno. Cathol. v^nt. lib. 6. ca. 6.
Rabbinish Romanist, reckons up a number of them that were all Patrons of
Free Will, and not as it is set free by grace, (for so we hold that a man has
free will to good) but even by nature before grace, as the Romanists hold. And
so also of Invocation of Saints, some of them affirming that the pure Flau.
Joseph de Bell. Iud. lib. 3. cap. 14. Rabb. Abraham in Genesis 22. Li. praecat.
Judah.
souls which hear them that pray unto them, have a place in heaven. Others,
that the Jews used to interpose in their prayers betwixt them and God, Isaac,
as an intercessour. Others, that prayers are to be made to Angels, to open the
gates of Paradise, and to appease Gods wrath. And lastly, the Romanists Apol.
Cathol.
themselves affirm, that when our Savior cried out on the Cross, Eli, Eli,
etc. the Jews would never have supposed that he had called for Elias, had it
not been an usual practice amongst them to call upon the Saints departed.
Lastly, touching Buxduorf. synag. Iudaic.
the merit of work, the Jews teach, that God once every year, to wit, in the
month of September, at what time he created the world, calls all men's lives
to an account for the year past, and opens three Books, one wherein are
written the names of notorious sinners and Atheists, called The Book of Death:
another, in which are enrolled the names of just and holy men, called The Book
of Life: and a third, for such as are in a mean betwixt both, neither
exceeding bad, nor exceeding good, but of a mixed disposition, and these have
respite given them till the day of reconciliation to repent in, which is the
tenth day of the same month; at which time if their good does exceed their
evil, then it goes well with them; but if their evil exceed their good, then
they are registered presently in the Book of Death. And lest GOD should be
deceived, they say, that he holds in his hand a balance, into one skale
whereof he puts their good works, and into the other their evil deeds, that
he may measure out his rewards according to the weight of the one or the other.
How ridiculous a fable is this? Much like unto the Poetical fiction of Min^s,
Aea^us, and Radamanthus, the three Judges of hell, whom the Poets feign to sit
there, weighing the souls of men, and giving sentence upon them according to
their poyse and weight. By this it appears, that the foolish Rabbines
maintained free will, inuocated Saints and Angels, and esteemed their works
meritorious: All which are the very opinions of the Church of Rome, believed
and practiced of all the professors of that Religion: which is so much the
more absurd, because they themselves confess in special, concerning the
doctrine of Invocation Suarez tom. 2. in 3. part. Thom. q. 52. art. 1. disp. 42
of Saints, that it was not taught unto the people of the old Testament for
fear of Idolatry, nor at the first preaching of the Gospel, for fear it
should seem unto them a hard and harsh doctrine: and in general, that it is
madness to rely our faith upon the Jewish Thalmud, seeing the Thalmudicall
Writers are full of impieties and blasphemies, and therefore Sixth. Senens.
biblioth. Sac. lib. 2. tradit.
have not only been prohibited to be read, but also condemned to the fire by
diverse of their own Popes: all which notwithstanding, our Romish Rabbis fetch
a demonstration for the maintenance of these doctrines, from the example and
practice of the Jews.

23. In like manner the Jews had those that professed a monastical and single
life, which were called Essaeans, from Sigor. de repub. hebraic. l. 5. c. 11.
the Greek word (...) that is, Saints or holy men, as some suppose, because
(^orsooth) they took upon them to be more holy then others; and therefore
would not offer sacrifice with the people, because they thought them not so
holy as themselves. And these, as Josephus and Philo testify, professed
continency from marriage, community in goods, and abstinence from meats, not by
any warrant out of Gods word, but only by the authority of their unwritten
traditions. And do not the Romanists imitate them in the same kind? What are
their Monkish Votaries but Apes of the Jewish Essaeans? And what is their
Monastical profession* but a pretense of a state of rare holiness and
perfection? They vow chastity in single life, and abhor marriage as a state
of pollution: they abstain from meats, and profess voluntary poverty, with a
community of goods: and all this they do, that they may seem more holy then
others, and merit heaven by their holiness, having withal answerable unto
them, nothing but tradition for their warrantize, without either sound precept
or true example out of holy Scripture. For, grant that their Evangelical
Councils are such as they would have them to be, and that vows in Christianity
are lawful: yet it is certain that the authority of Councils, and the
lawfulness of vows do neither warrant nor allow their superstitious and idle
monkery, nor the blasphemous opinion of Bell. de Monac. lib. 2. cap. 6.
merit, which they ascribe unto such voluntary devotions, nor yet the
necessity of irreuocation, though by the frailty of man's nature there be an
impossibility of performance. And so both in substance and circumstance they
want the authority of gods word to uphold them. Let then the Jewish Essaeans,
and the Romish Monks, walk together, as in one path of superstition, so under
one cloak of hypocrisy: for that which Sigonius affirms of the one, that
they were by Nation, Sigon. de Repub. hebrai^. li. 5. c. 11
Jews; and by manners hypocrites, we may truly confirm of the other, that
they are Christians by profession, but hypocrites by conversation. And as those
Essaeans did far degenerate from the ancient Nazarites and Rechabites, whom
they pretended for their patterns: so these do as far and more from those
ancient Monks that lived in former ages of the Church, as is unanswerably
demonstrated by many of the learned Champions of our Church, especially Doctor
D. Mort. protest. App li. 1. c. 2. 38. (...) way to the true Church. ^^g. 45
Mort^n, and Doctor White: to whom I refer the Reader for fuller resolution
in this point.

24. The Jewish Rabbines also taught, that the damned souls in hell and
Purgatory had some refreshing and rest upon every Sabbath day, as soon as a
certain prayer was chanted out by them with sweet melody: and therefore, that
on (...). 14.
every Friday at night there is a great shout in hell for joy of the ensuing
Sabbath, and on their Sabbath day at night a doleful cry for grief of their
return to their pains. Thus the Rabbines doted: And do not our Romish
Rabbines dote in like manner? They also teach, that the damned souls have some
refreshment and ease upon the Sabbath day: as in the Legend. Sancti Brandonis.
legend of S. Brandon it is written, how that holy Abbotfound Judas the
Traitor sitting upon a stone in a certain Island, and demanding of him what
he was, and why heesate in that place: he answered, that upon every Saturday at
noone, until after Euensong upon Sunday, he was suffered to sit there out of
the hellish torments, to be refreshed and comforted during the Sabbath: Now if
Judas found this favor, must we not think that all other obtain the like?

25. The Jewish Rabbines devise strange tales of walking o
ghosts, for the upholding of the walls of Purgatory, as that Rabbi Akiba
should meet once in the way, a man with a heavy burden of sticks on his
back, who upon examination Buxdorf synag. Judaic.
confessed, that he was a Purgatory Ghost, carrying such a bundle of sticks
every day to burn himself: and that the Rabbi finding out his son, taught
him to say the prayer called Kaddisch, which was so effectual, that in a
dream this ghost returned to the Rabbi, with thanks for his delivery, and
said, that he was now in Began Eden or Paradise, and no longer in Purgatory.
This and such like tales they tell for their Purgatory: wherein the Romanists
may behold their face as it were in a glass: for are not their Books and
Legends full stuffed with such trash? is not this article of their Religion
maintained by this argument? are not the minds of the vulgar possessed with
such fearful fables? I will not stand to show how full of falsehood these
narrations are, nor how contrary to the ancient doctrine of the chiefest
Fathers, and Primitive Church; (that shall be discovered in a more proper
place) only I show how poor Purgatory, both with Jews and Romanists, is
vpholden by walking ghosts, or else it would fall to the ground.

26. The Jewish Rabbines teach their people, to confess one to another their
sins the day before their feast of reconciliation, which is the tenth day of
the month Tisri or September and that in a secret place of the Synagogue; where
each receives mutually at his fellows hand with a lether belt 39. blows, and
at each blow the party beaten beats themselves on the breast, and says one
word of his confession, taken out of the 78. Psalm and 13. verse: then the
striker lies down^, and receives like penance at the hands of the former:
this done, they run home, and make merry with the Cocks and Hens of
reconciliation, supping largely because of the next days fast. Now do not our
Romanists imitate them in this May*game of confession, and hypocritical
penance? They must also confess their sins in secret, and receive a short
penance for their long sins, and that once a year principally: with a
certain persuasion of meriting thereby remission of their sins, and when
they have done, do they not return, like the dog to the vomit, to their old
courses? If a man shall observe them well, and compare their practices
together, he shall easily perceive, how both of them alike turn that severe
discipline of the Church which they brag so much of, into a mere mockage and
pastime.

27. The Jewish Rabbines look for Elias the great Prophet, to come before
their long expected Messiah. And doc not our Romish Rabbines tell us that Elias
must come before the second coming of Christ? they are both alike in this
erroneous conceit, save that the Romanists err worse then the Jews, for that
they will have Elias to be the forerunner of Christ's second coming, whereas
the Jews expect him, according to the prophecy of Malachy, together with our
Saviors Malach 45. Matthew. 11. 14.
application thereof, before the first coming of their Messiah.

28. The Jewish Rabbines imagined, that every one had attending upon him two
Angels, one good and another bad, the one to protect and bless him, if he
behaved himself devoutly and reverently in Gods scruice; the other to curse
and afflict him, if he found him failing in his duty. Our Romish Rabbines
teach the fame doctrine, as if all the Angels were not ministering spirits, for
the good of them which are heirs of salvation: and as if a man had but one
cuill spirit to tempt and ^nn^y him, whereas in one man there were found a
whole L^ke ^ ^^. L^ke ^. ^.
legion, and in one woman seven devils at once, as we find recorded in the
history of the Gospel.

29. The Jewish Rabbines taught that those shall be more severely punished, who
should violate the precepts of their Scribes, then they that should transgress
the law of Moses: and do not our Romish Rabbines affirm the same in effect,
when they impose a greater punishment upon the breach of one of their
traditionall decrees, then if a man'breake the precepts of Gods law? as for
example, if a man eat flesh in Lent, or after a vow marry a wife, then if he
commit adultery or break the Sabbath?

30. The Jewish Rabbines persuade the silly people, that they are the only
Elect people of God, who easily can keep not the Decalogue or ten
Commandments alone, but the whole law of Moses: and therefore that the law
consisting of six hundred and thirteen Commandments, whereof three hundred,
threescore and five are prohibitions, as many as are days in a year or veins
in a man's body, and two hundred, forty and eight commanding precepts, just so
many as a man has members in his body; if every member of a man do every day
perform one of the precepts, and omit one of the things prohibited, the whole
law of Moses may be every year, and so for ever fulfilled. Thus they vaunt of
their own strength to save themselves, and therefore seek not for a Savior
without themselves. And what do our Romish Rabbines but the same, when they
affirm, that a man may in this state-of mortality, perfectly fulfill the whole
law: yea, even do more then the law requires, and so supererogate? what need
have these of the death of Christ, to purge away their sins, when they can
thus by the aid of Gods grace (as they say) keep all the Commandments, and
so pay the uttermost debt of their obedience? Let them go together then as
enemies unto Christ in this opinion also.

31. To conclude: the Jewish Pharisees fasted twice a week: so do our Romish
ones, save that they alter the order, but not the number of the days: for the
Jews fast the second and fifth day of the week: the Romanists the fourth and
sixth. The Jewish Pharisees used in a blind devotion, to beat their heads
against the walls, till blood came, to use thorns in their skirts to sting
themselves, to lie on plankes, on stones and thorns, to drench themselves
of^^n cold water for the reserving of their chasti^y: so do ou Romish
P^arises, they make a show of whipping and scourging their own carcasses, of
going barefoote and woollward, of drenching themselves in cold water (as we
read, that Fr ar Frauncis was wont to do) and all (forsooth) both to tame the
rebel'ion of their unruly flesh, which will not be tamed by these means of
their own invention, having left the ordinance of God, and by penance to make
satisfaction for their former sins: but it will one day be said unto them,
who required these things at your hands. In vain ye worship (O ye hypocrites)
teaching ^say 29. 13. Math. 15. 8.
for doctrines precepts of men.

32. The Jewish Pharisees would not converse with any of a different Religion,
especially the Samaritanes, whose Buxdorf. Synop. Iudaic c. 11.
bread they thought it as unlawful to eat, as to eat Swines flesh: and for
Christians, they account it a sin to keep faith and promise with them, to
afford them any succor: yea, not to do them any mischief that lies in their
power: and therefore in their prayers one part of their devotion is, most
direfully to curse all those that profess Christian Religion. The Romish
Pharisees do likewise, they damme all to hell that are not of their Religion,
they deny faith to be kept with Heretics, they hate all that are not subject
to their Pope, but above all, the poor Protestant: him they curse with Bell,
Book and Candle, and abhor him more then a Jew or a Turk: yea, once a year
ordinarily and in public, they curse us to the pit of hell, which I take it to
be upon every good Friday. They say, that the Father may not nourish his own
child, if he be an Heretic, nor the child honor his Father, nor the Prince
defend his Subject, nor the Subject obey his Prince: all bonds of nature,
policy, religion, are pulled in pieces by these Romish Pharisees.

33. The Jewish Pharisees used not to fast without a disfigured face, nor give
an alms without a Trumpet, nor seldom pray, but in the corners of the
streets and highways, that they might be seen of men, all for show,
nothing for substance. And are not our Romish Pharisees their equals in this? Is
not their religion all in ostentation? do they hide themselves when they fast
and pray? do they not blow a trumpet before their deeds of charity? their
hypocritical abstinence from flesh on set days, when as in the mean while
they farse themselves with dainty fish and delicate iunkets; their mumbling up
so many Aue Mary's, and Pater Nosters, in the streets and Marketplaces, their
crow^hing at every Cross; and lastly, their Almsdeeds extorted by fear,
either for penance of sins committed, or in hope of meriting the kingdom of
Heaven, and employed for the most part to the feeding of a multitude of idle
Drones, Monks and Friars, fatted in a Cloister, like Bores in a stye, do
prove this to be true which I have said.

34. The Jewish Pharisees under color of long prayers and great Mat. 23. 14.
devotion, devoured widows houses: the Romish Pharisees by the same pretext of
holiness, suck down into their panches not the Cottage of some poor widow,
but the rich and fair Patrimonies of seduced Gentlemen, Noblemen, and others:
the Jewish Pharisees compassed sea and land to gain Mat. 23. 15.
a Proselite to their profession: our Romish Pharisees travel all Countries,
and labor by all possible means to win souls to their religion, and to
reconcile men to the obedience of the Bishop of Rome; and when they have
wrought their purpose, as those, so these make them twofold more the children
of hell, then they were before.

35. Lastly, the Jewish Pharisees like hypocrites made clean the outside of
the cup and platter, but within were full of bribery and excess; and therefore
are compared by our Savior to whited Tombs, which appear beautiful without,
but within are full of all filthiness. So, our Romish Pharisees come to us in
sheep clothing, giving a bright luster of holiness, and austerity in their
externe behavior; but inwardly are ravening Wolves, devouring the flock, and
have their hearts fraught with all manner of villainy; as lying for advantage,
equivocation, covetousness, ambition, unclean lusts, and other inordinate
affections, as the secular Priests boldly object against the Loyolian Sect, and
are taxed back again by Quodlibet per totum.
them as guilty of the same crimes.

36. This subject might be enlarged by many more particulars, Conclus.
but that I forbear to stir this sink any further, and weary the Reader and
my self, having a long journey yet to travail. This that has been spoken, I
suppose to be sufficient, to prove the truth of the proposition, that the
Romanists imitate the Jews in those things wherein they are enemies unto
Christ, both in respect of the legal Ceremonies, which are vanished by the
appearance of the Sun of righteousness; and also in respect of their
Thalmudieall traditions, which were never found in Gods Book, but are the
foppish dotages of their superstitious Rabbines. And is it not strange, that
notwithstanding all this, they should brag themselves to be the only
Catholics of the world, and their Church the only Noah's Arc, out of the
which there is no salvation?

Si^ia quam similis turpissima bestia nobis,
Tam Rabbinorum ^^bulis Romana cathedra.
Not liker is to Man, the Ape, a filthy Creature,
Then is the Romish Church, unto the Jewish feature.
MOTIVE. IIII. That Religion which derogateth from the glory of God in the
work of our Redemption, and gives part thereof unto man, cannot be the truth
of God: but such is the Popish Religion: Ergo.
THe first proposition, as it is infallibly true of it self, so MAYOR.
is it without all question and controversy betwixt us and the Romanists; for
both confess, that the end of true Religion is, that God might be glorified:
and therefore whatsoever does rebate from that end, cannot possibly be the
truth: Especially, seeing the Lord himself protests, that he will not give
his glory to another, Esaias 48. 11. And Paul affirms, that the end of all our
actions should be the glory of God, 1. Car. 10. 31. Therefore passing over
the Mayor with silence, it is necessary that the Minor or second proposition
be strengthened and confirmed, whereon the hinge of the Controversy hangs,
and the whole pith and substance of this fourth Argument does consist; which by
the assistance of Gods good spirit (whose aid I humbly implore, and of my Lord
and Savior Christ Jesus, whose glory I now labor to maintain) I doubt not
but to make so clear, as is the Sun at Noonday, all clouds, mists, and
fogges, being utterly dispersed.

2. That the Romish Religion does derogate from the glory MINOR.
of God in the work of our redemption, may by four maine and fundamental
doctrines of their Religion most evidently be demonstrated, (besides many other
points of lesser consequence) to wit, their doctrines of Free Will, of
Justification, of merit, and of satisfaction.

3. For the doctrine of Free Will, this is the general determination I.
of the Church of Rome, that in the act of regeneration and conversion, man's
will does naturally cooperate with the grace of God, and that it is not merely
of supernatural grace that a sinner is regenerate, but partly of natural
free will, and partly of grace: whereas, we on the contrary defend, that the
regeneration and conversion of a sinner is wholly of the grace of God, and that
man's will in that great work is merely passive, and not active, yea, stark
dead, until it be excited and quickened by the grace of God: This in brief is
the difference betwixt the Romanists and us in this point. Now, here a double
task lies upon me; first, to prove this to be their doctrine; and secondly,
to show how this doctrine tends to the empeachment of Gods glory.

4. That this is the doctrine of the Church of Rome, let the Council of Trent,
which they call their Church representative, and which being approved by the
Pope, cannot err, as they affirm, be Judge. Thus it decrees, and binds the
decree with a curse: Si quis dixerit, etc. (that is) If any man Council.
Trident. Sess. 6. c. 6. can. 4.
shall say, that man's free will being moved and stirred by God, does nothing
cooperate by assenting to God, moving and calling it, whereby it may dispose
and prepare it self to the obtaining of the grace of justification, and that
it cannot dissent if it will: but like a thing without life, is not at all
active, but merely passive, Anathema sit. Let him be accursed. This Riddle of
the Council of Trent (for so most of the decrees thereof are rather to be
termed, then Canons of faith) is thus expounded by Andradius Andrad. Orthod.
explicat.
interpretation, who was present at the same Council, and knew the meaning of
those holy Fathers; to wit, that there is in every man by nature a power and
ability, Ad inchoandas and perficiendas spirituales actiones, (that is) To
begin and to effect spiritual actions; but that power and ability is so
fettered with the chains of sin, that unless grace come and help to set it
free, it can do nothing: as a man weighed down with iron shoes, though he
has power in himself to go, yet cannot, except his iron shoes be put off: or
as a bird caught in a snare, has power to fly, yet cannot, except the snare
be broken, etc. By these two similitudes, he illustrateth the sentence and
meaning of the Council: whereby it evidently appears, that this is the
plain doctrine of the Church of Rome, that of the regeneration and conversion
of a sinner, the spirit of God is not the sole cause, but that with the spirit
Man's free will does concur, and so both together make the joint efficient
cause.

5. The later Romanists, and especially the Jesuits (to pass over the gross
positions of the former Schoolmen) do more plainly deliver the meaning of
their Church concerning this point. Let us hear Bellarmine speak: Cooperamur
Bell. li. 6. de great. and li. arb. ca. 11.
Deo, etc. We cooperate with God (says he) not only as our Adversaries would
have after justification, but even in very justification it self, and in the
beginning of faith. And after he peremptorily concludes; Non nisi
cooperantibus nobis Deus salutem nostrum operatur^, (that is) God does not
work our salvation without our own help, cooperating with him. We are
beholding to Bellar. for setting down plainly our opinion. For this we hold,
that after the first grace, wherein we are merely passive, we then begin to
will and work our own salvation; but yet not of our selves, as from our
selves, but only of his grace, wherewith as we are prevented to begin, so we
must continually be accompanied that we may persevere: for if God withdrraw
his grace never so little, we are ^ure to sink, as Peter did in the water:
which is the very opinion of Saint Augustine, for in his Enchiridion ad
Laurentium thus he says, Deus nolentempraenenit vt velit, volentem sequitur,
ne Aug. Ench. ca. 32
frustravelit; (that is) God preuenteth a man being unwilling, that he may
will; and follows him being willing, lest he should will in vain. And of
Saint Hierome, who thus speaks Non Hier. ad C^esephont.
sufficit mihi quod semel donauit, nisi semper donauerit, peto vt accipiam, and
cum accepero, rursus peto, (that is) It is not sufficient for me that he has
given me (grace) once, unless he do always give; I pray that I may receive,
and when I have received, I pray again. And again of Saint Augustine, Hominis
non libera, Aug. cont. 2. epist. Pelag. lib. 3. ca. 7
sed Dei gratia liberata voluntas, (that is) Man's will is not free, but freed
by the grace of God. And in another place, Eatenus libera, quantenus liberata,
(that is) It is so farre-forth free, as it is freed, and no further.

6. But to proceed, Coster another Jesuit, is a little more Cost. Ench. de
lib. Arbit. page 208.
plain and gross, Liberum arbitrium, etc. Free Will (says he) does prepare
it self to justification, by the aid of God, not yet inhabiting, but only
moving and helping, not only suffering, but also working and doing. And
again in the same place, Man being fallen into the dark pit of sin, that he
may be drawn out again, does not only receive and suffer, but coworketh with
the grace of God, and prepares himself by believing, trusting, and
undertaking the duties of piety, until arising up to the Son of
Righteousness, he be replenished with the divine light of grace; as Jeremy,
being baled out of the dungeon, helped those which pulled him out, by putting
the cloutes and cords under his armeholes. Salmeron, another Jesuit, is yet
more palpable, Liberum Salmer. tom. 3. page 38.
arbitrium non partem etc. Free will (says he) does not work one part, and
the grace of God another; but to every action is extended as well free will as
grace. But Ecchius surpasses all the Ecchius Enchir.
rest for plainness, for thus he writes, The beginning of our salvation we
have from Gods mercy, but to yield to Gods wholesome inspiration is in our
power, etc. Thus with an impudent forehead, they marry together Gods grace and
man's will in the act of Regeneration, betwixt which, a divorce was made by the
fall of Adam, and so remains irreconciled, till we be engrafted into the
second Adam by faith.

7. Hence it is, that the Council of Trent is bold to affirm, Council.
Trident. Sess. 6. c. 4.
that when equal grace is offered unto two, that one is converted, and the
other remains in his infidelity: the cause is in their wills, in that one
entertaineth, the other rejects the grace that is offered: And to hold this
(says Molyn^ another Jesuit) Molyn. disput. 12
is a matter of faith. And this is the doctrine of Thomas their great Clerk.
It is in the power of our free will (says he) to hinder Aquin. cont. Gent.
lib. 3. c. 159. Ruard. art. 7. Pro. 10. explicat. art. Louan.
or not to hinder the receiving of divine grace. And another more fully and
foully thus dares to speak. If it be demanded why this man is converted and
that man is not, the help of God being given alike to both, the reason is to
be assigned to free will, namely because the one would be converted, and the
other would not: And this also Bellarmine himself acknowledges. Gods motion
Bell. de quot* et lib. arbit. lib. 6. cap. 15.
(says he) leaves man altogether free to be converted, or not to be. Lastly,
they do not only hold, that we have a power in our wills, to move toward our
own conversion, and freely to will or nill the accepting of Gods grace
offered, but also to persevere to the end after grace received. This the
Jesuit Molyn. disput. de lib. arbit.
Molyna does in express words set down, when he says, That the perseverance
of men in good, depends upon their own free cooperation, and the daily
particular divine help. And this is the common received doctrine of the Church
of Rome.

8. Now out of all these their opinions, three material observations do
arise: first, that that Helena of theirs, the merit of congruity, though in
word it be rejected by some of the finer Jesuits, yet in substance and in
truth is still retained: for, whereas the Schoolmen say grossly, that a man by
doing what he is able by the power of his nature, does of congruity merit
effectual grace, the Council of Trent and the later Divines choose rather to
say, that he does dispose and prepare himself to grace, which indeed is in
effect all one: for, to merit grace: and to dispose a man's self to grace, is
in diversity of words, but one and the same sense: and this Bellarmine
ingenuously Bell. de Iustif. lib. 5. cap. 22.
confesses, when he says, that a man not yet reconciled, may by the works of
penance obtain and deserve, ex congruo, of congruity, the grace of
justification. Thus they say and unsay what they list, and gainesay each other,
and indeed are in such a labyrinth, that they know not what to say: Secondly,
that howsoever they magnify the grace of God in word, and affirm nothing more
frequently, then that without Gods grace, preventing, assisting and following
us, we can do nothing, yet in very deed they ascribe well-neere as much power
to free will, as to the grace of God: yea more, for they make the efficacy of
the first grace, to depend upon the free consent of our will, and make it as it
were the Porter to let in, or shut out grace at it pleasure: which is one of
the most presumptuous conceits, that ever was uttered by the mouth of man, and
full of blasphemy. Thirdly and lastly, that this first grace which they say,
does work with free will, in the first act of our new birth, and help and
assist it, is not intrinsicall and inhabitant, but barely outward and
prouocant. In respect whereof, Coster compares grace to a staff in a man's
hand, which at his own will he either uses for his help, or throws away;
and to a friend, who finding a man in a deep pit, persuades him by diverse
reasons to be willing to be pulled out. And in express words the same Jesuit
says, that this grace is only the impulsion and motion of the holy Ghost,
being yet without, and standing knocking at the door of our heart, not being
as yet let in. And Bellarmine avouches the same, when he says, that it is
but only a persuading, which does not determine the will, but inclines it in
manner of a propounding object. And thus under color of the name of grace,
they insinuate into men's souls the poison of their doctrine, attributing in
word all to grace, when indeed they mean nothing less.

9. These things being thus discovered, let us now come to see, how by this
doctrine the glory of God is defaced: which that it may more clearly appear,
two grounds are to be laid: Esaias 48. 11. and 42. 8.
the first whereof is, that God is so jealous of his glory, that he cannot
endure any copartner or sharer with him therein. The second is, that in cases
where grace and nature seem to work together, the godliest course is to
magnify the grace of God, 1. Cor. 4. 7.
and to debase the nature of man, yea, to ascribe all to grace, and nothing to
nature, because this savors of humility, whereas the contrary has a manifest
taste of pride. These grounds being settled in our minds, let us come to the
examination of their doctrine. And I pray you, touching the first ground, does
not this doctrine of theirs make man to part stakes with God? In his glory,
whereas our doctrine does ascribe all the glory in solid, and whole to God
only: let any man judge whether ascribe more glory unto God, we, that affirm
that God is all in all to the effecting of our regeneration, or they that say,
that our will does cooperate with his grace, or else it can do nothing: we
that say, that we are stark dead to Godward, till God put life into us by his
spirit; or they that say, we are but sick and half dead, and are but only
helped and assisted by his spirit: we that teach, that a man can no more
prepare himself to his own justification, then a dead man to life, or they
that teach; we may by our natural powers either merit of congruity, or
prepare our selves to our justification. Lastly, we that ascribe the whole
work of our salvation to God only, or they that attribute some part thereof
to their own free will. If this be not to derogate from Gods glory, what can
be? for apparently they share the great and glorious work of our regeneration
betwixt God and man, grace and nature.

10. Would it not (think you) be a great impeachment to Gods glory, if in the
work of our creation any should teach that God alone did not create us, but
that we our selves were coadiutors with him: so in the work of regeneration*
which is a second creation to attribute part to Gods spirit, and part to
free will, is it not a great blemish to the glory of God? for, either it must
be said, that God could not do it of himself alone, or that he would not: If
the first, then they blaspheme in derogating from his power: if the second,
then they dote in saying, God is not willing to maintain his own glory, or
that he is willing to impart it unto others, contrary to his own word and will
revealed in the Scripture, which way so ever they turn themselves, they fall
into the pit of impiety* and make themselves guilty of high treason against the
divine Majesty.

11. Again, when our Savior raised up Lazarus from the grave, where he lay
stinking four days, if it be true which some write, that Lazarus life was
still remaining in him, and that his soul and body was not parted, and so our
blessed Savior did but excite and stir up that life, which was as it were
asleep, and did not inspire into him a new life, and couple together his soul
and body again being divided, is not the glory of this miracle mightily
darkened and extenuated? This is our very case, we say that a man is stark
dead and buried in the grave of sin, and till a new life of grace be inspired
into his soul, he cannot move the least hairs breadth to heauen-ward* our
adversaries say, that he is not dead, but maimed and wounded like the man, that
betwixt Jericho and Jerusalem fell among thieves; and therefore needs not to
be revived, but only to be healed and helped with the oil and wine of grace
powered into his wounds, he himself cooperating with his own free will: who
sees not that by this doctrine of ours, God is more glorified, and by theirs
more debased? for the less and easier the work is, the less is also the
glory of the worke-man, and the greater and harder the work, the greater his
glory: but it is a less work to heal a man wounded, then to raise a man
dead, and therefore less glory ascends unto God by their doctrine, then by
ours. But what do I say less? when indeed to give any part of the Creators
glory to the creature, is utterly to take all from the Creator: for he will
have all or none, as Tertullian notably Tertul. aduers. haeres.
observes, when he says, That true faith requires this in defending the true
God, that whatsoever is his, we make it only his, for so shall it be
accounted his, if it be accounted only his, by which rule, the faith of the
Roman Church cannot be the true faith.

12. And again, according to the second ground, if to give all the glory to
God, and none to our selves, savor of humility, but to divide stakes betwixt
God and our selves, has a taste of pride: then it must needs follow, that God
is more honored by the one then by the other, because by humility God is
honored, and by pride dishonored: and therefore the Apostle says, that he
resists the proud, and gives 1. Pet. 5. 5.
grace to the humble: for what cause? but because the proud man seeks his
own glory, whereas the humble deuesteth himself of all, and lays it down
at the foot of God: the proud man rejoices in himself, but the humble
rejoices in the Lord alone, according as it is written, Let 1. Cor. 1. 31.
Ier. 9. 24.
him that rejoices, rejoice in the Lord. Now the Romanists that magnify
free will, have just cause (their doctrine being presupposed to be true) to
rejoice in themselves, which is an argument of pride: for, whereas our Savior
says, Without me Ioh. 15. 5.
ye can do nothing, they may say, Yes something, for we can either admit or
reject thy grace by our own power: and whereas the Apostle says, Who has
separated thee, what have 1. Cor. 4. 7.
thou which thou have not received? they may say, I have separated my self in
doing that which I was able, and so made my self fit for grace, and this power
I have not received from Gods special favor, but from my own free will. All
which kind of speeches, as they are full of pride and fleshly vanity, so they
are stuffed with impiety and blasphemy, and manifestly tend to the dispoyling
of the divine Majesty of that glory, which is only due unto him. And
therefore I conclude with two notable sayings, one of S. Augustines, and
another of Cassander, a learned Reconciliater of late time; Tutiores viuimus
(says the Father) si totum Deo damus, etc. August. de bono Persevere. c. 6.
that is, We live more safely if we attribute all wholly to God, and not commit
our selves partly to God, and partly to our selves. And this is the part of a
godly minded man (says the Reconciliater) to attribute nothing to themselves,
but all to Gods grace: whence Cassand. consult. de lib. arbitr.
it follows, that how much so ever a man gives to grace* yet in so doing,
he departs not from piety, though he detract something from nature and
freewill: but when any thing is taken from Gods grace, and given to nature,
which belongs to grace, that cannot be without eminent danger. So that by the
confession both of this learned Romanist, and also of that reverend Father, our
doctrine in the point of free will, is both more agreeable to piety, and
respective to Gods glory, then theirs is; and therefore in reason to be
preferred before it.

13. The next doctrine whereby the glory of God is darkened, 2.
and the dignity of Christ's merits blemished, is their doctrine of
Justification, which I join next unto Free Will, because their sophistry and
cunning in this great and maine pillar of Religion cannot well be discerned
(they so palliate the matter with fair glosses and goodly words*) except their
opinion touching the power of Free Will be first apprehended. And here, before
I enter into the bowels of this point, it is to be observed, that most of them
vaunt and brag that they do much more magnify Christ's merits by their
doctrine of Justification, then we do: which, how true it is, the discourse
following (I hope) shall so manifest, that every indifferent man shall be able
to say truly of them, as Saint Augustine said of the Donatists, These are the
words of men, extolling the glory Aug. cont. lit. Petil. li. 2. ca. 84.
of man, under the name of Christ, to the abasing of the glory of Christ
himself.

14. The doctrine therefore of our Church touching the justification of a
sinner, is in effect thus much. That a sinner is justified that is accepted
into the favor and love of God, not by any thing in himself, or from
himself, but by the perfect and unspotted righteousness of Christ Jesus,
imputed unto him by the mere mercy of God, through the covenant of grace, and
apprehended on his behalf by the hand of faith. The reason whereof is, because
that which must satisfy Gods justice, and reconcile a sinner unto him, must
have these two properties; first, it must be of infinite weight and value, to
counterpoyse with the rigor of Gods justice: and secondly, it must be of
sufficient ability to performefull and perfect obedience to the law of God; so
that a perfect satisfaction be made both in respect of the obedience which the
law requires, and also of the punishment that it inflicteth. Now, no
righteousness of man is thus qualified, but is both imperfect and
insufficient; no, not the righteousness of Angels themselves, being, though
excellent, yet ^^finite Creatures, saving the righteousness of Christ Jesus
only, who is both God and Man; and therefore his righteousness only, and none
other, is that whereby a sinner must be justified before God.

15. From this it appears, that when we say that a man is justified by faith,
our meaning is not, that faith is the cause of our justification, but only the
instrument and hand to apprehend that righteousness of Christ whereby we are
justified: and when we say, faith alone just fieth; we mean that it alone is
the instrument of our justification, because it alone lays hold upon the
righteousness of Christ, and applies it to our selves: not that it is ever
alone, but always accompanied with charity and patience, and zeal, and
temperance, and other fruits of the spirit: for we hold, that the true
justifying faith is ever m^^re grauida bonoru^ operu^, as one of their own
favorites affirms, that is, full of good works, and ever Roff. art. 1.
aduers Luther.
anon ready to bring them forth, as occasion serves. Neither do we deny, as
some of them falsely slander us (though many Staplet. li. 9. de Iu^^fic. ca. 7.
Bell. lib. 4. de Iustific* cap. 1.
of their chiefest Writers gainsay their fellows, and afford us that favor
to speak the truth of us) but that every one that is justified must also be
truly sanctified, and that salvation is not obtained by justification alone,
but by sanctification also: yet we make sanctification and good works not to
be the causes, but the effects; nor the root, but the fruit; nor the
anticedents, but the necessary consequents and attendants of our Justification.
And as Bellarmine truly distinguishes Bell* Ibid.
to be necessary, Necessitate praesentiae, non efficientiae, by a necessity of
presence, not of efficacy, as if they wrought our salvation. In a word, In the
act of justification, we say that works have no room, because both they are
imperfect, and also are not done by our own strength; but being once justified,
we must needs repent, and become new creatures, walking not according to the
flesh, but according to the Spirit. And this is the doctrine of our Church
concerning Justification.

16. Now let us hear what they say, and then weigh both doctrines in the
balance of the sanctuary, that we may see which of them brings most glory
to the merits of CHRIST, and to the power of his satisfaction. I will plainly
and sincerely (God willing) set down the sum of their doctrine. First
therefore they teach, that there is a double justification, the first whereby a
man ex iniusto Cost. Ench. ^eca^. disp. Theolog.
fit iustus, of an unjust and wicked man is made just and good, and of a sinner
is made righteous; the second whereby a man being just is made more just, and
does increase in justice and sanctity, according to that Revel. 22. 11. He that
Revel. 22. 11.
is just, let him be more just. Concerning the first justification, some of
them affirm, that it is the free gift of God, and deserved by no precedent
works; others that it is merited by congruity, but not by condignity: but of
the second, they Cens. Coloniens. page 140. 141. Becan. Ibid.
say, that it is gotten and merited by our works. But before both these, they
make certain preparations and dispositions, whereby a man by the power of his
own free will stirred up Council. Trident. Sess. 6. cap. 6. Bell. lib. 1. de
Just. cap. 13.
by grace, does make himself fit for justification, namely, by the acts of
faith, fear, hope, love, repentance, and the purpose of a new life; all which
a man must have before he receive the first grace of justification: and for
the obtaining whereof, he needs not any grace internally infused, but only
offered externally. Whereupon they are bold to affirm, that the act of
Justification does emane and proceed, Simul Molina. disput.
ab arbitrio and a Deo, Both from free will, and from God. Now the causes of
justification, the Council of Trent makes to be these; the final cause, Gods
glory, and man's salvation; the efficient, Gods mercy; the meritorious cause,
Christ's merits; the isntrumental, the Sacrament of Baptism; but the formal
cause, which is the chiefest and (...), Dat esse rei, gives being to the
thing, as the Logicians speak, they make to be an inherent righteousness
wrought in us, and inspired into us by the Spirit of God. And this in brief is
the doctrine of the Church of Rome, touching the justification of a sinner.

17. Wherein let us observe three maine and fundamental differences, betwixt
their doctrine and ours; in all which they raze the foundation, and dedignifie
the merits of Christ, and the mercy of God, to extol the dignity of man. The
first in their preparations, we hold that a man cannot any ways dispose
himself unto grace, but is wholly fitted and prepared by God; and that those
acts of preparation (as they call them) are not forerunners of justification,
but rather fruits and effects thereof, they teach the contrary, as I have
showed. The second difference is, that the works of a man justified do not
merit increase of grace, which they term the second justification: but as the
beginning of grace is from gods mercy alone, so the increase and augmentation
thereof and perseverance therein, is only to be ascribed to the work of Gods
spirit, according to that of Saint Paul, Phil. 1. 6. He that has begun Phil.
1. 6.
this good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: this
we hold, they the contrary. The third difference is in the formal cause of our
justification, which they maintain to be an inherent righteousness within us,
even the righteousness of Sanctification. We on the other side affirm, that the
formal cause of our justification, is the righteousness of Christ Jesus, not
dwelling in us, nor proceeding from us, but imputed unto us by the mercy of God.

18. Having thus laid open both our doctrines, let us examine and try which of
them gives most glory unto God, and most exalts the merits of Christ, for
that must needs be the truth; and which lifts up highest the proud nature of
man, for that must needs be falsehood and error: especially, seeing that Gods
dignity, and the dignity of man; Christ's merits and man's, are as it were, two
skales of a balance, wh^reof the one rising, the other falls, the one lifted
up, the other is pressed down. First therefore, touching the works of
preparation, whether do they more magnify Gods mercy, that say a man cannot
prepare and dispose himself at all to grace, but is wholly disposed and
prepared by God; or they that affirm that a man can prepare himself by his
own endeavor, assisted outwardly with the grace of God? the one makes Gods
mercy the sole cause of justification, the other but the adi^vant and helping
cause. And whether do they advance most the dignity of man, that say, that a
man can do nothing of himself for his own justification, or they that say
that a man can do something to the preparation of himself to that great
work; the one attributes some dignity to man, the other, none at all; we
affirm the one part, the Romanists the contrary: and therefore our doctrine
tends more to the debasing of man's worth, and consequently to the exalting of
Gods glory, then theirs does.

19. True it is, like Ferrimen, that look East and go West, they with their
great Grandfather Pelagius, talk of grace, when they mean nothing but
nature, and so deny indeed that which they affirm in word, if the matter be
examined according to truth. For Pelagius confessed a necessity of grace Aug.
cont. Pelag. and Celest. lib. 1. cap. 31. 33.
in all spiritual actions, and yet was condemned for an enemy to grace, by the
Church of God, because he understood not by grace the sanctifying work of
Gods spirit, but an outward moving and persuading power, assisting man's
free will to the effecting of his own salvation. The very same is the doctrine
of the Romanists, as has been declared, and therefore we may justly condemn
them as enemies to the grace of God, whatsoever they brag and vaunt to the
contrary.

20. Secondly, touching the second justification, which stands, as they say,
in the augmentation and increase of our justice: let the most partial Reader
judge, whether tends most to the magnifying of Gods glory, their doctrine which
teaches that we merit the increase of our justice by our own works: or
ours, which teaches, that both the seed and the growth, both the root and the
fruit, both the beginning and increase of all righteousness, is the work of
Gods spirit alone, preventing, assisting, and upholding us to the end; and that
these several works of grace are bestowed upon us, not for any merits of our
own, but simply and entirely for the merits of Christ Jesus. I, but they will
say, works do not merit justification, because they are ours, but because they
are works of grace, which grace flows from the fountain of Christ's merits,
and so they attribute as much, or more, to grace and Christ's merits, then we
do. To which I answer, two things: first, if they held that these works were
merely from grace, they said something to the purpose, but affirming as they
do, that they are partly from grace, and partly from the power of free will,
as two joint causes, this their something is nothing, but a vizard to cover the
ugly face of their error. Secondly, let this be granted, that their doctrine
is, that they proceed only from grace, nevertheless being wrought in man,
and acted by man, they must needs be called, and be indeed in part man's
works, because man does cooperate with grace; and therefore to make them
meritorious absolutely of grace, must needs tend in part to the exalting of
man's dignity, and consequently in part to the impeachment of Gods. For, let an
answer be given to this question, by what means does a man continue in
justice, and increase in holiness: We answer with Saint Paul, By the grace
of God only, who as he has begun that Phil. 1. 6.
good work in us, so will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: but the
Romanists will answer, that this is done by the merit of our own works:
which works howsoever they may Becan. disput. page 195.
color the matter, by saying, they are works of grace, and receive power from
Christ's merits, yet being the works of man also, by the power of his free will,
who sees not, but that Gods glory is greatly blemished hereby, and man's worth
extolled?

21. Thirdly, touching the form of justification, which of us does most honor
to God? they which teach that it is an inherent righteousness habituated in
us, or we that say, that it is Christ's righteousness imputed unto us? we
attribute all unto Christ, and nothing to our selves: they share the matter
betwixt Christ and our selves: for this inherent righteousness, though it
proceed from Gods spirit, as they say, and is a work of grace, yet in three
respects it may be called our righteousness by their doctrine: first, in
respect of the root and spring of it, which is, as they affirm, partly grace
and partly nature. Secondly, in respect of the subject, which is the soul of
man, which may be also called the instrument by which it is effected; and that
not a dead subject or liuelesse instrument, as we say man's nature is, till it
be lived and quickened by Gods spirit, but of it self living and quick, and
fit for so great a work. Thirdly, In respect of the medium or mean, by which
it is attained, which they hold is the merit of our own works, as I have
sufficiently discovered out of their own books. Now then, if this inherent
righteousness be in part our own, and not wholly Christ's, but the
righteousness imputed be wholly and entirely Christ's, and not in any respect
ours, save that it is given unto us, and made ours by imputation; who can doubt
but that this our doctrine is far more available for the advancement of
Christ's glory, and debasing of man's excellency, then theirs is? Add hereunto,
that it must needs be a dishonor to God, to say, that an imperfect, a
polluted and a stained righteousness, such as the best of ours is, can
satisfy the absolute and most exact justice of God: but it is an extolling
glory to Gods justice, to say that it cannot be answered, but by the most
perfect and absolute righteousness that ever was in the world; such as the
righteousness of the Son of God is, who taking our flesh upon him, performed
in the same, all righteousness, that the strictest justice of God required,
for our sakes.

22. All which things laid together and diligently weighed, we may see what
caused all the Saints of God, when they Esaias 64. 6. Dan. 9. 13. Psalm. 143. 2.
Romans 7. 14. 19. 20. 1. Cor. ^* ^. etc.
came to pl^ad their causes, before the tribunal of Gods judgment, to
disclaim all their own righteousness, and to lay fast hold upon the
righteousness of Christ the Mediator, and the mercies of God in him, who is the
fountain of all mercy; even this, because they perceived that by this
deiecting and despoyling of themselves of all worthiness, Gods glory was
greatly magnified, as also when they examined their best works by the rule of
the law, their own consciences told them, that they were not able to abide the
trial, if they should be weighed in the balance of justice, and not of mercy.
Therefore this is the common voice of all Gods Saints: Enter Psalm. 143. 2.
not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy sight shall none that
lives be justified: to which, in a sweet harmony accord all the Fathers. Who
will glory concerning his righteousness Origin in Romans cap. 3.
(says Origin) seeing he hears God saying by his Prophet, All your
righteousness is as a cloth of a menstruous woman, our perfection it self is
not void of fault (says Gregory) unless the severe Gregor. moral. l. 5. cap.
8.
Judge do weigh it mercifully in the subtle scales of his justice: Who so
lives here, howsoever justly he live. yet woe unto him (says S. Augustine) if
God enter into judgment with him: if our justice Aug. in Psalm. 42. Bernar. in
fest. omnium Sanctor. ser. 1. Bell. de Iustific. lib. 5. cap. 7.
be strictly judged (says S. Bernard) it will be found unjust and scant. And
this infallible truth wr^ng out of Bellarmine himself, though unawares, this
plain confession: Tutissimum est in sola Dei misericordia conquiescere, etc.
that is, it is the safest course to repose our confidence (what in our own
righteousness? no): in the sole mercy of God. Is it the safest course for man's
salvation? so is it for the advancement of Gods glory, for the one is
subordinate to the other: who then that has but common sense, will not choose
rather to repose the hope of his salvation on Gods mercy, then on his own
righteousness? at leastwise if he regard either Gods glory, which all
should, and that above all, or his own souls health, which should be next to
the other in our desires.

23. By this it may appear, what a vain brag that is of some of them, who
boast that they do much more magnify Christ and his merits then we do,
because we make them D. Bishop cont. Refor. Catholic.
(say they) so mean, as that they serve the turn only to cover and hide
sin: whereas they contrariwise do so highly esteem them, that they hold them
able, both to purchase at Gods hand an inherent righteous^esse: and to give it
such force and value, that it can make a man just before God, and worthy of the
kingdom of heaven. In which brave vaunt, there lie lurking no l^sse then three
gross absurdities. First, they lay a false ^mputa^ion upon our doctrine, that
we should hold Christ's merits to be so mean, as to serve only to cover and
hide sin; whereas we expressly teach, and that with one consent, that for the
merits of Christ, not only our sins are pardoned, but also that grace is
inspired into our souls, and sanctification, and new obedience, and Christ is
made unto us of God, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption:
1. Cor. 1. 30.
by which it appears, that we ascribe even as much in this regard to Christ's
merits, as they do; and therefore this is a mere cavil and slander, hatched by
them to breed disgrace to our Religion. Next, they contradict themselves: for
to say, that Christ gives strength to our righteousness to purchase heaven,
is to affi^me, that without our help, Christ's righteousness was not of
sufficient value to make that purchase: and yet the same men say, that Christ's
righteousness was of infinite value. Now if it were of infinite value, then it
made the full and perfect purchase it self: and if it made the full purchase,
then he need not give strength to our righteousness to do the same. Thus either
the one or the other must needs be false, except we will have a double
purchase of one and the same thing, and a double satisfaction of the same debt,
which is in no case agreeable to the justice of God. Lastly, they show their
arrogancy, in that they scorn to receive the kingdom of heaven, as an alms
and free gift from God of his mere mercy toward them: but they will have it
like sturdy and proud companions, as a due unto their deserts, or a recompense
to their service: nay, they will not have it from Bell. de purgat* lib. 1. cap.
14.
Christ's purchase alone, but they will be joined purchasers with him, or else
they will have none of it: then which, what can be greater arrogancy? And thus
by this vain vaunt they fall into diverse palpable absurdities, and plainly
discover, that it cannot any way be avoided, but that by their doctrine of
justification, they do exalt the dignity of man, and pull down the glory of
Christ our Savior.

24. The third doctrine whereby they derogate from Gods 3.
glory, is their monster of merit, which I put in the next place, because it
issues from the two former, as the Progenitors thereof, the doctrine of
justification by inherent righteousness, being as it were the mother of it,
and that of free will the Grandmother: and so it cannot be, the fountain
being poisoned, but that the waters streaming therefrom, must needs be
infected: and because malum crescit eundo, an evil grows worse by
propagation, and the daughter commonly exceeds the mother in naughtiness,
therefore this doctrine is fur more blasphemous, then either of the former,
and exceeds them, both in derogating from Gods glory, and setting up man's
dignity against God. And the Proctors of the Romish Court, in no subject do
more throat it out, then they do in this, nor take more pains in any, as if
their liuelyhood lay upon it. And yet, if we draw near unto them, we shall
easily perceive, that all is but a vain blast of words puffing up the proud
heart of man, and pulling down the glory of Christ, as I hope I shall plainly
and briefly manifest by the discourse following.

25. Their doctrine touching the merit of works, is in brief this, that
there is such a dignity, excellency, and perfection in the works of the
Regenerate, that by the rule of justice they do not only deserve temporal
and spiritual blessings here in this world, but also eternal life and
everlasting bliss in the world to come. In which doctrine, these three points
are to be considered: first, that they make the good works of the faithful
absolutely and perfectly good, Bell* de just. li. 4. cap. 16.
able to stand out with the justice of God, and answer the full rigor of the
Law: secondly, they make them proportionable to the reward, for betwixt meritum
and debitum, properly taken, as they do, there is always a Geometrical
proportion: and thirdly, they place this meritorious dignity in the work
done, as it is a work, and that not passiuely, as it is wrought in us by
grace, but actiuely as it works by freewill, as has been showed.

26. That all these things are thus, as I have said, let us hear themselves
speaking in their own words. The works of the Bell. de Just. li. 4. cap. 16.
just (says Bellarmine) are simply and absolutely good. And in another place,
They are so good and so perfect, that God were Idem lib. 5. cap. 16. and 17.
unjust, if he should not reward them with eternal life: and, that not only
in respect of Gods promises, but even in respect of the works themselves. And
to prove this, he produces seven strong reasons, as he thinks, but indeed
weak ones, if they be thoroughly examined. Andradius, the approved
interpretour and defender of the Council of Trent, goes further, And. Orthod.
^xpl c. lib. 6.
and says, that the heavenly blessedness, which the Scripture calls the
reward of the just, is not given them of God gratis, and freely, but is due to
their works, yea God has set forth heaven to sale for our works. Bellarmine
also calls good works, Mercatura regni coelestis, the purchasing of Heaven.
The Rhemists Rhem. Annot. 2. Tim. 4 8. Heb. 6. 10.
are yet more insolent: Good works (say they) are truly and properly
meritorious, and fully worthy of everlasting life, heaven is the due and just
stipend which God by his justice owes to the persons working by his grace, and
that God should be unjust, if Ruard. Tapper in expli. art. Louan. tom. 2. art.
9.
he rendered not heaven for the same. But Ruardus Tapper is yet more impudent,
for he says, God forbid that the just should expect eternal life, as the
poor man does an alms, it is much more glorious that they should have it as
Conquerours and Triumphers, Greg. de Valen. tom. 3. disp. 7. q. 2 de Indulgent.
as the prize due unto their labors. Gregory de Valentia goes yet further,
and says, That the works of the faithful, beside their strength of meriting,
have also a power of satisfying for the punishment.

27. Touching the proportion of our works, with the reward, Bellarmine says,
That in a good work proceeding from Bell. de Just. li. 5* cap. 17.
grace, there is a certain proportion and equality, to the reward of eternal
life, and that not only in regard of the promise and acceptance, but even of
the work it self. And this he proves in the place quoted by many arguments,
which are worthy to be read, that we may see the very pith and substance of
their opinion, touching the merit of works. True it is, Bellarmine does not
make this proportion an absolute equality betwixt the work and the reward,
according to the rule of commutatiue Idem li. 5. ca. 16.
justice, but only by the rule of distributive justice, which has respect not
so much to the work, as to the worthiness of the person working. But herein
he crosses other his fellow Jesuits; For Suarez says, That a supernatural
work proceeding Suarez. tom. 1. in Thom. 3. d. 41. Sect. 3. Cost. Ench. ca. 7.
from grace, within it self, and of it own nature, has a proportion and
condignity with the reward, and a sufficient value to be worth the same. And
C^ster affirms, that the reward which God gives to our works, belongs
after a sort both to commutatiue and distributive justice, though the
distributive part of justice, which requires the dignity of the persons, does
more shine forth in it then the commutatiue, which considers the equality of
works. And the Rhemists, That our works of their Rhem. Annot. in 1. Cor. 3. 8.
very nature deserve eternal life, the reward whereof is a thing equally and
justly answering to the line and weight of the work, rather then a free gift.
Yea, he crosses himself, for in the seventeenth chapter, he avouches that
the proportion betwixt the work and the reward, is ratione operis, in respect
of the work. Now I confess that some of them affirm indeed, the reason of
meriting of our works, to arise partly from this that we are adopted the
sons of God, and have union with Christ, and so they are made meritorious by
the dignity of the person which works them: and partly because they proceed
from grace; and also, partly by reason of the promise which God has made unto
them, whereby he binds himself that he will reward them: but let all these
Andr. Orth. explicat. lib. 6. Caiet. 1. 2. q. 114. Bayus de merit. lib. 2. ca.
1. and 4.
be granted (though all of them be denied by many of their own Writers, who
attribute merit to the work, without relation either to the person, or to
grace, or to the promise) yet it will not free their doctrine from palpable
impiety, as the sequent discourse shall (I trust) make apparent. After that I
have in opposition to this doctrine set down the sum of that which we hold
touching the dignity of good works. I omit to name their merit of co^gruity,
because most of themselves are ashamed of it.

28. This is therefore that doctrine which our Church maintains concerning
good works: First, we believe assuredly that good works are necessary to
salvation, but so, Vt via regni, non causae regnandi, as the way to the
Kingdom, Bern. de great. and lib. Arbitr.
not causes of reigning, and as signs of our Election, and forerunners of our
future happiness, as Saint Bernard testifies. This with one consent we all
teach, and the Romanists that slander us with the contrary assertion, cannot
produce so much as one sentence out of any of our Writers, which being rightly
understood, does import the contrary, as shall be hereafter fully proved.
Secondly, we hold, that as they are necessary in respect of us, so they are
acceptable and well pleasing to God, not for their own sakes, but for our
faith-sake in Christ, in whom only the Lord is well pleased, both toward
himself and all his members. Thirdly, we believe that they are not only thus
acceptable and well pleasing in Gods sight, but also that the Lord will reward
them assuredly both in this life with temporal blessings, and in the life to
come with eternal happiness; according to that of our Savior, Whosoever Mat.
10. 42.
shall give unto one of those little ones to drink a cup of cold water, in the
name of a Disciple, he shall not lose his reward. But lastly, we constantly
assure our selves, that this reward is not given of God for the merit or
desert of the work, but of the mere grace and mercy of God for the merits of
Christ: according to that of Saint Bernard, The mercy of God is my merit: Ber.
in Ca^. ser. 61 Aug. de great. and lib. arbit. cap. 9.
and of Saint Augustine, God brings us to eternal life, not for our merits,
but for his own mercy. For a reward is not only taken for a due debt in
Scripture, but also for a free gift, as may appear by comparing Mat. 5. 46.
with Luke 6. 32. Mat. 5. 46. Luke 6. 32.
In the one place whereof the Holy Ghost uses the word (...), in the other
(...), speaking of the one and the same thing. So that the sum of our
doctrine is this in few words, we renounce not good works, but the merit of
works: and we verily believe that Christ is the storehouse of all merit,
and that out of him there is no merit to be found in any, no not in the
iustest that ever lived: and yet the merits of Christ, as his righteousness,
are made ours by imputation; and in that sense only we may be said to merit
and deserve eternal life. As for our best works, though they be wrought in
us by grace, yet passing through the corrupt channel of our defiled nature,
they get themselves such a tincture and stain, as in regard of the corruption
which cleaves close unto them, they can deserve nothing at Gods hand, if he
should lay them to the rule of his justice, and not weigh them in the balance
of his mercy. This is our doctrine: and that it is so, I appeal to Bellarmine
himself, who confesses, that by faith alone we Bell. de just. li. 4. cap. 1.
do not exclude other virtues, but the merit of them; and that we make good
works necessary to salvation, Necessitate praesentiae, non efficientiae, as he
terms it, By necessity of their presence, not by necessity of efficiencie.
Let us therefore now come to the examination of both these doctrines, and
search which of them does give most glory to God, and honor to Christ our
Savior in this maine pillar of our Redemption.

29. And first, does not that doctrine tend manifestly to the embasing of Gods
mercy, which teaches men not to rely wholly upon that for their salvation,
but partly upon their own merits? Especially, seeing grace and works, merit
and mercy, cannot stand together, no more then light and Romans 1^. 6.
darkness, as the Apostle teaches, If it be of grace, it is no more of works,
or else were grace no more grace; but if it be of works, it is no more grace,
or else were work no more work. So may we truly say, If salvation be of
mercy, then it is not of merit, or else were mercy no more mercy; but if it be
of merit, it is no more of mercy, or else were merit no more merit: and so by
kindling the fire of merits, they utterly dry up the fountain of mercy. And
for that cause Saint Bernard makes the Quo supra.
mercy of God his only merit. And Saint Augustine disclayming all merits, and
laying claim only to Gods mercy, says as before; God brings us to eternal
life, not for our merits, but for his own mercy: And in another place, His
promise Aug. in Psalm. 88.
is sure, not according to our merits, but according to his Chrysostom. in Colos.
hom. 2.
mercy. And Chrysostom says, That no man shows such conversation of life,
as that he may be worthy of the Kingdom of heaven, but it is wholly the gift
of God. In all these places merit is opposed unto mercy, as things of their
own condition incompatible, and therefore one must needs exclude the other.
Aug. cont. Pelag. and Celest. lib. 2. cap. 24.
And sure in reason it must needs be so, for mercy is free, Grace is not grace
in any sort, if it be not free in every sort (says Augustine) but merit
requires the reward of debt: Mercies object is misery and unworthiness, but
merit is dignity and worthiness, and therefore cannot be the object of mercy:
Mercy rejoices against justice, but merit appealeth unto justice, and
challenges God of injustice, if it be not recompensed. Lastly, in mercy, God
is the Agent, and sinful Man the Patient; but in merit, righteous Man is the
Agent, and God the Patient. And therefore, betwixt these two things, Merit and
Mercy, there is such a disproportion and contrariety, that they cannot be
reconciled together.

30. I but they say, our works are not meritorious of themselves, but partly
as they proceed from grace, and are wrought in us by Gods Spirit, and so it is
Gods mercy, that we are enabled to merit; and partly by virtue of Gods promise,
whereby he has engaged himself to crown those merits with glory, which he
has wrought in us by grace: to which double objection I return this double
answer. First, if all good works issue from the root of grace, as they do
indeed, then how can we merit thereby, seeing that which does merit, must be
our own, and not another, especially his of whom we look to merit? (So says
Hilary) it is for him Hilar. de trinit. lib. 11.
to merit, who himself is to himself the Author of getting his merit: and
therefore if it be true which they affirm, that Gods grace is the only
fountain of all good works (as without doubt it is) it is so far from
following thence, that therefore our works are meritorious, that it follows
by mere necessary consequence, that therefore they are not meritorious. And
this conclusion is made by diverse of the ancient Fathers themselves, We have
nothing to rejoice or glory of (says S. Cyprian) Cyprian ad Quir. lib. 3. c.
5. Bern. in annun. ser. 1.
therefore nothing to merit, because we have nothing of our own: The merits of
men are not such (says S. Bernard) as that life eternal by right is owing for
them (and why?) because all merits are the gifts of God; and so man is rather a
debtor to God for them, then God to man. And S. Augustine, Eternal life should
Aug. epist. 105.
be rendered as due unto thee, if of thy self thou had the righteousness, to
which it is due: but now of his fullness we receive not only grace now to
live justly in our labors to the end, but also grace for this grace, that
afterward we may live in rest without rest. So then, if our good works arise
only from Gods grace, this makes plain against all merit, as they know well
enough, and therefore (behold their fraud, and the mystery of iniquity) though
they shadow the matter with goodly words of grace and mercy, yet upon free will
they hang the virtue and effect of this grace, and from that fountain do they
derive unto man all this merit, which they talk so much of: and so howsoever
they ascribe unto Gods grace the cause of merit, yet Bell. de Iustific. lib. 5.
cap. 10.
in very deed with them, it is free will that makes a work meritorious.

31. Secondly, I answer, that when God does promise to reward our works with
eternal life, eternal life is due to us, but not for our works sake, but for
his promise sake: for many things are due by promise, which have no reference
to any desert. As if the King should promise one of his servants a thousand
pound of his mere liberality, for keeping a Hawke, he is bound to pay him so
much: but is it from the servants desert, or from the Kings bounty? So God
promises eternal life to our works, and by reason of his promise, we may
challenge it as our due, but yet it is not for our work, but for his word
sake, as Saint Augustine confesses, when he says: God is become a debtor, not
by receiving Aug. de verbis Apostol. ser. 16.
any thing from us, but by promising what it pleased him: therefore a reward
given by promise, is so far from importing desert, that it rather overthrows
the very foundation thereof, by being a work of mercy: as the same Augustine
says in another place: The promise is sure, not according to our merits, but
according to his mercy. The doctrine of merit then undermines the mercy of
God, which way so ever they turn themselves, whether to grace, as the cause of
the work, or to Gods promise, as the cause of the reward.

32. Again, by this doctrine, not only the mercy of God is darkened, but also
the merits of Christ quite euacuated, and made of no force: for if Christ's
merits were sufficient, what need there then any supply of our own: if our
own merits be necessarily required, then Christ's merits were not sufficient.
If Christ's merits were perfect, then man's merits cannot be added unto them, for
that is perfect, to which nothing can be added: but if man's merits must be
added to them, then it follows, that Christ's were not perfect; and so no
merits at all: for this property is required in a merit, that it be perfect:
and so either they must deny the necessity of our meriting, or confess the
insufficiency of Christ: either they must acknowledge Christ's merits to be
imperfect, or ours to be unnecessary, yea none at all. I but (they will say)
Christ did not only merit the pardon of our sins, but also that our works
should be meritorious of life everlasting: and by this (sat they) are Christ's
merits more magnified then by us, because the greater the gift is, the greater
is the glory of the giver: so that our meriting does not argue any want in his
merits, but rather prove a greater efficacy to be in them: for to this end
will he have us to merit, partly that we may show our selves like unto him,
and partly to train us up in good works by this spur. All these are but
shifts, and indeed mere cauils, for first, to say, that Christ did not alone
merit for us eternal life, but also grace, that so we might merit eternal
life for our selves: what is it, but to make us our own Saviors; for all our
merits come from grace and freewill joined together, as has been shown, and
grace is nothing with them, except free will concur with it: for they teach,
that we may receive it if we will, and when we have it, we may merit, if we
will, eternal life, or else go without it. What is this (I say) but to
affirm, that a man is not saved by Christ's merits, but that by the help of
grace he does save himself by his own merits? and so they shoue Christ out
of his office, and put themselves in his room.

33. Secondly, I answer, that the efficacy of Christ's merits, is greater in
purchasing eternal life for us by himself alone, then in giving us ableness
to merit it for our selves; because it is a greater glory, and a token of
greater power, to effect a thing immediately without means, then by the
mediation or usurpation of any means whatsoever. In the former, all the honor
is to the worker, in the later there must needs be some glory ascribed to the
means, and some power attributed unto them: and therefore to say, that Christ
has only merited by himself without us eternal life for us, is to give the
entire and perfect glory unto him, and none unto our selves: and to affirm,
that he merited to make our works meritorious, is to derogate from his glory,
and to detract from the efficacy of his death and passion.

34. And here we may see the vanity of Bellarmines assertion, who to prove,
that by this doctrine of theirs, they ascribe Bell. Ibid.
more efficacy to Christ's merits then we do, brings in this similitude,
Sicut quod Deus, etc. that is, As in that God uses the Sun to lighten the
world, fire to heat it, air and rain to refresh it, is not an argument of
weakness in God, that he cannot do all these things by himself without
them, but rather of his omnipotency, in that he was not only able to do
these things himself, but also to give power to those creatures to do them:
so it is an argument of greater power in Christ's merits, to give strength to
our works to merit heaven, then if he did it for us without our works. I,
but by Bellarmines leave (that I may speak with all humble reverence to the
divine Majesty) the power of God had been more manifest, and his omnipotency
more conspicuous (I do not say had been greater) if he should do these
things immediately by himself, then it is by the glass of the creatures. As
when the Lord came down in person upon mount Sinai, and gave the children of
Israel the law from his own mouth, his glory was more famous and fearful,
then when he sent it them after by the hand of Moses, though written with his
own finger, as the other was spoken with his own mouth. And therefore it is
said, Exodus 20. that the people were so astonished at Gods voice, that they
desired, that he would speak no more unto them in his own person, but by his
servant Moses. Add hereunto, that God in his wisdom ordained those creatures
to that end and purpose, and therefore we must not dispute (as Bellarmine does)
whether it should have been a greater token of his omnipotency, if he had,
or if he had not created them; but humbly submit our selves to his wisdom,
knowing, that his thoughts are not like ours, nor his counsels like ours, Esaias
5^. 8. 9.
but as the heavens are higher then the earth, so are his ways higher than
ours, and his thought above our thoughts: but for the merits of Christ, he has
revealed in his word, that in them only we are to find salvation: and
therefore we must believe, that he is most glorified by that doctrine, which
teaches us to rely only upon them: and as for the power in them, to cause us
to merit, it is no where to be found in Scripture, and therefore not to be
thought to be for the advancement of his glory: besides, to say, that Christ's
honor is increased by man's merit, is plain blasphemy, for, who has given
any thing to God, Romans 11. 25. He stands not in need of our good Romans 11.
25. Psalm. 16. 2.
decdes, Psalm. 16. 2. Indeed, we do glorify God by our good works, but that
is not by increasing, but by publishing and proclaiming of his glory: but the
Romanists say, that the glory of Christ's merits is augmented by our merits,
which must needs be a most blasphemous speech. In a word, seeing we do not
find in Scripture, that Christ died to give merit to our works; but to
purchase pardon to our sins, and obtain life for us; we must be content to
think that this serves most for his glory, and that the contrary is
derogatory thereunto.

35. Lastly, where did we ever read, that we must be like unto Christ in
meriting? we read, that we must be holy as he is holy, and humble and meek
as he was humble and meek, and patient as he was patient; to wit, in quality,
not in quantity, in imitation, not in perfection: but to merit as he did, is no
where to be found: nay, it is a thing impossible, for it is an infinite and
omnipotent work of righteousness, that can deserve any thing at the infinite
justice of the omnipotent God, and it must be of infinite value, that can
purchase that infinite reward. And therefore it was necessary, that he which
should be our Redeemer, should also be God, because neither Angel nor
Archangell, nor any creature else could perform a work of that price, which
might be sufficient to merit the kingdom of heaven. It is therefore a most
gross blasphemy, to say, that we must be like unto Christ in the point of
meriting: for it makes every man a Jesus, that is, a Savior and Redeemer to
himself. Therefore to conclude, I say with S. Bernard, Let the glory remain
to the Lord untouched, Bern. in Cant. ser. 13.
he has triumphed over the enemy alone, he has freed the captives alone, he
has fought and conquered alone: and with S. Augustine, To whom we are endebted
for that we are, to him we August. in Psalm. 144.
are endebted, that we are justified: let none attribute to God his being, and
to himself his justifying; for it is better which thou give to thy self,
than that which thou give unto God; thou give the lower thing unto God, and
the higher to thy self, give all to him, praise him in all. This we do by
our doctrine, and they the contrary: and therefore it is most manifest, that by
this doctrine of theirs, man's glory is exalted, and Christ's defaced, man's
merits lifted up, and Christ's pulled down, which cannot stand with the truth
and sincerity of Christian Religion.

36. The fourth doctrine which tends directly to the dishonor 4.
of God, and the abasing of Christ's glory in the work of our redemption, is
their paradox of humane satisfactions: by which they teach, that Christ by his
death has made satisfaction for the guilt of our sins, and the eternal
punishment due unto them, but we our selves must satisfy the justice of God,
for the temporal punishment either in earth or in Purgatory: whereas we on the
contrary teach and believe, that by Christ's death and passion, a perfect and
all-sufficient satisfaction is made to the justice of God, for all the sins
of men, and for all the punishment thereof, both eternal and temporal. As for
our doings or sufferings, we acknowledge the one to be sabordinately required
as fruits of our faith, and the other necessary to be sustained as means of
our mortification. And touching offenses against our brethren, we hold it
necessary that we make satisfaction to such whom we have wronged any ways,
either by confession, restitution, or punishment, as the case shall require;
yea, we acknowledge that a Canonical or Ecclesiastical satisfaction is to be
made to the Church, or any part thereof, when as we have given just scandal
and offense there unto. But in all these we deny, that there is any virtue or
power to expiate our sins, or to make satisfaction to God for the punishment
thereof, either temporal or eternal; that to do, is only proper and peculiar
to the Cross of Christ: for as the disobedience of the first Adam brought upon
us not only eternal punishments, but also temporal; so the obedience and
merit of the second Adam, has made satisfaction to God for both.

37. And herein we agree both with the holy Scripture in many express places,
as 1. John 2. 2. He is the propitiation for our sins. And Romans 5. 18. For the
eternal punishment of them: And Esaias 53. 4. For the temporal; for there it is
said, that he took upon him our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses. And with
the holy Fathers; for Saint Augustine plainly affirms, That temporal
afflictions before forgiveness, are the punishments of Aug. de pe^^^^mer. and
remis. li. 2. ca. 34. Origin hom. 16. in Genesis Tert. Apol. c. 41.
sin; but after forgiveness are the fights and exercises of the just. And
Origin, That which is to the just, the exercise of virtue, is to the unjust,
the punishment of sin. And Tertullian, The plagues of the world are to one for
punishment; to the other for admonition and advertisement: and this is the very
substance of our doctrine.

38. As for our adversaries, they blush not to affirm, even Conc. Trid. ses.
4. sub. Iul. cap. 8.
the Council of Trent it self, that when God forgiueth a sinner, yet he
forgiueth not all the punishment, but leaves the party by his own works to
satisfy till it be washed away, and that the blood of Christ does not serve
to acquit us from the temporal punishment, Bell. de poeniten. lib. 4. cap. 6.
but that we must acquit our selves, either by our own works, as prayer,
alms, and fasting, etc. or by our sufferings, either in this life, or in
Purgatory. Yes, some of the chiefest of them are Greg. de Valent. to^. 4. disp.
7. q 14.
bold to avouch, that the recompense made by satisfaction, respects not only
the temporal punishment, but some part of the offense also, and the wrath of
God. And others say, That a sinner by the Caict. Soto. Suar. tom. 1. d. 4. l. 9.
grace of God may satisfy for his sin condignely, and equally, and by that
satisfaction obtain pardon. And that which is more then all the rest, some of
them affirm without blushing, that Christ by his sacrifice on the Cross
satisfied only for original sin, and not for actual after Baptism.
Bellarmine indeed is Bell. de missa. li. 2 cap. 2.
ashamed of this doctrine, as he might well be, but yet it is plainly
maintained by Gregory de Valentia. And this in brief is the dunghill of
Popish satisfactions, from whence steame forth like vapors, their Purgatory,
and Pardons, and Penance, and much more such like trumpery.

39. But let us leave them to their manifold errors, and come to the
examination of this one point, whether they or we bring more dishonor to the
Cross of Christ. And to the purpose, first, the very nature of satisfaction,
which as they affirm, is the yielding of a sufficient recompense to God for a
trespass committed, is enough to prove that their doctrine tends to the
singular impeachment of the Cross of Christ: for if Christ has made a full
and perfect satisfaction upon the Cross, as without all doubt he did, he
himself contesting in that his last speech, It is finished; then what need
any addition of humane satisfactions? If there be such a necessity of humane
satisfactions, as they make, then Christ's satisfaction must needs be imperfect,
and so no satisfaction at all: for an imperfect satisfaction is no
satisfaction, as the very word it self implies, importing a sufficient
recompense to be made to the party offended: And if it be perfect, it must be
full and absolute, that is, such as needs nothing else to be added unto it.
But they require something to be added to Christ's satisfaction; and therefore
must needs hold that it is not a full, perfect, and absolute satisfaction: for
it implies a manifest contradiction to affirm any thing to be a full and
perfect cause of it self alone, and yet to add another to it, as a joint
cause to produce the same effect.

40. But they will answer, that man's satisfaction is not to supply the want of
Christ's, but to apply it unto us, and to fulfill his will and ordinance: for
Christ's satisfaction (say they) Cost. Ench. p. 395 Bish. contra Refor. Cathal.
Bell. de poenit. li. 4. cap. 14.
is of infinite value, and might as well have taken away the temporal
punishment, as the eternal, but that God will have it otherwise, for the
mortifying of sin in us, and making us conformable to Christ our head. This
answer of theirs may seem to carry a show of sound reason, but in very deed
it is but a shift, and a golden cover to blanch the ugliness of their
doctrine, for it were odious for them to say plainly, that Christ's
satisfaction stood in need of a supply, or was any ways imperfect; and
therefore they would not have men to think so of them, though in truth they
both think and speak so of Christ, when they a little forget what they are a
doing, and by infallible consequence their doctrine concludes no less: for
plain speech thus writes Gabriel Biel, Though the passion of Biel. ca. 3. d.
19. art. 2. concl. 5.
Christ be the principal merit, for which the grace of God, and the opening of
heaven, and the glory thereof be given; yet it is neither the sole nor total
meritorious cause, but always there concurreth some work of him that
receives the grace. And Miletus, Milet. li. Discuss.
Christ indeed is the general cause of our salvation, but yet particular
causes are to be added to this, and so he is not the total and whole cause.
And Bellarmine himself by consequence Bell. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 14.
confesses as much, when he says, that a righteous man has right to the
Kingdom of heaven by a twofold title, one of the merits of Christ, another of
his own merits. These be plain speeches, and show what their meaning is: so
that howsoever they gloze over the matter with goodly words, yet it is nothing
but poison in a painted box, wherewith the ignorant may be infected, but the
skillful are able to discern their fraud. And here observe the contrariety of
Bellarmines speech to another saying of S. Bernard to the same purpose. Christ
Bernard.
(says Saint Bernard) has a double right unto the kingdom of heaven, one by
inheritance, as he is the Son of God, another by purchase, as he bought it by
his death, the first he keeps to himself, this latter he imparts to his
members. This by S. Bernards Divinity is all the right that a faithful man
has to the kingdom of heaven, by Christ's purchase: and upon this only does
that good man, and all other of Gods children rely: but Bellarmine gives him
another title, to wit, by purchase of his own merits, which as it is a strain
of his own wit: so let him keep it to himself, and make merry with it, for
we will have nothing to do with it.

41. As for that which they say, that our satisfactions serve not to supply the
want, but to apply the efficacy of Christ's unto us, is a more ridiculous and
shifting device then the other: for first, how can that be, when as sin is
first pardoned, which is by the satisfaction of Christ? and then long after
comes our satisfaction, if not in this life, yet sure in Purgatory. The
applying of a thing, is a present act, arising betwixt the agent and the
patient, therefore if our satisfaction do apply Christ's unto our souls, then
it follows, that Christ has not satisfied for our sins, till we have
satisfied for the temporal punishment of them, which is flat contrary to
their own principles. Secondly, that which applies, has relation to that
which is applied, as to the object: but our satisfaction has no relation to
Christ's satisfaction, as the object, but is only referred to the temporal
punishment, and to the justice of God, as they affirm, therefore it cannot
apply it unto us. And lastly, how dissonant is it unto reason, that a
satisfaction should apply a satisfaction, as if one medicine should apply
another to the patient. It is the hand that applies the medicine, and not
another medicine: so it is faith that applies Christ's satisfaction unto our
sins, and not our satisfaction. Nay, except the merits of Christ be applied
to our best works and sufferings, they cannot stand before Gods justice,
neither can they be meritorious, as they themselves confess: so that it will
follow by this doctrine, that our satisfactions are both the hand to apply
Christ's, and the thing to which it is applied. All which is most repugnant, not
only to Religion, but even to reason it self.

42. Lastly, when as Bellarmine affirms, that ad maiorem, Bell. de Purgat.
lib. 1. cap. 10.
etc. that is, for the greater glory of God who is satisfied, and the greater
honor of man satisfying, it pleased Christ to join his satisfaction to ours:
He plainly discovers the scope of their doctrine, to be the advancement of
the dignity of man; whereunto indeed he joins the glory of God (for else all
men would cry fie upon such a Religion:) but yet it both detracteth greatly
from the glory of God, in ascribing some dignity unto man, and peruerteth the
true end of the Gospel, which is not the partial, but the entire honor and
glory of God: For, as S. Paul says, Gods power is most clearly seen in our
weakness, 1. Cor. 12. 9. Dan. 1. 7.
and his righteousness in the confession of our shame, and his glory in our
baseness and vileness, that no flesh might rejoice in his presence, but that he
only might be exalted at that day. But by this 1. Cor. 1. 29.
Romish doctrine, every just man may rejoice in his own dignity, and may lift
up himself in the presence of God; as if he were the joint cause of his own
salvation together with Christ, and that Christ's satisfaction had been nothing
available to him, except he had applied it to himself by his own
satisfaction.

43. Thus they divide salvation, as it were party parpale betwixt Christ and
man, and parallel them together. And whereas they say, that we must be like
unto Christ, as in meriting, so in satisfying; what do they but intrude man
into the fellowship of Christ's office? for our imitation of Christ stands in
a conformity to his conversation and life, and of those things only which
concern his person, and are imitable, but not in being like unto him in his
office: and therefore when they say, that we must be like unto Christ in
satisfying, they make every man that is saved, a Jesus and Savior to himself,
because they make him to imitate him in those things, wherein consists his
being our Christ. Then which, what can be more contrary to the honor of Christ?

44. These be the four principal points, whereby the glory of Gods mercy,
and Christ's merits, and the holy Ghosts grace is greatly defaced, and in stead
thereof, man's nature and merits exalted. Besides these, there are diverse other
doctrines of the Church of Rome, which bring forth the same fruit, some of
which, I will only name, and so conclude this th^^^ argument. And first, by
the doctrine of the Popes supremacy, they detract from the power of Christ,
and consequently from his glory: for both they endow the Pope with those
titles, which properly belong to Christ, as to be the Father Bell. de Council.
lib. 2. cap. 17.
in Gods family, the universal Pastor, the head of the Church, the husband and
bridegroom of it: and all other names which are given to our Savior Christ in
holy Scripture (whereby it is shown, that he is above the Church:) and also
they attribute the same power to the Pope, which belongs properly to Christ,
as to pardon sin, to dispense with the law of God, to open and shut the gates
of heaven, not ministerially, but absolutely and iudicially, to depose Kings,
and to dispose of Kingdoms, and such like. Now, what a dishonor is this to
him, in whose thigh is written this glorious title, The King of Kings? He must
not be the only head of the Church, but the Pope must be a joint head with
him, nor he the sole Governor, but the Pope must be his Vicar: nor the sole
husband of the Church, but the Pope, in his absence, must be her husband in his
room. Could a mortal man endure this injury? And do we think that the
Son of God will bear it? Either Christ is not able to govern alone, or not
willing; they will not say not able, lest their blasphemy should be too too
odious: and if they say, not willing: how can he not be willing to maintain
his own glory, or not be unwilling to be confederated with a sinful Pope
(for so often they are) in the disposition of his Kingdom? Let them make the
best that they can of it: yet it appears, that Christ's government is divided
betwixt the Pope and him, and so must the glory also needs be divided,

45. Secondly, by their doctrine of the Invocation and Intercession of Saints,
what do they but divide the office, and so the glory of the Mediatour-ship,
betwixt Christ and them? for they teach that Christ is our Mediator of
Redemption, but the Saints Mediators of Intercession, whereas we with the
Scripture make Christ Jesus to be the only and sole Mediator both of
Redemption and Intercession. We honor the Saints, but we pray unto God alone
in the name of his Son; they adore the Saints, and make their prayers unto
them as well as unto God: yea, more prayers do they power out by numbers unto
them, then unto God. What is to dishonor God and Christ, if this be not?

46. Thirdly, by their doctrine of traditions, they derogate greatly from the
glory of Gods mercy toward his Church: for they hold that the written word is
not sufficient for a Christian man to salvation, without the help of
Ecclesiastical traditions: whereby they plainly insinuate, that either God
had not that care of his family the Church, as he might have had, seeing he
left not for it a perfect and certain rule for the government thereof, but
sent it over to uncertain traditions; or that wisdom which all Law-giuers
labor to attain unto, seeing he could not at the first provide for all
future occasions; or that love that he would not: one of these does necessarily
follow from their doctrine.

47. Lastly, by their doctrine of worshipping of Images, whereby they give unto
stocks and stones part of that religious worship which is due unto God. We
teach that all religious worship is due unto God alone. They on the contrary
maintain, that latria, that is, divine worship is Gods due; but dulia, that
is, service is to be given to Images. Yea, that the Crucifixe is to be
worshipped with divine worship, which is due only to God. Who sees not what
manifest injury they offer to Gods glory, by this superstitious worship of
dumb and dead Images?

48. And thus, omitting many other like points which might be inserted in this
place, I hope that the Minor proposition is sufficiently demonstrated, that the
Church of Rome does by many doctrines derogate from the glory of God, and the
merits of Christ. And therefore the conclusion must needs follow, being built
upon an immovable foundation, that, that Religion which maintains such
doctrines, is not the truth of Christ, but the seduction of Antichrist.

MOTIVE. V. That Religion deserves to be suspected, which refuses to be tried
by the Scriptures, as the perfect and alone rule of faith, and will be judged
and tried by none but it self: But such is the Religion of the Church of Rome:
Ergo.
THe first proposition in this Argument, though it be most MAYOR.
true, and cannot without any show of reason be contradicted: yet that it may
be without all doubt and exception, it shall not be amiss to strengthen the
same by sound and evident proofs, derived both out of Gods word, and consent
of ancient Fathers. The Proposition consists of two parts, first, that it
cannot be the true Religion, which will not abide the alone trial of the
Scriptures. Secondly, that it will be judged and tried by none but it self;
let us consider of both these severally.

2. And concerning the first, if the Scripture be the fountain of all true
religion, the foundation and basis of our faith, the Canon and rule of all the
doctrines of faith, and the touchstone to try truth from falsehood, then to
refuse to be judged and tried by the Scriptures alone, is, plainly to discover
that there is something in it which issued not from that fountain, which is not
built upon that foundation, which is so oblique and crooked, that it dares not
to be applied to that rule, and which is counterfeit, and dares not abide the
touchstone. Now that the Scripture is such, as I have said, let the Holy Ghost,
speaking in the Scripture, bear witness, Search Ioh. 5. 39.
the Scripture (says our Savior) for in them you think to have eternal
life, and they be they which testify of me: therefore the Scripture is the
fountain of all true religion: for, what is the Religion of Christians, but
the right knowledge of Christ Jesus? This caused Saint Paul to say, I desire to
know 1. Cor. 2. 2.
nothing, but Christ Jesus, and him crucified. Again, the Scriptures are able
to make us wise unto salvation, through faith in 2. Tim. 3. 15.
Christ Jesus: and are profitable to teach, to improve, to correct, and to
instruct in righteousness, that the man of God may be absolute, and perfect to
every good work. Therefore the Scripture is the only fountain of true
Religion: for what is true Religion, but spiritual wisdom and holy
perfection, the one in contemplation, the other in action, the one in
knowledge, the other in practice: for these (...)
two joined together, do make a man truly religious, but the Scriptures afford
both, as it is clear in that saying of S. Paul, and may be confirmed by
another like speech of Solomon, who affirms, that the commandments Pro 2. 9.
of God will make a man to understand righteousness, and judgment, and
equity, and every good path. Righteousness and judgment pertain to
knowledge, equity, and every good path belong to practice. And for this cause,
Origin compares the Scriptures to Jacobs Well, from whence not only Jacob,
Orig. in Mat. 4.
and his sons, that is, the learned and the skillful, but his sheep and
cattle, that is, the simple and ignorant do drink, that is, derive unto
themselves the waters of life and salvation: and therefore where the knowledge
of the Scriptures flourished not, as among all the Heathen, both Romans,
Grecians, and Barbarians before their conversion, there no true Religion showed
it self, but their Religion was all false and deuillish: for, in stead of the
true God, they worshipped dumb creatures, and mortal men: yea, devils
themselves, as Lactantius Lactant. de falsa Relig.
shows. All which proceeded from hence, that they had not the word of God for
their guide, which is the only fountain and wellspring of true Religion.

3. Again, as it is the fountain from whence, so it is the foundation upon
which our faith relieth, whether we take faith for the act of believing, or
for the matter and object of our belief. Ye are built (says S. Paul) upon the
foundation of Ephesians. 2, 19. 20.
the Prophets, and Apostles, Christ Jesus himself, being the chief corner
stone. By the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, is meant the
Prophetical and Apostolical doctrine, as all Expositours that I have read;
yea, their own Aquinas and Caietane, Aquin. Caietan.
with one consent avouch: and to be built upon this foundation, is to have our
faith to rely and depend upon it only, as a house relyeth only upon the
foundation, and without a foundation cannot stand: that therefore is no
doctrine of faith, that is vpholden by any other foundation, neither has that
any good foundation, which is not built upon the Prophetical and Apostolical
doctrine; they build upon sand, that build upon humane traditions, every stormy
puff of wind will shake the house of that faith: but they which hear the
word of Christ, and keep it, build upon a rock, against Math. 7. 23.
which, neither the rain, floods, nor winds, no not the gates of hell are
able to prevail; because they are grounded upon the rock: which rock indeed
is Christ, to speak properly, as 1. Pet. 2. 7.
not only S. Peter confesses, 1. Pet. 2. 7. but even Christ himself, that is
this rock: Math. 16. 18. when he says, Upon Math. 16. 18.
this rock will I build my Church: that is upon this truth, that Christ is the
Son of God: yet the word of Christ may also be called the rock, because it
is as firm and durable as Christ himself. And that we may know, that Gods
word 1. Pet. 1. 25.
only is the foundation of faith, S. Paul tells us plainly, that faith is
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. If any Romans 10. 17.
of them say (as they do) that the word of God is not only that which is
written in Scripture, but that which is unwritten, delivered by tradition: let
them show as good reasons, to prove their traditions to be the word of God, as
we do to prove the Scripture, and we will believe them: but since they cannot,
let them bear with us, if we understand the Apostles words, as spoken only
touching the written word, and the rather, because we have for the warrantize
of our interpretation, both S. Paul himself in the same Chapter, verse 8. when
he says, This is the word offaith which we preach. Where he Romans 10. 8.
shows what is that word, which is the ground of our faith, namely, the word
preached. And S. Peter, who having magnified 1. Pet. 1. 25.
the word of God, with this commendation, that it endures for ever, presently
expounds himself of what word he spoke, saying, And this is that word which
is preached amongst you: That is, the word of the Gospel, which was not in
part, but wholly and fully, as preached by mouth, so committed to writing. And
thus S. Basil also interprets it, Basil in (...).
for he says, Quicquid est vltra scripturas: Whatsoever is out of the
Scriptures divinely inspired, because it is not of faith, is sin: for faith
is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Now from hence thus I reason. If
the word of God written, be the only ground of faith, then that Religion which
will not acknowledge it, dependence only upon the word written, is not to be
believed, but to be suspected as erroneous: but the word written is the only
ground of faith, as has been proved: therefore that Religion which
disclaymeth it dependence only upon the word, deserves justly not to be
believed, but to be suspected as erroneous: And in this regard, the Romish
Religion, though it be in our Pater noster, to wit, under the last petition,
Deliver us from evil, yet it should never come into our Creed, to repose our
faith and our salvation upon it.

4. Thirdly, the Scripture, as it is the fountain and foundation of true
Religion: So it is the rule of faith, and the touchstone of doctrines, and the
balance of the Sanctuary, to weigh truth and falsehood in, that the one may be
discerned from the other. This the Prophet Esaias teaches, when he Esaias 8. 20.
calls us to the Law and to the Testimony, saying, that if any speak not
according to that word, there is no light in them. From which place thus I
reason: that whereunto we must resort in all controversies, and doubts for
resolution, that is, the rule of faith: but such is the Scripture, by the
testimony of the Prophet: therefore the Scripture is the rule of faith. In
like manner, we may conclude, out of S. Peter, who says, that We 2. Pet. ^. 19.
have a more sure word of the Prophets, whereunto we must take heed, as unto
a light that shines in a dark place, till the Daystarre arise in our hearts.
If the word of the Prophets was a sure direction to the Church of God, before
the Gospel was written; then much more is the whole Scripture, containing the
word of the Prophets and of the Apostles together; but S. Peter affirms the
first, therefore the second must needs follow. For this cause when one asked
our Savior, what he might do to be saved, he referred him to the Scripture
for his direction, What is written, how read thou? And so Abraham Luke 10.
26.
refers the rich gluttons brethren, to Moses, and Luke 16. 29.
the Prophets: and Christ tells the Saduces, that this was the cause of their
error, because they knew not the Scriptures. Out Math 22. 29.
of all which Texts, thus I argue, If there were any other rule of faith,
besides the sacred Scripture, our Savior, and Saint Peter would never have
sent us over to the Scripture alone, but would have poynted out unto us some
other means: but they send us to the Scripture alone: and therefore that alone
is the rule and balance of our faith.

5. And this the very title and inscription of the Scripture does intimate: for
why is it called Canonical, but because it contains the Canon, that is, the
rule of faith and life? The Fathers with one consent agree in this truth. Saint
Basil calls Basil lib. 1. contr. Eunom. Chrysostom. hom. 13 in 2. Coloss. Aug. de
Baptist. contr. Donatist. lib. 2. cap. 6.
the Scripture, Canonem recti, and normam veritatis, The Canon of right, and
the rule of truth. Chrysostom says, that Assertio diuinarum legum, etc. The
assertion of the law of God is a most exact Balance, Squire, and Rule. Saint
Augustine calls it Statera diuina, Gods balance, or a divine balance: these
be his words, Non afferamus stateras dolosas: Let us not bring deceitful
balances to weigh what we will and how we will, saying, This is heavy, that
is light: but let us bring that divine balance out of the holy Scriptures, as
it were out of the Lords treasury, and by it weigh all things, or rather
acknowledge them, being Tertul. contra Hermog. Greg. Nyss. orat. deijs qui
adeunt Hierosol. Great. Decret.
weighed by the Lord. Tertullian gives to the Scripture the same name: so does
Gregory Nyssen: and our Countriman venerable Bede, to pass over all the rest,
as he is reported by Gratian in his decrees, tells us in most plain terms,
that In sacris literis vnica est credendi, pariter and viuendi regula
praescripta: The only rule both of Faith, and Life, is prescribed unto us in
the holy Scriptures. Now, if this be so, as it is mere madness to affirm the
contrary, then that religion which does refuse to be tried by this rule, and to
be weighed in this balance, does give just cause of suspicion, that it is but
light stuff, and crooked ware.

6. If a man should offer to his creditor a piece of gold for payment, and
should refuse to have it either tried by the touchstone, or weighed in the
balance, he might justly suspect that it was but either light, or counterfeit:
so may any of good sense rightly suspect that religion to be both light, and
counterfeit, which refuses to be examined by the rule of Gods word, especially
(which is the second branch of the first proposition) if it not only refuse to
be tried by the Scripture, but also will admit no trial, nor Judge but it
self: for as by reason we conclude, that such a man has an evil cause in
hand, who in Westminster Hall refuses to have his matter tried by the law, and
will admit no Judge, but his own opinion: and that man to be guilty, which
standing at the bar of justice, accused of some great crime, denies to be
tried by the verdict of his Country, according to the law: so likewise, the
cause of Religion being called in question, that must needs in any equal
judgment be deemed unsound and guilty, which will not stand to the verdict
and sentence of the Prophets and Apostles, who are the Jury to try all cases
of conscience: and of the Spirit of God speaking in the Scripture, who is the
only Judge to hear and determine all questions of doubt which may arise in
matters of faith, and will be censured and judged by none but it self.

7. Against this truth, all the Romanists, and especially the Jesuits; and of
the Jesuits, chiefly Bellarmine, conflict and fight with foot and horse,
sails and oars, tooth and nail, and all they can do: for herein lies the
very blood and life of their Religion. And if this be wrung from them, that
the Scripture is the only judge and rule of faith, Actum est de regno
Pontificio, The Romish kingdom goes to wrack utterly: and therefore they
mainely contend to prove, first, that the Scripture is not the Judge of
controversies; secondly, that it is not properly the rule of faith; and if it
be a Judge, it is a dumb one that cannot speak, and if it be a Rule, it is a
partial and imperfect one, not total and absolute.

8. These two positions Bellarmine labors to prove by Bell. de verbo Dei
interp. li. 3.
many sorts of Arguments: first, from testimonies of the Old Testament;
secondly, from testimonies of the New; thirdly, by the authority of Bishops and
Emperors; fourthly, by the witness of the Fathers; and lastly by reason. I
pass over the four first sorts of Arguments, as being sufficiently answered
by others, and come to the last, which are derived from reason, the slightness
whereof does plainly discover the vanity of this their opinion. Now, to prove
that the Scripture cannot Bell. ibid. ca. 9.
be the judge of Controversies, nor the Interpreter of it self, they use three
chief reasons: first, because it has diverse senses: secondly, because it is
not able to speak, but is mute and dumb; and thirdly, because in every well
ordered Commonwealth, the Law and the Judge are distinguished; and therefore,
seeing the Scripture is the law, therefore it cannot be the Judge.

9. I answer to the first, that it is not only false, but impious to affirm,
that the Scripture is as it were, A nose of wax flexible into many senses, as
Melchior Canus affirms, or that Can. loc. li. 3. c. 2.
it may be dinersly expounded according to the occasion of the time, as
Cardinal Cusanus auerreth: or that it is like a Delphian Cus. ep. 2. 3. 7.
Tur. contra Sad. page 99.
Sword, to be converted into many senses, as Turrian the Jesuit makes it: for
as of one body there is but one soul, so of one place of Scripture, there is
but one true and sound sense, which is the soul and life of it, the words
being but the flesh, and the skin that covers the same: and that true sense
is that which the Spirit of God intends, and not that which every private
spirit collecteth and deduceth out of the same: as for the Tropologicall,
Anagogicall, and Allegorical senses, they are not distinct senses of the
Scripture, but diverse collections and applications issuing out of one and the
same sense: all which may be intended by the Holy Ghost, under that one
literal sense. For example, when an Allegory is deduced out of a place of
Scripture, as Saint Paul, Gal. 4. 24. Gal. 4. 24.
does allegorize that History of Abraham's two Wives, it is not a double
interpretation of that History: but it is only an Allegorical application of
it, to the illustrating of the matter which he had in hand: and so when by a
tropologie a moral doctrine is derived out of a text of Scripture, as our
Savior does, Math. 12. 41. 42. applying to the Jews the Mat. 12. 41. 42.
repentance of the Ninevites, and the long journey of the Queen of Saba to
see, and hear Solomon; or when as by a type any thing in Scripture is
mystically expounded otherwise then the literal sense does bear: this is not
a new sense, but an accommodation of the right sense to another purpose, which
notwithstanding is intended by the spirit of God: and this is confessed by
diverse of their own side. Cornelius Agrippa Agrip. de vanit. cap. 100. Aquin.
Sum. pri. par. 9. pri. par. 10
thus writes, The Scripture has but one simple and constant sense, in which
alone, the truth is found. And Aquinas thus, It is the literal sense which the
author of the Scripture intends, which is God: yet it is not inconvenient, if
in one letter of the Scripture, according to the literal sense, there be many
senses.

10. But grant that there are diverse distinct senses of some few places of
Scripture: to wit, one literal, and another spiritual, (for in the most there
is not) yet there can be but one literal sense, as many of the Jesuits
themselves confess, and Acost. lib. 3. de Cor. Revel. ca. 11. Medina. Rib.
com. in hos. ca. 11. nu. 6. 7. Bell. de verbo Dei, li. 3. ca. 3. Veg. de Just.
li. 9 cap. 44. Sal. com. in Heb. dis. 1. 7. Azor. Instit. mor. lib. 8. cap. 2.
Sixth. Sen. Bibl. li. 3. pa. 140. Pol. Virg. de Invent. li. 4. c. 9.
from that only, a forcible argument may be drawn, as Bellarmine
acknowledges, and Vega another Jesuit: except the mystical sense be
explaned, and authorized by some other express place of Scripture, as
Salmeron, Azorius, Sixtus Senensis, and Polidore Virgil avouch, and prove the
same by the testimony of Augustine and Jerome. Now then, why should the
multiplicity of senses bar the Scripture, from being the Judge of
controversies, seeing no controversy can effectually be decided by any other
sense, but by the literal, which is ever one and the same: or by the
mystical, so far forth as it is approved and declared by another Scripture,
which then becomes the literal sense of that place, wherein it is expounded,
though it was spiritually included in the bark of the former from whence it
was derived? This therefore is a most vain and frivolous objection.

11. To the second, that the Scripture is dumb, and therefore cannot be the
Judge, because the Judge of controversies, must have a deciding and determining
voice. I answer, that this is blasphemy against the sacred word of God: for if
the Scripture be an Epistle of the omnipotent God to his creature, as Gregory
calls it, what does it but speak to them to Gregor. mag. Epist. 40.
whom it is sent? He that writes a letter to his friend, does he not speak
unto him? and he that reads his friends letter, does he not understand his
meaning and intendment, because the letter does not utter a voice, and he
hears not his friend himself? Does not every man know that there is a double
word, verbum dictum, a word spoken, and verbum scriptum, a word written, the
one being Imago cordis, the Image of the mind, the other Imago oris, the Image
of the speech? True it is, the Scripture does not speak, as man speaks, but
yet it speaks as the Law uses to speak: and God himself speaks in the
Scripture, to them that have ears to hear him, and therefore in the Epistles
to the Churches, which were all written, not spoken, it is said, Let him Reave.
2. and 3.
that has an ear, hear what the Spirit says unto the Churches; and is there
any thing more common then these phrases, what says the Scripture? does not
the Scripture say? Yea, and is not the Scripture called vi^us Dei sermo, the
lively word of God? Heb. 4. 12.
Heb. 4. 12. how can it speak, if it be dumb; how can it give life, if it be
dead?

12. This manifest truth Stapleton strives to elude by a Stapl. lib. 1. cont.
Whitak. c. 7.. 9.
witty, as he thinks, but indeed a witless distinction, God (says he)
speaks indeed by the Scripture, but he speaks not unto us by them: the
Scripture is indeed the word of God: but the Church is the voice of God. Which
fond objection our famous Whitak. contra Staplet.
Countryman the scourge of Popery, Doctor Whitaker thus wipeth away. If God
speak in the Scripture, then he does it either with himself, or unto some
other, but not with himself, therefore to some other, and if to some other, to
whom but unto man? for he neither speaks to Angels nor Devils, nor dumb
creatures, therefore only to man, as when he says, Thou shall not kill, or,
Love your enemies: there is no man so simple, but he perceives that God
speaks unto man. And therefore the Apostle says, that whatsoever things Romans
15. 4.
are written aforetime, are written for our learning, that we through patience
and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope: And so it is clear, that God
by the Scripture, not only speaks, but speaks unto us, and so the
Scripture is not only the word of God, but the voice of God: in it self, as
it proceeded from God, the voice of God; to us, as we have it by writing, the
word of God, and the Epistle of the great King, to his poor subjects, whereby
they are informed of his will and pleasure, and directed in the ways of
salvation.

13. I, but when the question is about the sense of a Text, as of that, Math.
16. 19. To thee will I give the keys, etc. Which Math. 16. 19.
words they interpret, as spoken to Peter only, and consequently to the Pope
his successor: we to the rest of the Apostles, as well as to him. Where now
does the Scripture decide this doubt, and speak plainly which is the truest
sense? Mary first, in the very place it self, by the due examination of the
circumstances thereof, they evidently show that our sense is the truest: for
whereas the question is propounded to all the Apostles, verse 15. and all the
Apostles held the same faith, that Jesus is the Son of God, verse 20. it must
needs be, that Peter was but as the foreman of the Quest, and answered not
for himself only, but for them all: thereby showing forth not any preeminence
of authority above the rest, but a greater zeal and forwardness then the
rest. And hereupon it follows, that seeing this promise of the keys is made,
because of that faith and confession, therefore they all believing and
confessing the same, have an interest to the promise as well as Peter. And this
Anselmus in plain terms affirms. It is to be noted (says he) that this
power was not given Anselm. in Mat. 16.
alone to Peter: but as Peter answered one for all, so in Peter he gave this
power to all.

14. Secondly, by the conference of another place, which is more plain, to
wit, Ioh. 20. 23. where is a gift and an endowment Ioh. 20. 23.
of that power of the keys, which before was promised: for to bind, and to
loose, and to remit, and retain sins, is all one in effect, as Bellarmine
himself confesses, and contain^ the whole virtue of the keys: now here they
Bell. de Romans Pont. li. 1. ca. 12.
are all invested with equal jurisdiction, the Holy Ghost is equally breathed
upon them all, and equal authority be queathed unto them all by these words of
the Commission, As my Father sent me, so I send you: which exposition is
confirmed Aug. de verbo Dei ser. 13. Cypr. de unit. Eccles. Hierom. aduer.
Iouin. l* 1. Theoph. in Mat. 16. Ansel. in Mat. 16
by the authority of most of the Fathers, as Augustine, Cyprian, Hierome,
Theophilact, Anselme, etc. and thus the Scripture by a most lively voice
determines this doubt: and as of this, so of all other questions and
interpretations, the Scripture only must be the Judge, which by searching the
originals, examination of circumstances, conference of other places, and
consulting with the learned Fathers and Expo^itors, together with fervent
prayer to God for inward illumination, will give a most exact, and precise
satisfaction to all controversies, touching matters of ^aith, necessary to be
believed.

15. To the third reason, that the Scripture is the law, and therefore cannot
be the Judge: I answer, that though the Law and the Judge be diverse distinct
things, yet they are subordinate one unto the other, and so may both join in
the concurrence of one cause: as when our Savior says, Call no Mat. 23. 9.
man Father upon earth, for there is but one, your Father which is in heaven:
his meaning is not to exclude earthly Fathers from their title, but to show
that God is the primer and principal Father, both in respect of time, order,
and cause, and that the other are but subordinate unto him: so in a
Commonwealth the Judge is subordinate unto the law, and the law is the Judges
Judge: and for that cause, as the Law is said to be a dumb Magistrate, so the
Magistrate is said to be a speaking Law: and so in truth the Law is the Judge
primarily, and principally, and the Magistrate is but the Minister of the law,
and the Judge subordinate. Now if this be so in a Commonwealth governed by
humane Laws, which are failing and imperfect in many things, being the
ordinances of erring men, how much more may we deem it to be so in the Church
of God, whose Lawgiver is God himself, and the law the word of God? and
therefore, though the Pastors and Ministers of the Church may interpret the
Scriptures, yet they must be tied to this rule, to do it by the Scriptures,
and to expound the law by the law: for shall not a temporal Judge give
sentence out of his own brain, but secundum leges and statuta, according to
the laws and statutes of the Realm? And shall any Pastor of the Church, be
it the Pope himself, give judgment in any question out of his own breast,
without the direction of Gods word? This is to prefer humane laws before
Gods law: and to make the state of the Church far inferior to the state
politic: and to have a more certain rule for the deciding of civil
controversies, then for the determining of questions of ^aith: so that in a
word, the Scripture is both the law and the interpreter of the Law, the Judge,
and the Judgment.

16. Secondly, Bellarmine affirms and labors to prove ^^ll. de verbo Dei
li. 4. ca. 12.
that the proper and chief end of the Scripture was not to be the rule of
faith, but that it might be commonitorium quoddam vtile, A certain profitable
commonitory, whereby the doctrine delivered by word of mouth, might be
conserved and nourished. And to this end and purpose, he uses diverse reasons,
as first, because it contains in it many things which are not necessary to
faith, as all the Histories of the Old Testament, and many of the New, and the
salutations in the Epistles of the Apostles; all which were not therefore
committed to writing, because they were necessary to be believed, but are
therefore necessarily believed, because they are written. Secondly, because all
things necessary to be believed are not contained in the Scripture, as by what
means women under the law were cleansed from original sin, wanting
circumcision, and children that dyed before the eight day, and many Gentiles
that were saved: again, which are the books of Canonical Scripture, and that
these are Canonical, and those are not: that the Virgin Marie was a perpetual
virgin, that the Passover is to be kept upon the Sunday being the Lords day,
and that children of believing Parents are to be baptized, and such like.
Thirdly, because the Scripture is not one continued body, as a rule should be,
but contains diverse works, Histories, Sermons, Prophecies, Verses, and
Epistles. These be his three reasons, by which the Jesuit would euince, that
the Scripture is not given to this end, to be the rule of faith.

17. To all which I will answer briefly, and distinctly, and first in
general, secondly in particular: In general, if the Scripture be not given to
be the rule of faith, why is it called Canonical? It is therefore called
Canonical, because it contains the Canon, that is, the rule of faith and
life: this very inscription approved by all, does refute Bellarmines fond
cauillation. Again, if the Scripture was not given to be the rule, but only
a monitorie, why were there so many Books written, seeing fewer would have
served for monition? The multiplicity of Books proves, that they serve not
only to put us in mind of our duty, but also as an exact rule to square our
faith, and frame our life by. And lastly, if the Scripture was not given to be
a rule, why does he himself confess afterward that it is indeed a rule, but
not a total and entire rule, but a partial and imperfect one? If it be any
ways a rule, then it was given by God, and written by the men of God, to that
end to be the rule. And so Bellarmines goodly reasons hang together like a
sick man's dream, the one part whereof overthrows the other.

18. But to answer in particular to them severally: To the first, I say, that
it is not far from blasphemy to affirm, that there is any thing in holy
Scripture that is unnecessary; for though all things are not of equal
necessity and profit, yet there is nothing in the whole Book of God, from the
beginning of Genesis to the end of the Revel. but may have most profitable and
necessary use in the Church of God, if not for the essential form of faith,
yet for the adorning and beautifying of it: and this may truly be verified,
even of those things which he excepteth against, to wit, the Histories of the
Old and New Testament, and the salutations in the Epistles of the Apostles:
out of all which, how many excellent doctrines may be derived both for the
confirmation of faith, and edification of manners! And therefore as in man's
body, God by nature has not disposed all parts to be alike necessary, but some
have no other use but ornament and comeliness: so has Almighty God mingled
the parts of holy Scripture in that manner, that some are as it were bones and
sinews to our faith, some flesh and blood, and some again but exterior
beauty and fashion: yet as in nature nothing is made in vain, so much less
in Scripture is there any thing to be accounted superfluous and redundant: nay,
in this divine body, there are no excrements that may be cast out and
separated, as it fares in our earthly carkases, but all is entire, sound and
perfect, as the Prophet David teaches, Psalm. 19. 7. when he Psalm. 19. 7.
says, that the Law of God is perfect, converting the soul: and our Savior,
Math. 5. 18. when he avouches, that till heaven Math. 5. 18.
and earth perish one jot or title of the Law shall not, etc.

19. To his second reason I answer three things: first, that it is entirely
false, that the Scripture does not contain all things necessarily required to
the Essence of faith; for if the Scripture be perfect, and gives wisdom to
the simple; if nothing Psalm. 19. 7. Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Gal. 1. 8.
may be added to it, nor taken from it; if to teach any thing, besides the
Scripture, deserves the fearful Anathema; if it be able to make the man of
God perfect to every good work; 2. Tim. 3. 16. 17. Ioh. 5. 39. Ephesians. 2. 19.
20. Romans 15. 4.
if in them only we may find eternal life; if the Church of God be built
upon the foundation of the Prophets, and Apostles: and lastly, if our faith and
hope do arise from the Scriptures, then there is nothing necessary to
salvation, but is fully and plenarily contained in them: but the first is true,
as appears by all those testimonies before alleged, and therefore the latter
must by necessary consequence be true also.

20. Secondly, I answer, that Bellarmine by that assertion crosses the whole
stream of the Fathers, for most of them affirm the flat contrary. Tertullian
says, that when we once believe Tertul. de praescript.
the Gospel: Hoc prius credimus non esse quod vltra credere debemus: This we
believe first, that there is nothing besides which we ought to believe.
Iraeneus says, that the Apostles committed Iraen (...). haeres. lib. 3. c. 1.
to writing the Gospel which they preached, Fundamentum and columnam fidei
nostrae futurum, To be the foundation, and pillar of our faith. Basil says,
Quicquid extra diuinam scripturam Basil. Ethic. Reg. 80.
est, cum ex fide non sit, peccatum est, Whatsoever is beside the holy
Scripture, because it is not of faith, is sin: Cyrill says, that all Cyril.
in Ioh. lib. 12. cap. 68.
those things were written in holy Scripture, which the Writers thought
sufficient, Tam ad mores quam ad dogmata, As well touching conversation, as
doctrine. Augustine says, that those August. in Johan. tract. 49.
things were chosen out to be written, Quae saluti credentium sufficere
videbantur, Which seemed sufficient for the salvation of them that believe. And
again, he says in another place, Whether Aug. contr. lit. Petil. l. 4. c. 6.
concerning Christ, or concerning the Church of Christ, or concerning any thing
that pertains to our faith or life: we will not say if we, but if an Angel
from heaven shall preach unto you, but what ye have received in the Scriptures
of the Law, and the Gospel, let him be accursed. Chrysostom says, Si quis
eorum: Chrysostom. de sanct. et adoran. spir. Hier. in Mat. 23.
If any of them who are said to have the holy Ghost, do speak any thing of
him self, and not out of the Gospel, believe it not. Jerome speaking of an
opinion touching the death of Zacharias, the father of John Baptist, says, Hoc
quia ex Scripturis non habet authoritatem, This, because it has not authority,
out of the Scriptures is as easily contemned as approved. I supersede for
breuity sake, the residue of the Fathers, who with full consent conspire in the
same opinion: yea, not only the Fathers, but many also of their own most
learned Authors: as Thomas Aquinas, Aquin. lec. 1. in 1. Tim. 6. Anton. sum
part. 3. tit. 18. c. 3.. 3 Durand. praefat. in Sent. Peers. de rat. con. lib.
2. c. 19. Cling. loc. lib. 3. cap. 19. p. 198.
Antoninus, Durandus, Peresius, Clingius, and diverse others: by all which we
may see how little reckoning Bellarmine makes of the ancient Fathers: where
they make for him, he magnifieth and exalts them to the skies, but when they
are opposite to him, he rejects them as dross, and the like account he
makes of his own Doctors.

21. Lastly, I answer, that of those things which he affirms, not to be
contained in holy Scripture, and yet to be of necessity of belief, some of
them are far from either necessity or profit, as that of the means whereby
women under the Law were purged from original sin: and how the Gentiles were
partakers of the covenant, having not the Sacrament; and that Easter is to be
celebrated upon the Lords day: If these things be of that necessity of belief,
which he makes them, how many thousand then have sinned greatly, in being
ignorant thereof? for at this day not the hundredth part of Christians ever
heard these things once named, and yet by this ignorance they neither offended
God, nor hindered their own salvation. And what shall we think of Iraeneus,
Eusebius. lib. 5. cap. 25. Sozom. lib. 7. cap. 19.
and other godly Bishops in the East, that held that Easter was not to be
celebrated ever upon the Lords day? Again, the other things nominated by him,
as that the books of the sacred Bible, are the Canonical Scripture, and the
word of the living God: that the children of believing parents are to be
baptized: that Christ descended into hell, may easily be proved out of
Scripture, either by express testimony, or by necessary consequence and
deduction, which is all one; for, Perinde sunt ^a quae ex Scripturis
colliguntur, atque ^a Nazian. de Theol. lib. 5.
quae scribuntur, etc. says Nazianzene.

22. Thirdly, being driven by the power of truth, to acknowledge the Scripture
to be a rule, he comes in with a leaden distinction: to wit, that is not a
total, but a partial rule, and that the word of God written, and not written
(by (...)
this last meaning traditions) is the total and perfect rule. To this I
answer in a word, that by this distinction, he plainly ouerturneth that which
before he had confessed: for if it be the rule of faith, then it must needs
be total and perfect, if it be not total and perfect, then is it not the
rule: for a rule must be proportioned to the thing, whereunto it is applied. If
then our faith be either longer and larger then the Scripture, then cannot the
Scripture be any ways called the rule thereof. Besides, as Theophilact says,
Regula et amussis neque appositionem Theophil in 3. cap. ad Philip.
habet, neque ablationem: A rule does neither admit addition nor diminution:
and that is the definition of a rule according to Varinus. Regula est mensura
quae non fallit, quaeque nullam vel Varinus.
additionem vel detractionem admittit. A rule is (says he) a measure which
deceives not, and which admits no addition nor detraction. Therefore if it
be the rule of faith, either it is perfect, and absolute, or none at all: if it
stands in need of traditions to supply it want, then why does he call it
the rule, and why do all the Fathers give it the same name? and why has it
that inscription in the forehead, the Canonical Scripture? Lastly, if God
would give us a rule for our faith and life in the Scripture, then by the same
reason he would make that a perfect rule: for, shall any imperfect thing
proceed from the author of all perfection? When an imperfect creature is
borne, wanting either limbs or form, we ascribe it to a defect and error in
the particular nature, from whence the creature is derived, or to the
indisposition of the isntrumental causes, not to the general nature which
tends always unto perfection. How much more then ought this Jesuit be
afraid to ascribe an imperfect creature, to the all-perfect Creator?
especially seeing it is the work of his own hands, without the intermingling
of all second causes, and proceeds immediately from his own spirit, the
Prophets and Apostles, being but as Baruch to Jeremy, writers and engrossers
of that which the spirit did dictate unto them? And therefore I may boldly and
firmly conclude, that as the uncreated word of God, begotten of the Father
before all time, is perfect God, and can neither receive augmentation nor
diminution: so the word of God, pronounced first by the mouth of the Prophets
and Apostles, and after by them committed to writing* which is called the
Scripture, is absolute and perfect, and can neither be increased nor
diminished, to make it more or less perfect, and so is the only true sound
and sacred Rule, whereby both our Faith and life is to be directed toward the
Kingdom of Heaven.

23. And thus I hope, the first proposition remains sound MINOR.
and firm, notwithstanding all that can be said to the contrary. Now I come to
the confirmation of the assumption or second proposition, which is, that the
Religion of the Church of Rome refuses to be tried and judged by the
Scriptures alone, and will be tried and judged by none but it self: which if
it be euicted, then the conclusion must necessarily follow, that therefore it
is not only to be suspected, but utterly rejected and abhorred.

24. That this is so, though it has already in the precedent discourse been
sufficiently demonstrated, yet that the matter may appear more plain, and
their impudency may be more notorious, let us search deeper into this wound,
and discover the filthiness thereof from the very bottom: and first that they
renounce the Scripture from being their Judge, and then in the second place,
that they admit of no other Judge but themselves.

25. Concerning the first, let us hear Bellarmine the Achilles of Rome, speak
foremost, he affirms in express words, that the Scripture is not the rule
of faith, or if it be, that it is a partial and imperfect rule, and utterly
insufficient of it self, without the help of Ecclesiastical traditions. This
assertion is well-neere the whole matter subject of his third and fourth Bell.
de verbo Dei, li. 3. ca. 3.
Books De verbo Dei, which he labors to strengthen by all means possible:
Yea, in the third Chapter of his third Book, he says peremptorily, that the
Pope with a Council is the Judge of the true sense of the Scripture, and all
controversies. Now, in setting up the Pope or a Council into the supreme
throne of Judgment, he must needs pull down the Scripture, and the Spirit of
God speaking therein from that throne, and despoyle it of that authority. But
what need I draw this consequence from his words, seeing throughout that whole
Chapter he does almost nothing else but strive to prove that the Scripture is
not the Judge, and does reprove the Protestants for saying that all the
judgments of the Fathers, and all the decrees of Councils ought to be examined
ad amussim Scripturarum, according to the rule of the Scriptures? Next unto
Bellarmine, comes in Gregory de Valentia, and he most Greg. de Val. li. 5 in
Anal. c. 2. and 3
boldly avouches, that the Scripture is not a sufficient Judge or rule of all
controversies of faith: and that the Scripture alone defines nothing at all,
no not obscurely of the chief questions of faith: and where it does speak, it
speaks so obscurely, that it Hos. 10. 2. aduer. Brent. Proleg.
does not resolve, but rather increase the doubt. Cardinal Hosius is no whit
less audacious, when he affirms, that the Scripture in it self is not the
true and express word of God, which we ought to obey, unless it be expounded
according to the sense and Sal. com. in. esist. Paul. in Genesis Tur. contr. Sade.
Cost. Ench. de sum. Pontif.
consent of the Catholic (that is in his opinion the Roman) Church. The
Jesuits Salmeron, Turrian, and Coster, do not only barely affirm as much,
but also confirm it by reason. The Scripture is dumb (says Salmeron) but the
deciding voice of a Judge must be quick. The Scripture is a dead letter (says
Turrian) and a thing without life (says Coster) but a Judge must be living,
who may correct such as err: therefore that Scripture cannot be the Judge. It
is as it were a Nose of wax (says Melchior Canus) flexible into every sense,
and as it were, a Can. loc. li. 3. c. 2. Turri. vt supra.
Delphian Sword, fit for all purposes (says Turrian) therefore cannot be the
Judge. And therefore two other Jesuits, to wit, Tanner and Gretzer impudently
conclude, that no heresy Coll. Ratisb.
can be sufficiently refuted by Scripture alone, and that by no means it may
be granted, that either the holy Scripture, or the Holy Ghost speaking by the
Scripture, should be the supreme and general Judge of Controversies: and he
adds his reason, because the Scripture cannot dicere sententiam, give sentence
on one side, as a Judge should do. Nay, one Vitus Miletus (as Pelargus
reports) is not ashamed to say, that we Pelarg. Jesuit.
read, that an Ass spoke in the Scripture, but that the Scripture it self
ever spoke, we never read. And thus this fellow makes the Scripture it self to
be more mute then Balaams Ass, and the holy Spirit less able to make that
speak, then an Angel was to make an Ass to speak. Then which, what could be
brayed out more like the beast he speaks of?

26. But some may say, All these are but private men's opinions: we hear not
all this while the determination of the Church. Let us harken therefore to the
voice of the Church touching this point, that is, as they hold of the Council,
or rather Conuenticle of Romish Bishops, assembled together at Trent, which
they call the Church representative. The second Canon of the second decree in
thy fourth Session of that Conc. Trid. ses. 4. decret. 2. can. 2.
Council does thus determine, Let no man trusting to his own wisdom, dare
to interpret the Scripture after his own private sense, or contrary to that
sense which our holy Mother the Church holds, or contrary to the unanimous
consent of the Fathers. The former part of this Canon is good and sound; for
Saint Peter says, that no Scripture is of private interpretation: 2. Pet. 1.
20.
and therefore they which wrest the Scriptures to their own senses, contrary
to the intent and scope of them, are guilty of a grievous sin before God, and
do it to their own destruction: for Optimus scripturae lector est, qui
dictorum intellectum non attulerit, sed retulerit exscriptura, (says Hill.)
that is, He Hilar. de tri. l. 1.
is the best reader of the Scripture, which does not bring a sense to the
Scripture, but draws it out of the Scripture. Besides, the middle and end of
the Canon is not to be misliked, if they have a favorable interpretation; for
the judgment of the Fathers is greatly to be regarded, and the authority of
the Church is to be held in especial reverence: but for all this, latet anguis
in herba, under these fair pretenses of words is couched a snake of foul
error: for first, they tie the gift of interpretation of Scripture, and of
decision of controversies, to the Chair of Peter seated at Rome, and possessed
by the Pope, Peter's successor, as they call him, or to the Chair of Bishops
assembled together in a Council, as in Noah's Arc: whereas Saint Paul says
plainly, speaking of the gift of interpretation, These things workethone and
the same Spirit, distributing to 1. Cor. 12. 11.
every man severally, as he will. And in another place, that the spiritual man
discerns all things, and therefore the Scriptures. 1. Cor. 2. 15.
Now, by the spiritual man, the Apostle means the man regenerate and
sanctified by the Spirit, as it appears by that he opposes him to the
natural man, in the verse going before: and so the gift of discerning and
interpreting is not proper to the Chair of Bishops.

27. Secondly, this Canon does not only give unto the Church, thus conceived
of them, the only gift of interpretation, but also a Praetorian and
vnexaminable authority in interpreting; so that all which they deliver out of
their Chaires, must be received peremptorily without examining the grounds and
reasons, for which they are moved to be of that judgment: which Tyrannical
usurpation, is both contrary to the express precepts and principles of holy
Scripture, and also to the doctrine and practice of all the ancient Fathers:
for the scripture bids to try all things, and to hold that which is good. 1.
These. 5. 21.
And Paul refused not to have his doctrine examined of the Acts 17. 11.
men of Ber^a, by the Scripture: and the same Apost. directs us how to behave
our selves at the time of prophesying, namely, 1. Cor. 14. 29.
that two or three Prophets speak, and the other judge. All which places are
flatopposite to that peremptory obtruding of interpretations upon the Church,
which the Canon speaks of: and Aug. de doctrine. Christian. Orig. hom. 17. in
Exodus Hill. de trin. li. 4. Basil de spir. Sa. cap. 1. Cyr. in Job. lib. 8.
so are all the Fathers in general; for in prescribing certain rules to all
men, both of understanding and interpreting the Scriptures, they plainly show
that there is not this absolute authority, nor infallibility in any, to obtrude
what interpretation soever, without contradiction or examination.

28. Lastly, the Canon in giving this indefinite power of interpretation, and
determination of doubts to the Church, without any relation had to the
Scripture, does utterly iustle out the Scripture from being the Judge. And so
Andradius the interpretour of this Council does expound the intendment Andrad.
thereof, when he says, that the judgment of the Church is, Principium vltra
quod non sit fas in inquisitione progredi, Aprinciple, beyond the which it is
not lawful to proceed in inquisition. By which he gives to understand, that
our faith must rely wholly and solely upon the judgment of the Church, that
is, the Pope and his Prelates, without inquiry at all into the word of God,
whether that which they propound be consonant to the truth or no. As Erasmus in
a certain disputation Eras. ex Chem. exam. pa. 66
against the Papists, confesses, that their opinion has not sure and certain
testimonies of Scripture, but that the contrary opinion may be better and more
clearly and strongly proved out of Gods word; notwithstanding (says he) if the
Church bid, I will believe it, for I will captiuate my understanding to the
obedience of the Church. And this indeed is the Babylonian servitude of the
church of Rome, whereby they fetter the souls of their followers to perpetual
slavery, and lead the^ blindfold under the veil of an implicit faith unto
perdition: for this is the first ground they lay in the hearts of all their
generation, that they must not examine the doctrine of the Church, but take it
at their hands as good coin, though it be never so counterfeit, doctrina in
Concilijs definit a custodie^da est, non examinanda, (says Bell de verbo Dei,
li. 3. c. 10.
Bellarmine) that doctrine which is defined in a Council, is to be kept, not
examined: and ordinarius pastor Ecclesiae audiendus est, non iudicandus (says
Stapleton) an ordinary Pastor of Stap de doctrina prin. li. 1. ca. 5.
the Church is to be heard, not judged: thus we see, that the Scripture is
thrust clean out of doors, from having any right or title in the decision of
questions of faith: not only by private men, but even by their Church it self.

29. Now here two things are to be observed of us, for the plainer enucleation
and clearing of this point: first, that in making the Scripture Judge, we do
not exclude the Church, nor any member of the Church from the office of judging
and discerning, only we place them in their due order and rank: for this is
it we intend, that the Scripture is the highest and most absolute Judge, from
the sentence whereof there is no appeal to be made to any higher Court: and
that the judgment and determination of the Church, or of any member thereof, is
subordinate unto that, and to be ruled and guided by that, and where it is
agreeable unto that, there to be received, where it swarueth from that, to be
rejected. For as in the civil estate, the Judges deputed to that office, have
no absolute authority in themselves, but are subject unto the law, and the
Ministers thereof, and therefore must not speak what they list, but what the
law directs: so in the state Ecclesiastical, they that are inferior Judges,
are but the Ministers of the law of God, and must not vary from the rule
thereof in any respect. And for this cause, as the Jews were commanded Deuteronomy.
17. 10, 11
to obey the sentence and determination of the Priest in all controversies, so
the Priest was commanded to give judgment according to the law, and no
otherwise: and albeit the Hebrew gloss upon that Text teaches, that if the
Priest say that the right hand is the left, or the left is the right, his
sentence is to be holden, (which is the plain doctrine of the Church of Rome,
Iudaizing in this as in many other things) yet Lyra Lyra on Deu. 17
writing upon that Text says, that the gloss is manifestly false, because the
sentence of no man, of what authority soever, is to be holden, if it be
contrary to the law of God: so we admit the Church to be Judge, and every
private Christian also in his place, but we ascribe the chief power and
authority of Judging to the Scripture alone. The next place we allow unto the
Church, and the lowest unto the particular members thereof: These last to be
directed by the Church, but yet so far as it brings it authority out of the
Scriptures, and it to be limited by the bounds of the Scripture also: and if it
judge against the evidence thereof, not to be heard nor believed. This is our
opinion, that we may not be mistaken: but our adversaries advance their Church
unto the highest place, and make the Scripture an inferior vassal, and
servant unto it, as I have declared.

30. Secondly, note thereason that moves them, thus to disclaim from the
judgment of the Scripture: it is because they know full well, that the maynest
and chiefest points of their Religion, wherein they dissent from us, have no
ground nor foundation in the Scripture, but would vanish like a morning aust,
if the light of Gods word should but shine upon them: as for instance, their
doctrines of worshipping Images, of tasting days, of prayer for the dead, of
Purgatory, of shrift, of pardons, of the communion in one kind, of single
life, and of the private Mass, and such like: all which points and many other,
their own Writers contesse, cannot be sufficiently proved out of the
Scripture. And therefore Andradius Andrad. Orthod. explic. lib. 2.
does fully and ingenuously acknowledge, that many points of their Religion
would reele and stagger, if they were not supported by tradition: and
Bellarmine himself says, that it Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3 cap. 23. How contrary
is this to that of S. Augustine, out faith should reele and totter, if the
authority of the Scripturestand not fast, Aug. de doct. Chris. lib. 1. cap. 23.
may be doubted whether the great point of transubstantiation may be
sufficiently enforced out of the words of the Text, Hoc est corpus meum: So
that we see now the reason why they will not be tried by the Scriptures, even
this, because if the Scripture be Judge, Popery must needs go to wrack.
This is there fore a cunning and witty policy, or rather a gross and palpable
subtilty of theirs, whereby though they dazzle the sight of the simple and
ignorant, yet they cannot bleare the eyes of the understanding and wise, from
discerning into their fraud.

31. Having thus proved, that they reject the Scripture, now I come to show,
that they allow of no other Judges but themselves: for the proof whereof,
there needs no long discourse, seeing it is sufficiently apparent, by that
which has already been delivered, that they appeal from the sentence of the
Scripture unto the judgment of the Church, and tie unto the girdle thereof,
the only key of interpretation. Now by the Church, they intend first the
Romish Synagogue, that is, all that whole bony which depends upon the Pope
for their head, and receive as it were life, and nourishment by his influence:
for (as Bristo says) the Roman Bristo mot. 12. in marg. Rhem. Annot. in Romans
Church is the Catholic Church, and as the Rhemists, the Catholic and the
Roman faith is all one. Secondly, by the Church, they mean more particularly a
congregation of Romish Bishops and Prelates assembled together in a Council,
which they call the Church representative. And thirdly and principally, Aquin.
22. q. 11. art. Greg. de Valent. Anal. fid. p. 136.
they intend by the Church, the Pope, who is the head of the Church, and
contains in him virtually all the power and authority of the Church. The
Church in the first sense, is not to be this Judge (say they) nor yet in the
second: which notwithstanding, is but an vpstart opinion, and but of the first
Council. Constant. Ses. 4. 5. Basilsess. 2.
head: for in the Councils of Constance and Basil, it was decreed, that the
Pope should obey the Council, and be ordered by it in all things pertaining to
faith, and the reformation of the (...): and many learned Romanists have been
of the same opinion, as Bellarmine confesses: but now neither Bell. de council.
li. 2. cap. 14.
may the Council be Judge: therefore take the Church in the third sense for
the Pope, and then you have the man that is the Church virtuall, and must be
all in all, even the only Judge and Vmpier in all controversies. The center in
which all the lines, that is, opinions of Fathers, Councils, and Divines must
concur and meet. The Epitome and abridgement of the whole Church, in whom
alone remains the Silu. sum. verb. sides nu. 2.
whole power of the Catholic Church. And thus from the Scripture, they call us
to the Church, from the Church to the Councils, and from them to the Pope, and
there they pitch their line, as in the highest point of resolution.

32. That they thus understand by the Church, the Pope, and that all judgment
is deuolued unto him alone, hear them speak in their own persons. Bellarmine
says, that the Pope without a Council may define matters of faith, because
being Bell. de Christo li. 2. cap. 28.
the universal* Pastor, and Teacher of the Church, he cannot err, teaching
out of the chair: and that he is absolutely above Idem de council. lib. 2. cap.
17. Idem cap. 18.
the Council, and that he may, as he is the chief Prince of the Church,
retract the judgment of the Council, and not follow the greater part. And
therefore, when he affirms in another place, that the Pope with a Council,
is the Judge of Idem de Verbo Dei, li. 3. ca. 3.
the true sense of the Scripture; he foysteth in the word Council for a
flourish, but indeed, he means the Pope alone: for if the Pope be above all
Councils, and may establish or disanull their decrees at his pleasure, then is
not he with a Council, but without a Council the chief Judge.

33. Gregory of Valence is more plain By the Church (says Greg. de Valent.
disp. Theol. tom. 1 dis. 1. q. 1. p. 1. and Anal. fid. p. 136.
he) we mean her head: that is to say, the Roman Bishop, in whom resideth the
full authority of the Church: the Jesuit Coster, after he has discarded the
Scripture from being Judge, because it is, Res sine anima and sensu, in varias
pugnantesque sent entias Cost. Enchir. de sum. Pontif.
distracta: A thing without life and sense, distracted into diverse and contrary
opinions, says, that Penes Ecclesia^ Cathelica^ est indicium veritatis, The
judgment of the truth is belonging to the Catholic Church, but because the
whole Church cannot meet together in one place, without great inconveniences.
Therefore God has appointed and nominated one man, to wit, the Pope, to whom
he has so tied his presence and spiritual grace, that in question^ of faith
he does never err. Gretzer Colloq. Rat. Ses. 1
says, that the general; lawful, and ordinary Judge of controversies, is
the Bishop of Rome, whether he define any thing alone, or with a General
Council, this Judge is always infallible. Staplet on says, that the
foundation of our Religion is placed of Staplet. praefat. princip. fid. doct.
Job. de Turr. li. 3. cap. 64.
necessity upon the authority of this man^ teaching, in whom we hear God
himself speaking. And another of them says, Si to^us mundus sententiaret
contra Papam, If the whole world should determine against the Pope, yet we must
stand to his sentence. To In Sext. extrau. Ioh. 22. tit. 14. and did. 19. in
Canon. and gloss.
conclude, the Canon Law says, that it were heresy to think, that our Lord
God the Pope might not decree as he does, yea, that his rescripts and
decretall Epistles are not Canonical Scripture.

34. Thus we see, the Pope is that which they mean by the Church: and he is
the only compendious Judge: and therefore when they talk of the Church, it is
but a vain vaunt; for when all comes to all, they entend nothing by the
Church, but their Lord God the Pope, as the Canonists call him: who is ens
secundae intentionis compofitum ex Deo and homine, Extrau. in Ioh. 22. Ioh.
Capist. de Pap. et Eccles. authorit.
Abeing of the second intention, compounded of God and man, and quasi Deus in
terris, etc. as it were a God upon earth, greater then man; and less then God,
having the fullness of power. Now by this that has been said, the truth of my
second proposition does evidently appear; to wit, that the Romanists will
allow no other Judges in matter of controversy, but themselves alone, and so
give just cause to all that are not blinded with error, at least to suspect
their Religion, if not utterly to abandon it, which is the conclusion
necessarily following upon these premises.

35. Which, that it is of most necessary consequence, appears by this,
because it is against all reason, that the same should be both the party and
the Judge: yea, in equity is it fit, that we should stand to his judgment,
whom we accuse to be a falsifier of the Scripture, and even Antichrist
himself? or that that Church should be our Church, which we affirm and
prove to be an Apostate, and an harlot? seeing that a Judge should be
indifferent and impartial, and not a party: as the Church and Pope of Rome is
in all cases of controversy depending betwixt them and us; as for example in
the controversy of the Church, the question being which is the true Church.
The Judge to determine thereof, we say, is the Scripture: they cry, The Church,
meaning their own Church, as I have showed. Do they not by their doctrine
advance themselves into the tribunal seat, and make their Church the Judge,
whether it be the Church or no? so in the question touching the Popes
Supremacy, who shall be Judge whether this supreme power be in the Pope or no?
Mary the Pope himself, for they admit no other Judge. Sure he must needs
gain the cause, when he is thus his own Judge. If this be not a plain
terg^ue^s^tion, I know not what is: if this does not bewray the weakness of
their cause, let any indifferent man consider and give sentence.

36. For as on ourside in the question of the Kings Supremacy, whether every
King in his own dominion be the supreme Governor of the Church under Christ
or no: if we should in this case admit no Judge, but the King himself: Or in
the question of our Church, whether we be the true Church of Christ or no: if
we should refuse all other trial, save that which arises from the judgment
of our own Church, and the Bishops and Prelates thereof; would not all men
laugh at our folly, and think our cause weak and desperate? So may all men
think of the Romish Religion, that it be wrayeth manifest folly in the
maintayners, and apparent weakness in the grounds thereof, in that it will
not be judged but by itself, especially seeing it is the property of
selfeloue, whereof no man living is freed, to make men blind in their own
causes, and partial on their own sides. To conclude therefore, as the Lion in
Esope, that challenged to himself the whole prey that was caught, and would
not stand to the equal partition of his fellow-hunters, proved himself
thereby to be a tyrant, and his title naught: so the Pope of Rome, and his
Proctours, in refusing to be judged by any save themselves, and by that right
clayming a title to the truth, discovers both his tyranny over the Church of
God, and the holy Scriptures, and the badnesse of his weak cause; seeing truth
like a chaste matrone, though it be slandered, yet is so bold and powerful,
that it fears not to be tried by those that are the greatest enemies thereof.

Spectatum admissirisum teneatis amici? MOTIVE. VI. That Religion does justly
deserve to be suspected, which does purposely disgrace the sacred Scriptures:
But such is the Religion of the Church of Rome: Ergo, etc.
Our Adversaries may fitly be likened to churlish and angry Mastifes, whose
property it is to rend with their teeth those that are unarmed, and not able to
resist: but if they meet with an armed man, that can keep them off and
entertain them with sharp blows, then they wreak all their teene upon the
cudgel or weapon wherewith they are annoyed: so they seeing themselves well
banged and beaten by our men at Arms, I mean, our Champions that defend the
quarrel of our Church, with the staff of the Scripture, and their hairy
scalpes wounded with the stones fetched out of David's scrip, fall a snarling and
biting the staff, and the stones which have been the instruments of their
sorrow; whereas if they find any without a staff in his hand, or a stone in
his sling, that is unfurnished with Scripture to fight with them, over him they
domineere, and take him captive, and lead him to their den for a prey. This
their malice against the sacred Scripture, which is the only engine of their
destruction, I hope by Gods favorable assistance so to discover in this
Chapter, that they themselves shall ever be reputed as blasphemers of the
truth, and their religion as odious and abominable to all posterity.

2. The Mayor or first proposition in this demonstration, MAYOR.
though it be of an undoubted truth, yet for the greater illustratio: thereof,
two points are to be considered: first, what this Scripture is, which is
opposed against: and secondly, what they are to be esteemed which oppose
themselves unto the Scripture. The Scripture contained in the Old and new
Testament, is, in a word, the holy and sacred word of the eternal God: which
to have said of it, is an ascription of the greatest dignity unto it, as can
be devised: for if it be the holy and sacred word of the eternal God, then
must it needs be perfect. excellent, pure, upright, clean, permanent, wife,
sweet, and what else may be spoken for the setting forth of the excellency of a
thing: all which attributes are given unto it by the Prophet David, in the 19.
Psalm, and do necessarily Psalm. 19.
appertain unto it, being immediately derived from that clear and sole
fountain of all goodness and perfection: For howsoever the holy Prophets were
the penne-men thereof; yet those were all and in every parcel and particle
inspired by the Holy Ghost, as Saint Peter informs us, when he said, That no
Prophecy in the Scripture is of any private 2. Pet. 1. 20. 21.
motion, but that holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost.
For as the heathen Oracles were conceived, and uttered by the immediate
instigation of the Devil, who guided both the hearts and tongues of his
Priests, to be the instruments of his malice: So the Oracles of Christians, to
wit, the holy Scriptures, proceeded from the sacred inspiration of Gods Spirit,
moving the hearts, and directing the pens of the Prophets and Apostles his
Secretaries, to commit to writing that only which they received from God, both
in respect of matter and manner. To this purpose is that notable saying of
Hugo, In the holy Scripture, whatsoever is taught, is truth: Hugo de anima.
whatsoever is commanded, is goodness: whatsoever is promised, is happiness:
And he adds the reason; Because God is truth, without deceit; goodness,
without malice; and happiness, without misery.

3. I need not stand to prove this position, That the Scripture is the
infallible word of the eternal God: it is a grounded truth, and a received
principle of all that profess themselves to be Christians. And as Saint Basil
says, Like as of every Basil in Psa. 115
Science there are (...), unquestionable Principles which are believed without
further demonstration: so in the Science of Sciences, Theology. This is one of
those unquestionable principles, that the Scripture is the word of God, and
therefore of divine both purity and authority. Add hereunto, that if any
should doubt thereof, the purity and perfection of the matter, the majesty and
the stateliness of the style, the power and efficacy over the conscience, the
certainty of Prophesies fulfilled in the duenesse of time, the strangeness of
the miracles, the antiquity of the writings before all other, the admirable
providence of God in preserving them from the teeth of time, and rage of
Tyrants, the sweet harmony and consent of every part with each other, the
judgments of God against the contemners thereof, and lastly, the blood of so
many thousand Martyrs which has been shed in the defense thereof, do
sufficiently convince and prove, that this Book is the Book of GOD, and every
line and title therein, the Word of God.

4. This being so, then secondly it must needs follow, that either to deny the
Scripture to be the Word of God, or to abuse it with vnreuerent terms and
reproaches, or any ways to diminish the credit and authority thereof, is not
only plain blasphemy, but also open and notorious Atheifme; and so in both
high treason against the Majesty of God: for, if it be treason to use
contumelious speeches against the Kings person, or either by word to revile, or
by deed to resist his decrees and proclamations: how much more does that
deserve the name of the highest treason, when the sacred word of God, which is
a divine Law, issuing from his own mouth, is blasphemed, and the majesty of
God most clearly shining, therein abused? It is an old and a true saying in
ciuility, Qui contemnit legem, contemnit Regem: He that despises the Law,
despises the lawgiver. So much more then in Divinity, he that reprocheth
the word of God, reprocheth God himself. How can they then be less than
Atheists, Blasphemours, and Traitors to God, that are guilty of all this
injury to the holy Scripture?

5. Celsus, against whom Origin wrote, and Lucian, and Porphery, and Apelles,
were Whelps of this Litter; and therefore remain to this day branded with the
note of infamy: to these succeeded many others in after-ages (for the world
has never been without such monsters, God permitting them for the further
demonstration of his truth, and declaration of his just judgment in their
deserved and strange destruction:) yea, that which is most strange, many of
those that have vaunted themselves for Christ's Vicars here on earth, have been
taynted with this infection, as Pope Leo the tenth, who (as Writers report)
mocked at the promises and threats of the Balaeus.
Scripture, and told Cardinal Bembus, that that fable of Christ had brought
unto him and his, great profit. Such another was John the twelfth, who used to
blaspheme God, and call upon Cuit. prand. li. 6. ^as^^cul. tempor. Stella.
Platina.
the devil at his dice: and Julius the third, who asked why he should not be
as angry for the eating of a cold Peacock, as God was for the eating of an
Apple? And Benedict the eight, alias the ninth, whose custom was in Woods and
Mountains, to sacrifice to the devil: and diverse others, which for breuity
sake I forbear to name. Is it possible that such Athiests, and blasphemous
wretches, and worshippers of devils, should be chosen of Christ to be his
Vicars here on earth, to whom he might commit the government of his Church?
Will a mortal man commit the government of his family, especially if he loves
his wife and children, to a known Ruffin and a notorious villaiue? Now Christ
so loves his family, his Church, that to purchase and redeem it, he gave his
own precious blood, for a ransom for it: and will he now ordain in his
room such notorious Wolves, to be the ministerial heads and guides thereof?
As for the rest of the Popish crew, both learned and unlearned, though they
be, as I must needs confess, for the most part, more infected with
superstition, then with Atheism, (albeit never did any Country more swarm
with that generation, then does Italy at this day) yet in blaspheming and
debasing the holy Scripture, they cannot be far from, not only giuing-way,
and opening a wide door to that horrible sin, but also from making an open
profession thereof.

6. Thus we see both what the Scripture is, and also what they are that oppose
against the Scripture: which two considerations serve much for the clearing of
the first proposition. Now I come to the confirmation of the assumption or
second MINOR.
proposition, which every Romanist will deny in this argument, and therefore
stands in need of stronger fortification: the proposition is this, that the
Religion of the Church of Rome does purposely disgrace the holy Scriptures, and
is at enmity with it: that is, that both by doctrine, practice, and bitter and
blasphemous speeches, the holy Scripture is disgraced, defaced, and vilely
slandered by the chief professors and maintayners of that Religion, yea, and
by the grounds of the Religion it self. I will begin with their doctrine, and
secondly come to their practice, and in the last place their slanderous and
bitter speeches shall be discovered.

7. Amongst many of their doctrines, whereby they offer open injury and wrong
to the sacred Scriptures, these four are the most principal: First, that
which has been at large discoursed in the former Chapter, touching the chief
Judge of controversies: for, when as they disable the Scripture from that
office, and exalt the Church, that is, the Pope, as I have showed, into the
highest throne of judgment, what do they else but debase the Scripture, in
subiecting it to the Popes will, and making it a vassal to wayt upon his
pleasure, and giving a greater certainty and infallibility to the
determinations of his mouth, speaking out of his chair, then unto the
infallible and certain light of truth, shining in the Scriptures? This is open
wrong to the Scriptures, and not only to it, but also to the Spirit of God,
the Author and Enditer thereof; for, they which set up the Pope as an
all-sufficient and most competent Judge, and pull down the Scripture as
non-sufficient and incompetent, as the Romanists do, do they not advance the
one, and disgrace the other? as on the contrary, we which ascribe all
con^petencie of right, and sufficiency of power to the Scripture, and deny
the same to the Pope, do we not disgrace him, and advance it? This is the
difference in this point betwixt them and us, and their Religion and ours: and
that men may see how little estimation they have of the Scripture compared with
their Pope, though the Pope be a man utterly unlettered, and ignorant even of
the grounds of Grammar, much more of the grounds of Divinity, as some Baron.
Glaber. Rodulph. Spondan. Annal. Eccl. s. an. 1033. Balaeus.
of them were: though he be a child of ten years of age, as Bennet the
ninth, or a mad Lad not past eighteen years old, as John the twelfth; though
he be an Atheist, as was Leo the tenth, or a Coniurer, as Julius the third:
Lastly, though he were a man destayned with all manner of filthy and lewd
conversation, as a number of them were: yet his judgment If quatenus home, he
go to hell, what will his quatenus Papa do him good? Baldus.
must be heard and preferred, because (forsooth) quatenus Papa, as he is Pope,
he cannot err, though quatenus homo, as he is a man, he be an Heretic, or an
Atheist, or a wicked wretch: or because Papa est doctor vtriusque legis
authoritate, non scientia. The Pope is Doctor of both laws in authority, and
not in knowledge: And thus by their Religion, the holy and sacred Scripture
must give place, and bow the knee to an unholy, sacrilegious, and ignorant Pope
oftentimes, and acknowledge him as Judge, and submit it self to his sentence
and censure.

8. The second doctrine of theirs, whereby they disgrace and wrong the
Scripture, is that touching the insufficiency and imperfection thereof: for
they are not ashamed to say that the Scripture is imperfect and insufficient of
it self, and that in it are not contained all things needful to salvation,
but that a great part. yea, the greatest part of true Religion, is grounded
upon tradition, without the which the Church of GOD could not be sufficiently
instructed, either in faith or manners: this is their goodly doctrine: whereas
we on the other side hold and maintain, that the Canonical Scripture
contains in it sufficiently, plainly, and abundantly all doctrines necessary
to be known, for the attainment of salvation, Iraen. li. 3. ca. 1. Orig. hom.

whether they be positions of faith, or directions for godliness: and that
thereis no need of any unwritten traditions, for the suppliance of any want or
defect which is found therein. And herein we have not only all the ancient
Fathers of the primitive and purer times of the Church our Abbetters, as
Iraeneus, Origin, Athanasius, Basil, Chrysostom, Cyril, Tertullian, Cyprian,
Augustine, Hierome, as you may see in the places quoted in the Margent: but
also the testimony of the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures, plainly and directly
affirming the same.

9. That this imputation of imperfection and insufficiency is laid by them upon
the Scripture, let us hear themselves acting their own parts: and first
Bellarmine the Ringleader. He in his fourth Book De verbo Dei, and fourth
Chapter, sets down this position, that the Scriptures without traditions are
not simply necessary nor sufficient: and throughout that whole Chapter does
nothing else but labor to prove the same by many arguments and reasons, as if
he were not content barely to affirm so high a blasphemy, but even (as the
Poet says) Cum ratione insanire, To be mad with reason: and so are all his
reasons there used, in very deed mad reasons, which my purpose is not to spend
time in confuting, (that being sufficiently performed by our great and learned
Champions of the truth, which as yet remain unanswered: only it is enough for
my intent to discover to all men his notable blasphemy against the holy
Scriptures, which not only in that place, but in many other, evidently and
impudently shows it self.

10. Next unto him comes in another great Jesuit, Gregory Greg. de Valent.
Anal. fid. l. 8. c. 6
de Valentia, and he plays his part, and says, That the most fittest way of
delivering the doctrine of faith to the Church, was this, not that all should
be committed to writing, but that some things should be delivered viua voce,
that is, by tradition. But Cardinal Hosius more plainly and boldly affirms,
That Hosius confess. Petric. ca. 92.
the greatest part of the Gospel is come to us by tradition, and that very
title of it is committed to writing: Yea, it is reported of him, that he should
say, Melius actum fuisse cum Ecclesia, si nullum extaret scriptum Euangelium,
That it had been better for the Church, if there were no written Gospel
extant. O blasphemy! and yet wisely spoken, if so be by the Church, he means
the Church of Rome, as without doubt he does. But let us hear another of the
same stamp Eckius, I mean Eckius Enchir. cap. 4.
that peremptory Bragadochio, he steps forth, and shoots his bolt in a moment,
The Lutherans are dolts (says he) which will have nothing believed but that
which is express Scripture, or can be proved out of Scripture: for all things
are not delivered manifestly in the Scriptures, but very many are left to the
determination of the Church. Coster another Stage Player of theirs Cost. Ench.

comes in, and diuides the word into three parts, to wit, That which God
himself writ, as the tables of the Law; that which he commanded others to
write, as the Old and the New Testament; and that which he neither writ
himself, nor rehearsed to others, but left it to themselves as traditions, the
decrees of Popes, and Councils. And then he concludes blasphemously, that many
things of faith are wanting in the two former, neither would Christ have his
Church depend upon them, but this latter is the best scripture, the Judge of
controversies, the Expositor of the Bible, and that whereupon we must wholly
depend. His words are these, Omnia fidei mysteria, ccaeeraque credita and scitu
necessaria, ^n cord Ecclesiae sunt clarissime exarata, in membranis tamen tam
noui quam veteris Testaments multa defiderantur: that is, All the mysteries of
faith, and other things necessary to be believed and known, are most clearly
engraven in the heart of the Church, but in the leaves of the Old and New
Testament, many things are wanting. What can be more plain? Yet Lindanus is
more plain, for he calls Traditionem non scriptam, etc. The unwritten Lindan
panopl. lib. 2. cap. 5.
tradition, that Homericall moly which preserves the Christian faith against
the enchantments of Heretics, and the true touchstone of true and false
doctrine, and the A^acian buckler to be opposed to all Heretics, and in
conclusion, the very foundation of faith. To this fellow adioyne Melchior Canus
as a companion in blasphemy, who says, That many things belong to Christian
Canus loc. lib. 3. cap. 3.
faith, which are contained in the Scripture, neither openly nor obscurely. To
conclude all in one sum, without any further repetition of private men's
opinions, wherein much time might be spent, the voice of their whole Church
represented in the Council of Trent, is this, That traditions are to be
received, Council. Triden. Sess. 4.
pari pietate, with the same reverence and affection, wherewith we receive the
Scripture it self. Thus we have a view of the doctrine of the Church of Rome,
touching the insufficiency of the holy Scripture, both in part and whole. Out
of all which, these two impious conclusions do necessarily arise: First, that
traditions unwritten are equal, if not superior in dignity and authority to
the written word of God: and secondly, that without the help of them, it is
not able to bring us either to a saving faith in this life, or to the end of
our faith in the life to come: then both which, what could be spoken more
injurious either to the Word it self, or to the Majesty of that Spirit, from
whom it proceeded? And that their blasphemy might be known ^o all men,
Bellarmine, more like a Julian Bell. deverbo Dei, l. 4. c. 4.
then a Christian, does not only affirm the Scripture to be insufficient and
imperfect, but also not simply necessary, and to that end he makes a good
round discourse, and brings in long Leaden arguments, which indeed are not
worth the answering, for they are mere sophistical collusions, as any one of
mean judgment may easily discern. Nevertheless, by this we may see, what an
honorable opinion and affection these fellows bear toward the Scripture,
when as they dare to affirm that they are not simply necessary, but may be
wanting and removed without any great hurt to the Church of God.

12. The third injurious doctrine, whereby open disgrace 3.
is offered to the holy Scripture, is concerning the authority thereof,
compared with the Church: for this they teach and hold, That the authority of
the Scripture does depend upon the Church, and not the Church upon the
Scripture. And so by consequent, that the Scripture is inferior to the Church,
and not the Church to the Scripture: whereas we on the contrary affirm and
defend, that the Church wholly depends both for authority and existency upon
the Scripture, and so is every way inferior to the Scripture, and not the
Scripture upon the Church.

13. This blasphemy of theirs may more evidently be discerned, if we observe
what they understand by the Church, to wit, not the Primitive Church, which was
in the time and immediately Canus loc. lib. 2. cap. 8. Stapl. doct. princ. li.
9. c. 12. and 13.
after the Apostles, but the succeeding and present Church: and that not the
whole Catholic Church, which is dispersed over the world, but the Church of
Rome, which holds upon the Pope as the Vicar of Christ: and in this Church,
not the whole body, but the Pastors and Prelates assembled in a Council: yea,
and lastly, not the Council neither, but the Pope, who is totus in toto, all
in all, and in whom all the members meet, and resolve themselves as lines in
the center, as is before declared. This is their Church: and to this Church of
theirs they subject the Scriptures, even the word of God to the Pope of Rome,
that is, God himself to a mortal sinful man. For as Nil^^ the Archbishop
of Nilus de cause. d^ss. lib. 1.
Thessalonica says, To accuse the Scripture, is to accuse God, so to debase
the Scripture, is to debase God.

14. That we may see this to be true, and that we lay no false imputation to
their charge, hear them speak in their own words, and let Bellarmine lead
the Ring, If we take away Bell. de effect. sacram. li. 2. ca. 25.
(says he) the authority of the present Church, and of the Council of Trent,
then the whole Christian faith may be called in question: for the truth of all

faith depend upon the authority of the present Church of Rome. Mark, he says
not upon the authority of the Scripture, but of the present church of Rome;
where he does manifestly prefer the authority of the Church, before the
Scripture, and not only of the Church, but of the Church of Rome, as if there
were no Church but that: and not the Church of Rome; as it was, in the purer
and primer times, but the present Church corrupted, and depraved with infinite
errors. Again, in another place he concludes, That the Scriptures do depend
upon Bell. li. 4. de not. Eccles. ca. 2.
the Church, and not the Church on the Scriptures: which position he confesses
in the same place, to have been in other places maintained by him. And yet
elsewhere he disclaimeth Idem de council. author. li. 2. c. 12.
this opinion as none of theirs, and calls it a blasphemy: that it is his, I
have showed already, though he be ashamed of it as he may well be, and
therefore exore suo, by his own judgment, he, and all the rest are guilty of
most gross and intolerable blasphemy. But that you may see that it is the
general received doctrine of them all, for the most part; hear others as well
as him, uttering their spleen against the Scriptures. Siluester Prierias
says, that Indulgences are warranted unto Silu. Prier. cont. Luther. conclus.
de potest. Papae.
us not by the authority of the Scripture, but by the authority of the Church,
and Pope of Rome, which is greater. And again, That the Scripture draws it
strength and authority from the Church and Bishop of Rome. Eckius says, that
the Scripture Eckius Ench. de author. Eccles. resp. 3. ad object. Haret.
Pighius de Hier. Eccles. li. 1. ca. 2.
was not authentical, but by the authority of the Church: and puts this
proposition among heretical assertions, The authority of the Scripture is
greater then the Church. Pighius also affirms the same, that all the
authority of Scriptures does necessarily depend upon the authority of the
Church: and calls all that hold the contrary in scorn, Scriptuarij, that is,
Scripturemen, or such as maintain the Scripture. Cardinal Hosius goes Hos.
lib. 3. de auther. Scriptur.
further, and commends a blasphemous speech of one Hermannus, as a godly
saying, That the Scriptures are of no more force then Aesops Fables, without
the testimony of the Church: and adds presently of his own, that unless
the Churches authority did commend unto us the Canonical Scripture, it should
be of little account with us. The like is delivered Coclaeus replicat. cont.

Council. lib. 2. cap. 12. Andrad. Staplet.
by Coclaeus, by Canus, Stapleton, Andradius, Canisius, and generally all other
of that side that handle that question.

15. Only to palliate the matter, they bring in a distinction, to wit, that
this dependence of the Scriptures authority upon the Church is, quoad nos, in
respect of us, not qu^adse, in respect of it self, and declaratiue, for
declaration sake, not effectiue, as the cause thereof: which distinction first
implies a contradiction, for the authority of a thing is quoad extra, in
respect of others, not quoad intra, in respect of it self, that is, rather to
be termed dignity and excellency, then authority: secondly, that being
granted, yet it imports a falshoode in them, and concludes directly our
purpose, for by it the last resolut on of our faith should not be into the
Scripture, but into the authority of the Church, which is contrary both to
truth, and to their own principles. For why do they attribute Mulbusin. Resp.
ad Par^um, de cript. author. these. 33.
that infallible authority to the Church, but because the Scripture says so,
as they themselves acknowledge? And then to affirm that the Church is of
greater authority in respect of us, is sufficient to ^uince, that in respect of
us, they prefer the Church before the Scripture. What is this, but to offer
open injury and disgrace to the holy Scripture, especially, seeing a Jesuit of
their own is bold to say, that a man may mordicus tenere, and propugnare
acerrime* strongly hold, and stoutly Sacrob^sc def. Bell. par. 1. c. 6.
maintain a doctrine contrary to the word of God, and yet be no Heretic,
unless the opposite to that opinion, be defined by the Church in his time?

16. The fourth and last doctrine whereby they offer injury 4.
to the Scripture, is this, That the Pope may dispense with the Law of God.
This the Popes vassals do not only affirm, Michael Medin. Christian. par^n.
lib. 7. cap. 17. Abbas Panorm. extra. de diuort. cap. ^in. Fel^^. de constitut
cap. statut. canon.
but even confirm and avouch. For thus they teach, Potestas in diuinas leges
ordinary in Romano Pontifice residet, Power over the laws of God remains
ordinarily in the Pope of Rome: and that the Pope may dispense against the
Apostles, yea, against the new Testament upon great cause, and also against all
the precepts of the old Testament. The reason whereby they confirm this brave
doctrine, is this, that where the reason of the law fails, there the Pope may
dispense, but the reason of the law always fails, where he judges it to
fail, (for speaking definitiuely, he cannot err) therefore the Pope may
dispense with the precepts of the Old and New Testament, where, and when he
list. Now, what can be more injurious to the Scripture then this? for first,
they set the Pope above the scriptures, because he that takes upon him to
dispense with the law of another, challenges to himself a greater authority
then the other, according as their own rule is, In praecepto superioris non
debet dispensare Anton. par. 3. tit. 22. ^^. 6.
inferior, The inferior may not dispense with the commandment of the
superior. Secondly, they equal him to God himself, for whereas there is no
exception nor exemption from the law of God: but this Nisi deus aliter
voluerit, Except God otherwise appoint, they instead thereof put in this
exception, Nisi Papa aliter voluerit. And lastly, they make the law of God a
maimed and an imperfect law, in that (as their divinity is) it cannot give
sufficient direction to man's life, for practice of duties and avoiding of
sins, in all cases, without the Poprs dispensation, and the interposition of
his superwise authority.

17. From their injurious doctrines, let us come to their malicious practice
against the Scripture, that both by their precepts and practice, their enmity
to the Scriptures may fully appear. First therefore, whereas the language
wherein the Scriptures were originally written, is indeed the true Scriptures,
because that is the immediate dialect of the holy Ghost, and the translations
of it into other tongues, are no farther to be regarded then as they agree
with the original; yet the Church of Rome, in the Council of Trent, has
canonized Conc. Trident. Sess. 4.
the vulgar Latin above the Hebrew and Greek, and has ^n^oyned it only to
be used in all readings, disputations, sermons, and expositions, and not to be
rejected under any pretense whatsoever, upon pain of Anathema. Yea,
Bellarmine, Bell. de verb^ Dei, lib. 2.
with the rest of that crew, accuse the Greek and Hebrew, of many corruptions,
and justify the vulgar Latin above them, as most free from corruptions:
whereas notwithstanding, for one corruption which they would saine fasten upon
them, there are to be found twenty in this, and that by the confession Lind. de
opt. genesis interp. lib. 3.
of many learned of their own side.

18. Besides, those corruptions which are supposed to be in M^lin. in 1. Tho.
page 399. Poss. Bibl. select. lib. 3. ca. 6.
the originals, are either none at all, as may easily be proved, and is
already sufficiently by our learned Divines: or else such as are not of that
weight to derogate from the perfection of the Scripture in things pertaining to
faith and good Poss. ibid. Sixth. Senen. Bibl. sanct li. 8. p. 318
manners; as Posseuine and Sixtus Senensis confess, or at least are but
errors of the Writers, which no Book is free from, growing either from humane
infirmity, or from the mistaking of the letters in the Greek, and pricks in
the Hebrew; which last is but a late invention of the Massorites, and no
essential part of the Text: whereas on the contrary, the errors which are
extant i^ the vulgar Latin, are many of them contrary to the grounds of faith:
as that one for all, in the third of Genesis, where the Latin reads, ipsa
conteret caput tuum, she shall bruise thy head: which they apply unto the
Virgin Marie, being in the original ipse his, and in the Septuag^nt (...),
that is, He, understanding Christ our Savior. Here we see a fundamental
point of says overthrown, not only in accommodating a Prophecy of Christ
unto the Virgin his mother, but also in ascribing unto her the work of our
Redemption, signified by the bruising of the Serpents head. And as in this, so
in many other places, which I willingly for brevity sake ^uerpasse. And yet
for all this, by their doctrine and practice, their Latin Translation is only
authentical. Yea, so impudent is a Bishop of theirs, that setting forth the
Bible in diverse Languages, he places the vulgar Latin betwixt the Hebrew and
the Greek, as Christ betwixt two thieves, as blasphemousl^ (...). Bibl.
(...)olo.
he speaks. This is therefore a notable iniuricus practice of theirs against
the Scripture.

19. To which add second, no wh^t inferior to the former, ^.
which ^^ their forbidding the Scripture to be translated into the mother
tongue of every Nation, to the end that it may be to the common people as a
Book sealed up, and that they might not read, nor be exercised therein. This
prohibition is both contrary to the practice of all the Saints of God, both
under the Law and the Gospel, for it was their daily exercise to meditate upon
the Law of God continually, and to search the Scriptures, whether those things
which they heard were so or no, and to the plain precept of Christ, and the
Apostle Psalm. 1. ^. Deuteronomy. 6. 7. 8. 9. and 17. 18. 19. Acts 17. 11. John 5. 39.

bidding us to search the Scriptures, and to have the word of God to dwell
plentiously in us: and to the doctrine of all the ancient Fathers, who with one
consent exhort and persuade to the diligent reading of them, as may appear by
the places quoted in the margent: And beside, is most injurious to the
Scriptures themselves: for to restrain a common good to a particular use, is
an open wrong to the good it self, which the more common it is, the better it
is, and the less common, the less good; for bonum est sui diffusiuum, good
inclines naturally to spread it self, and therefore the restriction thereof
is violence and force offered to the nature of it, and truth cannot abide to
be imprisoned, but loves liberty. This is true in all natural, good, and
true things, but much more in this supernatural good, and truth, which as
Origen^ well notes, was not written for a few* as Platoes Books were, but for
the people and multitude, yea, for the veriest Idiots, and women, and children,
as the Fathers affirm.

20. And yet these presumptuous Romanists forbid the reading of the Scripture
among the people; one of them affirming, That it was the devils invention to
permit the people to read the Bible: Another, That he knew certain men to be
possessed of the devil, because being but Husbandmen, they were able to
discourse of the Scriptures: All teaching, that it is the ground of Heresy,
and that Lay men are no better then Hogs and Dogs: and therefore these precious
pearls not to be committed unto them, and that the Scripture to a Lay man is
as a sword in a mad man's, or a knife in a Childs hand. Thus they practice to
imprison the Scriptures within the Priests cells, or Monks cloisters, which
were given by God, to be the light of the world: and yet (which is to be noted)
in Queen Mary's bloody and blind days, such as could dispend a certain
sum of money by the year, might read the Bible, without any special
dispensation; as if heresy builded her nest rather in the breast of the poor
man, then of the rich, or, as if the rich were less carnal then the poor:
and thus these saucy fellows handle the sacred Scripture at their pleasure,
being rightly to be branded with the name of Heretics, whom Epiphanius
generally calls Lucifugae, because they cannot abide the light of the
Scriptures, but fly from them as Owls and Bats from the light.

21. Another practice of theirs is against the sense of the Scripture, as the
two former were against the letter, that neither the body nor the soul thereof
might be left unviolated: and this is in respect of the learned, to bar them up
from controuling their errors, as the other were in respect of the simple, to
keep them from once looking into them. Their policy in this, is to interdict
all senses and expositions of the Scripture, save such as agree with the Church
of Rome, and are allowed by the Pope of Rome: this is the interdiction of the
Council of ^rent, and is grounded upon a false interpretation Conc. Trid. Sos.
4
of that article of our faith, I believe the Catholic Church: for, as
Stapleton says, The literal sense of that article is, that Stapl. des. Eccle.
potast. aduers. Whit. li. 1. c. 9. Hosius de expresso verbo dei.
thou beleeuest whatsoever the Catholic Church holds and teaches. And
Cardinal Hosius, If any man have the interpretation of the Church of Rome,
though he know not whether and how it agrees with the words of the scripture,
notwithstanding he has Ipsissimum verbum Dei. Now, by the Catholic Church
they mean the Roman Church, or rather the Roman Bishop, as I have showed:
for as Siluester says, The power of the Catholic Sum. Syluest. verb. ^ides,
nu. 2. Staplet. prae^^. Doctr. princ. fid.
Church remains only in him. And as Stapleton, The foundation of our
Religion is of necessity placed upon the authority of this man's teaching: and
therefore one ^aith, that the Pope may change ^he Gospel, and give to it
according to place and time, Henri. mag. sa^r. ^alat. adiegat. (...). Cardia.
S. Angeli ad legate. B^^em.
another sense: Yea, a blasphemous Cardi^all is b^ld to say, That if a man did
not believe that Christ is very God and Man, and the P^pe thought the same, he
should not be condemned. This is a trick p^ssing all other, whereby they not
only make sure work with the Scripture, that it never do them hurt, but also
fashion the sacred and divine sense thereof, unto their fond and foolish
fancies, and make it speak, not what the Holy Ghost intends, but what they
imagine. Nay, they are Cusan. ep. 2. 3. 7.
so impudent as to say, That the Scripture is fitted to the time, and variably
understood, the sense thereof being one while this, and another while that,
according as it pleases the Church to change her judgment. Can there be a
greater disgrace to the Scripture then this is?

22. Add to these yet another device which is far worse then 4.
all the rest, and that is a gross and palpable wringing and wresting out of
the holy Scripture, a sense contrary to the true intendment of the place, and
fitting it strangely to their own purpose. This is a practice of theirs so
common, as that their Books swarm with nothing so much as such fond and
foolish interpretations, and so ridiculous withal, that it would make even
Heraclitus himself to laugh, if he were alive. I will here report some few of
these strange wrested Expositions, that the Reader may have a taste of them,
and so judge of the whole caske.

23. And to begin at the beginning of the Bible, Genes. 1. 16. It is written,
God created two great Lights, the greater to rule the day, and the lesser to
rule the night: that is (says Innocentius Innocent. 3. ad Constable. Imper. cap.
solit. de mayor. Molin. tom. 1. de Just. and iure.
the third, one of their own Popes: And also Molina the Jesuit, God ordained
in the Firmament of the Catholic Church two dignities, to wit, the
Pontificiall dignity, and the Regal: But that to govern the day, that is,
the Spiritualty, and is the greater: and this to rule the night, that is the
Carnalty, and is the lesser; so that how great difference is betwixt the Sun,
and the Moon, so great is there betwixt the Bishop of Rome, and a King, that
is, according to the Gloss upon the same place, seven and fifty times. So in
the 3. Gloss. in ca. solit. de mayor.
of Genesis, whereas the words of the Text are plain, He shall break thy
head, or tread upon thy head, which is the first and principal promise of the
Messiah, they contrary both to the Hebrew, and Septuagint, translate and
expound it, Ipsa, She shall: applying unto the Virgin Mary, that which properly
belongs unto Christ, even the work of our Redemption. And this
interpretation and translation of that place is approved by the Council of
Trent, in approving the vulgar Latin Conc. Trident. Bellarm.
Bible for authentical: and by Bellarmine also, who calls it a great
mystery, that in the Hebrew, a verb of the Masculine gender, is joined with a
Nowne of the foeminine; to signify, that a woman should break the serpents
head, but not by her self, but by her son: and is also so translated by our
Doway Translatours in English.

24. So again, that place in the Psalm, Psalm. 91. 13. Thou shall walk upon
the Aspe and the Cockatrice, and shall tread upon the Lion and the Dragon: Pope
Alexander the third interpreted it of himself, and the Emperor, applying the
promise Naucler. Genesis 40.
made to Christ principally, and in him to all the Elect, unto himself as
Pope, and understanding by the Aspe and Cockatrice, Lion and Dragon, the
Emperor Frederick, upon whose neck he set his foot, using those words, and
all other Kings and Emperors: and to prove that he so understood the place,
when as the Emperor disdayning this pride, made answer, Not to thee, but to
Peter: the holy Father treading on his neck, replied; Et mihi and Petro, Both
to me and to Peter. Which story, though it be branded by Baronius with the

of Constantinople, and a Venetian Historian that lived about that time: which
last only differs in the Popes alleging of the Text, for he makes the Pope,
to say, not in the second person, thou: but ambulabo, I will walk upon the
Lion and the Adder. Again, they interpret that place of Esaias 49. 23. They
shall worship toward the face of the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet,
as a Prophecy of the Popes sublimitie. For, says Turrian the Jesuit, Where
is this verified, but Turrian. cont. Sadoel. page 14.
in the kissing of the feet of the Bishop of Rome? and yet who knows not,
that this is nothing else, but a manifest prediction of the glory of the
Church, and the conversion and subjection of Kings and Princes to the Religion
of Christ? What a wresting of Scripture call you this? Are not these strange
interpretations?

25. But yet hear them which are more strange and ridiculous: In the 28. of
Esaias, 16. verse we read, Behold, I will I^^y 28. 16.
lay in Sion a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure
foundation. This all know, being taught by the interpretation of S. Peter, 1.
Pet. 2. 6. is to be understood of Christ only and 1. Pet 2. 6. Bell. praefat. de
Romans Pontif.
none other; yet Bellarmine understands by this tried precious corner stone,
not Christ, but Peter, that is, as he says, Seeds Romana, The Roman Sea.
Again, we read, Iere. 26. 14. Behold, Ier. 26. 14.
I am in your hands, do with me as you think good and right. This Text

the Priests hands at the Mass, as a Prisoner, not to be let go, till he
have paid his ransom, that is, till he have given remission of sins,
contrary to the manifest sense of the place, Hosea 1. 11. We read, that the
children of Judah and Israel Hosea 1. 11.

that, Ioh. 10. 16. There shall be one fold and one Ioh. 10. 16. Job. de Par. de

shepherd, which places properly appertayning to Christ and his Church, are
ordinarily and blasphemously alleged, to prove, that the Pope is the head of
the Church. Again, Cant. 5. 11. His head is as fine gold. And Cant. 7. 5. Thy
head is like the mount Carmel. One of which is the speech of the Church to
Christ, and the other of Christ to the Church: but Bellarmine Bell. ibid.
interprets the first to be spoken Christ, and the second of the Pope. These be
his words: The Bridegroom compares the head of his Spouse to mount Carmel,
because though the Pope be a great mountain, yet he is nothing but earth, that
is, a man: and the Bride compares the Bridegromes head to the best gold,
because the head of Christ is God.

26. But let us come a little to the new Testament: are they any thing more
shie and cautelous in this then in the old? Hear and then judge. Matthew. 28.
18. our Savior says to his Disciples, All power is given unto me in heaven
and earth. This in the book of Ceremonies, is expounded of Lib. Ceremon. tit.
7. Council. Later. sub Leon. Decim. Luke 22. 38.
the Pope; and also by Stephen the Archbishop of Patauy, in the Council of
Laterane, Luc. 22. 38. the Apostles say unto Christ, Behold two swords: and he
answered, It is sufficient. By this place of Scripture, Boniface the eighth
challenged to himself both temporal and ecclesiastical authority, because
Christ said two swords were sufficient, and bade Peter not cast Bell de Romans
Pontif. l. 5. c. 7.
away one of them, but put it up into the sheath. This exposition flat contrary
to the meaning of the Text, was not only devised by a Pope, but also approved
by Bellarmine, and Molina Molin. lib. 1. de ^ure. tract. 2. dis. 29. Balb. lib.
de coronat.
the Jesuit, and Balbus with diverse others, though (I confess) rejected by
Stella, Maldonate, and Arias Montanus. But what are these to a Pope that cannot
err, and to such an Emminent Cardinal as Bellarmine is? So likewise, they
expound that Text, Matthew. 17. 24. Solue pro te and me, Pay for Math. 17. 24.
thee and me: To signify, that Christ's family has two heads, to wit, Christ
and Peter, because they two only paid, and that Peter was chief over the rest
of the Apostles, because none of the rest paid: as if paying of tribute was a
sign of preeminence, and not rather of subjection, as Iansenius expounds it.

Peter, kill and eat, to prove the Popes power to excommunicate the Venetians.
Kill, that is, excommunicate, and eat, that is, bring them to the obedience of
the Church of Rome. This is goodly stuff indeed: sure they stand in need of
arguments to prove their cause, that are driven to these silly shifts. So our
Countryman Fisher, to prove justification by works, alleges that Text of S.
Peter, 1. Pet. 4. 8. Love covers the multitude of sins, which he expounds
thus, that love expiateth and purges away the guilt of our sins in the sight
of God, contrary to the direct sense of the holy Ghost, Pro. 10. 12.

27. It is a wonder to see, how both Bellarmine and all the Patrones of
Purgatory wring and wrest the Scripture, to underprop the Popes Kitchen: The
Scripture cannot name fire and purging, but presently there is Purgatory, as
Esaias Esaias 4. 4 and 9. 18. Mal. 3. 3. Zachar. 9. 11. Phil. 2. 10. Apoc. 5. 3.
4. 4. and 9. 18. Mal. 3. 3. nor a lake where there is no water, but there is
Purgatory, as Zachar. 9. 11. nor things under the earth, Phil. 2. 10. Apoc. 5.
3. but there is Purgatory: and yet they themselves confess, that they know not
whether it be under the earth or no, because the Church has not yet defined
where it is. And Bellarmine brings in eight diverse Bell. de Purgat. lib. 2.
cap. 6.
opinions, touching the place of Purgatory: but two of their expositions
touching Purgatory, I cannot ouerpasse, left I should deprive the Reader of
matter of laughter in the midst of this serious discourse, and them of
commendation of wit; for they are witty above measure: the one is, Mar. 13. 34.
Mark 13. 34.
where it is said in a Parable, that a certain man going into Chemnit. exam.
de Purga. p. 130
a strange Country, leaves his house, and gives authority to his servants,
and commands the Porter to watch. This man going into a strange Country,
signifies the soul (say they) which by death departs out of this world: his
leaving authority with his servants, signifies, that he commands his
executors, to procure with his goods the prayers and suffrages of the Church,
whereby he may be freed from Purgatory: he commands the Porter to watch,
that is, he gives part of his goods to his Pastor, that he may diligently
sacrifice for him by saying Mass. Who can doubt of Purgatory, that is thus
authentically proved? The second place is in the 8. Psalm 7. Thou have put all
things Psalm. 8. ^.
under his feet, fowls of the air, that is (say they) the Angels in heaven,
beasts of the field, that is, the godly in this life, and fish of the Sea, that
is, the souls in Purgatory. Here is a proof of Purgatory worthy the noting.

28. And thus much for a taste of their false and foolish expositions; these
being not the hundredth part of them, which are found in their writings. Let all
men judge now, whether these men deal well with the Scriptures or no, and
whether they be friends or enemies to the sacred word of God, and the Spirit of
God that animateth it, that dare thus wretchedly abuse it at their pleasures,
and wring it like a nose of wax, into any shape to make it serve their
purpose. Erasmus places Eras. encom. Moriae.
that Friar in the Ship of fools, that being asked what Text he had in the
Scripture, for the putting of Heretics to death, produced that of S. Paul,
Tit. 3. 10. Haereticum hominem Tit. 3. 10.
post vnam aut alteram admonitionem deuita, that is in true construing, Shun
an Heretic after the first or second admonition: but he construed it thus, De
vita supple toll, that is, Kill an Heretic after, etc. This fellow by Erasmus
opinion, was worthy of a Garland, or rather of a Cockscomb for his witty
exposition: and so was he also, that being asked where he found the Virgin
Mary in the old Testament, answered, In the first of Genesis, in this Text:
Deus vocauit congregationem aquarum Maria. But I must not be so saucy with
Popes and Cardinals. I judge them not therefore, but leave them to the
judgment of God.

29. Their last practice against the Scriptures, is their adding to and
detracting from it at their pleasure, whatsoever either distasteth their
Palate, or may seem to make for their profit: which notwithstanding has a woe
denounced against it. And Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Revel. 22. 18. Fell. de mayor. and ^^ed.
c. fin.
this practice is grounded upon a rule, Papa potest tollere ius diuinum ex
part, non in totum, The Pope may take away (say they) the law of God in part,
but not in whole; and if he may take away, then may he add also: for the same
reason is of both, and one is as lawful as the other; for adding, mark their
practice, the Council of Trent, together with most of the Con^. Trid. Ses. 4.

the same mind: and yet the Jews before Christ, who were the only Church of

Jesuit names them, that is, The keepers and treasurers of the holy
Scriptures, and to whom were committed the Oracles of God, Romans 3. 2. These
Jews, I say, never admitted of these Books as Canonical, and the Fathers for
the most part, though they held them Books profitable for instruction of
manners, yet dispunged them out of the Canon, as not of sufficient authority to
prove any points of faith, as is confessed by Bellarmine Bell. de verbo Dei.

Athanasius, accompanied with many other Divines, as he says: and besides, the
Books themselves, by many pregnant proofs derived out of their own sides,
do be wray that they are not of the same spirit the Canonical Scripture is
of. Ioh. Bale in vita eius. Did. 19. cap. in Canonicis Rubrie.


30. Again, they add to the Scriptures their Decretals and Traditions.
Innocentius the third, commanded the Canon of the Mass to be held equal to
the words of the Gospel, and it is in one of their Books, Inter Canonicas
Scripturas decretales Epistolae connumerantur, (that is) The Decretall Epistles
are numbered among these Canonical Scriptures. As for Traditions, I have showed
before, that it is a decree of the Council of Trent, that they are to be
received with as great affection of piety and reverence, as the written Word of
God. Again, they add unto the Scripture, when they take upon them to make new
articles of faith, which have no ground nor footing in the Scriptures: for unto
the twelve articles of the Apostles Creed, the Council of Trent adds twelve
more, as may appear in the Bull of Pius the fourth, in that public Bull Pij
4. super form. Iuram. profes. fid.
profession of the Orthodoxall faith, uniformly to be observed and professed
of all: And when they add unto the two Sacraments ordained by Christ, five
other devised in the forge of their own brains: and those two also, they so
sophisticate with their idle and braine-sicke Ceremonies, as the Eucharist with
elevation, adoration, circumgostation, and such like trumperie, and Baptism
with oil, and spittle, and salt, and coniuring, and crossing, etc. that they
make them rather Pageants to move gazing, then Sacraments for edifying: and
thus most wrongfully they add unto the Scripture, even what they themselves
list.

31. As for their detracting and taking away, they show themselves no less
impudent, for they have taken away the second Commandment, as appears in
diverse of their Catechismes and Masse-bookes, because it cutteth the throat of
their Idolatry wholly out of the Decalogue: and to make up the number of ten,
they divide the last Commandment into two, contrary to all reason and
authority: Yea, so impudent Vasq. li 2. disp. 4 ca. 4. nu. 83. and cap. 7. nu.

Trid. Ses. 1; Catha. adu. Noua. Dogma. Caiet. pa. 1. and inde.
are they, that two famous Jesuits, Vasques and Azorius do boldy affirm,
that this second precept which forbids worshipping of Images, was not of the
law of nature, but only a positive Ceremonial and Temporal Iniunction, which
was to cease in the time of the Gospel: and in the Eucharist, whereas Christ
ordained the Sacrament of his body and blood in two kinds, they
notwithstanding deprive the people of the cup, and will have it administered to
them but in one kind: Yea, Cardinal Caietane, as Catharinus testifies of
Catha. adu. Noua. Dogma. Caiet. pa. 1. and inde.
him, cut off from the Scripture, the last Chapter of S. Marks Gospel, some
parcels of Saint Luke, the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Epistle of James, the
second Epistle of Peter, the second and third of John, and the Epistle of Jude:
and yet this man's writings were not disallowed in the church, as containing any
thing contrary to wholesome doctrine, and he himself acknowledged to be an
incomparable Divine, and the learned of all his age: and thus we see both
the doctrines and practices of the Church of Rome, against the Scripture.

32. To the which if we add their open blasphemies and horrible reproaches
wherewith in plain downright blows they rent and tear in pieces, or at
leastwise besmeare and defile these holy writings, then their malice against
them will be known to all men, and there will be no vizard left to mask it
withal. To conclude therefore, some of them call the Scripture a dumb Judge,
some a dead Letter, and without Pigh. hiearch. l. 1 cap. 2. cont. 3. Sal. com.

a Soul, others, dead Ink, others, a Nose of Wax, to be wreathed this way,
or that way: others say, that it is no better then Aesops Fables, without the
authority of the Church: all of them join in this, that it is not simply
necessary, that it was written not to rule our faith, but to be ruled by it,
and that Christ never commanded his Apostles to write any Scripture, and that
it is subject and inferior to the Church: all these, and many other bitter and
blasphemous speeches they belch out against the Scripture: whereby they
plainly bewray their cankred hatred against the Scripture; and all because
they find it contrary to their humor, and an enemy to their Religion.

33. Thus the Minor proposition in this demonstration is, I hope, sufficiently
proved, to wit, that the Religion of the Church of Rome does professedly
disgrace the holy Scripture, as both by their doctrine, their practice, and
their blasphemous speeches against it, does manifestly appear: and so the
conclusion is of necessary and undeniable consequence, that therefore it
deserves to be suspected and rejected of all those that profess themselves to
be friends to the Scripture, and hope from it either consolation in this life,
or salvation in the life to come.

MOTIVE. VII. That Religion is to be abhorred, which maintains, commands,
and practices gross and palpable Idolatry; but so does the Religion of the
Church of Rome: Ergo, etc.
WHen I consider the fearful Idolatry of the Church of Rome, which for that
cause is called The Whore of Babylon, and The Mother of fornications, Revel.
17. 1. 2. I Revel. 17. 1. 2.
cannot choose but wonder, that any should be so bewitched with the sorceries
of this Iezabel, or made drunk with the wine of her fornication, that they
should take her mark upon their forheads, and right hands, and join with her
in her abominations: and not rather come out of her with all speed, as they are
admonished by the Angel, lest they be partakers in her sins, and have a
share also with her in her Revel. 18. 4.
plagues: but then again, remembering that which S. Paul faith, that the
coming of Antichrist should be in all deceiueablenesse of unrighteousness,
and that God should send upon 2. These. 2. 10. 1^
them strong delusion to believe lies: I turn my wondering at their
sottishness into the admiration at Gods Justice and Truth: the one in
punishing their contempt of his Gospel, with such a giddiness of spirit: and
the other in making good his own word after such an evident and manifest
manner, that there by it most clearly appears, that the Pope of Rome is that
Man of sin, and Son of perdition there spoken of, even that Antichrist
which exalts himself above all that is called God, and sits in the Temple
of God, as if he were God. As this appears in many gross errors which they
hold, so in none more, then in the horrible idolatry practiced and preached,
and defended in this Antichristian Church; of which I may truly say, as
Plutarch said of the heathen, Plutarch in vit* Romul.
that they mingle heaven with earth, because they made Gods of men, and men of
Gods: So these, whilst they give divine worship to earthly creatures, as the
cross and pictures of Christ, and to the Saints in heaven; or attribute
earthly affections, to heavenly creatures, make a plain mixture of heaven and
earth, spoiling the Creator of his honor, due unto his Dietie, and adorning
the creature therewith; and ascribing that unto men, which is only proper unto
God. That the Church of Rome is guilty of this impiety, I hope by Gods grace so
to prove in this Motive, that no Jesuit (though never so subtle) shall be
able with any show of sound reason to hiss against.

2. The first proposition in this Argument, though it be of MAYOR.
so evident a truth, that it needs no further demonstration, yet because S.
Paul says, that an Idol is nothing in the world, and thereupon, some may
peradventure conclude, that Idolatry is a matter of nothing, and a small and
triuiall sin: I will therefore very briefly show the greatness and
haynousnesse of this sin, and how odious and abominable it is in the sight of
God. As touching therefore that phrase of Saint Paul, An Idol is nothing, it
is not to be understood, either in respect of matter, for every Idol has a
material being, Exodus 32. 4.
and subsisting, as the matter of the Calfe, which the Israelites made in the
Wilderness, was gold, and of the brazen serpent, 2. Reg. 18. 4.
which was abused also as an Idol, was brass, and of those Idols, which the
Prophet Esaias declameth so against, were Esaias 44. 10. Bell. de Imag. lib. 2. c.
5. Caiet* in loc.
wood: nor yet in respect of form, as Bellarmine and Caietane would have it.
As though the Apostle should mean thus, that an Idol, though it has matter,
yet it has no form, that is to say, is the representation of such a thing as
has no being in nature: for many of the Idols of the Gentiles were of such
things as truly were: but the Apostles meaning is, as Tertullian observes, and
many other, both of ancient Tertul. de core. milit. cap. 7.
and late Writers, that an Idol is nothing in respect of that which it is
intended to be, that is, that it is no God, nor has any part of the Divinity
in it, which deserves to be worshipped: or that it is nothing in regard of
efficacy and power, that is, as the Psalmist speaks, is not able to do
either good or bad, to hurt, or to help; to save, or to kill: and this
interpretation is authorized by S. Augustine and S. Chrysostom, Chrysostom. hom.
20. in Epist. 1. ad Corin. Aug. cont. Faust. Manich. l. 20. c. 5
the one saying thus, There are Idols indeed, but they can do nothing,
neither are they Gods: the other thus, Sunt Idola, sed ad salutem nihil sunt,
There are Idols, but they avail nothing to the attaynement of salvation: and
it is also approved by many other Expositors, both ancient and modern
Protestants and Papists, and is most agreeable to the whole current of the
Text. This then that S. Paul says, That an Idol is nothing, is both so far
from extenuating the sin of Idolatry, that it aggrauateth the same, and also
so far from clearing the Church of Rome from the guilt of that crime, that it
rather lays a greater stayne thereof upon it.

3. As for the greatness of the sin, it may appear by three considerations;
first, of the precept: for there is no one commandment of the Law so frequent
in the whole Scripture, and so strictly urged, and mounded and fenced about
with so many reasons, as that is against Idolatry: as we may see in the
Decalogue. Secondly, in respect of the punishment Exodus 20. 2. 3. 4.
denounced against, and inflicted upon the committers thereof, to wit, not
only eternal death from the justice of God, which is the wages of all sin
unrepented of: but Psalm. 97. 7. 1. Cor. 6. 9. Apoc. 21. 8. Exodus 22. 20. Deuteronomy.
17. 5 6.
also temporal death from the justice of man, as being unworthy to breathe
this common air, or to tread upon the earth, that thus sin against the
Majesty of God: and that not only the worshippers of Idols themselves, but
they that should entice or persuade any to Idolatry: The execution Deuteronomy. 13. 5.
of which Laws, we see put in practice upon the Israelites, Gods own people,
in the 32. of Exodus and 23. of Numbers. Thirdly and lastly, in respect of the
nature of the sin: which is first a senseless sin, full of folly, contrary
to the very light Psa. 115. 15. 16. Esaias 44. 9. 19.
of reason and nature, as both the Prophet David and Esaias at large prove. And
secondly, a sin, full of impiety, because they that worship an Idol, worship
the Devil, as S. Paul affirms, 1. Cor. 10. 20. And lastly, a sin most
opposite to the 1. Cor. 10. 20.
glory of God, and consequently sooner procuring the vengeance of God, then any
other; for it is called in the Scripture spiritual forn^cation and adultery,
because the Idolater Esaias 57. 7. 8. Ier. 3. 6. 7. Ezech. 16. 15.
forsakes God, and prostituteth himself to an Idol, and that in Gods
presence. And therefore as corporal fornication is the only cause of divorce
betwixt man and wife: so this sin only causes God to divorce himself from
his Church, and to take from her all her ornaments and Jewels, that is, his
Word and Sacraments, and to give her over into the hands of her enemies. Thus
the greatness of this sin of Idolatry, is manifest, and from thence I may
conclude my first proposition, that that Religion which maintayneth and
commands this sin, so full of folly, impiety, and contrariety to God, is
worthy not only to be suspected, but even abhorred, and detested of all men.

4. But let us come to the examination of the second proposition, MINOR.
to wit, whether the Church of Rome be guilty of this great sin or no. The
Romanists mainly deny it, as they have great reason: for if their Religion be
proved to maintain Idolatry, they know that it must needs fall to the
ground: and therefore they devise all manner of shifts, to deliver themselves
from this imputation. But we on the other side confidently affirm it, and that
the world may see, we do it not without great reason, we confirm our
affirmation with this strong argument: Whosoever ascribes divine honor to any
creature, is an Idolater: but the Romanists ascribe divine honor to many
creatures, therefore they are Idolaters: and lest any should think this to be
the error of private persons, and not the heresy of their Religion, I add
unto the Minor, that all the Romanists do this from the very grounds of their
faith, and that in so doing, they are warranted from their Religion it self.

5. They deny both the Mayor and Minor proposition in this argument, and in
denying them, especially the Mayor, they give just cause of vehement suspicion,
if not of plain demonstration, that they are guilty of the crime whereof we
accuse them: for if a thief standing at the bar, being accused of a robbery
by the high way side should answer that to take money from a man by the high
way side at Nooneday, was not theft, all men would think that he was guilty
of the robbery, and so the Jury would find him: then certainly the
Romanists, by denying this to be the true definition of Idolatry, which is
propounded in the first proposition, bewray their own guiltiness, and give us
more cause to suspect them, then we had before.

6. But let us hear their shifts: they principally are two, one of Bellarmine,
the other of Valentia, two maine posts in the house of Popery. Bellarmine would
feign undermine this proposition ( to give to creatures divine honor, is
Idolatry) by a Bell. de Ecclestriumph. l. 2. c. 5.
distinction betwixt an Idol and an Image, affirming that an Image is the
similitude of a thing that has a true being, but an Idol of a sained thing,
that indeed is not: and thereupon he seems to conclude, that to ascribe divine
honor to some Images, is not Idolatry, because every Image is not an Idol. In
the proof of this distinction he labors much, and profits little: for like
the heedlesse fish, he leapes out of the Drying Pan into the fire, and ties
the knot faster which he would seem to untie: for first, all the Idolatry of
the Church of Rome consists not in worshipping of Images, but in many other
things, as shall appear in the Discourse following. Secondly, if to worship
the Image of a true thing, be not Idolatry, then the Gentiles were not
Idolaters in worshipping the Image of Jupiter, and Mars, and Diana, and
Romulus, and Aesculapius, and the Sun, because (as Bellarmine himself
confesses) all the Idols of the Gentiles were the statues of Ibid. cap. 8.
Aug. cont. Faust. lib. 20. cap. 3.
men. And Saint Augustine also affirms, That the Gentiles did worship those
things which were in being, but were not to be worshipped: and then the
Israelites did not commit Idolatry in the Wilderness, when they adored the
golden Calfe, nor was that Calfe an Idol, contrary to the express Text of
Scripture, Acts 7. 41. because it was a representation of a true Acts 7. 41.
Exodus 32. 5.
thing, namely, of the true Jehovah, as it is evident, Exodus 32. 5. Thirdly,
let it be granted, that an Idol is only the similitude of an imaginary and
fained thing; yet will not this acquit them of Idolatry, seeing they worship
in the Romish Church, the Images of things which either never were, or were not
such as they are taken to be, as the Image of S. Katharine, and Saint
Christopher, and Saint George, and such others: the truth whereof they are not
able to prove by any approved History: Nay it is confessed, that many are
worshipped in the Church as Saints, which are tormented in hell fire for their
sins. This shift therefore of Bellarmine, to wipe off the blot of Idolatry,
is but a silly one, and blurres them more then they were before.

7. Gregory de Valentia labors to creep out at another Greg. de Valent. de
Idol. li. 2. ca. 7.
hole, to wit, not by a distinction, but by addition: for he would add unto
the definition of Idolatry these words, sicut Deo, as to God: and so Idolatry
should be not a giving of divine honor to a creature, but when it is so given
to the creature, as unto God. Wherein, as he unmannerly crosses Bell. de
Eccl^s. triumph. li. 2 c. 5.
his fellow Jesuit, in calling the Images of Christ, Idols, and saying, that
they are to be worshipped, latria, with divine honor, the one whereof
Bellarmine simply and absolutely Greg. de Valent. quo supra, and li. 1. cap. 5.
denies, and the other he allows, but (...), respectively; so likewise ^e
crosses reason, Scripture, Fathers, and consequently all sound divinity.

8. For Reason: If an adulteress woman being taken in b^d with another man,
should excuse her self thus, I am not guilty of adultery, because, though I
lent the use of my body to a stranger, yet I did it not to him as unto my
husband: would this excuse her? no, it would rather add unto her crime. So the
Romish harlot, committing spiritual fornication with her Idols, when she
goes about to color her crime with t^is vermillion, I give divine honor
indeed to Images, but yet not as unto God. What does she else but add car^all
impudency unto spiritual unchastity? A filthy stopple for a more filthy
bottle. Besides, which is more unreasonable, he makes things to be of a
contradictory opposition, which are one and the same in nature: for to give
divine honor to the creature, is not Idolatry (says he) but to worship a
creature as God, is Idolatry: whereas in very truth, to give divine honor to
a creature, is to worship that creature as God; and to worship a creature as
God, is no more nor less, then to give divine honor unto it, as any man of
vulgar sense may easily discern.

9. Scripture: for if none were Idolaters, but they which accounted the Idols
which they worshipped, to be very Gods: then were not the Israelites Idolaters,
when they adored the golden Calfe in the Wilderness: nor the ten Tribes,
when Exodus 32. 1 Reg. 14. 1. Reg. 18. 19.
they offered sacrifice to Ieroboams Calves at Dan, and Bethel: nor the Jews,
when they bowed the knee, and bu^nt Incense to the Image of Baal; for they did
not esteem these Images as very Gods, but in them the two former worshipped
the true God, and the latter the God of the Sidonians, which was the same: and
yet all these are condemned as Idolaters 1. Cor. 10 7. 1 Reg. 4. 9. le^. 7. 9.
in the Book of God: nay, many of the Heathen themselves were to be freed from
Idolatry; as the Athenians, who on that Altar which was dedicated to an
unknown God, worshipped ignorantly the true God, which made the world, Acts
17. 23. Acts 19. 27. (...). proae^^. com. in Epist. ad Epocs. M^nut. Foelix in

and all things that are therein, as Saint Paul declares, Acts 17. 23. and the
Ephesians, who worshipping the great Goddess Diana, did not ascribe divine
power to the Image, which was like unto a great pillar full of dugs, but unto
nature represented by that Image, or rather God the nourisher and conseruer of
nature, and of all things in nature* and the rest of the wiser rank of the
Gentiles, who as some of the Romish Writers themselves confess, worshipped
unwittingly that same God, which was preached by the Apostles: and though they
set before them diverse Images, yet their meaning was to worship in them the
true God.

10. Fathers: for all of them with one consent define Idolatry to be nothing
else, but the attributing of divine honor to the Creatures, as Thomas Aquinas
out of them all concludes, that this is Idolatry, quando honor soli Deo
debitus, exhibetur creaturae, that is, when that honor which is only due unto
God, is bestowed upon a creature. He that would see the Fathers particular
definitions hereof, let him read the places quoted in the Margent, which for
breuity sake I ouerpasse. And to conclude, to see how grossly this Jesuit does
err from the scope of truth, and how unadvisedly he brings in that fond
addition (as unto God) the Catechism of the Catech. Trid. in explic. pr^cep. 2.
Council of Trent does plainly affirm, that the Heathen set up unto God the
Images of diverse creatures, and that the Israelites worshipped the true God in
the golden Image of the Calfe. These are the two vain eu^sions of these two
great pillars, whose works are approved by the censure of the Church, to be
wholly Orthodex, and to contain nothing contrary to the Catholic verity.

11. But enough of them: let us leave the two Cubs in their holes, and come to
the hunting of the old Fox, the Idolatrous Church it self. That the Church
of Rome attributes divine honor to creatures, appears by this, because
trust, and confidence, invocation, vows, sacrifice, adoration, all which are
given by them unto creatures, are all parts of divine honor, and worship: For
trust and confidence, the Prophet Jeremy so appropriateth it to the Lord, Ier.
17. 5, 7.
that he denies it to all other, Ier. 17. 5, 7. Cursed be he that trusts in
man, and makes flesh his arm, and withdraws his heart from the Lord. And
then he adds: but, blessed be the man that trusts in the Lord, and whose
hope the Lord is: And S. Peter more plainly, 1. Pet. 5. 7. does bid us, to
cast all our 1. Pet. 5. 7.
care upon God. Now if all confidence, and our trust, or care, is to be reposed
in the Lord, then there is no part nor piece thereof to beeb stowed upon any
creature, and that as all, so only it belongs to the Lord. Christ himself
teaches, Math. 4. 10. interpreting that place of Deuteronomy. 6. 13. and 10. 20.
Math. 4. 10. Deuteronomy 6. 13. and 10. 20.
for whereas Moses says, Thou shall fear the Lord thy God and serve him.
Christ the best Expositor of the Law that ever was, himself being the end, and
perfection of the Law, does thus allege it, adding this word (only) unto the
Text, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve:
Whereby he evidently declares, that all the parts of Gods worship are to be
restrained by this word only, that is, that they so belong unto the Lord, that
it is sacrilege, if not Idolatry, to communicate them to any other, and so of
invocation, vows, sacrifice, and adoration: the Scripture Psalm. 50. 15. loel
2. 32. Romans 10. 14. Esaias 19. 21. Exodus 22. 20. Exodus 20. 5. Act. 10. 26. Apoc.
19. 10. Esaias 42 5. Hier. Ezech. l. 4. c. 14. Basil. in Psalm. 7. Aug. de vera
Re^^ c. 53. Epiphan. haeres. 79. Ambros Romans 1.
does ascribe them to God, as parts of his worship: and therefore by the same
rule, only to God, and none else: the reason hereof, is given by the Lord
himself, Esai. 42. 5. I am the Lord (says he) this is my name, and my glory
will I not give to any other; but his worship is his glory: therefore no part
of this may be given to any other.

12. To this also, consent all the Fathers: Jerome says, If we must put our
confidence in any, let us have our affiance in God alone. And Basil, As it is
meet to worship nothing beside God, so we must fix our hope in one God.
Augustine thus. Saints are to be honored for imitation, and not to be adored
for Religion. Epiphanius thus. Let Mary be honored, but not adored: let the
Father, Son, and holy Ghost be adored. Lastly, Ambrose determines the point
most effectually, thus. Is any so mad (says he) that will give to the Earl
the honor of the King? Yet these men (mark this, you idolatrous brood of
Babylon) do not think themselves guilty, who give the honor of Gods name to
a creature; and leaving the Lord, adore their fellow servants, as though there
were any thing more reserved for God. This is just your case, and therefore by
the judgment of this good Father, you stand as guilty before Gods judgment
seat of Idolatry.

13. But all these are but general considerations: let us therefore see in
particular, how these parts of Gods worship, are by the Religion of the Church
of Rome, assigned unto creatures, and to what creatures they are assigned, that
the Strumpet of Babylon may have no mantle to cover her uncleanness. I might
here begin with the Pope himself, and show how he is made an Idol in the
Church of Rome, and worshipped as God: yea, takes to himself the titles of
God, and suffers himself to be called God, and receives adorations,
prostrations, and kissing of the seete from all his followers: Aug. Stench.
tom. 3. l. 2. de donat. Constant. Moscon de may. milit. Eccles. lib. 2. cap.
4.
as is testified by their own corrected Canon Law, and diverse of their learned
Doctors: whereby he does plainly show himself to be Antichrist, according
to S. Paul's description. I might show also how good works, to wit,
almse-deedes, pilgrimages, works of supererogation, vowed chastity; voluntary
poverty, Monkish obedience, which they esteem the chiefest good works, are
made Idols, in that they repose the confidence of their heart, and the hope of
salvation in them through the power of meriting, which they ascribe unto them:
as also how they turn their Sacraments into Idols, by teaching, that they
confer grace, Ex opere B^l. de Sacram. l. b. 2. c. 1.
operato, by the very work done: and that effectiuely, actiuely, and
immediately, they produce in the heart, the grace of regeneration, and
justification, which is the proper and immediate work of the Godhead: but I
pass over these, and many other things, because they admit in show some
probable exception, though no sound confutation; and I insist in those things
only, in which every Idiot, and almost Infant, may discern most gross and
palpable Idolatry. And those are these five in number, the bread in the
Sacrament, Images, Relics, Angels and Saints departed. And lastly, the Cross
and Crucifix: of which in order.

14. The blessed Sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,
ordained for a perpetual remembrance of his death and passion; and for the
strengthening, and nourishing of the souls of the faithful, to eternal life,
is transhaped by them into a most horrible Idol. For this they teach and
practice, that that very thing, which to all the senses, is but bread, being
but lately molded and knead by the Baker, is to be worshipped, and adored with
divine worship, ^^l. de Sacram. Euchar. l. 4. cap. 29. Coster En^^^^. de
Euchar. Rub^^c. in Missal. Romans
because (forsooth) after consecration, it is the true and natural body of
Christ. And therefore at the Priests elevation of the host, they all fall
down upon their knees, and worship it with great devotion, and expect from it
forgiveness of their sins, and all manner of earthly and temporal
blessings, and whosoever refuses to do this, is an Heretic.

15. Their Apology is, that there is a real and natural presence of Christ's
body and blood in the Sacrament, and therefore not the bread, but the body of
Christ, into which the bread is transubstantiate, is worshipped of them, and so
they think, to free themselves. To which I answer, that if that were
certain, then their defense was just, and their practice godly, and we in
calling them Idolaters, for this cause should be slanderers of the truth: but
seeing the contrary is rather certain, to wit, that Christ is not corporally
in the Sacrament, but in heaven: and that the bread remains still true bread,
both for matter and form after consecration: they cannot be excused from
notorious Idolatry, in worshipping a piece of Bakers bread, in stead of Christ,
the eternal Son of God: for to the outward senses, it bears the shape,
taste, figure, and color of bread. This is certain, and to the understanding,
in reason it is bread, because accidents cannot be without a substance: this is
as certain, and to faith it is bread, because the Word, which is the
foundation of 1. Cor. 10. and 11
says, so calls it, after the words of consecration, neither is there any
Scripture to avouch the contrary, save that which may well receive our
interpretation as well, yea, better then theirs, as the best learned amongst
them confess: for, Bellarmine B^l de Euchar. lib. 3. c. 23.
confesses, that it may justly be doubted, whether the Text ( this is my
body) be clear enough to enforce transubstantiation. And Scotus and
Cameracensis think our opinion Sect. 4. d. 11. q. 3. tit. f. Cam^r. quaest. in
4. qu. 6. art. 2. tit. ^.
more agreeable to the words of institution: and thus they have against them
sense, and reason, and faith, and for them only a doubtful Exposition of two
or three places of Scripture; and therefore three to one but they are guilty of
Idolatry.

16. Besides, grant that there is a real transubstantiation of the bread and
wine, into the body and blood of Christ: yet the accidents of bread and wine
remain unchanged, and the form and shape. Now, howsoever the learned may here
distinguish their worship, from the outward accidents, to the inward substance;
yet the common people are not able so to do, but worship confusedly the
outward accidents together with Christ contained under them; and so in that
respect, are Idolaters also: for accidents be creatures as well as substances:
Yea, and Bellarmine also does allow them so to d^e: for thus he writes; Divine
worship does appertain to Bell. de Euchar. lib. 4. c. 29.
the Symboles and signs of bread and wine, so far forth as they are
apprehended, as being united to Christ whom they contain. Even as they that
worshipped Christ upon earth being clothed, did not worship him alone, but
after a sort his garments also. Here is a brave strain of Divinity, they
worshipped Christ in his clothes, therefore they worshipped Christ's clothes: So
Christ is worshipped under the forms of bread and wine: therefore the forms
of bread and wine must be worshipped. This is like the Ass, which bore upon
his back the Image of Isis: and when men fell down before the Image, he
thought they worshipped him: but he was corrected with a cudgel for his
sauciness; and so are they worthy for their folly, that cannot distinguish
betwixt a man and his garments, Christ and the signs of Christ, but
promiscuously confound the worship of the one with the other. Rather therefore
may we thus conclude: they which worshipped Christ on earth, did not worship
his garments that he wore: therefore they which will worship Christ in the
Sacrament, must not worship the outward Elements; and so it will follow, that
as it had been Idolatry in any to worship the garments of Christ: so it is in
the Romanists, to worship the accidents of bread and wine.

17. Lastly, let it be supposed, that there is such a real presence of Christ
in the Sacrament; yet according to the doctrine of the Church of Rome, no man
can be certain when it is, because it depends upon the intention of the
Priest: for Sum. Rosel. verb. Lu^har. 3. nu. 47 Fr. Quand. 4. ^. 13. Pro. 6.
thus they teach, if the Priest should say the words of consecration, without
intention to consecrate the bread and wine, he should effect nothing: or if he
intend to consecrate but one host, and there chance to be two, or more, then
nothing is consecrated at all: and so the intention of the Priest, being
uncertain to the people, there must needs be an uncertain adoration: and the
Priest oftentimes intending nothing less, then the matter it self which he
has in hand, there must needs be certain and undoubted Idolatry: for if the
bread and wine be not effectually consecrated, as they are not without the
Priests intention, then Christ is not really present; and so nothing is
worshipped, but the bare bread: for remedy hereof, they have devised two poor
shifts: one, that the people must adore upon a condition, to wit, if the due
form in consecrating be observed: the other, that an actual intention is not
necessarily required, but only a vertuall, that is, when an actual intention
to consecrate, is not present at the very time of consecration, by reason of
some vagation of the mind, yet it was present a little before, the operation
is in virtue thereof.

18. This is Bellarmines. But to the first, I answer, That though the people
ought to do so, that is, adore upon condition; which notwithstanding, is a
thing never heard of before in any divine worship, and implies necessity of
danger; yet because not one amongst a thousand do so, having never heard that
distinction once named in their lives, nor understanding what it means,
therefore they are for this never a whit freed from Idolatry. To the second, I
answer, that oftentimes the Priest has neither actual nor vertuall
intention: for what intent had the Monk Bernhardine, that poisoned Egnat.
the host, to the intent that he might poison the Emperor Henry of
Lucenburgh, as he also did at the instigation of Robert King of Sicily? What
intent had that Priest, that Spondan Annal. Eccles. an. 1055. Volateran.
Houed^n. Math. Paris.
either did, or would have poisoned Pope Victor the second, as witnesses
Baronius? or those Priests that poisoned William Archbishop of York? for he
was poisoned at the Mass, by the treason of his own Chaplins: both with that,
which was in the Chalice. If the Priest be an Athiest, as many of the Popes
themselves were, what intention have they of consecrating Christ's body, when
they believe not that Christ has a body, or that there is a Christ now living
in the heavens, and sitting at the right hand of his Father, to be present in
the Sacrament? or what intention can they have to do that which the Church
does, when as they believe not, that there is a Church: but that all Religion
is a fable, and a matter of policy? Here must needs be gross and notable
Idolatry, by their own confession: for I argue, Ex concessis, that is, out of
their own grounds. So that we must justly conclude, notwithstanding all their
distinctions and shifts, that the Church of Rome, in worshipping the
consecrated host, and that with such worship, as is due unto God, is guilty of
Artolatry, that is, of worshipping a piece of bread, in stead of God, then
which, what can be more Heathenish and palpable Idolatry?

19. Secondly, we indite them of Idolatry, for that they 2.
teach, that Images are to be worshipped with divine worship: and in their
practice, they give unto stocks and stones the honor which belongs unto
God. For this is their doctrine, that the Images of the blessed Trinity, and of
Christ, and of the Virgin Mary the mother of Christ, and of other Saints, are
to be had and retained, especially in Churches: Council. Trid. decret. de Imag.
ijsque debitum honorem and venerationem impertiandam, and that due honor and
worship is to be given unto them: they be the words of the Council of Trent.
Now, what that due honor and worship is, that is a great question among them:
some think it is the same which appertains to the persons whom they
represent; as if it be the Image of God or Christ: then it is to be worshipped,
latria, that is, with the highest degree of worship: if of the Virgin Mary,
then with a little lower degree called (...), if of the Saints, then with the
lowest, which they call (...), and this is the tenet of many of their Rabbis
(as reports Vasques the Jesuit) to wit, Aquinas, Vide Vasq. Jesuit. de
adorat.
Caietane, Bonauenture, Alexander, Coster, and diverse others. Others think,
that the Image is not to be worshipped at all: but only the Samplar before the
Image. Of this opinion were Durandus, Alphonsus de Castro, and some others,
Bell. d Imag. cap. 20. Durand. lib. 3. sent. d. 9. q. 2. Alphons. de Castro.
verb. Imag.
but it is confuted by Catharine, and utterly rejected by Bellarmine. A third
sort were of opinion, that Images ought to be worshipped in themselves, and
properly with a less honor then the Samplar: and therefore that no Image was
to be worshipped with Latria. Of this opinion were Peresius, Catharinus,
Sanders, Gabriel, etc. But the Council of Trent, which is their Church, in the
words of the decree, and Bellarmine Bell. de Imag. cap. 20.
which is their chief champion, do manifestly incline to the first opinion:
for this is the sum of his propositions: First, Ibid. cap. 22. 23. 24.
that the Images of Christ, and the Saints are to be worshipped, not only by
accident, and improperly, but even by themselves, and properly: so that they
do limit the worship, as they are Images; and not only as they stand in stead
of their patterns. Secondly, that in truth and deed, Images may be worshipped
with the same kind of worship which belongs unto their patterns, improperly,
and by accident, and so with Latria in that condition. Thirdly, and lastly,
that though this be true, yet especially in the pulpits, and before the people,
it is P^aesertim in concione ad populum.
not to be said that Images are to be worshipped with this kind of worship,
but rather the contrary. Here is excellent divinity: the people must not be
taught the truth, nay the contrary rather, which is a lie, and that in the
pulpit: behold here a doctor of lies, and that by his own confession, whilst
he goes about to maintain Images, which Habacuk calls, Habac. 2. 18.
doctors of lies. Hab. 2* 18.

20. This is the sum of their doctrine. Out of all which these three
conclusions do arise. First, that the blessed Trinity, that sacred and
incomprehensible deity, by their doctrine may be pictured on a wall, and
worshipped in or at an Image; yea, that such an Image ought at least improperly
be worshipped with the same worship that is due unto God himself: as when they
picture God the Father in the similitude of an old man, and God the Son in the
likeness of a young child, and God the holy Ghost in the likeness of a Dove,
which the Scripture in the second Commandment condemns as Idolatry: and
that the intendment of that Commandment is not against the Images of false
gods only, as the Romanists would have it, but also of the true Jehovah: Moses
the best expounder of himself, teaches most plainly, Deuteronomy. 4. 16. when he
says, Deuteronomy. 4. 16.
Take heed that you make not to your selves any graven Image, or representation
of any figure: for you saw no Image in the day that the Lord spoke unto you in
Horeb, out of the midst of the fire: and the Prophet Esaias confirming the same
exposition, says, To whom will you liken God? or what similitude will ye set
up unto him? Esaias 40. 18. as if he should say, it is impossible to represent
Esaias 40. 18.
God by any likeness or similitude. If they reply that they worship not the
Image, but God in the Image, I answer, First, that the very Image of God is an
Idol by this Commandment: and therefore, the erecting of it to a religious
use, is Idolatry. Secondly, that it is false which they say, that they worship
not the Image, but God in the Image: for their doctrine is contrary, as has
been showed, and their practice is contrary, as shall be declared hereafter.
Thirdly, though it be true which they allege, yet the worshipping of God
before an Image, is Idolatry: for when the children of Israel worshipped the
two golden calves at Dan and Bethel, they were not such calves, to worship the
outward calves, but God in them: and therefore the worship of them is called,
the fear of Jehovah: 1. Reg. 17. 28.
and yet they are branded for Idolaters in that respect. The like I might say
of the golden Calfe in the wilderness, and of that Image which Micha erected.
Fourthly, and lastly, that the Judge. 17.
true God worshipped in or before an Image, is made an Idol, because (as Saint
Augustine says) they that worship God in any other sort then he has
appointed, worship not him, but that which Aug. de consens. Euangel. lib. 1.
cap. 18.
they had feigned, that is, an Idol of their own fancy: and therefore the
Scripture says, when the Jews worshipped God in the golden Calfe, they turned
God into the likeness of a beast Psalm. 106. 20.
which eats grass.

21. The second conclusion to be observed, is, that by their doctrine the
Images of Christ are to be adored with such worship, as is belonging unto
Christ himself, though improperly: and that this worship is to be bounded
within the compass of the Image, without relation to the Samplar. By which is
evident: First, that by their own confession they are Idolaters improperly:
and secondly, that trust and confidence is to be put in such an Image, and
vows, and prayers, and sacrifices to be made unto it: for all these are parts
of divine worship, which must be confined to the Image, and so they are not
improperly, but properly Idolaters: and then by this we may see that the caveat
inserted in the decree of the Council of Trent, is but a mere sophistication:
for whereas the decree says, that Images must be so worshipped, that trust and
confidence be not placed in them: in affirming that some ought to be
worshipped with Latria, they enjoin plainly, that men should repose their
trust and confidence in them: and thus they bewray the fraud of the decree, and
their own secret impiety.

22. The third conclusion is that same Hyperdulia, or extraordinary reverence,
which they say is due to the Image of the blessed Virgin; and that Dulia, or
common service, which they assign to the Images of other Saints, is no less
then Idolatry, let them extenuate the matter never so much by titles and
distinctions; for it is religious worship: all which is due Revel. 19. 10. and
22. 9.
unto God only, Revel. 19. 10. and 22. 9. The Angel would not suffer John to
perform any outward worship unto him, nor so much as prostrate himself before
him; but commanded him to worship God; and yet John knew him to be but an
Angel, and therefore meant not to give him any thing but outward reverence, yet
he refused it upon this ground, that all religious worship, both outward and
inward, belongs only unto God. So Mardochee the Jew refused to bow the knee
to Haman the Agagite, because the honor which was given unto him, was more
then civil; for he was made a petty God: and therefore in the fragments of
Hester, this reason is given by himself, I did it, because I would not
prefer the honor of Hester 13. 14.
a man, before the glory of God, and would not worship any but thee, my Lord:
therefore, the bowing of the knee, or prostrating of the body after a religious
manner, is due only unto God, and is part of divine worship: to bow the knee,
and prostrate the body after a civil manner, is lawful to Kings and Princes,
and others that are either exalted in government, or endued with excellent
gifts and graces of God; but to do the same in a religious respect, is proper
only to God, because it presupposes the knowing of the heart, an
omni-presence, and an infinite power to help. And thus this same Hyperdulia
and Dulia, wherewith they worship the Image of the Virgin, and other Saints, is
open and plain Idolatry: and the rather, because it is seldom or never
severed from Latria, that is, the inward worship of the soul, which, as they
say, is only due unto God: as by their practice more plainly shall appear.

23. Thus we see the morrow and mystery of their doctrine discovered: now let
us take a view of their practice. And first, what worship can be more
performed unto God, then they give unto their Images? they kneel to them, they
pray to them, they vow vows to them, they offer offerings to them, they swear
by them, they prostrate their bodies before them: let Polydore Virgill, one of
their own sworn favorites, who would not, we may presume, speak any thing
too lauishly of his own, but rather be sparing in their disgrace, describe
their manners. Men (says he) are grown to that madness, Polyd. Virgil. de
Invent. l. 6. c. 13.
that this part of piety is little differing from flat impiety: for there are
very many of the rude and ignorant, which worship the very Images of wood or
stone, of marble, or brass, or pictures painted upon the walls, not as
figures, but even as if they had verily sense, and do put more trust in them,
then they do in Christ, or other Saints, to whom they are dedicated. Thus does
this man describe the practice of their Idolatry; and much more might be found
in him to that purpose, but that the Spanish Censours have taken order by their
Index Expurgatorius, that he shall not do them much hurt. But if this man's
testimony will not serve the turn, let us hear another of the same rank, a
man of great learning and judgment, Cornelius Cornel Agrippa de vanit. cap. 57.
Agrippa, who thus complains: The corrupt manner, and false Religion of the
Gentiles, has infected our Religion, and has brought into the Church Images
and pictures, with many vain ceremonies of external pomp, none whereof was
found amongst the first and true Christians. Hence we began to bring into our
Churches dumb Images, and to place them upon Gods Altars with great reverence,
and whither we account it unlawful for a man, the true Image of God, to
ascend, thither we translate senseless Images: to them we bow our heads, give
kisses, offer lights, hang up gifts, apply miracles, and buy pardons of them.
To conclude, to them we go a pilgrimage, to them we make vows, them we
inwardly worship, and not only outwardly adore, neither can it be uttered how
great superstition; that I may not say Idolatry, is nourished amongst the rude
and ignorant people, in Images, the Priests winking thereat, and reaping
thereby no small gain to their purses. Add unto these Cassanders testimony,
another learned man of an indifferent spirit. It is more manifest (says he)
then Cassand. consul^. de Imag.
that it needs any long explication, that the worship of Images has too much
prevailed, and that the affection, or rather superstition of the people, has
been too much favored in this regard: so that Christians seem to be nothing
inferior to Pagans, in the adoration, which they used to exhibit to their
Idols, and in the vanity, which they showed in making and adorning their
Images. And a little after, he brings in a saying of Gabriel Biell, to Gab.
Bielin ean. lect. 49.
this effect. The blockish error of certain men is so great, and they are so
affected to Images, that they think that some divine grace, or sanctity
resideth in them, by which they are able to work miracles, and give health:
and for that cause they worship them, to the end, they might obtain some such
benefit at their hands: and their simplicity is so great, that they worship
with greater devotion fair Images then foul, new then old, those that are
adorned with gold and purple, then those that are naked and bare: yea, they
make vows, and bind themselves to go a pilgrimage, now to this, now to that
Church, in regard of certain Images, supposing that greater virtues do shine
forth in one then another.

24. Thus does this learned man, together with the two former, describe the
miserable Idolatry of the Church of Rome, which is committed by the worshipping
of Images. They were all three Romanists, and no doubt, but would speak of
their own favorites as favorably as they could; and therefore we may well
imagine, that their impiety was far more gross, when it wrested out of their
own mouths this plain confession. But if a Protestant should speak, he
would tell another tale, and make them march in equipage with the Pagans in
Idolatry, as Cassander after a sort confesses; and that not without great
reason: For first, the Lactan. de fall. Relig. lib. 2. c. 20. Aug. in Psalm. 113.
con. 2. and in Psalm. 96. Chrysostom. hom. 18. in Epist. ad Ephesians. Senec. q. not,
lib. ^. cap. 45. Psalm 115.
Paynims, when they bowed to stocks and stones, pretended, that they
worshipped not the Images, but them, after whose likeness they were figured,
as testify Lactantius, Augustine, Chrysostom, and Seneca. Now the Romanists
do use the very same excuse to cloak their Idolatry, that they worship not the
Images properly, but God, Christ, Angels, Saints in them, and at them.
Secondly, the Paynims Idols are described in the 115. Psalm, To have eyes and
not to see, ears and not to hear; ^oses, and not to smell, etc. And finally,
to have no breath in their nostrils: but the Romish Images are in every respect
like unto them: let them show that their Images can hear, see, speak, smell,
and go, better then theirs, and then we will not say their Idols to be like to
theirs.

25. Peradventure they will instance in the Roode of Winchester, Polyd. Virgil.
histor. lib. 7.
which in the year of our Lord 1475. at a solemn Council there holden about
the marriage of Priests, spoke in the behalf of Dunstane against the poor
Priests, or in the Henr. Hunting. lib. 6. Baron. tom. 40. ad annum. 975.. 12.
Image of our Lady, that bade Saint Bernard good morrow, when he came into the
Church, as it is reported: or in that Image of Saint Nicholas at Chester, which
used to move the hand to bless the people: or in that Image of our Lady,
near to the Abbey of Ramsey, which used to sweat when it was offered unto; and
happy was he that could get any of that sweet sweat into his handkercheife, for
it was of sovereign use for many purposes and cures: But that they begun to
be half ashamed of such fables, especially, seeing Polidore Virgil, a man not
meanly affected toward their Religion, censured the first to be a
Legerdemaine of Dunstane to work his purpose, and reported that diverse others
used to do the same at that day. And S. Bernard in a jesting answer
discovered the second, when he answered, that it was against the Canons, for
her Ladyship to speak in the Church being a woman. And the Bishop of Chester
discredited the third, when he manifested Downam de Antich. li. 1 c. 7. pa. 102.
in the open Market place, that the Image was made with such a device, that at
the pulling of a certain string the hand would move up and down. And the
last, every old man and woman in the Country could tell to be but a iuggling
trick of a crafty Priest, first anointing the Image without, and then heating
it within (for it was hollow) with a chafingdish of coals, from whence grew
out that sovereign and excellent sweat.

26. Thirdly, the Paynim plants a tree, and after cuts it down, and with one
part thereof he warmes himself, with another part he rosts his meat; and of
the third he makes himself a God, as the Prophet Esaias says, and when he has
Esaias 44. 15. 16.
done, he censeth that Image, and lights Tapers before i^, and falls down
and worships it. They of the Romish Church do the very same by their Images in
every respect. Four^hly, the Paynims say, that Images were Elements or Letters
to Athan. orat. con. Gentes.
know God by, and they used Images and other ceremonies to procure the presence
of Angels, and celestial powers: the Romanists say and do the same; they say
that Images are Laymens Books, and that their worship of them does procure
the favor of those heavenly things whose representations they bear. Lastly,
Paynims put their trust and affiance in their Idols: so do the Romanists in
their Images, as appears by the consecration of them, and their Prayers unto
them: thus they consecrate the Image of the blessed Virgin, Sanctifica, Deus,
hanc formulam, etc. O God, sanctify this form In pontifical.
of the blessed Virgin, that it may minister the succor of wholesome help to
thy faithful people, that hurtful thunder and lightnings may be speedily
avoided, inundations of waters, commotion of war, etc. may be suppressed.
Again, thus they consecrate the Image of Saint John the Evangelist, Grant,
that all which behold this Image with devotion, and make their prayers before
it, may be heard: for what necessity soever they pray, let this Image be a holy
expulsion of devils, an aduocation of Angels, a protection of the faithful,
etc. Why should not affiance be placed in these Images that are thus
qualified? But bear their prayers; To the Image of Veronica they pray thus,

Hail, holy face, imprinted on a clont, Chemnit. exam. Council. Trident. de
Imagine.

Purge us from all sin within and without;
And join us in the fellowship of the blessed rout.
Bring us to that Country, O holy Picture,
Where we may see the face of Christ, which is most pure.
Be unto us a safe help, a sweet refreshing;
And comfort us evermore with thy blessing:
That no force of enemy may us annoy;
But that we may eternal rest enjoy.
Before the famous Image of the Lady of Lauretto, men Tursell. Jesuit. de virg.
Laur.
and women of all sorts fall down and pray, when they are in any danger, or
extremity: to her they go a pilgrimage, and as soon as they come near to the
Town of Lauretto, and behold the place where the Image is, they fall down and
worship, and so they do again at the Temple door, and after in the Temple
they humble themselves in a most servile and base manner: by all which it is
evident, that they affie and trust in the Image: as that Falkoner did, who
being upon the gallows ready to be hanged, for suspicion of conuaying away his
Masters Hawke, by only conceiving a prayer in his heart, unto this Lady of
Lauretto, the Hawke came gingling in the air, and light upon the gallows, and
so the poor man escaped the halter. He that will read the five Books of
Turselline the Jesuit, concerning this Lady, shall easily perceive that she is
made a Goddess amongst them, and worshipped with the very same worship which
is due unto God. And thus it is as clear as the Sun, both by their doctrine
and practice, that the Church of Rome by worshipping of Images, is guilty of
heathenish and abominable Idolatry.

27. Concerning the Relics of our Savior Christ and 3.
the Saints, whereof their Church has infinite numbers, there is no less
Idolatry committed to them, then was before unto Images. For first, some of
them confess, that Reliquiae eodem Vasq. de adorat. li. 3. dis. 4. cap. 2.
modo atque imagines sunt adorandae, Relics are to be worshipped after the
same manner as Images. And therefore if there be Idolatry in the one, it must
also be needs in the other: for whether the worship be not to be restrained to
the Image and Relic, but to be referred to the things whereof they are
representations and parts, as the forenamed Jesuit thinks, with some other:
or whether it is to be confined to the matter of the Relic, and form of the
Image, without further relation, as Bonauenture, Aquinas, yea, and Bellarmine
Bona. 3. d. 9. art. 1. q. 4. Aquin. in 3. d. 9. q. 1. art. 1. Bell. de Imag.
li. 2 ^a. 21.
himself, with many other, seem to auerre: yet it is Idolatry both ways,
because in both, religious worship is given to the Creatures, in the one
simply, in the other respectively, which indeed some what qualifieth the heat
of the disease, but does not at all cure the root of it.

28. Secondly, others are of opinion, that there is greater cause of
worshipping Relics, then Images: for (say they) a man cannot worship an
Image, but his thoughts must needs be carried up to the contemplation of him
whose Image it is, but reliquia solum adorantur ratione contactus, quo sunt
quodammodo Bona. Ibid. Aquin. Ibid. Marsil. in 3. q. 8. art. 2. Vasques de
adora. lib. 3. dis. 4. c. 1
sanctificatae and consecratae: Relics are to be worshipped, only in respect
of their touching of Christ, or the Saints, by which they are after a sort
sanctified, and consecrated, and therefore they may be worshipped simply by
themselves, by reason of that sanctification without Christ or the Saint, of
whom they are said to be sanctified. Here the former qualification for Images
is taken away from Relics, and therefore the Idolatry is more gross, yea, in
regard of this contaction, some of them are not ashamed to say, that the very
worms of the bodies of the dead, Vasq. Ibid. l. 3. c. 8. nu. 114.
are to be worshipped with a right intention, and with a sincere faith.
Thirdly, not to stand upon private opinions; the determination of their
representative Church, the Council Council. Trident. Decret. de Reliq. Sanctor.
of Trent, does prove the worshipping of Relics to be Idolatry: for it does
not only condemn those which refuse to give worship and honor to them in any
respect: but even those also, which opis impetrandae causa, To obtain help by
them, doenot honor them. Now hence thus I reason: to put our trust and
confidence in any creature, is Idolatry: but to seek for help at the Relics
of Saints, is to repose trust and confidence in creatures; therefore by
necessary consequence, the worship of Relics is Idolatry, because thereby
they seek for help; and so the Church of Rome is by the sentence of their
own Council, guilty of this foul sin: and this Council of theirs, is
guilty before God and man, of protecting, maintaining, and authorizing the
same: a far greater guilt then the former; by how much, according to the
rules of Law, the Author of a sin is ever more guilty then the Actor.

21. Fourthly, their practice does make this more evident: for as Cassander
ingeniously confesses, In these last times too Cassand. consult. de venerat.
Reliquiar.
much is attributed to the Relics and memories of Saints, in so much as the
better sort of men, and those that were most zealous, have placed the sum,
and substance, as it were, of Religion, in searching out such Relics,
adorning them with gold, and Jewels, and building temples and memorials for
them; and the worser and wickeder sort have reposed false confidence in the
foolish and superfluous worshipping of them. Here we s^e the practice both of
the better and the worser sort of people, that is, indeed, of all for the most
part, in the worship of Relics; the one esteeming it the chiefest part of
Religion and piety; and the other relying wholly upon it, as the only means,
for the purging away their sins, and so an occasion to harten them in the
same, because they think, as long as they perform this duty, they may sin
freely. If any man say, that the ignorance and misdoings of some, is not to be
imputed as an error to the Church: I answer, that it is not some, but all
generally, for the most part, that are thus affected: and therefore Cassander
condemns both good and bad, as guilty of this crime. But grant, that many are
otherwise minded; yet for all that, it cannot be denied, but the greater part
are in this rank: and that is enough to prove their Church Idolatrous,
because, according to the Logical axiom, every denomination is to be taken
from the greater part; neither is it a personal error, but a dogmaticall
position derived from the grounds of their Religion, as from the Council of
Trent, which allows to worship them, Opis impetrandae causa, for to obta ne
help of them, and from the rest of their great Divines: Some of whom would
have them to be worshipped with the same worship with Images, some with a
greater reverence then Images ob contactum: and they that mince it finest, with
a religious reverence, which they call adoration and veneration: in all which
is that, in a sort, either openly or covertly allowed by their doctrine, which
is practiced by their people.

30. But let us search a little further into their practice. The custom of the
Church of Rome, is to take the bodies, ashes, or bones of Saints out of their
graves, and to adorn them with gold, and silver, silk, velvet, and such like,
and to carry them about in public processions, and supplications, and to show
them to the people, to be touched, kissed, gazed upon, and adored as a singular
and meritorious service to God: is not this Idolatry? They teach, that God does
tie his grace and virtue to those Relics, whereof they are partakers, that
adore them with due reverence, and offer precious gifts unto them: yea, they
promise unto such many indulgences, and Pardons for sins. Is not this
Idolatry? Again, they teach, that their prayers are better, and more
effectual, and acceptable unto God, if they be made before the Relics of
Saints, and therefore their practice is in times of necessity, to go a
pilgrimage to such places, where the most famous Relics are; because they are
persuaded, that their prayers shall be there soonest heard of God: yea, they
make men believe, that the Eucharist has a great deal of holiness added unto
it, if Relics of Saints be included within the Altar. Is not this Idolatry?
They light up candles, and set up before them Tapers, which S. Jerome calls
Idolatriae Hieron. Epist. ad Ripar.
insignia, the Ensigns of Idolatry, and cause them to burn, even at noone
day; and that as they say, in resemblance of the golden candlestick, which
always burnt before the Arc, Exodus 2. 5. but indeed rather in imitation of
Exodus 2. 5.
the heathen, who used to burn Tapers before their Images, in the Temples of
their Gods: and therefore, me thinks, it is Baruch. 6. 18. Virgil. Aenead. 1
Bell. de reliquiis, Sanct. l. 2. c. 3.
strange, that Bellarmine should make this an argument why Relics are to be
worshipped, because Tapers and Candles are set up before them: whereas rather he
should conclude, that Idolatry is committed before them, because of this.
Again, in their solemn oaths, they touch not only the Bible, but the
Relics of Saints, and so divide the religion of an oath, which is a
principal part of Gods worship, betwixt God and them, against which a plague
is denounced by the Prophet Zephany, Zephan. 1. 5. Ier. 5. 7. Opus imperfect.
in Math. ^om. 12
Zephan. 1. 5. And it is also condemned by the Prophet Jeremy, Ier. 5. 7. And
a reason is given of it in Chrysostomes 12. Homily upon S. Matthew: at least if
it be Chrysostomes; He that swears by any thing beside God, deifies that
thing, and thereby makes himself an Idolater. Is not this then Idolatry?
Lastly, whereas in former times, where less superstition prevailed, they
placed the Relics of Saints under the Altar, as Ambrose Ambros. in Epist. ad
Soror.
witnesses of the Relics of Geruasins and Protasius. Ille (Christus
videlicet) super altar, qui pro omnibus passus est, isti sub altari qui ipsius
redempti sunt sanguine. Christ was upon the Altar, who suffered for all, the
Relics of them under the Altar, who were redeemed with his blood: yet now
Cassand. consult. de Reliq. p. 162.
(as Cassander well notes) contrary to the ancient custom, their practice is
to place the bodies of Saints upon the Altars, which place is only proper for
the body of Christ. Is not this horrible Idolatry? And yet Bellarmine would
hence prove, Bell. de Reliq lib. 2. c. 3.
that they are to be worshipped, because they are placed under the Altar,
because (forsooth) the Altar is to be worshipped: but what if the worshipping
of the Altar be Idolatry too, as without question it is, if the Altar be a dead
creature, and a heap of stones, or wood? This is to add drunkenness to
thirst, and to cover a filthy wound, with a more filthy plaster: besides, the
first bringers in of that custom, though they placed them under the Altar in a
religious manner: yet never meant, that they should be worshipped by those
that approached unto the Altar, or that they did confer any sanctity to the
Eucharist. Thus we have a short view of their superstitious and Idolatrous
practice in this point.

31. Fifthly and lastly, that they may be void of all excuse and pretext, an
infinite number of their thus worshipped Relics, are mere false and
counterfeit; not true members, parts, or remainders of any Saints, but fained
impostures of covetous Priests, and often the members not of men, but of baser
creatures. At this day (says Cassander) when the world seems Cassand. Ibid.
to be full of Relics, it may be feared, lest upon diligent examination,
most detestable frauds and impostures be found out, as it appeared sometime to
S. Martin, who found a place honored in the name of an holy Martyr, to be the
Sepulcher not of a Martyr, but of a wicked Robber. This kind of cousonage
began Aug. de oper. monach. cap 28. Gregor. lib. 3. Epist. etc.
to spring in Augustine and Gregory's times: for the one complains of
certain Hypocrites, that carried about, and boasted of the members of Martyrs,
si tamen Martyram, if so be they were Martyrs. And the other affirms, that
certain Greek Monks being found digging up the dead bodies of men, in a
certain field of Rome, confessed that they meant to carry their bones into
Greece, as the Relics of Saints.

32. But since Popery grew to perfection, this is also grown to such a height
of impudency; that it is a wonder to hear what strange Relics are to be
seen in the world. S. Peter being buried whole in one place, to wit, at Rome
in Baron. Annal. tom. 1. and 3. anno 69. and 324. Onuphr. de septem vrb.
Eccles. Bell. de Eccles. triump. lib. 2. cap. 4. Onuphr. Ibid.
the Vaticane, as Baronius writes: yet is found half in another; to wit, in
via Ostiensi, as Onuphrius testifies: and for all this, a part of him is to be
seen at Constantinople, as Bellarmine himself confesses. Nay further,
besides these three places, his head is reserved in a fourth, to wit, in the
Laterane Church at Rome, by Onuphrius testimony. And besides this whole head,
another piece of his head, in the Church of Saint Praxis; by the same Author:
and in a fixed place, one of his iaw-bones, with his beard, is kept for a
monument: this is at Poytiers in France, as witnesses Calvin: his teeth are
Calvin. admonit. de Reliquijs.
not confined to his jaws; nor yet at one place, but to be seen in many
places; at Rome in the Church of S. Vincent, and Anastasius and the holy
Cross, and S. Savior, and S. Lawrence Onuphr. Ibid. Calvin. Ibid.
without the walls: his brain is to be seen at Geneuah, at leastwise if a
Pumice stone be his brain: for it is nothing else. Many of his bones are to be
seen at Treuers, a piece of his shoulder at Rome in the Church of the holy
Cross, a toe in the Church of S. Praxis, and the joint of another in England,
Eras. pereg. resig. ergo.
at the Lady of Walsingham, as Erasmus testifies; as it were of a Giants toe:
these with many more, be the Relics of S. Peter: all which are held in great
honor and worship of them. Now either S. Peter must be a Monster, or many of
these counterfeit Relics.

33. But S. Peter is not alone in this, for Christ himself is abused: three
praepuces, or foreskinnes of his are shown, Calvin. de necessit. reformand.
Eccles.
and worshipped in three diverse places: so fourteen nails, when as he felt
but three; three coats, whereas he had but one, and that without seame, for
the which the soldiers cast losts: two titles that were set upon the Cross,
four points of the spear wherewith his side was pierced, five Linen clothes,
wherewith he was wrapped, and many such like trumperies. Nay, there is scarce a
Saint that is any thing famous, to whom they do not feign two or three bodies.
Saint Barbaries Luther. postil. in Euangel. fest. exalt. crucis.
head is to be seen in so many places, that sure, she must needs have been a
monster, if all those were true members. Saint Apollonia had so many teeth,
being all sovereign medicines Abbas Amelm. Chemnit. exam. Council. Trident. de
Reliquijs.
for the tooch-ache, that when King Edward laboring of that disease, sent
through England, for all her teeth to be brought unto him, two or three
hogsheads could not hold them that were found out. It is reported and recorded
of a certain Relicke-monger that boasted, that he carried about in a box some
feathers of the holy Ghost. Now, another merry companion stealing away these
feathers, foisted in, in their room, certain coals: The other not perceiving
the coozenage, the next day began to vaunt of his holy relickes, and to show
them to the people, which stood ready by to adore them with great reucrence:
but when he opened his caske, he found nothing but coals: whereat, being
nothing amazed, like a skillful Artisan, he turned Cat in the pan, and told the
people, that those coals were taken from under the Grediron of Saint Laurence,
when he was broyled to death: thus any thing will serve their turns for
relickes, when need requires: and so more then Egyptian is the blindness of
the Popish crew, that they believe all to be true, and take all this trash for
good ware.

33. There is almost nothing that our Savior touched, or that touched him, or
that he had any thing to do withal, but is turned into a Relicke: as the
Manger wherein he was laid at his birth, is to be seen in Rome at Saint Mary
Mayor: the Linen cloth wherein he was swadled, at Saint Paul: and another
piece at Saint Savior in Spain: his Cradle and the Shirt which his mother
made for him, at the same place: the Pillar which he leaned unto, when he
disputed with the Doctors, and the water-pot in which he turned water into
wine, which are to be seen at diverse sundry places, to wit, at Rauenna, at
Pisa, at Andegauum, and in Spain at Saint Saviors, the Table which he eat
his last Supper on, at Saint John Laterane, a piece of the bread at Saint
Saviors in Spain, the Knife where with he killed the Passover, at Treuers,
the Cup wherein he gave the Sacrament of his blood to be drunk, at Saint
Mary's near Lions, which Cup also is to be seen among the Heluians, in a
certain Monastery of the Augustine Friars: so the dish wherein the Paschall
Lamb was put, is visible at Rome, at Genua, and at Arles: so the to well
wherewith he wiped his Apostles feet, is to be seen in Rome at S. John
Laterane, and yet the same is showed at Aquae in Germany, and at Saint
Cornelius, with the mark of Judas his foot imprinted in it: a piece of one of
those loaves wherewith Christ miraculously fed the multitude in the desert, is
yet extant at Rome, at Saint Maria Noua: and another piece at Saint Saviors in
Spain.

34. What should I speak of the Cross found out by Helena? whereof, as
Histories report, she gave one part to her Son Constantine, which was placed on
a porphyrie pillar in Constantinople: and the other part enclosed in a silver
case, she sent to the Bishop of Jerusalem to be kept. It is admirable to see,
into how many pieces and patches it is now subdivided: one man was able to
bear it sixteen hundred years ago: and now sixteen men (nay, if I said a
hundred, it were not amiss) are scarce able to carry the fragments of it: yea,
they would load a whole ship, and that of good burden. The nails, as I said
before, which were but three, as all know, have spawned eleven more, and are
become fourteen, where of two are to be seen at Rome, one at Saint Hellens,
another at Saint Crosses, a third at Venice, a fourth at Seen, a fifth at Colne
in Germany at the three Mary's, a sixth at Treuers, a seventh at S. Dennis in
France, an eight at S. Sacell, a ninth with the Carmelites, a tenth among the
Biturigions, an eleventh in an Abbey, etc. his crown of thorns is divided into
so many portions, that either it must needs be of huge bigness, or else some
of those fragments which are taken for parts of it, must needs be mere
impostures: his seamelesse Coat has begot diverse others; for one is to be
seen at Argentolium, another at Treuers, a third the Turk has with him. I
should be too long in this frivolous argument, if I should reckon up all the
relics of our Savior Christ that are notoriously extant, and to all which,
worship and adoration is performed.

35. As for the Virgin Mary's relics, they are also very many and notable; her
hair and her milk are reserved in so many places, that never any woman gave
so much milk in all her time of bearing, as she did in that time that she
gave suck: her Smock is had in great honor both at Carnutis, and also at
Aquae in Germany, and is carried upon the end of a pole to be worshipped; it is
of that bigness, that the blessed Virgin should seem by it to have been a
woman of an incredible stature: which is the more to be wondered at, because
Joseph's breeches, which are carried with the smock in the same pomp, are so
little, that they would fit a little boy or adwarfe: her Kerchiefes are to be
seen, one at Treuers, another at Lisium in Italy: a little Crosse-cloth of
hers is at Bononia, her girdle at Pratum, and another at Monferrat, her
Slippers at Saint Saniacquery, her Shoo at Sanfloridum, her Combs, one at
Rome, another at Vesontium, her marriage Ring is at Perusium (as if then
marriage was made with Rings, as it is at this day) her Garments, or at least,
pieces of them are to be seen at so many places, that the Virgin Mary's
wardrobe might compare (if all were hers) with the greatest Princess in the
world; four pictures are to be seen of her, which Saint Luke himself drew.

36. What should I reckon up the Relics of other Saints, which are all of the
same nature, though not number? Saint Michaels Sword and Buckler wherewith he
overcame the devil, is a monument of great estimation, they are kept at great
Saint Michaels in France, a place much frequented by Pilgrims. And what kind of
things are they, think you? mary, the sword is like a Childs dagger that he
wears at his back, and his Buckler like a little cupping-glasse: or like the
bosse of a Bridle: fit weapons (without doubt) for an Archangell, and more fit
for him to fight with the Devil withal? What should I speak of the Relics
of Saint John Baptist? breuity bids me pass them over: and yet I cannot choose
but relate one or two which are most famous: as that finger of his wherewith he
poynted unto Christ, when he said, Behold the Lamb of God: this finger is
multiplied; for it is to be seen at Vesontium, and at Tholosse, and at Lions,
and among the Bituriges, and at Florence, and near Matiscone. Behold a wonder,
six fingers on a hand, or else one finger begetting five more, and so turned
into six, both a like miraculous: one of his shoes is in Paris among the
Carthusians, behold here another miracle, it was stolen away upon a time, and
another of a sudden came in the room thereof: sure, a shoo will never be
wanting, as long as there be Shoo-makers in Paris.

37. Such like are the relickes of the rest of the Saints, as of Peter, and
Paul, and John, and James, with the other Apostles, the Popish Churches are
replenished with the^, and some of them are in diverse places at once, after a
miraculous manner, as the Altar whereon Peter said Mass, is both to be viewed
at Rome, and at Pisa, his staff is at Colne, and at Treuers. Andrew has one
body to be seen at Tholosse, and another at Melphis: James the lesser, and
Philip, have each of them two bodies, one of them at Tholosse, another at Rome:
so also have Simon and Jude: Bartholomew is to be seen at Naples: and yet for
all that, his body is at Rome too, in a Church dedicated unto him. Matthew has
three bodies, one at Patauium, another at Rome at Saint Mary Mayor, and a third
at Treuers: the Cup wherein John the Evangelist drunk the poison, after he was
condemned by Domitian, is both at Bononia, and at Rome to be seen. Saint Anne
has three bodies, one at Apla, another at Province, and a third at Lions: and
so her head is in three places, at Treuers, at Turen, and at Thuring. Lazarus
the Brother of Marie is like wise a Giant of three bodies, one of them is at
Massilia, another at Angustodune, and the third at Auelona.

38. I^ would fill a volume, if I should reckon up all their strange relics.
Let him that desires to see more of them, read Caluins Tractate, called
Admonitio de Reliquijs, where he shall find a whole thraue of them. I for this
time end with three or four brave ones for the nonce, which are worthy never
to be forgotten. It is written of Dunstane the Abbot of Glastenbury, that as he
was hallowing a certain Church, he beheld the right thumb of Editha, then
Abbess of Wilton, Guiliel. Malmsbur. lib. 2. de Pontif. Vincent. lib. 25. cap.
33.
as she was crossing and blessing her forhead, and much delighting therein,
he took it into his hand, and said, Never might this thumb perish. By virtue
of which prayer of his, after Edithaes death, when all her body was turned into
ashes, that thumb, and another part of her body, which it seems, he had
blessed too, were found safe and sound, and so became Relics. We read also of
a certain Monk, who gave out, Verger. annot. in Catalog. haeret. an. 1559.
fol. 17.
that he had brought from the East some of the sound of the Bells, which hung in
Salomons Temple, and that he could show among other Relics, some of the
hairs which fell from the Seraphicall Angel, when he came to imprint the
five wounds of Christ in S. Frauncis body. Yea, some of them are not ashamed to
show to the Pilgrims that go to Jerusalem, a three cornerd stone, which they
bear them in hand, is that very stone, whereof David spoke, saying, The stone
Bellon. obseruat. lib. 2. c. 85.
which the builders refused, is the head of the corner. Lastly, at Cour
cheuerin near unto Blois, is kept for a monument the breath of S. Joseph,
which he breathed, when he claue wood being a Carpenter: at Burgos in Spain,
is shown a Crucifix, whose nails and beard are cut every month, they grow so
fast, and in these excrements, they say, is great virtue. At Rome is to be
seen the fore-skinne of our Savior, which was cut off at his circumcision:
and in Galicia (as Pilgrims report) are preserved some of the feathers of
certain chickens, which are of the race of that Cock, which crowed when Peter
denied his Master. And at S. Denis, is to be seen the Lantern which Judas
carried in his hand, when he came to betray his Master, with a number other such
like. These be their goodly Relics which they would have men to worship with
such great devotion: of all which, or at least, of most of them, we may truly
avouch that which Augustine says of miracles, that they are vel figmenta
mendacium hominum, vel August, de vnitat. Eccles.
portenta fallacium spirituum, That they are nothing but mere impostures, and
coozening devices, either of devils or of auaricious Priests, Friars, and
Monks, to nouzle the people in superstition, and to line their own purses
with crowns.

39. The bare narration of them is sufficient to bewray their falsehood, but
much more the Logical contrariety and natural repugnancie that is among them,
which all the wit of man is not able to reconcile. And last of all, their
nouelty for most of these Relics, was never heard of in this world for three
hundred years aft^r Christ; so that it may justly be wondered where they lay
hid all that while, and by what means they were found out at last, or how they
could continue so long. If they say, they were discovered by divine revelation,
as the bodies of Geruasius and Protasius, to S. Ambrose, Ambres. Epist. Aug.
confess. lib. 9. cap. 7. Epist. Lucian. Beda de sex aetatibus. Zozomen. lib. 7.
cap. vlt.
of Stephen and Nichodemus, to one Lu^^anus, and the head of John Baptist to
two Monks, and the bones of Abacuk and Michaeas, to a certain Bishop: and the
body of S. Barnabe, with the Gospel of S. Matthew upon his breast. I answer:
that though all these were true, yet they were not revealed to that end that
they should be worshipped: neither yet did the God of truth ever by his
testimony bolster out such notorious lies as are found in the Romish Relics.
We may confidently therefore conclude, that most abominable Idolatry is
committed in the Church of Rome, by the worshipping (at least) of false
Relics, whereof there is such a swarm: for the greatest part of their
Relics being counterfeit, the greatest part of the worship which is done unto
them, must needs be Idolatry.

40. The Jesuits, to this objection of ours, give two answers; one is
Bellarmines, who flatly denies the Relics Bell. de Eccles. triumph. li. 2 c.
4
in Churches to be counterfeit, because none are received but by the authority
of the Bishop of Rome. And as for the multiplicity of bodies, he says, that
the parts of them are often found in diverse places, and by a figure of speech,
are called by the name of the whole. But the Jesuits answer, by his leave, is
idle and frivolous: for first, all these forenamed false Relics are not
carried about by private men, but found in their Churches; and therefore if
authorized by the Popes holiness, the more shame for him, and the more
certainty for us, that he can err like a sinful man, even sitting in his
chair of doctrine. And secondly, though it were true which he says,
concerning the bodies of Saints, yet it cannot hold in other things, as in John
Baptists finger and his shoe, and the nails of Christ's cross, and the Virgin
Mary's milk, and such like. Therefore Vasques Vasques de ador^t lib. 3. cap.
8. disp. 3.
the Jesuit has devised another answer, and that is, Though the Relics be
uncertain and false, yet if they be worshipped, it is no sin, but a good
work, Because, as it is not the sin of Idolatry (says he) to worship a
beam of light, under which the devil lurketh, when a man takes it for
Christ: so if a man worship a false Relic, supposing it to be some true part
of a Saint, Merito suae deuotionis non caret, He wants not the merit of his
devotion. But this answer is not only frivolous, but impious: for by the same
reason the Jews should be cleared from sin, when they crucified Christ,
because S. Paul says, they did it through zeal, though not according to
knowledge, Romans 19. 2. and the Gentiles, when Romans 19. 2.
they put Christians to death, because our Savior says, that in so d^ing,
they thought they did God good service, John Ioh 16. 2.
16. 2. but they both sinned notwithstanding most grievously. And their own
rule is, that ignorantia non excusat a toto, sed a tanto, that is, ignorance
does not excuse the whole fault committed, but only lessens the guilt of it. I
conclude therefore, that notwithstanding all that can be said, yet in the
worshipping of Relics, is committed manifest and detestable Idolatry.

41. Nevertheless, we protest against the slanders of our adversaries, that
albeit we abhor all false and counterfeit Relics, and refuse to worship
with adoration those that are true: yet for these last sort, when they are
certainly known unto us, we give unto them a due honor and reverence: that
is, we confess them to be holy as the members of Christ, and Temples of the
holy Ghost, if they be the parts of Saints and Martyrs: we say with S.
Augustine, That their Aug. de ciuit. lib. 8. c. vlt.
memories are to be celebrated to the end (not that they may be worshipped but)
that thanks may be given to God for their victories, and we may be stirred up
to the imitation of their crowns, by calling upon God to our help. We
acknowledge with Cassander, that Vows and Pilgrimages unto places, famous for
Cassand. consult. de reliquijs.
the Relickes of Martyrs, were in old time profitable, Whilst that the memory
of the Martyrs was yet fresh and certain, and as long as God by undoubted
miracles did manifest, that their souls did live, who were thought to be
dead: and whilst all these things were referred to this end, that the
Christian faith which they by dying professed, might be confirmed (as it were)
by these signs. Yea, we affirm with Agrippa, that as Agrip. d^ vanit. cap. 57.
the abuse of Relics is an execrable wickedness; so the irreuerent contempt
of true Relickes is a detestable herfie: only the matters we speak against,
are these corruptions: first, a superstitious confidence in the worship of true
Relickes: secondly, a sacriligious forging of false ones: and thirdly and
lastly, an immoderate expending our riches in adorning and guilding the bones
and Relickes of dead men; when in the mean while we suffer the poor that
live, to famish for hunger, or to go naked for want of clothes. As the heads of
Peter and Paul are enclosed in so much silver as weighs four Com. l'ij 2.
li. 8.
thousand pounds, besides Jewels and precious stones, of inestimable price: And
the golden Tomb of Thomas of Canterbury was covered with Diamonds, Unions, and
Carbuncles, Eras. coll. de per^g. Rel. ergo.
the basest part of it was Gold. How much better might these treasures have
been employed to the relief of the poor, and other charitable uses! This is
all we find fault withal; and this is enough to prove them sensl^sse and
blind Idolaters, and their Church, which maintains all these things, an
Idolatrous synagogue.

42. The fourth maine arm of Idolatry issuing out of the 4.
body of the Romish Church, and the root of their religion is, their doctrine
and practice touching the Invocation of Saints and Angels. They maliciously
slander us, and say, that we are enemies to the Saints, and that we deny them
all honor and reverence, comparing us therefore to the Caianian and Eun^^ian
Heretics, for our wicked and sacrilegious contempt of the Saints of God, as
they falsely affirm: but we return this reproach upon themselves, and
confidently affirm, that they wrong the blessed Saints more in making them
Idols, and giving them more honor then is their due, then we do in giving
them too little, if that were true that we did so: for what can be more
injurious to the honor of those blessed Creatures, who live in the presence of
God, and sing Haleluiah to him continually, with all honor, Revel. 7.
praise, and glory be ascribed to him that sits upon the Throne, and to the
Lamb for evermore: whose chief joy and delight is to advance the honor of
the eternal God, then to have any part of that honor due unto him ascribed
unto them? they had rather be deuested of all theirs, then any jot of his glory
should be diminished. More injurious therefore are they to the Saints, if they
give them too much, and that in derogation from God, then we, if we give them
too little.

43. But we deny that we give them too little; we give them their due honor
and respect. For first, we give God thanks for them, and for the benefits
which God vouchafed by them to his Church; as the Church glorified God for the
conversion of Saint Paul, and Paul gave God thanks for the Gal. 1. 13.
graces of the Thessalonians. Secondly, we highly extol and 1. These. 1. 2.
commend the Saints departed, and magnify the graces and gifts of God in them;
we account them blessed, as the Virgin Marie prophesied of her self, that all
Nations should call her blessed: And we keep a perpetual and a reverend
remembrance Luke 1. 48.
of them, as our Savior promised to that Marie, that powered the box of
precious ointment upon his head, Mark 14. 9. Prou. 10. 6.
And Solomon confirms also to all the just, that their memorial should be
blessed. And thirdly, we propound them as examples for imitation, that their
virtues may be as patterns for us to imitate, and their falls as marks to
make us wary: and their conversation as guides and directions for us in the
way to the heavenly Canaan. Thus much honor we willingly attribute unto the
Saints: but no further dare we go, lest we derogate from the honor of God;
and in so doing, not please or content, but vex and grieve the blessed Saints,
who cast down their Crowns; that is, strippe themselves of all honor, Revel.
4. 10.
before the Throne of him that lives for ever. But the Church of Rome are so
lavish and prodigal in their honoring of them, that they despoyle God of his
honor, and inuest them therewith, committing Idolatry unto them. And this they
do three ways principally, first by outward adoration; secondly, by
invocation; and thirdly, by reposing their trust and confidence in their
merits and mediation.

44. Touching outward adoration, which consists in these things principally,
to wit, in bowing the knee, prostrating the body, dedicating Temples,
consecrating Festival days, and making vows to the Saints departed; all
which Bell de cultu Sanct. lib. 3.
outward worship the Romish Church allows, and the Popish crew afford unto
the Saints departed: it cannot by any means be esteemed any whit less then a
practice of Idolatry, seeing by their own confession, it is more then a civil
adoration, and being more then civil, it must needs be religious: for there
are but two kinds of worship commanded by the law of God, the one enjoined in
the first Table, namely, the divine worship of God: and the other in the first
commandment of the second Table, which is the honor we ought to give to our
superiors. Now this worship of Saints must of necessity be one of these: but
it is more then civil (say they) therefore it must needs be a religious and
divine worship. For thus I reason, This worshipping of Saints is either an
iniunction of the first Table, or of the second, or of neither: if they say, Of
the first, then it is divine and religious worship, for the first Table of the
Law contains under it only divine and religious duties, the object whereof
is God himself, and none other, as the several precepts thereof do declare:
if they say, Of the second, then it is mere civil and politic, for the
second Table is only a bond of civil duties: if they say, It is of neither,
the^ it must needs be a will worship, deui^ed by their own brains, and not
warranted by the word of God: which is also confessed by Eckius in his
Enchiridion, Eckius Enchir. Council. Trid. decret. de Inuocat. Sanctor.
and insinuated by the Council of Trent, when in setting down that decree, it
alleges no Scripture; but only the ancient custom of their Church, consent
of Fathers, and decrees of Councels.

45. But to the point: I say, that seeing by the rule of Gods word, we find but
two kinds of worship, one religious and divine, contained in the first Table;
the other civil and humane, enjoined in the second: If therefore the worship
of Saints be not a mere civil worship, belonging to the second Table of the
Law, then it must needs be religious, and pertain to the first and so
consequently Idolatrous. This twofold worship and no more is approved by Saint
Augustine, Aug. de ciuit. lib. 10.
who by that distinction of (...), and (...), puts difference betwixt the
worship that must be given to God, and that civil honor which is due unto
men: for by (...)* he mea^eth that kind of worship and honor, which we may
and must perform to those that excel either in place of authority, or in
gifts and graces of God, which is merely humane and civil, and by (...), that
d^uine worship which the creature owes unto the Creator only: and that
former is that which he allows only to the Saints: and that in that
acception of the word which is before specified, to wit, as it is a civil and
humane worship, as appears more evidently by that which he affirms in
another place, in these words, Aug. cont. Faust. li. 10. cap. 21.
Colimus Martyrs eo cultu dilectionis and societatis, quo and in hac vita
coluntur Sancti Dei homines, sed illos tanto deuotius, quanto securius post
incerta omnia superata. In which words it is plain, that the kind of the
worship exhibited to Saints triumphant, and Saints militant, is all one, but
the extension of it is greater to the one then the other, according to the
proporti^n of gifts and graces, more apparent in one then the other.

46. But the Romish Doctors, and principally the Jesuits, add a third kind
of worship, yea, a fourth to these two; albeit therein they neither agree with
themselves, nor with their fellows, as it commonly falls out when men build
upon their own fancies, (a rotten foundation) and not upon the word of God,
which is the ground of truth. For Bellarmine Bell. de Sanctor. beat. li. 1. ca.
12.
says, that there is a civil worship due unto men, for some civil respect:
and there is a religious worship due unto Saints, in respect of their Sanctity
and holiness, which he calls dulia; and a divine worship proper only unto
God, which he calls latria: and that middle he subdiuideth into two degrees;
the first, he says, is dulia, proprie dicta, so properly called, which agrees
to the Saints; and the second Hyperdulia, which belongs only to the humanity
of Christ, and the blessed Virgin his Mother: and so he makes four distinct
kinds of worship, whereof two are without the compass and reach of Gods
Commandments, and therefore I know not where to place them, except in the
devils. The like doctrine is delivered by Vasques another Jesuit, Vasq de
ador. li. 1. ca. 2. dis. 5. Canis. Catechis. Bell. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. 14. Vasq.
Ibid. lib. 1. cap. 1. dis. 6.
and Canisius, and almost all the rest of that Jesuitical ra^ble: but mark
their harmony; Bellarmine says, that this worship o^ Saints is Cultus, and
therefore an act of Religion, though in a secondary respect. Vasques denies
it flatly to be an act of Religion at all, but of some other virtue. Thomas
Aquinas, Bonauenture, Gabriel, and Albertus, are of mind, as testifies
Vasques, that it is one and the same kind of worship wherewith we honor men,
advanced in civil dignity, and the Saints; and that the difference is in the
degrees of proportion, not in diversity of kind. And in this they fully consent
with us, as also with Saint Augustine, and with the truth; but this is
contradicted by Bellarmine, Vasques, and all the rabble of the Jesuits, as may
appear in the places before quoted.

47. Paluda nus makes three kinds of Hyperdulia, the first due to the humanity
of Christ, for it self; the second, to the vasq. Ibid.
blessed Virgin; and the third, to the rest of the Saints: but as for dulia,
that he applies only to that honor which we owe to all reasonable creatures,
except the damned: but this is crossed by all the rest. Again, Durandus (as
Vasques reports) is of opinion, that the worship of Saints departed, and men,
in civil dignity, proceeds from one and the same virtue, Vasq. Ibid.
and differs only in the act applied unto the degrees of excellency. But
Bellarmine, Vasques, and all of that stamp, renounce utterly that opinion, as
I have showed. Lastly, Vasques that acute Jesuit, as they brag of him,
affirms, that the worship of Saints is not an act of Religion: and yet in the
same Chapter he calls it cultus sacer and religiosus, A holy and religious
worship; then which, what can be more contradictory? for if it be a religious
worship, then must it needs be a worship of religion, and an act of religion;
and if no worship of religion, then no religious worship: for coniugata (by the
rule of Logic) se inuicem ponunt and tollunt. And that which i^ to be noted
above all the rest, he is constrained to devise a new special habit of
virtue, to which this worship Vasq. Ies. Ibid.
of Saints may be referred, never heard of before, neither in Moral
Philosophy, nor yet in divinity: and that without name, and so without nature
and being, except in the Jesuits brain only. Thus we may see how error,
like Proteus, turns it self into many shapes, and at last is strangled with
it own halter.

48. But that this outward adoration of Saints departed is Idolatrous,
appears over and above that which has been said, by these reasons: first,
because they ascribe unto them a presence, not only in one place, but in all
places where they are worshipped: secondly, a power of hearing, seeing, and
helping: and thirdly, an ability of knowing and seeing the heart: all which
imply an infinite power, and such as is properly divine. And therefore it is
nothing but a vain shift, when they say they give divine worship to God, and
no more but a certain kind of service to the Saints, when in truth they give
that which is Gods to the Saints, besides touching, kneeling, and prostrating
the body in a religious manner. Peter Acts 10. 26.
refused to have it done unto him by Cornelius: and the Angel rebuked John
twice for offering it unto him: if it had Revel. 19. 22.
been lawful, sure, they would not have refused it; for neither did Cornelius
take Peter to be a God, but for a holy man: nor John, the Angel for the
Creator, but for an excellent creature, as evidently appears in the Texts;
and therefore they intended not to worship them as Gods: yet because the manner
of their worship was more then befitting a creature, having in it a touch of
divine worship and religion, therefore it was rejected; the one saying, Stand
up, for I my self am a man; insinuating, that a man must not be religiously
adored: and the other, See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow servant,
implying thereby, that Angels, and if Angels, then Saints are but our
fellow-seruants, and therefore not to be worshipped with any part of divine
and religious worship.

49. To the example of Peter, Bellarmine and Vasques Bell. de Sanctor. beat li.
1. ca. 14. Vosques de adorat. li. 1. dis. 5. c. 3
give two answers, the one out of Hierom in his Book against Vigilantius, that
Cornelius was worthily corrected by Peter, because he thought some divine thing
to be in him above othermen: the other out of Chrysostom upon this place, that
it was no fault in Cornelius to exhibit, but modesty in Peter to refuse that
honor which was due unto him. Bellarmine is in different which of these two
answers we take; and therefore without propounding his own judgment, leaves
the^ to our choice. and yet the one of them ouer-turneth the other; for Hierom
says, it was a fault in Cornelius; Chrysostom, that it was no fault: Hierom,
that Peter did well in reproving Cornelius; Chrysostom, that he did not
reprove him at all, but of modesty refused the honor given to him. What
reason had he to leave these to our choice, being thus contrary? It plainly
shows, that he knew not what to answer. Therefore Vasques the Jesuit
renounceth Hieroms answer upon this ground, that Cornelius knew the true God,
before Peter came unto him, and therefore could not err so grossly, as to
ascribe any divinity to a mortal man, and insists upon Chrysostomes, that he
did it for modesty sake: but by as good warrant we may reject Chrysostom, as
he does Hierom: especially, seeing our reason is as effectual; for Peter gives
this reason of his denial, for I my self am a man: which must needs be the
medium of a sillogisme, thus to be concluded: No religious worship is to be
given to man; but I my self am a man, therefore thou do evil to worship
me. Here is not a strayning at courtesy for modesty sake, but a plain
renunciation of Cornelius his sact as unlawful: if it had been a trick of
modesty only, he should rather have said thus comparatively, I am not worthy
of this honor from such a man as thou art, or such like: but in saying, I my
self am but a man, he insinuates, that Cornelius did more then he ought to do.

50. If they say, I but though you thus escape from Chrysostom, yet Hieroms
interpretation will hold you fast: I answer, Besides Vasques reason whereby he
rejects Hierom, that it makes nothing against us, but for us rather, and
against them, because Hierom seems to condemn as idolatrous, all such
adoration of Saints, wherein any part or property of the divine nature is
attributed unto them: but the Romanists in kneeling and prostrating their
bodies to the Saints, ascribe the properties of God unto them, to wit, either
to be present in many places at once, o^ to hear, being as far remote from
them as ^ea^en is from earth, and to know the heart, and to have power to
help, etc. all which properly are proper unto God.

51. To the example of John and the Angel, the former two Jesuits oppose also
a double answer: first, that the Angel did appear unto John in that majesty,
that he might be thought to be Christ himself: And therefore that John was
rebuked, not for the error in his adoration, but for his error in the person
adored. This answer Vasques names only, and then reiects as frivolous: But
Bellarmine propounds it as good and authentical. Which shall we believe in
this case? Ma^y, saving his reverence, though he be now a Cardinal, the
plain Jesuit is to be preferred before him, both because this answer is
crossed and contradicted by the second; and also, because the Jesuit gives a
reason of his reiection. And the Cardinal goes to it by downright
authority, as if, because he is their chief Rabbi, he may say what he list:
his reason is, because John did truly know him to be an Angel, and not God,
and therefore that there was no error in the person. Secondly, they answer,
that the Angel would not now, as in time before, be worshipped of men, because
now God was become man, and by his incarnation brought such dignity to the
nature of man, that the very Angels should do reverence unto it, not be adored
and reverenced by it; especially of Christ's Apostles, and Princes of the
Church. To which I answer, first, that by this allegation it must needs
follow, that Angels are not now to be adored in the Church of Christ,
howsoever they were before; which is contrary to their own doctrine, and
general tenent of their religion. Bell. de Sanctor. bent. li. 1 ca. 13.
Vasques de adora. lib. 1. dis. 5. c. 3
And secondly, if not Angels, then much less the Saints, who at their highest,
though they be made like, yet are far inferior to the Angels in excellency
of graces, and gifts. And th^^^ly, the reason where with the Angel, after he
had reproved John, directs him to the right object of religious worship, does
overthrow this exposition: for he says, Worship God: he does not say, Forbear
to worship me, because your nature is dignified by the incarnation of the Son
of God: but forbear, because I am not God; and all divine and religious
worship belongs unto him. And thus notwithstanding all that is yet said, all
religious kneeling and prostrating the body to the Saints, is Idolatrous.

52. As for the dedicating Temples, consecrating Festival days, making vows
to them, they are all within the same compass, and that partly for the reasons
before specified, being acts of a religious worship: but especially, because
the Bell. decult. Sanct. li. 3. c. 4. and lib. 3. ca 9. and cap. 16. Idem,
Ibid. ca. 4.
doctrine of their Church is, that these things are so properly directed unto
the Saints, that the end of their consecration is determined in them. And
therefore Bellarmine reprooues their opinion, which say, that Temples cannot
properly be erected to any, but to God: and affirms, that they may be
dedicated directly unto Saints, and that vows may be made to them
determinately; and so also Holy days consecrated: which cannot be any less
then plain Idolatry: seeing, as Saint Augustine says, Cuiconuenit Templum,
ei conuenit Aug. de ciuit. lib. 22 ca. 10.
sacrificium, to whom a Temple, to him a Sacrifice belongs. And seeing the
Scripture in many places testifies, that vows Numb. 30. 3. Deuteronomy. 23. 21. Esaias
19. 21.
must only be made to God; I am not ignorant of their cuasion, that they do
not dedicate Churches to Saints, as they are Temples; but as they are
Basilicae, that is, stately buildings for memorials of the Saints: and that a
Vow is made to God in signum gratitudinis ^rga authorem, and primum principium
omnium b^n^rum, as a sign of our thankfulness to God the author, and first
cause of all good things: but to the Saints, as a sign of gratefulness
toward our mediators and Intercessours, by whose means we receive benefits
from God. And that the honor of the holy day, though it immediately pertains
to the Saints, yet mediately and secondarily it amounts to God.

53. These be Bellarmines goodly, but scarce godly distinctions: for these, and
such like as these are, he uses as engines to undermine the truth, and as
vizards to cover the face of ugly falsehood. But they may well be overthrown
with this one blast, that the holy Scripture never taught them, neither have
they any warrant from Gods Spirit: and therefore they are rather to be
accounted forgeries of a frothy wit, then fruits of truth. But let us examine
them a little: A Church is dedicated to God as it is a Temple; and to a Saint,
as it is a Basilica, Why then it seems, that either sometimes it is a Temple,
and sometimes not a Temple, according to the fancy of those that approach unto
it: or else it is always a Temple, and yet always a Basilica too, and then
the honor must be divided betwixt God and the Saints: let them take which they
will; the first is impiety, the second Idolatry. Again, for Vows, though we
vow chiefly unto God, and secondarily to the Saints; yet the same worship in
nature is given to these as to him, only it is not in the same degree: but
Idolatry is to afford any part of Gods worship to a creature, as has been
showed. And lastly, touching feast days; if they be immediately applied to the
honor of the Saint, and in a mediate and secondarie respect to God, as his
distinction imports, then the creature is adored not only with the like
worship in nature, but with a higher degree then God himself. And thus the
mist which he seeks to cast over men's eyes, by the subtlety of his
distinctions, is quickly dispelled, as soon as the light of truth shows it
self: and therefore as Ixion, embracing a cloud, in stead of Juno, beg at a
monstrous offspring: so, the entertaining of those cloudie distinctions,
without deciphering them to the quick, has bred, and does breed most of those
monstrous errors in the Church of Rome. Thus we see, that this outward
adoration is tainted with most gross Idolatry.

54. The second branch of their Idolatry to the Saints, is, by Inuncation and
Prayer directed unto them. For, Prayer is a proper and peculiar part of Gods
worship, and therefore not to be given to any other besides, without a plain
touch of Idolatry: for the commandment of God is in the Old Psalm 5(...).
Testament, Call (...) of (...) not upon my ^^gels or my Saints, but upon
(...)nd t^^^ be alone is (...) inuocated, the reason following declares,
(...)d I will deliver thee: from whence arises this conclusion, he alone is to
be inuocated by prayer, that is able to deliver us in the day of trouble: but
God alone can do that, therefore he alone is to be prayed unto. Again, it is
the commandment of our Savior Christ in the New Testament to his whole
Church, that it should thus pray, O, our Father, not, O, our mother, nor, O,
our brother, nor, O, our sister, nor, O, our fellow-seruants, as the Popish
Church prays: but, O, our Father. If there had been any necessity of praying
to Saints, sure, our Savior would here have prescribed it, where he sets
down a perfect form of prayer to be used in his Church for ever. Infinite be
the places of Scripture ^ending to this end; neither is there so much as one
precept or example in the whole Book of God, that either inioyneth or
approves Invocation of Saints, as Cassander confesses; albeit his inference
thereupon Cassand. consult. art. 21.
is absurd, that therefore it may be done, because, as there is no mandate nor
example extant to warrant it, so there is no prohibition to interdict it: as if
it were not necessarily required, that as all our actions, so our prayers
should be grounded upon faith, without which it is not only impossible James
1. 6. Heb. 11. 6. Romans 14 23. Romans 10. 17.
to please God, but also, whatsoever we do, is sin; but says is grounded
upon the word of God only, It comes by hearing, says the Apostle, and
hearing by the word of God. How then can the Invocation of Saints be but vain
and unprofitable; yea, impious and dangerous, seeing it is without says, and
so without all hope of Gods acceptance?

55. Suarez and Salmeron, two famous Jesuits, confess Suar. in 3. Them. q 52.
d^s. 42. see 1 Salmer. com. ^^ 1 Timothy 2 dis. ^..
as much as Cassander: for the one says, that we never read that any directly
prayed unto the Saints departed, that they should pray for them: and the other,
that the Invocation of Saints is not expressed in the New Testament, because it
would have been a harsh precept to the Jews, and dangerous to the Gentiles.
Thus, here are three, and those not of the meanest, that acknowledge the
invocation of Saints, not to be found in Scripture. And yet Bellarmine and
^^^ius, and Coster, and others (...) ashamed to ^^est di(...)laces of Scripture
to prove it: but with what impude^^y of spirit, and evil success, I shall
not need to show, being sufficiently discovered by others, and the very fight
of them being a sufficient refutation.

56. As for his reason which he braggeth to be unanswerable, me thinks, it
halts of all four: for, because we entreat Gods children here in this world to
pray for us, does it therefore Bell. de Sanctor. beat. li. 1. ca. 19.
follow that we must pray unto them, being departed out of this world? By the
same reason it may be enforced, that we ought to give alms unto them, and
entertain them into our houses, and wash their feet, and comfort them, and
advise them, and preach unto them: for all these duties of charity we perform
to Saints militant. If they say, Why, but they are removed from us, and also
from their bodies; and therefore as they stand not in need of our charity, so
we cannot extend it unto them: The same answer cutteth the throat of this
argument, they are so far exalted above us, and severed from all commerce
with our affairs, that though we used their prayers here on earth, yet it is
in vain to invoke them in heaven, our prayers, as our deeds of charity,
being not able to stretch so far. This I take to be a sufficient solution to
that vnsoluble argument: Albeit, we have also another answer in readiness, to
wit, that there is not the same reason of the invocation of Saints in heaven,
as of the mutual prayers of Gods children on earth, but a great difference;
here we know one another necessities, there the Saints know Esaias 63. 16. 2.
Reg. 22. 20.
not our wants; here we are present with them whom we request to pray for us;
but we are not present with the Saints in heaven, nor they with us; and
therefore the one is a fruit of charity, but the other a practice of piety and
religion: here one living man may request another help by word of mouth or
letter: but invocation of Saints is often performed by the secret desires of
the heart, without the utterance of any speech: here we stand as fellow members
in our prayers, and make request for each other, not in our own names, but in
the name of Christ our Mediator: but when men invoke the Saints in heaven,
they make them more then their fellows, even mediators of intercession
between them and God. Lastly, for mutual praying for one another here, we
have both an express commandment, and plain examples in the word of God; but
for praying to the Saints, we have neither commandment, nor example, nor
promise in the whole Scripture.

57. But that I may leave these things, and come to the point in hand, that
Saints are made Idols by invocation, may appear by these reasons: First,
because they ascribe unto them an omnipotent power to know the heart, which is
a peculiar property belonging unto God only, Ier. 17. 10. Ier. 17. 10.
Secondly, an infinite presence in all places, and that at once: for when one
prays to Saint Peter at Rome, another at Paris, another at London, another at
Constantinople, and all at one instant, must not he needs be present in all
those places, or else how can he hear their prayers? Thirdly, a divine power
to help and deliver all those that call upon them, and that not only from
outward calamities, but from inward sins and corruptions. Fourthly, a
property belonging only unto God, namely, to be believed in: for how shall
they call upon him in whom they have not believed, says S. Paul, Romans 10. 14?
Romans 10. 14.
And lastly, a divine worship, which is sacrifice for prayer, is a spiritual
sacrifice of Christians. Heb. 13. 13. which, as all know, Heb. 13. 13. Mal. 1.
11. 1. Tim 2. 8. Aug. de ciuit. li. 8 cap. 27.
pertains only unto God. And as Saint Augustine well confesses, when he
says, We do not ordain Priests, nor offer sacrifices to the Martyrs, because
it is unfit, undue, and unlawful, and due only to God alone: and again in
the same Chapter, because not they, but their God is our God.

58. Against these arguments our adversaries make a show of opposition (and but
a show) after this manner: First, that they do not ascribe to the Saints an
omnipotent power, or an infinite presence by inuocating them; for they say,
Beatifica Bell. de Sanctor. beat. li. 1. ca. 20.
visione, by that blessed vision of God, they do behold all things which
pertain unto them to know in him, tanquam Coster. Enchir.
in speculo, as it were in a glass. Secondly, that the Saints help, not as
Authors, but as instruments and impetrators. Thirdly, that we may believe in
them, though not as in God, but as in our Patrons and Protectours. And that
Bellarmine proves by Hierome upon the Epistle to Philemon, Philem. 1. 5.
on these words, When I hear of thy love and faith which thou have toward the
Lord Jesus, and toward all Saints. Lastly, that Prayer is an improper kind of
sacrifice, so called by a figure of speech, and not so, being in it own nature.

59. But all these are but mere shifts, which may in some sort blanch the
foulness of this error to the dim eyes of the ignorant; yet those that are
quicke-sighted, can easily discern their falsehood: and therefore that I may a
little discover their iuggling, I answer to their objections in order; to the
first three things: First that t^ is glass, in which all things are said to be
seen, is no where to be found in the Scripture, and therefore is a plain
forgerie of their own brains: for we read, Mat. 5. 8. That the pure in heart
are therefore Mat 5. 8.
blessed, because they shall see God. From whence it may be gathered, that
Visio beatifica est beatitudo videntium: In the blessed sight of God consists
the happiness of the Saints: but that thereby they should behold, as it were
in a glass, all things which they would, is no where to be sound in the
Scripture of God. Secondly, it is contrary to Scripture: for Revel. 6. 9.
Revel. 6. 9.
it is said, that the Saints under the Altar cry, How long, Lord, holy and
true, will thou not revenge our blood! and Acts 2. 7. It Acts 2. 7.
is not (^aith our Sauiour-to his Apostles) in you to know the times and
seasons, which the Father has put in his own power. And that this is meant
not only of the Saints in this life, but also in heaven, appears by that
which Christ ^aith, Mat. 24. 23. that the Angels know not the hour of the last
Judgment: and if not the Angels, much less the Saints: but all these things
do in some sort pertain unto the^ as well as the prayers of the living: and
yet it is plain, that they see them not in that glass. Thirdly, if that be
certain, that they see in this glass the prayers and necessities of their
suppliants; Why does Coster and others affirm, that they attain this
knowledge Coster Enchir.
by the relation of Angels? and yet they assign to every man but one Angel:
surely, that Angel is well employed in ascending and descending every hour to
carry news to the Saints. And why do others say, that the Saints are after a
sort by a wonderful celerity of their glorified nature in every place? This is
a wonderful celerity indeed, if it were possible for them to be so; and yet be
it as they would have it, it cannot euince an audience of those prayers which
are made at one and the same instant, in diverse and far distant places. And
lastly, why do some others affirm, that they have this knowledge not by the
vision of God, but by ordinary and continual revelation from God? If by
vision, then not by revelation: and if by revelation, then not by vision. And
thus, like men in the dark, they fight with one another, and whilst they
forsake the light of the truth which shines in the word of God, they fall into
grievous errors, hammered out of their own fancies if they say it is no
matter how they know our wants* but certain it is that they do know them:
they take that for granted which is the question to be proved, and which by no
sufficient argument they can euince.

60. To the second objection I answer, that most ignorant persons esteem the
Saints, to whom they pray, as the very authors and giuers of those good things
which they pray for, without any respect unto God, save that they think he
has put them into their hands to be distributed at their pleasure; and
therefore they pray to one for their Horses, and to another for their Hogs, and
to a third for their Kine, etc. Yea, not only the simple sort do this, but it
is the doctrine of their Church, as may appear by this rhyme in their
authorized Seruice-Bookes, to the blessed Virgin.

In te pluit, inte fluit Deus suam gratiam:
Ergo tuanobis plu^ gratiae clementiam:
Ad beati tui Nati transfer prasentiam,
Et cunctorum delictorum confer indulgentiam.
That is: God raines his grace abundantly on thee:
Of that thy grace let us partakers be:
Bring us unto the presence of thy Son,
And pardon all the sins which we have done.
Here the Virgin Marie is not made the Impetrator, but the giver of grace: and
so are the rest of the Saints, as shall more fully appear in the next Section.

61. To the third I answer, that to believe in a creature, is to deifie that
creature. For as Augustine well observes, Aug. Tractat. in John 54.
We believe the Apostle, we do not believe in the Apostle: and we believe the
Church, and not in the Church: and therefore Idem ser. de temp^r. 131.
in the Apostles Creed, where we say, I believe in God; we do not say, I
believe in the Catholic Church, but I believe the Catholic Church: whereby
is plainly insinuated, that none but God is to be believed in, because to
believe in a thing, is to put our trust and confidence in that thing. As for
that place in the Epistle to Philemon, it makes nothing for this purpose; for
there the word Faith is referred to the Lord Jesus, and Love to the Saints:
neither ought Saint Hieromes authority more preiudicate us in this
interpretation, then it does them in many such like, whom they reject as they
do the rest of the Fathers, at their pleasures: especially, seeing no man else
besides himself is of that mind: at least wise, if he understand by faith, to
believe in the Saints, and not to believe them only: the one whereof is proper
to the Creator, the other to the creatures.

62. To the last I answer, that Prayer is properly one of the sacrifices of
the New Testament; for here the sacrifices are not corporal, but spiritual,
as may be proved in general by that which our Savior says, John 4. God
will be worshipped in Spirit, and truth. And in particular, by comparing Mal.
1. 11. with 1. Tim. 2. 8. for whereas Malachie prophesying Mal. 1. 11. 1. Tim.
2. 8.
of the Kingdom of Christ, had said that Incense, and a clean offering should
be offered to God in every place: Paul shows what is meant hereby, when he
commands to lift up pure hands unto God in every place. But suppose that it
were improperly called a sacrifice, yet it loses not the knot; for all kind
of sacrifices, both proper and improper, corporal and spiritual, are due
only unto God: for to whom belongs a Aug. de ciuit. li. 8 cap. vlt.
Temple and Altar, to him belongs a sacrifice, says Saint Augustine: but no
Temple or Altar, proper or improper, is to be built, or set up to any but to
God: and therefore no sacrifice is to be offered but to him.

63. Lastly, touching the authority of the Fathers, which are alleged so
frequently by Bellarmine, to prove the Invocation of Saints: and from which
Cassander would draw this conclusion, That it was not credible that those holy
men would admit any doctrine or custom, which they supposed to be contrary to
the Evangelical and Apostolical doctrine, or detract any thing from the glory
of God, or the merit of Christ, when as they underwent so heavy conflicts for
Christ's sake. Here, (not to keep the Reader in suspense, referring a fuller
satisfaction to this argument to a more fit place) four things are to be
noted; first, that for the space of two hundred years after Christ, the
Intercession and Invocation of Saints, were doctrines unknown unto the Church:
and therefore they allege no Father within that compass, save Dionisius
Areopagita: Dionis. Areopag. Eccles. Hier. c. 7.
Cap. 7. Eccles. Hierarch: which book, as diverse other that go under that
name, Illyricus has proved to be counterfeit by impregnable reasons. And
Iraeneus, Lib. 5. Iraeneus cont. haeres. lib. 5.
contra Haeres. who says, that the Virgin Mary was made the Advocate of the
Virgin Eve: by which he could not mean that Eve did pray unto Mary here on
earth, seeing Mary was Orig. in Epist. ad Romans lib. 2. and hom. 3. in Cant.
Nazian, de laud. Gorgon. and Orat. 1. cont. Julian. and Orat. de Basil. and
epitap. patris. Hier. Epist. ad Nepotian. Aug. de cur^ pro mort. cap. 16. and
13. and in Psalm. 108.
not then borne when Eve lived: nor that the Virgin Mary did pray for Eve
whilst she lived, because then she her self was not: both which must needs
be, if by this testimony the Invocation of Saints should be proved.

64. Secondly, those Fathers that lived in the next two hundred years, speak
of this matter very variously and doubtfully, as if it were a doctrine which
they knew not what to say to, and were not fully resolved in. Thirdly, of those
Fathers which he alleges, though in some places they seem to allow that
custom which was then brought into the Church: yet in other places they
disallow the same. Yea, and they are disapprooued also of others that lived in
the same age. Thus true Athanasius condemns Invocation of Saints, Orat. 2.
and 3. contra Arianos: and false Athanasius allows it, Sermon. in Euangel. de
Sanctissima Deipara. Basil approves it, but Nazianzene doubts of it, and
Epiphanius that lived also about that time, utterly condemns i^. Chrysostom
in some places seems to allow of it; in others, he speaks against it: and
so does Augustine, and the rest, as you may see at large proved by Chemnitius
in his examine of the Council of Chemnit. exam. de Inuoc. Sanct.
Trent. And that which is not to be forgotten, they allege many false and
counterfeit Books, under the name of the Fathers, as Dionysius Areopagita.
Ecclesiast. Hierar. Athanas. Sermon. de Sanctissima Deipara. Chrysostom. hom. ad
pop. 66. and many others of the like impression, as the same Chemnitius has
learnedly and unanswerably proved.

65. Lastly, those Fathers which do defend this Invocation, yet do not defend
it as it is now practiced in the Church of Rome: for first, the Fathers, if
they did allow of this Invocation, yet it was in their private devotions, not
in the public Leiturgie of the Church: for it cannot be proved, that in any
of the ancient Leiturgies this Invocation was used, until Gregory the firsts
time (for as for that which was called Chrysostomes Mass, all know it is a
bastard brat, and not a true Child of that good Father) but in the Church of
Rome it is practiced in their public service, and so is come from a matter of
private devotion, to a general practice of Religion. Secondly, the Fathers,
though they may seem to have prayed sometimes unto the Saints, out of the
heat of their devotion; yet it was but now and then, and as it were, by the
way, whereas their ordinary prayers and devotions were directed unto God: but
in the Church of Rome the Saints are more prayed unto, then God; he has the
least, and they the greatest share in their devotion; witness the Letanie of
the blessed Virgin Marie, and the Marie Psalter, and their Common practice.
Thirdly, the Fathers, albeit they directed their prayers sometimes to the
Saints, yet they reposed most confidence in their prayers to God, and in the
mediation of Christ, as appears by that which Chrysostom says; Ad Chrysostom.
hom. 12 in Math.
Deum non ostiar^o, etc. We need no Porter, nor Mediator, nor Minister, to
bring us to God: say but, Miserere mei Deus, etc. And in another place he
says, that when we pray our selves to Idem hom. de prof. Euang.
God, we obtain more, then when others pray for us. But the superstitious
Romanists think to speed better when they pray to the Saints, then when unto
God: And therefore they are not ashamed to say, that we must appeal from the
Court Bernardine in marial.
of Gods justice, to the Court of his Mothers mercy. Fourthly, the Fathers did
not so much as dream of any merits of supererogation which should be in the
Saints, and by them should be communicated vntovs: but all the interest and
benefit which we have to and in the merits of the Saints, in their judgment,
was, by virtue of the Communion of Saints: that as the members of one body
enjoy the strength and vigor that is in each other; so the members of Christ
militant, Aug. in Psalm. 130
receive a certain benefit from the gifts of God, bestowed Cassand. consult.
de Inuoc. Sanct.
upon the Saints triumphant, and do as it were merit by their merits, because
they are all members of one and the same mystical body. But the Romanists
hold, that the Saints do supererogate, that is, having more merits then they
need themselves, do confer some of their superabundance upon their poor
brethren that want. Fifthly, the Fathers, when they spoke of praying to the
Saints, did not speak positiuely, but tropically, and figuratively, by
hyperbolicall, and Rhetorical Apostophers, as may appear plainly in the
Orations of Nazianzen, and other of their writings: But the Romanists conclude
positiuely, and doctrinally, without any Rhetorical figures, or Hyperbolicall
elocutions. Sixthly, as Cassander confesses, when the Fathers said to the
Saints, Orate pronobis, they meant, Vtinam oretis pro nobis, Would to God they
would pray for us; and so they were rather wishes, then prayers: But the
Romanists admit no such extenuation, but flatly affirm, that we ought
directly to pray unto them as our Patrons, Protectors, and Intercessors. And
lastly, the Fathers relied not upon the intercession of Saints, except there
were in themselves a care and conscience of a godly life: but in Popery,
notorious, wicked, and ungodly persons, that never think upon amendment of
their lives, but persevere in their sins without repentance: yet do assure
themselves to be saved by the merits and intercession of the Saints. And thus,
howsoever they make a show of Fathers, to cloak their Idolatry withal; yet the
Fathers, if they be rightly understood, are as much different from them, as
black is from white. And the Fathers might be free from Idolatry, when as
they remain guilty.

66. The third and last way whereby they turn the blessed Saints into Idols,
is by putting their trust and confidence in their merits and mediation: which
kind of spiritual worship is due only unto the divine Majesty, as has been
showed. The truth of which assertion may be proved, first, by their doctrine,
and secondly, by the public practice of their Church. Touching their doctrine,
to omit the impious, impudent, and blasphemous opinions of their Monks and
Friars, who have egregiously exceeded the bounds of all piety in this point,
left the Romanists should say, that they were but private men's conceits, and
not the received doctrines of the Church; I will only relate some few
sentences out of their most public and athenticke writings.

67. And to begin with Peter Lumbard; he says, that the Lumbard lib. 4. did.
45.
Saints do intercede for us both by their merit, and by their affection:
therefore we pray unto them, that their merits may help us, and that they
would will our good; because, if they will it, God also will will it, and it
shall be done. Thus he makes Gods will to depend upon theirs, and not theirs
upon Gods; and consequently, more trust to be reposed in them, then in God.
Alexander Alensis, the most ancient of the Schoolmen, Alex. Alensis in 4.
Sentent. q. 92. me^b. 1. art. 4.
writes, that the Saints are to be prayed unto for three causes: First,
either for our poverty in meriting, that where our merits fail; others may
patronize us: or for our poverty in contemplation, that we not being able to
behold the highest light in it self, may behold the same in the Saints: or for
our poverty in loving, because the efficacy of prayer arises from devotion:
and for the most part, an imperfect man does feel himself more ^ffected
toward the Saints, then toward God. Secondly, for the glory of the Saints,
that whilst we obtain that which we desire by their suffrages, we may
magnify them. And thirdly, for the reverence of God, that a sinner that dares
not come unto him in his own person, may fly to the Saints, and implore their
helps. Bonauenture affirms, that the Saints by their merits have not
Bonauent. in 4. sentent. D. 45.
only deserved happiness and glory to themselves, but also by their merits of
supererogation, have power to help others that pray unto them. And again he
says, He that was before unworthy, by praying to the Saints is made worthy.
Aquinas gives this reason for praying to the Saints; Quia vltima reducuntur
Aquinas suple^* 3 part. qu. 72. art. 2.
in Deum per media: Because the extremes are reduced to God by the means,
therefore Gods benefits are conuayed unto us by the means of the Saints. Biel
says, that we ought Gab. Biel. super Canon.
to fly to the refuge of the Saints, that we may be saved by their merits and
prayers: and he says further, that God has given half his Kingdom to the
blessed Virgin, the Queen of heaven; as Assuerus promised to Queen Ester:
and so retayning justice to himself, he has granted mercy to her to be
exercised. And upon this ground, is that saying of Bernhardine, that we
Bernhardine in marial. Antonin. part. 4. tit. 15.
must appeal from the Court of Gods justice, to the Court of his Mothers
mercy. But Antoninus, the Archbishop of Florence is more plain then them all:
for he tells us, That it must needs be, that to whomsoever the blessed
Virgin turns her eyes, they must be justified and saved. And again, that
Christ is not only an Advocate, but a Judge: and therefore a sinner dares not
approach unto him; but that God has provided us of an Aduocatresse, which is
sweet and mild, and in whom is no bitterness. And again, Mary is that Throne
of grace, spoken of Heb. 4. 16. to whom we must approach with confidence, that
we Heb. 4. 16.
may obtain mercy, and find grace, in the time of need: Again, he calls
the Virgin Mary, the gate of heaven, because whatsoever grace ever came out of
heaven into the world, came out by her means: and whatsoever thing enters
into heaven, must enter by her: and so he calls the other Saints, Portas
coeli: The gates of heaven. Because by their prayers they carry us into Sotus
in confess. Cathol.
heaven. Sotus says, that the Saints are coadiutors, and cohelpers in the
work of our salvation. Many suchlike blasphemous Sotus in confess. Cathol.
sayings might be alleged out of their subtle Schoolmen, whereby it
evidently appears, that in those days the poor ignorant Romanists were
taught to repose the trust and confidence of their salvation, in the merits and
mediation of the Saints; yea, and that more then in Christ: as that public
Picture which was extant in many of their Churches does more fully prove: when
as Christ our Savior was painted like a stern man casting darts, and the
people flying for succor to the Virgin Mary, who interposed her self, and
showing her Son her breasts, received his darts in her garment. If this be
not, besides Idolatry, horrible and fearful blasphemy, let all men judge.

68. But what? is the doctrine of latter times any whit purer? no verily: for
the Council of Trent, that was called in pretense to this end, to reform
abuses in the Church, and to restore Religion to some purity, does approve
and confirm Council. Trident. Sess. 9.
all these gross opinions of the School Divines: for thus it decrees; that
it is good and profitable, humbly to invoke the Saints, and to fly to their
prayers and succor for the obtaining of blessing from God in Christ. And that
we may see the meaning of this Decree, the Roman Catechism, which Catechis.
Roman.
was made by the commandment of the Bishop of Rome, does more expressly
affirm, that the Saints are therefore to be called upon, because they pray
continually for the salvation of men: and God bestows many benefits upon us
for their merit and grace sake: and that they obtain pardon for our sins,
and reconcile us into the favor of God. And for the refining Jesuits, they
have not yet refined this error: for, Coster writes, Coster Enchir.
that the Saints are to be inuocated, both that they may mediate our cause to
God, and also, that themselves may help us. Viega, another Jesuit, says,
that they are as it were the doors, Viega in Apocal.
by which an entrance is opened to us unto the most holy places in heaven.
Osorius, another of the same stamp, affirms, that Osorius ^om. 3. co^ci^^.
pa. 6^1.
God gives us all good things by the intercession of the Saints. And lastly,
to make up the mess, Bellarmine himself, that is Bell. de Sanctor. bent. li.
1. ca. 20.
more wary then all the rest, does not blush to say, that Gods predestination
is helped and supported by the prayers of the Saints, Bell. de Sanctor. beat.
l. 1. c. 20.
because God has determined to use their prayers for the effecting of man's
salvation. Behold here a Map of the Romish doctrine. Who can now choose but
account them Idolaters, when they thus teach the people, That all blessings
descend upon them by the means of the Saints; and so encourage them to repose
their confidence in their merits?

69. But from their doctrine, let us come to the practice of their Church, and
we shall see this more clearly: and here some few examples shall serve for a
taste; for to propound all in this kind, would be both tedious and needless.
Thus therefore in their public Service Books, Rosaries, and Breuiaries, they
pray unto the Saints:

To Saint Paul.

Vouchsafe to bring thy humble suppliants to heaven after the end of this life,
to whom thou have revealed the light of truth. To Saint James the greater.

Hail, o singular safeguard of thy pilgrims, bountifully hear the prayers of
thy servants, help them that worship thee, and bring them to heaven. To Saint
Thomas thus:

Vouchsafe to establish us, thy suppliants, in his faith, by handling of who^,
thou deseruedst to acknowledge to be God. To Saint John.

Hail, o holy Apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ, I entreat thee by his love who
chose thee out of the world, that thou would deliver me, thy unworthy
servant, from all adversity, and from all impediments of body and soul, and
receiving my soul at the hour of death, would bring me to life
everlasting. To Saint George thus:

He save us from our sins, that we may rest with the blessed in heaven.
Here Saint George is made a Savior, and that from sin: and so either Christ
is clear put out of his office, or George joined with him in his office.

Again, to Saint Erasmus.

Grant, that by thy merits and prayers, we may overcome all the snares of our
enemies, and be freed from the poverty of body and mind, and from eternal
death. To Saint Christopher.

O glorious Martyr, Christopher, be mindful of us to God, and without delay,
defend our body, sense and honor, thou that deseruedst to carry in thine arms
over the Sea, the Flower of heaven, cause us to avoid all wickedness, and to
love God with all our hearts. To Saint Cosmus and Damianus.

O most holy Physicians, who shine in heaven most clearly by your merits,
preserve us both from bodily plague and disease* and also from the death of the
soul, that we may live in grace, until we enter into heaven. To Francis the
Friar, thus:

O Francis, suns light, singular crucified Saint, etc. be^ thou to us the way
of life, make satisfaction for us always, show to Christ the marks of thy
wounds. This Friar Francis they make equal to Christ: and therefore Posseuine
bibl. select. page 295. ^oz de sig. eccles. tom. 2. page 200.
they say, that Christ imprinted his five wounds upon him, as if he also were
to suffer for the world, and redeem mankind, and that they were alike in all
things: as those blasphemous Verses of two shameless Jesuits, Turselline and
Bencius do Exue Francisc^ ^unica laceraque cu^ullo: qui Franciscus erat, iam
tibi Christus crit.
declare.

70. What should I trouble thee (gentle Reader) with any more of this trumpery?
their Books are full of suchlike prayers, if any please to read them: and
that we may plainly see, that they put their trust and confidence in them, not
only the words do sufficiently signify, but also the liberal Francisci
exuvijs (si qua lice^) indue Christum* iam Franciscus crit, qui modo Christus
erat.
indulgences their Popes have annexed to the devout sayings of such Orisons: As
Pope Sixtus has promised eleven thousand years pardon to them that shall say
a certain prayer before the Image of the Virgin Mary, beginning thus; Aue
sancta Matter Dei, etc. But to leave the rest of the Saints, and to come to the
blessed Virgin, whom with Epiphanius, we bless and honor, but in ^^ cas^
worship: it is a Epiphan. lib. 3.
wonder into what an abominable Idol they have translated, not her (for she
abhorres their impiety,) but the Idea and fancy of her, which they have
devised in their own brains: for they call her the Queen of heaven, the
Mother of mercy, the Gate of Paradise, the Life and hope of a sinner, the Light
of the Church, the Lady of the world, the Aduocatresse and Mediatrix of
mankind: yea, they say, that the death Bernhardinmariale.
and passion of Christ and the holy Virgin, was for the redemption of
mankind; and that she also must come betwixt God and us for the remission of
sin; and that her Son Pet. Galatin. de arcan cathol. verit. page 515.
and she redeemed the world with one heart: as Adam and Eve sold the world for
one apple. And thus they join the Virgin Mary with Christ in the office of
our redemption, and so make her equal with him, which were somewhat tolerable,
if they could stay there, but they climb higher in impudency, and not only
match her with Christ, but set her above him: For they tell us of a vision, How
Christ preparing to judge the world, there were two Ladders set, that reached
to heaven: the one red, at the top whereof Christ sat; the Spec. exempl. d. 7.
11. 4.
other white, at the top whereof the Virgin Mary sat: and when the Friars
could not get up by the red Ladder of Christ, but evermore fell down, Saint
Francis called them to the white Ladder of our Lady, and there they were
received. And a late Jesuit has set forth to the view of the world certain
Carolus Scriban. alias, clarus Benarscius.
Verses, wherein he preferres the milk of our Lady, in many respects, before
the blood of Christ: yea, they subject Christ, now reigning in the heavens, to
his Mothers command: as it is sung in some of their Churches: Gab. Bi^l lect.
80. in Canon miss^. Cassand. consult. page 155.


O happy Virgin, that our sins do purge,
E^treate thy Mother, and thy Son do urge;
Command him, though Redeemer that ^e be,
By right of Motherhood, which is given to thee.
71. And this the Rosarie of the Virgin Mary does more evidently manifest: for
Dominicke, who was the first inuentor of it, ordained that fifty Ane Mary's
should be recited, and at every tenth, one Pater noster, which together make a
Rosarie: and for this purpose the same Dominicke framed five and fifty Stones
or Beads, and hung them together on a string, betwixt every ten little ones,
one great one, and called them Patriloquia, as it were prayers to the Father;
which he might more properly have called, Matriloquia, prayers to the Mother:
for here are ten Aues, to each Pater noster. And this was the original of
praying upon Beads. Now out of these Rosaries, sprung there Mary Psalters: for
three Rosaries, to wit, an hundred and fifty Aue Mary's, and fifteen Pater
nosters, make one Mary Psalter, because, forsooth, the Psalter of David
consists of so many Psalms: and to the fraternity of this Psalter, and the
sayers thereof, were given by diverse Popes, as Sixtus the fourth, and Innocent
the eighth, threescore thousand years of indulgence, and plenary remission
both from the punishment and fault, one, in the time of life, and one in the
hour of death. Is not here, I pray you, the worship of the Virgin Mary
exalted above the worship of Christ? who can doubt of it, seeing the proportion
is ten to one, fifty to five, an hundred to ten, an hundred and fifty to
fifteen? And no marvel, if it be thus in their prayers, seeing it is as
evil or worse in their deeds: for whereas we have one Church, or religious
house, dedicated to Christ, we shall find ten dedicated to Mary the Mother of
Christ: and so the Mother is advanced above the Son, and yet she but a woman
of flesh and blood, saved by her Son, and blessed by that faith which she
had in him, and he the Son of God, as well as the Son of Man, the Savior
and Redeemer of mankind.

72. But the most horrible Idolatry and blasphemy of all the rest, is to be
found in another Mary Psalter of theirs, compiled (as they say) by Bonauenture,
and authorized in the Cassand. consult. page 155.
Church of Rome: wherein they apply all the whole Psalter of David, to the
Virgin Mary; and wheresoever they find the name, Dominus, Lord, they put in,
Domina, Lady: as for example, in the third Psalm, for, Lord, how are my foes
increast; they say, Lady, how are my foes increast! and in the sixth Psalm,
for, O Lord, correct me not in thy wrath; they say, O Lady, correct me not in
thy wrath. And in the 31. Psalm, for, Blessed are they, O Lord, whose sins
are forgiven; they say, Blessed are they whose hearts love thee, O Virgin
Mary; for their sins shall be forgiven them by thee: and so clean through
the Psalter. If any desire to see the gulf and dunghill of Superstition and
Idolatry, practiced in the Church of Rome, under the Invocation of Saints, let
him but read this one Psalter, which alone, if there were no other argument, is
sufficient to convince their whole Church of open and notorious Idolatry: and
that, Cassander himself confesses in the place above quoted.

73. Thus they exalt the Virgin Mary above Christ, and equal her with God:
yea, which is horrible to speak, and fearful to be recorded, they place her
above God himself: for they teach, that a man may appeal to the Virgin Mary,
not only from a Tyrant, and from the Devil; but even from God himself. This
writes Bernardine de Busto, about 120. Bernardine de Busto. marial. p. 3. ser.
3. pa. 96 Posseuine in Appar. sacr. Pet. Mathaeus com. sub constit. Pii. 2.
page 20.
years since, and his book was authorized by Pope Alexander the sixth, and yet
remains so far from all disallowance, that it is approved by Posseuine, as
a learned and godly book. Out of which it must needs follow (which I tremble
to utter) that by their doctrine, the Virgin Mary is greater then God; because
every appeal is from the lesser to the greater.

74. But no marvel, if they prefer Mary to Christ, that is, the Mother
before the Son, seeing they do as much to two Friars, Francis and Dominicke.
He that would see how Francis is matched and exalted above Christ, let him read
the book of his Conformities, and he will be astonished at their madness.
Also, of Dominicke they write most strange things, and such, as Christ never
did the like: as for example; Christ raised but three dead (says Antoninus:)
but Dominicke Antonin. part. 3. tit. 23. c. 1. ^. 3.
raised three at Rome, and forty that were drowned in a River near to
Tholosse. Christ being made immortal after his resurrection, entered twice into
the house, the doors being shut: but Dominicke, being a mortal man, entered
into a Church in the night, the doors being shut, that he might not waken the
brethren. Christ had all power committed unto him in heaven and earth: and
Dominicke did partake the same power with him; for the Angels served him, the
Elements obeyed him, and the Devils trembled at him. Christ was the Lord
absolutely, and by authority: but Dominicke principally, and by possession.
Christ was laid at his birth in a Manger, and wrapped in clouts to keep him
from cold: but Dominicke being an infant, would often get out of his bed, and
as if he abhorred all delights of the flesh, lie upon the bare ground. Christ
never prayed, but he was heard, if he would; except in the Garden, when he
prayed that the Cup might pass away from him, where praying according to his
sensual part, would not be heard according to reason: but Dominicke never
desired any thing of God, but it was granted unto him. Christ being borne, a
Star appeared in the East, which directed the Wisemen to him, and foreshewed
that he should be the light of the world: but Dominicke being borne, and ready
to be baptized, his Godmother saw a Star in his forehead, foretelling a new
light of the world. Lastly, Christ loved us, and washed away our sins by his
blood: so did Dominicke; for he whipped himself thrice every day with an Iron
chain, and drew blood each time out of his sides: once for his own sins,
which were very small; the second for those that were in Purgatory; and the
third for those that live in the world. Is not Dominicke here in some things
equalled, and in others preferred before our blessed Savior, Jesus Christ?

75. And thus to pass over all their false and counterfeit Saints, which
either never were in rerum natura, or were not such as they make them: as
Christopher, George, Catherine, Bell. de beat. Sanct. lib. 1. ca. 9.
and such like. For it is a true saying of Augustine, or of some other;
Multorum corpora honorantur in terris, quorum animae torquentur in inferno: The
bodies of many are honored on earth, whose souls are tormented in hell. And
to omit Caict. tract. de concept. and Indulg. Bell. de eccles. triump. l. 1. c.
9.
that the Pope may err in the canonizing of Saints, it being grounded upon
false miracles: as Caietane acknowledges, and others; though Bellarmine be of
another mind, and labors to prove the contrary: but (God wot) with very
shallow reasons, as any may discern that will but read him. To omit (I say)
all this, by that which has been said it is most clear, that under the
doctrine and practice of Invocation of Saints in the Church of Rome, lies
lurking most abominable Idolatry.

76. The last principal branch of Idolatry, maintained and practiced in the
Church of Rome, is the adoration and worshipping of the Cross. Now by the
Cross they understand, either the true Cross of Christ, together with any
part or portion thereof; or the picture or image of that Cross, whether it be
material and permanent, or transeunt and formal only. Of both which this is
the doctrine of the Church of Rome: that not only that Cross whereon Christ
dyed, but every picture and representation of it, whether graven or paynted^,
or expressed in the air, with the hand and fingers, is to be kissed and
adored. This is the position Vasques de Adora. l. 3. c. 2. Bell. de Imag. l. 3.
c. 27. 28. 29.
of Vasques the Jesuit; and he says, that it is the doctrine and faith of
the Roman Church. And the same is avouched by Bellarmine, and confirmed by
many arguments (weak ones, God wot) in three whole Chapters: wherein he
labors to prove; first, that the Cross it self: secondly, that the Image
of the Cross: and thirdly, that the sign of the Cross, are all to be
worshipped: and with what kind of worship? Aquinas resolves us in that point,
when he affirms, Aquin. Sum. part. 3. art. 4.
that the very Cross of Christ, whereon he was crucified, is to be worshipped
with divine worship: for two causes; both for the representation or resemblance
it has to Christ; as also, for that it touched the body of Christ: but the
sign of the Cross or Crucifix, is to be worshipped with latria, only in the
former respect. And this is still the doctrine of their Church: for neither is
it taxed in their late editions for error, nor contradicted by any other
Romish Doctor. Yea, a Chrysostom. a visitat. de verb. domini, tom. 4 l. 6. c. 7
late famous Papist, and a professor of Divinity, does plainly confirm the
fame: dedicating his book to Pope Clement the eighth, for he says in plain
words, that they worship the Cross with the same worship wherewith they adore
Christ him* self: and that they pray unto the Cross, as unto him that was
crucified on it, and repose the hope of their salvation upon it.

77. And this is the doctrine of the Romish Synagogue at this day; and their
practice is correspondent thereunto: for they kneel unto the Cross, they
kiss it, they creep unto it, they pray unto it; yea, they repose the hope of
their salvation in it: as appears in that form of prayer used in their Mass
book:

All hail, o Cross, our only hope; in this time of Lent, do thou increase
righteousness in good men, and grant pardon to sinners. Now that this is
heathenish Idolatry, may appear by these reasons: First, because outward
religious adoration is given to a piece of wood, or brass, or gold, or some
other matter. Aug. in Faust. lib. 15.
Secondly, because divine worship, even latria, which Augustine says, is
proper only unto God, is given to a creature: for such is the Cross, at the
best. Thirdly, because they pray unto it, as unto a living thing. Fourthly,
because they repose the hope of their salvation in it. And lastly, because
many, if not all of these Relics, which are believed to be fragments of
Christ's Cross, are false and counterfeit; as has been showed already. In all
these respects the Cross is made an Idol, and the worshippers of it are no
better then Idolaters.

78. Ob. I, but the Cross touched Christ, and therefore it is to be
worshipped with divine worship. R. So did the Manger wherein he lay, being an
infant; and the Grave wherein he was laid, being dead; and the Pillar whereunto
he leaned, being whipped; and the Ass where on he rode, being in his journey
to the City: yea, so did the womb of the blessed Virgin his Mother, before
he was borne: and yet they will not say that any of these are to be
worshipped with latria. I am sure the Apostles cannot be found to have given
any manner of religious worship to any of these things, much less divine
worship: though I deny not, but that the true Relics of Christ, and those
things that any ways pertayned unto him, were reverenced without doubt by his
friends after his departure: and so far we also willingly condescend unto
them; but that any religious worship was given unto the^ they can never prove.
Ob. I, but the Cross was the Bell. de Imag. lib. 2. cap. 27.
instrument of Christ's passion, and Man's redemption, and the Altar of that
great Sacrifice, and the Ladder by which Christ ascended into heaven; therefore
it is to be worshipped. R. So was Judas an instrument of Christ's passion, and
our redemption: as Saint Augustine teaches, when he says, that Aug. in Psalm.
34.
Judas was elected by Christ, to the end, that by him he might fulfill our
redemption; and so was Pilate and Caiphas: yet these are not therefore to be
worshipped, unless we will revive the old heresy of the Cai^nians and the
Marrionites. And so Aug. de baeres. cap. 18. Iraen. li. 1. ca. 29.
was the Spear that let out his heart blood, which was the price of our
redemption; and yet they themselves do not give divine worship unto it for
that cause, albeit they make an Idol of it, as has been declared. Ob. I, but
many Bell. de Imag. lib. 2. cap. 27.
mysteries are signified by the Cross: as first, Christian perfection, in the
longitude, latitude, height, and profunditie of it: the profundity signifying
faith; the height, hope; the latitude, charity; and the longitude,
perseverance. Secondly, the effect of Christ's passion: the highest piece of
wood signifying, that heaven was opened, and God pacified: the lowest, that was
fastened in the ground, that bell was emptied, and the Devil conquered: the
overthwart piece, that the whole world was redeemed, etc. Thirdly, the uniting
of Jews and Gentiles: the two arms of the Crosses under one title,
representing the union of two people under one head. These, and diverse other
mysteries are hidden under the Cross, therefore it is to be worshipped with
divine worship. R. Suppose that all these mysteries were there to be conceived;
yet to say, that therefore it is to be worshipped, is a silly reason, and
scarce befitting the learning of Bellarmine: for by the same argument, all
their Sacraments, and many other things, should be worshipped with divine
worship. Ob. I, but the Cross was miraculously found out by Helena: and that
not before Constantines time, when it might safely be worshipped; and it was
revealed to be the true Cross, by evident miracles: therefore it is to be
worshipped with divine worship. R. Grant all this to be true, which
notwithstanding may probably be questioned: yet that this does not prove that
the Cross is to be worshipped, Helenes own example does show: for as
Ambrose writes, She worshipped Ambros de obitu Theodos.
not the wood of the Cross, but him that hung upon the wood, because this
(says he) is a heathenish error, etc. neither can they ever prove that it
was therefore revealed, that it might be worshipped.

79. Did ever any man read more pitiful arguments? the rest which ^ee uses
are all of the same stamp. Ob. I, but a Crucifix is like unto Christ, says
he, therefore it i^to be Bell. ibid.
worshipped with latria. R. But the Virgin his Mother was more like to him, and
yet they give not unto her so high a worship. Ob. I, but the Fathers held the
Cross in great reverence, and the Image of the Cross, and worshipped them. R.
True, they reverenced them, and held them in great estimation: but yet there
was no worship given unto them, until near 400. years after Christ. About
that time began this superstition: for in Saint Ambrose time it was not crept
in, as appears by that testimony before alleged: not in Arnobius time, who
plainly affirms, that they did Arnob. lib. 8.
not worship Crosses. Again, those Fathers that did adore them, did not
worship the Cross or the Crucifix, but him that hung upon the Cross; as may
appear by Hieroms testimony Hierom in epit. Paulae.
concerning Paulae, who says, that she falling prostrate before the Cross,
worshipped as if she had seen the Lord there hanging before her: by which it
is plain, that she worshipped not the Cross, but the Lord. And Ambrose also
witnesses Ambros. de obitu Theodos.
the same, when he calls it an heathenish error, and the vanity of
wickedmen to worship the Cross. But the Romanists teach, that the Cross it
self, and the Crucifix are to be worshipped, and that with the highest
worship. Ob. I, but many and strange miracles have been wrought by the sign
of the Cross; therefore it is to be worshipped. R. The argument is naught:
for if every worker of miracles should be worshipped with divine adoration,
then all the Apostles might challenge this honor unto them. So might Iannes
and Iambres that resisted Moses. Yea, so might Antichrist himself: for his
coming is with lying signs and wonders: lying, not only in respect of their
substance, which is sometimes counterfeit: but also in respect of the end,
which is to seduce, when the miracle for substance may be true: and this is
both Saint Chrystostomes and Saint Augustines exposition Chrysostom. in 2. these.
2. Aug. de ciuit. lib. 20. c. 19.
of that place: besides, the miracles that were done at or before this sign,
were effected by the power of the faith and invocation of Christ crucified; and
not by the bare sign of the Cross, as most of the Fathers confess, and all
of Aug. ser. 19. de* ^and. Cyril. catechis. 13. Nazian. ad Nemes. Orig. cont.
Cells. Eusebius. hist. l. 8. c. 7.
them do secretly insinuate. And therefore the signing of themselves with the
Cross, was a secret kind of invocation of Christ crucified; as Bellarmine
himself acknowledges. And thus it follows, that those miracles which they
talk of: as the driving away of Devils, and ouercomming mortal enemies, and
such like, are not to be ascribed to the sign of the Cross, but to
invocation, and prayer, and faith in Christ crucified.

80. Ob. I, but the Apostle Paul says, God forbid that I Gal, 6. 14.
should rejoice in any thing, but inthe Cross of our Lord Jesus Gal. 2. 14.
Christ: and, He took the handwriting that was against us, and Gal. 2. 20.
nailed it on his Cross: and, he set all things at peace through the blood of
his Cross, etc. therefore it is to be worshipped. R. The consequent of this
arguments as good as the former; for how can it follow, that because the Cross
was the instrument of our redemption, therefore it should be adored? The
weakness of this sequel is before discovered. Besides, by the Cross is
understood most commonly in the Scripture, either the whole work of Christ's
passion, or afflictions and persecutions for Christ's sake; neither of which,
especially the latter, are to be adored with divine adoration. In a word, there
is nothing they can allege, that does carry with it any show of sound reason,
to hide the shame of their Church in this open Idolatry, and yet they labor
tooth and nail for it; but they profit but a little.

81. We confess that there was a holy and commendable use of the transcant
sign of the Cross in the primitive Church: to wit, as a badge of Christian
profession, to signify that they were not ashamed of their crucified God,
which the heathen and wicked Jews used to cast in their teeth: and so of the
permanent Cross erected in public places, to be as it were a trophee and
monument of the exaltation of him that dyed on the Cross. But now Popery has
turned this laudable use of the Cross into Paganish abomination; and has
given to it that honor which belonged to him that dyed upon the Cross: and
therefore we most justly accuse them of fou^e Idolatry, and find them guilty
without all controversy, and that not only in th^s last enditement, touching
the Cross, but also in the four former heads. And therefore the conclusion is
by necessary consequence most firm and true, that seeing the Church of Rome is
thus many ways guilty of Idolatry, therefore it is to be abandoned and
forsaken, and that religion which maintayneth this impiety, worthily to be
abhorred.

MOTIVE. VIII. That Religion which implies manifold contradiction in it self,
and is contrary to it self in many things, cannot be the true Religion: but
such is the Religion of the Church of Rome: ergo, etc.
1. IT is an old saying and true, Oportet mendacem esse memorem: It behooves a
liar to have a good memory, lest he cross himself in his tale, and so
discover his falsehood. This saying is verified in our Adversaries the
Romanists, whose Religion, being nothing else but a bundle of lies, and a
hotch-potch of old heresies, crosses it self in many substantial points,
and thereby reuealeth the manifold errors and falsities that lurk in the
bosom thereof. That this is true, the discourse ensuing thereof (I hope) shall
make so manifest, that they themselves shall not be able to gainfay it.

2. The Mayor proposition in this argument is of such evident MAYOR.
verity, that by no show of reason it can possibly be contradicted; considering
that truth is always, and in every part, like to it self, and agreeing,
consenting, and conspiring with it self, as a perfect body, wherein there is
such a sweet harmony of all the members. that one is not contrary to another,
but all tend to one and the same end, and unite their forces together, for the
good of the whole: for which cause the Orator defines truth to be that which
is simple and Cic. offic. lib. 1. Terent. Bernard. in ser.
sincere. And the Poet says, that it seeks no corners. To which Saint
Bernard alluding, thus writes, Non amat veritas angulos, non ei diuersoria
placent, in medio stat, etc. i. It loves no corners, by-ways do not please
it, it stands in the miast. And therefore the Ancients in their
Hierogliphicks represented truth by the picture of the Sun, not only in
Pierius valor. Hieroglyph. l. 44. page 430.
respect of the purity and clarity of it; but also in respect of the
simplicity and unity. Duplicia enim and multiplicia sunt veritati contraria;
( i) Duplicity and multiplicity, are contrary to verity. But falsity, error,
and lying, is full of doubtings, windings, and contrarieties, like a dream in
the night, the end whereof, for the most part is never agreeable to the
beginning. And this is that which the Philosopher teaches, Aristotle.
when he says, that Mendacium de seipso duplex est; A lie is double of it
self. And as Chrysostom notes, Mendacia si Cprysost. super Mato. 21.
non habent quem deciptant, ipsa sibi mentiuntur; Lies, if they have not one to
deceive, they deceive and beguile themselves. So that it must needs follow,
that that Religion which infoldeth in it self contradictions, and
contrarieties, cannot be the truth, but must of necessity be lying and
erroneous.

3. I therefore leave the Mayor thus cleared, and come to MINOR.
the proof of the Minor, or second proposition, which is, that the Religion of
the Church of Rome is replenished with many contradictions, and is at variance
and discord in it self, and therefore cannot stand: as our Savior concludes
of an Mat. 12.
house or a kingdom. And to show this to be true, let us first begin with the
Sacrament: in the doctrine whereof are enwrapped many absurd contradictions; as
for example.

4. It is a ground and principle of their Religion, and of 1. Contrad.
ours, and of the truth, that Christ our Savior took verily and truly, flesh
of the Virgin Mary, and had a true humane body, like to us in all things,
sin only excepted: and therefore that this body of his had all the
demensions and circumscriptions of a body, and all the properties and qualities
naturally belonging thereunto. This ground of truth the Church of God has ever
defended against all Heretics of former and latter times, that impugned the
same: to wit, the Marionites, the Manichees, and the Eutychians, with diverse
others, that thought, and taught erroniously concerning the humanity of Christ:
affirming that he had no true, but a fantastical body. Now this error is in
outward appearance condemned by the Church of Rome, and adjudged as a damnable
heresy. But if we look into other of their doctrines, and necessary
consequences that may be derived therefrom, we shall fi^de, that they cross
their own positions, and hold in substance as much as the old Heretics did.

5. For in their doctrine of the Sacrament they teach, that Christ gave his
own natural body with his own hands to Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 19.
Coster Enchirid.
his Apostles, when he said, This is my body: by which it must needs follow,
that he both kept his body to himself, sitting at the Table, and also gave it
to his Apostles: so that at this first Supper there were thirteen bodies of
Christ; for every one (by their doctrine) had the true natural body of Christ
wholly communicated unto him. Now how is Christ's body here a true natural
body, being in thirteen places at once? From hence thus I reason: A true
natural body is circumscribed, and can be but in one place at once: but by the
Popish doctrine of transsubstantiation, Christ's body was in diverse places at
once; therefore it was no true natural body. And so the doctrine of
Transubstantiation do^th contradict and overthrow the doctrine of the truth of
Christ's humane nature: and that, not only after it was glorified, whereof,
peradventure, there might be some better show of reason, but even whilst it was
here upon the earth, subject to all humane sinlesse infirmities, yea, to death
it self. And this conclusion is not ours, but S. Augustines: that is, Take
away Aug. Epist. ^7. ad Dardan.
from bodies (says he) space of place, and they will be no where, and because
they will be no where, therefore they will not be at all. And again, in the
same Epistle he says, speaking of Christ, that ^ We must take heed that we do
not so build up the Divinity of Christ a man, that we take away the truth of
his body. But the Romanists destroy the truth of Christ's humanity, by giving
unto it an essential being and subsisting in many distant places at once; and
make it no body in truth, by denying unto it a certain circumscription of one
singular place at one time, which ^s a necessary acc^slarie to all quantitiue
bodies.

6. Bellarmine, to salve this contradiction, labors mainely, Bell. de Euchar.
lib. 3. c. 4. 5.
stretching all the strings of his wit to the highest strain, even till they
crack again: but all his labor is not worth a rush: every child may say
that he does but tryfle; for first, he says that Christ's body is but in one
place locally, but in many places sacramental^y. Secondly, that it is in the
consecrated host, definitive, and not circumscriptiue; definitely, and not
circumscriptiuely. Thirdly, (not satisfying himself with this evasion neither)
he says, that it is in the Sacrament, Tanquam Deus est in loco, As God is in a
place: that is, by a supernatural presence only. Lastly, he flies to Gods
omnipotency, and disclayming all natural respect, says, it is a miracle: so
that (in truth) he knows not what to say, one part of his speech thwarting
and crossing another.

7. For if the body of Christ be in the Sacrament, sacramentally only, then
it is not, either definitely, as Angels and Spirits are said to be, or
divinely, as God is: for, sacramentally to be in a place, is to be there by
way of relation, and not by corporal existence, as all know; and so we say,
that Christ's body is there present. Again, if it be definitiuely, then it
cannot be a substantial body, subsisting of parts, and members, and quantity,
as they say Christ's body does in the Sacrament: because it is proper to
Spirits, and intellectual essences, to be in a place after that manner, and
not to bodies; Aquin. p. 1. q. 52. art. 2.
as their learned Aquinas tells us: and if it be there after the manner of
Gods presence, then it cannot be there after the manner of a body; unless
with the Anthropomorphites, he will impiously ascribe a body unto God. And
lastly, touching Gods omnipotency, and the miracle arising therefrom,
Bellarmine himself acknowledges, that God cannot Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3.
cap. 2.
do that which does imply contradiction; for that is to be unlike to
himself, and to deny himself: but these things are contradictories, a body
with quantity, that is, with just length, breadth, proportion, sitting at the
Table, and at the same time, the same body without length, breadth, or
proportion, hidden in the bread; a body visible, and yet the same invisible at
the same instant: a body with position and situation of parts, and yet the same
without position and situation of parts, included in every cr^mme of the host.
Yea, lastly, one body sitting at the Table with his Apostles, speaking,
breathing, spreading his hands, and full of infirmity: the other in the
stomachs of his Disciples, neither speaking, nor breathing, nor stirring, no^
subject to infirmity. Now compare the terms together: Sitting, and not
sitting: visible, and invisible: with situation, and without situation: one,
and not one, and all at the same instant and moment of time, are gross
contradictions, which, as Bellarmine confesses, Almighty God himself cannot
reconcile, who by his omnipotent power is able to do all things: but this is
nothing, and therefore is rather to be accounted a defect of impotency then an
effect of omnipotency: Dicitur enim Deus Aug. de ciuit. lib. 5. cap. 10.
omnipotens faciendo quod vult, non patiendo quod non vult. i. For God is said
to be omnipotent, by doing that which he will, not by suffering that which he
will not.

8. From hence it must needs follow, that here can be no miracle; and that
not only because miracles are extraordinary works of God; and this change of
substances is ordinary in every Sacrament, as they say: and miracles are not
contrary, but above or beside nature; but this is flat contrary, not only to
nature, but to God himself, the Author and Creator of nature: and miracles
are always sensible, but this is insensible, and cannot be discerned by any
outward means: but also for that no miracle can imply contradiction in it
self, as this must needs do, if it were as they would have it. For when
Aarons Rod was turned into a Serpent, it left to be a Rod; and when it
turned into a Rod, it left to be a Serpent. And when the Water was turned
into Wine, it left to be Water, it was impossible that it should have been
both Water and Wine at one time, in one and the same respect; or a Rod and a
Serpent at once. And so of all other miracles, there is not one to be found
that enwrappeth Aug. detrinit. cap. 10.
contradictions. Besides all which, Saint Augustine concludes peremptorily,
that Sacraments may have honor, vt Religiosa: but not amazement vt admiranda,
as miracles. And Thomas Aquinas more plainly says, Ea quae contradictionem
Aquin. p. 1. q. 25. art. 3.
implioant, sub diuina potentia non continentur. i. Those things which imply
contradiction, cannot fall under the power of God.

9. They reply, that they teach no more then Cyprian did, thirteeene hundred
years since, who said that Christ did Cyprian. ser. de coena dom.
bear himself in his own hands at the last Supper. I answer, that Cyprian
in that place, and the rest of the Fathers elsewhere, did often use
hyperbolicall speeches, to extol the dignity of the Sacrament, and to show the
certainty and efficacy of our communion with Christ, and of our spiritual
eating of him: but they never meant so as the Romanists do; that Christ bore
his real, natural, substantial body in his own hands, and gave it to his
Apostles after a fleshly manner. For Cyprian Cyprian. epist. 202. ad Euodiu^.
expounds himself in another place, when he says, that Sacraments have the
names of those things which they signify. And Saint Augustine more plainly
says, that Christ did bear himself in his own hands after a sort. If it had
been really, and substantially, what need he have added, after a sort? for
this word, as they use to speak in Schools, is, Terminus diminutiuus, qui
realitati vbique detrahit. A diminitiue term, which detracteth from the
realtie and true being of a thing. And this speech, Christ bore himself in his
own hands after a sort, is all one with that in another place, After a
certain manner the Sacrament of Christ's body, is Christ's body. So that it is
plain, that when the Fathers said, Christ bore himself in his own hands,
they meant nothing, but that he bore in his hands the Sacrament of himself:
and thus this first contradiction is irreconciliable. I come to a second, and
that in the Sacrament, which is no less palpable.

10. It is a principle of their Religion, and of the truth 2. Contrad.
it self, that Christ after his resurrection ascended into heaven, and there
fills a place, and has figure, form, and disposition of parts, and is
circumscribed within a certain compass, according to the nature of a body.
This is Bellarmines Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 7.
own assertion, and it is consonant to sound doctrine, confirmed both by
manifest Scripture, and uniform consent of ancient Fathers: for Scripture,
Christ is said to be like unto us; and not barely like, but like in all
things, that is, both in nature, and in the qualities and quantities of nature.
And to put the matter out of doubt, only one thing is excepted Phil. 2. 7.
Heb. 2. 17. Heb. 4. 25.
wherein he is not like unto us, and that is Sin, whereby he is absolutely
left to be like unto us in all other things. And lest any should think, that
that was true only whilst he was here upon earth, the Apostle in the forenamed
places applies it to him being in heaven: for he says, We have not an
High Priest which cannot be touched with our infirmities, and therefore let us
boldly go unto the throne of grace: where the Apostles argument were of no
force, if he were like unto us here on earth, only in the state of his
humility, and not also now, being in heaven, in the state of glory: for
sinful man might thus reply, True, Christ was like our nature whilst he lived
amongst us; but now, being glorified, he has put off our nature, and therefore
we dare not presume to come unto him. Yes, says the Apostle, he is still like
unto us, and has not put off our nature, but the infirmities of our nature
only, which were the sequels of sin, as we also shall do when we shall be
translated into heaven after the resurrection. And this Saint Luke more
plainly avouches, when he says, that after he had blessed them, he departed
from them, and Luke 24. 5.
was carried up into heaven: and that whilst they beheld, he was taken up by a
cloud out of their sight. Where we see plainly Act. 1. 9.
a local motion of Christ from earth to heaven: and therefore there must needs
be of him a local situation in the heavens. As also Saint Peter in express
words does affirm, when he says, that the heavens must contain or receive
him, Act. 3. 21.
until the time of restoration of all things. Thus this doctrine is consonant
to holy Scripture.

11. Now let us see how it was entertained by the ancient Fathers: thus they
write. Athanasius: When Christ said, I Athanas. in disput. contra Arrian.
go to the Father, he spoke of the humane nature which he haed assumed: for
it is the property of him to go and come, who is circumscribed with certain
limits of places; and forsaking that place where it was, comes to the place
where it was not. Nazianzene Nazianz. ad Cledonium.
says, We profess one and the same Lord, passible in the flesh, impossible
in his Godhead; circumscribed in body, uncircumcised in deity; the same both
earthly and heavenly, visible, and invisible; comprehended in place, and not
comprehended. Ibid.
Again, Christ as man is circumscribed, and contained in place; Christ as God
is uncircumcised, and contained within no place. Augustine says, Christ, as
man, according to his body, August. in Ioh. tract. 21. Cyril in Ioh. lib. 6. c.
14. Fulgent. ad Thrasimind. Vigil. contra Eutych. lib. 4.
is in a place; but as God, fills all places. Cyril says, Though Christ has
taken from hence the presence of his body: yet in the majesty of his deity,
he is always present. Fulgentius says, One and the same Christ, a local Man
of a Woman his mother, who is the infinite God of God his Father. Vigilius the
Martyr, Christ is in all places, according to the nature of his deity: but is
contained in one place, according to the nature of his humanity. Damascene, The
difference of natures in Christ is not taken away Damasc. apud. Euagrium lib.
2. histor. c. 4. Leo. in solemn. natiuit. ser. 1.
by their union in one person: but the propriety of each nature is kept safe.
Leo, one of their Popes, Christ has united both natures together by such a
league, that neither glorification does consume the inferior nature, nor
assumption does diminish the superior. To these I might add many more, but
these are sufficient to prove, that this doctrine, touching the truth of
Christ's humanity, now glorified in the heavens; that he has retained our
nature with all the proprieties, sin only and infirmities excepted, is
concordant both with holy Scripture, and with the voited opinions of all
reverend antiquity.

12. Now this doctrine is crossed and contradicted by that other doctrine of
theirs, touching Transubstantiation, and the carnal and corporal presence of
Christ in the Sacrament, for this they teach, that the body of Christ is in the
Sacrament Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. c. 5.
with the whole magnitude thereof, together with a true order and disposition
of parts, flesh, blood, and bone, as he was borne, lived, crucified, rose
again: and yet they say that the same body in the Eucharist, though it has
magnitude and extention, and disposition of parts agreeable to the form of an
humane body, nevertheless does not fill a place, neither is to be extended
nor proportioned to the place Bell. Ibid.
which it possesses: here be pregnant and manifest contradictions, Christ has
one body, and yet many bodies: even as many as there are consecrated hoasts in
the world, that is, it may be a thousand bodies at once; and so his body is
one, and not one at the same time. Again, this body is in heaven in a place,
and the same body at the same instant is on the Altar, without being compassed
about with place: to be in heaven, and to be in earth at one instant, are
contradictory propositions, being understood of finite substances, and not of
that infinite essence which fills all places: for they imply thus much, to be
in heaven, and net to be in heaven; to be in earth, and not to be in earth,
which be the rules of Logic, and Reason the mother of Logic, cannot be
together true. Again, at one moment of time to be above, and yet below, to be
removed far off, and yet be near adjoining, to come to one place, and yet
not to depart from another, are so merely opposite to each other, that they
cannot be reconciled. And lastly, a body to have form, magnitude, extention,
and disposition of parts, and yet not with these to fill a place, is as much as
to say, it is a body, and yet not a body, it is in a place, and yet not in
that very same place: these are contradictions so evident, that it is
impossible for the wit of man to reconcile them.

13. Notwithstanding the advocates of the Romish Synagogue labor might and
maine in this task, and by many Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 3.
arguments endeavor to reunite these oppositions: first, by Gods omnipotency:
secondly, by the qualities of a glorified body: and thirdly, by arguments from
the discourse of reason. From hence they thus argue, All things are possible to
God, and therefore this is possible; neither is there any thing excepted from
the omnipotency of God, save these things, Quae facere non est facere, sed
deficere (as Bellarmine speaks) that is, which to do, is not to do, but to
undo, and do argue rather impotency then potency, of which sort (that one
body should be in many places at once, is not, says he) because it is not in
express words excepted in Scripture, as to lie and to deny himself are. To
this I answer, first, that albeit the Scripture does not expressly except this
from Gods omnipotency, to make one body to be in two places at once, yet
implyedly it does, for it denies power or rather weakness to God to do those
things which imply contradiction: 2. Cor. 1. 19.
of which kind this is, for one body to be in many places at once. And
Bellarmine himself says, that this is a Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 2.
first principle in the light of nature, every thing is, or is not, which being
taken away, all knowledge fails. Secondly, I answer, that the power of God
is not so much to be considered as his will, nor what he can do, but what he
has reucaled in his word, that he will do; for if we argue from his power
to Tertul. aduers. Prax. cap. 10.
the effect, We may devise God (says Tertullian) to do any thing, because he
could do it. And therefore the same Author says, Dei posse, velle est, Dei
nonposse, nolle. God can of stones raise up Children unto Abraham (says John
Baptist.) Mat. 3. 9.
Now if any should hence conclude, that any of Abraham's children were made of
stones, in a proper speech, all would think him to have no more wit then a
stone. And to this accords Theodoret, when he says, That God can do all
Theod. Dial. 3.
things which he will, but God will not do any of these things which are not
agreeable to his nature. But for to make a body to be without quantity, and a
quantity to be without dimension, and dimension without a place, that is as
much to say, a body without a body, and quantity without quantity, and a place
without a place, is contrary to Gods nature; and therefore cannot be agreeable
to his will, and so has no correspondence with his power. And lastly, I
answer, that it is no good reason to say, God can do such a thing, therefore
he does it; but rather thus, God will do such a thing, therefore he can do
it: and thus the Scripture teaches us to reason: Whatsoever pleased the Lord,
that did he in heaven and in Psalm. 135. 6.
earth, and not whatsoever he could do, but whatsouer it pleased him to do;
and the Leper said to our Savior Christ, Master, if thou will, thou can make
me clean: no^, if thou can, thou will; but if thou will, thou can.

14. Secondly, whereas they object that Christ's body after his glorification,
is endued with more excellent qualities then any other natural body, by reason
of that super-excellent glory wherewith it is adorned above all others, and
thereby as he came to his Apostles, the doors being shut, and rose out of his
grave, notwithstanding the stone that lay upon it; and appeared unto Paul on
earth, being at the same time in heaven: so he is in the Eucharist after a
strange and miraculous manner, and yet is in heaven at the same time. I answer
Theodoret. Dial. 2. p. 268.
first with Theodoret, that Christ's body is not changed by his glorification
into another nature, but remains a true body, filled with divine glory: And
with Augustine, that Christ gave Aug. ad Dardan. Epist. 57.
unto his flesh immortality, but took not away nature: and in another place,
That though Christ had a spiritual body after Idem ad Consen. Epist. 146.
his resurrection, yet it was a true body, because he said to his Disciples,
Palpate and videte, feel and see; and as his body was then after his
resurrection, so it is now being in the heavens. Secondly, that when he came
out of the grave, the Angel removed the stone, with Hierome, and Iustine
Martyr: Hierom. in Psalm. 104. Justin Martyr quaest. 117. Theodor. Dial. 2 Cyril
Alex. in Io^. lib. 12. Cap. 53.
and when he entered into the house, the doors being shut, that the doors and
walls yielded unto him a passage, as unto their Creator, with Theodoret, and
Cyrill: and that when he appeared unto Paul going to Damascus, if it was in
the air, or on the earth (as it may be doubted) that then this body was not in
heaven at the same instant: for far be it from us so to pin up our Lord in
the Heavens, that he cannot be where he pleases. And this is Thomas Aquinas
opinion in express Aquin. Sum. q. 57. art. 6. ad 3.
words, which Bellarmine as expressly contradicts.

15. Thirdly, by discourse of reason he thus labors to reconcile these
contradictions, and thus disputes: God being Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. c. 3.
but one simple and invisible essence, is in infinite places at once, and he
might create another world, and fill it with his presence, and be in two worlds
at one instant: and the soul of man is wholly in every part of the body, and
God is able to conserve the soul in a part that is cut off from the body:
therefore it implies no contradiction to be in two places at once: again, one
place may contain two bodies, and yet be not two places, but one; as when
Christ rose out of the grave, the Sepulcher being shut; therefore one body may
be in two places at once, and yet not two bodies, but one. Lastly, there be
many other mysteries of religion as strange and difficult to be conceived as
this, and yet are believed, therefore this also is to be believed as well as
they.

16. A miserable cause sure that needs such defenses: the weakness of these
reasons argues the feebleness of the cause: for, who knows not, but that
there is no similitude between the infinite God and a finite Creature, nor any
proportion betwixt a Spirit and a body: and that a posse, ad esse, from may
be, to must be, is no good consequence? Add that one place cannot hold two
bodies, nor ever did, except they were so united, that in respect of place they
made but one: And lastly, that all those mysteries of Religion which he names,
to wit, the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Resurrection, the Creation, and
Annihilation, etc. have their foundation in holy Scripture, and therefore are
to be received as doct ines of truth, though transcending the sphere of nature
and reason: but this strange mystery of Transubstantiation has no ground in
Scripture, as he himself confesses: Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 23.
and therefore it is not to be believed as the other are, without better
reasons then he brings for the defense thereof: but like lips, like lettuces;
such as the cause is, such are the defenses, both naught and weak, as any man
may see that is not muffled with error; and thus this second contradiction
remains irreconciliable.

17. A third contradiction is also in and about the Sacrament, 3. Contrad.
which is this, they teach that the matter in Sacrament is partly the outward
Elements, and partly the thing signified and represented by them; and that
betwixt these there is a certain relation and similitude, as in Baptism the
outward sign which is water, and the thing signified, which is the blood of
Christ, make the matter of that Sacrament, or the outward wasting, by water,
and the inward, by the Spirit, and the relation is; as the water washes and
purges away all filthiness of the body, so Christ's blood purges away both
the guilt and filth of sin from the soul: and so in the Eucharist, the
Elements of Bread and Wine, together with the body and blood of Christ, are
the matter of the Sacrament, and Bell. de sacram. lib. 1. cap. 18.
the relation is, as those elements do feed, nourish, and strengthen, and
cheer the body of man; so the body and blood of Christ do seed, nourish, and
strengthen, and cheer the soul unto eternal life: and as those elements must
be eaten and digested, or else they nourish not: so Christ must also be eaten,
and, as it were, digested, and after a sort converted into our substance, or
else he is no food unto our souls. This is the very doctrine of the Church of
Rome, and it is agreeable to the truth, for Bellarmine thus speaks, Species
illae significant Bell. de Euchar. lib* 4. cap. 6.
quidem cibum spiritualem, sed non sunt ipsae cibus spiritualis, that is, The
signs in the Scrament signify our spiritual food, but they are not the
spiritual food it self. And in another place he says, that signum in
Sacramento reisignatae similitudinem Idem de Sacra. lib. 1. cap. 11.
gerit, The signs in the Sacrament do bear the similitude of the thing
signified. And in the same Chapter he says more plainly, that God would
never have ordained one thing to signify another, unless it had a certain
analogy or similitude with it. And herein he accords with the Master of
sentences, Lumb. li. 4* did. 1
who defines a Sacrament thus, To be a visible form of an invisible grace,
bearing the Image of that grace. And with Hugo, Hugo lib. 1. part. 9. cap 2.
who says, That a Sacrament is a corporal or material element, propounded
outwardly to the senses, by similitude representing, and by institution
signifying, and by Sanctification containing some invisible and spiritual
grace. And that this relation is in eating and nourishing, Bellarmine in
another place confesses in direct words, when he says, that That same outward
Bell. de Euchar. lib. 4. cap. 6.
eating in the Sacrament, does signify the inward eating and refreshing of the
soul, but is not the cause thereof: and that that is so necessary a
condition, that without it we should not be partakers of that divine
nourishment. And to this agrees Saint Augustine, who plainly affirms, that
if Sacraments Aug. Epist. 23. ad Bonifac.
had not a certain similitude of those things whereof they are Sacraments,
they were not Sacraments at all. And what this similitude is he declares in
another place, where he says, that We receive visible meat in the Sacrament;
but the Sacrament Idem in Johan. tract. 26.
is one thing, and the virtue of the Sacrament is another. And Thomas Aquinas
gives this as a reason why Bread and Wine are the fittest matter of this
Sacrament, because men most commonly Aqui. pa. 3. q. 74.
are nourished therewith: his words are these, As water is assumed in the
Sacrament of Baptism, to the use of spiritual washing, because corporal
washing is commonly made by water: so bread and wine wherewith most commonly
men are nourished, are taken up in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to the
use of the spiritual eating. By which it follows, that if water did not
wash, it was no fit element for the Sacrament of Baptism: so, if bread and
wine do not nourish, they are no fit signs for the Lords Supper: and for this
cause our Savior at the institution of this Sacrament, gave this commandment
to his Disciples, that they should take and eat: and the Apostle 1. Cor. 10.
21. 1. Cor. 11. 20.
calls it the Lords Supper, and the Lords Table.

18. This therefore is their own doctrine, and it is grounded upon the truth.
But listen a little how they contradict this by their miraculous monster
Transubstantiation: for when they say that the substance of the bread and wine
is utterly changed into the body and blood of Christ, and that only the
accidents remain: I would feign know of them how these outward signs do
nourish the body: can the accidents of bread and wine nourish the substance of
the body? must Simile nutritur simili.
there not be a similitude and proportion betwixt the nourishment and the thing
nourished? but betwixt accidents and a substance there is no similitude nor
proportion. Aristotle tells Aristot. de ^nima. 2.
us as much, when he says, that Food does nourish, as it is a substance, and
not as an accident. Now if the outward signs do not nourish the body, what
analogy is there betwixt them and the things signified? or why were they
ordained to represent the spiritual refection of our souls by Christ, if they
minister no corporal refection unto our bodies? or how can they represent that
where of they bear no similitude? for, as in Baptism, if the nature and
substance of the water were taken away, and only accidents did remain, so
that it could not wash, nor cleanse the body, without doubt, it could be no fit
sign to signify the inward ablution of the soul, by the blood of Christ. So
they that take away the nature and substance of the Bread and Wine, and leau^
bare accidents, make it, without all question, a dead and liuelesse Sacrament,
not fit to represent so high a mystery.

19 Behold now the contradictions: first accidents without a substance, that is
to say, accidents, and no accidents; for therefore they are called accidents,
because they adhere, and are joined to a substance, in which they have their
subsistence, and upon which they have their dependence: so that, take away
their substance, and they presently ^urcease to be Arist. metaph. l^^. 5.
text. 35.
accidents. For, Aristotle says* Accidentis esse est in esse: The essence of
an accident is to be in a subject. Secondly, two parts of the Sacraments, the
visible elements, and the invisible grace, and yet but one part of the same
Sacrament: for the elements be taken away, and accidents only remain;
therefore two parts, and not two parts. Thirdly, the external matter of the
Sacrament is the outward elements: and yet there are no elements at all; and so
elements, and no elements, matter, and no matter. Fourthly, the outward
elements are signs of the inward grace, and the same by their doctrine being
but accidents, are signs of the outward elements, which are signs of the
inward grace: and so they are signs of the signs, rather then of the thing
signified. Lastly, the outward feeding by bread and wine, represents the inward
feeding, by the body and blood of Christ: and yet there is no outward feeding
by bread and wine, because there is no bread and wine, except they will make
accidents to ^eede a substance: which is against all reason: for the
Philosopher Arist. de ^ene^. lib. 2.
says, that Ex i^sdem nutrimur, ex quibus sumus, we are nourished by the same
things, of which we consist: but we do not consist of accidents, but of
substances.

20. Out of this snare they seek to rid themselves by a double evasion;
first, they say, that accidents may be without a subject, though not naturally,
yet by the supernatural power Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 24.
of God. This is Bellarmines: and he proves it by two instances; first,
because Saint Basil affirms, that That light which was created the first day,
was without a subject: and secondly, because as the substance of Christ's
humanity had no subsistence in it self, but in the word; so, though an
accident naturally does inhere in a subject, yet supernaturally it may be, and
yet not inhere. To this I answer: first, that though Saint Basil be of that
opinion, yet Saint Augustine is Au^. in Ger. ad Li^. lib. 1. ca. 3.
not; for he thought it to be a spiritual and no natural light. Nor Beda,
Lyran^s, and the master of sentences, who supposed Damas. de ^ide lib. 2. cap.
7.
it to be a bright and lightsome cloud* which was carried about, and gave
light unto the world. Nor Damascene, who supposed that this light proceeded
from the element of fire, as an effect thereof. Nor yet the Fathers, who though
they differed in their opinions touching this light, yet none of them were of
Saint Basils mind, to think that it was an accident without a subject. Now,
why should we believe Saint Basil herein, more then S. Augustine, venerable Bede, Damascene, or the rest? This therefore is but one private man's opinion,
crossed by many others, and so makes little for his purpose.

21. Secondly, I answer, that though the humanity of Christ had no
subsistence in it self, yet by reason of the union with the Godhead, it was
sustained and vpholden by it: but there is no such union betwixt the accidents
in the Sacraments, and the body and blood of Christ, that the body and blood of
Christ should sustain and uphold those accidents: and therefore they
themselves say, that they are not sustained by the body of Christ, but by the
extraordinary power of God; and so this instance makes nothing for this
purpose neither. Lastly, I answer, that we are not so much to consider what
God can do by his omnipotent power, as what he has done heretofore, or what
he has said he will do hereafter: let them therefore show, that accidents
have been without a substance in times past, or that God has said, he will
have them so to be, and then we will yield unto them: but till then we have
more reason to hold conclusions of nature not crossed by religion, then to
rely upon supernatural imaginations.

22. The second evasion is by Aquinas, who affirms that Aquin. par. 3. q. 77.
art. 6.
supernaturally, the accidents of bread and wine may nourish, because they
receive miraculously the strength and virtue of a substance, and that they do
nourish he proves, because by the same reason they may be turned into the
substance of the body, by the which they are turned into ashes and worms: and
also because we see by experience that the body is nourished by the signs in
the Sacrament: to which a short answer will suffice: for first that there
should be such a miraculous nourishing by accidents, has no ground either in
experience, or in Scripture. And secondly, he should rather conclude, because
the body is nourished by outward elements, and they are often converted into
ashes and worms, therefore they are not bare accidents but substances, then
that therefore bare accidents may nourish: for let the reader judge whether
concludes more reasonably, we, when we say the elements do nourish the body:
therefore they are bodily substances; or they that thus reason, the elements do
nourish the body, therefore accidents without a substance may nourish: and
thus the snare is not broken, neither are they escaped.

23. A fourth contradiction, and that about the Sacrament, 4. Contrad.
they hold that the wicked and reprobate receive the body and blood of Christ
in the Sacrament, and yet reap no benefit thereby to their own souls, but
rather judgment and damnation, as if the merits, grace, and virtue of Christ
could be separated from his person: or as if a man could receive life, and yet
not live, sanctification, and not be sanctified, righteousness, and not be
righteous, redemption, and not be redeemed: for all these is Christ made unto
us, Life, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, as the Scripture
testifies. 1. Cor. 1. 30.
Bellarmine spends one whole Chapter in this argument, Bell. de Euchar. lib.
1. cap. 13.
to prove that the wicked receive Christ in the Sacrament, and thereupon
expressly affirms, that though they receive him, yet they receive not his
justifying grace, nor his merits, nor the fruit and effect of his death and
passion together with him. Of the same mind is Aquinas, and the rest of their
Aquin. 3. q. 80. art. 1. and 3.
Divines. Now this position is contrary both to Scripture, Fathers, and to
their own divinity. To Scripture, for our Savior says in express words,
Whosoever eats my flesh, and Ioh. 6. 54. 56.
drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last
day. And again, He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in
me, and I in him. But say they, The wicked, yea, the reprobate, eat the very
flesh, and drink the very blood of Christ. Therefore conclude that they have
eternal life, and dwell in Christ, and Christ in them: neither can they escape
by saying, that the spiritual eating of Bell. de Euchar* lib. 1. cap. 6.
Aquin. 3. p. q. ^^. art. 2.
Christ by faith, and not the eating in the Sacrament is here understood,
seeing they do all (for the most part) interpret this place of the
Sacramental eating and drinking: but more plain (if it be possible) is that
of S. John, Ioh. 5. 12. He that has the Son, has life: and he that has
not the Son of God, has not life. From which place thus a man may reason, He
that has Christ, has eternal life, but he that receives Christ verily and
truly, as all the wicked do in the Sacrament by their doctrine, has Christ:
therefore the very reprobate, even Judas himself, has eternal life, and is
saved: for either they must deny that they receive Christ in the Sacrament; or
else they must grant, being convicted by these Scriptures, that together with
him they receive eternal life.

25. They reply to this two things, first, that the wicked receive Christ only
Sacramentally, and not Spiritually, and therefore they have no benefit by him:
and secondly, because they receive him unworthily, therefore they receive their
own judgment and not salvation, not discerning the body and blood of Christ.
To which I answer, that though they receive Sacramentally, and unworthily, yet
by their doctrine they receive v^ry Christ: and so by these Scriptures it must
needs follow, that they also receive the fruit and effect of his death, which
is life and salvation. Add hereunto, that the terms here used are general,
both in respect of the persons that receive, and also the manner of receiving,
without any such exception or distinction, as they devise: and therefore I
conclude, that it is as impossible to make a separation betwixt Christ and his
saving grace, as to separate the Sun from light, fire from heat, or the
soul from natural life.

26. Thus this position is an opposition to Scripture, so it is also to the
opinions of the Fathers. To give a taste of some two or three, Origin says,
That Christ is that true meat, which Orig. in Mat. cap. 15. August. de Ciuit.
lib. 21. c. 25.
whosoever eats shall live for ever which no wicked man can eat. Augustine
more effectually says, He that is in the unity of Christ's body, that is, a
member of Christ, he is truly said to eat Christ's body, and drink his blood.
Note, he says truly, to signify that all other eat him falsely, that is in
show and not in substance. And in another place yet more plainly, He Idem in
Sent. ^ent. 339.
which disagreeth from Christ, does neither eat his flesh, nor drink his
blood, though he take the Sacrament of so great a thing to his judgment.
Theodoret as plainly says, That Christ is Theodor. in Psalm. 32. Cyril. in
Ioh. lib. 4. Basil. in. Psalm. 3.
meat for his own sheep only, that is, his elect. And Cyrill that as many
as eat his flesh, have life in them being joined to him who is life it self.
And Basil says, that they which are fed with the food of life, to wit, the
bread that came down from heaven, have an inward mouth of the mind whereby
they eat that spiritual food. Many more such like sayings might be heaped
together to this purpose, which for breuity sake I pass over: all which are
contrary to that Romish position, that the wicked eat and drink the very body
and blood of Christ; which they must needs do, if the bread and wine, after
the words of consecration, be changed into the very body and blood of Christ.

27. Lastly, it is contrary to their own divinity: for they hold, that the
parts of this Sacrament, as of all others, are two, to wit, the matter and the
form: the form in this Sacrament Bell de Sacram. lib. 1. cap. 18.
is to the whole word of consecration, together with the sense thereof: the
matter is the whole element, with the signification thereof. As for example, in
the Eucharist, the matter is the species of Bread and wine, containing under
them the body and blood of Christ: and the form is ( for this is my body,
this is my blood.) Now, hence I thus reason. The wicked either receive the
whole Sacrament, or they receive it not; if they do, then there is no
difference betwixt the faithful and them, for they receive no more; and why
should not they be saved then as well as they? if they do not, then either they
receive not Christ at all, because we are sure they receive the outward
Elements: and therefore if any thing be wanting, it must needs be the thing
signified, or there are more parts then these two of the Sacrament. Again thus
if the wicked receive Christ in the Sacrament, and yet not the virtue of
Christ, then they receive not the whole Sacrament, because the virtue of the
Sacrament is in the Sacrament, as the virtue of every thing is in the thing it
self. And so it follows, that the wicked in the Sacrament receive Christ,
and yet not Christ the whole Sacrament, and yet but a part of the Sacrament:
and that there are but two parts of it, and yet more then two. Observe (gentle
Reader) these contradictions, and wonder.

28. Again, Transubstantiation is contradicted both by the 5. Contrad.
doctrine of adoration of Images, and by the Canon of the Mass: by the
doctrine of adoration of Images thus; they teach that divine adoration is to be
given to the pictures, of Christ, and God the Father, because they represent
their most excellent and divine persons, and yet they would have the very body
and blood of Christ to be in the Sacrament transubstantiated, because some of
the Fathers pretend ^o say, that it is to be adored with divine worship. Now,
if it be true that they say, that Images of God the Father, and of Christ our
Savior, ought to be adored with divine worship, because they represent their
persons: then it must be false, that therfeore the body and blood of Christ
are really and carnally in the Sacrament, because it is to be worshipped: for,
why may not those mysteries of bread and wine instituted by Christ, to put us
in mind of his death and passion, be, for such their effectual
representation, adored and worshipped with divine worship, as well as Images
and pictures for their representation, especially seeing they carry a more
exact resemblance and lively signification of him then any picture can do?
Here is a plain contradiction betwixt the proof of their Transubstantiation,
and their doctrine of adoration of Images, standing upon these terms, An Image
must be worshipped, because it represents the person of Christ: but the
Sacrament is not to be worshipped, though it represents Christ more fully then
any Image, except he be corporally and substantially present in it.

29. Secondly, it is crossed by the Canon of the Mass diverse 6. Contrad.
ways: First, by the prayer that is used before the elevation, where the
Priest desires God to behold the same sacrifice with a propitious and
favorable countenance, like as the sacrifices of Abel, Abraham, Melchizedech
etc. If Christ were really offered by the Priest, he need not pray that God
would be propitious to that sacrifice, for in him he is ever well pleased:
neither can his sacrifice be possibly disrespected of God, being of infinite
merit and price to satisfy the rigor of his Fathers justice: it were
therefore either horrible blasphemy in their Mass to equalize this absolute
sacrifice of Christ, with the imperfect sacrifices of Abel, and Abraham, which
stood in need of Gods merciful acceptance: or it is false, that Christ is
really sacrificed in the Mass: one of the two must needs be either blasphemy
in the Canon of the Mass, or falsehood in their doctrine of Transubstantiation.

30. Again, by another prayer which is used in the consecration, 7. Contrad.
where the Priest prays, that God would command those things to be carried by
the hands of the holy Angel up to the high Altar, into the sight of the divine
Majesty. Now by these words (those things haec) cannot be understood Christ,
neither in Grammatical construction, nor in any religious sense: for in true
Grammatical Latin, he should have said, if he had meant Christ, either hunc,
this; or hoc, viz. sacrifici^^ this sacrifice, and not haec, these things: for
though the elements be two, yet by their own doctrine whole Christ is in each
of them, and therefore cannot be spoken of in the plural number, as if he
were either divided in himself, or multiplied to more then himself: and in
the construction of religion it can be no less then blasphemy to imagine, that
an Angel must carry up Christ into Heaven, and present him there upon the high
Altar to the divine majesty; for it implies in him either inability, or
unwillingness to present himself: to say he is unable, is to deny him to be
God, and so Almighty: and to say he is unwilling, is to deny him to be our
high Priest and Mediator, to whose office it only pertains to offer up the
sacrifices of the faithful under the Gospel, as the Priest in the law of
Moses might only offer the sacrifices of the law, and enter into the most holy
place, to make reconciliation for the people: so that it remains, that the
composer of the Mass could not understand by ( haec) these things, Christ
himself: but the elements Bread and Wine which are a representation and
commemoration of that one all-sufficient sacrifice on the Cross: and so either
the Mass is erroneous, or Transubstantiation a false doctrine; for if the
Mass be true, then Transubstantiation is false; and if Transubstantiation be
true, then the Mass is false.

31. Thirdly, it is crossed by their manifold crossings, used 8. Contrad.
by the Priest in the Mass: for, if Christ in person be really present, as a
complete sacrifice, what need such signings or crossings by the earthly hands
of a sinful Priest? is he sanctified by them? that were blasphemy to think.
He needs no sanctification, being the Holy of holies. Is the devil driven
away by these means? that is a greater blasphemy to believe: for he once
conquered the devil, in such sort, that he dares never meddle with him any
more. And yet the blasphemous Jesuits are not afraid to affirm, that the
devils may, and do so come near to their Sacrament, that they Suar^z. tom. 3.
l. 55. sect. 1.
can both carry it away, and abuse it also. Surely, if this be true, then the
devils know, Christ is not there: for they durst not come so near unto him
sacrificed on the Altar, by whose true sacrifice on the Cross, they received
such a deadly wound. Lastly, is God put in mind of his Sons sacrifice on the
Cross, by their crossings of him upon the Altar? This is impudency to think:
for Almighty God cannot forget the sacrifice of his own Son; neither can his
Cross be any whit dignified by their crossings. Which way soever they turn
them, here is either impiety in their Mass, or falsity in their doctrine of
Transsubstantiation.

32. Thus much touching the contradictions in the Eucharist. 9. Contrad.
Now let us see their concordance in other Articles of their Religion; and that
with greater brevity. And first in their Article of Justification, therein
there lurk four maine contradictions: First, they say, that the first
justification, when Censur. Colon. page 140, 141. Becan. disput. page 199.
Trident. Council. sess. 6. cap. 6. Bell* de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 13. Ibid cap.
17.
a man of unjust and wicked, is made just and good, is the free gift of God,
and deserved by no precedent works* and yet they say again, that a man does
prepare and make himself fit for this justification by certain acts of faith,
Fear, Hope, Repentance, and the purpose of a new life. Yea, Bellarmine does
not stick to say, that this faith justifies by way of merit, and deserves
forgiveness of sins after a certain manner. And all of them ^each, that
those dispositions and preparations arise partly from grace, and partly from
free will, as two several and divided agents, and that it is in the power of
man's will, either to accept that grace of God, or to refuse it: as has been
at large discovered in the fourth Reason. Now hear the contradictions: If it
be merely Gods free gift, then it is no ways man's free will: and if it be
any ways man's free will to prepare himself, then it is not every way Gods
free gift* For it is not in this case, as in other external donations: the
King may give a pardon freely, and yet the prisoner may have power to receive
or to refuse the pardon, because the pardon is one thing, and the prisoners
will on other: but in the justification of a sinner, the gift it self is the
very change of the mind, and the will, and the whole man: for it is (as they
say) when a sinner is made righteous, and an unjust man is made just: and so
the will has no power to reject it, when God effectually gives it; nor power
to accept it, till God alter and change it by his grace. And hence it
follows, that to say it is Gods free gift, and yet that we in part prepare
our selves thereunto by our own free will, implies contradiction, as also
this, to merit it, and yet to have it freely given: if it be any ways of
merit, then it is not every way free. Merit in the receiver, and freeness in
the giver, can in no respect stand together.

33. Another contradiction in this Article, is this; that they 10. Contrad.
say a man is justified by his works; and yet for all that, he is justified by
grace too. Both these propositions they peremptorily defend, and take it in
great scorn, that we charge them to be maintayners of works against grace: and
call us loud Liars, in casting that imputation upon them. But by their leaves,
they maintain either works against grace, or else they breathe hot and cold
out of one mouth (which the Satyr could not endure) and speak contraries, let
them choose whether: for the holy Ghost himself places these two, Works and
Grace, in diametrall opposition; If it be of grace, it is no Romans 11. 6.
more of works, or else were grace no more grace: but if it be of works, it is
no more grace; or else were work no more work. Here we see a manifest
opposition betwixt grace and works, so that one does exclude the other, and
this in our election: and therefore much more in our justification, which is
but an effect thereof: for election has nothing to do with our good works,
according to our doctrine, nor with our evil, according to theirs: but
justification has respect unto our sins and evil deeds; and therefore much
greater must be the opposition in this then in that: and greater reason that
here works should be excluded by grace, then in the other.

34 Bellarmines exception is, that the Apostle here excludes Bell. de Justice.
lib. 1. cap. 21.
only the works that be of our selves without grace, before we be justified:
but as for those that come after, they are works of grace, and therefore be not
excluded by grace, but may well stand together. To which I answer three
things: First, that the Apostle has no such distinction, but speaks
generally of all works; and therefore according to the old rule, Vbi lex non
distinguit: Where the law distinguishes not, there we must not distinguish. To
say therefore that it is both by grace and works, is to confront the Apostle,
and to fasten upon him a flat contradiction. Yea, it is to extinguish grace
utterly: for as it has been before alleged out of Augustine, grace is not
grace in any respect, except it be free in every respect. Secondly, that the
Apostle means works after grace, and such as proceed from faith, as well as
works of nature, appears by another like place; where works are also
excluded, and opposed to the free gift of God, that is, to Ephesians. 2. 8.
grace: and that the Apostle intends works of grace, appears by the reason
following in the next verse ( For we are his workmanship, created in Christ to
good works.) Now in this last place, works of grace must needs be understood,
because he says, we are created in Christ Jesus unto them: and therefore the
same also must necessarily be meant in the former: unless we will say, that
the Apostle, or rather the holy Ghost, disputes not ad idem. Lastly, I answer,
that in Abraham's justification, who was the Father of the faithful, and Romans
4. 2.
his justification a pattern, how all his spiritual posterity should be
justified, works of grace are excluded: for at that time, of which the Apostle
there speaks, Abraham was regenerate, as Bellarmine himself acknowledges:
and yet his works are excluded: therefore works of grace are meant by the
Apostle. I, but replyeth the same Cardinal, when the Apostle Bell. Ibid. c. 19.
says, that Abraham was justified by faith, and not by works, he excludes
those works which Abraham might do without faith: for they which have faith,
yet do not always work by faith: as when they sin, or perform mere
moral duties, without relation to God. But this is no better then a mere
shift, without any ground of reason or truth: for if it be true which the
Scripture says, that whatsoever is not of faith, is sin; then those moral
works, which he mentions, being not of faith, are no better then sins, and
so need not to be excluded by the Apostle; for they exclude themselves.
Besides, it is manifestly false, that a just, and faithful man, does any
work, which is not sin, wherein he has not relation unto God; if not in the
particular act, yet in the general purpose of his mind: for, every morning he
prays to God for the direction of all his ways, and that all his works may
be sanctified by his Spirit. And thus it appears, that in saying, we are
justified by grace, and yet by works too, they speak contraries.

35. A third contradiction in this Article is about their 11. Contrad.
works of Preparation, which, they say, go before the first justification:
these they call, virtuous dispositions, good qualities, Bell. de Iustif. l. 1.
cap. 21. Bishop. contra Resor. Cathol. art. 35.
good preparations, merits of congruitie; and that they have a dignity of
work in them: and yet they say again, that no good works go before the first
justification: belike then they are both good, and not good, by their doctrine:
and therefore thus I argue: If they be not good, why do they call them good? if
they be good, then it is untrue, that no good works go before the first
justification of a sinner: either in the one, or in the other, they must needs
err; and in holding both, the one part of their doctrine crosses the other.

36. Fourthly, they say, that faith alone does not justify: 12. Contrad. Bell.
de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 13. Osor. Dom. 23. post Pentec. con. 2. Milet. contra
Heshus.
and yet, notwithstanding, they say, Fide Catholica Christiana eaque sola
hominem iustificari, nulli vnquam negauerunt, nec ^egant Pontificij. That no
Papist ever has, or does deny, that a man is justified by the Catholic
Christian faith, and that alone. This is the assertion of Miletus, against
Heshusius; and it is not condemned by any of the rest; but his book approved
as containing nothing contrary to their Catholic Religion: and so it seems to
be one of their Catholic doctrines. And Bellarmine insinuates as much, though
not in plain Bell. Ibid.
speech, yet by necessary consequence, when be says, that faith is the
beginning, and first root of justification. Now if it be so, then as soon as
a man has faith, justification is begun, and takes root in him, even before
he has any other grace: and if it has taken root, then it is either whole
justification, or a piece thereof: but a piece it cannot be; for it is
indivisible; therefore, either whole or none. For grant there be degrees in
justification (as they say) which nevertheless they are never able to prove:
yet they be degrees of persection, not of essence: as a man is a man as soon
as he is borne, though not a perfect man before he come to complete age,
stature, and strength. So their supposed justification, is justification in the
root, though not perfect and absolute, until it come to ripe age. I speak in
their language, because I deliver their own doctrine. Now how can these two
contraries be reconciled? Faith alone does not justify, and yet faith alone
does justify? If they say, that they speak of one kind of faith, and we of
another, they say nothing to the purpose: for even that any faith alone should
justify, is contrary to their own positions, who affirm, that the former
cause of our justification, is the inherent righteousness of Bell. de Iustif.
lib. 1. cap. 18.
works: and not the righteousness of Christ, apprehended by faith. And thus I
leave the Article of justification at far with it self, to be atoned by
their best wits, if it be possible.

37. Let us come to their doctrine of works, and see how 13. Contrad.
that agrees with it self: and here first they hold, that works done before
faith and regeneration, are not good works, but sins. This is proved by them
out of Saint Augustine, who Aug. lib. 4. in Julian. cap. 3.
affirms, that the works of unbelievers are sins: and if the works of
unbelievers, then of all other wicked men which be not regenerate; seeing, as
the same Father elsewhere speaks, Impij cogitant, non credunt, the wicked
do not believe, but think; they have but a shadow of faith, without
substance. It may be proved also by that general and infallible axiom of the
holy Scripture, Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin: but the works of wicked
men are all void of faith, and therefore are no better then sins in the sight
of God, be they never so glorious and beautiful in the eyes of men. Or
Nazianz. orat. in sanct. Lauac.
as Gregory Nazianzene says, As faith without works is dead, so works
without faith are dead: and dead works are sins, as appears, Heb. 9. 41.
Besides, Bellarmine confirms the same by reason, because they want a good
intention to direct their works to the glory of the true God, whom they are
ignorant of. To which I add another reason drawn from our Saviors own
mouth, Mat. 7. Because an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit: but every
man, til he be ingrafted into Christ, is no better then an evil tree, and
therefore cannot do a good work.

38. This is their doctrine, and it is sound divinity: but see how they cross
it over the face with a contrary falsehood; for the same men that teach this,
notwithstanding affirm, that the works of Infidels are good, suo genere, in
their kind: Bell, de iustif. lib. 4. cap. 16.
so they are good, and not good; sins, and yet good works: but this is in
their kind, say they, that is, Morally, and not Theologically. I, but moral
virtues in the unregenerate are (by their own principles) sins: how then can
they be good any ways? Can sin, which is a transgression of Gods law, and
simply in it own nature evil, be in any respect good, as it is sin? But to
take clear away this scruple, another of them avouches, that they are not
only morally, but even Theologically good; for he says, that such works as
are done Salmer. Jesuit. tit. 15. page 41.
by the light of nature only, without grace, do dispose and make a man in
some sort fit to justification, though it be long and valderemote, remotely,
and a far off; for he that yields obedience to moral laws, is thereby
less undisposed and repugnant to divine grace. Now, how can sins dispose or
prepare a man for justification? is God delighted with sins? Either therefore
they are not sins, or they do not dispose to justification, neither far
nor near: or which is the present contradiction, they are sins and not
sins, good and not good, at one time, and in one and the same respect. And to
put the contradiction out of all question, the Council of Trent in the seventh
Canon of the sixth Session, enacteth as Council. Trident. Sess. 6. ca. 7.
much, and denounces Anathema to all that say the contrary: the words are
these, If any man shall say, that all the works which are done before
justification, by what means soever they are done, are truly sins, or
deserve the hatred of God, let him be Anathema. And Andradius the interpretor
of that Council, Andradius.
authorized by the Fathers of the same, does more perspicuously explain the
meaning of that Canon, when he says, that men without faith, destitute of the
spirit of regeneration may do works which are void of all filthiness, free
from all fault, and defiled with no sin, and by which they may obtain
salvation: then which, what can be more contradictory to that which before was
delivered, that all the works of Infidels and unbelievers are sins, be they
never so glistering with moral virtue? or more agreeable to the old condemned
errors of Iustine, Clemens, and Epiphanius, who affirmed that Socrates, and Her
aclitus were Christians, because they lived according to the rule of reason:
and that the Grecians were justified by Philosophy: and that many were saved
only by the law of nature, without the law of Moses, or Gospel of Christ?

39. Again, their doctrine of doubel merit, the one of 14. Contrad.
Congruity, the other of Condignity, as they term them, is not only contrary
to the truth, but to it self. For this they teach, that the merit of
congruity, which the Council of Trent calls the preparations and
dispositions to justification, is grounded upon the dignity of the work, and
not upon the promise of God: but the merit of condignity requires both a
dignity of the work, and the promise of God to be grounded upon, or else it
is no merit. This is Bellarmines Bell. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 21.
plain doctrine, and is consonant to the residue of their Doctors, both
School divines, and others: for thus they define the merit of congruity, It is
that by which the subject is Compend. Theol. lib. 5. cap. 11.
disposed, that it may receive grace according to the reason of Gods justice.
Here is only justice required, and not any promise to the merit of congruity;
though (I must confess) Gabriel Biel Gabriel. 3. Sent. did. 27.
somewhat crosses this definition, when ^e says, that when a man does what in
him lies, then God accepts his work, and powers in grace, not by the due
of Justice, but of his liberality. And Aquinas, who affirms, that when a man
uses well the Aquinas. 2. 2 ae. q. 114. art. 2. Coster. Enchir. page 284.
power of free will, God works in him according to the excellency of his
mercy. But yet they all agree in this, that the merit of congruity is not
grounded upon any promise, as the merit of condignity is, but only upon the
worthin^s of the work done. Now here lurketh a flat contradiction, for by this
it should follow, that the merit of congruity should be more properly a merit
then that of condignity. Which Bellarmine denies in the same Chapter, because
this depends upon it own dignity, and has no need of a promise, as the
other has: and so should be also more meritorious and excellent then the
other; being nevertheless but a preparation and beginning to justification,
and the other the matter of justification it self. And that a man that has no
grace dwelling in him* but only outwardly moving him, nor is yet justified,
should have more power to deserve and merit, then he that is fulfilled with
grace, and fully justified. Thus error, like a Strumpet, brings forth a
monstrous brood of absurdities: but let us proceed.

40. Their merit of condignitie brings forth a like 15. Contrad.
monster; for they build it upon two foundations, whereof Bell. de Iustif. lib.
1. cap. 21. Coster. Enchir. page 284. etc. Aquin. 1. 2. q. 114. art. 6. Bell.
de Iustif. lib. 5. cap. 14. Coster. Enchir. page 285. Bell. de Justif. lib. 5.
cap. 17.
one ouerwhelmeth the other: to wit, the dignity of the work, and the promise
of God: for what can be more contrary, then mercy and justice? Now if it depend
upon the dignity of the work, then it is a due of justice: and so they call
it, Meritum ex iustitia. A merit by justice: but if it rely upon the free
promise of God (as they call it,) then it must needs be, Meritum ex
misericordia. A merit by mercy: for Gods promise is a voluntary fruit of his
mercy. They answer, that they may both well stand together: for, say they, God
deals with us, as we deal with our hired laborers; we agree with them for a
certain price, for doing a piece of work, and when they begin, we give them
an earnest penny; and when the work is done, according to the covenant, we
give them their wages: So deals Almighty God with Christians; he first makes
a covenant with them, that for laboring in his Vineyard they Mat. 20. 2.
shall have a penny, that is, eternal life: then he gives them the Ephesians. 1.
13.
earnest of his Spirit, to assure them thereof: and lastly, at the end, when
they have done their work, he pays them their wages. Apoc* 22. 12.
But by the Jesuits leave, this similitude is lame of all four: for first,
when a man hyreth a labourer, and bargaineth with him for wages for his work:
this is a covenant of justice, and no promise of mercy: and therefore if he
perform this bargain, he is not therefore called merciful, but just: but
Almighty God, as they themselves confess, promises freely, and is bound to
none: and therefore this must needs be a work of mercy, and not of justice.
Secondly, there is a proportion betwixt the laborers work and his hire: but
betwixt the Kingdom of heaven, and our good works, there is no proportion, no
more then betwixt a finite, and an i^ finite thing: or a drop of a B^cket, and
the huge Ocean. And third y a man stands in need of his workman and his
work: but God has no need of us. And hence it must of necessity Job. 35. 7.
follow, that the laborers hire i^ a debt of justice: but a Christians hire is
a reward of mercy. And so I conclude, that being of mercy, it cannot be of
justice too; or if it be of justice, it cannot be of mercy t^o: f^^ what need^
justice, if it be of mercy? and what need mercy, if ^^ b^ of justice? And
therefore if this merit^ of condignitie be grounded upon the worth and valor
of he work done (as they teach) (...) cannot be grounded upon the promise of
God, as the^ teach also; because the dignity of the work requires ^^ as a d^^
by justice, and the gracious promise of God imparts it, as a ^eward of mercy.

41. Again, in their merit of congruitie there is another 16. Contrad. Bell
de iustif. lib. 5. cap. 21. Co^c^^. Trident. Sess 6. c. 13. ^an. 4.
contradiction: for they teach, that the who^e dignity of the work depends
upon grace; and therefore that it is not so much man that meriteth, as Gods
grace in man. And yet the same affirm* that this grace does not inhabitare:
that is, awell in a man; but only outwardly move and help him: and that it
is in man's power, either to accept, or reject the^s me Now how can the power of
meriting issue from grace alone, and the whole dignity of the work depend
upon grace, when as that grace is not in us, and when as our own free will is
the chief worker, being able of it self, either to unlock the door, and let
it in, or ba^re the door, and shut it out? And besides, if the whole dignity
of the work depend upon Bell. Ibid.
grace, why does he call ^t Meritum in^hoatum and imperfectu^? A lame and
imperfect meri^e? I Gods grace ^ame and imperfect? either therefore that grace
dwells in us, and is the chiese worker* or else it does not wholly depend
upon grace. And again, if it wholly proceed from grace, then it is not a lame
and imperfect, but a complete and perfect merice. See, ^ beseech you, how
falsehood needs no other Engine but it self to overthrow it.

42. Lastly, concerning works, their doctrine is, that the 17. Contrad. Council.
Trident Sess. 6. cap. 11. can. 25. Bell. de Iustif. lib. 4. cap. 10.
good works of the regenerate are fully and absolutely just, and perfectly
good: and yet nevertheless, that they may grow in goodness, and are also
mixed with many venial sins. If they be perfectly good, how can they grow
in goodness? and if they increase in goodness, how are they perfectly good,
seeing that only is perfect, to which nothing can be added? If they say that
this perfection is but begun, and not finished; why then also, they should say,
that they are imperfectly perfect: or else, they pull down with one hand, that
which they build with the other. And again, if they, most holy and just men,
have their works intermixed with many venial sins, for which they need to cry
daily, Forgive us our trespasses, how can they either perfectly fulfill the law
of God, or do such works as may be able to abide the censure of Gods justice,
seeing Saint James says, that he that transgresses one Commandment, Iam. 2.
10.
is guilty of the whole law, because he violateth the body of justice,
contained in the law? as he which hurts the little toe, does herein wrong the
whole body. It is a contradiction therefore, to say, that the works of the
regenerate are perfect, and yet are intermingled with many sins: and it is
all one, as if a man should say, that his face is perfectly clean, and yet
has many spots: or that the body is perfectly in health, and yet is pestred
with many diseases.

43. And thus much of good works. Now, besides these, 18. Contrad.
there are certain works in their Religion, which are more then good, and more
perfect then perfection: these be their works of Supererogation, arising from
three grounds: First, Bell. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 6. 7.
when the Saints in this life do more good works, then are necessary for
themselves to the attainment of salvation. And secondly, when they suffer more
and greater punishments then are due unto them for their sins. And thirdly,
when they undertake, no^ only works, commanded by the law of God* but also,
such as are commended by the Evangelical Counsels: as, voluntary poverty,
abstayning from marriage, and regular obedience. These superabounding actions
and passions of Gods Saints, are the works of supererogation, spoken of, and
magnified so much in the Church of Rome: which both are the Churches Treasure,
mingled with the superabounding merits of Christ's passion; and are laid up in a
Treasury, the keys whereof and dispensation is committed to the Pope of Rome,
that he, either by himself or his Factors, may dispense them at his pleasure:
that is, to them that will buy the same for money: and also (as they say) are
more excellent, and perfect, and meritorious of a greater reward. This
blasphemous doctrine might easily be wounded to death by the Sword of the
Spirit: for it is contrary to all Religion, and to the experience of every man's
own conscience. But I leave this to others, who have, or shall meddle in this
argument: my task is to show, how it contradicts both it self, and other
doctrines of their Religion.

44. It self, thus: They teach, that works of supererogation, Bell. Ibid.
grounded upon Evangelical Counsels, are (as you have heard) more excellent,
perfect, and meritorious, then those which are done in obedience to the law of
God: and that in three respects: First, comparing several Counsels with
several Precepts which concern the same matter: As, to sell all and give to
the poor, is a more excellent work, then any commanded in that Precept, Thou
shall not steal. And the Counsel of Single life, is more perfect then the
Precept, Thou shall not commit Adultery. As if men could be more perfect then
God had commanuded, or then Christ himself was, whose righteousness consisted
in this, in being obedient to his Heb. 10. 7. Psalm. 103. 20.
Fathers will. Or then the Angels, whose perfection consists in executing the
Commandments of God. Or, as if the law of God was not a perfect rule of
righteousness. Secondly, comparing the state of men, observing Evangelical
Counsels, with the state of them that only yield obedience to Precepts: as if
a man could be in a higher and happier estate then they are, which love God
with all their heart; and their Neighbor as themselves: which is the sum of
the Law. And thirdly, (mark this) comparing Counsels with any precept
whatsoever, even with that great Commandment of the Law, Thou shall love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, Mat. 22. 37. 38.
and with all thy strength. As if a man could love God more then with all his
heart, and with all his strength. Gods children labor for so much, let them
take the more for their shares. Hence they conclude, that in respect of matter,
the Precept is good; but the Counsels better: and in respect of Bell. de Mona
h. lib. 2. cap. 7.
the end, the fulfilling of Precepts has a reward; but the execution of
Counsels has a greater reward. This is their plain doctrine. And yet
nevertheless the same men teach, that the perfection of a Christian man
consists essentially, in the observation of Precepts: and instrumentally, in
the observation Bell. Ibid, c. 6.
of Counsels. And secondly, that the Precepts of charity are the ends
whereunto Counsels are ordained: and the works of Counsels are but the way and
means for the better Aquin. 2. 2. q. 184. art. 3. Idem. Ibid. q. 189. Salmer.
c. 7. page 37.
keeping of the Precepts. Now to the purpose. How can works of supererogation
be more perfect then works of obedience? Counsels then Precepts? seeing
perfection consists in the one instrumentally, and in the other essentially,
and Precepts are the end of Counsels, and not Counsels of Precepts? Is an
isntrumental perfection greater then an essential? or the means more perfect
then the end? This is contrary to natural reason: for Aristotle says, Maius
bonum Aristot. Rethor. lib. 1. cap. 7.
est finis, quam quod finis non est. The end is a greater good then that which
is not the end: and the instrument is never so perfect as the essence of a
thing. 19. Contrad. Council. Trident. Sess. 6. c. 11. can. 25. Bell. de Justif.

partic. l. 1. c. 6. Iam 3. 2. ^idem de great. and lib. arbit l. 6. c. 10


45. Again, it crosses another of their doctrines thus: They teach, that
though the law of God be possible to be kept by the regenerate, and the works
of the faithful be simply and absolutely just: yet they are mixed with many
venial sins: and therefore there is none so just, but that sins
sometimes, and has need to use that petition in the Lords Prayer daily,
Forgive us our trespasses. According to that general axiom of Sain: James, In
many things we sin all. Yea, Bellarmine himself affirms, that the
regenerate may fall into many deadly sins, and that he cannot possibly avoid
venial sins, Nisi priuilegio singulari: But by a singular privilege. Which
privilege he cannot instance to have been granted to any man living or dead,
except Christ only, who was God and man. Observe now the contradiction: (to
omit that this necessity of sinning does overthrow the possibility of
fulfilling the law, and does imply an impossibility) how can these two
extremes be reconciled? The regenerate cannot perform all they should do, and
yet do perform more then they should do. They cannot avoid venial sins, and
yet can supererogate. It is as much as to say, that a man is not able to pay
his own debts, but must ask pardon for them; and yet has ability to pay
another man's, far greater then his own. Or, an Archer cannot by any means
shoot home to the mark and yet with the same Bow and Arrows, sent forth by
the same strength of his arm, he can shoot far beyond the mark. He that is
tainted and stained with many venial sins, in that respect, is not perfect:
but he that does supererogate, is more then perfect: For so they say, when
they give a higher Bell. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 2.
degree of perfection to these works, then to the perfect obedience of the law.
If they say, that venial sins do not hinder the perfection of good works: I
answer, that nevertheless, they hinder the perfection of the worker: and if
they stick fast to the work it self, they hinder that also: as the least spot
of ink blemisheth the whole face, and the lightest disease disableth the
health of the whole body. Either therefore they must deny them to be sins,
and so spots and defects in the souls of the regenerate: or they must
confess, that they are not so perfect as they should be. And how then can they
be more perfect then they should be?

46. Further, they teach, that one degree of superero gating 20. Contrad. Bell.
de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 8. Salmer. tom. 5. tract. 5. Bell. de Monach. lib. 2.
cap. 2.
perfection, is the vow of Monastical poverty, renouncing all propriety in
worldly goods, and holding in Common the use of temporal things: and yet they
say, that the state of Bishops, who possess lands and goods, and enjoy the
propriety of them, is more perfect then the state of Monks; who deprive
themselves thereof, because Bishops have already atchiued this perfection, and
Monks are but in the way to it. From which ground a man may thus argue: If
perfection consist in voluntary poverty, which is an alienation of all
propriety of worldly goods; then Bshiops, possessing Lordships and revenues,
are not more perfect then Monks, that have renounced all: and if Bishops,
possessing, be more perfect then Monks, not possessing, then perfection
consists not in the alienation of all propriety of worldly goods. One or the
other must needs be false, except he will place perfection in two
contraries: to wit, possessing, and not possessing. And the rather may this
absurdity appear, because, ask them, why Monks are more perfect then other
men? they will answer, because they remove from them all impediments of their
love to God (in which rank they place worldly wealth) and consecrate
themselves wholly to Gods service. By which reason, Bishops cannot be more
perfect then either they or other men, because they retain those impediments:
and so by their doctrine, do not wholly consecrate themselves to Gods service.

47. From their actions, let us come to their passions: to 21. Contrad.
wit, their Satisfactions, or, as Melanchton calls them, Satispassions,
wherein there are as fat and foggie contradictions, as in the former. For,
first they teach, that Christ has made a perfect and full sufficient
satisfaction for all the Elect; and that Council. Trident. Sess. 4. c. 8. Bell.
de poenit. lib. 4. cap. 14. Coster. Enchir. page 395.
his death was a sufficient price for the redemption and expiation of the
sins of the whole world: and that his satisfaction was of infinite value,
etc. This they affirm in semblance of words, because, if they should not, all
men would cry shame upon their Religion. And yet, in truth, they overthrow the
same by another cross doctrine of our own satisfactions: for the same men
say, that Christ has only satisfied for the fault of our sins, and the
eternal punishment due unto them: but we our selves must satisfy for the
temporal Council. Trident. Sess. 4. cap. 10. c. 12. and 13. Bell. de poenit.
lib. 4. cap. 4. and 3. and 7.
punishment, either here on earth, by necessary afflictions, or in Purgatory,
by the indurance of those pains which are there ordained to purge men withal.
Now what can be more contrary then these two propositions? Christ has made a
full satisfaction for us; and yet we must also satisfy in part for our selves.
If Christ's satisfaction be full and perfect, then it has paid the whole debt
which we ought: but if we must pay part of the debt, then is not this
satisfaction full and perfect. That the temporal punishment is a part of our
debt, Bellarmine himself confesses, writing upon the fi^ft petition Bell. de
bonis ^per. in partic. ^. ^. cap. 6.
of the Lords Prayer, where he gives this one reason, why sins are called
debts: because he which breaks the Law, is a debtor, to undergo the
punishment which the Law requires. But the Law binds transgressors, not
only to eternal, but also to temporary and transitory punishments. As a
Surety therefore, that pays for his friend, owing an hundred pound,
fourescoreand ten, leaving the remainder to the debtor himself to be
satisfied, cannot be said, to have made full satisfaction: So, if any part of
our debt is to be paid by our selves, Christ, our all-sufficient Surety,
cannot be said to have made a full satisfaction. But they answer, that this
our satisfaction Council. Trident. ^ess. 4. cap. 8.
is wrought in us by Christ; and is so in us, that it is not of us, but of
Christ. And ag^i^, that it is nothing but an instrument ordained by God, to
apply Christ's death unto our selves, Bell. de poenit. ^^^. 4. cap. 14.
and so to expiate the punishment of our sins instrumentally, and not
causally. To which I answer: First, that this inwrappeth another
contradiction: for, if it be Christ's in us, and not ours of our selves, then
it must needs be the satisfaction it self, and not an instrument to apply it:
for one and the same thing cannot be both the instrument to apply, and the
thing that is applied. But of this see more in the fourth reason. And secondly,
though it be from Christ, yet that is but in part; because, as they teach, it
is not only in every man's power, either to admit, or to exclude the grace of
God, and the efficacy of Christ's merit, by his own free will: but also, for
that it is wrought by our selves, and upon our selves, cooperating with grace
at least. And thus the knot of the contradiction remains still as fast tied
as ever it was.

48. Again, they say, that our satisfactions, when they ^2. Contrad. Bell. de
poenit. lib. 4. cap. 1.
are at the best, are imperfect, and no ways proportionable to the justice of
God: for when we sin, we offend him, who is an infinite God; and whatsoever
we have, it is but a small and finite thing: and therefore there must needs
be an imperfect compensation from us to God, depending rather upon his
merciful acceptance the^ any proportionable satisfaction. This is their
doctrine. And yet they teach also, that there is Idem de poenit. lib. 4. cap. 7.
an equality and proportion betwixt Gods justice, and our satisfactory works:
and that they are in some sort of infinite value, by reason of the infinite
power of Gods Spirit dwelling in us, from which they proceed. And thus by
their doctrine they are perfect, and not perfect: infinite, and finite: have
equality and proportion, and yet have no equality nor proportion to Gods
justice. Either therefore they are not of infinite value, though they proceed
from the Spirit: or if, because they do proceed from the Spirit, therefore
they are of infinite value, then they cannot be imperfect. Let them choose
which they will, they have a Wolf by the ears.

49. Further, they teach, that the passions of the Saints do 23. Contrad.
Bell. de Indulg. lib. 1. cap. 2.
not only profit themselves, but also others, whether living or dead; not so
much, by example, for their edification, as also, for their satisfaction, by
redeeming them from temporal punishment. Which doctrine is not only contrary
to Greg. de Valent. de Indulg. c. 1.
Saint Gregory, one of their own Bishops, who taught that Christ's sufferings
are herein distinguished from the sufferings Greg. Mag.
of all others; because he suffered without sin, and all men suffered with
sin: but also to the received doctrine in their Church, which holds, that
the righteousness by imputation, whereby we say a man is justified, is a mere
fiction and Chimericall conceit. For a man (say they) cannot be righteous by
another man's righteousness, nor wise by another man's wisdom: and so not
justified by Christ's righteousness imputed unto him. Cannot a man be justified
by Christ's righteousness imputed? and can satisfaction be made by the passions
of the Saints imputed? Is the death of Christ of less p^ice and force then the
sufferings of the Saints? The righteousness of Christ imputed, is a Monster in
Religion; and yet the satisfaction of the Saints imputed, is with them a
Catholic doctrine. And thus with one doctrine they establish imputation, and
with the other, pull it down again. With one breath they condemn it, and
with another they justify it.

50. Join unto Satisfactions, their bastard Purgatory: 24. Contrad.
for out of this doctrine, That men must satisfy in themselves, and for
themselves, for the temporal punishment of their sins, springs Purgatory:
because, when they have not satisfied sufficiently in this life, then (as they
teach) they must make up that which is wanting in the life to come, in the fire
Bell. de Pur at. lib. 1. cap. 7.
of Purgatory. This doctrine of Purgatory is directly opposite to their
Sacrament of Extreme unction: for there they teach, that by this Sacrament all
the relics of sin are utterly abolished and wiped away. Si quae delicta
sint adbuc expianda abstergit (says the Council of Trent:) If any sins
Council Trident. Sess. 14. ca. 2. Bell. de extrem. vnct. lib. 1. cap. 8
remain unpurged, or to be satisfied for, this Sacrament wypeth them clean
away. And the Council of Florence affirms, that the effect of this Sacrament
is, Sanatia animae: The healing of the soul. And Bellarmine concludes, that
therefore the five Senses are anointed, because they are, as it were, the five
doors, by which sins enter in unto the soul: to wit, that there might be a
general purgation of all sins which remain. This is their absolute
doctrine: and yet the same men affirm, that Purgatory is ordained to purge
away the Bell. de Pargat. lib. 1. cap. 7.
relics of sins, which in our life time we have not satisfied for: and
that many sins stick so fast and close unto us, that we carry them with us
out of this life, to be purged in that purging fire. This is also their
doctrine. Now I would ask of them, if all the relics of sin be wyped away by
this annoynting Sacrament, then what use is there of Purgatory? and if the
relics of sin be to be purged in Purgatory, then what use of this
Sacrament? Either therefore this fire does dry up the virtue of that
sacramental Oil, or this sacramental Oil does quench that fire. They will
say, peradventure, that either all are not anointed with this Oil ^ or that
some that are anointed, by their own infidelity and impenitency, bar out the
virtue thereof. Or, lastly, that the sin being remitted, yet the temporal
punishment due unto it, is to be paid in Purgatory. To which I reply: first,
that it is against the rule of their own Religion, that none that are anointed
with this Oil, should go to Purgatory: for then a very small number should
go to that place, seeing their Priests are so diligent, for their own belly
sake, that they seldom suffer any to pass away without this Pasport.
Secondly, for them which bar out the efficacy of the Sacrament by their own
infidelity or impenitency, not that purging fire of the Suburbs, but the
devouring fire of Hell it self is prepared, as they themselves acknowledge.
And thirdly, if there be not a purging away of some filthy stains of sins
from the soul by that fire, but only a satisfactory punishment, why do they
call it a Purgatory? Nay, and why does Bellarmine thus define it to be a
place, wherein, as it Bell. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 1. and lib. 2. cap. 1.
were in a Prison, after this life those souls are purged, which were not
sufficiently purged in this life; to the end, that being so purged, they may
enter into heaven, whither no polluted thing can have admittance? And thus it
remaynes a necessary conclusion, that either the relics of sin are not
cleansed away by Extreme unction, and so that Sacrament is of no force: or, if
they be, they are not then purged in Purgatory: and so that fire must needs be
quenched.

51. But if this Oil will not serve to extinguish Purgatory, 25. Contrad.
because the fire burns so hot: let us add unto this the Popes Pardons,
which will (at least) evacuate and empty it, that there shall be no fuel for
that fire. For they teach, that a Pardon or Indulgence, is the remission of
temporal punishment, due for actual sins, out of the dispensation of the
Churches Tollet. Instruct. Sacerdotum. lib. 6. cap. 21. Bell. de Indulg. lib.
1. Greg. de Valen. tom. 4. page 1846
Treasury. Thus does Tollet define it, and Bellarmine, and Gregory de Valentia,
adding only, that it is by means of application, of the superabounding
satisfaction of Christ and the Saints, made by him that has authority there
unto. Now none has authority thereunto but the Pope only, and such as are
delegated by him to that purpose: for the keys of this Treasury were committed
to Peter, and his Vicar, says Osorius, Osor. tom. 4. con. in publ. Iubil.
another Jesuit: and from them is derived to Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops,
and other inferior Clerks. And the Pope by his jurisdiction, may absolve all
that are in Purgatory Antonin. part. 3. ^it. 22. c. 5. ^. 6.
from the pain, and so empty Purgatory at once, says Antoninus, the
Archbishop of Florence: which if it be true, then either the Pope is
unmerciful, if he can, and will not: for who would suffer such a number of
poor souls to be so tormented, when with a word of his mouth he might
release them? or, if he would, and cannot, then their doctrine is false of his
absolute Jurisdiction. Let them choose whether they will. But of this, more
hereafter. Now to the purpose. Some of them hold, that the pains of Purgatory
hold but ten years: some, an hundred: some, two hundred: they that stretch
them farthest, yet say, that they must end at the day of Judgment: because
then, all must be Sheep or Goats, none betwixt both, of middle nature, as
Beliarmine affirms. Well, then, if Purgatory dure no longer, then we shall
not need to fear it no more, then that fire which the Philosopher calls,
Ignis fatuus. For let any man go to Venice, and say but a prayer of Saint
Augustine, printed in a table, and he shall have 82000. years pardon: that is
longer then the world is like to endure by their own confession, and therefore
longer then needs. This indulgence was granted by Pope Boniface the eyghth.
Or, if Venice be too far a journey, let him stay at home, and but nod the
head at the Name of Jesus, and he shall have twenty years pardon for every
time. I would nod twenty times a day if this were true, and that comes to
7300. in the year. O how a man may disappoint this Purgatory, if he have any
wit in his head! This Indulgence came from Pope John the two and twentieth. Or,
if this be also too great a matter, let a man wear but an Agnus Dei about his
neck, and think only in his heart on the Name of Jesus at the hour of his
death, and he shall have plenary forgiveness of all his sins. And for them
that are there already, they are helped out daily, or at least may be, by the
Suffrages and Masses of those that are alive: and if any remain there, the
fault is in the Priests, that say not Masses fast enough: and the reason of
that is, because they receive not money fast enough: for there is the common
Proverb most true, No penny, no pater noster. To conclude, ^ser. tom. 5. page
859.
in the year of Iubile a perfect and full p^rdou is granted to all that
desire the same, or on whom the Pope will bestow it: therefore the souls in
Purgatory cannot be excluded. Now Emanuel. Sa. in Aphoris. Barrad. in concord.
Euang. page 6^1.
if all these things stand true, then Purgatory must fall: for who would fall
into Purgatory, that may thus easily prevent it? or who would suffer any of his
friends souls and acquaintance to lie burning there one hour, when it is in
his power thus to redeem them? Either therefore the doctrine of Pardons is
false and feigned, or else Purgatory is no better then a scarcrow.

52. Add to these, that souls only are tormented in Purgatory, 26. Contrad.
Bell. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 9.
and not bodies: but bodies sin as well as souls: and some sins are
committed by the whole man, to wit, body and soul together: and therefore the
body is not free from the relics of sins, no more then the soul, especially
from obligation unto temporal punishment. How can then these relics be
purged away in this fire, when as the one part of man, which stands in need
of purging as well as the other, never comes thither? Bellarmine saw this
contradiction well enough, and therefore labors to salve it by a false
position, driving out one nail of error with another: to wit, That sin is
only an act of free will; Bell. Ibid.
and therefore, after the dissolution of the body and soul by death, remains
only in the soul, and not in the dead body. But this is first false: for
albeit properly it is the soul that sins, yet the body also sins, by
being an instrument of the soul in sinning: and he himself says, that some
sins cannot be committed but a toto composite, by the whole man. And if the
body do not sin as well as the soul, I wonder why it is punished both in
this life, with corporal diseases and plagues, and after death, with
putrefaction and deprivation of life, and in the day of judgment, with
eternal torment in hell fire. Secondly, if it were so, that a dead carcass
had no relic of sin in it, yet in that it was an instrument of sin, it is
liable to temporal punishment, which is the chief ground of Purgatory, as
has been showed. And therefore I conclude, that either the body goes to
Purgatory as well as the soul; or else a full satisfaction is not made for the
temporal punishment: or at least, that the fire of Purgatory is but an
imaginary and witty conceit to keep men in some awe, and to maintain their
own pride and pomp.

53. Next unto Purgatory, is Prayer for the dead, which 27. Contrad.
is both the mother and daughter of that fire; for as it is vpheld by
Purgatory, a weak and imaginary foundation; so it vpholdeth Purgatory, a paper
building: nevertheless it is ouerturned by it own poyse and weight. For this
they Bell. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 18.
teach, That the prayers and suffrages of the living, do nothing profit those
that do enjoy blessedness, as the Martyrs, and such like: according to that
of Saint Augustine, August de verbis Apostol. ser. 7.
Iniuriam facit martyri qui or at pro martyro: He does wrong a Martyr, that
prays for a Martyr: nor the damned, whether they be in the lowest Hell, as
reprobates, or in Lymbo, as unbaptized Infants: but only the souls in
Purgatory. And yet notwithstanding, they both allege the authorities of
ancient Fathers, to prove the prayer for the dead, who prayed for those whom
they assured themselves to be in heaven: and also by their own doctrine and
practice declare, that they have used to pray for the damned. As touching the
Fathers, Nazianzene prayed for Cesarius, and Ambrose for Nazian. in land.
Cesarii. Ambro. de obitu Theod and Valent. in August. confess. lib. 9. c. 13.
Theodosius, Valentinian and Saint Augustine for his mother. And in the ancient
Leiturgies of the Church, prayers were made for Patriarks, Prophets, Martyrs,
and the blessed Virgin Mary her self: yea, for the Popes also: as for Pope
Leo for example; and yet they thought all these to be in the state of
blessedness, as it appears in the same places where these prayers are
expressed: and therefore Cassander, their Cassand. consult. art. 24. Bell. de
Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 18.
judicious reconciler, calls those prayers, Testimonies of charity toward
the dead, congratulations of their present joys, and professions of their
faith and hope, concerning the immortality of their souls, and resurrection of
their bodies; not supplications for their releasement out of Purgatory, as our
Romanists imagine. Now hence thus we reason: If the Fathers prayed for them who
were in possession of blessedness, then their testimonies serve nothing for
their purpose, who affirm, that souls in Purgatory are only benefited by
such prayers: and if souls in Purgatory be only benefited by such prayers,
as they say, then they deal impertinently and deceitfully to bring in the
testimony of the Fathers for maintenance of such prayers; in the one, bewraying
the imbecillitie of their cause; in the other, the weakness of their
judgments, and in both crossing themselves in that which they would build up,
as the builders of Babel did. Neither does this only bewray their fraud in
misapplying the authorities of the Fathers: but also it implies a plain
contradiction: for they teach, that though we ought not to pray for the souls
of the Saints that are in heaven, yet we may pray for the resurrection and
glorification of their bodies, which notwithstanding are not tormented in
Purgatory, but asleep in their graves. And so it follows, that by their
doctrine we may not pray at all for the Saints departed, and yet we may pray
for their bodies, which are the one half of them. And again, we may not pray
for any that are dead, except they be in Purgatory; and yet we may pray for the
bodies of the dead, that are not in Purgatory, but in their graves.

54. If they reply as Bellarmine does, that we may pray for 28. Contrad. Bell.
de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 18.
the Saints in Heaven, not for releas of any pain, but for increase of their
glory, either of their souls presently, or of their bodies futurely at the
Resurrection: then (I say) they contradict themselves again. For, how do the
Prayers of the living do no good to any, but those that are in Purgatory;
whereas they are means to increase the glory of their souls, and to procure
the consummation of their bodies glory also? As for their practice in praying
for the damned, Damascene reports, that Gregory the Pope absolved Traiane,
Damas. in or at. de defunct.
and a Martyr Falcenilla from the pains of hell: and also relates out of the
history of Palladius, that Saint Maehary demanded of the dead skull of an
Idolater, whether the Prayers of the living did good unto them in Hell or not
to whom the skull should answer, When thou offerest up Prayers for the dead,
we in the mean time feel some refreshing. The like we read of Judas, in the
Legend of Saint Branden. Bellarmine indeed rejects this Tale of the skull as
a Fable, Bell. Ibid.
but yet he gain-saith not the delivery of Traiane, by the prayers of
Gregory. But Antoninus, the Archbishop of Florence, Antonin. part. 3. tit. 22.
c. 5.. 6. Aquia. in 4. did. 45. art. 2. q. 2.
approoueth the first as an authentical Story, so does Aquinas the last, and
frames this answer thereunto: that the souls of the damned receive no
mitigation of their pain by the Prayers of the living; but only a certain
vain and deceitful joy: and the School men devise strange reasons, how this
should be brought to pass, some saying that Traian, by the virtue of Gregory's
Prayers, returned to life, and did penance, and so obtained pardon, and glory:
others affirming that his soul was not simply absolved from the guilt of
punishment, but that his pain was suspended until the day of Judgment:
others imagining, that his soul was not freed from Hell, but from the torments
of Hell; so that he should remain there, but should feel no pain: And
lastly, Bernardine rejecting all these opinions, and concluding that Traian was
not definitiuely condemned, but conditionally, to wit, the divine Wisdom
foreseeing that Gregory should pray for him, and therefore to have deferred
his damnatorie sentence. Thus they labor in bypath that forsake the way of
Truth, and wander they know not whither. But to the point, either that is
false, that souls in Purgatory are only helped by the Prayers and Sacrifices
of the living, or this, that by them the damned may be either released or
refreshed.

55. Lastly, both the Doctrines of Purgatory and Prayer 29. Contrad.
for the dead, are directly crossed by their Canon of the Mass: for there
those dead persons for whom Prayer is made, are said to rest in Christ, and to
sleep the sleep of peace: and yet here they say, that none are to be prayed
and sacrificed for, but those only that are in Purgatory. What, is there then
any rest in Purgatory? is to be tormented restlessely in those burning flames,
which in their judgment are equal for extremity, and anguish (excepting
only continuance) to the pains of Hell, to be at rest, and to sleep in
peace? is Purgatory become a Paradise? and the skirts of Hell the suburbs of
Heaven? this is new and strange Doctrine: and yet this must needs be, if both
their practice of praying for the dead in their Mass, and their doctrine of
the same in their books be true.

56. Concerning invocation of Saints, it is entangled with 30. Contrad.
diverse absurd contrarieties: for first if it be true, which the former
Doctrine requires, that we must pray for the Saints which are in bliss, that
their glory may be increased: then Bell. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 18.
it is false that we must pray unto them. For if they stand in need of our
Prayers, as they do, if by them their glory is increased, then they should
pray unto us, as well as we unto them: and if they stand in need of our help
being in Heaven, how can they help us being on Earth? if we be Mediators for
them, how are they Mediators for us? True it is, that here below one man
prays for another, because they stand in need of one another: but by another
Doctrine which is also the truth, the Saints enjoy the sight and presence of
Idem de Sanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. 2.
God, and therefore are most blessed, for in him they enjoy all sinnesse of joy
and glory; so that nothing can be added to that happiness, which in their
souls they enjoy: and therefore one of these two necessarily are false, either
we must not pray unto them, or we need not pray for them.

57. Again, they a leage testimonies out of the old Testament, 31. Contrad.
to prove the invocation of Saints, as that Prayer of Moses, Remember, O Lord,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, thy Bell. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. 19. Ecchius Enchir.
cap. 14. 15. Coster. Enchir. cap. 14.
servants: and Ier. 25. If Moses and Samuel stand before me, my soul should
not be to this people: and Genesis 48. 16. and Job the 51. and 2. Machabees 15.
with diverse others: and yet they teach, that before Christ, there was no Saint
in Heaven, but all in Lymbo. Now, if they were in Lymbo, and could not help
themselves, until the Mediator came, how could they help others? and if they
did not enjoy the presence of God themselves, how could they be certified
thereby, as by a glass, of the necessities and Prayers of the living? so that
it must needs follow, that either the Saints were not prayed unto, or else if
they were, then they were in Heaven, and not in Lymbo. Especially, seeing
Bellarmine confesses, that the Saints in Lymbo Bell. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. 20.
did not ordinarily know the necessities of the living: that being a
prerogative of perfect blessedness: neither took care of humane affairs, nor
were protectors of the Church, as the Saints in Heaven are. Bellarmine indeed,
seeing this absurdity, acknowledges, that for the reasons before alleged, it
was not a custom in the old Testament to direct their Prayers purposely to
the Saints; but in their prayers to God, to allege the merits of the Saints:
but herein he both crosses himself, and all his fellows: for if it be so,
why does he and they produce testimonies out of the old Testament, to prove
their invocation which is made directly unto the Saints?

58. Lastly, they affirm that no Saints may be worshipped 32. Contrad.
publicly, that is, in the name of the Church, unless he be canonized by the
Pope, for the avoiding of misprision: Bell. Ibid. c. ^. and 10.
and yet they confess that none were canonized till 800. years after Christ,
by Pope Leo the third, and also that it is lawful privately to worship any of
whose sanctity I have an opinion: now I would gladly know, if this be a way to
avoid mistaking, why was it forborne so long? or why is it not urged privately
as well as publicly? if canonization were necessary 800. years after Christ,
to avoid mistaking, then there was much mistaking before, or else this remedy
would not have been hatched: and if it was necessary in the public service,
then is it much more in private devotions, seeing private men are more propense
to false suppositions, then a whole congregation is: and so this new doctrine
of canonization, not only condemns the Idolatry offormer times, in the
invocation of Saints, but also opens a wide door to private superstition, in
that kind: and so indeed crosses and undermines it self: for Bellarmine
confesses out of Sulpitius, that the people did long celebrate one for a
martyr, who after Bell. de Sanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. 7.
appeared, and told them that he was damned: and Alexander the third
reprehendeth certain men, for giving the honor of a martyr, to one that dyed
drunk: and no doubt but many such Saints are in their Martyrologe at this day,
notwithstanding their canonization: so that by canonizing, they prevent
mistaking, and by giving liberty to private invocation, they give occasion, if
not cause of mistaking: then which, what can be more contradictory?

59. Again, when they bar all children that are unbaptized, 33. Contrad.
out of Heaven, and confine them to Limbo, there to endure the punishment of
loss for ever: do they not contradict another doctrine of theirs, which
teaches, that men dying without the baptism of water, if they have baptismum
flaminis, vel sanguinis, that is, either suffer martyrdom for Christ's sake,
or, be regenerated by his Spirit, and so have a desire to be initiated by
that Sacrament, but are prevented by some means, may notwithstanding go to
Heaven: for if want of baptism be a sufficient cause to keep from Heaven,
then it is so as well in men grown, as in infants: and if it be not a
sufficient cause, to shut up Heaven gates against men of years, then how can
it be to young infants? especially, seeing infants by their doctrine, are equal
to men in two things: first, that they may be martyrs, as well as they: as the
children whom Herod slew in Bethl^em, are celebrated in their leiturgies: and
secondly, that they may be sanctified as well as they, as John Baptist was in
his mothers womb: and in these two are precedent unto them, first, that they
are void of actual transgressions, with which, men of years are infinitely
stained, and so nearer to Heaven, then those: and secondly, though they have no
desire of baptism in themselves, yet they are devoted thereunto, both by the
desire of their parents, and by the purpose and intent of the Church. And
therefore, all considerations, being equal in the persons, and the odds
remaining, if there be any on the infants side, it can be no less then a
direct contradiction, that children unbaptized cannot be saved, and men
unbaptized may be saved: for it implies thus much in effect, that the outward
baptism of water is necessary to salvation, and yet the outward baptism of
water is not necessary to salvation.

60. Again, concupiscence in the regenerate, is denied 34. Contrad. Bell. de
amiss. great. and stat. peccat. lib. 5. cap. 7. Council. Trident. Sess. 5.
by them all, to be in it own nature sin, and yet they all confess, that
it is malum, an evil, and vitium, a vice. Is any thing naturally evil, which
is not sin? or a vice in Philosophy, that is not a sin in divinity? This is
strange divinity. The name of evil, we know, is used of annoyances, crosses,
and afflictions; but these are natural evils, and not moral: but to do
evil, can be said of nothing, but sin: and howsoever ti be true, that vice
is rather the habit, then the act of sin: yet because it is the habit, is it
therefore less sinful then the act? noy, is it not more sinful, seeing it
grows out of many acts, and is confirmed by custom, and almost turned to
nature? In this therefore they are most contrary to themselves, when they grant
concupiscence to be of it own nature an evil, and a vice, and yet not a
sin: for nothing is naturally evil, but that which swarueth from good: nor
any thing vice, but that which is contrary to virtue. Now all moral good and
virtue is within the compass of the Law of God, and all moral evil and vice,
a transgression of that Law; therefore, it cannot but follow, that
concupiscence being a moral evil and vice, and therefore a transgression of
the Law of God, should be cleared from being sin, of it own nature,
especially, seeing as Origin says, This is the nature of Orig. in Romans 7.
sin, if any thing be done, which the Law forbids: and Bid, Beda in 1.
Ioh. Caesar. Dial. 3. apud Nanzianz.
that all that swarueth from the rule of righteousness, and sin: and
Caesarius Gregory, Naianzens brother, that sin is every assay to resist, and
every resistance it self against virtue. And Saint Augustine, that therefore a
thing is sin, because it ought not to August. ^e not. and great. cap. 14. and
contra Julian. lib. 4. cap. 3.
be done, and that to do any thing amiss, is to sin: but every moral
leuill and vice is forbidden by the Law, swarueth from the rule of
righteousness, is a resistance against virtue, and a thing that is done
amiss, and ought not to be done: therefore is also sin in it own nature.
They have no ways to help themselves out of these briers, but by the
distinction of properly and improperly, which they say, they fetch out of Saint
Augustine, as if concupiscence in the regenerat should be sin improperly, and
not properly, by which the contradiction is not taken away: for they say, that
it is not sin at all in it own nature, but only evil: now; if it be
improperly sin of it own nature, then it is some way sin: and so that
proposition is false, that it is not sin at all: and besides therefore it is
said by that distinction in Saint Augustine, to be improperly sin, because it
is not come to so high a perfection, as other sins are, by being without
consent of will: nevertheless, he never meant, but that it was a
transgression of the Law of God: and so a sin in it own nature: as may
appear by almost infinite places, in his books: as for instance one for all,
Concupiscence (says he) is not only the punishment Aug. contra Julian. lib.
5. c. 3.
of sin, and cause of sin, but even sin it self, because there is in it
a rebellion against the Law of the mind: and therefore he Idem de ci^itat.
lib. 1. cap. 25. and contra Julian. lib. 6. cap. 7. and de Joh. tract. 41. and
denupt. and concupisc. lib. 1. cap. 25.
calls it a concupiscentiall disobedience, which dwells in our dying
members: and in other places, an evil quality, vicious desires, unlawful
lusts, etc. Therefore Saint Augustine, when he called it ^in improperly, never
dreamt that is was not a transgression of the Law, but either that it was not
so high a degree of sin, as those which are done with consent of will: or
that because the guilt of it is taken away by baptism in the regenerate; as
he speaks in another place, Concupiscence Idem contra Julian. lib. 2.
is not called sin in such manner, as sin makes guilty, because the guilt
thereof is released in the Sacrament of regeneration. And thus this distinction
rightly understood, stands them in no stead, to keep their doctrine from
manifest contradiction.

61. This subject might be prosecuted in many more 35. Contrad.
points of their Religion, but I conclude with these two, Antichrist, and the
Bishop of Rome, which I join together in this discourse, because in truth they
are all one: and though they differ in name, yet they agree in nature: one egg
is not liker to another, nor milk liker to milk, then the Pope is to
Antichrist. As touching Antichrist therefore thus they confess, that by
mystical Babylon in the Revelation, is meant ` Rome, Bell. de Romans Pontif. l.
3. c. 13. Viega. sup. Apocal. 11. v. 12. Rhem. Annot. in Apocal. 17. 8. Ribera
com. in Apocal. 14.
and by and by with an other contrary blast, they puff away that again, and
affirm, that Rome is not Babylon. The first is avouched in plain terms, both
by Bellarmine, and Viega, and Ribera, two other Jesuits, and the whole
college of the Rhemists, and diverse others, convicted by the evidence of
truth: and the second is insinuated by a necessary consequence out of another
position: for they say, that Jerusalem shall be the seat of Antichrist: and in
so saying, they infer necessarily, that Jerusalem is mystical Babylon, and
not Rome, because the whore of Babylon is set forth in the Scripture, to be
the seat of Antichrist: and it must needs be so, seeing she is called the
mother of all fornications, that is, of Superstition and Idolatry, of all
Atheism and heresy: and seeing she makes drunk the kings and inhabitants
of the earth, with the golden cup of her fornication, and is died red, and made
drunk with the blood of the Saints, and of the martyrs of Jesus: And lastly,
seeing Antichrist must be one of the seven heads, to wit, the last of the
Roman beast, and the last King of the Roman Empire, though not called the
Roman Emperor, as Bell. de Romans Pontif. l. 3. c. 15.
Bellarmine himself confesses. All these things considered, and laid
together, it must needs be inferred by necessary consequence, that the whore
of Babylon cannot choose but be the seat of Antichrist; and if it be so, then
either Jerusalem is not the seat, where this man of sin must reign; or by
Babylon is not meant Rome, but Jerusalem: let them choose which: one of these
is apparently false.

62. Again, when by Babylon they understand Rome, they 36. Contrad.
restrain it to heathenish Rome, under the persecuting Emperors; and say,
that it is not meant of Rome Catholic and Christian, but of Rome Ethnic and
Heathenish. Now if Rome be Babylon, and Babylon the seat of Antichrist, as has
been Bell. de Romans Pontif. l. 3. c. 13.
proved out of their own confession, how can Rome heathenish, under the
Emperors, be it, when as they all agree, that Antichrist shall not come,
until a little before the end of the world? That state of Rome, which they
speak of, is past above a thousand years since, and Antichrist is not yet
come according to their doctrine. Necessarily therefore it follows, that
either Antichrist sat there then, and so is come long ago; or else that Rome
was not Babylon, whilst it was under the heathen Emperors, but is, or shall be
after it has received the Christian faith.

63. Again, the Roman Empire must be removed before 37. Contrad.
the coming of this great enemy: this, all our adversaries Idem l. 3. cap. 5.
yield unto: and most of the ancient fathers so interpret that place, When he
that hinders, shall be taken out of the ^. These. 2. 8.
way: and yet the state of the Roman Empire, under the Emperors, is made by
them the whore of Babylon, and the seat of Antichrist: and so the Roman Empire
by their doctrine, is both utterly abolished before the reign of Antichrist,
and yet is not abolished at all.

63. Again, they teach, that Enoch and Eli^^ must come 38. Contrad. Bell. de
Roman. Pontif. l. c. 6. and cap. 12.
and preach against Antichrist, and at length convert the Jews: and yet they
also affirm, that the Jews shall receive Antichrist for their Messiah. If the
Jews shall receive him for their Messiah, how shall they be converted by
Enoch and Elias to the true Messiah? And if they shall be converted, how do
they receive him for their Messiah? If they shall be converted before
Antichrists coming, and then fall away from Christ; then this could not be
done by Enoch and Elias, who, by their doctrine, must come in Antichrists time:
and yet it seems by them, they must be called before; because Bellarmine
confesses, that Antichrist must be an Apostate, and the head of the Apostasy:
but the Jews cannot make an Apostacy before they be called. Again, if they
shall be converted in Antichrists time, how shall Antichrist reign three
years and an half, when all his Subjects shall be taken from him? And lastly,
if they shall be called after the destruction of Antichrist, as indeed they
suppose, the^ how can that be, seeing Ibid. cap. 9.
the destruction of Antichrist shall not be but immediately before the end of
the world, even five and forty days, and no more? Shall a whole Nation be
converted in so short a time, and being converted, continue no longer, to make
profession and practice of their conversion? Thus one absurdity being granted,
a thousand follow.

64. Besides, they say, that Antichrist shall be borne of the 39. Contrad.
Ibid. cap. 12.
Tribe of Da^: and yet the Jews shall receive him for their Messiah. Whereas
notwithstanding it is a manifest and confessed thing that the Jews look for
their Messiah out of the Tribe of Judah, and not out of the Tribe of Dan. To
stop which g^p, they are driven to say, that indeed he shall truly rise out
of the Tribe of Dan, but shall feign himself to be of the Tribe of Judah, and
of the family of David. As if the Jews were so credulous to believe his
report without proof: or that they kept so slight an account of their
Genealogies, in which never any people were more scrupulous: or, as if a
distinction of their Tribes remained to this day, their Genealogies being
defaced so long since by Herod: and themselves scattered through all Countries
of the world. Either therefore he must be of the Tribe of Judah, in truth, more
then by a counterfeit simulation; or else the Jews will never receive him.

65. Lastly, they teach, that Jerusalem is to be the seat of 40. Contrad.
Antichrist, and the Jews his peculiar Subjects: and yet they also confess,
that he shall be the last Emperor of Rome, though not called by that name;
and therefore that the Romans shall be his Subjects. From whence I thus
conclude; that if the Roman Empire be the Dominion of Antichrist, then it is
not likely that he should be the expected Messiah of the Jews, nor that
Jerusalem should be his seat: for never any Roman Emperor kept his Imperial
residence in that City: and if the Jews be his Subjects, and Jerusalem the
seat of his Kingdom, then it cannot be that he should be the last Emperor
of Rome.

66. And thus much of Antichrist in general. Now of the 41. Contrad.
Bishop of Rome in particular; who, if he be not, as we constantly believe,
this very Antichrist; yet, (as Gregory their own Pope confesses) is his
forerunner, because he claims to himself the title of Universal Bishop.
Concerning the Pope, their presumption is, that he cannot err in any case, in
those things which pertain to faith, nor yet which concern manners, when he
teaches iudicially, and speaks out of his Chair: and yet they do not deny,
but that he may be an Heretic. This is confessed by most Popish Doctors:
Boz. to^^. 2. de ^ig. eccles. l. 28. cap. vlt. Fran. Victor. Relect. 4. nu. 6.
Occham. quaest. de Sum, Pontif. cap. 9. Bell. de Romans Pontif. lib. 4. c. 6.
as Bozius, who says, that he may be an Heretic, yea, write, teach, and
preach heresy. And Victoria, that in dispensing against the Decrees of
Councils, and former Popes, he may err and grievously sin. And Occham, that
many things are contained in the decretals, which savor of heresy. And it is
so faintly denied by Bellarmine, that his denial is almost as good as a
confession* for he says, that it is probable, and may godlily be believed,
that the Pope cannot be an Heretic. He does not resolutely avouch it, but
only coniecturally expend his opinion: but yet denies not, but that he may
err in some causes as a private man. And it is a Decree of their own, that
the Pope may be found negligent of his own and his brethrens salvation, and
draw innumerable people D. 4. Si Papa.
with him into hell. This gross and manifest contradiction they labor to
cover by a silly and ridiculous distinction: for thus they creep betwixt the
bark and the tree: The Pope may err as he is Man, but not as he is a Pope.
Orthus, He may err in his private opinions, but not e Cathedra, by way of
definition. Or thus, He may err when he instructs a particular Church: but
he cannot when he purposes to direct the Vniuersail Church. Or thus, He may
err in the premises, but not in the conclusion. But this is a senseless and
ridiculous shift. For first, if he may write, teach, and preach, and decree
heresy, as out of Occham and Bozius: and err in his Dispensations, as out of
Victoria, then he may err iudicially, and e Cathedra; for these are judicial
exercises of the Chair. Secondly, if the Pope may be an Heretic, as he is a
Man, and have a sound says, as he is a Pope; then as he is a Man, he may go
to hell, and as he is a Pope, to heaven: but both mu^^ go to heaven or to hell
together; therefore both of them either err or not err together: and if he
err in his own private judgment, how can he but err in his public
determinations, which are but fruits of his judgment; especially, seeing the
maine promise whereupon this infallibil^^ie of the Popes Chair is grounded,
was made not only to the Office, but also to the person of Peter? Luke 22. 32.
I have prayed for thee that thy faith may not fail: as Bellarmine himself
confesses, and Augustine, Chrysostom, Bell. de Romans Pontif. lib. 4. c. 3 Aug.
de correp. and great. cap. 8* Chrysostom. hom. 83. in Mat. Theophil. in cap. 22. bic.
Theophilact, and others of the Fathers expound it as a personal privilege,
without any mention of his Office: nevertheless, let it belong to his Office,
if that will do them any good: then I say, What reason is there, that the
privilege of Peter's person should not be derived to the Pope, as well as his
Office, seeing they cl^ime the latter by the same title, by which Peter had the
former? and if Peter's faith could not fail, neither in himself, nor in his
Office, by virtue of that promise; then the Pope, if he be Peter's successor,
must be in the same case, that is, neither to err personally nor iudicially:
or if he err one way, then also to be subject to error the other. Lastly,
experience has taught, that Popes may err, even as they are Popes, and that
iudicially: yea, and also have been condemned for Heretics: As Honorius the
first, whom three general Councils condemned for a Me^othel^te. And John the
two and twentieth, who was constrained to recant his judgment touching the
soul, by the University of Paris. And John the three and twentieth, who was
condemned for an Heretic, by the Council of Constance, Eras. annot. in 1. Cor.
7.
for denying the immortality of the soul. And diverse others, who not only in
their private opinions, but in their public doctrines, have taught and
maintained notorious errors.

67. Another doctrine of theirs is, that the Pope is the 42. Contrad.
head of the Church, and yet they deny not, but sometimes the Pope is no true
nor sound member of the Church: how can he be the head of the Church, that is
no sound member thereof? nay, no member at all, not so much as the tail, as
the Jewish Rabbines call the Bishop of Rome, in disdain: except their last
distinction help them, quatenus Papa, and quatenus homo, I know not how they
will rid themselves out of this snare; and yet that will not help them,
neither in this case: for is it likely, that Christ will make a reprobate, the
head of his Church, and commit the cu^^^dy of the same to an Atheist, an
Heretic, or an Epicure, or a Necromancer, or a monster of nature, as all
stories ^all John 12. and as many of them have been? Surely either as he is a
Pope, he is not the Churches head: or as he is a man, he must needs be a
member of the same. If they say, that we give unto a King the same title of
head and governor of the Church, who notwithstanding is often a tyrant, and
waster of the Church, and a very reprobate: I answer, that in attributing
these titles of dignity to Kings, we do not positiuely set down what every
one is: for if he be a destroyer of the Church, he is not an vpholder of it;
but what every one ought to be in regard of his office: but the Romanists
absolutely set it down, that though the Pope be a wolf, wasting the flock of
Christ, and though he lead by his doctrine and example, infinite souls with
him to hell, yet he is still actually the head of the Church, quatenus Papa,
and no man may say unto him, Why do you so?

68. Again, it was decreed by two Councils, and those 43. Contrad.
assembled, authorized, and confirmed by Popes themselves, that the Council
was above the Pope; and yet the Council Council. Constant. and Basil. Bell. de
Council. lib. 2. cap. 17.
of Laterane, under Pope Leo the tenth, decrees peremptorily, that the Pope is
above all Councils: and so also most of the modern Romanists affirm. Now if
the decrees of Councils lawfully assembled, and approved by Popes, be the
doctrines of the Church, then here is one doctrine quite contrary to another,
one Council opposite to another, yea, one Pope to another: which is no new nor
strange thing, but ordinary in the Church of Rome. As witness, Pope John the
two and twentieth, and Pope Nicholas, about the question of our Saviors manner
of possessing earthly goods: and Pope Celestine, and Pope Innocent the third,
in the question of divorce, in the case of heresy: and Pope Pelagius, and Pope
Gregory the first, in the question of putting away the wives of Subdeacons; one
of these crossing the other iudicially, and one gain saying, what the other
defended. And most notorious is that which diverse Chronologers testify of Pope
Stephen Sigebert. Polonus. Sigonius de reb. Ital. lib. 6. Lui^prand. ver. per
Europ. gest* lib. 1. cap. 8. Council. Reuen. anno Dom. 898.
the sixth, how he decreed in a Council, that they who were ordained Bishops
by Pope For^^sus, his predecessor, were not ordained lawfully, because the man
was wicked, by whom they were ordained; and therefore he did vnordain them, and
reordaine them again: thus Stephen iudicially crossed Form^sus, and he again
was crossed and condemned by Pope John the ninth, even for this fact, and his
new ordainings marched with new baptizings.

69. Lastly, they constantly maintain, that the Pope is 44. Contrad.
not Antichrist; and yet they affirm that he is the Vicar of Christ here on
earth: a flat contradiction: for the word Antichrist signifies not only an
enemy unto Christ, but also one that takes upon him the office and authority
of Christ: the pr^position (...), affording naturally, and properly, both
significations, as appears in these two words (...), an opposite, and (...),
a Proconsull: in the first whereof it signifies opposition, and the second
substitution. Now then, if the Pope be Christ's Vicar general on earth, then
he is in the last sense Antichrist: and being so in the last sense, it is most
likely that he is also the same in the first: because the Antichrist spoken of
in the Scripture, is described to be such a one as is not an open and outward,
but a covert and disguised enemy, having two horns like the Lamb, that is,
counterfeting the humility and meekness of Christ, and making a Apoc. 13. and
17.
glorious profession of religion, with a show of counterfeit holiness, when
notwithstanding he speaks lies in hypocrisy, and utters words like the
dragon, and is the greatest enemy to Christ Jesus and his Gospel that ever was:
so that in that he is Christ's Vicar, he is Antichrist, by their own
confession, in that sense, and being so, is probably Antichrist also in the
other: because the true Antichrist must be both the one and the other. And so
for the conclusion of this point, we have not only the mystery of iniquity,
that is, Antichristianisme in the manifold contradictions and oppositions
thereof, but even Antichrist himself lurking in his den, professing himself
and his followers to be the only true Church of God, and pretending himself
to be the Prince of the covenant, as Saint Jerome speaks, that is as much as
to say, the Vicar of Christ: and without doubt, as the sweet harmony in
Christian Religion, and every part thereof with it self, is a pregnant
argument of the infallible truth thereof: so the miserable opposition and
contrariety in the Religion of the Church of Rome, and that most of the
doctrines therein contained, either with themselves, or with other, as I have
in part here showed, leaving a fuller demonstration thereof to some other that
shall more deeply search into them, do evidently euince, that it is the
Religion of Antichrist; and therefore not only to be suspected, but even to
be abhorred of all them that love the truth, or that desire the salvation of
their souls.

The IX. MOTIVE. That Religion, whose doctrines are in many points apparently
opposite to the word of God and the doctrine of the Gospel cannot be the
truth: but such is the Religion of the Church of Rome, ergo etc.
1 IN the Chapter going before, I have showed how the Romish Religion is
contrary to it self, that is, falsehood to falsehood: now in this, my task is
to demonstrate, how it crosses the word of God, that is, falsehood to truth;
which being proved, I hope, no man which is not drunk with the poisonous cup
of the whore of Babylons fornication, will doubt of the vanity and falsehood
thereof. Now my purpose is not to enter into the lists of disputation, and
confute their opinions by strength of argument, (that combat has been
valiantly performed by many of our Champions:) only my intent is, first to
show how their doctrines co^tradict the plain text of Gods word, and secondly,
to wipe away their subtle and intricate distinctions, whereby they labor to
make a reconciliation betwixt the word of God, and their opinions; which shall
be my only task in this Chapter: for it is to be noted, that there was never
any generation so happy, or rather so miserable in distinctions, as the
Romanists are: they maintain their kingdoms by distinctions, by them they
blind the eyes of the simple, dazzle the understanding of the unadvised, set a
gloss upon their counterfeit ware, cover the deformity of their Apostate
Church; and lastly, extinguish the truth, or at leastwise, so darken and
obscure it, that it cannot shine so brightly as it would: but in seeking to
extinguish the light of truth, they distinguish themselves from the truth: and
as Jacob by his party-colored sticks, occasioned a brood of party-colored
sheep and goats: so they, by their fond distinctions, bring forth a
party-colored and counterfeit Religion: as I trust to lay open to the world,
in this discourse following.

2. The mayor or first proposition being without all controversy* I pass
over in silence, and come to the minor or second Minor.
proposition, which is, that the Religion of the Church of Rome in many
doctrines is apparently opposite to the word of God.

3. The Gospel teaches, that (...) one only God is to be 1. Mat. 4. 10. Mat
6. 9. 1. Pet. 5. 7. Psalm. 50. 15. Ier. 17. 5, 7.
inuocated and worshipped, and that after that manner which he has appointed
in his word, and that all the confidence of our salvation is to be placed in
him alone: but the Romanists command not only to invoke God, but also Angels
and Saints departed, and in time of danger to expect help and succor from
them, and to repose our trust and confidence in them also.

4. Bellarmine distinguishes and says, that God alone indeed Bell. de Roman.
Pontif. l. 3. c. 23.
is to be worshipped, and inuocated with that kind of adoration, which is due
only unto God: but yet the excellent creatures may be honored, and some of

5. But these distinctions cannot extinguish the truth: for first they give by
name the highest worship that can be, to wit, Latria, to the Image and
relics of Christ and the cross, and to a piece of bread in the Sacrament,
insomuch that Gregory de Valentia, a famous Jesuit, and Bellarmines compeere,
is in this regard driven to say, that some kind of Idolatry is lawful.
Secondly, if they should deny this, yet their doctrine and practice does
apparently proclaim as much: for when they say to their Agnus deis, It breaks
and quasheth all sin as Christ's blood, do they not equal them to Christ?
when they place their hope and confidence in Saints and relics, do they not
equal them to God? when they pray, that by the merit of a golden, silver, or
wooden cross, they may be freed from sin committed, do they not equal it
with our Savior that dyed on the cross? when they desire at the Saints hands
grace and glory, do they not equal them to the God of grace, and glory? when
they call the blessed Virgin the Queen of Heaven, and give unto her one half
of Gods kingdom, even the half of mercy, do they not equal her to her
maker? Lastly, when they offer sacrifice to relics and Missal. Romans tit.
derit. seruand. in celebr. miss.
Images, as namely, burn frankincense, set up tapers, offer the calves of
their lips, do they not equal them to God? for all these duties are proper
and peculiar parts of Gods service; and therefore in attributing them to
creatures, they give unto them plainly that service and worship, which
belongs to God alone.

6. The Gospel teaches, that remission of sins, and everlasting 2. Esaias 63.

life, is bestowed upon us freely, not for any works or merits sake of our
own, but for Jesus Christ's sake, the only begotten Son of God, who was
crucified for our sins, and rose again for our justification: But the
Romanists teach, that we are justified and saved, not by Christ's merits only,
but in part for Christ's sake, and in part for our own contrition, obedience,
and good works.

7. Bellarmine answers, that their doctrine is falsely charged, to say that
sinners are justified, partly for their own works sake, and partly by Christ:
for (says he) by a distinction there be three kind of works; one, of those
that are performed by the strength of nature only, without faith and the grace
of God: another, of such as proceed from faith and grace, but not from a man
fully justified: and therefore are called works of Preparation; as Prayer,
Alms, Fasting, Sorrow for sin, and such like: and the third, of such which
are done by a man justified, and proceed from the Spirit of God dwelling in
his heart, and sheading abroad charity in the same. Now concerning the first,
he acknowledges that we are not justified by them, by the example of Abraham,
Romans 4. and therefore that they most impudently belie their doctrine, that
fasten this opinion upon them. As touching the second, he says, that these
works Preparatiue are not meritorious of reconciliation and justification by
condignity and justice: yet in as much as they proceed from faith and grace,
they merit after a sort; that is, obtain remission of sins. The third sort
of works he boldly and confidently affirms, to merit not remission of
sins, because that was obtained before: but everlasting glory and happiness,
and that truly and properly.

8. This Bellarminian distinction may be distinguished by Answer.
two essential qualities: first, Folly; secondly, Falsehood. Folly: for it
makes nothing to the taking away of the Antithesis before mentioned: for when
as he confesses, that the second kind of works do merit remission of sins
after a sort, and the third eternal life absolutely, what does ^e but
acknowledge that which we charge them withal, and which himself rejected a
little before as a slander? namely, that we are justified and saved partly by
our own merits, and partly by the merits of Christ: for the Gospel says, We
are saved by Christ's merits alone: and he says, We are saved by our own
merits also. And thus the folly and vanity of his distinction evidently
appears.

9. The falsehood shows it self in two things: first, in that he affirms,
that they do not teach, that works done before grace do merit any thing at
Gods hand: for though it be a Canon of the Council of Trent, charged with an
Anathema, Council. Trident. ^ess. 6. can. 1.
If any man should say, that a man may be justified by his own works, wrought
by the power of nature, without the divine help by Christ Jesus: and
Bellarmine seems to affirm as much in this place. Yet Andradius, that famous
Interpreter of that forenamed Council, one of the most learned men of his age,
and that knew well the mysteries of that Council, does tell us, that by divine
help the Council understood not the grace of regeneration, and special work
of Gods sanctifying Spirit, but heroical motions, stirred up in the
unregenerate and unbelievers: and that by this special help they might do
works void of all fault, and meritorious of salvation. And Bellarmine
confesses in other places, Bell. de Iustif. lib. 4. cap. 20. Salmer. t^^. 5.
page 41. Council Trid. Sess 6. can. 7.
that they are good, suogenere: that is, morally: and Salmeron the Jesuit,
that they dispose and prepare a man for justification: and the same Council of
Trent in the seventh Canon following, does curse them that shall say they are
sins, or that they deserve the hatred of God. Now if these kind of works be
good in their kind, and preparatiues to justification, and not sins, nor
deserving the hatred of God, but such as whereby the Heathen were saved; then
it is a probable falsehood in Bellarmine, when he says by their doctrine, that
these works do not justify, nor help any thing to the justification of a
sinner.

10. Secondly, it is false also which he affirms, concerning the second kind
of works: to wit, of preparation, that though they proceed from faith and
grace, yet they do not justify: for Bellarmine in another place does not
stick to Bell. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 13. Idem. cap. 17.
say, that this faith justifies by way of merit, and deserves forgiveness of
sins after a certain manner: and here in this place, that these works
proceeding from faith, do merit after their manner, and obtain remission of
sins; which if it be true, then it must needs be false which he said before,
That they make not our works to concur with the merits of Christ, for the
remission of sins, which is the point of opposition: and that which also he
affirms here, That these works do not justify, seeing remission of sins
is of the very essence of justification: for none have their sins forgiven,
but they are justified; and none are justified, but they have their sins
forgiven: they concur in one, if they be not one and the same: And therefore
if these works merit remission of sins, they must needs also merit
justification. And thus Bellarmines distinction does no ways free their
doctrine from opposition to the doctrine of the Gospel.

11. The Gospel teaches, that he which repents and 3. Mark. 1. 15. Ephesians.
3. 12. Heb. 4. 16. Heb. 10. 19, 22. Mat. 9. 3. Mat. 9. 22. Ioh. 16. 33. Romans 8.
15. 1. Ioh. 3. 14. Chytraus. com in Revel. cap. 9.
hears the promise, ought to believe it, and be persuaded, that not only
other men's sins, but even his own are pardoned for Christ's sake, and that he
does please God, and is accepted of God, and in this faith ought to come unto
God by prayer. But the Church of Rome teaches, that a man must always doubt
of the remission of his sins, and never be assured thereof; which doubting (as
Chytraeus truly speaks) is plainly repugnant to the nature of faith, and a
mere heathenish doctrine.

12. Bellarmine answers here not by a distinction, but by a negation, denying
flatly that the Scripture teaches any such doctrine, that a man may be assured
of the remission of his sins, and his reconciliation with God: and this he
seems to prove by two arguments; one, because it is contrary Eccles. 9.
to other plain and manifest places of Scripture: another, because all Gods
promises almost have a condition annexed unto them, which no man can justly
know whether he has fulfilled or no.

13. It is good for Bellarmine here to use a plain negation: Answer.
for their doctrine is so manifest, that it will admit no distinction: the
Council of Trent has put that out of all question Council. Trident. Sess. 6.
cap. 9.
and distinction. For it teaches in express words, that no man ought to
persuade and assure himself of the remission of his sins, and of his
justification; no though he be truly justified, and his sins be truly and
really pardoned. This doctrine is so evident, that Bellarmine could neither
distinguish, as his custom is, nor yet deny it; and therefore he freely
confesses it: and yet Gropper condemned it as an impious doctrine: Gropper.
Catharin. assert. and Apolog. Domin. Sot^. Apol. cap. 2.
and Catharinus, at the Council of Trent, defended the contrary, that the
child of God, by the certainty of faith, knows himself to be in the state
of grace. And so did also Dominicus a Sot^, and diverse others of their own
stamp But there is great cause why the Church of Rome should maintain this
doctrine of doubting very peremptorily: for as Chemnitius Chemnit. exam. pars
1. page 183.
well observes, all the Market of Romish superstitious wares is built upon
this foundation: for when as the conscience, being taught to doubt of solution,
does seek for some true and sound comfort, and not finding the same in faith,
through the merits of Christ, then it flies to it own works, and heapeth up
together a bundle of superstitious observations, by which it hops to obtain
favor at Gods hands: hence arise voluntary vows, Pilgrimages, Inuocations of
Saints, works of Supererogation, private Masses, sale of Pardons, and a number
such like trash: and when as yet they could not find any sound comfort in any
of these, at last was Purgatory found out, and redemption of the souls of the
dead out of that place of torment, by the suffrages and prayers of the living.
Now the Romanists, fearing lest these profitable and gainefull wares, whereby
an infinite tribute is brought into their coffers, should be bereft them, have
barred out of their Church this doctrine of certainty of salvation by faith, of
which if men's consciences be once persuaded, they will never repose any more
confidence in those superstitious trumperies.

14. But we, with Luther, may boldly say, that so odious Luther in Genesis cap. 41.
and impious is this doctrine, that if there were no other error in the Roman
Church but this, we had just cause of separation from them: and with Chytraeus,
that it is repugnant to the nature of faith, and a mere heathenish doctrine.
For it does not only nourish men's infirmities, who are too much pro^e to
doubting, but even encourage them thereunto, and teach that we ought to doubt.
But that we may come to the point, is not this indeed the doctrine of the
Gospel, that we should not doubt of our salvation? why then does our Savior
command all to repent, and believe the Gospel? By Mat. 1. 15.
which he plainly teaches, where true repentance goes before, there belief
in the Gospel, that is, assurance of forgiveness of sins by the blood of
Christ, does follow: and that we ought every one to be thus assured, seeing
this is a precept Evangelical, which does not only give charge of doing the
thing commanded, as the Law does; but also inspireth grace and power to effect
it: as Saint Augustine well Aug. de Spiritis and liter.
informs us, when he says, The Law was given, that grace might be sought;
and grace was given, that the Law might be fulfilled. Why does Saint Paul
say, that the Spirit of God Romans 8. 15.
witnesses unto our spirits that we are the sons of God? Neither is this
witness of the Spirit a doubtful and uncertain certificate: for Saint Paul,
in the words going before, calls it, the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
Abba, Father, and not the spirit of bondage, to fear any more. When therefore
God does shead abroad his Spirit into our hearts, crying, and making us to cry,
Abba, Father, in faithful, not formal prayer, that is a certain testimony to
our spirits, that we are the sons of God. For as Saint Jerome Hierom. in Gal.
cap. 4.
well notes, We never durst call God, our Father, but upon conscience of the
Spirit dwelling in us. Neither do we ever upon this ground call God, our
Father, but withal we are, or ought to be persuaded that we are his children.

15. Again, why does he say in another place, that all they which believe the
Gospel, are sealed with the holy Spirit of promise? Are Gods children sealed?
and can they not Ephesians. 1. 13.
see nor know the Seal? Is not this one use of a seal, to confirm a
covenant, assuring the certainty of the performance thereof to him to whom it
is made? Yea, does not Saint John say, Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and
he in us; because Ioh. 4. 13.
he has given us of his Spirit? And again, does not the holy Ghost so ascribe
this knowledge of justification and salvation on to a man's self, that he
denies it to all others? To him that overcomes, I will give a white stone,
and in the stone a new Revel. ^. 17.
name written, which no man knows sa^^ he that receives it. What is this
white stone, but the absolution and remission of a sinner? what is the new name
written in it, but the child of God? This no man knows, but he that has it;
therefore he that has it, knows it. What can be more plain? And yet this is
the exposition almost of all Divines upon that place. To omit all other
testimonies, does not the Scripture now teach this doctrine, touching the
certainty of salvation?

16. I but, says Bellarmine, all Gods promises, for the most part, are
conditional, and no man can certainly know whether he has performed the
condition; and therefore cannot assure himself of the promise. To which I
answer, that albeit, in regard of our infirmity, we are not able to fulfill
the conditions required in Gods promises: yet we are assured that we shall
fulfill them, through him that strengthens us: and so, as the Apostle Paul
said in one place, We can do nothing, no, not so much as think a good
thought. Yet in another 2. Cor. 3. 5.
place he says, I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me. So
may we say of our selves, We cannot do Phil. 4. 13.
anything of our selves: yet in Christ Jesus we can do all things: By his
might we can keep his Commandments; though not perfectly, yet so, as our
defects are made up by his perfection, and our endeavors accepted in his
mediation: for his sake it is given unto us, not only to believe in him, but
also to suffer for him: and by his neuer-fayling Phil. 1. 29.
grace, and everlasting love, we are assured that we shall persevere unto the
end. And therefore Origin says, that it is Phil. 1. 6. Orig. in Ierem. hom. 1.
impossible that that which God has once quickened should either by himself or
any other be killed. Thus there is no condition required of the children of
God; but they are assured that they can perform it, though not in full
measure, and by their own strength, yet in that measure which God will accept,
and by the strength of his Spirit which dwells in them, and sanctifies them
to do his will. And thus this third Antithesis is nothing empeached by
Bellarmines cavil.

17. The Gospel tells us, that there is but one only propitiatory 4 Heb. 9.
25. 28. Heb. 10. 12. 14.
Sacrifice in the world, which is Christ Jesus the Savior of the world, who
offered up himself once, and no more, for to take away the sins of his
people. But the Council. Trident. Sess. 6. cap. 2. can. 1. 2. 3. 4.
Church of Rome teaches, that every Mass is a propitiatory Sacrifice for the
quick and the dead: and that every Priest, as often as he says Mass, does
offer up Christ unto God the Father, as a Sacrifice for sin.

18. Bellarmine here distinguishes again, and says, that Bell. de Romans
Pontif. l. 3. 6. 23.
indeed there is but one only propitiatory Sacrifice in the world, to wit,
that which was once offered upon the Cross; but yet that one Sacrifice may be
reiterated in mystery by the same high Priest Christ Jesus, by the hands of a
carnal Priest. And again, he in another place distinguishes this Sacrifice
Idem. de missa. lib. 1. cap. 25.
into bloody and unbloody, and says, that there was but one bloody Sacrifice
of Christ, and that on the Altar of the Cross: but there are many unbloody
sacrifices of the same Christ in their daily Masses. And lastly, that the
sacrifice of the Mass is but an application of the Sacrifice of the Cross
unto men's souls, for the actual remission of sins purchased by Christ upon
the Cross.

19. Here is much ado to little purpose, three distinctions, Answer.
and all not worth a rush: for all of them are mutually contrary to each
others, and vain, and frivolous in themselves: first, if the sacrifice of the
Mass be a repetition of the sacrifice of the cross, then it is not an
application of it: for it is one thing to reiterate, and another to apply: and
therefore if the Priest does reiterate it, then he does not apply it: and if
he does apply it, then he does not reiterate: for to reiterate, is to do
again that which was done before, and to apply, is to make use of that which
was done, but not to do it again. Beside, if the mass be a repetition, and
application of the sacrifice of the cross, then how is it an unbloody
sacrifice? can that bloody sacrifice be repeated and applied after an unbloody
manner? that is as much as to say, it is a sacrifice, and yet not a sacrifice,
especially no propitiatory sacrifice: seeing as the Apostle Heb. 10.
speaks, without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
Again, if the mass be a repetition of that bloody sacrifice of Christ on the
cross, then it is a repetition of Christ's death, and a crucifying of him
again; for the sacrifice of Christ, and the death of Christ is all one: and if
it be so, then it must needs be bloody as well as that: for the repetition of a
thing, is the doing of the same thing again. And lastly, if it be an
application of it, then it cannot be a repetition of it: nor indeed the same
in specie with it; for the application of a thing, is not the thing it self in
any reason: and thus these distinctions are at civil war with each other:
and indeed like deadly enemies do cut each others throats.

20. But let one of their own learned masters, Peter Lumbard, Lumbard. lib. 4.
o^st. 12.
conclude this point for us; who says that Christ dying upon the cross,
offered himself, and is sacrificed daily in the Sacrament, because in this
Sacrament there is a co^memoration of that sacrifice of the cross which was
once offered: this he spoke, convicted by the truth. And the Council of Trent
also in another place Council. Trident. ^ess. 22. v. cap. 1.
does almost, if not fully speak as much, when it says, that Jesus Christ left
to his Church a sacrifice, by which that bloody sacrifice which he made upon
the cross, might be represented, and the memory thereof continued: which if
it be true, then being convicted by their own consciences, and confessions, it
remains, that that doctrine which holds that the mass is a true, real,
propitiatory sacrifice, is opposite to the doctrine of the Gospel, which
teaches the contrary: and so this fourth Antithesis is safe and sound, for all
that Bellarmine can say against it.

21. The Gospel teaches, that both parts of the Sacrament are to be
ministered to all Christians; and of the cup it says expressly, Drink ye all of
this: but the Church of Rome has decreed, that none should drink of the cup,
but the Council. Trident. Sess. 5. cap. 1. and 3.
Clergy, and that the people should content themselves with the other part of
the Sacrament.

22. Bellarmine distinguishes of the word (All) and says, Bell. de Romans
Pontif. l. 3. c. 23.
By it is not to be understood all the faithful, but the Apostles only; which
he proves by Saint Mark, who says, that they drank all of it, that is,
all the Apostles which sat at table with our Savior Christ, and not all the
Christians that believed in him.

23. But to his distinction, (not all Christians, but all Apostles) Answer.

l. 6. Lorichius de pub missa. G. ossa. Cassand. Consult. art. 22.
I answer, that this is Bellarmines conceit, or rather deceit; and he
borrowed it of Andradius the famous expositer of the Council of Trent: but it
is a miserable gloss (woe be to it) that so soully corrupts the text: first,
the fathers understood by the universal All, all the faithful; and that the
Apostles here in this great action, were not Pastors, but sheep, Christ
himself the great shepherd, being the distributer and diuider of this
Sacrament. I shall not need to repeat their words, they are so evident and
ordinary. Let the margent direct the Reader to them, if they desire
satisfaction in this point.

24. Secondly, many of their own Doctors so interpret it, as Thomas Aquinas,
Durand, Biel, Alphonsus de Castro, Lorichius, the author of the gloss, and
diverse others. Cassanders testimony shall stand in stead of all the rest: he
says plainly, that the Western Church believed for a thousand years, that
our Savior Christ gave this Sacrament to his disciples, representing the
persons of all the faithful: and he adds reasons, why the wine as well as
the bread was to be received; both for a more full representation of the
passion of Christ* and signification of our full spiritual nourishment in
Christ, and also the full and perfect redemption of our bodies and souls, by
the body and soul of our Savior. This Cassander repeats to have been the
opinion of the Latin and Greek Church, for the space of a thousand years.
What an vpstart distinction then is this of Bellarmine, who notwithstanding
cease not to brag that they have all antiquity on their side?

25. Thirdly, we have Saint ` Paul thus interpreting the words of his Lord and
Master, who spoke nothing but by the direction of the Spirit: for whereas our
Savior says, Drink ye all of it, Saint Paul says, Let a man examine
himself, 1. Cro. 11.
and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup. But all must examine
themselves before they come to the sacrament: therefore, all are enjoined to
drink of the Sacramental cup: let us choose then whom we will believe,
whether Saint Paul or Bellarmine: for Saint Paul interprets this All one way,
and Bellarmine clean contrary.

26. Lastly, reason it self disapprooueth this exposition: for first I would
ask him, whether that which our Savior commanded to be done at his last
Supper, were to be done once and no more, or often, even to the end of the
world? If he say once, and no more, the words will confute him which say, Do
this in remembrance of me: if often, then by All, he meant not the Apostles
only; for the Apostles lived not till the end of the world. Again, if by All
was intended the Priests only, then not only the people should be excluded
from the cup, but from the bread also: for if in these words, Drink ye all of
it, he speaks to Priests only, then in these words, Eat ye all of it, he
speaks to none but Priests: for they are both spoken to one and the same
persons. And thus the people should have no part of the Sacrament at all: for
the same All that is in one, is in the other. And to conclude, if the Apostles
stood here in stead of Pastors or Priests, why did they not minister the
Sacrament? It is the part of a Priest, as he is a Priest, to minister the
Sacrament to others, and when he receives it himself, then he stands for
a common Christian, and not for a Priest, for a sheep, not for a shepherd.
But they did not minister, but receive; therefore they stood not here for
Priests, but for the whole body of the faithful. And thus this distinction
being battered by the testimony of fathers, confession of their own Doctors,
authority of Saint Paul, and strength of reason, does fall to the ground like
Babel: and this fifth Antithesis is nothing weakened by Bellarmines Sophistry.

27. The Gospel teaches, that true repentance, or conversion 6 Luke 24. 47.
Act. 26. 18. Mark. 1. 15.
to God, is an earnest sorrow of heart for sins committed, and faith
persuading that they are certainly remitted for Christ's sake. But the Church
of Rome teaches, that contrition indeed is one of the parts of repentance: but
they feign that it meriteth a remission of sins, and to it they add
auricular confession not commanded by God, and satisfaction, or voluntary
works, by which they say, that the punishments of sin are satisfied, and
that these also may be redeemed by money and purse-penance. All which whole
doctrine is very blasphemous against the merit of the Son of God, who only
made satisfaction for our sins.

28. Bellarmine here from distinguishing, falls to railing, and accuses us
of manifest lying and falsehood, in laying that to our charge which we are not
guilty of: but whether is the liar he, or we, let the Reader judge. First
therefore, that true repentance is not a bare sorrow of heart for sin, but such
a sorrow, as is joined with, and arises from faith, appears by this, because
contrition without faith, leads to desperation, and not to salvation, as the
woeful examples of Cain, Esau, and Judas declare: and therefore the Romanists
themselves do not exclude all manner of faith from repentance, but only that
faith which apprehends remission of sins by Christ, which special faith,
whereby remission of sins is believed and obtained, is joined with
repentance, Luke 24. 47. Act. 26. 18. This is our doctrine, and it is warranted
by the holy Scripture: though it pleases Bellarmine to say, that it is a bare
assertion, without Scripture.

29. As touching their crossing of it, we need fetch no other proof, then
from the Council of Trent, which in express Council. Trident. Sess. 4. cap. 3.
can. 4.
words denounces Anathema to those that make this faith, whereby we believe
the remission of our sins, a necessary ingredient into true repentance: and
yet it propounds reconciliation and remission of sins to such as do
repent: let all the world therefore know, to the eternal shame of the Romish
Religion, that remission of sins, and reconciliation, by their doctrine, may
be obtained by repentance, without faith, then which, what can be more
opposite to the Gospel of Jesus Christ?

30. If they reply that they make faith the foundation of repentance, I
answer, why do they then exclude it out of repentance? is the foundation no
part of the house? yes, it is the chiefest part: either therefore it is not the
foundation of repentance, or else it is necessarily required to the essence of
it; one or the other must needs be false: but here is the mystery of this
iniquity: by faith they mean nor a belief of the remission of our sins by
the blood of Christ, which is the true Evangelical faith, but a general
persuasion of the truth of their Religion, and a particular conceit, that he
which performs the work of penance, in the three parts thereof, shall
thereby obtain pardon of his sins, and reconciliation with God.

31. Secondly, whereas he says, that we do not satisfy for the eternal,
but for the temporal punishments of our sins, either here in this life, or
in Purgatory: he speaks nothing for the clearing of their doctrine from
opposition to the Gospel* for the Gospel teaches, that Christ our Redeemer
has made a full and perfect satisfaction for the sins of Ioh. 1. 29. 1. Ioh.
2. 2.
all the world, yielding a sufficient and worthy recompense and contentment to
God for them: and therefore, they which say that we must give any manner of
satisfaction our selves, whether for the temporal or eternal punishment due
unto them, do evidently cross the doctrine of the Gospel. And Aquin. part.
3. q. 48. art. 4.
this Aquinas* one of their own illumined Doctors, does in effect confess,
when he says, that the passion of Christ was a sufficient and super abundant
satisfaction for the sin and guilt of punishment of mankind, his passion was
as it were a price or payment, by which we are freed from both these
obligations: to bring in then the foggy mist of humane satisfactions, is to
eclipse and darken the glory of Christ's all-sufficient redemption.

32. Thirdly, whereas he finds fault with Chytraus, for saying without
proof, that auricular confession is not commanded of God, and yet he himself
does not prove it is; we might drive out one nail with another, and return
upon him his own answer: but I reply further, that diverse of his own fellow
Doctors have avouched as much: for Maldonate, Maldon. Sum. q. 18. art. 4. Eras.

Erasmus, the gloss in Gratian, and Gratian himself, and Rhenanus, with
diverse others, are of the same mind, as may appear in the texts quoted in the
margent, whose words I forbear to set down, because I shall have occasion to
handle the same in a more proper place; one thing I cannot omit, that the
testimony of Rhenanus is so plain, that our adversaries, not able to give
answer sufficient unto it, have by their peremptory authority said, Deleatur,
let it be blotted out: as they deal also with Polidore Virgill in the like
point, and with all other that stand in their way.

33. Lastly, the redeeming of penance by the purse, though Bellarmine shuffle
it over never so cunningly, yet is so palpable an abuse, and so contrary to the
doctrine of the Gospel, that the very naming of it, is a sufficient
declaration of the foulness of that Religion, which makes a mart of sin,
and sets repentance, which is the gift of God, to sale, for a little earthly
dross, and exchangeth punishment due to the body and soul, for a little
pinching of the purse.

34. The Gospel teaches, that marriage is permitted and 7 Heb. 13. 4. 1. Tim.
4. 3.
set free for all men, both Priests and people; and that the prohibition of
marriage and meats is a doctrine of Devils. But the Romish Religion forbids
marriage to a great part of men, to wit, Priests and Monks, and commands to
abstain from certain meats, upon certain days.

35. Bellarmine excepteth, and says by a distinction, that Bell. de Roman.
Pontif. l. 3. c. 23
when the Apostle says, Marriage is honorable amongst all men, he means
not all in general, for then it should be honorable betwixt the father and
the daughter, the brother and the sister; but only those that are lawfully
joined together, which they that are bound with a vow, cannot be.

36. It is a strange forehead, (but no marvel, seeing it is the forehead of
the whore of Babylon) when the Scripture says, Marriage is honorable amongst
al men, to exempt their Votaries from this honor, as if they were not in the
number of men, but beasts: and as the assertion is strange in impudency, so the
reason is more strange in folly: for though the father may not marry the
daughter, nor the brother the sister, without incest; yet the father may marry,
and the daughter may marry, and the brother, and the sister also, so that they
take those that are not prohibited by the Law of God, and nature. Now let him
show that Gods Law forbids Votaries to marry, and then he says something
to the purpose: but by his own confession, together with many of his
pewfellowes, the prohibition of marriage is no divine, but humane Cassand.

ordinance and institution: yea, the Council of Trent it self calls it but
an Ecclesiastical Law; and therefore not a Law of God, but a decree of the
Church.

37. Add to this impudency and folly, his crossing of all antiquity: for in
the Council of Nice, Paphnutius alleges this place of Scripture, against
those that went about to take away the use of marriage from the Clergy; and in
the sixth general Synod, it is expressly applied to the same purpose. And
Jerome, in defense of Charterius a married Bishop, produces the same text.

38. As touching Chrysostomes speech to Theodorus the Monk, alleged by
Bellarmine, though it seems a little to favor them at the first view: yet in
another place he cleereth himself from that suspicion: for he says plainly,
that Marriage is so honorable and precious, that a man with it may ascend into
the sacred Chair of a Bishop. What has Bellarmine got now by Chrysostomes
testimony? Surely this: If all that Chrysostom says, be sound doctrine, then
it is an error in the Church of Rome, to inhibite all that are consecrated by
holy Orders, from the use of the marriage bed: For by Aug contra Faust. lib.
30. c. 6
Chrysostom, Bishops may marry. Saint Augustines testimonies, alleged by him
in the one and twentieth Chapter, are little to the purpose: for in the first
he says plainly, that the Church of God does not forbid marriage; but only
prefer virginity before it, as a greater good: and in the second he
approoueth only abstinence from meats, and that from all in general; and
that to this end, for the castigation and mortification of the body: and not
either for merit sake, or that it is a thing unlawful, or that we may glut
our selves with some kind, and may not so much as touch others, upon pain of
heresy, which is the doctrine of the Church of Rome. This is all that S.
Augustines words import; which, as they do not deliver them from opposition to
the Gospel, so they manifestly imply these two conclusions: first, that the
Synagogue of Rome is not the Church of God, for it forbids marriage to
Priests, not as a lesser good, but as a thing simply evil. And secondly, that
they maintain in this their Church that doctrine, which of S. Paul is called,
The doctrine of Devils: for they forbid both Meats and Marriage at some times,
and to some persons, as things sinful and unlawful. And whereas the Fathers,
almost in general, say, Cyprian. lib. 1. cap. 11. Tertul. lib. de monogam.
Coster. Enchir. cap. 17.
that it is better for such as have vowed continency, to marry, then to fall
into the fire of lust; they conclude filthily, to their eternal disgrace, It
is better for a Priest to play the whoremonger, and keep a Concubine, then
after his vow of continency to be coupled in wedlock.

39. But Bellarmine covers her nakedness (whereof he Bell. quo supra.
is, as it seems, some what ashamed) with a fig leaf of a distinction: for
he says, that fornication is not simply better then marriage, but in respect
that a man has before entered into a vow, in which regard to marry after the
vow, is a greater sin then to commit fornication: and this he proves by an
example from a married woman, whose husband is either continually absent or
sick, so that he cannot perform the marriage debt unto her. It is not said
unto her, It is better to marry then to burn; but she ought to keep her
faith to her husband, and by fasting and prayer keep under and tame the
concupiscence of her nature: and therefore, says he, that precept or
permission, Let him marry, is not spoken to all, but only to such as are free,
and not if they be bound and have given their faith unto God.

39. To which I answer two things: First, I ask him, whether this vow which
(...) talk of, be only against marriage, or against all manner of
incontinency? If they say that it is the vow of chastity, and that it is
against all manner of incontinency, then how can it be that it should be
broken more by marriage, then by fornication, by having a wife, then by keeping
a whore? and that to marry, in respect of the vow, should be a greater sin,
then to commit whoredom? especially, seeing marriage is Gods ordinance, and
fornication, of the Devils institution: that an honorable and holy estate, and
this a filthy and ugly sin. If they say that the vow is against marriage
only, then what a Religion is Popery, that teaches her people to vow against
marriage, and not against fornication? against wives and husbands, but not
against whores and varlets? Surely that Religion that maintains this, cannot
be of God.

40. Secondly, to his example I answer: Marriage cannot be enjoined to her
that is married already, albeit her husband be either absent or impotent: for
that is contrary to Gods ordinance, Mal. 2. 14. Mat. 19. 5. But the vow of
single life is not Gods ordinauce, especially in so high a degree as marriage
is: for at the most it is but a Council, whereas the other is a flat Precept to
all that cannot contain: and besides, they that are married, may expect the
blessing of God upon them, using the means for their restraint in a godly
manner, and begging continency at Gods hand; because they are in a calling
ordained by God: but they that are in a vow, who either enter rashly, or are
thrust in against their wills, and contrary to Gods Commandment, not being
able to abstain, but proudly presume upon their own strength, how can they
hope for Gods blessing upon them, to strengthen them against the temptations of
the flesh? And thus this example, together with the distinction it self,
makes no whit to the justifying of their doctrine; but that it still remains
in plain contrariety and opposition to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

41. The Gospel teaches, that there is one true and solid 8.
foundation, upon which the Church of God is built, (...) to wit, 1. Cor. 3.
11. Act. 4. 11. 12.
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But the Romish congregation cries out,
that Peter, and the ordinary succession of Popes, and the Church of Rome, is
the foundation of the whole Church, and that the Church is built upon them, and
not upon Christ alone.

42. Bellarmine distinguishes of foundations, and says, that Christ is the
primary and principal foundation of the Church: but that does not hinder, but
that there may be secundary foundations: and for proof thereof he alleges,
Ephesians. 2. 20. where it is said, that we are built the foundation of the
Prophets and Apostles: and, Apoc. 11. 14. where the twelve Apostles are made
the twelve foundations of the Church.

43. To which I answer three things: First, that though it be true^^, that the
Apostles be the secundary foundations of the Church, laid upon Christ the true
Rock and foundation, as twelve goodly stones, and that upon them the Church is
built, to wit, upon Christ primarily and principally, and upon them
secundarily: yet it does not take away the Antithesis of their doctrine to the
Gospel: for they say, that Peter is the only secundary foundation, and that
he, as the chiefest stone, is laid next unto Christ; and the rest of the
Apostles built immediately upon him, and mediately by him upon Christ. But
those Scriptures say, that the twelve Apostles are twelve precious stones, laid
one by one upon Christ, and not one upon another: and twelve foundations
equally proportioned to each other, and not one placed upon the top of another:
and so it is true, that as the prerogative of the only singular foundation
belongs to Christ, so the honor of being secundary foundations, is equally
divided among the twelve Apostles: and so Peter in this respect has no greater
prerogative then the rest. And therefore this distinction delivers them not
from the snare, seeing that it makes all the twelve Apostles altogether
ioynt-foundations of the Church: and they would have Peter to be the only
foundation next unto Christ, upon whom both the Church of God, and the Apostles
themselves are built.

44. Secondly, I answer, that when the Apostles are said Aug. de verb. Dom.
ser. 13. Greg. Nyssen. in testim. ex veter. testam. de trinit. contra Iudaeos.
Cyril. de trin. l. 4. Chrysostom. in Mat. hom. 55. Ambr. in Ephesians. cap. 2. Hilar. de
trinit. lib. 2. Bell. praefat. controuers. de sum. Pont. Esaias 28. 16. 1. Pet.
2. 6. 8.
to be foundations of the Church, it is not meant of their persons, but of
their doctrine, as witness almost all the Fathers: for concerning person, it
is true which Saint Paul says, No man can lay any other foundation beside that
which is laid, Jesus Christ, 1. Cor. 3. 11. But the Romanists would not have
the doctrine of Peter, but the person of Peter to be this foundation: and for
proof thereof Bellarmine fetches this argument from the Prophet Esaias, saying,
Behold, I will lay in Sion a stone, a sure foundation: which is a plain and
manifest Prophecy of Christ, and not of Peter, as the Apostle Peter himself
expounds it: where, by the way, we may note the fearful outrage of these
Romish Rabbis against the truth of God, and the God of truth, whilst, to the
end they may advance their Popes dignity by Peter, they wrest and pervert the
Scriptures, and apply the Prophecies belonging to the Son of God, to his
servant Peter, and so make Peter himself, nay, the holy Ghost, a Liar. It were
not credible, that such blasphemous thoughts and words should nestle in the
heart, and issue out of the mouth of any, but that the Apostle Saint Paul has
foretold us, that in the time of Antichrist, because men would not receive the
love of the truth, that they 2. These. 2. 10. 11
might be saved: therefore God would send them strong delusions, that they
should believe lies, etc. But to the point: If Christ's person be the only true
foundation of the Church, in whom all the building, being coupled together,
grows unto an Ephesians. 2. 21.
holy Temple in the Lord: and that not the persons, but the doctrine, and faith
of the Apostles, are those secundary foundations which the Scripture speaks
of, as has been proved out of the Fathers: then the opposition is
vndefeasible, namely, that there is but one person the foundation of our
Church, which is our Lord and Savior, the Son of God, Christ Jesus; and yet
that Peter's person should be the foundation of the Church also together with
Christ.

45. Thirdly, I answer, that both in truth, and also in propriety of speech,
there can be but one foundation of one building: those stones that are laid
next to the foundation, are not properly a secundary foundation, but the
beginning of the building upon the foundation: and for that cause, when Peter,
and the rest of the Apostles are called twelve foundations, it cannot be
understood, that they were any ways properly foundations of the Church, either
first or second: but that our Savior, who is the substance and subject of
their doctrine, is the only true and singular foundation of the Church, and
that there is none other besides him: for if, when it is said that we are built
upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, is meant the doctrine of the
Prophets and Apostles, as must needs be, because the Prophets are coupled
together with the Apostles, which lived not in the Christian Church, and
therefore could not be personal foundations of it, and Christ crucified is the
substance of their doctrine: then it must needs follow, that the Apostles
meaning is nothing else, but that we are built upon Christ, whom the Prophets
and the Apostles preached and believed in. And thus S. Hilary understood it,
and Saint Ambrose, and Anselmus, Hilar. de Trin. lib. 6. and lib. 2. Ambrose.
Anselmus.
who giving the foundation of the Church to Peter, expounds it sometimes of
his faith in Christ, and sometimes of Christ himself, in whom he believed. And
thus do also Salmeron the Jesuit, and Cardinal Caietane in their
commentaries Salmeron. Caietane.
upon that place, and Peter Lumbard, together with the gloss upon the place,
interpret. And so this distinction of a primary and secundary foundation, has
no foundation in the word of God.

46. The Gospel teaches, that no Apostle or Bishop, or other 9. Luke 22. 26.
Ioh. 20. 22, 23. Mat. 18. 18. 1. Cor. 3. 4. 5.
Minister of the Gospel, is superior to another of the same rank, or has
greater power and authority then another, in respect of their ministry; but
that all Ministers in their several degrees, have equal power of preaching
the Gospel, administering the Sacraments, binding, and loosing: But the Bishop
of Rome challenges to himself a supreme power over all other Bishops, and
over the whole Church, and braggeth that he has by right, a title to both the
swords, both spiritual and temporal, and that both jurisdictions do
originally pertain to him, and from him are conveyed to others, etc.

47. Bellarmine here first confesses, and secondly distinguishes: he
confesses, that the Bishop of Rome has a supreme power over all other Bishops
and the whole Church: and denies that either those places here quoted, or any
other do prove the contrary.

48. To which I answer: first, that whereas out of Luke 22. 26. and 1. Cor. 3.
4. he extracteth a disparity, and an inequality: I answer, that no man denies
it; and therefore he fights with his own shadow: he should prove not a
bare superiority, which we confess, but a superiority in the same degree; as
of one Bishop to another, and that in power, not in execution, wherein stands
the point of opposition.

49. Secondly, whereas he says, that though the power of remitting and
retayning finnes, and binding and loosing, was communicated to all the
Apostles, yet Peter was ordained chief Pastor over them all; because our
Savior Christ said unto him alone, Feed my sheep: and, To thee will I give
the Keys of the Kingdom of heaven: I answer, that in this he crosses both
himself, the Fathers, and the truth: himself, for elsewhere he confesses,
that the keys, both of Order Bell. de Romans Pontif. l. 1. c. 22.
and Jurisdiction, were given to all the Apostles indifferently: and therefore
it must needs follow, that Tibi dabo claues, was not spoken singularly, to
Peter, but generally, to them all: for if Christ gave the keys to them all, as
he confesses, then without doubt he promised them to them all, or else his
word and his deed should not accord together. And again, he acknowledges
that all the Apostles had both power and commission to feed the sheep of
Christ, when ( Mat. 28.) he bade them all, Go, teach and baptize: and they all
did put that commission in execution: therefore it must needs follow, that no
singular power was given to Peter, when as Christ said unto him, Feed my
sheep, unless we will say, that the rest had not the same commission.

50. The Fathers: for Saint Cyprian says plainly, that all Cyprian. de
simplicit. praelat.
the Apostles were the same with Peter, endued with equal fellowship both of
honor and power, and that a primary was given unto Hilar de Trin. lib. 6.
Peter, that the Church might appear to be one. Saint Hilary is of the same
mind, You, O holy and blessed men (says he) for the merit of your faith, have
received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and obtained a right to bind and
loose in Heaven and earth. Saint Augustine says, that if when Christ said, To
thee Aug. in Johan. tract. 50.
will I give the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, he spoke only to Peter, then
the Church has not the power of the keys: but if the Church has it, then
Peter receiving the keys, represented the Church. And lastly, Leo, one of
their own Popes, confesses Leo ser. 3. de universe. assump suae.
as much, when he affirms, that the strength of this power of the keys,
passed unto all the Apostles, and the constitution of this decree unto all the
Princes of the Church.

51. Lastly, the truth: for when the Apostles strove for superiority, Christ,
who is truth it self, and would not have concealed so necessary a truth, if
it had been a truth, upon so fit an occasion, never preferred Peter, but
exhorts all, and so Peter also, to equality and humility: yea, not only so,
but expressly forbad all king-like and monarchical superiority amongst them;
and not only tyrannical, as Bellarmine would have it, as may evidently
appear by comparing Luke 22. 26. with 1. Pet. 5. 3.

52. Thus he confesses their doctrine: next he comes to distinguish of it,
namely, that their Apostolical power was equal in respect of the people, but
yet not equal between themselves; in which respect Peter was not only a
common Pastor with his fellow Apostles, but extraordinarily pastor pastoru^, a
Pastor of the Pastors, that is, of the Apostles themselves: this is his
distinction: but it is idle and vain, as may appear by this reason: because,
if he were the chief Pastor of the Apostles, then he either ordained them to
their offices, or fed them with his doctrine, or governed them by his
authority, or did some part of the office of a Pastor unto them: but he
neither ordained them; for Christ himself did that: Ioh. 20. 21. Act. 2. 3.
nor^ed them with doctrine; for they were all taught of God, and equally
received the holy Ghost, which did lead them into all truth: nor governed them;
for they sent him, he did not send them, and called him to an account, he did
not call them; and therefore was no ways to be esteemed their Pastor and
super-intendent, but their equal, and Co-Apostle.

53. And whereas he defends the extrauagant of Pope Boniface (which is so
rightly termed, for containing a most extrauagant doctrine from the truth) he
must needs defend this double jurisdiction by the speech of Peter to our
Savior, Ecce duo gladii, behold, here are two swords, and his answer to the
same, It is enough: with how absurd a collection it is, let his own fellows
be Judges. Franciscus de Victoria, Stella, Maldonate, Arias Montanus, and
Suares the Jesuit: All which, with many others, reject this collection of
theirs, as most absurd, and impertinent: I conclude, if Pope Boniface did
extrauagate in that extrauagant, in the application of this place, why do they
hold, that the Pope cannot err iudicially? If he did not, whydoe so many
learned men of his own side contradict him? Either sure the Popes two swords
are ru^^ie, and cannot be unsheathed, or else he would never suffer his
authority to be thus diminished, not only by his enemies, but even by those
that fight under his own banner. And thus this Antithesis also stands
unblemished, for all that is yet said to the contrary.

54. The Gospel teaches, that there is but one Mediator 10 1. Tim. 2. 5. 6.
1. Ioh. 2. 1. Ioh. 14. 13. Ioh. 14. 6. Heb. 9. 15.
betwixt God and man, even the God-man Jesus Christ, and that he being the
only Propitiatour, is also the only Mediator. But the Church of Rome
teaches, that as many Saints as are in Heaven, so many Mediators and
Intercessours we have to God; and among the rest, the blessed Virgin, the
mother of our Lord, whom they call their Aduocatresse, Deliueresse,
Mediatresse, Sauiouresse, and Comfortresse.

55. Bellarmine seeks to escape from this Contradiction, Bell. de Sanctor.
beatit. l. 1. c. 20.
by a threefold distinction: first he says, that Christ indeed is the only
Mediator of redemption, because he only made reconciliation betwixt God and
us, by paying the ransom for our sins; but nevertheless the Saints are
Mediators of intercession, by praying for us. This he barely affirms,
without any proof; and therefore it seems he would have us take it upon his
word for current coin, without any trial: but we have learned out of Gods
word, to try the spirits, and to weigh all such ware in the balance of the
Sanctuary: and therefore finding by the Scripture, that Christ did not only
pay the ransom for our sins, but also, that he makes request for us. and
not finding in all the book of God, that the Saints in Heaven either do
present our prayers unto God, or make request for our particular necessities,
we have just cause to reject this distinction, as too light ware, and as
counterfeit coin.

56. I but (says he) the Saints triumphant pray for the Saints militant,
therefore they are their Mediators. I answer, Though it be granted that they
do pray for them in general, which indeed is not denied: and in particular,
which can never be proved; yet the argument has no good consequence, that
therefore they should be our Mediators: for (as Bellarmine Ball. de Christ^
Mediat. l. 5. c. 5.
himself confesses) A Mediator must be a middleman, differing from each
party at variance, after some sort: but the Saints triumphant are not medi^,
betwixt God and us, both because in presence they are always with God, and
never with us, and also in semblance more like to God, then unto us, for they
are perfectly happy, holy, and righteous, we being miserable, sinful, and
wicked: and in knowledge they are satisfied with heavenly objects, and have no
participation with humane affairs: being therefore thus far removed from us,
and so near knit unto God in all these, by his own rule, they cannot any
ways be our Mediators, neither of redemption, nor intercession.

57. His second distinction is that Christ is called the only Mediator,
because he is the Mediator, not only in regard of his office, but also of
his nature, for that he is in the midst betwixt God and man, he himself
being God and man. To which I answer, that it is most true which he says,
but yet it is both contrary to that which he himself has delivered
elsewhere, and also overthrows that which he holds here: for the first,
he labors to prove in another place, that Christ is the Mediator only in
respect of his humane nature, and here he says, in respect of both natures:
how can these be reconciled? mary, by another distinction: It is one thing
(says he) to be a Mediator in respect of person, Bell. de Christo Mediat.
l. 1. cap. 1. 3. 4.
and another thing in respect of operation: in the first, Christ is the
Mediator by both natures in the second, by his humane nature only. As if he
did not operate and work the Mediation in the same respect that he is
Mediator. I, but he will say, the chief work of our redemption was the
death of Christ, but the Godhead cannot dye: therefore, etc. I answer, Though
Christ died as he was man, yet the person that died, was God and man: for (as
Tolet his fellow Jesuit and Cardinal Tolet. comment. in Job. 10.
observes) Christ dyed not as other men, in whose power it is not, either to
hold the soul in the body, or to recall it back again, being expelled: but
Christ joined his soul and body together at his pleasure: as he that holding
a sword in one hand, and a scabbard in another, pulls it out, or thrusts it in
at his pleasure. By which it is plain, that though Christ dyed in respect of
his manhood, yet the author of his death was his Godhead, and so he is our
Mediator in both natures. Secondly, he overthrows his own positio^, by this
distinction: for first, if Christ be the only Mediator in respect of office
and of nature; then the Saints are no ways our Mediators: for if they be,
they must be one of these two ways, unless we will say, that they do that
which belongs not unto them, but like busy-bodies, are pragmaticall in another
charge: which, far be it from us to think of those blessed creatures; but
both these ways (he says) Christ is the only Mediator; therefore the
Saints, by his own conclusion, are no Mediators at all.

58. His third distinction is, that therefore Christ is called the only
Mediator, because he prays for all, and none for him: but the Saints are
such Mediators, that they themselves stand in need of a Mediator. I answer,
that therefore they are no Mediators at all: for if the Saints in Heaven stand
in need of a Mediator themselves, then it must necessarily follow, that they
are not Mediators at all: for they that are parties, cannot be vmpiers. And
this is that which Aug. contra ^ar. l. 2. cap. 8.
Saint Augustine plainly affirms (though Bellarmine labors to distort his
words to another sense) when he says, He, for whom none entreats, but he
entreats for all, is the only true Mediator. And thus it is clear, that
the doctrine of the Church of Rome, touching the mediation of Saints, is
directly contrary to the doctrine of the Gospel.

59. The Gospel teaches, that Christ Jesus has made a II 1. Ioh. 1. 7. 1.
Ioh. 2. 2. Esaias. 53. 45.
full and perfect satisfaction for all our debts, and so is our full and
perfect Redeemer: But the Church of Rome teaches, that Christ has satisfied
but in part for our debts, to wit, neither for all our sin, nor for all the
punishment due unto all our sin, and so that he is not our full and perfect
Redeemer.

60. This doctrine of the Gospel is so evidently propounded in holy Scripture,
that our adversaries themselves acknowledge it in general to be true: for
Aquinas, where the Apostle says, I suffer all things for the Elects sake, that
they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, asks Aqui in 2.
Tim. 2. lect. 2.
this question, What, was not the passion of Christ sufficient? and answers
to the same, Yes; as touching the working of salvation. And Bayus says, that
there is but one satisfaction only unto God, and that of Christ: yea,
Bellarmine himself Bayus de Indulg. cap. vlt. Bell. de Purgat. lib. 9. cap. 10.
acknowledges as much in general; for he affirms, that the merit of Christ
is sufficient to take away all sin and punishment: neither dare any of the
rest for shame in plain words deny the same: because, if they did, many
manifest texts of Scripture would convince them of impiety and heresy.

61. And that the other is the doctrine of the Church of Council. Trident. Sess.
4. sub Iuli^ cap. ^. Catechism. Romans tract. de satisfact. Tapper. explicat.
art. Lovan. art. 6 Vega lib. 13. cap. 36.
Rome, the Council of Trent will witness, which thus defines: When God
forgiueth a sinner, he forgiueth not all the punishment, but leans the party
by his own works to satisfy, till it be washed away. Yea, they affirm not
only, that we our selves must satisfy for the temporal punishment, but also
for the relikes of sin, and for the fault it self; yea, for that punishment
that should be suffered in hell, excepting the eternity: yea, so impious and
shameless are some of them, whose books are notwithstanding authorized by the
Church of Rome, that they affirm, that Christ dyed only for original sin,
and that the satisfaction of Christ deserves not the Aquin. tom. 17. Opus 58.
Sacra. Altar. cap. 1. fol. 41. Col. 2. Tapper. tom. 1. art. 6. page 154. Biel.
3. Did. 18. and 19. Scot. Durand. Biel. in Suares tom. 1. disp. 4. sect. 11.
name of a satisfaction for our sins. Let the world judge now, whether these
positions of the Church of Rome be not flat contrary of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ: for the Gospel attributes to Christ all sufficiency of meriting and
satisfaction: but these fellows make him a Satisfier party parpale for the
sin, but not the punishment, and yet not for all our sins neither, but for
a part of them: as for original, and not actual; or iffor actual, yet for
mortal only, and not for venial. And this is the Romish Religion, though
palliated with the name of Catholic, and hidden from the sight of the common
people, under the veil of an implicit faith: which, if they should but see,
they could not choose but abhor.

62. For the healing of this wound, Bellarmine applies his wonted plaster of
a distinction. Christ's satisfaction (says Bell. de Purgat. ^. 1. cap. 10.
he) is in virtue sufficient, but not in act efficient, except it be applied
by our satisfaction: and therefore that there is but one only actual
satisfaction, which is ours; which by the grace and efficacy of Christ's
satisfaction, takes away the punishment of our sin, and makes a just
recompense to God for the same.

63. But this distinction first undermines it self: for if Christ's be a
satisfaction, then it is an actual satisfaction: if it be not an actual one,
then it is none at all. Did not he actually dye, and rise again? Did not he
actually by that death of his, satisfy Gods justice for all the Elect? Does not
the strength and efficacy ofhis death stretch it self backward to Adam, and
forward to the last believing child of Adam upon earth? If all this be true,
then it must needs be intolerable blasphemy, to say, that actually there is no
satisfaction, but our own, and that Christ's satisfaction which he made for
our sins, is indeed no satisfaction, except it be by the means of ours,
which must apply it, and as it were, give efficacy unto it.

64. Again, the ground of his distinction is absurd: for where does the
Scripture make our satisfaction a means to apply Christ's satisfaction unto us?
It tells us of other Romans 10. 17. 1. Cor. 10. 16. Gal. 2. 27. Ephesians. 3. 17.
means of application, to wit, outward, the Word and Sacraments: inward, faith
in respect of us, and the Spirit, in respect of God: but no where of this
new-deuised means, which they talk of: and besides, how can our satisfactions
apply Christ's unto us, whereas they are both satisfaction, and that to God, and
that for our sins? Nay, when as he says, that our satisfaction does include
the satisfaction of Christ in it, and so both together make but one compound
satisfaction: if they be of one natur^^ how can one apply the other? If they
be one in mixture, and composition, how is the one severed from the other?
These be absurd inconsequences, and irreconciliable.

65. Lastly, if the strength and power of satisfying, which is in our
sufferings, is wholly from the grace of God, and the virtue Scot. Durand. Biel.
in Suares ^om. 1. diss. 4. sect. 11. Bell. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 10.
of Christ's satisfaction, why do some of them hold, that a man by power of
nature, without grace, may be able to satify for Venial sins, and expel
them? nay, why does Bellarmine say, that a righteous man has right to Heaven,
by a twofold title; one of the merits of Christ, by grace communicated unto
him; and another of his own merits? By which, he plainly divides our merits
from Christ, and ascribes a satisfactory power to them, equal to the death of
Christ it self, and that without the help of grace. Nay, why do they not say
plainly, that Christ has satisfied for us, without any intermixing of our
own; but that their wisdom perceived, that then Purgatory, Masses, Penance,
Romish pardons, yea, and the Popes Kitchen it self, and the very marrow of all
their Pomp, shall fall to the ground? And this indeed is the very ground of
this blasphemous doctrine.

66. Doctor Bishop, misliking this distinction, as it Bishops answer to
Master Perkins reformed Catholic.
seems, flies to another. In sin (says he) there are two things, the one
is the turning away from God, whom we offend: The other is, the turning to the
thing, for the love of which we offend. Now, the turning away from GOD, both
the sin, and the eternal pain, due unto it, are freely through Christ
pardoned: but for the pleasure we took in sin, we our selves are to
satisfy, and according to the greatness thereof, to do penance. Thus
dreameth Doctor Bishop: but let his own fellow Doctor waken him, and he of
greater credit then himself: Aquinas it is, who rejects this Aquin. suplem.
q. 13. art. 1.
distinction, as nothing worth, and gives this reason of his rejecting,
because satisfaction answers not to sin, but according as it is an offense
to God, which it has not of converting to other things, but of auerting and
turning from God. And surely his reason is passing good: for to v^^ the
Creatures, and to love the Creatures, is not sin: but to use them disorderly,
and to love them immoderately: which disordered use, and immoderate love, is
the very turning, and auersion from God: and therefore, to say, that we
satisfy not for our auersion from God, but for our conversion to the creatures,
is to say, either that we satisfy for that which is no sin, or else, that
some part of sin is not an auersion from God: both which, are equally absurd,
and Doctor Bishop cannot give a third: and therefore his distinction is a mere
foppish dream, without head or foot.

67. The Gospel teaches, that there is given no other 12 Act. ^* 12.
name under Heaven, whereby we must be saved, but the name Jesus. But the
Church of Rome propounds unto us other names to be saved by, as, the Virgin
Mary, the Saints, and Martyrs, yea, Francis, and Dominick, etc. For they make
them Mediators of intercession to God for us: which office belongs only unto
Christ, as has been showed; and they teach, that we are saved by their merits,
as well as by the merits of Christ; and that as there are diverse mansions in
Heaven, so among the Saints there are diverse offices; some have power over one
thing, some over another, as Saint Peter against infidelity. Saint Agnes for
Chastity. Saint Leonard for Horses. Saint Nicholas against ship-wracke. Saint
James for Spain. Saint Denis for France. Saint Mark for Venice, etc. Yea,
they would make men believe, if a man, being otherwise a vyler sinner, dye in
the habit of Saint Francis, or Saint Dominick, etc. must needs go straight to
heaven, without any more ado: and that, as it may seem, though he has
neither faith nor repentance.

68. Lastly, they are not ashamed to say, that the death and passion of Christ,
and of the holy Virgin together, was Galat. de arcan. Catholic. verita^.
Briget. Revel. page 21.
for the redemption of mankind: and as Adam and Eve sold the world for one
Apple; so Mary and her Son redeemed the world with one heart: and therefore
as they called him Savior, so her Sauiouresse: as him Mediator, so her
Mediatresse: as him the King of the Church, so her, the Queen. If this be not
to repose the confidence of our salvation upon other names, besides the Name of
Jesus, let the world be judge.

69. Yet for all this, they think to cover this their filthiness by a
distinction: for they say that they do not fly Bell. de Sanct. beatit. l. 1.
c. 17.
to the Saints, as authors and giuers of good things; but as Impetrators and
Intercessors. To which I answer* that to omit their doctrine which has at
large been discovered before, the very form of their prayers does extinguish
this distinction: for when they cry and say, O Saint Peter, have mercy on me,
Save me, Open me the gate of heaven, Give me patience, Give me fortitude,
etc. And to the blessed Virgin, O Mediatrix of God and men: o Fountain of
mercy, Mother of grace, Hope of the desolate, Comforter of the desperate, etc.
receive this my humble petition, and give me life everlasting: And to Saint
Paul, Vouchsafe to bring us, whom thou have caused to know the light of truth,
after the end of this mortality, thither, where thou thy self art: Do they
not make them authors and giuers of these things? Yes, in word, (says
Bellarmine) but not in sense: for the meaning of these Bell. Ibid.
petitions is, that by their prayers and merits they would obtain of God
these good things. But, alas, how should the common people understand their
meaning, seeing the sound of their words are so plain to the contrary? Again,
why do they not propound their sense in playner terms, but leave it thus
inuolued under dark riddles, to the great offense of thousands? And lastly,
how harsh an interpretation must this needs be in the ears of all men, Give me
everlasting life, that is, Pray to God that he would give me it? If a man
should speak so in his common talk, no man would understand him otherwise
then his words sound: how much less can these spiritual matters be otherwise
understood then they are spoken? Surely this shift is so filly, that if it
might stand good, what might not a man speak, and yet excuse it sufficiently
after this manner? And though the Council of Trent seem to grant to the
Saints the power only of intercession, as Bellarmine also does: yet the Roman
Catechism, set Catechis. Romans
forth by the commandment of the Pope, and decree of the same Council, does
clearly and expressly attribute unto the Saints the power of Mercy, Grace,
and Donation of benefits. Whereby it appears, that this is not the opinion of
some private men, but the received and approved doctrine of the Church. And
thus this distinction vanishes before the truth, as snow against the Sun.

70. The Gospel teaches, that every soul be subject to 13 Romans 12. 1. 1.
Pet. 2. 13.
the higher powers: and that we submit our selves unto all manner of ordinance
for the Lords sake, whether unto King or unto Governors, etc. And our Savior
himself confesses, that Ioh. 19. 11.
Pilate had power ever him from God, when he faith, Thou could have no power
at all against me, except it were given thee from above. But the Church of Rome
teaches, that neither the Pope himself, nor any of his Clergy, are subject
to the temporal power of Princes, either to be judged of them, or punished by
them, no not in cases of fact, when they are guilty of heinous crimes; as of
Treason, Murder, Theft, etc.

71. This doctrine, though it be contradicted by many learned Doctors of their
own side: as, Occham, Marsilius, Pataninus, Barclay a late French Lawyer, and
others, yet is maintained by their Popes and Cardinals, Jesuits, and Canon
Laws, which are the very synewes of Popery, as not only true, but necessary
to salvation: and therefore we may well call it, The doctrine of their Church.
For Popes: John August. Triump. de potest. eccles. 4. 4. art. 1.
the two and twentieth commanded Augustinus Triumphus of Ancona, to write a
Book, wherein he maintains this position, That all the power of Emperors
and Kings is subdeligate, in respect of the power of the Pope. And again, that
all secular power is to be restrained, enlarged, and executed at the
commandment ofthe Pope. This is the assertion of that man, who was authorized
first to write by Pope John the two and twentieth, and after, his Book was set
forth, by the privilege of Gregory the thirteenth. So that here we have two
Popes maintayning this doctrine. Clement the first was of the same mind, who
affirms, that he, and Clement. lib. 2. de sentent. and re iudicat. can. 2.
the rest of the Popes, had a soueraignity and superiority over the Empire: and
upon that ground he dissanulled all the Sentences and Processes made by Henry
the seventh Emperor. And so also was Boniface the eighth, who in that famous
Canon, Extrauag. Com. lib. 1. de mayor. and obedient. c. vnam Sanctam.
Vnam sanctam, etc. directly affirms, that the Temporal authority must be
subject to the Spiritual: and that it is necessary to salvation, to believe
that every humane creature is subject to the Pope of Rome. Now the rest of the
Popes must needs be of the same mind, or else they should condemn these of
error, and that speaking definitiuely, which is contrary to their Religion. And
so indeed that they are, Bellarmine their Champion, in his late Book against
Barclay the Lawyer, does manifestly declare, who most impudently maintayneth
this position with all his wit against that learned man: as also in his last
doting Apology against our King, wherein, without doubt, he is authorized, and
as it were tapped on the back, and called, A good child, by the Popes
Holiness himself.

72. Thus we see this doctrine maintained by the Popes and their Laws. Let us
see also what the Cardinals and the Jesuits say unto it. Cardinal Baronius,
a notable clawer of Baronius.
the Popes, holds, that the Pope has power directly over Princes, agreeing
with Bozius and Triumphus: but Cardinal Bellarmine, with others on his side,
quallifieth the matter, and Bell. de Romans Pontif. lib. 5. cap. 4 and 5.
says, that the Popes power over Princes in temporal matters, is not direct,
but indirect, as depending upon his spiritual power, and in order and relation
unto that. Let us leave these Greg. de Valen. tom. 3. Com. Tollet. in Ioh. cap.
21.
two Cardinals fighting about direct and indirect, and come to the other
Jesuits. Gregory de Valentia says, that the Pope is subject to none; but that
by a certain hereditary right he is exempted from all humane jurisdiction.
Tollet affirms, that there may be in the Church many holier and learneder
then the Pope, but none superior or equal unto him in dignity. Turrian the
Jesuit says, that Christ has translated all his Turrian. de Eccles. l. 1. c.
3.
Kingdom on earth upon the Pope, who bears his person, and carries his
Image. And lastly, all of them, like lines in a circle, meeting in a Center,
join in this, that the Pope has power to depose Kings, to translate
Kingdoms, and to confer them upon others, if it seem to him necessary for
the good of men's souls.

73. Thus we have their doctrine concerning their Head, the Pope. Now let us
hear what they say touching the body that hangs upon his head, their Clergy:
Kings are not now any more Sovereigns over Clerks (faith Bellarmine,) and
Bell. de Cleric. cap. 28.
therefore Clerks are not bound to obey them by Gods law or man's, except it be
in respect of directive laws. And Emanuel Sa. affirms, Emanuel. Sa. Aphoris.
confess. verb. Cler.
that a Clergy man cannot be a Traitor, though he rebel, because he is no
subject. And it was long ago the doctrine of the Friars; continued by the
Jesuits, that the King was not Lord over the Clergy; but that the Pope was
their Lord: and therefore though a Clergy man had committed theft, murder, or
treason, yet he ought not to be called in question, much less punished for
it by a temporal Magistrate: but Houeden. Hen. 2
ought to be judged by Ecclesiastical Judges, and in the Ecclesiastical
Court: and if he were convict, he should lose his Orders, and so being
excluded from Office and Benefice Ecclefiasticall: if after this he incurred
the like fault, then might he be judged at the pleasure of the King: yea, they
go so far, Maynard de Priuiledg. eccles. art. 17. nu. 10.
that if any offense were committed by diverse persons, amongst whom there were
one Clergy man, none of the offenders were subject to temporal jurisdiction.
And thus we see, that neither the Pope nor his Clergy will be subject to
these higher Powers, to which the Gospel commands all men to submit
themselves.

74. How will they distinguish here? Mary, they have two distinctions to help
this doctrine out of the mire, and yet all too weak. First, they say, that
when the Apostles, Paul and Peter, commanded every soul to be subject, etc.
they mean generally, that all subjects should obey their superiors, whether
Spiritual or Temporal: and not that every Bell. de Romans Pontif. l. 2. c. 29.
one should particularly be subject to the King or secular power: which
interpretation is first flat contrary to the text: for both Paul and Peter
mention expressly Kings and Princes, and such as have the right of the sword:
which they would never have done, if Kings should have been subject to Popes,
and not Popes to Kings: for then they would have instanced in Popes, and not in
Kings: and though Christians were falsely accused of treason and rebellion to
Princes, yet this could not be a sufficient reason to move the Apostles to
conceal so necessary a truth, especially seeing they write to Christians and
not to Infidels.

75. Secondly, it is contrary to reason: for if Peter, and so the Pope, his
pretended successor, had been in their judgment superiors to Kings, then
surely Peter himself, writing not only to the people, but also to the Elders
of the Church, as appears, 1. Pet. 5. 1. would never have enjoined them all
to the obedience of the Civil Magistrate, but would have reserved some to his
own jurisdiction, and bidden them all, both Magistrate and people, to submit
themselves unto him, as the head of the Church: or if he for modesty might
forbear this imperial iniunction; yet, without question, Paul (had he been
of that mind) would not have sent every soul to be subject to Kings, but
would have told them, that Kings and all should be subject to Peter: but seeing
that neither of them both does it, neither here nor elsewhere; and it is, as
they think, so necessary a thing to be believed of all men, it is most evident
that they never meant it.

76. Thirdly, and lastly, whereas the Apostle Paul commands every soul to
be subject, we may conclude, that if the Pope be a soul, or have a soul (for
some of them have thought that a man had no more a soul then a beast) then he
must be subject. And this conclusion a learned man, that was Aeneas Siluius in
gest. Council. Basiliens. Chrysostom. and Oecumen. in Romans 13. 1.
afterward a Pope himself, made, when he plainly confessed, that the Apostle
did not except animam Papae, the Popes soul from this subjection. I omit here
S. Chrysostomes and Oecumenius exposition of the same place; both which
affirm, that by every soul, the Apostle included both Priests, Monks, and
Apostles, and that this subjection was not contrary unto Aug. Confess. lib. 3.
cap. ^. Nazianz. in orat. ad subdit. and Imper. Gregor. lib. 2. indict. 11. c.
100. Bell. de Romans Pontif. lib. 2. ca. 29.
piety. And to this exposition subscribe most of the Fathers.

77. Secondly, they distinguish upon that place of John, where our Savior
confesses himself to be under the power of Pilate, to be judged by him, and
say, that either it is to be understood of a permissiue power granted by God,
without the which, no not sins can be committed: with Cyrill and Chrysostom:
or, if of the power of jurisdiction, with Augustins and Bernard, that then
Pilate had power over Christ, not simply, but by accident: to wit, as he was
reputed to be a private Jew, and so no more then a mere man: by which
ignorance of the person, his power was justified to be lawful: as if a Civil
Magistrate should condemn a Clerk in the habit of a Lay man, not knowing him
to be a Clerk, he should be free from blame. To which I answer: First, that
the power of the Emperor, though a heathen, was lawful, and ordained by God,
as they themselves confess* and as the Scriptures in many places prove: but
Pilates Mat. 22.
power was from the Emperor, therefore it was a lawful, and not a lawless
power; and so not only by permission, but also by ordination. Secondly, if it
were only a power by permission, then Pilate had sinned in executing that
power upon Christ: but because of the mistaking of the person, therefore he
says, he was free from fault: as a Civil Magistrate, that should judge a
Clerk, taking him for a Lay man. And so one part of his answer crosses the
other. Lastly, I answer, that though Pilate might err in the person of
Christ, yet Christ could not err in the power of Pilate, who affirms of it
plainly, that it was of God; and so it was indeed, in respect of the power it
self, though the abuse of it, in the condemning of an Innocent, was a sin:
and so from the Devil, and not from God.

78. The Gospel teaches, that before regeneration we 14. Ephesians. 2. 1. Romans
6. 13. Luke 15. 31. and 9. 60.
are dead in sin, and have no more power to move in any work of grace, then
a dead carcass has in the works of nature: and therefore can neither will nor
do that which is good. But the Church of Rome teaches, that a man
unregenerate Council. Trident. Sess. 6. cap. 1. can. 6. Bell. de great. and lib.
arbit. cap. 10. Salmer. tom. 13. page 32. and 38. Coster. Enchirid. page 204.
Ecchius, Enchir. Molyn. disp. 12.
is not spiritually dead, but wounded, like the man that fell among thieves
betwixt Ierico and Jerusalem: or, like a Prisoner with setters on his heels:
or, like a Bird entangled in a lime-bush: and therefore that there is remaining
in him so much power, both in his will and understanding, that being but helped
a little by grace, he can begin his conversion, and so deserve a more
plentiful grace of justification. All this they affirm: then which, what can
be more contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which says, that we are
stark dead in sin, and are not able to think a good thought of our selves:
but that all our sufficiency is in God, and that he works in us both the will
and the deed, etc?

79. Bellarmine here likewise endeavors to escape by Bell. de great. and lib.
arbit. l. 6. c. 13.
a double distinction: First, he says, that a sinner, because he is
spiritually dead, cannot of himself, or by his own power, recover life, or
prepare himself thereunto: but yet being prevented and helped by grace, he may
cooperate with God that quickneth him: for that he does not, as being dead, but
as having a vital virtue inspired into him by God.

80. For answer whereunto, let me propound unto him this question, namely,
Whether this spiritual life, which is the first degree of a sinners
conversion, be inspired into him altogether by the Spirit of God, without the
help of his own will? or whether it arises partly from grace, and partly
from his will. If he says, Altogether from the Spirit, without the help of
his will: then how does the sinner cooperate with God in his first conversion?
If he say, Partly from grace, and partly from free will: then how is the sinner
dead, when yet he does work toward the obtaining of his own life? Can a dead
man cooperate at all, much more toward his own life? I, but he is prevented
and excited to grace, and so does work: but then I would know, whether in that
first exciting and stirring up, he does work with Gods Spirit? whether he be
active in that first motion, or passive only? If active, then he is not dead:
if passive, then the first degree of his conversion and spiritual life is only
from grace, without the coadiution of this free will: for this excitation and
stirring up of his will, is the first spark of spiritual life in a sinner;
and this is that which S. Augustine affirms, saying, Aug. de great. and lib.
arbiter. c. 17.
that God without us works in us to will, (that is the first spark of life:)
then works with us, and helps us when we do will, (this is the second.)
And again, The will is first changed from Idem. cap. 20. Idem. Enchirid. cap.
32.
evil to good, and helped when it is good. And again, He prepares the good
will that is to be helped; and helps it when it is prepared. In all which
passages, the first conversion of a sinner is ascribed to God alone, and man's
will is a dead thing that moves not: but the succeeding works are attributed
jointly to God and us. And this is the very doctrine of the Gospel: which
Bellarmine plainly crosses by his distinction, though subtly he seems to
do nothing less: for he says plainly in another place, that in the act of
our conversion, Bell. de great. and lib. arbit. lib. 6. cap. 15. and lib. 4.
cap. 16. Alex. part. 3. m. 1. art. 2. ad. 1.
will is truly free, and determines it self, though God move and apply it to
the work. And another compares the will to an eye in a darkeplace, which
though it see not, yet can see as soon as light comes, because in it self
it has the faculty of seeing: then which, what can be more contrary to the
Gospel? the one affirming, that a sinner is dead before his regeneration: the
other, that he is but half dead, and wounded, and has some power, and
therefore life in himself to grace and rghteousnes.

81. Bellarmine perceiving the weakness of this distinction, flies for succor
to another: and that is, though a sinner be dead to grace, yet he is alive to
nature; and so is not altogether dead: and that by the power of that natural
life, he being helped by grace, can cooperate with God in his conversion: and
therefore that the similitude of a dead man does not in every respect agree
unto the unregenerate; because a dead man has no life in him at all; but a man
unregenerate has notwithstanding the life of nature in him. But this is more
absurd then the former: for, first it is plain, that the unregenerate are as
dead in respect of grace, as a dead carcass is in respect of nature: for they
have no more ability to the works of grace, then a dead man to the works of
nature. A dead man has no appetite or desire to natural things: no more has
the unregenerate to spiritual things. A dead man has no understanding of the
things of this world: no more has the unregenerate of the things that are of
God. A dead man cannot move the members of the body, nor use the natural
saculties of the soul: no more can the unregenerate move one hair breadth to
Heauen-ward, nor use any graces of the Spirit. A dead man has no sense, nor
feeling, though he be never so sharply handled, sees not, though the Sun
shines never so bright, hears not, though a trumpet be sounded in his ear:
no more can the unregenerate feel the wounds of Gods Laws, hear the sound of
the Gospel, nor see the clear light of truth that shinethround about him.
Lastly, in a dead man, there is a separation of the soul from the body: so, in
the unregenerate, there is a separation of Gods Spirit from the soul, which is
the soul of the soul. For this cause S. Aug. likened the unregenerate man, to
the Shunamites Aug. de verbis Apostol. ser. 11.
son, being dead, whom the Prophet Elizeus raised from death, to life; and
others, to Lazarus stinking in the grave, or, to the widows son of Nai^^,
lying dead; upon the bear; or, to Iairus daughter, that was dead in the house:
noting three degrees of sins, one more notorious then the other, yet all in
the state of death, until Christ by his Spirit shall inspire life into them:
and this is the perfect analogy and proportion, betwixt a dead man, and a
sinner: and therefore Bellarmines exception is false, that they do not agree
in all things: for there is nothing, wherein they do agree, not, if the
comparison be rightly proportioned.

82. Secondly, if they did disagree in other things, yet in this, wherein lies
the life of the similitude, they must needs agree, that as a dead man has
nothing, whereby he can help himself, for the recovery of his life: so man
spiritually dead, has nothing in him, no faculty, or power of the soul,
whereby he can any way further the obtaining of his co^uersio^. And this was
Saint Augustines opinion, agreeable to the Gospel: Aug. de great. and lib.
arbit. cap. 5.
for his words are plain, concerning Paul's conversion, that he was called from
Heaven, and by that mighty and effectual calling converted. Gratia
Deisolaerat: It was only the grace of God. And no otherwise did Iustine Martyr
conceive Justin. Martyr. Apolog. 2.
thereof, when he says, That as to have being at the first, when we are
created, was not of our selves: so to choose and follow that which is pleasing
to God, is (not by us) but by his persuading, and moving us to the faith. In
this therefore, which is the point of the question, the similitude holds most
strongly, and so Bellarmines exception is nothing to the purpose.

83. Thirdly, and lastly, it is most absurd of all, which he says, that
because a sinner lives naturally, therefore he moves toward grace, more then
a dead carkas to nature, which has no life at all: for in respect of grace, it
is all one to have no life at all; and to have no life of the Spirit. For
nothing can work above the compass of it own being. Natural life cannot
tranicend the Sphere of nature, nor any way move to the Sphere of grace. For
as Plants that live the vegetative life, cannot arise to the sensitive life,
which is in beasts, nor they to the rational, which is in men: So neither can
these arise up any whit to the life of the Spirit, which is in Gods Saints,
till a new life be inspired into them: which new life, as it is the conversion
of the soul to God, so it is the foundation of all spiritual actions, seeing
life in every kind is the foundation of all the actions in that kind. For
until there be life in a plant, it does not grow, until it be in a beast,
it does not move nor feel, until in a man, he does not think, speak, or
remember; and so until this life of the Spirit be in the soul, it cannot
will, nor work any thing that is good. Therefore I conclude, that though a
sinner live naturally, yet being dead to grace, that that life does no more
help to his conversion, then the sensitive life of a beast does to the
obtaining of reason, or the vegetative 15 Ioh. 5. 39. Col. 3. 16. 1. Pet. 3.
15. 1. Ioh. 2. 12. 13. 14. Luke 16. 19.
life of a Plant to the obtaining of sense.

84. The Gospel teaches, that all should read the Scriptures, for so our
Savior charge; and his Apostles Paul and Peter, and John, charge not Priests
only, but all others. And Abraham sends the rich Gluttons brethren to Moses,
and the Prophets. And the Eunuch is not rebuked, but approved Acts. 8 28. Acts
17. 11.
by Philip, for reading the Prophecy of Esaias. And the Bereans are commended
for examining Paul's doctrine by the Scripture: which should never have been,
if it had not been lawful for them to do it. This is the doctrine of the
Gospel, Bell. de verbo Det. lib. 2. cap. 15 Azorius Instit. moral. l. 8. c.
26. Council. Trident. Regul. 4. Iud. librer. Coster. Enchirid.
most plain and evident. But the Church of Rome teaches, that all men must
not read the Scripture, to wit, Laymen, except they be permitted by their
Ordinary, because pearls are not to be cast amongst swine: nor a sword, or a
knife put into a childs hand; nor occasion of error offered to the ignorant,
nor matter of offense to the weak: as also, because they are more obscure then
can be understood of the Laics, and common sort of people. Thus they paint
over the foul wrinkled face of Iezabel, with false colors: but yet the
contrariety is plain. All ought to read the Scriptures: and some ought not to
read the Scriptures. The one is the doctrine of Jesus Christ: The other, of the
Pope and his Church.

85. But Bellarmine distinguishes two ways. First, that there is a double way
of knowing the Scriptures; one by hearing, and another by reading. The first is
commanded to all, and therefore necessary to be used of all. But this last is
not commanded to any, but to the Clergy, and those whom they shall think fit
to read them with profit, and without danger. But who sees not, that when our
Savior wills to search the Scriptures, he speaks of reading? And when the
Bereans examined Paul's sermon by the Scriptures, they did it by reading. And
when Abraham remitteth Dives brethren to Moses, and the Prophets, he sends
them to reading. For Moses, and the Prophets were dead in their persons, and
lived only in their writings. And lastly, when the Apostles wrote their
Epistles to the several Churches, they wrote them to this end, that they might
be read of all. For so Saint Paul charge the Colossians, after they had read
the Epistle, that they themselves would cause it also to be read in the Church
of the Laodiceans. Besides, if it be a dangerous thing for the ignorant to
read the Scriptures, for fear they should pervert the sense, and so fall into
heresy, or impiety; then much more dangerous is the hearing of it, seeing
there is no preaching so pure as the word it self; man ever mixing some dregs
of his own corruption, with the pure wine of the word; nor any preacher so
sincere, but he does often err: and so the hearer being debarred from trying
his doctrine by the touchstone of the Scripture, must needs irrecouerably fall
into error.

86. Secondly, he says that there are two kinds of Readers. Bell. quo supra.
One that read with fruit and profit; others that read without fruit, yea
rather with hurt. Now the Scripture may be read of the first, but not of the
second. But I would know of him again, who has that power to discern betwixt
these two. Do they know the heart of a man? Or, can they prophecy of that
which is to come? If they cannot do these things, then they ought not to lock
up the Scriptures from any, upon this surmise; but permit the use of that which
is good to all, and leave the success to God. Again, because some pervert the
Scripture to their damnation, shall therefore all be forbidden to reap
comfort by it? Because the thief robs, and kills with his sword, shall not
therefore an honest man use one for his own defense? Because the Spider sucks
up poison out of the flower, therefore shall not the Be suck honey? This is to
take away the use of all good things. For as the Poet says, Nil prodest quod
non laedere possit idem: Nothing Ovid. de trist. lib. 2.
so profitable in the use, but in the abuse may be hurtful and nuisant.

87. Lastly, are the ignorant common people more subject Espe.s. us com. in
tit. c. 1. and 2.
to erring and heresy, then the learned? Let Espensaeus, a learned Bishop of
their own, inform him to the contrary. I remember (says he) that an Italian
Bishop told me, that his contrymen were scarred from reading the Scriptures,
lest they should become heretics: as if heresies did spring from the study of
the Scriptures, and not rather from the neglect and ignorance of them. And if
he will not believe him, let another Alphous. de cast. haeres. l. 1. cap. 13
Maldon. in Euangel.
learned Roman si step out and tell him, that very few ignorant persons were the
authors of heresy: and another, that learned men, and endued with great wits,
fall by their pride into heresy: so that he need not so much fear, lest
heresy should build her nest in the bosom of the poor ignorant man, as lest
like the Eagle she should fly aloft, and set her self in the top of the high
Cedars of the Church.

88. But what do I stand to overthrow this vain exception, since it is no
better then a mere deception, confuted by the practice of their own Church?
for without difference, any that will pay for it, being never so ignorant,
might have a license to read the Scriptures. And we had here in England in
Queen Mary's days, a Romish indulgence, that he that Cartwrights answer to
the Preface of the Rhemes Testament.
could dispend a certain revenue by the year, might read the Bible in
English, as is reported by Master Cartwright, in his answer to the Preface of
the Rhemes Testament. So that is as clear as the day, that it is not the fruit
and benefit that should come to the Reader, that they regarded, but the profit
and gain that should accrue to their own purses: neither was the fear of
erring the cause of their prohibition: but rather the fear of too much
knowledge, lest thereby the gross and foul abominations of their Church
should be discovered and so come to be abhorred and detested.

89. The Gospel teaches, that none can forgive sins, but 16 Esaias 43. 25. luke
5. 21.
God: because sin is a preuarication of Gods Law; and therefore none can
remit it, but he against whom it is committed. Upon which ground venerable Bede writing upon Beda in Luke 5.
these words of the fifth of Luke, Who can forgive sins, but God? says, that
the Pharisees said truly therein: because no man can forgive sins, save God
alone: who also forgiueth by them to whom he has committed the power of the
keys: and therefore Christ is proved to be truly God by this, that he can
forgive sins, as God: and it may be proved further to be true, because our
Savior himself approoueth of that speech of theirs, not showing any manner of
dislike thereunto. And therefore Saint Ambrose affirms plainly, that to
Ambros. epist. 16.
forgive sins, is not common to any man with Christ. This is (says he) the
only office of Christ, who took away the sin of the world. And Cyprian as
directly; Only the Lord can take Cyprian ser. de lapsis.
pity, and grant pardon to sins which are committed against him. But the
Synagogue of Rome teaches, that though this power Gregor. de Valent tom. 4.
page 1876. Eman. S^. in Aphoris. T^^et* lib. 6. ^* 21
be originally and fundamentally in Christ, yet he has committed the same to
his Vicar the Pope; and from him it is derived to Cardinals, Bishops, and
infetiou^ Priests, under the commission and authority of the keys: and that
not ministerially, and by way of declaration only, which we confess: but
absolutely, and iudicially, and as Christ himself; and that not only to the
living, but to the dead also, that are in Purgatory. For it is a rule without
exception amongst them, Bell. de Purgat. l^^. 2. cap. 16. Suarez* ^om. 4. disp.
50. sect. 3.
that all satisfactory punishments may be released by a pardon. And it is as
sure that a pardon for any manner of sin may be obtained for a price. And
therefore there is a certain rate set down for all kind of sins, as
Murder, Incests, Aquin. Su^lem. in 3. part. q. 25. ^rt. 1.
Sodomy, Sacrilege, etc. And Aquinas thus reasons, If Christ might release
the fault, without any satisfaction, then so may it be that the Pope. By which
we see, that according to their doctrine, the Pope has as much power to
forgive sins, as Christ himself has: which is the Scribes and Pharisees lived
and heard, they would cry out, O blasphemy. This is the express doctrine of
the Church of Rome.

90. For the making good of this doctrine, they have a double distinction,
answerable to the double manner of remitting sin, used in their Church; one
touching the absolution of a sinner, by the Priest, in their Sacrament of
penance. The other, touching the Popes indulgence, out of the Sacrament,
grounded upon the treasure of supererogatory works, which they say, is in the
Church, and consequently, in the Popes dispensation. Concerning the first (they
say) that Christ absolueth a sinner by his own power; but the Priest, by the
power of Christ, committed unto him in that famous Legacy, Whose sins ye
remit on earth, they are remitted in Heaven.

91. To which I answer two things. First, that herein they (...)and ^^^ 4.
^^^. 1^. (...)*
co^tradict their ancient school. For Peter Lumbard, one of the masters of the
school, does plainly affirm, that such only are worthily absolved by the
Church, who are absolved in Heaven: because by the error of man, it may so
happen, that he that seems to be cast out of Gods family* be still within;
and he who may be thought to remain within, is notwithstanding cast ou^. And
that therefore God absolueth differently from the Church; God by remitting the
sin, and purging the soul from the blemish thereof, and freeing it from
eternal punishment; the Church by declaring who are absolved by God. By which
not only his opinion is manifest, that the Priest has no absolute power of
absoluing a sinner, but only of declaring that he is absolved, which is our
doctrine: but also his reason is invincible, that because the Priest may err
in his absolution; therefore he has no such absolute power committed unto
him. And that we may not think that this Master of theirs is without
scholars, the gloss of their decrees does set down as much, when it says,
Dimi^tantur, Distinct 23. cap. 2. gloss.
id est, dimissa ostendantur: Let them be forgiven, that is, let them be
declared to be forgiven. Which, because it speaks too boldly; therefore their
judicious Censurers have caused it either to be blotted out, or compelled it
to speak Index. expurg. Belg. edit. Greg.
otherwise.

92. Secondly, I answer, that this doctrine is crossed by it self. For they
do not profess any other absolution, but such as may be hindered by the party
to by absolved, to wit, if by want of faith, or repentance, he put an invisible
bar to stop the power thereof. Now, if the sinner may hinder his own
absolutio^, then the Priest has no power to absolve him, except he be fitly
disposed for the receiving of it; and this disposition is merely from God: and
therefore in God is the only power to absolve; and in the Priest, only to
declare who is absolved, and that conditionally, if h^ be thus qualified, and
have no bar to hinder. For if the power of absoluing, or not absoluing,
depend upon the putting in, or taking away the bar of impenitency; then he
only can iudicially absolve a sinner, that can give him repentance: but
neither the Pope, nor any mortal man is able to do this, as the Scripture
testifies in many places: and therefore neither Pope nor Priest can absolve a
sinner any further then by a declaratiue sentence.

93. Lastly, it crosses their own practice: for they teach, that dead m^n,
dying in excommunication, may be absolved: and they practice the same, to wit,
as Bellarmine says, when Bell* de Indulg. lib. 1. cap. 14. Toll^t. Instruct.
sacerdot. l. 1. c. 16
it is discovered, that the party was erroniously excommunicate: and, as
Tollet says, when he showed manifest signs of contrition before his death: in
which case their absolution can be no more then a declaration that he did
repent, and that he is absolved before the tribunal ^^ at of God.

94. And thus this first distinction will hold no water. Let us hear the
second. Touching the Popes power to pardon out of the Sacrament, this it is:
They say, that the Pope does not by his pardon take upon him, either to remit
the guilt of Bell. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. 7.
sin, or the eternal punishment due unto it: but only the temporal
punishment which it ought to sustain, either here in this life, or in
Purgatory. But I answer, that h^e which can remit any part of the punishment
due unto sin, can also remit the guilt it s^l^e: for guilt and punishment are
inseperable companions; insomuch, as in the Hebrew tongue, Sin and Punishment
are notified by one and the same word, to show, that where the one is, there
the other is also: and therefore he that can pardon the ore, may also release
the other. Add hereunto, that to pardon a sin, is nothing else (as our
common phrase of speech, together with reason, teaches us) but to remit the
punishment thereof: as when the King, in the Court of Justice, pardons a
Malefactor, he releaseth him from the punishment which by the law he should
suffer: so in the Court of Conscience, he that does remit any part of the
punishment due by Gods Law unto a sinner, (as the Pope does undertake to do)
by the same labor does remit so much of the guilt it self. And so this
distinction fills to the ground, being as feeble and brittle as the former.

95. Lastly, the Gospel teaches, that when we have done all that we can, yet
we may say, that we are unprofitable servants, Luke 17. 10. But the Church of
Rome teaches, that ^u^* 17. 10.
a man may do more then he ought, and then the law requires: Bell. de Monach.
lib. 1. c. p. 13. Salmer tom. 7. p^g* 97.
and so may say, and think himself to be, not only a profitable, but more
then a profitable servant: for he may (say they) supererogate: now he does
supererogate, who lays out more then he received: as he that to the precepts
of Christ, adioyneth the commandments of the Church; and to the precepts of
the law, the counsels of the Gospel.

96. Bellarmine answers first out of Saint Ambrose, Bell. de Iust^f. lib. 5.
cap. 5.
that it is to be understood of us whilst we are in the state of nature, and
not of grace: as if by nature we are unprofitable, but by grace profitable: but
our Savior speaks this to his Disciples, who were now in the state of grace,
and not of nature. And Saint Ambrose his meaning is nothing else but this, that
Ambros. i^ Luke lib. 8. cap. 1^.
our natural imbecility, though it be sanctified, yet it is not abolished by
grace: and therefore that we, in regard thereof, are still bound to remember,
that when we do all we can, yet we are unprofitable.

97. Secondly, he answers, that we are unprofitable indeed; but to God, not
to our selves, which he says, is Beda's interpretation: but he leaves out
that which follows in Beda: for so far is he from building hereupon the
Beda in Luc. cap. 17.
merit of works, that he says plainly, that by whose mercy we are prevented,
that we may humbly serve him; by his gift we are crowned to reign with him.
By which it is evident, that if we b^ profitable to our selves, it is because
God accepts our service, and in mercy rewards the same; not because we
deserve any thing at his hands. To omit that the word Servants has relation to
Masters, and not to themselves: and therefore in saying they are unprofitable
servants, it must needs be understood in respect of God, and not of themselves.

98. Thirdly, he answers out of Saint Augustine, that we are said to be
unprofitable in respect of the covenant of the law: but in respct of the free
covenant of grace, we may be profitable, and more then profitable. But this is
Bellarmines fraudulent collection, and not Saint Augustines intention: for he
says only, that we can require no reward for our labor, though Aug. ser. 3.
de verb. Dom.
we have kept all the commandments, unless God of his free grace had
couenanted with us to reward us. He says not that we are made profitable by
grace, either to God our Master, or to our selves. And therefore in another
place he disclaimeth utterly all profit and merit in our selves, when he
says, Lord, Aug. in Psalm. 142.
for thy Names sake quicken me, in thy righteousness, not in mine; not because I
have deserved it, but because thou art merciful. Thus this generation is not
ashamed to wrest and wring the godly Fathers, to make them speak to their
purpose.

99. Lastly, he answers out of Saint Chrysostom, that our Savior says
not, Ye are unprofitable servants; but bids them say so of themselves, to
teach them humility, and to avoid pride. But how do this follow, that because
Christ bids us to say so, to avoid pride, therefore we are not so? yea,
rather therefore we are so: for would he bid us to lie? Chrysostom himself in
another place cleereth this doubt, when Chrysostom. ad pop. Antioch. hom. 53
he says, that all that ever we do, we do upon duty: for which cause
Christ said, When ye have done all, say, ye are unprofitable servants: So
that Chrysostom did not only think it fit for us to say so for humility
sake, but also that we were so in truth and indeed. Let Saint Bernard, for an
vpshot, wipe away Bernard. de tripl. custod.
this distinction: Will thou (says he) say, that Christ has taught thee to
say so for humility sake? true, indeed it was for humility; but what, against
truth? And thus none of these shifts and distinctions can deliver this doctrine
from opposition to the Gospel: for it follows ineuitably, if the best be no
better then unprofitable servants, then none can work such works, whereby he
may not only merit for himself eternal life, but having a surplusage of
redundant merits, bestow some of them for the supplying of others wants.

100. And thus we have a short view of the clear and manifest oppositions
that are betwixt the doctrines of the Gospel, and the doctrines of the Church
of Rome. And we see with what subtle and intricate distinctions, they labor
to reconcile them together: but truth is naked, and needs no such shiftings.
Both the one and the other therefore, namely, their direct opposition to the
Gospel on the one side, and their elaborate diflinctions, to make good their
cause on the other, does evidently euince the conclusion of this ninth
demonstration, that that Religion, which is built upon such desperate and
dangerous principles, cannot be the truth of Christ, but the doctrine and
Religion of Antichrist.

The X. MOTIVE. That Religion which nourishes most barbarous and gross
ignorance amongst the people, and forbids the knowledge and understanding of
the grounds of the Christian faith, cannot be the truth: but this does the
Romish Religion: ergo, etc.
1. IN the first proposition of this Argument, the Romanists Mayor.
hold the Wolf by the ears, not knowing whether it be better to grant, or to
deny it: for if they grant it to be true, it will fly in their faces,
because they are guilty of the contents thereof: and if they deny it, it will
bite them by the fingers: for all men will condemn them of shameless
impudency, for denying so apparent a truth. Therefore as the beast, which Pliny
calls Amphisbaena, so it stingeth both ways. But of two evils the lesser:
they must of necessity deny it, or else they must condemn their own practice
of impiety: which sure they will not do, though for their labor they gain
to themselves that name, which so frequently and imperiously they impute unto
us, Shameless Heretics: they speak it of us in the spirit of malice: but it
shall be proved of them by sound reason, and that in this demonstration
ensuing, by Gods assistance.

2. For the confirmation therefore of the first proposition a word or two,
though whatsoever can be spoken thereof, is but to add light unto the Sun:
First therefore the Scripture stands forth, and condemns ignorance so
plainly, that nothing can be more evident. Solomon tells us, That Pro. 8. 35.
they which hate knowledge, love death. And the Prophet Esaias, Esaias 5. 13.
That the people were carried into captivity, because they had no knowledge.
And the Prophet Hosca, That they were destroyed Hosca 4. 6.
for lack of knowledge. Our Savior affirms, that the cause of erring in the
Sadduces, was the ignorance of the Scripture. Mat. 22. 29.
And Saint Paul coupleth these two together in the Gentiles, Darkened
cogitations through ignorance, and strangers from the Ephesians. 4. 18.
life of God: where he plainly shows, that ignorance and destruction are
inseparable companions, as sanctified knowledge and salvation are. And (to omit
infinite other passages of holy writ) our Savior directly concludes, that he
which knows his Masters will, and does it not, shall be beaten with Ioh. 17.
many stripes: and he which knows it not, and therefore does it not, shall be
beaten too, but with fewer stripes. By which he gives us to know, that though
some kind of ignorance may extenuate and lessen the fault; yet none,
especially if it be of matters which we are bound to know, and may be attained
unto, does excuse from all fault, but is blameworthy and punishable by Gods
justice.

3. Thus speaks the holy Ghost in the Scripture, and doubtless in reason it
must needs be so; for wherein does a man differ from a beast, but in reason and
understanding? and wherein does one man differ from another, but in the
enlightening of reason by divine knowledge, which is the matter subject of true
Religion? Religion being nothing else but the knowledge and profession of the
divine truth: the want whereof must needs be a subuerter and destroyer thereof.
A Physicion that is ignorant of the grounds of his Art, we account a
Mountebanke and Imposter. And what, I pray you, can they be less, that
profess ignorance, and that in the most difficult Art of all other, the Art of
Christianity? Besides, all confess that ignorance is a defect and blemish of
the soul, and that the more knowledge a man has, the nearer he is unto
perfection, because he is the more like unto God: but the chief end of
Religion is to purge away the blemishes, and to make up the breaches of the
soul, and to renew Gods Image defaced therein, that so we may be made like unto
him, even perfect, as he is perfect. How can then true Religion teach
ignorance, which is such an enemy unto perfection? or how can that be true
religion, which nourishes ignorance, and inioyneth it unto most of her
professors and followers.

4. Let the fathers be Judges of this cause. Saint Augustine Aug. Epist. 119.
says in one place, that Ignorance, as a naughty mother, brings forth two
wicked daughters, falsehood, and doubting. And in another, that the knowledge of
God is the engine, by which the structure of charity is built up. Saint Bernard
says, that both Bernard. in Cantic.
the knowledge of God, and of a man's self, is necessary to salvation. For as
out of the knowledge of a man's self, comes the fear of God, and out of the
knowledge of God, the love of him: so on the contrary, from the ignorance of a
man's self, comes Chrysostom. in polit. lib. 3.
pride, and from the ignorance of God desperation. Saint Chrysostom says,
that knowledge goes before the embracing of Virtue, because no man can
faithfully desire that, which he knows not, and evil unknown, is not
feared. The like song sing all the rest of the Fathers, whose testimonies I
think needless to accumulate, being so well known to all men.

5. And that they may be utterly without excuse, hear Aquin. 12. q. 76. art 2.
what their own Doctors affirm. Aquinas confesses, that omnis ignorantia
vincibilis est peccatum, si sit eorum, quae aliquis seire tenetur. All vincible
ignorance (that is, which may be avoided) is sin, if it be of those things,
which a man is bound to know. But such is the ignorance maintained in the
Church of Rome, not only vincible, but affected, wilful and voluntary.
Bellarmine also acknowledges, that ignorance is a Bell. de omiss. great. and
statu peccat. lib. 6. cap. 8. and 9. Aug. de lib. arbitr. lib. 3. cap. 18.
disease and wound of the soul, brought in as a punishment of original sin:
And confesses out of Saint Augustine, that it is the cause of error. For, Two
evils are brought into the world, (says Saint Augustine) by original sin:
ignorance, and difficulty; from which, two other fountains of evils do arise,
to wit, error, and grief. For ignorance brings forth error; and difficulty,
grief. And our Countryman Stapleton tells us plainly, Staplet. promp.
moral. Dom. 6. post Pasch. text. 5.
that Zelus sine scientia, est vehemens cursus in deui^, in quo quanto curris
velocius, tanto a via aberras longius, and peccas absurdius. Zeal without
knowledge, is a violent course in a wrong way, wherein the swifter we run,
the further woe wander, and sin the groslier. Thus they themselves write, and
therefore I wonder how the same men should dare to allow that which in their
own consciences they condemn; or nourish that in the people, which they
confess to be a sin, a wound, and disease of the soul, and the way to
perdition. I know not how they will distinguish and shift off that saying Romans
14. 32.
of Saint Paul: Blessed is he that condemns not himself, in that which he
allows: unless it be either by saying, that they condemn not ignorance in
all, but only in the Lay people: as if Lay people had not souls to save as well
as Priests: Or that they allow of it, not simply in regard of it self, but in
respect to a further good, to wit, the increase of devotion: as if evil were
to be done, that good might come thereof; which Saint Paul gives a God forbid
unto, and says, that their Romans 3. 8.
damnation is just, that are of that mind. I leave therefore this first
proposition, confirmed by Scripture, reason, Fathers, and their own Doctors,
and come to the second, wherein out of their own grounds, they shall be
convinced of this gross impiety.

6. That the Romish Religion does nourish and maintain Minor.
most gross and barbarous ignorance amongst the people, and take from them the
key of knowledge: First, their own confessions: Secondly, their doctrines: And
thirdly, the fruits and effects of both in the whole rabble of their multitude,
Priests, and people shall euince. For their confession. The Rhemists do
plainly confess, that knowledge in things we Rhem. Annotat. in 1. Cor. 14.
and Luke 12. 11.
pray for, is not required of Christians, but that ignorance is to be
preferred before it: and that ability to profess the particulars of our faith,
is not necessary, no; when possibly we are to dye in the defense of the same
faith. How contrary is this to that which Saint Peter teaches, that eueryman
be ready to give an answer of the hope that is in him? Hosius says, that to
know nothing, is to know all things, and ignorance of most things, is best of
all. Ioh. 17. 3.
How contrary to that which our Savior teaches, This is eternal life, to
know thee, and whom thou have sent Jesus Christ? Hos. contra prolegom. Brent.
l. 3 page 116. St^piyl. Apolog. part. 1. page 53. Pigh. Hierarch. lib. 1. cap.
5. Jacob de Graph. decis. part. 1. l. 1. cap. 26. nu. 34. Antonm. part. 1. tit.
5. cap. 2. 1.
The same Hosius, with Stephylus, and others, commends the Colliers faith to be
the only faith, whereby every unlearned man may try the spirits, resist the
Devil, judge of the right sense of Scriptures, and discern true doctrine from
false, etc. And what was the Colliers faith? Mary, being at the point of death,
and tempted of the Devil, answered, I believe and dye in the faith of Christ's
Church. Being again demanded, what the faith of Christ's Church was, answered,
that faith that I hold. And thus he believed as the Church believed, and the
Church as he, and yet he neither knew what the Church, nor himself believed.
This is a brave faith, and worthy to be canonized to all posterity, for
conquering the Devil. But what if the Devil departed from the Collier, not
because he was scarred with his bugbare faith, but because he perceived him
safe enough entangled in his snare, and so needed not to tempt him any more,
being already sure enough his own? Where was his faith then? Sure I am, it is
far unlike to that faith which the Scripture speaks of, which is often
called by the name of knowledge, and not of ignorance, as Esaias 53. 11. John 17.
3.

7. Again, another affirms plainly, to wit, Linwood Linwood in glos. in c.
ignor. de sum. trinitat.
their Lawyer, that for simpler people it is sufficient to believe the articles
of the, faith implicue: that is, confusedly, and infoldedly, and not
distinctly, and plainly: as a bottom of yarne folded together, which lies in
a small compass, and not raueled out at the length, that it may be seen and
discerned in every part. And their Angelical Doctor, Aquinas, compares
Aquin. 2. 2. q. 2. art. 6.
Gods children to asses, and their teachers to oxen (because it is said in the
first Chapter of Job, that the oxen did plow, and the asses fed by them) and
that it is sufficient for them in matters of faith to adhere unto their
superiors. And in the same place, he concludes, that a man is bound to know
no more explicitly, but the Aritcles of the faith. As for all other doctrines
of Religion contained in Scripture, it is enough to believe them implicitly.
And again in another place he says, that Idem 2. 2. q. 82 art. 3
knowledge does occasionally hinder devotion, and therefore, that simple men and
women, that are void of knowledge, are for the most part most inclined to
devotion. But I confess, he speaks this of such knowledge as is not sanct
fied, but puffs up: how be it he should then have ascribed the impediment of
devotion, unto the pride that accompanies knowledge, and not to knowledge.
Hence grew that notorious celebrated proverb of the Romish Synagogue, that
Ignorance is the mother of devotion. And it goes for current amongst them all,
as yet uncontrolled. But how opposite is the very sound thereof, to that which
holy Scripture teaches, that ignorance is the mother of error, and of folly,
Prou. 7. 7. and of destruction, Mat. 22. 37.
Hos. 2. 6. Thus we have their open confession: and what should follow, but
their open condemnation?

8. But peradventure the Jury requires fuller evidence: let them list
therefore to their doctrines: diverse whereof either directly maintain
ignorance, or at least by necessary consequence drive thereunto: and they are
such, as are not the particular opinions of private men, but the approved
doctrines of their Church; so that a man cannot be an entyre Romanist, but he
must needs subscribe unto them; and subscribing unto them, must also needs
confess, that that monstrous ignorance which is in the Church of Rome, does
issue out of their corrupt fountain. To come therefore unto them.

9. The first doctrine that breeds and nourishes ignorance 1.
amongst them, is their locking up the Scripture in an unknown tongue, that
the common people, being ignorant of the learned tongues, may not be able to
read them, much less to understand them to their comfort: which that is so,
has been partly declared already, and may further be demonstrated: for
Bellarmine affirms, that it is not necessary Bell. de verbo Dei. lib. 2. cap.
15
for the Scripture to be translated into our Mother tongue. And Azorius,
another Jesuit, going a step further, says, that it is Azor. Instit. moral.
l. 8. c. 26.
not expedient for the sacred volumes to be translated into Mother tongues,
because thereby the unity of the faithful should be detrimented, and diverse
causes of errors and heresies would spring up. And Salmeron, a third Jesuit,
descending yet a stayre Salmer. com. in 1. Cor. 14.
lower, says, that the translation of the Scripture should be only
tillinguis, of three tongues, that is, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, in honor of
the Trinity. Or, as another says, Because th^se three tongues were only
sanctified upon the Cross. Hereupon the Council of Trent decrees, the old
vulgar Latin Council. Trident. Sess. 4. decret. 2.
Translation of the Bible to be only authentical, and alone to be used in
all public Lectures, Disputations, Preachings, and expositions. And though
Pope Pius Quartus forbade only (as Bellarmine says) such to read the
Scripture, as had not license Bell. de verbo Dei. lib. 2. c. 15.
thereunto given them by their Priest or Confessor, to wit, such as could
receive no damage, but profit by their reading: yet Pope Clement the eighth, as
another Jesuit confesses, Azor. Instit. moral. l. 8. c. 26.
took away all faculty of giving license to any to read the Scripture, or to
retain with them the common Bibles, or any parts of the Old and New Testament
in the Mother tongues: so that (as woeful experience has taught) it was in
times past in this Land, and is now in those places where the bloody
Inquisition is exercised, a sufficient mark of an Heretic, and cause of fire
and faggot, to be found with a translated Bible in their houses or hands.

10. This is their doctrine, which how it ingendreth and nourishes ignorance,
who sees not? seeing first it locks up the fountain of knowledge, that few or
none of the common sort can drink of the waters thereof: clean contrary to
that famous saying of learned Origene, who compares Orig. in Mat. 4. contra
Celsum.
the Scripture to Jacobs Well: where not only Jacob and his Sons, that is,
the Learned; but also the Cattle and the Sheep, that is, the rude and the
ignorant do drink and refresh themselves: but these men bar out the poor
sheep, and drive them away from the waters of life, to no other end, as it may
be thought, but that they should pine away with thirst, and live and dye in
blindness and ignorance. For if all sound and true knowledge is to be found in
holy Scripture, and therein is the whole counsel and will of God revealed unto
us, so far forth as it concerns our salvation, it being the Epistle Greg.
Epist. 84.
of the great Jehovah to his poor Subjects, to inform them of his will and
pleasure, how should they possibly clime to this true and saving knowledge, who
are debarred from the place and means where it is to found and had, and not
permitted to read this Letter, or hear it read unto them? contrary to that
doctrine of Nazianzene, who says, that all Christians Nazianz. hom. 4. Dom.
Epiphan.
ought to come to Church, and there read themselves, or if they be not able,
hear others read unto them the word of God.

11. If they reply, and say, that it is enough for them to know the Traditions
of the Church: I answer, that if there were as certain ground for their
Traditions, to prove them the word of God, as there is of the Scripture, then
this allegation might carry some show of reason: but the uncertainty, nouelty,
mutability, and absurdity of many of them, do plainly show, that it is no
safe course to repose the strength of our salvation upon them, but rather to
fly to that foundation which is immooueable. If they say, that the people must
be content for their knowledge to depend upon their Priests, and to draw it
from their lips, and so by that means may attain a sufficient measure of
instruction: I answer, that the Priests are for the most part as ignorant as
the people, as shall be showed afterward: and if any be furnished with gifts,
yet they seldom teach the people; and when they do, they preach, in stead of
Gods word, their own inventions, idle tales, and mere tales, and fables:
witness Cornelius Agrippa, Agrip. de vanit. cap. Theolog. Dante. canto. 29.
and Dante their Poet, two no great enemies, but fast friends to Popish
Religion. Now if a man should be constrained to sup up whatsoever every
sottish Priest, or idle Friar, or crafty Jesuit does belch forth, without
examining, doubtless he should suck down much poison, in stead of wholesome
juice. If they say, that there is multiplicity of good Books written to this
end, to instruct the people in the grounds of Religion, and to stir them up
unto godliness and devotion: I answer, there is indeed a great number of such
Books, which are so far from gendring sound knowledge, that they are no
better then baits of Antichrist, serving to allure men, under show of devotion,
unto Idolatry, and Apostacy from God: for if they were sound and true, why
should Gods Book, which without all question is most sound, be prohibited,
and they admitted? Why is it not lawful to examine them by that rule? and why
should all Books else, which any thing make against their Religion, be
suppressed? and by great penalties forbidden? Surely this shows, that all
their Books of devotion are but rotten stuff, and mere hypocritical devices
to deceive the simple.

12. Lastly, if they say, that all our translations are false and erroneous;
and therefore that our Bibles are not the word of God: I answer, that indeed
it is impossible to have a Translation so exact and perfect, that no fault nor
imperfection should be found therein: nevertheless, the chief faults in our
translations are, for the most part, in respect of propriety of words and
phrases, which are nothing repugnant to holy doctrine or good life, and not in
any material or substantial point of faith: and those also are not frequent*
but here and there dispersed, which can no ways hinder the profit to be
gathered by the rest of the Scripture: and if for some corruption in
translations the Bible should not be read, then none but the original Hebrew
and Greek should be in use; for all translations are imperfect: yea, their so
much extolled vulgar, authorized by the Council of Trent, wherein the Divines
Fran. Luc. praefat. in annot. in bibl. Amand. Polan. in Didascal. page 4.
of Louane observed many errors: and Isidorus Clarius, a Spanish Monk,
professed that he found eight thousand fau'ts, though for his plain dealing
he was plagued by the Inquisitors: and after that it was decreed authentical
by the Council, (a thing worth the noting) yet it was corrected and
castigated, by the authority and commandment of six Popes successively. Nay,
the Hebrew and Greek copies themselves should not be permitted; for even
they, if we will believe the Romanists, are full of corruptions: but as Bell*
de verb^ Dei. lib. 2. cap. 2. and 7. Greg. de Valent. analys. l. 18. c. 1.
Pintus. com. in Dan. 7. and 13. Sacrab^s. Ies. in defen. decret. Con. T^i^. p.
1. c. 3* R^emens. annot* in praefat, in nou* testam.
Bellarmine says of the corruptions in the Hebrew text, so we may truly of
the imperfections in our translations, Non sunt tanti momenti, vt inijs qu^ ad
fidem and bonos mores pertinent, sacrae Scripturae integritas desideretur: that
is, they are not of such moment, that they can hinder the integrity of the
Scripture in those things which pertain to faith and good manners.

13. Moreover, besides all this, it is no marvel if they contend for their
vulgar Latin Bible, that it should be only authentical, seeing many Romish
errors are thereby maintained, which in the truth of ye^^^ original have no
color of defense. And so this doctrine does not only uphold ignorance in the
simple, but also herefie among the learned. As for example, to prove the
intercession and patronage of the Virgin Mary, they allege that text of
Genesis, falsely translated, Genesis 3. 15.
Ipsa conteret caput Serpentis: She shall bruise the Serpents head: whereas the
Hebrew truth has most evidently, He, or It, meaning the Seed of the woman,
and not She. Again, to prove their Mass Sacrifice, they allege that of
Genesis 14. 18. Melchizedek obtulit panem and vinum: erat enim Genesis 14. 18.
Obtulit. Protulit.
sacerdos: whereas in the Hebrew text is no word that signifies, to offer: but
to bring forth; and the conjunction causall is also wanting. They extenuate
original sin by the corrupt translation of that text, Genesis 8. 21. For
whereas in the Genesis 8. 21.
original it is, Figmentum cordis est tantum malum: The frame of the heart is
only evil: their translation has, The cogitation of man's heart is prore unto
evil. To prove their invocation of Saints, they object that of Jobs, thus
translated, Ad aliquem Sanctorum conuertere: which in the Hebrew is Job. 5. 1.
not an affirmative proposition, but an Ironical Interrogation: thus: To which
of the Saint* will thou turn? To prove that no man can be sure of the
remission of his sins and salvation, they allege that corrupted text,
Eccles. 9. 1. Nescit homo Eccles. 9. 1.
vtrum amore vel odio dignus sit: whereas in the original, it is nothing but
thus, No man knows love or hatred, all things are before him. That their
Church cannot err, they labor to prove by the promise of our Savior, Ioh.
14. 26. where Ioh. 14. 26.
their translation thus speaks, Spiritus sanctus suggeret vobis omnia
quae^unque dixer^ vobis: but in the original it is, (...), quaecunque dixi
vobis: Whatsoever I have told you. That Matrimony is a Sacrament, they prove
by that place, Ephesians. 5. 32. where their translation has, a Sacrament, for
Ephesians. 5. 32.
a Mystery. So for their Merit of works, they produce, Heb. 13. where, in
their translation, the word Merit is used, which Heb. 13.
is not extant in the Greek. So to prove, that after Baptism there remain
no Relikes of sin, they use that text, Heb. 9. Heb. 9. 28.
28. Christus semel oblatus est ad multorum exhaurienda peccata: now where all
is drawn out, there nothing remains: and yet in the original there is no
such word. Lastly, the Council of Trent it self, to prove that the Church
may dispense with the Sacraments, contrary to Christ's institution, and alter
them, abuses that text, 1. Cor. 4. 1. where the ^. Cor. 4. 1.
Ministers are called, Dispensatores mysteriorum Dei: whereas the Greek word,
(...) imports no such matter. Thus we ^ee great cause why they should stand
upon this vulgar Latin only, because it affoords unto them such pregnant
proofs for the defense of their gross errors. It defends them and their
errors, therefore they have reason to defend it. And thus by forbidding the
Scriptures to be read of the people, they multiply ignorance; and by allowing
only their Latin translation for authentical, they hatch heresy.

14. Secondly, their doctrine which commands Prayers 2.
to be made publicly and privately in an unknown tongue, tends to the same
end: for though, touching private prayers, they agree not amongst themselves;
some affirming, that the people ought not to say their Pater noster, A^e Maria,
Ledes. Ies. lib. de qua lingua. scrip. leg. cap. 3. Rhem. in 1. Cor. 14. page
461. Salmer. com. in 1. Cor. 16. dis. 30. Azor. insti^. moral. l. 8. c. 26.
Coster. Enchirid. cap. 19.
and Mattens in any tongue but the Latin, because this has been the ancient
custom of the Church, as they pretend. Others, that it is lawful to pray in
our native tongues: but yet if we do pray in Latin, it is not unfruitful.
Notwithstanding, their continual practice shows their most approved
opinion: for among them all, you shall hardly find one in an age that uses
any other but Latin prayers: but as for public prayers in the Church, it is
the doctrine of the Council of Trent, armed with a curse, that no part of the
Divine Service and public Leiturgie be celebrated in a Council. Trident. Sess.
22. c. 8. and 9. Bell. de verb. De^. lib. 2. cap. 16
known tongue. Now how can this but noozle the people in ignorance, when they
are taught to babble out in their devotions, like Parrats, without
understanding what they say? Surely this must needs be a blind devotion, and
an ignorantzeale, when the tongue shall pray, or rather prate, and the heart
not understand what it utters: for if true devotion be a religious offering
up of the whole man, both body and soul, and every faculty and part of both
to God, by way of spiritual sacrifice; then certainly that cannot be true
devotion, but blind delusion, when the affection and the tongue shall be
lifted up in prayer, and in the mean while the understanding shall be idle,
not knowing what the affection and tongue does: seeing the proper work of the
intellectiue part of the soul is to know and understand, which by this means
it is deprived of. And this is that which both Aquinas, their Angelical
Doctor, purposely confesses, and Rabbi Bellarmine also himself, though
unawares: for the one says, that he which understands not what he prays,
is deprived Aquin. com. in 1. Cor. 14. Bell. de verb. Dei. lib. 2. cap. 16
of the fruit of his devotion: and the other, that except the prayer be
understood, no consolation at all can be reaped thereby. Ignorance therefore
must needs be cherished by this doctrine, seeing the understanding, which is
the seat of knowledge, is muffled, and the best fruit that can arise hencefrom,
is blind zeal, and ignorant devotion: by which the Act. 3. 17. Romans 11. 2.
Ioh. 16. 2.
Jews crucified Christ, and the Gentiles persecuted the Church of Christ, and
taught, that in so doing, they did God good service: for devotion without
zeal, is like an Arrow shot out of a child's Bow, which falls to the ground
without doing hurt or good: and zeal without knowledge, is like a Ship
carried with full wind and displayed Sails, without a Pilot to stern and
guide it in the right course.

15. Thus for the maine doctrine. Now the accessarie attending upon it, is more
dangerous then the maine it self: for they are taught, not only thus to pray,
but that these prayers are meritorious of salvation; and that he which says a
certain number of them, shall have thus many days, and thus many years
pardon: as 3000. days, for saying a short prayer in the Primer: ten thousand
days for saying five Pater nosters before the Vernacle: twenty thousand days,
for saying Nicol. Salic. Antidot. animae. Salisbur. primer. horae beatae Maria.
Euang. Roman.
a short prayer at the Leuation: yea, a hundred years, for saying our Ladies
Psalter every Saturday: yea, five hundred years for saying a short prayer
which Saint Gregory made; and a number such like, as has been before
sufficiently discovered. Now if pardon of sins and salvation may be merited
by mumbling up every day on their Beads these short and uncouth prayers, what
need any seek for further knowledge in the word of God? If these be
sufficient (as they make the people believe) then all further instruction must
needs be thought unnecessary: and so it cannot choose but follow, that a deluge
of blindness and ignorance must needs ouerflow the world, as woeful experience
has taught to be true in those places where the Romish Religion prevails.

16. Thirdly, they teach, that Images and Pictures are Lay men's Books, wherein
they must read, and with the which they must content themselves, without
searching at all into the Book of God. This doctrine taught Gulielmus Peraldus
Perald. Sum virtut. and vit. tom. 1. cap. 3.
three hundred years since, save that he joined the Scripture and Images
together; for thus he writes, As the Scriptures be the Books of the Clergy:
so Images and the Scripture are the Books of Lay men: where he equalleth a
dumb and dead Picture, to the speaking and lively Scriptures: the work of
man, to the Word of God. But Loelius Zechius, a Loel. Zecchius Sum. mor. Theol.
and cas. consc. t. 2. c. 90. art. 18. Feuardent. lib. hom. page 16. 17. hom. 2.
learned and famous Divine of latter time, goes further, and says, that
Images are the only Books for them that be unlearned, to draw them to faith
and knowledge, and imitation of divine matters. Yea, another Friar, that lives
in Paris at this day, or at least, was alive very lately, goes yet a degree
further, and affirms, that Lay men may more easily learn divine mysteries by
contemplation of Images, then out of the Book of God: and all these are (as
they style them) most Catholic and holy Books. But what should I search
further into these petty Disciples? whereas the grand Doctor himself has this
proposition in express words, Melius interdum docet pictura, Bell. de Imag.
lib. 2. cap. 10.
quam scriptura: A Picture does better instruct sometimes, then the Scripture.

16. This is their Doctrine. Now what fruits does it bring forth? Surely the
best fruit is ignorance, a worse then that error, and the worst of all
superstition and and idolatry: for howsoever, we deny not that there may be an
historical and civil use of Pictures, either to put us in mind of our absent
friends, or to represent some obseruable history and notable deed done, or to
stir us up to the imitation of the virtues of Godly men and women: yet we
constantly affirm, that to make them the Books of Lay men, either to be
instructed by them alone, without the Book of God, or to find better and more
perfect instruction in them then in it, is to inwrap the people in a cloud of
foggie and mistie ignorance, and to hood-winke their eyes, that they should not
see the bright shining light of truth: for where is all sound and saving
knowledge to be found, but in the holy Scripture? whither does our Savior
Christ send his Disciples, but unto them? he does not say unto them, Gaze upon
Pictures, for they be they that testify of me: and, In them ye shall find
eternal life: but, Search the Scriptures, for, etc. And the Prophet David,
that it is the Law of God that gives wisdom unto the simple; and Psalm. 19.
7. 8.
that conuerteth the soul, and gives light unto the eyes: and not the
Pictures of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or of any of the Prophets. And therefore
though a man may be instructed by a Picture, touching a thing done; yet most
certain it is, that more excellent, and more perfect instruction is gotten by
the Scripture: for let an unskillful man return never so often to the
beholding of his Picture, it will always represent the same thing unto him;
and if any scruple or doubt remain in his mind, it can answer nothing for
the explication thereof: whereas in holy Scripture, that which is obscure in
one place, is explained in another; and that which in one Chapter we cannot
conceive, in the next following it may be is so clearly set down, that a
child may discern it without erring: so that as a man may discover his
meaning by signs and becks, yet it is not so effectual as if he utter it by
word of mouth: so Pictures may teach, but yet Scripture teaches more fully and
effectually. And therefore to tie the people to these dumb Books, and
discharge them from searching into the Book of God, is to deprive them of the
chiefest means of knowledge, and so to foster them in ignorance.

17. But yet this is not all. For besides that it occasioneth ignorance, an
Image also is a teacher of lies, as the Prophet Habak. 2. 18.
Habakuk calls it, and a mother, and a nurse of superstition, and Idolatry.
For first, how many Pictures are there in their Churches, of Monsters, and
miracles that never were? As of Saint George, killing the Dragon. Saint
Christopher, carrying Christ upon his shoulder, over the Ford. Saint Catherine
tormented upon the wheel, and disputing with the Philosopher. Saint Dunstane
holding the Devil by the nose, or lip, with a pair of Pincers. Saint Denis
carrying his own head in his hands, being struck off. Saint Dominick burning
the Devils fingers with a Candle, which he made him to hold, will he, nill
he. And an infinite number such like, which either never were extant in the
world, or were not such, neither ever did work such feats as are represented
by their Pictures. Two Pictures I cannot pass over in silence, which I have
seen and observed with my own eyes: the one at the Church of Ramsey, in
Huntington-shire, near adjoining unto that, quondam a famous and rich Abbay.
In this Church, in the lowest window, in the right I Will, is a picture of a pair
of Balance, in one skole whereof is the Devil, and in the other, a woman, and
the woman is more sinful then the Devil, ouerweighing him even to the ground.
Behold, a Lay man's book, whereat wise men may wonder, fools may laugh, and
women may be enraged, and every one may read the folly and prophanenes of
those times. Sure I am, here is little instruction for the souls health. The
other is in the Cloister window of the cathedral Church of Peterborough, where
is painted out at large the history of Christ's passion. In one place whereof,
our Savior Christ sits with his twelve Apostles, eating his last Passover:
which because it was upon the Thursday night before Easter, commonly called
Maundey Thursday: therefore they picture before him in a dish, not a Lamb as
the truth was, but because it was Lent, (O miserable blindness) three
pickerels: so that now the Paschall Lamb is turned into a Paschall pickerell,
and all forsooth, to nourish in the people, the superstition of the Lent fast.
For if they should see Christ eating flesh in Lent, what an encouragement would
this be (thought they) for the people to do the like?

18. And thus Images may well be called Laymens books. But what books, you
see, even such as teach lies, and superstition, and no sound and true
instruction. I could here relate how that Saint Dunstane put life (by a trunk
forsooth) into the Image of the Virgin Mary, and made her speak against the
marriage of Priests, when that controversy could no otherwise be decided. And
how the Image of the Crucifixe Bez. de sig. lib. 14 cap 3.
used to speak to Saint Francis, to the end, to give authority to the order of
his fraternity: and that upon two Images in a Church at Venice, the one of
Saint Dominick, the other of Saint Paul, were written these words: On Paul's: By
this man Antonin. part. 3. tit. 23. c. 1.. 1.
you may come to Christ. On Dominicks: But by this man you may do it easilier:
because Paul's doctrine led but to faith, and the observation of the
Commandments: but Dominicks taught the observation of Councils, which is the
easier way. All this, and as much more might be produced to this purpose. But I
conclude the point with the censure and confession of their own Guliel.
Miniat. Episcop. Ration. Divine. Cassand. consult. page 176.
Cassander, who out of the writings of William Bishop of Miniatum, concludes
with him, that as if officious lies should be added to the holy Scriptures,
there would remain no authority nor weight in them. So, no error nor falsehood
should be tolerated in Images and Pictures in the Church, seeing that an error
not resisted, is received for a truth. And in the same place, the same
Cassander does bewail the abuse of Images in the Church of Rome, affirming
that superstition was too much pampered thereby, and that Christians were
nothing behind the Heatho^, in the extreme vanity of framing, adorning, and
worshipping of Images. Thus far Cassander: out of which we may perceive the
chief lessons that are learned out of these Lay books, to wit, ignorance,
superstition, and Idolatry. And therefore* no marvel if all these vices
reign in the midst of their Church, as plentifully, as amongst the Heathen
themselves.

19. Fourthly, they deliver for sound doctrine, that whereas Saint John says,
that they which have the anointing of the holy Ghost, know all things: He
means not, that every one should have all knowledge in himself personally,
but that every one that is of that happy society, to which Christ promised
Rhemist. in Ioh. ^. 20.
and gave the holy Ghost, is partaker of all other men's graces and gifts in the
same holy Spirit to salvation. And thus whereas Saint John means, that every
true Christian, both by the outward preaching of the word, and by the inward
unction of the Spirit, has a distinct knowledge of all things necessary to
salvation: They say, that it is sufficient, if he be partaker of another man's
knowledge, though he be empty and void himself. Then which, what can be a
greater nourisher of ignorance, and quencher of knowledge? For if I may be
saved by another man's knowledge and faith; And if it be not required that I
should know al things necessary to salvation in my own person, but may have a
share of another man's knowledge, what need I greatly seek for knowledge my
self? And why may I not repose the hope of my salvation upon other men? And
hereby we may observe their gross absurdity, In the case of justification
they teach, that we are not made righteous by the righteousness of Christ,
imputed unto us, though he be the head of the body of the Church, and the
Spirit that animateth it, proceeds from him; and yet here they say, that a
man may be made wise and knowing, by the knowledge of other their fellow
members in the same body, abiding in the unity of Christ's Church. What is this,
but to advance the members above the head, or at least, to forget themselves,
not caring what they say, so that they maintain the cause they have in hand?

20. I, but Saint Augustine says, If thou love unity: for thee August. tract.
in Ioh. 32. Idem in Psalm. 130.
also has he, whosoever has any thing in it: it is thine which I have: it is
mine which thou have. And again in another place he says: When Peter wrought
miracles, he wrought them for me, because I am in that body, in which Peter
wrought them. In which body, though the eye sees, and not the ear: and the
ear hears, and not the eye: yet the eye hears in the ear, and the ear
sees in the eye, etc. Therefore, all the grace and knowledge that is in any
other of Gods Saints, either living, or dead, is ours by participation: And so,
that which was sufficient in them, for their salvation, is also enough for us,
for ours, though we have little, or none of our own. Thus reason our
Rhemists, in the place before quoted. But I answer first, with our reverend,
learned countryman, Doctor Fulk, that Saint Augustine understands that
place of Saint John, of an actual, and personal knowledge, inspired by the
holy Ghost, concurring with the outward ministry of the Church, and not of any
general knowledge infused into the Church, to be transfused, and dispersed
among the members, by an imputative participation. Secondly, if a man may know
by another man's knowledge, why may not a man be righteous by another
righteousness? And if the knowledge of our fellow members may be imputed to
us, that we thereby may be said to know, why may not the justice of our head
be so imputed unto us, that thereby we may be made just? These things are so
parallel, that the one being granted, the other needs must follow. Thirdly, and
lastly, that communion which is betwixt the members of a body, either natural
or mystical, is not an actual translation of gifts from one to another: but
either a participation in the fruit of those gifts, or a generating of the like
in others, by doctrine, example, exhortation, prayers, and such like means.
And so we may truly say, that every one that is in the body of Christ,
reapeth fruit and benefit, by all the graces and gifts that ever have, or shall
belong to any member thereof, though not for merit, yet for comfort,
instruction, edification, and increase of grace. And again, as one candle
lights another, and one steel sharpeneth, and whetteth another: So wisdom
and grace is derived from one to another; either by natural commerce of
speech, or pattern of example. Thus much did Saint Augustine intend, and no
more: and therefore, it never came into his mind to think, (as these idle
brains would make him) that the knowledge which resided in the Saints of God,
is actually in all Gods Children, or that they are partakers of their gifts and
graces, to their salvation. For he that will be saved, must believe for
himself, and know for himself, and live godly for himself. If he do all
these things by a proxy, he must also go to Heaven by a proxy, and not by
himself. This doctrine therefore is a manifest breeder and maintainer of such
gross ignorance, as both Saint Augustine and all other holy men have always
condemned for a sin.

21. A fifth doctrine from whence ignorance springs and arises, is their
prohibiting of Lay men to dispute, touching matters of faith, and that under
pain of excommunication. This Navarre propounds as the doctrine of their
Nauar. Enchir. in 1. praecept. cap. 11. Aquin. 2. 2 q. 10 art. 7. ^ell. de verb
Dei Interpret l. 3. c 8
Church, neither is it contradicted by any other. Aquinas goes further, and
says, that it is unlawful to dispute of matters of faith, in the presence of
those that are ignorant and simple. And Bellarmine takes away from the people,
all power of judging of their Pastors doctrine, saying, that they must believe
whatsoever they teach, except they broach some new doctrine, which has not
been heard of in the Church before. And if they do so, yet they must judge of
them no otherwise, then by referring them to their ordinary Pastor, which is
the Pope, to whose definitive sentence they must yield full consent, without
Idem de Cleri. l. 1. cap. 7.
further examination. Nay, he most shamefully affirms, that if their ordinary
Pastor teach a falsehood, and another that is not their Pastor, teach the
contrary truth: yet the people ought to follow their Pastor erring, rather
then the other telling the truth. And thus the poor people must rely al their
knowledge upon their Pastors, and may not in any case examine and try their
Spirits, whether they be of God, or no, clean contrary to the Precept of our
Savior, Ioh. 5. 39. Search Ioh. 5. 39 Act. 17
the Scriptures: And to the practice of the Bereans, who examined Paul's
doctrine by the Scriptures: And to the counsel of Saint John to all, To try
the Spirits. Now, who sees not that Ioh. 5. 1
this confirms, and cherishes the people in ignorance? For if they may not
dispute about any matter of faith themselves, nor hear others that are learned
so to do, nor examine the doctrine of their ordinary Pastors, but believe
whatsoever they teach, be it true, or false: what remains, but that they
should lie, and tumble in ignorance, and superstition, seeing the ordinary
means of getting knowledge, and finding out the truth, is taken from them? For
when they are bound to swallow down all the doctrines on the one side, and may
not so much as hear, or read the reasons of the other, nor weigh them together
in the Balance of judgment, how is it possible that they should ever find
out the truth?

22. We confess with Saint Paul, that the weak are not to be admitted to
controversies of disputation. But what disputations? Romans 14. 1
Mary, about needless questions, touching matters indifferent, as meat and
drink, and difference of days, as the Apostle explaineth himself in the same
Chapter: Or foolish, and unlearned questions that engender strife, and are not
profitable 2. Tim. 2. 23 1. Tim. 1. 4
to edification. But if the disputation be concerning matters of salvation,
and disquisition of a necessary truth, then are none to be excluded either
from reasoning, or hearing. For Saint Peter requires of every man, that he be
able to give an 1. Pet. 3. 15.
answer to every one that asks a reason of the hope that is in him. And
therefore to dispute: for what is to dispute, but to give a reason? And our
Savior disputed with the Pharisees and Sadduces, in the audience of the people,
touching the resurrection, and the greatest Commandment of the Law, and his
humane, and divine nature. And so likewise did Saint Paul with the Grecians and
with the Jews, conuincing Mat. 22. 23. Act. 9. 29. Act. 17. 17. Act. 19. 8. 9.
them by arguments out of the Scripture, That Jesus was the Christ, and that
there was no way to salvation, but by says in his Name. From such disputations
as these, none was debarred; but every one was, and is bound to seek a firm
resolution, that he be not carried about with every wind of doctrine. True
it is, every simple man and woman ought not presently to rush out into
arguments of disputation, nor too peremptorily to talk of deep mysteries in
Religion: for then it may be said unto them, as Saint Basil is reported to
have Theodoret. bis^o. l. 4. c. 17.
answered the Emperors Cook, Tuum est de pulmentis cogitare, non diuina dogmata
concoquere: It is thy part to look to thy sauces, and dainty dishes, and not
to boil (in thy shallow wit) heavenly mysteries. And therefore, they must, as
Saint Jerome speaks, not lacerare Scripturam, tear in pieces the Hierom. in
epist. ad Paulin.
Scriptures, by their ignorant interpretations, and applications of it: Nor
docere antequam didicerunt: Teach others, before they have learned themselves:
But like Pythagoras scholars, keep silence long, till they be well grounded in
knowledge: nevertheless, all this while, they must not be barred from hearing
others discourse of these high matters; nor from reading their arguments, pro
and contra: nor at length also, when they are come to some perfection, from
arguing, and reasoning with the adversary: For this is the high way to
knowledge and understanding, the Lord having promised to all those that pray
unto him, and do his will, whether they be Priests, or people, the
illumination of his Spirit, and power to discern of doctrines. They that deny
therefore this liberty unto the people, do bar them out from all sound
knowledge, and Ioh. 7. 17. and 16. 13.
imprison them in a jail of ignorance, blindness, and superstition.

23. Lastly, their brave doctrine, touching Implicit faith, does tend to the
same end, and bring forth the fame effect, and that more effectually then any
of the rest. For thus they teach, that it is not necessary for a Layman, to
know anymore, by Molan. tract. 3. c. 27. ant. 15. Bonauent. Durand.
a distinct knowledge, save some few capital heads of Religion, as, that there
is one God, and three persons. That Christ is come in the flesh, and redeemed
us from our sins, and shall com again to judge the quick and the dead, etc.
As for the rest, it is sufficient to give assent unto the Church, and believe
as it believes, though they know not what it believes; yea, that they are not
bound expressly to believe all the Articles of the Apostles Creed, which is
notwithstanding nothing else but a brief sum and Epitome of Christian
Religion, and one of the principal grounds of the Catechism. And this is the
Colliers faith spoken of before, so much commended by many of their greatest
Clarks. Now how can this but nourish most groffe ignorance? For when the people
are persuaded that such a short scantling of knowledge is sufficient, and that
it is enough for their salvation, if in a reverence to the Church, they believe
as it believes: what reason have they either to labor to get any further
knowledge, or to increase and grow up in that which they have attained unto?
Surely, in matters of Religion, so great is the auersenesse of our nature, that
we are all so far from endeavoring to get more then is needful; that few
seek for so much. And therefore they that bound our knowledge within so narrow
limits, cherish this corruption, and by speaking pleasing things unto it, lull
it asleep in the bed of ignorance. But in the mean time, how contrary is this
to the word of God, let the world indge, seeing the Apostle prays for the
Colossians, that they might be fulfilled Col. 1. 10. 11.
with the knowledge of Gods will, in all wisdom, and spiritual
understanding: and that they might increase in the knowledge of God: Whereas
these fellows would have Gods people to be empty of knowledge, and in stead
of growing, to stand at a stay, resting upon the supposed knowledge of the
Church. And whereas the same Apostle says unto the Thessalonians, I would not
have you ignorant, brethren, speaking in 1 Thessalonians. ^. 13*
the same place, of very high and deep mysteries: as the state of the dead,
the resurrection and ast judgment: they on the contrary say to their people,
W^e would have you ignorant, brethren. These things are so gross and
shameful, that if the Church of Rome were not the whore of Babylon, she would
blush, that any such imputation should justly be laid unto her charge.

24. These be the Romish doctrines, which directly, and naturally engender,
and maintain ignorance: and therefore no marvel, if a flood of ignorance
does ouer-flow the field of their Church, seeing it bursteth forth by so many
spowts. Let us take a view therefore a little of the effects and fruits of
these doctrines, both in the Clergy, and the people. Touching the ignorance of
the Romish Clergy, what it has been in former ages, and is yet at this day,
though the Jesuits brag never so much of their new learning, and labor to
wipe away that stain from their faces, let their own writers speak. Platina
the Popes Secretary thus complains of the horrible Platin. in vit. Marcelli.
corruption and ignorance of the Priests in his days: Quanta sit auaritia
Sacerdotum, etc. How great is the covetousness of Priests (says he) and
especially of those that be in chiefest authority! how great leachery, how
great ambition and pomp, how great pride and idleness, how great ignorance
both of themselves and Christian doctrine, how little Religion, etc! I need not
declare, when they themselves do so openly proclaim it, as though they sought
praise thereby. This complaint he makes in the life of Marcellus the first,
and the like in Denis the first: Boniface the fifth: Stephen the third, and
Gregory the fourth. The like complaint or worse, makes one Bredenbachius,
Deane of the Church of Mentz, in Germany, in Bredenbach. in suae peregrin. hist.
the time of Charles the fourth, and year of our Lord, 1370. The Law (says
he) is departed from Priests, Counsel from the Elders, Charity from Prelates,
Religion from Monks, Discipline from Clerks, Learning from teachers, Study from
Scholars, etc. and in the end he bursteth forth into this exclamation, O
times! o manners! most trouble some and miserable times! reprobate and wicked
manners both of Clergy and people! Matthew Paris says, that in the time of
William the Math. Paris. in Guliel. Conquest.
Conqueror, Clerks were so unlearned in England, that such that understood
their Grammar, were a wonderment to their fellows. And for Italy, Espensaeus*
a learned Bishop, faith, that Espens. com. in Tit. c. 1. and 2.
it was told him by an Italian Bishop, that his Countrymen did not study the
Scriptures, but the Civil and Canon Laws, because that was the shortest ^ut
to Bishoprics, Cardinalships, and highest dignities on earth. Touching Spain,
thus complains Aluar. Pelag. de planct. Eccles. lib. 2. art. 20.
Aluarus Pelagius, that the Bishops there committed thousands of souls to some
young Nephews of theirs, to whom a man would be loath to commit two pears to
be kept. And for Germany, let us hear their own complaint, that most usually
Bishops Centu^ grauam. gra. 47.
advanced to the Order of Priesthood, unlearned Idiots, unfit, vile, and
ridiculous persons. The like might be shown in all other Countries: but this
is sufficient for a taste of the miserable ignorance of the Romish Clergy,
derived from their own confession.

25. And therefore we need not wonder, when we read of many Popes that were
utterly unlearned, even so far, that they knew not the Grammar: as that Pope
that said (as it is reported) Fiatur, in stead of Fiat: and being told, that it
was false Latin; answered, that in spite of Priscian, and all Grammarians, it
should be ever after canonized for true Latin. Or that Pope, to wit, Gregory
the sixth, who being Laziard. Epit. cap. 183.
ignorant of Latin, was feign to have another consecrated with him, to help
to say Mass. Or that Pope, to wit, Zachary, that condemned Virgilius, a Bishop
of Germany, for Auent. Annal. lib. 3. Platina.
saying, there were Antipodes. Or Paul the second, that determined all them to
be Heretics, that named the word Academy. Or, Bennet the ninth, who when he
was made Bar^. ann^. 1033 nu. 6. Glab. Rodulph.
Pope, was a child, about ten years old: and therefore could not have any
great store of wisdom in him at those years. And if Popes have been thus
ignorant, which are the heads of the Church, no marvel if Cardinals, which
are the neck, and Archbishops and Bishops, which are the shoulders, and
Priests and Friars, which are but the arms and legs, be void of all
understanding: for how can the members be wise, if the head be a fool? And
therefore when we read, that Lois Marsilius, an Augustinian Friar, being
asked, what the two strops of the Bishops Miter signified? answered, that they
represented, that the Bishop never understood the Old nor the New Testament. We
have no cause to wonder at it: neither when that we read, that a certain Priest
was of this mind, that whatsoever was in print, was as true as the Gospel. Nor
when we hear another of them fishing the Virgin Mary's name out of the first
Chapter of Genesis, where it is written, that God called the gathering together
of the waters ( Maria) etc. Nor another, that proved our Savior Christ to
take away the sin of the world, because the word Jesus was written in Hebrew
with the letter (...), Sin, in the midst. But what need I insist in
particulars, seeing this was one of the rules of a whole Order, called the
Franciscane, or Minorite Friars ^ Nescientes non curent discere literas: Let
not the ignorant regard to know letters. Of which rule they ever were most
obseruant: from whence springs that elegant Epigramme.

Cauisti been tu, ne te vlla occidere possit
Litera: nam nulla est litera not a tibi.
That is in English thus:

Prevented well thou have the letter that does kill:
For not a letter will thou learn, to stop this ill.
26. Now then let* their Bozius upbraid unto us the ignorance of all Arts, and
brag of their Jesuits learning above all others. And let their Posseuine,
and Grester, and Tanner Boz de sig. eccles. lib. 12. c. 12. Posseu. biblioth.
do the same: yet they shall never show a whole Order amongst us, and that of
Clergy men, that make a profession of Ignorance. As for the eminence of the
Jesuits learning, whereof they brag so much, we envy it not unto them, so
that they will not make themselves the only engrossers of learning, but suffer
us, poor men, to retayle some part with them, with whom we may boldly say,
that for number and quality, we have them that are every way equal, if not
superior unto them.

27. But to leave their Clergy, and come to the multitude of their Lay people,
which are they indeed amongst whom we may see the true fruit of these their
doctrines. It is both strange and lamentable to behold the prodigious ignorance
of most, both men and women, that live under Popery, and have received the
mark of the Beast on their foreheads: for as the Priests teach, so the people
follow, like a flock of sheep following their Belweather; the one commending
ignorance, the other embracing it with all their hearts. Some of their own
Writers affirm, that the Common people, for the Vincent. de fine mundi.
most part, amongst them, knew not the Articles of the faith: and if they* knew
not the Articles of the faith, how can they give a reason of them? which Saint
Peter requires of every man. As the multitude of the Nineuites knew not their
right hand from their left; so this rabble know not the right hand of Religion
from the left. As for the maine points of the Catechism, how can they know
them, whereas they are ignorant of the grounds thereof? For the Lords Prayer,
the ten Commandments, and the Creed, they rumble up in the Latin tongue, not
understanding one word what they speak. They say Pater noster, and Credo in
Deum, and yet they know not what Pater means, nor what Credo signifies. Yea,
for the most part, they so mistearme the words thereof, that their language is
more like to the babbling of Infants, or rather the prattling of Parrats, then
the speech of men. Neither is this ignorance only to be found among the basest
of the people, which have no teaching and education, but even amongst the
better sort of them, that are well borne and brought up: and after so strange
and strong a fashion, that by no means can they be withdrawn from this
inueterate and continued custom of their Ancestors. Hence springs all that
gross superstition which is used of them: as, creeping to the Cross, falling
down before Images, adoring and beautifying them with new-fashioned garments,
running a Pilgrimage to this Saint and that, setting up Tapers before their
shrines, wearing about their necks the beginning of the Gospel of Saint John,
as a preservative against the Devil, and the herb Veruine, being crossed and
blessed, against blasts, the white Pater noster, and the little Creed, with an
infinite number of such like superstitious vanities, whereof there is neither
head nor foot. Would any that are not plunged over head and ears in
ignorance, put any affiance in such trumperie? and yet herein is all the
Religion of the vulgar, who repose even the hope of their salvation in these
things, and think it a greater sin to neglect or omit one of these
Ceremonies, then to break any of the Commandments of God.

28. Now let any man judge whether this can be the true Religion, which
nourishes this barbarous and monstrous ignorance and superstition amongst the
people: and whether that can be* a good tree, which brings forth such bitter
and sour fruits. This is the conclusion which grows out of the premises, by
necessary consequence.

The XI. MOTIVE. That Religion which was never known nor heard of in the
Apostles time, nor in the Primitive Church, cannot be the truth: but such is
the Romish Religion in most points thereof: therefore that cannot be the truth.
1. THe Romanists triumph in no one thing so much, as in the antiquity of
their Church and Religion: and therefore they cast evermore into our teeth,
that our Religion is but vp-start, and our Church of yesterday, even since
Luthers time, being never extant in the world before. But herein they play but
the Sophisters: for if they speak of true antiquity, we will join issue with
them in this point, and doubt not but to prove that theirs is the vp-start
Church, and their Religion the new Religion, in those points wherein they
differ from us: and that our faith and Religion was taught and professed by
Christ himself, and his Apostles, and exercised and maintained in the pure and
primitive Age of the Church. For the clear manifestation of which point, it is
first to be observed, that there is a double antiquity; one primary, another
secundary: Primary is that, which was from the beginning, though discontinued
and interrupted by the corruption of times. Secundary is that, which indeed is
aged and gray headed, but yet reaches not to the spring head. Thus our Savior
Christ controlleth the law of Divorce Mat. 19. 8. though it was aged and of
long continuance, even two thousand years old; yet Nonsic fuit ab initio: It
was not so from the beginning: where we see that Divorce was old and full of
years, and yet far from true antiquity: for true antiquity is that which
is derived ab initio, from the beginning. In regard of this, it is truly said
of Tertullian, Verum Tertull.
quod primum, falsum quod posterius: That which is first, is always true, and
that which comes later, is false: but in respect of the other, it is also as
truly spoken of Saint Augustine, Estmos diabolicus, vt per antiquitatis
traducem commendetur Aug. nou. and vet testa. quaest. 114
fallacia: It is a devilish custom, that error should be commended by the
descent of antiquity. Secondly, it is to be observed, that no antiquity, be
it never so ancient and hoare-headed, is to be reverenced or regarded, if it
be not grounded upon the truth of the Scriptures: and that which seems
nouelty, if it bring Scripture for it warrant, is truly ancient, and has
true, certain, and irresistable authority: the reason is given by Aquina^,
Because the Law of God proceeds Aquin. 2. part. quaest. 97. art. 3.
from the will of God, and therefore may not be altered by custom proceeding
from the will of man: whence it is, that no custom ought to prevail against
the Law of God. To which purpose is that of Tertullian, Heresies are to be
convinced, not Tertull. lib. de ^cland. virginib.
so much by noueltis, as by verity: whatsoever savors against the truth, that
shall be heresy; yea, though never so ancient. And of Cyprian, If only
Christ is to be heard, we ought not to Cyprian. lib. 2. Epist. 3. ad
Caecilium.
regard what any before us has thought fit to be done; but what Christ, who
is before all, has first done: for we must not follow the custom of man, but
the truth, of God: and in another place, Idem ad Pompeia. cont. Epist. Steph.
Papae. Clem. Alex. orat. ad Gent. page 41.
Custom without truth, is nothing but antiquity of error. Upon this ground
also Clemens Alexandrinus, in an Oration to the Gentiles, (who pretended
antiquity for their errors, as the Romanists now do, saying, that they, and
their Fathers before them, were borne and bred in that Religion, and therefore
will not now give it over, says, Let us fly custom as a rock, or the
threats of Charybdis, or the fabulous Syrenes, for it Aug. de baptism
paruulorum.
choaketh a man: it turns from the truth, it leads from life, it is a
snare, a hellish gulf, an evil fan, etc. And Saint Augustine, Truth being
known, custom is not to be followed: for our Savior did not say, I am
custom, but, I am truth. Now upon these grounds we offer to join issue with
them: First, that they have no true and primitive antiquity for their
Religion: and secondly, though some of their opinions be of long continuance,
yet being not warrantable by Scriptures, they ought not to prejudice, by a
conceit of nouelty, that primitive and Apostolical truth, which by corrupt
time has been interrupted. And this I hope to discourse so plainly in this
Argument following, that no indifferent reader, that seems not forestalled
with prejudice, shall depart unsatisfied.

2. Concerning the first proposition, I take it to be of an Mayor. 2.
undeniable truth: for, without all question, all truth was taught by the
Apostles to the Primitive Church, and no part thereof was left unrevealed: for
so Saint Paul says in plain terms to the Elders of Ephesus, I have
delivered unto you Act 20.
the whole counsel of God. Now if he delivered to them the whole counsel
of God, then no part of his counsel, that concerned the mystery of Christian
Religion, was vndeliuered. Besides, it is as certain that that Church, which
next succeeded the Apostles, was the most pure and absolute Church, whether for
doctrine, or manners, matter, or form, that ever was in the world: and
therefore to degenerate from that, must needs be, to degenerate from the
purity and sanctity of Religion. And again, it cannot be denied, that though
some heresies were broached, even in the Apostles times, and were coetaneae
Apostolorum, as Tertullian notes: Tertull praescrip.
and though the primitive age of the Church, after the Apostles, was most
pestered with Heretics, yet evermore the truth prevailed, both in regard of
birthright, and predominance. And therefore they that will plead antiquity,
must both prescribe from the Apostles time, and must have a good title also to
hold by: for these two things are necessarily required to a just prescription,
as the Lawyers speak, Bonus titulus: A good title: and, Legittimum tempus: A
lawful time. A good title is that which is warranted by the divine Law: and a
lawful time is that which is fetched from Christ Jesus and his Apostles: both
these, concurring together, are an invincible argument of the truth: The first
proposition therefore must needs be infallibly true.

3. And so I leave it, and come to the second proposition: Minor.
the truth whereof shall be manifested in two points: first, in respect of the
outward face and fashion of their Church: and secondly, in respect of the
principal doctrines, which are proper unto them, as they are the Romish
Synagogue.

3. For the first. The outward face of the Church deuideth it self into three
branches: first, into the persons that exercise preeminence and authority in
it: and secondly, into the jurisdiction and authority exercised by those
persons: and thirdly, into the outward ceremonies thereof. In all these the
Church of Rome is degenerate from the Primitive and Apostolical purity.

4. The principal persons of the Romish Hierarchy are 1.
these. The Pope first, as the ringleader: next, the Cardinals, his
Counselors of state: then Archbishops and Bishops, his assistants: and lastly,
the shaueling Priests his vassals: to which body may be added, as excrements,
an infinite rabble of religious Orders* as Monks, Friars, and He^mits, with
such like: and of Friars, the Dominicanes, the Franciscanes, the Austinians,
the Ambrosians, the Minorites, the Gilbertines, the Crossebearers, the
Cisterensians, the Black, the White, the Gray, the Barefooted, the Begging,
with a number more: and to conclude, the Jesuits, which as they are the tail
of all the rest for the time, so they are the head of all the rest for
vill*nous conspiracies, bloody plots, diuel^ish devices, and hellish practices.
Now of all these (Bishops only excepted) we find not so much as any mention,
neither in the writing of the Apostles, nor in the age next succeeding after
them: for though the name Pope, Papa, being a word of the Syracusan Language,
and signifying as much as Pater, Father, be of great antiquity, yet, as a
Jesuit of their own Azor. Jesuit. Institut. moral. p. ^ l. 5. c. vlt. Masson
praef. in l. 6. de vitis Pontif. p. 271.
confesses, with others, it was a common name to all Bishops, as appears
both in Cyprian and Ruffinus, till Gregory the seventh, in an assembly held at
Rome, decreed, that only the Bishops of Rome should be called Popes. But as
touching Cardinals, the matter is more gross: for the first birth and
original of that name can be derived no higher, then either from Gregory the
firsts time, or Pope Siluester, or Marcellus, Azor. Jesuit. Instit. moral. p.
2. l. 4. c. 1. Polid. Virgil. de invent. rerum, l. 4. c. 270.
or Pontianus, by their own confession: and therefore some of them ingenuously
acknowledge, that the Order of Cardinals is not ex iure diuino, by Gods
ordinance, though others, no less foolishly, then impudently, would fix their
foundation upon these words of the Scripture, Domini sunt Cardines terrae, The
hinges or the pillars of the earth are the Lords. Therefore Cardinals are of
God: which is as good a consequent, as his that would prove, that Heretics
ought to be put to death by Scripture, because Saint Paul said, Haereticum
hominem deuita, etc. as has been showed before. As for the name of Bishops,
we deny not but it is found in Scripture, and so Archbishop may also be
warranted by the same authositie, as signifying nothing else but a chief
Bishop: but how far the Romish Archbishops and Bishops are degenerate from
their office, described by the Scripture, all the world can witness: for the
Scripture Bishops were diligent Preachers, these are idle Prelates: they were
persecuted, these are persecutors: they were humble persons, these are proud
Princes: they were holy men, seeking only the advancement of the Kingdom of
Christ, these are profane worldlings, seeking their own gain, and pomp, and
carnal honors: all this is confessed of them, and lamented by Espensaeus, one
of the same rank, who thus writes, It was no less a wonder in old Espens.
in 1. Tim. digres. l. 2. c. 2.
times (says he) to be called a Bishop, and not to preach, then he is now as
rare as a monster, who is seen to perform that duty: and again, I know
(says he) some learned Bishops, who standing upon their Gentilitie, forsooth,
and greatness, hold it a matter of servitude and baseness, to be exercised in
preaching, because their predecessors were not accustomed thereunto.

5. As touching Priests in the new Testament phrase, all Phil. 4 18. 1. Pet. 2.
5. Reu. 6. 8. 15. 10
Christians are called Priests: and they, whose office it is to dispose the
mysteries of the Gospel, Ministers, and Elders, and Pastors: but now, none may
have that name, but their anointed Shauelings, who (as they say) create their
Creator, by five coniuring words, and offer him up upon the altar, as a
Sacrifice propitiatory for the quick and the dead. For albeit the word Priest
is derived from presbyter, which signifies an Elder, and in that sense might
well be given to the Ministers of the new Testament, yet, because it is in
common use of speech, taken for one appointed to sacrifice, which in Latin is
Sacerdos, and in Greek (...): And because the Ministers of the Gospel are not
once named by these terms in the new Testament, therefore they that in this
signification term the Ministers of the Gospel by the name of Priests,
degenerate from the true meaning of the Scripture: but what should I speak of
the name, seeing the office of these Shauelings is so contrary to that
function which was practiced by the Apostles and Disciples of Jesus Christ? for
the Apostles are never said to sacrifice Christ on the Altar, as these
Shauelings are pretended to do. Their office was to minister (...), but not to
sacrifice; they received of the Lord, and gave unto the people: but these
create a Sacrifice of themselves, and then offer it up to the Lord. Here then
is a plain declining of the Romish Priests from the true Ministers of the
Primitive Church, both in name and office.

6. Lastly, concerning Monks, Friars and Hermites, they are names never heard
of in the Apostles time, nor in the purer age of the Church. The first Hermit
was one Anthony, who lived three hundred years after Christ, who taught others
that state of life, and learned it of none, as confesses Bell. de Monach. lib.
2. cap. 5 Agrip. de vanit. scient. c. 62. Id. Ibidem.
Bellarmine: Monks had no being in the best times of the Church, says
Agrippa; though Bellarmine is not ashamed to say, that the Apostles were the
first Monks in Christianity; who notwithstanding lived not alone in cells, but
went about the world preaching the Gospel, and some of them had wives also,
both which are contrary to the Monkish profession, but Friars are yet of a far
later impressio^. The orders of Dominick and Francis sprung up under Innocent
the third, in the time of the Laterane Council, about the year 1220. For when
Pope Innocent would not be persuaded to confirm to Dominick his order of
preaching Friars, he dreamed that the Church of Laterane was ready to fall,
and that Dominick came in, and with his shoulders vnder-propped it. Upon which
dream he presently sent for Dominick, and granted his petition: and sure not
vain was that dream: for had not Friars been the vpholders and chief
Pillars of the Popes Church, it had fallen longere this. The croutched Friars,
otherwise called the crosse-bearers, sprang up about the same time for Pope
Innocent, raising an army against the Albingenses, whom the Pope accounted for
Heretics, caused the soldiers to be signed with a cross on their breast,
whereupon they were called crosse-bearers, or croutched Friars. All the other
orders of Friars, which amount, as some reckon them, to an hundredth at least,
are most of them of later institution. And most true is the assertion of
Wiclif, that Friars were never known in the world, before the year 1200.

7. The Jesuits took their beginning about threescore and fifteen years
since: For in the year 1540. their order was first confirmed by Pope Paul the
third, to Ignatius Loyola the lame soldier, the chief Father and Patriarch of
that viperous brood, at the request and intercession of Cardinal Contarenus:
so that they are not yet beyond the bounds of a man's age, and nevertheless
they are grown to such maturity of craft and deceit, that all other orders are
but nouices to them: they are the only fellows of the world for subtle
practices, and daring enterprises, and now the chiefest props of the Papal
sea: For Dominick was weary of bearing that burden, and for the ease of
himself, suffered Loyola to put under his shoulder; and so now all the burden
lies upon him: let him hold up stiffely therefore, or else all will go to
wrack.

8. But now to the purpose. Where were all these orders in the Apostles times,
and in the Primitive age of the Church? Then men rejoiced to be called by the
Name of Christ; now these fellows glory to be called by the name of Dominick,
or Francis; and as if Christians was too base a name for them, they will be
called Jesuits, of Jesus they say the Son of God: but more truly of
Bar-Iesus the Sorcerer, that withstood Acts 13. 6.
the preaching of Paul, and was a peruerter of the straight ways of the Lord:
or of a French weapon called Gesu^, wherewith these same bloody Traitors use
to murder kings and Princes, if they withstand their purposes: whereupon is
that elegant Epigram:

-- A Gesis sunt indita nomina vobis,
Quae quia sacrilegi Reges torquetis in omnes
Inde sacrum nomen, sacrum sumpsistis and omen.
9. But to shut up in one word all the villainy of these monstrous late-borne
orders of Friars, let Aretine an Italian Poet describe them. Frate (says he)
in Italian is a Friar: every letter of which word does represent the nature of
that generation: for Furfanto, a thief: Ribaldo, a filthy Ribald: Asino, an
ass: Traditore, a Traitor, and Eretico, an Heretic: All together make the
true and perfect definition of a Friar: Or as Lincolniensis defines him, A
dead carcass risen out of his grave, wrapped in a winding sheet, and carried
among men by the Devil. But my purpose is not to bring upon the stage their
filthy and Clemang. de statu. eccles. page 47. 53. 56. Agrip. de vanit. c. 62.

abominable lives; he that will see that, let him read Clemangis, in his book
of the state of the Church, which he wrote about two hundredth years since:
And Cornelius Agrippa, of the vanity of Sciences: And Polidore Virgill, and
Aluarus Pelagius, and Palingenius, with Ariosto an Italian Poet, etc. and he
shall find matter not only of wonder and admiration, but also of grief and
lamentation, that the Church of God should be so long pestered with such
filthy dregs; but it is sufficient for this place to have shown, that
neither their name nor orders were once heard of in the Primitive Church.

10. Thus much touching their persons. Now for the jurisdiction exercised by
these persons, how not only transcendent, but repugnant it has been, and is
at this day, to that of the Apostles and Primitive Church, their both Lordly
titles, and tyrannous practice does clearly demonstrate. For their titles,
which of the Apostles either assumed to himself (which they might have justly
done, if it had been their due) or received from others these titles:
Universal Bishop, Head of the Church: High Priest of the world: Prince of
Priests, and Christ's Johan. a Capistr. de Papa, and eccles. authorit. Extrauag.
in Ioh. 22. Rod. Cupers de eccles. page 61. nu. 52. Christop. Marel. in Council.
Later. Clement. in Prooem. in gloss.
Vicar upon earth, etc? But the Pope of Rome does challenge to himself all
these, yea, more then these, that he is, as it were a god upon earth, having
fullness of power, and yet more, aeque ac Christus Deus, A God as well as
Christ, a being of the second intention, compounded of God and man, and yet
more, Deus vindictae, a God of revenge, and another god upon earth; and lastly,
Stupor mundi, the wonderment of the world, neither God nor man, but a neuter
betwixt both. Could such intolerable pride ever enter into the heart of a man?
or could the tongue of any wight living dare to belch out such horrible
blasphemies? Surely none but he that is that man of sin, who sits in the
Temple of God, as God, and to whom is given a mouth to blaspheme the God of
Heaven, and in whose forehead is written this name of blasphemy, Deus sum,
errare non possum: Auentin. lib. 7.
I am God, I cannot err. But to the point; Did ever Peter, whose successor
the Pope claims to be, challenge to himself any such titles? or did ever
any of the other Apostles, or any Bishop in the Primitive Church, for the space
of three hundredth years? Peter was so far from this pride, that he gives
charge to all Elders of the Church, that they should not behave themselves as
Lords over Gods heritage. And in 1. Pet 5. 3.
that very place he equalleth himself to the rest, and the rest to himself,
calling himself a fellow Elder: and in another Acts. 1. 15. Acts. 2. 29. 2.
Pet. 1. 10. Lorinus com. super Acta. page 62.
place he calls all the Disciples his brethren; yea, all the Israelites his
brethren, and all Christians his brethren: behold his humility. But the Pope
acknowledges no brethren, but the Cardinals, Patriarchs, and Archbishops:
Emperors and Kings are his children, and not his brethren; behold his pride:
neither did the rest of the Apostles challenge to themselves any such titles of
dignity. For they had learned of Christ their Lord and master, not to Lord it
over others, but to humble Luke 22. 26.
themselves, that they might be exalted. And let them name but one Bishop of
the Primitive Church, that took upon him any of these glorious titles, yea, of
the Bishops of Rome themselves.

11. We deny not, but that some of the ancients have yielded unto the Bishops
of Rome great and honorable titles, but first this was in respect of their
virtue, learning and integrity, and not in respect of any preeminence of
jurisdiction. Secondly, we find none of these titles which I speak of,
attributed unto them, but only the Apostles successors, and Apostolical
Bishops, not heads of the Church, universal Bishops, high Priests of the
world, etc. which the later Popes have usurped. And thirdly, if at any time
they were, yet the same titles of honor which were ascribed unto them, we
Basil. epist. 55 Sidon. Apoll. in lib. 6. epist. 1
find given to other Bishops, as well as to the Bishop of Rome, as to Saint
Ambrose by Saint Basil; and to one Lupus a Bishop in France, by Sidonius
Apollinaris: And to Fontellus another Bishop in France, by the same man: To
Basil by Nazianzene: To Athanasius, who is saluted by the name of high Bishop
and chief Priest: And to Cyprian who was honored with this style, The Bishop
of the whole world. Neither can it be denied, but these titles grew by little
and little to be attributed to the Bishops of Rome, after the first three
hundredth years of the Church, though they came not to perfection till the
perfect revelation of Antichrist, in the Apostolical sea: but this can never
be proved, that either in the Apostles times, or in two hundredth years next
succeeding after, ever any Bishop arrogated to himself, or any other ascribed
unto him any of these arrogant titles.

12. A sufficient argument whereof is this, that Bellarmine Bell. de Romans
Pontif. l. 2. c. 31.
propounding this as his last reason to prove the principality of the Pope,
draws it from the great and famous titles which are attributed unto him, and
spending a whole Chapter in that purpose, alleges not one testimony older
then Damasus the Bishop of Rome, who was elected to that sea in the year 369.
Surely if he could have found out more ancient proofs, he would have after his
manner stuffed the Chapter with them: but in that he produces none, it is
evident that he knew none, and indeed that there were none to be known* Nay,
Gregory the great, one of their own Popes, that lived Gregor. epi. l. 4 c. 32.
and l. 6. c. 24. and l. 4. c. 34 36
six hundredth years after Christ, not only execrated the name of universal
Bishop, which John the Bishop of Constantinople usurped, calling it a name of
blasphemy, and a proud and superstitious title, and him that usurped it, a
forerunner of Antichrist; but also plainly avouches, that none of his
predecessors used that profane denomination: by which the proud times of
Antichrist were marked out. Also Platina, Platina* Naucler* vol. 2 genesis 20
Cuspinian.
Nauclerus, Cuspinian, with many other Historiographers, affirm, that Boniface
the third, and Gregory the second, obtained of the Emperor Phocas, by great
labor, the name of Head of the Church: A strange and tyrannical title, never
publicly usurped, before that time, in the Church of God; but now new created
by Phocas, who having killed his Lord Paulus Diaconus de gestis Longobard* c. 37
Mauritius, and his children, exercised a tyranny in the kingdom of the world,
and begat this tyrannical appellation in the kingdom of the Church. But of
all other records of antiquity, most pregnant is the Canon of the Africane
Council, to condemn the nouelty of these ambitious nominations: of which thus
writes our Roffensis. These are the words of the Council: Let not any, no not
the Roman, be called an universal Rossen^* in consult* Assort* Luther* ver^t*
8
Bishop. For that age (says he) which was near to the Apostolical times,
studied modesty and humility; such a glorious title pleased not that Council.

13. Wherefore concerning these great titles of honor, we may conclude with
our Savior Christ, that It was not so from the beginning: They are new and
vpstart, in respect of true antiquity, ensigns of that pride and arrogance,
which reigned in the Prelates of the Church, in those latter times, Balt.
Castill. lib. ^^^* (...).
and badges of Antichrists kingdom, where at Peter and Paul would blush for
shame, if they were alive, as it was merrily spoken by the Duke of Vrbanes
Painter, when he had drawn their Pictures of a ruddy and high color.

14. But leaving their titles, let us take a short survey of their practice:
And first let it be shown, that Peter, or Paul, or any the rest of the
Apostles, or any Bishop of Rome, or of any other place, did ever take upon them
to depose Kings, and dispose of their kingdoms, and to translate them from one
to another, and to absolve subjects from their oath of allegiance, and
children from the bond of obedience to their parents, to dispense with the Law
of God, to have sole power of decision of controversies, to challenge the right
of appeals from all countries of Christendom: And lastly, to exercise not
only spiritual, but also temporal coactiue jurisdiction. But all this power
has been in former times, and is at this day practiced by the Bishop of Rome,
and that with that rigor and vehemence, that it is a wonder that they do not
blush, so much to degenerat from those, whose successors they claim to be: But
no marvel; for else he should not show himself to be that Antichrist, except
he did advance himself above all that is called God on earth: For this is a
special mark of that man of sin.

15. But let History, the light of time, make clear this Naucler. 2. generat.

point. Pope Hadrian the fourth reproved Frederick Barbarosse the Emperor, of
insolency and arrogance, in an Epistle written unto him, for setting his own
name before his, and checked him also very bitterly, for holding his stirrup on
the wrong side; and when he came unto him in the Church of Saint Mark in
Venice, to be absolved from his excommunication, commanded him to prostrate
himself upon the ground, and then set his foot on his neck, with these
words, Super aspidem, etc. Thou shall walk upon the Aspe and Cocatrice, and
shall tread upon the Lion and Dragon. Did Peter ever do the like? Gregory the
seventh caused Henry the ^ourth, coming in all humility to submit himself
unto him, with his wife and child, to dance attendance at his gate,
barefooted, and bare-headed, for the space of three days, ere he would grant
them any access unto him. Did Peter ever do the like? Celestine the third,
being about to crown Henry the sixth Emperor, set the imperial Diadem on his
head (as some say) with his foot, and kicked it off with his foot again. Did
Peter ever do the like^ Innocent the second caused his own Picture with the
Emperors, to be set up in the Palace of Laterane, himself sitting in his
Pontifical Throne, and the Emperor kneeling before him, and holding up his
hands unto him, as unto God. Did Peter ever do the like? Gregory Naucler. vol.
2. generat. 25.
the third deposed Leo, surnamed Iconomachus, for defacing Images set up in
Churches to be worshipped. Pope Stephen deposed Childerick King of France, and
set up Pipin in his room, for no heinous offense by him committed, but only
because he was in his judgment unprofitable for the kingdom. Gregory the
seventh, called Hildebrand, would have deposed Henry the fourth, and have
advanced Rodolph Duke Auent. l. 5. Vesper. an. 1080 Naucler. gener. 37.
of Sueuia into his throne, but that Gods justice prevented his purpose, by
bringing Rodolph to an untimely end, and the Pope himself to a miserable and
fearful destruction: yet afterward the same Henry was surprised by his own
son Henry the fifth, at the inspiration of the succeeding Popes, and deprived,
and imprisoned, and brought to his grave. Hadrian the fourth discharged the
subjects of William King of Sicilia, of their oath and allegiance, because he
would not yield Apulia to the Pope, for enlarging of Saint Peter's patrimony.

Alexander the fifth excommunicated the Emperor Frederick, as also he had done
his predecessor Hadrian, and thundered out great curses upon him, and sent
letters abroad to all Princes and people, to raise tumults against him, for
punishing some dissolute persons of the Clergy, and claiming by war, some
rebellious Cities in Italy, as they pretended. Innocent Idem gener. 40.

the third excommunicated Philip, and raised up Otho against him, seeking to
dispossess him of his kingdom: and after, when Otho was invested with the
Empire, he set up Frederick the son of Henry the sixth against him, and
deposed Otho. Honorius the third persecuted this Frederick, deprived him, and
stirred up his subjects against him, and absoluted them from their faith, oath
and allegiance: And the like also did Gregory the ninth, and Celestine the
fourth, and Innocent the fourth, against the same man. After the same manner
was served King John of England, by the forenamed Innocent the fourth, because
he banished the Monks that had chosen Stephen Langton to be Archbishop of
Canterbury, contrary to his mind.

16. What should I reckon Raymundus Earl of Toulouse? Or Conrade the son of
Frederick the second? Or Mamphred the bastard son of Frederick? Or Peter King
of Arragon? Or Philip the fair, King of France? Or Henry the seventh, who
being persecuted by Clement the fifth, was at last poisoned Cuspinian. Nauclerus.
in the Eucharist by a Iacobine Friar, suborned to work that feate? Or Jews
of Bauary, Charles the fourth, or Wenceslaus, or George King of Bohemia, or
John King of Na^arre, all which were grievously persecuted, if not utterly
deposed by sundry Popes? And lastly our late Queen of famous memory, whose
life was not once or twice, but often assaulted by the Popes instruments, and
her kingdom, so far as lay in the Popes power, taken from her* and
translated to the Spanish faction? Did ever Peter do the like?

17. But to descend from Kings to Bishop^ the Pope does challenge to himself
the fullness of power over all other Bishops, and that the fountain of
jurisdiction, and the authority of the keys is resident only in his person,
and that all other Bishops are subdelegate under him, and rece^^^ their power
from him, and that they ought to receive their inuestitures from him alone. Did
Peter ever do the like? No: He esteemed all the rest of the Apostles his
equals: and so our Savior Christ enjoined an equality and parity to be among
the Apostles, Mat. 18. 1. Mark. 9. 35. Luke 9. 46. Iren^us l. 5. Cyp. epist.
75. and 69. Hierom. epist. ad Euagrium. Hierom. ad Euag. tom 2. Cypr. de unit.
eccles.
albeit they had a superiority over the seventy disciples* and all Bishops are
the undoubted successors of the Apostles, witness Irenaeus, Cyprian and
Hierome: and therefore must needs have equal power of jurisdiction, as those
from whom they received it were equal: this Saint Jerome avouches in direct
terms, when he says* Vbicunque fu^rit Episcopus, etc. Wheresoever he be
Bishop, whether at Rome, or at Eugubium, etc. he is of the same merit, and of
the same Priesthood. And Saint Cyprian: Episcopatus vnus est, cuius a singulis
pars in solidum tenetur. The Bishopric is one, whereof every Bishop has a
found and entyre part.

18. Again, the Pope claims a Soueraignet^e over a Council, and that not
only to call it at his pleasure, and to dissolve it again when he will; but
also to allow and approve what he lusts, and to disanull whatsoever is
distastefull unto his humorous palate: in which respect it is set down R.
Cupers de Eccles. p. 31. nu. 28 Johan. de turrecrem. sum. lib. 3. cap. 64.
as a ruled case amongst them; that, Although in a general Council, the
universal Church is represented, insomuch that nothing is greater then a
Council, notwithstanding, the Pope surpasses the same in all manner
authority; and therefore if the whole world should give sentence against the
Pope, yet the Popes sentence is to be stood unto, and all other rejected: And
the reason Idem. li. 2. ca. 26
is given, because he is of greater perfection then the whole body of the
Church beside. Did ever Peter do the like? In that Council of the Apostles
and Disciples in the eleventh of the Acts, when as diverse Christians of the
Circumcision contended against him for preaching, and baptizing Cornelius and
his household at Cesarea, which were of the Gentiles, he did not arrogate this
supereminencie to himself, that he was their chief, and head, and therefore
ought not to be called to an account by them: (...) that they ought to subject
themselves to his power, as one that could not err: no, he does no such
matter, but meekly renders a reckoning of his carriage in this business, and
submits himself to their censure. So, Acts 15. when the Apostles, and
Elders of the Church came together in a Council to decide that great
Controuerfie then moved in the Church about Circumcision, Peter behaueth not
himself as a Judge, nor takes upon him any authority above the rest: but as
one of the Apostles gives his opinion, and the determination of the question
is set down not under his name only, but in the name of the Apostles, Elders,
and brethren, that were present; yea, James was president of that Council, and
not Peter, Gerson. tom. 4. in prop. vtilit. ad exter. Schism. Lyr. in Acts 15.
Chrysostom. in Acts hom. 33.
if we will believe Gerson, and Lyran of their own, and Chrysostom of the
ancients.

19. Again, the Pope takes upon him to exempt Clarks, though offending by
Murder, Treason, Theft, Adultery, or such like, from all temporal Courts of
Princes, and punishment of the Laytie, except the Church proceed against them
first, and make them no Clerks. Thus, Pope Nicholas Epist. Nich* ad Michael.
Imper.
the first wrote to Michael the Emperor. Christian Emperors have no right at
all, to make any inquisition for Monks, unless it be in favor to pity
them. Thus Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, quarrelled with Henry the
Second, for this cause principally, as both Houeden, and Fabain report,
Houeden. Hen. 2. Fab. par. 7. c. 237.
for that the King went about to punish such of the Clergy, as were
malefactors, by the temporal Laws of the Land: which the Archbishop utterly
denied to be lawful. For this he said, that if a Clarke being within holy
Orders, were accused of any crime, he must be judged by Ecclesiastical
Judges; and if he were convict, he should lose his Orders, and so being
excluded from Ecclesiastical office and benefice, if after this he incurred
the like fault, then might he be judged at the pleasure of the King and his
Officers. This was that proud Archbishops challenge against his Sovereign*
Henry the Second, for defense whereof, as also for other traiterous demeanors,
being tumultuously killed, he was canonized a Saint at Rome.

20. And that you may see that this practice of theirs is agreeable to their
Doctrine, Bellarmine himself concludes, Bellar. de Clericis cap. 28.
That Kings are not Superiors unto Clerks, and therefore that they are not
bound either by Gods, or man's Law to obey them; save only, in respect of Laws
directive, and that the Imperial Law ought in matters criminal to give place
to the Canon Law: which is as much as to say, that not the King, but the Pope
is the Lord of the Clergy. Did Peter ever do the like? No, he both in his
own person submitted himself to the temporal power, when he paid Tribute at
his Masters Commandment, and when he underwent stripes and imprisonment for
the Gospels s^ke, without making any such challenge of Mat. 17. 36. Act. 4. 3.
Act. 5. 40. 1. Pet 2. 13.
exemption: and also when he gave in charge to all others, even his fellow
Elders, to submit themselves to Kings and Superiors for the Lords s^ke. Sure
it is, that he which paid a Tribute of money, much more ought to pay a Tribute
of obedience: and he which commanded others to obey, would not in any wise be
refractorie himself, lest that old Proverb should be returned upon him*
Phisician, heal thy self: and lest his practice should look one way, and his
doctrine another, which was unfit for any, much more for an Apostle.

21. Lastly, did ever Peter challenge to himself any such power and
preeminence above the Scriptures, as to dispense with, the Law of GOD at his
pleasure, and to take away and abrogate what he list in the same? But the Pope
takes upon him this also: for these be their own positions: That the Pope may
dispense with the Law of God, and Michael. Medina. Christian. paroenes* l. 7.
c. 17 Great. par. 1. p. 76 Abbas Panorm. extr. de diuortijs cap fin. Felin de
constitut. cap. stat. Canon and de maio^^t. and obedientia cap. fin.
against the Apostle, and against the new Testament upon a great caus^, and
that he may take away the Law of God in part* but not in whole. Yea, that he
can ex iniustitia facere iustitiam: turn sin into righteousness: and de
facto. Some of them have dispenst with diverse Commandments of the Law, with
Incest, with Murder, with Theft, with Treason, Adultery, and such like; as
has been before sufficiently declared, and may further be proved, if it were
not a thing both known and confessed. To shut up the point: certain it is,
that Peter never exercised any such Jurisdiction, either in part or whole, as
here is claimed by the Popes: and if he had it* and did not show it either by
doctrine or practice, he was not so careful of the Church of God as he should
be, to hide from them so necessary a truth: but if he had it not, then do
the Popes both unjustly derive it from his chair, and wrongfully usurp that
which by no right belongs unto them. Now in that which I say Peter never did
the like, let Paul and James and John and all the rest of the Apostles, yea,
the whole Primitive Church be included within the same proposition, and it is
as fully true as in that one particular: and therefore it must necessarily
follow, that the Romish Jurisdiction has no footing nor founding in the whole
Primitive Church, but is like a Monster borne out of time, deformed and
misshapen in every part thereof.

22. In the third place, if we consider the outward ceremonies 3.
now used in the Church of Rome, we shall yet more clearly foe their declining
from the Primitive antiquity; for a taste Bell. l. de verbo Dei, cap. ^6.
whereof, I instance first in their Latin Service, which Bellarmine himself
confesses, was not in use in the Apostles times: and Lyranus goes a step
further, and says* that in the Lyran. Com. in 1. Cor. 14.
Primitive Church and long after, all things in the Church were performed in
the vulgar tongue: the same is acknowledged by Aquinas, and Caietan writing
upon the same place, and Cassander as learned and judicious a Papist as their
side affords; Cas. Leiturg. ^8 and penult.
yea, Platina himself points out the very time when, and person by whom this
was first commanded, to wit, by Vittalianus the first, about the year six
hundred, threescore and ten. What need we more to euince the novelty of this
Ceremony, seeing we have so many of their own confessions? and no marvel,
if they confess it, seeing else they should have contradicted most of the
ancient Fathers, whose testimonies are so clear in this point, that they admit
no exception, as the places quoted do manifestly declare. Origin. contra

23. Secondly, I instance in their praying upon beads: which came in, as
Polidore Virgil affirms, in the year of our Lord, 1040. being the device of
one Petrus a French Eremite; but the Rosarie was devised by Friar Dominick long
after: that is, fifty Aue Mary's and five Pater nosters, for which purpose he
framed five and fifty stones* which were so hanged together on a string, that
betwixt every ten small stones, one big one was interposed; and this he
called a Patriloquie. Out of which, as yet a later invention sprung, the Marie
Psalter; for three Rosaries, that is, an hundred and fifty Aue Mary's, and 15.
Pater nosters make a Psalter: because, forsooth, David's Psalms were so many in
number: these* are confessed novelties, and therefore I need not to insist any
longer in them.

24. Thirdly, I urge their festival days, which as they are full of
superstition, so are they of novel and late institution: as for example, the
feast of the conception of the Virgin Marie, not that whereby she conceived
Christ, but whereby she was conceived by her Mother, and also the feast of her
assumption, and of her visitation, and of her presentation: the first whereof
their Jesuit Suarez confesses Suarez in The. par. 3 q. 27. art. 1. and 2.
not to have been clearly known in the world five hundredth years since, nor
received by general consent, till almost three hundredth years after: so that
by his confession it is not much above two hundredth years old* and indeed it
was publicly enjoined by Sistus quartus, Anno 1480. The Sixtus Senensis. Bibl.
l. 2. ^it. Mar^ae tran^it. Baron. annot. 48. nu. 9.
second, their Sixtus Senensis confesses, that it was not found among the
Latin Fathers: and Baronius, that it is not confirmed either by Canonical
Scriptures, or by the writings of ancient Fathers: and in a constitution of the
Council of Mentz, where it is named, this addition is with all sound in the
books of Charolus Magnus. (Touching the assumption of Mary, we leave it to
be questioned.) Now this Council was in the year 800. whereby it is evident,
that all that time it was no public ordination of the Church. The third was
instituted by Vrbanus Sextus, which though Antoninus affirms, was never
received nor kept, yet it was the invention of a Pope, and that of no great
antiquity. And indeed why should it not be observed, if the Pope cannot err?
or if it be not fit to be observed, how is it true, that the Pope erreth not
in defining matters of Religion? The fourth was ordained by Paulus the second,
anno 1466. as they themselves will not deny.

25. Besides these of the Virgin Mary, they have many other festival days, of
the same nature and stamp: as the feast of Corpus Christi, of the invention of
the Cross, of the dedication of Churches, of All souls, and a number such
like: all which are confessed novelties; for in the Apostles times and
Primitive Church, during the space of four hundred years, none of these were
once heard of. The feast of the Po^^. Virg. l 6. In^^^t. c. 8.
Cross was Gregory the fourths invention, anno 828. and Corpus Christi day was
first ordained by Pope Vrbane the fourth, Bell. de Euchar. l. 4. c* vlt.
about the year 1264. as confesses Bellarmine himself* who of his
Apostolical power gave spiritual wages and special pardon to all that should
personally observe the hours of this holy sol^mnity, as at Mattens an hundred
days pardon, at Mass as much, and so at first and second Euen-song, at the
Legend* a^r^a ^^^^or. Sacram.
hours of prime, of tierce, of sixth, of noone, of complete, forty days
apiece: and thus in like manner for the whole week following.

26. The annual sea^ts of dedication of Churches grew from a sinister
imitation of Constantine the great, who because Eusebius. de vita Constant. l. 14
he kept a solemn day at the dedication of a certain Church, which he had
built, therefore it was received as a Law, (for Princes actions are the peoples
directions) to solemnize every year a holy day upon the day of the dedication
of their Church. And all Souls was the device of one Saint Odyll, who as they
write, in Cicilia, in the I Will of Vulcane, heard the voices and howlings of
Devils, which complained with great grief, that the souls of them that were
dead, were taken away Legenda aurea.
out of their hands by alms and prayers: whereupon this feast was ordained,
wherein prayer should be made for all Souls. And as for this, so for the other,
they devised strange miracles to win credit unto them: which plainly argues
their nouelty, in that they stood in need of miracles to confirm them: as for
example, touching the invention of the holy Cross, they fable that it was
first found in Paradise by Seth the son of Adam, to whom Michael the Angel
gave a branch of the forbidden tree, which he planted upon the grave of his
Father Adam, which tree being after found by Solomon in mount Libanus, was
translated unto his house, and there being worshipped by the Queen of Saba,
and foretold to be the tree whereon the Savior of the world should be
hanged, and by which Jerusalem should be destroyed, was therefore taken down,
and buried deep in the ground by Solomon: in which place afterward the Jews
diging a pit for a poole to water their cattle, found this tree, from which
such virtue arose to that poole, that the Angels descended to move the water,
so that the first that bathed himself therein after the motion, was healed of
his disease whatsoever it was as we read John 5. Now upon this tree was Christ
crucified, which being afterward buried again in the earth, was found out by
Queen Helene the mother of Constantine, through the discovery of one Judas a
Jew, who was converted to the Christian faith, by the sweet savor that arose
from the Cross, and the quaking of the earth: and then that Cross was
discerned from the two other Crosses of the thieves, by restoring life to a
dead corpse, whereupon it was laid: and the Devil cried in the air, that this
Judas had betrayed him as the other had done his Master Christ. By these
strange miracles they dignisy that holy feast, and indeed show it to be
nothing else but a mere fable: and forsooth, all this they fetch out of the
Gospel of Nichodemus.

27. So, for the dedication of Churches, they tell us this miracle, that when a
Church of the Arrians was hal owed by Christian men, and the reliks of Saint
Fabian, Saint Sebastian, and Saint Agathe brought into it, the people being
assembled, heard suddenly the fearful gronings and gruntings of an hog
running up and down, inuisibly, and seeking a passage out of the Church, and
for three nights together, ^umblu^g in the roof with an hideous noise; which
(say they) was nothing but the banishing of the Devil out of that Church, by
the hallowing and dedicating of it. Who would not then observe devoutly this
feast, seeing the benefit is so great, that comes by the thing it self,
whereof it is a memorial? But let us leave these tables to their golden, or
rather leaden Legend of lies, as their own Canus terms it, and shut up the
point, that both these here named, and a number such like festival days,
more precisely honored and observed in the Romish Church, and with greater
devotion t(...)n Gods holy Sabbath it self, are new inventions, as sprung up
from superstition, so ordained to maintain the same, and have no ground either
of true antiquity to countenance them, or holy Scripture to uphold them, but
Jewish fables, Apocrypha writings, old wives tales and forged miracles.

28. Fourthly, I requi^e satisfaction for their ceremonies used in both the
Sacraments, as first in the Eucharist: their pompous circumgestation of it to
be seen, viewed and adored, which Cassander acknowledges to have been (
Praeter Cassand. consult. art. 22. Fell de Euchar. l 4 c. vlt. (...). V^g. de
Invent. l. 5. c. 9. Durant. de Kit. l 2. c. 27.
veterem morem and m^ntem haud longo tempore inducta^^.) Beside the custom and
meaning of antiquity, and brought in of late time. And Bellarmine also, to have
been first ordained by Vrbanus the fourth: their mixture of water with the
wine, and separation of leaven from the bread, came both in from Pope Alexander
the seventh, as witness both Polidore Virgill and Durantius. Yea, and
Bonauenture does confess, that Bona. in 4. sent. did. 2. part. 2. dub. 5.
this practice of mixing of water cannot be read of in all the Scriptures, nor
found in the first institution of the Sacrament. Their not breaking the bread
out of a loaf, but giving it in small cakes, Salmeron the Jesuit
acknowledges to be contrary Salmer. fell. in 1. Cor. 10. disp. 17. Suarez. tom.
3. disp. 73. sect. 2 Sal. ibid. disp. 1^
to the ancient practice of the Church. Their dipping the consecrated host in
the cup, Suarez another Jesuit yields not to have been used by our Savior
Christ, and therefore must needs be an Innovation. Their putting the Sacrament
not into the hands, but into the mouths of the communicants, the former
Salmeron does freely confess to be an action contrary to the first
institution. Lastly, their various and ridiculous gestures, murmuring, dopping,
staring, crossing, etc. with the strange garments used by the Priests, in the
time of their administration. Six, of Priests in sign of perfection, because
in six days God created Heaven and earth; nine for Bishops, in token that
they are spiritual, like the nine orders of Angels: and fifteen for both, in
token of the fifteen degrees of Virtues: No man can be so simple, but must
needs see that they were never used by Christ himself, or his Apostles, and
therefore must of necessity be gross and palpable Innouations.

29. From the Eucharist, let us look back to the ceremonies of Baptism: and
first, to their baptizing of Bells, and of Galleys and Ships: secondly,
exorcisme and exufflation: thirdly, anointing with oil, and crossing; and
fourthly, salting and spittling; and lastly, threefold Immersion, or dipping
the Infant: Alphons. de cast. haeres. l. 3
all which are palpable novelties so confessed by the Romanists themselves:
neither can they ever show that these ceremonies were either commanded by
Christ, or practiced by John Baptist, or the Apostles: and though some of them,
as the cross and anointing are of great antiquity, and were then and may be
still lawfully used as things indifferent: yet in their Church, where such an
opinion of necessity is laid upon them, that Baptism is not effectual without
them, they are mere Innouations, no ways warranted by any antiquity.

30. Lastly, I propound as their feasting, so their fasting days, together
with the manner of fasting used amongst Azor. Instit. moral. part. 1. l. 7 c.
12 Sozom. bistor. l. 7 c. 19
them: as first, the Lent fast of forty days, which their Jesuit Azorius
confesses not to be of divine ordinance; and the variableness of the use
thereof does prove no less: some Churches continuing the same full six
weeks, as the Illyrians, Lybians, Egypt and Palestina: some seven weeks, as
they of Constantinople, with the nations adjoining: some but three weeks, and
those dispersed within the six or seven, as occasion served: some again three
weeks, immediately going before Easter: and lastly, some two only, as the
followers of Montanus, all this is recorded by Sozomene in his History: by
which it is evidently euinced, that this fast was no Apostolical institution,
nor yet any child of true antiquity; for if it had, there could not have been
any such variety in the observation thereof.

31. Secondly, their fast of 4. times, commonly called Ember weeks, was first
devised by Pope Calixtus, as would witness Polid. Virg. Invent. l. 6. c. 3
Platina in vita Calixti. fol. 27
Polidore Virgill, if he were not gelded by these strange bookpurgers: but
though he be silent, yet their own Platina tells as much. Thirdly, their tying
of fasts to certain set days, as the fourth and sixth day of the week, was
not allowed in Saint Augustines time; for he thus writes against Vrbicus,
that Aug. epist* 86
strove for the Saturdayes fast: I read in deed that we are commanded to fast,
but which ought to be the days of our fasting, I find not prescribed in the
Evangelical or Apostolical writings: nor in his scholar Primasius his age;
for thus says he, There Primas. in Romans 14 Socrat. l. 5. c. 22
is no Law set down concerning fasting, but as every man can or will: nor in
Socrates time, who lived about the year 440. for he plainly testifies, that
the rites and observations of fasting, were by the Apostles left to every man's
free liberty and choice.

32. Lastly, their manner of fasting, which is, twice to refresh their bodies
on the fasting day at noone, by a small dinner, and at night by a short supper:
Bellarmine himself confesses Bell. de bonis oper. in particul. l. ^. c. 2
to be contrary to the ancient custom, which was, to eat but one meal on
the fast day, and that a supper: and does also give diverse reasons of this
mutatio^: As first, that though it be tolerated in their Church, yet it is not
commanded: Secondly, that those customs which are not grounded upon Gods word,
may by ecclesiastical Laws be varyed according to the diversity of time and
place: and thirdly, that when the ancients broke off their fast at the ninth
hour, they used to dyne at the sixth, that is noone; and therefore when as many
do ordinarily dyne at the third hour, they may by like proportion break off
their fast at the sixth: these be Bellarmines reasons to maintain this
Innovation: whereby we may both behold what silly props he has to uphold his
rotten cause, and also that by his own confession this is a mere nouelty; and
therefore he concludes, that notwithstanding these forenamed reasons, yet they
do better, who after the ancient custom eat nothing till the ninth hour,
and in Lent till the evening. And thus we see how in the principal ceremonies
of their Church, they have degenerate from the usage and custom of all pure
antiquity.

33. Thus much of the outward face of their Church: Now let us examine a little
their doctrines, wherein they differ from us, which are the sinews and nerves
thereof: and here I might refer the Reader over unto our learned and godly
Countryman Doctor White, lately deceased, who in his highway to the true
Church, obiecteth eight points, wherein the modern Church of Rome has varyed
from that which formerly was maintained: notwithstanding I will also a little
touch upon the same strings, adding somewhat more both in points and proofs,
then is there delivered* that the Reader may have also here some satisfaction
concerning these matters.

34. First therefore it is an article of the Romish faith, that Council. Basil.
sess. 36 Council. Trid. sess. 5. and 6 Sixth. 4. c. cum praeexcelsa. Salmer.
Jesuit. Com. in Romans 5 Disp. 4^
the Virgin Mary, whom we honor as a blessed woman, and the mother of our
Lord, was conceived and borne without the stain of original sin. This
doctrine was decreed (...) an article of faith in the Council of Basil, in
the year 1431. and afterward was approved by the Council of Trent, and by
Pope Sixtus the fourth: yea, and all that take any degree in the profession of
divinity in the university of Paris, first, swear that they will defend this
prerogative of the Virgin Mary. Now that this is a nouelty, appears, first
because it was not received as an article of faith, before the Council of
Basil: Secondly, because the Fathers generally, either utterly Chrysostom. in Mat.
hom. 45. and in Ioh. him. 20 Bernard. epist. 174
deny it to be a truth, or at least doubt of it. Saint Chrysostom s^^tly
denies it. Saint Bernard calls it in plain terms, a nouelty. Caietane
reckons fifteen fathers to have been of a contrary opinion, others two
hundredth, others three hundredth, as witnesses Salmeron the Jesuit; and
lastly, Salm. Ies. com. in Romans 5. disp. 51 Can. loc. l. 7. c. ^ and 3 Dom.
Bannes. part. 1. in Tho. q 1. art 8. dub. 5 Turrecrem. de consec. d. 4. nu. 2
Salm. quosupra. Bell. de amiss. great. and stat. pec. l. 4. c. 15
Canus peremptorily affirms, that all the Fathers contradicted it. And it is
to be noted, that whereas Bellarmine produces twelve Fathers for the proof
thereof, not one of them do directly affirm it, except one or two. Thirdly,
because the Elder Schoolmen with one consent disapprooued it, as Dominicus,
Bannes, Turrecremata, Thomas Aquinas, Bonauenture and others, in so much that
in this point they are driven to this gross shift That younger divines are more
apprehensiue of truths, then were the more ancient Doctors. Bellarmine, I
confess, in this point accuses us of slendering their doctrine, because he
says it was never held in their Church as an article of says, as we say it
is: but by his leave, if it was the decree of one Council, though not
confirmed by the Pope, as he says the Council of Basil was not, and was
allowed by another Council confirmed by the Pope, to wit, the Council of
Trent, as an holy opinion, and agreeable to the Catholic faith, and approved
by diverse Popes, as he confesses, and defended generally in their Church, not
only by doctrine, but by a solemn observation of a festival day in memorial
thereof: then surely it cannot be less then an article of their faith: or if
that term mislike him, a general Romish opinion, which is enough for our
purpose.

35. Again, it is another article of the Romish faith, that 2.
divine service should be in the Latin tongue: this to be contrary to all
antiquity, I have already declared a little before, and therefore I think it
not needful here to repeat it; only this is to be marked, that till the
Pope of Rome began to show himself to be Antichrist, that man of sin, the
mystery of whose name is the number 666. which according to Irenaeus conjecture
is (...). Till then (I say) this Latin service was not publicly received, but
ever since; as if the Pope would discover himself to be that enemy, pointed
at by Council. Trid. sess. 22. c. 8. and 9
that Prophecy, he will have all the prayers of the Church to be Latin, and
has fixed an Anathema upon every one that shall dare to affirm the contrary.

36. Again, it is another doctrine of the Romish Religion, 3. Index l. prohib.
edit. a Council. Trid. reg. 4.
that the Lay people may not read the Scriptures, nor keep them in their
mother tongue: which to be contrary to the ancient custom of the Church,
three reasons demonstrate. First, their own confession; for Azorius the Jesuit
confesses, Azor. Ies. Instit. mor. p. 1. l. 8. c. 26 Bell. de verbo di. l. 2.
c. 15 Azor. quo supra c. 28 Ledes. Ies. l. de divine. scrip. c. 31 nu. 4
that the Scriptures in the Primitive Church were to be published throughout
all nations, and therefore were made common by the three most common and famous
languages: and again, We confess (says he) that in Jerome and Chrysostomes
times, the Lay people were exercised in reading the Scriptures, because they
were written in those languages which they understood. And Ledesima another
Jesuit, that the Bible was translated into the Latin tongue presently after
the Apostles times, and that to this end, that all might understand the
Scriptures. And Espensaeus says, Espens. com. in Tit. c. 2
that it is manifest by the Apostles doctrine, Col. 3. 16. and by the practice
of the Church, that the public use of reading the Scriptures, was then
permitted to the people. And further, that the Jews instructed their children
at five years of age in the Scriptures, and therefore that Christians might
be ashamed to be careless therein: and this (he says) was not only his
complaint, but the complaint of the ancient Fathers. And lastly, Cornelius
Agrippa affirms, that it was a decree in the Nicene Council, Agrippa de
vanitate c. 100
that no Christian should be without a Bible. Thus we have a quadron of their
own Doctors, acknowledging this to be a nouelty.

37. Secondly, the general consent of the Fathers demonstrate the same: for
the Council of Nice* as it is alleged before out of Agrippa decreed, that no
Christian should be without a Bible: and Saint Augustine allows the use of
the Scriptures Eder. O^conom* b. bl l. ^. p. 52
to all, when he says, that they are not so hard, but that every one by his
study and diligence, may attain to so much knowledge in them, as shall further
him in his salvation: and Chrysostom in many places exhorts all, both men
and women, Chrysostom. hom. 3 de Laza^o, and 9 in epist. ad Colos. and hom. 2. in
Mat. and 10. in Ioh. Hierom. in Nahum. c. 3 Idem in Psalm. 86
learned and ignorant, yea very tradesmen to get Bibles, and to read them; for
though they understand not what they read, yet they gain to themselves some
sanctity by the reading of them. And Jerome persuades not only men, but
women, to fly to the mountains of the Scriptures, saying, that though there be
none to teach them. yet their endeavor shall be accepted of God: and in
another place he says, that Plato wrote not to the people, but to a few, for
scarce three understand his works: but Christ our Lord wrote by his Apostles,
not to a few, Orig. in Mat. 4. and contra Celsum.
but to the whole people. Origin compares the Scripture to Jacobs Well,
wherein drink not only Jacob and his children, that is, the learned; but the
sheep and oxen, that is, the rude and simple. Nazianzene affirms, that
Christians ought to read the Nazian. hom. 4 Dom. Epiphan.
Scriptures, or if through ignorance they cannot, then they must give ear to
others. Many other testimonies I could allege; but these are I think
sufficient to show, that in the age when these holy men lived, this doctrine
was never hatched, nor heard of, and therefore must needs be an addle egg of a
later layer.

38. Thirdly, and lastly, the manifold translations of the Bibles into sundry
languages proves the same; for to what end were they translated, if they might
not be read? This Saint Augustine Aug. de doctrine. Christ. l. 2. c. 5
affirms, when he says, that the holy Scripture proceeding from one tongue,
being through the diverse tongues of interpreters, far and wide dispersed
abroad, became known to the Gentiles to their salvation. And Theodoret as
plainly. The Theod. l. 5. de corrig. Gentium affecti^us.
Hebrew books were translated into all languages, which are at this day used
in the world. Chrysostom is confessed to have translated some parts of the
Scriptures into the Armenian tongue: and Vlphias into the Gothicke; Charles the
fifth caused them to be translated into the French tongue: and Charles the great
into the Germane: and Alfred, king of this Island, the Guliel. de Reg: Angliae.
Psalter into the English tongue: and at this day the Moscouites, Armenians,
Egyptians, and Ethiopians, have their public prayers and Scripture in their
vulgar and known tongues. Now these ancient translations do evidently prove
this Romish doctrine to be an Innovation.

39. Again, it is another doctrine in the Romish faith, that 4. Council. Trid.
scss. 24. Cassand. consult. art. 23. Turria Jesuit. de dogmat. charact. l. 2.
^quin. 2. 2. q. 88 ar^. 2.
Priests and Ministers of the Gospel ought not to marry, and that marriage is
an inseparable impediment to holy orders: some of them most grossly affirming,
that the vow of single life is so essential to Priesthood, even by the Law of
God, as that it is no more lawful for any person to permit the Clergy to
marry, then to license a man to steal. But they which speak more remissely,
say, that though it be a positive Law; yet it is Apostolical, and therefore
ought to be observed in the Church, inuiolably; and the reason is given by
Bellarmine; Bell. de Cler. l. 1. c. 18. and 19.
Because great purity and sanctity is required in the office of sacrificing,
but in the act of marriage, there is mixed a certain impurity and pollution,
which though it be not sin, yet it proceeds from sin, and makes a man
carnal, and so unfit for divine offices.

40. This is their doctrine, which to have no ground in Gratian. Cause. 26. q.
2. Can. Sa^. 5.
true antiquity: first their own confessions bear witness: and secondly, the
light of history. For their confessions: one of them says, that marriage of
Priests is not prohibited, either by Legal, Evangelical, or yet Apostolical
authority, but by Ecclesiastical only: another, that many hundredth years
after the Apostles, Espens. Com in Tit. c. 1.
by reason of want of others, Priests were married: another, that if we
exclude the Church Laws, and stand only to that which we have from Christ,
it cannot be proved by any reason or authority, that speaking absolutely, a
Priest sins in Caietan. tom 1. tract. 27. Scot 4. d. 37. Polid Virg. Invent.
l. 5. c. 4. Coster. E(...). page 317. Paypus. Index ex^u^g. col. ^^8. Epiphan.
de ^. ^. res l. 1.
marrying, or that holy order is an hinderance to marriage, either as it is an
order, or as it is holy: others, that in the most ancient times of the Church,
and after the Apostles deaths, Priests had their wives. And lastly, their own
gloss and marginall observation upon the same, (though they be now both made
dumb by their expurging Index) speak as much: for in them we fiude this
proposition: Anciently Priests were permitted to marry.

41. For history, to omit the Priests and Prophets of the old Testament: Peter,
whose successors they claim to be, carried a wife about with him in his
preaching, which was put to death at Antioch, for consessing lesus Christ, as
witness both Clemens Alexandrinus, and Eusebius: which writers do Clem. Alexand.
s^^^m. l 7. Eusch. eccl. hist. l. 3. c. 30. Acts 21. 9.
also affirm that Paul had a wise also, and left her at Philippos, a City of
Macedonia, that he might with less cumbrance, preach the Gospel abroad. That
Philip the Euange list was married, Saint Luke testifyeth in the Acts of the
Apostles, for it is said there, that he had four daughters which were
Prophetisses: thus was it in the first age of the Church: then afterward

we read, that Hilary a French Bishop was married: and of Saint Basils Father,
that he was a Bishop, and in the state of marriage held that function: and the
like of Synesius the Bishop of P^olomais: and Athanasius reports that Bishops
and Monks lived married, and had children: and Eusebius, that in the Eastern
Churches it was counted a yoke too heavy to be borne, to bind Churchmen from
marriage: yea Gratian boldly affirms, that except they will brand some of the
Popes with bastardy, and adultery, they must confess that Bishops were and
might then be married: for Gregory the first was grandchild to Pope Felix the
third: and Alexander the sixth had two sons, begotten of his own body: and
Boniface, Felix, Gelasius, and Agapetus were all sons of Bishops: yea their
own Vicelius reckons up a number both of Bishops and Priests, that in the
Primitive Church were married. In brief, though in all ages the Devil by his
instruments labored to bring disgrace upon Gods holy ordinance of marriage,
and by that means to make way to adulteries, fornications, and unlawful
lusts; and some learned and godly fathers were too lavish in commending
virginity before marriage; yet they were always gainsaide by other some as
learned and godly as themselves, who^ God stirred up for the desence of his own
ordinance: neither was it ever propounded as a Law, until Pope Siricius time,
who was the first that forbad, and interdicted Priests to marry; and afterward
Pope Nicholas the first, or as some think, the second, about the year 867,
did the like; against whose proceedings Haldericus the Bishop of Ausbrough,
wrote that learned and pithy Epistle, where of mention is made before: and yet
it was not universally received, until the time of Pope Calixtus, about the
year 1108. History is so clear for this matter, that it admits no just
exception: and thus both by their own confessions, and by the light of
history, this doctrine is convinced of nouelty.

42. Another article of the Popes Creed is concerning Images, 5. Council. Trid.
sess. 25. Bell, de Imag. l. 2 Azor. Instit. mor. Vasques. Ies. de adorat. lib.
to wit, that God himself may be represented by, and worshipped before an
Image; and that the Images of Christ and the Saints are to be adored with the
same worship which is due unto their p^tternes: or at least wise that they are
to be worshipped in or at the Image: This is the general doctrine of that
Idolatrous Church: which that it has no true warrant from antiquity, is so
clear, that none that is but meanly seen in ancient writers, can doubt
thereof. For first, in the Church of the Jews it was unlawful either to make
any Image of God, being an invisible, and incomprehensible essence, or to
worship the Image of any other thing whatsoever: this was the prescript of the
second Commandment, which was no ceremonial Law: As Azorius and Vasques, two
Azor. Inssit. mor. p. 1 l. 9. c. 6. Vasq. Ies. de ad. r. l. 2. d^st. 4. c. 4.
Bell. de Imeg. l. 2. c. 7. Aug. de ciuit. l. 4 I^s^ph. A^tiq. l. 18. c. 2.
Jesuits, have not ashamed to auerre: but moral and natural, as the grand
Jesuit Bellarmine confesses, and may be further confirmed by the sentence of
Varro, alleged by Saint Augustine in his fourth book de Ciuitate: who says,
that the Jewish nation worshipped God without any Image, and that they had no
Image in the Temple ordained for worship. Also Josephus does write, that when
Caius the Emperor would have caused his statue to have been set up by
Petroni^s to be worshipped in the Temple of Jerusalem, the Jews had rather
expose themselves to present death, then to admit that which was forbidden by
the Law.

43 Secondly, in the age of Jesus Christ, and the Apostles, there was no
precept nor example for the worshipping of Images, nei. her did they commend
unto the Lay people Images and Pictures, as fittest books for their
capacities, but the word preached and committed to writing, by which they
should be brought to salvation. And when as they abolished the worship of
Idols, and brought in the worship of the true God, we do not read, that
either they translated those Idolatrous statues to the worship of the true God,
or substituted other Images of God himself, for of holy men to succeed in
their room; but taught that God who is a Spirit, ought to be worshipped in
Spirit and truth. Now surely if it had been so necessary as the Church of Rome
makes it, our Savior Christ and his Apostles would never have concealed it
from them.

44. Thirdly, the age also after the Apostles, was free from Images: for
amongst those Ecclesiastical rites, which are recorded to have been used in
the first 300. years after Christ, there is not so much as any mention made of
Image Worship, Theodor. de haeres. l. 1.
except it be amongst those that were condemned for Heretics: as the
followers of Simon Magus, who worshipped his Image, and of his harlot Selene;
and the Disciples of Basilides, whom Irenaeus affirms to have used Images,
and Iren. l. 1. c. 23.
Inuocations: and the Carpocratians, and Gnostics, who burned incense to the
Images of Christ and Paul, Homer and Pithagoras, etc. as testifyeth Saint
Augustine: but the true Aug. de haeres.
Church of God condemned these, and abhorred all such kind of worship; and
therefore amongst the accusations which the Heathen objected to Christians in
that age, this was one, that they professed a Religion without Images, as
witness both Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origin; the one whereof lived Clem.
Alexand. strom. l 6. Origin. contra Celsum.
200. years after Christ, and the other 240. which truth their Cassander
confesses in direct words, that at the first preaching of the Gospel, there
was no public use of Images in the Church.

45. Fourthly, in the next age of the Church, after the three hundredth year
that Images were not approved, we have the witness of the Council of
Eliberis, which decreed Council. El. ber. ^n 38. solid. Virg. l. 6. ^. 13.
Origin. contra Celsum. l. 7.
that no Image should be made in the Church, lest that should be adored which
is painted on walls: and of Jerome, who affirmed that it was condemned of all
ancient Fathers: and of Origin, who called that worship, a foolish and
adulterous profanation: and of Epiphanius, who finding a painted Image in a
Church, rent it Epiphan. epist. ad Joan.
down, and said that it was against the authority of the Scripture, that any
Image should be in the Church: and of Augustine, who Aug in Psalm. 114 and
epist. 119. ^ Cassand. consult. art. 21.
condemned the use of them in Churches as unlawful: and lastly, of Gregory
their own Pope, who allowing only an historical use of them, forbad them to
be worshipped: as testifies Agrippa. Indeed we confess that there was in
these Agrip. de vanit. c. 70.
Primitive times of the Church, an historical use of Images: as may appear by
that statue of our Savior at Cesarea, mentioned by Eusebius: and the Pictures
of Peter and Paul in the Eusebius. l 7. c. 14.
same author: and of the good shepherd seeking the lost sheep, painted upon
their Chalices, in Tertullian. But we Tertul. lib. de pudicitia.
shall never find in any good author, that either they were received into
Churches, or worshipped in any religious manner.

46. Lastly, it is a known and confessed truth, that Images were never
generally received and enjoined upon the Church, until the second Nicene
Council which was eight hundredth years after Christ: and also that the decree
of that Council was abrogated by another Council held at Frankeford, not long
after; so that it is manifest, that the petigree of this bastard is of no great
continuance, not fetched from the Primitive Church, which is the thing we have
in hand to prove, but springing up in the more corrupt times, when
superstition had darkened the light of true Religion, and almost banished it out
of the world.

47. Another article of their Religion is, that the Pope has 6.
a supremacy of power over all, even Princes, not only in spiritual matters,
but even in temporal: which to be a late device, not warrantable by true
antiquity, may be easily demonstrated. For upon those words of Saint Paul, Let
every soul Chrysostom. and Oecumen. in epist. ad Romans c. 13. Aeneas Syluius in
gest. council. Basil. Espens. in tit. c. 3.
be subject to the higher powers. Chrysostom and Occumenius write thus: That
whether it be a Priest, or a Monk, or an Apostle, he must be subject to the
civil Magistrate: for this subjection does not overthrow piety: and if an
Apostle, then the Pope: as Aeneas Siluius who was after a Pope himself,
infers: yea Espensaeus goes further, and says, that not only Chrysostom,
but Theodoret, Theophilact, and all the Greek Doctors: and in the Latin
Church, Saint Gregory, and Saint Bernard did from that place teach, that eueryl
Apostle, and Prophet, and Priest, was commanded to acknowledge subjection unto
Emperors. Saint Ambrose says plainly, that Ambros. orat in Auent. Aug.
confess. l. 3. c. 8.
the Church lands, and Church men themselves did pay tribute to the Emperor;
and if tribute, then subjection: Saint Augustine says, that it is generale
pactum societatis humanae, abedire Regibus suis: The general covenant and bond
of humane society, to obey Kings. If the Pope then be a man, by Saint
Augustines Gregor. l. 2. Indict. 11. c. 100.
rule, he must be subject: yea Gregory the first himself avouches plainly,
that power over all men is committed by GOD, Dominorum meorum pietati, to the
piety of my Lords: where he not only subiecteth all, none excepted to the
Imperial power: but also calls the Emperor his Lord: but now the Pope is
the Emperors Lord, and not the Emperor Bell. de Cleric. c. 28.
the Popes, as Bellarmine speaks without blushing, when he says, Non sunt
amplius Reges Clericorum superiores, etc. Kings are not any longer superiors
to Clerks: and therefore Clerks are not bound to obey them by Gods Law: and
thus in general, the Pope had not this supremacy, till Gregory's time.

48. For particulars, one part of this supremacy is, that the Pope is
absolutely above a Council, which notwithstanding Cusan. l. 2 concord. c. 17.
was condemned by the Councils of Constance, and Basil. And as Cardinal
Cusanus confesses, was not acknowledged in the days of Saint Augustine: Pope
Gregory, and other Fathers and Councils, which lived before the first six
hundredth year. Another part is, that appeals should be made to the Pope from
all places, which the Councils of Chalcedon, Afric, Mileri, and
Constantinople utterly withstood and interdicted. A third is, that peculiar
cases of conscience should be reserved to the Popes consistory, which their
own Salmeran confesses Salmer. in 1. Pet. 5. disput. 8.
to have not been used in the time of Cyprian, who lived two hundredth and
forty years after Christ. A fourth is the claim of Inuestitures, which by
consent of history was Malms de gest. Reg. Angl. l. 3.
brought in first by Pope Hildebrand, as witness Malmsbury, Nauclerus,
Sigibert with others. A fifth, authority to depose Naucl. 2. geacr. 36.
Sigebert, an. 774 Barclau^ contra monarch. l. 6. c 26. Espens. in Tim. l. 2.
Plat. Greg. 3.
and molest Princes, which no Orthodoxall Father for the space of 1000. years,
taught or approved, as says their own Barclay; and the first Pope that
practiced this, was Hildebrand, surnamed Gregory the seventh, as witnesses
Espensaeus; or at the highest Gregory the third, who attempted this rebellious

pleasure, both which are notorious novelties: for the first eight general
Councils were called by Christian Emperors, and the decrees of Councils were
of so sacred authority, that the better sort of Popes in the purer times, put
great Religion in changing them, or varying from them in any respect: witness
Aeneas Siluius, Victorine, and Cardinal Cusanus. Lastly, a seventh, the
fountain of Episcopal Jurisdiction, challenged to reside in the Pope alone,
and from him to be imparted to other Bishops at his pleasure, which was a
doctrine not known in Saint Cyprians time, nor in Saint Ieromes as has been
showed before. In a word there is no color of antiquity for any part of this
transcendent Jurisdiction, and yet the very soul and life of Popery consists
therein.

49. Of the same stamp is their doctrine of receiving the 7.
Sacrament under one kind, and withholding the cup from the peoples this was
first decreed by the Council of Constance, and afterward established by the
Trent conuenticle, and has ever since been practiced in the Church of Rome,
under pain of excommunication. But that it is a gross innovation, we Council.

need no further testimony then of the two foresaid Councils, the one whereof
says, that in the Primitive Church both kinds were received, and that this
custom of one kind only came afterward in: and the other strikes with
anathema, all them that shall say that the Catholic Church has not altered
this custom upon just causes: by which words it confesses, that there is an
alteration of ancient custom; now what the causes were of this alteration, I
will not here report, let the Reader behold them in Bellarmine, Gerson and
Lyranus, and wonder that Christ's ordinance, and the general custom of the
primitive Church should be altered and annihiled upon so slight, frivolous and
foolish grounds: add unto these Councils the wirnesse of their own Cassander,
who directly affirms, that Cassand. consult. art. 22.
this custom of communicating under one kind, invaded not the Latin Church,
until the year of our Lord, 1300. To the same purpose might be alleged
their own ancient Lyturgies, the decrees of their own Popes, and the general
doctrine of their school, and lastly, the consent of Fathers, all which do
most clearly prove this doctrine to be a nouelty, if not an heresy: Lyturg.
Mar. page 62. Conslit. Clement. page 145.
Their Lyturgies are plain, that the cup was ministered to the people, and not
appropriated to the Priests, as may be seen in them: Among their Popes Leo the
first, Gelasius, Gregory the great, and Gregory the third, do all directly
conclude the same doctrine: yea the last of the four commands, that Leo

even Lepers, if they be Christians, which should not be admitted to our own
Tables, yet should not be barred from the participation of the body and blood
of Christ. For schoolmen, Durand, Biell, Caietane, do with one consent avouch,
that all without exception, were to drink of the cup; because God is no
respecter of persons, and that this custom of communicating with both kinds,
endured long in the Church. And whereas Thomas Aquinas says, that to avoid
irreuerence it is wisely observed in certain Churches, that the blood should
not be received of the people, but of the Priests only. It is to be marked,
first, that he says in certain Churches, by which he confesses, that it was
not universally received in his days: and secondly, that it is wisely
observed, by which he insinuates, that before time it was not observed, but
indiscreetly neglected.

50. Lastly, for the Fathers, it would be too tedious to recite all their
testimonies, only therefore I refer the Reader to the places quoted in the
margent; or if he desire to behold at one view all their opinions, to Plesseis
first book, and tenth Chapter of the Mass, where he shall find a whole
catalogue of them: I will content my self with one only saying of
Chrysostom, in his eighteenth Homily, upon the first to the Corinthians, he
thus writes: Sometime there is no difference Chrysostom. hom. 18 in 1. Cor.
betwixt the Priest and the people, as to wit, at the receiving of the sacred
mysteries; for all are admitted to them alike: for though in the old Testament
it was not lawful for the people to eat of the same things with the Priests:
yet the matter is otherwise now: for one body, and one cup is propounded unto
all. This doctrine therefore is an Innovation by the judgment of all these.

51. Transubstantiation comes in the next place, which 8.
though they labor tooth and nail to procue to be of great antiquity; yet we
have the testimony of Scotus, of Tonstall, Scot. Script. Oxen. 4. d. 10. 4.
and of Biell, who affirm that before the Council of Lateran, 1. Tonstal. de
verit. corp. and sang. page 46 Bi^l. Canon. lect. 41. Lumbard. l. 4. 9.
distinct. 2. a. Bell. de Euchar. l. 3. c. 23.
which was in the year 1215. Transubstantiation was no doctrine of faith, and
that it was free for all men, till that time to follow their own conjecture,
as concerning the manner of of the presence. Lumbard also says, that he is not
able to define what manner of conversion is in the Sacrament: and Bellarmine
himself confesses, that the name transubstantiation, was first found out, and
brought into the world by the Laterane Council: though he labor to prove
that the thing it self was believed long before. And thus howsoever this
bastard Babe was borne before, yet it is not denied but that it was then
Christened.

52. And how long before was it borne I pray you? Marry Bellarmine alleges
two Councils, both held at Rome; one under Nicholas the second: the other under
Gregory the seventh: in both which Berengarius was constrained to abjure his
heresy (as he calls it) and to subscribe to this article, that the bread and
wine after consecration, are changed into the very body and blood of Christ:
but concerning the Council, under Gregory the seventh, we have just causes to
doubt whether there were any such or no: first, because the acts of Surius.
tom. council. 3. Benno Card. in vita and gest. Hild^brandi. Bell. de Euchar. l.
2. c. 2.
it are no where to be sound; and secondly, because the same Pope Gregory is
reported by Cardinal Benno, to have doubted, whether the opinion of
Berengarius, or of the Church of Rome were more sound: And for the other
Council under Nicholas the second, Bellarmine himself confesses, that
Berengarius was constrained only to confess the real presence and not
transubstantiation, and so indeed in both of them, not the manner of the
presence, which is transubstantiation, but the realty thereof was in question:
But let it be granted that it was decreed in these two Councils, yet the
antiquity is not very great, for the eldest of them was but in the year, 1059.

53. As for the opinion of the Church, from the firstage of it, until these
times, though Bellarmine produces many testimonies See Doctor Morton
Protestant appeal, l. 2. c. 2. See Doctor white, page 347.
of the Fathers, yet either they are counterfeit, or little to the purpose, or
at least wise misapplied and understood: whereas the testimonies of the same
Fathers, and others produced by us against this doctrine, are so plain, direct
and peremptory, that by no sound reason they can be avoided. I may not
ouerburden the Reader with a repetition of them, they may find the^ els-where
at large discoursed: so that though the just time cannot be assigned when this
error sprung in the Church: yet it is a novel doctrine, borne since the purer
times of the Gospel, and growing in stature and strength till the Laterane
Council, and then taking it name and full perfection.

54. Their private Masses may be ranked in the next place, 9.
I mean such private Masses, wherein the Priest alone does participate the
Sacrament without the people. This is a doctrine and practice in the Church of
Rome, as may appear Council Trid. sess. 6. c. 6. can. 8. Bell. de inissa. l. 2.
c. 9.
both in the Council of Trent, where it is approved for Catholic and
lawful: and in Bellarmine, and others, which have their mouths full of
arguments to defend the same: but I will not meddle with their arguments, only
my task is to prove it to be a nouelty; which I may well do by these three
reasons: First, because it is contrary to our Saviors first institution:
Secondly, to the writing and practicing of the Apostles: and thirdly, to the
example of the Primitive Church. That it is contrary to Christ's first
institution, it is evident, because Christ at his last Supper did not take the
bread and wine alone, his Apostles beholding, and looking on, and consecrate
them, and so eat and drink them himself, but gave both the Elements unto them
all, and bade them eat and drink them in remembrance of him: this was the
first institution of the Sacrament, which ought to be a pattern to the Church
of God for ever. But Bellarmine says, that it was but Bell. de missa. l. 2. c.
10.
an affirmative precept of our Savior, and therefore did bind no further then
the circumstance of time, place and person would permit; and that to
communicate in the Sacrament, was no essential part thereof; and therefore
might be omitted upon occasion. To which I answer, that though it be false
which he says, touching communicating in the Sacrament, that it is no
essential part thereof: for the contrary may be proved both by Scripture,
which calls the whole Sacrament a Communion, 1. Cor. 10. and by analogy of
the Passover in the Law, which was to be eaten of all: and by the confession
of their own learned Schooleman Gabriel Piel, who says, Gabriel Biel. in
Canon. lect. 26. tit. ^.
that the consecration in the Eucharist is ordained for the use, which is, the
eating of it, as unto the next end after a sort: yet it is sufficient for our
purpose, that he confesses that it is a variation from the first institution,
and therefore without question an Innovation.

55. Secondly, that it is contrary to the doctrine and practice of the
Apostles, appears by this, because the Apostle Saint Paul sometimes calls
the ministration of the Sacrament, a breaking of bread, and that through
households. By which Acts 2. 46.
is necessarily insinuated a distribution and dispensation of it 1. Cor. 10. 16.
to others, besides the Priest: Sometimes the communion or communication of the
body and blood of Christ. Yea the Apostle says plainly, that we that are
many, are one bread, and one body; because we are partakers of one bread; but
if it be private, then there is no communion, neither are there many, and
neither is the bread which is made of many grains of corn, nor the wine
crushed out of many grapes, a representation of the mystical body of Christ,
(as all divines confess) as well as of the natural: if there be no mystical
body, that is, no Congregation to participate. Lastly, Chrysostom writing
Biel. ibidem.
upon 1. Cor. 11. says, that this was the fault which the Apostle blames in
the Corinthians, because they made that private which was the Lords: for the
Supper of the Lord (says he) ought to be common.

56. Thirdly, what the example of the Primitive Church was after the Apostles,
the ancient Lyturgies then in use do declare: in none of which can we find
any color for this practice: which evidence caused judicious Cassander to
confess Cassand. consult. art. 24.
that solitary Masses are most manifestly confuted by the ancient Greek
Lyturgies: and that which he says of the Greek, may be justly auerred of
all the other ancient missals, that were in use of the Church, and are extant
in the writings of the Fathers, as Chrysostomes, Ambroses, Gregory's, and such
like: yea the Canon of the Romish mass it self is against this error: for it
is said there: As many of us have been partakers: and Bless O Lord these
Sacraments to us, which we have received. Now how can this be said without
mockage, when there is none present but the Priest.

57. But besides those Lyturgies, we have the plain testimonies of ancient
Fathers: one Chrysostom for breuities sake Chrysostom. hom. 3. in Ephesians. c. 1.
shall stand instead of all: he thus propounds the custom of the Church in
his time: The daily oblation (says he) is made in vain, when there is none to
participate: and again, Whosoever is not partaker of the mysteries, stand by as
a foolish and wicked man. This is flat contrary to the Romish practice, where
the Priest masseth alone, and the people kneel, by knocking, their breasts, and
lifting up their eyes to their breaden God: you see then there was no such
custom in Chrysostomes time: and this further may be confirmed by the tenth
Canon of those that are called Apostolical, which does forbid any to be
present, but such as do communicate; saying, that they are disturbers of the
order of the Church: the same Canon also is Bell. de miss. l. 2. c. 10.
Humbert. contra ^b^l. Nica^. Monachi. Erasm. de concerd. Eccles. Cassand.
consult. art. 24.
repeated and confirmed in the Council of Antioch, cap. 2. And in the Council
Nax^^tense, it is said, that it is a ridiculous thing to murmr to the walls,
that which should belong to the people. Bellarmine himself acknowledges, that
it is a more perfect and lawful Mass, where communicants are present, then
where they are absent: and so does Cardinal Humbertus and Walasred; all which
laid together caused Erasmus and Cassander in express words to affirm this
practice to be a nouelty, not instituted by Christ, nor used either in the
Apostles times, or in the Primitive Church.

58. The next point may be touching the sacrifice in the 10^
Mass, for they teach, that there is offered up by the Priest a true real
propitiatory sacrifice for the quick and the dead: this is the direct doctrine
of the Romish Church, canonized in the Council of Trent: which doctrine how
true it is, I will Council. Trid. sess. 6. can. 3^
not dispute, only I am to show how new it is, which may appear: first, in
that throughout all the new Testament, where there is any mention made of the
Lords supper, there is not one word spoken of a sacrifice: for neither does our
Savior himself say, that he offered a sacrifice, when he first instituted
it, neither does Saint Paul call it by that name, when he delivers the full
doctrine thereof to the Corinthians: neither does Saint Luke affirm, that the
Apostles offered a sacrifice, when they put it in practice; but only that they
broke bread from house to house: now if this had been so essential a part of
the Eucharist, as the Romanists make it, yea if it had been any part at all,
our Savior Christ and his Apostles, would never have concealed it from the
Church.

59. If they object, that though a sacrifice be not mentioned, yet it was
acted both because Melchizedek was a type of Christ, and he offered bread and
wine, and also because these words, Hoc facite, Do this: as much as
Sacrificate, sacrifice: I answer, that neither did Melchizedek offer bread and
wine; but brought it forth only to the refreshing of Abraham, and his
fellowers; as the Chaldy Paraphrase, the Greek interpretours. Josephus,
Cyprian, and Chrysostom do interpret the place; and the words themselves in
the original, do import: neither does the verb facere signify to sacrifice
in that place, seeing as every schoole-boy knows, then it should be
construed with an Ablative, and not with an Accusative case, as here it is:
and this they themselves do evidently prove, when they cannot agree among
themselves, in which action of the Sacrament consists the essence, and
perfection of this sacrifice: whether in the elevation, which Sotus thought to
belong unto it: or in the consecration, as Suares; or in the oblation, as
Ecchius; or in the intinction, as Canus; or in the dispensation and
distribution, as others; or in the consumption, as Bellarmine, and Ledesima:
and so they know not where to fix the center thereof, having indeed no footing
in the whole circle of our Saviors example.

60. And as for the word (...) used by Saint Luke, Acts 13. 2.
it signifies no more but Sacra administratio, the performance of holy duties,
or the serving of God in any sort of religious Occumen. ln loc. Chrysostom. ibid.
h^^. 37. S^^us ibid. Ly^an. ibid. Dionys. Carth^s. ibid. Ca^etan. ibid. Suidas
in Lexico
worship, as the Fathers do all interpret the place: and not to offer a
sacrifice, as Erasmus translates it; or to say Mass, as our Rhemists would
interpret it; for then the Angels should say Mass in Heaven, because they are
said (...) Heb. 1. which some of them are not ashamed to say they do: but I
believe it all alike, as I do that tale in their Legend of Bees, singing Mass
in their Hyue about the host, put in by 2 woman, to make her swarms to
thrive. Again, of the like nature is that fond conclusion of Genebrard, who
because by Genebrard. in Lyturg. Apostol. c. 7. Leuit. 23. 16.
the Leuitical Law God commanded Cakes of new corn to be offered upon the day
of Pentecost, which is there called, A new offering: therefore the Apostles
sung the first Mass upon that great day of Pentecost, Act. 2. and that James
being Bishop of Jerusalem, was the chief actour therein. This is so gross,
that it needs no refutation; and it shows plainly the point I aim at, that
there is no color for their Mass in the new Testament, seeing they are
constrained to fetch it out of the old, especially by so ridiculous and strange
a deduction.

61. Secondly, if we consult with the primitive and pure antiquity, we shall
never find any just testimony for the Romish propitiatory sacrifice, for the
expiating, and purging away of sins: for albeit the Fathers do often call
this Sacrament a sacrifice, yet their meaning is not that it is a true, proper,
and real sacrifice, but only either a commemoration, and representation of
the sacrifice of Christ, finished on the Cross, or an application, and
obsignation of the same to the faithful receivers: which to be their
intendment, may be gathered, first, from their own testimonies, which are so
clear and direct, that I shall not need, save to refer the Reader to the
places quoted in the margent. And secondly, by Chrysostom. hom 17 ad Heb^^^os.
Theophilact. in 10. ad Heb^^^os. Aug. in lib. sent. prosper. Idem de side ad
Petrum, c. 18. Idem de ciuit. l. 10. Lumbard. lib. 4. distinct. 12.
Lumbard their prime Schooleman, and professed Epitomizer of the Fathers,
especially of Saint Augustine, who says expressly, that that which is offered
and consecrated by the Priest, is called a sacrifice and oblation, because it
is a commemoration and representation of the true sacrifice, made upon the
altar of the Cross. And thirdly, by their constant ascription to the sole
sacrifice of Christ, the only power of propitiation and satisfaction for
sins: which if it be true, then when they call the Mass, A propitiatory
sacrifice, they must of necessity understand not a real sacrifice, but only a
representation, and application of that only true sacrifice on the Cross,
besides which there is no other external and corporal sacrifice in Lactant.
epitom. diumor. I^^^^t.
the new Testament: as Lactantius plainly witnesses, when he says, that
those things which are wrought by the fingers, or done without a man, are not
true sacrifices.

62. Lastly, if it be granted, that many of the ancients did speak of a
proper and true sacrifice, yet the theatricall pageant of the Romish Mass
cannot be understood by them, both because in the ancient description of the
rites and orders of the Church, found in Iustine Martyr, Dionysius,
Chrysostom, Durand. l. 4. c. 1. Walasred. de reb. eccles. c. 22. Platin. vita
Sixti. 1. Rupert. de divine. ^ssic. l. 2. c. 2.
Augustine, and others, no such histrionicall representation in ceremonies,
gestures, words, and acts is to be seen; and also because the Romish Doctors
themselves confess, that the rites and ceremonies therein used, were not in
the Apostles times, but crept in by little and little, and were patcht together
at diverse times, and by diverse persons, as their fancies led them: now the
sinews of the Mass consists in these; and therefore, these being confessed
novelties, how is it likely that the thing it self should be of a different
nature?

63. The fire of Romish Purgatory is a bird of the same 11.
feather, it was neither kindled in the Scriptures, neither is it found in
ancient Councils, or in the writers of the Primitive Church: nor yet in those
that next succeeded the age thereof. I understand here Romish Purgatory, to wit,
such as is taught and maintained in the Church of Rome at this day, as an
article Greg. Valent. lib. de Purgat. Bell. de Purgat. l. 1. c. 3. Council.
Trid. Sess. sub Pio 4.
of faith, and is thus described: A fire of hell adjoining to the place of the
damned, wherein the souls of the faithful departing in the guilt of venial
sins, or for the more full satisfaction of mortal sins already remitted,
are tormented: which is nothing differing from the punishment of the damned, in
respect of the extremity of the pain, but only in respect of continuance of
time: the confession of this Purgatory (says Bellarmine) is a part of the
Catholic faith, and it is decreed by the Council of Trent, to the same purpose.

64. Concerning this Purgatory, if we consult with the places of the
scripture, alleged by them for the maintenance thereof, we shall find them
either friuolously, or falsely produced: for either they are allegories, which
can afford no strong conclusion in reasoning: or they are utterly of another
sense, except they be wrung and stretched beyond their ^ether, which to be
true may appear; First, because none of them directly say, that there is a
Purgatory: secondly, the consequence extracted from the^, is of so ambiguous an
Interpretation, that if one interpreter conceive them that way, two are of a
contrary judgment: thirdly, because they cross one another Iansen. concord. in
locum. Suarez tom. 4. in Thom. disput. 45 Maldon. in loc. Perer. in Genesis 6. 13.
in the Interpretation of them, as for example, Bellarmine objects, Mat. 5. 25.
which Iansenius interprets clean in another sense, so Mat. 5. 22. produced by
Bellarmine, is confuted by Suarez, and Maldonate, so 1. Cor. 3. 2. is not
understood of Purgatory, by Pererius, and so of all the rest: now how can an
article of faith be built out of these texts, when neither the words
themselves do plainly affirm it, nor by necessary consequence either in the
opinion of Fathers, or joint judgment of their own Doctors, it can be
deduced from them: and thus there is no fuel for this fire to be found in
Scripture divine. Nazian. in laud. Caesar. Ambros. de obitu Theodo^. and
Valentinii. Aug. confess. l. 9. c. 13.


65. Touching Councils it is to be noted, first, that the ancientest Council,
which is alleged for the proof hereof, is the third Council of Carthage,
which was about the year, 398. Secondly, the most of them speak not of
Purgatory, but of prayer for the dead, which might be done, and was done,
without any conceit of Purgatory: for they prayed for them of whose present
possession of Heaven, they doubted not, as has been showed before. Thirdly,
that the first Councils alleged to mention Purgatory, and decree it for a
doctrine Bell. de Purgat. l. 1. c. 5.
of faith; were the Laterane under Innocent the third, the Flore^tine under
Eugenius the fourth, and the Tridentine under Pius the fourth, in the year
1563. and this shows directly, and from their own confession, that it is an
article of no great antiquity.

66. Lastly, concerning the Fathers it cannot be denied, but that many of them
speak of a purging fire: but it is to be observed in them, that they most of
them, intended not the Heb. cap. 6.
Romish Purgatory; but the fire of the day of Doom, as the testimonies of
Basil, Ambrose, Hilary, Origin, Lactantius, and Jerome, all alleged by
Bellarmine do euince, if we will either examine them, by the contexts of the
places themselves, or give credit to their own Doctors, so expounding them; or
Vide Doctor Morton Protestant appeal, l. 1. c. 2. page 17.
to Bellarmine himself, who in diverse places crosses himself, and yields
as much as we avouch: Besides it is to be observed, that many of the Fathers
supposed that the Saints departed, did neither receive reward nor punishment
till the last day, but were kept in certain hidden receptacles till that time:
and therefore they could not dream of Purgatory, which is an intermediall
punishment, ending at the day of judgment. Of this opinion were Irenaeus,
Iustine Martyr, Tertullian, Origin, Lactantius, Clements, and many others of
the greatest ancients. Again, it is to be observed, that Augustine, whom they
challenge for the greatest patron of this fire, yet defines nothing
determinately of it, but speaks doubtingly, and problematically; and if he
affirm it in some one place, he leaves it in suspense in others, and utterly
denies it in a third: as for example, in his Enchiriden he speaks 10. Aug.
Enchir. c. 69. Idem de verbis Apost. sermon. 18.
thus waueringly: Such a thing is not incredible to be after this life, but
whether it be or no, it may be doubted: and in a sermon he seems utterly to
deny it, when he says: There are two places, and there is not a third, we are
ignorant of a third, yea we find in the Scripture that there is none such.
Again, it is to be observed, that those Fathers which do patronize this
Purgatory, yet propound it not as an article of faith, but as a free opinion to
be received or contradicted, as men thought good, or saw reason; and these
also were none of the most ancient: For Bellarmine climmeth no higher for it,
then to Athanasius Basil, and Gregory Nazianzene: for as for Dyonisius, all
knew him to be a counterfeit; but those lived after the age of the Primitive
Church: as for those Fathers which lived in those purer times, there is not a
syllable found in them for the defense thereof. Lastly, it is not to be
forgotten, that their own Roffensis does auerre, that whoseeuer ^ Rossens.
art. 18. contra Luther.
shall read the Greek Fathers, shall find none, or very rare mention of
Purgatory; and that all the Latin Fathers, did not at the first apprehend it:
and that it was not a long time universally believed in the Church, but came in
by little and little. These things laid together, do demonstratiuely show,
that Romish Purgatory, was not an article of faith in the Primitive Church, but
a late device, brought in by a vain fear, and false and lying apparitions,
and maintained ever after by the smell of gain and profit, which ^accreweth
thereby to the Popes purse, and for the maintenance of his pomp and pride,
which otherwise would soon fall to the ground.

67. Lastly, to tie up for breuities sake many points in one 12.
bundle, prayer for the dead, as it is used in the Church of Rome, has no
ground of antiquity: For though it cannot be denied, but that it has been an
ancient custom in the Church, and frequently used by the ancient Farthers, yet
their manner of praying was not of that nature, as it is now in the Romish
Synagogue: For first the Ancients prayed for those whom they were persuaded to
be already in bliss, as has been formerly declared: but the Romanists say,
that such Bell. de Purgat. l. 2. c. 18.
prayers are available only for souls tormented in the fire of Purgatory,
and that we may not pray either for the blessed, or the damned. Secondly, many
of the Ancients suppose that all souls were reserved in a certain secret
place, from the presence of God, which they called Abraham's bosom, Paradise,
the port of security, the outward court of Heaven, etc. And therefore could not
pray for their deliverance from Purgatory, as the Romanists do. Thirdly, when
the Ancients did pray for the Saints departed, they did it (as Bellarmine
Ibidem.
confesses) not in regard of any misery wherein their souls were, but for the
glorifying of their bodies in the day of the general resurrection: but the
Romish prayers are only for those that are in pains, that they might be
delivered. Lastly, the Ancients speak of the matter doubtfully; as Saint Aug.
de ciuitat. l. 21. c. 27.
Augustine, with a peradventure, and as of a laudable custom received in the
Church, but not as a doctrine of absolute necessity: but the Romanists obtrude
it as an article of faith, and call them Heretics that deny the same: and
therefore though in general, prayer for the dead be ancient, yet Romish
prayer is an Innovation declining from antiquity, both in the object and
subject, manner and end.

68. So auricular confession is of like nature with the former: 13.
For we confess that confession was ancient, but Auricular Romish confession
is but a late vpstart, both in respect of the absolute necessity of it, which
was brought in by Pope Innocent the third, being before accounted but only
profitable, and not necessary, as in the Council of Cabilon: secondly, Synod.
Cabilon. 2 c. 3^. Maldonat. Sum. q. 20. art. 1.
in respect of the priuatenesse; for Maldonate a Jesuit confesses, that for a
long time in the Primitine Church, there was none but public confession:
thirdly, in respect of the exact enumeration of all finnes, with the
circumstances, which implies an impossibility: for their own Rhenanus
confesses, that Rhenan. Argum. in Tertul. de p^nitent.
this is a deuterosis, or late invention of the Schoolmen: neither indeed can
a pattern be given of it in all antiquity: And lastly, in respect of the
merit, which by the Church of Rome, i^ ascribed to the very act done thereof,
of which there is not the least mention in any of the Ancients: In a word what
need we seek further, seeing we have the free confession of their Gloss
upon Gratian, who affirms, that this auriculaer confession is more truly
said to have been ordained by a tradition of the Church, then by any
authority, either of the old or new Testament.

69. So the exact number of seven Sacraments, which is an 14. Bulla p^i quart.

can. 1. Suarez Ies. tom: 3. disput. 12. sect. 1. Cassand. consult. art. 13.
article of the Trentish Creed, fortifyed with the greatest curse against all
that shall say, that there are either more or fewer, is indirectly confessed to
be a nouelty, by the Jesuit Suarez; for he says, that the Council of
Florence did but insinuate this truth, and the Council of Trent did expressly
define it, by which it is evident, that it was but an insinuation, in the
Council of Florence, and no article of faith, till the Council of Trent, and
therefore an Innovation: And directly by Cassander, who says, that until the
days of Peter Lumbard, we shall scarce find any author, who set down a
certain and definite number of Sacraments: and to put the matter out of doubt,
it is confessed that this truth, (as they call it) is not found in the
Scripture, but founded upon Ecclesiastical tradition: Suarez. quo supra. Bell.
l. 2. c. 24.
And although Bellarmine labors to prove out of Scripture, them seven, and
none else to be properly Sacraments, yet it is with as evil success, as
Tyrabosco the Patriarch of Venice, did extract the just number of seven, from
the miracle of five loaves, and two fishes: For first his own Pew-fellowes

Valent. de number sacram. ap. 3. Cassand. consult. art. 13.
disclaim, some one, some another of them; as Durand: does Matrimony to be
properly a Sacrament, because it has not the virtue of conferring grace: and
Bonauenture, extreme unction to be instituted by Christ: and Aleusis, and
Hol^ot, did the like, touching confirmation, and also because his proofs are
so frivolous oftentimes, that a recitation of them is a sufficient refutation:
as for example, to prove that there is a promise of saving grace, in the
conferring of orders, he alleges 1. Tim. 4. 14. and 2. Tim. 1. 6. where
Timothy is charged and admonished, not to neglect, but to stir up the grace
that was in him, which was given to him by prophecy, with the imposition of
hands of the Eldership. Here indeed is grace given to Timothy at his
ordination: but first, it could not be saving grace, because he was before
that converted, and believed, as it appears, Acts 16. but rather is to be
thought to be the extraordinary gift of the holy Ghost, as Saint Paul plainly
insinuates, 2. Tim. 1. And secondly, though it should be saving grace, yet it
is not promised to all others, though it were then given to Timotheus, neither
were all that received holy orders, partakers thereof: for then Nicholas the
Deacon should have been sanctified being an hypocrite. Who sees no^ then now
weakly he has proved this to be a Sacrament out of holy Scriptures; and
this may seem for a taste of the rest of his proofs, which are most of them
of the like nature.

70. Again, the doctrine of Indulgences, to wit, that the 15.
Pope has power out of the Churches treasury, to grant relaxation from
temporal punishment, either here, or in Purgatory, Antonin part. 1. Sum ^it.
10 c 3. Agrippa de vanuat c. 61. Roffens. in artic. 28. Luther. Caiet. tract.
de Indulg. c. 1. Alphons. haeres. verbo Indulg.
is so new an article, that diverse of their own Doctors, do confess, that
there is not any one testimony for proof thereof, either in Scriptures, or in
the writings of ancient Fathers, but that the first that put them in practice
in that manner, as they are now used, was Pope Boniface the eight, anno 1300.
neither could they be any older then Purgatory, being extracted from the
flames thereof: which has been already proved to be a mere novel
invention: so that the child cannot be old, when as the Father is not
gray headed; and that the matter may be without contradiction; read
Burchardus, who lived about the year of our Lord, 1020. And Gratian, and Peter
Lumbard that came after, who all speak of satisfaction and penance, and
commutation, and relaxation of penance, but yet have not a word of these Romish
Indulgences: whereas if they had been then extant, they would never have
passed them over in silence, especially in the discoursing upon these points,
whereupon they have their necessary dependence. 16. Viega de iustific. l. ^* c.

71. Last of all, their doctrine, touching merit of works, may be branded
with the same mark. For first, though the word merit be often used by the
Fathers, yet ordinarily it is not taken in that sense, which the Romanists use
it in, as witness both Bellarmine, and Viega, and Stapleton: and if they did
not, yet manifold examples out of their own writings, would prove to be true:
Secondly, the full stream of their doctrine does make against the proud
conceit of merit: for they ascribe all to Gods mercy, and Christ's merits,
esteeming their own best workings and sufferings, unworthy of the everlasting
Cyprian martyr. Hieronym. etesiph. Gregor. l 1. hom. 11. super Ezech. Bernard.
epist. 310.
and celestial reward: they never dreamt of that ambitious doctrine, taught in
the Church of Rome, that our good works are absolutely good, and truly, and
properly meritorious, and fully worthy of eternal life. Let their books be
viewed, and nothing can be more apparently clear then this is. Thirdly, the
terms of congruity, and condignity, were devised but of late days, by the
subtle Schoolmen, who notwithstanding could not agree among themselves,
touching the true definition and distinction of their own books, by which Viega
de meritis, q 7. page 816. Bell. de iustif. lib. 2. cap. 1. Waldensis
sacramental. tit. 1. c. 7
it appears, that it was not then any Catholic or universal truth. Lastly,
their own Doctors term the merit of congruity, a new invention, and that
other of condignity, no Catholic nor ancient doctrine, and the whole doctrine
of meriting, to have been first made an article of faith, by the Council of
Trent: all which laid together, prove it most clearly to be of no great
standing, nor they of any understanding that were the first forgers and
deuisers thereof.

72. Thus we have sixteen points, wherein the new Romish Conclusion.
Religion has degenerated from all pure antiquity, to which many more might
be added, but these are sufficient to euince our conclusion, which is this,
that seeing the Romish Church has neither in matter nor form, substance nor
accidents, any sure ground, either from Scripture, or the doctrine of the
Primitive Church; but is utterly unlike to it in many substantial respects;
therefore it cannot be the true Church of God, but an harlot in her stead: and
their Religion not of God, but of men; and consequently, that we in declining
from them, and conforming our selves, both in doctrine and manners, to the
Primitive pattern, are not fallen from the Church, but to the Church, and that
theirs is the new Religion, and not ours. And thus we see what all their
bragges and clamours, touching the antiquity of their Religion, and the nouelty
of ours come unto; seeing there is no one thing more pregnant, to prove the
falsehood of their Religion, and the Apostasy, and Antichristianity of their
Church, then this is. And to conclude, as we would think him not well in his
wits, that having been long sick, and after regained health, should say, that
sickness was more ancient then health, whereas he should rather say, that he
had recovered his old health, and that his new Inmate sickness was
dispossessed of his lodging, though it had kept it long; so in all reason it is
madness to think the reformation of the Church, and reducing of Christian
Religion to the ancient health to be more novel and new, then the horrible
sickness and apostasy, wherewith it was long, not only infected, but almost
ouer-whelmed. And this is just our case with the Church of Rome, but I leave
them to be healed by the heavenly Physician himself, Jesus Christ our
Savior, whose wholesome Physic must cure them, or nothing will.

MOTIVE XII. That Church which maintains it self, and the Religion professed
by it, and seeks to disadvantage the adversaries by unlawful unjust, and
ungodly means, cannot be the true Church of God, nor that Religion the truth
of God, by the grounds whereof they are warranted to act such deuilish
practices: but such is the practice of the Romist Church, and therefore neither
their Church, nor their Religion can be of God.
IT is a wonder to see what devises, sleights, impostures, and deuilish
practices the Romanists have, and now at this day do more then ever use, to
uphold their rotten Religion, and to ensnare men's minds with the forlorn
superstition, their kingdom being ready to fall, they care not with what props
they vnder-shore it, and the truth prevailing against them, they care not with
what engines, though fetched from hell it self, they undermine it, so that
they may any ways batter the walls, or shake the foundation thereof. My
purpose is in this Chapter to discover some of the Sathanicall practices of
these subtle Enginers, I mean, the Jesuits and Priests, and other rabble of
Romish proctors: It is not possible to reckon them up all, being so many and
various: such therefore (God willing) shall be here discovered, as are for
villainy most notorious, for impudency most shameless, and for certainty most
perspicuous; and by them let the Christian Reader that loves the truth, judge
of their Religion and Church, what it is.

2. The first proposition of this argument is grounded upon Mayor.
three principles* one of nature, another of reason, the third of Scripture:
nature teaches, that contraries are cured, that is, expelled by contraries, as
hot diseases by cold medicines, and cold by hot, light by darkness, and
darkness by light. Now truth and falsehood, good and evil, godliness, and
ungodliness, are thus contrary; and therefore naturally expelling each other,
they cannot be means of each others preservation: that cannot then be the
truth, which secketh to withold it self by falsehood, nor true Religion,
which is a doctrine according to godliness, which maintains it self by
unjust, ungodly and wicked practices: this is natures voice, to which reason
subscribeth, when it concludes, that it is not only improbable, but
impossible that Virtue should seek for Vices help, to fortify it self
withal; or truth for falsehood to maintain it: seeing the chief essence of
Virtue is to fly Vice, and of Truth, to be free from Falsehood. Plntarchs
Morals, Aristotle's Ethics, Tullies Offices, and all practi^ke of Philosophy
avouches this to be true: but if from nature and reason* the hand-maides, we
ascend to Religion the Mistress, we shall find in Scripture this undeniable
maxim* Romans 3. 8.
Evil is not to be done, that good may come of it: and therefore they which
shall do so, Saint Paul says, Their damnation is just: whence it follows,
that deuilish and mischievous practices, undertaken for defense of Religion,
and warranted by the grounds thereof, do both argue a rotten Religion; (for
like mother, like daughter, according to the Proverb:) and also prove the
professors and practicers thereof to be liable to the just damnation, alloted
by the Spirit of God to such wicked persons: there is no cuasion from this
conclusion, except they say that their practices are not evil; which whether
they be or no, the particulars of the second proposition, shall propound to
the judgment of him that will with an indifferent eye look unto them, and so
I leave this first proposition, fortified with three strong rampires of Nature,
Reason, and Religion; and come to the second, wherein the pith and marrow of
the argument consists.

3. That the Church of Rome is guilty of such ungodly Minor.
courses, for the maintenance of it self, and their Religion, though
miserable experience does sufficiently prove, yet because whilst things are
considered in gross, they hide much of their worth and weight; therefore it
shall not be a miss to display them in particular, and to offer them by
retaile to such as have a mind to apprehend the true value of their
counterfeit wares. In these six particulars therefore (to omit many other) I
arraigne them as guilty before God and men: first of horrible treason:
secondly, of cruel murder: thirdly, of damnable perjury: fourthly, of gross
lying: fifth, of impudent and malicious slaundering: and lastly, of apparent
forgery; and these be the propps and pillars of their Religion, by these they
labor to procure credit to themselves, and disgrace to us: and with these
weapons they fight against all that oppose themselves against their damned
opinions.

4. Touching their treasons, periuries, and cruelties, they are sufficiently
discovered in the first and second reasons before going, to which I refer the
Reader for his full satisfaction: only note, that as their practices have
been notorious in these kinds, so they are derived fundamentally from the
grounds of their Religion: notorious I say, for who has not heard of the soul
treacheries and conspiracies, practiced by Popes, and their Agents against
Kings, Emperors: some they have deposed, some prisoned, some murdered* some
expelled their kingdoms, some betrayed into the hands of their enemies, some
persecuted and undermined, and that by treacherous plots, and hellish devices;
to omit all others, and to confine my speech to our own Country: the
pretended Spanish invasion, in the year 1588, by that great Armado* compounded
of 138* great ships, addressed by the Popes instigation, who blessed and
Christened it with the name of an invincible Navy; and way made by the
Jesuits and Seminaries, who like Pioners and secret spies, indeauoured to
undermine the state, to spy out all conueniences for the enemies, and to
prepare men's hearts and hands to give assistance to them. The Irish rebellion
blown by the bellows of Rome, animated by Doctor Saunders, and other
Priests, sent to Coster. Apolog. part. 3. c. 9.
encourage the rebels against their lawful Prince: or as Coster the Jesuit
confesses, to be helpers to them in matters of conscience: and lastly, the
last horrible hellish, never sufficiently to be detested, Powder Treason,
(which if it had come to execution, as it was near to the point, would have
been enrolled for ever amongst the wonders of the world: and now the wonder is
that nature could afford such monsters, to devise such a villainy: or that any
should be so beso^ted* as to approve of that Religion, which was the mother
of such a monster. This I say, in which Romanists only were actours: Jesuits
Plotters, and the Pope the Ab^tter: (for Catesby, Percie, Rookwood, Winter,
Grant, and the rest, were rank recusants. Garnet, alias Walley, alias Roberts,
alias Darcie, alias Farma^, alias Philips: (was ever any honest, that had so
many names) Hall, alias Oldcorne: Tesmond, alias Greeneway, and others, were
professed Jesuits: and Baynham was sent to Rome, to give notice to the Pope of
this bloody practice, whereupon solemn prayers and supplications were made by
his direction* for the good success thereof. These I say, do witness
sufficiently, that treason is an ordinary practice amongst that generation, for
the maintenance of their Religion and pomp, and that they think it a lawful
and laudable act so to do, it being the common doctrine of the Jesuits and
Canonists, that if a King be excommunicate, either ipso facto, (as he is, if
he be an Heretic by their doctrine) or by denunciation from the Pope, then
his subjects are no further to obey him, but to rebel against him, yea depose
and kill him, if by any means they can: and though they dispense with their
allegiance, during the necessity of time, yet it is with this limitation,
quoad, until they be of sufficient power, and have fit opportunity to work
their purpose. This pernicious doctrine flowed from the mouths and pens of
Sunancha, Creswell, alias Philopater mariana Lupus, Tresham, Bellarmine,
Emanuell Sa; and almost all the rest of that treacherous generation.

5. Again, their periuries are also so notorious, that I need 2.
not to insist upon them: for who knows not that Canon of the Council of
Constance, which decrees, that faith is not to be held with Heretics: and
that sentence of a Pope reported by Guic^ardine, that the Church is not bound
with oaths: and that common doctrine of the Jesuits, that a subject is not
tied by his oath, to obey his King excommunicated: and who has not read of
Pope Eugenius, with his Legate Julian, animating the King of Hungary to break
his league with Amurath the Turk, and of Atto Archbishop of Mentz,
perfidiously against his oath, betraying Albert Count of Franconia, into the
Emperor Lodowick the fourths hands: and of Rodulph, Duke of Sueuia, instigated
by the Pope, to falsify his oath of allegiance, to Henry the Emperor, and of
Burghard, Archbishop of Magdeburge, released of his oath to his own citizens,
by Pope John the 23. And of Sigismund the Emperor, who was constrained by the
(...), to falsify his oath, given to John Husse, and Jerome of Prage, for
their safe conduct to the Council of Constance, and of Pope Zachary: Boniface
the sixth, and Benedict de la Lune, who unbound the French men from their oath
of obedience to their Kings* and of Gregory the seventh, with other succeeding
Popes, who did the like to the Germans, in respect of diverse Emperors* and
lastly of Pius Quintus, that excited the subjects of Queen Elizabeth, to the
breach of their faith, and open rebellion: all which does show, that they make
no conscience of perjury, so that they may maintain thereby their Hierarchy
and Religion, which to be so, this one testimony will sufficiently bear
witness out of the French Chronicles, when a league was made between Charles
the ninth, and the Prince of Condy: the Jesuits (says the author) cried out
daily in their sermons, that peace was not to be made with Heretics, and
being made, was not to be kept, that it was a godly thing to lay violent hands
on those vnpure persons, etc.

6. Lastly, their murdering cruelty, exercised against all 3.
that stand in their way, is so notorious, that I need not to Auent. lib. 5.
Abbas Vrsperg.
stand upon it: the examples of Henry the Emperor, marked out by Pope
Hildebrand, to be murdered by the tumbling down of a great stone upon his
head, in Saint Mary's Church, though with evil success; for the V^rlet
himself that was suborned to do this feat, tumbled down headlong together
with the stone, and so was crushed in pieces before the Emperor Math. Paris in
Henr. 3. Pet. de vincis l. 2. epist. 10. and 20. Cuspinian. vita Freder. 2.
came into the place. The poisoning of Frederick the second, by the secret
practice of Innocent the fourth, and of Conrade by the means of the same Pope:
and of Jews of Bauary, by the appointment of Clement the sixth, and of Henry of
Lucemburgh, by a Iacobine Friar of Saint Dominicks order; and that (O horrible
impiety) in the bread of the Sacrament, mixed with adamantine dust: and of John
of England, by a Monk of Swinestead Abbay: and of Henry the third of France,
stabbed by a Iacobine Friar: and of Henry the fourth, murdered by Rauillac,
that Devil in humane shape, who being Causabon epist. ad fronton. page 14.
demanded by the Judges, why he committed that horrible act, answered without
blushing* Because the King went about to aid the Protestant Princes of
Germany, contrary to the Popes mind, whom he did believe to be a God upon
earth: and of Parry, Lopez, Squire, with many other, which were suborned to
murder our late Queen: and of Faulx, that was prepared with a match kindled
at Rome, and a the euish Lantern to blow up the Parliament house. These
exanples I say, with many other, that might be produced, do evidently euince
them, to make no conscience of shedding blood, and murder, for the maintenance
and defense of their Religion.

7. Which that it may yet further appear to be true, consider the infinite
numbers of H^gonets, that is, Protestants, which have been slain in France
alone, for refusing the mark of the beast. In the Low Countries, 36000. at
least, are known to have been put to death by the Duke of Alba, for not
yielding in all things to the Romish Religion. The like persecution has been
in other Countries, and is still at this day, where their bloody inquisition
takes place, by the Vergerius. Bal^us de actis Pontif.
which in thirty years (as ir is recorded by Authors of sufficient credit) a
hundred and fifty thousand Christians were miserably murdered: and that which
is to be noted, it rages against none but Protestants, so that even in Rome, a
man may be either Jew. Turk, or Infidel, or what else, and be never
questioned: but a Protestant, he cannot be, but with danger of his life. What
should I speak of the multitude of poor innocents, that were in this land of
ours, adjudged to the stake, in the five years reign of Queen Mary.
Smithfield, Colchester, Couentrie and Norwich, and almost all the other great
towns, bear witness of this their cruelty, and the Innocent blood of these
poor souls, does still cry for vengeance against them.

8. And yet all this is nothing to those horrible and outrageous Massacres,
whereby whole multitudes have been but* hered like sheep in a slaughter
house, witness that miserable Hosiand. Cent. 13. l. 1. c. 4. Platina Innocent
3.
slaughter made of the Albigenses, by Friar Dominick and Simon Monfort, which
going astray from the truth, (if all be true which is written of them) these
butchers did not labor to reclaim by persuasions and gentle means, but
oppressed them by arms at the first, and so sent them packing to hell without
repentance: witness also that fearful Powder treason intended, not executed,
which if it had taken effect, such a massacre of men, and those of highest
place and worth, had been made as never yet the Sun saw the like. And
lastly, witness that dreadful massacre in France, under Charles the ninth,
when in one night were murdered at Paris many thousand Protestants, with the
illustrious Admiral of France; and at Lions, and other places, within one
month, as some say 40000. as others above 30000. The greatest and most grievous
perfecution in the Primitive Church, is not to be compared to this; for it is
recorded, that under Dioclesian, 17000. were martyred in one month; but behold
here the number doubled, that we might certainly know and believe that the
Pope is that true and great Antichrist, under whom, and by whose means the
greatest persecution that ever befell the Church of God should happen.

9. Neither is there doctrine any whit dissonant from their practice: for thus
Bellarmine delivers it in plain Bell. de Romans Pontif. l. 5. c. 6.
terms: as in a Christian, the Spirit is to rule, over the flesh, and to
chastise it, and keep it under, yea sometimes to undergo death it self, as
in the Martyrs: so the spiritual power residing in the Church (that is in the
Pope) is to bridle and restrain the temporal, by all means what soever, if
it rebel against it: yea the Cardinal Como, in his letters to Parry the
Traitor, animateth him to the murder of the good Queen, by his damned
position, that it is meritorious to kill a King excommunicate: and some of them
go yet deeper into hell, and entitle it an heroical act, that is, no ordinary
meritorious work; but such Iesuita Sicar.
an extraordinary exploit, as none but men of a more then humane Spirit can
perform; and for which an higher place in Heaven is reserved, then for common
merits. Can this Religion now be of God, that is thus maintained by treachery,
perjury and bloodshed? Is not this Church rather the purple colored harlot,
spoken of in the Revelation, embrued and dyed red with the blood of the Saints,
then the true Catholic Church of Christ? These things are so notorious, that I
need not further enlarge them.

10. Leaving therefore these, I come to the three last wicked 4.
means, whereby they maintain their Religion: upon which if I insist somewhat
longer, let the Reader bear with me, for so the nature and nouelty of the
matter requires. Their next practice then to defend their Church and Religion
is, by gross and palpable lying and falsehood; yea, so gross and palpable,
that any civil honest man would blush to be reputed the author of such fables,
which they obtrude upon silly people, as verities, necessary to be believed,
and which they like simple creatures give faith unto, as much as unto the
Gospel it self: and neither is the one or the other any marvel, seeing
Saint Paul prophesied long ago, that on the one 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9.
side Antichrist his coming should be according to the efficacy of Satan, in
all power, in lying signs and wonders: and on the other, that God would send
upon them that received not the love 2 Thessalonians. 2. 11.
of the truth, strong delusion, that they should believe lies: so that by this
prophecy, one of the chiefest props of Antichrists kingdom, must be lies: and
therefore the Church of Rome making no conscience thereof, shows it self to
be no better then the Synagogue of Antichrist: If they say that they do it to
a good end, namely, to maintain the truth: I answer with Job: Nunquid Deus
indiget mendacio vestro, vt pro illo loquamini dolos? Does GOD stand in need of
your lie, that you Job. 13. 9.
should speak deceitfully for his cause? no, he will surely reprove you for
it: and with Saint Augustine: Cum humilitatis Aug. de verbis Apos^ol.
causa mentiris, si non eras peccator, antequam mentireris, mentiendo
efficieris quod euitaras: that is, If thou tellest a lie for humility sake, (or
for the truths sake) if thou were not a sinner before, by lying thou art made
that which thou did avoid: what can be more pithily spoken for the reproof
of these men, who by falsehood, pretend to establish the truth, and by lying to
uphold their Religion: and if neither the Scripture, nor this holy Father, are
regarded by them; then let them hear the censure of the Heathen Cicero, who
Cic. Offic. 3.
concludes, that in virum bonum non cadit mentiri emolumenti sui causa: It
falls not to a good man to lie, no not Antonin. parta. c. 8. tit. 2. Salmer
in Romans 5. disp. 52. Espencer. com. in tim. Dig. 1. Canus loc. l. 1. c. 6.
for his own profit sake: what are they then in his account, who make a
common practice to lie for their advantage? But lest I should be thought to
accuse them falsely, and in reproouing their lying, to fall into the same vice
my self; let us take a short view of some of their notorious vnt^uths, which
are sparsed in their books. And here to omit their lying Revelations, lying
privileges, false Canons, forged donations, counterfeit de* lying
martyrologies, all which are stuffed with notorious falsities, and that by the
confession of their own Doctors: I will insist only upon their lying
miracles, wherein they vaunt themselves as a mark of their Church, and
wherewith they labor to uphold most of their erroneous opinions.

11. And first touching their miraculous transubstantiation, 1.
and adoration of the Sacrament: not finding in Scripture sufficient proof for
it: it is strange to see how many monstrous miracles they have devised for to
win credit thereunto. Bozius, Bozius de signis l. 14. c. 3.
a man of great fame amongst them, tells us these three tales: first, that
Anthony of Padua, caused his horse to kneel down and worship the holy host,
by which strange sight, a stout Heretic was converted to the true faith. And
secondly, Saint Francis had a Cade Lamb, which used to go to Mass, and would
duly kneel down at the elevation, and adore. And thirdly, that a certain
devout woman, to cure her Bees of the murren, and to make them fruitful, put a
consecrated host into the Hiue, which when after a time she took up, she
not only found a miraculous increase, but saw also a strange wonder, the Bees
had built a Chapel in the Hiue, with an Altar, and windows, and doors, and
a steeple with Bells, and had laid the host upon the Altar, and with a
heavenly noise flew about it, and sung at their Canonical hours, and kept
watch by night, as Monks use to do in their Cloisters. Who would not believe
now but that the host is to be adored, if he be not more senseless then a
horse, or a Be, or a Cade Lamb? But if this be true, why are Mice so
profane, that they dare rend it with their teeth? And why does not the Popes
Hackney kneel down, and do reverence unto it, when he carries it on his
back, accompanied with muletters, and horse-keepers, and Courtisans, and
Cooks, with sumpter-horses, and all the baggage of the Court, as often as his
Johan. Monluc. Mih. de Rel. ad Reg. Mat. Fulmen Bruturn. page 12. and 13.
Holiness is to travel abroad; when he himself follows, mounted upon a
goodly white palfrey, accompanied with Cardinals, Primates, Bishops, and
Potentats? Is more honor to be given to Christ's Vicar, then to Christ himself?
Or was Anthonies horse more religious then all the Popes horses? yea then the
Pope himself, and all his train? And if the host be so sovereign a
preservative for Bees, why do any good housewiues suffer their Bees to perish,
seeing they may have the host for God amercy, or at least wise for a very
small price? In the book of the conformities of Saint Francis, we find Lib.
conformit. Sancti Francis.
this miracle: On a time Friar Francis saying Mass, found a Spider in the
Chalice, which he would not for reverence to the Sacrament cast out, but
drunk it up with the blood: afterward rubbing his thigh, and scratching where
it itched, the Spider came whole out of his thigh, without any harm to either:
O strange miracle; and yet not so strange as this, that Christ's blood in the
Chalice, should poison Pope Victor; except Francis a Friar were more holy then
Victor a Pope: or the blood in one Chalice, were of greater force then in the
other: but peradventure the Priest in the one, had no intention to turn the
wine into blood, as the Priest in the other had: and then we know there can be
no conversion: but no marvel if this be true, seeing in the festiual of
Corpus Christi day, we read as great a wonder as this: to wit, of a Priest,
that having lost the host in a wood, as he came to housell a woman that was
sick, and having whipped himself for his negligence, went back to seek his
Lord God, and at last spying a pillar of fire, that reached from the earth to
heaven, ran thereunto, and found Gods body at the foot of that pillar, and all
the beasts of the forest about it, kneeling on their four knees, and adoring
it with great devotion, ex ept one black horse, which kneeled but on one knee,
and that black horse (says the story) was a fiend of hell, who had turned
himself into that shape, that men might steal him, and be hanged, as many
had been. This as it was reported to be done not far from Exbridge in
Deuon-shire: so it was as solemnly read in the Church, and as verily believed,
as any miracle that ever Christ wrought: who can doubt now, but that the bread
in the Sacrament, is really changed into the body of Christ, and the wine into
his blood, if this be true.

12. Again, to prove their doctrine of concomitance, that 2.
is, that whole Christ is under both forms of the Sacrament: Bell. de
Sacramento Euchar. l. 4. c. 14.
Bellarmine produces examples out of Surius: Vincentius, and Alexander
Aleusis, where miraculously out of the bread being broken, blood plentifully
flowed to the view of the beholders: which if they were true, as may very well
be doubted, yet euince not that doctrine: for those miracles might be wroght
rather for the co^uictio^ of profane and irreligious receivers, and
confirmation of Christian Religion, against all enemies thereof, whether
Infidels or Heretics, then for the proof of the real presence, or
co^comitance of both parts of the Sacrament, under one sign: but that they
were not true, we have just cause to suspect, seeing the eldest of those
miracles are little above a hundred year old, at what time true miracles were
utterly ceased in the Church, and falseones were foisted into their rooms, as
witnesses Lyranus, who says, that the people in his Lyran. in Dan. 14.
time were notably deceived by false miracles, forged by Priests, and their
accomplices for gain: and Canus, who affirms, that writers in his time forged
many things of purpose, and suggested Canus loc. l. 11. c. 6.
false miracles, to pamper the peoples humor, and to gain credit to Religion:
and in that respect taxes diverse grave authors, for their pronenesse in
satisfying the peoples appetite: and Agrippa, who says, that the writers of
histories making godly lies, Agrip. de v. v^it. c. 97.
did counterfeit Relics, frame miracles, and devise terrible fables: let
these go then amongst the rest, for at least suspected, if not convinced
falsehoods.

13. Further for the proof of their Canonization, and invocation 3.
of Saints, it is a wonder to see how many wonders they have devised. For to
omit that which Cardinal Baronius Baron. anno 1028.
reports as a truth, out of Guillerinus, and Vincentius, touching Saint
Fulbert, that because he was a most devout worshipper of the Virgin Mary,
therefore she came unto him in his sickness, and gave him her breasts to
suck: as also how she came to Saint Bernard in his sickness, to visit him,
accompanied Vita Bernard. l. 1. c. 13.
with Saint Lawrence, and Saint Benedict: and to omit how Saint Dominick caused
the Devil to hold the Candle ^o him, till it burnt his fingers: which Canus
brandes with the Canus loc. l. 11. c. 6.
stamp of a ridiculous fable: and how Saint Dunstone pulled the Devil by the
nose, or by the lip (as some other say) with a pair of Pincers; which being
as ridiculous as the former, Delrio disqu. magic. tom. 2. l. 4. c. 1. Antonia.
3. part. tit. 24. c. 2. Boz. de signis l. 15. c. 3.
yet is allowed by the Jesuit Delrio for truth: to omit also how their Saint
Francis had the five wounds of Christ printed in his flesh by an Angel, with
the nails sticking therein, and continually bleeding till his dying day: that
he used to ride in the air, in a fiery chariot, talking with Christ, and
Mary, and John, and accompanied with innumerable Angels: and that the birds
would hear him preach, with great devotion: and a wolf was converted by him,
whom he called brother wolf, and led him about with him in his journey: as
Breuiar. Rom^ pii quimi.
also to omit how Saint Denis had his head stricken off, and after carried i^
two miles in his hands: the like to which is written of Justinian the Monk.
Saint Othisa, Saint Fulcian, English feast d^ Sancto ^^chol. Legend. Anglic.
fol. 261. Capgrau. leg. fol. 35.
and Saint Victorice: and how Saint Nicholas in his infancy, lying in his
cradle, of himself fai^ed Wednesdayes and Frydayes, and would not take suck:
and how Saint `Patrick caused a stolen sheep to bleat in the belly of him
that had eaten it: and how Saint Bede preached to the stones, and they answered
his prayer, and said, Amen, venerable Bede.

14. To omit I say all these and many more, as being ordinary and common tales
in every man's mouth: I will only commend unto the Readers admiration, some few
more rare, and yet no whit less strange: as for example, a Parrate being like
to be surprised by a hawk, flying over the shrine of Legend. Thom. of
Caunterb.
Saint Thomas of Canterbury, cried miraculously, Saint Thomas, help more: and
presently the hawke fell down dead, and the Parrat escaped: so the famous
Virgin of Lauretto, when as a certain man was on the ladder, ready to be
hanged, being accused falsely for purloyning his masters hawke, as soon Tursell
Jesuit. l. 4.
as he did but think of her in his heart, and desire her help, the hawke
came forth with i^ngling in the air, and houering over his head, and at last
light upon the gallows, and so Legend. Sancti. Christopher.
freed the poor man from the halter. Saint Christophers staff being pitched
into the ground, began presently to bear leaves, whereupon eight thousand men
were converted to the faith of Christ. A Nun called Beatrix, running away
with her Paramour, lived certain years in a public brothel-house; Caesarius
Hester, bach. l. 7. c. 35.
but because she was a devout worshipper of our Lady, our Lady her self
supplied her room in the Nunnerie, and was taken for Beatrix, all the time of
her absence. Legend. Lombard.
Saint Christines tongue was cut out of her head, and yet sh^e spoke
notwithstanding, and her breasts being cut, instead of blood, milk issued.
Saint Brice being accused to be the father of a base child, caused the said
child, being but thirty days old, to speak, and confess that Brice was not
his father: the same also is said to carry hot coals in his bosom, without
burning his flesh or clothes. Saint Aidus espying Capgraua.
eight wolves that were sore hungry, gave them eight lambs of mere
compassion, which afterward by prayer be obtained lafe and found out of the
wolves bellies. Saint Adrian being called upon by a boy that was beaten, the
Masters hand was stayed in the air, so that he could no more touch him.

15. What should I tell you of, Saint Patrick* that drove Legend* Jacob. de
vorag.
with his staff, all the venomous beasts out of Ireland: or of Saint Roch, who
being sick of the pestilence in a wood, was fed by a hound, that brought him
every day bread from his masters table: or of Saint Lupe, or Low, who shut up
the Devil in a tankard all night, that came to tempt him, so that he howled and
brayed most hideously, and in the morning the holy man let him out: or of Saint
Dunston, whose Harp hanging on the wall, sounded melodiously, without
touching, this Antheme, Gaudent in coelis animae sanctorum: and of Saint
Martin, who being saying Mass, a tongue of fire came, and sat upon him, as
it did upon the Apostles: or of Saint German, who coming to the sepulcher of
one of his disciples, being a good while dead, asked him how he fared, and if
he would no longer go with him, to whom the other answered and said, that he
was well, and that all things were to him soft and sweet, and that he would no
more come hither: or of Saint Barbara, who turned the sheep of a certain
shepherd that bewraied her to her father that sought for her, into locusts?
But if you would have a lie with a latchet, look into the Legend, of the
Annunciation of our Lady, there you shall read of a certain Knight, who
betaking himself into an Abbey, was long learning the Aue Mary; and whereas
he^ could not get any further then the two first words of the Angelical
salutation, at last he dyed, and was buried, and upon his grave sprung up a
right fair flower deluce, in every leaf whereof, was written in letters of
gold, Aue Marie, and the root of this flower was found to issue out of the
mouth of the said Knight, because as he had those words always in his mouth,
while he was alive, so they grew out of his mouth being dead. Let all the Poets
match this fable if they can, and yet Ovid comes somewhat near it in his two
tales of Hiacynthus, and Aiaxboth, which were fabled to be turned into two
Ovid. Metamor. l^^. 10. and 13.
flowers, with the two first letters of their names imprinted in them, and thus
by strange and incredible fictions they maintain the superstitious invocation
of Saints, the ordinary conclusion almost of their legends being this; then let
us pray to this worthy Saint and glorious Martyr, that he will pray to God for
us, that by his merits we may have pardon and forgiveness of our sins.

16. Again, to persuade to the worshipping of relics, 4.
they tell us diverse such like tales: As that a young man falling off his horse
and breaking his neck, was brought to the grave of Saint Hyacinth the Polonian,
and presently revived. And a Maid, who had a young Heifer dead by some
misfortune, Scuerin. de vita* miracul. Sancti Hyacinth. lib. 1. ca. 19. and
lib. 2. ca. 7.
made supplication at the Tomb of this Saint, and when she returned home, a
Butcher being fleying the Heifer, it first began to stir the fleyed foot, and
then to lift up the head, and at last to rise up as sound as ever it was. We
read in the french Chronicles taken out of Turpin a Popish Wr^ter, that
Nichol. Gilles anno 645.
king Dag^bert robbed other Saints of their relics, to enrich the Temples of
Saint Denis, Saint Rustic, and Saint Eleutherie, whereupon it came to pass
that there arose great debate between the Saints, for those Saints which he
had spoiled, as Saint Hilary, Saint Fremin, and others, joined themselves with
the Devils, and craved aid of them to carry away the soul of the good king to
hell: but he called to his help the other Saints which he had enriched, who
resisted so valiantly the Devils and the Saints wronged, that they took away
from them his soul and carried it to Paradise. Who? which has any spark of
grace would not enrich the Temples, and relics of these three Saints, seeing
their power is so great to deliver a man from the Devil? But this next of
Saint Fremin is full as strange; for the golden Legend reports, that after
the Sun had miraculously sent his beams through a stone wall upon Saint
Fremins grave, and thereupon they had Legend. Invent. of the body of Saint
Fremin mortus.
dug to find out his body, there issued thence such a sweet smell, as they
weened they had been in a Paradise: which odor spread it self not only
through the city of Aniens where the body lay, but also unto diverse other
cities, the sweetness whereof as it moved much people to bring their oblations
to this glorious Saint, so it cured some a far off (as the Lord of Ba^gency)
from their diseases: but when this body was taken up and carried in the city of
Aniens, strange wonders were wrought: for then the Elements moved, (says the
story) the Snow that was at that time great on the earth was turned into powder
and dust: and the Ice that hung on the trees became flowers and leaves, and the
meadows became green: and the Sun which by his course should go low that
day, ascended as high as it uses to be on Saint John Baptists day in Summer:
and as men bare the body of this Saint, the trees inclined and worshipped it,
and all manner of sick persons what malady soever they had, received health,
at the Invention of the blessed body of Saint Fremin.

17. Another as strange a tale we have touching the relics Legend Sancti
Stephani.
of Saint Stephen, and Saint Lawrence: for when as one of them was buried at
Rome, the other at Constantinople (says the Legend) the Emperors daughter
which was possessed with an evil Spirit, was brought to touch the relics of
Saint Stephen, but the Devil within her cried, that he could not be
dispossessed, except the body of Saint Stephen was translated to Rome:
whereupon means was made that Saint Stephens body should be carried to Rome,
and in liew thereof, Saint Lawrence his body should be brought to
Constantinople. Now in the way as they were making this conueyance, the city of
Capua gat the right arm of Stephen, and builded their Metropolitan Church in
honor thereof: but when they were come to Rome, they would have borne the body
of Saint Stephen to the Church of Saint Peter ad Vincula, but they that bare it
were not able to go any further: and then the Devil in the maid cried out, Ye
travail for naught, for he shall not be here, but with Lawrence his brother,
therefore they bare the body thither, and then the maid touching the body was
presently made whole, and Saint Lawrence as rejoicing at the coming of his
brother, and smiling, turned himself into the other side of the Sepulcher, and
made room for him to lie in: and when the Greeks would have taken up the body
of Saint Lawrence to carry it to Constantinople, they were stricken dead, till
the Pope and his Clearks by their prayers revived them again: who would not
now worship the relics of Saints, if such great miracles be wrought by them.

18. But to conclude this point, and not to trouble the reader with too much of
this pedling stuff: thus they labor to gain worship to Images, honor to the
Cross, and Crucifix, and credit to Purgatory, and prayer for the dead, and
countenance to popish single life, as of many hundred examples which might be
produced, let these few suffice. Saint George being put into a frying pan full
of boiling lead, made but the sign of the cross, and he was therein refreshed
as if he had bin in a bath. Saint Margaret was swallowed up of the Devil in
the figure of a Dragon, but making the sign of the cross in the Dragons
belly, the Dragon burst, and out came Saint Margaret safe and sound. It is said
also that she took the Devil by the hair of the head, and beat him about the
ears. Saint Goodreck with the sign of the cross tamed Wolves and Serpents in
such sort, that they lay with him by the fire side without offering any hurt.
Saint Christopher being a Giant of twelve cubits in height, determined with
himself to serve none but the greatest King in the world: and therefore being
in service to a great King, he spied him crossing himself against the Devil:
wherefore perceiving that he was afraid of the Devil, he went to serve him as
one greater then the former, and perceiving that the Devil avoided the sight
of a cross, he asked him, why he did so? to whom the Devil answered, that
there was a man called Christ which was hanged on the Cross, in fear of whom,
as often as he saw the sign of the Cross he fled from it, for which cause Saint
Christopher perceiving that Christ was a greater King, renounced the Devil,
and betook himself to the service of Christ, and was called Christopher,
whereas before his name was Reprobus. He that would read a merry tale indeed,
let him read the Legend of Saint Christopher: As for a fearful tale, let him
go to Saint Brandons Legend: all the old wives tales that ever were told in a
chimney corner, are not to be compared to these two.

19. It is no news amongst them for Images to speak, nod the head, shake the
hand, sweat, and such like: or at least for some crafty Priest to work these
feats, to delude the people. The Image of the blessed Virgin Mary is said to
have spoken diverse times, to Saint Bernard, when she bad him good morrow,
whereupon the good man should answer, that she broke the Canons of the Church,
because it was forbidden that a woman should speak in the Church. To Saint
Hyacinth, Scuerin. de vita and mirac. Sancti Hyacinth. lib. 1. cap. 13.
who flying from the Tartarians, the Image thus cried upon him with a loud
voice, O my son Hiacinthus do thou escape the hands of the Tartarians, and
leauest me and my son to be cut in pieces, and trampled under feet: To whom
Hiacinthus answering, O glorious Virgin, this thy Image is too heavy, how shall
I he able to carry it? The Virgin replied, Take it, for my son will lighten
the burden. And to Alexius, who staying Legen. Lombard.
long in the Church Porch, the Image of our Lady spoke and bade the Sexten let
him in. So the Crucifix is said to have spoken to Thomas Aquinas, when he was
praying before it in Breuior. Romans in fest. Sancti Thom. de Aquin. lect. 5.
etia vita eius.
great devotion, Thou have written well of me Thomas, what reward therefore
will thou have. And to the Council at Winchester gathered together about the
question o^ Priests marriages in these words, Take Dunstans ways unto you, for
they are the best. Polidore Virgill, otherwise a strong Papist, yet smel^
Polydor. Virgil. Histor.
out this to be Dunstanes legerdemayne, and so may any other that has not lost
his senting: and thus we have two talking Images, that the Heathen might not
go before them in this, Bell. de Sanct. beatit. lib. 2. cap. 13.
who by Bellarmines confession out of Valerius Maximus, had two also that
spoke, the one of Iuuo Moneta, at the taking of Veyes, which being asked in
jest by a Soldier, whither she would go to Rome, answered, that she would:
the other of Fortune, who uttered these words, Ye have rightly seen me O
nation, and rightly dedicated me.

20. But that Images used to beck, and move their heads, and stir their hands,
there are so many examples that it would be lost labor to stand upon them,
only the image of Saint This is known to be true by many of the inhabitants
yet living.
Nicholas at Westchester, may discover the trick of all the rest, for at the
burning of it in the Marketplace of the city, there was discovered this trick
of fast and loose, the Image was made with such a device, that if one standing
behind, did pull a certain string which was in the back part thereof, it
would move the hand, as if it blessed the people. The like may we think of
that Roode of Poyters, which when William Longshampe Houeden.
Bishop of Ely lay a dying, did piteously weep and lament, so that the tears
fell down from his eyes, as it had been a flood of water, but no marvel, for
as they say, it was the accustomed use of that Roode always to mourn when a
Bishop departed. A pretty story there is in one of the Legends of the Virgin
Mary, of a woman who prayed devoutly to that Image for the delivering of her
son out of prison, and when she saw that her prayers prevailed nothing, she
took away from the Virgin her son out of her arms, and carried it home,
whereupon our Lady presently went to the prison and delivered the woman's son
out of hold: then the woman (says the tale) brought back the Virgin Mary's
son, and gave it her again, saying, O blessed Virgin now thou have restored
my son unto me, behold again thy son unto thee, and so both parties were
well pleased.

21. For Purgatory, and prayer for the dead, there be infinite 5.
tales devised, of all which we may give the same censure Aug. de vnitat.
eccles. 16.
which Saint Augustine does of lying miracles, that they are vel figmenta
mendacium hominum vel portenta fallacium spirituum, either fictions of lying
men, or wonders of deceitful Job. Riuius de spect. and apparit. Andreas osci^d
in coniecturis. Erasm. in epist.
spirits, of the first kind was that reported by diverse authors of certain
Priests, that dwelling not far from the sea side, took a number of sea-crabs,
and tied unto each of them light, and so put them upon dead men's graves in the
Churchyards, to make the poor country people believe that Spirits did walk:
but in one place, the legerdemaine was deprehended, for the Carpenters and
Masons coming the next day after all Souls night to work, found among the
timber and broken bricks some of the Crabs, with their candles on their backs
extinguished, whereby the knavery of this miracle was discovered. Of the second
kind it may be was that recorded by Saint Gregory in his Dialogues, (if that
book be his as is justly doubted, for he tells there a tale of a Bear which
was commanded to keep the Hermit Florences sheep, a thing not sauouring of
Saint Gregory's spirit, or if it did, then it argues him to have been too
credulous of lying reports, (as he is Canus loc lib. 11. cap. 6.
taxed by their own Canus) of a soul appearing unto a Priest that bathed
himself often in a water, and officiously pulling off his shoes, with an
earnest desire to enjoy his prayers and oblations for his deliverance, which
being performed, when he returned to the bath and found the soul no more
there, he concluded, that his prayers had delivered him out of Purgatory.

22. In one of these two ranks are all the strange stories published by these
Dialogues, Beda, Brigitta, Dionisius, Carthusianus, touching walking ghosts,
for either they were iugling tricks of imposters to deceive the simple, or
deceits of devils to delude the learned: and this may in no point more plainly
be proved, then against Priests marriages, for the disgracing whereof, and
advancing single life above it, an Idol at Winchester must speak as before
has been showed. The Emperor Jews the second must be tormented in Purgatory,
Sigebert Vincent.
because he would not regard the admonitions of Gabriell the Archangell against
Priests marriages. Emma mother to Saint Edward King of this land, must go
barefoot upon nine burning plowshares of iron, to try her chastity, and

Marian. Geot. Capgraue.
to have committed fleshly villainy, but she was borne over them betwixt two
Bishops, so that she needed not to hurt her feet. A young Nun being got with
child by a young Monk, two Midwiues must come from heaven, being sent by Henry
Murdach, then lately Bishop of York, and discharge her of her child without
pain, and take it from her, so that it was never seen more; and very likely,
for a privy or a fishpond might meet with it by the way, as it had done a
number more in former and later times: A thousand such lies as these shall you
find in their Legends, and martyrologies, and other books: insomuch, that
Espensaens a learned Bishop of their own, does freely confess, that no stable
is so full of doung, as the Legends Espensaeus in 2. tim. 4.
are full of fables; yea that very fictions are contained in their portesses:
and Canus another learned writer, that the Pagan Histriographers Canus loc.
lib. 11 c. 6.
did more truly write the lives of Emperors, then the Christians did the
lives of Saints: and that in the golden Legend, there are monsters for
miracles, rather then true miracles: and that he which wrote this book, was a
man of a brazen face, and a leaden heart.

23. Thus it is evident by the confession of many learned of their own side,
that these be lying tales, coined as holy Piae frauds. Agrip. de vanit. c. 97.
deceits, as some of them term them, but more truly, as deuilish devices, not
to maintain the truth, but error: for how can that be the truth which
stands in need of lying to maintain it: Caietane a Cardinal, and a great
learned divine Caiet. opusc. de concept. Virg. c. 1. Antonin. part. 1. c. 8.
tit. 2.
says, that the credit of the Romish miracles depends upon the report of
men, who may deceive others, and be deceived themselves: and Antoninus the
Archbishop of Florence, calls the visions of Bernard and Briget, touching the
conception of the Virgin Mary, fantastic visions, and men's dreams: why should
we then believe them to be true, when as they themselves believe them not.

24. If they object and say, why may not these miracles be as true as those
which are reported by many of the ancient Fathers: and seeing famous miracles
have been in all ages of the Church, why should these last ages be suspected
for falsity, Bell. de notis eccles. lib. 4. c. 14.
more then the former? I answer first, that those Fathers themselves, which
were reporters of such miracles, yet did repose no such confidence in them, as
to build their faith upon them, as the Romanists do: for Saint Augustine
says, Quisquis adhuc, etc. Whosoever yet seeks aften wonders, that he may
believe, is himself a great wonder, who when the world believes, Aug. de
ciuit. lib. 22. c. 8. Idem tract. 13. in Johan.
does not believe: and in another place: Contra istos mirabilirios, etc.
Against these miracle-mongers, my God has made me wary, saying, there shall
arise in the last days false Prophets, working signs and wonders, that they
might lead into error, if it Chrysostom. bom. 29 in Math.
were possible the very Elect. And Chrysostom, or whosoever else was the author
of those learned homilies on Matthew, proves that the true Church of Christ
cannot be discerned or known by signs or other mean, but only by the
Scripture: and that the working of miracles is more found among false
Christians, Tertul. contra Marcum. lib. 3. c. 3. and depraescriptic. 44.
Maldon. in Mat. 7. 22.
then true: and Tertullian says plainly, that the Heretics did raise the
dead, cure maladies, and foretell things to come: the same is affirmed by
Chrysostom, Jerome, Euthe^ius and Theophilact; as witnesses Maldonate the
Jesuit: by which it appears, that the Fathers thought miracles were not to
be regarded, except they were wrought for the confirmation of the truth: and
that a miracle was to be examined by the doctrine, not the doctrine by a
miracle: and therefore, that they are not any proper and true marks of the
Church, as the Romanists make them: nay that they are rather marks of
Antichrist, and his Church, as both our Savior and Saint Paul plainly avouch;
Mat. 24. 24. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9. 10
so that by this their great brag of miracles, they give us this strong
advantage against them, that their Pope is Antichrist, and their Church
Antichristian, which otherwise we should want.

25. And secondly I answer, that they themselves reject diverse miracles of
the fathers, as fantastic visions, and men's Antonin. part. 1. tit. 8. c. 2.
dreams: so does Antoninus call the vision of Bernard and Briget, in the
question of the Virgin Mary's conception: and Canus taxes Gregory and Bid
with this: that they missed the Canus loc. lib. 11. c. 6. page 658. louan. 1569.
mark now and then, who wrote miracles, talked of and believed among the
vulgar: that is, which they received by hearesay, and not by any eyewitness,
or sound proof: now why should we be restrained from that liberty toward the
rest, which they take toward Gregory and Bid: especially seeing many of their
miracles are such, as no reasonable man would ever believe, and deserve rather
the spleen then the brain: as for example Saint Jerome reports this to be
one of Saint Anthonies miracles; how Anthony travailing in the wilderness,
Hierom. in vita Paul^*
to seek out Paul, the Hermit met with a Centaure, (half a man, and half a
horse) who spoke to him, and showed him the way; and by and by when the
Centaure was gone, meets him another Monster like a Satyr, with a hook nose,
and horns on his head, the lower part of his body like a goat, offering him a
branch of palm: whom Anthony asking who he was, he answered; I am a mort all
creature, an inhabitant of the wilderness, such an one as the Gentiles deluded
with error, called a Satyr; and I am come as an Ambassador from my flock, to
beseech yon to pray to God for us, whom we know to be come for the salvation
of the world, whose sound is gone through the earth: if this be true, that
there are such monsters; or if they be, that they believe in Christ, and so
may be saved: let us believe then all that ever the Poets have written of
Ixion, Polyphemus, Pan, Silenus, and other such like mo^sters: Gregory Nissen
Gregor. Nyssen. orat. de vita Thaumaturgi.
writes, touching Thammaturgus, that the Virgin Mary, and Saint John camedown
from heaven to him, and taught him his creed: which is as likely to be true,
as that which the Poets write of Apollo, that taght Aescul^pius the rules of
Physic: or the Rabbines of the Angel Sanbasser, that was Adams Schoolmaster.

26. Saint Bernard, in the life of Malachias (if at least that Bernard. de vita
Malachiae.
book be Saint Bernards) tells us of Malchus the teacher of Malachias, how
he restored hearing to one that was deaf, and how the patient confessed, that
when the holy man put his fingers into both his ears, he felt as it were two
pigges issuing out of them. Again he reports, that a certain Prior of the
Regular Friars, seeing Malachie the Bishop to have many servants, but few
horses, gave unto him the horse that he rode on which being a restie jade,
and setting hard, at the first the Bishop found him so, but ere he had ridden
far, by a wonderful change, he proved a very excellent and precious
palfrey, ambling most sweetly: the like tale we read in the Dialogues
ascribed to Gregory, of a horse, which a Nobleman lent to Pope John, which
Gregor. dialog. lib. 3. c. 2.
being a very gentle, sober nagge, when as afterward the noble man's wife
should be set upon him, he pust and pranced, and stamped most strongly,
disdaining that a woman should sit upon his back, which had carried the high
Priest of the world: much like to King Alexanders Bucephalus, which being bare,
would carry any groom quietly; but when his trappings and furniture was on,
then he would endure none but Alexander. The writer of the life of Saint
Bernard, relates a pretty wonder, done by that holy man at the dedication of a
Church, when as the place was so filled with multitude of flies, that the
people could not enter into it without great annoyance: Saint Bernard using no
other means to destroy them, said only, I excommunicate them; and presently
the next morning they were all found dead on the floor. Does this savor of
Saint Bernards holiness: or can any man be so mad as to think, that so
holy a man would denounce excommunication, ordained to separate from the
Congregation open and sinful men, against poor silly flies: sure he has no
more wit then a fly, that will believe this: so that notwithstanding the
ancient miracles recorded by the Fathers, yet the Legendary Romish miracles are
not freed from gross and notorious falsehood.

27. Another practice of theirs to win credit to their Religion, 5.
and disgrace to ours, is slaundering and calumniating both our Religion, and
the professors thereof: and that so grossly and falsely, that their own
consciences could not choose but say secretly unto their tongues, thou lie,
when they were writing them in their books: but they deal like thieves, who
to clear themselves from suspicion of robbery, raise up hue, and cry against
true men: or like harlots, that lay the imputation of dishonestie upon sober
matrones, to the end that they themselves might be thought chaste and honest:
so being full of sores and blemishes themselves, they seek to cover their
own shame, by discovering ours. Which if it were in truth, though their envy
was never the less, yet their sin was not so great: but being notorious and
outrageous lies, they plainly show that they care not what they belch forth,
so they stain us with the filth thereof: and that they have learned that
Ma^chauillian rule, audacter calumniari, to slander boldly; because though the
wound be healed, yet a scarre remains.

28. Their slanders are darted either against our persons, or I.
the government of our Church, or our doctrines: let us take a short view of
all these: and first for their personal slanders; they slander all of us in
general, with the ignominious titles of solifidians, nullifidians,
nudifidians, Infidels, worse then Turks, etc. yea and say that we have no
faith, no Religion, no Christ, no God; and what not that either malice can
devise, or envy and rage utter? These slanderous reproaches are Parsons 3.
convin. Kellison survey. l. 4. Wright. art. 2. l 3. Reynold. Calui noturcisme.
set abroach by railing Parsons in his book of the three conuersions, and
almost in all other of his discourses; and by Matthew Kellison, who was of a
sudden start up from spigget to the Pulpit, a buttery divine; and by Wright
another of the same stamp; and by Reynolds, and Bellarmine, and Beran, and
Coster, and all the brood of rank mouthed Jesuits: who as if they were all
bitten with one mad dog, rave alike against our Religion, and the professors
thereof: but God be praised, with evil success; for their calumnies are so
transparent, that he that does but meanly understand the grounds of our
Religion cannot but turn the lie upon their heads.

29. But let us hear their reasons why we are all Infidels: mary they propound
two principal ones, and those very strong, as they think: first they say that
all learned Protestants are Infidels, because they build their faith upon their
own private exposition of Scripture: and secondly, that ignorant Protestants
are Infidels, because they rely their faith upon their Ministers credit. To the
first, I answer two things, first, that we do not interpret the Scripture by
our own private judgments, but by the Scripture it self: for some places are
so plain, and those principally that contain the grounds of Religion, that
they need no exposition, as Saint Augustine Aug in Johan. tract. 50.
witnesses, saying that quaedam in Scripturis, etc. There be some things in
the Scripture so manifest, that they require rather a hearer then an expounder:
and what those things are, the same father declares in another place, where he
says, that in those things which are plainly set down in Scripture, are
found all Idem de doct. Christ. l. 2. c. 9.
those points which contain faith and manners: and those things which are
obscure and hard in Scripture, we do not expound by any foreign or private
interpretation, but by conferring them with other more plain and perspicuous
places: and so except they say that the Scripture it self is of a private
interpretation, they cannot condemn us of that crime. Now that this is the
best way of interpreting, let the same Augustine inform us, who says, That
there is nothing contained in hard Idem Ibid. l. 2. c. 6.
places of Scripture, which is not to be found most plainly uttered in others:
and Chrysostom, who affirms, that the Scripture Chrysostom. hom. 12 in Genesis
Basil. quaest. count. explic. q. 267. Hier. com. in Isay. c. 19.
expounds it self, and suffers not the Reader to err: and Basil, who
tells us, that those things which be doubtful, or seem to be covertly
spoken, in some places of holy Scripture, are expounded by other plain places.
Of the same mind are the rest of the Fathers: and so we expound the Scripture
no otherwise then all the ancient Fathers used to do, and then indeed it ought
to be.

30. I, but we follow not the judgment of the Church, (say they) which has
the only key of interpretation committed unto it: if they mean by the Church
the fathers, we may justify our selves by condemning them of the same fault:
they deal with them as the Jews dealt with their wives, if they please their
humors they hold unto them; but if they cross or thwart them, they sue out a
bill of divorce against them, and put them away: nothing is more common then
this in all their writings: and therefore it needs no instances to prove it:
if they mean the Councils; why, by their own teaching, no Council is of
sufficient authority, except it be confirmed by the Pope: nor any decree or
interpretation to be entertained without his approbation. Therefore they must
needs mean the Pope alone, and if they do so, then we confess that we have
just causes not to tie our faith to his girdle, nor our understanding to his
brain: seeing many of that rank have been open Heretics, some notorious
Atheists, all men and therefore subject to error: yea seeing the body of their
Church is an Apostate harlot, and the surmised head on earth, that man of
sin, the great Antichrist, spoken of in the Scriptures. If to vary from him
then, and his Babylon, in our exposition of Scripture, be private
interpretation, we confess our selves guilty, but in all other respects
clear and innocent.

31. Secondly, grant that we do in some points follow on our own private
exposition, yet we are not therefore Infidels: for then most of the Fathers
should be infidels as well as we: for there are few of them which have not
sometimes privately, vea and falsely expounded the Scriptures: as their own
Doctors confess. Canus saying that they spoke Canus loc. l. 7. c. 3. Posseu.
biblioth. select. l. 12. c. 23.
with a humane spirit, and erred sometimes in things which afterward have
appeared to appertain to the faith: and Posseuine, that there are some things
in the Fathers, wherein vnwitingly they dissented from the Church; either
therefore they must tax them with infidelity as well as us, or clear us as well
as them, if all the force of the argument hang upon this pin, that therefore we
are Infidels, because we privately expound the Scriptures.

32. To the second, viz. that all unlearned Protestants are Infidels, because
they rely their faith upon the credit of the translatours, I answer three
things; first, that they do not rely their faith upon the credit and fidelity
of any translatour, but partly upon the judgment and authority of the Church,
which receives such translations, and allows them, and is able to judge of
them: and partly and principally upon the word translated, which contains
such holy and heavenly doctrine, as none that reads, or hears it, can choose
but acknowledge the Majesty of Gods Spirit speaking in it.

33. Secondly, if our people are therefore Infidels, because they cannot
examine the translations by the Hebrew and Greek, and do therefore rely their
faith upon the translatours credit: then Augustine was an infidel, who knew
neither of these languages, but was as it is written of him, monoglossos: and
then many godly Doctors and Fathers of the Church were Infidels, who for the
most part were all ignorant of the Hebrew tongue, and some of them of the
Greek also: and lastly then all the godly Christians in the purer times
Theodor, de curation, Graecor. affection. lib. 5.
who both read and heard the Scriptures translated into their mother tongues
were infidels, for they all relied their faith upon the word translated, but
not for the translators sake, who might err in translating many places, but
for the sound, holy, and heavenly doctrine therein contained.

34. Thirdly, if this makes men infidels to rely their faith upon man; then
the ignorant Romanists must needs be all infidels, whose implicit, Colliarlike
faith is grounded only upon the Church: that is not only upon the Pope, who
is in power the whole Church, but also upon every ordinary Pastor, be he
Jesuit, or Priest, or Friar, or any other, whom they are (according to their
divinity) bound in conscience to believe whatsoever they teach, as has been
showed: now this is to rely their faith upon the fidelity and credit of man,
and therefore the blame of infidelity falls upon them more justly then upon
us: and thus this accusation of theirs, that we have no faith, no religion, no
God, no Christ, but are plain Infidels, is a most notorious and open slander.

35. Thus generally they slander our religion, and the professors 2.
thereof, but not content therewith, they set upon particular persons, and
those that are most eminent in our Church, either in authority of place, or
excellency of learning, that like Captains march in the head of the ranks. For
to omit their horrible raylings against Kings, Princes, Magistrates, Nobles,
and men of high place, that any ways opposed themselves to the Romish
Monarchy, whose glorious virtues were so resplendent, that the mist of their
slanders cannot darken the luster thereof: Lord how they rave and rage against
the ashes of Luther, Oecolampadius, Zwinglius, Calvin, Beza, and other worthy
champions of our Church. O^ Luther they write, that he was an Apostate Friar,
that through envy, pride, and ambition, fell from them, because the office of
publishing Indulgences, was taken from the Cochl^us in actis Lutheri.
Monks of his order, and translated unto the preaching Friars; and that he had
conference with the Devil about the private Bell de notis eccles. l. 4. c. 13.
Mass, and was taught by him that it was unlawful; and that in a disputation
at (...)psia he uttered these blasphemous speeches, This cause was neither
begun for God, nor shall be ended for God: and that his life was incestuous,
and he himself a Campian. Rat. 5
notable wine-bibber, and his death infamous and fearful, he going to bed
merry and drunk, and being found the next morning dead, his body being black,
and his tongue hanging forth as if he had been strangled; and that after his
death his body so stanke that they could not endure to carry it to his grave,
but threw it in a ditch: and that the Deulls departed from many that were
possessed, and came to his sunerall. Thyrraeus Ies. d Demon. part. 1 these. 99.
These and many other strange fictions they have set upon the stage, for the
disgracing of the life, death, and memory of that blessed instrument of God.

36. For Calvin, they report, that he was branded on the Reinold. Caluino
^urcis. l. 2. p. 259.
back by the Magistrate for his Sodomiticall and brutish lust; and that he dyed
in despair, calling upon the Devil, swearing, cursing, and blaspheming most
miserably, being possessed with the lousie disease, and worms so increasing in
an impostume, or most stinking vicer about his privy members, that none of the
standers by could any longer endure his stink. The like slander they lay upon
the life of Beza, who Idem Ibid.
they say in his youth was an effeminate, wanton, luxurious Poet, and deserved
as much shame for his filthy life as Calvin had done. Zwinglius was slain (say
they) by Gods just judgment in the war against the Catholics. Oecolampadius
dyed suddenly in the night: and Carolastadius was murdered by the Devil.

37. Further they tell how Luther went about in vain to Cocl^aeus in actis
Lutheri. Bell. de notis eccles. lib. 4. ca. 14.
restore to life one Mesenus that was drowned, by whispering and murmuring in
his ear; and how he would have cast out the Devil out of a certain maid, but
was in danger to be slain by him; and how Calvin compacted with one Bruleus
Stap^yl. in Absolu^. resp^^s.
to feign himself to be dead, that to show the lawfulness of his
extraordinary calling, he might miraculously raise him B^ls^e. vita Caluini.
cap. 13.
to life again, and that he proved dead indeed, and deceived his expectation,
and made him a known impostor. Thus they belch forth their venom against
these good men, that through their sides they might wound the Gospel and truth
which they professed, but with what likelihood of truth I pray you mark and
judge, and because matters of fact can be proved by no other evidence but by
witness, except God miraculously discover them to the world, and witnesses
also must be impartial and without exception, or else their testimony is of
no moment, let us therefore compare those that speak for them with these that
are against them, and try whether deserve most credit.

38. Sleidan writes of Luther, that his death was most Sleidan commen. lib 16.
Lonicer. theat. histor. page 244.
sweet and comfortable, full of heavenly prayers, and godly exhortations, at
which were present the Earl of Mansfield, and other Noblemen, Iustus Jonas the
Schoolemaister of his children, Michael Caeleus, Johannes Aurifaber, and many
more, who testified the same to be true: and Erasmus reports Eras. epist. li.
11. ep. 1. ad Card. Eborac.
of his life, that it was approved with great consent of all men, and that the
integrity of his manners was such, that his very enemies could find nothing
in him that they might calumniate: which to be true, may appear by this, that
Fisher the Bishop of Rochester his professed adversary writing against him, does
not in all his book once tax him of misdemeanour, or of any notorious crime,
which he would surely have done, if any either just cause, or light suspicion
had been ministered unto him.

39. Touching the life and death of Calvin, Beza who Reynold, Caluino turens.
l. 2. c. 11.
was his familiar friend, and daily associate, affirms, that the one was full
of holiness and good works, and void of scandal: and the other full of peace
to himself, and comfort to his friends and beholders. Nicholaus Gelasius
writes of Nichol. Gelas. in epist. praefix. com. Caluino in Esayam.
his death, that he was at that time so far from blaspheming and cursing,
that the day before his death he called all the Ministers of the city together,
and took his leave of them with most holy and loving speeches, and the next
day gave over his life, dormienti similior quam morienti, more like to one that
slept then that dyed.

40. Zwinglius was slain indeed in the war against Romanists, but that does
not prove either his life to have been vicious, or his doctrine erroneous, for
then good Josias should be condemned for an ungodly king, who was slain in
war 2. Chron. 35*
by the Egyptians: and they must needs bring their own Doctor Sanders into the
same imputation, and that by greater reason, who was slain in the Irish war,
not only against Protestants, but like a perfidious traitor against his own
country and Sovereign. Oecolampadius whom they accuse to have died suddenly
in the night, albeit that kind of death has and might befall Gods dear
children, as it did that good Emperor Theodosius, of whose salvation, Saint
Ambrose nevertheless makes no doubt: yet Simon Gryneus who was present at his
death, and Wolfangus Capito that lived at that time, report, that he lay sick
sixteen days, and before his death exhorted all that were present to prayer
and constancy, and after he had sung the fiftieth Psalm throughout, he gave
up the ghost, with much assurance of Gods favor. As for Carolostadius, though
we have no witnesses of his life and death extant in print (as far as I have
read) yet it is most likely that this report of his death comes out of the
same mint, seeing it issued out of the mouth of his sworn enemies, and those
that hated him. Beza himself confesses the errors of his youth, but they
were whilst he was a Romish affected and unconverted, and yet no such great
matters neither, as might utterly blemish his good name, for they were not
lascivious acts, but wanton poems, the froth of youth: but let them touch him
if they can after he became a Protestant, malice it self is not able to cast
any dirt of scandal upon him.

41. Now compare our witnesses with theirs, theirs were enemies, ours friends:
theirs led with malice, ours with love: theirs absent, ours present: theirs
report that which they had by hearesay (if they did not rather devise then
receive) ours tell nothing but that whereof they were eyewitnesses: now judge
whether malice be not more prone to slander, then friendship to flatter; and
whether an enemy is not ever more forward to defame, then a friend to maintain
credit; and whether is more likely to lie, a malicious foe in disgracing, or a
loving friend in commending: and lastly whether deserves better credit those
that are absent, and fetch their report from other men's mouths, or those that
are present, and speak upon their own knowledge, and beholding. Surely the
doubt may easily be resolved, if we consider either that Plautus.
which the Poet says, etc. One eye witness is more worth then ten ear
witnesses, or that which their own Bellarmine says, Bell. de notis e^cl. l. 4
c. 14.
Stultum est, etc. It is a foolish thing to believe those that are absent,
rather then those that were present: or that which reason it self, grounded
upon Religion, tells us, that malice is more prone to lie and discredit an
enemy, then love and friendship is to defend a friend, seeing an evil
affection in a wicked man is perfectly evil, but a good affection in any man
is imperfectly good. These testimonies being thus weighed in an even balance,
we have greater reason to believe Sleydan, Erasmus, Gelasius, Melanchton,
Capito, Gryneus: then Cochlaeus, Surius. Bolsecas, or Schusselburgus, though
not a Romanist, yet as great an enemy: or any of these railing Rabsakehs, who
cared not what they wroght against our persons, so that they might springle
disgrace upon our Religion thereby.

42. But we, if we would urge this argument against them, and indeed as often
as we do it, we produce not for witnesses their enemies, but their close
friends, and professed favorers of their Religion; as Polonus, Platina,
Onuphrius, Lui^pr^ndus, (...)uclerus, Sigonius, Baronius, etc. all which do
report of their own Popes, that many of them were such monsters of men, as the
Sun never saw greater: neither Sardanapalus, nor N^ro, nor Heliogabalus, nor
Scilla, nor Catiline, do go before many of them in cruelty, gluttony, luxury,
and all manner of vices, insomuch as it grew into a Proverb, that he which
would represent the most complete villain that could be imagined, his next way
were to make the picture of a Pope: now these are not our slanderings of them,
as theirs are o^ us: but the constant reports of those that were sworn
subjects to the Sea of Rome and therefore would have rather with Shem, cast
their cloakes upon the naked filthiness of their holy Fathers, then with Cham
laughed at the same, had it not been so notorious and famous, that it could
not be hidden.

43. To conclude, that not only by probable conjecture, but by evident proof
their slanders may appear: we have two notable arguments of the same; the
first is that strange tale spread abroad in Italy, touching Luthers death,
before he Lonicer. theat. histor. page 246.
was dead: how in his sickness he desired the body of our Lord to be
communicated unto him; and after when he saw his end approach, entreated that
his body might be laid on the Altar, and worshipped with divine honors: and
how at his burial Almighty God raised a great noise and tumult, and that the
holy host hung in the air, and in a thunder that his body was taken out of
his grave, and nothing left but a stink of brimstone, which had well nigh
stifled all the standers by. This tale was published before Luthers death, and
a copy thereof came into his own hands, which he read with a glad heart, and
detested the blasphemy therein contained. The like Beza epist. ante Annot. iu
nouum testam.
slander was raised up touching Beza his death, long before he dyed, and came
also into his hands, as may appear in his Epistle before his annotations upon
the new Testament; by which we may see what manner of reports they be, which
are devised by these Romanists against us; and ex vngue leonem, by this judge
of the rest. The second is the confession of that perfidious Apostate Bolsek,
who (as it is reported) in a public Synod with weeping eyes, acknowledged
with what unjust and slanderous reproaches he had laden Calvin, and that all
which he had written of him to his disgrace, was false and untrue: now what
Bolseck did against Calvin, we have just cause to think to hane been the
practice of the others, against the rest of the forenamed godly men, and all
other of our profession, knowing that old Proverb to be true, that though the
wound of a man's good name be healed, yet a scarre will ever remain. Let this
suffice, touching their personal slanders, though much more might be added:
for their malice in this kind, is of an vnlimitable extent.

44. Secondly, they calumniate our government, and that 3. Sander. lib, de
Schismat.
which two notable false accusations: first, of injustice, both in the
substance of the Laws, enacted against them, and secondly, of cruelty in the
execution of the same* Laws: but it is an easy matter to discover their
slanders, and to justify our state from both these imputations: for touching
our Laws; first of all they are of that nature, that except they will condemn
all the statute Laws that ever were made, either in this, or any other common
wealth, they cannot condemn them of injustice: they were not made in a corner,
or devised by the brain of any Licurgus, Solon, or Numa Pompilius, pretending
the conference and counsel of some divine power, to gain authority unto them;
but by the whole state of the kingdom assembled in Parliament, the Lords
spiritual and temporal, with the Commons, a select company, gathered out of
the wisest, sagest, and discretest persons of the whole land: and that which is
the happiness of this kingdom above others, not rashly or suddenly, but after
mature and grave deliberation: neither by the Prince alone, without his
subjects, nor the subjects alone, without their Prince, but by both consenting,
subscribing, ratifying, and approouing the same. Now do they imagine any man
to be so simple, as upon their bare word to condemn Laws, thus made as
unjust, and not rather to condemn them as unjust slanderers, and impudent
sycophants, that thus rage against a whole state, upon a private malicious
spirit? especially seeing no Law be it never so just, does please the humor
of malefactors, that would gladly live without Law, that their wickedness
might go unpunished: for the Law Iulia could not please adulterers, nor the
Law Cornelia murderers, nor the Law Reminia promooters: and yet these Laws
were never the worse for that such malefactors disliked them; but they rather
the more desperate, for accusing the Laws of injustice: as if a thief
condemned of a robbery, should cry out that the Law was unjust, by which he
was condemned: so these fellows being guilty of treason against the Prince and
state, have no ways to cloak themselves, but with this outcry, the Laws are
unjust; whereas they should rather keep themselves innocent, and then the
Laws would never take no hold of them.

45. Secondly, if it be true which Thomas Aquinas says, that then Laws are
said to be just; first, when they are made Aquin. 1. 2. q. 96 art. 24.
for the common good: secondly, when they exceed not his power that makes
them; and thirdly, when they have their due form, to wit, when the burdens
are imposed on the subject, with a certain equality of proportion in order to
the common good: then our Laws are just and good Laws; for they are made by
full authority in Parliament, they tend to the conservation of the Kings
Majesty, and whole Commonwealth in tranquillity and peace: and their penalties
are so proportioned, that by the gentle punishment of some few, the whole state
is preserved.

46. Thirdly, they themselves were occasioners at least, if not causers of
those Laws that were made against them: for the Bull of Pius Quintus, which
came roaring into this land, in the tenth year of Queen Elizabeth, whereby
the Queen was accursed, and deposed, and her subjects discharged of their
obedience and oath, was the root of all this mischief: for it caused the first
Lnw made, anno 13. Elizabeth, and not only gave occasion to it, but bred
recusancy in ordinary Romanists, which used to come to Church before time, and
sedition and rebellion in the Priests and Jesuits, and some eminent persons;
yea and manifold bloody practices, by treason against her Majesty's sacred
person, and the state. These perilous effects procured other Laws to be
devised, more severe and strict then the former, against recusants, seditions
books, Jesuits and Priests, that being borne Englishmen, should go beyond
sea, and take upon them the Romish Priesthood, and so return into these
dominions to infect her loyal subjects with the poison of their doctrine: and
what were the causes, I pray you, since his Majesty's coming to the Crown, of
the reviving those former statutes, and enlarging them in some points; and of
the new oath of Allegiance, which has stirred up so many pens to write both
for it, and against it? were not the treasonable practices of many Romish male
contented persons? sure it was high time to countermyne against them, by some
Christian politic Laws, when their malice was grown to that hight, that they
cared not what mischief they wrought, so that they might work their wills:
by all which it is evident, that they may thank themselves for those Laws,
and not our state, which were drawn unto the making thereof, with unwilling
minds, and more unwillingly to their execution. So that as according to the old
saying, Good Laws spring out of evil manners; so from the fountain of these
fearful treasons, horrible rebellions, and bloody practices, sprung all these
Laws which they so calumniate.

47. Fourthly, the Laws thus occasioned by their own villainy, do not run
upon them with violence, but they desperately run upon the point of the Laws:
for if they keep themselves at home in quiet, they might enjoy the liberty of
their Conscience, without any danger from the Laws, save only a gentle mulct
imposed upon them, for refusing to communicate with us in the service of our
Church: and if like fugitive children they should flee from their own natural
mother, unto a step-dame in foreign Countries, and there receive upon them
not only the Character of Romish Priesthood, but also into them the poison of
treason, they might stay there still, without any coaction from the Laws: for
they were directed only against such as being priested, returned into their
country to practice treason, and to withdraw the peoples hearts from their
obedience, and reconcile them to the Church of Rome. So that the Law is but
like a naked sword, held forth by the hand of the state for it own defense,
which these desperate Priests run voluntarily upon, and kill themselves: and
therefore they themselves are guilty of selfe-murder, and not the Law of
injustice.

48. Fifthly, and lastly, this matter may be yet more evident, all men know that
there was never any Law hitherto enacted in this kingdom, to put to death any
Romanist for his Religion; except he either passed over the Seas, and returned
back with the order of Priesthood, his heart being full of treason, and his
hands of violence, as was said before, or gave entertainment to such traitors
in his house a certain time, that lurked for an opportunity to do mischief,
or moved seditions or rebellion in the State, let them name but one in these
57. years of our late Queens and now Kings regiment, that has been punished
with death merely for his religion, and we will confess them not to be such
malicious slanderers, albeit in truth to punish Idolaters, and such as persuade
to an Apostasy from God, with death, is no unjust law, but even grounded upon
the law of God it self, Deuteronomy. 13. 5. 8, 9. our laws then are so far from
exceeding the bounds of justice, that they rather offend in coming too short
thereof, which indeed is the less offense of the two, because it approaches
nearer to the medium; and that our Law-giuers knew right well, which moved them
to be rather too remiss, then too extreme.

49. Add hereunto that all of them, both priests and people, that are absolute
Papists, must needs nourish secret treason in their hearts, whatsoever they
pretend in outward show, for every true Romanist is bound to obey the Jesuit
or Priest, informing him upon pain of damnation; and the Jesuit errant must
obey the President resident of his College, and be at his direction, and the
College Governor must obey his superior of the order, and he fetches his
influence from the Pope, so that if the Pope being the highest Sphere move in
a violent motion, and command to depose or kill the King, as Pius Quintus did
our late Queen, then all the inferior Spheres must be carried about with the
same kind of agitation, and if they make either a trembling or retrograde
motion, they are not fit Planets for the Romish Sphere, and thus in Queen
Elizabeth's time all the rabble of them, I mean both Priests and absolute lay
Papists were traitors either in heart, or act, because the first mouer by his
Bull moved that ways, and so if they are not at this day by refusing the oath
of allegiance, yet if the Pope should shoot out his thunderbolt, and actually
excommunicate and depose our King, they must needs either renounce their
allegiance, or their Romish faith, which binds them to this necessity; albeit
most of their own Doctors confess that the King is excommunicate Panormit.
capin homin. extra de iudicijs. Gregory de Valent. ^om. ^. in Thom. disp. 1. q.
12. Bunnes in 2. 2. q. 12.
ipso facto, and then they need not exspect any personal denunciation of the
sentence, but may and must if they see opportunity, without any further
direction, rise up in arms, and pull him out of his Throne, thus which way
soever a man look, he shall spy Treason in their religion, and justice in our
laws.

50. Touching cruelty in persecution of them (which is the second crime whereof
they accuse the government of our state) it is so shameless an accusation, and
so far from show of truth, that there is none that either dwell amongst us,
or that know the mild and gentle administration of this commonwealth, but will
with one voice and verdict condemn it for a notorious slander. But for further
direction of them in this point, and for stopping of the mouths of those
malicious persons, that out of the rancour of their hearts toward us have
uttered forth these untruths, let these few observations be remarked, first,
that never any of them has bin put to death in this kingdom, but by form of
justice and due proceeding according to the laws, whereas the Protestants have
bin slain by them partly by treason, and partly by massacres, and that in
great multitudes, as is before declared.

51. Secondly, that such as have thus by law been executed amongst us were so
handled, not for their religion, but either for treason or rebellion, or some
other notable crime, which to be true, this one reason does sufficiently
prove, because there was no law ever yet made in this land to punish Romish
recusants by death, if they kept themselves within the limits of their
religion, and did not fly either beyond sea, and there become Priests, or
remaining at home, entertain such persons into their houses, and mayntaine
them against the State: whereas they on the other side have committed to the
edge of the sword, and the fury of the fire infinite Protestants only for
their religion, without any other crime or cause laid to their charge, as the
six Articles in Henry the eights time, and the miserable burning of many poor
souls in Queen Mary's quinquenie, only for denying to subscribe to the
doctrine of Transubstantiation, does apparently euince.

53. Thirdly, that in all Queen Elizabeth's time by the space of 44. years and
upwards, there were executed in all not above 180. Priests, receivers and
harbourers of them: and since king James came to the Crown of the latter sort
not any, and of the former not much above a dozen, (I speak within compass)
except those Powder-villaines, who they themselves dare not for shame but
confess that they received a just reward for their demerits, whereas in Queen
Maryes five years reign, near upon three hundred persons were cruelly put to
death for religion, as the public acts and records of our Church do
testify. Fourthly, that all the punishment inflicted upon our recusants, if
they kept themselves peaceable and quiet from actual treason, and
entertainment of traitors, was, and is, but a pecuniary mu^ct, and that so
gentle, that there is sufficiently left unto them to mayntaine themselves and
their families in good estate, except either they seek to seduce others, or
refuse to abjure the land, being convicted and past hope of amendment, or deny
to Statut. Elizab. anno 21. and 35. and Jacob. 4.
take the oath of allegiance being offered unto them: their goods are not
confiscate, their bodies not imprisoned, their persons not banished, their
lives are not taken from them, only a certain portion of their lands and
goods is forfeited, and that redeem a number of them at a low and easy rate,
what punishment could be more remiss, whereas when the sword was in their
hands, as now under the bloody Inquisition; not a small mulct, but a
proscription; not goods, but lives; not restraint, and limitation, but
imprisonment, bonds, and utter ruin and destruction does serve their turn.

54. Fifthly, that many of their Bishops and Priests have not only been freed
from all severe punishment, but also entreated after a kind and favorable
manner: to begin with the late Queens reign, of fourteen Bishops that
withstood her Vide Episcop. Elien. K^spons. ad Matheum* Tortum page 146.
proceedings in matter of religion, and all of them refused to set the Crown
upon her head, except Oglethorp the Bishop of Carbeil, nine lived at their
liberty, without restraynt of their persons, unless they account this a
restraint, to be committed to the free custody of their friends, as some of
them were, and lived in great ease and abundance all their life, and dyed with
age or sickness, as nature required, and not by any extremity of justice
showed unto them. Three of their own accord forsook the kingdom, not being
enforced by any superior command: and two, to wit, Watson of Lincoln, and
Boner of London, were committed to prison, but so, that in their prisons they
wanted nothing that either might serve for necessity or pleasure, liberty only
excepted; then after about the middle of her reign, Heart and Bosgraue, and
Rishton, and Norton, four Jesuits, being in the hands of the State, and
deserving by the laws to be punished, yet by denying that one vnconcluded
article of the Popes omnipotent Supremacy in temporal matters, obtained of her
Majesty not only life and freedom from punishment, but liberty and free power
to dispose of themselves in any foreign country at their pleasures; and at
the latter end of her merciful reign, the Castles of Wishbish and Fremingham,
wherein diverse of their chiefest ringleaders were in custody, do bear
witness how mildely they were dealt withal, their life having been there more
easy and pleasant, and their maintenance more plentiful then most of the
Students and Ministers among us in their best prosperity.

55. Neither has our virtuous King since his rightful possessing of the
imperial crown of these united kingdoms, been any whit more sharp and
severe, but rather more gentle and remiss, until their hellish Powder Plot
wrung from him, and the State some small addition to these former laws, yet
far remote from all bloody or cruel purpose against them. For to omit his
Majesty's exceeding clemency extended to them all in the beginning of his
reign, pardoning some, advancing others to dignities and offices in the
commonwealth, releasing the fines and mulcts to all, and giving by his
Proclamation free liberty to all Jesuits and Seminary Priests, to be free from
the penalty of the Laws, so that they departed the kingdom within a certain
prescribed time; even at this day, and ever since his Majesty's royal
regiment, those Priests that have been apprehended and might justly be put to
death by tenor of the laws, yet have and might be pardoned, if they would but
renounce the Popes temporal soueraignetie, and receive the oath of
allegiance, as the example of Blackwell their Archpriest, and of diverse
besides does testify.

56. Thus gently are they handled with us, and yet they complain, whereas when
they were armed with authority, all the Bishops and Ministers that refused to
conform themselves to their religion, presently either were apprehended,
imprisoned, burned, and most cruelly and tyrannically used, or constrained to
forsake the kingdom, and seek relief and succor in foreign countries,
there was no remedy nor releasement but either deny their faith, or dye, choose
they which.

57. And for their dealing at this day, where the Inquisition prevails, is
any one suffered to live among them that is but once suspected to be of our
religion? is not every such a one either murdered in secret, or brought to the
stake in public? the miserable butchery that is made of poor Protestants by
these tigres, is lamentable to speak, and almost incredible to be believed,
and were it death only it might be accounted a favor, but to be stripped not
only of all a man's goods, but also of his apparel, and a poor Beadles
threed-bare gown to be put on his back, and to be relieved by alms, as famous
Cranmer the Archbishop of Canterbury was, to be almost starued with cold, and
eaten with lice, as devout Latimer was, to be kept in a close stinking filthy
prison, having for his bed a little pad of straw, with a rotten covering, as
worthy Hooper was, to be whipped, and scourged, and stockt, and pend up in
Little ease, as diverse were by bloody Bonner: these cruelties were more cruel
then death, and yet these were the mercies of those merciless tyrants; yea,
they not only raged against the living, but the dead also, for they caused the
bones of Bucer and Fagius to be raked out of their graves, and to be burned for
Heretics: a practice many times used by Popes, and Romish Prelates, which
notwithstanding the very Heathen abhorred: nay that which is both strange and
ridiculous: one James Treuisam a Protestant, dying in the Parish of Saint Anno
1555. Lu^^^ 3.
Margaret, in Lothbery, and being buried in Moore-field, the same night his
body was taken out of the grave, and his sheet taken from him, and left naked:
and being again buried, a fortnight after, the Summoner came to his grave,
and summoned him to appear at Paul's before his ordinary, to answer such
things as should be laid to his charge, here is malice mixed with folly and
cruelty in the highest strain.

58. Now if it be a kind of mercy to dispatch one quickly that must dye, what
mercy is this in these men, that inflict so many deaths upon poor Protestants,
even whilst they live? Plutarch.
and if as Plutarch says, Nemo nisi malus loculos mortuorum violabit; none but
he that is wicked will wrong the sepulchers of the dead: what wicked wretches
are these, and cruel beasts, that spare not the dead bones, not fear to offer
violence to our graves? and yet for all this they are not ashamed to accuse us
of persecuting them, and to call our handling of them, by the name of a most
cruel and terrible persecution: Breue Pauli Quinti. anno 1606. Eccle.
Anglican. ^rophaea impre. Romae, cum priuileg. Gregor. 13
as Paulus Quintus does in his first brief to his falsenamed Catholics, in
the year 1606. yea they have not blushed to write, and to publish in print,
and so set forth in Pictures, that many of them have been here in England,
wrapped in Bears skins, and baited with dogs, some tied to horse maungers,
and fed with hay, others to have their bowels gnawed out with dormice, included
in bosons, with a number of such like horrible and fearful kinds of torments,
which the Sun never yet beheld in this kingdom, nor ever shall behold, I
trust.

59. Now then out of all these observations, drawn from the Laws and Statutes
of this Realm, and from the comparing of their dealing toward us, with ours
toward them, this conclusion does necessarily arise, that theirs is the bloody
and persecuting malignant Church, and not ours* and that by their malicious
imputing to us that great crime, they prove themselves to be open and
notorious slanderers, and so to persecute us not only with the sword, but also
with their vemous tongues, which according to the Prophet David's speech are
sharper then razours, and more virulent then the the sting of the Aspe, or
poison of the Cocatrice; I pray God amend them, and lay not this sin to their
charge.

60. The third object of their slauudering tongues, is our 4.
Religion it self, with the doctrines therein contained, where their practice
is either to derive sophistical conclusions, from such points of doctrine,
which we indeed held: or to say to our charges such doctrines as we never
intended: and these false forged conclusions, they make show to extract out of
our own books: but it is either by mistaking the meaning of the Author, or by
wilful perverting his words and sense: or at least by culling some incoherent
sentences here and there, that see me to make for their purpose, contrary to
the whole scope and drift of the writer: or lastly, by blemishing our whole
Religion by some sinister or exorbitant opinion, maintained by some one or
other, unadvised fellow, though it be contrary to the whole current of all
other writers on our side: as if for one man's error we were all flat
Heretics; or because one soldier plays the dastard, therefore the whole
army were cowards. These be their tricks of Legerdemaine, by which they
endeavor to disgrace our Religion, and to countenance their own: but Veritas
magna est, and preualebit. I hope so to dispell and scatter these mists by the
light of truth, that they shall vanish like smoke, and the truth be more
resplendent, like the Sun coming out of a cloud.

61. To the purpose: first, they exclaim that our Religion 1. Council. Trid.
Bell. de Iustif. l. 4. c. 1. Kellison. survey.
is an enemy to good works, and that we esteem of them as not necessary to
salvation; which damnable error, some of them ascribe unto us, as our direct
doctrine, others as a consequence of our doctrine, and our secret meaning: but
that both are lying slanders, I appeal first to our doctrine it self, which is
so clear in this point, that no man can doubt thereof, but he that is musled
with malice: for this we hold, that though faith be alone in the work of
justification, Grauida bonorum operum.
yet that says ever works through love: and is great with good works, as a
woman with child, which it brings forth also when occasion serves: and that
if it be disioyned from good works, it is but a dead carkas of faith, yea the
faith of Melancthon. lib. de visit. Saxon. Chemnit. loc. cap. de oper. renat.
Calvin. Instit. l. 1 c. 16. Polan. these. de bonis operib. nu. 14. Luther. in
Genesis c. 12.
Devils and hypocrites, and not of the elect. And this as it is the constant
doctrine of all our divines: so is it principally of Luther, whom our
adversaries accuse as the chiefest enemy to good works: for thus he writes
in one place touching the efficacy of faith: Faith is a lively and powerful
thing, not an idle cogitation, swimming upon the top of the heart: as a foul
upon the water, but as water heated by fire, though it remain water still, yet
it is no more cold, but hot, and altogether changed: so faith does frame and
fashion in a man another mind, and other Idem Ibid. c. 22.
senses, and altogether makes him a new man. Again in another place he says,
that the virtue of faith is to kill death, to damn hell, to be sin to sin,
and a devil to the devil: that is, to be sins poison, and the Devils
confusion. Thus he speaks concerning the powerful efficacy of that true
justifying faith which we rely our salvation upon, and they condemn as a
nulli-fidian portion. And touching good works, their necessity and excellency,
hear how divinely he writes in one place: Out of the cause of justification,
no man can sufficiently commend good works: in another, One good work,
proceeding from faith, done by a Christian, is more precious then heaven or
earth, the whole Idem tom. 4. fol. 109.
world is not able to give a sufficient reward for one goodworke: and in
another place: It is as necessary, that godly teachers do as Idem page 167.
diligently urge the doctrine of good works, as the doctrine of faith, for the
Devil is an enemy to both: what can be spoken more effectually for the
extolling of the excellency of good w^rkes^: and yet these fellows make Luther
the greatest adversary to them.

62. Secondly, I appeal to themselves, many of the greatest Doctors, amongst
whom do clear us from that imputation: Maldonate. The Protestants do say,
that justifying Maldon. com in Ioh. 3. 15. Viega de Iustif. l. 15. c. 5. Stapl.
de Iustif. l. 9. c. 7.
faith cannot be without good works: Viega. The Protestants affirm, that
justification and sanctification are so joined together, that they cannot be
parted: Stapleton: All Protestants, none excepted, teach, that faith which
justifies, is lively working by charity, and other good works. Lastly
Bellarmine. The Protestants Bell. de Iustif. l 4. c. ^. etc. 15. and l. 3. c. 6.
say, that faith cannot stand with evil works; for he that has a purpose to
sin, can conceive no faith for the remission of his sin: and that faith alone
does justify: but yet is not alone: and that they exclude not the necessity,
but only the merit of good works, nor the presence, but the efficacy to
justify. Now then, with what face can they bolster out this slander against
our doctrine, and accuse us to be like the Simonian Heretic, who taught, that
a man need not regard good works: and Eunomians, who defended, that
perseverance in sin, did not hinder salvation, so that we believed. This is
the first blasphemy against our Religion, wherein they do not so much thwart
us, as cross themselves: and that one may see yet more clearly, this to be a
malicious slander: hearken what Bellarmine Bell. de Iustif. l. 4. c. 4.
says concerning Luthers opinion of Christian liberty: Luther seems (says
he) to teach, that Christian liberty consists in this, that a godly
conscience is free not from doing good works, but from being accused or
defended by them: and let Luther himself speak again: By faith (says he) we
are freed not from works, Luther. tom. ^. page 472.
but from opinion of works, that is, from a foolish presumption of
justification, to be obtained by works: by all which we may easily judge of
the meaning of those sentences objected: ( Faith alone does save: and
infidelity alone does condemn: and where faith is, no sin can hurt nor
condemn:) that they are to be understood, partly of sins before
justification, and partly of such sins after, as destroy not faith, nor
reign in the believer, nor are perseuered in, but repented of, and labored
against, and thus our Religion is justified by the very adversaries thereof,
from this great crime imputed unto it.

63. Again, they accuse us as maintainers of this doctrine, 2. Bell. de
Iustif. l. 4. c. 1. Luther. in assert. art. 31. 32. 36. Calum Instit l. 3 c.
12. and. l. 4. c. 9. Melanct. loc. de peccat.
that all the works of just men, are mortal sins, and of this they make,
Luther, Calume, and Melancthon to be Patrones: but with what shameless
impudency, let the world judge. To begin with Calvin, these be his words: Dum
sancti ductu Spiritus, etc. (i.) Whilst being holy* we walk in the ways of
the Lord, yet least being forgetful of our selves, we should wax proud,
there remain relics of imperfection, which may minister unto us, matter of
humiliation: again, the best work that can be wrought by just men, yet is
besprinkled and corrupted with the impurity of the flesh, and has as it were
some dregs mixed with it: let the holy servant of God choose out of his whole
life, that which he shall think to have been most excellent, let him well
consider every part thereof, he shall without doubt find in one place or
other, something which savors of the fleshes corruption, seeing our alacrity
in well doing is never such as it ought to be, but our weakness great in
hindering the course: although we see that the blots, where with the Saints
works are stained, are not obscure, yet grant that they are but very small
works, shall they not offend the eyes of God, before whom the stars
themselves are not pure? we have not one work proceeding from the Saints,
which if it be censured in it self, does not deserve a just reproof..

64. In the other place objected, he writes thus: Qui serio tanquam sub
conspectu Dei, etc. (i.) They which shall earnestly as in the sight of God,
seek the true rule of justice, shall find for certainty all the words of men,
if they be censured by their own dignity, to be nothing but pollution and
filthiness: and that which is commonly called righteousness, to be before God
mere iniquity: that which is counted integrity, to be impurity, and that which
is esteemed glory, to be ignominy. Let the Reader now judge what notorious
liars these be to fasten this opinion upon Calvin, whose words I have
sincerely and fully set down, that every one may see their false dealing: for
in what one place names he mortal sin? or what one word tends to that
end? The worse terms he^ gives to good works in the first place are these:
That they are sprinkled with imperfection, mixed with the dregs of the slesh,
stained with corruption: and in the second, that they are filthiness, iniquity,
pollution and ignominy: but how? first, if they be examined by the strict rule
of Gods justice: secondly, if they be compared to Gods righteousness: and
thirdly, if they be considered in their own merit and worth without the
merit of Christ, whereby both their stains and imperfections are covered, and
an excellent dignity given unto them.

65. And indeed what I pray you does Calvin say herein, but that which the
Fathers said before? I will propound two or three unto you in stead of all the
rest: Woe be to our righteousness (says Saint Augustine) if God removing his
mercy, should search into it: and again, All our righteousness stands rather
in the remission of our sins, then in any perfection of justice. Our best
righteousness (says Saint Bernard) if it be any, is right perhaps, but not
pure, unless happily we think our selves better then our Fathers, who no
less truly then humbly said, All our righteousness is as a defiled cloth. The
holy man Job (says Saint Gregory) because he saw all the merit of our virtue
to be in vice, if it be strictly judged by the eternal Judge, did rightly add
in; If I will contend with him, I shall not be able to answer him one of a
thousand. Lastly, all beauty (says Arnobius) in Gods presence is but
deformity, all righteousness is but unrighteousness, all strength but weakness,
all riches but beggary. These Fathers, with all the rest, say no less then
Calvin, nor Calvin no more then they; and therefore they must either be
condemned with him, or be justified with them. Now if any man should say, that
they affirmed, that our best works were deadly sins, all men would condemn
him for a liar: so may we justly say of our malicious adversaries, in imputing
that opinion to Calvin, which he never meant, nor yet the words will bear,
and also which in all his writings he directly crosses.

66. That which has been spoken concerning, Calvin, may be applied to the
justification of Luther and Melancthon: who are so far from esteeming good
works, to be mortal sins, that they extol them hyperbolically, as has
been already manifested. Luther indeed says thus: That a good work, done
after the best manner that can be, yet is a venial sin, according to the
mercy of God, and a mortal sin, according to the justice of God: but what of
this? does he therefore say, that it is a mortal sin, simply, as they would
have him? no, in no case: for first, he calls it a good work, which he
would never have done, if he had judged it no better then a sin: secondly,
he says, that it is mortal, according to the justice of God, and venial by
the mercy of God, which is the very same that all the Fathers affirmed before,
intending by mortal, not that which is a high degree of sin, but that which
in it own nature deserves death. Thirdly, Luther himself shows what his
intendment is in the article going before, where he says, that not the good
work it self, but the defect in the work is truly sin, because it is an
omission of that precept, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.
By all which it is clear, that Luther does not condemn a good work, but the
evil in the work, and that though God does in mercy pardon the evil for the
goods sake, being a fruit of faith, so he might justly condemn the good for
the evil sake that cleaves unto it, being a fruit of original sin: so that
Luther stands clear and innocent from this crime laid to his charge in all
true judgment, and they stand guilty of a most foul slander imputed unto him
by their malice.

67. Thirdly, they slander us, that we slander God, by making him the author
of sin. This accusation, Bellarmine, Campion, Stapleton, Vasques,
Feuardentius, and all the Jesuitical rabble lay to our charge. And they accuse
Calvin, Luther, Peter Martyr, and all other Protestant-writers as guilty
thereof, but upon what ground, and with what show of reason, let them declare
unto us, for it passes the reach of our capacities to find out any such
doctrine, either direct in plain words, or indirect by logical consequence in
any of them; direct doctrine I am sure Calvin thus writes: The cause of sin
is not to be sought out of man's will, out of which the root of evil arises,
and in the which sin resideth. And in his Comment upon the Epistle of Saint
James, more plainly he affirms, that God is not the author of sin, and
that evils do not proceed from any other root, but from the evil
concupiscence of every man's own heart. And this doctrine he iterateth again
and again many score of times in his books. Peter Martyr in like manner is
most direct against this blasphemous Pet. Mart* com. in 2. Sam. 16. 22.
doctrine, for thus he says, That opinion of the Libertines which makes God
the author of sin, is a most detestable opinion, then which, nothing can be
imagined more wicked, nor a more compendious way to hell; And in the same place
he concludes, that though nothing in the world, no, not sins themselves come
to pass besides Gods will and providence, yet he is not truly to be called the
cause of sin, but all that can be said, is that he is such a cause, which is
termed by the Logicians, the remoouing or hindering cause, that is, not
efficient, but deficient rather, which in truth is no cause at all. Luther is
as direct: for he avouches this proposition in many places, God is not the
author of sin. Luther in Genesis ^o. 32. 38. 109.
And this same is the constant affirmation of all our Divines. What a
shameless forehead then have our malicious adversaries, that dare lay unto our
charge this blasphemy which we all detest and abhor?

68. I but (say they) though in word you say so, yet by consequence from your
doctrine it may be necessarily gathered, that you hold the contrary: for you
all teach, that God concurreth with a sinner in the acting of his sin by his
powerful providence, and not only foreseeth, but decrees, disposes, and
determines in his wisdom all the sins of men according to his will; and by
his secret working blinds their minds, and hardneth their hearts, that they
cannot repent. This we confess is our doctrine, if it be rightly understood:
for we teach, that God does not barely permit sin to be done, but decrees
before to permit it, and in the act works by it, and orders and disposes
it to his own ends, yet so, that he neither approves of it, nor is in any
respect the cause of the malignity thereof; and herein we consent both with the
ancient Fathers, and with most of their own Doctors.

69. Touching the Fathers, Saint Augustine shall be the Aug. Enchi. id. ad
Laure^t. cap. 100 and 101.
mou^h of all the rest: thus writes he, Sin could not be done, if God does
not suffer it, and he does not suffer it against, but with his will, and being
good as he is, he would never suffer any thing to be ill done, but that being
also Almighty, he can do well of that which is evil. And in the next Chapter,
God does fulfill the good purposes of his own by the evil purposes of evil
men. Idem contra Julian. lib. 5. cap. 3.
And in another place* God does work in the hardening of the wicked, not only
by his permission and patience, but also by his power and action through his
mighty providence, but yet most wise and just. And in another place, Who may
not tremble at Idem de great. and lib. arbitr. ad Valent. cap. 20.
these judgments, where God does work in the hearts of wicked men whatsoever
he will, rendering to them notwithstanding according to their deserts? And
again in another place, As God is Idem de corrept. and great. cap. 14.
a most holy Creator of good natures, so he is a most righteous disposer of
evil wills, that whereas those evil wills do ill use good natures, he on the
other side may well use the evil wills themselves. Thus Augustine is our
Patron in this Doctrine: and if we be Heretics, he is one too.

70. But let us hear their own Doctors speak, When Hugo de Sancto victore,
de sacr. l. 1. c. 12. part. 4.
God does good, and permits evil (says Hugo) his will appears, seeing he
wills that which should be, both which he does, and which he permits, both
his operation and his permission are his will. God works many things (says
Pererius) within Perer. com. in. Genesis 18. disp. 8.
him that is hardened, by which he is made worse through his own fault: he
stirs up diverse motions either of hope, or fear, lust, or anger, and
sends in diverse doubtful and perplexed imaginations, by which he is pusht
forth unto evil. A sinner (says Medina) ^artol. Medin in 1. 2. q. 93. ar. 6
when he sins, does against the will and law of God in one case, and in
another not: he does indeed against his signified will, but against the will of
his good pleasure he does not, nor against his effectual ordination. No sin
falls out besides the will and intention of God (say Mayer, Durand, Aquinas,
and other.) God Mayer 2. did. 45. q. 1. Durand. 2. did. 37. q. 1. Aquin. in
To. 9. Canus loc. lib. 2. cap. 4. Vega lib. 2. c. 15. de expos. council.
Trident. Suarez de varijs opus. Theol. l. 4. disp. 1.. 2.
(says Canus) is the natural cause of all motions, yea even in evil men, but
not the moral cause, for he neither counsels nor commands evil. Lastly,
to conclude with two famous Jesuits, Vega, and Suarez: the first says, that
though God does not command, counsel, approve, or reward sin, yet he does
will and work it together with us: and the second, that God works the act of
sin, but not the malice thereof. This is the very doctrine of Calvin, and
Martyr, and all Protestants: so that if we be guilty of this blasphemous
consequence, to make God the author of sin, they also must needs be in the
same case: but Saint Augustines distinction will clear us both. When God
delivered his Son, and Judas his Master to be crucified, Aug Epist. 48. ad
Vincent.
why is God just, and man guilty ( says he) but because though the thing was
the same which they did, yet the cause was not the same, for which they did it:
or if this distinction will not suffice, their own Jesuits will help us out:
In sin there are two things to be considered (says Vasques) the act and
defect: Vasques in Thom. ^. 2. q. 79. art. 2. cap* 5.
the act is to be referred to God, but not the defect in any case, which
arises from the corrupt will of man: or the act and the malignity thereof, (as
says another Jesuit) or the material part of sin, which is called by the
Schoolmen, subiectum substratum, the vnder-laide subject: and the formal,
which is the prauity and anomy of the action; the one of these from God, the
other from man: or lastly, if none of these will serve the turn, yet our own
distinction will acquire us, to wit, that Almighty God does so will and decree
man's sin, not as it is sin, but as it is his own just judgment upon sinners,
for their punishment, and the demonstration of his justice. And thus our
doctrine is free from the conception of this vile Monster, and their
calumniation is as unrighteous against us, as the dealing of God about the sins
of men, is most righteous and just. And thus those some what too harsh sayings
(I contesse) of Luther, Swinglius and Melancthon are to be understood, and no
otherwise, that the treason of Judas came from God, as well as the conversion of
Paul: charity will construe the words according to the speakers intendement,
and not stretch their intendement to the strict tenter of every word and
syllable.

71. Fourthly, they accuse us of blasphemy against the 4.
Son of God, for denying (as they say) that he is Deus ex Deo, God of God:
against the doctrine of the Nicene Creed. and this they call the Atheism of
Calvin and Beza: a palpable Campian. Rat. ^. Rbem. annot. in Job. 1. Posseuin.
de notis verb. Dei, l. 3 c. 74. Bell. de Christ^ lib. c. 2. cap. ^.
slander: for neither Calvin nor Beza did ever imagine, much less utter the
same in that sense which they lay to their charges: for let Bellarmine their
sworn adversary speak for them: Calvin and Beza teach (says he) that the
Son is of himself in respect of his essence, but not in respect of his
person, and they seem to say, that the essence of the Deity in Christ, is not
begotten, but is of it self: which opinion (says he) I see not why it may not
be called Catholic. Here Bellarmine tells us truly, what their opinion
was, and does acknowledge it to be a true Catholic doctrine: and yet in the
same Chapter he contemns Calvin, for his manner of speaking of it, and of
intolerable sauciness, for finding fault with the harshnes of the phrase used
by the Nicene Council, God of God: Light of light. Mark (I pray you) his
absurdity, it is Catholic, and yet it may not be spoken: it is true, and yet
it is to be blamed. May not a Catholic doctrine be spoken then? or must the
truth be smothered? This is such an inconsequence, as neither reason nor
Religion can any ways bear withal: and for his saucy dealing with the Nicene
Council, all that ever he says is, that it is durum dictum, a hard phrase:
yet so, that he confesses it may receive a good and commodious
interpretation, if it be understood in the concrete, that Christ who is God, is
of the Father that is God: the word being taken personally, and not in the
abstract; as if the essence of the Deity of the Son should be from the
Father, which is entirely subsisting, in, of, and by it own eternal,
incomprehensible, and most glorious nature: and this without question was the
true intendement of the Council; for else it had not confuted, but favored the
blasphemous heresy of Arrius, against whom it was assembled, which Calvin and
Beza do not any ways cross, but only bring unto it a fit and favorable
exposition. Thus we have Bellarmine, Caluines and Bezaes patron in this
doctrine, though full ill against his will: Riber. com. in Heb. 1. Gregor. de
Valent. de trinit. l. 1. c. 22. and l. 2. c. 17.
and not only him, but Ribera, and Gregory de Valentia, two other no mean
Rabbis, both which do conclude, that the Son as he is a person, is of
another; but as he is a simple Ens, is not of another: and that the Essence
does not beget the Essence, but the Father the Son: so that either they are
slanderers of the truth; or their Catholic doctrines may be Atheism and
blasphemy.

72. Again, they accuse Calvin of another blasphemy against 5. Bell. in
praefat. controu. de Christ. Posseuin. de notis diuini verbi, l. 3. p. 78.
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to wit, that he should make him inferior to
his Father, in respect of his Deity. This is Arrlanisme indeed, as Bellarmine
calls it; or Atheism, as Posseuine, if it were to be found in Caluines
divinity, or any other: but it is as far from him thus to think, as it is
from their malice to speak the truth. This is all that Calvin affirms, that
the Father is God, per excellentiam, that is, after a more excellent manner.
And what error I pray you is in this? does he not speak of the personal
relation that is betwixt the Father and the Son, and not of the nature and
essence of the Godhead that is in both, of equal dignity and excellency? This
is clear both by the former article, wherein he sloutly avouches him to be
(...) God of himself, and not to receive the essence of his Deity from his
Father, and so not to be inferior to his Father in that respect: and also by
infinite places in his books, where he directly makes the Son Jehovah, equal
to the Father in dignity, excellency, eternity, and all other properties of the
Deity: therefore he speaks this in respect of the person of Christ, in which
consideration the Father that begets, respected with the Son that is
begotten, may truly be said to have a certain priority of order, a^nd to be
God after a more excellent manner. Here is now neither Arrianisme, nor
Atheism, nor indeed any error in Caluines doctrine; but malicious lying and
slaundering in in these Jesuits accusation.

73. Nay, that Calvin may be cleared from all suspicion of error, and those
fellows condemned as notorious slaunderers: Tollet. com. in Ioh. 14.
Tollet one of their own fraternity affirms, that Athanasius, Basil,
Nazianzene, Hilary and Origin, all strong maintainers of Christ's divinity, and
professed enemies to Arrius heresy, interpret that place, John 14. My Father is
greater then I: in Caluines sense. Maldonate another Jesuit, in his Maldonat.
com. in Ioh. 14.
commentary upon John, adds to these, Epiphanius, Cyrillus, Leontius,
Chrysostom, Theophilact, and Euthemius, as patrones of the same opinion: yea,
and this last Jesuit himself subscribeth to their exposition: for he says,
that the Father is greater then the Son, in that respect that he is the
Son: for the Name of the Father is more honorable then the Name of the Son:
and the Schoolmen say as much as Calvin, when they ascribe Erasm. in praefat.
ad libro^ Tertul.
to the Father authority, and to the Son subauthority. What is this but to
say, that the Father is God after a more excellent manner? Now then if this
were neither Atheism, nor Arrianisme, nor heresy in the Fathers, nor in their
own Doctors: why should it be branded with those infamous titles in Calvin?
I see no reason, but that malice is blind, and that the hatred they bare to
that good man, made them to say, and do they cared not what, so they might
wound his credit thereby.

74. Luther is likewise traduced by them, as a denyer of the blessed Trinity:
and that, because the word Trinity is said to dislike him, for which cause he
dispunged out of the Germane Lyturgies, this sorme of prayer: Sancta Trinitas,
vnus Deus, miserere nostri; a notorious calumniation: for Luther indeed
blotteth out of the Germane prayers, a certain form like unto that objected,
but not so as he sets it down: for the word used in the Germane tongue,
signifies rather a triplicity, then a Trinity; which moved Luther in a desire
to maintain the pure doctrine of the Trinity (as Iunius observes) to blot out
that word, thinking it a dangerous matter, to use such a word in so holy and
high a mystery. By which practice he is so far from impugning or denying that
blessed principle, that he shows himself rather a zealous defender and
maintainer thereof, and in a word, to discover their falsity and his innocence.
List how divinely, and soundly, and orthodoxally he writes elsewhere of that
mystery: Vnitas Trinitatis Luther. tom. 1. page 572.
est magis vna, etc. The unity of the Trinity is more one, then the unity of
any creature, even mathematically, nevertheless this unity is a Trinity, or the
divinity of three distinct persons: that every person is the whole divinity, as
if there were no other; and yet it is true that no person is the fool divinity*
as if there were Idem com. 4. page 370.
no other. Again, upon the transfiguration of Christ, Mat. 17. he thus
commenteth: Here the whole Trinity does appear to the confirmation of all the
faithful: Christ the Son in a glorious form, God the Father by his voice,
declaring his Son to be God, and the holy Ghost in the bright cloud
ouer-shadowing them. Again, we believe (says he) that there is one God, the
Father Idem tom. 1. in Genesis c. 1^. page 165.
begetting, the Son begotten, and the holy Ghost proceeding from the Father
and Son: we determine such a plurality in God, which is of an undivided
substance, and an indivisible unity: again, the mystery Ibid. in cap. 3. page 65.
of the Trinity was discovered in the beginning of the world, after, understood
by the Prophets, and lastly, plainly revealed by the Gospel, when our Savior
commands to baptize in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy
Ghost. A number of such like places might be alleged out of his works,
wherein most constantly he avouches that doctrine which our and his unequal
adversaries accuse him to be an enemy unto. Let envy it self now be judge,
whether this be not a slander, when as they both falsisy those sayings, out of
which they would derive their accusation, and conceal those which they knew to
be a just defense and apology for his innocence.

75. Again they condemn Beza, and Martyr, and other 6. Posseuine de notis
verb. divine. l. 3. c. cap. 8.
Protestants for denying the omnipotency of God: and why? because forsooth they
say, Quod facta vt infecta sint facere nequeat; He cannot make those things
that be done, to be undone. An absurd inference: for that assertion, that God
can not make those things that be done, to be undone, does not destroy, but
build up the omnipotency of God: seeing as Bellarmine Bell. de Euchar. l. 1. c.
14.
himself acknowledges, Facere contradictoria, non est efficere, sed deficere;
to do things contradictorie, is not to effect and do, but to fail and undo:
and therefore an argument of impotency, rather then of omnipotency: and for
that cause Pererius another Jesuit avouches the same doctrine Perer. com. in
Genesis 17.
with us in these words; God is said to be omnipotent, not only because he can
do whatsoever is contained in the world, but also because nothing is impossible
unto him, except that, which to be done implies contradiction: what an
impudent flander then is this, to say that we deny Gods omnipotency, by
affirming, that he cannot make that to be undone, which is done? especially,
seeing we say further with Tertullian and Saint Tertul. aduers. Prax. c. 10.
Aug. de ciuit. l. 5. c. 10.
Augustine, that therefore God cannot do it, because he will not do it: he
cannot therefore deny himself, not make that to be undone, which is done,
because he will not; and he will not, because it would rather be an argument
of weakness, then a power in him so to do.

76. Again, they challenge Calvin of denying the immortality of the soul.
And why think you? Because they would make him to say, that the souls of the
just are kept in certain secret receptacles, till the day of Judgment, and
do not till then enjoy the presence of God. Another palpable slander: for
first Calvin does not say so: secondly, if he did, yet it does not follow
thereupon, that he denies the immortality of the soul: for the first, let
Calvin first speak for himself, and then let his adversaries also speak for
him. Touching the place where the souls of the just remain after death, he
affirms plainly in diverse places, that they live with God, and enjoy the
happy felicity of his kingdom, though Calvin. aduers. libertin. c. 22. and in
Psychoparmibia, and com. in 2. Cor. 5. 8.
their perfect happiness is deferred, till the second coming of Christ, when
their bodies and souls shall be reunited, and made partakers of the same
blessedness. This he testifies not in one or two, but in many places: how
therefore can they lay to his charge, that opinion, touching secret
receptacles, where souls are reserved till the day of the resurrection?

77. Mary (says Bellarmine) in two respects: first, because he makes Christ
alone to have entered into the Sanctuary Bell. de beatitud. Sanct. l. 2. c. 1.
of heaven, and there to present the prayers of the people; resting in the
utter court, to God: and secondly, because he says, that the Saints departed
are joined together with us by faith: therefore (says Bellarmine) He must
needs deny that they see God, seeing Idem lib. 1. c. 1.
where faith is, there is not sight. But his conclusion in both is false,
though the premises be true: for as the Atrium, or utter Court of the Temple,
to which Calvin alludeth, was a part of the Temple: so by proportion, the
utter Court of Heaven is a part of Heaven: witness their own Ribera,
expounding Ribera i^ Exodus 28.
that place of Exodus, whereunto Calvin alludeth: and therefore Calvin, if
he did say so, does not banish the just souls out of Heaven, but only
places Christ our high Priest, betwixt God and them. But what if he speak
only of the Saints living, and not departed, and mean by the utter Court, not
any part of Heaven, but the Church militant Calvin. Instit. l. 3. c. 20.
here on earth? If this be true, what shameless slaunderers are these
fellows, to wring a sense out of Calvin, whereof there is no show in the
words? let the place be consulted and viewed, and their malice and impudency
will appear most notorious.

78. Again, that faith which he speaks of in the second place, is nothing
else, but their steadfast belief and expectation of the resurrection of their
bodies, which lives in the faithful souls separated from this mortality,
until the full accomplishment of their happiness, as well as in the Saints
militant: neither can I conceive any absurdity in this, that the Saints
departed should have faith in this respect, seeing they must needs have hope:
which two Theological virtues are so perplexed together, that one cannot be
without the other: and therefore Clemens Alexandrinus calls hope the blood of
faith: and Saint Paul says, 1. Cor. 13. that faith and hope shall cease
together, when charity shall survive and remain. If then the Saints departed
hope for the resurrection of their bodies, why may they not be said also to
believe it, and yet for all that be in heaven too?

79. Neither is the other place objected out of Calvin by Calvin. Instit. l.
3. c. 25.. 6.
Bellarmine any whit repugnant to this doctrine; for though he says, that it
is a foolish and rash part to dispute curiously, what the place is, that the
Saints possess in Heaven, and whether they enjoy the full joys of heaven, or
no: yet in the very same place he affirms, that they are in the presence of
Christ in Paradise, and that they only expect the fruition of that promised
glory, which their bodies also shall be possessors of, at the coming of Christ.

80. Thus we have heard Calvin speak for himself. Let us now hear his
enemies, speaking for him in this case, then which there cannot be a stronger
argument of his innocence: Bell. de Christ^. l. 4. c. 15.
and in this, two may stand for all. Bellarmine is the first, he directly
confesses, that Calvin placed the souls of the Saints in heaven, even before
the coming of Christ; and to him subscribeth Fenardentius, another Jesuit,
who affirms that this Feuard. Theomach. l. 8. c. 8.
was Caluines opinion, that the faithful, when they should depart out of this
world, do behold God near unto them, and as it were set before their eyes.
And thus Calvin is quit from this enditement by the witness of his professed
adversaries.

81. Secondly, let it be granted (which nevertheless can no ways be proved)
that Calvin held this opinion, touching the residence of souls in some secret
place; yet it does not follow, that therefore he denied the immortality of the
soul. For then Origin, Iustine, Martyr, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Vasques tom. 1.
in Thom. disp. 19 c. 1. nu. 1. Staplet. de author. Script. l. 1. c 2. Sixth.
Senens. biblioth. l. 9.
Lactantius, Victorinus, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophilact, Ambrose, Bernard,
and diverse others of the ancient godly Fathers, should be enwrapped within the
same error, who all held that opinion touching souls departed, and yet were
as far from gainsaying, or once imagining any opposition to the souls
immortality, as these backbiting Shemi^s are from charity and truth.

82. Another loud and lewd slander of theirs against our Religion, is, that
it maintains and warranteth rebellion and disobedience against lawful
Princes. Which if they could prove, we would confess that our Religion was
naught, seeing Gods word commands every soul to be subject Romans 13. 1.
to the higher powers: but yet not worse then theirs, which is, without all
contradiction, guilty of this crime, which they impute unto us, as has been
proved: but let us hear their proofs: they are of two sorts; first, from the
doctrines of some of our learned writers; and secondly, from the practice of
our professors: In the first kind they object Calvin, Beza, Luther, Knox,
Buchanan, Goodman; yea and Munster also with his Anabaptists: all which let us
briefly examine, and begin with the last, and so go backward.

83. Munster with his Anabaptists, maintained indeed such rebellious doctrines:
but were they Protestants? or did ever any Protestant give credit, countenance
or allowa^ce unto the^? No, Bellarmine himself confesses the contrary, when
he says, that the opinion of the heretical Anabaptists, was abhorred Bell.
de Laicis l. 3. c. 2.
not only of Catholics, but also of Calvin. Yea Calvin and Luther wrote
each of them a book against their impieties. It is impious wickedness then
for any to object to Protestants, the opinion of those rebellious and giddy
Anabaptists.

84. Touchng Goodman, Knox and Buchanan, we ingeniously confess, that the two
last went too far in diminishing the authority of Princes, and that the first
was impious in animating subjects against their Sovereigns: but withal, we
give them to know this, that they are condemned of all good men in this their
rebellious assertion: and that by a public Act of Parliament in Scotland,
Buchanans books was called Anno 1584.
in, and censured as contrary to sound doctrine: and the like censure is given
by all godly Protestants, against Knox, or any other that maintain the like.

85. And now I would feign understand of these fellows, what are these three
in comparison of the whole Church of Protestants, that they should blemish our
Religion by their exorbitant opinions; and to the many hundred of Protestant
writers, that abhor all such doctrine, and clearly avouch the contrary. If
it be a good plea in them, to say, that the opinion of some private men ought
not to prejudice the Religion of the whole Church; then it may also by good
right serve our turns in the case of these three, seeing the rule of equity
requires vt feras legem quam fers, that every one should be subject to that
Law which he himself makes. In sum, here are with us but three, that can be
touched: but with them are multitudes, not only of inferior Priests and
Jesuits, but of Cardinals and Popes, that are guilty of this crime: ours, are
private men condemned by all others: with them, public persons authorized by
their places and chayres, and privileged from error: with us, writings of no
authority: with them, Bulls, decrees, and books with privilege and public
allowance. Lastly, with us, the whole stream of our Religion tends to the
maintenance of obedience, and condemning of all treason and rebellion: but with
them the very grounds of their Religion do warrant and uphold the contrary, as
is manifestly proved heretofore.

86. Concerning Luther, Calvin and Beza, how far they were from this
pernicious doctrine, let their own words and writings testify: Luther first:
Government (says he) is a certain Luther tom. 5. in Genesis cap. 27.
divine virtue: and therefore God calls all Magistrates gods, not for
creation, but for administration and government, which belongs only to God:
therefore he that is a ruler, is as it were a god incarnate. Again, in another
place; We do not flatter Idem tom. 3. in Genesis cap. 33.
the Magistrates, when we style them most gracious, and most mighty: but from
the heart we reverence their order, and their persons ordained to this office.
And in another place; Though Idem tom. 1. in Genesis cap. 9.
some think (says he) the government of man over man to be a tyrannous
usurpation; because all men are naturally of like condition: yet we that have
the word of God, must oppose the commandment and ordinance of God, who has
put a sword into the hand of the Magistrate, whom therefore the Apostle calls
Gods Ministers.

87. Calvin in diverse places delivers this doctrine: that Calvin. Instit.
lib. 4. cap. 20.
not only good and godly Kings are to be obeyed, but also wicked ones, because
in them is stamped and engraven the image of divine Majesty: neither can any
one sentence be picked and culled out of all his books, yea, though it be
strayned to the uttermost, and wrung till it bleed, that but sauoureth of
rebellion: except that may, perhaps, which he speaks concerning an impious
King, that rises up against God, and seeks to rob him of his right: how such
a one does bereave Idem com. in Dan. 6. 22.
himself of his authority, and is rather to be spit at then obeyed. But this
also being rightly understood, makes nothing to that purpose: for first, he
does not say that such an one is to be bereaved of his authority, but that he
bereaueth himself: and secondly he means, that he is rather to be spit at
and defiled, then to be obeyed in that particular, wherein he commands any
thing contrary to the dignity and majesty of God. What hurt now, I pray you,
is in this doctrine? Or rather what sound truth is not in it? save that there
is a little harshnesse of phrase, which might have been well omitted: and yet
this is all that the Romish adversaries can charge Calvin withal.

88. Lastly, for Beza, if I should produce all his excellent sayings, whereby
he does maintain the authority of Princes, and obedience of subjects: I should
trouble the Reader too long: let this suffice, that his greatest enemies cannot
object against him, any one thing tending to the impeachment of Royal
authority, except they grossly belly him, which is no new thing with them;
lies and slanders being one of the chief props of their Kingdom. Thus our
doctrine affords them no hold for this accusation.

89. Again, they challenge Calvin for imputing unto our Lord and Savior some
stain of sin; not by express words, but by consequence: because he said,
that when in the Bell. de Christo lib. 4. cap. 1.
garden he prayed, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,
nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou will: he corrected and revoked his
prayer suddenly uttered: therefore (say they) he must be tainted with sin,
seeing he did something that might be corrected: the like crime they lay to the
charge of Luther, and all other learned Protestants, for saying Ibid.
that in Christ's humane nature there was some ignorance residing, and that he
grew up, and increased in knowledge, and had not the full measure of knowledge
at his birth, as they would have it. We grant the premises to be true, to wit,
that this is the doctrine of Calvin, Luther, and other learned Protestants:
but nevertheless we say, that the conclusion is a malicious slander: for
first, many of the fathers, yea most, were of the same opinion with us: as also
some of the popish Doctors themselves, that there was ignorance in Christ, and
that his knowledge grew and increased together with his age, according to that
of Saint Luke: He increased in wisdom Luke 2. 52.
and stature, and in favor with God and men. And yet none of them did once
imagine, that this was in him either a sin or a fruit of sin; grounding
upon that text of Scripture, Heb. 4. 15. that Christ was like unto us in all
things, sin only excepted: nor ever was that error imputed unto them for
that cause. Hear some of them speak in their own words. Ambrose says thus.
How Christ increased in wisdom Ambrose de Incar. cap. 7.
the order of the words does teach, his proceeding in age, is his proceeding in
wisdom. And therefore Saint Luke sets his growth in age. First, that thou
might know that it is spoken of him as he is man. And Chrysostom thus, The
wisemen gave Chrysest. in Mat. 2. hom. 2.
honor not to his childhood, understanding nothing, but to his divinity
knowing all things: and Maldonate does confess, that Maldon. com. in Mat. 24.
Athanasius, Gregory, Nazianzene, Theodoret, Cyril, and the author of the
imperfect work on Matthew, did al teach, that Christ as man, was ignorant of
the day of Judgment. Neither do these fathers alleged by Bellar. for the
contrary opinion, in truth deliver any thing else, if they be rightly
understood: for most of them, when they say, that our Savior was full of
grace, knowledge and wisdom, from his very conception, and that he did not
increase and grow therein as other men, they speak either of his person in the
concret, or of his divine nature apart, as their own words alleged by him
do clearly show. And to this opinion Thomas Aquinas, their grand Schooleman
and angellical Doctor, sets Aquin. part. 3. q. 9. art. 4.
his hand and seal. For thus he writes, Though I have elsewhere written
otherwise, yet it is to be said (says be) that in Christ there was scientia
acquisita: knowledge acquired or gotten, which is properly knowledge according
to the measure of man: and that not only in respect of the subject receiving,
but also of the cause agent, etc.

90. Secondly, al ignorance is not sin by the doctrine of their own school.
For that ignorance which is called purae negationis of pure negation, does not
oppugn the state of innocence, seeing that it was in Ada^ before his fall, and
is now in the Angels in their perfection, and may be in any without the spot of
sin: as witness Lumbard, Aquinas, Pererius and al their learned Perer. com. in
Genesis 6. disp. 4. Suarez. tom. 1. Thom. q. 9. art. 1. disp. 24.
Doctors for the most part: yea their Jesuit Suarez tells us, it is not to
be called ignorance at al. Because ignorance (says he) does not signify every
want of knowledge, but the priuatio^ of that knowledge, which ought to be in a
subject according to the state of the nature thereof: as man is not to be
called ignorant, because he wants angellicall knowledge, so Christ was
ignorant of none of these things; which was behoofefull for him to know, in
respect of the dignity of his person: so that of two kinds of ignorance, one,
of pure negation; that is, when a man knows not some thing, which he is not
bound to know, and the other of wicked disposition, when a man is (...) of
something which he ought to know. This last is a sin, but not the first: and
therefore to say that Christ was ignorant of some things in his humane nature,
and that he increased in knowledge, as in age, is not to impute unto him any
blot either of original or actual sin.

91. For the other part of the objection, wherewith Calvin is touched,
concerning our Saviors correcting of his own speech, it is no other then that
which Jerome before him many hundred years uttered; and Origin also, two
famous fathers of the Primitive Church: the one affirming, that Christ
returning to himself, avouched, that as he was the Hierome. Origin. tract. in
Mat.
Son of God, which he had staggeringly spoken, as he was a man: the other,
that he recalled his desire, and as it were thinking better upon it, said, Not
as I will: yea they themselves acknowledge as much, for Bellarmine says, that
when our Savior Bell. de Christ* lib. 4. cap. 5.
prayed, Let this cup pass from me, but not as I will, but as thou will, it
was as much as if he should have said: Volo vt non fiat voluntate naturali quod
voluntate deliberata volo vt fiat: I will that it may not come to pass, to
wit, by my natural will, which by my deliberate will, I desire may come to
pass. Here is a plain correction, as Calvin calls it, or a returning to
himself, as Hierome; or a reuocation of his natural desire by a more advised
desire, as Origin: the like interpretation is given by Iansenius, Pererius and
Maldonate; all agreeing in t^is, that they admit of a correction and reuocation
of his natural, inferior, humane will, by his spiritual, superior, divine
will: and yet without all blemish and suspicion of sin; this correction
presuposing no corruption. So that either Calvin must be excused, or
themselves must be inwrapped within the folds of the same fault. But this is
their rancour against that good man, and all other of our side, that which is
orthodox in the Fathers, and themselves, is notwithstanding heresy in us;
because they look upon us through the spectacle of malice, but upon themselves
with the eyes of self-love.

92. And to clear him altogether, and rid him out of their hands, the most
received doctrine both by Calvin and Perkins on the Creed.
all our whole Church concerning this point is; that this was not in our
Savior Christ, either a rebellion of the sensual part of the soul against
the rational; as Per^rius makes it, which is in the unregenerate, nor of the
flesh against the spirit, as Iansenius would have it, which is in the
regenerate, nor a repugnance of Christ's will as he was a man, to his will as he
was God, which Maldonate s^emeth to affirm: but only the strife of two
contrary desires in the humane soul of Christ for dominion, both which
notwithstanding were good and holy, though the one not so good as the other,
and in that respect, this desire to avoid death, which was the less, might
without any great offense, be said to be corrected, when it yielded unto that
other which was more excellent.

92. Lastly (to omit a number more of their sslanders in this kind) they charge
our Religion it self, to lead to looseness and sensuality by diverse
doctrines thereof: especially these four, to wit, freewill, justification by
faith alone, perseverance in grace; and impossibility to keep the
Commandments: but with what spirit of malice, let the indifferent Reader
consult and judge.

93. First, for our doctrine touching the inabilitie of freewill, does it lead
a man to looseness? nay, rather does it not teach him to deny himself, and to
seek for all grace and goodness from God? humility and prayer are the fruits
of this doctrine, and not loosnesse and liberty: and to make it clear to any
single eye: We teach that a man is only void of freewill to grace before his
regeneration, and that he is passive only in the very act of regeneration:
but after his will being quickened, and stirred up by Gods spirit, he wills
and works forth together with the spirit of God, his own salvation. Now, few
or none there are, that are Christians, but presume, though falsely, that they
are regenerate: and therefore this doctrine cannot give liberty to any to
sin, but rather binds them fast to obedience; nay, does not their doctrine
rather open a gappe to liberty? For when they teach, that it is in a man's
power either to accept or reject the grace of God offered unto him: What does
this but encourage men to defer their repentance and conversion, seeing it is
in their power to accept it when they list?

94. Secondly, how can the doctrine of justification by 11.
faith alone tend to looseness, seeing we teach, that faith is never severed
from good works, nor justification from sanctification, nor a right belief
from an upright life, as has been showed, and that they which sever and part
those things which God has coupled together, sever themselves from the mercy
of God, and merit of Jesus Christ? With what brow of brass then can they call
this a solifidian portion, and a doctrine of liberty? I, but many take
liberty hereby to lead a loose and wicked life, building upon this ground,
that they are justified by faith alone, and so they neglect all good works.
True indeed, many such there are: but is it from our doctrine? is it not rather
from their mistaking of it? So the Capernaites took offense at our Savior
Christ's heavenly doctrine, Ioh. 6. touching the spiritual eating of his flesh,
and drinking his blood: insomuch that many of them departed from him: was his
doctrine therefore erroneous? or were not they rather ignorant in
misconstruing, and impious in perverting the same? So is it with this mystery
of justification, which is the very doctrine of Jesus Christ: if any by
mistaking it, or by taking up one piece of it, and leaving another, do animate
themselves unto sin, is the doctrine to be blamed? and not they rather, that
distort it to their own shame and confusion? In a word, if this were a just
exception against this doctrine, then no doctrine either of their or ours, or
the Gospel it self might be freed from this challenge. For as there is no
herb so sweet and wholesome, but the Spider may suck poison out of it, as well
as the Be honey: so there is no truth so sacred and holy, but an ungodly mind
may pervert and make it an occasion of his impiety. Thus, the grace of God is
turned into wantonness by many (as Saint Jude says:) the Iud. 1. 4.
word of God is the savor of death unto death. Yea, Christ Jesus our blessed
Lord and Savior is a falling, and a stone to 1. Pet. 2. 8.
stumble at, and a rock of offense: so the doctrine of Justification by faith
alone, may be an occasion of liberty and no otherwise: that is not properly,
or by any effect issuing from itself, but accidentally, and by the malignitie
of the object whereupon it works.

95. Thirdly, our doctrine of perseverance, though railing 12.
Wright says of it, that Epicurus himself could not have found a better
ground to plant his Epicurisme: nor Heliogabalus have better patronized his
sensuality: nor Bacchus and Venus have forged better reasons to enlarge their
dominion: yet, to any single eye (for his eyes are double-sighted with malice,
as Witches eyes are said to be) it is rather a strong bridle to restrain from
sensuality and Epicurisme, and a bond to bind to obedience, then a provocation
unto sin: for when men are persuaded that sincere faith, true charity, and
saving grace cannot be lost, it will cause them to take heed how they fall
away, lest they prove themselves to have been hypocrites before, and their
faith and charity not to have been true, but fained: for he that falls from
God whom he pretend: d to serve, to the Devil by an actual Apostasy into
sin, plainly proves that he had never the seed of the spirit sown in him,
nor the habit of charity in his soul: this is then a bridle to withhold men
from sin, and not a spur to prick them forward unto it. And therefore
whereas they say that men will thus reason: If I be the child o^ God, I cannot
fall away: therefore I will do what I list. The contrary is rather true, that
every child of GOD, yea, every one that is persuaded that he is the child of
GOD, will reason thus from the grounds of this doctrine: I will not do what I
list, neither will I give my self over unto sin, lest I prove my self by my
falling into sin, not to be the child of God, but an hypocrite. Add
hereunto, that as we teach, that true faith and charity cannot be utterly
extinct in the elect: So also we teach, that this faith and charity must be
nourished and preserved by the practice of all holy and Christian duties: and
therefore they which neglect the conservation of their faith, and charity, and
seek to extinguish them by the lusts of the flesh, it is a sign that they
never had these graces in grafted in their souls. And what persuasion can be
more effectual, I pray you, to stir up men unto godliness, then this is?

96. So we may truly answer concerning the fourth doctrine 13.
objected, namely, the impossibility of keeping Gods Commandments, which
though it be true in some part, albeit, not as they slanderously impute unto
us. For we hold that the regenerate person is able in some measure to keep
Gods Commandments, though not to that perfection which the Law requires,
exacting of every one of us the love of God with all our heart, soul and
strength; yet this opens not, but rather stops the gap unto fleshly
liberty. For, is any man so mad as to say, I will give over all care of
keeping Gods Law, because I am not able fully and exactly to perform it?
rather every one that has but a reasonable soul will thus determine, Because
I am not able to perform perfect obedience to God, therefore I will endeavor
to do what I can, that my imperfections and wants may be made up by the
perfect obedience of my Savior. All men will account him a wilful wicked
wretch, who being greatly indebted, because he is not able to discharge the
whole sum, therefore will take no care to pay any part thereof, which he is
able to do, but lay all upon his sureties back: so we condemn him for a
desperate and damnable person, that, because he is not able to satisfy the
whole debt of Gods Commandments, therefore will not endeavor to pay as much as
he can: besides, we teach withal, that though this perfection be not attained
unto in this life, yet there must be a continual growth and increase in grace
and goodness in all that belong to God, that at length, after this life ended,
they may doff off the old man, with the inabilities and corruptions thereof,
and attain to the highest degree of perfection in the life to come: the fruit
of this doctrine then, is not sensual liberty, but Christian humility, not a
provocation to sin, but an incentiue, and spur unto godliness.

97. Thus I have propounded unto the view of the Christian Reader, a short
Epitome of the great volume of their slanders, darted forth by them, both
against our persons, our government, and our Religion it self: all which
indeed is but a taste and say of that, which might be spoken in this subject,
and which requires an entire work for the discovering of there malice in this
kind: and surely, I think that labor might be well bestowed in searching
this stinking puddie to the bottom, and discovering their malice, so to the
beholding of all, that men might see their poison, and beware of such Serpents:
and high time it is to lay hand to this plough; for a double danger arises
from this dealing of theirs. First, it confirms their own followers in their
hatred against the truth, and the professors thereof. For they are persuaded,
that whatsoever is written or spoken by a Priest or Jesuit, is certainly true,
it being allowed (as all their writings commonly are) by the authority of the
Church, and the Censors and visiters appointed for that purpose, and therefore
account it a deadly sin once to call the credit thereof into question. And
secondly it inueigleth and seduceth many unsettled Protestants: Whilst reading
such lying Pamphlets, they are either not able to discern their falsehood, or
not careful to examine the truth by contrary evidences: to prevent both which
dangers, it would be a work much beneficial to the Church of God, and
profitable to the cause of Religion, if some zealous Protestant would undertake
this task, in a full just volume to decipher their malice, and discover their
slanders to the full: but I leave that to the guidance of Gods wisdom, and
proceed in my purposed discourse to the next point.

98. Their last trick is forgerie, for when neither by treachery, nor cruelty,
nor perjury, nor lying, nor sla^dering, they can work their wills, but that
their Religion grows every day more odious then others, at last as the most
desperate practice of al^^he rest, they fall to forging like Physicions, that
seeing their patient in a desperate case, minister unto him desperate
medicines, that shall either rid him of his disease, or of his life, and that
quickly: such a medicine is this, which if it take not place to cure their
sick Religion, it will doubtless utterly ruin and undermine the foundation
thereof, and deprive it of the vital spirit. And this last we have rather
cause to hope, then they the first: seeing it has pleased God to reveal to
the world the mischievous mysteries of their Indices expurgatory: which
whosoever shall but duly consider, must needs judge their cause to lie a
bleeding, and ready to give up the ghost, when they are driven to such
miserable shifts for the defense thereof.

99. The common Laws, and civil Courts punish forgerers with slitting their
noses, branding their foreheads, cutting off their ears, pillorie,
imprisonment, and diverse other such like fearful censures: the
Ecclesiastical Laws are as severe against such persons; and the very Heathen.
Tully condemned Gabinius as a light and loose person, for infringing the credit
of the public Records of the City, and commends Metellus as a most holy and
modest man, because when he saw a name but blurred in the tables, he went to
Lentulus Cicer. orat. pro Archia P^eta.
the Praetor, and desired a reformation thereof, and a better care to be had in
their custody. By all which we may see how great and odious a crime forgerie
is; and in what rank they are to be reputed by all Laws, that defile their
consciences with so foul a sin.

100. Of which, that the Church of Rome is guilty, is so manifest, that none,
that has either read their Books of Controversies with judgment, or seen
their three chief Iudices Expurgatorij, one of Rome, another of Spain, the
third of Antwerp, can make any question. And if any desire to be fully
satisfied concerning their dealing in this kind, let them have recourse to
Doctor James his learned and laborious discourse, where he shall see this wound
searched to tho quick, and the corruption thereof discovered to the whole
world, and so searched and discovered, that by all their wit and policy they
shall never be able to hide the filthiness thereof: notwithstanding, that the
Reader that has not that book, may have a little taste of their dealing, and
assurance of the truth of this my proposition: I will offer unto his view a few
instances of their forgerie, and those so plain and palpable, that by no
colorable excuse they can be avoided.

101. Forgerie is committed two ways, first, by counterfeiting, secondly, by
corrupting; counter^^i^ing (...) Records, and corrupting true. Touching
counterfeiting, take four instances in s^eed of fourscore; and those out of
Bellarmine Bell. de amiss. great. lib. 6. cap. 2.
only: first, those ^^el^e Trea^is^^ entitled, ^^ (...) Christi operibus, are
resolutely censured by Bellarmine, to be none of Cyprians, and yet, the same
Bellarmine alleges them ordinarily to prove many points of his Religion,
under Cyprians name; as to prove the Virgin Marie to be without sin, and
Baptism to be necessary to salvation, and that the Sacraments contain grace
in them, and that there are more Sacraments then two, with diverse other points.
Secondly, the Commentaries upon Paul's Epistles ascribed unto Saint Ambrose,
Bell. de Christo l. 1. c. 10. and de Cleric. lib. 1. cap. 15.
are censured by Bellarmine, peremptorily to be counterfeit. And yet, the same
Bellarmine produces them to prove traditions, Peter's supremacy, Limbus
Patrum: that one may be helped by another merit, and that Antichrist is a
certain man, and in a word, most questions controuerted. Thirdly, liber
Hypognosticon, Bellarmine concludes, that it is none of Saint Augustines, yet
he alleges it as Saint Augustines, Idem de miss. lib. 2. cap. 12.
to prove Evangelical Councels: so Liber ad Orosium is confessed by
Bellarmine, to be none of Saint Augustines, and yet he is alleged by him in
another place, to prove the Book of Ecclesiasticus authentical. Lastly, the
Commentaries upon the Epistles that go under the name of Saint Jerome, are
judged by Bellarmine to be none of his, and yet he produces testimonies out
of them, to prove the necessity of traditions, Peter to be the rock of the
Church, and that children may without their parents consents enter into a
religious Order. And this is ordinary, not only in Bellarm but in all other
of their writers, as you may see particularly and plainly discovered in Doctor
James his Treatise, touching the corrupting of Scripture. Councels and Fathers,
by the Prelates and pillars of the Church of Rome. By which we may note:
First, their conscience, in that they know them to be Bastards, and yet obtrude
them as true borne. Secondly, their fraud, in that when they make little for
them, or it may be against them, then they brand them with counterfeit: but
when they speak on their behalf, then they are as true as steel: and thus
with a blunder of counterfeit Fathers, they dazzle the eyes of the ignorant: but
the wise will judge discreetly, and learn to discern the Lion by his paw.

102. Touching their corrupting of true Authors, I will urge against them but
four examples as in the former: but those most famous, and three of them
corrupted by their most famous Jesuit Bellarmine. The first is of Chrysostom,
in his seventeenth Homily upon Genesis, where he reads, She Bell. de verb.
Dei, lib. 2. cap. 12.
shall observe thy head, and thou shall observe her heel: whereas, as Philip
Montanus a learned and judicious Divine of their own confesses, in the
original tongue of Chrysostom it is read (...), he, and not (...) she, which
is also agreeable to the Hebrew and Greek fountains of the Bible. O, but
because this reading in the translated Copy makes for the worship of the
Virgin Mary, therefore in our Jesuits divinity it must be preferred. The
second is out of Chrysostom too, in his Sermon of Inuentius and Maximus, whom
Bellarmine, to prove Bell. de Relig. Sanct. l. 2. c. 3.
that the relickes of Saints ought to be worshipped, brings in thus speaking,
tumulos Martyrum adoremus, let us worship the sepulchers of Martyrs: whereas
indeed, the word in Chrysostom is adornemus: let us adorn and garnish their
sepulchers: as both the original Greek and the Latin translations, that are
of any standing, do read it. The third is of Cyril, who is not only changed
and altered, but plainly dismembered by them: for whereas he writes thus
excellently concerning the power of faith: This faith which is the gift Cyril
in Esaias lib. 1. cap. 1.
and grace of God, is sufficient to cleanse and purge, not only them which find
themselves somewhat ill, but also those which are very Index Hispan. Gaspar
Qui reg. page 62.
dangerously diseased, etc. The Spanish Index has censured him, and commanded
these words to be blotted out, with this peremptory charge, Extextu deleantur
illa verba. The fourth and last is of Cyprian in his Book, De bono patientiae,
Cyprian. de bono patientiae. Bell de Euchar. lib. 2. cap. 28.
where, for gustatam Eucharistiam, they read, to maintain the idolatrous
circumgestation of the Eucharist, gestatam: contrary to their own copies: as
on the contrary, in Leo ser. 14. de passione, for gestemus, Bellarmine reads
gustemus: and thus they turn Cat in pan, as the Proverb says, and with the
Apothecaries art, put quid pro qu^.

103. Thus they handle the Fathers, putting words into their mouths that they
never spoke nor meant, and that in no few places of their, writings. And as for
later Writers, their Iudices Expurgatorij are sufficient testimonies of their
purging, expunging, wiping out, and foysting in what they list into their
Books: it is a professed, allowed and maintained practice of theirs, which at
the first was kept in darkness, as a work of darkness by secret conueyance:
but after that by Gods providence it came to light, is now publicly defended
as a thing not only lawful and commendable in it self, but also profitable
for the Church of God, so that there needs no further proof of their forgerie
and falsification in this kind, seeing we have confitentes adversaries. Only
for a conclusion, let us a little consider the reasons that are used by these
good men, for the defense of this their dealing.

104. One May an English Priest out of Gretzer, and Posseuine, Grounds of the
old and new Religion.
the author (as it is supposed) of the grounds of the old and new Religion, in
the latter end of that Book, taking upon him to answer Master Crashaw, that
laid to their charge the same crime that I now do, answers three ways.
First, that it is a practice both lawful and commendable. Secondly, that if it
be unlawful, we are more guilty of it then they. And lastly, though they
meddle with new Writers, yet the Fathers works are sincere and free from all
corruption.

105. To whom I reply briefly thus, that as touching his last answer which
concerns the Fathers, it is manifestly false, as I have already discovered
in four particulars, and is by Doctor James in his Book in many more, and I
doubt not but shall be more fully ere long made known to the world: and
therefore, though that there was no rule prescribed by the Council of Trent,
for the purging of the Fathers; as of younger Writers: Yet it follows not but
that they might do it without rule, which also Gretzer the Jesuit perceiving
Gretzer de iure and more prohib. lib. 2. c. 9. and 10. page 321. 328.
to be true, seeks to mend the matter by a fine distinction, by which indeed
he matres it utterly, and that is that the Fathers works, as they are Fathers,
need no purging, but being considered as Sons, their words may be corrected
and censured by the Church; or not as Fathers, but as Fathers-in-law; Non vt
patres, sed vt vitrici.
for when they feed the Church with sound and wholesome doctrine, they are
Fathers: if otherwise, Fathers-in-law: thus by this fine distinction he
grants, that when a Father speaks any thing which they account false
doctrine, he may be corrected, or rather corrupted, for then they esteem him
not a Father but a son: nor a true Father, but a Father-in-law; so that it is
apparently false, which our new Author affirms, that none of the Fathers are
corrected by them.

106. Secondly, touching his middle answer, that if it be a fault, we are more
guilty thereof then they. I answer, that that is as false as the former, for
let it be granted, that some Books are corrected by some Protestants; yet
first, they are the deeds of private persons, and not the acts of the Church,
not at all approved, much less authorized by the Church, as theirs are: nay,
all of sounder judgment in our Church do as much condemn that practice in our
own, as in any else. Secondly, such corruptions or corrections are not
frequent with us, but rare and seldom. I dare boldly say, for one place
altered by us in any Writer, there are twenty by them, as their own expurging
Iudices do bear witness: and for this, I challenge any Jesuit, or Romish
Priest whatsoever to the encounter. Thirdly, most of those Books which they
lay to our charge, to have been corrupted by us, as Augustines Meditations,
Grenades Meditations, The conversion of a Sinner, The Christian Directorie,
Osianders Enchiridion, with other more, are not corrected in the original
themselves, but in their translations into our Language, some things are left
out, some added, some changed and altered, as the Translators thought good;
whereas they corrupt the very Texts and original Copies of most Writers
without difference. Fourthly, we seldom alter or change any Book in the
translation, but withal we either confess in the beginning of the said
Books, or profess in the publishing of the same, this correction or
alteration: but they have practiced this in secret, by certain Enquisitors
appointed to that purpose, the mystery of which art was long hid from the
World, and had still lien in darkness, had not the providence of God, for the
Iunius praefat. in* Indic. Belgia.
good of the Church, first discovered the Belgicke Index by mere accident to
that godly and bright star of our Church, Iunius, who made it presently
known to the world: and at this day few there are that understand the
mysteries of that art: so closely and cunningly do they convey their matters:
as for the Books themselves they do seldom or never acknowledge their
correction in the forefront and beginning of them as we do, but by all means
labor to hide and conceal the same. Lastly, though some amongst us, have more
rashly, then wisely, falsified some Writers of lesser note, in some few things:
yet they have not meddled with the Fathers nor Councels: neither have they done
it, to gain any thing thereby in disputation, but only to keep the common
people from infection: whereas they spare none, neither Fathers nor Councels,
nor modern Writers: and that, not so much lest the common sort should be
infected, as that the learned might be deprived of those weapons wherewith they
might fight against them, and wound their cause. Seeing the case now so stands,
that he which can muster up together the greatest army of Authors, to fight
under his colors, is thought to have the best cause: their dealing then with
us, is like that of the Philistims against the Israelites, who despoyled them
of all weapons and instruments of war, that they might dominiere over them
with greater security; but ours is not so toward them. And therefore, both in
this, and all the former respects, it is a miserable untruth and a desperate
cuasion, to say, that we are more guilty of this crime then they are.

107. Lastly, whereas in his first answer, he pleads the lawfulness of the
fact, let us hear his reasons to move thereunto, and in the interim remember,
that in proving it to be lawful, he confesses it to be done. But why is it
lawful? Mary, first, because the Church being supreme Judge on earth, of all
Controversies touching faith and Religion, has authority to condemn
Heretics. And therefore also, the works of Heretics: and if this, then much
more to correct and purge their Books, if by that means she can make them
profitable for her use, and beneficial to her children. To which I answer two
things* First, that it is not the Church that does this, but the sacred
Inquisitors, to wit, certain Cardinals and Lawyers deputed to that office, who
for the most part are so far from being the Church, that they are often, no
sound members thereof: I^ it be said, that they have their authority from the
Pope, who is vertually the whole Church: why do they then speak so darkly,
and say the Church has this authority, when as, they might in plain terms
say that the Pope has it; but that hereby they should display the feebleness
of their cause, and the fillinesse of this reason? for thus it would stand:
Why, is it lawful for Books to be purged? because the Pope thinks it lawful.
And must not he needs think so* when the Authors cross his triple crown, and
speak against his state and dignity? Add hereunto, that it is a fallacy in
reasoning, when that is taken for granted, which is in question. For we deny
their Synagogue to be the true Church: and much more the Pope to be the
supreme Judge: and therefore till those things be proved, the reason is of no
effect.

108. Secondly, most of those things which are purged by them, are so far
from being heresies or errors, that they are, the most of them, sound
doctrines of faith, grounded upon the authority of Gods sacred truth: for they
blot out many things, in both old and new Authors, that they themselves dare
not accuse to be heretical: as that place in Saint Cyril before mentioned
touching the power of faith, which is no more in direct terms, then that which
is said in the Scripture, Act. 15. 15. that faith purifieth the heart: and that
in the Basil Index of Chrysostom, The Church is not built upon a man, Index
Expurgat. Belgic. p. 300 impre^^. Arg^^t.
but upon faith: and those propositions which are commanded by the Dutch Index,
to be wiped out of the Table of Robert Stephens Bible: to wit, that sins are
remitted by believing in Christ: that he which believes in Christ, shall not
die for ever; that faith purifieth the heart: that Christ is our righteousness:
that no man is just before God, and that repentance is the gift of God: with a
number of like nature. These they purge out of Stephens Index, which
notwithstanding are directly, and in as many words recorded in the Book of
God: and so it may justly be thought, that they are so far from clenfing
Books from the dross and dregs of error, that they rather purge out the pure
gold and clear wine of truth, and leave nothing but dregs and dross behind.

109. His second reason is, because nothing is more dangerous to infect true
Christian hearts, then bad Books. Therefore it is not only lawful, but
needful and behoouefull to the Church of God, that such Books should be
purged, and burned too, if it be so thought meet by the Church, to the end
that the sincerity of one true faith and Religion might be preserved. I
answer, all this is true which he says: but are they heresies which they
purge? no, they are sound and orthodox opinions, for the most part, as has
been proved in the answer to the former reason. And do they it, to keep
Christian men from infection? no, their chief end and drift is, to deprive
their adversaries of all authorities that make against them, that so they might
triumph in the antiquity of their Religion, and novelty of ours: which is one
of their principal arguments which they use (though with evil success) for
defense of their cause: dealing herein as Holofernes did with the Israelites,
at the siege of Bethulia, breaking the Conduits, cutting the pipes, and
slopping the passages, which might bring us provision of good and wholesome
waters, out of the cisternes of old and new Writers; this is their purpose and
no other, whatsoever they pretend: for if they meant any good to Gods people
for preventing of infection, they would have purged their lying Legends of
infinite fables, their Canon Law of horrible blasphemies, and their Schoolmen
of many strange opinions. Yea, they would have condemned the Books of
Machiauel, and of that Cardinal that wrote in commendation of the unnatural
sin of Sodomie, and a number such like filthy and deuillish Writings, which
are printed and reprinted among them without controulement. And again, is it
unity in the true faith and religion that they seek? no, it is conspiracy in
falsehood, and consent in error: and not unity in the truth: till the Romish
Religion be proved to be the true Religion (which can never be) this reason
is of no force, to justify their proceedings. Lastly, is it Christian policy?
no, it is deuilish subtletie, and crafty forgerie: for the case so stands
betwixt them and us, as in a trial of land betwixt party and party: wherein
he that brings best evidence and witness, carries the cause: now, if one
party either suborne false witnesses, or corrupt true, or forge evidences to
his purpose, or falsify those that are extant, all men will count him as a
forger, and his cause desperate, and judge him worthy the Pillorie: so betwixt
us the question is, who has the right faith, and the best title to the Church.
Our evidences are first and principally Gods Word, then the writings and
records of godly men in all ages: now then, they that shall purge, pare, raze,
blurr, falsify or corrupt any of these, must needs be thought to be subtle
and crafty companions, and not honest and plaindealing men. The case then thus
standing, this practice of theirs cannot be termed Christian policy, but plain
subtlety, to give it no worse a name.

110. His last reason is drawn from the practice of the Church of God in all
ages, which has always forbidden the Books of Heretics to be read, and
condemned them to the fire: and to this purpose he produces diverse fit and
pertinent authorities: to which I answer, first, that he fights herein
without an adversary: for we confess, that this was a necessary and
commendable practice, to prohibit, condemn, burn and abolish all such Books
as tend to the corrupting of the Christian faith, and also to prevent them in
the birth, that they may not come to light: but yet for all that, this allows
not their purging and paring of Books: for they cannot give us one example in
all antiquity of this dealing, except it be drawn from Heretics, whose
practice it has Bell. de verb. Dei, lib. 2. cap. 7. Idem de Pont. lib. 4. cap.
11. Sixtus Senens. biblioth lib. 4. 5. page 262.
been to deprave the Scriptures themselves, and the Decrees of Councels, and
the Books of ancient Fathers, as witnesses Bellarmine in many places of his
works, and Sixtus Senensis, and almost all other of their side.

III. Secondly, the Fathers condemned only the Books of Heretics: but our
holy Inquisitors condemn not only those whom they call Heretics, as Calvin,
Luther, Beza, Melancthon; but mangle and purge the Fathers themselves, and
their own dear children, whom they dare not condemn for Heretics, as this
Author himself confesleth; those they chop and change, wri^he and wring, bend
and bow as they list: which is so much the more intolerable, because being
professed Romanists, they durst not vary from the received opinions of the Church
of Rome, except mere conscience inwardly, and some forcible reason outwardly
moved them thereunto.

112. Thirdly, and lastly, the Fathers, when they condemned any Heretic, or
heretical Book, did it openly to the view of the World, and not secretly in a
corner, not ascribing unto them other opinions then they held, either by adding
unto, or detracting from their writings: But our Romish correctors, like Owls,
fly by moonshine, and so closely c^rtie their business, that they would have
none to discry them: yea, they deny and abjure this trade, I mean, in respect
of the Fathers, and in a word, they make almost all Authors to speak what
they list: for if any thing dislike them, deleatur, let it be wiped out, or at
least mutetur, let it be changed: or addatur, let something be added unto it,
that may change the sense, and turn the sentence into a new m^ld* of all these
their Iudices Expurgatorij afford plentiful examples: so that they can no
ways color their forgerie and false dealing by the examples of the Fathers,
or Primitive Church. For this is a new trick of legerdemaine of the Devils
own invention, found out in this latter age of the World, which has been
very fertile in strange devices.

113. Now then to conclude, and to leave this Priest with his vain and idle
reasons, to be fuller confuted of him whom it more nearly concerns, and
whose credit is touched by him: Hence two necessary conclusions do arise:
one, that they are guilty of forgerie and corrupting of Authors, by their
own confessions: and secondly, that they add hereunto impudency and
shamelessenesse, which is always the mark of an Heretic, and that first, in
defending their own unjust Frons Haereticorum, non est frons.
and false dealing by reasons, as if their wits were able to maintain that
snow was black, and the Crow white: and secondly, in translating the crime
from themselves unto us, without all show of reason, not caring what they say,
so they say something, for the honor of their mistress, the whore of Babylon,
and defense of her cause.

114. Now then, seeing it is manifest that they labor to Conclusion.
uphold their Religion, by these unjust, ungodly and deuillish practices, as
treason, cruelty, perjury, lying, slandering and forging, this conclusion
must needs be of necessary consequence; that therefore their Religion is not
the truth of God, nor their Church the true Church of God. It is the judgment
of their own learned Jesuits touching this last crime (that Posseuine.
we may convince them out of their own mouths) that forging of false
Treatises, corrupting of true, changing of Scriptures, and altering of men's
words contrary to their meaning, be certain notes of heresy: what can the
Church of Rome be then less then heretical, that not only does all this, but
now at length professes and maintains the doing thereof as lawful and
profitable?

MOTIVE XIII. That Religion, the doctrines whereof are more safe both in
respect Gods glory, man's salvation, and Christian charity, is to be
preferred before that which is not so safe, but dangerous: But the doctrine of
the Protestants Religion is more safe in all those respects, and of the Papists
more dangerous: ergo, that is to be preferred before this, and consequently
this to be rejected.
THe first proposition is so evident and clear, that our Mayor.
adversaries themselves will not deny it, neither can it by any good reason be
excepted against: for as it is in bodily physic, that medicine is always
preferred, which brings with it less danger to the life of the patient, and
if it miss curing, cannot kill: so is it in the spiritual physic of the
soul, which is Religion: that doctrine deserves best acceptance, which is
most safe, and least dangerous for the souls health. And as desperate
medicines, if they be applied by a skillful Physicion, argue a desperate case
in the patient, so desperate doctrines prove a desperate cause. Neither will
any wayfaring man, when two ways are offered unto him, the one whereof is full
of manifold perils, and the end doubtful, the other safe from dangers, and the
end certainly good, not choose rather the safer and certainer way, and leave
the other: so men like Pilgrims, traveling toward the heavenly Canaan, the
way of Popery on the one side, and of Protestancie on the other being se^
before them, if they be well in their wits, will choose rather that way, which
is both the safer in the passage, and the certainer in the end. There is no
doubt then in this first proposition, and therefore let us leave it thus naked
without further proof, and come to the second, and examine whether our
Religion, or the Romish is the safer, that all men may embrace that which by
evidence of demonstration shall appear to be so, and resuse the contrary: and
here notwithstanding all the former pregnant arguments, whereby the falsitie of
their Church and Religion is plainly discovered, we put our selves again upon
a lawful trial, and refer our cause to the judgment, not of twelve men,
but of the whole world; that if our evidence be good, we may obtain the day,
and the mouths of our adversaries may be stopped: if not, we may yield as
conquered, to be led in triumph by them to Rome, yea to the Popes own palace
to kiss his feet, and receive his mark on our foreheads.

2. That the Religion of the Church of Rome is not so safe Minor.
as ours, may appear by comparing our principal doctrines together: and first
to begin with the Sacrament. That the body of Christ is truly, really and
effectually present in the Eucharist, both they and we hold, grounding upon
that text of Scripture ( this is my body:) but concerning the manner of this
presence, the Romanists hold, that it is by transub stantiation: we by a
spiritual presence, which notwithstanding is true and real, both in relation
to the outward signs, and to the faith of the Receiver. Now, see the dangers
that arise from their doctrine, which are not incident to ours.

2. First, if there be not a corporal presence of Christ, and a real
Transubstantiation, as they suppose; then this doctrine leads to horrible and
gross Idolatry: for they must needs worship a piece of bread, in stead of
Christ. And this not only, if their doctrine be false, but being supposed to
be true, in case he that consecrateth, be not truly a Priest, or have not an
intention to consecrate, as oftentimes it falls Gum^ Angel. ^^^. Eucharist.
Bell. de Sacram^t. in Genesis cap. 27.
out: for in both these cases, by the grounds of their own. Religion, there is
no change of substances; and therefore, as much danger of Idolatry, as either
of a false Priest, or of a true Priests false intention. But in our doctrine
there is no such danger, and yet as true, real and powerful an existence of
Christ's body in the Sacrament, as with them, if not more: seeing the more
spiritual a thing is* the more powerful it is, according to the rules of
reason: for we are not in danger to worship a creature in stead of the
Creator: but we worship the Creator himself, even Jesus Christ our
Redeemer, who is there present after a spiritual manner, and that as
reverently, devoutly and sincerely, as they do a piece of bread.

3. Secondly, by this doctrine our adversaries incline to favor the
Capernaites, who had a conceit of a corporal and fleshly eating of Christ's
body* and give just cause to the Pagans Theoph. in Ioh. 6 Aug. in Psalm. 58.
Gratian de consecrat. part. 3. did. 2.
to slander Christian Religion, to be a bloody and cruel Religion. Whereupon
the Fathers, to cross the one, and stop the mouth of the other, taught, that
Christ's speech in the sixth of John, was to be understood spiritually, and not
carnally; and that it was a figure, and not a proper speech. But our doctrine
does give no such occasion, either to the Heretics on the one side, or to the
Pagans on the other, neither has it any consanguinitie with the Capernaites;
and yet we retain as certain and powerful a participation of our Saviors
body and blood as they do. I know, they think to escape from this rock, by
a distinction of visible and invisible eating: as if the Capernaites dreamed
that Christ would have his body to be eaten visibly, but they inuisibly, that
is (say they) spiritually: which indeed is no cuasion, for an invisible eating
is a true eating. As when a blind man eats, or a seeing man in the dark, and
cannot therefore be called a spiritual eating, but a corporal: neither does
this free them from approaching near to the Capernaites, though they somewhat
differ from them, nor from giving just cause of offense to the Heathen; from
both which our doctrine gives full and perfect security.

4. Thirdly, and lastly, their doctrine of transubstantiation does not only
countenance, but confirm the ancient heresies of the Marcionites, Valentinians
and Eutychians, that impugned the truth of Christ's humane nature, for they
taught that he had not a true, but a fantastical body; and what do our
adversaries but approve the same indeed, though they seem to detest it in
word? when they teach that his body is present in the Sacrament, not by
circumscription, nor determination, but by a spiritual and divine presence,
quomodo Bell. de Eucharist. lib. 3. cap. 4.
Deus est in loco, as God is in a place, which is as much as to say, that his
body is not a true body, but a spiritual body, that is, indeed a
fantastical body. Again, the bread which they say is the body, is not
bread in truth, but in show, after it is consecrated: for there is nothing of
bread, but the mere accidents without a substance, according to their doctrine;
and so it is in all reasonable construction no better then a fantastical
thing, seeming to the outward sense, to be that which in truth it is not. Why
may not those Heretics then reason from these doctrines thus? If Christ's body
be a spiritual body in the Eucharist, and the bread be fantastical bread,
then why might not his body be so also, when he was on the earth? But the
former is true by your doctrine, O ye Romanists, therefore why may not the
latter, which is our doctrine, be also true? But none of these Heretics can
have any such advantage from our doctrine, which teaches that Christ, in
respect of his humane nature, is resident in the heavens, circumscribed by
place, and that he is present in the Sacrament, by the efficacy of his
invisible, and powerful grace, after a spiritual manner, as Saint Augustine
speaks, and Aug. tract. 50. in Ioh. in v. 8. c. 12.
that both the bread remains bread after consecration, and the body of
Christ remains still a natural body, after the resurrection, retaining
still the former circumscription, as Theodoret Theodoret Dialog. 2. 105.
avouches: this takes away all advantage from Heretics, which their doctrine
does manifestly give unto them. For these causes Petrus de Alliaco the
Cardinal does confess, that from our doctrine no inconvenience does seem to
ensue: if it Pet de Alliaco 4 q. 6. act. 2 s. Occa. in centiloq. Theolog.
could be accorded with the Churches determination. And Occham, that it is
subject to less incommodities, and less repugnant to holy Scripture. Thus we
see, that in this first doctrine touching the Eucharist, there is more
security, and less danger in our doctrine and Religion, then in theirs.

5. I come to a second point, which is, touching the merits of works: whereby
the Romish Religion does cast men into three eminent dangers which by our
doctrine they are free from. First, of vain glory: for when a man is persuaded
that there is a merit of condignitie, in the work which he has wrought, how
can he choose but rejoice therein, and conceive a vainglorious opinion of his
own worthiness: as the proud Pharise did, when he bragged that he had fasted
and prayed, and paid his tithes? seeing it is impossible, but that the nature
of man which is inclinable unto vainglory, and self-love: if it have a
conceit of any selfe-worthinesse, should be puffed up with a certain inward
joy, and pride: and therefore Chrysostom takes it for wholesome counsel, to
say, that we be unprofitable servants, lest pride destroy our Chrysostom. in Luc.
17
good works.

6. Secondly, of obscuring and diminishing Gods glory and Christ's merits. For
where merit is, there mercy is excluded: and where something is ascribed to
man for the obtaining of salvation, there all is not ascribed unto Christ: and
although they color the black visage of this doctrine, with a fair tincture,
to wit, that all our merits are from Gods mercy and grace, and that our good
works are dyed in Christ's blood, and thence receive all their virtue, and
rigor: yet it is but a false pretense: false, because they acknowledge some
merits before grace, as those of congruitie, and such as issue from grace, yet
in part, to be of nature as well as of grace, as has been already discovered:
and a pretense, because, if they receive all their virtue from Gods grace and
Christ's blood, then they are not to be termed our merits, but Gods: neither can
be said to deserve any thing at Gods hand of a proper worthiness, as they
teach, they do, but of Gods grace and mere mercy, which they disclaim: a
false pretense then is this, and does not free them from this danger of
diminishing Gods glory: and this also is confessed by S. Augustine, who says,
that we live more sasely, if we attribute Aug. de bone perseuerant. c. 6.
all wholly to God, and dee not commit our selves partly to God, and partly to
our selves: this the Romanists do, they divide stakes betwixt God and man,
grace and nature, Christ and Adam.

7. Thirdly, of making the best uncertain of their salvation: for as they
teach, no man can be certain of his own righteousness, nor of the goodness
of his works, by reason of the manifold defects that cleave unto their best
deeds, and also in respect of the vnscrutable deceit of man's own heart, which
is hidden not only from the eyes of other men, but even from a man's own
self, and is known only unto God, as the Prophet Jeremy tells us, and
also in respect of the strict Ier. 17. 9.
rule of Gods justice, whereby they must be examined. For which cause, the
holy man Job says of himself (according Job. 9. 2^
as it is in the vulgar Latin translation) I was afraid of all my works. And
Saint Augustine says, and affirms the same; Aug. de peccat. me^ it. and
remis. lib. 2. cap. 10. Greg. moral. lib. 9. cap. 1.
That though Job was a righteous man, yet he himself was afraid of himself.
And Gregory speaks to like effect, when he says; That the holy man Job,
because he saw all the merit of our virtue to be faulty, if it be strictly
judged by him which judges within, says rightly, If I will contend with him,
I shall not be able to answer one for a thousand. Now, that which befell
righteous Job, how can it but be incident to all Gods children? So, that
though they talk of meritorious works in general, yet no man can be sure
that his works in particular are such: and therefore no man, be he never so
just, can be sure of his salvation. I speak not here of that certainty which
is by faith, which they deny, but that assurance which is by hope, which they
confess: for a man cannot possibly hope that he shall by saved by his works;
when as he cannot possibly know, whether his best works are such as deserve
the favor or disfavor of God. And if it is the property of all Gods children
by the example of Job to be afraid of their works, then how can they repose
any hope and confidence in them? now all this is so evident, that Bellarmine
himself is Bell. de Iustif. lib. 5. cap 7.
driven after his long disputes, and much ado in strengthening their doctrine
of inherent righteousness, and merit of works, to confess ingeniously, like
a good honest man, (being as it were sorry for all that he had said) that
because of the uncertainty of their own righteousness, and the peril of
vain glory, the safest way is, to repose our whole trust and confidence in
the only mercy and goodness of God. But this we teach men to do, that
flying from all vain confidence in their own merits, they may repose
themselves only on the mercy of GOD in Christ Jesus: and therefore ours is the
safest way.

8. And if ours be the most safe, then theirs is most dangerous, which also S.
Bernard in as plain terms affirms, when Bernard in Psalm. qui habitat.
he says: Periculosa habitatio illorum, qui in meritis sperant, perculosa quia
ruinosa: dangerous is the dwelling of those which trust in their own merit, it
is dangerous, because it is ruinous. Now, who that is wise, will not choose to
walk in the safest way, and refuse the dangerous? or to dwell in a strong and
safe house, which will keep out the wind and weather; and not be ouerblowne
with any tempest, rather then in a ruinous cottage, which every blast is able
to ouerturne?

9. The doctrine of Free will is of like nature: for is it not 3. Council. Trid.
ses. 6. cap. 3. Bell. de great. and li. arb. 5. l. 5. c. 29 Coster Enchirid. de
lib. arbitr.
dangerous (think you) to ascribe some power to man's own will for his
conversion? as the Church of Rome does, when it teaches, that it is in man's
free choice to accept, ^rr^iect Gods grace offered unto him: and so either to
be or not to be converted. And is it not a safer course to ascribe all to
grace; and nothing at all to will? and to say with our Savior Christ, that
without him we can do nothing: and with Saint Paul, That we Ioh. 15. 5.
have no sufficiency in our selves, to think a good thought, as of 2. Cor. 3.
5. Philip. 2. 13.
our selves. And again, That it is God which works in us both the will and
the deed of his good pleasure. In the one, God has all the glory of the
work: in the other, man is equalled with God, will with grace, yea preferred
before it, for they not only teach, that grace and will are like two men
carrying Bell. de great. and lib. arbi. li. 4. c. 15
one stone, neither of them adding any strength unto the other, and both free
when they will, to cast off the burden: but also, that Gods grace and working
depends upon man's will, not man's will upon Gods grace. For thus they are not
ashamed to say, even the best and most judicious amongst them. Licet in codem
Bell. ibid.
prorsus momento temporis, and naturae Deus and volunt as operari incipiant,
tamen Deus operetur, quia voluntas operatur, non contra:.i. Though the God of
nature, and* freewill, begin to work together, at the same instant: yet God
works, because the will works, not the will, because God. Now, is not this
not only to equal, but also to subject Gods grace to man's will, and to make
the creature more powerful then the Creator? For by this doctrine, if a man
himself be willing, and give admittance to grace, he may be saved; but if God
be never so willing to save us, if we our selves willnot entertain his saving
grace, all his labor is vain: and so man's will must needs be of greater power
and efficacy, then Gods grace: which how dangerous, yea impious a thing it is
to affirm, let all men judge. I am sure Saint Augustine was of another mind,
who says not as the Romanists, that it is left to our free Aug. de corrept.
and great. cap. 11. Idem de great. and lib. arbitr. ca. 17.
choice, either to use, or to refuse the grace of Christ, that stands at the
door of our heart, to be let in or thrust out as we list: but it is (says
he) by grace, not only that we can do what we will, but that we are willing
to do what we can, and again, He works in us to will without our selves,
but when we are willing, then he works together with us.

10. But yet, this is not all the danger which arises from this doctrine,
though even this is of sufficient fear; to terrisie any godly man from
embracing it: but there is more peril in it then so: the maine danger of it is
this, if it be not pure Pelagianisme, as it may well be thought, yet it
marches on the very edge of the bank, so that if the foot do but slip, it
is presently in the gulf of that heresy: for what did Pelagius hold, which
the Church of Rome, in this doctrine of freewill, does not either directly
maintain or approach nere unto? he extolled man's nature, as that a man without
the name of Christ might be saved by freewill: so do they: for Andradius
tells us from the Council of Trent, that Heathen Philosophers having no
knowledge of Christ, were Aug. denatur. and great. cap. 39. Idem Epist. 107.
Idem cont. Pelag. and Celestin. cap. 32. Andrad orthod. expli lib. 3. page 277.
justified only by the law of nature. He taught that it was in man's
free will, to give entertainment or repulse to Gods grace: so do they. He
affirmed that a man might prepare himself to grace by his own naturals,
without any special work of the spirit: so do they. He, to cloak all with
some colorable pretense, confessed, that notwithstanding all this, there was a
necessity of grace required to all good actions. For thus he said (as
witnesses Saint Augustine) We so praise Aug ibid.
nature, that we always add the help of the grace of God: so do they:
albeit they strive for the freedom of man's will: yet they dare not but speak
of grace, and grant unto it some office in a man's conversion, and therefore
labor to reconcile natures will, and Gods grace together: Which nevertheless
in fine they are never able to do, but are driven to confess, that it passes
the capacity and apprehension of man's wit and understanding. Howbeit, both
Pelagius and they understand Bell. de lib. arbit. lib. 4. cap. 15. Benius cap.
20. page 353. Aug. Epist. 100. Bell. de. great. and lib. arbi. l. 6. c. 15.
by this grace, nothing but a thing that is common both to the wicked, and the
godly. This to be the grace which Pelagius required, Saint Augustine
testifies, and no other to be that which our Romanists speak of, witness
Bellarmine, who affirms that the first grace of a sinners conversion, is but
only a persuading, which does not determine the will, but inclines it in
manner of a propounding, object. And Coster, Coster Enchrid. de lib. arbitr.
that calls it not grace dwelling in the soul, but only an outward
impulsion, or motion knocking at the door of the soul, and not opening the
door it self: as the Scripture says, that God opened Act. 16. 16.
the heart of Lydia, but persuading freewill to open: and so standing at the
Porters reuersion, and like a poor man waiting his leisure: much like unto the
attending of Henry the Emperor at the city gate, three cold winters days
barefoote, and barelegged, till it pleased the Pope to let him in. Thus humble
grace must attend, till pride will be pleased to open the door unto it. I will
not say, that in all this Papisme and Polagianisme are all one, but (that they
may see how loath we are to wrong them in the least circumsta^ce) this is too
too apparent that they incline by this doctrine very nigh to the borders of
it, and almost touch the skirts. Who then will not think it a dangerous
doctrine? And what mad man will voluntarily come to a person infected with
the pestilence, when he may well pass by him in further distance? or walk in
the very brinke of a sleep bank, where if he do but tread awry he falls
into the Sea: whereas he may walk safely further off, without any fear or
danger? our doctrine therefore touching freewill ascribing all unto God, and
nothing unto man, and submitting the will of man to the grace of God, has no
affinity but opposition and contrariety to Pelagius heresy, is therefore the
safer, and of every wiseman to be embraced, rather then theirs, which leads
us apparently into all these dangers.

11. Their doctrine of satisfactions is also a most perplexed 4.
and dangerous doctrine, and gives no security to the conscience of a
penitent sinner. For first, what safety is there in a man's own satisfactorie
works, when as all the actions and passions of a Christian (be he as
absolute and perfect a man as possibly may be) by reason of the manifold
defects and imperfections, which cleave unto his best works, are far short of
that which they should be, and utterly vnproportionably to Gods justice? and
this they themselves deny not: for the Rhemists grant, that every man (be he
never so just) yet Rhem. in Mat. 6. 1^.
because he lives not without venial sins, may truly, and ought to say this
Prayer, Forgive us our trespasses. But venial sins are sins, and stand in
need of pardon; and Gods justice requires such a satisfaction, as is in every
respect perfect: therefore our own works being tainted and stained with such
sins, cannot stand in proportion with it. Is it not a dangerous thing then to
trust to our own satisfactions: which by their own confession are subject to
venial sins? and is it not more safe to rely upon his satisfaction only
which is free from all stain of the least sin, and able to answer the
strist justice of God in every respect?

12. Secondly, the satisfaction which Christ has made, not only admits no
exception, but is of infinite merit and value, to answer the infinite justice
of God: but the satisfactions of a mortal man admit many exceptions, and are,
if they were perfect, of a finite and limitable nature: and therefore cannot
be proportioned to the infinite justice of God: whether is it more safe then
to trust to an infinite satisfaction, that is, without all exception, or to a
finite which may many ways be justly excepted against? I know, their cuasion
is, that indeed it does require an infinite virtue, to satisfy for the
everlasting punishment of sin: but the temporal punishment being limited,
may be satisfied for, by a temporal satisfaction: a mere collusion: for
first, if a temporal pain, or finite action, can merit and purchase an
everlasting reward, as they teach, why should not the same redeem from an
everlasting punishment? their confession in the one condemns their assertion
in the other: and because they deny that our merits of satisfaction can rel
ease from hell, they must also of necessity deny, or at least blush to avouch,
that our merits of purchase are of sufficient value to deserve heaven: hell and
heaven being as of equal distance from man, so of equal merit or demerit to
man. Secondly, satisfaction is not to be respected, to the quantity of the
temporal punishment inflicted, but to the justice of him that inflicteth it:
and so though the temporal punishment be equalled by the penance of a sinner:
yet the justice of God which is infinite, is not satisfied nor equalled, and
therefore the greatest penance cannot be termed a satisfaction to God: but
Christ's satisfaction being infinite, equalleth the justice of God. Who would
not then rather choose this, to rely upon for his salvation, then the other?
Thomas Aquinas seeing this, ascribes an infinity Aquin. supplem. q. 13. art.
1. ^d. 1
to humane satisfactions, in respect that they are informed by grace: but
therein he crosses both all his fellows and their doctrine it self: for if
they be infinite, then they must needs answer as well for the eternal
punishment as for the temporal, which they deny.

13. Thirdly, they themselves cannot agree about their satisfactions, as
whether they be by precept and commandments: Vide D. Morton Protestant
appeal l. 2. cap. 15.. 7. and Doctor (...)ite page 249. way to the true Church.
or only by counsel and perfection, and not commanded: whether the virtue of
satisfying be in the outward or inward act, or in both; whether they serve to
take away the temporal punishment only, or the gilt of the sins, or the
punishment of hell excepting the eternity: whether they be so necessary, that
there can be no absolution without them, or that a sinner may be absolved by
his contrition, and confession, without penal satisfaction: and lastly, whether
the least satisfaction be sufficient for the greatest temporal punishment; or
that a due proportion is to be observed. All these intricate questions are
exagitated in this doctrine: some holding one thing, some another, without any
just, and sure resolution: what a dangerous thing is it then to rely upon
these uncertainties, which they themselves are not able to bring into grounded
principles? how much safer is it to repose our selves wholly upon that blessed
satisfaction of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, in which neither Romanist
nor Protestant could ever find any ambiguitie or doubt; but that it is of
absolute necessity for man's salvation, of infinite efficacy to appease the
wrath of God, and of proportionable dignity to the justice of God?

14. Lastly, after they have with one hand stretched the worthiness of their
satisfactions to the highest strain: yet they pull them down again with the
other, and make them of no force: for let the satisfaction be what it will,
yet the Popes pardon can dissolve the bonds thereof: for it is a ruled case in
their Religion, that all satisfactorie punishment may be Suarez. ^om. 4. disp.
^0. sect. 3.
released by a pardon: and this pardon may be obtained by saying not only
over certain prayers, visiting certain Churches, worshipping certain
relickes, and kneeling to certain pictures, etc. but also by disbursing
certain money out of their purses, that may come to the Popes purse and
coffers. Behold now the greatest danger of this doctrine, thy satisfaction is
released and made no satisfaction, and it is released by him of whom thou may
justly doubt whether he has Gerson. 2. par. de Indulgent.
authority so to do, and whether he may err in doing it: and he does it de
facto, not examining whether thou be truly penitent or no: but whether thou
have paid thy penitential tax or no: and that which is worst of all, he so
grants it, that it is always reuocable, at his secret pleasure: so that
satisfaction is made no satisfaction, by the Popes pardon: the Popes pardon is
made no pardon, because it is bought with money; (thy money perish with thee,
that think this gift of Act. 8. 20.
the holy Ghost can be obtained with money:) and the money is cast away:
because the Pope may both err in his pardoning, and also revoke his pardon
when he list, without giving any notice of the cause unto the party: what
security can a Christian conscience find in these unsure principles? How much
safer a course is it to rely upon Christ's satisfaction only, which is a true
satisfaction indeed: not disanulled by any act either of God or man: not
pardoned but performed, not purchased by money, but by faith which is more
precious then 1. Pet. 17.
gold: and lastly, not reuocable by any power in heaven or in earth, but
standing firm as an everlasting foundation, for the salvation of the elect?

15. Touching Antichrist, whether side does more incline 5.
to take part with his Apostacy, and is in most danger to be inthralled to
his dominion, let any indifferent man judge: for whereas it is granted by all,
both Romanists and Protestants, yea, and Fathers also, that Antichrist should
be a Monarch clayming an universal jurisdiction throughout the whole World,
and should also challenge to himself an infallibility of judgment:
Protestants abhorring all such manner of subjection, and renouncing all such
power in any creature, cannot possibly fall into the Antichristian gulf. But
Papists Bell. de Romans Pontif lib. 1. c. 5.
professing the Pope to be the sole Monarch of the Church, and his judgment to
be of infallible truth in the defining of matters C^^^er de Pontif. Salmer. in
Epist. Paul. disp. 11. and 14.
of faith, must needs be in more danger to be in Antichrists Kingdom: we
cannot be slaves to Antichrist, because we admit no government like unto his in
the Church, nor any such peremptory power of not erring in the government. But
they professing a government and a power in that government, so agreeable to
the state of Antichrist, may suspect themselves to be fallen into that
Apostacy, as they are indeed over head and ears. Our religion then is more
secure in this respect: whereas theirs, by their own principles, has some
affinity and correspondence therewith: and Antichrist himself may be in their
Church, but cannot by any probable conjecture be in ours.

16 Again, for the Article of Invocation of Saints, the 6.
Romanists that hold the affirmative, are in many respects subject to many more
and greater dangers then the Protestants which hold the negative: for first, if
their doctrine be not true, they manifestly detract from the glory of the
Creator, and give the same unto his creatures. Whereas if our doctrine be
false, we only detract from the glory of the creatures, and give it unto the
Creator. Now, by how much it is a greater sin to do injury to the
Creator, then to the creature, by so much the more dangerous is their
doctrine, then ours: and as it is safer to ascribe that glory to God, which is
due to man, then to man that, that is due to God; so is there more safety in
our doctrine then in theirs.

17. Secondly, in respect of charity: if they err in this opinion, then do
they turn the holy Saints of God into abominable Idols, and so offer that
wrong unto them, which, they being jealous of Gods glory, of all things most
detest: as the examples of Paul and Barnabas, and of Peter, and the Act 14. 15.
Act 10. 26. Revel. 19. 10.
Angel declare: but if we err, we only being jealous that Gods glory may
not be communicated to any other, deprive them of a little worship, which we
think belongs unto God, and in the mean while esteem them as blessed
Saints, and honor them by praising God for them, imitating their godly
examples, and keeping an honorable remembrance of them in our Churches. Now in
charity, whether is a greater wrong to the Saints, to turn them into Idols,
that is, into devils, or for zeal of Gods glory, to take from them a little
of their due honor?

18. Thirdly, in respect of conscience: if they do sin in this, it is the
horrible and fearful sin of Idolatry, which being spiritual adultery,
causes a divorce between God and his Church: and is, if not in malignitie
above heresy, yet heresy in the highest degree: for it robs God, not only
of his glory, but of his essence, and lifts up another into his throne: but
our sin, if it be a sin, is at the highest, even in the reputation of
their slander, but heresy, and that in the lowest degree, consisting in matter
of circumstance touching the worship of the creature, and not in any
fundamental point of Religion, that concerns the Deity. Now, whether
conscience should be more afraid of this or of that, I think no man doubts
that has a conscience.

19. Fourthly, we are sure that we cannot invoke any but the true God: for
our Prayers are made unto the blessed Trinity, and to none other. But they are
in danger to pray unto false Saints in stead of true, yea, unto those that
either never were in rerum natura, or that are in hell: for the being of many
of their Saints, is grounded upon their Legends and humane Stories: Sum.
Rossel. ^rt. in canonizat.
which were subject to lying and erroneous deceit, and the sainting of many
that are inrowled in that Kale^der, depends upon the Popes canonization,
which they themselves cannot deny but is subject to error; in so much that
Caietane, a learned and Can. loc. li. 5 c. 5. Plati in Bonif 8. Cathar ad^ers.
noua dogmat. Caiet. p. 127.
famous Romanist, is reproved by Catharinus another of the same stamp, for
calling in question the pretended miracles for the Virgin Mary's conception,
saying, That if one Saint be doubted of, the rest also may be doubted of; and
therefore, that no man can invoke or worship them, without manifest peril of
Idolatry. Now many of their Saints may be justly doubted of, if not worthily
rejected (Saint Augustines saying being notorious) that many that are tormented
in hell with Bell. de Sanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. ^
the Devil, are worshipped by men in earth. Therefore their invocation must
needs be dangerous.

20. Lastly, that God hears our prayers, no man doubts: but how the Saints
hear them, whether by the declaration of Angels, or revelation of God, or in
the glass of the Trinity, they themselves are not able to determine; what
wise man now will rely his faith upon such uncertainties? and not choose
rather to make his prayers to God, who, we are assured, hears them, and
knows the heart, rather then to them of whose knowledge and presence we have
just cause to doubt.

21. The worship of Images and relickes does plunge the practisers thereof,
into many apparent dangers, which the refusers cannot fall into. As first in
show, at least they cannot but be judged breakers of the second Commandment,
which forbids the worship of any Image, of whatsoever is in heaven, earth or
Sea, that is, in the whole world: but they worship many and diverse Images, of
all sorts: therefore in show must needs be transgressors of the second
Commandment. Neither can they rid themselves from this crime, but by new
devised distinctions of latria and dulia, I doll and Image, the one being of
Heathen gods, the other of Christian Saints. And in a word, some of them are
driven to say, that this Commandment was no part of the moral Law, but a mere
ceremonial Vasques de aderat. lib. 2. disp. 4. cap. 4.
precept, pertaining only to the Jewish Church, as has been shown before:
upon what quicklands, and shelfes are they driven, that cannot clear
themselves from Idolatry, but by such desperate distinctions, which have no
foundation in the word of God? the Commandment prohibiteth all worship of any
Image, yea, of the Creator himself, and all his creatures: they come with
their niceties of distinctions, and would make us believe, that not all
worship, but that only which is called latria, is forbidden: nor all Images,
but the Idols of the Heathen; that is, of such things as never were: nor to all
people, but the Jews only. I am sure, we in show* at least, and (in very
deed,) in truth, do give more reverence to this Commandment: for plainly and
directly, without distinguishing, diminishing, altering, or any ways wringing
the precept, we condemn all worship of all Images, in all people whatsoever,
as impious and Idolatrous: so that we are in no dapger of transgressing this
Commandment, as they are, if their distinctions help them not out.

22. This danger is in respect of God, another follows in respect of
conscience. The Paynims worshipped stocks and stones, that is, dead and
liuelesse things, as both the Prophet Esaias, and the Prophet David do plainly
avouch. Now, do Esaias 44. Psalm. 115.
not the Romanists the like? for let it be granted, that their Images and
those of the Heathen differ essentially, and that in truth: our Romanists
worship not simply stocks and stones, but the things represented by them;
yet this cannot be denied, but that in outward appearance, their worship
has great resemblance to that of the Heathen. For when they fall down before
the cross, and say, All hail, O Cross, our only hope, etc. as it is in
their Mass Book, and, Thou only art worthy to bear the ransom of the
World: what do they, but at least in show worship a stock and a liuelesse
thing as the Paynims did? and when they say, they worship not the thing it
self, but the thing represented by the Image, (as in the Cross, Christ that
was crucified on the Cross,) what do they but excuse themselves by the same
reason which the Panims did? for Seneca says, that by Jupiter standing in the
Capitol, Senec. quest. nature. l. 2. c. 45.
with lightning in his hand, they understood the preserver and governor of all
things: and Peresius a learned Papist affirms, that few or none among the
Gentiles thought their Idols Peres^rad. part. 3. page 45.
to be Gods: yea, Saint Paul himself tells us, that the Altar at Athens was
dedicated to the same God that Paul preached, Acts 17. 23.
though unknown unto them. So that in the matter itself, and in the manner of
excuse, they are (without all doubt) cousen-Germanes to the Paynims: and if
they be not in the gulf of their Idolatry, yet they confine very near upon
the Coasts thereof: whereas we more wisely march aloof, and are afraid to
approach any whit near unto them. This I speak by way of supposition, if their
Image Worship be not the same with the Paynims: but if it be, (as it is
indeed, as has been proved before) then with the heedlessefish, they are
leaped out of the frying pan into the fire: they are not any longer in the
danger, but in the mischief it self: let them choose which of these they
will, one they must needs fall into.

23. Thirdly, if we respect charity, this doctrine is in danger to break the
cords thereof, by giving a double offense, one to their own silly ignorant
seduced people: for they not being able to distinguish of their school
distinctions, latria and dulia, proper and improper worship, nor to put a
difference betwixt the Image and the samplar, which it represents, and being
warranted to fall down before the Image, do ordinarily fall into Idolatrous
worship: which is so common and notorious a thing among the ruder sort, that
Polidore Virgil, Cassander, and Agrippa, all professed patrones of Poly l. Virg.
Invent. li. 6. ca. 13. Cassand. consult. art. 21. Agrip. de vanit. cap. 57.
Popish superstition do say, that it is an ordinary matter, A wonderful
superstition that is nourished by Images, and so apparent, that it cannot be
denied. Now if this were a scandal taken, and not given, they might in some
sort be excused: but it is eu^idently, not only occasioned, but caused, by
reason that both the doctrine is inuolued with so many intricate questions and
distinctions, that it is impossible for an ignorant person to discern thereof,
and also because the Image it self (as the Prophet Habacuck tells us) is a
teacher of lies. For which cause, as Polidore Virgil reports, the Fathers, of
all vices, Polyd. Virg. quo supra.
condemned the worship of Images, for fear of Idolatry; the most execrable
vice of all. The second offense is to the unconverted Jews, who are most
zealous in this point of the Law against Images, insomuch (as Josephus reports
of them) they Joseph. Antiquit. lib. 15. cap. 11.
did hate the very Images of men in their Heathenish Trophies, as being
forbidden them by God. Now it is well concluded by a judicious obseruer of the
Western Religions, (and S. EDW. S.
without doubt is a most true observation;) that there is no one thing, in
outward respects, that does engender in the Jews such a detestation of
Christian Religion, and keep them from being converted, as the worship of
Images in the Church of Rome; for they, and that by good reason, may thus
dispute, If this Religion of Christians were of God, then they would not oppose
themselves to the express Commandment of God in worshipping Images, which he
has so plainly forbidden: but they oppose themselves to Gods Commandment, and
worship Images; therefore their Religion cannot be of God. Hence it is, as the
former learned Relator does report, that at Rome, though all the Jews in the
City are constrained once a year to come to a Christian Church* and there
hear a Sermon, for their pretended conversion: yet when as a Friar, before the
beginning of his Sermon, holds up a Crucifix, and prays unto it, in their
open sight, they are more alienated from the Christian faith by this odious
spectacle, then all the reasons and arguments that he can use, are able to
persuade them to the same. Behold two dangerous and fearful scandals which
arise from this doctrine: one, to their own weak ones, of which our Savior
says, that it were better for a man, that a millstone were hanged about his
neck, and that he were thrown into the Sea, then that he should offend one
of them: the other, to the obstinate Jews, whose conversion shall be so
beneficial to the whole world, as that Saint Paul calls it life from the
dead. Now our Religion Romans 11. 15.
is far from giving any such offense to one or other, either in this, or any
other point thereof, if it be not utterly misconstrued and misconceiued.

24. Again, in their worship of Relickes, there is no security 8.
at all, both in fear of Idolatry, which may be well committed to them, if
they be true, in giving them a higher measure of adoration then they
themselves allow of, which is easio to be done by the ignorant multitude: and
also in fear of worshipping false relickes, in stead of true, whereof there is
no small number in the Church of Rome, as has bin already declared: and
lasty, in fear of neglecting the true members of Christ, by a too sumptuous
prodigality toward the bones of (I cannot tell what) dead men, or other
creatures, as is most usual in their Church, and that in great excess: in
which respects, it is without question a more safe course, that all such
Relickes were buried under the earth, with due honor of Christian sepulture,
then that they should thus endanger both godly piety and Christian charity.
And this is the conclusion of their Cassander, who says, that it is more safe,
rather honorably to bury those corruptible relickes, and to draw the World to
the worship of their spiritual relickes, which neither time can corrupt, nor
fraud counterfeit.

25. Again they hold and teach, that traditions are to be 9. Council. Trid.
Sess. 4. decret. do. Can. Canus loc. l. 3. c. 3
honored, with equal affection and devotion, as is due unto the old and new
Testament: and that there are many things belonging to the doctrine and faith
of Christianity, which are neither expressly nor obscurely contained in the
Scriptures. And therefore, by their own confession, they build many doctrines
of their Religion upon tradition only, without Scripture, and acknowledge,
that without tradition many of them would reele and totter. The Protestants
hold the contrary, and constantly affirm, that the Scripture is an
all-sufficient directorie, and a most absolute and perfect rule for faith and
manners: and therefore that we ought not to rely our faith upon any thing,
but Scripture alone. Now let us consider, and examine whether of these two
doctrines are more safe for a man to repose his soul upon. And that our
doctrine is so, may appear first by the nature of the question it self, which
is controuerted betwixt them and us: for the question is not, whether the
Scripture be the Word of God, or no: therein we shake hands, as an undoubted
truth: but whether traditions be the Word of God or no: the affirmative they
hold, we the negative, and that by great and strong grounds, which our
adversaries themselves cannot deny, but that they carry great show of reason
and probability. Now whether is the safer course, to rely our faith upon
those principles that are unquestionably Gods Word: or upon those that are
controuerted, disputed, and called in question? Any man that goes about to buy
a purchase, will sooner venture upon such a title which was never called in
question, nor can indeed be doubted of, then upon a broken, disputable, and
undecided title: he will look twice upon his penny, before he part with it,
in such a case, lest caveat emptor prove him to be of little discretion, and
teach him to repent when it is too late. This is the case of every Christian;
we are to buy the truth, and Pro. 23. 23.
not to sell it, as Solomon counsels. Now who will not, that has any grain
of wisdom in his heart, rather lay out his money, that is, his soul and
conscience (which as Augustine calls it, is numisma Dei, Godscoyne, because
his Image is imprinted Aug. in Psalm. 65.
therein) for the purchase of that truth, which is without all exception in the
holy Scriptures, then for that which is said to be in traditions, but mixed
with many doubts and ambiguities? It is a rule in Law, that abundans cautela
non nocet: a man cannot be too wary in making sure his title to any thing
whatsoever. How much more then should it prevail in cases of conscience, where
the damage is not of house and land, but of our souls, which to every man
ought to be more precious then the whole world? Here is an evident direction
for our choice, if we either love the truth, or our own souls which must live
by it.

26. Secondly, it may appear by the perpetual certainty of the holy
Scripture, and variable uncertainty of unwritten traditions: for the Scripture
was ever the same since it was Scripture, and so shall continue to the end of
the World, no man daring to alter or change it, to add thereto or detract
ought therfrom, for fear of the curse denounced against such presumption. But
Traditions are, and have been ever most variable and unconstant: some that
have been held for Apostolical traditions, being utterly abrogated and
abolished: as threefold immersion, or thrice dipping in baptism for
signification Canus loc. l. 3. c. 5 Maldon. in Ioh. 6 Durant. de ritib. lib. 3.
cap. 24.
of the Trinity: giving the Eucharist to infants, which was used 600. years
in the Church: standing in public Prayers at Easter and Pentecost, and such
like: and some altered and changed, as deferring Baptism until the feasts of
Idem l. 1. c. 19.
Easter and Pentecost, into baptizing upon any occasion; fasting upon
Wednesdayes and Saturdayes, into Wednesdayes and Fridayes; Binius tom. 1.
Council. fol. 247. Benius Schol. in lib. 7. constit. Clem. cap. 24.
and so many ancient constitutions dispensed withal by the pretended
Apostolical authority of the Church of Rome, as is confessed by them. And
that this is an uncontrollable truth, that one famous example of the contention
betwixt the East and West Churches, touching the observation of Easter, does
euince: for the one side pretended a tradition from Saint John and Saint
Philip: the other from Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Now if some traditions be
thus uncertain, subject to change, abrogating, dispensing, and abolishing, all
must needs be of the same nature: and if all be of that nature, then there
can be no security in conscience, to suspend our faith upon them: the safest
way therefore is, to rely upon Scripture alone; the fullness whereof
Tertullian adored, and of Tertul. contra Hermog. cap. 22. Hierom com. in tit.
cap. 1. Aug. cont. liter. Petil. l. 3. c. 6.
the authority whereof whatsoever was destitute, Jerome judged to be nothing
but vain babbling: and besides the which, whosoever teaches any doctrine of
faith, Saint Augustine pronounces anathema against him.

27. Thirdly, and lastly, by the infallible truth which shines in the
Scriptures, as the Sun in the firmament, wherein no error ever was found, no
spots or blemishes, as in the Moon of traditions: no deceit, nor misleading,
unless in sense perverted, as by Heretics to their own destruction: but many
traditions have been as erroneous and deceitful in themselves, so the causes
of much error in the Church: witness Papius, who (as Eusebius testifies)
broched many exorbitant Eusebius. li. 3. c. 33.
doctrines, under pretense of tradition from the Apostles, and drew many
Ecclesiastical Doctors moved by his antiquity (for he was Disciple to John)
into the error of the Chiliasts; and all the ancient Heretics almost: who
flying from the Scriptures, did shelter themselves under the pretext Weston de
triplic. ho^. offic. l. 3. c. 22.
either of philosophical principles, fained gospels, or forged traditions: and
hereof, many ancient traditions themselves give pregnant evidence, as those
alleged by Clemens Alexandrinus, Clem. Strom.
to wit, Justification by philosophy, Repentance after death, Preaching the
Gospel to the wicked in hell; which the Romanists themselves condemn: or that
of Cyprian, touching anointing to be used in Baptism, and mixing wine with
water, which Saint Augustine relected as erroneous: or that of Aug. cont.
Cresconium. Iraeneus contra haereses.
Iraeneus, who says, that it was a tradition, that Christ suffered at fifty
years of age; which is disallowed by all sound authority, and convinced of
error by the Scripture it self. Of this kind a number more might be
produced, if need required: but these are enough to infer the conclusion,
that traditions are not of that infallible truth as the holy Scripture is, but
rather subject to error and falsehood: and therefore it can be no part of
Christian wisdom, to repose our faith upon them; for it is to build upon a
sandy foundation, which will deceive the building, in time of need.

28. Auricular confession has as little security in the practice 10.
of it, as any of the former doctrines: for first it implies inpossibilitie of
performance, by requiring a perfect enumeration of all particular sins, both
secret, and open, and that upon danger of damnation, the absolution being
frustrate, if this condition be not observed. Now, because no man is able to
perform this, therefore no man's conscience can be assured of the remission of
his sins by that sacramental medicine: whereas on the contrary, he that
confesses his known sins to God, and forsakes them with a general
detestation of all other unknown, though many escape his Prou. 28. 13.
remembrance, yet by Gods promise is sure to find mercy: which is the doctrine
of the Protestants. This is possible and easy to be done. The other
impossible, and improbable: and that many learned of their side have
ingeniously confessed, as Cassander, Rhenanus, with diverse others. And albeit
Cassand. consult. art. 11. page 82. Rhenan. argum. in Tertul. de poenit.
Council. Trid. sess. 14. cap. 5. Suar. tom. 4. disp. 22.
the Fathers of the Trent Council in show seemed to qualify the matter with
this limitation, that other sins which do not come into the mind of the
party confessing, diligently thinking upon them, are understood as generally
included in his confession: yet the Jesuit Suarez confesses, that the Priest
cannot remit any one sin, except the penitent confess all that he ought to
confess: and Maldonate another Jesuit, that because Maldon. Sum. q. 10. art.
8. 3.
the Priest can remit no sins but such as he hears confessed, therefore he
that must remit all, must hear all. And it is plain, that whatsoever the
Council spoke, yet it meant no otherwise, by the reason which they give for
necessity of confession: which is, that the penitent may be judged whether he
has sinned or no: and if he have, in what kind, and degree, to the end that
proportionable penance may be joined to his offense: and therefore it is
required, that not only the act of sin, but all the circumstances be
discovered. (Who, Suar. tom. 4. disput. 22.. 1.
what, to what end, how, by what helps, where, when) which are the seven
circumstances attending upon every actio^. Now how can the Priest judge of the
nature, quality, and quantity of the sin, except he know it with all the
circumstances? and if he know it not, how can he enjoin a competent
satisfaction? And if no satisfaction be enjoined, then no remission either of
the sin, or at least releasement from the temporal punishment thereof can
be obtained. What a snare are men's consciences brought into by this intricate
doctrine? How much freer and securer a course is it to confess necessarily to
God alone, voluntarily to the Pastor, in cases of distress of conscience, and
want of instruction, and penally to the Church in public, for satisfaction not
of God, but of men, for some public offense committed? This is the doctrine of
Protestants; which as it is free from impossibility, so it is full of safety.

29. Secondly, their doctrine leaves the conscience in doubt, whether the
sin be truly pardoned or no, by the absolution of the Priest: for the Priest
being a man, is unable to search into the heart of a sinner: and so
consequently may err in the use of the key: for if the Confessor be an
Hypocrite, though he make a true relation of all his sins with all their
circumstances, and be therefore absolved by the Priest: yet it is certain,
that such an one is not absolved in Heaven, but stands liable to Gods
judgment: because there must be by their doctrine, as well contrition in heart,
as confession in the mouth, or else no pardon can follow: but a Priest cannot
^4 ^o^.
discern of the heart. Nay further, many, if not most of their Romish
shauelings, are unable to judge of the nature and quality of sin, much more of
the quantity and degrees thereof; and so consequently can neither impose a
just or proportionable satisfaction, without which no releasement; nor make the
party understand the ease he stands in: that he may take upon himself
voluntary penance: or if need be, purchase indulgence from the Pope. In all
which respects, it is danger to trust our souls upon such a slipperie
foundation: but he that confesses to God his sins, and expects pardon at
his hand only, is sure that he discerns the secrets of the heart, and that
he shuts, and no man opens, and opens, and Revel. 3. 7.
no man shuts: and therefore if he absolve, though all the World condemn,
he is on a sure ground: and if he condemn, though all the World acquit, he
is in a miserable case. In this doctrine there is no uncertainty, but strong
comfort to the penitent sinner, and terror of conscience to the obstinate and
unrepentant.

30. If they say, that the absolution of a Priest is certain, unless there
be a bar in him that confesses, because our Savior says, Whosoeuers
sins you remit, they are remitted, and whosoeuers sins ye retain, they
are retained. I answer, that first, de facto, the Priest may err, but God
cannot: Secondly, he cannot choose but err in absoluing, if the penitent do
err in confessing, which he is very likely to do: and thirdly, that when
God purposes to absolute a sinner, no barie can hinder the performance
thereof: yea, he infuseth grace into his soul, to hate his sin, and power
to forsake it. Is it not better then to trust unto God then to man, and safer
to confess our sins to him that has absolute power to pardon them, then to
a Priest whose pardon depends upon the uncertainty of a man's true confession?
These things be so clear, that no reasonable man can doubt of the truth of
them.

31. Lastly, confession to God has manifest and undeniable grounds in holy
Scripture; but auricular Romish confession to a Priest, is by the judgment of
their greatest Clerks, taken up only by a tradition of the Church, and not by
any authority of the old and new Testament: witness their Canon Law,
Panormitane, Peresius, Petrus Oxoniensis, Bonauenture, Canon de poenit.
Panormit. sup. 5. de poenit. Peers. de traa^^. part. 3. consid. 3. Cera^z in
Sixth. 4. Ouand. 4. d. 16. pro. 2. Rhen. Annot. ad Tertul. de poenit.
Medina, Rhenanus, Erasmus with many more: and though the new Jesuits, and
Rhemists avouch the contrary, yet they but therein cross their fellows, as
learned and wise, as themselves, and yet are not able to allege any one
direct proof of their opinion. Now is it not a safer practice to build upon
Scripture then tradition, that is, upon God then man? And to choose that kind of
confession which no man doubts to be warranted from God, rather then that,
which the Patrones thereof themselves are at variance from whom it comes? who
that has eyes, sees not which of these is rather to be chosen?

32. Touching Purgatory, it breeds diverse dangerous 11.
consequences, as to their holy Pope first, who takes upon him to have
plenarie power over all creatures, especially over the souls in Purgatory,
which the Canonists call peculium Papae, the Popes peculiar: for it proves him
either to be a lying Prophet, or a cruel Tyrant: if he have full power over
them, why does he let so many thousand poor souls lie frying there without
release? His suffering them to continue in that cruel torment, argues him
either to want power to relieve them, or mercy to put that power in execution:
both which are unbeseeming qualities for Christ's Vicar. If they reply against
this (as Antoninus does) and say, that in respect Anton. part. 3. tit. 22. cap.
5.. 6. and 7.
of his absolute Jurisdiction, he may absolve all that are in Purgatory: but
if we regard the orderly execution thereof, in that respect the Pope may not,
nor ought so to do: I say again, But why ought he not? if it be in his
power? is it for fear to fill Heaven too soon with Saints? but that would be
a great blessing, for then the consummation of all things would the sooner
come: or is it for fear lest the justice of God should be fully satisfied by a
proportionable punishment? But the Popes indulgence can help that, for he
has in his Treasurehouse such a surplussage of Saints merits, that can serve
to make good whatsoever is wanting in their behalf: and the Pope by their
doctrine has authority to dispense and dispose of these merits, at his
discretion. Or is it for fear lest purgatory should be emptied, and so he
should lose one part of his Kingdom? But our Savior contented himself with
heaven and earth to be under him and his dominion; and Saint Mat. 28. 19 Phil.
2. 10.
Paul attributes to his regiment things under earth, that is, in hell: and will
his Vicar needs have a larger dominion then his Master? But indeed this is the
true reason. For if he should make a goal delivery, out of this infernal
prison: then his chiefest sway were gone, yea, and his revenue too. It stands
upon him therefore not to be pleased to deliver any out of these pains,
unless he be well pleased for his pains: and if he be so, then the souls
shall fly out of that place to heaven in whole troops, as they say they did,
at the Prayer of a certain holy man, etc. In their leaden Legend this danger
Legenda.
lights upon the head of their head, the Pope, which, according to their
doctrine, can by no means be avoided: it were better then for him to forgo
his profit which arises by purgatory, then to undergo such foul discredit.

33. Another dangerous consequence arises hencefrom, to all the professors of
Religion in general: that is, a fearful presumption and security of sinning,
when they are persuaded, that after this life they may be released from the
pains of purgatory by the prayers, almesdeeds, Masses and other meritorious
works of the living: for who would be afraid to sin, or careful to make
his salvation sure in this life with fear and trembling, when he believes,
that by giving a sum of money at his death for Masses and dirges to be sung
for his soul, he shall be certainly delivered out of purgatory? This must
needs cast men into manifest presumption, if not of all sins, yet of venial
sins, and ordinary offenses, which are to be purged by that fire, as they
teach. Is not our doctrine more sound and safe, that informs us, that such as
die in their sins, sink down to the lowest Hell, as hopeless after death
to be relieved by anything that can be done for their sakes by the living?
does not this teach men betimes to be wise? and to finish up the work of
their salvation before the night come? and make their peace with God, whilst
they are here in the way of grace, not deluding their souls with a fond
expectation of other men's devotions? Sure it is, that the opinion of purgatory
and prayer for the dead, must of necessity nourish a presumption of venial
sins at the least, which our doctrine adiudgeth to hell, without repentance,
as well as any other: and because few are able to distinguish betwixt mortal
and venial sins, but judge them venial which are to Gods judgment mortal,
as their Jesuit Coster confesses, Coster Enchirid. de side special.
when he says, that that may seem a light offense unto man, which is heinous
in Gods sight: therefore it must needs also be in danger to breed a secret
presumption of mortal sins also. And so, whilst they have a blind conceit
of the suburbs, which is Purgatory, they cast themselves into the City it
self, which is hell.

34. Lastly, this may be demonstrated to the conscience of any, not prejudiced
with a blind zeal to the Romish Church by this reason: for that neither
Purgatory nor Prayer for the dead, can directly be proved out of Scripture, as
has bin proved before concerning Purgatory, and is apparent concerning prayer
for the dead; there being neither precept nor promise, nor direct example in
the whole volume of Gods Book for the same, as is confessed by their own
Bredenbachius: and Oslander li. Papa non Papae, c. 17.
besides having no sound foundation in the consent of ancient Fathers, as has
been also proved: but being founded upon vain apparitions, and strange
revelations of souls departed, which many of the Fathers were of opinion could
not be, as testifies Maldonate, one of their own Jesuits: for fear,
Maldon. com. in Luc. 16.
lest under that color we should be drawn to superstitions: and others
thought, that Devils did feign themselves to be the souls of dead men, as
witnesses Pererius another Jesuit: yea, and Perer de magia lib. 1. cap. 11.
Salmer com. in Romans ^. disp. 52.
some of their own Doctors have been persuaded, that all apparitions about
Churches, are either demoniacall or fantastical: whereas on the contrary,
our doctrine of two places is direct in Scripture, and was never denied by any
authority, either of old or new Divines: I mean possitiuely, that there is a
Heaven and a Hell: wherefore, this we may safely believe, and repose our
souls upon: but to entertain the belief of the former is as dangerous to the
conscience, as doubtful to the understanding: seeing he that doubtingly
undertakes any action, is condemned as a sinner, because he Romans 14. 23.
does it not in faith: Faiths object being Gods Word alone, and not the
uncertain conjectures of humane opinions, much less the vain apparitions of
dead ghosts.

35. Again, their doctrine of the absolute necessity of 12.
baptism, excluding thereby infants from Heaven, and confining them to a
Prison in the brimme of Hell, there to endure the everlasting punishment of
loss, is a dangerous doctrine, both in respect of piety toward God, and
charity toward our neighbor, and certainty to a man's conscience: and
consequently our doctrine that holds the contrary, is more safe, in all
those respects. For touching piety, it is a great imbasing to Gods mercy, and
a detracting from the glory of his grace, to think that Almighty God should
in justice cast away the infinite myriades of unbaptized infants, or that his
saving grace is so tied to the outward Sacrament, that he cannot, or at the
least, will not save any without it: the first of these is confessed by many of
the learned Romanists Caiet. in 3. Thom. q. 68. art. 1. and 2. Biel in 4. Sent.
did. 4 q. 2. Gerson part. 2. p. 303. Bell. de baptis. lib. 1. cap. 4.
themselves, to be, a Dei misericordia alienum, not agreeable to the mercy of
God, which exceeds not only the deserts, but even the hopes of men. The
second is confirmed, by a due comparing of the old covenant of the Law, with
the new covenant of the Gospel: for if it be true, that children dying under
the Law uncircumcised, were saved by the faith of their Parents (as Saint
Bernard thinks) yea, and is also Bern. Epist. 77. ad. Hug^n. de S. Vict.
agreeable to the tenure of the Scripture: for many children dyed in the
Wilderness without the Sacrament of Circumcision: it being omitted for those
forty years by Gods own allowance: and David hearing of the death of his
child, before he had received the outward character of Circumcision, as may
be gathered out of the Text. did solace himself with 2. Sam. 12.
this confidence, that the child was saved. Then it must needs follow, if the
same privilege be not granted to the children of Christian Parents, that the
covenant of the Gospel is not so large, as the covenant of the Law: nor Gods
mercy so bountiful to Christians, as to Jews; nor the merits of Christ so
effectual after his coming in the flesh, as they were before: by all which
the glory of the Gospel and grace of Christ is much defaced, and the
unbounded Ocean of Gods mercy limited and stinted.

36. Touching charity, is it not an uncharitable conceit, to despair of the
salvation of poor infants dying without Baptism? and that, both toward the
infants themselves, who though they are borne in original sin, yet are
innocent from actual transgressions: and toward the Parents, who being
themselves within the covenant, hereby are deprived of that chief comfort of
the covenant, which is, that God is not only their God, but the God of their
seed: and toward the Church, that hereby is robbed of a great part of her
children, and made unable to present young infants to her Husband Christ Jesus.
Children are little beholding to them for this doctrine, Parents less, and the
Church, the mother of the faithful least of all. And indeed so far is it
from charity, that it is full of damnable cruelty.

37. Lastly, touching the perilous consequences that follow upon this doctrine,
I need name but these three, to wit, first, that it makes God more merciful
to men of years, then unto tender infants: for they teach, that men of years
(as Valentinian the Emperor) may be saved, by the Baptism of the Spirit, or
by the Baptism of blood, which is Martyrdom, though they want the Baptism of
water: but infants, albeit they may have the Spirit of sanctification, even in
the womb, as John Baptist had, and may be Martyrs according to Bell de baptis.
l. 1 cap 6. Mat. 2.
their opinion, as the children that Herod caused to be slain, yet if they
want the Sacrament of water, they adiudge them peremptorily to be banished from
Gods presence for ever. Now then children and men being in the same
predicament: either the one must be admitted to Gods favor as well as the
other, or it must needs follow, that God is partial and more favorable to the
one then the other. If they say that men, though they have not the act of
Baptism, yet they have votum, a desire unto it, which being intercepted by
some sudden accident, is supplied by inward grace: I answer with Bellarmine,
that Bell. de baptis. l. 1 cap. 9.
as another man's sin was the cause of the damnation of infants, so other men's
faith suffices them unto baptism. Why should then the desire of one man be of
more efficacy to his salvation, then the desire and purpose of the Church for
the salvation of infants? To this purpose their own learned Schooleman Aquin.
3. part. q. 68. and 69.
says, that the child before it be baptized, is in some sort partaker of the
Sacrament of Baptism, even by the faith of the Church, which has vowed him
thereunto. And Bonauenture, as Cassand. de baptis. Infant. fol. 148. par.
altera.
he is reported by Cassander, says, that infants are disposed unto Baptism,
not according to any act of their own, but according to the act of other:
because the mercy of God imputes to them as their own will, the will of
another. Insants therefore stand still in as good case in every respect, as men
of years, if not in better, both being unbaptized, and the one dedicated to
God by their own desire, the other by the purpose and desire of the Church:
and therefore, either these may be saved as well as they, or else God is not so
merciful to them, as to these: which is no less then impiety to think, and
blasphemy to pronounce.

38. Another wicked consequence that follows upon this doctrine, is, that it
makes God the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, even that blessed
Trinity, that is the fountain of all truth and goodness, to be liars and
teachers of untruth. For God the Father says to Abraham, I will be Genesis 17. 7.
thy God, and the God of thy seed. And that this is not to be understood of
the seed of Abraham according to the flesh only, to wit, the Jews, but much
more of his seed according to the Spirit, which are faithful Christians, may
appear both by that which is in the very same place, where it is called Gal
3. 14.
an everlasting covenant, and by Saint Paul's testimony, who affirms that the
blessing of Abraham was to come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, as well as
on the Jews. God the Son says, Suffer little children to come unto me, for
of such Mat 19. 14.
is the Kingdom of Heaven: plainly affirming that the Kingdom of Heaven is
pertaining to little children, and not barred up against any, as our Romanists
teach it is, against such little ones as dye without baptism. Our Savior
says without exception, that the Kingdom of Heaven belongs unto them: they,
as it were to make him a liar, bring in an exception and say, that except they
be baptized, not Heaven, but Lymbus belongs unto them. And the holy Ghost by
the mouth of Saint Paul says, That the children of believing 1. Cor. 7. 14.
Parents are holy: the reason is, because the root is holy, and therefore the
branch must needs be holy: and if children may be holy before they be baptized
then by the same rule they may go to Heaven before they be baptized: for as no
man without holiness can see God: so with holiness none can be banished out
of the sight of God. And thus this doctrine gives the lie to every person of
the blessed Trinity.

39. If they say, that it is our Saviors doctrine, that except a man be borne
again of water and the holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven, and therefore, all those general promises are to be restrained by
this exception (if they be baptized:) I answer out of Bellarmine, that God is
not tied to his Sacraments, but can save them by Bell de Christo lib. 4 cap.
vlt. Cassa^d. de baptisanfant. par altera fol. 128. 134.
his especial grace: as also witness diverse others of their learned Doctors.
And therefore, whereas our Savior says, Except a man be borne again, etc. it
must needs be understood by another exception, to wit, of cases of necessity,
where Baptism cannot be obtained, and is not contemned: for not the want, but
the contempt of Baptism is damnable.

40. The third and last inconvenience that arises from this doctrine, is, that
it is the mother of diverse strange paradoxes and gross absurdities, as not
only of Lay men's Baptism, yea, of Pagans, and that in scorn, but also of
changing the true element into lee, or broth, or puddle water, and that which
is most strange, of baptizing the child in the mothers womb before it be
borne, or ripping up the mothers belly, in case the child be in danger of
death, etc. some of all which absurdities are held by them all, and all by
some. Is it not then more safe to hold that opinion which is more respective to
Gods glory, agreeable to Christian charity, and free from all these dangerous
consequences?

41. To conclude, omitting many other of their doctrines, 13.
which might easily be shown to stand in the same case of dangerous tenure,
and has in part already been manifested; as their doctrine of set fasts,
implicit faith, venial sins, dispensations with others more: I propound for
the last instance, that doctrine of doctrines, the very groundcell of their
ruinous Religion, touching the verity, authority and singularity of their
Church, which they vaunt and brag to be the only true Catholic Church of
Christ, and to have a preeminence over the Scriptures, and without the which to
be no possibility of salvation: that there is no safety in these positions
many reasons will euince, as first, if it should be true, that out of the
bounds of that Church, none could be saved then those famous Churches of Asia,
which were in Pope Victors time, that opposed themselves against the
predominance of the Church of Rome, were all damned, wherein flourished many
holy Martyrs that gave up their lives for the testimony of Jesus. Then Saint
Cyprian and all the Bishops of Carthage, to the number of fourscore, that in a
Council at Carthage set themselves against Pope Stephen and his Council, were
damned: and Saint Cyprian must be no longer a Martyr but a Schismaticke; and
then S. Augustine with the whole Church of Africa and troops of Martyrs and
Confessors should not be crowned with bliss, but tormented in hell, for they
rejected the yoke of the Bishop of Romes authority, and would not admit that
any should make appeals from them to Rome. This horrible and uncharitable
inconvenience does arise from that dismal doctrine, The Church of Rome is the
only Catholic Church, and out of it there is no hope of salvation: now that
these holy and heavenly Martyrs and Confessors of Jesus Christ were out of it,
appears by their most received definitions, of a Catholic and a
Schismaticke: A Catholic (faith Bellarmine) is Bell. de Eccles. milit. lib. 3.
ca. 2.
he, that is subject to the one Pastor the Pope, whereby he mak^th the
essential form of a Catholic, to be his union and conjunction Tollet.
instruct. Sacerdot. l. 1. ca. 19.
with his head the Pope: and a Schismatike (says Tollet.) is he that does
separate himself from the head of the Church and the Vicar of Christ. I assume
but Cyprian, Augustine, and those other famous Bishops did not acknowledge any
subjection to the Pope, but separated themselves from his dominion; therefore
they were by their doctrine no Catholics but Schismatickes, and consequently
out of the Church, and so out of salvation: a damnable conclusion.

42. Secondly, they peremptorily avouch, that none of us being not members of
their Church, can be saved: we on the contrary charitably believe, that many
of them that are ignorantly members of their Church, if they hold the
foundation of Jesus Christ, and depend upon his merits, not their own, so that
their ignorance be simple and unaffected, may be saved. And hereupon they
conclude, that it is safer to be of that Church, wherein by our own
confession, a man may be saved: then of that to which they deny all hope of
salvation: but it is a conclusion made by confusion. For who sees not, that
that is more likely to be the true Church, which is animated with charity,
then that which is void of charity? and that it is safer to harbor under her
wings, that is charitably affected even toward her enemies, then under her,
that is so miscarried with envy, that she commits all to the pit of Hell,
that are not of her fellowship and profession: especially, seeing Saint Paul
charge the Thessalonians, that If 2. These. 3. 14.
any man obey not the Gospel, they should note him with a letter and have no
company with him, that he may be ashamed, yet 2. These. 3. 14. 15
they should not accout him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother? If
then it be safer to think charitably of those that are without, then utterly
to condemn them all: then it must be also safer to be a member of our Church
then of theirs. And to make the matter more clear, Saint Augustine is flat of
Aug. init. Epist. 162 Glorio. and ^lensio, etc.
our mind; to think more Christianlike of Heretics (as they repute us) then
they do: for writing against the Donatists, thus he says, They that defend
their false doctrine without obstinate boldness, especially, if they be not
such as have been authors of those errors, but either received them from
their Parents, or were seduced by others, and do carefully seek the truth,
being ready to be reformed, as soon as they shall see their errors: such men
are not to be esteemed as Heretics. Thus writes Saint Augustine, whereby he
condemns the practice of the Church of Rome, and justifies ours as more
agreeable to the rule of charity: and thus, that reason whereby the Jesuits
seduce many ignorant persons, falls to the ground, and makes more against
them, then for them.

43. Thirdly, if the Churches authority be above the authority of the
Scriptures, then are men to be preferred before God, and that which is subject
to error, before that which can neither err nor deceive: for the Church
consists of men: but the Scripture is immediately from God, and the Church may
err, though not in fundamental points: but the Scripture cannot err, no not
in the least titte: the truth of this allegation is grounded upon those
reasons. First, because every particular Church may err, as is confessed, and
therefore the whole Chuchin general may err also: for such as is the nature
of the parts, is the nature also of the whole. Secondly, Councels, which are
their Church representative, have erred, as is notoriously known to all, and
confessed by Saint Augustine, who says, that the decrees of provincial Aug.
de baptis. cont. Donatist. lib. 2 cap. 3.
Councels are subject to reprehension. Yea, former general Councels may be
corrected by them that follow, as the Council of Arimine, by the Council of
Constantinople, the second of Ephesus, by the Council of Chalcedon: the
Council of Carthage, by the first of Nice, and the second of Nice, by the
Council of Franckeford. Thirdly, the Pope, that is, the Head of the Church,
has erred; this is also confessed, therefore the body can claim no better
privilege: but says the same Augustine, There is no doubt of the truth of any
thing Idem ibid.
which is contained in the Scripture. Therefore, who can doubt to place the
resolution of their faith, as the safest course on the Scripture, rather then
on the Church; especially, seeing no particular writer of the holy Scripture
can be taxed with the least error but many particular parts of the Church,
whether we respect the imagined head, which is vertually the whole Church, in
their estimation, or the chief members in gross, as the Councels, or the
divided joints, as particular Congregations, may justly be challenged, as
tainted with diverse errors in doctrines of faith.

44. Lastly, the Church of Rome may be the whore of Babylon, and so the Sea of
Antichrist, if not necessarily as we avouch, yet coniecturally as no man can
deny; because spiritual Babylon is said to be a City situate upon seven
hills, and not only so, but that reigned over the Kings of the earth; both
which notes directly agree to the City of Rome: but the Church of Protestants
cannot by any likelihood be that whore, seeing neither of those marks do in
any respect belong unto it. Is it not safer then, to rest our selves in her
bosom, which by all probability is an honest Matrone, then in her arms, which
is a suspected harlot? If Caesar would have his wife to be without suspicion,
then every Christian had need to look to his faith, whereunto he is as it
were married by the Spirit of God, and whereby he is married unto Christ, that
it be not only sincere, but also free from all suspicion or likelihood of
error.

45. Thus we see, in these few maine points of the Romish Religion, compared
with our contrary assertions, that it is a far safer course, to be a
Protestant, then a Papist: let all indifferent persons judge and discern
betwixt us: and I pray God direct them by his Spirit to choose the truth.

46. There is one thing yet remaining, whereby this may 14.
further appear, and so and end of this whole discourse: and that is, that
there is no one point of doctrine wherein they differ from us, but is
contradicted by some of their own learned Writers shaking hands with us, and
crossing their own Pew-fellowes: whence from, arises not only another strong
argument of greater security in our Religion then in theirs, which has the
suffrages of the greatest enemies to uphold it, but also of irresistable truth,
which works so upon the consciences of the adversaries thereof, that it
forces them, will they, nill they, to acknowledge it, now and then, as the
Devil himself was constrained to confess Christ Jesus to be the Son of
God. I might write a whole Volume of this point alone: but I will propound here
only some few instances, and so shut up this Treatise.

47. Protestants teach that a man is justified by faith alone, 1.
whereby the righteousness of Christ is imputed unto him: and not by the
inherent or adherent righteousness of his own works: the same is confessed
by Thomas Aquinas, Aquin. in Gal. 3. lect. 4. and in Rom 3. lect. 4. and in 1.
Tim. 1. lect. 3. Pighius cont. Rat. spon. cont. 3. page 47.
who says, that no man is justified with God by his works, but by the habit
of faith infused: and again, that there is in the works of the Law, no hope
of justification, but by faith only: and by Pighius, who holds, that there
is in us no inherent righteousness whereby we may be justified, but that our
justification is by Christ's righteousness imputed unto us: and by the Divines
of Collen, who affirm, That the righteousness of Antididag. C^l^. page 29.
Christ imputed unto us, and apprehended by faith, is the principal cause of
our justification: and by Cassander, who approves Cassander consul. art. 4. de
Iustif.
of our doctrine of justification by faith alone, and imputed righteousness,
So that we exclude not from this faith, repentance, amendment of life, new
obedience, etc. Lastly, by Ferus Stapulensis, Peraldus, and diverse others, yea,
almost all of them, when at the point of death they come to the point of try
all, fly to this sacred anchor of Christ's righteousness alone, renouncing all
righteousness in themselves, as the famous example of Stephen Gardener
declares, who lying on his deathbed, reposed himself on the righteousness
of Christ only, for his salvation: and being told, that it was contrary to his
former resolution, answered, that though it was the truth, yet that gappe was
not to be opened to the people.

48. The Protestants hold, that our best works are stained 2.
with so many imperfections, that they cannot merit any thing at Gods hand,
except it be hell fire and damnation; and that though God of his mercy reward
good works with eternal life, yet it is not for any condignity that is in
them, but for Christ's sake, into whom the party working is ingrafted and made
a member. Many learned Romanists are of the same opinion: Bellarmine says,
that in regard of the uncertainty Bell. de Iustif. lib. 5. cap. 7. Walden. tom.
3. de sacram. c. 7. Bell. de Iustif. lib. 2 cap. 2. Ferus in Mat. cap. 20.
verse. 1. Greg. A imine^s. p. 1. d. 17. q. 1. art. 2. p. 89. Durand. q. 2. did.
27. p. 200.
of our own righteousness, and danger of vain glory, the safest way is, to
put our confidence in the sole mercy and goodness of God. Waldensis writes,
He is a sounder Divine, a faithfuller Catholic, and more agreeing to the
Scriptures, that simply denies merits, and says that the Kingdom of Heaven
is from the mere grace and will of the giver; not from any desert of the
Receiver. Of the same opinion was Albertus Pighius, as witnesses Bellarmine.
Ferus says, Whatsoever God gives us, is of grace, not of debt. If therefore
thou desire to hold the grace and favor of God, make no mention of thy merits.
The same hold Gregorius Ariminensis, Durandus, Stella in Luc. c. 7
Stella, with many more, renouncing all the new Rhemish doctrine of merits of
condignitie, taught by the School, and fourbished over by the Council of
Trent, and refining Jesuits. All these being sworn subjects to the Church of
Rome, yet being constrained by the conscience of the truth, do as fully and
perfectly maintain our doctrine, as if they were the rankest Protestants in
the World.

49. Protestants deny all free will to grace, before it be 3.
quickened and lived by Gods Spirit. Many learned Romanists teach the same
doctrine. Laurentius Valla (as Bellarmine Bell. de great. and lib. arbit. l. 4.
c. 5. Lumbard. lib. 2. did. 25.
reports) wished that the name of free will were utterly taken away. The Master
of Sentences avouched, that free will, before grace repair it, is pressed and
overcome with concupiscence, and has weakness in evil, but no grace in good;
and therefore cannot but Dom. Bannes 2. q. 24.
sin damnably. Dom. Bannes affirms, that it is false, and worse then false,
that any man, without the special and supernatural help of God, can be able
to do a supernatural act. Ariminensis Ariminens. 2. d. 29. art. 2. Suarez de
auxil. great. lib. 3. c. 20.
calls the Romish doctrine of free will, Pelagianisme. The Jesuit Suarez
says, that diverse Romanists say, that it is a rash and heretical opinion to
affirm, that when grace is equally offered to two, that one of them could be
converted, and not the other. What could any Protestant say more?

50. Transubstantiation, circumgestation, and subtraction 4.
of the Cup, are denied by many of their own side, as well as by us. Durand
says, It is great rashness to think, the Durand. 4. d. 11. q. 1.
body of Christ, by his divine power, cannot be in the Sacrament, unless the
bread be converted into it: and therefore that he holds the contrary, only
for the Churches determination. So also says Scotus, There is no Scripture to
enforce Transubstantiation, Scot. 4. d. 11. q. 3 Occam. in Ce^tiloq. theolog.
except ye bring the Church of Romes exposition. Occham says, that that
opinion, that the substance of the bread remains, is subject to less
inconveniences, and less repugnant to reason and holy Scripture. The custom
of circumgestation of the host (says Cassander) may Cassand. consult. art. 22.
be left with greater profit to the Church, if it be wisely laid down: both
because it is but a new invention, as also, because it seruethrather for
pompous ostentation, then for any godly devotion: and so (as Albertus Crantzius
says) is contrary to Christ's institution. Pope Gelasius (witness Gregory of
Valintia) Greg. de Valent. lib. 2. de Idolat. cap. 5. Cassand. consult. art. 22.
said, that the substance of the bread and wine in the Eucharist do not lose
their nature. Touching abstraction of the Cup, their learned Cassander
acknowledges, that for the space of a thousand years after Christ, the people
communicated in both kinds: and that in Greece and Armenia they do still: and
the best Catholics earnestly desire a reformation of this matter in the
Church of Rome. And Durand their Schooleman, Durand. Ration. l. 4. c. 55.
that the receiving in one kind only, is not a full sacrament all receiving:
for though that in the consecrated host Christ's blood be contained, yet it is
not there sacramentally, in that the bread signifies the body, and not the
blood: and the wine the blood, and not the body. Of the same mind were
Alexander Albert, mag. in 4. Sent. did. 8. art. 13. Alex. Alens. q. 5^ Biel in
can. tect 52.
Alensis, Albertus magnus, Biel, with others more: this last affirming, that in
the Apostles times all did receive the wine as well as the bread, because God is
no respecter of persons. The second, that it is of greater use and profit to
the faithful: and the first, that it is a matter of greater merit. Thus all
these Schoolmen 5. Panor. super 5. de poenit. and remiss cap. omnes. Peers. de
tradit, part. 3 consid. 3. Ouand. 4. did. 16 pro. 2. Refert. Henric. Sum. p.

poenit. Acosta lib. 6. de procurand. Ind^r sal. c. 16.
do protestantize in this point.

51. Auricular confession is denied by Protestants, to be necessary for the
remission of sins, and to be commanded by God. The same is auerred by
Panormitane, Peresius, Bonauenture, Medina, Rhenanus, Erasmus, Caietane, etc.
all of them concluding with one voice, that it is a doctrine derived only from
a positive Law of the Church, and not from the Law of God; yea, and the last
that is named (to wit Cardinal Caietane) is bold to say, that it is so far
from being commanded, that every one should be shriuen, before he come to the
Communion; that the contrary is insinuated by the Apostle, where he says,
Let a mantry himself: And Gratian confesses; that Ambrose, Augustine,
Chrysostom, Theophilact, and other Greek Fathers thought, that secret
confession was not necessary. And lastly, Acosta, a famous Jesuit, avouches,
that it would be well for the Indians, if the bond of confession might be
taken away, lest they should be constrained to commit so many and so grievous
sacriledges.

52. So the Romish doctrine of satisfactions is utterly condemned 6.
by Protestants; and not only by them, but by many of their own learned
Doctors: for the Divines of Louaine (as Bellarmine witnesses of them) and
others, did certainly Bell. de Indulg. lib. 1. cap. 4.
defend, that the sufferings of Saints cannot be true satisfactions, but that
our punishments are remitted only by the personal satisfaction of Christ. And
Panormitane says, that a man may be inwardly so penitent and contrite, that he
shall need no satisfaction at all, but may be absolved presently without any
penance doing. And another, that the treasure of Indulgences Vide Mortons Apol.
lib. 2. cap. 12. p. 398.
does consist only of the merits of Christ, and not of the satisfactions of
Saints, because the merits of Christ are of infinite value.

53. Protestants condemn the worship of Images, taught 7.
and practiced in the Church of Rome, but they are not alone therein: but have
many Romanists for their abetters and companions. Cassander concludes out of
Saint Augustine, Cassand. consult.
that there were no Images in all the Churches of his Diocese. And Polydore
Virgil writes, that by the testimony of Jerome Polyd. Virgil de Invent. l. 6.
c. 13.
it appears, how in a manner all the ancient Fathers condemned the worship of
Images for fear of Idolatry: thus speaks he in his uncorrupted editions,
but in his later editions, his tongue is tied by the Belgicke Index: others, as
Holcot, Durand, Index Belgic. in Polyd. Virgil. Holcot lec. 157. in Sapient.
Durand. 3. d. 9. q. 2. Alphons. haeres. verb. adorat. Sixth. Senen. bibl. lib. 3
annot. 247. Abbas Vrsperg. anno 793. Rhegino an. 794 page 30. Council. Mogunt.
anno 1549. sub Sebast. c. 41. and 42.
Alphonsus, flatly affirm, that no worship at all is due to an Image, neither
is it lawful to worship it: diverse Councels also decreed the same, as the
ancient Council of Eliberis propounded this only remedy against Idolatry,
that no Images should be painted in Churches: but this Council was not
Romish, for Popery was then scarce in the Embrio: therefore of later time a
mere Romish Council, to wit, that of Franckford, consisting of many Romish
Bishops and the Popes own Legates, condemned all worship of Images: and a
later yet, to wit, the Council of Mentz, held in the year 1549. decreed, that
the Image it self was not to be worshipped: but that by the Image of Christ,
men should be stirred up to adore Christ: which is contrary to the new
professed doctrine of the Church of Rome.

54. Many Romanists, as well as Protestants, reject the intercession and
invocation of Saints, as an Article not found either in the old or new
Testament. In the old Testament (says Salmeron) The Patriarchs used not to be
inuocated, both Salmer com. in ^om. 2. disp. 8.
because they were not in perfect estate of blessedness, and also, because
there had been then a danger of Idolatry, to offer that honor unto them. And
for the new Testament, the same Jesuit confesses, that this article is not
expressed, because the I^^ ibid. disp. 1.
Jews would have thought it an hard matter to invoke Saints departed, and
the Gentiles would have taken occasion to have thought, that the worship of new
Gods had been prescribed unto them. Of the same opinion was Ecchius, who
peremptorily Ecchius Enchir. Faber Stapul. praef. in Euang.
affirms, that the invocation of Saints departed, is not commanded in the
holy Scripture. And Faber Stapulensis thus writes, I would to God, that the
form of believing might be fetched from the Primitive Church, which
consecrated so many Martyrs to Christ, and had no scope but Christ, nor
employed any worship to any, save to the one Trinity alone.

55. That a Christian may be certain of his own standing 9.
in present grace, and of his future salvation, is the doctrine of Protestants,
denied by the Church of Rome, and yet approved by many of her dear children:
as for example: Every one that believes, sees that he does believe (says
Dominicus Dom. Bannes in T^om. 2. 2. p. 359.
Bannes) A Christian man, by the infallible certainty of faith which cannot
be deceived, certainly knows himself to have a supernatural faith (says
Medina.) Some spiritual Medina 1. 2. q. 112. art. 5.
men may be so certain that they are in grace, that this their assurance shall
be free from all fear and staggering (says Vega, reported by Gregory de
Valentia. And touching assurance Greg. de Valent. tom. 2. p. 957. Medina quo
supra. Staplet. de Iusti. lib. 9. cap. 11. Dom. Bannes 22 q. 18. art. 4.
of eternal life, the same Medina says, that he would have every believer
certainly to hope that he shall obtain eternal life. And of the same opinion
are all the rest of them, save that they will have this certainty to be of hope,
and not of faith: and so the difference is in words, and not in the thing; for
they make it to be without doubting or wavering, firm and assured, as well as
we.

56. That concupiscence is a finne in the regenerate, is affirmed 10.
by Protestants; contrary to the received doctrine of the Church of Rome: and
yet many Romanists themselves shake hands with the Protestants in this point:
as Ribera a Jesuit, R^b^r com. in He^. 12.
who writing upon the twelfth of the Hebrews says, that by sin hanging fast
upon, is meant the concupiscence of the flesh against the holy Spirit, which
the Apostle uses often to call by the name of sin: and Tanner, another
Jesuit, acknowledgeing Tanner exam. Hu^. Reucl. c. 13.. sed quia.
that concupiscence in the regenerate, is called sin by the Scripture, says,
that it is a great wickedness, to traduce as blasphemous, the manner of
speech, true in it self, and imitating the Scriptures: yea, and Stapleton
calls it a certain iniquity, Stap. de concupiscent. in Renat. lib. 3. cap.
2. Bell. de Iustif. l. 4. cap. 13. Cassand. confut. art. 2.
and obliquity not only against the dominion of the mind, but also against the
Law of God. Now Bellarmine tells us, that whatsoever is contrary to the Law
of God, is mortal sin. Cassander plays the Protestant in direct terms in
this point: for he says, that if we respect sin as an iniquity or disease,
which must be resisted by the spirit, lest it burst forth into unlawful acts,
concupiscence is not unfitly called sin: but if we respect it as an offense
to God, and guiltiness to which punishment and damnation is answering, it is
not thus sin in the regenerate.

57. Touching marriage of Priests, which the Church of Rome condemns, as
execrable, filthy and abominable; and we allow as holy and lawful: we have
their own Doctors 11.
on our side, and against their own mother. Gratian says, Great. Cause. 26. q.

Cassand. consul. art. 23. Eras. annot. in 1. Tim. 3. p. 533.
that marriage of Priests is not prohibited either by legal, or Evangelical,
or yet Apostolical authority, but by Ecclesiastical only. Espenseus says,
that for many hundred years after the Apostles time, by reason of the want of
others, Priests were married. Caietane affirms, that if we stand only to
the tradition of Christ and his Apostles, it cannot appear by any authority
or reason, that holy order can be any hinderance to marriage, either as it is
an order, or as it is holy. Pius the second, one of their own Popes,
affirms, that it is better for a Priest to marry, then to burn, though he
have vowed the contrary: and that there be many reasons to forbid Priests
marriage, but more to allow it. Panormitane, Cassander, Erasmus, do all agree,
that in regard of the monstrous and filthy effects that follow a vowed single
life, it were better both for Gods glory, and the avoiding of scandal in the
Church, that liberty of marrying were granted to all men. And Espenseus and
Agrippa do grieve and Espens. com. in Tit. c. 1. Agrip. de v^^it. cap. 64.
blush, to behold rather Concubines and Stews to be permitted to their
Clergy, then lawful wives.

58. The Popes Primacie, or rather Supremacy in all affairs, 12.
and over all persons, challenging the jurisdiction of both swords, and
authority of supreme Iudicatures in cases of controversy, and interpretation
of Scripture with an infallibility of Judgment, is the very foundation of
Popery: and yet the same is razed not only by Protestants, but by many of
their own rank, that are both by name and profession Papists. Concerning his
temporal Jurisdiction, so stiffely maintained by Bellarmine and the Jesuits;

and 10. Bell. de Romans Pontif l. 5. c. 7.
affirm, that this power was never given unto Peter. Espens^us condemns it
in direct terms. Tolosanus confesses, that for two hundred years after
Christ, it was never read, that Christians attempted any thing against their
Emperors: and that this was not for want of strength (as Bellarmine would have
it: he says* that even then they did not attempt any such thing, when in
number and strength they might make their party good: but in this extolled
their Religion above all other, by defending this most holy doctrine, That all
men ought to obey the Magistrates. The notable and learned Treatises of Barclay
a French man, Blackwell, Warberton, etc. our Contrymen, all professed
Romanists, do peremptorily and plainly by many reasons confute the same.
Touching his spiritual jurisdiction, though there be few of them that
gainsay that, yet Greg. mag. l. 4. Epist. 32. 3^. 38. 39
Gregory the great, one of their own Popes, may stand in stead of many, who,
by many letters, both to the Emperor, and Bishop of Constantinople, shows,
that no man ought to be an universal Bishop over therest; calling that name in
detestation, vain, proud, profane, blasphemous, mischievous, Antichristian,
against the commandments of God, and decrees of Councils; and peremptorily
says, that he is a follower of Satan, and a forerunner of Antichrist, that
assumeth it to himself.

59. And that the Pope is not the supreme Judge in the Church, nor of
infallible judgment, but the Scripture only; many of them are of opinion
as well as we. Aquinas says, that the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles is
the rule of our Aquin. in 1. Tim. 6. lect. 1. Antonin. Sum. part. 3. tit. 18.
c. 3.. 3. Gerson. de Comun sub vtra. que specie. Clingius loc. lib. 3. c. 29.
p. 292. Peresius. Bell. de verbo Dei, l. 1. c 2. Vict. relect. 4. number. 6.
understanding. Antoninus says, that God has spoken but once, and that in the
holy Scripture, and that so plentifully, to meet with all temptations, and all
cases that may fall out. Gerson says, that the Scripture is the rule of our
faith, which being well understood, no authority of men is to be admitted
against it. Gonradus Clingius says, that the Scripture is the infallible rule
of truth, yea the measure and Judge of the truth. Peresius says, that the
authority of no Saint is of infallible truth, for that honor is due only to
the Scripture. Yea, Bellarmine their Ringleader confesses the Scripture to be
the most certain, and most safe rule of faith. Franciscus Victoria says, that
the Pope, in dispensing against the Decrees, Councels, and former Popes, may
err and grievously sin. Alphonsus de Castro diueth deeper, and says,
Alphons. de Cast. l. 1. c. 4. aduers. haeres. Bozius tom. 2. de sig. Eccles. l.
28 c. vlt. Almayn. Qu. in Vesper.
that every man, yea the Pope, and that as he is Pope, and Pastor of the
Church, may be deceived. Bozius pierces yet deeper, and says, that the Pope
may be an Heretic, yea write, teach, and preach heresy. And lastly, Almayne
says, that the power of not erring in the faith is not always in the Pope. Are
not all these now Protestants in this point? But for fuller satisfaction in
this point, I refer the Reader to the reverent and judicious Deane of
Winchester, Doctor Morton, with others, who have largely and learnedly
discovered this matter in their writings.

60. The like might be shown in all other points: these few instances
therefore shall suffice for this time, to persuade that it is far more safe
to subscribe to the Religion of Protestants, then of Romanists: seeing we hold
nothing, which many of their own rank and order do not maintain as well as
we; and what, I pray you, could move them thus to do, being sworn subjects
to the Church of Rome, but the evidence of truth, which shined so clearly to
their consciences, that they neither could, nor durst gainsay the same?

Conclusion.
NOw then, gentle Reader, these things being thus clearly proved, viz, First,
that the Religion of the Church of Rome gives open liberty to sin.
Secondly, that it maintayneth by the grounds thereof, things forbidden by all
laws, Divine, Natural, and Humane. Thirdly, that it imitateth the Jews in
those things, wherein they are enemies to Christ. Fourthly, that it derogateth
from the glory of Gods mercy, and efficacy of the merits of Christ, in the
work of our redemption. Fifthly, that it refuses to be tried by the
Scriptures, and will be judged and tried by none, but it self. Sixthly, that it
is at defiance and professed enmity with the sacred Scriptures. Seventhly, that
it maintayneth gross and palpable Idolatry. Eighthly, that it is contrary to
it self by manifest contradictions. Ninthly, that it is apparently opposite to
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Tenthly, that it nourishes gross and barbarous
ignorance amongst the people. Eleuenthly, that it was never known nor heard of
in the Apostles time, nor in the primitive Church. Twelfthly, that it vpholdeth
it self by unlawful, unjust and ungodly means: and lastly, that it is
dangerous and unsafe, both in respect of Gods glory, man's conscience, and
Christian charity. I say, all these things being thus clearly demonstrated;
what remains, but that we abhor the same, as the Religion of the great
Whore, and her Paramour Antichrist, who with their cup of fornications, and
vain pretext of Peter's authority, have besotted heretofore all Nations of the
earth? and cleave to the sincerity of the Gospel, taught and professed in the
Church of Protestants, which is free from all these imputations; for it neither
gives liberty to sin, nor maintayneth any thing that is unlawful, nor
imitateth the Jews; ascribes all the work of our redemption to Gods mercy,
and Christ's merits only, desires to be tried and examined by the Scriptures;
reuerenceth the fullness and perfection thereof; abhors all show of
Idolatry, is not at enmity and opposition, but keeps a sweet harmony with it
self: does not cross the Gospel, not so much as in show: condemns and
labors against ignorance; is agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostles, and
primitive Church; maintayneth it self by no unlawful means: and lastly, has
great safety and security, in the profession thereof. Good Christians must
be like good Goldsmiths, who will not take a piece of gold of any man's word,
but will try it by the touchstone, and weigh it in the balance. The Truth is
like gold: it behooves all therefore, to try it and weigh it, before they
entertayne it into their souls, lest they receive in stead of pure metal,
that which is counterfeit and light; try therefore these two Religions, which
of them has the truth, and without partiality or affection retain the good,
and reject the counterfeit: remember that the truth of Christians (as Saint
Augustine says) is more Aug. Epist. ad Hieron. Ambros. in Ser.
beautiful incomparably, then Helene of the Grecians: and that it alone (as
Saint Ambrose says) freeth; alone saves; alone washes: and therefore though
it be hid in a deep pit (as the Philosopher said) yet it is diligently to be
dug for, of all them that desire the salvation of their souls. In a word,
let not the dark mists of error and superstition blind thine eyes, but open
them wide to the beholding of the bright light of truth, that shines round
about thee, and know, that if the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
perish, in whom the god of 2. Cor. 4.
this world has dazeled their minds, that they should not see the light of
the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ. I desire no more credit at thy hands,
then the evidence of these reasons produced do require: and therefore if they
be true, then yield assent unto them for thine own souls sake: if they be
false, declare for my souls sake wherein the falsehood lurketh, and I will be
as ready to recant, as thou to refute. The Lord of his mercy anoint both our
eyes with the eye-salue of his Spirit, that we may see the truth, and supply
them with the oil of his grace, that we may bow and bend unto it, and
strengthen us with his divine power, that we may constantly profess and
persevere in the same to our lives ends: faxit Deus for his only begotten
Son, and our only blessed Savior Jesus Christ's sake, to whom b^ all honor,
power, majesty, preeminence, and dominion, for ever and ever.
