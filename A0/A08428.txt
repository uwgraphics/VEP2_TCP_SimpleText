Cum Priuilegio

TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE, JAMES BY THE GRACE OF GOD KING OF GREAT
BRYTAIN^, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith.
I DOUBT not (Dread So^ueraine) but that by some means the report of the
strange, and wonderful things which lately have happened in these Netherlands
are come to your grace, knowledge, where at all the world bear stands so much
amazed and astonished: but whether your Majesty has been informed of at the
parti^ularities, I justly doubt, because I can not by any ways understand,
that your Highness is any whit moved Meta^li. 1. tex. 1.
therewith. Aristotle says. Omnes hommes naturaliter scire desiderant. All
men have a natural desire to attain to the true, and perfect knowledge of
things: but the wiser, and learneder sort are especialy adicted thereunto,
principaly, when the object is admirable, of weight and importance: for then as
it yields unto their spirits extraordinat^e contentment and perfection, so to
be ignorant thereof, puts them in hazard of error, no^^ble damage, and
confusion. Whence has proce^ded the exquisit diligence and curious
inquisition, which we have seen used in this present matter, not only by our
Prelates, Doctors, and Professors of learning, unto whom the direction of our
souls in the way of God does chiefly appartaine, but also by the temporal
Princes, No^^li^e, and men of civil pol^^cie, whose wisdom and due regard of
their own credites, d^sdained, to p^rmit them selves to be led by the noses, to
the future peril of their souls, together with the present disparagement of
their honors, and seputations. The which manner of these men's proceeding in
this affair, gave me occasion to suspect, that your Majesty was not
sufficiently informed hereof: for other wise, it is not to be imagined
(consideration being had of the common and general opinion which men here
conceive of your Graces singular prudence, and lite^arure) that your Royal
wisdom would pass over these things as though your grace had no apprehensi^n
or esteem thereof, which of very many are held as most per^icious, and
abominable, in the sight both of God and m^n: and of innu merable others are
reputed as most venerable, and glori^us demonst^ations of our Lord his sweet
love care and providence ^owardes his loving Spouse his Church* which he
vouchsafes to adorn in this honorable and admirable manner.

Upon which conjecture my Gracious lord and souueraine I have adventured to
send unto your Princely view the authentical ^elat on of diverse things, which
in these last years have happened amongst us: a subject undoubtedly not
unworthy your ma^^re consideration, and exquisit judgment. And I have
labored to translate it out of the Fie^ch copy, not that I thinck your
Majesty ignorant of that language, but that by the way I might also satisfy
the greedy desire of many your ma^esties loving subjects, who have alredie
hard the b^uit but yet have not had the assured and certain knowledge of the
matter. And I am the more bold to write unto your Majesty of these things,
considering what by others has bin done unto great Emperors, and kings in the
like case. For I read that Pome^^s Diverse authors who have vvr^tten to Princes
of mir^cles
Pilate wrote unto Tyberius Caes^r touching the miracles of our Lord and
Savior. I note how the famous. Nicephorus dedicated his Ecclesiastical
history to Andronicus Paleologus the Emperor, in which history, (amongst
other things) sundry worthy miracles are comprised. I find that our renoumed
contrieman Venerable B^de directed unto King Coolulphe his miraculous histor^e
of our English Saxons con^ersion to the says of Christ. I have seen (to omit
p^oli^itie in this matter) the book which the Abbor and congregation of the
mon^ks of Most Sorr^to offered unto the French king now living co^tayni^g a
narration of certain miracles wrought at the said mont Serr^to. Again I have
bin much hartned to present this relation unto your Majesty, in regard of the
great opinion and esteem the worthy, godly, and Prudent Princes of these
Contries have of this matter, which they have manifested by their often
Pilgnmages to the place of Montaig^e, where also by their goodly, rich^, and
stately ornaments and oblations they have given a^l the world to un 'erstand
the high regard, and account they make hereof. But chiefly I have been animated
here unto, for that it is not unknown, what extraordinary pleasere and
contentment, your Majesty takes to employ your Roial labors in those things,
that appertain unto God.

What things do more apertaine unto God (Gracious Sovereign, then miracles*
which is as much to say, as those works which can be wrought only by God, of
which rank these (where of here relation is mad^) are believed to be, as
being semblable unto those divine operations, where by the Savior of the
world did manifest h^s Godhead to the world. For here your Grace may behold,
how the blind see, the deaf hear, the lame walk, the devils are ex pelled he
leaporous are made clean, and many other painful, deformed and desperate
maladies are cured.

I know it would be a great miracle if these works would be admitted ^f all men
for miracles. Wherefore I am humbly to entreat your gracious patience, to
peruse what here I have set down in an swear of those objections, whereby I
find them ord narilie to be oppugned I fear that I shall be deemed of many to
be over prolix, but I beseech them to consider, that it is Gods cause which I
handle, and that I endeavor to inform my gracious Lord and Prince in such
sort of the verity hereof, that with greater light and assurance he might
pronounce his expected royal sentence, to the glor^e of God, his own honor,
and inestimable commodity of many thousands. And although I have not here so
convenient place to utter the hundre^h part of those things which otherwise I
wou^d therefore I intend (by our Lords h^lp) here after more to enlarge my self
herein as occasion shall b^ offe^ed*

Who is he (gracious Sovereign) that has but half an eye and sees not of what
consequence it is for any Society of people to be assisted with the presence
of miracles? For where miracles are seen to favor the persons, o^ things that
appertain to their Congregation, who can deny but that God is well plea^ed which

creature Benedictus Dominus what authority miracles have to prove Religion.
Deus Israel, qui facit m^r ^bilia solus. Blessed be the lord God of Israel
who only works maruclous things or miracles as the Prophet says. When
therefore he vou^hsafeth to work any miracle i^ the desence or honor of any
person o^ any point belonging to any Re^igion, or belief, such a miracle is as
it were his very word, and souetaine ^iuine sentence, given upon the same,
which n^ne may d^ny, gainsay, or doubt of, without note of infidel^^^e, and
saculegious blasphemy. The ho^y Sc^iptures by the devil himself, and many
Heretics both are, and have been fowly and wickedly cited, and interpreted:
the testimonies of the ancient holy Fathers are by diverse sects diue sly
abused: the old ^amou^ Marty^s Confesso^s, and Virgins are challenged of many,
and as it were violently hailed into their Congregations, as if they had bin of
their churches, and professious: forme^ general Councels, Canons of Popes, and

impugners of the Catholic Church d^aw not into their books, sermons, and
disputations, but at miracles al parties must m^k^ a stand, and be silent;
there, God him self alone must speak, and show himself, for such woorks are
out of all the reach of a^y fi^^te and created power, none being able to rule
the chariot of this Sun, but only such losuaes, as unto whom our Lord will
vouchsafe to grant so great authority, and commaund^e. Which the wisdom of

himself should affirm, and auerre their preaching by his miraculous Mat 11.

working, as it is said: Conuocatis duod^cim distipu^is suis, dedit ^^^^
potestatem spirituum immundorum, vt ^^cerent ^os, and (...) omnem languorem and
omnem infirmitatem. Having called his twelve disciples together, he gave them
power over unclean sperus, that they should cast them out, and should ^^^^ al
diseases, and al infirmiti^s. Which unspeakable goodness and providence of God,
if we will duly consider, we may evidently see his incomprehensible wisdom,
and love toward us his most unworthy Creatures, in providing for our
instruction in his ways such affored means, whereby, to ieaine the truth,
and to avoid al er^our: that if all the world would have laid their heads
together to invent a way* they could not God can not wor ke miracles for the
proof of any falls religion.
have found a more perspicuous* more profitable, or more glorious then this,
which he of his blessed mercy has vouche safed unto us, for God being he
truth it self, he ca^ not by his omnipo^e^cie give his ^estimonie to any error
or falsehood: and being very goodness it self, it is impossible that he will
permit us to be seduced by any his extraordinary supernatural operations,
neither can he or will he yield a^y honor to that, which in it self is evil. For
as truth is a thing perfectly good and the child of God, so falsehood is
detestable and naught, and the wicked impe of the devil. Of which thing that
renoumed and famous champion of Gods Church Saint Augustine Aug. q. 114 de
quaestionibus no u^ and ve^e^is testame^ti.
had a true and perfect conceit, Who savd: Ow^nes Philosophi, and sectarum
inuentores, ^^^^^sis desputationibus mu^cem se confuderunt. Nullus (...)
alterum transie^s, quia vnusquisque in quo imbutus fuer^t permanebat. All the
Philosophers, and sectmaisters, confounded each other by sundry disputes.
Never any one of them yielding to the other for every one held to that which
once he had ^^a^ned. Behold the ordinary issue of a^^wranglings and
contentions, even amongst the wittie^ and learneder sort. But he proceeds:
Hinc sactumest vt Dei prouidenti^ (cu^us sensus inuestigari non potest)
pr^dications suae virtutem adiungeret, vt veritas predicationis virtutis
testimonio probaretur: vt qui verbis contradi^erent, virtutibus non auderent.
Hence it came to pas that the providence of God, (whose sense no man can fyud
out) ^o^^ed power to his preaching, that the truth of his preaching might be
proved by the testimony of his power: that if any would ga^ne^^y his words,
they should not date to contradict his powerable works. And that glorious
doctor S. Gregory for his rare learning and wisdom surnamed the great,
speaking of the miracles of God and Greg. hom. 1^ in Es^ch
his Saints confirms the same saying. H^ quam vera de Deo dixerint,
testantur miracula, quia tal^a p^^ ^ll^m non facerent, nisi vera de illo
n^^rarent. How truly these people have spoken of God, their miracles be^^^
vv^tt^es for they could never work such things by him, if they had not spoken
truly of him. Whereby we see of what force and authority miracles are to
persuade men to accept of that doctrine, which otherwise by their reason they
can not comprehend. And the said holy Doctor proceeds, adding an other point
worthy the noting. S^ ^gitur de side tentamur, quam ex illorum pr^dications
concepimus, loqu^tium miracula conspici^^^. and in side qu^^ ab ers accep^mus
confirm^^ur: quid erg^ illorum miracula, nisi ipsa sunt nostra prepugnacula^ If
therefore we be tempted about our faith, vvich^ by their preach^^g we have
learned, we behold the miracles of our Preachers, and thereby ^^^ confirmed in
the faith, which from them we have recti^ed therefore what other things are
their miracles but that they are our fortresses! Which conclusion seems to be
so just, and sounded in reason, that I thinck there is none that dare so much
as doubt of it, much less deny it.

Yet I confess though the devil cannot make me^ to deny this evident
principle, notwithstanding he endeavors to make void the force and authority
thereof. For when he dare not coap with his armed adversary, if he can
persuade him to cast away his weapons, he nothing doubts but that then he
shall Pra^e^lus de vi^is H^ ^e^. lib 14 n^. 13.
easily subdue him. So I read that he dealt with a certain kind of miscrea^^s
called vv^^denses or Poor men of Lions, who amongst diverse other their ^^wd
blasphemies and heresies, were persuaded to auoue he that God never wrought any
miracles in his Church: whereby the s^btil enemy iuducing them, and others by
them to dispoile the Church of her miracles, it was ve^ie easy for him
afterward to make men despise, what-soeuer upon the credit of miracles the
said Church might argue against them. Unto which poor wittles people certain
others do nearly approache, who although they will perhaps confess al such
miracles as are contained in the books of holy Scripture: Yet because they
thinck that not long after the time that those books were written, either ^el
gates prevailed against the rock of the Co^t^^^^ to our sauioures promis and
vvarr^t. Math 16 Math. 5.
Church, or that the City builded upon an hill, was over covered with some
Egyptian duskie darcknes, or else shut up in some unknown cave and valley:
consequently they infer that there never apeared miracles since that change
whereby they will have us believe that either they have quite perished, or else
have been wrought in ^ugger mugger and in great secret. For as they know where
smoke is there comonlie is some fire, and where they see a shadow they must
confess the presence of some body: so if they should grant the perpetual
course of miracles, they must also grant the perpetuity of that Church for
which and in which they have bin wrought.

In the discovery of which their absurdity I might For in his Acts and
monume^tes.
first allege them the testimony of their own Fox, who tells us of diverse
miracles appertaining to his martyrs.. But they may answer me, that Fox is
fabulous, I yield he is so, for that he is easily proved so to be, and I know
it would be lost and lewd labor for any to endeuo^^ to prove the contrary In
his vvatchevvord.
Yet would I learn what they repute those benedictions to be, which Sir
Francis Hastings, and almost every preacher and gospeller affirm that God has
heaped upon our Realm, since the alteration of Religion was made therein If
they be but the ordinary mercies of God, as he makes his Sun Math. ^.
to rise upon the good and bad, and sends down his rain upon the just and
unjust: then they make no more for their Gospel, then the like do for the
Turks (...): or else they can p^o^ue unto ^s that God has supernaturally
blessed them only in regard of their Religion, thereby manifesting unto them
and others, that England professes his true faith, and that his true worship
only flo^sheth therein: which when I see them do, then both I and they must
grant them as many miracles, as they can score up their supernatural
blessings, and consequently we both must conclude that miracles are not yet
decayed. But because I know the things whereof they make this brag ^^e of the
wiser soi^e esteemed presumptions, fantasies, inventions, and meet sopperie
therefore I leave it to each man's wisdom to infer hereof the continuance of
miracles (...) be pleases. And I wish them rather to peruse the writings and
volumes of those that have set down the infinite miracles which by diverse holy
Persons and in diverse holy places amongst Catholics have been wrought. To
reci^e here the only bare names of those that have most laudably emploted
their labors ^etem, would be an ^^dles travail: where the^ should I begin? how
shall I proceed? and when shall I make an end, if I would undertake to rehearse
the sundry particulatities touching this matter which in these Authors I find
registered?

But I know as they blesh not to deny so evident a truth as is the continuance
of miracles so will they not be ashamed to contem^e, disgrace, and scorn al
such as have recorded them, nothing regarding the opinion o^ esteem* that
either the Christian world now has, or ever had of their wisdom, sanct^^e,
learning, sincerity, and discretion. Yet if they will not credit those writers
who have penned the gestes and miracles of particular persons, and places, at
leastwise let them not disdain the public records, and Cronicles of whole
Kingdoms and nations: especially in such things as by the people of the said
kingdoms and nations are generally held and confessed to be true; yea, which
often times the Croniclers of other Realms and common wekhes do acknowledge
and a^o^che with them, without any difference, doubt, or contradiction.

In those public monuments they may read how the said dominions and countries
received first their Christianity, and withal they shall find, that miracles
were still a principal motive and instigation there ^^^o. It is not unknown how
the faith of Christ was preached in Jury, how it was aftervard spread through
Greece, Italy, Spain and other Cuntries, where the Apostles, and Disciples of
Christ preached. I suppose few will deny but that they did work miracles in all
places wheresoever they came to teach the Gospel for so it is written: Illi
autem profecti pr^dicauerunt vbique: Domino cooperant^, and sermon confirmd to
seq^e^tib signis. But they going forth preached every where, our Lord vvorking
vvithal, and confirming the word with signs that follovved. Let them only
peruse the later ages, and let them pass through them successively, by every
Nation as ^t was converted. And if it please them they may began with that
people which now we call French, and they shall see, that the French men hold
that they received their faith by Hi^c^^rus in eius vita. Heda (...) Hist See
^o^: de signis Ecclesi^.
the preaching and miracles of S. Remigius, and others: likewise we ^^g^sh say
that our conue^^ion was first wrought by the ^^^cuo^rs and miracles of. Sanct
Augusti^ the monk, and of his fellows. The Danes and Suct^^ns affirm that S.
R^embertus by preaching, and working of miracles made them Christians. The
People of Bahemia tell that they were converted by ^. ^. cap. 1. and 2.
the miracles first of two Brethren called Cirillus and Methodius, and then of
the holy Duchess Ludmilla, and of their king Venc^sel^us. The Sclauonians have
in their records that they were brought to the faith by the labors and miracles
of S. Bonifacius The Polonians with their Prince Miesc^ by means of a miracle
were first baptized. The Hungarians by miracles, and the industry of
Adalbertus bishop of Prage and of their Prince G^isa became Christians. The
Tarta^a^s with their king Cassanus submitted them selves to the faith of
Christ, being moved there unto by a notable miracle Almost in our age the west
Indies began by the miracles of Martinus Valentinus and Al^^si^^ Bertrandus to
admit the Christian belief. And to conclude the East India by the miracles of
Consaluus Sil^erius. of the blessed Francis Xa^erius, and of Gasper surnamed
Belga al th^^^ of the Soci^ie of the holy name of Jesus began likewise to
forsake their Paganism, and to embrace the doctrine of Christ Jesus.

What may any reasonably answer to this Historical demonstration and Chronical
deduction of the perpetuity and continuance of miracles? Will this opposite
people say for all this, that these heathens were never brought to make
acceptance of Christ his Gospel by miracles, can they by any sufficient authors
or convenient proofs show us the contrary? will they ^^^^ us in the mouths
that al these are fictions, and standing still upon their bare and incredulous
denial, give thely to all the monuments, traditions and writers of al these
kingdoms and Nations? Be it so if of force without any reason they will have it
so, yet I will demonstrate unto the^ (if they will not ^eny their own w^^tes)
that they must necessarily grant so many successi^e miracles as there have
bin cunitries and People who have embraced the faith without the motive of
external miracles.

For what can be more miraculous then to see so many great and barbarous
nations with their Kings and Nobles, settled in a Religion by themselves and
all their aunce^ers, ind^e^ whith great Honors, riches pomp and preuileges,
taught and magnified by their own Priests, whose credit and necessary
maintenance de ended thereon: by which their paga^ religion they were lice^
ed^o co^mitt almost what s^euer their proud, vnbri^eled licentious sensual
appetites could desire? What could be more miraculous I say, then to see these
people at the bare preaching and ass^ueration of some Bishops or Priests, (yea
imagine and say of some superintende^ts and ministers) who should teach them,
that the God which they ought to believe and adore, i^ three persons and yet
but one God: that one of these persons is both man and God, two natures but one
person: whose mother both before his birth, in his birth, and after his birth
was always a pure virgin, and an immaculate maid: and that this God ^f^er he
had for the space of some years endured many mise^es, indignitie^, sclaunde^s,
and persecutions of certain men that maligned him, was afterward bet^a^ed to
them and atached by them, and after sundry disgrac^s and afflictions most
cruelly and shamefully hanged* and put to death. Yea supo^e that these
preachers should have ^ould then, that this God in his life time wrought many
miracles* and that ^f^e^ his death he did ^se again to life, and ascended up o
heaven: whether also these Pagans and Silua^^oe^ should come, if they would
throw down their Gods, ^est oy their ^emples, fortake their Priests, abnor
then sac^ fices suffer their ^eades to be washed in the name of God, for the
remission of their sinne^, and w^thal if they, would embrace chastity,
m^^k^nes, patience, penn^n^^, humility, and believe many things surpassing
their understanding and submit them selves to diue^s other things contratie to
their sense, yea alto gether opposite to their pride, and (...)ertie which
before they enjoyed. He that will say that such people as these were brought to
this, without an exceeding great miracle, if not by many miracles, I will not
say that he is a miracle, but surely I think your Royal wisdom will deem and
judge him a wonde^ous monster.

Furthermore I beseech your Majesty to consider if a reprobate Jew were to
demand of these negative people, whether they thought our Lord God did more
honor, or gave more preuileges to the new law, or to the old, that is, (as
true Christians would say) to the woork of Christ, or to that of Moses: to
that which was in ^e^^e substa^oe Alvvaies miracles in the ty me of the old
l^vve.
or to the figure thereof: to that which was the perfection, or to that which
was to be perfected? What answer I pray your Grace will they shape him? A shame
on the^ if they would give the sinagoge the upper hand, and shoulder down the
Gospel, for that were avery uncivil or rather ungodly t^ick of a Gospeller. And
yet the Jew will demonstrate unto the, how out Lord adomed and assisted his
people and ancestors with miracles, and powrable works above the force of
Nature all the time of Moy^es, of their Judges, of their kings, of their
Prophets even in the time of their captivity, ^n the time of their Machabe^
yea and of our Sau our Christ him self, as is manifest by the perpetual miracle
of the Pr^^^^ic^ Pis^ina Yea what if the said Jew standing upon the proof and
prerogative of miracles should therein prefer the state of those that lived
only under the law of Nature before us that live in the law of grace: For he
will tell them of the miraculous Miracles in the first state of nature.
sacrifice of Abel, of the translation of E^^ch of his perpetual miraculous
conservation in Paradise ever since, of the coming of al kinds of living
creatures to N^^ his Ar^k of their more then admirable manner of nuriture,
agreement, and abode in the same, of the waters of the universal de^uge, of the
confusion of tongues, of the destruction of Sodom and Go^norha, of the
preservation of Lot with his daughters, of the metamorphosis of his wife into a
pillar of ^ault, of the vocation of Abraham, of ^l ^is visions, of the often
apar^tions of Angels both to him and others, of the generation of Isaac, of his
miraculous delivery, of so many miracles wrought in the behalf of Jacob,
Joseph, Moses, and the people of Israel both in Egypt, and when they were
departed thence, ^ntil the time that the law was delivered them. When the Jew
has thus out-braued the Church of Christ with their miracles, will these peo
ple that can not digest the perpetual course thereof amongst Christians, brook
that the Church which our lord and savior chose as his most loo^ng spowse,
wherein he promised to abide to the end of the world, which he bought with his
most precious blood, and adorned with so great and most worthy Sacraments,
should be destitute of such a grace, should be bereaved of so necessary a
strength, should be deprived of so convenient and needeful a glory?

If they will not be a shamed to play thus the base cra^c^s, and so much to
disgrace the honor of the Christian Religion, and the most honorable work of
Christ Jesus, then I chalendge them to show us some ancient and authentical
Writers. Chronicles, Records. Doctors, or learned writers that ever noted the
time when God withdrew his powrable hand from these kind of supernatural
wo^kes or that ever they should end so long as his Church should last. But they
can never do it, as we on the other side are able to show them the perpetual
course and succession of miracles in the Catholic Church, even from the
Apostles days to ours, as that learned and eloouent Father I evvis Richeo^^
has al^edy done in Louys Richco me au discourse des miracles chap 16. number. 2
his discourse of miracles, dedicated to the French king now living: and I hope
ere long they shall further perceive by that huge and ^nfinit mass of hese
matters, which the Reuerand* learned, and worthy Father Giles Scond^nck Rector
of ^ur English Seminary in Saint Omers has gathred together, and that only
of such things, as in this kind have happened in these two latter ages: which^f
the world sh^l once see him publish in that authentical manner as he intends,
it w^l not be a little astonished to thinck that ever there should have (...)en
amongst men men so bra^e^ faced, or blockishignorant, that either durst or
could make so shameful a doubt, much less so desperate a denial ^f this ever
flowing current of miracles.

But it maybe these good so le^a^^ thus scrupulous ^n acknowledging this
cu^^e^t^n regard of the word of God: f^^ as t^e^ take themselves to be the
only champions and protectors of the word* so have they solemly and s^r^ou^^ly
told us, that they will neither teach or learn or b^^^^ue any thing, which is
not exp^ess^^y, or by n^^essa^e ^n^crp^^tation in the w^^^d. ^e it so, let us
enter with them into the word. There we read that the power of working miracles
was given to the first Pastors of the Church. I confess it. Now let them show
me by the word, or any good gloss of the word, that this power was recalled,
yea or that e^e it was to be Math (...) Marc 6. (...) ^uc. 9. 10.
recalled. I find in the word and book of God, that when our Savior gave
power of working miracles vnt his Apostles, he gave ^t unto them together with
their power of preaching, which power to preach he also gave in them unto al
their successors, who never were to have an end until the world did end: Even
so when our Savior gave them authority to work miracles, under the like
Ephesians. 4.
form of words, it is not to be doubted but in them he endued their
successors with the same miraculous power, acording to the exige^ce of his
Church, which power should never expire, or^l l^^ them ^y the text show us the
contiarie. Again I read tha^ ^^r Ma^h. 2^ ^vv^ things promi^e^ by Christ that
should perpetuall^ remain in his Church^
Lord said: Ecce ego vobiscum sum omnibus d^^bus vsque ad consummationem
sacul^* behold I am whith you ^l da^es enen unto the consummation of ^he world
Where our benign Lord promi^e^h that his A^ostles and disciples should
continue to the end o^ the world and he with them, not with them in their ^wn
persons for they are dead and departe^ hence, ^herfore with them in their
succ^ssors with whom a^^o his perpetual favorable assistance was to rema^n
without any diminution or limitation, and that by them he would adorn and
fortify his Church with the self same power of miracles, where with at the
beginning in his Apostles he establishe^ it. By which promise we may conce^^e
inestimable comf^rt* in beeng still assured of his divine ^^ese^ce amongst us in all our losses and crosses, and therefore we can not imagine how it is likely that
when the pa^an pe^secutors, and Heretics* should oppo^e, cha^^tie wa^ cold,
faith be scarce found in the world, that then our most loving lord would walk
up and down (...) ^lesly in heaven, and seem to have little regard how his
honor should be abused, his Church afflicted, his loving f^endes and children
trodden under foot, and the devil with his followers to seduce the world at his
pleasure.

Yes forsooth say they: Antechrist when he shall come he shall do strange
w^nders. And I tell them that the Egyptian magicians wrought strange Exodus 7.
8. Act ^
wonnders, and Simon Magus wrought strange wonnders, did therefore Moses and
A^^on work no miracles? Did saint Peter and the rest of the Apostles and
Disciples no miracles? shall En^ch and Elias hau^ Apoc. 11
no hand in miracles? It is impious to say or thinck, that when Antechrist the
man of sin, the chief of al He^etikes and falce prophets shall seek to outface
the Church of Christ with his diabolical wou^ders, that then the true miracles
of God shall no where apeare to confront his ungodly malice. Our lord has

Yet perhaps our contradictors will say, that miracles are not now needful. It
is quickly said. I would to God the contrary could not be so easily and
perspicuousely proved, yea demo^strated. Were miracles necessary to convert

necessary to confo^nd He^etikes, and to reduce them back again to the Church
which they have fors^ken? Is a kings power and assistance only to be re^jo^^ed

the mutenous rebellion, and intestin sedition of his own subjects against him?

too too ^edious and loa^h^^m he^e to be reci^ed: all which v^doubtedly
proceed^ng from the devil, as from the first pa^ent and autho^ of al
i^fidel^itie and d^ssen^io^* it seems a thing most st^ange, yea altogether

affirm to be wrought in the Catholic Church) that either amongst all, or the
most, o^ at least among some of note this well.
these, he will not show what he is able to do in this kind, for the
establishing and gracing of their errors, or else by profaning the credit and
honor of miracles, that he will not assist every sect with his secret admirable
working, thereby to bring the world in doubt what faith to embrace, or else
thereby to despair ever to come to the knowledge of the only saving truth and
religion.

Furthermore if the deu^l be able to work such miracles as these, it is strange
that he would not there in have concurred with Nero, Simon Magus, Porph^rius,
I^^lian the Apostata, and Mahomet his most potent instruments, who wanted
nether power not malice to have e^ceedingly advanced his party. And surely by
nothing more could they have so born down the Gospel of Christ, then if they
had b^n able to have performed those miracles (as undoubtedly they greatly
desired) which our Savior, his Apostles, and Marty^s wrought in such
abundance.

But because these wretches saw how no power either of th^^t own or of their
seyndish Gods could extend it self to such works, they were forced (thereby to
shroud their own nakedness and ^urpitude) ^o condemn all these admirable
effects and operatio^s, saying they proceeded from witchcraft, ^orcene, and
the at^e Mag^ck Wherefore I would entreat the impug^ers of our Miracles to
teach us, ^y what good reason we or they may defend the pu^tie of the ancient
miracles of Christ, of his Apostles and martyrs against these their
calumniato^s; amongst whom some were so fatt persuaded that Christ himself was
a Magician, that they bl^shed not to affirm, that ^e had compiled a book of
that accursed at, and had Aug. de co^^ensu Euang. cap. 9 and 10.
dedicated the same to his two chief Apostles Peter and Paul. And this they
did to disgrace and deface the miracles that were objected against them by the
Christians, in defense of their faith.

But it is much to be feared that we shall have little help of our adversaries
in this matter, but that they will rather bear up those Pagans, Jews, and
mahome^anes by answering for them, and showing that the miracles aleaged by our
forefathers were tricks of magic, and sorcerie, for whatsoever they can in^ent
or imagine against these later miracles that are now wrought in the Catholic
Church, ^ndoubtedly a Pagan Turk or Jew will in like manner oppose against
those former of the Primit^ue Church, so that the argument of the old Doctors,
Marty^s, Apostles, and of Christ himself, drawn from the authority of miracles
shall be quite ouerthrown, and shall serve for no proof of the verity of our
Religion. It may be perhaps they will confound the Turks, Jews, and Gentiles
with scriptures, and out of them they will convince that the miracles of the
Primitive Church must be believed I know not what these worthy Scripturians
may more then miraculousely work with these miscreants when they shall once com
over them with their Scriptures, especially with the Pagans, who hitherto have
made no more esteem of the Bible, then of A^sops fables, o^ Ou^ds
Metamorphosis. But this I da^e say, ^f the Jews and perhaps the Mahometanes
once chance to buckle with the in those parts of the holy Scripture which they
admit, these goodly Bible-cla^k^s shall find them to have as hard ^eades, to
be as p^eu^st stiffnecked, and as w^l conceited of that own spirit in
interpreting Gods ^ook as the prowdest Gospeller that date once to coap with

produced for himself, and against them. And although he willed them to search
the Scriptures, and to examine them about his mission and authorit^^; that was
because upon former miracles they were well persuaded of the verity of the
scriptures; but when the Gentiles were to be converted, miracles were there
Scriptures, and only in them did they read that the Christian doctrine came
from God. So that miracles are more evident proofs of a true religion t^e^ are
the Scriptures, especially considering how Scriptures are so subject to falce
misconstruing* s^de ^l^sh bad interpretation, as experience most manifestly
demonstrateth. Whereby all the world may see and laugh at the absurdity of
those that say* we know your miracles are not of God, and if we demand, why so?
they will answer because your doctrine which they approo^e is not of God; and if
we would know of them the reason of so resolute an assertion they w^l tell ^s
because our Religion is not acording to the word of God. A reason forsooth that
the Jews, and Mahom^tans (as I said, may in like manner frame against (...)
Christian faith, and all the Heretics that either ^re, or have been, or ever
hereafter shall be may with as good proof aleage against whatsoever they shall
not please to admit, because it is not according to their gloss and
interpretat on of holy Scripture.

As the Catholic Church has certain assured good means to attain to the
true intelligence of holy Scripture thereby to au^ in all danger of error and
Heresi^, so has it most cu^dent notes whereby to discern falce de^ling from
true miracles, that the^eby she may no^b^^d cerued with witchcraft and
sorcerie, so that as upon those grounds she buil^^eth her assurance of her
true ^nderstanding of the word of God, so by these ma^ckes she comes to the

Likewise the Church disc^rneth true miracles from witchcraft by an other
sentence of our lord in the same place. For he says: Qu^ non est mecum* contra
(...) est: and qui non congregas mecum, spargit. He that is not with me, is
against me: and he that gathers not with me, d^sperseth. As if he would have
said: the devil who is mine enemy, and consequently is not with me does
nothing but that which he knows is most displeasing to me: and al his study
being how he may disunite. whom I have gathered together in true concord and
charity, the end of his work^ is to sever souls from God by sin, and to
break the mutual peace of my flock by sowing his seed of contention and discord
amongst them. For The wor kes of God and of the devil have contrary ^ades.
as the works of the devil are to disturb al concord in says and teligion,
and by leading men in-to sin to make them rebels and enemies to God his
divine majesty, so the miracles of God are wrought for the producing and
maintenance of unity in faith, and perfect union with almighty God in
unfeigned charity, which we see performed by these miracles, which are only
wrought in the Catholic Church, which Church in matter of belief is and
always has been perfectly united in it self, and whose doctrine allows of no
vice, but rather teaches all virtue, and has the best yea the only means to
advance men's souls to their spiritual and chiefest perfection. Again, the
Church discovers the collusion of the devil from the working of God, by
noting the means that are used in the purchasing of these miracles, which are
nothing else, but most serious prayer unto almighty God* ^oined with fasting
al^nes deeds, honoring of God his mother, and his holy saints his decrest and
most honorable friends: Which honor they do to them, for the more honor and
reverence they bear to God himself: Which th^n^s in holy scripture are
singuler^y commended whereas the contrary are the evident works of the devil,
and whosoever is adicted to them* o(...)y perseuereth in them, (be he of what
religion so^uet) can never be made pertaker of God his sweetenes in his
necessities by these miracles. Moreover, the Catholic Church sees that these
miracles are substancial works, notably and perfectly profiting the bodies
and souls of those unto whom they are imparted: Whereas the works of our
hateful enemy are rather hurteful and domageable to the creatures of God, then
any ways confortab^e unto them in their miseres and afflictions. We likewise
note that these miracles are in themselves perfect, and intiere; where as the
works of the de^^l are most commonly defective in many things. Also the works
of the devil are done for vain or pernicious ends, as that the workers (who
are always ^ad ungodly people) may be wound^red at, or that they may thereby
obtain some gain or filthy pleasure, or wreak their hatred and revenge against
their enemies: they are commonly wrought by certain secret, absurd, ridicul^us,
superstitious prayers, charms, signs, or circumstances: Which neue^ do
accompaine the Catholic miracles. And finally (for it is not necessary to
recount all the differences) if ever God perm^^t the devil to work any h^^
deceitful wounders in the behalf of any sect or heresy, they are soon
bewraied, if they be duly e^amined, they vanish away at the presence either of
faithful people, or of other true miracles, and they are fully discried in that
they oppugn the Religion that has been already established, and confirmed by
infinite most evident and assured miracles, by the confession of al antiquine,
by the consent of al nations, by the censure of al General Councels by the
assertions of al holy Fathers of all Histories of al Schools, of al
universities, by the triumphant deaths of innumerable Martyr^, by the
profession of infinite Confessors, Virgins, Lay and Religious people, of al
estates, degrees, and ages.

were done in the ve^w of hundrethes that were present: they have been all most
diligently and curiously examined by the Princes authority, and Civil
Magistrates in many Cities, towns, and other places, who never hitherto could
find the least suspicion in these matters of any such abhom^nable evil dealing.
And the like may be answered to those, who so confidently ^lea^g^, that these
things were performed by way of Physic, and in particular by the help of the
Philosophers stone, Folly in incre^ dulitie.
(good lord what do not men ^nuent when they would blind themselves that they
might not see the truth) whereby they show their stony hearts and heads.

Upon the^e men I fear that Apostolical sentence wil^e verified if they do not
repent them, R^^elatio^ ^ra De^ de caelo, super omnem imp^etatem and
intustitiam hominum eorum qui veritate^ De^ in iniusticea detinent. The wrath
of God from heaven is revealed upon al impeetie and injustice of those men that
dete^ne the verity of God in injustice. For how unjustly they have sought to
keep both from their own and other men's knowledge the truth of God, your
Royal wisdom may sufficiently perceive, first in not crediting God his
miracles, nor God, by his miracles, again, by wholly denying his miracles,
afterward, Iuda^cally that is impiousely att^^buting them to the damned devils
of hell, and finally uncharitably and iniu^^ousely condemning those whose
innocence and sincerity neither the diligent and war^e Catholic, nor the
curious prying mallicious Herenke could ever yet justly touch. Therefore I say
unto the^ with the Prophet Hodie si vocem Domini aud^^ritis, noli^e obdurare
corda vestra. If you will hear the voice of our Lord by miracles speaking and
prea h^ng unto yo^* c^e^ in ou^ days, and proclaming where he does reside,
denouncing unto you where you shall find him beware that you harden not your
ha^tes, as those old crasperating people did, unto whom ou^ lord did swea^e
being mo^ed with his just ang^t and disdain against their stubbernes and
^^^^^du the, that they should never enter into his rest, that they should never
have part of his eternal felicity.

Which heavy and dreadful ^oome they may auo^d if ^aying aside all animositie
and p^^^a^e affection, they would me^kely, that is, with Christian mode^tic,
patience, and humility for Christ his sake and for their own souls salvation
take the pains to vewe either with their corporal e^es, or with the attentive
eyes of their mind what is down in the mountain of Montaigue Where they may
see a most famous and frequent Pilg^image to a picture of the Mother of God, or
to a place chosen out by ^e^, wherein she shows her gracious favors to
humble and distressed suppliants: where they shall behold troops of penitent
sinners prostrate before the feet of their confessors, and declaring unto them
their ^respasses: where they efrsoones devoutly adore and receive the body of
God in the form of bread: where they are present at the continual celebration
of Masses: where they hear perpetual and reverent invocation of our Lady, and
of other Saints: where they attentively ha^ke^ to innumerable sermons and
exhortations, persuading those things which either the Catholic Church
commands, or counseleth to be believed and embraced, or meiting them to
avoid those things which the said Church either in faith or manners m^sl^keth
or condemns. And while The assu^ednes of the Catholic do ctrine.
these things and many other such like, are in doing, they shall often times
epsy the power and sweet goodness of God to descend upon the holy assembly,
whereby some that are blind receive their sight, some that are deaf recover
their hearing some that are leape^ous are cle^sed some that are possessed with
unclean spirits are ^reed from their tyran^e, others that are lame walk strong
homeward, leaving their crutches and s^iltes at the place for a memory, and
many other such supernatural miraculous operations to be their atch^eued:
where-by they may with us justly and with very good consequence infer, that
holy Pilgrimages, honoring of holy Images, confession of our sins to the
priest, acknowledging of the real presence of Christ his body in the blessed
Sacrament, celebration of Masses, praying to saints, yea (in brief) they may
insert the whole ^oct in and p^^ctis of the Catholic Apostolik and Roman
Church to be grateful and highely pleasing unto the Majesty of God: for
otherwise if these things were so wicked, blasphemous ^^urious abominable, and
execrable ^n^o him, (as our aduertanes would persuade men) it is to be thought,
that in his just and zealous indignation he would rather cause the earth to
swallow down even into hell both the place and people, then to permit them to
depart thence fraught with such unspeakable co^forts and ^^laces both of their
bodies and souls, as we daily perceive they do.

So that hereby every one may see, in what price and esteem the Catholic
Church is to our Lord, whose children he thus particulerly and only blesses,
and as it were vphouldeth in their faith with the hand of his powrable
celestial operatio^s, which he vouchsafes to impart unto them eue^ by the
means of ^o less then of his most loving and glorious Mother, and for her
glory, a circumstance ^^^^^ding al cause of doubt that the devil should have
any claw in this matter. For our lord has said: Inimi^itias ponam inter Genesis 3.
to and mulierem. I vvil put enm^tie betvv^xt thee and the woman. Whereby we
may understand that as the devil will never to his power permit her to be
honored, much less will he work wou^^ders to procute or inc^^a^^ her honor.
Neither will this blessed woman permit her enemy ever to abuse her due honor,
or to circum^e^t those that desire for her s^nnes sake, and for her own sake,
to serve and honor her; but let him use all the craft he can in^ent, and all the
force he has, yet shall our tr^umphant Judith have the perfect victory oue^
him. For, Ipsa cont^ret cap^^ tuum She shall crush thy ^^ad wicked and ^eend^s

majesty* now that he ^aigneth in his kingdom of glory, where, (as he
promised) he ministers to his servants* wi^h what respect does he behave
himself to his glorious best beloved and best deserving mother? let us behold
king Solomon in this point, who so honored his mother Bersab^^, that he ado^ed
her* that on his right hand he 3. Reg. ^.
placed a throne for her and sp^ke these dutiful words unto her Pe^e ma^er
^^a: ne^ue enim fas est vt auert^m faci^m tuam. Mother sh^vv your request: for
it is not l^vvful that I should turn your face from me.

That is: that I should suffer you to depart discontented from me. Which Salomo
did and said undoubtedly in regard of the natural duty which he knew he did owe
to his mother. For he had before his e^es that Exodus ^0
commandment of God. Honora Patrem tuum* and matrem tuam. Honor thy Father,
and thy mother. This precept our Savior Jesus does incomparably more respect
and observe, then Solomon either did or could: for that it was his own law, as
also for that it is a law mee^ely natural, and consequently indispensable, the
which God himself the Author of nature can no more violate, the^ he can de^^e
or hate himself, or be subject to the devil.

Let therefore no man wunder (Gracious sovereign) that both your subjects at
home, and all Catholic Princes, People, and common w^lthes abroad persuaded
themselves, that the said Cathol^ks in our cuntrie should cease to be ^osted
with the furious waves of pers^cution, so soon as they saw your Majesty to be
settled at our stern For this their persuasio^ grew not only of that they had
seen your Graces car^age alwa^es to have been free from al^rigor and seuer^^e;
not for that your royal elemencie always hated the odious and infamous name of
a persecutor, not for that they knew you needed not to maintain your just and
undoubted t^^le by those means, which to your Predecessor seemed necessary
for hers, not for that they thought your Princely wisdom would not exasperate
and dishonor other Christian Princes and People, by perse^uting your subjects,
for being of the same faith and religion with them: not for that diverse your
subjects had reported this your myld disposition and intention in every
fo^re^ne Princes Court and C^^trie, and which very many of them affirmed to
have had it from your Graces self, not for that they held your Majesty for
wise and learned, and that therefore the right of the Catholic cause should be
seriously and maturely examined, before it should be condemned: not for that
they did thinck, that your Royal wisdom would easily see that by persecution
our faith has been no whit diminished, but rather admirably increaced: not for
many other reasons which they deemed would withhould your Grace from so
disgracious, dangerous, hateful, and vng^dly a course: but they were
especially moved unto this honorable and pious conceit of your Majesty, for
that they thought it would never enter into your Princely breast, to arm your
royal hand against the professors of that faith, which all your Majesty's must
honorable Progenitors in England, France, and Scotland ever most zelo^sly and
religiously embraced* since first those Cuntries received their Christianity*
but especially in regard of your Graces most famous and ren^umed Mother, who
(as all the world kn^w^h and to her honor protests) most zelousely protested
the same in her life, and hero^ca^ly sealed this her profession with the
eff^sion of her royal blood at her sacred death. And their godly persuasion was
founded upon this, that they hold this pious precept to be deeply g^auen in
your royal heart: Honora Eccl. 7.
patre tuit* and ge^^^us matris tu^ne obliu^s^aris Honor your Father and
forget not the sobs of your Mother. They thought your Graces dearest mothers
manifold sobs tears, and direful groans in bringing you foort^ into this
world in her restles cares, cogitations, and prayers to God for your
preservation, in the sundry undutiful perilous insu^rections of her own
subjects against her in her most coacted exile and expulsion out of her own
kingdom, in her long rest^a^nt and vn^ust captivity, and finally on the
tragical seaffo^d where the innocent Queen your graces kyndest Parent was
bloudely deprived of her life: they thought (I say) these fo^c^ble groans and
showers of tears of so dear a Mother would not only have inclined her most
beloved Child with all dutiful reverence, but would even naturally that is,
most forcib^y have comp^lled him to respect her, and her cause, that is, the
Catholic cause, for which she sustained these calamities and indignities. And
undoubtedly all the world could not but have ^ustly condemned that person as
very injurious to your Majesty, who ever should have da^ed to have had as much
as a thought that your Highness would eues (I do not say) command, but so much
as permit that the Catholics* your mothers chiefest if not her only friends
should be any ways molested* and much less indamaged, impouerished, in
prisoned, condemned and put to death for the profession of her faith. For the
world has not yet forgouen, neither can the memory thereof ever decay* how
that Catholics have been hampered, fortured, spoiled of their goods, hanged,
boweled and mangled, yea, for^eine nations do still behold the ex^^e and
poverty of diverse, who at this present remain deprived of their lands and
liuelihoods, for having loved, honored, p^^ied, or affectionated the afflicted
innocent mother of King James our redoubted lord Whereby Plu^archu^.
the dutiful behavior of that heathen Roman Cor^olan^s comes into men's
minds, who was so natural as for his mothers s^ke to depose the severe
chast^sment and revenge which he had prepared against those that were so unkind
and ungrateful toward him: by which example they conclude, that your Majesty
being a Christian and the son of a most glorious Christian martyr can not but
grant unto your Catholic subjects, the most ^^lous and sincere friends of you
both, their long desi^ed comfort, and the just f^eedome from their unjust
distresses and oppress^or^s But let others conceive what they ^^st of this old

THE TRANSLATOR TO THE CHRISTIAN Reader.
THERE is a certain foul fault (gentle Reader) for which we Catholics are very
ordinarily and odiously reproched, which is, that we are passing light and
exceedingly prone to believe every fable: and upon this blind simplicity
easily drawn into any superstition and error touching the worship of God. The
reason whereof is held to be our ignorance in the word of God, and the little
sight we have in the holy Bible: rather harkening to the traditions of men (as
is the phrase) and to the voice of the Church, then in marcking what the written
word teaches us. It is very certain that Catholics say with the Royal Ps l.

known to their children that an other generation may know them? The sons
that were to be borne and to rise up after them they shall tell them again to
their children. As our blessed Savior did, when Mat. 16.
sending his Apostles to instruct the world, he bad them preach, that is,
deliver by word of mouth, or tradition his word, but he commanded them not to
write his word. And so from them (upon the tradition of our Elders* we receive
what the Apostles have said or written to be Gods word, although we find no
such declaration for neither their Epistles or Gospels, in the book of his

us, and without understanding our case they blyndely condemn us, and so they
would conclude: that if any point of the Catholic doctrine seem unto them
difficil and strange: it is for that they estraunge themselves from us, and
are altogether unacquainted with our grounds and reasons, and not that we are
so ungrounded and unreasonable, as they imagyn. I could exemplify this in all
the points of our faith, that are in controversy betwixt us and them, if this
present treates and discourse would admit so large a discourse. But because I
know that kind of proceeding will here be thought altogether superfluous:
therefore in brief manner and for a taste I will explicate the state of the
Catholic doctrine touching only such perticulers as concern the matter and
subject of this ensuing relation, which I will show how they stand with the
verdict of God his holy word, and first I will begin with Pilgrimages.

It is a sure and certain verity which the Catholic church always
confesses, that God is in every place: for so he himself has Hierem. 23.
avouched, that he fills both heaven and earth, and therefore there is no
place where in he may not be honored and called upon. Yet, as our lord has
sanctified some particular Exodus 20
days for his service, so has he made choice of some particular places where
in he would The use o^ Pilgrimages ^ oo ^ed by holy scripture.
be particulerly honored For he commanded Abraham to offer his son Isaac
upon one certain determinate hill. Jacob had by vision that the mount Bethel
was a place of extraordinary sanctity, and for that cause he said. Quam
terribilis est locus iste? non est hic aliud nisi domus Genesis 12.
dei, and porta calls. How dread full is this place? this place is nothing else
but the hows of God, and the gate of heaven. Which asseueration of the
Patriarch, our Lord did so much approve, that he took to himself the Gem 31
title of that place saying to the said, Jacob Ego sum Deus Bethel* I am the
God of Bethel. So Hore^ was called the mountain of God, which our Lord
esteemed so holy, that he caused Moses Exodus 3.
his especial servant to put of his shoes in De^t. 12.
honor and reverence thereof. Finally our Lord made choice of one particul^r
place, in which only, he would have his people to offer 3 Reg. 1
sacrifise unto him: where when Solomon had erected his Temple he bese^^hed God
not only to bestow certain particular preuileges and miraculous favors upon
such as prayed there in, and upon such strangers as came from far Cuntries in
pilgrimage thither, but upon all such as should in their prayers turn their
faces toward the holy place, when upon other just impediments they could not
perform their devotions in the holy Temple it self. Which manner of
worshipping God (by pilgrimages) ended not after wards, for that our Savior
foretold the Samaritane that: Ver^es hora quando neque in monte hoc, neque in
Hieros^lymus a dorab^iss Patrem. The hour shall come when I^. 4.
neither in this hyl, nor in Jerusalem You shall adore the Father. Which was
said because the Hebrews were to be expelled out of these places, where by
their sacrifices (meant by the word adoration) should cease, and should not be
tied any longer to one place as they were before, but that his sovereign
worship and adoration should be more frequent, so that no place should be
deprived of the same.

True, Yea most true was that predictio^, that the Father of heaven should
neither be in the former sort adored either in Garizim or in Jerusalem, yet
were it very fond to infer there M 4. 2^.
upon: that he should have no external worship, or churches, or places for the
adminis^tratio^ Luc. 24. Act. 21.
of his divine Sacraments in all the world besides: or that the ancient
laudable use of Pilgrimages should be abrogated for the time to come. For we
read the contrary: how our Lord would have his Apostles go from Jerusalem in
Pilgrimage into Galile, there to see him after his Resurrection. We read that
Act. 20.
he led them out of Jerusalem into Bethania to the mount Oliuet there to be
present at his glorious Ascension. We read that he commanded them to
Hierusal^, there to receive the holy ^hoste. Moreover we read that Saict Paul
made ^lo^g Pilgrimage unto Jerusalem to keep there is Pentecos^ or whitsontyd.
And I dare say that (...) Scripturist can show me by any plain ^cripture
either of Christ or of his Apostles, ^^at the use of devout Pilgrimages were or
^^er should be prohibited to Christians.

Neither does it any whit alter the case in ^^at these Pilgrimages or iourneys
and walks (...) devotion are made to certain places, where the Saints of God
are honored. For as they are not Saints but principally by the mercy
Saints are to be honored.
and grace of God: so what honor is exibited unto them, is in regard that they
are the honorable friends of God, and consequently it I^a. 4^.
has his principal reference to God. Who although he say that he will not give
his honor Ioh. 12.
to any other; yet has he promised to honor his Saints and true servants.
Therefore there is no reason that any man shou^ld be scrupulous Psalm. 13^.
to say and auouche with the Prophet David, Mihi autem ni^^s honorati sunt
a^^^ci tui Deus Thy friends o God are exceedingly honored of me. Neither Genesis
18.
need any fear to adore and worship them, as Abraham and diverse other divine
illuminated Io^ue 5. 4 Reg. 1. 4. Reg. 2.
Saints did his holy Angels and friends. For although Saint Peter would not
permit Cornelius the Centutio^ to adore him, and although the Angel refused
the adoration of Saint John Yet may we not argue that therefore the foresaid
Saints or Angels, or holy devout people Iudi. 13.
did err, sin and offend, either in admitting, or yielding the foresaid
honors and adorations: Act. 10. Apoc. 1^ and 2^.
nor that they consequently (who shall follow their devotions to-wards God his
Saints) are in any sort to be reprehended for the same.

As for the refusal of S. Peter, it is evident, that he would not be adored as
a God, and therefore he told his Caiechumenus, that he was a man. And as for
Saint John I dare be so bold as to thinck, that he was not ^o gross, as to
offer twice to commit Idolatry, or to offer that reverence which was unfitting
for the Angel, or displeasing to Almighty God: for to impute so heinous an
offense unto him, proceeds of too too muddie a conceit, of so high, so wise,
so illuminated a Prophet, Apostle, and the ^e^ ^. Aug: ^. 6 in ^^. 5 Greg Lib
^7. Mo^^l. C ^. 11. and hom ^ in E. ^s^ Bed An el Ruper^. in 19. Apoc.
eagle of all the Evangelists. Understand therefore that in that contention in
humility betwixt those two holy friends, is shrined up a further mystery: and
by the double devotion of this belooued of our Lord, conclude that Angels and
Saints (who as our Savior says shall be in heaven li^e to Angels) may be
worthily honored, worshipped, and adored. Honou^ed, worshipped and adored I s^y,
not with that sovereign honor, worship, and adoration, which is only due to
the supreme Math 22
Majesty of God: but in a far^e inferior manner, according to their
excellency and dignity wherewith God has endued them. For the gifts of God
as being of God, are worthy to be honored and regarded and the persons also
unto whom he co^te^reth them.

I know the modester sort of our contradictors (seeing that we are commanded
to VV^^ honor is due to Saint. Exodus ^ pron 2^. 1. Pet. 2. Leui. 32.
honor our Parents, our Princes, our Elders and betters) will easily grant
that the Saints of God should have their place of honor, as being in greater
height, glory, and dignity about the rest: but to pray unto them, that they
thinck very unmeet and inc^nuenient. Which inconvenience I could never hitherto
see, although I have read diverse things objected whether we may pra^to saints
against such prayers. What? do they thinck that the Saints being now joined
with God, will not pray for us, who so charitably prayed for their friends, and
enemies while they lived in this worldly banishement 2. Much. 15. Apoc 5. and
^. 2. P, ^.
See the contrary practiced by Onim and H^eremie after their deaths:
consider* what the Seniors and the Angel did in the the Apocalips? and note how
Saint Peter promised the same, after his departure out of this life. Is it
that the prayers of Saints are of no value in heaven, which were of that
miraculous efficacy while they lived here on earth? Is it for that God
regards not his Saints when they are once dead? Who told Isa^c after his

them more now that they are with God, then when they lived here amongst mortal
men? Yea, I say whosoever thincketh that the mediation of Christ and of his
Saints for us are of one nature, and condition, is extremely ignorant of the
Catholic doctrine, Hovvour savior is our media ^^r and here ^is Saints.
and of the meaning of holy Scripture touching this point, and consequently
very injurious to the honor and dignity of our blessed Redeemer: Who is not
our mediator by praying for us, as his Saints do, but by his full satisfaction
for our sin, to his fathers Justice, and by the means of his most sacred
death and passion. Is it finally for that God loves us more then his Saints*
knows better then they our necessities? or for that he inuiteth us to come
unto him? and for that it is needles to take a longer way when the shorter is
more speedy and profitable? why the^ should we pray for our selves? or one for
another, being so sinful wretches, and clogged with innumerable imperfections,
and not rather use the assistance of Gods blessed friends, who might offer up
unto him the prayers of our unworthiness, and with their most honorable and
pleasing intercession, grace and succor us before the fearful throne of his
dread Majesty*

By this every one may see, how Catholics in honoring Gods Saints, thereby
more honor God himself: and in praying unto Ps. l. 101
them practice more their humiltie toward him: of whom the Psalmist sings:
Res^e^^^ in oratio^em humilium. Our lord has regarded the prayer of humble
men. And in this forte, I beseech them to understand, VVv Catholics honon^ the
Images of God and his Saints.
(yt so they please) that we Catholics are very far from either iuiurving or
dishonouring God, or his Saints, in that we make and honor their pictures and
images, thereby the more to express, and profess the honor* and reverence we
bear unto our God, and to his happy heavenly friends. We know that those that
sclau^der us for doing these things, can kneel before the Council table, and
stand reverently uncovered before his Majesty's ^haire of estate, without any
fear of treason, or lose Majesty. We blame them not, we thinck they have
reason for this their doing, In the name of God, let them have also a
charitable conceit of Catholics actions, and learn to understand the motives
and grounds thereof. Then shall they see that we make no more of an image, then
of an image: which is, a representation of the thing or person, whose image it
is: and when we honor it, we honor either at the sight thereof the person of
honor whom it represents, or we honor it for that it is an honorable
representation of such an honorable personage. And when we reueretly kneeling
pray before it, we offer our prayers to that person in heaven, whose presence
by the picture is the more settled and imprinted in our minds. There is scarce
any man so barbarous ^o be found, but takes pleasure to see the images of his
Prince, Pare^tes, and friends to be regarded and used honorably for their
sakes: as on the contrary it much molesteth and griueth them, to see them
disgraced, stabd, or trodden under foot in demonstration Stow in his An ^^les.

of the hatred that is borne to the persons whose images they are. Yea such
actions seem to offend them as much, (if not more) as any injurious and
contumelious words v^tered against them. Our Contrie afoordeth us herein a
most memorable example, to wit in the araigneme^t of that pha^atical wretch
william Hacket who although he had most blasphemously termed him-self Jesus
Christ: Yet (as John Stow writes was he by two indi^eme^tes found guilty, and
acordingly condemned and executed, for having spoken diverse most falce and
traitorous words against her Majesty, (he says nothing out of the said
iditem^ts of his most detestable blasphemy and treason against God) and for
having razed and defaced her Majesty's arms, as also a certain picture of the
Queens Majesty, and did malicio sly, and traiterousely thrust an iron
instrument into that part of the said picture, that did represe^t the breast
and heart of the Queens Majesty. Which things seemed so heyuous, that the
judges thought it more meet to condemn and execute him as a traitor to the
Prince, then as an abominable accursed violatour of the most sovereign
Majesty of the high king of heaven. And so he was. Whereby it appears how
they thought her Majesty iniuried and disgraced, by the injury and disgrace
which the said caiti offered unto her arms and image Upon which consideration
I would ask, what punishment they have merited, that have so dispitefuly and
barbarously thrown down ma^gled and tro^den under their accursed sinful feet
the Pictures of God himself, and of his blessed Mother, and of his holy
Saints? which outrage they committed, to show themselves Why Catholics let
up the Images of God and his ^^^^ ctes.
contrary to the Catholics: Who, as for the love, honor, and devout memory
of God and his holy ones they set up their Images in their Churches, Oratories,
and other honorable places of their Cities and Cuntries: so these people being
desirous to manifest the opposition of their minds, to the intentions of the
Catholics, and to show how they detested their meaning, they pulled them down,
and by diverse infamous base dishonorable ways consumed them, that thereby the
world might see their hatred toward God, their contempt of his di^ine
Majesty, and how they desired to raze out of the memories of men whatsoever by
holy pictures were represented unto them: Neither can they excuse this their
impiety, by their old spu^galled allegations of the twentieth of Exodus by the
fifth of the first of S. John, and such like places, by themselves falcely and
with most vngo^ly iniquity corrupted. Putting into the text Images for Idols,
as though they nothing differed. Which interpretation if we should ad^it, then,
who soever retains the kings picture or arms, or the cross of Christ in

cognizance, is made culpable of a most h^inous ^inne against God, and is made
guilty of eternal damnation. Yet can their Fox set them out the pictures of his
Martyrs, and his people may gaze upon them. The images of vv^lef, Luther, Hus,
Mela^^thon, Calvin, and of such Apostata condemned companions may be painted,
sold, and hanged up in every ones hows to be tooted upon. Yea in dishonor of
the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, Monks, and Nuns many ridiculous
shapes may be devised to recreate and make merry our gospelling brethren and
sisters, without any peril of Idolatry, or breach of Gods commandments,
although their Minister cry to them from the communion table, that thou shall
not make to thy self any graven image, nor any likeness of that which is in
heaven above, nor in the earth beneath, nor in the waters under the earth. Yet
one sort of images they can allow to be made to them*selues, which they will
buy, set up in their rooms and dece^t places of their howses, and there
gravely glote upon them, because they thinck the persons there pointed, to be
^ightes of the gospel, chosen trumpettes of the truth great frende^ of the
lord, and what not? The other sort they can divise, which will also be sold,
and bought, to iybe and scoff at, and that in contempt of the Praelates, and
principal members of the Catholic Church, whom they hate and despise with
their hearts. In both these kinds of pictures they can fyn^ a relation either
in good or bad manner to the persons whom they represent, but the pictures of
Christ and of his holy Saints, must needs be Idols: they can represent
nothing that is good, or 1. Cor 2.
worthy veneration. So it is that Any malis homo non percipit ea quae sunt
spiritus Dei. The sensual man perce^ueth not those thing: that are of the
Spirit of God. For if those people were in deed so spiritual, as they are often
ver^e prec^^e forsooth (...) their words, they would easily ^iscerue an Idol
from an Image. For i^ they will daigne to view what is set before the first
commandment, and what insueth, they shall find that our Lord begins with: I
am thy lord thy God and, Afterward, Exo. 20.
Thou shall have no strage God^ before m^. And after that: Thou shall not make
to thy self ^^y car^ing and And then adds: Thou shall not adore thein or
worship them: I am the lord t^y strong God etc. Where they may see, that he
forbids to make unto themselves carved Gods, which are Idols. For he is the
lord God. And that they should not yield divine adoration and worship unto
them: which is Idolatry. Exodus 25
For he says, I am the lord thy strong God. Else Moys^s, and Solomon and God

him-self for that Genesis 9.
he will have man to be respected because he is his image. And therefore he
threatens to pu^nish those persons most severely* that shall unjustly shed the
blood of Man, for that he is the image of God: as if thereby he would forbid
men to abuse, break, and consume his image: and here upon conclude, the image
of God is good, therefore it may be had, therefore it may be honored for his
sake.

The reason of which doctrine (if thou mark The ground and reason of al these
points.
well courteous reader) consists in these poincts? First, to worship and honor
God for himself, as being the Fountain of all goodness: then his saints, for
that he has imparted and derived unto them the abundance of his unspeakable
graces and glory: and so the images of them both are to be worshipped as their
representations, and for that they notably apertaine unto them: and thus
consequently Catholics do very well if for the honor of God and of his Saints,
they discreetely and orderly love, and reverence any thing that concerns
them. Which honor and reverence as they may profess with their mouths, or by
their words, so may they manifest the same accordingly and in the same degree,
by their outward gestures and actions. For which cause they are much to be
blamed who blame the devotions of Catholics, for honoring the Relics of
Saints, or such things as belong unto them, or to their very images. As we see
the good devout Catholics here, for the honor they bear to God, to worship
his worthy Mother and for her worship, they reverence her Image: and for the
reverence of her Image, they bear also a reverent esteem of the very wood of
the tree wherein the said Image was placed. Acording to that which is recorded
in Exodus: where the ^xod. ^.
Angel that apeared for God to Moses in the fiery bush, was for that cause
honored with the title of God: and for the said Angel his more reverence,
Moses was prohibited to aproach near unto the bush wherein he appeered: and in
regard of the bush, the very mountain where it grew was accounted so holy,
that Moses must put of his shoes, and walk upon it barefoot for the honor
there of. And at other times, our lord would so honor the cloak of E^^as, the
dead corpse of Elize^s, the 4 Reg. ^ 4 Reg 1^ Act 5. Act. 1^.
shadow of the body of Saint Peter, the napkins of Saint Paul, and the like
of other saints, that at their presence or bare touching he would woork most
admirable miracles, and bestow most gracious benefits upon his people, because
the* said things did belong unto his honorable Saints,

And this may suffice in brief to declare by holy Scripture, the reason of the
Catholic Churches says and practice, in these matters, where-in the ignorant
of the Catholic doctrine, or such as by the ignorance or malice of others are
ill persuaded thereof, may be offended, in rea^ing this ensuing treates. As
for other things (which also unto them may seem strange) they shall (if they
please to inquire) find them so plain and evident in the word of God, as none
but they that are altogether ignorant of the word of God, or believe not the
Scriptures can have any scrupule therein. As, how grateful a thing it is to God
discreetely and devoutly to ma^e vows unto him, and for his honor to offer
unto him (for the beautifiing of such places where he will be honored) part,
of their wordly wealth, ^ew else or such things as by the^ are held in price.

For the first, we have the counsel of the Royal Prophet saying: Ven^^^. and
reddite Dommo To make holy and discrete vo^re^is is very acceptable to God.
Psalm. 7 ^.
Deo vestro: omnes qui in circu^^^ e^us affertis munera. Make (...) and fulfill
them to your Lord God: all you that round about ^^^ bring him your presents And
upon the assurednes of this doctrine the same Prophet said. Vota ^^^ roddam
(...) consp^ctu ^menti^^^ cum: I v^il render my v^vves in the sight of such as
fear^ our lord.

And for the second: we read how Moses by the commandment of God persuaded
his The o^ferings of the faithful are much pleasing to God. Exodus 35 36. Math.

Israelites, to show their liberallitie in adorning of the Tabernacle. Wherein
they were so zealous and forward, that Moses was constrained to restrain them
by express commandment and sound of trumpet. And although some with the
son of Isc^r^^t cry out. Vt quid perditio haec? what a l^sse is this, for
it v^ere better to give it to the poor. Yet the devout Christian shall have
Christ to bear him out, for pouring with the devout Magdolen his precious
oils upon his sacred head, and for making moderate and discreet largess of
his temporal goods acording to his ability, in honorably setting forth the
worship and places of worship of his God.

I do not think (loving Reader) but many oppositions will be made both against
these things which I have here said, as also against sundry other matters
which are contained in the history following: for we have to deal with an
incredulous, proud, contradicting generation. Thou may well judge that al can
not here be said, that may be said. Wherefore I assure thee, that if thou wilt
but manifest thy difficulties to those that are learned and instructed in the
grounds of the Catholyk Religion, thou shall find full and perfect satisfacton,
and thou shall evidently see, that what soever is objected against these
matters, are but either mere doubts, or strained: ^^^ations, or f^lce and
frivolous collections, or vacharitable railing or their own forged inventions,
or lying headles reports, or uncivil and ungodly sco^fing and jesting, or such
like tru^^perie.

Be thou therefore fully persuaded of this poinct: that as God is the truth it
self, and as the devil is the father and author of lies, so God will not have
his cause defended and maintained, but by the only truth, and he detesteth
whatsoever is taken out of his enemies shop. As God and the devil can never
The cause of God vvil no^ be suppor ted by lye^.
agree, so truth and lies can never conforte together, and it is either great
ignorance or impietic to thinck, that Gods cause either is, or ever can be
driven to so hard an ex^gent, that it must be supported and held up by such
broken stuff. True it is, a ly may go masked under such a veil that it may be
taken for truth, by such as are not curious to note and marck the car^age
thereof: but the nature of man being always amourous of the tru^he, and
ielous that fal^hood should fo^ste her-self into the place of truth, the wiser
forte are more dain^ie and nice to admit any thing, until upon serious
examination they have looked more diligently into matters: Where upon it
happens, that time and diligence trying truth, falsehood is ferrited out to
her more detestation, her authors greater shame, and the future safeguard of
those that were in peril to have been gulled by her. So that upon this
consideration thou may confidently conclude, that if the Catholyk Religion
were backed and bolstred up by such bad dealing, (as all here^ikes lowdly but
more lewdly au^uche) it Note this evident expe^^^ce.
had been ruined long ere this. But we experience the contrary to our comfort
and astonishment: that so many heretics having risen in all the quarters and
cuntries of the world, who by open lying, cunning conueiance of tongue, and
tyrannical force, omitting nothing, that might overthrow either all, or the
greatest part of our holy belief: although they have wrested many notable
parts of Europe out of the arms and bosom, of our deer Mother the Catholyke
Church, yet has she regained treble (at least) her loss in the Indiaes: and
the points also which they have so long battred at, have been the more
learnedly, perspicuously and heroically defended, more ^eruently embraced, and
more zelously practiced, then perhaps they ever were in former ages. And so it
comes to pass, that we see now Sacramental Confession more used, the holy
M^sse more frequented, the blessed Sacrement more honored, Relics of
Saints and their Images more reverenced, Pilgrimages more haunted, the Popes
pardons more desired, Religious Congregations in greater number and better
order, the Churches precepts more obeyed, yea and the Pope (against whom al
Heretics chiefly shoot) more respected and reverenced, and his dignity power
and prerogatives more confessed by Kings, Princes, Praeiates, the learned and
common sort of all kingdoms, and nations then ever before. While the heretics
who at the beginning were but in few sects, are now almost in every kingdom
and common wealth where they are permitted* rent and torn in to so many
different synagogues, fa^thes, and professions, each one writing, wra^g^ing,
railing and raging against other, and according to their power, one faction
corporally punnishing and plaging the other, that as we perce^ue their s^ctes
daily to increace, so w^ see the professors of each sect to decrease, and either
to return again to the Catholic Church, or to s^r abroache new doctrines of
their own, or finally to care for no Faith, no Church, no Religion, and no
God at all.

And thus we see the old saying prove true that a^heisme is the natural impe
of heresy. For men having entered thereby in^o a wrangling, contradi^^ious,
proud, selflyking, froward, and ^istrusting humor: they will yield to nothing if
they ca^ any way shift it of: whereby not only faith in matters that are
supernatu^al and surpassing our understanding, but even humane or common
credence, sense and judgment, is as it were wholly extinguished, and amongst
men daily more and more decays. W^o knows no^ that as too has^ie creduli^^e
proceeds o^ simplicity and weakness of w^^^, so that it is a sign of a
wicked vicious mind ^o be too difficile and res^ie in believing: for such
persons being either suspicious of other men's honesty and fidelity, or
knowi^g how prove they themselves are to deceive and circumuent others to their
power, they are very hardly induced to trust any. The mean therefore is to be
chosen, which is there to submitt our selves where reason and sufficient
authority may seem justly to exact it of us. A^ (to exemplify in the present
matter of these miracles here related) what greater reason should move a
reasonable man then to see so many and such wounderful miracles daily to be
wrought in things appe^taining to matters of faith and religion? Whereby, not
only the people of the cuntrie, but strangers of foreign nations, not only
persons of the common sort but the most praecellent in dignity and nobility,
not only those of the ordinary and common intendement, but the most lea^ned
and instructed in all kind of literature and knowledge, not only private
howsholds and families, but the very Magistrates and Communities of Cities and
Provinces are driven into unspeakable admiration and astonishment. Who after
all the diligent search exami^ation and inquisition which either by wit,
industry, learning, authority, and conscience they were able to use, they
could never hitherto find the least suspicion of any fraud or iniquity: but
rather they are forted to confess the miraculous finger of God in each thing,
whereby it pleases him in such admirable sort to honor his mo^^e sacred
Mother, to comfort his grieved and afflicted children, to animate the more
faithful, to co^fi^m the feeble wauerers, and to reduce those that are in error
under the government and due obedience of the true pastors of their souls.

When Jesus in the field of Jericho beheld the Iosue 5.
Angel of God with his naked sword in his hand, who declared unto him that he
was the Prince of the army of our Lord, undoubtedly he was exceedingly glad of
that vision, to see that he, and his army had such a guyd, and protector from
heaven. As it is also reported of the people of God, that they were singulerly
comforted and encouraged to fight against their enemies, after they had hard

with these words. Take the holy svvord a gift sent thee from God* in which
thou shall abase and bring under the adversaries of my people of Israel. In
like manner what Catholics are their, who amiddest so many adversaries of
their faith and religion, stand environed and are on every side battred with
sclaunders and calumniations, both against their faith and persons, impouer
shed by the loss of their goods, disgraced by deprivation of their dignities,
restrained by imprisonments, tossed by ielouses, inquiries and searches,
consumed with inward and outward torments and most barbarous cruel bloody
deaths; what Catholics are there (I say) who seeing the hand of God stretched
out by heavenly fignes to approve and honor the cause of these their
sufferings, but must needs feel in themselves an unspeakable joy and
iubilation, and to be thereby exceedingly inflamed to maintain and confess a
cause, from heaven so mightily and powrably defended, not by the sword and
presence only of an Angel, not only by the intercessions of an ^^^^t or of a
Hieremie, but by the favorable a(...)e of the high Queen of Angels, prophets,
and Saints the most blessed Mother of our God Christ Jesus? where, we behold
not by the relation of others, but immediately by our selves, not in a dream or
obscu^e vision, but with our corporal eyes, not only one gold sword, but so
many works of heavenly power, as so many swords to hew do un al such
adversaries as band them selves against God and his holy Catholic Church.
Which is a matter of that consequence, that i^ our adversaries either by any of
their Ministry, or by any rite of their religion could have cured in this
sort but one lame dog it should have rung far and near, and wounder^ul
trophese should have been raised in memory thereof.

Marck therefore (Catholic brother) and with due gratitude behold how liberal
God has been to thee in these things, thereby to solace thee in the throng of
so many miseries and contrarieu^s. Whilst the ungodly ^ri^d upon the Princes
and Parlaments against poor Catholics: Exina^ite Exin^^ite vsque ad fundament^^

no memory may remain of them. Not-withstanding behold (O Catholic) Psalm. 44.

confirm thee, with heir deaths and blood spilt to encourage thee, and to gain
others. (even of thine adversaries) to confess and embrace the same faith with
thee. Is this to see how natural effects follow their natural causes? how
^clauders defame, authority disgraceth, laws restrain, wealth works, force
keeps down, poverty deiect^th, torments ^errific, and death consumes? No,
but rather thou may see the old admirable signs renewed again amongst us.

What can the derider contradictor or persecutor of our Catholic faith cau^l
against these? what more clear evidence can he require from heaven then these?
would he have the dread Majesty of God to descend and sit in the clouds, and
thence to command him submission and reverence unto these things? Verily he
shall see our lord descend according as the Prophet Zachary has fore told

assoorded thee, whereby thou may also perceive how deerly he loves thee and
tendreth thy salvation, although he has no need of thee. Show thy self
therefore grateful for this his grace, that after this life he may make thee
also pertaker of his eternal glory: for which first he created thee, and
afterward most mercifully redeemed thee, and unto which now by these his
divine works he most lovingly inuiteth thee.

THE PREFACE OF THE AVTHOR.
We give thee here (loving Reader) a brief rebearsal of such things as
concern the place of Montaigue nere ^o the town of Siche^ in the Duchy of
Braba^t: We have also set down the miracles which have ^apned there of late,
by the merits and inter^ession of the glorious virgin Marie, Yet not all, but
only those that are proved and veri^^ed by pu^like wrytings and attestations
of Magistrates, and other authentical declarations: as well to prevent thereby
the slanders of h^ret^kes, as also for the better information and satisfaction
of good Catholics. As for the he e^^kes, they have all ^ayes had an ancient
custom with great vehemencie^ to calu^^^ate and blame those things in the
Catholic Roman Church, which they in their synagogs li^t not to believe. And
before the^ the Pharisees used the like, who ascribed the miracles of our
Savior and his disciples to the power of the Devil. This all sectaries that
have been since the beginning in the Church have always imitated, and the
beret^kes of our days do still very markablie practice, who began their
heresies by uttering blasphemses against the Moother of God and his Satnctes.
And pullskly not only in their talk, but also in their writings, bragging
themselves to be Image-breakers.

A certain pamphlet in flemmish came of late to our hands printed and
composed (as it seems) by seem pernicious Caluinist of Holland against the
honor done to the Moother of God at Mountaigue. In which pamphlet he writes
execrable blasphemies, he forgeth fables and lies against those of the Church,
he basely scosseth at the pi^tie of Princes and Lords of the Country, and at
all such as love and serve the glorious virgin And sinallie he endeuereth by
lies to deface and obscure the honor done to God and his blessed Mother.
Howbeit this companion and all such like night-o^les will they will they, must
needs endure the most clear light which e^r lord makes daily to ^lase before
our eyes, to his own and his Moothers glory: and through the evidence of
these miracles, they must ly trodden under the feet of this woman, together
with the old serpent their head and captain.

And in vain shall their labor be that endeavor to hinder the Sun to give
his light unto the earth, the will of our Lord being such as the truth shall
clerelie be seen, and pterce through the most obscure and duskie clouds of
heresies, Far more proffitable therefore and wholesome would it be for them to
open the windows of their hearts and to let these divine beams enter in. And
what beams can be more clear or of more force, then these so palpable
arguments and evident demonstrations of the pure and sincere verity. Do not
these (I beseech you) so apparent miracles cry out the very same that our
Savior speaks in the ghospel? If you believe not me, believe the woorks
which I do. And that which the Parents of the blind man said. Enquire of him,
he is of age, he will answer for him-self, he is thirty years old.

These corrupters of the truth think to abuse the simple people, telling them
that Catholics woorship Idols, and that they honor the virgin Marie as if she
were a goddess, and adore Images: but this is an old song so often by them
chaunted, so often disputed, and in such sort refuted as there is no Catholic
of so sie^der indgemen^ who knows not the blessed virgin to be honored as a
Patroness and Advocate to her Son and not as a Goddess, and that the honor
done to her Image has relation to her person and not to ber Image. And
m^r^o^er that all manner of adoration whether it be Latria, Dulia, or
Hyperdulia must not be taken or understood according to the outward woork and
appearance but according to the intention of the party from whom it proceeds.

After an other sort this may in like manner be proffitable to Catholics. for
so much as there are some amongst them who seem to doubt of these miracles, for
diuersmen by a certain kind of incredulitte, and others upon a spirit of
contradiction either deny that these are miracles, or they will not believe,
that they have verily been wrought. Unto these we must say that which our
Savior said unto Saint Thomas. Come and feel etc. If they will not yield
credit to that which we set down, let them go and see, and feel with their
fingers, or else enquire the verity of those who have been cured, for I am
assured they shall find good store of them. And if after this they will not yet
believe, assure your selves (as Aristotle said of those that denied the
principles of sciences) that they do it for want of wit and judgment, or else
it must be beaten into their brains with beetles or bastinadoes.

There are also others who take occasion to doubt hereof, because many having
been miraculously cured, did not for all that obtain their health at an
instant, or at the very place, but by little and little with some alteration of
their bodies: unto whom we may by good reason answer, that to prove a
miracle it suffiseth that the operation and effect be above the course of
nature, and not by any natural means or remedies: and such are all those
miracles which here in this history we have set down.

Moreover amongst these miracles some are more perfect and notable then some
others are: amongst the more notable are esteemed those, when the diseases are
cured at the very same instant, whereof we have very many, and yet the
others are not without miracle, although they have happened in success of time,
because they were wrought above the course of nature.

For who is he that will or can deny that when our Lord cured the blind man it
was a true and perfect miracle? who at the beginning saw men walk like trees,
yet no man doubts that he afterward received his perfect sight.

Neither is it any ways repugnant to the nature of a miracle that at the time
of their healing they feel a change or alteration either in their souls or in
their bodies: for (not alleging the other reasons which we will set down in
the ensuing history) who is he that knows of those whom our Lord and his
saints miraculously cured did not feel the like also in them selves? No author
nor writer denies or affirms that they were restored to their health without
such alterations. And for so much as those miracles were wrought principalli^
for the confirmation of our faith, it suffi^ed only to set down the bare truth
without further expressing the circumstances, or what other things else therein
occurred. Our Lord recounted his miracles to the disciples of S. John Baptist
(who doubted whether he were the true Messiah or no) without making any mention
of the circumstance* or other qualities, saying: Go, tell unto John. The blind
see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the leprous are made clean, giving us
thereby to understand that such cures (although he had said nothing) yielded
certain and infallible proof that he was the true Messiah. And when we hear,
see, and feel the like to be done by the merits and intercession of the
glorious mother of God at the Mountain of Mountaigue, who is he that is so
wilfully blind as will not acknowledge the holy Catholic Roman Church adorned
and honored with such signs and miracles, to be the only spouse of Christ, the
dove and beloved of our Lord, the fortress and pillar of truth, in whoms
only true and perfect miracles are to be found?

Awake therefore (O you misledde ^ith heresies) open the eyes of your
understanding, and behold the light wherewith the God of mercies vou^^safeth to
lighten the darkness of your iniquities and ignorances. If he had not publikly
wrought these signs and miracles that none but he is able to woork, perhaps
this misguided people might in some sort be excused: but seeing they have had
so great and manifest signs and testimonies, they shall be inexcusable in that
they do not woork their own conuersions.

And you faithful Catholics who for the prosperity of our enemies, or evil
success of the affairs of our religion, or for the abuses and imperfection in
the life and ma^ners of those of the Church or layetie, are wont to stagger or
be faint-harted, confirm and settle your selves hereby: you are in S. Peeters
ship, wherein (not withstanding all waves and tempests) it pleases our lord to
woork his miracles.

And all you that by the miracles and interces^ion of the glorious virgin Marie
most holy Moother of God, have re^eiued health or help, forbear not to
manifest the same to your superiors and others (since it is much honorable to
reveal the works of God) whom we exhort in our Lord that they give
advertisement thereof to the right Reverend the lord Archbishop of Maclin,
VVherby the name of God may be sanctified amongst us, and that his mercy may
be exalted and magnified in his Sai^cts. For how many so^u^r his miracles a^e,
so many exhortatio^s and sermons they be, and which more forciblie mo^e the
hearts of men then the sermons of any ^e ^e never so excellent for his knowledge
or elequence. And for our part let us endeavor to give everlasting praise to the
mercy of God, who in this our miserable and afflicted state (as for the
present is this of the low Countries) he vouchsafes to send us comfort by
woorking so great and goodly works, yea such as we think in that country
never happened the like.

Lt us also praise the moother of God, and let us so beg her protection as
she rising once like an amiable Aurora, will disperse the dark obscurity of
our miseries, and as a most bright and fair Moon, will vouchsafe to yield
light to those which ly in the dark night of errors and heresies, and as a
clear shyning Sun would pearce with the beams of grace and virtue the
hearts of the faithful people, which have the fear of God: and finally like a
well ^arshalled battle drive all the heresies out of the woorld: and by her
holy protection defend these low Countries from all corporal and spiritual
in^^sions: by the power of him who does her such honor both in heaven and in
earth*

Amen.
THE HISTORY OF THE MIRACLES WROVGHT BY THE INTERCESSION OF OUR blessed Lady,
at a place called Mountaigue, in the duchy of Brabant.
THE holy scripture makes mention of an Oak behynd the town of S^chem in
Palestine under the which Jacob buried the Idols and the Jewels that hanged at
the ears of his people. And at the same Oak the Captain Iosue renewed the
covenant betwixt God and the people of Israel. Very fitly ought we to set
forth the renowned fame of the Oak which stands nere to our Sic^en in the
Duchy of Brabant, at the which Oak in a place vulgarly called Scherpenheuuel
and in French Mountaigue before an Image of the Mother of God being very
simple and of little show (as the place it self is) it pleases his divine
majesty to woork daily many miracles, by the glory whereof it seems that
his desire and pleasure is that the heretics being curbed, and the Catholics
made more submissiue the pride of heretics and the idolles of other vices
might here ly buried: and that in this place he will be appeased by the prayers
of good and godly Christians: and that he will renew his friendship and
alliance with the people of these low Countries, for we esteem the glory of
miracles to be accounted one of the most assured notes and marks of the true
Church, grounded upon the words of our Savior in the gospel saying: Such
signs shall follow Marc. 16 Heb^. 2.
those that believe in me. They shall lay their hands upon the diseased and
they shall be healed, etc. And the holy Apostle says that unto the preaching
and teaching of the way of salvation, our Lord added a testimony of his own
hand by signs, miracles, and other supernatural works of his power. For even
as the miracles of our Lord served for proofs to make me^ believe that he was
the true Savior of the world according to that which he says in the gospel,
even so the true and undoubted miracles which cannot be wrought without the
puissance of God, yield testimony to his body, which is his holy Church. For
which cause that most learned De vtilit^te credendi cap. 17. eodem lib. cap. 1^
and co^ tra op. funda. cap. 4.
Doctor S. Austin says, that the Catholic Church obtained sovereign
authority, when heretics were judged and condemned by the majesty of
miracles. And in an other place, that the authority of the Church began by
miracles, and by the same she mainteyneth her force. And again, the concord
and union of all nations (says he) together with the authority of miracles,
holds me in the holy Church. And Richard de S. Victore durst co^fide^tlie
lib. 1. de T^init^te cap. 2.
say, Lord if this be erroneous which we believe, it is by thyself that we
are deceived, for these things were established and confirmed amongst us with
such signs and miracles as none but thou were able to woork.

Amongst these miracles they are not the least which his divine goodness
vouchsafed to woork even from the beginning of the Christian common wealth, in
diverse places at the Images and for the honor and woorship of the Mother of God.

It is an undoubted ancient tradition that S. Luke painted an Image of our
Lady, ^^e which we have by the testimony of diverse credible writers and
authors, as of Theodorus, Nicephorus, Metaphr^sies, But lib. 14. in vita S.
Luce.
whether he painted more then one we are not assured, yet this is certain,
that many Images were drawn according to that which he had first painted, and
were afterward sent to diverse places, neither ought it to be deemed
impertinent that some have attributed them to S. Luke, for so much as they were
perfect draughtes and resemblances of the original first painted by his own
hand. Of which Images that was one, which S. Gregory the first carried A^^^*
S^^^^: lib de (...) ^^^^ Eccle Baron in Annal.
in solemn procession in Rome, whereby the great infection of the plague
ceased, where with the air was corrupted, in the year of our lord 509. And
all the people of Rome are of opinion that it is the same Image which is now
kept in the Church of S. Maria Mayor. Such also was ^aspar var^e^ius in
cho^ogr^ Hisp.
that, which (as they say) the said S. Gregory sent to S. Leander Bishop of
S^^^l in Spain, the which the Spaniardes honor and now call by the name of
Nu^st^^ Sen^ora de Guadalupe.

The Image that sometime was honored in the City of Constantinople, (and in
regard of the devotion used thereunto, the Mother of God now and then delivered
her servants from the hands of the Sarasins) is held by some to be that which
the Empress ^^loxia sent to Pul^^er^^ from Iherusalem to Constantinople, the
which authors Sigo^ius in Hist. Ital.
of good credit write, was afterward translated to Ven^^e where at this
present it remains. Alphonsus de Vilegas in his book entitled ^^los
Sanitorum testifies Antonie Ben^^^ in ^^^^ico (...) Francis. A^^as lib de
i^^^. virg cap 20.
by the authority of very many learned men, that at this present there is in
the City of Saragosa in Spain a Chapel built and an Image of our lady there
placed by the hands of S. James the Apostle, and honored with many miracles,
which the Spainardes call Nuesira Sen^ra del p^lar. Nauarrus reherseth by the
testimony of Osortus that in the City of Calicut in the Indies there is yet to
be seen an Image of our Lady with her Child in her arms, the which they hold
was there left by one of the three kings, or by some principal person of
their train, who was at the adoring of our Lord in Bethleem.

They who have left us written the history and particularities of that
puissant kingdom of China lying in the uttermost Joan Co^^^^^^ de M^^^^^^.
bounds of the east, assure us that they found in the City of Ch^nce^ a
marvelous sumptuous temple, where the Inhabitants of the Country being Pagans,
had placed in a Chapel a hundredth and eleven Idols, and besides them three
very rich statues* whereof the one had one body and three faces, beholding each
the other very attentively, the other was of a woman bearing a Child in her
arms: the third of a man apparailed in such sort as the Christians paint the
holy Apostles, so that it seems the Image of the virgin Marie was there
known and had in honor.

The admirable and renowned history of our Lady of Laureto is famous ^^o^^t.
Tursel^^us hist. ^di^ Lauret.
over all the world, wherein we may see how our Lord has made choice of four
diverse places whereunto he caused that holy house wherein the divine incarnation
was wrought, to be translated by the ministry of Angels, whereof the fourth
place is that of Lauretto, where now it continues in the Marca of Ancona*
where it is very much frequented through the innumerable visitations of all
sorts of Pilgrims, and for the multitude of miracles which are seen there to
happen daily. In the Chappelle of that place is an Image of our Lady with her
babe Jesus, devoutly carved out of Cedar wood. Also the pilgrimage to the
church F^^eol M^ri^n p* g. 106
at Mont-Serato in the kingdom of Cathalognia in Spain is very renowned,
where the Image of the Mother of god is greatly honored, which was there
miraculouslie found within a cave, about the year of our Lord. 890. where by
the intercession of our blessed Lady have been wrought many assured miracles
amply set down, in a history co^piled therofand Anno 1601.
translated into french, and not long sithence dedicated to the french king now
reigning.

THE SECOND CHAPTER.
AND to the end we occupy not our selves in foreign matters only. These low
Countries have in semblable manner (and that in many places) the memories of
the glorious Vergin Marie honored with diverse miracles: And to begin with
Henault: Tongre, a village hard by the Town of Ath has an Image of our Lady,
the which in the year 1081. was three times placed there, and notwithstanding
that it was diverse times carried to other places, yet was it still mirac^louslie
brought thither back again.

In the Abbay of Cambron (which is of the Cistertian order) is kept a certain
Image of the Mother of God, painted upon a wall, the which in the year 1^32
being wounded with a bore-speare by a Jew, yielded great abundance of blood,
the marks whereof are to be seen to this present day. We read the like to
have happened even in our days in the year 1595 in the Duchy of Sauoy nere to
a town called Mo^ntaruie, where there was an Image of our lady, which having
received certain gashes with a sword of a Caluinist, yielded incontinently
blood, wherewith many blind, deaf, lame, and other diseased were cured.

In like manner our Lord has wrought many marvelous things by the invocation
of his holy Mother in a little town of Henault called Chieure, since the year
of our lord 1326. the which also continues even to our days.

And in special sort in the same province the said blessed virgin is much
honored in the town of Hall where is an Image of her, placed by S. Elizabeth
daughter to the king of Hungary, singular devotion being there used in regard
of the miracles which are see^ there to happen unto those who either go thither
in pilgrimage or else vow to go. Whereof the great lear ned I. Lipsius has of
late composed a book.

In the Country of Art^o^s and in the City of A^ras is a wax taper brought
Joan Molan. not. S^. ^elg 6. ^ebr.
thither miraculouslie by the Mother of God in the year of our lord 1105 in
the time of Lambert Bishop of Arras. And this was done to heal a disease
called the fyri-burning. This Candle is kept with great care in the foresaid
City and is used very souerainlie for the curing of many maladies: never
consuming although Ioannes Mo^ us in pt^^: spirit.
it be often times lighted; and that they have made many little candels of the
drops of the wax that have been powered from the same: not unlike unto that
candle of John the Heremit dwelling in S^chus near to Jerusalem, the which he
had in his cave burning before an image of our lady, and which he was wont to
recomend to the Mother of God, to the end she would still keep it burning for
her honor, so often as at any time he went to any place thence in pilgrimage.
And although he was sometimes from home. for the space of two, three, yea of
six months together, yet he always found it at his return whole and clearly
burning as before he left it. Lykwise many great works and liberal gifts of
God are seen to proceed from him, in the duchy of Braba^t, by the intercession
of the glorious virgin his mother.

At Laken nere to the city of Bruxels a fair Church has been built, to the
honor of our Lady, wherein (as it is well known to the world) many have
received help and remedy from the hand of God. So as the woorthines of this
place confirms sufficiently the ancient tradition, that the first model or
pattern of the said Church was set down by our Lady herself and honored with
her visible presence.

In the City of Bruxell^s in a Chapel of our Lady call ed the Sablon an Image
Antiqu. M^S ex b^b^^^ ^^^b^aeh v^lli^.
of her was there set in the year of our Lord 1348. by a very devout woman
called B^^iue S^etkens, the which Image is thought to have been pa^nted by
miracle, and in this place many miracles were wrought until the year 1580.

In certa^ne old written book^s in the Collegial Church of S. Peter's in
Louaeine are conta^ned ^undrie miracles which have in times past happened before
an Image of our Lady which is yet there, and these have continued since the
year 1442. even unto out time.

In Viluord, in a Cloister called of co^foit where the Rel g^euse women of the
Carm^litan order dwell, is an Image of our lady the which Dame Sophia wife to
duke Henry the second of B^aba^t received from her mother S. Fliza et*
Countess of He^sen, which she left there for the comfort of certain o^d
Matrons that then ly^ed in a congregation in that place, whereupon it has still
retained that name.

It is not needful to recount here the miracles which our Lord woorketh day lie
by the invocation of his blessed mother in the Church of our lady of Hanswick
at Ma^klin, Alsembe^g and Sc^ute nere Bruxelles, at Led by the town of Alost,
at Hasselare by A^denard in Flaundres, at the Chapel of our lady in the
market place of S. Omers in Arthois, at the Chapel of our lady of grace nere
to the City of Lile, And it is thought that there is no one province in these
low Countries, which has not, or had not, some place dedicated to the Mother
of God, wherein his divine bounty has not wrought or yet woorketh not
sometimes miracles, where of there are both particular and public
testifications in great number.

THE THIRD CHAPTER.
BUT amongst all, that is very wounderful which we see and hear to happen
daily at the place of Mountaigue nere to the town of Siche^, in the Duchy of
Brabant, being of such importance and admiration that through the fame thereof
within the space of six or seaue^ mo^thes many thousands of Pilgrims from all
parts have resorted thither. And to the end that in a matter so lately known
and in such abundance of miracles amongst the brute of so-many incertainties,
the truth may perfitly be seen, we have resolved to make here a particular
and faithful rehersall of such things as hitherto have come to our knowledge,
as well concerning the p^ace and the Image as of the miracles. Which have happened,
according to the informations gathered by the authority of the right Reverend
lord the Archbishop of Mecklin, howbeit through the diversities of times and
distance of places wherein the persons dwell unto whom God has imparted his
favors, it has been impossible to come to the perfect knowledge of each thing
that has befa^ne them, which notwithstanding we hope may be discovered in
time, and come to light, whereof as yet we have no knowledge, partly through the
negligence or simplicity of such as have experimented them in them selves, and
partly for that many are (perhaps) ashamed to publish their secret accidents
and maladies, although they have been miraculously cured thereof.

THE FOVRTH CHAPTER.
BUT before we proceed any furthes it will not be impertinent (considering in
this affair the great providence and goodness of God) to examine a little the
particular circumstances of the place, of the Image, and of other things
appertaning to this matter. It is a thing much to be noted, that seeing in many
rich and mighty Cities and other places of strength in these low Countries,
there are many stately Churches dedicated to the glorious Virgin Marie, and
that she has in so many places her Images in gold and silver, and painted or
carved with great art and woorkmanship, yet notwithstanding our Lord God (who
is the greatness of the humble) and our blessed Lady the mother o^ humility,
would make choice of this rude and desert hillock, in the territory of S^c^en,
a very poor town, amongst a company of poor and ruyned people, at a small
Image made of a silly piece of wood of the height of a foot and a half or
little more, pa^nted and set forth very fim ply, placed in an old Oak, and
that upon the frontiers of those that are enemies and rebels to our Princes.

The which things seem to me full of many masteries, And ^ist that what soever
concerns the place and Image, s very base and a^i^ct. What other thing does
it signify, then that which the Prophet David says, That the ^^g^ lord
respects the things that are humble? And that which the Apostle says, Our
lord has chosen the abject t^ings of this world? And that our Lord Jesus
Christ did mean that this place which he had appointed for his own and his
mothers honor should be like to the places of their habitation in this world,
where he made choice of two very low places, to wit, the one, that of Nazareth
for his incarnation and abode, and the other that of Bet lem with the poor
cribbe, for his natiuine. How poor and miserable that quarter of Sec^en has
been, with how many mishaps and calamities it was wholly ruined and brought to
desolation, will not be impertinent to declare, for the comfort of those poor
afflicted people the inhabitants thereof.

The town of Sic^en before these troubles had a fair parish Church dedicated
to S. Eustace, well furnished with diverse altars, ornaments and goodly belles.
Moreover it had a Cloister of Religiouse women of the order of S. A^stin, with
their Church and fa^re buildings accordingly. And now this town is so ruined,
that at this present there is not so much as one bell, The Church and steeple
are for the most part vnco^ered, There are few altars, and very small store of
ornaments that have been saved out of the fire, The Cloister is all burnt
down, saving one Chapel, and one little hows which before was built for the
sick. Moreover the said town had about twelve or thirteen hundredth Burgeses,
many of them were welthy and all of competent means and ability, where at
this present it is hard to find 300. souls therein, or in the places which are
dependant of the same, and all those are so needy and low brought that there
is not one of them of that ability as to entertain his friend with a decent
lodging.

This town here-to-fore had many fair houses built with brick and now they
are all made with mudde, and thatched with straw in form of a village, which
is no wounder if you consider what the town has sustained during these
troubles and civil garboiles.

After the defait of Ge^blours which happened in the year 1578. and the 28. of
February the Town and castle being well manned with a strong garrison was
besieged by the soldiers of the Catholic king, and after battrie being
entered by force, the soldiers of the garrison, were either put to the sword,
or drowned, or hanged, many of the Burgeses slain, and the town given over to
fire and pillage. Not many years after, it was taken again, sometimes by the
rebels, sometimes by the kings people. It was six times spoiled, and once
consumed even to ashes. Besides all this it was grieuouslie afflicted with the
plague and wholly deuowred and eaten up with the great garrisons which lay
therein continually. And not only the City, but the Country round about was
brought to such desolation by the ranging up and down of soldiers thieves and
murderers, that the Country, (for some miles) is so pestred with woods,
hedges, and bushes, that it is not only not habitable, but also trauailers ca^
scarcely find any way or passage thereunto, in such sort as I am persuaded
that there is no one place in all these low Count eis which has endured so
many miseries calamities and aduersi^ies as this place has. And
notwithstanding that the people are simple and still hold the fashion of the
(...) Brabanders, yet have they always continued in the obseruances of the
Catholic faith, so as even during the sway of here^ik^, here was not so much
as one found amongst them that changed his faith, whereby may be seen the
great mercy and love of God toward these miserable and afflicted people, the
which being brought under so many calamities he vouchsafes to comfort now
again by demonstration of his wounderful woorks amongst them.

THE FIFTH CHAPTER.
WHat should be the cause why our Lord vouchsafes to woork miracles in such a
part of the Country of Braban^, we may imagine (upon apparent reasons) that
he does it for two causes, upon apparent reasons I say we may imagine ( for
who is he that knows the mind of our Lord, or who is he that has been his
coun^^al^^?) first it has b^ne the custom of his divine providence when he
chastises any people for their correction and not for their destruction and
utter ruin, to ^end them at times some comfort by miraculous works of his
power and mercy. The people of Israel was afflicted by the servitude of Egypt,
by the stinging of serpents, by the invasion of the Madianits, and by other
like adue^sities, but to the end they might think that God had not altogether
forsaken them, he comforted them by transporting them over the red sea, he
cured them by the beholding of the brazen serpent, by staying of the Sun
under Iosue, by covering the fleece with dew lying on a dry place in the time
of Ge^eon, and by many other miracles. The Country of Italy was afflicted by
a cruel war betwixt the Gu^lphes and the Gibbelines, but our Lord vouchsafing
to show that he would send them a speedy deliverance translated thither
miraculouslie the hows of our Lady of Lau^etto.

Even so we verily hope that by these favors and miracles, the divine
bounty of God has given us to understand that he being moved with pity and
compassion upon these poor low Countries, will take away very soon the scourge
of his ire and indignation, to the end that we should not think our selves
wholly by him abandoned through the throng of so many oppressions and miseries,
and therefore he sends us now these tokens and presages of some deliverance
near at hand.

The other reason may be that those holy Saints which have dwelt and been borne
in this Country, and specially in Brabant have by their merits and prayers
obtained this grace of God that this place which they whiles they lived had in
their possession as their inheritance and patrimony wherein they were wont to
serve his divine majesty, or unto which they used to resort, being delivered
from the fury of heretics should be one day honored with so great miracles.

For this territory was once the patrimony of the first Saints of Brabant. It
is Molan. Not. SS. ^^lg.
well known that S. Bauo had in his possession the greatest part of the
Hasbaine of Brabant. It is also certain that S. Pipin Ian. 4. Feb. 21. Mar.
17. Iul* 10. and 16. Octo. 1. and 2^. Noue^b. 23.
first duke of Bra^ant had his abode in the town of Landen whereupon it bears
the surname: in the same place and with him lived his wife Iduberga, from
whence proceeded that holy offspring Gertrude and Begga, and of this Begga the
great Charlemaine with his issue is descended. In this said quarter also
dwelled being of the blood of the foresaid Pipin S. Amil^erga Dece^b. ^7.
mother of the holy virgins Raynildis, Pharaild^s, and Gudula, and long before
all these, S. Ermelinde a virgin right famous for her sanctity. Likewise S.
^rudo in his days possessed many places in the Has^aine and in the Campignie,
where he had preached the holy gospel, His mother Ad^la renowned for
miracles rests in a place called zel^^m near to the town of Die, which
place heretofore apperteined to her, and is but two miles distant Molan. lib de
sac. milit Duc. Braban.
from Montaigue. Add herunto that our Lord has remembrance of the zeal and
magnanimi^tie of the old dukes of Brabant, who a thousand years ago did so
valiantly maintain and advance the Christian Catholic faith against the
infidels Pagans, and heretics. And that it seems that the Country of
B^abant shalere long be who^e restored and settled again in the Catholic
faith, and in that glorious state wherein once it flourished.

THE SIXTH CHAPTER.
THat these things are done upon a Mountain is not without reao^s, in regard
that man being borne into this world to retire his mind from earth^^e to
heavenly things, our Lord, both in the old and new testament was always
wont to do his most special and principal works upon Mountains. Upon the
Mount Moria Isaac was saved, and Abraham received the benediction. Upon the
mount Sinay the law was delivered unto Moses. Upon the mount Horeb Helias saw
God almighty so much as a mortal man was ever able to see him, upon a Mountain
our Lord was wont to preach, upon the Mount Thab^r he was trasfigured, upon the
Mount Olives he prayed and upon the mount Calua^^ he was crucified, and
accomplished our salvation. Moreover the most famous places of the world where
the holy Mother of God is honored, are wyld Mountains and fu of wood, very
much resembling this our Mountain. They which have written the hutorie of
La^^e to, affirm that the little hovvs wherein the incarnation of our Lord was
first wrought and which was had in honor in the town of Nazareth, until the
year of our Lord 1291. (because Siria was conquered by the Sarracen^) was
taken from that place and transported into Europe into the Country of
Dalma^ia, and there set upon a little Mountain or hill nere to the ^owne of
T^rsactum. And for so much as ^n that place they did it not that honor which was
convenient, it came so to pass that 4. years and 7. months after, the said
little hovvs was by Angels transported into the marca of A^cona in Italy* and
set upon a Mountain or hill in a wood hard by the City of Recana^o, and a
li^le while after that, because the pilgrims were hindered to go freely thither
(through the multitude of Thieves and Robbers which made the passage dangerous)
it was miraculous^^e set upon an other hill belonging to two breethern, who
being fallen at variance for the offerings which were there made and our Lord
being offended with their controversies and covetousness, made the said little
house to be placed upon an other little Mountaigne not far from thence in the
year of our Lord 1294. where our good God woorketh (even to this present day)
continually many miracles and graces, to the comfort and strengthening of all
good Christians. What place is there in Spain more honorable and more renowned
for miracles, then that Mountain in the kingdom of Cath^lonia not far from
Barcelona called Mount-serrato? because it seems to have been cut with a saw,
and fitted for the service of the blessed virgin Marie, The which Mountain
(according to that which many credible persons have written) was in time past
in accessible through the wyndinges and troublesome passages which it has had:
and not habitable for the rocks and craggie stones which it contained, but at
this present, it is seemlie set forth with 13. hermitages and a goodly great
Monastery of S. Benedicts order, with many fair buildings, and a merueilous
multitude of Pilgrims. In which place since the year 801. until the year.
1599. there has been wrought 381. miracles, whereof a great part are approved
and confirmed by public and authentical testifications.

THE SEVENTH CHAPTER.
NEither seems it to want reason that our Lord would have his Mother to be
honored by her Image placed in an Oak, for the holy scriptures inform us that
our Lord God has wrought many miracles under diverse Oaks. For under the Oak of
Mambre according to the Hebrew text he concluded his league with Abraham, and
there promised him a son by his wife Sara. In the same place the Angels
appeared in form of me^, diverse times renewing in the name of God the foresaid
promise, and foretelling the destruction of the inhabitants of Sodom. under an
Oak nere unto Sic^e^ Jacob buried the Idols. Under the same Oak Ios^e renewed
the aliance between God and the people of Israel, as before we have declared.
Under the Oak in Ephra the angel ap ^ud 16.
peared to Ged^on whom he appointed Captain and leader of the people of
Israel, promising to free the^ out of the servitude, of the Madianits. Yea our
Lord Jesus Christ wrought our salvation upon the wood, of the cross which (as
Doctors affirm) was framed of Oak. The Pagans were wont to call the Oak, great
and holy, and dedicated it unto ^upiter their chief God, because in the
beginning of the world men made their food of acotnes, which is the fruit
thereof and the Romans had a custom to give him a crown of Oken leaves that
in war had saved the life of a Citizen of R^me. Of Oaks the Poet writes,
prophesying of the golden world out of the verses of the Si^illes saying.

The t^^e will come of peace and plenty so,

That from the Oak the honi^ sweet shall flow.

When therefore we consider the foresaid examples of the old testament why
should we not hope that nere unto this oak by Sic^en through the prayers of
holy and deuowt people. God may be inclined to make a new alliance and
reconciliatio^ betvv^xt himself and these lovv countries, that he vvil send the
Angel of vvisdome amongst us, bring the Idols of heresy and impiety to
nothing, raise us up some valerous Gedeons, grant us victory over these
Madianites, send comfort to the loyal subjects, strengthen both our souls and
bodies, and power down upon us the dew of his heavenly graces.

THE EIGHT CHAPTER.
THat our Lord has chose^ this place so nere unto our enemies which is scarce
six or seven hundredth paces distant from the river of Demer, beyond which
river all the Country is subject to the contributions robberies and exactions
of the enemies, so as upon a clear day one may see six or seven miles into the
country held by the heretics and rebels, we may thereby thinck that the
wisdom of God has ordained it, that not only the Catholics might have
occasion to exercise their p^ety, and seek for mercy at the hands of God but
also that he might bring back again those which are in error into the bosom
of the Catholic Church, by the means of these miracles: for that so great
miracles and such abundance should be wrought in a place so nere the heretics
noses, what other thing may we judge it, the^ a plain demonstration that the
hon^or do^ne to images, invocation of Saints, and pilgrimages made to holy
places, are things very p^ous and right acceptable to the majesty of God:
notwithstanding whatsoever blasphemies and scoffings, of all the rablement of
heretics to the co^t^ary.

Blessed be therefore the father of mercy and God of comfort, which comfort
us after this manner in all our tribulatio^s, who in the doleful estate of
these Countries, by the wonderful woorks of his mercy yields joy and
consolation to the godly, confirms those that either stagger or doubt in
their faith, and confounds the malice of heretics (God grant it may be to
their salvation) with a light of such unspeakable brightness. Blessed be also
the Mother of mercy, which procures such favors for us poor wretches. God
grant that her goodness will so dispose of us, that as at the arrival of her
hows from Nazareth to Ital^* that Country (which wa^ the^ oppressed with a
long and cruel war) gained peace and concord by her prayers to our Lord, so
likewise by this new devotion o^ Catholics at Mountague, the blessed virgin and
mother of God being moved to compassion, by the prayers tears and devout
sighs of good people, may obtein at the hands of God, for these low Countries
scourged with so long a civil war, and welnigh brought to utter ruin, that
the Idols of our sins may be buried under this Oak: that the heretyks may be
reduced to the union of the holy Catholyke, Apostolyke, and Roman Church, and
our rebels to their due obedience of their natural princes, that we may all
of us with one mouth, and in the same Catholic faith, under one Prince in
earth praise and honor our God, three persons in Trinity and one in unity,
and the blessed virgin Mary mother of our Lord Jesus Christ.

THE NINTH CHAPTER.
B^t to come to our history. In Braba^t there is a place full of hil^e^ and
woods and altogether uninhabited called in the Duitch tongue Scherp^n-^e^^^l, in
French Mountaigne. in English The sharp or rough hill, in regard of the
roughnes and barennes of the place, situated by the town of S^chen, and little
more then a quarter of a dutche mile distant from thence, and a good mile from
Die. Upon this place (being a hill somewhat higher then the rest of the
ground lying nere thereunto) grew an old Oak, which was somewhat great, whereunto
a certain Image of our lady was fastened, and there is a certain report and
old tradition amongst those people which live in that quarter, that a hundredth
years and more sithe^ce, there was a certain Shepherd who feeding his flock
along that Mountaigne fownd the fore said Image of our Lady lying on the
grownd, the which he determined to carry home with him, but the Image
miraculously became so heavy that he was neither able to carry it, nor to lift
it, yea himself became so immovable that he had no power to stir out of the
place, in such sort as he could not drive his f^ok homeward. The farmer his
Master much woundring at his Shepherds unaccustomed lingering, went himself to
seek him, And having understood the cause of his stay, perceived forthwith that
the Image which the Shepherd me^t to have carried home, was the^ame Image which
men used to honor at the Oak of Mountaigue. Wherefore he took it and without
any empeschment or resistance placed it again in the Oak. And the Shepherd as
though he had been unloosed and vn^ettered went his way home with his she^p
without any further difficulty. By the report of this miracle, the people that
neighboured thereabout being excited to devotion, began to yield reverence to
the place and Image, and repaired thither very often to crave help of the
blessed virgin, especialy against agues. The which things the most ancient
inhabitants of the place have auowched under their solemn oaths, that they
have hard their parents and ance^ors report: to wit, Arnould of Ecynde being
fourscore years of age, John S^innen being of 70. John M^mbors of 60. and
Allard of B^gard also of 60. years of age, all being inhabitants and
Escheuins of Sichen. But forasmuch as we have this only by tradition of
certain old people without any further authentical proof (although well
deserving credit heerin) we mean not so to affirm their reports as
altogether assured thereof. But will proceed to such other things, whereof we can
aleage so authentical and assured proofs, as none can justly doubt thereof.

THE TENTH CHAPTER.
IT is certain and well known that the foresaid Image remained in the Oak
until the year 1580, but shortly after and till the year 1587. was no Image
at all in that place, as we find by ^osse v^ Artric who yet lives has
affirmed under his o^he that he was healed of a long ^uartain agu in the year
^583.
information of sundry persons who in that time (to be cured of their agues)
although with evident danger visited that place, many being restored to health
notwithstanding (as is aforesaid) no Image was then there, whereby it may
appear that not only the Image, but also the very place is dedicated to the
service of God, and to the honor of his blessed Mother. How this first Image
was lost we yet know no certainty, but it is coniectured that it was destroyed
by heretics who from the year 1578 until the year 1586. ranged daily in
those parts pilling and spoiling the Country.

Afterward in the year 1587. a good old man being a Burgess and Escheum of
S^chen (of humility not willing to be named) considering the great concour^e
and devotion which people had to this place, and knowing that the first Image
was lost, went unto a devout and godly widow dwelling in Die, called Agnes
Fredericks having the custody of the Church of All^all was in the suburbs of
the said town of Die who had in her hows an Image of our lady made of wood,
placed in a little frame or tabernacle, which upon ernest entreaty she giving
unto him, he carried to Mountague, and caused it to be set up in the foresaid
Oak, in the place of the other which was lost; where it continued until lent
in the year 1602. at which time Sir Godsrey of Thie^^r^ncle Pastor of the
Church of S. Eustace in Su^e^, took the said Image out of the Oak, and set it
in a little Chapel made of wood of six foot long and five broad, hard by the
sa^d Oak. And the same he did in regard of the great devotion which he saw the
people had that came thither to be cured of a vehement headache then reigning
in those parts whereof very many found amendment. In which little Chapel the
said Image remained until such time as it was placed in the new Chapel which
now is built of stone.

THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER.
LEt us now therefore speak of the miraculous and liberal cures which our lord
has vouchsafed to woork upon those that have honored his blessed mother in
this place.

From time out of mind the people and inhabitants of Sichen and places
therabout, were wont to find singular help by our Lady at Mountague so often as
they found themselves attainted of any agues.

Of which thing Sir Godsrey of Thienwincle Curat of S. Eustace in Sichen, does
sufficiently testify: who reme^breth that (fifty years past) he being then
about six years old, was carried by his parents to Mou^tague, where he was
cured of an ague which he had at that time,

Also at such time as the Spanish soldiers were in mutiny in the town of
Die and that their Captains remained in the town of Sichen attending whiles
the said soldiers were paid, there was a certain Spanish Captain lodged in a
Burgeise hows who was sick of an ague for the space of a whole year, and by
reason of his sickness was so wayward and troublesome as none could content him.
It came to pass that the good wife of the hows told him that if he desired to
be freed of his ague, it were good he should visit our lady at Mountague,
seeing so many were there cu^ed: whereupon moved partly by her and partly by
persu^sion of his own servants, he went thither, and accomplishing there his
devotion, was there cured, and wholly delivered of his ague, behauing himself
afterward so modestly and peaceably as he seemed to have altered his nature.

Moreover as the whole town of Sichen can testify, there is scarce therein
one household whereof some one or other has not received help at Mountague. The
Curate and escheuins of Sichen affirm assuredly that in the year 1598 at what
time the Irish of the regiment of Sir Wiliima Stanley Coronel, were lodged
there, many of the^ were wont to use no other phisik or remedy for their
diseases, but to make their prayers at the foresaid place of Mountague, amongst
whom very many were healed, in such forte that Father Walter Talbo^ an Irish
priest, one of the society of Jesus (who at that time was their preachet and
ghostly father) was wont oftentimes to say with great admiration that this
place was in very singular manner chosen by God to advance there his Mothers
honor, for which cause he was moved to go thither sometymesdenoutly in
procession, acco^pained with the said Irish and the townsmen of Sichen. Whereof
he wrote to Father Thomas Salius, who was the Superior of the fathers of the
society, which attended upon the Catholic kings army in the low Countries.
Many also affirm that the like cures have happened to diverse soldiers of other
nations, which came thither in pilgrimage both of the garrison of Die and
Sichen. And some are of opinion, that the brute and fame of Mou^tague was
principally diuulged by the same soldiers, in other Cities and places unto
which they repaired.

THE TWELFTH CHAPTER.
THe which brute by Gods disposition, in short time grew to be so great, that
it moved an ^^^^^t number of people which have flocked thither upon devotion
from all parts, whereof many have been helped and conforted, as may appear by
so many crutches, staves, bands and other things (which the sick persons used
in their maladies) left and hanged about the Chapel. For in the beginning of
the month of October in the year 1603. there were reckned up, to the number of
135. Crutches and legs of wood, of such as were lame, and they were brought
thither within the space of 4. or 5. months, without n^mbring the bands and
trusles of such as were broken, and the shoes which were vnderlayd belonging
to such as limped, vvherof the number would have been at this present double,
if (through the negligence of those who served the place) they had not been
carried away by other pilgrims and passengers. All which things were
undoubtedly left there by them who received either cure or notable eas^ of
their maladies. And to the end we may speak a word touching the number of
pilgrims, it is known by the relation of diverse credible persons, how that
upon the eight of September in the foresaid year 1603. being the feast of the
Nat^^t^ie of our Lady, there were about twenty thousand pilgrims, and upon
other days there have come thither many thowsands, and daily yet comes
thither a great number from all Countries and quarters, and they not only of
the common forte, but also diverse Princes, Earls, Lords, Gentlemen and
Ladies, the rehersall of whose names would here be too tedious.

THE XIII. CHAPTER.
THe same is also confirmed by the offerings, in Silver, Coin, Candles, Images
of silver, and of other matter representing the limbs and persons of those who
there have either found cure or ease. The precious beads and other gifts in
silver, and very rich vestures for the Image of our lady, whereof the number is
very great. And it will not be from the purpose to specify and name some of
the^: First the Magistrates of the City of Bruxelles (wherein at that time the
plague was very hot) sent in the month of September 1603. to the honor of
our lady of Mountague a fair crown of silver guilt, with this inscription in
latin: Reginae Calorum SS. Dei Matri B. Virgini Mariae, Bruxella morb^ afflicta
supplex ^btu^^t. Anno 1603. Which is as much to say. The City of Bruxelles
being afflicted with the pestilent disease, in humble manner ^ffreth this
Crown to the Queen of heaven, to the most holy Mother of God, the blessed
virgin Mariae: in the year 1603. And very many of good credit did note, that
after that time the contagious disease that had raig ned all that summer began
to decrease and by little and little to be aswaged.

The Magistrates and people of A^t^erp (who hau^e of old been much obliged and
affectioned to our lady their patroness) made a present unto her at Mountague
the eight of December 1603. being the feast of her conception, of two silver
candlesticks very cunningly wrought with these verses and inscription.

Suscipe Sancta Pare^s ex v^t^ Ant^erpi^ manus: Quod dat, ne pe^tis crescat
ac^rb^ ^ues. I must not forget the most honorable and devout Princess Dame
D^r^the of L^raine, widow to the Duke of Brunswick, who upon the eight of
October in the year aforesaid 1603. offered at the said place unto our Lady, a
fair ornament to hang before the Altar, recommending unto our blessed Lady her
^ourney, which she took out of these low Countries into Loraine.

The noble lady Dame Elcon^r Henriq ez de G^zman, widow to the Earl of Vseda,
Chief Cha^berlaine of the most gracious Infant of Spayn, the lady Isabella
Duchess of Brabant, presented there a fair gilt cup.

Omitting to make mention of a goodly foundation made to the Chapel of our
Lady, by a principal person of the court, who desired his name should be
concealed: and of many other gifts and offerings made there by diverse others,
whose reward is like to be great before God.

THE FOVRTENTH CHAPTER.
Our most gracious and devout Princes Albertus and Isabella are not to be
omitted: for first the Archduke Albertus returning from raising the siege of
Botsleduke, which was beleagred by the rebels of Holland, and going to
Bruxelles came to Mountague, on the tenth of November 1603, where he gave
thanks to our lord for his victory, and there did honor to his holy Moother,
and some few days after, he went thither another time from thesa^d City of
Bruxelles, together with the Duchess his wife, and all his Court, and very
many lords and gentlemen: where beein^ arrived upon the twentieth of the-said
month of November, the said Archduke and Duchess, as right devout Princes,
with all the lords and ladies of their trayn, made their prayers upon their
knees for a long space, as well for their own as for their countries welfare:
and from thence they went to lodge in the town of Dust, which is distant a
duitche mile and a half from that place. And after they had made their
preparation by fasting and confession, to receive the sacred communion,
returned the next day (which was the feast of the presentation of our Lady) to
4 english mile and a half.
Mountague on foot, and all their trayn, an^ there devoutly hard three masses,
at the first whereof the Princes only did communicate, at the second all the
ladies (...) estate and gentlewomen of honor to the An ex^ple of a deuo^t
court.
Princess, and at the third all the rest of the Court. And to the end their
prayers might be of more force the Princes added a good alms ther^^to. The
most gracious I^fanta Isabella three days immediately one after another,
ateuentyde offered a most precious roabe, imbrodred with gold and silver and
most precious ^^ones, the which roabes for the most part were wrought with her
own hands* And besides this, the most gracious Archduk Albertus caused a notable
alms to be given over and besides that which he had offered at his return from
B^is^eduke. And upon the fourth day the said Princes returned to Bruxelles,
where they surceased not to have care of the good ordering and adorning of the
foresaid place of Mountag^^. And amongst other the Archduke of his own
invention ordained a very fair form and manner to plant there certain orders
of trees in proportion, amongst which there should be built fourteen ^^^le
Chappelles or stations, to represent the joys and sorrows of the holy mother
of God: and this to be contrived in such order and fashion that all the hill
should seem to appear in form of a ^^arre, which signifies the name of the
virgin Mary* And moreover it is to be provided of a hedge and ditch round about
that it may be Hortus conclusus, a Garden round (...): a name which the holy
scripture affords to our Lady. And besides all this our said Princes have made
there an oblation of a marvelous sumptuous ornament, together with a Chesuble
and Copes for the Deacon and Subdeacon to celebrate divine service therein.

THE XV. CHAPTER.
But to come to the miracles: let us begin with the entrance of the year 1603.
and some months before; after which time especially about Easter the principal
of them happened. And we will set them down according to every month, so far
forth as they came to our knowledge, adding unto the^ those which afterward
insued, as also those whereof we have gotten information (...) the first
publishing of this history: p^^cing every one in their due order, according to
the times in which they came to pas: to the end that our Lord (who vouchsafed
to work these things by the intercession of his Mother) might receive the
honor and glory which unto him is due, and that all Christians as well those
which are misguided and in error, as others might consider and touch with
their fingers, where the light of truth has her abode, and where is the true
sheep* fold, wherein they may expect and hope to obtain their everlasting
salvation.

Of a blind wooman which was cured.
PEtronel Riders wife to Lambert Bauduin About the month of May or June 160^.
sometime soldier, and launcier under the Lord of Grobbendonck in the Country
of Brabant, in the year 1602. being at Dust had a great defluction of humors,
which fell upon her eyes, and a great and vehement grief insued thereupo^ as if
her eyes had been gnawne with some vermin: which increaced so much that she
utterly lost her sight: notwithstanding that many medicines were applied unto
her both by the advice of surgeons, as others, of which she received no help at
all: in such sort that she could not see or decerne any thing in the world
which continued more then eight or ten days. At which time a certain woman
seeing her in this plight, advised her to go unto our Lady at Montaigu where
many had been cured of their agues, hoping that there she should find some help
for her disease. Moreover she counseled her to wash her eyes with the water
which is behynd the Chapel of the foresaid Montaigu. Whereupon the said
Petronel resolved to go thither in pilgrimage, and having sought out a woman
in Die to lead her, she walked (starck blind) toward the said Montaigu
about the Month of May or, June, in the said year 1602: but as soon as she
began to go up the hill toward the chapel, she felt the accustomed griefs of
her eyes to be much assuaged, and with all her self to be much inwardly
comforted. Which alteration after she had perceived, she would needs try
whether she had recovered any thing of her sight or no, so that with her
fingers lifting up her eyelids, she perceived that she began to see (as it
were through an obscure mist) the grass and bushes of the Mountain, and a
little afterward setting somewhat forwards, she perfectly saw the little
chapel of wood where the Image of our Lady was placed, and hereupon* she
spoke to the woman which led her, and thancking her for her pains told her
that she needed her help no longer, for that she had now recovered her
sight: and so the said Petronel went alone without any other aid toward the
foresaid water, where having washed her eyes, she fell to her devotions in the
Chapel of our Lady, rendering thancks to God and her, for this worck of
mercy: and so returning whole and merry to her hows at Die has ever since
inioyed perfectly her sight, and has been free from al her former pains, and
yet so remains to this present day, as it appeared upon the six and twentieth
of June in the year 1604. when in the city of Bruxelles before the
Magistrates there by solemn oath she affirmed all that has been said,
conformable to an act framed thereof subsigned P. Numan Secretaire, and sealed
with the s^ale of the said City.

How blood was found, upon the lips of the Image of our Lady.
Upon the third of January in the year 1603. diverse Magistrates and The third
of January 1603.
other persons were met together at Sichen from the next villages about some
affairs appertayning to that quarter. Amongst others Matthew O^de^^^gge
Escheuin of Bekeu^rt, Walter V^kelen Escheuin of VVanr^de, Henry Reymakers
Escheuin of VVersbeke, Bartholmew Schellens, and Laurens of Ca^ten were there
preset. Who after they had ended all their business at Sichen, returning
homeward, and passing by Montaigu, they did their devotions in the Chapel of
our Lady; and whilst they were in prayer, the said Walter Vnkelen espied a
drop of blood upon the lip of the image of our Lady, whereupon drawing near
to the image, he wyped of the drop with his finger, and he found that it was
perfect blood, and incontinently an other like drop returned, the which was
wyped away by Matthew O^de^^ogge: and as an other the third time appeared, it
was wyped of by Henry Reymakers: and the foresaid Walter Vnk^len seeing the
fourth drop of blood to appear upon the lip, took a cloth or handkerchief,
and dried it, and found a marck of very blood in the same, even such as might
issue out of the body of a living man: whereupon they were meruelously
astonished: and the next morning this Walter looking upon his hand-kerchief,
found the said drop to have spread itself as large as an English groate, and
some what bleaker of color then it was the day before. These aforenamed
persons while yet they were in the Chapel, looked diligently on every side,
to see whether the Image might receive any moisture through the roof, but they
found no sign at all of any such thing: for it was a very fair and clear
Sunne-shyny day, and there was never any paynting or color laid on the picture
so far as any man could remember. And all this which has been said, was
auerred by the foresaid persons, under their sole^n oaths before the
Magistrates of the town of S^^hen, in the presence of many witnesses, as
appears by a writing made hereof, and subsigned L. van Ogernen, and sealed
with the seal of the said town: and it is very certain, that in the first
three months of this accident, to wit, in the holy week before Easter, the
said picture by reason of the oldnes thereof, by the appointment of the Curate
and Church-warde^s was newly painted.

How a lame maid was healed.
MArie Lenkens daughter of Francis In April. ^. ^3.
Lenkens and Cat^arin Vermo^en being ten years of age, had an accident that
happened her in her right leg, in the year 1599, in such sort that the said leg
was shrunck up and became three fingers shorter then the other, and withal
smaller and slenderer, in which sort she continued for three years space
together, although with great anguish and pain, and the third year she was
not able to go therewith in any sort, whereupon her mother resolved toe go
with her in pilgrimage to our lady of Montaigu: the which she did upon the
feast of the Annunciation of the virgin Marie, in the said year 1603, putting
her daughter on horsback, and being come to the river of Demere, near to a
place called Tystelt, where by horse they were notable to pass they sent the
said horse back again, and they both walked together on foot toward Montaigu,
the poor lame maiden halting downright, and often falling to the ground,
before they could arrive at the Chapel of our Lady: Where being come
exceedingly weerie, they did their devotions: which being ended, the maid
recovered so much strength, that she returned home with her mother on foot,
without any molestation pain or wearines neither at that present time, or ever
after: and since that time her leg by little and little grew of aequall bigness
and length with the other, in such sort that she now walks without any
difficulty, wheresoever she pleases, as well as any other. Al which has been
affirmed by her mother under her solemn oath before the Magistrates of the town
of Ar^t^^t: and Marie vander N^is widow of Christian vanden Vinne dwelling in
Arschot, who accompanied them in their pilgrimage, together with Henry Godfrey
Michtels, who was neighbor unto the said maid, did in lyk sort under their
oaths avouch before the said Magistrates, that they had seen and known the
foresaid maid lame and impotent, and afterward to have been miraculously
cured, as has been said: all which appears by an act made thereof by the said
Magistrates, bearing date the xxixth of March in the year 1604, subsigned P.
Aelbrechts, and sealed with the seal of the town of Arschos.

How a man sick of the palsy was healed.
PEser of Honsberg Escheuin of Merhout In April, 1601.
in the Campignie, being of the age of one and fifty years, fell suddenly
into a great disease, in the end of the Month of January 1606, the which
continuing for ten or twelve days space, thereupon ensued so great a palsy,
that he was deprived of the use of his arms and legs, and of all his other
members, his head eyes and tongue only excepted, which he was able to move.
And besides this, he had a grief that was so vehement and continual, that he
could neither sleep or rest day or night: in such sort that from Palmesunday
till eight days after Easter he was fame to have every night at least two,
sometimes three or four of his family to watch with him, and to administer
unto him his necessities, sometimes to carry him to the fire, and presently
back to his bed again. Who albeit he had used the counsel and receiptes of some
Physicians for his recure, yet felt he no ease at all, but rather increase of
his grief which made him wholly to give them over. And whereas certain of the
inhabitants of Merbou^ had related unto him that by the invocation of Gods
Mother many miracles were wrought at Mo^taig^^ near to Die, he entering into a
fervent and zealous resolution, to take her for his refuge, and to go in
pilgrimage to that place: and withal to Boxtele in the Campigni^, where the
miraculous blood of the holy Sacrament of the altar is reserved; in the mean
while with many tears and groans calling upon the glorious virgin Mary, and
with great desire expecting the feast of the Annunciation of our Lady, (which
was very near, and was that year translated til after the octaues of Easter,
for that it fell in the holy week;) and so much the more because he had
understood that diverse of his neighbors were resolved that day to go in
pilgrimage to Montaig^, which day of the Annunciatio^ when it came, he caused
himself to be carried in a wagon to the foresaid mountain, continually
afflicted with the palsy and impote^cie of all his limbs: save only that
some two or three days before his departure, and whylst his servants made
ready those things which were necessary for his voyage, he began a little to
move his fingers. Being therefore the same day arrived at Montaigu, he found
such a throng of people, that he could not in any wise come near unto the
Chapel. For which cause, to satisfy his devotion, they brought him the image
of our lady to the waggo where he lay, the which with much reverence he
kissed: and after the press of the people was past, his wife withone of his
servants and two others carried him three times about the said Chapel: and no
sooner was he put again into the wagon, but he felt in himself a great change
and ease: in such sort that he thought himself wholly cured: but trying to move
himself, he found that he was as yet impotent and without the use of his
limbs. Notwithstanding being returned home, he felt that his palsy by little
and little from that day forward began to decreace: and every day after he
found himself better, in so much that in short time he recovered so great force
and health, that he could permit himself to be led through his hows: and a
little while after he walked without any help of his crutches, which also with
in few days he laid aside, walking only with a staf in his hand, and not long
after without either staf or any other help at all: in such sort that this
Ho^sberge being restored to perfect health and strength, and use of his limbs,
failed not to render thancks to God, and his holy Mother: and upon the eigth of
the month of September next following being the day of the Nativity of the
glorious Virgin, he departed from his hows on horseback, to offer unto our Lady
one of his Crutches wherewith he was wont to support himself: and from the town
of Sichen he went on foot to the Chapel of Mo^taig^, where he did his
devotion, and gave God thancks for the mercy which he received as has been
said. And since that time he has continued well disposed and healthie, as he is
at this present And this that has been here said, is set down in the Register
of the said Chap pel upon the eigth day of Septembre 1603. And as by the said
Honsberg it was again declared (being su^moned thereunto) under his solemn
oath before the court and Magistrates of Merbo^t, upon the seventh of March in
the year 1604. Upon which day VVillebrord Bosmans, Adrian Verhelle^ and John
S^i^ne^ Escheuines of the same place, declared and avouched, that they had
diverse times see^ and visited this Honsberg while he was sick, and that they
found him altogether taken with the palsy and impotent and deprived of the use
of his limbs. Al which is conformable to that which the magistrate has set
down, dated as before, and subsigned John Trudo^ius Secretary: and sealed with
their seal.

A cure of one that was blind and taken with the Apoplexy.
ANne Vereyken the wife of Hubert VVell^^s dwelling in the village of In May
1603.
Test^l^, not far from the town of Sichen was in the month of February in
the year 1603. taken with the Apoplexy, and there with also lost her sight in
so much that her husband was forced to carry or lead her to every place,
whether she would go. And although many medicines were applied to cure her
disease, yet she found no help or cure at all: wherefore she took her refuge
toward our Lady, and made a promis to go and visit her at Montaigu, the
which when she had accomplished in the month of May next following, she
recovered her sight and the intier health of al her body, and went up and down
wheresoever it pleased her, and always afterward remained in good state as she
is at this present. All this here related, was according to order of law
declared both by her self and her husband before the Magistrates of Siche^, as
well upon the eleventh of May in the foresaid year 1603, ^s also upon the one
and twentieth of April 1604. According to a writing framed hereof and signed
L^van Ogernen Secretary, and sealed with the town seal.

The punishment of one that scoffed at the Pilgrimage of Mountaigu.
A Certain townesman of Die (whose name for certain causes we do not In May
1603.
set down) began to mock at such as went in Pilgrimage to Montaigu, and a
little after was stricke^ in his body, in such sort that he became lame, and
altogether deprived of the use of his limbs, and sustai ned such vehement
torments that he was constrained to keep his bed: and although he had procured
certain medicines and remedies to be ministered unto him, yet could he not be
helped. Wherefore at last resolving with himself to go and visit our Lady at
Montaigu: and having obtained some strength after this his resolution, he
walked thither by little and little on foot: and so soon as he had performed
his pilgrimage, he recovered and was wholly cured, as it appears by the
information hereof taken in the town of Die, by certain commissioners that
were sent thither by the Right Reverend the Lord Archbishop of Maclin.

How a Child that was in a consumption and blind was healed.
I Oane Ma^s the widow of Lewis Castel^ In May 160^.
dwelling in the town of Die, had a child of one year old or thereabout: who
was taken with a great malady, which kept him in his bed more the^ three whole
months continually, whereby he was brought so low, that he had nothing left but
skin and bones: he had moreover a swelling in his throat, which by diverse
surgeons was judged to be some vain that was broken, by others, that it was
some evil matter or humor which was descended thither. And besides these he
had an accident in his eye, the which being showed to the surgeons, they were
of opinion that the eye was broken out, and that the piece of the sight was
corrupted, as in very deed the child could see nothing therewith* and they were
persuaded that he should never see with it so long as he lived: the which child
was come to those terms, that his mother expected no other thing of him but
that he should shortly die. Nowithstanding putting her confidence in the mercy
of God, and in the assistance of his most sacred Mother, she resolved to go
with her Child, and to visit our Lady at Mo^taigu on three several Frydayes:
and notwithstanding that the mother was also ^^^k, yet she accomplished her
Pilgrimage in the beginning of the so^mer, in the year 1603. And the first day
that she was at the Chapel, she laid her child upon the altar, so long as she
made her prayer: which being ended, and returning homeward, the child fell
sweetly a sleep in her arms, and so continued til she came to Die: and in
this so^te persisting in her devotions the two next frydayes following, the
child was made whole and sound, and by little and little recovered the perfect
health both of his body and of his eye; with which he now ^^eth very clearly,
and remains in very good plight. All this those of the Court of Die have
witnessed, after the hearing and examination of the a foresaid Ioane,
conformable to a writing that was drawn thereof, bearing date the XXth of March
1604. subsigned I. vanden Goedenhu^se, and sealed with the seal of the said
town,

One cured of the Iaunders and Squinancie.
THe Lady Francis de i^^ombeck, Abbess In May 1603.
of the Cloister of Hoght near to the city of Maestright in the Duchy of
Braba^t in the beginning of May, 1603, was attain ted with the Iaunders,
whereof she became so sick, that having had the advice of a certain Phisitio^
which dwelled at Lie ge he was in despair of her life as he plain ly affirmed
to Dame Catharin Cortilz, Religiouse of the said Convent, yet he sent the said
lady Abbess some herbs with a certain drink, but it profited her nothing and
as her disease daily increased, so that she had little hope by any way of
Physic, she committed her self unto God almighty, and to the help of the
glorious Virgin Marie, promising by vow unto God and her, a pi^grim^g^ and an
alms unto the chapel of our Lady at Montaigu, and two or three days after
she s^nt thither he^ maid O^ae T(...)r ma^^, the which was con upon the xxv^i*
rof May in the foresaid year 1603. who having ended her devotion she brought
her Lady a piece of the Oak wherein the blessed Virgins Image was set: the
which the said lady Abbess receiving with all reverence and devotion, caused
it to be applied to every thing that either she did eat or drinck: trusting in
God, and hoping through the intercession of his holy mother that she should
find remedy thereby, and from that day she began oame^d and to recover
perfectly her health, without any human help: in so much that a little while
after she was made whole and sound. Afterward the^e happened unto her a great
sorenes and pain in her throat, which Physitio^s call the Squinancie, whereby
she was brought again into manifest peril of death, as the surgeon openly
declared whom they had sent for to help her. Her tongue and throat were so
inflamed, that they seemed altogether black: and although, they opened a vain
in her tongue, three or fowr times together, yet it helped nothing, for not one
drop of blood would come forth, which when the-sayd Lady Abbess had
perceived, and understanding the danger wherein she was, she vowed an other
pilgrimage to our Lady of Montaigu, and sent thither again the foresaid Oda,
and VVindel Corenborst her servants, who having ended their devotions upon the
xxvj. of June 1603. the-sayd Lady Abbess recovered afterward, and within
few days returned to her perfect health. As it well appears by her
attestatio^ signed with her own hand, and sealed with her seal.

Of a lame and impotent man healed.
BE^^ra^d de Loyarbre locksmith dwelling at H^y in the cuntrie of Liege, was,
(some three years past) attached with a In May 2603.
vehement pain in his reins, and about his heart, in such sort that he could
not follow his occupatio^ except very seldom and that fair and softly: the
which pain continued very long, and at one time for the space of six whole
months: whereby he was brought so low, that he was constrained to keep his
bed, from October 1602, until Easter eve 1603. and then (although he was very
sick) he endeavored to rise, but he found his left beg (by the long and
continual pains thereof) to be much shrunck up, and by a good foot to have
become shorter then the other, whereby he was forced to take two crutches, and
with them he walked in great pain and feeblenes. So it came to pass, that on
the day of S. Peter and S. Paul, being the xxix. of ^^^e, in the foresaid
year 1603. he hard some relate the miracles of our Lady of Montaigu: whereby
he was so moved, that he purposed with a great and fervent desire to go thither
on foot with his crutches, and alone with out the assistance of any other:
which he did, walking on very slowly, although not without great grief and
labor of his body: in such sort, that within fowr days and an half he came
to the Chapel at Mo^taigu, which for all this was not past ten miles distant
from H^y: having his hands and fingers much swollen, and the skin worn of by
the continual handling of his crutches, with had also much opened or strained
his arm pittes. And being now come before the Chapel, he made there
devoutly his prayers unto God and his glorious Mother, which being e^^s^d, he
raised up himself fair and softly without his crutches, and began to walk
praying about the Chapel, although not without great pain: but at the second
time he felt a certain soudaine puff of vvynd, to come down as it were from
heaven upon him, in so much as he feared he should have been thrown down to
the earth, by which vvynd he felt a kind of motion and svveet heat to enter
in to his body, whereby he thought his interior parts were vvarmed and
wholy altered: and so going the third time about, he found himself intierly
cured; and that his left leg (which before was a foot shorter then the right)
was now made longer and aeq^ual with the other, and that he could well use
it: yea, he found it stonger then his leg that before was whole: where with
being much comforted, having re^dred tha^ckes to God, and his holy Mother, who
had prayed for him, he left there his crutches, and walked homeward to Huy on
foot without them. And in August next following, and an other time after that,
he came on foot to Montaign, in memory and gratitude of the favor he had
there received: and the^ he was much eased of the pain he felt about his heart,
which he had very long endured. All this which here has bee^ set down, this
Bertra^d declared at Mo^taigu, before M. James de Castro, doctor of divinity
and Deane of the Christiantie of Die, Sir Godfrey Thie^ win^kle Curate of
Sichen, Master Ioachim de Buschere Secretary of the Cou^cil of Brabant, Peter
de Hem Notarie, and many others who were then present: and after this again it
was all affirmed and verified under a solemn oath by the foresaid Bertrand
(being summoned thereunto) before the sworn Bourgemaister* and Council of the
said town of Huy, as it appears by their attestation made under their seal,
and signed by the secretary of the same town, dated the xvijth. of January
1604.

Of one that had a withred hand, and how it was afterward healed.
MArie Isertant the daughter of Andrew Isertant, dwelling at Esselbeke near In
I^ne 160^.
to ^ousso^, hand by the City of Aken, was in the year 1603. surprised with a
great mailadie, whereof she feeling her self abettred, endeavored to go into a
cave of the hows to fetch something thence, and being come to the last step,
was suddenly taken with a certain kind of Appoplexie: which made her fall
down to the grownd, having much hurt her self on her left side, and especially
her hand and foot on that side, in such sort that she could do no manner of
woork: and was forced to walk with a crutch, for other wise she was not able to
go and in this manner she continued ten whole weeks.

In the mean while, having hard report of the miracles which by the
invocation of our Lady, were wrought at Mo^taigue she resolved likewise to go
thither for the recovery of her health: and arrived at the place upon the xxth
of June, in the same year 1603. and so soon as she drew near to the mountain,
she began to feel a great, yea an intolerable gnawing, in her left hand, which
was so lame, fast closed together, and dead, that she had no feeling thereof,
no not when they pricked it with any sharp pointed thing. When with certain of
her neighbors she was come up to the Chapel, they went about it some times on
foot, some times on their knees, making their prayers very devoutly: and forth
with her dry and dead hand opened of it self, to the great admiration and
comfort both of her self, and of all those that assisted her. For more proof
whereof, withdrawing her self into a cottage which was in that mountain, made
her self ready and dressed her head, as well with the one hand as with the other,
and this in the sight of very many: which for the space of the foresaid te^
weeks she was never able to do: and thus returning whole to her home, she
continued ever after very well, as she remains at this present xth of March in
the year 1604. On which day she affirmed and avouched all that has been said,
in the foresaid city of Aken in the presence of Master Peeter Hensenius
Lice^tiate in divinity, Curate of S. Foillie^, S^eue^ Radermaker de Kelmis
maier of E^eburg near unto Esselbeke, Leonard Loop de Kelmis and Brice Isertant
brother unto this Marie, all which last three did in like manner affirm, that
they had see^ the said Marie attainted with the Apoplexy and palsy, as has
been said, conformable to a writing framed here of bearing the date above
specified.

Of a lame young man cured.
HEnry Capenbergh son of John Capenbergh In July 1603.
dwelling near unto Kerckraid, in the territory of Shertogen-rode in the
Cuntrie beyond the Me^se, was lame of both his legs, and so had continued
eight years continualy, in such sort, that he could hardly go with crutches:
and although his father had caused all ma^n ^ of remedies and medecines to be
applied unto him, yet could he not procure him any help or ease at all. But
after he had hard tell of the miracles which were wrought at Montaigu, he took
his way thitherward with his crutches, to perform there his devotion, hoping,
that the glorious Mother of God would not fail to assist him, and to pray for
him. At which place he arrived the second of Iulie 1603. being the feast of
the Visitatio^ of our Lady, and there offered up his prayers right devoutly
before the Chapel: which being ended, he felt himself much eased and in
better order the^ before: and as he returned homeward, passing by Ake^ and
there praying to the Virgin Marie in her church which is in that city, he
found himself so much bettered, that there he left and offered up one of his
crutches. Neuer-the-lesse once again he returned with one crutche to Montaigu,
in the end of the aforesaid month, where having renewed his prayers, he found
himself perfectly whole and recovered, so that leaving his other crutch at our
Ladies Chapel, home he returned safe and sound, with out the help of any to
assist him, as he still continues, and was so upon the xviijth. of February in
the year 1604, on which day he declared and affirmed the foresaid
particularities, before the Magistrates of Ache as is to be seen by a writing
penned thereof, subsigned Nicolaus Munsterus Secretary, and sealed with the
seal of thesayd City.

Of a woman that was cured of many strange accidents.
IOane Cas, wife unto William de Bois In July 1603.
dwelling at Ia^bez in the suburbs of the City of Namures* was broken on both
^^des, each rupture coming forth as bigg as ones fist: the which she had
endured for the space of eleue^ or twelve years. And in the year 1601. in the
month of May throwing hay out of her loft, down she fell, and broke her right
leg, to the cure whereof she e^ploied many remedies and medcines, but she
could not be so well helped but that she remained lame and impotent on that leg:
in such sort that she was constained to walk with a crutch, and her leg
remained very full of pain. Moreover in the year 1603, in the month of Iulie,
her stomach swelled as great as a man's head, whether it was by any inward
rupture of that part which Physicians call P^ritonau^, in which the bowels are
contained, or by some other accident, so it was, that it bred in her such a
disease and vexation, that she was brought to such extremity, that she was
reddy to give up the ghost, and this according to the judgment of her Curate,
and of Master Hermes Petit Doctor of Physic in Namures. The patie^t being in
these terms, it happened that a certain woman of her acquaintance called
Catharin Meurisse came to visit her, who seeing her in such anxietie and
danger, counseled her, and said, she might do well to vow some Pilgrimage to our
Lady at Montaigu near to Sichen, affirming that she her self by this means
was cured of the grauel wherewith she had been long time afflicted. Which when
the said patient had hard, whith great devotion she said, that she did promise
to go that Pilgrimage through the grace and assistance of almighty God. And on
the same day about some three hours after she had thus promised, the aforesaid
Ioane Cas found her self intierly whole and cured, as well of her Rupt^^es, as of
the swelling of her stomach: and so rising out of her bed, she began to walk up
and down her hows, not only without her cruch wherewith she was wount to help
herself before, but also without any stick or staff or any other thing else to
support her. And from that day forward she could go with one shoe vnderlayd
and made higher the breadth of ones hand, because her broken leg was become so
much more short the^ the other. And in October following, she accomplished her
pilgrimage to our Lady at Montaigu as before she had vowed; which when she had
performed, she felt greater ease in her leg the^ before, in so much that her
shoe is now but of an inch high, which was of a handbredth high before. And
all this that has been here set down, the said Joan Cas declared and verified
under her solemn o^he, in the hands of C. R^m^s Notarie, in presence of the
Reverend Sir Giles Bosman Chanon and Archpriest of the Bishopric of Namures,
and Pierchon Pimperneau witnesses, comfortable to a public writing framed
hereof, and subsigned by the said Notarie and dated the ixth. of April 1604.

How a wenche was suddenly healed of many soars.
WAlter Gilton glasier and Marie de In Aug. 1^03.
Rau^schot his wife, burge^^s and inhabitants of the City of Louaine had
amongst other children a daughter of thirteen years of age, called Catharin,
which child in the year 1600. fell into an infirmity and disease which is
commonly called the kings evil, or the evil of S. Marcoul, Because that saint
in France does he^^e this disease in such as at his tomb comme^d them selves
to his holy intercessi^
which broke out into more then an hundred holes, running with matter down all
her body, hands, arms, neck, face, eyes, belly, legs and feet, before and
behynd and on every ^yd: and her mouth was swollen as big as three mouths,
and in like manner was her nose and all her face, and her eyes were so swollen
and full of pain, that she was scarce able to see: and she became so weak that
she could not live, and yet she could not die: being sometimes in such pitiful
sort afflicted, that for the space of three months she could not stir out of
her bed, neither could she move either hand or foot: and further more when so
ever she rose up out of her bed, she could not go one step without the help of
a staff. To remedy which disease, her parents used the advice and Counsel of
many Doctors of Physic, and Surgeons, who had prescribed her many drincks and
drugges, but ^ll was to no purpose or prosit at all. Afterward an other very
skilful and famous Surgeon dwelling in that City of L^^^i^^ called M. Rombold
walters, being much commended unto the^, they couenaunted with him for a
certain so^me of money, that he would take in hand to cure their daughter,
wherein he took great pains, visiting and employing his labor and skill about
her, twyse every day, for six months space, and yet for all this could he not
obtain his desired purpos. These things having thus continued for the space of
three years, and this poor* Catharin having hard report of the miracles of
our Lady at Montaigu, and amongst others how a certain lame woman was there
cured: she importuned her parents, that they would vouchesafe to go with her
unto that place of pilgrimage: to which her request they yielded, and promised
they would so do: and where as her father intended to carry her on his back the
child would not permit that, but rather resolved to go thither her self on
soot, saying that she would force her self thereunto: and she hoped that she
should perform that voyage on foot, and so upon the second of August 1603.
they made the^ selves reddie for their journey, and they put on their daughter
a clean smock, taking from her that which she had worn, the which (be it
written with reverence to the reader) was stif with the filth and matter* which
did yslue out of the soars of her body: and putting a staff in her hand,
after they had dyned they deparfrom L^^ame, having in their company ^^^^^
C^^ema^s and his wife, Martin L^^^^^^ and others of their neighbors: and that
night they went and lodged at a village called T^ielt, with is distant some
three miles from the foresaid City, having much stayed by the way, by reason
of the great difficulty the said wench had to go. The next day in the morning
notwithstanding that it rained (which was very troublesome to the patient)
they took their way forwards toward Montaigu, where they arrived before
midday, and there did their devotion at the Chapel of our Lady, from the time
of their arriual til after dinner, and there offered up a child made in wax:
and having continued their prayers for one hours space, they retired
themselves into a booth or cottage hard by, and there reposed themselves,
expecting til the rain (which still continued) would cease: but when they saw
it ceased not, they all set forwards on foot with the little maid, to return
home again. In which their return the patie^t (although she had alredie gone
so much that day) walked with better courage, then she had done before, whereat
all those of her company were much astonished, and the said patient passed on
her way singing sometimes certain sonnets which the children of her years are
wount ordinarily to sing. And being now come within half a mile of L^uai^e the
Father seeing his daughter to wax somewhat werie, he carried her on his back
until he came to the city gates: and so soon as they were at home, the mother
put the child into her bed as she was accustomed to do: and she passed that
night very quietly, but the next morning the maid arose and put on her apparel
without any help, and came down, and told her mother that she had no filth or
matter on her smock, and that she felt no grief at all in her body, but that
she found her self wholly cured. Whereupon her Father and Mother searched her
with all diligence, and found her smock fair and clean, without any spotts at
all, and which was more, they found al her sores, which were very many to be
wholly cured and shut up, and especially on her belly (where her grief was
greatest before) and that all was strong and quite gone: yea leaving very few
scares behynd: in such sort that her mother finding her thus cured made no
difficulte to let her ly that very night following with the rest of her
Children who were well in health: the which for three yeare^ before she durst
never have permitted. After this she remained whole and well, not troubled with
any grief in the world and so she continues even to this present day. And
since her cure she has been twice at Montaigue, once on foot, and another time
by wagon, to render thancks to God and his glorious Mother for so great and
singular a benefit. All this that has been said, was affirmed and auerred by
both the parents of the child, before the Magistrates of the said city of
Lo^ain, upon the xxvjth. of June in the year 1604, and upon the self same day
the above named next neighbors of the foresaid walter Gilton, made their
appare^ce before the said Magistrates, who did in semblable manner affirm and
declare, that they had sundry times seen the foresaid wench, both before and
after her Pilgrimage to Montaigu: and that before she was in the a foresaid
evil case, and that afterward she miraculously and perfectly was cured, as
has been said. As it appears by the attestation of the aforesaid Magistrates
and dated as above, subsigned R. le Prince, and sealed with the seal of the
same city.

How a man whose legs were eaten with the canker was healed.
HEnry Loye^ alias de Visschere being of In Aug. 1603.
75 years of age, dwelling in the Village of Rerthem, near to the City of
Lo^ain had about midsomer 1603. his legs and feet so grievously swollen, that he
could put on no shoes, the pain was so excessive which he endured: and in the
month of Iulte in the same year there burst out in each of his legs a hole
near to the ancle and instep of the foot: the which holes within eight days
grew so bad, and became so large and deep, that on the one side a man might put
in his three fingers, and on the other side there was dead flesh of the length
of ones finger: and the patient affirmed that he felt such pain thereof, as if
it had bin g^awn by dogs. The which some judged to be the ca^ker, for that
the edges of the wounds were full of dead black flesh: and that from the bottom
the blood always issued out with so terrible a stentche, that no creature was
able to endure it: and as they perceived that the poor patient found no help by
any thing that he applied, he was counseled by some person, to go and visit our
Lady at Montaigu: which he promised and vowed to do, in hope there to receive
some consolation, and he never left to proceed in his intent, until he was
carried thither: but for so much a^ he was so sick and weak, none durst take the
matter upon them, except he were first put in the state of grace, for fear
least he should have dyed in the way as he went. The which thing after the
patient had understood, he caused himself to be carried to the Church of
B^rthem, where he made his confession, and communicated, the blood running from
him by the way as he went. And a few days after, to wit upon the fifth of
August in the aforesaid year 1603. he made himself to be carried in a wagon
unto Montaigu, where at our Ladies Chapel he did his devotion: and a certain
Priest that then was there, cou^seled him that he should make twice more that
voyage, and that for this purpose he should make choice of the Friday, and that
he should have a good confidence in the assistance of the Mother of God. The
patie^t being returned home he found his legs much lesser and vnswolne, and
the pain thereof much more tolerable then before. Whereupon following the
Counsel that was given him, he returned again the second time by waggo^ to
Montaigu, upon the feast of the Assumption of our Lady: and after he had ended
his prayers, he found much more ease then before. And upon the next friday,
being the xxij of the same month, he was brought thither the third time, and
did his devotions as before, and having at every of these times been led thrice
about the Chapel, not without effusion of his blood, which ran from his
legs upon the earth, together with a very great stenche as diverse of Montaigu
reported, who then were present. And from thence being come home, he fell into
so great weakness and such a swouning that every one thought he should have
forth with given up his ghost: the which being over passed he affirmed that
he felt a great and notable amendment of his legs and after that day the two
great wounds in his legs were by little and little cured and filled up of
themselves, and all the dead and corrupt flesh became good. So as the same
patient remains cured even at this present, having nothing le^t him but the
scarres of the soars, which are each of the^ of a span in greatness. All which
is well known by an authentical attestatio^ made before the Curate, Maier and
Escheuins, of the said village of Berche^, upon the xxij. of February 1604.

The healing of a bunche.
SIster B^trice Ieroo^s a lay sister professed In Aug. 1603.
in the Cloister of S. Vrsula or of the eleven thousand Virgins, in a place
called the Halfstreet in the City of Louain^ In this monaste rye a ver ^^ous
and venerable co^^^^nie of English gen^^evvomen ^^e profested.
contracted upon the year^ 160^. a certain accident, betwixt the right pap and
her shoulder before, which was a kind of bunch that happened her (as she
thought) by continual casting her arms, in throwing of water with a wooden
dish upon l^nnen, which they are wou^t to bleache in that Cloister: which bunch
was as great as ones fist, and it was not fleshy or soft, but rather stiff and
hard as a bone, which grew (as it seemed unto her) even out of the shoulder
bone, yet not having any different color from the other parts of her body,
neither was it any whit paineful, but only when she pressed it, and then
somtymes it happened that she cast blood out of her mouth The which she
sustained (without applying any remedy thereunto) about one year and a half.
But when she had heard of the miracles which were done at Moutaigu by the
invocation of our lady, she began to have a desire to go thither in
pilgrimage, and to pray that she might be cured, much confiding that the
glorious Virgin would assist her herein. And hereupo^ having obtained license
of her Superior she took her voyage to the said Mo^taigu, in the beginning of
August 1603. where she did her devotion in the Chapel of our Lady, from
thence she went to lodge at Sichen, which is distant a little half duitche mile
from that place, where she perceived that her accident began to wax better: and
the next morning returning to Montaigu, whiles she was there at her prayers,
she felt certain stretchings and straynings from her head to her right arm,
and toward the place where her bunch did grow: but being that day returned to
Louaine, the next morning as she arose she found ^^r accide^t wholly cured and
the bunch to have become of the-same ^^e^nes with the other parts of her
body, so that there was no difference thereby at al, and from that time she
has re^^ained without all pain or whatsoever accide^t, as the said Religious
woman avouched in the presence of her Mother or superior and others of the
said Convent, unto whom the evil which the-sayd sister sustained, and from
which she was now freed, was well known: and likewise in the presence of the
Venerable Fathers in God sir James van Ghele Priest and Doctor of Divinity,
and Sir James de Bee^ d'Oesterwijck, also Bacheler in Divinity, and Religions
in the Convent of the Iacobins in Louain and of M. Roland l^ Prince: Secretary
of the said City, upon the xxviijth. of October 1603. and upon the vjth. of
January 1604, according to an act that by the said Secretary le Prince was
framed hereof,

How a man that was sick of the falling evil was cured.
MAtia Pacgen son of Gaspar Pacgen ^n Aug. 1603.
of Herbagh borne at S. Lauren^berg in Cuntrie of Iuliers, near unto,
Ald^n-ho^^^, came unto Montaigu in the beginning of August 1603. to make there
his petition to our Lady, that by her intercession he might be freed from the
disease and infirmity of the falling sickness, wherewith for seven years past
he had been troubled, for that he had understood that our Lord did many
miracles at the invocation of his holy Mother in that place. And so remaining
some eight or te^ days at the said Mountain, he made his prayers deuoutely
before the Chapel of our Lady: during which time he was assailed six or seven
times every da^ (as accustomarily he was wount to have been) with three sorts
or kinds of the falling evil: with such a rage and vehemency, with such
knocks hurling and cries, that every one thought he would have been burst, or
that he should have dyed, which was a most pitiful sight unto all the Pilgrims
that were there present: who also endeavored by their prayers and alms to
obtain of God his cure and amendment. And upon the eve of the Assumption of
our Lady in the said month of August, this Mathias perseuering in his prayers
and devotions, found himself in perfect health and quyte delivered from all
these maladies: in such sort that the next day every one might manifestly see,
that not only he was delivered from his falling sickness, but that there
withal he had recovered a fair and lively color in his face, which before
was very dead and pale, and his bo^^e much swollen, as many who had seen him at
Montaigu while he had his disease, and afterward when he was healed, affirmed.
Thus the said Mathi^s returned in good plight to his hows by Alden^^uen. And in
the beginning of February in the year 1604. he repaired an other time to
Montaigu, to render tha^cks unto God and his glorious Mother for the benefit
which he had there obtained, wherewith at yet he continues most certain and
assured. Afterward (to wit, upon the xiiij. of the said month) he returned
thither once again, and brought with him the attestation concerning his
maladies given him by the Curace of Alden^ ^uen, and also by the Magistrates of
the Imperial City of ^ken, dated upon the xviij. of the aforesaid month of
February, and subsigned Nicolaus Munsterus Secretary and sealed with the seal
of the same City.

Of a spice of Leprosy which was there cured.
Matthew Croisier son to Reynold Croisier In Aug. 1603.
dwelling in the town of Huy in the Cuntrie of Liege, being about twelve
years old, in the year 1603. became so full of scabbes and botches running
down along his body, that by the Curate and Curch-wardens of Saint Steuens
Parish in the same town, he was presented before the Magistrates of Huy, for a
leper, and hereupon they made him to be more diligently serched in the City of
Li^ge, to the end that if he were found a leper indeed they might provide for
him some necessary entertainment, and so to separate him from the company
and conversation of other men.

For which cause the Magistrates appointed that they should deliver him as from
the town, a bushel of corn for his food, until such time as they were fully
informed of his malady. In the mean while this youth was visited by M. Thomas
d'O^^^i^, and master Ni^^l^^ de (...) Surgeo^s of the said City, who found
him full of botches, scabbes, and deep sores, wherein he had no feeling at all:
and yet could they not certainly judge what evil it was: as appears by the
attestation of the-sayd Magistrates given under their s^al^ upon the xvij. of
Ia^uarie 1604. But the father of this youth having been in Pilgrimage at
Montaigu, and having seen and known the miracles which were there done by the
invocation of the glorious Virgin Marie, he caused his son to be brought
thither, in hope to find there some help for him, and this was about the
midst of August in the year 1603. Now as the youth was carried round about
the Chapel of our lady he began to cry out, that he was burned within his
body, and after they had ended their devotions, they carried him in-to a booth
or cottage hard by, where he rested very quietly that night, and in the morning
they found some of his botches healed, and all his soars and holes shut up,
and continuing there his denotions, within two or three days all his other
soare^ and botches of his body were ^^red of themselves, nothing remaining
but certain red spots as large as half a philip daller, and those were to
the number of forty or fifty. Moreover this youth was broken in such sort,
that his secret parts were swollen as big as both ones fi^ts: of which rupture
he was also cured at that time, without any human help or assistance: and
here of many persons of credit who were then at Montaigu do bear good
testimony, and namely M. James de Castr^ Doctor of di^initie, Archpriest or
dean of the Christianity in Die, Sir John Ha^egreaf Curate of Testel^,
Master Io^chim B^scher Secretary of the Counsel of Brab^^^, Peter de Ham
Notarie, residing at Die, and John Baptist Zangre sworn Printer in the City
of Lou^in^, of which persons some visited the young ma^n^s naked body, and
considered the perfection of his said cure, with the s^a^res that remained. And
the same young man coming afterward to Bruxelles, was visited by a skilful
Surgeon, and found whole, and quyte delivered of his rupture, and from all
other diseases whatsoever.

How a man bruised with a fall was cured.
COr^eli^s Fex inhabitant of the town In Aug. 160^.
of Die one day going about his affairs, and passing betwixt the villages of
(...) and M^^r^eke by Die, happened to stumble and to fall upon a stump of
wood lying in the way: so that he in^ardly grieuouselie hurt himself in his
b^east, and for the s^ace of ^ix whole weeks was grievously ^ick thereof, and
after he had used the help of a Surgean, who had applied diverse remedies and
ointments about him, yet found he no ame^dment at all: where upon ^e purposed
to go and vi^it our Lady at Montaigu, where in August 1603. having do^ne his
devotion and washed his breast with a certain water which is in the said
mountain, he was immediately delivered from all his p^i^^^ and griefs, and
never after felt any of the^. And all this was solemnly sworn (...) a^ouched
by the foresaid Cornelius before the Magistrates of Die. upon the XXth* of
March in the year 1604. and an I^str^ment was formed and made thereof ^^^
signed I. ^^^^ ^n G^^d^^-h^is^ and sealed with the seal of the aforesaid town.

The Palsy Cured.
LEonard Tee^ers dwelling at Beri^gen in In Aug. 160^.
the Cuntry of Li^ge was sick of the Palsy, and so taken in all his limbs,
that he could move none of them, but only his head and tongue: the which
having continued thus a year and a half, fynding no help in any of the
receiptes or medicines which were employed for his ^ure, and being at the
length advertised of the miracles which were wrought at Montaigu, he resolved
to cause himself to be carried thither, having great confidence to find some
help by the ^ntercession of the glorious Virgin Ma^ie. The which he performed,
and was carried thither in a wagon wherein he was to be taken up and laid down
even as a very infant: when he had finished his devotion at the chapel of our
Lady, he caused himself to be carried home back again, in the same wagon,
without perceiving as ^et any amendment, but some two or three days after, he
began to move his limbs and to creep upon his hands and feet about the how^.
An other time after that he had a great desire to go again to visit our Lady
at Mo^taigu wherefore he caused a wago^ to be prepared for him, and he had now
recovered so much strength that he could go from his hows to the place where
the wagon was, and having the second time do^ne his devotion unto our Lady, he
obtained so much ease, that he left there one of his crutches, and with the
other and the help of the wagon he returned home, in better disposition, and
with more force then he had before. But fifteen days after he came thither
again the third time, and walked thither on foot only with one crutch and
seiour^ed at Montaigu for the space of fifteen days, doing there his daily
devotions: and returned home again with his crutch, but with more strength and
in better health and disposition of his body then the two times before: and
since he has every day found more ease and amendment. All this that has here
been said this Leonard Pee^ers declared and testyfied upon the xvth of August
1604. in the presence of Sir Godfrey of Thi^nwinkele Curate of Sichen, Sir John
Rosa Prior of the Iacobins in Loua^^e and Licentiate in Divinity, Brother
William Sil^ius procurator of the same Convent, Master Anthony Bouckhout
Maier of Sichen and John Baptist Zangre Printer: as also afterward he avouched
the same under his oath solemly made before the Eschoutet, Maier and Escheuins
of the aforesaid town of Beringen, as it may be seen by their attestation
sealed with their seal, and subsigned Heuricus Cillemus secretary.

The Healing of a certain disease called the Scurutes.
Elizabeth Vander Hoeuen wife unto In Aug. 1^0^.
Zacharias van A^roy, dwelling in the village of Grasen near to Bets in the
territory of Die, was in the lent 1603. taken with an accide^t and malady
which bred great pricki^gs in every part of her body, together with many black
spots of the bigness of a phillip daler whereby she became no^ only so weak
and impotent that she could do no manner of work but, more over she had such
vehement pain that she could rest neither night nor day so that she did
nothing but run out of her bed and presently run thither back again, as if
she had been deprived of her wits: yet called she continually upon the name
of the blessed Virgin Marie, to the end she would pray for her in this her
affliction: which continued until August, in the said year of our Lord 1603.
And then having hard some speak of the miracles which were wrought at Montaigu,
by the intercession of the Mother of God, she devoutly resolved to make a
pilgrimage to that place, the which she performed* and praying at the Chapel
of our Lady, immediately as she had ended her prayers, she felt a great
amendment, and that the foresaid prickings and stingings ceased: and from that
time forwards she began to be better: whereupon she was moved to return again
unto Montaigu to render thancks to the Virgin Marie, for the help she received
by her means, after which journey (being very soon after the other) the same
Elizabe^^ went home in perfect health and strength, and became so strong and
able of body, in so much as she affirmed that she never felt her self better
in all her life. According to her attestation of all the premises which
iuridicallie passed before the Eschoutet and men of law of the foresaid
Lordship of Grasen upon the thirteenth of March 1604.

How a maid was healed of her legs that were swollen and full of pain.
MArtha Vander Tay being of two and In Aug. 26 0^.
forty years of age, maid servant in the hows of M. John Va^den Petre Clarck
in the Counsel of Brabant in Bruxelles: had a disease and accide^t in her
legs, which hapened her in the year 1603, whereby they became very great and
swollen, and so full of ache that she could do no kind of labor, yea she could
not so much as go without extreme grief and shedding of tears, neither could
she repose in the night through the veheme^cie of her pain which never
stinted: but continued for the space of more then three months. Her Master
being desirous to help her, ^sed the counsel of a certain Physician dwelling
in the said City, and afterward of certain other men and women practitioners
in physic: and they appointed her a number of diverse receip^o^, as of bathes,
fomentations, ointments and other such like, but all in vain and without any
help at all. Whereupon her said master (seeing her past hope to be cured, and
that if she were cu^t she should remain a cripple, and miserable all the
residue of her life, as not able any ways to gain her living) entered into a
deliberation to place her and to provide for her in some Hospital, where she
might be maintained. But when the fame of the miracles of our Lady at Montaigu
began to be bruited abroad, he resolved at the last to send her thither, hoping
that there she might be helped. And so about mid August she was sent by wagon
to a Cloister called Te^Ba^ck near to the City of Lo^^in, wherein a sister of
the said Clark lived: and from thence also by wagon she was conveyed to Die,
that the next morning after she might go to Montaigu. In which voyage this
Martha began already to find some ease in her legs. Having rested one night in
Die, she made her self ready in the morning to go on foot unto Montaigu,
but it seemed unto her a thing impossible, and so she stood in a doubt what she
might do: which when the wife of the hows where she lodged perceived, she bad
her be of good courage, and exhorted her to go not only on foot, but barefoot
also, for that there was but one good mile to the place, which seemed unto the
said Martha a thing altogether out of her power: not withstanding being much
animated by the woman exhortation, and with the hope which she gave her that
the Mother of God would not permit her to return without comfort, on she se^^
forward barefoot, and as she went, she bega^to feel that her legs waxed
better and better. And being arrived at our Ladies chapel whylst she was at
her prayers, she felt all the swelling and pains of her legs and feet to
cease and quite to be go^, even as if one should feel some thing to be untied
and loosed which before was bound and made fast: and when her prayers were
ended she returned again barefoot unto Die, being whole and maruelously
comforted: and from Die by wagon she went back to Louain, and so to
Bruxelles fynding herself very well in all her body, as she is now even at this
present. And all this that here has been set down, was verified and avouched by
herself, under her oath solemnly made before those of the law in the said City
of Bruxelles, upon the xxvith* of April 1604. as may be seen by their
attestation given hereof, subsigned Numan, and scaled with the said Cities
seal.

A marvelous cure of an incurable wound.
LEonard Stock^^an born at S. Georges, in In Sept. 160^.
the territory of the town of H^y in the country of Liege, about some fourteen
year ago as he trauayled one day through the forest of Seign^ near to a village
called ^aterl^^s not far from Bruxelles, was assailed by a thief and murderer:
who handled him so cruelly, and gave him so many wounds, that he left him for
dead in the place: and amongst others he gave him a gash on the left hamme, in
such sort that he cut in sunder his sinews, and it passed even to the bone.
In this case was he brought to an Hospital in Bruxelles, that there he might be
seen unto: and within a certain time al his wounds were healed save that of
his hamme, the which because the sinews were cut, every one esteemed as
incurable, wherefore being dismissed out of the Hospital he was forced to go
with two crutches: yet through the abundance of humors, which somtymes had
thither their course there ensued many new sores and issues round about the
principal wound: and although he used diverse medicines of certain Physicians,
yea and had performed diverse pilgrimages, yet he found no help at all. At the
last in the month of September 1603. he went to visit our ladies at Montaigu:
where having continued nine days, and daily washing his sores with a certain
water that is in that mountain not far from the chapel, he found that the
lesser sores cured of themselves, and when the nine days were expired, he
perceived that the cut and interessed sinews of his leg, were grown and made
fast within to the bone of his said leg, and that they were round about covered
with flesh, and ^^ew skin: yet the place of the great wound remained hollow,
and with so great a hole, that one might easily put his fist therein. And thus
this Loonard was perfectly cured, without any impediment or grief, walking,
going and assisting himself, with the said leg even as he himself pleased, and
as any other man that is whole and sound might do: having afterward made on
foot the way betwixt Montaigu and Louain, which is du^tche ^iles.
five good long miles, and this he did in the month of October next following.
All which the said Stockneau declared and affirmed under a so emn oath which he
made before the Curate Ma^er and Escheuins of Siclen the xxith. of April, 1604.
according to an instrument ^ormed thereof, signed ^. ^an Ogernen Secretary,
and sealed with the seal of the said town.

How an old man was cured of the falling evil.
G^les Libens being seventy years of age dwelling at Attenhouen by the In
Sept. 160^.
town of Landen in Bra^ant, was ^exed with the falling ^uil above fifty years
together, and he was torm^^ted therewith especially upon Sundays and
Hollydayes, having but little ease of it upon other days. This aged man being
moved by the miracles wrought at Mo^taigu, purposed with himself to go thither
in Pilgrimage, and there to entreat the blessed Virgin to obtain for him that
he might be healed: the which he performed upon the seventh of September in the
foresaid year 1603. and having there finished his devotions, he returned whole
and in good plight, without ever after feeling any molestation thereof: as he
affirmed before the Maier and Escheuins of the said Lordship of Attehouen upon
the xxijth. of March, in the year 1604. and an instrument was drawn thereof,
subsigned Nicolaus Nicola^ Secretary, and sealed with the seal of the said
Lordship.

How a man was healed of a rupture
John Hagels Carpe^ter dwelling at Ade^oort In Sept. 1603.
by Heylihsem, near Tilem^nt, in Brabant, being threescore and four years
old, in the year 1602, and in the month of August travailing in reaping of
corn in the fields between the villages of w^nde and Rai^s^^uen, found that he
was inwardly built by overmuch labor: whereupon ensued a very great and
excessive pain; which continued a whole year, notwithstanding that he had
aplied many remedies in vain, at the last having hard of the miracles of our
Lady at Montaigv, and how by her intercession diverse had been healed of the
like accident, he went thither with great devotion and confidence, upon the
eight of September 1603, being the feast of the Na^iuit^e of our lady, and
having made his prayers at the Chapel, he found much ease of his pain, for
which cause within some weeks after he returned twice thither again, and at
the third time he found himself perfectly cured of his Rupture: and leaving
there his trusse wherewith he was accustomed to ty hiself, he never after felt
a^^ the least pain or hinderance thereby. As under his sole^n oath he avouched
(being summoned thereunto before the Curate, Maier and Escheuins of the Vilage
of Neder heylighse^, upon the eleventh of February 1604. according to their
attestation subsigned Seruatius Rosi^s Curate, G^^^la^^^e van Meeusele Maier,
and G. Persoo^s Secretary, and sealed with the seal of the said Village.

The Curing of diverse accidents.
Master Francis Eland Curate of the In Sept. 160^.
Church called the Chappelle de nostre Dame in the City of Bruxelles, was much
troubled with a flux of the Hemorhoides commonly called in French les brochet
which he had long time endured. Besides this he was Astmaticque, that is to say
much stratened in his breast, and short breathed, in so much as every one
thought he could never recover, notwithstanding that he ordinarily used the
counsel of sundry physicians: who can well witness, how that within one we^k he
lost above thirty ounces of blood. The which disease continuing thus for
diverse years, there followed upon it a great swelling in his feet and legs
like unto a dropsy, and this continued for four years together,
notwithstanding that many remedies were used about him, as bathes,
fomentations, ointments, and other such like, so that he fell into such an
infirmity and weakness, (being now come to the threescore and three year of
his age) that the Physicians despaired of his health and life: having so lost
his speech and memory, that they thought he should never recover the due use
of his speech so long as he lived: and this they held as assured, that at
leastwise he would never be fit to execute his office of Pastorship again,
Wherefore at last he resolved to goc and entreat our Lady at Mo^taigu for his
health and so he caused him self to be carried thither in September 1603. where
having done his devotions, and returning back toward Bruxelles, he felt a
certain kind of itching or biting, and alteration in his legs, and besides
this, a new strength and ease in his sinews: and being come home, he found
that all the former swelling in his feet and legs was gone, in such sort,
that from that time he has used no further remedies, ointments, or receiptes,
fynding himself also free from all his other accidents as well of the
Hemor^^ides, as of the debilitie and impotencie into which he was fallne: yea
he had gaigned so good a stomak, and is become so lively, in so much as he
avouches and affirms that ^ow being threescore and lower years old he
feels himself more strong and ab^e, the^ he was at the age of for^^e or
^^^tie, the which he also approoueth by his outward carriage, perfourming
again his office of pastorship more lively and dexterously then ever he did
before. And all this (as he acknowledges and affirms) by the intercession
and assistance of the glorious Virgin Marie. As of all the premises he has
given a sufficient attestation, written by his own hand in memory of the
benefit which God bestowed upon him.

How an old man was healed of a great rupture
DAniel Smith Sextane of the parish church of the town of Viluord, near unto
Bruxelles, being threescore and seven years old, was some twenty years
before broken on the right side of his belly, as big as both ones fistes, which
happened as he thought by ri^ging the belles of that Church. For the remedying
whereof, he did onlie^ty himself with a trusse, made fit for the purpose: yet
for all that he felt very often such vehement pain, that he thought he should
have lost his senses, and in this manner he went up and down with great
difficulty. But about the month of August 160^, he was seized upon with a
long and grievous disease, where by he thought he should fall into a dropfie
being very feeble, having no appetite to his meat, and unable to do any thing
without great pain and travail, which continued a whole month space. In
which time his wife having hard talk of the miracles which by the intercession
of our Lady were wrought at Montaigu, she resolved to go thither, and to pray
there for her husbands recovery, or at least for the mittigatio^ of his
pains, and especially of his Rupture, where with he was so cruelly tormented:
the which she performed not long after. Being the^ come to Montaigu, upon an
evening at the time of Salve, this Daniel being in the Church at Viluord, told
certain persons that were near unto him, that he felt himself at that very
time much eased of his malladie, which had continued now a whole month as has
been said: and that ^e felt in himself an appetit to his meat, the which he
never had all the time before: And from that instant his disease left him, so
as he was no more therewith troubled afterward. But his wife beeig returned
from Montaigu, he enquired of her at what time and hour she did her devotion
at the Chapel of our Lady, and he vncerstood that it was in the evening about
five of the clock, at the same time and instant that he found himself ^ased of
his disease as we have said. And about the midst of September the said Daniel
determined in like manner to go unto Montaigu, partly for devotion, and partly
to give thancks unto God and his most holy Mother, for the favor he had already
obtained: and after this his determination (although it was three days before
he took his ^or^ey) he found himself so much eased and amended of his Rupture,
that to him it seemed in a manner cured. Finally departing from Viluord, in the
co^pagnie of others of these me town, who were also to go to Mountao^e, not
wearing any trusse as he was accustomed, and there having made his prayers to
our Lady, in returning home on foot, found himself very lust^e, not feeling
any pain or impediment by his Rupture, either in going or coming, but rather
^ase and help: and being returned home, he found himself not only perfectly
helped, but in so good a plight and disposition of body, as if he were twenty
years younger then he was, in such sort that ever since he has remained free
of all grief and pain, and although he used no trusse, yet his Rupture never
appeared. All these things the said Daniel and his wife have sole^nly avouched
under their oaths, before the Escheuins of Viluord, upon the xxijth of April
1604. as it appears by the informations taken thereof, and signed, ^. Gh^^ris
secretary of the same town.

An admirable cure of diverse running sores
Mistress Martha de Rosenberge, daughter In Sept. 160^.
unto the Lord Maximilian Baron of Rosenberge, in St^ria, widow unto M.
Mathias Wo^tzelman, sometime Captain of a company of foot, in the service of
his catholic majesty in the low cu^tries, induced for two years space a
great accide^t in her right leg, wherein there were three open soars, which
occupied her whole thigh, from the very top thereof to her knee, half an el in
length, and a quarter in breadth, as appeared by the plasters which she was
wount to apply thereu^to. Betwixt each of the sores there were twelve holes or
issues, which proceeded of certain cold and sharp humors, that descended
thither from her head: all which happened through the misery and poverty
which she endured, while she labored in the court of Bruxels, for payment of
such monny as was due unto her husband for his service. For the curing of these
soars she had taken the counsel of diverse, together with diverse remedies which
sundry particular persons had prescribed her, without maki^g her case known
to any Physician or Surgeon, and this upon too much shame and bashfulnes that
withheld her. But when she saw that all which she did profited her nothing, she
was in fine constrained to put her self into the hands of some skilful
Physician or Surgeon, for the recovery of her desired health, and thereupon she
entreated M. Peter Paulson a germane surgeon, and one of the guard to our most
gracious Prince and Sovereign the Archduke Albertus, to help her: who took upon
him to cure her, and for this purpose let her blood three or four times, and
withal gave her a purgation, and took her into his hows the better to
administer unto her there the diet: applyi^g to her soars all the remedies
which according to the art of surgerie he was able to invent: yet could he for
all his labor effectuate nothing, but only that her pains were somewhat
appeased, and sometimes her soars were shut up, but they continued so not past
a day or two, for forth with they broke out again as before, and could never
be consolidated or strengthened. But at last this gentlewoman having hard in
Bruxelles, of the miracles which were daily wrought by the invocation of the
Virgin Marie at Montaigu, she had a great desire to go thither upon devotion,
with hope and trust, that our Lady would procure her her health: and the same
night after that she had made this determination betwixt waking and sleeping,
it seemed unto her that she saw the Image of our Lady of Montaigu, with the
wood that grew thereabout, and she felt as it were an inward motion and
incourageme^t to make the foresaid voyage. Whereupon the next morning following
(which was the xxijth. of September 1603.) she beseeched our Lady that she
might find some that would accompany her to Montaigu. And afterward going to
the hows of M. Anne de la Croix her gossip who somedayes before had talked with
her about her going to our Ladies, she inquired of her when she purposed to
depart: unto whom the other answered, tha^ she intended to go even that very
day: whereof this Gentlewoman Mistress Martha was very glad, and so went with
the said Anne de la Croix to hear mass in the Church of S. Gudula in
Bruxelles, and soon after they set on forewards in their way toward Louain,
and the day following toward Montaigu In the way the said Mistress Martha felt
so great pain in her leg, and with all she became so weary, that she thought
she should never come to the Chapel notwithstanding taking a good courage she
went on so well, that she came to a certain pathway where (the direct way to
Die being left) people use to turn on the left hand toward Montaigu, into
which way so soon as they were entered she perceived the pain (which she
sustained from the top of her head all alo^g her sore leg) to decrease, and by
little and little to leave her, and that all her wearines surceased therewith:
and so being arrived at the chapel of our lady, they made there their
prayers: afterward having rested and warmed them selves in a little hows
thereby, they settled them selves that night again to their prayers, at which
time this M. Martha began to feel herself much better, and without pain:
whereupon (having felt this alteration) she looked upon her leg, and she
perceived that her soars began to wax whole, in such sort that taking away
the clothes and plasters which were applied thereunto, she put them into her
mau^d: and the next day those that had seen her the day before affirmed, that
they perceived her to be much altered and amended, both in her color and
countenance. And the same day (after she had given tha^cks to God and his holy
mother) they returned to Bruxelles, she feeling in her way the increase of her
force and health: and when she was come home she found no more but one ho^e or
issue in her leg, the which some two days after was peffectly shut up of it
self: in such sort, that since that time she has not only inioyed intiere
and perfect cure of her leg, but also she has found a great force and strength
in all the interior and exterior parts of her body: and the places of the
soars where the flesh was eaten away and consumed, were restored and filled up
again with new flesh. And all this which here has bin set down, the foresaid
M. Martha declared, and under her o^he solemnly avouched, before the
Magistrates of the said City of Bruxelles, upon the xvith day of October 1603.
Before whom also M. Peter Paulsonne appeared, who being examined of the
premises, he likewise affirmed under his o^he* that he had the said M stresse
Martha in hand seven or eight Months continually, to cure her of her disease
before specified, and what industry he had used, as well by blood-letting
purging, diet* as other ways* according to the art of surgerie: and that he
compassed no other thing thereby* but to assuage in some sort the grief of her
great sore, and of the other yssues that were about it, and that somtymes he
had shut them up for a day or twain, and yet that they afterward opened
again, by reason of the continual defluxions that descended thither: which
sores yielded so great and terrible a stench, that often times it forced his
wife to swoune. And that after this M^^tresse Martha was returned from
Montaigu, he having hard that she was perfectly cured, was much amazed thereat:
and thereupon would needs see and visit hersayd sores, and the places that
were annoyed, and found that verily all the holes, yssues, and sores were
perfectly healed up* and that those parts where the flesh was eaten away and
consumed, were filled up again with flesh, and made aequal, and that only
certain spots and scarres remained afterward. The which the said M. Peter
Paulsonne (considering the greatness of the sore, together with the multitude of
the running issues and their sudaine cure) thought could never naturaly or by
any human means be brought to ^a^, but only by the allmighty hand of God.
All which may be seen by the attestation of thesayd Magistrates, sealed with the
seal of the said City of Bruxelles, and and subsigned P. Numan Secretary.

An Admirable cure of a person betwitched, In Sept. 160^.
and sore grieved with the bloody fl^xe,
MAgdale^ Pre^dh^mme widow of Baudec^on Alart, being about the age of
threescore years, dwelling in the City of Bruxelles, by trade a seller of old
garments, went together with her daughter at the time of harvest in the year
1593. to a certain village near to Louaine called Be^them, to reap corn, for
that she understood that some profit was there to be made: and hereupon she
there fell to travail amongst diverse others. At which time it happened that a
certain husba^dman dwelling in that village* desired her to have an eye that
none took any of his corn, which he had lying upon a piece of land thereby. But
she having perceived that a woman of that village was so hardy as to take some
of his corn, this Magdalen advertised him thereof: who going to the woman's
hows took away his corn thence by force, and in spyte of her brought it home to
his own hows, although she was meruelousely a^gry there with. The next day they
being met again in the field, this woman rebuked the said Magdalen for that
she had accus^d her, saying that she would pay her home for it. At night she
returned to the Vilage, and lodged near to the hows of the foresaid woman, who
came and presented her with a trencher full of fried Roman beans, saying that
she had bin^ in a great collar with her, for that she had accused her, but it*
was now past and gone, and that she made no account thereof: and although this
Magdalen had no great appetit to her beans, yet she received them, and did
eat some f^w of them, and that night she ^e^ a certain grudge of an ag^^, but
that withheld her not from going the next day to l^bour in the field, as she
was wount to do before: where after she had been for some short time, she was
taken with a very great ache in her head, and she began so to whirle about her
body, as if she had bin out of her wits: in such sort, that at night of
force she must be conducted to the vilage, by the assistance of an other woman, where she was suddenly taken with a vehement and welnigh continual flux:
which when the inhabitants of the vilage had understood, they rebuked this
Magdalen for lodging so near the said woman, for so much as she was reported
to be a witch: whereof this Magdalen was not a little aston shed, and seeing
that she was not able to woork any longer, by reason of the grieuousenes of her
disease, she returned the next day fair and softly toward Bruxelles, where
she endured continually her said malady: notwithstanding having a good hope
that ^t would not long continue, she placed her self in the hows of one of her
acquaintance called Simon, dwelling near to the place of the Sablon in
Bruxelles, there to have care of his hows. But when th^^ flux would not cease,
she was constrained to depart from thence: which also in like manner happened
unto her in diverse other howses where she hired her logings to dwell in, and
much a do she had to find any harbor, because every one abhorred to admit so
fl^hie a creature into their howses, for that her disease continued long time
without any intermission, although she had used many remedies, both by the advice of a certain Doctor of Physic, as also of an other expert surgeon, who
was also very well seen in Physic, besides the counsels of very many other
particular persons, who had administered unto her diverse medicines, but all was
in vain and to no purpose. She having now sustained this for diverse years,
having every night and day ordinarily thirty or forty stools, she became
exceedingly weak and feeble, not knowing what counsel to take whereby to help
her self: well at last she remembering that the woman of Berthem which had given
her the beans was held for a witch, she therefore purposed to go unto her,
that she might take away from her the inchauntment (a thing wherein many now a
days very easily permit them selves to be abused) but it was told her by
those of the village, that not long after the same woman went from thence* and
that some had understood that she was afterward by order of justice executed
for sorcerie. Afterward it was repor ted, unto this Magdalen that near unto
the town of Hall in Henault there dwelled a certain man which took upon him to
help those that were be witched: where upon she went thither somtymes on foot,
somtymes being carried, but he having visited and examined her, told her that
her grief was incurable, and that she should continue in this sort all the
rest of her life: counseling her notwithstanding to make some offering to our
Lady at Hall and to wash her legs for some nine days with Aqua vitae, the
which she did, without any aid or help thereby, her said flux enduring still
night and day as before: whereby she became oftentimes so sick, that she was
forced to go with crutches, and sometimes in her hows she crept upon all four,
and for a years space she voyded in her stools clear blood. At length she was
advised to seek unto a cer tain woman dwelling in Bruxelles, near unto the
Court, who was skilful in administering certain herbs against sorcerie. Who
going and declaring unto her her necessity, the said woman gave her to drink
certain spoonfulles of wine, with certain stamped herbs, and with this she
returning to her lodging, and coming here to the Cloister of the Capuchines,
where she dwelt at that time, she felt her self very ill and (be it spoken with
reverence) she cast forth by way of vomiting eight little beasts, like unto
myce new littered, having tails and very little hair on their backs, and being
alive. And a day or two after she took again of the former herbs, but then
she voyded nothing at all. Having at the third time received again the foresaid
drinck, she cast out two little beasts like unto fishes which live in the
water and are called millers thu^bes and withal three or four things like
other fishes, and finally a great worm like a little snake. After she was
delivered of this filth, she found her self a little eased about her heart, but
her flux never ceased either by night or by day so that (be it spoken with
reverence) she voided her meat even in such sort as she did eat it, without any
disgestion thereof at all: and so soon as she had eaten or drunk any thing were
it never so little* she was incontinently forced by siege to void it. In such
wise, that she was constrained to swathe her self as women are wount to do
their little children, that she might gayn her living by working in the houses
of some of her acquaintance, because the former passion never ceased or stayed.
And thus she continued with the said flux three or four years after she had
cast out of her body those things before mentioned, without applying any other
remedy, for well she found that she could not any ways be cured. At the last,
in the year 1603. after this flux had continued welnigh ten years, she was
advised by some of her friends to make a pilgrimage to our Lady at Montaigu,
in hope that there peradventure she might recover her health, seeing that many
others were at the same place miraculously cured. The which she determined to
do. But having understood that the wife of Gerard Monck trumpetour to the most
gracious Arc^duke Albertus and the said Gerards sister (who were of her
acquaintance) intended to go thither, she resolved to stay til they were
returned home again, that she might the better understand by them the manner
of the way and diverse other circumstances. They be^ing returned this Magdalen
went forth with to see them, and whereas the trumpeters sister had brought
home with her some of the wood of the oak, in the which in times past the
Image of our Lady was placed, she gave her a little piece thereof; counseling
her to put it in water, and to drinck it in honor of our Lady, and there
withal to put her confidence in God. But Magdalen taking the wood, went pre
sently to the Church called the Chapel of our Lady, which was not far from
thence, and these putting her self upon he knees before the altar of the Virgin
Marie, she began to gnaw and eat the foresaid piece of wood, deuoutely
beseeching the Mother of God that she would obtain for her her health, and so
soon as she had swallowed it, she found her self much eased, feeling in her
body a certain heavy gross matter to descend from her stomach down to the
left side of her belly. In that Church she continued in prayer till she had
heard one mass, and a part of an other, at which time she perceived that her
former passion ceased, being never after troubled with her accustomed flux,
but only that she felt the thing that sunck down into her belly to be hard,
and as great as the two fistes of a man, whereby being very much comforted,
she went too (...)h to aduertis the trompeter wy^e he^^of, declaring unto her
how she ^e ^^hers^^f abettered. And hereupon a day or ^^o after she made her
self ready to g(...) Pilgrimage to Montaigue, together with Derick vander
Sc^ure^ burges of thesare C^^e of Bruxels, with his wife, and a young maid, and
with Benedicta Henarick wy^e unto Hughe Noisei: and thus departing together
from Bruxelles, upon the eve of S Mat^ew in Septembre, in the foresaid year
^^^ 3. they went and lodged that night at ^^nain, the said Magdalen feeling
nothing of her former passion: and the next day they went forwards all on foot
to (...), and the more she went the better she ^^lt her self: but being now
come n^^^ the mountain, at a place where the g(...) a death, Magdalen began to
feel such v^h^me^t grypings in her belly, as though she ^^d been in the travail
of chyldbirth, in such sort that she was constrained to stay behynd* letting
the others go on, and no body remaining with her but her own daughter, and
the wife of the afores^^d Derick, and through the vehemency of the pain
holding up her self with her hands against a tree, she was delivered as it were
by way of chyldbirth of a skin or bladder as great as an ordinary pynt pott,
and it passed from her with a kind of noise or sound: the which bladder was
full of filthy matter, mixed with yelow, green, blew, and black, as they beheld
it, thrusting and breaking it with their feet and staves, where wi^h they
travailed. After that she was delivered of this burden, she felt her self
mcontinently much cased and comforted, inso much that she ran after the rest of
her company, who were now gone a good way before. They being all now come to
the chapel of our Lady, they prayed there a good while, and after they had
ended their devotions, they returned theself same day on foot, and came to a
place which was but one half mile distant from Louain: insomuch as the said
Magdalen had gone some ten duitch miles that day, without any pain or
hindrance at all by her former flux: and the next day returned to Bruxelles,
where ever since she has continued in as good health and disposit on of her
body as ever she was in all he^ life, and so she is even at this present. And
all th^s she has affirmed under her solemn oath (being diligently examined
thereof) before the Magistrates of the aforesaid city of Bruxelles on the
^yght of April 1604. and upon the twelfth of the same month the aforesaid
Derick vander Schuren and his wife made their appearance before thesayd
magistrates, who in like manner under their oaths declared and testined, that
some nine or ten years before they knew the said Magdalen, and that they
always held and esteemed her, and have hard that others also have reputed her
for an honest woman, and one worthy to be credited: and that in the time of
her former malady she had often complained unto them that she was bewitched,
and that she had cast up the myce and little fishes, and other such trash as
before has been declared. Moreover they said, that they knew how for some
eight or ten years she was continually aflicted with the flux: during which
time they had seen her often times very sick and weak, and that the color of
herface was very yellow and ugly to behold. And the wife of this Derick
declared that this Magdalen had made the voyage to our Ladies at Montaigu in
her company, in the company of her husband, and others before mentioned, and
she well remembered, that at such time as they aproched near the Mountain about
the place where the gibet st^ndeth, she complained of a pain which she felt in
her belly, and that she voyded in the same place a certain thing which she
would have showed unto her gossip, but she regarded it nothing, saying that it
was some ordure not worth the looking on, and so going toward the Mountain,
she well perceived that after she had been discharged of the foresaid filth she
walked on very merrily, and seemed more strong and in better disposition of
her body, then before: returning on foot the same day that they departed from
Louaine, to a place with-in half a mile of the-same City: and that ever since
she has remained in very good health. All which is to be seen by a public act
made thereof under the seal of the said City, of Bruxels, and subsigned P.
Numan.

with a great malady in the month of May 1602. wherewith he became so impotent
that he could move neither his arms nor legs, feet nor hands: and continued
thus keeping his bed for the space of three mon^ths and an half: but afterward
being somewhat recovered, he went a whole year (though with great difficulty)
upon crutches. In which time he hard talk of the miracles which were done at

in our Ladies Chapel, and finished his other devotions, he found his legs
and arms perfectly cured, and all his body in so good disposition and order
that there he left his cr^rches, and returned whole to his own hows without any

How a Religious woman that was two and forty years lame was cured.
MAistris Catharin Tserraerts daughter In Oct. 160^.
unto Sir Anthony Tserraerts, Lord of Hadoght, and of the Lady Anne de
Ba^le^court his wife, now Professed amongst the Religious women in the
monastery of the white Ladies in Louain, was lame of her left leg even from
her infancy: the which leg was five or six inches or an hand-bredth shorter
then the other: her ^uklebone was not in the right place but rather toward
her back, and made there such a buntch that one might well perceive it through
her clothes, the knee of that leg was crooked and pr^ssed inwardly against her
right th^ghe, in so much that she could not separate the one leg from the
other: moreover in regard of the shortness of the said left leg she was
constrained to wear a panto^^e or shoe vnderlayd under the heel with corck
some ^iue or six inches h^ghe, and for all this it came not to the ground, but
she went still upon her toes, as one might easily perceive by the upper lether
of her shoe that was full of wrinckles. And of this all her kinsfolks and
friends can bear witness, who have seen her in this sort, as also James
Ma^ck Sho^maker, who fitted her with shoes. Yea fur^her more all the Religious
of the foresaid convent of the white Ladies amongst whom she was professed
full seuenteen years, as she also was scholar amongst them, when she was but
eight years old. To help this accident her paren^es labored and spent much,
while she was in her tender age, in so much as they made her we are ^o* a long
time together upon her fl^^^ a pe^ce of armor covered with c^oth or ^a^^asse,
that by this mean they might make her hanche return into the proper place
which grew backwards as has ^^^n said, and this they did while s^e dwelled in
the hows of M Maximili^^ (...) ^^quyre, and Burgomaister of the City o^
B^^xell^s: unto which place her parents caused a certain famous surgeon to
come from Hare^tales, who indeuo^red to help her, and by stret^hing out her
body with certain kind of instruments made for that purpose, thought to put
her joints in their right places. But when they saw that this profited her
nothing* they permitted her to go^ for diverse years without any shoe
vnder-layd, or without any other help, h^^ing that in time by forceing herself
to go, and by setting all her whole foot on the ground, her left leg would be
str^tched foo^^h longer, and become equa^l to the other. But this did no more
he^p her then the former remedies, for this ^a^^ari^ remained lame, and in
the same case as she was before* Having afterward a desire to employ her self
in the service of God in some order of Religion, and being for this end
presented by her parents to certain Religious women of the whyt ladies, in the
town of H^y in the cuntrie of ^^ege, they refused to admit her, for that they
saw her so lame, which also happened unto her at the Cloister of Cortenberge as
the Lady Magdalen de Ni^elle Abbess of the same place confessed, when she
afterward hard talk of the said Mistress Catharin. Notwithstanding all this,
some years afterward she perseuering in this her good purpose became
religious in the foresaid convent of the white Ladies in L^^^in on the xv. of
October in the year 1585, where she first lived whilst she was but a little
one as before has been said. Having now been in this Cloister for the space of
xvij. years, and still so l^me that she could not go one foot, no^ stad
upright, no^ yet so much as step out of her bed without her shoe that was
vnderlayd, (which she was constrained to use again a good while before) and
this her accident was very paineful unto her, especially when she was to stand
for any ^o^g space in the quier, and she could never kneel but only on her
right knee, as all the Religious there did auouche: and that ordinarily they
were forced to put a step or p^ece of wood under her left knee to make it
aequal with the other. But having hard talk of the great miracles which our
Lord wrought by the invocation of his holy Mother at Montaigu, unto which place
all the world went in pilgrimage, and many received help and aid in their
infirmities and necessities, she also began to have a desire to go thither, and
to prove if peradventure it pleased God to heal and cure her: but she could
not obtain leave of her superior, who thought it no way exped ent for her.
Notwithstanding she continued in her former devotion, hoping (that if she
should not be cured of her halting) she should at leastwyse obtain some
spiritual profit for the salvation of her soul: and hereupon she ceased not
now and then to renew her suit, and to request her leave that she might make
the said voyage, and namely she entreated the Reverend Father in God M. James
Iansoni^s Doctor of divinity and Superior or Superintendent of that Cloister,
who ^iking not the s^^d Re^ig^ous woman's request, ende^oured to persuade her to
ho^d her self content, and to bear patiently for the love of God this her
infirmity, and that this would be a cause of her greater humility and more
merit. Upon which reason she remained quiet and contented. But whereas the
Prince Marquis of Hauregh was come to Louain upon the xxvijth. of September in
the year 1603. and intended to go to salute our Lady at Mo^taigu this maid
Mistress Catharin ^ser^a^rtes labored so much by the intercession of some of
her friends that the said Lord Marquis obtained her license of the said
Iansonius, that she might go and perform her desired devotion in the
aforesaid Mountain, and hereupon Mistress Anne de wamel procuratrix of the said
Convent was appointed to accompany her, with whom and with some other
Pilgrims she departed from Louain by wagon toward our Ladies, and they
arrived there upon the xxviijth. of the said month of September, and upon the
xxixth in the morning she did her devotions in the chapel, whether also the
said Lord Marquis came from Die, where he had lodged that night, and he
entreated the said two Religious women to go unto Die with him, which they
did, and there were lodged in the Cloister called Mariendale and two days
after (to wit upon the tuisday and weddensday) they returned again in
company of the said Lord Marquis to do their devotions at Montaigu, the said
Lord being in coache, by reason of his indisposition, and the Religious with
him in regard also of her accident, but all the rest of his household and
company went on foot, with their prayers and spiritual songs, and other such
like devises inciting to devotion. Some of this company and amongst others the
said Religious put themselves in the state of grace, and received the holy
Communion in our Ladies chapel, and did other their particular devotions. Upon
weddensday in the morning whylst the holy service of the mass was saying in
Montaigu, the said Mistress Catharin began to feel a certain pain near unto
her left ear, the which began to pass through all her body even from her
head down to her lame leg, but she knowing not what this should mean, nor yet
much regarding it, she made her prayers to our Lord, more for the good of the
Cuntrie, and the weal of her soul, then for the healing of her leg, except it
pleased God to increase his glory thereby. And on the same weddensday (being
the first of October in the foresaid year 1603) she returned to Louain in the
company o^ thesayd Lord M^rquis and being entered the Convent (for it was now
late) having given the goodnight to her superior she retired herself to her
chamber there to repose her: but as she went up the stayres, she felt that her
shoe which was vnderlayd did so hinder her that she could not well go
therewith* in such sort that being in her chamber, she put it of her foot,
and withal she perceived that without any help of her shoe she was able to
stand vp^ight upon her legs, and to walk along her chamber, feeling a marckable
stretching and plucking within her hip, and throughout all her left leg:
whereat she being much amazed, and praising God for this his favor and the
Glorious Virgin who had prayed for her health (as she now felt by her own
experience) she settled her self to her prayers, intending to persevere therein
all that night: but being somewhat weary, both through her journey as also for
that sleep came upon her, after she had said some devotions she betook her self
to her rest. Upon the next morning rising out of her bed, she found her self so
well, and in such sort altered, that she needed no longer her shoe that was
vnderlayd, but walked vp-right in the Convent only with a pair of pantofles,
fynding no more difficulty in setting both her feet on the ground, the
aforesaid stretching from her hip unto her leg still continuing not-withstanding
that at that time the bunche of the said hip (which was behynd her and out of
the right place) was very much lower and lessened.

The Lord Marquis being advertised of this miracle, sent some of his howshold
and diverse others who had gone with her on this voyage to visit her, who al
found this admirable change in her person, seeing her now upon the second of
Octo^er to walk with much ease, without any high shoe or other supporte.
Whereupon the said Lord Marquis (being meruelousely glad of the grace which our
lord had wrought in this Religious) obtained leave to car^ie her with him to
Bruxelles, there to show her to the most gracious Infant of Spai^ne D^ches of
Bra^ant our Princess: which soon after he performed; having moreover caused

the mir^cles it vvo^k^^h of ^^hich miracle a Ch^n^ of that Church* ha^h latel^

a solemn Mass to be sung before the holy Sacrament of miracle in the said
City of Br^xeles, in way of thanksgiving for this so notable a benefit. At
which time her leg much n^e^ded, waxed greater, and increaced in strength:
insomuch as the bunch before me^tio^ed became a^together eue^ and equal, her
leg turned right, and her heel stretched to the due proportion, in such sort
that she could walk without any le^t, or stand vpr^ght, or separate her legs as
she thought good, and set her self down equally upon both her knees, the which
she was never able to do in two and forty years that is, in all her life
before: as the said Religious woman (who was ever reported to have bee^ a
v^rtuous ma^d, and o^e that ^^a^ed God) declared all these particularities to
diverse persons, as well gentlew^omen ^^ others, which had bee^ with her at this
voyage, and there kept her company, who hard it from her own mouth. And
whereas the Lord Mat^ias Hou^^s Archbishop of M^^^i^ was at that time in
Bruxelles, and had known the said religious from her youth, and had often seen
her lame, h^ caused her to come before him upon the fourth of October, that he
might understand the manner of this alteration even from her own mouth: and
then in his presence and upon her profession she declared in substance all that
which we have already said: and at that very time that she was before the said
Lord Archbishop, she felt her leg to stretch and pull with a forcible interior
working: walking in a chamber in his presence with out any shoe that was
vnderlayd, and setting both her heels equally upon the ground, as appears by
her deposition, written by the hand of the said Lord Archbishop, and subscribed
by her self. And for more assurance of all this, the aforesaid Doctor Ia^s^^^us
caused all the religious women of the Con^ent of the white Dames in Lo^^ine to
be assembled together upon the ^Vth of October, in the foresaid year 1603 and
examined pu^ctually the said mistri^ Cathar^^ (...)ts in their presence,
touching the (...)ing of her leg, unto whom she answered the very self same
that we have here set down: all the said religious women a^ouching that they
had seen her ^^me as we have said, all the time that ^he had dwelled in their
Convent, and she now walked without any vnderlayd shoe, and that far better
then ever she did, as she the^ showed very effectually, walking in their
presence along the chamber, upon shoes of aequal height, and not ^nderlayd, so
that none can see that she any ways bends her body by halting ^owards the
left leg (as before she was ^oun^ to do) although as she her self declared,
she feels so^tymes the aforesaid operation and inward moving, and that very
lively, as appears by the attestation of the said Ia^so^i^s, bearing date as
above.

How a maid was cured of an incurable accident.
MAgdal^^ ^^^ Horen a maid of one and fifty years old, dwelling at Br^xelles;
in the year 1600. upon a certain day by stretching her body so over strained
her self, that she was inwardly hurt very grievously, and there hanged out of
her body a piece of flesh as big (so far as she could judge it) as ones fist,
in such sort that she was constrained to we are a trusse or band made
purposely to ho^d i^ in. Together with this she had a vehement continual
pain, which sometimes so afflicted her, that she could scarce go, or so much
as sit. Physicians call this kind of evil Prociden^ia vt^r^ and they esteem it
incu^able, or at least-wyse yery hard to be cu^ed. Thy she endured about some
three years, until the month of October in the year 1603. But as people
spoke much of the miracles which were wrought at Montaigu by the intercession
of the glorious Virgin Marie, she was moved thereby to go thither, in hope and
confidence that the blessed Mother of God would pray for her: and so she went
by wagon to Montaigu in the foresaid month of October, in the company of
Mistress Agatha Reygers with whom she sometimes dwelled with Mistress Margares
de Morade Mistress Ioane Iacops and some others* and being come to the said
mountain not without great pain, that night they did in the same place their
devotions, and having lodged afterward in Sichen, the next morning they went
on foot to the Chapel of out Lady, where again they prayed, hard mass, and
comunicated, at which very time the said Magdalen received so great ease and
amendment, that she found her self delivered of her old pains and griefs, and
altogether altered, in so much as being returned to Bruxelles she could go and
walk whether soever she pleased without any impediment or grief, and without
any band or trusse, feeling the said piece of flesh to be wholly retired within
her body. Upon the xviijth^ of Noue^ber in the same year 1603 she went again
unto Montaigu, with an other company, there to render thancks to God and his
holy mother, and offered up there one of her bands which she was accustomed to
wear, and although in this last journey she had gone five duitche miles on
foot, yet for all that she felt no pain or appearance of her former grief,
being whole and sound as she is at this present. All the aforesaid things
this Magdalen declared and avouched sole^nly under her oath, before the
Magistrates of Bruxelles upon the nine and twentieth of March in the year 1604.
Upon which day the foresaid Mistress Agatha Reygers and Mistress Margarit de
Merode making also their appearance before the said Magistrates, declared and
affirmed that they knew very well that this Magdalen had endured this accide^t
for three years space, or there about, and how that after she had made the
first voyage to Montaigu she remained perfectly whole, and in good disposition
of her body, which well they might perceive and know, for so much as the said
Magdalen came often to their howses, because she had been servant unto Mistress
Agatha, as has been said. And upon the seventh of April following, Anne va^
Suick Beghine dwelling in Bruxelles, and there for xxv. years practicing the
art of surgerie appeared before thesayd magistrates, who under the like oath,
declared and assured that she had in cure this Magdalen, but she could not help
her: showing moreover how at the same time (through the assistance of God) she
had healed many wounderful diseases and accidents, but she held that (which
this Magdalen had) hardly ever to be cured by any natural means or work of
man. And all this that has been said, is to be seen by an instrument and Act
which passed before the Magistrates of Bruxelles as well upon the foresaid nine
and twe^tith of March, as upon the seventh of April 1604, subscribed P. Numan
Secretary, and signed with the seal of the said City.

How a certain man was cured of the falling evil.
HEnry de Keersmakers a baker and citizen In the end of Iulie, ^t begin ning of
August 1603
of Louain was attainted with the falling sickness, which he had endured about 4
years. It took him both in his hows, as also in the Churches and streets to
his great confusion and callamitie. But understanding of the miracles which
were done at Mo^taigu by the intercession of our Lady, he resolved about the
feast of S. John in the year 1603. to go thither in Pilgrimage, with
confidence that the Mother of God would assist him, and that she would obtain
that his disease might be helped. About which time setting forwards barefoot on
his way he did his devotions at the Chapel of our Lady, and the next day
returning toward Louain he feit himself somewhat eased, and to have reco^ered
more strength then before, as he told them that were in his co^pagnie, with
this amendment he continued for eight days without feeling his accustomed
disease, but only some signs thereof, and a little stretching of his limbs.
Eight days after he went thither again barefoot, and having made his prayers
to our Lady as before, and being come home he found himself very free from
his former passion. Whereupon eight days after he returned thither again the
third time also barefoot, in company of some four or five others, amongst
whom were two Religious men, Cordeliers of the said City of Louain, but
being come within two miles of thesayd Mon^a^g^ he was taken again with a fit
of his old disease, and that for the space of half an hour, but returning to
him self, and being helped by the said Religious men, he was for some part of
the way led to the Chapel of our Lady, where that evening he did his
devotions, and remained for that night in the Mountayn. The next day he
returned again to his prayers in the Chapel, whether the foresaid Religious
men (who had lodged in a Cloister of Cord^li^rs in* Die) also came, and one
of them said mass, beseeching our Lady for the health of this poor patient:
and after the office was ended, he returned with some others toward Louain
very merry and pleasant, without any wearines in his travail, to the great
wounderment of all those that were in his company. And after this third
visitation which was now more then a year since, he was never taken or
troubled with his malady, but he is become more healthy and in better
disposition of his body, the never he was before, acknowledging that herein he
has received a singular benefit and favor of the Mother of God. And since his
c^re he has been four other times barefoot at M^^^aigu, there to render
thancks to our Lord and to the blessed Virgin.

And ^l^ this that has here been said this Henry de Ke^r s^aker has deposed
and af^^med under his solemn oath, before the Magistrates of the City of
Louain upon the xxlijth. of October 1604. Upon which day appeared also M Laures
Bo^s^m procurator, and Lewis vanden Vyuere grocer, both Burgeses and
inhabitants of the same City, who under the like oath affirmed and testified,
that they had often frequented and kept company with theforesayd Henry, (and
especially this Lewis who had dwelled some four or five years in a hows just
over against his) and thereby they knew very well that some years since this
Henry was much troubled with the falling sickness, which took him sometimes
sitting at table with the^, sometimes in the Cloister of the Iacobius, yea and
sometimes in the very street as he went with them to gather alms for the said
Religious Iacobius, in so much that to avoid peril and confusion, this office
was taken from him. And how that after he had made the Pilgrimages to Mantaigu
as has been said, they neither saw or hard that for the space of a whole year
he was ever taken with the said disease: whereat they themselves much merueiled,
seeing him so well and in so good health, as he was at that present. All which
is manifest by the attestation of the said Magistrates, made thereof and dated
as above, and sealed with the seal of Louain signed R. le Prince Secretary.

A miraculous cure of a certain grief and languishing disease.
SIster Anne Laureys being threescore years old or there about, born in
Bruxelles, and professed in the Convent of the Religious women called of the
Annunciatae in Louain. In the year 1584. why lest she sung in the quier with
some other of her religious sisters who had very strong voices, and sung very
high, forcing her voice to follow them in singing, felt that she had hurt and
indamaged her head, having a pain therein so vehement and strong, that it
seemed unto her as if her head had been cleft in twayn: which pain daily
increaced: and besides she felt in her head a noise and continual sounding
like a clock, which she endured for a long space, until the xxvjth of October
in anno 1603. and so for the space of xviij. years: so that no day passed
without great grief and pain, and for the most part she was constr^^n^d to
absent her self from the divine service and office with the other Religious,
because she could not endure to hear them sing, no nor so much as any words
that might be spoken alowd, and when those of the Convent had their recreation,
she was forced to get her self out of the company, because she might not be
troubled with their voices, and ordinarily every night it was very long ere she
could sett^^ her self to sleep. To cure this grief the had used the counsels
of many persons, and many remedies, without any profit at all. Finally having
understood of the miracles that were wrought at Montaigu by inuocar^ng upon our
Lady, she turned her self with all her heart unto her, hoping that by her
intercession she might obtain help. And for so much as the Religious women of
that Convent (acording to their rule) never go out of their Monastery, they
reedified an old Chapel which was in their garden, and they placed therein an
Image printed acording to that of Montaigu, to the end in that place they might
exercise their devotions, and do honor to the Mother of God because it was not
lawful for them to go unto Montaigu. Unto this Chapel the said ^^ster Anne
went upon three sundry days, instantly beseeching the Virgin Mart to procure
her her health, with intention that she her self would have gone to the
miraculous place, if it had been lawful. And upon the third day (being the
xxvith of October 1603.) betwixt five and six of the clock at night, having
ended her third Visitation, she felt her self much eased, and withal to be
much in wardly comforted: and after compline having retired herself into her
chamber, she rested that night very well, not hearing any noise or sounding in
her head, and waking about eleven of the clock the same night, she found
herself so well and healthie, and so free from her malady, that she went with
the rest of the Religious to matines: and so continuing better and better, she
never after felt any pain or trouble in her head, but inioyed her perfet and
intier health. All which here is said may be seen by the attestation of sister
Clare Leyen her Superior, Sister Anne S^^its the vicaresse of the said
Convent, and by the oath of the said Sister Anne Laureys, made in the hands of
the Reverend Father Anthony de Berga^g^^ Confessor of the said Convent, upon
the xxth. of January 1604. and after that again upon the xvith of March in the
same year, in the presence of the Magistrate^ of the said city of Louaine,
before whom also her Superior appeared, who in like manner declared and
avouched that she knew right well how that the said Religious had the a foresaid
passion and grief so long as has been said, which partly she had seen and
partly had hard of her self. And all this is conformable to the attestation of
the said Magistrates, bearing date as above, and signed R. le Prince
Secretary, and sealed with the seal of the same City.

How a Religious woman of the order of S. Clare was suddenly healed of the
palsy.
SIster Anne de Br^y^ daughter of John de Br^y^ ^^^ Aelst, merchant and
inhabita^t In Oct. 1601.
of the city of Antwerp werp, in the street called Ki^^orp, was professed
amongst religious ^ome^ in the Cloister of S. Clare in Antwerp commonly called
of the poor Clarisses, in the year 1593. she being xxii. years of age,
healthie and sound of al her limbs, going, serving, and laboring as the rest
of the same Convent: but in the month of October in the year 1597. she was
taken with a great disease, in such sort that twyce they gave her the extreme
vnctio^ and they did the recomme^dations of her soul in the quier, as is the
custom to do unto Religious persons that are in dying. But having been
somewhat recovered of this disease, she regained so much strength that she could
walk with the aid of a staf and by holding up her self against the wall, which
continued for some six weeks or there about: but a little after this she was
so taken with the palsy, and became so impotent, that she could neither go,
kneel, or stand, and so remained for the space of six years, in the infirmarie
of the said Convent, having so lost the use of her limbs, that when any would
remove her, they were constrained either to carry her, or to draw her,
sometimes by one of the strongest of the Religious and sometimes by two of
the^, although she did also help her self with her staff. And it hapened
sometimes that her hands became so impotent, that they were constrained to feed
her like a child and to put her meat into her mouth. In this six years space
the poor patient used diverse sorts of medicines, drincks, chafings, bathes,
and other devises that were thought good against the palsy and impotencie, and
this, first by the assistance of M. William Peter's Doctor of Physic, etc
after his death, of M. God^rey V^^^^yk ^ Physician of the City of A^^werp, as
also of M. Cornelius van Velsen Sutgeon dwelling in the same place, yet never
felt she any ^ase remedy or diminution of her evil. In so much as the said
Physician and surgeon judged her disease to be an ouergrowen and incurable
impotencie, so surceasing to apply any other thing unto her, as the said Doctor
and Surgeon a^o^ched solemnly under their oaths in the hande^ of the Reverend
the Vicar and Official of the dioces of Ant^erp, upon the fifth of Nouem^er in
the year 1603. and under the like o^he before the magistrates of the same City
upon the fourth of December in the same year. This Religious woman therefore
being destitute of all humain aid and remedy, settled all her con^^dence in
God: and having hard of the great miracles which our Lord daily wrought by the
invocation of his holy Mother at Montaigu, she began to have a desire to send
some thither to visit our Lady for her, and to pray for her heal^h if it were
expedient for her soul.

Whereupon she entreated her Superior Sister Co^nelia Gyll^s that she would
^end to Montaigu on^ or two lay sisters to present her prayers and devotions to
ou^ Lady for her, the which thing was granted her, and so Sister Anne
Groel^ns and Sister Elizabeth van I^me^zele were sent th^ther, and to them was
delivered the staff wherewith the impotent pati^nt was wount ^o assist her
self, and withal a piece of money to offer there in sign of her desvre and
intention to implore the aid of the Mother of God: and thus departing from
Antwerp together with the Mother of Sister Anne Gro^^en^, vp^n a thursday
being the 23th of October in the said year 1603. and passing by Bruxe^les and
L^^^^n, they arrived at Montaigu upon Saturday, being the xxvth of the same ^^
^^^^^: where they, perform^d their ^^uotions and prayers for her health, as
(...) the said Sister An^e de Br^y^ they were willed: which also they continued
upon the Sunday and Moonday following. A^ which time also the Religious of he^
Convent at A^^werp say some prayers to that end. And upon the xxvii^th. of
the* same month (being SS. Simon and ^^^^^ day) the said Sister A^ne awaking
so^^ after four of the clock in the morning and fynding her self in her
accustomed impotencie much sorrowed thereat, notwithstanding she resigned
herself to the mercy of God, neither was she yet out of hope of the recovery
of her health. ^eeing in these conceits suddenly she had a desy^e to rise out
of her bed, and to go^ to the quier to give thancks unto God; and although she
felt no strength ^o her body yet notwithstanding she ^ook a staff which stood
hard by her bed indeuou^ing therewith to raise her self, and being fair and
softly come out of her bed, and standing on her feet, she began to feel some
strength in her legs: whereupon leaving her staff, and signing ^erself with the
sign of the cross, wi^^ ^ great confi^^^^^ which ^he had in the ^orious
Virgin Marie she began to walk alone, and being come into the midde^^ o^ her
chamber which ^t that time was in the ^nf^^marie, she felt a certain ^^^ning ^n
her head, in such sort that she thought she should have fallen to the ground*
but calling upon the name of God to grant her fo^ce and strength, she went
forward til she came to an other chamber hard by, where upon the great comfort
and joy w^^ch then she conceived, s^e cast her self thryce upon her knees, to
yield thancks unto God, and by little and little being come into the quier,
she kneeled down before the Blessed Sacram^nt, where she prayed and said T^
Deum. From thence she went into the dormitorie, and awaking the Mother Abbess
or Superior, she told her that she was cured, whereat the Superior much
me^^ailing commanded her to go forthwith to the quier, whether af^erwards she
came with all her other Relig^ou^ and there veelded thancks to (...) (...) and
his holy Mother, beginning (...) the a foresaid song Te Deum, at (...) ^yme the
said ^ister Anne de B^uy^ (...) and vpryght in her seat as well as the rest,
having also bin but a little before for a long time on her knees before the
Blessed Sacrament, and the altar of our Lady: which she was never able to have
done for six years before. After this the said sister Anne walked alone
freely, without staff or other stay throughout all the Monastery. Upon the
very self same day came to these Clarisses Father John Pell^^s Cordelier, their
Confessor, who found thi^ sister Anne in good health, and walking without any
thing to help or support her, where at he was much amazed, and tha^cked the
Almighty for this his mercy: saying some prayers to the same purpose, and
incontinently the same sister Anne came down without any help to the confession
seat, to which place she could not go for seven years before: but either her
confessor was forced to go unto the infirmarie (where she remained
continually) to hear her confessions, or otherwise they must carry or draw
her to the grate or confession seat. After she had confessed, the said Father
John Pelle^s after mass administered unto her the blessed Sacrament of the
altar, in way of thanks giving: for the receiving whereof she put her self on
her knees without any difficulty, arose, did reverence, and departed thence,
without any to help her: and that so reddely as if she had never been sick.
Upon the XXXth of the same month of October the two Religious that were sent
to Montaigu returned again to Antwerp, where they found the said sister Anne
whole and in good health, as she is even unto this day, to the great admiration
of all those which before had seen her, and especially of the Citizens and
inhabitants of Antwerp, who in great number came to the Monastery to see and
understand the mercy which it pleased our Lord to show to this Religious
woman, by the invocation of his holy Mother, tha^king and praising him for the
same. And all this which we have here set down was solemnly examined, avouched,
and wittnessed under their oaths, first before M. John del Rio priest,
Archdeacon and Chanon of the Collegial Church of our Lady in Antwerp, being
the Vicar general and Official of the Dioces there, and afterward again before
M. John vander E^^t Escheuin, and M. Dionis vander Neese^ Secretary of the
said City, appointed i^ commission for this purpose by the Magistrates,
according to a resolution and decree of the second of December in the said
year 1603. subsigned I. vanden Kieb^o^, where all was verified under the oaths
of every one, so far as might touch them, and according to their knowledge: to
wit, by the foresaid sister Cornil a Gy^^ Mother Abbess of the Co^uent,
Brother John Pelle^s the Confessor, Brother Anthony de Paut^ghen his assistent,
sister Agnes Rey^s keeper of the infirmatie, who had the care of the said sick
person for a long time: the said sister Anne de Bruyn, sister Anne Gro^l^^^,
sister Elizabeth van Immerzele, who went in pilgrimage for her: and M. Godfrey
Verreykr^ physician of the same City, M. Cor^^l^^s van Velsen, and John
Watri^x Surgeons, who had assisted this impotent Religion* woman during her
malady, and for many years had labored to help and cu^e her. In like manner
John de Bruyn van Ael^^, Father of the said sister Anne, and Mistress Sa^a
vander Weelde her Mother in law, who had diverse times visited and frequented
the said Religious woman, in the time of her infirmity and palsy, who on the
next day after the feast of SS. Sy^^^^ and I^d, found her whole and cured,
against all man's hope: as is manifest by their oaths as before has been
specified.

How a Religious woman was cured of the Cancker.
SIster Margarit va^den Perre born in Antwerp In Oct. 1601.
and there professed a lay sister in the Cloister of the third order of S.
Francis, being thirty years old, had the cancker in her breasts, for the
space of four months, as diverse Physicians and Surgeons judged, who had her
in cure: to wit, two men, and two women, and yet she could not find any help
for all their labor: yea on the contrary her evil waxed daily greater and
wors: in such sort that all those that visited her said plainly that it was
incurable, for that the patient had her breasts as hard as a stone, reddish,
bluish, and so ugly that it was a grievous thing to behold them. Her right pap
was swollen even unto her arme-pit and from thence her grief passed unto her
back, where it seemed that it would have burst out. Under the other pap was a
great swel ling, and out of her nip^^es issued somtymes a certain kind of
matter, somtymes very blood, and so it did somtymes also out of her ears.
Thus the poor Religious woman was so full of pain, and in so miserable an
estate, that for a whole years space before her cure she was not able to do
any manner of woork, neither could she ly, but was constrained to sleep
sitting, and that with very great pain: and sometimes one of her arms became
so stiff that she could not lift it to her head. And to be healed of this
accide^t she repaired to a skilful woman called Magdalen, dwelling in the
Brestraet in the said City of Antwerp: who for the space of some six months
took in hand to cure her, applying certain plasters of herbs unto her: but
when in steed of helping her she became wors, she left that cunning woman, and
used a certain plaster which a famous Surgeon dwelling the town of Harentals
called M. Peter, had prescribed her, who also helping her nothing thereby, and
perceiving her self to be past all hope to be cured, she left him also.
Afterward an old Portuguez Surgeo^, called Vento Rodriguez counseled her to
make an issue in her arm, to draw out thereby the humor of the canker: but all
was in vain, and to no profit at all. After that again she applied diverse
remedies which some of her neighbors and friends taught her, but without any
further success. After a certain time she permitted that her breasts might be
visited by an elderlie maid, who exercised her self in surgerie called Anne
Cammarts, alias A^^c^^^x: who having visited her twice or thryce, and
perceiving that her disease was incurable: she gave her no other cou^ sell, but
that she should take a purgation twice or thryce every year: which she tried
for once or twice, but durst not proceed therein, in regard of an other
accident which she had, to wit, a rupture, which also she had sustained for
the space of viij years. At the last she showed her impediment again to an
other cunning woman called Gertrude Munters, who found that the canker was not
only in both her breasts, but that it had passed even unto her back, where
also she felt a great hardness: and this woman did nothing else to her but rub
her back with a certain kind of ointme^t, which she could hardly endure,
causing her to apply unto her breasts certain places of lead, and fair
lin^en, counseling her furthermore to tamper with no more physic, but to
commend all unto God, for so much as there was no other way to help her. And in
this manner this Religious woman was abandoned and forsaken of all human
help, every one foretelling her that visited her that e^e long she should come
to that misery that would be most lamentable for any to b^hold. In this time
so vehement and excessive great were the pains which this Religious woman and
^red, that often times she consumed whole nights in tears and lamenting.

But some three months after having understood that Sister Ann^d B^urn, the
Cla^^sse was miraculousely cured by the invocation of our Lady of Montaigu, she
turned her self with all her ha^t toward our lady, beseeching the mother or
superior of the Conue^t that she might make a voyage to Montaigu, to recommend
there her health unto the Mother of God.

Which was granted her, upon the fourth day of November in the year 1603: and
from the very time that she had obtained her said leave, she began to feel some
ease in her self. And upon the next day she departed from An^werp, together
with Sister Marie Clements, guardian of the sick, who had assisted her during
the time of her malady. They having past by Bruxelles and arrived at Lo^ain
the patient being not able to endure the shoggig of the waggo^, went from
Louain unto Montaigu on ^oot. Whether when they were come, they did their
devotions that very day in the Chapel of our Lady. The next day (being the
nynth of the aforesaid month) they hard three masse^, at the first mass the
said patient was very weak and sick, but having received the blessed Sacrament
of the altar she began to feel in herself a notable ease, as well in regard of
her disease of the cancker as of her rupture, and at the third mass she found
herself perfectly whole: for it s^emed unto her that she felt a hand stroki^g
over her and therewith to wype away all her pain. And from that time feeling
herself perfectly whole, she gave thancks to God, and to his most holy Mother,
leaving in the Chapel the lead and clothes which she used before. And thus
returned with her company to Antwerp whole and sound. And being come home,
the said sister Marie (...) visited her breasts, and fosid them perfectly cured
and in good order: where as before they were so miserable and deformed, that
none could behold them without horror: fynding also that the end of her teat
was closed up, and that there was no hardness in all her bosom but a very
little in her left pap, which within three or four days after was gone and
ceased.

So that since, the time of this visitation she remained q^yre delivered and
free of the c^cker, as also of her rupture, which she had endured for eight
years space, as has been said: and so she settled herself to labor and
travail ^gaine with the other Religious in the said Cloister, as before she
was accustomed. Some days after her return she was visited again as well by the
aforesaid An^e Cammarts, as also by Gertrude Man^ers, both expert in forgerie
as we have said, who to their great admiration found the said Religious
intyrely and perfectly cured, as well in her breasts, as in her arme-pitts and
back, without any appearance or sign of any hardness, or of any other disease,
but that she was whole, and very well in all her body. All this here set down
was affirmed and verified by their solemn oaths, made in the hands of the
aforesaid Vicare of Antwerp, upon the xxj. of November 1603, and upon the iiij.
of December in the same year. The like solemn attestation was made thereof
before these commissaries: M. John vander Noot Escheuin, and M. Denis va^der
N^esen secretary of the said City, by these persons here named: to wit, by
Sister Ioane de Herd Mother ^r Superior of thesavd Convent, by the fore*
named Sister Marga^^t vander Perre, Sister Marie Clemens, mistress or guardian of
the infirmarie, Sister Hester de Mompere, and Sister Marie Perez, all Religious
women of the same Convent: who at sundry times had assisted this Sister
Marga^^t, and had seen her diseases, who also knew her repture, whereof
together with her cancker she was healed, as has binsayd. Also the aforesaid
An^e Camm^erts alias Abacucx and Ge^^^le Man^ers affirmed the same under their
oaths: who in times past had care of the said Religious woman, and had visited
her breasts, both before and after her said cure, as is manifest by an
instrument framed thereof, and dated as above.

The curing of a sore which was sisteen years old.
IOane Rut^ the widow of Io^n St^obant, in Nou. 1603.
of about fifty years of age, dwelli^g in the lordship of Campenhout in the
Maierdome of the City of B^^xell^s. In the year 1589. got an accident in her
left leg, upon the ankle of her soot, whereupon grew a sore or issue as great
in compass as ones h^nd, and a finger or more in length: wherein she felt such
vehemen^ and continual pain, that she could neither by night or day take any
rest: and she was very often fully minded to have cut of that leg, b^^ing
forced for the most part to keep her bed, or to sit in a chair, being not able
to go in any manner, except it were sometimes with two crutches, or whith a
staff, or else creeping on all four upon the ground. And although she had
applied diverse remedies, yet could she receine no ease, and her cuil was
acounted incurable. But in the year 1603. hauig hard of the miracles which o^r
Lord did woork by the invocation of his ho^y Mother at Montaigu the said Ioane
made a vow to go thither in pilgrimage: and whereas through her great pain,
debilitie, and weakn^ she was not able to go, it happened that a certain person
moved with compassion of her estate, carried her in a wagon unto Montaigu, in
the month of October in the aforesaid year 1603. Where being in the Chapel
of our Lady she did there her devotions, with firm hope and confidence to be
cured: and returuing hom^ carried with her some of the water which is behynd the
chapel in the said Mountain, the which (that it might last the longer) thee
mixed with r^uer water, and she daily washed and made clean her l^g there
with, whereby incontinently she perceived a great alte^ation and e^se in her
sore, and without applying any thing else thereunto it healed up of it self, and
with^n few months was perfectly whole, in ^uch sort that at this present she
goes and walks lustely whethersoeuer she pleases, not feeling any pain or
grief* being now able to go three or four duitche miles at a time, whereas
before (though she might thereby have gained all the world) she was not able to
go one mile. And in thankfulness for this benefit, the said Ioane went an other
time in Pilgrimage to Montaigu, within the Octaues of the Assu^p^ion of our
Lady, in this year 1604. and this she performed on foot, and went thither on
one day, and returned on the next, without any impediment by her former
accident. As the said Ioane declared and avouched all these things under her
oath, solemnly given before the chief Maier and Escheuines of the said Lordship
of Campenh^ut, upon the nynteenth of October in the said year 1604, according
to their attestation given thereof, and sealed with the seal of the said
Lordship, and subsigned R. Hermans Secretary.

How a Child being broken was cured.
FRancis Addiers of four years and an Ir Nou. 1603.
half old, the son of Francis Addiers, and of Annevande^ VVinckele his wife
dwelling in Bruxelles, was broken on the left side of his belly, and this
happened him when he was but six weeks old, so that from that time they made him
wear a trusse, because the said rupture appeared of the bigness of a turkeys
egg, and never kept in, but when they put on his trusse: and often times it
was seen in his secret parts, whereby he endured great pain, especially twice
or thrice every month at the change of the moon. And although his mother had
applied diverse medicines both by the advice of some surgeons as of others, yet
she nothing prevailed.

But having heard the fame of Montaigu, and of the miracles that were there
wrought by the in^ocation of our Lady, she resolved to carry thither her
child, and there to pray unto our Lady for his health, which she performed
about the midst of October, in the year 1603, and remained there for three
days, praying daily in the said Chapel: and after the third day she
perceived that her chylds disease was much amended. Whereupon she left there
his trusse in memory thereof: and being come home she perceived that his
rupture appeared again but after that time her child was perfectly cured, so
that since the said pilgrimage he never needed either tr^sse or any other
remedy, being much altered in his body, so that he became fatter and
stronger, going, running, and playing, as other children of his age are wou^t
to do, not feeling any pain or impediment by the said drupture: which things
his mother sole^nly affirmed under her oath, in the presence of the Magistrates
of Bruxelles, upon the eleventh of December, in the said year 1603. Upon which
day also Arnold Addiers under burgemaister of the said city declared and
affirmed under the like oath before the said M^gistrates, that he had seen the
said child thus broken, when he was but six weeks old, as has been said: and
that he had made inquiry after all sorts of remedies to cure him, if it had
been possible, and yet nothing would help, so that the surgeons were of opinion
that the child was to be cut, whereunto neither he nor any of his kins^olks
and friends would agree, showing more over that he knew right well how that the
said A^^^ vanden Winkele his daughter in law went with the said child to visit
our Lady a^ Montaigu, and how that after her return the said child was found
to be cured, as now he is. And all this is manifest by the attestation of the
Magistrates, subsigned P. Numan, and sealed with the scale of the same City.

A sudden cure of a laguishing disease:
SIster Michielle Blyleuen, daughter of M. In No^. 1603.
Thomas Blyleuen Sergeant Ma^or of the City of Louain, professed Religious of
the Convent of the Annunciata in the said City, in the year 1603 fell into a
great disease, which lasted for the space of six months, together which a
perpetual pensiuenes at her heart, and a shortness of breath; which was so great
that she lost all her strength, being so feeble and faint, that six or seven
times every day the swear issued violently out of every part of her body, and
the tears out of her eyes; and for two whole months she was not able to go in
any sort, but as she was led by some one of the Religious, at which time she
so lost her appetite, that she would receive no meat, but upon force and her
superiors commaundment. In such sort, that she was forced to use the counsel
first of Doctor Vilerius, and afterward continually of Doctor Fienus both
professors of Physic in the University of Louain. But for all that they had
prescribed her receiptes at diverse times, yet she found no profit or ease
thereby. Whereupon having now for two months space left all use of Physic,
she determined to go and pray three times at the Chapel which they had
accomodated in their garden, in the honor of our lady, and in memory of the
miracles which by her intercession were wrought at Montaigu: with a desire to
have done the same in the place it self if it might have been permitted her.
Going therefore to the said Chapel, with great pain and labor, upon a
saturday being the xvth. of November in the said year 1603: and having there
do^ne her devotion, she began to feel a great ease and alteration in her body,
recovering a notable force and ablenes in her self, in so much that on the same
day she did read the mattines of our Lady on her knees, which for five months
before she was not able to do. On the night following she being in the quier
with the rest of the religious, and reading her hours, at the very instant
that mattines was ended by the song of Salve Regina, the said Sister Michielle
felt as it were a hand upon her shoulder which seemed to have pressed her down,
and this was in so evident a manner that she felt and perfectly discerned the
very fingers; whereby she started, and looked back to see the person that
touched her. After Mattines she went to repose her, and rising again in the
morning she found herself meruelously amended, and so strong, that immediately
after, she went to the Church to be present at divine service with the rest of
the Religious, with whom she sung so loud and lively that they were greatly
astonished thereat, not knowing what voice it was that sounded so shrill. And
from that time afterward she has remained healthie, and in good plight,
singing and assisting at the ordinary obseruances as the other Religious: who
a^ouch and testify, that they never saw her so strong and in so good lyking as
she has been since the time above mentioned. And the Superior and Vicaresse
of the said Convent have given attestation and certified under their seals,
that all this is true that has been here related. Likewise the said religious
has also affirmed the same in the hands of the Reverend Father Antonie de
Bergaigne their ghostly father, upon the twentieth of Ianuarte 1604, and after
that again in the presence of the Magistrates of the said City of Louain upon
the xvj. of March in the said year 1604. Upon which day also the said
Superior Sister Clare van Leyden appearing before the same Magistrates,
declared that she knew very well that the said Religious was so long time sick,
and in the aforesaid plight, as having seen it partly with her own eyes, and
partly having understood so much from the said Religious herself, as it is to be
seen by the attestation subsigned R. de Prince Secretary, and sealed with the
seal of the same City.

The cure of a rupture.
FRancis de Alarcon one of the house hold In Nou. 1603.
of the most gracious Archdukes Albert and Isabel Dukes of Brabant our Princes,
happened to be inwardly broken in managing and conducting a froward and
stubborn horse, and the rupture came forth as big as ones fist, who having
endured this evil with much pain for three years and an half, and having used
diverse remedies, by ba^ds, trusses, as other wise, yet without any proffit: at
last he went in pilgrimage to our Ladies at Montaigu, where having prayed a
while in the Chapel, he found himself perfectly freed and healed of his
Rupture: inso much as be left of his band or trusse which he had worn before,
as appears by his attestation given under his own seal.

How a wench that had the palsy, and was deprived of her wits was healed.
ANgela wouters daughter of Elizabeth In No^. 1603.
van Herp the wife of Mathias Le^teens cooper, dwelling in the old Corne-market
in the City of Antwerp, about thirteen years old, was in the month of
September 1603. attained with a certain kind of Apoplexy, especialy in her
arms, and in her right side and leg, with so great a stretching and tremblyng
that she could not go, and at certain times she became dumme, in such sort
that none could understand her when she indcuoured to speak. At last she wholly
lost her speech besides this, she was deprived of her wits, and became so
weak, that she could not apparel herself, no nor so much as put her meat into
her mouth. Her parents caused Master Bennet Rutten sworn Doctor of ^hysick for
the City of Antwerp to be sent for, who visiting the maid, let her blood in
the foot, and afterward gave her a purge, for he was of opinion that her
malladie proceeded of some interior motion, which Physicians call Motus
con^ulsi^^* which take their beginning of some venomous m^^ter gathered in the
brain: but after he had visited her twice or thrice, he let her parents
sufficiently to understand that he had little hope of her recovery, counseling
them to ma(...) some pilgrimage (...) to ^se some other kind of devotion wi^^
their child, and to call upon the help o^ God for her. Which when her parents
had heard they resolved that one of them should go with her to Montaigu, there
to salute the Vi^gin Marie and this was to be performed so soon as the winter
was past. But upon the xxj. of November (being the feast of the Presentation
of our Lady) the said Mathias rising in the morning* advertised his wife of
the feast, and counseled her to go with her daughter to our Ladies Church in
the said City of Ant^erp, to hear mass, and to pray there for her health:
which she did, and after she had heard mass she bought a wax taper,
commanding her daughter to light it, and to set it on the candlestick which
stands before our Ladies altar, which she did with the hand that had the
palsy, assisting and lifting it up with the other hand, her mother beseeching
God to help her, and the blessed Virgin to pray for her health, exhorting her
daughter to call upon the Mother o^ God, that she would vouchsafe to pray for
her: and immediately the said candle (although it was very well lighted) went
out of it self. Beei^g the second time lighted, out it went again, as it
happened also (...) third time, vet she caused it still to b(...) (...)ed again,
and that the maid by her (...) should put it on the foresaid candlestick,
persuading herself that it would be a thing right pleasing to the Virgin Marie
that the child herself should offer up the candle unto her. This done, home
she returns with her daughter, fynding for all this no alteration that day
in the maid: but the wench arising the next day (being the two and twe^tith of
the said month) early in the morning, down she comes all apparailed, whereat
her Mother was much abashed, and enquired of her who had apparailed her: and
when she had heard her answer that she alone had do^ne it, and on the other
part seeing her daughter to go so perfectly well, she began to thanck God and
his holy Mother for it, being singulerly glad to see in her this alteration.
And from that day still afterward the said wench remained whole and sound,
going, speaking, and performing all her bodily functions as well as ever she had
do^ne before: Where as during her foresaid disease she was never able to put on
her clothes, to walk, to speak, or to do any kind of work, but she sat always
trembling, and drawing in her limbs, and sometimes for the space of three
days together a great quantity of froathie spettle ran continually out of
her mouth. And the aforesaid M. Bennet Rutten coming some certain days after
to visit the maid, found her sudda(...) healed as has been said. And all that
(...) bee^ here related is to be seen by them formation taken hereof upon the
fifteenth as also upon the last of December, in the said year 1603. by M. John
vander Noot esquire and Escheuin, and Master Denis vander Neesen Secretary of
the said city of Antwerp, appointed by Magistrates in commission for this
matter. Who upon these things examined under their solemn oaths the said
Mathias Lesteens her Father in law, and Elizabeth van Herp her Mother, the
aforesaid Doctor Master Bennet Rutten, and with these Father Michel van
Ophouen licentiate in Divinity, and Religious in the Cloister of the Iacobins
in the same place, who was kinsman to the child, and had also seen her first
sick, and afterward miraculously cured.

The cure of a Rupture.
Master Balthazar ^an Rossum esquire, ^^ ^ou. 1603.
sometimes coronel of a (...)ent of Allemans in the king or S(...) ^ service,
being of the age of eight ^^^ fifty, in the year 1597. as he was in the
City of Luxemburg he found himself burst on the left side, the which accident
he caused to be visited by diverse surg^ons, both in the said City of
Luxemburg, as also afterward in the City of Do^ay, who judged it to be a very
Hernia or Rupture: and after he had used diverse helps and remedies, at last he
was constrained to wear a trusse fitted for the purpose, not knowing any other
wa^ whereby, to he^p himself. But in the year 1603. ha^ing heard of the
miracles of our la^ie at Mo^taig^ he made a secret promis to go thither in
pilgrimage, and to pray for his health, with good hope to find there some help
and favor. And he accomplished this his devout voyage thryse, about the month
of September in the foresaid year, and after a while one day in Bruxell^s
taking of his trusse which he used to wear, he found himself perfectly healed,
never having any feeling thereof afterward, verily assuring himself that he
had obtained the said cure, only by the favor of God which he had found in
thesayd pilgrimage: for so he declared and avouched the ^ame under his so^^ne
oath upon the xth of Iulie, in the hands of M. John Briex Notarie in the City
of Bruges, and in the presence of Andrew Vermeulen, and George the son of
George Modan witnesses: as appears by a public instrument dispatched
hereof, dated and signed as above, together with the subscript o^ of the said
van R^ssum, with his own hand.

How a Religious woman was suddenly cured of a strange and incurable disease.
SIster Barbara de Berges, the daughter of I^ D^^^ 1^03
M. Gerard de Berges in his lyfe-tyme Physician of Antwerp, being six and
thirty years old, made her profession in Religion in the Cloister called of
the sick lea^ers in the said City, where she was taken with a grievous
malladie, which forced her to keep her bed continually for the space of six
years and three months. Of this her disease no man could give any judgment
what it should be, some saying as mamely D. Ema^^el G^mez Portugues (after that
he had applied unto her many remedies) that it was an inward cancker. Others as
M Bennet Rutten sworn Physician of the said City, that it was Melancholia
hypochondriaca, proceeding from the spleen and left side, accompained with
diverse other accidents and infirmities, as the beating of the heart, and a
certain kind of anguish which took her so often as any person touched her
body, though never so little: and this with such a faynting and feeblenes, that
it seemed that death it self would immediately have ensued thereof. In so-much
that they could not past twyse or thryse in a year take her out of her bed:
and yet every time she would fall into such qualmes and fayntings that they
thought she would have dyed, and at one time amongst others being taken out of
her bed, and laid upon an other on the ground, until such time as her own was
made ready, she became so feeble by this touching and removing her, that they
were forced to let her so ly on the ground for fifteen days continually before
she could return again to her self. Whereof many were witnesses, as hereafter
shallbe set down: and amongst the rest the Reverend. M. Gosu^n Ba^son Chanon of
our Ladies in An^werp, and other Religious women who had assisted in that time
of her sowning. And although she became very cold lying in this manner on the
ground, yet she could not endure that any should apply any hot napkins or
clothes to warm her body, for then would she fall again into her former
sowning and fayntings, that every one looked for nothing else but that she
should die. Yea, which is more, if any did but only touch the bed wherein she
did ly, or so much as the curtains, she took such an apprehension thereof,
that she sowned incontinently, and for this cause, they removed her out of her
bed but twice or thryse in a year, as we have declared.

And the Religious women that attended her were constrained to put good store
of thorns round about the pillars of her bed to the end that none might touch
it whereby the patient might not fall into her strange swownings. And it is to
be noted, that for the space of s^^ month; before she was healed she had never been out of her bed and she could never sit upright therein, either to eat or
drinck, or to do any thing else: moreover the sinews of her left leg were so
shru^ck up that it was shorter by a foot then the other. Again for these six
years this poor religious person had used the counsel and help of many
Physicians, and had tried many medicines, receiptes, and remedies, which rather
made her wors then better: in so much as the Physicians plainly affirmed that
they knew not how to help her. Some sower years before she was cured they made
her an issue, and they thrust a great red whote pack needle through the skin of
her left side, drawing through the same a cord made of silk, the which (for
the space of three months) they drew daily up and down to make a way, through
the which the bad humors might pass: and although hereby she suffered much
pain, yet it profited her nothing at all: yea she rather felt her self woors
then before. Now this Religious seeing there was no hope in man, she armed her
self with patience the best she could, and she had for some years before upon
devotion determined that when she had thus lain seven years, she would either
visit or cause some to visit our Lady of Hanswyck in the city of Maclin, in
hope by way of prayer to obtain her health. But in the mean while having
heard of the great miracles w^^ch were wrought at Montaigu by the invocation of
the glorious Virgin Marie, she had a great desire to visit that place, and she
b^^^eched God to afford her so much strength that she might be carried thither.
In the mean time sister A^^e va^ Calst^r Superior of that Convent having
compassion of the desolate poor creature promised her, that she her self would
go and visit our Lady at Montaigu for her, and that there she would pray for
he^ health: the which thing she fulfilled: and being returned home, she went
to see the said Religious whom she found in the self same state, who told her
Superior that she thought it good to go thither thryce and that she had
beseeched our Lord that she her self might be the third person that should
there visit our Lady. It happened not long after that the above named Chanon
Batson (who diverse times upon charity visited and comforted the patient in her
afflictions) had said mass in the said Convent: at which time he recommended
her to God, and at that very time determined to make a pilgrimage unto Montaigu
in her name, and there to pray for her health. After the mass was said he went
unto the sick person, and declared unto her his intention: the which when she
had heard, she was inwardly altered, and seemed to be exceedingly glad thereof,
as the said M. Batson well perceived: whereby he felt him self the more incited
to accomplish thesayd promise. Upon this resolution he departed from Antwerp
with Sir Vulmar^ Schetz Pastor of the said Convent, passing by bote on the
river of Scaldis unto Willebrook, from thence they went on foot unto Montaigu,
and in like manner returned back again on foot afterward. Being at Montaigu
upon the third of December, in the said year 1603. which was the eve of S.
Barbara, they both calebrated mass in the Chapel of our Lady, and prayed
unto almighty God by the intercession of his holy Mother to vouchsafe to
restore this poor and miserable Religious woman to her health. Upon the self
same day that the holy sacrifice was there offered for her, the said Religious
woman being in Antwerp in her bed felt her self to be much amended, and to
have obtained a new strength, and immediately afterward she felt so great
pain in her body, that she fell into an ague. The next day (being the feast
of S. Barbara) at eleven of the clock about noon she began again to feel her
strength much to increase, and she spoke to the Sister that kept her that she
would reach unto her her hand, which when she had taken, she raised up her
self by her self, upon her feet upon her bed: whereat the sister being much
astonished cried out for fear, and the said Religious fell down heavily again
upon her bed, not sustaining for all this any alteration or faintnes hereby,
whereas before she was wou^t to fall into sowning and that almost to death, when
any did so much as but touch her, yea although it were never so softly, as has
been said. And the said sister Barbara de Berges remained all that day in her
bed, although she thought that after dinner she was strong enough to walk up
and down her chamber. But upon the next day following which was friday and the
fifth of the aforesaid month of December, she craved to have her apparel
delivered unto her, which was given her, and she put it on alone by her self
without any to help her, beginning first with her left arm, on which side all
her disease had been, which arm none might touch before, no more then any
other part of her body without the danger of falling into her accustomed
faintenes: and so having apparailed herself she came cheerfully out of her
bed: and signing her self with the sign of the cross, down she cast herself
upon her knees, and lifting up her eyes to heaven, she gave thancks to our Lord
and said: Praise be to the O Mari^. Which when the other Religious women saw
who were in the chamber with her, they powered out tears of joy: and Sister
Michielle de Bergu^s the natural Sister of the said Barbara fell into a swoune,
upon tender affection and astonishement which she had conceived. After this the
said Sister sat her down in a chair by the fire for an hour or two, where as
before she could not endure any fire, no not so much as that her clothes should
be warmed. Sitting thus before the fy^r she said that she fe^t such a force and
strength in her bones and ma^ow, from her head down to her feet, as if some had
powered somewhat from above upon her, and she began to walk all alone about the
chamber. Whereupon the religious women who were there present sang Te Deum in
way of thancks giving, and after that the Hymn A^^ Mar^s stella, the said
patient inioying the health and good disposition of her body going and walking
up and down whether so ever she pleased recovering also her appetite which so
long time before she had lost, in so much that ^oorthwith she dranck a good
draught of wine, and some other sustena^ce she also received, and that with a
very good stomach, whereas in times past she had no desire to her meat, and
she could not so much as swallow down a little wine although it were drop after
drop without great pain and difficulty. And upon the same friday at night
came home from Mo^taigu the said master Batso^, and the Pastor, and coming
into the said religious woman's chamber, they found her sitting before the fire,
who arose incontinently of her self and gave them the welcome home, showing
unto the^ how that all her accidents and diseases were perfectly cured. And so
became daily more strong, and in better plight: in such sort, that upon the
next day she heard three masses, with the rest of the Conue^t, at the which she
assisted for the most part upon her knees. Some two or three days after the
feast of S. Barbara the a foresaid Doctor M. Benedict Rutten was sent for by
the Convent, to visit the said religious woman, whom he found whole and
strong, going up and down the monastery without any crutch, staff, or any
human help. And all this that has been here said was verified and solemnly
avouched before Master John vander N^^^ Esquire and Escheuin, and master
Denis vander N^^s^n Secretary of the said City of Antwerp appointed in
commission by the Magistrates for this matter as has been said, acording to
the information taken hereof, and put in writing: and this by diverse persons of
good: credit, who at diverse times had visited and assisted the said patient in
her grievous malladie, and afterward found her thus suddenly cured: to wit,
the said Sister Anne van Cal^^^re Superior, the said Master Gosuin Ba^son
Chanon, and Master VV^mare Schetz Pastor, the said Sister Barbara de Bergues
the said Doctor Benedict Rutten, and Sister Michielle de Bergues upon the last
of December, in the said year 1603. And this same religious was afterward in
very good and perfect health of body upon the last of May in the year 1604,
being visited by him that has written these things and in the month of Iulie
she personally went in pilgrimage to our Ladies at Mo^taigu, as she herself had
before prayed our Lord, and verily trusted that she should be the third that
was to go thither in pilgrimage for herself: a thing to all the world very
strange and wounderfull.

A long deafnes cured.
DAme Adrian de Goux de wedergraet In De^. 1603.
Prioresse of the Cloister of Shert^gi^^en dale or valley of the Duchess at
O^^^rgem near to the City of Bruxelles: some thirtie-eight years ago became
deaf or both her ears, in such sort that she could not hear when the
Riligious did sing, yea although they did all sing together in her presence,
hearing nothing but a certain little sound as if it had been a far of, and the
like was of the sound of the belles of the said Convent. Besides this* she had
an exceeding continual pain in the top of her head, with a certain noise in
her ears, as if it had been of a water-mill. And although she had applied
diverse remedies, as well by the advice of Physicians, as of others, yet she
received no benefit by them: but that sometimes after she had used these
medicines, and receiptes, she felt her self a little amended, the which lasted
for some one, two, or three months, but she fell again incontinently in to her
accustomed deafnes^ and thus passing many years therewith, she abandoned all
physic, wholly resigning herself to the will of God. But at last understanding
of the miracles of Mo^taigu she purposed to send some thither to our Lady in
pilgrimage: and about the feast of S. Remigius in the year 1603, she sent
thither M. John wa^lart a religiou^ man, and A^^onet Hazard her maid, with an
alms, and she sent thither afterward the said A^tonet alone. The which
pilgrimages being ended, it happened upon the first Sunday of Adue^t that the
said Dame Adrian having been that night at Mattines with the other religious
women: and returned thence to take her rest, she began to dream, and being
betwixt sleeping and waking it seemed unto her that she saw before her an image
of our Lady, the which opening her eyes she beheld: at which sight at the
beginning she was affraied, but taking courage she beseeched the glorious
Virgin Marie that she would vouchsate to pray for the cure of her deafnes: and
forthwith the said Image stretched forth the hand, and touched her upon the
temples and eyes, saying unto her certain words: whereof she has as yet
perfect memory. And so vanishing away, upon the next day, thesayd Prioresse
perceived that she began to hear better then before, and afterward by little
and little within the space of seven or eight days s^e perfectly recovered her
hearing: in so much as at this present she not only hears the sound of the
belles, or the song of the religious, but she can perfectly and distinctly
hear what any speaks, as well as any other, not having the former pains or
noise in her head. As the said dame Prioresse has testified and avouched all
this that here has been said under her own seal, and the seal of her
Co^ue^t, as also under their seals the like has been donn by Father John
M^lemans Confessor, Sister Marie vander Linde^ Subprioresse, Sister Elizabeth
Houture, Sister Marie Beck, Sister Elizabeth du Terne, and Sister Anneva^ Di^ue
all religious women of this Convent: who have seen and noted the said dame
Prioresse, to have had the aforesaid deafenes, and now to enjoy her perfect
hearing, according to an instrument framed thereof, subsigned and sealed as
above, upon the xxvj of May 1604.

How a lamce wench was cured.
John Nyemegens Apoticarie dwelling in In D^^^ 1603.
the Keestrate in the City of Ant^werp, had a daughter called Margarit about
thirtee^ years of age, who from the time that she was six woneths old had a
lame foot, in such sort that her right leg was shorter then the other by a
good hand breadth; whereupon they were constrained to underlay her shoe, and
make it higher, and for all this she went with great pain upon her toes, for
that her heel could not rest upon her shoe, as appeared to the commissaries
according to the information which they received thereof. This wench having
heard what was reported of the miracles which by the intercession of the
glorious Virgin Mother of God were wrought at Montaigu, she never ceased to
entreat her Father to permit her to go thither upon devotion: but her Father
telling her if she desired to be cured, that thereby she might be more pleasing
and acceptable to the world, that then infallibly her prayers would never be
granted. She answered him that she intended no such thing, but rather that her
intention was good and holy: and thereupon he yielded unto her that she might
go that voyage, sending with her an ancient maid servant, called Anne van
Poyer: and they both departed together from Ant(...)erp upon the xxv^th. of
November 1603. and arrived at Die upon the xxviijth. and then upon the next
day being the xxixth. they went to Montaigu, where they remained two days: to
win the xxxth of the said month of November, and the first of December: lying
one night at Montaigu and the other night at Sic^^^: daily performing their
devotions at the Chapel of our Lady: and upon the third day at the end of the
second mass which they hard, the said Margari^ perceived that her foot was
amended, telling the foresaid servant, that she thought she could go well enough
without her high shoe, and thereupon she began to stand upon her feet, and to
walk upright. And being returned from thence to Die they bought her an other
pair of shoes of aequal higth, which she put on, and she perceived that her
legs were now become aequal, and the one as long as the other. And thus upon
the fifth of the said month of December they returned to Antwerp, the said
Margarit being delivered from her accustomed halting, now, walking on both her
feet with shoes of equal higth, because her legs were be come of aequall
length. All which was verified and avouched under their solemn o^hes, both by
the aforesaid John Nyemegens, and by Marie Vermeulen his wife, as also by the
said Anne van Poyer, Philippes vanden Brook and John de Ram Almoner of the said
City and neighbor unto thesayd John Nyemegens, before the aforesaid M. John
vander Noo^ Esquire and Escheuin, and Master Denis vander Neesen Secretary of
the said City of Antwerp, put in commission about this affair: all which
above named persons knew this wench to have been lame even from her infancy,
and to have been miraculously cured as has been said: as in like manner
thesayd Margarit Nyemege^s declared the same in the presence of the former
persons, comformable to an information taken thereof upon the xijth. of the
said month of December 1603.

The sore eyes of a Child suddenly cured.
ELizabeth Verbiest daughter of Peter Ver^^est Sopemaker dwelling in the City
In Dec. 1603.
of Antwerp upon the Zant, and of Mari^ Speeka^rs his wife, being seven years
old, about Christmasse in the year 1603. had an accident in her eyes for the
space of five or six days, her eyes being very read and inflamed, in so much
that she could not endure the daylight nor any other light, and through the
pain thereof she could rest neither by day or by night, and one of her eyes
was swollen as big as a great nut, and although her parents ceased not to apply
diverse remedies to them, yet no amendment insued thereby. It happened that on a
certain day the chyldes mother met with one la^^ Go^arts the wife of John
Bertells a bleacher of linne^ cloth, dwelling in Antwerp, and talking with her
of the said accident, thesayd la^e gave unto her a little piece of the Oak of
our Lady of Montaigu to use it against the aforesaid disease.

Which the said mother receiving, putting her hope in the help of the Virgin
Marie she steeped the said wood in a little rose water mixed with rain water,
and a little holy water, and with this water she washed one morning her
daughters eyes, who the next night rested very well, not feeling any pain at
all, and upon the day following in the morning, she awaked as perfectly whole
and cured as ever she was before the foresaid disease had happened unto her: in
so much that she went to the school the very self same day, feeling afterward
no manner of grief in her eyes. As her father and mother avouched the same
under their oaths before the Magistrates of the City of Antwerp, upon the
nynth of March in the year 1604* according to an act framed thereof, and
subsigned Vander Neesen Secretary of the said City.

The cure of a sore that was five and twenty years old.
Anthony vande^ Velde keeper and officer In D^^. 1^03
of the forest of So^gne: dwelling in the village of Terhulp three duitch miles
^^o^ Bruxdles was attainted with a quartain ague in the year 1575. which
continued about three or four years, whereby he became so weak and lean that
he was but only skin and bones, Moreover his left leg became so great that
he was not able to walk thereon: and this having continued long, and fynding no
help although he had applied many things thereunto by the adui^e and counsel of
some apothecaries and others, upon a day as he went unto a certain surgeon in
hope to be helped by him, who intending to give some ease to the patie^t, with
a corrisiue medicin made a little hole in the said leg, whereby some water and
moisture began to issue out of the same, but nothing else: and after a while
sundry other yssues began to grow in diverse parts thereof, somtymes on the
one side sometime on the other side of that which was made by the barber. In
so much that in short time al these yssues gatheri^g into one, they made a sore
of the greatness and compass of an egg: and this upon the shinne above the
ankle, being very red, and burning ho^e, and so full of corruption that many
thought the very bone had perished and decayed. And as the patient endured
intolerable pain, he caused diverse other remedies to be applied thereunto,
but all in vain and to no purpose. He also went in pilgrimage to diverse devout
places, and yet obtained he no ease at all thereby. At the last in the year
1603. in the month of December, in the beginning of Aduent having heard some
talk of the miracles which by the intercession of the glorious Virgin Marie
were wrought at Montaigu, the said Anthony much desired to get some piece of
the wood of the Oak wherein the miraculous picture had wount to have been set:
and having by the means of a certain friend obtained a piece, and withal a
silver medall of our Lady of the same place, he put them both into cold water,
and there with he washed his sore for the space of nine days, adding some few
prayers unto God, and to the glorious Virgin Marie. And from the very time that
he began to wash his leg, he perceived that the sore (which he sustained for
fyue-and-twentie years together, with much pain weakness and extenuation of
his body) began to close up, and every day to become lesser and lesser, in
such sort that when the nine days were expired, it was quyte shut up and
healed, and since that time, he has remained in good plight, not feeling
therein any swelling or pain, declaring that from that time he has found his
body in good disposition and health, that he seems to himself to have become
younger then he was before. All which that here has been said he avouched under
his solemn oath before the Magistrates of the City of Bruxelles, upon the
xxjth. of October 1604. And upon the same day appeared also before the said
Magistrates Mistress Gertrude Ianotea^ wife of VVrbert Valle, dwelling at the
Inn called du Ken^ebutin in the same City, and with her Bertr and vanden
Velde brother and Anthonette Baston wife of the said Anthony vanden Velde, who
under the like oaths affirmed that they had often seen the said sore, the which
was very foul and ugly to behold: to wit, the said Mistress Gertrude some
eight years ago, and thesayd Anthonette ever since it first began. As also
they had seen the same sore after he had washed it, and they had found it whole
and cured as has been said: as also at that very time the said Anthony showed
it to the magistrates them selves, who found it to be intiere and whole,
according to their attestation made hereof, sealed with the seal of the said
City, and signed P. Numan Secretary, and dated as above.

The punishment of a soldier that determined to hinder the Pilgrimage of
Montaigu.
IT will not be from the purpose to declare ^n Dec. 1603.
in this place, how that a certain soldier of the gheusos and rebels of
Holland had determined one day with twelve other companions to swim over the
river of Demere, and so to come and kill such Pilgrims as went toward our Lady
of Montaigu, and there withal to rob the jewels and donaries that were offered
there. And for this purpos they had fitted themselves with certain suits of
canuas, that they might be the sooner dry. But meaning first to undertake some
other exploit with these his mates, he was wounded through both his legs by
an harquebuse, in such sort that his determination was dashed. As he himself
(acknowledging his bad intention) declared the same to a certain person of good
credit, whose name we here conceal for that he lives amongst the enemies. And
to say nothing whether this ought to be esteemed for a miracle or no, yet is it
worthy the consideration, to see God his evident providence in this matter.

How a lame woman was cured.
CAtharin Mos^ier wife of John Bailly dwelling in the town of A^h in the In
Dec. 1^0^
country of Henaul^, being in chyldbed, was taken with a certain disease
which caused in her the palsy, and stretching of her sin^wes on her left side,
whereby she became altogether lame, and when she walked it was with great
pain.

Whereupon her husband resolved to go in pilgrimage for her to our Lady at
Mo^ta^gu, to obtain there of our lady his wives health. The Same voyage
being made and his devotion ended, the said woman was perfectly cured of her
halting and lamenes, as it appears by the attestation of the Magistrates of
thesayd town of A^^ dated upon the last of December 1603. signed I. le
Merchier, and sealed with the seal of the same town.

How a possessed person was delu^^red by wood of the Oak of our Laedie.
CAthari^ de Bus daughter of the late In ^^^. 1604.
John de Bus dwelling in the City of Li^le in the Cou^tie of Fla^ters, in the
year 1602. being sixtee^ years of age or therabout was found to have been
possessed of the devil, who by diverse sleightes tru^peries and promises had
deceived and cir^umue^ted her: insomuch that she could be scarce a quarter of
an hour in peace, without being seized upon vexed and troubled by the enemy:
which made her speak (to the purpos) diverse sorts of languages, as Hebrew,
Greek and Latin: as master Michiel le Ca^del Pastor of the Parish of S.
Savior in the City of Lille, and Master Siluester Deuis priest of the same
Church solemnly avouched, as having heard and exorcized the said patient. Who
besides the speaking of these strange languages, did in fury things above all
natural and human force: so that it was necessary to have five or six men
to hold her: who notwithstanding were much troubled to keep and hold her down.
For when they came near unto her with the Blessed Sacrament of the altar she
wrythed and wrested herself strangely, both with her legs, arms, and back,
as with her neck and head, with a terrible countenance, gnashing of her teeth,
and grisely drawing of her mouth. The parents and friends of this wench labored
so much that she was diverse times exorcized, sometimes by certain fathers of
the order of the Capuchins, sometimes by other Priests, unto whom the wicked
spirits answered in diverse languages, confessing at that time that they were
seven in number, they spoke diverse injurious and scandalous things, and told
the faults of diverse that were present. So that one day while this Catharin
was exorcized in a Chapel of our Lady built in the honor of the hows of our
Lady of Lor^tto (which wa^ after the ^east of All Saints in the year 1603)
there was a report in the City of Lille that the town of Ostend (which as
then was kept by the rebels of Holland, and assieged by the army of our
Princes) was surrendered: the enemy was so bold as to say by the mouth of the
wench that it was not true, and that they should see so much ereit were long,
and that those that had bruted it abroad were certain thieves that came from
robbing the Cibo^re of the Blessed Sacrament in the town of Newport the which
they had as yet in their bag, and that the great master A (...) for church
robbers.
compelled them to say so much to accuse their sin. Which was afterward
found true. For upon the self same day two soldiers Suissers were cast into
prison in the said City of Lille, who had blazed abroad the report of the
aforesaid rendering of Ostend and the said Cibo^r was found amongst them, the
which they had stolen out of Newport, whether afterward they were carried, and
there put to death by order of Justice The priests continuing the said
exorcisines, after some four months the patient was delivered of one of those
wicked spirits, and after a while successively again of other three, giving
four evident signs of their departure, by breaking or cracking diverse pa^es
of the glass windo^s as otherwise. Having first and before they departed
thrown out at the mouth of the patient sometimes brimstone, sometimes pinnes
in great number, a bowed piece of silver of five sous, and a great nail of the
length of ones hand. After that again thesayd exorcisines were continued by
thesayd Sir Siluester Denis, both by the entreaty of the wenches parents, as
also by the commandment of the Lord Bishop of Tournay, and in the space of
two months by the ordinary exorcismes of the Catholic Church two other of the
enemies were cast out: and a month or five weeks after, again on other* And
although now seven wicked feendes (according to the number which they
themselves had discovered) were departed, yet the said Sir Siluester perceived
that the enemy had lied, and that the said wench was not yet cured. Wherefore
he ceased not to continue the exorcismes until the beginning of the year 1604,
within the octaues of the Epiphan^^ of our lord: when on a time the said Sir
Siluester exorcising the patient in the presence of a great multitude of
people: the devil began to cry out; and speak to one that was there present
these words. Art thou there also? I know well enough from whence thou come;
and what thou have brought with thee: thou art one of them that has been
visiting Ma^te of Montaigu. It was true that the parents and friends of the said
wench had made a vow to go in Pilgrimage to our Lady at Montaigu to pray
there for her cure. At these words the people began to look about them, who he
should be of whom the enemy had spoken, and there was found a man that was
come from Montaigu, and had brought with him a piece of the Oak of our Lady.
Whereupon Sir Siluester took the said piece; and made the patient to eat it,
and immediately after she had swallowed it, the enemy (who called himself
Ho^illi^, Ch^que^, and Clinq^art) showed himself in her throat, crying out that
he scorched and burned, because of the wood which was eaten: and he added* that
he was compelled to depart, and that there remained in her as yet three: and
being deman^ded by the exorcist by whose merit and intercession he was to
depart? The wicked fee^d answered; of Mar^^ of Montaigu. And afterward being
demanded what sign he would give of his departure? He said: he would burst a
glass of the Church window. And immediately after, two of the^ departed with
the said sign of bursting the glass, and the third saying that he was the
last of ten, cried out (in going forth) with a loud voice. V^^e N. Dame de
Montaigu, qui nous faict sortir. Honor be to our Lady of Montaigu, who makes
us to depart. He being compelled to speak these words (as with reason we may
presume) by M^^. 1. M^^^. 3. Luc 4. (...). ^^.
the majesty and sovereign power of God; even as we have in the Gospel, that
the devils in their departing gave testimony that our Lord Jesus Christ was
the son of God. And in going he plucked out a great nail that was fastened
deep in the wall, the which he threw against the window, but yet touched it not.

And from that day afterward the said Catharin remained whole and perfectly
free from the possession and vexation of the enemy: inioying all her limbs
and senses as freely as ever she did before. And about the beginning of May the
said Catharin accompained with the said Sir Siluester Denis and Peter du ^rieu
her uncle went toward Montaigu, where she remained for nine days, going to
confession and communion and daily visiting the Chapel of our Lady, yielding
tha^cks to God, and to his holy Mother for the mercy which she had received.
And all this that has here been said is manifest both by the deposition and
attestation of the said Catharin, of the said Sir Siluester and Peter du Trieu
made under their oaths before the Pastor of Sichen, Master Anthony de
Bouckhout Maier, and Sir Bartholmew Thichon Chaplain of our Ladies: as also by
an other attestation made and passed under the oaths of the said persons, and
with them of Sir Michel le Candel, and Marie du Bus wife of the aforesaid
Peter, before the Magistrates of the City of Lille, upon the first of June, in
the said year 1604. according to a writing composed hereof, dated as above,
sealed with the great seal of the said City and signed P. Mout^n.

How a Child that was burst was afterward cured.
GErard van Omel wyk-maister of the In May 1604.
City of Antwerp, and Susan VVagemaker, hi^ wife, had in the year 1903. a
child called Lew^s, who from the time that he was sower months old was found
to be burst, in-so-much as his Parents were constrained to bynd him with a
trusse fitted for this purpose: because the rupture came forth oftentimes as
big as a great ball, which put the child to much pain, and his parents to
great sorrow. At last about the end of April, or in the beginning of May, in
the year 1604 the said Susan resolved to go in pilgrimage with he* child to
our Lady of Montaigu, to pray there for his cure: which she performed at the
same time. But being ^n the City of Louain, and reddie to depart thence to
Montaigu, there came tyding* that the troops of the muteners were not far
from Die, and Tillemont, committing there many outrages and insolences.
Whereupon some dissuaded her to go any further as she did not, but stayed at
the said City of Louain. And so perceiving that she could not accomplish her
p^ous intention at Montaigu, went with her child to S Peter's Church in the said
City, and there she caused a mass to be said at our Ladies altar in the
honor of God, and this she did in lieu of her desired pilgrimage: which mass
she did hear deuoutely, praying for her chyldes health. This done she
departed thence, and returned home to Antwerp, where after a day or twain
taking from the chylds body his trusse, she found him perfectly healed:
insomuch that she never needed to bynd him therewith afterward, for so much
(I say) as the child remained in perfect health, as being intierly cured. As
this Gerard and his wife testified and declared under their solemn oaths,
before the Magistrates of Antwerp on the thirteenth of October in the said
year 1604. on which day like w^^e appeared M. Francis van Maldere ^urgeo^,
dweling in the same city, who under the like oath affi^me^ that he had seen
the said child, and that he knew him to have been burst, and how that at this
present he is perfectly healed, for the assurance whereof he had visited and
serched him. Likewise Cathar^^ Briers widow of one Simon Maes appeared there,
who avouched that she had often seen and visited the said child whylest he was
burst, and made for him certain trusses, and how she fyndeth him now healed: as
manifestly may be seen by the information that was iuridically taken hereof,
and subsigned D vander Ne^sen secretary of the said City, and dated as above.

How a blind man recovered his sight.
ANthony de Gro^^e born at Eyckeren near to the city of Antwerp, being ^n
May. 1603.
nine and twenty years old, in the year 1597. in lent, had a great
defluction of a catharre which fell down upon his right eve being then a
soldier under Captain Bourer in the forte of Dam^rugge, nee^e to the said
city. Whereupon he withdrew h^mself to an hospital in Antwerp to be there
healed and assisted: in which place they applied unto him diverse remed^es, and
amongst others, he had ^nyssue made him in the nape of the neck, the which he
did bear for six week, but he profited nothing thereby: yea he lost quyte the
sight of that eye. About some two years after serving again as a soldier under
captain Grysper^^ in a forte near to Callo by Antwerp, there happened him an
other defluxion in his left eye, whereby he lost that eye within the space of
eight days, in so much as the^ he became sta^k blind, and thereby was forced to
forsake his service, and to cause himself to be led to Antwerp, where having
sold all that he had, he sustained his life very miserably, and at last he was
brought to that extremity, that he had no other means whereby to live but by
the charity and alms of good people: making himself to be led up and down the
streets of the same City for many years. But having heard of the miracles
which were wrought at Montaigu, he resolved and made a vow to go thither, there
to do honor to the glorious Virgin Marie, and to pray unto her that he might
recover his sight, if it were for his souls health. And thus afterward upon
the xxviijth of April in the year 1604. he departed in boat from Antwerp to
the City of Macline, accompained with a boy that did lead him, and with
Vincent vanden Ho^t a lame man: and having continued at Macline until the first
of May, they went together to Montaigu, and arrived there upon the next day
after dinner, being Sunday the second of thesayd month. Upon that day they
did their devotions at the Chapel of our Lady of Montaigu, and so upon the
moonday, and tuisday following the said blind man still praying for his sight
and washing twice every day his eyes with the water which is in the said
mountain. Upon moonday he began to feel great pain, shootings, and prickings
in his head, and especially about his eyes. Upon tuisday he went to confession
to Sir Bartholmew Tichon Chaplein of the said place, and received the blessed
Sacrament of the altar: and after dinner upon the same day being the fourth of
the said month of May, about the time of Salve while this Anthony was praying
in the Chapel, and creeping upon all four about the altar, saying some
prayers, he felt as if certain strings had been broken in his eyes, and
therewithal he recovered his sight, being able a little after to marck and know
every thing, and so became better and better: in so much that he could
perfectly see and know all sorts of figures and colors, read, and discern
pieces of money, and go whether soever he pleased, without any to lead him,
even as he was wount before that he fell into thesaid blyndnes. The which the
said Anthony declared and affirmed solemnly under his oath, before the
Magistrates of the City of Bruxelles (returning from Montaigu toward the
City of Antwerp) upon the seventh of the same month of May, in this year
1604. Before whom also upon the same day appeared Vincent vanden Hout who
under the like oath declared that for five years he had seen and known this
blind man in the said City of Antwerp: and how with him he had made the voyage
to Montaigu, where he had miraculously recouerd his sight, as thesayd Vincent
had seen, having been near to him in the said Chapel of our Lady. All
conformable to an act of the said Magistrates composed thereof, and dates upon
the seventh of May 1604 signed P. Numan, and sealed with the seal of thesayd
City. And upon the xiijth of the said month this Anthony de Groo^e being
called into the full assembly of the Magistrates of the city of Antwerp, and
examined concerning his cure, declared under his solemn oath all that he had
sworn before the magistrates of Bruxelles adding moreover, that at what time
he began first to see in the Chapel of our Lady, every thing did seem unto
him to be of a yellow color, which notwithstanding passed quickly away, and
immediately after he enjoyed his perfect sight. Upon the same day appeared
before the Magistrates of Antwerp R^miold of Mansdale Lord of O^sterlans, who
under the like oath declared that for many years ago he had known this
Anthoni^, as having sometimes been his servant, and that he knew right well that
for five years or thereabout he was stark blind, and being blind had been
diverse times at his hows for alms: having seen him often led through the
streets, and to have been with other beggars before the Church doors. Besides
Clement Ionkers Tisser and appeared before the said Magistrates, who declared
and auo^ched that some five years a go this Anthony had complained unto him
even with tears how that he had lost his sight, whereupon he gave him counsel
to repair unto a certain surgeon that dwelt at the golden hand in S. Anthonies
street of Antwerp, to crave his help, and yet for all that he remained still
blind. Also the Almoners of the said City appeared before this assembly, who
affirmed how they had see^ for some years this Antonie being the^ blind to
have been led through the streets, and to beg for alms: and how that
somtymes they had sent for him to their chamber of the poor, giving him some
assistance for his entertainment. And how that being brought to the same
chamber ypon the xxvjth. of April in thesayd year 1604 he gave them to
understand that he was determined to go in pilgrimage to our Ladies of
Montaigu, to beseech God that by her intercession he might recover his sight:
whereupon they wishing him the help and assistence of God, caused the portion
to be delivered unto him which he was wou^t to receive weekly: and how that
since his return having been with them they saw and knew that he enjoyed his
sight, for which they praised and thancked God, giving unto the said Anthony
an extraordinary alms. Finally the said Bourguemaisters, Escheuins and
counselors of the community of the said City of Antwerp (being collegially
assembled) avouched and certified upon the same day that for some years they
had seen this Anthony, blind, and begging alms in diverse places, both at
the gate of our Ladies Church as else where. All this being manifest by the
attestation of the said Magistrates dated upon the said xiij, of May 1604.
subsigned D. vander Neesen, and sealed with the seal of the same City.

How a man being nyntie years old was cured of a rupture.
John Montady born in the Cuntrie of In May. 1604
Angoles^^ in France, being nyntie years of age, dwelling in the City of
Bruxelles, in the year 1602. served as a soldier in the company of Ca(...)
Anse^^. in the Regiment of Count (...) Busq^or: being at the siege of Ostend
in the Cou^tie of Flanders, which town at that time was held by the rebels
against our Princes, standing one night sentenel upon some part of the
trenches, it happened that a canon ball being shot from the town carried away
with it a great piece of wood that was not fart of from the place where this
Mo^tady stood, which came so near unto his body, that forthwith he felt
himself to be inwardly burst by the wynd and air of the said piece of wood: as
a little afterward the rupture showed it self upon his left side: and it so
increaced that within three days space it was as big as a man's head: in so
much as he could not possibly go but with two crutches, the which he used for
two years together. And the weight of the said rupture was so great, that the
skin which was about it began to slit, and was as it were rent in twain. Upon a
time before easter in the year 1604. he seiourning in the City of Lille, and
hearing what was recounted of the miracles of our Lady of Montaign, he
purposed and vowed to go thither to pray for his health. And he departed which
his crutches from Lille at the end of the month of April: and passing by the
City of Bruxelles, upon the viij. of May, he set forward on his way toward
the said Montaign: and he has affirmed that so soon as he was departed from
Lille, he felt his strength to increace, and perceived that he went more
strongly then he was accustomed. Being arrived at Montaign upon the tenth of
the said month, he settled himself to his devotions for some days at our
Ladies Chapel, until the twelfth day, upon which day praying upon his knees at
the time of Sal^e, he felt his said rupture to mou^ in his body as if a child
should stir in his mothers wo^b, and once or twice making a noise, it caused
in him so great pain that he was forced to cry out, at which cry came to him
Sir Barthelmew T^chon Chaplain who raised him up, and standing upon his feet,
he found himself whole and cured: insomuch as there he left his crutches, and
offered them to our Lady, walking with out them and any other help whether
soever he pleased, not feeling any further grief or pain: the rupture
withdrawing it self wholly in-to his body, without leaving any marck or sign
thereof. As the said John Montady avouched and testified solemnly under his
oath, before the Magistrates of the City of Bruxelles, upon the twentieth day
of the said month of May. Upon which day also appeared before the Magistrates
Anthony Capello citizen of the said City, who declared and affirmed under the
like oath, that for the space of two years before he had been very well
aquainted with the said John Montady, and had helped him with some alms: yea
and that diuer^ times he had seen his accident of the bi^nes of a man's head,
as has been said, at which time he went with two crutches, whereas at that
present he saw him go without either crutch or staff: and having at the same
instant visited the place of the said rupture, he found it altogether retired
with-in his body, and whole. All which may appear by the attestation of
thesayd Magistrates, signed P. Numan and sealdd with the seal of the said
City.

How a young wench was cured of the rupture.
CHristina van Schobeke daughter of In May. 1604.
the late Christian Schobeke and of Ant^^^ta van VVeghelen his wife, dwelling
in the City of Antwerp, was found to have been brooken on both her sides, even
from her cradel, and from the time that she was but three weeks old. Whereby
she had infinite incommodites and pains, and principally in her infa^cie: in
such sort that to yield her some help her parents made her wear a trusse,
such an one as is wount to be applied unto those that are broken, and she
continued thus for eight years: to wit, unto the year 1604. At last her
mother having hard great report of the miracles which were wrought by the
invocation of our Lady of Montaigu she resolved to carry thither her
daughter, and there to pray for her health: the which she did, and being
arrived at the place, upon the xix. of June in the said year 1604. they did
their devotions at our Ladies Chapel, and the mother offered that which by vow
she she had promised: and after that she went to wash her daughter with the
water that is in the said mountain. Upon the next day (which was Sunday) they
continued their prayers and washing as they had do^n the day before, and
afterward being come to an Inn to take their refection, the wench began to
complain, that she could wear her trusse no longer, and that she felt it much
to wring her body: which when her mother heard, she carried her again to the
Chapel, there to pray, for her: but so soon as they were entered in, the band
or trusse did break in twain of it self, and fell down to her feet: of the
which her mother caused the Pastor to be advertised by Gertrude VVoest wife
unto John Egh^^s draper dwelling in Antwerp, who was at that present in the
Chapel. And so perceiving that her daughter was healed, she returned with her
toward the City of Antwerp, and the said Christina (being but eight years
old (went six duitch miles on foot without feeling any pain or rupture whereas
before her entrails were wount to come forth on both sides upon never so
little labor or wearines, as has been said.

All this which has been here related was avouched and affirmed under her
solemn oath by the said Ant^ne^ van VVeghelen mother of that broken child,
before the Magistrates of the said City upon the last of June in the said
year 1604. Upon which day also appeared before the said Magistrates sister
Cicilie Cappels dwelling in the Hospital, and Marie Ma^^hys widow to William
vanden Bossche who under the like oath affirmed and declared that they knew
very well that the said Christina some years ago was burst, being brought
diverse times by her mother to the said Hospital of Antwerp to be helped if it
had bee^ possible: where she was looked unto and fitted with her trusse by the
said Sister Cicilie: the said Marie Ma^thys affirming that this Christina swith
her mother had dwelled in her hows more then eight years space, in which time
she had seen her continually with this rupture, until the time whereof we have
spoken: and that she was miraculously cured. All this being manifest by the
attestatio^ of the said Magistrates of Antwerp, dated as above, sealed with the
seal of the said City, and signed D. Vander Neesen.

How a woman was cured of a Rupture.
GVd^la Sc^inck widow to one Martin In ^^^^. 160^.
Alart, who in his life time was a Notarie in the City of Bruxelles, being
threescore and five years old so^ue two and thirty years before was broken
on the right side, by ouerstrayning her self through lifting up from the ground
a bucket of water, she being at that time great with child: and the rupture
came forth of the bigness of a goose egg, insomuch that she was forced to
wear ordinarily a band fit for such diseases. In which thirty two years
space she endured continually grievous pain, and she applied thereunto diverse
remedies, but yet they little profited her to her cure. At last having heard of
the miracles which were daily wrought at Montaigu by the intercession of the
glorious Virgin Mart, she resolved to go thither in Pilgrimage, with very
great hope to recover her health. And so at S. I^h^s tide in this year 1604.
she caused herself to be carried thither by wagon, and having spent there some
days in prayer, she found her self so well, that she left her trusse behynd
her, and offered it to our Lady, and so returned in very good plight to
Bruxelles. not feeling any pain or grief afterward. Some four or five
weeks after that, the said Gudula made an other voyage to Montaigu on foot,
and returned homeward again on foot the rupture never app^^ring: and so she
remains perfectly cured, feeling no manner of pain through her former
disease: she having declared and avouched these things here set down, and that
solemnly under her oath, before the magistrates of the City of Bruxelles, upon
the twelfth of August in the said year 1604. Upon which day also appeared
Misiris Aga^^a ^^^gers, and Margari^^ do M^rod^, as also A^^e van Ni^^^z^l^
their maid, who under the like oath affirmed and avouched that they knew very
well how that the said G^d^l^ had been burst as has been said, because she was
wount to come often times unto their hows, as also for that they had often
visited and assisted her in her malladie, and when she was much tormented with
the said disease. All which ^ conformable to the attestation of the said
Magistrates of the city of Bruxelles, dated as above, and subsigned P. Numan
Secretary.

A very hard disease Cured.
MAster Adrian van Asbrook, sworn In Iu^e. 1604.
clarck of the Amman office, and of the Criminal court in the City of
Bruxelles, and Mistress Catharin Verbeke his wife, had a child called Wiliima,
who in the year 1602. being three months old became full of a certain kind of
eating scabbednes, which the physicians ca^l Herpes exeden^, or corrodens, or
exulcerans: in French Feu volaige graz, in English, the wyld fire, and his
body was spotted therewith in diverse parts and especially, most of all in his
face, ears, the top of his head, and in his left arm: his forhead and all his
face being so over spread with scabbes sore wheales and blisters, yielding
forth a certain corrupt and filthy matter, that there was no place of him
free but only his mouth, in so much as he seemed to have his faco al covered
over with a hard and i^ favored bark, and therewith al it had a certain kind of
inward gnawing, which was so intol^erable, that the child still scratching his
face made the blood together with the filthy matter to run out thereof: a
thing so hiduous and horrible, that every one was much abashed to behold it:
and thesayd child had such continual vehement prickings and pain, that he would
not permit any of the hows to rest, either day or night: and he continued in
this sort more then two years together: at which time his parents caused
in^init remedies to he applied unto him, both by the advice of Surgeons as of
diverse other persons: somtymes of such men or women as took upon them to cure
and heal the like accidents: and somtymes of such as had tried their receiptes
either upon the^sel^esor upon their children: and those persons were not only
of the City of Bruxelles, but also of other Cities near about, as of Antwerp,
and M^clm: from whence diverse sent unto them sundry receiptes, whereby an
hundredth and an hundredth persons had been helped: yea such as had endured the
disease twenty years together. But they found no remedy or amendment at all,
in all the care and diligence that ever was employed. And thi^ accident became
so great and incurable, that it did eat away not only the skin, but also the
very flesh to the bone, which they beheld often quyte bare, both in his arms,
as about the temples of his head, insomuch that the parents were not without
fear that the disease would turn into a leproesie. And they considering how
that no help or invention of man could profit them, they took their recourse to
the mercy of God, and to the assistance and gracious favor of the glorious
Virgin Marie. And hereupon this Asbrook and his wife went with their child to
Montaigu upon the five and twenteth of I^ne, in the year 1604. and having
done their devotions for somedayes at the Chapel of our Lady, home they came
again to Bruxelles, not perceiving that the malladie was any whit amended.
Notwithstanding still confiding in God, and in the assistence of the glorious
Virgin Marie his blessed Mother, they applied unto him afterward no other
remedy or medicin nor any of the receipes which they were wount to use about
him: leaving the child even as he was, yet after a while they began to see and
perceive how that since the said visitation of our Lady the said child began
daily to wax whole, and that all the scabbes botches and blisters went away of
themselves, without any exterior help, insomuch that at the end of fifteen or
twenty days, the disease was quyte gone, the holes and open sores were healed
up, and the child was cured: and his skin and flesh throughout all his body
both on his face neck ears as other parts became so fair and clean as of any
child in the world, no sputtes or scarres remaining afterward, as was
manifestly seen upon the day when this was dated. And all that here has been
said was avouched and verified under their solemn oaths in presence of the
Magistrates of the City of Bruxelles upon the twelfth of August in the said
year 1604. by the said Master Adrian van Asbrook, his wife, Francis van
Asbrook his daughter: Master John H^^^^l lieftenant to the Aman of the said
City, and by Helena randen Eeckhout wife of John Mosselman? who all affirmed
to have seen the said child in so miserable a plight as has been said: yea
that they had seen diverse times how the flesh was eaten away even to the very
bones: and the said Hele^a declared moreover that she had endeavored for the
space of six months or more to cure this child, and that with such remedies
wherewith she had helped above an hundredth persons, and yet in this she could
no whit amend him. There appeered allo upon the same day before the said
Magistrates Arnold Add^ers under Bourgue master of the said City of Bruxelles,
the Lady Marie de Caro^delet, widow of the late Lord de Chassegn^es the Lady
Catharin de Carondelet, widow of the late Coronel Bostock, Mistress Marg-rit de
Bock^out, wife of Coronel Balthazar van Rossum Mystris Agatha Reygers, Mistress
Margarit de Merode. and Master Lewi^ VVinno^x. Surgeon, all dwelling in the
same City: who avouched under the like oath that they had sundry times seen
the said child in such miserable state as before has been declared, they
having administered unto him all the receptes and remedies that they could
devise, and yet without any help or profit at all. And how that someweekes
after the said pilgrimage of our Lady, they found him thoroughly whole, and so
perfectly cured as if he never had been touched with any evil in the world. All
which is manifestly to be seen by the attestation of the Magistrates of the
said city, dated as above, and signed P. Nu^^^ Secretary.

A lame hand cured.
John Courto^s Commissarie of their In ^^^^^. 1604.
Highneses, dwelling in the City of Antwerp some fifteen years ago being in
the Lordship of Hoghstrate in the ^e^pinia was upon a day wounded in the right
hand hard by the wrist, with a blow of a sword, by which blow which passed
through half his arm his sinews were cut in twain: and about the same place
he had received also a thrust. While these hurtes were in curing it happened
that the wyld fire entered into the same arm, and it was inflamed therewith even
to the arme-pitt, whereupon the Surgeons resolved that the arm should be cu^^
of, or else the hurt man should lose his life: but he would never consent
thereunto, rather choosing to die then to be brought unto that extremity, and
thereupon calling* upon the aid and help of the Virgin Marie he vowed to make a
pilgrimage to our Lady of Hall. After which vow within the space of four or
five days he recovered in such sort his strength and health, that he arose
out of his bed, got on horseback, and so came to Antwerp feeling daily his arm
much amended: from Antwerp he went on foot to the said town of Hall and there
accomplished his promis, and so recovered the intiere cure of his said arm
save only that it was lame on the three last fingers and on the thumb, his
hand remaining crooked and his fingers stiff. And upon the fourteenth of July
in the year 1604 he going to Montaigu there to offer his honor and prayers to
our Lady he put himself in the state of grace, communicated, and after some
Masses he was present at the processio^in which the mirac^lous Image was
carried round about the Chapel, and so beseeching our Lord most instan^ly and
his glorious Mother that he might be cured of the said lamenes of his hand, he
gave his beads to the Priest to touch the Image therewith, which the Priest
did, who restoring them again unto him he with great confidence received them
with his said lame hand, the which even by the very touching of thesayd beads
he perceived to be forthwith cured being able to move and shutt it as he
could have done before that he became lame: and from that time his said hand
continued very well, and it serue^h him as fittly as does the other. All this
he himself declared and avouched under his solemn oath, before the Magistrates
of the City of Antwerp, upon the fourth of August 1604. upon which day also
apeared Master Paul van Assel^^rs, Eschoutet of the said City, and Mistress
Ioane* Courto^s his wife, who under the like (...)e assured and witnessed that
(...) kne^ (...) well that the said John (...) ^rother was some fifteen (...)es
be(...)ame of his right hand, in (...) manner as before we have declared, and
how that after the said voyage to Montaigu he was cured, and now has the use
of his said right hand as well as of the left, the which was never hurt. All
which is conformable to an attestation of thesayd Magistrates of Antwerp dated
as above, subsigned D. vander Neesen, and sealed with the seal of the said
City.

The cure of a Rupture or Hernia.
ELizabeth VVouters alias (...)ens Beguyne ^n (...)e (...) ^.
in the Beguinage of the town of Die, in the year 1601 drawing water out of
a well she used such force that she burst herself on both sides, where the
rupture first apeared of the bigness of a turkies egg and afterward of a man's
fist, in so much that she was constrained to wear a trusse enduring often times
much pain, and sometimes she kept her bed for the space of one two or three
months together* and although she had used many medicines and remedies, yet
for all that, she felt no ame^dme^t. Finally considering that she ^on^d no help
by human means, and fearing withal that this disease would hinder her from
being admitted to her profession in the Beguinage, for so much as she was as
yet in her year of probation, she took her refuge to the Mother of God: and in
the year 1604. (having endured this accident for the space of almost four
years) she purposed to go three times to visit our lady at Montaigu to the
end she might obtain thereby her health. And so upon the e^e of S. Marie
Magdalen, to wit, upon the one and twentieth of July in the said year, she
made her first Pilgrimage, and she felt some amendment: upon the day next
following the said feast she returned the second time, and having ended her
devotion at the Chapel and going down the hill toward Die where she dwelt,
it happened that the point wherewith her ^russe was tied on the right side,
broke of it self, notwithstanding that it was both strong and new, which when
she had perceived she mended it and tied it again, and so went on somewhat
forward in her way: but by and by again she being not yet at the bottom of
the hill the other point on the left side did break, which likewise was new,
and this did never so happen unto her before. Whereat being much amazed, and
thinking with herself that our Lord had bestowed some grace and favor upon her
she returned in haste toward our Ladies Chapel, and settled herself again to
her prayers. In which place she felt herself so well that taking from her body
her trusse she left it there for a memory. And from that day she found herself
perfectly whole and cured of her rupture, not feeling afterward any grief or
hindrance thereby. Whereupon she returned on the morrow following for the third
time in way of thanksgiving, and caused a mass to be said, praised God and
the glorious virgin Marie who had obtained for her this favor. All which was
declared by the said Flizabeth upon the fourteenth of October in the said year
1604 in the presence of Master Haymo Timermans Pastor of the said Beguinage Sir
Michiel VVouters, and Lambert Bouwe^^, Chaplanes as witneses, and Mistress
Catharin Maes Begu^ of the said place in Die, with whom the said Elizabeth
VVouters does dwell. And upon the twentieth of the said month of October the
said Elizabeth appearing before the magistrates of the town of Die did sweat
upon her profession that all the premises were true. And under the like oath
have witnessed the same, first Mistress Cat^^rin that she knew right well that
this Elizabeth was burst, and had often kept her bed, having lived with her for
the space of two whole years. And A^ne Sher^^gen a Beguine, likewise affirmed
that the said Elizabieh had sworn the truth which she knew for that she had
accompanied her in the foresaid Pilgrimage to Mo^taig^. All which is evident by
the attestation of the Magistrates of Die, dated as above, subsigned P. van
Zille, and* sealed with the seal of the said town.

How a young man that was borne lame, and of a monstrous shape was cured.
John Clement the son of James of In ^^^^^. ^^^^.
the City of Lucerna in Zuitzerland, being at this present three and twenty
years of age or thereabout, came into this world with a very deformed and
imperfect shape, having his legs wholly fastened against his body, and his
knees thrust so fast against his breast, that non^ could so much as put a
^i^ger betwixt ^^^^^, from the time of his birth unto the time of his cure.
Moreover his thighs and the calfes of his legs were tastned together and
covered under one flesh and ^kinne, together, with his belly and breast:
insomuch that he could not stretch out his legs in any sort. And as some
Germans told him (who had heard it from his Father) that his Mother dyed in
her travail of him, and she was cut up and opened to save the child, His
father feeing this his defect and disproportion indeuo^red by all means in his
chyldhood to help and cure him: and for this effest caused him to be carried to
diverse bathes both in high Germany as also in the kingdom of Hungary, and
yet could he obtain no help. It happened in the year 1594 (at what time
Er^estus Archduke of Austria was governor of the low Cuntries) that a certain
noble man of the kingdom of Pol^nia called ^ob^as Metzka having a desire to
see the low Cuntries and other provinces, admitted the father of the said John
Clement into his service, to serve him as an interpreter, because he was
skilful in sundry languages, for so much as he had followed the wars in
diverse Cuntries: and so thesayd John Clement was carried by his father amongst
this noble-mannes baggage: and coming near to the City of B^isleduke, he fell
sick in a village called Vlyemen: in so much as his Father being constrained
to pass forward with his Lord was forced to leave him there, until such time
as he recovered, delivering him some money for his entertainment. Having dwelt
in this village for the space of fifteen months, and being at last restored
to his health, he was sent for by his Father to come to Bruxelles, where the
said Lord T^bias Metzka as the^ remained.

Whereupon he set himself on the way toward his Father: but understanding how
that there were certain famous bathes near to the City of Aken, he caused
himself first to be carried thither, that he might have the use of them as he
passed by, to try if he might find any help against his evil, and so he
remained for three weeks at the bathes of Boursset near to the said city:
but for all this he received no ease at all thereby. And from thence continuing
his journey forward toward ^r^^^lles he found that his father (being sent
into France by the said Lord Metzka about some business) had fallen into the
hands of certain thieves and robbers by whom he was murdered. Whereupon he
remained in Bruxelles entertaining himself for the space of two or three
months, partly with the mo^ey which his father had left him and partly by the
alms which certain gentlemen and others had given him. After this by boat
he went to An^werp, where likewise he lived by that which charitable people
bestowed upon him, for so much as he was not able to gain his living by reason
of his lamenes, and the want of his limnes. While he lived after this ma^net in
An^werp certain Holland mariners (who were at that time there) asked him if he
would go with them, they would carry him to a place where he should be well
entertained, and have good means to live, Who consenting thereunto was carried
by them to the City of D^rt, where he lodged in a stret called den Cromme^
Ellebege in the hows of John de Spellemaker, and from thence he went to
R^tterdam and so to many other Cities of Holland, as Delf, Leyden, Harlem, and
the Haghe, always going upon his hands with two little stiltes of a hand breadth
or half a foot in height, touching only the earth with the top of his feet
which did hang before his body, and they were very little; and his legs not
three inches thick under his knees, and after this sort had he gone all the
days of his life. While he was in the said town of Haghe he dwelt for the
space of a year in the hows of a Scotish-man who was a labourer unto
briclayers, dwelling in a place called opde^ geest, and in this hows he did ly
in a cradle for so much as when he did ly in a bed (having no use either of his
feet or legs and for that his body was round like a bowl) he did ordinarily
tumble down to the beds feet. From hence he went by boat to many other towns
of Holland, as also of Ze^ad; as Flushing, Camfere, Arm^, and Middelborow,
where he lodged at a hows of a widow called Marie d'Ostend, who dwelled behynd
the Princes court. Also in the City of Breda, where he lodged in a widows hows
that sold small wares, called Catharin, dwelling at Mo^^e-uelt neet to the
prison: he was also in Berges upon Zoa^^, and whereas betwixt this town and
Ter^^le there was a forte upon the water wherein there served certain Almans in
garrison, he found the means to enter into their acquaintance, because he
spoke their language, in which place he lived on free cost for a time: which
was in the year 1596. at which time the Archduke Albert (who at this present
is our Prince) besieged the City of Hulst. Upon a day he being gone out of
this forte, and going with his hand-stilts to a farm hows in the cuntrie to
beg his victualles, the Count Maurice de Nassow accompanied with the Count of
Hollach and others, chanced to pass that way, with certain wagons, and the
said Count Maurice seeing him so monsterous and miserable, demanded of him
whence he was, and how he fell into that impotencie, and having heard the
particularities, he gave him some four or five pieces of gold in alms, and
they were french crowns so far as he can well remember; in like manner the
Count of Hollach gave him some pieces of silver, and the said Count Maurice
commanded him to cause himself to be carried to the Haghe, promising to
provide him of some entertainment: and although he went thither afterward yet
he made no great ^ute for the said entertainment, but rather lived of that
which those ^arles had given him and of that which daily he received of good
people. And so going from one City to an other in Holland for the space of two
years and a half or there about, at last he came to the City of V^^^g^t,
where he lay at a place called Op^ Sant in the hows of one Elizabeth van Dor^:
and as he there frequented certain Catholics, they couseled him not to stay in
Holland where Heretics commanded, but rather eo return to B^uxelles from
whence he came: and that there he might find how to live, and better means of
entertainment, both for his corporal life, as for the exercise of his faith:
and religion, by the good assistance of the gentilitie and other good persons
in that City. Which admonition was of that force with him, that he following
their counsel, resolved to return thithe^* and thereupon he caused himself to
^e carried to the Cities of Bour^^^l, He^sden, and the aboue-named village of
vli^^^^n, and at length to the City of B^isse duke, where the Curate of S.
^^^^s upon charity entertained him for the space of a whole winter. And the
winter being ended, he procured that he might be carried by wagon to the
City of Gr^^^, and to Venlo, and from thence he came to VVaghtendo^ck whereof
the Lord of Gelain had the commaunderie, who nourished and entertained him for
the space of six months Afterward the said John Clement made himself to be
carried to Aken, where again both in the same town as also in the aforsayd
Boursset, he used the baths for nine or ten days together, but yet nothing
advanced his cure thereby. From thence passing by Maestright. T^ngres, and
other Cities, he came to Bruxelles: where he made his stay, entertaining
himself upon alms, and by cutting little wooden crosses and tooth-pickers
which he sold. His limbs still remaining in the same monstrousnes and
disproportion as they were even at the beginning, creeping upon his hands with
his little stilts upon the ground as has been said, sittyng daily at the foot
of the stairs which mount up to the Princes pallais, where for many years
together, thowsands and thowsands, of people have see^ and known him in the a
foresaid plight, and assisted him with their alm^s, as they passed by. At last
in the year 1601, certain persons of the said City moved through charitic and
compas^^on toward him, found means to have him learn the art of painting,
that there with in time ^o come he might goine his living: and this was done
by the assistance of the Almoners of the Church of S. James in C^^berghe and by
other charitable people, procuring him moreover that she should have in certain
howses every day a meals meat, Having been therefore about some two years
and a half in the hows of Anthony va^der ^^^^^ painte^, to learn that art, and
heari^g often the miracles recou^ted which by the intercession of the glorious
mother of God were wrought at Montaigu, he had a desire to go likewise thither
in pilgrimage, and to offer his prayers to the V^gi^ Marie that she would
procure him the cure of his body, or at leastwyse that he might go with two
crutches, or rather that ^e might have some better use of his limbs, and that
he might not be forced still to draw them a long the g^ou^d as to that time he
had done* whereunto also diverse of his friends exhorted him. And about some two
months before he took upon him this journey lying at that time in the prince
of Orange his stable, twyse in one night, either in vision or in sleep, he
thought that he had been at ^onta^g^, and that he could have stood upright upon
his feet, which did breed in him a greater desire and devotion to go thither
the^ before: and so he asked leave of his Master, who ^erie willingly yielded
thereunto. But whylest he was in doubt by what way or means he might go
thither, by reason of his unableness, soon after an occasion was offered: for
that Michiel vander Hage^ keeper of the wyne-seller in their Highnesses pallais
in the said City of Brux^lles had received some store of wynes from Cullen:
whereupon the said vander Hagen commended him to the carters, that when they
returned they would take him up into one of their empty carts. and so carry
him to the town of Die: which they did, upon the third of July in the year
1604. and they lodged that night at the Emperor in the City of Lo^ain: and
upon the next day following they took their way to D^^^^, together with the
said lame yongman. And being come to a certain place called H^l^^^rb^s, where
the way of Montaigu is divided from that of Die, the carter that had brought
him thither took him down, thinking that he would easily have found out the
way, and so forwards toward Die they went with their carts: but after they
had gone awhyle on their way one of the said carters called Laure^^ D^^^er in
wardly moved with compassion, and fearing that God would punish them for their
little charity used toward this miserable creature who (being not able to go
but only creeping with his little hand-stil^s) might fall in danger to be
devoured by wolves, dogs, or other wyld beasts, he felt so great a remorse of
conscience, that he speedily returned with his cart, and having found him
almost in the place where they left him, up he set him again, and carried him
to Die to the Inn of the Swan: as the same carters being afterward
returned with new loding to Bruxelles declared to diverse persons of credit.
Upon the day following which was moonday and the fifth of July) in the morning
the host of the swan ^^^^ured that he should be carried to the Chapel of our
Lady at Montaigu, where being entered into a certain lodging or cottage, the
master of the hows as he beheld him in this monsterous and strange shape,
being much amazed thereat, began to say that he much woundred that such an one
as he would come thither upon any hope to be cured: not for that he doubred of
the power of God, but because it seemed unto him a thing very extraordinary
to obtain the cure of so admirable an accident. For all this the said John
Clement went incontinently to the Chapel, where he heard two or three masses,
after he went to confession and communicated, and about an hour after he had
communicated he began to feel a saddenes and feeblenes at his heart, and withal
certain grievous and excessive pain in all the parts of his body, in so much
that the sweat issued out of him even from his head down to his feet: and
thincking to go out of the Chapel to take the air he became much weaker:
whereupon he returned and remained in prayer all that day. In the mean while
his pains increased continually until the evening after the Sal^^, at what
time being before the altar of our Lady in his devotions, he felt himself
inuisibly lift up from the ground, and his legs which before were fixed and
fastened to his body and shrouded within his dublet as has been said, fell
down, and of themselves violently opened the said dublet, and so he found
himself standing upright upon his feet, wherea^ he was much astonished, and
ceased not to praise God and his holy mother for the mercy that was showed to
his unworthiness. And as he happened to be somewhat faint in this alteration,
he fell with his hands against the altar, but was helped by those that were
there present and placed in the confession seat, whylest they brought him some
apparel, and especialy breeches, because at what time his legs fell down and
that his dublet was opened by force, in like forte that piece of cloth
wherewith he was wont to cover his body below and whereupon he did vs^ to
sit, was torn in pieces also. Moreover at the same instant the said John
Cl^^^^^^ was healed of a wound in his head, which he had gotten some fifteen
days before, and was not healed until that very time, having at his departure
from Brux^^les brought with him six plasters to apply thereunto, the which at
the very self same time was found so well and perfectly cured and healed, that
there was no need that any should put their hand thereunto. And all this
happened in the presence of many persons, who came from diverse places, and can
bear witness of this sudden and unexpected cure. A little while after, the
said John Clement was was led (by two or three persons for so much as he was
very weak) to the Inn of the Angel, going upright upon his legs and feet,
which he was never able to do in all his life before: feeling a certain force
and vigor to descend incontin^tly into his legs, yea and a certain
augmentation thereof. And the host of the aforesaid Inn repenting himself of
his forme^ opinion, took forthwith the mesure of the legs of the said lame
youth, and some two hours after he measured them again and he found that
betwixt the time of the first and second measuring, his legs were grown
bigger and grosser by three inches: and after that time they began to ^spy his
she^^es and vai^^e^ to appear in his legs, which were never seen there
before* And so leaving his said h^dstil^s in the Chapel for a memory, he
resolved to stay there for the space of nine days, going daily to the said
Chapel, and there hearing divine service: walking the first two days with a
staff, but on the other days without either staff o^ other help. A day or two
after the said cure this John Clement having got a clean shert, and looking
upon the place^ where his legs did hang from his body he found that the
holes and pittes within the which his knees did rest and hang against his
breast, began to be filled up with flesh, and where his thighs were fastened
there the color was as red as blood* and it put him to pain at what time so
ever he touched it* but after a little while all this pain passed away. And
during the time that he remained at Montaigu he was visited by diverse persons
from Die (who before had seen him so miserably lame and deformed) and now saw
him go upright: and amongst others he was twis^ visited by Count Fr^derik
vanden Berghe, to his great admiration at so notable a miracle. And upon the
fifteenth* of Iuli^ he returned by wagon to Bruxelles, at the entrance of
which city he went some part of the way on foot until he came to the Church of
the Co^berge, where (...) De^^ was sung and thancks given to God for this
marvelous woork, which it pleased him to woork in this person by the
interoession of his holy Mother. And upon the eighteenth of the said month,
this John Clement was present with (...) white wax taper in his hand at the
procession of the Holy Sacrament of miracle, the which is yearly made upon
that day: and he walked upright before the blessed Sacrament in the sight of
many thowsa^ds of people who at that time were in the said Gi^ie of Bruxelles,
yet he went but a part of the way because he was yet weak and with pain in his
legs, wherein he felt a continual stretching, and an inward working in his
snewes and veins, his legs and feet still growing, and howerly increasing
both in flesh and strength. Upon the same day being sent for to appear before
the right reverend Father in God, the Archbishops grace of Maclin, who at that
time was in the same City, all the contene^ hereof were read v^nto him, the
which under a solemn oath he affirmed to be true, in the presence of the said
Lord Archbishop, of M. P^^^er Vi^cki^s D^^n^ of the Christianity of Bruxeller,
Master Theodore (...) Dean of the Christianity of Al^s^, Master James de
Sasseg^^, and Master Martin (...) Chaplaine^ to the said lords grace, also of
Master (...) drossard of Cocuord and Master Herman ^^^ E^^^^ his brother. And
upon the nine and twentieth day of thesayd month of ^^^^^ the same John Clement
appeared before the whole court of the Magistrates of the City of Bruxelles,
where in the presence of the Bourgema^^ers, Escheuins, Receauers and Counsel of
the said City, Collegially assembled, h^ ^^ouched again under his solemn ^the
all that we have here related: the same having been once more read unto him by
the Secretary.

And upon the same day appeared before this assembly Master William de C^ni^ck
(...) inhabitant of the City of Bruxelles, and practitioner of physic and
surgerie, who after they had showed unto him this John (...), he affirmed and
declared under the like oath that some three year^^ and a half past (...) there
about going with his wife toward the Court or the Princes Palace in the said
City, he found him ^itting (...) the foot of the stairs there, and
considering how strangely he was lame and impotent, he had a desire to behold
more particulerly his accident, and thesayd John Clement vnbuttening his dublet
and showing unto him his body, the said master William found that his legs
(which were very little and slender) did hang against his body and that his
knees were thrust and made fast against his breast he saw moreover (for that he
had curiousely searched him with his hands) that his thighs and calfes of his
legs did grow all under one flesh and s^m together to his belly, and the
forepar^e of his body against which part his said thighs were ^astned: and
his feet did hang right down to the ground, the said John Clement, having
standing hard by him two little stiltes where with he did help himself as he
went upon his hands, and so he giving unto him an alms and the best comfort
he could, departed and went forward on his way* There appeared also on the same
day and in the same place Master Anthony ^ander Mercu Painter, who under the
like oath declared that for the space of some eight and twenty months the said
John Clement had learned under him the art of painti^g in which time he had
caused him twyce or thryse to open his dublet, and to show him his body
thereby to see his defect: and he had found that his thighs were fast in one
flesh and skin with his body, and that he could not move his legs, but
only that he could open and separate the one leg a little from the other,
setting or laying them toward the one or other arme-pit, and that he never went
but upon his hands with his two little stiltes of wood. Moreover there appeared
at the same hour and place John de Grieck who learned to paint of this Master
Anthony, and also under his oath affirmed, that during the time that the said
John Clement was his fellow prentice, they had been twyse at two several times
at the river called la Senne to wash and bathe themselves (the lame youth
always holding fast to the b^nck of the river,) and thereby he had seen his
naked body, and perfectly beheld that his thighs and calfes of his legs
were fastened under the same flesh and skin against his belly and breast, so
that he could not stretch out his legs. At the same time also appeared before
the said assembly of those magistrates Michie^ Hardy painter dwelling in the
same city, who under a solemn oath declared that he had wrought for some time
in the hows of Master Anthony with the same John Clement, whom he knew to have
been so lame and impotent that he could not go but only upon his hands with
two little stiltes. And how that four or five times he had been with him at the
river to wash themselves: upon which occasion he had seen his naked body, and
well and perfectly marked and considered that his legs (especially about his
thighs) were fast and fastened to his body before with the self same flesh
and skin, his legs hanging down his body, even as a woman's pappes hang from
her breast, in such sort that he could never stretch them forth, the which he
had marked diverse times. There appeared also upon the same day and in presence
of the aforesaid Magistrates Catharin de Tournay the wife of Andrew van Zeele
dwell ling in the said City, who likewise affirmed and declared under her oath
that thesayd John Clement had lodged for some months in her hows, during
which time she had seen three or four times his legs, and she had found that
they were fast, and hanged from his body: his thighs having but one flesh and
skin with his belly and breast, insomuch that he could not stretch them
forth: whereupon he was forced to walk and creep upon his hands, holding two
little stilkes of wood, as very often she had seen him. Upon the same day also
appeared before the said Magistrates Francis le Feb^re, wife of Francis van
Schut^epit, painter, who under thelyke oath affirmed and testified that the
said John Clement had lodged in her hows for the space of four or five
months: lying in a hutch or chest wherein they had made bread: in which time
she had at two sundry times seen and perfectly beheld his legs which were
very small and ^lender, and hanged hard to his body, and his thighs were
fastened to his belly with the self same flesh and skin, so that he could
not possibly stretch them forth at length. Declaring moreover that upon the
fifth of (...) in this year 1604. she came from Bruxelles to Montaigu, and
that after dinner upon the same day that this John Clement arrived there in the
morning from Die, and whereas he was miraculously healed that very evening,
she with some others aided and assisted him in his necessities, affirming that
immediately after his cure he withdrawing himself a side, showed unto her the
pieces of skin which remained hanging from his body about the places where his
thighs had been fastened, as has been said, he inquiring of her whether he
should cut them away or not: whereupon she answered him that he should let them
remain there still, expecting what God would dispose thereof. And upon the
second day of August in the same year 1604* there appeared before the
Magistrates of the City of Louain John de Socthem, the host of the Inn at the
sign of the Emperor in the said City, who under his sole^n oath declared and
avouched how that upon the third of July in the same year through the
commendations of Mychael vander Hagen, a certain young man that was
mo^sterously deformed called (as he understood) John Clement came to lodge in
his hows whom when he saw to be so monsterous and deformed in his limbs that
he went upon his hands with two little stil^es, he desired to see his accident,
and having made him to open his d^blet the said host found that the legs of
the lame youth were not past three inches thick, so far as he could remember
(whose legs not-with-sta^ding at this present are more then fourteen inches
about) and that they were fast and hanged by his thighs against his breast and
belly, and were so far thrust in and that with a certain kind of hollownes
that none could put his hand, no not so much as his finger betwixt, and that
his knees did ly against his breast and were covered with the skin of his b^est
as he had seen and felt them with his hands. Affirming moreover that as this
search was made in the presence of the carters who had brought him from
Bruxelles, they made a mockery that thesayd lame fellow would go to Montaigu
with any hope that our Lady would obtain any cure for him: telling and
persuading him that it was a frivolous matter: yet for all this he continuing
in his good purpose, procured himself on the next day following to be conuayed
to Die and from thence to Montaigu as has been said. All these prem sses
being manifest by the attestations and publik wrytings both of the City of
Bruxelles, subsigned P. Numan Secretary, as also of I^o^atn subsigned R. de
Prince Secretary, dated respectively upon the xxix. of Iulie, and the second
of August 1604. and sealed with the s^ales of the said Cities.

Well here I must needs call upon you (Christian brethren) who under pretense
of following a reformed Religion, have left the assured foot-steppes of your
forefathers, and that royal way wherein so many Martyrs and Confessors, so many
holy Bishops and Doctors, so many Priests, E^emites, Monk, and Religious
people, and so many honorable souls have walked: whose most holy memories yet
replenish the world. You (I say) that have forsaken the lively fountain and
have dug to your selves stinking pittes and cesternes, who h^^e left the
fat and fertile pastures of the ancient Church, and raunge up and down the
barren de^ettes of your own novelties, and who in ste^d of eating the delicious
fruit of the tree of lyre, gnaw on the dry bark of your subtle though vain
inventions. Behold the glorious brightness of the Catholic Church: and withal
behold the place of our own abode, and consider with your selue^, if you have
not forsaken the hows of God, and have not gone to adore in Bethel and Galgal^,
there to serve the Idol^ of ou^ own obstinate opinion^: whereby you persuade
your selves, that for the space of a thousand years and more, there has been
no faith or right belief or true church in the world, wherein the fathful
might hope or procure their salvation: but that all was depraved corrupted and
marred until some fifty or threescore years ago, when first forsooth was
brought in the reformation and heavenly light, contrary to the word of our
Lord who said when he first planted his Church, that the gates (to wit, all
the power and policy) of hell, should never prevail against it. Faith
well-beloved is not as a proclamation or as a text of the civil law, which every
one may explicate and interpret at his pleasure, and which may be altered and
realtered upon every occasion, and according to the diuer sities of times.
Faith is the marck wherewith every one must present himself before his eternal
Judge at the last dreadful day, if you be defective herein, there shall be
granted you no appeal, you shall never after be able to remedy or repair the
fault, but all shall be quyte lost for all eternity. O terrible eternity o
dreadful word, O incomprehensible eternity, O infinite depth and profunditie
either for weal or woe, either for glory or pain, and yet you make no more
difficulty to change your faith and religion then one would make to change his
shert or co^t What assurance, what testimony, what proof, have you of your
pretended reformation? In the Catholic Apostolik Romain Church we have the
marks of the true and sincere doctrine, we have the assured seals of the
truth: miracles (I say) the heauenely ^estifications and impressions of the
souerame hand of Almighty, God. Whom ought one rather to believe, the chatting
of a babbling tongue, fortified with nothing else but the credit and tradition of
one c^ept out of the shel but yesterday, and the antiquity of half a hundred
years, or rather those who teach a doctrine of sixteen hundred years old, and
the words of those which we see daily to be confirmed by certain admirable
supernatural works of almighty God, who does vouchsafe us the^. These are the
true proofs unto which our lord referred the Jews when they would not believe
him. Unto these proofs, unto these woorks (Sirs) we remitt you in like manner:
consider here the hand of God, believe heerby that the true Church is not
perished and decayed, as you dream, and withal understand, how you have
embraced darkness in steed of the truth it self: I know that the hoatest and
flelshliest companions amongst you will say that all this is but coosenage,
forcerie, and the woork of the devil: but this was and is the old song of the
Jews heretics and pag^s, against the Christian and Catholic Church in every
age, when you shall be able to do so much be it by what force or virtue soever,
we will also make esteem of your argument: in the mean while you shall content
your self with the answer which our Lord gave to the said Jews when Mat 12.
Man 1. Luc. ^^.
they in like sort reproched him: for thereby the euer-lasting wisdom of God
thought that he had given a sufficient solution for such an ob^ection. But I
beseech you (brethren) lay aside for a while the fume of your passions which
transporte you. Enter into your own consciences, and ponder with your selves if
you have not occasion to thinck that we walk in the right way of the truth
(seeing that God yields such a^ple proofs and ^n^firmations thereof amongst
us) and that you are in danger to ^cu^^e the perdition of your own soul, and
of your everlasting salvation. Can it be possible that all these admirable
things can be the woork of the devil? Ca^ he restore the sight to the blind?
the hearing to the deaf? is he able to cure the afflicted with the palsy? in a
moment to make the canckers, botches, and other incurable diseases to vanish
away? Has he the power to creat new limbs, flesh and blood in the bodies of
creatures? as you may see in the cure of the lame youth of three and twenty
years old, who had no legs to walk upon. Truly if his power could reach unto
this, he had do^ne it many ages ago, and so the true miracles of our Savior
and of his Apostles should have had no force to woork the conversion of the
Gentiles, but all would have been turned into vanity and ridiculous foolerie,
when the devil should have done as much for his own part, as Christ and his
Apostles had done for their doctrine, that so the world should not have been
converted, which he held under his tyrannical yoke. No it is too gross an
error to have such a cogitation, and it makes that miserable damned creature
equal to the souerain God of heaven. And what commodity could this sworn
enemy of mankind draw out of this his proceedings: Is it lykely that he will do
any thing whereby the world should be incited the more to honor and serve God;
bear reverence to the Virgin Maric: and adict it self to works of virtue and
sanctity? Is there any man in his right wits that does believe this? It is
no other, it is no other (friends) but the woork and* mercy of God, who in
these latter days amongst so many shelues and rocks of errors sets before
us a Pharus or Beacon, a light from heaven, a Cynosura or celestial star, an
infallible mark by the steadfast contemplation whereof we are to direct the
course of our navigations in this life, if we will not utterly perish. It
appertains unto us to yield him infinite thancks for the same, and in such
sort to frame our lives that he will vouchsafe to continue and increase toward
us this his mercy, It is your duty (brethren) to open your eyes and to behold
the sun which ryseth so brightly shyning, for if (notwithstanding all this
light) you will persevere in the obscure night of your darcknes, you shall be
judged inexcusable, and are like one day to feel the terrible and heavy hand of
the Almighty upon you for the same.

The Cure of a flux of long continuance.
In Aug. 1604.
SIster Marie Heyt^eyers a Conuers Religious woman of the Cloister of Herkenroy
in the Cou^tie of Loon, in the cuntrie of Liege, was taken with a flux which
continued without cease for the space of more then a year and a half, in
somnch that she kept her bed for a long time. For the remedy whereof she
used first the counsel of the mistress of the infirmarie, and of other relig^ous
women of her Convent, and afterward the advice and counsel of Master Henry van
Roy Doctor of physic, dweling at S. Trone. Afterward of Doctor Herman
Gr^ffenroy, who came from the city of Liege, of an other Doctor in the town of
Hasselt called Some rius, a certain Surgeo^ called M. No^ld' Arthois of an
other of Sittert, of a certain woman of the said city of S. Trone, by the advice of all these she took many drincks, receptes, and medicines, but all in
vain, and without any profit, the said flux still continuing without cease,
being for the most part of blood; and she thought she should have voyded all
her bowels, having had and that very often times, above thirty stools within
the space of a day and a night. Whereby perceiving herself past all hope of
recovery by any human means, she took her recours to almighty God, and to
his holy Mother the Virgin Marie, and so in the year 1604 she promised to go
in pilgrimage to Montaigu, to which place she transported herself within a
little while after, and there having done her devotions, she returned homeward
with some more ease the before, howbeit she was not perfectly cured. But
being come home to her Convent, and continuing her devotions toward the
Virgin Marie for some nine days space, settling her heart and intention toward
the miraculous place of Mo^taigu, upon the nynthe day (which was in the month
of August) after dinner, she felt a marvelous and miraculous alteration in her
body, in so much that she thought she had as it were a new body, and from
that instant the said flux ceased, and thesayd religious woman remained
perfectly whole and cured. After which cure she has been twyce ^t Montaigu to
thank God for his favor, and his holy Mother for her assistance, the patient
daily recovering her streng^h. All which ^ppeareth by the attestation of the
Maier and sworn men of the place and Convent of Herkenroy, who had the
examination of the said Sister Marie, and of other witnesse^ that could well
testify the sames: dated upon the twelfth of October in the said year 1604
and sealed with the seals of the lady Abbess and of the ma^er and sworn
persons of the aforesaid co^ne^t.

How upon the seventh of September the place of Montaigu was invaded by the
Rebels of Holland.
Our Lord therefore thus daily continuing his miracles and marvelous woorks,
whose glorious beams did not only shine in Bravant, and in other near
neighboring contries, but did shoot out even unto Holland, and other places
held by the heretics and rebels against our Princes, and the enemy of
mankind perceiving that by this way his kingdom began to be troobled, and that
by these so evident and infallible testimonies not only they who in some sort
wauered, or doubted of their Catholic faith were confirmed, but that those also
who were missed and erred in their Religion, would thereby come to the
knowledge of the true faith, and so forsake those darck mistes of error
wherewith they were en^^ironed. This our ghostly enemy (I say) inflamed with
anger and envy against the holy Mother of God, endeavored so much that he
incited certain Captains and cheefs of the rebels that upon a sudden (and
whylst our army and men of war were employed in the county of Fla^ders both
about the taking in of Osted as also in resisting the rebels who were planted
before the town of Scluse) they might go to surpryse, burn, and destroy the
Image and Chapel of our Lady of Montaigu. And so having assembled together
some eight hundredth or a thousand horse from the Cities of Breda and Bergues
upon Soam, they came upon the eve of the Nativity of our Lady, being the
vijth. of September, 1604. in the night to the banksyde of the river of Demere,
through the which they having waded at a certain place not far from the town of
S^chen, (the water being then very ^ow) they thought to have surprysed the
place and all that was therein a little after midnight, before that any should
discover them: but whereas an hour or two before they passed over the river,
those of Montaigu were advertised of their enterprise, they had opportunity to
save the miraculous Image, and the best vestures and ornaments of the Chapel.

When the Heretics were arrived at Montaigu they began to belch out infinite
blasphemies, and horrible injurious words against the Mother of God; and
casting themselves furiously into the Chapel, they broke the images, pictures
and painted tables that remained: they burnt the foormes, chestes, seats of
confession, and other things that were of wood, and yet the Chapel took no
fire, allthough they labored to burn it also. And taking no compassion at the
tears and waylings of the poor inhabitants, consumed with fire all their,
howses cottages and baraques in the mountain, they robbed certain women (that
were come thither in pilgrimage, and had remained there all that night to the
end that on the next day they might the better at^e^d to their devotions)
spoiling them of their rings, jewels, money, and such like stuff, and some men
they took whom they carried away with them, but those were very few. And so
making their retreat with the glory of so honorable an exployt they passed
further within the country and so returned into the Campigne and from thence
every one to his own quarter, with small gayn and booty, but yet with the
honorable title of howsburners, Image-breakers, and persecutors of the Mother
of God, and of her who brought us forth our aeternal salvation, and who with
her own flesh and blood nourished the body and flesh of the Savior of the
world, by which he saved and redeemed us. A woork which at that great day of
judgment must expect of the sovereign Judge (who is her son) such a guerdon
and recompense as any man of judgment may well imagine: seeing amongst mortal men
there is none so simple or base minded that can behold his own mother abused
and unworthily iniuried without some inward feeling thereof. Which thing all
they who have any way consented or assisted unto ought seriously to consider.
Also the report is (not that we affirm it for an assured truth) that many of
these gallants have already experienced ^he revenging hand of God upon them. And
truly if this be not come upon them alredie, let them assure themselves, that
by how much the later it is before they feel the hand of God, by so much the
heavier will it fall upon them. But what has the devil gained (thinck you) by
this affront; but only that the affection and devotion of good Catholics is
grown much greater, and more fervent toward the glorious virgin Mother of God,
and that the visitation of this holy place has been sithe^s as much frequented
and continued as ever it was before, and that in steed of a few poor little
sheddes and cottages now you may see diverse good complete howses. And without
all doubt Satan labors in vain to extirpate and root out that which has
been planted by the hand of the Almighty: let him spyte at it, and let him
gnash his teeth as much as he will against it, his malice shall be turned upon
his own head, and this glorious woman this Lady whom enough we can not pryze,
whom we serve and honor, shall by the holy fruit of her womb crush the head
both of him and of all his adherents and consortes.

A Cure of the Dropsy and other diseases.
MArie Gerbrants, the daughter of Gerbrant In Sep. 1604.
Hessels, dwelling in the City of Amsterdam in Holland, was for the space of
mo ethen three years afflicted with the dropsy, and for two whole years she
was in that case that she could not walk in any manner, neither without
crutches nor with them, having all her body full of water, her legs swollen and
as stiff as stakes, and so gross that her heels could not be seen. Besides
this, she had an accident in her right side above the hip, as if some of her
sinews had been ouerstrained and ouerwrested, causing the place to swel as big
as ones filt, which did much trooble her. And although she had used the advice
of a certain Doctor of physic, and that for a whole year, yet he could do her
no good, insomuch that he told the patient plainly that he knew no means
whereby to help her. Afterward in the year 1604. about Easter having heard of
the miracles which were do^n at Montargu she was very desirous to go thither,
and to pray there unto our Lady for her health, And at last she set her self
on the way in the company of one Be^uard Adrtans^n the ordinary messager of
Amsterdam, with whom she came to Antwerp upon the seventh Of September in the
same year 1604. and lodged in the hows of mistress Angel^ d^ Por^^s, at the
white flowr de luce in the K^^ser st^ate, and upon the same day* she taking boat
departed toward the City of Maclin, together with two young maids whose names
were Susan v^d^r Schueren, and Anne de Duyue. From Maclin by wagon they went
toward Mo^taigu where they arrived upon the seventh of the said month, being
the eve of the Nativity of our Lady. On the same evening the said Ma^t^
Gerbrants, went to confession with intention to communicate upon the next day,
and to perform her devotion, and for this purpos she remained that night in
the mountain: but whereas on the same night the soldiers of the heret^c^l
rebels of Holl^^d ad ^ass^d over the ^^uer, and were come to de^^^oy and ruin
the place, and that our people were advertised of their com^^g* (...) Mar^e
(about two of the clock after midnight) with her company put themselves
quickly into the wagon and with all speed possible fled to save themsel^es in
the City of Louaine. And they being in the wagon the patient perceived that
the swelling and accident in her ^hi^ was gone and cured, feeling verte little
pain there of: and on they went the next day to (...), where the said Mar^e
continued until the fifteenth of the said month of September, and then again
she took her way toward Montaigu, having in her company the said* (...), and
Joan F^erlinc^, and on the day following they arrived there, upon which day
they confessed and communicated, praying ^e^^ou^ely in the Chapel of our
Lady, and that evening they went to lodge in Dust, the said Marie at that time
going with two crutches. Upon the day followig they returned to Montaigu, and
again they did their devotions in the Chapel. And as the patient prepared her
self to go to the aitar to receive the blessed Sac, ame^^ she found herself so
confort^d and stre^gthned that she went thither without any help of her
crutches. They having ended their devotions put themselves into their wagon,
toward the which she also walked without her crutches, leaning only upon the
said Anne de Du^ue. And on the next day (which was saturday) being in the
city of Maclin, the said Mar^e was so strong as that she went without either
crutche or any other help from her lodging to the Church of S. Rombold, where
she was present at our Ladies mass. Upon the same day she arrived at
Antwerp, and daily ever after she found her self better and better, and all
the swelling of her legs and body ceased and went away, ^hee not having any
kind of e^ection or voyding of the water that was therein, insomuch that the
bodies of her coat which before her cure could not be drawn together, was
found that by a quarter of an ell it was afterward too great for her. Together
with this grace which she received at Montaigu she also obtained an other,
which was the curing of a certain disease called Schu^ erburck (a malladie well
known in Holland) wherewith at the very selfsame time she was grieved. In
so much as within seven or eight days she was perfectly cured of all her
accide^ts, as she is even at this present. Wherefore upon the last of the said
month of September she returned the third time to our Ladies at Montaigu, in
the company of the aforesaid Mistress Angela de Portis to render thancks to our
Lord, and his holy Mother for this his work of mercy, and for a memory, there
she offered up her crutches. All which appears by the testimonies and oaths
solemnly made before the Magistrates of the City of Antwerp, both by the said
Mart Gerbran^s, and Anne de Duyue, as also by Mistress Susan vander Schueren,
and Mistress Angela de Portis, according to an information taken hereof upon the
seven and twentieth of September, and upon the fourth and xxjth. of October in
the said year 1604. Subsigned D. vander Neesen Secretary of the said City.

A Rupture cured.
GOdfrey Ruthinck of Borkelo, receauer for their highnesses in Geldres had a
son called Lu^ert, of the age of twelve years, who in the year 1604. was so
beaten and and trodden under foot by an other boy in Geldres, that he was burst
on both sides: wherewith his parents much agrieued caused M. Iose Kinck surgeon
inhabitant of the said town to be sent for, that he might help and cure the
child if it were possible, who having visited him, applied for the space of
three weeks certain oils and plasters unto him, which are good against that
disease. But his parents pe^c^auing that nothing profited him they took their
refuge to almighty God, and to his holy Mother: promising to make a Pilgrimage
to our Lady of Montaigu. And hereupon the wife of the said Godfrey went
thither with her child, and arrived there upon the tenth of August in the same
year 1604* and having for some time done there her devotions, as she
returned home toward the said town of Geldres, she perceived in her way that
her chyldes disease was amended, and being come home she caused the foresaid
surgeon M. Iose Kinck to be called for* to see the child. Who having seen and
visited the place of the disease in the presence of diverse persons, he found
him perfectctly healed, as he is even at this present. The which both the said
Godf^ey and his wife, and the said M. Iose Kinck Surgeon avouched and affirmed
under their solemn oaths, before the Magistrates of the town of Geldres, as it
appears by the attestation of the said Magistrates given hereof, and dated
upon xxth. of October in the same year 1604. subsigned I. Richard, and sealed
with the seal of thesayd town.

How a lame woman was cured.
MArie Martin widow of John Thiry, In Aug. 1604.
dwelling in Ligny near to Fleru in the County of Namur, being fifty and
four years old, some five years ago in a night became so lame that she
could not move her self, and this happened her especially in her left leg, in
such sort that she was forced to use two crutches, for without them she
could not go. And to* the end she might be healed, she went in pilgrimage to
diverse places of devotion as well in the cuntrie of He^alt, as of Liege, and else
were, and yet could she obtain no ease. At last having heard of the miracles
of our Lady at Montaigu, she went thither upon her crutches about the
beginning of November in the year 1604, and being in our Ladies Chapel she
said her prayers there upon her* knees: afterward intending to go to the
priest* to confession that she might also communicate, suddenly as she arose
she felt in herself such an alteration, that she^ went to her Confessor
without any help of her crutches, and having ended her devotions she departed
only with the help of a staff, and left her crutches in the Chapel for a
perpetual memory of the benefit which she had there received, and so
returned home, where she remains increasing daily in her strength and force,
going at this present to the Church, and in her hows without any support what
soever: as appears by her deposition made under her oath before the Maier and
Escheuins of the court of the Lordship of Ligny, upon the seventh of Ianuarij
1605, subsigned I. D^c^s Secretary.

A cure of a sore leg.
NIcholas Crumm^^^ a young man born^ in Vaels hard by the City of Aken, as some
seven years since he served one Martin L^^a^s in a farm appertayning to the
Chanon^ of Aken where he was employed in tilling the ground and to look unto
certain horses, he ^elt on a day about Whitsontyde a kind of grief and
gnawing in his left leg, and afterward an issue broke out of the same leg, the
which increasing by little and little waxing as broad as the palm of ones hand,
it began to yield out a kind of yellow water and moisture, and it much hindered
him in his labor, and somtymes he was in that case that he could not go out of
the hows. Whereupon he transported himself to the said City of Aken there to
take the counsel and advise of a certain surgeon called Henry Pau^n, in whose
hows he remained about some three weeks for this purpose: but he profited him
nothing for all that he could apply unto him: and in steed of one issue there
ensued an other. Afterward he was cou^seled by some to go to the ha^gman of
the City, who had him in cure for the space of fifteen days, and yet (...)
was nothing helped by him. From th^^^ ^e caused himself to be carried to the
(...) of Maestright, where for the space of (...) months he put himself into
the hands of ^^e Barbers and Surgeons, and nam^ly of M. John Cornill^, James
H^^ain, and P^^^^ Cr^mmens: who all by diverse medicines and remedies endeavored
to cure him, but they achieved no more then the others before: his leg
remaning with the former soars, and was very much swollen, so that the patient
was forced to go with two crutches. And in this plight he remained for a long
time, being not able to go so much as one or two steps without his crutches.
Whereby being at last brought to that poverty that he was constrained to
procure his living by the alms of good folk, he was counseled by some to go
unto the great Hospital of Bruxelles there to be healed and assisted. Where
being admitted, he continued for some four months and an half, and albeit
that he was daily visited by M. John Bierens sworn Surgeon of the City, and
by the Religious women of the said hospital, yet they could never cure him.
Whereupon leaving Bruxelles, he went to Antwerp, where he was again in the
Hospital for fourteen weeks, and he was assisted and dressed by two Surgeons,
whereof the one was called M. Cornelius and the other M. John, and although
both they and the Physicians which visited and frequented him, had used all
their diligence to heal him, yet they profited nothing, so that all that they
did was in vain. In so much as being out of all hope to be cured, he departed
out of the Hospital, and went up and down a beggig going always with his
crutches. Afterward coming to the City of Maclin he put himself into the
Hospital to try if there he could be helped: where for the space of six weeks
he was in the hands of the surgeon of that Hospital, dwelling near to our
Ladies Church, who also spared no pains to cure him: but all was frutelesse,
and procured him no ease, the poor patient continuing still in the said state,
having his left leg drawn backward, and very crooked, and so stiff, that he
thought none was able by any force to make it right again. And so seeing all
the remedies that he applied there unto did no good, he remained still lame, not
meddling any more with physic or surgerie, save only that he took some
plasters now from one, and then from an other to preserve his leg from
rotting. It happened that in the beginning of the year 1603. he hard folk tell
of the miracles which were wrought at Montaigu through invocation of our Lady,
whereupon he went with his crutches thither from the aforesaid village of
Vaels, where he was at that present, and he continued for a certain time in the
mountain, there daily praying, and yet at that time he felt no ease at all.
But whereas afterward he perseuered in going often times in pilgrimage to the
said Montaigu, and in visiting our Ladies Chapel: at the last betwixt Easter
and Whit suntyde in the year 1604. seiourning for some time on the said
mountayn, and doing his accustomed devotions at the Chapel, he also took of
the water that is in the said place, and daily washed his leg therewith:
wherein he found incontinently amendment, and perceived that the two soars of
his leg (which were now turned into one and w^^ as large as both ones hands)
began to heal, and by little and little to decrease. Upon which eue^t being to
depart from thence, he furnished himself with a good quantity of that water in
a ^ot, wherewith he continued to wash his leg as before, and so by little and
little the said sore was made perfectly whole, and the swelling of his leg went
away. And in the beginning of December in thesayd year 1604. he came again to
Montaigu with his crutches (although he had already felt so great ease that he
used them not) and stayed there until the twentieth of the said month, daily
washing his leg in the order as before we have said: and at that time it became
very right, strong, and free from the former evil, insomuch that he left his
crutches at our Ladies Chapel, going and walking as perfectly as any other:
and from thence he went on foot without any pain or grief to the City of
Bruxelles upon the xxijth of the same month: where before the magistrates of

Laus Deo beataeque Virgini Dei Genitrici Mariae.
THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRANSLATOR.
Here, and with these (Christian Reader) I thought good for this present to
end, although Almighty God through his goodness of these miraculous works as
yet makes no end. The addition of those miracles which at our Montaigu this
last year have been wrought, after due examination are now under the printers
hands, whereof in time (by Gods help) I will make thee partaker. Mean while
with the devout Euangelical woman make thy profit of these which here thou
fyndest: and with her not only inclyne thy heart to believe, but also lift up
thy voice to profess and confess the happiness of this sacred Mother, at whose
intercession they are wrought, and withal the infall^ble assured authority of
the Catholic Apostolik and Roman Church, in which only, and for whose only
comfort, credit, and confirmation they are atchiued. Remember who they were
that would have killed Lazarus, and in deed killed our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ: whom therefore they should have believed and honored, when they saw by
his most doubtless signs the truth was so manifested and their impiety
detected. Beware thou turn not with them to the reason of state, and earthly
policy, saying: Neveniant Romani or such like, thereby diuerting thy self
from that which principally thou art bound to regard, least through the just
judgment of God, that which thou now most fear apprehend thee, and that
which should be thy sovereign object, hereafter fail thee. Do thou not see
how our Catholic doctrine by the same powerful hand at this present is vpholden
and fostered, by which at the beginning it was planted and took root? Read
read, and see Yet for thyn own good I am to increat thee, to avoid all
curiosity in thy reading, as thou see how I have avoided it in my
translation: endeavoring rather truly then trimly to express my Author, as he
has labored purely and punctually to deliver us the truth. Likewise be thou
careful, not curious in learning the truth, and Christia^ly courageous in
confessing the truth, that in the hour of thy chiefest peril the truth may
deliver thee.
