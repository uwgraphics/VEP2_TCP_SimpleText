AN EPITOME OF CRONICLES.

Conteyninge the whole discourse of the histories as well of this realm of
England as al other countries, with the succesion of their kings, the time of
their reign, and what notable acts they did: much profitable to be read,
namelye of Magistrates, and such as have auctoritee in commonweals, gathered
out of most probable auctours. First by Thomas Lanquet, from the beginning of
the world to the incarnacion of Christ, Secondely to the reign of our
sovereign lord king Edward the sixth by Thomas Cooper, and thirdly to the
reign of our sovereign Lady Queen Elizabeth, by Robert Crowley.

Anno. 1559.

LONDINI, In aedibus Thomae Marshe.

To the right high and mighty Prince, Edward by the grace of God, Duke of
Somerset, governor of the kings maiestees most royal person, and protector
of all his highness realms dominions, and subjects, Thomas Cooper wysheth
all wealth and perfect felicity.
AL be it (right excellent prince (your affabilltye and clemency is such,
and so great, that all people of every state and degree, as well poor as
rich, may at all conueniente times have free access to your grace, and have
their reasonable suites complayntes, and peticions benignely heard, and
according to equitee, justice and good conscience depeched, so that thereby it
is very likely that the true knowledge of the state and condition of the weal
public, is at all times to your grace reveled and opened: Yet because (well
nere) in all commonweals, and about all such noble and good princes, there
have been some, which for their own commoditee, advancement, displeasure or
other affection, have so let and hindered true report, that it could not
frankly come forth, it is a thing much to be feared, and with all wisdom
and prudence to be foresene, lest any such might perchance hereafter covertly
crepe in favor, as by flatterye and dissimulacion, would endeavor to abuse
your godly gentilnesse, as such have dooen the like natures of other most
virtuous and worthy governors before time: and by that means not only
blemyshe greatly the immortal praises that your grace should most woorthily
deserve of all men, for your godly and politic governance, but also turn
this noble realm to much trouble and hindrance. For never did there chance
greatter mischief to any comm^n weal, never were the virtuous natures of
great rulers so soon corrupted, as either when they have been misinstructed
and wrong infourmed by flatterers, or else when those that were in most favor
and credyte, dissimu^ing the truth, instead of equitee and justice, have
wrought their own purposes. Was not the good king Darius by wicked persuasio^s
induced, even against his conscience, to commit Daniel the prophet of god,
to the danger of the cruel and hungry lions? had not the devilish counsel
of Haman persuaded Assuerus without cause to destroy the whole nation of the
Jews, for malice that he bare to Mardocheus, ne had the singular prouydence of
God in Hester preserved them? to what misgouernaunce and vicious living did
Perennius, Cleander, and other bring the emperor Commodus, notwithstanding the
grave and sage counsailours left him by his father Marcus Antonius? did any
thing so much corrupt the nature of the valiant conqueroure Alexander, and so
greatly blemish his fame and glory, as that he had his ears so open to
flatterers? which made him to think, that he was the son of their great
god Jupiter? yea almost that he was a god and no mortal man. Wherefore the
wise emperor Gordian had good cause to say, that he was a wretched prince,
from whom v ertuous counsel and the truth of matters was hid by flatery.
Yea (and in mine opinion) it were far more tolerable, that the sovereign
were evil him self, then that his nere friends, servants, or famylyars,
whom he trusts, should be flatterers, covetous, or malisyous. For such
persons shall not only them selfs do much evil, but also by false
informacion, corruptinge the high ruler (if it be possible) allure him to do
the like, to the peril and danger both of him self and of the weal
public. Therefore wisemen have always judged them most worthy, to be
extremely punished, to the example of al other, like as the noble emperor
Alexander for his sharp justice named Seuerus, caused Vetronnis Thurinus with
smoke to be smuddered to death, because in matters of suite he had taken bribes
for false report of the emperors favor. For the noble governor suspecting
no such eueil to be in them, (for how long would it be, ere the wily ways of
such subtle re^nardes may be spyed out) may lightly be misledde and do the
more ^o he would not, if he wist surely how the truth went. And this danger
has always been so much the thing be feared, as that witty men perceyuyng
things to be in suchewise mishandled by them that were in great favor with
their princes, durst not, or at the least would not speak and discover the
grievous hurtes of the commen weal: some, for fear to be hindered by those
familiars, and so to lose their dignitees, offices, and auctoritees: some for
great hope that they had, to be by their report commended, and thereby
advanced to some promocion or high room in the common weal. So that I gather
hereby (right excellent prince) that of all other it is a thing most
difficile and hard to rule well, and for a chief magistrate and governor to
be truly and without dissimulacion informed in every case, as the notable
saying of king Antiochus, does well declare: who on a time of hunting, being
strayed from his company and benighted, was feign to take for his harborowe, a
poor cotage of the country, and there, as he was unknown at supper with the
vplandishe people, through communication, heard diverse things frelye talked of
his own behauour Therefore on the morrow, when his ministers brought to him his
purpre raiment and diadem, he tourning to those ensigns said. Sins the time
I first began to were you, yesterday only and never before I herd the truth
frankly spoken. Wherefore the best and most sure way for a noble governor,
after the counsel of the excellent philosopher Demetrius, is to read such
books, as most wittily and pithilye treat of the states of commonweals, and
namely histories in the which he shall playnelye see set forth before his
eyes what best beseems him to do, what to eschew: what may advance the
state of his common weal, what may hurt and hinder the same: how and by
what means hatred and grudge is bredde toward him, and how and by what ways
he may win love and favor: What makes his realm weak, what makes it
strong: What makes it wealthye and rich, what makes it poor and beggarly:
what makes it floryshe many years* what makes it miserable in short space: in
books shall he learn to know the wily flattering foxes, from his sure and
trustye friends: good and faithful ministers, from false feigning
dissemblers: Whom and how he ought to chose his counsaylours, how and what
laws he ought to make. Thus (I say) he shall learn out of books to be him
self to him self, the best the trustest and surest counsaylour. And for this
consyderacion would I wish, that the sums of all such learned works, were
drawn out into short brigementes, to the end that prudent governors (which
for their manyfolde affairs and businesses, have but small time of leisure)
might in liew of other plays, pass the time therwyth, like as the Epitome or
brigemente of chronicles is, which not many years passed was begun by a
studious young man named Thomas Lanquet, and now of late by me finished* and
continued, from the incarnacion of Christ, to the second year of the reign of
our sovereign lord king Edward the sixth. In ^^che form and order that a
diligent reader may as in a mirror behold the state and condition of all
realms at all times, and know what governors ruled them, how many years they
reigned, and what notable acts were done in the time of their reign, when the
Britains, and likewise the Scotts, came first into this land, with the
succession of their kings, and the whole discourse of the historyes of both
countries: so that ye may perceive, what notable act was done in any realm
under every king of England, and what year of his reign. For the years of the
kings of this land be noted in the margent, with the year of the world and of
Christ. In the computacyon we have followed the most sure account of the
bible and Hebrews, which dyffereth much from Eusebius and other latin
Croniclers. These my labors (such as they be) most excellent prince, I
thought most convenient to publish in your Graces name, not for the well
handling of the same, nor yet because I judged it worthy so noble a Prince:
but only as I did of late exhibit the correction of sir Thomas Eliotes
Dictionarie to the kings most royal maiestee, to testify my loving and
obedient heart toward his highness, so do I now offer this simple gift to
your Grace, as a witness or testimony of the good zeal and love, which all
men ought (as well as I) to bear toward you, for your christian and virtuous
governance, and especially for your godly zeal in aduancyng the true religion
of christ: wishing continually with most hertie prayer, that you governing us
so benignely, so mercifully, so godly, might always live in most happy
felicitee, and bring this diuersitee of opinions to a perfect vnite^ and
concord in Christ's doctrine, that we with mutual love and charitee, and
hertye obedience toward our prince, may give condign honor and worship unto
god, and immortal praises to your name. Amen.

FINIS.
Thus ends the table made for the spedie findyng out of any name or other
thing that ye would seek for. in this Epitome of Cronicles, by the number of
the leaf, and in as many places we^^er^, as any man is spoken of: is the
intent that ye should not spend much time in serchyng out it that you desire
to know.
Of the use and profit of historyes, and with what judgment they ought to
be read.
ALBEIT FOR MANY CAUSES (which we shall hereafter recyte) the readyng of
hystoryes does indifferently avail all men, yet most specyallye it perteyneth
to kings and greatte princes, whose book it may be worthily called, because
that the knowledge thereof is most profitable and necessary to all those,
which have the governance of common weals. For not only the hystoryes of
the Gentiles, but also of the holy scryptures, do in every place make mencyon
of them. The holy scryptures, besides that they make us certain of the will
and word of God, and also of the spyrytuall kyngedome of Christ, teach us
polyticall administracion, and set forth many notable examples, which in
rulynge a publyke weal be necessary to be known, and whereby the minds of
princes may be styerred to the study of true nobilitye and virtue. The
hystoryes of the Gentyles declare the orygynall and beginning of great
empyres, and for what causes there has chanced in them so great and so
straung alterations and grievous commocyons. In the same is also contained
precepts of offices and virtues, whereby the commonweals may most
prosperousely be preserved, continued and advanced. And for this cause
hystoryes are most worthy to be called the books of good princis and noble
men. Now, forasmuch as unto every prince there belongs a double virtue,
that is, a political or external, and a faith and fear toward god,
Exaumples of them both be showed to us out of hystoryes. Therefore we will
first speak of ciuyle virtues. Princes, yea and all other, that have
auctorytye in great affairs and high matters, ought those examples and
acts chyefelye to consider, whereby they may be admonyshed, by what means
they may most prosperouslye exercise them selfs in the governance of the
weal public. They must set before their eyes the examples of good kings
and rulers, and of them must they learn the necessary duty and the vpryght
trade of governing their empyers, that in their reigns, besides the utility
and benefyte of the publyke weal, they regarded nothing* that justice and
equity they only enbraced, that all misdemeanors and offenses they grievously
punished: and again, that toward good men and pecible they were always
beneficial and gentyl, that for every cause they would not raise up wars,
but by wynkinge at iniuryes, reteyne peace, and yet in defense of their
royalmes, were never the less of an invincible courage and redye will: finally
that by their wisdom, power, and strength, that defended their dominions from
all outward hostilitye, and the same in true religyon, wealth, quietness, and in
all necessary arts made to flouryshe. In all which qualities our most
excellent and gracious prince Henrye the eyghte, has excelled, and is an
example to them all which shall succeed. For in him alone is coniested and
heaped all the sundry good qualities of the ancient kings, by which they
opteyned so great renome. Which qualityes he has so practysed in the
governance of his realm, That I suppose there never was in any common weal,
any noble prince and gouernoure which has declared mo examples of wisdom,
or showed mo benefits and pleasures to his country than his grace has. But
to the purpose. For the contrary part.

In the examples of tyrannes they may observe diverse things: as, The end of
them to be miserable* and that through their cruelty many mischefes and
dangerous co^mocions have chanced in their commonweals As it appears how
Pharao for tyrany peryshed, and for like cause the Romain kings were exiled.
Princes have oftentimes distroyed one the other, only for pride, disdain and
envy, and that many times begun upon nothing. Even as it was the only cause of
the cruel wars between Caesar and Pompei. The Romayne hystoryes show, that the
desire of novelty has often been the stirer of most grievous wars. And the
sect and reygne of Machomet had none other beginning but of heresy and
dissencion of the artycles of the faith. It avails them much that be in
auctoritye, to mark these things in the redynge of hystoryes* that they learn
to beware, foresee, and avoid like things in their governance. For the same
chances daily happen, all be it the persons now and than be changed in the
commonweals, ne uerthelesse as pertaining to the similitude of busynes and
trouble, the world remains the world, and like unto it self. Therefore most
truly Thucydides (who was a man excellent in the knowledge of warrefare, and
also wrate the greatte and long war, and other sundry thyges, which
chanced among the Greeks) says, Hystoryes be a treasure, which ought never to
be out of our hands, that thereby being aided, we may the more commodiously
handle such business and like chances in the commune weal, for as much as
the causes often times chance almost like.

Furthermore there be axaumples found in hystoryes, convenient for every man
privately in his degree, as magistrates ought to be obeyede, and that they
never escaped unpunished, which have rebelled against them, even as Dathan,
Absalom, Catiline, Brutus, Cassus, and such like for their sedicion have been
worthily punished. Of the fidelity of friends, as Ionathas saved the life of
king Dauyd. Of the punishment for homicide, adulterye, and such like
offenses, as it appears by the example of David. But what shall need many
words. Even as in every art paternes be given to follow: likewise in
hystoryes be peinted before our eyes examples of all kinds of virtues. But yet
in examples and deeds it is more euydently perceived, what the dignytye of
virtue, and again, what the bacenesse of dyshonestee and vices be, than in
bare precepts, because that examples, set as images before us, do not only
openly teach, but also both warn and stir our minds, so that thereby with
a certain delight and desire they be kyndled toward virtue and honesty. For
who in heart can be so stubborn and hard, that will not be moved, if he read
any thing notable, that is either worthy praise, or else examples utterly to
be abhorryd

I have showed briefly how in readyng of hystoryes examples of political
virtues and ciuyle affairs ought to be observed, Now it perteyneth to a true
christen man. (who above all things ought to esteem godliness, to know,
that he may gather also out of hysteryes, examples of faith and fear of god:
For these be the special virtues of good men, which in the syghte of god be
most auailable. Al be it that the hystoryes of the gentyles do not teach,
that god cares or has ought to do with us: yet a godly mind nevertheless
shall consider, that the publyke weals in the world be conserved by the power
of god, and that is the work of god to punyshe and revenge all oppressyon, and
vyolence, ye and that unto the heathen God gives excellent qualities. For
princes can not preserve their empyers against the assaults of Satan, without
the syngular benefyt of god, and the aid of their own virtue and wisdom.
And so by this manner a good man may well suppose, that these acts and
punishments be the w^rkes of god, and thereby may lern the fear of god. As
that tyrannes have been greuousely punyshed according to this sentence: He
that takes the sword, that is, which without auctorytye usurps the right
of reuengyng, he shall peryshe by the sword. Contrarywyse, it is euydent, that
good princes be preserved and defended by god, and that also the Ethnykes did
well perceive, in that their princes had great affiaunce in the help of their
gods. For Homere the poet says: God casts his sh^elde in the battle, to
defend the princes, He feigneth also every prince to be under the protectyon
of his god, as it appears by the goddess Pallas, which alw^yes was present
with Achilles. But this thing is more plainly expressed in the hystoryes of
the holy scripture, as in Noe, Abraham, Moses, Dauyd, Ezechias, and the other
princes and kings, whom god always preserved. And their examples be set
before the eyes of all other princes, that they may certainly know, that in
like manner god will defend all good kings. For this difference is between the
holy and profane hystoryes, that in them be showed the testymonies of the
works of god, and the which do not only entreat of cyuile matters, but
chiefly do represente unto us the kingdom of god, that god gives his word,
that of his mercy he will save us, where in the hystoryes of the gentiles be
ignorant. Therefore principally the hystoryes of the holy scripture ought to be
known to all christen men, that thereby they may learn the doctrine and
stablishement of faith.

First how all things were created of god, what was the original of sin,
that against sin Christ instituted his kingdom, gave his word, and that
he should come to take away sin, and save us. Also how god, wha^ he had
given his word, preserved always the reygne of Christ, and that the reign of
Christ, that is, the true beleuers from the beginning of the world, walked
under the cross, and nevertheless were pre served. That Satan with all the
power of the world assaulted the word of god. Moreover, that God meruaylously
performed his promise above the opinyon and capacity of man's wit. Also that
examples both of horyble vengeance, and also of grace and forgyuenes be showed
to us of God, So unto king David and other chanced remission of syns, that by
their examples we might be comforted and believe, that god will forgive.
Neither this is to be neglected that for the confyrmacion of our minds, God
has given us all sorts of prophecies of external kingdoms, that by the
fulfillying of them, we may have a testimony that our word is of god,
neither that any other faith than ours, is true. And that we may be
admonyshed by them, when Christ ought to come, and when the consummacion of the
world shall be. Finally, for the right understanding the prophecyes, it shall
be very expedyent to know the success and alteracion of the monarchies and
kingdoms, with the computacyon and noumber of the years, which be in the
hystoryes of the Gentiles exactly set foorth^^ the knowledge whereof, even for
this cause is necessary for chrystians, that they may the better understand
the prophecyes, and of th^y^ the more certaynely judge. Certes every man may
by these things esteem, what pleasure and profit is gathered in reading of
hystoryes, and the fruitful commoditye thereof ought worthily to stire and
compel every man to know them.

Of the origynall beginning of man, after the false opynion of the Ethnike
philosophier.
THe phisosophyer of ancient time (who without knowledge of the very true
godhead, many hundred years gone, have set out historyes in writynge) were
of diverse opynions, concerning the original beginning of man. Forsome of them
believed the world to have been a thing uncreated, that is to say, without
beginning: and incorruptible, that is, never to have end: and likewise
mankind to have been of eternal continuance. Other some of them were of
opynion, that the world was created and corruptyble, and avouched, that man
took the beginning of generation by succession of time. For their imagynacion
was, that at the first beginning of things* both the sky and the earth bad
one sole sourme and shape, the nature of the one with the other intermingled,
and in process, the same bodies disseuered, the universal world to have
received this order which we se at this present. And first the air to have
found the same continual mouynge, and the fyry part thereof, by reason of
lyghtnesse, to have mounted to the highest places, the Son, and other
sterres, of the same cause to have gotten their courses, and what was myngled
with moisture, stylle to have remained in the first place, by reason it was
heavy, and could not rise, which inferior things, being mixed or heaped
together by commixtion, the sea to have been produced of the moist or lyquyde
things, and of the harder stuff or matter* the earth in conclusion to have
remained clammy and nesh. When this earth, at the first beginning, was
through the feruente heat of the son settled and grown to a thycker and
more massy substance, than the vppermoste parts of the same within a short
space, by the power of the heat swelled into littel bunches, and certain
humors in many sundry places gathered and congeled together by it self, in
which humors did arise certain corrupcyons of rottennes, covered througheout
with a little thynne scumme or cream, like as it chances in the marshes of
Egypt, and in dead standing pooles, when the feruente heat of the air
does sodeynely parche the cold earth, than when the heat commethe to
moist things, anon is wroughte generatyon, by reasone that in the night
time, the air round about enuyronneth it with humor, which in the day is
by the virtue of the soonne made hard. After certain space of time, the said
putryfactyons being brought to their vttermooste extente (approchynge as it
were the time of delyuerance) as soon as the said scummes or crea^es were
thoroughly dried and broken, they brought forth the shapes of all kinds of
living things Whereof such as had by chance received more heat, being
made apt to flight^* ^unted up in to the air: such as had remaining in them
more of the earth, becam, some of them crepers on the ground, and some of them
other beasts of the earth, such as happened to have a watryshe nature, were
carried into the element of their proper kind, and were named fyshes. Than the
earth after this, partly with the parchynge heat of the son, and partlye
with the wyndes warynge still drier and dryer, surcessed bryngyng forth
beasts of any great quantitye, but those that were alredye engendered, brought
forth others, each of his own kind, through mutual co^mirtion and
engendrynge one with an other. And in the very self same wise, they say, that
man also was at the first beginning produced, and that he, seekinge his food
in the wild fields, long time lived a saluage and rude life, as unto whom
only the fruicte of the grass and of the tryes did of it self myn^ster
sustynaunce. They sayen furthermore, that the other wild beasts were noyefull
unto men, which beasts to withstand, they assembled them in companyes and
for fear of the said beasts, for a common vtilytie, and that mutual aid
and succur might be ministered by one to an other, they sought out places
where to inhabit. And where the sown of their mouth was such as might not be
understand, they made a distinction of one word from an other by littell and
lyttel, and called each thing by a several name. Albeit for as much as they
were placed in sundry corners or regions of the world, they used not all no
manner words or speech: and therefore there was (say those philosophers)
sundry fourmes and facyons of letters. And the companiss of men first
essembled, they report, to have been the first progenitors, every company of
his own nation, but the first men, having no manner stay of help or
succoure, lived an hard life, because they had no knowledge nor provision to
save and lay up the fruytes of the fyeldes to occupye afterward in time of
need. And hereof it chanced, that in the winter season veraye many, either by
famyne, or else by reason of cold peryshed. In process of time, being well
taught by experyence, they both sought out caves to lie in, for aduoydyng and
defendyng the extreme sharpness of co^de, and also began to keep fruits in
store. After this (...) knowlage of fire, and of other things for man's use
necessary perceived and learned, the other commodityes of man's life were in
short space found out. Finally necessitye being made the schol^ maystres of
things, ministered unto the wits of every singular person, cunnyng and
expert practisyng: and unto them were also given to adiutours to help them,
hands, speech or communicacion, and excellency of mind. And those
phylosophiers, which were thoroughly persuaded, that this was the orygynall
beginning of man, and did not refer the same to the pro^ydence of god,
avouched, that the Ethiopes were the first men of all that ever were, following
this conjecture, that the soil of Ethiopia began before all other part es of
the earth to increase in warmethe, by reason that the son is nerest to it,
where as the earth was of it self all da^kyshe and moist, whereby it happened,
that of the same first proporcion attempring of moisture and heat, man was
engendered, and that the same man after his pr^cr^^cyon, did with better will
and apytyte hold him self in that part of the earth, where it happened him to
be procreate, than to seek any other, for as much as all things were unto him
as yet vnoknwen.

Other there be, which suppose the Scithians to be the first people of the
world, and that between them and the Egyptians was long contencion, whether
nation was of more antiquytie. The Egyptians all^dgynge for them that in the
beginning of all things, when that some contraryes by the feruente heat of
the son were ^u^n parched and burned, other again by extreme cold were
frosen, so that it could not ingend^r men, nor yet receive nor sustain
inhabitauntes, before that garments were invented to save the body from the
violence of cold and heat, and ill places by remedy mollified: Aegypte
always to have been so temperate, that neither the winter cold, nor the somer
heat might grieve her inhabitants, the ground being moreover so fruitful,
that there is no land so fertile of nouryshmentes for man's use. Therefore by
reason it seems, that there men should first engender, where they might most
easily be nouryshed.

On the other part, the Scithyans supposed the temperatenes of the air to be
no argument of antiquitee. For nature, when she divided cold and heat into
regyons, forthwith engendered creatures apt to suffer the qualityes of the
places, yea and trees, fruytes, and herbs according to the disposicyon of the
regyons. And how much more sharper the air is to the Scithians, than to the
Aegypcians, so much the harder be they of body and wit. Moreover, if the
world, which now is divided into elements, has been confused all in one,
either the water in the beginning sourroundyng al things, or else the fire,
which also engendered the world, possessynge it, the Scithians in the original
of both begynnynges were the more anciente. For if the fire first possessed
all things, which by little and little quenched, gave place to the earth,
there was no place so soon disseuered from the fire, by the cold of winter,
as the north, in so much as now there is no land so vehement cold. Egypt,
and all the east was very long, ere they were temperate, because that now they
be even seared with the fervent heat of the son, Or if all the earth at the
first was covered with waters, certes the highest parts, the waters
assuagynge, were first discovered, and in the lowest grounds did longest
abide, and the sooner that every part of the earth was dry, so much the
sooner began it to bring forth living creatures. But Sc^thia is so high
over all other countries, that all waters seem there to spring and fall into
the great mere Meotis, from whence it runs into the seas of Pontus and
Egypt. Which Egypt (of long time has been defended with the cares and charges
of so many kings, fortified with so great banks against the violence of
watres, trenched out with so many dyches, that where the water is kept out in
one place, it may be received in another, could not be inhabited, unless
Nilus were held out) can not seem to be of any antitiquitie, but rather
appears to be a la^e country, either by the heapynges of kings, or else by
the casting up of the mudde of Nilus.

By these arguments the Egyptians being overcome, the Scithya is always have been reputed the more ancient people among the Gentyles. But now I will leave
to write of the vain fantasye of the Ethnykes, which I have here set
forth, to the intent, that the reders may perceive the blind iudgmente of
them, which without the knowledge of god and his scryptures, would define
the origynall of man. And here consequentlye I will begin my first book,
with the creation of man, according as it is set forth in the holy
scryptures, the aucthoritee and certayntee whereof is most sure: which I will
continue until the time of Abraham: during which time the world stood
without prescript administracion or certain law, but only was led by the
law of nature. For in this hystorye I shall use this order, and shall divide
my book into three ages, of the which the first shall conteyne those things
that were done between the time of Adam and Abraham: the second from Abraham
unto the coming of Christ, and the third from the incarnacion of Christ unto
this present time.

The first part of Lanquettes Chronicle.
THE holy scryptures do show, that when the heaven, the earth, and all the
furnytures thereof were created, on the syxte day Adam, the most excellent
of all creatures, was by God almighty made of the slyme of the earth, who
breathed into him the breathe of life, and the soul, whereby he was made like
unto the image of god.

Unto this most perfect man, god gave such grace, that without any
instructions, but only with the indowmentes of his origynall ryghtuousnes, he
was foorthewyth perfectly seen and learned in all the lyberall arts: He was
inspired also with the knowledge of the natures of all herbs, trees,
mettalles, stones, birds, beasts, fysshes, worms, and all other creatures.
Moreover, unto him God gave power over all things, that were on the earth,
and in the sea, so that unto all beasts, fowls, fyshes, and worms, Adam did
give a propre and a convenient name, according to the natures of them, even as
they be called at this day. Than was he brought by the almighty lord into
the pleasant place of Paradyse, replenyshed with all pleasure. The felicitye
of which place S. Augustine does in this wise descryue: Man lived in
Paradyse as he would, how long he willed that which God commanded, he lived
having the fruicyon of god by which goodness he was good: he lived without
any necessity, being in his power so always to have lived. Meat was ready,
that he should not hunger: drink, that he would not thyrst: the wood of life,
that age should not dyssolue him. In his flesh was perfect health, in his
mind no less tranquillytie. As in Paradyse is neither heat, ne cold, so in
his inhabitants is no offense of good will, nothing at all sorrowful, nothing
vainly glad. The true joy was continued by God, toward whom out of a pure
heart issued charity, concord of mind, watching of the body, and without
any labor, the custody of the commandment. There he might ocupye him
self, not for any necessity, but only for recreacion. Where he received
(...), that of all the trees in Paradyse he (...) eat, so that he absteined
from the tree of the knowlage of good and evil. The God perceiving that as yet
there was no creature made like unto a man, which might be an helper and
companion unto him, he forth with cast Adam into a slumber, and took a ryb out
of his side, fyllyng the place with flesh, whereof he made the woman, and
brought her unto him, whom when Adam saw, he said. This is now bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh, she shall be called woman, because she is taken
out of the man, vvher fore man shall forsake his father and mother, and shall
clean unto his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh. The lord blessed
the m and said. Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it* and
be ye lord over the fyshes in the sea, the fowls of the air, and all beasts
that move on the earth. But man, when he was in this high felicitye, could not
perceive it, for thorough the craft of the envious serpent (which a little
before for his outrageous pride was driven out of heaven) and the prouocatyon
of the woman, he transgressed the commandment given to him by god, wherefore
they were driven out of paradyse, and made subject to death sin, and all
kinds of misery, for the earth was restreygned, that it should no more bring
forth fruits of it self, but by sweat and paynfull labors they should lead
their lives. Than came syckenesse upon them, and heat and could began to
assail their tender bodies. For when they began to sin, god did open the
power of Satan, and against him, of the seed of the woman, he promised that
Christ should come and destroy the power of Satan, and deliver us free from
death and sin. This was the first declaracion of the gospel, which began
the kingdom of Christ and the Church. And so Adam and Eua took comfort of
the promise of Christ, and of these two persons the church began.

After that they were thus exiled out of paradyse, the holy scriptures do
testifye, that they brought forth children, and that Cayn was their first
begotten, and after many other, Abell. These two brethren were the founders of
two contrary cities, Babell and Jerusalem: by the one is understand
confusyon, and by the other the vysion of peace. Their father taught them to
fear god, and worship him with sacryfyces, Cayne was of an unhappy
dysposicion, given unto all vices, and was the first that tylled the earth he
offered always the most vile things unto god. Abell the younger, was of
contrary condycions: he gave him self to virtue, and in all things that he
went about, he thought god to be present, his occupacion was in keeping of
beasts, and gave unto god the best of all things. For in their sacryfices his
offryng, with fire descendyng from heaven, was forthwith consumed, but his
brothers remained untouched. Wherefore Cayn (perceiving that his brother was of
God preferred before him) with malice, and disdeine thereat stirred, slew him.

In this hystorye is declared the anger and furye of the devil, and also the
infirmitye and weakness of man, besides the grievous and ernest sentences of the
judgment of God, and of the terrible vengeance of god for the effusyon of
blood, which were to long to recite in this place. After that Cayne, the
first murderer, fled from his father, he builded the first city in the
orient, and named it Enoch, after the name of his first son. His children
invented al kinds of crafts and sciences. Finally he was punyshed for the
murder that he committed, and perysshed by such a kind of death.

Iuball, the son of Lamech by Ada his wife, first made the portatyne tents,
for to feed his cattle, and ordered his flocks, disseuerynge the sheep from
the gotes, and found out the certain time when the rams should be put to
the ewes, and taught it other.

Tuball, his brother, a man of singular wit, invented the science of musyke,
by the strokes and noise of the hammers of his brother Tubalcayn, which was a
smyth. For delyting in the sound of the hammers, by the weight of them, he
perceived the proporcyons and tunes, that the hammers gave, and thereby devised
the pryncyples of music.

Tubalcayn their brother, and son of Lamech by his other wife Sela, first
invented the finding out of metal, and the workyng thereof.

Noema also found out the use of wolle, with the cardyng, spynnyng, and
weauynge thereof.

After the death of Abell, and exile of Cayn, Adam, wha^ he was an. C.xxx.
years of age,

Seth, in the.105. year of his life, begat Enos. He began to call upon the
name of the lord. the begynnng of Adam was no generation, but a formacyon:
Nevertheless the plasmacion of Adam is reckned among the generacions, where he
is accounted in the first. Seth in the second, and so consequently, which
manner is more used.

In the, 70. year of his life, Caynan begat Malalehell,

Malalehell, in the.lxv. year of his life, begat Iared.

Iared, in the.262. year of his age, begat Enoche. There were two Enoches, one
the first son of Cayn, the later does appear in that it is written, that he
has walked with god, and that he has prophesied of the times to come.



Eathusalem in the.187. year of his life begatte Lamech,

Adam our first father deceaced, when he was.930. year of age.

Enoch in this season was by god taken up into heaven* which deed does
manifest unto us the immortalitye that remains after this life,



Noe, when he was.500. years of age, begatte Sem, Cham, when that men began to
multiplye upon the earth, and brought forth daughters, the children of god,
seeing the daughters of men to be fair, took them to their wives. The holy
scripture calls the children of god, all those which descended from Seth,
and the children of men those, which issued from Cain. For Adam commanded,
that the children of Seth should in no wise couple with the children of Cain:
which long time was observed, till that the zele and love of virtue decayed.
God thereby perceyuyng, that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth,
repented that he had made man, not that there is any such passion in god, but
that the scripture so speaks to us after a familiar and worldly manner: and
therefore thretned a destruction to the world by a floudde, and would therefore
Noe to declare this.120. years before it should come. In the mean time he
commanded him, that he should build an arc, that should conteyne in
length.300. cubits, which after the exposicion of Hugo and S. Augustine,
were.300. perches, every cubite geometrical being six common cubits: in
wideness it was.l. perches, and in depenesse, from the upper deck to the
bottom.xxx. perches, and the roufe over it in height one perch. This arc was
not by man's power brought into the sea, but by the course of the waters,
rysynge up, it was borne away, and rather by the divine providence, than by
man's policy, it was governed from renuynge to wrecke. Noe began to build this
in the.523. year of his life, before the flood, as Berosus witnesses, 78.
years. In the.vi.C. year, the second month, the lord said unto Noe, that
after seven days this deluge should fall, in which space he brought into the
arc, his stuff, provision, and al other things necessary for him. Whereat
every man laughed, and took him as one mad, that dreamed of such a flood.
But finally (as it is written in the gospel) they were eating and drynkyng,
they married and were married, even unto the day that Noe entered the arc, and
would not know it until the deluge came, and destroyed them all. Not that it
was unknown unto them but that they despised to believe it. For Noe showed it
to them as well in word as in deed. Also the buyldyng of the arc was a
certain declaracion thereof, but they were without faith and fear of God, for
which cause they were worthily punished. Thus the time passing, the.17. day
of the second month. Noe with his wife, and three sons, and their wives
entered the arc. And behold, sodeinly there came together unto him bestes of
al kinds, not brought thither by man, but even by the miracle of god. Neither
did Noe take them, but suffered them as they came to enter, ne there came
any more than of unclean beasts two, a male and a female, of clean bestes
seven, four males and three females, of the which one male was reserved for
sacrifice after the flood, the resydue were kept for generation.



Berosus the Caldei makes mention of this floude in this manner: Before the
famous deluge of waters, whereby the hole world perished, there preceded many
years, which of our Caldians were faithfully observed. They write, that about
Libanum was a great city of giantes called Enoch, who were lords of the world
from the rising of the son till the son set. They trustinge in the hugenes
and strength of their bodies, with armure that they had invented, oppressed all
men. They devised tences, musical instruments, and all delycacyes: they fed
with man's flesh, and companied commonly with their mothers, daughters,
sisters, men, and beasts: there was no wickedness, which they omitted. Then
many prophesied and preached, that a destruction should come, which they did
write in stones, but they scorned al things: There was one of these giantes,
wiser then all the other in Siria, whose name was Noa: he with his three sons
Samo, Iapeto, Chem, and their wives Titea, Pandora, Noela, and Noegla, fearinge
this destruction, which he perceived by the stars, began to make a ship in
facio^ of an arc.78. years before the flood. In the same year that the ship
was finished, sodeinli the occean swelled, and all the seas, flouddes, and
sprynges, rose above the mountains, with continual rain that fell from the
heavens, whereby all mankind perished, except Noa with his family, who were
saved in the ship, which the waters bore up to the tops of the mountayn
Cordie^, wherein my time remained part thereof. These be the words of Berosus,
who with his Caldeans are deceived in this, that they think Noe to forese the
flood by the stars, and not by the divine reuelacion.

When Noe had continued a year in the arc* the waters being assuaged, and the
earth dried, god commanded him to come forth, unto whom incontinent he builded
an aultare, and offered of beasts and birds a dylectable sacrifice. Then god
instituted as it were a new world again. First of al, he gave his word, by
the which he promised, that he would no more destroy the world with water:
and for the confyrmacion thereof, he gave the rain bow for a sure token
between him and man. For in that bow is expressed both the colors of water
and fire, the one part being blewe, the other red, that it might be a witness
of both the Judgments, the one past, the other to come: Also he granted
libertee to eat flesh, which the holy fathers before the flood never used.
Moreover, god gave a new precepte for the administracion of external things,
and commanded more plainly, that whosoever shed man's blood, his blood
should be spilte again of them, to whom it was lawfully committed, that is by
the magistrates and rulers, for man is made to the similitude of god. This Noe
faithful unto god, and an other father unto mankind, having in the space
of.100. years his issue wonderfully increased, being also thoroughly learned in
the knowlage of divine and humayne things, in the reuolucion of times, in the
histories of the world passed, but most specially in justice and relygion,
divided the world into three parts, which he him self in the residue of his
life peragrated, leaving in all places perpetual monumentes both of his
virtue, and also of his empire. He invented also the use of wine, with which
he was made drunk, so that he lay unhonestly discovered. Who being seen of
Cham, the father of Canaan, was of him scorned, and in derision brought his
two brethren to behold this sight: but they, moved with shamefastness and
honestee, covered their fathers members, and would not see them. The which
when Noe perceived, he blessed them, but Cham he would not curse, because the
lord blessed him: therefore he cursed Chanaan his nephewe, the son of Cham:
who, as some suppose, derided also his graundfather. He lived after the
flood.350. year, and for his sundry benefittes, showed unto all nations, they
gave unto him diverse names: among the which these as the most famous, be
celebrated: Noe, Ogyges, Fenix, Uranos, Coelus, Sol, Protheus, Ianus, Geminus,
Iunonius, Quirinus, Patulcius, Bacchus, Uortumnus, Chaos, Ileton. Seed of the
world, and father of al gods, and princis. The Italians, after his disceasse
dedicated to him, by the name of Uortumnus, a temple, and worshipped him with
divine honors and ceremonies. And also his wife Uesta, for her great prudence
and benefits, o bteyned these names: Earth, Opis, Aretia, Uesta, Cybeles, the
great mother of the goddis, who taught the maidens to keep the holy fire,
whereof arose the error and ceremonies of the virgins Uestales. The residue
of their acts shall be declared in order, as they were dooen. After the
universal flood, the world by the children of Noe, was shortly replenished
with people. For god, or nature, never yet failed the necessitee of things. Of
them there arose many famous and mighty nations.

Sem, the prince of Asia, called also Melchisedeth, a just and peacible king,
and priest of almighty god, from whom Christ liueally descended, possessed all
Asia with his children. For of Elam came first the Persians: of Assure the
Assyrians: of Arphaxat the Chaldeans: and of Aram the Syrians.

Cham, the second son of Noe, prince of Aphrike, called also Innuus,
Iucubus, Syluanus, Pana, Saturn of Egypt, the raiser and spreader of the
wickedness punished with the floude, inhabited the southe part of the world,
with his familye. Of Canaan, came the Cananees, of Phuth the Libyans, of
Mezraim the Egyptians, of Chus the Aethiopians, and of Saba the Arabians.

Iaphet, prince of Europa, called also Iapetus Priscus, Dyris, Maurus, Athlas,
received of his father Noe, for his portion, all the countries of Europe,
from the Gades, called at this time the streictes of Marrock, unto the great
river Tanais. Of him came these princis and nations: Comerus Gallus, who first
reigned in Italy: Magog, of whom came the Scithians, and of them the Turks:
Madaus, of whom sprange the Medes: of Iauan the Grecians, which were called
Jones: of Tuball the Spaniardes: of Mosoch the Moscouites: and of Tyras the
Thracians. I have briefly declared, what part of the world every of the
sons of Noe inhabited, which to the understanding of many histories shall
beenecessary.

Sem, the son of Noe,

Arphaxat, when he was.xxxv. years of aege,

Sale, in the.xxx. year of his life, begat Heber,

Heber, in the.34. year of his life,

Phalech, when he was.xxx. year of age, begat Reu, and lived after.209.
years. The first year of the life of Reu was the first year of the reign
of Nemroth in Babylon,

After the flood, mankind being increased, the city and tower of Babylon
began to be builded among the Chaldeis.

After this varietee of tungues chanced, diverse kinds of monstrous people
were brought forth in sundry places S. Augustine in his book entitled ye
city of god, writes in this manner: God knowing in what similitude or
diuersitiee of the members of man's body, the beaultie thereof is comprehended,
would also bring into the world many monstrous people, that thereby the pride
of man might be abated. Therefore what so ever manner men be borne in any place,
so that they be creatures reasonable, mortal, and begotten of man, ought not to
be doubted, albeit they be deformed, and contrary to our nature.

The first Monarchy.
IT is to be understand, that those things, which be done of magistrates and
rulers, ought to be taken and honored as the work of god. We have warned
before i^ our preface, that god would the world to be governed by.iiii.
monarchies, ye policy, justice, and correction might be kept among me^:
therefore many things be spoken of them in scripture. God did set forth these
monarchies or empires to Daniel by two facions. The first under the similitude
of a man, whose head was of gold, his breast of silver, his bealy of brass,
his legs of iron, his fete, part of iron, part of earth: and how christ
the stone brake the feet, that the man should fall, and so the world to end.
Daniel interpreted this vision to signify the.iiii. monarchies. For (says he)
the golden head signifies the first monarchy, which was of the Assyrians: the
silver breast, the kingdom of the Persia^s: the brazen bealy, the reygne of
the Macedons: the iron legs, the empire of the Romans: the earthen and iron
feet, do betoke^ this present state of the empire of Rome, because that at
this season it is of less power and reputacion than it has been.

The four beasts that were showed unto Daniel, signified the figure of these
monarchs. The Lion declared the strength of the Assyryans: the bear the power
of the Persians: the leopard the valyant courage of Alexander: the fourth beast
the puissaunce of the Romans.

There is more over, that other cruel kingdoms should rise, which should
ordeine hard and straight laws against the religion of Christ: by whom is
understand the reygne of Mahomettes and Turks at thse days. So faithfully
God remembers us, that the histories of the world known, we may consider the
end thereof to be at hand, and that by this means we may establishe our faith.

It appears in the Bible that the first kingdom was begun by Nemroth among
the Babylonia^s, whom the scripture calls a strong hunter before the lord,
that is a mighty prince, who by force brought people to his subjection. In
that he was called a hunter, is signified, that he was a deceiuer of souls, an
oppresser of men: and for that he withdrewe men from the true religion of God,
he was so called.

This Nemroth, called also Nimrod, and Babylonicall Saturn,

The first Monarchy began among the Chaldeis, as Xenophon testifies, and the
posteritee of Cham reigned first, of whom Nemeroth had his beginnynge. All be
(...) that Cham was cursed, yet god wonderfully deferred both the punishment
and promise. Notwithstanding the impyre did not continue in the hands of the
posteritee of Nemroth. For among the Assyrians rose up a new kingdom by Assure,
of whom Niniue was builded, who subdued the city of Babylon, which Diodorus
Siculus does write, and by this occasyon the Monarchy was changed from the
Chaldeis to the Assyrians. Strabo and diverse other make mention of the city of
Niniue, that stands in Assyria, whereby it may be easily gathered, that
Babylon and Niniue were two sundry cities, and not one city, called by diverse
names.



France, and there first reigned.

Occeanus, the son of Cham, first reigned in Aegipte. He by his sister Thetis
had many children. Then came upon him the corrupter of mankind Cham his
father,

Gog with his father Sabus possessed Arabia,

Thuyscon, one of the sons of Noe,

Reu, in the.32. year of his life, begat Saruch:

Ianus in this time brought inhabitants into Hyrcania and Mesopotamia.

Ganges,

Nemroth, the Babilonical Saturn,

Now that we be come to the habitacion of Scithia, we shall briefly declare
their historyes. The nacyon of the Scithians, both in their original
beginninges and empires, were no less renoumed by their women, than by their
men. They thrice obtained the empire of Asia, which they kept tributarie unto
them, until the time of Nynus, they them selfs remaining continually witho ut
the subjection of other princis. They put to shameful flight Darius king of
Persia, they overthrew Zopyrona the captain of Alexander with his army: in
like manner they slew Cyrus with all his power. They rather heard of the Romans,
than felt them. Of them arose the nations of the Parthians, people veraie
laborious and hardye in wars. Among them no crime is so grievous as theft,
for they, having their substance and cattle without houses or other defense,
might have nothing in sauegard, if theft were not sharply punished. As for
gold and silver they despise: as much as other nations desire it. This
co^tinence has taught them righteousness, that they never desire other men's
goods. For the desire of riches is there, where the use of it is. Which
moderacion and absteinyng from other men's good; I wish unto all men: for than
truly so great wars should not so long nor among so many be continued,
neither should the sword destroy more men, than the natural course of does
should take away. Certes, this seems wonderful, that nature should give unto
them that, which the Christians by the godly wisdom of Christ, by the long
precepts and instructions of holy men, can not attein unto. Much more
prevails in them the ignorance of vices, than in us the knowlage of
vertnes. Finally from them has come people fearful and vengeable to all the
world, as the Alanes* Hunnes, Goths, Bulgarois; Slauanois, Turks, and
Tartarians* Moreover the women of that nation, at the river Thermodoon revenged
the death of their husbands, with the slaughter of their ennemies: and lest
that some should seem more happier than other some, they slew all the men that
remained, and forthwith abhorred the desire of matrimony, calling it rather
bondage than marriage. Nevertheless, when that by war they had obtained
peace, and by their valiant prowess had conquered a great part both of Asia
and Europe, stablishyng them a kyngedome by the name of Amazons: Than lest
their nation should decay through lack of men, they used the company of their
borderers. If men children were borne, they were either slain or sent to their
fathers: the women they preserved, exercisyng them not in sowyng, spinnyng, or
idelnesse, but in feats of arms, ridyng, and huntyng. The right pappes of
their children they feared of, that it should be no let to them in
shootynge. For which cause they were called Amazons, that is, having but one
pappe. By this manner exercise they became so strong and hardy, that they feared
not to fight hand to hand with the most valiant princes, Hercules, Thesius,
Achilles, and the great Alexander. But how long time these women continued, or
when they ceased, we can not certainly find, yet we read, that Minothea, one
of their queen's, for the desire too have issue by the great Alexander, came
with.30000. women.25. days journey to him, and after thirtye days returned,
being conceived with child.

Jupiter Belus, the son of Saturn,

Comerus, after the manner of the Scithians, v^ii, because they call carts
veias. For long after the Scithians used carts and chariottes instead of
houses, under which they made their stables, and above their lodginges*

Tyrus, after he had founded Tyrum, with the chief of his people took the sea,
and inhabited Thracia. Arcadius then possessed Arcady; and Aemathius Macedonye.

Saruch, in the.xxx. year of his life begatte Naphor,

In this season began the kingdom of the Sicyonians,

Nachor, when he was.29. years of age, begat Their,

Ianus brought inhabitauntes into the fertile Arabia,

Cham came into Italy, and there,

Triton left Hammon his son king of Libya, took to wife Rhea his sister, but
nevertheless unknowing to Rhea, he begat Dionisius on Amalthea, a young woman,
whom he sent to be nourished into Nysa a town of Arabie.

Belus began to be inflamed with the desires of war, but being prevented by
death, he committed to his son Ninus the charge, to dilate his empire.
Hitherto extends the golden world.

Jupiter Belus is my father, saturn of Babylon is my grandfather, Chus the
Aethiope saturn my great grandfather, saturn of Aegipt my great grandfathers
father, coelus called also Phoenix Ogyges, was my great grandfathers
grandfather From Ogyges to my grandfather the sun, 131. times compassed about
his sercle, from my gra^dfather to my father.65. times from my father to
me^.52. times. Finally when he had reigned.lii. years, by the stroke of an
arowe, he finished all his labors and wars with his life. After whom
succeeded his wife Semiramis.

Thuyscon, the first prince of the Germans, instytuted laws for his people.
contrary did Cham, the Aegiptian Saturn, for he endeavored him to corrupt the
Italians with his wickedness.

In Libia began strife between Rhea and Hammo^ for the adultery committed with
Amalthea, and Rhea sought for Dionisius, that she might destroy him.

Ianus made his last voyage into Italy,

Ianus made his habitacion in Ianiculum a town of Tuscain, which he builded,

Dyonisius the son of Hammon, with great power, expelled Cham and Rhea out of
his fathers royalme, and retained with him Osyris, whom he adopted to his son
calling him by the name of his father Jupiter Hammon, and gave unto him the
hole realm of Aegipt.

At the same time was Pallas a maide^ cast out by the lake Triton, who of the
same Dionisius was adopted to his daughter. She first taught the Libians all
the feats perteining to war.

Their, in the.70. year of his life, begat Abraham, but he had before by an
other wife Nachor and Aram.

The end of the first part.
Prologue to the second part.
HItherto extends the first age, wherein is comprehended all such things as
chanced between the times of Adam and Abraham. For these be the first two
thousand years, during which time the world stood without any prescript
administracion, or certain law, by the word of god. The second age
begins here at the birth of Abraham, and continues to the coming of Christ,
albeit as touching the just number of the years, this world is not complete:
because, as we have warned before, god hastes to the consummacion thereof. Yet
this is the very and propre age of the world, in which circuncision and the
law were given, with certain policies, and the true veneracion of god also
instituted. Wherein also the mighty kingdoms and Monarchies succeeded one an
other. For the world never declared at any time his might and power, as he did
in this age. At this place Eusebius began his chronicles, who following the
veritee of the hebrews, might greatly have profited his posteritee, but
because he ensued the greek exemplars, he greatly erreth in computacion of
years.

The second part.
TO THE end that ye shall know in what place the word and church of God was, we
will show somewhat of the spiritual kingdom.

Abraham, the prince of faith, was borne in Ur, a town of Chaldey, the 292.
year after ye universal flood, the 44. year of the reign of Ninus, and the
1262. year before ye building of Rome, when the true honor and word of god
began to cease in the royalme of Chaldea, Their went from thens to
Mesopotamia, with his son Abraham, because he would not be defiled with ye
wicked supersticions and idolatry of the Babylonia^s. The scripture calls
this idolatry Vr chaldeorunt, that is, the fire of Chaldeie. For when in the
sacrifices of the godly the fire falling from heaven; burned their sacrifyces,
the ungodly folowinge the example of them, kyndled their fire, and so
instituted a new honoring of god, without the knowlage of the coming of
Christ. This fire is called Ori masda, that is to say, the holy fire, which
kings commanded to be borne before them upon horses: For the first occasion of
idolatry, by this fire began among men, before that images were in use.
Therefore Abraham the mighty and renoumed father of the elect nation, left his
country and kynsfolkes, by the commandment of god, and taking with him Lot,
went to soiourne in the land of Canaan. From whens shortly after, thorough
great famine, he was constreigned to go into Aegypte, where he, fearyng the
foul lusts of the Aegypcians, would not be known of Sara to be his wife,
for to aduoide the danger that might chance through the beautee of her. He
there (as Josephus writes) declared god to be the creator of all things,
teaching them the sciences of Arithmetike and Astrology. Finally he returned
into Cananee, where he divided the countreie, Lot choosyng Sodom, and Abraham
Hebro^. After this Lot was taken, whom Abraham delivered. and rescued the
spoils, which the princis of Assyria had taken, and received with blessing of
Melchisedech, king of Salem and high priest of almighty god (called also Sem
the son of Noe) bread and wine: to whom Abraham gave the tenth of his pray.
The apostle says, that this Melchisedech was without genealogy, because his
progeny is not rehearsed in the scripture. Than Abraham begat on Agar his maid
Ismael, of whom came the Ismaelites, afterward called Sarracenes. Finally in
the.99. year of his age, being thryse blessed of God, and his name increased,
the promise of the everlasting testamente, by the circunsion of the flesh
confirmed, he, according to the commandment of god, begat on the old and
barayne Sara his worthy wife, the gentil Isaac, being both promised and
blessed of god: whom he circumcised, and would have offered in sacrifice, had
not god, seeing his prompt obedience, let him. At the last, when this most
holy patriarche had given Rebecca, the daughter of Nathor, to Isaac, to be
his wife, he died, being a.175. years of age, whose holy body his sons Isaac
and Ismael buried in the tumbe, where his wife Sara lay.

Hiberius the son of Iuball, governed the Spaniardes, of whom they were
called Hiberi.

Mogus the son of Samotes, reigned among the Gauls, who builded many towns.

In this year God destroyed Sodom, Gomorre, Adama, and Semois: The cause
Ezechiell writes in this manner: This was the iniquitye of the Sodomytes,
pride, superfluytee of meat, abundance, and idleness, they reched not their
hands to the poor, and did abhomynacions against nature.

This place is now called the deed sea, whose length and breadth contains
certain miles, and at this day is full of pitche, which boileth out
continual vapors, and is a witness of the divine indignacion and punisshment
for so great wickedness. Therefore in this wise god shows oftentimes to the
world, that he will judge and punish sinners, and also preserve the
righteous. Nevertheless Lot was saved with his daughters: but his wife, loking

Rebecca his wife,

Jacob was surnamed Israel, that is the prince of God, of whom the people of
Israel, had their beginning. Afterward, in the.71. year of his life, when
Jacob had gotten the blessinge of his father, he went into Mesopotamia, that he
might avoid the displeasure of his brother, and to take a wife: where he served
seven years his uncle Laban for Rachael his daughter, which fulfilled, Lya the
elder was put in her stead, alledginge that it was not the custom, that the
younger should be first married. Tha^ he tarried seven days, and took Rachael to
wife, upon condition to serve other seven years for her. Upon these wives, and
their two handemaydes, beg at he the.xii. holy patriarchs, from whom
descended the.12. trybes of the Jews. Of whose life might innumerable things
be written, as of their fortitude, prudence, and godliness. Finally after many
aduersitees by him sustained, he descended into Aegipte to his son Joseph,
where he dyinge, blessed his children and nephews, whose corpse his son Joseph
sent again into the land of Canaan.

They that be desirous to read the histories of Jacob at length, may resort to
the holy bible, where in the end of the book of Genesis, it is abundantly set
forth.

Not long before his death, he prophicied most plainly of Christ, and the
vocacion of the Gentiles, whose prophecye, as Uincentius Gallus reherseth was
this. Of the stock of my son Judah shall be borne a virgyn of whom the lamb
immaculate shall be borne, which is the lamb of god, that by grace shall save
all men, whose kingdom shall be everlasting, and never corrupted. Therefore the
great lord shall appear in earth as a man, and shall take upon him a mortal
body, and shall eat as a man. His sterre shall arise in heaven, and he shall
shine in the earth as the son. The heavens shall open over him, and out of
the temple no lyttel sanctificacion of glory shall come to him. He shall pour
out the spirit of grace upon us, and you shall be his children in the truth.
He shall be from Leui a priest, and from Judah a king, he shall be both god and
man, medyator between god and man: and shall take away all darkness, which
is under the heaven: and there shall be peace through the universal world. The
voice of the ill doers shall be against him, not knowing his resurrection. But
the blood of his innoce^cie you shall receive on your hedes. And in his passion
the stones shall cleave a sunder, the son shall be darkened, and all other
things shall be troubled, the invisible spirits shall tremble, and hell shall
be spoiled, he shall open the gates of paradyse, and shall make the thretnynge
swoorde against Adam to stand, and shall give unto his saynctes to eat of the
wood of life. Belial shall be bound by him. Then shall ye se Enoch, Noe, Sem,
Abraham, Isaac, and me your father, rising in joy from the right hand of god,
and shall give power to his children to overcome pernycious spirits: and as
many as believe in him on the earth, shall also rejoice. Then shall all men rise
again, the godly to glory and joy: the ungodly to shame and perpetual
damnacion: and most specially he shall judge Israel, which would not believe in
him. etc.

Joseph, by divine inspiracion, should ensue, that should clean consume the
abundance of the years precedyng* by whose politic provision Egypt was
relieved from famine, and Pharao greatly enriched thereby, for which cause he
made him Regente of his roialme, and named him the saluior of the world.

Of this Joseph Trogus Pompeius, and also his abbreuiatour Iustine, writes in
this manner. Joseph was the youngest amongst the brethren, whose excellent
wit they fearyng, sold him unto strange merchants, by whom he was brought
into Egypt. When he there with diligent study had learned magical sciences, in
short time he grew in great favor with the king. For he was both expert in
prodigies, and also first found out the under standing of dreams. Yea there
was nothing neither of goddis law or man's, that seemed to him unknown: in so
much, that he foreseyng the bareynnesse of the fields to come, gathered the
corns. And so great were his experiences, that all his answers seemed not to
come of man but from god, Moses was the son of Joseph, whose excellent
favor, besides the inheritance of his fathers knowlage, did commend him. But
the Aegypcians, when they were plagued with the scabbes and filthynesse of
body, were admonished, that they should expel him with all the sick people
out of Aegypte, lest that pestilence should infect more. These be the words
of Iustine. They that desire the truth of this history, leat them read the
end of Genesis.

and knowlage. He also first stroke fire out of the flynte, as Pliny
witnesses. Furthermore he invented the use of ringes, but of iron, and
appointed them to be worn on the fourth finger, in honor, and comfort of the
heart vein. Finally, upon the mountain Caucasus, he found out the occasion of
lyghtnyng. Wherup on they feigned, that he stole fire out of heaven.















After the death of Joseph the people of god meruailously increased, and lived
quietely, until they died, to whom Joseph was known. Than by reason of their

Amenophis, king of Aegipt, reigned.xxxi. years, he was surnamed Memnon the
speaking stone,

Morges, the son of Italus, reigned in Italy.



Morges made his cousin Camboblascon king of Italy. Aaron the son of Amram,
nepheu to Leui, and brother of Moses was borne. Incontinent after whose birth
Amenophis commanded all the hebrew children to be drouned. For Aaron was borne
without any ieopardy, but so was not Moses.

Whiles that the Hebrews were thus in misery and thraldom entangled. God in a
vision in the night appeared unto Amram, promisinge him a son to be borne,
who should both deliver his people from the Aegipcians servitude, and also
overthrow them, being plagued, spoiled, and finally drowned in the sea.
Which vision the chance of the thing declared to be true. Therefore as Moses
was borne, his birth (by the will of God) was kept secret, and three months
was he norished at home. But his father, fearing the crueltye of the
Egyptians, made a litell vessel of bulrushes, well pitched within, wherein he
put the child, and set it in the river, commending it to the tuicion of that
lord, who before had promised him to be borne. Then almighty god, shewinge
that not by man's providence, but by his, the effect of all good things be
opteined, saved this litel helpeles child. For he caused Termuth the daughter
of Pharao, to walk to the river side to sport her, where she saw this vessel
swimming on the water. Incontinent she commanded it to be brought to her, and
openyng it, found therein a wonderful fair and goodlye babe, for the which
she not a litell reioysed, and according to the chance named it Moses, which
signifies, preserved from the water. After this, for the favor and
towardness of the child, she adopted him for her son, and caused him to be
instructed in all the learnynges of Egypt. It chanced on a time, that the
king, for his daughters sake, took the child in his arms, and set the
crown upon his head: which Moses, as it were chyldyshly playing, hurled it
to the ground, and with his feet spourned it. But the priest, the soothsayer,
beholdynge this, cried out, and said, that this was he, whom before he had
prophesied should be borne, which would destroy the kingdom of Egypt, except
he were by death prevented. But Termuth excused the child, alledgyng* that his
age had yet no discrecion and for proof thereof caused bournyng coals to be put
to his mouth, which the child with his tungue lycked: whereby he ever after
had impediment in his tongue. By this means their furye at that time was
appessed. In process of time there arose cruel wars between the Ethiopians
and the Egiptians. The Ethiopians destroyed Egypt, took their towns, ouerranne
their countreye even unto Memphis, their principal cyty. On the other part the
Egipcians, by this necessitee compelled, fled for council unto their oracles
and diuinacions: where they received answer, that they must elect an hebrew,
captain of their army, by whose help they should not only expulse the
Ethiopians from their borders: but also bring them under their subjection.
Moses, both for his wisdom and personage, was chosen soueraygne capytayne of
this army, he so polytikely led his host, that vnwaxes he set upon them,
and at the first battle put them to flight, wherein he slew a great
number. And when they in no place were able to resyst him, they fled to their
strong city Saba. In which, whiles they suffered the siege, and Moises often
valyantlye and politikely assauting them, he was of the kings daughter of
Ethyope vehemently loved. Who not able to sustain the power of love, by
certain faithful ministers, required of Moses marriage: he upon condition to
render to him the city, was contented. Which through the means of the maid
was quyckely fulfilled, and he married unto her. By this occasion he subdued all
Ethiope, retournyng to Egypt with great triumph: which prosperitee to the
Hebrews was hope of libertee, and to the Aegypcians cause of great fear.
Wherefore they sought daily occasion how to destroy him. Which Moses
perceyuyng diligently imagined to avoid their deceytes, and denied him self
to be the son of the daughter of Pharao, chosyng rather to be afflicted with
the people of god, than to enjoy sinful pleasure of the world. Wherefore he
slew an Egypcian, which oppressed an hebrew, and fled into Madian, not far
from the mount Sinai, where he was received into the house of Iethro, priest of
that city, who gave to him in marriage his daughter Sephora. There he
continued.xl. years, and kept sheep.

This have I drawn out of the history of Josephus, the residue of Moses life

given by almighty god, with a great and terrible magnifice^ce. At which time
also god gave to them a certain politic governance, and a special kingdom,
in which nothing wanted, that apperteined to the true worshipping of god
priesthode, and civil justice, to the intent that a certain people should be
notably known, among whom the word of god remained: and of whom christ in
time to come should be borne: So that among this people always remained the

repelling their enemies, defended the city, and took the town Orchomenon.

ALBEIT THAT this roialme of England may easily contend with any other
nation, for the antiquitee thereof, as being continually inhabited with people,
from that time that all other countries received inhabitants, yet forasmuch
as by the often civil wars, and invasions of outward ennemies, the
monume^tes and remembraunces of the hystories passed being destroyed, it has
caused no litell ambiguitee and darkness to the certain knowlage of the
original beginning thereof. Wherefore by this occasion compelled, I will brefly
ouerrunne the acts and years of those kings, which reigned, unto the time
that this land was known unto the Romans. The history of which time is
full of errors, and has in it no manifest appearance of truth, as being
written neither of no ancient time, nor yet by no^ credible hystorian. For if
there had remained any veritable monument of these times, surely the worshipful
Beda and Gildas, our countreie men, yea and Caesar the co^querour thereof, would
nothaue omitted them. Never the less I will not descent from the common opinion
thereof, but will also follow it as nere as I may, observing ye just computacion
of the years, and the conferment of histories.

The Judges or dukes of Israel were not by heritage or natural succession. And
therefore the souera^ine governance among them was uncertain, saving only in
the room of the his priests. But God added to them for help often times
certain wise princis, which he chose, now in one place, now in an other.
Wherefore the Israelites tindyng them self grieved with his uncertain
governance, desired of Samuel their high priest, to have a king to rule them as
other countries had: Samuel would not do any thing unadvisedly in so great a
matter. And therefore asked counsel of God: Who showed him self to be greatly
displeased with the unlawful request of his people, and thretned that they
should be therefore grievously punished. How be it he granted their request, and
ordained Saul to be their king. Here the power of kings and governance of
kingdoms was ordained and established by God. Wherefore it is to be marked,
that god was not therefore angry, because he disalowed the power and auctoritee
of kings, but because he was displeased with the unconstant mind and affection
of the people, in chaungyng that kind of governance in the commune weal,
that was by him ordained.

persecucion: during which time David showed many exaumples, both of godly
patience and also of loyal obedience toward his prince. In so much, that when
Saul (by the providence of god) fell in his hands: he only cut a piece of the
hem of his garment, in token that if he had listed at that present, he might
have slain him, and for that deed, afterward greatly repented, that he had been
so bold, as to cut the hemme of the garment of Saul his sovereign lord and

good effect and conclusion. And when he was called again from banishment, he
never remembered any old displeasure, in so much that he always honored
Themistocles, with whom he had perpetual contention in the wealepublike. Of
his temperance this was a great token, that notwithstanding, he had been in

selfs, and for light and small causes vexed each other with cruel deadlye and
continual wars: in so much that by them Greece was utterly destroyed, and
lastly lost their libertee, and were brought in seruage under king Phillip of
Macedon: and for their honest and commendable laws and form of governance,
which they had used before time, succeeded a dissolute order of al things, and
great corrupcion of manners. The first occasion of this war began between
Corcyra and Corinth, with whom the other citees took part, so that all Grecia
was divided. And the chief leaders of one part were the Atheniens, and of the
other the Lacedemoniens. These wars (as Xenophon witnesses) continued.28.

and corrupted their children with perverse doctrine. At which time he so
contempned death, that he would suffer no man to speak for him: and therefore
(as the facion was) when he should drink poison, with a joyous countenance,
he said to Anitus: I bring the good luck and incontinent died. But soon after

GUrguintus son of Beline,



The Romans fought prousperously with the Uolscia^s and Latins, the Antiates
submitted the^ to the Romans. Alexander was king of Macedon one year.

The city of Rome was.v. years without magistrates by means of a great
discord and variance that was meued for promulgation of certain laws: in the
which was desired first, that one of the consulles should be chosen among the
commons: next, that dettes should be diminished: thirdely that none of the
nobles should possess over a certain stinte of lands. Which laws the
noble men would not in any wise suffer to take effect. And therefore the
tribunes, Liciuius and Sexius, which devised those laws, let and forbad
any other magistrates to be chosen, the space of.v. year, and then were they
constreigned by external war for that time, to break up their contention,
which shortly after they renewed. Epammondas, a Thebane borne, in sundry
qualitees both of the body and mind was renoumed. In all kinds of music he
was perfectly instructed, and daunced therewith excedyngly well. There was no
virtue, that in him was lacking, he oftentimes refused great sums of money
and rich presents sent to him by princes, although he were pore, saying: If
the thing were honest, which he were required to do, he would do it, because
it was good without any reward: if it were ill and not honest, all the goods
of the world should not make him to do it: If it were profitable unto his
country, he was bounden and ready to do it freely: if it were otherwise, no
riches might counteruaile the love that he bare to his commune weal. In
bataile he overcame the Athenians and Lacedemones, and in one day had the
victory of al Greece. Finally, in a conflycte at Mantinea, between the Thebanes
and Lacedemones, he was wounded unto death with a long spear, the head
remaining still in his body: yet retained he life, until his host had the
victory, and than said: I have lived long enoughe, for I dye unvanquished. He
was so poor, that he was buried at the charges of the city.

The third wars of Carthage began, in which they chose the two Asdruballes
capitaines of their footmen, and Phan^as captain of their horsemen. Cato
persuaded the Romans utterly to destroy Carthage, consydering (as he said) the
Romans to degenerate little and little from the prowes and virtue of their
ancestors. Wherefore if that mighty city should persist in that state knowinge
the ignauy, nicitee, and sluggishenesse of the Romans, nothing were more
certain, but that they would again contend for the empire, and oppress the
Romans, subduing them under their power, but Scipio Nasica was of contrary
opinion, he would not have Carthage charge to be destroyed. First because it
were an dishonest thing, that the Romans should show so great tyranny and so
cruelly to slay such a people. Moreover it were unprofitable: for without that
town, Aphrica cold be kept in due obedience, except they would turn all
into a wilderness. Thyrdelye, it was very necessary that the Romans should
have such a city adversary unto them whereby their people might be incited to
prowess and actiuitie, otherwise it should chance, that they should contend
together in civil wars, if they had not a broad an enemy,

About this time, thorough the wars and dissencion of the Iues, there arose
among them sundry sects and opinions in their religions, of which there
were.iii. sorts.

The first were called Pharisei, that is, segregate or chosen. They used
certain constitucions of men beside the law of Moses, by which they were
segregate from the residue of the people. They reputed them selfs better
then all other, they observed feigned fastes, prayed commonly in the streets,
that they might be seen and called masters. Their learning was some what
better the^ the others. For they taught the immortality after this life, and
that god would punish sin: they bel^ued also Messiah to come to save such as
believed, and to judge such as sinned.

The second sect were Sadduceis, they cloked their wickedness under a glorious
name. For Sadducei is as much as just or holy. They taught, that there was
neither angel, spirit, nor life after death: that god gave the law only for
this, that honestly and quietly we should live receiving of god here in this
life the rewards of justice. They interpreted the scriptures according to the
judgment of man's reason: neither any other thing would they here, and as
concerning that which pertained to the manner of their living, they were plain
Epicures. A wonderful thing to be hard, that such ethnike opinions should crepe
In among the pecu^ar people of god, and that so ^^rre, that openly they were
not afraid to teach, and constant lo^ to affirm, that after this life* there
remained none other life.

Essei ^ere the third who considering both the Phariseis and Sadduceis, under
an honest pretense of name to follow their lusts and desires* neither almost
to do any thing that was worthy for their profession: therefore thought they to
declare the seueritee of their life in deeds and would be called Essei, that is
laborers, and studied to be seen holy and for the most part led an
Anabaptistical life, absteining from matrimony, and willinge all things to be
common among them, they delited in ^^eane apparel, and prayed before the son
rising.

only withstode.40000. Romans, but also vainquished the^ oftentimes. For
which cause Scipio the younger, who destroyed Carthage, was sent thither. He
enclosed the city about with a great trenche. Wha^ the Numa^tines by long
siege were sore famished, they determined to finishe their misery with death:
tha^ with a sudden erupcion they brake forth upon their enemies: And (if
Scipio had not ben there present) the Romans had fled away, so egerly they
assailed them: but by the great multitude of the romans, they were driven
back, and many of them slain: than the residue in good order retired into the
town, and closed their gates, where with the sword poison, and fire they
consumed them selfs, their goods and their city, leuyng neither man nor goods
for a spoil to the romans.

Marcus Tullius Cicero, was consul of Rome, with C. Antonius, whose divine
eloquence, abundant lerning sharpness of wit: dexteritee in acts, and most
arde^t love toward the common weal of his country can not be sufficiently
expressed by no mortal man's tunge or pen. His ancestors were named
Cicerones because that Tullius Appius a noble king of Uolscis, and one of that
progeny, had on his nose a mark like a chich which is a kind of pulse
called Cicer. He so profyted in the eloquence of Greek and Latin, that not
only his companions were in a merueilous admiracion of him but also Appolonius,
the most excellent orator at that time, in hearing him, was greatly abashed,
and kepinge silence a long space, said at the last: Truly, Cicero I praise
the, and marvel at the, but I lamente greatly the fortune of Greece, when I
consider, that not only noblenes in deeds of arms and marciall affairs, is
taken from us by the valyantnesse and puissance of ye Romans, but also that
the great praise and glory of lerninge, which was only left unto us is now by
the translated to Rome Which saying was founden afterward very true, for look
what subtilitee is in Logike, what commoditee and secret knowlage in
phylosophie moral and natural: he knew and declared the same in latin in
most perfect eloquence. And (which is to be wondered) atnotwithstanding, that
he being a very young man, came to practice in Rome, and had studied
abundantly the civil laws, and was meruailously occupied in great and
weightye causes, and after that he was senator, was continually (as it seemed)
most busye about the weal public, yet he that does read his works
(although we have not the third part of them, which he wrote) shall think,
that he never did any other thing but read great auctours, and wrate books.
And yet did he exploit by his wisdom and diligence many great enterprises,
for the commoditee and sauegarde of his country, as well in war as in peace.
For the which the Senate and people gave to him first before any other, the
name of Father of his country.

Catiline enterprised his conspiracy, which by the great wisdom and
diligence of Cicero was suppressed and Catiline slain in battle by Antonius,
who list to read the history at length, let him resort to a book entitled

is abundantlye and elaquently set forth.

The preface of Thomas Lanquet to the second part of the histories of England.
I Have hitherto briefli run over the lives of.72. kings, which reigned here
in Britain from the arrival of Brute unto the coming of Caesar: the history
whereof (as I said before) is very uncertain and obscure. Yet nevertheless I
have not varyed from the vulgar opinion thereof, but have brought the same in to
a more certain order, conferring them with the other histories and gestes of
the world, whereby they have a better appearance of truth. But now, that I am
come to this time, in which the Britons began to be known to the Romans,
and other nations of the world, having also the help of credible historiens,
which before I lacked, I shall the more veritably and in better order set
forth our histories. And for the better declaracion of this chronicle, you
shall understand, that the numbres set in the inner side of the page, signify
the years of the reigns of the kings of Britain, whereby may be perceived in
what year of the reign of a king, any notable thing in the world was done.
As for the historye of Caesar I have gathered it out of his commentaries, and
out of the worshipful Beda whom I think more credible than our new
historiens.

When C. Iullus Caesar had warred seven years in France and Germany, but they
not hable to resist the violence and force of the Romans, hid them selves in
woods, and with sodeine eruptions oftentimes invaded them. But in the mean
time their strongest city Troynoua^t* submitted it self to Caesar, delivering
unto him hostages: which example also the other cities followed. Whereby
Cassiuelan after many losses, was constreigned to give pledges, and to agree
that Britain should be tributary to the people of Rome Then Caesar, like a
conqueror with great noumbre of prisoners, sailed into France. Thus ended the
wars which he made in Britain, whereby he rather opened o way for his
successors to come to the same, tha^ that he delivered to them the dominion
thereof. This conqueste was made.2255. years after the universal floude.1057.
after the arrival of Brute.702. after the buyldinge of Rome, in the second
year of the.182. Olimpiade, the.1116. year before the conquest made by Willa^
of Normandy. and.1595. years before this present year of our lord.1547

The civil wars between Pompeius and Caesar began, in which.ccc.M. men
perished. Caesar in his his absence required the second time to be consul.
Marcellus the consul withstode it, and the senate also decreed, that Caesar
should not enter the city, without he dimissed his army. For which cause
Caesar being displeased, came from Rauenia, passing over Rubicon, to Ariminium.
In the mean while Pompeius, with the consulles, fled to Dyrra^hiu^ in Greece,
and Caesar entered Rome, spoiled the tresoury, and besieged Marsiles.

Aristobulus, being delivered by Caesar, went into Judea, where he was poisoned,
and Alexander his son put to death by Scipio.



Pompeius, sleing to Alexandria in Egypt was slain by the tutours of the young
Ptolome, with the seal of his ringe, that they should do no wrong to any man
by the way, wherein he declared him self to be not only a valiant, but also
a just and righteous captain.

Caesar entered Alexandria, and being provoked to batail, he vanquished them,
and set on fire the nauye of the Egipcians, the flame whereof invaded the
lybrarye of Philadelphus, wherein were burned.40000. books. The king
rebellinge again, was slain with all his army, and Cleopatra his sister,
restored to the royalme. Then went he into Pontus against Pharnaces, the son of
Mithridates, whom at the first encountre he ouerthrue

C. Julius Caesar,

Cato for grief and sorrow of heart that he had, that his country should by
Caesar be brought in seruage and thraldom, slew him self in U^ica. Iuba, the
king of Mauritane: hired one to ryd him of his life. Petr^ius and Scipio
killed them selfs. And Caesar commanded the Neph^eus of the greatte Pompei,
and his daughter Pompeia, to be put to death.

Caesar entered Rome with four triu^phes, of the Pompeis was put to flight, the
one of the brethren being slain, the other fleing away. After which
battle, Caesar finished those civil wars, which during the space of.v.
years, troubled the whole world. Antipater by Caesar was co^stituted procuratour
of Judea

Caesar returned to Rome, he reformed the state of the common weal, amended
the calender, reducinge the order of the year, to the course of the son,
found out the cause of the leap year, and in his honor and memory, the
people attributed to him the month Quintilis, which after his name was called
Julius. But he continued not passing.v. months in rest, for waringe insolent
against the senators, and taking their lybertee from them, there conspired
against him to the number of.260. senators and gentilme^, among whom Brutus
and Cassius were chief, Which in the Ides of March, when Caesar came into the
senate house, with.xxiii. wou^des, he was slain among the senators. Thus Caesar
lost all that which with the blood of.lx. M. citezens, and.1192000. his
ennemies, he had gotten. And as he had filled all the world with his civil
blood: likewise now he filled the senate with his own blood. After this sort
Caesar finished his life, a man in featnes of war excellinge al other, he

Cyreneus presidente of Siria,

The preface of. Tho. Languet to the third part of his chronicle.
IN my former books I have declared those things (according to my power)
which have chanced during the time that the laws of nature and Moses were in
their force, taking my beginning from the creacion of the first man Ada^. And
continuinge the same through the thick mistes and darkness of the old words
I am now at length come unto the birth of the new man, our saluiour Jesus
Christ, where I purpose with ye Legales, ceremonies, shadows and errors of
the ancient time to finishe those parts, and now with the bright beams of
that everlasting son, whose risinge has lightened all the world, to begin this
my last book.

When Caesar Augustus by the will of god had stablyshed most sure peace through
the world, our redemer Jesus Christ veraye god and man, upon whom peace
waited, was horn in the.xiii. year of the reign of Augustus after the
viuersall floude.23^5. years from the birth of Abraham.2^12. years. After
the departure of the Israelites out of Egipte, 1509. years. From the arryuall

Solomon.1029. years: from the buyldinge of Rome, 752. years. After the
captyuytye of Babylon 614. years, and in the last year of the.194. Olympyade.

Ianiuer following, began the second year.

JESUS of Nazareth king of Jews, and only head of chrystyanes, self to be
a very man, and after the innumerable documentes and beneficial deeds
(passing man's power) openly showed unto his unkind people the Jews, by
which he declared him self to be true god, as it was before written in the
prophets: he was by the elders of the Jews, and people (his disciple Judas
Scarioth betrayinge him) taken, accused, endited, scorned, scourged, crowned
with thorns, crucified between thieves, and even than all things fulfilled,
with the quakinge of the earth, and darkness of the son, he died. After
which being buried, he loused hell, and the third day folowinge, like a
conqueror of sin death, and hell, he rose again, from which time
being.xl. days conuersaunt with his, in the xxxiii. year of his life, with
glorious triumph he ascended to the heavens unto his father, from whense he
came. Where being the only* mediator, intercessour, and advocate of his,
sittinge on the right hand of god, his father, shall in the end of the
world, be judge over all the living and the dead, rendringe to every man,
according to his deserving, to the faythefull certainlye life, but to the
unfaithful everlasting death. Than good and evil segregated, with the whole
world purged and pacifyed, our lord Jesus Christ, the only and very
almighty emperor of the world, as he has from the beginning, so does he
now, and for ever shall reygne: to whom every knee of celestial, terrestrial,
and infernal creatures shall bow, and every tongue shall confess, that Jesus
Christ is the lord, to the glory of God the father: to whom be all glory
world without end. Amen.

The printer.
Hitherto the said young man Thomas Lanquet continued this history called the
Epitome of Cronicles, and was than attached with a grievous sickness, whereof
he dyed* when he was of age.xxiiii. years: on whose soul god have mercy, and
the same followed and finished, by Thomas Couper, who after instant request to
him made, was at length content, to take upon him the peine, for he well
considered, what labor and trauaill it was, according to the first inuencion,
to search and read over so many and diverse histories and cronicles, to
accomplish the said purpose.

An epistle to the reader.
FRom the beginning of the world, to this time of the birth of our savior
Christ, the studious young man Thomas Lanquet, not without great labor and
diligence, brought his Chronicle. Whose enterprise, and the honest affection,
that he therein declared toward his country, I think worthy memory. For if
he might have gone through as he bego^, and well brought forward the same:
undoubtedly it would greatly have delighted them that take pleasure to read
the notable and famous things done long before our time. For he has
briefly set forth the gestes and acts of forayne and strange countries,
and therewith iuigned the history of this realm of England, after the opinion
of most writers, even from the first arriving of Brutus, in such wise, that a
diligent reader may gather, the variable state and condition of all countries
and nations at all times. But death (which spares no man, ne can be
eschewed) brake his course, and (as it were) trypped him in the mids of his
raze, that he could not atteyne to the mark, whereat he ran. Wherefore, lest
they that desire the profitable knowledge of histories, should be destituted of
so great a commoditee: and lest the fruits of so diligent a labor should lie
hid, and turn to the profit of no man: At the instance of certain of my
nyghest friends, whose requests (the matter so standing) I could not well
deny: I have taken upon me to fynishe this cronicle, although in deed. I
greatly dispaired, that I should be able to accomplish the same. But when I
considered, first, though it were an hard matter, yet might it be ouercomen
with labor: than, how profitable the exercise should be for me, to read and
peruse so many good auctours, as were necessary for the performaunce of the
same: Thirdly, how honest a labor it was, so to employ the vacant time that
I had from other necessary businesses. I sho^e from me unprofitable
bashefulnesse, and have enterprised, not only to finishe this warke, but also
(after the oversight and correction of other men) have suffered the same to be
published. Wherefore you (gentle reader) shall take well in worth this my
boldness, and persuade your self (as the truth is) that I was moved to
this exercise, rather of good will* to profytte my natural country, and to
do pleasure to other men, than for any fame or aduaunceme^t, that I hoped might
come to me thereby. And if I se, ye take it well in gree, vndoughtedly you shall
encourage me hereafter, to goo in hand, with some exercise, that shall
perchance turn to more profytte, and pleasure, of them which be desirous
of honest knowledge.

Vale.

AFter the death of Octauius Augustus, the second Caesar, that things happened
in Rome, that sometime does in all commonweals, at the decesse of great
princes and rulers, that is sedicio^, unquietness, and trouble. For the
soldiers being as than in Pannonie, raised a great sedicion, and in their
rage beatte and murdered diverse of their tribunes and other officers, which
co^mocion after much peines was lastly quyeted by Drusus the son of Tiberius.
In like manner, and for like causes, was great trouble and unquietness in the
host that lay in Germany. At which time, when Germanicus their captain,
exhorts them to quietness, the soldiers obstinately refused the empire of
Tiberius, and proffered to make him their emperor, but Germanicus would rather
have slain him self, with his own weapen, the^ by such unlawful means, to
obtain the imperial auctoritee: And moreover, the commons of the city of
Rome, and diverse of the nobles also, having in their hertes (as it were) a
natural hatred toward the Monarchy, or high power of Cesars: divised and
imagined with them selfs, diversely, how to extinguishe the imperial
auctoritee, and bring the city to her pristinate for me and governance of
consulles, which thing they more ernestlye desired, for so much as they had as
yet, fresh inmemorie, the swetenes of their ancient libertees, and the fame of
man^e noble men, which by Julius and Augustus, had been outlawed and put to
death. And also because they feared the proud and cruel nature of Tiberius,
who was named to succeed Augustus in the empire But all this notwithstanding.
Tyberius with such craft and dissimulacion handeled the matter, that he not
only obtained the imperial auctoritee, but also seemed to take it upon him
against his will.

There was at this time no notable war, sauinge that the Romans made fierce
war upon the Germans, rather to revenge the infamy: that. Q. Uarus had
received at their hands, than to enlarge their empire which at this time had
spread it self well ner over all the world.

put to death by Tyberius) For this servant a good space after his masters
death, came abroad, and named him self Agrippa, to whom both in age and
person he was not much unlike, by which means he gathered to him great
companies and came toward Rome: but shortly after his companies were
disparkeled, and he taken and put to death by Tyberius.

the god of Aegypte, would have the company of the said Paulina. To whom the
chaste woman gave light credence, because it was tha^ counted a great renoume,
to have to do with the gods. And by this mean was Paulina, in the night
season, abused by Mundus, in the temple of Isis, under the name of Anubius,

worse, whereby the name of the Friscians was famous in Germany.

Caius Caligula, the son of Germanicus and.4. Caesar, were.1500^0. sacrifices
offered in thanks geuinge to the gods, that he being of the stock of
Germanicus, happened to be their emperor. This man at the first beginning,
was of manners right pleasant and commendable But after he became so detestable
in pride, incontinency and beastly crueltee, that he seemed rather a monster of
a man, and filthye example of all vice, than a prince or governor of a public
weal. He used to sytte in the temple among the gods, sumptuouslye arrayed in
purple and gold, offering him self to be worshipped of the people, he
defloured three of his own sisters, and took other men's wives vyolently from
them. Often times he bewailed the condition and state of his age, that it was
not made famous with any notable or great calamitees of the common weal, for
certain displeasure that he conceived toward the Romans, he wished
ernestlye, that all the people of Rome, had but one neck, that he for his
pleasure might destroy such a multitude. Through this great mutacion of
manners in Caligula, happened this proverb to rise: There was never a better
prince at the beginning, nor a worse tyran at the endinge.

Caligula delivered Agrippa out of prison, and in the steed of his fetters
and yro^s, gave to him a crown, and a chiane of gold of the same weighte as
his yrons were, and made him king over that part of Judea, that Phylyp
governed before time. And not long after added there to, the dominion of Herod,
and condemned Herod to perpetual banishement, where he died miserably.

In Judea Uitellius deposed Caiphas, out of the high priests room, and
ordained an other in his place called Jonathan, the son of Anna.

Caligula commanded divine honors to be given to him,

be set in good order, upon the sea banks, and his springalles and other
abilementes and engines of war to be disposed against the Occian sea, as
though he would comquere the sea: and then commanded his soldiers to gather
Muscle shelles, saying, that they were the spoil of the sea, which for his
conquest and victory was due to the temple of Jupiter.

Petronius, the president of Surrie, was commanded by Caligula to enforce and
compelle the Jews to suffer his images in their temple of Jerusalem, which
thing the Jews very ernestly withstode, and desired Petronius, that be would
put them all to present death, rather then they should live to see their law
broken.

Great persecucion of the Iues in Babylon, and also in a city of greece named
Seleucia, the causes whereof, Josephus writes abundantly in his last book of
the antyquities of the Iues.

The ninthe day of the Kalendes of February, Caligula was slain by Chereas the
tribune and other gentlemen of Rome,

About this time, Aegiptus was king of the Aethyopes, Suirtingus of the
Saxones, Lodrike of the Pectes.

Claudius uncle to Caligula, was made emperor by the foolish rashenes of the
soldiers, more given to dice play than was comely: of the which (as some
write) he made a book. He was also veraie forgetful, in so much that when he
had given sentence of condemnacion upon certain persons,

Scribonianus, captain of the Romans in Delmitia rebelled and named him
self emperor. At which time the host which favored Scribonianus, could not
by any means spread the baners, nor remove the standerdes out of their
places: with which miracle the soldiers being meued, slew Scribonianus.

Betus the son of Simon, bishop of Jerusalem.

Claudius the emperor, confirmed the kingdom of Agrippa, and added thereto the
hole dominion of Judea and Samaria, as Herod his graundfather had before him,
by which occasion Judea was again holy subject to one king.

James the brother of Johan,

Claudius the emperor led an army into Britain, to claim again the
tribute, that was denied by king Guiderius, which he recovered without greatte
war or bloudeshede, as say the latin cronicles: but the english histories
assirmen that he had given to him strong battle* In the which a Romayne
captain named H^n^o changed his shield and armur; and put on him the armur of
a Brito^, and so mengled with the Brito^s entered there as the king was, and
slew him: at which time Aruiragus, the kings brother, seeing that sodeine
mischeue, armed him with the cognisaunce of the king, and so for king
continued the fight, with such manhood, that the Romans at that time were
put to the worse.

ARuiragus the youngest son of Cymbeline, and brother of Guyderius, was
ordained king of Britain. Claudius the emperor after diverse happes of battle,

Claudius retourninge from Britain subdued to the empire the Islands called
Orcades.

Marsus succeeded Petronius in the province of Surry who for envy of Agrippa,
deposed Mathias, and made Eleon^us high priest in his room.



A great dearth and famine in Judea, which was greatly helped by the
liberalitee of the queen of the Adhiabens. Saint Paul also gathered among
the gentiles which were converted to the faith, for the relief of the
christians being in Jerusalem.

The Britons (because their king Aruiragus) as says the Scottishe history)
had repudiated his wife Uaoda, to marie the Roman lady Genissa, having aid

captain.

which at that time by the providence of god were present in Some.

Herod king of Chaleis ended his life: whose kingdom Claudius gave to the
younger Agrippa, son of Herod agrippa, whom we spoke of a litell before.

The Parthians, being weary of the cruel dominion of Gota^^ts, which had by
force and tyranny advanced him self to that kingdom desired of the Romans
to have Mahardates the son of Uonones to be their king, who not long after was
overcome in battle of the said Gotarzis, and with great reproach driven out of
his kingdom

Uologeses, emperor of the Parthes.

Claudius, after the death of his wife Messalina, married Agrippina: through
whom began much business and trouble in Rome, for she endeavored to marye
her son Nero to Octauia, daughter of Claudius, and sought diverse occasions to

Maximinus, which a little before had taken on him the name of an emperor in
the east, kept secret the commandments of Galerius: wherein he forbade the

and in Westmer land gave to him the second battle, in which Octauius was
chased, and Traherne was victour, who pursued him so egrely, that Octauius
forsook the land, and sailed to Norwaie.

OCtauius, repairinge his army, history he was troubled with often wars by
the Romans. Polidore says, that this realm was in good quiet all the time
of Constantine and his successors, until the.v. year of Gracian, and makes
no mention of this Octauius, which thing I speak not for any reproach to
Polidore (whom I know right well to have followed most certain and
commendable auctours) but only to show to the reader the diuersitee of
histories.

did persecute each other: and specially the Arrians so furiously raged, that

extreme necessitee, bounden not to aid the king of Armonye their sworn
friend to which thing the Romans were never constreigned before that day.

Iuuian called from banishment the bishops, which were exyled in the time of
Constancius and Julian, and shortly after finished his life of an ague, when
he head reigned.viii months

About this time one Eugenius was made king of Scotts. Here the Scottishe
historye makes a long process of the fyerce and cruel war that he kept
against Maxymus the Romayne captain, and the Pictes and Britains, which I
think to be of no more credyte then the residue of their history, that they
have feigned from the beginning. For undoubtedly if they had put the Romans
to so much trouble, as their cronicles show, both in the time of the conquest
and after: Caesar, Tacitus, Ptolemei, Pliny, and other would have made some
mencyon of the Scotts, as they did of the Trinobantes, Cenimagnes,
Segontiaces, Bidrices, Brigantes, Silutes, I^cenes and diverse other.

Ualentinian followed in the empire, and reigned.xx years.

Procopius by treason usurped imperial auctoryty in Bythinia.

In Phrigia the soldiers of Procopius forsook him and went to Ualens:

favor in the emperoures court, wrought much trouble to the catholic bishops,

Ualens went with an army against the Goths which passing the river Danuby,
ouerrode the country of Thrace.

Al Constantinople fell haylestones of wonderful bygnesse, with which many men
were slain.

In France wull descended from the air myxed with rain.

Ualentinian made Gratian his son Augustus.

The Frenchemen, about this time, first obtained their name of Ualentinian, to
be called Franci, that is fierce and valiant, because they chased the Ataines
out of the marshes and fennes of Meotides: and for that deed he forgave them
ten years tribute. They were called before Sicambri, and had their beginning
of the Troianes

A very great earthquake in Bithinia, which overthrew the city Nicea.

Basilius was famous, a man of incomparable virtue and learning, borne in
Cappadocia. He was taught of his father as well grammar as other learninges

to the study of scripture, and louinge Basile entirelye, came into the schole,
where he read in a cheer, and taking him by the hand brought him to a
monasterye, where leyinge a part all books of philosophye, they only

made bishop of Cesaria.

The frenchmen denied to pay any more tribute, wherefore the emperor made
fierce war against them.

ended his life, with a sodeyne bleding, at a town called Brygon.





Appollinaris, of Laodicea, taught, that the diuini^^e and humanite of Christ
were both of one nature.

license to inhabit Pannonia.

The Scotts say, that about this time, after long and cruel war, they
were utterly extermined and dreuen out of their realm into Ireland and other
countries, by Maximus the Roman the Pictes, and Britains.

The Goths desired Ualens to send them certain learned men to instruct them
in the religion of christ, who sent to them Arrians, by whom all the Goths
were infected with that heresye, in the which they continued a long time.

Theodosius, father of that Theodosius: to be beheaded.

The Goths, which before fled to Ualens, not susteigninge the avarice of a
Roman Duke, named Maximus, rebelled and slew a great number of men in
Thracia, and overcame Ualens also in battle: who being chased, fled into a
cottage, which, the Goths that pursued, compased and set on fire. And there
was Ualens burned of them, whom he caused to be corrupted with the heresy of
Arrius.



Theodotius vanquisshed the Goths, and by force drove them out of Thracia,
and after made league with Athanaricus their king.



Theodotius ordained by open decree,

been a schism of long time.



Ualentinian, the brother of Gratian, being driven out of Italy, fled into
the east to Theodotius: of whom he was with all gentilnesse interceined.

Whiles Maximus was occupied in the wars in Italy, Melga, king of Pictes,

Milleine had knowlage, he excommunicated the emperor, and forbade him to enter
in to the church, until he had done open penance. To whom Theodotius
gentillye obeyed, and for that deed had Ambrose ever after in most high
estimacion and reverence.

weste, and aduaunsed Eugenius to the imperial crown.

Pla^illa, the wife of Theodotius, dyed* a woman of great sanctimonie. She

them all things necessary with her own hands.



In the time of Theodotius, a child was borne in Palestine, being divided from
the nauel upward as it were into two bodies, every part having all senses and
perfect members of a man. When the one did eat, the other did not,
sometimes the one played with the other, as it were two children: The one part

was wonderfullye learned. At the beginning he favored the opinions of them,
which be called Maniches: but by the continual prayer of his good mother,
Monica, and the persuasion of holy saint Ambrose, he was converted to the true
faith. They both being replenisshed with the holy ghost, sange the psalm,

into Atalye, and obtained aid of Honorius the emperor, and shortly after,
with.5000. men of war, vanquished his brothers army (in the which were.70000.
fighting men) and commanded him to be strangled to death.

The same Mascazell being proud with the success of that battle, named him
self emperor, and within few days was slain of the soldiers.

About this time as witnesses Uolateran,

A controversy was in the church, whether god were corporate and had a body,
and all members thereof, to the likeness of man: which opinion was
obstinatelye affirmed of certain simple and unlearned monks, or solitary
persons of Aegipt.

This opinion caused so much trouble in the church that Theophilus bishop of
Alexandria, and Epiphaneus of Cipres, endeavored to have disanulled and burned
the books of Origin, for that they seemed to teach the contrary. They vexed
also Chrisostomus, because he would not consent thereto.

The Goths,

He intised also the Aleynes and Uandales to take arms against the Romans.





The frenchemen, passinge the river Rhine, inhabyted Treueris in Gallia, and
the country lyinge there about.



Britain about this time was vexed with the irrupcions of Melga king of Pictes
and other barbarous people.



Two terrible nations of the Goths were in arms against the empire: the
Ostrogothes, being Paganes, which had a mighty and vallaunt captain, named
Rhadagasius, and the west Goths, which were christined and had to their
leader Alaricus.



Ruffinus, governor of the east, intised Alaricus king of the wisigothes, to
make war upon the emperor Arcadius, to the intent that in time of the
tumultie, he might (by his conspiratours) be advanced to the imperial
authority: whose treason being disclosed he was slain of the soldiers, and
his head set up at Constantinople with his right hand.

Caianus also trusting to the aid of the Goths, raised civil war,

Stillicon prolonged the war with the Wisigothes and therefore was he
commanded of Honorius to make peace with them. Honorius also granted to the
Goths to inhabit in France, which at that time was possessed of the
Frenchmen, Aleines, and other barbarous people, that were steered up by the
counsel of Stillico.

Constantius, a man of no estimacion or dignitee,

Constantine, sent his son Constans into Spain, against two noble men,
Dyndimus and Uerinianus, which kept the streightes of the mountayns called
Pyrenei both against him and the barbarous people.

Arcadius emperor of the east,

Theodotius surnamed the younger,

The U^^d^^es being chased of the Goths west out of France into Spain.

At^alus affectinge the empire in Rome, was immediately brought in subjection.

Stillico, contrary to the leag ue, Saul with a company of soldiers. Who
coming suddenly upon the said Goths slew of them a great number, with which
injury their king Alaricus being irritated after he had revenged him on the
soldiers of Stillico, in his fury turned his whole power against the city of
Rome, which shortly after he took. And when he had spoiled it, by the space
of.iii. days departed and took with him Placidia the emperors sister, whom
after he gave in marriage to Ataulphus his kinsman.

Now was the treason of Stillico detected, which he had of long time
dissimuled and kept close: and he therefore was beheaded, with his son
Eucherius.

At this time the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy of the world, which
had of long time flourished, began first to decline, which happened from the
beginning of the city.1163. after the kings were expelled.919 years.



Constans, the son of Constantine, who was sent into Spain, was murdered of
his own Duke Gerontius: whereby Honorius recovered to his dominion, both the
land of Britain, and the soldiers, which favored Constantine.

Heroes a holy man, was by the fury of the people put from his byshoprike of
Or^iau^ce,

Ataulphus was ordained king of wisigothes, who intended the utter destruction
of the city of Rome, and to have builded an other city in the fame place,
which should be called Gothia, and the emperors thereof Ataulphi. But he was
mitigated by the gentill intercession and prayer of his wife Placidia, the
emperors sister.

Two brethren* called Iouius and Sebastianus* which in France took on them
princelye auctoritee, were subdued and slain.

Pelagius, an horrible heretic, lived in Britain. He taught, that men were not
saved and justified by the mere mercy of god, for the death and merit of Jesus
Christ.

Attalus, by the healpe of the Goths, usurped imperial authoritee, in France,
and passed from thens into Spain,

Heraclianus, a Roman Duke, being sent into Afrike against the factours of
Attalus, traitorously took on him imperial auctoritee.

The Burgonnions obtained the part of France nere to the river of Rhine.

Heraclianus, by the counsel of his companion Sabinus, prepared a wonderful
navy, in the which were 4070. ships: and with them made toward Rome
against the emperor. Shortly after his arrival, he was discoumfited, and
shamefully put to flight, in such wise, that he was constreigned to fly to
Carthage in a small ship, where he was slain shortly after.

The Jews, which from the time of Alexandre the great* to this day,
inhabited the city of Alexandria,

A woman* named Hippacia (so excellentlye learned, that she passed all the
philosophers of that time) did read openly in the philosophy schole at
Alexandria.

Attalus, the traitor, being forsaken of his adherentes, was taken in Afrike,
and sent to the emperor.

The Goths slew their king Ataulphus, for that he desired peace with the
Romans, and chose for him Regericus: whom for like cause they also murdered,
and lastly advanced to be their king a noble man, called Wall^a: who after
certain misfortune on the sea, contrary to their exspectacion, made league
with Constantius the Roman, which at that time had subdued the Barbarous
people in Spain.

Zozimus, Pope, ordained that no priest should drink in common tauernes.

Ua^lia, king of the Goths, restored to the emperor his sister Placidia,

A counsel of.207. bishops was assembled at Carthage against the heresy
of Pellagian and other,

The emperor Honorius triumphed for the victories atchiued by the marciall
knightehoode of Constans his Duke.

Pharamunde, the son of Marcomirus, a man garnisshed with all knightly
virtue,

Constantius confirmed the league made with the wisigothes,

Honorius made Co^sta^tius fellow with him in ye empire.



Which request was hard, and a captain sent, with a legion of knights: who
within few days chased their enemies out of the land: and teachinge them to
make a wall of turns, and stakes from the water of Humbre to the Scottisshe sea
(wherewith their ennemies might be kept back out of the land) took leave of
the Britains, and departed.

Barbaranes, king of the Persians, did persecute the Christians:

Castinus, a Duke of the Romans, was sent against the Uandales, which wasted
the lands of the empire in Spain. Against whom he somewhat prevailed by the
healpe of a valiant knight named Bonifacius, which came out of Afrike to
aid him in the businesses of the empire. But Bonifacius shortly after, not
susteigning the envious tyranny of his captain Castinus, returned into Afrike,
afterwhich time Castinus atchiued nothing worthy memory.

Placidia, the wife of Constantius,

Honorius emperor of the weast, departed out of this life at Rome.

A certain Roman, named Ioannes, by the aid and maintenance of Castinus,
invaded the imperial crown. This Ioannes made into Afrike, entendinge both to
vanquishe the forenamed Boniface enemy of Castinus, and also to subdue that
country to his dominion.

In the mean time Theodotius made Ualentinian, the son of Placida, Caesar:
and sent him with aid into Italy, to recover the imperial auctoritee. Who
not long after conquered the city Rauenna, which shut the gates at his
coming, vanquisshed Ioanne the tyranne, sent in banishement Castinus, and
pardoned Aetius, a noble man, for by his means he quieted the Hunnes, which
had armed them against the Romans.

Ualentinian, by the ordinance of Theodotius, was proclaimed Augustus,

Nere about this time the Britains were invaded again by the Pictes and
Scotts: which notwithstanding the foresaied wall, that was made by the
Romans, spoiled the country very sore. So that they were driven to seek for
new healpe of the Romans: who sent to them a company of soldiers: which
again chased the Pictes, and made a wall of stone of the thickenesse of.viii.
foot, and in heyght.xii. foot. Which thing when they had done, comforting
the Britains, and admonishinge them hereafter to trust to their own manhood
and strength, they returned again to Rome.

Bonifacius, before mentioned, was famous and in great auctoritee in Afrike,

Nestorius, bishop of Constantinople, endeavored to bring into the church a
new heresy:

Aetius, the Roman, recovered the part of Gallia liyng about the river Rhine.

The frenchemen subdued Orliaunce and Paris, with much of the country annexed
thereto.

men.xix. years, after many victorious deeds, he dyed.

Gensericus, king of the Ale^es and Uandales in Afrike, besieged the cite
Hippone, where saint Augustine being bishop in the third month of that
siege, ended his life.

The Scotts and Pictes yet ones again entered the la^d of Britain, and spoiled
the country, and chased the commons so cruelly, that they were altogether
comfortless and brought to such misery, that each robbed and spoiled other,
and over this the ground was untilled: whereof ensued great scarcitee and
hungre:, and after hungre death. In this necessitee they sent for aid to
Aetius the Roman captain, being then occupied in wars in a part of
France.

Here ends finally the dominion and tribute of the Romans over this land
of Britain, which had continued the space of.483. years, from that time that
Brutus began to rule this land.1541. and after the city of Rome was builded a
thousand five hundred eyghtie and five.

The end of the first book.
The prologue to the second book.
HItherto we have compediouslye noted the gestes and acts of Britons, and
their princes, while the land was subject and tributarie to the Romans For
the more credit annexing, always the histories of the Romans, and other
external realms in which was done any thing worthy memory: Menglinge also
the most notable things, perteining to christ's church and our faith. In
which (as nere as my simple wit and learning could compass) I have
diligently observed the continual course and order of the histories of every
country, whose acts be in this work touched: that according to my first
promise, the diligent reader may be hold as in a mirror or glass, the state
and condition at all times, not only of England, but also of Italy, France,
Spain, and other parts of the world. After which sort, (god willing) I
purpose to go foreward, in the part following, concerning this realm of
England, is chiefelye to be marked, how the Saxones, after they first entered
this land, by crafty means augmented their rule and dominion, until at length
they chased the Britons, and by force of arms drove them all together out of
their country and for that they were named Angli, called this Island after them
Anglia, which was divided a certain of time into.7. kingdoms, and after
reduced to one monarchye by Aluredus king of west Saxones, here also ye may
note, the increase of the kingdom of France, and the great ruin and decay of
that most flourishinge and victoryous empire of Rome. Which in puisaunce so
far surmounted all other monarchies and kingdoms: as the fierce Lion in
might and courage does pass the other common beasts which
(notwithstanding) was so over run of the barbarous people in those later
days, that the city of Rome, which.700. years had continued as lady and
empress of the world, within the space of.100. year, was four times taken
and most cruelly spoiled, with all the country of Italy, to the manifest
example, that nothing in this world is of such strength and power, that it may
always continue and endure. But let us return to our purpose.

The second book.
THEN IT FOLLOWS:

A synod of.200. bishops was assembled at Ephesus, in the which Nestorius and
Pelagian were condemned.



The dominion of the frenchmen was increased so much,

The Uandales were made friends, with the Romans, and had inhabitaunce given
to them in Affrike.

Aetius, the Roman, overcame Gundicarus king of Burgoyne, and at his instant
prayer made peace.





Gensericus king of the Uandales and Aleines endeuoiring to sow the heresy of
Atrius in Afrike, did persecute the catholic bishops, and most cruelly put
many of them to death.



The Romans by the help of the Hunnes, fought luckyly against the Goths in
France.



Gensericus king of the Uandales, by deceyt took and spoiled Carthage, and
subdued it to his domynion.585. years after it was conquered of the Romans,
and made a part or province of the empire. And thus began Afrike to be subject
to the Uandales.



In the court of Constantine, king of Britain, was a certain Picte, in so
great favor and auctoritee, with the king, that he might at al times come to
his presence who watching his time by secret mean traiterouslye slew the
king in his chamber.

THan Constantius his eldest son, which for his dulle and simple wit,

Peace was made between the Uandales in Afrike and the Romans and certain
limittes and bounds prescribed for the marches of both their lordshippes.

The Hunnes, falling at distance with the Romans, spoiled and ouerrunne
Thracia and Illiria, and by force subdued all the countries, even to the
mountains of Greece, called Thermopile.

Attila, king of the Hunnes, slew his brother Bletas, and enforced the people
to be subject unto him: whereby he obtained the kingedome alone, that before
was divided into two parts.

Congalius, the son of king Dongarde, was ordained king of Scotland after
the death of Constantine. He was given to peace, quietness, and justice, and was
a good and moderate prince.



Constans, king of Britain, was slain of certain Pictes or Scotts, whom
Uortiger had ordained for a guard to the kings body. Whereof when Uortiger had
knowlage, he wept and made semblat of great sorrow, and heaviness, and caused
the said Scotts or Pictes to be put to death, though he in deed was the
chief causer of their treason and murder.

Aurelius and Uter, the kings younger brethren, fled into little Britain.







Than Uortigier, being sore abashed, for so much as he knew the minds of his
people to be alienated from him (after some men's opinion) sent for the Saxones
named Angli, which had no place to dwell in: and gave to them inhabitance in
Kent. By their healp and manhod. in many battles he vanquished and drove back
the Pictes and other enemies: and therefore had them ever after in great love
and favor.

Meroneus was ordained king of France, the which was strong and marciall in all his deeds, and there unto right profitable to the realm. He was present in
the battle against Attila the Hunne, where he with his knights rought
manfully. Of this Mereoneus descended all the kings of the frenchemen, til the
time of Pypyn, father unto Charles the great. In his time Gallia was first
called France.

The Synod Chalcedonense was assembled, where were present.vi. hundred
bishops, which condemned Eutices and Dyoscorus, notable and famous heretics.



At that time Actius, master of the Roman chiualry, was still in a part of
France, and had made peace with the Goths, the frenchemen, and other: to the
entente that they, ioygninge together their puisance, might resist the power
of the tyran. Attila, who in this pastyme, had sent to Theodorich, king of the
Goths, wyllyng him to forsake the Romans, and favor his party, but
Theodorich would in no wise be confederate with that Pagane, and Barbarous
tyranne.



Histories do testify, that there was never so great a multitude gathered in
the weast parts: with the Romans were the frenchemen, Burgonions, Goths, and
all the weaste parts: with Attila the Sueues, Herules, Turinges, all the
people of Scythia, and the north parts. The battle continued from the son
rising to the euentyde: and than was Attyla of his ennem^es put to the worse,
and lost of his men.180000. and was brought in to such a streighte, that he
would have slain him self.

Theodorich, king of the wisig oaths, in this conflicte was slain. Wherefore
Turismunde his son, to revenge his fathers death, would have pursued Attila,
and utterly vanquisshed his whole power. Which thing undoubtedly he had
brought to pass, had not Aetius the Roman changed his mind, who feared,
if he had subdued Attila, that he with his Goths being inflate with so great
a victory, would have broke league and turned his power upon the Roman empire.

But this counsel of Aetius was evil. For Attila, by this mean having
leisure returned into Hungary,

Than was Leo Pope sent to desire of him peace: which, contrary to the
exspectacion of all men, he obtained, on this condition, that Rome should be
to him tributarie.

Attila, after league made with the Romans, required Honoria, life in the
mids of his festinges, whereby it chanced, that whom the power of the whole
empire could not resyst, a cup of wine utterly vanquisshed.

From that time that the Roman empire began first to decaie, to this year,
the Romans had lost all Germany, Dacia, Sarmatia* and other provinces liyng
nere the river Dunake and Rhine: also a great part of Spain and most part of
France, with Britain: of the which none were after recovered to the Romans.

Hengist, one of the leaders of the Saxones, found means,

Uenece, the famous city, was first founded of them, which fearinge the
crueltee of Attila, fled from the country about Aquileia into those Islands
where now Ue^^ce stands.

Ualentinian, the emperor, enuiyng, or rather fearing the prosperitee of
Aetius his Duke, commanded him to be put to death: and after demanded of his
familiars, whether it were not well done. To whom they said* that the deed
would shortly declare it self: but yet in the mean time, that he had with
his left hand cut of his right: meaning, that Aetius had been of long time
the stay of the empire.

There happened contencion between the sons of Attila, for the succession of
the kyngedome* whereby they shortly lost all that their father had lost them.
For the Gepydes, with their king Ardarius, making sodeine war upon them,
discoumfited their host, and scatered them with their people into diverse
countries. After which example many other nations forsook their dominion, and
refused to be subject unto them.

Riciarins, king of Suitzers, inuading Spain, was chased and driven back.

Ualentinian the emperor, was slain of Thrasila, one of the soldiers of
Actius,

Maximus after him invaded the imperial crown, and when he had reigned two
months was slain.

Gensericus, king of Uandales in Afrike* by the intiseme^t of Eudoxia the
empress, with a mighty army invaded Rome and took the city. But by the
intercession of Leo, being than bishop, he abstreigned from slaughter and
taking with him all the riches of Italye, returned again into Afrike. This
happened.43. years after the city was first taken by the Goths.

After this time the maiestee of the Romain emperors was utterly decayed. For
most vile and unworthy persons, of no nobleness or virtue, invaded the
imperial crown, and usurped the same at their will and pleasures.

Panlinus bishop of Nola, a city in Italy, gave all his substance for the
redemption of his citisins, which were ladde away as prisoners of the
barbarous people And finally committed his own body to prisone, for the
delyueraunce of one poor widows son*

Auitus took on him imperial auctoritee in France and at Placentia,

Martianus, emperor of the east,

Maiorianus took on him the governance of the empire of Rome and the west, and
reigned.v. years.

the incursions of all enemies. For the which service the Britaynes should
give to them competent meat and wages. And under this pretense caused more
Saxones to be sent for, entendinge at convenient time, by force to have the
land in their subjection.





The Britains considering the daily repair of the Saxones into this realm,
showed to their king the ieopardie that might thereof ensue, and advertised him
to avoid the danger, and expel them out of the realm. But al was in vayn.
For Uertiger by reason of his wife bore such favor toward the Saxones, that
he would in no wise hear the counsayl of his subjects. Wherefore they with
one will and mind, deprived him of his roial dignitee,

Seuerus, by confederacy of certain Romans, was advanced to the imperial
auctoritee in place of Maiorianus, and reigned.iiii. years.

This Uortimer (as before is said) being made king in a ll have he pursued the
Saxones,







emperor, was banished by Anthemius.

Childericus was again restored to his regalitee in France: and soon after
subdued a Saxon prince named Onager, and conquered the cite of Orliance: and
passing over the river of Leyr, subdued to his signorie the country of Angeo
and Maine.

VOrtigier obtained again the kyngedome of great Britain,



Asper likewise at Constantinople laid privy wait to slay the emperor Leo,

After the Barbarous people had disturbed the whole world with deadly and
cruel wars, and infected all the weast parts (specially Italye) with most
habominable vices and all kind of naughty living, true learning religion and
godliness greatly decayed among Christian men, and covetousness, arrogancy,
a desire of worldly pomp reigned not only in the hertes of princes and the
common people, but also especially of bishops and prelates of the church:
so that a little before this time John the patriarch of Constantinople, of an
intolerable pride, made suite to Mauritius the emperor to be called the
chief bishop, whom Gregory than bishop of Rome vehemently withstode, and
wrate against him very extremely in diverse epistles: saying, that he first
brought in the example of Antichrist into the church, for that he claimed to
him the name of an universal bishop, to the derogacion of al other, with
diverse like words of great reproach. Upon that occasion given by John bishop
of Constantinople, Boniface being now at this time made bishop of Rome,
obtained of Phocas the emperor, to be called the universal and chief bishop,
nothing regarding either the commandment and instruction of Christ, sayyng to
his disciples, that they which would be highest among them, should be lowest:
either else the example of godly men before time, and decrees of ancient
counsels which did always abhor that such titles and names of extreme
pride, should be used in the church. For saint Cyprian writing often to
Cornelius bishop of Rome, never calls him otherwise than brother, or fellow
bishop* the like is found in the works of Tertullian, Hierome Chrysostom,
Augustine, and other ancient writers* yea and the counsel of Carthage hold
in the year of our lord 419. (where, 217. bishops were present) because the
auctoritee of the bishop of Rome was sumwhat than in controversy decreed, that
none should be called the chief bishop but only in this wise the bishop of the
chief see, which honor they gave than to Rome, because it was and had been
the seat royal of the empire: not to establyshe any auctoritee over other
churches: these things I say nothing regarded. Boniface began first to
usurp that primacie, that the Romain bishops have ever sense, falsely alleged
to be given them by the scripture above other bishops. Wherefore, seeing that
Gregory esteemed John of Constantinople to bring into the church the example of
Antichrist, because he sued for the name of universal bishop: every man may
easelye judge, what is to be thought of all the successoures of Gregorye in
the sea of Rome, which have not only take upon them that name to the
derogacion of all other bishops, as Gregory complains, but also to be called
the head of the universal church, christ's vicar in earth, with other names
and cities of blaspgemy, to the great dishonor of god: callengyng also and
usurping, (under this pretense a full jurisdiction and auctoritee not only
over the whole clergy, but also over emperors, kings, and princes of the
world, alteringe and disposing their realms and kingdoms at their own
pleasure, by ree^ing of most deadlye wars to the utter disturbance of all
Christendom. Yea and that is most intolerable, auauntinge them self in
their decrees to have auctoritee above the word of god, and that the
interpretacion thereof was only in their hands: because (as they say, they
could not err, and yet by their errors and diuelishe ordinances have brought
into the church all naughty doctrine, supersticion, and deprauing of gods
word, when rby they have well nere utterly banished true religion and showed
them self to be the chief head and membre of Antechrist.

The French king prepared greatly for the wars, fortifiyng all parts of his

revenged, priuilye ass^^^led a strong army, purposyng to take Carl^le, and
destroy all the weast Marches, which he thought to be but w^ake, because all
the power and provision of the Englisshem^n lay in the east marches about
Barwyke. Therefore he sent the lord Maxwell, warden of his weast marches who
knew the country well, with the Earls of Cassiles and Glencarn, and diverse of
his priuye chamber to conducte this army. But by the prowes and wisdom of
sir Thomas Warton and sir Wyllyam Mu^graue, with a right few of the borderers,

encamped before Bulleyne on the eas^ side. The.xiiii. day of July king Henry
him self, with a goo^ly company passed from Dover to Caleys, and on the xxvi.
day of the same month, encamped on the north side of Bulleyne. After whose
coming the town was so sore battered with gunshotte, and certain of their
tow^rs being undermined, so shaken with force of gunnepouder, that after a
months siege, the captain sent word to the king, that he would yield the
town to his behalf, on condition that all which were within, might depart
with bag and baggage, which condition king Henry mercyfully granted. And

leaving behind him his ordinance, tents, and plate.

The.xix. day of Februarye was cruelly bourned at Torney in the frontiers of
France, in Arg^ntine, a city in Germany. The manner of his death was this, he
was burned with a small fire, to the end to make his tourment the greater. He
stood manfully to his doctrine even to the last breath, and being in prison he
did by letters confirm his disciples, and confort his wife and children even
after he was cond^^n^d to die. The doctrine that he stood to in his last
examination consists in these points. First, that in the supper of the Lord
duly ministered and received: is in spirit by faith received the very body
of Christ. That the mass is a mere man's invention iniur ious to Christ. That
the worshippyng of the consecrated bre ade, is ydolatrie. That there is none
other purgatory but Christ's blood. That we can not honor saints better*
then by following them in faith and virtue. That man's frewill is so let by
the fall of Adam, that* without gods grace it can do no good thing. That it
is faith which brings us salvation. That no man's traditions ought to be
received to bind conscience. That to have images in temples, is very
dangerous, for falling into ydolatrie. That baptism is the sign of the
covenant that God has made with us, and of the mortifications and new life
that should follow baptism, and that this sacrament ought not to be denied to
infantes, sith the promise pertayneth to them also. That no vow ought to be
made more then the word of god requires, or that is not in man's power to
perform. That eareshrift, other then for counsel in doubtful matters, is a
very dangerous tormentyng of the mind. And that he did not doubt of the
perpetual virginity of the virgin Mary.

The Somer after, the Frenchmen came down with a great power, and builded the
fort or bastilion, over against Boloigne, which the french king named
Monpleasure, between which fort and the town of Boloigne, were continual
skirmishes, to the loss of both parts.

Word came to king Henry yt the frenchmen intended to la^d in the Isle of Wight.
Wherefore he went to Por^ismouth, and sent letters into diverse parts of his
^^alm, to have me^ in a redines. At which his being there, a goodly ship of ye
kings named Mary rose with sir George ^arew the capitain, and many other
^^ntilmen was drowned in the mids o^ the haven b^ ^r^at folly and negligence.

Lisle hy^h (...) all with a company of.7000. men, to pr^u^nt (...), who
intended to build an other forte at (...) ^ode, At which time they entr^d
into the haven two ^ay^ before the frenchemen had appointed to b^ there. An^ so
(...) seated them of their purpose.

Often skirmishes between the English garr^son of Bulleyn and the French
forte, greatly to the loss of both parts. And at one tym^ especially were
slain.xvi. english gentle men* and.lxxx. other, and few or none of the
Frenchemenne.

down in all parts of the realm, as places that did maintain whordom,

THe most gratiouse and noble prince Edward the s^xt being.ix. years of age,

Under this King, in the the time of his minoritye, his uncle Edward Duke of
Somerset, Lord protector, with the rest of the counsel, governed this realm.

were sent into al parts of the realm with commandment to take all Images
out of churches, for auoydinge of Idolatry, and to cause al persons to leave
the superstitiouse use of beads. With these commissioners were sent certain
godly learned preachers which dehorted men from superstition, and enstructed

mind, with due obedience toward their prince.

This year order was taken that the pompous and superstitious manner of going in
processi^n should be left, and no more used.

The last day of July, Steven Gardener Bisshoppe of Winchester was sent
prisoner to the tower of London.

And about the same time, Doctor Smith of Oxford recanted openly at paul's
cross, diverse articles contained in two books which he had made: one for
the defense of the sacrifice of the Maise, an other to prove that unwritten
verities ought to be believed under pain of damnation.

Shortly after, the Lord Protectoure and Earl of Warwike, went into
Scotland with a strong army requiringe the Scotts to fulfill their promise
made before to king Henry, concerning the marriage of their young Queen with
noble prince Edward his son. But the Scotts always unfaithful of
promise, stubb^rnel^e came against them with a great puisaunce. And not long
after, the two armies encou^tred in the feldes of Muscleborow^ at a place
called Pinkersloughe, the englishmen not thinckynge as then to have battle.
And because the front of the Scottishe army was so terribly set with pikes,
our horsemen that gave the first on set, were enforced to recule, with loss
of certain gentlemen, which reculynge much abashed our footmen. But yet, by
the great wisdom and pollicye of the capitaynes, and the good stomach of our
soldiers, wherewith god had at that present strengthed them: they gave a new
onset, and without any notable fight discomfited the Scotts and optayned a
noble victory. At this time were slain of the Scotts between thyrtene and
fouretene thousand, and not passing an hundred Englysshemen.

This year did the pestilence so rage in the City of London, that men fell to

order was appointed for the auoidyng of sturdy vagabundes and beggars.

In this mean while, Peter Martyr, a Florentine borne, and of excellent
knowledge in divinity, being sent for by Thomas Cranmer archebyshop of
Canterbury: came into England* in November, and shortly after was made reader
of divinity in the university of O^forde for his excellency and soundenes in
doctrine.

Also in this parliament were repealed certain bloody statutes made in the time
of king Henry the eight,

The fifte day of Februarye, the above named duke of Somerset, with the rest
of the counsaylours of the realm, did write unto the Scotts in the kings
name, a very long and piththy Oration, exhorting them to embrace peace, but
in vain, as afterward appeared, to the great loss of both realms.

In this February hot persecution began again in France, and especially
at Paryse, for the doctrine of Martyn Luthere, where as in the mean while, in
England, men's wits were occupied in dyuysynge how to abolyshe the mass
utterly.

In Aprile following, Martine Bucer, being sent for by the marquis of
Brandenborough one of the princis electours, came from Strawsborough in
Germany to Aus^orough, and was there of him and other at his appoyntemente,
entreated and persuaded, by fair words and promyses, by roughe words and
threatenynges, and by all means possible, to give his consent to a book
called Antididagma, which the Papists had been in hand with, from the year
of our Lord, a thousand five hundred fortye and two, to this present^ year
a.1548, and had as now made it perfect as they thought: But all this not
withstanding Bucer departed, not geuyng consent to their book, but not without
danger of his life. This book was first pende against that book of reformation
of religion which Herman bishop of Coleyn caused to be drawn, and was
afterward set forth in his name. But yet when they had made it as perfect
as they could, and had confirmed in it all popery, welmoste it could not be
allowed by Gods vicar of Rome, because there were in it some things granted
to the contrary part.

The first day of October Edmunde Boner bishop of London was deprived of his
byshoprike, and put in prison in the Marshalsey, for that he obstinately stood
in the defense of popisshe supersticion, and Nycholas Ridley bishop of
Rochester, was by the kings authority transl^t^d to London.

The fourth day of November was a parliament holden at Westminster upon
prorogation, wherein was authorized a book of an uniform order of common prayer
and administration of the sacraments in the english tongue.

Also the marriage of priests was in the same parliament made laufull.

Moreover the act made in the.xxxii. of the reign of king Henry the eight
concerning contractes of matrimony, was in this parliament repealed, for that
many beastly persons, maliciousely enterpreting the same, did by obtaynyng the
first carnal copulation, take from honest men their despoused wives.

Sir Thomas Seimour lord Seimour of Sudley high admyrall of England,

In Aprile, Martine Bucer and Paulus Fagius, men of excellent learning, after
many letters sent to them from Thomas Cranmer archbishop of Cantorburye, came
into England, and were friendly received of the king himself, of the whole
nobility welmoste, and of the people also. And after they had a while
refreshed the^ selves with the archebyshop of Canterbury, they were both sent
to Cambri^ge, there to teach the true doctrine of Christ.

In May following Peter Martyr and the divines of Oxforde, disputed openly of
the Lords supper and the presence of Christ therein. These questions did
Peter Martyr propone and defend. That the substance of bread and wine is not
changed, and that the body and blood of Christ is not carnally and corporally
in the bread and wine, but is sacramentally united or knitte thereunto. The
report of this disputation was afterward setforth in print, wherein the
moderatours of the disputations appointed by the king, do plainly declare,
that Martyr had the upper hand.

In June following, the French king came to Paris, with great pomp, and this
was the first coming of him thither after the death of his father, where at
his being there, and in his presence, as some think, many were put to death
for Luthers doctrine. And the king, as it appeared by a writing then set forth
in printe, and sent into all parts of France, was there professed an open
enemy to that sort of men, determynyng to root them quite out of his
dominions. And not long after, he cut of mounsier Ueruines head, for that he
had surrendered Boloigne to king Henry the eight, after a long siege and sore
battrie and assaults.

About this time, there began in England great sedition among the people in all
parts, but chiefly in Norfolk and in Devonshire. The chief captain in
Devonshire was sir John Arundell a knight, and in Norfolk one Kite a tanner.
These both required grounds lately enpastured and enparked to be laid open
again, but the chief cause of their rebellion was to have the popish mass and
ceremonies restored. They wronghte much by a blind prophecy, which told
them that they should mete at London. And in deed so they did, for they were
brought prisoners thither in one day, and committed to the tower. Such is the
good success that they have which follow blind prophecies.

In this mean while did the french king invade and win the forte which king
Henry had builded beetwene Boloigne and Calice, called Newhauen, the loss
whereof was laid to the Duke of Somersettes charge, for that he being
protector had not seen that piece better furnished. And in conclusion John
Dudley the Earl of Warwyke with the assent and help of others, counselors
and nobles of the re^lme, charged him in open proclamation of misgouernement*
and caused him to be apprehended at Wyndsore, whether he was fled with the
young ^ynge his neuewe, from whens he was brought as a traitor to the tower of
London.

The fowerth day of November a parlyment was holden at Westminster upon
prorogation, and there continued and kept to the first day of February,
wherein was made an act for the punishment of such as would unlawfully
assemble them selves. Also an act for the restitution of blood in sir William
Sheryngton knight, and an other for Mary daughter to sir Thomas Seimor high
Admyral.

In this mean while, Paulus Fagius dyed at Cambridge about the end of
November,

In the beginning of February, the bishop of Strausborowe had brought his
matters to pass, and made perfect his ministers, and began solemnly in.iii.
churches of the City, which the Senate had permitted him to occupy, the
Popish manner of their gods service, to the great admiration of youth, which
had seen no such monstrous mummeries before.

A littell before this, Arundell who was captain to the Devonshire men was
hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburne. This was done the.xxvi. of Ianuarye.
And about the ^ame time, Ky^^ captain of the rebels in Norfolk was with
his brother condemned and sent to be hanged in chains at Norwiche.

Before this, the.xix. day of the same month, were mu^dred without Newgate in
London one Gambo and a^ other Filicirga, capitaynes of the Spanyardes, that had
served in the wars at Boloigne, and else where. This murder was done by one
Charles Gauaro a Flemyng borne, who for the same deed had his hand cut of in
the place where he did it, and was with his three men hanged in Smithfielde
upon Saint Paul's even then next following. He came post from Barwik to London,
to do this murder, and at his death said he would never repent it.

The.vi. day of February, the duke of Somerset was delivered out of the tower.

The same month went out of England certain lords of the counsel to
Boloigne, where certain of the french counsel met with them, where at the
last they concluded a peace, which was proclaimed the.xxix. day of March
following. And about the.xxv. of Aprille, the town of Boloigne with the
fortresses thereunto belongyng, was delivered by the Englyshemen into the hands
of the Frenchemen.

The second day of May was brent in Smithfielde a woman called Ione Knel,
otherwise called Ione Boucher, for the horrible heresy, that Christ took no
flesh of the virgin Mary. And at her death did preach one master John
Scory, then preacher at Canterbury.

About this time there were certain light persons that pretended a new
commotion in Kent, but they were apprehended, and the.xiii. of May was hanged
at Ashforde in Kent Rychard Lion, and G^ddard Goram and the next day following
was hanged at Canterbury Rychard Ireland for the same purpose.

In this mean while, the Englyshemen, and many others which favored the
gospel in the low countries of Germany, were sore amassed, by reason of an
Edict that Charles the Emperor set forth against the Lutherans, and all their
favorers, and such as should be found with their books or images, made to
the dishonor of any of the popes holy saints.



The.xiiii. day of February was committed a shame full murder at Feuersham in
Kent. One Arden, a gentylmanne, was by the consent of his own wife murdered,
wherefore she was brent at Canterbury, two hanged in chains at Feuersham, and a
woman brent: And in Smithfielde was hanged one Mos by and his sister. And the
ruffian that was by the wife hired to do the deed, whose name was black
Willyam, fled into Sealande, and was taken at Flushyng, and there burned on a
scaffolde besides the haven.

The.xvi. day of the same month, Steven Gardener, bishop of Wynchester, was
deprived of his bishoprike, and so committed to the tower again, where he lay
during the life of king Edward. Into whose place was by the kings authority
translated, doctor Poynet, bishop of Rochester.

The.xxviii. of this month dyed at Cambridge Martine Bucer, and was there
honorably buried, and commended by the Epitaphes of many learned men, among
whom were the two sons of Charles duke of Suffolk, whose mother being a
great favorer of pure religion, showed great kyndnes and frendshyp to Bucer,
both before and in his sickness. He died of the hickocks

The.xxv. of May there was an earthquake in Sotherie, and in part of
Middelsex.

About the same time there was a dutcheman burned in Smithfielde for holdyng
the opinion of the Arrians.

At this season there fell among the english nation, a very dangerous
sweat, both in the realm, and in strange countries, insomuche that many died
in very short space. And much fruit of the repentance of former life
appeared sodeynely. For some abated their unreasonable rentes, and many sought
for the poor and nedy in prisons, and else where, to relie^^ them. But so soon
as the sweat was ceased, they fell to their wonted sins again, and as it
seemed, repented them of their former repentance.

In July the piece that was coigned for.xii. d. was by proclamation abated
to.ix. d. and the piece of.iiij. d. to.iij. d. And in August after from.ix. d.
to.vi. d. and from.iij. d. to.ij. d. And the piece of.ij. d. to a penye, and
the penny to an halfepeny.

In October, the duke of Somerset was again appreapprehended, and committed to
the tower, and with him sir Michel Stanhop, sir Rafe Fane, sir Miles Partriche,
and other. For then was John Earl of Warwyke, mde duke of Northumberlande,
whose death he said, the duke of Somerset had conspired.

The second day of November the old Queen of scotts came to London, who was
honorably re^^yued, and lodged in the bishops palaice.

Shortly after the Duke of Somerset was arrayned at Westminster, and by his
pieres acquit of Treason, but condemned of felony, and so committed to the
tower again, where he remained till he was brought forth to his death.

In this mean while, the young King was entised to pass time in maskeyng
and mumminge. And to that end there was piked out a sort of misrulers to
deuyse strange spectacles in the court, in the time of Christmas to cause the
young king to forgette, yea rather to hate, his good uncle, who had purged the
court of all such outrage, and enured the king unto the exercise of
virtuous learning, and hearing of sermons. This was the high way, first to
make an end of the kings uncle, and after of the king himself.

The.xiii. day of Ianuarye, the sea brake in at Sandewitche,

The.xxiij. of this monethe Edward duke of Somerset was beheaded at the tower
hill in London, where at the time of his speaking to the people, there fell
such a sudden fear among the people by reason of a rumoure that ran abroad
of the duke of Northumberla^des power of horsemen to be in a readiness about
the City, and an horse man that came in hastilye at the north side of the
tower hill that they fell to shufflynge and thrustynge, as men that stood in
danger of their lives. In so much that of all the great number of the guard
and other, that stood there with weapons to se execution done, there was not one
left in his order about the s^ffolde. In this stir many were trodden under
foot, and many thrust into the tower dytche. At the last whenne the people
perceived that there came no mo horsemenne, they supposed that he that was
comen, had brought a pardon for the Duke, and therefore they began to shoute
and cast up their cappes. Which thing when the duke perceived, he beckened
with his cappe in his hand for silence. And that obtained, he wylled the
people to quiet them selves, to obey the rulers, and to love their young
king, and to pray to god for him, that he might long live and reign over
them. As for him self, he looked for no pardon, other then at Gods hand. And
so he prepared him self to the axe, wherein he behaved himself so soberly and
humbly, that none so hard herted about him, that did not shed tears.

The.xxv. day of February, there we^e hanged at the tower hill for the dukes
matter, sir Rafe Fane, and sir Miles Partriche knights, and sir Thomas
Arundell, and sir Myghell Stanhope beheaded.

The summer following, the king went in progress into the weste countreye,
wherein his young affections were fed by them that were about him, not
without great danger of his life, by outrageous ridyng in haukyng and
huntyng. Toward winter he returned to London, and from thens he went to
Grenewich, where was prepared matter of pastyme, a fort counterfaited, riding at
the tylte, and goodly pastimes at Christmas, till the king had gotten a cough
that brought him to his end.

The first day of March was holden a parliament at Westmynster,

In this mean while there were three noble ships furnyshed for the great
adventure of the unknown viage into the east by the northseas. The great
encourager of this voyage was Sebastian Gaboto, an englisheman, borne at
Bristow, but a Genoways son. These shyp^ did shortly after pass galla^tly by
Grenewiche in the kings presence, one of the maryners standing upon the main
topmaste of one of them.

At the same time there were other like ships set forth toward the
southe to seek adventures.

All this mean while king Edward was sick, And his councillors linckinge
them selves by maryages. And much talk there was that the king was poisoned,
and some suffered imprisonment and punishments for so saying, and also for
saying that he was dead. In fine, the tenthe day of July, it was by
proclamation declared in London, that he dyed the.vi. day of that month. And
at the same time, there was a prayer setforth in printe, under the testimonye
of sir Thomas Wroth, one of the privy chaumber, and doctoure Owen one of the
kings physicians, with others: wherein the king a little before he departed,
besought God to preserve this realm from popery.

In the abouenamed proclamation which was set forth by the consent of the
duke of Northhumberlande and all the learned counsel of this realm, very few
excepted, among whom Justice Hales of Kent was one, and of the Mayre and
Aldermen and common counsel of the City of London, and most part of the
Nobility, lady Jane, daughter unto Henry Duke of Suffolk was proclaimed
Queen, contrary to that order that was taken in parliamente for the
succession of the Crown in the later day of king Henry the eight, pretendynge
the fear of that which followed in deed, that if Mary should reign, she would
bring in foren power and the bishop of Rome.

But God, who will not have his truth mayntayned by puttyng heirs from their
right: confounded their wisdom. And by that woman who^ they would have shuldred
from her right, he punished their insatiable gatherynge of tresure under their
good king. For he so turned the hertes of the people to her and against them,
that the ouercam them without bloodshed, not withstandinge there was made great
expedition against her both by sea and land.

For when the counsel at London perceived that the common people would not
stand with them, and that certain noble men began to go the other way: they
turned their tale, and proclaimed the lady Mary, eldest daughter to king Henry,
and appointed by parliament to succeed Edward, dyeng without issue. And so the
Duke of Northhumberlande being by the whole counsel sent fo^the against her,
was left alone at Cambridge with some of his sons, and a few other, among
whom the Earl of Huntyngton was one, who was there arested, and brought to the
tower of London as traitors to the Crown.

In this mean while, the lady Jane and her husband Gylforde, son to the duke
of Northhumberland, were made prisoners in the tower, where they had lain from
the time of her proclamation.

Queen Mary.
THus did Mary the first begin her reign over this Realm, the.xx. of July,
in the year of our Lord.1553. being at Framyngham cast^ll in Suffolk.

The.iij. of Auguste she came to London, and entered the tower, where she found
prisoners Thomas duke of Norfolk, Stephen Gardener bishop of Winchester,
Cuthbert Tonstall bishop of Durham, and Edward Courtney. And al these she
restored shortly after, to their former dignities, and some of them to
greater, as Stephen Gardener whom she made Chauncelloure, and Courtney Earl of
Deuonshyre, notwithstanding they were before laufully deprived.

Shortly after, she restored Edmonde Boner of London, doctor Day of
Chichester, Heath of Worcester, and Troublefield of Excester, putting out
Ridley, Scorye, Houper, and Couerdale. She put also out of Wynchester Poynet,
out of York, the archebyshop, out of Bathe, Barlowe, out of Lyncolne Taylour,
out of Harforde Harley, out of saint David's, Farrar, and from Cantorbury the
arch^bysshop Cranmer. And besides these many ^eanes, as May, deane of Poules,
Turner deane of Wells, Horn deane of Durham, H^ddon, deane of Exceter, with
other many. And in a sum, al all m aried mi^^sters, that would not forsake
(...) ^^ues a nd do penance, receyuynge the popes absol^cion, and promise to
become true papists. But such as r^^us^d not so to do, though they were removed
from their places to satisfy the holy fathers law, yet in short (...) after
they were placed else where, in as much or more w^l^h then ever they were before.

All this was not done in the time of her first being in the tower, but so
shortly after as possibly it might be.

Shortly after her coming to the tower the bisshoppe of London being restored,
appointed master Bowrne, a cannon of Poules, to preach at the cross, who
taking occasion of the gospel of the day to speak somewhat largelye in
iustifienge of Boner the bisshoppe then present, who preached upon the same
text in that place that day four years, and was upon the same most cruelly
and unjustly (as he said) cast into the most v isle dungion of the
Martials^e, and there kept duringe the time of king Edward: his words sowned
so evil in the ears of the hearers, that they could not keep silence, but
began to murmr and stir in such sort, that the Maire and Aldermen with
other estates then present, feared much an uproar. And some said, that one
hurled a dagger at the preacher, but that could not be proved. In fine the
stur was such, that the preacher withdrewe him self from the place. And
master John Bradford ^at the request of the prechers brother and other, then
being in the pulpit) stood forth and spoke so mildly Christianly and
effectuously, that with few words he appeased all. And afterward he and John
Rogers conducted the preacher betwyxt them, from the pulpit to the grammar
schole dor^ where they left him safe. But shortly after they were both
rewarded with long imprisonment, and last of all with fire in Smithfielde.

The next sunday following, the queen's guard were at the cross with their
weapons to guard the precher. And when quiet men withdrewe themselves from
the sermon, order was taken by the mayre, that the auncientes of all companies
should be present, least the preacher should be discouraged by his small
auditorie.

The.xxii. of August the duke of Northhumberlande, sir John Gates knight, and
sir Thomas Palmer, were beheaded at the tower hyl, where the said duke trusting
to r^ceiue pardon (as some thought) or else given over to himself, as commonly
such men be as walk without the fear of God, confessed that he had lived
in error many years, and ^xhorted the people to embrace the popish religion,
which he termed Catholic. But sir Thomas Palmer, who had led a life no less
dissolute, protested that he dyed in the faith that he had learned in the
gospel, and lamented that he had not lived more gospellyke. Here we see two
in one condemnation, the one received, and the other refused, so far as man
can se.

About the fyft day of September, Peter martyr came to London from Oxforde,
where for a time he had been commanded to keep his house, and found there the
archebyshop of Canturbury, who offered to defend the doctrine of the book of
Common prayer, both by the scriptures and doctors,

In this time doctor Marten of the new college in Oxforde, was pennyng a
book against the marriage of priests, which when it was finished by the help
of Nicholas Udall: was so lyked of the queen and the Lord chancellor, that
doctor Marten had a commission to make free denizens of French and dutche
men, which he executed in the spring following, and made his self a
gentilman, and set forth his book in print. But shortly after he was by
doctor ponet, answered at the full

The last day of September the Queen passed through the City of London to
Westminster with great pomp And among other strange sightes there set forth,
this was most to be had in memory. A man stood upon the back of the
we^hercocke of Paul's steple, without stay, having a streamer in his hand.
On the morrow she was crowned at westminster, Stephen Gardener being minister.

The.x. day of October, began a parliament, wherein were repealed al statutes
m^de in the time of King Henry theight for praemunire and statutes made in king
Edward the syx^ time for administration of common prayer and the sacraments
in the English tongue. And further thattaynder of John Duke of Northumberlande
was by this parlyamente confyrmed. In this mean while many men were forward in
the erectyng of Altars and masses in Churches. And such as would stycke to
the laws made in King Edwardes time till other should be established: were
some of them marked and some presently apprehended, among whom Sir James
Hales a knight of Kent, and justice of the common place was one. Who not
withstandinge he had ventred his life in queen Mary's cause, in that he would
not subscribe to the disheritinge of her by the kings will, yet for that he
did at a quarter sessions give charge upon the statutes made in ye time of
Henry theight and Edward the vi. for supremacy and Religion, he was imprisoned
in the Martialsy Counter and Flete, and so cruelly handled, and so put in fear
by talk yt the ward of the Flete used to have in his hering, of torments that
were in preparing for heretics, that he sought to rid himself out of this life,
by wou^ding himself with ^ knife. And afterward was content to say as they
willed him where upon he was discharged: But never quieted in conscience, till
he had drowned him self in a river half a mile from his house in Kent.

About the.xviii. of October, there was at Poules church in London a
disputation appointed by ye queen's commandment, about ye presence of Christ in
the sacrament of the altar, as they call it. This disputation continued.vi.
days, wherein doctor Weston was chief on the popes part, who behaved himself
outragiously in tantyng and checking. In conclusion, such as disputed on the
contrary part were driven some to flee, some to deny, and some to dye, though
to the most men's judgments that herd the disputation they had the upper
hand. About thend of October, one Michael Seruetus, a spaniard, was put to
death at Geneua for denying the eternal deity of Christ Jesus. At this time
died James Sturmius at Strawsborow, a man of excellent lerning and virtue, of
the age of.lxiii. years.

In November the archbishop Cranmer (notwithstanding he had earnestly refused
to subscribe to the kings will, in disher^tynge his sister Mary, alledgynge
many and pithy reasons for her legitimation) was in the guild hall of London
arrained and attainte of high treason, with the lady Jane, and three of the
duke of Northhumberlands sons, which al returned to the tower again.

In this mean while, Cardinal Poole being sent for by queen Mary, was by
the Emperor requested to stay with him, to thentent (as some think) that his
presence in England should not be a let to the marriage which he intended
between Philip his son and queen Mary. For the making whereof he sent a most
ample embassage, with full power to make up the marriage betwixt them. Which
took such success, that after they had commoned of the matter a few days,
they knytte up the knotte.

This was done about the beginning of January, and was very evil taken of
the people, brought up to the tower of London. In this mean while Peter Carewe
hearing of that was done, fled into France, but the other were taken, and
Wyat came toward London in the beginning of February, from whence themperors
ambassadors sped themselves away in have al by water. The queen heryng of Wyats
coming came into the city to the Gylde hall, where she made a vehement Oration
against Wyat, declaringe that she neither had nor would consent to mary
otherwise then should seem to the counsel to be for the wealth of the realm.
Wherefore she desired them of the City to stick to her in the suppressing of
rebell^use traitors and desending her royal estate.

This done she appointed the Lord William Haward lieutenant of the City, and
the Earl of Penbroke general of the field. And lest any should escape out of
the city to Wiat, she caused the drawbridge of London to be cut of, and let
fall into the river Temes. In this mean while was Wyat commen into Southwarke,
And after two days there spent in vain: he departed to wards Kyngston, where
he passed the river by force, thinckynge to have comen to London in good time,
but he was disappointed, partly by breaking the carriage of his ordinau^c^ and
par^elye by weariness of the long and foul journey. So that at his coming
to Charing cross he was paste all hope of preuailinge. And yet suffered to go
quietly through the streets to Ludgate, and returning thens was resisted at
Temple bar, and there apprehended.

On the next day proclamation was made, that no man should in pain of death,
keep any of the faction of Wiat in hi^ house, but forthwith bring them out,
notwithstanding that general pardon was by the haralde declared at the
apprehension of Wyat the day before, which was Ashewensedaye.

Then were there gallowses and gibbetes erected in all parts of the City and
suburbs of London to the nombre of.xx. or therabout, and many capitayns and
souldyours of Wyats fac^ion hanged thereon. Which ga^lowses stood styl^ in their
places in the streets till the beginning^ of June following when preparation
began to be m^^e for receyuyng of Philip prince of Spain.

The.xii. day of February was beheded the lady Jane, and her husband Gilforde
Dudley, two innocents in comparison of them that sat in judgment upon them.
For they did but ignorantly accept that which the other had wittingly devised
to take from others to give to them.

The.xxi. of that month was Henry duke of Suffolk beheaded at the tower hill,
being condemned but.iiii. days before.

After this were condemned for this conspiracy many gentilmen and yeomen,
whereof some were executed at London, and some in the country, and in fine the
queen pardoned.iiii. hundredth of the common people.

The.xv. day of March was committed to the toure, Courtney the Earl of
Devonshire, and the.xviii. of the same, the lady Elizabeth sister to the queen,
both upon suspicion of wyats conspiracy.

Shortly after was apprehended in Northwales the lord Thomas Graye, brother
to the duke, and sir James Crofte, which lord Thomas was after executed.

Immediately there was a parliament summoned to be holden at Oxforde, where was
made great preparation to the great hindrance of many of the inhabitants. For
it was afterward appointed to be at Westmynster, and was there holden the
second of April, wherein the queen requested.ii. things, her marriage, and
restoring of the pope the one she obtained upon certain conditions, the other
would not be granted as than.

In this mean while, not only the strangers that were in king Edwardes time,
received into the realm for religion, among whom one John a Lasco uncle to ye
king of Poland was one: but many englismen also fled, some to Friseland, some
to Cleueland, some to high Germany, where they ^ound great favor, but
especially at Frankfort upon Mea^e. And sum went to Geneua, where they found
great favor also. About the same time there were hanged at Chard in
Somersetshire.iii. young men for breakyng and burning of church ornaments.

The.x. day of April, Archebishoppe Cranmer, Bishop Rydley, and Hugh Latimer
went out of the tower toward Oxforde, where they had disputacions with the
deuynes of both universities, and because they would not recant they were
reserved in prisone, till they might be condemned by the popes authority, not
withstanding that they answered most substantially and truly.

At this time was sir Thomas Wyat beheaded at the tower hill, and afterward
quartered, and his quarters set up in sundry places, and his head upon the
gallows at hay hill over the three that were there hanged in chains. And
shortly after it was stolen away thence. Before he came forth to his death, he
did plainly declare that the lady Elizabeth and Courtney were nothing giltye
of his faction, Notwithstanding that could not set the lady Elizabeth at
liberty.

During this time many mad parts were played about the city of London, but
chiefly these: A cat dressed like a priest at mass with the cake over her
head between her hands, was hanged upon the gallowse at the cross in Chepe.
And a ma^tie dog, shaven in the crown, with a tippet about his neck was found
in the queen's closet, and a letter was fastened to his tippet wherein were these
words: I am a pore priest yt com to sue for a benefice.

About this time Cardinal Pole went from the Emperor to ye French king to
entreat a peace, but in vain.

The xviii. of May was hanged, drawn and quartered at tiburn, William Thomas
for co^spiring the queen's does.

The.xx. of July Philip prince of Spain, son to Charles.v. Emperor, arrived at
Southampton, and was there honorably received, and came ye fourth day after to
winchester where the queen had long looked for him, where matrimony was between
the^ honorably sole^nised, and the kingdom of Naples for the marriage sake, to
him by his father granted. Which things done, they rode royallye to London,
whither they came and were ^umptuously received the xviii. day of August. About
the end of October the emperor sent messe^gers to the king his son, to give
him possession of the dukedom of Millayn.

The.xii. day of November there was holden at westmynster a parliament, to
which Cardinal Pole was brought out of Brabant, being accompanied with the
English ambassadors sent for the same purpose among whom the Lord Paget was
one. He came to London the xxiii. of November. And the first day after, he
came into the parliament house, being restored to his old estate, from which
king Henry had cast him down, and in the presence of the king and queen, he
did after he had declared the cause of his lega^ie, exhort them all that there
represent^d the hole body of the (...) to return to the communion of the
church, and ^o restore to the most holy father his due authority.
Signifyenge unto them that his holiness was in purpose to show great clemency
and gentleness unto them. And further he exhorted them to give thanks to god
that had given them such a king and queen. And last of all, he did them to
understand, that he took it for a great benefit at their hands that they had
restored him to his former estate, and therefore he accounted him self the more
bound a great deal, to restore them to the heavenly court, which thing he
most desired of all things. And when he had thus spoken, he went out of the
parliment house.

Then stood up the lord chauncellor bishop of Winchester, and repeted the
Cardinals oration, with many words of exhortation to concord and unity,
affirmyng, that we ought to give most hearty thanks to god, that of his
unmeasurable mercy had styred us up a prophet of our own nation, which
gives himself wholly to do us good.

The day following, when the parliament had granted the Cardinals request,
they devised a form of supplication to the king and queen, wherein they
might most humbly beseech them to be means to the Cardinal for them. The
effect whereof was this. That they did earnestly repent them of their scisme,
in refusing to obey the apostolic sea of Rome, and in consenting to laws
made against the same: promysyng that thence forth they would be at their
commandment to do what soever they should be able to do^ in that parliament,
for the abolyshyng of all such laws and statutes.

The next day, so sone as the king, the queen, and Pool^ were again present,
the Chancellor stood up and declared what the parliament had decreed
concerning the popes legates request* And then he delivered to the king and
Queen, the supplication of the parli^ment sealed, humbly besechyng them to
receive it: which when they had received and opened it, they delivered it to
the chancellor again to be read, which he did, and asked of the w^ole house
whether they consented to it or no. And when they had answered, yea: then the
king and queen rose up* and delivered it to the Cardinal, who when he had
redd^ it, delivered the bull of his legacy to them, which was forthewith
read, that all men might understand, that the pope had given him power to
absolve them.

Afterward, he declared, how acceptable in the sight of god, the repentance
of a sinner is, and how greatly the angels rejoice over one sinner that
repe^teth. And in conclusion he gave thanks to God, that had given them a mind
so desirous of emendement. when this was done, he arose, and so did the king
and queen also, and then fell the king and queen down on their knees. Tha^ did
the Cardinal lift up his fyngers, and bless them, desyryng god to look
mercyfully upon the people, and to forgive the offense, and so he absolved the
whole multitude. And after this, they went to the chapel, where thanks were
given to god with pypynge and syngyng after the manner. Such as knew Pole
before, and had had acquayntance with him, meruailed much at these doings.
For they looked for far other things at his hand.

Now was the king, the queen, and all the commons at a good point, and in case
mete to proceed to the adua^cyng of Antichriste, and treading Christ under
foot in his members, as they did, in that they renewed three statutes for the
punisshement of Christ's people ^whome they call heretics) and in repealynge
statutes made against the apostolic sea of Rome, as they term it. And some men
thought, that Philip should have had the c^oun at that parliament, but it came
not so to pass.

In this mean while, many were kept in prison, that had been apprehended some
for preaching after queen Mary was procl^ymed, and some had actions of debte
(...) their charge, that they might ^e had in hold under color of law, till
the law was establysshed, that might make an end of them, if they would not
submyt themselves to the church of Rome.

Soon after the beginning of January, the parlyament was dissolved: And
immediately after, there were five men of god, and singularly learned in the
scriptures, brought forth of the prisone about London, where they had been
holden, as is said before. And because they would not submytte theimselues to
the popes authority, they were all condemned of heresy. Their names were John
Hopper bishop of Worcester and Gloucester, John Bradforde, Laurence
Saunders, Roulande Taylour doctor of the law, John Rogers reader of divinity
at Paul's. And shortly after was condemned Robert Farrer bishop of saint
David's in Wales.

All this while doctor Martyn was in great authority with the bishop of
Winchester, so that liberty and bands were in his hands, and well was he
that could obtain his favor. But now it was ne^d^full to have men more
bloody, for need mad^ Martyn myl^. There were therefore appointed in commission
for the ^xamination of heretics, sir Roger Cholmel^y knight, master Willyam
Roper, and Doc^our S^ory. An^ ^o bring them in were appointed Bea^d^, John
(...), and Robert Caley, two taylours and a prynter. And besides t^ese, there
were in every parys^e certain sworn to m^rke and present all such as showed
not themselves popyshe.

About this time it was determined, that ambassadors should go to Rome, to
render thanks to the holy father, for the great clemency that he had used
toward this realm, making faithful promise of obedience from thenseforthe
for ever. These ambassadors took their journey the lent following, one of
them was Thirleby bishop of Ely, and the other the lord Montacute.

John Bradforde was a man of such integrity of life that the cruel papists
could not for shame put him to death as yet, but reserved him in prison,
trustyng that time would wear out the memory of his godly life, but he so
behaved him self in prison, that the fame of his virtue grew, even to the
hour of his death.

In this mean while, the Emperor Charles labored by his brother Ferdinandus
king of Boheme, to bring the Germans to a general council* first at
Ulmes, and after at Auguste, to which the Cardinal Moronus should have comen,
to try whyther he could have done as much in Germany as Pole had done in
England. For the good success that Pole had in England encouraged the Pope
so, that he thought god was with him, and that his church could by no means
be convinced of error.

The.v. of March, Thomas Tomkyn a weauer, who dwelled in Shorditche without
Bishops gate at London, was burned in Smithfielde. This man had been l^nge

prove how he could away with burning.

time of the mynistration of their housell, as they call it. The same day was
bourned at Westchester George March preacher.

In this mean while, many learned and worshipful, and some noble personages,
besides honest commoners a great number, conveyed them selves beyond the seas
some under license, and some secretly, amongst whom the duchess of Suffolk
wife to Charles duke of Suffolk, was one, with her hus band Barthew, sir
Fraunces Knolles, and diverse other, chosyng rather to adventure affliction in a
strange countreye, than to submytte themselves to the Romyshe superstitious
orders, and to commit that gross ydolatrie, that the papists mainteyn.

About this time, great preparation was made for the queens chyldbedde,
Mydwiues, rocke^s, and other sorts of women in great number taken into the
queen's lodgyng at Hampton Court and not suffered to come home to their hus
bands. Besides that, great preparation of al thing pertaynyng to nursery, ^or
it was plainly affirmed out of the mouths of the queens (...), that she was
great with a man child, and some said with two. But in conclusion there was
^orne neither manchild nor woman, that could be known. Al^hough the priests
in every church through the ^ealm^* (...) diligently and earnestly moved the
people from time to time after they were about the beginnyng^ of November, by
testimony of the counsel certified that she was conceived, to pray that she
might bring forth a prince, that should by just title reign over the greatest
part of the christen world.

The last day of Aprile, in the morning before the gat^s of London were
opened, there came a merry f^low to the gate at the bridge foot, affirminge
that he mus^e ride in post thorough the City, for the Queen was that morning
delivered of a prince. This shift he used to get the gate opened. But this
word flewe so fast through London, and was so pleasant in the ^ares of
priests and parish clerks, that before.vii. of the clock, all the belles in
the City were walking, and shortly after Te deum, solemnly song, and
processions set forth with Salve festa dies, With the best Crosses and Copes,
and besides this bonefyres and bankets appointed against after none, And many
thretnyng words spoken against them that were not forwa^de in this over spedye
^eioycynge. At this time the Earl of Arundell being presydent of the Counsel,
lay^ at his house without Temple ba^re, And hering the great noise of belles,
he asked the cause thereof, And when they that were about him had told him the
news: he gave no such credit to it but that he would send to the Mayre of
London to know the truth. And when he could learn there none other truth
then that which the priests and clerks had confirmed with their singynge
and rynginge, he sent immediately to the court, and not content to tarry the
re^ourne of the messenger, he rode afte^ in post himself, and so learned that
the Queen, and such as were about her, had heard nothing of those joyful
news.

But these news stayed not there, for they ran in post not only into al parts
of England* but (...) al countries of Europe also, and some were puniss^ed, in
some parts of England, for saying it was a lie.

But after it was manifestlye known to be a lie, the people were very
desirous to so what s^ulde be borne to the stay of the succession of the
crown, for the w^ole number of mydwyues and rockers were retained still at the
court. But at the last all were sen^e away, and neyth^r prince nor princess
borne.

Rome and all his detestable inormities: good lord deliver us. For this cause he
was after his death suffered to hang still on the gallows, till he stanke, and
the^ being buried under the gallows, he was by the Bisshoppe of Londons

Flaunders, and spoiled and burnt Dunkirke before king Philip could come to
res kue. But before that the Frenchemenne returned again out of Flaunders,
they were met with by the Flemynges and the queen of Englandes ships, upon
the sands between Dunkirke and Grou^lyn, and of them slain a great number.

Then did both these mighty princes bend them selves wi^h all their power to
invade each other, and spent all that summer in camp in their own persons
with two mighty armies But after there had been in October much talkyng of
peace that should have been concluded, they did in November break up their
camp^s, without either peace concluded, or field foughten, or any notable act
done.

The.xv. of Aprile one John Maynerde died in Newgate, and was buried in the
field.

The.xxvi. of Aprile were bourned at Canturburye two women.

The.xxvi. of May were ^ourned at Colchester, John Haryson, Agnes George, and
one name^ Day.

In June were burn^d at ^orwi^he three persons. And the sam^ month one Thomas
Tyl^r, and one Mathewe Witlers died in Newgate, and were burned in the fields.

The.xxvij. of June were burned in Smithfield, Henry Bond a sadler, John
Slade, and other, to the number of.vii. at one fire.

The first of Iulye was bourned at wynchester one B^aynbricke, a gentylman.

The.xiii. of July were burned at Braynforde at one fire.vi. persons.

Shortly after this, queen Mary fell daungerousely sick, and to show her
some sign of his purpose, God took from her two of her chief physicians, but
all would not help. Her bishops and she burned even to the last breathe. For
even in November (the last month of her life) were burned at Ipswiche two, at
Bery two. And at Canturbery, certain persons. God therefore to give his
soldiers a breathyng time, took this rod of his from them the.xvii. day of
November, and set up in her place, the second daughter of the noble king
Henry, who by right title succeeded Edward and Mary, dyeng without issue.

Queen Elizabeth.
THis most noble princess began her reign over this Realm, the.xvii. day of
November, in the year of our Lord.1558. And was then at Hatfielde in
Hartfordshire, from whens her grace came shortly after to the City of London,
where she was so joyfully received of the people, that wise men might well
perceive what hope the people had conceived to receive at her hands the thing
that her sister had taken from them. On the contrary part, her behavior
toward the people was such, that if the people had not delited in her
before, yet must they now have showed them selves, either thankful to God for
so good a change, or else altogyther unworthy so gentylle, so loving, and so
coumfortable a Pryncesse.

But in her passing through the Cite to the tower, and from thens to
Westmynster, and at her Coronation there, which was the.xv. day of January
following: the people showed themselves so joyful, and she her self so
thankful, that it evidently appeared, that the Princess and people ^^ryued,
who should deserve more at others hand*

While these things were in doing, God wroughte yet more for his church, For
the next day after the queen Mary's death, the Cardinal Poole dyed also. And
within.iii. days after, the bishop of Rochester, and shortly after, the
bishop of Chichester. And generally, so many priests dyed in the realm in the
time of queen Mary's sickness, and about the time of her death, that doctor
Scotte bishop of Chester, preaching at Paul's cross, the.xxvii. of November,
affirmed that there was not for every.iiii. churches in England, one priest.
But bishop Boner of London besturred him, and made new priests as he had been
mad. What he mente thereby, lett^ wise men coni^cture.

The.xx. of January began a parlyament, wherein among other things, the
supremacy of the bishop of Rome was long debated, and every man suffered to
say what he could and would in the defense of it: but at the last

During the time of this parliament all preachinge ceased through the Realm
saving before the Queen in lent, where preached D. Cocks, D. San^s, D. Parker,
master Whithead, master Grindall, D. Byll, master Pedder, master Scorie,
master Lever, master Horn, master Samson, And master Wintrie. These all
bent themselves to the uttermost of their knowledge, to beat down Antichrist
and his power, and did therein so much that none yt had not his her^ altogether
hardened, would ones open his mouth against that they taught.

Thus did the Lord of his mercy take from his people his sharp rod, wherewith
he had duringe the days of Queen Mary chastised them, as it may well appe^re
by the noumber of them that suffered in the time of her reign, which were
many mo in noumber then are in this brefe chronicle remembered. But god has
their name in his book, and their tears in his bottell, and when the number
shall be fulfilled, he will be revenged upon the murderers. The Lord grant us
grace so to walk^ in his fear, that our virtuous Queen may^ continewe with
us, and set forth Gods truth, so his glory and our salvation. Amen.

day of Apryll.
