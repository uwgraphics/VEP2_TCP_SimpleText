How Broadas sone to the Soudan took Croyne and slew the king Tyber.
SO befell it as fortune i^ would one of the three sons came as ye wind
brought his navy by great tourment that he passed beside Croyne in galyce and
there he came up. So took he the land in a balyngere / and took of the men
about the ryuage. And when he had taken them he asked of them who was lord of
that country. And they answered and said that it was the rea^me of Galyce / and
that king Tyber was king thereof. Than asked the Sowdans sone what law they
held. And they answered and said the law of Ihesu christ. Tha^ made he to
withdraw his navy so as he would have withdrawn him fro the realm and from
the country / and took twelve ships and made them to be led to the port
of the town of Croyne and charged them that they should make them merchants
of swet^ gommes and of spycery and of clothes of gold and of sylke. And than
they should at even go lie in the town in their hau^ergeons under their gowns
and about the point of the day they should go upon the walls of the gate
toward the sea And that they should ge^e the gate and the walls and that they
should help them to scale and to come up in to the town. And so as he had
devised it was done So came the twelve vessels / and made them merchants
and sold spycery and clothes of damask and sold great chepe enough. And
sythen the merchants lodged in the town as nyghe the gate as they might. And
did make ready right good mete and made their host to soupe with them which
thought none evil nor no gyle / and when they had well sported them they went
to rest / and had take their poyntment (...) point of day upon the gate and
devised their ordinance. And when time came they went upon the walls / and
at the same time the Soudanes sone which was named Broadas the first sone of
them came to the foot of the wall with a great nombre of ladders / and so
went upon high. And they above the wall drew them up so many that with in
a little while there were upon the walls more than a thousand and gate the
gate and the town without any gayn saying / and did there much harm. And
sith assailed ye castle and there in was the king Tyber and him they took by
strength / and ye king defended him as much as he might right vygorously /
and he would never yield him / and so long he defended him that he was deed
and slain and that was right much harm / and the queen tho went out by a
posterne and had but a mantell wrapped about her / and went in to deserte. And
an old priest took the kings sone and.xiii. children more with him wihche he
taught / and went out and led them all and hid them in an old roche
beside a gardyne / and there were they two days without mete or drink / and
the old priest which was called sir Denis had so great dread when ye children
would go out of ye cave he came tofore them / and said unto them goo not out
if ye will not dye / and so he withhelde them two days but at the third day
Ponthus said to him master better it is to dy^ with sword than to be
enfamyned and to dye for hunger / for then should we be cause of our death
and homysydes of our self / and by adventure we should mow find some remedy.
The priest said that he had much lever to dye of hunger than to f^ll in the
danger of their enemies hands / and trembled for dread and by strength
Ponthus ste^te out of the cave he and his cosyn germayne Polydes and were
apperceyued and led to the king Broadas which than named him to be cleped
king of the country. And when the king saw these.xiii. children which were
meruaylous fair he asked what children they were And ponthus answered and said
yt they were children which ye king made to be nourysshed for gods love for
to serve him wha^ they were of greter age. And of what seruyse said Broadas.
Sir said Ponthus that one should have governed his grehoundes and the ky^ges
(...) hounds. And that other the gosshawkes (...) hawks of the tower / and
the other of needs in the hall and in the chambres. O said the king clothed he
his serving people so worthily as ye be clothed / ye seem to be great lords
sons after the estate I se you in. Sir said Ponthus we be but vauasoures and
of small gentylmen comen. By mahowne I wot not what ye be / but of beauty ne
of well speaking have ye not failed / but it behooves that ye leave your law
which is no thing worth and take mahownes law. And I shall do you much
good. And if ye will not do it I shall make you to dye a myscheuous death now
choose which that ye will. Sothely said Ponthus of the death mow ye well
ordeyne to your pleasynge / but for to forsake our law for to take mahownes ne
shall we never do for to dye therefore. No said the king to the death be ye
then come / so said he that they should dye an evil death.

How a christian knight saved.xiiii. children that is for to wete Ponthus and his
thyrtene folowes in a ship upon the sea.


THan sterte forth a christian knight which had take mahounes law for dread of
death / and had always his heart to Ihesu christ the which knight ye king loved
right much and said. Sir I take the charge upon me to deliver you if they will
not believe in mahoune I shall ordeyne for them in such manner that never shall
they hurt your law. I pray you said the king bethynke you. And I take
them you to govern. Than went Ponthus and the other to have be deed / but god
remedyed them / the knight led them to his place and made them strongly
aferde before the king. And wha^ he was at his place he made his folks to
withdraw them / and than asked of them for to assaye them in this wise / ye
must believe in mahoumet or ye be but deed. And they answered and said they
should never believe upon him to dye therefore. And when he saw them swear / he
had right great Joy and asked them if they had ete any mete that day and than
he made them to ete and drink for they had great hunger. A said one of them
wherefore ete we sith that we shall go to the death. Do way quod Ponthus by the
grace of god we shall live / if it be to his pleasynge / and we shall hope in
him / and he shall save us. So ete they and prayed our lord to have mercy
upon them. The knight herd what Ponthus said and praised him right much /
and said in his heart that it should be great pity if such children should dye
/ for they were meruayllous fair and fair speaking. So departed he fro them
and sought a vessel and made to be put therein by night living for a month.
And upon the morrow full erly he led the children to ye ship and set them
therein / and set within it a christian maryner which was prisoner with them and
made him to be hid with the living under ye hatche of the ship And when
the children were in the ship he made the sail to be lift up / and the
ship departed into ye high see / and the maryner sterte out fro byneth and
took the gouernayle and asked them wheder they would go. And Ponthus said fair
friend sith god has sent the to us thanked be he / led us and bring us into
the country of France. And he answered and said he should And badde them no
thing be abashed / and told them how the knight had made hy^ to be put in to
ye ship by night time / and their living with him Than said Ponthus fair
lords knele we down and thank we god which has done us so much good / and
pray we him that all be at his pleasynge. And so did all the children / and
were day and night upon their knees and said their prayers and their owres
devoutly and had their trust all only in god. So leave we of ye thyrtene
children / and return to the knight that had them in to the ship. The
knight was called patryke / and he went and told the king yt well was he
avenged of the children which would not believe in mahowne How said the king
have ye done. Sir said ye knight ye shall never se them / for I have set them
in an old ship without any manner of living of the world. And within have I
made two or three holes / and let draw the sail up to the top which bare
them in to the sea that never shall ye here tidings of them. I will it well
said the king for I have dremed to night that I saw the.xiiii. children in a
wood. And the fair child which spoke to me became a lion / and devoured me
and hurt me so much that I dyed as ^e seemed / so was I sore afraid. Sir
said the knight that was but a dreme of that that be ye quyte. I will well said
the king / than said the knight unto him By mahoune I ought to counsel you
truly / wherefore I read you that none be put to the death / but he will defend
him / for ye have made a fair conquest / for this is the fairest country and
the most delectable that is. And who that should slay ye people the land
should be without fruit. And men say comynly / as much auaylleth a myl that
gryndeth naught / as an oven ye baketh naught / let every man believe in such
law as he will / but all the fortresses / and the country that will not obey
unto you / and yield trybute be they dyscomfyted / and let ye other live and
labor / and ye shall be as rich as ye would / and ye shall be lord of the
country and the rich men which may be raunsoned that been prisoners take their
fynaunces / and by fayrenes draw them to our law of mahoumet. Than said ye
king / by mahoune ye counseyll us truly. Gooth and search the prisoners / and
they that will not believe in our law / be they trybutayrye and in seruage and
yield unto us trybute after their puyssaunce / and we put all the rule of our
law in you.

How the knight Patryke delivered from prison ye Earl Desture and ye other
christian men:
THus was the knight all gouernoure of their law of the prisoners / and of the
ordinance of the country. And the knight which that took no head but to save
the christian people and the country to his power went all about to search the
prisoners and put them to light ransom after that he found with them. And
among the other prisoners he found the kings brother of Galyce that was the
earl of Desture which was hurt of two wounds but not to the death. So was he
taught to which he was / and when the knight knew him he took him and led
him aside in to a chamber they two alone and said unto him. Sir if ye be the
kings brother I wot well ye have great desire to save the country and the
people which is fall in great caytyfnes and seruage till that Ihesu christ
set remedy there to / so say I you in good faith pryuely by your good
counseyll all the best remedy that I can or may I shall put there to Then
the earl had right great Joy to here speak of the name of Ihesu Christ / and
that he would the avail of the christian people and said unto him syghynge right
sore. Right sweet sir I wot never if ye say these words for to assaye me /
but if it pleased god ye your heart would it as your mouth says it I should
than our lord. Than said the knight unto him all his doing and how he had
be take in bataylle / and how for to refuse the death for to avail unto the
prisoners of that battle and to all christian men / he had feyned too be a
Sarrasyn and bare the sign but his heart was always in Ihesu christ. And he
told him how he had saved.xiiii. children / and how he had do so much to
the paynym king that none should no more be put to the sword. And that
every man should hold his law and yield trybute and be in seruage to the
king. And that he had do till god would set remedy thereto and how he had be
charged to rau^some the prisoners. Than the earl kneled down and thanked god
weeping* And the knight took him up and than clypped they together and kyssed
weeping and thanked Ihesu Christ. And when they had long weped of pity than
said they that god had assembled them for to do some good to ye people which
were in way to be deed and destroyed. And sir patryke said. Sweet sir I think
yet ye god shall have mercy on this country and of the people / and it behooves
to have the more space to speak together and to ordeyne ye common good and
profit of the christian people that ye feyne you to be a sarrasyn as I am / and
the king shall have right gre^e joy thereof / and I shall say it unto him /
and if god will we shall set such ordinance upon it that it shall be
profitable in a bydynge the mercy of god / and I shall tell you what mine heart
says me. Mine heart says me that the children which I have saved shall yet
relyeue this country again and also the king told me such a dreme. And than
he told him of the.xiiii. children and how ye gretest became a lion and
deuored hym^ A said the earl how much ye ease my poor heart for that is my
neuewe and my sone which god them led as mine heart wylleth and desires.
Tha^ swore they fellowship together to endure together in good or in evil and
kyssed them together with alyau^ce of love / and so had they devised together of
the rule and of the common profit / and upon that sir patryke departed and came
to the king and said unto him. Sir ye ought to thank mahowne of his grace for
I have converted the kings brothers heart of this country that is the earl of
Desture / he shall be of our Mahownes law. And we shall make you to have ye
great trewes and the great honor of this country / so shall he and I ride
tofore the towns and we shall speak to the cytezeyns and barons and to them
which will obey ye shall take to mercy and the other shall be punysshed. The
king had right great Joy of this and made ye kings brother to come before him
and made their alyaunce together. And the king rode tofore the towns and
fortresses with well a thyrty thousand fighting men so that all the country
was full of them the end was that all the country should be trybutary and
yield true unto the king. So did they there right great things which
should be to long to tell. And I pass forth for to abredge this matter and
leave to speak of ye king which reigned there well about twelve year so as by
a vengeance of god. And sith was the country made clean of the wicked law so
as ye shall here more plainly here after.

How ponthous and his felawes arrived by fortune in little bretayne / and how
ye seneshall Harlant found them upon a roche
HEre shall I turn again to ye children which were in the sea right heavy
and in great dread of their lives. But fortune which is right meruaylous
brought them to the parties of morygne that is little brytayne. So was the
wind strong and the torment of ye see great which made them to arryue up at
ye last / and that was toward a forest where was an abbay / and there was a
roche / and the sail and the mast were broken / and the ship smote upon the
roche / but god saved them for the sail yerde fell between two roches / and
the sail yerde saved them and came all upon the roche nyghe to ye land as god
would. So Joined they their hands together toward heaven / and thanked god /
and always be sought him with good heart / and god which forgate not the
clamor of his servants herd the voice of the children / and he sent them
socour in short time so as ye shall here. In what time reyned in bretayne
king Huguell a worthy man and a true / but he was old and of great age. And
he had but one daughter of all his children which was by a sister of the duke
of normandy. The mother was full of the gout and might not bestere her. The
daughter was the fairest / the swetest / the courtoysest that any man might
find in any country. And there was no mirth but of her goodness. So it befell
that Herlant the seneshall of brytayne a right good knight and a true / the
which was keeper of all brytayne that day hunted in the forest of suffone /
and as of adventure an heart went unto the water tofore the roche there ye
children were. Harlant looked and saw them on the roche / and came thither and
cried to them / and asked what folk they were. And they answered and said they
were driven thither by adventure. And than the seneshall smote his horse with ye
spores and came thither unto them / for the sea was withdraw / and yet ye horse
went to the belly. So made he them lepe up behind him and behind his knights
and his squyers / and brought them to the dry land. And than he asked them
what they were / and of whens they were. And they answered and said they were
of the country of Galyce. And one of them which hight verrac said unto the
Seneshall, Sir se Ponthus there which is the kings sone of Galyce and also
his cosyn germayne Polydes. And the other ben barons sons of galyce. And wha^
he herd that Ponthus was the kings sone he made to him right great chere and
did him great worshyp^ And set him in words of many things. And the child
which was wise answered him right wisely. And tha^ he told him how Broadas
the soudans sone had sealed Croyne and slain his fader / and taken the
country. And how he had be set in a ship / and also ye manner And when the
seneshall herd the dyscomfyture of ye country / and the sorrow of the realm
of Galyce he had great pity of the king and of the country / and that such
folk had the lordeshyppe upon christian people. So made he them to lepe upon
their horses and led them to vennes unto the king ye which was there as at
that time. And when that ye king saw them And had understanding of the death
of the king of Galyce / and the exyle of ye country he was all abashed and
wept and had right great sorrow / for he loved the king meruayllously. And
said that many times he had done him good and worship upon the parties of
spain where he had be in werres against the sarasyns in the kings felawshyp of
France. And I say you well said the king that it is right great harm to all
crystendome / for the king was a meruaylous good knight and a semely. And also
the coutre is both fair and good. And among all other things we bourtons
should have more harm thereby than any other nacyon / for we sent our
marchau^dyse to change with their good wynes. So have we lost more than we
know of / but god of his grace deliver the countrees of that false believe. And
sith that god has given me that grace to have the kings sone / and the barons
sons of that country I thank him thereof right hyghly / for I shall make them
to be nourysshed and to be learned as mine own propre children / and than
called he the Soneshall and betoke him Pouthus / and to each of the barons he
sent one. And departed them for a three year. And than he set term for to se
them again. And prayed each of them that they should be taught of the wood /
and of the river / and of the chesses / and of tables / and of all manner of
dysportes. And he which taught his best / him should he conne most thank.
And so departed he them as ye have herd.

How Harlant by the commandment of the king ladde with him Ponthus for to
nourysshe.


SO were the.xiiii. chyldre departed with the barons of Brytaygne and Herlant
went his way to govern Ponthus and taught him of all dysportes of the
chasses hawkynge hunting and of all mauere plays of the tables and of other
dysportes Right great was the name thorugh all Brytaygne of the great beauty of
the wit of the fair governance and of ye curtesye of Ponthus al of him
spoke far and nyghe and among all other things he loved god and holy church
And his first work was wha^ he was aryse^ to wasshe his hands to say his
prayers and to here his mass right deuoutely. Ne never ete he ne drank he
till he had said all his prayers such as they were / he gave of that he had
pryuely to poor men / and never ne swore he right great oath but his oath was
surely or so god help me my friend it was thus. If he played at the play of
ye tenys or any other play also Joyous was he when he lost as when yt he gate
/ and if men did him any wrong he showed it within a two words or three that
men did him wrong / and never ne strofe he ne brawled he let rather all his
right pass but he said well / ye should not have this for custom but I shall
rather leave of play than I should strive with you / men might not be angry with
him he spoke so many sweet words and always upon bourdes and myrthes. Never ne
loved he to mock man / and if men spoke any words of vices of ladies or of
gentylwomen or of gentylmen or of folk of the holy church he brake of the
words and said men ought not for to believe all that ever they herd some have
said it you which knew it not but by herynge and it is no need that al
reports should be soth / and also he blamed all manner of vngentelnesse. After
that he was the goodlyest yt mekest / the curteysest that any man might find /
for no man did of his hode so soon to him that he ne did of his as soon
again / he salewed ye little and the great mekely and made himself to be
beloved by his great curtesye / and he played never with no play that touched
to harm / ne bourded not of no bourdes dishoneste ne of dyspleasau^ce. What
should I say you he was the best enteched and the gracyousest that men might
find / and after that the goodlyest and the best fourmed that men might
behold / for he was great and large in ye breast and small in the waste / and
ye shuldres ye arms ye thyghes and ye fete were made of right deuyse / ye
vysage was clear brown / the eyes so meke / the mouth read / and the nose
streyte / he seemed like an angel / for the more ye had behold him the more
should it have pleased you to have seen him. What should I say you more all
about ne was there no speech but of him / and men speak so much of him that
the words came to court such ye fair Sydoyne ye kings daughter herd spoke
thereof / and herd the great words the beauty / the good manners of him and had
great desire to se him by such manner that she quaked all for desire and prayed
god yt she might se him in short time. She was the fairest lady hold of the
realm of France or of Brytaygne the swetest the courteysest and which best
could mayntene her estate among al manner folk.

HOw it befell that the term of three year was to come and that the king held
his feeste at Uennes at Penthecoste / and sent gowns of a suit all of one
clothe to the.xiiii. children and so sent for them that they should come to
the feast / and eueryche of the barons brought his and Herlant brought Ponthus
and the lord of Lauale brought Polydes his cosyn germayne with him which was
right goodly and more agreeable than all the other save Ponthus. And when that
Ponthus was come / every man beheld him and praised hy^. And when ye king
saw hy^ it needs not to ask if that he made him great chere and myrthe / and
said unto him that he was welcome / and that god granted him as much honor
and worship as he would him. The king held his feast of the barons / and of
knights on that one side. And the ky^ges daughter of ladies and of gentylwomen
on that other side. Great was the feast and the Joy of meruayllous dysportes.
Sydoyne which herd of ye great words of the great beauty and conning of
Ponthus was day and night in great thought to se him which she desired so
much / and she wist not nor knew to find the manner how she should come to
her desire / and to her worship therewith / all for dread of evil speech. But
the end was when yt she had bethought her enough she sent for Herlant the
seneshall. And when he was come / she gave him a right fair palfraye / and a
meruayllous gentle faucon and a good / and made him right great chere / and
Herlant meruayled much of the good chere yt she made him / and doubted well
that some thing she would / and after that she said unto him / a fair
seneshall fair friend it needs that we se your child that ye have nourysshed
that is Ponthus which is well learned and right wise. I pray you bring him to
us to day that we may se him / and come your self with him / for men have
told me that he syngeth and daunceth well / therefore I would se him sing and
dance. Madame said the Seneshall I shall bring him sith that it pleases you.
Than said she we shall se if it be sothe that men said. The seneshall took
leave and departed. And always he was a wise knight and doubted that his good
chere and his presents were for Ponthus love / and so was he in great study
what he should do / and said to himself. A saint Mary / if I bring Ponthus he
is so fair and so goodly that these women should mow be enamoured on him in
such wise that she should not have none other but him / and she should mow
have such love that she should be apperceyued / and than might she have blame
/ and than the child should be lost by envy / so ne wyste he what to do / so
he thought he would bry^ge his cosyn germayne instead of him for many causes /
for he doubted much the king for evil that might befall. So came he again
and brought with him polydes. And Sydoyne went in to her wardrope and had a
maid which was named Elyos / which she loved / and in whom she trusted more
in than many other / and she had told her all ready how she had great desire to
se fair Ponthus of whom all folk spoke of. And she had a little wyndowe
where she had always her eye / for he should come on that party. Another time
she took her myrrour and called Elyos to se if there neded her any thing that
were not well at the point. So at the last as they looked out they saw the
seneshall come and Polydes which was right fair and goodly. So came she down
in to the chamber and made them right great chere and right great Joy and took
Polydes by the hand / and would have made him to have sit down beside her.
And Polydes said. Madame I shall not be so nyghe you / for that were no reason.
Sothely said she if ye be a kings sone wherefore is it no reason. Madame save
your grace I am none. And be ye not the kings sone of galyce / no madame I am
his cosyn germayne A said she sothely I wend ye had been he. So made she him as
great chere as she might / but for all that she was right angry / for she held
herself be mocked And than called she the seneshall aside and said unto him /
A seneshall ye have begyled me / how so madame / ye should have brought me ye
kings sone of Galyce and ye brought me his cosyn german / wherefore have ye
do yt / what may ye think therein / wherefore hold ye me so unwise. Than the
knight kneled down and said. A madame mercy for gods love and dysplease you
naught for in good faith I thought but well / but I might not bring him at
this time. Do way said she than should ye have abide as yet and not have
brought a another for him / ye doubt you of me I am not so young but that I
can keep mine honor and my worship doubt it naught. Madame said the seneshall
I thought but well / but I doubted the king your fader which loves you so
much yt if ye made him but a little better chere tha^ any of his felawshyp yt
they should have envy to hy^ / and that there might come evil thereof / the
world is so full of evil langage that there were as ye thought but good and
worship they should say and note otherwise / Ha said she seneshall ne have no
doubt for I had lever to be deed then any man might repreue me of my worship
be ye certain thereof / madame god it would also wisely as I have you more dear
than any woman living / and sith ye assure me so I shall bring him to you.
Now I pray you then quod she ne tarry not long. And ye seneshall went to
seche him / and Sydoyne went up in to her warderobe where she had a little
wyndowe which opened toward yt side where as they should come. So ne was there
but she and Elyos her well-beloved gentylma^. Elyos said she take me my myrour
and look if me need any thing. by god she said / Madame ye be right well. Look
tha^ if he come / and Elyos went often and many times to se if they came / and
so long was one of the^ at ye wy^dowe for to abide ye coming of him which
she desired so much / than Elyos came rennynge strongely and said Madame
madame se where he comes ye fairest of ye world / and Sydoyne came renny^ge
and sterte forth al at ones unto that side / and she saw ye seneshall come and
him together / and she saw him so fair and so goodly yt she was al meruaylled.
And than she spoke and said. A A Elyos my love me seems he is meruayllous
fair. Fair lady said Elyos / he is no man / he is an angel / never saw I
so fair a creature of man / god has fourmed him with his propre hands. By my
faith said Sydoyne Elyos my fair love ye say troth / and I believe the / also
as she which was caught with ye love of him. Than came she down in to her
parlyament chamber with her ladies and gentylwomen / and it tarried not long yt
he and the seneshall came in / and Ponthus auau^ced hy^ and enclyned hy^ right
low and salewed Sydoyne and her felawshyp / and Sydoyne took hy^ by ye hand
and wend for to have made him sytte upon a cuysshyn beside her / but he said.
Madame yt is no reason yt I should sytte so nyghe you so made he much
courtesye. But she said wherefore make ye such courtesye / be ye not a ky^ges
child as I am. Do way madame it is no co^paryson / for ye be a mighty ky^ges
daughter / and I am ye sone of a king dysheryted / and have no thing but ye
good doing of my lord your fader which has done me so much good. A Ponthus
quoth she leave of these words / for god has not made you as nature shows for
to unmake you ye be shapen to have much more good and worship than ever had
your fader / and god it grant.

How Sydoyne spoke gracyously to Ponthus and began for to love him without any
point of vylany.


MAdame I may not se that way / but all be it in the mercy of god / now
sytteth down quod she I command you. So sat he a little bynethe. Tha^ she
said to the ladies I pray you make the Seneshal sport and wete if that he has
any thing forgoten of his song. Madame I may no thing forgete. So took they
him for to dance and for to sing / and to lead Joy. Sydoyne which seete him
in words of many things held him right wise of his age and among all other
things she said unto him. Ponthus ye have be long time in Brytaygne and have
not seen us. Madame he said I am in governance so must I needs obey. That is
reason she said / but I ask you have ye any lady and these ladies which ben
here in please they you. Madame yes sothely for it is a noble felawshyp to se.
Now said she have ye yet set your heart upon any lady or gentylwoman for to be
her knight when time comes. Madame in good faith nay / for the service of me
should be but little. Ponthus she said save your grace / ye be come of so good
a place yt ye be lykely to serve the gretest gentylwoma^ and ye fairest of all
brytayne. So had they between them fair langage enough / and so much yt
she said unto him. Ponthus when ye have ye estate of knight hode I will yt ye
hold you for our knight / and when that I here yt ye do some good I shall have
right great Joy to here it / madame I thank you. God grant me yt I may do
some good yt it may be pleasant to you and to all your ladies but I am little
shapen thereto for ye deed of a poor man is but of little thing. Tha^ she said
I shall say you. I will well yt ye wete how well that I hold you for my
knight / yt wha^ time comes that ye shall be knight / yt if ye do better tha^
any of mine other knights. I shall hold you most dear / and ye shall fail
no thing that I have. And I shall say you what ye shall do / ye shall swear
to serve me above all other in worship / and doubt not I thy^ke but good and
worship. A madame he said I thank you as much as* I may of this great worship
which yt ye proffre me / and god grant me to deserve it. I shall say you she
said I shall love you as my knight when time shall come in such manner that if I
apperceyue that ye think any vylany / never shall I love you after. Madame I
had lever be deed than for to think that were not to your worship / and to my
lords your fader. Also than ye shall swear this to me and promytte as a kings
sone / Madame sothe by my faith. Tha^ she gave him a ring with a dyamonde ye
shall bear this dyamonde she said for the love of me. Madame grant mercy. So
he took it and set it on his finger. And after that she led him to dance /
and prayed him to sing a song / and he did her commandment as he which
was tho taken with the love of her. So sange he a meruayllous song and a sweet
And he was behold of ladies and of gentylwomen which praised him much / and
said eueryche in their hertes that well should she be worshypped that he
vouched safe to love And after that they had daunced she made to come wine
and spyces / and gave the senesshall a cup of gold full of wine / and said
unto him. Seneshall I give you with my hand the wine and the cup. And the
seen shall thanked her. And when they had sported them enough the seneshall
said. Madame ye shall give us leave to se the king your fader / and she gave
them leave / and prayed the seneshall that they should come se her again often
/ and he said so they should. So looked each of them on other at the departing
/ and she held her as covert as she might / and wha^ they were departed / they
asked together that one lady of that other / what say ye of Ponthus / and there
was none but yt they praised him meruayllously / whereof there were some of them
that said. A well eurous should that lady be which shall have such a love /
she shall mow say that she has the flower and the goodlyest of the world.
So praised the ladies Ponthus and it did Sodoyne great good to here this / she
durst say no thing but that she said he is fair enough / but men can not
yet say the sothe whereto he shall turn / and therefore he ought not yet to be
ouermoche praised. And that she said upon her heart but that was for to here
the manner of the spekers. The feast dured three days full and there were Iustes
and many strange plays made.

How tidings came to the king of brytayne that the sarasyns were comen in to
his realm.


ANd among all other things there befell meruayllous things / for there came
messangers which said that the sarasyns were come down toward breast / and
had taken the land and were more than thyrty thousand / whereof the court was
all to troubled. And at the hour of mydday there came up a knight / and two
squyers sarasynes in message on king Karados behalf the sowdans sone. And
that was one of the three sons whereof ye have herd. That knight was great and
broad in the sholders / fyers and proud / and had trewes whereby that he might
come and speak. So said he on high that the sowdans sone was come upon that
country for to do away the christian law / and for to publysshe mahowmettes
law. And he sent to the king of brytayne that he should leave his law / and
take mahonnes law. And ouermore that he yield trybute of every fire house of
the realm and if he will not he will dystroye brytayne and put it al to the
sword. The king herd the menaces and the pride. So was there none that
answered again ne said one word. Tha^ Ponthus saw that no man spoke a word
/ and he sterte forth and went to say. I am a child and I am simple / but I
shall not here our holy law so dispysed tofore me but that I shall speak. So
went he and kneled tofore the king and asked him leave And the king granted
him when he saw that the other would not speak / than he said to the knight
sarasyn. I answer that your law is but dampnacyon of the fend / and death of
everlasting fire. And ours is salvation and Joy which shall always endure /
and wha^ that we yield you trybute we be false / nor never shall we do you
sernage and god will. Than said the sarasyn if there be any two that will fight
against me / yt mahowne is not greter than your Ihesu Christ. I shall fight with
them. Than answered Ponthus / never and god will ne shall we set two against one.
I am young and feeble / but I cast my glove in pledge to defend that word /
and say that Ihesu christ is the sone of god / and mahowne is the sone of the
devil / and he cast it down tofore the king / and the sarasyn took it up
and said. Child I should fight with ye and with another. I ask none but me
said Ponthus. The king and the barons were greatly wroth that Ponthus had
waged battle but they might not amend it. And than the king said. A Ponthus
ye have betrayed us / and set us at great vnhertes ease / which have be so
hasty to cast your pledge and be so young against that knight which is so
great and so hard. Sir said Ponthus wot ye not how Danyel which was a child
saved Susanne by the mean of god / meruayll not of the might of god / whom
that he will help him needs not to dread. I hold me sure and hop^ in him. So
ne doubt no thing of me. When the king herd him speak he wept and turned
his vysage aside of the goodness of the hardynesse / and of pity that he had
of the child / and prayed in his heart that god would hy^ save. Sir make me
knight with your hand said Ponthus / and give me arms and I shall go do my
devour. And the king made him knight and gyrde him with the sword / and
kyssed him weeping that he might say no word / and sith armed him with his
best armor of his tresourye and took him the best horse that he had. And when
he was on horsbacke armed he was so goodly to se / so right and so well
shapen / the feet the legs so straight and sat so well on horsbacke yt it
was a fair thing to se / his thyrtene fellows wept for pity and of dread.
Harlant the seneshall was heavy / so were there all manner of folk which saw
that he was so young / and had to do with so great an adversary / for men said
that he was ye hardest and the strongest of the sarasyns. Right great was the
cry when Ponthus was armed for to fight for the faith / so much that the
words came to tofore Sydoyne / but it needs not to ask if she had great
heaviness and dread of her knight / and she sent him a pensell to set upon
his spear / and when he saw the pensell his heart awoke / and he thanked her.
And she set her all still in her closette in her oryson prayenge for him.

How Ponthus ouerthrewe the sarasyn that said that his law was better than the
christian.


ANd when all was ready the paynym said to him. Child go seek another for to
help ye for thou art right young / and I have pity of the / for you art right
fair / so should it be right great harm if it befell that I slew the. By
mahowne it should be good to vnsaye that thou have said / and pray mahowne
that he forgive the / the vylany that thou have said of him Knight said Ponthus
leave thy Jangling you shalt se sone enough the virtue of Ihesu christ defend
the if you will / and he afraid him a little and took his spear and came to
him a great pace and smote him between ye shield and the helm that he perced
the mayle and the doublet / and put the Iren and the tree between ye neck and
the sholders / and the tree brake well a two foot from the heed which grieved
him much / and the paynym smote Ponthus in the shield and brake his spear in
his breast. And when the king and other saw these Iustes / they thanked god
and said that Ponthus had Iusted right fair and prayed that god should help
him. Ponthus passed forth and made his course and set his hand on his sword
/ and came toward the paynym and gave him so great a stroke that he kytte a
two half his ventayle and vnmaylled it so that ye vyser bename him the sight
and the paynym rent it of so boystously yt his vysage was all dyscouered / and
than had the christian men great Joy and great hope / and the paynym drew his
sword of stele and smote Ponthus so that he made all his heed to shake and his
eyes to sparkle in his heed / so he felt him astonyed of the great stroke /
and smote the horse with his spores and came again and smote him a great stroke.
So was ye battle between them strong and long endury^ge / and all ways
Ponthus waited to smite the paynym in the vysage / which was dyscouered / and
so much that he went to cast such a trauers / that he smote the nose the
mouth and the chyn / so yt all held not but the skyn / so bledde he strongely
/ and so much he bledde yt all his shield before was blody. The king and the
people which saw that stroke made right great Joy and thanked god. The
paynym lost the blood and febled fast and so much that uneaths he might hold
him on his horse / and Ponthus ran upon him sharply till he cast him down
as he that had lost his blood and might hold himself no more. Than Ponthus
took and rent of his helm from* his heed / and afterward smote him such a
stroke that he made his heed for to flee too the ground. And he bowed down
and nyghed it with his sword / and lift it up and bare it unto the two
squyers sarasynes / and said unto them in this wise Fair lords I present you*
with your masters heed / and bear it to the sowdans sone your king / and tell
hy^ that at his request / and for the proof of your law and ours that battle
has be done / and that Ihesu christ has showed by a child that he is very
gods sone / and also that by his might he shall show between us which
holds the wicked law / and tell him that wtin short time men shall se who
shall have ye myghtyest god. So goo your way all surely. For messangers ought
not to have no dread / if they of their request be come be it to do deeds of
arms or for to do other things. The two squyers sarasyns took ye heed / and
so did they the body / and bare it to their king and said unto him the manner
of ye request of ye battle fro point to point / and how the battle had be do
/ And how he which had fought ne was but.xviii. year of age at the most. And
the king was right sorry of it and right heavy and all other lords sarasynes /
and meruaylled much of such an adventure / for they held him the strongest
and the best knight of their party. So made they him to be buried after their
law / and was much playned and bewaylled. Here leueth of him now / and turn
we again to Ponthus.

POnthus smote his horse with the spores / and went to the chief church and
alyght there / and went to thank god mekely and said lord sweet Ihesu christ
it is meruayll of you and of your deeds / for by your grace I have ye better of
mine adversary / lord it has not ben I but it has been ye which remembered
you of your little servants / lord have mercy and pity of me thy servant
and of this poor country which is in thine hand. And than he made his
offering / and after took his horse again and went and alyght before the
king. So needs it not to ask if the king and the barons and all they made
hy^ Joy and right great chere. The king beclypped him and kyssed him saying /
fair sweet friend we hope in you of ye delyuerau^ce of this country which our
adversaries will undo. After that needs it not to ask if Sydoyne and the
ladies made Joy and mirth and said sothely / beauty / bounte ben assembled in
Ponthus and he shall do many meruayles god save him and keep him from all
evil. After that the king made his barons and his knights to come together /
for to have their advise of ye mysbyleuers which were come in to that country.
So asked the king their advise / and they were all afraid and abashed for ye
great nombre that were of them / and it was spoken of in many manners. And than
the king asked of Ponthus and he made right strange for to speak / but ye
king commanded and prayed him that he would tell his advise And he said to me
it appertains not to speak which am so young and so little of conning / and
there where as be so many good knights / but to fulfill your will and to please
you I shall speak as a scoler of arms / and as a child among wise folks /
but always ye shall foryeue me my folly. Sir it seems me yt how many there be
of these folk in great nombre they ought not to be doubted / nor we ought not
for to make so much doubt for we shall be and ben in god almighty which may
save and dystroye by a little folk a great nombre / that is to say one
against an hundred in his faith to keep them / all this deed touches to all
christian men / for this is the seruyse of god / and all ye christian people shall
come hyder to our help / for if they had get our country the other should
not be assured. And therefore I say by the good counsel of the good knights
which ben here / ye shall send to the good knights princes barons your
neighbors / for to be here within.xv days / and by the help of god and
theyrs / ye shall do them such harm that never shall they can amend it / and
anon present ye shall send by your fortresses / and make them to be stuffed
well of living and of their things / and make towns and castelles to be
reprayed again / and make the vytayl to be withdrawn between this and them. And
specially upon the parties where as they ben. This counseyll was holden for
good above all / and was fulfilled. And messangers were sent to neighbors by
all the country / that is to wete upon normandye to the vycounte of auerenches
/ to the earl of Mortayne / and to paynel / and in to Main / to the vycounte
du lieu / to the lord de la vale de doucelles and of Sygle / and also to the
countess of Anioye / for the earl was deed / and her sone was but.x. year
old. And there was wryte^ to pain of chateau Goutyer / to Guyllam de roches /
to Bertram de done / and to Androwe de la toure / and in to poytowe was written
to the earl of poytyers / and he was departed to goo to Rome / and also there
was wryte^ to Geffrey de lesygnen / to leoncel de manleon / and to Henry de la
march. So were they chosen for the best knights in that country / and the
king of Brytayne prayed them that each of them should do all the good
knights and squyers to wete thereof that they knew in these countrees / and
that wrote so hastily yt he might not write to all Eueryche of them that these
letters were written unto wrote to all them yt they thought would arm them /
and eueryche of them wyste that the sarasyns would get brytayne and the
crystyente / all manner folks came drawy^ge down to ye need / eueryche in the
best wise that they might and so many yt within the.xv. day there was of all
countries neighbors right much folk / and the barons were all ready / the
assemble was made at vennes / and the king made them great chere / and did
them great worship. So departed they to go toward breast where ye host of
sarasynes were which pylled the country and set it at destruccyon. But than
were there gone four thousand for to see the host / and they doubted to have
a battle / and men approached unto quypercorentyne / and there the king and
Ponthus and the barons ordained their bataylles. The king had a battle and
party of his barons / and for yt he was old there was take to govern him the
vycounte de lion / and the lord of clymaux of ye brytons brytonauntes. And of
Galos. Guy de vetre. Rowlande de dueil / and Rogier de ronge / and ye other
battle was take unto Ponthus and to Herla^t to govern Of ye normannes ye earl
of Mortayne / and the vycounte of Auerenches the governance / and the earl of
Man's governed the mansaus / and of the gree of barons and knights of anioye.
Guyllam de roches. Androwe de la toure / and the lord of done were ordained
to govern the herupoys / that be the aungeuynes. And the poyteuynes were
governed by Geffrey de lesignen / and the earl of manleon. The normannes were
nombred.xi. hundred / the manseaus.ix. hundred / the aungeuynes.x. hundred /
the poyteuynes two hundred / and the brytons four thousand / and of the
normannes and the manseaus were one battle / and of the poyteuynes and the
Torengeaulx that other battle / for of Touraine there was Bansaye maille la
haie Amboise And so made they four great bataylles / whereof Ponthus and
Harlant made the va^warde for the king. Sythen the earl of Man's / and he of
Mortayne / and the aungeuynes / and the poyteuynes made the rerewarde. So rode
they toward their enemies / and lay upon the field / and ordained the half
dele among them to watch / and the other half dele to sleep. And about
mydde night they had a great fraye / for Reynault de sully / and Aygret de
poully / with well a three hundred sheldes come drawing down to the needs /
the which men knew / and than when men knew them / they made of them right
great Joy. So put they them with their will with the aungeuynes. And the
king said unto them and to Bertram de do^ne / and to Androwe de la toure /
fair lords god bethanked / there is much folk of us / and of great
worthynes / and our refuge and our dongeon is in you and in your hands. So ye
come without that ye were desired in good ordinance / and assemble not till ye
se we have great need of you. Ponthus and Harlant the senesshall ordained the
barons / and Ponthus said unto ye king and the lords. My lords if ye will
leave me. I counseyll that we goo upon them tofore day / or about the point of
day / and or they be armed or their horses sadled / and or that they be set
in ordinance / and they shall be half dyscomfyted / for they hold them so
great folk that they doubt no man. And therefore me seems that it shall be so
done that they shall be the easelyer dyscomfyted Sothely said the king and all
the barons this counsel is good. Now take we our horses for it is time. Than
every man armed him / and lepte upon their horses And the weder was still and
fair / and the moon shone right clear. So rode they toward ye host of ye
sarasynes / which were toward priest in their pauylyon / and had taken their
counseyl yt sith they were not fought with yt they would over ride brytayne and
led with them engynes and ladders for to assail towns and castelles / and
they doubted not to have battle / and made no watch ne none awayte to tell of
/ but held them as folks assured / for ye great nombre yt were of them. Now
befell that the bataylles approached so nygh yt they saw the sarasyns which yt
occupied well two mile. There were many pauylyons of many diverse colors.

How Ponthus yt had the first battle recomforted his felawes / and how
bernarde de do / landry de la tour and Guyllyam de roches socoured Ponthus and
his folk.


THan Ponthus which led the first battle saw them and said to his folk.
Se here the enemies of our faith which will dissheryte us / we be in the
service of god almighty / wherefore no man ought to have doubt that one of us
ne is worth an hundred of them. I pray you of two things / that one to trust
all in god / for by his might ye shall come above them That other that ye take
none head to no pyllynge to no couetyse / but go to dyscomfyte them / and put
them out of this country for ye honor of our law / and for the pity of the
common people which dwell out of the fortresses / and have so much trauayll
for the goods and ye profytes whereby we live. And for that we be ordained for
to defend the church and them. And when he had said all unto them that he
would he said. Now forth my friends and think every man for to do well. Than
every man took heart unto them / and smote their horses with the spores toward
the tents and made a great cry / and smote down tents and pauylyons / and
to slay turks / and some sterted out naked / and wend to have armed them /
and the other fled fro pauylyon to pauylyon. So was there on their side great
hewy^ge and great cry on all parties / and the day began to appear and wexed
clear. Brytons slew all that they might hold / ye other put a fire in the
lodges in such wise that it was all clear. King Karados was all afraid / and
made his trumpes and his trumpettes to blow / and anon every man armed them /
and lepte upon his horse that might. So were they all overtaken / for on all
parties men ran upon them surely / but there were so great nombre of them /
wherefore or men might have conquered the third part of his host / that other
were on horsbacke and armed / and assembled them by great flocks upon a great
plain with right a great battle / and with his folks well armed / and each
held them in ordinance with the chyeftene for it was come to the need. Than
should ye have seen the sarasynes enbatayll them in great manner / and always
they were overtake in such wise that they were more than.vii. thousand deed /
that was about the fourth part of their folk / and all had well nyghe
fled. And king Karados which was of great courage of that that he was on
horsbacke / took his baner in his hand for to make his folk to come again /
and they herd his voice and his cry / so gave he hardynes to the most
cowarde of them. And about the son rysynge was there great hewynge and
great cry / for at that time / the three bataylles of our folk were assembled
upon the sarasyns there was a right pyteous stoure of our folk which set fire
in their lodges and slew them King Karados rayled a battle of well a seven
thousand turks and would have come to smite upon the side of ye battle of
our folk which had much to do / and so much that they went abacke. And
than said Androwe de la toure Bertram de done / and Guyllam de roches. Lords
it is time to depart / se our folks which lose their places / and also
behold a great battle which comes to smite upon them / abide we not till
that they smite for that should be peril. Tha^ dressed he his spear upon his
thyghe and went renged against the king Karados.

How Ponthus helped the king of brytayne that was overthrown and had him out
of the prees.

How Ponthus helped the king of brytayne that was overthrown / and had him
out of the prees.


ANd when he saw them come he turned to themwarde and made him ready before /
for to go give them strokes with his spear / and his cosyn germayne Broalys
which was a good knight / and went to smite Bertram de done / and Androwe de
la toure. The king bette down Bertram / and Androwe bette down Broalys and
took his horse and gave it to Bertram de done / and he said unto him / fellow
that is not the first service ye have done me. The sarasynes assembled about
Karados / there were many fair Iustes between two batayles. Guyllam de roches
and Geffrey de lesygnen each of the^ beat down his / but I knew not their
names. Than assembled they on all parties There was great frusshynge of speres
and many folks overthrown that had no power to releue themself. and than set
they their hands to their bright swerdes of stele / and there was great noise
of the deed / and of them that were hurt. On that other party ye king of
brytayne faught which was fallen of his horse in the battle / and was right
sore bruised / but that Ponthus came upon him of adventure / and when he saw the
king on the earth and his horse above his body / it needs not to ask if he was
right sorry and heavy. And wete well that he was in way to be deed / ne had be
Royart deronge / and Mountfort / and the lord of Clymaus these three among
other sustained the great deed / and suffered much. But Ponthus set his body in
adventure to rescue his lord / and set his hand on his sword and smote on
the right hand / and on the left sleynge men and horse and did deeds of arms
/ so yt all meruaylled of him greatly and so much he did that all fleldde with
his strokes. In little while he departed the great prees with the help of
Harlant the senesshall and his cosyn germayne Polydes / these two felawes sewed
him what party that ever he went. And Ponthus did so much of arms that he
rescowed the king / and alyght to help him up again. The kings right arm
was broken and right evil led for he was right old and bruised / for he was
of an hundred year of age and more. but he had been a right good knight and of
great courage / on horseback was he set maugre his enemies. When Ponthus
apperceyued that his arm was broken. So sent they him out of the battle
would he or not / and was withdrawn. And the battle was right cruel on that
one side and on that other. And Ponthus beheld that the battle on the best
side had much a do / where the earl of Dongres was Gautyer de rays Bernarde de
la roche. Geffrey dauncemys. Bryaunt de quynten. Mountfort / and many other
barons of brytayne which were overthrown and were in great adventure to be
deed or taken. For against one bryton was.x of the sarasynes / but above all set
he him in great defense Bernarde de la roche. Than said Ponthus / se our folk
which have great need of help / go we and rescue them / than smote they the
horse with the spores their swerdes in their hands / and came so styffely that
they frusshed all tofore them. And Ponthus went tofore them sleynge all that
ever he smote / and bette and slew and maimed folk so much that the
hardyest made him way. So did they so much within a little while that they
recovered our folk and put the sarasynes to flight would they or not. And made
them to resort again in to the great battle which was right grievous and
peryllous for the great nombre of paynyms the which smote upon the christian
men's helmes. King Karados held with great dystres the earl of Man's / and
the lord of Craon / and had overthrown them and many of the manceaus and
herupoys / as Hamelyn de sylle. Geruays de la port. Thy bault de matheselon.
Peter de doncelles. Sauary de la hay. Gerarde de chateau goutyer. Guyllam de
roches. Geffrey de lesygnen / and Leoncel. But they defended them on foot / and
were assembled which auayled them much. Androwe de la toure / and Bertram de
done set great pain for to recover them / but there was so great prees of
sarasynes / and so great a folk that uneaths might they come to them / till
that Guyllam de roches saw Ponthus which that made the renges to shake with
the help that sewed him. Sir it is need se yonder a great party of our barons
the which ben on foot. Than smote they on that side / and brake the prees in
such wise that they recovered the earl and them the which had need / and
right soon they were on horsbacke again. And tha^ the battle began right
cruel / for at that time there was none that would besene a cowarde. Great
cry and great hewynge there was on every party. And king Karados did great
and meruayllous deeds of arms / he and Broalys / and Corbatan his uncle Tho
were the three knights of all the sarasyns which sustained most their folk:
making the great stoures and the great deeds of arms and which most releued
again in their great need.

How the king Karados was dyscomfyted by Ponthus and his folk.
POnthus beheld the king which did right great deeds of arms and saw him
right rychely armed with perles and precious stones / and upon his helm a
rich crown of gold / and slew many of the christian people / and had
overthrown Guyllam de roches / and slain Guyllam de dygnan / and bette down
many knights and wounded. Than said he to Androwe fair lord what an
adversary have we of that king and of his two knights which be beside him /
if they dure long they will do unto us much harm. And if these three might
be set on foot or to the death / it seems me that we should have ye high
hand of them Sir said Androwe de la toure / goo to that one / and we shall go
to the other two. Than said Ponthus I shall go to ye king / and put me in
adventure of all his strength And he went forth and gave the king so great a
stroke that he bette him down of his horse to ye earth / and at the falling he
brake his canell bone. And Androwe bette down Broalys / and smote of his right
arm that he dyed withal. And Harlant the seneshall smote Corbatan again so
felony that he bette him down / and when these three were defowled it needs
not to ask if they sarasynes were abashed / for ye dyscomfyture was there
right great / and all their power was fallen / and they dwelled as sheep without
shepeherde. Than took they them to dyscomfyture and to lose land. And than
our cresten folk took boldness upon them and to have the cry of them / so
slew they many of them from thens forth. The king might uneaths releue
again / so slew him one that bare the lion that was Reynault de vytre or
deglysson I wot never. The sarasynes wist not where to flee or to hyde them.
On ye coost toward the navy was a right great stoure of sarasynes / which
wyste not yet of the death of their king / and had bette down Bausaye mayle.
Geruays daner / the mount John^ / and pain de rochefort / and there held they
strayghtly our folk. But when they saw their folk slain / they meruaylled
much / and when our folk with whom they fought / saw them affrayed they took
heart to them / and ran upon them. And also there came to rescowes Geffrey de
lesygnen / and leoncel the herupoys and brytons so many / that they made them
to leave the place / and there was great slaughter of paynymes and of sarasynes.

How the sarasynes were ouercomen and drowned.


POnthus did meruayllous deeds of arms / for he slew folk and also horse /
and all that he took with the stroke was deed defouled or beten down his
shield was to all presented / he departed the great strokes with his bright
sword. So Joined there them together Geffrey de lesygnen. Androwe leoncel.
Guyllam de roches. Bernarde la roche / and Harlant the seneshall. And when they
were assembled together they did meruayllous deeds of arms / for there where
they saw ye great prees / they bette in and broke in among them / and made
them to make way who that ever it happed with their good swerdes of stele /
none ne durst abide them. And Ponthus which did meruayllous deeds of arms
was known by the strokes which he departed on the right side and on the left
So cried he unto them / they be dyscomfyted the paynymes which were as bestes
without shepherde / for their king / and their capytaynes were tho deed / so
could they take no good counseyll ne set no remedy in them / and so they
let themself be to all hewn. So was there within a little while such
slaughter that all the feldes were strawed with deed men and with maimed / and
they fled toward the navy / and drowned them in the water / and our folk
pursewed them and made them to be drowned and perysshed. Ponthus took a little
vessel / and slew well a.xxx. which hasted them for to save them / and took
four all on live / and asked them where the tresour and the riches of ye
king was And they showed him a fair ship / and than he said led me thither
or ye shall dye / and they led him thither. And Ponthus and his cosyn germayne
Polydes and seven of his felawshyp sterte in to the ship and slew and cast
out all that they found therein in to the water So looked they the cofers where
as the kings gold was and his silver / fair fellows keep me this vessel said
Ponthus to his seven fellows / and I will see yet if there be any yet that will
lift up the heed against us. Than lepte he out of the ship and come to the
land by a vessel / but there was none that defended him but all were slain
or drowned. Brytons herupoys Torengeaus. Manseaus / pooteuynes / and normans
ran in to the ships / and in to the vessels and the other serched the
tents and the pauylyons / and there was none so poor but that he had enough
and that one more than that other. Men serched the feldes eueryche for his
friends. And they found the vycount of Auerences deed. And Ihon^ paynell.
Turnebeef / and the lord of villyers so made the normans great sorrow for they
were good knights. And what of the Manseaus. Hongres de beaumount. Margeron /
and ye lords of doncelles. And Amaulry de sylly Of the herupois Gassos de
mountereul. Rowlande de chenulle. Ends de penaunces / and Fresylde la hay. Of
poyteuynes Gautyer de chateau neuf. Androwe de montagu and Hubault de la
forest. And other brytons. Peter de duel. Raoul le reis John^ dauauger. hardy
de leon. Huberte de dygnan. Godfrey de roham. Aubrey de rays / and many other
good knights / eueryche made their friends for too be borne in to their
country / and the hurt for to be kept. Ponthus made the great ship / and
the great tresoure for to come unto his place at vennes. And he departed great
foyson unto good knights / and unto the good folk of arms so largely / that
he was right hyghly praised and allowed therefore. The king was withdrawn
again to quypercorentyne / and there assembled al ye great lords. The king
feested the strangers / and gave them great gifts / after that every man was
of degree And than he said unto them / lords ye be come gramercy unto you / in
to gods service / and in to the service of the holy church and of the poor
people. And by the grace of the high lord and by your great prowesses and
hardynes ye have delivered this country of mysbyleuers which would have
dystroyed our holy law. And it is sothe that his purneyaunce has given you
this holy gift and this grace / for against one of you there was six of them.
So ought we with all our hertes to thank god. And after that spoke they enough
of them which had done best / and set grettest remedy and did and suffered
grettest deeds of arms but without comparyson Ponthus had the loos and said
all with one voice that he had overcome all. And so gave they the great price
unto Geffrey de lesygnen / to Androwe de la toure / and unto Bernarde de la
roche. And that they three were after Ponthus which most had suffered and
gretest deeds had done of arms / and many other there were which had done
right well / but long should it be to tell the prowess of them. Three days the
king withhelde them and feested them and gave them fair gifts to each of
them after that he was. And after that took they leave of the king. And Ponthus
conveyed them as far as he might.

How the christian men returned in their countries. And of the great chere that
Sydoyne made to Ponthus her well-beloved knight at Uennes.


ANd thus they departed fair and Joyful and every man went in to his
country. And the king turned again to vennes So needs it not to ask if
Sydoyne had great Joy / and said to Ponthus / sweet love blessed be god of the
goodness and of the honor that ye received of this battle / for so god help
me I have so great Joy of the goodness that I have herd say / that mine heart
is all led with gladness nor there is no thing that I take so great
pleasaunce in / as to here tell the great goodness and the loos that every man
gives you. Madame said Ponthus it lacks much that all is not true. Some
have said unto you and reported more than there is / such parauenture as love
me. But always I thank you of the goodness and worship that ye would me as I
think it. Madame wete it well that if god will give me grace to do some good /
that it comes to me from you / for so much only that I take me all for to
please you / and in ye hope that I have for to fall in your good grace / and
for to do you service which might please you the which god grant me to do
your worship Ponthus my sweet love your service take I in gree with all mine
heart while that I find you true without thinking of any vylanye / for our love
I will that it be clean and certain without any thought of vylanye. And wete
it well for certain that fro the time I may apperceyue that ye think any other
thing tha^ worship of me and of my friends / ye shall lose me and so much
as I love you I shall hate you to the death. Madame he said ne think never
that I would ymagyne things the which that touches against your worship. And
for that that I have found you and find it so clean / so good / and so sure
/ that I praise you and love you better a thousand times and more ardau^tly /
for a nobler tresoure is there none in ye world than is a good woman and a
clean / what should I say you / gretely loved they twain together of true love
without any vylany. but envy may not suffer things end well as ye shall here
more plainly here after following.

How that Ponthus was ordained and constytned constable of brytayne.


THe king sent to seek all his barons / and said unto them. Fair lords I
say you that I am right old and may not trauayll as I was wont / and it
needs me from hens forward to take mine ease / and therefore it is good that
by your good counseyll there be chosen a good constable that he may have the
rule and ye charge of brytayne to whom the barons of the country would best
obey without danger. So look among you one / and chose him / for I will yt he
be chosen and made by you and by your good counsyell. And than said the barons
all with one voice / We know not whom men might better find if it pleased
him to be it than Ponthus / he is worthy to govern an Empire / of bounte / of
beauty / of wit / of governance and of gentylnes as a kings sone / and as
the best begynner of knyghthode that at this day is living. When the king
hard that / he had right great Joy for that was all that he sought / but he
would not do it without that he spoke to them thereof to the end that they
should have him in the more favor and good will So was there none that
withsayd it Ponthus was cleped and it was said unto hy^ before them / all that
the king and the barons of brytayne had chosen him constable for the most
suffysaunt. So thanked he the king and the barons / and said unto them after
that he had auysed him a little / that he had not the wit the governance ne
the worthynes in him to be it / and that he was right young both of wit and
of age / but nothing auaylled them his lacking / but that he was by strength
charged wheder he would or no. So was he in his office both beloved and
dredde. And when there was any dystruccyon between the barons and the knights
/ he was he that set them again in peace / and at accord / he kept the right
of brytayne without doing any wrong / he made him to be byloued of all he
Iusted / he made feestes / he was right pleasant to great and to small / and
specially among ladies and gentelwomen / he was so curteys that there was none
did of so soon his hode against him / that his ne was done of as soon again
/ he hard the poor / and he did them right in short time of the request
where he had reason / he would not that the poor folk were oppressed / he
loved god and holy church / and herde-euery day two masses at ye leest / he
loved hawkynge and hunting and all dysportes / he made ladies and gentylwomen
to sing and to dance / all Joy was there he was he gave them dyners and
soupers / he was well beloved of fair ladies and gentylwomen which showed him
many great signs of love and drew to him greatly / but never prayed he them of
love / but that touched to their worship for any semblaunt that any of them
made. So said they between them oftentimes ye one to another She should be
blessed who should be byloued of Ponthus / and some said in pryuete / would god
he loved me as much as I would love him / and that he had me also dear as I
have hy^ much made he hy^ to be byloued of little and great. But envy which
fails never came to one of his fellows of his country / which was one of
ye.xiiii. which was meruaylous subtle of speaking and full of gile. and his
name was Guenellet.

How Guenellet put dyscencyon between Ponthus and Sydoyne.
GUenellet which saw the love of Sydoyne and of Ponthus so had he envy /
and for to make it to be left he asked of Ponthus his master an horse which
Sydoyne had given him / and he thought well that he should not mow have it /
and he said unto him Master give me the horse that Sydoyne gave you. Sothely
said Ponthus that will I not give / but go in to the stable and take which
that lies you / for there be enough fayrer than he. Sothely said he I will
have none other / if I have not him / ye may not have it said Ponthus. O said
Guenellet refufe ye to give me an horse. I ought little to trust in your good
deeds O said Ponthus suffyseth it not you for to take or to chose among all my
horses / and if ye have not enough of one take two at your own choice.
Guenelet passed forth and made him right heavy and said in his heart. I wot
well I shall not have it / but it shall be well dear bought if I live long.
So thought he malice and thought first to hinder him to Sydoyne / so went he
to go speak to a gentylwoman which was one of Sydoynes maidens / and said unto
her that he loved her right much / and that he would say her a great
counsel but that she should swear upon holy euangyles that she should not
dyscure him. And she swore unto him A said he I love well the king and his
daughter my lady and her worship / as he which has nourysshed me / and
therefore I would hold no thing which were against them. Wete it well quod he
that Ponthus my master has made my lady and yours believe that he loves her
more than any other woman of the world but wete it well yt he dodth begyle her
/ for I am well apperceyued yt he loves another more than her and yt is folly
to set her herre so on fled folk. And it is said often times / who that
would have grace over all this world many times ben deyceyued / and therefore
it is good that she take heed betymes A said the gentylwoman I had wend that
he had been the trewest yt was living / and always I am syker that he
besoughte my lady never but of honor and of goodness / I believe it well said
he / but all that shyneth is not gold The gentyl woman wend that he had said
true and went unto her lady and made her to swear that she should not dys^ure
her / and that she should make no semblaunt of that she should say unto her.
And sith she said her as it was done her to understand that Ponthus loved
another more than her / and all the manner. And when Sydoyne had herd her. It
needs not to ask if she had great sorrow in her heart what semblaunte that
ever she made / but there ne showed she none outward as she was right wise.
And it befell that Ponthus came to se her as he was wont to do of custom /
and made tho glad chere / and Sydoyne was morning and pensyfe and made him
but little chere And Ponthus was ameruayled and came to Elyos her gentylwoman
and asked her what her ayled / sothly she said I wot never but it was well a
two days agone that she was not so glad as she was went to be. And Ponthus
drew again unto her and said. Madame what chere* make ye me / have ye any
mysease / is there any thing living that I might set remedy thereto A said she
no man woteth now a days in whom he may trust to / the world is so right
meruayllous and strange for to know. Than said Ponthus unto her A Madame for
gods mercy / tell me wherefore that ye say these words / is there any body
which has mysdone against you. Nay she said / but so much I say you /
therwithall she departed and went in to her chamber right sorry and right
pensyfe. Ponthus might get none other ^hynge of her / ne have no good chere as
he was wont / so apperceyued he that he was hyndred to her by flaterynge. And
he set him in way to have wist more / but that was for naught for more ne
wyste he not at that time. That night was he right sorry and pensyfe without
sleep / and said weary and sorrowful wretch what have I said or what have I
done / who has hyndred me to my lady. Alas what is he or she that will slay
me or murthre me untruly without any deseruynge / where ben they yt would
benymme me al my worldly Joy / and make me night and day to langour sorowfully.
Thus complained him Ponthus / and if he had sorrow Sydoyne had no less than
he / and said in herself. Alas who should ever trust any man. I have be well
dysceyued / for I thought that he had been the trewest above all knights / how
has nature failed to forgete to set in the gracyousest / the best holden of
honor / of courtesye / of worthynesse / of larges / and of all good manners /
faylynge no thing but truth / How forgate she to set that in him that was
pity and harm. So sorowed the fair Sydoyne / and by this way had untruth I
set trouble between them two and the two lovers were tho in great sorrow by
such flaterynge. Ponthus which had slepte little and rested him / rose up
erly and went for to here mass / and after that he sent to seek Elyos / the
which he loved much / for that that he wyste his lady loved her much and yt
she wyste all the pryuete of her lady. A he said Elyos my sweet love much have
I meruayled of y^ that my lady said unto me / in such wise I think I never
shall have Joy. A sir she said ye ought not to do so / for I think that my
lady ne did it not but for to assaye you / or that there be some evil
reports which shall be found lesynges. So se I naught wherefore ye ought to
take such dyscomforte. A quod he my love I wot not what to think / but I
shall go out a little / and I shall not come again till I that I know yt my
coming please her. So ne said he no more at that time / and he drew him
again to his chamber and called a squire unto him which was named Gerarde /
Gerarde he said make you and two yemen and mine horse and mine harueys pryuely
ready / for two hours tofore day I will goo out a little where I shall be
nyghe one year. So leave I Harlant ye seneshal my lyeutenaunt / for he is a true
man and a good knight. Than came he to the king and said unto him that he
would go out a little. And the king said unto him. Right sweet friend go not
far / but that I may se you oftentimes / for in you is all my Joy and the
sustynaunce of all my life / and the governance of my realm. My lord he said
I think not to tarry nor to go in place yt if I wot yt ye have any thing to
do with me that touches your worship / that I ne shall come to you before all
other. Always ye king set great pain for to let his going / but he might
not in no wise So took he his leave of ye king pryuely / at even right late
that none should apperceyue hy^ / and went to rest him / and sent for
Harlant the seneshall unto his bed and said unto him. Harlant my sweet friend I
will go out a little while to know somewhat on ye world and for to acqueynte
me with good knights. So have I spoke to ye king that I shall leave you my
lyeutenaunt / and ye wot well how I love you / wherefore I pray you for my
cosyn germayne and mine other fellows. A whyder will ye go fair sweet friend.
I will go out a little while and will not dwell long / and I will that no man
wot it / and for a cause Harlant would not inquire / for he doubted not yt he
would have tarried long. And when ye Harlant was departed he made his clerks
to come forth and write two letters yt one he gave his power to Harlant / that
other he reco^maunded him to his felawshyp / and prayed them to serve well the
king / and to obey Harlant / and that he should come again from thens as he
should go to. So he left them there and took them to the clerk / and badde him
yt he should not deliver them till the next day at even / and he did yt for
dread that his fellows would have pursewed him.

How Ponthus departed from the court secretly.
ANd when it was about mydnyght / he arose up and arrayed hy^ / and parted
thens as pryuely as he might. He rode all till day / and sith went him in to
the forest of brycelyon / in a pryoury and an heremytage which was all
solytary and deep in the forest / where he was well a seven days / and every
day he went to here mass at ye heremytage. And he did much abstynau^ce as
to fast three days in the weke / and the frydaye he wered ye here / and he
thought for yt / yt the king was old / and that ye realm abode to hy^ yt he
would not be far for yt / yt if there fell any trouble yt he might remedy it.
So was he much annoyed and was at even in ye forest right pensyfe and full of
stody / and lystened ye song of the birds which was right delycyous / as in
ye time of Aueryll / and made a song where he was at ye refrayny^ge of ye
song of ye birds. No Joy should me reco^forte wha^ she which I have loved
so much / would be so strange to me / and there he set it in a song. And
sith he thought he would take an empryse of deeds ot arms. So wrote he his
ordinance and sent to seche a dwarf and made hy^ to be arrayed right well and
clothed hy^ in a robe of sylke right nobly and took hy^ a yeman and horses and
a letter written in four which said thus. The black knight with ye white arms
does to wete to ye best knights of each country / yt they shall find at ye
well of adventure in ye forest of brycelyon a black pauylyon with white teres
every tuesdaye in the year at the hour of pryme / and also they shall find a
tree where his sheldes shall hang / and there shall be an horn which a
dwarf shall blow / and wha^ he has blown it / there shall come out an old
gentylwoma^ with a sercle of gold / and an heremyte with her / which shall
say them what they shall do / she shall led the^ in a medowe where ye black
knight shall be armed / which shall Just three courses and after ye Iustes he
shall fight with a sword poyntles to the vtteraunce / and him yt he shall
conquer shall ask of all the knights in good faith the fairest maid of the
realm of little brytayne / and to her shall he yield hy^ prisoner to do her
will with him on the sorrowful black knights behalf with ye white teres. And
over that it is to be known that all they that have Iusted shall yield them
in this forest at wytsontyde come twelve month at a feast which shall be
therein. And he which that shall Just best / shall have the spear the guffanon
/ and a sercle of gold with stones. And he which shall smite strongest with
the sword and longest fight / shall have the sword with the gyrdell of gold
and the crown of gold / and if it befall that any of them conquer the
black knight he shall mow send him to prison to such a lady as shall please
him.

How Ponthus sent a dwarf thrughe all ye country of France to anounce and
show of deeds of arms that should be made in the forest of betelyen every
tuesdaye thrughe the year.


ANd wha^ Ponthus had taken these letters to the dwarf / he commanded him
yt he should go by all the countries of France / there where he wyste any
assemble of feestes or Iustes / and that he do them to wete all about. The
dwarf which that could speak right well / went by all the country doing
them to wete / and many one meruaylled wherefore the black knight would fight
so. And for that that he chose the best knights of every country / and many
one made them ready to come thither / and said that he should have great worship
that he should have the sword or ye spear / and yet more who should mow
conquer him it tarried not long that there came thither enough of brytayne and
of other countrees. And Ponthus made his folk swear / the pryour / and the
heremyte all that they should not dyscure him. And he sent to Rennes the
which was before named vile ronge to seek that that him neded. And he sent to
seek an old gentylwoman which should be of his counseyll / and arrayed her in
cote and in mantell of sylke / and a large sercle of gold upon her heed / and
had a kercher of almayne tofore the vysage that men should not know her. And
Ponthus was disguysed in manner of an heremyte with a great heed of here / and
white berde and a vyser / and had in his hand a letter of the ordinance. And
at that tuesday there came many knights wenynge to have Iusted and to have do
deeds of arms to the black knight which was at the well / and some men
called it the well of brylaunson. And saw pyght a great tent and a great
pauylyon / and it tarried not long that a dwarf came out of the pauylyon right
foul and horye / and came to a tree where henge a great horn / and the black
shield with the white terys / and took the horn and blewe right strongly / and
when he had blown it / out came the gentylwoman and the heremyte which held
her by the brydell of gold / and came right to ye shield / and made the dwarf
to cry that the knyghts of every country which would do deeds of arms with
the black knight should hang up their sheldes at that great tree where the
speres were about. And there were little hokes of yren where every man might
hang his shield / every man that was there made his shield for to be hanged
there. And when the sheldes were hanged the dwarf said / this gentylwoma^
which is here does me to say to you what her ordinance is / that she shall
chose among all these sheldes four sheldes / to which she shall shote to
each an arowe federed with gold. And that that she shall smite first shall go
to array him for this tuesdaye. And that where she shall shote to the second
arowe / shall make him ready by that day seven night. And he that of the third
/ shall make him ready for the third tuesdaye. And yt where she shall smite the
fourth arowe / shall make him ready for the fourth tuesday. And at the end of
the month she shall shote again other four by the same semblaunce / and so
shall she do for every month from this time to the end of the year / and
there shall be fyfty knights / and two which shall deliver of the best / and
of the most renowned that that gentylwoman shall mow chose at her deuyse and
shall dure from this time all ye year / or so much that he find who to
conquer him by arms. And when the dwarf had said that he entered in to the
pauylyon all on horsbacke. And brought with him a meruayllous fair bow of
turquye / and four arowes gylte / and federed with gold to the gentylwoman /
and told her which she should smite. So Sotte she the four arowes / and
smote four sheldes / whereof ye first was Bernarde de la roche the best
knight of all brytayne hold. The second was Geffrey de Lesygnen hold ye best
of poytow. The third was Androwe de la toure hold the best of aungeuynes and
herupoys. The fourth was the Earl of Mortaygne hold ye best of the normans
that were there.

How Ponthus conquered first Bernarde de la roche / and sent him unto the
fair Sydoyne for to yield him prisoner.


ANd when she had shot these four arowes the heremyte led her again to
the great tente which was black with white teres / and anon he alyght down
and armed him at all points and came out of the tente / the shield at his
neck / and the spear in his fyste upon a great black horse / covered all with
black syglaton with white teres right rychely armed. The knight was great and
well shapen and much was for to be doubted. Much wondering and much lokynge
was there at that time upon hy^ and much meruayllynge the strangers what that
he was / for the common voice was that Ponthus was gone in to the realm of
Poullain / and of Hungary to a war which was there / wherefore none ne wist
that it was he. It tarried not long that Bernarde de la roche which had ye
first arowe in his shield: came right nobly armed / with great foyson of
trumpes / and taboures with such a sown that all men meruaylled. The knight
took a cup of gold and put it in the well and wette the stone withal / and
the water sprange a broad / and it began to thonder and to hayle / and to be a
strong tempest / but it dured not long / and much meruaylled the strangers
of that well / for always he spryncled it tofore yt he went to fight. Sith
took he his horse again / and his helm on his heed / and took his spear and
smote his horse with ye spores toward Bernarde / and Bernarde to him / and
gave him together so great strokes yt they brake their sheldes / and passed over
and came again / and smote together in such wise that Bernarde and his horse
fell / but Bernarde sterte upon his fete / and when the black knight saw him
on foot / he alyght and ran upon him with his sharp sword of stele / and
gave him great strokes where he might take him / and Bernarde defended him to
his power / but Ponthus smote so great strokes / and so hard / that he bette
down what that ever he took / and so much that he smote so great a strote
that he bette thauentayll of his helm / and all the sercle / and hurt him a
little in ye vysage / and Bernarde lift up his sword and smote Ponthus / but
Ponthus cast his shield to fore him / and the stroke fell upon the shield /
entered in half a foot / and in such wise that he might not have out his
sword again so strongly it held. And Ponthus apperceyued that drew the
shield to him with so great strength so much that the dwerfe and all together
came at ones. And wha^ Bernarde saw yt he was without sword / he was right
evil at ease. And Ponthus said unto him. Sir knight it is time yt ye go in to
ye fairest ladies mercy of this realm / and Bernarde answered never a word as
he that was angry. And Ponthus said unto him / sir knight never and god will
shall I do no thing to you when I se ye have no thing to defend you with. Than
Bernarde came and wend to have taken hy^ with his fystes. And Ponthus which was
great and strong / he manfully took him by ye helm / and he drew him to him
felly / yt he made hy^ to fall upon his hands to the earth / and had him down
under him / and said unto hy^. I shall let you go unto ye fairest
gentylwomannes prison / and salve her on ye black knights behalf. And so he
withdrewe him / and Bernarde saw well the debonayrte of the black knight /
and praised him much / and came to ye knights which beheld the battle and
said unto them / fair lords I have found my master. Never afor ne found I
so hard a knight / ne so curteys / ne so strong. So ask I you yt ye tell me
which is ye fairest gentylwoman of this realm and they held them to Sydoyne
ye knyges daughter and she had the voice of them all / and he departed than to
go to Uennes. Ponthus lepte upon his horse and smote him with the spores / and
went in to the forest / as fast as the horse might go by certain ways which
yt he knew / so yt none ne wyste where he became / and came to ye pryoury and
entered in and closed ye gates after hy^ and alyght and unarmed hy^. And ye
gentylwoman and the dwarf / and all other with vysers abode in ye pauylyons till
that it was night. And when that all people were withdrawn and done they came
their way. So here leave I of them and return again unto Sydoyne and
Bernarde de la Roche. Sydoyne was both day and night in great sorrow and
vnhertes ease / for when her gentylwoman had told her how Ponthus had said
unto her that he would goo a little while out of that country. So she thought
that it was for the evil chere that she had made him / tho she repented her
right sore / and bewaylled her self oftentimes and said. Alas caytyfe now
have I lost him by my great folly / shamed be they that brought me first such
tidings / for I se well and know that if it were not for fere that he had
that I should have be wroth with him he would not have left the country. It
was unto me great folly for to put in doubt that his sweet heart should not
have be trewer than any other / than she wept and sorowed in her heart for
very fere that she should have lost him so she sorowed day and night. There
were many great complayntes in the court for the going away of Ponthus. The
king was heavy and might have no rest and oftentimes wysshed after him / and
so did his cosyn germayne and all his fellows / and all manner of people both
great and small / and the court was in great heaviness for him. It was but
little while after that Bernarde de la Roche came unto court and asked fair
Sydoyne saying that he was her prisoner / the king sent for her and she came
with a great foyson of ladies and of gentylwomen / and their assembled knights
and all manner of people both great and small to here the lord la roche
Bernarde. And wha^ she was come down in to the hall / tho Bernarde kneled
down to her and spoke on high yt al men might here hy^ and said. Madame to
you sends me ye black knight with the white teres the which by his
worthynesse has conquered me in arms and bad me yt I should yield me prisoner
to ye fairest gentylwoman of this realm. So have I inquired of all the
knights and squyers yt were there which was the fairest / and they all held
them to one voice to you. So yield I me to you and in to your prison as your
knight / and ye to have power to do as of your own / and yet he bad me yt I
should salewe you from hy^. Sydoyne wexed reed and was asshamed by cause ye men
held her ye fairest. Trewly said she I thank them all / but they have symply
aduysed me. And I thank the knight yt sent you hyder / but tell me if ye wot
fro whens he is. Truly said he madame nay. O said ye king may no man know
what he is / truly no said Bernarde / but so much I say you he is the
goodlyest knight armed yt ever I saw / and the best can smite both with spear
and with sword. And me seems yt he is somewhat more tha^ was Ponthus and he is
much like hy^ / but it is not he / for men say yt he is in ye realm of
poulayne or in hu^gary at ye wars which ben there. There was much speky^ge
of ye black knight / and how yt he should ye next tuesdaye fight with Geffrey
de lesygnen / and with Androwe de la toure on ye other tuesday and than after yt
with ye Earl of mortayne. The king and all ye ladies made great chere unto ye
lord de la roche / and they did ete all together in the hall with the king at
mete. Sydoyne bourded with Bernarde and said tho unto him / lord de la roche I
am right Joyful to have such a prisoner as ye be. So ye ought to have great
doubt of the prysonynge that ye shall have to suffer. And Bernarde began for
to smyle and said. Madame if ye show me none harder prysony^ge tha^ this is I
shall suffer it well. And wete it well as I thy^ke or this year be passed / ye
shall have more largely / and so shall I not be allone. After dinner began the
daunces and the karolles / but Sydoyne dau^ced but a little / and yet would she
have daunced less ne had been for fere ye men should have perceived her /
sorrow.

How Ponthus conquered Geffrey de Lelygnen and sent him unto Sydoyne.


THe day fair and clear and the lord of Lesygnen / the which was a
meruayllous good knight was armed and on horsbacke and came before the
fountain. And ye black knight lepte out of his pauylyon his spear in his
hand / and ye shield about his neck and as soon as each of them saw other /
they let their horses run gyuy^ge great strokes with their speres So that
both horses fell upon their arses / and almoost all was overthrown.
Nevertheless they rose again and took other speres great and strong and
sharp / and they afferred each from other / and came again as fast as their
horses might drive for to Just ye one against ye other / and gave so great
strokes on ye sheldes yt all ouerthrewe both knights and horses / and was so
rudely yt the horse of Geffrey fell ye heed under the body and might not stere
neither knight nor horse / for Geffrey had his leg and his thygh under ye horse
/ and was right sore bruised. But ponthus rose again upon his horse / and yet
he was sore ashamed yt he was overthrown. So looked he on the knight yt might
not stere from under his horse / than he alyght and came to ye knight and did
so much yt he drew him from under his horse / and he had his foot out of
Ioynte / and so he might not stand but upon one foot / and yet he laid his
hand on his sword as he yt was of great heart and great hardynesse. And wha^
Ponthus saw yt he might not stand but upon one foot / he would not smite him
but let him smite a stroke or two / and said unto him. Sir knight I se you in
a simple party / and shame it were for me for to assail you. And geffrey said
wherefore I hold me not overcome as long as I may hold my sword in my hand
/ and wha^ he wend to stryke Ponthus he met with a stone with his foot which
made him for to overthrow. And when Ponthus saw yt he did help hy^ for to
rise again. And said unto him. Sir knight and if ye were hole I would run
upon you / but I se well your disease / and ye shall not yield you to me / but
to the fairest gentylwoman of all brytayne yt which shall take you to her
mercy / and salewe her from the black knight / so I pray you that we do no
more than we have done / for I wot well if ye were in good estate ye would not
leave me so hole as ye have letfte me / for I know well your worthynesse of
time passed. And when Geffrey saw the debonayrete and great bounte of the
black knight he praised him much and said. Sir I shall go where yt it
pleases you to command me. And if I wyste that it should not displease you I
would ask you your name. And ponthous answered hy^ again Sir ye nor none
other shall wete it at this time. And Geffrey held him still and would no more
enquere. And ponthus took his leave of him and went his way pryuely in to the
forest by the paths as he was wont to do. So the people that saw the battle
meruayled much and said. Right curteys is the black knight have ye not seen
his debonayrete and his great gentylnes how he would help him up. Much they
praised him and gave him great loos. So they came to Geffrey de lesygnen that
might not bestere him. So he said unto Androwe de la toure / fair friend and
fellow I shall abide till the next tuesdaye coming for to hold you
felawshyppe for to goo unto the fair Sydoyne if ye set no better remedy in
you that I have done in me. Sir said Androwe de la toure / of ye adventure of
arms may no man Judge / for they be right meruayllous / and ye might not do
thereto of this adventure / for it was befall of your horse whereof no man may
beware. And I think not for to have shame if I pursewe such knights as ye
and Bernarde de la Roche. So they spoke of many diverse things / and so he
was taken and lift up as softely as men might / and was led unto Mou^tfort /
where yt he was dyght yt he might ride with a palet.

How ye third tuesdaye Ponthus conquered landry and sent him unto Sydoyne.
THe next tuesdaye came from every part people to se the battle / at the
hour of pryme the black knight with ye white teres came / and of ye other
side came landry / and than they cast their speres in the restes with ye
guffanons hanging and with great Ire each of them smote other without
ouerthrowynge / so they passed forth and came again right rudely / so much
that they persed their sheldes and brake their speres / and than they took
their swerdes / and each gave other great strokes where they might reche. So
they were a great while on horsbacke / and so befell that Ponthus dressed hy^
well and smote landry wtall his strength that he made him astonyed / and when
Ponthus had do so he saw him staker / so he took him by the helm and drew
him with all his strength so yt he cast him to ye earth / but nevertheless he
rose up again / and when Ponthus saw him at the earth / he said that he should
not assail hy^ on horseback and ye other on foot / for it should turn him
to shame / but anon he alyght and put his shield tofore him / and his sword
in his hand / and came rennynge upon hy^. And Landry dressed him and made him
ready to defend him / for he wist well he had not a do with a child / and
Ponthus came and smote hy^ a stroke and the sword glaunced / and smote away a
quarter of his shield and landry smote hy^ again great strokes / where he might
reche him / and right well he defended him to his power like a good knight /
for he was meruaylously strong / hard and manly / so he endured much.
Ponthus gave hy^ great strokes where he might hit him. So he meruaylled much
how he might endure against him so long. So they brake their sheldes / and
their helmes / and they were so weary at the first assaute that they must needs
rest them / and to take their brethes / and they lened upon their swerdes for
werynesse. And than Androwe spoke first and said. Sir knight I wot not what ye
be / but so much I say you yt I wend not in the morning to have found so
much strength and worthynes in you as I have proved / but before or ye have
conquered me in arms ye must do more than ye have done yet / ye said Ponthus
by the holy faith ye shall yield you to the fair gentylwoman / or mine heart
lies / and bear her this gift of this sword Than he lift up his sword / and
smote Androwe as he which had great anger and shame that he endured so long
against him. And so began the battle so hard that the blood ran from them
down to the ground. And Ponthus had given him a great stroke upon the
temple / so that his helm was broken / so turned he his shield / and took his
sword with both his hands and smote Androwe so great a stroke that he was
all astonyed / and it was no meruayll for right long had the battle endured
between them both yt with great pain they might stand. So often he smote him
that he apperceyued well that Androwe was weary and astonyed of strokes that he
had given and received / and so he hasted him more and more so much that he
saw him staker / so he came and put him with all his might / and cast him
down and fell both to the earth / but Ponthus fell upon him so yt Androwe
might not rise / and Ponthus said unto hy^. Sir knight yield you / and Androwe
said no word / and endured much pain and had great sorrow to yield him. So
said he to hy^ again as he which was right courteys. Sir knight yield you to
the fair gentylwoman I pray you and that there be no more debate between you
and me / for we have preued us enough together. And than Androwe knew well the
great courtosye of the knight which that he faught with / and said unto him /
to her shall I yield me gladly sith that it pleases you. It suffyseth me said
Ponthus / and than he rose up right weary / and much trauayled of the great
strokes and of the great battle that had so long endured / so he came to his
horse with much pain and lepte up and went in to the forest where he saw the
thyckest so fast that every man lost the sight of him. And Geffrey de
lesygnen and many other came to Androwe and asked how he did and he said well
after the disease that he had / but that he had found his master. A said
Geffrey fair friend we shall go you and I together to the right fair lady and
we shall yield us to her mercy. Sir said Androwe I shall bear you felawshyp /
for it were no reason that ye should go without me. And so bourded that one
felawe with ye other. So he was unarmed and had great foyson of wounds / but
he stood in no danger / for he had no wound that might let hy^ to ride. So
went they on the third day after to yield them to fair Sydoyne. And the
king made them great chere and great Joy as to two of the best knyhgtes
that men might find in any land / and most named of worthy knyghthode. So
they came to Sydoyne / and put them in to her mercy. And she which was right
wise and gentle received them with great Joy / and fested them and did them
great worship / and gave them mantelles of sylke furred with veer and gyrdelles
fair and rich / and on every gyrdell a rich gypsyer and the knights thanked
her / and said well was befall them of her prison / and that she was not hard
for to endure. Lords said she I wot not who is ye knight that sends you
hyder but he and ye do me right great worship without cause for fayrer and
goodlyer ben enough in this realm who that will seche them and chose them.
Madame said choknyghtes we must believe the common / for all have the sen you for
the fairest. So they bourded enough of many things / and abode there two
days yt one with the king that other with her after yt she gave them leave. So
they departed for goo se the battle of the earl of mortayne which was a right
good knight.



How the fourth tuesday Ponthus conquered Thybault de bloys earl of mortayne
and sent him as ye other and also of other knights on tuesdaye ensewynge.
SO the old gentylwoman / and the dwarf came out of ye pauylyon and had a
bow turkoys and her four arowes as ye have herd before / and the heremyte
with the vyser led her by the brydell / and made her sign to which she
should shote as at for that month. And the old gentylwoman smote first in ye
shield of Thybault de bloys / the which was named for a good knight. And the
other arowe in the shield of damp Martyne. The third arowe in the shield of
Henry de mount maurency / and the fourth arowe was in the shield of Roberte de
resyllyon. These were the four knights most named of whom that the sheldes
of their arms were hanged up / and when she had shote her four arowes she
withdrewe her to the pauylyon. And anon after the black knight came out armed
with all his arms / his shield about his neck the spear in his hand. And on
the other side came in Thybault the earl of mortayne right rychely arrayed with
great foyson of trumpettes and taboures. And as soon as each of them saw
other / they let their horses run and gave great strokes. But Ponthus
reuersed so the earl that he had almoost beten him down unto the ground. So
they set hand upon their swerdes / and each of them ran upon an other
right rudely / but Ponthus smote so mighty strokes and so hard that he kerued
a two all that ever he hit the Earl defended him to his power. So endured the
battle right long / but Ponthus which was great and strong took him by the
helm and drew him so sore that he rent it from him and threw it to to the
ground. And than abode in his coyfet of yren on which he gave him a great
stroke saying unto him that he should yield him / but he smote him not with
the cuttynge. And the earl endured much but needs he must yield him whyther
he would or not. So he badde him yield him to the fairest lady of Brytayne So
he departed and went in to the forest as he did before. And the earl went
and yield him unto fair Sydoyne as the other knights did which did him
great worship / and so did her fader the king. The next tuesdaye faught
Tybault de bloys / and so all the other till the years end after following.
But it were to long taryenge to tell the Iustes and the bataylles that every
man did in that month and in all the other months and in all the other
months following / for there were many fair Iustes and great bataylles / and
many noble deeds of arms / the which should be to long for to tell who that
would rehers them all. But the end was that they were all overcome in arms /
and sent in to the prison of fair Sydoyne. So they were two and fyfty
knights prisoners of the best that men might find in any lands for to
conquer worship. Every man herd and saw that the good knights went to
assaye themself / and that he chose always the best that men might find to do
deeds of arms Every man desired for to be of ye nombre for to assaye them
against him. And so great was the voice and the renown ran thrughe france
almayne / and by all other countrees / that all knights came and henge up
their sheldes. So there came many of the realm of france and of other realms
and countrees. And Ponthus chose always by worthynes the best and faught but
with one of every country because his name should go the ferther. So was there
of the nombre of the two and fyftye. The duke of Osteryche / the duke of
Lorayne / the Earl of baar / the earl of Mountbelyart / the earl of mou^fort /
and other dukes and earls. Sir Wylyam of bayrs. Sir Arnolde of henaude / the
earl of Sauoye / and other diverse good knights / so leave I of their names
for it were over long to tell / and so I torn again for to abredge my matter
/ so that it befell yt whytsontyde was come at the years end that all ye
prisoners came for to yield them there as it was ordained. Ponthus did make a
great halle covered with leaves / and a fair grene fast by the fou^tayne of
meruaylles that men called Belenson. And sent for all manners of mete and wynes
and for all manner of stuff and tha^ he wrote unto the king of Brytayne
saying. The black knight with the white teeres with all humylyte and honor most
mekely reco^maundeth him unto your most noble and excellent grace. The black
knight besecheth you mekely that it please your highness for to be at this
feast of Pentecost in the forest of brici^iun at the fountain of meruaylles
with the fairest ladies and ge^tylwomen that is in all your realm. And also yt
it pleases you not to forgete my lady your daughter for to se and counsayll to
whom ye price shall be given / that is to him the which has best Iusted and
myghtyest foughten of the two and fyghty knights / for every tewesdaye of the
year. When the king had seen the lettres he had right great Joy / and said
that the black knight had done him great worship / and yt there should he be /
and than he sent for his daughter / and told her the tidings that was sent
him. And charged her for to send for the fairest ladies and gentylwomen of his
realm to come unto her at ye Penthecost. And fair daughter ye ought for to
do it for ye knight has done you great worship that by his sword has sent
in to your prison so many good knights and lords whereof great worship is fall
unto you and also unto your realm for the which I am much beholdynge unto ye
black knight. Fair Sydoyne kneled down and said sith that it pleases you I
shall do your commandment. So she did write lettres unto ye great ladies of
Brytayne that they should be with her the frydaye before whytsondaye And that
they should bring in their company the fairest ladies and gentylwomen that men
might find. The ladies that herd the maundemente of Sydoyne they had great
Joy and made them ready and came to that Journey. And there was a great
assemble. So they came upon whytsondaye to the fou^tayne with their tents and
pauylyons / and they were pyght there about that they seemed as it were a great
host. Ponthus came against the king. And he had sent the day tofore.xiii.
gowns of a suit to his xiii. fellows / and one to herlaunt ye senesshall /
because that they should bear him fellowship. It needs not to ask if his cosyn
germayne and his fellowship had great Joy of the worship that god had sent him
and when they king wist yt it was Ponthus yt had done so much in arms it
needs not to ask ye Joy he had of it and the chere yt he made him / and
colled him and kyssed him / and than he said unto him / ye have long hyd you
from us / and men said that ye were in hungary and in poullayne at wars / yt
were there but in good faith mine heart told me that it was ye that did such
meruaylles. Ponthus wexed read and said nothing for he was ashemed that the
king praised him so much.

How Ponthus made to make a conuys and made to be given unto every knight after
as they had deserved.


AFter that he went against Sydoyne yt was accompanied with many fair ladies.
And salewed her mekely / and she yielded him again his salutacyon / as she that
had all Joy yt heart might think / and than she said unto hy^ in smiling O
Ponthus ye have hyd you long time from us in this forest I doubt me yt ye be
become an ermyte and wild. A madame said he save your grace I am easy to tame.
And than he departed from her as he that was all taken in the love of his lady
that of long time he had not seen her And than he went too se the ladies the
which were all dysguysed with grene bows and garlondes / and he said unto
them. My ladies I pray god that each of you have that yt your hertes desire /
for in good faith it is a good sight to se so fair a company. The ladies
yielded him his salutacyon / the which were full of Joy for to se him for they
loved him meruayllously well above all knights. And the one said to another It
is Ponthus the good and fair knight thanked be god of the great worship that
he has sent him and I pray god that he will keep him us as the best knight
of the world / and this was there speech far and nere. So they arrived at
the fountain both ye king and the ladies / with great Joy. And on that
other side came the knights strangers. The king and the ladies made them
great Joy. And there was great sown and noise of diverse manners of my^stralsy
so that all the wode ronge of it. And the king and ponthus did great worship
to the dukes and lords / as to the duke of Ostrytche of Lorayne and of baar /
and to the earl of dampmartyn of Sauoye of mou^tbelyart and to other diverse
great lords. So they went and herd mass that the bishop of Rennz sange /
after that they came to the halle. And the king / the dukes and Sydoyne were
set at the high dese / and after every man after as he was. Great was the
feast and great was the hall / and on the side were hanged the.lii. sheldes of
the knights conquered Right strange and fair things were made between the
courses as armed children that fought together / and diverse other things / and
six old knights / and six old squyers / some bare the spear and the
gouffanon black with the white teeres of great margaretes and oryente perles /
and a rich cercle of gold meruayllously wrought of rich perles and of good
stones. The other bare the rich sword with the pomel of gold / And the
gyrdell of sylke wrought with gold and great margaretes and perles / and with
precious stones that it was a fair sight to se. And this richesse had ponthus
won in the ship of the Soudans sone. So he said himself that he might no better
beset them than before so many notable princes and great lords / for he showed
all his deeds right honorably. The knights and ye ladies went about the
halle singing as though they wyste not to whom they should present them.
And than they came before the lord de Lesygnen and presented him the spear and
the ffouffanon and the rich cercle of gold ye which they set upon his head /
for ye best Iuster. And after they came to Androwe de la toure and presented
him the rich sword and the rich crown set upon his heed / whyther he would
or no for he excused himself much and wend to have refused it saying that
they did him worship that he had not deserved and that there were diverse
other that had better won it than he had and he wexed read and was ashamed /
but Ponthus had so ordained it for he said in good faith that he had yeuen
him most a do as for one day. Also Geffrey had right well Iusted. Than
began mynstrelles for to play of all manner of mynstrelsy and also the
herauldes began to cry that men should not have herd thondrynge / for all ro^ge
both wood and forest of the noise. There was given many diverse meases and
good wynes and also great yeftes unto heraudes and mynstrelles. Ponthus came
behind the king and said to him in his ere. Sir and it please you we shall do
cry the Iustes against to morrow / and on tewesdaye at Uennes because yt ye
should know these princes / and these dukes / for it shall be your worship.
A said ye king in good faith it is a good and a true counseyll and I pray
you that it be done. Than Ponthus called an heraude and made him to cry that
the white knight with the read rode shall be this mondaye and tewesdaye in ye
cite of Uennes with five fellows and himself shall make the syxte for to
withstand all manner of knights with speres. And he that shall have the price
on ye mondaye without forth shall have the gyrdell and the gypsere of ye
fairest of the feast. And he that does best on the tewesdaye shall have the
sparohawke mewed with the loins of perles and margarytes / and a chapelet that
the fairest of the feast shall give him. And he of the ynner party that shall
Just best shall have a ring of the fairest.

How Ponthus made a Iustes to be cried in the cite of Uennes and how he smote
down the strongest that he recountred.
ON ye morrow after they departed by times / and went and herd mass at saint
peter's of Uennes / and than they went and dyned / and after dinner the king
and the ladies went to the schalfoldes. And than came Ponthus and his horse al
white with a great read rose that betokened his lady / and his five fellows of
the which one was Bernarde de la Roche / the vycount of Lion / the vycount of
donges. Polydes and Herlaunt ye senesshall all good knights. The Iustes were
great on the mondaye and on the tewesdaye there were many great Iustes and many
great strokes given. But over all knights Ponthus Iusted best for he beat
down knights and horses / and did such meruaylles yt every knight doubted to
mete with him so he set both heart and will because yt his lady was there present
/ both great and small praised him much / the ladies said se him come yt
beteth all down before him He is a great fool that gooth against him / his
spear spares no man but yt he hurts him or felleth him. Sydoyne saw well
that the ladies and all other preysed him she said no word but kept her self
close that no man should apperceyue that she had more Joy of him than of
another how much that her heart had all manner of Joy. Right well Iusted the
duke of Of trytche and he of Loreyne the earl of Sauoye the earl of
mountbelyart and many other but it were to long to tell. And all the good
Iusters / on the monday and on the tewesdaye were right worshypfully feested.
At ye souper on the tewesdaye the feast was great and large they gave the price
on the mondaye of the utter party to the earl of mountbelyart right a good
knight and he had the gyrdell and the Gypsere of Sydoyne because that she was
chosen for the fairest of the feast The price of without on the tewesdaye was
yeuen to the duke of Ostryche. So had he the sparohawke with the rich
loins and the chapelet of Sydoyne / Ponthus had the price on mondaye as of
within. And he would that the price upon tewesdaye within should have been given
unto the lord de la Roche the which had best Iusted of all the other save
oonly Ponthus the which no man might come nere by fer The ladies sent a ring
with a great Rubye unto Ponthus. And an ouche right rich unto Bernarde lord
de la Roche / Heraude and mynstrelles led great Joy and great noise. After
souper they carolled and daunsed / and sange songs till mydnyght / and than
they drank and ete spyces. And after that the strangers took their leave of
the king and of Sydoyne and of the great ladies. And they departed on
wednesdaye by times when they had herd mass and Ponthus conveyed the^ to ye
castle of gyron where he had ordained them a dinner / and after dinner he would
have conveyed them ferther / but the lords would not suffer him / and yet he
offered himself right much unto them / and so they took their leave that one
of that other. The lords both great and small they praised much Ponthus of
his good felawshyp and of his good chere / and that trewly he was the goodlyest
knight and the best and the most gracyous of the world at their advise / and
that there was none like him / and also they praised much Sydyone of her
beauty and of her curtesye and that he that should have her should be well
eurous. And Ponthus turned again to the king and to the ladies. After dinner
the ladies and the knights of Brytayne took their leave of the king and of his
daughter. The king and his daughter came singing and sporting them toward
syclynere. On a time Sydoyne and Ponthus spoke together. So said Sydoyne unto
Ponthus ye have hyde you long time from us / and I meruaylled much that I
herd none other tidings from you. Madame said he I sent you every weke a
messanger Ye say troth sweet friend said she / ye sent me the most notable
messangers that might be found. Nevertheless it would have done me great
pleasure to have wist who had sent them sith that they came from you for every
man said ye were in hungary. And also I meruaylled much that ye did me none
otherwise to wete of your going away / and therefore mine heart was in right
great disease. A madame he said I was here nyghe you that were in my heart and
in my thought and all yt ever I did I thought to do it for your love and for
to increase your good renown / for I wist well that ye should be chosen for
the fairest of Brytayne / and so I have done so much that the best knights
that men know of each country be come for to se you and to put them in your
mercy. But for all that madame in good faith it was not I that did it it was
ye madame / wherefore I thank you for the power and the hardynesse ye gave me /
for of my self I durst not have undertake it. Ponthus said she I wot well
that this goodness and worship comes to you from god and from none other /
but that is for that ye love god and dread he has given you the grace and the
hardynesse / and the strength so ye ought for to thank him hyghly. Madame he
said so do I / but I think well that the enterprise came from you. Now
Ponthus said she leave we this talking for in good faith ye gretest Joy mine
heart may have is for to here good tidings of you as long as I find you
true for the worship of me and of my lord / madame said he of that be ye
certain / for I have lever to be deed than think other wise by my faith. Upon
this talking arrived Guenelet one of ye.xiiii. felawes.

How Ponthus was accused to the king by Guenellet yt was amerous of Sydoyne
his daughter.
THis Guenellet was right enuyous and a fair speker and a great flaterer. So
had he great envy at his master and had so great sorrow that any should be
more master in the court than he. So saw the king was old and aged / and
he thought that by fair speech and flaterynge he would be master / and he
thought to put out and estraunge his master which was the preuyest with ye
king / and to do him treason. So he saw the king alone in the wood where as
he hunted and said unto him. I shall tell you a great counseyll / so that ye
will swear upon kings words that ye shall not dyscure me. I shall swear it to
you said the king which was all good and true and mystrusted him in no
thing. My right dredefull lord said Guenellet ye have nourysshed me and made
me / and all the good that I have is of your well doing / and therefore ought
I for to have you better than other fader and mother or all the world / so
may not my heart suffer your damage nor dysworshyp / and therefore will I tell
you a thing which touches gretely against your worship. How much that I
love Po^thus more than any man save only you. So would I suffer no thing that
should be against your worship. Sir it is thus that Ponthus loves my lady your
daughter / and therefore be ye well aduertysed / for he is a right good knight.
So I have doubt that some folly love may fall between them / whereof she and ye
might have great shame and dishonor. A said the king Guenellet I se well that
ye love me right well / and that ye would not be glad of my dysworshyp so am I
right much beholdynge to you for ever more and I thank you gretely. And thus
thanked him the king as he yt wend that he had said troth. And said
Guenellet ye ought not to thank me for I hold me so much bound unto you
that there is no thing yt any erthly man might do for his lord but that I
would do it for you only to dye for to alength your life if it need were. But
sir I tell you how ye shall preue hy^ / if he say that he loves her not bydde
him swear and make an oath / and ye shall se perauenture that he will not. Now
Guenellet had herd say of Ponthus in the parties of Galyce and of spain a
kings sone should make none oath of thing yt were put upon him as long as he
might fight therefore / and if he did he should be dysworshypped / and therefore
told he this to the king / for he wyste well yt he would make none oath / and
by that way he would set the king and him at dystau^ce / and for to estrau^ge
him from the country for to have the more rule gadered in to his own hand /
for an enuyous man may no thing suffer. The king was all pensyfe and angry of
these tidings as he which loved his daughter meruaylously well was aferde to
have dyshonoure. When he was come fro ye wode and alyght of his horse. Ponthus
which was there came tofore him wenynge to have taken his sword and his
gloves as he had done before of customs / but the king turned him from him
ward and made no semblau^t to him nor to speak to him / when Ponthus
apperceyued it he wyste well yt the king was dyspleased with him / so went
he to him and said / sir how is it that ye are dyspleased with me for gods
love tell me what I have forfayted. Ha said the king which was right angrye.
Ponthus. Ponthus I have made little nourture of you when ye have auysed you for
to dishonor me / how sir said Ponthus by what way By that way said ye king
that ye love my daughter for to dyshonoure her. And I have no child but her
and she is all my Joy and all the lengthynge of my life Sir said Ponthus who
told you so / if there be any that dare say it now I am ready for to preue it
with my body that he lies falsely save your honor. Nay said the king if ye
will swear upon holy gospels that ye love her not as I have said / parauenture
I will believe you. Sir for to say that I love her not as I owe to love the
daughter of my ryghtfull lord I say not the contrary / but that I would do
thing or think that should touch the dysworshyp of her or of you I shall
answer as a true knight ought to do / and sir ye wot well ye ought not to
ask me none other thing to my worship / for ye wot well enough that a
kings sone ought not to make none oath of no thing that were put upon him
as long as he might defend him with his body And that is the usage of the
country where I was borne I wot never said ye king which was right fell and
angry of the words that he had herd. Sir said Ponthus yet will I offer you
more that I will fight with two or three if there be any that will mayntene it /
for I feel my quaryll so good and so clean that I am all in certain that god
shall help me as a true Judge. A said the king ye hold yourselfe so strong
and so knyghtly yt ye wot well there dare none fight with you. A sir said
Ponthus I offer you all that ever I may with my worship profre. The king
passed forth and said ye battle should not be done as for y^ d^de.

How Ponthus took leave of the fair Sydoyne.


When Ponthus saw that he was right sorrowful and angry because yt he was a
kings sone he was sorry for to make an oath yt it should torn him to dishonor
and to reprefe / and on the other side because the king would do him no right
/ So he came to the king and took his leave of him / and said unto him that he
would not dwell in his court in mysbyleue nor in suspeccyon and thus departed
he and came unto Sydoyne and told her how the king had said unto him / and
how he had offered for to fight with two or three and how that the king would
do him no right / and would make him to be sworn to his dysworshyp. And when
Sydoyne understood this it needs not to ask if she had great sorrow and said.
A god which ben these false tryatours flaterers that so great untruth and
lesynges have contryued for by my faith I dare swear in god that in our love
was never uncleanly thought. But thus it is that envy may never deye. Madame
said he by my faith ye say troth. But I will take my leave of you with as
great sorrow and heaviness as ever took knight of his lady. A said she sweet
love ye were better to make the oath for ye may do it surely and to put away
all blame. A madame said he never should I dare be seen in the country where I
was borne. And never god will that I be the first of kings sons that should
make an oath / for it should be a reprefe to mine heirs for ever more. Madame
how much that the body go the from you a while I shall be with you at the
seven years end / and I be a live / if sooner I come not / wherefore I pray you
and if it please you to keep you from maryenge unto that time and ye may. A
said she how the term is set long / and I shall be the while so sorrowful and
shall have so many heavy days and sorrowful hours to suffer. At these words
she was all vanysshed and fell in a swowne. They had both their hertes so
heavy that with great pain they might speak. save only that they embrased each
other / and the teres fell down fromr their eyes. And Ponthus put his hatte
before his eyes and departed and went to his chamber and shytte the door to
him / and than his heart waxed all heavy and said to himself yt he was the
most vnhappyest knight that lived when such a lady may receive blame for him
without any cause And also he leseth all Joy / for to leave ye country and the
sight of his lady where ever he gooth. So he complained and bewaylled himself
sorowfully / and when he had been a while in such pain and sorrow he refrayned
and enforced himself to be of good chere / and if he had sorrow Sydoyne had no
less / for she entered in to her garderobe and called Elyos with her and when
she saw no mo but they two and that they were alone than began her sorrow so
meruayllous great that it was pity to se.

How Sydoyne complained right pyteously the departing of her lover Ponthus.


A Said she Elyos my love he gooth his way ye fair / the good / ye flower of
knyghthode / and of curtesye / and the best on live / and the best instruct
and he that has best manner of demeanynge among all manner estates and all
manner men / and it is good reason / for he loves and dredeth god / and
worshyppeth the aeged and the wise people / and is honorable and humble both
to great and little / he is morrour of all largess / and of noblesse / what
his sweet heart is gentle and debonayr / what should my heart do after his
departing / but languysshe day and night never to have Joy nor rest / and I
wot well that his heart shall suffer no less. Than she fell in a swowne / and
Elyos took her in her arms and streyned her / and took rose water and
bespryncled her lady and comforted her ye fairest she might / but it auaylled
not she was so sorowefull. And after she said A Elyos my sweet love I may not
hyde my heart from you I love you and trust you so much. But sweet love this
sorrow comes to me when I think on the great untruth that has been
contryued against us in that that we never thought / for truer love was there
never. And after that I think on the langage that shall be said thereon / and
than after by me he leseth the country where he was so much byloued both of
little and of great / and all the harm that he has and shall have is and
shall be by me. And I am cause of all his myschyef. All these things puts
great sorrow to my heart / so she made great sorrow / and after she wyped her
eyes. And so ne after she went down in to her great chamber among her ladies
and gentylwomen / and made no femblau^t that she had any sorrow / for she was
right wise and well could she hyde herself. The ladies and gentylwomen wept
for pity and sorrow of Ponthus / and said that cursed be they that such false
tidings had contryued / but Sydoyne comforted them right swetely.

How Ponthus departed from the court of the king of Brytayne.


POnthus called a squire and the yomen of his chamber and commanded them to
trusse and put in a clothesakcke all thing that him neded and than he took his
leave of the court and of every man. So ne was there none but yt they ne wept
and cried and rent their here and made as great sorrow as they had seen al
their friends deed so much they loved him. So he departed from the court.
The barons and the knights and all that ever might lepe on horsbacke conuyed
him syghynge and weeping / and well they wend for to have witholde him with
fayrnesse saying unto him that the king was aeged and redooted / and that ye
ought not to set his heart of nothing that he said to him. But he would not
understand it and when they had conveyed him a two mile he abode and prayed
them to torn again. So he made them to torn again whyder they would or
not / at the leave taking there was weeping and waylynge enough saying. A
Brytayne so much thou ought well to weep when the gentle and the good
knight which had ye in peace and Joy / and kept the from harms / adversaries
and all enemies as the hen does her chekyns under her wings and he that
held all the Barons and ye people in good love. So they went by waylnge and
weeping and cursynge them that this false tails had ymagyned. And Ponthus rode
to saint Solo. And there he did ordeyne a ship. And on the morning he herd
mass and went to the sea. And herlaunt and his fellows wend for to have gone
with him all save ganelet / but he would not suffer them / and he said yt the
king had nourysshed them and yt he was of power to make them and do them good
and therefore he would that they should torn again unto him / with great pain
they might beparte from him so sorrowful they were. So they took their leave
weeping and when the ship was gone out of their sight than began their sorrow /
all save ganellet which made semblaunt to weep / but he had great Joy in
his heart And when Ponthus had lost the sight of Brytayne. Than fell the teres
from his eyes and said. Blessed be Brytayne and the fairest / the good / the
trewest ye lives / and the best / and all other ladies and gentylwomen for the
love of her / and all the knyghthode / for better nor sweter was there never.

How when Ponthus was arrived at the port of Hampton he found a wild bore
and cut him in the mids.


POnthus had his heart heavy and sorrowful for his lady which dwelled there /
and always he refrayned his sorrow the best that he might. So he arrived and
londed at Hampton / and came riding toward London. Then he met a greyhounde
in his way and a wild bore which greyhou^de followed and pynched the bore.
Tho Ponthous drew out his sword and smote the bore in two pieces. Harry the
kings sone of England that saw the stroke / was gretely ameruaylled / and
inquired him of whens he was / and Ponthus said unto him. Sir for as much as I
have herd great renown of the kings house of England and that he has two
sons which ben good knights I am come hither for to se the state and the
nobles of his house. Sir said Harry ye be welcome and I am one of the kings
sons / and pray you for too be with me. Sir in the name of god sith that it
pleases you. So they rode forth toward the court speaking of many thing /
when they arrived ye king was set at dinner. Harry commanded ye men should
deliver chamber and stable to his new knight / and it was done. The kings
sone entered in to the halle and his new knight with him / and salewed humbly
the king and ye queen. The king asked him how he had hunted / and he told
him / and than he asked him pryuely who is yt goodly knight / and he told him
how that he found him / and of the great stroke yt he had stryken the welde
bore. Much was Ponthus looked upon / for from every part men came for to se
him as it had been a miracle. Anon it was noysed in the court that there was
come the goodlyest knight of the world that the kings sone had brought. The
ladies beheld him and in especyall the kings daughters. Eeuerye of them said
that he is ye goodlyest knight that ever I saw. Ye say truth said another
if he be good yet is he more agreeable and pleasant / he was set at dinner with
the ladies. After mete the king went out of the hall and saw the bore which
was the grettest that he had seen of a great while / and was in two pieces. A
said harry to the king and to the queen / se what my new knight has done
with one stroke of his sword. Ponthus turned fro thens and was ashamed because
that men praised him for that stroke. The king asked him of whens he was / and
he said unto him that he was of the realm of france / and what is your name.
Sir said he men call me Surdyt dedroit voice So he asked him of the tidings
of france / and many other tidings / but the king found him so wisely
answering that he was all ameruayled. And than he went unto the queen and to
the lords and knights and said unto them that he had not of a great while
spoken with so wise nor with so gentylmanly a man as is that goodly knight in
talkyng And truly said the king mine heart says me yt he is gretter and more
noble than he makes himself So he dwelled there a long time and the more
that men saw him the more they loved and praised him.

How Ponthus put the stone before ye ladies at london at the request of sir
Harry his master.
Sir Johan the kings eldest sone had great sorrow for that he had not found
him before his brother Harry / of all manner of dysportes he could well entermete
him / as hawkynge and hunting / and he would never auaunt himself of nothing
yt he did / his manner and his behauynge pleased well every man / he loved well
holy church / and every day he would here mass and give his alms to ye
poor people / his byggest oath was in good faith it was thus or it is thus. On
an evening the earls sone of Gloucestre yt was a fair knight and a strong /
but he was somewhat proud / he cast ye stone with the kings sons and many
other / so he over cast sir Johan well a four fyngers / and auau^ted him
self yt he had cast before them all. So sir Harry bad Surdyt yt he should put
the stone / sir said Surdyt I can not / but sith yt it pleases you I shall do
as I can So he went to the stone and put it with the ferdeste A said sir Harry
by the faith yt ye owe to the woman of ye world that ye love best put it as
far as ye may when he herd that he was so coniured he bethought him of his
lady / and said sir ye have coniured me ^ore / for I owe to great faith to my
lady my mother A said Geneuer the kings eldest daughter. Surdyt. Surdyt / it
may not be that ye be now vnpurchaced and be so much and so goodly. Madame
quod he I am so simple and so boustous that none would list for to love me.
God wot well said Geneuer. And than she thought in her heart / ye would god he
loved me as much as I would love him. And than Surdit took the stone and put
it well a.vii. large fore before them all / and when ye king and the ladies saw
ye cast they meruaylled / ye earls so ne was abashed / and said I am overcome.
Than said sir Harry to Surdyt / why have ye so long tarried of this cast. A
sir said he had it not ben yt ye co^iured me so sore I would not have meddled me
/ for I have dyspleased him and me forthynketh for it was but for to obey your
pleasure / and ye wot well yt it sytteth not me to be in no man's
dyspleasau^ce. So his master apperceyued well his gentylnesse. Geneuer came to
her brother and said unto him. Fair brother come play you in my chamber and
bring your new knight with you. Fair sister I will well said he. So they
went to play and to dysporte them in her chamber / and then came wine and
spyces / and after they began to dance and to sing / but with great pain
they could make Surdyt for to dance / saying that he could not dance but when
he had a while daunced / he daunced best of all / and also with great pain
they might make him for to sing / and at the praynge of the kings daughter /
he sange a song the best of all / he made himself always uncunning of every
thing but at the last he did ever best. After that they had song the kings
sone and his sister began to sharp / and when they had harped a while they
prayed Surdyt for to harp / but with great pain they made hy^ for to harp At
the last he harped a new lay passing well. A said Geneuer Surdyt in good
faith I have great Joy that ye can that lay / for we have had great desire
for to know it / for it is the lay that the good knight Ponthus made for his
lady as it has been told us and we suppose well for whom he made it. Madame
said he I wot not who made it. So he was some what ashamed and changed
color when he thought on her he made it for* So he taught it to Geneuer and
to her sister which made it to be written. And so the two daughters came to the
king and to the queen and showed them. Truly said the king learn it fair
daughters I pray you for it is right good and the knight plays it well. Of
all dysportes and plays he could right well / and on a time Geneuer resonned
him and said. Surdyt se ye in this realm lady or gentylwoman where ye set your
heart and your pleasaunce tell it me / and in good faith I am she that with
good heart will help you in worship. Madame said he I thank you for always
have I need of your good ladyshyp and help / but as in that I love them all as
I ought to do good ladies. A Surdyt said she ben they all incomune / is there
none that has advantage one over another. Madame they ben all so good yt
there may no man to much preyse them nor love the^ in worship / and as for me
the love of a poor knight is but of little thing. A said she he is not poor
that has the beauty / the bounte / and the good condycyons and ye good
behauynge that ye have for in good faith I know none so fair nor so great a
lady in this country / that she ne ought to hold herself right well worshypped
for to be byloued of such a knight as I hope that ye be. Madame I am right fer
from such one as ye say / but it pleases you for to talk and dysporte you
with so poor a knight as I am. A said she ye believe me not / in good faith I
say but as I think / al way the knight took her talking in myrthe and in
bourde and gave her no manner of comfort / in so much that she aspyed that he
was not in will for to love the which dyspleased her much / for if she had
found in him any manner of comfort yt he would have loved she would have
dyscouered herself more largely and so apperceyued her well Surdyt / often
times many fair ladies and gentylwomen gave him many words of love and preue
lokes yt they would have loved him if he would have loved them but he made all
fair chere wtoute gyuynge any comfort of love / wherefore there were many
right sorrowful and in especyall the kings daughters / right wisely demeaned
him self Surdyt and pleased all. Many nyghtes he thought on his lady and made
lays of her the which fell all in complaining of sorrow and that he should
always serve her without chau^gynge and in these thoughts he took often times
great dyscomforte and sometime allegyaunce of his heavy thoughts. Tho it befell
yt there was rygour of war between the king of Irlonde and the king of
England. So there was trewes taken that was broken at Myghelmas and was
passed a three days. And ye king of Irlonde came with great arms. So the
tidings came to the court. And the king of England sent letters over all
and made his assemble and ordained his two sons for to goo. Surdyt asked his
master. Sir what title has the king your fader for to war. And Henry said
that his fader had good title taking it on his soul and on his peril Sir
said Surdit than shall I go with you for in no wrong title of war will I not
arm me for no thing for we owe better for to love ye souls than the bodies
that been mortelles which draw every day to their end and the soul may not
dye for she must have her reward of ye good deed and of the badde his master
herd him and praised him much in his heart / but well he thought that he had
good right.

How the Englysshemen and the Irysshe faught / and how Ponthus conquered and
took the king of Irlonde and how he made afterward the peace of him and of the
king of Irlande.


THe arms were assembled and went against the king of Irlonde yt kept the
field and had take a castle with a saute / wha^ he herd by his espyes that ye
kings two sons came to ye battle he went against them / for he was a good
knight and a manly. What should I say you the king of Irlonde had seven
bataylles and had many comyns / and our men had but four bataylles / of the
which the earl of hampton led the first and he was marchal of england. The
second led sir Henry. The third sir John^ the ky^ges two sons and in that
was most of barons. The fourth led ye king of cornewayle yt was a good
knight and neuewe to the king of England and he had with him the walshe
men. The king of Irlonde had most of his men on foot / but the English men
were most on horsbacke. At the assemblynge of the men of arms there was great
noise and great cry / and there were many knights overthrown that sith had
no power to rise / So the Earl had much to suff^e by three bataylles that were
against him. And when Surdyt that was in the second battle saw their
fellowship withdraw he said to his master. Sir it is time to depart for your
men lose ground / ye say well said sir Harry. Than they let run and smote
in to the battle and bette down knights and horses in their coming / and
than they drew their bright swerdes of stele and began the battle fyers and
cruel. So they drove abacke the Irysshemen with that the other battle came
to them where as the king was and the best knights / and there was great
noise and sown of trompettes and tabours and tarried but a while yt all the
bataylles assembled together. There were many fair Ioustes but it were to long
to tell. Surdyt yt had grere will for to do deeds of arms / beat down many
with a tronchon of a spear. And than he set his hand to his sword and began
for to smite on the right side and on the left side that he made before hy^ a
great way / he made himself be to byknowen of the^ that never erst had seen
him and he did such meruaylles of arms that there were many that left the
battle for to behold him. Than said the king if he live long he shall make
us to lose the field. So ye king smote him a trauers that he reuersed him /
and yet he fe^ not though he was nyghe overthrown / and when he was dressed
again he preysed himself little in his heart but if he be avenged / for he
knew well that it was the king of Irlonde for he had seen him do many great
deeds yt day / so he saw him rychely armed and arrayed with peerles and
precious stones Then Surdyt auaunced him and smote him so great a stroke upon
the helm that he astonyed him / and lay over the sadyll bow / but he would
not smite hy^ again for ferde of sleynge. And he said in his heart that if god
would he should not slay so good a knight. Than he took him by both sholders
and drew him to him and led him forth as the wulfe does his pray The
Irysshemen wend well for to have rescowed hy^ but he smote so great strokes
about him that none durst come nyghe him put smiting as the brachet abayeth
the wild bore. And so he bare him out of the battle / and set him in good
keeping and made him for to fyau^ce prison / when ye Irysshemen saw their
king was taken each of them lost hardynes / and began to fle to the wodes
and to the mountains there were many taken and slain and overthrown in the
chase. At the night every man drew to his bane^ and his standarde / they
lodged them in the feldes in the sign of vyctory. Sir Harry had great Joy
that his knight had taken the king of Irlonde. Every man spoke of the
knyghthode of Surdyt all men said that he had all overcome and was cause of
the vyctorye upon the morrow after they went before the castle yt the king of
Irlonde had gotten and it was yelden again and other towns and castelles. And
when winter came on every man came home in to his own country. Great was the
Joy of the tydy^ges that came to the kings house ye Surdyt had dyscomfyted ye
Irysshemen and had take the king of Irlonde in mids of all his men. So
there was great preyse of his knyghthode At his coming home the king and the
queen went against him and said welcome be ye / the best knight on live and
flower of all knyghthode. Surdyt was asshamed of the worship that they made hy^
and said to the king and to the queen that they shamed him / and if he had
wist he would not have come thither of all that year / for it behooves you not
to do me such worship / for I have not deserved it / and me seems yt ye
bourde with me. A said ye king right dear friend in good faith we wend we
had done well / but sith that it dyspleaseth you we shall do so no more.
And thus the king exscused him. Men asked the king what he would do with the
king of Irlonde. And he answerrd as Surdyt would for he would neither put him
in ward nor in prison but as Surdyt commanded. And he answered again as the
king were pleased so should be done. And if it pleases the king that he
might be at his first coming out of prison and be brought in to the hall and
men do him worship it were well done. The king said that this counsel was
good and true and so was it done.

How the king of Irlonde by the counseyll of Ponthus dyned in the hall with
the king of England.
Sir Henry brought hy^ in to the hall. The king of Irlonde was a right goodly
knight / and of the age of.xxx. year / and he was right rychely arrayed as in
purple / mantell furred with fables. Eeuery man beheld him. The king of
England and the queen made him great chere for the worship of Surdyt and was
set between the ky^ges daughters at mete. The king of Irlonde was right sad
and made simple chere. Surdyt came before him and said unto hy^. Sir be of good
chere / for ye have good prison for to be set between two so fair ladies.
Truly said ye king as long as god gives me so good prison I ought not to be
dysmayed. After mete tho Surdyt began for to bourde with the kings youngest
daughter and said. Madame how like ye the king of Irlonde / and if I thought
he might please you I would touch of marriage between you and him all though
it sytteth me not to do it for poor men are seldom herd among great lords.
A Surdyt quod she fair sweet sir are ye bethought thereon. Ye madame if I
thought that it were to your good pleasure. God wot said she he should please
me well if it pleased my lord my fader and my brethren / if so be that I might
not have another that is neither king nor duke / but he is ye best knight of
ye world. Madame it is hard to know ye best for there be many good / so he
thought well that she said it for him / and so did she / so he would not
supporte her and fell in to other matters. After that they went to play and
sport them in the gardynes / some at the chesse / and some at the tables /
and at other dysportes And at after souper they song and daunced. And on the
morrow after the king held his great counsayll and there was the king of
scotts that had wedded his sister. And the king had wedded ye kings sister
of scotts. And there was the king of cornewayle and the princes and ye barons
for to wete what should be done with the king of Irlonde. So it was spoken of
in diverse manners that long were to tell. So at the last the king asked
Surdyt and said. Surdyt say ye your auyse for it is reason your will be
herd / for by you we have him in subgeccyon. Feign he would have exscused him
and said. Sith it pleases you that I shall say forgive it me if I speak
rudely as a man simple and of little conning / but it seems me that the war
that is between you is only but self will fulness of hertes of great lords /
and it is not after the holy law nor the commandment of god / for he says
love thy neighbor as thy self. And also when god was borne the angel came
to the shepeherdes and anou^ced them the birth of god / and than went again
up in to the sky saying. Gloria in excelsis deo et in terra pax hominibus
bone voluntatis. That is for to say / yt glory be to god ye fader and peace to
men of good will / and also when god came in to any place he said to his
apostelles / peace be among you / and therefore if god have given you great
realms and lordshyppes / it is not that the rich should war upon the poor
for the poor people of the country ben dystroyed and exyled / and ye ought for
to keep them and nourysshe them in peace. So I shall tell you how that I think
that good peace should be among you / and that ye give him your youngest
daughter with the debate that is between you / and what it pleases you over.
All men said that blessed be he that so has thought and said for it is a
right true counseyll / so this counseyll was holden Than said the king of
Scotts fair dear friend sith that from you is come so good a counseyll and so
pleasant to every man as we may see / perform ye this deed and go speak with
the king your prisoner / and bring us word what his will is / for we charge
you of all this matter. Surdyt said that he should go with good will sith that
it pleases them. So he went and spoke with the king of Irlonde / and told
him that god loves them yt loves peace to their neighbors / and how yt many
men were lost by their hye courage and their couetyse. And than he asked him if
it might be that he would have the kings youngest daughter / and that his
raunsom and the debate between them were forgyuen. A said ye king if ye might
bring it about I were most beholden to you next god of all the world / and
will ye that it be so said Surdyt if I may bring it about / ye said the
king with all mine heart there is nothing I desire so much. So Surdyt
departed and came to the counseyll where as they abode ye answer. And they
asked him how he had done / and he said that ye king of Irlonde thanked them
much / and that this matter pleased him with all his heart. And how he had
great desire for to have her with the accord between them. And the king of
England made ye archebysshop of cantorbery for to handfest them / and a
month after they were wedded and there was a great feast / for the king of
Irlonde came with an hundred knights in a suit And he gave unto Surdyt four
stedes / and six coursers and ten thousand besau^tes of gold / with great
foyson of clothes of of gold / of purple / and of sylke / and good furs of
veer and of sables / he was much beholden unto the king of Irlonde for the
great gifts yt he gave him. And when the king had wedded her he led her
home in to his own realm where as she was right well beloved and worsshypped.

How Corboran the third sone of the Sowdan arrived in England and how Ponthus
occysed him.


IT befell in the.vii. year yt there came tidings in to the court yt the
soudans sone which was named Corboran had robbed and pylled many Yles and
realms / and had done much harm to the christian people and had may countres
trybutary to him / so he londed in England as his two brethren did / one in
Galyce / another in little Brytayne. So he was sore dred / for he came well with
a.ix.C. ships what great what small. And when he was londed he defied the
king of England. And badde that he should avoid the realm or else to
forsake his faith and yield him trybute. All the country was aferde for the
great nombre that he had of men The king took his counseyll and sent for his
people Then he sent for his brother of Scotlonde / and his sone in law of
Irlonde / and for his neuewe of Corn wayle / and also for the Earl of wayles /
and for all the lords of England. And when they were all assembled together
there was a great armee. The king sent forth his two sons and ye Surdyt well
a four mile from the host of the sarasynes for to ordeyne their bataylles
whereof the king of Scotts was the chyfe ledder of all the host. The first
battle led ye king of Irlonde. And the king of Cornewayle led ye second
battle. The earl of wales led ye third Sir Johan the kings eldest sone
led the fourth. Sir Harry led the fyfth battle. And the Surdyt led the
syxte battle. So there were syxte great bataylles And they were nombred moo
than thyrty thousand men / besides all the footmen / as arbalastres and
archers. When that the king Corboran herd tell of their coming he made mo
than.xii. bataylles yt were nombred moo than.xl. thousonde without footmen /
So they were right fyers and proud as they that had never ben dyscomfyted in
the space of.xii. year yt they departed from the Sowdan of babyloyne. So our
men rode to them ward in good ordinance / and wha^ they saw the host of the
turks and sarazyns ye held so great a country they were gretely ameruaylled
but they held themself well assured for they were clean shryuen and houseled.
Surdyt came before the batayles and comforted them and said fair lords /
dysmay you not for the great nombre that they be / for our quarrel is the
quarrel of Ihesu christ that fed five thousand men with five barley loves and
two fysshes. Also he may give us vyctorye one against an hundred so be every man
of good heart and smite surely upon them for he that well assaylleth or
defends upon them yt have no faith god helps him / and go we hardely with
out any fere. And ye shall se them anon dyscomfyted The every man took good
heart for the words of surdyt. And they answered. Sith that it pleases to god
that Surdyt was there they were not aferde for to be dyscomfyted. Than they
smote the horses with the sporres and ran one against another. And there was a
great sown of trompettes and tabours / that a man should not have herd the
thondrynge There was many overthrown that sith had no power for to rise / and
the battle lasted till that all ye bataylles were assembled on both parties
so that there was great noise of speres and of swerdes. Surdyt made himself
away whersoeuer he went and whom that he stroke he was deed either maimed.
Feragyne one of the sarazyns had slain sir Johan ye ky^ges eldest sone of
England and that was great harm. The bataylles were right cruel. And
Corboran the hethen king did great deeds of arms and saw sir Henry Surdytes
master was rychely armed and did many great deeds with his hands / he took a
spear great and sparte / and came upon a morell stead / and smote sir Henry in
ye side that he perced his harnays that it entered half a foot in to the body /
and that was great damage for he was a good knight and a manly. Surdyt serched
the prees and made all to flee before him with great strokes that he deled and
as he passed he saw his master fall to the ground with a spear in his side. It
is not for to ask if he was right sorry. And he began for to smite on the right
side and on the left and made himself a great way with the help of the king
of Irlonde that always abode by him. And than he alyghted of his horse lyfted up
his master and asked him how he fared. And he said well so yt he were avenged
on him yt so hurt him. What is he said Surdyt. It is Corboran the king of
this host / ne doubt you not said Surdyt for I shall avenge you or else dye.
So he dressed him up and lepte on horsbacke and bare him out of the prees.
And than Surdyt gadered to him an hundred good speres or more / and saw the
guffanon of king Corboran. And stroke to that part and brake the prees so
much that he saw where that Corboran did meruayllous deeds with his hands
and he was rychely armed / and had a crown of gold upon his basynet. Surdyt
said unto him. Ha falls cowarde that have slain my master you shall go no
ferder. So he smote him so great a stroke that he was all astonyed / and lay
upon his sadell bow And Surdyt smote again and smote the heed from the body /
and bare ye heed out of the battle unto his master. And when sir Henry saw
the heed he said blessed be god I shall now dye the more meryly. And gramercy
said he to Surdyt. Sir said he thy^ke not to dye for ye shall se the sarasynes
anon dyscomfyted sith that they know the death of their king. And he said
sothe for as soon as they wist it they put no more defense in them and were all
abashed and sorowed sore for to se themself without an heed. And Surdyt
entered in to the great prees and began to do great deeds of arms for to give
boldenes to all his felawshyp. And he beat down sarasynes and did such deeds
of arms that every man knew him by the great strokes that he gave. So thry
fled before him as sheep before the wolf. So they began to dysseuer and
fled by the country as wild bestes. And the English men and Irysshe men
and the scotts began the slaughter upon them on every side / there were slain
so many that ye feldes lay all strawed of deed men / the archers and the footmen when they saw any overthrown they all to hewed them. The sarasynes wyste
never where to hyde them nor to save themself / many of them fled toward
the ships / but Surdyt and the English men held them so short that they
might not escape but put them in to the sea that they drowned them self.
Great was the mortalyte upon them / and they called upon mahowne / but he never
did help them till all were slain and drowned.

How Ponthus pylled the ships of the sowdan.


ANd Surdyt came to a boat and endtred in and could speak well latin and asked
where was kings ship with all his tresoure / so one of the sarasynes told
him. Come forth said Surdyt in to this bote and bring me thither or thou shalt
dye / the other said that he should bring him well. So he took ores and three
sarasynes and rowed to the great ship and went in / ye ship was passing
great and well poynted. So there were some within that wend to have defended
them / but Surdyt laid haude on his sword and slew and drowned all that were
therein. So there abode no more therein but himself and the three sarasynes that
had brought him thither. So they said that they would be crystened sith that
mahowne had let their lord to be slain and all their felawes. And after
that they were crystened / and Surdyt gave them much good. Than said one of
ye sarasynes se these great hutches and these great cofers they ben full of
gold and silver that our master had robbed and spoiled upon christian lands
that were nyghe the sea. So no man might think the great riches that was
within. Eueryche other lords took of the ships for there were well nine
hundred / and the flode failed them There was so great wy^nynge that every man
was rich by that Journey / Surdyt called of his men such / as he trusted and
betoke them ye ship to keep and commanded them that it should be brought
to London to one of his lodgings that lay upon the water for he thought to
wage men of arms for to go in to his realm that the sarasynes kept in
seruage. And nevertheless he gave many great gifts that every man praised him
of his largess. That night passed and was upon a tuesdaye / the wednesdaye
they serched ye field for to wete who was deed of the christian people. So they
found the kings two sons of England and the earl of wales the baron of
staunforde / the earl of Gloucestre / three other barons / and.xii. knights /
and well a two.M. of christian people. So some were borne in to their countrees
and the remenau^t buried at an abbay. The king and the queen had great Joy of
the vyctorye / and all they said with one voice that the good knight Surdyt had
dyscomfyted the field / and if he had not ben they had lost the field / but
his great knyghthode saved them and dyscomfyted the field and their enemies. So
he had all the price / but he was right sorrowful of the death of the kings two
sons. The kings and ye queen made great Joy to Surdyt / and so did all the
ladies / and they said upon him that by him they were quyte of their enemies.
Surdyt wept when he saw the king for pity of his master and the king
comforted him and said that in more noble service might they not dye than in
the service of god for to keep ye country and our holy law against the
mysbyleuers.

How the king of England and the king of scotts made a parlyament and would
have given unto Ponthus to his eldest daughter.


THe king behaved hy^ right fair all though he were sorrowful in his heart.
Than ye king held his great counseyll. And there was his brother of scotlonde
/ and his neuewe of cornewayle and all the lords. And the king said unto
them / fair lords ye se ye great meruayles that have fallen in this realm
and how I have lost my two sons / and how I am aged and the queen is not
young. So we must be aduysed who shall hold the realm after me / and who
shall govern it in mine age. The king of scotts stood up and said I have
your sister to my wife. And I gave my sister to your wife and so I hold me for
your brother And therefore my counseyll is thus. Give your daughter unto Surdyt.
And ye shall be dredde and doubted and your realm well governed. And all
answered with one voice he has well said / and the king of England accorded
thereto with all his heart. And the king of scotts was charged to speak unto
Surdyt. So he went and said unto him. Surdyt ye ought well to thank god of
the virtues that he has given you / for every man loves you. The king and
all his counsel have chosen you to have his eldest daughter and to be king
after him / and in his life to govern his realm Sir said Surdyt I thank the
king and all his lords of the great worship that they profre me / but they
ben symply aduysed as me seems / for it is not sitting that so great a
kings daughter and heir should take so poor a man as I am / and of so low a
kynred. And if god will the noble blood of England shall not be abessed by me.
What is that ye say quod the king we be all one fader and of one mother. And
more over there is so much worship and worthynes in you that ye be worthy to
have a better. They spoke much of this matter / but they could find no way
that he would consent / so fair he found Surdytes excusacyons that it was
meruayll to here. And when he saw that it should not be he went again to ye
king and his counseyll / and told him what he had found and how that Surdyt
thanked ye king / and how that he exscused him. Truly said the king he is
married or ensured / or else he loves such one as he will not be untrue to.
Truly said all the lords we wene yt it so be. Who so ever was glad or sorry
the ky^ges daughter was right sorry what semblau^t yt ever she made / and said
to herself. Alas what eyleth me yt god has not given me ye grace that I might
not have hy^. Truly I se well that he has set his heart in some other place
where as he will keep keep his troth / or perauenture he is married / sore she
co^playned in her heart and sorowed for over al men of ye world she loved him
best.

Now here I leave of Surdyt and of the kings house of England and turn again
to Sydoyne to the king of Brytayne.
THe term dureth yet that Ponthus set to Sydoyne / but Sydoyne has many a
straight thought and heaviness both day and night / and wisely she demeaned
herself that no man should aspye her heaviness save Elyos the which knew all
her counseyll and said unto her. Alas by me is gone out of this realm the best
and the goodlyest knight of all the world / and often times she sorowed and
wysshed for him / but Elyos comforted her in the best wise that she might. Now
it befell that Guenellet had all his desire for he was master of all the ky^ges
house of Brytayne by his great wyles and subtle speech. So he put out Harlant
the senesshall out of his office and made ye king his heavy lord and had all
the rule in his hands. Sydoyne was desired of kings and of dukes / but she
would here speak of no marriage. So among all other the king of Bourgoyne
herd speak of her of the earl of mou^tbelyart his cosyn that Sydoyne was the
fairest and the connyngest that was in any country. So the king was of her so
amerous that he might have no rest / so he inquired by whom the king was
ruled and governed. And they told him by a knight that hight Guenelet. So he
sent him many presents and great gifts / and made him large promys so that
he would labor that he might have Sydoyne. And so for couetyse Guenelet
let not but labored ye king and said unto him. Sir mary your daughter
while ye be in good health / and allye you with some good king and that shall
be wisely done. Here is the king of bourgoynge that desires her and he is
right noble and a rich king / and it were great folly to refuse him. And the
king sent unto Sydoyne and himself said unto her fair daughter I am old
and aged and I have no child but you / and ye be desired of many ky^ges and
great lords / and I have herd say he that refuses reason reason will refuse
him / and so it befalls often whereof god give grace it do not so by you.
Fair daughter ye king of Bourgoyne desires you / and he is neuewe to the
king of France / and he is right mighty and a rich king. So me seems he
ought not to be refused / and as for me if it like you I am accorded thereto Sir
said Sydoyne it is no need yet to be wedded. Truly said the king ye have so
long forborne and I know no cause why / but I shall never love you but if ye
accord you to this. She was sore abashed and heavy that her fader held her
so short she said unto him. Sir ye wot well there is no thing ye will
command me to do but I will do it with a good will. My right dredefull lord
I tell you in counseyll that there is a sykenes in me I dare not tell it / but
with ye grace of god I shall be hole of it / but it will be first somer or
about Pentecost / and at that time I shall fulfill your will. Truly said the
king it suffyseth me / and I forgive you till ye term / and that was the
seventh year that Ponthus set term that he departed from Sydoyne. The king
was well pleased with his daughter and told unto Guenelet of ye term that she
had set him. Guenelet said that it was well done / and he sent unto the king
of Bourgoyne that the marriage was granted to be on tuesdaye in Pentecoste.
Sydoyne was in great disease / and sent diverse times to wete if she might have
any tydy^ges of Ponthus and she could none here because he had changed his
name / and so was she in great sorrow both day and night / when he time drew
nyghe she was sore dysmayed / and sent after Harlant and said unto him. A
Harlant my dear friend I have great sorrow that my lord is so affonned on
Guenelet which makes him for to do many strange things / one is to put you
out of your office and also by his false wyles he will put away the best
knight that at this day bears arms as men say yt was Ponthus that ye taught
and nourysshed three year the which loved you so well / and he makes my lord
to do many shameful things by his false flaterynge / and in like wise he
makes me to be given to the king of Bourgoyne against my will / for men say
yt he has many evil condycyons / and also he is aged and corsyous and lame
and dronklew / but I may not do against my lords commandment / so the term
draws nygh of Pentecost. And I wot well if Ponthus wyfte it he would set
remedy thereto / so I pray you that by your counseyll remedy may be had / for
there is no man in the world that I would discover me to save only unto you.

How Sydoyne sent Olyuer sone to Harlant in to England for to find Ponthus.


MAdame said Harlant / never god will that ye shall have an housbonde of such
condycyons. But I shall tell you what we shall do. Olyuer my sone is one of the
knights as far forth as I know yt Ponthus loves best / he shall go in to
England and enquere of him / and in to scotlonde and Irlonde whyther he be a
live or deed / so he shall know the troth. A said she in good faith ye say
well. So Harlant spoke unto his sone which went with good will and charged him
of all ye matter between Ponthus and Sydoyne and took him money enough for his
exspences. So Olyuer passed the sea and londed at hampton where he required of
Ponthus. And he found well that seven year before there was passed in to the
court ye goodlyest knight and the best that ever men might se / but he named
him self Surdyt de driot voice. Olyuer supposed yt it was he and that he had
changed his name for certain causes / so he rode forth he and his man / and
came thrughe the forest where he found thieves / and because he could not well
speak the langage of the country / and because they saw him well arrayed and
rychely / they ran upon hy^ and took him and dyspoyled him / and took from
him all that ever he had / and hurt him foul / but he escaped from them in
the forest and saved himself / so he had great honger and thirst and great
cold. So he sorowed sore / for he might find no comfort of his disease / and
the lettynge of his enquest grieved him wors than all his loss. He passed the
forest and went beggynge his mete fro door to door till he came to the kings
house and it was the same day that the king of scotlonde had spoken unto
Ponthus of the marriage of his nece Genneuer.

How Olyuer found Ponthus in the court of ye king of England.
POnthus was in the court where as he beheld Iustes and dysportes of young
knights and diverse manners. Olyuer was all naked and dyspoyled and looked about
him and saw Ponthus and knew him well. So he came and kneled down before him
and said to him My lord Ponthus god give you good life and increase you in the
worship that ye be in. Ponthus was all abashed and said unto him. Friend to
whom speak ye Sir I speak to you that I know well / for ye be ponthus the
kings sone of Galyce / ye have forgoten the country of Brytayne and though I
be poor and naked it is befall me in seeking of you. And ye ought to know me
for I am Olyuer the sone of Harlant. And when Ponthus herd him he looked upon
him and knew hy^ well. And than he took of his mantell and cast it about sir
Olyuer / and took him by the hand and kyssed him weeping and might no word
say unto him. Tha^ he took him by the hand and led him in to his chamber /
and it was a great while or he might speak. And when that he might speak he
said unto him. A dear brother and friend how do they in your country / and how
be ye thus arrayed / and told him all the matter from the beginning to the
end. Ponthus cladde him with the best clothes that he had / and when he was
arrayed he a right goodly knight. Than he told unto Ponthus how he was robbed
and in point to be deed / and how yt he came beggy^ge his bread fro door to
door / and after he told him how Guenelet had all the rule of Brytayne and how
the king byleued in no man but in him / and how that he had put out his fader
of his office of the seneshall ship of brytayne. And after he told him of
Sydoyne how that she should never consent to no maryagesyth that he departed /
and of the great disease that she has suffered / and how that she may no longer
abide than tuesdaye in Pentecost that than she shall be married unto the king
of Bourgoyne ye which is full of evil tatches / but Guenelet made the marriage
that had great gifts of ye said king. So Sydoyne sends you word by me that
ye will set remedy in this matter upon all the loves yt is between you and
her. And when he herd of the great troth of his lady the teres fell from his
eyes / and he said if god will he should set remedy / so they spoke of diverse
things.

How the king of England knew Ponthus and of what lygnage he was and
exscused him that he had not more honored and worshypped him.
THe tidings went in to the court that there was come a man of little
Brytayne yt knew well Ponthus the which named himself Surdyte when the king
and all his household wyste of it they were sore ameruaylled. And the king and
the queen said to the king of scotts / it was never but that my heart said
and thought that he should be of greteter birth than he made himself by the
noble deeds of him. A said ye queen I meruayll me no more though he will not
have our daughter / for I have herd say that he loves our cosyn Sydoyne of
Brytayne without any shame. Truly said the king it may well be wha^ he will
not be married in this country. So at souper time Ponthus came in to the hall
and his knight with him the which was rychely arrayed as in clothes of sylke
furred with sables / so he was a right goodly knight to se. The king of
England and the king of scotts came against Ponthus and said unto him. A
Ponthus why have ye made us to do ourselfe such dysworshyp as ye have done /
for ye said that ye were but a poor knights sone / so thereby they were
disceyued / and we have gretely offended for because we have not done you
worship as we ought for to have done / but all the blame is in you / for in
good faith we did but as we knew when Ponthus saw the great courtesye of ye
king and how he dysblamed him self he said unto him. All though I be a
kings sone it is but a little thing for a man dysheryted is but little
praised / so it is a little thing of poor noble his deeds ben right simple
and therefore men ought to set little by him. A said the king save your grace
/ he that has the noblesse / the bounte with the good condycyons and worthynes
that is in you / it is worth a kings raunsom / for ye be lykly to conquer
your own and diverse other. Ponthus was asshamed of the great prees and
changed his words in to other matters. The king made him to sit at souper
between the queen and his daughter whyther he would or not but it was with
great pain After souper they went to dysporte them in the gardyn at diverse
dysportes. Ponthus came to the king of Scotts / and the king of Irlonde /
and the king of cornewayle / and some of the great lords and they set them
down in an erber / and than he said to the king. Right high and mighty
prince and to you al my lords and friends I would made a request unto you all
my lords and friends. I would make a request unto you of a needful matter of
mine. Than he told them how ye sowdan had sent his three youngest sons for to
conquer upon christian realms / and how he delivered them great army / and navy
and tresoure and how that he said unto them / he that shall most conquer and
be most worthy of knyghthode / he should be best welcome to him. And how one
of them londed in Galyce / and by wyle and treason they gate the town of
Columpne in Galyce / and of the great sorrow and myschefe that he did / and
how they slew the king his fader. And than he told them how that an old
priest hid them two days and two nyghtes in an old cave in a roche / and of
ye great fere that they had and as the wolf gooth out of the wode for honger
right so I and my thyrtene fellows of great lords sons went out of the cave
and how they were taken / and also how the knight saved them / and how they
landed in little Brytayne / and how their ship brake upon a roche / and how
they were saved. And as he told his tale many of the lords the teres fell
from their eyes for to here the peril and the shrowe that he escaped from.

How Ponthus departed out of England with a great company of people.


ANd after wha^ he had all told his tale he said unto them that he would goo
for to conquer the myssebyleuers that held his land that was his faders /
for I thank god said he I have been in the felawshyp of them where as the pride
of two of them has been dystroyed / so is there no more on live but the
third that holds the realm yt was my faders and that I ought for to have /
and I understand yt the country is well governed and wisely / and few people
of the country slain / for they live in seruage and pay trybute every piece a
besaunte of gold / and for the great tresoure that the king reyseth he
suffers every man to live in what believe that ever he will. Sir said the king
of England I offer you my body with good heart all though I be old and aged
/ and after my men and my tresoure. Sir said Ponthus I thank you hyghly. The
king of scotts and the king of Irlonde and the other kings and the lords
all they offered him body men and goods / so there was none but yt they offered
themself to him. Ponthus thanked the king and all the lords right humbly and
wisely / and said unto the king and to the other kings and lords y^ that god
of his grace yield them the worship that they offered him. My lords said he
to the kings I shall neither led kings nor other great lords / but men of
arms sowdours a twelve thousand the which that I will wage / and I thank
god I have enough whereof / and he said troth / for at the last battle he
found enough in king Corborans ship right great tresoure so much that it
was meruayll to here and with great pain it might be nombred. They offered him
enough of gold and haueour / but he would none take of them / but took of
every king of the best men that they had so many that he had well a twelve
thousand men well arrayed in good ships. So he waged them at their own
will / and they had great Joy for to go with him / he led with him ye earl
of Gloucestre / the earl of Rychemonde / and the earl of Derby chyeftaynes and
captains of the english men. Of scotts the Earl of Douglas / and of every
country a lord to govern the men of their country when they were in the
ships well arrayed and garnysshed of al thing that them neded / and had taken
their leave of the lords and of their friends / they drew up sails and had
wind at will and departed with great Joy out of the haven of hampton. And
Ponthus took his leave of the kenge and the queen and of Genneuer her daughter
So there was enough of sorrow and weeping / and they made Ponthus to promys
them to come again and se them as soon as he might come unto an end of his
war. And he thanked them hyghly of the great honor that they had made him.
The king of scotts and the king of Irlonde / and the king of cornewayle
they conveyed Ponthus whyther he would or not to ye ships / and there he took
his leave of them with great heaviness / and the king of Irlonde said unto him
Now I se well that ye love me not ye that have done so much for me that
neytheyr I nor my realm may never deserve it to you / and ye will not suffer
me to go with you to bear you felawshyp. Sir said Ponthus I thank you I refuse
not your good help after that I find in my country if need be / but I shall
neither led you nor none of mine lords till that I know more how that the
country stands for certain causes So they took their leave that one of that
other / and thus departed Ponthus from the realm of england with his army.
And his going was sore complained of the men of the land. So he sailed day
and night that he londed by Uennes / he ordained his navy to abide in the high
see / and said that he would not that they should come to land nor show past
a forty ships / and that they should make them merchants to come for salt
to ye bay. So he ordained well his navy and all his need / and took with him
certain vessel where as he would land and well a three hundred fighting men
/ and londed by night between Auroy* and vennes / and there he ordained that
they should not goo thens till they herd tidings of him / and that they
should come to him like as he should send them word / and this was on the
mondaye of Pentecost / and the wedding should be on the tuesdaye of ye king
of bourgoyne and Sydoyne. Than he lepte on horsbacke he and a man with him on
the tuesdaye in the morning betymes. And as he rode he met with a poor palmer
beggynge his bread the which had his gown all to clouted / and an old pylled
hatte / so he alyght and said to the palmer / friend we shall make a change of
all our garments / for ye shall have my gown and I shall have yours and your
hatte. A sir said the palmer ye bourde you with me. In good faith said Ponthus
I do not / so he dyspoyled him and cladde him with all his raiment / and he put
upon hy^ ye poor man's gown / his gyrdell / his hosyn / his shone / his
hatte / and his bourden. And than his man said unto him / sir what do ye be ye
out of your wit that have given your clothes for such an habyte. Hold thy
peace said ponthus thou wotest not why that I do it / keep the pryuely and thy
two horses here at ye towns end and go not away till that I come again to
the.

How Ponthus departed from his dwarf and went to Uennes like a pilgrim and
how he found Guenelet and the king of Bourgoyne.
SO he went forth with his bourden and came in to the way where as the king
of bourgoyne should pass. And anon after he saw coming his summers and his
officers / and than after he saw the king come riding on a palfray coming
together he and Guenelet the traitor / and the king held his hand on
Guenelettes sholdre / as they passed Ponthus said Se here two well nourysshed
felawes for both they have great belyes. A saint Mary said he to Guenelet your
belly has received many a fat morsel of the court / ye are full well
shapen for to be a very great flaterer of the court. Guenelet wexed reed and
was an angered and turned his horse and said unto him what falls trewande must
thou myssay me / so he would have stryken him with his warderer and Ponthus
lift up his bourden and came to hymwarde and said that he would make his berde
if he touched him / and the king said to Guenelet / let the trewande go / for
men should have no worship for to touch him. So they went forth. And Ponthus
that loved them not made as he had been a fool and mocked them and followed
after and came to ye court / and as he saw yt men went in he threste in
among the prees / and the porters wend for to have put him out and took him
by both sholders for to have put him abacke but Ponthus threw him underfoot
and passed forth and said that he was one of the poor men that should ete
before the bryde in ye worship of god and of his apostles.

How Sydoyne knew the pilgrim Ponthus by a ring that she had given him or he
went for to dwell in England.
AT the solemn feast of this marriage of the king of bourgoyne and of Sydoyne
at after mete the bryde should give them dry^ke her own hands such was the
custom there. So Ponthus went and set him down as for one of ye poor men /
great was the wedding and great was the feast. Ponthus ete but little but
looked upon his lady the which was right simple and all for wept / for
Guenelet had affermed over all yt Ponthus was in Irlonde and she wend verily
that it had be so. After mete when the tables were take up they led the
bryde unto her chamber for to change her array / and her attire for to go unto
the scaffolde for to se the Iustes. And as they went to her chamber there was a
tresaunce where as the.xiii. poor men were. And there were two gentylwomen
that one had a great pot of silver full of wine / that other held a cup of
gold. Sydoyne took the cup and gave every man drink. And Ponthus was the
last and he took the cup and drank and let fall in the cup a ring of
gold with a dyamounde the which that she had given him as ye have herd
before / when he had dronken he said unto her pryuely. Madame drink the little
remenaunt for the love of Ponthus. And when she herd the name of Ponthus her
heart lepte in her breast and so she drank the remenau^t / and as she drank
she apperceyued and knew the ring so she was all entered in to Joy and wyste
never what to think. Than she called Elyos her gentylwoman and badde her in
counseyll that she should bring the much poor man in to her warderobe / and
the other poor people wend that she would have given him some thing or some
great gift for the love of god / for they knew her for a good woman and right
charytable. and when she was in her warderobe there was none but she Elyos and
the poor man. Than Sydoyne spoke first and said unto him. Sweet friend and
love who took you the ring that I found in the cup. I pray you tell me and
hyde it not from me. Wot ye not quod he to whom ye took it to / yes said she
is he deed or a live tell me. Truly said he he is on live. She Joined her
hands together and thanked god and said lord I thank the of thy grace. O
madame wend ye that he were deed / ye truly said she for Guenelet had so
affermed it over all. Madame said he if ye saw him what would ye say / what
should I say said she / never erst befell me so great Joy as I should have.
When he herd all this he fordyde no more his speech / and took a cloth and
rubbed his vysage / and anon she knew him. A said she ye be Ponthus the
thing in the world that I most love next god and my fader and ye be right
welcome. Than she had great Joy and halfed him. A madame said he I have great
Joy yt ye be so well and rychely married / and he said it for to assay her. A
my sweet love said she speak never thereof for I shall never have other than you
if it please you for to have me / for I swear to you both with mouth and with
heart / and so y^ latter deed stands for naught for the first oath must be
holden. A madame think never for to take a poor man beggynge his bread and to
leave a rich king and a mighty. I would never counsel you so for to acquyte
your troth. Right dear knight and love said she I shall never have other but
you / for I should be a thousand times more at hertes ease to suffer in your
felawshyp the pouerte and disease that ye suffer than all the richesse with ye
myghtyest king that is. And if ye have any pouerte or trybulacyon god has
sent you for to assaye you the which after will send you of richesse more
than ever ye had so that ye have good trust in him. When Ponthus herd of the
great truth of Sydoyne and stedfastnes of her / the teres fell from his eyes
and after smyled and said. Madame never truer nor better lady was there never
than ye be. I shall hyde no thing fro you wete it for troth that I have more
gold and silver and precious stones and Iewelles seven times than has my
lord your fader / and also I have.xii. thousand men of arms waged for half
a year to conquer the realm that was my faders / so dysmay you for no thing
/ but I shall tell you what ye shall do / make Polydes my cosyn germayne for
to lead you and that he keep him with you and all my fellows such as love me
and I shall come se you in such array. So he told her how he should be
arrayed and ordained and I may no longer abide with you. And took his leave and
fold her in his arms and halsed her / and yet durst not kiss nor desire for
to kiss her.

How Ponthus came to the Iustes and Iusted at adventure with the king of
Burgoyne and ouerthrewe him so that he dyed.


SO he went his way halting as he had been a lame beggar / and came to his
man that abode him and lepte upon horsbacke and came to the wode where as he
had left his felawshyp / and when they saw him in such plyght they knew him
not / and some there were that would have taken him for a spy / but he began
to laughe and said I am Ponthus quod he to them and than every man knew him /
so there was game enough. Sir said the earl of Gloucestre almoost we had do
you shame / how be ye thus dysguysed. Fair lords quod he I did it for a
cause I would not ben known. Than ordained he yt every man should arm them
for to come to ye Iustes / and that they should come by ^xx. by.xxx. to the
scaffolde and that none should Just but by his commandment / and he told
them of the marriage and of the great feast that was there. So Ponthus arrayed
him and forty knights all in a suit of the best and of the notablest of all
his felawshyp. And he told them all his matter that he had to do. So they
came to Just in the ranges / and the brytons and the bourgoygnyons were sore
ameruaylled what they were yt were so nobly arrayed / and that so well Iusted.
And Sydoyne was come before to the scaffoldes with ladies and gentylwomen / and
Polydes ladde her by the brydel and therefore was Guenelet right wroth that
Polydes had taken it from him / saying unto him that she had so commanded him.
And she had told him before that he should se Ponthus his cosyn germayne /
wherefore Polydes had so great Joy that no heart might think it / and than she
told it to all his fellows save only Guenelet / wherefore they were all as
Joyous as they might be / and it is not to for ask if Sydoyne had all worldly
Joy in her heart. So she saw Ponthus coming the which was more semelyer
than any other knight and more goodlyer / and he Iusted from rank to rank /
and bette down knights and horses and brake speres and did meruayles in
arms. Sydoyne bowed down to Polydes and told him. Se ye yonder knight armed
in purple and asure with a white lady that holds a lion enchayned / and over
the lion ben letters of gold that says. God help the forty felawes. And
they ben all in suit of him save only they have no letters of gold / truly
he with ye letters of gold is Ponthus your cosyn germayne and all the other
ben of his felawshyp. So Polydes held hy^ with Sydoyne like as she had
commanded him. The king of bourgoyne came in to the field upon a great Iennet
of spain / and he was rychely armed / and with him forty knights in a suit
and every man his spear in his hand / so they began to run and Just. And
when Ponthus saw them he dressed him toward them and began to overthrow
both horse and man / so that every man was abashed for to mete with him. The
king of Brytayne yt was on the scaffoldes with the ladies and the old
knights asked who was that goodly knight that had the lady in his shield and
holds a lion enchayned with letters of gold and has so many knights in a
suit / every body said that they wyste never / save that he hytteth none but
that he overthrows. So he overthrow and beteth down knights and horses /
and what deeds of arms that he does / he is a strong adversary* Truly the
lady of Dueyl which was right wise and a fair lady I saw never no knight
erst yt could so well ride an horse nor none yt resembled so much Ponthus / on
whose soul god have mercy. Than said the king to Sydoyne / fair daughter I
would not that he should mete with your husbonde / for I am aferde yt he should
hurt him / for his strokes ben over hard. My lord said she if he be wise he
shall keep him fro hy^ / for yonder knight is to hard. They had much talking
of Ponthus and of his knyghthode / but all they were in great thought for to
wete what he was. It tarried not long after yt Ponthus of adventure encountered
with the king of bourgoyne so he saw him right nobly and rychely arrayed and
armed and he thought well that it was the king or some great lord of
Bourgoyne / than he smote his horse with his spores and hytte him in the mids
of ye shield / and his spear was great and strong so he took him as he which
had enough of strength and hardynes / and in especyall to do deeds of arms
before his lady that of so long time he had not seen her / so the stroke was
so great that he bare the king over the croper of his horse / that he lost the
brydell of gold / and that other was young and strong and bare him backwarde
and fell in to a great pytte full of stones and Ponthus wend for to have lepte
over / but they fell all in so sore the king underneath all that he was deed
and his horse deed. The Bourgoynyons were all heavy and sorry for their lord /
and every man cried ye new wedded king is deed. Ponthus herd it yt which
recked but little of it and no more did Sydoyne Ponthus alyghted of his horse /
and all his fellows and went up unto the scaffoldes and did of his helm /
and anon every body knew him / he came to Sydoyne and took her by the hand
and said. Madame ye must be my prisoner / save ye shall have good prison. She
wexed reed and had great Joy in her heart an answered again if I owe to be
your prisoner I must needs suffer it. The king was gone down of the
scaffoldes / the which was right sorry for the death of the king of bourgoyne /
but when it was told hy^ that it was Ponthus that had done all the meruayles
and yt he had taken his daughter he was right Joyful and said ye god has
ordained yt he shall have her / and we may give her to no better knight / for
truly there is in him so much worthynes yt he is able to have ye ky^ges
daughter of france / but truly I wend he had be deed as men did me to
understand. Than he came against Ponthus / and Ponthus said yt good life give
him god as to his lord / there was great Joy between them. It is not to ask
if the lords and the ladies made him great Joy. And his cosyn germayne and
his felawes made him great Joy / save Guenelet which made Joy with mouth but
not with heart. The cite and all the people thanked hyghly god / and said that
god had vysyted them / for we shall now have a king which shall keep us from
all harms and dyseases. Great was the Joy of this adventure. Ponthus held
with him the earl of Gloucestre / and the earl of Wynchestre / and the earl of
Rychemou^de / and diverse other barons and knights of England / and all the
remenaunt he sent to the ships. The king made great Joy to these lords and
so did Sydoyne / and in especyall to the earl of Gloucestre the which was
right a good knight / and he asked him of the welfare of the king of England
which was his cosyn. The earl told him of the auentures that was befall to
the king and to the realm / and how by the worthynes of Ponthus they had the
over hand of the king of Irlonde / and how that he took him in the mids of
all his men and led him away whether he would or not / and all the manner /
and also how that he would not put him to no raunsom / but made a proeas
between both kings. And also the earl told him how the soudans sone londed
with great nombre of people / and how they were by Ponthus dyscomfyted and
slain / and how Ponthus wanne the great tresoures of the said hethen king
that be so great that it is meruayll for to here / for he had not cessed to
rob and pyll upon christian lands well the space of.xii. year. After he told
hy^ how yt he named himself Surdyt de driot voice / and made himself but a
poor knights sone. When the king herd that he had so named himself he
auysed him and said that he did it because that he had aledged matter against
him / and the name was by cause that he should have his daughter / and the
cause that he named hy^ de droit voice / because he would have foughten with
two or three / and many studied upon these names. After the earl told the king
how the king of England and all his counsel had offered Ponthus to have
Genneuer his eldest daughter / and to be king after ye decesse of her fader /
and in his life to be gouernoure of England / and how he exscused hy^ and
would not be it. And also he told hy^ yt by a naked knight he was known yt he
was the sone of Harlant / and how the king and all the lords held themself
asshamed for yt they had done him no more worship than they did because he was
a kings sone. The king of Brytayne had great Joy to here tell of the great
worship of Ponthus / and yet well more had Sydoyne / and the lords yt were
there / for it was right a noble and a good tale to here After yt the earl had
told his tale the lords of Brytayne called the king aside and said to hy^.
Sir what thing will ye do / do speak unto Ponthus in haast yt he take your
daughter / and than shall ye and all your realm be well kept / for we be in
doubt yt he will not take her because of ye kings daughter of England / for
yt is much better marriage than this / and also he has so great tresoures and
riches yt sets but little by any danger. Fair lords said the king I pray
you that ye will think thereon / for I desire it most of any thy^ke in the
world / for never erst befell us so good an adventure. Than went the lords
and comyned together and gave the voice to speak to the vycou^t of lion for to
speak to Ponthus. Sir they spoke to him right goodly how that he was first
saved in ye country of bryatayne and how that the king loved him / and how
that by envy and false lesynges the king and he were at debate / and how that
the king was aged / and how that he was to light of believe / and there is no
man without some tatche. And therefore ye king for the love that he has to you
and for the wealth and profit of the country / he offreth you his daughter and
to be king after him. And Ponthus yt desired none other thing answered. Than
he thanked the king hyghly and his lords / and that he was the first lord
that ever did him good or worship / and he woteth well he could never deserve
it unto him / and if he were of the vylue and worthynes to have the gretest
lady of the world / he would not take her to refuse the king and his daughter
his barons and the country of much he is behold to them yt he loves them
over all other. The barons had great Joy of the answer and they went and
told ye king to whom it pleased well.

How Ponthus was fyaunced unto the fair Sydoyne daughter of the king of
Brytayne.
THey sent for ye bishop for to fyau^ce them And on the mondaye seven night
after Pentecost was set ye day of marriage. Sydoyne had great Joy and Ponthus
also. It is not to ask if they had an.C. times greter Joy than they showed
Great was ye Joy in brytayne of the marriage both of rich and of poor.
Ponthus which was right wise and would have no maugre of no body / he came to
Guy of bourgoyne the kings brother / and to Aymberte de chaloys and to ye earl
of mountbelyart yt which were come with the king of bourgoyne / and excused hy^
to them / and said unto them yt he was right sorry of this adventure of ye ky^ges
death and that in good faith when he Iusted with hy^ he wyste not what he was And
they answered said yt they byleued hy^ well / for it was but adventure of arms
/ and therefore he ought not to be dismayed / for he might not do there to So
Ponthus offered them all manner of gentylnes / and on the morrow after he
ordained yt the service was done for the soul in the goodlyest wise / and
gave.iii. d. sterlenges to all them yt would ask it / so there was never seen
in the country before so great alms / for the which he had great price / and
the ky^ges friends could him great thank / and thanked hy^ much. The body of
the king was enbaumed and laid in a chair right well stuffed / and besene of
fair horses in to his country of Bourgoyne to be buried. And Ponthus made the
body to be conveyed with great torches well a.vi. mile and did it all the
worship that he could all though he were not sorry of his death. Than ye lords
of bourg^yne made him to turn again / and took their leave of him and they
gave praysynge to Ponthus saying there was no knight but he / of worthynes / of
largess / and of courtesye / for he loves god and holy church / and that he
has so well done his deuoyre yt they were all ameruaylled Ponthus came again
to vennes and went to Sydoyne and kyssed her / and they talked together of many
pleasant things / and he bourded with her and said unto her / if that she
could any maugree to his spear that had delivered her of her husband / and she
wexed reed and said unto him. Sir it is peryllous for to do deeds of arms
with you when that kings dye / but I can you good thank for that ye have done
so well for his soul / for all his friends shall thank you and give you great
price. Ponthus said things that ought to be shall fall / ye ought not for to
be full glad ye shall have none dower because ye set never foot in his bed
with him / and thus he bourded with her and talked of many diverse things. And
than he went to the king and to his barons and said. Sir ye have herd how
that I have waged people for to conquer with the help of Ihesu the realm
that should be mine which that the sarasynes occupye and keep / so would I
feign and it pleased your highness to have of the men of your realm such as
will take wages / and I shall truly pay them for half a year. A said the
king / sone ye ought not for to ask / but take my men at your will to
conquer your heritage and my tresoures and all that ever I may have / and if
it pleases you I would con you good thank to suffer me to go in your
felawshyp / for I am old and so it should be but little loss of me / and also
in better nor in more profitable service for my soul might I not dye than in
the service of god. Ponthus thanked him hyghly / and said that at this time he
should not go / but he should abide at home and keep his country / and as for
tresoure he would none have of hy^ / for god had sent him enough for this
need and other to / but he refused not his men / for it be they of the world
that he most loved / and in whom he most trusts at a great nede^ The
barons and the knights of Brytayne had great Joy of this going / and every
man arrayed him for to go / every man proffered for to go with him and he thanked
them all / and tha^ he said unto them that every man should be ready within.xv.
days after at vennes / and ordained by all the costs to seek ships and
vytayl for to be at that day ready. Every baron arrayed him and stuffed him of
vessels / and of men of arms the best that they might find.

How Ponthus made a mau^dement of brytons poyteuynes / normans and angeuynes
for to go in to galyce to conquer his country yt the sarasynes held.


POnthus sent for the Barons of Anioye / of main / of poytow / and of other
countres about and he said yt he would write unto them. So he sent to Geffrey
de lesygnen / and Androwe de la toure over al men / and it was told him that
two were late comen home from beyond the sea / from the realm of germany
where as they had been well a two year in war against the sarasynes. A said
Ponthus they ben good knights and worthy men well is he felawshypped that has
them in his company. Than were there sent letters to them / and to diverse
other by the countrees about / as in to normandy. Anioye. Main. Toreyne and
poytow / to them that they subposed that had will for to adventure themself to
get worship / that they ben assembled with hy^ the.xviii. day aftee at the
toure of derbondell fast by thalamount / and there they shall find ships
and fyluer / and so the messangers departed And when the barons and the
knights herd the tidings of him / and how the sarasynes held his realm
they had all great Joy for to go / and every man was ready at that day
assygned. Ponthus sent thrughe all the countrees gold and silver for to get
ships in brytayne / in to normandy / poytow for to come some to vennes and
some to sable daulon in poytow.

THan after that Ponthus sent for his great ship / and sent for a part of
his riches for to come unto vennes against the day of his marriage he sent many
rich presents to Sydoyne of crowns / of sercles / of gyrdelles / of
chapelettes / of purses / of perles / of gold / of purple / of precious stones
/ and of margaretes that it was meruayll for to se the great riches that it was
worth / for it was praised more than thyrty thousand besauntes of gold. The
king saw them and said to his daughter. Fair daughter ye be not married to
prince dyssheryted / god has given him and you fair good and rich / and
noble lo ye ought to thank god. After that Ponthus gave to the king right
fair gifts and good Iewelles / as precious stones / perles / and cups of
gold / and to the barons of Brytayne he gave gifts of gold and riches after
that they were he was much praised for his great gifts and of his great
largess. The day of the marriage were the lords of England / of Irlonde and
of scotlonde rychely arrayed / and they of brytayne did them great worship.
Great was the feast and great was the Joy of mynstrelles and of heraldes.
Great gifts gave them Ponthus. There was many rhynges between ye courses. And
there were made many meruayllous things. Ponthus made auowe which was much
spoken of / for he said thus because that men should not say the kings
daughter has taken a man without land / therefore I make mine auowe that never
shall I come in her bed till that I be lord of the realm and land which
was my faders / and crowned or else I shall dye therefore. And I auowe to god
yt I never kyssed her / nor required her of thing that should turn to
disworshyp / when that I departed out of this country / nor thought more to
do unto her than unto mine own mother. So he said thus because of the words
the king had meued before time / for the which he departed from brytayne. And
wha^ Sydoyne wyste yt he had made this auowe she was right Joyful thereof / all
though she had lever have had his felawshyp / so it was much spoken of some
said that he was a right good man and a true knight / and some said that he
had delayed the great frendshyp and disporte that she supposed to have had
with him. Than said the king in good faith I was to hasty to believe such
tales so lightly. The feast was right great / but the king would not that year
should be Iustes for the adventure of that befell of the king of bourgoyne for
fere that some myschefe should have befallen. And than they began to sing and
dance and made many ge^tylmanly dysportes. And at even Ponthus came in to the
chamber to Sydoyne and said unto her. A my sweet love and all my Joy / my
heart / my life / and all my sustynaunce. I have been to hasty of the auowe that
I have made / but in good faith I made it for to save your worship / for the
wicked tongues of the world are always ready to report the worste. And for
troth my fair love I shall suffer greter disease than any body / for the
great desire that I have to be between your arms / but and god will I shall be
there hasty for it is the gretest desire that mine heart has. My sweet love
and lord said she wot it well that all your pleasure is mine / and we ought
to desire no thing so much as worship and good name / so ye have done well
for to put away the doubt of the mysse sayers. Inoughe they talked together /
and than they halsed and kyssed / there was much Joy and feestynge of arms
till the.xv. days were passed. There was ye monstre and the brytons were
nombred four thousand five hundred armed men. And of the normans twelve
hundred / and were all waged and paid for six months It was a fair thing
for to se them assemble with the navy of England.

How Ponthus departed from Brytayne for to go ^onquere his country.


PPonthus took his leave of ye king and of Sydoyne. And by flatery this
Guenelet did so much that he abode with the king and with Sydoyne as all
governor and keeper of them. And Ponthus took him a party of his tresoure to
keep. So at the departing there was weeping enough of Sydoyne and of the
ladies. Ponthus kyssed her and took his leave and betoke her the most part of
his Iowelles and richesse to keep. Than he departed and went by land and
passed by nauntes / and came to sable danlon and to derbendelles there was his
great navy. And there arrived Geffrey de lesygnen / and Androwe de la toure
with great felawshyp. And than Ponthus received them with great Joy as the
two knights strangers of the world that he loved best / than he gave them
great gifts And than came Guyllam de roches a good knight Paraunt de
rocheforte / the lord de douay. Pyers de done. Gerarde de chateau goutyer.
John meleurier with the herupoys. Of the manseaus, beaunmount la vale. Sygles
de doncelles and other of the country of main. Of Tourayne baussay mayle hay /
and of other tourangeaus. Of poytw / the vycount of toures / the earls brother
of march / maulyon chastemur / la garnache and diverse other. Ponthus gave them
great gifts that they all were abashed of his largess / and said that there
was none to serve him / he is worthy to conquer and to govern all the world
by his great courtesye and largess. To every baron and knight he delivered
ships after that they had people. And than they took the sea and departed
with great Joy. It tarried not long that all the navy assembled / so it was a
good sight to se the ships and the sails drawn up that it seemed a great
forest. So they had wind at will and passed the isle of doloron. And when they
were a.vi. mile from the columpne. Ponthus made the ancres for to be cast and
all the ships to abide / and he said to the lords and to the chyefteynes /
it were good to enter in to the country by night for the moon shyneth / and
therefore let us land a three or four mile from columpne / and than to
withdraw our navy again / for I would not said Ponthus that they of ye
country should know us for certain causes. Than he ordained about ye son
going down that they should depart and so they did. And so they londed a
four mile from the cite of columpne. When they were londed they sent their
ships in to the high see / because that they should not be aspyed. Than they
hid them in a valey under a great wood and held themself as preuy as they
might.

How Ponthus found his uncle the Earl of desture and sir Patrycke ye knight in
a chapel by columpne.


THan Ponthus took an horse and rode out at the wood side for to se if he might
fy^de any man of the country for to wete and to know the rule of the land.
So it befell yt he came to a little chapel right devout. It happened of
fortune yt the earl of desture Ponthus uncle and sir Patrycke ye knight yt
saved him and his.xiii. felawes were risen before day. So these two knights
loved together as brethren and they had saved the people from the death and
made them to yield trybute to the hethen king in abiding the mercy of god of
their delyuernaunce. So they were up before day to come on pilgrimage to that
chapel that they should not be aspyed of ye sarasynes. So it befell wha^
Ponthus saw ye chapel he went thither and a light and went in / and it was
in the spring of the day so he looked and saw two men knelynge before ye
auter for the which he had great Joy / for he supposed they were christian men
sith they were in ye chapel in their prayers. And when ye two knights herd
him come they were sore aferde / and wend to have been aspyed of the sarasynes.
And Ponthus asked them what they were / name you hardely and tell me what ye
be and what law ye hold of / said Ponthus and god will I shall not hyde my
name nor my god / for in good faith I am a christian man / tha^ said his uncle ye
be right welcome for your felawshyp pleases us well / and also we be christian
men in heart / but we pray you that ye well tell us what ye be. In good faith
said he my name is Ponthus / and I was ye king of galyce sone / when his uncle
the earl of desture herd it he ran to him his arms abroad and halfed him
and kyssed him and said. A my right dear neuewe blessed be god that he has
given me the grace that I may se you or I dye. When Ponthus saw that he was
his uncle and felt the good chere and the good will yt he made him / he had
great Joy and said unto him. For the love of god sir what ye give me great Joy
in mine heart if it be as ye say. The day began for to wexe clear / so each of
them knew other / and when they knew they kyssed / and wept both two and
neither might speak a word / and when they might speak the earl said. A fair
lord and neuewe how durst ye come hyder thus allone / for if ye be aspyed ye
are like to be deed. Fair uncle said he I am not allone / but I have here with
me more than.xxviii. thousand men of arms / as of the flower of England / of
Scotlonde / of Irlonde / of Brytayne / and of other countrees about. When his
uncle herd it he kneled down and Joined his hands / and thanked god hyghly
of his grace / than he told him the governance of the land / and how the
country and the people were saved / but that they yield trybute to the king
Broadas. And than he showed him sir Patrycke the knight that had saved him. And
they twain had saved all the country Ponthus came to him and took him in his
arms and said that he was all his. So they spoke enough of diverse things. And
Ponthus led them for to se his meyny / and when they saw them they had
great Joy It behooves said the two knights that ye ordeyne you your bataylles.
And so he made his ordinance and set in a valey four thousand men of arms
that when the king should come out of the town for to fight / they should
fall behind him that he should not withdraw again to ye town. And also they
delivered to sir Patrycke five hundred men of arms for to lay in a certain
place that when the king and all his power were come out of the twone / they
should go in as though they were sent for to keep the town / and thus it was
ordained among them. Than said sir Patrycke / fair lords this assemble is
made by the pourueyaunce of god that has sent us Ponthus the ryghtfull lord
of this country. The Earl of desture saw his sone Polydes yt which was a
right goodly knight / so he kyssed him and made him great Joy. Than said the
earl of desture / lord set you in ordinance / for I shall goo tell the
king Broad as that christian men are entered for to rob this country / and he
shall come out with as many men as he may and shall come rennynge without any
ordinance / wherefore he shall be the more easy for to dyscomfyte. And send ye
forth a little balyngere for to fetch a three score ships to come to the
land and set some house on fire / so he shall not know of your great power
/ wherefore he shall come all dysarayed / and without making any ordinance.
Than the Earl took his leave and departed and came to the town reght erly / he
came to the king as a man afraid / the king rose up and he salewed him by
mahowne / and than he said to the king. Sir the christian men be come for to
pyll and to rob your country / and they ben but two mile from the town be
they many said the king. Sir I wot never / but as I may apperceyue there ben
a three score ships. Fie said he be they no more / by mahowne in an evil time
be they come. So I shall tell you / for I dremed this night that I became a
great black wolf / and yt ye set vpone me a great white greyhounde and a
braket and yt the greyhounde slew me. A sir said the earl to the king ye
ought not to believe in dremes / ye say troth said the king. Go and make to
blow up the trumpettes / and do cry that every man do arm them So we shall
take the false rybaudes and robbers on the sea / the which I shall make them
all to be slain and to be drawn at the horse tails Ye say well said the earl
which thought it should not go so. The earl went forth and armed him / and
made to cry that every man should arm them. So every man armed them and lepte
on horsbacke. The king was rychely armed and went out of the town without
making of any ordinance / but who so might go went. So there went forth mo
than.xii. thousand on horsbacke with out footmen archers and arbelasters /
and of such as had none horses.

How Ponthus slew Broadas yt slew his fader.
Ponthus had ordened his bataylles and set in a valey four thousand me^ of
arms for to fall between them and the town. And sir Patrycke came with his
five hundred fyghters in to a preuy place for to win the town / and he abode
till that he saw his time to depart. The king smote his horse with the spores to
yt part where he saw ye smoke toward ye see and saw not past a.iii. score
ships / now on them they be all shente / their god shall never save them but
yt they shall dye an evil death / he abode not till he was passed the place
where the.iiii. thousand men were / than he beheld before him and saw ye
great bataylles in ordinance / so he was ameruayled of this deed / and wend
to have withdrawn hy^ for to have set his men in ordinance / and he ordained
a great party for he was a wise knight and an hardy in arms / and as he made
his ordinance he herd a great cry between him and the twone and saw his men
flee toward him Than he said there is no fleing / let us run upon them
sharply. So he smote the horse with the spores and assembled with the
bataylles. So he Iusted with Geffrey de lesygnen the which was not all ready /
and they gave great strokes / but the king took Geffrey at a trauers and
ouerthrewe him. The king laid hand on his sword and cried mahowne help /
and the first that he smote he bette down to the earth and did meruayllous
deeds of arms. The battle began right hard and sharp. Ponthus that had
great desire for to do deeds of arms in especyall upon them that held his
realm / he smote on the right side and on the left. and bette down sarasynes
and horses and slew all that ever he smote. The sarasynes held them about
their king which slew and maimed many of our men. Androwe de la toure saw
Geffrey de Lesygnen on foot that might not lepe up again / and was sore bruised
and in great peril / he smote a turk and over threw him and took his horse
and led it maugre them al to Geffrey and said unto him / fair felawe lepe up
/ for here is a peryllyous abiding on foot. Geffrey lept up and thanked him /
and when they two were together they made great slaughter upon ye sarasynes /
well beftyred them the brytons and the herupoys. There was great cry / and the
king did blow a trumpet and gadered his meyny together / and gave a strong
battle to our men. Ponthus looked about and apperceyued the king yt had
slain his fader / and also by hy^ many men were slain for he did great deeds
of arms with his body / he is right rychely armed and has a crown upon his
helm Ponthus had great Joy that he had found him and went toward him and
gave him a great stroke / and the king smote him again / so there was strong
batayl between them / for the king was right strong and of great heart / but
Ponthus gave him so many great strokes that he made him all astonyed and to
stoop and kytte the lace of his helm. And the king had tha^ no more strength
nor might no longer endure. Ponthus smote him well with all his strength and
smote a two his neck under his helm so that he fell down deed. And when his
men saw it they bette their hands and were all dyscomfyted / and on the other
side the four thousand came behind and kept them in so that there escaped
none but all went to the sword. They were all put to ye death without any
mercy. Sir Patrycke went out of his enbusshement / and came first with fyfty
armed men for to get the gate of the town / and commanded yt the remenaunt
should follow after. So he came to the cite and they knew him well. And they
asked him how it went with the king and his people / and he said right evil.
Than entered sir Patrycke and wanne the gate / and kept it till the remenau^t
came to him / than he set good keeping at the gate and badde that no man should
enter in till Ponthus came Than went he in to the town seeking the houses of
the sarasynes / and tho that he found he put to the death. So sir Patrycke
went cryenge thrughe the town. A morte sarasynes and live christian. The
christian men that were in the town that were in seruage and yolden true / they
made a cross with their arms so they found no body that did them harm / nor
of no thing that longed to them / for sir Patrycke had so ordained it. The
town was won / for all men of defense were gone unto the battle where as
they were slain. So there was more than.xxxv. thousand slain. When the
dyscomfyture was done every man sought the feldes for to find his friends his
cosyn or his master. So there was not many slain of great men of name Of
brytayne there was found deed of barons and of knights. Geffrey dauncemys /
and Bryaunt de pount. Rowlande de corquyan. Henry de Syan. Bernabe de saint
Gyle / and many other hurt / but they stood in no peril of death. Of ye
herupoys Hubert de craon. Pyers de chenulle / and of knights. Thybault de
bryse. Hamelyn de mountlayes / and Eustace de la poyssouner. Of poyteuynes.
Androwe de la march. Johan garnage and Hubyn dargenton / and of knights.
Amaulry de la forest / and Henry de basoches / and of Main. Ardenne de sylle /
and Olyuer de do^celles / and of knights Grayue de cusses. Guyllam du sages.
Of normans. Richard tesson. Guy paynell / and Pyers de vyllyers and well a
five knights more. And for England and Scotlonde there were few slain / for
they were in ye rerewarde and they of the low marches bare the brute / for
they were in the forewarde. And Ponthus commanded to take all these bodies and
to be buried in the great church of columpne / and did ordeyne all ye service
and worship that might be done for them / in so much that every man praised
him for his good deeds. The christian people were serched and laid together / the
deed on the one side / and the hurt on ye other side. When this was done.
Ponthus and his bataylles rode unto the town. There was delivered to every
lord after that he was of men / streets and houses and they found so much
riches and vytayll that the poorest had enough. It was cried that no man
should take naught from the christian people of the town nor to do them no
wrong.

How Ponthus was crowned king of galyce / and how he offered his horse and his
harnays.


POnthus rode straight to ye great church and offered up his horse and his
harnays / and did do sy^ge three masses / and knelynge weeping full sore
thanking god of his great grace. After yt the earl his uncle and sir Patrycke
came to hy^ and asked cou^seyl what they should do / and sir Patrycke said I
counsel before all things yt to the^ yt have any charge or kepy^ge of towns
castelles or fortresses be letters wryte^ to them as it were from their king
that after the sight of ye letters they come to this town both day and night
in all ye haast they may / and some shall be taken here / and some shall be
taken by enbusshementes that we shall lay in certain places and so we shall
have the most part of them and ever we shall have the less a do. This
counsel was holden in such manner that from towns and castelles all they
came to ye town of columpne / and some were taken in the town and put to death
/ and the remenau^t dystressed by enbusshementes. So they were overthrown in
diverse places. When the christian people that had lived in seruage herd of the
dyscomfyture of the sarasynes they rose by towns and by castelles and slew as
many of them as they might find / and so long was the war led that all
the land was cleansed and delivered of them / for some of them did yield them
and were converted / and Ponthus gave them good enough to live upon / and the
remenau^t that might flee they fled. whereof some were slain by ye spanyardes
and by them of ye realm of Castyle / and other perysshed in diverse places
myscheuously. Whereof ye Sowdan of babyloyne was sith right sorrowful / for to
have lost thus his three sons and his men / he was right angry with mahowne
and said before all men as a man out of his wit that the god crucyfyed had
overcome him and that he was of greter virtue than mahowne when he had not
saved his sons / and his men. And so there was great complaynt for them in
babyloyne and in damask. Ponthus made leches to be sought for to hele the
people that were wounded and hurt in the battle and himself vysyted them
often and made men to bry^ge them all that them neded / he fested and
felawshypped the lords and gave them great gifts. And also he found in a
toure the great tresour of king Broadas the which was a great thing to tell.
And when he had over ryden the country and cleansed of the mysoyleuers / he
found much people and the land well labored both of vynes and of corns.
From all the countrees the people came rennynge for to se their ryghtfull lord
as it had been to miracles / and they loved him well for his great renown and
worthynes his bounte and his courtesye / for there was none so simple nor so
poor but that he would speak to and here him mekely / he was right pyteuous of
the poor people / he loved god and holy church. And when he had done all his
deeds he came to the columpne to his crownaco^n where he was full solemply
crowned by the hands of the bishop / at which day he held a notable and a
royal feast. And thither came to him the king of Aragon his uncle / and that
was his moders brother the which had great Joy to se him and of his vyctorye
/ and he told him how king Broadas had warred upon him and how there was
taken a trewes between them for a certain time / in to the time that god had
set remedy and thrughe his grace he has right well purueyed of the pity by
you. Thus complained the king to his neuewe / and yet he told him that he
abode ye coming down of the king of France and the king of spain that
should have come this somer / but I thank god it is now no need. The feast was
great of the kings crownacyon / and there was made many strange things. The
great lords of the country they came and did their homage. And also the fair
ladies had great Joy that they were comen out of hell and of seruage where
as they had lived in sorrow and heaviness / and now they be aswaged in to Joy
and might and in to paradyse as them seems. They lyked well their king in so
much that they had Joy to look upon him / and all manner of people thanked god
hyghly of their delyueraunce. There was songs and many mynstrelsyes which
were to long to tell.

How Ponthus knew his mother among ye poor people that went asky^nge their
bread for gods sake and how he put his crown upon her heed.
THe king did bring and present by.xii. fair ladies and.xii. old knights
great gifts and Iowelles to the good knights and chyeftaynes / some of fair
coursers and other of fair cups of gold and silver / of fair clothes of
gold and of sylke and many other great Iowelles / so yt all men were
ameruaylled of his largess. He was a man right pleasant and of great
courtesye and of good condycyons. So there befell a great meruayll for the
custom was that before the king should be served.xiii. poor people for the
love of god and his apostles. So it befell the earl went vysytynge the tables
as god would / he beheld the table of the poor people / and saw a woman that
looked upon the king / and as she beheld him the teeres fell down from her
eyes. The earl looked upon her and auysed her so well that by a token she had in
her chynne he knew well that it was ye queen mother unto king Ponthus And when
he knew her and saw her in so poor estate that her gown was all to clouted
and all to rent / he might not keep him from wepy^ge so his heart swymmed for
pity to se her in so poor array. And when he might speak he thanked god and
went behind the king his neuewe and said to him. Sir here is a great
meruayll / whereof said the king. The best and ye holiest lady that I know my
lady the queen your mother is here in / where is she said he / and he with great
pain might tell him for pity / and when he might speak he told him in
counseyll. Sir se her yonder with the.xiii. poor folk at ye first end / and ye
king Ponthus beheld her and she apperceyued it and put her hode before her
eyes and wept. And the king had great pity in his heart and said unto his
uncle. Fair uncle make no semblaunt that none aspye it but when we are up fro
the table I shall goo in to the warderobe and thither bring her pryuely to me /
and so it was done. When the tables were taken up and graces yelden to god /
the king departed pryuely and went in to his warderobe and the Earl of
desture his uncle brought thither the queen his mother pryuely. And when kyge
Ponthus saw her he kneled down before her / and took his crown and set it on
her heed. And she took him up all weeping and kyssed him / often she kyssed him
and halsed him / and sore they wept she and her sone and the earl And when
they might speak / king Ponthus said unto her. A madame so much pouerte and
disease ye have suffered and endured. A my sweet knight and sone said she I am
come out of the pains of hell and god has given me paradyse when it has
pleased him to give me so long life that I may se you with mine eyes / and
that I se vengeance for my lord your fader that tho tyrau^tes put to the death
/ and also that I se the country voyded of the messebyleuers / and the holy
law of Ihesu christ to be served / and I wot well that this trouble and
sorrow has endured well a.xiii. year as by chastysynge of god / for the great
delytes and lusts that were used in this realm / so me seems now that god
has mercy on his people that he has kept you and sent you for to deliver
the country of the mysbyleuers. Right well spoke the queen and wisely as an
holy lady that she was. Now I pray you said the king tell me how ye escaped /
and how ye were saved Fair sone I shall tell you / when ye cry was great in
the town in ye morning and your fader slain. I was in my bed and your
fader armed him with an hawberke and his helm / and ran forth without any more
abiding as the hardyest knight that was as men said. When he was departed and
herd the cry I was sore a ferde / and took one of my womennes gowns and
went my way with my launder I found of adventure the posterne open yt some
people had opened / so I went out and went to the woods fast by the lands
/ where as dwelled an holy heremyte the which had a chapel and a lodge at the
wodes side. So I abode there and my chamberer which was aged came every day
to fetch the alms at the kings house. And thereby we lived the heremyte she
and I / and so ye may se how / god has saved me. In good faith said ye king
her sone ye led an holy life / and so did she for she wered ye hair and
went gyrde with a cord and was an holy lady. The king had great Joy and
great pity of his mother. Than he sent for his taylloures and did shape
kyrtelles gowns and mantelles for his mother of velvet both blewe and purple
and made them to be furred with veer and ermyne and fables / and when it came
to their souper they brought in the queen rychely arrayed. And when the king of
Aragon her brother saw her he took her in his arms and kyssed her and said
that he wend not that she had been on live. The lords and the ladies of Galyce
had great Joy of the queen and did her great worship / for they held her for
a good and an holy lady. And they were all ameruaylled fro whens she came / for
they wend she had be deed. Her brother the king of Aragoon was set at souper
at the tables end / and after the queen and than her sone / the king Ponthus
for the day of his crownacyon he must keep his estate The queen was of goodly
port and seemed well to be a great lady / she was right humble and had great
Joy of the goodness and worship that she saw in her sone. Than she said to her
sone. Fair sone I have great desire for to se our daughter your wife for the
great goods I have herd of her. Madame said he ye shall se her hastily if it
please god. That day passed with great Joy and great dysportes of ladies of
singing of daunsynge / and of other manner plays. That night king Ponthus
dremed that a bear devoured queen Sydoyne his wife and she cried and said. A
Ponthus my sweet lord suffer me not thus to dye. This auysyon fell to hy^
twyes or thryes / so he was sore afraid there with and great meruayll in his
heart what it mente In the morning in the spring of the day he called up his
men and sent for his uncle and sir. Patrycke / so they came to him and he
told them his auysyons / and he said mine heart tells me that my wife has
some sekenes or in some trouble / so I will no longer abide here / for I will
go as fast as I can to se her. When they saw his will they durst not again
say him. Than said the king / fair lords I thank god and you this country
is cleansed of the myssebyleuers / and I think well yt by you two the country
has be saved and the people kept fro the death by your good rule as it was
gods will. So I bethynke me of Moses and Aaron that god set to save the
people of Israel / so ye shall have merit and the guerdon of god. And as for
me I am right much bound to you / wherefore fair uncle I make you my
leutenau^t / and sir Patrycke shall be senesshall and constable of this realm
/ for it is great reason that ye that have done so much good and saved the
country ye to have the rule and the governance. And ye sir Patrycke my dear
friend ye saved me / so I shall give you land and good so largely yt ye shall
not lose your good service. Sir Patrycke kneled down and thanked him. Than the
king commanded them that the estate of ye queen his mother were kept / and
that she should have her commandment as it were to his own propre person /
and also yt they should sustain the poor as well as the rich and that the
rich should not grieve nor ouerlay the poor. And than he commanded them to
repair chyrches and glass wyndowes / and of all other things where as they
were broken to make them up again / and I shall take you ten thousand
besauntes of gold thereto / he ordained right well for his realm all things
that neded. And than he went and herd his masses and sent his dinner in to the
ship and took his leave of his mother the queen and said unto her herynge all
men. Madame I leave you the realm and the tresoure that I have all in your
grace and governance. I have commanded and command all men to obey you as I
my propre person and better I leave you mine uncle and sir Patrycke my good
knight yt which I have made my constable and seneshall of this realm and mine
uncle my leutenaunt. So he took his leave weeping / and she prayed him that he
would come again in short time / for she would feign se his wife / and he
took his leave of the lords and the ladies of the country and went to the
ships / and every man arrayed him and dressed him to the sea. King Ponthus
came unto ye bar^ns and told them what auysyon there was befall him /
wherefore he should never be at hertes ease till he had seen his wife. So he took
the sea and sailed so long till he saw the costs of Brytayne.

Of ye false letters and treason that Guenelet did against Ponthus / wherefore
he dyed with great myschefe as ye shall here hereafter.
GUenelet was abyden keeper of the king and of his daughter / for king Ponthus
had given him all the governance as ye have herd before wherefore he had great
Joy. Nevertheless he might not keep himself nor chastyse himself from
treason / so he bethought him that he would have the queen Sydoyne to his wife
by what way and that he would be lord and king of the country either by
fair or by foul / and so he would set himself in adventure. So the devil
tempted him so much yt he did stuff the cite and the castelles and sent for
sowdyours and gave them silver in hand for to have the love of them of arms.
So is silver of an evil virtue for the good men put them in peril of death.
And wha^ he had stuffed all the fortresses he did make a falls seal of king
Ponthus and made two false letters that one to the king and that other to the
queen Sydoyne / the which specyfyed that king Ponthus reco^maunded him to the
king / and that all his men were dyscomfyted and slain and himself hurt to
the death without any remedy So he prayed him that for his welfare and for the
wealth of the country that he would give his daughter unto Guenelet / and that
better he might not besette her. And for to make the marriage he gave him all
his tresour that he brought out of England. The letters were right well
devised / and in the letter of queen Sydoyne was how he prayed her and required
her for the love that was between the^ that she would take Guenelet his cosyn.
And when the king and his daughter saw the letters / it is not to ask of the
great sorrow that they made and heaviness. Queen Sydoyne swowned often and
wept and wysshed after him the which might not out of her mind / she drew
and rent her fair here and made so great sorrow that it was pity to se So
the ladies and all the country were in great heaviness for him and said. Alas
what damage what pity / the flower of knyghthode / the flower of all gentylnes
/ my roure of all good manners. And the common people they wept and sorowed for
their friends and for their kynnefor they wend yt they all had been deed. There
might no man comfort queen Sydoyne. Alas said she he where as all bounte and
troth dwelled in / and by whom I thought to have all Joy the which was so
free / and so true / and loved me so well / and was so lykly to have hold the
people in rest and peace / how has god suffered such an adventure against him and
against me. Alas so rowfull creature what shall I do. So there was none so hard
an heart but that he should have had pity on her. This sorrow dured more than
eight days with out any cessynge. And Guenelet came and said to the king how
that king Ponthus required him that he should give him his daughter / so he
flatered him right fair and said that he should serve him and her / and
worship them and keep them and the realm. And that king Ponthus had given him
gold and silver more than the realm was worth. So he offered it to hy^ and
said. Sir I pray you go speak with your daughter that she will consent. The
king was aged so he wyste not what to say. And Guenelet did so much by his
subtle wit that he made the king to consent. The king came to his daughter
and comforted her in the fairest wise that he might and said unto her that
dyscomforte did but grieve her without any help to her nor to his realm. And
sith that king Ponthus required it that she should have Guenelet that for the
love of him. And for the great tresour that he had given him / and also that
he should obey unto him and keep his realm / for said the king he is wise and
shall abide in this realm for to rule it / for if I gave you to any king he
would led you in to his country / and so should this land abide without any
gouernoure / when queen Sydoyne had herd her fader thus speak she had great
meruayll / and said that and god be pleased he shall not be her husbonde / and
that she should rather dye. And than the king that loved her so much said
^yth that it pleases you not ye shall not have him / but ^adde her be of good
comfort. So he came to Guenelet and said his daughter would have none
husbonde at this time. O said Guenelet refuses she me / it shall not be al at
her will. So he came to her and made much of her and gave her fair langage
how that he thought to serve her and to obey her and she to be lady of all /
and that no thing shall be done in the realm but by her commandment / and
how he has the tresoure of her said lord that was won upon the sarasynes
the which was given him by his letters. Much made he of her and flatered her
/ but always it auaylled not for she swore unto him that she should not be
wedded of all that year for man that speaks with tongue. O said he if your
fader command you will ye dysobey him My lord may command me what soever
it pleases him said she / but for to dye I shall abide all this year / after
say I not but that I will obey him / ye said Guenelet make ye refuse of me /
and will ye not obey the letters of your foresaid lord the which ye desired
and loved so much / and that there was no thing but that ye would do for
him. And sith ye list not to obey him / nor to his prayer / nor to his letter
/ and also ye list not to obey the commandment of your fader. By ye faith I
owe to him but if ye take other counseyll I doubt that ye will be angered / so
he thretened her when by fayrenes he might not have her. And than he said sith
that he has the letter of her foresaid lord / and the consent of the king her
fader / that she should do it whyther she would or not / ye said she am I in
that party / ye said he by my faith ye shall se what shall befall. Rather said
she I shall suffer every lymme of me to be hewn from other / ye said he it
shall be seen all betyme. So he departed as a mad man / for he wened not to
fail of her Queen Sydoyne was all abashed and thought in her heart that it
was not the first treason yt he had done. Soo^ she thought well that the
letters should be falfe / for other times he had done understand yt king
Ponthus thus was deed / so called she two squyers and.iii. yemen of her chamber
that she had / and called Elyos and two other gentylwomen / and said unto them
that doubted her of Guenelet / and showed them how he was hot wenynge to have
her either by fair or by foul / for he is malycious and perauenture he would
work by stryngth So I have purposed we shall go in to yonder toure / and do
bear thither some vytayll and there shall we abide unto ye time we have some
rescowe of our friends or some of the barons / or else have herd the troth
of my lord king Ponthus.

How Guenelet menassed Sydoyne the which had drawn in to a toure.


THey did bear bread and wine in botelles / and barelles and in pottes /
flesh and chese and all thing that them neded as long as they had layser /
and than they shette the door with ye bars / and bare up rocks and stones
for to defend it / for Guenelet had thought for to take it against her will and
for to have done her outrage if she would not have consented. So he came in to
her chamber / and when he found her not he serched the warderobe where he
found a gentylwoman which told him she was withdrawn in to the toure / and
how she had vytaylled it and stuffed it. And when he herd it he looked as a
madman and came before the toure and prayed her full fair that she should open
him the door and swore by his faith that he would not mysse do her / but queen
Sydoyne which knew well his untruth said that he should not come in. But
when he saw that he might not come in by that mean / he thretened her sore
and swore that he should take her by force / and make her his wenche if she
would not be his wife / and badde her chose which that she would. A said she
which that was angry to here tho ungoodly words. Traytoure thou shalt not
come thereto and god will / for thou shalt dye an evil death for this false
enterprise. Than he waxed angry and said sith that he had done so much he
would fynysshe it what so ever befall. So he took the king and put him in
prison for fere that he should gader no men of arms against him. And than he
came to the bourgeys and said unto him how queen Sydoyne was given him of her
husbonde by good letters / and also the king her fader was accorded thereto
hycause that she would have be wedded to a man of naught the which would have
hated and dystroyed ye country / but said he if I have her I shall keep the
fraunchyses and lybertees / and shall keep you as gold does the stone. So I
have set the king in a chamber for he is al doted and has no wit / and he
would lightly consent unto the lewd courage of his daughter / whereby the
country should be lost if it befell as they think / but I shall keep them well
therfro with gods help and youres for to save the welfare of brytayne. So he
gave largely to them that he supposed might noye him / and he did it in such
wise / wenynge to them that he had said troth / wherefore they durst not ones
arise nor meue / and also he had many strange sowdyours.

How Guenelet made to assail the toure where as Sydoyne was in.


When he had spoken with the bourgeys and ye people he came to the toure and
assailed it. So there was within but.v. men and four women that threw down
great stones and defended the toure well / and also there was the most part
of them yt did but feign / for they would not that she should be taken The
assaute lasted a great while. And wha^ Guenelet had failed he was right
sorrowful and angry and thought at ye leest he would have enfamysshed them. In
good faith said queen Sydoyne we have vytayll enough for a month or more /
and in the mean time god shall help us and send us rescowes. And when
Guenelet understood her he wend to have run mad for anger for he was all
dystraught because he failed of his purpose / and would and wysshed yt he had
never begone / but sith that he has undertaken it he will fynysshe it or else
dye therefore. So he set good watch and wards about the toure that there
should no vytayll come to them / and than he bethought him of a great malice /
for he came to the king and prayed him that he would go to his daughter for he
woteth well yt he should turn her of her folly that she has taken in hand /
and told him that he would not famysshe her but fall to a trety The king was
good and true and thought none harm but went to his daughter and told her
how she was in way to be deed and showed her many ensamples. And she answered
him to the contrary / and how he thought well the letters were false / and ye
wot well said she that other times has he said that he was deed. So I shall
rather dye but if I know ye very troth. In good faith said the king it may
well be as ye say / for I know no man of knowledge that has been there and
hard it is where as none escapes. So they ben somewhat comforted for the great
untruth that they know in him. Guenelet asked the king that he saw above at
the wyndowe. Sir what will she do. So help me god said the king I may not
speed / for she is yet all sorrowful and angry for her lord / wherefore I may
have no good answer. No said Guenelet by the holy faith ye shall abide with
her and bear her felawshyp for to ete pesen and plommes / for ye shall both
two dye for honger or I shall have her. So the king abode with his daughter /
wherefore she had the sooner pity for the honger and disease of her fader. Four
days or five they had mete enough but at the syxte day their vytaylles failed
them / for them had neither bread nor flesh. So they were two days that they
ete no mete save a little chese / and each of the^ a draught of wine. The king
began to feeble sore. Queen Sydoyne had no more but six apples whereof she gave
her fader every day two / she wept and sorowed for the great disease that her
fader was in / and that did her more sorrow than her own. So looked often times
out at a wyndowe toward ye see / if she might se any thing come. So she
wysshed often times after her lord king Ponthus and than she wept and made
great sorrow desiring her own death and said to the king. A my lord it had been better for you that I had been deed long ago than to give you such a pain
or that ye had suffered so much honger for me. The king wept and said I had
lever dye f^r honger rather than yonder traitor should have you by this mean
Queen Sydoyne called him and said / falls traitor how may thou suffer the
king to dye which is so good a man. Alas said she is it ye norture that he
has made of the when thou have besyeged and make him to dye for honger and
for thirst that often times has given the good mete and drink / is this the
guerdon that thou yeldest him. She said him much shame / but it auaylled no
thing / for he made his oath that he should made him too dye for very great
honger if she would not consent to be his. The king dyed almoost for honger
and lay in his bed and might not stere. And wha^ queen Sydoyne beheld him
she said that she had lever dye or languysshe all her life than her fader
should dye for her / than she said unto him wepy^ge. My right sweet lord and
fader I may no longer suffer your sorrow nor the honger ye abide. I have lever
to for dye or else to be in sorrow al my life languysshynge than to se you in
this plyght. The king wept and wyste never what to say for to se that he
should have his daughter by this way it grieved him sore / and on the other
side to se himself dye and her together it did hy^ harm / for they should be
cause of their own death. So he sorowed sore and said that he had to long
lived / so he could not counseyll himself and said unto her. Fair daughter I
wot never how we may be auysed nor what counseyll I may give you so much
sorrow I have / but for to se you dye I may not suffer it. And I would that the
death took me so that king Ponthus were on live in the town on ye stronger
party / for he would avenge him well on the traitor yt would have you against
your will. And the squyers and the gentylwomen the which were at the death and
wood for honger as it was no meruayll for it was passed four days and more
that they had eten no manner of thing / and they said. Madame ye shall be cause
of the death of the king your fader / of you and us / it were better to take
the unhappy man than for to do wors. When she saw that she must needs do it
for to save her fader more than for her own death that she recked not of / she
said that sith it is so she shall do her will. Than she went to ye wyndowe and
did call Guenelet and he came so she turned again and sent her fader and
badde him to speak to Guenelet / and if he might find none other remedy that
ye should accord with him so that he have.viii. days or more of respyte if ye
may to recover us of the honger and sorrow that he has set us in. The king
rose up and spoke to Guenelet and she wed him that by strength he should never
get ye love of her / and that he would leave his enterprise and he should give
him towns and castelles or what thing yt he would have. He answered again yt
he would not take all ye realm but yt he would have her sith yt her lord had
given her to him. Than said the king here is but little reason. I doubt me yt
ye will not rejoice her long. All auayled not yt the king said for he was
more in cursydnes than he was before. And said not for to dye he would leave his
enterprise what so ever befall. The king asked him a months respyte and at
the months end he should give hy^ an answer. And Guenelet would right
naught do but the king did so much yt he had four days of respyte and
after the four days he should wedde her / and that she consented thereto. And
thus was the matter agreed and sworn / and yet said Guenelet yt she should not
depart out of ye coure till the day came yt should be wedded / he had great
Joy and did bear her every day of the best metes that he might find / and
than he held the king well auysed. After the fourth day the feast and the
array was great / for Guenelet flyed for Joy for to have so fair a lady that
he loved so much. The king went and fetched her down and she came all be
wept / and was so heavy that she had lever have dyed than lived / and wysshed
in her heart after her lord king Ponthus and said Alas in an evil hour was
I borne / for simple change have I now made. So she was led to the church
and the bishop fyaunced them and wedded them. The teres fell often and thycke
from her eyes. The mete was ordained and there was many diverse things of
trumpes / taboures / and fydelles. Right merry and Joyous was Guenelet / but I
doubt it was against his mysse adventure as it pleased god / for every man shall
be rewarded after his service / yt day was the feast right great

Here leueth to speak of them and return again to king Ponthus.
POnthus the king which was in the ships and had taken the sea and had
taken leave of his mother and of his uncle and of his Barons of the country / and
had all ordained as ye have herd before He did draw up the saylles and had
wind at will and saylled so long till they arrived in the isle of there fast
by the rochell / there took leave of him the poyteuynes the aungeuynes /
manseaus / and torengeaus. So king Ponthus took his leave of them and thanked
them much and gave them great gifts. Than he took the sea again he and the
other navy of England and of brytayne. And the wind fell all calyne / and
king Ponthus took two small Balyngers / and a three score felawes with him and
began to row Qunene Sydoyne had dremed that her lord came / wherefore she had
sent one of her squyers to the sea side to se if any think came. So he was
lepte on a courser and he beheld the two balyngers and saw in them a
standarde. So he supposed well that it was of the army of galyce wherefore he
took his hode and made a sign of calling King Ponthus beheld and said / se
yo^nder a ryder and that makes us a sign of cally^ge / and it seems as
though he had great haast or else he mocketh us haast you that we there at
him. And when he knew that it was king Ponthus he cried unto him. A sir haast
you what is there / is there any thing.

How the king Ponthus slew Guenelet in plain souper.


THan the squire told him how that Guenelet had served him from point to
point. And when king Ponthus herd this he blessed him and was ameruaylled
that ever he thought to do such great treason. Now said ye squire they shall
be anon at souper / so it shall be hard to come in. I shall tell you said
king Ponthus how we shall do / we shall dysguyse us at yonder vyllage / and we
shall go in daunsynge with pypes and tabours / and we shall bear presents
saying that we ben fellows which have great Joy of the marriage / and by that
mean we shall come in with the daunses. In good faith said the squyers it is
well said / and so it was done. King Ponthus and his fellows dysguysed them
in gowns of the good men's of the subbarbes. And they went daunsynge in to
the court. So it was nyghe ye son going down / and men let them enter in
to the hall well dysguysed. Some had hatres of straw and of grene bows / and
some had hodes stuffed with heye / some were halting / and some were croke
backed / every man made after his own guyse. Guenelet had great Joy and said
/ ye se well how the common people have great Joy of our wedding / here be
fair dysportes that they make us / but he knew not of ye bussheme^t whereby he
was sone angered* And when king Ponthus and his felawshyp had daunsed twyes or
thryes about the hall / and had behold the high deys and saw Guenelet that
made great Joy and great feast of the daunses and waited at the table. King
Ponthus came thyderwarde and cast away his dysguysynge so that every man
knew him and said to Guenelet. A tryatour false and untrue how durst thou
think so great treason against me and the king and his daughter which have
nourysshed the and done the so much good / a simple guerdon haste thou yielded
them again therefore / but now you shalt have thy payment. Guenelet beheld
him the which was all lost and wist not what to answer / for he thought he
had been deed. King Ponthus drew a little sweede right sharp and smote him so
that he claue his heed and the body to the nauyll / and after he cut of his
heed in sign of a traytoure in two pieces / and made him to be drawn out / and
commanded yt he should be borne to the gallous / when the king and his
daughter saw the king Ponthus they lepte fro the table and came rennynge
their arms abroad and halsed him and kyssed him. Queen Sydoyne wept for Joy
and kyssed his mouth and his eyes and she might not depart from him. King
Ponthus had so great pity for the disease that they had suffered that the teres
fell from his eyes so sore his heart was. And when their hertes were somewhat
lyghted the king said. Fair sone it had but little failed that ye should have
lost the sight of your wife and me. Than he told him of the great treason of
the false letters / and of the hunger that he made them to suffer. King
Ponthus blessed him and was all abashed and said that never erst was borne
such a traytoure / nor never was thought such a false treason. I bethynke me
said he of Ihesu christ yt had.xii. apostles / of the which one sold him. And
so we came hyder.xiii. fellows as it pleased god / whereof one was wors than
Judas / but thanked be god he is well paid of his reward. A said the king if
ye had longer abyden ye had be yet more mocked. God would it not said king
Ponthus. Now let us leave this talking said the king / for this matter is well
fynysshed to my pleasure / and let us think for to lead Joy and dysporte /
and also tell us of your deed how ye have spedde. Right well I thank god said
king Ponthus. Than he told him of the battle and of the dyscomfyture / and
how the country was cleansed and well labored / and than there were some that
told all the rule and the manner / and how he was crowned. They had all great
Joy to here of the fair adventure that god had sent him. Than they set them
down to souper and song and daunsed and led Joy. Queen Sydoyne was merry
and glad / and it is not to ask how in her heart she thanked god mekely to be
escaped from so great peril. That night they were well eased / for both their
hertes had been in dystresse. They talked of many things and had enough of
Joy and dysporte together / for they loved full well together. They loved god
and holy church and were right charytable and pyteuous of ye poor people.
That night the sowdyours of Guenelet fled away who so might go went. All ye
people thanked god of ye coming of king Ponthus and they went on pylgrymages
and processyons yeldynge graces to god / for every man wend he had be deed.

How the earl of rychemonde took leave of Ponthus and came in to England / and
told the king of the great deeds of arms yt Ponthus had done.
ON the morrow after arrived the navy of England / of brytayne / and of
normandy / when they herd the treason of Guenelet they had much meruayll
how ever he durst think such falsenesse. The king of Brytayne received
them with great Joy. And king Ponthus withhelde with him the Earl of
Gloucestre / and well a.xii. knights more / and said that within.xv. days he
would go in to England to se the king and ye queen and her daughter Genneuer
/ and said to the earl of Rychemonde reco^maunde me to them and if my lady
Genneuer be not wedded I shall bry^ge her an husbonde / if it please the king
and her to take him. So he told him in his ere yt it was his cosyn germayne
Polydes the which was a right goodly knight and full of good condycyons and
lykely to come to great worship. In good faith said the earl ye say troth /
and I can think the king will be right glad of him and have him in great
chere for the great love he has to you. So he conveyed hy^ as f^rre as he
might and after took his leave of them. So they departed and came in to their
own country with great Joy. The earl of Rychemonde came to the court and
found the king and the queen and the king of scotts that was come to them.
The king asked him of the tidings And he told him of the beginning and
ending of all auentures. And how the country was delivered of the sarasynes /
and how that the country and the people had be saved by the Earl of desture
and sir Patrycke in such wise that it was well labored and pleopled of men by
ye trewage that they yielded whereby they lived in peace. And than he told him of
the great treason and falsenes of Guenelet / and afterward he told them of ye
great gifts the good chere and great gentylnes ye king Ponthus had showed
them. And when he had all told he called in counsel ye king and ye queen
and her daughter Genneuer and the king of scotts / and told them how king
Ponthus would come thither within.xv. days and had withholde with him the earl
of Gloucestre / and how he had spoken to him of ye marriage of his cosyn
germayne and of Genneuer. The king asked what manner knight he was and he
answered yt he was the goodlyest knight he knew save only king Ponthus / and
I tell you said he that he resembles much of person and of condycyons / save
that he is somewhat less. By my faith said the king I accord me if it please
my daughter. And she kneled down and said what it pleased him to command her
she should do. The queen and the king of scotts praised and agreed to the
marriage And ye king of scotts said / sir it needs not to mary your daughter
to a king or a lord yt would not dwell in this realm for a king or a great
lord perauenture would not dwell in this country / and that were not good for
the people nor for the country. And wete well that as long as king Ponthus
lives there shall be no man so hardy to assay to grieve his land. Than said
the king that he had said soth. Genneuer that loved so much the king Ponthus
said in her heart that the knight pleased her more than any other / and
inquired of him from far of the Earl and of the knights that have been at ye
war that have seen him / and the more that she enquyreth the better she
fyndeth. And the more she loves him. Now has she no desire so great as to se
him / and she prays unto god that he may come soon.

How king Ponthus made a great feast at vennes and a great Iustynge for to
feast ye strangers where as he won the pryse above all other.


THan king Ponthus turned again to vennes when he had conveyed the lords of
England and of the countrees beyond. So they went for to here mass / and
after they went to mete. And than said king Ponthus unto all the barons of
Brytayne. Fair lords if it pleases you we must se our ladies of this country
and feast them for the love of the earl of Gloucestre and of these knights of
England the which must be feested / and to disporte them with some deeds of
arms / for within.xv. days we must go in to England so se the king for
certain matters I have to speak with him. They answered yt it should be done.
Now quod he I charge each of you to bring of ye fairest ladies and gentylwomen
of your countries And each of you shall bring others wife and ye shall be here
by this day seven night. So this was granted and every man went to his wife
and his friends / and each of them sought of the fairest ladies and gentylwomen
and best singing and daunsynge that they might find and came to vennes. And
king Ponthus went against them and received them with great Joy of
mynstrelles and other dysportes. On the morrow after were the Iustes great.
Queen Sydoyne was on the scaffoldes and the king her fader / and the great
ladies of Brytayne and the aged knights. King Ponthus was of the inner party
/ and the earl of Gloucestre. Barnart de la roche. Gerarde de vyttry. Peers de
vyttry. Roger de loges / the vycount de donges / and Ends de doul for to Just
against all comers. So the Iustes began great and hard. King ponthus bette
down knights and horses. So every man doubted for to mete with him / the
ladies praised them much / and so did all manner men / great was the feestes
the Iustes and the dysportes / and lasted till the son going down / there
were many fair Iustes and hard strokes that long it were to tell. At even
they went and set them to souper and were served with many diverse seruyces.
Mynstrelles and heraldes led great mirth and great noise. The price of the
utter side was given to the lord mountfort / for right well and sore had Iusted
/ so he had the cup of gold. And king Ponthus had the price within and he
had a chaplet that the ladies sent him And with that came thither Geffrey de
lesygnen and Androwe de la toure. Guyllam de roches / and Leoncel de mauleon
the which king Ponthus had sent for for to go with him in to England / for
over all knights he loved them best for their worthynes / and king Ponthus
rose against them and took them in his arms and made them great chere. And they
said unto him that he had done evil to rise against them / and that he was to
courteyse and to gentle. After souper the lord de lesygnen said ye have this
day Insted with out us. And if it please you said he to king ponthus we four
yt be last come shall Just to morrow. Than said king Ponthus ye shall have
with you my cosyn Polydes and ye vycount of lion for to be.vi. for I
understand by the vycountes words this day that he was wroth because he was
not of the inner party / so we shall mow at this time ease his heart. Than he
was called and Polydes told them that to morrow they.vi. should Just against
al comers. So yt cry was made yt the white fellows should Just and deliver al
manner of knights / and he of without that should have ye price he should have
a gyrdell and a purse of the fairest lady of the feast / and he of within yt
should get ye price he should kiss her / and have of her a ry^ge of gold So
there were great Iustes and many great strokes given / but who so ever Iusted
well or not I let it pass for to abredge this story. And nevertheless the
price without was given to Geffrey de chateau bryaunt / and the price of within
to Polydes but some men said yt Geffrey de lesygnen had won it. So there was
therefore a great debate. On the morrow after king Ponthus took his leave of the
king and of Sydoyne and of the ladies of Brytayne and than he went to saint
Malo / and took the sea and led with him.xii. of the barons of Brytayne and
ye four before said. So they passed over / for the earl of Gloucestre departed
before him a day for to tell the king of England that king Ponthus came for
to se him. The king understood well by the earl of Rychemonde that he came. So
was he garnysshed and stuffed of all things that him neded for to receive him
worshypfully / with him was the king of scotts his brother / and ye king of
Irlonde / and he of cornewayle his neuewe and the earls and the barons of his
realm. So they had great Joy of his coming. The king prayed to them all for
to make king Ponthus good chere and all ye worship that might be done / for
said he ye wot well all how by him this realm was releued both of neighbors
and of sarasynes. They said all that they should do their power. The king lepte
on horsbalke and the other kings and rode against king Ponthus well a mile
with all manner mynstrelsy they received him with great Joy and great
worship. The chere that they made him is not for to tell for it was great.
King Ponthus was rychely arrayed of perles and of of precious stones and had a
cercle upon his heed of stones and of perles. The were.xx. knights with
Polydes and the.xvi. that I spoke of before and four hundred of Galyce.

How Ponthus came to London with great noblesse where ye king and the queen
received him with great Joy.
THese.xx. knights were full rychely cladde in syglatons furred with veer all
in one suit well and rychely arrayed of gyrdelles of gold and purses fair and
rich the which appeared under their furred mantelles / they were much looked
upon / and their ordynau^ces were holden for fair and good. With great Joy
entered tho king Ponthus in to London / and there he found the queen and her
daughter / and the ladies in ye country abydy^ge him. So when he saw the
queen he alyght a far and went rennynge to her ward / and she kyssed him
and halsed him and was than received with great worshyp^ The queen asked him
how he had done sith he departed from them / and he said right well. And
Genneuer the ky^ges daughter had always her eye for to se Polydes the which
she had great desire for to fe. So she knew him by the tokens and lyknes of
his cosyn king Ponthus. And she saw him so gracyous and so pleasant that she
lyked him over all things / and yet for to be the more in certain she axed of
the earl of Gloucestre / and she showed her by sign / and sith she said in her
heart that he had not failed for to chese him / and that her heart told her
well that it was he / they went to mete and there were many strange seruyces
and notably served / for the barons served by the kings commandment. After
mete they drunk and ate spyces. Genneuer had great desire that they should
speak of her matter. So she said to the king of scotts laughing. I wot never
what shall be of the speech that the earl of Rychemonde brought. And the king
smyled and said ye have seen him / what say ye by him / pleases he you / she
wexed all reed and said. I shall do as my lord and ye will. So he saw well
yt she lyked him / he came to the king and said to him that it was good to
wete of ye matter of his nece. Than said ye king of England ye say troth /
withdraw you in to yonder chamber. And the king withdrewe him and sent for
the king of Irlonde and the king of cornewayle / and for the princes and
barons of his realm. And wha^ they were come he told them how the earl of
Rychemonde had spoken to him from king Ponthus of the marriage of his daughter
and of Polydes / and he said unto them. Fair lords ye know well that I am
aged and may bear no more none arms nor labor nor trauayll for to keep you
if need befell. So it behooves that our daughter were married to a man that were
lykely to keep you and to hold you in rest and peace / if ye take a great lord
or prince perauenture he will make his dwelling in his own country so should
ye dwell without governor / and if any wrong were done to any of you or too any
of this realm he should be feign to goo out of the country to seek right of
his request / therefore me seems it were better for to take a young knight of
high kynred that should abide and dwell with you / and that would think
himself to be beholden to have worship by his wife / and in so much he should
be the more enclyned to obey you and the realm / so I will tell you all the
matter that has be spoken unto me. Than he declared them how that king
Ponthus had spoken to ye earl of Rychemonde of Genneuer and of his cosyn
germayne the which men hold for a good knight and of good condycyons. So
there was much talky^ge both of one and of other that long were to tell /
but the end was that they were al accorded and said that they might no better
do for the surete and welfare of the realm / and for to be abeyed and out of
trouble / and that as long as his cosyn king Ponthus lives there shall no
man be so hyrdy for to meue war against them.

How Polydes king Ponthus cosyn wedded Genneuer the kings daughter of
England.


ANd when the king saw that they were consented he said to the king of
scotts and the Earl of Rychemonde the which were worshyppefull knights. Go
said he to the king and do him to wete of all this matter / and say him that
for his love we will have his cosyn. These two departed and called king
Ponthus a side and told him right gracyously how the king and the lords were
consented for the love and worship of him to the marriage that he had spoken of
to the Earl of Rychemonde. King Ponthus thanked the king and all his barons
right mekely and said yt they did him great worship / for the which god
grant hy^ grace to deserve it. And so long went and came the king of
scotts that he assembled them in the queen's chambred. And there came the
archebysshop of Cau^torbury the which fyaunced them It is not to ask if
Genneuer had great Joy in her heart all though she made tho simple for she
loved and praised him much the more for the good name that men gave him / and
also for the love of his cosyn the which that she loved so much before time.
And also Polydes thanked god hyghly in his heart that he had sent him so great
a worship in this world / and to have so fair a lady and of so goodly
behauynge. So the day of wedding was set ye eight day after. Great were
the feestes and great were the Iustes y^ which began the morrow after the day
of maryayge for king Ponthus would not accord that there should be done deeds
of arms the day of the marriage. And that he said for the king of bourgoyne ye
which dyed the day of his marriage. For to tell of the well Iusters it were to
long to tell / but over all king Ponthus Iusted best / for he was without
pere. Right well Iusted Polydes and the king of Ironde / and the lord de
lesygnen / and the lord de la toure / and the lord Mou^fort of brytayne /
these had the voyse of al well Iusters. It were to long to tell / so I pass
lightly / it were a great thing to tell of the great feast and of the great
ordynaunces of the seruyces of the vows and of the pryces that were given and
of all dysportes. The feast dured from the mondaye to the frydaye.

How king Ponthus departed from England.
AFter mete king Ponthus took his leave of ye king and of the queen / but with
great pain they gave him leave. Genneuer conveyed him well a two mile / and
they had much goodly talking together and she said unto him that she loved her
lord Ponthus much the more because she had loved him covertly / and that she
praised him the more that he had kept truly his first love. King Ponthus
smyled and said that there was no wyle but that women knew and thought. So
they spoke enough of diverse things and than he made her to turn again with
great pain and said unto her. My lady and my love I am your knight and shall
be as long as I live / so ye may command me what it pleases you / and I
shall fulfill it to my power / and than he said before Polydes my fair lady and
my love I will that my cosyn here love you and obey you / and that he have no
pleasaunce to none so much as unto you / and if there be any defaute do it me
to wete and I shall correct him. Sir said she he shall do as a good man ought
to do. God grant it said he. So he took his leave and departed. The king of
scotts and the king of Irlonde and the king of cornewayle they would have
conveyed him unto the port / but he would not suffer them. There was great
heaviness and courtesye between them at their departing / and after they took
their leave of him and returned again to the kings house. And king Ponthus
came to the port and called to him his cosyn Polydes aside and said unto him /
thanked be god ye ought great guerdon to god / for ye are in the way for to be
a right great king and a mighty of arms and of haueour and of noble
lordshyppes / so ye ought for to thank god hyghly. And therefore it behooves
you for to have four things if that ye will rejoice in peace and peasybly.

THe first is that ye be a very true man / that is to wete love god with all
your heart and dread to dysobey him if ye love him he shall help and sustain
you in all your needs / love and worship holy church and all the
commandments / this is the first service that men should yield to god. The
second is this that ye should bear worship and service unto them that ye be
comen of / and to them of whom ye have and may have richesse and worship /
that is to say love and serve ye fader of your wife / whereof much worship and
service to them that ye be comen of / be to him a very right sone keep you that
ye anger him not / suffer and endure what langage or words that shall be said
unto you / or of what tales that shall be reported to you / some for to pleale
you / and some by flatery or else for malice covert of such men as would not
the peace between you and him / for fair cosyn he that well suffers of his
better and of his greter he ouercomoth him. It is a great grace of god and of
ye world toward himself to have suffraunce for diverse reasons the which
should be unto long to tell. The third reason is for to be meke / gentle
amyable / large and free / after your power to your barons and to your knights
and squyers of whom that ye shall and may have need / and if ye may not show
them fredome and largess of your good at the leest be to them courteys and
debonayre both to great and to little / for both be good / the great shall
love you and the little shall praise you over all of your good chere and so he
shall auayll you a right heralde so much ye shall be praised over all. And
also it is to understand that ye shall be so more to your wife than to any
other for diverse reasons / for by worship and courteys berynge to her ye shall
hold the love of her bound unto you and for to be diverse and rude to her she
might happily change / and ye love whereof ye should rejoice she might give it to
another / where as me might take such a pleasaunce whereof that ye should be
right sorry / and that should ye not withdraw when ye would. So is there great
peril and great maystry to keep the love of marriage / and also beware that ye
keep your felfe true unto her as it is said in the gospel that ye should
change her for none other / and if ye do thus as I say you god shall
increase you in all wealth and in worship / if ye se her angry appease her
again by fayrenes / and wha^ she comes again to herself she shall love you
much the more / for there is no courtesye but that is yolde / and when an
heart is fell and angry and men wrath it more it ymagyneth things whereof many
harms may be fall. The fourth reason is that ye should be pyteous of the poor
the which that shall require right of the rich or of ye mighty that would
grieve them / for thereto be ye set and ordained / and all tho that have great
lordshyppes / for ye came in to the world as poor as they did / and as poor
shall ye be the day of your death and ye shall have no more of all earth save
only your length as the poor people shall have / and ye shall be bylefte in
the earth allone without any felawshyp as the poor people shall be / and
therefore shall ye have no lordshyp but for to hold right wysynesse without
blemysshynge or doubt of any master or represe / neither for love nor for
hate / for thus god commands her every friday in especyall the clamor of
the poor people and of women wydowes / put not their good right in respyte nor
in delacion / nor believe not always your officers of every thing that they
shall tell you. Enquere before the troth / for some of them will do it for to
purchase damage unto the simple people for hate / and some for couetyse to have
their good when they se they may not do with him what they will / so they came
with false reports. It is a peryllous thing of a great lord to be light of
believe. What shall I tell you / he taught and showed hy^ many examples. And tho
Polydes thanked him and said unto him. Sir I know well that ye love me and of
your goodness ye have purchased me the welfare and the worship that I have and
therefore I pray you that every year we may mete and se us together / for that
shall be my comfort and all my sustynaunce. I grant it said king Ponthus.
And after when they had spoken and talked of many things they took their leave
each of them of other and halsed and kyssed together / and none of them had
power to speak one word that one to that other / for meruaylously they loved
well together. And when that king Ponthus had his heart somewhat clered yt he
might speak / he took his leave of the lords of England and offered himself
much unto them. And Polydes turned again to the kings house where as men
made him right great Joy. Polydes withhelde well the good doctrine of his
cosyn for he served and obeyed the king and the queen / and made himself to
be byloued both of the great and of the little by his largess and by his
courtesye. Right well he loved god and holy church and was pyteous and
charytable unto the poor people The king and the queen loved him as their
own child / and about a seven year after ye king dyed / and tha^ was
Polydes crowned king of England peasybly And right good love was between them
and his wife and the old queen / and so he reigned in good peace and great
Joy. So here I leave to speak of Polydes and return again unto king Ponthus.

How the king Ponthus arrived in Brytayne.
HEre does king Ponthus sail so long on the sea till he and his barons were
londed in brytayne And than they went unto the kings house where as they were
received with great Joy of all manner of people. And when they had soiourned
well a seven days Geffrey de lesygnen / and Androwe de la toure / and the
strangers took their leave and departed. And king Ponthus gave them many great
gifts / and rich presents and thanked them and whelde them as his fellows
and his friends / and than he conveyed them a two mile whether they would or
not / and there they took their leave each of them of other. The king of
brytayne ne lived but about a three year after / for he was right aged. And
than was king Ponthus crowned king of Brytayne / and was right well byloued
of the nobles and of all manner of people / he was right good and right full of
Justice charytable and pyteuous on the poor. Right well they loved together he
and the queen his wife and led a right good and an holy life and did many
alms deeds. And when the household remeued fro one place to another / he
did cry that all they that he ought any good unto / were it for his household
or for any other thing yt were taken for him / that they should come to him or
to his officers / and all he did pay / for he said that they were foles that
abide to their heirs or to their executours / for few were contented / and
also they that held the good from the poor people should have thereof full
little merit. He used and led a right good and an holy life. So than they
went and dwelled a year in Galyce where as they were well byloued / dredde and
doubted and worshypped. The earl of desture thanked much the king his neuewe
for the great worship that he had done to his sone. The king gave great lands
and herytages to sir Patrycke that had saved him in the ship / and he that
had done so much good to the country. Right great reverence and worship bear
queen Sydoyne unto the old queen her lords mother. The king sent for his
uncle ye king of Aragoon and for lords and barons of the countrees about /
and made great Iustes that dured well a ten days.

How Ponthus and Sydoyne came to saint James.
ANd after they all and the queen went on pilgrimage to saint James in galyce
And after his ertournynge again they dwelled not long that they went to
wars in to spain against ye sarasyns and he led with him the barons of
Brytayne / of anioy of main / of poytow / of tourayne / and of Normandye. Of
the normans he led the earl of mortayne / the vycounte of auerenches. Tesson
/ paynel / and many other knights. Of main hongres de beaumount / and Guy de
la vale / and diverse other of anioy. Pyers de done. Androwe de la toure.
Guyllam de roches / the lord of Nermount. Johan de poytow / the lord de
lesygnen. Guy touars. leoncel de manleon / hongres de partenei Of Tourayne
Hubert de mayllye. Hondes de Bassye patrycke damboyse / and many of them of
brytayne / and of goscoyne / they were well a.xv.M. and dyscomfyted ye hethen
folk / and there did many great deeds of arms and took many towns and
castelles / and than in the winter every man went home in to his country / and
every man gave great loos and price to king Ponthus. For he paid them well of
their wages and gave them gretes gifts / in so much that they said there was
no right chyefteyne but he / and yt he was lykely to conquer all manner of
countrees by his knyghthode largenes and courtesy / for all manner of good
co^dycyons ben in him after the rule of god and the world / and in hy^ is all
goodlynes / for he owes great guerdon to god. He dwelled a little while after
in galyce / and than came again in to brytayne / and than he went and saw
his cosyn which was crowned king of England where as he was received with
great Joy. It is not to ask if the queen Genneuer set great pain to feast
him / and make him great chere. After that went the king of England in to
Gascoyne and in to galyce to se his fader and his kynnesmen / and gave them
great gifts. And than he turned again in to Brytayne where as he was much
made of and had great chere. And after that he went again in to his own
realm. King Ponthus and ye queen reigned long ynoughe^ And lived to the
pleasure of god. And than they dycessed and fynysshed to ye great heaviness and
sorrow of their people. But thus it is of the worldly life for there is none so
fair nor so rich so strong nor so goodly but at the last he must needs
leave this world.

Deo gratias.
