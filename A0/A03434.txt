IMPRINTED at London, in Fleetestreate, beneath the Conduite, at the Sign of
S. John Evangelist, by Hugh Iackson.

To the right Worshipful, Master Henry Vernon of Stoke, in the Countye of
Salop, and Master John Vernon of Sudbury, in the Countye of Darby, Esquyers.
T. N. wishe^h long life, continual health, and prospe^ous felicity, etc.
BEing already by true trial in others sufficiently taught, and by mutual
conference in my self thoroughly persuaded of the synguler curtesy, and
favorable lenity lodging within you, I was the bolder (Right Worshipful) at
this present, to prefix your names in the forehead of this little book, in
token of that entire good will, which (by an inviolable vow) I bear to your
persons, in respect of your rare virtues, and the great desire I have to
gratifye your surpassing curtesyes, if my ability might stretch any way, to
counterpoyse the weight of my inward affection. And for as much as Nature has
linked you together so straightly and firmly, with the infringible chain of
Consanguinitie, kindred, and agreement of manners: I demed it an offense equal
almost with sacrilege, for so small a matter as this, to separate and disseuer
you. Beseeching your Worships to make no other co^struction, or interpretation
of my meaning, then my simplicity pretends, and by your friendlye
acceptaunce hereof, to countenance the travail of him, who is not now to
answer for himself: which request I make the more earnestly for him, for
that in such a case, a man may with more face of honesty, sue and entreat for
his friend, then for himself. Of which your accustomed favors, as I nothing
stand in doubt: So do I heartilye beeseeche God, to prosper, protect, and
direct you in all your rightful attemptes, and Godly enterpryses, and after
many years here Worshipfully spent, to make you ^oheyres with his Son Christ,
in his glorious Hierarchy.

At Butley this.xxx. of October. 1577. Yours most bounden. T. N.

T. N. to the courteous, friendlye, and indifferent Reader.
AS the Books be many, and the deuyses sundry, which now a days in great
swarms are sent abroad, and publyshed: so likewise, pregnaunt are the wits,
and ripe are the judgments of a great number, which busyly bestow their
trauayles, and learnedly lend the practyses of their pens to display,
discipher, and offer out to the gazing view of the world, y^ store of their
cunning, and the gallauntnesse of their inventions: Some tend to good, and
Godly purposes: some to vain and tryfeling fantasyes: some conduce to the
advancement of virtue and commendation of the well deserving: some to the
suppressing, debelling, beating down, and subduing of vice, with a detestation
of the loathsome life of the wicked, and the ruynous end of their pestiferous
dealinges. And Tome (she more pittye) serve altogether to noorish wantonness,
and maintain lascivious lusts. But howsoever they deal herein, well I wot,
that they either do, or else ought, and should every one according to his
ability, to further and promote virtue, and by all conuenyent means to rehate
lose life, and to bring vice into contempt among all men: the very practice
whereof, brings detestation, and the end whereof bredeth confusyon. And
because no way seems so ready to exhort, anymate, advise, and encourage to
well doing, neither any course so direct to dehort, terrifye, abash, and
discorage from evil doing, and especially them of the younger sort (wherein is
most danger, and who yet stand tottering and balauncing in the scales of
aduysement, uncertain which way to wend, or what path to trace) from the
ordinary pursuit of their wilful affections and inordinate appetites, then by
the Examples of others, that have trodden the way before, whose success they
may apply to their own direction: therefore have many good Aucthours, both old
and new, peculyarlye entitled their works by the name and title of Examples,
Methodically couched in plain Historyes: wherein be lively patterns set down
and expressed, testifying what gaynes is gained by voluptuous life, and what
guerdon ensues sensual appetite: wherein as in a Table, is forcibly
delineated, how some for virtue, have risen to honor, fame, dignity, and
renown, and some for vice have been thrown down, and buried in the pit of
dishonor, shame, reproach, and eternal infamy. So that the worthy advancement
of the one, may be a sharp spur to stir up to goodness, and the loathsome
beastlynesse of the other, a bridle to reine our appetytes from these
inconveniences, wherein we see them to have been for their demerytes, condignly
plunged, to y^ open overthrows of their present estates, and obloquious stayn
to all their posterity. For certaynelye the view and consideration of the
accidents that have driven others (for notoryous enormyties committed, and
lose life lewdely lead,) upon the rufull rocks, and sandy shelues of lamentale
loss, and doleful decay, is in my opinion a good document for us to beware of
semblable folly, and to keep our selves within the prescripte bounds of
modest behauyour. To this end Hystoryes and Pamphlets, as well of the good
success of well doers, as of the ill happes of the wicked, do generally tend^
and purposely serve, and are alyke expedient, so that they be simply
interpreted, and rightly applied. In the number of which well meaning writers,
I dare to enrole the writer, and translator of these present Hystoryes, and
Tragical troubles, out of French, into this our English tongue, meaning not
hereby to open any more wyndowes, to unstayed youth, whereby to egg them to
spend their golden time, in perusing peevish, paltring, and poisonous
Pamphlets, and so to corrupt their unsettled dispositions, but by modeste and
seasonable aduertisementes, to reclayme their fond fyckle fantasyes, and to
quallifye their intemperate and headye humors. For the bringing of which
matter to better pass, the penner hereof, thought himself to have taken a good
and direct course, by enterlacing pleasure with profit, and by reducing the
ground of his conceived meaning, into a meet Method of Historycal occurrence.
And for that it is none of the least part of mercy, to father the Fatherless,
and protect the pore Orphane, from the greedy jaws of ravenous rakers, I have
here restored to him his due, and set forth his travail even as he left it,
without any injury either to his person, or any jot gelding his honest and
painful endeavors: for I accoumpt it no good dealing, that any man should
thrust his lies into an others Harvest, or like Esopes Crow to usurp and
iette abroad, deckte with the Feathers of other bewtifuller Byrds: or to have
such a tyckling ytche, or rather scabbe of vaynegloryous fame, to arrogate that
to himself, which an other man's toil has enterprysed and brought to pass.
Beseeching thee gentle Reader to accept well in worth this pretty Pamplet, little
(I confess) in bulk, but fraught with such matter, as may, if thou will, yield
thee good and wholesome instruction: which as it now perchance lacks not
here and there his imperfections, so (had God lent to the Author longer life)
would have been better poolyshed, and as void of faults and escapes in the
prynting, as his mind was free from justly giving occasion of offense to any.
Which courtesye, if (accordingly) there appear to remain within thee, then
(doubtless) is his pains fully rewarded, and my expectation suffycyentlye
satysfyed.

Farewell.
CERTAIN STRANGE and Lamentable Tragical Historyes.
A just Fact, but to cruel, of John Maria, Duke of Myllayne, toward a Priest
extreme covetous.
John Maria Vicont, son of John Galeas, unto whom the Emperor Ladisilaus
gave the title and name of Duke of Myllayne, was he that succeeding in the
estate and dignity of Duke, made himself known and renowned, before all the
Princes of his time: not in showing himself more virtuous then they, or in
surpassing the good Fortune of that good Galeas his Father, who I think never
committed any other notable evil, then that he left behind him a plague so
great and dangerous as his son, the succession of whom, was no more
fortunate for the Milinois, then was once the Romayne Monarch of Marcus
Aurelius, leaving for the inheritour of the Empire, that Butcher* and Sword
player Commodus, a lyuelye example of creweltye and mischief, and truly his
Country might well have coniectured their Misfortune, in that John Maria was
called to the Dignitye of the Dukedom, after that all Italye had seen the
Orygynall of the Civil wars so often written of by the Hystoryans, which so
much weakened the strength of Italye, and abased the glory of those things
which remained to them, as Relics escaped from the hands of so many
Barbaryans and Strangers, that had foiled with their fe^te, the honor of
that Godly Prouynce, for it was after that the Guelfes and Gibilines had
throughlye divided themselves, leauyng no corner of Italye, that was notte Dyed
with the blood of the poor Citizens, and was it not pittyfull, to see the
Nobillitye chased and wandering abroad, there being no creature that felt not
this Tempeste, and which perceived not the vehemencye of a deuysyon so
furyo^s, so that all Natyons of Europe, had their access to make their Rodes
into Italye, and there to pyll the Cittyes, and Fertyle Fyeldes, called into
the country, either by the one or the other of the Factions.

But this Duke was renowned for the most cruel and inhumayne Tyraunte, that
ever was nouryshed in Christendom, and I believe that Bucyrus Phalaris, or
that Thracian King which fostred his Horses with the bodies of the dead, did
never surpass him in crueltye, and although his Predicessoures had been
Princes, very merciful, and gentle, and that by their modestye, they had
attained to the place of such Prehemynence, yet this is he which forgetting
the house whereof he came, did degenerate from the blood of his Ancestors,
being despightfull, for that Fortune had been otherwise to him, then she had
been toward that excellent John Galeas his Father, and to Valentyne that was
Wife to the Duke of Orleans, she which was slain at Paris, by the Duke of
Burgoyne his men, does so accarnate himself, that he caused to be devoured
in his presence, by Mastyfes brought up to that end, those which for the
least occasyon that he fantasyed in his mind, did displease him, having
for the Mynyster of his crueltye, and in stead of Prouest Marshall, a
Gentleman named, Squarce Gyrame, as courteous as his Lord, and who in the end
was also paid with the same paymente, as was his Master, being both together
as cruelly slain, as vnpittifull they had fleshed themselves upon the
miserable people of Millayne, during the time then that this incorporate Devil
reioyseth himself, and shows these tragical and detestable acts of his
cruel life, this thing chanced which I am now about to descrybe unto you, to
the end you may behold the two great and extreme vices, the one of Auaryce
in a Priest, and the other of the cruelty, of the Duke. John Maria ryding one
day thorough his Cittye, as commonly he did, not only for to behold the
faults of his subjects, but more to search out if any one durst complayn of
the detestable manners of his life, and the very hauty and tyrannical doings of
his raygn, to the end he might seem to have some reason to torment him, that
should complain without cause of his Lord, that as yet had given him no
occasyon: Thus as he made these Journeys, he hard a far of, a great cry, and
the voice of a woman complaining, who clapping her hands, did eleuate her voice
very high, thinking that GOD was deaf, and that he will not hear our
necessityes, without such a stir, to whom he sent one of his servant, to
know the cause of a cry so fearful, who found it at thedore of a pore woman,
whose husband was lately deceased, that thus complained, as well for the loss
of her companyon, as also for that she had not wherewith to bring him to the
earth. Alas, says the woman (half desperate) whether may the pore have their
recourse? sith the very Church has denyde their duetyes to them, unto whom
they be bound, to whom may I adresse my self? not having wherewith to
satisfye, or glent the desire of my insatiable Curat, that is neither content
with the gayns which he has, suffering this body without life, to remain
without Sepulture, only for the heritage of all the goods which he has left
me in this world for my comfort, for if I will have him interred, of
necessitye I must sell all my moueables, and afterward not knowing how to
relieve my Infantes. Ah false Pastor, I beseech God to punish with some great
persecution, both thee and them which are of like conditions, saying so, with
cries, tears, sobs, and sighs, she pardons not her own cheeks and face,
but scratcheth the one, she bepaynteth the others, stryking herself upon the
stomach, and showing diverse other signs of a woman distraught, the Dukes man
seeing her to show such fashyons, addressed him toward her, saying: My friend,
what wrong is this that is done to you, and wherefore show you so great dule?
tell me, because I may make the report to my Lord, who has sent me hither to
know the matter, and assure your self, if any one has offended you, he will
extend such Justice, that you shall be content and satisfied, and the
authoures shall have whereof to take example, and withholden to do iniurye to
the poor in such a Town as this, where the Lord will that Justice be done
to every one, without respect of estate.

The woman who knew by his Lyuerye, that he was one of the Dukes Servants,
whose presence although it were not very agreeable unto her, in thynking that
he came there but only to seek some pray, yet not fearing any worse
adventure then her own, nor any Fortune more froward then the estate wherein
she was, and also for that death to her would have been great solace, ioying
also that the Offycer had talked unto her so gentlye, answers him in this
sort.

Alas Sir, behold there the dead body of my Husband, which the Priest of
this Parrishe has refused to burye, for that I have not wherewith to satisfye
him for his pain, and to content him for the Funerals. This is the occasyon
why I torment my self, not knowing how I may interre the dead Corpse, the
only memory whereof, has made me so full of sorrow and dule, and to show
before your eyes this outrage. The Duke which this space attended to know the
occasyon of this cry, unto whom his man being returned, says: My Lord, in
this house before you, is a poor woman, inuyroned with small Children, (whose
Husband this morning being dead), has desired the Priest to burye the body
of the dead, but he unless she will pay the interrage, and the accustomed
Funeralles, has utterly denied her to go about it, wherefore she makes
this noise, not having wherewith to do it, and furthermore, if she should
sell her mooueables, she has not wherewyth then to bring up her small
Infantes.

John Maria hearing him tell of a Fact so Vylonyous, and of a covetousness so
detestable, began to laugh, whose laughter was a prognostication of the tears
of some man. Then tourning to them of his Train, he says.

Truly this master Curate is very uncharitable, and greatly given to his own
profit, so to deny his help to them that require him, sith that it is his
duty, and he is hired to do it. Therefore it is good that I show him the
way, and excercyse our Charity in this, causing this body to be intombed, and
then to extend our alms to this woman, that lamenteth as well for her own
loss, as for that she beholds her self charged with Infantes, and not
knowing how to keep them, should not this be well done? says he to his
Gentlemen: Truly my Lord answers one of the train, this act would be as
greatly praised, as any good deed that you can do in this world, and
especially for that your excellencye in forgetting your Nobillity, shall so
much abase your self, as to accompany the most pore to the earth, and to
succor their widows, although they never did you any service: Let us go
then (says the Duke,) the Priest as it may be, will do his duetye to this
party, at my desire, wherefore I will give him such a Salary for his pains,
as all his life after, he shall not have cause to complain: He says this,
thinking so well to chasten the Priest, that from thence forth he should make
no more such refusals, commanding then, that he which had been first at the
house of the widdowe, should go for the Curate to come talk with the Duke, for
a matter of great importance. The master Chaplen which thought of nothing
less, then the fault which he had done, and remembered not at all of the dead,
the corpse of whom, remained without Sepulture, came suddenly to the Dukes
presence, whom after the Duke had well beholden, and seeing him fat, gross in
every point, and clothed in rich Apparel, was not abashed at all of the
refusal that he had made to the pore woman, as well for his well lyking,
whereby he showed that one hour of pleasure, was an hundred times more
agreeable unto him, then a thousand years of servitude, and that also to nourish
such a belly, it was needful to have more gaynes, then rose of his cure,
having his Vysage more like the picture of some swollen Bacchus, then of one
professing the study of divinity, finally this Priest did not vary at all
from the most part of them, that at this day to the great damage of all
Christendom, have entered into the Ministry, who think that they have done
their duty, in making a feast or dinner to their equalles, without remembering
the rest of their office, neither to visyte the poor, nor to succor them,
according to the statutes, and ordinances of the holy Canons, ordained by the
general and sacred counsels, but are become feeders of their own bellyes, and
dumme dogs, so that the only name of Priesthood ought to shadow them, and
suffyce as they imagyne, without necessity to put their hand to the work, and
to satisfye by effect, that for which they be called. Our Curate then bold and
assured, presents himself to John Maria, saying: My Lord, it has pleased
your excellency to command me to come before you, may it also please you to
show me the thing wherein you will employ me, in which I will obey you, as he
that desires nothing but to serve and please you. The wyly and subtle Lord,
seeing the feigned curtesy and pleasant words of the sir John, began to laugh,
and to mock him with his glory, and to detest his impudent auaryce, answering
him: I have sent for you to the end you should cause to be brought to the
earth, that poor man which is one of your parishioners, and I will give you
the reward and Salary that you merit, for it is neither just nor meet that
such a man as you, should be employed without recompense. Pardone me my Lord
says the Priest, your only commandment death suffyce, and your grace holds
the place of al satysfaction: Well, well, says the Duke, I accept all that you
have said, and believe that you would do more for me then this, sith at this
time I see you so priest to do your duty in this afayre, therefore go
prepare your self, for I will assist you at the obsequies, assuring you, that
you shall be recompensed before I depart, as I intend, and according to your
desartes.

Now the Chaplayne, which thought that he was already placed in the office of
the Dukes Almoner, very pleasant and merrye departs toward his Church,
where he sets all things in order, and sends for a good company of
Priests and others, which served ordinarilye in the Churches, because he
would with more greater pomp, and honor accompany the Corpse, for which the
Duke had so desired him.

But the miserable Priest saw not, that was the Train which Fortune had
ordained for him, and how near the hour did approache, in which he must pay
the arr^rages of his before passed life, and above all that great and vile sin
of cruel Auaryce, by an other crueltye the most strange that has been
heard of, and I am abashed, how he should be so far beside his wit, that
seeing the fault which he had committed, and knowing the nature of his Lord,
himself hearing him speak so doubtfully, and with words smelling more of his
choler then gentleness, how he durst return and represent himself again
before the furyous face of his Prince: But what? he was so blinded with
Auaryce, and led withthe desire of Money, that every look seemed unto him
courteous, and every word pleasant, sith the talk of gain and recompense
marched therewyth. A cruel custom of the Duke of Millayne.
The unhappy Priest had ^orgotten that the Duke for the least occasyon that
might be, caused to be dysmembered with his Dogs, men women, and children,
without having regard either to Sex or Age, so unnatural and cruel wear
his condycyons. What? ought he to hope of more gentleness and humanity,
then an infynite number of the Citizens of Millayn, the death of whom served
for a pastyme to the rage of this cruel Duke. What thought he to find him more
religyous toward him? then just to them whose innocencye had made them
unworthy of all punishment. Alas, although he had rendered Boloigna the great
unto the Pope, and that he had humbled himself to the Apostolical seat very
mekely, yet this was more for fear and imbecillitie, then for the affection
that he had to religyon, for it is impossible that such a Barbarous and cruel
Tyrant, should either honor or reverence God, or that he should acknowledge
any thing that touches the respect of Religion, witness of this was once
that Tyrant Denis of Sciscill, after that he mocked and rejoiced at the
sacrilege and crueltye, making no conscience to pill and rob the Temples, for
these contemners feign all gentleness and dissemble to have their minds full of
all devotion and holiness: But you see by effect to what end tends their
symplicity, and it is the honor and fear of God that pricketh and moves
them to some reverence, leaving this discourse, we will return again to our
Priest, who caused to be carried the most fair and rich Cross of his Church,
prouyding Clarks to carry the Corpse, and using such diligence, as if he had
been the most rich Usurer of all the banquers of Lombardy, and not forgetting
to cover him with the most rych covering of his Church.

The Duke hearing the iangling and noise of the Belles, could not refrain from
laughter, saying: By God Master Curat you show well the greedy appetyte of you
auaryce, sith the dead carcases do so displease you without offense, I will
give you such a reward as shall remain in memory here this hundred years: His
men by these words perceived well that the Duke had devised somewhat against
the Curat, and assured themselves seeing his countenance, which the Priest
feared as much as death: But behold now the Chaplayne with his company, came
and sung the Ambrosyan Vygils, before the door of the dead, to whom the Duke
was assistaunte, and heard with pacyence and good deuotyon, the Durge sung for
the dead, which he beheld gladly then, for one that accompanied him, during
this stir he gave commandment to the grave makers, that they should make
the grave very deep and large, without telling why so, of whom he was
obayed, for that they knew the commander, who was well known in his Dukedom,
more for fear, then love that any of his Subjects bare him, for that is very
true which is commonly said, that men hate him deadly, whom they fear, the
service being ended in the Church, there was great Funeral pomp showed in
going to the Churchyard, to fynish the Obsequyes, that yet before the body
was put into the earth, they song Psalms, and other Prayers, in such a case
accustomed, where the Priest observed such a grauytye and reverence in his
Ceremonies, that he himself could scarce forbear the pleasure that he
received of his well doing. But behold here the last act of the Tragedye, for
as soon as all was fynished, Hor^^ble wa^^ ^ease upon dead bodies.
and that the Priest had cast holy water upon the dead body, leauyng the
office to put him into the earth, to them that had the charge thereof, which
began straight ways to fulfill the last Ceremonye of the buryall, then the
Duke calls unto them, saying: That they must attend, for as yet all the
Ceremonies of the Funeral were not perfyte, for he would honor the dead
with some thing otherwise, then they thought of, all men were astonyed at this
new act of the Duke, and moreover because he addresseth him toward the
Priest, with his face inslamed with choler, and a voice representing his fury,
saying: Chaplayn, if thy Avarice did not render thee more infamous then the
rest of thy hypocritical life, does give the good renown, I should have some
occasyon to dissemble thy faul^e, if thou did use it only to them, that have
wherewyth to satisfye thy appetyte, and sustain their own household: But sith
I perceive with mine eyes that thou art but a raueuing Wolf, which desyrest
the spoil of thy Flock^, I will pay thee presentlye according to the merytes
of thy charity, which being spoken, he tourneth him toward them that
would have put the Corse into the Grave, to whom he uses these, or like
words: For as much as this Priest being alive, would not accompanye the
dead to the Grave, I will that quycke and dead he shall hold him company unto
the day of the great Ressurection, therefore take and bind him with the Corse,
and put them both in tog^the^s, to the end that the presence of the priest,
being in this apparel that he is, may make them welcome among the Devils, when
they must pass by the chambers of hell, all the world as I have said, were so
astonyed of the beastly manners and great crueltye of the Duke, that the grave
makers obeying his commandme^t, took the Priest and bound him straightlye
face to face, and mouth against mouth, with the carcass of the dead, a cruelty
truly extreme great and detestable, although that the vice of the Churchman
was worthy of punishmente, but not after this fashyon, nor with death, as he
punished his offense, what should one expecte at his hand^ that remembers no
other Justice, then that he fantasyeth in wicked and tyrannical mind, and
what reason should one look for of him, that detesteth all law, and remembereth
no goodness at all, having no law, but his own will, nor other mercy then that
which ends with cruel Butchery, having no less pleasure then Caligula had
to see slaughter, ruin, and effusyon of blood: When the rest of the Clergy
saw him entreat the priest of this sort, fearing that the fury of the Duke
would pursue all the company in like order, they threw down the Cross, the
Sprinckle, and holy water Tankarde, and left the Tapers, to take their feet,
and save them from the rage of the Tyraunte, who seeing them run out of the
Churchyard so afearde, and without order, could not hold himself from laughter,
although on the other side, he heard the dolorous voice of the miserable
Chapleyn, that they were about to put quick into the earth. Alas my Lord
(says he) have compassyon on me unhappy wight, that so humblye require you
of pardon for my fault, and which promise never to offend you more, and to
recompense the widdowe for the small pity I showed unto her. What art thou
no more bold (says John Maria, being so vnpittifull) that thou art afearde
of the shadows of them that floate on the River of Death, and forgetfulness,
take thou no care for the Wyddow, I have already better provided for her, then
thou haste for thy affairs. Therefore calls he to the others, that they
should dispatch, that the good Synger should not trouble him any more with his
prayers, the^ all at once they began to lay down the two bodies, to cover
them with earth, when as the Priest cried. Alas my Lord, if you have no pity
of the body, yet have compassyon of the salvation of the soul, as much as is
in your power, and suffer me not to dye, without confessing my faults, before
some Minister of God, according to the institution of the church. Go, go, says
the Duke, thou had more need to appease the Porter of Hell with thy
Orations, since thou can not get a Priest at this present, they be all fled
away from thee, seeing thee already converted into a nightspright, to afray
Children in the Churchyard, and therefore thou shalt be put into the earth,
with the absolucyon that thou haste, give him whom thou imbracest, that may
serve for the alegeance of the heap of all thy offenses. With such railing,
the inhumayn Prince caused the two bodies to be cast into the pit, with no
less abashment of al men, then as a thing that they had never seen done
before, which thought not that the Duke so unadvisedly, and of such a beastly
manner would have put men to death, but his life was no less detestable, then
the life of the Emperor Macryne, who used like manners, and punished more
cruelly then he did, sith the Priest was pressed and choked, as well by the
smell of the dead body, as by the earth that was cast upon him, the grave
being very deep, whereas the Emperor without pyttye, caused such as he had
condemned, to be bound likewise to the dead carcases that putrifyed the
Air, not suffering them to be buried, but let them so remain till that either
by faintness, or stinche of the dead body, and the multitude of Vermyn, they
cruelly departed out of this life. Nor more courteous was Maximiniam, who caused
such as he hated to be thrust into the empty belly of an Ox, unto the head,
where they ended their misery by y^ blood that ran out of the beast, but the
barbarous time, does excuse these Galla^ts that being Panims, and without
knowledge of God, which are not so much to be maruailed at, if they did their
works acording to the desire of the devil that was their guide, who is a
murderer from the beginning, but a christyan Prince come of a good stock,
brought up amongst men of learning, and dwelling in so civil a Country
ought to make the case more strange, sith that the earth once cried vengeance
to GOD upon Cayne, for that he had vyolated the Bright of kynred, in sleaing
that just Abell his Brother, I believe that within a little time after, John
Maria for so pernicious a crime, was slain by his own Citizens, and I think
that in our time there be some that have made sacryfyce of heads, and other
members, and who like Diomedes have caused their Horses to eat the bodies of
men. But I believe that God will not leave such crueltyes unpunished, although
for a while he attends and is pacyent in his doings, yet in the end he will
cause the^ to feel the strength of his arm, and to feel the inuytable ire of
his just displeasure.

Now to return to the matter, the Duke having accomplyshed these Tragical,
and sorrowful Funerals, he dispatched suddenly one of his men to the house of
the Priest, from whence he caused all his moueables to be carried, and given to
the poor wyddow, the wife of him that was dead, with whom the Priest was
companyon in the grave. This last sentence was as just, as the first was
unjust, cruel, and horrible, sith it was good reason that he should be
punished in his goods, that for A^aryce and desire of Money, had forgotten
himself, and the duty requysyte in a public man, such a one as is the
Pastoure of a Church, be not offended, (you that bear the Ecclesyasticall
Offices) of that which I have said, but take Example by the miserable end of
one of your estate, thinking that the persecutions and the evil that God has
sent you, proceeds of your ambicion, auaryce, ignorance, and whoredom, I tell
you truly, I am sorry for that the aduersarye of the Church suppresseth the
good men, and throws down them that ought to be honored, whereas the foolish,
the slow bellyes, the ignorant, and the whoremo^gers feel no such scourges,
but God which is just, has by these means called you to repentance, because
you should acknowledge your faults, and live more Godly then the Abbot
Guensaldo, The Hystory of whom is already set forth excellently by Master
Fenton.
and this miserable Myser, entreated so cruelly by the most detestable tyrant
that ever was seen in Italy, since the Lombardes gave the name to that Land.

FINIS.
A Gentleman Myllinois being amorous at the very end of his age, for the
extreme Ielosy of his Concubyne, was cause of the death of his Son and of
himself, and lastly of the unhappy end of the Harlot, which was cause of all.
AT the time when the french armies were discovered throughout Italy, for the
Conquest of Myllayne, causing all the state of the Venetians to tremble* when
Lewis the seventh had brought his affairs in such readynes, that he pitched
his Camp even in the sight of their next City, breaking down their walls,
and overthrowing with the force of his Canons their Towers of defense, that
Venis never felt any greater, or more mightyer force.

The Venetians not knowing how, or by what means to quiet their bonds, and
to appease the displeasure of a King, justly incensed against their
infydelitie and arrogancy, about that time (I say) there was a Gentleman
Milinois, which for the troubles coming, does convey himself to a Castle,
that he had before Monse, as likewise did the most part of them that could
not brook the changing of their Lord, or who (as it might be) were not able
to endure the insolencye, and crueltye of the French Souldyers.

This Gentleman of whom I entreat, was a Wyddower, to whom there was
remaining only two children, the one of the Age of seven or eyghte years, the
other approaching near to the age of twentye, the old man seeing himself
without a wife, although he had almost passed the age of threescore
years, neither having regard to his Age, nor to his approaching death, does
become amorous of a gyrle, the Daughter of a Messenger, both fair and well
favored, of whom he had his pleasure, by the means of the only Father of
the Gyrle, which sold her unto him.

This is a mark very certain, to bewail any man, which we see in his age to
become a Father, whose youth has given him no sign thereof, yet this is most
detestable that Chrystyans bear the iniquity of Fathers and Mothers, so
impudente and evil, as to sell, prostytute, and corrupt their own Daughters,
and commonly the Maiestrates of our time will see nothing, the Kings shut
their eyes, they that feign them selves to be most holy of all the rest, take
some Golden gift to hear the Chastitye soulde ^or bargayned sommes, and there
is not one amongst them all, which punishes this marchandyse of bodies,
washed by the blood of him, that through the price of his life has redeemed us
out of the hands of him, which held us in bondage, wherefore the Gentiles
and Infydels of time paste, do exceed and vanquish us in Justice and
polliticke doings, more right then ours, that they have thereby attained the
glory of punishing faults which we behold, endure, and approve, and as
executers thereof, do glory and praise them. Unhappy surely is ye world, where
vice beres the name of Justice, and Iniquitye is praised as a virtue,
unfortunate is the place where such favor is showed to the wicked, that their
infamye is sustained, and approved by the most mighty. But the wicked do
not remember at all, that GOD is in Heaven, regarding and beholding the deeds
of men, for to do Justice one day, by the strength of his hand, and the
inuytable force of his scourges, by which (without exceptynge of persons) he
indyfferentlye does punish both the fault of the offender, and of him that
fails to execute the aucthoritye, and the sword that God has put into his
hands. But now to return to our former matter, this very lybydynous and
wanton old man, keeping this Gyrle at bed and boorde in his Castle, lying
ordinarily with her, and chafeth the cold and unhappy flesh of the vile
Mountayn Satyr, that seeks to continue that which nature does deny him, and
assayeth to overcome his own force. The eldest son seeing the dishonesty of
his father, was sad beyond all measure, using nevertheless such a modestye
and virtuous dissimulation, because he would not make sorrowful his father,
that he showed a better countenance to the Palyarde, then he could well,
whom he hated to the death, as well for that she was such a one, as for that
he knew she would be the ruin and shortning of the life of the unhappy old
man, and also for that he saw her so fond and unshamefast, that one might
easilye judge by her, she would not refuse the intertayning of another
Captain, which might furnish her somewhat better, for the old man does serve
only for the increasing and provocation of her sensuality, without power at
any time to content the immoderate wantonness, that burned within her mind,
and therefore she thinks to practyse a combat more lustye and of better hope,
which she did, because the old man was not able to suffice her: Ah insaciable
desires, and depth not to be filled, that is the wantonness of an harlot, what
detestable evils have chanced by these loves, to them that without all shame,
have put all their glory and pleasure in the delights and flatteryes of the
world, only Sampson, Solomon, and Hercules may give sure testimony. Now this
gyrle as we said before, feeling the dimissing of the forces of her lover, does
deliberate to pursue another pray, therefore she impudently casts her looks
on the son of the Gentleman, and in beco^ming Amorous, she purposes, if it
be possible, to make him the Liefetenaunt, and aid of his Father, and this she
does not for any curtesy that was hid under the Haggard and rustic nature,
and bringing up of the rude country, but for that she saw the young man fair,
well proporcyoned of his members, and for that she judges him apt to perform
the Chase, in which his father was able to give but simple attemptes, suddenly
she seaseth from her enterprise, as do the young Lovers, not expert or able
enough to detayne their pray, by and by again, she goes about to show him al
friendship, and familiarity that she could, and often times she seeks him,
fynding him at his book, where she shows evidently the desires that cause her
to pursue him. But the good child, never thought of such a wickedness, as well
to be chaste of his nature, as for the fear of God, and offending of his
father, and for that as yet, he had never been kyndled with love, nor taken in
the trap of worldly follyes: But the Concubyne perceiving that she trauayled
in vayn, thinking to make him understand her desires by signs, does
deliberate, (as soon as occasyon should be offered) to manifest it unto him
by word, which she did one day, his Father being gone to see one of his
neighbors, and before she would assault the young man, she does instruct
in that myschiefe a Chambermayd her Cosen, to the end that when her perswasyons
should fail, the other might supplye her want, as soon as these eloquente
Ieayes had prepared themselves, they went to seek the Gentleman, whom they
found recreatyng himself in the myddest of a great Chamber, the fair Forest
Nymphe, assysted with the keeper of her bed, began to say unto him. I know
not sir what to think of you, or to make of your doings, which loved and
desired of any, do not accoumpte it your part to recompense them with like
affections, which desire your acquayntaunce, I think surely that you are not
so cold, that your heart is not to be attached with any amorous passion, nor I
esteem you so froward that if any fair dame of what state soever she were,
would give you power to command, you would be able to abandon and refuse her.
To what purpose say you this? answers h^, have you seen in me any sign
of rudeness or discourtesye toward any woman that lives? I swear unto you
that if unwittingly I have committed this fault, for a fault requyres but
amends. She which thought to have holy gained, and to embrace him already
within her arms, began to weep very tenderly, in saying: Alas sir, I know
one yt would think her the most hapy woman that lives, if you would amend the
wrong which you have done her, in not making accoumpte of the signs by which
she has assayed to cause you to understand her grief. I know not a woman
under heaven, (says he) of whom I have had such acquayntaunce, to know any
sign that should show me her privy affection: And would you have her
despair of that (says she) which she sees also mistaken, you not willing to
see any thing in so plain a thing, and not to perceive at all whereunto
things are offered so openly to the senses of him that is so insensible, that
he can not comprehend the means and deuyses of the passyonate, and which
tastes not the vyands purposed to be discovered.

I understand not this talk (says he) if you express it not otherwise.

This is, then says the Chambermayd that my Cosyn is so amorous of you, that
if you have not pittye of her, she is in danger to end her life myserablye.
Amorous of me, says the chaste young man, is it possible that a daughter of
her age, should be so unshamefast and impudent, as to solocite the son, after
she has been deflowred by the father. Auaunte you strumpets, love such as you
be, and go exercise your tromperyes with the Devils, that may furbisse you
according to the heates that so molest you, you show well the place of your
birth, which was never otherwise then infamous and beastly, for who is so
foolish to think that an evil tree of it self can bring forth good or
delicious fruit* Think thou infamous creature, and vile Pallyarde, that I
will be so wicked, as so unshamefastly to vyolate the bed of my Lord and
Father, how unlawful and common soever she be? No, no, I have I thank God the
Heaven before mine eyes, toward the which when I address my sight, I behold
one God, which does vysyte the iniquities of the wicked, and pays to every
one according to his Justice and demerytes, I have regard to the reverence
that I owe to my father, for else long agone I would have sent thee toward
thy father, which was y^ Butcher, and the infamous Minister of thy chastity,
get thee away then from hence, and talk no more to me of this, else I assure
thee, I shall cause my Father to know it, to the end that he shall hold no
longer in his company, an infection so contagyous as thou, which art like to
be the overthrow and ruin of all his house: Having said so, the good young
man almost beside himself, and greatly abashed, departs out of the Chamber,
leaving the two Flatterers as much ashamed and abashed, as he was angry for
their impudent request. Now this wanton Concubyne loses not her stomach, but
day by day she importunately sueth unto him by her Cosyn: But he remains
fyrme in his opinion, and although he had no desire to report it to his
Father, yet he threatens them so well, that they feared he would do as he
said, and therefore they addressed such a treason, as you shall hear.

The detestable Palyarde beholding herself so often refused, begins by
little and little, to convert the love that she bare to this young Gentleman,
into a fury and deadly hate, and this enraged enemy increased, and took such
deep root in her heart, that she with the Chambermayde her Cosyn, does deuyse
the utter ruin of him, that had so folishly dispysed her, so they consulte
togythers, she should complain to the Father, that his son would with force
have vyolated, and taken his pleasure upon her, which being thus concluded
between these two abominable Furyes, was shortly executed. For a certain
time after, as soon as the old man was gone to see his lands, lying
thereaboutes, these unhappy women seeing him return, even then began to
change their vysage, not ceasing to weep, sygh, and lament, without any will
to depart out of the chamber. The unfortunate Gentleman aryued, came into the
Chamber of his Mynion, whom he found all be wept, accompanied with her
counselor, who for her part showed well that it was for some great matter
that they were so sorrowful. He which loved this evil woman more then
himself, wylling to know what this mente, prays her to comfort her self,
and imbraceth her so gentlely, that the false Crocodile, as constrained to do
so, began to weep more bitterlye then before, declaring a long Fable that
might serve to give some couloure to her accusation, in the end she says. O
would God my Lord that death had taken me away the hour before ye went
hence, for I would not by any means have been the occasyon of that evil which
I see prepared, in accoumpting to you the truth of that which you so much
desire to know, but what will it avail to dissemble that which in the end will
manifest it self? I am (unfortunate woman) the me^ke^y of every one, and
despised of all, for that I am the pleasure of your age, but is not this enough
if he do not assay to convert this simple sin into a vice incestious and
execrable? this is your eldest son, my Lord; that forgetting the honor which
he owes to your age, to the reverence whereof he is bound by the power which
you have over him, has oftentimes required me of love, within this three
months, but what shall I say more. Alas says she, w^ping bytterly, he has
sponne a fair web, for this morning as soon as you were in the fyeldes, the
Rybawde, pardon me sir if so I call him, came hither with such a fury, that I
feared he would have put me to death, but he pursued upon me a thing more
noisome then Death, so that as he was in stryuing to force me, and had done
it, my forces so failed to defend my self, if this gyrle had not come by
chance, the presence of whom caused him to forsake his enterprise.

The old man hearing such pitiful news, remained so troubled and astonyed,
that for a good time he spoke never a word, then breaking his silence, he
says: And is this possible that he whom I have more dearly loved then mine
own life, has so much mistaken his gentleness, that he would dishonor the
love of his father. Ah unfortunate child, and I a father greatly to be
lamented, sith I am tormented by mine own blood, of whom I thought to have
had some greater joy* then he held his tongue and sat down, casting his
lokes here and there, with such countenance that a man might judge the grief
of his mind to be more excessyue then his strength was able to suffer, yet
says he to the Rybawde, I pray thee my friend, tell me the verity of this
fact, to the end I shall not do any thing that may hereafter cause me to late
to repent. Ah poor and caytyfe woman that I am, says the shameless
Pallyard, I see well that if this trompery of your son, had not been
discovered by me, but that by some other it had come to your knowledge, you
would have done such Justice, that men should have taken example by me in time
to come, and now sith I have showed my self so faithful toward you, you
doubt of my faith, and esteem my words for boordes and mockeryes, inquyre you
sir of this Gyrle which has seen all the mysterye, and then do with me as
you shall think good, for I know not well how to live any longer here, where
men give such synister intertaynme^t to them which serve them faithfully. The
old man examyneth the chambermayd, who playde her part better then her
Mistress, and and incenseth the Father so sharply against the son, that he
purposes to punish him so grievously, as the like has never been heard of,
ravished then in this extasye of anger, he speaks a thousand follies, and
was changed into such a choler, by the impoysoning of the dangerouse venime
Ielosy, as one distraught and frantic, and remained in the chamber a great
space rulling his eyes in whytenesse, grynding his teeth, and saying the dogs
paternoster, enraged against him, of whom he thought he had received such an
unworthy outrage, which during the time that this tempest boiled within the
stomach of his Ieleous father, like as some say there is a tempest upon the
Tyrenea mountains, all the Caniculer days, and also in the deepenesse of that
Scicilian Ethne: arrived in the house in an unhappy time, for the torment
turned wholly upon him, the drops whereof did reuerberate upon the unfortunate
father, who coming into the place where he was, the vapors cause of the
outrage of this unhappy fortune, do provoke him against his son, who was
talking with an honest Lady, that lodged within the Castle. The Ieleous and
enraged old man fretting with anger, as one pressed and overcome with chollor,
no less then a Bull, compelled through famyne or desire of company, seeing
the young man, entered into such a frensye, that without speaking what he
would do, he put his hand to his sword, coming toward his son, he says:
Ah infamous traitor, is it I that must seek the means to adresse thy
rybaudry? By God this shall be the last instaunt of thy life. The pore infaunt
hearing the furyous menace of his Father, not knowing whereof the occasyon of
his anger proceeded, says unto him: And wherefore sir are you so out of your
modesty? or what is y^ that I have done against you? sith you are so extreme
rygorous against me, that to my knowledge, have never offended you. The
insenced old man, became more inflamed by the answer of the child, saying to
him: Ah infamous child, can thou talk so bravely to me for the purgation of
thy wickedness, thou shall know by and by what I will do, and to what end the
just anger, yt I have conceived against thy impudency and temerity does tend?
saying so, he rusheth upon the pore infaunt, that moved not, who seeing the
bloody sword of his father to be drawn out of the sheath, yt in steed of
thrusting him through, does prepare him a more sudden death, for he was
upon a little planck, that answers to two lodges, which had no bar at the
entering, to stay one by, or to serve for the assura^nce of the way, not
remembering for fear of the blow, the perrillous place where he stood, he
fell immediatelye from high to the ground, and his evil fortune was so
great, that the first part which touched the earth, does bear sufficient
witness being broken in pieces, and sheding his blood upon the ground, his
head being stroke against a stone sharp in the end, and fastened in the earth,
so with his strength at the same instant, he forgoeth both his soul and his
warm blood, which runs out both at his nose and mouth, the not only cruel
father, but enemy of all humanity, not content to see his son humble
himself, and to debase him before his face, thinking that the child had fallen
by his own will into the dytch, says: Thou have well lopen, for I swear
before God, that thou shalt dye in the pain, out of which thou shalt not
escape my hands this day. Alas what pity is it of a man, after he has
wandered out of the limits of reason? Saul once enuyous against David, full of
the spirit of intelligence, had no reason in performing the pursuit of one
more just then himself. And by profane wrytinges, who did move Euristius to
tormente that subduer of Monsters Hercules? but only wilful malice and
inueterate envy: truly where the sin is not very evident, right would that
mercy should be preferred before Justice, and it is more praise for any
Maiestrate, who following the divine clemency, to pardon things not very
evident, and not so cruelly to exercise the sword of vengeance and rygorous
punishment, for it cannot be otherwise, then yt he which excerciseth himself
in cruelty, shall feel such a torment in his mind, that in the end will cause
him to despair of his health, or else to such a sharp repentance, that the
very prick of that opinion, will not cease for the most part, without
accompanying a man to his buryall, so it chanced in this tyrannyous old man,
who having descended the steps, to see the recovery of him that was
altogyther vnsencyble, he beheld a spectakle before him, that caused him to
forget his affection, that he bare to the unfortunate, who had adrest his body
thither, he seeing then the mischaunce of his son, lying in such poor order,
his head burst in pieces, his body dispearced, and yet styrring, was moved with
such dolor, that he began to forget his Ielosy and to feel such a remorse in
his intrayles, that caused him to detest his fortune, for that he had been so
blinded in his concupisence. Alas, says he, unhappy Father, dare thou show
thy self among any good men, that have put to death such and so honest a
child, for the appetyte of so impudent a Pallyarde: Ah my son pardon me this
offense, for I assure thee that I will make such a solemn amends, that thou
shalt have whereof to content thee, and they which survive an occasion to
vituperate my fury, and sith this my heart (says he, stryking his breast) most
unhappily has received the pernicious venyme of false perswasyon, whereof thou
have felt the bitterness, it shall abide the penitence, and thou my body,
shalt serve for the gift and last sacrifyce proceeding from me, for the
apeasing of the shadow of my son, toward whom I will send my spirits, to
require him of pardon, in the obscure fields of death, and to whom I will
sacryfyce my wicked, infamous, and unhappy life, which my son being dead,
shall be more weary unto me, then that dark voyage, or any other thing that may
disquiet me at al, having said so, weeping sorrowfully, he imbraceth the body
of his son, and beholding his sword, he says. But go to then, sith his
soul is departed, and his desteny has taken him away, murder him that has
executed murder, in the person of him, whom he ought to love most. These
words ended, moved with a dyuilish despair, stamping like a Lion, and
pricked forward I know not of what Furye, as a wild Bore whetting his
Tuskes, after he is hurt by some mischaunce, tourning the mischief upon
himself, in falling on the point of the sword, which passes through the
center of the heart, he tombleth upon the corpse of his son, yet warm and
styrring, and so sheding the common blood of them two, he rendereth up his
soul to him, to whom he had so long vowed it, by his wicked and impure life.
What heart is there that having red this, or in making rehearsal, but would
bewail the chance and misfortune of this desperate old man, who truly had
been excusable in his fury, if the devil had not taken away his senses, and
forced him by the inormitye of his vice, and by the greatness of his sins,
to destroy his own soul. These be examples that be set forth for our
instruction, to the end that the perrill of an other should induce us to
beseech God that he would deliver us from the spirit of obstinacy, and awake
us out of that dream, which does blind our senses, in following the
flattering desires of our concupisence, for otherwise it were great pity to
behold the faults which we commit every hour. This unhappy man blinded in his
sin, forsaking God, neither acknowledged his Justice, nor his mercy,
experime^teth also the fruits of his infidelity, wickedness, and obstynacy,
leaving behynd him, the memory of his deeds, as well for the aduertiseme^t of al
men, as for the imitation, and deterring, not only of the aged, but of all
ages, to avoid the plagues and diuilishnesse of whoredom, which do bewytch and
take away the senses of men, the end whereof is death, and punishment in the
infernal lake. The news hereof were disperced incontinent throughout all the
house, so that the rybawd which had adrest this devise, having heard and seen
the whole, moved by her own offense, and the witness which her mind did
bear of her sin, fearing she should have Justice, if she did not immytate
the illustryous fact of her detestable lover, so that all afraid, she runs
to a pit, into which she leapeth headlong, and wherein she was myserably
drowned, a death truly, although it was furious, yet to good for the punishment
of the detestable malice of a woman, so wicked as she was, which merited to
have all the pains togythers, that ever were invented by men, for the scourge
of evil livers. The^ there was word sent to Milain to y^ Maiestrate, to inform
him, who having in examination the chamber maid, that was the ayder of the
desperate Palyard, made her to confess all the fact, wherefore she was
hanged, and her body given to be meat to the fowls of the air, and no less
was done to ye carcases of the two lovers, which against all right both deuyne
and humayne, had vyolently come to their end, and as for the young man, he was
buried with such pomp, as his virtue did well deserve, and was bewailed of al
estates, for the modesty that did apeare in him, by which he has seemed to
immitate the Scipions and Fabions, who once living with such temperance, have
caused their glorious names to remain even to this day. So always the death
of the well liver is fortunate, for besides that he passes to the life, which
has no end, and goes to enjoy the holy and Godly company of the blessed
souls, he does glorify his memory, by the knowledge that the posteritye have
of his virtue, which is so graven and imprynted in the hearts of their children,
that neither Death nor time has power to deface it. Upon the Tomb of this
young example of chastity, some good Poet of that time made this Epitaph, which
insueth, to show that such as he was, ought to be praised with such Eglogs, and
not any of them which have defiled their lives with a thousand mischiefs.

Love and Ielosy, the Virtue and the vice,
This young and tender lamb have caused:
A fathers wrath unjustly for to feel,
By outward show of malice false deceived.
And eake who was by foolish raging ire,
And cruel dangerous vice, of wilfulness procured:
Whose soul to Heaven, and body to the grave,
To Heaven and earth are now by death assured.
Thus has he changed his life, and is not dead,
But lives with God rejoicing in his glory:
That caused him the hauty Skies t'assend,
And happy to have before him, of virtue the memory.
Thus being dead, he lives without sorrow or grief,
Therefore thou that passest by, thy tears refrain:
If envy do not cause thee to bewail the joy,
And happy state wherein the dead remain.
Such is the end commonly of them that loving virtue, avoid the contrary,
sith the vycyous can have no greater heart breach, then to see one that will not
be infected with their unperfection. Mark wherefore all wrytinges are so full
of deceites, addressed by the wicked against the good, but to the end the
virtuous should know on whom to repose themselves, which is the good God that
will not suffer any of his to perrishe, although for a certain time he seems
to have forgotten them, whereon the contrary part, the wicked do prosper and
flourish as they desire, until the Lord weary of their wickedness, does so
overthrow their doings that they which to fore appeared hauty, proud, and
stately, is converted into derysyon, and despised, or else so well weakened,
that the very tractes scarcely appear.

FINIS.
A Mohammedan slave, reuengeth the death of his Lord, upon his son that was the
Homecyde, and rendered the principality, (being chosen of the people) to him,
to whom by right of Lynage, and succession it did appertain.
ABout the year of our salvation 1494. After that Christopher Colombe, with the
Nauye of the catholic King, Ferdinand, son of John Aragon, did dicouer the
West Islands, not before discovered, that can be found remembered by the
writing of any Hystory, either ancient, or new, Lewys Bartheny Bolognois, as
he himself recoumpteth in the ij. Book of his Nauigations, in coasting by this
country, for that he would have knowledge of the natural things, the manner of
the living of those strange nations, and also to get some profit in passing
by Ethiope, he arested in an I Will, the Capytall town whereof is called, Orme,
not distaunte from the form Land, above twelve miles, where he beheld this
pitiful Hystory ensuing, of an execrable son, and of his crueltye against
his aged father, and upon his brethren, yet in their infancy in this city.
Then a little before the said Bartheny came thither, the Soulden there, was a
Lord of the sect of Mahomet, a man very virtuous and gentle for a More and
Infydell, almost an hundred years old, he besides that he was rych in Gold
and pearls, sith in that quarter there were found the most exquysyth and fair
Pearls that one should see, esteems his age happy, to see himself the
Father of a leven sons, all lawfullye begotten, the youngest whereof, had
better fortune by murder, then good chance, as you may see by this which
follows, for the eldest contrary to the rest, was craftye, subtle, and
malicyous, and the most dessembling Palyard that was in all the country, who
studied with himself diverse times how to become imperious over his brethren,
after the decease of his father. But the Souldan had two bondmen that were of
that Land, of that rich and famous Monarch of the Indyans, that me^ call Prester
Iean, these two Indian slaves were so well affectioned to the doings of their
Lord, that he had made them as rich, as any of his Vassals, and they had so
well got the good will of the people by their natyue bounty, and excellent
virtue, that every one does adorate and praise them as much, or more as the
Prince himself, thus they going about to do good to all men, and to displese
none, made no report to y^ Prince, of that which afterward was cause of the
ruin of some of his subjects, these two by their prudence did keep sylent
the doings of their ambicious young Lord, not for that the Galland did thereby
lose the desire, to do that afterward, which one would not think nor
believe, toward his father, notwithstanding the good intreatmente that the
old man showed him, for the nature of y^ wicked is so perverse, that the more
a man assayeth to obtayn his good will, the more he addresseth his mischief,
and whetteth his teeth in murder, and enuyous for the exployte of his
wickedness, because his heart is so venomous, and full of poison, that he
cannot endure from executing the thing that is contrary to virtue, by the
dangerous infection of his vices, as very well appears in this ambicious
and cruel tyrant, which could not endure or attend, till Nature had fynished
that, whereof she had begone to approach, and already to attain the end, he
purposes not only tyrannyouslye to usurp the domynyons of his father, but to
execute the most detestable act upon him, that a man can either think or
ymagyne, that is, to murder them of whom he had his life, and to fill his
hands with the innocent blood of his Brethren, and for the beginning of this
Tragedy, he causes to be imprisoned under the title of good faith, his
Father, his Mother, and his brethren, except the youngest, by the aid and
succors of some of the house, as good as he himself, for truly the
boldness of the wicked is vanished, as soon as it is excogite, if it want
companyons to attain the end of his imperfectyon.

Absalon had never adrest his force against that Myrrour of patience, David his
father, without the counsel of Achitofell, and without the aid of murmurers,
that abused the pacyent clemencye of the King. But O good God, what enorme and
strange Tragedyes have every one seen in the Empire of the East, that is
stained with the blood of Fathers, shead by the Children, and of the light of
the children, obscured by the hands of their own mothers? And in our memory
the only desire of raygn, has caused that at this day, the crueltye of the
Vicont Myllinois, should be had in memory, to declare how many ways the
ambicious do disguyse themselves, to come to the end of their desires, that I
am constrained to say, that our age is so wicked, and so void of pity, that
a man shall find children that fear not to put to death their fathers by
veni^e, thinking to cover their wickedness and grievous fault, by the means
they be not bound by any law ordained for Paracydes, against whom neither
Moses the first, and great law maker, nor Solon would establishe any law, or
make ordynances, assuring themselves, that it were impossible that the child
could be so unnatural, as to stayne his hands with the blood of him, of whose
substance he has had his beginning. But to return to our matter, this wicked
son being possessed of al the^ of this blood, that he thought could impech
the execution of yt which he had taken in hand, he caused their eyes to be
plucked out of their head, A monsterous and most cruel (...).
without exception of father, Mother, or kyndred, O barbarous act, and very
worthy of the place and country, that ingendereth and brings forth nothing
but mo^sters, he which saw the light by yt means of an other, stops the way
to enjoy the same received goodness, to him by whom he had inioyed his. This
galla^d then, not content with this wicked fact, extends further to
accumilate, vice upon iniquity, and more and more to set forward their ruin
that were almost at an end, for in the chamber where the pore old man the
Soulda^ his father, accompanied with his wife, did bewail his misfortune, and
torment himself for his blyndnesse, the wicked and enraged dog does thither
conduct his.ix. blinded brethren, that by their evil fortuno* the might more
grieve the old man, and entering with them, he says: Make hardly good cheer
togythers, for I will go to prepare that whereof you shall taste, y^ father hearing
this incorporate devil to speak, says unto him: Ah Wolf most cruel, and
insatiable of the blood of thy friends, what? have not thou done vylany enough
to the most unhappy old man in this world, without making him so to lament,
and to lea^e such a memory of thy wickedness before the eyes of men* Fynish
murderer, execute thy crueltye, and fulfill the ^elony of thy heart, go
tyrannyously enjoy the goods of that house, of which I had made thee (without
putting thee to this pain) y^ peaceable possesser, but I hope this shall not be
without the great confusyon, and chastisemente of thy detestable life, for God
is a just Judge, that will never leave unpunished a treason so great, and a
crime so pernicious. As soon as the father had fynished his words, a man could
not have hard the noise of thonder in the chamber, so excessive was the cry of
y^ pore infants, for to perceive themselves in such mysery, and to hear the
just complaint of their good Lord and father the Souldan, who did comfort
their evil as well as he could, and as well as his own misfortune would permit
him. But the murderer willing to see an end of his wickedness begone, (not to
gratify him which had desired him) but fearing as long as his father was in
life, The wyck^d Tyrauntes, always in fear, and full of suspicion.
the people would rise against him, and go about to slay him, or else would
chase him out of the I Will, as he which could not, or might not raygne without
the executing of an act so abominable, and therefore I say at the same hour,
he causes to be brought a great quantity of wood and fagots, into the Chamber
of the unfortunate blind folks, and commanded, that they should be set on
fire, addressing him to the p^^yentes, he says: To the end you may more
clearly see to find the way into the country, whether I will send you, I have
prepared this light, which may conduct you in steed of a guide, and as for me
(says he) laughing it shall be a clensyng of my sins hitherto committed, in
making a sacryfyce so clean, and fair an Oblation as I will make of you:
Having said so, he caused the fire to be put to their miserable bodies, which
in the same instaunt, were converted into Ashes, and he delivered from the
care to have any man as he thought, that might impeache his government. But
the Tyrant remembers not at all, God the revenger of al wrong and iniquity.
that the reward of the wicked, is always peased in the equal Ballaunce of
Gods Justice, and that they which hope to avoid the rygour of punishmente by
their own forces, do fully experimente the vengeance of the Lord for their
own wickedness, as afterward this detestable bloudsheader did euidentlye
perceive the evetable furye and just anger of the Almightye for his
wickedness, whose future fortune caused him to forget to murder in his former
slaughter, the two Indian slaves, and his younger brother, which knowing the
miserable end of all his blood, fails not to conuaye himself into the
Mosque, a place so sacred amongst them, that they think it Religion to
forbear to vy^late them that retire thither, to conserve their life, and to
defend them from the severe rygor of the law, in which place then of their
devotions was this pore child, and young Prince remaining, as the future
Revenger of this tyranny, crying with a high voice, and witho^t intermissyon: O
good Lord, good Lord, beholdest thou not at all, how my Brother has changed
himself into a Dyuell, the Father of all wickedness, and has taken upon him
the manners of the enemy of all humanitye? Alas will thou suffer the blood of
my Parents and Brethren to be shed innocently and that the son shall
remain without vengeance* Has not the flame and the smoke stopped and taken
away the voice of them that required thee of Justice, for the greeuousnesse of
their torments? Behold, O mighty God, and visyte the sinful life of this
Tyrant, who dispysing thee, has depryued them of life, by whom thou gave
him his own in this world; and surely the just color of the young Prince,
against the furyes of his Brother, had no less taken away his senses, then
was once the child wanting his speech, or the son of the Lidian Cressus,
beholding his father in danger of death, during the sack of the Town, by the
great army, and souldyars of the Monarch of the Meades. But the mesure of the
iniquities of this Paracyde, was not yet come to the fullness and end, which
during these things, made the people to understand the death of the murdered,
pronouncing moreover, that if they went about to refuse to obey him, he knew
well how to proceed to compel them. The people seeing him well accompanied,
and that he was wholly seized of all the fortresses, craftily and wittingly,
submitted themselves willingly to his obedience. O Beast of many heads, thou
show well that in the foul fantasy of such a multitude, reason, equity, or
prudence, can have no place, and surely the contynuall waves that cause the
Seas to ebb and flow, have not so many motions and troubles, as the counsel
and opinion of a multitude has deliberations, for there needs but the
interposityon of one day, and the rest of one night, to overthrow all that
has been before concluded, and all the choice of opynyons will be cast to the
ground, by the blast of a simple sedition, and folly of the people, the
counsel of whom are more governed by temeritie, and sodayn motion, then by
reason and sage forsight of that which may come after, neither the constrained
obedience of this multitude, nor the force of his Souldyors, that were wholly
weary of his proud and cruel Tyranny, nor yet the inexpugnable strength of
his fortresses could impeche that which the divine providence had ordained for
the punishmente of the factes of this wicked creature, who loved better to
raygne one Month alone, then a long time after the decease of his father
reverenced of the people, beloved and served of his brethren, and not
punishable by the justice of men, beholding nor feeling his mind guiltye
before GOD, by the conscience of his own misdeeds. Mark how he himself made
the Net wherein he was entangled, and whetteth the knyfe whereon he myserably
ended his life. You have heard how the two Indian ^laues were returned into
their own houses, after that the fury of this Afrycan Nero, had shed forth his
poison, and that his brother lived with the Priests of their law, bewayling
continually both his Parents and his misfortune to see himself so weak and
vnfauoured, that he could not revenge the death of them, that being dead,
caused his sorrowful life, and the absence of whom, made him so unprofitable
in all things, and so unhappy in all his deuyses.

The Tyrant then as it might be, or as it is more true, wearye of his life,
could no longer avoid that which the heavens had ordained for the just
punishmente of his vniustyce, and demerytes, delyberatyng now with himself, to
take away the light from the eyes of the two aged Indian slaves, which he could
not commodyously do, as well for the reverence that the Souldyers bare to this
lincked couple, as for that he knew they were well beloved, and cherished of
the people, wherefore he purposes a new treason, to bring his desire to pass,
without any slander, and without incurring the evil will of the people, and
of his great army, that is, in practisyng the one to be the murderer of his
companyon, and afterward to punish y^ murderer according to the law, and his
deserts, therefore he causes the more ancyent of the^, named Mahometh, to be
called unto him, who being come to the presence of the Soulda^, says unto him:
It has pleas^d your noble majesty, my Lord, to cause me to be commanded to
come before you, to whom I am obedient, being here ready to imploye my self
to any just act, wherein it shall please you to use my diligence and loyaltye,
which I have so well showed, and with such integritye, during the life of the
former Souldan your Lord and father (whom the great Pr^phet Mahometh feeds
this day with delicious Vyands in Heaven) that there i^ no man which can
reproach me in any thing that may in any wise de^grate my na^ie. That is the
only cause, says the Tyraunte, wherefore I have caused thee to come before
me, assuring my self, that thou will be no less at my commandment, then thou
have been obedient to the pleasure and will of my predecessor, I will that thou
^i^erstande further, that if thou shall serve me faithfully, in that wherein I
will employ thee, thou shalt not repent thee of the deed, for besides the
pleasure I shall receive of thy service and endeavor, thou shalt obtain a
Prince so much thy friend, as thou can or would desire. My Lord, says the
slave, not for any hope of riches, being so terrestyall a thing, so vain, and
of so small duraunce, I will go about to attempt any thing, neither to see
my self exalted to honors and dignityes, (sith this is the Chair wherein men
are most daungeroas^y placed) but you shall behold me ready prepared to
execute all your honest deuyses, only for the reverence I owe you, as to my
Lord and Prince, which I trust will not command any thing, that without
stayning mine honor, and blemyshing of my conscience I cannot execute. Then
the slave thought that the Tyraunte would have given him in charge, to have
fetched the young Prince out of the Mosque, to the end, to cause him fe^le his
crueltye, which the good man would not have done for fear of death, nor to
have been Emperor of all Africa, as he afterward shows by effect. Be as
it may be (says the cruel Soulda^) it is that I would have thee put to death
Caime, for so was the other Slave called, sith he has done me such a
displeasure, that if I see not his death, my spirit cannot live in rest, or
contentment.

Ah my Lord, says Mahometh, command me any other thing if it please you,
for my heart will not suffer me to see his death, much less to kill him, whom
I love as mine own life, and with whom I have been brought up even from my
birth, if he has done any fault against you Lordship, let him be accused
publiquelye, according to the custom of the country, to the end he may
receive punishment, according to his deserts. The Souldan (dissembling his
despyte and cholor) answers him very courteously: I am glad that I have such
a servant in my power as thou art, and I thank thee for thy good
advertisement thou have given me, concerning my duty to justice: Moreover,
think yt all this that I have said unto thee, is to no other end but to assaye
thy constancye, and make a proof of thy fydelitye, thou may therefore
depart when thou shalt think it good, and hereafter I will unploye thee in
some better thing, and of greater importance. The slave which knew the
venyme of the Serpente, and how deadly it was, failed not after he was
re^yred, to guard himself from the bushments and treasons of the Tyrant,
persuading him self that he would assaye that against him, wherein he had
failed against his companion, and in that his opinion deceived him not, for as soon as he was departed from the presence of the Souldan, the Tyrant enraged
and invenimed, sent to seek Cayme y^ other slave, unto whom he uses like
words, as to the first, and persuades him so well, yt the wicked Moore
swears unto him to kill his companyon, in what sort he could. Behold whereunto
the execrable malice of men does exte^d, that through the appetyte of a
pernicious Tyrant, the one friend has coniured against the life of him, that
a little before, had refused to make him to lose his own. But always the
wicked (what frawde so ever he does excogitate) falls into the pit, that he
has prepared against him, that doubts nothing of his treason, and corrupted
heart.

This venerable slave, then having the commandment of the Souldan, he
departs, m^^^ding to murder Mahometh, to gratifye his Lord, who moved by the
covetousness of that which the Suborner does promise him, and by the obedience
which the subject owes to his soueraygn, and without thinking what is the
nature of the tyrant, who pleased with discords, searches nothing but to
imbrue himself with the blood of his Citizens, and who in the end excerciseth
his cruelty upon them, that have been the ministers of his misdeedes.

Cayme then without feeling any remor^e of Conscience, that might have
withdrawn him from his purpose, came toward Mahometh his Companyon, who had
not so little aduysement, but in his heart he perceived the matter, and began to
doubt of that, which was true, and he held himself more assured, when as he
beheld the murderer more nearely, which by the color of his vysage, gave
sufficient appearance of an act not common, that he would commit for all the
passions and motions of the spirit I know not how, by some natural means
ar^ evidently known, either by the face, voice, or exterior gestures, for the
face is the port of the heart, manifesting the will and secret desires, that
one would assay to keep secret, therefore Mahometh adressing himself
toward him, says: Ah false murderer, and disloyal traitor, what* will thou
go about to execute that, which the Tyrant has wickedly commanded thee, and
thou haste lightly agreed unto* now I will take such revenge of thy Corpse, as
I have been required tofore, that men a long time hereafter shall speak of it
through all these Islands. Cayme that knew the humor of his companyon,
addresseth himself toward him, as well for that he knew him to be a valiant
and hardy souldyor, as for that he would not auow any matter against him, he
casts himself at his feet rendering into his hands his sword, praying him to
pardon this fault, that he had attempted, more for fear that the tyrant would
have slain him, then for any desire of hurt or evil will that he bare to
Mahometh, who answers him. Whereof thy fault proceeds I am not ignorant,
but thou could not by any thing have better showed or more euide^ly
manyfested thy dissoyaltye, which if it had taken such deep root in my
spirit, as thou have received, and taken it* into thy perjured heart, thou
may assure thy self, that long agone thou hadest been dead, the Tyrant
satisfied, and I without a companyon, and as it might have been without life,
sith this Tyrant in pursuing the death of the one, desires the total ruin of
us both togithers, but it has pleases God that no treason should enter into
the mind of Mahometh, and that he should finish the course of his age without
revenging the death of his Lord, and likewise the wrong that without his
deserts, has been purposed against him, therefore Caym go toward the
Souldan, and tell him that thou have executed that which he commanded thee,
and for the rest let me alone, for I will provide such a remedy, that in time
to come, the life of the virtuous shall be in more assurance, then now they
be in perrill under the tyranicall government of this Dyuell, whom by Gods
help, I will punish for his wickedness, and revenge (with a privy injury) the
wrong that he has done to all the inhabitaunts of this I Will.

Cayme having escaped from such a danger, promyseth him to do all, that it
should please him to give charge, to execute, which was to his great
preiudyce, for after that he had told the Tyrant how he had bathed his sword
in the blood of Mahometh his companyon: The Tyraunte full of ease, and
contentmente began to show himself very familyer, then coming chearefully
to embrace him, his coming was no more joyful to the pore slave, then was
that of Ioab to the two Princes of the great Hebrew Armies, Abner, and A^asa,
sith he holding his left arm embraced and infolden about his neck, takes
into his other a short Dagger, wherewith he stobbeth the pore slave so far
into the side, that he tombleth stark dead, at the feet of y^ false and
traiterous Lord. This is the happy end of the wicked, that cannot at all
escape the strength of Gods hand, either by the mynistery of me^, or by the
cruelty of wyld beasts, and somtymes by things without life or se^ces,
prepared nevertheless for the exployte of such punishmente, as once the tree
was the ^^ourge of Ab^a^on, whereon he was hanged by the horsemen, and slain
by the hands of Ioab. But now the Souldan thinking to rejoice himself for the
death of the two slaves, whom he so much feared, not having well put up his
gleue, and returned to his seat: Behold Maho^^^ ^^th very well accompanied, and
armed at a^poyntes, comes in, at whose arryuall, the most part of the
Souldyors began to be in a fury, the others laying a way the right of arms
rendered them to his mercy, but he which sought the chief, made no stay or
great accoumpt of them: Thus entering into the chamber, where he beheld the
stretched Corpse of Cayme, and where yet was the Emperor, with a small company,
who seeing Mahometh, although he was surprysed with fear seeing him in such
array, yet making a virtue of necessitye, coming to encounter with him, says:
Ah Villayne, son of a Villayne, art thou yet living? Yea (says Mahometh) I
live in despite of thy Menaces, and false ^^^entions, ready to send thee to
all the diuils, to serve for their pray, trusting in God yt he will give me
strength to revenge upon thee (most disloyal of al disloyals) the death of thy
innocent parents, of whom thou haste been the inhumayne bloodshedder. In
saying these words, and putting their hands to their* weapons, they joined
togythers, and although the Souldan defended himself always very^ bravely,
yet the slave, a man very strong, brave, hardy, and always brought up in
wars, and who for his good deed had the aid and favor of the God of that
Coast, acquyteth himself so well, in less then an how(...) at the Tyrant
was able no longer to supporte the strength of the blows of Mahometh, but in
the end, began to declyne toward the earth, the slave by little and little
became victoryous setting his shield upon his throat, to make him to yield
himself, which being done, he causes him to be straightly bound, and delivered
unto the people, who suddenly rent him into a hundred thousand pieces, so that
he was not esteemed to be the child of a good mother, that had not done some
injury to the carcasses of the miserable tyrant. O just judgment of God, he
that tofore never thought himself enough worshipped of his subjects, is now
slain by their sedicions hands, to the end that every one should evidently
perceive, that goods unjustly gotten, always give the salary of their
injustice to the greedy desyrer, the vyolater of right, and of all religion.
After the death of the Souldan, they made dilligent inquisytion of the
complicis, and executers of his cruel murders, who being accused and conuicte,
were rygorously punished, according to their laws and ordinances. The people
perceiving themselves so bound to Mahometh, for that he had been the deliverer
of all their Country, and the punisher of such an offense, which they
dissembled by constraynt, gave unto him the government of the I Will, and would
absolutelye have invested him in the seignory. But the sage old man knowing
very well both the inconstancy of fortune, and the vndurable good will of a
multitude, and not ignorant also, that he which under the title of good faith,
occupyeth the goods of another, cannot choose otherwise, then engender the
ruin of his successors, and commonly give cause of his infamy and total
dishonor, therefore having set the affairs of the I Will in good order, he
causes upon a day, all the estates of the country to be called in counsel,
before whom he made this Oration.

There is none of you my good Lords which are ignorant, The Oration of
Mahometh.
that I was borne in this your Island, and much less of the blood and race of
them which ought to raygne over the people, I have been brought up, and
nourished as a slave in the Court of the former Souldan, father of this wicked
parracyde, of whom, and upon whom, you have taken condign vengeance for his
wickedness, I beseech you refer all that which I have done, or yet shall do, to
the honor and obedience of the virtuous deceased Lord, and to the memory of
those goods, which I have received of him, and also to establish and pacifye
the Signory, to the youngest son of him, who as you know is fugitive in the
Mosque, since the day that his brother the Tyrant, made the horrible slaughter
of them of his blood, I therefore am of this mind, if you also shall think it
good, that the succession, he being of the right ligne, should be by you
rendered unto him, for I have not at all purposed to usurp any Land from the
son of him, to whose name during my life, I have borne such honor, as the
servant to his master, and the Vassal and subject to his Lord. Therefore
I resygne and remyt into your hands the supremidence, which of your good wills
you have given me, both over you, and over the Lands of my Lord, and your
Prince, unto whom by your means, I may serve to give counsel in all his
affairs, by which if he will govern himself, I will assure you, that you
shall understand you have o^elye changed a man, and not a virtuous and gentle
Prince, always thanking you, for the amitye and good affection which you have
borne me, which if God give me life, I hope to satisfye, by all kind of
humanity and duty of a good friend, and as an obedyent servant of your
commynaltye.

The people abashed of the virtue and continency of the good old man, who
forsaking the honors vnte which their election had called him, loving better
to live a pryuate life, then to enjoy a whole country, without having just
title of possessyon, do easily accord to the counsel and sage opinion of
Mahometh: So the young Prince was fetched from the Temple, and placed in the
seat of his father, with this condicyon, that he should have always the old
man for assystaunte and counceller, and by whose hands should pass all the
affairs of importance, that might chance within the I Will.

Behold a notable and rare example of two great extremities in the virtue of
one man, the assurance and Magnaminitye to revenge a public iniurye, upon
one that of him self was public, if by his vice he had not made himself
more abject, then the least of the common and popular multitude, and the
modestye conjoined with great reason and foresyghte, to despise that, wherefore
almost all men at these days do take and adresse, for what occasyon soever
it be, the bloody battayles, profayning the sanctitude of Religyon, perverting
the order of judgments, redusyng and rendryng all things into wynd, and
adnychylatyng the charity that every one owes to his Neighbor, for with a
huge heap of sins and curses they a^tayn their Lordships, and within a while
they forget the effusyon of blood of the good citizens, and not appeasing the
incursyo^s that in the end they overthrow themselves, as is the flower by the
heat of the Son, in his full force, and as was latelye seen in the
tyrannous rule of the Myllinois of our time, and once in the raygn of the
Persians and Greeks, the Monarchy of whom, was like a flame, that vanishes
away quickly, as did their domynyons, after their establishement.

FINIS.
The Marquis of Ferraria, without having regard to fatherly love, caused his
own Son to be beheaded, for that he was found in Adultery with his fair
Mother in law, who likewise lost her head in Prison, by his commandment.
IN the life of Phillip Vicont Duke of Millayne, son of John Galeas, he y^ so
often made wars against the Florentynes, and their Line, then reigning in
France, Charles the seventh, that good King, which chased the English men out
of Normandye, the most excellent and mighty Prince, Nicholas of East, the
third Marquis of Ferraria (he that for his singular wisdom had been sent so
often as Arbitrator, to determyne the controuersyes, that chanced amongst the
Princes of Italy) made war against his own Cosyn, called Azzo of East,
which with the aid of the Venetians, Floren^ynes, and Bolongnoys (although he
were a bastard) did chese the said Azzo, lawful and just successor of the
Marquisdo^, out of Italy, and constrained him to end his days in exyle, in
the I Will of Candy, aunciently called Create, and he because Ferraria was
obedyent unto him, as unto an unjust usurper, does govern them so politickly
and trayn the people so gently, that never any of his predicessors lived more
quyetly, he being confyrmed in his estate, espouseth in his first marriage, the
daughter of the Lord Frauncis of Cararya (after y^ Lord of Padue) by whom he
had one son, which at his christning, was called Hugnes, the bewty and
phis^omy of whom did promise some future dexterity and excellency in him, this
is he of whom I intend most to entreat, as chief cause of the description of
this history, he was surnamed by the pleasure and will of the Father, the County
of Rouigo, and kept with such care, diligence, and study of them that had the
charge over him, as did appertain to the Child of such a Lord as be, which
commanded over Ferraria. Certain days after the birth of this young Prince,
the Marchioues his mother departed this life, to y^ great grief of her
husband, which loved her no less, the^ his own self* and to the displeasure of
all his subjects that wholly had tried such curtesy, gentlnesse, and liberallity
to be in her, as whose like memory has not left engraven in the hearts of y^
posterity, this young Prince as he grows in years, gives such testimony of his
future virtue, and wisdom, that a man should find a few Lords of such a raxe
in all Italy, that did excel him (so much are they in fault that suffer
themselves to be overcome) if that fortune had not given him such a foil, as
the process of his years did forbid it in him, which had given such a
beginning to his honor. But what if the affectyons of men do ebb and flow,
and never continue in one state, as the unquiet moving of the sea, it is no
otherwise of the judgments and ordinances of God, whereof there is not one
left undone, without coming to the end, ordained by the presence of him, for
the end of the county could not be evil, as every one thought, by the
conjecture of the virtue of his young years, but behold the end.

This Marquis Nicholas being very young and lusty, after the death of his wife,
deliberating with himself not to marry again beginning so well, as he that had
the evil will of none of his neighbors* to take his ease, and to pass his
time in such delights, that every night he changes his pasture, and
continuing his wantonness, does his endeavor so well, that the troop of his
Bastardes were not inferior in number to them* that were begotten by the old
Priam of Troy, a little before y^ Greeks did beseege it, and to the end that the
hystory shall not want any thing, which should serve for the succes of that I
will se^ forth, touching the misfortune of y^ county of (...), the son of
Nicolas. There was remaining to y^ said Marquis no other child to succeed him
lawfully begotten, but Lionel y^ eldest of the B^^cards, after who^ was that
famous and renowned Lord Borze, the son of a Damsel Senoyis, of the house of
Tolomey. This Borze for his virtue, and for that he had done some service to
the Romayne church, was created and erected in the Dukedom of Ferraria, by
Paul the second of that name, Bishop of Room, then reigning in France Lewis
the leuenth, and Frederick of Austryge, holding the imperial Crown, by whom
afterward the said Borze, was proclaimed and made Duke of Rege, and Modena.

But retourning to our purpose, the Marquis having now long time lived without
a lawful wife, was desired, as it might be, of some of his subjects, to
persuade himself to ^emarrye, who practices so well, that he takes to Wife,
the Daughter of the Lord Charles Maletest, which because he was puissaunt and
of great Lands, might command over many Cittyes and Villages of the Marches,
and Romans, who had the name to be one of the most brave and sage Captains
amongst all them that profess the Art of war in Italy in his time. A little
after the Marquis, who although his wife were very ^ewtifull, yon^, e^elye of
seuent^^n^ or eyghteene year old, left not to haun^e light women abroad,
that it was thought he had taken a wife, more to satisfye his friends, or to
cover his wanton and effemynate will, then for to chasten himself, and to
increase and multiplye his raze, which was the cause that God for his
punishment sent such a slander into his house, worthy surely to be noted, as
well as it is strange and possible, if the memory thereof were not fresh, it
would seem after incredible, for the patience of God is such, that he
attends the conuersyon of the sinner, but seeing him indurate in his
wickedness, does punish him so sharply, that the generations ensuing, do
behold the sharpness of the punishmente, and mark wherefore that good
Christ, second to none in patience, does so dilligently set forth examples, to
show that there shall be no sin left unpunished in the presence of the Lord,
for what greater ruin can come to the house of any Prince, then the dishonor
of him, or his? What greater sorrow, the^ to see the shedding of his own
blood? and it is always the Justice of GOD, to practice that upon them, which
continue their disobedience, accumylate evil upon evil, and provoke the Lord
by their wickedness, as did this Marquis, the wife of whom, seeing herself
so despised, as she that presumed ouermuche of her bewtye, could not so
greatly command her constancy, nor so well moderate her affections, but that
she did complain her to a Damsel, whom she had brought with her forth of her
country, and whom she trusted very well, who being one day in the chamber of
her mistress, seeing that in secret she was sad beyond measure, and that
daily she waxes worse and worse, was so bold to say these, or like words
unto her. Madame, I beseech you think it not strange, if the desire that I have
to do you service, do make me so bold to demand of you the cause of so sodayn
change yt I perceive in you, which had wont to be the only solace, of the
anguishes and sorrows of my Lord your father, by your plesantnes, if perchance
there happened unto him any grief, and now you do nothing but sorrow, sigh,
and complayn: I beseech you Madame, if ever I have done any thing in your
service, that meriteth recompense, to do me this pleasure, and honor, to tell me
y^ occasion of your disquietnes, to the end yt if this power that is in me, may
do any thing for your conte^tment, I will employ it with the life yt I have
vowed so long time, to be obedient to your commandments. Alas my friend, says
the Marchiones, I am ashamed, being such a one as I am, so to torment my self,
beholding me so conte^ned of my Lord y^ Marquis: I assure thee, that if the
hope of some allegiance did not comfort me, thou should behold what
sacryfyce. I would make of my life to the crueltys of him, that has made more
accoumpt of one of these common and despised women, then of me that am his
wife, and not inferior in bewty to any of them. What Madame? answers y^
Damsel, have you no other cause to disquiet your self, then the foolish love
of my Lord the Marquis, truly this is a very small occasyon, and a cause more
then fryuolous to vex your self, lay away all this from you, and assay to live
joyfully with them that love and esteem you, attending til time shall cole his
arde^t desires, and cause him change his affection, take good heed that he
have no cause of misco^tentment, for to quite him of his passions,
apprehensions, and unseemly companyes, in the mean time, joy you only of y^
which is yours, not using such folly as to stain your honor, by unlawful
acquaintance with any other then of him, which is given you for Lord and
Espouse, with shortning of your life for such a foolish mistrust, proceeding
of that evil* Ielosy. O God (says the Marchyones, all bedewed with tears)
how true is that, which every one speaks in a common Proverb: the whole ca^
easily give council to them that be sick: Ah my friend, if you felt the
disquietues that will not suffer me to take any rest in my mind, and the cause
of the bitterness y^ does bereue me of my senses, I am assured that having
pittye of me, thou would council me of an other sort, or else help to
execute that, which should serve for the intyre solace and contentmente of my
spirit: the Marquis has led this life a long time, and it is impossible that
he should change, but by death, or extreme age, and in the mean time I
pass my time in vayn, accompanied without comforts, that procures me to
ouerpasse the night with tears in steed of rest, and the day against my
will, I am merry to content him, that shows me no pleasure, no not that which
he ought by the sacred rightes of those bands which have co^ioyned us
together, would God death had taken away my life in the Cradle, to the end that
not remaining unto this present, I should not have felt of what force is the
despighte of an honest Lady, being deceived by her husband: Alas, how happy
are they of base condition, that may without great conscience inaculate their
blood, that does redound but to the shame of a few: Ah honor and Nobillitie,
how tyrannously do you bridle the Ladies, that how much the preferment is
before men, the estate of all should not be alyke, to the end, that the people
should not shadow our brightness, more then the re^own of the common sort of
men and women, which dye with the memory of their deeds, that are buried in
the same tomb with their bodies, or if the Laws did as well punish the
disloyaltye of the husband as the simple women, that by a natural vice, are
sometimes forced to forget themselves, even till they be overcome by the
appetytes of the flesh, how joyfully would I revenge my self of the injury
which that perjured and unloving husband has done to me? because that every
couple should equallye receive the pain and punishmente according to their
demerites. But after the Laws were made, they were Tyrauntes over us, the
inquyetors of our rest, and the common Ennymyes of o^^ perfection, who did
authoryse them without the ^yde, help, or consent, of any of us: After that
she exclaymeth, as one half enraged, saying with a voice that declared the
vehemencye of her torment, and the mutacyon of her mind. But sith I must dye a
thousand times, if so be I let this pa^se without punishmente, I would he well
knew it, that I intend not to live with such grief and sorrow, as he has
given me cause a good time, and then let chance what may, for this is a
torment great enough, as I believe, to abide such a Tyranny, and to feel the
puissaunte pricks of love, the better whereof is no less to be wyshed, then
death, having said so, the Marchiones holds her tongue, attending the
answer of the Damsel, who having a long time bethought her self, answers
in this sort: Madame, as yet I never had experyence of what might the force of
love is, and by that means I have never felt what is the disdayn and sorrow of
them, that perceive themselves deceived of him, of whom she ought to be the
intyre and only beloved, yet I believe nevertheless, that the passion both of
the one and the other is so great and unmeasurable, that the surplusage of the
alterations that trouble and grieve the spirit, are nothing in respect of this
inexplicable distress. The argument of this, I take of you Madame, the
Constaucye of whom is so troubled, by the outrage and fury of Ielosy, that
heretofore has ^^uer given suspicion of change, or miscontentmente of heart:
But O God, I behold and perceive the imbecility of humayn mynds, and how well
they are disquyeted of diverse and unlawful desires, which take rest no more in
the stomach and thoughts* then the sea Sands, instate with a whyrle wind, in
an extreme hot day. Ah Madame, where is the great Chastity y^ made you once
renowned before all the Ladies of Italy? I beseech you assay to contayn your
self in that honest reputation wherein hythe^to you have lived, to the great
content of your Parents and friends. What? if reason have so little force in
you, that you deliberate to follow the vice of wantonness, and to search
another for the accomplishment of your desires, then the Marquis your husband,
by all means do the thing so secretly, that the house whereof you are come,
receive no dishonor, and your self merit infamy and grievous punishment. The
Marchiones answers nothing to the sage admonition of the wise Damsel,
beginning to think with herself, not by what means she might wythdraw her
husband from the disordered and wanton life that he led, but rather how she
might revenge her self, and with whom she might give him y^ counter change,
in punishing him by the same fault. But reason does not extend herself to
this end, that sin and virtue should be placed alyke, for virtue is the
superlatiue above her, contrary, which is put under her as a subject, for the
instruction of any that knows not what is vice, let him take heed it fall
not out other wise, that if any be forgetful of his honesty and void of good
manners, we by his example, launche not forth and let slip the brydles of our
hearts after vice, as after some rare and precious thing, and always this is so
well practysed at this day, that men esteem Vice but by the syghte of them
that do it by example. Does or may this come before the place of Equitye and
right? and merit no reprehensyon, of this you may well assure your self, by
the foul deliberation of this wilful Pryuces, which does suffer her self
to be so blinded by her noughtye and vuruelye appetytes, that do peruerte the
common order and right of nature, which the laws has constitute amongst men
for the reu^rence of blood, persons, and civil honesty: becomes extreme
amorous of him, whose wanton toys, ought more to fear her, then the memory
of Death himself. I have declared before that the Marquis had one only Son
by his first wife, a goodly Gentleman in perfection, and which during these
furies of his fair mother, was attained to the age of eyghtene or twenty
years, it was he of whom the second Phedrya became amorous, but this was not
he that deserves to be put in the virtuous Role of Hypolytus, the son of the
Amaso^, in resisting the amorous folly and incest of the Marchyones, happy was
that Greek heir, for he dyed by the iniust displeasure of his father, which
was no shame to him at all, having lest, in that which the other did, that
has given sure testymony of his love to virtue and modesty, but the other has
made his vice and naughty will known to his own Father, as you may easily
perceive in the readyng of this Hystorye, now this young Prince seeing himself
intertayned very familyarly by his mother in law, that took no pleasure, but
in the contemplation of the bewty and good grace of the county, did never
think that such disloyaltye could lodge in the heart of his fathers wife,
and therefore he deuiseth to requyte it her, but with such reverence as the
Child owes to the mother, which she takes not for any denial, having a
desire of a more strayghte familliaritie with him, which the more she desires,
the more she is inflamed in her former flames of love, and doing her diligence
so well, by her own self, because that the young man, for that he as yet had
not practysed love, knew not how to take heed to her countenances, signs,
wanton looks, syghes, and vuperfyte words, that to one more sub^il, might
easily have discovered her passion, she forgetting and despysing both her
honor and life, (if the Countye had made the report thereof to his father)
does deliberate to discover unto him her affections, for, (saying to her
self) how shall I cure my aleadged evil, if I keep it secret from him, of
whom I intend my safetye, is this the way: to deuyse the occasyon of
famillyer curtesyes, that I do unto him, truly his tender youth does deny
him to see so well, and to know the most difficult humor, which were enough
for a man that perceyueth the deuyses of the mind, well if he were so subtle
and expert as to perceive it, yet his shamfastnesse intermingled with fear,
would let him to attempt that, which I desire so much, and (as it may be, he
will not refuse me) therefore I will be the first that shall expel this fear
and bashefulnesse that so impeach my joy, sith it is I that have felt the
amorous flames, and suffered the pricks of the sharp Arrows of Cupido, I hope
that although the enterprise be great and dangerous, he will not refuse me,
and that if my great bewty cannot move him, if my ardent and fine imbracements
cannot kyndle the fire in his heart, nor my love in his Breaste, yet I know
well by what Chase and Nets* I must take him, then chance what may, if I
dye for it, I will cause him to understand by mine own mouth, (sith imbassage
is perilous in a matter of such consequence as this is) that which I suffer
for him, also I will desire him to remedy my passion, otherwise I have already
excogitate the means to provide for my unhappy and desperate life, having
found out this plot in her mind, the iucestious and vile woman searching with
herself, by what means to execute it* Fortune was so favorable, that the fame
time Phyllip Vycont Duke of Myllayne, sent to fetch the Marquis Nicholas, for
certain affairs of great importance, for dispatch whereof, he must remain
certain days at Myllayne, wherefore the Marquis of Ferrarin, having addressed
his Train, takes his journey toward the Duke, of whom he was the Allye, and
greatly beloved, which was no displesure to the Marchiones his wife, for it
came very fyt, that her husband being absent, she might practice with the
unwary county, for the accomplishment of her concupiscence, and for to procure
hi^ in time to come, to pay the arrerages of the absente Marquis, by her
deuyse, that were payable, and for that certain days after the departure of
the Marquis, the fair Fool being after dinner in her chamber, fantasying the
means to perform the plot of her desires, takes a Lute in hand y^ she
causes to sound so sweetly, and with such cunning, that the Damsel her
Secretarye, was as one having her ears depending of the stringes of the
instrument, during which the Marchyones made her voice agree with the sound,
singing this that insueth.

O Cupid thou; which do in hauty Skies,
Amongst the great, and deuyne Gods soiourne:
And eke that present art with terren wightes,
To cause their hearts, with lovers laws to bourne.
To thee O God, whose Bow and golden Shafte,
Does wound both Gods and men alyke:
And causest every one, ^o yield themselves to thee,
And subjects to become, for all Dyanas spy^e.
To th^e^l make, and swear my fyxed vow,
If I by help of thee, my wyshed joys attain:
Then must I only praise thy mighty Bow,
And subject will to thee, for evermore remain.
THe Song ended, she begins to search her thoughts more deepelye then
before, and shows well by her countenance that thy^ was no other thing, then
the common passion that she imagined, that so troubled her thoughts and exte^
your countenance, in the end vanquished with the extreme desire of her
pleasure, she commands the Damsel whom she so greatly trusted, to go
cause the County Hugenes alone to come unto her, for a matter of great
importance, and which should very well content him, to whom the Damsel
obeyes, not without great suspicion of that, which came to pass, for it was
she alone that perceived the wanton looks and sighs, sent forth by her
Mistress, when she was amassed to behold the Countye, before whom when the
Damsel was come, she says unto him: Sir, my Lady desires you to come talk
a little with her, for a thing that appertains to you, whom you shall find
in her chamber attending with good deuotyon, as I believe, to communicate unto
you, a thing that hitherto has not been known, devised, or perused by you.
The Prince taking no regard to the words of the Messenger, but guyded by his
mishap, goes to the Chamber of the Marchiones: During this, the Damsel that
went to seek the Countye, knowing well that the inormitie of the case that
she imagyned, does withhold her to go again to her Mistress, because she
would not impeach the joy of her, whose life she had seen led ^yth so much
sorrow, re^yreth into a wardrope, where she (presaging the misfortune of the
fair couple) being confounded with tears, in the end agreuaded with sorrow,
and set upon by slumbring, through weariness fell on sleep. Then the County
being entered into the Chamber of his fair mother, she coming toward him,
to receive him very courteouslye, takes him by the hand, and causes him to
sit down by her. But when it came to the point, that the fair Lady would have
addressed her train, her heart begins to leap within her belly, her senses do
deny to fulfill the office of the exteryoure members, for her tongue was mute,
her eyes deiecte, and her vysage changed into such a Vermillyon, that she
would have abashed the vant corrour of the Son, and surely this change was
caused of two contraryes, that is to wit, love, and shame, the one would have
her show forth her grief, the other direct contrary, by natural will and
inclynation, but in the end, the more imperfect and less puissaunt in the good
cause, became victoryous, for the Lady, after she had syghed a good space, with
out speaking any word, wearye of her indiscreet silence, as she thought it,
in the end breakyng her silence, with a look which was suffycyente to enter
into the depth of his heart, (such was her cunning to move him to compassyon)
having her voice tremblyng, and evil assured, for the contynuaunce of that
which she felt in her mind, and sustayning diverse affections that moved her
spirit, she took the young Prince delicately by the fair hand, saying unto
him: My Lord, if I had not many occasyons to address my lamentations, and
just complaynts, you may believe, if it please you, y^ I am not so vnshamfaste,
as to deceive your ears, and by mine own means to manifest before you a
thing, that although as it may be, you shall think it very strange, yet it
does touch you so near, that for the love which I bear you, that are more
dear unto me then you think, I cannot, nor am able to keep it from you, for
in so doing, I should wilfully betray you, and should do both against my
conscience, and the duty of her toward you, that holds the place wherein I
am, I know you are not ignoraunte of the life that the Marquis your Father has
led, since the death of her of good memory, your Lady and mother, and what
troop of Bastardes every one sees at this day in your house, which if God do
not otherwise provide, shall use no less inhumanitye one day toward you, then
your father did once toward his Cosyn, the lawful inheritour of this
country, whom he expulsed, and sent in exile into Candy, for I see as well
the small account they make of you, as of me, which have wished a hundred
tunes y^ I had never come into this country, not only for the greefs that I
have felt, but also for that I forsee the mischiefs that are prepared for you,
if you do not wisely prevent the^, I neither do nor would have you think, that
I counsel you to fill your hands with the blood and life of him, of whom you
had your beginning, but I would have you understand, that I give you this
advise, that you open the eye of your intendme^t, to forsee to what end these
things may turn, and as for me, there is nothing in my power, wherewith I will
fail to succor you, since it is even you, to say the truth (says she)
imbrasing and kissing him, my dear friend, whom I love and esteem more then
any man that lives, which if it please you* I will cause you know by experience.
O would to God yt the hour of my alya^s had succeeded after my mind, truly no
other should have inioyd the daughter of y^ Lord Maletest, then the County
Hugnes, for when my Lord and Father did entreat with me for the marriage of the
Lord of Ferraria, it was you whom he talked with me of, and not the Marquis,
God pardon the folly of him, that so foully deceived me, sith y^ union of us two
had been far better denysed, the^ with your Father, the age equal, and the
co^fyrmity of manners y^ might have conjoined us with a perpetual band, which
now am bound against my will to him y^ despises me, and who it is that loves
and cherishes y^ mothers of them yt one day, as it may chance, shall depryue
you both of your honor and life, then think my Lord what sorrow it should be
to me, in that I had lost the means to be perpetually yours, and consider
what should be my life to come, (loving you as I do) if I should see the
ruin, and destructyon of your estate. Alas, God is my witness, with what
anguyshe I open these my secrets unto you, for the desire that I have, that
you might be wholly mine, as I am yours, is so ingrafted in my heart, that only
death must make the separation, in saying so she kysseth and imbraseth him of
an other fashyon, then a chaste woman does embrace her Parents and familliars,
and then she retourneth to her former purposes, saying: Therefore my Lord and
greatly beloved friend, be not you the occasyon of the death of her that
seeks to increase your honor, and thereby does render her self of a most
unhappy, the fortunates Lady that lives at this day, have pity of her which
so liberally and prodigallye offers her self unto you, but if crueltye have
more place in you, then the prayers I make unto you, and the synguler love that
I bear you, kill, kill, I say (my Lord) this miserable Lady, the which if you
refuse, shall not cease to execute that upon her self, whereof you made the
refusal, which will be the occasyon both of your dishonor, and the loss of
the best and most loyal lover, that yo^ had in this world.

The County no less abashed of the words, then of the wanton imbrasinges of
his fair mother, was so far beside himself, that without aunswering, or
having power to depart from her, remained no less immovable, then was once
the wife of Lot, turned into a pillar, and Rock of Salt. The Marchyones who
was excellent fair, young, tender, and delycate, and whose lokes were so fine
and gracious, that I believe, if the most wylfull and abstinent of the
Philosophers of former time, had felt the temptation of an object so fair and
celestyall, they would have quyte left, forsaken, and forgotten, the
contemplacyon of natural causes, to have given themselves to execute the very
effects of nature. I think also if the Daughter of Mynos, had been of like
b^wty, good graces, attemptes and intysementes, as was this Lady, I doubt not
at al. But that her Hypolite, although he were froward or lunetyque, would
have enjoyed and cherished her, and left Diana, to have sown his seeds in
the Garden of her, that with such instaunce required him of mercy. This fair
Temptaresse, then seeing her lover in such alterations, and so surprised with
shamefastenesse, also because he had not shown any semblaunce of displeasure,
with any thing she had done, she purposes to pass further, and to stryke
whiles the Iron was who^e, to the end that the young Prince, during his dyners
thoughts, should not measure with reason the greatness of his misdeedes, and
the abomination of the sin which he committed against his father, in using the
person of her, in whom the blood of his had been mingled. Likewise, because he
should not discover the great perrill and danger, wherinto he cast himself
headlong, in taking the vnhapy counsel of y^ wanton cou^seller. Therefore she
cast her arm over y^ neck of the Prince, kissing and embracing him in such
sort, y^ at the last, the pore County yielded to y^ assault, who being once
intised by her unseemly pronocations, and wicked doings, not only fulfilled y^
which she s on aughtily desired, but was so inflamed with that rage, and
impoysoned with the venim, that love had spread over the coraly^e cheeks of
this new Phedra, that begi^ning to set apart the duty that he owes to (...)
father, and to the honor of the Nuptial bed, the vyolating whereof, has ever
brought with it the ruin and dishonor of the violaters, he was so far
estraunged from his former modestye, that he kisseth the mouth, lips, ^yes,
as also the white and delicate neck of the Marchyones, then passing further,
he extends his hand over her two round Dugs, that by their equal and like
quantity, cause two little hills eleuate a little above the stomach of the
fair Lady, at the entrye of which, there breaths a wind that makes th^^n
fynely* ry^e and fall, according to the passions that move within the center
of her heart, he then beholding his lyce^ce to touch any place of his pleasant
ennemy, puts his hand to the place most desired, and in which lovers seek
to obtain the mercy of love, and then feeling her ^elly that was round, hard,
and more white the^ the top of the A^lpes, after that the winter had whyted the
with frost, she then shrinking away from him, perceiving that she had overcome
him so fynely, shuts her eyes, fayning a pleasant and no great
displeasure, that did well declare her desires, says unto him: Alas my dear
friend that cause my death, oh that you would quench this fire that consumes
my life, and whereof I am ^ure you feel the quick sparks, at which word^s, the
Princ^ was so chafed in his Harneys, that without using his former reu^^ences,
he takes that part in Music, which he never tofore had cried, and found the
accords so sweet, and so correspo^dent to his pleasures, he purposes to
continue the^ if in case it should seem good to his mistress, which was not
so unpleasant, but that having found the beginning so well done, by the measure
and freedom of him, she easilye gave her consent. Mark and behold here the
second Act of the Tragedy, that thou may see, if the joys and pleasures of
men may be pertual, and if it be not more a do for the Nobles to keep secret
their ^olies, then for the mean sort to manifest them, and surely they are a
great deal sooner espied in the chief of the common weal, then in the
members that are more weak, and of less puissaunce, for where the head is
troubled, it is impossible that the members should not feel some apprehensyon
of their mishappe and sorrow. This is the cause why men entreat always of
Princes, and make so small accoumpte of the doings of the pleban sort, the
memory of whom vanishes away so soons as the wind. But for that these two
could not well deuyse all things themselves, without having a third person,
they intend to imparte their affairs to the Damsel, that was sent to seek
the County, and which doubted of that, which they had done togythers. To her
then, after the County was departed the Chamber, enamoured and inflamed of his
loving mother, the Marchyones, addres^e her with a countenance more gay, then
accustomed, saying: My dear friend, you have seen in what ease I have passed
my time hitherto, and the small joy I received during the presence of the
Marquis, but GOD has so provided that he is absent for certain days, to the
end that I should make prouysyon for the time to come: of that which I stand
in need of, and by this his absence, might get my self that goodness which
should end all my evils, I have chosen me such a lover as nature cannot shape
a more perfect, either in bewty, liberallitye, courtesy, or worthynesse, and so
n^ole, that he is the second in goodness to Nobillitie herself, which I
imparte unto you, for that I have known you hitherto both wise and faithful,
to keep my secrets in such sort, as they ought to be, also you are she that
has heard the communycations of my former affections, and the simple
objections, for the apprehe^ding of my love, reason would also, I should
manifest unto you, to what end all this tends, and that which follows,
trusting only in your virtue, and honest discretion, that you will keep
secret this fact, as the persons whom it touches do deserve, and as the
good and affectionate amity, which I have borne you requires. And as she
would have continued her purpose, the Damsel impacyent to be solicited,
says unto her: Would that God, Madame, had cut of the threade of my years,
when I first set my foot in this unhappy house, for by that means, I should
have avoided two evils, whereunto my misfortune does throw me headlong,
without which I might otherwise have lived, for (all his Daughters whose I am)
it shall be a great dishonestye, to use a service so unseemly, both for my
age, and estate, and which shall fall out in the end, consydering the
abomination of the fact, that I think, that I must see an offense that will
cause the total ruin both of you and him, for whom you address this foolish
and naughty devised advise, not for that I am she, which inte^d to defanie you,
for death shall be more agreeable unto me, as God shall receive me, then to
see an accidente so prejudicial, both to your age and honor. But alas, the
judgments of GOD are so right and so equal in the Ballaunce of his Justice,
that there is nothing done there in vain, I know, and GOD sees, says ^he
(fe^^hing a sygh from the bottom of her har^) with what anguyshe I lame^^e
this, that the Countye is he (O GOD the only remembrance makes me blushe in
witness) which is the Liefetenant of the bed ^ and the incestyous ^^^yuall
of his own Father, it is he that for your sake, brings vengeance upon
himself, and which thinky^g to remedy you^ greefes, has composed a medi^yne
so bitter, that the only smell will cause such an horror, that he will curse
the hour a h^^dered times* wherein he began that, which as I perceive, he
has executed. Alas, would God that I were a false D^^ynatresse in this? But
as for you, Madame, hold you assured of my faith, by which I swear unto you,
that what torment soever shall happen, whether it be sorrow or death, how
ignominyous soever it be, shall not force me to say any thing that may
denigrate the honor of my Mistress, conserved hitherto with so great and good
reputation. Moreover Madam, employ me in what it shall please you, for sith the
thing is done; the counsel thereof, is already taken, and you shall see by
experience and effect, how I am minded to do you service, in that it shall
please you to employ me. Ah my dear friend, the^ says y^ Marchyones, how your
words have pierced my heart* whereby I know you have told me the truth, but
what? the force of love is so great and vehement, that I cannot tell how to
withdraw myself now from it, that I think my desteny has done it for my
contentment, and also because amongst all the humayn passions, this is it that
has the preference, that cannot be avoided with any forc^ or study, that one
bestows, and therefore I des^re you to talk no more of this misfortune unto me,
for we will use such providence, that the most clear sighted shall not know what
to think, only ins^ruct you y^ County of yt he has to do, and of the hours at
which he may co^modiou^ly come unto my chamber, it is now in your hands my
friend, that you may end both my life and honor, and that yet hold the good
or evil Fortune of the Countye, in your power. Thus there passed certain
Months, that the two ^oners reioysed together, without any of the Coortyers
suspectynge any thing, of so detestable a Felonye, and exeerable abhomynacyon,
who although they beheld the courtesyes that the Marchiones showed to the
County, and whom she then intertayned very familliarlye: But they thought that
she did it to please the Marquis, to the end that he should not think she
hated the children of his first wife, and also for that as I said before, the
County was so honest and courteous, that he ravished the heart of every one
toward him, which did yet confyrm the opinion of the Gentlemen, that this
amity of the Lady, toward the young Prince, was extended only for the sole
virtue and gentle nurture of the Countye. But Fortune that cannot forget her
Nobillitie, and the heavens angry for an act so infamous, and an iniurye so
detestably committed, both against God, and against the Father and husband of
both the offenders, styrred up a more wyly and subtle discouerer of secret
faults, which is Time, who did the office of a good Servant, after that by the
very foolishness of the two lovers, their folly was made euydent, they
governing themselves so indiscreetly togythers, and with so small respect of
persons, time, and place, that in the end blinded in their pleasure, and
glutted in their ease, they thought that Time would always have been so
favorable, as she had been almost the space of two years. Now let alone the
Marquis of Ferraria, that doubted nothing of the great dishonor that his
son did unto him, and of the false connaye of his wife, which sent him unto
Cornouall without a Boat. It chanced that a y^oman of the chamber of the
miserable County, began to suspecte something of that which passed betwyxte
the two unfortunate ^onglinges, for he saw ordinarilye that as soon as the
Marquis was gone any night into the Town, to vysyte some of his Concubynes,
the Countye failed not to go all alone out of his Chamber, which was the
cause that he assured him of his doubt, and therefore purposyng to seek out
the truth (behold the just judgments of God) which seeing the malice that
men have to commit evil and detestable sins, often times gives speech to
young Infantes, or wisdom unto Beasts, to publishe it. For this cause he
begins to spy all the deeds, countenaunces, acts, and words of the
Prince: and the enterprise of the gallant succeeded so well, that after he had
be thought of it, being in a Wardrope adjoining to the Chamber of the
Marchyones, mark the dyuyn^ permissyon. The sin being come to the rypenesse
of his abhominatyon, he espied by chance a small hole in the wall, which was
just over against the Bed, wherein she lay ordinarily, by this Creuyse then,
the clear eyed spy, hoped to see that, which so long time he had desired and
imagyned, and as he saw the enemy of nature before him, he makes a thousand
signs of the crosses* with such an abashment, that then he would not
believe, that which he saw euidentlye with his eyes, in the end beholding the
thing more merely, and perceiving that he was not deceived at all, he says
very so^tly to himself, and by God it shall not be long, before I will also
make the Marquis to understand it, to the end, he may punish the one of his
foul temeritie, and the other of her great wantonness, and lascivious
incontynencye, now he attending oportunitye to cause the Marquis to view this
pittyous and v^ruely Spectacle, behold it chaunsed two or three days after,
the unfortunate Prince, not doubting the treason, which the yeoman of his
chamber did commit, that so sone as he saw his father gone into the stable to
view his Horses, even then he went into the chamber of the Lady, to continue
the way begone, within the bed of his Lord and father, but his Argus which
slepte not at al, following him by little and little, and having seen him
enter the listes, returns toward the father, to show him that, which so long
time he had desired, and to make him judge of the unfortunate Lovers. This
Traitor (although his fact has some apare^ce of Justice) arrived before the
Marquis, says unto him, al abashed and astonished for yt he had seen: My Lord,
if time did suffer me to show and declare one of the most wicked factes that
ever chanced in Italy, I should cause you to maruayle, and (as it might be) by
resyting so strange a thing, I should make your cheeks to blush, and inrage
your heart, so abominable is the case, but because I would not make you loose
yt discourse, may it please your noble Lordship to come alone, whether I will
conduct you, and where you shall see with your eyes, that which I cannot
commodyously resyte unto you in order. The Marquis which was a man of a good
courage, and desirous to know rare and strange things, went with the guide eue^
to the place, where he saw the act playde, that afterward was the death of the
chief persons in the Tragedy, then says the spy unto the Marquis, I beseech
you my Lord, to contemplate a little through this creuise, what life they lead
in your absence, that since you are present, the disloyalty of the^ that be most
(...) unto you, is so evidently shown. The good Marquis had no sooner looked
through the (...) then he spyed his son interlased and ^^folde^ about the
neck of the Marchiones, and the wantontoyes of the Lady toward the County,
the Father of whom was so constant, that he attended to what end these
imbrasementes and toys would^ come, but when he saw the Game would redounde
to his disadvantage, and to the perpetual infamye of his hoase, with great
pain he observed himself from being overcome with rage, and that he had not
broke open the door of the Chamber, upon the Camp, where were these couple of
unfortunate Lovers, to have caused them to dye upon the very fact, always the
passion of his mind, was so penetrable, that he could not by a good space
remove from thence, but remained there wholly troubled and confused in tears,
running down along his bearde, that now begins to wax white, in the end,
euaporating the order of his heart, he began to say.

Alas, unhappy old man, that I now shall be, that notwythstanding the flower
of thine Age, art dishonored by thine own blood, and the substance of thine
entrayles, what is it the only son (amongst them that be lawful) which
has unlawfully abused thy Spouse? shall I be both the witness, Party, and
Judge in this cause? and in executing of this judgment, that I must needs do
both by law and just displeasure, I shall put to death two persons, that I love
best in this world: No, no the amity of Marriage sha^ end here, toward her,
that has put out the light of my honor, and has blotted the reputation
common to us both, and the charity of the father toward the son, shall
lose his force in me, sith the child in usurping the Bed of the Father, has
given conjecture of his will, to take away the life of him, of whom he had
his own, and of whom he has stained the honor. What if once a Roman
Captain, has punished, as it might be, to seuerelye his son? in that he
had surpassed his commandemente, touching a certain expedition in deeds of
Arms, whereof although he had gloryously attained the wyshed end of his
desires, then what shall I do, beholding my self so vyly betrayed? and so
evil dishonored by him, which ought to be the revenger of the crime,
whereof my eyes have seen the execution, I beseech God that pytty may not move
my heart to pardon him of this fault, or to dissemble this great and extreme
hartebreache, that living, causes my death, and so reuengyng a pryuate
iniurye, I shall punish the most abhomynable sin, that a man can think. Then
for the quietness of my mind, and example of Justice to the posteritye, my
son shall dye with the unshamefast love, which was cause of all this, and by
which means I shall depart from my only lawful begotten son, and from my
honor, which is more dear then children, riches, or life. The sorrowful and
enraged father with this deliberation, seeking to execute his deuyse, his son
departed into the base Court of the Castle, without thinking of the perrill, or
ruin, that his mysfortune did prepare for him, and their bands the Ball with
the Gentlemen of his age, where was greater company of people to see the
play, then were there of long time before, for I think, that some conjecture
of the future Spectacle had brought thither this route, to the end that with
more shame, the County and his incestyous Lover should be imprisoned. Also
these be the Menaces, wherewyth God threatens the wicked, that their pryuye
sins committed in the obscurity of the night, shall be one day punished
openly, and to the sight of all the people, during this then, that the
unfortunate Prince (more brave and joyful then accustomed) did continue his
play, behold there comes the keeper of the Castle, with a good troop of
Archers, well appointed, he in the presence and hearing of every one, addressing
him to the Countye, says unto him: O Prince it is now full time that you
make ready your self to come before other then these be, where you must
answer to the coniurations, Fellonyes, conspiracies, and facts, against the
person of my Lord the Marquis, your Father, by whose commandment, says he,
putting his hand to his collar, I make and co^stitute you his Prisoner, I am
sorry for your misfortune, and more sorrowful that it should be I that must
keep you in prison, always trust in your great simplicity, and likewise, if
it please you, excuse that which I do, being constrained by him, which has
power both over me, and you: O extreme force, and rygor of the conscience,
which moueste so lively the hearts of them, that feel themselves guilty of any
fault, that the blast of every wynd that blows, and by the wagging of every
lefe that they see move, they think they behold before their eyes a torment,
and a contynuall punishment, that will never suffer them to take any rest,
whereof comes the great grief, and the small assurance that they have of
themselves, which are so troubled by the very interyour judgment of their
own spirit, that they give sure wytnes of that thing, which (as it might have
chanced) otherwise had been in doubt, so the pore Countye seeing himself
sommoned to go espouse and defyle another bed, then that wherein heretofore he
had received so much contentment, failed not then to think of the accrosyng of
his evils, and the small hope that he might or could have to be delivered,
therefore half attached with despair, he says unto the Prouest. Go forward
Captain, whether it shall seem good unto you, for of long time I have attended
no other entreaty of him, then that which I now see prepared for me. No, no,
my Lord, says the Prouest, have a good heart, God is able to aid you, and
puissaunt to make every one to know y^ right of your cause, also my Lord the
Marquis will do nothing against you, without the counsel of y^ most wise and
learned men of his house, which ought to cause you to hope of some better hap,
then you think of, and then he conducteth the Prince into the great Tower of
the Castle, which stands just against the Port Delyon. And during this time,
there were some gone in like sort, and by like commandment to seek the
Marchyones, as they had done the Countye, who then was amongst her
Gentlewomen, playing this song, as the Prognostication of her misfortune, and
the Prophecy of the common Buryall, that united after their death, the executed
body both of her, and the Countye.

THe man by council of the Gods,
In this low earth that's placed:
Has not so many joyful days,
But one mishap has them defaced.
And unto whom has not Fortune assigned,
For every joy, a hundereth greefes to taste:
Why should I then my self so sore annoy?
And shead so many tears, day and night in waste.
The Pleasure which my nourishment does give,
And cake my weary troubled mind does case:
That only joy which should my life sustain,
Is fled away to shorten now my days.
Alas (O God) alas, what means this chance?
That of mine end so sure a sign to be:
As cake a token plain of grief for to ensue,
Of much unrest and great mischaunce to me.
What must I see of him the cruel death,
By whom my perfectness does come:
O God, O God, that all things do behold,
Thy holy will for evermore be done.
And cause thou me imperfect wight,
To see thy glorious throne in highest Sky:
Sith every one alyke by death shall end,
And highest State on earth, that lives, must dye.
AS soon as the poor Lady achieved the end, the Marshall of the Household
using the same embassage to her, as before to the Prince, carried her Prisoner
unto another tower, a good space from that, wherein the Prince was enclosed.

The Marquis during this stir, beholding all the world astonyed, to see a
thing of so much maruayle, and a Spectacle so cruel, as the imprysonment of
his son, that should one day suceeede him, and of his wife, whom he had so
derely loved, because men should not accounte his fact unlawful, or cruel
Tyranny, he procured silence to be commanded, and before a great company of
his Barrons, and household Gentlemen, with a grave Majesty, that exteryously
gave evident token of his interyour grief: After he had spent an infynite
number of tears, accompanied with sorrowful sighs, he began to say: What one
amongst you all, my good and loving friends, can well brook that, which is
lately done by me, both upon my Son, and upon the Marchyoues, for that you
know not the true occasyon, and by that means, you esteem me an unkind
husband, and a Father severe and cruel, against all right and reason, and
would it might please God that your playntes were lawful, and that I had done
wrong in this, truly then my dear friends, I should have no occasyon to
make you partakers of my heaviness, nor of the sheddyng of those tears that
you see run down along the face of him, that without them, cannot express
unto you, the just cause of his dule, and also the great reason of his so
sudden crueltye, (if it ought not to be named equitye) that never heretofore
has showed any effect of his mallyce, toward any man that lives, if first
he have not given him the occasyon, for it is no less praise worthy in a
Prince, to govern his people with gentleness, equytye, and clemencye, then to
punish the sedicious, and disquyetors of the peace, because that such patience
showed to one, should not be the common ruin of all the whole people. This is
it, whereunto he ought to extend all his force, no less to chasten the
temerritye of the foolyshe, then to recompense the fydelitie of them, which
has served him faithfully, showing all the office of obedience toward their
Lords. What if the law do inioyne this duty in the Vassal and subject*
toward the natural and liege Lord, nature conjoined with the law, do
constrayne and more straightly bind the infants, which owe to their Parents
honor, obedience, piety, and al good succors, not only of that which is
exterior, but also of the interyour it self, which is the good will and
perfect amitye, by which the heart of the Son ought to be united with the
pleasure and will of the Father. But O immortal God, what Father would be so
pittious and merciful, that seeing the Knyfe of his son upon his own throat,
and could stay him, would suffer him to depryue him of life? But what? life
ought to be equal to honor, for the atchieuing and attayning whereof, all
the noble and gentle minds have once despyced, and yet do despise their lives?
Alas my friends, the complaynt which I make before you, is against my son and
wife, the forgetfulness of whom, is extended even unto the defacyng of mine
honor, wherein both I, and my predecessors have passed our age, I will bring
you no other witness then mine own eyes, that have seen one of the most
abominable and wicked facts that a man can think, it is that which I cannot
speak, without an unmeasurable grief, and without hanging my countenance,
for the shame he has done me. That is, the County Hugnes has defiled the
nuptial bed of the Marquis of Ferrarya, his Father, and the soueraign Lord of
you all, it is he that has polluted the house, that is counted in the raygne
of the most noble in all Europe, this is he that incestyously has vyolated
the secrets and pru^ties, the entrance whereof, were lawfully permitted to
none, but me alone. To whom shall I complain? and who shall revenge me of
this iniurye? Alas, my heart breaks, my senses fail me, and my forces are
weakened, only there remains a desire to do Justice, not that it might be
condign to the abomination of the fault, but that I might thereby take away
this blot from my stock, and moderate a little the grief that pricks me, and
which yet serves for the repentance of them that have offended the Majesty
deuyne so greououslye, that their doyngs have given cause to them that come
after, to blase abroad the follye of their youth, and in saying so, his speech
failed him, and overcome with sorrow, and the unpacience of his cholor, he
founded in the arms of his Gentlemen, who carried him into his chamber,
greatly abashed of the wickedness of the two offe^ders, which they believed,
as well for the reuerences of him that did witness to have seen it, as for the
remembraunces of the impudent looks, and lascivious toys of the Marchiones,
toward the Countye, that made them think it was she that made the pit,
wherein both she and the Countye were intrapped, as soon as the Marquis was
come to himself, there was no man so bold that durst say any word unto him,
but depending wholye of the will of their Lord, were of that advise, that the
process should be quickly dispatched, and that Justice should be done to the
two Patientes, as well for their comfortes, as to give some contentmente to a
Father rightly duspleased against his son, and as a husband deadlye hating
the Palyardyse of his wife, toward whom he sent one of his Counselors,
with two good Father Friars, men well lyked of the people, both for their life
and learning, the one to carrye the heavy and sorrowful news of his death,
and the others to move him to repentance of his sins, and to pray to God to
have mercy on his soul. As soon as they were come before the young Prince,
who seeing the Counceller, and hearing the sentence of his death, he began to
say, weeping very tenderly. Ah unhappy flesh, and filthy desires, it is for
thy pleasures that I must dye this day. O unhappy wretch that I am, not for
that I dye, but because I am the procurer of his choler, and cause of his dule,
and for that I have set such trouble in his house, as shall not so well, and so
sone be forgotten as I would wysh. Alas my Lord and father, pardon this
detestable offense of him that has used himself otherwise toward you, then the
child ought toward y^ father, I confess I am the most miserable, that ever
was born of a mother, and the most detestable yt the Sun shyneth on this
day. Alas good Lord, suffer not my soul to be punished, serving for the
pasture of that vile serpent and devouring Lion, that does nothing but go about
to deceive and invyron us, and cause us to fall into his lake. O Lord have
mercy, have mercy on me, and suffer not the blood of thy son to be shed in
vain for me. Alas I must dye, not for the confessing of the faith, and
glorifying of thy name before men, but for my own wickedness, and the
multitude of my demerites, yt which next after the great wickedness committed
against thy dyuyne majesty, does grieve me most, is the sorrow of him that
does, and will redounde to my mischief and dishonor. But O my God, I beseech
thee to comfort him, and give me strength patiently to abide this infamous and
cruel punishment, that I see even ready before my eyes. The Counselor seeing
the repentance of the Prince, moved with co^passyon, began to weep, and
departed out of the prison, went to make report thereof to the Marquis, who
answered him, it is not now time to become a good christyan, sith he cannot
escape the just vengeance of God, by the mynister of his humain justice, and I
beseech God that he will pardon his sins, and receive him amongst the number
of his elect: saying so, left of, not able to bear the sorrow which did grieve
him, for the remembrance of the approaching death of his son, wherefore it was
ordained that they should be quickly dispatched, one in ye sight of the other,
and this was done, for yt the Marquis would here no admonition, for he heard
the sentence was extended as well upon the Countye, as upon her, that had made
no suit for her life, because she saw they had condemned ye county, then in the
end seeing she had done the fault, she appoynteth with her self to receive
death, in as good part as she could, which was given to every of them in their
tower, within a mynute of an hour, not without an infynite number of tears
shead and besprent, as well by the Marquis, which could not dissemble his
affection, as by all the^ of his house, that universally loved the fair couple
of unfortunate Lovers, y^ virtue of whom, this vlot except, could well have no
comparison, but a little Leven, as says the Apostle, does easyly raise,
season and sower a great piece of dow: likewise, a vice so slanderous, does
obfuscate all the brightness of the former virtues, and impoysoneth the good
savor of all the forpassed life.

These two Patients being executed, whylst men were preparing of rych and
accustomable Funerals, they were brought into the base Court of the Pallas, to
the end all the world should see and behold the cause of their death, that
yet renewed the tears and complaynts of men, as well for the one as for the
other, bewayling the one for his worthynesse, the other for her curtesye, and
them both for their great bewtye, and youth, wherein they were, for as yet, the
more aged of them, had not attained the age of two and twenty years.

After this the Marquis caused to be prepared a rych and sumptuous furnyture
for their funerals, and with such pomp as their greatness did require, their
bodies were brought to be buried in the covent of Saint Frances, and there was
erected a Tomb to be the common bed of the bodies of them, whose hearts had
been surely conjoined togythers, when they were alive, so these two miserable
creatures had a small ease, for the enduring of so great a punishment, and for
all the contentment and satisfaction of their desires, they had this only good,
that by one kind of death, they both should end, and have their bones enjoy
one Sepulcure together. Here it is good to be aduysed, how and with what
counsels men ought to forsee things, and their accurrenses, before they be
executed, here may you gather also what is the nature and condition of sin,
which once ingrafted in the hearts of men, spreads his roots so broad, that
by great pain it cannot be exterped, but by the disolucyon and death of the
subject, whereby they are chief cause of their own ruin. A good example
certaynelye for the youth of this age, which without aduysement of the dangers
that the flesh and the Prince of this world do prepare for them, to their
great shame, use pryuate company with them, that be of their kyndred, without
aduysemente that the most sage have once failed in these doings, and have
perpetrated the things that are unworthy to be thought, and punishable only by
death in them that commytte them.
