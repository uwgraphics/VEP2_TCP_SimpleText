A discourse of the navigations which the Portugales do make to the Realms and
Provinces of the East parts of the world, and of the knowledge that grows by
them of the great things which are in the Dominions of China. Written by
Barnardine of Escalanta, of the Realm of Galisia Priest.

To the right woorshipfull Master Edward Dier, of the Court esquire, John
Frampton wishes increase of woorship and of all felicity.
THere was brought me not long ago right woorshipful Sir, out of Spain, a
discourse in the Spanish tongue, of the Navigations that the Portugales have to
the kingdoms and provinces of the East^ parts of the world, and of the
intelligence of the same Portugale Nation, which they now of late have gotten
in those parts of the greatness of the Dominion, and politic government of
that Famous Country China: And finding in the same discourse a verification,
by new, late, and present experience, of this our age and present time of many
things, written long ago by Paulus Venetus, which work of Paulus I did
translate, and about a year past dedicated to your worship: I became the more
desirous also to translate this into the English, and the rather because this
work seemed to have a certain affinity in matter, and also contained great
variety of things, not contained in the work of the said Paulus Venetus:
And fynding now in England many excellent men in the Art of Navigations, and as
well able to endure extreme heat, as extreme cold, and to cross the burnte
line, as also able to pass the cold Zone, and frosen Sea, and with all youth
and frye of the Realm, both infinitely abounding: and also exceedingly
inflamed with desire to attempt new discoueries, I the rather decreed the
translation hereof, and was fully persuaded that the great Almighty GOD has
wrought the one and the other, to the end that he would have his son Jesus
that has brought salvation unto the world, known to nations not yet
discovered. For what more pleasante Sacrifyce can we offer in this life, unto
our GOD, then to labor in all that ever we may, to bring the Barbarous to
Civility, the Rude to knowledge, the superstitious to the true and lively
worship of his name, to win them from darkness to light, from cruelty to
courtesy, from vanity to verity, from death unto life? If we be not borne
to profit our selves, but to seek the aduau^ceme^t of Gods glory, how
commendable an enterprise is that? how highly to be wished? how much to be
furthered, which not only increases the profit of our country, but
augmenteth the number of the faithful. Therefore God having decreed to make
himself known as well by our English Nation in some quarters of the unknown
world, as he has of late years been by the Spaniarde in West: and by the
Portugale in the East. And being moved to take in hand this small
translation, by persons of sundry callynges, and especially by diverse most
excellent Pilottes, Masters, and towardly young Mariners, much exceedyng in
knoweledge and godly life many of that profession that have been heretofore: I
have, other needful business set aparte, performed their request: And the
thing that I much desired, for the love I bear to good discoueries: And now
dedicate the same to your woorshyp, as a special favorer of all good
knowledges, and of all enterpises tending too the glory of GOD, the honor of
your Prince, and the public benefit of your Country, beseeching your
woorship too take the same this my translation in good part, as a poor show of
a mind willing to requite some part of your bounty and benefit received at
your hands, not doubting but that this may give light to our Nation and
work in many respects benefit too all such, as shall by the Northeast, or
by the Northwest attempt discoueries of Dominions and Territories, wtihin the
circle Artike, or with out the same to the Tropicke of Cancer* And thus wishing
unto your woorshippe the favor of Almighty GOD with increase of all
knowledge Divine and Humane, I take my leave and cease to trouble you.

From London this first day of October. 1579. Your worships in that he may, at
commandment. John Frampton.

To the excellent Lord, Don Christopher de Roias, Sandouall, Archbishop of
Seuill, Barnardine of Escalanta, wishes all honor. etc.
MOst excellent Lord, the haughty and high purposes, and the wonderful
enterprises of our Spaniardes have been so great, that they have not well
near suffered in all the compass of the whole world, any Seas, any Islandes,
or Territories, that they have not run unto; and whereof they have not woone
some knowledge, against the opinion of the old Philosophers, and
Cosmographers: wherein they have found such diversity of people, and so many
differences of laws, and superstitions, and so many sorts of gouernmentes, and
such diversity of manners, that they have no small admiration to think of the
same; and namely of that which they do report, of the Majesty and power of
the king of China: who being a prince given to idolatry, and that way most
vain; As also his subjects, in the observation of the Gentiles laws, are
notwithstanding endued with so great wisdom and discretion in natural
things, and in the government of their common wealths, that no other nations
(be they never so politic) seem to pass the^, or have therein the advantage
of them, nor yet to have the like wits, for all manner of Arts* Which have
been the causes that mooues me too write the things of this realm, (which
have been known as well by relation of persons of credit that have been in
it; and also of some of the natural people of that Country of China, that
have been brought into Portugale) and to dedicate the same too your excellent
Lordship, acknowledging my self in all things most bound unto you my Lord.
I desire your lordship to accept of this little service supplied with good
will, as of a poor token of my good grateful mind, which only has been
but to give all honor to your name.

A discourse of the Navigations which the Portugales do make to the Realms and
Provinces of the East parts of the world, and of the knowledge which they
have of the great things that are in the Realm of China.
The first Chapter shows of the beginning that the kingdom of Portugale had,
and of the success it had from the time that the king Don John the first did
conquer Cevta in Barbary.
Amongst many knights of the states of Almane, Flaunders, and France, which
came unto the long Wars that the kings of Spain had with the Moors,
which had conquered the greatest part of Spain, after the overthrow of that
unfortunate king Don Rodrigo, there continued in the time of the king Don
Alonso, the sixth of Castile, and Leon, which got Toledo, the Earl Don
Ramon, son to William earl of Burgondie, and Don Ramon Earl of Tolosa and
S. Gill in France, and Don Henry of Vezancon his cousin, according to the
opinion of some writers, as Christian Princes desirous of honor and fame that
came too serve him, with many other knights in those wars that he had
against Lucef Abendesim, king of the Amorabides, who at that time had past from
Africa, and had made him self Lord of the Moors of Spain which were
resident in Andaluzia, and too show him self thankful to these Lords after
they had showed their vali^untnesse and virtue on their meetinges and fightes
that they had with the Almorabides and to bind them to greater enterprises,
and to allure other strange Princes, and knights also to come to his aid,
he joined him self to them in marriage and affinity, Mariyng the Earl Don
Ramon of Burgondie with the Lady Vrraca his legittimate daughter and inheritour
of his Realms, giving him the title of the Earl and Governor of Galizia, and
the Earl of Tolosa, and Don Henry, with the Lady Elvira, and the Lady Tere^,
his bastard daughters which he had of Lady Ximena muuez de Guzma: giving to
Don Henry certain land which the king Don Fernando his father the first king
of Castile, and other kings his predecessors had gotten of the Moors in the
bor^ers of the Realms of Leon and Galizia, which were the Cities of Coimbra,
Viseo, and Lanego, with the Province of Vera, and the Cities of the Port Braga
and Guimareus, and all that precinct which is between the two Rivers Duero and
Mino^ with title of Earl of Portugale, because he should be a defender of
them, making to him a firm gift of the right of the inheritance too him and
too his succession descending of this Matrimony: With condition that they
should be bound in knowledge of Superiority, to go to the Parliaments of
Leon, (into whose precinct that Country does fall) and at all times when the
kings had wars with the ( Moors) that they should be bound to g^e and
serve them with three hundred horsemen, which was at that time all the power
that might be in Portugale: and the they should also pay certain yearly
Tribute upon pain, and that if they failed any thing of this, they should
loofe the state, and that it should be returned back too the kingdom of Leon.

And although that all these burdens were set at liberty by Ann. 1279.
a gift that the king Don Alonso the wise made in Seuil, against the will of
the Earl Don Nunon de Lara and of other knights being Spaniardes, to the
Infant Don Dionis, son to the Lady Beateris, his natural daughter which
^ee had by the Lady Mayor Guillen de Gusman, and of Don Alonso the fifth king
of Portugale, which married with he^ and had in dowry the Countries of Algarve
which the king Don Alonso, and the holy king Don Fernando gate, always the
king Don Dionis and his successors, as Catholic and true. Princes, continue^
the Wars against the Moors of Spain, finding themselves sometimes in the
favor of the kings of Castile, and particularly the king Don Alonso, called
the* Brave, when he gave the battle near to Tarifa, until that the king Don
John the famous, being the first of this name, by the battle of Aliuba^ota, and
by other subtle practise^ worthy of his name* he determined as a most warlike
Prince to pass into Africa, and to co^quer the Towns of the Sea Coast nere
adjoining to him on the West side, carriyng with him in his company the
Infantes Don Edward his (...) son* and heir apparent, and Don Peter Duke of
Coimbra, and Don Henry his other sons, and many other Lords and Knights of
his Realm, where withal he might get the City of Cevta, standing in the
Streighte, where the two Seas do meet, the Ocean and Mediterrane, and where
Africa and Europa are divided, right over against Gibralter in the distaunce
of four leages overthwart.

The second Chapter shows of the diligence that the infant Don Henry did
use as well to know of the Moors, of Cevta, and the Provinces of the black
people of Ialofe, as also for his armed ships which he sent in the discovery
of the coasts of Ginea even unto his death etc.
HE that did best show himself for the getting of Cevta, was Infant Don Henry
with the Knights and Gentlemen of his band. And as he was a Prince (...)
religious, and destrous to augment the Christian faith, with his valiantness:
So he did much endeavor to enquire of the Mores, the Proinces and Nations,
nearest adjoining to them whereof he came to have knowledge, and specially of
the Moors nearest adjoining to the Deserts, which they call Sahara, and of
the Azeneges with the black people of Ialofe, and he did it with the better
will, because he would have his name spread abroad in the world, by so great
an enterprise, so taken in hand, and also by sending ships in the discovery
of the Coaste of Ginea, whereof he had some knowledge by Geographie, to the
which he was affectioned. And so in returning the king his former victories to
Portugal he went to be Resident in Algarue in a small Town of his own to
give order for this Navigations, for the which certain Captains of his did
continue there for certain years, and durst not pass from the Cape Boiador
which lies in twenty seven degrees and a half of height on the North side,
East and West from the gran Canaria, in thirteen Leagues ouerthwarte, and for
to come forth of the sight of the Coaste, which they leave behind them more
then forty Leages into the Sea, in the West course, with a certain point
under that water which does come forth in length of six Leages that by
reason of the Tides that runs there, the water is so moved and in such sort,
that it seems to leap and to seethe, which did put them in great fear,
thinking that they had been shouldes and then it was a new thing for them, and
difficulte that they had so gone from the land for to ^bble it, wherewith all
they returned without hope to pass forward, making some entrance into the
habitations of the Moors that dwelt in the Sea Coaste for to satisfy the
infant.

In one of these voyages they discovered in foul weather which did open unto
the^ from the firm land, the Islands which are called Puerto sancto, and the
Madera, which Islands the infant did command to inhabit, because he was
certified that they were temperate and fruitful, and for that they were not
inhabited with the people that were Barbarous, as the Islands of Canaria wrre.
The which Islands* they had knowledge of, how that they were discovered by a
French knight, called John de Betancur, which had conquered them with the
license of the Tutors of the king Don John the second of Castile, which were
the queen Lady Caterin his mother, and the infant Don Fernando his uncle of
good memory, who came to be king of Aragon, and father of the kings Don
Alonso of Naples, and Don John his brother, which did succeed in that of
Aragon, and Sicilia, and Grand father to the king Don Fernando the Catholic.
These Islands stand in the thirtieth three degrees of height Northeast and
Southwest, from the bar of Lishebron, in one hundred and fifty Leages
trauies, and be distant from the Canaria, at the least 80. Leages North
Northwest, and South Southeast. The Infant caused the discovery of them to be
known to Poope Martin the fifth, who at that time was president in the
Catholic Church, and too other Princes of Christendom: of the which there
was restrainte for certain years, until y^ one Gill Yannes being borne in the
town of Logos would pass y^ cape Boiador, being a fearful thing in the
opinion of Sailors of that time, who was cause from that time forward that
Navigations was continued the longer, and other Captains coming to the River
which is called of Gold, because they brought from thence the first that came
into Portugale, and it stands under the Tropic of Cancer, in the twentieth
three degrees and a half of height and the Cape of Blanco, and Islands of
Arguin stands in twenty where the king Don Alonso, his Cousin did command
after that, to build a forte, and beyond the River which the natural people
of the Country do call Obedec, and the Portugales do call Savage, which does
divide the Countries of the Moors Azeneues, and the Ialofes, even unto the
Capeverdes, which is of the most known places in the West Ocean in the
fifteen degrees of the North side, and to the Weast part of him are within one
hundred Leages of Trauisim, the Islands which are called of Gill Yannez and
threescore Leagues beyond, that is the Great River and eighty beyond that of
Nunno, and in seven degrees and two Terces the mountain Lioa, which was the
last time that any discovery was made in the life of this most Christian
Infant; leaving to the king his Cousin, and to his successors the open way for
the great Nauigations and roades which his subjects have made, and do make by
all the East Countries with great praise and estimation of the Portugale Nation.

The third Chapter of the discovery which was made of the coasts of Ginea in
the time King Don Alonso unto his death, and of the persons that the King Don
John his son sent by the Sea Mediterran, whereby they might bring relation of
the states and trades of India; and of the Embassage he sent to the king of
Aethiopia.
THE Infant being dead, it did seem too the King Don Alonso, that it would
be a let to him if he should understand farther in these discoueries, by
reason he minded to conquer Tanger and Arzila, and other forces that were near
to the Streightes, which with great courage he got of the Moors: and for the
pretense y^ he had of the Realms of Castile, for his Cousin the Lady Jane
daughter to the Queen his sister, the second wife of the king don Henry the 4.
with who^ he minded to marry, he gave the discovery for rent to a subject of
his called John Gomez dwelling in Lisbon, for two thowsande five hundred
Ducates, for five years, with condition that he should be bound to
discover within the said time five hundred Leagues of Coaste, beyond the
mountain Lioa, This man which was so bound* did accomplish his ^ande very
well, discovering all these Coasts which they call the Mina, which stretch in
length in the course of the East and West until they came to the Cape of saint
Catherin that stands in two degrees and a half of height, toward the South
side: so there remains behind discovered, the islands of the Prince, and of
Fernando, and those of Sancto Thome* being under the line Equinoctial.

In this time died the king Don Alonso, and Don John Ann. 148*
the second his son succeeded him, who sent forth a Captain of his called
Diego de Acambina, with a great number of ships to this Conquest, who caused
to be builte the Castle of saint George with consent of the Prince. Caramansa
Lord of that Country. Other Captains of his, discovered the Realms of Congo,
and of Beni, and the rest of the same Coaste, which is to be understood from
the North too the South, until they pass the famous Cape of Buena Esperanca,
being the first, Bartholomew Dias one of the officers of his house. Of some
Ambassadors of these black kniges which they sent to Portugale, and
particularly of those of the king of Beni, the king Don John had knowledge,
that far within the country, there was a mighty Prince, unto whom some of
them gave obedience, and by the manners and tokens that he declared of him, it
seemed that he was a Christian, whereof it came to be agreed upon that he
should be Prester John, of whom then there was knowledge of, and of the trade
and riches of the India, by means of certain religious men Spaniardes that
had been at Jerusalem, and like wise of other that were come into Spain. And
for to certify him self the better of the Trade and Navigations, and Ports of
the India, and of the power of Prester John, and of his religion, of whom he
minded to favor himself, for the trade of the Spicerie, he sent one Peter de
Covillana servant of his house, and also Alonso de Paiba by the way of Italy
that he might bring him a true relation of all* These men went to Naples, and
from thence they embarked them selves for the Rhodes, and from thence to
Alexandria and too Cairo which at that time was a Royal seat of the Soldans
of Egypt, until a few years after, in the year a thousand ^nno. 1516.
five hundred and sixteen. Selim Emperor of the Turks overcame and slew in
a battle near to Damasco, the Sultan, Campson Gaurio, and made himself
Lord of all those Realms, and from thence they went too the City of Adem
which stands at the entry of Sinus Arabicos, which is called the red
Sea, in the part of Arabia Foelix, where they departed, one from another: The
Paiba toward Aethiopia, and the Covillana toward the India, where they
agreed together to return and join themselves again at a certain time in
the City of Cairo.

Covillana did embarke himself in a small ship of the Moors, and came to
Cananor; and from thence to Calicut, and Soa, the most principal Ports of
that Coaste of the India, and having well enfourmed himself to the states,
Traffic, and riches thereof, he returned from thence to the Mine of Zofala*
which is in Aethiopia, above Egypt, in nienteene degrees of the height of the
Southside, between Musambike and the Cape of Buena Esperanca, and from thence
he returned too Aden, and to Cairo, where he understood that, Paiba his
companion died a few days before in that City.

And being ready to depart for Portugale he met with two Jews of that
Realm which went to seek after him, with the king Don John his order, because
that one of them had been in Babylon which are called Bagodad amongst those
small Rivers of the river Euphrates that do run jointly with that of Tiger
into Sinus Persicos, he should refourme him of the Trade and Traffike of the
Island of Armos, which was in the entry of it in twenty and niene degrees of
height of the North side, where he said, that thither came all the Spices and
Riches of the India, with express commandment to Covillana, that if he had
not (...) Prester John, ^ee should not return without knowledge of him, and
that with the other Jew he would send him relation of all that he had
seen, and understood in his voyage the which he did very effectually, and
when he had dispatched him, he returned with the other to Adem, where they
did embarke them selves to return to Ormos* And the things of that Island
being noted, he left him there, that he might return by land with the
Cafilas* which are Carriers that carried Spices from thence to the Cities of
Alexandrie* Damasco in Suria, ^ that he should continue going upon his journey
until he came to Portugale. He returnyng to the red Sea* and went toward
the Court of the Emperor of Aethiopia called by his own people Alexander, of
whom be was received with countenance of great contentinent esteeming much the
embassage because it came from a Christian Prince from the parts of Europe.
And although that with all speed Covillana returned, yet he had not in this
good hay* For that within a few days died the Emperor Alexander; And Nant^
his brother which did succeed him, kept him there by force; wherewithal he
lost the hope to return any more too Portugale* And by the advice and
relation he sent with the Jews, and with others by diverse ways, the king
Don John determined too send some Ships by the Navigations of the (...) of
Buena Esperanca unto the Trade of the Spicerie of the India. Ann. 1492.


And because that in this time which was in the year of one thousand four
hundred nientie and two: they begun too discover the Weast Indias by
Christopher Colo^ being a ^inoues ^orne who was the first that durst take so
valiant an enterprise* in ^ande by the commandment of the Catholic kings
Don Fernando and Lady Elizabe. These kings for the avoiding of differences,
made s^te to the high Bishop Alexander the sixth (who then was President in the
Catholic Church) that it would please him to appoint out and confirm to them
their discoueries. And the Pope being informed, did grant too the kings of
Castile, the conquest of the Indias, Islands and lands, that should be
discovered in the West parts, and to the kings of Portugales that of Africa,
and the Countries of the Cast parts in equal portions: so that it might be
understood the Navigations from one hundred leagues, more too the Westwarde of
the Islands of Cape verde: whereof the king Don John found him self agreeued,
because he gave him no more space or Circuit toward the West. And so it was
granted with the will and consent of the Catholic kings, other three ^undred
and sixty leages more toward the West. The king Don John not understanding
at that time, how hurtful it would be to his successors for the pretense of
the Islands of Mal^cas, and because his life is waxed shorts, it fortuned not
in his time this. Navigations should be begun* but was reserved by a divine
providence for the king Don Emanuel his Cousin that should succeed him in those
Realms.

The fourth Chapter how that the king Don Emanuel, sent by the way of Cape
Buena Esperanca, Don Vasco* de Gama with an embassage to the king of Calicut,
and of the success he had until he returned to Portugal.
AND although that the King Don John had prepared ships for the Nauigatio^ of
the India* When he died, yet y^ king Don John Emanuel, could not see forward
this journey until the 2. year of his reign, with was in the year 1491 when as
he sent, (although that they of his counsel were of contrary opinion, yet
the^ I say he sent Don Vasco de Gama, a knight of his house and other two
captains in three ships with ambassadge unto the king of Calicut, too the
end be might be in league with him and with other kings of the same coast of
India, to obtain of them, that he and his successors might have the trade of
the spicerie granted unto them. Now you shall understand that the said Don
Vasco departed with these ships, leaving the king and his court and al others
very sad, because he went upon a voyage, so long, so dangerous, and so
unknown. And he was five months in the Sea before he could get as far
as the cape of Buena Esperanca by reason in those days the Portugales sailed
not by the Bowlyng in the hye Seas, in such sort as they do now, but always
went near to the coast of Ginea. For although that in the time of the king Don
John, they had knowledge of degrees, and of the Astrolobe: yet the Pilots which
they carried with them, durst not put themselves into any gulf as they now do,
which do run from the time that they depart from Lishebron toward the
southwest, until they pass the Islands of Puerto Sancto and the Medera, and
from thence toward the south southeast to the sight of the Islands of Canaria,
and then south passing between the firm land, and the Islands of Cape Verde,
and South and by East, until they put themselves in the height of the line,
and although that the cape of Buena Esperanca do fall Southeast of them, they
cannot make their way good, by reason that in those Seas are many leuantes
which are Eastsoutheast and Southeast winds, that does cause them to fall
over, near too the coast of Brasil, and therefore they go by the Boweling
running toward the South Southeast, South, and Southwest according as wind
and weather do give them leave: until they put themselves intoo thirty and
six degrees, sometimes in sight of the Islands of Tristan de Acunna, which lie
from the West part of the cape Buena Esperanca, four hundredth and fifty
leages, and at other times they run into forty, and forty five degrees,
until they ^nde Westerly winds, wherewith they return and run toward the
East, and Eastnortheast too seek the cape. When Don Vasco de Gama passed he
ran toward the Northeast along the coast; and because he would put himself
into the Sea, when he came to the cape of the currentes or tides, for fear he
should put himself intoo any baie, or shallow place, and because he would
pass along the coaste with all the van^age he could, he past and had no sight
of the inhabitants of Zofala, between the Island of Saint Lorence and the
firm land, until he came too Moscanbique, which stands in fifteen degrees
of height of the South side, six hundredth leages beyond the cape of Buena
Esperanca, which place is now themoste principal port that the Portugales
have in all those Seas.

Don Vasco tarried a small time in this place because it was then inhabited with
Merchauntes of the sect of Mahoma, which were come thither in the trade of
merchandise, and so he ran along the coaste and touched in Mo^basa and in
Melinde, where he was well received of the king, although he were a Moore,
with whom he concluded a peace and amytie in the name of the king Don Emanuel
his Lord and master. And having well informed and instructed himself of the
coast of the India, he took expert Pilotes for the Navigations, and went
along upon his voyage, passing over a gulf of seven hundredth leages in twenty
and two days until he came too the City of Calicut put in eleven degrees
and a quarter of the North side, with great joy and gladness, too see himself
at the end of his journey. And being at Anchor without, he sent word too the
king of his coming, where he was in a place five leages from the City, who
sent him word that he was very glad of his coming, and of his Embassadge;
and took order that he should pass his ships too the Port of Capocate, a
place most sure, where they might ride at Anchor by reason that it was in the
Month of May, which is in that Country the coldest and hardest time of Winter
in the year, and when he thought good he would advise him to come to the
Court.

This region that commonly is called India, is the Country with in which is
contained the two famous rivers, Indus and Ganges, which do spring in the two
mountains Dalanguer and Nangracot, so being joined one to the other, that they
are thought to be one and the people of that Country do think that they spring
out of one common vain, and so run into the great Ocean Seas. The river
Indus of whom all this Province took the name by the realm of Guacarate which
commonly is called the west part of Cambaya, and the river Ganges by that of
Beugala toward the e^stparts lying East and West, under the tropike of Caucer*
^trauise of threehundreth leages from one mouth to the other, from the which
comes out a point of the land, far in to the Sea, and shows it self very
sharp, even until it come to the cape Camori, which lies Noorth and South,
from the fountains of these rivers in distaunce of 400. leages of length in
seven degrees and two terces of height, of the North side. And although that
amongst the Princes of these Countries are but two differences of laws,
Idolaters and Mahomets, all the Country is divided in to many realms and
states. For although they are very warlyke and of littel fayths: yet the height
and sharpnes of the hills and mountains, and the great number of fearce
bests which are not to be made tame; and the rivers and the entering of the
Seas do make it invincible, and is the cause cause that all this region is not
brought subject to the Prince which is of most power, and principally by reason
of a long tract and row of mountains, which the natural people of the Country
do call Gates stretching from the North to the south, in the length of 200.
leages, from one coast to the other, as does the high mountains Apenino in
Italy beginning at the west part at the river Caruants, and passing unto the
mountain called Delij, very well known of the sailers of that coast, which
stands in xii. degrees and a half in height of the North side; where is a
plain piece of ground overflowed with water of six or ten leages, as it
seems by the bays near adjoining thereunto, which may be eighty leages
long, and the natural people of the Country do call it Malabar, where stands
the realm and City of Calicut: this king being the greatest of power of
those of this province and therefore he is entitled Camori which is as much
too say as Emperor.

Two days after that, Don Vasco had placed his ships in the port of Capacote,
there came for him a servant of the king to bring him too his presence whom
they call their Catual, accompanied with 200. men of his guard, who put him
self into his journey, carrying with him only xii. Portugales and one Moore
called Monzaide* This Monzaide was of the realm of Tunez, who did him great
pleasure, by reason he was a faithful interpreter: of whom he understood the
secrets of the land, and the government thereof: and in the way came to
receive him another Catual of higher degree, who did accompany him until he
came to the king, who when he should receive him, put himself for Majesty at
the end of a great chamber in a bed which they call) Catel appareled with a
certain kind of fine cloth made of cotton wool burnished, and set with roses
of beaten gold, and on his head a long high cap of cloth of gold, of the
fashion of a close mytre, full of pearls; and on his legs and arms he had
great store of bracelets of gold and stone, he had his head lying upon a
Pillowe of plain silk wrought with gold firisied: and there was leaning to
the bed a Gentleman which held a plater of gold in his hands with the leaf
of Betely, with which kind of leaf they use to comfort the stomach. And Don
Vasco entering into the chamber there rose very near unto the king, a man of
great years with white garments, representing great honor, who was his heigh
Priest, being the chief of the religious men of his gentilitie, and took him
by the hand and carried him to the kings presence, who received him with a merry
countenance and with a show of great and severe Majesty without moving
himself more then lifting up his head a little from the Pillowe, and when he
laid down his head again, he made signs to the high Priest that he should
cause him to sit down by the bed side* And having spoken certain general
words with Don Vasco, and received the Letter of Don Emanuel, he said that he
would see it, and would hear him when he was at more leisure, and for that
time he should go to take his rest, commanding a Gentleman to have care too
lodge him and see him well used with good entertaineme^t. The next day Don Vasco
would return to speak with him and declare his embassadge, but the Gentlemen
which kept him company kept him back, declaring to him that the Ambassadors
which came to that Country were accustomed not too go to speak with the king,
but when it pleased his Majesty to call them: but the Moore Monzaide, as one
which knew well the order that was used in these causes, said unto him, that
the most certain order and custom of that Prince and of the other Princes of
those Countries was, too hear no man if they did not first give and present
him with some present, and the more strange the Ambassador was, the longer
time they caused him to tarry, and if he will be dispatched shortly that he
should use that way which he had told him, giving some gift to the Officers
which had most authority, and especially in business of the estate: the
which he forthwith put in practice excusing himself with the King and with
the nobility, that by reason of the uncertainty of the voyage and long
Navigations the thing which he offered too them were not of estimation or valewe
that he wished; but in the end, they were taken as sufficient, and were carried
to the king and he was received with more familiarity and gladness then the
first time, signifying too him that by the Letter of the king Don Emanuel he
had understood the cause of his coming, and there upon he should speak what
he would. Then Don Vasco, began with great discretion and wisdom asking the
liberty, and trade of the spices and the intercourse of the trade of
Mercha^dize from one realm to the other. The king answered with shows of
gladness, that he would dispatch him well and in short time.

And although that this Prince were an Idolater* yet he did suffer in his
Towns too dwell people of the sect of Mahomet, and especially in the ports of
the Sea coaste where came many for the trade of the spicery from Meca and other
ports of Arabia foelix as well from the redd Sea, as from the Sea called Sinus
Persicos, which people were much agreeued at the Embassadge and pretense of Don
Vasco, understanding the hurt and losses which would ensue unto them in their
trades; if that the trade of merchaundise should reremayne established as the
king was purposed and resolved to have it.

Whereupon they made many consultations with order too kill the Portugales and
too sink their ships, but they durst not, gyding it by the most sure way,
giving bribes too the Catual, who was a Gentleman that had the charge of the
Portugales, that with false reasons and deceites the king might be angry and
displeased with them. Yet this Gentleman used the matter so discretely, that
(although that the king was very wise, and understood well the profit that might
follow by this trade, for the dispatch of the merchandise of his realm) he
was persuaded too believe this Catual and too take the Portugales for spies.

And heerevppon the King commanded too call Don Vasco general of the Portugales
too be called before him, and so he asked him many questions; and although
he had satisfied him, of all that was demanded him; yet there was no remedy,
but in fine he counseled him that he should forthwith go aboard his ships,
lest he should receive any hurt of the Moors pretending that they were ready
too make an insurrection against him, and promised that he would send him too
his ships the answer of his Embassadge in a letter too the king Don Emanuel
his lord and master. Wherein he said that the cause wherefore his
Ambassador departed so discontent from his Country, was by reason of the old
controversies that were between the Moors and the Christians, and that he
would receive great contentment with his friendship and with the trade of the
merchaundyse of his realm so that it might not be done with reproach,
considering that he took the Moors for natural people of his Country, and
that ordinarily they came too his ports in the trade of spicery; whereupon
forthwith Don Vasco made sail toward Portugal by the same way that he
went, where he arrived at the end of two years, and a few days after he
departed from Lishebron, being received of the king Don Emanuel with great
honor rewarding him, and his great service.

The V. Chapter shows how the king Don Emanuel did send a great fleet of
ships to the Indias with a knight called Pedraluarez Cabral, and how he
discovered in this voyage the coast of Brasil, and of other armies of ships,
which are sent after until the time he gate Malaca, and had knowledge of the
realm of China.
AND the king Don Emanuel being informed by Don Vasco de Gama, of all things
which happened to him in his voyage, he determined to send too the India
thirteen sails of ships so well furnished and provided both of men and
munition, that if it happened when they should come too the king of Calicut and
to the rest of the Lords of those Countries, that they should be defended from
their ports, that the^ his power and force should be showed, and that
Pedraluarez Cabral, a knight of great wisdom, and valiant should go for
general of the said fleet of ships, who departed from Lishebron the nienth
day of March the year 1500. Too whom there happened between the Islands of
Cape verde such a vehement storm, that one of the ships departed from the
rest of her company, and returned back again, and with the rest he took his
course and sailed far intoo the Sea, because he would fly away from the
calmes which are accustomed too be upon the coast of Ginea, and that he might
with more assurance double the cape of Buena Esperanca, running toward the
Southsouthwest as near as the Eastsoutheast and Southeast winds would give
them leave.

And at the end of one Month running that course, they found themselves so
much to leewarde, by reason of the tides which run toward the Northwest,
that they came to discover an other coast of firm land toward the West: and
according to the judgment of the Pilots, it seemed to them that it might be
distant from the coast of Ginea four hundredth and fifty leags, in ten degrees
toward the Southside, and to put them out of doubt, if it should be any great
Island they ran along by the coast all one day, and finding a place for their
purpose, where they might cast ankor, they caused one boat to be hoysed out
for to discover what land it might be: and immediately did appear unto them
by the River where they were, many naked people, which did differ from those of
Ginea, in color, hair, and faces, and they procured to speak with the^, and
to know what people they were, but they could not, for they retired all to the
mountains, and so the Portingales returned to their ships without any
knowledge, and departed the same night, being forced with a storm which caused
them to depart without order: and sailed along the coast toward the South,
until they came into a Bay, where they harbored them selves, which they named,
Puerto Segnero, and is as much to say, The sure port, or haven, which stands
in seventy Degrees and half of height, and forthwith Pedraluarez commanded
to hoyse out the Boats, and he went a land in them, where he caused service
too be said at the foot of a Tree with great devotion of them all, giving
thanks unto GOD that they had departed from that unknown Country where they
were before. And the Barbarous people of that Province did not maruayle too see
the Portugales, as they of the other Country did: but rather, when they saw
them kneel on their knees in the time of service, they kneled down after the
same manner, making the said show of prayers. At the which sight the said
Pedraluarez, and all the rest of his people marueiled much; and were very glad
to see them offer themselves to receive their doctrine of salvation, if they had
had any to instruct them, and because he could not remain there, nor let to
follow his journey, he dispatched forth with the Captain Gasper de Glemos,
that with his small ship he might return back too Portugale, to give news
to the king Don Emanuel, of the discovery of that Country, which he had named
Sancta Crus, which now is called the Brasill by the name of the Wood that is
brought from thence. And when he had taken in fresh water, and saw the weather
fair, he determined to depart from thence toward the Cape of Buena
Esperanca, and there happened to him in the Goulfe so great storms of wether,
that in his sight, the Sea did swallowe up four of his ships with out the
escaping of any of the people of the same: and with the rest he ran many days
without bearyng any sail, until the sixtienth day of July he found him self
only with six of his ships, a great way beyond the Cape in the Coast of
Zofala, so beaten with weather and spoiled of their Masses, yards Sails, and
Tackles, that they were more likely to return then to pass forth upon their
voyage. But the General being a man of so great courage, did set little by all
these inconveniences, and so they came to Mosambike, where they did repair
them selves of the hurtes which they had received in the torments of wether,
as also they were better received of the king then Don Vasco de Gama, was.

They continued from thence their voyage, touching in Quiloa, where they fell
out with the king, who was a Moore, and that grieved to see any Christians in
that coast. But the king of Melindes, who was their friend received them with
great contentment, confirmyng anew the friendship and the trade that Don Vasco
had agreed upon with him: and from thence they ran at whart over the gulf,
until they came to Calicut. And although they were well received of the king,
yet things did hap in such sort, that Pedraluarez fell out with him, and in
the end there were stain certain Portugales which were a land: and for to
revenge their deaths, he set fire on all the ships that he found in the Port,
shot at the City, and killed many of the people, threw down many houses and
buildinges* and so made sail toward Cochin, which was xxx. leages distant
from that place, lower in y^ course toward the South: where he was well
received of the king, who offered to him all the Spicerie which he had need of
for to lade his ships. Also the king of Cana nor sent him the like word,
because these Princes were enemies to the king of Calicut, who was a greater
Lord than they were, and they did acknowledge unto him superiority. And
because they thought that the trade with the Portugales would be profitable
for them, Pedraluarez did lade his ships of as much as they could carry,
wherewith he returned into Portugale by the same way that he came, which is
different of that as is now used. For that they do return among an infinite
number of Islands of Maldiuia, and those of the seven brethren running to the
South southwest, Southwest, and to the West Southwest, having sight of many
other Islands which are in those Seas. And so they come along toward the Cape
of Buena Esperanca, leaving the Island of Saint Laurence North, of the side of
the land. And when Pedraluarez came to Portugale, the king had sent the
Captain John de Noua a Gallego borne with four ships unto the same trade of
the Spicerie. And from that time forward they continued more and more in the
said Navigations, having always shipyes of war in those Indian Seas against
the Moors of the straight of Mecha, and the rest of the Ports of Arabia, and
against the king of Calicut, who came and made war with him of Cochin, for
the friendship and trade he had with the Portugales, and the Captain Edward
Pacheco showed himself very valiant in his defense, who was left therewith
certain soldiers for that purpose, and Alonso Alburquerque the most valiant
knight, and of most wisdom, of as many of the governors as have gone out of
Portugale to that country. For he being captain general of the ships of
war of that Sea, did conquer the City of Ormos, and many other places as
well of those which are in the Coaste of Arabia as of Persia: and made the king
Zofadin too pay tribute who at that time was Lord of that Realm: and he
burned and destroyed Calicut, and gate of the Moors the City of Goa, which is
now the most principal place that the kings of Portugale have in the India,
which stands more toward the North then Calicut in the same Coast in
fifteen degrees of height* and Malaca stands in that famous point, in two
degrees and a half of the Northside, the which Prolome and the rest of the
ancient Geographers did entitle Aurea Chersonesus, in respect of the Island
Samatra which is near too him, and one chanel does divide them, understanding
that they were joined in one, yeuen as the Morea is with the firm land.

The longest part of this Island lies Northweast and Southeast, and the
Equinoctial Line stands over the midst of it. And there remains behind
toward the Weast near to the Cape Camorie in the same Coaste the Island
called Zeilan, and by Prolome named Taprobana in distaunce of four hundred
leages from the one to the other according to the opinion of Portugale sailers,
and not by situation Geographicall by reason that the course lies East and
West. Between the which there is a great bay which is called the gulf of
Bengala, which is the realm that Ganges does run through al alo^g the coast,
from the cape Canori four hundred and ten leages toward the Northeast unto
the mouth of him, and from them it returns running toward the South unto
the point of Malaca, where Alonso de Alburquerque had knowledge of the Malucas,
and of the rest of the Islands and Realms of that Sea, and particularly of the
great Realm of China, which stands in the same Coaste, beginning his limits
five hundred leages more forward toward the West, and there remaining in the
midst of this precinct, the Realms of Siam, Cambaia Champa and Guachinchina.

The sixth Chapter shows of the description of the land of China, and the
notable Provinces and Realms that are in it contained.
THis great kingdom which the natural people of the country do call Tame;
and they are called Tangis, is a Country which lies most Easterly of all
Asia, those of the India, Malaca Samatra, Sian and Pegu, and the rest of the
Islands and Realms of that Sea, are called China, it is said that in respect
of that Realm of Guachinchina, which is neighbor to it on the West side, and
pays Tribute keeping in all things their laws and customs, and the
greattest part of it is washed over which the Easterly Ocean Seas; begin ning
from the Island Aynan adjoining to Guachinchina, which is in the nienteene
degrees of the Northside, showing it self by the South part in the course of
the East Northeast gathering it self toward the North, unto a point which is
most Easterly that it has, where stands the City of Nimpo which the
Portugales do call Limpo, and from thence it returns toward the Northwest,
and to she North, making a great bay far into the land, and carriyng on high
upon it self, and other Coaste set upon that which stands above; and the
higher Country remaining under the cold clouds of the North where the
Tartars do dwell, with whom they have continual wars.

By the West part it bordereth, as it has been delated, with the Realm of
Guachinchina, and higher toward the North, which the Loas Osioens Maos, and
with the Bramenes which are a multitude of people and very rich of gold and
stones, and especially of Rubies.

These are approved people, valiant, and tall of body, and sometime have war
with the people of China, but it is not ordinary by reason of the great hills
and sharp mountains that is between them.

Then follows forthwith the Patanes and Mogores, whose Realm is very great,
and innumerable of people, and of such as be very warlike, they fight with
Bows and Arrows on horseback, they wear Murrions and other things of
defense.

The chief of that Realm is the great Samarcan, they be the true Massagetas,
by whom it is affirmed that no other Nation have had them in subjection. They
are a tall people well proporcioned, and white for the most part, by reason they
dwell in a cold Country. And from them forwards you turn to meet with the
Tartares, which people are tawnie and not white, from the waste upward they go
naked, they eat* raw flesh, and they anoint them selves with the blood
thereof* because they would make themselves, to be wondered at: And therefore
commonly they have such a filthy smell that when they war against the people
of China, if the wind come of their side, they are discovered by the smell,
they fight on horsbacke with Bows, Arrows, and Spears, as the Massagetas do.
In all this description of the Country which has been spoken of, without
doubt it is as great or greater than Europe. There in are contained xv.
Provinces, that every one of them is greater then the most kingdoms that we
know. They name some of the^ under the name of Metropolitana, where their
Governors and Presidents are resident: they are named, Ca^ton Foquien,
Chequeam, Xanton, Nanquij, Quinquij: these are bordering upon the Sea Coaste,
Quichen, Iunna, Quancij, Sujuam, Fuquam, Canslij Xianxij, Honan and Sancij,
these are in the Country within well near all these Provinces and particularly
those of the Sea Coaste are compassed about with Rivers very deep, large and
Nauigable of the fiesh water, and also replenished with small Rivers and
Brooks which does maintain the Sea, with the entrance of them into it, and
they run fatre within that Country, and because the Country is plain it
semeeth as though it were overflowed, but it is not.

The seventh Chapter shows of the temperature of the Country, and the
notable things that it brings forth.
THe temperature of this Country is diverse: by reason that it does stretch far
from the South to the North, so much that the Islands Ainan do stand in
nientene degrees of height. It is also known that some Provinces do stand in
fifteen degrees, and others much more above, in the borders of the Tartares:
and this is well too be seen by the difference that is of the Inhabitauntes of
Canton, and of the rest of the places of that Coaste, which are base people,
as those that are in Barbary, and do run the race that they do. And the
rest of the people of the Provinces of the land within are white and red, as
in Almanie, although that generally there is not in all of it, extreme heat,
nor cold, because it is shut up within the region which the Geographers do call
temperate, and it stands under the same Climate that Spain, France, and
Italy do stand in* whereby the fruitfulness of it may be understood, that
without all doubt it is the greatest and most abundaunt that is known in the
wide world, by reason that the natural people of the country do procure to
live by their own industry, and continu all labor: not sparing Mountains,
Ualleis, nor Rivers that is not all planted and set with sundry sorts of
Fruits, and with great sowing of Wheat, Barley, Rise and other things
according too the commodity and situation. And it is easy to them, by reason
that they enjoy freely of their own substance; without any molestation of
impositions and tributes. And also they do not suffer nor permit in the
Country any Uacaboundes, nor idle people, nor they suffer any of the natural
people of the Country to go forth of the Realm, there are an infinite number
of people (...) all kind of Arts, and offices. And because they are inclined
to eat and drink well, and too make much of themselves, and to have their
houses very gorgeously dreste, and repaired, they give them selves to labor,
and to procure it, f^eeing from infamy, and shunning little estimation, the
things wherewith idle men are there reproched withal. This realm does bring
forth as great abundance of al kinds of fruits, and garden herbs, as Europe,
and as sweet and with as good taste as those of Spain and better: for in the
sweet Orenges, there is three differences of marvelous taste, and a kind of
plumbes that are well near round which are called Lechias, which are of an
excellent taste, without giving any lothsomnes, and without taking away the
desire of the stomach, and without doing any hurt, although you eat many. Of
the mellons, and of a certain kind of aples, they report wonders, and their
chestnuts they prefer without any comparison to be made of ours with them. They
have great store of sugar, and great store of worms with breed silk, which is
one of the greatest trades y^ is in that realm, and great store of flar to
make linne^ cloth of diverse sorts for their wearing. In y^ dry countries they
sow Wheat and Barley, and in the moist and overflowed grounds they sow
Rise, and they are accustomed to gather it three or four times in the year,
and so it is the most ordinary and common meat they have. The high Countries
which are not good for Wheat, they set and plant with Pine apple trees, in such
sort y^ no ground remains unlabored that is able to give fruit, the rest
of the fields, are most fair to the sight, and sweet by reason of the great
store of Roses, and of other sweet flowers which they bring forth, and it
makes the Orchardes pleasant which stands by small brooks and rivers, and
the gardens and houses of pleasure, which are spread abroad by the said
fields, which they use much for their recreations. There are also certain
bushie mountains and wooddes where does breed great store of wild Pigges,
and also Dear, Hares and Conies, and other diverse kinds of Beasts, of whose
skins they have marvelous plenty of Furs, and especially of the Martirnes
which are many in number of a certain kind of beasts as great as Foxes, they
make the musk whereof they have great abundance they beat them with strokes
until they kill them, and afterward they lay together the skin, the flesh, and
the bones all to beaten, in little hillockes or Molehilles until they be all
rotten, then they cut them, and in this sort they sell them to strangers. The
Portugales do call them Papos, and they take it for better and more fine Musk
then that which they bring from those parts in powder. The most common and
ordinary cattle which they eat are Kine, Hogs Mutton, and Goats, of the
which there are great abundance, in the Mountains and Meddowes. The foul is
so much and specially that which was brought up in great standing waters and
rivers, that they account it a small matter to spend ordinarily every day in
only one of the least Cities of that Realm which is the Canton ten or twelve
thousand duckes not accou^ting any other sort of birds.

The abundance of fish, as well of shell fish, as also of all other sorts of
fish is most great, not only in the Sea caosts but also in the Provinces that
are in the further most part of inland, because the rivers are al great
nauigable or portable by reason of the greatness. Of all kind of drugges there
are great abundaunce and particularly of Rubarbe, and many mines of silver and
gold, of the which is gathered great quantity in the rivers, and likewise of
Copper, Iron and other metales, in such sort that they have great ple^tie of al
things* and lack nothing that is necessary for the common use of the life of
man.

The VIII. Chapter shows of the greatness of the Cities, Temples and buildings
that are in it, and that be in all the Country of China.
THere are in this realm many Cities and very populous, insomuch that in a
Card Geographical made by the said people of China, which was brought into
Portugal to the power of John de Barros a most learned historian of that
Nation, there came marked two hundredth forty four famous Cities, and they
are numbered and noted out with this syllable fu, which is as much to say, as a
city like to Canton fu^ Panquim fu: and the Towns (which are very many in
number) with this syllable che^. The Uillages are innumerable, and of great
husbandry, and some of them are of more the^ three thousand inhabitauntes and
the difference which they have, is that they be not compassed about with
walls as the towns are. All the Cities for the most part are set and planted
by great rivers which are nauigable and compassed about with deep and broad
marrishe grounds which do make them most strong. The walls are made of great
stones the height of a man, and from thence vpwardes of brick made of the same
clay that the earthen dishes that they bring from thence is made of; which is
so strong, that with great difficulty it can be broken with Pikaxkes. In
some Cities they are very heigh and broad, in such sort that there may
march four or six men in a rank or front upon them. They are beawtified
with many Bulwarks and Towers from one side to the other, covered with most
fair and beawtiful coueringes and compassed about with galleries, where their
Gouerners and Ministers are accustomed to go too recreat themselves with the
sight of the fields and Rivers and of other great buildings which from thence
are discovered. And there is a certain space of ground between the walls
and the marrish ground, upon which vi. men on horseback may march: and in the
innermost part of the walls on the other side there is as much more void ground
unto the houses, that they may pass the watch without any imp^ment, the
walls are so whole and without clifte or rift or show thereof, as if they were
but then new made: and yet having in many Cities memory of two thousand
years since that they were made: and the cause thereof is that in every City
and town the king has an Officer with great wages which does not occupy
himself specially in any thing, other than in continual surueying of them,
and to cause them too be renewed. And therefore they have order that he which
is Tresurer and receiver of the Kings rents in such Cities and in the like
places, does give too him all that is necessary and needful for the reparing
of them. This is so precise a matter that the like officers are visited and
chastened if they have not fulfilled all things which they are bound unto in
their office. The entrance of these Cities are sumptuous, and of great show
and Majesty* with three and four gates most strong, and all things too them
aperteyning, of Iron.

The streets are well paued with stone, and stand right without declyning too
one side more then too the other: where you may see from one gate too the other,
and in the most of them may pass in a frunt ten and fifteen men on
horseback one by the other, and yet there remains in one side and the other
great windows, and stawles for the service of them that keep shoppes of
merchaundyse: they be so broad that there is buil^ in them triumphant Arches
of great beawtie and show, whereby the Cities be much detked and adorned:
and the said Arches are set some upon timber and other upon free stone,
which are much painted with gallant shows covered with Tiles, made of the
earth, which the fine white dishes are made of. And by reason the streets are
so broad they make them with three gates and those which are in the midst are
greater the^ those which are at the ends. The Arches are so broad and so far
out intoo the streets and so made that the people are defended from the rain
and the Sun: and under them is sold much fruit and other fine trinckes, and
Iewelles of all sorts.

The houses where the kings Officers are resident in, are sumptuous and of a
strange buildinge, and so broad that some of them have more room the^ is in
a good Town. And the cause thereof is the great gardens and parkes which are
compassed about that is within them, wherein is great store of dear and of
other game of diverse sorts, and all kind of wild foul.

In Towns that are near the Sea coast, all the houses for the most part be
low, and within the land they reise their Chambers alofte; and of fair
buildings. They have generally at their doors trees of beawtie set in a row,
one by an other in order, which are set with equal distance, and by line,
which are green all the year, because they should yield them shadow and also
beawtifie the streets.

There are in that Country some Cities in which the Barks may sail with in
them like as in the town of Brudges in Flanders: in the which river do Barks
pass laden with all kind of vitailes and merchaundise, and the streets stand on
both sides of the Chanelles where they sail and come to the Wharfes and
Bridges of goodly building and specially at the going out of the Cities, for to
pass the fennes and the rivers. When they be so great and deep that none ca^
go over them, they make bridges upon many boats or barks after the fashion of
the bridge of Seuil tied with strong chains, and when the fresh waters are
very great, they undo the^, and then they take barks which they to we with
oars, and do use them to pass the people and al other things they have to
pass at the kings cost, this order is in all the Country, although it be in
places not inhabited.

In the hills and mountains where people commonly do journey, there are made
Cause is that are heighest in the midst ^ausies very ^otable.
and well repaired, which is one of the most notable buildings for common use
that is in all China. The villages are for the most part al compassed about with
trees, which do hyde them because the houses be low, unless it be the
houses of some rich farmers, whose housen are very high and decked with towers,
and which are to be discovered far of, by many parts, because the Country is
much replenished with villages and houses of pleasure, of great recreation,
where they have gardens and parkes of dear and wildfowle, and ponds of fish
of al sorts. And by reason they are blind in Religion and without light of the
knowledge of the true God, and of feeling of everlasting life, they endeavor
the rather to pass the temporal life with great ease and contentment, reposing
their chief felicity in things temporal and in things of most pleasure in
this life.

There are many other buildings of great admiration in those cities, and
specially in the province of Fucheo; and certain Portugals with were carried
prisoners thither, do affirm that they saw a tower before the house of the
kings Tresurer in that Province, built upon 40. whole Arches, and every pillar
of the Arches had in length forty pawnnes, and in compass xii. and the rest
of the building was so sumptuous and fair that therewith they were amazed, and
it seemed too them that in respect of that, al was little which they could see
in all Europe.

And because you may better understand the majesty of this Empire and the
riches and greatness of it, the Portugales do make particular relation of the
City of Canton, which is one of the least of that realm: of the which City
they have most knowledge, by reason of the ordinary trade of shipping that
they have too that place and port with their merchaundise, which in respect of
the rest is as the City of Cadiz in respect of the rest of the great Cities of
Spain: and they say that this City of Canton stands before the Island called
Ainan in the same ooast in twenty seven degrees skarce of height of the North
side in a plain fair field, and delectable to the sight; for the trees and
fruits that it has, and all kind of husbandry being placed among the small
rivers, being branches of a great river which goe^h spreading in breath two
hundredth paces, and in deepth from three to seven fado^, and by the sides of
these rivers are planted many small villages and fair houses of great
pleasure; until you come to the sea which is near unto it. At the entry in
toward the City, are certain Islands inhabited with husbandme^, with only do
live by husbandry* It is compassed about on the part and side where the river
is not with a broad deep diche or trench* whereunto comes great store of
water which makes it strong, and it is nauigable, the walls are built with
stone, lyme, and brick, upon the face of the earth without any foundation*
but filled up full of earth and broad. There are in the walls eighty three
bulwarks. John de Barros does say that they are nientie of a great show, and
compassed about with galleries, which do beawtifie the City very much, it
has in circute twelve thousand three hundredth and fifty paces, besides the
suburbs which are great and much inhabited, the walls are hole and sound,
although that they do affirm that it is one thousand eight hundredth years
they were built by reason of the great care they have too repair them. The
good fashion that the streets have, do cause the City to show very fair, by
reason they are long and straight. And the said City has seven gates, and
they are seen from the one to the other, by reason the streets are so broad,
that ten men on horseback may pass in front one by an other, and there
remains at the one side and the other, shops where they sell merchaundyse and
all kind of vittailes. The said streets are very well paued, high by the
sides, and low by the midst, that the water may avoid away and being so
long they have throughout great number of triumphant Arches made very sumptuous
as before is declared. At the going forth of the gates to go over the marrish
ground, there are Bridges of free stone, very broad where is sold many
things too be eaten, and others.

The houses where the Presideuts are lodged, that do gonerne this Province,
are the kings houses, and are of great Majesty, and do occupy much room with
the courts, and gardens and great houses where the Counselles do sit, and
determine causes, and do provide things for the Government of the rest of
the Cities, and those for the estate of the wars and for the kings rents.

This Province and that of Cansie by reason they be least; and the rest are
provided with one only Gouerner which they call Tutam, and is as much to say
among us as Uiceroy: and for this cause he is Resident in a City called
Doucheo, which is in the borders and precinet of them both. The ordinary and
common houses of this City are in outward show of small beawtie because they
are low, by reason of the heat which is great in that place, but within they
are very beawtiful and goodly to be seen; because they are made as white as
milk in such sort that it seems as if they were set forth with shyning
paper burnished: and the floores of the ground are made of stones four square.

The timber that these houses are made of is smoothe Timber died
very equal and well wrought, died with certain waters which shows as if it
were the color of Damask well near of the color of gold, and it has a
beawtifull show, and in all houses at the entry in at the door, and in the
pauement or court are flowers set, and green things for their recreation, and
a small pond with fish, and a lynen cloth four square according too the
measure of the court or Pauement that is wichin the door wrought al upon as
though they were counting houses, and upon them are set many Idols of their
gentillitie made of clay or of wood more or less very curinus, according too
the ability of every one. In all the other square places, or lodgings they
have things painted and diverse other curiosities. The rooffes of the house^ are
very well built and covered with tyles, made of the same clay that the
Porcelanas are made of, those which receive the wa^ are broad and short, and
those which lie upon and do shut the Canelles are narrow and long. In the
ends toward the streets the tyles are garnished with very fine things and
gallant made of lyme, and they have no need too tyle them Tyle not gathering
filth.
anewe in many years: For the tyles be not brittle as ours are, nor sharp
but smoth that they do not breed any filthy thing.

At the gates they have trees set, which serves them for shadow, and it
beawtifieth the streets. There are in the City many Temples of their
Idolatry, very great and sumptuous; and chiefly one that is in the midst of
the City with many Towers and Pinacles, which do show over all the City. At
one side of the part of the River there is a great Tower hard by the wall,
and thither goes the A Tower.
Presidentes and other Officers too make merry, and to see the City, the
fields and the Rivers. The suburbs that it has are very great by mean of
the trade of the Sea, and by reason that the most part all the strangers and
men of trade and of business do lodge in them.

They have also the streets very broad with some triumphant Arches, as well in
them, as within the City, there be a great number of places for men too lodge
in, and Uittailing houses, where they have meat dressed, whereas is great
plenty of flesh and fish, as well shellfish as other fish, and fruits and
Wynes made with confections of great delicatenes, that it brings great
admiration to note it, and it is all needeful, according too the great trade
of bying and selling that is there. They do affirm that making enquirte of the
things which ordinarily is eaten, euery-day it was found that there was from
five too six thousand ^ogges, and from ten to eleven thousand ducks, besides a
great number of Kyne, and an infinite number of other Byrds and hens and also
Conies and fish, as well shelfishe as other fish, and fruits and frogs, and
also dogs, which they stay and skin or scalde like Pigges, and the base and
poor people do eat them, so as easily they do confess that this City of
Canton is much greater then th^r Lishebron the ^hiefe City of Portugal, which
is esteemed and taken for one of the greatest Cities of Europe.

The IX. Chapter shows of the countenance and apparel of the People, and
their conditions and manners.
ALL the people of the China generally have broad faces, small eyes, plain
noses with very little hair in their beards; and some there are that have
their faces well made and proporcioned, with great eyes, and with their beards
well set: but there are few of these. It is though^ that those comlier sort did
descend of strange people that in old time matched themselves with them, when
they went forth of the realm and were conversant with other people. In Canton
and al other places of that coast, they are tawnie like unto those of Fetz, and
Marruecos, but al within the land are of the color like to the people of
Spain, Italy, and Flanders, white and red and of good growth. The noble people
of the land, and those that serve in the wars, do apparel themselves with
silks of diverse colors, and the poorer sort of people with black, and with
serge, lynen cloth, and cotton wool, died, because they make no woollen
clothes, although they have great store of woolles. They have their coats
made of such fashion as other were in old time, with many pleits, long fawles,
and broad sleeves, and they make them fast upon the left side, and do guard
their said apparel with that that their garments are made of, according to
the degree and ability of every one of them. They that be of the blood Royal,
and also such as be placed in the chief offices at honor and au^toritie,
differ from al other in apparel: for they go al beeset with gold and silver
round about their wastes, and al other Gentlemen do carry their ears garnished
therewith. Their hoses are very well made and stitched, and their Boots and
shoes are made of silk very curious and fine. In the winter season they fur^e
their apparel with furs of beasts, as of Marterns and Sables, and do bring
them ordinarily about their necks. They suffer their hear to grow long,
wherein they have great superstition, saying that they shall be carried thereby
to heaven: and they color it like as women do, and do gather it together in
the highest part of the head with a string, wherein they put through a nail of
silver. Those that are not married are different from them that are: wherefore
they wear their hear curled upon their forehead, and wear on their head
certain high coyues, and round, made of small sticks very fine, and wrought
upon with black silk. The women are commonly very fair, except those that
are dwelling at the Sea coast, of the part that is toward the south, and
those that dwell in the hills and mountains: the rest are very white and
fair in their fashion, and some with goodly eyes, and their noses very slender
and comely. All are appareled with silk, and the poorest sort with serge and
lynen cloth. The coats with they use, be of the fashion of them that are here,
and the Petty coats with broad sleeves. They dress their hear with most
great care, they carry it gathered together on the higher part of the head, fast
bound with a broad lace of silk garnished with stones and pieces of gold.
They paint themselves with the like curiosity as they do in Spain: and they
hold it for a gallant thing, to have their feet very little, and therefore from
the time that they be little children, they bind their feet very much with
clothes, for because that such as have little feet are much esteemed. They
live very closly in there houses, for they are littel seen, their husbands
wills is that they should so do, for they are very iealowse. When they go
forth of their houses, they are carried in chayres with courtines compassed
about, with servants and familier friends that do carry them, and that do
accompany them, in such sort that none are seen by the streets, but people
of low and base degree. The men do buy the women when they marry them, and pay
for them to their fathers, much or littel money, according to their degrees.
And although that it be lawful for the^ to have as many as they can maintain,
yet they dwell with one alone which is the chiefest in reputation, and the rest
they lodge in diverse houses. And if they be men of trade and merchaunts that
are traders, they do place them in such Towns where their business and trade
lies. They do not suffer within the Cities, that any common women should
inhabit, but in the suburbs where is appointed unto them public streets
for their habitation. All these for the most part are slaves bought from the
power of their moothers when they were children, for because it is permitted by
law unto widows that do remain poor, when they have not where withal to
sustein them to sell their children for their relief: being oppressed with
necessities, they go to rich merchaunts and offer their daughters that they
may buy them. The which merchauntes moved with covetousness do teach these young
maids too play of the Uirginalles and Gittorns and other such instruments:
and after growing to ripe years, they put them intoo the streets too reise a
gain of their whoredoms. There is an account taken by an Officer of the
Kings, which is appointed for this cause; unto whom the master of these
maids does pay so much by the year, after the manner of tribute, and they to
their masters every Month as much as they do agree upon: and those which do
play of the Instruments and sing well, be more esteemed and of greater price.
When they are old they make them look young again, with ointments oils,
waters, and with colors, and when they are old and of no more profit, they
remain free without any longer bondage unto their masters, or any else,
mainteyning themselves of that which they have gotten in their youth, with
their naughty trade. And the boys do serve al kind of service in their houses,
until they be of years to marry, and the^ their masters are bound to seek
then wives, and to provide them houses, and to give them trade or order how
they may get their living, and these servants must give their masters every
year so much in knowledge of their bondage, but the children of these slaves
remain free. They do celebrate all their holy days in the night, and
principally at the time of the new Mones, as people that walk in darkness,
with great shows and many inventions, and with much Music. And specially they
do solemnise the first day of the year, which is amongst them at the time of
the new Moon of March: and therefore they trim and deck up their houses and
doors with many carpets and clothes of silk, and of diverse kinds of roses and
flowers planting in all the streets trees most high with their bows cut off,
whereupon they hang many lights, and also of the triumphant Arches which in
these days they deck with bows, paint them, and hang them with clothes of
Damask, and other diverse silks. The Priests do assist in these holy days
being richely appareled, and do offer sacrifises too their Idolles, singing
according too their fashion, and they are al joyful with the music, they sing
very unlike one another in their voices, and diverse kind of instruments like
too Gittorns, Uiolls, and Uioles of the bow, Claricordes and Fluites. And
although they be not of the selfsame making as ours are here, yet they are
much like to the^, and are very curious, and their voices do agree with the
Instruments maruellously, and they make a marvelous accord in the sound.
They have many shows or plays very pleasant of great entertainment for such
as do understand them, they do them very naturally with great preparation; and
very like to the matter, which they do present them for. And all the time that
these festiual days do continewe, they have their tables set full of meat of
diverse sorts, as well of flesh, as of fish, and of al kind of fruits, and
of most rich wynes of marvelous raste, and they and their Priests do nothing
else but eat and drink at discretion until they can not stand: and in that
point neither the Fleminges nor Almans do pass them.

In the principal days or feasts that every one does keep as in the day of
his birth, they do conuite their kinsfolks and friends, and bid one
another, and they send delicates and things too help them make their feasts.
There are great expenses in these bankets, and those which make the^ for their
pastymes, they spend frankely their goods in them, they are served with
marvelous policy, and with strange order, and if there be one hundredth
guestes, every one eats alone, or by two and two, upon littel tables most
gallant, so gilded, and painted with wildefowle, dear, and al other sorts of
birds that they cover no table with clothes, but only compasses the table
with a border or a frontall of Damask in every one that reaches to the
ground, in the ends and sides. Round about the tables they put many little
baskets very curious decked with flowers with diverse different fruits, and in
the midst the meat very orderly, and prepared as well of flesh as fish,
brothes of diverse sorts served in rich dishes made of fine white clay called
Porcelanas, or of silver. They eat very cleanely, for they touch not their
meat with their hands, but with small sticks gilded that they hold between
their fingers, and with forkes of silver: they drink many times, but little in
quantity, and they drink it out of little cups made of the white fine earth
that the Porcelanas are made of, too the end that they would drink very littel
at a time. Women do help to serve in the meat and drink, and too wait at
their tables: and when the tabels are served the said women do the office of
iesters too make them merry and joyful. They have musitions in all these
bankets and players upon diverse Instruments, dauncers and representers of
comedies, wherewith they be recreated as people without care, and without
light of the glory of heaven, not directing too any other end but too the
contentment and felicity of this world, whereof they enjoy the full. The Lords
and the people of estimation are served with much more Majesty and curiosity,
for they give to the^ at every time they change their meat, clean napkins,
knyues, forkes, and spoones. They use great courtesies, and good behavior one
with the other in their quaffing and drinking making much one of an other. And
they are so ielowse, that they suffer not their wives to eat with them in
these feasts and assemblies: but they agree and eat together in some other
place apart from them: and there goes no man into the place where they are but
certain blind men that are musicions to make them merry. They use a certain
courtesy at their meeting very strange, they shut their left hand and cover
it with the right, and hold them up many times upon their breast, in token that
they have them fast shut up in their hearts, and to this mouinge of hands they
add unto words of courtesy. And amongst the common people that which they
commonly speak when they meet any strange friends, that have not seen one
the other many days before is, that they do ask them, if they have eaten?
and if they do answer, they have not, they carry them to the vittailling
houses, and make them great cheer, and do banquet them at their discretion:
For as I have said, in all places and streets, as well within the city as
without, there are a great number of vittailing houses, where they sell meat
and drink aboundauntly of many sorts of meats: and if they say that they
have eaten, they carry them to other houses, where only they are served with
Conserua and fruits and shellfish, and sundry sorts of wynes, wherewithal
they banquet and recreate themselves. And if there come any guests, newly forth
of any other place to their houses, if they find them not with their best
apparel that they use to wear at a festiual time, they speak not unto them,
nor make any reckening of them, until they come in the most rich apparel they
have, and in appareling themselves so, they receive the^ with great mirth and
gladness, and great courtesy. For they have an opinion that it is not lawful,
nor that they are not bonnde too receive any guestes, which wear their common
apparel, but such as do come with their festiual apparel, and the best they
have, too show them that they have caused with their coming, great feasts and
gladness in their houses. They use too make very much of them at their coming,
and their kinsefolk, neighbors and friends come too see them, and carry them
a water made of certain herbs sodden that is somewhat bitter and of a redd
color which is very healthful, and such as they use, ordinarily for too
preserve them in health. All people in general give themselves too labor,
as well in tilling the fieldes' as in other sciences and arts, and in the trade
of merchandise, not permitting any idle men. Neither is there ^o Beggars.
any poor people that do beg among them, nor they give them any alms, for
they will that all get their living with their labor. And therefore they have
this order if there be any that are lame, and criple, or of grievous diseases,
and have of their kindred that are able to sustain them, and do it not, the
chief Tresurer of the king and other Officers in that place do force them too
do it, and so they give them what they have need of, according too the
ability that every one has: and if they have no kinse folks that are of
wealth, then they command to prove the same before their Officers or
Ministers of Justices, that they may command them to be received into
Hospitalles that the king has to this end in every place, with ordinary
Officers that do minister and give to every one what they have need of
abundantly, which cost proceeds of his rents, and for the most part al
these are incurable until they die, they have their names set down in their
rowles and they themselves and the chief Treasurer, and keeper of the
accomptes of the kings rentes do visit the officers and do take account of
the charges and provision of the sick people. And if they find that they have
not done their duties as they are bound too do in serving and cherishing
them, they are chastened without any forgiveness. And for the blind men being
poor, they ordeine that they labor and work, and get their meat in grinding
of wheat and Rise in milles, in place of moyles. And the blind women which are
strompets they appoint other women too govern* trim, and deck them, which
have their sight, and have left this kind of naughty living. They are al very
ingenious and fine of wit too do any thing with their hands and chiefly
they which use too paint pictures; for they are marvelous painters of al kind
of byrds, as it is well seen by the bedde^, tables, windows targets and other
like which they bring from thence to Portingal, and very quick of natural
understanding, and to find out all kind of arts* They have many Co^thes, and
Wagons, carried with horses. They use abroad in Towns and villages Wagons
that are carried under sail with the wind, and they govern them as easily as
barks in the water. I saw many Portingales that did affirm this which had
been in that Country, and it proves to be so, for in some linen clothes are
painted, which they bring from thence that I saw in Lishebron there comes
painted the fashion that they are of. They have such discretion and cunning in
the trade of merchaundyse, that such as ^oo use it, are commonly false liars,
and full of mischief, for they do not endeavor any thing, so much as too
deceive the^ with whom they trade, as people without consciente, and clothed
in deceit. There are many that go ra^ging from Province to Province with their
merchaundyse carrying from one to another, the things which they want, and go
down to the ports of the Sea to sell to strangers of the Islands and Realms
near adjoining too the^. Others there are which live continually in the Cities
and Towns, where they have great lodges in the public streets under those
Arches, and at the gate a table set, wherein they have written all the
merchaundise they have. That which commonly they sell, is cloth of gold and
pieces of silk of diverse sorts, and very curious, whereof are many crimsons,
Damaskes and Taffetas, of so high a price, that the Portingals dare not give
for them that which they are worth, although it be a merchandese that most of
all others they buy to carry to Malaca, and to other parts and realms of that
Sea coast, and to the India, and too Portingal. Their merchauntes of lower
degree* do sell f^e and course ^erge, of all colors and pieces of lynen cloth,
and cotton wool, whereof the poor people do apparel themselves. They which
have simple medycines have their sign set at their doors. Within the land is
great store of Ru^arhe, but it is brought to Canton sudden, and not raw. They
sell the Porcelanas which is the five dishes made of white clay at the gates of
the City, there are of diverse sorts: those which are most fine, are not
commonly sold, nor they are not brought in to these parts: for the gouerners,
and presidents, and Lords are served with them, they are redd, green, gilded,
some yeallowe, they are made of a white soft stone, and some are red, but the
red is not so good, because it is of a more strong and base clay the which
being ground is laid in certain ponds of water which they have made of free
stone, and some* l^ked upon but very clean: and after they have it well wet
and turned two and fro in the water, of the creme or skimme that remains upon
the water they make those which are most fine, and the lower they go, so much
the more course, and of that which remains lowest, they make the grossest or
coursest, whereof the common people are served, and they are fashioned even in
the sort and manner as our earthen dishes are made here, and they dry them in
the son, and after they paint them, as they list, with the ink of Anil
which is fine, as by them you may perceive, and when they are dry they glase
them, and they bake them. In the Province called Saxij are made the best: and
the greatest Fair and sale of them, where they are most sold, is in Liampo,
which is a City of the same Province. The artificers and craftesmen are
dwelling in the open places and streets as they are here. There are
goldesmithes that work upon gold and silver curiously, and marvelous
gilders and grauers of gold which have great shoppes full of counting houses
and painted and garnished Chestes, and many Chayres gilded with gold, and some
with silver of such as they carry their gouerners and other chief Officers of
their common wealths on their shoulders, which are very rich, and of great
price, and specially one sort of them which are made very high, and covered
with windows made with a lattesse of Iuory, that they which are within may see
those that are without, and they not seen. These do serve to carry women when
they pass in the City. They have many rich beds, tables, stools, small
chestes so gilded and curiously wrought and painted with gold, and other
materials, that it is wonderful to our great artificers that we have here. I
^ad in my custody a small counting cheste, and I showed it in Lishebron where
I bought it, and in Seuil unto the most curious men, and of most knowledge in all arts that were in those Cities at that present, and with great admiration
they said to me, that in all Europe was none that would take upon them to
make the like nor understand the work that was in it. There are many
woorkemen of laten which do work an infinite number of al sorts of
vessels, of the which they serve and provide all the Islands of those Seas and
of other vessels of Iron whereof they are great and cunning artificers; and
they melt them according as they melt the latten in Norwey, but it is more like
too glass, for it breaks easily. There are more shoemakers then of any
other science, because it is a thing that is much used and spent. In the City
of Canton there are two great streets of them without any other person of
any other occupation that dwell amongst them, but there are many scatered
abroad in other places of the City. In one of these streets are sold rich
stuff, wherewith they make boots and shoes that are covered without with
silk of coullours with rich stringes, which is made very gallantly. There are
Boots of ten Ducats price; and of a Ducat according to their goodness, and
shoes of two Ducats and so downewarde, unto a maruedie which is the vi. part
of a penny, and are of straw, that the rich and poor may wear every one as
he lists and as their ability serves. In all other arts, there are a great
number of craftesmen very curious and of all things great abundance. And they
are so given too their own profit, that of dogs bones and of other beasts,
they serve themselves therewith in steed of Iuory, and of old rags and
rindes of trees, and of canes they make paper and of small pieces of silk: of
this they serve themselves too write upon, and the rest for too roll pieces
of Damask and Taffetas and other silks in. They buy the dung of the houses
for their grownd in the fields and especially for their garden herbs. They
bring up birds too singe, and they teach them too make visages; they apparel
themselves of diverse fashions. They make all these inventions and many other
too get money, wherewithal too pass their life. The money that is among them is
of copper, but that which most runs amongst them is gold and silver, which
is changed for the valewe in weight, as it is in the Peru. All of them bring
their Ballaunce and broken silver too buy meat, and the rest of the things
which they have need of. And when they buy any thing of great quantity, they
have Balances in their houses, and great waightes made just and marked. They
bring their silver commonly full of dross, too make it increase, which is the
cause that although they have many mines, they carry it as merchaundise from
Iapaon, and much gold out of the Islands called Lechios. These Islands are one
hundredth leages more toward the East from the City of Chincheo which is in
the Province of Foquiem. The first Ila^d stands in xxv. degrees of height,
and there are many other following in the course of the East Northeast, toward
the North; they are all fruiteful, and temperate and of meruellous good waters:
the people that dwell on them are more white then tawnie, and well apparelled
and use armor. They were subject in the old time too the people of China, and
therefore they are much of their manners: but now they are of themselves; and
being in the midst of the Sea, yet they give themselves little too
nauigatio^. Of the fruits that the people of the China do gather and the
merchandise which they trade, in they pay too the King a tribute very easy.
The greatest burden they have, is that they which keep houses by themselves
do pay for every person of their household the valewe of three score maruedies
which is here xi. pence. And with this all their goods and lands are free too
do with them what they list, and too leave them to their children, and
childrens children after their deaths, which is the cause that they labor so
much as they do too increase them.

The tenth Chapter shows of the navigations that the people of China have in
the Seas, and also in the fresh Rivers.
THere are in this Realm an infinite number of Ships and Barks, wherein
they sail by the Islands and coasts of the same, which are large, and by
those great rivers, which do run through many parts of the same, in such sort
as it is thought there do dwell few less people on the water than on the
land, the great store of timber that they have do help them much thereunto,
and the mineralles of iron, and other necessary things for the art of
navigations, by the abundance whereof it is easy to make their Ships and
Barks with very little cost. The greatest ships they have, are called
Iuncos, which are very (...) descrip^ of the se^ all sorts of (...), barks,
(...) galleys.
great, and are made for the wars, with Castles very high in the poope and
prore like to the Ships of Leuant. There are so many of these* that it is
easy for any general of the Sea to join together in little time a navy from
five hundredth to a thousand of them, of the same making and greatness. They
have others for loading, but they are lower of poope and prore. Other smaller
Ships they have, which they call Bancoens, which do carry three great Oars
in every side, with four or six men to every Oar, and such serves them
much, for to go in, and come forth of the barde, havens. And others there are
called Lanteas, that row with seven or eight Oars. These two sorts of small
Ships (although they be for lading) yet the Pirates and thieves use them,
for there are many in all these coasts, and Islands, by reason they sail well.
Also they use other small ships, that are long like to Galleys, wherein they
lade great store of merchandise, to carry up and down by the rivers within the
land: these draw little water after the fashion of Flanders Hoyes. There are
an other sort of small Ships and Barks, different to these, and such great
numbers be of them that is wonderful, but the relation thereof is known
notoriously, and all serves to carry merchandise from one place to another
within the said realm, because it is forbidden that any man shall go forth
of it for any foreign place, although that in old time they sailed much
abroad, and conquering the Islands and Realms of that Sea, until they came
to the India, and at this day there is memory of them in the coast of
Coromandell, which is over against the Realm of Narsinga, on the side of the
Sea of Bengala, where Saint Thomas built his house, where by report remaynes to
this day the relics of his body.

There is a great Temple of Idolles, which serves for a mark to such as do
sail in that Sea coast, which is low The coast of China is low like as Flaun
ders coast is. Shouldes an^ flats perilous to strange fleetes.
as Holland is, and is called the coast of the Chinas, because the people of
Chinas built it in times past. And in the realm of Calicut be trees of fruit,
which have been there of long time, and the natural borne people of the
Country ^o say, that their Nation planted them. And in the Shouldes of Chiloa,
which does extend unto the Island of Ceilam toward the west part of
Coroma^del, it is affirmed by those of the land, that there was lost a great
fleet of their Ships which came upon the India* by mean they were not
perfect in the navigations of those Seas. And it is also said that they were
Lords of Laoa, and of the Realms of Malaca, Sia^, and Chapaa, as commonly it
is affirmed. And it seems to be so, by reason that all the people of these
Realms are in manners and conditions like to those of the China. But in this
point as it seems they had more wisdom then the Greeks, Oarthaginenses, and
Romans, the which for to conquer other strange Countries far off, went so
far from their own, that they came to lose their own Countries at home. And
considering this, they would not so experiment their harms and hurts any
longer: but seeing how the India did consume them much people, and also great
riches of their own Realm, and that they were much troubled and tired of
their neighbors, at such time as they went abroad conquering other kings
lands, and having in their own Country gold, silver, and all other metal,
and much natural riches of their own Country, and such great store of
merchandise, that all other foreign nations did profit by, and themselves not
profit of the benefits of any other Country. All the governors of these
Provinces, determined to consult hereabout, A pollitike ^aw that pur^haseth
insi^ute benesites.
and to be humble suitors to their own king, which at that time wast, o yield
a remedy in this case. Who did establish by law, and at this day it is kept
very precisely, that no subject of his should sail forth of his Realm upon
pain of his life: and that neither by Sea nor land, no stranger should come
to his land, without the express license of the governors of the Country
where they ariue. With this order and manner the Portingales which go thither
do now trade. And when the natural people of the Country will go from one
Province to another, they give sureties to return within a certain time which
is appointed them. And they suffer them not to carry with them any ships
above the burden of one hundredth tonnes, or one hundredth and fifty, because
they should not go far of. And to the end the ships of the realm, and
other strange ships that come thither in the trade of merchandise, may go safe
and come safe; for that purpose the king has great ships armed and warlike,
which The kings navy to clear the coasts from enemies and pirots.
run by all these coasts and Islands, to seek out thieves and pirots, and
within the Rivers they have for this purpose many small armed ships very good
of sail: and especially those that run by the Province of Cansi, which
stands right over against the Laos, and the Bramenez their enemies, and also
by other provinces where need is, for to assure in safety such as are traders
with their goods and marchandizes. And because they may have good dispatch in
the ports, they have established by law of the realm, that the first ship

also they use a kind of Bitumen or pitch, which they learned of them, which
they call the pitch that is made of lime and oil of fish, and common sort of
pitch, made very small and so incorporate, which is put between the sides of
the ships, and an other new lining of boordes, that is made upon the old,

turn to cover the new living with the said new kind of pitch, which is This

worm, and within short time it is made so hard with the water as a stone. And
with this the ships of China endure a long time, in such sort that they have
put to some of their ships called Iuncos, the same kind of pitch four or
five times, that their side is as hard as a wall, but they remain with this
kind of fortification very heavy to go with Disco^moditie of the pitch.

are innumerable, and it is to the Barkemen an inheritante and continual
habitation. They carry in them their wives and children in one side of them,
coueved like a house, and in the other side they have made a place for the ease
of their passengers. And as the Rivers are very great, and broad, and
nauigable, there are in them continually many Barks, like to vittayling
houses* where is to be had meat and drink very delicious: and there are like
wise to be sold all five sorts of merchandise that are to be found in the
great Cities. Also there are many poor people of the villages which are
sitting at the Rivers sides, they dwell also in Barks in the water, without
having any other place to go unto, the men their wives and children, they
bring their couerings for to defend them from the rain and from the Sun,
and they breed in them hens, Geese, Pigeons, They breed ^oultrie and ^oule

some garden herbs. These get their living in going to work in the Country in
the small villages at all kind of work. And the women they pass over by Bark

where withal they catch shell fish, for to sustain themselves. In other
greater Barks goes people of wealth, and some Barks do apperteine to rich

although there are diverse Barks together, they know to which Bark they

after what sort they raise and breed such great multitudes of Duckes and water

in the Summer time they put two or three thousand eggs into dung, and with
continual warmth, and gentle heat thereof and with the time, there comes
forth this brood, as the Chickens do in grand Cairo in Egypt: and in the
Winter they make a great hearth, upon the which they put a great number of
eggs, and underneath they make a soft, mtid^, and gentle fire, and so it
continues in one sort for certain days, until these broodes come forth:
and this is the cause that there are such multitudes of them. The Barks of
these fishers, as well in the Sea as in the Rivers, are innumerable, for the
which cause it is manifest, that it is the best provided Country of fish that
is in the whole world For as I have said, although it be 500. leagues within
the land, they eat every day fresh fish of the Sea. And for because this
should not seem incredible, I will refer me to the The politik increase a^

order that they have therefore every year in the month of February and March,
and part of April, when the great Freshes do come. The fish of the Sea do come
to cast their spawne, or eggs, at the going forth of the Rivers, which is the
cause that there does breed great store of small fish in the creekes thereof,
to which places all the fishermen do come that dwell along the coast, with
their Barks and nets with them, they fish of this fish, and they cast them
into certain pondes, which they make in the water after the manner of a round
circle, upon great rods and course nets, where they live and are sustained
until the fishing be done, which dureth certain days. In this time there
they use too come down a great multitude of Barks of all the Provinces of the
China, of the innermost part of the land, in the which Barks they bring many
Baskets made of twigges, and lined with Paper laid upon with Oil, that the
water may not come forth, and every one of these do buy the Fish that they
have need of, according to the Baskettes that they do bring, and forth with
they return again into the land, moving them every day into other water,
for too sell them where best they may be paid for them. And al men that are of
ability do buy of these baskets for the storing of their pondes, which they
have at their houses, and places of their inheritances. And they are made to
grow and increase in short time with the dung of Kine. And in all the ditches
of the Cities there is cast in, and do breed after this sort great quantity,
the which the governors and officers of the King do enjoy: whereby is
understood the marvelous industry which they use for to enjoy the great
abundance thereof. And the king has for these fishings in all the cities which
are built upon the Rivers sides, ^acrowes to (...) fish with.
many sea Ravens, or Cormorants put into cubbes, where they breed and
multiply: with the which Cormorantes there is made a great fishing. And the
Barks that are appointed for this fishing do come together, and are put in
compass in the midst of the River, and they do bind fast the gorges or
mawes of these birds, because the fish should not discende down to the
guts, and they cast them out to fish, and to swallow down until they fill
their mawes of small fishes, and if they meet with any great one, they take
him out of his bill, wherewith all they return into the Bark to cast out all
he has taken. After this sort they continue their fishing until they have
what they will, and then they unloose them, and do return them to their places,
that they may fill themselves at their own will, and so they put them into
their cubbes as before. Some part of these fishes the king does give to his
officers, and the rest is distributed for the provision of the Cities for to
increase his revenues. The Barks wherein the governors and the officers do
sail in, have their couerings high, and their cabans very well wrought, and
gilded both without and within, with their windows, and casementes adorned
with fine shows. And the Barks of the officers of lower degree, are well
near built after the same manner, and with as much gallantnesse. There are so
many Barks of the one sort and of the other, that they say commonly that their
King may make a bridge upon Barks, Astraung^ thing wor^ the noting
that will reach from China to Malaca, which is five hundredth leages distant.

The xi. Chapter, shows of the letters, ciphers, and figures of the people of
China, and of their studyes in general.
THe people of China have no^ number of letters in their A B C, for all that
they write is by figures, signifying the heaven which they call Guant, by one
only figure which is this. And the king which they call Bontai, which is this.
And in like order the earth, the Sea, and the rest of the Elaments, and names,
using more than five thousand ciphers or figures, different one from the
other, which they make very readily. I saw a China do it, and I requested him
to write certain names, and he showed to me the numbers that they do account
withal, and they were easy to understand, and to sum and rest any manner of
account by Arithmetike by them as well as by those of our ciphers: they make
the lines throughout both above and beneath, very equal and which great order,
beginning contrary to us. After the self same order they have in their
impression which they used many years before it was used in Europe. Of their
printed books which does treat of their Histories, there were two of those
books in the power of the most excellent Queen of Portugale, the Lady
Katherine that now lives. And that which seems most to be marueyled at, is,
that they speaking different languages in the most part of their Provinces, and
the one understand not the other by speech, more than the Gascoines do
understand the Valencianos, yet generally they understand one another by
writing, for one manner of figure or cipher does serve every one of them, and
to signify to them any manner ^traunge ef^ct in their riting.
of name. And although they declare one to another of them any word that is
strange, yet they understand that it is the self same thing, because they
see plainly that it does signify a City which is this, and some do call it
Leombi, and others Fu, the one and the other do understand that it is to be
un* derstoode a City, and the like follows in all other names. And in this
sort they talk one with another in writing, those of Lapaon, and Islands of
the Lechios, and the Realm of Guachinchina, without understanding any word
the one with another when they speak. In all Cities the king has general
^ree schools.
Schools at his own cost, and to them do come an infinite number of Scholars
to be taught. A Friar named Gaspar de la Cruz, being a religious man of
Portingale, of the order of Saint Dominicke, that was in that Country in the
City of Canton, and that wrote plentifully the things he saw, and that which
happened to him in the voyage, says, that they teach in these their Schools
only the laws of the The laws ^aught in Schools. Astronomers
Realm and no other science. But there be some learned men that have
knowledge of the course of the heavens, whereby they know the Eclipses of the
Sun and of the Moon, and these teach to particular parsones, of their own
free will. And John de Barros does say, that beside the teaching of their own
laws, they also teach natural Philosophy, and that they be great
Astrologers, which he knows by relation of others, and by a book they
brought him from thence of the situation of the Country, with a Commentary
upon the same after the manner of an Itinerary, with a Map or A not able ^all.

made of one wall, which begins from the City of Ocoioy, and stands
between two very high mountains, even like unto a way, passage or gate that
passes through that whole Region, which does run from forty three to forty
flue degrees from the West to the East, and until it meet with another great
hill which runs out into the Easterly Seas, after the manner of a head land,
or Cape, and seems to be in length more then two hundredth leagues, which the
kings in times past did command too build, for to defend the incursions of
the Tartares from his Country, their ancient mortal enemies. And all those
Mountains, Rivers, Cities, and Towns, with their names, which Card or Map
did answer well to the book, after the manner as they use there, is after
three sorts, that is by stature, league, and journey, and we use the like.
And the first and least distance they call Lij, which have so much space as in
a plain ground, and a calm day the voice of a man may be heard, and ten of
these Li^s do make one Pu, which do answer little more then a leage of ours
of Spain, and ten Pues do make a days journey, which they call Ichan. And it
is not to be marueyled that they do not situate the distance of the land with
degrees answering too the celestial Orb, seeing that at the time of Ptolome it
was not used of the Geographers, notwithstanding that he says they have this
use in their Oroscopos when they use their Astrology.

The king does send to these Scholars every year visitors Visitours of
Schools.
to examine the students, to see and understand if they profit in learning.
And those which are able and learn well, they honor with words of
commendation, and do animate them that they go forward in their study,
offering them to increase their livings: and those which do not profit in
learning, they command to be put into Prison, and they whip them: and when
they are altogether unprofitable, they dispatch them away every three years.
The visitors use this kind of examination, when they come to take residence of
the Judges, and the Kings Officers: and they bring power and authority to
graduate such as are able men, and of sufficient knowledge in the law, which
is to make them sufficient for to serve the king in Offec^s and gouernements,
as it is more at large declared in an other Chapter following.

The xii. Chapter shows how that of all this great Realm of China one only
Prince is King and Lord: and of his Council and Majesty, of his house, and
Court.
ALL this great Realm is subject to one only king and monarche which does
govern and reign in it. And there does succeed in the Realm from fathers to
sons, and for lack of them it goes to the next in kindred: but, as they
marry many wives, according to the manner of the Turkish Emperors, very
seldom times they lack successors. The first child that is born of any of
his diverse wives is of force inheritor of the Realm: and to the rest of the
children after they are married, there is appointed to them Cities, wherein they
shall live privately, where they are provided of all things that are needful
for them, according to their degrees, with express commandment that they go
not forth of them, nor evermore after to come at the Court, upon pain of loss
of their lives. And when in old time the kings married their sons, they made
a solemn banquet unto all the knights and principal Lords of his Court, and
did command to carry with them their sons and daughters richly apparaled,
and trimmed; and in this congregation came the Princes, where all the Ladies
were joined in company, and there they choose for their wives such as to them
seemed best and fairest, and the young women did the like of the young men, but
now they marie themselves with those of their own kindred. This same self
rigor that is used of shetting them up, all the rest of the kings kindred do
suffer the like, being resident for the most part in the City of Cansi, with
commandment that some do never go forth of their houses too avoid all manner
of occasion and suspicion, of alteration.

The dwelling houses where these Princes dwell are very Ample houses with
Princely pleasures.
great, for within them they have all the pleasure and contentme^t that is to
be thought, as well of Gardens, Orchards, Pondes of fish of diverse sorts, as
also of Parks, where they have diverse kind of dear and foul, such as may be
had in Mountains and Rivers, all compassed about with walls, which makes
more compass than a great town. And as they understand in nothing else but in
making much of them selves: they are commonly fat, of good conditions,
peaceable, and liberal with strangers. They give themselves much to Music,
wherewithal they pass the time, and in other quiet exercises. The governors
and the kings officers are bound to visit them in all their festival days,
and if they ride along by their doors on horse back, they alight down, and
if they be carried in Chaires they descend down also, and they pass by making
little noise, as men that make no show of their authority, nor ordinary pomp
as they are accustomed to do. And for this cause they have their gates of
these houses painted with red oker, because they shall be known. There is not
in all this Realm any Lord that has subjects, or iuristdiction, or other
title, than of an Off^eer, which is the most honorable title they have, and it
does signify in their language, as much as if we in our language should say
Lord and knight. It is gotten by study, and sufficiency in the laws of the
Realm, and by worthiness in the field, and by particular service made too the
king, or to the common Painted gates.

are extolled according to the deserts that every one do* until they come to
be Presidents and governors of the Provinces, and* general Captains in the
Sea* and in the land: and they are occupied also in other offices of the house
and Court of this Prince, and to be of the kings council, which is the highest
office that is. Those which they make sufficient in learning, they choose in
this manner. The king does send every three years a Chaen, which is as one
should say a Judge of residence to every Province, that he may visit the
governors and officers thereof. And this visitation being ended, he does
command that in the chief City there be joined the most learned students of
the most Cities of that jurisdiction, and with the most learned lawiers, and of
most authority, they are all examined, and such as Graduating.
they find sufficient, they do graduate with much solemnity, and with great
ceremonies, making themselves merry in these feasts certain days with much
music, daunces, Comedies and banquets: where withal he sends them to the
Court, that they may receive the signs of men of law, which are certain
Coyfes with ears, and also hat^es, and broad and long gyrdles, and there they
remain until their letters patients of their Offices be given them. And such
as Choice of the Captains.
are made for the wars, first they choose the Captains general, exalting
the valtauntest soldiers with honorable and profitable rooms: for they do
not let to esteem all such as do valiantly, and to reward them with great
liberality, increasing their gifts according to their deserts. The rest of
the Offices are given by the king himsefe, but these rise no higher in degree,
but to have this title of Captain general, for to enjoy many liberties,
freedoms and gain, which is an ordinary thing to such.

This Prince seldom or never goes forth of his Palace, for the conservation
of his greatness, and the authority of his estate, but when he goes to the

with his Court. And he has within the compass of his house all the pleasures
and pastimes that may be devised for the content of mankind, and the
lodginges of his sons and kinsfolks are so great, as it is before said,
whereof the Majesty and greatness of his house may be imagined. And that it
is not to be marueyled that it is so great, as some do say the City of
Paquin is, where he is resident for the most part, by reason of the great
wars he has with the Tartarres, that in one day from Sun to Sun, a man
cannot ride Between and gate (...) than a d^ journey (...) horsebac^
from one gate to another. And besides his Palace, the houses are very great
which apperteine to those of his Counsel, and the rest of his governors and
captains, and of many other men of law, that are always resident in the
Court. The same is said by the City of Manquin, where in old time the kings
were accustomed to dwell and have their Court, by reason it was set in a
fruitful soil, fresh and calm. And in remembrance that he has been
continually resident there, they have in that City in the house of the
treasurer of the kings rentes in that Province a table of Gold, A table o^
gold.
wherein is written the name of the king that then reigned, covered with a
rich Curteine, and they go to it and reverence it, as though it were the king
himself. And so all the Officers and Lawyers, and chief Governors are bound
to draw the Curteine aside in all festival days, that is, in the time of the
new Moons, which amongst them is the first day of the Month. And in the
rest of the Provinces, there are other Tables like to this, but they go not to
them to make any reverence, but when they do discover them: whereby you may
vnderstand^ the veneration that they give The kings title.
to their prince. And they give him title of the Lord of the world, and the
Son of heaven. The servants and such as serve in his house are gelded men,
by reason of the number of wives they have, and so are the most part of his
chief Counsel because that with more assurance they may go in to him, and
consult with him in the business of the government of his Realm, and estate
of his wars: and no others do speak with him but those. His Realm is so
large and long, that for to go by iourneys from the City of Canton, An argu^
of a larg^ dominion.
to his Court, is four or five months journey: and yet there are other
Cities further. He has knowledge every Month, and relation of all things
that do happen in every Province, as well touching the state, wars, and
rentes, as of al other successes, with ordinary posts that the Governors do
dispatch to him for this effect. The same order of the post is as we have
among us. Barros does write, that they run with collers of Belles, and others
that have been in that Country say, they use to blow with a horn to ask
horses, and to give knowledge to Barks to pass Rivers. The Ambassadors of
Princes being his friends or enemies, are received with great veneration:
they lodge them, and provide them of all things needful with great liberality:
and when they come where the king is, all the Lords and knights of the Court go
forth to receive them, and they give them great gifts and presents, and honor
them with the title of Lawiers. Some kings being far of from him, as the king
of Aua, Siam, Melitij, Bacham, Chabam, Varagu, which fell to the north parts
of Pegu, and do acknowledge him obedience, in remembrance that in old time
they were his subjects, they send him ordinarily their Ambassadors with some
present, and for the great journey they have to this kings Court, they always
send with the embassage four or five persons, every one with like authority,
that if it hap some of them to die in the way, or until they be dispatched
from thence: and if they die not of any disease, they always poison one or
two of the^ in some banquet, unto whom they make very sumptuous Sepulchers,
with Epitaphs containing what they were, and the cause of their coming, and by
what prince they were sent: and this is for to continue the memory and
greatness of the renown of his Realm. The Ambassadors of the rest of the
Princes are so priueleged in such sort, that those of his counsel having
condemned too death one Bartholomew Perez, and all the rest of his company
that was sent to this country, by the governor of the India as Ambassador of
the king Don Emanuel of Portingal, surmising that their embassage was false,
and that they were spies, by reason of a certain relation given against them
by the ambassadors of the king of Malaca, and the king himself understanding of
the matter, did command, that their Embassage being false or true, it was
sufficient that there should be no hurt done to their persons, seeing they
were entered within the realm with the title of Ambassadors. Other there are
that come for some commonweals, which are Lords that do owe obedience to
him: they make no enterteynment to such, but use them with a strange kind of
Ceremony. When they say to them that they shall go to see the king, they
appoint them the day and hour, and they cause them to go on foot, or on
horseback, with bridles of straw for humility. And in coming too a great
place that is before the kings house, they stay until there come unto them an
Officer of the kings, who does the office of the master of Ceremonies, and do
command them to pass forward. And at a certain place they kneel down,
and hold up both their hands together, as though they prayed to God, and they
behold one quarter part of the houses of the kings palace, where they tell them
that the king is, and at times in equal space, they make other five times
their prayers, and without turning their shoulders, they return backewarde
with the like Ceremonies: and this being done, they send them away. This say
they, is to go to see the king. If they give them license to say what they
will, they remain in the last prayers on their knees, until there come to
them an other officer which is the Secretary that writes down all that they
ask, and with saying to them that they will consult of it with the Lord of the
world, they are sent away for that time, until they be dispatched with the
determination and opinion of his chief Counsel.

The XIII. Chapter shows of the Presidentes and Officers, which are in every
Province, and the order which they have in the Government of them.
THE King does provide Officers for the Government of every Province, besides
ordinary Judges, which are in some province more the^ three (...). officers
province.
thousand; as also five Presidents; and every one of them has his
jurisdiction by himself, of diverse causes: the chief of them is called the
Tutan, which is a Uiceroy or gouerner of all the Province, unto whom they come
generally with the knowledge of al great griefs and small offenses. And all the
penalties thereof, the ordinary charges being taken away, he sends to the
court, and with the relation of all the news that does happen every month.
His aurtoritie and majesty is so great, that he is not resident where the rest
of the Lawyers are, because he will not be visited and frequented of them. The
second in dignity is the Ponchasi, which is as much too say, as the chief
gatherer of the kings rents, and President of the Counsel of the kings
revenues. This office executes he without the cou^ sell of any Lawyers. There
are many other officers that do serve to recover the kings rentes with the
which they come to the Tutan as before said, and it is at his charge too
command too pay al men's wages, ordinary and extraordinary charges, and to
take account of them, as head Gouerner of al inferior Officers. The third in
dignity is the Anchasi, which is the President of the civil and criminal
Justice who does see and determine withal his hearers and Officers all wightes
and buzines, which go in degree of appellation to his tribunal from the rest
of the ordinary Judges of that Province, and all other things which are
convenient for the good government and expedition of justice. The fourth is the
Aytao, who is the purueiour general, and President of the Counsel of wars,
too whom does aperteine the living of men and providing of ships, vittailes,
and munitions for the ships of war, that go to the Sea, and for arms by
land and for ordinary garrisons of the cities and frontier Towns, and to know
what strangers do come, and from whence they come and what they will. The fifth
is the Luytisi, which is the Captain general that does put in execution that
which is ordained by the Aytao and those of his council. And when there is
given occasion of any wars of importance with any mighty Prince, then goes
this President in person too rule or govern in them. Al these Officers are of
great authority, and such as are officers under them, are well taken and of
great estimation. Every one of them, except the Luytisi, have ten hearers or
Judges in his council, which do assist him, ordinarily for the dispatching of
his buzines, which are men of great authority and estimation: and when they be
in counsel, five of them do sit of the right side of the President, and five
of the left. Those that sit on the right side be of more pre-eminence then the
other five, in that they wear girdelles of gold, and yellow hattes: and they
of the left side, do wear gyrdelles of silver, and their hattes are blewe.
And it is not permitted that any other Judges of the Law wear these gyrdelles
of gold and silver and hattes of these colors, unless they be such as are
Capteynes or other officers of the men of war. And if by chance the
President dye, there does succeed in his place the most ancient Judge next
too him. And when there is any need to go to visit the Province, there goes
one of them with the authority that every one of them have too put order in
the thing that is convenient to be reformed. These Presidents and the other
Judges do bring in their shoulders and breasts the kings arms, and they are a
certain kind of serpents woeuen with thread of gold. They have many other
inferior officers: and although they be but Lawyers they always speak too
them kneeling on their knees, except only the head keeper of the prisons which
is an office amongst them of much estimation. This man when he comes in
kneeleth down, and ryseth up again when he speaks to the^. And when these
Judges come newly too the provinces, there go forth to receive them all the men
of the war with many banners and other souldierlyke shows, and all the rest
of the Lawyears and officers with great mirth and joy. They have on these days
all the streets very much decked with diverse sorts of silks, and with bows
and branches and with diverse sorts of flowers of most sweet smell, and they
accompany them unto the streets where they must lodge with much music and
diverse sorts of instruments, Likewise the king does command to provide with
the opinion of al his counsel all the rest of the ordinary Officers of the
Cities and Towns of his Realm, with consideration that they be not of the
said Country whether they shall go to minister Justice, that they be not
moved by affection too do what they ought not, nor behave themselves with
insolency, nor yet that they be not made mighty, with the authority in
commanding, in such sort that they may cause some insurrection and
alteration. This Lawyers nor the rest of the officers that are appointed too
them, of these supreme offices, do make any manner of preparation when they
depart from the Court too the place of their gouermentes, but only of apparel
and a few servants that serves them, for in all places where they shall pass
through, the King has at his cost, houses appointed and officers, that shall
lodge and serve them with all things necessary, and do provide for them
Horses, and barks if they have need of them. And for their meat it is
appointed what shall be given to every one of the^, according to his degree and
office. And this liberality they use with all the rest of the Lawyers, generally
although they go not provided of offices. At such time as they come, they ask
them if they will have their stipende that is appointed for them, in meat or
money: if they will have it in meat, they serve them very daintily, as too men
that have authority to command too whippe those Officers if they do not
their duties. And when they will lodge in the house of some of their
acquaintance or friends because they will be at more liberty too be merry,
then they give them that portion as is appointed too them in money. Al these
houses are very well provided for, by such as have the charge of them: it
touches the Ponchasi of the Province, for that he must take account of such
as are officers, of the expenses that is made of all these vittailing and
lodging houses. In all these houses they lodge all the ordinary officers that
they may exercise their Offices, as Notaries, serieants, porters, even unto the
executours of Justice, unto whom the king does give meat and wages
sufficiently and are paid every Month, because they should not carry nor
take any bribes of any person. And for this they have an order that none of
these Lawyers can provide or command any thing in Justice, but that it must
pass before al these officers, and in public audience which is done in this
manner. The Judge is set down in his tribunal, and at the entery in of the hal
stand the porters which declare with loud voice the persons name that comes
in to ask justice, and what he demands: who falls down on his knees a
good way from the Judge, and does propou^d with a loud voice his cause, or
tells them by writing what he would have. And this petition one of the
Notaries does take and read with alowd voice: and being seen and heard, he
does provide and command Justice to be done thereupon, and does sign it
with his own hand with red Ink, and if he do not so, then he does remit too
an other inferior Judge that he may do it. This manner of order is kept so
precisly that by no means they can be brybed, unless the officers should
understand it, and as they shall be by them absolved or condemned in their
residences they fear them, all these are very presise too execute that which
they are commanded as well Notaries as Serieantes and the rest. And if any of
the^ do make any fault in their office, eue^ at the very hour there is put in
their hands a littel banner, and so do hold it in their hands kneeling until
all buzines at that audience be dispatched and concluded. And forthwith the
Lawyer does command the executioner that he give him as many whips as too him
seems good, which are such as hereafter shall be declared: in such sorce
that all those Officers go always for the most part with plasters and
marks, and this is so ordinary among them, that they take it for no shame too
go in that sort: When one of these Judges do walk in the City, he goes
accompanied with these ministers. Officers, and other people among them* and
there goes before him eight Officers by both sides of the streets: the two
foremost go with maces of silver made as ours are, put into certain long
staves, and they signify that these Judges and Lawyers are in their office in
place of the King: the other two that follow, do carry two long canes in
their hands on high; which do represent the true and rightful justice they
ought too do: and the other two that follow after these do carry other two
canes, haling them upon the ground, and knit to them certain long red
gyrdles, and in the point of them certain tasselles which are the instruments
of justice where with all they whippe. And the two porters go with certain
tables listed up after the fashion and making of a target: wherein is written
the name of the Justice, and the charge and Office that he has: and those that
go before these do bid with a loud voice, that they give place, because it is
not permitted that any man of what degree soever he be should pass a thwart
the street nor walk, as long as these Judges pass, upon pain too be
whipped without remission that should do against it. This Prince has so
great care, that his Judges and Officers as well the Gouerners as Presidents and
all the rest should use their offices well, as they ought to do, that although he
do send from three years, to three years officers which are called Chaenes to
take account of the Judges, yet besides that, from vi. Months to vi.
Months, or from year too year, he does dispatche with all secret other
extraordinary Judges which are called Leachis, and are men that he has great
trust in, and those that are very familier with him, that they may visit those
Provinces with so great jurisdiction and authority, that without returning too
him, they may chasten al manner of offices be they never so great, and put out
of office al Judges and Officers at their will. And because they should execut^
this with more Justice, there is taken of them an oath of their faithfulness
and secrecy, giving them to drink three times of the wine, they use commonly
to drink of, which is the manner of their oath. And because he may go with
more secrecy, the Secretaries do make the letters pattents without any name
of him that shall go, nor whether he shall go more then to show in the
letters patents that in what place soever that Lawyer shall come and present
those letters patents, ^e be obeyed as the king himself, unto whom he shows
by word of mouth in secret, the Province whether he shall go. And so he
departs unknown without knowing unto any other whether he shall go. And in
coming too the place he sees, and understands al things that are used
there, and no man knows what he is, nor what he pretends, and in what
sorce all officers do minister Justice. And this not giving knowledge of any
thing what his coming is, he staieth until a day that the Presidents do
join together with the Tutam, too make a general consultation which is once
every Month. Then he goes in to present his letters patentes, and presently
they arise every one of them and go aside with great humility to hear
judgment against themselves, and forthwith they are executed. And if there
be any suspencion, then he does provide in their places other new officers:
and if he find that they have served well, he does honor the^ much and does
remove them to better places and of more trust. These are wont too visit the
Schools and examine the Students: and such as do not learn, he commands
them too be whipped and too be put in prison, and the unprofitable are put out
of their places, and such as are virtuous he offers them favor and
promises them hope of exhibition. There is an other office or dignity above
all these, which is that of the Quinchai, and is as much to say the sell of
gold. This man goes not out of the court, but when any great matter does
concern the king, and of the good government, and quietness of the whole
realm. In all causes as well civil as criminal, the Judges do proceed orderly
in their causes, and do make their acts and do examine the witnesses in
public before their officers and ministers, because there shall be no falsehod
nor deceit used in the as king of that which they know, nor in writing thereof.
They examine every witness by himself, and if they do agree in their
declarations and depositions they put them aside, and do ask the one and
the other, until they come to differ among themselves, because by reason that
the one and the other do allege they may come to declare the truth the better.
And when they can not understand the certainty, they whippe them, and give
them torment in such sort, that by one way or other, they may declare the
truth effectually. They have great respect in these causes too men of
estimation of whom they presume that they are not persons that will lie. In
causes of great importance and that does touch grave persons, the Judges
do not trust their Notaries too write the informations, but they with their
hands do set down all the acts. Of such as are prisoners for debt, there is a
time appointed wherein they shall pay them, and if they perform not, they
command that there be given too them many whippes, and they turn and
command a new. Another time, and if they pay not, they return too whippe
them again: and in this sort they proceeded with them until they dye with
strypes, if their kinsefolkes do not pay for them. When any dweller will pass
to another habitation in some other street then where he dwelt before, or go
too some other Town, they have a custom too ring upon an empty Basin by all
the neighbors with a common crier which shall say that such a person does
remove, and too what place, that if he owe any thing, that they come to
demand it before be depart, because no person should loose any thing dew
too them: if this person do absent himself without making this diligence, the
Justices do compel al his neighbors too pay all the debtes that he owe, because
they were so negligent and did not advise the Justice of his removing. Those
which are Prisoners for theft or murder, are kept perpetually in the prisons,
until they dye by whipping, or by hunger or cold. For although they be
condemned too death, they do execute the Judgment with such deliberation,
that many years after they come to die for necessity, as before is declared,
or of their natural death. And for this cause there are a great number of
prisoners in every City and Town. And it is affirmed that only in the City
of Canton are accustomed too be more then 15. thousand. And by reason there are
many people, and there is littel alms given, the poor people do give
themselves to steal. There is in this City and in all the rest which are of
the Metrapolitan xiii. Prisons, and in every one of them a wall of a great
circuit very heigh, and so large, that they have within the^ lodges for the
head keeper, and his officers, and for the soldiers of the watch, and
ordinarily there are gardens, and streets and courts within, where the
prisoners do walk by day, and there are many vittayling houses, where they
dress meat, and do hire beds, and Taylers shoppes; and other arts, that
the prisoners do use, too sustain and maintain themselves. Of these
thirtiene prisons there are always occupied six of them with men, which are
condemned too death, and in every one of them are a hundredth soldiers and more
with their Captain, too keep the said prison. Every offender does bring
hanging at his neck a board which comes too his knees and a spanne broad,
wherein is written the fact wherefore he was condemned, they go with fetters,
but in the day time they are taken of, by reason they may work too get
wherewithal to sustain them, over and above that which the king does give
them, which is a certain measure of Rice every day, unto such as are condemned
too dye, they shut them up in the night in certain lodges, which are near
too the courts, and they make them ly upon their backs, and upon them do
run certain Iron chains past through certain collers that are between
prison and prison: wherewith they are so fast made, that they can not escape.
And they lay upon them certain couerings made of timber, that there remains
to them no more space but their length and breadth which is a most painful
imprisonment. They never execute the Judgment that is given upon them, that
are condemned too dye, but when the Chaenes and Leuchis do go too take
residence and do make a secret visitation. Then these Judges do ask for the
roules of them that are condemned and the causes. And although that their
sentences are confirmed by the king and of those of his chief Council, they
return too see again their factes, with the rest of the Lawyers that do
govern: and being seen, they chose among vi. or viii. of those that do
seem too them too be most culpable. And they command the head keeper of the
prisons, that he give order too carry them too suffer execution. And this
being done they turn too see again anewe the factes, that by any means or
ways they may suspend the execution of some of them. And if they find any not
so worthy of death as the rest, they command that he be put aside from the
rest, and that there be shot of iii* pieces of ordinance which is a sign
or token that they take out of the prison such as shall dye. They turn to
co^sult again to see if they can deliver any other, and when they come not,
then they command to shootte of other three pieces, that they may be carried
out to the fields: and before they go forth of council they return too see
their causes a new. In this time they are set upon a heap of ashes and they
give them meat, tarrying for the last resolution, wherein they are accustomed
to deliver or relieve some. And because execution should be made in such as
do remain, they command too shoot of other three pieces of ordinance,
which is a sign that they should dispatch them: forth with there are ^oung
all the Belles, and there is through all the City a great rumor, as though
they were all amassed, because it is a thing which is seldom times done. In
these days they shut up their shoppes, and no body do work, nor they sell
any thing until ^unne set, which is when they take the bodies after execution
done upon them out of the fields for to bury them. And from that time they
do any buzines, and do open their shoppes. Also these Judges of residence do
see the roull of the thieves which still remain in prison and in recompense of
correction they command them always too be whipte. And they use in this
cause so much rigor, choler, and haste, as they use charytie and clemency
with such as they put too death, for there is no fact so much abhorred as that
is. The whippes they give them are most cruel and they give them upon the
calfes of their legs, their shoulders turned down ward and their hands
tied behind them with canes as broad as a hand, and of thickenesse of one
finger which they keep in water, that they may work the greater effect, in
such sort that at the first stroke the blood comes out, and the
executioners do whippe them together, one upon one leg and the other upon
the other and they do it with such dexterity and cunning, that of only two
stripes, I know not who is able too suffer them: and of fifty or sixty it
happens that there dye many, because their sinews are all loosed and
undone. Some Portingales do affirm that had been in those prisonnes, that
there dyed every year more then two thousand men of these whippings, and
some fell made of them, and of hunger and cold with they suffered. The said
Judges are present, when they whip them: and all the time that it endures,
they are occupied in eating and drinking and in pastymes without any manner of
grief therefore, and by reason it happens that sometimes some of these
Lawyers being bryved with great gifts or friendship are accustomed too see
at liberty some of these prisoners, and put others in their places, for there
never lacks some miserable people that for a little gain will put (...) the
watch and counterwatch. All these captains are of the same Provinces because
the love of their Country may cause them to serve truly, and cause them to
labor the more to defend them. And because there may be more quietness, it
is not permitted that any man shall carry any weapon, to offend, nor too
defend, but only such as are men of war. And besides these, there are in
the frontier towns and fortes which they have, in the confines of the Laos,
and Bramenes, and Tartarres, and Massagetas, ordinary garrisons for the defense
of them, and of the number which have been spoken of, was within the compass
of 200* leages, but this is done with advantage, by reason that in all parts
of the Country is great habitation, and having captains which do give them
assaults, they come as many to the defense as is needful, until the king
come with his great power, which he has always in a readiness, of many
footmen and horsemen for his guard and majesty, and to bridle the coming in
of his enemies. And for this cause he is always resident in the City of
Paquin, because it is a place that stands most commodiously for the succor
of all his towns, that are next bordering upon any foreign Prince. The people
of China are very prompt of wit, and stout in all the feats that does
apperteine to the wars. And although they are stout men, and of great
courage for to abide, and to give battle to the enemy, yet they always use
strange policies, and all kind of fire works in their battles, both by sea
and land, in such sort that there was nothing that did cause the Portingales ^o
marvel so much when they went thither the first time, as to see that they
used Artillarie. Whereof they came to understand that they had artillarie
among them many years before it was used in Europe* And it appears to be so,
because that in the Realm of Pegu, whether they came in old time, and where
in their conquestes, and in their fortifications, amongst other things they
left their Artillarie, and where there is found at this day, Belles and Gunnes
of metal, which they made. They use also of all kind of armor, and the most
principal Gentlemen of the Country do carry four swords with them, and fight
with two of them together, with great running.

They enter into the wars compassed about with many servants and familiar
friends, which are footmen, well armed, and very gallant, for it is so
permitted to all soldiers, and men of war. And by reason this king is so
mighty and rich, they which serve are paid at their time without any delay,
and with great liberality. And all such as show themselves valiant, are highly
esteemed, and rewarded with great gifts. The Tartarres and other enemies which
they take prisoners in their wars, they use them with no other captivity,
then to place them to serve for men of war in other frontiers of theirs,
which do border over against other Princes, and they are paid as he does pay
the rest of his subjects, and these wear certain red hattes, and the rest of
their apparel even after the fashion of the said people of China* The faced
hattes all people do wear, which are judged for an^e offense to serve in any
town that does border over against any other Prince, as those which go to
Oran, or Melilla, and so they say in their judgments that they banish them to
wear red hattes. This Prince is served with some Soldiers which are by nature
of the high mountains of Russia, which are a free people, and live after the
manner of warriors, like to the Esquizaros, which are mighty men, and with red
hair, and great beards, and they wear cut hose like to the Tudesos, and
broad swords, and they are called Alimenes, whom some do think that they are
Almaines, but if it were so, there would have been knowledge of this great
Realm long before. Likewise he is served of other tall men of twelve or
thirteen pawmes of height, and they do assist them in the defense of the
towns that stand in greatest danger, of whom we can not understand of what
region they are, and they make so great account of their own wisdom, after
the manner of the Greeks, that they say that they are those which have two
eyes, and the people of Europe but one* and that all the rest of other Nations
are stark blind.

The xv. Chapter shows of the religion, laws, and ceremonies which they have
and use.
IT is greatly to consider, that the Chinaes being so wise in their government
of their commonweals, and of so subtle a wit for all arts, that they are so
false of understanding, and so barbarous and blind in the worshipping of their
false and vain idolatry. For they have no manner of knowledge of the true
God, more than they imagine that al things which are created, does depend from
above, from whence do come the conservation and government of them all,
without knowing particularly who is the author, attributing it to the heaven it
self, which they hold for the greatest of their Gods, and so they signify it
with the first figure of their ABC. They worship the Moon, the Sun, and
Stars, and all other Images which they make without respect, and some figures
or shapes of Lawyers, and of the priests of their Idolles which they were most
affectioned to, in some principal service they had done. And likewise they
worship any manner of stones that they set upon their Aultars, where they do
make their Sacrifices, and also the Devil which they paint after the same
shape and manner as we do among us. The common sort of people do say that
they worship him, for because the good people, he makes Devils, and the evil
people he conuerteth into Kine, and other kind of beasts. The men of most
knowledge and that be most pollitique, they say they worship him and regard
him, because he should do the^ no hurt. They have in all cities and places of
habitation, and also in the fields, a great number of sumptuous Temples, and
of goodly buildings, which are of great Majesty. There are two sorts of
Priests, and they are contrary the one to the other in manners: the one sort
goes all shaven, and appareled in white, and with certain high cappes made of
felt somewhat piked before. These sort live in common together, and have their
chambers and lodgings after the manner of our Friars. The others do wear their
hair long, and divided in the higest part of their head with a strike very
curiously varnished with black, after the fashion of a haud closed together.
They apparel themselves with silk or black Serge as all the rest of them do
use: they dwell every one of them by themselves: they assist in the service of
the Temples, and in the festival days and burying. The one and the other are
not married, but they are evil livers, and therefore they are not esteemed
among the people, and they are punished with stripes amongst the Judges for a
small occasion. These people do offer in the Mornings and Euenings in their
Temples, Incense, Benjamin, the wood of the Eagle, and other things of
different and sweet smells. And the place of prayer which they use in their
house, is generally at the entry in of their gates, where their Idolles
stand. When they lanche their ships into the Sea at the first making, the
Priests go aparelled with long garments, being very rich of silk to make
their Sacrifices in the poopes of them, where the place of prayer is, and they
offer painted figures, and they cut and burn them before their Idolles with
certain ceremonies that they make, and sing songs with an unorderly tune,
sou^ding certain little belles. And they worship the Devil, where they have
him painted in the fore part of the Ship, because as they say, he should do
no hurt to the Ships. In all this discourse they are eating and drinking at
discretion. When they pretend to go upon any journey either by Sea or land,
or begin any buzinesse that seem difficult or hard, they use lottes, and cast
them before their Idolles. These are made of two sticks, after the fashion of
two half nuts, round at the one side, and the other side plain. And before
they be cast, they return to their Idols with fair words, beseeching them to
give good chance, and fortune: for by them they think does come good
success, or evil to them. And if it hap as they desire, then they will make
too them great offeringes: and with this they are cast, and if they fall with
the plain side upward, or the one side round, and the other plain, they
have it for an evil sign: and they return against the Idolles, and they
speak to them shameful and dishonest words, calling them dishonest dogs.
And when they be weary of calling them so any longer, then they turn again
with fair and sweet words, and ask them pardon of that which they have
said, and desire them too give them good fortune, promising them more then
before they had offered them: whereupon they turn to cast anewe, and by this
order they proceed praising them, and setting naught by them. And when they
tarry long, and if it be a matter of importance, they run to them, and
take them, and cast them into the Sea, and sometimes into the fire, suffering
them to burn a little, and they whippe them, and spurn at them with their
feet, until it hap to them as they desire, that is, the round parts of
these sticks to fall upward. And then they worship and praise them with much
Music and songs, and carry to them offerings, of Hens, Duckes, and Rice, all
dressed, and a Pigges head sodden, which they much esteem, and a great jar of
Wine, and of all this they set some part of it upon the Altar in a Platter
wherein is the tops or points of the Pigges ears and snout, and the nails
of Duckes and Hens, and a few granes of the Rice, and some drops of wine,
and all the rest they themselves eat before the Idols, with much mirth and
joy. When there dies any married man that has a wife and children and family,
immediately after he is dead they apparel him with the best apparel he had,
and they set him on a Chair, and there comes to him his wife, and does put
herself upon her knees before him, to take her leave of him with many tears,
and pitiful words she speaks, and consequently his children and kinssolkes
after the like order, and and all the rest of his householde following. And
this ceremony being done, they put him in to a coffin made of the wood of
Canfora, which is conseruatiue and of sweet smell, well made fast in all
points, because he should not smell. After this they put him into a Chamber,
which is hanged with white hangings of linen cloth upon two banks, and do
cover him with a cloth even to the ground, where in is shaped and formed the
dead man, very naturally made. And in another place of the house without, or in
the gate house coming in, they do put for ceremony a Table with candles
lighted thereupon, all full of bread, and of sundry sorts of fruits. And in
this sort they keep him xv. days, in the which time there do come at the
night season Priests continually to offer up their sacrifices, and to pray
their own inventions after the manner of Gentiles. They bring many Papers
painted, and with certain ceremonies they make, they burn some of them there,
and the rest they hang up in cords athwart for this cause, and they cast them
together, making noise that they send the dead men to heaven. All their
superstitions done, they take the coffi^, and carry him to the field, where the
rest of the dead bodies are, wherein time they are consumed. In all these days
there are in the house the Tabels set with many kind of meats, that the
priests may eat and drink, and their friends and acquaintance that do
visit them.

The mourning apparel which they use, is most sharp, because they bring their
clothes made of most course wool, nearest to the flesh, girte with hard
coards, and on their heads certain nightcappes of the said cloth, with edges
like to hattes, which falls down upon their ears. They ^eare this for
father or mother two or three years. And if they have any Son that is a
Lawyer, he does let the exer^se of his office which he has, and d^h retire
himself all this time until he has done, and then he returns a fresh to
the court, to do as he did before. But those that are not so nere in kindred,
do apparel them selves with raw linen cloth, not very course. They do
easily believe lies and feigned fables or tales, that men be converted into
beasts, and beasts into men, and other ignorant toys like too these. It is not
known certainly that any have preached to them the Gospel until the
Portingales came thither, more tha^ in the coast of Molea, which is the India,
of the side of the sea of Bengala, which they call now S. Thomas. Thither came
an Armenia^ on pilgrimage, and did affirm to the Portingals, y^ at that time
were there resident, that in the public wrytings, which the Armenians had,
there was relation and memory that before this glorious Apostle did suffer
martyrdom, he past to the China, and there did preach the Gospel. And
because he wrought little fruit in them, he returned to Molea, leaving some
Disciples that he had converted in that Country. Of the which there is no
knowledge found amongst them, more then this religious man has declared, and
said: that he had been in Canton, and from thence past to a small Island
that stands in the midst of the River before the City, where there is a
Monastery of those Priests gathered together, and therein he saw a Chapel,
built high from the ground, very well made with certain windows gilded,
wherein was the Image of a woman marvelously well made, with a Child at her
neck, and had before it the sign of a Lamp burning, and suspecting if it
might be any raze of Christianity, he did ask of those Priests, and of
other people that were there, what that Image did signify: and no body could
tell him, nor give him any reason thereof, and so it could not be determined,
if by chance it were the Image of our Lady that the Disciples of Saint Thomas
did set there*

There is not in all this Realm any Jews, nor raze of them. And it may be
well understood, seeing that the most meat they eat is Porke flesh. Neither
yet is there any Moors, although there are some that have descended of them
that are arrived thither from the Realm of Samarean, by trade of Merchandice,
and of such as were converted of the Country, but the most part of them dyed
by justice. These which are now, are descended of such as were vanished for
great no offense into diverse Provinces, and therefore there are some in
Canton, and others in Cansi, but as now they are few, and the children and
childrens children of those which were vanished, and borne of women of the
Country of China, all of them do eat ^orke, and drink wine, and there is no
man of remembrance of the sect of Mahoma.

The xvi. Chapter shows of the order that may be had, whereby these people may
turn to be Christians, and of the navigations that is made from the new
Spain, unto the Island of the West parts, called the Philippinas.
OF some religious men called Jesuits, it has been understood that they
began too preach the Gospel too these people, but by reason that it is not
permitted unto strangers too stay many days in this Country, they were
compelled too return forthwith without yelding that fruit which they
desired, notwithstanding they found the^ very apt to be caught, and willing to
learn, and easy to be reformed of their false Idolatry, and with all
humility they receive it, and acknowledged the corrections of their filthiness.
He that first began this Catholic work, was Master Frauncis Xauierre, one
of the seven Religious men of the first confirmation of the said company,
and was the first that came intoo Portingal, and that past intoo India, and
from thence to China. But before he began to execute his Catholyke desire, he
died in Canton, and was brought from thence too Goa, where his body lies
buried in the College of Saint Paul, of the same Religion. The Religious
Dominike declares that throwing down certain stones upon the ground which
they did woorshippe, they came unto him with such rage as if they would have
killed him, but he pacified them forthwith in giving them to understand their
little constancy and their vain Idolatry, and as they are of excellent wit,
they forthwith fell in to the matter, and thought well of his judgment saying,
that no man had ever taught them the like, until that time. And with the self
same excuse they excused them selves withal, when he did reprehende them of
the filthy sin not too be named, unto the which they are much given,
thinking that they do not evil therein. But the greatest difficulty that these
religious men found, was, that the gouerners and ordinary Judges do attend
with great care that no new thing be taught amongst them without order and
license of their king, and as they are rigorous and ready to chasten, no man
darre to be a Christian without license, although that they understand it to
be convenient for their salvation: and therefore it does import with expedition
that these inconuenie^ces be taken away, and that there be sent an Ambassador
too this great Prince. And in that Embassadge might go learned men, and
Religious, that should give them to understand the darkness wherein they live,
and too persuade them to be Christians, and that he should permit the^ too
preach the Gospel throughout al his Realm, and how that it is not hurteful
too take from him his Lordshippe and government but rather favorable, whereby
his subjects may obey him the better. This will be easily obtained of him, and
otherways for to attempt it by way of conquest, it will be so hard a matter
as it may be understood by his power and greatness, and by that which is
contained in a Chapter of the relation that the Captain Artieda gave to his
Majesty who was present at the conquest of the West Islands with are called
Philippinas, treating of this realm which word for word speaks as
follows. There are also to the Northwarde of these Ila^ds the firm la^d which
they call China. It is a great Country, insomuch that it is certainly known
that it bordereth with Tartaria, for the people that trade thither, say that
they have ware with them. They are a people very politic, they work Iron with
percers of steel. I have seen gold and silver wrought so well with Iron as
could be in the world, and in this sort they work things of timber and
all other things. They say that the Portingales, are good people, and that
they have a littel light of the world, but in comparison too them they see but
with one eye. They spin gold as they do in Milan, and weaue Damask and other
silks with it. They have all kind of armor as we have, and artillery Judging
it by certain vessels that I have seen come from thence, that it is plain
and better cast the^ our is. They have so good government, that they say they
make neither Governor nor Captain which is not a great Astronomer. And first
they shall pronosticate the time and chance that is too come, and it shall be
proved and seen to fall out true, that he may prevent any thing that is to
come. In every City and Province, there are garrisons of men of war, they
go well apparelled: they are as white as we are, and wear there beards long.
The women are very fair, although that all of them have little eyes, they
wear their coats and gowns so long that they touch the ground, and they
make their hear red with colors, and it is said that they painte their
faces. They say this king is of so great power, that he does bring into the
field three hundredth thousand men, and two hundredth thousand of them
horsemen. In things that are painted* I have seen brought from thence wherein
are painted on horseback armed men with harness and salets and lances. The
country is so good and so well furnished with vittaile, that it is thought to
be the best and most fertile soil of the world: The Moors that I have spoken
withal do affirm that they be not so warrelike as we are.

They have Mouldes and have printed books time out of mind. If it please your
Majesty, that this Country be seen with the sight of the eyes: I do offer
my self thereunto, giving me two Ships of two hundredth and fifty to^nes a
piece, little more or less, and 40. Soldiers in every ship and the
Artillarie, Munition, and Uittaile, sufficient and necessary, with Gods healpe
carrying some order of Embassadge to the Lord of the Country to enter in with
my person, and too return all along the coast by the new Spain. And too see
the order they have as well for the trade with in the land as for all the
rest if that will please your Majesty.

And in that which this Captain says that the king does bring three hundredth
thousand men intoo the field, besides the garrisons that he has ordinarily
in the Cities, and towns that do border nearest other Princes in this my
opinion remains verefied. And although they be not so warrelyke as we are,
as the Moors have declared, I know not what power were sufficient for so
great a number of horsemen, and against people so well armed, the Artillarie
being so common to them as it is to us. And seeing there is required that there
should pass thither, so great a navigations, and seeing this great Country
does fall within the compass of the conquest of our Catholic king, it will be a
thing of importance that his Majesty do command too ordeine this
Embassadge with the good will of his holiness, whereby this Prince may reduce it
to the government of the holy Catholic Church, whereof may grow great
effects in the increasing of the Christian Religion. And this is very easy to
be done, seeing that our Spayniardes are become so near neighbors to that
realm and the Navigations so near and certain as here in it is declared.
There is in the new Spain in the South part thereof two ports or havens: the
one is called Acapulco, which stands in xvii. degrees, and a half of height
which will hold many ships although they be great, and the other is called
the Puerto de Na^edad, which has the entry in of it very low, and stands in
nynetiene degrees and a terce large. From these ports do go forth the
ships that do sail too the Philippinas, and they go too put themselves in
the height that the course of the Island is in, for the time when they goo
forth upon this Navigations which is in the end of October the winds are
always Northerly in that coast until the end of April: Wherewithal they go
with the wind in their poope running west, and from the end of April until
the end of October they turn too blow at West Southwest, which serves them
too return, rising up intoo a higher degree that they lack no height. They
met at their going with the Islands called Barbudos, for they were so named, for
because such as do inhabit there, do let their beards grow long. These people
are apparelled with mattes made of the bows of date trees very fine, and they
have no weapons nor war with any Country, and their vittaile are Cocos, and
rottes and fish, and they have hens like to those of Spain, more toward
the west. They turn and meet with the Islands which they call of the thieves
which be xiii. and they lie in length North and South, the greatest may be
little greater then forty leages. They are al well near after one fashion and
trade. The weapons they have he s^ings, and rods dried with the fire which
do serve them in place of lances. They shootte so far with the s^ings that
no hargubuse can shoott fo far. They live with Ryce and fish, Cocos and roots,
there are in the^ great quantity of Ginger, and so beyond that more toward
the West, they fall with the Islands of the Philippinas which are many. The
Ila^d of Mindanas which is the first of the South side: it begins in five
degrees in the height of the North: and it lies out showing it self in length
as the rest do, which stand as a company of trees in the Northnorthwest
course, until you come into xiii. degrees and a terce, where you meet with the
Island of Luzon. This Island is in length out unto the nynetiene degree in the
same course, there is in it three places inhabited with Moors, they know not
perfectly of what sect they are of, but they give reverence to Mahoma: they
eat no porke. They have many rivers wherein they gather gold: and it is
distant from this firm land of China less then one hundredth leages, and from
the City of Canton which falls too the North part of it: one hundredth and
thirty, and little more. Our Spaniards are in possession of the said Island,
and by reason the trade is great from it too the firm land and for the
curious things that are come from thence to the new Spain, and from thence too
his majesty now they call him China.

ALL that is written of the great lordship of China in this work, I have
gathered my self with great diligence and care of men worthy of faith;
Portingals, that have been there with merchau^dise, and of other buzines; as
also of the said people of China, which have come too Spain: of whom I took
that which I thought to be certain, and most meet for this short discourse*
