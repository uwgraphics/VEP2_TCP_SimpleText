A DECLARAtion of the Kings pleasure, published after his departure from
Paris: importing the cause of his sudden and forced going away.
TRusty and well-beloved. Being in our Town of Paris, where we bent our only
cogitatio^s to no other thing but the appeasing of all sorts of ielouzies and
disturbances in Picardy and else where, which hindered our journey into our
Country of Poictou, there to prosecute the wars enterprized against the
Huguenotes, according as we had resolved, our cosen the duke of Guize unawares
to us, did there ariue the ninth of this month. His coming after that sort so
increased the said ielouzies and distrustes, that we were much troubled
therewith: the rather for that before we had from diverse places been
aduertized, that he should come in such manner: also, that he was looked for, by
sundry the inhabitants of the same town, who were suspected to be the
authors of the said distrusts, besides that our self had before for the same
cause given him to understand, yt we were nothing desirous of his coming
before we had appeazed the aforesaid troubles of Picardy, and quite taken away
the causes of the same. Considering nevertheless, that he came accompanied
only with fourteen or fiftene horses, we were content to see him, and that
the rather to the end to endeavor so to deal with him that all occasions of
ielouzie and distrust might be extinguished: wherein seeing how smally we
profited, as also that our said Town grew daily more and more replenished
with Gentlemen and strangers, retayners to the said Dukes train: also, that
such searches, as we caused the magistrates and officers thereof to make, were
through the fear wherinto they were driven, performed to halues: likewise, that
the hearts and affections of sundry the enhabitants were daily provoked, and
more and more alienated: together with the ordinary aduertizementes whereby we
were from time to time informed of some great troubles to fall out in ye same
town, we determined to cause the said searches to be more exactly performed
throughout all the quarters thereof thou the former, to the end thereby to
discover and truly find out the state of the same, also to avoid such
strangers as should be found not to be aduowed as they ought. For the
performance whereof we thought it good to strengthen certain the bodies of
the gardes of the enhabitants and burgeses of the same Town whom we had
appointed to be planted in four or five corners thereof, with the companies of
Suitzers, and such as were of the regiments of our guard: who before were
lodged in ye suburbs: also to command diverse the Lords of the counsel and
knights of our order of the holy ghost, to march along the streets and quarters
thereof accompanied with the quarter masters and others the officers of the
said Town, such as have been usually accustomed to make the said searches, to
the end by their countenance to authorize and assist them in the same, as has
sundry times bin practiced. Whereof also we gave notice to the said Duke, and
all the enhabitantes of the said Town, least any thereof should take
allarom or any whit doubt of our intent in this point, which order at the
beginning the Burgeses and dwellers seemed to take quietly and in good part:
Howbeit within a while after matters grew so whot and that the rather through
the induction of diverse who wandering up and down informed the said
enhabita^ts that we had not brought in the said forces for auy other end, but
only to establish foreign garrisons within the Town aforesaid, yea, and to
deal worse then so: whereby in short space they had so animated and stirred
them up, that if we had not expressly forbidden the leaders of our troops
from attempting any thing against the said enhabitants, and withal commanded
them rather to bear and endure all extremities then to offer any violence, we
do undoubtedly believe that it had bin impossible to eschew the general sack
of the Town and much bloodshed. This when we perceived, we determined to
cease the execution of the searches aforesaid, also to cause our forces to
retire whom we had not brought in, but upon that only occasion: as also it
was no other like, but that if we had me^t otherwise we would have attempted,
yea, and peradventure put in execntion whatsoever our purposes before the
rising of the said enhabitantes, either that they had drawn their chains or
erected their defenses in the streets, which immediately after noone they went
in hand withal, and in a manner in one instant thronghout all the streets of
Paris, being thereto induced and persuaded by sundry gentlemen, Capteines and
other strangers sent in by the said Duke of Guize, who to the same end, in
very short space appeared, divided and aranged, throughout every quarter of the
Town. Hereupon causing the said Switzers and french companies, to return,
the said enhabitantes to our great grief discharged diverse Harquebuze shot,
and dealt some blows which light cheefely upon the said Switzers, whom the
same evening we commanded to retire and lodge about our Castle of the Loure,
there to expect the event of this commotion of the said townse-men: for the
appeasing whereof, we did all that possibly we could, yea, so far forth as the
next day to procure all the said companies, except such as before their coming
in we had placed in guard before our said Castle, to depart the town, as being
informed that in so doing, we might greatly content and pacify the said
inhabitants: as also we caused to stay some remaynder of the companies of
foote-men of the regiment of Picardy, albeit they were as yet seven or eight
leagues off, together with diverse Lords and gentlemen our servant that drew
unto us: as considering yt the same had bred some shadow to this people, also
yt they took hold of this pretense, where by the more to provoke and stir them
up. All this notwithstanding, in liew of finding our wished effect to their own
benefit and our contentation, they nevertheless still proceeded in raising
their bulwacks, strengthening their guarde night and day, and approaching the
same toward our said Castle of the Loure, even to the very sentinels of our
ordinary guarde, as also they seized upon the townhouse of the same town,
together with the keys of S. Anthonies gate and other the gates thereof: so
that by the thirteenth of this month, matters were run so far that it
seemed impossible by man's power to stop the effect of greater violence and
commotion, even before our said castle gates. This when we perceived, and
being nevertheless unwilling to employ our said forces against the said
enhabitantes, as having evermore held the preservation of the said Town with
the enhabitants thereof, as dear as our own life, as in sundry their
occasions they have well tried and is evident to all men, we determined the
same day to depart, and rather to absent our selves, and abandon the place
which above all the world we most loved, and so do still desire to do, then
to see it encurre further hazard or receive greater damage: having withal
entreated our most honorable Lady and Mother to stay, and try whether she
might through her discretion and authority in our absence be able to find
any means, how to appeaze the said tumult, which notwithstanding, whatsoever
her endeavors, she conlde not in our presence perform, and so are come into
this our Town of Chartres, from whence we thought good immediately to send
you these presents therein desiring you to consider of the consequence of this
cause, how prejudicial and hurtful it will be, in case it go forward, unto
the common cause, especially to our holy catholic, Apostolic and Romish
religion, since that they who were wont to fight together for the propagation
thereof, shall through this accident (if it be not remedied) be disunited and
forced to turn their weapons each against other: to eschew the falling
wherinto we pray you to believe that for our parts we will do whatsoever
possibly we may: of such force is the zeal that we bear unto our said
religion, as hitherto we have sufficiently caused to appear. We also, so much
as in us lies, exhort and pray you to procure supplications to God in your
Churches for this reunion, as also that the obedience unto us due, be observed
according as is meet, and not to suffer the enhabitants of our Town of M. to
depart the right paths thereof: but to admonish and persuade them to remain
quiet and constant in their loyalties to their King: and in union and concord
one with an other, so to maintain and preserve themselves under our obedience,
and not to encurre the disco^modities for them provided, if they take any other
course. Thus besides that you shall perform an action worthy your discretions,
fidelities and duties, which may be a notable example to all subjects, we
shall yield you thanks for ever, and acknowledge it to you and yours.

Given at Chartres. May. 1588
