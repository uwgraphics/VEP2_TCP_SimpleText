Silius Italic. lib. 1. bell. punicum. A TRVE RELATION OF THE DAILY CONFLICTS,
and proceedings between the great Turks Army, and his Majesty of POLAND, to
the end of the Wars.
THere shall need no preamble, nor insinuation to this discourse, more then
that you have had already a published Pamphlet of the news of Poland, showing
plainly the occasion of the Turks formidable preparation against that
Country, with his descending in person into Walachia, and coming to many
skirmishes and battles, affording as many rumors of the several events and
successes in the same; insomuch that many reported Poland was overrun, and
Sigismond slain: Yet there is but one truth which that book in general sets
out: yet so far short of satisfaction, that it comes not near any particular
indeed, whereby men went away, as if they had only looked on the outward
painting and bravery of a house, without once being admitted to ouer-looke, how
necessary and convenient it was in the inward rooms. Therefore I will promise
you amends, though in a plain fashion, and this relation shall supply the
defects of the other. For I will presently come to the purpose, and begin with
the beginning of September: after the Polacks had entrenched themselves, and
the Turks and Tartars came as near them as might be.

Know then, that the second of September stilo nou^, the Turks and Tartars
encamped themselves by us within a mile, or half a mile, and the same day
began hotly upon us, brauing our trenches, which we would not endure, but came
to blows, and made a skirmish, in which eight hundred Turks perished, as by
many Captives and Prisoners, which we took in the flight, was afterward
confessed, besides such as were slain near hand in the charges, and far off
with the Bullets, both of our field Pieces and Muskatieres: on our side
perished Tarouits and Bochdan, two Commanders of Light Horse, and the Lord
Lauizza of the Cohort of the Camp-Master, was shot in the foot with a great
Bullet, two Masters of the best men of Arms slain, and above 30. other of
several Companies hurt.

The third of September, they proceeded in the same manner, and we with some
light excursions set upon them, till at last they burst out in three several
parts against our trenches, especially where our Cossacks were quartred, and so
came to the very out-skirts of our Polish Army, who had command to keep
themselves within their Tents and Trenches, and annoy the Turks with their
great Artillery, and so we prospered for that time, driving them into their
Camp, wherein by Sunne-setting they quickly retired: the same evening our
noble Prince passed over the River, and came into our Camp with all manner of
comfort and courage, but the Army he brought with him, with provision of
warlike Ordnance, and other Munition necessary for us, could not come at us, by
reason the Bridge brake by the force of the water, which not three days before
they had builded up and erected.

The fourth of September, by the Sun rising, the Emperor of Turks, would
needs in person be a beholder of the skirmish, and so in a manner approached the
Camp of the Cossacks, bringing many field Pieces, and mounting such, which
they call Ianscharki, and so a great battle began, which lasted full five
hours: For the Cossacks much endamnified by the Artillary, made so brave a
salley upon the Turks, that they drove them back by maine force, and put a
number of them to the sword, insomuch that they altered their determination,
and brought their Ianskarks before the quarter, where the Camp-Master was
lodged, but here it was too hot for them: and it did not succeed, as they
expected, so they charged the Cossacks once again, riding by our trenches in a
brauing manner, and coming upon them with an insulting violence, which yet
prospered not, as they expected: whereupon not an hour before Sun setting,
they charged them more violently, but God was our defense at this time: For the
Cossacks made so brave a salley, that they put the Turks to flight even to
their Tents, with such a slaughter, and such a success, that they surprised
their Artillery, took many Tents, and carried with them much furniture, and so
returned before dark night with the booty, to their own Camp and lodging.

The fifth of December, we were quiet on both sides: For the Turks removed
their quarter a little more backward, yet with full resolution to set upon us
again, as by many prisoners we took was confessed: whereupon we fell to our
accustomed prayers to God, and about noone there fell a rain, and so there was
nothing attempted that day, but that we prepared our selves for the expugnation.

The sixth of September, there fled unto us a Cossack, one of the inhabitants by
the river of Danubius, who had been seven year in servitude with the Turks,
and affirmed, that there were slain 2000. Ianissaries in the last skirmishes,
and expupuation of our Camp; that the great Turk himself would lead the whole
Army in person, except such as he must needs leave for the defense of his Camp,
and the security of his cattle: that already there began to be a great dearth
amongst them. For four pound of bread was worth 24. Aspers of silver, and a
quantity of Barley or other Corn, equalling the half bushel of the measure of
Camenensis, was valued at seven Florins, and 15. Aspers, and that many
discontents appeared amongst them already. The same day there came also unto us
a Dutch man, who had fallen into the hands of the Turks, as a prisoner with a
Captain of the Cossacks, and he assured us that on Friday Asis Bassaw, a man
of great reputation among the Turks, was struck in the forehead with a Bullet,
and so slain; and that so many Turks were overthrown in the last several
on-sets upon the Cossacks, that they began to fly every where from their
quarter and Cabbines: he also related the cause, why the Turks were so quiet,
which was by reason of a larges, or donation of money the Turk bestowed upon
such, who had behaved themselves well in the last enterprise, preparing for new
assaults: and this was the truth of the matter.

The seventh of September the Turks came upon us again in the after noone,
and very outragiously in great companies assaulted our Bulwarks, which were
yet unperfected, and lay somewhat naked to opposition, ascending the same, and
taking as it were possession: but with equal loss, as it appeared for the
time, until the noble Lord Steward of the Kingdom, who came there by chance
with his troop of Horse, set upon them most valiantly, and by the assistance
of the Lord Castellano Plocen, and P. Radomina, put them off the walls to a
fore-flight, as far as the wood scited even before the Turks Camp, whether
they followed them in the slaughter: as for such Turks as at first dared to
approach our Trenches, and scale our Mounts, they all perished upon them, we
not loosing above twelve men of Arms in that service, with some few other
hurt, except Castellanus Plocen, who with many wounds returned, and died the
next day: But the assault against the Cossacks endured from noone to night;
ours only lasted from the afternoon to Sun setting, yet both continued
with so fearful effects, that the multitude of the slaughtred was apparent,
and the Enemies carcasses lay in heaps in the fields: Yea, it was remarkable,
how all that night the Turks made a search with lighted firebrarnds, and other
Lamps, for some person of account amongst the dead bodies, which as some of
their own fugitives affirmed, was one of the Viceer Bassas, who was missing,
and could not be found.

The eighth of September, there escaped out of the Turks hands a Cossack, who
had long lain in fetters, he came to us by night, and told us plainly, that
the Turks had laden many Cammels with the encumbrances of the Army, and
furnished the carriage Horses, as if they meant to make some retreat:
notwithstanding, the same day very inconsiderately they came upon the Cossacks
again, who by the help of the Germans now amongst them; both defended
themselves, and offended their Enemies: for here were brave Commanders, partly
under the Regiment and conduct of Captain Drhusoff, partly under Captain
Lermund, and of the other side in the right wing, there were the Cohorts of his
Excellency, the Lord Palatine. The same day Schandactus cut off by the sword,
according to the manner and custom of a Military Court, who adjudged him to
die, a principal Captain of the Cossacks, called Brondanka, who the year
before had abused his prerogative, and most peruersly by factious devises, and
apparent thefts, had transcended the government of a Commander in chief, and
fallen to thefts and robberies more then necessity, or the present wants
enforced.

The same day a certain Squire escaped out of the hands of the Turks, who was
unfortunately taken prisoner at a battle in Cicora, and came unto us,
affirming confidently, that since the Turks coming into the field, there are
diminished at least twelve thousand of their number, some slain outright,
some dying of their wounds, some surprised in the Camp, and some flying away.

The ninth of September, the great Turk after noone drew out all his Army in
battle array: which Lord Magnus our General perceiving, detracted no time,
but prepared for the fight: so that both Armies even to Sun setting, stood
looking upon one another, without any man's giving the sign of the battle,
not daring to approach too near the fortifications, and Bulwarks of our
Trenches; but stood as remote as they could, and farthest from danger. In the
mean while, the Ianizaries fell foul upon the quarter of the Cossacks again,
and continued little less then four hours in a dangerous skirmish: For the
Germans playing their part on the other side, as assisting the Cossacks in
their Warre-like excursions, quickly, when they pressed them with fury and
impetuosity, compelled them back to their Camp, and we returned to our
Trenches: But the same night another prisoner escaped, and came unto us,
affirming that of the Spahies, who were the forwardest in this expugnation, as
so commanded by the Captain of the Ianizaries, lost two hundred of their
Company, and of the Ianizaries were slain, with such as perished in the flight
1500.

The tenth of September, the Turks were somewhat quiet, as peradventure
wearied with the former days mischief, and we far apparent the various
chances of War, and the wonderful essects of a Battle.

The eleventh of September, the Turks made a new appearance out of their Tents,
with a goodly Army: and we were not behind to Marshall our Companies to as
brave a show: but nothing was done that day, and so we returned on all sides
to lodging: yet while we remained in this expectation, the Turks had
transported their Ordnance to the other side of the River, from whence he
played continually into the quarters of the Cossacks all that day: but when he
saw, they did them no more harm, he quickly drew them back again; and
placed them more securely: The same day, some thousands of Tartars showed
themselves on that side of the River also; who with their accustomed clamours
and outcry, attempted the breaking of our Bridge: but only two hundred foot,
whereof one was killed, and two hurt with Bullet, pressed upon them with such
volleyes of shot, that they were quickly put to flight. God grant we may be
thankful for these things. For without controversy, Gods only hand has
protected us, that both on the one side the Turk is more remiss then his
former threatenings, and this present appearance promised; and we on the other
side we have had greater courages, and better success then we could any
manner of way expect.

The twelfth of September, a little after midnight, we determined to set upon
the Camp of our Adversaries, leaving our noble Prince sufficiently guarded
within the Trenches, as not well at ease, and so the Army divided it self into
parts, having instructions to come upon them unawares: the one to compass the
Woods, and set upon them in the rear, and at their backs: the other to
outface them in the front and sides, that something might be done every way.
But it pleased God to send so great a shower of rain, that we were diuerted
from our purposes at this time: but I make no question of a better opportunity,
and that our Adversaries little knew of this project, and so we may once
again see the stratagem on foot, till when we retired to our Trenches
securely.

The 15. of September, the Turks and Tartars, with a great resolution and
impetuous assault, pressed both upon us, and the Cossacks in three several
parts, neither fearing our Artillery, nor making account of our Trenches: the
great Turk himself being a spectator on an eminent Hill, whose youth
apprehended the mischief but as a sport. For without any manner of remorce for
the perishing of so many thousands, they came forward like furious beasts
without Discipline or order, and so perished like Beasts, when the Artillery
played upon them, and we rushed out as violently well armed and appointed in
the smoke against them, this Battle lasted from Noone to Night, and the God
of Battles for his mercy sake, did frustrate and annihilate both the purpose
and the rage and fury of our Enemies, nor ended it so, but for his Glories sake
we prevailed with a great slaughter, and little loss on our side: So that it
should seem all their threatening and fury was in vain, concerning the
attempting of our Trenches, and the Angels of the Lord spread his wings over
our Tents: On the other side our Soldiers were so courageous, and animated, as
infused with new Spirits from the same God, that they not only rushed out of
the ports and passages of their Quarters upon their Enemies, but hurried over
the Trenches and Ditches to forward the enterprise, and so came to handiblowes,
and with extraordinary valor and slaughter sent them home again.

In this Skirmish we did not altogether go scotfree, but saw the perishing of
thousands of Turks and Tartars, whose Carcasses bespred the ground as it were:
and among whom there perished the great Bashaw surnamed Koraken, who newly
came to the Emperor and was most dear unto him, and well accepted of him: the
same Fate and trial had Nassan Bassaw with many Chawses and Spahies, and a
number unnumbered of common Soldiers.

After this slaughter the Turks attempted no more the expugnation of our
Camp, except that once they did invade the quarter of the Cossacks, but with
the like success, yet many times they brought out their Armies to open view,
and as many times God of his mercy made way to our preuailings, and we
returned Victors: The same day the Bridge was finished, which they had a while
ago begun over the River, that divided their Camps: but to what purpose is
not known, except to accommodate their passages the better: now also returned
the Lord Siclentius, who had bin sent into the Palatinate of Moldauia with
answer to a Letter, which they sent before, but what other news he brought, is
not apparent: It was also discovered, that a rumor was spread into the Turks
camp, that the Sacred Majesty of Sigismond the King our Master, was come into
the Field with a Royal supply, and general expedition, which a little
affrighted the Tartars, who were now to fight against fortifications and Armed
men, contrary to their barbarous custom of devouring one another naked.

The 17. of September, our great Lord General held a martial Counsel with
the Lord Senators, Dukes, Governors, and Captains, to which were also called
the Lord Sahaidace, General of the Cossackes with all his Colonels, and
Officers, who with one voice, and unanimity of Spirit concluded and agreed,
rather to die manfully in the field, then to go back one foot of ground, to
give the Enemy cause of presumption: and this was done with such general
alacrity, that although both the Armies, I mean, the Polonians and Cossacks,
were in great distress and wants; yet they concluded, that by Gods grace, they
would not be terrefied with any Enemy.

The 18. of September, certain troops of horse, and Companies of foot, made a
salley out of the Cossacks quarter in the night upon the Turks Army, which was
done so secretly and suddenly, that they ouer-turned many Tents, ransacked
diverse Cabins, and killed some hundreds of men with Iauelings, Pollaxes, and
Lances, without the report of a Piece, or carrying any Artillery with them:
yea, herein they were so fortunate, that they returned with great spoil,
without the loss of a man. The next night they performed as much, and with the
like stratagem set upon the Bridge they had newly builded and erected, and slew
Corkan Bassaw, to whose custody and charge it was committed. They also killed
many Turks, took nine prisoners, and returned with great spoils and a rich
prey, wherein were diverse garments furred with costly Furs, which I think,
the Turks use among the Tartars, who upon many excursions, made into Russia by
thousand^ in these days, returned with a wonderful spoil, selling them at a
price to the Turks: and this was done even as they came along to take up their
lodgings in these Provinces.

At this time his Excellency, the Lord General, was subject to a great
sickness, which so impaired his health, that he feared his life: whereupon he
summoned all Officers, and referred his government to the Lord Camp, Master
General, with all Millitary privileges, and imperial functions, inuesting
upon him as far as he could his dignity and authority; yet were the whole
Army desirous to see the heroic Prince himself mounted on horseback, as
their Commander General, though as yet very young, so that by this joy and
good minds of the Army, he was much comforted, and incited to thank them all,
and be the more gracious unto them, when time should serve.

The 24. of September, having layne quiet a great while, an accident at home
disquieted us all: For our great Lord General, laboring long in his
sickness, and being wearied and spent again with intolerable convulsions,
and distemperature of the air, yielded to the command of a higher General,
and so died in the Camp.

The 25. of September, the Emperor of Turks made a great preperation to set
upon us on all sides, drawing out from their several Quarters, both Horse,
Foot, and Artillery, to oppress and expugne us with an irresistable power; and
so they approached our Trenches with accustomed clamours and outcries: but the
same God, that kept us from the beginning, continued still our Protector, and
all their attempts were annihilated, turning rather to the destruction of many
of their own Soldiers, then to our detriment.

The 26. of September, Baptista was dispatched, who was sent unto us from the
Palatine of Moldauia, with Letters and other intelligence: he came but the
Tuesday before with the Lord of Zielenskij, who assured us, that the Turks had
a great desire to treat of a peace; and therefore Baptista had in charge to
deal with the Viceer, for safe conduct of such Commissioners, as might be sent
to tractate about the peace and quietness of both Armies.

Within three days our Soldiers set upon some part of the Tartars Quarter, as
being much displeased, that the passages were stopped up by them: whereby the
Soldiers that went a forraging, and to gather fodder and litter for their
Horses, were much diappointed: so that in revenge they put many to the sword,
and set their Quarter on fire.

The 27. of September, the Turks having strongly mounted diverse great Pieces,
and placed their Gabbions about them, as is the custom, played fearfully into
the Cossacks Quarter, and spent all the fore-noone in the sending hundreds of
Bullets among them: but when they perceived that it smally auailed, they
desisted, and made a new attempt in their own persons nearer unto them: which
when the Cossacks perceived, either loath to be out-braued at their own walls,
as I may say, or encouraged by the thriuings of many out-roades and excursions
they had formerly made: or emboldned by their own sufficiency, or presuming on
the weakness, and nakedness of their Adversaries, I might add their
barbarous hastiness, and bestiall howlings and outcries; they sallyed out
bravely, with the most part of their Army, and compulsed them back, driving
them into their Quarters with a great slaughter, and a great speediness: and
the same day, to the comfort of us all, our noble Prince, whose long untimely
sickness, as it were, sadded our hearts, recovered some strength, riding round
about the Army, being entertained with great showts and acclamations of the
Soldiers, and showing in himself apparent signs of recovery, as having layne
under the shakings of a fearful Ague, almost ever since we encamped our
selves, to whom the King did daily send Physicians, and Messengers, and would
willingly have come himself in person; but that all his Peers and
Counsailours would not hazard all at once, considering what a formidable Enemy
had threatened him, and fearful preperation in a manner circumcepted him:
therefore they proiected to keep him as a second, and that securely, that if
the Turks should prevail (which God forbid) against these Forces well ordered
and marshalled within these Trenches: there might yet a new Muster be made, and
Army trained, whom the presence of a King, and worthiness of so great a
Commander might bring together, and set upon the Triumpher with fresh supplies.

But oh thou God! What an alteration was here? He that threatened these
Polonians with insulting ostentation, by Ambassies, Letters, and an innumerable
company of Mahumetans and Tartarians: he that had denounced defiance against
all Christendom: he that had spoken presumptuous words against any force,
should come by way of opposition: he that adventured his person as far as his
greatness might descend, to be a Spectator of this woeful Tragedy, wherein the
ministers of War and destruction must play their parts, and he which had
brought one hundred cast Pieces into the field, to batter all fortifications
into rubbish: had now an answer returned of strange contradiction, had now his
threats retorted with as available menaces, had now his rages sent back
again with unexpected fury, had now his presumption rebated with as noble a
defiance, had now his way blocked up and intercepted, that he could not so
quickly come over Pallisados, and Trenches, had now Cannon to Cannon, battery
to battery, and though not so many, as himself brought, yet so well appointed,
and so efficatious in the designs, that he was not so forward in his glory as
he determined, nor so furious in any execution, as he promised: Nay, if it had
been as well known to us as himself, he repented that ever he came into the
fields of Walachia, and as you shall hear hereafter, both retracted his first
arrogance, and whispered a peace, though he durst not speak it aloud, for
fear of the Ianizaries.

But oh you sons of men! what say you to rumor, and the credulity of
uncertain reports? what say you to passion, and the disordered burstings out
of your own wishes? What say you to affrightings, that because you hear of
the greater numbers, will therefore presently show the greater partiality? How
often within this twelve month has Bogdonia been ransacked, Podolia
distressed, Polonia overrun, Sigismond slain, and the Army discomfited, and
yet (thanks be to God) the trenches were never cast down, the Soldiers
disarmed, the troops slaughtred, the King in danger: (For he was scarce in the
field at all) or any fearful loss endured, more then they that must be lost
in so many conflicts, and such impetuous assaults: and thus much by way of
transition. Now to our business again.

The same night, that the Prince had showed himself, the day before the
Cossacks being set upon, as you have heard, suddenly assaulted the Quarter of
their enemies, especially the Tartars, who lay without any manner of
discipline, or strong fortifications: yea, this they did twice in one night,
and that with such success, that besides the slaughter, and hauock they made,
they returned with great spoils, and booty, yea greater then the Enemy could
spare, or were willing to loose; this they did often, and although sometimes
their actions were obumbrated with some discomfiture: yet did they never make
any salley, without the greater slaughter of their Enemies. Now is Baptista
come back again from the Enemies Camp, bringing Letters from Vesin Bassha,
of safe conduct and admission, as he himself had had experience by himself
for such Commissioners, as the King of Poland would put in trust for the
dispatch of so high affairs: yea, he said plainly, as far as he could
conjecture, that never was any thing so pleasing to the Turk and his
Soldiers, as the name of peace, considering the times, and the manner of the
War; especially that his reputation was saved by the first seeking it by the
Polonians: wherein he used this policy, to make the Ianizaries believe, he was
of himself unwilling to darken the glory of the Othoman family, by demanding
peace himself at any inferior Nation in the world.

Notwithstanding all this motive of quietness, which Baptistas Letters
demonstrated, might come to equal conclusion by orderly Commissioners. The
Grand Signieur proiected with all the force, bravery, and policy he could, to
set upon the Cossacks again, who were his Ancestors Enemies, and more
obnoxious unto him, then any neighbors whatsoever: and because he would make,
as it were sure work of the matter, he acquainted Tartar Chrim, who they say
accompanied him to the War with the same, and he either of necessity obeying,
or out of custom consenting, or for his own reuenges willing, quickly accord,
and by break of day brought all his Tartars to the place appointed for the
expugnation: whereupon they ordered the matter so, that in the manner of a ring
they compassed our Trenches round about: first playing over their heads into
our Camps, with many great Ordnance, which were mounted in three several
places; then transported they over the River thirty more, which continually
beat both upon ours, the Lissauonians, and the Cossacks Tents, and that for the
space of diverse hours, sending likewise fiery Spears, burning Darts, and
sulphury Balls amongst us, insomuch that our Prince lying yet sick in his
Tent, had the Captain of his Guard slain with a Bullet. Among the
Lissauonians three of the best men of Arms were killed outright: and among the
Cossacks one or two hurt.

After this, with strange assaults and fearful violence, they pressed upon
the two special passages of our Camp: whereat the one stood firm, the Lord
Camp Master General, with a great and strong Battalion: at the other, the
Lord Palatine Culmensis: in the Marketplace, the Lord Doenhoff, with many
Germans: in a word, we were all in Arms, and the Cannons played on both
sides as far as they could, for hurting those in their own Quarters: at last
on a sudden with accustomed cry the Tartars gave on, and were ready to scale
the Trenches and enter in at the Ports. Then followed the Ianizaries, as their
seconds, and lastly, the Spahies and Chawses on Horseback, who by their
bravery made themselves sure of the entrance, for the truth is we gave ground,
and lost many men: For they pressed so thick upon us, that our shot did no
good, and we came to handy blows within our own Trenches, till certain
Cossacks on that quarter, and Masters of Pole on ours, finding the Tartars
disordered and disarmed, rushed upon them with fury, that they were driven as
fast back again, as they came in, and in a manner bare the Ianizaries down,
and pusled them much with their violence: yet notwithstanstanding fresh men
were still sent forwar, d who with a strange pertinacity, and unchangeable
valor, continued till Sunset in the expugnation: so that in my conscience, if
they had been Armed, and disciplined after the manner of the warlike Nations
of Europe, they had made a shrewde adventure, and opened a gap of entrance into
our Country, and then (God knows) whether this inundation would have run.
For you see, when raging Seas beat upon the banks of low grounds, if they
prevail in bearing them before them, whole Countries are swallowed up in the
Vast paunch of the Ocean: But the same God, that puts a hook in the nostrils
of Leuiatham, and binds Bebemoth with a chain, set a limitation for these
raging Mahumetans, and furious and barbarous Tartarians, over which they should
not pass at this time.

For although they come with resolution to force our Trenches, and so to lay
the way open to ouerlooke those fields of Bogdonia with a curious eye, and put
it thus to a brave trial, dividing themselves in many Troops to take
advantage of our weakness, and shrinking in this tempestuous storm, yet (God
bethanked) with our accustomed constancy we kept our ground, and though with
some loss constrained them to let go the hold they had, and in the end with a
great shame and a greater slaughter, they hid their heads within their own
hedges: yea, they that ever scorned to quarter themselves within Ditches, and
for their infinite multitudes (with desire of expedition) would never consent
to cast up a Trench, were now compelled to think upon security, and have a
retiring place to go too as a refuge.

The 29. of September, there was great silence amongst them, and a messenger
came for intermission a while, that they might bury their Dead, which was a
work indeed reciprocal between us, and so the time was spent in clearing the
way of the dead Carcasses between our Camps, which being a full mile broad,
lay all be-spred with dead bodies, wherein we also had a share, and the same
cause of setting ourselves on work: For many Tartars had conuaied themselves
over the River, and taking advantage of our encounter, thought we had left the
backside of our Camp, as it were naked and undefended, but when they came,
they found the Carts, Wagons, and Carriages, so strongly to Barricado it, that
they thought it in vain to hazard themselves, and so returned disappointed:
yet because they would be doing, they threw wildfire amongst the carriages,
and put the Cattle in a great fear, whose roarings and bellowings amazed us
much, and in a manner begged relief at our hands, so that we thought it meet
to send out certain Troops of Horse, who fell upon them so opportunely, that
they let in 200. Polaxes amongst them, yea the very Pyoners came with their
Pixes and hutches, and played their parts like men and Soldiers: So that in
the end we compelled them to swim over the River back again.

The next day being the 30. of September, certain fugitives came unto us, and
many Captives of our own Contrymen, who assured us that the Turks lost in
that Conflict 3000. men, besides those which the Tartars left behind on the
other side of the River: we lost outright besides the wounded 300. amongst
whom was one Captain of account, and two of the Princes Guard, who were well
esteemed by him: But such was the fear of this mischief, and appearance of
danger, that many indeed fled into Poland with heavy news of an overthrow, so
that when rumor was once a running, it immitated a ball of Snow, which by
often rolling grows greater and greater, and in the end consumes like a Ball
of snow, when the sun of Truth dissoluech it into vapors, and consumes it
to nothing with the heat of his reflixure.

The same day was a Council of War, and when we saw, that their resolution
was to ouer-run us, and that if by any means we should fail in opposition,
there would here be made an entrance into our Country indeed, when we also
understood they were as willing to the peace as our selves, so it might be of
our first seeking, we concluded to make the adventure, and temper the potion,
which might cure the burning fever of our disquiet: and so the Lord
Castellanus Belrenn, and the Lord Palatinadus Lublinnen, were appointed
Commissioners to tractate with the Turks about Articles of Peace, and
cessation of Hostility: these had for their attendants 20. of the best
Gentlemen of our Camp, and the best furnished, besides servants with provision
of necessaries, if they should fail in their Ambassie, and find, a contrary
doggednes in their enemies.

By that time the Trumpets had given warning of their access, and that they
approached very near the Turks Camp 200. Spahies and Chawses on Horseback
with Velvet Gowns, rich silver Maces, and brave Turbanes, came to entertain
them, and bring them by way of conduction through the first Guard of
Ianizaries, and so through many troops of Horse, and field Pieces mounted on
delicate Carriages, till they came to the Tent of the Viceer, who welcomed him
in his Masters behalf: but according to former custom he must attend a
while, ere he could have Answer from the Grand Signeur himself, and
peradventure not speak with him at all: For you must know, that howeuer they
were glad of composition, yet the Turk would not discover any inclination to
Peace, but if he did condescend, it was merely out of Heroyick compassion, not
any necessity of his part: For during the time of the treaty, the Hostility
continued, and diverse excursions had the effect of furious encounters and
bloody skirmishes.

The first of October, the Lord Koskakorffskij returned by night with all his
Company and provision safe to our Camp, having escaped many dangers and
conflicts with the Tartars, who being acquainted with this purpose and Journey,
lay in wait to intercept his return: For thus it was, provision failing in
our Camp, and many necessaries wanting because the Enemy had blocked up diverse
passages and Rivers, whereby the inhabitants could not bring in provision, as
they were accustomed, it was concluded to send the Lord Koskakorffskij with
Captain Visnen to the Town Camenecen, with a sufficient conuoy for provision
and victual; who some 8. days before took his Journey, which was not yet so
covertly done, but both Turks and Tartars were acquainted with the same,
apprehending that we must needs be in some distress, and that our wants were
to be supplied from his endeauours in procuring new provision, and therefore
advanced a strong Battalion with many shot on foot, and diverse field Pieces to
intercept his return, and so lay between the Town and our Camp, being not
15. nail a sunder: they took up much ground, and were dispersed in many
places, yea many times resolved to set upon the Town it self, and if they
could to take the spoil of the same but it was too strong for them, and so
they contented themselves in the expectation of this booty, and the return of
the Polonians to the Camp.

When the Town saw the Fields thus ouerspred with Tartars, and that they
were so well appointed to intercept the Carriages, they fortefied themselves
the stronger, and yet meant not to keep themselves within their Walls,
considering the necessity of releeuing their Camp: but again understanding
that they lay upon every passage, and must hazard the whole Conuoy with the
provision in the interception: the Lord Koskakorffskij, with the other
Captains, thought it best to put a trick upon their Enemies, and deceive them
if they could by a petty Stratagem, which they thus effected: When all things
were ready for their return within Eight days after their departure from the
Camp, they set forward back again, with many Wagons of Wine and Corn, and
so issued out with certain Troops well appointed, whom they flancked with
light Wagons full of Straw, and Hay, yet not so full but they went in a
manner as fast as the Horse, which when the Tartars perceived, they brought up
their Pieces and came forward with their shot, to dis-rancke these Carts,
verily supposing the maine booty was in the midst of the troops: but the
Carts went so fast, and the Horse upon the trot, that they were quickly from
the shot of their Ordinance, and made the Tartars weary to follow them: yet as
they were instructed they made diverse stands, as if the Wagons meant to take
some rest, and then as the Tartars approached they would trot away again, and
thus they continued till night: by which time the Tartars were quickly drawn
from the Town, and thought it work enough to secure the field Pieces from
surprising: When night came, then issued out the Lord Koskakorffskij with the
main Conuoy indeed, which consisted of Corn, Oil, Wine, Honey, and Cattle,
and went a clean contrary way unknown to the Enemy, though somewhat about to
a Town called Sarno Kouonicie, where he was acco^modated to the River of
Ister, and from whence he came to the Camp, as you have heard in safety and
good order: yet not without some opposition, though far from loss and
discomfiture: For by that time the Tartars knew how they were deceived, which
they did by light Horsemen sent of purpose by the Polonians, to divert them
from following those troops that issued out of Cameneces by day too far,
they sent word to the Turks of the deceit, and they exasperated with very
rage, ran down in whole Companies to beset the River on both sides, and
brought their Ordinance to play upon the Boats, who kept the stream, but the
most were passed by ere they came; and the rest kept the Channel, which was
here so broad, that the Ordinance played on the Banckes and could not do them
much harm: Yet did the Turks follow them as far as our Trenches, but we
having certain Towers well fortefied on both sides the River, played out of
them so violently, that we cut off some of them in their speedines, and those
who were within reach of the shot of our Trenches, were feign to recoyle, and
so the Turks and Tartars returned with great sorrow on all sides, to be thus
disappointed, and we entertained our friends with joy on every side to be thus
relieved.

The same day before Sunsetting, Ambassadors came to our Noble Prince from the
Cossackes, inhabiting the shore of the Black sea by the mouth of Volga, and
those Rivers that power themselves as it were into the lap of Moeotis Palus,
and those borders of Russia: The sum of their Ambascy was, that they had
raised an Army of 20000. in defense of the Christians, against either Turk and
Tartar, or any other Enemy, which shall blaspheme their Religion; they were
armed and paid and within a days march of the Camp: whether they were
entertained by the Prince or no? Let all Princes judge, who know the benefit of
Auxiliary forces and friendly supplies, coming opportunely, and in case of
necessity, whether the news was welcome? let a wounded and distressed person
judge who is pulled out of a ditch from staruing and brought to good fires and
better lodging: whether we made use of their company and coadiutement, let him
judge, that being ouermatched with raging adversaries, is on a sudden supplied
with worthy seconds, who venture their lives in his defense: In a word word
whether the Turks understanding of their approach: were not a little troubled,
considering they had been so often affronted already: let them judge that
understand the nature of Conflicts, and the condition of supplies, though it
be but in Ambuscadoes, which have many times turned back, failing and
discomfitted Troops, and in a new trial recovered the victory.

word whether the Turks understanding of their

The second of October, we took some Prisoners, and many came unto us of
their own accord; yea, diverse Captives Christians found away to escape, and
deliver themselves from the Turkish slavery and bondage, and be united again
to the Love and Obedience of their mother Country, who all confidently
affirmed, that the Turks were weary of the War, and the Tartars cried out of
the walled Towns, fortefied Trenches, mounted Ordinance, arming Corslets, long
Pikes, and other Warlike preparation, contrary to their barbarous and Savage
nakedness, and yet did they not desist from their spoils, and uncivil
forraging of the Country, especially if they could upon any advantage, either
set upon us, or surprise us: but yet we had no such advertisement from our
Commissioners, nor durst disbandy our selves upon any hopes, whatsoever: Only
this I will be bold to affirm, that if the Turks did now desire a Peace
with us, he will not be so forward to proclaim War against us hereafter,
or infrindge the Conditions, when they be once ratified.

From the third of October, to the ninth, the time was spent in disputing about
the peace: For the Hospodar of Walachia, with many Princes of Seruia and
Bulgaria, intruded themselves, and desired the Viceers and Bashawes of the
Turk to be included in the conditions. Here some will have the King of Poland
to repair into the Camp: some again will have him to come in with the Army
of Cossacks, that came from Volga and the black Sea: some will have his
Standard royal to be advanced in the Army, before he came in person: some will
have him secretly to come in, without any bravery or ostentation: howsoever it
be; this is sure, that he was neither mentioned, nor publicly seen, until
the Treaty of Peace, and his marching to Leopolis, wherein likewise I find
some discrepancy about the time, which may be the mistaking of stilo nouo, and
stilo antiquo, or else the error consisted in the setting down a general
rising, when yet most part of the Army remained in the Trenches, after the King
was departed, as you shall hear hereafter: howsoever; I find no variation for
the substance of matter, nor in truth any great matter after the peace to
variate about, and so to the purpose.

The ninth of October, the peace was concluded after the old conditions, and
ratifications with the accustomed manner of proceedings, nor was there any
manner of foederation left out, which might serve to glorify the
Commonwealths on either side: From whence I only observe, that by this
means, this insulting Enemy, who a little before, or if you will the Spring of
the year, threatened fire and sword, and was so far from any conditions of
amity, that he proclaimed the deuastation of our Country, and would have no
denial, but utter subjection, tribute, and slavish obedience, by the force of
Arms, saw now the staff of his mightiness broken a pieces; and that in a
manner by compulsion, he must make a peace with an inferior Prince: and when?
when we stood in need of provision, wanted powder, and shot, saw a returdance
in such troops and payments of money, as were promised by many Christian
Princes, had our Commonwealth turmoyled with the Wars of Liuonia, and our
selves formerly wearied with many convulsions, now set upon afresh with the
only Enemies of Christendom, the great Turk, and barbarous Tartar: but this
God can do, and this God for us, and the same God will (I hope) continue his
mercy toward us.

The 11. of October, the Emperor of Turks sent unto his Majesty a Messenger
with these instructions, that we should first raise our Camp, and depart out of
Walachia, a Province subject and tributary to him, which by no meane^ we would
agree unto, proiecting altogether the dignity of the Kingdom, and the
commodiousnesse of the Army, both which might have been impaired, nay all
quite overthrown, if while we were pusled thus in rising; either the Turks
breaking their covenants, might fall upon us; or ouer-taking us in the Plains,
might press upon us with the greater number, and unprovided. Whereupon the
Turk leaving the standing Bridge, which he made over the River, removed his
Camp some half mile backwarder, giving us leave to make use of the Bridge,
either for carriages too and fro, or our orderly marches: but yet we stirred
not for all this: no, though the Turk stayed two days in that place;
insomuch, that we had recourse one to another, and took a liberty to flatter
one another with formal welcomes, feasting, and kind embraces, as is the
custom of reconciled friends, or if you will protected Enemies.

The 12. of October, the Grand Signieur marched five mile further, to the River
surnamed Prath, and there settled his whole Army: The same day we disposed of
our Ordnance in Carts made of purpose, and took the benefit of the Turks
Bridge, for the easier accommodating our selves, as you have heard: yet was our
King on foot, and had marched some few days before toward Leopolis, giving us
directions not to stir, till the time appointed: For the Tartars were not yet
appeased, but continued their accustomed manner of thefts and robberies, both
in burning of Villages, and meeting with as naked men as themselves; so that
when we departed indeed, we went very strong, sending our Munition and
Cariages, two days before we threw down our Trenches; where-about, also there
was some disputing, whether we should level them with the ground or no: for
they seemed a good refuge, if occasion served to retire unto.

The 13. of October, the Turks removed again a little beyond the River of
Prath, and encamped themselves three mile further. The same day our illustrious
Prince continuing still with the maine Army, arose at once, and marched to the
further side of Ister over the Turks Bridge, by a Town called Zaranie, in the
Province of Checinen, and in the field that belonged to the Castle, where the
Prince took up his lodging, leaving the Lord Lermunth, and all the Germane
Coherts to attend the Cariages and Carts, and safe conduct the Artillery to the
places appointed: For there were many straglers of the Tartars, and Out-lopers
of the Seruians and Walachians, that lay in wait for robberies, and spoils,
neither sparing us, nor the Turks themselves, if they could ouer-master
either, and so were no better then professed Thieves: and therefore was this
order taken in our marches, not to be circumuented, or made a spoil of in the
breaking up of a Camp.

All the next day, being the 14. of October, we tarried at Zaranie, till the
Cariages came together, which the day following, being the 15. we sent very
early to Camenicen, whether we also approached with the maine Troops by Sun
set. But the Cossacks took another way, having many promises of gratification,
both from the Turk and our selves, such was their valor, deserving
commemoration: such were their enterprises compelling acknowledgement. That
night the Prince lodged in the Castle: and the next day the Commissioners
returned with the Articles of agreement, and many Honorable persons presented
themselves, who were severally welcomed as Actors on the former stage of
War, and turmoile, and lovers of their Country, for whose sakes, as you have
heard, they adventured both estates and persons, and were ready to power out
their bloods, as they named it, for the cross of Christ.

After the serious matters were debated, the Ambassadors dismissed, and the
affairs settled, they had some time to talk of other business, and amongst the
rest of the Turks disposition, concerning whom one of the Basshawes had
discovered to the Polonians, while they were about their tractate of peace: how
irksome and distasting it was to the young Emperor, who many times in a
frantic manner would excruciate and torment himself with actions of
distemperature, as throwing of his Turbane, beating his breast, and kicking his
very Basshawes, who durst not reply, but were subject to a very slavish
prostitution, and then would he fall to weeping, and wringing his hands to
think upon his inauspitious actions, and unfortunate attempts, remembering two
especial times: one when with seven thousand of our Army, we set upon 10000.
Turks, who made a brave salley on our Trenches, but were beaten back with
violence to their own homes, at which he so stormed, that he called them
Slaves, Vagabonds, and idle; as if they had played the Traitors of purpose to
eclipse his glory, and obumbrate his renown.

Another: when the Cossacks sallyed upon them, and slew so many of the Tartars,
that they were weary of killing, and so returned with a great prey and spoil
into their own quarters. But of all that fatal day, the 18. of September
troubled and tormented him, when he resolved and set up his rest to overrun
us at once, and came forward with such impetuosity, that we feared our selves,
had not God fought for us, and turned them back with a great slaughter: yea,
such was our loss, and the doubtfulnesse of the victory, that all Europe rang
with our overthrow: and in Hungary it was reported, how he was come as far as
Sendomiria and Cracouia; but (God be thanked) it fell out otherwise, and as now
the tale is told, a strange accident affirghted them all, which we knew not
then, nor do we now presume upon, either as our deserving, or cause of
preservation.

The same day, an Earthquake chanced in the Turks Camp, in such a fearful
and palpable manner, that the whole Army ran out of their Tents, leaving the
Emperor with some certain Chamberers and Ianizaries alone in his: who on a
sudden demanded; what was become of his Army? to whom it was answered, That
part were gone upon a Camisado on the Polonians, and part were ran out as
amazed at the Earthquake. And part, now the curse of Mahomet part them, said
he: What do I here to be a scorn to you all, and a derision to posterity?
With that he snatched at a Semiter, and whether he meant to strike at them, or
dispatch himself, they could not tell. But thus prevented, he fell groueling
on the ground, and up again with a distempred countenance, and wringing his
hands: wherein his distemperature moved commiseration, and they all stood
amazed to see 14. years so apprehensiue to distinguish between glory and
shame: but were confounded altogether to hear him utter these words, and vent
out a passion in such an heroic manner.

Oh God! that have given us bread, and enlarged our Empire with the territories
of Jews, Christians, and Kingdoms beside? that have made the house of Othoman
a scourge and terror to all Nations, and enlarged our renown before any
Prince under the Sun: that have given us a Prophet, and a Law, whereby our
Alcharon is without opposition: that have made our sacra porta a wonder in
nature, and advanced our great City on a hill of eminency, that the Nations
may call Stanbole beautiful, and come from a far to behold our Seralio. But
what shall become of all this? Shall my youth, temerity, cowardice, or
misfortune, add a fatal period to this glory, or all my Ancestors victories
wrapped up in the Cipres chests of my destiny, and ominous proceedings? Shall
all these Kingdoms resume a new courage of reuolting, as if the Mahumetane
Empire were now at the highest, and my disastrous childishness the discouerer
of the secret? Shall Othomans ashes be metamorphozed into some horrid shape, to
exprobrate my pufillanimity, and tell me to my face, I am more worthy of a rod
then a Scepter? Shall Mahomet come from Paradise, and assure me, the gates shall
be in the in the inside against me, for abusing the trust committed to me, and
playing the suckling, when I was to fight his battles in the field! Oh what
an excruciation is this? Have all my Predicessors done something in the world
as an addition of honor, and enlargement of their fame, save only my self,
who am now so far from doing of any thing worthy the least report; that in
steed of memorable actions and heroic attempts, I must return with shame and
discomfiture: nay, as they tell me, make a peace with a petty Prince and
Province, when my Predicessours never pitched their Tents, nor advanced the
Standarts of our Cressant: but had all the Princes of Europe with the wings of
the wind, to fly in their faces, and yet to no purpose. And now, and now: am
I borne to shame and confusion? Oh God! Oh Mahomet, shall it be thus?

To this, or the like purpose was that day spent by the young Prince, till at
last, as you see the upper streams of a River follow one another, mischief
att^nded mischief, and the cries of wounded men assured him, there was news
of another slaughter to torment him; then grew he so mad indeed, that no body
durst come in his sight, had not the Musty and some Doctors of the Law leuiated
this phrenzie with honest discourse; and from example, made a Cataplasme as it
were for his sore: telling him the story of Bajazet, whom Tamberlaine bound in
chains, and of Soliman the magnificent, who after many glorious victories, saw
the malice of a woman to destroy his son Mustapha, and the rest of his
family: and of many others who had as great touches of grieuances as men were
were subject unto, and either bear them out bravely with the scorn of
disquiet, or recovered their renownes with a new industry, that was shrinking
from them, by giving way to fear or impatience: and therefore it is wisdom
and magnanimity to put in practice the best examples, and of all other things
to yield to opportunity, as for the peace now to be considered on: There was no
disparagement to his Honor, and the greatest Monarchs in the world have
yielded to necessity in such constraints. Again, Fortune was not always
disposed to be waaton, nor would at all times attend the chariot of War:
therefore it was best yielding a little to time, especially now, when warlike
Nations had learned this discipline, to enclose an Army within Trenches, and
Pallisadoes, that durst not endure the fury of a battail^, nor the violence of
such forces, as were sure to make their way in the open fields. Besides,
experience had discovered this secret, that a well fortified Town was now
longer a winning and battering, then a whole Province in times past in
ouer-running and conquering.

In this manner, they pacified the young Prince, and prepared him against all
manner of ominous accidents: so that when the Treaty of Peace came in deed, the
Commissioners proceeded, as you have heard, and not only e^fected that, which
they went for: but returned with sufficient reward, and equal acceptance,
relating the matter as it chanced, and certifying our Prince with the whole
discourse, while he was resident at Camenices.

Thus far gentle Reader, has one Letter brought me, and the business, which
being in a high Latin phrase, and a Polish Character does warrant, it came
from some Gentleman of quality, or Soldier of account, or both in one man, who
was sure an actor in the same: and herein I have not failed in any substance
of matter, except in some circumstance of time, or Ortography of proper names,
mistaking a Z for an L, or an s for an r, with such like, etc. which such, as
know the Country, may easily mend; and such as know not, may yet understand
the truth of the business, without taking exceptions at the accent of proper
places, only I must confess I find not the word Rex in all the Letter, but
at the latter end: only illusrissimus Princeps is often named, which whether
it mean the Father or Son, I leave it to him that can judge by the coherence
of the sentences, and application of the divisions: what is done, is merely
for thy satisfaction; and what is to be done, will afford you the like
pleasure: For in both, you may see the mercy of a great God, and the vanity of
a presumptuous man: the one can pull down the proud, and advance the humble
and weak: the other must confess the changes of mortality, and alteration of
humane condition: or knock his knees together with fear and trembling, when
with Belshasher he sees the hand writing on the wall. Thus did the Assirian
Monarch banquet in the bounds of the Sanctuary, and that in security, when yet
the same night the Medes and Persians besieged Babylon, and he was betrayed
into his Enemies hands with the loss of his life, and Kingdom. And thus did
the great Turk threaten Poland, as hoping thereby to make a way into Europe,
and the Northern Seas, when yet within three months he was utterly
disappointed, and compelled to entertain a Peace, when in a youthful iollity
his heart scorned to entertain any thing but revenge or ambitious designs.
Now the God of all blessings make us thankful for so great a mercy, that his
benefits be not bestowed in vain, nor we the sons of men more stupid and
ungrateful, then the bruit beasts, that acknowledge his kindness, and
everlasting goodness.

I have also (gentle Reader) another Letter for thee, which depends immediately
upon the former, sorting in every thing to the truth: but that I find a little
discrepancy in the rising of the Camp, which either may be mistaken by the
difference of stilo nouo, and antiquo, or by the Kings going to Leopolis,
before the maine Camps brake up, and the Tartars were absolutely appeaz'd, or
drawn away by the Grand Signieur. I find it translated to my hand, and
written from Leopolis to some man of Honor else where: but it has neither
date, nor superscription: no, nor the Author has subscribed his name; at which
I do not wonder, because it is but a Copy, nor would have thee wonder: For it
is a common thing in Letters of news and occurrences, wherein all men would be
glad to participate their secrets for the common good, but not publish the
Authors for fear of private traducing: you shall have it therefore, as I find
it; and when you have read it, then judge whether it be worth the publishing or
no. It thus begins.

The Copy of a Letter written from LEOPOLIS.
Gracious and Honorable Lord:
THE fourth of October, we departed from Lublinn, from whence I signified the
present Occurrents, and having now exposed our selves to a new journey, we
likewise anew disposed the order of our marches: For although the peace was
concluded, yet the tidings of the Tartars and Valachians approches increased,
who being not withdrawn out of the field, would not withdraw themselves from
their beastly manner of spoils, robberies, rapes, and cruelty: Wherefore to
prevent their reuenges, and secure our selves, the Troops were thus
marshalled. First, certain Cornets of Horsemen, and Scowt-Masters were sent
out; then the Vantguard with a Battalion on foot: then the Kings Majesty with
his houshold-seruants, and the Banner impressed the Arms royal; to wit, a
white Eagle with a white cross divided, and upon the same tecum et pro te.
This Ensign consisting of five hundred, was gathered at the charges of
voluntary Courtiers, and by them exquisitely set out and ordered. After these,
immediately followed the Kings Majesty, with a Troop of three hundred Dutch
Horse, being his Guard: then came such Carriages as belonged to the King, and
then such as belonged to the Soldiers: And last of all followed the rear,
which consisted most of Masters of Pole. The sixth day we came to Zamoschia,
where there adhaered unto us about six thousand Dutch Horsemen, whose
Colonel was the Palatine of Marcinburg, and six thousand Foot under the
conduct of Colonel Arnhem: so that thus strengthened, we marched with greater
safety, yet not altogether without peril, until we came to Leopolis. For on
the one side we saw the Country on fire, a most certain Character of the
Tartars impression, who burned all before them, and we had now attained unto
their ashes: on the other side, we might easily see many straggling Seruians,
and Bulgarians, who as the Tartars delighted in nothing, but unjustifiable
Robberies, in which manner for all the Turks proclamation they continued, till
they were quite retired home.

The 8. of October, we lodged all night in a little Town, which had been burnt
by the Tartars called Podlitez, and from thence determined the next day to go
forward: but fear ceased upon the Vauntgard, by reason the Scowts returned
with news, that our Wagons were surprised, and the noise went, they were
ransackt by the Tartars: but thanks be to God, it proved a false Alarm: only
some 4000. Tartars, and other of those Nations appeared with a warlike
countenance, and might have been suspected to take advantage of our straglers:
but seeing us so strong, and so well ordered, they gave us leave to go
forward, and we left them to their savage and unnatural immanity.

The day following, a Council was called in a little Town called Kimerton,
and for as much as the maine body of the Tartars Army, was but three mile
distant from us, and that having done so well all this while, we would be
loath to make a shuffling end at the parting: we there encamped our selves, and
abode a whole day, and then taking the neighboring people into our custody, we
marched forward toward Leopolis, and having the twelfth of October gained the
sight of the City, every man was cheared, and solemnly praised God for their
former deliverance. There came forth many of the Gentility to salute and
receive the King: and after them followed multitudes of people: an old custom
to applaud the action of Conquerors, or welcome such Princes, who else would be
their own caruers. It was verily worth the seeing: For the King never rode
with such pomp and confluence into any City; and because it was remarkable,
and worthy of memory, I will hereafter compile it into a larger discourse, and
send it your Honor. In the mean time, to satisfy those that desire to know
the present estate of our affairs, I will briefly make a summary collection,
and intimate our deliverances, as they chanced.

Beyond all expectation a salvation is befalne us: For we are released from
the extremest peril whereinto we were fallen, not by our own diligence and
power, but by the special providence of God, who has done great wonders for
us. Behold our matters were at the point of loss, our Soldiers being wearied
and tired with Turkish assaults: our powder and Munition failed our people,
tasted of hunger and and wants. Kotkouite Palatine of the Wild, and General
of the Army died in the Camp: our Prince fell sick and sadded our hearts, and
many other inconveniences besides the slaughters of our men, threatened our
ruin, and utter subversion. But behold on a sudden how comfort appeared:
about the 2. of October a treaty of Peace was offered, and accepted by the
Turk, for which purpose we were contented to depute certain Commissioners,
who were accordingly entertained and admitted into the Turks Camp, to wit the
Castellan of Belsens, and the Palatine of Lublines, who went roundly to work,
but after the Turkish manner they stood upon high terms of ostentation,
until some, who stood in Tractalion with them, mittigated the heavy imposed
conditions, which continued until the 8. of October. In fine, the next day I
know not by what special working of God, the Turk casting a side all the
propounded Conditions, and interiected cauils, accepted the Pacta antiqua,
which also was on both sides confirmed and ratefied: Then were our
Commissioners admitted to the Emperors presence, and kindly received and
honored with guiftes.

He also sent unto the Illustrious Prince Vladislaus, a living Elephant with
many other things, who again regratulated him with Dogs, and certain payres
of hand Guns, made in the Low Countries, and so the Peace was published, and
the Articles brought to the King to Leopolis, the Camp remaining yet firm,
and the Cossackes continuing in their quarters.

At last the Turk retired his Army, and diuerted the Tartars, who all this
while spoiled and burned the Country, he also promised great gifts to the
Cossackes, which should hereafter be sent by Legations, and whatsoever was
equally demanded, was on the Turks part most Princely granted; all which
points considered, makes this matter almost incredible: For the like is not
found in the Turkish Histories, and in especial, that the Emperor in person
being in an expedition of such preparation, should condescend to such Articles
of Peace, and be contented to return home frustrated and disappoined.

But these be Gods secrets to preserve us, to the end that Christendom should
not by our overthrow, be further infested with Turkish Armies. For questionles
if we had failed either in our Camp, or incounters, he had passed without
control, and the plaint Country would quickly have been overrun by their
multitudes, and outrageous Tartars who thought upon nothing but ruin and
destruction: what should I insist more upon this matter? great Peace has
embraced us, and comfort lighted upon our heads unlooked for: Our Camp shall
be broken up, and we daily expect the Turks Legate, for whom me Illustrious
Prince Vladislaus tarries, we as suppose to conduct him to the King, who will
abide 8. days at Leopolis to give order for the discharge of the Soldiers,
and settling of other matters behoofefull, partly for these Provinces, partly
for the good of Moldauia, and Podolia, with those of Bogdonia, who are all
included in the Articles.

After the dispatch of these affairs, the King intends to return to Warsaw,
as receiving Letters out of Sweden, which are not altogether pleasing unto him:
In the mean while the Gentlemen and Masters are dismissed, and many Soldiers,
who are yet in the expedition have order to return, and a general
Commandment is gone out to have Prayers and Processions in every Church, yea
I am sure by to that time the news came Cracow, and other Cities, they will
not spare for Bonfiers, and make a general rejoicing in every place.

I know that these things will be acceptable tidings to your Honor, the
event of other causes I will hereafter, signify. Send the Conditions of the
Peace, or if you will the Articles of agreement, and diligently write what else
shall be worth the relating, as I encounter with such, as come out of the
Camp: All I desire now is, that this my diligence may be commended, and
dedicated unto your gracious favor: I am promised a discourse of the departure
of the Tartars, and how they took their leaves of the Gran Seigneurs, when it
comes it shall salute you with speed, in the mean while Gracious Lord, if I
rest in your Favor, I have my desire.

Poland, Sul. Dato 9.th of October, 1621. Stilo Nouo.
1. INprimis, Stanislaw Salishowskis Secretarius Regius, shall ex nunc go with
the Turkish Emperor unto Constantinople, there to attend the coming of a
great Ambassador, which the Kings Majesty shall send, and the said Ambassador
shall always remain at the Sacra Porta, like the Ambassadors of other
Christian Potentates: and in this respect a principal Chawse shall presently
be dispatched to go with our Commissioners unto his Majesty, and a great
Turkish Ambassador follow, to the end that Pacta antiqua abvtraque part, which
are all recorded, may be sworn unto, confirmed, and ratefied.

2. To the end that the Cossacks may not henceforth damnifie the Turkish
Empire: both sides bind themselves to prevent the same: and so often as the
Turkish Emperor in this respect shall have cause to require the administration
of Justice, the Kings Majesty shall be obliged to perform the same. In which
respect the Tartars likewise shall abstain from all manner of hostile
invasions against the Kingdom, as in more especial the Turkish Emperor has
undertaken to hinder their passage at Ochkora, and if beyond expectation either
part shall be damnified, by the other restitution shall be made, and the
Tartars punished: but in the Vast and undivided Wilderness, until their
equal division and limitation follow, it shall be free for the Tartars and
Cossackes to Hunt wild Beasts, and it shall no whit impeach the Pacta Convent:
although in this respect they may happen to fall together by the ears, and
seek their reuenges.

3. When the Tartar Chrim shall go upon any expedition to serve the Turkish
Emperor, he shall not touch or damnifie his Majesty's Lands, and to the end
that in this case either may know his bounds there shall be Commissioners ex
vtraque part ordained, and by them certain limits appointed, as also
Overseers for the black Sea, and those rouers.

4. Respublicae Pol^ni^a, yields and accords henceforth to pay unto the
Tartar the accustomed Tribute which he shall demand by his Ambassadors, and
in this respect the Hospodar of Walachia, shall always be an understanding
peaceable man, and a Christian, and shall help to keep the Tartars in Office,
and government, that they attempt nothing Contra pacta, or if they do to
receive punishment, according to the nature of the offense and trial: And if
his Majesty shall have such occasion, then shall the Tartars assist him against
his enemies: In a word, they shall be obliged to serve the Kingdom.

5. It is granted, that Chochim shall be delivered unto the Hospodar of
Walachia, with all the appurtenances formerly belonging to that Fort.

6. Unto all those which are the Turks enemies, shall the King and Kingdom of
Poland, be likewise Enemies, and a friend unto all his Friends: and in the same
manner shall the Turkish Emperor be obliged to the Crown of Poland.

7. All these Conditions were sworn by the said Commissioners, and they were
written in Polish, Turkish, and Latin, and the following great Ambassadors in
like manner facta renouatione on both parts shall confirm the same, and
continue the maintaining of the ancient Pacta by their Oaths: They were also
under written by the Viceer of the Army of Turks, the Mufty, and a Doctor of
Law: but on our side, by Stanislane Zorarmiski, Castellan of Belsen, and James
of Sobniski the Palatine, Son of Lubelski, in the name of the Kings Majesty,
and of the General Stanislane Lubomirski, Captain of Zandomir: with the other
Commissioners deputed.

Thus (gentle Reader) thou have likewise the last Letter with the conditions of
peace, as they were then ratified by the Turks, and King of Poles
Commissioners: there were also read in public the old contracts, containing
the limitation of their Kingdoms, and the mentioning their friends and
confederates, with all tributary Provinces, and many other things impertinent
at these times: all which I have omitted to trouble you withal, resolving only
to satisfy you with a plain truth of the end of the War, and to tell you a
wonder in the making the truce: the use is merely to set out the glory of God,
who can turn the frame of heaven about, and bring that to pass with
easiness, which the wisdom of man thinks impossible, and the policy of
Kingdoms determines to contriue another way: and to discredit the
ostentation of Princes, who out of their own presumption can boast of great
matters: but when the cause comes to be decided in the Court of Heaven, they
are laughed to scorn, and a contrary sentence condemns them, as delinquents
to the Majesty of God, and offenders against their own souls and consciences.

Since this, I have also received other Letters amongst the Merchants from
Constantinople, dated the 10. of December, which make mention of the Grand
Signieurs being at Andrinopolis, but is not yet come to the great City: only
the Haga of Ianizaries, and certain Officers of the Seralio are arrived to
prepare the Palace, and cleanse the Town, that both Court and City may be fit
for his entertainment. And amongst the rest, there is one thing most
remarkable, that his Uncle Mustapha, when he was deposed, did Prophecy of this
peace: and in a manner foretold, that the Ottaman Empire was at the highest,
and should no further enlarge the sun, but rather decline, and see their
renown shadowed with malignity of time: But because his Spirit was not
answerable to his greatness, the Ianizaries neglected him: nor his wisdom for
lack of public conversation, as being always kept Prisoner, satisfactory to
the government, he was the sooner put down, and so as yet he remains
vnstrangled, and peradventure unrespected.

There now remains no more, but for the Poles to fortefie their confines, and
stand upon their Guard for all this Contract of amity, and treatice of
purification, considering the fry of Nations, that lie Eastward from them, who
either are enemies to Christian Religion as Idolaters, and Mahumetans: or
indeed of no Religion, as running the violent race of Sauagenes and
beastiallity, all which good care and vigilance will prevent, considering as I
have often said, they are naked men, have no Discipline, and are to seek when
they come to Trenches and Fortifications: Yet for all this good success: and
prosperous event of the War? I would neither have them too presumptuous, or
elated, as though their own Arm of flesh had done it: nor tim^rous or
exanimated though they hear of the Turks preparation against them. For it is
not the sound of 2. or 300000. of men can conquer Countries and Kingdoms, but
the extraordinary valor of well disciplined Soldiers, nor are they likewise
to boast with the Syreans that they can lick up the dust of Samaria, and
transfer the Diadems of Princes at their pleasure, but to know there is a God
of Battles, that made Gideons 300. ouerrunne the Midianites, and will do
wonders for his Church in despite of the watchings of the Dragon: yea I make
no doubt but that the same God, which has delivered Christendom from the
Turks excursions as you have heard, will also deliver the Protestant Princes
from the Popes Curses, and Antichristian threatenings, as you shall shortly see,
And so I end with the Poet: O melibace Deus nobis haec otia faecit,
Namque erit ille mihi semper Deus, illius vram
Saepe tener nostris ad ouilibus imbuet agnus.


FINIS.
