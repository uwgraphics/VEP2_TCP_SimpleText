DELICIOVS ENTERTAINMENTS OF THE SOVLE: WRITTEN BY THE HOLY AND MOST REVEREND
LORD FRANCIS DE SALES, BISHOP AND PRINCE OF GENEVA.

Translated by a Dame of our Ladies of comfort of the order of S. Bennet in
Cambray.

Imprinted at DOVAY, By GHEERART PINSON, vnde the sign of Cuelen. 1632.

CHRISTIAN AND RELIGIOUS READER.
IF in peruseing this translated treatese of sound doctrine and solid
documents, thou meet with some faults (as thou will do with many, both in
the translation and impression) know that the printer was a VVallon, who
understood nothing at all English; and the translatresse a woman, that had not
much skille in the French, but why did she then undertake it? vvilt thou
say, truly for her private employment and instruction; never intending more
then the use of a particular cloister; though God and her superiors have
otherwise disposed of it, and exposed it to the publierk view of the world,
as thou see.

. Sure I am, and can assure the of three things. First, that if thou have the
spirit of the author or the matter, thou will interpret and pardon all
frindly, freely, and fully. Next, That if thou find as much profit in the
perusal of it, as she did that translated it, thou vvilt bless God, and pray
for her.

Thirdly, that if it could be as vvelcome and vvelliked in English, as it was
and is still in French, the printer will not loose his pains in printing it,
nor you in pervsing it: for since the late death of this famous Prelat and
pillar in Gods Church (who was one of the most clear, discreet, svveet and
devout spirits of our age;) it has been published in diverse editions; and is
still exceedingly praised, prized, and practiced; not only by Religious
persons, but also by the best seculars, especially of the devout sex:

For although all be not religious, nor bound to be so perfect as religious
are; yett all are bound to labor for the perfection of christian and solid
virtues, such as are humility of heart, poverty of spirit, purity of
intention, simplicity of affection, conformity of will, custody of heart,
naked charity, and filial confidence, together with a generosity ^f
resolution to please and love God above all, to all which and much more this
little book ^eadeth the by a short, svveet, and secure way.

Jf thou like and love not the INTRODVCTION TO A DEVOVT LIFE, composed by the
^ime Bishop, I should call thy devotion into ^uestion; if thou approve and
applaud it as all truly devout do) thou shall find that his after-borne
fruict is but as it were a sup^ement, or explication thereof in a most ^aine
and perfect manner, descending to par^^culars in the obtaiming of virtues, and
mor^^fication of vices: If some things be pecu^^r to Religious persons, either
leave such (...) them; or apply to thy self with some ^^tle change: all meats
are not for all stomakes, ^r all Doctrines for all dispositions; pervse all,
^^^tize some, pray for the translatresse, and ^^^ise God in all.

If any ill vvillers of Catholic religion, and vvishers of a religious
vocation rome to the ^^vv of this book, they may see the lives; ^^les,
virtues, and customs, of Religious families discipherered without passion or
partiality, and admire with what charity, discretion, devotion, and humility
they pass over the pilgrimage of this mortal and miserable life, sighing
after, and suffernig for eternity: and so leave to detract and deride at that
which they cannot comprehend, much less imitate: And if perchavnce some
scandals arrive amongst them by the means of some vvolue or foxes in
sheepskins, I mean by some fals^ brethren and Apostates, it is not to be
attributed to the Orders and ordination of hol^ Church or Religious
institution, but to the malice of satan and humane frailty, for neue^ yett
since the Church began, was it free from scandals, and false brethren and
Apostat^ nor never will it be until the worlds en^ yett cursed are they that
voluntarily blo^ and kindle the fire of faction or division in t^^ house of
God, or that add sevvell unto it continue it, and blessed are the peace ab^
humble, and innocent spirits that are proou^ and purified ther-in.

. For conclusion, I dare boldly say, t^ whosoever will follovv really and
cordi^ the spirit of this Author, and book; he she live in peace with God,
with his neighbo^ and with himself: he shall taste upon earth how ^vveet God
is in heaven, he shall lead a true Evangelical or rather Angelical life, he
shall ^egin his heaven upon earth, and sail secure, ^mmoueable, quiet, and
content through all he chaunges and chances, storms and tem^estes of this
wavering world, Jesus being ^is Pilot, hope his ancre, faith his light,
so^^tude his cabinet, prayer his provision, ^umility his haven, heaven his
home: fare^vell.

LIVE LORD JESUS IN OUR SOVLES.
THE BISHOP OF GENEVA HIS SPIRITVALL ENTERTAINMENTS.
THE FIRST ENTERTAINMENT
VVHERIN IS DECLARED THE OBLIgation of the constitutions of the visitation of
Our Blessed Lady, and of the qualities of devotion, which the Religious of
the said order oughto have.
TThese co^stitutions, of themselves do in no sort oblige any one under
sin, either mortal or venial: but they are given only for ^^rection and
guide to those of the congregation; ^^t not with standing, if any should
violate ^^em willingly, of purpose, with contempt, or ^ith scandal, as well to
the sisters as to stran^^rs: she should with out doubt committ a ^^eat offense;
for such a person cannot be ex^^pt from fault, who debaseth and deshono^th the
things of God, belieth her profession, overthrows the congregation, and
dissipateth the fruits of good example and sweet savor, which she ought to
produce to wards her neighbor: so that such a voluntary contempt shall in
the end be poursued with some great chastisment from heaven, and especially
with deprivation of the graces and gifts of the holy Ghost, which are
ordinarily taken from them, who abandon their good designs, and quitt the way
into which Almighty God has introduced the^

2. Now the contempt of Constitutions, as also of all other good works, is
known by these considetations following.

That person failleth therein, which through contempt violateth, or omitteth to
execute any ordinance, not only voluntarily, but of deliberate purpose; for if
he violate it in consideratly by oblivion, or surprise of some passion; that i^
another thing: for contempt contains in it* deliberate will, and a
determinate purpose to do that, which it does; where of it follows that the
person, who violateth the ordinance* or disobeyeth through contempt, he not
onel^ disobeyeth, but he will disobey; he does no^ only co^mmitt an act of
disobedience, but h^ does it with intention to disobey: as for example, It is
forbiddden to eat out of the time of meals, a sister eats plummes,
Apricokes* or other fruits; she violateh the Rule and commits an act of
disobedience: now if she eat being allured with the delighte, which she
thinks to receive in it; then she disobeyet^ but not through disobedience,
but through L^ quorousnes; or else she eats, beccause she has the Rule in
little esteem, neither will regard it, nor submitt her self there unto, and
then she disobeyeth through contempt and disobedience.

More over hence it follows, that the party that disobeyeth, by some
allureme^t, enticing, or sudden passion, would gladly be able to content her
passion and not disobey, even at the same time that she, takes pleasure in
matter of eating: for example, she is sorry that it is with disobedience; in
which case disobedience follows or accompanies the work: but in the former,
disobedience precedeth or goes before the actio^, and serves for the cause and
motive of it, even although it be for delicacye; for whosoever eats against a
commandment, consequently or together, commits an act of disobedience;
although if it could be avoided in eatting he would not commit it: even as he
that drin^eth very much, would not willingly become drunk, although in
drinking he makes him ^^lfe drunk. But they who sin through neglect, or
disesteeme of the Rule, and by disobedience; ^hey will and intend the same
disobedience, in ^^ch sort that they do not the work, nor should do it, if
they wear not moved to do it ^y the will and purpose they have to disobey.
^he one then disobeyeth, willing and inten^^ng that to the which disobedience
is joined, ^^e other disobeyeth willing and pourposing the ^^me thing because
disobedience is conjoined ^^er unto: The one encountereth and disobedi^ce, in
the thing she wills, and would be glad ^^t to edcounter it: the other seeks
a^fer dis^^edience and would not do the thing, but ^ith intention to find
disobedience therein. The ^^e says, I disobey because, I entend to eat this
apricoke, which I cannot do but with disobedience: the other says, I eat
it, because I will disobey, wihch I shall do in eating: disobedience and
contempt follows the one, and it conducteth the other:

Now this formal disobedience and contempt of good and holy things, is never
with out some sin at least venial, no not in things which are only
conunsells. Although one is not bound to follow the counsels of perfection,
by the election of other things under any offense: yet may she not therefore by
disesteeme, and contempt refuse them, with out offense. For though we are not
obliged to follow all that is good, yet we ought to honnour and esteem it, and
co^seque^tly we have much more reason not to contemn or set little by it.

More-ouer it follows that she who by contempt violateth the Rule and
constitutions, esteems it unprofitable and vile, which is a very great
presumption and pride: or else peradventure, if she esteem it profitable, yet
for all that, will not submitt her self thereunto: then she breaks her
purpose, with great do^mage of her neighbor, to whom she gives scandal, and
evil example, and she does contrary to her promise made to the company, and
disordereth a devout house; vhich are three grievous faults.

But to the end, it may in some sort be discerned when a person violateth the
Rules of Obedience by contempt, behold here some signs.

1. when as being corrected, she mocketh at it, and has not any repentance.

2. when she perseuereth with out demonstration of any desire or will to amend
her self.

3. when she contesteth, that the Rule or commandment, is not to the purpose.

4 when she endeuoreth to draw others into the same breach, and takes the
fear thereof from them, saying, that it is nothing, and there is no danger,
therein. Yet these signs are not so certain, but they may happen sometimes
for otber causes, as well as that of contempt: for it may happen that a person,
derideth the party, who reprehendeth her; for the little estimation she has of
her; That she perseuereth through infirmity; or that she contesteth out of
despite and choler; or to have companions she debaucheth others, the better to
excuse her disordered b^hauiour Neuertheless^ it is easy to judge by ^he
circumstances, when these things are done by contempt: for in the end shame
ess^nes, impude^cie, and manifest liberty ordinarily follow contempt; and
those who have it in their heart, in fine power it forth at their mouth, saying
(as David notes) who shall control us?

4. I must needs add a word concerning a ^entation, which may arrive upon this
point: that is this, sometimes a person esteems not ^er self to de
disobedient and a libertine when he neglects but one or two Rules, which
^eeme to her of small importance, provided that she observe all the others; But
O good God, who sees not this deceit; considering that what one shall esteem
little, an other will ^uch regard; and contrary. Likewise when (...) a company
one makes no account of one ^ule, the second dispiseth another, the third
another, so the whole frame of Religious discipline, is put out of order. For
whilst tha^ the spirit of man is no otherwise conducted then according to his
inclinations and auersio^s, what happens unto him, but a perpetual
inconstancy, with variety of defects and offenses? yesterday I was joyful
and silence did dislike me; and a tentation did suggest to me that I was Idle
perchance I am melancholy this day, and it will tell me that recreatio^ and
intertaynment are ye^ far more unprofitable; I was yesterday in consolation,
then it did please me to sing: this day I am in desolation and it will
displease me, and s^ of other suth like accidents.

So that whosoever will live perfectly a happy lif^ of necessity he must
accustom himself to live according to reason, to his Rules, an^ Obedience; and
not according to his inclination or auersions; and much to esteem all the
Rule^ and to h^nour them* and cherish them* at sca^ in his Superior will; for
if he neglect one now to morrow he shall contemn another, and furthe^ more the
next day another, and the^ incontine^t^ the bond of duty being brok^n in an
instant a whatsoever vas bound there with, by litt^^ and little will be dispersed
and scaterred ^ broad.

God forbid that any of the daughters of the visitation should straye so far
out of the w^^ of the Love of God, that she loose her sel^ in the contempt of
the Rules by disob^dience, hardness and obstinacy of heart. F^^ what greatter
mischeife or disaster could ha^pen unto her? espetially since there are fe^
particular and proper Rules of the congr^gation, the most part, and almost all
of the being either general good Rules, which they ought and should observe in
their houses, were they in the world, if they will live with any honor,
reputation and fear of God; or else they regard the apparent comelines (or)
decency of a devout house, or the officers them selves in particular.

5. If so be some times there arrive unto them some disgust or auersion from the
constitutions, and Rules of the Congregation: they shall comport themselves in
the same manner, as they are to do about other temptations, correcting the
auersion by reason, and by a good and strong resolution, framed in the
superior part of the soul; attendig till God send them consolation in their
way, and make them to see, (as another Jacob, when he was weary and tired in
his voyage,) that the Rules and method of Life which they have embraced, are
the true ^adder, by which they ought, in guise of the Angel, to mount unto God
by Charity, and to descend into themselves by humility.

But if, with out auersion, it happen unto them to violate the Rules through
infirmity: ^hen they are instantly to humble themselves before God, demand
pardon of him; and re^ewing their resolution of observing the same Rule, they
shall take care, and wach ^boue all, that they enter not into discouragement of
spirit and unquietness; but with new confidence in God, have recourse to his
holy Love.

6. And in regard of violating of the Rule, (which is not done, but by pure
disobedience or by contempt) if they do it by carelessnes, infirmity
tentation, or negligence: then they may and ought to confess it as a venial
sin; or otherwise as a thing, wherein there might have been a venial sin;
for although there be not any kind of sin there in, in virtue of obligation to
the Rule; there may be neuertheless in respect of their negligence carelessnes,
sodaynesse, or other such defects; since it rarely arriueth, that seeing some
good proper for our aduance-ment (and especially if we be called and invited
to do the same) we voluntarily give it over and omit it with out offense; in
so much as such an omission, proceeds no otherwise the^, of neglicence, and
depraved affection, or want of fernon^. And if we must render an account of
those words which are truly idle, how much more for having rendered
unfruitful and unprofitable the call which out Rule gives us for the practice
there of? I have said, It happens rarely not to offend god When wi^^ Leave
undone a good, fit for our adduancement; because it may so fall out, that we
omit it not willingly, or deliberatly; but by oblivion, unwariness, and
subreption; and the^ there is no sin therein, neither little nor great;
unless the thing, which we forget, wear of so great importance that we wear
obliged to hold our selves so attentive, that we do not fall into oblivion
and unwariness; as for exemple, if a sister break silence, because she is not
attentive, that it is time of silence, and therefore she remembers not
he^selfe; for so much as she thinkelth of other things or else she is suprised
with some motion to speak, in the which occasion she shall have saye^ some
thing, before she has well thought to repress it; with out doubt she sins
not: for the ^bseruance of silence is not of so great impor^ance, that they be
obliged to have such an at^ention, that they forgett it not: rather
contra^iewise it is a very good thing in the time of ^^lence to employ
themselves in other pious and ^oly thoughts, and if being attentive to them,
^ne forgett her self to be in time of silence, ^his oblivion proceeding from so
good a cause ^an never be evil, nor consequently, the want ^f silence, which
proceeds there of.

But if she should forgett to serve a sick person, which wear in danger for
want of service, and that this office had been enjoined her, for ^^e which all
reposed on her care: it should be no ^ood excuse for her to say, I thought not
of it, I ^^id not remember my self; no: for the thing ^as of so great
importance, that she ought to be ^ttentiue there unto, not to fail there in;
and he want of this attention may not be excused, in ^^gard of the quallitie of
the thing which does ^eserue and require due attention.

7. It ought to be believed, that according (...) the measure which divine Love
shall make ^rogresse in the souls of the daughters of the ^ongregation, it
will always render them more ^^act, and careful in the observance of their
^onstitutions, although they of them ^lues oblige not under pain of sin
nei^^er mortal nor venial; for if they did obli^^e under pain of death, how
much more ^raitly, should they observe them? Now ^oue is strong as death; then
the attra^^ions of Love are also as powerful to execute resolution, as the
threatenings of death: zeal says the sacred Canticle) is hard and strong as
hell: the Souls then which have zeal, will do^ as much and more in virtue of
the same, the^ they would do for fear of hell. So likewise by the sweet
violence of Love, the daughters of the Congregation will observe so much more
exactly their Rules, God affisting the^, then if they wear obliged under pain
of eternal damnation It sum, they shall have perpetual memory o^ that
which Solomon says in the Proverbs 19. he which keeps the commandment*
gardeth his soul, and he who neglects his way shall die now your way is that
manner of Life, in the which God has placed you. I speak nothing here of the
obligation which we have to the observance of vows: for it is most evident,
tha^ whoseuer absolutely tra^sgresseth the Rule, in the essential vows of
Poverty, Chastity, and obedience, sins mortally, and he should do a^
much breaking enclosure.

8. Let the sisters make a particular Profession to nourish in their hearts an
interior strong an^ generous devotion; I say interior that they hau^ their
wills conform to the good exterior actio^ they shall do, whether they be
little or great^ Let nothing be done out of custom: but by election and
application of the will; and if sometimes the exterior action prevent the
interior affection because of the continual use there of: at least let
affection immediately follow; if before that I incline my self to my
Superior, I have not the interior inclination by an humble election to b^
subject unto her: at least let this election acco^panie, or follow near the
exterior inclination

The fisters of the Congregation have very few Rules for the exterior; few a
usterities; few ce^emonies, short service: let the^ therefore willing^ie and
lovingly accommodate their hearts ^o them, making the exterior to proceed
from ^he interior, and nourishing the interior by ^he exterior, even so as
fire produces ashes, and ashes nourish the fire.

More over this devotion must be strong,

First to support tentations which are never ^anting to them, which will with an
entire heart ^erue God.

Secondly strong to support the variety of spirits which they shall find in
the congregation, which ^s so great a trial for weak spirits that they shall
^arcely encounter any thing more difficult.

Thirdry strong to support each one her own ^mperfections, and not to be
disquieted to see ^er self subject to them: for even as she must ^aue a strong
humility, not to loose courage, but ^o lift up her confidence in God in the
midst of ^er imbecillities; so must she have a powerful ^ourage to entreprise
the correction and ame^dment of them.

Fourthly, strong to fight again h cr imperfectio^s Fifthly strong to conte^ne
the world and iudge^e^ts of the world, which are never wanting to co^^^oll
pious institutes, espetially in the beginning. Sixthly, strong to hold her
self independent of ^ff^ctions, frindships or particular inclinations, ^o the
end she live not according to them; but according to the light of true piety.

Seventhly, strong to hold her self independe^t ^f te^dernesse, sweetnesses,
and co^solatio^s which ^ome unto us as well from God, as from creatures, and not
to permit our selves to be engaged to them.

Again, strong to enterprise a continual war^ against ^ur evil inclinations
humors, habitts and propensions.

In fine it must be generous, not to be astonished or daunted with
difficulties; but rathe^ contrary wr^e increassing her courage by them For (as
S. Bernard says) he is not very valiant whose courage grows not in midst o^
pains and contradictions. Generous to preten^ the most high point of
perfection, notwithstanding all imperfections, and weakness or frailty
sustayning her self by a perfect confidence upon the divine mercy, following
the exampl^ of that soul who said to her beloved: Dravv me we will rume
after thee in the odor of the oyntme^ts: as if she would have said: of my
self I am immouable; but when thou shall draw^ me, I will rume The divine Lover
of our soul leaves us often as it wear sticking in our miseries, to the end
we may know our deliuranc^ comes from him; and when we have it, w^ hold it
dear, as a most precious gift of hi^ bounty. For this cause as generous
devotion never cease to cry unto God, draw me; (...) she never cease from
aspiring, f^o^ hoping, an^ from promising her self courageously to run^ one,
and says, we will run after thee; And w^ ought never to be troubled if at
the first onse^ we run not after our Savior, provided that w^ allwaies say,
draw me, and that we haw the courage for to say: we will run; for although
w^ ru^ne not, it suffices that God assisting we vv^ run. This congregation
not being an assembl^ of perfect persons, no more then other Religion are, but
of persons who^ pretend to perfe^^ themselves: not of persons running, but of
persons who pretend to run; and who for this ^ause learn first to walk a
slow pace, then to ^asten themselves, after to walk more rou^dly, and in fine
to run.

9. This generous devotion conte^neth not any thing: and causes that with out
trouble or ^nquietnesse we see every one to walk, to ^unne, to fly diversely,
according to the diuersi^ies of inspirations, and variety of measures of ^he
divine grace, which every one receaueth. This is an advertisement which the
great Apo^tle S. Paul made to the Romans. 14. one (says ^e) believes he
may eat of all things, the other, which is vveake, eats herbs; Let not
him that eats, despise him which eats not, and ^e that eats not, let
him not judge him that ^ateth. Let every one abound in his sense: he that
eats, eats to our Lord, and he that eats not, eats not to our Lord, and
asvvell the one as the other renders thanks to God. Your Rule does not
command many fastes, nevertheless some for particular necessities may obtain
license to fast more. Let not those that shall fast, despise them that eat,
nor those that eat them who do fast, and even so in all other things, which
are not comanded nor forbidden. Let every one abound in her sense, that is
to say, let every one enjoy, and use her liberty, with out judging and
controlling others, that do not as she does; desiring to have her manner held
to be the best: since it may be, that one eats with as much renunciation of
her own will, as another would fast; and that one tells not his faults by
the same renunciation, by the which another tells the^. Generous devotion
will not have companions in all that she does; but only in her pretentio^,
which is the Glory of God and advancement of her neighbor in the divine Love;
and, provided they walk rightly to that end, she cares not by what way it is;
on co^ditio^ that he which fasteth, fast for God; and he who fasteth not, also
fast not for God, she is wholly satisfied, as well with the one, as with the
other. She will not then draw others to her course, but follows simply,
humbly, and peaceably on her way Yea if it should happen that one should eat
not for God, but by inclination; or that she should not take a disclpline, not
for God, but by a natural auersion; yet for all that, those who do the
contrary exercises shall not judge her; but with out censuring shall gently
and sweetly follow on their way, with out dispising, to the prejudice of the
weak; remembering them selves, that if in these occasions, some incline
perchance to nicenes: their own inclinations and auersio^s also in other
occurrences do perhapps the same; but also those who have such inclinations
and auersions, ought to take great heed, not to utter any words, nor to give
any manner of sign of disgust, that others do better: for it should be a
great impertine^ce in them: but rather considering their imbecility they ought
to regard the better doers with a holy sweet and cordial reverence; for
thereby they may be able to draw as much profitt from their weakness by the
humility that proceeds there of, as the others do gain by their exercises.
If that this point be well understood and well obscrued, it will conserve a
marvelous tranquilly and sweetness in the Congregation. Let Martha be active,
but let her not control Magdalene; Let Magdalene contemplate, but so that
she despise ^ot Martha; for our Lord Will take the cause of ^er that shall be
censured.

But nevertheless if some sisters should have ^uersio^s from pious, good and
approved things, or inclinations to things less pious; if they will ^eleeue
me, they shall use violence, and shall ^esist their auersions, and
inclinatio^s, as much as ^hey shall be able, the better to render themselves ^rue
mistrisses of the^ selves, and to serve God ^y an excellent mortification,
repugning even this their repugna^ce, contradicting their contradictio^
declining from their inclinations, diuerting the^ selves from their auersions,
and in all and by all making the authority of reason to reign, principally
in things, in which they have time to take their resolution: and for
conclusion, they shall endeavor to have a gentle and tractable heart, submisse
and easy to condescend in all lawful things, and to show in every
enterprise, Obedience and Charity; for to resemble the dove, who receaueth,
all the brightness and shinings the sun gives her; Blessed are the pliable
hearts, for they will never break.

10. The daughters of the visitation shall allwaies speak very humbly of their
little congregation, and they shall prefer all others before it, (as touching
honor and precedence) yet neuertheless they shall prefer it before al other,
as touching Love; willingly witnessing, when occasion shall present if self,
how contentdllie they live in this vocation, even so as women ought to prefer
their hushands before all others, not as more honorable, but in affection; so
every one preferrs his country before others in Love, not in esteem; and each
Pilot cherishes more the vessel where in h^ saylleth, the^ there is, although
they be more rich and better furnished. Let us freely avouch tha^ other
Congregations are better, more rich, an^ more excellent; but therefore not more
amiable, or more desirable, or more convenient, for us; since our Lord has
willed this should be our country, our bark; and that our har^ should be
married to this institute, following the speech of him, who being demanded
which was the most delightful resting place, and the best food for the Child,
the breast (said he) and the milk of his mother; for although there are many
more beautiful breasts and better milk, yet for him there is not any more
proper, nor more amiable.

THE SECOND ENTERTAINMENT.
VVherin is demanded, whether we may appear before God whith great
confidence, having whith in our selves the feeling of our misery, and how;
and of the perfect abnegation of our seues.
You demanded of me, most Dear daughters, whether a soul, that has the
feeling of her misery, may present her self before God with a great
confidence? now I answer, that not only the soul, which has the knowl^dg
of, her misery; may have great confidence in God; but also she cannot have
true confidence, unless she have the kenowledg of her misery; for this
^enowledg and confession of our misery intro^uceth us before God; even so all
the great ^ints as Job, David, and others, did begin all ^^eir prayers by the
confession of their misery and indignity; therefore it is a very good thing
^or a person to acknouledg her self poor, vile ^biect and unworthy to appear
in the presence ^f God. This saying, know thy self, so much ^elebrated by
the ancients of former times; al^hough that it extends it self to ^he
knowledge ^f the greatness, and excellency of the soul, that ^t do not abase
and profane it self in things ^nworthy of its nobility: it also extends to
^he knowledge of our indignity, imperfection, and misery. For look how much
more we shall acknowledge our selves to be miserable; so much more shall we
confide in the bounty and mercy of God: for between mercy and misery ^here
is a certain connection so great, that the ^ne cannot be exercised with out the
other. if God had not created man, he had been truly to^ally good; but he had
not been actuallie merciful; for so much as mercy exercises not it self but
^o the miserable. You see then, that how much more we acknowledge our selves
miserable, so much more we have occasion to put our trust in God, since we have
nothing where of to confide in our selves. Distrust of our selves proceeds
from the knowledge of our imperfections: It is good then to distrust our selves.
But to what purpose will it serve us, unless we cast our whole confidence
upon God, and rely upon his mercy? the faults and infidelities that we
co^mitt every day, ought indeed to bring us shame and confusion, when we will
approach near o^ Lord; and so we read, that there have been ho^ souls ( S
Katherin of Sie^ne, and S. Theresa) wh^ when they wear fallen into any fault,
felt exceedin^ great confusion; It is truly very reasonable tha^ having
offended God, we should retire our selue a little by humility. and remain
confounded for having offended a friend only, we are ashamed to approach to
him; but we must not remain there; for these virtues of humility of
abiection and confusion, are mediate virtue by the which we ought to mount to
the union of our soul with God. It would be n^ great matter, to be annihilated
and left naked o^ our selves (the which is done by acts of confusion) if it
wear not to give our selves wholly t^ God: even as S. Paul taught us, vhen he
said unclothe your selves of the old man, and put o^ you the new, for you must
not remain naked but cloth yourselue with God; This little recoyl^ is not made
but to the end the soul may thereby leap forward into God by an act of Lou^
and confidence; for we must not be confounded with Sadness or unquietness; it
is self Lou^ that gives these confusions, by which we ar^ sorry for not being
perfect, not so much for the Love of God, as for the Love of our selves.

Yea although you feel not any such confidence, yet may you not ommitt to make
acts thereof, and say unto our Lord, although, my Lord I have not any confidence
in thee, yet I know thou art my God, that I am wholly thine, and have no other
hope then in thy goodness: and therefore I give my self over quite into thy
hands It is allwaies in our power to make these acts* and albeit we have
difficulty in it, it is not there^^re impossible: and it is in these
occasions, and ^eses difficulties, that we ough to give testimo^ie of our
fidelity to our Lord: for although we ^ake such acts with out gust and with
out any ^atisfaction, we must not be troubled; since our lord loves them
better so; And do not say, as ^ou are wont: alas it is no otherwise then from
^he mouth: for if the heart would it not, the mouth would not speak^ a word;
Having done this, ^emayne in peac^ with out reflecting upon your ^rouble;
speak to out Lord of some other thing Consider then for conclusion of this
first point, that ^t is very good to have confusion, when we have ^he knowlegd
and feeling of our misery, and imperfe^^ion: but we must not there in nor for
it ^a^^ into into discourageme^t but raise up our heart unto God by a holy
Confidence, the foundation where of ought to be in him; and not in us: For so
much as we change and he never changes, but remains allwais as good and as
merciful, when we are weak and imperfect, as when we are strong and perfect I
am wo^t to say, that the ^hrone of the mercy of God is our misery: it
follows the^ that how much greater our misery shall be, so much great there
Confidence must we have.

3. Let us past now to the other question, of forsaking ones self, and what
ought to be the cxercise of the soul abandoned; It must then be understood
that to aba^don our soul and to leave our selves, is no other thing, then to
quitt and break us of our self will, to give it unto God: for it should serve
us but little (as I have already said) to renounce and leave our selves, if
it wear not to unite us more perfectly to the divine goodness: it is this then
for which this giving over ones self ought to be mad^ which otherwise would be
unprofitable, a^ should rese^ble those of the antie^t philosophe^ who made
admirable renuntiations of the selves and of all things, for a vain pretext
give them selves to philosophy, as Epicte^ most renowned philosopher, who being
a sla^ by condition, by reason of his great wisdom they wear content to have
given hem his fre^dome; but he out of an extreme renuntiatio^ would not have
his liberty, and so voluntaril^ remained in slaueric with so great poverty
that after his death they found no other house hold stuff of his but a Lamp,
which wa^ sold very dear, because it had been the La^p of so great a man; But
we must not abandon ou^selues, unless it wear to leave our selves to the mercy
of the will of God. There are man^ who say to our Lord: I give my self wholly
to the with out any reservation; but there are very few, which unbrace the
practice of this renuntiation, which is no other thing, then a perfect
indifferency to receive all sorts of euent^ according as they arrive by the
order of the divine providence as well affliction, as co^solatio^; sickness as
health; poverty, as riches, eonte^pt as honor, and infamy as glory, the
which I mean according to the Superior part of our soul; for there is not
any doubt, but that the inferior and natural inclination will allwaies bend
and tend to the side of honor, rather then that of contempt: of riches, then
that of poverty although there are not any that can be ignorant; that
contempt, abiection, and poverty, are more pleasing to God, then honor, and
abundance of great riches.

. 4. Now to get this relinquishing of all at soever, we ought to obey the will
of God ^nified, and that of his good pleausure, the one done by may of
resignation, the other by way indifferency. The will of God signified
com^ehendeth his commaudements, his counsels ^s inspirations, our Rules, and
the ordinances our Superiors. The will of his good pleau^^e, regards the
events of things, which we ^n not foresee (or) prevent: as for example; I ^owe
not if I shall die to morrow, I do see at this is the good pleausure of God,
and there ^re I render my self to his holy will, and ^ll die willingly, In
like fort I know not if the ^^xt year, all the fruits of the earth shall be
^asted; if it happen they be, or there be plague ^t other like events, it is
evident that this is the ^ood pleasure of God, and therefore I conform ^y
self there unto. It may happen that you shall not have consolation in your
exercises; it (...) certain that then this is the good pleasure of ^od,
wher-fore you must remain with an ex^eame indifferency between desolation,
and ^onsolation. The same ought to be done in all things, which shall artiue
unto us, in the clothes that are given us, and in the meats that are
^resented us.

. 5. It ought moreover to be noted, that there ^re things in which the will of
God signified is ^oined to that of his good pleasure: as if I fall sick of a
grievous fever, I see that the good pleasure ^f God in this event is, that I
remain indifferent either for health or sickness; but the will of God signified
is, that I who am not under obedience, call for the physician, and that I apply
all the remedies I can; I do not say the most exquisit but the common and
ordinary; and that t^^ Religious, who are under a Superior, recea^^ the
remedies, and usage which are presente^ them in simplicity and submission: for
God ha^ signified it unto us, in this that he has give virtue unto remedies;
the holy Scripture teaches it in many places, and the church orday^eth it: now
this being done, let the sickne^ surmount the remedy, or the remedy surmou^
the malady, we ought to be perfectly indiffere^^ in such sort, thar if
sickness and health wear present before us, and that our Lord did say vnt^ us:
if thou chose health, I will not take from thee one grain of my grace: and if
thou mak^ choice of sickness, I will not augment it one io^ at all: but to make
choice of sickness would b^ more agreeable to my will, the soul then, tha^
entirely abandoneth, and comitteth it self into the hands of our Lord, will
with out doubt choos^ sickness, for this cause only, that there is in i^ some
what more of the good pleasure of God yea though she wear to remain all her
life in ^ bed, not being able to do any other thing, the to suffer, yet would
not she for any thing in the world desire any other estate then that. Even the
saints which are in heaven, have such an vnio^ with the will of God, that if
there wear to be had a little more of the good pleasure of God in hell thy
would quitt paradise to go thither. This estate of forsaking of ones self
comprehends also the entire resignation to the good pleasure of God in all
temptations, as drinesses, auersions, and repugnances, which may arrive in a
spiritual life; for in all these things we see the ^od pleasure of God; when
they arrive not by ^r default, and that on our part there be no ^ne. In fine
this renuntiation of our selves, is ^e virtue of virtues: it is, the cream of
^haritie, the sweet savor of humility, the ^eritt (as it seems) of
patience, and the fruit (...) perseverance. O great is this virtue, and ^lie
worthy to be practiced by the most dear ^hildren of God. My father; said our
most ^weet Savior upon the cross I committ my ^iritt into thy bands as if
he would Say: ^s true that all is consummate, and that have accomplished all
that thou have com^aunded me: but more over if such be thy ^ill, that I remain
yet on this Cross, to ^^ffer more, I am content, and committ my ^^irit into thy
hands, thou may do there^ith, even as it shall please thee We ought ^ do
the same, my most dear daughters, ^ every occasion, be ir that we do suffer,
^r that we do enjoy some contentment; ^eauing our selves to be conducted by
^e divine will, according to his good ^easure, with out ever permitting our
^elues to be preoccupated by our particular will. Out Lord loves with an
extreme ^ender love those, who are so happy, as ^o abandon themselves totally
to his pa^ernall care, leaving themselves to be go^erned by his divine
providence, with out ^^nusing (or) considering whether the effects ^f this
prouidedce, shabe beneficial, pro^itable, or dommagable to them, being most
assured, that nothing shall be sent unto them from his paternall and amiab^
heart; nor that he will permit any thing to arri^ unto them, aut of which he
will not can^ them to draw good and profit; provided the they put their whole
confidence in him, a^ that thy say with a good heart: I remitt my spir^^ my
soul, my hodie, and all that I have into t^ blessed hands, to do according as
it sh^^ please thee. For we are never reduced to suc^^ extremity, that we may
not allwaies pow^^ before his divine majesty perfumes of holy su^mission to
his most blessed will, and a continua^^ promise never willingly to offend him.

. 2. Sometimes our Lord will that the soul chosen for the service of his divine
maies^^ should nourish them selves wih a firm and i^uariable resolution to
follow him, among the disgusts, drinesses repugna^ces, and asperities (...) a
spiritual life, with out consolation, sweetnes^ tenderness and gusts; and that
they believe themselves, not to be worthy of other treating: fo^lowing our
divine Savior with the pure poi^ (or) quintessence of the spirit, having no
other prop or stay, then that of the divine will, which would have it so.
Behold then how I desi^^ you should walk my Dear daughters.

But now you demand of me, wherein this soul ought interioulie 'to employ her
self, which i^ totally aba^doned into the hands of God? she sha^^ do nothing
but remain near unto our Lord with out care of any thing, no not of her own
body nor of her soul; for since she is imbarke^ under the providence of God,
what has she t^ do to think of that which is to come? ou^ Lord, to whom she
has totallie left her self will provide sufficie^tlie for her. Yet my meaning
^s not, that she think not of those things, to which she is obliged, according
to her charge; for a Superior ought not under color of ^bandoning her self
to God, and reposing in ^is care, neglect to read, and learn the documents,
which are proper for the exercise of her ^harge. It is most true that she ought
to have great confidence, to forsake her self in such manner, with out any
reservation to, the divine ^rouidence; Moreover that when we abandon ^ur
selves wholly, our Lord takes care of all, and conducteth all: but if we
reserve any thing of the which we confide not in him, he leaves us; as if he
said, You think to be wise enough with out me, I leave you to govern, you
shall see how you will find your selves there-in Those who are dedicated to God
in Religion, ought to abandon all with out any reservation. Saint Marye
Magdalene, who was totallie given over to the will of our Lord, remained at his
feet, and did hearken whilst he spoke; and when he ceased to speak, she also
ceased to ^earken; but she did not therefore remove from being near him: even
so the soul, which is so given over, has noe other thing to do, then to
remain beweene the arms of our Lord, as a child in the bosom of his Mother,
who when ^he sets him on the ground for to go, he goes, until such time
as she takes him up again; and when she will carry him he permits it; for
he knows not, nor thinks whether he goes; but leaves himself to be
carried, or lead, whether it pleases his Mother; in the same sort, this soul
loving the will of the good pleasure of God, in all things that arrive unto
her, leaves her self to be carried, and walks nevertheless, perf^rming
with great diligence the will of God, as far fo^th as it is signified unto
her.

. 3. You ask now, if it be possible, that our will may be so dead in our Lord
that we may come in a sort to know no more what we will, or what we will not? I
say in the first place, that it never happens so to abandon our freedom and
the liberty of our free will, that it remaynes not with us; so that allwaies
we have some desire and some will; but these are not absolute wills, and formed
desires; for so soon as a soul, which has plunged it self into the good
pleasure of God, perceaueth in it self any will, she incontinently makes it
to dye in the goo^ will of God.

. 4. You would also know, if a soul which is yet imperfect, may be able to
remain profitably before God, with this simple attention to his holy presence
in prayer; I tell you, i^ that God place you there, you may well remain there;
for it happens very often, that our Lord gives these quietnesses, and
tranquillities to some souls, that are not well purged; but whiles it is
expedient that they purify them selves more perfectly, they ought out of
prayer to consider what is necessary for their amendment; For although God
would allwaies hold them thoroughly recollect, yet have they sufficient
liberty besides to discourse with the understanding upon diverse indifferent
things: where-fore then may they not consider and make resolutions for their
amendment and the practice of virtues? There ^re very perfect persons, to whom
our lord ^euer gives such sweetness, nor this quiet^es; who do all with the
Superior part ^f their soul, and make their will to die with ^n the will of
God by a sweet and lively ^orce, and with edge of reason: this death speak
of, is the death of the spouse the which is much more excellent and generous
^^en the other, and ought rather to be called (...) sleeping, then a death; for
this soul which ^s embarked in the ship of the providence of ^od, permits
her self to sail sweetly; ^s a person who sleeepth with in a shipp upon a
calm sea, yet does not cease therefore ^o go forward; this manner of death
so sweet, ^s given by way of grace; the other is given by ^ay of merit.

. 5. You would further know, what foun^ation our confidence ought to have? It
must ^e founded upon the infinite Goodness of God, and upon the meritts of the
death and passions of our lord JESUS CHRIST, with this condition on our part;
that we have and know in our selves an entire and firm re^olution to be wholic
Gods, and to abandon our ^elues totallye with out any reservation, to his
^rouidence; I desire allwaies that you mark that I say not, that we must feel
this reso^ution of being totallie Gods, but only that ^t must be had and known
in us: for so much as we must not study (or) muse on that we feel or on that
we feel not, because the most part of our feelings and sattisfactions ^re no
other then delays of going forward, instigated by self love. Also it must not
be understood, that in all these things here spoken of renuntiation, and of
indifferency, w^ never have desires contrary to the will of God and that
nature do not repugne at the event of his good pleasure: for this may often
happen these virtues are those which make their residence in the Superior part
of the soul; the inferior ordinarily knows nothing of it; an^ no account
must be made of what that inferiou^ part feels: but not regarding what it
wills* or wills not, we ought to embrace this divine will; and unite our
selves there unto whether it will or no; There are few persons tha^ arrive to
this degree of perfect forsaking themselves; but we all of us nevertheless
ough^ to pretend it; each one according to her abilliti^ and capacity.

LJVE JESUS LJVE.
THE THIRD ENTERTAINMENT.
Upon the flight of our Lord, into Egypt: Wherein is treated of the Constancy
which w^ ought to have, in the midst of the accidents of this World.
1. WE Celebrate the octaue of the feast of the Holy Innocents, o^ which day
the holy Church causes to be read the Gospel that treats, how the Angel
of our Lord, spoke ^o the glorius S. Joseph in a dream, that is to ^y, in
sleep, that he should take the Child and ^is mother, and fly into Egypt, for
so much as Herod being jealous of his Royalty, did search after our Lord to
put him to death, for fear cast he should deprive him of it; and being ^lled
with choler, because the wise men did not ^etourne to him into Jerusalem as he
expected, ^e commanded that they should kill all the ^hildren from woe years
old and under, ^eleeuing our Lord should be found among ^^em, and thar by this
means he should be ^ssured of the possession of his kingdom: ^his Gospel is
full of diverse excellent consi^eratio^s. I will content my self with such ^s
shall serve us for an entertaynment, as well ^easing as profitable.

. 2. I begin with the first remarkable note which the great S Ihon Chrysostom
makes; which is, of the inconstancy variety, and insta^ilitye, of the
accidents of this mortal life. O ^ow profitable is this consideration; for the
^ant there of, is that, which carries us into ^iscouragment, and
fantasticallnesse of spirit, ^nquietnesse, variety of humors, inconstancy,
and instabilitye in our resolutions; for we would ^ot encounter in our way with
any difficulty, ^r contradiction, nor any pain: we would ^^waies have
consolations, and be free from ^^idities and dryness of spirit; we would
all^aies have good things with out mixture of any evil; health with out
sickness; repose with ^ut labor, and peace with out trouble; Alas who ^eth not
our folly? for we will that which cannot be: Unmingled purity is to be found^
no other place, then in heaven, and in hell: i^ heaven, goodness, pleasure,
rest, and consolation are in there purity, with out mixture o^ any evil,
trouble, o^ affliction; on the contrari^^ there is found in hell, evil,
despair, troub^^ and unquietness, in their purity with o^ mixture of any
good, hope, tranquillity, o^ peace But in this decaying life of ours good
(...) never found with out evil; riches with o^ unquietness, rest with out
labor, consolation with out affliction, health with out sickness: (...) breife
all is mixed and mingled, the good wi^^ the badd; there being a continual
variety ^ diverse accidents. Even so would God diuersi^^ the times of the year;
that Summer should b^ followed by the autumn: and winter by the spring; to
show unto us that temporal thing are perpetually mutable, inconstant and
su^iect to change, and that nothing is permane^ in this life. And the defect of
the knowled^ of this truth is, as I have said, that which makes us mutable,
and changing in our h^mours: for so much as we do not serve o^ selves, with
the reason that God has given v^ the which reason causes us to become
imm^table, firm and solid, and therefore like to Go^ When God said; Let us
make man to our likn^ he immediately gave unto him reason, and the use there of;
to discourse, consider and discer^ good from evil, and those things which
deser^ to be elected or rejected. It is reason that make^ us Superiors and
lords over all creatures. W^^ God had created our first parents, he gave the
entire dominion, over the fishes of the sea a^ beasts of the earth, and
consequently gave them the knowledge of their diverse kinds, and ^eanes to rule
them, and become their master and lord: God has not only done this grace ^o
man to make him lord of creatures, by means ^f the gift of reason given unto
him, by the which he becomes like unto himself; but ^urthermore he has
given him full power over ^ll sorts of accidents and events. It is said that
^ wise man, that is to say, a man that is guided ^y reason, shall cause
himself to be absolute ^aister of the planetts: what is the meaning of his,
but that by the use of reason he shall re^ayne firm and constant, in the
diversity of ^ccidents and eue^ts of this mortal life? whether ^he time be
fair, or that it rain; whether the ^yre be calm, or the wind blow; the wise
man ^aketh no thought therefore, knowing very well that nothing is stable* and
permanent in this life, ^his not being the place of rest. In affliction ^e
dispayreth not, but expects consolation: ^n sicknnes he does not vex
himself, but ex^ecteth health; or if he perceive the evil to be ^uch, that
death is to follow, he blesses God ^xpecting the repose of an immortal life
to ^ollow this; if he encounter poverty, he is not ^fflicted: for he knows
well, that riches are ^ot in this life with out poverty; if he be despi^ed, he
knows well that honor here, has ^ot any perpetuity, but is ordinarily
pourse^ed with dishonor, or contempt. In breife in ^ll sorts of events, be it
prosperity or adversity ^e remains firm, stable and constant in his
^esolution of pretending, and tending to the ^^nioyng of eternal goods.

. 3. But we must not only consider thi^ variety change and mutation in
material an^ transitory things of this mortal life: no; bu^ we ought to
consider them also in the success o^ our spiritual life where stabilitie and
consta^ci^ are so much the more necessary, by how much the spiritual life is
raised far above the corporal and mortal life. It is a very great abuse not
to have a will to suffer, or feel mutation and changes in our humors, whiles
we do not govern our selves by reason, neither wi^^ be governed by others: we
say eommolie^ behold this Child, he is very young, but ye^ for all that he
has allreadie the use of reason^ even so many have the use of reason, who ye^
for all that, even as Children, do not gouern^ themselves by the commandment
of reason^ God has given man reason for his guide: bu^ not with standing there
are very few which permit it to rule in them; contrariwise the^ give over
themselves to be governed by their passions, which should be subject and
obedien^ to reason, according to the order which go^ requires of us I will
make it more easy to b^ understood; for the most part persons of the wotld
yeald them selves to be governed an^ guided according to their passions, and
no^ according to reason; they are also ordinarily^ iarring, varying, and
changing in their humors* if they have a desire to go to bed early or late*
they do it; and if they have a mind to walk in the feeldes, they rise betimes
in the morning and if to sleep, they effect it; when they will they break
their fast, sooner or latter, as the^ please; and they are not only iarring
and unconstant in this, but they are the same likewise ^n their conuer^ation;
they will that every one should accommodate them selves to their hu^ours, but
they will not be accommodated to those of others: they give themselves over to
^e carried by their inclinations, particular affe^tions and passions, and this
is not esteemed ^itious among worldly people, and provided ^hey do not much
disturb the minds of their ^eigbour, they are not esteemed fleeting and
^nconstant: and wherefore is this? For no other thing, but for so much as this
is an ordinary evil among seculars. But in Religion, they cannot permit
themselves, in such sort to be ^ransported by their passions, considering that
^or exterior things, out Rules are to keep us ^n order to pray to eat, and
to sleep (and ^he like of other exercises) allwaies at the same ^oure when
obedience, or the bell signifies it unto us; furthermore we allwaies have one
manner of conversation, we cannot separate our selves; in what then may
vnsetlednes, and ^nconstancie be exercised? it is in the diversity of humors
of wills, and of desires: now I am ^oyfull, because all things succeed
according to my will; with in a while I am sorrowful, because there shall be
some little contradiction, which I did not expect. But do you not know, that
this is not the place, where pure pleasure is to be found, with out mixture of
displeasure? and that this life is interlaced with the like accidents? this day
you are encouraged, because you find cons^lation in prayer, and you resolve to
serve God very well: but to morrow you shall be in dryness, and you will have
no heart for the service of God, Good God, say you, how I a^ decayed in vigor,
and violently borne down* Tell me now, I pray you; if you governed you^ self
by reason, should you not see, that if it were good to serve God yesterday,
that it is ye^ more good to serve him this day, and that it shall be much
better to serve him to morrow? for h^ is allwaies the same God, as worthy to be
loue^ when you are in dryness, as when you are in co^solatio^. Now will I one
thing, to morrow I would have another that I see such a one to do at the
present, pleases me, and with in a while displeases me, in such sort that it
will be capable to mak^ me conceive an auersion from her; at the prese^^ I love a
person very much, and her conversation is gratfull and pleasing to me, and to
morrow ^ shall be scarce able to support it; and what means this? is she not as
capable to be loved thi^ day, as she was yesterday? if we did regar^ what
reason does dictate to us,, we should see^ that this person ought to be loved,
because it i^ a creature, which bears the Image of the divine majesty; so we
should have as much content in her co^uersatio^ now as heretofore we had;
therefore this proceeds of noe other cause, the^ tha^ we give out selves over
to be guided according to our inclinations, passions, and affections; so
perverting the order that God has placed in us, that all should be subject to
reason: for if reason^ reign not over all our powers, over our faculties our
passions, inclinations and affections, and in fine over all our proceedings:
what will happen of it? but a continual vicissitude, inconstancye, variety,
changing, and iarring, which wlle make us at the present to be fervent and
little after remiss, negligent, and sloth full; ^^e while joyful, and by and
by melancholy? we ^^albe peaceful and tranquil one hour, and ^^ter unquiet
two days together. In breife our ^^fe shall pass away in sloth and loss of
time. ^hen by this first note we are incited, and ^mmoned, to consider the
inconstancy, and ^arietie of successes, as well in te^porall things as ^
spitituall, to the end that by the events that ^ccurre, which may be able to
affright our spi^^tts (as being new things, and not prevented) we ^^ose not
our courage, nor permit our selves to ^e carried into inequality of humors
in the midst ^f the inequalitye of accidents that arrive unto ^s; but rather
submitt our selves to be guided by ^^e reason that God has placed in us, and
resigre ^ur selves to his providence, and so remain ^rme constant and
inuariable, in the resolution ^e have mode to serve God, constantly,
cou^^geouslie, and orderly, with out any discon^^nuation whatsoever.

5. If I did speak before persons that did ^or understand me, I would endeavor
to incul^a^e it unto them, in the best manner that were ^ossible for me; but
you know that I have allwaies endeavored thoroughly to ingraue in your memory,
this most holy equallitie of spirit, ^s being the most necessary and
peculier virtue ^f Religion. All the ancient Fathers of Religious orders have
had particular care and pro^idence for it, that this equally and stabilitie of
^umours, and of spititt should reign in their Monasteries* for this they have
established sta^utes, constitutions and Rules, to the end the Religious might
serve themselves of the^ as of a bridge to pass from the equallitie of
exercis^ which are there appointed, and to which the are to be subject; to this
so amiable, and desir^ble equallitie of spirit, in the midst of the
in^qualitie of accidents they meet with all, aswe^ in the way of our mortal
life, as in the way (...) our spiritual life. The great S. Chrysostom^ says.
O man, wherefore do thou disqui^ thy self, because every thing succedeth
not ^ thou would have it? art thou not ashamed (...) see, that this that
thou will have; was not to (...) found, even in the family of our Lord?
Co^sid^^ I pray thee, the change, the alteration, the diue^sitie of subjects,
that are there to be seen: O^ blessed lady having received the message, the
the should conceive by the holy Ghost a sonn^ who should be Lord and Savior
of the worl^ what joy, what iubilation did she feel in th^^ sacred hour of
the incarnation of the eternal word? a while after Saint Joseph perceauin^
her to be with child, and knowing well, th^^ it was not by him; good God, in
what affliction and distress was he? what did he not endure? an^ Bl. Lady,
what extreamitie of grief and afflicti^ did she not feel in her soul, seeing
her dear^ spouse at the point to leave her: her modesty^ not permitting her to
discover to Saint Iosep^ the honor and grace where with God ha^ magnified
her? A little after this tempest wa^ passed, the Angel having discovered to S.
Iosep^ the secreat of that mystery, what content an^ joy was wanting unto
them? truly none? when our Bl Lady brought forth her son the Angel^
declared his byr^h to the shepheardes and the^ wise men came to adore him: I
leave to you^ consideration, what Iubilation, and consolation ^hey had in this
occasion; But attend, for this is ^ot all: immediately after the Angel of our
Lord ^ame to S. Joseph in his sleep saying: Take the ^hild and his mother, and
fly into Egypt, for Herod will seek means that the child be slain. O, with
out doubt this was a subject of most great grief unto our Bl. Lady, and S.
Joseph. O how the Angel treats S. Joseph like a true Religious person: Take
the child, says he, and his mother, and fly into Egypt, and, remain there
until such time as I shall tell thee; what is this? might not the poor S.
Joseph have said: you bid me to go, will there not be time enough to depart
earelie in the morning! or will you have me to go in the night? my furniture
is not ready; how will you have me carrye the child? shall I have arms strong
enough to carrye him continually in so long a journey? or would you have his
mother to carry him in her turn? alas! do you not see that she is young, and
very tender? I neither have horse nor monye, for the voyage: and do you not
know that the Egyptians are enemies to the Israelites? who shall receive us?
and the like difficulties, which surely we had alleged to the Angel, if we
had been in the place of S. Joseph; who said not so much as one word to
excuse himself from performing the obedience; but departed at the same hour,
and accomplished all that the Angel had commanded him. There are many
profitable documents in this commandment: first we are taught, that we must
in no sort delay and be remiss in that which concerns obedience; it is the
fashion of the slothful to linger and say, (as S. Augustin^ said of him
self) By and by, yet a little, an^ then I will convert my self. The Holy
Ghos^ will brook no delay, but desires a great pro^ptitude in following of
his i^spiratio^s. Our loss^ comes of our negligence, which mak^th us to say ^
will begin by and by; and why not in this hour^ which he inspireth and exciteth
us forward^ truly because we are so tender over our selves that we fear every
thing that may seem to tak^ away our rest and repose: which is no other thin^
then our backwardnes, and lasines, from which we will not be with drawn by the
solicitatio^ o^ any objects, which inuit us to go out of ou^ selves: and we
say in a manner as the slothful man, who co^playning of those, that would have
him come forth of his house: how shall I com^ forth saved he, for there is a
lio^ in the high way, and a Bear in the passages; and with out doub^ they will
devour me? O how much are we to blame, to permit God our Lord, to send and
resende, to knock and strike at the gate of our hearts so many times, before
that we will open it unto him, and permit him to dwell therein; for it is to
be feared that we do provoke and constrain him to abandon and forsake us
Moreover the great peace and equality of spirit of the most Holy virgin, and
S. Joseph ought to (...) considered: and their co^stancye in the thickest of so
great inequality of diverse accide^ts, which happened unto them as we have said.
N^w consider if we have reason to trouble our ^elues and be astonished if we
find the like encou^ters in the house of God which is Religion; since that this
was in the same famylie of our Lord, where stabilitie and soliditie it self
made his residence, which was ^^r lord Jesus? This ought to be spoken and
re^eated of us many times, to the end to engraue ^ the better in our souls;
to wit, that the ine^uallity of accidents ought never to carrye our ^ules and
spirits into the inequallity of hu^ours; for the inequallitie of humors
procee^eth from no other source or spring, then of our ^assions, inclinations,
or immortified affections; and they ought not to have power over us, whiles ^ey
incite us to do, to leave undone, or desire any thing, how little soever it
may be, which is ^o^trarie to that, which reason does dictate unto ^s to be
done, or left undone for to please God.

I will pass to the second consideration, that I ^ote upon this word of the
Angel of our lord, ^ho said to S. Joseph, Take the child, and that which
follows; but I will in sist upon this ^orde, The Angel of our lord: upon
which I de^^re we would mark well, what estimation we ^ught to make of the
care, help assistance and dire^tio^ of those, who^ God has placed round aboud
^s, to assist us the more securely to go forward ^n the way of perfection.
First it must be vnder^^ood that when it is said: The Angel of our lord: ^t
may not be thought to be spoken as if it wear ^ayed of one of us: the Angel
of such a one; or ^he Angel of such a one: for this wear as much ^s so say
our Angel gardia^ who has care of us by Gods appointment: but our lord, who
is the king and guide of Angels the^selu^s, had no need du^ing the course of
his mortal life of an Angel ^ardien. Therefore when it is said, The Angel of
^ur lord, it ought thus to be understood, to wit ^he Angel appointed to guide
and conduct the family of our Lord, and more spetiallie ded^cated for his
service, and that of his holy M^ther the B. Virgin. Now to explicate this mo^
familiarlie, we changed Officers and ayd^ some days past; what signifies
these ay^ that are given you? wherefore do we give y^ them? S. Gregory
says; that in this miserab^ world we ought to do, as those, who walk upon
the ice if we will keep our selves stedye a^ solid in the enterprise of
saving our souls, ^ perfitting our selves: for says he, they ta^^ one the
other by the hand, or under the arm, ^ the end that if any one among them
slipp, ^ may be held up by the other, and that the oth^^ may be stayed by him,
when he shall be in dang^^ to fall in his turn. We are in this life as upon the
ice, finding in every design occasions a^ to make us stu^ble and fall;
so^tines into anxiet^ now into murmors a little after into ficklen^ and
inconstancy of spirit; which will cause, the nothing that is done, shall be to
give us conten^ment, and we will begin to be disgusted wit^ our vocation:
melancholy suggesting unto v^ that we shall never do any thing of worth; an^
the like things and accidents, that encounter ^ in our little spiritual world:
for man is an abrig^me^t of the world; or, to say better, a little wor^^ in the
which he meets with all that is seen i^ the grear universal world: our
passions repres^ the beasts and living creatures, which are wit^ out reason;
our senses, inclinations, affection^ powers, and the faculties of our soul,
all the^ have their particular signification: but I will n^ stay on this, but
will follow on my discour^ begun: These aids then, who are given us, a^ (...)
assist us, and to keep us firmly in our way, ^ the end to hinder us from
falling; or if we fall, ^ help us to rise again. O God! with what ^eedome,
hartinesse, sincerity, simplicity, and ^^thfull confidence ought we to treat
with these ^sistants, which are given us of God for our ^irituall advancement?
certanlie no otherwise, ^en as with our good Angels: and we ought ^ respect
them with the like reverence; for our ^ood Angels are called our Angels
gardians, because they have charge to assist us with their ^spirations; to
defend us in our dangers; to ^prehend us for our faults; to incite us to the
^orsute of virtue: it is their charge, to carrye ^ur prayers before the throne
of the bounty and mercy of our Lord, and to bring unto us ^e full grant of
our requests; and the favors which God will do us, he does them by the
^ediation, or intcrcession of our good Angels. ^ur assistants are our visible
good Angels, eue^ ^s our holy Angels gardians are our invisible: ^^ey aid us
visibly, in that which our good ^ngells do interiorlye; for they advertise us
of ^efects, they encourage us in our weakness and ^^ynthartednesse they excite
us to the porsute of ^ur intended course for to attain unto perfection ^hey
hinder us by their good council from falling and help us to rise again, when
we are thrown ^owne into some steep and deep downfall of ^mperfections or
fault; if we be overwhelmed with irksomnes and disgusts, they assist us to
^eare our pains patiently, and they pray to God to give us stre^gh to support
it as we ought ^o do, and not to be subdued in temptation. Now ^ou see the
account we ought to make of their ^ssistance, and of the care they have for us.

I consider next, wherefore our Lord IES^^ CHRIST who is the eternal wisdom,
did (...) take care of his family, I would say did n^^ advertise S. Joseph, or
his most shweete Mot^e^ of all that was to arrive vnt^ them; might n^ he very
well have said to his foster father ^ Joseph: Let us go into Egypt, we shall be
the^ some time since it is a most assured case, that (...) had the use of
reason, from the instant of h^^ conception with in the intrails of the most
H^lie virgin Mother: but he would not do a m^racle, to speak before the time
was come^ might not he v^ry well have inspired it into t^^ heart of his most
holy Mother, or of his well-beloved supp^sed Father S Joseph, the spouse (...)
the most sac^ed ^irgin? wherefore then did h^ not this, but rather left it to
the commission o^ the Angel, which was much inferior to ou^ Blessed Lady?
this was not with out mysteri^^ Our Lord would not take upon him the offic^ of
the Angel Gabriell, who having been deputed to announce the mystery of the
incarnation to the glorious virgin from the eternal father; was thenceforth as
it were high stewar^ and gouerner of ^he house and family of our Lord to have
care there of in the diverse accide^ts, an^ occurences, which they should
encounter wit^ all; and to hinder that nothing might happen^ which should be
able to shorten the life o^ our little infant newborn: this was the cause^
wherefore he aduertisled S Joseph, to carry him speedily into Egypt, to avoid
the tira^nye of Herod who had determined to murder him: Ou^ Lord would not be
gouerner of himself, bu^ permitted himself to be carried where the^ would,
and by whom they would: it seems the^ (...) did not esteem himself wise
enough to ^ide himself nor his famylie; but leaued the ^ngell to govern, even
so as pleased him; al^ough he neither had the knowledge nor the ^isdome, to
enter comparison with his divine ^aiestie. And now shall we be so daring for to
^y, that we will govern our selves, as having ^o more necessity of direction,
nor of the assistance ^f those, that God has given us for guides; not
^steeming them of capacitye sufficient for us? tell ^e, was the Angel greatter
then our Lord, or ^ur Lady? had ^e a better spirit and more ^^dgme^t? in no
case; was he endued with any spe^all or particular grace, or more quallif^ed?
this ^a^not be, seeng, that our Lord is God, and man ^oth together: and tha^
our Bl: Lady being his Mother, by co^se ^ue^c^ has more grace and per^ectio^
the^ all the Angels t^gether have; not with ^^a^ding all this, the Angel
commanded, and he is ^beyed. Moreover behold the order, that is ^ept in this
holy familye, there is no doubt it was the same of the sparrowhauke where the
^emalts are mistristes and are more worth then ^he males: who can doubt that
our Bl. Lady was much more worthy then S. Joseph, and that she ^ad more
discretion and quallities proper for go^erme^t then her spouse? Nevertheless
the Angel ^ddressed not himself to her, for every thing that was requisite
to be done, whether it wear ^o go or to come, nor in fine for whatseouer it
wear that the angel commanded. Does it not ^eeme to you great indiscretio^ to
address himself rather to S. Joseph then to our Bl. Lady, who is the chief
of the house, carrying with her ^he treasure of the eternal father? had not
she ^easo^ to be offended with this manner of proceeding and usage? with out
doubt she might ha^ said to her spouse: Werefore shall I go in^ Egypt, since
my son has not revealed to me the I should do it: neither has the Angel
spoken unto me of it? Bur our Bl. Lady said nothin^ of all this, she was not
offended, because the A^gell addressed himself to St. Joseph; but rath^^ she
simply obeyed in all: because she knew^ that God had so ordained it; she
informed ne^ her self wherefore, but it was sufficient for h^ that God would
have it so, and with out cons^deration she took, delight to submitt her self*
But I am greatter then the Angel or S. Joseph might she have said; but she
spoke not on^ such word. Do you not see that Allmighti^ God takes pleasure to
treat with men in thi^ manner, to teach them most holy and amourou^ submission?
Saint Peter was an old man, ignorant and rusticall: and S Ihon on the
contrary, was young, sweet and pleasing; nevertheless it was the will of God
that S. Pete^ should govern others, and be the vniuersa^ Superior, and S.
Ihon be one of them tha^ wear guided by him, and obedient unto him It is a
strange case of man's spirit that will no^ be brought to adore the secrett
mysteries o^ God, and his most holy will, if it have not some kind of knowledge
wherefore this or wherefore that. I have a better spirit, (say they, in praise
of themselves,) more experience, and the^ like goodly reasons, that are proper
for nothing else then to produce unquietness, inconstant humors; and
murmours? what reason had they to give this Office? wherefore have they said
this? to what end do they such a thing to this party, rather then to
another^ ^hese spirits truly are greatly to be pitied. ^soone as we give our
selves over to search ^rrowlye into every thing that we see done; ^as what do
we not, for to loose the tran^illitie of our hearts? we ought not to seek ^y
other reason, but that God will have it so, ^d that must suffice; but who
shall, or will as^re me, that this is the will of God, say they! ^ould we that
God should reveal all things ^ secreat inspirarions? would we expect, until
^e should send his Angels to declare unto us that is his will? he did not so
to our Lady her ^^fe (at the least in this subject) but he would ^ue her know
his will by S. Joseph, to whom ^e was subject as to her Superior; we would
^eraduenture be taught and instructed by God ^ymselfe, by way of ecstasies, or
rauishments, ^d visions, and I know not what like chil^sh fopperies, that we
frame in our spiritts, ^ther then submitt our selves, to the assured and most
amiable way of true and holy submis^on, to the government of those, whom God
^ath placed to direct us, and the obserua^ce and ^irection as well of our Rules
as of our supe^ours. Let it suffice then for us to know, that it ^ the will of
God, that we obey: and and Let ^s not muse nor enter into consideration of the
^apacitie of those we ought to obey: and then ^e shall submitt our spiritts to
walk simply ^n in the way of most holy humility, which will make us
infinitlye pleasing to God.

. 7. I must now pass to the third considera^on, which is a note that I have
taken, upon ^he commandment the Angel gave to S. Joseph: ^o take the Child,
and his mother, and to go unto Egypt, to remain there until such time as he
did advertise him for to return Truly the Angel did speak very brefly, and
did treat S. Joseph like a good Religious man; sayng, Go, and return not,
until I tell thee; by this manner o^ proceeding between the Angel and S.
Joseph, we are taught in the third place, how we ought t^ embarke our selves
upon the sea of divine providence, with out biskitt, with out Rowers, wit^ out
oars, with out sails, and in fine wi^h out any kind of provision: and even so
to leave all the ca^^ of our selves, and success of our affairs to ou^ lord
with out recours or replies, or any feare^ whatsoever of that which may arrive
unto us: For the Angel said simply; take the child and hi^ mother and fly
into Egypt; not telling him, neither by whay way they should go, nor what
provision they should have to pass the journey, no^ into what part of Egypt
the should go; much less who should receive the^, or of whom the^ should be
maintained being there. Had not the^ poor S. Joseph some reason to make reply
saying, w^y bidd you me to leave this country, and tha^ so speedily, eue^ in
an instant? But this was to she^ unto us the promptitude that the Holy spirit^
requires of us, when he says unto us, raise thy^ self above thy self, go
out of such an imperfection Oh the holy spirit is a great enemy o^ remissnes,
negligence and delays ^ Consider, ^ beesech you, the great Patro^ and model
of perfect Religious, holy Abraham, behold how Go^ dealt with him; Abraham
says he go forth of thy country and from thy kindred, and go to the
mountain that I shall show thee; what say est thou, lord? that I go forth of
the town? but tell me^ the^, if I shall go toward the East or the west^ he
made no such reply, but departed thence pro^pi^, and went whether the spirit of
God condu^ed him even unto the mountain, which has ^er since been called the
vision of God; for so^uch as he received great and notable graces in ^is
mountain: to demonstrate unto us how ^atfull and pleasing promptitude in
obedience is to him Might not S. Joseph have said unto ^e Angel, y^u command
me to conduct the ^ild and his mother tell me then if you please, ^here with
shall I nourish them in the way? for ^u know well, my lord, I have no monye to
^are our charges; But he alleged no excuse, ful^ confiding, that God would
provide what ^ould be requisite for them; which he did al^ough meanly: causing
the^ to find where with ^intertayne themselves simply, either by the trade
(...) labor of S. Joseph; or otherwise by the al^es that good poeple did
bestow on the^. True^ all the ancient Religious of former times have ^ne
admirable in the confidence they have had, ^^at God would allwaies provide
sufficient of ^^at they had need of, for the sustayning of ^^eir life; leaving
all care of themselves to his ^uine providence,

. 8. But I consider that it is not only re^isite for us to repose in the
divine providence ^r that which regards temporal things, but ^uch more for
that which appertains to our ^^irituall life, and the perfection thereof. It
is no ^^her thing, truly, then the over much care we ^ue of our selves, which
makes us loose the tra^^^illitie of our spirit, and carries us into
co^tra^ery and inequallitie of humors: for that as soon (...) any
co^tradictio^s happen to us, yea when we do ^erceaue but only a little act of
our immortification or when we co^mitt some fault how lit^ soever, it seems
to us all is lost; and is the so great a marvel, to see us (poor creatur^
sometimes to fall? but I am so miserable, so full^ imperfections? know you it
well? Bless Go^ who has given you this knowledge and, do (...) lament so
much; you are very happy to know that you are no other then misery it self
Af^ you have thanked God for the knowledge whi^ he has given you, cut of this
unprofitable te^dernesse over your selves, which causes you^ complain of your
infirmities. We have diu^ delicacies concerning our bodies, which ^ exceeding
contrary to perfection: but they a more with out comparison, which we have o^
our souls. My God! says one, I am n^ faithful to our lord, and therefore I
have ^ any consolation in prayer; great pity trueli^ But I am so often in
dryness, that it makes ^ believe, that things stand not well betwee^ God and
my soul, he being so full of consolati^ is not this wisely spoken? as if God
did allwai^ give consolation to his friends: has there e^ been a pure
creature, so worthy to be belou^ of G^d, and which has been more beloved him,
then our Lady, and S. Joseph? Behoul^ they wear allwaies in consolation; Can
there imagined a more extreme affliction, then the which S. Joseph did feel,
when he perceau^ that the Glorious virgin was great with chi^ knowing well, it
was not his fact? his afflicti^ and anguish of mind being so much the great as
the passion of love is more vehement, the^^ other passions of the soul; and
furthermore, love Jealousy is the extremity of pain: t^ spouse in the
canticles declares in to be so, Love, ^ayeth she, is strong as death; for love
works the ^ame effects in the soul, that death does in the ^odye. But
Jealousy, says she, is as hard as hell: ^ leave then to your consideration,
what anxiety and grief the Bl. S. Joseph did endure: and our Bl. ^ady also,
when she perceived what opinion he, ^ho loved her so dearlye, might have of
her; and ^nowing her self to be so dearly beloved of him; ^elousye made him
to languish, and not knowing what way to take, he resolved rather then to blame
^er whom he had allwaies so much honored and ^oued, to leave her, and depart
secretly. But you will say, I am very sensible of the pain that this
^entation, or my imperfection, causes me. I ^eleeue it, but is it any way
comparable to that, ^here of we speak? it cannot be; and if it be, consi^er, I
pray you, if we have any reason to compain and lament since S. Joseph did
not complain, nor ^itnesse any disgust in his exterior: he was not any whitt
more harsh in his conversation, neith^r ^id he alter his countenance toward
our Bl. Lady, ^or treat her ill; but simply suffered this vexation, ^^d meant
no other thing, then quit her company. ^od knows what he might do in this
subject. ^y auersion, says some one, is so great from ^at person, that I do
not almost know how to ^eake unto her, but with great difficultye; her actio^
^^spleaseth me greuouslie; that is all one, you must ^ot therefore enter into
dislike against her, as if she ^^uld hinder it. But rather you ought to comport
^^ur self as our Blessed lady and S. Joseph: we ^ust be quiet in our pain,
and leave the care to ^ur lord, to take it from us when he shall please^ ^ur
Blessed Lady might very well have appeased ^is storm; not with standing she
would not do (...) out left the issue of this affayre fully to the divine
providence; these are two discording cords, but equally necessary to be
accorded, that is to say, the treble string and the base, if one mean to play
well upon the lute; there is nothing more discording then the high with the
low: notwithstanding with out the accord of these twoe strings the harmonye
of the lute cannot be delightful. Likewise in our spiritual lute, two things
are equally discordant, and necessary to be accorded; to wit, to have a
great care to perfect our selves; and not to have care of our perfection, but
to leave it entirely unto god: ^ would say, that we must have that care, that
Go^ would we should have to perfect our selves; ye^ nevertheless must leave
the care of our perfection to him. God wills that we have quiet and peaceful
care, which may cause us to do that, which i^ judged proper for us, by those
who direct us; an^ allwaies walk faithfully forward in the wa^ which is marked
by the Rules, and directions the are given us; and for the rest, that we repose
ou^ selves in his Paternall care, endeavoring as much ^ shall be possible for us,
to keep our selves in peac^ for the habitation of God is made in peace, and in
^ peaceable and well reposed heart. You know, when ^ lake or poole is very
calm, and the winds do n^^ move the waters, in a bright clear night, the
sk^ or firmament with the stars are so well represe^ted therein, that looking
downward, we see asw^^ the beauty of the heavens, as if we did look v^wards.
Likewise when our soul is well pacifie^ and the winds of superfluous ears,
inequallitie^ spirit, and inco^sta^cie, do not trouble and disqui^ it, she is
very capable to bear with in her t^ Image of our Lord JESUS; but when she is
troubl^ unquiet, and moved with diverse tempests of passi^ and permits her
self to be governed by the and not by reason (which only makes us beco^ like
to God) then is she nothing capable to represent the fair and most amiable
Image of our Lord JESUS crucified, nor the diuersitye of his excellent virtues,
neither can she be capable to serve him, for his nuptial bed. Therefore we
must leave the care of our selves to his divine mercy and providence;
nevertheless orderly and simply doing what is in our power, to amend and
perfect our selves allwaies taking especial heed, not to permit our spiritts
to be troubled and disquieted.

. I note in fine, that the Angel said to S. Joseph, that he should remain in
Egypt, until such time as he did advertise him to return; and ^he holy Saint
made him noe reply, saying, But when shall it be, O Lord, that thou will tell
me? To ^each us, that when we are commanded to em^race any exercise, we ought
not to say, shall this be for a long time? But rather we ought to embrace ^t
with simplicitye, imitating the perfect obedience of Abraham who when God
commanded him to sacrifice his son, alleged not any excuse, he complained
not, neither delayed to execute the ^ommaundement of God: therefore God did
favor him so much, as he caused him to find a ram ^here, the which he
sacrificed upon the mountain ^n place of his son, God being satisfied with
the ^romptnes of his will.

. I conclude with the simplicity that S. Io^eph did practice, in taking his
journey upon the ^ommaundement of the Angel into Egypt, where ^e was assured
to find so many enemies, as there ^eare inhabitants in that country. Might he
not ^aue said very well to the Angel, thou make me ^o carrye the child into
Egypt, and so we fly from ^ne enimye, and expose our selves into the hands of ^
thousand thousand others, which we shall find in Egypt, for so much as we are
of Israel? But he made no reflection upon the commandment and therefore went
his way full of peace and of confidence in God. In like manner, my daughters,
when any employment is imposed upon you, do not say, Good God! I am so rash
and hasty, if they impose this office upon me, I shall have a thousand cares
and fears, and be extreemly put to my plunges, I am all ready so distracted,
if they give me such a charge, I shall be much more: but if they would leave me
to my cell, I should be modest, peaceful, and recollected; Go simply into
Egypt, in the midest of the great multitude of enimyes, that you shall have
there; for God who makes you to go thither, will conserve you there, neither
shall you dye there; whereas contrariwise; if you remain i^ Israel, where is
your great enimye your prope^ will, with out doubt it will kill you there: it
should not be well done to take offices, and charges by ou^ proper election,
for fear least we perform no^ our duty there-in: but when it is by obedience
never bring any excuse; for God is for us, and u^ shall profitt more in
perfection, then if we had nothing to do. Do you not know what I have say
to you at other times? and it is not amiss to repeat it again formitt: that
virtue requires n^ that the occasions of falling into imperfections b^ taken
away it suffireth not, (says Cassian) to b^ deprived of the conversation of
men, for to b^ patient, sweet and gentle in our selves; for it ha^ happened to
me, being in my cell all alone, to b^ angry with my self, when my matter did
not ta^ fire, that I have cast it away in a chotay. I must end and in the mean
time leave you to go into Egypt with our Lord, who (as I believe and also
other do hold) began then to make little Gosses, wh^ he had vacant time,
after he had aided S. Iose^ in some little things; demonstrating even then ^
desire he had of the work of our Redemption.

THE FOVRTH ENTERTAINMENT.
Of Cordiality, where-in it is demanded, How the sisters ought to love each
other with a Cordial love, yet using no indecent familiaritye.
^. TO satisfy your demand, and to make it well understood wher-in Cordial
love ^onsisteth, wherewith the Sisters ought to love one ^n other: you must know
that Cordiallnesse is no ^ther thing, then the essence of true and sincere
^reindship: which cannot be, but between persons, that have reason, who
cherish and nourish their freind^hips by the mediation reason. For otherwise it
cannot be frindship, but only love. Even beasts ^aue love, but they cannot
have frindship, since ^hey are with out reason: they have love amongst them,
because of some natural correspondence; yea ^^kewise they bear love toward
man, as it appea^eth by experience every day, and diverse Authors ^aue written
of admirable things in this kind: as ^at they relate of a Dolphin, that did
love a young ^hild which he had seen many times upon the sea ^ore so
exceussitly that this child being dead, the ^olphin himself died with grief;
But this ought ^ot to be called freindship, for as much as necessa^ie the
correspo^dence of freindship, is to be found ^^tweene two that love each other,
and that this ^^eindshipe be contracted by the means of reason: ^as the
greatter part of freindships that men make ^t having a good end, nor being
guided by reason do not in any sort deserve the name of freindship. More-ouer,
besides the mediation of reason, there must be a certain correspondence,
either of vocation, or of pretense, or of quallitie between them that contract
freindship. Experience does clearly teach us this; for is it not true, that
there is not more true freindship, nor more strong, then that which is between
brethren? we do not call the love of fathers toward their children freindship,
nor that the children bear toward their parents; because it has not this
corresponde^ce, whereof we speak, but are different: the love of Fathers being
maiesticall love, and full of auhoritie; and that of children toward their
parents, a respective and submissiue love; but between Brothers, because of
the resemblance of their condition, the correspondence of their love, makes a
firm, strong and solid freindshipe. For this cause the ancient christians of
the primitive church, did all call themselves brethren* and this first fervor
waxing could among the common multitude of Christians, Religions wear^
instituted, where they did ordain that Religiou^ should call themselves
Brethren and Sisters to declare the true cordial and sincere freinship that
they did bear, or which they ought to bear, on^ toward an other: as there
is not any freindship comparable to that of Brethren, all other freindship
being either unequal, or artificial (as that which married persons have the
one with the other the which they have by contracts, written and pronu^ce^ by
notaries, or otherwise by simple promises. Als^ these freindships, which
worldly poeple contra^ together, are either for some particular interest, o^
for some frivolous subject, and are most ordinaril^ very subject to perish and
to be dissolved: But the which is between Brethren, is clean contrari^ for it
is natural, not artificial; and therefore ve^ recommendable: This then being
so, I say that this ^s the cause, wherefore the Religious call each other
Brethren, and therefore they have love which truly meriteth the name of
freindship, not common, but cordial freindship, that is to say, frindship
that has his foundation within the heart. We must the^ understand, that love
has his seat within the heart, and that we can never love our neighbor too
much, nor exceed the terms of reason in this love, provided that it reside in
the heart: but touching the testimony of this love, we may well fail, and
exceed therein, passing beyond the rules of reason, The Glorious S. Bernarde
says that the measure to love God, is to love him with out measure, and that
our love to him should not have any ^imitte; but it must be free to spreed his
branches so far as possible may be. That which is said of God, ought also to
be understood of the love toward our neighbor, provided allwaies that the
love of God do even swim aloft, and hold the first rank: next unto which
we ought to love our sisters with all the dilatation of our heart, not
contenting our selves to love them as our selves, (as the commandments of God
do oblige us) but we ought to love the^ more then our selves (as to our
te^porall ^ife) to observe the rules of Evangelical perfection which requires
this of us. Our Lord has said this himself: Love you one another, even as I
have loved you: that is to say, more then your selves: and even as our Lord
has allwaies preferred us before himself; and furthermore does the same
every time, that we receive him in the most Blessed Sacrament making himself
our food; likewise his will is, that we have such a love one to another, that
we ever prefer our neighbors before our selves; and even as he did all he
could for us, except ^he damning of himself (for he neither ought, nor could
do it because he could not sin, which it of it self the only thing that
leads to damnation) he wills, and the rule of perfection requires it, that
we do all that we are able one for another, except that which may cause us to
be damned; but this excepted, our freindshipe ought to be so constant, cordial
and solid, that we never refuse to do, or suffer whatsoever it be for our
neighbor and sisters.

. 2. Now this cordial love ought to be accompanied with two virtues, the one
is called affabilitye, the other, good Conversation: Affabiliaye, is a virtue
that powers forth a certain sweetness into the serious communications and
affairs we have one with another; Good conversation, is that, which renders
us gracious, and pleasing in recreations, and less serious communications,
that we have with our neighbor. All virtues, as you know have twoe conttarye
vices, which are the extremityes of virtue; the virtue of Affabilitye is in the
midst of two vices; to wit Stateliness, or over great seriositye, and too
great tenderness, to make too much of, and to speak frequent words that tend
to flaterie; now the virtue Affabilitye houldeth her self between too much,
and too little, using kindnesses according to the necessities of those with
whom we treat, nevertheless co^seruing a sweet gravity, according as the
persons and affairs, where-of we treat, do require. I say, that cherishings
(or) making much of, are to be used at proper times: for it would be very
indiscreet to use about a sick person so much gravity, as they should do with
others, not being willing to cherish her more, then if she weere in good
health. Also we should not so frequently use kindnesses; and upon every
occasion speak honye words, casting whole handfulls of them upon the first
we meet with all: for even as, if you put too much sugar upon any meat, it
will be distasteful, because ^t will be too sweet and unsavory; in like manner
too ^requent tenderness and kindnesses will become disgustfull, and not be
esteemed, knowing they are done but for fashion sake. Likewise meats upon
which are put great ha^dfulls of salt, are displeasing, because of their
sharpnes; but those whereon the ^alte, and sugar are put by measure, are made
plea^ing to the taste, in like sort courtiseys, which are used ^y measure and
discretion, are pleasing and profi^able to them, to whom they be exhibited. The
^ertu of Good Conversation requires that we co^tri^ute and condescend to holy
and moderate joy, and ^o gracious entertaynments, which may serve for
^onsolation or recreation of our neighbor: that ^n no sort we cause any
vexation to him or her, ^y our frowning and mellancholie countenances, ^r by
refusing to recreate in the time ordained for ^t. We have allreadie treated of
this virtue in the discourse of modesty; wherefore I pass further and say,
that it is a very difficult thing to hitt ^llwaies the mark we aim at: it is
true indeed; that we ought all to have this pretense, to attay^e and aim just
with in the white mark of ^ertu, the white we ought ardentlye to desire:
^ut notvvithstanding we ought not to lease cou^age when we do not rightly
encounter the ^ssence of virtue, nor be astonished thereat, proui^ed that we
keep our selves with in the round that is to say, the nearest that we may to
true ^ertu, for it is a thing which the Saints themselves have not known
how to do in all virtues, there having not been any (but our Bl. Lord and
Lady) who have been able to do it. The Saints have ^racticed them with a
very great difference: what difference I pray you is there between the spirit^
of Saint Augustine, and that of Saint Jerome? as may be noted in their
writings: there is nothing more sweet then S. Augustine, his writings are
swetnes and honey it self; contrariwise S. Icrome was extreme austere: the
better to know it, confider him in his Episteles, he is as it weere allwaie^
angry: nevertheless both of the^ were exceedingly virtuous: but the one had
more sweetness, the other much more austeritie of life, and both of them
(although not equallye either sweet or rigorous) have been great Saints. So as
we see, that we ough^ not to be astonished, if we be not equally gentle and
sweet, provided we love our neighbor according to the love of the heart wholly
extent, and a^ our Lord has loved us, (that is to say) more the^ ou^ selves,
preferring him allwaies before our selves i^ all things with in the Order of
holy Charity, an^ refusing him nothing that we may be able to contribute for
his profitt, except our damnation as (...) have already said: We must
there-fore endeavor as much as we shall be able to render exteriou^ testimony of
our affection, conformable to reason to laugh with them that laugh, and weep
wit^ those that weep.

. 3. I say we ought to manifest that we lou^ ours sisters (this is the second
part of the question^ without using indecent familiarity: the rule declares
it, but let us see what we ought to do heerin^ nothing, but that sa^ctitie
appear in our familiariti^ and manifest our freindship, as S. Paul says i^
one of his epistles: Salute, says he, one another with a holy kiss; it was
the custom, when the christians did meet together, to kiss each other Our
Lord JESUS did also use toward his Apostle this form of salutation, as we
learn in the traitou^ Judas; and holy Religious therefore did use to say
when they encountered each other, Deo gratias, to declare the great contentment
they did receive in behoulding one the other, as if they had said or would
say, I thank God, my Dear Brother, for ^he consolation he has vouchsafed me
by your presence. Even so my Dear daughters we must demonstrate how much we
love our sisters, and that we are pleased with them; provided allwaies, that
sanctity accompany the signs we give of our ^ffection; that God may not
only not be offended ^ut that he may be praised and Glorified. Likewise S.
Paul (who teaches us so to behave our selves, that our affections may be
witnessed by our san^titie) wills and teaches us to behave our selves
^raciously, giving us his example: Salute (says he) ^uch a one who knows
well that I love him with my heart, and such a one, who must be assu^ed that I
love him as my Brother, and in parti^ular his mother who knows also that she
is mine.

. 4. You demand upon this subject, if we may or should adventure to show
more affection ^o one sister whom we esteem more virtuous, the^ we do to
another. I answer to this, that although ^e are obliged to love those more
that are more ^ertuous, with the love of delight, and content: yet ^ught we not
therefore to love them more with ^^e love of good will; nor ought we to show
them ^ore signs of freindship: and this for two rea^ons. The first is, because
our Lord JESUS did not ^ractice it; but rather it seems he showed more
^ffection to the imperfect then to the perfect: since ^e has said; that he
was not come for the just, but ^or sinners, that is to say, for those that have
more ^eede of us, to whom we are to witness our love more particularlye: for
here it is, when we shevv^ best, that we love for charity, and not in
loving those that give us more consolation, then pain or trouble. And in this
we ought to proceed as the profitt of our neighbor does require; bu^ further
then this, we must endeavor so to behave our selves, that we love all
equally, since our Lord JESUS did not say: love those that are more virtuous;
but indifferently, love one with another, even as I have loved you, with out
excluding any one how imperfect soever he bee^ The second reason wherefore
we owe not sign of freindship to one, more then another; an^ ought not to
permit our selves to be carried t^ love them more, is, that we cannot judge
vvh^ are the more virtuous, and who have more perfection: for exterior
apparences are very deceat full, and very often those, that seem to you to b^
the most virtuous; (as I have saved in another part) are not so before God;
who is only he tha^ can know them. It may be that a sister vvho^ you shall
see to fail very often, and committ^^ multitude of imperfections; will be more
vertuou^ and more pleasing to Almightye God, either for the greatness of the
courage where withdraw she vphouldeth her self in the midst of her
imperf^ctions, not giving her self over to be troubled, no^ disquieted to see
her self subject to fall, or becau^^ she draws out of it Humility; or for
the love she has of her abiection: then another who shall hau^ a doren
virtues, either natural or acquired b^ has less exercise and labor; and
consequently, may be less courage, and Humility, then has the other, whom
we see subject to frailties. Saint Peter was chosen to be the head of the
Apostele^ although he vveere subject to many imperfection in such sort that he
did commit them, even aft^^ he had received the holy Ghost; but for so much
(...), not with staning these his defects, he always ^ad a great courage,
and was not astonished at ^^mselfe; our Lord made him his leiftenaunt, and
^^uored him above all the rest: so as none had ^^ason to say, he did not
deserve to have the ^riuiledg and to be advanced before Saint Ihon, ^r the
other Apostles. We must then behave our ^^lues in the affection we are to
bear our sisters ^he most equally, that possibly we may, for the foresayed
reasons; and all ought to know, that we love them with this love of the
heart; and therefore there is no necessity to use so many vvor^es, that we
love them dearly, that we have an ^nclination to love them in particular, and
the like: ^onsidering the love we bear a party, is not ^he more perfect, for
having an inclination for her more then for others: rather it may be more
subject to change; for the very least thing, that she shall do to us: If it be
so, that it be true, that ^ve have an inclination to love one rather then
another, we ought not to muse or think thereon, much less to declare it in
words to the party, for we ought not to love by inclination, but to love
our neghbour, either because he is virtuous, ^or for the hope that we have
that he will become so: but principally, because it is the will of God. Now
to give true testimony that we love him, we must procure him all the good that
we can, as well for soul as body; praying for him, and serving him cordially,
when occasion shall present it self: for the freindship that ends in fair
speeches, ^a no great matter; and it is not to love, as our Lord JESUS has
loved us, who was not content to assure us, that he did love us; but would
pass further, in doing all that he has done, for proof of his love. Saint
Paul speaking to his mo^^ Dear children: I am most ready (said he) to gi^^
my life for you, and to imploye my self so abso^^telie for you, that I will
not make any reseruatio^ for to witness how dearly and tenderly I lou^ you:
yea, would he say, I am ready to leave v^done, or to do for you, or by you,
all that yo^^ will have of me; wherein he teaches us, that ^ employ himself,
yea to give his life for his neigh^bour, is not so much as to leave himself to
be employed at the will of others, eithers by them or for them. And this was
that which he had learned ^ our sweet Savior upon the cross. This is tha^
sovereign degree of love of our neighbor, th^^ Religious men and Religious
weemen, and w^ who are consecrated to the service of God, are called unto: for
it is not enough to assist our neighbors with our temporal commodities; it is
no^ enough (says S. Bernard) to imploye our prope^ person to suffer for this
love; but it must pass further, leaving our selves to be employed for him, i^
most holy obedience, and by him, even so as h^ will, with out ever resisting
ther-in: for when w^ employ our selves for our selves, and by choice o^ our
own will, or proper election, this allwaie^ gives very much satisfaction to
self love; but t^ permit, our selves to be employed in things tha^ others
will, and which we our selves would not that is to say, in businesses, which
are not of ou^ election, this is it, wher-in the sovereign degree of
abnegation does consist. As when we would preach, they send us to serve the
sick; when we would pray for our neighbor, they send us to serve him. O how
much better and with put comparison more worth, is that which they will have us
to do (I mean in things not contrary to God, and such as are not displeasing
to him then that ^^ich we perform or make choice of our selves! ^ett us then
Love one another well, and serve our ^^lues therefore with this motive, which
is so pre^ant, for to incite us to this holy Love, which our lord JESUS upon
the cross powered forth unto the ^^st drop of his most holy blood upon the
earth. ^^r to make it as it wear a sacred mortar where^ith he would soder,
unite, conioyne, and fasten ^^gether all the stones of his church (which are
^^ythfull) the one with the other: to the end that ^is union should be so
strong that there might never be found there-in any division; so much did he
^^are, least this division should cause eternal dam^ation.

^he supporting of the imperfections of our neigh^our, is one of the most
principal points of this ^oue: Our Lord JESUS has showed it us upon the
^rosse, whose heart was so sweet toward us, and ^id love us so dearly, us I
say, and even those which ^ere did cause his death, and who wear in the act ^f
the most enormious sin, which ever man could ^ommitt: (for the sin which
the Jews did com^itt, was a monster of wickedness) and neuerthe^esse our sweet
savior JESUS had considerations of ^oue toward them, giving an example above
all ima^ination, in that he excused them who did crucify ^im, and did injury
him with most barbarous rage: ^or these I say, did he seek out inventions to
make ^is father to pardon them, in the very act it self of ^inne and iniurye.
O how miserable are we world^ings! for scarcely can we forgett an iniurye, that
^ath been done us, a long time after that we have ^eceaued it! therefore he
that will prevent his neighbor in benedictions of sweetness, shall be the most
perfect imitatour of our Lord JESUS.

. 5. Furthermore we ought to mark, that cordial love, is fastened to a virtue,
which is as a d^pendance of this love, to wit a simple confidenc^ as children
have. Children when they have a fin^ feather, or some other thing, that they
esteem bra^^ they are never in quiet, if they have not met wit^ their little
companions to show their feather, and t^ make them partakers of their joy, as
also they wi^^ have them, to have part of their grief: for when they have a
little hurt upon their fingers end, the^ cease not to speak of it to all they
meet with, t^ the end they may bemoane them, and may blow^ a little upon
their sore; now I do not say, the they must be just as children: although I
say the this confidence ought to cause Sisters not to b^ sparing to communicate
their little contents an^ consolatio^s to their sisters, also not to fear their
imperfections to be noted by the^. I do not say, if the have had any
extraordinary gift from God, th^^ they must declare it to all the world, noe:
but touching their ordinary consolations I would the they should not be too
reserved in them, but (when occasion shall present it self) not by way of
boastin^ or vanting, but with simple confidence, they man communicate them,
freely and truly one t^ an other. Likewise let us not put our selves into
unquietness to cover our defects, that they appear^ not: for not to permit
them outwardly to shew^ themselves, does not make them any whit the better: for
the sisters will not believe, that you hau^ non imperfections, because they see
none: and ou^ imperfections it may be will be more dangerous then if they wear
discovered, and that they d^ cause us confusion: even as they do to those wh^
are more facill to let them appear exteriourlie^ We must not then be amassed,
nor discourage^ when we committ defects, and imperfectio^s before our sisters,
but contrary wise we should be glad that we are known to be such as inded we
are. You ^^ue peradventure committed a fault, some inci^lity, or impertinencie*
it is true; but this is before ^ur Sisters which love you dearly, and
there^^re know very well how to support you in your ^ultes, and will have more
compassion of you, the^ ^^ssion against you; and by this means confidence
^ould exceeding he increase cordiallitie, and the ^nquillitie of our spiritts,
which are subject to be ^oubled, when we are known to fail in any thing ^w
little soever, as if it weere a great marvel to ^e us imperfect. In fine, for
conclusion of this dis^^urse, it must allwaies be remembered, that for ^me want
of gentleness, and suauitie that so^times ^omitted by mistake, we ought not to
be angrye ^r to iugd that they have not a good will toward ^r for they leave
not to have it: for that an act done ^ere or there (provided that it be not
frequent) ^aketh not men vicious, espetiallie when they have good will to amend.

THE SECOND DEMAVND. that it is, to do all things, with the Spirit of
Humility, as the Constitutions do ordain?
6. THe better to understand this, we must know, that even as there is
difference ^twen pride, the custom of pride, and the spritt (...) pride (for
if you co^mitt an act of pride, behold ^ide: if you committ acts at every
turn, and upon ^erie encounter this is the custom of pride: if you ^e
p^eased in these acts, and seek after them, it is ^e spirit of pride) so
likewise there is a difference between humilitye, the habitt of humility, a^
the spirit of humility. Humility is that, whi^^ executes some act for to
humble her self; the habi^ thereof, is to do so, at every encounter, and
vpp^ all occasions that present themselves; but the spir^ of Humility is to
delight her self in humiliatie to search after abiection, and humility in all
things that is to say, that in all we do, speak or desire, o^ principal end
be to humble and abase our selu^ and that it is pleasing to us to encounter
with o^ own abiection in all occasions, loving deare^ the very thought there
of. Behold this is that whi^ makes us to do all things in the spirit (...)
Humility, that is as much as who would say, search and love Humility and
abiection in (...) things. It is a good practice of Humility, not look after
the actions of another, otherwise the to mark their virtues, but never their
imperfecti^^ for, whiles we have no charge, we must never tu^ our eyes on that
side, much less our considerati^^ we must allwaies interpret in the best
manner the can be, what we see done to or by our neighbou^ and in doubtful
things we must persuade o^ selves, tha, t that which we perceive, is not evil,
b^ rather that it is our imperfection which cause such a thought in us; to the
end we may auoy^ rash judgments of the actions of others, which a most
dangerous evil, an which we ought sing^larlie to detest. In things euidentlye
wicked; (...) must have compassion, and humble our selves f^ the faults of our
neighbor as for our own; a^ pray unto God for their amendment with t^ same
heart and good will, as we would do for o^^ selves, if we wear subject to the
same defects.

But what shall we be able to do, (say you) f^^ to get this spirit of such
Humility as you ha^^ declared unto us? O: there is no other means attain to
it, then to all other virtues, which are not ^eyned, but by reiterating of
their acts. Humility ^^keth us to annihilate our selves in all things, ^ich
are not necessary for our advancement in ^ce; as to speak well, to have a
gracious behau^^r, great tale^ts for menaging of exterior things, ^reat
spirit of eloquence, and the like; for these ^^^eriour things, we ought to
desire, that others ^ould do them better then we our selves.

THE FIFTH ENTERTAINMENT.
OF GENEROSITIE.
THe better to understand what it is, and wherein consists this strength and
Generositie of ^^ritt, which you demand of me; first a question (...) you
have made to me very often, must be ^nswered: to wit, in what true Humility
consi^^^th? for so much as resolving this point, I shall ^ake my self the
better to be understood, spea^^ng of the second, that is, of the Generositie of
which you now desire that I treat.

1. Humility is not any other thing, then a ^erfect knowledge that we are no
other the^ a pure nothing, and it causes us to hold this esteem of ^ur
selves: the better to understand this, you must now, that there are in us, two
kinds or sorts of ^oods, some, which are in us, and of us; and others which
are in us, but not of us. when I say we have ^oods which are of us; I do not
say, that they ^ome not from God, and that we have them of our ^elues; for in
veritye of our selves, we have no other thing then miserye and nothing, but
this I mean, that they are goods which God has so placed in us, that they
seem to be of us; these goods are health, riches, sciences, arts, and the
like. Now Humili^^ hinders us from glorifying, and esteeeming o^^ selves for
theses goods, for so much as it makes (...) more account of them, then of
nothing, ye a me^ nothing: and in effect reason does make it clea^ these goods
not being of any stabilitie, nor re^dri^^ us more acceptable to God but
mutable, and subi^^^ to fortune: and if it wear not so, there is nothing less
assurance then riches which depend of time a^ seasons; the^ beauty which
fades in let the^ nothin^ a little dirt on the face is sufficient to take away
(...) the luster thereof, and concerning sciences and art^ little trouble of
the brain, causes us to loose a^ forgett all that we have known; Is it not
the^ gre^ reason, that humility make no reckoning of all (...) foresayed
goods? but how much the more it cause^ us, to abase our selves, by the
knowledge of wh^ we are of our selves, and by the little esteem that makes of
all that is in us, and of us: so much the more does it cause us, to esteem our
selves becau^^ of the goods which are in us, and not of us; which a^ faith,
hope, and the love of God, how little soeue^ we have of them in us; as also a
certain capacit^ which God has given us, to unite our selves to hi^ by means
of his grace, and touching us, our vocati^ which gives us as much assurance
(as we can hau^ thereof in this life) of the possession of Glory an^ eternal
felicity; and this great esteem that humility makes of these goods, to wit
faith, hope an^ charity, is the foundation of Generositie of spiritt^ Behold
the^ the first goods whereof we have spok^^ appertain to humility for her
exercise: and these other to Generositie for hers. Humility makes v^ believe
that we are able to do nothing, in respec^ of the knowlegd os our poverty,
and weakness in so much as is of our selves: and on the contrary Generositie
makes us say with S. Paul; I can do al^ things in him that comforts me.
Humility makes ^o distrust our selves; and Generositie causes us to ^ide in
God. You see the^ that these two virtues of ^^militie and Generositie are so
joined and united (...) one with the other, that they never are nor ca^
separated. There are certain persons, who rely ^po^ a false and childish
Humility which hinders (...) from regarding in themselves, that good which
god ^^^h placed there: They are very much deceived; for ^^e gifts that God has
endowed us with all, should acknowledged, esteemed and greatly honored; and ^t
held in the same ra^ke of base esteem; which we ^^ght to hold of those, that
are with in us and of us. ^ot only true christians have acknowledged, that
^^ey ought to regard these two sorts of goods, which are in us, the one kind
to humble us, the other (...) glorify the Divine bou^tie, which bestowed the^
upon us: but also the Philosophers: for this word (...) common among them,
know thy self, ought not ^ely to be understood of the knowledge of our ^itye
and misery; but likewise of the excellencye ^d dignitye of our souls, who are
capable to be ^ited to the Divinity, by his Divine bountye who ^^th settled a
certain instinct in us the which cau^th us allwaies to tend to, and pretend
this union. ^herein consists all our felicitye.

. 2. The Humility which does not produce (...) enerositie, undoubtedly is
false for after that she ^^th said, I can do nothing, I am no other then a
^ure nothing, she yealdeth immediatlye the place to ^enerositye of spirit, the
which says; There is not any thing, neither can there be any thing to be had
^^at is not in my power, for so much as I put all my ^onfidence in God, who can
do all: and upon this ^o^fide^ce, she enterpriseth courageously to perform
^l that they command her. But mark thar I say all ^^at is commanded her, or
cou^selled, how difficult soe^er it be: for I ca^ assure you that Humility
judges it not to be a thing impossible for her to wo^ miracles, being
commanded so to do: if she her self to the execution of the commaundem^^^ in
simplicity of heart, God will rather work a ^^racle, then be wanting to give
her ability to ac^^^plish her enterprise: because she did not vndert^^^^ the
action upon any other aid, then upon co^fide^ce she has in his streingth:
yea she is gro^^ded upon the estimation that she has of the g^ that God has
imparted unto her and so she mak^ this discourse within her self: if God do
call to so high an estate of perfection, that there is (...) more high estate
in this life, what is that wh^ shall hinder me to attain there unto, since the
am most assured that he, who has begu^ the wo^ of my perfection, will perfect
it? but take heed t^ this be done with out any presumption: for so m^ as this
confidence hinders not, but that we m^ allwaies keep our selves upon our
guard, for fe^^^ of being deceived; but rather it makes us m^ attentive over
our selves, more vigilant and ca^^full to do that, which may serve us for the
adu^cement of our perfection. Humility consists (...) only in the distrust
of our selves, but also that confide in God: and the diffide^ce of our selves
(...) of our ownne forces, produces confidence in G^^ and from this confidence
springs Generositie (...) spirit of which we speak.

3. The most holy virgin Our Bl. Lady (...) furnish us with a most remarkable
example for t^^ subject, when she pronu^ced these words; Beho^^ the hand maid
of our Lord, be it done to (...) according to thy word: for in that she
says, t^^ servant of our Lord, she makes an act of the great humility that
she could do for so much as she o^posed against the praises that the Angel
gave h^ that she should be the mother of God, that (...) ch^^d which should be
borne of her should be called Son of the most High (the greatest dignity,
(...) ever had been or could be imagined:) she oppo^^^ (I say) to all these
praises and greatnesses, her ^enes and unworthiness, saying she was the hand^yd
of our Lord. But consider that after she had ^^^dred her due to humility, she
practiced incon^^ntly a most excellent act of Generositie, saying: ^t it be
done to me according to thy word. It is ^e (as if she would have said) that I
am not in (...) sort capable of this grace, if respect be had to ^^at I am of
my self; but since that which is good ^ne is of God, and that which thou
tellest me is most holy will, I believe that he is able, and that will effect
it; and therefore she said, Let it be ^he to me as thou have said.

. 4. Likewise for want of this Generositie, ^y few acts of true contrition are
made; for so^^ch ^ch as after we be humbled and confounded, ^ore the divine
majesty in consideration of our ^at infidelitye, we approach not to make an act
confidence, in taking heart by the assurance we ^^ght to have, that the divine
bounty will give us (...) grace, from henceforth to be more faithful to ^n,
and to correspo^d more perfectly to his divine ^^e. After this act of
confidence should imme^tlye follow; that of Generositie, saying, since that ^m
most assured that the grace of God shall not (...) wanting to me, I will
further believe, that (...) will not permit me to fail in corresponding ^his
grace.

. 5. But you will say to me; If I be wanting (...) grace, it will also be
wanting to me. It is true, if ^en it be so, who shall assure me from this time
^rth, that I shall not fail to cooperate with grace ^nce I have so oftentimes
heretofore let it pass (...) releslie? I aunsvvere that Generositie causes
the soul boudly to say, without any fear no, I wi^^ no more vnfaytfull to
God; and because she feel^ in her heart this resolution of never being disloy^
she undertakes with out any fear, all that she k^^weth is in her power to
yeald acceptable service God, with out exception: and enterpriseing all, (...)
believes she has abilitye for all, not of her se^^ but in God, upon whom
she has fixed her c^^fidence: therefore she attempteth what soeue^ commanded
or councelled her.

. 5. But you will demand of me, if it be ne^ permitted to doubt, whether we
be capable or (...) to do those things that are commanded us aunsweere, that
Generositie of spirit, does ne^ permit us to enter into any doubt. To this
end y^^ must distinguish, (as I have been accoustome^ tell you) the superior
part of your souls from, inferior: Now when I say that Generositie does (...)
permit us to doubt, this is as touching the Su^^riour part: for it may very
well be that the inferi^^^ will be top full of doubts, and will have much
di^^cultye to receive the charge, or employment tha^ appointed us. But for all
this, the soul that is Ge^^rous scorneth it, and maked no account ther-of;
(...) simply puts her self to the exercise of the cha^ not so much as
speaking one word, nor shew^ any action to discover the feeling she has of
(...) incapacitie. But we poor creatures, are so ioyf^^ as of nothing more, to
witness that we are v^ humble, and that we have a base esteem of our selu^
and the like things, which are nothing less the true humility, which does
never permit us to re^ the judgment of those whom God has given us be our
Guides I have put in the book of the int^^duction an example which serves to
my purpo^^ and which is very remarkable: it is of king Ach^^ who being reduced
to extreme affliction, by (...) grievous war that two other kings did make
against him, having beseeged Herusalem: God co^^maunded the prophet Isaye, that
he should go to ^omfort him in his name, and to promise him he should have the
victory, and remain triumphant ^uer his enimyes. And moreover the prophet
said ^o him, that for proose of the truth of what he spoke ^e should demand
of God a sign in heaven above, ^r in the earth below, and God would grant it
him: ^hen Ac^^az distrusting the bounty of God, and his ^iberality, said, I
will not do it, for so much as (...) will not tempt God. But the miserable
man, said ^ot this for the honor he did bear to God: for ^ontrariwise, he
refused to honor him, because God would at that time be honored by miracles:
and Achaz did refuse to demand one of him, which ^e had signified unto him, he
desired to do: he ^ffended God in refusing to obey the Prophet, that God sent
to signify his will unto him. We ought ^hen never to be doubtful that we
cannot do that which is commanded, for so much as those, who ^ommaund us,
know sufficiently our capacitye.

. 6. But you tell me, that peradventure you ^aue many interior miseries ad
imperfections, that your superiors know not of, and this that ^hey do is
upon exterior apparences, by the which it may be you have deceived their
spiritts. I ^ay, we must not allwaies believe what you say, ^ushed forwards
it may be with discouragment, that you are miserable, and wholly filled with
im^erfections; no more the^ we must believe that you ^aue them not, when you
say nothing of them, they ^rdinarilie being such as your works make them
^ppeare. Your virtues are known by the fidelity ^ou have in practicing of
them, and even so imper^ections are known by their acts. We cannot, as ^ong
as we feel no malice in our heart deceive the spirit of our superiors.

. 7. But you tell me that we see many Sts. make great resistance, that they
might not receive those offices and charges others would have given them. That
which they have done, has not been only, because of the base esteem they had
of themselves; but principally because they did see, that those that would have
them undertake these charges grounded themselves upon apparent virtues, as are
fastings, Almees deeds, pena^ces and austerities of body, and not upon the
true interior virtues, which they kept close, and covert under holy
humility; and they wear sought ont, and followed by the poeple, who did not
know them otherwise then by the fame they heard of their virtue: in this case,
it should be (as it seeemeth) permitted to make some resista^ce: but do you
know to whom? I will tell you. To a Religious of Dijon, for example, to whom
a Superior of Anessy should send commandment to be Superior, having never
seen nor known her. But a Religious of that place, to whom she should make
the same commandment, should never endeavor to bring any testimony, that she
is repugnant to the commandment: but rather she should endeavor to put her
self to the exercise of her charge, with as much peace and courage, as if she
thought her self very capable for the performance thereof. But I see very well
the craft of the devil, we fear forsoothe the success thereof will not prove
to our honor, we have our reputation in so great recommendation, that we would
not be held for learners in our charges, but for masters and Mistrisses, that
never committ faults.

. 8. You now by this understand enough, what the spirit of streingth and
Generositie is, which we so much desire should be established amongst you, to
the end it may banish all childishnes and effeminacie which serve for nothing
else, then to stop us in our way, and to hinder us from making any progress in
perfection. These tendernesses are nourisht by the vain reflectio^s we make
upon our selves, principally when we have stu^bled in our way by any fault;
for in this place by the grace of God we have never yet seen any directlye to
fall; but if they stumble now and then, and in steed of hu^bling themselves
mildly, and redressing themselves courageously (as we have said) they enter
into consideration of their poverty, and there upon they begin to
compassionate themselves saying, Alas my God! how miserable am I, I am fit for
nothing: and afterward we pass into discouragment which causes us to say: O
no, there is nothing more for to be hoped for of me, I shall never do any
thing of worth, it is time lost to speak to me: and co^sequentlie we would
almost that they should leave us there, as if they weere very well assured
never to be able to gain any thing with us. Good God how far are all these
things from the soul that is generous, and who makes a great esteem, as we
have said, of the talentes God has endowed her with all? for she is not
astonished either at the difficultyes of the way, she has to go, or at the
greatness of the work, or the leanght of time that must be employed therein,
or in fine at the delaying of the work which she has undertaken. The
Religious of the Visitation are all called to most great perfection, and their
enterprise is the most high and excellent that can be thought of: for so much
as they have not only the pretense in uniting themselves to the will of God,
as all creatures ought to do; but moreover their pretensio^ is to unite
themselves to his desires, yea even unto his intentions, I say, even in a
manner before they be scarce signified unto them, and if they could conceive
what vveere more perfect, and one degree of perfection more the^ to conform
themselves to the will of God, his desires, and intentions, they would with out
doubt undertake to mount thereunto; since they have a vocation, which obliges
the^ thereunto and therefore their devotion ought to be a strong and generous
devotion, as we have said many times.

. 7. But besides this that we have said of this Generositie, this must further
more be declared here to wit, that the soul which possesses it, receaueth
equally dryness of spirit, and sweetness of consolations; interior
anguishes, vexations, and oppressions of spirit. as the favors and
prosperity of a spirit, filled with peace and tranquillity; and this because
she co^sidereth, that he which gives her the consolations, is the very same
that sends her afflictions, who sends the one and the other with the same
love, which she her self acknowledges to be exceedingly great: because that
by the interior affliction of the spirit, he pretends to draw her to most
high perfection, which is the abnegation of all sorts of co^solatio^s in this
life: remaining most assured that he who has deprived her of them in this
world, will not eternally deprive her of the^ in the height of heaven. You
will say to me, that we cannot in the thickett of these great darknesses make
these considerations: seeing as it seems; we cannot speak so much as one
only word unto our Lord truly you have reason to say, as it seems to you,
for so much as in verity it is not so. The sacred council of Trent has
determined this, and we are obliged to beleaue it, that God and his grace do
never aba^don us in such sort, that we cannot have recourse to his bounty, and
protest that against all the trouble and wrestling of our soul, we will be
wholly his, and that we will not willingly offend him. But mark well, all
this is in the superior part of our soul, and because the inferior
perceaueth not any thing at all of this, but that she remains always in
her pain, that is it, that troubles us, and makes us to esteem our selves
very miserable: and further more we begin to bemoane our selves excessiuelye as
if it wear a thing very worthy of compassion, to see our selves with out
consolation. Alas, Alas, for Gods sake let us consider, how our Lord and
master has very willingly been exercised by these interior anguishes, and
that beyond all imagination. Let us ^harke^ unto those words that he spoke
upon the cross: My God, m^ God, why have thou forsaken me? he was reduced to
so great extremity that he had no other thing left the^ the point of the
spirit, which was not over whelmed with dolours: but yet consider that he
^etaketh himself to speak to God, for to show us, (...) it should not be
impossible for us to do the same

. 8. Which is better say you, at this time, to speak ^o God of our grief,
and misery, or else to speak ^o him of some other matter? I tell you that in
this ^afe, as in all sorts of temptations, it is better to di^ert our spirit
from the vexation and trouble ther-of ^iscoursing with God of some other thing,
then to ^^eake to him of our vexation: for undoubtedly if ^e do it, it will
not be with out a kind of bemo^ing and tenderness over our heart, augmenting a
^evv our grife; our nature being such, as it cannot ^^e or think of her
dolours with out having great ^ompassion of them. But you say to me except you
^e attentive to your greifes, you shall not remem^er then how to declare them,
and what matter is (...) truly we are as children, who are very glad to ^e to
their mother, if a Be have stung them, to ^ll it her, to the end she may
bemoane them, and ^ow upon the place, which is already whole: for (...)
willingly go to our mother to tell her we have been very much afflicted, and
we aggrauate our affliction, recounting the very least things, not omitting any
little circumstance which may cause us to be bemoaned a little: Now do you not
see this extreme childishnes? if we have committed any infidelity, it is
good to declare it, if we have been faithful it must be also told, yet
breiflie, with out exaggerating either the one or the other, for all ought to
be declared to those that have charge of our souls.

. 9. You will say now, that when you have had a great motion of choler, or of
any other tentation there allwaies comes some scruple into your mind unless
you confess it I say it ought t^ be spoken in the reuewe of our selves, but
not by way of confession: but for instruction how to co^port our selves in the
like occasions, I say, when we do not clearelie see, that we have given some
kind of consent; for if you say: I accuse my sel^ that two days together I
have had great motion of choler, but I consented not there unto, you d^clare
your virtues, in place of telling your faulte^ but if I be in doubt whether I
have committe^ some fault therein or no: I must consider man^^elie if this
doubt have any ground: it may be, the about a quarter of an hour, in the space
of the two days you have been somewhat negligent (...) diuerting your thoughts
from that motion; if it (...) so tell simply, that you have been negligent in
d^uerting your self from a motion of choler th^^ you have had, during the
space of a quarter of (...) hour, with out adding the tentation has con^^nued
two days: except you would say it either (...) receive some instruction from
your Confessor, (...) otherwise because it is of your ordinary reuew^ for
then it is very good to declare it. But for or^^narie, confessions, it will be
better not to speak of since you do it to no other end then to satisfy your
selves, and if it put you to some little pain in not doing it; it ought to be
suffered, as some other accident, in which we are not able to procure redress.
God be Blessed.

LIVE JESUS.
THE SIXTH ENTERTAINMENT OF HOPE.
UPON THE DEPARTVRE OF THE Visitation, that went to found a new house of their
Institute.
1. AMong the praises the Holy Saints have given to Abraham S. Paul extolleth
this above all the rest, that he increased in Hope against hope, it self; God
Almighty had promised him, that ^is seed should be multiplied as the stars of
heaven, and as the sands of the sea: yet notwithstanding he received a
commandment to sacrifice his son Isaac: poor Abraham did not loose his
Hope for this; but he expected beyond hope it self, that being obedient to
the commandment given him of sacrificing his son, God would not therefore
fail to perform his promise made to him great truly was his hope: for in no
sort did ^he see where-on it might depend, but only upon the word which God
had given him. O; that word of God is a most true and solid ground and
foundation, for it is infallible; Abraham then proceeded to accomplish the will
of the of God with an incomparable simplicity; for he made no more
consideration, nor reply, then he did when God had commanded him, saying: go
forth out of thy country, an^ from thy kindred, and go to the place that I wi^
show thee, not specifying it unto him, to the en^ he should imbarke himself,
most simply in the ship of his Divine providence: walking then forwards three
days and three nights, with his sonn^ Isaac, carrying the wood for the
sacrifice, this Innocent soul demanded of his Father where wa^ the
Holocaust? to whom good Abraham answered; My son, our Lord will provide
it. O^ good God how happy should we be, if vv^ could accustom our selves
to make this answer to our hearts, when they are in care for any thing our
Lord will provide therefore, and that after the we had not any more anxietie,
trouble, or impression, then Isaac had: for he held himself silent an^ quiett,
believing our Lord would provide, even a^ his father had said; Certaynelye God
requiret^ that the confidence we have in his fatherly ca^ and Divine
Providence should be great: But wherefore should we not have it? seeing there
has never been any person deceived therein, nor an^ one confided in God that
has not received the fruit of his confidence. I speak this amongst o^^selues;
for touching these of the world, their confidence is accompagnied with
apprehension; an^ therefore is of no vvorth before God. Let us consider I
beseech you, what Our Lord and Maiste^ said to his Apostles, to establish in
them this hol^ and loving Confidence. I have sent you into the world with out
scrip, money, or other provisions either for yout nourishment or clothing, has
ther^ been any thing vvanting to you? and they saved no^ go, said he, to
them, and meditate not in you^ mind, whereof you shall eat, or what you sha^^
drink, or where with you shall be clothed, no^ likewise what you shall
speak being in the pre^ence of the great Lords and magistrates of the pro^inces
through which you shall pass: for in every ^ccasion your heavenly Father
will provide for ^ou, all that is necessary; neither do you preme^itate
what you shall speak, for he will speak in ^ou, and put into your mouth the
words that you shall have to say. But I am so dull, and ill-spoke^ (some one
of our sisters will say) I know not how to ^onuerse with great ones, and
Noble poeple, I have ^o learning: that is all one, go, and confide in God: ^or
he has said. Although a vvoma^ should happen ^o forgett her child yet will I
never forgett) you: ^or I bear you engraven in my heart, and on my ^ands;
Think you that he who has care to provide food for the fowls os the air,
and the ^eastes of the earth, which neither sovv nor ga^her into barnes, can
ever forgett to provide all that shall be necessary for the man that vvil
con^ide totallie in his Providence, since that man ^s capable to be united to
God our Souueraigne good?

. 2. This my most dear Sisters has seemed good to me to speak to you upon
this subject of your departure; for although you are not capa^le of
Aposto^icall dignity because of your sex; nevertheless you are in some sort
capable of the Apostolical office and you may render many services to God,
procuring in some sort the advancement of his glory as the Apostles did.
Certaynelie, my Dear Daughters, this ought to be a moriue of great consolation
unto you, that God will serve him self of you for so excellent a work as this
to which you are called, and you ought to should your selves greatly honored
before the Divine majesty. For what is that, that God desires of you, but
that which he did orda^ne to his Apostles? and that for which he sent them into
the world, which was that for which our Lord himself came to work in this
world, to wit, to give life to men, and not only this, said he, but to the
end they should live more abundantly, that they may have life and better life,
which he has wrought by giving the^ his grace: The Apostles were sent of our
Lord throughout the world for the same subject: for our Lord said unto them,
even as my Father sent me I send you: go and give life to men; but you must
not content your selves with this, but endeavor that they live, and that a most
perfect life; by the means of the doctrine that you shall teach them they
shall have life in believing my word that you expose to them: but they shall
have more abundant life by the good example that you shall give them and
therefore take no care whether your labors fructify according to your
pretended desire, for it is not of you the fruits shall be demanded, but only
whether you have employed your selves faithfully to cultiuate the sterill and
dry ground: it will not be demanded whether you have had a good harvest: but
only if you have had care to sow well. In like manner my dear daughters you
are now commanded to go hither and thither, into diverse places to the end
that souls having life, by your means may live a better life, for what is
that which you go to do, but to give knowledge of your Institute, and by
means of this knowledge to dravve many souls, to embrace all the obseruances,
which are comprised and contained therein! but with out preaching and
conferring the Sacraments, and remitting sins as the Appostles did. Go you
not to give life to men? but to speak more properly; go you not to give life
to women; since it may be a hundred and a hundred virgins which would have
been lost in the world, shall by your example, retyring them selves with in
your Religion, go to enjoy in heaven for all eternity, incomprebe^sible
felicitye: and not this by your means, that their life shall be ^uen them, and
that they shall live a more abun^ant life, that is to say, a life more perfect
and ^easing to God, a life that shall make them capable ^ unite themselves more
perfectly to the divine ^ountie: for they shall receive from you necessary
^^structions, for to attain the true and pure love ^f God, with is that more
abundant life, which ^ur Lord JESUS is come to give to men? I have ^rought,
said he, fire into the earth, what is that I ^emaund, or what do I prretend,
but that it bur^e? And in another place he commands that fire ^urne
continually upon his Altar, and therefore ^^at it should never be put out, to
show with what ^rdour he desires that the fire of his love be all^aies
kindled upon the Altar of our hearts. O God, that a grace is this, that God
does bestow on ^ou? he makes you Apostles, not in dignity, but in ^ffice and
meritt, you preach not, for your sex is ^ot permitted it, although S. Marie
Magdalene, and S. Martha her Sister has done it, but you ^mitt not therefore
to exercise the Apostolical ^ffice, in the communicatio^ of your manner of
life, ^uen so as I say. Go then with courage to accom^lish that to which you
are called, but go in sim^licitye; if you have apprehensions, say to your
^oules, Our Lord will provide for us if the conside^ation of your weakness
disharten you; cast your ^elues into the arms of God, and confide in him. The
Apostles for the most part weere sinners and ^gnorant, God made them learned,
according as ^as necessary for the charge that he would give ^^em: do you
therefore confide in him, depend ^ppon his providence and fear nothing: do
not ^^y. I have not the tale^t to discourse well, it imports not, go with
out making discourse: for go^ will give you that which you shall have to say,
an^ to do when it shall be time, if you have indeed ^^ virtue, or at least
perceive none in you, let it n^ trouble you; for if you enterprise for the
Glory (...) God: and the fulfilling of obedience, the gouerme^ of souls, or
any other exercise whatsoever it be God will have care of you, and shall be
obliged (...) provide for you all that shall be necessary, aswe^ for you, as for
those God has given you in charg^ it is true that this which you undertake is
a matt^^ of great consequence and importance; but ho^ soever you should do
amiss, if you would n^^ expect good success, since you do not inte^prise it,
by your own choice, but for your oblig^tion to Obedience. Without doubt we
have gre^^ cause to fear when we seek after offices and cha^ges, be it in
Religion, or other where, and th^^ they be granted us through our importune
sui^^ but when it is not so: Let us bow humbly o^ neck under the yoke of
holy Obedience, and Le^^ us accept of the burden with a good heart humbling our
selves, for this ought allwaies to be practiced: but let us always remember
to establis^ Generositie upon the acts of humilitye, for with out it, these
acts of humility are vvorth no^thing.

. 3. I have an extreme desire to grave i^ your hearts one maxim, which is of
incomparable profitt: not to ask any thing, nor to refu^^ any thing: no my
Dear Children demand nothing, nor refuse nothing: receive that which the^
will give you, and do not demand what the^ shall not present, or that they
will not give you in this practice you shall find great peace to you^ souls;
yea, my Dear Sisters, hold your hearts t^ this holy indifferency, to receive
all they will ^iue you, and not to desire that which they will ^ot give you:
I say in a word desire nothing, ^ut leave your selves, and all your affairs
totally and perfectly to the care of the Divine Providence: ^ermitt him to do
with you; even as Children ^aue themselves to be governed by their Nourses,
(...) it carrye you on the right arm or on the ^eft, let it all be as it
shall please him, for a child ^ould not be discontented thereat* whether ^
bring you to bed, or raise you from bed, let it ^one for it is a good mother,
that knovveth better ^vhat you want, then you your selves. I advise ^ou, if
the Divine providence permit, that affli^tion or mortifications happen to you,
not to ^efuse them: rather accept them with a loving and peaceful heart: and if
they be not sent you ^y it, or that it be not permitted that they happen unto
you: desire them not, nor ask for them: ^kevvise if consolations or comfortes
be given ^ou, receive them with the spirit of gratitu^e, and thanksgiving to
the Divine bounty: and if you have them not, do not desire them, ^ut
endeavor to have your heart prepared to ^eceaue the diuersitye of events from
the Diui^e Providence with an equal heart as much as ^ay be. If in Religion
they appoint obediences ^o you, which seem dangerous for you, as ^re those of
superioritye, refuse them not if they ^re not appointed you, desire them not,
and ^uen so of all things, I mean of things of this ^vorld for so far as
concerns virtues, we may and ought to ask the^ of God: and the love of God
^omprehendeth them all. You cannot believe until ^ou have experienced it, how
much profitt the ^ractice of this will bring to your souls; for in pla^e of
musing to desire now these means, and after others to perfect your selves, you
will apply yo^ selves more simply, and fayt fully, to those the will encounter
you in your way.

. 4. Casting my eyes upon the subject ^ your departure, and upon the
inevitable feelin^ that every one of you shall have, in being s^parat^ one
from an other, I thought my self bound (...) m^ke some little speech to you,
to lessen yo^ grief, although I will not say, that it is not law^full to weep
^ little, for it must be done, for ^ much as ye shall not be able to restrain
it, haui^^ remained so sweetly and lovingly together, a lo^^ time in the
practice of one and the same exercise^ the which has so united your hearts
that with o^ doubt they cannot suffer any division or separation My Dear
Sisters, you shall not be divided n^ separated, for all go, and all remain;
those th^^ go remain; and those that remain go; not i^ their person: but in
the person of those that go^ and likewise those that shall go, shall remain ^
the person of those that remain, this is one of the principal fruits of
Religion (to wit) this holy vnio^ that is made by charity; which is such an
vni^ that of many hearts there is but one heart, and o^ many members there is
made but one body: all a^^ so made one in Religion; that all the Religious ^
one order (as it seems) are but one only Rel^gious. The lay Sisters sing
the Divine Office in the person of those that are dedicated to the Quire, an^
the quire Nu^nes serve in domestical offices in the person of those who do
them: and even so the reason is most evident. For so much as if those tha^ are
in the quire, to sing the office, wear not ther^ the others should be there in
their place, and and ^ they had not domestical Sisters to dress the^ dinner,
the Sisters of the Quire should be imploye^ therein: and if such a Sister wear
not superior, the there should be another: even so those who do ^e, do
remain, and those who remain go: for ^^ose that be named to go, could not
perform those that remain should go in their place: but ^t which ought cause
you either to go or re^^yne willingly, my dear daug^ters, is, the almost
^allible assurance which we ought to have, that ^s separation is made no
otherwise then touching (...) body, for touching the spirit you remain ^^st
perfectly united; this corporal separation is ^ a small matter, the which
will be done, will we, ^ will we not: but the separation of hearts and ^nion of
spiritts, this is it alone that is to be fea^. Now touching us, we will not
only remain ^ted together: but further more this our union ^ll every day
increase to more perfection, and ^t most sweet and amiable bond or cord of
^ritie shall be always more twisted and tied ^ether, according to the measure
that we shall ^ance our selves, in the way of our own perfe^^^on: for as much
as becoming more capable to ^te our selves to God, the more we shall unite ^^r
selves one to and other, so that by every ^^mmunion that we make, our union
shall be made ^re perfect: for uniting our selves with our Lord ^ shall allwaies
remain more united together: ^o the receiving of this sacred and celestial
Bread (...) of this most odoriferous Sacrament is called ^^mmunion, that is as
much to say, as, common ^on. O good God, what an union is that, which ^etweene,
each Religious of one and the same ^er; such an union that their spiritual
riches are ^ntermixed together, and reduced into common, their exterior
provisions are. A Religious person ^h nothing in particular to himself,
because of ^e sacred vow that he has made, of voluntary ^^uertie, and by the
holy profession that Religious make of most holy charity, all their virtues
are ^^^mon, and all participat of the good works (...) one an other, and shall
enjoy the fruit of (...) same: provided that they keep themselves allwai^^ in
charity, and in observance of those Rules ^ Religion whereunto God has
called them; that that person which is in any domestical o^^ce, or in any
other exercise what soever it be, co^templateth in the person of her that is
in pray in the quier: she that reposeth, participateth of (...) labor another
has, who is in exercise by (...) commandment of the Superior. Behold th^^
my dear Children, how those that go, do ^^mayne, and those who remain do
go, a^ therefore you ought all equally, lovingly and co^ragiously to embrace
Obedience as well in this ^^casio^ as in all others, since those who do
remay^^ shall have part of the labor and fruit of the vo^^ge of those who
depart: even as they shall have p^ of the tranquillity and quiet of those who
rem^^ne. Doubtless all of you, my Dear children, ha^^ need of much virtue,
and of great care to prac^^ it, as well to depart, as to stay. For even as they
vv^ depart, have need of much courage and conside^^ in God, louinglye and with
the spirit of humil^^ to enterprise that which God requires of the^
vanquis^ing all the feelings which may lay ho^ or come upon them to leave the
house, in vvh^^ God has first placed them, the Sisters they ha^ so dearly
loved, and whose conversation broug^^ so much consolation to their soul; the
tranqu^litye of their retired life, which is so dear, the parents and
acquaintance, and I know not vv^ many other things, to which nature is tied
w^les that we live in this life, They likewise vv^ remain have the same need
and necessitye ^ courage, asvvell to persevere in the practice ^ h^y
submission, humility, and tranquillitye, as ^^ to prepare themselves, to go
forth when ^y shall be commanded: since that even as you (...), your Institute,
My Dear sisters, begins ^ extend it self into all parts in so many diverse
^ces: in like manner you ought to endeavor, ^ increase and multiply the acts
of your virtue, ^^d to stringhten your courage, for to make your ^ues capable
to be employed, according to the ^ill of God.

. 5. Truly it seems to me, when I regard ^^d consider the beginning of
your Institute, that ^verye well represents the history of Abra^^m: for
when God had given his word to him; ^t his seed should be multiplied ^s the
stars of ^^e firmament, and as the sands of the sea: he ^^mmaunded him
nevertheless to sacrifice his ^^nne: by whom the promise of God was to ^
accomplished. Abraham did hope and strengh^^n himself in his hope, against
hope it self, ^^d his hope was not in vain, but fruitful: in ^^e manner
when the first three Sist^rs did rank ^^emselues together, and embra^e this
kind (...) life, God had designed from all eternity to ^esse their g^neration,
in giving them one who should be great^ie multyplied: but who could have
^^leeued this? since when they enclosed them^^lues with in their little
house, we thought ^o other thing then to make them dye to the ^orld? they
wear not sacrificed, but they did ^oluntarilie sacrifice themselves, and God
con^nted himself so must with their sacrifice, ^at he has not only given
them a new life ^r them selves: but a life so abundant, that they ^ay by his
grace communicate it to many sou^s, even as we allreadie see. And truly it
seems to me that these three first Sisters, ^ very well represented by the
three graine^ wheat that wear found among the straw, w^^ was put on the
chariott of Triptolemus, the w^^ grains did serve to conserve his army. For
b^ brought into a country, where there was not ^ wheat, these three grains
wear taken, and cast ^ the ground, which did produce others in such qu^titie,
that with in a few years all the grounde^ that country wear sowed there
with. The Pro^^dence of our good God casting with his ble^^^^ hand these three
Religious into the ground of Visitation: and having remained there somt^ hidden
from the eyes of the world, they have p^^duced the fruit that we see at this
present: in (...) sort that within a short time, all this country sh^^^ made
participant of your Institute. O how hap^^^ are those souls who dedicate
themfelues truly ^ absolutely to the service of God? for God ne^^ leaves them
barren nor unfruitful; for, for a v^^ nothing that they have leaft for God:
God giu^^ them incomparable recompenses, as well in this ^ as in the other.
What a grace is this I pray y^^ to be employed in the service of souls, whom
G^^ has so dearelye loved, and for whose salvation o^ Lord JESUS has suffered
so much? truly it is inestimable honor, and you ought) my dear ch^^dren) to
make a very great esteem thereof, and ^ employ your selves f^ythfully therein,
not co^pl^ning neither of pain nor care, nor labor: for y^ shall be most
dearly recompensed for all, allthou^^ this ought not to serve as a motive to
encourage y^ but rather, because by the same you become mo^^ pleasing to God,
and thereby augment his Glorie^ much the more; Go then, and remain
courag^ouslie in this exercise, and do not study to co^^^d^^ that you see not
in your selves what is necessary, means talentes proper for the offices you
shall be ^^ployed in: it is hetter that you do not see them ^our selves, for
this will keep you in humilitye, ^ give you more ample subject to distrust
your ^^^es, and your own forces, and cause you more ^^^olutelie to put your
whole confidence in God; ^o much that as long as we have not necessity to
^^^ctice a virtue, it is better we have it not: when (...) shall have use
thereof (provided that we be ^^^thfull in those that we have present practice
of) ^ us hold our selves assured that God will give every virtue in his time;
let us not study to de^^, nor to pretend any thing, let us indeed leave ^^r
selves wholy in the hands of the divine pro^^^ence that he do with us
what shall please him: (...) to what purpose is it, to desire one thing
rather ^^n another ought not all things to be indifferent to us? provided that
we please God, and that we ^^ue his divine will, this ought to suffice us.
For ^^y part, I admire how it can be, that we should ^^ue more inclination
to be employed in one thing ^^en in another; principally being in Religion,
^here one charge, and one business is as pleasing ^ God as another: since it is
Obedience that gives ^^e prise to all the exercises of Religion: if the choice
^eare given us the most abject should be the ^ost desirable, and these we
should embrace most ^^uingly; but this not being in our choice, let us ^^brace
the one and the other with the same hearty ^ood will: when the charge that is
given us is hono^^ble before men: let us hold our selves humble before God:
when it is more abject before men, ^^tt us esteem our selves more honored
before the ^iuine Bounty.

. 6. In fine, my dear daughters, retain chere^ully and faithfully, that which
I have said to you, ^vhether it respect the interior, or the exterior, will
nothing but what God would have yo^ will: embrace lovingly the events ad
diverse eff^ of his divine will, not troubling your heads ab^ any other thing,
and now what can I say more, dear Sisters, since it seems that all our
happi^ is comprised in this most amiable practice? on^ I will represent to you
the example of the Isra^ with the which I will end: they having belong time
with out a king, had a desire to have (great certaynelie is the spirit of
humayne esti^tion) as if God had left them with out a guide that he had not
had care to Rule, govern, and fend them, for this cause they did address
themselves to the Prophett, who promised in the name to demand one for them
of God; the vvh^ he did, and God being irritated with their dema^ made them
this aunsvvere, that he would gr^ their request: but that he should advertise
the^, ^^ the king that they should have, should take s^ dominion over them,
that he should take their ch^dren from them, and as for their sons, he sho^
make some of them, under officers, others sodiers, and captains, and for their
daug^ters, ^ should make some of them cooks, others Bake^ and others
perfumers: O^r Lord does the sam^ Most dear daughters, to those who dedicate
themselves unto his service, for (as you see in Religion their are diverse
charges, and diverse offices: but vvh^ is it that I will say? no other thing,
but that it seems to me, that the divine Majesty has chose^ you, who are
to go, as perfumers, yea truly, for you are deputed by him, to go and
power for^ the most svveete savor of the virtues of your Institute; and as
young damsells are lovers of svveet^ smelles, ^as the sacred spouse says in
the Ca^ticles that the name of her be oued is an oil or ba^me^ which spredeth
all over its Odoriferous and fragran^ savor for this cause she adds, the
young ^ells, have follovved him (being drawn by his ^^e perfumes) My dear
sisters, as perfumers of ^uine bounty, go your way to power forth ^igh all
parts the incomparable odor of Most ^re humility, sweetness, and Charity;
that many ^g maidens may be drawn, to follovv after perfumes, and to embrace
your manner of life, ^ich they may be able, as yourselues, to enjoy in ^fe a
holy and amorouse peace and tra^quillie of ^, and by this means, in the other
life, to possess ^all felicitye. Your congregation is as a hiue of the which
has all ready cast diverse swarms: ^euerthelesse with this difference, that
the come forth to retire themselves with in ano^iue, and there to begin a new
household, ^ swarm choising their particular king under ^me they fight, and
make their retraite: but tou^ you, my dear souls, although you go vvith^evv
hiue (that is to say, begin a new house ^ur order) nevertheless you have
always the same king, that is our Lord JESUS Crucified: ^r whose authority
you shall live in security ^^resoeuer you shall be* fear not the want of
thing, for he will be always with you, so as you do not make choice of
another: only ^a great care to increase your love and fidelity ^s divine
Goodness, hold your selves as near ^m as you can possibly, and all yvill
succeed to good: learn of him to do all that you shall to do, and do
nothing without his council, ^e is the most faithful friend, who vvil con^
govern, and have care of you, as with my ^^le heart, I humbly beeseech him.
God be ^^ed.

LIVE JESUS.
THE SEVENTH ENTERTAYNMENT.
WHEREIN THE PROPERTI^ of Doves are applied to the Religious sou^ by way of
Laws.
1. YOu have demanded of me some i^ Laws, in the beginning of the year,
considering what might be most profitable convenient for you; I have cast the
eyes of my ^ration upon the Gospel of this day, vvhe^^ made mention of the
Baptism of our Lord ^ and of the Glorious apparition of the holy G^ in the
form of a Dove, upon the which appa^ I have laid hold: and considering
that the ^^ Ghost is the love of the Father, and of the Son^ have thought that
I ought to give laws all of the which I have taken from the Doves, in
co^^^deration of this, that the Holy Ghost has vo^^^safed to take the form
of a Dove: and also so (...) the more vvilinglie,, because that all the souls
v^ are dedicated to the service of the Divine Mai^ are obliged to be as chaste
and loving Doves. ^ as we see the spouse in the Canticles is often na^ by this
name; and with very good reason for t^ is a great correspondence between the
quallitie the Dove, and those of the beautiful loving D^ of our Lord, the
laws of Doves are all excee^glie agreeable: and it is a most svvete meditation
consider them. What is a more goodly lavv^ pray you, then that of cleanlines?
for their is any thing more neat then Doves: they are vvo^^ ^andsome, although
there is nothing more (...) then a doue-cote, and the place where they ^e
their nests: notvvithstanding we never see a (...) Dove, they have always
their feathers bright ^th make a delightful aspect in the sun. Let ^nsider
I pray you, how gracious the Law of (...) simplicity is? Our Lord JESUS
himself has ^^ed it, saying to his Apostles; be as simple as ^es, and as
prudent as the serpent. But in the (...) place, good God how delightful is
their (...) of sweetness. For they are with out galle, and out bitterness:
and a hundred other laws have, which are exceeding amiable and profi^ for
souls to observe who are dedicated in ^^gion, to the more peculier service of
the divine ^^tie. But I have considered, that if I give you (...) laws, that
you have allreadie had, you ^ld make small esteem of them, I have there^^
chose only three, which are of an incompa^ profitt, being well observed, and
which do ^g a very great svvetnesse to the soul who co^^eth them, because
they are all wholy of love, extreemely delicious for the perfection of ^uall
life, and are so much the more excellent ^^tayning perfection, as they are
less known (...) those that make profession to get it, at least ^he most
part: but what then are these Laws?

2. The first that I have designed to give you ^^at of the shee-doues, who do
all for their (...) and maistre Dove, and nothing for them^^s, it seems they
say no other thing but; My ^e dove is all for me, and I all his, he is all^es
inclining toward me, and I attend, and ^e my self of him, and rely on him,
let this beloved dove then fly, to seek where it plea^^ him, I will not
enter into diffide^ce, or Jealousy ^s love, but will confide fully in his
care. It may be you have seen but not marked, that shee-doues; vvhiles that
they hache, or sit on the eggs, stir not of them, until such time as the
little young ones be hasthed, and when they (...) hacthed, they continue to
cover and keep the vvarme so long as they have need, and all this t^ the he^n
goes not to gather for to nourish her se^^ but she leaves all the care to her
dear compa^^ who is so faithful to her, that he not only go^ to search out
the grains to nourish ber, but also brings water in his bill to quench her
the he has an exceeding care that nothing be vvan^ unto her that is necessary,
yea so great, that it (...) never seen that any dove did dye in this time
want of food; the Dove then does all for beloved one, she covers and
keeps her l^ ones vvarme, for the desire she has to please h^ in giving him
generation: and the cocke-D^ takes care to nourish his dear hen, who has
the care of her self to him; she has no o^ thought then to please him; and he
in countere^ thinks only how to sustain her. O what a lightfull and
profitable law is this? to do not^ but for God: and to leave all the care of
our se^ to him: I speak not only for that which re^deth the temporallitye
(for I will not speak the of, for there is none of you here, but vnders^^
this without speaking) but I speak for that w^ concerns the spirituallitye,
and the aduancen^ of our souls in perfection. Ah: do you not that the Dove
thinks nothing but of her belo^ and to please him, she moves not of her
eggs, ^ in the mean time nothing is vvantting to her recompens^ing her
confidence with his care how happy should we be, if all we did we for
our most amiable Dove the Holy Ghost! for would take the care of us, and
according to measure that our confidence, wherely we should repose in his
providence, should become more great, so much more also should his care extend
it self over all our necessities, and we should never doubt that God would
leave us: for his love is infinitt for the soul that puts her trust in him.
O ^ow happy is the Dove to have such confidence ^n her dear one! this is that
which causes her to ^iue in peace and tranquillity: A thousand times more
happy is the soul that leaves the total care of her self, and all that is
necessary for her, to her most dear and well-beloved beautiful Dove, having no
other thought, then to cover and cherish her ^ittle ones to please him and
produce him issue: for she enjoys in this life such tranquillitye and so
great peace, that there is nothing to be compared ^herevnto, nor any repose
equal to hers in this world; but only in the height of heaven, where she
shall fully for ever enjoy the chaste imbraceme^ts of her celestial Spouse.

. But what are our eggs that we must sit on until that they be hatehed, for
to have little young Doves? our eggs are our desires, the which being well
covered and cherished, the little young doves ^ome forth out of them, which are
the effects of our desires: but among our desires there is one which i^
supereminent above all the other, and deseruet^ much to be very well cherished
and covered for t^ please our Divine lover the Holy Ghost, who will allwaies be
called the sacred Spouse of our souls So great is his bountye and love toward
us. Thi^ desire is the same which we have brought with v^comming into Religion,
which is to embrace Religious virtues, it is one of the branches of the lou^ of
God, and one of the most high that are in thi^ divine tree. But this desire
must not extend it self further, then the means which are set down it our
Rules and constitutions, for to attain to this perfection which we have
pretended to gain, in obliging our selves to the persuite thereof: But it must
be cherished, and keept in the first vig or all the days of our life, to the
end that this desire may become a beautiful young dove, which may resemble her
Father, which is perfection it self: And yet we must have no other intention
then to keep our selves upon our eggs, that is to say, enclosed within the
means that are prescribed us for our perfection, leaving all the care of our
selves to our only and most amiable Dove, who will not permit that any thing
shall be wantting to us of that which shall be necessary to please him.

. Truly it is a very great pity to see souls, whereof the number is too
great, who pretending perfection imagine within themselves, that all consists
in making a multitude of desires, and constrain themselves very much to search
out now this means, and immediatlye another to attain there unto, and are
never content nor quiett in themselves for from one desire that they have, they
endeavor quickly to conceive another, and it seems they are as hens, who
having laid an egg, presently charge themselves with another, leaving the
same which they made without brooding it, i^ such sort that they have no issue
of chickens: the Dove does not so, for she covers, hatcheth, an^ cherishes
her little ones, until such time as they are capable to fly, and gather
wherewith to nourish themselves: The hen if she have little ones, i^
extreemlye sollicitous, and cease not clocking and making a noise: But the
Dove retayneth her self quiert, and patient, she clocketh not, nor troubles
not her self: even so there are some souls, wh^ cease not to clock, and to
enforce themselves afte^ their little ones, that is to say, after the desires
the^ have to perfect themselves, and never find persons sufficient to speak
unto, and to demand of them proper and new means therefore: in breife they
study so much to speak of the perfection they pretend to get, that they
forgett the principal means for the practice thereof; which is that same of
keeping themselves quiett, and putting all their confidence in him, who only
can give the increase to that they have sown and planted.

. All our good depends of the grace of God in whom we ought to place all our
confidence: and nevertheless it seems, by the egernesse that they have to
do much, they place their confidence in their labors, and in the
multiplicitye of exercises that they embrace, and in seems to them they are
never able to do enough. This is good, provided that it weere accompaned with
peace, and with a loving care of doing well all that they do, notwithstanding
allwaies depending upon the grace of God, and not on their exercises: I would
say, not to expect any fruit of their labor, without the grace of God: it
appears that these souls forcing themselves in the inquiry of their
perfection, have forgotten, or else they know not, that which S. Hierom
says: O poor man what do thou confiding in thy labor, and in thy
industrye? know thou not, that it apperta neth ^o thee to cultiuate the
earth, to plovve and to sovve it: but it is the part of God to give the growth
to the pla^tes, and to cause thee to have a good harvest, and to rain
favorably upon thy sowed grounds? thou may water them, and it is wel^ done;
but yet for all that, it would serve thee for nothing, if God did not bless
thy labor, and give thee of his pure grace and goodness, a good harvest, and
not by thy sweates: Depend then entirely of his divine Bounty. It is true, it
is our duty to cultiuate well, but it is God that causes our trauaill to be
followed with good success: the Holy Church sings in every feast of the
holy Confessors, God has honored your labors, in causing you to dravve
fruit of them, to show that we of our selves are not able to do any thing,
with out thee grace of God, in which we ought to place all our confidence, not
expecting any thing of our selves. I pray you let us not be too sollicitous
in our business, for, for to do it well, we must apply our selves carefully:
but quietly and peaceably, not putting confidence in our endeavors, but in God
and in his grace. These anxieties of spirit, that we have to advance our
perfection; and to see if we be advanced, are nothing pleasing to God, and
serve for no other thing then to satisfy self love; who is a great hurrier
up and down, trotting hither and thither, and never cease to undertake very
much, although it do but little: one good work well done with tranquillity
of spirit, is vvorth much more, then many better works perfomed with over
much egernesse.

. The Dove museth simply of the work she has in hand to do it well,
leaving all other care to her dear companion: the soul truly colombine, that
is to say, which loves God dearly, applies her self simply to all, and
with out impetuositye takes the means, which are prescribed to perfect her
self, not searching after others how perfect soever they may be: my
well-beloved, says she, thinks of me, and I confide in him, he loves me,
and in testimony of my love I am wholy his. A while since there weere some
holy Religious women that said to me; My Lord, what shall we do this
year, the year past we did fast three days in the week, and took as many
disciplines; what shall we now do this year? it is necessary we should do
some thing more, as well to give thanks to God for the yoare past, as to
proceed all ways forward in the way of God: It is very well said, that we
ought to advance our selves daily, answered I: but our advancement is not
effected as you conceive, by the multitude of exercises of piety, but by the
perfection wherevvith we do them, confiding always more in our Dear
beloved Dove, and more distrusting our selves: The passed year you fasted
three days in the week, and took discipline three times; if you will
always double your exercises, this year you must fast and discipline the
vveke entire: but the year that is to come what will you do? you must make
nine days in the week, or else fast twice in the day: what a great follye is
it of those that busy their heads in desiring to be martyred in the Indies,
and never apply themselves to that which they have to do, according to their
condition: it is also a great deceat in them that will eat more then they can
digest, we have not spiritual heat sufficient to digest well all that we
embrace for our perfection, and yet we will not cut of these anxieties of
spirit, that we have of desiring to do much more, to read many spiritual
books, espetiallie when they are new, to speak well of God, and of all the
most spiritual things, to incite us, say we, to devotion, to hear sermons,
to make conferences upon every occasion, to communicate very often, and
confess often, to serve the sick, to speak well of all that passes in us
for to manifest the pretension that we have ^o perfect our selves, and the
soonest that possible may be, and such like; are not these things very proper
to make us perfect, and to attain to the end of our designs? yeas doubtless,
provided that all this be done according as it is ordained, and that it be
always with d^pendance of the grace of God that is to say, that we put not
our confidence in all this, how good soever it be: but in one only God, who
only can make us to gather fruit of all our exercises.

. But, my dear daughters, I beseech you consider a little the lives of the
great Religious saint S. Antonye who has been honored of God and men,
because of his extraordinary sanctity; tell me how did he attain to so
great sanctitye and perfection? was it by the force of reading, or by
conferences, and frequent communions, or by the multitude of sermons, that he
heard? not so: but he attained there unto, in serving himself with the example
of the holy hermitts, learning of one abstinence, of another prayer, even so he
went as a careful Be, picking and gathering the virtues of the servants of
God, to compose of them the honey of holy edification. How did S. Paul the
first hermitt attain unto perfection, did he gain it by good books? he had
none: was it confessions or communions that he used? he never made but two in
his life: was it conferences or preaching? he had them not; for he did never
see any man with in the deserte but S. Antonye, who came to visitt him in the
end of his life, do you know what made him a Saint? it was the fidelitye
wherewith he had employed himself to that which he enterprised in the
beginning, to the which he had been called, an^ intertayned not any other
cogitations. Those Hol^ Religious who did live under the charge of S.
Pachomius, had they books or preachings? none conferences they had, but
rarely: did they confess^ often? Sometimes upon good feasts: did they hear^
many Masses? the sundays and the feasts, on other days none: but what will be
said the^? that eattin^ so seldom of the spiritual foodes, that nourish ou^
souls to immortallitye they weere allwaies in s^ good state, that is to say,
so strong and courageous, ^or to undertake the gayning of virtues, and to
attain to perfection, and to the end of their pretention: and we who eat
much more; are allwaies so lean, that is to say so remiss and languishing in
^he poursuite of our enterprises: and it seems that we have not, longer then
spiritual consolations march before us, any courage, or vigor in the service
of our Lord? we must then imitate these holy Religious, applying our selves to
our affairs, that ^s to say, to that which God requires of us, according to
our vocation, fervently, and humbly, not to think of any other thing then
this: nor expecting to find any means fitter to perfect us then it.

. Put it may be you will reply, Sir, you say feruentlye, Good God! and how
shall I do this? for I have not any fervor: no, not of that, which ^ou
understand, to wit not the feeling of fervor which God gives to whom he
thinks good, and ^t is not in our power to gain it when we please: ^ add
also humbly, to the end none have any subject of excuse: for do not say, I
have not humility, ^t is not in my power to have it; for the Holy Ghost that
is bounty it self, does give it him that demau^deth it of him: not that
humility (that is to say) that feeling of our littleness, which makes us so
much to humble our selves so graciously: But I mean the humility that makes
us know our own abiection, and which causes us to love it having
acknowledged it to be in us; for that is true ^umilitie. Me^ did never study
so much as now they do. Those great Saints S. Augustine, S. Gregory, S.
Hilarie, whose solemnity we keep this day, and many others, have not studied
so much, they had not time to do it, composing so many books as ^hey have
done, preaching, and performing all other things appertayning, to their
charges. But they had so great confidence in God, and in his grace and so great
distrust in themselves, that they atte^ded not to themselves, nor co^fided any
thing at all in their own industry, nor in their labor, so that all the great
works that they have done, weere done purelie by the confidence which they had
in the grace of God and in his Allmighty power: It is thou, O Lord said they,
which makeest us to labor, and for thee we labor; it shall be thou alone which
must bless our sweats and pains, and give us a good harvest: and so their
books and their preachings did bring forth marvelous fruits; and we who
co^fide in our fair words, in our exquisite fine speeches, and in ou^
doctrine; all our pains vanish as smoke, and yeal^ no other fruit the^
vanity. You must the^ for conclusion of this first law that I give you fully
co^fide i^ God, and do all for him, entirely quitting the care o^ your selves
to your dear master Dove; who will exercise an exceeding care and foresight
over you: an^ how much more true and perfect your confidenc^ shall be, so more
peculier shall his providence be^ over you.

. 3. I thought good to give you for the second law^ the word which the doves
speak in their language* The more they take, the more I make, say they; wha^
means that? the meaning is this when their little pigeons are grown a
little great, the master of the doue-cote comes and takes them from them,
an^ presently they put themselves to sit for others; but i^ they did not take
them, they would provide for the longer, and consequently, they would breed
less they say; The more they take from me; the more make: And to make you
understand the better wha^ I would say, I vvil present an example unto you:
Io^ that great servant of God, praised by the mouth o^ God himself: did not
permit himself to be overcome by any affliction, which did come upon him
the more that God did take from him his young p^geons: the more did he begett:
what is that which he did not do, whiles he was in his first prosperity? what
good whorkes did he omit? he speaks of himself in this manner: I was a
foot to the lame, that is to say, I caused him to be carried, or I set him on
my ass, or camel; I was an eye to the blind, in causing him to be guided; I
was in fine the prouider for the hungrye, and the refuge of all the afflicted;
Now consider him in extreme pouertye: He complayneth not that God had taken
from him the means that he had to do so many good works: but he says with
the dove, The more is taken from me, the more I do: not Alms deeds; for he
had not wherewithal; but in this only act of submission, and patience that he
made, seeing himself deprived of all his goods, and of all his children, he
did more then ever he had done by all the great works of charity that he
had wrought, during the time of his prosperity, and yealded himself more
pleasing to God, in this only act of patience, then ever he had done in so
very many good works, that he had performed in his whole life: for of
necessity he must have a love more noble and generous for this only act, the^
ever was needful for all the others put together. We must then likewise do
the same to observe this amiable law of Doves; giving our selves over to be
deprived by our souetayne master of our little young pigeo^s: that is to say,
of the means to execute our defices, when it pleases him to deprive us of
the^, how good soever they be, never complaining of him nor lamenting as if he
did us great wrong: but rather we ought to double not our desires, nor our
exercises, but the perfection with the which we do the^, endeavoring by this
means to gain more, by one only act (as undoubtedly we shall do) then we
should have done with a hundred other acts done according to our propension and
affection: our Lord will not have (...) carrye his cross, but only by one
end, and he vvil be honored therein, as great ladies who cause their traynes
to be carried after them; his will i^ notwithstanding that we should carrye
the cross, that he lays upon our shoulders, which indeed i^ our own. But
alas! we do nothing; for when hi^ Goodness depriueth us of the consolation
which he was wont to give us in our exercises, it seemet^ that all is lost,
and the means to perform ou^ begun enterprise is taken from us. Consider this
soul how well she sits on her eggs in the tim^ of consolation, and
leaves the care of her self to her only well-beloved one. If she be in
prayer, what holy desires does she not make to please him* how tenderly
affected is she in his presence? vvholye melting into her well-beloved, she
puts her self entirely into the arms of his Divine Providence: O these are
most amiable eggs, and all this is very^ good, besides, the little pigions are
not vvanting which are the effects: for what is it that she does not? the
works of her charity are in so great number, her modesty appears before
all the sisters she gives exceeding edifi^ation, she causes admiration in all
those that behold her, or who knov^ her; mortifications, says she, lost me
nothing a^ that time; they vveere rather consolations to mee^ and for
Obediences they vveere my joys: I no^ soouer heard the first sound of the
Bell, but I vv^^ risen: I did not permit one point of virtue (...) pass
without practice, and I did do all this vvit^ most great peace and
tranquillity. But now that ^ am in disgust, and in driesse in prayer, I have
not an^ courage as it seems to me, for my amendmen^ I have not the fervor I
used to have in my exercises; in fine, the cold and frost has wholly benumbed
me; I believe it well. Consider I pray yo^ (...) this poor soul, how she
lamenteth her disgrace, her discontent does appear even in her face, she has
her countenance on the ground, dejected and melencholye, she walks all
pensive and so co^fused as nothing more. Good God! what have you sister, (are
we constrained to say to her.) O! what have I: I am so decayed in vigor
nothing can content me, all is disgustfull to me, I am now so confused: But
what confusion is it? For there ar^ two sor^s, one which co^ducteth to
humility, and to life, and the other to despair, and consequentlye to death,
I assure you (quoth she) I am so near it, that I have almost lost the courage
to pass further in my undertaken course of perfection. O Good God! what a
weakness is this? consolation is vvanting, and by that occation, courage is
lost. O we must not do so; but rather the more God depriueth us of
consolation the more we ought to labor, and confide in him, to give him
testimony of our fidelitye: one only act made with dryness of spirit, is
more worth then many made with great tenderness. Because, that, as I have
allreadye said, speaking of Job: it is wrought with a more strong love,
allthough not so tender, nor so pleasing: so that the more they take from me
the more I make; is the second law, that I desire very much that you observe.

. 4. The third law that I present to you of the Doves, is this, that they
weep as if they did rejoice, they sing allwaies one self same tune, asvvell
for their songs of rejoicing, as for those of ^amenting; that is to say, to
bemoane themselves, and manifest their grief. Behold them pearched on their
branches, where they bewail the loss that they have had of their little
ones, which the vveasill or ovvle has robbed them of (for when any other
takes them, then the master of the Douehouse, they are very much afflicted)
consider them also when their companion comes and approaches to the so that
they are wholly comforted, they chang not their tune, but make the same
mournful grumling sound, to express their contentment, a^ they did to manifest
their grief. This is that mo^^ holy Equallitie of spirit, my Dear souls,
that vvish unto you, I do not say, equallitie of humors, nor of
inclinations, I say equallitie o^ spirit: for I make none, neither do I
desire tha^ you should make any acount of the turmoyle, tha^ the inferior part
of your soul causes to troubl^ you, which is that which causes unquietness
(wh^ the Superior part does not her duty, in making h^^selfe master, nor
does keep good watch, to discover her enemies, as the Spiritual Conflict
says we ought to do; to the end she be pro^ptly advertise of the turbulent
motions, and assaults, that the inferior part raises, which proceed from our
sence^ and from our inclinations and passions, for to mak^ war against it and
to subject it to her laws) but say we must retain our selves always
constan^ and resolute in the Superior part of our soul, t^ prosecute the
virtue whereof we make profe^sion, and to keep our selves in a continual
equa^litie, asvvell in adverse things as in prosperous, i^ desolarion, as in
consolation, and in fine as well i^ the thickest of aridities, as in the midst
of cher^shings. Job, of whom we spoke in the second law furnishes us
moreover with an example of this su^iect: for he did ever sing the self same
air in all the songs that he has composed, which are no other t^^ the
history of his life* what is that which he did say^ when as God did make his
goods to be multiplye^ giving him children, and in fine he did send hi^
whatsoever his desire could wish in this life? vvh^ said he, but, the name of
God be blessed? this w^ his song of love, that he did sing in all occasions:
f^^ consider him reduced to the extremity of affliction, that does he do,
he sings his canticle of lame^^^tio^ upon the same air that he did sing
the other ^or reioyceing; we have received says he good things of our Lord,
wherefore should not we re^eaue the evil? Our Lord has given me children,
and goods, and our Lord has taken them from me, ^is holy name be blessed:
allwaies the name of God ^e blessed. O this holy soul was a chaste and loving
^oung dove, exceedinglye cherished of her dear and only one; even so should
we do My dear ^hildren, that is, in all occasions we should take the ^ood
and the evil, our comforts and afflictions from ^he hand of our Lord, never
ceasing to sing other ^hen that most excellent canticle: The name of God ^e
blessed, allwaies on the air of continual equal^itye: for if this good happ
arrive unto us we shall ^iue in great peace in all occurrences. But do not ^ou
do, as those that weep when consolation ^ayleth, and do no other thing but
sing when it is ^eturned or comes again: vvherin they are like ^o the Apes
and Baboones, who are always sadd and furious, when the air becomes
raynie and ^loudie; and never cease to leap and skipp, and ^urne heels over
head, when it is fair vvea^her.

. 5. Consider then the three laws that I give ^ou, the which nevertheless are
laws totallye of ^oue, obliging no otherwise then for love. Let ^oue then
carrye us unto our Lord, that we be sollicitous to observe and keep them, to
the end we may truly say, in imitation of the beautiful Dove of the
Sovereign spirit, which is the sacred spouse: My well-beloved is all mine, and
I am all for him, doing no other thing then for to please him: he has his
heart always toward me by providence, as I have mine toward him by
confidence: and having all this time of our li^ exhibited our selves for our
well-beloved, he vv^ have care to provide for us his eternal Glory, (...)
recompense of our confidence: and there we she see the happy estate, of
those, who quitting all supe^fluous and vnquiett care that we have ordinaril^
over our selves, and of our perfection, giving themselves simply and entirely to
their duty, aba^doni^ themselves with out reservation into the hands the
divine goodness, for whom only they ha^ labored; how their labors shallbe
in the (...) follovved with such peace and repose, as cannot ^ explicated: for
they shall rest for ever within (...) breast of their vvellbeloued; The happy
lot also ^ those who shall have observed the second lav^ will be very great;
for permitting and giving themselves over to be deprived of their young pigeo^
by their master which is our Lord, with out tro^ble or discontent, having had
the courage to sa^ The more they take from me, the more I ma^^ remaining
submisse unto him who has spoyl^ them, these shall sing, so much the more
cour^giously in the height of heaven, this Most me^fluous canticle, God be
Blessed, in the mid^^ of eternal consolations, as they have song w^^ a better
courage in the thickest of the desolation^ anguishes, and disgusts of this
mortal and tran^torie life, during the which we ought to endeuo^ carefully to
conserve this most amiable indif^rencye of spirit. Amen.

THE EIGHT ENTERTAYNMENT.
OF DISAPPROPRIATION, AND deprivation of all things.
THese little affections of, mine and thine, are the relics of the world,
where there is nothing so precious as they: for it is the sovereign ^^licitye
of the world, to have great store of things ^oper, and of which one may say,
This is mine: ^ow that which makes us be come affectionat to ^^at which is
ours, is the great esteem we have ^f our selves: for we hold our selves for
such ex^^llent creatures, that we esteem any one thing ^at appertains to us
above measure: and the ^ttle esteem that we have of others, causes that ^ee
have a dislike of that which has served them: ^^t if we weere truly humble,
and unclothed of ^ur selves, so that we held our selves for nothing before
God: we would make no reckoning of ^^at should be proper for us, and we should
estee^e our selves exceedingly honored to be served ^ith that which has been
for the use of another. ^ut we ought as well in this, as in every other thing,
(...) make a difference, between inclinations, and ^^fections; for when these
things are no other then ^^clinations, and not affections, we must not ^ouble
our selves, because, it does not depend of ^s, to be free from having evil
inclinations, as it ^oth, from bad affections. So then, if it happen that ^
changing the garment of any sister, to give her another of less worth, the
inferior part be moved a little, it is not sin, if that with reason she
acce^^ it willinglye for the love of God, and so likevv^^ of all other motions
that arrive unto us.

. 2. Now these motions do happen, because w^ have not put all our will in
common, which is a thi^ that oug^t to be done entering into Religion: (...)
every Sister should leave ^er proper will witho^ the gate, to the end, she have
no other will then (...) will of God: happy is she that shall have no oth^
will then that of the community, and who she every day take out of the
common purse that whi^ shall be necessary for her, even so ought this ^cred
word of our Lord to be understood: Be (...) careful for to morrow: it
regards not so m^^ that which appertains to corporal food or cl^thing as
spiritual exercises: for if one should ^maund of you, what will you do to
morrow? y^ would answer I know not, this day I vvil (...) such a thing that
is commanded me, to morro^ do not know what I shall do, because I kno^ not
what they will co^mmaund me: whosoever (...) do this, she shall never be
vexed nor unquiet, ^ where true indiffere^cye is, there cannot be displ^sure or
sadness. If there be any that will have M^ and Thine, let her go seek it out
of the house; (...) within it is not to be spoken of.

. 3. Now we must not only will in gene^^ disappropriatio^, but in
particular: for there is noth^ more easy the to say in gross, we must
renou^^ our selves, and quitt our own will: but when must come to practice,
there lies the difficulty; (...) this cause we must make considerations upon
(...) condition, and upon all things that depend ther^ in particular, then in
particular, to renounce for^ with one of our proper wills, and inco^tinently
a^^ther, until such time as we be entirely vncloth^^ of them all, This true
nakedness of all things wrought by three degrees. The first in the affection
^ereof, the which is begotten in us, by the consi^^ration of the beauty of
this nakedness. The second ^gree is, the resolution that follows the
affection, ^r we easilye resolve of a good that we affect. ^he third is the
practice, which is the most difficult. ^he goods whereof we must unclothe our
selves, ^e of three sorts. Exterior goods, the goods of ^e body, and the
goods of the soul. Exterior ^ods are all those things, that we have left out
of ^eligio^: as housses, possessions, parents, friends and ^e like. For to
unclothe us of them, we must re^^unce them into the hands of our Lord, and
then ^^maund those affections that he would we should ^^ue for them: for we
must not remain with out ^^fections, nor have them all equal and indifferent;
^ee must love every one in his degree Charity gi^eth place and order to the
affections. The second ^ods are those of the body, beautye, health and the ^e
like things which we must renounce, and the^ ^e must not go to a looking
glass, to behold if ^e be fair, nor care more for health the^ for sickness, ^
least touching the superior part; for nature will ^lwaies have a sensible
apprehension, and exclame ^^mtimes, espetiallie when the person is not very
^erfect. We ought therefore to remain equally ^ontent, in sickness and in
health, and to take the ^emedies, and such sustenance as we find, I mean
^ith reason allwaies; for touching inclinations, I ^^tt them pass. The goods
of the heart are the con^^lations, and svvetnesses that are found in a
spiri^^all lif^: and these goods are very good, and where^ore (will you say to
me) must we then vn^oth our selves of them? it must be done notvvith^anding,
and they are to be remitted into the hands ^f our Lord, for to dispose thereof
as it shall please ^im, and we are to serve him, asvvell without them as with
them. There is another sort of goo^ which are neither interior nor exterior,
that a^ neither goods of the body, nor goods of the ha^ these are imaginarye
goods, that depend upon (...) opinion of another, they are called honor,
esteem^ reputation: Now we must unclothe our selves* them wholye in an
instant, and not will any oth^ honor, then the honor of the congregation,
wh^^ is in all things to seek the Glory of God; (...) other esteem or
reputation, then that of the co^munitye, which is to give good edification in
^ occasions.

. 4. The stripping of our selves of all these ^ fore said things, ought not to
be done out of contempt, but by abnegation, for the only and p^ love of God.
We must note here, that the co^tentment that we find, in meeting with
person that we love, and the testimonies of affection the we render them, in
behoulding them, are ^^ contrary to this virtue of deprivation, so that it
(...) not inordinate, and the persons being absent o^ heart run not after
them: for how shall we b^ able (the object being present) to cause the pow^
not to be moved? it is as if one should say t^ person at the encounter of a
lion or a bear, be ^^ affeard; this is not in our power. Likewise at (...)
encounter of those we love, it cannot be but the we shall be moved with Joy
and contentmen^ wherefore this is not contrary to virtue. I say y^ more, that
if I have a desire to see any one for so^^ profitable thing, and that would
redound to t^^ Glory of God, if his design to come happen (...) be crossed,
and that I feel some sorrovve, yea al^ that I somewhat force my self, to
divert the occ^sions that retain him, I do nothing in this contrary to the
virtue of disappropriation, so that pass not into unquietness. Here you see
the virtue is not so terrible a thing as some imagine ^ be; this is a fault
that many make, they frame ^ish imaginations in their spiritts, and think that
^way to heaven is stra^gly difficult, wherein they ^tly abuse and deceive
themselves, for David ^th to our Lord, that his law was very sweet, ^
according, as the wicked did diuulge it to be ^^e, and difficult, this good
king said it was ^^e sweet then honey. We ought to say the same ^ur
vocation, esteeming it not only good and ^e, but also sweet and amiable. If
we do so, ^ shall have a great love to observe all that which ^endeth
there-on.

^. 5. It is true, my dear Sisters, that we shall ^er know how to attain
to perfection, vvhiles ^ we have affection to any imperfection, how ^e
soever it be; yea also when it shall be no more ^n to have an unprofitable
thought, and you ^^uld not believe how much evil this brings the soul; for
after you have given your spirit ^ertye, to settle it self to think of an
unprofitable ^ng, it will afterward think of pernicious ^ngs: we must then
cut of the evil, so soon as ^e perceive it, how little soever it be: we
must (...) examine in good earnest, if it be true, as som^es it seems to us,
that we have not our affe^ons engaged: for example; if when you are pray^,
you begin to speak foam words which may ^rease the praise, that they give
you, or otherwise ^hen you seek it by artificial words, saying that ^u have
not so good a memory, or so good a ^ritt as you weere wont to have to
discourse ^ell: Alas! who perceaueth not that you pretend, ^ey should tell
you, that allwaies you speak excee^ngly well? search then well into the
depth of ^ur conscience, if you find therein the affection to ^nitie. You may
easily also know, if you be tied to any thing, when you have not comm^tie
to perform what you have purposed: f^^ you have no affection thereunto, you
will re^ as much contentment not to have done it, as if had effected it: and
contrary-wise if you be t^bled, it is a sign, that you have settled your
affec^ there-on. Now our affections are so precious (...) they ought all to be
employed in the love of G^ that we must take very great heed not to l^^ them
in unprofitable things, and a fault, how ^^soeuer it may be, committed with
affection, is (...) contrary to perfection then a hundred others (...) by
surprise and without affection.

. 6. You demand how you ought to love cre^res; I tell you breiflie, that
there are certain lo^ that exteriourly seem great and perfect in the^ of
creatures, which before God will be found (...) and of no vvorth: because
that these freindships not grounded in true charity, which is God* be^
certain alliances, and inclinatio^s, and upon so^ consideratio^s humaynlie
worthy of praise and a^ptation: in the contrary there are others that
e^riourlye seem little, empty and nothing in the^ of the world; which before
God are found to be^ fraught and very excellent, because they are m^ only in
God, and for God without mixture of (...) proper interest Now the acts of
charity that done about those whom we love in this sort, (...) a thousand
times more perfect, for so much as t^ all tend purely to God: But the services
and ot^^^ assistance that we give to those whom we l^ by inclination, are
far less vvorth in meritt, because of the great contentment and sattisfactio^
t^ we receive in doing them, and that (ordinaril^ we do them more for that
motive then for (...) love of God. There is furthermore another reason which
makes these first freindships whereof v^speake, less then the second; to
wit that they are of continuance, because the ground-vvorke ^g frail,
as soon as there happens any cross (...) wax could, or chang themselves, the
vvhicb ^eth not to those who are settled and groun^n God, for that the cause
is solid and perma^.

^. To this purpose S. Catherine of Sienne made ^od comparison: If you take,
said she, a glass, fill it within a fountain, and drink in that ^e not
taking it out of the fountain, although drink as much as you will, the
glass will not ^mptie; but if you take it forth of the fountain, (...) you
have dronke, the glass will be empty: eue^ ^is in freindships, when they are
drawn from (...) spring or fountain they never wither nor ^^h. The
kindnesses and signs of frindships the^^^s which we show contrary to our
own in^^^tio^ to the person to whom we have an auer^^ are better, and more
pleasing to God, the^ those we do dravve with se^sitiue affection and this ^t
not to be called doubleness or dissimulatio^, ^lthough I have a contrary
feeling, it is but in the ^^^iour part, and the acts I do, is with the force
^^ason, which is the principal part of my soul. ^^ch manner, that when those
to vvho^ I do these ^tesyes, should know, that I do them, be^cause ^^^e an
auersio^ from them; they ought not to be ^nded at it: but rather to esteem of
them more (...) if they wear imparted of sensible affection: ^uersions are
natural, and of themselves they not wicked, when as we do not follovv
(...): contrarievvise, it is a means to practice a ^sand sorts of virtues:
and our Lord himself more liking to us, when with extreme repugna^^e^ go to
kiss his feet, the^ if we went to do ^ith much more sweetness and content.
Also those that have nothing that is comelye and gracious very happy: For they
are assured the love we (...) them is excellent, since it is all for God, and
in* We think often that we love some person God, and we love them for our
selves, seruin^ selves of this pretext, saying: that it is for this that we
love them, but in verity we love (...) for the comfort we find in them:
for is it^ thing more svveete, to see a soul come to y^^ of good affection,
that follovveth exceedingly* your counsels, and who goes faithfully and
^ceably on the way which you have directed yes without all doubt, the^ to see
another all ^ vnquiett, perplexed, and weak to follovv^ and to whom one
thing must be told a (...) sa^d times, which you therefore neglect, perch^ it
is not for God then that you love the for For this last person is also as dear
to God (...) first, and moreover you should love her (...) because there is
much more to be labored for* It is true that there where there is more o^
that is to say more virtue, which is a partici^ of the divine quallities, we
owe more affe^ as for example, if there be found more p^ souls then that of
your Superior, we ou^ love them more for that reason: notvvithsta^ we owe
much more love to our super^ because they are our fathers and directours.

. 8. Touching that which you demau^ me, If we must be glad that a sister pr^
virtue to the cost of another; I say that we (...) to love the good in our
neighbor as in our s^ and principally in Religion, where all ought perfectly
in common, neither ought we (...) sorry, that a sister practice some virtue
to my (...) as for example, I find my self with one more (...) the^ I at the
gate, and I withdraw my self (...) ^^waye: according to the measure that I
practice ^act of humility, she ought with sweetness to ^ctice simplicity,
and to prove at another encou^^o prevent it. Likewise if I give her a stool,
or ^re from any place to give it her, she should be ^tent that I make this
little gain, and by that ^nes she shall be partaker of it: as if she did say, ^e
I could not do this act of virtue, I am very (...) that this sister has done
it, and we must not ^ly not be sorry, but also ought to contribute that we
are able for this, even unto our skin, if ^eere needful: for so as God be
Glorified we ^uld not care by whom: in such sort, that if an ^asion should
be presented to perform some ^rke of virtue, and our Lord did demand of us
^o we should like best, to perform it, we ^st aunsvvere him, Lord she who
shall be able to (...) it most to thy Glory. Now not having this ^ise, we ought
to desire to do itt; for charity ^ins first with it self: but if I cannot, I
ought to ^oyce, delight, and be exceeding glade that ano^r has done it, and
so we shall perfectly put all ^gs in common. Further I must say the same for
(...) which concerns the temporal* so that the ^se be accommodated, we
ought not to care, ^ether it be by our means, or by another. If ^e be found
these little contrary affections, it is ^gne that there is yet, thine and mine
amongst (...)

^. 9. In fine, you demand, if we may know we do advance in perfection,
or no. I aunsvvere, ^e shall never be able to know our own per^ion: for it
happens to us, as to those that sail ^on sea, they do not know whether
they go ^vvard or no: But the master Pilot, who kno^^th the air where they
sail, knovveth it; even so (...) cannot judge of our advancement, but easilye
of another, for when we do a good action, (...) dare not assure our selves
that we have perfor^ it with perfection, for so much as humility (...) forbid
us. Now allthoug we may judge of the v^^tues of another, yet must we not
therefore at (...) time determine, that one person is better then a^^ther:
because apparences are very deceaitfull; (...) such as exteriourlye seem to
be very vertuou^ the eyes of creatures, before the eyes of God man less then
another who appears much more i^ perfect above all perfection. I vvish you
humili^^ which is not only charitable, but svveet and ^ctable. For Charity
is Humility asce^ding, and ^^militye is Charity discending; I love you be^
with more humilitye, and fewer other perfecti^^ then with many other
perfections and less hu^^litie.

THE NINTH ENTERTAINMENT.
WHEREIN IS TREATED OF MODEST of the manner to receive corrections; an^ the
means for a soul, so to establish her es^ in God, that nothing may be able
to vvi^^dravve her from him.
. 1. YOu demand what true Modesty is: I (...) tell you, There are four
virtues, (...) bear the name of modesty; the first is that vvh^^ bears it
by eminencye above the others, this is comeliness of our beauiour and
exterior gest^ There are two vices opposite to this virtue, to (...)
dissolutnes in our countena^ces and gestures: the to say, lightness; the other
vice which is no (...) contrary is an affected countenance. The second that
bears the name of modesty, is the interior ^omlinesse of our understanding,
and will: this likewise has two vices opposite, which are curiositye ^n the
understanding, multiplicitye of desires to ^novve and understand all things;
and instabilitie ^n our enterprises passing from one exercise to another, not
settling our selves upon any one: The ^ther vice is a certain stupiditye and
carelesnes of ^piritt, that will not know nor learn things ne^essarie for
our perfection: an imperfection which is ^o less dangerous the^ there other.
The third kind of Modesty, consists in our conversation, and in our words,
that is to say, in our manner of speaking, and conuersing with our neighbor,
avoiding the ^wo imperfections that are opposite unto it, to wit ^lownishnes,
and over much babbling where of the ^ne hinders us from contributing any
thing, to the ^ntertaynment of honest conversation; the other makes us so to
speak that we take the time from others, that they cannot speak in their
turn. The ^ourth is honesty and decency in garments, and ^he contrary vices
are uncleanness, and super^uitie.

Behold here fowr sorts of Modesty, the first ^s exceeding much to be
commended, for many ^easons: and first because it does subject us very much:
neither is there any virtue, in the which so ^articular attention is
requisite; and in that it subiecteth us, consists the great valor thereof;
for all that subiecteth us for God, is of great meritt, and meruelouslye
pleasing to God. The second reason ^s, that it does not only subject us for a
time: but ^llvvaies, and in every place, asvvell being alone, ^s in company,
and at all times, yea sleeping. A great Saint vvrote to a disciple of his,
saying; that in the presence of God, he ought to lay himself down modestlye
in his bed, even as he would do if ou^ Lord JESUS being yet alive should
command him to sleep and lie down in his presence; and although (says
he) thou see him not, nor understand not the commandment he gives
thee* he omitteth not to do it, even as if thou did see him because that in
effect he is present with thee, and keeps thee whilst thou sleep.

O good God, how modestly and deuoutlye should we lay our selves to rest if
we did see thee? without doubt we should cross our arme^ with great
devotion upon our breasts. Modesty then does allwaies subject us, and in all
occasion^ of our life, because the Angels are always present* yea God
himself, before whose eyes we ough^ to govern our selves modestlye. This
virtue is also very recommendable, because of the edificatio^ of our
neighbor, and I assure you that simple modestye in the exterior has
converted many, as i^ happened to S. Francis, who passed one time through a
town, with so great modesty in his behavior, that without giving one
word, a great number o^ young poeple follovved him (drawn only by this
example) to be instructed of him. Modesty is a dumme exhortation, it is a
virtue that S. Paul recommendeth very particularly to the Philippians the 4th
Chap. saying: Let your modesty appeare^ before all men: and this is that he
says to hi^ disciple S. Timothy a Bishope should be adorne^ with, tovvit
with Modesty, and not with ric^ garments: to the end that by his modest and
mild^ demeanor he give confidence to every one to approach to him, equally
avoiding inciuility, and lightness, to the end that giving freedom to the
vvorldly poeple to resorre to him, they may not conceive that he is worldly as
they be.

2, The virtue of modesty, observes thre^ things, to wit, time, place, and
person; for tell me, should not she be troublesome, that would frovvne and
pout in the time of recreation, and not be merry with the company? there
are gestures and countenances, that would be immodest out of that time which
are not so then: likewise she that should laugh when they are in the midst of
serious affairs; and should give freedom to her spirit, as we reasonably
do in recreation, should she not be esteemed light and immodest? we ought
also to observe the place, the persons, the co^uersations, with whom we
are; but very partiticularly the quallitie of the person. The modesty of a
woman in the world is otherwise then that of a Religious woman; a virgin in
the world should not be esteemed, if she would look dovvnevvarde, as our
sisters do, no more then our sisters should be if they held not there sight
more low then the maidens of the world do: that which is modesty in one
man, will be immodestie in another man, because of his quallitie: gravity
becomes an aged person exceedingly well, which would be affected in a
young person, to whom is convenient a more respective and humble modesty. I
must not omit to tell you a thing that I read a fevv days past, because it
regards the discourse that we make of modestye. The great Saint Arsenius
(who was chosen by the Pope, S. Damasus to instruct and bring up the son of
the Emperor Theodosius Arcadius, who was to succeed him in the Empire)
after that he had been honored many years in the court, and favored of the
Emperor, as much as any man in the world, in the end being vvearie of all
these vanities (although he had lived no less christianly then honorably in
the court) resolved with himself to retire into the deserte, with the holy
Fathers the Hermitts, who did live there; the which design he did very
courageously execute. The Fathers, who had heard the renoune of the virtues of
this great Saint, were very glad, and much comforted to have him in their
company. He grevve particulerly familiar with two Religious, the name of one
of them was Pastor, and he had great freindshipe with them: on a day when all
the Fathers weere assembled, to make spiritual conference (for it has been
the custom in all former times, so to do amongst pious persons) one of the
Fathers advertised the superior, that Arsenius did ordinarily use an immodest
manner in that he did cross one leg over the other: it is true, said the
Father; I have very often noted it. But he is a good man who has lived a long
time in the world; and has brought this gesture from the court, how could he
do otherwise? excusing him; for he was troubled to reprehe^d him for so small
a matter, wherein there was not any sin: yet he had a desire to have him
corrected therefore, for he had no other thing then that, wherein they might
find what to say against him. The^ the Religious Pastor said: Father do not
trouble your self, it will be no great matter to tell it him, he will be very
gladd, therefore, if you please to morrow at the hour of the asse^bly, I will
set my self in the same posture that he does, and let me receive
correction before all for it, and so he will understand that he must not do
it. The Father then correcting Pastor, the good Arsenius cast himself, at the
feet of the Father, humbly demanding pardon, saying; that although they had
not marked it, he had nevertheless always committed this fault, which was
his ordinary behavior in the court; then he asked penance for it; but it
was not given him, and never after did they see him in this posture. In this
history I find many things very worthy of consideration; first the prudence
of the Superior, not to trouble the good Arsenius by correction, for a matter
of so small importance; nevertheless seeking the means to correct it,
wherein he showed very vvel^, that they were all most exact in the least
thing that appertayned to Modesty. More-ouer I note the noble uprightness of
Arsenius, to yeald himself faulty, and his fidelitye in correcting himself,
although this was so light a thing, that in it self was not immodest being
in the court, although being among the Fathers it was so. I mark also, that
we ought not to be astonished at our selves, if we have as yet some old
habitt of the world, since Arsenius had this having remained a long time, in
the company of the Fathers in the desert we cannot be so soon ridd of all
our imperfect ons, and we must never be astonished to s^e many in our
selves, so that we have the will to vvithstand them. Furthermore I note,
that it is not to be thought an evil judgment, that the superior imposes
correction to another, for some fault that you commit asvvell as he, to the
end, that without reprehending of you, you of your self ^mend it: but you
must humble your self profoundly, seeing that the superior takes notice of
your weakness, and knovveth very well, you would have much feeling of the
correction, if it were done to you. We must also dearly love this
^biection, and humble our selves as Arsenius did, confessing that we be
culpable of the same fault, provided that we humble our sel^es always in
the spirit of sweetness and tranquillity.

. 3. I perceive very well, that you desire ^ should furthermore speak of the
other ver^ues of Modestye: I tell you then, that the second, which is the
interior, works the same effects in the soul, that this which we have
spoken of does in the body; this composeth the motions, gestures, and
countenances of the body, avoiding the two extremities, which are these two
contrary vices, lightness or dissolution, and a countenance too much affected.
Likewise interior modesty mayntaineth the powers of the soul in
tranquillity, and Modesty, avoiding as I have said curiosity of the
understanding, over the which she principally exercises her care, also
cutting of from the will her multitude of desires, making it to apply it self
piously to that only one, that Marie has chosen vvhi^h shall not be taken
from her, that is, a will to please God. Martha does very well represent
the immodestye of the will, she is forvvard and eager, and sets all the
servants of the house a work, she goes hither and thither, with out stay,
so desirous is she to entreat our Lord well, and it seems to her there will
never be sufficient services of meat to make him good cheer. Even so the will
which is not restrained by Modesty, passes from one subject to another, to
provoke it self to love God, and to desire many means and vvayes to serve
him, and yet notvvithstanding there is no necessity of so many things, it
would be better to unite her self to God as Magdalene did; keeping her self
at his feet, demanding of him that he give us his love, then to think how,
and by what means we may get it. This Modesty bridle the the^ vvil^,
continually settling and closing it in the exercise of the means of her
aduan^ement in the love of God, according to the vocation in which we
remain. I have said that this virtue does principally employ it self to
subject the understanding, because the natural curiosity that we have is
very dangerouse, and causes that we never perfectly know any one thing:
for so much as we take not time sufficient to learn it well. It flies also
the other extremity of vice, which is opposite to it, that is dulnes and
negligence of spirit, which will not know that which is necessary. Now
this ^ubiection of the understanding is of very great ^mportance, for our
perfection: for look how much ^he will vveddeth it self to any thing, so much
the more earnest it is in the pursuit of it: and if the understanding shevve
unto the will the beauty of another, it deuerteth it from the first. The Bees
have no settled place, vvhiles they have not a king, never ^easing to fly
through the air, dispersing and scattering themselves having almost no repose
in their ^iue: but so soon as their king is borne; they gather ^hemselues all
together round about him, and go not forth but by the permission of their king
to ga^her their honnye. In like manner our understanding and will, our
passions, and the faculties of our soul, as spiritual Bees, until such time
as they have a king, that is to say, until such time as they have made choice
of our Lord JESUS for their king, have no repose, our senses never ceasing to
wander curiously, and to dravve our interior faculties after them, to
disperse them, sometimes after one subject, ^hen after another, and by this
means there is no other then a continual labor, and unquietness of spirit,
which makes us to loose the peace and tranquillity of spirit which is so
necessary for us, and this is that which the immodestie of the understanding,
and will, causes us. But from the time that our souls have chosen Our Lord
JESUS for their only fouueraigne king, her powers like chaste mystical Bees,
put themselves in order near to him, and never go forth from their Hiue but
for to gather the exercises of charity, that this holy king commands them
to practice toward their neighbor, and presently after, they return modestly
into this holy and amiable presence of their Lord for to gather and manage
discreetlye the honny o^ holy and amorous conceits and affections, which they
dravve from his sacred presence: and so they shall avoid the two extremities
aforesayed: cutting of on the one side curiosity of the understanding, by a
simple attention to God A^l, mighty and on the other side stupiditie, and
lazines of spirit, by the exercises of Charity that they shall practice
toward their neighbor, when it shall be requisite and necessary. But behold
another example touching this subject. On a day a certain Religiou^ man came
to the great Saint Thomas, and demanded of him what he should do, to
become very^ learned; In reading one only book, said he I read these days
past, The Rule that Saint Augustine made for Religious women; where he
says expressly, that the sisters may never read another books, then those
that shall be given them b^ their Superior; and after he gave the same
commandment to his Religious me^. So much knowledge had he of the evil, that
the curiosity of willing to know other things, then that which is
necessary for the better service of God (which a^ very fevv things) brings
to the soul: for if yo^ walk in simplicitye, by the observance of yo^ Rules,
without povvring out your selves, or sea^ching to know other things, you
shall perfectl^ serve God. Science or knowledge is not necessar^ to love God;
(as says Saint Bonauenture) for simple woman is as capable to love God, as
the most learned men in the world. There must be little knowledge, and very
much practice, in the which concerns perfection. I remember upon the
discourse, the danger there is in the curiosity of the will to know so many
means for the perfiting o^ it self. I spoke with two Religious women o^
two orders well reformed, one of them by the frequent reading of the books
of the Bl. S. Teresa, learned to speak so like her, that she seemed to be a
little Mother Teresa, and she believed it, so imagining in her self, all that
the holy Mother Teresa had done vvhilest she lived, that she thought to do the
very same, so far as to have had the bindings of the spirit, and suspensions
of the powers of the soul, even so as she did read the Saint had, so that
she spoke very well thereof. There are others, who have so effectually thought
on the life of S. Katherin of Sienna, and of the life of S. Katherin of Genes,
that they also thought themselves to be S. Katherins. Such souls as these, at
the least have contentment in themselves, by the imagination they have of being
Saints, although their contentment be vain. But the other Religious woman, I
spoke of, was of a very different humor: for so much as she never had
contentment, because of the auiditie she had to seek, and desire the way, and
method to perfect her self; and although she labored for it, nevertheless it
always seemed to her, that there was some other manner to perfect her, then
that which others did teach her. The one of these Religious women did live
content in her imaginary sanctity, and did not seek nor desire any other
thing and the other did live discontent, because her perfection was hidden,
and therefore she did allwaies desire some other thing. Interior modesty
retayneth the soul between these two estates in mediocritye to desire and
know that which is necessary, and no more. In fine it must be noted, that
the exterior modesty whereof we have spoken, serves very much to the
interior, and to the peace and tra^quillitie of the soul. The proof that all
the holy fathers have made thereof, who have made great profession of prayer,
does witnsse it. For they have all judged, that the most modest posture aydeth
most therein, as to set themselves on their knees their hands joined together,
or their arms a cross, or the like.

. 4. The third kind of Modesty regards our words, and manner of conuersing.
There are speeches which should be immodest out of the time of recreation,
where justly and with good reason, we ought to unbind the spirit a little;
and whosoever would not speak, nor permit others to speak, but of high
elevated matters in this time, should do immodestlie: For have we not said
that Modestye regards the time, the place, and the persons? To this purpose I
did read the other day, that S. Pachome upon his entry into the desert, to
lead a monastical life, had very great tentations, and the wicked spiritts
did appear to him often in diverse forms. He that wrote his life says, tha^
one day going to the wood to hevv, there came a great troop of infernal
spiritts to fright him, who ranked themselves as soldiers, that set the guard,
al^ very well armed, calling one to the other. Make place for the holy man;
S. Pachome that knevve very well, these vveere the soundes of the wicked
spirit, began to laugh saying; you mock me, but I will be one, if it please
God. Now the devil seeing that he could not entrap him, nor make him enter
into melancholy, thought that he would overtake him with joy, since he had
laughed at their first enterprise, so he went about to tie a great number o^
huge cords to a leaf of a tree and many devils did set themselves about
these cords, to dravve them with gteat violence, crying and swe^ating, as if
they had had great difficulty, the good Saint lifting vp^ his eyes, and
seeing this folly, did represe^t to himself our Lord JESUS Crucified on the
cross; they seeing that the S. did apply himself to the fruit of the tre^
and not to the leaf, went their ways all confounded and ashamed. There is a
time for laughing, and a ^ime not to laugh: as also a time to speak, and a
time to keep silence, as this glorious S. shows us ^n his tentations. This
Modesty co^poseth our man^er of speaking that it may be acceptable, speaking
neither too high nor too low, neither too slowly ^or too fast, retayning our
selves within the terms of holy mediocritie, permitting others to speak
without interrupting them, (for that sauoureth of ^abling) yet speaking in our
turn to avoid rusti^allnesse, which hinders us from being of good
^onuersation. Also oftentimes a person meets with occasions, where it is
necessary to speak with modesty, equallitie, patience, and tranquillitye.

. 5. The fourth virtue named Modesty ap^ertayneth to apparel, and manner of
dressing: where-of it is not needful to speak any other thing, then that
sluttishnes, and unseemliness, in ^he manner of apparelling of our selves,
must be ^uoyded; as also the other extremity, that is over much great care of
dressing our selves well, with ^ffected curiosity to be very fine, which is
vani^ye. But ciuilitye and cleanlines has been very much ^ommended by S.
Bernard, as being a great sign ^f the purity and sanctity of the soul. There
is an ^xample in the life of S. Hilarion, which seems ^ontrarie to this, for
one day speaking to a gentleman that was come to see him, he said to him,
that there was no appearance to look after cleanli^es in a hair shirte, as if
he had said, that we must not seek neatnes in our bodies, which are no
^ther then stinking carrion, and top full of infe^tion. But this was more
admirable in this great S. ^^en imitable.

Truly we must not have too much delicatnesse, ^et notwithstanding we must
not be sluttish; that which made this Saint speak in this so^^ was (if I be
not deceived) because he spoke before courtiers, that he did see so given
ouert^ delicatnesse, that it was needful for him to speak a little more
sharplye, as those that Will ma^^ straight a young tree, they do not only
se^ it straighte; but they bend it even to the other side, to the end it
return not to its former crookednes. Behold there what I had to say of
modesty.

. 6. You desire in the second place, to know, wha^ we must do to receive
correction well, that the feeling thereof remain not in us, or dryness o^
heart: To hinder the motions of choler to be felt i^ us, and the blood not to
rise in the face, will neue^ be. Happy shall we be, if we may be able t^
have this persectio^, a quarter of an hour before o^ death. But to keep
dryness of spirit, in such manner, that after the feeling is past, we cannot
speak^ with so much confidence, sweetness and tranquillity as before, o:
this, we must have a great ca^ not to do; You dismiss the feeling far of,
say yo^ but it cease not to return. I assure you, my dear daughters, that
you send it from you, it may be, a^ do the Cytizens of a town, wherein is
made sedition in the night, when they chase a way the seditious persons and
enemies; but they put the^ not out of the town, so that they hide themselu^^
going from street to street, until the day come, an^ then they cast themselves
upon the inhabitant^ and in fine remain Masters: you reject the fe^ling you
have of the correction, that is give you, but not so courageously and
carefully, that hides not it self in some little corner of yo^ heart, at least
some part of the feeling. You vv^ not have the feeling: neither will you
submi^ your judgment, which makes you belee^^ that the correction has been
given you vvrong^ully, or else that it has been done by passion, or ^he like:
who sees not, that these makebates ^vill set upon you, and ouervvhelme you
^uickly, with a thousand sorts of confusions? believe me, you chase them not
far of. But what must be done in this time? we must dravve near unto our
Lord IESV, and speak to him of some other thing. But your feeling is not
quieted, but it suggesteth to you to regard ^he vvrong has been done you. O
God; this is not the time; submitt your judgment, to make it ^eleeue and
confess, that the correction is good, and that it was given very justly; O
no, this ^s to be done after your soul shall be quiet ^gayne and pacified; for
in the time of trouble we must not speak, nor do any thing, upon any ^ermes
or reasons, but remain constant and reso^ute, not to consent to our passion,
for we shall never want reasons at that time, they will come ^hicke and
threefold: But not one must he hearkened unto, how good soever they seem to
be; But we must keep near to God as I have said; diuerting our selves,
after we be humbled and prostrate before his Majesty; speaking to him of
some other thing.

But mark this word, that pleases me very much to speak, because of the
profitt thereof, humble your selves with a svvete and a peaceful humilitye,
and not with a melancholy and troubled humility: for this is our unhappiness,
that we bring before God acts of troubled and spiteful humilitye, and by
this means our spiritts are not pacified, and these acts are unfruitful. But
if on the contrary we make these acts before the divine bounty, with a
svveet confidence, we should come away all cherefull and tr^^quille, and after
we should very easilye disauow^ all the reasons, (very often and ordinarilye
irreasonable) that our judgment and proper love do^ suggest unto us, and we
should go with the sam^ facilitye to speak to those, who have given us the
correction, or contradiction as before. You oue^come your self indeed (say
you) to speak to them but if they do not aunsvvere to you as you desire this
does redouble the tentation; all this proceedet^ of the same evil that we
have said: what impor^ it you, whether they speak after one fashion o^
another, so that you do your duty? Therefore a^ being well counted and
deducted, there is not an^ person that has not auersion to be corrected. S
Pachome after that he had lived forty or fiftye years in the desert in great
perfection, had a revelation from God, that he should gain a great number of
souls, and that many should come into the deserts, to place themselves under
his conduct: he^ had allreadie some Rcligious with him, and the first he
received was, his Brother named John, vvh^ was his elder Brother: S. Pachome
then began to enlarge his monastery, and to make a great numbe^ of cells; his
Brother John, either because he di^ not know his design, or otherwise for
the zeal^ he had to poverty, one day reprehended him very sharplye, saying
unto him, is it so, that yo^ ought, and mean to imitate our Lord IESV, wh^ had
not where-on to rest his head, vvhilest he wa^ in this world, to make so great
a convent? and other the like words to that purpose. S. Pachome allthough he
wear a great S. had such a feeling of thi^ reprehension, that he turned
himself on the other side, to the end (if I be not deceived) that the feeling
he had thereof might not appear in hi^ face: Then he went, and cast
himself on his knee^ before God, demanding pardon for his fault, and
^mplayning, for that, after he had remained so ^ng within the desert, he was
not yet mortifyed, ^aking so humble and fervent prayer, that he ob^^yned grace,
never more to be subject to impa^nce. Likewise S. Francis, toward the end of
his ^e, after he had had so many rapts, and amorous ^nions with God: after he
had done so much for ^s glory; and surmounted himself in so many ^rtes; one
day when he planted colworts in the ^rden, it happened that a Brother seeing
that he did ^ot plant them well, reprehended him, and the S. ^as moved with so
powerful a motion of chole^ at his reprehension, that he had almost uttered
iurious words against that Brother, that had re^^ehended him. He opened his
mouth to pro^unce it: but he restrained himself, and taking the dung that he
did bury with the collworts: ^ wicked tongue said he, I will teach the to
in^rye thy Brother, and presently prostrating him^^^fe on both his knees, he
besought the Brother to ^^rdon him. Now what reason is there I pray you ^at
we should be astonished to see our selves ^t to cholere, and if we have a
feeling when we ^e reprehended, or when some contradiction hap^eth unto us?
we must therefore take example ^om these Saints who did surmount themselves
continentlye, the one having recourse to prayer, ^^d the other humbly
demanding pardon of his ^rother; and neither the one nor the other did any
^ing in favor of their motion, but amended the^^^lues and made their profitt
of it. You tell me that ^ou accept of the correction with all your heart, ^^at
you approve it, and find it just and reasonable, ^ut this gives you a certain
confusion, in respect ^f the superior, because you have displeased her, or
^^uen her occasion to be angrye, and that this takes from you the confidence
to approach unto h^ notvvistanding you love the abiection that comes on you
for the fault. My daughter, this is do^ by the commandment of selfeloue;
know y^ not (it may be you do not) that there is in our s^ues, a certain
Monastery, whereof the Superio^ is selfeloue, and therefore it imposes
penances, a^ this pain is the penance it imposes upon yo^ for the fault you
have committed in displeasing (...) superior, because it may be she will not
estee^ you so much as she has done, if you had not fay^ in your duty; This is
enough for those who ^ceaue correction; I must speak a word for the that give
it. They ought to use very great disc^tion, to take a proper time for it, and
to do it w^ all due circumstances; besides, they must not b^ astonished or
meruaill; nor be offended to ^ those to whom they give it, to have a feeling^
trouble thereof; for it is a thing very grievous t^ person to see himself
corrected.

. 7. Thirdly you demand, how you may (...) able to carrye your spirit up
rightly before Go^ not svvaruing on the right hand, or on the l^^ My Dear
daughter; your proposition is very pl^sing to me, for so much as it brings
his a^^ were with it. You must do that you speak, goe^ God, looking neither
on the right hand, nor ^ the left. But it is not this that you demand, I ^
well; but what you may be able to do, to fix yo^ spirit in God in such
sort, that nothing may vnt^ nor dravve it back. Two things are necessary
(...) this, to die, and to be saved. For after this there she never be any
separation, and your spirit shall indissolubly fastened and united to God. You
say y^ this is not that which you demand; but it is, w^ you may do to hinder,
that the least fly do (...) with draw your spirit from God, as it does, y^
would say the least distraction, Pardon me, my dau^^ter, the least fly of
distraction does not with^awe your spirit from God, so as you say: For no^^ing
withdraws us from god but sin; and the ^^solution we have made in the
morning, to keep ^ur selves united to God, and attentive to his pre^nce,
causes that we remain allwaies there, yea so when we sleep, since we
do it in the ^^me of God, and according to his most holy will: seems that
his divine bountye has said to us, ^eepe and rest, and in the mean time, I
will watch ^uer you, for to keep and defend you from the ^reing lion, who
goes allwaies round about ^ou to defeat you: Consider then if you have ^ot
reason to take your rest modestly, as I have ^yed: for the means to do all
things well that ^ee do, is to be attentive to the presence of ^od; for
seeing that he does behold us, who ^f us will offend him? venial sins of
them^^lues are not capable to divert us out of the way, ^at conducteth us to
God: they stay us without ^oubt a little in our way, but they do not
therefore ^^rne us back, and much less simple distractions, and this I have
declared in the Introduction; As ^or prayer, it is no less profitable to us,
nor less ^^easing to God, for having many distractions but ^ may be, it
shall prove more profitable, then (...) we had had many consolations; because
there is ^ore labor therein, provided notwithstanding that ^ee must have
fidelity to withdraw, our selves from these distractions, and not willingly
permit ^ur spirit to rest, or pause on them. The same is to ^e said of the
pain that we have all the day long ^o settle our spiritts in god, and
celestial things: so that we have care to retain our spirit, from run^ing
after these flies and butter flies; as a mother ^oth with her child, seeing her
little one affected to run after the butterflyes, thinking to ca^^ them, she
withdraws him, withhoulding hi^ presentlye by the arms, saying to him, My
chil^ thou will take cold to run after those butter fly^ in the sun, it is
better that thou stay with me: the poor child remains until such time as
he see^ another, after the which he should be as readie^ run, if his mother
did not withhould him as before; but what must we do then, we must ha^
patience, and not be weary of our labor, since^ is undertaken for the love
of God? But if I be n^ deceived, when we say that we cannot find Go^ and
that it seems to us that he is far from w^ we would say that we cannot
have the feeling (...) his presence; I have observed that many make n^
difference between God and the feeling of Go^ betvveene faith and the feeling
of faith, which i^ very great defect: it seems to them, that when the^ feel
not God, that they are not in his presence, a^ this is ignorance. For a person
vv^o goes ^o suff^^ martyrdom for God notwithstanding should n^ think on God
at the present, but on the pain: a^ though he have not the feeling of faith:
he is n^ excluded from meritt in respect of his first resol^tion, but executes
an act of great love. There is great difference, to have the presence of God (I
v^derstand to be in his presence) and to have the fe^ling of his presence.
There is not any but God hi^ self, that may grant us this grace: For to give
yo^ the means to obtain this feelieg is not possib^ for me. Do you demand
what must be done should ones self allwaies with great respect before God, as
being most unworthy of his grace? The^ is no other means to do it, then as
you say: consider that he is our God, and that we are his weak^ creatures,
unworthy of this honor, as S. Franc^^ did, who passed a whole night,
interrogating wit^ God in these terms, who art thou? and who am I? ^^fine if
you demand of me what I shall do to ^^eyne the love of God? I will tell you,
in desiring ^oue him, and in place of applying your selves think and ask,
what you may do to unite ^ur spirit to God, set your selves to practice it,
a continual application of your spirit to God, ^ I assure you, you shall
sooner arrive to your ^tence by this means, then by any other way: (...)
according to the measure that we disperse our ^^es, so much less are we
recollected, and there^e less capable of uniting our selves with the diui^
majesty who will have us all without any reser^^^ion. Truly there are souls
who busye themsel^^^ so much to think, what they shall do, thar ^y have not
time to do it; and notwitstanding in ^t which regards our perfection, which
confi^th in the union of our soul with the divinity, know little, and to
do much, is our way with^^t doubt: it seems to me, that those of whom ^u
ask the way to heaven, have great reason to ^nswer, as they who say; that to
go to such a place, ^u must allwaies go, setting one foot before other, and
by this means, you shall come where ^u desire, walk allwaies, say they, to
these souls ^sirous of their perfections, walk in the way of ^ur vocation in
simplicity, and let your study (...) to effect, more then to desire, this is
the shor^st way.

. 8. But behold a subtilitie, that I must, if it ease you to permit me,
discover unto you, with^^t offending you; to wit, you wou^d I should ^uch you
a way of perfection allreadie perfected, (...) such sort as there weere no
other thing to be do^, then to put it over ^our head, as you do your ^bitt,
and then, by this means you should find ^^ur selves perfect without pain,
that is to say I should give you in an instant perfection allre^ made; For
that, I say, we must do, is not agre^ to nature; is not this that we would
have? (...) truly if t^is were in my power, I should (...) the most perf^ct
man of the world; For if I co^ give perf^ction unto others without doing
(...) thing, I assure you I would first learn it my se^ It seems to you
that perfection is an art, (...) if one could find the secreat thereof, he
sho^ have it without labor. Truly you dece^ your selves, for there is no
greatter secreet the^ work and labor faithfully in the exercise^ divine
love, if you pretend to unite your selves ^ the well-beloved. But I would
willingly (...) you did mark: that when I say you must vvor^ I always
intend to speak of the superio^ part of our soul: For notvvitstanding all
(...) repugnances of the inferior, we must be (...) more astonished, then
passengers are at dog^ that bark a far of. They who at a feast, tak^ taste
of every dish, eatting somvvhat of each k^ of meat, with this variety
ouerturne their sto^acke, and cause so great indisgestion that it hindr^^ them
from sleeping all the night, neither can the do any other thing then spitte:
even so the sou^ that desire to taste of all methodes, and means t^^ lead, or
may conduce to perfection, do the ve^ same; for the stomach of their will
not haui^ sufficient heat to disg^st, and put in practice so m^^ means, there
is made there a certain cruditie, a^ indisgestio^, which takes away their
peace and t^^quillitie of spirit to dravve near unto our Lo^^ which is the
only thing necessary that Man has chosen and shall never be taken from her.

Let us pass now to that other demand, t^^ you proposed to me, that is,
what you may d^ to strengthen your resolutions so well, that the m^ spring
forth and come to good effect. There ^o better means (my child) then to put
them in ^^tice: but you say you are always frail, and (...) although you
do often make strong resolu^s, not to fall into the imperfections that you de^
to amend, if the occasion present it self, you fail to stumble and lay your
nose on the ground, ^ld you have me tell you, why we remain vveake? it is
because we will not abstain ^n unwholesome meats: it is even as if a parson
(...) would not have the pain of the stomach, ^aske of a physician what she
should do: he ^uld aunsvvere her, that she must not eat of (...) and such
meats, because they engender crudi^ which do cause pain afterward: but
she (...) not abstain from them. We do even the (...) same; we would (for
example) love corre^ well: but we will nevertheless be obstinate: that a
folly is this? this cannot be, you will ^er be able and strong to support
correction cou^ously, whiles you eat of the fruit of proper ^mation. I would
very willingly keep my ^e, recollect, and nevertheless I will not ab^^ge
so many sorts of unprofitable reflections. ^s may not be. Good God! I would
be inuaria^ and very fervent in my exercises; but also I ^uld not willinglye
have so much pain; in a ^de I would find the business allreadie dispatched:
may not be granted during this life, wherein we ^l allwaies have difficulty
and labor. The feast ^he Purification (as I have said to you once ^re) has
not an Octaue. Of necessity we must ^e two equal resolutions, the one to see
vveedes we in our garden; and the other to have the ^rage to see them pluckte
up by the roots, and ^lucke them up our selves: for our self loue-will ^er
dye vvhiles we live: it being self-love, that causes these impertinent
productions. Moreo^ it is not to be frail, to fall sometimes into ve^^
sins, so that we raise our selves immediatlye the return of our soul to
God, meeklie and g^tlye humbling our selves: we must not think^ live with out
committing some: for there has been any, (Our Bl. Lady excepted) that has
this privilege: truly although they stay us a (...) (as I have said) they
do not divert us so much^ of the way, but that one only regard of God
^^lisheth the^, in fine we must know, that we o^ never to cease from making
good resolutions though we see very well, that according to our ^dinarie we
practice them not; yea when we ^^ceaue very well, it is impossible to
practice t^^ when occasion shall present it self; and this (...) be done with
more stabilitie, then if we felt in ^ selves, sufficient courage for to bring
our enterp^ to good effect, saying to our Lord, it is true^ Lord, that I shall
not have the strenght to doe^ support such a thing of my self, but I rejoice
for much as it shall be thy streinght which will wor^ in me; and upon this
foundation we must to battaill courageously, and do not doubt, but ^ shall
have the victory. Our Lord does tovv^^^ us, even the very same that a good
Father or ^ther, who permit their child to go alone, w^ he is in a soft
medovve where the grass is v^ grown, or upon moss: because if he happen
fall it vvil be no great harm: but in the ill and ^^gerous ways they carrye
him carefully in t^ arms. We have often seen souls to supp^ couragiouslye
diverse great assaults, not having ^ne overcome of theit enemies, who with
while have been overcome in slight encounter^ why so? because our Lord seeing
it could do t^ no great harm to fall, left them to go alon^ th^mselues, the
which he did not do when they ^ere in the desperate terms of great
temptations, (...) of which he drew them by his Allmighty ^vver. Paula who
was so generous to forsake the ^rld, quitting the city of Rome, and so great
^ndance of all things, and who could not be sha^ by the Motherly affection she
bare to her ^dren, so resolute was she to forsake all for God, ^er she had
effected all these great meruailes, she ^mitted herself to be surmounted, by
the tenta^n of her proper judgment, which made her be^ue, that she ought not
to submitt her self to the ^^ise of many holy persons, who did desire her
withdraw somevvhat of her ordinary auste^es; wherein S. Hierome auovveth
that she was ^rehensible. Let us mark well for conclusion, (...) all
whatsoever we have declared in this dis^rse, are things very delicate
concerning perfe^^, and therefore let none of you that have heard ^m be
affrighted or afflicted, if she find not her ^e to have arrived to this
perfection, since by the ^ce of God, you have so good courage to desire, (...)
pretend, the attayning thereunto.

THE TENTH ENTERTAINMENT.
OF OBEDIENCE.
1. Obedience is a moral virtue, which depends of Justice now there are
certain ^orall virtues which have so great affinitye with (...) virtues
Theological (which are Faith, hope, and charity) that they seem as it weere
Theolo^call, although they be in a degree very inferior Penance, Religion,
Justice, and Obedience: No Obedience consists in two points, the first is
obey Superiors, the second to obey our equall^ and inferiors: But this second
appertains rat^ to humility, gentleness and charity, then to O^dience; For
the person that is humble, thinks t^ all others surpass her, and are better
then she ^ such sort that she esteems them her Superio^^ and believes that
she ought to obey them. (...) touching the Obedience that regards the
Su^riours, that God has established over us to goue^ us, it is of Justice and
necessity, and we ou^ to render it unto them with entire submission our
understanding and will. Now this Obedie^ of the understanding is practiced,
when being ^maunded, we accept and approve the commau^ment, not only with
our will; but also with ^ understanding, approving and esteeming the the that
is commanded, and judging it better, ^ any other thing that they might have
commaun^ us upon this occasion When one is come to t^ then they love so to
Obey, that they desire ins^ably to be commanded, to the end that all t^ do,
be done by Obedience: This is the Obed^ of the perfect, and that which I
desire for (...) which proceeds from the pure gift of God (...) otherwise is
gotten with long time and lab^ and by a great number of re^terated acts, and
p^duced with a lively force, by the means when of we gain the habitt and
facillitye thereof. (...) natural inclination allwaies carries us to desir^
command, and gives us an auersion to Obey: (...) notvvithstanding it is
certain that we have m^ capacity to Obey, and it may be we have non^ all to
command.

. 2. Obedience most ordinarilye has three ^onditions, the first is to accept
with a good will ^e thing that they command us, and to apply our ^ill
sweetly thereunto loving to be commaun^ed; for it is not the way or means to
yeald our ^lues truly obedient, to have no person to com^aund us: as likewise
it is not a means to be ^ilde to remain alone in a desert. Cassian repor^th
that being in the desert, he was sometimes in ^holer, and taking his pe^ to
write, if it did not write ^ell, he should cast it from him; vvhere-fore said
^ee, it serves for nothing to be alone, since that ^ee carrye cholere with
us. Virtue is a good of it ^lfe, that depends not of the privation of his
^ontrarie. The second condition of obedience is ^romptitude, to the which
sloth, or spiritual sadness opposite; For it rarelye happens, that a sorrowful
^ule does any thing promptly, and diligently, (in ^heologicall terms, sloth
is called spiritual sor^owe) and this is it which hinders from execu^ng
obedience courageously, and promptlye. The ^ird is perseverance: for it
suffices not, that we ^onsent to the commandment, and that we ^ecute it
for some space of time, if we do not ^erseuere therein, since it is this
perseverance that ^bteyneth the crown. There are every where to ^e found
admirable examples of perseverance but ^rticularlye in the life of Saint
Pachome; there is ^ention of diverse monks, that perseuered with ^ incredible
patience, all their life employing the^^elues, in one and the self same
exercise, as the ^ood Father Jonas, who never in his life did any ^ther thing
(besides gardening) then make matts, and he was so habituated, that he made
them, his ^indowe being shut close, meditating and making ^is prayer, and the
one did not hindet the other in ^im, in such sort that they found him dead
with his knees acrosse, and his matts fastened upon the^ he did dye doing of
that which he had done a^ his life. This was an act of great humility, for
ob^bedience to imploye himself in this self same exercise being so abject all
his life: For strong tempt^tions might arrive unto him, that he should be
c^pable of some office of more vvorth. Now thi^ third condition is most
difficult of all, because (...) the lightness ad inconstancy of humayne
spiritts; for at this present we love to do one thing, and b^ and by we
will not regard it, if we would follow all the motions of our spirit, or
that it we^^ possible for us so to do, without giving scanda^ ther-in, or
dishonoring our selves, we should s^^ no other thing then chang and
instabilitye. No^ we would be in one condition, and a while aft^ we would
seek for another, so extrauagant an^ inconstant, is the spirit of man:
Therefore it mu^ be stopped by the force of our first resolutions, t^ the end
we may live equally, in the throng of t^^ inequallities of our feelings,
successes, and euen^ Now to give our selves affectionatly to Obedienc^ when we
shall find our selves tempted, we oug^ to make considerations of the
excellency, beauty and meritt, yea also the profitt thereof: for to e^courage
us to pass onvvarde; This is to be vnde^stood for those souls, that are not
yet well establ^shed in Obedience: but when there is no question but of a
simple auersion, or disgust of the thing commanded, we must make on act of
love, and p^ our selves to the work. Our Lord JESUS himself in his passion,
did feel a very great distaste, and mortal auersion to suffer death: he
says it himself: but with the subtle point of his spirit h^ was resigned
to the will of his Father; all the r^^ was but a motion of nature. Perseverance
is mo^ difficult in interior things; for the exterior a^ material are easy
enough, which proceeds from ^his, that we are troubled to subject our
vnder^^anding, for this is the last piece that we submitt; and
notwithstanding it is entirely necessary, that ^ee subject our thoughs to
certain objects; in ^uch sort, that when our superior does give us set
^xercises, or practice of virtue, we remain in those exercises, and submitt
our spirit. I do not all it want of perseverance when we make some ^mall
interruptions, so that we quit it not alltoge^her: as it is not want of
Obedience, to be defe^tiue in one of her conditions, provided that we ^re
not obliged but to the substance of the virtues, and not to the conditions: For
allthough that we do obey with repugnance, and almost as it weere ^y
force, by the obligation of our condition, our Obedience notwithstanding
omitteth not therefote ^o be good, in virtue of our first resolution: But it
is ^f an infinitt worth and meritt, when it is perfor^ed with the conditions
that we have nominated, or any one thing how little soever it be, being
^ffectuated with such Obedience, is of excellent ^vorth.

. 3. Obedience is a virtue so excellent, that ^ur Lord JESUS would guide all
the course of his ^fe by Obedience, eue^ so as he said many times, that he
was not come to do his will, but that of ^is Father: and the Apostle says,
that he was ^ade Obedient even unto death, and the death of ^he cross: and
he would join to the infinite meritt ^f his perfect Charity, the infinitt
meritt of perfect Obedience; Charity gives way to Obedience, because
Obedience depends of Justice. also it is ^etter to pay that we owe, then
to give an alms, that is to say, it is better to Obey, then to do acts ^f
Charity by our own proper motion.

The second point vvher-in Obedience consists is rather humility then
Obedience, for this kind^ of Obedience is a certain flexiblenes of our will^
to follovv the will of another, and this is a virtue that is exceedinglye
pleasing; which causes our spirit to wind it self in all occasions, and
allwaies disposes us to do the will of God: For example, if i^ passing to
one place I meet a sister that desiret^ me to go to another: the will of God
in me is that I do as she desires, rather the^ that I will. Bu^ if I oppose
my opinion to hers, the will of God in h^ is, that she give me way, and the
like in all things that are indifferent: But if it happen upon this fir^
opinion both will yeald and give way, they must no^ stay there contesting: but
they shall have regard ^ that which is best and most reasonable, and simpl^
do it, but in this we must be guided by discreti^ for it should be far
from the purpose, to qui^ a thing that were of necessity, to condescend to
thing indifferent. If I would execute an action ^ great mortificatio^, and
another sister should com^ to me, and bidd me not to do it, or that I do^
some other. I would remitt my first design if were possible until another
time, for to do h^ will, and then afterward, I would dispatch m^ undertaken
mortification, But if I could not omi^ or remitt it, and that this that she
would have me, were not necessary, I ought to do that, which I had first
undertaken: and then if I could, I wou^ regaine the commodity to do that
which the sist^ did desire of me. But if it happen that a sister reque^ us to
do something for her, and that through so daynesse, or surprise, we show our
selves disguste^ therevvhith, the sister must not be ielous, or m^strust, nor
make semblance of knowing or marki^ it, neither must she desire that it be not
done, for is in our power to hinder our eyes and our coun^^nance from
demonstrating the co^bat that we ha^ within us; allthoug reason would gladly
perform that is desired: For these are messengers that come without sending
for, and although we bidd them ^tourne, ordinarily they do nor stir. To
what ^urpose then, would not this sister have me to do ^at she desired,
only because she knovveth I have ^d repugna^ce thereunto? she ought to desire
that I ^ake profitt of this for my soul. You will say, it is because she
fears that she has displeased you. No, ^is self love that would not that I
should have the ^ast thought, that she is importune; I shall have it
^otwitsta^ding, although I stay not my self therein* ^oreouer, if to the
signs of my repugnance, I add ^ords, that plainly witness, I have no desire
to do ^at which this sister desired of me, she may and ^ght sweetly to pray
me, that I do it not, when ^e: persons are equal for those that have
authority ^ust hold themselves resolute, and they must cause ^eir inferiors
to be pliable to them. Now al^ough a sister should absolutelye refuse me
some^^ing, or manifest the disgust she has, I ought not to ^ose confidence to
employ her another time, neither ^ght I to be disedified with her
imperfection; For the present I support her, and within a while she ^ll
support me, Now she has auersion from doing this thing, and another time she
will willingly ^e it: Notwithstanding if I have had experience, that ^s was
such a spirit, as were not as yet capable to ^e entreated in this manner, I
would expect a while ^ull such time as the were better disposed we are ^ of us
capable of the defectes one of another, and ^e must in no sort whatsoever be
astonished to ^ounter the^, for if we remain sometime with falling into a
fault, with in a while it will happen ^t we shall do no other thing then
fail, and ^^mitt many great imperfections, whereof it ^^w^th, that we must
profit our selves, by the abiection that happens to us there-vppon. VVe^ ought
also to suffer the dela^ of our perfection ^ith patience, always doing that
which we are abl^ for our advancement, and that hartelye, and willingly.

. 4. O how happy are those, who living i^ expectation, are not vvearied out
with expecting this I say for many, who having a desire to perfe^ themselves,
by the acquisition of virtues, vvoul^ have them all in an instant, as if
perfection co^sisted in no other thing then to desire it. It vvoul^ be an
exttaordinarie great benefitt, if we could b^ humble, even so soon as we
have a desire to be so, without further pain* we ought to accustom^ our
selves, to examine diligently the success of ou^ perfection, according to the
ordinary ways, in tr^quillitie of heart, doing all that is in our power^
gain virtues by the fidelity that we shall have ^ practice them, each one
according to her condition and vocation, and expecting with patience the
a^tayning, soon, or late, the end that we preten^ committing this to the
divine providence, wh^ will have care to comfort us, in the time he ha^
appointed for it: and if this should I not be vnt^ the hour of our death,
we ought to suffer it, pr^uided that we do our duty, in performing a^waies
that which is in our power, we shall ha^ soon enough that we desire, when
that we she obtain it, and that it shall please almighty. God^ give it us.
This attending and resignation is mo^ necessary for the want thereof hinders
and tro^bleth a soul very much* we must be content^ know that we do well
by him vvho^ gouerne^ us, and not to seek after feelings, or particul^
knowledge: but walk as blind, within this pro^dence and confidence in God:
yea even in the th^kest of desolations, fears, darkness, and all ot^ kind of
crosses, if it please our Lord that we shall ^aue them: remaining perfectly
abandoned to his ^ouerment, with out any exception or reservation ^hatsoeuer,
permitting him to do all, casting upon ^s bounty the whole care of body and
soul, ^esting also wholy resigned and immovable in ^od, under the government
of Superiors, having ^o other care then to obey. Now the means to ^bteyne
this flexiblenesse to the will of another is ^ prayer to make acts of
indifferencye very often ^d seriously, and then to put them in practice ^hen
occasion shall present it self: For it is not enough to cast our selves before
God, for so much ^ this being done only with the Imagination, ^ere is no
great matter in it; but when it is to be ^erformed in effect, and that coming
to give our ^lues wholy to God we shall find a creature that ^ill command
us, we shall find a difference, and here it is where we must show our
courage. ^his gentleness and condescendance to the will of ^ur neigbour is a
very precious virtue, and resem^leth much the prayer of union: for as this
prayer ^ no other thing, then a renouncing of our selves ^ God; when the soul
says with verity, I have ^ other will but thine O Lord, then is she wholly
^nited unto God; likewise allwaies renounceing ^ur will to do that our
neighbor desires, is true ^ion with our neighbor, and all this must be ^ne
for the love of God. It happens often that such ^ersons as are little and
vveake, both in body and ^iritt, who will exercise themselves but in small
^atters, will do them with such Charity, that they ^all far surpass the
meritt of great and elevated ^tions; for ordinarily these high and great acts
are ^ade with less charity, because of the attention, ^d of diverse
considerations that are made about ^em. Yet nevertheless if a great work be
done with as much Charity, as a little one, vvitho^ doubt he shall have much
more meritt and ^^warde that does it. In fine, Charity gives t^^ prize and
vvorth to all our works, in such manne^ that all the good that we do, we
must do it for the love of God; and the evil that we avoid, m^ be avoided
for the love of God. The good act^ons that we do, which are not
particularly commanded us, and which cannot dravve their men from Obedience,
it must be given them by Ch^ritie, allthough we may do all by Obedienc^ In
breife we must have a good courage, and d^pend of God only, For the
Character of the Religious of the Visitation is, to regard the will ^ God in
all things and to follow itt.

. 5. You have asked of me heretofore, if yo^ may say particular prayers, I
aunsvvere, that to^ching those short prayers, that you have devotion unto
sometimes, it is not amiss, so that you d^ not tie your selves unto them, in
such sort, that they be not said you have a scruple thereof: ^ that you
determine to say every day, or during year, or a certain time, some prayer
according ^ your fantasye; for this must not be done; but som^times in the
time of silence, if we have devotion ^ say an Aue Maris stella, or a Veni
Creator, there^ not any difficulty, but that we may say it, and it^ good,
but we must be very warye, that this b^ done without prejudice of a greater
good, as f^ example, if you have devotion before the Bl. Sacr^ment, to say
three Pater nosters in honor of the Blessed Trinity, and that you be called
to do some other thing, you should rise presently, an^ readily go to
perform that action to the hono^ of the Blessed Trinity, in stead of the
three Pat^ nosters: therefore we must not prescribe to o^ selves the making
of a certain number of gen^ flectio^s, and Iaculatorie prayers, and the like
daily ^^actices, or during any time, without declaring it ^ the Superior,
although we must be very fayth^^ll in the practice of eleuations, and
aspirations to ^od. Now if you think that it is the Holy spirit, ^ho in
spireth you to make those kind of exercises ^u will be willing to demand leave,
yea likewise ^ot to perform them, if they will not permit ^ou, for so much
as there is nothing so acceptable as ^eligious Obedience. You must not promise
a per^^n to say any number of prayers for them: if they ^aye you to do it, you
must aunsvvere you will ^ke leave: but if they recommend themselves sim^ly to
your prayers, you may aunfvvere that you ^ill do it willingly, and even in
the same time ^ise up your spirit to God for that person: even so ^^kevvise in
the Blessed Sacrament, for you may not ^ommunicate without leave for any
person, this is ^ot to be understood when being ready to re^eaue our Lord
IESV, in the Sacrament; if there came ^^to your mind the necessity of any one
of your ^ceinds, or the common necessity of the people, that you may not
recommend them to God, in sup^licating him to have compassion of them. But if
^ou would communicate particularlye for any ^^ing, you must ask leave, if it
be not for your ^vvne necessities, as to obtain streinght against ^ome
tentation, or else to obtain some virtues of ^ur Lord, who be ever Blessed.
Amen.

THE ELEAVENTH DISCOVRSE.
UPON THE SAME SVBIECT O^ Obedience; Of the virtue of Obedience.
. 1. THere are three sorts of pious Obedience^ vvhere-of the first is general
to all Christians, which is the Obedience due to God, and to the Holy Church,
in the observance of their commandementes. The second is Religious Obedience,
which is of far greatter price then the other, because it is not only tied
to the commandments of God: but subiecteth it self to his cou^cells. There
is a third Obedience, which is this where-of I inte^d to speak, as being the
most perfect, which is called amorous Obedience: and this is that same, which
our Lord has shevveed us example of, all the time of his life. The holy
Fathers have given to this kind of Obedience many properties and conditions:
but among them I will choose only three, vvhere-of the first is, that it is
(as they name it) blind: The second, that it is prompt, the third that it is
perseuerant. Blind Obedience has three properties or conditions: The first
that it looks not on the face of the Superiors, but only on their
authority; The second that it informs not it self of reasons, nor of the
motives the Superiors have to command such or such a thing, it suffices, to
know, they have commanded it; and the third, that it enquireth not the
means, which it must have to do that which is commanded, being assured
that God, by whose inspirations the commaundment is made, will also give
ability to accomplish it: but in stead of enquiring how she shall do it, she
puts her self to it. ^^ligiouse Obedience, the which should be blind
^omitteth, her self Lovingly to do all that is co^^aunded her simply, with
out ever regarding ^hether the commandment be well or ill made, that they who
command have power to com^unde, and that the commandment serve to the
^niunction of our spirit with God: for out of it ^ue Obedience never does any
thing. Many are ^eatly deceived about this condition of Obedience, ^ho have
believed, that it consists in doing all ^at should be commanded us, be it
right or ^rong, weere it even against the commaunde^ents of God and Holy
church: wherein they ^ue greatly erred, imagining follye in this blind^s,
where there is none: for in all that which con^^rneth the commandments of
God, as the Su^^riours have never any power to make any com^aundement
contrary, so likewise the inferiors ^uer have any obligation to obey in such
case. For they should Obey therein, they should sin. Now know very well, that
many have done things co^^^arie to the co^maun^dements of God by the instinct ^
this Obedience (which will not only Obey the ^^mmaundements of God and
Superiors, but also ^^eir counsels and inclinations) Many have preci^tated
themselves to death, by a particular inspira^on from God, which was so strong
that they ^^uld in no sort gaynsaye it: for otherwise it had ^ene in them a
grievous sin. It is related in the ^ird book of the Machabees, that one named
Ra^as who being thrust forvvard with an arde^t zeal (...) the Glory of God,
went and exposed himself ^ blows vvherof he knew he could not auoy^
wounds and death: and feeling himself to be wounded in the breast, he
drew out all his entrails ^y this vvound, then he cast them in the air, in
the presence of his enemies. Saint Apolonia cast h^^ self into the fire which
the enimyes of God, and (...) Christian faith had prepared to put her into, t^
kill her Saint Ambrose reports the history (...) three virgins, who to
avoid the loss of the chastity cast themselves into a river, and vve^
drowned in the waters, but these had other manner of reasons to do thus,
which would be too long to declare in this place. There are diue^ others,
that have precipitated themselves to death as he that cast himself into a
burning furnace: a^ these examples ought to be admired not imitate^ for you
know sufficiently, that we must never be^ so blind, as to think to please
God by transgressing his commandments.

. 2. Amorous Obedience presupposes th^^ we be obedient to the commandment
(...) God, they say that this Obedience is blind, because it obeys equally to
all Superiors. Al^ the ancient Fathers have blamed those very much who
would not submitt themselves to the Obedience of those, who were of less
quality the^ themselves: Of whom they did demand, when you did obey your
Superiors; wherefore di^ you do it? was it for the love of God? nothin^ so;
For has not this person the same place amo^g^^ us, as the other had? without
doubt he is the vicar of God, and God by his mouth commands us, and causes
us to understand his vvil^ by his ordinances, even as he did by the mouth of
the other. You therefore obey the Superiors because you have an inclination to
them, as for respect of their persons. Alas, Alas! you do no^ more then
worldlings; for they do the veri^ same, and not only obey they the
commandments of those whom they love, but they would not esteem their love
well satisfied, (...) they did not follow as near as they could their
^nclinations and affections, even as the true Obedi^nt does toward his
superiors as to god himself. The Panimes, ac wicked as they were, ^aue
shevved us example of this: for the devil ^pake to them in diverse sorts of
Idols, some of them were statues of men, others of Rats, dogs, ^iones,
serpents, and the like things, and these poor poeple did equally adioyne
faith to all; being as ^bedient to the statue of a dog, as to that of a man,
and to that of a ratt, as to that of a lion, without any difference: why did
they this? because they ^id respect their Gods in these statues. Saint Paul
^o^maundeth us to obey our Superiors allthough ^hey should be wicked. Our
Lord, Our Lady, and Saint Joseph have taught us very well this manner of
Obedience, in the voyage they made from Nazareth to Bethleem: for Caesar having
^ade an edict, that all his subjects should assem^le to the places where they
were borne for to ^ee enrolled, they went lovingly thither to satisfy ^is
Obedience, although Caesar was a Panyme ^^d Idolater. Our Lord would show by
this, that we never ought to regard the face of those ^ho command, provided
they have power to ^ommand.

. 3. Let us now pass to the second property (...) blind Obedience. After
this point is gained, ^ot to consider those who command, but to sub^itt our
selves equally to all sorts of superiors, ^e may pass further, and come to
the second. which is to obey without consideration of the in^on or the end
wherefore the commandment made, contenting her self to know that it is
^ade, without consideration, whether it be well, ^ill, or whether they have
reason, or not, to make such or such a commandment. Abraham became very
recommendable in this Obedience, God called him, and said to him, Abraham go
forth of thy country, and from thy kindred, that is to say, out of thy city,
and go unto the place, which I will shevve thee. Abraham went without reply.
Alas might not he very well have said; Lord tho^ bidst me go out of the
city, tell me then if tho^ please by which side I shall go forth? he said
not a word, but went his way whither the spirit carried him, not regarding
in any sort, whether he went well or ill, wherefore, or for what intention.
God had given him this commandment so sodaynely, that he had not so much as
appointed him the way which he should take. O! certaynlie tru^ Obedience
makes no discourse, but sets it self simply to the work, not inquiring
any other thing then to obey. It seems that our Lord himself would show
unto us, how much this kind (...) Obedience was acceptable unto him, when he^
appeared to Saint Paul to convert him; for having called him by his name, he
made him fall to the ground, and struck him blind: do you not no^ how to make
him his disciple, he cast him dovvn^ to humble him, and subject him to
himself? then i^ an instant he made him blind, and commanded him to go
into the city to seek out Ananias, and tha^ he must do all that, which he
should commaun^ him. But wherefore did not our Lord himself tel^ him what he
should do, without referring hi^ to another, since he had vouchsafed to
speak to him for his conversion? S. Paul did all that vva^ commanded. It had
cast our Lord nothing to hau^ told him himself, that which he caused A nam^
to do: but he would that we should know (...) this example, how much he
loves blind Obedience since that it seems, he had not made Saint Pa^nd, but
to become truly Obedient. When our lord gave sight to the man borne blind,
he made ^ay, and put it upon his eis, commanding him to ^e wash in the
fountain of Silo. Might not this ^ore blind man have been amazed at the
means, ^here of our Lord made use to heal him, and say ^o him; Alas; what
will you have me to do, if weere not blind, this weere enough to make me
^ose my sight? He made none of all these consi^^rations, but obeyed simply:
eue^ so the true Obe^ent, believe simply they can do all that any a command
them, because they hold that all ^e commandments come from God, or are made
(...) his inspiration, the which cannot be impossible (...) reason of the
power of him who commands. ^aiman the Syrian, did not the like, whereby he
^posed himself to danger: for being a leaper, he ^ent to find out Eliseus to
heal him, because ^t all the remedies, that he had made use of to ^ouer his
former health, did serve him to no pur^^se. Hearing that Eliseus did work
great mer^^les, he went unto him, and being arrived, he ^t unto him, one of
his servants, to beseech him be pleased to cure him. Whereupon Eliseus
(...) coming forth of his chamber, sent him a mes^^ by his servant, that he
should vvash himself ^uen times in sordayne and be healed. At this ^^swer
Naiman began to be displeased, and said: ^e there not as good waters in our
country as ^se are of the River of Jordan? and he would not ^e thither: But
his followers did show unto him thee should do well to do as the Prophett
en^ned him, since it was so easy a thing. He being ^^^swaded by their words,
vvashed seven times (...) was healed. You see he put himself, in danger
(...) to recover his health, by making so many con^ratious upon that which
was commanded.

. 4. The third property of blind Obedience (...) that she co^sidereth not, nor
enquireth not so much by what means she shall be able to do that which is
commanded her. She knows that the way whe^by she ought to go is the Rule of
Religion, and the commandments of superiors, she takes this wa^ in
simplicitye of heart, without exception, whe^^ it were better to do so, or so
provided that (...) obey all equallye: for she knows very well, the this
suffices to be acceptable to God, for vvho^ love she obeyth purely and
simply. The second condition of loving Obedience is, that it is promp^ Now
promptitude of Obedie^nce has allwaies be^ recomended to the Religious, as a
most necessari^ piece to obey well, and perfectly to observe the which they
have vowed to God. This was the to^ that Eliezer took to know the virgin*
that Go^ had ordained to be the spouse of his Masters so^n^ He said to
himself, the virgin of whom I sha^ demand drink, and she shall answer
me, I (...) not only give you, but furthermore I will dra^ water for your
camells, by this I shall know h^ to be a worthy spouse for the son of my
Maiste^ and as he thought upon this, he saw a far ^ the fair Rebecca:
Eliezer seeing her so fair and gracious; drew near the well, where she sho^
draw water for her sheep, he made his demau^^ and the damsel answered,
according to his desig^ yeas, said she, not only to you, but to your ^mells
also. Mark I pray you how ready and gr^tious she was, she did not spare her
labor but w^ very liberal thereof: for she did not fail to draw water for
so many camells as Eliezer brought (...) him, which would require much water*
O! Tr^ the Obediences that are performed in an (...) man are not acceptable.
There are some who obey, (...) it is with so much lazines and so frovvarde a
contenance, that they diminish very much the meritt of ^is virtue. Charity and
Obedience have such vnio^ ^^gether, that rhey cannot be separated. Love mak^h
us to obey readily; For how difficult soever the ^ing be that is commanded,
he who has amorous ^bedience, undertakes it lovingly: for Obedience ^^ing a
principal part of humilitye, which excee^^ngly loves submission,
consequently a sister ^uelie Obedient loves the commandment: and ^erceauing
it a far of, whatsoever it may be, ^hether it may be according to her gust
or not, she ^^braceth it, houldeth it dear, and cherishes it te^^erlie. There
is in the life of Saint Pachome, an ^^ample of this promptitude of Obedience,
that I ^ill tell you: Amongst the Religious of Saint Pa^^ome, there was one
called Jonas, a man of great ^ertue, and sa^ctitie, who had the charge of the
garden, ^herein he had a figg Tree, that did be are very ^yre figgs. Now this
figg Tree did serve for a te^tatio^ to the young Religious, for every time
they ^assed near unto it, they always cast their eyes on ^^e figs. Saint
Pachome having noted it, walking ^^e day through the garden, looking toward
^^e figg Tree, savve the devil on the topp, who ^evved the figgs from the
topp to the bottom, as ^^e Religious did from the bottom to the topp. ^his
great Saint who did no less desire to direct is Religious to a total
mortification of their ^nces, then to the interior mortification of their
^assions and inclinations, called Jonas, and com^aunded him, that the next
morning he should ^ot fail to cut down the figg Tree, vvhereto ^^e good
man replied, Ah; My Father, these ^oung people must be a little supported,
they ^ust be recreated in some thing, it is not for ^ee that I desire to keep
it. VVhereto the Fa^^er answered very svveetlie; My Brother, you vvil not
obey simply and readilye; what will yo^ say, that the tree shall be more
obedient then you the which happened: for the next morning they fou^^ the Tree
dry and without sap, and never bare mo^ fruit. The Good Jonas did say very
truly, that (...) was not for himse^fe that he would keep the Tree, for
they noted, that from 75. years that h^ had lived in Re^^gion, and was
gardener, he neue^ had tasted any fruit of his garden, but he was very
liberal to his Brethren; but heerby he learned ho^ commendable prompt
obedience was. Our Lord has given us continual examples all the time o^ his
life, of this promptitude in Obedience; for the^^ could not be any thing found
so pliable and pro^p^ as he was to the will of every one, and accordin^ to
his example we must earne to be very pro^p^ in Obedience; For it suffices
nor the amorous ha^^ to do that is commanded, or that which other make show
to desire of him: if he do it not pro^ptlie, he cannot see the hour come
soon enoug^ for to accomplish what is ordained, to the end the^ may of new
command him some other thing David did but only desire to drink of the
Cestern^ of Bethleem, and instantly three valiant Warriors departed inclining
themselves, and crosse^ through the army of the enemies to get it for him*
They wear exceeding ready to follovv the desir^ of the king: eue^ so we see
that innumerable saint^ have done to follow, as it appeared to them, the
inclinations and desires that the king of kings ou^ Lord JESUS had. VVat
commandment I beseech you did our Lord make, that might oblige Sainct^
Katherin of Sie^na, to drink or lick with her toug^ the filth which came
forth of the wound, of tha^ poor woman whom she did serve? and Lewi^ king of
France to eat with the leapers, to encourage them to eat? certaynelie they
weere not any ways obliged to this, but knowing our Lord did ^^ue it, and had
demonstrated his inclination to the ^^ue of our proper abiectio^; they thought
in doing (...) such things to gratify him, by following his in^^nation, with
very great love, (a^lthough it weere ^rie repugnant to their sense). We are
obliged to ^^pe our neighbor when he is in extreme neces^ie: nevertheless
because alms is a coun^ell of ^^r Lord, many willingly give alms, as much as
^^eir means will permit them. Now upon this ^bedience to the counsels
amorouse Obedience ^^grafted, which makes us enterprise to follovv ^^ecisely
every point of the desires, and intentions (...) God, and our superiors.

. 5. But I must advertise you here, of one de^ate, into which we may fall.
For if those that ^ould undertake the practice of this virtue very ^^actlie,
would always keep themselves atten^^ue, thereby to know the desires and
inclinations (...) their Superiors, or God, they should loose their ^^me
infallibly; as for example, vvhilest I should ^^quire what is the desire of
God: I should not ^^ifie my self in keeping my repose and tranquillity (...)
being near him, which is the desire he has ^ow, since he has not given me
any other thing (...) do: even as he who to follow the inclination, ^at our
Lord has manifested of succouring the ^oore, would go from town to town to
seek ^^em, who knovveth not that whiles he is in one, ^ee shall not serve
those that are in another? I ^ust go to this business in simplicity of heart,
gi^ing my alms when I shall meet with the occa^on, and not go musing
through the streats, from ^ouse to house, to enquire, if there be any poor
^^at I know not of: likewise when I perceive the ^^periour desires
something of me, I must yeald ^^y self ready to do it, not sifting up and
down, if I may be able to know that she has some i^clinatio^ that I do
some other thing for this wou^^ take away the peace and tranquillity of ha^^
which is the principal fruit of Loving Obed^ence.

. 6. The third condition of Obedience is pers^uerance. Now our Lord has taught
us this v^rye particularlye; as saint Paul declares in the terms; He has
been made Obedient until dea^ and magnifying this Obedience unto death, the
death of the cross says he: In these words, until death, is presupposed,
that he had been Obedient all the days of his life: during the which the^
was no other thing seen then the traces of Obedience yealded by him, asvvell
to his parents, as t^ many others, yea likewise to the wicked an^ impious;
and as he did begin by this virtue he^ did likewise end therevvith the course
of th^^ morta^l life. The good Religious man Iona^ has furnished us with two
examples about thi^ subject of perseverance, and allthough he did no^ so
promptlye obey the commandment that Saint Pachome gave him, he was
notvvitstanding ^ Religious of great perfection, for from the tim^ that he
entered into Religion until his death, he^ continued in the Office of gardener
vvithou^ ever changing it, during Sixty five years tha^ he lived in that
Monastery; and the other exercise, wherein he did persevere all his life
tim^ (as I have before said) was to make* matts o^ bu^ruhes, interlaced with
leaves of Palms; so that he dyed making of them. This is very great virtue
to persevere so long in such an exercise* for to do a thing joyfully that is
commanded for one time, as often as they will* this costs no^ thing: But
when one shall say to you* you shall always do this, all the time of your
life; here ^is where virtue shines or vvherin the diffi^^ltie lies.
Consider then what I have said to ^^u touching Obedience, but yett one word
^ore. Obedience is of so great vvorth, that she (...) companion to Charity,
and these two virtues (...) those that give the prize and vvorth to all the
^hers; in such sort that without them, all the ^hers are nothing: if you have
not these two ^^rtues, you have no virtue at all: if you have these, ^u have
with them all the other virtues.

. 7. But let us pass further, and leaving apart ^^e general Obedience to the
commaundments of ^od, let us speak of Religious Obedience. I say ^en if the
Religious obey not: they shall never ^^ue any virtue; For it is Obedience
principally ^t makes us Religious, as being the proper and ^culier virtue of
Religion: yea, even to have the ^^sire of martyrdom for the love of God is
no^ing, if you have not Obedience. We read ^ the life of Saint Pachome, that
one of his Reli^ous, (who all the time of his Nouitiat had per^^ered in
exemplar submission and humility) ca^^ to Saint Pachome transported with
great fer^^ur, and said to him; that he had a very ^^at desire of
martyrdom, and that he should ^uer be sattiffyed until he did attain it;
and ^sought him very humbly, that he would pray ^ God that it might be
accomplished. The ^oly Father endeauored to moderate this fervor; ^t the more
that he did say, the more hott the ^^her was in the pursuit of his desire:
The Saint ^^ed to him; My son, it is more worth to ^^e in Obedience, and to
dye every day living, ^ a continual mortification of a man's ^ self, (...) to
mart^^ our selves in our imagination: He ^^th a good Mart^^ who mortifieth
himself well; it is a greater martyrdom to persevere a^ ma^s life in
Obedience, then to dye with one str^^ of a svvorde. Live in peace, My son,
and qu^ your spirit, diuerting it from this desire. The Re^^gious who assured
himself that his desire procee^ed from the Holy Ghost, abated nothing at all
his he at, continually soliciting the Father that (...) would pray, that his
desire might be fulfill* After some short time, they had nevves proper^^ his
consolation; For a certain Saracene a capta^^ of thieves, came to a Mountain
near to the M^nasterie: whereupon Saint Pachome called ^ Monk to him, and
said to him, well my so^^ the hour is come that you have so much desir^ go
in good time to cut vvood in the mountay^ The Religious being wholly
replenished with ^ went his way chanting and singing psalms to ^ praise of
God, and giving thanks unto him, ^ he had vouchsafed to do him the honor,
a^ give him this occasion to die for his love* in f^ he thought of nothing
less, then that the succ^ would fall out as it did. Now behold so soon
those thieves had perceived him, they came ^ wards him, and began to lay
hold of him and threaten him; for a while he was very vali^^ Thou art dead,
said they; I demand no other the said he then to dye for God, and the like
an^wers. The Sarace^s led him to the place where t^^ Idol was, to make him
adore it; when they sa^ that he did constantly refuse it, they began to ^
themselves upon him to kill him. Alas; this po^ Religious man, so valiant in
his own imaginati^^ seeing the blade at his throat; Ah, of pity said ^ do
not kill me, I will do all that you desire me, I am yet young take pity
on me, it would ^ a great loss to shorte^ my days. In fine, he ad^^ their
Idol, and these miscreants mocking ^ beating him soundlye, left him to
return to his ^onasterie. Where being arrived more dead then ^^ue, all pale
and gastlie, Saint Pachome, who was ^ne forth to meet him, said to him:
well my ^^nne, how goes it, and and who is he that has ^us used you? Then
the poor Religious ashamed ^^d confused in himself, because he had had so
^eat Pride, was not able to support himself. ^^ing he had committed so
heinous a crime, but ^^ting himself before the Father confessed it, whom the
Father readilye did help, causing the ^^ethren to pray for him, and making him
ask par^^n of God, putt him in good estate, and then gave ^^m good
aduertisments, saying: My son, remem^^^ thy self, that it is more vvorth to
have good ^^sires to live according to the community, and to ^^ue no other
will, then fidelity in observance of ^ Rules, not enterprising, nor desiring
any other ^^ng, then that which is contained in them. then have great desires
to put in execution imaginary ^eruailes, which are good for no other thing,
then ^ make our hearts swell with pride, and to cause ^ to despise others,
esteeming our selves better the^ ^^ey. O how good it is to live under the
shelter of ^oly Obedience, rather then to retire our selves ^t of her arms, to
seek for that which seems ^ore perfect unto us: if thou would have been
^nte^t to do as I advised thee, to mortify thy self ^^ing, then thou
would have desired nothing ^^se then death, and should not have fallen
as now ^ou have done: but be of good courage, and re^ember henceforth to live
in submission, and as^e thy self that God has pardoned thee. He ^eyed the
council of the saint, comporting him^^^e with much more humility all the
time of his ^.

. 8. I say yet furthermore, that Obedience is of no less meritt the^ Charity;
for to give a cupp ^ water for Charity is vvorth the kindome of hea^ our Lord
himself has said it; doing so much f^ Obedience you will gain the same:
The ver^ least thing done for Obedience is most acceptab^^ to God: eat for
Obedience, your eating is mo^^ pleasing to God; then the fasts of Anchoritts,
if the be done without Obedience; if you rest by Obed^ence, your repose is
much more meritorious, a^ acceptable to God, then voluntary labor: but y^
will say to me, what profitt shall come to me f^ practiceing this loving
Obedience so exactly vv^ the foresayed conditions; blindlie, promptlye, a^
perseuerantlie? O my dear Daughthers! the person that will perform it, shall
enjoy in his so^ continual tranquillitye, and the most holy pea^ of our Lord
which surpasses all vnderstandi^^ He shril have no account to render of his
actio^ since they have all been exercised by Obedien^ as well touching the
Rules, as the Superiors w^ happiness more profitable and desirable then the
Certaynely the true Obedient (speaking this by t^ way) loves her Rules,
honors the^, and esteem them dearly; as the true way wherein he oug^ to
walk to the union of his spirit with God: T^^refore he never departs from
this way, nor f^ the observance of those things that are appoint^ therein in
form of direction, no more then from those that are there commanded.

The soul truly Obedient shall live as svvet^ and peaceably as a child who
is in the arms of dear mother, who troubles not himself vv^ that which
may happen: whether the Mother c^rie him on the right hand, or on the left, he
tak^ no care; even so the true Obedient, let them command him this, or that,
he troubles not himse^^ provided that they command him, and hee^ always
between the arms of Obedience (I would ^ay in the exercise of Obedience) his
content. Now to such a one, I may very well assure on the art of God the
Paradise of eternal life; as also dure^^g the course of this mortal life he
shall enjoy ^ue tranquillity, for it cannot be doubted.

. 9. Now you demand, if you be obliged ^n pain of sin to do all that the
Superiors tell ^ou; you must do as when you render account; if ^ou must hold
for a commandment all that the ^uperiour has said to you, which is proper
for ^our advancement; O no, my Daughter, Superiors ^o more then confessors
have not intention all^aies to oblige the inferiors by the commandments they
make, and when they will do it, they ^e that word of commandment, upon
pain ^f disobedience, and then the inferiors are obliged ^ obey under pain
of sin, allthough the com^aundement were very light, and the thing but
^tle: but otherwise not: for they give advise in ^ree sorts, some by form of
commandment, others by way of council, and others by way of ^mple
direction: In the Co^stitutions and Rules it is ^en the very same, for their
are articles that say: ^he sisters may do such a thing: and others that ^ye,
they shall do itt, or take heed they do it not: ^me of these are counsels,
and others commaun^^ments, those who would not subject themselves ^ the
counsels and direction, they should trans^^esse against loving Obedience, and
this should ^ittnesse in them great remissness of heart, and ^f having very
little of the of God: to do but ^nelie that which is commanded, and no more:
^d allthough they do not transgress the Obedi^^ce that they have vowed,
which are those of co^^aundements, and counsels when they are not ^biect
unto direction, nevertheless they trangresse loving Obedience, which all the
Religious of the Visitation ought to pretend and practice.

. 10. You ask me if a person might not very well think, when they change
your Superiou^ that she is not so capable, as the other you have ha^ and that
she has not so much knowledge of t^^ way, whereby she ought to guide you,
Certain we are not able to hinder our thoughts; but to r^solue or abide in
the^, this is that which we oug^^ not to do; For if Balaam was so well
instruct^^ by an ass, with much more reason ought we believe, that God,
who has given us this Superio^^ will cause her to teach us according to his
will, ^ though it may be not according to our will. O^ Lord has promised
that the true obedient pers^ shall never err. No truly, the person who ve^
follovv indistinctlye the will and direction of t^ Superiors whom God shall
establish over him, ^ though the Superiors were never so ignora^ and did
lead their inferiors according to the ignorance, yea through rugged and
dangerous wa^ the inferiors submitting themselves, to all that is ^
manifestly sin, nor against the commaundem^ of God, and the Holy church, I
can assure you ^ they shall never err. The true obedient pers^ says the
holy scripture, shall speak of victor^ that is to say, he shall become
victorious, in difficulties through which he shall be carried Obedience, and
shall come forth of the vva^ through which he did enter by Obedience, w^
honor, how dangerous soever they may be should be a pretty kind of
Obedience, if ^ would not obey, but those Superiors who sho^ be pleasing to
us: If this day you have a Superi^^ of great esteem, asvvell for her
quallitie, as for virtues, you willingly obey with a good heart* morrow you
shall have another, who will not (...) much esteemed, and you do not obey her
with so ^ood a heart as the other, yealding her the like Obe^ience, not
esteeming so much, that which she ^^yeth to you, nor performing your duty
with ^^at satisfaction. Ah! who sees not, that you did ^bey the other out of
your inclinations and not ^urelie for God: for if it were so, you should have ^
much pleasure, and make as great esteem, of ^at which this tells you, as
you did of that which the other did say. I have often used to speak ^ne
thing, that is good always to be spoken of: because it ought always to
be observed, to wit: that all our actions ought to be practiced accor^ing
to the superior part: for it is so that we must ^ue in this house, and not
according to our senses, ^^d inclinatio^s. VVhithout doubt I shall have more
^^ttisfactio^, touching the inferior part of my soul ^ do that which one
superior to whom I have ^n inclination, shall command me; then to do that
another bids me, to whom I have it not: but ^ I do obey equally
touching the superior part, suffices, and my Obedience is vvorth more, when
have less content in doing it, for herein we ^hevve it is for God, and not
for our pleasure that ^ee do obey: There is nothing more common in ^e world,
then in this manner to obey those we ^ue: but for the other, it is exceeding
rare, and not ^racticed but in Religion. But it may be you will ^y, Is it not
permitted to disapproue that which ^is Superior does, nor to speak, or
consider therefore she makes these ordinances, which the ^ther did not? O
truly no, never my dear daugh^ers, so that it be not manifestly against the
com^aundements of God: for then we must neither ^bey nor approuue it: but in
whatsoever else, the ^nferiours ought allwaies to make their proper ^^dgme^t
to believe and confess, that the Superiors do very well, and that they have
good reason do it: she that should do otherwise, should n^ her self
Superior, and the Superior her inferio^ sinces he makes herself examiner
of her cau^ No, we must bow our shoulders under the b^ then of holy
obedience, believing that both the Superiors have had good reason to make the
^^maundements they have done, although differe^^ and contrary the one to the
other.

. 11. But shall it not be lavvefull for one t^ has allreadie lived long in
Religion, and who h^ done great services therein; to withdraw hers^ a little
from obedience, at least in some small ^^ter? O good God! what should this be,
but to ^ as a Master Pilot, who having brought his ba^ to the haue^, after
he had long and painfully labou^ to save it from the rageing waves of the
sea, would the end, being arrived in the haue^, break his shi^ and cast
himself into the sea; should not one in^^ rightly that he were a fool? For
if he had te^ded this he needed not to have labored so m^ to have brought his
barque within the haven.

The Religious man who has begun, has ^ done all, if he do not persevere
unto the end, must not say, that it appertains but to Nouices be so exact;
although that we see ordinarili^ all Religions, the nouices very exact and
mortifi^ It is not that they be more obliged then the P^^fessed; O no; for
they are not obliged as yet a thing at all; but they persevere in obedience,
for attain the grace of Profession. But the Professed obliged thereunto in
virtue of the vows they h^ made, which having done, it is not sufficient to ^
Religious, if they observe them not. The Religi^^ who thinks she may be
remiss in any the after her Profession, yea after she has lived a l^ time in
Religion, deceaueth her self exceeding ^r Lord shevved himself much more
exact in death, then in his infancye, permitting himself ^ee handled, and used
as I have said, and this is ^ugh of obedience, for to win your affection
^revnto.

12. It rests only to speak a word touching question was made to me
yesterday in the eue^^^ to wit, if it be lavvfull for the sisters to tell ^
an other, that they have been mortified by the ^eriour, or Maistresse of
Nouices upon any oc^^on? I aunsvvere, this may be spoken of, in three ^es; The
first is, that a sister may say: good God! ^r, our Mother knows very well
how to more me; being very glad, because she has been ^rthy of this
mortification, and because the Supe^^^r by this means has caused some little
gain ^er soul; saying she had good reason so to do, ^ not to spare me.
Thereby imparting her con^ to her sister, to the end that she assist her to
^ake God: The second manner in which one ^ speak; is to disburde^ her self;
finding the mor^atio^ or correction to be very heavy, she goes ^ischarge it
upon her sister to whom she impar^ it, who bemoaning her, litghtneth in some
sort trouble: and this manner is not altogether so sup^^able as the first,
because they co^mitt an imperfe^^ to compain: but the third should be
absolute^^ ^aught, to wit, to speak by way of murmu^o^ and dispite, and to
make it known that the Su^^^^our has done wrong. Now, as for this kind, I we
very well they do it not in this house by grace of God: of the first kind
although it be ^ evil to speak, it should be notvvitstanding ^e good not to
speak, but rather to exercise ^n selves internallie and rejoice with God. In
second manner truly it must not be done, ^y means of our complaining, we
loose the meritt of mortifcation. Do you know wh^ must be done, when we are
corrected and mort^fied? we must take this mortification as an appl^ of love,
and hide it in our heart, kissing it and cher^shing it the most tenderlye that
is possible for ^ Furthermore, to say, I come from speaking vvi^ our mother,
and I am as dry as I was before; I s^ there is no other course but to adhere
to God: F^ my part I receive not any consolation from cre^tures, I have been
less comforted then I was; the is not to the purpose. The sister to whom s^
speaks this, should aunsvvere very gently: ^ dear sister, if you were so
well united to God, you say you must be, before you go to speak t^ our
mother, then you would not have any disco^tent, because she has not comforted
you. But ^ the sense you speak of, that one must endeavor ^ unite herse^fe to
God, take heed that in seeki^^ God when creatures fail, he permit not
himse^^ so to be found: For he vvil be fought before ^ things, and in the
contempt of all things; Becau^^ creatures do not content me, I will seek
the cre^tor; O no, The Creator does deserve that I forsa^^ all for him, even as
his will is, that we should do* Therefore when we depart from the
Superio^^ full of ariditye, not having received one on^ dropp of consolation,
of necessity we must be^ our ariditie and dryness as a precious balm, man
of the affections that wee^ have received in ho^ prayer, as balm, I say; and
let us be very caref^ not to spill any part of this precious liquor, whi^
has been sent us from heaven as a noble gift, to ^ end we may perfume our
heart, with the depri^^tion of consolation, which we thought to me^ with, in
the words of the Superior. But there a thing to be noted upon this
subject; which this, diverse times you carry a dry and hard ha^ when you go
to speak to your Superior, which ^nnot be capable to be watered, or
moistened ^ith the water of consolation, for so much as it is ^ot susceptible,
nor able to receive what the Supe^^our says: and although she speak very
well according to your necessity: notvvitstanding it see^^eth not so to you.
At another time when you shall ^aue a tender and well disposed heart, she shall
not ^^eake above three or four words, much less pro^^table for your
perfection, then the other were, ^ut shall comfort you: and wherefore?
because ^our heart was disposed for it. It seems to you ^^at Superiors have
consolation upon the top of ^^eir lips, and that they can power it forth
easilye ^^to the hearts of whom they please which neuer^^elesse is not so: for
they cannot always be of ^ne humor, no more then others: happy is that
^erson that can keep equallitie of heart, in the thro^g ^f all this inequallity
of successes: one while we ^halbe comforted, a little time after we shall
have dry heart, in such sort that it will cost us extreme care to produce a word
of comfort.

. 13. Further you demanded of me, what ^ had to say to you touching some
exercise proper ^o kill self judgment; to which I aunsvvere, that it ^ best,
faithfully to abridge it from all sorts of dis^ourse, wherein it will become
master, making it ^o know that it is but the servant. For, my dear
Daughters, it is by reiterared acts that we gain ^ertues; allthough there
have been some souls, to ^vhom God has given them all in an instant.
Therefor when you find in your self a suggestion to judge, whether a thing
be well or ill ordained, ^utt of the discourse of your own judgment: and a
^ttle after when one shall say to you, that such a thing must be done in such
a manner, do not stu^ye to discourse or discern, if it would be better
otherwise: but make your proper judgment to be confident, that it could never
be done, then in the manner that they have told you. If they appoin^ you any
exercise, permit not your judgment t^ discern, whether it be proper for you,
or not; an^ be wary, for although you do the thing, eue^ as it is
commanded, proper judgment very often obeys not, I would say, submiteth
not it self For it approves not of the commandment, the which is
ordinarily the cause of the repugnance^ that we have, to submitt our selves
to do th^^ which is desired of us, because the vnderstandin^ and the judgment
represent to the will, that thi^ ought not to be so, or, that other means
must be used, to do that which they ordained, then thos^ that are appointed
us, and she cannot submitt he^ self, for so much as she always makes mo^^
account of the reasons, that proper judgment sh^vveth her, then of any other;
For every one b^leeueth his own judgment is the best, I neue^ met with any
who did not esteem his judgment, but two, who did confess to me, that
they ha^ not any judgment: and the one coming to me^ at a time, said: Sir, I
pray you speak some wha^ to me of such a matter, for I have not iudgmen^
enough to comprehend it; This did astonish me^ very much. We have in our age
a very remarkable example, of the mortification of prope^ judgment in a great
doctor, a man of great renown, who composed a book that he entitled Of
Dispensations and commandment, the which book falling into the hands of the
Pope^ he judged that it contained some erroneous propositio^s; and did write
to this Doctor, that he should raze the^ out of his book. This Doctor
receiving the commandment, submitted his judgment so absolutely, that he
would not clear, nor explain hi^ work, to justify himself, but
contrariwise be^ed he had done amiss, and that he was de^^ed by his own
judgment, and going up into a ^pitt, he read alovvde the letter that the Pope
^ written, took the book and rent it in pieces, ^ng with a lovvde voice,
that the Pope in iudg^ this fact, had judged very well, and that he did ^roue
with all his heart the Censure, and Fatherly ^rection that he had vouchsafed to
give him, as ^ng most just and svveete to him, who did deserve be rigorously
punished, and that he was ^^ch astonished that he had been so blinded, as to
^ deceived by his own judgment, in a thing so ^^nifestly wicked. He was in
noe sort obliged to ^ this, beeause the Pope did not command it; but ^ly that
he should raze out of his book cer^e things that did not seem good: For
(which ^erie remarkable) it was not heretical, nor so ^^nifestly erroneus,
that it might not be defended. ^e gave testimony of great virtue in this
occasion, ^ an admirable mortification of proper iudg^^nt. We mortify very
often our senses, be^fe self-will intrudeth it self to mortify the^; and
^ould be a shameful thing to show ones self ^borne in obedienee: what would
they say of us? ^ in proper judgment, very rarely, are any found ^ell
mortified. For to approve that which is com^^unded, to be good, to love and
esteem it as a ^ng which is good and profitable for us above all ^er things; O
this is that wherein Judgment is found ^kward and stubborn. For there are many
who ^ I will willingly do that you desire; but I see ^ll it would be better
otherwise. Alas! what do ^u, if you nourish your judgment in this manner?
^^thout doubt it will make you dru^ke: for there is no ^fere^ce between a
drunke^ person, and he who is ^ of his own judgment. David one day being in
the country which his soldiers wearyed, and tired ^ with famine, not having
any thing leaft vvhereto eat, he sent to the husband of Abigaill for
^ctualls: by ill happ this poor man was drunk, a^ talking like a drunkard
said; David after he h^ eatten up all his robberies, has sent to m^ house
ruin it as he has done other places. And so wo^ not give him any thing. Live
God, said David will repaye the not acknovvledgment, of the go^ that I have
done to this man in saving his flock and not permitting that any thing of his
should ^^rish, nor any harm befall him. Abigaill vnd^^standing the design of
David, the next morn^ went to meet him, with presents to appease hi^ using
these terms: My Lord what will you ^ to a fool? yesterday my husband was
drunk, ^ spoke wickeldlye, but he spoke in drink and a fool; Sir let your
anger be appeased, and lay ^ your hands upon him; For you will be sorry, to na^
laid your hands upon a fool. The same exc^ may be made of our judgment, as
of a drunke^ p^^son; for the one is no more capable of reason t^ the other.
We must therefore have a very gr^ care to hinder the making of these
consideration to the end we be not drunk with the reasons proper judgment,
principally in that which concerns obedience.

In fine you desire to know, if you oug^ to have a great confidence, and care
to aduert^ one an other in charity, of your defects. Y^^ without doubt, my
Daughter, this must be do^ for to what purpose do you see a defect in y^^
sister if you endeavor not to take it away by ^ means of an aduertisment;
Nevertheless you m^ be discreet in this business, for it will be no ti^ to
advertise a sister, vvhiles you see her indispos^ or troubled with
melancholy: for if you mak^ the^, she will be in danger to reject the
aduertisme^t, the first onsett. You must expect a while, and ^en advertise her
in confidence and Charity. If sister speak words to you, that savor of
mur^uration, and that otherwise she have her heart ^uiet, without doubt you
may say unto her con^^dentlye, verily sister this is not well done; but ^ you
perceive she has some passion moved in ^er heart; then the discourse must be
changed the ^ost dexterousl^ that you can. You say you fear ^ aduer^ise a
Sister so often of the faults that she ^ath committed, because it will take
from her as^^rance, and make her sooner fail, through ^rce of fear: O God!
we must not judge thus ^f the Sisters here enclosed; for this appertay^eth
not to any other then to the maidens of the ^orld, to loose assurance when
they are aduer^^sed of their faults: Our Sisters do love their ^vvne abiection
too much to do so, although they ^e troubled: but on the contrary they will
take ^reater courage, and more care to amend them^^lues, not to avoyde the
aduertisments (for I ^ppose they do exceedinglye love all that which ^ay make
them become vile and abject in their ^wne eyes) but to the end, they may better
per^^rme their duty, and yeald themselves more con^^rmable to their vocation.

THE TWELFTH ENTERTAINMENT.
OF SIMPLICITY AND RELIGIOUS Prudence.
. 1. THe virtue whereof we are now to treat, i^ so necessary, that allthough
I have oftentimes spoken thereof, notwithstanding, you hau^ desired, that I
make an entire discourse of the fame Now in the first place must be made
knovvn^ what this virtue of Simplicity is. You know that commonly we call
a thing simple, when it is no^ imbrodered, pleated, or of many coullours: For
example, we say, behold a person that is simply apparelled, because he has
no lineing in his garment I mean his habitt is but of one stuff: and this is
^ simple garment. Simplicity therefore is no other thing, then a pure and
simple act of Charity, which has but one only end, which is, to attain to
the love of God. And our soul is then simple, when we have no other
pretension in all whatsoeue^ we do. The famous history of the hostesses o^
our Lord, Martha, and Magdalene, is very remark^able for this subject: For do
you not see tha^ Martha, although her end was laudable, to wit to entertayne
our Lord in the best manner: ye^ she was not free from being reprehended by
thi^ divine Master, for so much as besides the veri^ good end, that she had in
her ouer-busie care, she did yet behold our Lord in as much as he vva^ man,
and therefore she did believe he was ^ others, whom not one only meat; or
one manne^ of dressing, would suffice, and this was that vvhic^ caused her to
stir up and down so much, to ^repare many dishes: and so she doubled this
first and of the love of God in her exercise, with diverse ^ther
petty-pretenses, for which she was repre^e^ded of our Lord: Martha, Martha,
thou troublest any self with many things, allthough one only is ^ecessarie,
which is, this that Magdalene has chose^, and which shall not be taken from
her. Therefor this act of simple charity, which causes us not ^o regard, nor
have any other eye in all our actions ^hen the sole desire to please God, is
the part of Ma^^e, which is only necessary, and this is Simplicity, ^ virtue
which is inseparable with Charity; forso^uch as it looks right toward God:
neither ca^ it ^uffer any mixture of proper interest: for otherwise, ^ would
not be Simplicity; for she cannot suffer any doubling of creatures; nor any
consideration of them, God alone finds place in her. This virtue is ^urely
Christian. The Panymes, yea those who have ^iscoursed best of virtues had not
any knowledge ^hereof, no more then of Humility. For of Magni^ice^ce,
Liberallitie, and Constancye, they have writ^^ very well, but of Simplicity,
and Humility, nothing at all. Our Lord himself is descended from ^eauen to
give knowledge to me^, as well of the one, ^s of the other virtue, otherwise
this so necessary ^octrine had always been unknown. Be pru^e^t as
serpents, says he to his Apostles; but more^uer be as simple as Doves.
Learn of the Dove to ^oue God in simplicitye of heart, having but one only
pretense, and one only end in all that you shall do, but imitate not only
the simplicity of ^he love of Doves, in that they have always but ^ne mate,
for whom they do all, and vvho^ only ^hey will please, but imitate them also
in the simpli^^itye that they practice in the exercise and testimo^ie that they
yeald of their love, for they buesie not themselves with many things, nor many
love toys, but they make simply their little gronings and mournings about
their young ones, and content themselves with their company, when they are
present. Simplicity banisheth from the soul, the unprofitable care and
solicitude that many have to seek out diversity of exercises and means for
to be able to love God: so as they say, that if they do not all which the
sisters have done, in their opinion they know not how to be content. Poor
people they torment themseluss to find the art how to love God, and know
not, that it has no other point then to love him; they think there is a
certain subtillitie to attain this love, the which notvvithstanding is not
found but in simplicltye.

. 2. Now when we say, that there is not any art therein, it is not to
despise certain booke^ which are entitled: The art how to love God: For
these books teach that there is no other art then to set themselves to love:
that is to say, to put themselves into the practice of those things, that are
pleasing unto him, which is the only means to find and attain this sacred
love, provided that this practice be undertaken in simplicitye, without
trouble and solicitude. Simplicitye embraces truly the means, that are
prescribed to each one according to their vocation, for to attain to the love
of God, i^ such sort, that she will not have any other motive, to gain or to
be incited to the search of this love but the end it self: otherwise she
should not be^ perfectly simple; For she cannot endure any other aspect, how
perfect soever it may be, the^ the pure love of God which is her only
pretense. For example, if one go to the office, and you ask he^ whether go
you? I go to the office aunsvvereth she, but wherefore go you thither? I go
to prais^ God; but wherefore at this howe^ rather then at another? it is because
the clock has stricken, if I do not go I shall be noted; To go to the office
to praise God is very good; but the motive is not simple: For simplicitye
requires, that we go thereunto drawn with desire to please God without
any other respect, and the like is to be said in all other occasions. Now
before we pass further, a deceyt must he discovered, which is in the
spirit of diverse, touching this virtue; for they think that Simplicitye is
contrary to Prudence, and that they be opposite the one to the other; it is
not so, for virtues do never contradict the one the other; but have a very
great union together. The virtue of simplicity is opposite, and contrary to
the vice of craft and deceaite; a vice which is the source and spring from
whence proceeds policye, subtiltye and doubleness: Craft is a mass of
subtilties, deceytes, and threacheries; it is by the means of craft that we
find out inventions to deceive the spirit of our neighbor; and of those with
whom we have to do, for to lead to the point we aim at, which is to make
them understand, that we have no other meaning in our heart, then the same we
manifest by our words, nor any other knowledge of the subject whereof there
is question; a thing which is infinitely contrary to simplicitye, which
requires that we have the interior entirely conform to the exterior.

. 3. I intend not therefore to say that we must demonstrat our motions of
passions by the exterior, even as we have them in the interior; for it is
not against simplicitye to set a good countenance on the matter, so as they
may conceive nothing amiss. There must be allwaies made a difference between
the effects of the Superior part of our soul, and the effects of the
inferior part. It is true that by fitts we have great co^motions in the
interior of our soul, upon the encounter of a correction, or of some other
contradiction: but this commotio^ proceeds not from our will: but all this
sensible apprenhension passes in the inferior part, the superior part
consents not at all to this; but agrees, accepts, and finds this
encounter good* we have said, that Simplicitye has her continual aspect in
the purchaseing of the love of God; now the love of God requires of us; that
we restrain our feelings and fears, and that we mortify, and annihilate
the^; wherefore it does not require, that we should manifest the^ and make
the^ known to others; Therefore it is not want of Simplicie, to set a good
countenance on it, when we are moved in the interior; But should not this
deceive those who should see us, say you; for so much as although we should be
very unmortified, they would believe that we are very virtuous? This
reflectio^, my dear sister, upon what they will say, or what they will think
of you, is contrary to simplicity; for as we have said, she has no other
eye, then to co^te^t God, and not creatures, but only as the love of God
requires it. After that the simple soul has done an actio^ that she judges
is her duty to do, she thinks no more thereon, and if it comes into her
mind to think what they will say, or what they will think of her, she
pro^ptly cutteth of all this, because she cannot endure any stop or stay, to
diuerte her in her design, which is to keep her self attentive to her God,
to increase in her self his divine love; the consideration of creatures moves
not her for any thing, for she refers all to the Creator. The same is to be
said of that which one may say: whether it be not permitted to make use of
Prudence, for the not discovering to superiors, that which we shall think
may trouble the^, or our selves, in speaking of it: for Simplicity regards
only if it be expedient to speak, or do such a thing, and the^ she puts
her ^^lfe to the work, not loosing time to consider, if the ^^periour be
troubled, or my self. If I have declar^d some thought I have had of her; or if
she be not ^^oubled, nor I neither; if it be expedient for me to ^^eake it, I
will not omit simply to declare my ^inde; let it happen after as God will*
when I shall ^aue done my duty, I will not put my felfe to pain ^^r any other
thing: we must not allwaies fear ^ouble so much, whether it be for our
selves, or for another; for the trouble of ones self is not a sin; ^ I
know that goeing into some company, one will ^^eake some words that will
trouble and move ^ee, I ought not to avoid the goeing among the^; ^ut I ought
to carry my self armed with the con^^dence which I ought to have in the
divine prote^io^, that it will fortify me to overcome and van^ish my nature,
against which I will make war; ^ his trouble is not made but in the inferior
part ^f our soul, wherefore we must not be astoni^ed, when it is not obeyed;
I would say, when we ^e not consent to that, which it suggesteth to us: for
^at must not be done. But from whence comes ^^is trouble, but for want of
Simplicity; for so much ^ we muse oftentimes to think what one will (...),
and what one will think, in steed of thinking (...) God, and of that which man
make us more pleas^^g to his divine bounty and goodness; but if I ^eake such a
thing, I shall remain in more ^yne the^ I was before I spoke it: well, if you
will ^^t declare it, and that it be not necessary, having (...) need of
instruction in this act, resolve your ^fe readilye, and loose not the time to
consider, ^hether you ought to declare it, or not. For there (...) no reason to
make an hours consideration upon all the triffling actions of our life:
More^er I think in my opinion, that it is better and ^ore expedient to tell
our Superior the thoughts which mortify us most; the^ many others which seru^
for nothing, but for to prolong the discourse we have with her, and if you
remain in pain, it i^ nothing but immortification that causes it; for (...)
what purpose will I speak of that, which is no^ necessary for my profitt,
and omit that which may more mortify me. Simplicity, as we allreadi^
said, seeks nothing but the pure love of God the which is never found so
well, as in the mortification of our selves, and according to the measur^ that
mortification increases, so much the more near we approach unto the place
where we^ shall find his divine love. Moreover the Superiour^ ought to be
perfect, or at least they ought to do^ the works of the perfect: and
therefore they hau^ their ears open, for to receive and understand a^ that we
will say to them without putting themselves to much pain. Simplicitye
intermedlet^ not with what others do or will do. She thinks of her self,
yet not for her self does she think^ but what is truly necessary; for as
for other thing she allwaies speedily turns away her thought^ This virtue
has a great affinitye with humilitye which permits us not to have a worse
opinion of any, then of our selves.

. 4. You ask, how Simplicitye must be observed in co^uersations and
recreations? I answer you as in all other actions, although in this ther^ must
be had a holy freedom and liberty for to entertayne our selves with
discourse, which serve the spirit for matter of joy, and recreation. We mu^
be very real in conversation, yet we must no^ therefore be inconsiderate,
for so much as simplicitye allwaies follows the Rule of the love o^ God; but
it may happen that you shall speak some little thing, which may seem not to
be so vve^^ taken of all as you would desire: you must not for all this be
musing to make reflections upon a^ ^our words; No! For it is without all
doubt, selfe-^oue that causes us to make these inquiries, whether ^^at which
we have said or done be well taken; Holy simplicity runs not after her
words, nor ^er actions, but she leaves the eue^t of them to the ^iuine
providence, to the which she is souueraigne^^e united: she tourneth not het
self to the right ^and, or to the left: but follovveth simply on her ^ay: so
that if she encounter therein any occasion ^o practi^e some virtue, she serves
her self care^ully thereof, as of a means proper to attain to ^er
perfection, which is the love of God, but she ^resseth not her self too
earnestly to search them; neither does she contemn them; she troubles her
self with not^ing, s^e houldeth her self quiet and ^eacefull, in the
confidence she has, that God knows her desire which is ^o please him, and
this suf^iceth her. But how may we accord two things so ^ontrarie? you say on
the one side, that we must ^aue a great care of our perfection and
aduanceme^t, and on the other, you forbidd us to think thereon. Mark here,
if you please, the misery of humayne ^piritt; for it never stays, or rests
it self in a mediocritie; but it runs ordinarily into extremities; We
have this defect from our good mo^her Eve, for she did even as much, when the
wicked spirit did tempt her to eat of the forbidden fruit. God has
forbidden, said she, that we should touch it, in stead of saying he had
forbidden them to eat it. We do not say, that you may not think of your
aduanceme^t: but that you think not thereon with too much eagernes and trouble.

5. It is also want of simplicity that we make so many considerations, when
we see the faults one of another, to know whether such things are
necessary to acquaint the Superior withal, or no. For, tell me, is not the
Superior capable of this, and to judge whether it be requisite to correct it
or not; but what know I, for what intention this sister shall have done such a
thing, say you? it may very well be her intention is good: Therefore you
ought not to accuse her intention; but her exterior action, if there be any
imperfection: neither may you say. The matter is of small consequence, and not
worth the troubling of this poor sister; for all this is contrary to
Simplicitye. The Rule which commands to procure the amendment of the sisters
by the means of aduertisme^ts, commands us not to be so co^sideratiue in
this point: as if the honor of the sisters did depend upon this accusation;
Truly we must observe, and expect a convenient time to give correction: For
to do it sodaynelie, or passionatelie is somewhat daingerous: but this
excepted, we ought in simplicity to do that, which we are obliged to do
according to God, and that without scruple. For although it may be this person
is in passion, and troubled after the aduertisment, that you shall have given
her, you are not the cause of it, but her immortification. And if she committ
any fault upon the sudden, this will be the cause that she will avoid many
others, that she would have committed in perseuering in her defect. The
Superiors ought not to omit to correct the sisters because they have an
auersion to correction: for it may be so, that as long as we live we shall
allwaies have itt: For so much as, it is a thing totally contrary to the
nature of man, to be misesteemed and corrected; but this auersion ought not to
be favored of our will, the which ought to love humiliation.

. 6. You desire that I speak a word of the Simplicitye which we ought to
have, to leave our selves wholly to be guided according to the interior,
as well by God, as by our Superiors. There are souls which will not, as they
say, be guided but by the spirit of God, and it seems unto them, that all
things they imagine be inspirations, and motions of the holy Ghost, who takes
them by the hand, and leads the^ in all they desire to do, as children,
wherein truly they deceane themselves very much: For I pray you, was there
ever any had a more spetiall vocation then that of S. Paul, in which our Lord
himself did speak to convert him? and notwistanding he would not instruct
him, but he sent him to Ananias, saying: Go, thou shall find a man who will
tell thee what thou shall do? and although Saint Paul might have said,
Lord, and wherefore vvilt not thou thy self? notwitstanding he said not so,
but went very simply to do as he was commanded: and should we think our
selves to be more favored of God, then Saint Paul, believing that he will
guide us himself without the means of any creature. The guide of God, for us
(my dear children) is no other then Obedience, for, out of it there is nothing
but deceate. It is a very certain thing, that we are not all guided by one
and the self same way: yet it is not so, that each of us knovveth by which way
God calls us, this appertains to the Superiors, who have light from God
to do this* we must not say, that they do not know us well; For we ought
to believe that Obedience and submissio^ are allwaies the true marks of a good
inspiration, and although it may happen, that we have not any consolation in
the exercises that they appoint us to do, and that we have many in the
others, it is not by consolation that ^hey judge of the goodness of our actions;
Therefore we must not be tied to our proper satisfaction; for this should be
to cleave to the flovvers, and not to the fruit. You shall dravve mo^e profitt
from that which you shall do, fol^ovving the direction of your Superiors,
then you shall in following your interior instincts, which ordinarily do not
proceed but from selfe-^^ue, which under the color of good, seeks to ^ease
it self, in the vain esteem of our selves. It ^ a most certain truth, that
our good depends ^f leaving our selves to be conducted, and gouer^ed by the
spirit of God, with out any reservation, and this is that which the true
simplicity, that our lord has so much recommended, does pretend, ^ee simple
as Doves, said he, to his Apostles; He ^ayed not there, but added further
more, if you be^ome not simple as a little child, you shall not enter ^^to the
kingdom of my Father. A child, vvhiles ^ee is very little, is held in so
great simplicity, that ^ee has no other knowledge then of his mother, ^ath
but one only love, which is for his mother, and in this love one only
desire, which is the bo^ome of his mother, being placed in this welbelo^ed
breast, he desires no other thing. The soul ^vhich has perfect simplicity,
has but one love, which is for God: and in this love she has but one ^nely
pretense, which is to repose upon the breast ^f her celestial Father, and as
a child of love to make her aboade there, leaving entirely all the care ^f her
self to her good Father, never more trou^ling her self for any thing, but
still retayning this ^oly confidence, so that, neither the desires of ver^ues
and graces themselves do disquiet her; and in^eed wherefore serve the
importune and unquiet ^esires of virtues, the practice whereof is not
ne^essarie to us? gratiousnesse, mildness, love of our ^vvne abiection,
Humility, Sweet Charity, cordial freindshipe toward our neighbor, and
Obedience, are the virtues which we ought to practice most commonly, because
they are necessary for us, and the encounter of such occasions is frequent
with us; but for Constancy, Magnificence, and such other virtues, that it may
be we shall neue^ have occasion to practice, let us not trouble ou^ selves,
we shall not be for this the less Magn^nimous or generous.

. 7. You ask of me, how the souls, who i^ prayer are drawn to this holy
simplicity, and the perfect forsaking all in God, ought to guide them selves
in all their actions? I answer, that not onel^ in prayer, but in the conduct
of their whole lif^ they ought inuariably to walk in the spirit (...)
simplicity, and abnegation, remitting their vvho^^ soul, their actions and
successes to the good ple^sure of God, by a love of perfect and most absolu^^
confidence, leaving themselves to the mercy an^ care of the eternal love,
which the divine prou^dence has of them, and therefore they must hou^
themselves constant in this course, not permitti^ any alteration or reflection
about themselves, to (...) what they do, or whether they be satisfied; Ala^
Our satisfactions and consolations do not satis^ the eyes of God: but they
only content this mis^rable care, and love that we have of our selves, o^ of
God and his consideration. Certaynely the ch^^dren, which our Lord notes unto
us to be t^^ modle of our perfection, have not ordinarily a^^ care; above all
in the presence of their Fathers a^ Mothers, they keep themselves near to
them, n^^ther regarding their satisfactions, nor consolation which they take in
good part, and enjoy in simp^^citye, without any curiosity of considering t^
causes, or the effects, love so much employing the that they can do no other
thing. He who is ve^ attentive to please lovingly the celestial lover, h^^
neither heart nor leisure to reflect upon himself his spirit continually
tending thither where ^o^ carries it.

. 8. This exercise of the continual aband^ning of himself into the hands of
God, does exce^lently comprehend all the perfection of other exe^cises, its
most perfect puritye, and simplicity; an^ whiles God permits us to use it,
we ought n^ to change it. The spiritual lovers, spouses of the ^^lestiall
king, truly do view themselves, from tim^ to time as Doves, who are near
the most pure w^ters: to see if they be well accommodated to t^ liking of
their Lover, and this is performed in t^^ examens of their Conscience, whereby
they clean^^ purify, and adorn themselves, the best they man not for to be
perfect, nor to satisfye themselves; n^ for the desire of their progress in
well-doing, but ^ obey the spouse, for the reverence they bear vn^ him, and for
the exceeding desire they have to g^ue him contenteme^t: Is not this a very
pure Lo^^ unspotted, and very simple, since they do not p^rifie themselves to
be pure, they adorn not the^ selves to be fair, but only to please their
Lou^ to whom if deformity were as acceptable, the would love it as much as
beauty? And so the^ simple Doves do not imploye care or time, n^ any eagernes
to wash and trim themselves: F^^ the confidence that their Love gives them
of bei^^ much beloved, although unworthy (I say the Confidence that their Love
gives them, in the Lo^^ and bounty of their Lover) takes from them*
solicitude, and diffidence, of not being sufficient fair, and the desire to
Love, rather then to ador^ and prepare themselves to Love, cutteth of from them
all curious care, and makes them conte^ with a sweet and faithful
preparation, man Louinglye, and Cordiallye.

8. And to conclude this point, St. Francis sen^ing his Religious into the
world in a journey ga^ them this advise, in steed of monye, and for all the^
provision: Cast your care on our Lord, and he w^ feed you; I say the same to
you (my most dear ^aughters) cast all your pretensions, your solicitudes and
affections, within the fatherly breast of God, and he will guide you; nay
he will carrye you wheere his love will have you. Let us hear and ^mitate
our blessed Savior, who as a most perfect ^salmist singing the sovereign
sonnets of his love, ^ppon the tree of the cross, concludes them thus; My
Father, I commend and committ my spirit into ^y hands; having said this, (my
dear daughters) ^vhat remains but to expire, and to dye the death ^f love,
not living any more to our selves but ^ESVS CHRIST living in us? The^ shall
cease all the ^nquietnesse of our heart, which proceeds from the ^esire that
self love suggesteth, and from the ten^ernesse, that we have in and for our
selves; which ^auseth us secretly to be very busy in the search ^f the
satisfactions and perfections of our selves. and being imbarqued within the
exercise of our ^ocation under the vvinde of this simple and loue^ng
confidence, vvhithout perceauing our progress ^ee shall do very much, not
goeing we shall ^ett forvvard, and not moving from our place, we shall
dravve near our country, as those do who ^ayle on a full sea, under a
prosperous vvinde. Then ^re all the events and variety of accidents which
^appe^ received sweetly and mildlye; For he who ^s in the hands of God, and
reposeth within his ^reast, who is abandoned to his love, and committed to his
good pleasure, what is it, that may be ^ble to shake and move him?
Certaynelie in all oc^urrances, without studying like a Philosopher, ^ppon the
causes, reasons, and motives of events, ^ee pronounces from his heart, this
holy acceptatio^ and consent of our Lord: yeas, my father, for so it has been
pleasing in thy sight; Then we shall be ^all imbrued in sweetness and
mildness toward our sisters and neighbors; for we shall see these souls
within the breasts of our Savior; Alas! He^ that regards his neighbor out
of it, runs hazard to love him neither purelie, constantly, no^ equally;
But therein who would not love him who would not support him? who would
not suffer his imperfections? who would find any defec^ in him? who would
find him distasteful or burden^ some? Now this neighbor (my most dear
daughters) as he is within the breast of our savior, i^ there so well-beloved,
and so amiable, that the loue^ dyed for love of him. Furthermore the natural
love of consanguinitie, good countenances, vvelbe^ seemings, correspondences,
sympathies, and other graces shall then be purified, and reduced to the
perfect obedience of the most pure love of the good divine pleasure: and
truly the greatest goo^ and happiness of souls who aspire to perfection
should be, not to have any desire to be beloue^ of creatures, but by this
love of Charity, vvhic^ affectionateth us to our neighbor, and ^each o^^ in
their degree, according to the desire of o^^ Lord.

. 10. Before I end, I must speak a word (...) the prudence of the serpent;
for I have considere^ that if I did speak of the simplicity of the Dou^ you
would quickly object unto me the Serpen^ Many have demanded what serpent
it was (...) whom our Lord would have us learn Prudence: omitting all other
aunsvveres that may be^ made to this question we will now take the words
of our Lord: be Prudent as the serpen^ who, when he is taken, exposes all
his body t^ save his head; in like manner ought we to do^ exposeing all to
danger, when it is requisite for t^^ conserve our Lord and his love whole and
inti^^ within us: For he is our head, and we are h^^ members: and this is
the Prudence that we ought ^o have in our Simplicity. Furthermore you must
^emember, that there are two sorts of Prudence ^vherevvith we must be
furnished, to wit natu^all, and supernatural. Touching the natural, it must
be well mortified, as not being wholy ^ood, suggesting unto us many
considerations, and ^nnecessarie preuentions and foresights, which ^ould our
spiritts very far of from Simplici^ie.

The true virtue of Prude^nce ought indeed to ^ee practiced, for so much as it
is a spiritual salt, which gives taste and favor to all the other ver^ues:
But it ought so to be practiced by the Reli^ious of the Visitasion, that the
virtue of simple ^onfidence surpass all; for they ought to have an ^ntire
simple confidence, which may cause them to ^emayne in repose, betvveene the
arms of their ^elestiall Father, and their most dear mother ^ur Bl. Lady,
being before assured they will ^lvvaies protect them; with their most amia^le
care, since they are assembled for the glory of God, and the honor of the
most holy Virgin. God be blessed. Amen.

THE THIRTEENTH ENTERTAYNMENT.
OF THE RVLES AND SPIRIT of the Visitation.
. 1. It is a very difficult thing which you demau^^ of me, to wit what is
the spirit of you^ Rules, and how you may understand them; No^ before we
speak of this spirit: You must know^ what, it means to have the spirit of a
Rule; for we hear it ordinarily spoken, such a Religion has the true
spirit of his Rule. We will take o^ of the holy Gospel two examples, which
are ver^ proper for to make you comprehend this. It is said that St. Ihon
Baptist was come in the spirit a^ virtue of Elias, and therefore he did
reprehe^d si^ners bouldly and rigourously, calling them viper^ brood, and such
other words; But what was the virtue of Elias? It was the zeal which proceed^
of his spirit, for to annihilate and punish sinne^ making fire fall from
heaven to overthrow and ^ fund those who would resist the Majesty of ^
Master. This was then a spirit of rigor that Eli^ had. The other example
that we find in the Go^pell, which serves to our purpose is: That o^ Lord
desiering to go to Jerusalem, his discip^ dissuaded him from it, because some
had affecti^ to go into Carphanaum; and others into Betha^ and so they
endeavored to lead our Lord to ^ place whither they would go. It is noe new
thi^ to have inferiors guide their masters accordi^ to their will; But our
Lord, who was facill^ condescend, notwithstanding settled his ^ (for the
Evangelist uses the same words) go unto Jerusalem, to the end that the
Apostles should not press him further, not to go thither. Then goeing
toward Jerusalem, he desired to ^asse through a town of Samaria; but the
Sama^itans would not permit him; whervppon Saint ^ames and Saint Ihon being
in choler, were so ^ngry against the Samaritans, for the inhospital^tye showed
toward their Master, that they ^yed unto him: Master, vvilt thou that we
make ^ere fall from heaven to consume them and punish ^em for the outrage they
have done thee? And ^ur Lord answered them, you know not of that spirit
you are; as who would say, do you ^ot know, that we are no more in the
time of ^lias, who had a spirit of rigor, and although ^ee were a very
great servant of God, and did well ^ doing that which you would do,
notwithstan^^ng you should not do well to imitate him: For ^ much as I am not
come to punish and confound ^nners; but to draw them sweetlye to penance ^d to
follow me.

. 2. Now Let us see what the particular spi^t of a Rule is. The better to
understand this, exa^^es must be alleged of Religion in general; and
^erwardes we will return to our selves. All ^^ligions and all assemblyes of
devotion have ^e spirit, which is general, and each-one ^th one which is
his in particular. The general, ^ the pretense that they all have to aspire to
^ perfection of Charity; but the particular spi^t is the means to attain to
this perfection of ^^arity: that is to say, to the vnio^ of our soul with^d,
and with our neighbor for the love of God; ^ which is made with God, by the
union of our ^ll with his, and with our neighbor by meeke^se, which is a
virtue immediately depending charity. Let us now come to this particular
spirit: Truly it is very different in diverse order^ some unite themselves
to God and to their neighbor by Contemplation, and for this cause they have
very great solitude, and converse as little as may be with the world, no
not one with another but at certain times: They also unite themselue^ with
their neighbor, by the means of prayer, praying to God for him. On the
contrary the particular spirit of others is, truly to unite themselves to
God and their neighbor; but it is by the means of action although spiritual.
They unite themselves to God; but this is in reconcileing their neighbor unto
him, by study, preachings, Confessions, conferences, and other actions of
pietie^ and the better to perform this act toward their neighbor, they
converse with the world, allthough they unite themselves to God by prayer
yett notvvistanding their principal end is tha^ we speak of: to wit, to
endeavor to conuer souls, and unite them to God. Others have a seuer^ and
rigoerous spirit, with perfect contempt of the world, and of all its
vanities and sensualities, desireing to induce others by their example to
co^temn^ earthly things, and for this serve the asperities o^ their habitts
and exercises. Others have another spirit, and it is a very necessary thing
to knovv^ what is the peculier spirit of each Religion, an^ pious assembly.

. 3. For to know this well, we must consider the end wherefore it has
been begun, and the diverse means to attain to this end. There is a general
spirit in all-Religions, as we have sa^ed: bu^ it is the particular of which
I speak: and to which we must have so great a love, that there is not an^
thing which we may know that is conform t^ this end, that we would not
embrace with a^ our heart. Know you what it means, to lou^ the end of our
Institute? it is to be exact in the obseruanee of the means to attain to
this end, which are our Rules and Constitutions, and to be very diligent to
do all that belongs and helps to observe them the more perfectly: this is
to have the spirit of our Religion. But this exact and punctual observance
must be undertaken in simplicitye of ^hart, I would say we must not desire
to go beyond it, by pretenses to do more then is appointed us in our Rules;
For it is not by the multiplicitie of things that we do that we gain
perfection; but it is by the perfection and purity of intention with the
which we perform them. You must therefore regard what is the end of your
Institute, and the intention of your Institutour, and ^ettle your selves to the
means which are appoint^d you to attain thereunto. Touching the end of your
Institute, you must not search into the in^ention of the three first sisters
that began it, no more then the Iesuitts did into the first design that Saint
Ignatius had: for he thought nothing less ^hen to do that which he did
afterward; as likewise Saint Francis, Saint Dominicke and others, which
have begun Religious Orders. But God to whom it appertains to make such
assemblyes of piety, causes them to flourish, in this fashion that we see
they do, for we must not believe, that ^his is the work of men, who by
their invention ^aue begun this kind of life so perfect, as this of Religion
is, It is God by whose inspiration, Rules ^aue been composed, which are the
proper means ^o attain to this general end os all Religions, that ^s, to
unite themselves to God, and to their neigh^our for the love of God. But as
each Religion ^ath his peculier end, and also particular means to ^ttayne to
this end, and general union, so all have general means to attain thereunto,
which is by the three essentialle vows of Religion. Eueri^ one knows, that
riches and the goods of the earth, are powerful attracts, to dissipate the
soul, asvvell for the over great affection she has unto them, as for the
solicitudes she must have to keep^ them, yea to increase them; for so much as
man never has enough of them as he desires. A Religious person cutteth of
all this at once by the vow of poverty. And does the same to the flesh, and
to all his sensuallities, and pleasures, as well lawefull as unlawful, by the
vow o^ Charity. Which is a very great means to be united to God most
peculiarly; for so much a^ sensual pleasures do very much weaken, and
depresse the forces of the spirit, dissipate the har^ and the love we owe
to God, and hinder v^ from giving our selves entirely unto him: by this means
we do not content our selves to go out of the world, but furthermore vve^
go out of our selves, that is to say renouncing the terrestrial pleasure of
our flesh; But much more perfectly do we unite our selves to Go^ by the
vow of Obedience, for so much as vve^ renounce our whole soul, and all her
powers her wills, and all her affections, to submit^ and subject our selves,
not only to the will o^ God; but to that of our Superiors, which vve^ are
allwaies to regard, as the will of God himself. And this is a very great
renounciation, because of the continual productions of the little wills that
self love causes. Then being thus sequestered from all things, we do retire
into the intime o^ our hearts, to unite our selves the more perfectly to his
Divine Majesty.

. 4. Now to come in particular to the end for which our Congregation of the
Visitation hat^ been erected, and thereby to comprehend more easily what is
the spirit of the Visitation, I have ^waies judged that it was a spirit of a
profound ^imilitie toward God, and gentleness toward ^r neighbor: For so
much as having less ri^our for the body, there must be so much more ^eeknes
of heart. All the ancient Fathers have de^^rmined, that where corporal
mortifications, ^d austerities are vvanting, there they ought to ^ue more
perfection of spirit: Humility then ^vvards God, and mildnes toward your
nei^bour in your houses must supply the austeritie ^ others. And allthough
austerities are good in ^emselues, and are means to attain to perfe^ion, yet
they will not be so good in your house; ^ as much as this should be against
your Rules. ^he spirit of sweetness is so the spirit of the Vi^ation, that
whosoever would introduce more ^steritie therein then now there is, should
in^^ntinently destroy the Visitation: for this should ^e to do against the
end, for which it has been ^ected, which is to be able for to receive ^erein
infirm women and maidens, that have ^t sufficient strenght of body to
undertake i^, ^ which are not inspired and dravvn^ to vnitte ^emselues to God,
by the way of aus^erities which they use in other Religions. It may ^ee you
^ll say to me, if it happen that a sister has a ^ong complexion, may not she
use more auste^ties then others, with the permission of the Su^^riour, in such
sort that the other sisters do not ^rceaue it? I aunsvvere to this, there is
no secrett, ^at passes not secreatlie to another; and so from ^e to other,
they come to make Religions in Regions; and from little combinations, in the
end ^ is dissipated. The Bl. Mother S. Teresa foretold ^mirable well the hurt
which these little enterpri^s bring, of desiering to do more then the Rule
ordayneth, and which the community does no^ exercise, and particularly, if
it be the Superior, i^ will be greater. For even so soon as her Religious
shall perceive them, they will incontinently do the same; and they shall not
want reason, for to persuade themselves that they do well, some thrust
forwards with zeal, others to please the Superior, and all this will serve
for a tentation to those who cannot, or will not do the same.

. 5. We must never introduce, permit, no^ suffer these particularities in
Religion. Nevertheless excepting certain particular necessities, as i^ it
should happen, that a sister were oppresse^ with some great vexation, or
tentation, then i^ should not be an extraordinary for to ask of the
superior to do some penance more then others For we must use the same
simplicity that the sick^ do, who ought to ask the remedies; which they
think may comfort them: So that if you had a sister here, that were so
generous and courageous, a^ to have a will to attain perfection in a quarter
o^ an hour, doing more then the community, ^ would council her that she
should humble and submitt her self, and not have a desire to be perfect but
within three days, vvalking the train o^ others. And if we meet with
sisters who hau^ strong and able bodies, in good time be it, notvvithstanding
they must not desire to go fast then those that be vveake. Behold in Jacob
a^ example which is admirable, and very proper for to show unto us, how we
ought to accommodat^ our selves unto the vveake, and to stopp our force, to
subject our selves to go even with them, especially when we have obligation
thereunto as the Religious have to follovv the co^munitie, in all that i^ of
perfect observance. Jacob departing from the house of his Father-in-lavve
Laban, with all hi^ wives, children, servants, and flocks of catell to
^etourne into his own house, feared extremely ^o meet with his brother
Esau, for so much as he ^id think his brother was allwaies irritated against
^im, which was not so: being then in the way, ^oore Jacob was greatly
afraid, for he met Esau ^ery well accompayned, with a great troop of
^ouldiers. Jacob having saluted him, found him very ^entle toward him; for
he said to him, my bro^her, let us go in company, and end our journey
together; to whom holy Jacob answered, My lord and my brother, not so if you
please, for so ^uch as I lead my children, and their little pace should
exercise, or abuse your patience; but for me ^vho am obliged there unto, I
measure my pace to ^heirs, likewise my sheep have lately brought ^orth their
young lambs, who are yett tender, and ^ot able to go so swift, and those
occasions will ^ay you very much in the way. Mark I pray you ^he mild
beauiour of this holy Patriarcke. He ^ccommodated himself willingly not
only to ^e pace of his little children; but also to his ^ambes. He was on
foot, and this was a happy ^oiage to him, as is sufficiently known, by
the ^lessings which he received from God all the ^vaye long, for he savv and
spoke many times ^vith the Angels, and with the Lord of Angels and men; and
in fine he had a better part then his ^rother who was so well accompayned.
If we ^esire our voyages should be blessed of the divine ^oodnes, let us
submitt our selves willingly, to ^he exact and punctual observance of our
Rules, and that in simplicity of heart, not desireing to dou^le exercises,
which would be to contradict the ^ntention of the Institutour and the end for
which ^e Congregation has been erected. Let us then ^villinglie accommodate
our selves to the infirm, which may be received therein, and I assure you, we
shall not arrive to perfection the later for this; but on the contrary, this
vvil be a means to lead us thereunto the sooner, because not haueing much to
do, we shall apply our selves to perform our duty with the greatest
perfection that shall be possible for us. It is this wherein our works are
most pleaseing to God; for so much as he has not regard to the multiplicitie
of things which we do for his love: (as we have said even now) but to the
fervor of Charity wherewith we effect them. I find if I be not deceived,
that if we determine with our selves to observe our Rule perfectly, we shall
have business enough, without charging our selves with more, for so much as
all that which concerns the perfection of our estate is comprised therein.
The blessed mother Saint Teresa says that her Religious were so exact, that
it was expedient that the Superior had a very great care to speak of
nothing, but what was very fit to be do: because that without any other
bidding, they would set themselves to do it; and for to observe their Rules
more perfectly, they were punctual in the least little. She reports that
one time, there was one of her Religious, who having not well heard a Superior
command her, said to her, that she did not well understand what she said,
and the Superior answered her very rudely and inconsideratlye: Go put your
head into the well (said she to her) and you shall understand it. The
Religious was so ready to depart, that if they had not stayed her, she was
goeing to cast her self into a well. Truly there is less to be done to
be exact in the observance of the Rules, then to be willing to observe them
but in part.

. 6. I cannot sufficiently declare of what importance this point is, of being
punctual in the least ^^ing, which serves to observe the Rule more per^ectly,
as also of not desyreing to undertake any ^^ing more, under what pretext soever
it be. For so ^uch as this is the means to conserve Religion in ^er
integrity, and in her first fervor; and the contrary ^o this is that, which
destroys it, and makes it to all from her first perfection. You will ask of
me, there should be more perfection to conform ^nes self so to the
community, that even they should not ask to communicate extraordinary by?
^ho doubts it, my dear daughter? except it be ^ a certain case, as on the
Feast of our Patron, ^ Saint to whom we have had devotion all ^ur life, or
some urgent necessity. But touching ^ertayne petty-feruours that we have
sometimes, which are ordinarily the effect of our nature which ^useth us to
desire the holy Communion; we ^ust not have regard to this, no more then the
^ariners have to a certain wind, which rises ^ the break of day which is
produced of va^ours, that are exhaled from the earth, and conti^ueth not; but
cease so soon as the said va^ours ^re a little ascended and dispersed, and
there^^re the Master of the shipp who knows it, cal^^th not upon the
mariners, nor displaieth the sails ^ set forward in favor of it; likewise
we must ^ot esteemee* every wind for a good wind; that is ^ say, so many
petty motions or wills for inspira^ons; to wit now to ask to communicate,
by and by ^ pray, the^ some other thing, For self love which ^waies seeks
her satisfactions, would remain ^^tirelie content with all this, and
principally with ^^ese little inventions, and will not cease to furnish ^
always with new: this day when the commu^^tie does communicate, she will
suggest to us, ^at for humility you must ask to abstain, and when the time
of humbling our selves shall come, it will persuade us to rejoice, and to ask^
the holy Communion to this effect; and so we shall never have done. we
must not hold those thing which are out of the Rule for inspirations. if it
be^ not in extraordinary cases, which perseueranc^ makes us to know, that
it is the will of God, as i^ is sound touching the sacred Communion, in two or
three great Saints whose directours would have them daily to communicate. I
find this to be an act of very great perfection, to conform our selves in
all things to the community, and never to omit the practice thereof by our
own election For besides that this is a very good means to vnit^ us unto
our neighbor, it does hide moreoue^ from us our own perfection. There is a
certayn^ simplicity of heart, wherein consists the perfection of all
perfections; and it is this simpliciti^ which makes our soul have no other
aspect the^ toward God; and that she keep her self closeli^ recollected
wholly within her self, for to apply her self with all fidelity that is
possible for her to the obseruances of her Rules, not povvring out he^ self to
will nor desire to undertake to do more then this. She will not exercise
excellent and extraordinary things, which may cause her to be^ esteemed of
creaturrs; and therefore she houldeth her self very low (or) abject in her
self, and has no great satisfactions; for she does nothing o^ her own will,
nor any thing more then others and so all her sanctity is hidden from her eyes
God only sees it who delights himself in he^ simplicity, by the which
she rauisheth his heart, and unites her self to him. She cutteth of at a
blow all the inventions of self-love, which takes a singular delight to
enterprise great and excellent things and such as may cause us to be much
esteemed above others. Such souls do totallie enjoy great ^eace and
tranquillity of spirit. We must neither think nor believe, that doing
nothing more ^hen others, and follovving the community, we ^aue the less
meritt. O no! For perfection con^isteth not in austerities. Allthough they be
a good ^eanes to attain thereunto, and that they be good in themselves,
notvvithstanding for us they ^re not: because they are not conform to our
Rules, nor to the spirit of them, it being more per^ection to keep our selves
within their simple ^bseruance and to follow the community, then ^o desire
to exceed it. The person who will keep ^er self within these limitts, I
assure you she shall ^inish a great journey in short time, and shall bring ^uch
fruit to her sisters by her example. In fine when we are to row it must be
done by mea^ure: the gally-slaues who row upon the sea, ^re not so soon
beaten for rovving a little lazilie, ^s if they guide not the stroke of the are
by mea^ure: we ought to endeavor to advance all the ^ouices very equally,
in doing the same things, to ^he end they row equally, and although all do
it ^ot with equal perfection, we cannot remedy it, ^he like is seen in all
communities.

. 7. But you say it is for mortification that you ^ay a little longer in the
quire on festival days ^hen others, because that the time that you have
al^eadie endured there, has succeeded well with you ^uring the space of two
or three hours together, ^ll have remained there. To this I aunsvvere you,
that it is not a general rule, that we must do all those things from which
we have repugnance, no ^ore tken to abstain from things to which we ^aue
inclination. For if a sister have an inclination ^o say the divine office, she
must not omit to assist ^ereat under pretext of mortifying her self. Moreover
on feastiuall days the time that remains, which is left free to do what
they please, each one may employ her self according to her devotion: yet it is
true notwistanding that haueing been three hours yea more in the Quire with
the community, it is mueh to be feared, that the quarter of an hour that
you stay there longer, i^ but a little morcell that you will give to
self-love.

. 8. In fine (my dear daughters) we must love our Rules very much, since
they are the means by which we should attain unto their end. Which is for
to guide us with facillitie to the perfection of Charity, which is the union of
our souls with god, and with our neighbor: and not only this; but also to
reunite our neighbor with God, the which we do by the way that we present
unto him, the which is very sweet and facille* No woema^ must be rejected
for want of corporal strenght, provided that she have a will to live according
to the spirit of the Visitation, which is (as ^ have said) a spirit of
humility toward God, and of Sweetness of heart toward our neighbor; and i^
is this spirit which causes our union as well with God as with our neighbor.
By humility we unite our selves with God, submitting our selves to the exact
observance of his wills, which are signified to us in our Rules: for we ought
piouslie to believe, that they have been composed by his inspiratio^ being
received by the holy church and approved by his Holiness, which are most
evident signs thereof. And therefore we ought to love them so much the more
tenderly, and to bind the fast every day upon our breasts many times, in
form of acknowledgment toward God who has given the^ us. By sweetness of heart
we unite our selves with our neighbor, by an exact punctual co^formitie o^
life, ma^ners, and exercises doing neither more no^ less then those with who^
we live, and that which marked unto us in the way wherein God has ^aced us
together, employing and settling all the ^rces of our soul to perform them
with all the ^erfection that shall be possible for us. But note this which I
have said many times, that we must be ^erie punctual in the observance of
our Rules eue^ ^ the very least little, it ought not to be vnder^^ood as
punctuallitie of Scruple: O no! for this is ^ot my meaning, but a punctualitie
of chaste spouses ^ho content not themselves to avoid the displea^^re of their
celestial spouse, but would do all that ^ey can, how little soever it may
be, that is most ^easing unto him.

. 9. It shall be much to the purpose that I propose ^^me remarkable example, unto
you, to make you ^^mprehend how acceptable to God the conform^^g of our selves
to the co^munitie in all things is. ^earke^ the^ to this that I will say to
you: wherefore ^inke you did our Lord and his blessed Mother sub^itt themselves
to the law of the presentatio^ and ^urification, but because of the love they
bear to (...) community. Truly this example should be ^^fficie^t to move
Religious persons to follow their ^ommunitie exactlie; never seuering
themselves from ^. For neither the son nor the Mother were in any sort
obliged to this law, not the son be^^use he was God; not the Mother
because she was most pure Virgin; they could easily have exe^pt^ themselves
whiout the knowledge of any person; ^r might she not have gone to Nazareth, in
guisse ^ goeing to Jerusalem? But she did not so: but ^erie simply followed the
community: she might ^erie well have said: The law is not made for ^y most
dear son nor for me, it does not ^^lige us at all: But since all men are
oblig^ thereunto, and observe it, we will submitt our selves very
willingly, for to conform o^ selves to every one of them, and not to be
si^guler in any thing. The Apostle Saint Paul say very well, that our Lord
in all things must be li^ to his brethren, sin excepted: But tell me was
fear of preuarication, which rendered the moth^^ and her son so exact in the
observance of the law? No truly it was not that; for there was n^ any
preuaricatio^ for them; But they were draw^ by the love they carried to their
eternal Father No man can love the commandment, exce^^ he love him that
made it. According to the me^sure that we love, and esteem him that made the
law, we shall render our selves exact in the obse^uance thereof. Some are
tied to the law vvi^^ chains of iron, and others with chains of gould
would say seculars, who observe the commaundments of God* for the fear they
have of being damned, observe them by force, and not for love. B^ Religious,
and those who have care of the perfecti^^ of their souls, are tied thereunto
with chains (...) gold, that is to say, by love: they love the commau^dements
and observe them louinglye, and to observe them the better, they embrace the
obseruanc^ of the counsels: and David said that God hat^ commanded, that his
commandments should be very well keept; Behold how he willet^ that we
be punctual in observing of them: Ce^tainlie all true lovers do so: for they
avoid n^ only the preuarication of the law: but also the^ avoid the very
shadovve of the preuarication; an^ for this cause the espouse says that his
spouse resembled a Dove, who keeps her self besides the rivers, that run
svveetlie, and whose waters ar^ christaline. You know well that the dove
houlder her self secure near to the waters, because tha^ she seethe there the
shadows of the praying fou^ ^s that she fears, and so soon as she sees
them ^^e takes her flight, and so she cannot be surpris^d. In like sort
(will the Sacred espouse say) is my ^eloued: for whiles she flies before the
shadovve ^f the preuarication of my commandments, she ^eareth not to fall
into the hands of disobedience. ^ruelie that person who depriueth himself of
^imselfe voluntarily, by the vow of obedience, ^ot to do his will in
indifferent things, shows ^^fficientlie that he loves to be subject in
those ^^at are necessary, and of obligation. We must ^^en be exceeding
punctual in the observance of ^he laws and Rules, which are given us by our
lord: but above all in this point of follovving of ^he community, and we must
take heed of saying ^^at we are not bound to observe this Rule, or
^articular commandment of the Superior, for ^o much as it is made for the
weak and we are ^rong and healthful; nor on the contrary, that the
^ommaundment is made for the strong and we ^^e weak and infirm: O God!
there must be nothing less then this in a community. I conjure ^ou if you
be strong, that you weaken your selves ^or to yeald your selves conform to
the infirm, and if you be weak, I say to you strenghten your ^elues to
martch fitly with the strong. The great A^ostle Saint Paul says that he
made himself all ^o all, for to gain all: who is infirm with whom am not?
who is si ke with whom I am not sick? ^ith the strong I am strong. Behold
how S. Paul, ^he^ he is with the infirm, is infirm, and takes ^illingly
the commodities necessary to their in^^rmities to give them confidence to do
the same, ^ut when he finds himself with the strong, he ^s as a giant to
give them courage, and if he can ^erceaue his neighbor to be scandalized
with any thing that he does, allthough it were lawefull for him to do it,
notwithstanding he has such a zea^ of the peace and tranquillity of his
heart, that h^ willingly abstayneth from the same.

. 10. But you will say to me, now it is the hou^ of recreation, I have a
very great desire to go pra^ to unite my self more immediately with the
diuin^ goodness, may I not very well think, that the law which ordayneth
recreation, does not oblige me^ since I have a spirit Iouiall enough of my
self No! we must neither think it, nor speak it. If yo^ have not need to
recreate your self, notwithstanding you must make recreatio^ for those who
hau^ need thereof; Is there not any exception in Religion The Rules oblige
then all equally: ye as without doubt: but there are laws which are justly
vniu^ for example: The fast of Lent is commanded for every one, seems it
not to you that this law, unjust, since that the church moderateth this iniu^
Justice, giving dispensations to those that cann^ observe it? in like sort it
is in Religion: the commandment is equally for all, and none of them selves
can dispense therewith: but the Superiou^ moderate the rigor according to the
necessities o^ every one. We must take heed of thinking, tha^ the infirm
are less profitable in Religion then the strong, or that they do less, or
have less meritt because they do all equally the will of God. The Bees show
us an example of that which we say. For some of them are employed to keep the
hiue, an^ others are perpetually in labor to gather honey notwithstanding
those that remain in the hiue eat not less honey, then those that take the
pain to pick it out of the flowers. Does it not seem to you that David made
an unjust law, when he commanded that the soldiers that did guard the
baggage, should part the booty equally with those tha^ went to battaill, and
who returned all laden wit^ blows? No truly) it was not iniust, for so
much as ^ose that kept the baggage, kept the^ for those that ^d fight, and
those who were in the battle, did ^ght for those that kept the baggage, so
they deserved (...) one recompense, since they all obeyed equally their King.
God be Blessed.

THE FOVRTEENTH ENTERTAINMENT.
AGAINST SELFE-IVDGMENT AND THE tenderness we have over our selves.
^. 1. THe first question is: If it be a thing very contrary to perfection,
to be subject to ^nes selfe-opinion: whereunto I answer, that to ^^e subject
to have selfe-opinio^s or not to have the^, ^ a thing that is neither good nor
evil, for so much (...) it is natural to every one to have selfe-opinio^s,
^ut this does not hinder us from attayning to per^^ction, provided that we
tie not our selves ^erevnto, or that we love them not; for it is ^nely the
love of our own opinions which is ^finitly contrary to perfection, and this
is that which I have so oftentimes said, that the love ^f our proper judgment,
and the esteem we ^ake of it, is the cause that there are so fevve per^ct;
there are found many persons, which re^ounce their proper will, some for one
subject, ^^d others for another: I say not only in Religi^n, but amongst
seculers, and in the Courts of ^rinces themselves: If a Prince command a
cour^er any thing, he will never refuse to obey; but to auowe that the
commandment is well made, the arriueth rarely. I will do what you
commaun^ me in the manner you desire, will he answer but they allwaies pause
upon their, but; which is much as to say, that they know well it should b^
better otherwise. None can doubt (my dear da^ghters) but that this is very
contrary to perfection for it produces ordinarily unquietness of spirit
variances, murmurations, and in fine it nourishe^ the love of proper
estimation; And therefore pr^per-opinion and selfe-iudgment ought neither ^ be
esteemed nor loved! But I must tell you the there are persons, who ought to
form their op^nions, as Bishops, and Superiors are to do, vv^ have charge of
others, and all such as have goue^ment: Others ought not to trouble themselves,
v^lesse obedience so ordain: For otherwise the should loose their time, which
they ought to i^ploy faithfully in retayning themselves with Go^ and as the
inferiors should be esteemed little atte^tiue to their perfection, if they
would settle the^ selves to consider their self opinions; so likevvi^ the
Superioures should be held incapable of the charges, if they did not form
their opinions, a^ would not take sinall resolutions, although the ought not to
content themselves therein, nor to t^ themselves thereunto: for this should be
contra^^ to their perfection. The great Saint Thomas, w^ had one of the
greatest spiritts that a man co^ have, when he formed any opinions, h^ did
ground them upon the most pregnant re^sons that he could: and nevertheless if
he four^ any one who did not approve that which he h^ judged good, or
contradicted him therein, h^ would not dispute nor be offended in himself but
suffered it willglye. Wherein be manifest^ very well, that he did not love
his own opinion yet so that he did not disapproue it neither, leaving so as
others should find it good or no; after he ^d performed his part he troubled
himself no ^rther. The Apostles were not addicted to their ^ne opinions, no
not even in things appertayn^^g to the government of the Holy church which ^as
an affayre of so great importance, so that after ^cy had determined the cause
by the resolution which they had taken, they were not offended if any ^d
censure the same, and if any did refuse to agree their opinions, although they
were very well ^ounded; they did not seek to make them to be ^^ceaued by
contesting nor by disputes. If then the ^^periours would change opinions at all
encoun^s, they would be esteemed light, and imprude^t their governments: so
also if those who have no ^rges, would tie themselves to their opinions,
de^cing to mayntaine them, and cause them to be ^ceaued, should they not be
held for obstinate? yes ^elie. For it is a most assured thing, that the love
selfe-opinion degenerateth into obstinacy, if it ^e not faytfully mortified
and cut off. We see an ^mple of it even amongst the Apostles: It is an
^mirable thing that our Lord has permitted any things that the Apostles have
done, worthy ^elye to have been written, to lie hidden under ^rofound silence,
and that the imperfection, which ^gee at Saint Paul and Saint Barnaby commit^
together, has been written: It is without ^ubt a spetiall providence of our
Lord, who would ^^e it so for our particular instruction: they went ^th
together to preach the holy Gospel, and took ^th them a young man called John
Mark, who ^s kinsman to Saint Barnabee; These two great ^ostles fell into
dispute whether they should take (...) with them or leave him, and finding
themsel^ of a contrary opinion upon this fact, and not being able to agree,
they separated themselves o^ from the other? Now therefore tell me, oug^ we to
be troubled, when we see some defect amongst our selves, since the Apostles
did also co^mitt them?

. 2. There are certain great spiritts that a^ very good, but who are so
subject to their opinion and esteem them to be so good, that they w^ never
forgo them, and good heed must be tak^ not to ask it of them
incircumspectlie and vn^wares: For after wards it is almost impossible, ^ make
them acknowledge and confess, that they ha^ failed, for so much as they thrust
themselves so fa^ into the search of reasons, to mayntane that whi^ they have
once said to be good, that there is ^ means, unless they give themselves to
an excel^ perfection, to make them unsay what they ha^ said. There are also
found great spiritts, and ve^ capable, that are not subject to this
imperfection but very vvillinglye dismiss their opinions, ^ though that they
be very good; they arm ^ themselves to the defense of them, when any
co^trarietie, or contrary opinion is opposed to t^ which they have judged for
good and well assu^ even as we have said of the great Saint Thom^ whereby
you see it is a natural thing to be subi^ to opinions; ordinarily
melancholy persons ^ more given thereunto then those that are of a ^uiall and
pleasant humor; for these are eas^ turned at every hand, and facile to
beleeue^ which is said to them. The great Saint Paula ^ obstinat in
mayntaining the opinion that she ^ formed to her self, of exercising great
austerit^ rather then she would submitt herself, to the ^uise of many that
did council her to abstain; a^ likewise many other Saints who thought the
must macerate their bodies very much to pl^ God, in such sort that they
therefore refuse^ obey the physician, and to perform that which was requisite
to the conservation of their perishing and mortal bodies; and although this
was an imperfection, they leave not for this to be great Saints and ^erie
acceptable to God; the which teaches us, that we ought not to trouble our
selves, when we perceive in our selves imperfections, or incli^ations
contrary to true virtue, provided that we ^ecome not obstinate to persevere
willingly in them: For Saint Paula and others rendering them^elues stifneckt,
although it was in a small matter, ^aue been reprehensible in the same.
Concerning our selves we must never omit so to form our opinions, but that
we will willingly depose them ^vhen it is needful, whether we be
obliged or not obliged to form them. Therefore to be subject to esteem of
our own judgment, and to ^eeke out reasons to mayntaine that which we ^aue
apprehended and found to be good, is a very ^aturall thing: but to permit
our selves to go ^hereafter, and to be fastened thereunto would be a notable
imperfection. Tell me, is it not time unprofitably lost, espetiallie in those
that have not ^harge, to muse on this?

. 3. You say, what must we do then to mor^ifie this inclination? we must
cut of that which ^ourisheth it; it comes into your mind that ^our
Superior erreth in commanding this or that ^o be done in such manner, and
that it would be ^etter done so as you have conceived? turn from ^ou this
thought, saying to your self, Alas ^ what ^aue I to do with it since it is
not committed to me? It is allwaies much better to withdraw our ^hought
simply, then to search reasons in our mind ^o make us believe that we have
done vvrong* ^or in steed of doing it, our understanding which ^s preoccupated
of her particular Judgment will give us the change; in such sort that in steed
of annihilating our opinion, it will give us reasons to maintain it, and
acknowledge it for good. It is always more profitable to contemn it
without regarding it, and to chase it away so promptly when we perceive it,
that we know not what it was that it would say. It is very true that we
are not able to hinder this first motion of complacence when our opinion is
approved and followed; for this cannot be avoided: but we must not muse upon
this complacence, we must bless God and pass it over, not troubling our
selves more with this contentment then of a little feeling of grief, which
would come to us if our opinion were no^ followed or found good. We must
when it is required, either for Charity or of obedience to propose our advise
upon the subject whereof the question is, do it simply; but for the rest we
mus^ yeald our selves indifferent, whether it be receaue^ or not. We may
sometimes argue upon the opinions of others, and show the reasons vvhervppon
our reasons do depend but we must do this modestly and humbly, not dispising
the advice of others nor contesting to make ours to be received. I^ may be
you will ask, if it be not to nourish thi^ imperfection, to seek afterward
to speak vvit^ those who have been of your opinion, when ther^ is no more
question of taking resolution, it being already determined what ought to be
done; without doubt this would be to nourish, and maintain our inclination,
and consequently to commit an imperfection* for it is a true mark that on^
submits not her self to the advice of others, and that she always
prefers her own particula^ judgment. The thing being determined which had
been proposed, we must not so much as speak^ nor think thereof, unless it
were a thing notabl^ wicked: for then if we could yet further find some
invention to alter the execution, or to remedy the business, we ought to do
it the most charitably that could be, and the most innocently, to ^he end not
to trouble any person, nor to contemn that which they should have found to
be good.

. 4. The sole and only remedy to cure proper ^udgment, is to neglect that
which comes into our thought, applying our selves unto some better thing:
for if we will permit our selves to make reflection upon all the opinions
that diverse encounters will suggest unto us; what will arrive but a continual
distraction, and an impeachment of things more profitable, and which are
proper for our perfection, making us become incapable to make holy prayer? For
having given leave to our spirit to muse it self in the consideration of such
deceates, it will always thrust it self more forwards, and will produce
thoughts upon thoughts, opinions upon opinions, and reasons upon reasons which
will maruelouslye importune us in prayer: For prayer is no other thing then a
total application of our spirit with all her faculties unto God. Now being
vvearied out in the poursuite of unprofitable things, it becomes so much
less able and apt for the consideration of the mysteries, on which we
would make our prayer. Consider then this that I had to say upon the subject
of the first question, by the which we have been taught, that to have
opinions is not a thing contrary to perfection; but to have the love of our
own opinions and consequently to esteem them. For if we did not esteem
them, we should not be so amorous of them: and if we did not love them, we
should little care to have them approved, and we should not be so ready to
say, let others believe what they will, but as for my self: do you know
what that is you would say (as for my self) verily no other thing but I will
not submitt my self; but rather I will be constant in my opinion and resolution.
This is, as I have many times said, the last thing that we leave; and
notwithstanding this is one of the most necessary things to be quitted and
renounced for the attayning of true perfection, for otherwise we shall never
gain holy humility, which hinders and forbids us to make any esteem of
our selves or of all that depends thereon; and therefore if we have not the
practice of this virtue in great recommendation, we shall allwaies think our
selves to be better then we are, and that others come short of us, and owe
us respect.

. 5. Now enough is said upon this subject, If you ask me nothing more we
will pass to the second question, which is; If the tenderness that we have
over our selves do not hinder us very much in the way of perfection: That you
may understand this the better, I must put you in mind of that which, you know
very well, to wit, that we have two loves in us, the affectiue love, and the
effectiue love: and this is as well in the love that we bear toward God, as
in that which we have toward our neighbor, and furthermore toward our
selves: but we will speak here but of tha^ of our neighbor, and then we
will return to our selves. The divines to make the difference o^ these two
loves to be the better comprehended are accustomed to serve themselves with
the comparison of a Father who has two sons, the one of them is a little
minion, as yet a very child, o^ good grace: And the other is a perfect man, a
brave and generous soldier, or of some other condition. The Father exceedingly
loves these two sons, but with a different love; For he loves the little
one with an extreme tender and affectiue love; mark I pray you, what is
there that he does not permit this little infant to do unto him? He dandels
him, he kisseth him, be setts him upon his knees, houldeth him in his arms,
with exceeding delight asvvell to the child as to himself; if the child be
stung with a Be, he cease not to blow upon the hurt, until such time as
the grief be appeased; If his eldest son had been stunge with a hundred
Bees, he would not have vouchsafed to move his foot, although he love him
with a great, strong, and solid love. Consider I pray you, the difference of
these two loves; for although you have seen the tenderness that this Father
has to his little one, he does not therefore ^eaue his design to send him
forth of his house, and to make him a Knight of Malta, appointing his ^lder
son to be his heir, and inheritour of his estate: This elder then is loved
with effectiue love, and the other little one with affectiue love, the one and
the other are loved but differentlie; The ^oue that we have to our selves, is
of this sort affe^tiue and effectiue. The effectiue love is it, that ^ouerneth
great persons, ambitious of Honor and ^f Riches; for they do procure to
themselves as much goods as they can, and are never satisfied in ^etting: these
love themselves exceedingly with this ^ffectiue love: But there are others
that love them^elues more with the affectiue love, and these are ^ose, who
are very tender of themselves, and who noe nothing but bemoane, dandle,
cherish, and con^rue themselves, and who fear so much all that ^ay hurt them,
that it is a great pity to behold ^em: If they be sick, when they have no
more ^^yne then in their fingers end, there is no^ing more hurt then they are,
they say they are ^ost miserable, no evil, how great soever it be, is
comparable to that they suffer, and they cannon find medicines sufficient to
cure them, they cease not to medicine themselves, and in thinking to conserve
their health they loose it and ruinate i^ altogether: if others are sick it is
nothing; in fine there is none but they who are to be bemoane^ and are
subject to weep te^derlie over themselves endeavoring thereby to move those
that see them to compassion; They take little care, vvhethe^ others esteem
them patient or no, so that they believe them to be very sick and afflicted:
imperfections certainly proper to children, and, if I dur^ say it, to women,
and furthermore amongst men to those that are of an effeminate heart and little
courageous: for amongst the generous this imperfection is not met with all,
for well made spirits stand not upon these childish toys and sottis^
delicacies, which are proper for nothing but t^ stopp us in the way of our
perfection: and yet for a this, we cannot endure that one esteem us
del^cate; is not t^is very much tenderness?

. 6. I remember a thing that happened to m^ retourning from Paris. I encountered
in a house t^ Religious women with this accident which ser^eth to my
purpose, and truly I had more cons^lat^on in this encounter, then I had in
all n^ journey, although I had met with many very ve^tuous souls; but this
one did comfort me about all. There was in this house a maid who man her
^riall or nouitiate she was meruelouslie gent^ docile, subject, and obedient:
in fine she had all t^ most necessary conditions to be a true Religion
vvoeman: in the end it happened by misfortune, the her sisters did mark in her a
corporal imperfect which was cause that they began to be in dou^ whether
they oug^t not to dismiss her for t^ cause. The mother Superior loved her
very mu^ and was troubled to do it: but notwithstanding the sisters did
strongly ground themselves upon this corporal incommoditye: Now when I was
there, the matter was referred to me touching this good poor soul, who is
well descended; she was brought before me, being there she placed her self
upon her knees, It is true my Lord, said she, that I have such an
imperfection, which truly is so shameful (naming it alovvde with great
simplicity) I confess that our sisters have very great reason, not to be
willing to receive me, for I am insupportable in my defect; But I beseech you
to be favorable unto me, assuring you if they receive me exercising their
charity toward me, that I will have a great care not to trouble them,
submitting my self with all my heart to keep the garden ^or to be employed
in other offices whatsoever they be, that may keep me far of from their
company, to the end I may not molest the^. Truly this mayde^ touched my
heart, O she was not much tender of her self: I cannot hold my self from
saying, that I would with all my heart have the same natural defect, and
vvithall have the courage to declare it before the whole world with the same
simplicitye that she did before me; she had not so much fear of being
disesteemed as many others have, neither was she so tender over her self;
she did not make any of these vain and unprofitable considerations, what
will the Superior say if I declare this or that to her? if I ask her any
help or relief, she will say or think, that I am very delicate: and if it
be true, why would you not that she should think so? But when I tell her
my necessity she makes me so cold a countenance, that it seems that she is
not pleased with it: It may very well be, my good daughter, that the
Superior having other things enough in her head, has not always attention
to smile or speak very graciously, when you delare to her your grief, and
this is it you say which troubles you, and takes from you the confidence to
speak to her of your infirmities: O God! my dear daughters these are childish
toys, we must go simply: If the Superior or the mistrisse have not
entertained you as you desire, one time, yea many; you must not be disgusted
therefore, nor judge they do allwaies the same: O no: Our Lord will touch them
it may be with his spirit of sweetness, for to yeald themselves more pleasing
at our next return; so we must not be so tender as to desire allwaies to
speak of all the infirmities we have, when they are not o^ importance: a
little head ache, or a little tooth ache, which will quickly pass perchance
if you would bear it for the love of God, there is no need to go speak to
make your self to be beemoaned a little* it may be you will not speak to the
superior, o^ to her that may take care to ease you; but with more facillitie
to others* because say you that you would suffer this for God, O my dear
daughter, if it were so that you would suffer it for the love of God, a^ you
think: you would not go to tell it to another that you know well, will find
her self obliged to declare your grief to the Superior, and by this means
fetching a compass you shall have your co^tentment, but in good earnest you
had better make your demand simply to her that can give you leave to take it;
for you know well, that the sister that you speak to of your headache, has
not power to bid^ you go lie down on your bed; this the^ is no other design
or inte^tio^ (although we think not so expreslie) but to the end to be
bemoaned a little by this sister, and this does greatly satisfy selfe-loue^
Now if it happen by encounter that you speak it (the sister it may be asking
you how you do at that time) there is no harm, so that you tell it simply,
without aggravating it or bewailling your self; But more then this, must not
be spoken but to the Superior, or to the mistrisse; you must no more be
afraid, although they be a little rigorous in correcting such a fault; For, my
dear daughter, you take not from the^ the co^fide^ce and liberty to correct
you, go simply then, tell the^ of your grief: I believe well that you take
more pleasure, and are more co^fide^t to tell your pain to her who has not
the charge to comfort you, the^ to her that has care and power to do it:
whiles you do so; every one bemoaneth you, and all set themselves a work to
provide you remedies, whereas if you told it to the sister who has charge of
you, you must enter into subjection to do that which she should ordain, and
whiles with all your heart you avoid this blessed subjection, self-love seeks
to be your gouernesse and yet, mistrisse of your will, But if I tell the
Superior (you reply,) that I have the headache, she will bidd me take my
rest, well: what is that to the purpose? If your necessity be not such, it
will cost you little to say, mother or sister I think I am not so ill as to
lay me down on my bed; and if she say, you shall do it notwithstanding,
go your ways simply: for we must allwaies observe great simplicity in all
things; to walk simply is the true way of the Religious of the visitation,
which is exceeding pleasing to God and most assured. But seeing a sister that
has some trouble in her mind, or some other incommoditie, not to have the
confidence or courage to overcome her self to declare it to you, and you
perceive very well that the want thereof does carrye her into some melancholy
humor; ought you to call her to you, or to let it come of her self? In this,
consideration must govern us: for sometimes we must condescend to informing
our selves what the matter is, and at other times we must mortify these
humors, in letting the^ alone, as who would say, you will not overcome your
self to ask remedy for your pain, suffer ir then in good time, you deserve
it well.

. 7. This delicacie is much more insurpportable in things of the spirit then
in corporal: and yet it is most infortunatlie practiced and nourished by
spiritual persons, who would be Saints in an instant, desiering
notvvithsta^ding that it should cost them nothing, no not the sufferinge of the
combatts the inferior part causes them, by the feeling that it has in things
contrary to nature, and yet will we or will we not we must have courage
to endure it, and consequently to resist these schirmishes all the time of our
life in many encounters, if we will not become bankrupt in the perfection
that we have undertaken. I always desire very much that we distinguish
the effects of the supe^iour part of our soul, from the effects of the
inferior part, and that we be never astonished at the productions of the
inferior part of our soul how evil soever they be. For that is not capable
to stopp us in the way, provided that we hold our selves constanc in the
superior part, to advance our selves always forvvard in the way of
perfection, without studying and loosing our time, to bewail our selves,
that we are imperfect, and worthy of compassion, as if we were to do no
other thing, then lament our misery and misfortune, for being so backwards to
come to the topp of our enterprise. This good virgin of whom we have spoken
was nothing tender or reserved in speaking to me of her defect: but she told
it me with a heart and countenance very assured, wherein she pleased me much.
But for us it does us so great good to weep upon our defects to content self
love. We must (my dear daughthers) be very generous, and not astonished to
see our selves subject to a thousand sorts of imperfections, and yet have a
great courage to contemn our inclinations, our humors, fantasticallnesse, and
delicacies, faithfully mortifying all this at every occasion: and if
notvvithstanding we happen to committ defects now and then, we must not
therefore be at a stay; but must raise our courage up again to be more
faithful at the next occasion, and so pass further, making progress in the
way of God, and in the renuntiation of our selves.

. 8. You demand moreover, if the Superior seeing you more sadd then
ordinary, ask you what is the matter: and you seeing many things in your head
that molest you, cannot tell what it is; how must you do then? you must say
simply, I have many things in my head, but I know not what it is. You fear
say you, the Superior will think you have not confidence to tell her; But
what ought you to care, what she thinks or thinks not; provided that you
do your duty, whereof do you trouble yourselfe? so that to say, what will
she say if I do this, or that, or what will the Superior think, is
exceeding contrary to perfection, when we settle our selves therein. For
you must always remember in all that I say, that I intend not to speak of
that which the inferior part of the soul does: for I make no reckoning of
it, it is then the superior part that must contemn this what will they say?
or what will they think? this happens to you, when you have rendered an
account of your conscience because you have not sufficiently told particular
faults; you say you think the superior will say or think that you would
not tell her all: it is the same of this rendering of account, as of confession:
We must have an equal simplicitye in the one and in the other. Now tell
me, should I say, if I confess such a thing, what will my confessor say, or
what will he think of me? Let him think and say what he will, provided
that he has given me absolution, and tha^ I have done my duty, it suffices
me: and as after confession it is not time to examine our selves, to see if
we have told all that we have done: but i^ is the time to keep our selves
in tra^quillitye closely attentive to our Lord, with whom we are reconciled,
and to give him thanks for his benifitts, it being nothing necessary to make
a search o^ that which we have forgotten: in like manner it is when we have
rendered our account: That which comes to our mind must be simply told, afte^
it must no more be though of: But eue^ as it would not be a good preparation
to go to confession not to be willing to examine our selves, for fear^ of
finding something worthy to be confessed: in lik^ sort we must not neglect to
enter into our selue before the rendering of account, for fear of findin^
something, which should be troublesome to speak Nether must you be so tender
to speak all, nor to ru^ne to the superior to cry hola for the least payn^
that you feel, the which it may be will be past within a quarter of an hour.
we may well learn to suffer so^what generouslie these small matters for which
we cannot procure remedy, being ordinarily the productio^s of our imperfect
nature; as are these inconstancies of humors, of wills, of desires, vvhic^
produce so^times a little perplexity; so^times a desir^ to speak, and the^ all
of a sudden a great auersio^ t^ do it, and the like, to which we are
subject, an^ shall be as long as we live in this passing and decayin^ life. But
touching this pain that you say you have and which takes from you the means
to keep yo^ atte^tiue to God, unless you go prese^tlie to decla^^ it to the
superior, I say to you, that you must note that it may be it takes not from
you the attentio^ to the presence of God; but rather the sweetness of this
attentio^: Now if it be but this, if you have the courage and the will as you
say to suffer it without seeking of comfort, I tell you that you shall do
very well to do it; although that it do bring you some little unquietness
provided it be not too great: but if it should take from you the means to
draw near to God, at that time you should go to let the Superior know of
it, not to seek comfort, but to gain way in the presence of God, although
there would be no great harm to do it for your comfort: moreover the sisters
must not be so tied to the kind entertaynment of the superior: That if she
speak not to them according to their content, presently they persuade
themselves by consequence that they are not believed. O no, our sisters do love
humility and mortification too much, to be from henceforth melancholy upon a
light suspicion (which may be without ground) that they are not so well beloved
as their self-love makes them desire to be.

. 9. But (some one will say) I have committed a fault against the superior,
and therefore I enter into these apprehensions that she is displeased with me,
and in a word that she will not have me in so good esteem as she has had. My
dear sisters, all this discontent is made by the co^maundment of a certain
spiritual Father who is called self love, who begins to say, how? have I
failed in this manner? what will our mother say or think of me? O! there is
nothing to be expected that is good of me, I am a poor miserable creature, I
shall never do any thing that may content our mother, and the like wise
lamentations: they do dot say, Alas! I have offended God, I must have recourse
to his goodness hopeing hat he will strenghthen me: They say O I know well
that God is good, he will not regard my vnfay^hfullnes, he knovveth very
well our infirmitye, A^? but our mother. This we renevve still to continue
our complaints: without doubt care must be had to please our superiors: For
the great Apostle Saint Paul declares it and exhorts thereunto, speaking to
servants and it may also be attributed to children. Serve, says he; your
Masters to the eye, as if he would say, have a care to please them; but after
he also said. Serve not your masters to the eye, as if he had said, that
they must look well to themselves* for to do nothing more in the sight of
their masters, then they would do being absent, because the eyes of God does
always see them, to whom they ought to have a great respect not to do any
thing that may displease him, and in so doing, they must not trouble
themselves, nor car^ to desire always to please men, for it is not i^ their
power, do the best you can not to vex or anger any person: but after this if
it happen, that by your infirmitye you discontent them sometimes recurr
persently to the doctrine that I have so often preached to you, and which I
have had so great a desire to grave in your hearts, humble your selves
instantly before God, acknovvledging your frailty and weakness, and then
repair your fault wit^ an act of humilitye, if it deserve it, toward the
person that you have disquieted, and this done never trouble your self: For
our spiritual Father which is the love of God forbidds us to do so, teaching
us that after we have made an act of humility even as I have said, we
should re-enter into our selves, for to cherish tenderlye and deareli^ this
blessed abiection, which happens to us for having offended, and this
well-beloved reprehension that the Superior will give us: we have tvv^ (...)
^vvo Judgments and two wills, and therefore we must make no recknoning of
all that self love, self judgment, or self will suggesteth unto us,
provided that we do make the love of God to ^aygne above self love, the
judgment of Superiors yea of inferiors and equals above our own (which
we must annihilate as near as we can) not contenting our selves to subject
our will, in doing all that they will have us do, but sub^ecting our
judgment to believe that we should have no judgment, if we did not esteem
this to be justly and reasonably done, rejecting also abso^utelie the reasons
that it would bring to make us ^eleeue that the thing which is commanded us,
^bould be better done otherwise, then as they have ^idden us. We must with
simplicity allege our reasons for once, if they seem good; but then we
must yeald without more replies, to that which ^hey say to us, and by this
means make our selfe-^udgment dye, which we esteem so wise and ^rudent
above all others; O God! mother, our si^ters are so resolved to love
mortification, that it will be a pleasing object to behold them, consola^ions
will be nothing to them, in comparison of the ^rice of afflictions, drinesses
and repugnances; so much do they desire to render themselves like to their
spouse. Assist them therefore well in their en^erprise, mortifye them well and
courageously, not ^paring them: for it is that which they demand, ^hey will no
more be tied to cherishings, since it is contrary to the generositie of their
devotion, the which will make them hereafter, to set themsel^es so absolutely
to desire to please God, that they will no more regard any other thing, if it
be not ^roper to advance them in the accomplishment of ^his desire. It is the
mark of a delicate heart, and a ^ender devotion, to permit our selves to be
carried away with every little encounter of contrad^ction: be not afraid;
these childeshnesses of a melancholye and spightfull humor will never be^
amongst us. We hane so much courage, thanke^ be to God, that we will apply our
selves to mak^ so good progress hereafter, that it willbe agre^ contentement
to behold us. In the mean time my Dear danghters, let us purify our
intention to the end that doing all for God, for his Honor and Glory, we do
expect our recompense onli^ from him: his Love shall be our reward here, an^
himself shall be our recompense in all eternity.

THE FIFTEENTH ENTERTAINMENT.
IN WHICH IS DEMAVNDED VVHEREI^ consists the perfect determination of
regar^ing, and follovving the will of God in (...) things: and whether we
may find a^^ follovv it in the wills of Superiors, equal^ and inferiors
which we see to proceee^ upon their natural or habitual inclination and of
some notable points touching Co^fessours and Preachers.
. 1. We must know that the determin^tio^ of following the will of God ^ all
things without exception, is contained in o^ Lords prayer in these words that
we say eue^^day: Thy will be done in earth as it is in heau^ There is not
any resistance of the will of God ^ heaven, all are obedient and subject to
him: eu^^ so say we that it may arrriue to us, and this vv^ ask of our Lord
to do, never bringing any re^^stance there unto: but remaining most obedi^^^
and subject, in all occurrences to his divine w^^ But the souls thus
determined have need to be ^nlightned, in what they shall be able to know this
will of God. Of this I have spoken very clearly in ^he book of the Love of
God: Notwithstanding to satisfye the demand which has been made me, I will
here say something more. The will of God may be understood in thvvo manners.
There is the will of God signified, and the will of good pleasure. The will
of God signified ^s distinguished into four parts, which are the commandments
of God, and of the Church, Coun^ells, Inspirations, Rules and constitutions.
The ^ommaundements of God, and of the Church ne^essarilie every one must obey,
because it is the ^bsolute will of God, who wills that in this, we should
obey if we will be saved. He wills also that we should observe his
Counsels; but not with an absolute will, but only by way of desire;
wherefore we loose not Charity, neither shall we be separated from God, for
not having courage, ^o undertake Obedience to his Councelles; Likewise we
ought not to desire to undertake the pra^tice of all, but of those that are
most conform to ^ur vocation: For there are some of them which are ^o opposite
to others, that it will be impossible without doubt to embrace the practice of
the one, and ^ot to take away the means to practice the other; ^t is a
counsel to leave all for to follovv our Lord, ^aked void of al^ things: It is
a council to lend and give allmes; tell me, the person who has on^e forsaken
and given away all that he had, of what can he give Alms, since that he
has nothing? we must then follovv the conuncells that God would we should
follovv, and not believe that he has given them all, that we should fol^ovv
them all. Now the practice of the counsels that we here ought to practice,
are those that are contained in our Rules. Moreover vve^ have said that God
signifies his will to us, b^ his inspirations, it is true: but
notvvithstanding he will not, that we should discern of ou^ selves, if
this which is inspired, is his will, much less that we should
presumptiouslie follow hi^ inspirations: neither will he that we should
expect that he himself do manifest his wills, o^ that he send his Angels
to teach them us; Bu^ his will is that in doubtful cases and of importa^c^
we should have recourse to those, vvho^ he hat^ established over us, to guide
us, and that we should yeald our selves totallye subject to their counce^ and
opinion, in this which regards the perfection of our souls. Behold then
how God manifests his will, which we call signified will. Moreover there
is the will of the good pleasure of God the which we ought to behold in all
events, (...) would say in all that happens unto us, in sickness, i^ death in
affliction, in consolation, in adverse and properouse things, in brief in all
things which are no foreseen. And according to this will, we ough^
allwaies to be ready, to submitt our selves in a^ occurrences, in things
disaggreable, in death, as i^ life; in fine in all that is not manifestly
against the signified will of God; for that is always to b^ preferred.

. 2. This being so, we answer to the second part of the demand. That you
may the bett^^ understand this, I must tell you what I have read^ few days
past, in the life of the great Saint A^seline, where it is said; that during
all the tim^ that he was Priour and Abbott of his Monaster he was
exceedingly beloved of every one; because he was very co^descending
permitting himself, to yeald to the will of all, not only of t^^ Religious,
but also of strangers. One came to hi^ saying, Father, your Reverence should
take a little ^roth, he took it; an other came to him and said, This will
do you hurt; instantly he lest it: so he did submi^t himself (in all that
where in there was no offense to God) to the will of his brethren who without
doubt did follovv their own inclinations: especially the Seculers; who did
also make him turn at every hand according to their will. Now this great
gentleness and condescending of this Saint was not approved of all, allthough
he was well beloved of all, so that one day some of his brethren desiring to
shevve to him, that this went not well according to their judgment, and that
he ought not to be so gentle and condescending to the will of all the world;
but that he ought to make those whom he had in charge; to yeald unto his
will. O my children (said this great Saint) it may be you do not know with
what intention I do it: know then when I remember that our Lord has
commanded, that we should do to others as we would they should do to us,
I can do no otherwise; For I would that God did my will, and therefore I do
willingly that of my brethren, and of my neighbors, to the end it may please
our good God to do mine sometimes. Furthermore I have an other consideration,
which is that after that which is the signified will of God, I cannot know
better the ^ill of his good pleasure nor more assuredly, then b^ the voice of
my neighbor: For God does not speak to me, neither does he send his
Angels, to declare to me what is his good pleasure. The stones, brute beasts,
and plants speak not: there is no other then man, who can manifest the will
of my God to me, and therefore I bind my self to this as much as I can. God
commands me Charity toward my neighbor: and it is a great Charity to
conserve ones self in union one with another, and to preserve this, I do^ not
find a better means, then to be gentle an^ condescending: Sweetness and humble
condescendence ought allwaies to bear sway in all our actions. But my
principal consideration is, to beleeu^ that God manifests his will to me,
by those o^ my brethren, and therefore I obey God as oftentimes as I condescend
to them in any thing. Moreover has not our Lord said, that if we becom^ not
as a little child we shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven? do not
meruaill then if (...) be sweet, and facill to condescend as a child; sinc^
in this I do no other then that which has ben^ ordained by my savior. There
is not any great damage, whether I go to bed or remain vpp^^ whether I go
thither or remain here: but i^ should be an imperfection in me not to
submit^ my self to my neig^bour. You see, my dear sisters, the great Saint
Anselme submits himself to all that which is not contrary, nor against the
commandments of God or holy church, o^ against the Rules, for this obedience
is allwaies to be preferred I do not think that if they ha^ desired any of
this that he would have done it. O^ no! But this observed, his general Rule
was in these indifferent things to condescend wholly to all. The Glorious Saint
Paul, after that he had said, that nothing should separate him from the
Charity of God, neither death nor life, no not Angels themselves, nor all
Hell if it should band against him, should be able to do it; I know nothing
better (says he) then to yeald to all, to laugh with them that laugh, to
weep with those that weep, and in fine to yeald my self to every one.
Saint Pachome one day making matts had with him there a child, who beholding
what the Saint did, said unto him: O Father you do not well this must not
be done so. The great Saint ^llthough he did make these matts well enough
^euerthelesse arose readily, and set himself near unto the child, who
showed him how he should ^ake them. Now there was another Religious ^an,
who said to him: Father you committ two ^ults in condescending to the will of
this child; For ^ou expose him to the danger of vanity; and ^oile your matts,
for they were better so as you ^^d them; to whom the blessed Father aunswer^d:
My brother, if God permit that the child ^onceaue vanity, it may be that in
recompense ^ee will give me humility, and when he shall ^aue given it me, I
shall afterward be able to ^^ue some to this child. There is not any great
^rme to dispose in this or that manner the bulrus^es to make the matts; but it
would be very great ^nger, if we have not affection to this word (...)
celebrated of our savior: if you become not (...) little children, you shall
have no part in the king^ome of my Father. O what a great good is this, ^y
sisters, to be so facill and pliable to be turned (...) obedience at every
hand!

. 3. Now not only the Saints have taught us is practice of the submission of
our will: but also ^ir Lord, asvvell by example, as by word: but how (...)
word? the council of abnegarion of ones self, that other thing is it, but to
renounce in all occa^^ons his own will, and his particular judgment, follow
the will of another, and to submitt him^^^fe to all? allwaies excepting that
wherein we ^ould offend God. But it may be you will say, ^ee cleerlie, that
this, which they would have ^ee do, proceeds from a humayne vvil, and
^^turall inclination; and therefore God has ^t inspired my mother, or my
sister to make ^e do such a thing? No, it may be God does not inspire this to
her; yet truly he will that you should do it; and you failing therein
resist the determination of doing the will of God i^ all things; and
consequently the care you ought t^ have of your perfection; we must then
allwaie^ submitt our selves to do all that they desire of us for to do the
will of God; provided that it be no contrary to his will, which he has
signified i^ the manner aforesayed.

. 4. Now to speak a word of the will of creatures; it may be taken in three
kinds, by way o^ affection, by way of complacence, or else without intention,
or besides their design; according t^ the first, our will must be very
strong, to embra^^ willingly these wills, which are so contrary (...) ours,
which would not be contra^ried; and yet o^dinarilye we must suffer very
much in this pr^ctice of follovving the wills of others, which a^ for the most
part different from ours, we oug^^ therefore to receive by way of sufferance
the ex^cution of such wills, and to serve our selves of the daily
contradictions for to mortify us, accepti^^ them with love and gentleness; By
way of co^placence there is no need of exhortation to man us follow them: for
we obey most willingly delectable thing: yea we run before these wi^ to
offer them our submissions. Therefore it is (...) of this kind of will that
you demand, if we m^ submitt our selves thereunto: for we have (...) doubt
thereof: but of those that are far from t^ purpose, and of which we know
not the reas^^ wherefore one desires this of us: it is this where the
difficultye lies. For wherefore should I d^ the will of my sister, rather then
my own? also not mine as conform to the will of God as hers^ this slight
occurrence? for what reason ought (...) believe, that this, which she tells
me tha^ should do, is rather an inspiration of God, then ^he will that moves
me to do another thing? O God, my dear sisters, here it is where the Di^ine
Majesty would make us to gain the prise of ^ubmission; for if we did
allwaies perceive very ^ell, that they have reason to command us, or ^ay us
to do such a thing, we should not have any great meritt in doing it,
neither any great re^^gnance, because without doubt all our whole ^ule would
willingly grant this; but when the ^easons are vnknovve to us, our soul
repineth at it ^en our judgment stormeth, and we feel the ^ontradiction. Now
it is in these occasions, that ^ee ought to surmount our selves, and with a
^^ildish simplicity to put our selves to the business without discourse, or
reason, and say: I know very ^ell that the will of God is, that I should
rather ^e the will of my neighbor then my own, and ^^erefore I will set my
self to the practice thereof ^ot considering if this is the will of God, that
I ^^bmitt my self, to do that which proceeds of ^^ssion, or otherwise by an
inspiration, or motion of ^ason: for we must walk through all these small
^atters in simplicitye: I pray you to what purpose ^ould there be an hour of
meditation made, for ^ know if it be the will of God that I drink, ^hen they
pray me, or that I abstain by pe^nce or sobrietye, and the like small
matters which ^e not worthy of consideration, and principally, if see I shall
content my neighbor how little soe^^r in doing them? in things of consequence
we ^^ight not to loose our time in considering them, ^^at we must address
our selves to our Superi^^rs, to the end to know of them what we have ^ do,
after which they are no more to be thought (...) but when must depend
absolutely on their opinion, ^^nce God has given us them, for the guide of our
soul in the persection of his Love. And if we ought thus to condescend to the
will of every one much more ought we to do it to the will of Superiors,
whom we ought to esteem and regar^ amongst us, as the person of God
himself; for indeed they are his lieftenants; wherefore, althoug^ we should
know that they had natural inclinations yea passions themselves, by the
motions where of they should command sometimes, or reprehend the faults of
their inferiors, it should i^ no sort astonish us: for they are men as others,
an^ consequently subject to have inclinations, and pa^sions: but it is not
permitted us to judge; that the command us this out of their passion, or
inclin^tion: and this thing we must be very wary n^ to do; Notwithstanding
if we should know^ palpably that this was so, we must not omit (...) obey
sweetly and lovingly, and submitt our selu^ with humilitye to the correction.
It is a thing truly very hard to self-love to be subject to all the
encounters; it is true, but also it is not this Lo^^ that we ought to content
nor hearken unto but only the most Holy Love of our souls IESV^ who demau^deth
of his Dear spouses, a holy im^tation of the perfect Obedience that he
rendre^ not only to the most just and good will of h^^ Father; but also to
that of his parents, and which more to that of his enemies, who without do^^
did follovv their passions in the torments, whi^^ they imposed upon him, and
yet good Jesus subm^^ted himself to undergo them sweetly, humb^^ and
lovingly. We shall see sufficiently that the word of our Lord, which
ordayneth that we ta^^ up his Cross ought to be understood of receaui^^
cordially the contradictions, which are made (...) in all, encounters by holy
Obedience, how lig^^ and of how little importance soever they be. I w^^ give
you further an admirable example, to make you comprehend the valwe of these
little crosses, that is to say, of obedience, condescendance, and pliablenesse
to follow the will of every one: but espetially of superiors. Saint Gertrude
was religious in a monastery, where there was a superior, who did know
very well, that the blessed Saint was of a vveake and delicate complexion:
wherefore she caused her to be entertained more delicately then the other
Religious women, not permitting her to use the austerities, which the
custom was to do in that Religion; what think you then the poor virgin
did to become holy? no other thing, then to submitt her self very simply to
the mother, and although fervor did make her desire to do the same that
others did do, yet she made no show thereof, for when they commanded her to
go to bed, she went thither simply without reply, being assured she should
enjoy the presence of her spouse, asvvell within her bed by obedience, as if
she had been in the quire with her sisters and companions. And for testimony
of the great peace and tranquillity of spirit that she gained in this
practice, our Lord revealed to Saint Mictild her companion, that if any would
find him in this life, they should seek him first in the most Holy Sacrament
of the Alter, and then in the next place, in the heart of Saint Gertrude; We
must not be astonished at this, since the spouse says in tho Canticle of
Canticles, that the place where he rests himself is in the midday: He
says not, that he reposeth himself in the morning, nor in the Evening, but
in the Midday, because that in the midday there is not any shadow. The heart of
this great Saint was a true midday, where there was not any shadovve of
scruples nor self will; and therefore her soul did fully enjoy her beloved,
who did take his delights in her: In fine, obedience is the sal^ which gives
taste and savor to all our actions, and makes them meritorious of eternal
life.

. 5. Furthermore, I desire this day to speak two or three words of Confession.
First I desire you should bear a great respect to the Confessors: for
(besides that we are very much obliged to honor Preissthood) we ought to
regard them as Angell^ that God has sent us, for to reconcile us unto hi^
divine majesty: and not only this, but furthermore we ought to regard them
as the lieftenants of God upon earth; and therefore although it happen
sometimes, that they shevve themselves men^ committing some imperfections, as
demanding some curiosity, which is not concerning confession ^ as, what
should be your names? what penances you do? if you practice virtues? and
what they are? i^ you have any tentations? and the like; I would aunsvvere
according to that they ask, although you ar^ not obliged thereunto: for we
ought not to tel^ them, that we are not permitted to speak to them of any
other thing then that whereof you have accused your self: O no? we must
never use thi^ defect, for it is not true; you may say all whatsoever you will
in Confession, provided that you speak not, but of that which concerns your
particular; and not of that which concerns the general of your sisters. But
if you fear to speak o^ something they ask you, for fear of inta^gling you^
self, as shall be to tell them if you have any tentations; if you apprehend the
disclosing of them, in case they would know the particulers thereof you may
answer them I have had some, Father but by the grace of God I do not think
that (...) have offended his divine goodness therein, but neue^ say, you have
been forbidden to confess this or that Tell in good truth to your confessor,
all that which does br^^d you trouble, if you will: but I say again to you,
take heed to speak of a third nor of a fourth person.

. 5. In the second place, we have some reciprocal obligation to the
Confessors in the act of Confession to keep silent that which they s^all say
unto us, unless it be something of good edificatio^, and more then so we
ought not to speak. If it happen that they give you any council against your
Rules and manner of life, hear them with humility and reverence, and then you
shall do as your Rules shall permit, and not otherwise: the Confessors have
not allwaies intention to oblige you upon pain of sin to that which they
say to you* their counsels ought to be received by way of simple direction;
notvvithsta^ding esteem them much, and make a great account of all that they
shall say to you in Confession: for you cannott believe the great profitt that
there is in this Sacrament, for the souls that come thereunto with requisite
humility. If they would give you for penance any thing that were against your
Rule, pray them very gently to change this penance into an other, for so much
as being against your Rule, you fear to scandalize your sisters if you should
do it. Furthermore, you must never murmur against the confessor, if through
his fault something happen in Confession, you may speak simply to the
superior that you are very desirous if it please her to confess to some
other, without saying any thing: for so doing you shall not discover the
imperfection of the confessor, and also shall have the commodity to confess
to your content: but this is not to be done lightly and for matters of
nothing* we must avoid extremities: for as it is not good to support notable
defects in confessio^s; so we must not be so delicate, that we cannot bear
some small matters.

. 7. Thirdly, I desire very much that the sisters of the Visitation take a
great care to particularize their sins in Confession, I would say, tha^ they
who shall have nothing remarkable which were worthy of absolutio^ tell some
particular sinn^ for to say that they have many motions of choler, of sorrovv,
and the like, is not to the purpose: for choler and sorrovv are passions, and
their motion are not sin, for so much as it is not in our power to hinder
them, choler must be disordered or caus^ in us some disorderly actions to be
a sin, we^ must therefore particularize some thing that marketh a sin. I
desire moreover that you should hau^ a great care, to be very true, simple,
and charitabl^ in Confession, (truth and simplicity is one self same thing)
telling very ^learelie your faults, without vanity and without cunning,
making your account, that it is God to whom you speak, from wh^ nothing can
be concealed; and very charitable, no^ mingling any thing of another in your
Confessio^^ for example, having to Confess of what you hau^ murmured in your
selves, or else with the sister^ that the superior has spoken very drilie to
you^ do not say you have murmured at the harsh corr^ction that the superior
has given you: but simpl^ that you have murmured against the superior. Te^
only the evil that you have done and not the cau^^ and that which thrust you
therevppon, and neue^ directly not indirectlie discover the offense o^ others
in accuseing your self and never give willingly occasion to the Confessor to
suspect who it (...) that has contributed to your sin also allege no^ any
unprofitable accusations in Confession, as to sa^ you have had thoughts of the
imperfectio^s of you^ neighbor, of vanity, yea and worse, you have ha^
distractions in your prayers; if you have stayed d^liberatlie in them tell it
in verity* and content no^ your self to say, that you have not had sufficient
^are to keep your self recollected, dureing the time of your prayer, but if
you have been negligent to ^eiect a distraction say so, for these general
accusa^ions serve for nothing in Confession.

. 8. I desire moreover, my dear daughters, that in this house you bear great
honor to those who preach the word of God to you; truly we ^aue very much
obligation to do it. For, it ^eemeth that these are celestial messengers, who
^ome as from God to teach us the way of salua^ion, we ought to regard them as
such, and not as ^imple men; for although they speak not so well ^s celestial
men, we must not therefore diminish ^he humility and reverence wherewith we
ought ^o hear the Word of God, which is allwaies the ^ame, as pure and as
holy as if it were declared and ^ronunced by Angels. I mark how when I write
^o a person upon ill paper, and in a bad character, ^e gives me thanks with
as much affection, as when I write upon better paper, and in more legi^le
Characters; and why? because he makes not ^eflection upon the paper (which
was not good) ^or on the character (which was badd) but on me ^vho writ to
him in like sort ought we to do of the word of God: not to regard who it
is that ^eclareth it to us or preaches it, it ought to suffice ^s that God
serves himself of this preacher to ^each it us. And since we see that God
honors ^im so much as to speak by his mouth, how is it ^ossible that we
can be wanting to honor and ^espect his person?

THE SIXTEENTH ENTERTAYNMENT.
TOUCHING AVERSIONS; HOW VVE^ ought to receive books: and that vv^ must not
be astonished to see imperfections in Religious persons, no not in Superiors
themselves.
. 1. THe first Question is, what it is that we^ call auersion? Auersions are
certain inclinations, which are sometimes natural; which ar^ cause that we
have a certain grudge of heart at the approach of those toward whom we have
them which hinders us that we love not their conversation, that is to say,
we take no pleasure therein, as we would do in the company of those
toward vvho^ we have a svveete inclination which makes us love them with a
sensible love, because there is a certain alliance and correspondance
betvveene our spirit and theirs. Now to show that i^ is natural to love
some by inclination, and not others do we not see, that if two men enter
into a tennis court, where two others are playing at tennis, those who enter
will at the first sight have an inclination, that the one win rather then
the other, and whence comes this? since they have never seen the one nor
the other, nor have heard them spoken of; nor know not if one be more virtuous
then the other, wherefore they have no reason to be affectionate more to the
one the^ the other. We must then confess that this inclination of loving some
better then others is natural: we see it in beasts themselves, which have
no reason ye^ have this auersion, and this inclination naturally. Experience
makes this plain in a little la^be newly brought forth, show him the skin
of a woalfe (although he be dead) he setts himself to flight, he bleats,
he hides himself under the flanks of his damm; but show him a horse (which
is a much greater beast) he is nothing at all afraid, but will play with
him: the reason of this is no other, but that nature gives him sympathy with
the one, and antyp^thy from the other. Now we must make no great account of
these natural auersions, no more then of inclinations, provided that we
submitt our selves vvho^ie to reason. I have an auersion to converse with a
person, whom I know to be of great virtue, and with whom I may get much
profitt; I must in no sort follow my auersio^, which makes me avoid the
encounter of him, but I ought to subject this inclination to reason, which
ought to make me to seek his conversation, or at least to remain there with
a spirit of peace and tranquillity when I meet with the occasion: but there
are persons who have so great fear of having auersion from those they love by
inclination; that they avoid their conversation, for the fear they have of
meeting with some defect, which might take from them the svvetnes of their
affection and freindshipe. What remedy for these auersions, since none can
be exempt how perfect soever he be? Those who are naturally austere,
will have auersion from them that are very svveete, and and will esteem
this sweetness a very great remissenes, although this virtue of svvetnes, be
more vniuersalie loved. The only remedy of this evil (as of all other kinds
of temptations) is a simple diuersion, I mean, not to think thereon* but the
misery is that we would willingly know whether we have reason or not,
to have auersion from some person; O! we must never muse to seek this: our
self-love, which never sleeps, will gilde the Pill so wel^ for us, that it
will make us believe that it i^ good, I would say, that it will make us see,
that it is true we have certain reasons which will seem good to us, and
then these reasons being approved of our proper judgment and self-love, ^here
will be no more means to hinder from finding them just and reasonable. O!
truly we ought to take great heed of this. I extend my self to speak
somewhat herein, because it is a matter of importance. We never have reason
to have auersion, much less to have a desire to nourish it: I say then, when
these are simple natural auersions, we must make no account of them, but
divert our selves without making show of any thing and so deceive our spirit:
but we must fight and beat them down when we see that nature passes
further, and would make us depart from the submission we owe to reason,
which never permits us to do any thing in favor of our auersions, no more
then of our inclinations (when they are wicked) for fear of offending God.
Now when we do no other in favor of our auersions, then speak a little
less pleasinglie, then we should do to a person to whom we should have
great feelings of affection, this is no great matter, for it is not almost in
our power to do otherwise. And when we are in the motion of this passion,
they should do vvrong to require that of us.

. 2. The second demand is, how we ought to comport our selves in the
receiving of books which are given us to read? The Superior will give to one
of the sisters a book that ^reateth very well of virtues: but because she
loves it not, she will not make profitt of her reading: but will read it
with negligence of spirit: and the reason is, that she allreadie knows at
her ^ingers ends the contents thereof, and that caus^th her to have more
desire they give her another book to read. Now I say that this is an
imperfection, to have a will to choose or desire another book, then the same
that they give us, and this is ^ mark that we read rather to satifie the
curiosity of our spirit, then to profitt by our lecture. If we did read for
our profitt and not to content our selves, we should be as equally satisfied
with one book as with another, at least we would accept with a good will,
all those our superior should give us for to read. I say much more; for I
assure you that if we did never take pleasure to ^ead but one only book,
provided that it were good and did speak of God: yea when there should not
be in it, but only this name of God, we should be content, since we
should find business enough to do, after the reading of it over and over again
many times. For to desire to read to content curiosity, is a sign that we
have a little lightness of spirit, and that it does not sufficiently take care
to perform the good which it has learned in these little books of the
practice of virtues, for they speak very well of humility and mortification,
therefore they do not practice them when they accept not of them with a good
will.

Now to say, because I love the^ not I shall make no profitt of the^, is no
good consequence, no more then to say, I know allreadie all by heart, I can
take no pleasure to read it. All these are childish toys, do they give you a
book that you know already, or all most all, by heart? bless God for it, for
so much as you will more easily comprehend the doctrine thereof. If they give
you one that you have allreadie read many times, humble your self, and assure
your self that God would have it so, to the end you should be more careful
to do, the^ to learn, and that his goodness gives it you for the second and
third time, because you have not made your profitt thereof at the first
reading. But the misery from whence all this proceeds is, that we seek
always our own satisfaction, and not our greater perfection. If
peradventure they have regard to our infirmity, and that the Superior put us
to the choice of a book, what should we do? then we may choose it with
simplicity, but further then so, we must remain allwaies humbly submisse to
all that which the Superior ordayneth, whether it be to our liking or not,
never making show of the feelings we have contrary to this submission.

. 3. The third Question is, if we should be amazed to see imperfections
amongst our selves, or in our Superiors? Touching the first point, it is
without doubt, you ought not at all to be amazed if you see some
imperfections here within, even as in other houses of Religious women, how
perfect soever they be; for you shall never be able to do so much, as not to
committ some defects here and there, according as you shall be exercised. It is
no great marvel to see a Religious, who has nothing which troubles her,
or exercises her, to be very gentle, and to committ fevve faults: when
they say to me, behold such a one, whom we never savve committ
imperfection, I ask presently, has she any charge? if they tell me no, I
make no great account of her perfection: for there is much difference betvveene
the virtue of this one, and that of another who shall be well exercised, be it
interiourlie by tentations, be it exteriourlie by the contradictions that are
given her. For the virtue of streinght, and the strenght of virtue are never
gotten in the time of peace, and vvhiles we are not exercised by its
contrary.

Those who are very gentle vvhiles they have no contradiction, and who have
not gotten this virtue at the point of the spear, as we say, they are
truly very exemplar; and of great edification; but if you come to prove it,
you shall see them presently moved, and witness, how their svvetnesse was
not a strong and solid virtue; but imaginary rather then true. There is much
difference between having cessation from vice, and having virtue, which is
contrary to it. Many seem to be very virtuous, who nevertheless have not
virtue; because they have not purchased it with labor. Very often it happens
that our passions sleep, and rest senseless, and if in this mean time we
do not make provision of forces, to fight against them, and to resist them,
when they shall come to awake, we shall be overcome in the battaill. We must
allwaies remain humble, and not believe that we have virtues, although we
committ not (at least that we know) defects that are contrary to the^.
Truly there are many, who gently deceive themselves in this, that they
believe, that the persons that make profession of perfection should not stumble
into imperfections, and particularly Religious: because it seems unto them,
that entering into Religion they cannot fail to be perfect, which is not so;
for, Religions are not made to gather perfect persons together, but persons who
have courage to pretend perfection.

. 4. But what shall we do if we see imperfections in Superiors, asvvell
as in others? we ought not to be amazed at it: But I hope you make not
imperfect superiors, say you? Alas, my dear daughters, if we should make
none Superiors unless they were perfect, we must pray to God to send us
Saints or Angels to be our superiors; for we shall not find men capable:
we indeed seek that they may not be of wicked example: but not to have
imperfections, we take no heed therein, provided that they have the
conditions of spirit which are necessary, for so much as although there may
be found more perfect, yet notvvistanding they would not be so capable to be
Superiors. Alas, tell me, has not our Lord himself showed us, that he did
not take this consideration in the election that he made of Saint Peter for
Superior of all the Apostles? For every one knows what this Apostle did in
the death and passion of his Master, standing to talk with a maid servant
and so unhappily denied his most dear Master who had done him so much good
he made his brauado, and then in fine he took his flight: but besides this,
after he was confirmed in grace by receiving of the holy Ghost he did
committ a fault which was judged of such importance, that Saint Paul
vvritting to the Galathians: says to the^, that he had resisted him in the
face, because he was to be blamed. And not only Saint Peter, had his
imperfections but moreover Saint Paul, and Saint Barnabee also: for desiring
to preach the Gospel they had a little dispute together, because S. Barnabee
desired to take with them, John Mark who was his Cosen: S. Paul was of a
contrary opinion, and would not that he should go with them, and Saint
Barnabee would not yeald to the will of Saint Paul, and so they separated
themselves and went to preach, S. Paul into one country, and Saint Barnabee
into another with his Cosen John Mark; It is true our Lord drevv good out of
their variance, for else they had not preached but in one part of the world,
and by this means they cast the seed of the Gospel in diverse places. Let us
not think whiles we shall be in this life, to be able to live without
committing imperfections: for it cannot be, whether we be Superiors or
inferiors; since that we are all men* and consequently we have all need to
believe this verity as most assured, to the end that we be not astonished to
see our selves, yea all of us subject to imperfectio^s; our Lord has ordained
that we say every day these words which are in the Pater Noster: Forgive
us our offenses as we forgive them that have offended us: and there is no
exception in this ordinance, because we have all need to make it; It is no
good consequence to say, she is a Superior, and therefore she is not
choleric, or she has no imperfection. You wonder that coming to speak to
the Superior, she speaks some word less svveet then ordinary, it may be
she has her head full of cares and affairs: your self-love goes away all
troubled, in stead of thinking that God has permitted this little dryness in
the Superior to mortify your self-love, which seeks that the Superior
should make much of you, receiving amiably what you would say to her; but in
fine, it vexes us to meet with a mortification where we looked not for it.
Alas, we ought to go and pray God for the Superior, blessing him for this
well-beloved contradiction. In a word, my dear daughters, Let us remember the
words of the great Apostle S. Paul: Charity thinks not evil: as if he
would say, that she tourneth her self from seeing it, without thinking
there-on, or staying to consider it.

. 5. Moreover you asked of me touching this point: whether the superior or
directrice ought not to make show of repugnance that the sisters do see her
defects, and what she ought to say when a Religious comes to accuse herself
simply to her* of some judgment or thought that she has had, which noted her
imperfection; as for example if some one have thought that the superior should
have used correction with passion. Now I say, that which she is to do in
this occasion, is to humble her self, and to run to the love of her
abiection* but if the sister was a little troubled in speaking it, the
superior should not make semblance of any thing; but chang the discourse, yet
notwithstanding hide the abiection in her heart. For we ought to take good
head that our self love cause us not to loose the occasion of seeing our
selves imperfect and of humbling our selves* and although they forbear the
exterior act of humility for fear of troubling the poor sister who is
already afflicted enough, they must not omit to make the interior: But if on
the contrary, the sister was not troubled in accuseing her, I should think
it good that the superior did freelye confess that she had failed, if it be
true: for if the judgment he false, it is good she declare it with humility,
notvvithstanding allwaies reserving the abiection pretiously, which comes to
her of this that they judge her defective. You see how this little virtue of
our own abiectio^ ought never to remove one stepp from our heart; because we
have need of it every hour, although we be very perfect, for as much as our
passions will revive, yea sometimes after we have lived in Religion many
years, and have made great progress in perfection: even as it happened to a
Religious of Saint Pachome named Siluain, who in the world was a player by
profession, and being converted became Religious. He passed the year of his
probation, yea many others after, with very exempla^ mortification; they
never having, seen him exercise any act of his first occupation; twenty years
after he thought he might do well to make some merrime^t, under pretense of
recreating his brethren, believing that his passions were already so
mortifyed, that they had no power to make him pass the limitts of a simple
recreation: but the poor man was much deceived, for the passion of joy did so
revive, that after his apish fopperies, he betook himself to dissolutions in
such sort, that they resolved to put him out of the monastery, which they had
done, but that one of his Religious brethren yealded himself pledge for
Siluain, promising that he should amend himself, which he did, and became
after a great Saint. Consider then, my dear sisters, how we must never
forgett what we have been, to the end we become not worse, and let us not
think that we are perfect, when we do not committ many imperfections:
we must also take head not to be troubled if we have passions; for we
shall never be wholy exempt. Those Hermitts who would avovv the contrary,
were censured by the sacred council, and their opinion condemned, and held for
erroneous. We shall therefore always committ some faults; but they ought
so rarely to be committed, that two be not seen in fifty years, even as
there were but two espied in the lenght of time that the Apostles lived, after
they had received the Holy Ghost. Nevertheless if we should see three or
four, yea seven or eight, in so long a succession of years, we should not
therefore be afflicted nor loose courage, but rather take breath, and fortify
our selves to do better.

. 6. Let us speak furthermore one word for the superior; The sisters ought
not to be astonished, although the Superior committ imperfections, since that
Saint Peter, who was the pastor of the whole church, and universal
Superior of all Christians, fell into a defect, and such a one, as he
deserved correction, even as Saint Paul says: Likewise the Superior ought
not to make show of trouble that her faults are seen, but she ought to
observe the humility and gentleness, with which Saint Peter received the
reprehension from Saint Paul, notwithstanding he was his Superior. We know
not which is more worthy of consideration, either the force of the courage of
Saint Paul to reprehend Saint Peter, or the humility wherewith Saint Peter
submitted himself to the correction that was given him by S. Paul; yea for a
thing wherein he thought he did well, and had a very good intention.

. 7. You demand in the fourth place, if i^ should happen, that a Superior had
so much inclination to comply with secular persons, under pretense of
profiting them, that she did omit the particular care, which she ought to
have of the Religious who are under her charge, or else that she had not time
sufficient to execute the affairs of the house, because she would remain too
long at the parloy; if she should not be obliged to cut of this inclination
although her intention were good? I will yeald this to you, that the
Supeperiours ought to be very affable to seculars to profitt them, and they
ought willingly to give them part of their time; but what think you this
little part ought to be? it ought to be the tvvelueth part, the eleauen
remaining to be employed within the house, in the care of the family.

The Bees truly go forth of their hiue, but this is not but for necessity
or profitt, and they remain but little without, retourning back again, and
principally the king of Bees goes but rarely forth, but when he makes a
swarm of Bees that he is inuironned with all his little people. Religion is
a mystical hiue full of celestial Bees, who are assembled together to manage
the honey of celestial virtues, and therefore the Superior, who is amongst
them as their king, ought to be careful to keep them near her, for to teach
them the manner how to attain and conserve these virtues. Notwithstanding, she
must not be wanting to converse with secular persons when necessity or
charity requires it; but further then so, the superior must be breife with
seculars: I say besides necessity and charity, because there are certain
persons of great respect who must not be disgusted. But Religious men and
women must never entertayne themselves with seculars under pretense of
gayning friends to their Congregation. O truly! there is no need of this;
for if they keep themselves within to perform that well which is their
duty, they ought not to doubt but our Lord will provide their Congregation
sufficiently of friends who are necessary for them.

But if it trouble the Superior to break of company when the sign is given
to go to the divine Office, for fear of discontenting those with whom she
conuerseth, she must not be so tender nor fearful; For if they be not
persons of great respect, or otherwise who come not but very rarely, or
who dwell far of, she must not quit the divine Office, nor prayer, if
Charity do not absolutely require it. Touching the ordinary visitts of
persons whom they may freely take leave of, the Portresse should say, that our
mother or sisters are in prayer, or at the Office, if they please to stay, or
come another time. But if it happen for some great necessity they go to the
parloy in these times, at the least let them take time after to remake their
prayer, so much as they may or can possible: for of the Office none doubts
but they are obliged to say it.

. 8. Now in respect of the last question, which is if they ought not always
to yeald some little particularitie to the Superior, more then to the rest of
the sisters, asvvell in garments, as in her diet, it shall soon be resolved,
for in a word I tell you, no; in no sort whatsoever, if it be not of
necessity: eue^ as they do to every one of the sisters, also she must not
have a particular chair, if it be no^ in the Quire, and in the Chapter, and
in this chair the assistant ought never to place her self, although in all
other things they ought to bear her the same respect as to the Superior*
(understand in her absence) In the Refectorie also she must only have a^ seat
as the others* although they all owe her respec^ as to a particular person to
whom they ought to bear a very great reverence, yet she must not be
singular in any thing, as little as she shall be able we* always except
necessity, as if she be old o^ infirm; for then it shall be permitted to give
her a^ chair for her ease. We must carefully avoid all these things which
make us appear so^thing above others, I would say supereminent and
remarkable. The superior ought to be acknowledged and noted for her virtues,
and not for her unnecessary singularities, espetiallie amongst us of the
Visitatio^, who desire to make a particular profession of great simplicity and
humility: The^e honors are good for those Religious houses, where the
superior is called Madame; but for us there must be none of all this.

. 9. What must we do to conserve the spirit of the Visitation well, and
to hinder the dissipation thereof? The only means is, to keep it locked and
enclosed within the observance of her Rules: but you say that there are some
who are so jealous of this spirit, that they would not have it communicated
out of the house: there is an excess in this zeal which must be cut of:
for to what purpose I pray you would you conceal from your neighbor that
which may profitt him, I am not of this opinion, for I would that all the
good that is in the Visitation were acknowledged and knovve^ to every one,
and therefore I have always been of this judgment, that it will be good to
cause the Rule and Constitutions to be printed; to the end that many seeing
them may dravve some profitt thereof. Would to God, my dear sisters, there
might be many found that would practice them, they should see very quickly
a great chang in themselves, which would redound to the Glory of God, and
the salvation of their souls. Let us be very careful to conserve the
spirit of the Visitation, but not in such sort, that the care hinder us from
the communicating of it charitably, and with simplicity to our neighbor, and
to every one according to their capacity, and do not fear that it will be
dissipated by this communication: for Charity never ruinateth any thing but
perfecteth all things.

THE SEAVENTEENTH ENTERTAINMENT.
VVHERE-IN IS DEMAVNDED: HOW, and upon what motive the Religious ought to
give their voice to those that they would admit to Profession, as also to
those they receive into the Nouitiat.
. 1. Two things are requisite for to give their voice so as is befitting such
persons: The first, that they admit such persons, who have a good call from
God. The second that they have requisite conditions for our manner of life.
Touching the first point, that she must have a good vocation from God, to be
received into Religion, you must know, that when I speak of this call and
vocation, I intend not to speak of the general vocation, such as that is by
the which our Lord calls all men to Christianity, nor yet of that whereof
it is said in the Gospel that many are called but fevv elect: For God who
desires to give eternal life to all, gives to them all the means to attain
thereunto, and therefore he calls the^ to Christianity, and has elected them
correspondent to this vocation, follovving the attracts of God, and yet the
number of those who are found therein is very little in comparison of those
who are called. But speaking more particulerlie of a Religious vocation, I
say, that many are well called of God into Religion, but there are fevv who
maintain and conserve their vocation: for they begin well, but are not
faithful to correspond to the divine grace, nor perseuerant in the practice of
that which may conserve their vocation, and make it good and assured. There are
others who are not well called, neuertheless being entered, their vocation
has been ratifyed and made good of God even as we see in those who come
through spleen and discontent into Religion, and although it seems that
these vocations are not good, neuertheless we have seen that these being
entered on such terms, have succeeded very well in the service of God.
Others are incited to entrer into Religion for some disaster and misfortune,
vvhi^h they have in the world, others for want of health or corporal
beauty: and alt^ough that these persons, have motives which of themselves are
not good; notvvithstanding God serves himself of them for to call such
persons. In fine, the ways of God are incomprehensible, and his judgments
inscrutable, and admirable in the variety of vocations, and means which he
uses to call his creatures to his service, to which all honor and reverence
is due.

. 2. Now of this great variety of vocation^ it follovveth, that it is a thing
very difficult to know true vocations, and yet this is the first thing which
is requisite to give their voice well, to wit, if the party proposed be
well called, and if her vocation be good: how then amongst so great a
variety of vocations, and of so different motives, shall we be able to
know the good from the bad and not be deceived? This truly is a matter of
great importance, and is very difficult; notvvithstanding it is not so that
we are altogether destitute of means for to know the goodness of a vocation.
Now amongst many that I could allege, I will speak of one only, as the
best of all. A good vocation is no other thing then a firm and constant will,
that the person called has to serve God, in the manner and in the place to
which his divine Majesty calls her, and this is the best mark that we
can have to know when a vocation i^ good: but note well that when I say a
firm and constant will to serve God, I do not say that she must from the
beginning do all that is to be done in her vocation, with so great a
stabilitie and constancye that she be exempt from all repugnance, difficulty,
or disgust in that which depends thereon* no, I do not say so, much less
that this stabilitie and constancy be such, that it exempteth he^ from
committing faults, nor that therefore she be^ so firm that she never happen to
stagger or vari^ in the entreprise that she has made, to practice the means
which may conduct her to perfection. O^ no truly; this is not that I would
say: for every man is subject to such a passion, alteration, and vicissitude,
that he who this day does love such a^ thing, to morrow will love another,
in such sor^ that one day never resembles another. Then it is not by the
diverse motions and feelings, that we ough^ to judge the stabilitie and
constancy of the will, although we have once embraced it; but if amongs^
this variety of diverse motions, the will remain firm, and quitteth not the
good it has embraced allthough it feel some disgust, or coldness in the love
of some virtue, and that she do not therefore omit to serve her self of the
means, that ar^ appointed her: so that to have a mark of a good vocation, a
sensible constancy is not necessary; bu^ that which is in the superior part
of the spirit which is effectiue, is sufficient. Therefore to know if God
will have us Religious, we must not expect, that he speak sensibly unto us,
or that he send some Angel from heaven to signify his will much less is it
needful to have revelations upon ^his subject; or to make an examine of ten or
^welue Doctors to see if the inspiration be good ^r badd, if it must be
follovved or not. But we ought to correspond well, and cultiuate the first
motion, and then not to be afflicted if disgusts and ^uke-warmnes therein come
upon us: for if we ^llvvaies endeavor to keep our will very constant, ^o
desire and search the good which is manifested unto us, God will not be
wanting to cause all to ^edound to his Glory.

. 3. And when I say this, I do not speak only for you, but more over for
all women that ^re in the world, of whom truly care ought to be ^ad, in
assisting them in their good designs. When ^hey have the first motions a
little strong, nothing ^s difficult unto them, it seems unto them that ^hey
can break through all obstacles. But when ^hey feel these changes, and that
the former gusts ^re no more so sensible in the inferior part, they ^hinke
that all is lost, and that all must be left, they will and they will not:
that which they then feel ^s not sufficient to make them leave the world I
would willingly, says one of these virgins, but I know not if it be the
will of God that I be Religious, for so much as the inspiration that I feel
at this time is not strong enough me thinks. It is true I have had it much
stronger then I have at this time* ^ut because it continues not, it makes me
believe it is not good. Truly when I meet with such souls, I wonder not at
these disgusts, neither do I believe them, that therefore their vocation is
the less good: we must only in this have a great care to assist them, and
learn them not to be astonished at these changes in themselves, encouraging
them to remain constant in these mutations: well, say I, to them, this is
nothing, tell me, have you not felt a motion or inspiration in your heart to
seek^ so great a good? yeas, say they, it is very true, bu^ this quickly
passed: werie well say I to them, the force of this feeling passed, but not in
such sor^ that there remains not in you some affection thereunto: O no,
says she; for I feel alvvaies (...) know not what, which makes me yeald
to the side: but that which troubles me is, that I fee^ not the motion so
strong, as it should be for suc^ a resolution. I aunsvvere them that they must
no^ vex themselves for these sensible feelings, nor examine them so much, but
that they content themse^ues with this constancy of their will, which in the
midst of all this loses not the affection of her fir^ design; Let them
only be careful to cultiua^^ it well, and to correspond well to this first
motion do you not care the^ (say I) of which side it co^met^ for God has many
ways to call his servants an^ handmayds to his service. He uses sometimes
se^mons, other times reading of good books. So^^ have been called by hearing
the sacred words (...) the Gospel, as Saint Francis and Saint Antoni^ who
having heard these words: Go sell all the thou have, and give to the poor
and follovv me^ and whosoever will come after me let him ta^^ up his Cross
and follovv me: left all Others ha^ been called by troubles, disasters, and
affliction which befell them in the world, which gave the^ occasion to set
themselves against it and abando^ it. Our Savior often uses such means to
call ^uers persons to his service, which he could ^gaine in any other sort.

. 4. For although God be Almighty, and o^ all that he will,
notvvithstanding he will not d^priue us of the liberty, that he has once
given (...) and when he calls us to his service, his will (...) that it be
of our free election that we go ther^vnto and not by force or constraint: for
although these do come to God, as spightfull against the world, which has
vexed them, or else because of some labors and afflictions which have
tormented them: yet notwithstanding they omit not to give themselves to God
with a free will: and very often such persons do proceed very well in the
service of God, and become great Saints, and sometimes greater then those, who
have entered into Religion by vocations more apparent. You have read what
Platus recounteth of a brave gentle man according to the world, who one day
being well adorned and frisled, mounted on a fair horse, with a goodly plume
of feathers, endeavoring by all means to please the lady that he courted; as
he braued it, behold his horse threw him backward to the earth in the midst
of the mire and dirt, from whence he came forth all foul and besmired with
dirt; This poor gentleman was so ashamed and confounded with this accident,
that all in a chafe, he resolved in that instant to become a Religious man,
saying: O traitorous world! thou have mocked mec, but I will also mock thee:
thou have played me this trick, but I will play thee another, for I will
never have part with the more, and at this instant I resolve my self to
become a Religious man: and this done he was received into Religion, where
he ledd a holy life, notvvithstanding his vocation came upon a disgrace.

. 5. Furthermore there have been others whose motives have been much more
wicked then this, I have credibly heard that a ge^tleman of our age, of a brave
spirit and body, and very well descended, seeing the Father Capucins to
pass by, said to the other Noble men with whom he was: a desire takes
me to know how these bare footed beggars do live, and to render my self
amongst them, not with a determination to remain allwaies there, but only
for a month or three weeks, the better to mark what they do, for the^
afterward I will be merry, and make iestes upon them with you. He so making
his plot, pursueed it so strongly and firmly that he was in fine received:
but the divine providence, who used this means to dravve him from the world,
converted his end and wicked intention into good, and he that thought to take
others, was taken himself; for he had not remained but some few days with
those good Religious, but he was holy changed, perseuering faythfullie in his
vocation, and has been a great servant of God. There are yet others, whose
vocation in it self is not better then this, that is, of those who go into
Religion because of some natural defect, as being lame, having but one eye, or
being ill favored, or having some other like defect, and moreover that which
appears worse is, that they are carried thither by their parentts, who very
often, when they have children blind, lame or otherwise defective, set them in
a corner at the fire saying, this child is not vvorth any thing for the world,
we must put him or her into Religion, we must procure some benifice for him,
it will be a good discharge for our house: The childere^ permit themselves to
be conducted whither they please, under hope to live of the goods of the
altar: others have a great number of chi^dren, well say they, we must
discharge the house and send these into Religion, to the end the eldest having
all may be of vvorth and make a great show in the world. But God very often
in this demonstrateth the greatness of his clemency and mercy, employing
these intentions, which of themselves are in no sort good, to make these
persons great servants of his divine Majesty, and in this he appears
admirable: So this divine Artisan pleases himself to make beautiful
buildings, with wood that is very crooked, and which has not any appearance
to be proper for any thing in the world: Even as a person who knows not
what ioyners work means; seeing some crooked wood in the ioyners shopp,
would wonder to hear him say that it to make some beautiful peace of work:
for he would say if this be as you say, how oftentimes must the planer pass
over it, before it can be made into such a work? so ordinarily the divine
providence makes beautiful and principal pieces of work with these crooked
and sinister intentions; as he made the lame and blind to enter into his
feast, for to make us see, that to have two eyes and two feet serves for
nothing to go into heaven, and that it is better to go into heaven with one
leg, one eye one arm, then for a man to have two and loose himself. Now
such kind of poeple being thus come into Religion, we see them oftentimes make
great profitt, produce much fruit, and persevere faythfullie in their vocation.

. 6. There are others who have been called very well, who notvvithstanding
have not perseuered; but after they have remained in Religion some time, have
left all, and of this we have an example in Judas, of whose vocation we
cannot doubt but he was well called; for our Lord did choose and called him
to the Apostle-shipe with his own mouth, from whence then came it that being
so well called he did not persevere in his vocation? O this was because he
abused this liberty, and would not use the means which God had given him for
this end; but in lieu of embracing them, and using them for his profitt, he
turned them into abuse; and in doing this he lost himself by rejecting
them; for it is a certain thing, that when God calls any one to a vocation,
he obliges himself consequently by his divine providence, to furnish him
with all requisite helps, to become perfect in his vocation. Now when I say
that our Lord obliges himself, we must not think that it is we, who
have obliged him to do this, in following his vocation; for we cannot oblige
him: but God obliges himself by himself, thrust forward, and provoked to do
this by the entralles of his infinitt goodness and mercy: so that decomming
Religious, our Lord is of himself obliged to furnish me with all that is
necessary for to be a good Religious, not of duty; but through his mercy
and infinite providence: Even as a great king, raising soldiers for war, his
foresight and prudence requires, that he prepare armor to arm them with
all, for what likelihood were it to send them to fight without arms, which if
he do not provide he is taxed of great imprudence? Now the divine Majesty
never wants care, nor foresight touching this: and to make us the better
creditt it he obliges himself thereunto, in such sort that we ought never
to enter into conceat, that there is fault of his part, when we do not well,
yea his liberallitie is so great, that he gives these means to those to whom
he is not obliged because he has not called them. Note also that when I say,
that God is obliged to give to those whom he calls, all the conditions
requsite to be perfect in their vocation, I do not say that he gives them,
to them all at once, at the instant that they enter into Religion, O no! we
must not think that entering into Religion they can be perfect so sodaynlie;
it is sufficient that they come to tend to perfection, and to undertake the
means fit to perfect themselves: and to do this it is necessary to have
this firm and constant will (of which we have spoken) of imbraceing all
means proper for perfecting themselves in the vocation whereunto they be
called.

. 7. Behold therefore how secreat and hidden the judgments of God are, and as
some who for despite, and by way of mockery did enter into Religion,
notwithstanding did persevere well therein: so others being well called, and
having begun with great fervor did make an evil end and leave all: therefore
it is a very difficult thing to know if a women have a good vocation from
God, for to give her your voice; for although we see her fervent it may be
she will not persevere so: but so much the worse for her, you must not
therefore if you see that she has this constant will, to desire to serve God
and perfect her self, deny to give her your voice: for if she will receive the
helps that our Lord will infaillibly give her, she will persevere: but if
after some years she loose perseverance to her damnation, you are not the
cause but her self. And this be spoken for the first part and knowledge of
vocations.

. 8. Touching the second, that is to say, To know what conditions they ought to
have who offer themselves, first those we receive into the house, secondly
those we receive to the Nouitiat, and in the third place, those we receive
to profession. I have little to say about the first reception, for we cannot
know these much, who do come with so good countenance, and outvvard show:
speak to them they will do all we will have them: they resemble Saint
John and Saint James, to whom our Lord said: Can you drink the Chalice of
my passion? They boldly and freely answered I and yet the night of his
passion they left and for sooke him. These women do so, they make so many
prayers, so many Reuerences, they show so much good will that we cannot
well deny them, and in effect in my opinion we need not make very great
consideration thereof. I say this for the interior: for truly it is very
difficult at this time, to be able to know it, principally of those who
come far of; all that we can do to them, is to know who they are, and such
things as regard the temporal and exterior, then open the^ the gate, and put
them to their first trial. If they be of the place where we dwell, we may
observe their behavior, and by the conversation we have with them, come to
know something of their interior: but I find this very difficulte
notvvistanding: for they allwaies come in the best fashion and posture they
can. Now in my opinion for that which concerns their corporal health, and
infirmity of body, there is no necessity of making any great consideration,
for so much as in these houses we may receive the weak and feeble asvvell as
the strong and robust* since they have been built partly for them, provided
that the infirmities be not so great, that they make them wholly incapable of
observing the Rule, and unable to perform that which t^is vocation requires:
but excepting this, I would never refuse them my voice, no not when they
should be blind, or should have but one leg, if with this they should have
the other conditions requisite to this vocation; and let not humayne prudence
say to me, But if such kind of poeple should allwaies be presented, must we
always receive them, and if all were blind or sick who shall serve them?
trouble not your selves with this for it will never arrive: leave this in the
care of the divine providence, who knows well how to provide for it; and
to call the strong necessary for the service of the weak. When the infirm
shall present themselves, say, God be blessed, and when the strong come, in
good time be it. In sum, the sick who hind^r not the observance of the
Rule, ought not to be rejected in your houses. Behold what I had to say to
you touching this first reception.

. 9. Touching the second which is of receiving any into the Nouitiat, I do
not yet find that there are any great difficulties, notvvithstanding we ought
to have more consideration then in their first receiving: for we have had
also more means to note their humors, actions and habitudes, we see well
the passions that they have; but for all this we ought not to hinder them
from being admitted to the Nouitiat, provided that they have a good will to
amend and submitt themselves, and to serve themselves of the medicines proper
for to heal them. And although they have repugnance against these remedies,
and take them with great difficulty, their is nothing to be said to this,
provided that they give not over the practice of them; for medicines are
always bitter to the taste, and it is not possible, that they rece^ue them,
with the sweetness they would do if they were pleasing to the appetite: but
for all this omit not to have their operation; and when they have it it is
better then that they have the more pain and labor* even just as a sister
that has her passions strong; she is choleric, she commits many defects,
if she will be cured of this, and desire that we correct and mortify it, and
that we give her remedies proper for her cu^e, although the taking of them
trouble and vex her, we must not therefore refuse her our voice, for she has
not only a will to be healed: but furthermore she takes the remedies which
are given her for this purpose, although with pain and difficulty. We shall
find those who have been ill bredd, and not trained up in ciuillitie who will
have a rude and lumpish nature: now there is no doubt but these have more
pain and difficulty, then those who have a more sweet and tractable
disposition, and that they will be more subject to committ faults then others
who have been better bredd: but neuertheless if they desire to be well
cured, and by their endeavors witness a firm will to seek and desire to
receive the remedies, although it be to their cost, to such as these I would
give my voice, notvvithstanding these relapses: For these after much labor
produce great fruit in Religion becoming great servants of God, and gayning
strong and solid virtue; for the graces of God supplyeth the defect, and there
is no doubt, that often where there is less of nature, there is more of
grace. Therefore we ought not to refuse to receive such into the Nouitiat
although they have many evil habitts, provided such persons vvil be cured. In
sum to receive one into the Nouitiat there is nothing to be known, but if
she have a good will, and if she be deliberatelie resolved to receive the
usage shall be given her for her cure, and to live in gteat submission; having
this I would give her my voice: Behold! I think this is all that can be
said concerning this second reception.

. 10. For the third it is a thing of great importance, to receive any to
profession, and in this it seems to me we ought to observe three things;
the first that those we receive to profession be sound not of body (as I
have already said) but of heart and spirit, I would say, who have their
heart well disposed to live in an entire flexiblenesse and submission.
Secondly that they have a good spirit; now when I say a good spirit, I
entend not to speak of those great spiritts, who are ordinarily vain, and
full of selfe-iudgments, of imaginary sufficiency, and who in the world
were shopps of vanity, who come into Religion not to humble themselves, but
as if they would read there lessons of Philosophy and Theology, haueing a
will to guide and govern all. Of such as these you must take great heed: I
say there must be good care taken of them, not that they must not be
received, if we see that they vvil be changed and humble themselves: for
they vvil be able in time with the grace of God to make this chang, which
will arrive without doubt, if they use faythfullie the remedies which shall be
given them, for their amendment. Therefore when I speak of a good spirit, I
intend judicious and well made spiritts, and more-ouer of a moderate, temper,
who are not very great nor very little, for such spiritts allwaies do much,
without knovving it themselves. They apply themselves to work, and give
themselves to solid virtues, they are tractable, and we have not much
trouble to guide them: for they easily co^prehe^d how good a thing it is, to
leave themselves to be governed by others. The third thing that is to be
observed is this, if she have labored well in the year of her Nouitiat, if
she have suffered well and profited with the medecines that have been given
her, if she have made much of those resolutions that she promised entering into
the Nouitiat of changing her evil humors and inclinations; for the year of
Nouitiat has been given her for this. If we see she has perseuered
faithfully in her resolution, and that her vill remains firm and constant,
and that she applies her self to reform her self, and behave her self
according to the Rule and constitutions, and that this will endure, yea
always desires to do better, this is a good sign and a good condition,
for to give her your voice: although notvvithstanding she leave not to commit
faults and also great enough, for although in the year of her Nouitiat she
ought to labor for the reformation of her manners and habitts, it is not
therefore to be said, that she must not make any relapse, nor that at the end
of her Nouitiat she ought to be perfect. For behold the College of our Lord
the Glorious Apostles, although they were called well, and had labored much in
the reformation of their lives, how often did they committ faults not only
in the first year* but also in the second and third? all did speak and
promise maruelles, yea even to follow our Lord into prison and death: but in
the night of his passion, when Judas came to take their good Master, all
forsook him. Therefore I will say that falls ought not to be a cause that
we reject one when among all this, she remains with a very strong will to
redress her self, and with a will to help her self by the means which
are given her for this purpose. This is that I had to say touching the
conditions, which those ought to have whom we would receive to profession,
and what the sisters ought to observe to give the^ their voices: hereupon I
will finish my discourse, if you demand not any further question.

. 11. We demand first, if any one be found, who was subject to be troubled
for small matters, and that her spirit was often full of melencholie and
unquietness, and that she did witness by this, little love of her vocation: and
yet notwithstanding this being past; she promises to do marualles; what
should be done to her? it is most certain that such a person, being so
changeable is not proper for Religion: for in this she will not be cureed, we
must give her leave to depart. We do not know, you say, whether this
proceeds from want of will to be cured, or because she does not comprehend
wherein true virtue consists. But if after she has been made to understand
what she ought to do for her amendment, she does it not, but becomes
incorrigible, she must be rejected; especially because her faults as you say,
proceed not for want of judgment, nor of abillitie to comprehend where-in true
virtue consists, much less to know the means she ought to use for her
ame^dment; but it is from the defect of the will which has not perseverance,
nor constancy to execute and serve it self of that which she knows to be
requisite for her amendment, although she say sometimes that she will do better
yet does it not, but perseuereth in this inconstancy of will, I would not give
her my voice. Moreover, you say, there are some so delicate that they cannot
support correction without much trouble, and this makes them often sick: if
this be so, open them the gate; for since they are sick, and will not that we
treat them, nor apply to them the remedies fit for their health, we cleerlie
see that doing so, they will become incorrigible, and give not any hope to be
able to cure them: because this delicacie as well of spirit as of body, is one
of the greatest hindrances which can be in a Religious life, and therefore we
must have an especial care, not to receive such who are vnmeasurably tainted
therewith; because they will not be cured, refusing to use those things, which
are given them for their health.

. 12. Secondly, we demand what we ought to judge of her, who withnesseth by
her words, that she repents her self of entering into Religion? Truly if she
persevere in these disgusts of her vocation and repentance, and that we see
that this makes her remiss and negligent to behave her self according to the
spirit of her vocation, she must be put forth; neuertheless we must consider
that this may happen, either by a simple tentation, or for her exercise and
trial: and this may be known, by the profit she shall make of such
thoughts, disgusts or repentance, when with simplicity she shall discover
her self of such things, and that she vvil be faithful to use the remedies
that shall be given her for itt, for God never permits any thing for our
exercise, but that he would we should dravve profitt thereby, the which is
always done, when we are faithful to discover our selves, and as I have
said, simple to believe and to execute that which is appointed us, and this
is a mark that the exercise is of God: but when we see that this person
uses her selfe-iudgment, and that her will is seduced and corrupted,
perseuering in her disgusts, then her case is in ill estate, and as it were
without remedy: she must be dismissed.

. 13. Thirdly you demand if we ought not to make consideration, of giving
our voice to one that is not cordial, or who is not equal toward all the
sisters, and who has manifested that she has more inclination to one then to
another. We must not be so rigourous for these small matters; Consider that
this inclination is the last piece of our renuntiation: for before we can
arrive to this point, not to have any inclination to one more then to another,
and that these affections be so mortified that they appear not, there must
be time for it. We must observe in this as in all other things, if this
sister is become incorrigible.

. 14. In fine you say, if the opinion of the other sisters, were wholly
contrary to that you know, and that there came an inspiration to you to speak
something that you have known, which is to the advantage of the sisters hold
it be ommitted to be spaken of? no: allthough the conceate of others be
wholly contrary to yours, and that you be only in this opinion: for this
may serve for others to resolve themselves what they ought to do. The Holy
Ghost ought to preceede in the community, and they are to resolve themselves
according to the variety of opinions, for to do as they judge most expedient
for his Glory: Now this inclination that we have that others give their
voice, or that they give it not, although we give, or do not give ours, ought
to be contemned and rejected as another tentation: but we must never make
show among the sisters of our inclinations or auersions in this occasion. In
fine, for all the imperfections that women bring out of the world, this rule
must be regarded; when we see that they amend themselves, although that they
leave not to committ faults, we must not reject them; for by the ame^dment
they make it appear that they will not remain incorrigible.

THE EIGHTEENTH ENTERTAINMENT.
HOW WE OUGHT TO RECEAVE THE Sacraments, and recite the divine Office, with
other points touching prayer.
. 1. BEfore that we know how we ought to prepare our selves to receive the
Sacraments, and what fruit we should receive by the^, it is necessary to
know what the Sacraments and their effects are. The Sacraments then are the
conduits (so to speak) whereby God descends to us, as by prayer we ascend
to him, since prayer is no other thing then an elevation of our spirit unto
God. The effects of the Sacraments are diverse although they have all but one
and the self same end and pretention, which is to unite us with God. By the
Sacrament of Baptism, we unite our selves to God, as the son with the
Father; by that of Confirmation, we unite our selves to him as a soldier with
his Captain, receiving strenght to fight and vanquish our enemies in all
tentations. By the Sacrament of Penance we are united to God as reconciled
friends: by that of the Eucharist, as food with the stomach: by that of
Extreme unction, we unite our selves to God as a child who coming from a
far country, already putting one of his feet into the house of his father,
to reunite himself with him, his mother, and all the family. Now these are
the effects of the Sacraments: but notwithstanding which demand all the vnio^
of our soul with her God. We will speak now but of two of the^, to wit of
Penance, and of the Holy Eucharist. And first it is most necessary, that we
should know wherefore it is, that so often receiving these two Sacraments, we
do not also receive the graces, which they are accustomed to bring to souls
which are well prepared; since these graces are joined to the Sacraments. I
will declare it in a word, it is for want of due preparation, and therefore we
must know how we ought to prepare our selves well to receive these two
Sacraments, and so like-wise all the others.

. 2. Therefore, the first preparation is purity of intention; the second is
attention; the third is hulitie. Touching purity of intention, it is a thing
totallie necessary, not only in the reception of the Sacraments: but further
more in all that we have to do. Now the intention is then pure when we
receive the Sacraments, or do any other thing whatsoever it be, for to unite
us with God, and to be more pleasing to him, without any mixture of proper
interest. You shall know this; if when you desire to communicate, your
Superiors will not permit you, or otherwise if after the holy Communion
you have not had consolation, and notvvithstanding this you remain in peace,
not consenting to the assaults which may come to you: but if contrariwise
you consent to unquietness, because they refuse you to communicate, or because
you have not had consolation, who sees not that your intention was impure
and that you sought not to unite your self to God, but to consolations, since
that your union with God ought to be made under the virtue of holy Obedience?
and even so likewise if you shall desire perfection with a desire full of
unquietness, who sees not that it is self-love, which would not that
others should see imperfections in you? If it were possible, that we could
be as pleasing to God being imperfect as being perfect, we ought to desire
to be without perfection, to the end to nourish within us by this means
most holy humility.

. 3. The second preparation is attention; Truly we ought to go to the
Sacraments with very much attention asvvell for the greatness of the work,
as concerning that which each Sacrament requires of us. For exemple going to
Confession, we ought to carry thither, a heart lovingly dolorous, and to the
holy Communion, we ought to bear a heart ardentlie loving. I do not say by
this great attention that we should not have any distractions, for this is
not in our power; but I intend to say that we must have a very particular
care, not to settle our selves therein willingly.

. 4. The third preparation is humility, which is a virtue very necessary to
receive the graces abundantly, which flow unto us by the conduits of the
Sacraments, because waters are accustomed to glide more swiftly and strongly,
when the conduits are placed in bending places, and tending down-wards.

But besides these three preparations; I desire to speak a word to you about
the principal end of all, which is the total abandoning of our selves to the
mercy of God, submitting our will and all our affection to his dominion
without any reservation. I say without reservation, for so much as our misery
is so great that we always reserve something to our selves. The most
spiritual persons ordinarily reserve to themselves the will of haueing
virtues, and when they go to the holy communion; O Lord, say they, I aba^do^
my self entirely without reseruatio^ into thy hands; but let it please thee
to give me prudence to know how to live honorably, but they never demand
simplicity. O my God! I submitt my self absolutely to thy divine will; but
give me fortitude to thy divine will: but give me fortitude to perform
excellent works for thy service; but of sweetness and mildnes of spirit to
live peaceably with their neighbor, they speak not off at all. Give meee,
will another say, that humility which is proper for to give good example: but
humility of heart which makes us love our own abiection, they have no need
thereof as they think. O my God, since that I am wholly thine let me have
allwaies consolation in prayer. Yea, is this that which is necessary for to
be united with God, which is the pretention that we have? But they never
ask tribulations or mortifications. O! It is not the means to make this
union, to reserve to themselves all these wills, for the fair show that they
make: for our Lord desires to give himself wholy unto us, and his will is
that reciprocally we should give our selves entirely unto him: to the end,
that the union of our soul with his divine majesty might be more perfect,
and that we might be able truly to say, follovving the great Apostles I
live no more in my self, but it is Jesus that lives in me.

. 5. The second part of this preparation consists in emptying our heart of all
things, to the end our Lord himself may wholy replenish it: truly the cause
wherefore we do not receive the grace of sanctification (since that one
only Communion well received, is capable and sufficient to make us holy and
perfect) proceeds not, but of this that we permit not our Lord to reign
in us, as his goodness desires to do. This well-beloved of our souls comes
into us, and he finds our hearts topp full of good affections and desires,
but this is not that which he seeks: for he desires to find them empty,
that he may make himself master and gouerner thereof: And to show how much
he desires it, he says to his sacred spouse, that she should put him as a
seal upon her heart, to the end that nothing might enter there but by his
permission, and according to his good pleasure. Now I know that the midst of
your hearts is empty (otherwise it should be a very great infidelity) I
would say that you have not only rejected, and detested mortal sin; but
all kinds of wicked affections, but alas all the nookes and corners of our
hearts are full of a thousand things, unworthy to appear in the presence of
this Soueraygne King: We seem to bind his hands and to hinder him from
distributing the benefits and graces, which his goodness has desire to
bestow upon us, if he found us prepared. Let us therefore on our part do
what is in our power, to prepare our selves well to receive this
supersubstantiall bread, abandonning our selves totally to the divine
providence, not only for that which concerns temporal goods; but
principally the spiritual, povvring forth in the presence of the divine
goodness, all our affections, desires and inclinations, for to be entirely
subject unto him, and let us assure our selves, our Lord will accomplish on
his part, the promise that he has made of transforming us into himself,
raising our baseness until it be united to his greatness.

. 6. We may communicate well for diverse ends, as to demand of God to be
delivered of some tentation or affliction, be it for our selves or for our
friends, or to beg some virtue, provided it be under this condition, for to
unite us by this means more perfectly unto God, the which arriueth not very
often, for in the time of affliction, we are more ordinarily united unto
God, because we remember him more often. And for as much as concerns
virtues, sometimes it is more to the purpose, and berter for us not to have them
in habitt, then if we had them, provided notvvithstanding that we do acts
of virtue, according to the measure that the occasions do present themselves:
for the repugnance that we feel to practice some one virtue, ought to serve
us to humble our selves, and humility is always more vvorth then all this.
In fine it is necessary that in all the prayers and demands you make to God,
you make them not only for your selves, but that you always observe to say
us, as our Lord has taught us in the Dominicall prayer, where there is
neither me nor mine, nor I; that is to say, that you have intention to pray to
God, that he give the virtue or grace that you ask of him for your self, to
all those that have the same necessity: and let this be allv aies with
intention to unite your self more with him: for otherwise we ought not to
ask or desire any thing, neither for our selves nor for our neighbor, since
this is the end, for which the Sacraments are instituted: therefore we ought
to correspond to this intention of our Lord, receiving them for this end, and
we must not think, that communicating or praying for others, we loose any
thing thereby; except when we offer to God this communion or prayer, for the
satisfaction of their sins: for then we do not satisfy for our own, but
notvvithstanding the meritt of the Communion, and prayer shall remain to us:
for we cannot deserve grace one for the other, there is none but our Savior
who can do it; we may indeed impetrate graces for others; but we are not
able to deserve them. The prayer which we have made for them augmenteth our
merit, as well for the recompense of grace in this life, as of glory in the
other. And if any one did not make her attention to do something for the
satisfaction of her sins, the only attention that she should have, to do
all that she doet^ for the pure Love of God should suffice to satisfy for
them, since it is most assured, that whosoever should be able to make an
excellent act of Charity, or an act of perfect contrition, should satisfy
fully for all his sins.

. 7. You would it may be informed, how you should know, if you do profit by
the means of receiving the Sacraments. You shall know it if you advance your
self in the virtues, which are proper to them; as if you dravve from
Confession the love of your own abiection, and humility: for these are the
virtues that are proper to it, and it is always by the measure of humilie
that we know our advancement; See you not that it is said that whosoever
humbles him self shalb^ exalted; to be exalted is to be advanced. If by the
means of the holy Communion, you become very gentle (since that this is the
virtue which is proper to this Sacrament, which is altogether svveete,
delectable and me^lifluous) you reap the fruit tha^ is proper unto it, and so
you advance your self: but if on the contrary you become not more humble, nor
more gentle, you deserve not your bread, since you will not labor for it.

. 8. I desire very much that when the desire to communicate shall come into
our mind, we go simply to ask it of our Superiors, with resignation to
accept humbly the refusal, if they give it us, and if they grant us our
request, to go to the Cummunion with love, although there be mortification
in the demanding of it, we must no^ therefore omit to do it; for those
who enter into the congregation, enter not there-in but to mortify
themselves, and the Cross which they carry, ought to put the^ in mind
thereof. What if the inspiratio^ did come to some one not to communicate so
often as the others, because of the knowledge she has of her indignity? She
may ask the Superior expecting the judgment she will give, with great
sweetness and humility.

I would also that we did not disquiet our selves, when we hear some
fault that we have, spoken of, or some virtue that we have not, but let us
bless God, because he has discovered to us the means to attain the virtue,
and to correct in our selves the imperfection, and then to take courage to
serve our selves of these means. We ought to have generous spiritts, which
are not fastened but to God only, without any attention to what our
inferior part wills, making the superior part of our soul to reign,
since it is entirely in our power with the grace of God never to consent to
the inferior. Consolations and tendernesses ought not to be desired, since
that this is not necessary unto us to love our Lord the more. Therefore it is
not necessary to pause and consider if we have good feelings: but we must
do that which we would do if we had them. Also it is not necessary to
be so Scrupulous to desire to confess so many small imperfections, since that
we are not obliged to confess us of venial sins at all if we will not:
but when one confesses them, he ought to have a resolute will to amend: it
vvil be otherwise an abuse to confess them. Likewise we must not torment
our selves when we do not remember our faults to confess them: for it is
not credible, that a soul that makes her often examine; does not
sufficiently enough remember her self of those faults that are of
importance. As for so many small and light faults, you may speak with our
Lord about them every time that you perceive them, one humiliation of spirit,
one sigh suffices for this.

. 9. You ask how you may make your act of Contrition in little time, I tell
you that there is almost no necessity of time to do it well: since it is no
other thing then to prostrate ones self before God in the spirit of humility
and repentance for having offended him. Secondly you desire that I speak to
you of the divine Office: I will willingly; and first I say to you, that
we ought to prepare our selves to say it, from that instant that we hear
the bell that calls us thereunto, and we ought in imitation of Saint
Bernard, to ask of our heart what it is that it goes to do; and not only
in this occasion, bu^ also in the entrance to all our exercises, to the en^
we may carry to every one of them, the spirit that is proper for it; for it
will be to no purpose to go to the Office as to recreation; for to recreatio^
vee must bear a spirit amorouslie joyful; and to the Office a spirit
seriously loving; when vve^ say: Deus in adiutorium meu^ intend; we mus^
think that our Lord reciprocallie says to us: An^ be you attentive to me:
Let those who understand somevvhat of that which they say in the Office,
employ faythfullie this talent according to the good pleasure of God, who has
given it to help them to keep themselves recollected, by the means of the
good affections they may dravv^ thereof; and let those who do not
understand keep themselves simply attentive to God, or el^^ make darting
amourous desires, vvhiles the other Quier fayeth the verse, and they make the
pause^ It ought also to be considered, that we do the same office as the
Angels, although in diverse language; and that we are before the same God
before whom the Angels tremble, and even as man who did speak to a king,
should becom^ very attentive, fearing to committ some fault; b^ if
notvvithstanding all his care, he did happen t^ fail, he would blush
incontinently: so likevvi^^ ought we to do in the Office, standing upon ou^
gaurd, fearing to fail: More-ouer it is requisite, t^ have attention to
pronunce well, and to say as it (...) ordained, above all in the beginning:
but if vve^ happen to committ some defect therein, we mu^^ humble our selves
for it without astonishmen^ since it is no strange thing, for we do it
elsewhere but if we happen to do it many times, and tha^ this continue,
there is a sign that we have no^ conceived a true displeasure of our first
fault; an^ it is this negligence which should bring us very much confusion,
not because of the presence of the Superior; but for the respect of God, and
of his Angels who are present with us. Now it is almost a general rule,
that when we committ so often one and the self same fault; it is a sign
we want affection to amend it, and if it be a thing vvhere-of we have
been oftentimes advertised, there is appearance that we neglect the
aduertisment.

. 10. More-ouer you ought not to have a scruple of omitting in the whole
office two or three verses by mistake, provided that you did it not of
purpose, but if you slumber a good part of the office, although you say your
verses on your quire, you are obliged to say it again; but when you do
things that are necessary to be done in the Office, as to cough or to spitt,
or that the Mistress of the ceremonies speaks for matter of the office, then
you are not obliged to say it again.

When they enter into the Quire, the Office being begun, they must place
themselves in their rank with the others; and follovv on the Office with
them, and after that it is said, you must retake that which the Quire had
said before you were there, ending where you had taken it; if not you must
say with a low voice, that which the Quire has said, then having overtaken
it, continue therevvith in case your assistance there be truly necessary.
You must not say your Office again for having been distracted in saying of it,
provided it be not, voluntary and althoug you should find your selves at the
end of some psalm not being well assured that you have said it because that
you have been dist^acted not thinking there-on, omit not to pass forvvard
humbling your selves before God; for we must not always think that we
hau^ been negligent when the distraction has bee^ long; for it may very
well be it will endure the length of an Office without any fault of ours*
and how bad soever it were we should no^ be troubled; but make simple
refusalls of it from time to time before God: I desire that we should never
be troubled for the bad motions that vv^ have, but that we faythfullie and
courageously employ our selves not to consent thereunto, sinc^ there is very
great difference betvveene, to feel and to consent.

. 11. You desire that I speak something o^ prayer; many are very much
deceived, believing that much method is necessary to do it well, an^ they
trouble themselves to find out a certain ar^ which they think is necessary
to be known therein, never ceasing to subtilize, and pry about their prayers
to see how they have made them, o^ how they shall be able to do it according
to their likeing, thinking they must not cough nor move dur^ing the time, for
fear that the spirit of God with dravve it self. A very great folly
truly; as if the spirit of God were so nice, that it depended of the method
and countenance of those who pray; I do^ not say that we must not use those
methodes vvhic^ are appointed us; but we ought not so tie ou^selues unto
them, as those do who never think^ they have made their prayer well; if they
have no^ made their considerations before the affection that our Lord gives
them, which is notvvithstanding the end for the which we make
considerations; such persons resemble those who findein^ themselves in the
place vvhither they pretended t^ go, return back again because they are
no^ come by the way that has been taught them; Neuertheless it is requisite
we behave our selue^ (...) great reverence speaking to the divine Majesty
since the Angels who are so pure tremble in his presence: but good God! will
some souls say, I cannot allwaies have this feeling of the presence of God,
which causes so great an humiliation to the soul, nor this sensible
reverence, which annihilateth me so sweetly and acceptably before God: Now it
is not of this that I entend to speak, but of that which the superior part,
and the topp of the spirit works, houlding it self abject, and in humility
before God, in acknowledgme^t of his infinitt goodness and our profou^nd
littleness and indignity.

. 12. We must also have a great resolution, never to aba^don prayer, for any
difficulty that may be found there-in, nor to go with any preoccupation of
desires, to be comforted and satisfied there-in: for this will not be to
yeald our will united and joined to that of our Lord, whose will is that
entering to prayer we be resolved to suffer the pain of continual
distractio^s, dryness and disgust which shall come upon us there-in, remaining
as constant as if we had had much consolation and tra^quillitie, since it is
certain that our prayer shall not be less acceptable to God nor less
profitable to us, for being made with more difficulty: provided that we
always place justly our will with the will of the divine Majesty
remaining in a simple atte^tio^, and disposition to receive the euets of his
good pleasure with love, be in it prayer, or other occurra^ces: he will cause
that all things shall be profitable to us, and acceptable to his divine goodness.
Therefore this shall be to pray well, my dear daughters, to keep your selves
in peace and tranquillity near our Lord, or in his sight without any other
desire, or pretentio^ but to be with him, and to content him.

. 13. The first method the^ for to entertayne our selves in prayer, is to take
some point, as the mysteries of the death, Life and passion of our Lord, the
which are the most profitable; and it is a very rare thing, that we cannot
be able to profit by the consideration of that which our Lord has done, who
is the sovereign Master, whom the eternal Father has sent into the world to
teach us what we ought to do: and therefore besides the obligation that we
have, to form our selves according to this divine model, we ought to be
very exact to consider his actions, for to imitate them, because it is one of
the most excellent intentions that we can have, for all whatsoever we do,
to perform it because our Lord has done it, that is to say, to practice
virtues, because that our Father has practiced them, and as he has practiced
the^; The better to comprehend this, we ought faythfullie to ponder; see, and
consider them in prayer; for the child that loves his Father well has a great
affection to conform himself to his humors, and to imitate him in all that
he does. That which you say is true, that there are souls, who cannot settle
themselves, nor busy their spiritts upon any mystery, being drawn to a
certain sweet simplicity, which houldeth them in great tranquillity before
God, without any other consideration, then to know that they are before him,
who is all their good* they may remain so profitably, and this is good* but
generally speaking, we ought to provide that all the sisters begin by the
method of prayer, which is the most sure, and which carries them to the
reformation of life and ma^ners, which is this we speak of, which is made
about the mysteries of the Life and death of our Lord; there we walk in
security. Therefore we ought to apply our selves sweetly and simply about
our Master to learn that which he would we should do, and likewise those
that can use their imagination ought to do it; but it must be used soberlye,
very simply and breiflie. The holy Fathers have left many pious and devout
considerations, which we may use for this subject, for since the great sancts
and holy men have composed them, who shall dare to refuse piouslie to believe
that which they have piouslie believed? We must go assuredly after these
persons, of so great authority: But not contenting themselves with that
which they have left; many men have made numbers of other imaginations, and it
is of these whereof we must not serve our selves for meditation, for so much
as it may be prejudicial.

We ought to make our resolutions in the fervor of prayer, when the sun
of justice shines upon us and inciteth us by his inspiration. I will not say
therefore, that we must have great feelings and consolations, although when
God gives them us we are obliged to make our profitt of them, and to
correspond to his love, but when he does not give them us, we ought not to
want fidelity; but to live according to reason and the divine will, and to
make our resolutions with the point of our spirit and superior part of our
soul, not omitting to effectuate and putt them in practice for any dryness,
repugnance or contradiction that can or may present it self. Behold then
here, the first manner of meditating, which many great saints have
practiced, which is very good when it is made as it ought.

. 14. The Second manner of meditaeting is, not to use the imagination; but to
hold themselves to the foot of the Letter, that is to say, to meditate
purelie and simply the Gospel, and the mysteries of our faith, entertayning
themselves familiarlie and very simply with our Lord; of that which he has
done and suffered for us, without any representation. Now this manner is much
more high and better the^ the first, and so it is more holy and more assured,
wherefore we ought to be carried easily by the least attract that we
have thereunto; obserueing every degree of prayer, to keep our spirit in
holy liberty, for to follovv the lights and motions that God will give us;
But for other kinds of prayer more elevated, unless that God send them
absolutely, I pray you that you undertake them not of your self, and without
the advice of those who guide you.

LIVE JESUS.
THE NINETEENTH INTERTAINEMENT.
UPON THE VERTVES OF Saint Joseph.
1. THe just man is made like to the Palm Tree, as the holy Church causes us
to sing in every feast of holy Confessors. But as the palm tree has a
very great variety of particulier properties above all other trees, as being
the prince and king of trees, as well for the beauty as goodness of his fruit:
even so there is very great variety of Justice, although that all the just
be just, and equal in Justice: notvvithstanding there is a great
disproportion betvveene the particular acts of their Justice: even as the
garment of the Patriarch Joseph does represent unto us, which was long even
unto the heels, imbrodered with a goodly variety of flovvers: every just
man has a garment of justice, which covers: him even to the heels, that is
to say, all the powers and faculties of his soul are covered with justice,
and his interior and exterior represent no other thing then justice it self,
being just in all his actions and motions, asvvell interior as exterior; but
notvvithstanding it must be confessed that every garment is embrodered with
variety of diverse fair flovvers, whereof the inequallitie makes them not
the less delightful, nor less commendable. The great Saint Paul the Hermitt
was just with most perfect justice, and yet neuertheless, it is not to be
doubted, that he did never exercise so much Charity toward the poor as
Saint John, who therefore was called the Almes-giuer, nor had he ever the
occasions to practice Magnificence, and therefore he had not this virtue in so
high a degree as many other Saints: he had all virtues, but some of them not
in so high a degree as the others: the Saints have excelled some in one virtue,
others in another, and although they are all Saintcts yet very differentlie,
there being as much difference in Sainctitie as there is in Saints. This
therefore being presupposed, I note three particular properties that the
Palm Tree has among all others, which are in very great number; which
properties appertain best to the Saint whose feast we celebrate, who is (as
the holy Church ordayneth us to say) like to the Palm tree. O what a Saint
is the glorious Saint Joseph: who is not only a Patriark, but the chief of
all the Patriarcks; he is not simply a Confessor but more then a Confessor:
for in his Confession are contained the dignities of Bishops, the generositie
of Martyrs, and of all the other Saints. Therefore it is with just reason
that he is compared to the Palm Tree which is the king of trees, and which
has the property of virginity, of humility, and of constancy and valor.
Three virtues vvhere-in the Glorious Saint Joseph has exceedingly excelled,
and if we durst make comparisons, there would be many who would
mayntaine that he passed all the other Saints in these three virtues. Among
the Palms is found the male and feemale. The male bears not fruit, and
nevertheless he is not unfruitful, for the Palm female would not bear
fruit without him and his aspect: in such sort that if the Palm female be
not planted near to the male-Palme tree and in his aspect, she remains
unfruitful, and bears not dates, which is her fruit; and on the contrary if
she be regarded of the male Palm and be in his aspect, she produces and
brings forth much fruit, but notvvithstanding she produces it virginallie,
for she is not touched of the male, though he look on her there is no union
made betvveene them, and though she produce her fruit in the shadovve and
aspect of her Palm, yet this is very purelie and virginallie; The male Palm
tree contributeth nothing of his substance for this production, neuertheless
none can say, that he has not a great part of the fruit in the Palm female,
since without him she should not bear, but remain barren and unfruitful.
God having from all eternity in his divine providence decreed, that a virgin
should conceive a son, which should be God and man together,
notvvithstanding would that this virgin should be married; but o God! For
what reason say the Holy doctors did he ordain two so different things,
to be a virgin and married together. The greater part of Fathers say, that this
was to free our Bl. Lady of the calu^niations of the Jews, who had not
exe^pted our Lady from calu^nie and reproach but themselves, would have become
examiners of her purity, and that to conserve this purity and virginity, it
was necessary that the divine providence should co^mitt her to the charge,
and into the guard of a man who was a virgin, and that this virgin might
conceive, and bring forh this svveet fruit of life our Lord Jesus, under the
shadovve of holy Marriage. Saint Joseph was then as a Palm tree, who not
bearing fruit, notvvithstanding is not unfruitful; but has a great part* in
the fruit of the female Palm, not that Saint Joseph contributed any thing, to
this holy and Glorious production, but the only shadovve of Marriage, which
did free our Lady and Glorious Mistrise from all sorts of calumnies, and
censures, that her being big with child might have caused her, and although
he did contribute nothing of his, he had notvvithstanding a great part in
this most holy fruit of his sacred spouse: For she did appertain unto him,
and was planted near unto him, as a glorious Palm near to its well-beloved
Palm Tree; who according to the order of the divine providence could not, nor
ought not to have produced but under his shadovve and by his aspect, I would
say, under the shadovv of holy marriage that they had contracted together, a
marriage that was not, according to the ordinary fashion, so much for the
communication of exterior goods, as for the union and conjunction of interior
goods* O what a divine union was there betvveene our Blessed Lady and Saint
Joseph! a union which did cause this tresure of eternal riches, which is our
Lord to be and appertain to the glorious Saint Joseph, even as he did
appertain to our BL. Lady not according to the nature that he had taken in
the bowels of our Glorious Mistress, (nature which had been framed by the Holy
Ghost of the Most pure blood of our B L. Lady) but according to grace, which
made him become participant of all the goods of his dear spouse, and the
which did cause that he went meruelouslie increasing in perfection, and this
by the continual conversation that he had with our Bl. Lady, who did
possess all virtues in so high a degree, that no other pure creature can be
able to attain thereunto: Notvvithstanding Saint Joseph was the man who did
nearest approach to her; and eue^ as we see a looking-glass opposed to the
beams of the sun, receive the beams most perfectly, and another
looking-glass being put just against that which receaueth the beams, although
the latter looking glass take not or receive the beams from the sun but by
reflectio^, notvvithsta^ding it represents the^ so lively, that we cannot
almost judge which it is that receaueth the^ immediately from the sun,
either that which is opposite to the su^ne, or that which receaueth them by
reuerberatio^: of like sort was it in our Bl. Lady, who was as a pure
mirror, opposed to the beams of the sun of Justice, beams that did bring
into her soul all virtues in their perfection, perfectio^s and virtues, which
did make so perfect a reflection in S. Joseph, that almost it seemed that he
was as perfect, or that he had the virtues in as high a degree, as the
glorious virgin our Mistress had them.

. 2. But in particular (to retain us in our matter begun) in what degree had
he virginity think we, which is a virtue that makes us become like
Angels? If the holy virgin was not only a virgin most pure and white; but
(as the holy Church sings in the Response of the Lessons at Mattins) holy
and immaculate virginity ccc. She was virginity it self, how much think
we did he excel there-in, whose charge from the eternal father was to
be guardian of her virginity; or to say better, companion, since that she had
not any need to be guarded by any other then her self, how excellent say I,
ought he to be in this virtue? They had both of them vowed to keep
virginity all there life time, and behold God will that they be united by
the band of a holy Marriage, not for to make them vnsaye and repent them of
their vow, but for to reconfirme them, and to fortify one the other to
persevere in their holy enterprise; wherefore they did renew it, vovving to
live virginally together all their life. The spouse in the Canticle of
canticles uses admirable terms, for to discribe the bashfulnes or
shamefastnes, the chastity, and most innocent ca^dor of his divine lover with
his dear and well-beloved spouse. He says thus; Our sister this little young
virgin, alas! that she is little, she has no breasts, what shall we do to
her in the day that she must be spoken unto? if she be a wall, let us build
upon it bulwarks of silver, and if she be a gate or door, let us join it
together with boords of Cedar to strenghthen it, or with some incorruptible
vvood. Behold how the divine spouse speaks of the purity of the most holy
Virgin: of the Church; of the devout soul: but principally this is addressed
to the most holy Virgin, who was this divine Sun^mite by excellency, above
all others. Our sister, she is little, she has no breasts: that is to say, she
thinks not of marriage, for she has neither breasts nor care therefore. What
shall we do to her in the day she is to be spoken unto? what means this?
In the day she is to be spoken unto? Does not the divine spouse speak unto
her alvvaies when it pleases him? In the day she shall be spoken unto; to wit,
of the principal word, that is when we speak to maids of their marriage:
for so much as it is a word of importance, since it is in their choice to make
election of a vocation and estate, vvhere-in they must always remain; if
she be a door, we will double it or cover it over with boords of Cedar
that is an incorruptible vvood, to make it stronger. The most Glorious virgin
was a tower compassed with very high walls, within the which enclosure the
enemy could not enter, nor any kind of other desires then of liueing in
perfect purity and virginity: what shall we do to her? For she is to be
vvedded, he who has given her this resolution of virginity haueing so
ordained it? If she be a tovver or wall, let us fasten upon it bulvvarks of
silver, which in steed of beating down the tower shall fortify it more:
what is then the Glorious Saint Joseph, but a strong bulvvarke, which has
been ordained over our Blessed Lady? since being her spouse she was subject
to him, and he had care of her; Therefore Saint Joseph was not appointed
over our Bl. Lady, for to make her break her vovv of virginity, but
contrariwise he was given her for a companion thereof, and to the end that
the purity of our Lady might more admirably perseuered in its integrity,
under the veil and shadovv of Marriage, and of the holy union they had
together. If the most holy virgin be a door (says the eternal father) we
will not have it opened, for it is the oriental gate, whereby none can enter
nor go forth, but contrariwise it must he doubled and fortified with
incorruptible vvodde, that is to say, give her a companion in her purity,
which is the great Saint Joseph, who ought for this office to surpass all
the Saints, yea the Angels, and the Cherubins themselves in this so
recommendable virtue of virginity, a virtue which made him become like to a
Palm tree, as we have said.

. 3. Let us pass to the second property and virtue that I find in the Palm,
I say to my purpose, that there is made a just resemblance and co^formitie
betvveene Saint Joseph and the Palm tree in their virtue, which is no other
then holy humility, for althoug that the Palm, be the prince of trees, it
is notvvithstanding the most humble; the which it witnesses in this, that it
hides his flovvers in the spring time, when all other trees set them forth
to the shevve, and lets them not appear but in the great heates. The Palm
keeps itt flovvers within pouches or purses which are made in form of
sheaths, or sizzarcases, which does represent very well unto us the
difference of souls who tend to perfection, from others, and the presence of
the just from those who live according to the world; for the worldlings and
earthly men, who live according to the Laws of the earth, as soon as they
have some good thought, or some good cogitation, which in their opinion is
worthy to be esteemed or if they have some virtue, they are never in rest,
until such time as they have manifested it, and made it known to all those
they meet vvithall; vvhere-in they run the same hazard, that the trees that
are forvvard to budd forth their flovvers in the spring time, as the Almonde
trees are; for if peradventure the frost overtake them, they perish and bear
no fruit: these worldly men who are so light to make their flovvers bloome
and sprout out, in the spring of this mortale life, by a spirit of pride and
ambition, always are in danger to ru^ne hazard to be taken by the frosts,
which makes them loose the fruit of their actions: contrari^^se the just
should always all their flovvers close-vvithin the case of most holy
humility and permit them not to appear as much as they can, until the great
heates, when that God the divine sun of Justice, shall come povverfullie to
vvarme their heart in eternal life; where they shall bear for ever the
svveete fruit of felicity and immortality. The Palm permits not its
flovvers to be seen, until such time as the vehement heat of the sun come
to make its sheaths, cases, or buggetts vvherin they are enclosed to cleave or
riue asunder, after the which its fruit appears suddenly to the view: in
like manner does the just soul: for she keeps her flowers, that is to say
her virtues, hidden under the veil of holy humility until death, wherein
our Lord causes them to be disclosed, and lets them appear outvvardlie,
for so much as the fruits are not to withhould there appearance long after. O
how excellently faithful heerin was this great Saint of whom we speak!
it cannot be sufficiently declared according to its perfection, for
notwithstanding being such as he was, in what poverty, and in what abiection
did he not live all the time of his life? under the which poverty and
abiectio^, he kept hidden and covert his great virtues and dignities; but
what dignities my God? to be governor of our Lord, and not only this, but
furthermore to be his supposed father, and to be the spouse of his most holy
Mother; O truly I doubt not at all that the Angels ravished with admiration
did come in troops after troops to consider him, and to admire his humility,
when he did retain this dear child in his poor shopp, where he labored
in his trade, to nourish the son and the Mother who were committed to him.
There is no doubt, my dear sisters, but that Saint Joseph was more valiant
then David, and had more wisdom then Solomon: Notvvithstanding behoulding him
reduced unto the exer^ise of a carpenter, who could have judged so much of him,
if he had not bee^ illuminated with celestial light? so fast did he shut up
and keep all the si^guler gifts, wherewith God had gratified him: for what
wisdom had not he, since that God gave him in charge his most glorious son,
and that he was chosen to be his governor? If the Princes of this world
have so much care, as being a matter of importance, to give to their children
gouerners who are most capable, then God being able to make that the gouerner
of his son, should be the most accomplished and co^pleat man of the world in
all perfectio^s, according to the dignity and excellency of the thing
governed, which was his most glorious son, the universal prince of heaven
and earth: how should it be, that haueing power to do it, he would not,
or has not done it? Therefore there is no doubt, but that Saint Joseph was
endovved with all the graces and gifts, which did deserve the office that the
eternal father vvvould impose upon him, giueing him the temporal, and
domestical stevvardshipp of his son, and conduct of his family, which was
composed but of three, which does represent unto us the mystery of the most
holy and most adored Trinity: not that there is any comparison, but in that
which respects our Lord, who is one of the Persons of the most holy Trinity:
for touching the others they are creatures: but no^withsta^ding we may say
even so, That it is a Trinity on earth, which in some sort does represe^t the
most holy Trinity, Marie, Jesus and Joseph: Joseph, Jesus, and Marie: a
Trinity meruelouslie reco^mendable and worthy to be honored. You understand
the^ how exceedingly the dignity of S. Joseph was exalted, and how
excelle^tlie he was replenished with all sorts of virtues, On the other side
you see neuert^elesse, how much he was brought low and humbled, more then an
be declared or imagined. This one example suffices for the better
understanding of it; he took his journey toward his own country, and unto
his town of Bethlem, and none is refused of all lodging but himself (at
least that we know of) so that he was constrained to retire himself, and
to lead his chaste spouse into a stable among the oxen and asses: O into what
extremity was his humility and abiection reduced! his humility was the
cause (even as S. Bernard explicateth it (that he thought upon leaving our Bl.
Lady, when he savve her great with child: For Saint Bernard says that
he made this discourse within himself, What means this? I know that she
is a virgin, for we have made a vovv together to keep our virginity and
purity, wherein she would in no sort be wanting, notwithstanding I see
that she is great with child, and that she is a Mother, how can it be that
maternitie is found in virginity and purity, and that virginity does not
hinder Maternitie. O God? (said he to himself) it may be this is that
Glorious virgin, of whom the Prophets do assure us, that she shall conceive
and be the mother of the Messiah? O? If this be of, God forbidd that I should
remain with her, I that am so unworthy of it; it will be much better that I
secreetlie forsake her because of my indignity, and dwell not any longer in
her company: this was a feeling of an admirable humility, and the which did
make S: Peter to cry out in the vessel, where he was with our Lord, when
he did see his Almigthie power manifested in the great draught of fishes that
he took, at his only commandment, willing them to cast their netts into
the sea: O Lord (said he (being wholly tra^sported, with the like feeling of
humility as Saint Joseph) with draw they self from me: for I am a sinful
man, and therefore I am not worthy to be with thee: I know well (would he
say) that If I cast my self into the sea I shall perish: but thou who art
Allmighty can walk upon the waters without danger: for this ^ause I beseeth
thee to retire from me, and not that I withdraw my self from thee: If Saint
Io^eph were so careful to shutt up all his virtues under the shadow of most
holy humility, he had ^ most particular care to hide the precious pearl of
^is virginity; this was the cause he consented to ^ee married, to the end that
none might know it, and because that under the holy veil of marriage ^ee could
live unknown: whereby virgins, and those who will live chastely are taught
that it is not sufficient for them to be virgins, unless they be humble, and
shut up their purity within the pre^ious box of humility: for otherwise it
wlll happen unto them as it did to the foolish virgins, who for vva^t of
humility and merciful Charity, were repelled from the Marriage of the spouse,
and therefore were constrained to go to the wedding of the world, where the
council of the Celestial spouse is not observed who says that he who will
enter to the Marriage feast must be humble, I would say that he must practice
humility: for (says he) going to a wedding, or being invited to a Marriage,
take the last place; wher-in we see how necessary humility is for the
conservation of virginity, since undoubtedly not any one shall be at the
celestial banquet and Nuptial feast which God has prepraed for virgins in
the eelestiall habitation, unless that he shall be accompained with; this
virtue. We do not keep precious things, ^ especially odoriferous ointments
in the air, for not only these sweet savors would euaporate themselves,
but moreover the flies would corrupt them, and make them loose their price and
worth: in like manner the souls of the Just fearing to loose the price and
valor of their good works, shut or lock them up ordinarily in a box, but
not in a common box, no more then precious ointments; but in a box of
Allabaster (such as S. Marie Magdaleine powered forth, (or emptied) upon the
sacred head of our Savior, when that he reestablished her in virginity, not
essential but repared, the which is sometimes more excellent being acquired and
re-established by penance, then that which haueing not received blemish is
accompained with less humility! This Allabaster Box then is humility, within
the which we ought in imitation of our Bl. Lady and Saint Joseph to lock
up our virtues, and all that which may make us to be esteemed of men,
contenting our selves to please God, and to remain under the sacred veil of
the abiection of our selves, expecting the time (as we have said) when God
comeing to dravve us into the place of security, which is his Glory, himself
cause our works to appear for his honor and glory. But what more perfect
humility can be imagined the^ that of Saint Joseph? (I except that of our
Bl. Lady: for we have already said, that Saint Joseph did receive a great
increase in all virtues by way of reflection, of those that the most holy
virgin did imprint in him.) he had a very great part in that divine treasure
that he had near him, which was our Lord and Master, and yet for all that
he so humbled and abased himself, that it seemed not that he had any part in
him, yet notvvithsta^ding he did appertain to him more then to any other,
next to the most holy Virgin; and none may doubt there of, find he was of
his family, and the son of his spouse who did appertain unto him. I am
accustomed to say, that if a dove (to make the comparison more conform to the
purity of the Saint of who^ I speak) should carry a date in his beck, and
let it fall into a garden, would we not say that the Palm which should come
of it, did appertain ^o him who did owe the garden? now if this be so,
who can doubt, that the holy Ghost haueing let ^all this divine Date, as a
divine Dove, into the enclosed and locked garden of the most holy virgin, (a
garden sealed and environed on every side with the hedges of the holy vow
of virginity, and all immaculate chastity) who did appertain to the glorious
Saint Joseph, as to her husband, who shall doubt I say, or who can say that
this divine Palm Tree, which bears the fruit that nourishes to
immortality, does not appertain wholly to this great Saint Joseph? who
notvvithstanding is not therefore the more puffed up, nor become ^eth the more
proud, but rather becomes allwaies the more humble? O God! what a goodly
fight was it to behold the reverence and respect, wherevvith he did converse
asvvell with the mother as with the son. If he had a desire to leave the
mother, not knowing at that time the greatness of her dignity, into what
profound annihilation and humiliation of himself was he afterward brought,
when he savve himself so much honored, that our Lord and our Lady did
yeald themselves obedient to his will, and did nothing but by his
commandment? this is a thing that cannot be comprehended; therefore it is
necessary that we pass to the third property that I note to be in the
Palm, which is valor, constancy, and strength, virtues that are found in a
very eminent degree in our Saint.

. 4. The Palm has strength and valor, and likewise a very great
constancy, above all other trees, also it is the chief of all. The Palm
shows his strength and constancy in this, that the more its laden, the
higher it rises, and becomes more high, the which is very contrary not
only to all other trees, but to all other things, for the more they be
laden, the more they bow down toward the earth; but the Palm shows
his strenght and constancy, in not submitting it self, nor ever bowing down
for any burden they can put upon it, for it is its instinct to mount vpvvards,
and therefore it does so, none being able to hinder it: it shows its valor
in this, that its Leaves are made like svvords and seems to have as many
svvords to fight as it bears leaves; it it truly with very just reason
that Saint Joseph is said to resemble the Palm: for he was always very
valiant, constant, and perseuerant. There is much difference betvveene
constancy and perseverance, strenght and valor; we call a man constant,
who keeps himself, firm, and prepared to suffer the assaults of his
enemies, without astonishment or loosing courage during the combatt: but
perseverance regards principally a certain interior vexation or irksomnes,
which arriueth to us in the lenght of our pains, which is one of the
povverfullest enemies that we can encounter vvithall, now perseverance
makes a man to contemn this enimye, in such sort that he remains
victorious by a continual equallitie, and submission to the will of God.
Courage is that which makes a man valia^tlie resist the assaults of his
enemies: but valor is a virtue which causes, that we are not only ready
to fight, nor to resist when occasion presents it self, but, that we assault
the enemy at the same time he looks not for it. Now our Glorious Saint
Joseph was endued with all these virtues, and he did marvelously well
exercise them: for as concerning his constancye, how much I pray you did he
make it appear, when seeing our Blessed Lady great with child, and not
knovving how this could be, (My God what distress, what anguish, what pain
did he not feel? notwithsta^d^^g he complained not, he was not more
vnci^^ll, nor more displeased toward his spouse, nether ^^d he treat her the
worse for this, remaining as ^vveet and respective in his behavior as he had
^ont to be. But what valor and what force did ^ee not vvitness in the
victory that he boore away against the two greatest enemies of man the
devil and the world? and this by the most exact practice ^f profound humility
as we have noted in the ^hole course of his life. The devil is such an eni^ie
of humility, because the want he had thereof, ^as it that expelled him out
of heaven, and thrust ^im into hell (from whence humility would have ^ept him,
if he had chosen it for his inseparable co^^anion) that there is no invention
nor art, where-of ^ee serves not himself to make a man fall from his virtue,
and so much the more, because as he ^noweth; it is a virtue which makes him
become ^^finitely pleasing to God, so that we may well say, ^aliant and strong
is the man, who like Saint Io^eph perseuereth therein, because that he
remains ^n absolute co^querour of the devil and the world, which is filled
with ambition, vanity, and Pride. Touching perseverance contrary to this
interior ^nimye, which is the anxietie, which comes upon us in the
continuation of abject, humbling, and paynfull things, of evil fortunes, if
we may ^o say, or else in diverse accidents that happen unto us; O how was this
Saint proved of God and men, even in his journey! The Angel commanded him to
depart speedily, and to carry our Lady and her most dear son into Egypt,
behold ^ee departs in an instant without speaking a word, he inquired not
whither shall I go, what ^way shall I take? wherewith shall we be
mayn^ained: who will receive us there? he departed at adventure with his
tools on his back, for t^ gain his poor living and his families with the
sweat of his brows; O how much might this anxietie where-of we speak have
troubled him, especially seeing the Angel had not told him how long he
should be there, so that he could no^ settle any assured dwelling, not
knowing where the Angel would command him to return ^ If Saint Paul
admired so much the obedienc^ of Abraham when God commanded him to go out of
his country, for so much as God di^ not tell him into what coast he should
go, neither did Abraham ask it of him, Lord you command me to go; but tell
me then if it shall be by the south gate, or on the North side; but he pu^ him
self on the way, and went according as the spirit of God guided him. How
exceeding admirable then is this perfect obedience of Saint Joseph? The Angel
did not tell him until what time he should remain in Egypt, neither did he
inquire it, he remained there the space of five years, as the most part
believe, without seeking to inform himself of his return, assureing
himself that he who had commanded that he should go thither, would
command him again when he should return, wherein he was always ready
to obey; he was in a country not only of strangers but also enimyes of the
Israelites; for so much as the Egyptians had yet in mind, how they had left
them, what they had bereaved them of, and that they had been cause that a great
number of the Egiptians had been overwhelmed when they did pursue them, and
this stuck in their stomachs. I leave it to your consideration what desire
Saint Joseph might have of his return, because of the continual fears that
he might have amongst the Egip^ians: the grief of not knovving when he
should come forth might without doubt great^y afflict and torment his poor
heart; notvvith^^anding he remaynes always himself, always sweet,
tranquil, and perseuerant in his ^ubmission to the good pleasure of God, to
which he left himself fully to be guided; for ^s he was just, he had his
will allwaies squared, ^oyned and conform to the will of God. To ^ee just is
no other thing, then to be perfect^ie united to the will of God, and to be
always ^herein conform in all sorts of events, prosperous ^or adverse. That
Saint Joseph allwaies in all oc^^sions has been perfectly submisse unto the
divine will, none can doubt; do you not see how the Angel tourneth him at
all essaies, he tells ^im, that he must go into Egypt, he goes ^hither;
he commands that he return, and he retourneth: God would that he
should be always poor, which is one of the most forceable proofs that
we can have, and he submits himself loueinglie thereunto, and not for a
time, for this was all his life: but with what poverty? with a
contemptible, needye, and reiectable poverty. The voluntary poverty
vvhere-of Religious make profession, is very amiable, for so much as it
hinders them not, from taking and receiving those things which shall be
necessary for them, only forbidding and depriving them of superfluities: But
the poverty of Saint Joseph, of our Lord, and our Blessed Lady was not
such: for allthough it was voluntary, for so much as he did love it
dearly, it did not leave therefore to be abject, rejected and contemned, and
in very great necessity: for every one esteemed this great Saint as a poor
carpenter, who without doubt could n^ make such gain, but that many necessary
thin^ would be wanting, although he did take payn^ with an exceeding
affection, for the entertaynm^^^ of his whole family, which done he did
subm^^ himself most humbly to the will of God, in t^ continuatio^ of his
poverty and abiection, not pe^mitting himself to be overthrown, nor
vanquished by interior disquietness, which vvitho^^ doubt did make him many
assaults; but remayn^ allwaies constant in submission, the which (as his other
virtues) went continually increasing a^ perfectionating themselves, even as
that of our B^ Lady, who did gain every day an ouer-grow of virtues and
perfections, that she did learn her most holy son, who could not increase
any thing, for so much as he was from the insta^^ of his conception such as
he is, and shall be eternalie, which did cause that the holy family wher-hee
was, went allwaies increasing and aduanci^^ in perfection: Our Bl. Lady
drawing her perf^ction from his divine goodness, and Saint Iosep^ receiving it
(as we have allreadie said) by the m^diation of our Bl. Lady.

. 5. Now what remains there more to b^ saved, but that we ought not to
doubt, but that the Glorious Saint has much creditt with him ^ heaven, who
has favored him so much as to assu^^ him thither in body and soul, the
which is ^ much the more probable, because we have not ha^ any Relic of his
here below on earth, and seems to me that none can doubt of this veriti^^
for how could he refuse this grace to Saint I^seph who had been so obedient
to him all the day ^ of his life? without doubt when our Lord descended into
Limbus Patrum, he was spoken unto b^ Saint Joseph in this sort; My Lord,
remember yo^ self if you please, that when you came from heaven ^o earth, I
received you in-to my family, and that when you were borne I received you into
my arms; now that you must go to heaven lead me^ ^hither with you, I received
you into my family, receive me now into yours, since you go thither: I have
carried you between my arms, now take me upon yours, and as I have had care
to nourish and conduct you, during the course of your mor^all life; take care
of me and conduct me to the immortal life: and if it is true, the which we
ought to believe, that in virtue of the most Bl. Sa^rament that we receive,
our bodies shall rise again at the day of judgment, how can we doubt, that
our Lord did cause the Glorious Saint Joseph ^o ascend with him into heaven
asvvell body as soul, who had had the honor, and the grace to ^arrie him so
often in his Bl. arms, the which did ^lease our Lord so much: O how many
kisses did ^ee tenderly give him from his Blessed mouth, for ^o recompense in
some sort his labor. Saint Io^eph then is in heaven in body and soul
without doubt. How happy should vee be if we could deserve to have part in
his holy intercessions; for nothing shall be denied him neither of our Bl. Lady
^or her Glorious son, he will obtain for us if we have confidence in him,
a holy growth in all sorts of virtues, but espetiallie in those which we
have found, that he had, in a more high degree ^hen all others, which are the
most holy purity of body and spirit, and the most amiable virtue of
humility, constancye, valor, and perseverance: virtues which make us in this
life become victo^ious over our enimyes, and which will make us deserve the
grace to enjoy eternal rewards in the next life, which are prepared for
them who shall ^imitate the example that Saint Joseph has given them being
in this mortal life, a reward which shall be no less the^ eternal
felicity; in the which we shall enjoy the clear vision of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost. God be Blessed Amen.

LIVE JESUS.
THE TVVENTITH ENTERTAINMENT.
IN WHICH IS DEMAVNDED what pretention we ought to have entering into
Religion.
. 1. THe question that our Mother proposet^ unto me to declare unto you, my
dea^ daughters; to wit the pretense which one ought t^ have to enter into
Religion, is truly the most important, most necessary, and profitable that
can b^ explicated. Verily, my dear daughters, many women enter into Religion,
who know not wherefore: they will come to a parloyr or speaking plac^ where
they shall see the Religious women wit^ a cheerful countenance, haueing a
good gestur^ very modest, and much contented, and they vvi^^ say within
themselves, good God! It is good ^^ be there, Let us go thither, the world
do^ frown upon us, we meet not with our pretentions in it. Another will say:
good God! how we^ they sing! others come thither to encounter peac^
consolations, and all sorts of sweetnesses, sayin^ in their thought; My God!
how happy are Rel^gious women! being out of the noise of father and mother,
who do no other thing then complain and chide, vee can do nothing which
contenteth them, we are allwaies to begin anew: Our Lord promises those who
forsake the world for his service many consolations; let us go then into
Religion. Behold, my dear daughters, three sorts of pretentions which are
worth nothing to make us enter into the house of God. Of necessity it must be
God who builds the City, or otherwise although it were built, it must be
ruined again. I will believe, my dear daughters, that your pretentions are
better grounded, and therefore that you have all good courages; and that God
will bless this little company nevvbegun.

. 2. There commetth to my mind two or three similitudes fit to give you to
understand vvhervppon, and how your pretentions ought to be founded for to
be solid: but I vvvill content my self to explicate one which shall
suffice: put the case that an architect would build a house, he does two
things: first he considers if his building be for some particular, as for a
Prince, or a king: because he must proceed there-in in different manner; then
he must reckon hy himself if his means be sufficient for it: For he who
would undertake to build a high tovver, and had not vvherevvith to finish it,
would he not be laughed at, for haueing begun a thing in which he could not
come of with his honor? then he must resolve himself to ruin the old
building, which is in the place where he would erect a new. We would make
a great building; my dear daughters, which is to build a habitation for God
within us: therefore let us consider well and maturelie if we have sufficient
courage and resolution to ruin and crucify our selves, or rather to permit
God to mortify and crucify us, to the end that he reedifie us, for to be
the liueing temple of his Majesty: Therefore I say, my most dear daughters,
that our only pretention ought to be to unite us to God, as Jesus Christ did
unite himself to God his Father, which was in dying upon the Cross: for I
intend not to speak to you, of that general union which is made by Baptism,
where Christians unite themselves to God in taking this divine Sacrament and
caracter of Christianisme, and oblige themselves to keep his commandments,
and those of his Holy Church, to exercise themselves in good works, to
practice the virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, which union of theirs is
auailable and may justly pretend heaven, For uniting themselves by this means
to God, as to their God, they are not obliged any further, they have attained
their end, by the general and spacious way of the commandments. But
touching you my dear daughters, it is not so; for besides this common
obligation that you have with all Christians, God by a very spetiall love has
chosen you to be his dear spouses You ought then to know how and what it is
to be Religious women. It is; to be bound to God by a continual
mortification of our selves, and not to live but for God, our heart always
serving his divine Majesty: our eyes, our tongue, our hands, and all the rest
serueing him continually. Wherefore you see that Religion furnishes you
with all means proper for this effect, which are, prayer, reading, silence,
vvithdravving of your heart from creatures to rest it in God only by
continual darting of affections to our Lord. And because we cannot arrive to
this, but by the continual practice of mortification of all our passions,
inclinations, humors, and auersions, we are obliged to vvatch continualle
over our selves, that we may make all this to die. Know (my dear sisters)
that if a grain of wheat falling into the ground do not dye, it remains
alone: but if it corrupt, it will bring forth a hundred fould: the word of
our Lord herein is very clear, his most blessed mouth haueing pronounced the
same: consequently, you who pretend the habitt, and you also who pretend the
holy Profession, consider well more then once, if you have sufficient
resolution to die to your selves, and not to live but to God. Consider all
well, the time is long enough to ruminate there-on before your vailes be dyed
black: for I declare to you, my dear daughters, and I will not flatter you;
whosoever desire to live according to nature, let them remain in the world:
and those who are determined to live according to grace, let them come into
Religion, which is no other thing then the school of abnegation and
mortification of ones self; wherefore look to it, that you be furnished
with many instruments of mortification asvvell interior as exterior. But good
God! you will say to me, This is not that, that I sought after; I thought it
was sufficient for to be a good Religious woman, to desire to pray well,
to have visions and revelations, yea of Angels in form of men, to be
ravished in ecstasy, to love well the reading of good books; and what else.
I was so virtuous, as it seemed to me, so mortified, so humble, all the
world did admire me; was it not to be humble, to speak so svveetlye of all
things appertayning to devotion to my companions, to recount the sermons by my
self, to converse gentlye with those of the house, above all when they did
not contradict me? certainly, my dear daughters, this was good for the
world: But Religion wills that we do works worthy of her vocation:
that we dye to all things, asvvell to that which is good to our will, as to
vnprofitall and evil things. Think you that the good Religious men of the
desert, who attained to so great union with God, arrived thereunto in
follovving their inclinations? Truly no, they were mortified in most holy
exercises, and although they felt great gust to sing the divine Canticles, to
read, pray, and do other things, they did it not to content themselves; no not
so, but contrariwise, they did voluntarily deprive themselves of these
pleasures, for to give themselves to paynfull and labor some works. It is
very true certaynlie that Religious souls receive a thousand suauities and
contentments amidst the mortifications and exercises of holy Religion: for it
is principally to them that the holy ghost distributeth his precious gifts:
therefore they ought to seek nothing but God, and the mortification of their
humors, passions, and inclinationes in holy Religion; for if they seek any
other thing, they shall never find the consolation that they pretended* we
must have an invincible courage not to be weary with our selves, because
that we shall always have somvvhat to do, and to cut off.

. 3. The office of Religious ought to be to cultiuate their spirit, to root
out all the ill productions that our depraved nature every day causes to bud,
so that it seems there is always something to be done anew, and as the
labourer ought not to be troubled, since he is not to be blamed for not
having reaped a good cropp, provided notvvithstanding that he has care to
cultiuate the earth well, and to sovve it well: even so Religious ought not
to be afflicted, if they gather not so soon the fruits of perfection and
virtues, provided that they have great fidelity to cultiuate the earth of
their heart well, cutting of that which they perceive to be contrary to
perfection, to the which they are obliged to aim, since we shall never be
perfectly cured until we be in heaven. When your Rule tells you, that
you ask for books at the appointed hour, think you that those which content
you most, shall ordinarily be given you? noe, this is not the intention of
the Rule, and the like of other exercises. A sister will think, as it seems
to her, that she is very much invited to prayer, to say her Office, to be
retired, and the Superiors say to her; sister go to the kitshen, or else, do
such or such a thing, this is ill nevves for a sisters that is very devout. I
say then that we must die that God may live in us, for it is impossible to
procure the union of our soul with God, by any other means then by
mortification. These words are hard, we must dye: but they are seconded
with great sweetness, that is, to the end we may be united to God by this
death. You know that no wise man puts new wine into an old vessel; the
liquour of divine Love cannot enter, where the old Adam reigns: he must of
necessity be destroyed: but how, you will say to me, will he be
destroyed? how? my dear daughters, by punctual obedience to your Rules: I
assure you on the part of God, that if you be faithful to do that they teach
you, you shall attain without doubt to the end you ought to pretend, which
is to unite your selves with God. Mark that I say; to do: for we cannot
purchase perfection by crossing our arms, we must labor in good sadness even
from the heart, to tame and reclame our selves, and to live according to reason,
our Rule, and obedience, and not according to the inclinations we have
brought from the world. Religion tolerateth us to bring our evil habits,
passions, and inclinations, but not to live according to them, it gives us
Rules to serve us, to press and strain out of our hearts, whatsoever is
contrary to God: therefore live courageouslye according to them.

. 4. But some one will say. Good God! how shall I do, I have not the spirit
of Religion? Truly, my dear Daughter, I easily believe you, it is a thing
the world brings not to Religion. The spirit of the Rule is gained in
practiceing the Rule faithfully. I say the same of holy humility, and
mildness, the foundation of this congregation, God will infalliby give it us,
provided that we have a good heart, and do our endeavor to get it; we
shall be very happy if one quarter of an hour before we dye, we find our
selves reuested with this garment, all our life vvil be well impoyed, if we
labor to work thereon, sometimes one piece, sometimes another; for this holy
habitt is not made with one only piece, it is requisite there be many. You
think peradventure, that perfection is to be found already made, and that
there is no other thing necessary to be done, but to put it over your head as
a garment: No no; my Dear Daughters it is not so. Mother, you tell me, our
sisters the Nouices are of good will: but that abillitie is vvanting to put
their desires in execution, and that they feel their passions so strong, that
they almost fearre to begin to go on; Courage, my Dear Daughters, I have
told you many times that Religion is a school where we learn our lesson:
the Master requires not always, that without fail the Scholars know
their lesson, i^ suffices that they have attention to do their endeavor to
learn it: Let us also do what we can, God vvil be contented, and our
superiors also.

Do you not see every day those who learn to bear arms fall often? in
like manner do those who learn to ride a horse well, but they are not
therefore held for vanquished: for it is one thing to be cast so^times to the
ground, and another to be absolutely overcome.

Your passions at times make head against you, and therefore you say, I am not
fit for Religion, because I have passion: No, my Dear Daughters, you are
deceived, the matter goes not so: Religion accounts no great triumph to
frame a spirit allreadye made, a svveete soul and peaceful in its self: but
she exceedingly esteems to reduce to a virtuous course souls that are
strong in their inclinations; for these souls if they are faithful vvil
surpass the others, getting by the point of the spirit, which others have
without pain. We do not require of you, that you should not have passions
(it is not in your power, and God will that you feel them until death, for
your greater meritt) nor likvvise that they be but of little strength, for
this should be as much as to say, that a soul ill habituated could not be
fit to serve God: the world is deceived in this thought, God rejects
nothing, where malice does not intrude it self; For tell me, I pray you, if
a person be of such or such a temper, subject to such or such a passion, how
can he help it? therefore all consists in the acts that we make by the
motions which depend of our will: sin being so voluntary that without our
consent there is no sin. Put the case that I be overtaken with choler; I
would say to it; Turn and return, riue in sunder if thou vvilt, I will do
nothing for thy respect, no not so much as to pronounce a word, according to
thy suggestion: God has left this in our power, otherwise in requireing
perfection of us, it should be to oblige us to a thing impossible and
consequently injustice, which cannot be in God.

. 5. To this purpose there comes into my mind, a history which is proper
for our purpose: when Moses descended from the mountain where he did
speak with God, he savv the people, who having made a golden calfe did
adore it: touched with just choler for zeal of the Glory of God, he said:
(turning himself toward the Levites;) If there be any one for our Lord, let
him take his svvord in hand, to kill all those that shall present themselves
before him, not sparing any, neither father nor mother, sister nor brother, but
put all to death: The Levites the^ taking the svvord in hand, he was the
most famous who killed most: In like manner, my dear daughters, take the
svvord of mortification into your hand; for to kill and annihilate your
passions, and she who shall have the most to kill shall be the most valiant, if
she will cooperate with grace. Behold these two young souls (whereof the
one is a little past six years old, the other about five) they have fevv to
kill, also their spirit is not almost borne: but these great souls who have
experienced many things, and have tasted the svveetnesses of heaven, it is to
them to whom it appertains to kill and annihilate their passions well.
Dear mother, for those, who, you say, have so great desire of their
perfection, that they would pass all others in virtue, they do well to
comfort their self-love a little, but they should do well to follovv the
community in keeping their rules well: for that is the right way to arrive
to God. You are very happy, my dear daughters, in respect of us in the
world; when we ask the way, one says it is on the right hand, another on
the left, and for the most part they deceive us: but you, you have nothing to
do, but to permit your selves to be carried: you are like to those that
sail upon the sea, the barque carries them, and they remain within it
without care, and in reposeing they go forwards, and have nothing to do to
enquire if they are in their way, which is the duty of the mariners, who
always see the fair star, the guide of the shipp knows that they are in
a good way, and says to the others, who are in the barque, courage you are
in a good way, follovv on without fear. This divine Pilote is our Lord, the
barque is your Rules, those who guide it are the Superious, who ordinarily
call upon you, go forvvard sisters by the punctual observance of your Rules,
you shall happily arrive to Almigtye God, he will guide you surely.

. 6. But mark what I tell you, walk by the punctual and faithful
obserua^ce of them; for who contemns his way shall be killed, says Solomon.
Mother, you say that our sisters say it is good to walk by the rules, but it
is the general way, God draws us by particular attracts, every one to her
spetiall, we are not all drawn by one and the same way; they have reason
to say so, and it is true: but it is a so true, that if this tract come from
God, it will lead the^ to obedience without doubt: it appertains not unto
us who are inferiors to judge of our particular attracts, this is the duty
of superiors, and therefore particular direction is ordained; be you very
faithful therein, and you shall reap the fruit of benediction, my dear
daughters, if you do this which is taught you, you shall be very happy, you
shall live content and you shall experience in this world the favors of
heaven at least in some small quantity. But take heed that if some interior
gust come to you and cherishings from our Lord, not to tie your self unto
them; it is a fevv Annisco^fitts that the Apothecarie strevveth upon a bitter
potion for a sick person: the sick must swallow the bitter medicine for his
health: and allthough he take from the hand of the Apothecarie these sugared
grains, yet must he of necessity feel afterward the bitterness of the
purgation. Therefore you see clearly what the pretention is that you ought to
have, to be worthy spouses of our Lord, and to make your selves capable to
be vvedded to him upon the mount of Caluarie. Therefore all your life live and
frame all your actions according to it, and God will bless you; All our
happiness consists in perseverance. I exhort you thereunto (my Dear
Daughters) with all my heart, and pray his divine goodness, that he will fill
you with grace, and with his divine love in this world, and make us all
enjoy his Glory in the other life. Farevvell, my Dear Daughters, I bear you
all in my heart: to commend my self to your prayers would be superfluous, for
I believe of your piety you will not be vvanting. I will send you every
day from the Altar my benediction; and in the mean time receive it: In the
name of the father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

LIVE JESUS.
THE ONE AND TWENTY ENTERTAINMENT.
TOUCHING, THE DOCVMENT OF demanding nothing, nor refusing any thing.
. 1. MOther, I spoke one day with an excellent Religious woman who did ask
of me, if having a desire to communicate oftener then the community, one might
desire it of the Superior; I said to her, that if I were a Reliligious man I
think I should do thus: I would not ask to communicate more often the^ the
co^munitie did, I would not ask to wear haircloth, to make extraordinary
fasts, to take disciplines, nor do any other thing; I would content my self
to follovv in all and through all the community; if I wear strong, I would
not eat four times a day, but if my Superior made me eat four times a day,
I would do it and say nothing; if I were vveake, and he did not offer me
to eat but once a day, I would eat but once a day without thinking whether
I should be vveake or not. I desire fevv things, and that which I desire, I
desire it very little, I have almost no desires; but if I were to be newborn, I would have none at all, if God came to me, I would also go to him:
and if he would not come to me, I would keep me there and not go to him:
I say then, we must nether ask nor refuse any thing, but leave our selves
wholye in the hands of the divine providence, without museing upon any desire,
but to vvil that which God would have of us. Saint Paul did excelcellently
practice this abnegation, in the very instant of his conversion, when our Lord
had made him blind, presently he said: Lord, what will thou have me to do?
and from thenceforth, he did allwaies remain in an absolute dependence of
that which God should ordain for, and of him; all our perfection consists in
the practice of this point: and the same Saint Paul writeing to one of his
disciples forbids him among other things to permit his heart to be
preoccupated by any desire so great knowledge had he of this defect.

. 2. You say, if we must not desire virtues, wherefore has our Lord said,
ask and it shall be given you. O my daughter? when I say that we must not ask
nor desire any thing, I intend terestriall things: as for virtues we may ask
them, and demanding the love of God, we comprehe^d them all therein; for it
contains them all. But for the exterior employment, should we not (say you)
desire base offices, because they are more paynfull, and there is more to be
done, and to humble ones self the more for God. My daughter, David says
that he did love better to be abject in the house of our Lord, then to be
great among sinners: And it is good, Lord, (says he) that thou have humbled
me, to the end I may learn thy iustifications: notvvithstandinh this desire
is very suspicious, and perhapps a humayne cogitation: what know you haueing
desired abject offices, whether you shall have the courage to accept the
abiections which you shall meet withal in them? it may be there will happen
many disguste, and bitternesses; although that now you feel the courage to
suffer mortification, and humiliation what know you, if you shall always
have it? In breife we must hold the desire of offices, whatsoever they be,
base or honorable, for a tentation, it is allwaies better to desire nothing,
but to prepare our selves to receive those, obedience shall impose upon us, and
be they honorable or abject, I would take and receive them humbly, without
speaking one only word, unless my superior did question me, and then I
would simply aunsweere the truth, as I should think it.

. 3. You ask me how we may practice this document of holy indifferency, in
sickness, I find in the holy Gospel a perfect modele in Saint Peter's wives
mother: this good woman lyeing sick in her bed in a great fever did practice
many virtues: but that which I most admire is the great neglect she had of her
self, relying on the divine providence, and the care of her Superiors,
remaining in her fever tra^quille and without any unquietness, nor giueing any
to those who were about her: notvvithstanding every one knovveth how much
those who are in fevers are molested, which hinders them from repose, and
gives them a thousand other vexations. Now this great resignation that our
sick made of her self into the hands of her superiors, caused her that she
was not vnquiett, nor did she take care for her health or her cure, she was
content to suffer her sickness with mildness and patience: O God! how happy
was this good woman! Truly she did deserve that they should take care of
her, as also the Apostles did, who provided for her cure, not being solicited
by her; but by charity and commiseration of what she suffered. Happy shall
those Religious persons be who shall make this great and absolute referring of
themselves into the hands of their superiors: who by the motion of Charity
shall serve them, and shall carefully provide for all their wants and
necessities: for Charity is more strong and presses more near then nature.
This good si^ke woman did know that our Lord was in Capharnaum, that he
cured the sick: and yet she was not unquiet, nor troubled not her self to
send to tell him what she suffered; but that which is more admirable, is
this: That she seeing him in the house, where he beheld her, and she also
beheld him, yet she did not speak one word to him of her infirmity, to
excite him to have pity upon her, nor press him to touch her for to be
healed. Now this unquietness of mind that we have in sufferance, and
sicknesses (to the which are subject not only worldly persons, but also
very often the Religious) springs from the disorderly love of our selves.

Our sick sister makes not any account of her sickness, she is not forvvard to
recount it, she suffers it without careing whether they bemoane her, or
procure her health, or no; she is content that our Lord knovveth it, and her
superiors who govern her, she sees our Lord in the house as a sovereign
Physician; but regards him not as such (so little thinks she of her
recovery) she rather considers him as her God, to whom she appertains
asvvell sick as in health: being as much content to be sick as to possess
perfect health.

O how many would have used sleights to be cured by our Lord, and would
have said, that they asked health the better to serve him, fearing something
should be vvanting to him.

But this good woman thought of nothing less then this, making her
resignation to appear in that she did not require her health: notvvithstanding
I vville not say, but that we may ask it of our Lord as of him who can give
it, with this condition if such be his will: for we ought alvvaies to say
Fiat voluntas tua: it is not sufficient to be sick and to have afflictions,
beccause God would have it so; but it must be as he will, and as long a
time as he will, and in the manner it pleases him that it should be, not
making any choice of any sickness or affliction whatsoever, how abject or
dishonorable it may seem to be: for sickness and affliction without abiection
very often svvelleth the heart in stead of humbling it: but when we have
sickness without honor, or with dishonor it self, disestimation and
abiection are our malady; how many occasions are there then to exercise
patience, humility, modesty and sweetness of mind and heart.

Let us therefore have a great care, as this good vvoma^ had, to keep our
heart in mildness, making profitt as she did of our sicknesses: for she did
rise so soon as our Lord had chaced away the fever, and served him at the
table, wherein certaynlie she demonstrated great virtue, and the profitt she
had made of her sickness, of the which being quitted, she would not use her
health but for the service of our Lord; employing herself therein in the same
instant that she had received it.

Besides; she was not like persons of the world, who having a sickness of
some days, must have weeks and months to restore themselves.

Our Lord upon the Cross, makes us to see very well, how we ought to
mortify these delicacies: for haueing extreme thirst, he did not ask to
drink; but simply manifested his necessity, saving, I am thirsty: after
which he perfomed an act of very great submission, for some one having
offered him on the point of a lance, a piece of spou^ge moistened in vinegar to
quench his thirst, he sucked it with his blessed lips: a strange thing ^he
was not ignorant that this was a draught which should augment his pain:
neuertheless he took it simply, not making show that it did trouble him that
he had not found it good, to teach us with what submission we ought to
take the remedies and meats presented us when we are sick, not so much as
making shevve that we are disgusted and grieved, yea also when we shall be
in doubt that this will increase our disease. Alas! haueing never so little
incommodity we do quite contrary to that which our svveete Master: has
taught us: for we cease not to lament, and find not persons sufficient, as
it seems, to bemoane our case; and to recount our greefes by parcells unto
us, our pain whatsoever it be is incomparable, and those that others suffer
are nothing in respect; we are more melancholy and impatient then can he
declared, we find nothing that goes as it ought, to content us. In fine it
is great pity to see how little we are the true imitatours of our Savior,
who did forgett his greefes, and endeavored not to have them marked by men,
contenting himself that his eternal father by whose obedience he suffered
did consider them, and would cease his anger toward humayne nature, for the
which he did suffer.

. 4. You ask what I desire should remain most engraven in your mind, the
better to put it in practice: Ah! what shall I say to you, my most dear
daughters, but these two dear words, that I have allreadie so much
recommended unto you? desire nothing, refuse nothing; in these two words I
say all: for this document comprehends the perfect practice of indifferency.
Behold the poor little Jesus in the crib, he received poverty, nakedness,
the company of beasts, all the injuries of the time, cold, and all that his
father permitted to arrive unto him: it is not written that he ever put forth
his hands to have the breast of his mother, he left himself wholly to her
care and providence nether did he refuse those little comforts that she
offered him, he received the services of Saint Joseph, the Adoration of the
three Kings, and of the shepherds, with equal indifferency: even so we
ought neither to desire nor refuse any thing, but to suffer and receive
equally all that the providence of God shall permit to happen unto us: God
give us his grace so to do. Amen.

GOD BE BLESSED. Out of the same Author.
AN exercise for the morneing, which being breife, simple, and tending
immediately to the loueing union of our will with the will of God, may be
practiced by persons who are in dryness, sterilitie, and corporal weakness, or
overwhelmed with businesses.

The first point: prostrate on your knees, and profoundly humbled before the
incomprehensible Majesty of God, do you adore his soueraygne goodness, who
from all eternity has named you by your name, and determined to save you,
ordayning among other things this present day, to the end that there-in you
should come to exercise the works of life and salvation, according to that
which is said by the Prophet. I have loved thee with perpetual charity,
therefore I have drawn the haueing pity of thee.

The second Point: upon this veritable thought, you shall unite your will to
that of the most benign and most merciful celestial father, by these or the
like words cordially offerred. O most svveete will of my God, be thou ever
fulfilled in me. O eternal designs of the will of my God, I adore you,
consecrat and dedicate my will, for to will eternally that which thou have
willed! O that I could do therefore this day, and always, and in all things
thy divine will! O my sweet creator! yea celestial father, for such was thy
good pleasure from all eternity, So be it. O most delectable goodness, be it
as thou have willed! O eternal will, live and reign in all my wills, and over
all my wills now and for ever Amen. The third Point. After invoke the divine
help and assistance with these or the like devour acclamations, interiourlie
notwithstanding, and from the depth of the heart. O God inte^d unto my help!
Let thy helping hand be upon this poor and weak heart of mine. Behold O
Lord this poor and miserable heart which through thy goodness has conceived
many holy affections: but Alas! it is to feeble and vvretched to effectuate
the good it desires without thy help. I invoke the most sacred virgin
Marie, my good Angel and all the court of heaven, that their favor may now
be propitious unto me, if thou please. The fourth Point. Make then a
lively and powerful Loving union of your will with Gods holy will, and
then among all the actions of that day asvvell spiritual as corporal, make
frequent revnions thereof; that is to say, renew and confirm again the
vnio^ made in the morning, casting a simple interior look upon the divine
goodness and saying by way of yealding (or) agreement. Yeas, Lord, I will,
yeas my father: yeas always; yea. Also if you will you may make the sign
of the Cross: or kiss that which you bear about you, or some Image; for all
this signifies that soueraynelie you desire the providence of God, that you
accept it, that you adore it, and love it with all your heart, and that
inseparably you unite your will to that supreme will, notvvista^ding all
trouble and repugnance. The fifth point. But these tracts of the heart, these
interior words ought to be pronounced svveetely, quietly, and constantly:
but peaceably, and by way of speech, they ought to be distilled, and spun as
it were gently from the top of the spirit, as we pronunce a word in the
ear of a friend, that we would cast deep into his heart, that noe body may
hear or pereeaue it; for so these sacred words drawn sliding, and
distilling from the intimate depth of our soul will penetrate and moisten it
more intimately and strongly then they would do if they were said by way
of iaculatorie prayers and fa^lies of the spirit, experience will make you
know this, provided you be humble and simple* so be it.
