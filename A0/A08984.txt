A true Subjects wish.
For the happy success of our Royal Army preparing to resist the factious
Rebellion of those insolent Covenanters (against the sacred Majesty, of our
gracious and loving king Charles) in Scotland.
To the tune of, O how now Mars, etc.


(...) ever England had occasion,
Her ancient honor to defend,
(...) let her now make preparation,
(...) honorable end:
the ^actious Scot
is very hot,
(...)ent spleen is neer' forget
(...) has bin about this plot.
(...) the color of religion,
(...)ith hypocritical pretense)
(...)e a fraction in that Region,
(...) against their native Prince,
(...) heaven bless
with (...)nesse,
(...) all his enemies repress,
^^^st be he that wishes less.
(...) gracious Sovereign very mildely,
(...) them what they did desire,
(...) ingratefully and vildly,
(...) still continued the fire
(...)discontent
against government,
(...) England now is fully bent,
proud Iocky's bosting to prevent.
(...) imports Englands honor
(...) bless Rebels to oppose,
(...) Saint Georges banner,
(...) them as our countries foes,
and they shall see,
how stoutly we,
(for Royal Charles with courage free)
will fight if there occasion be.
Unto the world it is apparent,
That they rebel in the highest degree,
No true Religion will give warrant,
That any subject armed should be,
against his Prince
in any sense,
what ere he hold for his pretense,
Rebellion is a souls offense.
Nay more to aggrauate the evil,
And make them odious among good men,
It will appear, that all their level,
Is change of government, and then,
what will ensue,
amongst the crew,
but Iocky with his bonnet blew,
both Crown and Scepter would subdue.
Why of these men will take compassion,
That are disloyal to their king,
Among them borne in their own nation,
And one who in each lawful thing,
does seek their weal,
with perfect Zeal,
to any good man I Will appeal,
if with king Charles they rightly deal.
The Second part,
To the same tune.


THe Lord to publish their intentions,
Did bring to light a treacherous thing,
For they to further their inventions,
A Letter wrote to the French King,
and in the same,
his aid to claim,
with subtlety their words they frame,
which letter to our Sovereign came.
Then let all loyal subjects judge it,
If we have not a cause to fight,
You who have money do not grudge it,
But in your king and countries right,
freely disburse.
both person purse,
and all you may to avoid the curse,
of lasting war which will be worse.
If they are grown so far audacious,
That they durst call in foreign aid,
Against a king so mild and gracious,
Have we not cause to be afraid,
of life and blood,
we then had stood,
in danger of such neighborhood,
in time to quell them twill be good.
Then noble Countrymen be armed,
To tame these proud outdaring Scots,
That Englands honor be not harmed,
Let all according to their lots,
courageously
their fortune try,
against the vaunting enemy,
and come home crowned with victory.
The noble Irish good example,
Does give of his fidelity,
His purse, and person is so ample.
To serve his royal majesty,
and gladly he
the man will be,
to scourge the Scots disloyalty,
if Englands honor would agree.
Then we more merely interessed,
Ith ^^nture danger that might chance,
If that against our sovereign blessed,
Those rebels had got aid from France,
should not be slack,
nor ere shrink back,
or let king Charles assistance lack,
to tame in time this saucy Jack.
We have a General so noble,
(The great Earl of Northumberland)
That twill (I trust) be little trouble,
Those factious rebels to withstand*
his very name
seems to proclaim,
and to the world divulge the same,
his ancestors there won such fame.
The God of host's go with our army
My noble hearts for you i will pray,
That never any foe may harm ye*
Nor any stratagem betray
your brave design,
may beams divine,
upon your ensigns brightly shine,
Amen say I, and every friend of mine
FINIS.
