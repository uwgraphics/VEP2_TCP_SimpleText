Factum, or Rehearsal of the whole Cause, with Proofs and Reasons to
maintain and defend it.
FOr William Noel, Substitute of William Willaston, Robert Houe, Citizens of
the Town of Morlais, Matthew Harvey, Richard Beauais, James Goult, Edward
Blancare, Thomas Helcott, and other partners, English Merchants, both
Plaintiffes, and Defendants. Against Andrew de Launay, both Defendant and
Plaintiff, and Marteau substitute to the right and room of Helias Fruit,
lately deceased, joining and interposing himself to this (...); The said Noel
and Houe being Denizons and naturalised in France; and the rest of their
partners being Englishmen, who have daily traded there fifteen years in the
Town of Morlais: the said Noel and Houe, are housekeepers, and the rest held
as Inhabitants of the Kingdom, did in October 1620. Fraught and furnish a
Bark, called the George, laden with whole packs of linen cloth, to be
transported into England, the said Launay of Roscoff, with his accomplices, to
the number of twelve Robbers, by him armed, did follow her with a Pinnace the
nineteenth of the said month, and by force and violence, took, robbed, and
ransackt her at the going out of the Ryver or Haven of Morlais, and stripped
naked, the Master, and four Mariners, which were in the same, without any
weapons, and set them forsaken, in a desert Island, barren and dry of any sweet
water, but only with a loaf of rye bread of six pence, with a wicked intent,
to starve them with thirst and hunger, as no doubt it had happenned, had not
God in his providence sent by chance a Fisher-boat that way the fourth day,
that took them up, and set them to land almost ready to perish. And as for
the said Wares, the said Pirates did unlade many packes of them by night, at
the said Roscoff, and i will of Bas, whereof the said Launay, his wife, and
children, did dispose at their pleasure, transporting and hiding them in diverse
places, and there caused the said Bark to be sent and set a-ground, at Angels
Haven, where it was again pillaged, and finally forsaken, whereof the Kings
Attorney taking notice, caused an Inventory to be made of the said Bark, and
goods, and did examine the said Mariners, yea, some of the very Robbers, making
his report of it, and seazing upon the residue, to be kept and preserved to the
use of the right owners, by which report it is to be seen, that the English
did lay claim to the said Bark, and goods, thereupon making their complaint,
and requiring that they should be set free; and delivered into their hands,
whereupon the said Judge being fully informed of the said Robbery and
Depredation, and that those goods did belong to those English and French
Merchants, by his sentence the thirtieth of October, did fully discharge and
res^ore them into their hands, having first given good and sufficient Suerties
for the price and vallew of them, by expert and skillful men, and chosen by
virtue of his place, as Judge for his own discharge and security, and so in
consideration of the said Suerties, they received their Bark and goods, and
sent and sold them in England, upon which Informations, there went forth an
Order against Laun^y, and his Accomplices, and they were so appeached and
indicted, as that they were condemned by a sentence the thirteenth of June,
1621. Daniell Rowland, Mandoux les Marec, Father and Son, Couault and
Conefer, for to be hanged and strangled, and the said Launay with two other
men, Galls and Loges, banished for five years, and solitarily all together,
or one of all condemned to restore to the said English, nine packes and fardles
of the said Wares, which had been landed and set ashore to the same Town of
Roscoff, or else the just vallew of them, and over and above to all their costs
and expenses, and as for his other Accomplices, Querovarts, Pallu, and
Enhabasque, who had broken the Prison, and made an escape: it was ordered, that
they should be publicly summoned to appear within three short days. But to
make these pursutes and Judgments void, the said Launay fled to the
Council, where disguising the fact, and against all truth, informing them his
proceedings had been but by way of seizure and attachment against the English,
and by right of some Letters of Mart, for a Ship of his which he pretended to
have been taken from him some nine years since by some English Piratts, which
he himself terms to be such, in whose taking, he pretended to have lost some
1200. pound Sterling, and so making himself a Plaintiff, and requiring a
discharge of his pretended and imiginary Attachment, or extent of the same
goods. Whereupon the parties being called, and appearing before the Council,
the said Launay (to give a better color to his cause) did practice, and got
the said late Helias Fruit, a Dutch Merchant, to join and interpose himself
to him in this cause; the said Fruit having been once Master of a Dutch
Ship, whereof Sir John Fernes was Captain. And again, the said Fruit
calling, and intituling himself one of the Directors of a Company established
in France, for the Trading into the East Indies; which Fruit this Launay did
set of purpose, to require, that the rest of the said goods belonging to the
said English, might be sold for his satisfaction, and repayment of the sum of
9200. pound Sterling, which he pretended to have been taken from him four
years before by some other English Pirates, for which he said, he could get
no Justice in England.

Moreover, the said Laun^y and Marteau, substitute in the pretended right of
Helias Fruit deceased, being so joined together, did demand the second time,
the cassation and disannulling of the said criminal proceedings, and sentence
of the Judge of the said Lesnevers, to the end that Launay might have a
discharge or release for his own goods, which were seized and extended by
virtue of the said sentence and Judgment: whereupon the said Launay and
Marteau got so much favor, that although the English did proceed in the said
Council but declinatorely (that is to say, standing upon exception, and
refused to be tried by that Court) desiring that the cause and parties might
be sent back into Britain, before the natural and ordinary Judges, for
execution of their former Judgments, and in case of Apeale if need were
before the high Court of Parliament of the Province.

Nevertheless, without appointing that the parties should ever write or enter
into any proofs in the maine cause or principal: yea, without so much as
hearing them at all theretn, the Privy Council was pleased against all forms
of Justice, to pronounce and enact their Decree in the maine cause, the 27. of
January, 1622. which Decree contrarying and contradicting it self, does award
that the whole criminal proceedings, should be brought to the office of the
Council, to do right unto the parties, according to reason: and in the mean
time the former sentences of death and banishment to surcease, with full leave
and power to the said Launay, to reside and dwell in the Country as he might
have done before those Judgments, yea with a general discharge, and freedom
for all his goods seized by virtue of them, of which the Commissioners or
Depositaries shall make him just account, and give him the residue or surplus,
and without any regard to the said sentence of the thirtith of October, 1620.
whereby the English had a discharge and a release of their Bark and goods,
they did order that without any prejudice or hinderance to the maine cause and
principal, and rato prevent the decay and perishing of the wares, both the
wares and Bark should be sold at Saint Malloes, to the uttermost, and the
price thereof put into the hands of sufficient Merchants, on whom the parties
should agree before the Commissioner; who should transport himself in those
places, and that as well the English parties, as their sureties, and
Depositaries should be constrained to represent the said Bark and goods in
pain of imprisonment.

Against this so extraordinary Decree, both the said English and French parties
sought their redress by petition, as well because that Decree is all forms
and custom, because they did contest; but declinatorily, and by way of
exception: a difficulty which was first to be discussed, and yet it does
pronounce and decide at once upon the main and principal. Whereupon there was
yet no contestation: as also that it is wholly contrary to it self. First in
so much as it being ordered, that the whole criminal cause should be brought,
that right might be done unto the parties accordingly, if follows, that
there could no right be done to them till it had been brought and answered.
Secondly, is there any thing more contrary to it self, then to order that
without prejudice to the right of the parties, in the principal, and to
prevent the decay and perishing of the seized goods, and without any regard to
the sentence of the thirtith of October, by which the English had got a
discharge and release of their own goods and Bark, in giving good and
sufficient sureties. Now all those things shall be sold, and the moneys
issuing out of it, sequestered into the hands of sufficient men, and that as
well the English as their Sureties shall be forced to represent all those old
goods, even by restraint of their own persons, or can there be any more hurt
or prejudice done to the English, and French parties, then to force them mere
impossibilities, in representing that which was sold, and gone a whole year
before, by virtue of their discharge and release, or else to force them to
bring back again and consigne the value of their own goods, and that the
Commissioner shall transport himself so far, with great expense for the
execution of all this: was it not sufficient that the English had given
Sureties, and was not that equivolent to an evaluation and consignation of the
price of the said goods, and what greater decay and deperishing could happen
more then the costs and expenses, for the execution of the said Decree, and the
great losses and damages that the said English have suffered. For the
Commissioners being come to the place with Launay and Marteau, and at their
suite (who for their part confined not any thing for the journey) finding that
the said Bark and goods were no more to be found, in stead of contenting
themselves with their former Sureties, and of a new supply of others, offered
by the said English, whereof he should have made his report to the Council,
he caused out of hand many other Ships to be seized and stayed, laden with
store of marchandice, belonging as well to the said English Merchants, as to
diverse others of there nation, their Chambers to be locked and sealed,
hindering the transport of all marchandises, and causing all trade and commerce
to cease, during his abode of six weeks long in the town: yea more, caused
the said English and French Factors, and their Sureties to be arrested and
imprisoned, for not representing of the said Bark and goods, so that as well
to redeem themselves and their Sureties, from the imprisonment of their
bodies, and to procure their liberties again, as also to have a release and
discharge for those ships and goods newly seized upon, that were constrained
to suffer a new rate and valuation of their old Bark and goods, to be made to
the smmme of 1854. pound sterling, and to deposet the said sum (though most
impertinent) seeing the first estimation made of the goods alone, was 1714.
pound sterling, and that the interest of Launay in his pretended loss, by the
English Pirate was by himself claymed to be but 1200. pound sterling. Now upon
this sum of 1854. pound, the Commissioner took some 300. for fees and
taxations, as well for himself, his Clarke, and Register in the said
Commission, as for the Counselors, and Atturneys of the parties, and even for
those of Launay and Marteau: yea, for the very Sergeents which were employed
for the imprisoning of men, seazure and sale of the goods of one William
Baskrvile, lately deceased, being one of the English partners, which goods were
sold for the said consignation, by this means the Commissioner caused only
the English to bear the burden, notwithstanding all their former losses almost
inestimable, which amount to more then 5000. pound sterling, only in this last
seazure and retention of their ships, discontinuation and cessation of trade
and Commerce, which rigorous kind of proceeding did so seize the heart of poor
Baskervile, one of the most interressed in the business among the parties,
that he dyed for the mere grief of it, within two days, as is witnessed by
the very report of the Commissioner, who upon complaints of the rest of the
English, had sent back again all the parties to the Privy Council.
Whereupon, to witness the lawfulnes of their just plants, and the whole truth
of all the premises, the English have caused the said criminal cause and
sentence against Launay and his complicies, to be brought, together with the
report and relation of of the said Commissiouer, which does prove and justify
all that which is aforesaid, and shows that the fact of Launay and his
Accomplices, is but a mere robbery and pyracy, not any action of Mart or
reprisall, and that the said Decree of the Counsel, with the execution
thereof, has been such a great and notorious hurt and damage to the English,
as it cannot be colored nor maintained. Moreover, to prove that this robbery
cannot by any means be cloaked with any title of Mart, or reprisall. The
English do represent three things.

First, The Peace and Amity between the two Kings, during which, and the
liberty of Commerce and Trade; it is an absurd and contradictory thing, to
talk of Mart or reprisall.

Secondly, They produce the Articles of Peace, agreed upon between their
Majesty's, whereby it is most specially concluded, That all Letters of Mart and
Reprisall, which before then had been granted by any of the two Kings, shall
absolutely surcease, without being put to any execution, as well of one side as
of the other, and that for the time to come, there shall not any more be
granted, but that the Ambassadors shall respectively have warning of it
before hand, and those Letters be seen and well considered in the Council of
both Princes, sealed with their great seals, and generally, all the
solemnities in such case required be well observed.

Thirdly, Launay, and his accomplices cannot pretend any right of Reprisall,
since they are not bearers of, nor vpheld with any such Letters at all, granted
either with any of the former solemnities, nor in any other manner howsoever,
so that this fact cannot otherwise be called, but mere robbery, and pyracy,
for all these reasons, therefore the said English do conclude, and require by
their said Petition, that the said Decree of the Council of the
twentie-seaventh of January last, and all that thereupon is ensued, be
altogether revoked, casheired, and disanulled, and in stead thereof awarded,
that the said sum of 1854. pound Sterling, which they have been constrained
to deposet, as well for their liberties, and their Suerties, as for the release
of their Ships and goods seized, and from them detayned, shall be wholly
restored unto them, as well by the said Launay and Marteau, as by their
Serieants, Advocates, Attorneyes, Depositaries, and others, which have any
ways touched any part of it, every one according to their several rates and
portions, and so doing it may be ordered, that the Depositaries and Snerties
shall remain fully free, and altogether discharged, as also the said Launay,
and his accomplices, with Marteau and his partners, condemned in all the cost,
damage, and interest, of the said both English and French Merchants, and so all
with Launay, and his accomplices sent back again; before such Royal Judges in
those places, as his Majesty will be pleased to appoint, for the execution of
their said former sentence and Judgments, as well Criminal as Civil, of the
said Judge of Lesnevers, with reservation of Appeal, (if need be) to the high
Court of Parliament in Brittany.
