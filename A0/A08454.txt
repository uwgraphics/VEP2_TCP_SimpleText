Here begins ye hystory of Octauyan Emperor of Rome.
LYste^ lordy^ges both old and yinge
And hecke^ to my sweet talky^ge
Of whom I will you lythe
Ihesu that is our heaven king
Give us all his dear blessing
And make us glad and blythe
True tales I will you say
How it befell upon a day
And ye will lysten and lythe
In books of Rome as it is told
How it befell among our elders old
Often and fell sithe
Sometime there was an emperor
In rome of great honor
In romans as men can read
That man was of great honor
He lived in Joy and favor
As a doughty man of deed
In tournement and in fight
In the world was none so wight
As he was under wede
Octauyan the emperor hight
Of all the world he was the noblest knight
And a noble man of deed
An empress he had to his wife
One of the fairest that ever bare life
Thus say clerks us unto
Seven year they had together ben
With Joy and myrthe the^ between
As hit befell tho
The emperor upon a day
In his chumbre began sport and play
With his empress bright
He behelpe her fair chere
That was as white as blossom on brer^
And semely was on sight
A sorrow to his heart come
That he might have children none
Their lands to welde by right
By his lady he him set
For upon her his mind was knette
He was so kind a knight
When the lady began it se
She changed all her fayreble
And syghed wonder sore
She fell on knees her lord again
And of his sorrow began him frayne
And of his great care
Good lord if it were your will
Your counseyll that you would bring me till
And of your lives fare
Your counseyll to me that ye dyscouer
And for me hit shall never forther
I shall it keep whiles I may dure
And in his arms he began ger fold
And all his counseyll to her told
How his heart was ybounde
We have seven year together been
And have no children us between
We shall live both but a stou^de
I ne wot how my sone shall fare
But live in sorrow and in care
When I am to bed brought
I sleep full ill / vnsunde on night
Then answered that lady bright
Sir I can tell you I have bethought
A rich abbaye we will make
For our dear ladies sake
And lands give there till
We will pray her son so fair
That we may get a good air
Our land to welde at will
They let make an abbaye tho
The lady wexte with children two
As hit was gods will fre
At the last hit befell tho
The lady was delivered of of children two
That semely was to se
Tythynges came to the emperor
There he lay in his toure
A glad man was he
Two ladies brought him word
They had gifts that were good
The had both gold and fe
The emperor rose with mylde mode
To his chapel there he youde
He thanked god of his sonde
Erly or any day did spring
He made a pressed mass to sing
His mother there he found
Sone she said I am full blythe
That the empress shall have her live
And live with us in land
But much sorrow dredeth me
That Rome shall wrong arrayed be
And in straugne men's hand
Mother he said why say ye so
Now I have men children two
I thank god of his sonde
Nay she said sone mine
Well I wot they are not thine
It lyketh me full ill in land
For thou myghtest no children have
Thy wife has taken a cokes knave
I will hit prove by skyll
A sorrow to the emperors heart came
That word might he speak none
She yede away full still
To her chamber forth she yode
The emperor still at mass stood
As a man that was in care
The emperors mother called a knave
And hight him gifts for to have
A.C. pound and more
To thempeoours cambre ye knave take ye way
There the empres in chyldebed lay
Aslepe was she there
For why she had waked so long
In pain and in care strong
Or she delivered were
Have the with all thy might
Preuely that thou were vndyght
And that thou be vncladde
Softely by her thou in crepe
That she wake not of her sleep
Full seek she is bestadde
Hastily was the knave vncladde
And in he went as she him badde
In to the rich bid
But ever the knave drew him away
Of the riches that on him lay
He was full sore adradde
To the emperor sown she went
And bad him come in good intent
At the mass there he stood
Sone if thou believe not me
The sothe may thou now se
To the chamber with her he yode
When he saw the sight than
A sorrow to his heart ran
That well nere he wexed wode
The grome he saw in the bed
The rich clothes were over him spredde
Of that gylte he thought not good
The lady lay fast on sleep
A doleful dreme began she mete
That was so light a wight
She thought that she was in a wilderness
In sorrow and in great heaviness
That she might have no sight
She thought there came fleing
A dragon with the fire brennynge
That all the world was light
And in his paues brunnynge blow
Up he took her children two
And away took his flight
Therewith the lady began to wake
A doulefull gronynge began she make
And she syghed full sore
The emperor sterte to the grome
The here in hand he hent anon
The heed he smete of there
In he keste it to the bed
The rich clothes were all to bledde
Of rich gold though it were
The great treason that there was wrought
The lady slepte and knew it naught
Her dyscomfort was the more
Word of this they spoke no mo
Till the empress to church should go
As the law was in that led
The emperor made a feast I understand
To kings that were in diverse land
Of many alonde of far stead
The king of Calebre without las
That the empress father was
Theder began him bid
All they sembled upon a day
With Joy and game and much play
To the church the lady yode
The kings dwellyde there in same
There was both Joy and game
At that rich dynere
with good metes and drynkes among
Of harp lute and good song
Lute and good sautre
Till the seven days weee all gone
with all welthes in that wone
And myr^h of mynstre^sy
There was never so rich a gaderynge
That had so sorry a departing
I shall tell you why
Great dole it was to tell
Upon a day how it befell
Harken and ye may here
The emperor to his chamber yode
And his knights about him stood
With a full glad chere
The emperor said I understand
Such adventure was in that land
By a lady as ye shall here
All that treason he told them sone
And asked what Judgment should be done
And what she worthy were
When the emperor had his tale told
The king of calebre answered bold
He wist not what it meant
Sir he said for her sake
A great fire I shall do make
This is my Judgment
When the fire is brounynge fast
She and her children to be cast
To death for to be burnt
The emperor answered full sone
Thy own daughter has this done
I hold to mine assente
There was dole and great pity
A fire they made without the cite
With brondes brennynge bright
To the fire they laid the lady there
Two squyers her children did bear
That semely were to sight
In a kyrtell of scarlet reed
To the fire they led her to be deed
All ready she is dyght
The king of calebre made evil chere
For sorrow might not stand his daughter nere
There wept both king and knight
The lady saw no better reed
But she must needs be deed
That day in the field
With sorry heart the sothe to tell
Before the emperor on knees she fell
And both her hands up held
Grant me lord for Ihesus sake
That I might a prayer make
To him that all shall welde
And than to do with me your will
What death that ye will put me till
Thereto I will me yield
The lady on her knees her set
And Ihesu christ often she great
No wonder though she was woe
She said lord and king of bliss
This day thou will me read and wysshe
And heaven queen also
Maid mary mother fre
My prayer will I make to the
For my children two
As thou let them be borne of me
Grant that they may crystened be
Or they to death should go
Kings and queen's that about were
And ladies fell in sownynge there
And knights stood weeping
The emperor stood her full nere
The teres fell down on his lere
Full sorry he did there stand
The emperor spoke a word of pity
Dame he said thy death I will not se
With heart ne with hand
The emperor gave her leave to go
And took her her children two
And badde her go out of the land
The emperor gave her forty pound
Of florences that were read and round
In geste as we now read
He commanded her knights two
Out of the land her for to lead tho
The two knights her children bare
To what land that she leuest were
She was full sore aferde there
The king from the parlyament
Every lord to his own land went
And there dwelled with good entente
For sorrow their hertes began blede there
That lady came in to a wilderness
That full of wild beestes was
The wood was strong and thycke
The knights took the lady her children two
And took her gold and bade her go
As the way lay full right
They bade her hold the hye street
For dread with wild beestes for to mete
That much were of might
Again the knights went with sorry mode
Alone the empress forth yode
As a woeful wight
She had so wept here beforne
That her right way she had forlorn
So much she was in thought
In a wood that was full thycke
What for hills and leaves eke
Her way found she naught
In a sloughe under an hill
Sown she found a fair well
And an arbere ready wrought
With olyue trees the arbere was set
The lady set her down and wept
Ferther go she ne might
The lady by the well her set
With doleful chere and heavy heart
She might no ferther gone
Lord she said of heaven bliss
This day thou me read and wysshe
God send me some socoure sown
Maid mary mother fre
My prayer will I make to the
To amend my sorefull moan
I am full of sorrow and care
And three days I have gone and more
That mete had I none
By that she had her children dyhgt
Forsothe it was full nere the night
As she satte by the well
In the arbere down she lay
Till it was light of the day
That fowls began sing and yell
THere came an ape to seek his pray
One of her children he bare away
Up ^^^o one hye hill
No w^nder if she were woe
The ape bare her child her fro
In swonynge down she fell
In all the sorrow that the lady in was
There came rennynge a wild lyonas
That was in deed there
In a sownynge as the lady lay
Her other child she bare away
Her dyscomforte was the more
The lady was full heavy there
For the wild beestes away her children bear
For sorrow her heart began blede
To Ihesu christ. she made her moan
And syghynge forth she yode
There came a foul fair of flight
A gryffon he was called hy right
Over the hills hoar
The foul was so much of might
That he would well bear a knight
All armed if he were
The lioness and the child up took he
And flewe in to an isle of the se
Both with him he bare
The child slepte in the lioness mouth
Of well or woe it ne cowth
But god keep it from care
When the lioness had foot on land
Stowtely she can up stand
As be that was strong and wild
Thoroughe gods grace the gryffon she slew
And of his flesh ete enough
And laid her by the child
The child souked the lyones
As it gods will was
And the pappes began to welde
The lyones began of the child much make
And all for her whelps sake
She was therewith full mylde
With her foot she scraped a den
And brought the young child therein
And kept it day and night
When the lyones hongred sore
She ete of the gryffon evermore
That was so strong and wight
And as it was gods will
The lyones loved the child full well
That was so sayre and bright
The lady set her on a stone
To Ihefu christ she made her moan
As a woeful wight
Ihesu christ king of bliss
This day thou me read and wysshe
Of all kings thou art flower
As I was kings daughter and queen
And empress of Rome has been
And of many a rich toure
Through this treason that on me is wrought
To much sorrow I am brought
And out of my honor
This words life I have forlorn
And my two children from me borne
This life I may endure
A lord the sorrow that I am in
well I wot it is for my sin
welcome be all thy sonde
To the world I will me never give
But serve the lord whiles I live
Receive me with thy hand
Down by a hill the way she found
And to the greek see she came
And went by the stronde
Before her an haven she saw
And a cite with toures gaye
The ready way she found
which brought her to the town
A ship she found ready bowne
with pilgrims for to fare
She bad the shypmen gold and fe
with that she might therein be
If that thery will were
A boat the set upon the flode
And rowed to the land there the lady stood
A wight man in he bare
By the mast they bade her sytte
Of her woe no man might wit
But ever she wept full sore
The shypmen failed by an isle side
The master badde them they should abide
For fresshe water had they none
Beside them there was a roche on hye
And a well streme rennynge by
Come rennynge over a stone
Than two men to land they send
And sown to the well streme they wend
The well they found as I you said
The lioness lay in her den
And was full glad of these two men
Full sown she had them slain
So long at an anchor began the ride
These two men for to abide
Till noune was of the day
Twelve men began them dyght
With helm and with halbarde bright
To the land went they
They found the lioness in her den
And a man child they saw therein
With the lioness began play
Somwhyle he souked the lioness pap
And other while began kiss and clap
For dread they flede away
They went again and told what they saw
And how they found a roche on hye
And in the isle a lioness den
And there the lioness began to play
With a child that there in lay
And did slay both their men
The lady said that was so mylde
Mercy lords that is my child
And on land let me ryue
Abote they set upon the flode
Alone the lady forth youde
Full sore wept all they then
When she came to the roche on hye
She ran as fast as she might hye
With full sorry mode
The lioness thoroughe gods grace
When she saw the ladies face
Full fair and still she stood
Thoroughe the might of mary mylde
She suffered the lady to take her child
And to the sea with the lady she yode
when the shypmen the lioness se
They durst not come the land nigh
For fere they were nere wode
Some hente an ore / and some hente a spete
This wild lioness for to mete
Out of the boat for to were
The lady in to the ship they hente
Therty fo^e after che lioness sprente
Therc durst no man cum him nere
There durst no man cum him nere
There might men se game and gle
Four men lepe into to the sea
So aferde they were of the lioness there
By the lady the lioness lay
And with the child began play
And no man would she dear
The shypmen drew up sail of rich hew
The wind from land them blewe
Over that wanne streme
The first land that they might se
was a cite with toures hye
That hight Iherusalem
Full blythe they were of that sight
As is the foul when it is light
Of that day leme
When hit was ebb and no flode
The shypmen and the lady to land yode
In that rich realm
Over all the cite wide and long
Of that lady the word spronge
That there to land was lent
And how she had a lioness
Brought with her out of wilderness
The king after her sent
The king bade let for no thing
But the lioness with the lady to bring
To a castle there nere hand
When she to the king come
For the empress of rich rome
The king full well her knew
The king her frayned of her fare
And she told him of her care
As a woeful wight
Then with the queen she dwelled still
And had maidens at her will
To serve her day and night
The child that was fair and fre
The king made him crystened be
And said that Octauyan shall hight
When the child was of elde
That he could ride and arms welde
The king dubbed him a knight
The lioness that was so wild
Dwells with the lady mylde
Her comfort was the more
The lady dwelled still with the queen
With Joy and game them between
To cover her of her care
Every day he served that lady bright
To make her glad with all his might
Till she better mended were
In Iherusalem that lady dwelled still
Of that other child tell you I will
That the ape from her bare
THere came an ape that was so wild
Thorough the forest with the child
The holtes was both hye and hoar
As the ape came over the street
With a knight began she mete
The child as she bare
Tho fanght the kynght full long
Agaynest the ape that was so strong
His sword he brake there
The ape left the child and away went
The knight from her the child hente
And with him began he fare
Forth with the child he rode then
And in a forest he met outlawes ten
That much were of might
The knight was never so woe
That his sword was broke in two
That he might not fight
If the knight were never so woe
The outlawes wane the child him fro
That was so stout and wight
The knight was wounded that day
Vnethys his horse bare him away
So dolefully he was dyght
The outlawes set them on the grene
And laid the child them between
The child was fair and on them loughe
The master outlawe said then
It were great shame for hardy men
The child if we it slew
I read we bear it with much pride
To Iherusalem here beside
And do hit no harm
It is so fair and gentle bore
That we may have tresoure therefore
Gold and silver full yarne
The two outlawes made them yare
To Iherusalem for to fare
It was so sweet awyght
There was no man that the child se
For dole they wept with their eye
So fair he was to sight
A burgeys of paris came full nere
That palmer had been seven year
Clement lunlayne he hight
He said lordynges will ye the child sell
Ye for monaye if ye will to us it tell
Florences broad and bright
For fyfty pound sell him they would
Clement said long ye may him hold
Or ye him so sell may
I swear by mine hode
I wene can but little good
Such words for to say
Gold and silver is to me need
But.xx.li. I will you bid
And make you ready pay
The child they him sold
And.xx.li. he them told
And went forth his way
When clement had the child bought
He made a panyer to be be wrought
The child therein to lead
He took him the way right
And asked him with all his might
What was his best reed
A norse he gate him also
In to france with him to go
The child for to feed
The burgeys of paris were full feign
Full, many went clement again
All rent was his wede
THey clepte him and kyst him all
And brought him home in to the hall
His wife was full blythe
She frayned him the right dome
How that he by the child come
He told her full swythe
Dame in Iherusalem I hit get
And there I would him not let
The sothe I will you lythe
His wife answered with heart mylde
Sir it shall be my own child
She kyste it many a sithe
Dame said clement while I palmer was
I gate this child with my flesh
In the hethen land
In to this land I have him brought
Wherefore dame grieve the naught
For rich shall be thy wede
She answered him with words fre
He is welcome to me so mote I the
For fair I shall him feed
And keep him with our own child
Till he become of elde
And clothe them in one wede
Clement was thereof full blythe
He did christian the child swythe
It dwelled but a night
Anon after they him calde
Florent the child hight
When the child was seven year old
He was fair wise and bold
The man that redeth right
In all the realne wide and long
Of the child the word spronge
So fair he was by sight
Ever the burgeys and his wife
Loved the child as their life
With him he was full dear
When he was seven year and more
Clement set the child to lore
To be a chauncelere
Than clement betoke to Florent oxen two
And badde him over the byrdge to go
To a bocher as ye shall here
To learn the craft to do
As his kind was never to do so
Such games for to lere
Florent over the byrdge began go
Fast dryuynge his oxen two
He saw a semely sight
A squire there was as I you tell
A gerfaucon he bare to sell
With feathers fold full right
Florent to the squire youde
And both his oxen to him bode
For that faucon bright
The squire was wonder blythe
And gave to him the faucon swythe
With heart good and light
The squire hasted him full swythe
His oxen away for to drive
That he were out of sight
And florent to fle was full feign
He wend he would have his faucon again
He ran with all his might
He went him home the next way
To clementes house as it lay
And he in went full right
He feed the faucon whiles he would
And sithe his fair feathers fold
As the sqyer had him taught by sight
Clement the burgeys came en full sown
Traitor where have thou the oxen down
That I took the full right
Great dole men might se there
Clement beat the child full sore
That was so sweet a wight
With other mete thou shall not live
But that this kyte will the give
Both by day and by night
As sore beten as the child stood
yet to his faucon he youde
His feathers for to right
Clementes wife thought wonder thore
That clement beat him so sore
He asked his fader why
Father said the child for crystes ore
Be in peace and beat me no more
But you wot why
Would ye now a while behold
Howt fair he does his feathers fold
And how lovely they lie
Ye would pray to god with mylde mode
That you had soulde half your good
Such one for to bye
The burgeys wife beside stood
Full sore she rued in her mode
And said for thine ore
For marys love that maid mylde
Have mercy on your fair child
And beat him no more
Let him be at home and serve us two
And let our other sone out go
Each day for to lere
Such grace for him may be wrought
To a better man he may be brought
Than he a bocher were
After all this hit befell
Clement began forty pound to tell
In his chamber there
Clement took it to child florent
And to the bridge he him sent
The monaye his brother to bear
As the child thorough the cite yede
He saw where stood afayre stead
That was strong in every stout
The stead was white as any milk
The brydell raynes were of sylke
The molens were all gylde
Of words the child was wonder bold
He asked how the stead should be sold
The monaye would he tell
The man badde him for thyrty pound
Of florences read and round
No less he would him sell
Florent said to little it wore
Ten pound I shall give the more
And ten pound he than told in faye
The squire was wonder blythe
And took the silver to him full swythe
And hasted him away
Florent lepte lepte up for to tide
To clementes house with much pride
And took the hye way
He thought to ride in at the hall
He sought none other stall
He set him up there in faye
Florent was glad as I you say
And gave his stead corn and hay
He kneled down and fair him dyght
