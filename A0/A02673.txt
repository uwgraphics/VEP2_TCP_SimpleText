LONDON Printed for John Busby the elder.

(...) he loved, and rejoice in the son that has sinned and laments.

But to my purpose, having in so many voyages gone forth and returned so
successively and to approve, that the state of fortune, is like the spokes of a
wheel, that is carried as well downward as upward, that this worldly felicity
joys and pleasure, in which we so trust: which we study to know, labor to
purchase, and are so careful to keep, ^re but like the day that is given us to
use, and vanishes away even in the growing* That while we think we stand sure
on the pynackles of Fortune, we are on the sudden overthrown to lie
gr^ueling in shame, pleasure and sorrow, being indeed twins (as shall appear
by me) the one no sooner hatched, but the other is at hand to s^plant her, and
therefore I may fitly compare man's happiness here to a fruitles smile, the
which is presently turned into sorrow and tears: ^e a dream, the joy whereof
vanishes even as we wake: to a painted Sepulcher, fair without and putrified
within, or to a Siren beautiful in show and deceit^ul to entice, glorious
above to bewitch you with gasing, but l^oke down to the hinder part, to the
bot^ome of that which he^re we ran mad for, we shall find this tempting fair
to have the tail of a Scorpion, who in the handling gives such a blow* that it
benummeth our bodies, and the sense of understanding, and stingeth our souls
with an irrecou^rable death.

For while I thus wallowed in my inclination, mastred by my affections, and
making my felicity out of others men's miseries, while I thought prosperity at
sea, as sure in my gripe, as the power to speak was free to my tongu^, my
actions were ^o imboldened, and my heart so hardened, that I held if a cowardice
to despair to attempt, and effeminacy to pity whosoever did perish. So that
my fortunes, like a byas-bowle, being all this while thrown up a hill, and
gained not the top o^ safety, whereon it might rest, it must of force fall
down again. So I feareles to venture, and dreadles of danger, in the
straights meeting with the Turks Galleys* well appointed in a man of war, my
surprised prise, waiting my beck, and making for B^stow, the Turks road up to
me I was soon ha^ld, but my ordnance made answer, and disdayning so much as to
give them friendly words, in regard my desperate boldenes thought me free from
their rage, we enterd fight, where what either was their encounter, or our
resistance, I will be partial to report: but the end was, I was taken
prisoner, conueid to Tunes, from a Christian transformd to a slave, had my head
and face shaven, and in their needful service, as an enforced wretch, could
striking, blows brusing, and hunger pinching, I was compeld to row in their
Galleys: necesstiy has no resistance, and to this misery I was enforced to
obey three year^s, when I continued it out, some of the time with wind, water
and b^owes, brusing me at the seas, and the other part with Iron and hunger,
torturde a shore.

In all which time, I had occasion enough offered me, to have laid repentance
at my heart, to have sorrowed for my iniquities past, and to have vowed to my
conscience, that if ever God were the blessed worker, to redeem me from this
thraldom and captinitie, without whose help, I lay groueling and desperate, I
would account that minut the hour of my birth, and so consecrate my after life
to the obeying of his will, that I would convert my violence to patience, my
Tyranny to temperancee. all my vices to virtues, and re^orme my ^ife to his
blessed word, when on the contrary this affliction of my body, did not so
chastise my mind, that I imputed this correction, to be laid upon me by the
hand of heaven, as a just whip for my offenses past, but the continuance
thereof did so harden my heart, so fire my spleen, and inflate my spirit, that
I vowed my liberty gained, should be to others loss, my freedom prove fatal
to other men's good haps, and that if ever I had again the swindge of my wit,
which was to command must have their wills, and they have wills may reprove
whatsoever I say. Then since the law as from the fountain of my offenses,
has had power to draw my life from me, and the world even after my death, may
have a strength to condemn me, words uttered with tears but request of them
this, that since my body shall have power to blunt the edge of affliction, my
fall may have force to abate the keen sharpness of their rumoring tongues:
and if any thirsty or unsatisfied spleen either rejoicing at my fall o^
bemoning my ruin, shall desire to see vnraueled the whole web of my life, here
shall he behold the piece of my travails wherein I desire him to wash from his
memory the stains of my name, here shall he read my diurnall transgressions,
which I request him to pardon and not to reprove, since no curre is so cruel
to bite the dead, here as in a mirror shall he^ look into my miseries
handyworke, my sin, my sorrow, my life, my death, and the building of my own
labor, begun from the time I was brought by the Sherefe of Middlesex to
Newgate, wrought upon in the Marshalseyes, and conclude most untimely at
Wapping.

For my place of birth then I must call it in Bristoll where my education was
such, as did credit my loving and careful father, and was obeyed by me as a
dutyfull son: I grew up like a straight plant, and was expected of the
worthiest of that City, and hoped sor of the best of my country, to have
proved the timber of a fruitful tree: my company to our gentry was accounted
so welcome, that they esteemed me for pleasure, more then expenses, and the
contempt I held to assosiate with the base, had brought my fair de^aner to be
beloved of the best. So that my fellowship entirely desired, and my condition
held honest, my father was proud to call me his happy son.

In which flourishing expectation in my youth soiourned in Bristoll, where I so
far prevailed in the love of our Merchants, that I was soon encouraged to
go to sea, the first employment I undertook was more to see the state and
fashions of foreign countries, and to enrich my understanding with experience,
then any greedines of gain, to strengthen riotte. So that in her late
memorable majesty's reign, when the division of league was between this
kingdom and Spain, I went but Purser sent forth in a man of War of
Bristoll* in which charge of mine how careful I governed, let my own hand
neglect to record, and the Merchants themselves when my body is in dust,
impartially report, I never returning home but with sails of success
profitable to the venturers, comfort to my father, and credit to his son:
whereby from degree to degree deserving advancement I was at length set forth
as Captain my self, in which command ab oad how manly I swayed let my
enemies pratie that have felt me at sea: which credit lent me, how well I
repaid, let Bristoll speak, that in this my extremity has labour^ my peace
and pardon (even with the price of eight hundred pound) felt of my purchase and
feasted my pains.

I have sat with the Aldermen when my fathar has wept to hear them
discourse, and the tears he has shed (against the nature of childhood) has
encouraged my valor as if I would say, father of me thou shall weep again.
But death must have no praises, and though success being like a spring tide,
that rolls so high, till it ouerflow the bounds, I was as auidous to go to
war, as my stomach hungry I had an appetite to eat: I complaind of nothing,
for I held my wounds the banners of heraldry borne before me to my grave, and
all my study was how to make my father in his death but be comforted by his
son, and the son to rejoice as in such a father. Your pity Reader then is
but this, neither of father nor of son: pity the father, that has lost him
he loved, and rejoice in the son that has sinned and laments.

But to my purpose, having in so many voyages gone forth and returned so
successively and to approve, that the state of fortune, is like the spokes of a
wheel, that is carried as well downward as upward, that this worldly felicity
joys and pleasure, in which we so trust* which we study to know, labor to

on the pynackles of Fortune, we are on the sudden overthrown to lie
groueling in shame, pleasure and sorrow, being indeed twins (as shall appear
by me) the one no sooner hatched, but the other is at hand to s^ plant her, and
therefore I may fitly compare man's happiness here to a fruitles smile, the
which is presently turned into sorrow and tears: te a dream, the joy whereof
vanishes even as we wake: to a painted Sepulcher, fair without and putrified
within, or to a Siren beautiful in show and deceitful to entice, glorious
above to be witch you with gasing, but look down to the hinder part, to the
bottom of that which here we ran mad for, we shall find this tempting fair
to have the tail of a Scorpion, who in the handling gives such a blow* that it
benummeth our bodies, and the sense of understanding, and stingeth our souls
with an irrecouerable death.

For while I thus wallowed in my inclination, mastred by my affections, and
making my felicity out of others men's miseries, while I thought prosperity at
sea, as sure in my gripe, as the power to speak was free to my tongue, my
actions were fo imboldened, and my heart so hardened, that I held if a cowardice
to despair to attempt, and effeminacy to pity whosoever did perish. So that
my fortunes, like a byas-bowle, being all this while thrown up a hill, and
gained not the top of safety, whereon it might rest, it must of force fall
down again. So I feareles to venture, and dreadles of danger, in the
straights meeting with the Turks Galleys* well appointed in a man of war, my
surprised prise, waiting my beck, and making for Bostow, the Turks road up to
me I was soon ha^, but my ordnance made answer, and disdayning so much as to
give them friendly words, in regard my desperate boldenes thought me free from
their rage, we enterd fight, where what either was their encounter, or our
resistance, I will be partial to report: but the end was, I was taken
prisoner, conueid to Tunes, from a Christian transformd to a fl^ue, had my head
and face shaven, and in their needful service, as an enforced wretch, could
striking, blows brusing, and hunger pinching, I was compeld to row in their
Galleys: necesstiy has no resistance, and to this misery I was enforced to
obey three years, when I continued it out, some of the time with wind, water
and blows, brusing me at the seas, and the other part with Iron and hunger,
torturde a shore.

In all which time, I had occasion enough offered me, to have laid repentance

chast^e my mind, that I imputed this correction, to be laid upon me by the
hand of heaven, as a just whip for my offenses past, but the continuance
thereof did so harden my heart, so fire my spleen, and inflate my spirit, that
I vowed my liberty gained, should be to others loss, my freedom prove fatal
to other men's good haps, and that if ever I had again the swindge of my wit,
which was to command at sea, my fortunes should aspire to their ^ormer
eminence and my pleasure grow to their an^ient scope, or my body should fall
for it.

But see ^he just will of the heavens (and be forewarnd by my fall you
succeeding ages) that I should be the Prophesierto my self of my own mishap,
and the fatal raven to c^oke out mine own ruin.

For while I lay plunged in this sea of affliction, cloide with misery and
without hope of relief, It fortuned one Captain Bishop, with a wealthy prise
he had then taken, to put in for Tunes, and in a small time having made sale of
his goods, he having (by what rumor I never v^derstood) ha^ intelligence of my
thraldom there, of my extreme usage, and in^ortunat mishap, of his own free
nature he enquired me out, and demanded of me if I were that Captain Harris so
talked of in Bristow, who had been so fortunate to enrich others, and was now
dejected in this misfortune my self? when having little pleasure to hear my
praises spoken, or unmindful to renew their memory by talk, but rather
desirous of some comfort to supply my present want, although I ever held it a
contemptible baseness to beg: he demanded twice ere I made him an answer,
till at length, the report of the place, my mother, country, nurse, and raiser,
and the present memory of my ancient father, being by his question put in my
mind, I resolved him thus:

What I was he witnessed, what I had been by his own tongue belike had heard,
what I might be (unless a dead man) in my present case he could hardly guess,
yet not-withstandnig all this, I was borne at Bristoll: who bring struck
presently with an in-ward pity, to se^ me lie chayned inso miserable a case, so
deformed without hatre on my head or face, so ghastly in show, so hollow-eyd,
and so pined away in flesh, I might perceive the tears to startle in his eyes,
while his hand privately into mine put five ducats, and departing the prison,
he spoke to me thus, be of good cheer Sir, God has in store, in our greatest
need, and friends no doubt but will be your help, when I, not without cause,
thanking him for his present courtesy, without demanding his name, or little
expecting his kindenes succeeded, for that instant we were both divided.

When Capta^ne Bishop, as he has often related unto me since, being ^eturned
back to his chamber, he was struck with a forcible impression to the heart in
pity of my state, and the oftener remembering what Bristoll had spoke of me, he
vowed to his soul he would prove my ^nlarger, if all the riches he had but
lately brought in, might purchase my ransom, with which courtesy of his (oh let
no man forbid me to commend him, although for his offenses like mine he
deserves to be condemned) he neither telling me of his purpose, feeding my
hope* or flattering my expectation, he so labourd with the Crosimon and
Governors of Tunis, that for three hundred d^ukets, which he franckly paid ere
I knew by what means or by whom I was set at liberty, when in a generous
disposition, inuiting me to his lodging I had my entertainementin such form,
as my present fortunes had equald his, where in regard of my long captivity, he
was as my Physician, to minister to my health, allowing me all means possible,
and commanding withal that nothing were wanting might repair my body to a
strengthened estate: which when I found to be in my self, as he had perfectly
enabled me within, (according to my degree, and the dignity of his bounty)
with variety of suits he repaird me without, so that one day after being alone
together, being iocund and frolic, for in all societies he accounted me his
friend and companion, he on a suddainebrake with me thus.

Captain Harris what say thou my heart, how art thou resolved man, whether
as occasion shall offer thee, to make for England, and there to be held bold
and beholding to thy old, but wavering acquaintance, or to abide with me, and
venture thy fortunes with thy certain friend. It is not strange unto thee, that
since the late death of her memorable majesty, our most royal Sovereign, and
his prudent and grave counsel, on approved considerations best known to his
grace and the state, and not requisite for us that are subjects to enquire,
has lessend by this general peace the flourishing employment, that we
sea^aring men do bleed for at sea: In those ^aies of bickering (quoth he) we
have spent our hours in a high flood, and it will be unsavory for us now, to
pick up our crumbs in a low ^bbe: to live in baseness, and want means even to
sustain nature, to walk under the check of some such as have pearkt up their
heads to authority in this time of quiet, whom we durst have buffeted I and
their heirs too in days of war. Then say, if for England thou resoluest thy
course, such is my love to thy welfare, I will not leave thy company, till I
see thee ashore, and then leave me to shift for my self, But it with me and my
love to thee, thouwilt fasten thy fortunes, I will call thee my brother, and in
the riches I have gained I will make thee a sharer.

With which speech of his, having had intelligence that his purchase was great,
seeing his riot and expenses huge, and having found his courtesy toward my
misery manifest, I f^und my inclination yielding, and was almost caught at the
first angling, yet for that instant, I desired some small respite, to consider
of his will, and to my request he as soon consented.

In which respite, nothing diminishing his bounty, nor neglecting his former
favor, for his purse was as open to me as to himself, it happened that one
Captain Gilbert Roup while Captain Bishops ships anchord in the road, and he
with his men did revel* shore, with a rich prise he had lately taken, was come
also to Tunis: between whom their acquaintance being former, there was no
neglect of gratulatio^s in the highest imbracement, and my company at the
present was welcometo both: when again, Captain Bishops, in the presence of
Captain Roup, began to solicit me in his former purpose whose words were by
Captain Roupe as readily secu^ded and theeir persuasions so enlarged* being as
I thought bound even to my life, by the courtesy of the one, and fyred now also
with the riches the other had brought in, neither of them were so ready to ask
of my consent as I of free will was foreward to grant: whose company both of
them seeming with gladness to be welcomed, Captain Roupe having made sale of
his commodities, Captain Bishop and my self reuelling out the time with him,
a ship well mand and provided for me, and we three combind together in one
faction: let the reader think we a^e now at sea, where we thriued so
succesfully that I blu^h to report the rapine that the hands of so few did
execute on the bodies and substance of many: only this that part of the
purchase in this voyage we had gain^ we made sale off at Sophi, and
Sancta-cruci in Barbary, and the remainder with out sails we conueid to Tunis,
when Captain Bishop, finding himself not per^ectly in health, after his ease
and superfluous reuelling here a shore, nine shares of our pillage being
divided between him, Captain Roup and my self, he was contented for a while
to continue at Tunis, and Captain Roupe prepared his ship to put off again for
Sophy in Barbary, where I heard imediatly after, he met and consorted with
Captain Iennings: and I on the other side rigging my vessel, and redying my
men: Captain Bishop then, neither deducting any part out of my share for the
ship at his own charge he had furnished forth for me, I now put forth for a
voyage my self. When encountering with rough winds, and unseasonable tempests,
and my men many of them falling sick, and in their sickness perished, with
the best expedition that experience could teach, with the rest which remained,
we made way for the coast of Ireland, and ere long we anchored in Baltimore,
where finding yt coast clear, our ariuall out of danger, and our
entertainment free, we there repaired and fresh victuald our ship, and there
received in the most part of my present company namely John Spencer, and Thomas
Spencer brothers, Samuel Read, and Richard Baker: the rest which I then took
in, being not now taken, and in hope they may live to do their King and
country better service, I hope no indifferent man, will condemn me for
concealing their names. With whose assistance being again strengthened and my
ship in fresh plight, I put on for the coast of Spain, where nere the Islands
of Meuera, I met with a french ship called the Margaret of Maruill, sailing
from Lisborne whose chiefest lading was sugar, twixt whom and us, there was no
great encounter, before my frenchman (although he seemed somewhat hot at the)
first began to submit, whom we presently boorded and ransacking her lading
(which as before we discoured was but sugers) we found her beneath to be better
stuffed then above, for at the bottom of her hold we took out eight thousand
french crowns, and so much of her chiefest lading, as we thought fit for our
present sale and burden, giving the ship back to the Master to make for
France, or without offering to him or his men any other hurt. After which
keeping still at sea, I met with a Duch ship, of a far greater burden then
my own I was Captain of, whom I gessing more auailable for me in the
enterprise I had in hnad, I compelled him to change with me, more for fear
then for love, and so gave them leave to depart without further outrage: the
tenth of May following and in this present year of his majesty's reign, I met
also with another french ship, called the Mary, of a Merchant of Saint Malos
laden with wine, twixt whom and us there was a small fight, but their
resistance being in vain, she was made our own: when Jerome Lockey a fellow
though poor in show yet he was cruel at sea and foreward in fight, who
getting down into the hold (before I had notice) and the ship had yielded,
when meeting the Merchant, and perceiving his lading to be nothing but wines
(not of my knowledge I protest before God) he took three or four cable ends
and most cruelly I confess abused the Frenchman, to make him express what
other lading then was extant in sight, his vessel contained? who straight
brought him to eight hundred Dollers so conningly hid, without which course I
faithfully believe we should never have found them. And which sum I must
grant he presented to me, the coin I deny not but I willingly received, yet I
neglected not to check him for abusing the man. Which ship, and the riches of
the Margarite I had taken before, for as yet I had made no sale of her goods, I
had advised my master Peter Brush and though I say a skillful mariner, to bend
his course again for Ireland, and expressly for Baltimor: the course was by
him and in general disliked, since we had been their so lately and my name so
fresh in memory about the coast, although not as yet proclaimed for a Pirat:
but see the will of Heaven, that against all persuasion I should bea maine
furtherer of mine own ruin and the overthrow of my men, for no persuasion nor
resistance would alter me, but our course must be readily for Baltimore.

But see how it happened, the Frenchman whom I first took in the Margarit and
the Duch also whom I compelled to change ships with me, having made for
England, had delivered my name and injury done unto them, to the right
honorable of the Council, as also that not long before their surprisal I had
made my reside and victualed my ship at Baltimor, the which belike amongst
diverse talk some or other of my men had made known to them, which their
Lordships understanding, and to prevent such outrages committed to their
neighbor nations and friends with whom they had league, they presently caused
one of the Kings majesty's ships, over whom Sir William Saint John was
Captaiue, not so much alone to scour the coast, and surprise me, as to prevent
that place, to be a nourisher and aid to any such offenders in that case as my
self. Which Gentleman, in the Kings ship lying at road, had intelligencers lay
upon the mountains in the mouth of the harbor, who were always ready to give
him instructions of the near arrival of any man of war, or other ship
whomsoever: when to my fate it so untimely happened, that I was the first, and
the spies by the bearing our topsaile and conducting our prise, had given him
to understand for certain, there was a man of war coming in, who presently
caused his ship should be haled up close under a place called Justice Crookes
Castle, where she was impossible to be descried, and least our espial should
make us keep off: So that we were on the sudden fallen withinhis command, and
impossible to retire ere that we had any notice to be forewarnd, or power to
resist our danger, in which distress not without much terror perceiving our
case, upon his first sommons we yielded our selves, when Sir William Saint
John caused his long boat to be sent out to us, and himself in person came us
aboard unto whom I did (as (at my arraignment) we all resolved to plead this
excuse,) that being as true it is, I was prisoner in Tunis, and from that
thraldom released by Captain Bishop, I was bound to obey him, and all that I
did was under his command, that at our last watering at Ballimor, Captain
Bishop was in our company, which now I must confess to be an untruth, and that
there by his constraint and sleights, most of my men being brought aboard and
by him compelled to undertake this business we having now got this advantage, in
a sudden storm and grown sea to loose his company, our purpose of coming
in was to yield our selves: not doubting but his majesty in commisseration of
my estate being never detected before, bought from a slave, Bishop being Lord
of me, and compeld to his will, I should sooner obtain his mercy, in which
Kings bear the tipes to be Gods on earth, then the rigor of Justice, which
has power to condemn my wretched yet innocent life, and that himself whose
worthiness I had heard of, would be so gracious a friend to the integrity of
our cause, that my men also, whom I then protested to be compeld to the action,
since we all yielded without any violence offered, himself would be the
testimony in our behalf: Who very wisely contested unto us, that so far as
our dealings had been honest, and our justification true, he would be our
friend to the utmost, and our foe in no part: so seazing upon our ship and
goods and imprisoning my self and company, we were by his commission directed
from Baltimor to Dublin, from Dublin to Bristoll, where my friends morsorrowed
to see me now, then ever they rejoiced to be hold me before, yet never
neglected to visit my company, allowing me means to bear me like a Gentleman,
nor ceasing since both with purse and pains to have recovered my peace.

But what be fore I had so cunningly excused, by the provident and searching
eye of the Council, was found to be faulty, andrruth being waighed in the
scailes of Justice we were found too light, so that having remained twenty
days in Bristoll, I was from thence from Shiriffe to Shiriffe directed to
Newgate, my brother coming along and bearing me company, who laboring like
the careful Be in my business never idle, soliciting here and laboring
there, and who had hopeful expectation and promises I should find mercy that
had for my offenses deserved none, I built not yet my trust on so shaking a
foundation, but although to supply the company of mymultitude of friends whose
love came daily to visit me, I bare an outside of mirth, I h ad a heart piece of
sorrow, and considering in my thoughts how I had wronged the stranger, and
those whose losses I could never right, how I had undone many and had but a
lifeto satisfy all, I desired not now to build, for that where I might not
continue, but labor for that where I should live for ever. I thought it not
requisite now, to forget Heaven for earth, the soul for the body, nor
heavenly pleasures for temporal goods: I acknowledge now that in a worldly
building the stones must be broken, hewn and squared, ere they be fit to make
up the work: the corn must be thrashed, winnowed and purified before it be
ready for nourishing bread: the whirlewind must first blow ere Elias be rapt
into heaven, so every sinner must be cut, hewn and squared, with the blows
that beat upon his guilty conscience, be threashed wi nnowed and purified with
prayers, repentance and amendment of life: and sighs must make way both for
body and soul, if we mean ere to come to our heavenly Jerusalem. I remembered
now that vncookt meat is unwholesome for man, and unmortified men be no
creatures for God: which made me in my chamber in the hours of quiet alone,
never have the Pensiue-mans practice out of my hand, nor the penitent
mans-practise outof my heart: therefore I must say to him, it was vrgently done
who informed the Counsel, that the Saturday, be fore my trial and first
imprisonment in the Marshalsies and in my imprisonnement, my first meeting with
Captain Iennings, who at sea together did call brothers, and being with him
but orderly mercy, he reported to their Lordships we were mad drunk: this was
informed to be done, and whosoever did it, I must needs tell him it was but a
homely message, since it is no good nor charitable office to heap unjust
injuries upon miserable men: for I protest, I had that testimony in my self,
that my sorrow had washed away my foulness, and loathing my life I invited my
death, knowing there is no death where there is no sin, for by sin death
entered into the world, and the wages of sin is death, so that what I was to
loose, I was sure to loose as soon as I had life, but the life that I looked
for should never have death, which patience and resolution of mine, the
diligent Preacher that both labourd and found in me I doubt not (for truth) but
he will speak and confirm, which Christian end of mine I expect, that instead
of me it shall increase comfort in my friends, and be a sufficient satisfaction
to my adversaries, of whom on the bended knees of my heart I humbly crave
pardon, from whom being men I fear not denial, since I am sure it is sealed
of our Maker in heaven, and so from a free and unburdened heart, a patient
mind and willing steps, I go out of my chamber in the Marshalstes, the Friday
morning being the two and twenty day of December to make my deathbed at
Wapping.

Of whom Reader if thou destrest more, though he be the first of number placed
in the book, he was the last of seauenteene that suffered: first he made his
devotion and prayers with an affirmative tongue, threw away his hat as he went
bouldly up the ladder, and being demanded of a stranger stood by him, If as
yet he had heard no good news from the King? he answered him, none sir but
from the King of Kings: and therefore with Peter I must resolve and say I look
for a new heaven and a new earth, according to his promise wherein dwells
righteousness: he sung (to a syllable) the one and twenty Psalms, dyed a
repentant sinner and a Christian, and by the diligence of his natural brother,
was brought to the keeper of Newgates house in Newgatemarket, and from thence
as a Christian was buried in Christe-Church.

The discourse of Captain Iennings.
SInce you are thus far (gentle Readers) led on with this discourse of
Captain Harris, I doubt not but you will expect the like of the rest, which
cannot in Captain Iennings be so well performd as in the former, for the
education of his youth was ^o mean and low, he could neither write nor read,
yet notwithstanding it is not brought to your eyes under his own hand, the
report for certain was taken from his tongue, and thus it is.

From my childehood (quoth he) I was wholly addicted to martial courses,
espetially in the manly resolution of seafaringmen, I was not disaniamated at
the reports of others dangers past, nor afeard my self to encounter with
tempests to come, whereby in many voyages returning from Sea, I grew to bear
the name of a skillful Mariner, which so soon pu^t up a self conceit in my
thoughts, that I grew ambitious straight, to have a whole command, and held it
baseness to live under check. It likt me well a shipboard to see the Captain
but bid, and his will in all things was straight obeyed, and such a one in my
ambition I resolud to be, wc authority and place, finding my present means and
friends impossible lawfully to raise me unto, I bluntly resolved, as we use to
say, to attain to it then by hook or by crooks. To which purpose, comforting
my self with a retchles crew, and such as loved riot as well as my self (for
I must truly confess it was one of my sins) we were not long before we had
made up our company, furnished us of a ship, and by the name of Captain
Iennings I was known at Sea, so that in the Queens majesty's reign, during
the continuance of the dissension betwixt the King of Spain and the
Hollanders, I found such a safe refuge and retirement, into Dunkerk, after many
heinous spoils committed on their Dutch Fly-boates. Pinkes and passengers in
them, that my name grew so odious, my offenses so multiplied, that being known
to the state, I was proclaimd a Pyrate, and several ships both from England and
Holland, made out to lie in weight for my apprehention, which though long first
was at last so effected, that by the English I was taken, and brought prisoner
to the Marshalseys, expecting nothing but for my time of trial, and hoping for
nothing but present death.

When my loving sister so labourd with petitions to the states that lay here,
and to diverse Merchants, I had formerly wronged, wherein was my promise of
reformation of life, and vows of service to their country, which they both
knew, and I was certain I could able them in, proudly spoken of my self, that
not a man in Christendom could stop a leake under water better then I, and but
without boasting I could say hardly so well, which virtue known to them, with
other my many resolutions, they pitied my fall, were petitioners for me to the
Queen, contented themselves to sustain their loss by me, and twice by this
means they procurd my pardon, a grace from them so sufficient, that if I had
had grace to have conceiud it so, and made good use of their favors, my sins
had not been so many, my reputation more, my favor might have been greater,
and the contempt of me less, my service have still been held acceptable* and I
a good member in the common wealth: but see how I requited the last of their
graces. Namely not only my pardon procurde, paying my charges and setting me at
liberty, but also transporting me over, gave me command over a Flyboat, and in
their service sent me to sea, in which employment, my enterprises not thriuing
so successively as before, and the pride of my heart not stooping, but
co^temningto attend their reproof, who had saved my life, taking fit advantage
by the forehead, with their ship and furniture, and such men as I had drawn to
my part, I leave their service, intend now to serve for my self, and by this
(...) having taken a Spanish Caruell by the way, I am arrived at Sophie in
Barbary, where upon my arrival, upon some displeasure that was concein^
against other Pirates, concerning the breaking certain contractes they had
made with the Governor, and during the time of examining o^ my goods, I was
kept prisoner, but at length was released and ^ound such favor, that my prize
was sold to (...) best advantage, for which ^auour I not neglecting my
thankefulnes to the Governor, and diverse others I had found my friends, I was
contented to spend there the latter end of the year, in which time I came
acquainted with Captain Bishop and Captain Roupe, who did so combinde our
selves together, that the following spring we went forth, Bishop Admiral,
Roupe Uiceadmirall, and my self rearadmirall, where what purchase we took of
any nation in this voyage, still we returned and made sale of only at Sophie,
which amounting to so great a sum, it is incredible to report, I will only
satisfy you that the most part was consumed in excess: and so to this
discourse.

These prizes we had thus taken being here sold, there was some difference
fell betwixt us three concerning our shares, which dissension betw^ene Captain
Roup^ and my self was soon attoned: but Captain Bishop because we would not
yield he should have a full part more then us both, here we left company, and
Captain Roup^ and my self put forth to Sea for a voyage again, when after a
seven days sale; a leake sprung in Captain Roups ship, which growing so
forcible it could by no means be stopped, Captain Roupe and his company were
compeld to come aboard of mine, and his ship sunk immediately after.

Our strengths being thus confinde into one hold, w^ were by this time come to
the I^e of Silly, where we met with a ship called the John Evangelist, and
without much pains made her our prize, the twenty six of October immediately
following, and making for Ireland, we took als^ a french ship laden with
brass and other rich commodities, and so bearing up to Baltimor, we sent the
purse^ with the long boat a shore, to deal with the kernes for hogs to
victual withal, and under that pretense show them their bills of lading: for
it is to be understood, that this part of Ireland and the kernes the
inhabitants, have their best strength and support by the putting in and
nourishing o^ Pirates. It is also to be noted, that as soon as any Capta^e h^h
taken any ship, a calls to the Master for a bill of his lading, and demands
what belongs to the Merchant, what to the Master, and what to the Mariners? so
that if he leave them their ship, he takes away none but the Merchants goods,
and by this means he knows hereafter what he is driven to be accomptable for.

But to the purpose, having safely put in here to Baltimor made sale of her
goods they had then taken, and victuald their ship in readiness to depart,
Captain Iennings being a shore, it happened him to fall in liking with an
Irish woman, and what with gold and persuasion he so far prevailed with her,
that he won her to spend her company at Sea with him, and so hoysing sails
away they depart.

At whose going out of the road, his injuries being spread and whose name the
third time proclaimd a Pyrate, they happened upon one of the Kings ships called
the Trementany, sent out against them, over whom Captain Williams was
Captain, and for this disseigne had strengthened himself with some of Captain
Hews company, betwixt whom being a most corragious encounter, the Captains on
both sides bravely behaved themselves, the one fighting for honor and the other
for safety, but Captain Iennings finding himself the weaker, since his cause
was the worser, his ship being of swift speed and having wind as it appears,
could go off at his pleasure, fearing the danger, was glad by flight to be
freed of his foe: so that the shaking ague of this fear, ended the burning
fever rose in both the Captains minds, namely Captain Iennings and Captain
Roupe, and they vowed now whosoever they met though the ^oe had the odds, they
would dare him to fight, and so put on to the coast of Spain, where in their
sailing they met with two Spanish ships, made up to them, with all speed
possible, and being come each of the other, within reach of shot, either
without haling them, or commanding them to strike, the (...) news they heard
was abroad side, by which unwelcome messengers understanding at full, what
their neighbors were, and to what unjust coming their purpose was, being two
ships wa^likely appointed, and their enemy but one, they redied themselves for
a needful defense, so that betwixt them straight was a cruel fight* the
Spaniards not doubting in respect of their odds to go off with ease, and the
other resolving with the help of their resolutions to conquer at pleasure: for
the space of full four hours was this fight cruel, one fighting in hope of
spoil, and the other to save what their pains had got: sometimes victory
promising fairly to the one, to the disharting of the adverse, and anon
declining from them to look cheerfully on the other, to the discouraging of
the countrary.

But the valor of the Captains (though it was resolute and desperate) being
waid in scales of trial, it proved too light to counterpoise the just o^ence
and resistance of the Spaniards, so that ten or eleven of Captain Iennings
company in this rash enterprise being ^aine, himself hurt and twenty more of
the same confederacy dangerously, shot, their ship s^re beaten, and the sound
terrifide, with the best wings of have which their sails could fly withal,
they are glad now to be quit of those foes which even now they were so
headstrong to quarrel with, and the Spaniards on the other ^de, not scaping
so well they could boast of the day, any more but this, they were glad of
escape, by this they were both quit of the others company.

Which two disasters happening to them one in the neck of another, namely their
escape from Captain Williams, and their mischievous conflict in their attempt
against these two Spaniards, the whole company began to murmr against
Captain Iennings, gathered the voice thereof from thus ground, and was this
uttered, that no doubt their crosses past and dangers present, so many of
their consorts being sore hurt, and their ship so out of order, it was as a
just judgment of God against them, in suffering their Captain to bring his
whore aboard and there to wallow in his ^urucie, when counsel was to be held
for their future safety: others strengthening it with this, why should he have
his ^hore for himself any more then the rest? al co^demning the permissio^,
and exclayming against disorder, amongst whom there was no order, they
pretended straight to have a redress, Which being subtly understood by
Captain Rou^, he having men of his own to strengthen his part, and finding it
the fittest advantage for his advancement, he soothd them on to the action in
hand, and vrgd them with this, that success in their con^ition was never
found, when a woman was more Master of the Captain, then the Captain of his
men, that in all the purchase (though unlikely yet) they should ever take,
through the enticing flatteries, with which he seemed to be besotted and
bewitched, the maine profit thereof should redow^d to her, and they like
thrashers should labor and sweat to bring the sweet unto other men's mouths,
whereupon the strength of their spleenes being here encouraged, the heat of
their murmur grew up to muteny, and in a gi^y manner breaking into their
Captains cabin, whom they found set and embraced by his Irish Mistres, they
boldly began to reprove his course, condemn his undertakings, and exclaim
against his ^osenes; whose haughty spirit boiling to hear his condition
controld (especially in the ear of her he was now ioying with) by those whom
he held his command might check, with a trunch^on that lay nere to him he
struck ^ne of them on the head, cleares his cabin of the rest, and having
beaten them all to a bay, he calls thus to Captain Roupe: Captain Roupe will
you suffer me to be thus ^aunted and abused by the madness of rascals, whom a
spot of mischance does drive to despair? But he not hasty to succor his
expectation, hi^ company made good against him, and by their violence and
outrage compelled him to retire to the Eune-roome, where to avoid the he ^t of
their fury, manning the door, one of his company discharged a musket upon him,
but his life being reser^d to a future shame for his actions, it most
vnfortunably mist him, and the fire of their rage, being alla^d by the
persuasion of Captain Roup which in this heat would have consumed his life, it
was only agreed, and their tempest satisfied to have him discarded from his
Captaine-ship and confind from the pleasure and company of his wench, by being
detained in the gun-roome, over whom Captain Roup was made keeper, and
instituted also their Captain both of them and their ship: only here is to be
noted, in this ship there was great store of riches, and so they now put out to
the southward Cape.

In which time, Captain Iennings remaining prisoner with patience (since he
found resistance was bootlesse) he so insinuated with Captain Roup that he
brought Captain Roup to prevail with his men, that they gau^ their consents
for his liberty of the ship, and then again dealing privately with Lodge,
Williams and others, he had wrought them now to repent their rashness, and the
rather for that Gilbert Roup having the power in his command, he did not seem
so wholly to rely on the trust of them who had formerly ben of Captain Iennings
company, as he did on those had been of his own, neither in countenance and
outward show (seemed any way so kind and affable to them) being, indeed a man
of more stern and obdurate nature then Iennings was, which they disliking in
him in heart, but not daring to utter, his own affection being the stronger,
they were compelled to be content.

So that being now in the southward Cape, they happened upon a French pinck with
rich lading, against whose assailement the Frenchman making a forceable
resistance, they were at length come to grapple, when Captain Roup and his men
as well in the aim of credit to be seen forwarder then Iennings or his men,
h^pe of riches which they guest they had in chase, as also by the politic
persuasion and egging of them on by Captain Iennings, when they came to
boarding, Captain Roup and most or al of his company being ransacking the
pincke, Iennings tu^nd now to persuade his men thus: that the ship was his
own, and he had been their Captain, that much riches they had purchased
together, and he had given them their faithful shares, that occasion was now
offered to show their loves friends to him, that if any thing had been amiss,
his valor should redeem it, and his courtesy amend it, and that Captain
Roup made but instruments of them for his present use, who by his cruel and
stubborn nature, they might perceive he would requite with unthankfulness
and no doubt with their ruins, when advantage should further it.

With which pers^asion of his, he so forcibly prevailed, that they in an
instant called their Captain, and began to ready themselves, to resist
Captain Roup and his forces in the pincke when he should offer to come aboard
again, which he intending to do as also ^o freight their ship with most and
the best of the luggage they violently withstood him, nay told him further,
that if for their former labor, they might not freely share in the profit was
found, they were now to become as eager foes to him and his company as before
to the Frenchman.

When Captain Roup judging of the trick, an^ knowing his strength too weak
to disable them he thought it best to come to composition, and be glad of part,
least compelled by necessity he should loose all, so that a friendly agreement
is made between them: Captain Iennings is Captain of his own ship, Captain
Roup of the French pincke, all are friends and they put now for the coast of
Ireland.

When in the way, Captain Iennings having regaind his former riches, charge,
and a share in the spoil Roupe had taken from the Frenchman, he began now to
consider of the ^cklenes of his estate, the inconstancy of his men, and the
dangers that were instant to the course of his life, he desired now in heart he
might make his peace and procure the liberty of his country again, although
with the tender of all he had, to which purpose he intended to order his
actions, when safe occasion should suffer him, though concealing his intent to
himself, and so they put into Baltimor, which harbor lies in my Lord of
Cla^ricards country, and to whom he meant to submit himself, but by no means
(whether his men suspecting his intent or no I am unresolved) he could not be
suffered to go ashore, only four of his company being sent out with the
long-boate, namely Thomas Renolds, John Lodge, John Williams who was Botson of
the ship, and one James a ^renchman who was Trumpeter, to discry if the coast
were clear and their arrival might be in safety, who being landed resolved
with themselves, never to return to carry him news, but every one to make
shift for one, and so ashor^ to avoid suspicion they betook their course to
several ways, James the Trumpetter hyring an Irish kerne to b^ his guide, by
his conductor had his throat cut. Renolds was first taken, by a Captain of my
Lord of Clanricards, and brought before my Lord in his Castle, who confessing
how and with whom he came in, he was with a charge conueid to the Castle in
Dublin, but Lodge and Williams came not till a fortnight after.

But Iennings now seeing their return doubtful, began straight to suspect
himself, and put off again from Baltimor up to the river of Limbrincke, which
is my Lord of Toumonds country, yet desiring still to yield up himself, if
safely he might, where lying at anchor both with Captain Roupes ship and his
own, yet so far without reach of my Lord of Toumonds Castle, that he might go
off and come on at pleasure, he now in his long boat himself put on near the
shore, and caused a parle to be sommond to the Castle, of which sommons my
Lord understanding, he sent down to him one of his sons and diverse of his
men to know what they would? which being deconded, Iennings expressed to them
that he desired some conference with my Lord whom if it pleased his honor he
would attend in his own Castle, only that offering thus voluntary to put
himself (being in danger) into his Lordships hands, he would have a couple
left aboard his ship as hostage for his safe return, which understood at full
by my Lord, his request was granted, and Iennings was co^ducted up to the town
and two of my Lords chiefest men sent as pledges aboard, when y^ next morning
Iennings being brought in presence before my Lord, he presently related the
story of his life, and offered to submit himself, his whole co^pa ny, the
estate and purchase he had, under his Lordships protection, with condition,
this: his Lordship would be his mediator for the Kings majesty's mercy, and
procure his pardon, when his Lordship in wisdom finding it not requisite to
articulate with him further then he required, since two of his followers I and
kinsmen too were aboard his ship, and seeing both the ships as well his own as
Roupes, with their whole companye^ and fading, except himself, to lie so
aloo^e they might go off at pleasure in spite of control, he gravely
thought it fit to give this fish line till he might more justly choke him, with
the bait he coueted: and the reuppon gave him his protection for a named time,
for himself and his company, seemed ^o regard him with entire respect and
promised him withal, that so far as w^ his honnour he fastly might, he would
prove his honorable friend to procure his p^rdon, upon which hope, Iennings
emboldned, he rioted in pleasure and reuelled in the town, carried one of my
Lords sons and diverse gentlemen inhabiting there about, diverse times aboard
his ship, where his entertainment to them was wonderful, and presents given
unto every hand, showing them withal, his Lordships protection, and relating
the honorable promise his ears received from his own tongue, which was he
would do his best to procure his pardon, which enticing promise of my Lords,
though Iennings had heard it, and in regard of the protection, was brought to
believe, neither Roup nor the rest would be brought to trust, only now and
then some two or three by turns going a shore for fresh victual and so
returned again.

For the space of a fortnight they thus continued, in all which time by no
persuasion of Iennings, nor hope of my Lord could Roup or the ships be brought
within check, neither my Lords men who were left in hostage for Iennings be
delivered a shore. Till one day having feasted voluptuously with them aboard,
and drunk hard, he out of his own motion made the offer unto them, that that
night they should go with him and revel it a shore: from this he was
disuaded by some who at this instant were more staid then himself, but he
neglecting their council, the long boat is called for, they are set a shore and
reuelling it in Limbricke, and the next morning no doubt had returned again
had not this which follows happened that night.

Captain Roup having intelligence that my Lords men were gone with him to
land, coming aboard the ship, he contrived with the master, and into his long
boat conveyed out of the gun-port most of Iennings shot and powder, as with
purpose but to borrow it, and the next need to repay it again: with which
being stored he hoysed sails, and away goes he: and the Master of Iennings
ship in the morning missing the pinck, seeing neither Captain norpledges
returned aboard, doubting some treachery, he does the like, and my Lord of
Toumond taking note how the ships were gone, and that the limit of his
protection given, had expirde the date: he commands Iennings to more safe
custody, yet with express charge to be worthily used, and having by this space
directed his letters to Sir Robert Chichester Lord deputy of Ireland, of all
these proceedings, there is by this, a warrant come to my Lord Toumonds hands,
from the counsel of Ireland, to direct his prisoner to Dublin, who not only
graciously using of him while he was in his charge, but by express command,
resigning him over to those had order for his safe conduct, he gave him out of
his own coffers a hundred pownd starling, to defray his expense.

Being now come unto Dublin, and examied before the Council, he denied not
what he bad been, and pleaded for mercy since he came in voluntary, which by
this that follows may appear no doubt had been granted, had not his former
life been so contemptible: for during the time of his stay in Dublin which was
above three months, the right honorable Earl of Clanricard, and Lord Toumond
who in thatspace was present there, had so labord for him that he had all the
liberty of the country within ten mile about both to hawke and to hunt and
none to attend him but only on James a musition, who was my Lord of Clanricards
man provided this he returned to the castle for hislodging atnight.

Nay, after that, by the direction of the Council here, he was to be sent for
England: and that they had received true and perfect instructions what an ill
liver he had been, in that they would not seem to dishearten him in the
journey he was to take, they dischargd him of custody, and as it had been to
have imployd him in some affairs of import, gave him charge of a letter to the
Mayor of Chester, whose purpose was to convey him to London. From Chester he
was conducted to the Marshalseyses in Southwark, where remaining even since May
last, to the eye of men, he lived a careless life, or dreadles of that he did
think was to come: one being merry a drinking with him once, demanded of him
thus: faith Captain Iennings and how did you live when you were at Sea? how
(quoth he) I rejoiced more to hear the Cannons voice that bid me to fight,
then the Church-bell that called me to prayer: I fought not as chickens fight,
for their meat to sustain nature, but for store of gold, to maintain riot:
Another time being drinking in the parlor, where they use to dine in the
prison, it being somewhat before Bartholmewtide, in hot weather, he sat just
with his face in the sun, when one demanded of him, Captain Iennings why do
yor sit with your face in the Sun, it will make your head ache: fogh pox quoth
he what do you tell me of the head-ake, that shall hang in the sun shortly when
my neck shall ache, and I do but practice now how I shall fry then. The same day
that Captain Harris was brought into prison, being the satterday before the
arraignement, which was the monday following, he was in the Marshalseys yard,
throwing of snowbals, just as Captain Harris was coming in at the gate, who
having a snow-ball at that instant in his hand, ready to throw, one called unto
him aloud, Captain Iennings Captain Iennings, Captain Harris is coming,
Captain Harris quoth he, I love him well, but and the hangman himself were
coming I would throw out my throw first: these have I set down to signify to
the world the desperatenes of his course, the intemperance of his actions, and
the slight regard, he seemed outwardly to take of his soul, in that little
walk was given him to look upon, betwixt his life and death. The time of his
trial being come, he was the first that stood indicted and arraigned for those
several piraces before recited, and with these of his company, namely Thomas
Renolds shoemaker, John Williams Mariner and Botson of his ship, and John
Lodge, who being demanded what they could severally say to the indictment,
Captain Iennings began to intercept the clark, and in this manner to plead in
their excuse. Alas my Lord what would you have these poor men say? they can
say nothing to it, if any thing they have done they were compeld unto it by me,
and I must answer for it. To this excuse by that honorable court he was thus
answered, that they doubted not but his own conscience bore witness against
him, that he had heard enough in his several enditements, to answer for
himself, and so they wished him let every one of them, and if it should
appear either by testimony or circumstance, as heinfer^ they were clear, the
whole Court should be glad of it, and to that purpose they should be heard
themselves, or any for them at full. Whereupon Thomas Renolds, by the name of
Thomas Renolds shoemaker, was again called, and demanded of the Clarke of the
Admiralty, what he pleaded to the enditement, whether guilty or not guilty? who
answering not guilty, and desierd of their Lordships, he might with their
gracious favor be heard, and which being by the honorable of the counsel
upon his request presently granted, he pleaded thus, That at the time of
Captain Iennings anchoring in Baltimor, he was a Iourniman shoemaker resident
in Corcke, whom Captain Iennings sent for, (as he might have done for any
other) to bring boots or shoes to furnish both himself and his whole
company, who with a couple of boys in hope to make a way his masters ware
with profit, came aboard his ship, and fitted them also far as his ware would
serve, for which, according to his own price, he was from Captain Iennings
own hand orderly paid, and he delivered the money to one of the boys to carry,
and sent them to stay for him some respite a shore, while he being enticed by
the Captain and others to rest a while and be merry with them, was with the
ouercharging of many made so drunk that he fell in a sleep, in which time the
wind serving, and they having compassed themselves of all things fit, the
first time he waked he found himself at Sea, and the Captain and others in
fight with one of those ships, for which he stood now indicted, and for proof
hereof he brought in another shoemaker, to iuis^fie that at the same time he
then inferd, he was working in Cork, and lived honestly by his labor so that
if any thing he had done, it was done in the company of them by whom he was
compeld unto it, and therefore quoth he, I humbly desire both your honors and
the Jury, to mingle mercy with justice, conscience with equity, and so
commisserate my case. Which tale of his having so good a relish of credit, he
being the first that expressed the form, though many after (both of Captain
Iennings, Captain Harris, and Captain Longcastle^ companies) endeavored to
follow the course, their honors leaving his defense to the good consideration
of the Jury to determine how true it was, he only by their verdit was returned
not guilty, and the rest (with their Captain) convicted as fellones and
pirates upon the high seas, and in manner and form as they stood invited. And
after their conviction and judgment they were conveyed back to the
Marshalseys, from thence on Friday morning to Wapping, the place appointed for
their execution: where Captain Iennings being the first that was called to go
up to his death, and seeing that he had been all this while deluded with a
fruitles hope (for upon my knowledge both Captain Harris and he the day before
their execution, did report they were repreiued) he did now in soul repent him
of his sin, complained of his lusts and ryots, as the causers of his ruin,
confessed that before this he had received pardon for his heinous transgressions,
and had not the goodness to desist from ill: he desired God of his mercy to
receive his soul, and the world at his death to pardon his body, and so
desiring the multitude of spectators to pray for him and sing a psalm with
him, he was the first was turned of the ladder, and after him both Lodge and
Williams, as his consorts and confederates found guilty in his actions, did
likewise suffer death.

The discourse of Captain Longcastle alias Lancaster, and them of his company
that sufferd, namely William Tauerner and John Moore.
THis William Longcastle was directly known, and so accused by one of the
right honorable of the Counsel, at the time of his trial, to be an
arch-pyrate, and formerly a confederate with that famous Ward, although both
himself, Tauerner and the other did stiffly deny to stand guilty according to
their indictment, or to deserve whereby to be accused for robbing the Susan of
Bristoll, of whom one Anthony Wye was Master, which piracy was thus committed.

One master Hal a credible merchant of this honorable City, furnishing forth
a ship of his called the Ulysses of London, for the west Indies, and
instituting in this his venture (which amounted to a thousand pound) one of his
men as governor and factor thereof, she from the river of Thames, puts out to
sea, where meeting with several disasters, both to her self and her men, in
the many alterations incident on the waters, the Factor thought it fit (having
by the merchants appointment the whole order and trust) to put in about
Plymouth, to strengthen and repair their former mishaps, when inquiring for
Mariners that were best and ablest to venture themselves in so long a voyage,
and furnishing their wants with all that before their necessity asked, he came
acquainted, and did take into his company and aid, these three by the names of
Longcastle, Tauerner and Moore, and with these he puts on to Sea, in hope of
success, where anchoring to take in fresh water at Sophy in Barbary, they met
with y^ Susan of Bristoll, over whom was master, Anthony Wye, of the same
City: between whom, being both travelers from one nation, there was
friendship and congratulations enterchangeably offered (between these two
houses and householders) on the waters, as formally as then they had met
ashore: as, one day the Susan to feast the Ulysses, and the next day the Susans
men to come aboard of her, which occasion now this Captain Longcastle not
loosing the advantage of, he practiced privately with this Tauerner and Moore,
for the surprisall of the Susan, and to the furthering and finishing of this
unjust enterprise, he wrought with Master Hals Factor, to inuit the Master
Anthony Wye, with as many of the others as he gotinstructions had command in
the Susan, to come to banquet and revel aboard their Ulysses, of which
courtesy offered, Master Wye having no occasion to conceive any suspicion, of
any mischief invented, since they had formerly enterchangeably dealt in the
same courtesies, and espetially lying both at refuge now in Sophie road, and so
near upon the shore, their desire is condiscended unto, and he with his agents
in the long boat belonging to the Ulysses, is brought a board, their feast is
furnished, their entertainment welcome, and the healths go round, when these
three, eying their opportunity, in the edge of their entering, they slip away by
turns, and with some other whom they had won to be linked as their consorts,
they privately man out the long boat, and coming near the Susan, making their
pretense to bring back their master, and the rest of their friends, they
presently board her, clap her men under hold, and ceeze on her goods, hoyse
sails, and by the help of this stratagem, in this ship of Bristoll, they are
out at Sea, which Master Wye having notice of, and judging by their flight of
the innocence of the Factor, the Ulysses makes on for her West-Indian voyage,
the Master Anthony Wye is left at Sophie, and after as conuenience would
afford him, makes his return to England, where complaining to the high Court
ofadmiralty of this outrage offered, it was needful and just for him, in his
own discharge, to g^ue in the names of these three as actors of this pyracy,
till time should give means for their apprehension and answer.

But see how if happened, there was with Captain Longcastle in this ship of
the Ulysses a Negro, who not a month before, he had bought to be his boy and
brought to be a Christian, who in the rashness to surprise and have to get
off, he had neglected to take with him him left, in the Ulysses, whereby the
Factor was constrained to take him along with him, and at his return delivered
him to master Hall at London, unto whom also (urging his own innocence) he
related the mischance had happened, disco^sed the manner, and to his master
(as it is here recorded) delivered their names, who for his own discharge, and
the discharge both of his ship and goods, he delivered so much to the Lord high
Admiral, and so his factor as the season served with the like trust is sent to
sea again: in whose absence, this Captain Longcastle having his name infamous
for a Roner, noterious for a Pirate, and known for certain to be a confederat
with Ward, he belike not doubting so much of himself as was here manifest, he
puts secretly in at Causon bay near Plimmoth, and with this Tauerner and
Moore, thought to live privately, till they could fully compound with this
Anthony Wye, for his injury past, being certain no other Englishman could
witness against them. And this is a thing worthy note amongst these pirates,
they never see or know of their adversary, but they are as perfect as
himself, for how much they must compound, which may seem strange to some,
since amongst thieves it is unlikely there should be any order but all hauock,
and catch that catch may to be all their stake. But with these sort of robbers
it is not so, for being once sure the burden is their own, the Captain calls
straight for the master or merchant, and demaundes forthwith for their bills
of lading, whereby he knows what belongs to the merchant, and what to the
mariners, when the merchants venture is always taken for lawful prize, but
the sailors goods is most commonly restord, and this bill does the pirate
Captains most carefully keep and lay up, and as they call it, for their own
discharge.

But to our purpose, this Long castle living thus lurking to and fro about
Cornwall, the infamy of his name brought him in more suspicion then any ready
accusstion that was extant against him: so that this report of him being
carried about by rumoring tongues, and buzd abroad in somany ears it was at
last brought to a right worshipful Knight and a Justice of peace, who calling
him before him, he demanded from him of his course of life, and as how and
where for the last three years he had orderly spent his time? who being able
to render no confident and resolving answer, he thought it good in his
discretion to commit him to prison, yet pretending no further, but till he
could put in sufficient sureties for his good behavior: when in the mean time
this provident Gentleman, sent first to the Uiceadmirall to enquire against his
name, and after to the high Court of admiralty, if nothing were inferd against
him, when after search it appeared upon record the former piracy against the
Susan of Bristoll, and the master thereof Anthony Wye, and his deposition
against Longcastle and Moore to the same purpose, whereupon they were all
three, committed to Exceter Jail, in the County of Devonshire: and against
their time of trial, as the other removed to the Marchalseys, and at their
day of arraignement according to Justice stood indicted for the same offense,
unto which invitement they pleaded not guilty, whereupon Anthony Wye by name of
Anthony Wye of Bristoll mariner and master of the Susan, was in person called
to give in evidence against them, who being seen the day before in Court, and
not now making his personal appearance to justify according to his eath, it
was then demanded of Longcastle (the Court having notice of as much) if that
during the time of his late imprisonment in the Marchalsies, he at no time had
conference with the said master? he denied not but he had, as also if that
neither himself nor any other for him* had privately dealt to give any secret
composition with the said Wye, to neglect his appearance, and so to hinder the
just and lawful proceedings against his life? which he thus answered: for
mine own part (quoth he) I never offered him penny for the saue-guard of my
self or any of my company, neither had he any reason for it, since they were
not the men that were then at the fact: yet he had heard that some friend of
his in his behalf, had offered him in full satisfaction, restitution to the
valor of all his goods lost, as also in gratuity to himself fifty pound, in
consideration he would be silent* it was then demannded of him who that friend
should be? he answered he knew not, whereupon by one of the Council it was
urged, how unlikely it was that any man should offer a composition for him of
so much money, and he be a stranger to the motion: besides what reason had any
friend to make such an offer if his friend were clear since the law is so
just in every man's case, nay when the Kings majesty himself in the care of
his subjects, sends both his Council of state and Council at law to sit even
as vmpires between Justice and their lives. Whereupon master Hall was
called, to certify whether his man at his return, had not given in to him the
perfect names of those three men as they stood there indicted, and the true
description of their statures, who answered the names and statures of three
such men his man had given him, but whither they were the men, he neither durst
nor could not say, for he had never seen them (and his man was now at sea)
till they were now arraigned: in which doubt they called earnestly upon the
Court, Anthony Wye being absent M. Halls factor at sea, and none as yet
personnally to give evidence against them, that their Lordships would be
merciful unto them, and not to cast away their innocent lives upon mere
presumptions, that no other evidence as yet coming in, it was thought of the
spectators and all (but the Court who knew there the men) they should then have
been quitte: when straight was called the Negro who before had been his man and
reserved in piruate to se how long their impudence would hold out, when first
being demanded if Longcastle had been his master, he answered yes: then was
asked of Longcastle if the Moore had been his boy, who resolved that he had:
the boy was then questioned, if he was not at sea with him in the Ulysses? the
boy affirmed it, and Longcastle being demanded the same question, although he
staggerd at the first, could not strongly deny it. Upon which affirmation, the
evidence being strong against Longcastle, it was pleaded by the other, and
especially by Tauerner that they were not the men who were then at the action:
and whereas there was no more but the direct title of their names against them,
there was no doubt many more of the same name, of Tauerner and Moore in this
spacious Kingdom besides themselves: to the resolving of which doubt, then
Moore was called again and demannded by the Court whether they three namely
William Longcastle, William Tauerner, and John Moore, were not the men each in
particular Master Hals factor took in for the better furnishing his ship and
performance of his voyage at P^imoth? he answered they were: whether they
three were not the three men feasted with Anthony Wye in y^ road of Sophy in
Barba rye in the company of the aforesaid factor in y^ said ship of the
Ulysses? he answered they were, and whether the said Longcastle, Tauerner and
Moore, leaving their promised voyage in the aid of the Ulysses of London, did
not according to their former practice, offer their ontrage against the Susan
of Bristoll in manner and form as they stood invited? when he affirmed
directly they were the men.

Upon which, Longcastle desirde of their Lordships to be heard, and inferd that
he denied him not to be his boy, but entreated of the Court, that the tongue of
a Pagan, an Infidel, whose testimonies were no evidence to confirm the Jury,
and whose words were to be held in no regard, might not be the are to hew down
the tree of his life, but if that his transpressions against the law had
deserved death, I beseech your Lordships quoth he, let the tongue of a
christian and not of a Pagan cut off my life.

Which words appeared unto all ears that were present, to be uttered from the
vch^ncy of his soul, and from the Court he was thus resolved. That where he
desired to have the oath of a Christian, himself, and the Moore had confessed he
had made him one, which was the most vertuo^ and blessedst deed that he did
show in his whole life: but then Lordships told him withal they must give
him to understand, that it was not the approouement of his tongue, nor that he
had b^ne his boy which made them give credit, that now they stood guilty, but
the resolved oath of Anthony Wye, whose ship they robbed and whose goods they
ransackt, who had seen them, spoke with them, swor^ against them, I and
themselves had labourd to compound withal (and won to keep out of the Court
for the injury they had done him) whereby it appeared and so now they must
satis^e the Jury, no sun can shine clearer to show us a moate, then this
eui^ent testimony to witness their blemish: besides, that from the time of
their imprisonment in Exeter Jail, till this hour of their arraignment, not
one of them all that can well bring in a credible certificat how well or ill
they have spent their times, upon which instructions given to the Iur^, and
the s^ale so put into their hands, to weigh y^ condition of their lives the
Iurywent forth and staid not long ere they brought the^ in guilty, at which
sentence against them, Longcastle and Moore spoke never a word, but Tauerner
whether he thought he could out face the cause, or y^ he feared death more then
the rest, for my part I will not judge, but he grew vehement, and called for a
book to swear in his innocence, although I was credibly certified both his
Captain and himself did after in the prison with these words confess, that
we are heartily sorry we shall be hanged now for a petty action, that have
merited talk in matters of worth. So having their sentence, they were conveyed
back to the Marshalsies, where I must credibly speak of them, they behaved
their lives so carefully for the future comfort of their souls, as if they had
never been the men, the whole course of whose actions, had been addicted to
such an ungodly purposes, making their way to the gate of salvation, by
confessing their sins, and knocking thereat for entrance, with sorrowful
sighs, and repenting hearts, which no doubt flewe open unto them: they were
three men who were never seen to laugh from the sentence of death to the power
of execution thereof: they desired not the company of their friends* but made
prayers their acquaintance, they lamented now that (in hope to gain a little
breath which they must be sure to loose) they had slandered and belyed their
consciences in denying their crimes, they freely commended their transgressions
to the law that was ordaind to punish them, they willingly resignd their
bodies to the earth, the mother of mankind, and made for their grave, and most
religiously gave up their souls unto Heaven from whence it was given them: and
so from creatures of wickedness having created themselves Angels of goodness,
from practisers of folly, proved counselors to faith, and so from the sea of
mischief, through which their whol^ pilgrimage had travailed, making their
bodies the fit sepulcher of repentance, from the Marshalseys as the rest, they
were conueid in a barge to Wapping the silver ore borne before them as an
emblem before their eyes, that riches they looked for, and unjustly sought to
find it at Sea, where the Captain first, and the other two after (as they
confessed they had deserved) according to Judgment they suffered death.

The discourse of Minas.
THis William Minas was a Mariner, married and had his abiding in Cornwall,
who not contented with that sufficient means that God and nature had provided
for him, being (as so was most of them all) a man of comely personage, and of
an able body, by unjust courses thought to strengthen his fortune, so that
using means to get to sea in a pretty ship, called the Concord of Plymouth,
upon the coast of France he met with a Frenchman, and as the custom of
Pirates is, being the stronger party, without asking her leave, he ransacked
her goods: but as it is certain, he that once endeavors to begin to steal,
does straight endeavor and learn to lie, since lying and stealing are as
inseparable companions as a thief and receiver, so that Minas had a colorable
tale at the time of his araignment, bearing some likelihood of truth to excuse
his theft. Namely that making home from Spain to his abiding in Cornwall, his
ship (the Concord) beaten with weather, began to sail and put himself and men
in distress, near the ^ast of France, where he met with this Frenchman, so
that he having far to sail, and the Frenchman near his arrival, he
compounded and gave him satisfaction to exchange ships with him, and so
dismissed his lading from his to the Frenchmans, and the Frenchmans to his,
promising withal, with this condition, that the Frenchman should receive his
ship here in England, but named no place: they thus agreed the Frenchman
departs for France, and Minas he privately in the night puts into his abiding
in Cornewal, presently absents himself for three quarters of a year, gives
order to his wife under that cu^ur to labor his protection with the
viceadmirall, and leaves the ship without guide or owner, as a derelict due to
the Lord Admiral, at A^izor in the bay. The Frenchman now having been robbed of
his ship and goods, and knew by an Englishman, comes and expresses his injury
to the high court of admiralty, and there directly deposes, that he was robbed,
never inquiring for his ship nor feeding himself with hope that ere he should
hear of her till at last welcome tidings is brought where his ship anchors,
and as a derelict she was ceazed to the Lord Admirals use, unto whose honor by
petition complaining of his wrong, and proouing the godds to be his, his
Lordship gives order she is straight restord him, and warrants are directedout
for the apprehension of Minas, which he having intelligence of, lurking close
or not daring yet to be seen abroad, he uses an inward mean by agreement to
stop the Frenchmans complaint: the Frenchman on the other side, knowing he had
lost his goods, and considering belike, that his life might make him some
satisfaction, but no restitution, consents to the composition, take ^his money,
Nay, is content (in regard he was bound to it) to go to the Uiceadmirall, or
Court of admiralty, and there to unsay what before he had justified, that is to
say, that his ship was lent and not stolen, which being done, Minas appears,
not like an owl that's seen but in the night, but like a bisd that flutters by
day, revels it gallantly and securely, and thinks now in his heart that all is
safe.

But he that has commission under the Lord Admiral for the discovering and
routingout of such infectious members, and the law most carefully on the other
side, not suffering such offenders to ^ubberouer their iniquities, to the
encouraging of others, and hartning them to these co^ses, brings me this Pyrate
to apprehention, from apprehention to arraignement, where his own confession
and the former circumstances duly examined, it was made evident by the Court
to the Jury, how evident this pack and close far^le of knavery, was ripped up:
whereupon according to the Indictment, he was brought in by verdit guilty, and
accordingly received sentence, from the Marshalseis he was conueid to Wapping,
where repenting him of his sins, he confessed the fact, only labourd to acquit
the reputation of a worshipful Gentleman, that stood tainted in suspicion to
have contrived and dealt with him in concealing this pyracy, and so yielded
himself to death.

Of Thomas.
NOt to lengthen out paper with this poor fellow, of more then appeared either
by his confession, arraignment or execution, it is only thus, he was
apprehended upon suspicion, making sail of some goods, and being strictly
examined, he presently confessed what he had done, whom he had robbed, and in
whose company: namely in the company of one Lawding Barry, that is a pyrate
new, and was set on shore in Ireland: upon which confession being arraignd, and
condemned he amongst the other suffered death.

Thus Reader have I truly brought to thine eyes, the discourse of Captain
Ieames Harris, under his own hand, the course of his life which men should be
sorry for, and the goodness of his death, who (though enforced to be untimely)
yet men should rejoice in it: eight of his company with those that suffered
with him, namely Peter Brush Fisherman and Master of his ship, John Spencer
and Thomas Spencer brothers, at whose death it drew pity in all the beholders,
for the elder suffering first, and then the younger turned off, he hung beating
his hands on his brothers breast: be sides these was Samuel Read, Richard
Baker, Ierom Lockey, Ieames Smith, and Roger Notting, yet these, though they be
first placed, they were of seauenteens the last that finished the act of the
tragedy: to make woeful the rest of the scene, was Captain Iennings, John
Lodge and John Williams of his company, and to make doleful the whole project,
was Captain William Longcastle, William Tauerner, and John More of his
company, and betwixt whom as miserable Chori, comes in Thomas (...) Minas, to
divide the act: these seauenteene on Friday in the forenoone, made their last
testament, so that of nineteen that were condemned in this great sessions of
Pirates, before as honnorable a bench, and as fair and orderly proceedings, as
in such cases man's memory can witness: two only from that present execution,
who for part of that following day, reioycingly gladded themselves with hope of
continuing life: namely, Captain Downs and Captain Halse, but their peace
being cro^ by the Kings majesty and the counsel, more at large understanding
and considering of the cruelty and heynousnes of their several offenses,
between four and five a clock in the afternoon, almost at high water, they
were also executed: of whose lives and deaths reader, if thou be pleased
with the former, and desire to be satisfied of the rest, to give thee
content, I have writ as follows.

The discourse of Captain Downs.
THis Downs had sometimes lived a hopeful merchant in a place called Langraue
near Colchester in the county of Essex, till his superfluous expense and
retchles life made him crack his credit amongst men ofworth and those he had
trading with, his word was esteemed as sufficient as his bond, and his seal
would have been acceptably received for larg^ sommes, till neglecting his
trafick and following the sensualleties of his pleasures, he had so far
disparaged both, that having brought himself behind hand, and in danger to
those, had put him in trust, that for fear of imprisonment he durst not be
seen, he resolved upon these unjust courses of piracy: he was a fellow but
wearish and simple in show, but more violent, cruel and merciles, then any of
the rest: when he was at sea he considered not what belonged to the actions he
undertook, but resolved, that the finishing of whatsoever he pretended was
well, so it were don: in which resolution furnishing himself to wrong, as by
his own confession it appeared both at his araignment, and was read against
him upon record, namely that about midsomer last was three years he came into
Foy, in Cornwall, in a Portugal Caruil, laden with Sugers, Wines, and other
commodities, which he and his company took about the Madera^s: and as he
inferred by virtue and strength of a commission granted from the states of the
Low Countries, and the Captain of the ship, being one Albret Albertson of
Ankmers in Holland, and which prize they had lawfully took, and sold the most
part of the purchase thereof in Foy, either by general or particular sale, to
whomesoeuer would bye it.

Upon which coulourable excuse, though there were more then this indictment
against him, and he manifested to the honorable of the Court to be a known
offender, it was yet asked of him, where that commission was to bear testimony
in his innosence? which he not being able to show, it was by the Court told him
it was no maruail that he could not, since upon their knowledge, about the time
he related there was a strict prohibition by Proclamation for any English to
combine with the hollanders in any such attempts, so that he being driven to
silence in that behalf, and his excuse confuted with apparent truth, it was
yet demanded of him who and what they were, that were then in his company
besides the Captain, Albert Albretson, at the time of this pyracy? to which
article he answered there was one John Giles, master Richard Ward and P^hlip
Downs saylors, Water Cox, Hercules Kellam and one Robert Gilly of Perin, but
the rest of there names, being most of them Dutchmen, he could not remember, if
these then (answered the court) wear in thy company and as thou say the
outrage committed was don by commission from the states: to purge thy self and
that it may appear though here thou standst accused thou art yet both a good
servant to God and a faithful subject to thy King, deliver then where thou
partedst company with them, when thou l^ftest them, and how in thine own
behalf they may be heard of, the which without halting it appearing to the
Court he was not able to do, his own examination taken before the right
worshipful S. Daniell Don Judge, and others of the high Court of Admiraltie,
unto which he had set his hand, was directly read against him, the purpose
whereof appeared as it follows.

That the sixth of October was twelve months, or there abouts, he shipped
himself at Plymouth, with one Captain Brown in a small bark of some
sixteen tons, bound for Ginny as the company told him, being manned with
fifteen men all English, which Brown and himself near Silly met with
Captain Tomkins, in whose company shipping themselves they plied for Seuerne,
but in their course they were forced ashore near Swansey in Wales, where some
suspicion rising against them, through their misordered life, the whole company
being a land, from the Pincke. and Tomkins, one Garret and himself, more bold
to put themselves in hazard then the rest, they were apprehended by Lewis
Mansell and by him committed to the common Jail at Cardiffe, where after
instructions taken how they had lived, they were from Constable to Constable,
directed toward London, and were forward on their way so far as Reading, at
a village near the which, lodging all night, and the Constable not
understanding what a charge he had in hand, leaving but a slight guard to
attend them, the next morning before day, they brake out of the house* and from
them who had them in charge, and so escaped for London.

As also being demanded what riches they had, where they forsook the Pincke,
he confessed he had in his pur^e, twenty barbery ducats of gold, the which one
Roger Place of Cambridge had from him, and two little wedges of gold worth
forty ducats: that he had a cha^e and a Jewel, and 80. pieces of Barbery ^d*
the which one Dau^ had from him upon somecomposition between them and which
Dauis is perfectly known to Sir Robert Mansel: that one Griffin Bayliffe,
likewise had from Tomkins, three small g^ds of gold and certain Barbery
ducats but all according to his judgment not amounting to the value of above
twenty pound, and that this with some few yards of spanish cloth, was all the
riches he had at his first apprehention: being then demanded of whom, and by
what means, directly or indirectly he came by that gold and cloth by him
confessed, to be held in his custody? he answered, it was most part given him
in regard of their long acquaintance and friendship together by Captain
Tomkins and the rest, from some of his company he won at dice: being then
questiond, if in Tomkins company or in any ship of his own he had never been
unjustly at the ^a^sacking of any Merchant at sea? unto the which he pleaded he
had never, but as he formerly confessed in the Spanish Caruill, and in the
company of Albert Albr^son, which Caruill they brought into Foy, and new built
her there, made her a cross sail, and there lay at anchor five weeks, from
whence with the said duch man going to sea again they met with a fleet of
Hollanders of twenty eight sail, who took him prisoner with the whole company
co^uayed them to Amsterdam where after three weeks imprisonment, ^their
integrity understood of, they were without further charge discharged by the
States.

Unto which examination of his standing stiffely and appro^ing* hi^ innocence,
It was then demanded of him if be had never heard of a scotch ship, called the
Royal of Lesth? at the very name of which he was presently astonished, for he
did expect and was confident, that although his own conscience bare record
against him, for many offenses committed in that case, yet hoping that the
testimony of that Pyracy would not be brought in against him, he doubted not
but for want of evident witness to acquit himself of all the rest.

Yet to the demand replying with a a faint answer, he said, he had never
known of any such ship, neither as was suggested against him, had he ever been
Captain in a man of war at sea: upon which answer, by the name of John
Downs of Longraue, in the county of Essex, merchant, he was the second time
endited for apyracye, committed on the high seas, upon a Scottish ship of
Leeth, called the Royal, and the lading in the same, unto which inditenient, he
pleaded not guilty, whereupon was called to give evidence against him, John
Shipman of the City of Bristoll Merchant, and being swore to give true and
perfect testimony against the prisoner at the bar, concerning the pyracy and
spoil aforesaid, and the manner and form thereof, the purpose and evidence was
expressed as follows.

The evidence that was given a against Captain Downs.
THat acording to the charge of his oath, himself and his brother Thomas
Shipman being at Portugal, about the end of May last was twelve months did
there hyer and fraught the said ship, the Royal of Leeth, of one John
Matherson, master thereof, to transport and bring from thence such traffic
and commodities, as they had there ready to lade for Bristoll: upon which
agreement made and confirmed betwixt the master and them, himself and his
brother did then lade on board the said Royal, fifty tons of salt, and above
a hundred pound of Royalls of plate, being in six bags of pepper, one pack of
Calecutes, two hundredth weight of Tobacco, five hundredth weight of cordage, for
the account of themse^ues and their partners.

With which ship and goods making for Bristoll, betwixt Padslow and S. Iues,
upon the coast of Cornewnll, on Thursday being the 28. of April, 1608. early
in the morning they espied a sail a head, who shortly came up to them; haled
them and demanded of whence they and their ship was? who presently resolved
them they were of Bristol, and were thither bound: and then on the other side
questioned them accordingly, of whence they were? who auswered them they were
of the sea, and thereupon stearnely commanded the master to strike his top
sails, who resolved them he would not: whereupon some small fight being
entertaind between them, the Royal being to weak for the man of war, both
in men and munition, they presently laid their vessel aboard, and many of them
to the number of ten entered her hold, and there took out this John Shipman,
his brother Thomas Shipman, the scotch master John Mathewson, and the whole
company, except two or three boys, and put them in the Cockboat: so leaving
them to the mercy of the merciless winds and waters, to be driuenso ashore,
from which it was 7. or 8. leagues at the least, ^d when doubtless they had all
perished, the Cock being so ouerladen, had it not pleased God even when they
were almost driven out of sight of the^ that Captain Downs and his company,
suspecting belike and as it after appeared, that they in this wretchedness, on
the sudden dismissed had carried their money with the^, they in that opinion set
sail with all the speed that might be, and fetched up the co^kboat again, and
took them into their ship, first threatened them, then stripped them, and
searched them for their money, but finding none, the Captain commanded them
to be stowed in the hold, and there kept them in terrible fears for the space
of 12. hours; in which respit they took two of the ship boys hung them up
and whipped them with whips, still demanding of them betwixteuery lash, what
money they knew or had beard the master or merchant had in the ship, and where
it was lodged? who poor souls willing to hold out (til (...) ^mitie co^peld
the contrary) for their masters (...), they walled them about the heads with
small ropes, wrinching their foreheads and temples with such cruel torture, It
would have made a sauadge ryrant even in pity have wept, to have heard them
cry and lament, so that the vtmostwhich they did know, and morethen ever they
had heard of, in hope to gain some respit of ease, they were forced to
confess.

Then took they this John Shipman himself, and bound him to the foremast, and
beat him with a (...), the wretched man cried, and his brother lam^ed to hear
him: he begd for pity, but they were flinty hearted: and though that he had
told them the truth of all they had, they esteemed it for falsehood, and
commanded straight he should be hanged up by the neck, whose will like a
cruel thief was straight obeyed, and poor Shipman cut down again ere he was
a quarter dead, and there left either to recover by the merciful hand of God,
or there to perrish by the unjust hands of ^leines: while they not fully
satisfied with what he liad confessed and they partly had found, they fell to
ransacking a fresh, and took this John Shipmans chest and his brothers, and
took out from his own chest five rugs and two suites of apparel, and three
rings, wherein were set two fine diamonds, two suits of clothes, and a pair of
corrall bracelets: out from his brothers, together with a whole chest of
apparel, some diamonds, Tobacco, and other things belonging to one M. Anthony
Wye, worth a hundred Marks: and so rifling them of all their goods and
commodities but their salt, they delivered them back again their ship and
departed in the evening.

Being then demanded whether John Downs were Captain, and did appear unto
them to have the chief command of that man of war which took them, as also
what manner of vessel she was, and of what burt hen?

To which article he answered, that the said John Downs arraigned and
indicted, was Captain and express commander in that man of war the which
surprised them, and that their ship was a bark of Perin, of 25. tons or
thereabouts, which belonged to John Bates of Perin, and now one of these
Pirates, as also that of his assisting company, was Thomas Martin of Salcous,
Peter Newman of Lalant, William Hatch of Foy, Fletcher of Perin, Richard Nowell
of Pensance, Thomas Lamlet of Cargraue near Salth^sh. John Trayes of Minifer
In Cornwall, John Matthew, Edward Higgins of Colbrooke, John Clarke of London,
John Barber of Dartmouth, one Garret of Dublin, and two or three others, whose
names he knows not: farther, that coming home with his ship to Bristol, and
being so certain of these men both by their names and countenances, his
brother and himself were both eager in their pursuit, not so much he protested
in desire of their bloods, as to have some satisfaction for the goods they had
rob bed from them of other men's, and was put in their trust, though not caring
for their own: in which dilligentinquest, it was the fortu^e of this
examinates brother Thomas Shipman, to happen upon this Captain Downs, and
caused him to apprehended in Wales, from whence he was sent toward London, but
by the way making an escape, which caused their pursuit to be fresh against him
they were the means that after he was arrested in Cornwall, committed
prisoner by one Master Resworricke, this is the man, and all this is the man,
and this is the perfect truth by the oath he has taken.

Unto all which he neither having power to deny, nor excuse so shameful a
truth, but by his filence to the evidence approved his guilt, he as the former
was by verdit convicted: and though by labor of his father, and the assistance
of some friends, and in especially of such whom he had formerly wronged, in
hope to draw some satisfaction from him, he was repreeued that morning when the
other seauenteene were executed: but his gracious majesty having from his
prudent and grave counsel, had understanding of the just proceedings, and the
ouerlooking of the in^ements, evidence and examinations of them all and finding
his actions more hateful then any of the rest in the morning had suffered,
express charge was sent for his present execution, while he stood imboldened
with hope of life, as one unworthy to live or have taste of any fanour, when
other of more merit, partly for the like, yet not for so grievous offenses had
suffered death, So that at four of the clock in the afternoon, he was
conveyed from the Marshaiseys to Wapping, where as strange was his life, so
stubborn was he at his end, scarce making any outward show or appearance of a
mortified man: heaven grant that he made him more rectified within: since not
two hours before his execution, he was heard boastingly to report of the worth
of his robberies, as if there had been credit in doing ill, namely how many
several pyracies he and his company committed in the habit of maskers, with
visards on their faces, and without speaking a word, making cruelty the organ
to utter their minds, whereby neither their names nor their favors were to
that day known to the iniurd Merchants, notwithstanding they had severally and
many times robbed those who had formerly known him: of whose end, wishing others
to be forewarnd by him, he desperately dyed.

The discourse of Captain Half.
THis Captain Half was a Gentleman of good descent, of mi^de behavior fair
of speech, and ^teous of conditions, yet to approve that the devil sometimes
has his working in the most gracious subjects, it shall appeace in this was
confessed by himself. Being resident (quoth he) about Cornwall, not thinking
so ill as these bad intents. I met with one Read an expert Gunner, and who had
formerly been of my ancient acquaintance, when after some familiarity passed
betwixt us, finding me belike a fit subject to be wrought upon for his purpose,
he persuaded me down to Casen Bay, where he brought me^ acquainted with
Captain Sacall, with whose delightful discourse of the life at Sea, his
itching pronuses of the raising of my fortunes, and the aspect of the riches
which he gave ^e to behold, I was so alterd from what I had been, so coynd to a
new disposition, and so bewitched with his inticements that my heart had
consented to be one of their crew, ere he had fully persuaded me, or my tongue
could utter my voluntary and free resolution: for which forwardnes of mine, in
a neat ship be readily had called the Jacob, by the persuasion of the Gunner,
and some liking it seemed he took toward me himself, he made me Captain and
to Sea we are bound, where near the straights, we met with a welthy prize,
entertaind a long and cruel fight with her, the victory yielding to neither
part, till most of the men on the adverse part were either slain or hurt,
whereby at length, our pursuit being eager, and their necessity prevailing with
them, they were at length compeld to yield, of whose goods we having made
saleof to our best advantage, when we came to parting every single share, the
worst and meanest in the ship came to forty pound, wherein I must needs say
Captain Sacall made it a conscience to give every one his due, rather with the
most to a pound then to deduct a penny from any: of this prize Captain Sacall
had for his share three thousand pound and I had fifteen hundred, with which
purchase and profit ^o highly encouraged, I continued for the most p^rt
spending it as loosely ashore, as it was gaind ^autly at Sea, approouing it to
be true, that goods got by the Devil, are most commonly spent upon his dam: or
as we use to say in English, b^ly gaind and worse spent: for whores do infecte
the soul with more leprosy and lothed spots then the body: in whose company I
was taught to make my actions to be reasonable, the which I now approve to be
frantic rashness, where my will learnt to have power above my understanding, by
whom wearing the sight that Lust had given me, I accounted yt beaco^s of
strumpets eyes (who never blaze but they betoken il) the ^dstone of my life and
the seamarkes of my safety, by whom being guided as the marks of falce
knowledge, I am now run on the rocks of destruction, whose allurements are
worse the spiders cobwebs for they wear their fatal weapons, not to catch
birds but flies but these make their ^nchantments so strong, that neither miad
wife, husband youth nor age, whosoever they happen on, but if they will attend
theft Sirens notes, ware is not sooner melted by the fierce fire, then they
wasted by the flame of them: husbands neglect their wives, wives loath their
children, youth their profit, age their health^ and in the wasting of all this,
they are accompaned with riot, who shines like a gallant in silk to day, and
is turned to be more miserable then an hospital to morrow: dicing in the day,
drinking at night, throwing with one hand our wealth away from us and tossing
infirmities and drop^es into our bodies with the other. But the report of these
sins being no refuge to my shame and more fitter to be repented, then by me
to be recorded, I must now tell, I arrived in England, and my name being
known, there was strict wait laid for my apprehention. But see how it
happened: a kinsman of mine who bore my name being by some officers, who had my
search in charge, was suspected and imprisoned for me, and in the end knowing
of my abiding, compeld to give a loath intelligence for his own discharge, he
being hardly set against by those were my adversaries: upon whose instructions
I being apprehended in the west country, and from thence conveyed to the
Marshalseys, I there continued since the beginning of the last summer, till the
time of my conviction, where as in a Mirror I beheld the miseries of other men,
and began now to consider of mine own: after my conviction I was repreeud, by
the painful labor and purse of some of my allies, to restore the memory of
our name vndetected: and now when I little feared or thought of death, I am
brought to be executed: at which place humbled before the seat of his mercy, I
ask pardon at the hands of God, and forgiveness from the hearts of men, and so
thus go up the lather to my death, to go down I doubt not to a peaceful
grave, and to rise at length to my savior in heaven.

Of all which Pirates, gentle Reader, if thou have had intelligence, of more
then I have here set down, I should have been glad to have had thy
instructions, But to him that before this has not known so much, I pray him
to take these collections thankfully, only of Captain Iennings himself and
William Tauerner, of Captain Longcastles company somewhat omitted at the time
of their execution, I will remember now to set down.

Captain Iennings being the first in the commission directed to master Smith
the marshall of the Admiralty, as he was first arraigned and convicted, so he
was the first at the appointed place to suffer execution: and being called by
his name, to commit himself to God and to go up the ladder and suffer death,
he made answer thus: That he hopedno friendly nor christianly censurer would
hold so unconscionably an opinion of him to e^emso carlesly of the good and
future estate of his ^oule, asto come in the face of so many spectators and the
tree appointed for his execution, with a conscience laden with any thoughts,
but repentance or trust in any thing but in the mercy of the redeemer of all
mankind: and therefore what he had to speak, was not to theworld, but to
those of his company, whom he had partly drawn to this folly, and been
causers of their fall: unto whom turning he spoke thus: my friends, you see we
are brought to take our earthly farewell the one of the other, and I am to
conduct you, the way I have heretofore lead you on in place of danger, more
enduring then when bullets like hail have fallen about our ears, yet you
fearelesly and venterously have followed me, your Captain, who have as bravely
brought you of as I have bouldly brought you on: be not dismayed now to do the
like, for where heertofore I have driven you through the footsteps of
transgression on earth, I now wish you be all as resolved as I go before you
the highway to my salvation in heaven, where we shall meet amongst the
fellowship of Angels, although we are here divided from the company of men:
then be no more dreaded to follow, then I guided by the mercy of Christ,
outdaring death, clime up this hill he has built for me: and also resolutly
going up the ladder without saying any other but his prayers, and his thanks
giving, singing a psalm he was turned of. And as for Tauerner he near seemed
to look down on the ground, from the time of his coming to the execution
place to the instant of his death: advancing up the ladder he said thus: I do
faithfully assure my self this is Jacobs ladder, on whose steps I assure I
shall be reard up to heaven, and so he suffered execution. So reader for thy
further satisfaction giving thee the two evidences which were read and
personally given to the conviction of Captain James Harris, and for the true
testimony what is recorded in this discourse, our report is ended.

The examination of Giles Amee Merchant of St. Mallows.
GIles Amee of St. Mallows in Britain Merchant, aged 22. years or
thereabouts, sworn and examined before the Judges of the Admiral^y, by the

says, that he was Merchant of the Margaret of Norsidan, and knows that the
same ship came from Layeborne in Portugal in May last, having in the said
ship eight thousand french crowns, in royals of plate and Pistollets, being
the sum o^ money for linen clo^h and wheat he had sold there.

And being come near the northern cape, the same ship where of William Gillin
was Master: This company was violently assaulted and taken, on the 26. of may
