shop on New-fishstreet hill, under St. Margarets Church, at the sign of the
holy Lamb. 1627.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR HENRY YELVERTON Knight, one of the Justices of
his Majesty's Court of Common Pleas.
RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL;
YOUR special interest in that worthy Servant of Christ, whom this weak work
concerns, by your singular favors to him and his deservedly procured, cannot
but give you interest in the work it self before any. Unto your Worship
therefore I address and direct it, as to one that may justly lay best claim
to it: Not doubting but that, as you did in more than ordinary manner respect
his person while he lived, so you do no less honor the memory of him now
deceased. The work I wish were worthy either you or him. But, how little time
I had for the composing and peecing up of these broken Meditations, cannot be
unknown to those, and from them may be made known to others, that either sent
or brought me the first word of his decease, being newly allighted from a
wearisome journey, not above two days before the Funeral was to be performed.
Besides that so sudden and unexpected tidings of the loss of so dear a
Friend, causing much grief and distractio^, could not but produce withal as
great an indisposition to the minding of that that this office imposed on me
did necessarily require of me; and defeat consequently that second Diligentia

oars, when the wind slacketh or scanteth) to redeem the want of time with.
That which made me (as conscious of the rawnesse of it) the more backward at
first to yield to the importunity of those, (not a few) who both by letters
and by word of mouth were very instant and urgent for the publishing of it. Nor
have I had much loisure since to reuise and digest my confused notes; nor yet
desire to add or alter much, lest (to those that then heard it) it might seem
not the same. One short passage or two only I have inserted, that my memory
then failed me in. Else the substance of all here was then delivered. Which if,
especially in the Testimony then given unto him, whom this office was performed
unto, it seem slight and slender, to that it ought or might have been:
Besides the former considerations, which might well sufficiently excuse, let it
be remembered; what a great Orator sometime said, that Pictores pulchra^
absolutamque faciem raro nisi in peius effingunt. Plin. Sec. lib. 5. epist. 10.
An exact face is very seldom drawn but with much disadvantage: how much more
when a bungler but has it in hand? I may well say of him, as he sometime of

There wanted but his own tongue to commend him with. A better I wish there
had been employed therein than mine own; or that mine own (if but for his
sake) had (at least then) been better. But the best is, The Sea needs not the

yet run into it; nor he either mine, or any other man's praise; that due
honor and reverent estimation of him remaining in the minds of so many, that
neither mine, nor any other man's, commendation of him, either need to add
ought, or can add much thereunto. Howbeit this may bide, when they are gone.
Which whatsoever it is, presuming that your Worship will accept of, if not for
it own sake, yet for his, who lives yet with you, and you desire (I know)
should do so also with others, I recommend it to your patronage, and your
self with all yours to the protection of him who has promised to be (...) Sol

Sepulture then is due to all Christian corpse. But more then so, with some
solemnity may this office well be performed to those, in whom the Holy Ghost
manifested a more special residence by 1 Cor. 12. 4, 6, 11.
a more plentiful measure of spiritual endowments, and more powerful
operations flowing from the same, while they lived; and whom, having obtained 2

This being apparent, good ground there is for this solemn Assembly, which
the decease of our right worthy, and deservedly beloved, and much respected
Christian Brother, M. RICHARD STOCK, a grave and reverend Father in this our
Church, a faithful Minister and servant of Jesus Christ, and the vigilant
Pastor of a neighboring Congregation, for the performance of this last
Christian office to the (...). Resiquiae. Hinc I^l. Scaligeri epit^ph.

Concerning whom and his deportments, howsoever very much might justly be
spoken, and be spoken justly by my self, not from others reports, but of mine
own knowledge, having bin Test^s oculatus: qu(...) auritis d(...)m praefer

an eye witness of them, as having been familiarly and inwardly acquainted
with him ever since the fourth year of his abode in the Schools of the
Prophets, and shortly after the time of my first access thither; (for there
was no more distance between our two standings) yet neither will the streights
of time permit it, nor will it be very needful so to do; his life, and
courses, and constant labor in the work of the Word, being so well known,
not in this, or the neighbor places only, but thorow-out the whole City,
wherein he constantly continued the work of his Ministry by the space of well
near thirty years. I will endeavor therefore to contract (what I well may)
that which I shall speak of him, and hasten to those things that more nearly
concern our selves.

And to begin with the times of my first notice of him. As in his first
beginnings he was of eminent note in the College he lived in, both for his
unweariable industry, and his singular proficiency in those studies of
humanity, that are as Theologiae anc^llari.
handmaids to Divinity, and help to lay a good ground for any future
profession; So his care was so Pietatem huma^ita^i intercalarem facere.
to entertwine pletie and humanity the one with the other, that Tanquam
subtemen and stamen.
as web and woofe they ran on ever along together through the whole course of
his studies. Nor was he careful only of this practice himself, but
(according to that of the Apostle, Hebr. 10. 24.
Observe one another, (...). Quod ex Prou. 27. 17. tractum vid^tur.
to when on to godliness and well-doing;) he was no less forward to incite
others thereunto; and not to incite them only thereunto, but to assist them
therein, and to afford what helps he could (which well also he could do) unto
any that were either desirous, yea, or willing, but to embrace them. In which
kind I cannot without just note of ingratitude but acknowledge my self much
indebted unto him; and have cause (with many others, beside my self, much my
betters) to bless God that ever we came acquainted there with him. In a word,
while he stayed in the College (which his desire was to have done longer then
he did, if opportunity had served) (...). Greg. Naz. in B^sil.
he gave before hand, ere he came to it, evident signs of one likely to prove
(...).
a skillful Master Builder in Gods work, and ^uk (...) 16
a winner of many souls to God.

Nor was he one of those (...).
rathe-ripe wits, that promise fair in the blossom, but fail in the fruit;
that like Comets, blaze brighter than the fixed stars for a time, but after a
while vanish and come to naught, the matter of them being wholly either spent
or dispersed. But his proceedings in public were correspondent to his
beginnings in private. When it pleased God (...).
to call him out and set him apart to that imploiment that he had ordained him
to before, he proved a painful, a faithful Minister of Christ, a skillful, a
powerful dispenser of Gods Word. If any demand proof hereof: not to insist
upon his constant and incessant imploiments, with general approbation and
applause both of religious and judicious, continued for so many years (as was
before said) together, not a Sabbath intermitted, wherein (if health served) he
preached not twice, either in his own charge (where he was frequentest) or
elsewhere abroad; besides his catechisings of the younger sort at certain
times in the week days, and other such offices as to the pastor all function
are necessarily annexed, and are privately to be performed; wherein also he
was no less diligent than in the execution of his public Ministry. Not to
insist (I say) upon this; (which yet were sufficient proof of it:) As the
Apostle says to the Corinthians, (...) Cor. (...). 1, 2.
You are (...).
the seal of my Apostleship, and (...) Co^. 9. (...),

letters testimonial. So may I well say of this our reverend Brother: So many
Christian souls professing themselves to have had their first effectual
calling and conversion from him, (in which kind, I suppose, not many in this
City may compare with him) besides the multitudes of those that acknowledge
themselves to have been edified, built up, and bettred by him, are the seal of
his calling, and of 2 Cor. 13. 3.
Christ speaking in him, and not verbal or vocal, but real letters
testimonial of the efficacy of his ministry, through 1 Cor. 3. 6, 7.
Gods blessing thereupon.

An Jacob. de Vorag. in A^dr. s^rm 4.
obscure Author says, that the Apostles were like Fishermen, the succeeding
Ministers like Huntsmen: Pis^atores praedicatores primitiu^, Matthew. 4. 19. qu^
vno (...) (...) multitud(...) capiunt, ^uc. 5. 6. Joan. 21. 6. Act. 2. 41. and
4. 4.
the Apostles like fishermen that catch many at one draught; Praedicatores
moderni vt venatores, Ier 9. 16. qui cu^ clamo^ibus and laboribus multis vix
vnam feram capi(...)
the succeeding. Ministers like Huntsmen, that with much toil and clamor,
running up and down all day, scarce take one Dear or Hare ere night. And such
indeed is the hard condition of many of Gods servants, that notwithstanding
their faithful and painful discharge of their duty, they are enforced to
complain with the Prophet, Es^^. 53. 1.
who believes our report? and, Es^i. 49 4
I have labored in vain; scarce able to produce or instance in any one, of
whom they can with some good ground of assurance presume, that they have gained
him at least to God. But well might this our Brother, through Gods blessing
upon his labors, stand out and say, not of one or two, but of troops, in the
words of the same Prophet, Esai. 8. 18.
Behold I and the Children, that God has given me; and with the Apostle, (...)
Cor. 4. 15.
These have I begotten to God by the Gospel of Christ Jesus.

Yea more than that; well assured I am, that diverse now famous lights in Gods
Church, and faithful Ministers of his Word, do profess to have lighted their
candles at his lamp, yea some of them to have received their first beginnings
not of light only, but of spiritual life and grace, (without which all light
be it never so great, is no light, but mere darkness) from his Ministry. It is
no small honor for a man to win, and it were but, any one soul: ( Iam.
(...) ^0.
He has saved a soul, says St. James; as a matter worthy the glorying in.)
For Matthew. 16. 26.
to win a soul is to win more than the whole world again is worth. But what
an honor is it then to be, not the winner of a soul, but the winner of such
as prove winners of souls, and so (...) Plut. de (...). (...)ct. cum princip.

instructers of others; that was a conuerter of those that were conuerters of

Many then (as (...). 1. 16.

Lord. Many (I say) he won; though all he could not: that was more then (...)

protest, that it was more comfort to him to win one of them, than to win
twenty other. But some refractary spirits (as Psalm. 58. 3, 4, 5. (...). (...).
Ier. 6. 16, 17, ^8. ^9. 30.

be yet living, the Lord vouchsafe mercy, and better minds to, and Act. 7. 60.

lay not this sin of theirs to their charge. And if there be any of those
that lived any long time under so painful and powerful a Ministry as his
was, that remain still unconverted, vnreclaimed, unreformed, let them fear
and beware of that dreadful censure of the Apostle, 2 Cor. 4. 4.

the heavier, if by timely repentance it be not prevented.

But because a man may win others, and yet lose himself; Non salutis esse
dispensatorem, hoc est salutis etiam esse participem, Aug. epist. 140.
he may save others, and yet not save himself: ( Animam faciunt, etiam qui non
habant. Contra que^ Sen. Non faciunt animum, quia nec habent.
they may beget life in others, that have none in themselves.) The Word may
work by a man, and yet not work on him: He may be Per lapideum canalem

by the one alone paraduenture had not easily been won. In a word; for his
teaching, I doubt not but that they will give him the best testimony that heard
him oftest; and for his life they that knew him best. For he was not a flash;
one of those that show all in a Sermon, or that spend all upon some one curious
good work, that they mind to make their Masterpiece. But both in his life
and teaching he held on such a tenor, that the more men, Vt enim de pictore,
scalptore, fictore nisi artifex iudicare; ita nisi sapiens non potst perspicere
sapientem. Plin. l. 1. epist. 10.
wise and judicious at least, were acquainted with either, Miror magis, quo

happy conjunction of them both was there in this our Brother. For the proof
whereof I may well refer my self to the judgment, both of those that so
frequently desired to make use of him, for the oversight of their last wills,
and for his assistance by way of direction, in the disposing of their estates:
(and we know all, how cautious men are wont to be in that kind:) As also of
those reverend Brethren, of the Ministry as well as other, who, either by

These two then (as he says) make a complete man indeed. But there is somewhat
more required to make a complete Minister, to wit, i that he can k speak his
mind fitly, (for what use of (...). Schol. A^siaph. Plut. Muti siquidem (...)

pregnant similitudes, plentiful illustrations, pithy persuasions, sweet

Much has been spoken, and much more then I intended; and more time taken up
then I made account of. And yet much more might be added, then has been

will miss, that might as justly have been spoken of, and that (it may be)
some of you will deem should not have been omitted. One, his Zealous and

of the younger sort; the males apart one day, and the females another; the

as the rings or circles that rise on the surface of the water, when a stone is

lose and let slip another, and when I would fetch that up again, another
choppeth in, as contending for room with it: And if I should pursue and insist
upon every particular, that either others might expect, or that might justly
challenge a place here time and speech would fail me before matter to speak
of.

To draw toward an end therefore together with his end; the end of his labors,
but the beginning of his resi, the end of his work, but the receipt of his
reward: In these and the like imploiments public and private, he spent his
time, he spent his strength, Sicut l^^erna se consumit in seru(...)um al^orum.
Iac. de Vorag. de Joan Bapt. 6.
like a torch or taper, wasting and consuming himself, for the behoof and
benefit of others, Esai. ^9^.
ha(...)g his work with God then, and his reward for it from God now. And for
these emploiments principally it was that he desired recovery of health and
strength; unto the performance whereof also (though therein injurious to
himself, and contrary to his own desires) he often strained himself, and that
in the midst of his infirmity and weakness, not to the uncertain hazard
only, but to the evident impeachment and impairing of either. Esai. 38. 2^.
What is the Sign, said Ezekias, when he was promised recovery, that I shall
go up to the house of the Lord? as desiring continuance of life and recovery
of health for no one end more then that. And therefore also was this our Brother
so desirous of recovery, that he might repair to Gods house again, that he
might return to Gods work again. To which purpose the very last Lords day
before his decease, having after many relapses recovered a little strength, he
made shift to get out to a neighbor Congregation, there to join with Gods
people in public performance of such solemn service of God as that day is
usually spent and employed in. And having held out to the end with them in both
parts of the day, he reioiced much therein, that he was able so to do; the
rather because thereby he conceived some good hope, that he should be strong
enough ere long, to return to his wonted work and employment again. But the
Lord saw it better (for Psalm. 135. 6. Ephesians. 1. 11.
his will appears by his work) to put an end to his incessant labors here,

to repair it, by raising up many alike qualified and endowed in his room.
With whom now leave we him, and returning home to our selves, afford we a
reverent and religious care to those instructions, that for the fitting and
preparing of us unto the way that he is gone before us, shall out of Gods Word
be delivered unto us.

ABRAHAM'S DECEASE.
GENESIS 25. 8. And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died, in ^good old age, an old
man, and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.
BEfore was a long discourse Abraham's Death.
of Abraham's life: here is a report in few words of his death.

Wherein (to come to Of it four Particulars.
them directly without further preface, because much time is already spent) we
may consider these particulars:

Quis, Who.
Who died;

Quando, When.
How he died;

Q^omodo, How.
When he died; and

Quo, Whither.
Whither he went when he died.

First, who died; Abraham. Particular (...). Quis Person, Who. Point 1.


Whence we may observe, that

No state or condition here freeth men from death.

For who might sooner or better have expected to have been freed from it then
Abraham? Abraham (I say) Genesis 20. 7.
a Prophet of God; Genesis 23. 6.
a Prince of God; I^m 2. 23. 2 Chronicles. 20. 7. Esai. 41. 8.
a special friend of God; Romans 4. 16.
the Father of the faithful, etc. And yet of this Abraham, a Prince, a
Prophet, Gods friend, his favorite, the father of the faithful, is it here
said, that he died; and by the Jews to our Savior, John 8. 54.
Abraham is dead. So John 11. (...), 36.
Lazarus Christ's friend; and yet, John 11. 11.
This our Friend (says Christ) sleeps; that is (as afterward he there
e(...)eth himself) fohn 11. 14.
he is dead. The Luke 12. 4. John 12. 14, 15.
Apostles likew(...) Christ's friends; and yet they are Matthew. 20. 23. Luke 21.
16. John 2^. 19. Act. 12. 2, and 20. 29.
all dead: (For it was no true John 21. 23.

Savior either Sic eum volo manner, etc. Vulg. perperam. Quod sequ^^tur tamen

heart: and yet 1 King. 2. 1.
he goes the way of: all flesh. Zech. 1. 5.
Your Fathers (says the Prophet Zachary) where are they? or do the Prophets
live for ever? And the Jews answer him in the negative, No; John 8. 52.
the Prophets are dead. In a word; as the Psalmist says, that Psalm. 49. 10.
wise men die as well as fools: so Ezekiel. 21. 4.
good men die as well as bad: yea, the good go often before the bad. Esai. 57. 1.
The righteous (says he) are taken away from the evil to come. And of
Ieroboams young Son it is said; u (...). Menand. Plut. ad Apollon. God takes
the^^ soonest, whom he loves best. Mo^^ce t^ epitaph. sui.
1 King. 14. 12, 13. Reason.
He shall die, because there is some goodness in him.

Now the reason why the godly die as well as the wicked, is,

First, if we regard natural causes, Natural. 1.


1. Because they are made of the same mould and metal that others are: 2 Cor.
4. 7.
We have this treasure (says the Apostle) in (...). Testacea vasa. Hier. de
virgin. fictilia. Greg. Mor. l. 3. c. 6. Natural. 2.
earthen vessels: they are but Esai 64. 8.
earthen p^ts as well as Ier. 18 6. (...). Prove. Graec. -- Vulgus fictilis, Qu^
simul offendit ad fortunam, frangitur. Phaedr. fab. 72. Spiritual 1.
others.

2. Because they are subject to the same casualties that others are. For,
Eccles. 9. 2. Cuiuis potest accidere, quod cuiquam potest. P. Sir. Spiritual 2.
All things come alike to all: The same (...) casus.
chance betideth the good and the bad; the clean and the unclean; Malac. 3.
18.
the sacrificer and him that sacrifices not; Zech. 5. 3, 4. Spiritual 3.
the swearer, and him that Iuramentum reuerenti. Iun. timenti. Pisc. Spiritual
4.
fears to swear, that makes conscience of an oath.

Secondly, if we regard spiritual respects.

1. The godly die also that they may rest from their labors: For, Apoc. 14. 13.
They rest from their labors that are deceased in Christ.

2. They die that they may receive their reward; to wit, 2 Timothy 4. 7, 8.
the Crown of righteousness; which they must 2 Timothy 2. 5. Iam. 1. 12.
not expect, till they have (...). Plutarc. contr. Epic.
finished their race.

3. They die, that they may be rid of sin: Romans 8. 10.
they die for sin, says the Apostle: yet not to pay for it, as the wicked
do, but to be Romans 7. 24.
freed from it: For, Romans 6. 7.
He that is dead, is freed from sin.

4. They die, that they may be (...). Antiphan. Moriar? desinam alligari posse,
desinam aegrotareposse, desinam posse mori. Sen. epist. 24.
freed from death it self: 2 Cor. 5. 4.
that mortality (says the same Apostle) may be swallowed up of life.

5. They die, that they may t go to God: For, 2 C^r. 5. 6.
While we bide here in the body, we are absent from Spiritual. 5. (...). Gre
Naz. in Basil, Spiritual 6.
the Lord: and 2(...) 58. (...). Gr^g. Naz. in Patr.
We desire therefore to remove hence, that we may go home to him.

6. They die, that they may be with Christ: Philip. (...) 23. Object. I.
I desire (says he) (...) vti Homer. Ody(...). (...). Solu^re, v^l^ram
soluere: vt Fab. instit. l. 1. P^rm t^amus vela ventis, et oram soluentibus

sit Uid. P^sc. in Luc. 12. 36. Hinc (...). 2 Timothy 4. 6.
to loose, or to be loosed, and to be with Christ.

But against the truth of this point, may some objection be made.

For first, if no state or condition free men from death, how (may some say) it
is said of Enoch, that Hebr. 1^. 5.
he never saw death; and of Elias, that 2 King. 2. 11.
he was taken Answ.
up alive into heaven?

To this I answer, that Pr(...)a siagularia regulam non fa iunt, regulam no^
i^f^ingunt. Priuil^gis sing^^orum le(...)me mmunem ^o s(...)t. H(...)on. in
(...) 1 Bed. n Act.
singular and extraordinary privileges neither make a rule, nor mar a rule.
It follows not, because some one or two of this or that estate or condition
have by special favor been some time exempted from this general sentence,
that therefore the estate or condition it self exempteth any, or that all of
the same estate are exempt and freed therefore therefrom. Esai. 38. 3.
Ezekias walks with God as well as Genesis 5. 24.
Enoch, and yet 2 King. 20. 21.
he died, when his lease of 2 King. 20. 6.
fifteen years expired. Eliseus was 2 King. (...). 7.
a Prophet of God as well as Elias; and 2 King. 2. 15.
the Spirit of Elias (it is said) rested upon Eliseus: and yet 2 King. 13. 20.
he died, and was buried; as appears by the 2 King 13. 21.
miracle, that God wrought by his corpse sometime after his decease. These were
personal privileges: and Pers^nasi^* ^ctio moritur cum I(...) (...). (...).
(...)uris sunt pr(...)legia. N^n sunt amplianda priuil^gia. Ibid.
personal prerogatives pass no further than the persons d Heb^ 9 26.
of those, whom they are conferred on.

But secondly, if even Apo. 2. 10. 13.
the faithful die also, (for Objection 2.
how should the faithful look to escape death, when Rom 4 16.
the Father of the faithful, as we see here, himself dies?) how (may some
say) are the words of our Savior made good where he says; I^bn 8. 51.
If any man keep my sayings, he shall never Mortem videre. i mori. Psalm. 49.
9. and 98. 48. ^eb^. 11. 6. Sicut vid^re vi^am ^i. viuere, I^bn 3. 36. Ineptum

gustare and videre. Answ.
see death; And, Iubn 11. 26.
He that lives and believes in me, shall (...).
never die?

To this I answer, that there is as 1 ^or. 15 45.
a twofold life, so Luke 9 60.
a twofold death: A twofold life; to wit, G^n. 2. 7.
a natural life issuing from the conjunction of the soul to the body; and Rom
8. 10.
a spiritual life arising from the conjunction of God to the soul. And a
twofold death; to wit, Ia^. 2 26.
a natural death arising from the disjunction of the soul from the body; and
Ep(...)s 2. 1, 12 and 4 18.
a spiritual death arising from the disjunction of God from the soul. For
look (...) G^eg. N^z. a(...)g. Q^od an(...)a ^oc Deus est an^mae. Bern. s^rm.
Part 3.
what the soul is to the body, the same is God to the soul. (...)a 73 26.
(...). Isia. P(...) 3. ep. 252. Sicut anim^ v^^a est co^poris (...)ita Deus
vita est an^mae. Ber. ser part 3 V(...)nis an ma est, vita animae Deus est Aug.
deci^it. l. 19. c. 6. and de v^rb. Apost. ^8. and (...) Sanci. 16 A^esse debet,
vt viuat corpus, anima, vt viuat anima, D^us. Ibid.
As the soul is the life of the body, so is God the life of the soul. And
Psalm. 73 27. (...). Isid. ibid. Moritur corpus cum re^edit anima: mo^^tur
anima, si re^^da Deus. Aug. de verb. Apost. 28. Corpus mortu^m est sine anima;
anima m(...) sine Deo. Idem de Sanct. 13. Mors co poris a spiritu deser^; mors
spirit' a Deo. Idem de C^ui. l. 19. c. 26.
as the natural death ensues, when the soul departs from the body; so the
spiritual death follows, when God with-draweth himself from the soul. The
faithful then may dye the natural death: but they never dye the spiritual
death. Eccle 12. 7.
Death may sever their souls from their bodies: but Romans 8. 38, 39.
death cannot cut off either soul or body with them from Christ. The Faithful
may die; and yet our Saviors words true. For (...). Callimach epigr. 14.
Qu^p^^ virtutem (...), ba^d ^s interit. Plaut. Capt. 3. 5.
they die not, even when they die. (...). Chrysostom. in Philip. hom. 3. Quod a
Iudaeo^um doctoribus tractum docet 10. Capnio in Cabal. lib. 1. page 755.
Wicked men (says Chrysostom) are (...). 1 Timothy 5. 6.
dead even while they live: good and godly men Viuunt. omnes Deo, Luke 10. 38.
live even when they be dead. The life of the one is nothing but Per vitam ad
morte^ (...) est.
a passage to death: the death of the other is nothing but Per mortem ad vitam
reditus est. Ambr. de bon. mort.
an entrance into life. For it is Non est vita sed mors dicenda, quae viuentem
a Christo separat.
no life but death, that seuereth a man from Christ while he lives: It is Non
est m. sed v. dic. quae morientem Christo sociat. Idem de Abel. l. 2. c. 9.
no death but life, that brings a man home to Christ when he dies.

And thus much briefly for answer to these two Objections.

Now for the use of the Point.

First, it may serve to hearten and encourage us against the fear and dread of
death. For do all, Use 1.
even the godly and faithful die? Why should we be loath to come to that,
that so many Saints of God have come to before? As Phocion said to one that was
to die with him; (...); Plut. in apophth. and de laud. sui. Isid. Pel. l.
3(...). 154.
Art thou not glad to fare as Phocion does? So, why should any be loath to do
as Abraham does? Or why should we be afraid to go that way, that all the holy
men of God have gone before us? It is true indeed, there might be some
colorable cause of fear, if we were to go some (...). Oppian. venat. lib 1.

uncouth and vntrod way, such as none ever went before us; as Qui cum Horat.
lib. 1. ep. 19. dicere poterat; Libera per vacuum posui vestigia princeps: Non
(...) meo press^ pede.
Abel did when he died. Or if none but the wicked had gone this way before us,
we might justly fear, that it were indeed the high way to hell. But now when
the blessed Saints and the best beloved of God have, either all or the most of
them at least, gone this way before us; yea when he was no wicked but Matthew.

Tuscul l. 1.
God, who loved them so dearly, would never have suffered to befall them, if
it should have been any way prejudicial unto them.

Secondly, do even such also die. This should teach us 1 Thessalonians. 4. 14. Non est
lugendus qui antecedit, sed desiderandus, etc. Cur enim immoderate feras
abisse, quem mox consequeris? Tertul. de patient. Quod latius Cypr. de mortal.

not to mourn or be grieved for the faithful deceased, as if any evil had
befallen them. For if they Apoc. 14. 13.

diminution, either of l^fe, or of their good or happy estate. There is no
cause therefore to mourn for those that die in Christ; there is cause rather
to mourn for those that live out of Christ. For the one lives still though he
die: the other is dead, though he yet live, and shall one day die eternally, if
he continue as he now is. Luges corpus, i quo recessit anima? luge anima^, a
qua recessit D^us. Aug. de Sanct. 13.
Do thou mourn (says Augustine) over the body that the soul has leaft:
mourn rather over the soul that God has forsaken; as 1 Samuel 15 35.
Samuel did for Saul; and as 2 Co^. 12 21.
the Apostle says, he should do for such as had lived in lewd and loose
courses, and not repented yet of them. (...). Chryso^^. in Philip. ^om. 3.
(...). Isid. Pel. l. 1. cp. 334.
Such there is cause therefore indeed to mourn for: But no cause in the world
to mourn for those that are in no worse case, than Abraham and Isaak, and all
the faithful are, that lived in former times, Use 3.
or than others of the same rank shall be hereafter to the worlds ends.

Thirdly, are 2 Samuel 14 14. Romans 4 12. Heb. 9. 26. Mors per o^nes it. Sen.
epist. 95. Mors omnes aeque vocat. Ir^tis d^js propi^jisque mori^dum est. Idem
quaest. not. l. 2. c. 59.
all of all sorts subject to death, as well good as bad, Prophets as private
men, etc? This then should admonish us to make the best use we can of our
religious friends, neighbors, acquaintance, husbands, parents, pastors
especially, while they are with us, ( Io^^ 12 35.
Walk, yea and John 9. 4.
work too, by the light, while you have it with you, says our Savior) since
that Nostros omnes sic habeamus, tanquam nihil nobis de p^rpetuitate, imo nihil
de diuturnitate eorum promissum sit. Tanquam v^^essuris, imo iam recede^ ibus
fruamur. Tanquam extemplo abituros possideamus. Sen. ad Marc. cap. 10.
we know not how soon they may be taken away from us. It is that wherein most
men are generally faulty, that as he says of rarities and strange sights, Ad
quae noscenda iter ingredi, transmittere maria solemus, ea sub oculis posita
negligimus: (...) quia ita comparatum est, ut proximoru^ incuriosi longinqua
sectemur, sed quod omnium rerum cupido languescit, cum facilis occasio est; seu
quod differimus, tanqua^ saepe v^suri, quod datur videre, quoties v^lis
cernere. Plin. sec. l. 8. ep. 20.
when they are near at hand with us, we regard not so much to see them, as we
would, if they were further off, and we should come occasionally where they
were, or as strangers are wont to be, that come out of other parts, whither
they are after a while to return again; because having them at hand, we
think we may see them when we will, whereas the strangers, unless he see
them now, while he is here, thinks he shall never have the like opportunity
again: So we Si^nter eos quos nunquam vidimus, floruisset, non solum libros
eius, verum euam imagines co^quireremus, ciusde^ nunc honor praesentis and

neglect often to make that good use that we might, of the means and the
ministry that God has settled among us, and of our religious friends that he
has settled us with, in hope that we may long enjoy them, and having them at
hand with us, we may make use of them when we will. By means whereof it
comes many times to pass, that mere strangers, that visit them but by
starts, profit more by them, than the most of those do, that constantly live
and abide with them, and that (...). Sophocl. A^ac.
when it is too late now, we come to see and consider to our grief, what
opportunity we have ouerslipped of our own good. It is with us in these c^ses
as it is with us for our books. A book of good use borrowed, which we know
not how soon the owner of it may call for, we are careful to make present
use of, whereas it might chance to have lien long by us, ere we looked on it,
if it had been our own. Well it were therefore for us, if we could seriously
consider, that Rerum natura tibi illum non mancipi^ dedit, sed commodavit Sen.

Particular 2. Quomodo. Manner How. Exposition 1.


And thus much for the first particular, the Person that died, Abraham.

The second follows, and that is the manner how he died, noted in that it is
said, (...) expirauit.
He breathed out, or, He gave up the Ghost.

That which some expound of Aequo ani^o. Calvin.
a willing end, of a willingness to depart: as it is said of our Savior, that
John 19. 30.
he bowed his head down, when all was finished, and (...).
gave up his Spirit. And true it is, that as the Heathen man says, Sapientis
est ^xire, non and e^^ci. Sen. ep. 70.
it is the part of a wise man, rather willingly to go out, than to be thrust
out against his will, so it is the Luke 2. 29. Act. 7. 59. 2 Samuel 15. 26. 1
Pet. 4. 19.
usual practice of Gods children willingly to resign and give their souls up
to God, when he pleases to call for them.

Others understand it De l^ui and leni morte, D. Kimchi and Aben-ezra.
of a quiet end, or an easy end, of dying without difficulty: as it is said
of Jacob, that Genesis 49. 33.
when he had done blessing his sons, he plucked up his feet, and so gave up
the ghost. And it is true also that (...). Pl^t^ Ti. Exception. maeo. (...).

of it self goes out, when the matter that fed it fails.

But because I find the word used Genesis 6. 17. and 7. 21. Numb. 17. 12, 13. and

generally and indefinitely, as well of Job 3. 11. and 10. 18.

strong and violent, as that die voluntary or easy deaths: I take it rather,
that there is in this phrase of speech an intimation of man's frailty, and of
the frailty of man's life. Expiraui^.
He puffed out, or, Spiritum efflauit.
He breathed out; that is, Spiritus defecit.
His breath failed, or, Spiritus ab^js.
His breath went away, and he died.

So that the Point that hence I would observe then is this, that

The life of Man is but a breath, but a blast:

And so consequently the frailty and the vanity of man's life. That which may
the better appear unto us, if we shall consider,

special respects he should make each day to be so (to wit, as his dying day)

should take them so suddenly, that they have not time so much as to think on
it, yet their Esai, 54. 10.

or ability to do ought then, any whit impeach or impair their everlasting
well-doing.

as sincerely, as uprightly, as thou would do it, if thou were to do it,
when thou art a dying; or as thou would do it, if thou thoughtest thou
should die as soon as it were done, that presently after the doing of it,
thou should depart this world, and go to give an account of the doing of it
to God. So do, I say: for Dic tibi dormitur^; Potes non expergis^i. Dic

And thus much also for the second Particular here considerable, the manner how
he died, and the frailty of man's life in the phrase here employed.

The third Particular follows; and that is the time when he dyed.

He dyed, (says my Text).

1. In bona canitie. Genesis 15. 15.
in a good old age, or with a good hoary head; for that the (...) quod a (...)

ent (...) (...) bonis o^eribus; and implentur m^ritis operum suorum.
well spent, well employed, replenisht with deeds and emploiments spiritually
good: (albeit, no doubt, Abraham's old age also, as well as his younger time so
was:)

But good rather naturally; that is,

goodness in that sense goes sometime for greatness:

of grace and goodness, as some: (that is most true indeed also of Abraham,
but seems not here intended:)

But of days, or of years; as it is expressed Genesis 35. 29. 1 Chronicles. 23. 1.
elsewhere: having lived even as long as Vt non appeteret vitae pr^rogationem.
Oleast. ^^lu. M^rt. etc.
himself desired, or so long (as we say) as heart could wish.

Whence the Point, that in the General we may observe, is this, that even

The longest livers die at last. Psalm. 90. 10.
The days of man's life are seventy years; says the Psalmist. But Abraham had
lived a whole 175. Verse. 7.
hundred to that, and yet at length, you see, he dies. Yea that is the
conclusion still ( Enoch. Genesis 5. 24.
one only excepted) with all those Ancients that lived so long before the
flood, (not three or four times, as they say of (...) Homer. Odyss. (...).
Nestor and some Vide pl^n. h^st. not. lib. 7. c. 48. and L^cian. de M^^rob.
other, but nine or ten times as long as the longest ordinary livers live now
adays) Et mortuus est. Genesis 5. 5, 8, 27, etc. Reason 1.
And he died.

Nor is it any marvel, that they so do.

For first, we are of Vitrei sumus. August. de verb. Dom. 1.

we our selves also help often to hasten our own end, while we betray our
selves to him, who lies thus in wait for us, by wilful distemper, by
disorder, by misdiet. As not one apple therefore of an hundred hangs on the

its own weight, but either it is plucked off with the hand, or blown down
with the wind, or prevented of its maturitie by some one means or other: not
one glass, or earthen pot of an hundred, that lasts so long as it might, but
by some mischance or other it comes to its bane: So Pauci ad Senectutem

Secondly, it should admonish us to take heed how we grow too far in love,
either with this life it self, or with the things of this life. Since that,
though we enjoy them never so long, yet we must leave them at last. For 1 Timothy
6. 7. Job. 1. 21. E^cl^s. 5. 14. Nihil intulis^i, ni^il hinc auferes. Aug. de

we brought them not with us into this world; and it is certain that Psalm. 49.

we cannot carry them out of the world with us. If they leave not us while we
live here, P^ou. 23. 6 (...) Ch^yso^. (...). 5. ser. 18. (...). Ibid. 19.
which often also they do; yet (...). Lucian. anthol. lib. 1. c. p. 13. Finem

praef.
we cannot but leave them when we go hence. For all the things of this life
must needs leave us, when our life it self leaves us, whereupon they depend.
Let us so hold, and use these things therefore, that we Psalm. 62. 10. Sap^^ns
d^uitias non in animum, sed in domum recipiet. Sen. de b^at. c. 21.
set not our hearts on them; that we suffer not our Coloss. 3 2.

hang loose about us, that when we shall come to be stripped of them, they may,
as our garments, go off with ease. Otherwise if they (...).
cleave and stick fast to our souls, as clothes are wont to do to an
vlcerous body, the parting one day, with them, which we can by no means avoid,
will be (...). Basil. Caes. hom. 7.

as if some piece of our soul were reaft away together with them.

Yea for life it self, if we love it, (as (...). Aesop. fab. Quis vitam non
vult? Aug. hom. 4.
who loves not life?) let us love that life, that is 1 Timothy 6. 19. (...).

life indeed, and deserves well that name. For this life that we live here, is
in a manner (...); Eurip. Hanc esse morsem qua^ (...)s vita^ du^imus, vitam

no life; it is Quod de arc^^ Herac^^t. (...). Eustath. ad I^ad. (...). Plut.

mortis quaedam pro^xitas. Gr^g. in Euang. 36. Hae^ vita qu^ v(...)us, magis
mors est, etc. Bern. in Psalm. 90. ser. 17.
death. It is no true life that cannot overcome death; that yields to, that
^endeth to, that ends in death.

Thirdly, the consideration hereof should cause us to Luke 12. 15, 22.
surcease and cast off this our immoderate care for the things of this life. As
it has been said by way of reproof of some people, that they used to De
Acragan^^^is Empedo^^^s; (...). Lac^t. l. 8. De Rhodijs Stratonicus, (...).
Plut. de auar. Ideque fere de Megarensibus Diogenes. Tertul apolog.
build as if they looked to live for ever: so it may well be said of many among
us, that they Esai. 5. 8.
purchase, and Jer. 22. 14, 15.
build, and Eccles. 4. 8.
gather goods together, as if they made full account to Psalm. 49. 11.
live ever to enjoy them. Whereas neither are these things able to lengthen
their lives: for Luke 12. 15.
have a man never so much of them, his life depends not thereupon: nor to
keep them from death: for Psalm. 49 7, 8, 9.
no price can procure any immunitie from it: nor to save them in death; for
Prou. 11. 4. Ezck 7. 19.
riches avail not in the day of wrath: nor to avail them after death; for
there will then be no use of them. And for men therefore Eccles. 5. 17.
to beat their brains so much with thought and care for these things, and
Eccles. 4. 8.
to take such pains, as so many do, for the compassing of them, is but Psalm.
39. 6.
to t^ile and moile about that, that they must leave to others at length, and
to inherit Psalm. 49. 17. Eccles. 5. 15.
nothing but Ier. 17. 11. Luke 12. 20.
folly and L(...)s. 5. 16. and 6. 2, 4.
vanity themselves, when others, Psalm. 39. 6. Eccl. 6. 2.
they know not who, Eccl. 2. 18, 19.
inherit the fruit of their labors.

Lastly, this might teach us not to fear death. S^ultum est timere, quod

And thus much for the General, that from this third Branch we observe:

Some Particulars follow; which I will point at rather than insist on.

More specially therefore we may hence further observe;

First, that in some cases Point. Special 1.


To live long is a blessing.

It was foretold Abraham, as a favor, that he should Genesis 15. 15.
die an old man: and it is here recorded that so he did. And it was foretold
Eli, as an heavy judgment that should betide his posterity, that there should
1 Samuel 2. 32.
never be any old man in his house. Long life, as in the Exodus 20. 12. Ephesians.
62. Deuteronomy. 4. 1, 40. and 6 2.
Law it is promised often as a blessing: and God where he describes by the
Prophet the flourishing estate of his people, says, Esai. 65. 20.
There shall no more be, Potest and verti, ex eis, vt ad vtru^que tam
infantulu^ quam senem, r^^eratur illud, Qui n^ impleat dies suos, quod and
Piscatori placet; ^iue, cuius dies Deus non impleat, vt Iun.
from them, or go thence, an infant of days; that is, none of them shall die
young or in infants estate; nor any old man that has not fulfilled his days;

lived so long as in course of nature he well might: but the child shall die
an hundred years old; that is, he that is now a child shall live till he be
so many years old: (which place the rather I recite and open at large, in

He shall not live out half his days; that is, In medio dierum suorum
tolletur, vt Psalm. ^02. 24.
half the time that he might in the course of nature have attained to; says
the Psalmist of deceitful and bloody men.

And well may it be so deemed.

For first, Leuit. 19. 32. (...) Reason 2. (...). Phocylid.
Old age is honorable. Yea, as the Apostle says of Hebr. 13. 4.
Marriage, It is honorable (...). Plato leg. l 9. Apud antiquissimos Romanorum,

a resemblance of Gods antiquity, who is called Dan. 7. 13.

The glory of young men is their strength: (says Solomon) and the beauty of

Old age, or the gray-head, is a crown of glory, that is, (...). Plut. de sen.
polit.
a glorious crown, where it is found in the way of righteousness.

Secondly, It is a blessing to live to see posterity, especially to live to
see withal Gods blessing upon it. Psalm. 128. 1.
Blessed is the man that fears God (says the Psalmist) Psalm. 128. 6.
For (among other things, though it come last, yet not the least) he shall live
to see his childrens children, (that which is recorded also, as a part of Job
42. 16. Reason 3.
Jobs happiness) and peace upon Israel.

Thirdly, it is a matter of grief to men (...). Eurip. Alcest.
more than ordinary, when friends are taken away from them by In ^tatis flore
morientur. (...) Sam. 2. 23. Hinc illa qu^Reason 4. rela, Immaturu^ ^bij^.
Senec. ad Marc. c. 20. Dol^^ illu^ immatura morte indignissime raptum Pl^^. l.
6. ep. 6.
immature death: when the ordinary course of nature is inuerted, and they

bury, those by whom they ought rather to have been buried.

Fourthly, it is a great grace to a godly man, that he may do God any good
service. Such account it their greatest honor, as Act. 5. 41. (...).
Elegantissimum oxymorum. Casaub. S^ (...). Phil. 1. 29. (...). Ignat. ep. 12.
(...). Idem ep. 11. Est and confusionis gloria, and confusio gloriosa. Ambr. in

lives, the more glory may he bring to God, the more service may he do to the
Church and Children of God, be he a public person, or a private; not in regard

ability thereunto: Since that continuance of years bring^th (...). Clem. p^d.

authority with it, procures reverence and respect: The former whereof fitteth
men for the doing of the more good to others, the latter others for the
receiving of the more good from them.

Long life in these respects therefore may well be deemed a blessing.

Secondly, we may hence observe, that it is

A great mercy of God to have a good old age.

It is a mercy more than ordinary for men at those years to be kept free in
some good measure, though not from such weakness as the decay of nature
necessarily imports, yet from such aches, and pains, and grieuances, and
diseases, and annoiances, as that age is wont commonly to be annoied and
pestered with.

For first, (...) Reason I. (...). Sclcrias S^ob. cap. 101. Scolio^ hoc citat
and Pl^^o in Gorg. and A(...)ot. Rhet. l. 2. c. 22 Sed and Plat. leg. l. 1.

Health and the enioyment of it, is at all times a great mercy; ( (...)* Plut.

nothing shows so well as (...). Hera(...) (...). Basil. Caes, hom. (...).
Quid boni hav^at sanitas, languor ostendit. Hier. n. consol. Pa(...).
the want of it at some times, and the inconveniences that ensue thereupon. And
if to enjoy it at any time then be no small benefit, even at such times wherein
others are wont usually to enjoy it: how much more is it a great mercy to have
it at that age, wherein most men are wont to find a much more than usual want
of it? The more infectious the times and places are that we live and abide in,
the greater goodness of God it is to us, if we keep free from infection: So

genus. Iuuen. sat. 10.
old age is subject to diseases and disasters, the greater mercy it is for old
men to be kept free then from either.

Again, it is not so much the bare decay of nature or ab^tement of bodily
strength, as either makes old age so (...): Onus Aetna grauius. Cic. de sen.
(...); Eurip. Bacch. (...); Pherecrat.
cumbersome and burdensome to men, and depriueth them of all alacrity and
cheerfulness of spirit; (you shall see old men, though so weak and feeble,
that they can scarce stir from the place where they are set, yet as Plena ^st

or bodily strength so much, I say, as such (...). Pl^t. ibid. Non proprium
senectutis est vit^um, sed commune valetudinis. Cic. de^en.
pains and diseases as usually accompany old age, that are wont to make it to
be either so tedious to them themselves, that they grow Job 7. 15, 20. Nunc
quia longa mihi grauis est and inutilis aetas, viuere cum nequeam, sit mihi
posse mori. Maxim. eleg, 1.
weary often even of their lives, or that ma^eth them so unprofitable to others,
yea and often so (...). Menand. Tum equidem in senecta hoc depuso miserrimum,
Sentire ea aetate esse odi^sum alteri. Caecil. Vsque adeo grauis vx^ri,

burdensome too, that they grow as weary of them, as they are themselves of
their lives. Which to be freed therefore from, either for the most part, or in
some good measure, in that age, must needs be counted no small merey.

Thirdly, observe we hence, that there is a kind of

Satietie and fullness of life:

not so much, I say, an Quosdam subit eadem videndi saciendique sati^tas, and
vitae non odium, sed fastidium. Sen. ep. 24.
irkesomnesse, and tediousness, (...); Eurip. Menalip. (...). Soph. S^yr.
as Habet enim natura, vt aliarum omnium rerum, sic viuendi modu^. Cic. de sen.
a satietie and fullness; when a man, though not weary of a thing, yet he has
his Vixi quantum satis er at: mortem plenus expecto. Sen. epist. 62.
fill, so much as he desires, of it; to the godly especially; for I find not
the phrase used in the word but of them only; as of Abraham here, of Genesis 35.
29.
Isaak, of Job 42. 17.
Job, of 2 Chronicles. 24. 15.
Iehoiada, of 1 Chronicles. 23. 1.
David, of whom it is said also, that he died 1 Chronicles. 29. 28. Reason 1.
with a good gray head, full of days and riches, and honor.

Now this satietie and fullness of life commonly befalls such;

First, when some special promises of God have been made good to them, or
some special Omnino reru^ omnium satietas vitae facit satietatem. Vitae autem
satietas tempus maturum mortis assert. Cic. de sen.
blessings of God enjoyed by them, correspondent to their own desires. So
Simeon, when he had lived so long ( Luke 2. 26.
which it was foretold him he should do) as to see our Savior in the flesh,
he has even enough of this life, he desires not now to live an hour longer.
Luke 2. 29, 30.
Lord (says he) now let thou thy servant depart in peace; since that mine
eyes have once seen thy salvation, my Savior, and the Savior of all mankind.
So Jacob, when he saw his son Joseph again, whom he had Genesis 37. 33, 35. and
42 36, 38.
given up for dead and gone long ago, not alive only, but in honor, and not
him alone, but his issue too; Genesis 46. 30.
Let me now die; (says he) I have lived long enough; I desire life now no
longer; since I have seen thy face, and that thou art yet alive. For Genesis 48.
11.
I made full account never to have seen thy face; and behold God has made me
see thy seed.

Secondly, where their Sunt pueritiae certa stud^a; sunt and ineuntis
adol^scentiae; sunt and co^stantis aetatis; sunt and extremae sene-Reason 2.
ctutis: istaergo(...) occidunt, fit vitae sa(...), (...). desen.
employments here are at a full point, at a period; when they have done their
task that God had assigned them, and there Non acerbum iam iudicant viuere,
sed supersluum. Senec. epist. 24.
seems to be now here no further work for them. Act 13. 36.
David (says he) when he had served his set time by God assigned him, slept.
And the Apostle Paul, as Philip. 1. 24, 25. Ita Martinus decumbens; Domine, si
adhuc populo tuo sum necessarius, no^ recuso laborem, etc. Sever. epist. 3. and
B^rn. ser. de Mart.
he was content to stay longer in the flesh for the good of the Philippians,
and the furtherance of their faith, then he desired otherwise to do: so he
says on the other side, that Act. 20. 24.
his life was not dear to him, he cared not how soon he laid it down, if so
be that he had fulfilled but the course of his ministry, and that his work it
were once at an end.

The Use of which several Points in a word, may be,

First of the two former, to admonish old men, and such more specially as
through the goodness of Use 1.
God enjoy a commodious and comfortable time of it, free from many such griefs
as they hear others of their years often complain of, to acknowledge Gods
great mercy and goodness to them therein; as Psalm. 91. 16.
in lengthening out their life, and satisfying them with a greater number of
days then others ordinarily attain unto, by means whereof they may live to
see those brought up under them, and bestowed by them, that are of their
charge, and whom God has here blessed them with: so Psalm. 103. 5.
in freeing of them from such annoiances, as are usually attendants of that
age, and which might make their continuance here the more tedious and
uncomfortable to them: And (...). Plut. desen. polit. and de vit. Epicur.
Senectus non modo languida and iners non sit, verum etiam sit operosa, and
semper pro eis, qua^ habet viribus, agens aliquid and moliens. Cic. d^ sen.
to apply themselves therefore to such holy and religious Employments, so far
forth as their present estate and condition shall permit, whereby they may
bring glory to God, and do some service to him, who is so good and gracious to
them above many others in that kind: Remembering withal, that howsoever
Cognatasunt (...), v^ (...). Eustath. Il (...). E^ymolo^. (...). Pythag. l.

found in the way of righteousness, as the wise man speaks, if it be not
religiously employed: And that, howsoever to the godly long life may be a
blessing, yet Es^i. 65. 2^.
the wicked man, (says the Prophet) though he live an hundred years, shall be
but an accursed wretch.

Secondly, the use of the last of these points may be to show a difference
between godly and worldly men. The godly have often even a satietie of life:

worldly men for the most part it is far otherwise: they have never enough, as

That which may well be understood two ways; and the Holy Ghost might well
therein aim at both, because both go under one general, and the phrase as it
may fit either, so Statum mortuorum in genere. Vnde dieu^t Hebr. Qui moritur,

it may well include both.

seem to some, that it cannot be so meant, because Genesis 25. 9, 6.
his corpse was enterred in the Land of Canaan, ( Psalm. 105. 11.
so generally termed) in a strange country, where his contrymen in
likelihood none of them lay: yet it follows not thence, that it may not even

together after decease, be the places of their sepulture never so far

said, to be gathered to his people, though he were buried in some other place
then the most of them were, as Jacob might be said to go to Joseph, because
Genesis 50. 13.
he was to be laid in the ground when he died, Joseph being, as he supposed,

world of Souls, as the Hebrew Doctors call it; to that other world,
(including both Heaven and Hell) in general, that is the Congregation House of
Souls, as the Grave is of Corpses: As Augelum tuiis simulans se Satanas, non

thou and I, and all other good and bad are after decease.

Secondly, more specially; the Souls of Gods Saints and servants may well be
said to go to their people S^v definit (...). Greg. Nyss. in Macrin. (...)

Ancestors are; to the (...). Heb. 12. 23. Q(...)m (...) Doctores (...) (...).

Congregation house (as the Apostle terms it) of the Firstborn, and of the
Spirits of the Just. Nor does it hinder, but that of Abraham it may so also be
understood, albeit that both his Country-me^, the most, it may be of them, and
his Ancestors also, many of them, might be idolaters, as Josh. 24 2.
himself also at first was; since that many yet no doubt of both those ranks,
both were pious, while they lived, and went to God, when they died: Besides
that, well also may they all be termed and styled Ruth. 1. 16.
his people, or countrymen, though little of kin to him otherwise, that were
the people, while they lived, of the same God that he served: Yea as well might

and 6. Omnes hi matorcs tui sunt, si te illis dignum ges. seris. Sen. epist. 44.
all the faithful that went before him, be termed his Fathers, whether he were
lineally and carnally descended of them or no, as Mat. 3. 6. Romans 4. 16, 18.
Gal. 3. 29.
all the faithful that came after him, are termed his sons.

But to hasten to an end:

First, this may serve to strengthen us against the fear of death, or of what
shall become of us when we are dead: Since that, as Ambulat per viam, per quam
ambulauerunt pa^res c^us. Hebr. ex Psalm. 49. 19. O(...)st. sup. Use 1.
we go not any strange way when we die, such as none have gone before us, but
a beaten path, that (...) Josh. 23. 14. 1 King 2. 2.
all, even good, have gone; so we go not to any strange place, where either
none are already, or none that we have any acquaintance withal; but we go to
our Christian friends, to our religious Forefathers, (...). Antiphan. St^b.
cap. 124.
to a place, where we shall meet again with all those, that we Consecuturi
prae misimus. Senec. ad Marc. c. 19 Eo cito peruenturi, qu^ illi peruenerint.
Idem ep. 63. 2 Samuel 11. 23.
sent from hence before us, having deceased in the faith. It is that indeed
that much troubles men and women many times, when they are enforced to travel
into strange countries, and to change the places of their wonted and ancient
abode; to fore-thinke, what an uncouth thing it will be, to come among a strange
people, where they know none, and none know them. It would have troubled Jacob
not a little to have removed into Egypt, had he not been Genesis 45. 58. and 46.
3, 4.
sure to find Joseph there. But the godly need not be troubled with any such
thoughts, when they are to remove hence: For they shall go to their own
people, their Friends, their Fathers: they shall be sure to Mutamus amicos, non
r^linqu^m^. Hieron. in Nepot.
find countrymen, kindred, acquaintance enough in heaven, that will be

ready to receive them, to welcome them thither, to give them the best
entertainment that can be there. Yea this should make us the rather desirous to
die and to go hence, Equidem efferor studio patres vestros, quos colu^ and
dilex^, vid ndi. Neque vero eos solum conu^nire aueo, quos ipse cognoui, sed
illos etiam de quibus audiut and legi. Cie. de. sen.
that we may go to, and be with those worthies, whom either having known here
our selves, or having read of, or heard report of from others, we have admired,
and desired either to see, or to live with, while they lived here.

And lastly, if we desire to go to them when we die, let us be sure to follow
them while we live. Psalm. 119. 63.
Adioine thy self to them, associate thy self with them, while thou live
here, if thou desire to be with them, and to partake with them, when thou
departest hence. Romans 4. 12.
Walk thou must in the steps of faithful Abraham, while thou live, if thou
look to have a place Luke. 16. 22.
in Abraham's bosom, when thou die, and Matthew. 8. 11.
sit down with him, after this life, in the kingdom of heaven. Oh (it may be
that some of you will s^y of this our blessed Brother now deceased) that my
soul were where his is: that I might be sure to die as he did, and to go
whither he is gone, when I die. Hear what the Apostle says; he points thee
the way, he tells thee how it may so be, how thou may have thy desire.
Hebr. 13. 7.
Think upon those (says he) that have had the oversight of you, and that have
declared the word of God unto you; and follow their faith, considering what the
end of their life has been. Be not like Balaam, N^m 23. 10.

follow the rules that he taught thee, Philip. 2. 17, 20.
go the way that he led thee, by life as well as by lesson, while he lived;
and then shall thou be sure to go to him when thou die, and to enjoy there
with him and other the faithful gone before thee, those joys and that bliss,
that with God and Christ they are there fully possessed of already.
