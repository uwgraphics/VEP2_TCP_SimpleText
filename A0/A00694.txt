TO THE PERFECTION OF HONOR, My Lord HENRY, EARL of South-hampton.
WHilst other men study your Titles (Honorable Lord) I do your Honors; and
find it a nearer way to give actions, then words: for the talking man commonly
goes about, and meets the justice at his errors end, not to be believed. Yet,
if in modest actions, the circumstances of singularity, and profession hurt
not; it is true, that I made these Compositions solely for your Lordship, and
do here profess it. By which time, I have done all that I had in purpose, and
return to my silence:

Where you are most honored by Alfonso Ferrabosco.

TO THE WORLD.
LEast I fall under the Character of the vainglorious Man, in some opinions,
by thrusting so much of my industry in Print; I would all knew, how little
fame I hope for, that way: when beside his, for, and to whom they are, I aimed
at no man's suffrage in the making; though I might praesume, that could not but
please others, which I was contented had pleased him. But, as it is the error,
and misfortune of young Children, oftentimes to stray, and loosing their
dwellings be taken up by strangers; and there loved and owned: So these, by
running abroad having got them false Parents; and some, that, to my face, would
challenge them; I had been a most unnatural Father, if I had not corrected
such impudence, and by a public declaration of them to be mine (when other
means abandoned me) acknowledged kind. This is all the glory I affected, to
do an act of Nature and Justice. For their seal, they had it in the Mint, or
not at all: Howsoever, if they want it, I will ease my self the vice of
commendation.

Alfonso Ferrabosco.

TO MY EXCELLENT FRIEND, ALFONSO FERRABOSCO.
WHen we do give, Alfonso, to the light
A work of ours, we part with our own right.
For then, all mouths will judge; and their own way:
The Learned have no more privilege, then the Lay.
And, though we could all men, all censures hear,
We ought not give them taste, we had an ear:
For, if the humerous World will talk, at large,
They should be fools, for me, at their own charge.
Say, this, or that man they to thee prefer;
Even those, for whom they do this, know they err:
And would (being asked the truth) ashamed say,
They were not to be named, on the same day.
Then stand unto thy self, nor seek without
For Fame, with breath soon kindled, soon blowneout.
Ben: Ionson.

Jn lode dell'arte, and dell' Authore, SONETTO.
S'Ogni art tanto piu da noi s'apprezza,
Quanto ha piu nobil senso per oggetto,
and quanto n'e peu degno il soggetto,
Vince l'altre arti harmonica dolcezza,
Quella a dar gusto and contento s'auezza
Al nostro vdir, de sensi il piu perfetto;
Per sogetto h'a numero vguale, and retto,
and di bella aria, and tuoni la vaghezza.
Questa art dungue essendo di tal merto,
Alfonso mio, chi d' Orpheo ports il vanto,
Conuien pregiarti, and quests tuoi concenti*
Tanto piu ch'essi con doppio concerto,
A gl'istromenti attando il dolce canto,
Di piacer doppio ne appagan le ment^.
Gual: Quin.
