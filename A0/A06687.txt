To the Worshipful Master Henry Prannell, I. M. wishes health and
prosperity.
WOorshipfull Sir, it has been an old and ancient adadge, and that vbique in
generality confirmed, namely, that good will may be blamed by some curious
carpers, that with Gorgon belch forth their venom against the simple, but to
excuse such as mean well, Hope to beat down fear and to overthrow
despair, sets in her foot, to animate the virtuous to persevere and go
forward in their well dooinges, confirming the old approved proverb, with this
assertion, (though truth may be blamed says she, yet shall good will in
truth be never ashamed: thus in this cause Hope is an instrueme^t sent from
the heavens, stops the mouths of monstrous Momus, oppresses the outrage of
Zoilus, and gives to the honest and good minded, a corsselet of proof to
encounter against the ceaseles scandalls of the wicked: This hope of your good
liking, has made me bold to acquaint and deliver into your hands this small
pamphlet, namely, Phillippes Venus, but to present Apollo with Pans Oaten Pipe,
or Diana with a Distaffe, it were a thing ridiculous, but hope pleads good
will, and says your wisdom will franckly condescend to cover the defectes,
that through mine unskillfulness shall herein be coutched. Sinates delivered the
Persian King Artaxerxes a handful of fair water, which his sovereign
thankfully received, I in respect of his gift, come unto you with a gift far
inferior, and yet I assure you my good will strives to counteruaile his
courtesy, but had I the precious pearls of Patroclus, or the golden Sands of
Ganges: I could find in my heart to make you the owner of them, as well as I
have chosen you to be the patron of my travail, under whose buckler of defense
I have committed my Book to the printers press, but because I will observe
decorum, and avoid teadiousnes, this sinode and solemn parliament holden of
the Gods and Goddesses in sacred Olympus, shall reveal a plain and simple
method, the occasion and effect of Phillips Venus, the which as time and
leisure, setting aside your searious affairs, shall permit you, I am fullye
persuaded you will thoroughly peruse and read: that done, I trust you will give
your censure in such sort, that hereafter I may be encouraged to publish some
other treatise, which may further delight you. Thus leaving you to the
merciful and gracious protection of the almighty, I bid you most heartily
farewell.

Your woorships to command Io. M.

Phillippes Venus.
WIthin the high and ancient Olympus, high by reason of his virtue, and
ancient for antiquity: was there holden a regal and princelike Parliament,
by the sacred Synod of all the Gods and Goddesses. The cause of their sitting,
was by reason of a great slander raised through the outrageous fullyes of that
vain and wanton Venus, whom by a common consent for her ficklenes, was
banished the compass, circuit, and scope of the stately and orient Heavens.

She exiled, the Senate was quieted, contentions allayed, and all things well
pacified: but as there is no counterfaite without his blemish, no blossom but
has her blast, nor flower without his branne: so to that commodity, was added
this discommoditie: that her seat being now void of a sovereign, her place
of a Princes, and guard of a Goddess: caused Cupid to care, Mars to mourn,
but Vulcan to smile: rumors ran throughout the Senate, and privy mutterings
heard, in every Session daily bills were exhibited by the Amorous, and the
Lover pleaded for his Lady as he would have done for his life: there might you
have seen the sad looks of the Ladies, the heavy countenance of many a
carped Knight, and like Aesops frogs so importunate for a Queen, that had not
Jupiter been in a merry mood, twenty to one it had made him stark mad.

At the last, (for what will not inuocations entreat, and daily prayers
obtain) it was decreed by the whole house, that an election should be made to
supplye the want of a Godde, and satisfy the petitions of the people, and thus
it was.

THere was among the seemly train, attending the Goddess Diana, a Nymph of
such passing beautye and singular virtue, that I may doubt whither to commend
in her the exterior shape of the body, or interior habit of the mind: her
sad countenance or sage counselles: her modesty, gestures, or merry glauncings,
the sharpenes of her wit, without wantonness or sweetness of her speech, without
wilfulnes, the attire of her body was comely, yet not too costly: her
ornaments all seemly, yet nothing superfluous: for the most part so singular,
that she excelled all other of her ser, in all things so rare, that she seemed
rather a Saint, then a subject: and to write without partiality, who ever
beheld her, would rather judge her a mate for the greatest God in heaven, then
a companion for the mightiest Monarche on earth: more like Phoebus Sister, then
her servant: and better beseeming a Goddess, then the hand-maide of a Goddess.

This Dame was by birth royal, in behavior courteous, bearing a shape
importing her own name Venus, the modesty of her Mistress Dyan, pallas wit,
and Iunoes majesty, Lucretias faith, with Artimesias loyalty: In stature not
of the tallest, but indifferent in all proportions, nothing mean but absolute
and excellent: so that should I note with my pen the half of her perfections,
I should therein err with my pen, and sin in peeuishnes.

This seemly Saint or rather gallant Goddess (for what was it her beautye
might not promise? and her virtues perform? my Venus attending the entrance
of the Capital, the interuent and coming of her Lady Mistress, was not so
happy as wished for, espied of the mighty Jupiter, who beholding her bountye,
but admiring her beauty: so far excelling the rest her fellow Nymphs in
bravery, as the Sun in brightness exceeds phoebae, or phoebae in bigness the
little Boetes, walked up and down as half in a mamering devising some strange
shape to entertain his rare Mistress.

Now adjoining to the entrance of the Capital, was there an outward chamber
curiously hung with a stately Arras, wrought with gold and richlye beset with
Turkasses, Saphires and Diamonds, as best beseemed the majesty of so brave a
place, and the presence of so heavenly persons: here before they entered the
Capital, which was richlye embost with roofes of beaten gold, and pillarde
with Iet, round wrought and beautified with Emeralds and Crisocolles, did the
Gods make their first obuent, and deck them with robes wherein they sat the
day before in the Senate.

In this place sat all the waiting Nymphs, attending the coming of their
Lady Goddesses: and as that time fell out, mistrusting the house would fit
longer then their accustomed manner: desputed how to drive the day in some
merry method, wherein every one past her censure, till Venus in the midst gave
after this manner her sentence.

Ladies (quoth she) and my fellow Nymphs, to make a long process to little
purpose, or to use many words to little worth, were but to pull Hercules
shoe on a Childs foot: to burn one Candle, in seeking another: to exercise
our tungs, fill our ears, but deceive our expectations: to talk of war,
were too unseemly for women of Science, not fitting our sex: what then?
Love, that in truth best is beseeming Ladies, and sithence we all study which
way to pass the time, let us all conclude to use some merry pastime: whereto
all agreeed, and liked so well of the motion, that without further speech,
they made up the match, and said it should be love: Their order was thus, she
that cunningly and most comely could court little Ganymede, should be
mistress of her fellows, and Lady of Love for that year: and by whom
should the trial be, but by the Boys troth, that being tied to his fancy,
might all rest under his favor, and whom Ganymede said I love, to her should
fall the lot.

Now was the Boy at the nether end of the Chamber, whither it were knitting of
true loves knots in rishes to try his wits, or making or Puppits to pass the
time I wot not: but Venus skipping lightlye from her seat, ran hastily to the
child, and catching him in her arms, kissing the prittie wagge, placed him
with the women.

Ganymede whither gessing shrewdly at the matter, or groping subtly (as the
wanton well could) at women's minds: why Venus said he, will you ravish me
before all this company, or rifle me amid this crew? it becomes not Nymphs
of Dians train, to entermeddle with Pages of Jupiters troop: fire and water
agree never in one vessel, it is dangerous to cast flax to fire, Apples to
Children, liberty to Lovers, were it not for the place Venus, I would hardly
like your practice: Coy elfe (quoth Venus) are you so collerick? no Venus,
(answered Ganymede) take heed you wax not frantic, for women speak not until
they be spurred, but put once out of their mean, then are they past all mean,
because you should not fall into a mischief by reason of idleness: I did but
whet your wits Venus, to find you exercised, for this age is wicked, subject
to many euilles, and the house sits long, and I wist not how you would spend
the day: to court Ganymede, said Cyane, and why so? replied Ganymede, to
whet your mind or my manners: both answered Venus, for by our controversy
shall Ganimede find our conceit, and by thy judgment shall we know Ganimedes
wit: if that be all Ladies (said he) begin when you will, Ganimede is with you
and for you. Have with you then quoth Cyane, and Ganimede let this exordium be
for you.

Where the late adultresse Venus was wrapped with desire of her fair Adonys, no
bird nestled her breast but beauty: when in pride of her dietie, she graced
Phao with an extraordinary favor: what was the greatest gift but beauty? and
what Venus I wot not striving in thy nature Ganymede to excel her Art, has
more then naturally enriched thee with a hue of greater (if greater may be)
then excelling beautye: if Venus were with her own works taken, no marvel
then if Cyane be with so exceeding a power ouer-taken: I love Ganimede, sweet
Ganimede I love, I love thee, yea thee, a fairer then whom, is not contained
in compass of our Sphere, or of greater beautye, no one rests here in
Olympus: if the Gods for a favor of their inferiors to enrich them with any
blessing of liberality, grant them love: if our Lady mistress in favor to
their Gods, have no greater grant then love: if love made the King of our
Capital become little Cupids captive, drive Juno to jealousy: and Cynthia
though she seem surely to smile sometime on her well-beloved Endymion: but if
Ganimede in my disputation grauiled, make any doubt of my device: Mars,
Neptune, yea Pluto and wise Apollo himself, shall satisfy him in loves
perfections and praises.

Thus I love Ganimede, yea Ganimede I love, then let not Ganimede repaye for
love, hate: but carrying beautye in his forhead, harbor Excomesis love in his
heart: for beauty long since and love were both conjoined in an endless league
of amity: if beautiful, then is Ganymede louelye: and therefore louelye
because beautiful, ah witles Cyane, what ambiguitie doubtest thou in Ganymedes
love, that shines so orient in pride of his beautye, but admit beautye were
not Cyane.

Yea marye, said Ganymede, here I join with Cyane, for admit no beauty in
Ganymede: yet answered Venus (standing by) bereave not Cyane of her beautye
Ganymede, for it is her life: nor of life Dorye another Nymph standing by,
least you loose her love: I admit them (concluded) Ganymede, both Cyans beautye
and life: because she shall not perrish in her love, all this is but a pause
said Venus, to bring Cyane to her purpose: yet hardly answered Cyane shall I
proceed, if you thus pen me from my purpose: howbeit to make up her medlye,
forward she goes in this manner.

Let not the modesty of thy years sweet Ganymede, frustrate the defart of my
praises, but lengthen my life with thy beauty, thou will grace my beauty with
thy love: unfitting were it, fair Jupiters Page should now become foul
ingratitudes Prisoner: I tell thee Ganymede, to forget injuries is not the
meanest point of wisdom: to reward defart, the highest type of a true
Trophea, whither was Alexander more famed for his victories of the world, or
infamous for the slaughter of his faithful Clytus? ingratitude I tell Ganymede
has frustrated mighty Princes of the love of their people, has decayed
Kingdoms, and ruinated the weal of the happiest world: if any Ganymede
could but discearn what difference there were in remundicating a sweet
desert, and practice of a scorning desire: what destinction between a pleasant
replye, and a displeasing repulse: greater should be his sweetness exercised in
these virtues, then others virtues practicing no such sweet.

He that has read the Trophies of the Romain triumphs, shall there find in a
Princely breast, a princelike bountye: who for the purchase of ease, repaies
with reward of life: perfourming a regal office in a Lions nature: well may
he be termed a King, that Kinglye deals with his vassailes: showing that in
greatest personages, ought to harbor greatest virtues. Sweet mouse, in this
let me entreat thee resemble Aesops mouse, that as he with his teeth released
the Lions thrauldome, thou with thy tung untie thy Goddess bondage: ease her
thoughts, whose heart faints with the burden of thy beautye; and make thy
sovereignty rather pleasing by thy liberality, then indurate through thy
tirannie: so shall thou be honored with thy inferiors, praised by thine
equalles, and loved of thy superiors: carrye with thy Lions looks a Lions
mind: who being King over my thoughts, become princelike in thy deeds.

And is there among mortal wights a thing of more immortal resemblaunce then
love? divine are his causes which works divine effects, and a matter without
compare for form, whose incomparable form makes so rare a matter: were
Aristotle here to divine his principio, or Plato to distinguish of his cause:
they both would recant their blind ouer-sight, and consorting them with me,
commend my brave in-sight: look about Ganymede, and behold this goodlye
Theatrum of the heavens, praise the Skies with those glorious Lamps of thine,
and ouerviewe the base earth, and tell me if either far or near, above or
below: there be any thing of greater compare then unity.

Seeste thou not what a heavenly hermonye there is of celestial, reunited by
great art to uphold a great charge, where nothing is superfluous, each one
serves orderly the other, the Sun imparteth her light to the Moon and
Stars, the Moon and Stars with due proportion lymiting times and seasons:
bodies below governed by powers above: yea, there lives not one person, but
is guided by a Planet: one is crossed with adversity, he has felt the fury of
angry Saturn: another lives pleasant, fast bound in wedlockes sacred bands:
who doubts whither Juno has showed her his fauoritie, some fortunate in
enterprises, some I account safe sholded with the majesty of Jupiter, other
some triumphant in the conquest of their Ladies loves: then erst our Venus
flattered in her pride, and this is too manifest a pre-eminence over
th'inferiours, to ye end they might honor and love their superiors.

Now let not Ganymede born on the earth, but nursed in the heavens: loved of
the Gods for his beautye, but honored among men for his dietie, become
unnatural, so goodly graced with all the ornaments of a divine nature: if
neither the earth that bread thee can challenge any of her right, yet let the
heavens that harbor thee, receive somewhat for their due: then least striving
to become more then a God, thou prove less then a man: repugne not heaven and
earth, least being an enemy to ye one, thou prove odious to the other and
less favorable to me, scarce acceptable to thy self: be not so strait laced
Ganymede in thy conceit, nor have no self will which engenders a self woe:
carry in thy sweet body a sweet mind: content is greater riches then a
Kingdom, and love nothing inferior to life: be as thou seem, a God for
beautye, and seem that thou ought, to be more then a God for thy bounty:
imitate him, whose commaundes makes him thy master Jupiter, and be not coye to
thy mistress: accept the courtinges of Juno, the one shall enrich thee with
great honors, the other honor thee with fortunate matches. Here would Cyane no
doubt have continued a long content, had not Ganymede (turning to Venus)
interupted her process with this parliance.

Believe me Venus, Cyane has laid on load for her love, and hardlye she
galleth me for ingratitude: but concearning the beauty she treats off, I
neither yield the conceit, nor consent: but tell me Venus, is not Cyane a
merry wench? it is but her custom Ganymede, and nothing strange among us
Nymphs said Venus, to be pleasant.

But tell me Venus (replied Ganymede) are all Nymphs thus pleasant? yea,
answered Venus, al pleasing Nymphs, of the which number now strives Cyane to
be one: and I allow her contention, if you allow it: Ladies (said the Boy)
then must Ganymede needs like it, yet will I reserve a further sentence, till I
hear further saying.

Here Dorys because she saw Cyane interrupted, sitting in a greter muse, burst
suddenly into these terms of purpose to raise mirth: Ganymede (said she)
women men say, are of their first lovers passing coy, of their last passing
curious: fear causing the first, love the latter: whither of these I wist not,
Cyane is fallen into, so that if you suspense some censure, you deprive Cyane
of her sense.

Clymen another Nimphe standing by, replied upon Dorys in this manner: not of
sense, but of conceit: she has done so superlatiue well, that I judge her
wrapped into a second heaven.

Cyane hearing them descanting thus on her plain song, to mar their music
rowsed from her muse, and with a stearne gesture, such as women use when they
are waspish: thought to conclude her tenor in some discording tune, had not the
house disagreeing on certain points, suddenly been dismissed, and they
compelled by constrainte to attend their Lady Goddesses, where I must leave
them to their service, my self tied to their secrets: whom because I may not
reveal, for that they belong to women, I will rest with Phoebus, and expect
Auroras glad appear.

BY this had Tytan taken his restie Steedes, and traced them unto his Chariot,
when Mercurye ye swift winged messenger saluteth him from the King of Gods
after this manner.

Fair Phoebus said he, from my Father Jove I have to greet thee, and thus it
is: he craves thy presence to sit with him in Parliament: shall, said Apollo,
then fair Terra be of her light be refte? not so (answered Hermes) for this
day the heavens as erst with sable clouds shall over mantled he: so that thine
absence is no miss to men, and yet as acceptable will it prove to the Gods:
and to avoid Dame Tellus distemperature, my Father will dispose a plot that
best may fit their profit.

Short tale to make, it was not long before that all address and betake them
to their sollemne counselles, whose decrees because they egresse my purpose,
they must exceed my pen, Qui supranos, nihil ad nos, Stars may be poynted
at, but not pulled after: me list not treat of the secrets of Gods, being the
mean of al men: nor intermeddle with the heavens, least with the Typheonis I be
overwhelmed in the earth: I had rather sit in the Sun with Irus, then rule
the Sun with Phaeton: creep on the earth with the Ant, then soar in the
heavens with Icarus: I leave the Capital too high for my capacity, and
return to the great Chamber where are sitting my merry company, whom may I
smoothely bring to this days end. I shall perform such a task as will glad
me for ever.

Dorys and Clymen have gotten them to a corner of the Chamber, as it should
seem to talk of their late nights rest, or early mornings rising: Venus
alone in a bay window was busy beholding the fair fruits of Flora, who in
great bravery adorned a garden plot prospectiue in the Chamber lights: Cyane
no sooner entered the presence, but she began to descant on the former days
parliance, and with the very sight of the place renewed her old passions:
Ganymede (his Lord young Ops, now newly entered the Capital, because he would
not sit expecting the aduent of his adherents) had no sooner recovered the
Chamber, but pryed for his companions, who that day were to hold the chat: and
soothelye to say, had not Ganymede driven Cyane from her dumps, very
mellenchollye of mind had brought her to her death: which sad comfort when
Ganymede had well viewed, he fell immediately like a prittie wagge into his old
vain of wantonness: running in all the haste to Cyane, crying arm, arm, arm:
Cyane half amassed, skipt soddainly from her seat, and Clymen with Dorys brake
off their silent whispering, when Venus at his words began to turn from the
window, seeking the author of this sudden alarm, who espying Ganymede
encompassed with the company, with her silver voice refoundeth these words,
the messengers of her conceipte.

In faith (Sir wagg) come you so suddainlye crying for arms? no doubt by that
all have said, you will shame your art: be it with shame or honor Venus says
he, I will bring it all to end: Nyphe, Hyale, and Ramys, with all the rest of
the Nymphs, being at the nether end of the Chamber, and beholding them
conuocated in a cluster, not unlike their former days order-mused much of the
match, and drew something near to understand the matter, the which by diverse
circumstances having gathered sitting each by her fellow, expecting what would
be the greeting: whose presence Ganymede beholding, fearing every one to cast
in her verdict, which in his opinion seemed very vain, began with this caveat
to give them all the canuas.

Ladies said he, I being here elected as judge, adiudge on pain of my
displeasure, no one Nymphe open her lips to speak among this presence,
except Dorys, Cyane, Clymen, and Venus, wherewith every Lady repast her
laughter, demanding Ganymede to whom he would grant his leave: to Dorys
answered Ganymede, wherefore speak Dorys be it but to win the praise. Dorys
looking Ganymede steadye in the face, beholding his countenance and ye rest of
her crew, between earnest and jest, shot forth her bolte in this or the like
bente.

Cyane in her yesterdaies courtinges, grounded her gracious love Ganymede on
thy looks, measuring thy bounty, by thy beautye: but of a contrary censure
frame I my fancye by thy fame: preferring thy wit before any other
worthiness, my reasons in a word are these.

The chaste Penelope chose not the great Lord of Ithica for his wealth, but his
wisdom: nor Andromache, Hector for his valor, but his virtue: so took
Sulpedia, Lentulus: and Hypperstria wedded the Philosopher Crates, infinite
were examples, should I dwell in their repetition, being extant in wit, and
tried by experience: I will not here enter in the discourse of wit, but leave
you to suppose it greater then it is by conjecture, then find it less then it
ought to be by trial: but this have I heard diverse men say, being my self but
a woman, that wit bewitcheth, when wealth wearyeth: Invention and disposition
Rethoritians tell me, are two diverse things by their diverse rules, not so hard
is the invention in getting, as the disposition in keeping when it is gotten:
Kingdoms are easier conquered, then kept: and Lordships sooner purchased then
love: one thing is cast away in a moment, that was not composed in a month:
Troy was but a day burning, that was ten years conquering: the foolish
fisherman that let the Eeele slip through his hand into the water, was not so
glad of his taking up, as sorrowful for his slyding down: the gifts of
fortune are transitory, tied to no time: the gifts of nature permanent,
during in all times.

I account it here no fault my Ganymede to be beautiful, but a commendation
to be witty: nor scorn I him that has wealth, but honor him that is wise:
wit will get wealth, but wealth shall never purchase wit: and yet both wit and
wealth agree in the brauest sympathye: counsel makes the meanest comelye, but
comlynes sildome or never counsels: and yet comelynes where is good counsel,
is a grace that gives the brauest grace. I remember a Gentleman in my time
moving an Italian question to an English Lover, referred him in his choice to
the election of three changelings: the first a fair fool, the second a wise
wanton, the third a crooked Saint: because of every one he has discussed so
well, I shame to say any thing except I could do better. Hyperchyon never
strained his voice after he heard Orpheus play on his Harp: the Black-birde
represseth her notes where the Nightingale sound out her lays: I could here
recite to Ganymede, the commodities and pleasures reaped by the profit of wit,
were not the repetition needless, being already known, and the knowledge
manifest, taught by daily experience: what attempteth not wit? what causes
not wit? what offers not wit? which discovers the eminence of evils, and is
a sovereign medicine to recure their maladies, tries the secrets of Ladies
thoughts, and enters conqueror into their daintiest hearts. Agamemnon had a
kingly grace, but Paris a courtely gesture: Ajax fought hard for Achilles
honors, but Ulysses pleaded better that got away his armor: why preferred
Cornelia a poor Miller before a wealthye Mizer: and Cyrca a bell to enchaunt
many millions of men to dispell her enchauntments, showing her self too much
like a woman.

Shall I tell Ganymede what the famous Epyrote Pyrrhus could do with his wit,
and eloquence of Blundus, entitled Roma Triumphanta, do not deceive me, who
says, that this Pirrhus was so eloquent and wise, that the man with whom once
he had spoken, remained so much his, that from that time forward in his absence
he took his part, and declared his life in presence: the said Blundus also
says, and Tytus Lyuius affirms the same: that as the Romans were of all
things provided (seeing he was of so rare wit and eloquence) for him were they
so provided, that no Roman Ambassador conferred in his presence, but by the
mediation of a third person, otherwise he would so allure them with his sweet
words, that they returned perfourming matters of little worth.

And there-vpon I conclude that Ganymede being witty, must be beloved of
Ladies by constraint, and honored of duetye: So now Cyane affectes Ganymede
for his beauty, Dorys for his wit thy countenance making a breach (Ganymede)
into Cyanes breast, thy wit woorking wonders in Dorys thoughts, if therefore
Ganymede be beloved for his beauty, shall he be hated for his wit? if for his
outward shadow, why not then for his outward virtue? for by that time beautye
has cast her Cards with indifferencye, she shall want many an ace of wit.

Here Dorys very earnest to have proceeded to her purpose, was interrupted by
Clymen, with this merrye process. Your wit Dorys is so good, that if we make
you not to pause, you will make us pant: what, what now Dorys? wit whither will thou? Ganymede to give C^^^^ns clause a close with this verdue, cast in his
verdit: Dorys said he in wit, is a Doctor, who to prove me for wit singular,
gives us occasion to think Dorys for wit past compare: I would I were Dorys,
so wise to find women's wyles, or my own weakness: then turning no further then
led by reason, I need not for want of judgment incur such Ladies rage.

Venus perceiving Cyane all this time so mute, who erst was ever wont to be
merry, thought by some prittie deceit, to have driven her from her pensive
conceit, between mirth and game uttering this gloss: while you treat of wit,
others talk of war: you are amid your mirth, but Cyane mornes with
melancholye: trust me the Lady either feeds on pills, or on displeasure, her
taste seems so untoothsome: why how now Cyane? I pray you Lady what cheer?

Cyane was stung with Venus tale, and though at first she began to stand, yet
bethinking her self better, she recovered her strength, and because none
should know where the show wrong, but she that wore it, with this prittie
gloss played on her game: I have fed Venus (said she) too rife on Dorys
reasons, so sweet is her fruit as if she bore forth Figs: Heereat Dorys
thought to catch Cyane at the nyck, requiting her courtesy with this prittie
quippe: Cyane (answered she) ever caryeth a sweet tooth in her head, and a
sweet thought in her heart, beauty breeds no other, love as much.

Here Jupiter having been something earnest in certain causes discussed in the
Capatal, suddenly rose from his seat, forsaking the Senate: the rest he
commanded to tarrye, because he would have further trial, leaving the^ alone
to have a sight of his love: softly therefore descended he the Capital; and
unawares steals down on the merry knot sitting in the great chamber, who
beholding the little Senate of petty Nymphs and Damsels, bit the lip in
conceit, but by your leave changed countenance: for such was Venus presence,
that always moved Jove's patience: yet because his changing should be perceived
of none, he entered a withdrawing Chamber by, not perceived of any, calling in
all the have to Ganymede: and ye rest of the Nymphs being earnest in their
discoursings, gave little attendance to Jupiters intercourse, so that he passed
by them into the chamber before he was seen or heard of any, but when the Boy
had once heard the voice of his Lord, it was no time to will him hye ore the
lappes of his Ladies, but as if Aeolus drove him with the blast of his breath:
so lightly forsook he his company and his bench.

Jupiter his page no sooner entered his presence, but began in these terms to
salute his petty person. Sir wagge (said he) you are amidde the women when you
should attend my will, beholding others braueries, but neglecting my business:
I beseech you Sir, what Nymph was she that attended your right hand while I
passed by the left.

Ganymede remembering it was Venus, and accordinglye, infourmed his Lord,
reporting her to be an attendant on Dyctymia. Venus (answered Jupiter) have we
been two days seeking Venus in the Capital, you having stolen her out to
sport with you in the great Chamber? I thought (said he) her some rare
personage being adorned with so rare perfections. Hye you therefore to the
Senate, and tell the Gods (for this day) I adiorne the Session: Ganymede as was
his Lordinges message, hasted him to the Capital to inform the^ his masters
mind: upon the hearing whereof, all the house rose seeking no further reason.

By this the Debyan God had discharged his fierye courses, betaking him to the
bower of his beloved Thetis, it was no time for Nymphs to chat of love, when
their Mistress to stop their mouths, had abridged the^ of their leisure: they
moreover poor souls so weary of their late nights ouer-watching, are so
drowned in sleep, that there is not one waking: and for my part I so greatly
tender a woman's ease, that rather then I would wake them, I will refuse mine
art: a sweet smyling kiss of a Ladies sleepye lip, I account far greater
treasure then a largis at a mighty Emperors hand: rest you therefore (sweet
loves) secure, void of troubled thoughts, while I trouble others to conjecture
of your sugared minds.

NOw was it time when Cynthia forsaking her silver Orb, had left the whole
Zoane unto Apollos charge giving leave to Zephirus to provide for Aeolus
passage: the Nymphs now risen attend their Ladies call, and hasten forwards
for their mistress quick dispatch: short tale to make, each entered the
Capital, earnestly expect the coming of their King: I will here repeat the
accidents happened with mighty Jupiter, if any can entreat Ganymede, I dare
warrant my life he shall hear of much prittie sport: the boy and his Lord long
ere this are supposed lost, and Gods grant it my fortune to pronounce them
happy found.

Saturnus soon after diverse sportings with ye Paphlogoman youth his Page, now
minds ye Senate, and is entered the presence: whether no sooner come, but
narowly he pryeth to have a sight of his new sweet heart Venus: what need I
here to note Jupiters love, wherein none are ignorant, acquainted with his
life, his close courtings, glorious glaunces, and prittie practices: I rather
leave them to others, whose studies have made them famyliar with his factions,
then undertake the charge too chargeable for my fortunes: his trewanting from
Olimpus, when more meeter he had been in the heavens: and metamorphoses of
shapes, because he would not be known on earth: all these are better descryed
by the prying of Juno, then the penning of a nouice such as I, whose ears have
never yet made me privy of such experience, nor whose experience ever attained
such priuities: but thus suppose, that if ever he loved any, he loved Venus,
and Venus more then any: if ever he desired any he desired Venus, and my Venus
desired he before any: if ever he metamorphosed himself for any, he
metamorphosed himself for Venus, and for Venus was he more strangely
metamorphosed the^ for any: if he fained him self Aethra to obtain Calisto, now
sought he a more maidenly shape the^ Aethraes to be conversant with my Venus:
if in habit of Dyane he deceived ye Nymph Nonacris, what shape sought he the^
think you to deceive even Phaebe her self? he entertained not so many golden
Actions, when he begat the famous Porsey, as he did the golden thougts at the
view of his exceeding Venus.

I dare not hold him long thus doting on his Goddess, least wanting in the
Senate, I encurre the hatred of the Gods and exercising Pentheyes contempt: I
endure Pentheyes punishment. He passes on now to parliament expected of his
Peers, and my crew are now clustred entending their purpose: Ganymede hastes
Venus to undertake her promised charge, and gives charge to the Ladies none
interrupt Venus heste. And now being silent, the royal crew of Carthage, the
Ilyan stranger greeteth Dydo after this semblaunce.

Lycurgus (said Venus) the Lacidimonians law giver, had never lived renowned
in Greece, had not his laws observed, maintained the state of Greece, and him
self in Greece framed his life corresponde^t to his laws, the law maker must
be no Law breaker: and he that governs others, is then more wise, when
rightlye he orders himself: infamous is that bird, that perverting the law
of nature (as says the old adage) defiles her own nest: what Pallamides had
driven Ulysses from Greece, had not Tellemacus care revealed his Fathers
curse: and what Ganymede compelled Venus to display her imbecilities, had not
Venus own sentence pronounced her repented follies. Pardon me Ladies and
Ganymede excuse thy Venus, unwilling though I am to enter these unacquainted
actions: the Painter feathereth not the Shafte, ne the Fletcher handles not
the Pencell: who sets the Ass to the Hare, or the Puttocke to the
Partridge: The stock of Grapegraftors tell me, suteth not with the syence of
the Medlar: nor is the stalk of a Thorn natural for the graffe of a Pippin:
the Gillyflower twice set, grows double by art, when simply sown, she
springs single by nature: long is it or the Mastie be taught to retriue the
Partridge, or the Hound of the Kitchen, to maintain chase after the Hare.

I shall but deceive you (sweet Nymphs) that expect matters of strange compare
from Venus, when strange it is any matter at all should distill the wits of
Venus: if you would Ulysses wit, search Homers tomes: if Aeneas valiant acts,
read learned Maroes Aeneads: Galen shall give his goods, Justinian honors, and
love who seeks, let him search the ancient house of proud Halyan sulmo.

But I hear these Ladies say that Venus prescribed an edict, but will you tie
me to necessity? the^ is your law (Ladies) without law, because grounded on
necessity: yet hearken fair Nymphs, Venus shall not be coye without a cause:
nor having cause, contend to be curious: if you have vouchsafed of courtesy to
undertake Venus motions, Venus for your sake shall strain all her veins,
either for an appologie, or an apostacy.

Ganymede must be courted say you, and Venus says Ganymede, and none other
must court him: shall I injury Ganymede of his love, or these Ladies of their
praises? no, Ganymede shall participate of my love, but to satisfy his list
and these Ladies, my reasons be it to yield them their rights.

Oh how well spoke Cyane, (Ganymede) in praise of thy beauty, and how eloquent
Dorys in commendations of thy wit: the first an argument of great force in
Ladies minds, the latter a rare spectacie in women's manners: both these so
excellent, concluding their arguments, that shame will it be to me in showing
my art.

Shall I like Apelles boy seeking to mend the Nose, mare the Face: or the
foolish Fletcher exceeding my bounds, deface the form of my bolt: O how rude
shall Venus reasons seem, among those propositions of Dorys and Cyane, yea
Cyanes beauty ( Venus will imblasen thy deformetie: and Dorys wit, discover thy
follies.

Yet Nymphs and sweet Ganymede, pardon me, and regard my necessity: if
Venus wantonly wander it is but for necessity: if she digress, necessity: if
she err necessity: whatsoever Venus does, none does excuse her, and accuse
necessity: but such burden pleases these Nymphs to oppose on Venus.
Ganymedes beautye I both admire and love, and cannot indeed indifferently
praise it, his wit, I reverence and adore: and cannot rightly commend it, all
things in Ganymede excelling Venus skill: and Venus skill too base to undertake
Ganymedes bravery, unless some Dorys or Cyane vouchsafe him their censures.
But Venus must speak, and what speaks Venus (Ladies) but your praises? whose
wit so rare in defining Ganymede, have edified you, and eternized Ganymede.

Had Bellerophon left labor after conquest of the Chymery, or left him quiet
after conquest of the Solynye: Perseus Palfreye had not been his poison, ne
the exercising Pelagus lines prised so dear, as with the loss of Bellerophons
life. Ah me unhappy Venus, that necessity being void of law, should tie me
to the performaunce of a law: and soaring beyond my point, fall to my utter
perdition.

If I love Ganimede, I must praise Ganimede: if I praise Ganimede, then for his
perfection must I praise Ganimede: perfecter may Ganymede then beautye can make
him, what is then left Venus (unhappy Venus) wherein Ganymede to praise thee,
when Dorys and Cyane have in all parts so brauelye emblazoned thy praises?

In all things there is but good, and bad: right, and wrong: little, or great:
but bethink thee Venus. Aristotle as said Cyane, treating de principiis,
declares them three: and Tullye de locis deliberatinis, other three: honestum,
vtile and possibile: under vtile (Ganimede) I conteyne thy beauty, honestum thy
wit: but whither will thou wander Venus, for thy possibile? Aristotle says in
his Ethics, that in all things diuisible, there is something more, something
less, something equal: more or less, what can there be then beauty and wit?
or of greater equality?

But Marcus speaks of a mediocratie, and that will he have his virtue.

Well found indeed Venus, thy virtue Ganimede bears away the bell, thy beauty
either with the Summers Sun is scorched, or the Winters storm blasted: thy
wit, age weakeneth, or sickness preiudiceth: thy virtue (Ganimede) neither the
force of Phoebus parching rays can enter, nor Brumaies foggie moisture
attainte: which like the Cedars in Etla never rot, or the Daphnean Laurel
never wither: keeps with the pure Cyuet his sweet favor, and the tried
Adamant, his perpetual hardness.

What makes men on the earth famous, in their graves glorious, in the heavens
immortal? but virtue. This made Caesar a mighty Emperor on earth, honored
for a God in heaven, eternized Scipio for a Saint, and that inuinsible alsydes
worthily woorshiped under title of an heavenly Heroes.

Glad am I Ganimede although occurrent with these Nymphs, I yet find some
argument at the least something discrepant from these Nymphs wherein I
confess I shall but auere your reasons (Ladies) though exercise mine own wits:
wit said I, too mean (fair Sisters) to be inserted in your disputations, and
too base metal Ganimede, to incorporate with thy divine matter: whose
natural proclinitie approves my disputation unnatural Sophistry: yet
Ganymede is my love, nothing less then these my Sisters, though my beauty be
inferior, my desire is as great: though my wit be so green, all that I can
say is virtue the handmayden of the Gods, and sole mistress of men: virtue
(Ganymede) which beautifieth thy beauty, and covers thy rare wit to an
absolute wisdom, directs thy course in this life, adopting it to be a
further life.

What, shall I show thee the necessity heerof to th'attaining the summum bonum
of Cicero, or the absolute pathway to the felicity of Aristotle: all these are
better known by the writings of learned men, then the assertions of an
effeminate woman: better taught the ignorant by experience, then the learned by
reading: so amply every way, that I cannot with indifferency commend it any
way, for if he have known any thing: who can conceal this from Ganymede? if
he have read any thing, what is after viewed by Ganymede?

By this I hope Ganymede conceiving good opinion of my love, will yield me for
a favor, one iotte of good lyking: and though I cannot challenge nothing by
deserte, yet bestow one favor of Venus of alms: which if Ganymede of favor,
and these Nymphs of pity shall grant: Venus, will do homage to these
Nymphs, and report Ganymede only gracious. but,

Yea but (said Ganymede) and none but Venus has hit the butte and the white:
Clymen shall keep her reasons close.

And for that close (said Clymen) I bequeathe Ganymede content, thanks and
prayers to Ganymede, that so prudent has discharged the disgrace of Clymen.

No disgrace Clymen, said Ganymede, but a dismission, knowing your
sufficiency such, as better can answer learned arguments, and easier argue in
greater exercises. As for this task, I think it so fullye performed, that
attend these Nymphs my sentence: only Venus caries away my censures.

If any thing in this my judgment more then reason, or less then wit,
displease these pleasing Goddesses: I fly no farther for favor then the
lymits of your fancyes, whose urgent opportunity, have offered this tha^klesse
opportunity: but sithence you have annexed to my love a lotte: making my
words oracles, and my saying a sentence: I will with one lyppe you pronounce
Venus my love, striving no farther for maistrie, but accept her for mistesse:
here with so sweet consent possessed these Ladies contents, that with full
voice they cried all Venus, Venus, Venus.

Now rowsed horned Hamon from his Chair of state, and at the name of Venus all
the Senate stood, thinking the late exiled aduldresse had aproched mauger
their deities, to exhybite her appeal: the caster of the fearful lightnings,
storms, and thundereth deadly inward sighs, and threats as if Lycaon were to
sustain new sentence for his sin: or the earth bread his thundenboltes in
revenge of their boldenes: the very sight amazed the Senate that saw him carry
terror in his brows, a secret silence passed through the house, and Jove that
storming expected strange news remembers now Ganymedes exercise, and Venus
name.

Now has Jupiter peace in his heart, mirth in his countenanre, love in his
mind: the Gods smyle to see their king so pleasant, and the whole sinode as it
were sung for joy to behold him so merrye: he beckeneth forthwith to the
lovely Son Maya, sending him into the great Chamber with this message, that
Ganymede should present him with his Venus to quiet his mind, and the others
variaunce.

The Gods which yet knew not Jupiters mind, looked strangelye on Jupiters
message: but hearing Iou^ treat of a conclusion to their variance, they were
all willing to welcome Ganymedes Venus: thus being earnest fixed the eyes of
every person: Ganymede after this manner brings in his present.

First entered Hermes with a statelye pace, as if he manned Bryseis to her
Virgins bowers: then issued on the gallant Ganymede, a Laurel wreathe within
one hand, his love fast by the other: then all the Nymphs her fellows within
whose hands sweet Olive palms they bear, as if they then attend Dyana to
chase, walking along the sweet Thessalyan Playnes: or else the Muses travailing
Hellicon, when they met the adulterous Thracian Fyrew.

How might I hear depainte Venus praise, or declare the delight taken in her
presence, such as have felt the full excess of joy shall decide this doubt,
whom I make my Judges.

Jupiter commaundes his Page to declare the order of their pastime: and
controuled their vanities, that made such outcrye on Venus.

Ganymede describes his Lord the whole circumstance of their jesting, and
said Venus virtue had merited a judgment, desiring the whole house if he had
made a sin, without further pause to revoke his passed sentence.

What should I write here the wonder of the Gods and Goddesses gathering by
Ganymedes talk such hope of Venus graces: I refer you to the sequel, how
regarding her absolute virtues the whole house pro^^^^ced a second sentence,
redoubling Venus, Venus, V^^^^ The ruler of the Welkin secretlye triumphs to
see his purpose sort of good effect: commanding Latona and his wedded Sister
t'aduaunce the Nymphe, into the exiles throne, calling for the box of sacred
Oil, wherewith he annointes the Lady Queen of love: and having placed the
diadem on her head: gives her three blessings with his holy hand, and as his
fingers compassed her temples, so his lips at every bless uttered these
tunes, viuat Venus, viuat Venus, viuat Venus.

Now is the house dismissed, the Parliament ended, and for I dare not meddle
with the order of Venus enstalement: I will write you something of their
progress from the Parliament, such as the shortness of my wit will suffer, or
slendernes of my pen permit.

TRyton with his Trumpet sounds a retreit, proceeding in a manner a sollempne
march: next Mercurye, who on his shoulders bore a golden mace enchased with
glorious Pearl: then Venus, my Venus on whose right hand did attend fair
Ganymede, and love- Cupid led her by the other, whose train the chaste Dyana
scorned not to bear: then Jove was next with Juno in his hand, Apollo then
with Pallas arm in arm, Berecynthia, Mars, Neptune, Vulcan and the rest, in
seemly order marched two and two: so did the Nymphs attendants on the train.

And I that sitting, mused at this divine and holy train: and when all were
gone and past, arose and departed, and vowed ever to honor Venus.

FINIS.
Deficiliaque Pulchra.
