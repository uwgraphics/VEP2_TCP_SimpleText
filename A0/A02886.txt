The Preface.
EVydent is yt (dear frynde in the Lord) unto them which are in the scripturs
exercysed / that our eternal God for his own ^^lye honor created man at the
first / and all other creaturs for mannys behoue. This ones conceived by faith
in Abell and Enos / at the preachynges of Adam and Seth for the first age /
provoked the one to offer up sacrifice unto hi / and the other to call upon his
most gloryouse name. In this godly office was Noe found ryghtouse / Abraham
says full / Moses mighty / David holy / Helias fervent / and many other
more in their sorts zelouse for all the other ages. Far to long were yt and
tedyouse unto the readers to recyte the examples of all the fathers in that
behalf. Jesus Christ the only fulfyller of all ryghtousnesse / in all his
sore trauay le here / sought the only glory of his heaue^lye father / and
taught the same lesson above all other to be observed of his. In the manyfolde
temptacions of satan in the wilderness he pacie^tlye answered to that was
suggested / but the presumed dishonor of God in no case could he suffer. The
holy Apostles and many other Godly mynysters / have evermore daungered their
syues in the lust quarrel of the same. If we than wetyngly should suffer him in
this age to be blasphemed / all these godly examples rejected / we might
thereby rather apere his enemies / than servants / his haters than lovers.
This consyderacion first moved my mind / after that I had seane a three years
ago / an abhomynable Jest made under the tyttle of a Genealogye of heresye /
and by two diverse prentes spread abroad among the people / to dysclose the
great mysterye of iniquyte thervndre contained / and to restore again the
perverted scripturs / with the names of those Godly men which are oblocuted
therein. In this will no man that is godly be offended / but think that I have
herin done my bound duty. Though the compylet thereof by the merciful
Goodness of God be converted to repentance (as I am credyblye infourmed that
he is) yet remains his blasphemouse doctrine among the common people in a
wonderful nombre of coppyes. I thought yt therefore mete / not utterly to
destroy my labors / but for the abolyshment of those wicked blasphemies to
suffer them pass at large. yet I instauntlye desire the readers of my book /
not to think any thing therein spoken against him / which is now becommen
Gods servant / but against that old pestysent Papyst Pantolabus which still
yet blasphemeth Christ and his most faithful witnesses. Him would I not have
them to space / so long as he dwesseth on the earth / and that is that
prodygyouse Jest or Generacyon of heresye. Unseemly were yt / so many sweet
scripturs to remain so depraved / and so many Godly men so slaunderouslye
reported / the veryte in them both so spyghtfullye abused / for his names sake
which has wrought wyckedlye. Though Adam recanted his error / and David his
wicked workinges / Peter his denial of Christ / and Paul his tyrannouse
turmoylynges / yet are they not hydden in the scripturs / but made fiyll open
to all the world / in re^uke and warninge unto us of soche execrable euyls.
Never y^ less yet those vices so rebuked / are now unto them no rebuke / but a
syngular praise rather where as they are rehearsed / beige wholle remitted in
Christ. The great sin of Adam which is the only ground of death in all me^
is yet every year proclaimed happy / among the Paschall ceremonies. Wha^
Christ leans his church unrebuked and vntrobled forsynne / than rouneth she
a straye by many s^r^unge and uncommanded worshyppinges. Than reygneth she
commo^lye in a wicked peace / and abhominablye plays the whore abusing her
self in the cowche of Iesabel. Apoca. 2. as of long time has done the
Romyshe Synagoge. And so becomes she no longer his chosen spouse / but a
reproved congregation. Much more honor is ours / when our sins are rebuked
by the scripturs / than when the scripturs remain by us reproved and
slaundered. Among the profane Philosophers and Poets / was ever the verite
had in honor / and preferred far above all fleshlye amyte. Much more than
ought it so to be used among us which are of the Christian scole. The rebukes
of this book / wayeth upon the matter and not the man / the spyghtfull
blasphemer and not the godly recanter. That his filthy vomete is proved here
abhomynacion by the scripturs / to the intent that people should detest it and
not therewith be poysened / can be unto his name no derogacion but rather a
lawde among them that are godly wise. Very vncomlye were it / that
fylthynesse should have fauer / and so be cowche^ up as a precyouse treasure /
among men of Christen honest. Rather is it mete / that it were thrown
fourth / and so manifesilye known for that it is / even very fylthynesse in
deed. I have no doubt thereof / but. I. ^. becomminge the servant of God
utterly now detesteth that foul Papyst Pantolabus that Romyshe rybalde /
that ryotouse rayser with all his prodigiouse Poesyes and would have him rather
bayted away with botchers dogs / than any longar to wait upon him. Full
glad are we to hear it / that from Sodom he is lately departed / leauige that
beast there behind him to receive the lords double plage / and that his self
now trauayleth (I trust) toward the mount of sauegarde. That he is becomen
of a wolf a lamb / of a Saul a Paul / and of a spyghtfull persecuter a
godly Christen preacher / it is unto us no small rejoice. We lawde that
heavenly lord / which thus of mere pytie and mercy has found out his
almost peryshed sheep / laid him upon his shulders / and brought him again to
his fold. If he still persevere according to his calling. Heshall become of a
forener a cytezen with the Saints / and a glouryouse partyner with Christ in
his eternal heritage. He shall also have for his lust labors in the lords
vyneyarde here / besides his penye wages his peculyar praise in the sanctyfyed
congregacyon of the ryghtouse. The eternal father and lord Jesus Christ indue
so with his sprete both him and us / that we may unto the end persevere
faithful / to the counfort of his electes. Amen.

A mysterye.
1 The Genealogye of heresye. 2 Compyled by Ponce Pantolabus
The openinge.
O Therwyse can I not coni^cture of Pantolabus / but that he has put forth
these preciouse poesyes of some set purpose / either to be seane a famous
poet / or else to apere a mighty vpholder of the Popes holy church. But if
he thinks herin to have mynistered unto his native region of England a
doctrine of christen religion / he wonderfullye deceyueth himself. What they
will some to be by the towche stone of Gods word / the sequel of this book
shall declare. I think no^ other than the very doctrine of deuyls / y^ lies
of a popyshe hypocrite / the errors of a cruel Antichrist / the filthy
drink of the whores cup of Babylon / and the stinkynge fruits of the
bo^tomlesse pytt. Expende first of all the tyttle of his tragedye / which is /
the Genealogye of heresye / and ye shall find in yt small goodness I suppose.
Saint Paul ernestlye admonished his derelye beloved disciples Tymothe and
Tytus in any wise to shurne Genealogyes and fables as things most
super^luouse and vain.

2 Panotlabus as one of a contrary sprete and judgment has not only taken
this for bydden office upon him / but also used yt here in a much worse kind.
For there is yt spoken concerning. Iudaysme or vnnecessarye doubts in Moses
law. Here does he usurp yt in blasphemouse raylinges and unshamefast lies
against them whose lives were most innocent and godly. He shows himself
therefore in this not only a spyghtfull aduersarye unto Paul's lerning / but
also a cruel enemy both to Christ and his king / mynistrynge unto that
people soche doctrine of deuilyshnesse / of whom the one is the head the other
his depute / in that he is under him a christen governor. Of this vnwholsom
tyttle is yt easy to judge / what the fruits are thereupon following. Let the
Reader therefore mark them / and beware of those false Apostles which bring
them soche messages of myschefe. The Genealogye of Pantalabus now follows in
course.

A mysterye.
1 Blind obstynacye. 2 Begat heresye. 3 By a myschaunce 4 Of dame ignorance.
Malicia eorum excecauit eos. Sap. 2.
The openinge.
A Monstruouse beginning has this Genealogye declarynge at the first flushe
both the mo^struouse heart of the author / and also the monstruouse nature of
that malignaunt church of Anticrist / of whom he is a professed membre. Non
other fruit can the ill tree render / I se well / than his own froward nature
permits hi. For naught is yt not that many excellent writers in discribinge
Anticristis kyngedome / has called yt a false / filthy / fleshlye / whoryshe
/ preposterous / prostybulouse / promiscuouse / and abominable generation.
Here is the child said to begett his father / or the sons child his
grandefather / and all in y^ femynine gendre. Wherefore yt is like to be a
strange hindered by that time that it be al brought forth. For here is blind
obstinacy reported to beget heresye / and yet was heresye many years in the
world before him. Non ca^be obstynate in error before he does err / nor
wilfullye resyst y^ verite before he does hate it.

2 Rather should heresye therefore seem to bring forth obstinacye / than
obstinacye to engendre heresye. For after the vocabulystes Tortellius / Valla /
Perottus / Polycattus / Crestonus / Calepinus / Guarinus / and soche other
vocabulystes: heresis / is not else but a choice / opinion / or sect. Not much
unlike unto this does Saint Luke use yt in the acts / and Saint Paul also
declaringe himself there a pharyse. Be it ones cowpled withean obstinate
frowardness or a wylfull resistaunce of the open verite / no longar is it an
heresye / but an obstinacye / rebellion / or diuisyon. Thus does the scripture
call the adversaries of Gods truth ^on heretics / but false prophets /
sewde apostles / deceitful teachers / and Anticristes. Therefore goes
Pantolabus vnlernedlye to work in his Generation of heresye. Rather should he
have bego^ne at the denyll which first begat darkness / and so have gone
forth from darkness to ignorance / and from ignorance to error / with his
brethren in the captivity of Babylon. Or else from Anticrist to avarice from
avarice to symonye / and from symonye to heresye in that vein. And in so
doing / he might at the las^ have found out his own stinkynge sodomitycall
generation.

3 If this course had not pleased him for y^ obseruacion of his meters /
because he is a poet lorrel / he might have taken this way with him. The
false generation. Of the popish nation. Begone by the devil. The grounder of
evil. Of envy and hate. The devil first begat / The subtyle serpent / Or
worm pestilent The serpent by Cayne / Got the kyndered vain / Of brethren
untrue / That gods servants slew. And so forth with the carnal children of
(...) / with Cham / Nem roth / the Sodomites / Ismael / Esau / Pharao /
Manasses / Antiochus / Phassur / the pres^es of Baall and of Bell. Herod /
Cayphas / Judas / Simon magus / Bariehu / Diotrephes / with their successors
the Pope and his college of cardinals / with his smered swarm of shauelynges
both pylled and pie pecked. But this sort he cowde not find out / his eye
sight is so ill on that side. If blind obstinacte were not his father I
maruele / so much light of the veryte being a broad and heretayninge so
little. I dare boldelye say he was his leader and his great prouoker ^oha^ he
made this work. I think al discrete readers will have y^ same opinion of him
in that point that I have here. Iugde tha^ whether he be out of his own
Genealogye or nay.

4 Dame ignorance whom he here verefyeth to be y^ mother of heresye / should
seem to have a great stroke in him / all circu^stau^ces marked / to make up the
generation toward him. The myschaunce whereof / though it be not perseyued of
him for wa^te of grace / yet is it known unto us by the fruits here. For never
had we known what Pantolabusis / had not these poesyes declared him. All
contrary is he in opynion to the ancient doctors / if he thinks that the
old heretics were ignorant and unlearned. Saint Hierome reports of
Tacianus / that he famouslye taught the art of rhetoryck / and that he also
wrote innumerable works. Marcellus was exceeding wittye / and Sabinus was
naturallye eloquent. Basilides compiled more than. xxiiii. volumes upon the
scripturs. What Justinius says of Marcion / Hireneus of Montanus / Tertulyane
of Valentinus / Cypriane of Nouatus / Saint Augustine of Donatus Faustus and
Felix. Saint Cyryst of Nestorius / Pelagius / and Eunomius and other doctors of
Arrius / Eutices / Fotinus / and soche other it were ve ^ye much to write. And
as concerning Wyclef / Husse / Luther / Melanchton / and their felawes here
regestred / it shall here after apere what they were. So that it shall well be
known that dame ignorance keeps house rather with Pantolabus and with other
of his f^llawes more in papistrye / than with them or with soche as they be in
their sort.

5 The text that he boroweth here of Sapience / Masicia little exce^auit / is as
insypientlye bestowed / as it had been in the hand lynge of a most insipient
all. The wise man speaks it of them which cruellye oppresses the rightouse
for rebukinge their evils / taking for their auctoryte the laws of
vnrightousnesse. And of soche as examineth them with spyghtfull rebukes and
torments / so conde^pninge them to most shameful death. Their malice (says
he) has blinded them. So that it perteyneth whole to the blodye generation of
anticrist. Behold therefore the blind understanding of this papist / how he
gives it to blind obstinacye / therewith to begett heresye of ignorance.
Think ye not this scripture well handeled? yes / and the devil of hell should
have had the handelynge of it. yet is he no^ heretyque among the bysshoppes /
nor his book found evil / but put forth by the kings pryuilege as a
necessary doctrine of their holy church. O England England / miserablye
plaged artthou to have soche leaders. Pray to the eternal God to better it /
and repent thy vntha^kefulnesse past / least thou perisshe with the wicked.
Mark that follows in the next clause of the same Chapter of Sapience. Etne
scie^unt sacramenta Dei etc. And ye shall find there that they which should be
your instructers / understands not the misteryes of God. They neither hope
for the reward of tightousnesse / nor yet regard y^ worship that the saints
shall possess.

A mysterye.
1 Herefye begat. 2 Strife and debate. 3 Debate and ambycyon. 4 Begat
supersticyon. 5 Odium suscitat rixas. Proverb. 10.
The openinge. 1.
BOldelye passes forth this blind poet with his prodigyouse poesyes / to non
other end but to seduce the simple. Needs will he have heresye the father to
strife and debate. And I am not against it in that unlearned kind that he
takes it in without the auctoryte of all good authors. But than I would not
have him to forget that heresye also begat y^ Popes power / with purgatory /
perdones / and pylgrymages. He begat popish presthode also of dame
deuylyshnesse to sing. Masses at callettes heles for all christmas hooles. For
sowles they may^ well destroy / as they daily do innumerable / but non can
they save by there Masses. If their heresye has not begotten all abhominacions
of Idolatrye in Images / rodes / and rellyques / shrines / sorceryes / and
subtyl^ees / besides their bastardes a broad / whose heresye has done it? If
their he resye begat not the gapinge rode of boxleye / the duckes blood of
hayles / the worm ^aten lady of walsyngham / holy Thomas Becket the trayter
with a thousand soche other / besides their holy occupie^ge in Sodom and
Gomorre / many men are sore deceyned.

2 And as concerning strife and debate / who has engendered more myschefe
therein tha^ they? which to bring their purposes to pass / has subverted so
many lands / destroyed so many dominions / subdewed so many emprours and
kings / besides their poysoninges / puttinge out of eyes / and shaninge the
right inheritours into monkeryes / sumtyme y^ father sumtyme the son /
sumtyme y^ dowter / sumtyme the mother / for non have they spared in their
furyes. yea / within the realm of England who cawsed king herolde to be
slain / king Johan to be poysened / king Richard the second to be famished
/ and in a manner all other kings to be vexed of their commons but they? was
Jack Srawe and Wat Tyler with soche other scysmatyckes / and now in owr days
master Ask and captain Cobbler / raised by any other than by their oyled
owlyshe generacio^? No truly. For if they were / the kings laws has done
them wrong / to hang up so many in rochettes / whodes / cowles / and
typpettes / so small reverence had to their vnccions and shauinges.

3 This seems Pantolabus to conferme in the next time folowinge / though he
does not so utter it. Debate / (says he) and ambicio^ begat supersticion. And
he tells the truth of it / though it be sumwhat vnlernedlye for lack of
godly judgment. For in deed after the papists had by there manifold s^ysmes
and diuisyons ones gotten the over hands of princes and worldly gouerners by
a title of spiritualte / so crepinge into the weak consciences of men. They
began anon after ambyciouslye to regne. Not only there exaltyng themselves a
boue God / and their own stynkinge traditions above his eternal verite / but
also they outwardlye auaunced themselves by a mundy all Monarchy of pride /
Pomp / and vain glory. Than mustred they in their myters / they sailed in
their sylkes / they glyttred i^ their goldes / ruffled i^ there rochettes /
flickered in their furs / and ratled in there rings.

4 And to mainteyne that lucyferouse estate of spiritual wickedness in the
stead of heavenly things / as Saint Paul does call it / that they might
sogloriouslye govern here in darkness / they invented all kinds of
supersticions in blessings / bones / belles / candelstyckes / cups /
cruettes / oil / wax / light / ashes / palms / and holy water / with soche
other like. They dedicated stone walls / they cristened belles / they
consecrated vestime^tes they ano^ted chalyces / they hallowed aulters they
tabernacled Images / they shryned dead men's bones / they coniured / crossed /
sensed / spatled / and breathed / with turn and half turn / and with seyst
me and seyst me not / and a thousand feats more of clean legerde main / to
uphold that mart of their maintenance. And therefore he says well here that
ambicyon begat supersticion / if it had been so truly applied. For bysshoppes
/ monks / and prestes / has brought forth all these spiritual fruits.

5 But where as he allegeth this text out of Salomons Proverbs / Odium
suscitatrix as / to prove that heresye begat strife and debate / he shows
himself no very wise interpretour of the scripturs. But that he thought
parauenture than / he might of the^ make a welche man's hole / having his
lord of Wynchestire upon his side. Who can accuse him for an heretyque if the
Bysshoppes say nay to it? though he plays the devil with the scripturs of
god. It is their office never to po^nisshe them that peruerteth Gods word /
but to burn them always that truly preaches it. Solomon says there / that
hate engenders brawlynges or scysmes / and not that heresye begat strife. And
that is spoken there of your ungodly generation / if you be they that are
Idell work men and have sluggyshe hands / oppressers of the poor and
norryshers of sin / as all the world knows that ye are / having unshame
fast faces and presumptuouse mouths. I matuele ye could not find there. Qut
profert contumeliam insipiens est / he that speaks any slaundre is a fool.
Surely dame ignorance threw her napkyn before your eyes when ye read that
chapter. But take heed of it and ye will ye are promised there that the thing
ye are most a frayde of shall come upon you. yowr hope shall perish / and yowr
years shall be shortened. For the wickedness of Samariu is come to light.

CVryouslye still countereth this chaunter of babylon with his mangye ma^gled
meters. For here one of the^ halteth on y^ one side like a greye / being a
syllabe shorter than his fellawe. It is no maruele therefore though his name be
slowthe / for in deed he comes but slowlye after. Supersticion (ye say
begat disdain. And it may welebe: for rather are his fruits before rehearsed
of disdain / than of love / of hate than of fauer / of malice than of pity.
And in deed the scripture says they are mockers and scorners / deridinge the
verite / and withs^andinge the health of the people. But surely supersticion
has more children tha^ disdain / if Pantolabus look well abought him.
Hypocresye which brought forth latten hours / long prayers without devotion
/ letanies / frydaye fastinges / owr ladies psalters / monks / chano^s /
fryres / nonnes / ankers / hermites / bedes / portasses / diurnals / tapers /
torches / wepiges / crowchinges / knelynges / gaddinges / and soche other
beggeryes else / should seem to be one of them. So should blasphemye also with all
his abominable of spring.

2 What disdain this should be / he declares folowinglye / calling it
disdain of truth and the father of slouthe. This contempt of godliness and
verite sprange up first in Cain and increased in the carnal children of me^ne.
And though it were in process of time destroyed in the general flood / yet
rose it up again after the days of No^ in Cham / and so grew forth still in
Nemroth / Ismael / and in their wicked sede. After this had it continuance in
the false prophets and Idolatrouse prestes of Baal / in the Pharysees /
Scribes / Bisshoppes and heretyques / till the pope took hold of it. Ever sens
has it been gloryouslye mainteyned of his anointed clergy / with churches /
minsters / monasteryes / couentes / cloisters / colleges / vniuersytees /
princes laws / sword fire / and halter. Which gloriouse habytacions has
pampred up fatt foggye monks / proud porkyshe prestes / great bellyed
bysshoppes / as brockyshe bores in a swynes fly / in all bodylye ease of
slothful sluggyshnesse / Idelnesse / lechery / and beasilynesse / there
wallowynge in Sodom and Gomorre. But truly I think it a great ouersyght of
Pantolabus / that he here forgate scolasticall divinity / which made the Pope
Gods vicar / the head of the church and the keye berer of purgatory to let
out and in at his pleasure / for it has also risen of disdain of the truth.

3 Of a lykelyhode wylfulnesse had.ii. fathers / not all unlike to bishops
bastardes / and to the popish prestes children^ Which has one father that
bears the name / and an other that took pains to begett him. For here are
slouthe and slughyshnesse both named to be his fathers. But doubtless the
right hayres are not here remembered / nor yet they that still occupye their
lands. And that are all puffed up prelates / with persons / vicars / and
curates. And hardelye let not sir hugh holy water swynger be forgotten among
the^. The throwinge a side of the sacred scripturs / and the false deceyuinge
of the poor laboringe manne / should seem also to be twigs of the same
branch and sprayes of the same sprygge / yea and to be sumwhat before
wylfulnesse in this generation. And therefore Pantolabus is but a ^ole / and
follows to much the counsel of dame ignorance in the descripcio^ of this
Genealogy / or else he is a parciall frinde to wylfulnesse. And I think that
be the very cause in deed. This sure hold also he has upon his side / that
painters / poets / and Rome to^ners may lie by auciorite.

4 The text which he has torn out of Salomons proverbs / vult et non vult
piger / proves nothing to the purpose that sluggishnesse and slouthe begat
wylfulnesse. More honest were it for him that dame ignorance were farther of
from his elbowe / when he shall set his hands to the scripturs. Satan in y^
desert never bestowed Angelis suis Deus man dauit dete more vnclarkelye / than
this text is here bestowed. Salomons mind is / that y^ sluggarde would feign
have / but it comes not so unto him / where as the diligent labourer is
habundauntlye suffysed. For thus stands y^ text after the truer translacion.
Concupiscit anima pigri / et non est ei quod optat. But as the sainge is / the
full fed sow seeks mire / the vile vermin corrupcion / as Pantolabus has
done here the corrupt translacion for his purpose. And yet will it not serve
for slouthe to beget wilfulness / though he turn it.xxiiii. ways / as fryre
martyn ded his desardes heart Wonderfullye now a days are the scripturs
handeled in England / yet are there non heretyques on that side of the way.
For how can a papist be an heretyque to his hinderaunce / when papists wear
still myters and robes. It follows in the same chapter. Astutus omnia agir cum
consilio / qui autem factuus est / aperit stulticiam. A wise manne does all
with discressio^ but a fool declares his folly. But this could not Pantolabus
find out / with other godly counsels there me^cioned. Wherefore his part here
after is like to be sumwhat y^ worse.

A mysterye.

The openinge. 1.
Diversely does this popish poet resemble himself / always as blind as a
byttle / and wotteth not well which way to wandre. yet will he still forewarde
with his pedlarie wares Wilfulness he says (who^ he has preferred here in
his Genealogye to his other brethern / I am sure for some old familyar
acquayntaunce) being nigh cosyne to heresye / begat mischefe. It should seem
here unto me / that Pantolabus is not very well seane in genealogyes / or else
he daunseth with Jack of Bedlem a voluntarye round or a galearde at his
pleasure. For here he calls heresye cosyne to wylfulnesse / and yet he is.vi.
degrees before him. yea / and to make his own asynishe rudeness more manifest
therein / he calls him here his nigh cosyne. Truly this is to folyshe to have
yt scripturs coupled with it / if Boner and Wynchestre with other holy
fathers wynke not upon it wha^ they honte for heretyques. But parauenture he
does it here that wylfulnesse should be known to be all one with heresye / or
else to make good his purpose folowinge / as to prove Joan Wyclef an heretyque.
But as the Prophet says / he that prepares a snare for an other / most
co^monlye falls into it his self / as Pantolabus has done here / if the
abominable peruertige of Gods word be a kind thereof.

2 He says that wylfulnesse begat mischefe / and I believe it well. For Pope
Hyld^brandus (which inhibited prestes marriage) poisoned: vi. of his
predecessors to optaine the papacye. Pope victor the third was poisoned at
his mass by a spiritual chaplayne of his. So was henrye the.vii. Emprour by
one Bernardinus de monte policiano a dominick fryre / in receyuinge the
sacrament. Pope Clement the second / vigilius. Sisinnius / Ioannes septimus /
Alexander / and above.xl. of them more / were sent out of the world by the
same spiritual polecye. How many poor christian innocents the.ii. horned
termagauntes of England has put unto death for the only truth of God / it
were much to write. Wynchestre yet alive is found no sluggarde in tha^
torme^ting office of Anticrist though he neither s^yth Standyshe nor Pantolabus
fryre wattes nor quarry y^ pardoner / with soche other abominable blasphemers of
Gods word. Therefore tyranny also might have (...) in for a child of
wickedness and a brother of myschefe / if it had pleased master Pantolabus. So
might cruel murder / the slaughter of saints / and the utter contempt of God
/ have been called the filthy of spring thereof / and not poor Johan wycclef
the very manne of God / for withstandinge Anticrist and his false kingedome /
if the true quarrel of Christ had here been so ernestlye sought as is the Popes
quarrel / though it be not so spoken.

3 That any manne should be father to his grande father / as Pantolabus here
notes Johan Wyclef / it is a matter impossible in the right course of
generation. But as he has a monstruouse wytt / so sends he forth mo^struouse
fruits to deceive y^ simple. Of a spyghtfull malice is it / not of Wyclef but
of the verite that he taught / that he thus names him the son of mischefe.
For Wycleues father as co^cerninge the flesh was a christen beleuer / and a man given to no^ ill ^ha^ we read of. I can not tell what evil sprete has
taught Pantolabus to be a slau^derouse accuser of his brother / unless it were
he that accused Job. And as concerning the inward manne / he was a son of
God / like as all they are by his heavenly gift that believe in his name. For
non can protest that Jesus is the Lord God / as he ded most constauntlye
against the whole regne of Anticrist / but in the holy ghost. For so much as
raylinge Pantolabus falselye reports of Johan Wyclef without auctorite that
he brought in his grandefather sin / I am enforced to answer in his behalf
by y^ auctorite of soche notable writers as I have seane and read.

Johan Wyclef being an English ma^ne borne / and a doctor of divinity /
about y^ year of owr Lord a.M.CCC. and.lx. read the common lecture at
oxforde / and so co^tynued many years after. And as co^cerninge his eloquence
/ wit / manyfolde lerninge and most innocent life / Philippus repingedon
Bishop of Lyncolne / Nicolaus herforde a Doctor / Ioannes Treuisa / Galfridus
Chawcer / Ioannes Husse / Eneas Siluius Hermannus Shedel / and now in owr time
O tho Brunfelsius has in most ample form described them / besides the large
witness of his enemies / as of Johan kyuyngham / Thomas Walden / and soche
other. yea / soche time as Wyllya^ Thorpe in his examinacion reported him to be
a man of most christen sobryete / conforminge his life and lerninge to the
doctrine of Christ and the lyuinge of his Apostles. Thomas Arondell than
Archebysshop of Canterberye / being both an aduersarye to him and to the
verite that he had taught / affermed him with his own mouth to be a great
clarke and a perfight liver. The stomach that he bare agei^st him was for his
doctrine. For that (he said) was* not agreeable to the laws of holy church.
And yet he grants before that it was agreeable to Christ and to his Apostles.
He could not away in deed with their popish tradicions / but called them the
filthy fruits of Anticrist. He said he would no longar aparell the Ass that
Christ should ride upon with their vain rytes and ceremonies / but follow the
clear doctrine of his Sauer Jesus / which glorified in heaven / has need of no
soche Idell offices to be done to him.

king Edward the third sumwhat favored him for his godly giftis / as I have
sufficientlye to prove it. So ded king Richard the second as he durst
preuylye / with afterward cost him his life. In this believe Johan Wyclef
continued / and was person of Lutterworth in lyncolne shere. And in the year of
owr lord a.M.CCC.lxxxvii. this true Apostle of Christ most constantlye and
cristenlye departed from this world comme^dinge his soul into the hands of
God. His works were wonderful and many / as I intend to declare God lendinge
me life in an other work. Of whom Subinco lepus than Bishop of Prage / brent
more than.ii. hondreth great volumes fair written / as witnesses Eneas
Siluius in his book de origin Bohemorum. The.xli. year after his death /
which was the year from Christ's incarnacio^ a M.CCCC. and.xxviii. by a cruel
decree from the general counsel of Co^stance / were his bones taken up again
and brent by the clergy of England / as testifies Walden in lib. de
sacramentalibus Cap. 89. et fo. 199. to make foles afraid. No^ has condemned
this wyclef for an heretyque / but the Pope and his sworn soudiours whose
cause / matter / and quarrel Pantolabus has here taken upon him to defend /
though it be with a small faith to God and his Prince / and much less
honest to his own preciouse person.

4 As touching his allegacion out of Iohans first Epistle. Qui facit peccatum
exdiabolo est / to prove that mischefe begat Wyclef. The devil his master (of
whom it is there spoken) might have uttered (...) as godly and to as much
edificacion of y^ (...) the as he has done here. He that does sin (says the
text) is of the devil. For the devil still synneth after his old wo^^e and
can do non other. I maruele of Pantolabus that he could thus with this clause
blaspheme his dead brother in the hands of God / without all godly fear /
and think not therein to sin. If he had marked the argument of that chapter
well / he should have found in it Gods singular love toward us / to that end
that we should love here one an other. And not to condemn by name or to make
raylinge rymes of him because the Pope has condemned him before. For by non
other auctorite is Wyclef conde^pned. Who securses God does bless / and again
does curse his blessings. Let Pantolabus therefore be ware. For though he has
now both his good lord of Wynchesters blessing and the Popes / he may
chance yet to dwell under Gods curse.

I Wondre that the Bysshppes so narrowlye serchinge for heretiq^s / ca^ not
here smell out both an heretic and a traitor. Happlye they are so used to
that sauer out of their own bosoms / that they know not the one from the
other. But may say. Thu and I are both one mannis children. Say well by me /
and I shall do as much forth. By this text folowinge is Wyclef discharged of
that Pantolabus lays to him. Qui natus est ex deo / peccatum non facit /
quonia^semen ipsius in Deo manet. He that is borne of God (as Johan Wyclef was
receyuynge Christ's doctrine in faith) synneth not / he following that doctrine
in his life though he does despise all the Popes tradicions / as he ded also.
For the sede of God which is his eternal word remayninge still in him / will
not permyt hi^ to sin by no soche blasphemouse popetrye. This straight way
having the sure promises of God perseyueth not Pantolabque / but strayeth
wyldelye a broad with the renegate Cain / desperatlye trustinge to the promises
of men syckle and uncertain / as their tradicions has non other.

A mysterye.
1 After this brother. Came forth an other. 2 His name to discuss. Men
called him husse. 3 He and his cumpanye. Began in Germanye. 4. He^ est gens que
non audiuit vocer^ domini sui. Hiere. 2.
The openinge. 1.
EVermore does pantolabus pranke forth with his pylde Popyshe Poesyes not
unlike Jack of Bedlem with his net full of wolle. From that bryer has he
gathered that lock all tarrye / and from that thorn that patche all dryseled.
Let him that has either lerninge or wit / mark what dyrtye get this is /
and from what good authors borrowed. The ground thereof was first taken out of
Pope Benedyct the.xiii. pope Gregorye the.xii. and Pope Johan the.xxiii. all
three deposed at ones in the general counsel of Co^stance / and out of the
cowyshe acts and proclamacyons of Pope Martyne the fifth which after supplied
their rome there upon the seat of the beast in the dark kyngedom of Anticrist
or the chair of pestylence whether ye will. Here is the name of a brother most
scornefullye used / which is in the scripturs both holy and preciouse And no
maruele. For crist said there should come soche swyne as would tread the fair
pearls under their fete / and soche dogs also as would turn again and
tear his true disciples. The chief cause of it is / that his hipocrites eyes
can abide no light. But let him not think so to avoid the great indignacion
of God / nor yet any other soche scorner as he is.

2 Johan Husse that holy Apostle and true Martyr of Jesus Christ / much
pyteynge to se y^ church so wretchedlye deformed with hypocresye / pride /
Idolatrye / and other abhominacio^s of Anticrist / after he had sum what
perseyued thereof by the doctrine of Johan Wyclef / put forth his own body to
y^ cross for it / to suffer the death if need should require it. The pure law
of the Gospel wa^ the scripturs of both testame^tes ded he most constantlye
preach to the pople of Boheme against that kingdom of wickedness / detestinge
all errors / heresies / and scysmes. His conversation was according to his
instruccyons / perfight and holy. Not only by the report of.liiii. noble
men of the land of Morania / but also by the testimonye of his enemies /
Pope Pius otherwise called E^e as Siluius / Pogius the Florentyne / Platina /
Sabellicus / and soche other. In the open counsel of Constance spared not he
to confess y^ true faith of his Lord Jesus Christ to the death / and was at
the last condemned thereunto at the suggestions of the Dominick fryres and
other unlearned sophisters. He said that it behooved the Bysshoppes and clergy
to be poor after the example of christ and not so to five in pride an^
voluptuousness. And this was the only article wherefore he was brent there to
ashes / though the papists has practiced other.

3 What Pantolabus means by that cu^panye of his which began in Germanye /
I can not tell / unless they be the Hussytes as the wytlesse Papists does
call them. I know well that both the Apostles and Prophets were of that
opinion / yet were they no Germans borne. No More dishonor is it to the most
worihye land of Germanye to bescornefullie dispraysed of pantolabus / than it
is unto gold to be bespryncled with swynes dyrt. Consideringe that after the
mind of Seneca it is so filthy a thing to be co^me^ded of him that is vile /
as to be commended for fylthynesse. But this makes me greatly to wondre. That
so many heretics being before this time / as were Hebion / Cerinthus /
Carpocras / Marcion / Basilides / Arrius / Cerdo / Pelagius / Eunomius /
Nestorius / Dioscorus / E^tices / Sabinus / Faustus / Donatus / Heluidius /
Manes / Montanus / Nouatus / Porphirius / Petulianus / Sabellius / Sergius /
Simachus / Vigilancius / Valens / Macedonius / Artemon / Simon Magus / and a
great na^bre besides / which were heretyques indede blasphemige the godhede and
divinity of crist besides his humanite and death / yet is there not one of
them in all this Genealogy.

The cause paraue^ture why he towcheth them not is this. They were for y^ more
part Bysshoppes and great Prelates / whose quarrel he has here taken upon him
to defend and not so to blemishe. There were in the old law ill sects / as
Pharisees / Saducees / Herodyanes / and Samaritanes. And in the new law also
Saracenes / Turks / Jews / and Iacobynes. There has been Popes which has
been poyseners / Bishops that has be^ bawdes / Prests that has been trayters
/ fryres / monks / and chano^s which has been hypocrites / so^cerers / and
sodomites / and that in a wonderful no^bre / yet is there not one regestred in
all this generation of heresye. Not one heretyque is yet here named / but poor
Johan Wyclef and Johan Husse / of all the heretics that has been sens
christ's ascensio^. And they are here regestred because they were the Popes
utter enemies. If any other heresies than that had moved the stomach of
Pantolabus / all the other could not thus have been left out. But a man may
smell the tree by the fruit. He that seyth not some light at this hoole / is
wurthye to be blind always. It will not away (they say) that is bred by the
bone. Full sweet unto them is that holy father of theirs.

4 The clause of Hieremye that he has here unto annexed / He est ge^s que non
audiuit vocem dominisui / is not there written in the second Chapter. And if it
were / yet would it not serve to prove that Husse and his cumpanye began in
Germanye / nor yet that the Germans neglected the voice of God when they
forsook the Pope. For the Pope is not their Lord. But in deed this text is in
that Chapter. Tenentes legem / nescierunt me. They which have the law in their
hands knows me not. They have walked after their own fantasies / and are
now become all vain. They have defiled my pleasant land (says the Lord)
and turned mine heretage into abhominacio^. The prestes have dishonored me /
and the preachers have done their homage unto Baall. They have forsaken me the
well of lyuinge water / and dygged them broken pyttes that will hold no
moystre. They have called y^ stock their father / and the stone their creator.
They have stained my ways with blasphemy / they have taught their own
malycyouse mischefe / and upon their wings is found the blood of innocent
sowles. All this with much more is in that second chapter of Hieremie / yet
could it not serve the purpose of Pantolabus / but he must bring forth a text
of his own making against the Germans / because they have not obeyed the Pope.

A mysterye.
1 And after that. Came in a gnat. 2 Of the same kind. Whose soul is
blind. 3 His name you shall here. Men call him Luthere.
The openinge.1.
F^rth halteth Pantolabus and still takes great pains hereto manifest his
own madness / and to defend y^ small veriu and less grace of his popish
generacio^: The gnat that his blind predecessers has so long strayned out /
has he no grace to perseyue / for all the light that has been in the world
these.xx. years and more. He fares like a froward curre which barketh against
the moon for shyninge in his face in the night. He seyth not that those blind
gydes of his are curyouslye busyed in things of no value / but in the wayghtye
causes of the gospel they are all negligent and untoward. Great religion
sh^we they in foppryes for auau^tage / but the holy commandments of God
they miserablye conte^pne. Bishop Bo^ner made To^wyn to stand forth at Paul's
Cross for a notoryouse heretyque now of late / because he made not his holy
water relygiouslye after the popes old rewles and by cause he went not
procession with Orapro nobis at ^uensonge But ye never se him nor other of his
f^llawes put any to open shame for not preachinge the Gospel / or for doing
Idolatrye / sorcerye / murder / rape / and violence. Or for misusinge me^nis
wives / dowrers / servants / and children / with soche other fysthye
enormite^s. Of all the Sodomitee they have as there are among them
innumerable) ye never saw one yet stand forth for an heretyque. No / alsoche
mattere are discharged in y^ court without conscience.

2 Whom Pantolabus means by that gnatt that should be of the same kind with
Wyclef and Husse / and whom he judges in soul to be blind / we understand
by that which follows here after. It is Mariyne Luther the very trompet of
this latter age of Christ's Church / whose boots to rub / and to follow him
with a wyspe to the Iakes Pantolabus should seem to be more fyt / than either to
judge his lerninge or decerne his faith. Who has s^ane a more dodypoll fool
and a more blind assehead / than he shows himself here in these dyrtye
Poesyes? He that judges them not to be the fruits of a soul supersticiouse
and most wretchedly darkened / has very small godly understanding. If that
soul be not blind with judges whight to be black and virtue to be sin /
there is no soul blind in my opinion. Sum time was he rekened for an
heretyque that dissented in opinion from the Gospel and from the special
articles of owr Christen faith. But now is it nothing so. For in this whole
descripcion of heresye is not one found of that hind / as I have showed twyse
before. But here are they noted only for heretyques which has renounced the
Popes obedience. Therefore it is a new manner of heresye that is here set out for
men to be ware of / than was in those days.

3 God has at a time permitted the false Prophet to speak that was true. As
we have for example. Balaam the sorcerer / Saul the disobedient king / Cayphas
the cruel Bishop / and Pylate the unrightful judge. But he gave them not
with it to understand that they uttered. Pantolabus has here mentioned
Martyne Luther to be of the same kind that Wyclef and Husse were of. yet has
he done yt of a wicked sprete / and knows not what he has written. But the
Prophecye of the said Johan Husse which he vttred at the hour of his death /
shall make that saying good. Centum reuolutis annis / Deo respondebitis e^
mihi. An hondreth years ones past (says he to the papystes) to God shall ye
answer and to me. By this he meant that after an hondreth years / they should
begin to consent to his doctrine who^ at y^ time they condemned / and in
process of time grant it to be agreeable to the scriptures of God. This
Prophecye ded the Bohemes inprint upon the one side of their coins and so
reserved it from the year of owr Lord a. M.CCCC and.xv. till unto the year
of owr Lord again a. M.CCCCC. and.xvii. In the wc Martyne Luther impugned the
Popes pardons / power / and auctorite by the open word of God. And therefore
Pantolabus has spoken it truly / that Luther is of the same kind. But where
as he has done it of spyght and malice / he shows himself to be of a
contrary part. As where that Luther is the popes great enemy / he is his
trustye frinde and lover.

A mysterye.
1 He by his mean. Has ba^nyshed clean. 2 Out of that cost. The holy
ghost. 3 And has brought inn. Lyberte and sin. 4 Posuerunt templu^
sanctum. Psalm. 78.
The openinge. 1.
GReat business makes Pantolabus herewith Martyne Luther for bannishynge that
sprete of theirs which has so long vpholden their popish church of proud
porkelynges / the synagoge of Satan / the rose colored whore / and the spowse
of the devil. This sprete is not the holy ghost as he is here reported / but
the sprete which went out from the manne and returned again with.vii. spretes
worse tha^ himself. As with the sprete of error / the sprete of falshede /
the sprete of sorcerye / the sprete of lies / the sprete of fornicacion / the
sprete of hypocresye / and the sprete of the utter contempt of God with all
other abhominacyons of vayneglorye malice / muther / and Idolatrye. In these
spretes have they governed their gloriouse church of Antichrist / ever sens
they sprange up under Phocas with Mahomete. Specyallye sens Syluester the
sorcerer fat the devil from hell to grant to his confirmacion and to give him
the iurisdiccyon of both swerdes. In these filthy spretes also have their
horned whoremongers ever sens by the same auctoryte bannished all godly
veritees and knowledge / ex^rcysynge all tyranny / cruelte / and vyolence
possible / to hold the people in darkness and ignorant blyndenesse. And this
in deed has Martyne Luther like christ's true disciple with all dilygence
sought to redress / which moves not a little here the sick stomach of
Pantolabus / he being the Popes Apostle.

2 But that holy ghost which is the spre of wisdom / knowledge / counsel /
force / science / pity / and the true fear of God / has not Martyne Luther
exyled / as he is here of this lymme of the devil most falselye reported. His
works shall in this point stand with him as witnesses against Wynchestre
Bonner / Standishe / Wattes / Quarrye the pardoner / Pantolabus / and all their
affinite / though they have all the deuyls of hell upon their side. He that
shall read his book against y^ Jews / quod Christus Iude^s sit natus / and his
commentaries upon the scripturs with his other treatyses / conferring them
with the Popes old divinity / Decrees / and Decretals / Extrauagantes /
Clementynes / and Synodals / shall find them so much to dyffer from them as
light does dyffer from darkness or Christ from Belial / if he be Christenlye
learned. It fares here by Pantolabus as it does by him that daunseth naked in a
not / thinking that no man seyth him when all the world beholds him a
presumptuouse Idyote fool. No ma^ne there is which seyth any truth / but
perseyueth that the sprete which provoke Martyne Luther to destroy the Popes
kyngedo^ / is a clean contrary sprete to that wc has reigned in the Pope and
his clergy. And therefore if the Popes sprete be of y^ devil as the scripture
says it is / his sprete must nede^ b^: of God. And therefore Pantolabus holy
ghost (whom Luther has bannisshed) is not of God but of the devil.

3 What lyberte this is that Pantalabus here coupleth with sin making them
all one / (...) ca^ not well tell / unless it be fre will. And there unto
gives Martyne Luther no lyberte that is godly / as testifyeth his book de
Seruo arbitrio. And therefore is Pantolaus much to be blamed so to slaundre him.
But in deed his Lord of Wynchestre has brought in that lyberte now of late by
y^ good help of Ecki^s the dowtye doctor of the papystes / and takes great
pains upon him to make it a new article of the faith of England. I think
not the contrary but his great hot stodye is also to set up purgatory again
/ reparinge the broken chest of y^ churches old suffrages / deseruinges / and
merits / to redeem the brent sowles and send them to haue^ by the virtue of
Scala cel^. And therefore if Pantolabus find fawte in the bringinge in of that
lyberte / let him blame his good lord for it and not Luther. The sin that
he here speaks of should seem to be Prestes marryage. For that in deed they
put out as an horrible sin when they took their oyled orders and were married
to Sodom and Gomor. If Luther has brought that in again and driven out their
sovereign lady and sweet sacred Sodomye / he is worthy to be condemned of
them for an heretyqye. For holy Pope Hyldebra^de which was a Necromanser made
this constitucion / that non should be admitted to holy orders / unless he
forsware marriage for term of his life. Which constitucion hurt him nothing
at all / he having at his pleasur Mawde y^ Duchess of Lotharyne with many
other more out of marryage.

4 Far out of frame is the scripture / which he has here alleged to conferme
with his folyshe purpose / Polluerunt templum tuum. O lord God (says Asaph the
prophet) a people is broken into thine heritage / which has defiled thy holy
temple. If the Popes church were meant by that temple / this text is falselye
applied to Luther and his company. For they have not broken into that church
/ but gone out of it as all the world knows. And in the verses folowinge are
they mencyoned / that destroyed the faithful servants of God by sheding
their blood and geuynge their flesh to the fowls of the air. Effuderunt
sanguinem little tanquam aquam. What they are that have y^ true beleuers in
soche deadlye derysio^ / it were easy enough to perseyue though we had
nothing else to prove it but this present Genealogye. Never shall ye ^e that
spiritualte of theirs persecute any other / tha^ the lovers of the truth.
Wynchestre at this hour honteth nether for thief nor murderer / aduouterer
nor whore keeper. If he ded / there should not so many of them so boldelye
devil at the next door to him. But there shall not apere a reader of Christ's
gospel / that he shall not have by the sleue by and by. He s^yth not
Pantolabus here / which is an heretyque in deed / if an heretyque be a
peruerter of y^ scripturs / for they are of an other vein that he coueteth. He
should not else be his mothers own darlynge.

HEre though I seem sumwhat to digrede / yet shall it be no digressyon / but a
necessary rela^yon / consyderyng that Pantolabus has so spyghtfullye accused
matrymonye for sin. Sumwhat shall it be needful to show here to the
commendacyon of that godly estate of living / and to the utter reproach and
shame of the contempners thereof by the scriptures and chronicles. To non other
end ded y^ Pope with his prelates first inhybyt prestis their marryage / but to
apere thereby an holy spiritual kingdom divided from the profane multitude /
and to live in all voluptuousness and deceyt. Mark first their ungodly
sprete by this. The lord commanded not David to put from him Bersabe after
the death of Vrias for the aduouterye before committed / but both allowed her
after for his wife / and also greatly loved the second fruit of her begotten
which was Solomon. The Rome church as a congregacyon clean contrary to God
in that / commanded their prestes first not only to forsake their most
lawful wives / but also to leave their most dear children as fruits of
fornicacyon / which cruelte we have also felt in this age. And thus has holy
wedlock been unto them ever sens a most pernycyouse poison / and stynkynge
whoredom with buggerye a most suffren remedy of their natural dyssease.
Soche has been their sathanycall tyranny ever sens.

A great aduersarye to that holy office was Pope Nycolas the first in the
year of our lord. D.ccc.lxiiii. till Huldrichus the good bishop of Augus^a
in Germanye withstode his deuyllyshe hypocresye. yet was a wife non impediment
to holy ^aynt Nycolas long before that / which was of a common cytezen made
the archebisshop of Myr^hea and metropolytane of all the whole land of Lycia.
No More was it to Ignacius / Hermas / An^anus / Pheleas / Spiridion / Valens /
Hilarious / Polycrates / Dionysius Corintheorum / Tartulianus / Cheremon /
Basilius senior / Gregorius Nazianzenus / Eupsichtus / Philogonius / Vitalis /
Apollinaris / Vrsinus / Pharo Burgundus / Genebaudus / Geroldus / and a great
sort more / which had both wyu^s and children / and yet they all were prestes
and bisshoppes. Much better (says Baptista Mantuanus) was their ^yfe in
marryage / than is now the life of the spiritualte without it. For a great
consyderacyon (says Pius the Second Pope / otherwise called Eneas Siluius)
was marriage first inhibited to prestes / but for a much greatter ought yt
again to be granted them. Saint Peter y^ holy Apostle was not ashamed at
Antiochia / when his wife was led unto death to call her by her name (which
was Eolam / or in the latyne Perpetua after writers) And to say unto her in
the mids of the multitude. Sweet wife remember thy Lord Jesus Christ / and
fear not the^ which sleyth the body / for they can do no harm to the soul.

Only covetousness and ambycion interdicted this marryage / which has given
or casion to wonderful mischeues / as I have declared at large in my answer
for Tolwyn against the Bishop of London. To whom I have added these historyes
following upon just occasyons here given me / because they are yet so good unto
marriage. Pope Johan the. viii. was a woman / and was begotten with child by
her own dear chaplayne and chamberlayne a Cardinal / which God at that time
would have known to the world that their church might apere as it was in deed
/ all whorishe / filthy / and beastlye / like as the Apocalips has described
her. yet was the world so blind / that it never perseyued it / till now of
late years. Marozia caused her husband Guido / which was than Marquis of
Chuscia / to strangle Pope Johan the.ix. with a pyllowe and to slay his brother
Peter / that the bastard which she had by Pope Sergi^s the third when she was
his concubyne / might be saint Peter's vycar after his father. As he was sone
after in deed / and was called Pope Johan the.x. Johan the.xii. Pope begat of
his whore Johan the.xiii. Pope / and in short space after was stryken to death
of the denyll as he was in doing an other holy act of bytcherye.

By the auctorite and commandment of this holy vycar of satan / ded saint
Donstane here in England forbydde Prestes their wives / and had thereunto the
assistence of king Edgare. By the which occasyon Oswaldus than bishop of
Worcestre / expelled the canons out of their cathedral church and out of.vi.
churches more of his dyocese / and thrist in monks there to supplye their
romes / only because they world not leave their wives / for he his self had
also been a monk. E^helwoldus in like case the bishop of Wynchestre / ded the
same self holy act also at the same time in his dyocese / for ^e arose also
of y^ same generacyon. The prestes not contented with so spyghtfull an ^niurye /
thought they would be even with saint Donstane for it / as they were in deed.
For when he should make his purgacyon before the king in y^ general synod /
for soche matters as they had by that time bulted out / he had much a do to
save all things honest / yet had he both the prelated and king upon his side.
For holy fathers will at a time be as wanton as other poor men / and smell
after smockes for all their holiness. Holy Tomas Becket would sumtyme for his
pleasure make a iournaye of pilgrimage to the prymerose peerlesse of Stafforde
/ as his holy life mencyoneth.

He that shall narrowlye search saint Hieromes Epistles / shall find him
sumwhat famylyar with Marcella. So shall he find Saint Gregorye with Domicella
/ and also saint Bonifacius the archebisshop of Magunce with Tecla and
Lieba.ii. English women of his own cuntre natyue. After the death of king
Edgare this bredde much trouble in England. For the great men of the realm
put out y^ monks by vyolence / and restored again the Prestes with their
wives / till soche time as a counsel was holden at Wynchestre. Where as the
prestes were again dyscharged / by virtue of a voice which came from a rode in
the freyter wall (here was propre packynge) or else from the devil speaking in
him. For in deed the devil loves well / and first sought out that holy kind
of chastyte for to bewtyfye therewith the Popes holy church / and also to fill
hell. We read of a watchynge devil (whether he were a pressed or no that can I
not tell) but he begat Marlyne the great Prophet of Wales of an holy nonne
of saint Peter's in Carmalyn / which was the dowter of the king of Demecia / to
conferme this blessed storye with all.

About a fourscore years after that was one Alwinus then bishop also of
Wynchestre accused of ill rule with Emme king Edwardes mother / and so
committed to the examynacyon of the clergy in the year of our Lord a
thousand and fyftye / but through spiritual fauer he escaped it full well. As
witnesses Rhegino pruniensis / when Charles the second Emprour returned
again into Almanye from his wars with the Norm^nes / he found Limphardus
the bishop of Versell (which was his chief counselor) so famylyar with his
wife or empress Richarda / that he could do no less than lay aduouterye to
his charge. Remigius the bishop of Dorcestre / was depryued of his
bisshoprycke by Pope Alexander the second / because he was proved a prestes
son. Either had prestes wives of their own in those days / or else there was
some other good workemanshyp a broad. As ^uda^icus y^ archebisshop of
^^adeburge was daunsynge at mydnyght in a town called Ca^ua with her that he
loved best / he suddenly fell dead and never recovered it / in the year of
our Lord a M.CCC.lxxxiii.

As that holy nonne lay a dyenge which brought forth at one birth / Petrus
Lombatdus the master of the sentences / Petrus Commestor the master of the
hystories / and Gracianus monachus the master of the Popes laws or decrees /
and was admonisshed of her ghostlye father to be sorye for that aduo^trye / for
soth father (quoth she) I can not repent it / considering that holy church
has received soche three lyghtes thereof. Johan Eckius that impudent warryour
of anticrist / and the only instructour of England in that article and certain
other / in the book which he farelye made against Martyne Luther / grau^teth
himself not to be Amartiton / o^ a ma^ne all without sin. He can not (he
says) excuse himself / but that he has been as other men are which has
not observed the chastyte of Hypolitus / for if he ded we know the contrary.
yet will not that brent consciensed hypocrite / afferme it to be lawful for a
pressed to marye in the lord / so indurate is he to this hour.

Though Benedict the.xii. Pope granted to Franciscus Petrarcha / which was a
Canon of Padua / and archedeacon of Parma to take one Laureta to wife /
retayninge still his benefices / yet would he not afferme it lawful that
prestes might marrye / but only by soch blind dispensacio^s for his own
carnal purpose. For this was the chief cause of his benevolence toward him.
Petrarcha had a fair sister in Auinion in the house of his brother Ghirarde /
whose felyship the holy father ded inwardlye couete / workynge many feate
polycies for it. He promised besides this special prerogative unto y^ said
Petrarcha / to make him a Cardinal / and to give him great goods / in case
he would bring it to pass. Unto whom as a man fearing God Petrarcha made
this answer. The lord of heaven forbydde (says he) that ever so filthy a
diadem should cover my head. And with this he departed the Popis court / and
so fled into Italy / recompensynge there shortly after by wrytinge this
unworthy demand of the Pope / as testifyeth Philelphus. His impacable furye
not yet qualyfyed / this holy father by manyfolde gifts and rewards made
Ghirarde his brother a mannefyt for his hand and so at the last abhominably
corrupted the maid. For the which the seyde Ghirarde having great remorse of
conscience / made himself a Charterose monk in Materne not far from
Marsilia / to make all to the devil.

Petruo Ryarius a mynorite or graye fryre of Genua / and pressed cardinal of
saint Sixte in Rome / procured of Pope Sixtus y^ fort his uncle by the help of
his brother Hierome / a dispensacyon for the whole how should of the cardinal
of Saint Lucie / to have the fre occupyenge of buggerye boys for the.iii.
hotter months of the year / with this clause in the end / F^at vt petitur. O
fylthynesse no^ to be spoken / but that their hypocresye requires it in these
latter days / the vengeance of God most depelye hanging over them. No More am
I now ashamed to open their abhominacions / than they are yet still with the
dissembling title of their stynkinge chastyte to cover them. The said
religions^ cardinal Peter spent within the space of two years.ii. hundred
thousand florence in most prodigiouse lecherye. And dyed all rotted in that
fylthynesse in the.xxviii. year of his age / the year of our lord ^
M.CCCC.lxxiiii. Petrus Mendosa the cardinal of Valencia in Spain was not
only satisfied with y^ queen under king Ferdinandus nose / besides other
whores / but he sent to the Pope for a license to occupye his own son the
marquis of zanet. What ruff^lynge Pope Julius made with the cardinal of Nantes
in Brytayne for two young laddes which the French queen Anne committed unto him
/ it would abhor honest ears to hear.

Pope Clement the.vii. was reported of some writers to be a bastard / a
manqueller a po^sener / abawde / a symonyake / a Sodomyte / a periure / a
rauysher / a sorcerer / a sacreleger / and a worker of all other myscheues / as
Wynchestre is now in England / whose chaste life men may conjecture by his
chekes and order. Oh / that the earth open not at soche wretchedness. I
think in Sodom and Gomorre were never soche prodigiouse kinds of fylthynesse
as are yet in that spiritualte / yet will they be still a chaste generacyon and
hold marryage for sin. The sister of Alexander farnesius (which is now saint
Peter's vycar / if he has any / under the name of the.iii. Paul) was at this
narraw point with Pope Leo the.x. no longar to be his own sweet lemanne
unless he would make her brother a cardinal after his wife was dead / which
was than but his scrybe and co^ueyar. In all have possible was this granted
and performed / he constitute bishop of Hostyense. These and soche other like
examples of holy church are the fruits of Pantolabus holy ghost / that
Luther has bannysshed by his manyfolde heresies. And in the sted of them has
he brought in marriage / whom Pantolabus has dyffyned to be sin here / though
it be the clear institucyon of God? But parauenture Pantolabus God is not the
God that made marryage / and therefore he dare do that well enough.

A mysterye.
1 Next after him Is his chief lym. 2 One Melanchtonus. Nequaquam bonus. 3
Euanuerun^ in cogitationibus sut^. (...). ^
The openinge. 1.
IN this process following is Pantolabus compelled to play Myhell make shyft.
No longar will his wits serve him to continue forth his genealogy by any
manner way of natural propagacyon. But now he boroweth a lymme of him / and an
other lymme of him. Now seeks he to fatche in that co^mer in and that captain
a broad. Philip Melanchton is here brought in for a lymme of Martyn Luther /
and after that Peter Frank for a lymme of Lambert / yet were they never cuntre
men. Oecolampadius with zwinglius is made a co^mer into help here at a
pynche / ^o is Barnes with Garade and Hierome. And poor Johan Frith is fatt
out a far of / to play the simple captain. So that we are like ere we come
to the end / to close germans lyppes / which never came together (they say)
by seven miles. First he began his high thetorykes in subtyle tropes of
allegorye with Blind obstinacy / Dame ignorance / Debate / Ambicion / and so
forth. And when that would no longar serve him / he stepped to the plain storye
/ and brought forth out of that / Wyclef / Husse / and Luther by name. As much
agree they.ii. in one vein of speaking / as does fire and water / which be of
a contrary nature. And therefore we are like to have a wise conclusyon. yet if
all other things fayl^ / we shall have the fruits of an folysshe idle brain.

2 Now comes he to the declaracyon of the two subtyle verses which went before
/ wherein ye shall find much good lernyng / if ye mark them well when he has
expowned them. One Melanchtonus (he says) nequaquam bonus / and he shows
no more of him. Is not here think you a lompe of good doctrine: Does not the
prelates of England much to the common welthe of the realm / to send forth
soche an wholesome teacher: yes marrye I trow / and they would be sorye to send
forth any other. Here is Philip Melanchion (whom all Christendom commends
for his most excellent leruynge) detected for an heretyque of this braynelesse
hypocrite and blasphe mouse beastlye babbler / non artycles of heresye
expressed. But never the worse is the fair fine gold / though the filthy
ratte beshyteth it. For naught is it not that this is done in Latyne he should
not else apere so well learned. Sumwhat we must have to sprede forth our shyrtes
with / and to have our phylacteri^s seane / all were not else worth a fart. But
if Nequa quam bonus / with insipie^s colonus / had be put to Ho^tyngtonus / it
had made a better sonus. O insipient papists / that ye have no more wytt but to
vttre soche folyshnesse. All the world may se by this and soche other / how
vain ye are in your stodyes / and soydle in your fantasyes.

3 The scripture that ye have brought forth here / out of saint Paul's Epistle
to the Romans / Euanuerunt in cogitationibus suis is as ryghtlye your own
good as is possible. For yt is spoken there unto them that withholde the truth
of God in vnryghtousnesse / as you do here in this jest of yours / and as does
your whole popysshe generacyon / beco^mynge all vain in your thoughts / and
having your folysshe hearts so darkened. But I maruele sore when ye read
that chapter / why ye marked not this clause following. Propterea tradidit vos
Deus in passiones ignominy etc. For your obstynate frowardness has the
sorde given you over into most shameful lusts / and suffered you to work
fylthynesse among yourselues leaving the natural use of women. This has he
given you as a due reward of your error / for that ye have turned his verite
to a lie / and served the creature rathe^ than y^ creator or maker. This
therefore does rather perteyne to you than to Melanchton: for yo^ contempne
marryage / and not he / you are the Sodomites / and not he. you are the
abominable ydolaters / sensynge still stocks and stones / and not he. It is
you most execrable papists that are there now noted to be full of iniquite /
malice / fornicacyon / (...) / falshede / envy / murder / contencyon / fraud
/ frowardness / and so forth as follows there in course / and not these
godly men.

A mysterye.
1 Next after this vvhelpe Came in to help. 2 One Oecolampadius / With his
brother zvinglius.
The openinge. 1.
Knowledge I think very small has Pantolabus of y^ godly learned men whom
here he rayleth upon in his folysshe jest / and that apereth by the indiscreet
order thereof. For here he reports Oecolampadius and zwinglius to come after
Melanchton in the mayntenaunce of that doctrine. Where as they were auncye^t
men when Melanchton was but a child / and were promoters of the Lords veryte
when he knew nothing of yt. And therefore the ma^ne is well ouerseane in the
matters he takes in hand. Before was Melanchton a lymme of Luther / and now
he is become a whelpe / but we know not whereof. Dogs / cattes / and all will
be little enough ere we have done I fear me / to make a wys^ end of our
genealogye. We fare syke him that putt to his cart both his bore and his sow
with pigs / when he had not horse enough to draw home his harvest. Solomon
calls you the wylye whespes of the fox which has destroyed the vynes.
Hieremye tells you that ye have broken down the Lords byne yard / and
trodden under your fete his pleas^unt possessyon / making his land a
wilderness. I maruele therefore ye regestre them not here for heretyques. Both
Christ and Johan Baptist does call you adders whelps and the filthy frye of
the serpent / yet have you no grace to believe yt.

2 Ioannes Decolampadius is the first of the two that ye here blaspheme / which
was borne in the land of Sueuia. This was a man of incomparable learning /
and a most pure professor of the Gospel. An excellent Orator / Poet /
Philosopher / Historiane / Lawer / and doctor of diuynite / throughlye expert
in the Latyne / Greek / Hebrew / and Chaldie / whose innocent life no man
could iustlye reprove. In Bononie / Hyltprunne / Heydelberge / Basyle / and
Augusta was he both a common reader and also an open preacher / not without
great name of his auditorye. He translated out of the Greek into the Latyne /
many works of saint Johan Chrysostom / saint Lyrillus / Athanasius /
Damascenus / Theophilactus / and other. More than lvi. volumes upon the
scripturs with other treatyses compyled he / which are greatly commended of
them that be learned. Much a do he had with Johan Faber a Suffragan and fryre /
with Eckius / Empser / Cochleus Fysher of Rochestre / Latomus / Clichtoueus /
Pyrkeimerus / Pelargus / and diverse other great warryours of Antichrists host
/ whom he answered by Apologyes / besides his contynuall conflictes with the
Anabaptists / and other sects. At the last he departed hence most godly in
the.liii. year of his age / and in the year from Christ's incarnacyon a M. D.
and.xxxi. even the very bewtye of Christen learning / whom Erasmus an other
light of our age / called a very pure the^logyane.

3 Husdricus zwinglius borne in the land of Heluecia / was a man also of
most syngular erudicyon and equal with y^ other in all feats of learning. In
all that he ded in his common lecturs and preachynges / he stodyed to be brefe
and plain. Never was there any that ever kynt up more surely / nor that sent
again the adversaries darts more sharpelye. He that shall read his book De
prouide^cia D^^ / besides his other.xxxvi. works / shall say if he be learned
/ that he is equal with the best that ever set pen to paper. M^che labor
he took to extyrpe soche vices as the p^ple of custom were given unto. For ^he
which at the last he suffered most cruel death in the.xlviii. year of his age
/ a M.D. and.xxxi. from Christ's incarnacyon / the.xi day of Octobre. Of them
was he slain / cut in pieces / and brent in defending the common welthe of
his cite / for whom he had before taken wonderful peynes to bring them into
the way of ryghtuousnesse. ^o these are the two brethren that Pantolabus here
rayleth upon in his rustycall ^ymes without learning / wytt / and all
godliness. Might we not (think you) say to him with Apelles? Come down ser
sowter / and hold ye still to your last. Be contented with your homblye
occupacyon / and meddle not with that which is beyond your compass.

LIke himself is Pantolabus always / as the common saying is. A fool in the
morning and all day after not wise. He calls these great learned men
praters of diuynyte / yet was he never able to understand one leaf of their
works. I think if he were narrowlye examyned / he should a pere not to know
what true diuy^ite is Of late years now at Oxforde their principal diuynes /
as doctor Roper / doctor kyngton doctor Molle / and soche other / made their
open complayntes that in.xxviii. years stodye they could not understand Dons.
And as for Christ's diuynite / I will bear them record / they knew yt
nothing at all. I think these for that time in their disputacyons and lecturs
were Iolye pratlers of diuynite. And their fruits would declare a great sort of
them to be little better now. Is not here (think you) in this work of
Pantolabus / a plesau^t patche of diuynite: It is no maruele though so noble a
clarke as he complayneth of pratynge / when his self pratleth here so
folyshlye. your draffyshe diuynes / as Dons / Thomas / Guido / Gyles / Ockam /
Baconthorpe / Durande / Gabriel / Dorbel / and a thousand more / has done
little other these.iii. hondreth years but establyshe lies in hypocresye to
falsyfye the scripturs / yet were they no praters of diuynite but good doctors
of holy church. O beastlye Baalamytes / learn ones to be godly wise.

2 What you and your affynite have sought the world over / and what ye seek
yet s^yll / yt is known in this age to many / yet are ye not ashamed of yt.
ye have sought out all the sorceryes of the Gentiles / to fill the people with
their supersticyons. ye have robbed y^ Sophisters of their subtyle conueyaunces
/ to begyle y^ poor innocent sowles. The wylye inuencyons of ^ogycke / the
craftye colors of Rhetoryke / and the preuye practyses of philosophy have ye
gathered together / to deceive all y^ world that knows not your crafts. Not
one slayght is there nor cast of good legerdemayne that any iugler has / but
ye have sought yt out for advantage. Soche subtyle sekers ye are yet to this
day: What ye have sought in other mennis howses / hawles / stabyls / barnes /
butteryes / kychy^s / chambers / parlours / and sumtyme in the good mannys
bed / I think there be few alive but knows. There is not a poor wenche
that takes wages / but ye must have y^ tent part for preuye tithes. There is
not a labourer which lives by the sweat of his brows / but ye must have a
patche thereof / though his children should famyshe at home. your seeking about
y^ world through out is an other manner of matter than the travail of those
godly men has been / whom ye here accuse in your ydelnesse.

3 If ever there were in the world teachers more ungracious than you / I
ma^uele / or if there ever were more perverse preachers / I wondre. What other
has been your doctrine before time / but that the people shul'd believe as holy
church does teach them? That is to say that the Pope was Gods vycar in
earth / and the head of that holy church. That he could not err / and that
his curse was most to be feared. That purgatory was peynefull / pylgrimages
wholesome / masses merytoryouse / diryges medicynable / holy water good for
spretes / and soche other wretched wytcherye. All the ^^odye of your
bysshoppes / practyse of your prestes / dilygence of your relygiouse / and
labor of your vnyuersytees / was about non other thing / but to maynteyne
soche beggerlye baggage. And yt apereth by Wynchestre / Bonner / Tonstall / and
soche other / that ye seek yet non other thing else. The solemn declara^yo^s
of Seyton and Tolwyn shall yet stand forth for witnesses / if need be /
besides the works of Standysshe and Pantolabus. O most shameless hypocrites /
how dare ye be so bold to report other men for ungracious teachers / your
selves offering so ungracious docume^tes to y^ worlde^ Remove first of all y^
great beam of your own / ere ye take y^ small mote from your neyber. He that
shall confer your teachynges with y^ word of God / shall find them
ungracious enough

4 The scripture here alleged for your ungracious purpose: Conueneru^^t in
(...) adu^rsus domin^ and aduersus Chrisium eius / may say that he is full
vngracyouslye handled. David spoke it in prophecye against y^ heythe^ tyrau^tes
/ that should withstand both y^ lord and his word. These (says he) come
together against God and his Christ. Into this myschefe fell at y^ last y^
cruel counsel also of y^ Jews / y^ bishopes / pharisees / lawers / scribes /

poor innocents for yt. Who are y^ kings of y^ earth but they? The other
bear only y^ name / and are but their bochers and slaves. But this should
Pantolabus have also considered. Qui habitat in celis / irridebiteos / and
tanqu^^vas figuli confringet eos. He that sits in heaven shall scorn their
practyses in y^ dredefull day / and dashe them in pieces like an earthen
vessel that is thrown against an hard wall. Let not those termagauntes
think so to escape y^ great vengeance of his indigna^cyon. For there yt does
abide the^ in deed. Though they take here their vain pleasurs for y^ time /
yet is not y^ judgment far of / neither slepeth their da^nacyon / but is

The openinge. 1.
MA^uele yt is to me / if these men sought out ungracious teachers in
England / that they found not out Standysshe and Pantolabus / Bonner and
Wynchestre. I think they could not have found much worse if they had sought
the world all over. No / though they had found out the devil himself. For
in their doctrine is y^ true Christen faith blasphemed / the sacred scripturs
perue^ted most wretchedlye / the servants of God ma^y^ned / the people of the
world deluded / the price of our redempcyon contempned / and all Eabylonishe
beggerye for them persuaded. yea / Standyshe was not ashamed ones in his
filthy preaching to make Christ's blood no better than the blood of a swyne.
There are yet in London a great sort living that hard him yet is he a lewd
preacher still / and not condemned of the bysshoppes for an heretyque. There
shall no soche come in the Gen^alogie of heresye. Pantolabus has here full
honorably beshytt the scripturs / and full like a worshypfull gentylman of y^
Popes church. And so has he putt them forth a broad under the kings
pryuylege. Ad imprimendum solum / both by Robert Wyer and also by Johan Redman
/ which care not what they do for money. yet is he not found out for an
ungracious teacher. But if he had ryghtlye taught the Gospel / he had been
found out ere this time.

2 What labors ye have taken and how busylye ye have applied yt to set up the
kyngedome of the devil by all mad mastryes of ydolatrye / the Chronycles

sparres to hold up your holy mother for falling / we are not so blind but
we perseyue yt. Provide ye for necessaryes apace / and se that she drop not
away suddenly in the fever she has now a days. Bind up her head for
sweruynge / lap up her body warm for sursetynge / and provide her a cawdell
of calves eggs to recover her again if yt may be. Luther has febled her
sore / so has Oecolampadius and zwinglius. Barnes here in England was not all
behind with his part / no more was Johan Frith and Tyndale. But happy ye are
that Thomas Cro^well lived not / for he had by this time made her no very
beuityfull gentle woman. Well / now ye have gotten the ouerhande of her
enemies / apply ye apace while ye have layser / to set her up again. Be now
no sluggardes in your holy water making / nor yet in your sensynges and

apply ye apace / and se there be found in ye no slackenesse.

3 The precyouse worthynesse of things (...) out by your Egypciall generacyon

yt is honorable ware and worthy to have soche a Poet for y^ author. It is no
maruele though these new books now a days be things nothing worth. For they
bring neither tithes nor offerynges / deuocyo^s nor tre^tals / purgatory pens
nor pyssages. There are more sweet profyghtes to be pycked out of one Sarum
mass book / than out of them all: yea / God save Sermones discipuli / with the

when they were used / than yt is now a days. It was a good world with prestes /
when they stodyed nothing else but fryre Albert de secretis mulieru^ / and to
fatche in their tithes and other profyghtes. Long was ^t ere Johan Mayor in
Paris a great learned manne / could prove by natural reason and by the
scripturs that watchyng spretes might begett women with child / as one of them
ded the no^ne of wales that was Marlynes mother: Was not this think you a good
virtuous stodye and sumwhat worth / when it was ones brought to light: They
have set forth many of these good works / like good virtuous fathers and
profitable workmen / yet has few or non found sawte in them.

4 Sumwhat means Pantolabus here by this heresye and treason that was so
openly preached. But I trust he will discoue^ no^ of his own affynite /
though many of them were hanged for them at y^ rysynge up in the North.
Doctor Baylye in Sothfolke wroughte great miracles by sir Roger Wenforthes
dowter to auau^ce the great lady of Ippes wyche. Doctor Bockynge like wise ded
wonderful feats at Caunterberye in kent by Elyzabeth Berton to set up a new
pylgrimage at Court up street. Doctor Cronke^orne had certain reuelacio^s of a
new kyngedome that was coming upon this clause of Te Deu^ / Aperuisti
crede^tibus regna celoru^. And preached the^ in diverse towns of Easisexe as
y^ monasteryes were in suppressynge / by y^ virtue of this text. Tempus faci^^di
domine / dissipaueru^t legem tu^. It is time lord to stir about y^. For if
thu tarrye much longar / y^ heretyques will mar all. Doctor Pyckerynge and
other prelates ded little other for.2. years space / but move the prest^s of
the North to provoke y^ people in their lent confessyons to the pylgrimage of
grace against y^ king and his counsel. Besides y^ propre feats that were
done by doctor Macketell / y^ vycar of Lowthe / Reynoldus of Shene / y^
charterouse monks / y^ obseruau^t friars and diverse other that were hanged
and quartered. But these will not Pantolabus accuse for preachers of heresye
and treason / because their doctrine does please him well / and specyallye
because y^ pope has newly canonysed the^ for his saints.

A mysterye.

no pyth. 3 Of learning nor vvytt Not vvorth a nytt. 4. Via stulti recta in
oculis eius. psalm. 12.
The openinge. 1.
NOt one of these scysmatiques before rehearsed / could Pantolabus find in his
heart to appoint out for a captain. yet were they of a false sedicyouse train
both of heresye and treason / as his self is yet s^yll with other of that
affynite. The lord Datsye was in those days a mighty great captain. So was
the lord Husseye. So were sir Robert Constable / sir Thomas Percye / sir Johan
Bulmer / sir Steven Hamerton / sir George Lumlaye / with Rafe Bulmet / Nycolas
Tempest / and a great sort more. Robert Ask was in that pylgrimage of grace
for y^ Popes holy church no small doar / though he had but one eye. No More
was captain Cobbler / that valeau^t George on horse back with his Lyncolne
shere bows and baggepypes: yet are they not found fytt to occupye a rome in
this noble Genealogye. Many spiritual captains also and wise counselors
were at the same self time very busye to promote that ghostlye quarrel
for^warde. As James Locherell the prior of Gysburgh / Wyllyam Wytlesse the
prior of Brydlyngton / Adam Sedbar Abbot of Garbeleye / Wyllyam Thyrske abbot
of Fenleye the abbot of Oborne / the abbot of Sawleye / the abbot of Whawleye /
the abbot of Glasten^erye / the abbot of Redynge / the abbot of Lolchestre /
and the prior of Lenton not far from Nothyngham. Besides that was done at
Walsyngham in Northfolke / by sir Nycolas Mylam a Chanon / George Gysborow
fryre Peckoc / and other more. But all these captains were out of Pantolabus
remembrance at this time.

2 Only is poor Johan Frith a captain sound out here to his purpose /
because he was to the Pope a capital enemy. Though Pantolabus be but a fool /
he knows what he wotteth well enough. I warande you he has no worse opinyon
of all these former captains / than has the holy father of Rome. That is to
say / though they were byheaded / hanged / and quartered / yet dyed they full
virtuous men / as ded holy Thomas Beckett for the lybertees of holy
church. By this may ye se that yt is not all one to dye forholye church and
to dye for the Gospel. For they that dye for holy church are holy saints
and martyrs / where as they that dye for the Gospel are but heretyques and
trayters. But what this will apere in y^ latter judgment / that day shall
declare / when no worldly polycies will help. This poor young manne Johan
Frith / which is here co^tempned for the veruytees sake / may chance at that
day as the membre with y^ head / with Christ to judge y^ truths adversaries /
for following him in the same persecucyon. For an office yt is to a certain sort
belonging. But sure I am that they are not those which live here
voluptuouslye. Than must yt needs be they that suffer all wrongs here in that
verytees cause.

3 The wife man says / that they are those whom y^ world had sumtyme in
dirisyon / thinking their doctrine mad folyshnesse and their latter ends
without honor. yet are they rekened among the children of God / and their
porcyon is plentyfull among the holy saints. Of this unlearned hypocrite and
braynelesse babbler / is Johan Frith noted to be without pyth of learning and
wit Where as the contrary is known to his whole generacyon / which never
were yet able to confute his book of purgatory agenst Rastell / More / and
Rochestre / besides his other works. The veryte has yet victory at his hand
/ though he for a time be thrown under the altar / there calling for a just
reuengement of that vnpytefull violence so cruellye here ministered unto him.
What pythe of wytt and learning Pantolabus had when he wrote this Genealogy /
yt is well perseyued of them that has read yt / if they were not as he is /
all wytlesse and graceless. Scarselye worth a nytt is the best verse thereof /
to him that shall seek either wytt or learning. But as the saying is / draffe
is good enough for swyne / and dyrtye puddynges for dogs. As good as the best
is this filthy baggage for the Papists / which seeks nothing else but
errors and lies in hypocrisye.

4 In his allegacyon of scripture / Pantolabus should seem neither to be wytty
nor learned. For in both his cappyes imprinted by Johan Redman and Robert Wyer /
he notes yt to be in the.xii. Psalm of David / and yt is not there / but in
the.xii. chapter of Salomons Proverbs. There is this text in deed. Via stulti
recta in oculis eius. Look what a fool takes in hand / that thinks he only
well done. A very folyshe sight has Pantolabus in Genealogies to take y^
father for y^ son. Of a lykelyhode he dreamed that he was at Mattens when he
was at mass / by taking of David for Solomon By the orderyng of his scripturs
/ he seems better learned in his portas or Mass book / than in the sacred
Bible. No where had that text been better bestowed / than upon his own
precyouse body / if he had seane himself ryghtlye. For by his shadow we may
trace out an ydyote / much more by his person / and most of all by his
doltyshe doctrine here ministered. In the same chapter is this text also: verte
impios and non erunt / domus ^ustorum permanebit. Turn over the wicked / and
they are no more seane / but the building of the ryghtouse shall never perish.
Frith shall be commended for his godly wisdom / when Pantolabus shall be
reputed a presumptuouse fool. Abominable are deceytfull lyppes before the Lord
/ but they that labor for the truth does please him greatly.

A mysterye.
1 He did say plain There ded not remain. 2 Rya^^ye present In the blessed
sacrament. 3 Os iusti pascitur imperitia. Pro. 15.
The openinge. 1.
ODyouse unto Pantolabus is Johan Frith above all other / and that apereth by
this. Though he has before here accused Wyclef / Husse / Luther / Melanchton /
Oecolampadius / and zwinglius for heretyques / yet has he laid against them
non artycles of heresye. But now in a great fume he lays to Johan Frithes
charge the sacrament of the aultre / and that with no small circumstau^ce.
Many men thinks that this hot enterprise of his / is more for the loss
that he and soche other has sustained in dyrge pens / soul grotes / mass
offerynges / tre^tals / monthmyndes / yearmyndes / and soche like / than for
any other de^^ryon. That is the comberouse colly^k that pangeth him and his
generacyon daily at the very heart ro^e / and that makes them so malancholye
/ mad / and modye against heretyques. They are not contented that Johan Frith
was so plain in his wrytynges concerning that matter / wherein all their
commodyte and profyghtes lies enclosed. Had he meddled with any other thing
else / he had not so fore displeased them. For if that ones were taken away /
small substance would remain unto them / toward their spiritual
mayntenaunce in pride / whoredom / slouthe / ydelnesse / gluttony / buggerye
and soch other beastlye fruits of their vn^cyons and shauynges.

2 Wonderfullye have they busyed themselves to hold up that building of
theirs. That holy Mass or sacrifice for the quyeke and the dead / patched
together by so many holy Popes / with so many ceremonies dysgysynges /
syghtes / instruments / gy^nes / legerdemaynes / turnynges / beckynges /
dreamynges / dottynges / mowynges / gapynges / breathynges with ho he have at
all / cryenges / crossynges / doppynges / dossynges / blessings / breakynges /
de^owrynges / syppynges / rynsynges / thombe lyckynges / and many other toys
besides. All their wits / labor / disygence / and stodye have they with
Demetrius occupied / to prepare strong bulwerkes for this shryne of Dyana.
Afterthat their Pope had ones optayned of Phocas the false emprour to be head
of y^ church. By the craftye practyses of the monks / Paschasius / Berno /
Guido / Humbertus / Gulmundus / Algerus / Rogerus / Lanfrancus / Ans^lmus / and
soche other / was realyte adjoined to the sacrament. Than were vnyuersytees
founded every where by monks also to uphold that new builded butteras. Than
stood forth Peter the Lombarde or the Master of their sentences / which was
begotten / bredde / and borne of an holy whore / a nonne I should say / under
the sacred vow of chastyte / and he gave unto yt transubstanciacyon. Than
followed transmutacyon / transicyon / and transaccidentacyon / but not
transsyguracyon yet to this day.

Than ded Pope Innocent the.iii. of that name make yt Accidens sine subiecto /
Thomas of Aq^yne supporting that doctrine by his doltyshe diuynite. Johan
Paris and other would have added unto yt Impanacyon of y^ word / but that was
rejected anon for dangers thereupon ensewynge. After that came in ydemptyte /
realyte / formalyte / materyalyte / propryete / veracyte / absolute being /
multiplicacyon / union / diffynitacyon / essenciacyon / vbiquite fyguralite /
symbolycalite / naturalyte / potencialite / personalyte / presencialyte /
proporcionalite / perticipalite / habitualite / virtualite / dymencionalite /
substancialite / deificalite / carnalite corporalite / modalite / supposytalite
/ ypostaticalite / and a great sort more among their Sentencioners and
Scolistes. Than was y^ boxed / pyxed / and tabernacled / and so borne forth in
processyon with torche / light / banner / cross / candels^yck / cope / and
canape / with knelynge and crowchynge / many wonderful miracles following /
as was seane at Lynos / Paris / Calys / Brucels / Schiedam / and in many other
places else. And so was yt clerelye altered from Christ's institucyon / and
became throughlye the abominacyon of desolacyon / as witnesses Johan Wyclef in
his.iii. chapter de Eucharistia. Than had the bisshoppes at their hands their
Sophisters and Summystes / their Sente^cyoners and Canonistes with all
supers^iciouse subtyltees to defend yt for a blessed sacrament. And when that
lowsye learning would not serve them / than had they upon their sides to
dispute with against y^ heretyques / both sweedes and halters / fire and
faggottes / as they have yet still to this hour.

3 I would that the text which Pantolabus brings in here out of Salomons
Proverbs / to prove that Christ's body is reallye present in the blessed
sacrament / were dilygentlye marked of the reader. It is not these / De stusti
pascitur imperitia / as Pantol^bus has here laid it forth. But it is in that
xv. chapter. De stultorum pascetur imper^tia / if ye take their old text. The
mouth of fools shall befedde with all folyshnesse. Of a lykelyhode Pantolabus
has some priuylege of the Pope / that he may at his pleasur pervert the
scripturs in the defense of holy church. yet proves not this perverted text
that Christ is reallye present in the sacrament. But in deed it declares what
Pantolabus is / both reallye / naturallye / formallye / and substanciallye /
and so does in a manner all the whole chapter besides. Sone after the beginning
thereof / is soche an other: like clause. De fatuorum ebullit stultitiam. The
mouth of lewd fools boyleth out folyshe bablynges / as are the Poetical
verses of Pantolabus book here / and all the ynke horn terms also of their
doctors before rehearsed here for their blessed sacrament. More fytlye had this
clause of the same chapter been applied to that sacrament as it is now used.
Victime impiorum abominabiles Domino. Abominable to y^ Lord are the
sacrifyces of the wicked / where as the prayer of the ryghtouse is acceptable.
Filthy is the way of the ungodly / but he that follows ryghtousnesse is in
Gods fauer. For why y^ ceremonies thereof are the Popes and not his. The
brekefast is the prestes alone / and no communyon of Christ's people to knytt
them up together as members into his mystical body.

A mysterye.
1 The flesh and blood And lyuelye food. 2 And only vvelthe Of our soul
health. 3 Qul manducat hunc panem, viuet in aeternum. Joan. 6.
The openinge. 1.
PRoudelye still pratleth this popish Poet / accusynge Johan Frith for not
grau^tynge Christ's real presence in their sacrament. And here he co^uerteth
his fantasyed realyte into Christ's flesh and blood / calling it the lyuelye
fode of y^ soul Godly wise was Johan Frith / and so shall he find it in the
latter day / in that he would not attribute unto Christ that thing / with is
not found in y^ scripturs. A popish lyuerye is that realite of theirs /
sophisticallye borrowed of Aristotle's logyck. He would in no case be accursed
of the mouth of God for adding soche beggerye to his word. Rather ded he
(good creature) offer his body to the fire. I think not the contrary of
I^han Frith / but if their sacrament had been Christ's as it is the Popes / in
the colors it is in now / he had granted unto it much more than he ded.
Christ's flesh is no soche pouetrye / nor his blood soche ma^metrye / as their
mangye miracles has made it. For if their corruptyble bread were that lyuelye
fode of soul / than had all they peryshed / which has not so outwardlye
received it before time. As Adam / Noe / Abraham / Moses / David / Helias /
with all the other fathers which dyed before Christ. They received both his
body and blood / else had they not been saved. For saint Paul does say that
all they and we have eaten of one spiritual meat and dro^cke of one
spiritual drink / one hard rock ministrynge it unto ve both. In sprete and
veryte (says Christ) shall the true worshippers worship him / and not in
outward things that are seane with the eye / for they remain only to the
false worshippers or ydolaters.

2 Neither have your Realyte power to make your blessed sacrament Christ's
flesh nor yet his blood. Neither can ye thereby prove it our lyuelye food nor
yet our ^owles health / though ye a thousand times put it thereunto. For so
much as it comes not from y^ express word of God / but from the filthy
doctrine of your Philosophers / which were non other but filthy ydolaters.
Rathe^ should it seem therefore to convert it into an ydoll to our sowles
destruccyon / than into Christ's flesh to our sowles co^solacyon. A lyuelye
fode it may well be unto you which are fed therewith daily at your austers
/ but well I wot in that kind it is non unto us in y^ churches body which
have no part thereof. An only welthe it may be unto your generacyon which
take the sweet profytes thereof / and lives thereby in all boluptuouse pleasurs
of ydelnesse. But how it should be the health of your sowles in that kind of
clowtynge / that can I not well tell you. Well I wot it is neither welthe nor
health unto us. For a great undoing has it been to the comonwelthe / and is
yet a most ruynouse decay of the peples soul health / the eternal father
redressel it. ye will say parauenture ye make it Christ's flesh by the
speaking of his word unto it Christ never taught you to preach his word in
a foren language to a thing that is dumme / but to the living people in their
natyue language / that they might believe and be saved. He bad you distribute
that bread unto other / and not to slaffe it up your selves. He commanded
also the people to eat it / but in no case to worship it. Never was it
worshipped in the church / till it had your Realyte / which Christ never
granted to your breathynge.

3 The scripture that is here alleged out of the sixth of Johan. Qui manducat
hunc panem / viuet in eternum / condempneth the whole doctrine of Pantolabus
mad meters here / both by the sequel of the same chap. and also by the
opynion of all the old doctors which names it a spiritual eating. In all
that process does Christ reprove the Capernaytes or carnal hearers of his
word / requirynge a believe of them that will be saved. For at that time nor
yet of a year after was not that holy supper of his instituted. Christ there
admonished both his own disciples and y^ Capernaytes not to labor for the
meat that perishes with the bellye / but for that which endures into the
life everlasting which is his eternal word. And when they grodged at his
heaueulye aduertysementes / he declared unto them what he meant by that eating
/ fayeng. Qui credit in me / habet vitam eternam. He that believes on me / has
the life everlasting. As who should say / that there to eat / is to believe
according to his word. When Christ after that he had declared himself to be
the bread of life / and that his flesh was meat and his blood very drink
/ and that they which ded eat him should live for ever. He gave them this for a
full co^clusyon of the understanding of that eating and drinckynge. Spiritus
est qui vi^ificat / caro non prodest quicqua^. It is only the sprete that
quyckeneth / the carnal eating profyteth nothing at all. For the bisshoppes
beheld him / Judas ded kiss him / and the cruel Jews towched his body /
yet were they for that never the better. No More than the prestes are yet to
this hour / which (as they say) do daily receive him with their mouth /
eat him with their lyppes / and tear him with their teathe.

A mysterye.
1 O braynelesse nodye Christ said my body 2 Is verelye meat For manne to
eat. 3 Caro mea vere est cibus, etc. Joan. 6.
The openinge. 1.
QVycke is Pantolabus in his matters now / and quauereth in his quybybles at
large. He cutteth his crotchettes as short as chyldes dyrt / that they should
tonne round on his tongue. Now is Johan Frith a braynelesse nodye / because he
has not written to his mind. But what a wytlesse wrangeler is he / and a
dodypoll dawe pat^ / that thus will talk with a dead manner. A common custom
is it among the unlearned papists / only to inueye against them that are
gone. Never will they meddle with them which are alive / unless they be sure
to burn them or to hang them. Truth it is that Christ has said / that his
body is meat / and that he which does not receive that meat ca^ have no life
in him. But what that eating is can not Pantolabus tell / or at y^ last he
has not yet taught it. Christ says that to eat his flesh and to drink
his blood / is to dwell in him by faith and love / and he again to dwell in us
by his sprete of veryte / and not to hear your popish mass or to receive
your sacrament. An infynite nombre of people have thus eaten him and droncke
him / which never knew what your massynge or how selling meant / and shall
live perpetuallye in that refeccyon. Not one ever perished that so has
received him / where as thousands has been lost that has been fed at your
aulters.

2 Whereas his flesh is eaten and surely dygested / there is seane no more
whoremongynge / theft / fornicacyon / ydelnesse / wytchecraft / cruelte /
spyght / covetousness / ydolatrye / hatred / glotonye / and other filthy
vices of the flesh. But love / joy / peace / patience / long sufferynge /
gentylnesse / goodness / faythfulnesse / meekness / clennesse / temperaunce /
with other fruits of the sprete. It is not your oyled generacyon therefore /
nor yet they that are howseled at their masses that eats Christ's flesh and
drynketh his blood / which for the more part still remain whoremongers /
buggerers / robbers / cloyners / catchers / false teachers / hypocrites /
ydolaters / trayters / deceyuers / bellye gods / extorcy^ners / murderers of
sowles / and burnets of innocents for their true Christen believe. Where as
Christ is eaten / he dwells. And whereas he dwells / he will suffer no
soche works to be done. That person can be no blasphemouse babbler / no
instructour of lies / no dysdayner of Gods word / no peruetter of y^ scripturs
/ as Pantolabus is here through out all his jest. He shall not judge that to
be whyghte that is black / nor yet that is black to be whyght. But his sight
shall be soche by the gift of his sprete / that the thing which is naught he
shall so discern it / has it never so many gloryouse glytterynge colors to
the contrary.

3 As Pantolabus is in his poesyes / so is he in his allegacyons of the
scripture / a very unlearned ydyote / applyenge them both to his folyshe
fleshlye purpose. He thinks with Caromea vere est cibus / to prove that
Christ's flesh is reallye present in their popyshe sacrament. And Christ
means nothyngelesse in that whole chapter. He says not there my flesh shall
be naturallye present in your sacrament / when ye have ones provided your
oyled officers and consecrate coniurers for that purpose. But my flesh is
meat / and my blood is unfeignedly drink / before there were any soche
^wlyshe orders. He promised nor to dwell in that / but to dwell in us evermore.
The kyngedome of God (says he) comes not with outward obseruacyon of lo here
/ and se there. For behold the kingdom of God is within you. your members
(says saint Paul) are the temple of God / and your sowles the habitacles of
the holy ghost. It follows in that Gospel hic est panis qui de celo
descendit. He is the bread which came from heaven / and not that bread which
came from the wafer backers or from the breathyng of sir Laurence Loyterer at
the altar. The work of God is only to believe / and not to fatche that bread
at your ydell hands. They dye that eat your bread / and run headlynges
to the devil a great sort of them / as ded many of the Jews that eat Manna
in the desert. But they that eat this bread shall never perish.

RIallye still ruffleth this rutter in his ragged rymes of rustycall rudeness.
He reasons here his matter full clarkelye with this dead manne / why he set
his pen to b^oke aganyst the profitable wares of their markett. But so long
as he was alive he would not meddle with him. Like a valeau^t warryour of the
Popes army / he thinks the victory sone gotten of him that is gone away.
The manne alredye overthrown / is sone beatten. But let him not think so to win any great worship at Johan Frithes hand. For though his corpse be dead
/ his sprete is alive. When his flesh was in burning / his faith was most
quycke / the veryte in him remaining inuincyble. The power of hell with the
whole swarm of Antichrist shall never pre^ayle against that strong buysdynge.
Non other victory have ye / than had Cayphas over Christ / and the devil over
Job / tryumphe ye never so fast. ye may ponnyshe the body and give it to
death / but over the soul ye have no power. Blessed is that ma^ne that ever he
was borne / which perseuereth faithful to the end / as Johan Frith has done.
That he penned by his life concerning the sacrament and their popyshe
purgatory / is not greatly hyndred here as yet o^y Pantolabus dyrtye darts.
The greatest act he has done / is that he has here painted us out a fool of
himself.

2 Here is it laid unto Johan Frithes charge / that he should deny Christ's
words / because he would not in his book admyt Aristotle's realyte in their
sacrament. In deed he never denied Christ's word / for than he should have
done as you do always / and so have denied Christ himself which is all one
with his word. He evermore affermed that Christ's flesh was very meat and
his blood very drink / but not for the body. yet denied he not the
corporal eating. He granted also that he was very bread / and that he which
eats that bread shall live for ever. yet would he not have that bread which
came from the waffer backers / to be all one with that bread which came from
heaven. For saint Augustine says that their eatynges be diverse. The one is
eaten with the mouth / the other with y^ faith. The one with the lyppes / the
other with the heart. The one with the body / the other with the soul. He
would in no case have them to come in both at one door. your ^ordes would not
Frith afferme / because they are not Christ's but Aristotle's. your ways are
all after the Master of your sentences / which was in an whoryshe nonne a
filthy fruit of your vowed chastyte. ye follow in your faith the fore steps
of Bonauenture / Thomas / Dons / Osbert / Albert / Baconthorpe / Gerarde /
Gyles / Gandauus / Guido / Ockham Helyoth / Holcoth / Brulifer / Dorbel / and
other dyrtye diuynes forth yssuynge from him (in whom satan has wrought ever
sens he was set at large) refusing the Apostles doctrine. And that caused
Johan Frith never to agree unto you.

3 His reasons are never the worse that your pylde popyshe brain do not
allow them. Peuysh enough are your poesyes / and more peuyshe a great deal
your pylde wits. What your reasons are / it is plain to all them / which
has either wytt or learning. The value of them is sone rekened now that they
are come to y^ towche stone. I think verelye they are neither worth two
peasons / nor yet worth two nyttes or antes eggs. The reasons and auctorytees
of Johan Frith concerning Christ's body and blood / stands yet vntowched
for all you. Much more vndischarged. It is enough for you to rail and to
prate / to brag and to lie / though ye do nothing else. ye fare like a
gargull in a wall with a spowte in his mouth / which does nothing else but
spewe out water. ye set a great face here upon the matter / as though the
Popes church were holden up by you / and nothing do ye at all but vomete
filthy swyllynges. More like are you and a sort of your fellawes more / to
pull down your holy mother / than to keep her up long / if ye have no
better learning than ye show here. Johan Wyclef prophesied that your church
should have an end / had veryte ones the victory. Which is in short space like
to be found true / if ye plye not your matters apace.

4 Disdaynefullye cast ye it in Johan Frithes teathe here / that he dyed in the
fire at ^ procureme^t of your prelates. As though it were a great ignominye to
dye for the Lords veryte. But precyouse in y^ sight of that lord was the
death of that faithful young manne / though it were very wretched in your
syghtes regarding nothing but that which is pleasant to the flesh. What
your end shall be / the Lord of heaven knows. ye have yet layser enough to
play the field bishop / and to bless with your heles in an hempen cord /
as a great sort of your fellawes have done which were as true men as you are
here. Therefore ye are not wise to disdain any mannys end / nor yet to judge
him ill that departs in Christ's faith. ye may well know that Christ's
death was not very precyouse to your proud predecessors the bysshoppes /
pharysees / and lawers / when they went up and down there mocking and mowynge
as you do now here with your meters. No better is the servant than his master
/ nor yet the disciple than he that sent him. Full unlike is y^ sight of god to
your sight / and his ins^rutable judgments to your carnal judgments.
Blessed is Johan Frith that he suffers still at your hands these obprobryes
for his holy names sake / for sure is he of the kyngedome of heaven.

5 The clause that ye have here ins^pientlye raught out of the last chapter of
S^pience / to make good with it your malicyouse meters against Johan Frith /
will not Sapience allow now for his / ye have so disuygured yt. If ye had
gentyllye borrowed it / and not so theuishlye stolen it / he would gladlye have
received it of you again. But now it is your own ragged stuff and not his.
He has there / Just patieba^tur secundum suas nequitias / and not patiebatur.
The Egypcyanes (says he) which cruellye persecuted the chosen people of God
under Pharao / has worthelye sufferd according to their many fold
wyckednesses. He is not contented with you nor yet with soche other false
Prophets as will so preposterouslye bestow his scripturs / as to give that to
gods fryndes which belongs to his enemies. In the end of that chapter is

a spiritual name / your church is called Sodoma and Egyptus. For there ye
daily crucifye the Lord in his members / besides that ye do in your daily
Masses / or new found sacrifices for the quycke and the dead.

SEryouslye has Pantolabus sought his wits here / to clowte up his
Genealogy with sumwhat. But I maruele much that for.v. years space betwixt
the burnynges of Johan Frith and Johan Lambert / he could find out non else for
his purpose. His bloodye generacyon of mytred mahoundes and their shaven
sergeau^tes / were not wont to be so long unoccupied. His holy mother (whom
saint Johan reports to be droncke in the blood of martyrs) was not wont to
fast so long from that drink / but would cool her hot thirst ere that time
/ having so fyerye a stomach / well I wot that many than suffered at London /
Colchestre / Hadleye / Ippeswyck / Norwyche / Lynne / and in other more places
of England. Good Wyllya^ Tyndale was done to death also at Vylforde in Braban
within the same years / by the procurement of your craftye Cayphases / in the
year of our Lord a M. V. and.xxxv. in the month of Septembre And therefore I
wondre they escaped your hand. This makes us to think that ye intended of
these only with those that here follows to jest at your pleasure / upon
soche malice as ye had against them conceived. Sure are you to be of soche a
sect / as will work little goodness. Let men suspect of you what they
will / but these popyshe poesyes of yours smell knauyshlye / when ye can find
out non other heretyques but these alone / of so many Popes / poyseners /
trayters / sorcerers / Sodomites / scysmatyques / and pestylent papists as
has been / and are yet still to this day.

2 Because ye are here in hand with Lambert / I will say sumwhat for him /
for I knew his co^uersacyon. The truth of it is / he was sumtyme a pressed of
your generacyon / called sir Johan Nycols / and was borne in the cite of
Norwyche. After that he had in Cambryge given himself to good letters / and
became sumwhat expert both in the Latyne and the Greek / at the preachynges of
the good men Arthure and Bylneye / he took repentance of his former life.
And after that the king by his lawful officers had taken of him an oath to
renounce the Pope as a false usurper / he threw from him that Antichrists
yoke with his lyuerye and mark to show himself throughlye obedient Than
leauyng papistycall customs / he enbraced the Gospel for his lyfes direccyon
/ and lived otherafter a virtuous Christen life / which you judge here a life
pervert / soche is your own English term. This would I not write so
manyfestlye / if I knew it not for a certente. Where as he was before an ydell
Massemonger and an hater of the scripturs / he became than a fauorer and
follower of them. yea / he taught them unto other and lived his self according
to the same. Many Christen instruccyons wrote he to his brethren / and
brought up their children in all virtue. Diverse works of Erasm^s / and of
other good authors more / translated he into the vulgar English tongue to the
Christen commodyte of other.

3 And whereas Pantolabus writes him here to be a man almost wood / for
that he was not in faith and opinyon to his folyshe mind agreeable. He
declares himself to be of like judgment with those relygyouse curates of the
Jews Synagoge / which reported Johan Baptist to be a mad manne for his
abstinence / and Christ to be a dronckarde for his good felyship keeping. But
let him not think easlye to avoid this slaunderouse report before the
eternal judge / unless he repent in time. What so ever thu art (says saint
Paul) that iudgest an other / this shall thu be sure of forthyne own part /
to condemn thyselfe / perfourmynge the same self things that thu condemnest
him of. Much more than / if it be left in writing / as this outragyouse
slaundre is / that he was a man pervert and almost wood. Though I and soche
other which have read over Pantolabus jest here / ded not judge him a fellawe
of a perverse opinyon and doctrine / and a Bedlem beast more than mad / the
said jest it self would do it for us. Therefore let him not say that we judge
him again here / for his own filthy fruits declares him. How abhomynably
the scripturs are here perverted for a trayterouse popyshe purpose / to uphold
the filthy kyngedome of Antichrist / it will be euydent to him that shall
search the places.

4 Now comes here one in / borrowed of y^ first chapter of saint Paul to the
Romans Mark the good workemanlye handelynge (I pray ye) thereof. Sicut non
probauerunt (says he) hab ere Deum in notitia / tradidit ^llos Deus in
reprobrum sensum. As they have not regarded to know their lord god / so has
he given them over into a lewd mind. And what is this text to the purpose to
prove that Johan Lambert was a man pervert and almost wood? This is there a
conclusyon of an old stynkynge matter of yours going but a little before / and
therefore let it not be left so cowardlye behind you. Relicto naturali vsu
femine / exarserunt in desyderiis suis in inuicem / masculi in masculos
turpitudinem opera^tes. They which have vnrightouslye with holden the truth of
the lord in vnrightousnesse / leauinge y^ natural use of women / have burned
in lusts among themselves / workinge men with men unspeakable fylthynesse.
Be ashamed wretches / be ashamed / and bestow ones the scripturs whereas they
should be bestowed. Learn to amend yowr abominable lyuinge / and leave to
blaspheme the poor innoce^tes by them. For if ye can no rightlyar bestow them
/ truly if yowr wrytinges come to owr hands / we shall teach you the right
way / because yowr own shepeherdes are slack.

A mysterye.
1 Which would make good. With tongue and pen. Before all men. 2 That in
the Mass. Nothing else was. 3 But a signifycacion. Of Christ's passion. 4 Ne
sis sapiens a pud te ipsum. Prou. 1.
The openinge. 1.
THough this verse agrees with his other fellawe in sownde / yet does he not
agree with him in matter / and therefore I have disseuered them. It is not all one
to be wood or mad and to do good / and therefore I have put the good doer from
the mad. Pantolabus says here that Lambert would make. Than is he much
better by his own report than is his holy generacyon / for they have ever
marred* yea / farthermor he says that he would make good. He cannot so report
of his own monstruouse mustre / for they have made all things evil. No^ one
thing is there under the heavens / that they have not defiled with one kind
of Idolatrye or other. Besides their hypocresye whoredom / Idelnesse /
buggerye / and the devil and all of soche vices / their shameful abhorringe of
marryage / their superstic^ouse forbyddynge of meats / and their abominable
perverting of the scripturs with their sophistrye / sorcerye / wyles /
wytchecraftes / decrees / decretals / acts / clementynes / extrauagantes /
pryuileges / bulls / and provincial synodals / making plain merchandyce
both of the bodies and sowles of men. This have they done before all men
both with tunge and pen / like as Pantolabus here reports of Lambert.

2 I wist well this goodness had a tail which at the latter end would not
seem very good. Lambert both with tunge and pen was a contynuall aduersarye
to their holy Mass / which is their princypall market / and that is the cause
that he is here regestred for an heretyq^^ yea / marrye set / now understand
the matter much better than I could before. Now can I tell you what heresye is
as ye take it / and who be the heretyques that you mean. Not they that speak
against the father of heaven with Sabellius and Arrius. Nor they that blaspheme
y^ son with Porphirius and Photinus / Nor yet they which impugn the holy
ghost with Macedonius and Eunomius. But they only which replye against yowr
Mass / made by so many holy Popes. They poor sowles are alone in this yowr
Genealogye / and non other heretyques else. By this we perscyue that ye are
those ill stewardes who^ saint Paul speaks of / that seek yowr own and not
Jesus Christ's / making of yowr bellyes your God. yowr vain glory (says he)
will be yowr confusion / for nothing ye sauer but that which is earthlye. What
is yowr Mass else but a gawdishe fopperye or a toye of yowr own ymaginacyon?
No More is it like the holy supper of Christ / than y^ earth is like heaven or
filthy dyrt like gold. No / make of it the best ye ca^ne with your lyghtes /
vestymentes / copes / Jewels / aultres / Images / organes / prycksonge /
sensynges / and the devil and all / as y^ paganes ded in their old sacrifices
before their Idols.

3 If Lambert granted you that in yowr Mass so patched and peced with
papystrye was a synifycacion of Christ's death / ye were much to blame so to
burn him. For he granted you more than any ma^ne will do else / that is
godly wise and learned. But surely he never granted that to yowr Mass / but
to the most holy supper of the lord / and therefore ye have mysvnderstande his
saynges. In yowr Mass is nothing but that ye make yowrselues by the virtue of
Arystotles realyte. No / though ye.vii. times breathe over it / Hoc est corpus
meum. For christ is never made but in us / and that is by the virtue of his
word truly taught. And that is the cause that Saint Paul ded say. So often as
ye shall eat this bread and drink of this cup / ye shall show the lords
death till he come. When Christ badde ye do it in his remembrance he badde ye
not make him again. The trayuelynge woman which is with child in the
Apocalypse / betokens Christ's people / having him within them and not
without them. More over David says that the bewtyfull dowter of y^ king is
all from within. yowr Mass mongers turn their tails to the people and
preach to the wall as Antichrist has thaught them / but never turn they to
them declaringe the true meaning thereof / as Christ has commanded. And
therefore their filthy sacrifyces are Antichrists and not Christ's and that they
make there is an Idol and no God / and therefore unmeet to be worshipped. They
shall arise in the morninge (says the lord) and not find me / they shall call
unto me when I shall not hear them / and when they hold up their polluted
hands / I shall turn away my face.

4 Nothing to the purpose is this allegacyon of Salomons Proverbs. ^esis
sapiens apud temetipsum. To prove that the Mass is sumwhat more than a
signifycacyon of Christ's passion. And again y^ text is falselye placed / for
it is not in y^ first chapter / but in the.iii. This craftye co^ueyaunce of
yours / is to play boo pepe with the simple people. ye ruffle out your
scripturs / but when men shall seek them / they shall be sure not to find
them where you appoint them / least they should with them find out also your
iuglynges. This is now the.iii. time ye have played this towche / let your
conueyau^ce be sumwhat cleaner. If ye lay that text unto Lambertes charge /
that he was to wise in his own conceyt / ye do him much wrong / for that
co^cept is yours and not his. you have for that folyshe conceyt of yours /
putta side all the wisdom of God. Utterly despise you Christ's institucyon /
accountynge him / but an ydyote fool that could not make soche solemn
preparacio^s as ye have made. Full little considered you in the same self
chapter. Quod abominatio Domino est omnis illusor / and cum simplicibus
sermocinatio eius. Abominable to the Lord is e^eye disdaynefull scorner /
where as the simple disdayned shall know his secret counsels. The mocker will
he lawgh to scorn / and yet will he give his grace to the lowlye. The wise
shall possess his glory / and the bragging of foles / confusyon.

The openinge. 1.
UErelye these poesyes are strange and diverse. They make me to remember the
processyon of Maydston in kent. For some of them daunse like great gyauntes
and are eight syllabes a piece. As this verse here before. But a significacyon.
Some come doppynge after like little hoppe on my thombes / and are but.iiii.
syllabes as. And utterly / with his fellawe as short as he. And therefore it is
but mad gere. But what is it (I pray you) that Lambert ded deny? That
Christ was his Lord. No verelye ded he not / but stood stedefastlye by it unto
the very death / that he was his only sauer / peacemaker / health /
ryghtuousnesse / and redemer. He alone was the lamb that dyed for him. And he
alone was y^ head of that church that he was a membre of. In this faith
perseuered he unto his latter end / and in the same departed unto his lord
God. yet sought your generation by most turkyshe tyranny to compel him to
remove his foot from that rock. But merciful was that lord unto him. In the
mids of the fire denied not he his veryte / but departed hence with the clear
victory over you. Non of the Popes sworn subjects dyed he / but the very
true servant of Jesus Christ.

2 His denial was in deed that Christ should be contained in the bankett of
your blessing. Remember first from whens your blessings come / and out of
whose auctorite they sprange first of all. Saint Johan says in the Apocalypse
that the Dragon (ye wot whom he means) gave his auctoryte / seat / and
power unto the great Beast that arose out of the sea. And in an other chapter
following he says also / that y^ worldly governors / as emprours / kings /
and princes / should apply their strengthes (which consists in their laws /
swerdes / and scepturs) unto the same filthy freke. Of this Beast have you
that mark wherewith ye bye and sell. your ^yles and shauynges are not of
Christ no more are your myters and typpettes. If he would have sent forth soche
minysters / he neded to have gone no farther than to Annas and Cayphas /
Ioa^n^s and Alexander / with other of y^ same affynite / for they were of a
kyndred provided of God to soche offices of externe obseruacions / but yet not
to make new gods nor yet to sense images. your uncommanded exorcysmes and
blessings are non other than the plain practyses of Necromancye. By the virtue
whereof / though ye may with your Pope fatche the devil from hell (for your
sacrifices are all one) yet can ye not draw the son of God out of heaven and
so make our creed of non effect.

3 yet can ye not out of your ragged realyte / borrowed of the Paganes learning
/ for ^ant of scripturs to your mind. There will ye have him to be reallye /
only when ye shall command him. That is to say / that the thing there in
sight made of flower and water / is very he in deed by the virtue of your
office. ye will have him there also substanciallye in his own propre person /
in length and in breadethe / in form^ and proporcion / with flesh / blood /
skin / bones / hear / tethe / and nails. ye are very conning work men
that ye can do so much in so little time and with so few words. But ye can
not tell us whether he sytteth or stands / lawgheth or wepeth. I think
verelye he might weep in deed if that natural affect were now still regnynge
in his glorified body / like as he sumtyme wept upon Jerusalem / to se his
dear heryta^e so wretchedlye abused of you. I can not / but much maruele that
ye require so great honor to those wares of yowr making / and so little
worshipp to the eternal testament of Jesus Christ. Why hold ye not up that
everlasting treasure before the people? Why tell ye the^ not that he is
therein both reallye and sus^anciallye contained? No / ye will non thereof. For
it is neither to yowr spiritual commodite nor yet auau^^age. ye will cruellye
persecute it and blaspheme it making the people to believe that it is most
detestable heresye.

4. yowr text here of / Quocies^unque ma^ducabitis panem hune / et calicem
bibetis and c. is nothing at all upon yowr side / but directlye against you.
So often as ye shall eat this bread (says Saint Paul) and drink of this
cup etc. Here is the communion of Christ's holy supper not called Christ him
self / but bread and drink received of christ. Much less than is yowr
waffer cake christ which you have received of the Pope. A curtal have ye made
of that text / cutting away this tail clean from his rompe / Morte^
dominianunciabitis donec veniat / least other men should know the truth of
the thing and what were the true office in that ministracion. Herin are ye
told that when ye so ^ate / ye should show the lords death till he come /
but that will ye never do. If ye mark well the same (Till he come) yowr
realite and substancialite of Christ's presen^^. there bodylye / will sone
apere nothing at all. Both here and before ye have written it ryallye with a y
in both yowr prented coppyes. If it be yowr fawte / ye are but a fool in yowr
own occupacion. If the fawte be of yowr.ii. prenters / than are both you lewd
for teachinge of them soche wytcherye as they can not understand / and they
beastlye also to believe soche blind beggerye / mynistrynge it so a broad for
money. ye off^e us here again in both yowr coppyes one chapter for an other /
and I am very glad of it. For in so doing / ye bring us to the truth of
yowr matter. In that.x. chapter is it written. Nolo autem vos socios / fieri
demonior^^ I will you in no case (says Saint Paul) to have felyshyp with
devils. ye ca^ not at ones be partakers of the lords table / and of the table
of devils. That is offered to yowr Idols is no mete refeccio^ for the
christianes. As yowr daily sacrifices are / which ye make before the Images of
yowr aulters / and not before the people of God. It should seem a far other
catinge and drinkinge that Saint Paul does mean / than this yowr morninge
brekefast is / by that which goth before there. For he says that all y^ fathers
before Christ's coming. As Adam / Noe / Abraham / Moses / David / and soche
other ded eat of one spiritual meat / though that Christ came long after /
yet had they never yowr whyght God with so many blessings.

The openinge. 1.
WOrshyplye does this Poet bestow his wits here / if ye mark him well /
flatterynglye fawnynge upon some great pyller of his church for a vaun^age /
though it be not upon his good lord of Wynchestre. A common custom is it of
these vain hypocrites and ydell wytted papists / to cloyne with all craftye
colors and ingyns possible for to crepe into the fauer of those that the
world lawheth upon. Woe be unto you false prophets (says Ezechiel) that some
pyllowes under mennys arm holes and bolsters under their heads / to catch
sowles with all for lucre. Much better (says Solomon) are the strypes of a
lover / than the frawdelent kysses of a flatterer. More profyght is it to be
chastened of a wise manne / than to be deceived by the lawhynge of foles. Soche
a false flatterer would not David regard / but commanded him straight ways
to be slain. By these flattering meters it is easy to perseyue what
Pantolabus seeks here. A benefyce of my lord to sing for butterflyes / that
the profyghtes thereof might pamper him up in all ydelnesse. And for that he
has magnyfyed his good lordeshyppe here with a lie / in reportynge him to
prove Lambert a fool in the disputacion of their sacrament / and to set him
again to scole to declyne this pronowne hoc. But I fear me they will prove
foles both / his good lord and he / ere the matter be fullye ended.

2 The diuynite of this great divine of his / will scarselye apere good
sophistrye or yet simple gramer after old Alexanders rewles / be it ones tried
by the scripturs. I think it be no better than course legerdemayne / for all
these gloriouse glauerynges. Diuinare is sumtyme to guess at a venture / and
thereupon (I suppose) he calls him here a divine / and not for any truth he
has uttered therein / or in any other godly matter else as yet. Not only is
this great pyller of holy church thus regestred here of Pantolabus in this
his genealogy of heresye / that he should be good lord unto him in an other
matter / as if a benefyce fell that he might be preferred for this his good
zele / but also his good diuynite is putt in here with him. The nature of this
dowtye diuynite is to stand much in the declynynge of pronownes / as he has
here full poeticallye described it. This was in the old time but boys play
in the gramer scoles / and now it is taken up for high diuynite in the
consistorye scoles of the papists / to prove Christ reallye and substanciallye
present in their sacrament. Like is it to be no small matter for men to be
burned for / are they have done with it / that has so substancyall proves or
arguments. Necessary is it to declyne a pronowne well / for him that will
know the mysterye thereof after their meaning. Now forsooth here is godly
Christen learning crept latelye into England for the mayntenaunce of their
new Christen believe.

3 Sumwhat must these bragging hypocrites have always to blind with the eyes
of the simple / which never seeks out their wyles. So folyshe are they that
they nothing else believe / but that they have in falsehede taught them / as the
blind with the blind so falling into the dytche. Here is it boasted of
Pa^tolabus that his good lord of Wynchestre that great divine proved lambert
an heretyque with this pronowne hoc. The sentence that Christ spoke at his last
supper among his disciples and brethren / had neither hic nor hoc / for it
was in the Hebrew speech which has neither of both. Wherefore the declynynge
of hoc makes nothing at all for the trial of any veryte therein. More to the
purpose had the comparynge or conferring of that Latin pronowne with panis or
with corpus been / than the declyn^nge thereof. That is yet all together to
folyshe. I put Wynchestre and Pantolabus the case / that the Hebrew has not
the newtre gendre / as it has not in deed. How will they tha^ with their new
divinity declyne their pronowne hoc? I think both their wits will scarselye
well serve them / having no better help tha^ themselves. Erasmus says also
in his annotacions / that this verb substantyue est / is not in the Greek
no more than it is in the Hebrew. I maruele how they would handle this matter
also if they should gra^maticallye declyne it. It is a world (they say) to
hear foles prate when they be upon their alebenche.

4 Now comes forth the text / that must make up all their market / if it be
not all together against the^ / which is to be feared. We find not in y^
Gospel neither of Matthew Mark / nor Luke / nor yet in Paul to the Corinthes
/ that Christ breathed upon y^ bread when he said / Hoc est corpus meum. For
all they make mensyon that it was out of his hands and delivered to his
Apostles before he spoke those words. Therefore that breathinge of yowrs upon the
bread / is but a new sound toye of yowr own sorcerye / to make men believe
that ye are great doers by the virtue of yowr oylinges and shauinges. He gave
thanks in deed unto God his father but the words of his thankesgeuinge (which
were the words of his consecracio^) he lest not here be hind him / soryow to
df yowr feats with. For he knew you subty^e work men. ye have always a
craftye custom (for your occupacio^ is nothing else but craft) to gelde yowr
scriptures of so much as ye think should discover you. Quod pro vobis tradetur
/ had as good place and was as well allowed in Christ's consecracion (as you
falselye take it) as had Hoc est corpus meu^. And I think verily that y^ one
declares the other after his meaning / but not after your subtle meaning for
your advantage. He called that his body that should be betrayed for the^ / now
construe you y^ rest because year so co^ning in construccio^s. By as clarkely
divinity as you do use here / a ma^ne might axe you whether ye call that hoc of
yowrs / this or that? As this is my body with sits / or that is my body
which ye have eaten. For he badde them both take and eat / and paused sumwhat
after / before he said This is my body which shall be betrayed for you.

XErxes the cruel king of the Parthyanes in his frantyck furye made proud
preparacions of.x. h^ndreth thousand soudiours against the Greeks / yet was he
at y^ latter slain but of one simple captain called Artabanus. Very like is
it to be so here with Pantolabus if he takes not head. Though he has upon his
side the Popes great army or infynite host of cardinals / Bisshoppes /
suffraganes / archedeacons / chauncellers / officials / co^missaryes / deanes /
prebendes / colligeners / doctors / bachyllers / persons / curates / prestes /

mouth overthrow him. Here scornefullye disdayneth he Johan lambert a poor
membre of his / full blockyshlye calling him a block having naught to say
(he says) when his reverend lord disputed with him / neither yea nor nay.
And I believe it well. For Lambert before had learned this wise lesson of Solomon.
Ne respo^deas stulto iuxta stulticiamsuam etc. Answer not a fool according to
his folyshnesnesse / least thu apere like to him. He considered also that his
master Jesus Christ had very few words before Annas and Cayphas / and non at
all before Herod / least he should have given that was holy to dogs and that
was preciouse unto swyne.

2 What skylleth it how dawyshe and fo^yshe you judge him which have no
judgment that is godly / whyls Christ has promised him a plentuouse reward
in heaven for that he suffers here of you. Saint Paul says that the word of
the cross is evermore judged folyshnesse to them that shall perish. But unto
them that shall be saved it is y^ power of God. In that he was judged by the
law at your procureme^t / he has that reward which his master promised him /
and that he his self had before. If they have persecuted me (says he) they
shall also persecu^e you. For no better is the scruaunt tha^ his master. If
yowr mad modye generacio^ called Christ before time / samaritane / dronkarde /
devil / heretyque / and traitor / what maruele is it though you folowinge
after in the same self fore steps call so his poor member? No less reward
has Johan Lambert (as I believe) for sufferinge yowr violence at London / than
had Antipas the faithful witness of y^ lord which was cruellye slain at
Pergamos. For that strong victory which he had over you / not being
ouercomen in his faith by the terror of death with you procured him / he has
now of his lord God that sweet Manna which is hid from the wise of this
world / and that fair whight Stone which has the new name written that no man knows save he that receives it.

3 A great sort of your shorn generation ^o ere drawn to the gallows in the
second year of king henrye the forth / and now in owr time also for
betrayenge this realm to the Pope as I have told you before / but at them ye
triumph nothing at all. Fryre Johan forest a wise prelate of yowrs was both
hanged and brent for heresye and treason / yet is he non of your Genealogye.
The marquis of E^etur / the lord Mou^tegue / sir Edward neuele / sir Adryan
foscue / and a great nombre of trayters more / suffered death openly / yet are
they not here remembered. But easy it is the cause to conjecture / for they
were your fryndes. They dyed for the lybertees of your whorishe church / as
ded your holy trayter Thomas Becket / to mainteyne ye in all pride and
voluptuousness. ye know what ye do well enough / though / ye be not all with
the godly wysest. yowr quarrel in this jest is only against heretyques /
specially against soche as has deminisshed your lyui^ges. As this Lambert was
one / whom here ye repart to be burned for heresye / not ill apayed thereof. To
them that are brent for Christ's veritees sake / remains the same crown of
rightousnesse / that remained unto Polycarpus the Bishop of Smyrna / which was
also brent for the same for when the ryghtfull judge shall come at the latter
day / that now seems right in your eyes will than apere otherwise. Nothing
shall there be decysed after your popish laws / but all according to that
word whom ye now condemn for heresye.

4 For a custom in a manner ye take it / falselye to allege your scripturs.
And to amend the matter ye have made it false Latin / whereby I judge you but
a sengle sir Johan. ye occupye here the feminyne gendre for the masculyne. I
suppose it is for some good love ye bear to that gendre out of the right
rewle. If these fawtes had been but in one of your coppyes / we might have
thought it the printers negligence. But now we are compelled to judge it your
ignorance. Confusi sunt sapientes / is not in the.iii. chapter of Hieremie /
but in the.viii. And it is there spoken of those prestes and preachers / which
ministers unto the people lyenge learning for lucre. For it follows
immediately after / Verbum enim Domini proiecerunt / and sapie^tia nulla est in
eis. The word of the Lord have they thrown at their tails / and have now no
manner of wisdom. Their rebuke (says the prophet) is open / for they do
abominable things / yet are they not ashamed. No / they will know of no
manner of shame. If this be not spoken of your filthy generation / I report me
to you. ye would feign have it serve for Frith and Lambert. As who should say:
They were confounded of your bisshoppes for all their wisdom. No / no / your
bisshoppes are confounded by them / though the worldly eyes seyth it not. And
they are departed hence with victory in the veryte.

1 Next after him Came in a lymme. 2 Of Antichrist An Anabaptyst. 3 One Peter
Frank. 4 Hi sunt fontes sine aqua, quibus caligo tenebrarum reseruatur. 2.
Pet. 2.
The openinge. 1.
YMagyne you never so many craftye colors / yet can ye not hyde a wolf. Now
couple ye these good men with the Anabaptists / y^ more to blemishe their
names / though they never agreed to that supersticyouse sect. Rather should the
Anabaptists seem to be of your sort than of theirs For they have in a manner
the same opinion of fre will / and of iustificacion by works that you have.
They will obey no temporal magistrates / and no more will you but by
compulsyon. They force not to break their oath of allegeaunce / and no more do
you. They would have all men's goods in common / and so would you also /
your own always excepted. And this foredele of them ye have in that article.
ye are sure in every man's goods to have a portion by tyttle of tithes /
offerynges / confessions / testaments / masses / and so forth / doing little
or nothing for it / and so are not they. And therefore I can not se / but ye
are a membre of theirs / as daungerouse / coyeshe / and diverse as ye make it.
Marrye in deed a zele they have unto the Gospel / though nothing to knowledge
/ which you never had yet / but a most bitter hate in the stead thereof. And
therefore ye seem rather to be lymmes of the denyll (which has been a murderer
in your spyghtfull generation ever sens the beginnynge) than of any
congregation that is godly.

2 If ye knew so well what an Antichrist were as ye can name him / ye should
here pluck your self by the nose hard. But I perseyue well now ye are but a
wytlesse fool. It is not y^ ^ebaptisynge or retynctynge again in water that
makes an Antichrist / but the obstinate resistaunce of that heavenly veryte
which Christ ones taught. He is a very Antichrist which under Christ's tyttle
plays a part clean contrary to Christ. As where as Christ was meke /
gentle / sowlye / merciful / peceable / poor / pytefull / just and true. He
is cruel / ferce / froward / frantyck / tyrannouse / proud / vaynegloriouse
/ spyghtfull / wicked / and false / and yet is all done in Christ's stead what
blasphemye so ever he works. Antichrist after y^ scripturs is he which
calls himself holy / changes y^ laws / observes days and times / does
many false miracles / denies Christ / destroys peoples / wounds unto
death / assoyleth for monye / judges evil good and good evil / is worshypped
of Princes / burns in concupiscence / and shall be destroyed with the only
breath of Gods mouth. Now blow in both your fystes / and tell me whom they
mean. ye know I am sure (...) they are which works all these feats / else
are ye a man of very small experience. But here perauenture ye play Tom
Nytygo. ye know it / but ye will not be acknowne of it.

3 To assertayne you fullye of the matter / the great Antichrist is your
whole clergy with the layte of the same false faith. Of the which your holy
father the Pope with his college of cardinals is the head / All Patriarchs /
Archebishoppes / metropolytanes / bisshoppes / lawers / doctors / prestes /
presones / curates / monks / chanons / and nonnes are the body / and
the.iiii. orders of friars which came last of all are the tail that covers
his arse / which is now cut of in England / and therefore he is there become a
curtall. This is the great body of satan which ministers to the world all
fylthynesse of ydolatrie and necrolatrie. What Peter Frank was by his life
(whom ye call here a lymme of Antichrist) I can not iustlye report / for he was
of an other nacyon. But if that man's life may be called good / whose end is
godly and perfyght / I dare boldelye say that his life was good. For in his
death confessed he the Lord Jesus Christ to be his only sauer and redemer /
which is the true seal mark of the servant of God. In the mids of the fire
also he stood without fear / sorrow / trembling / changynge of countenance
/ or dissolute mouyng: which were plain tokens of a conscience not trobled /
but assertayned throughlye of a much better life after this life. This learned
I in Colchestre of them which were by his only death or pacient sufferau^ce /
converted from your papisme unto true repentance / where as nothing before
could convert them.

4 A very thieves part have ye played here with the text / which ye have taken
out of saint Peter's second epistle. Hi sunt fontes sine aqua / quibus caligo
tenebraru^ reseruatur. For ye have left out of it no less than these.iiii.
words / and nebule turbinibus exagitate. These (says saint Peter) are y^
wells without water / and clouds carried forth with tempests / to whom is
reserved the myste of darkness. This was never spoken for any that ever yet
dyed for the veryte. But for soche subtyle soth sayers as deceive the people /
lyuinge here in all voluptuousness. For thus begins the chapter. Fuerunt
pseudo Prophet in populo / s^cut and in vob is erunt magistri mendaces.
Amongst the people were false prophets / like as there shall be among you
lyenge masters also. These shall preuilye bring in dampnable sects / denienge
the very lord that bought them. Many will follow their voluptuouse ways /
by whom y^ verite shall be blasphemed. For covetousness shall they with feigned
words make merchaundyse of you (says he) but their judgment is not far of
/ neither slepeth their utter dampnacion. All this with much more yet
folowinge of Balaam the false prophet / and of Sodom and Gomor / is spoken of
your filthy spiritualte / if it be indifferentlye marked. And therefore keep it
unto you as yowr own propre good / and turn it not unto those post men
which have no portion therein.

A mysterye.
1 Which said full rank. That Christ and God. Took not manhood. 2 Of Marye
the virgin. Which was without sin 3 Verbum caro factum est. Joan. 1.
The openinge.
ZElouse would this Poet feign be seane in his holy mothers quarrel by y^
vyllenouse contempt of other. But mark the end of it. Whyls he rankelye
accuses other men of heresies / he plays the rank heretyque his self. He
deuydeth me here Christ and God by intermingling a coniunccio^ copulative / as
though they were.ii. and not one. Though Athanastus made a difference of the
godhede from the ma^hede / yet knyt he them together in Christ. But this ra^ke
heretic Papist disseuereth Christ from the godhede / so making owr lady the
mother of.ii. children. He wills also by this proposicion / that Christ
being manne a fore / should take his manhood with God again in Marye. Thus
concludes he.iii. abominable heresies in one. In this had he need to go to
scole again with his great divine / and sumwhat better to be taught to declyne
this matter. Ranker heresies tha^ these / were never taught of Marcion / Manes
/ Arrius / nor Eutices / the greatrest heretyques of all. Therefore Pantolabus
may well stand in the fore ward of heretyques / and be first here of his
own Genealogye. But he is sure to have no harm of the Bysshoppes / for their
smellinge serves the^ not that way. But se how true the promises of the lord
are. He that lays a snare shall fall into it. Who stryketh with the sword /
shall peryshe with the same. And he that judges his poor brother /
condempneth himself. Well / blessed / be the name of that lord.

2 The doctrine of these papystes have a great shine of godliness / yet is it
but filthy hypocresye. The blessed virgin Marye which was the elect mother of
Christ / detesteth soche fryuolouse and blasphemouse bablinges as they give
unto her. As that she was without sin in her concepcion / with soche other
folysh fantasyes. Was not her father a sinner? was not her mother an offender?
Was she not brought forth in Adam? Declined not she with all other? Had she no
need of Christ's sufferinges with other? Though the papists supersticiouslye
deny all this / yet does she sweet virgin afferme it. My soul (says she)
magnifyeth y^ lord / and my spretereioyseth in God my sauer. What neded he to
have been her sauer / if nothing had been in the way to conde^pnacion against
her? Oh / blasphemouse here tyques and excertable papystes / which thus deny
her the benefight of owr redemption. Christ came to save sinners only / and
not the arrogaunt rightouse / which had no need of hi. Like as ye are false
iusti^iaryes / so do ye bestow your stodyes. She never covered as you do with
the proud Pharise / not to be as other men are. But she was well contented
to be of the common sort / to be exalted up from meekness. And as touching
Peter Frank that he should deny Christ to take manhood of her / ye lie
falselye of him. He dyed in no soche wicked opinion as many have crediblye
reported. But sumthynge ye must needs lay for your selves / when ye have done
soche murder and mischefe.

3 Full like a wise clarke bring ye forth that text: Verbum caro factum est /
the word became flesh / and like a fleshlye gentylmanne. I maruele where this
clause was before / that ye joined not God with Christ therewith / but made them
two by the virtue of your coniunccion copulatyue. ye do many mad miracles /
when ye come to your own wits without the scripturs. In ipso vita erat /
says the Gospel before. In that word was the life and the light of men. But
of that word will you fatche no light / nor yet suffer other men to fatche
light there / so far as ye may withstand yt. They must fatche light at you
/ and yet ye are those folyshe virgynes that Christ speaks of / whose lamps
are out / for ye are chaste geldynges all. ye are that folyshe fygge tree which
has nothing else but leaves. When ye are in your most pride / ye shall wyther
away like a thing of naught. It is not this text that confuteth the ungodly
opinion of the Anabaptists. For all they believe that he became flesh. But to
prove that he took that flesh of the virgyne / we must go unto the strong
promyses of God made unto the Serpent / to Abraham / and to David. That Sede of
the woman (says the Lord) shall tread the on the head. In thy Sede (says he
to Abraham) shall all the kyndredes of y^ earth be blessed. Blessed is the
fruit of thy womb / says the holy ghost in Elizabeth to Marie: and so forth.
That illius and that Tui in the textes must be groundelye remembered / and than
shall they not be able ones to hysse at it.

A mysterye.
1 Next after this Came in yvvys. 2 Barnes the blind That never could find. 3
By night nor day The right path way 4 To Christ's lore. 5 Qui peruersi
cordis est, non inuenit bonum. Prouer. 17.
The opening. 1.
BRagyngly still brawleth this babbler and can find non end of his insolent
madness. The mouth of a wytlesse nodye (says Solomon) pours out all
folyshnesse. The heart of a fool (says Ecclesia^ticus) is like a pott that is
broken / for it never retayneth wisdom. Here is now much matter against
Robert Barnes / and all is not worth a nutt. Now comes Pantolabus in with his
rhetoryckes of this and yrcey^ It is very hard aborde with us when we are
driven to soche narrow shyftes / that we must needs have to make up our meters
/ verelye / ywys / and certain with soch like. They that are exercysed in making
/ will judge those meters lowsye. But it is learning good enough for the
graceless Papists / like as draffe is most fyt for swyne. The more folyshe y^
better for the^ / and the more dawyshe it be y^ fytter it is for their gross
wits. No / they will be non of these new heretyques they. The wisdom of
this world has taught them an other lesson than so. They will sleep in an
whole skin though they should to the devil for their errors. Next after this
shall come in sumwhat / but I thyncke no great wisdom into Pantolabus brain /
unless he change from this frantycke frenesye into some purpose godly / and
repent soche wilful wodenesse. But I doubt very much in that.

2 I think in conscience that a blynder beast than Pantolabus / is not this
day alive. If I had nothing else / but these blind poesyes of his to bear me
witness / they were sufficient enough. For soche blind beggerye yet saw I
never / and so garnyshed with the scripturs. O bloderynge Balaamites which
stodye nothing else / but to provoke the people to follow your whoredom. What
Barnes was in the just quarrel of God against your blind beastlye kyngedome
of Antichrist / we are not so blind but we know. And if our testimonye
should fail / the works which he compyled are sufficient witnesses to declare
his godly wytt and learning / of the which we have seane more than.x. under
diverse tyttles. So blind is your popish generation that they never yet were
able to answer one of them. Which of you all with your dyrtye diuynite has
yet soluted but the least of his arguments in his book of prestes matrymoney
or yet of the Masses abusyon? Nay / ye are non of those. It is enough for you
to cry heretyque / heretyque / when ye play no^ other but an heretyques part
yourselues. Never are you good in Christen disputacio^s but when ye have
halters and fire upon your side. Very blind Asses ye apere now a days / for
any good learning ye show / and that is well seane in the treatise of
Standys^e / in Bonners declaracio^s / and in this worshypfull work here of
yours.

3 I pray you hartelye what sweet paths have you found out ever sens the
year of our Lord a M. and one? In the which year was satan your great
grandesyre set at large by your holy father Pope Syluestre y^ second (which
obtained of him by Necromancye / to be saint Peter's vycar) to work in the
world all myschefe by you which are his right fashyoned members. I think the
ways are wonderful / if we should lay the out here together. Neither have you
spared the night nor yet the day to find out all fylthynesse. Ded not you
find out the worshippinge of Images / the praye^ge to rodes / the knelinge to
ladies / the kyssinge of relyques / the sensinge of aultres / and the sekinge
of shrynes / with soche like abhominacyons? It is unspeakable what nombre of
sowles ye have lost by these and soche other path ways of yours besides your
own wretched sowles. This ded ye never yet recant / by protestinge unto your
cures. Good people we have led ye wrong ways by these uncommanded
sacrifices and heythnishe worshippinges. No / I dare boldelye say before God
and manne / that ye never yet repented it for all your often goinge to confession
/ so far are ye from grace and all godliness. The lord of his great mercy
deliver ones his people of that malignau^t generacio^ of yours For never shall
they be but blind / so long as they have you for their gydes.

4 Here ye are not ashamed to accuse good Doctor Barnes that right disciple of
Christ / that he never could find the right way unto Christ's lore. As who
should say the paths that you lead are the very just ways unto Christ's
lore. And this do you write that the people should so believe it. Let us pondre
yowr doings upon your most pri^cipall feasts of the year / as upon cristmas
day / good frydaye / easter day / and penthecost day. And so se whether they
be soche ways as Christ has walked or no. For why / those paths which he
has gone before / are the only ways to his lore. First ye have even song and
compline in latyne with the sensinge of your aultres to begin the solempnite
with / and these path ways Christ never knew. The next day folowinge ye have
mattens / prime / and hours in the same unknown language. ye have holy water
making / procession / and high mass with double sensinge of Images. ye have
at night again euensonge and co^pline with sensinges. With these abominable
ways and soche other was Christ yet never acquainted. But he demands of you
this question by his holy sprete in Esaye / who has required these things at
yowr hands? Co^cludinge with you / that his ways are not your ways nor yet
his paths. Therefore all your pretensed colors are false here.

5 Full true is the clause which ye have here alleged out of Salomons proverbs
/ sauinge only that ye have changed the time to come into the time present.
Qui peruersi cordis est / no^ inuenit bonum / say you. And it is there. Non
inueniet bonum. Who so has an heart given to mischefe / shall in the conclusion
wine no profight therbye. I maruele ye took not with it the clause next
folowinge. Et qui vertit linguam incidet in m^lum. Likewise he that has an
ouerwhart tongue / shall come to a myschefe. This might have been a premonishment
for you / that ye should not thus have raged to your own co^fusyon. Of a
wonderful nature are the scripturs / that they never will serve you unless
they be perverted / mangled / and spoiled of sumwhat. This text here alleged
agrees better with no man than with you. For I think the devil has not a
more perverse stomach than you have as your fruits here declares. I maruele
ye marked not this in the chapter before. He that disdayneth the poor /
blasphemeth him that made him. And he that is glad of an other man's hurt /
shall never be vnponnished. Almost in the end of that chapter / is this text
for Barnes. Preciosi spiritus / vir eruditus. A preciouse sprete has he that
is learned / specially of God. Though your whole generation denies him this /
yet is it known to the Christen world by his godly works to your utter
confusyon and shame.

A mysterye.
1 But evermore By mean of ambycyon Ded so we sedycyon. 2 He said certain In
words plain. 3 It could not be found That we were bound. 4 To be
obedient. 5 Vir apostara iurgia seminat. Sap. 6.
The openinge. 1.
YDyotyshe and folyshe are your poesyes evermore and full of blasphemose lies.
Malyciouslye accuse ye here doctor Barnes of ambicion / which sought nothing
less than ambiciouslye to regne after that manner of your proud modye mustre.
Where as Ambicion is in his most pride / there find ye no fawte with him. But
there ye worship him with cappe / leg / and knee / and would kiss his arse
to please him. To currye fauell he shall be your singular good lord / and a
prelate most wise and pregnau^t / though he have no more godly wytt than an
ape. Thus at a time Ambicion shall be your God / and yet to rebuke an other /
ye can take him for a vice. Oh ungodly flatterer and false glosynge hypocrite.
Learn first to se that vice / where it is most depelye regnyng / and correct
it in yours self when ye play soche an hypocrites part. For all your
crepynge and crowchyng to soche ydolouse shepeherdes / is for that sweet
Ambicion whom your heart so sore coueteth. And as concerning sedicions and
scysmes. Not one has been in Christendom notable these D.CCC. years / but
your false generation has been therein the chief doers / as all the Chronicles
mencioneth. What myschefe ye ded ones in the cite of London in king Rychardes
time the second abought an horse lofe / it is shame yet to rehearse / besides
that ye have wrought there and in other quarters of England ever sens that
time.

2 He that does speak the thing that is true and certain / and without false
colors of cauteles does utter it in words plain / is much better occupied
than ever were you yet. For that which you have taught in the church and yet
do still teach daily / so but the very doctrine of deuyls / so uncertain
and untrue as they are. Nothing else are your histories of the Saints but
fables / lies / and fantasyes taken out of Legenda aurea made by fryre James de
voragine. The promyses that ye make to the people concerning your Masses /
that some of them should be wholesome for the pox / sum for the pestylence /
sum for the ague / sum for the headake / sum for y^ f^wle evil and soche
other / are false and abhominably practysed of you to deceive the simple for
money. And like wise your frydaye fastings / ladies psalters / and rosaryes
/ with bedes / primers / py^turs / candels / holy wax and other wytcherye
more. Never are the sweet promyses of the Gospel made plain unto the people
by you / but darkened evermore with your hypocrites gloses. Neither will ye
enter into the kyngedome of God youreselues / nor yet suffer any other that
would gladlye enter. All your stodye is to uphold those mytred Mahometes the
Bisshoppes to maynteyne you still in the kyngedome of fleshlye ydelnesse. And
for that ye care not how many Christen sowles ye murder.

3 As conning as ye make ye in finding / ye show your self here but a
false and a deceytfull sercher. ye say first to Barnes charge that he sowed
sedicion. This is no new thing in you / but an old used practyse in your
craftye generation. Of sedicion was Christ accused by the high Prestes / yet
caused they Barrabas that was the sedicion worker and a murderer also / by
their instaunt labor to be saved. Paul was complained of to the debyte Felix
to be a commocion maker / not without the false counsel of the Bisshoppe
Ananias / yet was he a man most peceable and godly. Happy is Robert Barnes
therefore with them so to be noted of. the same self sort. Plain are his
words good manne / in all the works he has made / concerning obedience dew
both to God and to his prince. In all his wrytynges can not I find one clause
of disobedience to either of them. Manifestlye declared he his obedience
toward God / in that he for his truths sake forsook all worldly estimacion
that he might ^ele have had / and at the latter end gave his life for it also.
And as touching the kings mageste / his large supplycacion unto him directed
/ is a sufficient wtynesse thereof toward him / besides y^ book which he wrote
unto him in Latin concerning the lives of the Romish Popes. But it will here
after apete some other obedience that Pantolabus complayneth of / than either
of these be.

4 I perseyue by the circumstaunce of this matter / that the holy obedience
which Pantolabus means here / that could not be found out of Barnes /
smells toward Rome. For it is a spiritual obedience belonging only to
his mother holy church / which is no congregation of the lewd layte / but of
spiritual prelates / as his holy father the Pope with all his college of
card makers / arche byteshepes / and byteshepes / dockers / presters / and
currates. These are the high powers that he speaks of here after / to whom
he would have us so sore bound to be obedient in pain of deadlye sin /
because that his honorable mastershyp might be looked upon also as a right
worshypfull curat^ among them / concerning his tithes and offerynges. For it
is an ill world when the people will not know their duty to h^lye church.
A great decay is it to their holy mother that the cursynge sentence is gone.
This was the obedience that doctor Barnes could never find in all the
scripturs / and therefore means were sought out to have him brent for an
heretyque without examinacion of his articles. Where as if he had acknowledged
this / he had been still a live. Thus play these Romish gentylmenne / colle
under the candelstick / cloynige under craftye colors to clought up their
false kingedom of deuyllishnesse again if it may be The subtilte of the
serpent is not yet all dead / but lies still lurkinge in their generation / to
work all myschefes.

5 Scripturs have we non of this wretched Papyst / but either they are wrasted
/ hacked / ma^gled / or else falselye alleged. Vir Apostata iurgia seminat / is
here now brought in / which wants no lessethan.xvii. words of the whole
sentence to serve his false purpose. And to amend the matter he notes it
the.vi. Chapter of Sapience / where is it is not so / but the.vi. Chapter of
Salomons Proverbs. His concordaunce there deceived him. For that only he
sought for this text and not the Bible. And thus ly^th the text there. Homo
apostata vir inuitlis graditur ore peruerso / annuit oculis / terit pede /
digito loquitur / prauo cord machina turmalum / et omni tempore iurgia
seminat. A dissembling person / a man myndinge no goodness / has all
these propyrte^^ with him. He carries a deceitful mouth / his eyes winketh
wyles / his fete traceth toys / he points with his fingars / he is always
Imageninge evil / and in every place co^monlye he sows discord. To this
end does not Pantalabus bring in this text here / but only to prove Barnes
an apostata for leauinge his fryres cote with y^ Popes obedience. And in this
has he showed himself here in his own right colors / a through Papyst in
deed (I will not say a ra^ke traitor) to approve my conjecture before. Easy
is it to se what lies in the hearts of these pestilent poyseners of the people
/ wha^ the forsakinge of a pylde frytes cote is so wayghtye a matter with them
yet still. The sequel of that Chapter ded not Pantolabus mark / for his own
amendment and others. For he found it not in his co^cordaunce. Sex sunt que
odit Dominus / et septimum detestatue anima eius. Sex things are there which
the lord hates / and the seventh he abhors without remedy. A proud look
a dissemblinge tongue / hands shedinge innocent blood / an heart Imageninge
evil / fete that are swyft to do myschefe / a false lyenge witness / and he
that sows discord among brethren. In this clear myrrour he might have
seane himself in the hate of God / and a great sort more of his cumpany.

A mysterye.

sin But what ded he vvynne. 3 He was tied at a post. And there ded roste.
4 Onnis anima potestatibus subdita sit. Romans 8.
The openinge.1.
MAlice has so blinded this imprude^t pratler / that he seyth not the way he
goes in. And though he does se it plain enough yet doubts he not the
dangers thereof. And parauenture he needs nor neither. For the wynker of wyles
and y^ seker out of subtyltees has put him and his company in assurance /
that though they slide a little in the dark / yet shall they catch no scathe.
For naught is it not that they daunse attendaunce / plainge placebo with
Reynarde the fox. At all times shall they be redye to give warninge / if any
parell be toward their whelps. Let them do nothing else in the mean season
/ but se always that the people obey the commandment of the high powers /
meaning by the^ the spiritual prelates. And that they believe as holy church
does teach the^ after the old customs of their au^cie^t elders / for these
new falshyoned ways are nothing worth. If any be busye with these new
books against those high powers / let them cause their sworn satellites to
indite them of heresye. Come they ones that ways vndretheir spiritual hands
/ they shall find less ease of it than either thief or murderer. Therefore it
shall be mete at all hours and seasons for him that will live in rest / to be
obedient to these high powers / though he should for their obedience utterly
forsake God and obey the devil. For their obedience is non other.

2 A far diverse obedience is this from al other. For it bideth unto sin /
as witnesses also the great wise clarke Johan Standishe in his treatise of
reporche agei^st Barnes. And I believe it well / for their laws /
commandments / and customs / to who^ they would bind us / are nothing else
but filthy Idolatrye and sin. Agreinge with y^ sainge of Saint Paul. That
is not of the faith which Christ has taught / is wickedness and sin. I
wot that of a craft they will say here they mean the ki^ge / though they
mind nothing less / but under that color to establishe again the decayed
a^ctorite of their whorishe church. Why should Pantolabus else call Barnes here
craftelye / an Apostata. That clause was not all brought in for naught. The
manne meant sumwhat more tha^ he durst well utter. But where as he does
scornefullye axe this question / what Barnes ded win by so disobeinge the
holy fathers? I will answer it for him / because he is now dead. He has
won so much as Christ promised him / which set him a work. That is /
persecucion / enprisonment and death. And truly that was a sweet winninge /
for therewith has he won also the life everlasting. Who so ever will save
his life (says Christ) shall lose it. And he that shall lose his life for my
sake / shall find it again in the life everlasting. Saint Paul said
boldelye unto the Philippyanes that death was unto him a winninge. And I know
that the lyberall hand of the lord is not yet abreuiated.

3 Now steppeth forth Pantolabus as brag a body lowse / and as one depelye
learned in y^ scole of scornefulnesse / he soluteth his own wise question. He
declares to the world what Barnes d^d^ win for not obeienge holy church /
as though men were ignorant thereof. He tells them with so much spite as
he can well Imagine / that Barnes was tied to a post in Smytfelde at London
with.ii. companions more / and that he there ded roste. But he says nothing
(I trow) of the Popes.iii. sworn chaplaynes Powell / Abell / and fetherston
his own sweet companions which were the some day and hour in the same self
smithfelde both hanged and quartered for treason. No / that disobedience
touches not Pantolabus. I told you before that he would at the last declare
unto you for all his craftye colors what obedience he meant. O holy Rome holy
Rome / thu spiritual Sodom and Egypt / much beholden art thu to thy secret
lovers in England so workema^ly to cloyne in thy cause. As concerning good
Robert Barnes whose end is thought without honor of y^ daintye babes of this
world. He is counted among the dear children of God / and has his portion
with the saints. Though he seems lost to y^ ungodly wise / yet rests he
swetelye in the peace of the lord. As gold in the hot fyerye furnace tries
he his electes / and as a brent offeringe receives the^ For soche matters
passes not after ye blind judgment of men lyuinge here in wa^tonnesse.

4 Always is Pantolabus like him wc tempted Christ in the desert / whose
Apostleship he has here deuoutlye taken upon him. Still uses he his old
roberyes and legerdemaynes with the scripture. Here gives he us a mangled
text of Saint Paul to the Romans / appointing us the.viii. chapter instede
of the. xiii. If it be not honest play and clean conueyaunce / I report me to
you. Omnis anima potestatibus subdit^sit says he in both his coppyes but
sublimioribus is out there / for seruinge his spiritual purpose. Let every
soul (says he) submit it self to the powrs / but the hyghar powers he names
not / least he should have mentioned the king / myndinge nothingelesse. For he
is the higher power / and God is y^ highest of all. Powers without higher or
highest are always indifferent / and may be iudgled with / and therefore he
puts them here for the Prelates of his church. But Saint Johan says in the
Apocalypse / that their powers are of the Serpent / which gave his auctorite and
seat to that beastlye Antichrist of theirs. When Christ spoke of worldly
powers / he ernestlye charged his Apostles to obey them / but in no case to
take them upon them. I wondre of the blyndenesse of Pantolabus / that he
perseyueth not what follows in the same Chapter. Nemini debeatis quicquam /
nisi vt inuicem diliga^is. Let nothing be done among you but in mutual
love / says Saint Paul. Let charity be the power that you shall occupye /
for that fulfylleth the law. If this power reigned in Prelates / and were so
well taught of them as it is commanded / neither should the high powers have so
much a do in ponnyshinge theft / whoredom / and murder / nor yet so many of
their spiritual swarm be whoremongers / murderers / and robbers of the
common people as they are.

A mysterye.

enim cachena tenebrarum colligati erant. Eccle. 17.
The openinge. 1.
Exceeding hot and modye is this ma^ne still in his matters / and will not
have done with Barnes yet for a little. He now describes his standinge in the
fire betwixt Garade and Hierom. But he tells not which of his own generation
hinge that day in the mids / of powell / Abell and fethersto^. No / that
pleased him not so well as this. For these were fryndes to his holy father of
Rome / where as they were enemies. His eye sight therefore served him not so well
upon this side as upon that side. The Popes enemies are the only heretics in
his Genealogye here / and not the enemies of Christ and his king. Be that
far from him to judge those good virtuous fathers of holy church any
heretyques. No / I warande you / Cardinal Pole / fryre Peto / fryre Buckenham
/ and other rank papists abroad / are yet non heretyques with him / but
relygiouse vpholders of that holy mother of his the church of Rome. Truth it
is that Thomas Garade a bachelar of divinity and person of honye lane / was
tied to that post upon his right side / for preachinge against Antichrist. And
that ded Christ before time promise hi^ in Peter for a reward / if he would be
a preacher in his kyngedome. When thu were young (says he) thu gyrdedst
thyselfe / and walkedst at thy pleasure. But when thu art old / thu shall
streche forth thy hands / and an other shall gyrde the / leadynge the
contrary to thy mind. And therefore this was unto him a promised reward of
his master / which had no better of the world his self.

2 If Garade were a brother of Barnes / of a lykelyhode he was non than of
Pantolabus brotherhede / as were Abell and Powell. For if he were / he would
nor regestre him for an heretyque. But I putt the case that Garade and Barnes
both be now of that bretherhede which God the father has allowed for his son
Jesus sake / as it is most like to be so. For that heretage in Christ is not
promised unto them which live here in wanton pleasurs and are murderers in
contempt of the Christen veryte / but unto those despised disciples that are
persecuted and scorned / and that suffer death for the same. What shall become
than of Pantolabus and soche other disciples of Antichrist / which has with so
villenouse spyght refused that bretherhede / yt is easy to conjecture / if
they de^olye repent not in time. Happy is Thomas Garade that ever he was
borne. Not only in that he taught Christ here for an only sauer without the
mangye merytes of men / but also in that he has with his own dear life /
sealed as a sure witness unto the same against Antichrist. This singular
profyght has he all redye gotten thereby That he shall from henceforth neither
honger nor thirst / and that God has wyped away all tears from his eyes.
Never more shall he taste of death / of losses / nor yet of sorrows / for the
first sorrows are past. Now is he sure to be allowed for a fre cytezen in the
new Jerusalem / when his lord shall sytt in the regeneracion.

3 Pantolabus yet still to conferme his doctrine with blasphemies and lies /
allegeth here the.xvii. chapter of Ecclesiastes / otherwise called the preacher
/ and the whole book has no more but.xii. chapters in all. I warande you the
manne means sumwhat by it. In deed this clause: Vna enim cathena tenebrarum
colligati erant / is in y^ xvii. chapter of Sapience. But I maruele sore where
omnes is become. He was surely laid aside for some cloynynge purpose. That
chapter is all together of the sore judgments of God / concerning the
Egypcyanes. They were all bound (says the wise manne) with one cheane of
darkness. And this was for that they thought still to have in subieccion his
holy people. Saint Johan says in the Apocalypse that your spiritual cy^e or
holy mother church is now that Egypt and Sodom. I pray God ye do not
condemn him for an heretyque. He says there also that ye should in your
firetes throw forth the bodies of the lords witnesses / but ye should not
suffer them to be laid in graves. Me thinks he is there very plain with
you / and towcheth you sumwhat nyghlye. The wise manne in the same chapter of
yours appointed out your generation / and gave ye a lawful warning /
saying there before. Propter hoc indisciplinate anime errauerunt / etc. for
this cause only do men err / that they will not be reformed (lord) by thy
wisdom. For that shall they be wrapped in the cheances of long darkness.
Their sorceryes and incha^ntme^tis shall come to derisyon / and their proud
wysdom shall be brought to shame.

1 And on the left hand One Hierome ded stand. 2 One of that nest As blind
as the best. 3 And thus they three Now burned be. 4 Ipsi sibi grauiores
tenebrae. Eccless. 17.
The openinge. 1.
I Ngenyouse would Pantolabus apere in this descripcion / leaving out no
circumstau^ce of doctor Barnes burning. Now brings he forth Hierome the
person of Stepnaye / declarynge him to stand upon his left hand / as though
it had not been known before. But fetherstone he forgetreth which was a right
brother of hi^ / and was hanged there for treason the same self day. ye hear
him not tell here on which side he honge. As for the kings matters he passes
not gr^atlye upon them / but holy churches matters are an other manner of
thing. He will not describe a trayterouse Papist / least he should so s^^t
forth his own propre image. Wyllyam Hieriome in deed / a bachelar of diuynite
also / and a man eloquentlye learned / for the veryte preaching against
Antichrist / stood on the leftehande of Barnes in the fire and was brent with
him to ashes. And blessed is he that ever he had a life so to bestow against
that abominable kingdom of yours. That fire was unto him but a delyueraunce
from miseries / restorynge his soul to that quiet which he has now in Christ
Jesus. Not the more vnpure was that offered up treasure which the lord left with
him in an carth^n vessel / though the vessel were scorfled in the heat of
that flame / but the much more orie^t and precyouse. For matters stand no^ a
fore god as you do judge them / but as he has determined them by his holy
word and promise.

2 To enlarge his poesyes with some blind thetoryckes / he shows that
Wyllyam Hierome was one of that nest. But what that nest is / he declares not
/ but leaves it all blind / as he is always a blind leader. A nest in the
scripturs has both a good origynall and a godly significacion / though
Pantolabus here mocketh with it for want of good lerninge. By the wisdom and
apointment of God was it first fashioned / and sumtyme it betokens the true
church / sumtyme the conscience of man. The false counterfeit church which
Pantolabus here mainteyneth / is no wholesome nest in deed / but y^ insaciable
chaos or bottomless pyt that S. Johan speaks of / which has darkened the
sun that is Gods word / and sends forth nothing else but a fylthie smoke
of tradicions and of men's lowsye lerninge with an innumerable swarm of their
lecherouse locustes. As are mytred Byshopes / Gorgio^se Prelates / Prestes
smered with grese / shaven sorcerers / and chaplaynes disgised like disardes in
a mommerye in many strange kinds and colors. Who can with less honest
call a man blind / than he that is blind all together? Of all that Pantolabus
has here taught in this Genealogye / is not one scripture truly applied nor
yet after any honest sort declared. But as a blind sorgeon or dog leche /
he has turned it all into one blind eyesalue to blind men all together.
True is it in him that Saint Johan ded say. Though the light does shine in the
darkness / yet will not the darkness receive it. Much water comes by the
myl (...) (they say) that the myller takes not in.

3 Now concludes Pantolabus his lon^^ lowsye circumstaunce conceruinge Doctor
Barnes and his company / shewinge us hete that all they three are burned. And
not a little glad is he and his generation thereof / for so much as they three
ded them so deadlye noyaunce by their preachinges. It cost them no small stodye
to bring it to pass / nor yet small diligence and labor to have it so to
their mind. But yet had they with it a soul displeasure / for so much as there
were the same self day and hour.iii. mighty captains of their holy
assemblye / hanged and quartered for treason / before the same self people.
Like as the deaths of these. ii. companyes were diverse / so were their
opinions and causes. The one sort dyed for Christ / the other for the Pope. For
uphold ^ge of Antichrist was powell / Abell / and fetherston hanged. For
helpinge down his kingedom was Barnes / Garade / and Hierome burned. Fortunate
are they which suffered for Christ / for their reward is said forth in the
scripturs and promises of the lord. For the other is there neither scripture
nor promise. Though they were most greuouslye tormented before men / yet was
their hope full of immortalyte which now they feel ineffect. Their sowles are
now in the hands of God / and sure to suffer no more torments. Though they
seemed before the unwise to dye / yet are they n^w in a life much better. As
sun beams shall they shine in y^ day appointed / and judge y^ nations which
are now unfaithful.

4 Well may that spyghtfull spiritual t^ be called the kyngedom of Antichrist
or beasi^ye body of Satan / as the Apocasyps does name it / for their
beastlye workinge. I think the devil of hell could not more irreverently and
mockingly handle the sacred scripturs / than this wreched fellawe does. For
here he brings in a text. Ipsi sibi grauiores tenebre / which he has both
spoiled of words / astered in sentence / and distroyed for the true
understanding / puttinge / the nominative case for the ablative. And because
he would be behind with us in no point of falshede / he has sent us to seek
it in the.xvii. Chapter of Ecclesiastes / and there is no Chapter so called in
the whole Bible. In deed in the.xvii. Chapter of Sapience I find this clause.
Ipsi ergo sibi erant grauiores tenebris. yea / they were worse unto them selves
(says Sapience) than any other darkness possible. This was at that time
spoken for the Egipcianes / and now it extends to you Papystes folowinge them
in the same self steps of Idolatrye. The cause why ye do so da^pnablye err
/ is that ye will not be reformed by the wysdo^ of God as the beginning of
that Chapter specify^th / but ye take your own ways in all things.
Frequenter enim (says he) preoccupa^t pessini^ / redarguente consciencia. Often
times do they those wicked things / that their conscience rebukes them of
When ye have practiced deceyt / spoken lies / exercysed fylthynesse / done the
innocent to death / with soche other feats / your minds are not always in
quiet. In token whereof ye go often to confession / yet are your lives seldon the
better.

1 I fear me sore There will come more. 2 Unto that end Except they amend.
3 Vix corriguntur impij. Eccle. 1.
The openinge. 1.
OVt of no small charity aryseth this fear of Pantolabus / least any more
should come to the end of Barnes / or be brent in the fire as he was. yea / so
brotherlye he tendereth that matter / and with so much Christen love / that he
would not greatly care to be the first that should accuse a true Christen
beleuer if he knew his faith throughlye. As much py^^ has he in those
matters / as has either the fox upon the chyckens or the wolf upon the
lamb. I would that Pantolabus should take care for his old shows if he has
them / and not for Christ's dear members. For they must enter heaven by the
straight got as he ded / and not by the broad way which leads (...) to
destruccio^. They must suffer hatred / wrong / spyght / vengeance / ill
reports / persecucions / exyle / curses / lies / blasphemies / enprisonme^tes
/ ^hyrst / hongre / and death of their bodies / for ryghtousnesse sake / el^
shall they not be like members to their head For his spouse is a church that
suffers / and not the pr^^de gentle woman that, mustreth with myters /
canapees / copes / crysmatoryes / crosses / cruettes / and candelstyckes. A
comp^nye of brethren there are underneath the altar (as Saint Ioha^ reports
which daily calls to y^ lord to have their blood revenged of that gorgiouse
apareled gentyl woman (which is dronken with the excess thereof and their
nombre must be fulfilled with soche poor sowles. And till that be fynished /
there must daily follow more / n^ remedy.

2 Much doubt has Pantolabus for this end. But he had more need to take care
for himself / least an halter be bewixt him and his end. For he has so
plentuouslye deserved it as has any other rank Papist of that affinite / if
this Jest of his be but indifferentlye wayed. As for those good men (whom he
hee^ most cruellye blasphemeth without lerninge) though their deaths were not
very preciouse in his folyshe judgment / because he is led of a contrary
sprete / yet were they right pleasant to their lord God / in whose kyngedom
now they rest with Abraham / Isaac / and Jacob. If they had dyed for fellonye
/ murder / whoredom / or treason / I would with Pantolabus have judged their
deaths very ill. Se that non of you suffer (says Saint Peter as an homicide
/ thief / or ill doe^. If any manne suffer as a cristiane / let him not be
ashamed thereof / but glofy^^e God in that behalf. For wtstandinge the false
kingedom of Antichrist in the beiytees quarrel dyed they / as it is evident to
all right judgments / and therefore their deaths are gloriouse. The amendment
which Pantolabus requires here / concerns the obedience of that malygnaunt
mustre of those mitred mahou^des / who^ he would in no wise to decay. But let
him set his heart at rest / for the lord is almost at a point with that
wretched wytcherye.

3 Vnplesau^t evermore are the scripturs to Pantolabus / and that apereth well
by his monstruouse handelynge of them. Here brings he in to co^ferme his
purpose / a ragged patche out of the first chapter of Ecclesiastes otherwise
called the preacher / but not as it is there spoken. For here it is / Vix
corriguntur impi^. And there it is thus / peruers^ diffici^e corriguntur. A
very hard thing is it (says he) to make the crooked straight / or the
froward well disposed. Parauenture he has made this alteracion here to show
himself copiouse in the latyne speech. For most commonly the papists are
full of ^ayne glory. But it is always ill speed / when pride goes before and
shame comes after. But I think verelye this text following was in his way
when he made that change Ecce magnus effectus sum / and precess^omnes sapientia
etc. Look upon me well / for I am a great wise prelate. I have got more
wisdom than they which went before me. For soles many times have soche
ymaginacio^s of theemselues. More mete were it both for Pantolabus and soche
other to consydre by that chapter of Solomon / that all which is under the
sun / is but vanyte / the word of the lord excepted. And in so doing / he
should well perseyue that all which he and his generation here maynteyneth / is
but fylthynesse / dyrt / and poison / nothing furderynge the soul of man /
but destroyenge yt rather.

in preson also after the death of James / were glad to absent themselves for a
time / and in diverse howses to play the corner crepers. This therefore is non
of your seven deadlye sins.

3 Nothing agrees this that follows here / with that which went before. For
he that is a sleper bears no fair face a broad so long as he is a sleper.
Neither is he seane in every place / which is a corner crepet. Wherefore these
rhetorycall poesyes of Pantolabus seems very folyshe and wytlesse. He should
apere a much better Poet / would he ones leave the company of dame
ignorance. Truly she is many times to nygh his elbowe when he sets his
pen to the book. Like as she is also with Doctor yncke pott otherwise called
Johan Standyshe. A fair face has your holy mother y^ church of Antichrist
borne outwardlye in every place / with copes / crosses / ceremonies / and
sensynges. yet does the scripturs call her a very whore and the Synagoge of
satan. And that fair face of hers was first represented as a preuyall sign /
in him which was the first head of the Rome church by the permissyon of Phocas
the false emprour For his name at that time was Bonifacius / which is as much
to say as bona facies / a good face or a glosynge pretense of counterfett
holiness. The dowter of a mourthere^ is that holy mother of yours / therefore
must she be given to murder of very nature. For Phocas trayterouslye slew
his master Mauricius which was the Emprour before him / and so entered into his
rowme. In token that she should destroy the Empire / and maintain her estate
by murder.

4 I think verelye that Pantolabus will never be at other point / but still
pervert the scripturs / and send us to Hierico to seek them. Soche a mocking
wretch hard I never of / days of my life yet / neither among Christianes
nor Paganes / infydels nor deuyls. Here he takes a spoiled text / Multos enim
supplantauit nequitia illorum. And he appoynteth us to seek yt in the.xix.
chapter of Sapience / where as yt is but the iii. chapter of Ecclesiasticus or
of Jesus Syrach. And there yt stands thus. Multos enim s^pplanta^it suspicio

which are to curyouse in the search of Gods hydden secrets. The medlynge with
soche mysteryes (says he) has begyled many a man / and tangled their
wits in vanyte. If his sight had served him well / he might have found after
in that chapter for a farther understanding of that text / this clause also.
Synagoge superborum non erit sanitas / etc. To the Synagoge of the proud
pampred up porkelynges shall be left no health. For the sin that is planted
in them / shall be roted out / and yet shall yt not be perceived of them. But
the heart of him which has understanding / shall perceive things very high.
The dilygent ^are will harken to wisdom / and the heart that is wise shall have
persyght intellygence. The godly prudent will absteyne from vices / and
increase in the works of ryghtuousnesse.

1 yet are they as frovvarde And as unto ward. 2 As the other were Of whom
ye ded here. 3 For without doubt It will not out. 4 That is bred by the bone.
The opening. 1.
Always is Pantolabus one manne / still yet blasphemynge these poor innocent
sowles. True is that Lord of his word and promise / which told them before
hand that they should always have the world an aduersarye. And that they
should look for non other fruits of gentylnesse thereof / but scornful rebukes
and slanders. In co^fyrmacion of this / Saint Johan says also in his
reuelacion / that as the true preachers has at any time fynyshed their
faithful testimonye or massage / the beast that came out of the bottomless
pyt (which is the great body of Satan or swarm of Antichrists brood) should
evermore make war against them / and still overcome them as co^cerninge the
body / their faith remayninge always invincible. Here does Pantolabus (which
is a maliciouse membre of the same mad mustre) report the true servants of y^
lord to be very froward in opinion and full untoward in faith to his
mind. They be leave not the new articles which his holy church has taught
of Saints / Images / relliques / rags / rotten rodes / confessio^s / Masses
/ suffrages / diriges / purgatory / processions / pylgrimages / and pardons
with soche other b^astlye beggeryes for their advantage. But evermore blessed
be the eternal name of that lord for so visytinge his poor people with
knowledge from above / which has taught them to abhor that fylthinesse /
wherein is nothing else but dampnacion.

2 As a natural membre of the before named body of Satan / does Pantolabus
show himself here. For like as the said Satan accused Job before the lord /
and has been ever sens an accuser of owr brethren in his members / so does
Pantalabus now accuse them also / as one naturallye given unto the same feate.
They are as froward (says he) against holy church / and as untoward to do
any thing to her commodite / as the other sort / that is to say / frith /
Lambert Barnes / and soche other were before / of whom ye have hard here in
this worshypfull Genealogye. Of them in deed we have hard sufficientlye that
they could in no wise away with the whoredom of your holy mother in her
Idolatrouse ceremonies and sacrifices. If these be now in the same self
taking also / we have cause much to rejoice / and to give high thanks unto
God so to deliver their consciences from your Babilonishe burdenes. It is a
full manifest token that his persecuted church is not yet all dead / but that
he still lives in his trobled members according to his just promise and shall
do to the end of the world. For the church that is his dear spouse / is not
gloriouslye painted out to the world with gold / silver / preciouse stone /
and pearl. But inwardlye decked with faith / hope / charity / and the
rightousnesse of Christ. And outwardlye she is adourned with calamitees /
ve^acions / most slaunderouse rebukes / and death.

3 Glad are we to hear it / that the ernest sprete of Christ is not yet
extinguished in them for all yowr most cruel assaults of penaltees /
inprisonmentes / famisheme^tes / halters / swerdes / faggottes / fryre / and
all other torments else. A remnau^t is there yet lest of them which has not
bowed their knees to yowr false God Baal. To them has the lord promised a
crown of life / if they persevere stedefast to the end. For these do we pray
daily with tears with are a broad in exyl^ / that they do not swetue from that
stedefast rock at the venemouse suggestions of your filthy generation / as
some fleshly wantons has done now of late to their sowles detriment. Better
had it been for them that they never had given that is holy to dogs and
swyne after Christ's premonishementes / than thus shamefullye to become swyne
with them and so to tread his preciouse pearls under their fete. For in so
denienge the lords verite before men / they have showed themselves what they
are / eue^ the flesshlye lovers of themselves / and unworthy of Christ. More
harm have they done than they which hyd the lords treasure / never openinge
their mouths to declare it. Those are they which are neither hot nor cold /
whom the lord has promised to spewe out of his mouth / or utterly to reject
them from the eternal her^tage of his / clerlye racinge their names out of the
book of life / if they repent it not sore.

4 If those good creaturs (whom Pa^tolabus here spyghtfullye reports)
cleaneth fast unto their bone / we are greatly joyful thereof. For a more
manifest token ca^ not be that they are Christ's members than that. By that
inseparable says apere they to be his natural spouse in deed / a bone of his
bones and a rybbe of his rybbes. Now are they by that means become his own
dear members / his mystical flesh and body. He that shall now persecute them
/ shall persecute the apple of his eye / so dear and preciouse are they unto
him. For their faithful perseuerau^ce make we daily intercessions with tears
from our hearts / which are now dispersed or scattred abroad in the regions of
Samaria and Judea / for the persecucio^ that is at Jerusalem. With the wiges
that the lord has graciouslye given us which are his words and examples ded
we fly into the wilderness / so sone as we perseyued that the rode Dragon
vometed waters to destroy the says which we gat^ by his word* ye shall be
persecuted (says Christ) from cite to cite. For if they have persecuted me /
they shall also persecute you. But as they shall pursue you in one cite / flee
you always into an other. Not only was this Christ's counsel but he ded it
also in effect. He fled into Egypt in his yowthe / he declyned from the
malice of his enemies / and he absented himself from the Jews. In that
wilderness has he prepared for us as he ded for Helias to feed us there for
the space of a thousand ii. hundred and three score days.

NArrowlye does Pant^labus look to his matters now / least all would away from
his holy mother / to the great detryment of his popish lyuinge. Though frith
/ Lambert / Barnes / and soche other be gone / yet are there (he says) of the
same sort still remayninge / as ill to his generacio^ as they Whose blood he
would have his holy mother to drink / so bloodthurstye is the spiritual heart
of the manne and zelouse in her quarrel. He is very glad that his good
graciouse lord of wynchestre does stir so well about him as he does. He
turmoyleth in their kind these new Gospel readers / to cause all English
men to abhor Christ's testament / but unto the Stews of London he is a
full gentle benefactor and founder. Not only does he leave them unrebuked of
very tender sauer and love / but also full fatherlye he mainteyneth them with
y^ lordelye wages of his servants / and sumtyme with the delycates of his
own table by the lyberalite of them. I think this fatherlye beniu^lence of
his / is for some respect that he has to the common welthe / or else to
qualyfye the great heates of his hot howsholde / which every where tosseth
like termagauntes with the blood of our lord / the soul / the heart / the
flesh / the body / the bones. This is the holy Gospel that he maynteyneth.
Blind are they called here of Pantolabus / which will not follow these
virtuous rewles to the vpholdynge of their markett in confessyons at lent. But
the eternal father deliver his flock from the abominable blyndenesse of them.

2 Non can ryghtlye se after the blind opinion of Pantolabus / unless they be
led blyndefelde in the dark / by the sprete of his holy mother. She must
set upon their noses y^ spotted specularyes of her old tradicions and
customs / or else is yt nothing worth. If they should be now without their
Latin hours (wherewith never manne yet was Christenlye edifyed) their Christen
relygyon were clerelye lost. If they should not have their accustomed wainlynges
in the temple / their processionynges / their sensynges / their holy water
swyngynges with soche other joys of old Troy / they would think that heaven
were out of the world and hell comen home to their doors. This is the sight
that Pantolabus requires / non other would he the people to have / least they
should in a while be much godlyar wise than he. This houglye sight despised
Johan Wyclef and Johan Husse. This filthy sight contempned Mariyne Luther and
Melanchton. It was nothing for the appetyte of Oecolampadius and zwinglius /
with soche other more. And that is the very cause why they are regestred here
of Pantolabus for heretyques. These are they that were blind before / because
they had not that sight of his holy mother. And they which comes after keeps
now yet still in store the same self blyndenesse in his folyshe opinion / and
therefore he is not contented with them / but would very feign have them burned
for heretyques if yt might be.

3 Before grefe is yt to the stomach of Pantolabus / that any should be alive
which favors not the Pope. This parauenture will be rekened a slaundre / but
the denyll of lie yt is. What other is yt but to prefer a man / when we
magnifye his works? Are any other things called upon here than matters of
Papistrye? No verelye. Not one point is sought here of Christ's clear
institucion. Neither his holy Supper nor Baptym / compassion of y^ poor nor
mutual charity / nor yet the true preaching of repentance by the Gospel of
salvation. But here seeks Pantolabus with all power possible to hold up
Antichrists kyngedome for falling / and that with the most spyghtfull ^omempt
of his Christen brethren which is but a filthy building. For more enclynynge
to Christ's clear veryte than to their vnwolsom Papistye / he accuses them
here most malyciouslye of preuye vpstorynge and close enclosynge together of
cankred heresye. As though the Gospel of y^ lord (which they have received as
his only power to save them) were most cankred and pestylent heresye. Thus do
they to cause the people to abhore yt / and to bring the world in an ill
opinion of them that owes yt fauer. Non other is the nature of soche execrable
lo^ustes / which are crept out of the smoke of the bottomless pytt / but
always to stynge / hurt / sle^ / and destroy all that is grene upon the
earth. All that has received any quyekenesse of believe by the word of the
living Lord / would they wyther up to the fire of hell.

4 True is the clause of Ecclesiastes that Pantolabus here allegeth for a full
confirmacion of his matter / if yt were truly bestowed. Stultorum infinitus
est numerus. Of foles is there an infynite noumbre or an innumerable sort. This
was not spoken for the small flock of Christ's persecuted members / whom the
world reputeth for foles / for they are but few in nombre. Many are called
(says he) but very few are chosen. But this was first uttered for that
pleasau^tlye disposed multitude of this world / who^ God has reputed / and
still does yet repute foles in his scripturs, The noumbre of those foles are
infynite in deed / and their swarm innumerable. Of his faithful servants
does the Lord know the noumbre / for he has their names written in the book
of life. But of these ruffelynge rutters he knows no noumbre / for his
knowledge most co^monlye is his acceptacion / which they shall never enjoy.
Wisdom had yt been for Pantolabus to have considered this text there also.
Vidi cunc^a que fiunt sub sole. Et ecce vniuersa vanitas and afflictio
spiritus. I beheld all things (says the wise manne) done under the sun.
And I perceived well they were all but vanyte and vexacion of mind. By this
might he have considered / what his folyshe Papistrye is / not rysynge of the
express word and commaundment of God / but of the syckle fantasyes of men.
That yt is but mere vanyte and madness / and that the obseruacion thereof is
execrable fylthynesse.

A mysterye.
1 But I pray God To spare the rod. 2 And that with heart They may convert. 3
And call for grace While they have space. 4 Dum lucem habetis, credit in
lucem, vt filij lucis sitis. Joan. 12.
The openinge. 1.
By all p^uyshe pathwayes of Papistrye has Pantolabus wandered here / and at
the last he playstreth up his pedlarye poesyes / and falls full vndeuoutlye
to his prayer. He desyereth God without that faith which rises of his veryte /
to spare that rod which he never yet threttened unto manne. For the cross of
contynuall persecucio^s which co^monlye lyghteth upon the elect members of
Christ / are not threttened unto them but promised with his eternal reward /
if they faythfullye bear them Only are plages threttened to the disobedient
brea^e^s of the Lords commandments. And those plages are the very curses
of God / where as persecu^ions for his truths sake are his most wholesome
blessings. Blessed are your (says he) when me^ne reuyle you / and falselye
report you for my names sake. For great is your reward in heaven. A much
better way therefore were yt for Pantolabus and for his bloodthurstye
generation / to leave their murtherynge up of innocents / and to repent from
the heart their manyfolde myscheues past. And that ones done / than to pray
unto the Lord in faith / to withdraw from them that vengeance of innocent
blood she dynge which hangs over their heads as a perpetual plage / rod /
or scourge of eternal dam^nacion. Thus doing they might beccome of publycanes
true Apostles with Matthew / and of cruel murderers faithful minysters with
Paul the elect vessel of God.

2 Charytable would Pantolabus gladlye apere / now that he has spewed out all
his poison and myschefe against y^ true servants of God. A fair color set
they alwaye^ upon the matter / be their workings never so vengeable. And in
that they agree with their spiritual head the serpent / which temptynge Eua /
showed a bewtyfull face outwardlye with sweet and pleasant words. When they
sytt in their consistoryes upon condempnacion of the innoce^tes with Cayphas /
they outwardlye pretend all godliness. They first call upon the name of God
openly protestyng that they have his right honor before their eyes in all that
they go abought. They swear also upon the holy Euangelyes / that they will
there do nothing of displeasure / hate / percyalyte / nor malice. Yet is the
poor innocent in the end condemned / accursed / given to the devil /
disgraded / fyered / and burned / only for his faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ. Never the more is Pantolabus here to be trusted / that he prays so
bytterlye for their conuersyon. For abhomynable is that charity which follows
of so much malice as he has before here uttered / and that apereth by the
filthy fruits thereof. Not unto Christ and his holy verytees would he have
them here with all their hearts to convert / but unto the Antichrist of Rome by
a new obedience of his old cankred customs who^ their lord God does detest
and abhor. This is y^ dissembling charity of this worm of way wardnesse or
maliciouse membre of Satan. This is the conclusion he seeks.

3 Feign would Pantolabus have them to convert to that false obedience of
Antichrist / that he might live like a gentylman and have his dishes the fatter
/ and his purse the waghtyer. Oh / it is a pleasant thing to have the people
on both sides of the way salutinge them with cappe and knee. It is a good sight
/ (say they) when the flock follows the shepeherde / and y^ parryshynes
their curate. yea / but alas what is it when the lambs follow the wolf /
which is a cruel thief / a destroyer / and a murderer? For whose grace would
Pantolabus have Christen men to call? For the grace of holy church / of his
holy father the Pope / of his good lord of Wynchestre / his good lord of
London. His good lords of lyncolne / york and Durham / with soche other
ghostlye fathers. If he means the grace of God / I maruele that he forgets
himself and his own generation. Me thinks they ought in soche prayer / to
be had most in remembrance / consideringe they are fardest of all me^ne from
his grace. if they seek not for it while they have here space and layser / it
will be wide with them when they shall come ones to their straight reakininge.
But they think it safe enough / so long as they have y^ Popes power still in
their hands / with / Ego absoluote under a stulticia a stole I should say. For
if they may give grace unto others / they have grace enough for themselves /
and so have little need of Gods grace.

4 Many a man (they say) shall vttre the thing which he understands not
/ like as Pantolabus does here. And as we have for example of Balaam / king
Saul / Cayphas / and Pylate / which prophesied they knew not what. Dum lucem
habetis (says he) credit in lucem / vt filii lucis sitis. While ye have the
light / believe on the light / that ye may be the chydren of light. This has
he borrowed of the. xii. Chapter of Ioha^ to clought up his matter / yet does he
not know what it means. For if he ded he would not persecute that light as
he has done here most spite fully. The light that is there mentioned is the
lords eternal word / which Pantolabus with soche other craftye cloyners
calls heresye / and would have the people so to esteem it. But y^ light that
he would have the^ to believe / is y^ faith of his holy mother with y^ old
crooked customs of her Papistrye / and that is no light but darkness most
dampnable. Omnis qui credit in me / in tenebris non mane^. Non that believes in
me (says Christ in y^ same self Chapter) abides in that darkness /
meaning therbye the doctrine of hypocresye or of outward obseru^cions
invented by me^ne. This promised he there to cast out with the prince of this
world / by the mighty aperaunce of his word / which should judge those
infidels also at the latter day. The cause why they se not this light nor
behold the misteryes thereof / is that he has blinded their eyes and hardened
their hearts for their vnbeleues sake least they should be saved.

A mysterye.
1 And for this time Here ends my ryme. 2 The Genealogye. Of stynkynge
heresye.
The openinge. 1.
According to the head and body / has Pantolabus here fashyoned us out a
tail. He has given us as folyshe a conclusion / as he gave us a process
before. And for this ryme (he says) thus ends his ryme / as though he were
minded here after to compyle more fumouse works. As for this / it had made no
great matter if it had ended before it began / for any wit / grace / or
good lerninge is in it. For non other fruits it contains but the cruel
contempt of our Christen brethren and abominable pe^^^ertinge of the
scripturs. I call them Christen brethren for the portion that they have in
Christ / whereof no worldly power can depryue them / though they may take from
them both body / goods / and life. For god is of no soche malice as is manne
neither is he displeased always when manne is displeased. But evermore is he
merciful / wha^ he is called upon in faith. He received the thief when all
the world had forsaken him and given him over unto death / much more his
faithful servants which suffers for his veritees sake. The time that
Pantolabus here speaks of is full wretchedlye bestowed / and that he shall
well know / as he shall give the accountes thereof. As for his times what they
are / we need not to describe them. For they every where declare the insipient
head and the Idell brain of their fantastical author / sumtyme to short
sumtyme to long / with barbarouse terms / and more barbarouse matter.

^ What his ryme is in qualite and quantite / and what it contains in length
and in bredthe / he manifests here in these.ii. verses folowinge. Confessinge
them as he should do / to be his own propre goods / and he by them to be a
stinkinge heretyque in deed. For he says that his ryme / which is a fruit of
his own propre popyshe faith / wit and stodye / is the Genealogye of
stynkinge heresye. Ergo he must be a stinki^ge heretyq^ / no remedy. For the
tree in goodness is all one with his fruit / and always the fruit declares
it. For a rank Papyst and Antichrists great frynde had we never known
Pa^tolabus / had not these papysticall Poesyes so vttred and declared him. To
stinkinge a matter is it to go under y^ kings pryuylege Ad imprimendu^ solu^
to y^ utter poyseninge of his people / the Scripturs so shamefullye torn / and
their truth so deuilyshlye perverted. yet is it no m^ruele though this
heretyque Pantolabus does utter soche pestilent poisons / consyderinge that a
worm of that nest and a locust of that lake / can give no^ other commodite.

A mysterye.
1 Vvherin I require. And humblye desire. 2 All men y vvys. That shall read
this. 3 Above all thing. To pray for our king. 4 Domine in virtute tua
letabitur rex, and super salutare tuum exultabit vehementer. Psalm. 20.
The openinge. 1.
LAst of all now comes Pantolabus in ^ his humble requests / as lowlye as the
fox when he seeks his pray / and as false as the fryre when he stodieth to
deceive. But mark his rhetorical style / how manerlye it passes here. Wherein
(says he) I require. That is to say / in that stinkinge heresye (for that
goes inmediatlye before) to pray for the king. Is not this (think you) full
workemanlye handled and like a pregnaunt Poet of the Popes pultrye / thus to
regestre his king in the Genealogye of stinkinge heresye as he calls it. And
to desire his subjects to pray for hi^ in y^ same stiking heresye also?
Abominable is that prayer / which rises out of so stinkinge a desire. Is not
Pantolabus (suppose ye) a pure handed artyficer and a clean fyngered
gentylmanne / that so can polyshe his poesyes? yes verelye is he / and like one
of the scole that he comes from. In the mart that he occupyeth / shall ye
find nonother wares. All that is there done / comes out of stinkinge heresye
/ if antichrist their Pope be an heretyque. For all that they do in their
church as yet / are his dyrtye leauinges / not one obseruacion bournisshed
with the verite of the lord. If Pantolabus has no better thing to bestow
upon his king but a prayer made out of stinkinge heresye / it were best for hi
to keep it still unto himself. For he has no need of that curse of God / for
all their blessings are curses / and their prayers sin after Malachias
Prophecye.

2 Certain / verelye / and ywys comes never into owr meters / but when we
lack matter and wytt to fulfill them / as I told you before. ywys master
Pantolabus the great grounded poet of the Popes greasye gravel pyttes /
requires all men that shall read with a good devotion to Antichrist / this
Genealogye of stinkige heresye (which he has of an idle Idyotes brain
compyled to pondre his good zele unto holy church / and to pray for the
king when they may well intend it. For it is no great good devotion that here
moves him unto prayer that way / but that he must needs say sumwhat though
it were but for manner sake. Great pity were it but the manne should desire to
have readers of his work / it is so notable. As full is it of good Christen
erudicion / as a dogs date is full of sweet honye. How should they be
stinkinge heretyques / styff necked scysmatyques / and obstynate Papists / if
they should not read soche pratye Poesyes among. Let no man think other
wise but that Pantolabus and soche other inte^deth sumwhat by soche subtyle
workemanshippe. The Bisshopes winketh at it / as though there were in it non
heresye / when it is all stinkinge heresye by their own confession. They are
well contented wha^ they play soch bussye parts / and will not be acknowe of
it / but leteth them alone. If any of them leap so far that he is hanged up
for treason / they care little for it / for they think thy have so lost but a
knave.

3 After a far fett style / and curyouslye compassed process / comes
Pantolabus at the last to his full desire. Exhorting all men to pray here
for the king / with as little true devotion as he that myndeth nothing less.
And yt makes no matter neither. For much better yt is to be vnprayed for /
than to be prayed for out of stynkynge heresye / as all their Papistrye is non
other. The prayer which ought to be made for kings and for them that are in
auctoryte / ought to arise of the sacred scripturs whereof they have their
auctorytees / and not out of s^ynkynge heresye as yt is here required. Saint
Paul exhorted Timothe / which was no papistycall mass sayer but a preacher of
the Gospel sufferynge daily persecucions for the same / before all other
things to pray for kings and for all other which were in high power / that
Christ's disciples and true beleuers might live under them a peaceable life in
all godliness. And this is our prayer also with contynuall tears. Wherein we
desire the lord for his eternal mercyes sake / always to preserve him. But
out of stynkynge heresies we pray not for him / neither out of Mattenses nor
Masses / eue^songes nor complynes / which are the very fruits of the Beast of
Rome / least we should by those blasphemouse prayers bring upon him the great
indignacion of God. The fruits are evermore all one with their tree in
goodness / as those filthy obseruacions with their first filthy begynner /
have they never so fair colors of gods service / gods own word / Christ's
Gospel / the vttera^^ce of his name / with soche other / yet are they
abhomynacions unspeakable after that ydo latrouse handely^ge.

4 So far are these blind Papists from the true sprete of Christ / that
nothing they ryghtlye understand of the scripturs. This text of David: Domine
in virtute tu^^let^bitur rex / and super salutare tuum exul^abit vehementer:
Perteyneth alone unto Christ / and not to any earthlye king. For in that
whole Psalm is described his triu^phaunt glory / with his reuengement over
them with has him persecuted of cruel hate and spyght. Christ's humanyte is it
/ that is so joyful of the strength that yt has gotten / which is the
Godhede. That is yt which reioyseth so ernestlye / and is so exceeding glady
for the saving health of mankind which yt has by y^ gift of God obtained. He
has his hearts desire with the full request of his lyppes / which is the
eternal mercy of the Lord. That manhood was prevented with lyberall
blessings / and now yt has a crown of immortalyte. He axed life for him and
for his / and life was given him for ever and ever. Magna est gloria eius in
salutari tuo / etc. His glory is great / Lord (says David) in that saving
health / and compassed he is now of the / with eternal felycite. Soche mockers
as is Pantolabus shall ones feel his hand / ones will he find out all them
that so spyghtfullye hates him. As an hot kyndeled oven shall they at that
day apere / the fire everlasting will devour them for ever ^ot ashamed is
this dissembling mocker and pestylent hypocrite / in his glosynge flat teryes
ydolatrouslye to abuse his Prince. For what is ydolatrye else / but a worship
given to a creature / which peculyarlye belongs unto God. And full thereof is
all the service / homages / and doings of the Papists / the Lord ones
deliver all Christen princes from them.

A mysterye.
1 And the queen also Where so ever she go. 2 And for the sauegarde Of our
prince Edward. 3 Whom I pray Jesus Long to contyne we / Amen.
The openinge. 1.
ERnest is Pantolabus yet still in requests sprynggynge out of his gentle
Genealogye of stynkynge heresye. For therein he homblye requires all these
things by his own confession before. Herin he desyereth the dilygent readers
of his work / to pray for the queen also / which was sumtyme called the lady
kateryne howarde.

He should seem to be some blind chaplayne of hers / by the blind zele he
shows here. For he would have her remembered where so ever she go / in the
way or out of the way. Truly that prayer were of a strange kind / if yt
should so be made as yt is here required. Who has hard prayers made for men
to go where they will / or when they are out of the right way to continue so
still? I think few men living I would have no soche querestre of Baals
quere / nor yet soche a chaplayne of Bells college to pray form / as poor a
man as I am Much better grace parauenture had been hers / if she had chanced
of no soche ghostlye fathers. For where as the scripturs are / contempned / and
their verytees set at naught what else can follow but vice? which always
requires an ill end. The true love of Gods word / is never without his
fear. Never can that creature outragyouslye offend / which follows the true
line thereof. A ^anterne to our fete is that word of the Lord / and a light
unto our pathe ways in this shadow of death / the eternal father give us
his grace to follow yt.

2 Fynallye Pantolabus exhorts all his readers to pray for the sauegards of
our most worthy prince Edward. If this were out of the Genealogye of
stynkynge heresye / as yt is also therein / yt were much more pleasynge unto
God. He abhors all that is strange / and not like fashyoned to the exemplar
that he has left in the scripturs. He turns away his face dysdaynouslye
from all mocking sacrifyces invented by men and not commanded of him. As is
the Papistycall Mass with all other blasph^mouse obseruacions of that
mon^truouse madame / the ^athanycall Synagoge of Antichrist. Nadab and Abihu
the sons of Aaron the high Pressed / were consumed in the Lords wrath / for
offering s^raunge fire uncommanded. Accursed is he which adds his own
inuencyon unto the Lords service / or any thing else that the scripture
commands not. I counsel therefore all faithful beleuers / syncerelye to
pray in sprete and in veryte after Christ's holy doctrine / for their most
worthy king and the prince his natural son / that the one may succeed the
other as Solomon ded David / and as Iosaphat ded Asa / in the faithful ways
of the Lord. And this have they good cause to do if they remember all things.
As their delyueraunce from the great Golye of Rome / with sufferaunce to read
the scripturs which is their syngular sowle^ health. What though some of them
at times be brent in the fire for Christ's testymonye / through the Bisshoppes
old tyranny. Nothing is there lost / but their corruptyble bodies. Whereas he
suffers one body in their malice so to peryshe / he saves that ^owle and a
thousand more by the fredome of Christ's Gospel. Blessed be the Lord
therefore that ever he was borne.

3 I counsel no man to make this prayer with Pantolabus nor with soche other
execrable Papists / so damnablye vain in the corrupt practyses / stodyes /
and deuyses of their wretched hearts / though yt seems very good and godly.
But pray after y^ scripturs with y^ dear heretage of Christ / which is a
church persecuted as he was / and not pampred up here in pride and in vain
glory. It is a congregation not known to the world nor regarded of fleshlye
lyuers / no more than he was known and received of them when he came into his
own. Pray all from within / as that church is from within like as David
witnesses with all the Apostles and Prophets. And let this be your special
prayer for your king and prince evermore. Thu eternal God of our fathers
three distyncte persons in one everlasting Godhede. Thu omnypotent father and
creator of all. Thu eternal son and redemer Jesus Christ. Thu everlasting
holy ghost and conforter equal unto them both / all one God in power /
substance / and nature of the Godhede / for thy tender mercyes sake have
respect unto our king and young prince. And like as thu have of thy
munyfycence and lyberalyte given unto them the imperyall crown and scepture of
England. So grant them to live in thy fear / to walk in thy word / and to
do that is ryghtouse in thy sight evermore. Grant them also Lord with the
sword that they bear / that they carrye yt not in vain / but always to the
ponnyshment of the ill doers / and to the syngular solace of thy faithful
servants. For so is thy eternal will. Thus ought true subjects to pray
without all hypocresye / dissymulacyon / and glosynge flatterye.

NOw should soche a famous work / made in defense of holy church / apere
notable unto the readers thereof / except the name of a notable clarke (as
master Pantolabus is) were putt there unto? fytt is yt that the carpenter should
stand by his carpe^trye / and the buylder by his building. A broken wall of
Babylon has Pantolabus dawbe^d up here of old fauer and love / but his dyrtye
dawb^rye holds not. For like an vnworke manlye dawber he has done yt with
vntempred claye / contrary to all godly admonyshmentes. Most dampnably has
he perverted the sacred scripturs here / to maynteyne his Popyshe malice
against all Christen charity. But Hieremye / Ezechiel / Micheas / and Aba^uk /
with other holy Prophets / byddeth him and soche other to set their hearts
at rest. For the cite which is builded with blood / and the house that stands
by vnryghtousnesse / shall not always continue in the world. I shall cast
donge in your faces ^sayth the Lord by his Prophet Malachias) even the very
donge of your solemn feasts and ceremonies. And yt shall cleave fast upon
you and take you with yt to eternal perdicion. What Ponce Pantolabus is (which
puts himself forth here for y^ Author of this Jest) I need not to describe.
For the very work it self sets forth his lyuelye image. It manyfestlye
declares him a braynelesse babbler / a presumptuouse ydyote / a frantyck Papist
/ a peruerter of the scripturs / a stynkynge heretyque / an enemy to God / a
secret lover of Antichrist / and a preuye conspyrer against his prince for the
Pope.

2 Much according to the right nature thereof / is the settinge out here of
this heretycall Genealogy. Abhominably blasphemouse it is / and therefore it
passes forth under some tytles of abhominacion. It is said first of all to be
imprinted at London / which is a most noble cite. Very sorye I am that soche
sylthye fruits should come from so worthy a place. Notwithstanding I ascribe
not this partycular evil to that worshypful cite / wherein (I know) to be
people most virtuous and godly. But of this am I certain. Though Jerusalem
were holy and the very cite of the lord allowed by the scripturs / yet was
it in conclusion most greuouslye ponnyshed for sufferinge blasphemers / and for
vnthankefullye receyuinge of Christ and his verite. Pater noster was wont to be
a most wholesome prayer / ordained and commanded of Christ to dwell only within
mannys soul / and from thens to be sent in daily massage to the eternal
father of heaven. And now he is becomen an out street dweller) the name of a
lane / or the sign of a tavern. Far is he changed from Christ's first
institucion / and from the office that he appointed him. A far meane^ change
from a pylde popyshe ceremony / would be called a great heresye of y^
Bysshoppes. What this is I leave it to yowr conjecture.

3^ In this Pater noster row / or in bedealleye whether ye will / was this
Genealogye imprinted / at the sign afowr lady pity. What that pyteouse lady
is I can not tell / but well I wot she has no ^ust tyttle to be called owr
lady. No true figure is she to Marye the mother of Christ. For never was she
so far from the right faith / that she sorowed so largelye for that thing
which was unto us all most necessary. I know she never wept so vndyscretely
for the death of Christ / which was owr universal health / but most hyghly
reioysed therein. If she ever mourned / it was for the sins of the people /
and for that she saw his veryte conte^pned of the cruel clergy / as it is
yet still. They therefore which worship that sorrowful pity of Marye / do honor
that infydelyte with she never had / and make them thereof an Idol. Thus is the
sign that Johan Redma^ dwells under / an exercrable Idol / and he for so
magnifyenge her with that tyttle / a very Idol worshypper. The less maruele
is it / that soche filthy fruits comes out of his house. Here is he not
ashamed openly to confess / that he has set his hands to most wicked
Papystrye / and unto an heap of perverted Scripturs / to the great dishonor
both of God and of his king. Adioyninge there unto his pryuylege / Ad
imprime^dum solum / the rather to infect his people.

4 Now follows Robert wyer / and he grants also by his own handye work /
that he has promoted forewarde these Popyshe Poesyes and Scripturs
abhominablye perverted. Wherein he has done all that has lain in him / to
assure the kings faithful subjects to give their good hearts to y^ Popes
old faith. An ungodly cruel way were it / if men ded but mynistre that
thing with should but poison the bodies of the people. What shall we than reckon
it / when that fylthynesse is ministered of them / which infecteth their sowles
to eternal death. Soche is the insatiable thirst of the^ that are couetouse /
that they care not what myschefes they do to get money. If the devil had given
them a matter against Christ / as his sworn Chaplayne has done here against
his true servants / and have monyed them well / they would surely have done
by that / like as they have done by this. And the day will ones come that they
shall find it all one. The kings priuylege. Ad imprime^dum solum / is put to
the same / to bring him also under the self same curse / of God / if any
chance for it at the latter day (whom he defend) so good subjects are thy
unto him. By soche diversity of printes is it easy to perseyue that the sale
has been great and the profyghtes thereof plentuouse. If the work had been
Godly / yt never had gone so frelye abroad / nor with so much fauer of y^
Bysshoppes. The lord ones be merciful to his afflicted famelye / and deliver
the^ from their my^cheues. Amen. The conclusion.

Expreslye is it here to be seane (dear frynde in the lord) what Pantolabus
was at the making of this jest / and what many other are yet still in the
same synefull line of Antichrist. I perseyue by him and soche other more / that
Leuiathan had than great strength in his loins / to send forth soche sturdye
babes. Not long before that they hid their heads / and durst not be seane
abroad. But tha^ ded they on their mothers shameless face / and were again as
bragginge as in their Popes time. Small harm is it to them that the Beasts
head was wounded / it is so well and workemanlye healled up again. Not to
Christ's glory have they fashyoned the^ a new church now after the Gospel
preachinge / but after their own vain glory again yet for advantage.
Destroyed yet utterly shall that execrable mo^stre be within short space (trust
upon it) by y^ only breathe of y^ lords eternal mouth For now does he call
to remembrance the blood of his elect Servants who^ she has slain and
seduced to establyshe her kyngedo^ of lies and abhominacio^s. Now shall she be
subdued of that heavenly verite / who^ she has of so long time suppressed /
the beast peryshinge with her who^ she has worshypped in so many kinds of
Idolatrye. That lord make speed to fulfill his everlasting promise / to the
confort of his electes. Amen.
