Here begins the chorle and the bird

PRoblemes of old lykenes and fygures
Which prouyd ben fructuous of sentence
And auctorytates grounded on scryptures
By resemblau^ce of notable appearance
With moralytees concludynge on prudence
Like as the bible reherceth by writing
How trees chese hem sometime a king
First in their chose they named tholyue
To regne among them (Iudiciu^) does expres
But he him self began e^cusen blyue
He might not forsaken his fattenesse
Ne the fyge tree his amerouse sweetness
Ne the vygne his wholesome carage
Which gives comfort to all manner age
And semblably poets laureate
By derke parables full conuenyent
Feign that birds and bestes of astate
As ryall egles and lions by assent
Sent out wryttes to hold a parleament
And made decrees bryefly for to seye
Some to have lordshyp and some to obey
Egles in thayre highest to make the flight
Power of lions on the ground is seen
Cedre among trees highest is of sight
And the laurere of nature is aye grene
Of flowers all flora ay goddess and queen
Thus of all things there ben dyuersytees
Some of astate and some of low degrees
Poets write wonderful lykenes
And under couerte keep hem self close
They take bestes and fowls to wytnes
Of whose faynynge fables first arose
And here I cast to my purpose
Out of Frensshe a tale to translate
Which in a paunflete I read and saw late
This tale which I make of mencyon
In groos rehersyd plainly to declare
Three proverbs paid for a raunson
Of a bird which was take in a snare
Wonder desyrouse to escape fro her care
Of mine auctours following the process
So as it befell in order I shall express
Whylom there was in a small vyllage
As mine auctour makes rehersayll
A chorle which had lust and great courage
Within him self by dylygent trauayll
To make a gardyn of rich entayll
Of length and bread lyche square and long
Hegged and dyched to make it sure and strong
All the aleys were made plain with sonde
The benches couerde with new turues grene
Sweet herbs with conduytes at the hand
That will hit up again the son shene
Like silver stremes as any crystal clean
The burbyll wawes in their up boyllynge
Round as berell their bemes out showing
Mydde in the gardyn stood a fresshe lauryre
Thereon an bird singing day and night
With shynyng feathers bryghter than gold wyre
Which with her song made heavy hertes light
That to behold hit was an heavenly sight
How toward even and in the dawenynge
She did her pain most amerously to sing
Esperus enforced strongly her courage
Toward even when Phoebus began to weste
Among the branches to her auantage
To sing her complyne and than go to rest
And at rysynge of queen alceste
To sing again as it was her dew
Erly on morrow the day sterre to salewe
^t was a very heavenly melodye
Even and morn to here the birds song
And the sweet fugred armonye
Of vncoute werblys and tewnes draw a long
That all the gardyn of the noise ronge
Till on a morrow when Tytan shone clear
This bird was trapped and caught with a pantere
The chorle was glad when he this bird had take
Merry of chere of look and of vysage
And in all haste he purposed to make
Within his house a preaty little cage
And with her song to rejoice his courage
Till at the last the sely bird abreyde
And sobrely thus to the chorle she said
I am now take and stand under dangere
Holden straight that I may not flee
A deu my song and all my notes clear
Now that I have lost my lybertee
Now I am thrall where sometime he was free
And trust well while I am in dystresse
I can not sing nor make no gladness
And though my cage forged where of gold
And the pynacles of berell and crystal
I remember a proverb said of old
Who loses his fredom forsooth he loses all
For I have lever upon a branch small
Merely to sing among the woods grene
Than in a cage of silver bright and shene
Song in prison has none accordaunce
Trowest thou I will sing in prison
Song proceeds of Joy and of pleasaunce
And prison causes death and destruccyon
Ryngynge of feters is no merry sown
Or how should he be glad or Ioconde
Again his will that lies in cheynes bond
What auaylleth it a lion to be a king
Of beestes all shette in a toure of stone
Or an egle under streyte keeping
Called also king of fowls euerychone
Fie on lordshyd when lyberte is gone
Answer herto late it not asterte
Who syngeth meryly that syngeth not at heart
And if thou wylt rejoice of my singing
Late me goo flee fer from all daungere
And every day in the morenynge
I shall repair unto thy laurere
And fresshely sing with lusty notes clear
under thy chamber or a fore thyn halle
Every season when thou list me call
To be shette up and pynned under dread
No thing acordeth unto my nature
Though I were fed with milk and wastell bread
And with cruddes brought to my pasture
Yet had I lever to do my besy cure
Erly on morrow to scrape in the vale
To find my dinner among the worms small
The laborer is gladder at the plough
Erly on morrow to fed him on bacon
Than some man is that has good enough
And all deyntees plente and foyson
And has no fredom with his possessyon
To goo at large but as a bear at a stake
To pass his bounds but if he leave take
Take this answer for a full conclusyon
To sing in prison you shall not me constrayne
Till I have fredom in woods up and down
To flee at large on bowhes rowhe and plain
And of reason thou sholdest not dysdayne
Of my desire but laughe and have game
But who is a chorle would each man were ye same
Well quod the chorle sith it will not be
That I desire as by thy talking
Magre thy will thou shall chese of three
Within a cage meryly to sing
Or to the kechyne I shall thy body bring
Pulle thy feathers that be bright and clear
And after roste or bake the to my soupere
Than said the bird to reason say I not nay
Touching my song a full answer thou haste
And when my feathers plucked ben away
And my body roasted or baken in paste
Thou shall of me have a small repaste
But and thou wylt work by my counsayll
Thou may by me have a great auayll
If thou wylt to my reason assente
And suffer me goo freely from prison
Without raunson or any other rent
I shall the ryue a notable gwerdon
Three great wysedoms according to reason
More of value take heed what I profre
Than all the gold that shette is in thy cofre
Trust me well I shall the not dysceyue
Well said the chorle tell anon late see
Nay said the bird thou must before conceive
Who shall teache of reason must goo free
Hit sytteth a master to have his lybertee
And at large to teache his lesson
Have me not suspecte I mean no treason
Well said the chorle I hold me content
I trust thy promise that thou have made to me
The bird flewe forth the chorle was of assente
And took her flight upon the laurer tree
Than thought she thus now stand I free
With snares and panters I purpose not my live
Ne with no lyme twigs any more to strive
He is a fooll that escaped is fro danger
Has broke his feathers and fled out of prison
Again to resort / burnt child dredeth fire
Each man be ware by wisdom and reason
Sugar strawed that hydeth false poison
There is no venym so peryllous of sharpness
As when it has of tryacle the likeness
Who dredeth no peril in peril he shall fall
Smothe waters ben oftyme deep
The quayle pype can most falsely call
Till the quayle under the net does crepe
A blere eyed fowler trust not though he weep
Esche we his thombe of weeping take none head
That small birds can nype by the head
And now that I such daungere am escaped
I will beware and a fore provide
That of no fowler I will no more be Iaped
Fro their lyme twigs I will flee fer a side
Where peril is peril is to abide
Come nere thou chorle and herke to my speech
Of three wysedoms that I shall the teache
Give not of wisdom to hastily credence
To every tale ne to every tydynge
But conceive of reason and of prudence
Among many tales in many a lesynge
Hastily credence has caused great hyndrynge
Report of tales and tidings told of new
Makes many a man to behold untrue
For one part take this for my raunson
Learn the second grounded on scripture
Desire not thou by no condycyon
Thing which is impossyble to recure
Worldly desires stand all in adventure
And who desired to clymbe high a lofte
Be sudden turn falls often vnsofte*
The third is this beware both eve and morrow
Forgete it not but learn this of me
For treasour lost make never to great sorrow
Which in no wise may recovered be
For who soroweth for loss in that degree
Rekene first his loss and after his pain
Of one sorrow he makes sorrows tweyne
After this lesson the bird began a song
Of her escape gretely reioyssynge
And remembered her also of the wrong
Done by the chorle first at her taking
Of her affraye and of her enprysonynge
Glad that she was at large and out of dread
Said to him hoouynge above his head
Thou were said she a very natural fool
To suffer me depart of thy lowdenes
Thou ought of right complayn and make doole
And in thyn heart to have great he^ynes
That thou haste lost so passing great riches
Which might suffyse by valewe in reckoning
To pay the raunson of a mighty king
There is a stone which called is a Iagonce
Of old engendered within mine entrayll
Which of fine gold peyseth an ounce
Cytryne of color like garnettes of entayll
Which makes men vyctoryous in battle
And who so ever bear on him this stoon
Is full assured again his mortal foon
Who has this stone in his possessyon
Shall suffer no pouerte ne none Indygence
But of all treasour have plente and foyson
And every man shall do him reverence
And enemy shall do him none offense
But fro thyn hands now that I am gone
Plain if thou wylt for thy part is none
It causes love it makes men gracyous
And favorable in every man's sight
It makes accord between folk enuyous
Conforteth sorrowful makes heavy hertes light
Like topasyon of color sonnesshe bright
I am a fooll to tell all attones
Or teache a chorle the price of precious stones
Men should not put a precious margaryte
As rubyes sapphires and other stones ynde
Emerawdes and other perles white
A fore rude swyne that love draf of kind
For a sow delyteth as I find
More in drafte her pigs for to glade
Than in all the perry yt comes out of garnade
Each thing draws to his semblable
Fysshes in the sea beestes on the stronde
The air for fowls by nature is couenable
And to the plough man for to tylle the land
And to a chorle a dongforke in his hand
I lose my time any more to tarry
For to tell a chorle of the lapydarye
That thou had thou getest no more again
Thy lyme twigs and panters I defye
To late me gone thou were foull over seyn
To lose thy riches only of folly
I am now free to syngen and to fly
Where that me list and he is a fooll at all
That is at large and makes him self thrall
To here of wisdom thyn eres ben half deef
Like an ass that lystneth on an harp
Thou may goo pypen in an yuy leef
Better is to me to sing on thorns sharp
Than in a cage with a chorle to carpe
For it was said of folks years agoon
A chorles chorle is often woo begoon
The chorle felt his heart part on tweyne
For very sorrow and a sonder ryue
Alas said he I may well weep and pleyne
As a wretch never like to thryue
But for tendure in pouerte all my live
For of folly and of wylfulnes
I have now lost all holy my riches
I was a lord I cry out on fortune
I had great tresour late in my keeping
Which might have made me long contune
With that stone / to have lived like a king
If I had set it in a ring
Born hit upon me. I had good enough
I should than no more have gone to the plough
When the bird saw the chorle thus morn
And how that he was heavy of his chere
She took her flight and began again return
Toward him and said as ye shall here
O dull chorle wysedoms for to lere
That I the taught all is left behind
Racyd away and clean out of thy mind
Taught I not the this wysedom in sentence
To every tale brought to the of new
Not to hastily give there to credence
In to time thou know that it were true
All is not gold that shows goldesshe hew
Nor stones all be nature as I find
Be not saphyrs that show color ynde
In this doctrine I lost my labor
To teache the such proverbs of substance
Now may thou see thy blinded error
For all my body poysed in balaunce
Weyeth not an ounce rude is thy remembrance
I to have more poyse closed in mine entraylle
Than all my body set for the counteruaylle
All my body weyeth not an ounce
How mighty than I have in me a stone
That peyseth more than a Iagonce
Thy brain is dull thy wit is all most gone
Of three wysedoms thou have forgoten one
Thou sholdest not after my sentence
To every tale to hastily give credence
I bad also beware both even and morrow
For thing lost of sudden adventure
Thou sholdest not make to much sorrow
When thou see thou may it not recure
And here thou faylest which do thy cure
In thy snare to catch me again
Thou art a fooll thy labor is in vain
In the third thou do rave
I had thou sholdest in no manner wise
Coueyte thing that thou may not have
In which thou haste forgone mine enpryse
Than may I say plainly to deuyse
Thou have of madness forgoten all three
Notable wysedoms that I taught the
The vynetener treats of wholesome wynes
Of gentle fruit boosteth the gardener
The fyssher casted out hokes and lines
To catch fysshe in every fresshe river
Of tylthe of land treats the houere
The gentylman talks of genterye
The chorle delyteth to speak rybaudrye
All one to the fawkone and a kyte
As good an owl as a popyngaye
A doke of the donghylle as deynte as a snyte
Who serves a chorle has many a careful day
A den sir chorle fare well I flee my way
I casse my never hens forth me living
To fore a chorle any more to syuge
Ye folk that shall this fable see or read
New forged tales I counseyll you to flee
For loss of good take never great head
Be not sorrowful for none aduersyte
Coueyte no thing that may not recovered be
And remember where ever ye ride or goon
A chorles chorle is always woo be goon
Unto purpose this proverb is full ryff
Read and reported by old remembrance
A chyldes bird and a knaves wyff
Have often sithe great sorrow and meschance
And who has fredom has all suffysance
Better is fredom with little in gladness
Than to be thrall with all worldly riches
Goo little quayer and reco^maunde me
Unto my master with humble affection
Beseke him lowly of mercy and pity
Of thy rude making to have compassyon
And as touching thy translacyon
Out of frensshe / how that it Englysshed be
All thing is said under correccyon
With supportacyon of his benygnyte
