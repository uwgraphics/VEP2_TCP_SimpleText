conqueste of the said golden f^ese. by occasion whereof grew the cause of the
second destruction of the said cite of troy. is not set in the said book of
Recuyel of thistories of troy. Therefore under the ^tectio^ and suffraunce of
the most high puissant and xp^en king / my most dradde naturel liege Lord
Edward by the grace of god king of england / and of france and lord of Irland.
I entende to translate the said book of thistories o^ jason: folo wyng mine

ne mynusshe any thing other wise than mine auctor has made in Fre^sshe. And in
somoche as the grettest fame and renomme stands and rests in the conquest
of the f^ese of gold / where of is founded an order of knights Whereof our
said sovereign lord is one and has taken the profession thereof / how well
som^e persons afferme and say that the said order has taken his origynal of
the f^ese of Gedeon. where in I will not dispute. But well wot I that the
noble due Philippe first foundeur of this said order / did do maken a chamber
in the castle of hesdyn / where in was craftyly and curious^^ depeynted the
conqueste of the golden f^ese by the said Jason. In which chamber I have been

that wha^ he would it should seem that it lichtend and after thondre / snow and

Here ends the prologue of the translatour*
The prologue of thauctor
THe galeye of mine engyn floting not long syn i^ the depnes of the sees of
diuerce ancient histories i^ such wise as I would have brought mine esperite
unto the port or haue^ of rest / Suddenly apperid by me a ship co^duited by
one man only This man^ anon^ beheld my regard and contenan^ce / Which gave me
title and cause of thought and of abasshement for asmoch as I saw his visage
trist. heavy and desolate. whereof smyton^ with co^^ passion of his envy and
greef As Soon as he rceyuid that j so beheld him by great desir He held him
still and said to me in this wise Man of rude e^gyn what meruaillest thou
Ancre thy galeye here and take thy pen^^ for to write and put in memory my
faites and deeds. The king jupiter of crete was mine old bele fader. and he
engendrid Lacus king of mirmidone. This cacus engendered my fader Eson. I am
jason that conquered the flees of gold i^ the isle of colchos And that daily
labor in sorrow roted in tristresse for the dishon^eur that some persons
hurt and e^pesshe my glory. jnposing to me not to have holden my promys
ane^st medea: whereof thou have red the trouth^. Then^e I pray the that thou do
make aboke unto them that daily speak and impugn my glory may know their
indiscrete judgment. And for tacco^plisshe the same j have chosen the to the end
/ that thou present this present writing unto the fader of writars of
histories / which y^ unto Philip fader and lover of all rertues in his time
Duc of bourgoyne and of Brabant and cet. The which has been in all his time
enclyned / and of grette affection to here and see red the ancient histories /
And to here told the faites of the worthy and noble sometime flourisshing in
virtues in vailyance and prudece for his singnlier pass temps: These words
accomplisshid the ship and Jason vanisshed away. and j abode there pensyf:
But in the end desiring to show the honor and declare the virtues of the said
jason I ancred my galeye and put in writing his faytes / as here after shall be
declared plainly and a long / so tha^ I p^se^te my lytil book unto the right
hye and right redoubted Duc of bourgoyne not presuming mine ineloquence / but
psentyng mine right humble and indigne service Thus ^^deth mine auctor his
prologe And how well that hit is said before this prologe that Eso^ was sone to
Lacus Yet bochace says in the genelagie of gods / that he was sone to
Erictheus the xxx. sone of jupiter / As ye may see more plainly in the xiij.
book of the genelagye of gooddes the xxiiij. Chapter



ANciently the kings and Princes of hye felicite were attendaunt and awayed
when their seed should bri^ge fortfj generation: But when so was that they
might not come thereto. what prosperity they had / Their life was trauersid in
continuell bewayling and they visited temples and oracles unto the co^sn^macion
of their days or unto thenhaunseme^t of thyer oroyson^s / The noble king Eson
of Myrmydone whereof is made mention in the prologue. among all other things
and worldly prosperitees was rightnobly regnyng. Certes he had his Royaulme
mayntened in pees. He had in marriage a right fair lady / but they were long to
geder with onte having generation / whereof their days were full of bewaylyng
and of little plaisir in the goods of fortune. But they were contynuelly in
the temples and oracles: And no thing of their desire befelle unto them unto
the time that the king began to fall ^wexe old biaage. then^e his wife rceyued
of his seed and mlteplied the generacio^ humai^ of a right fair sone. At the
burthe of this sone the noble queen deyd. and wha^ the king month following
they would come and be at his wedding What shall I saye^ said that they would
come / and som^e said uay / And so the soupper passid. And jason was fested
there right long and in especial of the high princes and princesses. And
after congie and license taken and ottroied he returned into his country And
then^e when he co^siderid that time wa^ for to goo to the wedding of Pyrithio^:
by the gre and co^^e^ting of his fader: he arrayed him sfelfe and put him in
point Right nobly. and then^e he went theder and his uncle Peleus with him.
And they made such dylige^ce that they came in short time unto the noble Cite
of Thessalonycque When the king Ixion^ knew the coming af Jason and Peleus /
he went again them and made meruaillous chere unto peleus / but yet he made
right much more unto Iaso^ for the good loos and hye renom^e that he had gote^
in thebes / And mad him to desce^de in his palace. and after brought him unto
Hercules that was there with in a chamber. and re^red him that he would make
and a doube hiknight sayng that it was time / and that his playsit was / that
at the weddlg of his sone he should sytte among the knights. and that hit well
appteyned to him. The right worthy hercules herd gladly the king speak and made
there jaso^ knight with great honor And jason full of right good will opend
hi^ mo^th and said in this manner. Right noble worthy Chosen / and right wise
knight among all other shyning in all ^tue^ hit has plesid unto you / for to
call me unworthy and indigne to be of the hye and comeuded order of knighthode
/ Whereof I thank you with all mine heart / and this noble king also from whom
in party thonour is comen to me / But among all this well and worship I pray
you that hit may plese you ^^ssigne me a place where I may do the faytes
Cheuaulerous and knightly* unto this end that ye have not enployed your time
evil so much to honor and worship me / And that I may in the days of my
yo^gthe ensie we the hye and preysed ^tue^ of you that are the very and sewre
fou^deme^t. upon which my total espoyr and hope rests for to come unto the
works of recome^dacio^ Certes fair brod ^ason / ansuerd Hercules. hit is so
now that I have promoted you unto the dignite of knighthode. I have no
commandment over you / and if it be your desir to hau^te arms and to occupy
you therein. Enquire of the wars of the world. and if it happen that ye put
you i^ arms / beware that ye in the youstes do to no man oppression / and be
ye to all people humble and curtoys. Nature has bego^ne i^ you a man garnisshid
with virtues. the gooddes continue hit.

How the geant ypodanie^ a weyhade and how jaso^^ylide him


Wrth these words peleus came upon hercules and jason And jason a^owed that he
should goo unto the first war that he should here speak of And tha^ one and
other began to devise and speak of the prowe^ fes of hercules. What shall ^ make
you long taryeng / this day passed And the morn came: and this day Py ^ithon
espoused the fair y podame with much great honor: and made the^ so great
chere that Eurichus the head and captayn of the ce^taures was dro^ke^: and in
like wise were their ^^^^ws These (...) were an. c. men that always held hem
^armes for to keep the co^treye of Thessaylle. And they held hem in one place
which was named Molo^e / they were all great and fourmed as giants Wha^ tha^
they were so dro^ke^ as said is / And that the wyn had su^^^ou^^ed hem in
words and ^e^cions as is a Coustume in such a caa^ / and braw^d among he^
self. in so much that Pyrith^o^ with some other began to reuerse their ^^^es
and tables fighting with hem with pottes and platers right long and by such
furour that hercules ne jason the ladies might ne could not set any remedy:
and this batilles dured so long. that euricus and many other of the ce^taures
deperted the^s / disposed for to do and conmise a great outrage as they deed.
whereof they ca^ to late to repe^te he^: for they went and armed the^ hastily
And a^^ thus armed returned unto the weddyng. and in this dro^kenship they
rauisshed the fair Ipodaine out f^o^ all the other Ladies and damoiselles.
and Euricus bare her away upon his sholdres

Than hercules and Iaso^ began to re^ne to take their arms and were sone ready
for to depart And followed aft the dro^kardes that went relyng on all sides in
the feldes. and so sore stewed the^ that they ouertoke the^ i^ a grene field.
and were no more on their side but they two only / how be hit that many siewed
the^ as well knights as ladies and getilwomen^. but that was not far Wha^
the worthy hercules and the noble preu jaso^ had retained these ce^taures. they
had each of the^ a bow which they be^de. and syn they escried all the dro^ke^
ce^taures unto the death: and shot on the^ in such faco^n / that hercules
araught one of the^ named Srineus bitwene the eyes / and with his arowe nailed
hi^ fast unto a tree which stood by hynde him. and the noble Iaso^ smote
another centaure in the nekke with a trenchan^t arowe: and smote him doun^ in
the ^^^ce of one named Suericus / which escried right ^uriously upon hercules
and jaso^. And with this cry all the ce^taures rengid hem against the two
knights and marchid against the^ so troublid that they sone after reculed for
jaso^ and hercules slew thay^ with thayre arowes and with their swer
desfaught with thay^ that they anon^ were dyed with their blood Wha^ the
ce^taures saw the swerdes of hercules and jaso^ so dyed i^ their blood: and
also wha^ they perceyuid their felaws deye so with sorrow ^fore the^: feling
also the la^guisshi^g and ^^artif of their wou^des / som^e there were that put
he^ to the flight. and the other deffe^ded the^ with all their puyssau^ce Than
the noble jaso^ she wid his vaillia^ce meruayllousli for he araught noma^ with
a right struck but he bare him dou^ to the earth: or made his soul deperte fro
the body: and they that abode and saw his swerd tre^chau^t wexe read of the
blood of their felawes were not right well assewred. Certes he defended hi^ as
one that doubted nothing. and so did Hercules ^e blably What shall ^ make you
lo^^ process. jaso^ slew with his own^e hand iiij. gea^ts of the said
centaures named Petreus / do illas / cillarus and Pertones and other moo which
were not so great: and the worthy hercules^^ewe and hew dou^ moo tha^ tretty
and somoche trauailled by the aid of jason and other that he wha^ the place
upon the^ and ca^ to his above. This euricus and his conplices lost the place
and supposed to have fled / but jaso^ smo tha^ among the^ (...) such ardau^t
courage / i^ discharging his sword upon the sholdre on the right side of
euricus. that hit c^tted a two his heart / which fylled^^ deed at is feet /
wherefore the other seeing that were ano^ so discoraged. that they sparklid
abroad / that the most perte of the^ suffrid and let he^ be slain and hewe^
in pieces without maki^g or showing any deffe^ce. and the other fled so^me
here and so^methere Thus was the fair Ipodaine deliured of these vilai^
glotou^s and oultrageous by the hye vail lyance of the two worthy knihgti^
jaso^ and hercules. Whom aft this noble victory they re^drid and deliured
unto her parents and fredes

Great was the loos and preissi^g meruailloussy that jaso^ gate there with the
noble hercules for his ^tue / certes Hercules brought her again to the palais
with great glory / and all the world recom^ended jaso^ reseruid peleus which
deyde for sorou for the great worship that was made to hi^ i^ his p^sece Then^e
began the ladies to reioie the^ self and to chan^ge their sorou ito gladness The
fair jpodaine was aourned and arrayed all new. she slepte that night with her
lordre The night passy^^^ peleus on the morn^ callid jaso^ / and said that
their long soiournyng displaisid hi^. and that he wol de return unto his
co^treye Wha^ jason had vndsta^de peleus / he a^swerd to hi^ and said that he
was ready to deperte at his good plaisir Then^e peleus mad for to sadle his
horse. and ^ the mean while he ladd jaso^ for to take congie and leave of the
king y xion^ of pirithyo^ of Y podaine. of hercules and of many other. ^ after
they returned ito their logyse. but wha^ they supposed to have taken and
mounted on their horses / (...). esquyers ca^ to jaso^ which p^sented to (...)
ij. right fair and exelle^t destriers or horses / that one from the king yxio^^
and that oath from jpodaine. certes jaso^ receyuid this present in gre^e
gladness. tha^king many time the noble king and queen. and then^e he me ^ted on
that one of the same hor^^ offrid that other to his uncle peleus. but he would
never accept hit / and said that he was not digne ne worthy to receive so
noble a p^se^t: and wha^ he had thus said he smote his horse with spores and
deperted and jaso^ followed aft. Certes peleus lied not say^g that he was not
worthy to receive so noble a p^se^t as that was which jaso^ p^se^ted hi^: For
he was a traitre to jaso^. which ente^ded to nothing but for to do to hi^
plasir / o cursid blood. certes this peleus might not res te ne sleep he was so
pensif / how he might bring about to make jaso^ his propre neveu to deye and
to this promouid hi^ e^uye and dis^oyal detractio^ whereof he was full Ha a
right miserable and right disnaturell e^uye hou may these noble me^ and also
other nourisshe the i^ their hertes They that e^cline and give the^ unto these
traytrous meui^ges. may in no manner have rest day ne night. thou liftest he^
up ito hye thoughts of glie. thou makesthe^ to mou^te unto the hiest top by
oultr^ qdau^ce and sur^drie above king and e^perours promising to he^ largeli.
but wha^ hit comes for tacquite the promesses thou castest hem low down and
brekest their necks / Ha a perverse murdrer / how many men and also women
have been slain and ded by thy poyso^s: it is now no need for to bring forth
example of this time present for to approve thy couerd falsenes and how thou ab
usest and deceyuest them that have affiance in the but for to continue our
matter with this hit suffiseth for to see the^de of our history of this said
peleus which gaf him to somoch travail for ^o ymagine and proiecte the death of
his nevewe jason which so much affied and trusted in him.

How jason went for to serve the queen Myrro. and how the king of Sklauonye was
vaynquishid and chaced fro his siege
p Eleus and jason departed tha^ fro Thessalonyque in a morening that one right
triste and sorrowful. And that other right Joyous. and when they were on the
selde Jason as fresshe and lusty began to prove and essaye his horse / and
peleus as sorrowful and trayttre as he was / began to abasshe and ha^ge down
his heed: and syn said to him self in his evil courage. Shall I never come to my
desir / what is this / how shall I do. certes I wot never. shall I murdre jason
/ nay: and wherefore: for treuly for asmoch as I should be ensamed / for murdre
cannot be hyd. not withsto^ding he must be ded certainly. this is the
conclusion. or ellis I shall be put doun^. and leave the honour^ royal / and shall
come to mendicite and pouerte O what mortal pain shall j make him to deye /
it is force: but who shall give him the morsel of death. Hit must be thought on^.
if j require another to do this. paraue^ture he shall have pite of jason for
asmoch as he is in the grace of all the world and shall accuse me / if I do
ordeyne any poyson^ and jason be put thereby to death they that have made and
mixte hit. shall not co^ne keep it secret And al so that more is Jason shall
well keep him self from such poyson^: O what thoughts have I / I see none
other moyen but that I must com / myse this caas with my propre ha^ des. Peleus
conspiring in this facon not knowing how he might exploite for to attain to
execute his da^p nable envy: rode forth all this day unto the even: which
took logg^^ in the house of an ancient lady who^ she receyuyd with great Joy
and jason also. and they fond her covering the table for to feste a strange
knight which she had loggyd for charity

i Ncontinent then^e as Peleus and Jason where alighted from their horse / the
ancient lady made hem to wasshe and sit at table. and the strange knight
with them and seruid hem with such mete as she had: and as they had taken
their refecto^n / jason axid the strange knight after diuerce words. what he
was and what he sought. In troth noble gentilman a^suerde the knight j am of
the rich royaulme of Oliferne And litil servant unto the queen of the contre
that j have named / and j certefye you that in remanau^t of all the world is
no fayrer lady / and also there is none more desolate and sorrowful / for the
mighty king of Sklauonye would have her to his wife for her great beauty: unto
whom she will in no wise accord her self and for asmoche as she has plainly
refused him / he is entrid into her royaulme in arms destroyng all to fore him
with fire and sword he is come^ and has besiegid her in her cite of Oliferne
/ to fore which cite and during the siege he has had many fair victories against
the ayda^ts and helpars of the queen the which in liuering diuerce batailles
unto the Esklauons they have lost and ben sore dimuinsshid of their forces and
strenghte for they have s^ayn of the knights of the said lady a great no^bre
that tho few that yet live dare not nowyss^e out more for to make any saulte
or scar much against their enemies Wherefore the vaillya^t pri^cesse willi^ to
deffende her self unto the death sent into diuerce places her messagers / and
me among the other for tasseble for her souldyours and men learned in the war
for to do her aid against her enemies as well for her money as for to help to
keep thonour of ladies. wherefore j pray you if ye know any in this contre that
hit may plese you / to adresse me to them and ye shall do great charity and to
me great curtosie

i N telling the knight this that said is he could not keep him self from
weping / but wept tenderly. And when jason had vndsto^de and thought a litil of
the necessite of the lady / considering also her great beauty / he wept for
also pite and adressid his words unto peleus and said Dear uncle ye have well
herd this good knight speak / what seems you. To whom peleus ansuerde /
certes fair neue we / Me thinks in mine aduys that the king of Esklauonye does
evil and great syn^e for to war and destroy the country of one so fair
a^lady / and if j had no more charge then^e ye have / without making long
soiourn^ or tarieng: j should go unto the socours of one so noble a lady / And I
ensure and promise upon my troth ansuerde jason then^e that to morn as erly as
I may shall mon^te on horsback and in the company of this good knight ^ shall
go unto this lady. and shall do her all the service and plaisir that I shall
can do and may / for to begyn^e and ensiewe the order of knighthode. wherefore
I pray you that ye reco^^ande me unto the good grace of my lord my fader. and
that ye of your good grace wole often times pray unto the gods for me

w Han peleus had understand the vow of jaso^ / he was right joyous / for he
was in thopinyo^ that he should never retoorne fro this vyage / and that by this
moyen he should be quyte of him with his worship and honor. Then^e peleus
promised to jason that he should acco^plisshe with good heart all that he had
required of him / and syn^ recom^ended him to the knight of oliferne / and
then^e it was time to wythdrawe them wherefore they went to rest unto on the
morn^ and then^ aroos and took leave each of other and thus went jason with the
strange knigt unto the noble cite of Oliferne / and peleus returned unto
myrmydone prayng the gods that jason might be smyten with thonder or through
persyd with v. C. speris / or to be buried in the sea to the end that there were
never moo tydinges of him Such or semblable were the prayers that the peruers
peleus made for the total destruction of his ge^til neue we Jason / the most
adressid knight that ever was in myrmidone. This notwithstanding the noble
jason exployted always his journey and went so far he and the knight that he
brought him and rendrid him in oliferne / and presented him unto the queen for
to serne her in her war / This Queen was called Mirro / which is asmoch to
say as mirror in beauty

When Jason saw him to fore the queen: he beheld her with great entente
enclining him self and making to her reverence And she seeing that he was much
fair and a young ge^tilman^ well made in all his (...) a chiere of a vaillerous
(...) him i^to her wages as a souldyer / a^^ she that had great need to have
such knigtes in great no^bre. but this was not only upon his person but also
upon his hye maintene and behaui^g iuging in hi^ great courage which was notlyk
to any noble man that euyr she had seen / After the p^sentacio^ of jaso^ and
that the fair mirro had retained hi^ in her wages and souldies of her
ordenan^ce. The knight that conduyted him brought hi^ fro the palace into the
toun^ and deliuerid for hi^ a good logys. The fair Mirro had at that time
triews with her e^nemyes for xv. days. Certes these triews anoied much to
jaso^ for he demanded nothing but for to employe hi^ in all faites of arms to
that e^de that he might do plaisir unto so fair a lady / the fair mirro. which
never was out of his mind / for ye shall vndsta^de that syn time that jaso^ had
beholde^ and sec^ the great beauty of the lady / she was wreton^ biloue ^ his
heart so acertai^li that he could never keep hi^ fro thinki^g on her in alowi^g
and preysing. her yonghte / her contena^ice: her wy^ie ^^d all her other
virtues / where with she was e^dowed and adourned and she had no more but xvj.
yer of aage. also he brought to his mind her fair and fresshe color: her
ladly maytiene and her noble faco^n and corpole^te / wherefore he was so esmeuid
and esprised with love that he wiste not what to thenke what thing was him
befalle / and in (...) he was many a day. among these things duringg the ^^ws:
the king of sclauonye sent his propre messager unto the fair mirro for to
requir^ her that she should give audience to one of his knights that he would
send unto her / to who^ he had give charge for to say to her certain secret
things: which audience she aggreed / and tha^ the said messager departed and
reported to the king that the fayt mirro was ste^te for to here his knight Of
thise tidingis the king of sclauonye had much great toy^ / and as he that
somoch bre^de in the love of the queen mirro and wist not what thing should
befall hi / where fore he disguised hi self the best wise that to hi was
possible. and by the ^ouse of certai herb she froted his visage and changed*
his color. and syn took. ^. of his knights with hi who^ he trusted to who^ he
declared hou he would goo unto his lady peramours ^ayn^g that he was a simple
knight of the kings court and deffe^ded hem exp^ssy that they should not make
to hi honor ne reverence. sauf only thonour of a felaw to a felaw / and ano^
as he had a^utifed of that they should do he put hi on the way so secretli that
he c^trid in to olyferne and so exployted that he was brought to for the noble
queen mirro whom he had ne^ sec^ to fore where he knelid dou^ on his knees
right humbly to fore her. and how well as he was all rauisshed in thi^ki^g and
beholdi^g her meruaillous beauty. for he had never seen to fore so fair a
creature / after the reuere^ces there made he said to her in this manner.

Noble and right renoined princess the king of Esclauonie my souerain and
puyssau^t lord recom^andeth him right humbly to your good grace and noble
memory: and for so much as he has vndstonde that ye be co^te^te to here his
dema^d / and that he offrith for the love / for the well: the honor and
prouffit of you and of your roiame. if hit plese you ye shall give me audic^ce
and good expedico^n with these words the ladi conma^ded the^ki^g that he should
stand up as she that wist not what he was / and syn drew a littl a pert.
wherefore the king approuched ner her and said. right vtuouse ^ncesse / ye know
hou by diucrce times your right humble ser uaiit the king of esclauo^te has
re^red you by his barons and c^hassadours that it should plese you to be his wife
and felaw / and always in feet ye have refused him / and for cause of which
refuse as j am advised he has entrid into your royame and assailid it by war
as ye may perceyne / yet always to put him self i^ deuoir he has sent me to
you for to re^re your desired g^ce / as he that has more greter pite of you.
and your^ country then^e ye have your self as me seems: wherefore he re^reth
you by me that at this time ye have pite of your true lover: of who^ the

Land sce^de ye in will for to be his lady and maistresse to the^de that he
may atteine to the chief of his desirs and also to the^de that your cite and
your men may d well iu pees and rest

In pronounsing these or semblable words the dolorous king made many sighs
and began to cauffe and lo sweet in such agonye as he had been a prisoner
presented to fore a juge for to reccyue Sentence of grace or of death The wise
and discrete mirro suffrid him tachiene all his proposicion / And when he had
purposed all that love ensey gned hi for this time She was not so disp^urueyed
of aduis ne of ente^deme^t / but pro^ptly and meurly she made to him this
a^swere Messagyer wha^ j have well understand you / j am all abasshid how my
mortal enmye can or may re^re me of love of my aliau^ce wha^ by his oul^age and

and robbed my land / slain my people / burnt my contre. and yet more in fair
has besieged me i^ my cite of oliferne. and wha^ j have well ouithought these
said things I answer you at this time for all / that j shall rather suffer my
self and al my royaume to be destroyed than in any manner shall condesce^de to
his requests and to his will. Certes madame answerde the king / me thinks ye
be not well co^ceyled. ne ^sidere ye not that your desdayne have been cause of
the death of fyfth thousand men^ / And how have ye no regard that he is so noble
and so puissau^t a king. and that he loves you with so parfait love that all
his desir is not but for to mow come to your good g^ce In troth it apperith
by that / that is said to you that he has more gretter pity of your noble
person of your men and of your desolate Royaume: then^e ye have your self And
therefore madame the^ke ye on these things and beware that by your cruelte and
defaure your good lover and friend if hit plese you / fall not in despair. I
wot never what may e^cline you her to / but if it be that ye will and desire
rather the general and total destruction^ of your royaume then^e other wise.
And by all my gods hit is great outrage and folly that meuith you thereto.

^ertes messager a^swerde the wise (...) unto the ^^^auo^ king* the (...) or
wrastlyng of your words (...) not strong y nouh for to beat doun^ and overcome

this end that all the world know that I say troth / also long als the
soul abides in my body / j shall never have love ne alia^ce unto mine enmye /
and speak no more to me thereof / With this the king was all vainquisshid and
disco^forted of socours: and was so terribly displaisid and angry of aspre and
mortal anger that in a great despair and wa^hope he said to her O fell lady
and most rebel and lest pietous that ever deperted out of womans belly syn
that j must acquit me wha^ I perceive that your sweet courage wole not accord

I me deporte from hensforth for to speak any more of this matter / but j you

fierste With these words the king of Sklauonye departed the^s with a chiere
pe^syf: and returned to his Ooste more desiring to come to his ente^cion. tha^
ever he had be^ to sore. And the sayr mirro lytil setting by his menaces:
began to devise with so^me of her ge^til women in recou^ti^g to the^ the
prayers and requests that her mortal enemy had made to her What shall I say
you more / the triews faylled at time set and espired. And wha^ they were
thus faylled the king of sclauonie more thi^king on the fair mirro / tha^ was
need to him: made his men to put he^ in arms many a day* hoping that they
of Oliferne should come out and make him skarmuches but he lost his pain. for
there was not i^ the cite any man that durst issue out for to assayble the^.
for asmoche as they had always against he^ the worse. and tha^ wha^ he knew
that they of oliferne were so cremeuse and rebouted and durst not come out / he
chose o^ a day fyfty of his knights. and said to the^. that for the love of
his lady he would just again the^ all. one aft an other / and syn brought he^
unto a place propice for to just in / which was right fair in the sight for
them of the cite. and there began they to just making so merueyllous abruyt
that they of olyferne herd hit ano^ and ran unto the vateilleme^t and lowpes
of the walls. Iaso^ went for to see these ioustes with the other and anon as
he saw the manner of the Sklauonoys he had grtee sorou in him self: and by
meruaillous courage he went to the palas to fore the fair mirro / And after the
reverence made / he said to her. my right redoubted lady I can not have
meruaille enough of the great ^southe and lachenes of your men / for j have see
your mortal e^nemyes devise and just right nygh to your cite with a litil
^panye in such wise as oliferne were dispourueyed in all points of men^ and
of deffe^ce / Ha a madame what is this* Certes all they that been therein receive
great blame: and therefore I pray you for your honor and also myu^ that ye will
delivers mex. of your soldiers: and that it plese you that I may conduite
the^ upon your enemies / and if ye would so do j suppose that we shall make
affraye to the^ as great as they had any long syn. The fair Myrro hering the
request of Jason allowed much his good will: And inquired of him the nombre
of her enemies. and when she was advertised that there were nomoo but fifty /
she se^te for xij knighthes which were newli come^ fro the cite of damask to
who^ she declared the request of jaso^ / and axid of the^ if they would
adventure he^ with him. They beheld jaso^ and seeing his mayntene and that he
was the best adressid knight that every they had seen / and that his request
departed fro a right noble courage They a^swerde that they would aco^panye him
unto the death. Then^e the noble maid heering what they said accorded to jaso^
to enterprise that he had required of her. Wha^ Jason perceyuid that his
request was accorded to hi^ He thanked the fair lady with good heart / and
after recom^anded him unto her noble prayers After that he re^red the xij.
knights that they should speed the^ to put he^ in point promising the^ good
adventure / This don they went and armed the^ / And mou^teth^ upon their horses
/ and wha^ their helmes and sheldes we^ laced. They did do^ open one of the
gates of the cite which they held co^tinuelly closed for all doubts and
aualed the draw brigge. and they rood out in to the field / and jously rood
against the esklauons: which as saydis were jousting again their king by solace

When the noble Maid mirro and the ladies knew that jason was on his way.
they monted upon an hye tour, out of the which they might plainly see i^ the
ooste of their enmyes: and they tarried not long. Wha^ the king of Sklauonie
had perceyuid jason and his fela was which came to him ward: wherfor^ he left
the ious ting and callid his knighthes. to who^ he said Fair lords ye hane
made upon my body an esproue of Chyualerye for the love of my Lady. but now
thenke ye for to get honor and laud for the love of me / and procue you
myghtly upon this lityl uo^bre of knights Olifernoys that come upon us / we
be^ four against one. wherefore we shall put he^ to death also lightli as the
lyo^ deuoureth the la^be with his teth and claws With these words the noble
jaso^ and his felawes assewrid on their horses took their sheldes which were
fast bonde^ to their breasts bra^disshed their speris and escryed their enemies
/ which broched their horses with their spores and receyuid the^ and
recou^trid with the might of their speris and so asprely assailed the^ that it
seemed that they should have ^fou^ded the^ to fore hem (...) when hit came to the
troncho^^^g of their speris. Jason that hest was horsid of all the other
receyuid the first struck And with his spear he was atteyned of the king of
sclauonye by such a might / that he ^cid the shield (...) the right side. and
there he brake his spear. and Jason smote him on the somette of his shield by
such a ^^^ht. that he made him to reuers^^^s heed and made h^ to hurtle agan^
the cruper of his horse by hind so astoneyd that hie feet were lift upward
that the rayn of his horse brack and fill down from his horse unto the ground
/ the which horse than Ran astraye into the field. than passid forth Jason
right Joyous of his good adventure. A^^ with another spear that he had taken of
his esquye^ ^or to fulcome his empryse. came and reco^^trid one of the best
knigh (...) of sklauonye / to whom he gaffo desmcsurable a st^^ke in the mids
of his shield. that he percyd hit and the hauberk and haqueto^ in to the body
in such wise that he fill down deed fro the horse to the earth. And than they
sinote to gyder on both ptyes by the stre^gthe of their speres well sharped
with stele. And for the great nombre of the sclauons that were there in Regard
of them that recou^trid them So^me left the stour and went for to conforte
their kin^ / which lay on the earth all asto^ed and as ded And the other
intended for to furmisshe their enemies Thus began the bataylle fires aspre and
Regoro^use as wele^ with speris that sone were tronchonned as with good
trenchaunt swerdes. and they of Damask maynted them so hyely by the example of
noble Jason / that with iousting they vare down. vj. of their enemies / Of
whom four were deed on the field and the other ij. were so hurt in the
falling that they nughtneue ^^^pe he^ self after

Ye may well vndstande that this stour began aspre and meruaillous The Esclauons
set their king on horsebak again as well as they could upon one of the horses
of them that were deed. and then^e all they set hand on (...) werdes / and
came for to entre^e ^e with jason / and them of this company / smyling on them
so dismesurably that jaso^ knew anost that he should be ssayn. if he defended
h^^^t with all his power And then^e concluded in his courage that er he left his
life he would make his Renommee grow in Olyferne and in Esclauonye: or he would
deye in the (...) / with that he hau^^^^ his (...) enchaunt swerve of ^^^le And
di^hargid hit upon the heime of a Esclauosi by such vtue that he clefte his
heed unto the ^^rayu^ / that he f^^ doun^dede fro his horse to the earth. and
in passing further he smote an other in the presence of his king / by such
force that he cut of a quartre of his shield: and his lift atine with all /
And when the king apperceyuyd that Jason departed such strokes he had doubt
of his person / And that was no great meruaille. then^e as worthy and
vaylliau^t as he was he escried jason to the death. And syn came to him with his
trenchu^t sword enhau^sed / and smote him so myghtily upon the top of his
helm: that he made the sparcklis flee out. and his head to enclyne low
dousi: whereof he was notlityll astoned. but escryed him sayng. Vaissale ye have
well shewid to me: how ye can recountre a man with the spear. but I shall she we
to you the sharpnes of my sword / and thou that I am beter knight then^e ye:
And if ye escape fro my hands without receyuyng of death / I will well that ye
say to my Lady paramours the fair Mirro / that her love and friend of
Sklauonye has neither force ne might

How the king of sclauonye was vaynquysshid by Jason in the field by bataylle.
Oche was Jason desplaysaunt when he had understand the vauntises of his
mortalt e^nemy But wha^ he knew that he was the king of sklauonye / he was
well joyus for to know hi and thus said to him by derisio^ Ha / a right
oultrageous fool Art thou he that art affoyled with the blanch feures for
cause of my right redoubted lady / Now see ^ well that in the is more of
p^sumpcion: than of vayllyau^ce: and of vauntise tha^ of fayte and truly more
of folly than of wysedom For hit is parfayte folly to the for to name the
better knight than j am: Than late us see who is the better. With these words
they began again to smite each other right asprely / Certes Jason prouid him
self right fiersiy in gyuing to his e^nemye many strokes terryble and poysaunt
/ And so many gaf hi in making reed his swerd of the Esklanon king that the
right malerouse king was constrained to cry and to kalle his knights unto his
aid and help / but there came so many that Jason was enuironned and assailed on
all sides

When te noble jason felt him self so aduironned on all sides by his enemies
/ He was more reco^forted than to fore / And began to smite with his good
sword of steel on the right side and on the lift side by such virtue and
might: that the ladies of the Cite knew him among all other: and perceived
that he skarmusshid with his sword all dyed with new blood now here / and now
there: And after saw him cut of heedes ^^^^es and legs and fystes And made
arms at his will and more then^e all the remena^nt. And certes by his mayntene
he seemed better a thing of that other world then^e an humayne person. And fro
this time forth on the fair Myrro see^^g this that said is / took jason sol her
good g^ce / that unto the death she louyd him above all other knights* as she
that setted her love totally in him: The noble Jason fought then^e vailliau^tly
again the Esklau^^s. and right long endured the bataylle And when the xij.
knights of damask saw the great prowess and dangerous stour that was about
their maistre They smote in among ^h^^ that so assailed him And then^e enforced
him Jason for to make him self to be of valor / truly by such ardeur of
courage that he slew ther^ t^^ of the most hardyest knights of all the hooste
of his enemies wherefore the king of Sklauonye seeing his mayntene and the
valeur of jaso had such fureur and dread. that he habaundon^ed the place and
his knights that then^e all weary followed him. And then^e the noble Iaso
^^^^wed the chaas and chaced (...) unto the great cost in such confusion and
mo^al occision^ that of the fyfty knights that were at the beginning of the
battle there escaped no moo but ten But tey were all slain and detre^ched or he
we^l pieces And of the party of jaso^ there bleef no moo but tweyn^ upon the
field And of the remanasit all were hurt that one more a^guisshously then^e
that other

How jason was joyously receyuid of the queen Mirro of Olyferne and hou ^they
be waylled each other
AFter this meruayllous bataylle* and that the worthy jaso had rechaced his
enemies unto nyghe by the ooste as said is he taryd for two resons The first
was for as much as he ^owe his felaws weary and sore payned by their wounds /
and the second was for as^noche as he saw the Ooste ^^^ue for to come upon
them / and than as wise and discrete he withdrewe hi sayng that more to worth a
good retrayte^ than a folisshe abydinge: and ree^trid with great honor and
glory into the cite: whereof the fair ^^yrro was as joyouse as she could be /
and co^trayre to this was the king of sclauonye as sorouful and a^gry for the
great damage that he had suffryd that day. Every man ^^olyferne as sone Jason
was reentr^^ sie wed him and man women and children blessid him sayng one to
another that they had never seen none lyk (...) him in beaulte ne more
vaillyaunt knight of his body: and than all the Cite began to ^eyoye^^ when the
sayr myrro thought that Jason was unarmed* she sent for him: and he came gladly
to her / for that was al his desir. than wha^ he was comen to fore her / he
sale wed her / and she rendrid to him his sale we. and syn demanded him hou he
felt him self and how he ferde. Certes madame a^s werde jason to god begyue
the tha^king I ne feel on my body but all good disposicion: and am ioyously
returned into your cite and as to the regard of your enemies / by that I have
felt of the^ me thi^keth that they ought not fore to be dredde ne doubted / and
that in short time: ye shall have of them good rayson. I have this day made my
swerd reed i^ their blood. whereof their king your mortel enemy has had great
dueyl and soro we / And I have yet good will that to morn^ I shall redouble
that. and yet that shall be worse to him and to his if the goodd be in mine aid
and help

Whilis that Jason spack thus to the noble lady as said is. she beheld him
now and now by right great ardaunt love. and could not absteyne her self. for
she was so surmounted with love at this time that for to hyde her will and to
refroide and cole her alityl without more speking to jason: that she left him
with two damoiselles for to entretene and tarry hi and she withdrewe her ito
her chamber / where she began to think on the grette virtues that were in
Jason / That is to wete on his hye prowess / on his fair chiere. on his
laughyng eyes: on his well made body. and on his gracious speking / And so
much she thought on him that she must come again unto the place where he was
Then^e she fonude in the halle of the palace plente of her friends / and of the
most noble of the cite / and there was newly artyued a messager of the king of
damask. that certyfyed to her: that that euenyng should come unto her aid. ij.
thousand assyrie^s / which the king his lord had sent to her in the conduyte
of his brother named Prusius which was a right vaily a^t knight in arms. Of
these tydi^ges was the noble queen much reconsorte (...) and commanded that
they should ordeyne well for hem to ete and drink: and did do couere the
tables and received this Prusius right solempnly / but when each was set at
table / the fair myrro and Jason were in such wise seruid by the refection of
love: that they took none head of mete ne of dri^ke: The messager of love that
is to wete / doulce Regard was co^tinuelly on the way / that on was shamefaste
and changed color. and in like wise did that other. Jason could not conteyne
him self. and Mirro perceived well ynow his mayntenyng. ^ut myrro was much
subtle for she beheld him raysonably / and more did by wisdom than her
heart desired: In these regardes and in these semblances they passyd the
soupper. there was no lady ne damoisel le that ne employed her eyes for to
behold Jason for his great beauty / what shall j say more. aft the soupper hit
was ordained: that on the



In these or semblable ymaginacio^s the Esclauon king passid all this night
unto the morn erly: that Corfus a meruaulious Geant born in Toscane ca^ unto
him / and demanded hou he ferde / and how hit stood with him / Certes corfus
answered the king. For so much as I dreme of my loves / And that they occupye
me so sore / that they ssee me because I occupye he^ so much: and how well that
j find in her but reffuse and fierstee. and how said corfus. thenke ye yet
on her ye said the king. That must needs be. Must hy^ needs said Corfus. Ye
certes aid the king. Tha^ said corfus / ye be a fool and right evil aduysed /
For all thing considerid he is not wise that e^forceth^ him to have a wife
above his degree for as much as there be^ of other ple^te. Right well said the
king / ye say right well: but know not ye that som^e one is better and more
worth than so^me five honderd. Certayuli my ladi is the oultrepasse of al other
ladies. ought j to leave her for her reffuse / ye said the geant if ye do
w^sely. by my law said the king (...) shall never befall me for to dey^ the
pain as her true seruau^^ / (...) that I hope to come to thaboue of mine
enterprise how that it be. ^^yre said Corfus. I report me unto your symplesse
But and ye will believe me ye shall begyle her well / Ye shall leave her for
such as she is said the geant. and never whiles ye live lone never woman but
for one ny^^^ye may every day have a new there is non^ so great playsir as for
to change often. Ha a corfus said then^e the king / a treu lover vseth^ never
such terms as ye speak of / and when a prince may come to the love of a lady.
fair / true / discrete. and a of good house. is not that ynough^ for him. if
he that cometh^ to such felicite and goth^ to change: certes he is worthy of
reproach: Sire said the Geant Corfus. ne know ye no more then^e ye say and
show: Certes there is well another point / and what is that said the king / I
shall say you said the geant Corfus: Take ye the fairest lady that liueth^ /
and be as amourous over her as ever ye can or may / Anon as ye have e^ioyed
her as lytill as hit may be / ye shall be weary and full of her / she shall seem
to you foul? and yet more I shall say you that sone yet shall wisshe her brend
And if ye be as other men be ye shall leave her* and take an other if hit be in
your puys^^unce

A a Corfus said then^e the king if j should believe your counceyll. I should
never do well / and as to the regard of me j wene that ie say to me these
thi^ge^* for to make me return into my country to the end that ye goo not to
the field against them that yesterday shed my blood / by miloyaulte said
theu^e Corfus / Sire all that I have said proceeds nor for any fere ne dread
/ that I have of all your enemies But I counceylle you to my true power: for
asmoche as me semeth^ hit couenable for yowr health and prouffyte. And to
the end that your wenyng be founden vntre we with out more delay. I shall
send your messager unto the noble que ne Myrro / for to signefye her / that
for to mayntene the noble mestier of arms / I offer my self allou^ against
viij. the best knights that been in the Cite of olyferne / for to fight in
champe cloos as hit apperteyneth. in such a caas

When the king of Skla^onye had herd that a^suer of the geant. and perceyuid
that he was angry: he held his pees so long / that the geant went and armed
him in his tente / And syn put him on the way to ward the. cite in the company
of a messager of the kings. whom he sent unto the Queen Myrro right in such
wise as a fo / re is said / and when the messager had said that he had in
change The noble queen callid the more part of her knights and declared to
them that the Geant had demanded / A none as they of olyferne had herd the
contenue of this mandeme^t. For as much as Jason and plente of other knights
strau^giers that were there gaf the honor for to speak first to them of the
same contre for to say their aduis of this work They say / de all on hyhe
that this geant Corfus was he that by his force and vayllau^ce had put to death
the most part of the noblesse of olyferne. and that them seemed hit should be
great folly for to furmisshe the bataylle that he demanded. but of this answer
were all the knights strangers so abashed that they concluded to be
co^d^^ted by the knights of oliferne Reseruid the noble and preu jason the
which as he that might not le^gher hold his noble courage to speak but said
with so hyhe a voys that he was well understood of all men in this manner

Hayr lords displese you not. if the vtue of my courage know not now the
feblesse of my body / j know rigght. well that I am not great ne me^brrd as a
geant. nevertheless I will well that hit be known that there is no gea^t that
has gretter heart then^e I hane / And to this end that it appear euyde^tly.
and the noble lady where my heart and all my well Resteth^ / may always here
good tydinges of me / j enterprise for to fight against the geant Corfus man
for man^ / and j shall never rest unto the time that I have prou^d my self
against him Then^e the noble ladi the queen that tho was present having herd
the^terprise of the noble jaso^ / was so utterly smyten^ with sorou. that her
seemed that she was smeten^ with a spear a trauers the heart so much she louyd
jason / nevertheless she held good contenan^ce. asmoche as to her was passible
/ And incontinent as Jason had declared there his courage / She said to him /
Iaso^ fair sire be ware what ye say: and see that yongthe abuse you not / For
if ye were you. xx. armed and in point for to fight know ye for trouth^ that
he should never leave but abide you thawh^ ye had sworn^ his death ^ Ertes dear
lady said jason: know ye that if yongth^ abuse me / oultrequydau^ce and
presu^pcio^ deceyueth the Gea^t / For to sse a man^ hou great or puyssau^t that
he be / there behooves but one stroke well set. But whether hit be of yron^ or
of steell or of any other thing j doubt not but hit shall come to point. When
the noble Queen Mirro had understand this that Jason said / She wyste not
what to a^swere What shall I make you long tale he did do be said to the
messager of the king of Esklauonie. that he would befighte the Geant Corfus /
And then^e when the noble Jason was armed wyth^ his arms / he mounted on
horseback and his spear on his thye. and so departed fr^ the cite And adressid
hi^ toward the gea^t which was right subtle in the fayt of arms and of the
war. he had all his harnois trussid and his horse sadlid and brydlyd

^nco^ti^^t as the gea^t perceyuid that ^he va^lliant prince jason came ridi^g
unto him / he sterte upon his horse and came to ward him: and by great felonnye
said to hi^. what sekest thou. to whom jason said / Art thou corfus / Ie
answered corfus. j am he trewly Than know thou that thou art he that j seche /
Thou said corfus. ye trewly said Jason / and what meuith^ the so to do said
corfus / co^siderest thou not the strengeth and force of my body and the furour
of my sword / and how I am cause of all the desolacio^ of olyferne: if me
good semeth^ I shall sese the by the heed and break thy neck. as the neck of
a che ke^ / Thou tellest me meruaylles said jason for to fere and abasshe the
people / but for all that my courage cha^geth^ not / our process en dureth^ to
long. go thy way and feche thy spear. and than show what thou can do: thou
have found a man for to furmisshe the / lityl speking and well werki^g. The
geant wyth^ these words went for to fecche his spear And jaso^ couerd hi^
with his shield assewring him self i^ his sadell. And when he had so don and
saw that the geant smote his horse with his sporis and ca^ against him: he roode
to ward hi^ so corageously. that hit seemed more lyk thonder desceending from
heaven tha^ any other thing / and so smote the most fiersly that they could or
might: and their strokes were so peysau^t and heavy that the sengles of their
sadles brake in so much that the noble Iaso^ was born unto the earth / and the
geant was reuersed with the sadle under the crupe of his horse / and of the
peysanteur of the two great strokes the raynes of his horse faylled / and his
two legs behind in such wise as he tumblyd the head under and the feet
upward at right great meschief

Many knights of Sklauonye and of Olyferne were greatly abass^id when they
apperceyued that jason had received of the Geant Corfus oon^ so heavy and so
grette a struck with out deth^ or mayme / Jason and the Geant so born^ to the
earth and set a foot. as said is Releuyd them self anon^ in their standing
and marchid oone against that other / Then^e the strong Gea^t drew his good
swerd out of his shethe. and escried jaso^ sayng. Vaissale or felawe thou have
done to me now the most grettest dishonor that ever h^append or came to me.
And therefore keep thy self from my faytes the best wise thou may. for if the
arm with the good swerd faylle me not at this time: j shall co^sounde the in
short time. And after I shall drink thyn blood and ete thyn heart in despyte
of the dueyl and sorou that thou have done to mine her te. Ha a tyrant felonnous
and oultrecuydan^t a^swerde the noble preu jason / what evil would thou do
/ if hit held at no man^ / but at the. Certes hit happeth often times that
such menaces ben said of great fere and dread And al is done for to save his
life / But to the regard of the and of al thy menaces j make no compte net
doubt the in no thing. And in that thou say / of drynking my blood* and
etyng myn^ heart I shall keep the right well by the aid and the help of the
gods for to fall in such j^h^^anyte or furour / And j hope where I have
angered the in thyn herte*that hit shall not be long to but that thou shall be
angrid in heart in body / and in soul. Than that corfus the right cruel gea^t
had understand the words of jason he left up his heed and chyn a^^ chargid
with here* like a Beer / and after enhaunced his trenchan^t swerd: with a great
Courage right angry and smote Jason and gaf him so terryble and poyssaunt stroke
that he bare a way more than a grette quarter of his shield / And wha^ the
noble preu Jason felt him so smeto^: of the Geant: he left up his swerd a
heyght where with he araught his mortel ennemy / upon the coppe of his helm in
enployeng all his might / that the Geant was constrained to enclyne his heed
all low. Whereof many had great marvel

As ye may understand the two Cha^pyons began to entretaste each other with
their trenchau^t swerdes All way the gea^t after that he had receyuid this
peysau^t struck: he haunced his hand with his sword* again and supposed to
have sineto^ jason: But jason which was light and delyuere and well auised i^
his feet drew him a part in such wise that the stroke of^ the gea^t fylle on
the earth so deep. that if h^e had araught him plainly / he had confounded
him: Than the preu Jason which had so voyded him fro the struck stepped to the
geant: And gaf him such a stroke upon the right sholdre that he brake his
hauberk: and made him a great wound Than jason withdrewe his sword all
blody. And when Corfus the strong geant felt that jason had so hurt him
Certainly he went he should have goon out of his wit: for asmoche as he saw
the sword of his aduersarye* was dyed with his blood / and was much angry.
But jaso^ set little there by. Saving he began a lytil to smyle and law / And
if he was glad so were they of Olyferne / that beheld the bataylle of the two
cha^pyons / But hit was notlong after but their lawhynges changed into wepynges
/ For the geant as all despayred Ran upon Jason so egrely / that he wist not
how to save him / on that other side he saw his shield all i^ pieces And with
that he gaf him a wound upon the lift side that the blood ran dou^ fro the
wound largely: Right long fought the ij. right vayllya^t champions that one
against that othre in so much that they detre^ched and brak theyt sheldes by
fine force: hit was a good sight to see Jason the noble knight how he delivered
again the geant Corfus so meruayllous bataille gyuing to him so much trauaylle
in poursuyng him so besely that the Geant began to wax weary in suffering so
many strokes: and began strongly to sweet. Than for to refress^e him self / he
must needs depart and leave to fight and smite Jason and to with^drawe him a
part / When the worthy Jason apperceyuid the manyere of the Geant and that he
sought for to rest him. he had great yoye: how well he had as gladly rested
hi^ as his aduersayre had / wha^ he considerid in him self: that he might rest
him and ease him. and that he was not hurt but in one place / he* approached to
the geant and said to hi^ / Ha / a right miserable tyrau^t. Approach the toward
me and late us perform and make an end of this bataylle now bego^ne. I
perceive now right well that a bed for to rest the on / should be to the
more play si^: then^e should a bataille or a stout to be furmisshid. but I
advertise the that hit behooves us to come to the end of our entrepryse. And
that there is no remedy. and know that my courage hath^ brought and conduyted
my body unto this point / But from he^s forth my body shall conduyte hit by the
vtue of love / by which me thinketh^ I feel my puissaunce redouble / when that
I remember her. which above all other ought to be best belo^id of me. As she
that is verayly withouthe any exception

Incontine^t that Corfus the crimynell Geant had understand of the noble
damoiseau jason that he was so amerous he began to say to him by great malice:
Certes right gentill knight / j perceive right well that your heart is prysone^^
the mercy of some lady: I require you in the name of her / and by the faith
thai^e owe to her: that ye come and rest you beside me a lytill. And we shall
deuyse us to geder of our auentures Ha / a right recreant and weary ^ybaulde
ansuerd theu^e the noble damoiseau jos^. Thou sekest nothing more but for to
rest the. And if j accord to the thy request. hit is to mi p^iudice for thou
may no more. Notwista^ding in the name of my right hygle maistresse I am
content to do n^ thou have required: But be ware that thou rest not long: With
these words the Geant Corfus and the noble jason satte doun^ upon the grass:
And after they began to deuyse and the Geant corfus said to him Right gentle
knight as j understand ye ben amerous. Hit may well be said Jason / Of whom
is hit said the Geant / of a laydy said Jason: What is she said the Geant.
The most fair of all fair a^swerde Jason Ye said the geant as to your
semblaunt The world i^geth her so a^swerde Jason. Ha. a sir knight said the
Geant. ye be a great fool. for pereuenture ye saw never your lady: And ye say
and name her for the most fair of all other: and yet that worse is. ye hold
her for youris / and hit is possible that she is longyng to moo that an ho^derd
/ How many ben there of the^ that been not double: I louid not long syn a lady
right fair to mine advise. But she is foul right terrybly. Men preyse and allow
much the fair Mirro. But I trow who beheld her well round about / there
should befounden some what of Reprehencion: Ha a right disloyal traitre a^swerd
jaso^ / how darsi thou by thy grette oultrege to thenke evil upon the flour
of all ladies / which had so much / of bounte / of beaulte / of wit /
And which is garnisshid of so many. hyhe and noble virtues: and is a very
myrrour unto all other / wherefore by the faith that I owe unto love er ever I
ete or dri^ke thou shall abye it / Stand up lightli^^ thy feet and keep the
from me if thou think good.

^He noble and gentil knight Jason aroose with the words all enflamed of ire
and maltalent. And took forth with his swerd that lay on the grass all blody
/ The Geant roose also / but hit was not lightly: For his legs were Royde
like a a voyager. that had all the day to fore have voyaged or goon a Journey
/ and than Jason came and smote him upon his lift arm and so employed all his
puyssau^ce that he departid the arm fro the body in^uche wise that he fill
down to the earth. Than the geant by right aspre distress made a meruaillous
and right horrible cry. After this as one full of a terrible courage haunced
his sword swering by all^ his gods that he would avenge him / but he wiste
not hw he might sewe Jason for so much as he was light and deliuere and abel
well knowing the tour of his strookes in such wise as he always defended him
vailliau^tly and distourned the struck of his sweid That his enemy sought all
way and could never attain to reche hi^ / And i^ this wise the bataille dured
long in so much that the son began to deuale in to the weste / But the no
blepreu Jason among many strookes enuertued hi^ self by such vailliaunce in
smiting upon the Geant corfus with his trenchan^t sword / that he araught him
on the highest of his helm / iij. strokes one aft^ an ot^ in oon place that at
the third stroke he enfondrid and to frusshid his helm and the coyffe i^to
the heed. in such wise that of the great a^guisshe that the geant suffryd:
that he fylle doun^ a swou^ne vpon^the sand seeing all they of oliferne: And
of that other part the Esklauons which were soroufull and abasshid

Incontinent as the worthy Jason had slain and smyton^ doun^ the geant to the
earth as said is. he dishelmed him. but he foude that he was deed / wherefore he
left him there lyeng. And in sign of victory he seasid his sword. and after
went unto his horse. whom he found pasturing. But he had no leyser to sadle
him because of many Esclauo^s that he saw meue for to come and re^ne upon him.
Then^e he seasid his horse by the brydel: and without sadle sterte upon him:
And for all doubts he withdrewe into the cite as soon as was possible for him
/ Whereof the Esclauo^s had right great despyte / And than when they
apperceyuid that they gate naught in poursuyng of jaso^ for they were all a
foot / they withdrewe h^to Corfus who^ they foundeded: for whom they were
greatly disconforted in so much that he^ seemed that all her trust and hoope
was lost and goon. And among all other when the king knew the mysaue^ture of
his geant / he was so soroufull that of all the eue^ after he ^not^ d / For he
had great (...) strength: in his great hardynesse (...) in her entrepryse

ORete and meruayllous was the sorrow that the king of Esclauonie and his men
demened for the death of the strong Geant Corfus. And on the contrary the
noble Queen Mirro and all they of the Cite of oliferne demened great joy and
made right joyous chiere for the noble victory of the vaylliaunt Jason. Than
the noble queen Myrro acco^payned of a great nombre of ladies and of
damoyselles of knights / and s^nyers came to the gate against Jason esprysed
with such gladness and consolacion^ that hit can not bespoke^ And anon as the
noble knight Jason espied her / he sprang down of his horse and made to her the
reverence. and after presented to her the swerd of the geant Corfus. and said
Madame ^o here is the swerd that your knights hane so much doubted here to
fore. behold hit well / and do with all your plaisir / Than the noble and
fair lady a^swerd to jason Right exellent knight. thanked be the godd that by
your hyhe e^tre prise and vaillan^ce have this day deliuerid the cite and all
the people of olyferne of a meruaillous dread and fere. and syn that the
crymynuell Geant corfus is deed All the remenaunt as who sayth^ is as goods
as vaynquissijid. and therefore come ye unto our palace. and we shall* do visit
your wounde^ by our Surgyens. which shall ordeyne right well and diligently for
your health

Then^e was the noble jaso^ brought unto the palace with great loui^g and
preisinges of the ladies and damoiselles of the knights and of the people of
the cite of Olyferne. The wedowes be wailed greatly because he was not erst
comen for the loss of her hus^ondes they that were ma^ed reioysed and were
glad of his coniyng. They that were disco^forted and desolate recoured their
courage all new For in the vaillau^ce and in the high virtues of jaso^ rested
all their hope. In his strength they took affian^ce. jn his wit they trusted.
In his vaylliau^ce they we^e reconforted / And in his good fortune consolate /
Eertes hit seemed to they then^e. that they were delivered from the pains of
hell / and brought into paradys What shall j more say the fair Mirro thoughre
and dremed often times of jaso^ / as of the knight that she lonyd most of the
world. The preu Jason was three days long in the palace without any arms
beryng / And during these three days the fair Mirro went often times unto him.
hoping that Jason should have required her of love / whithe he had gladly
doon^: but as cremetous and doubting the recountres of reffuse. durstei no
manner touch that materene make any semblaunt to her ne to none other

On the fourte day than when the nobles of Oliferne kne we that jaso^ was hole
of his hurtes / and might well bear arms / they assembled and came unto the
Queen Mirro and said to her: Madame ye have well cause for to reioye your self /
if a heart ifortunat after grief upon grief may resourdre when fortune will
favor and aid. We and your cou^ceylle have often times behold and ^ee^ the
right high prowess and discrete conduyte of your knight Jason. Certes hit may
well be said / that his like was never founden. hit semetsyto us. that fortune
has brought him unto your hands: for to resuscyte and Reyse you. for to take
vengaunce of the over great euyllis and meschyeues that has been doo^ to you
and your men during this war. And for many raysons we counceylle you. that ye
ordeyne and consiytute the said noble Jason captain of this Royaume and
chief of your war For we think so much noblesse and virtue in him: that he
shall never have rest in his courage unto the time / that he have chassed
away your mortell enemies out of yonr Royaume / and brought them to
disconsiture

^It^s to wete / whether the noble queen Myrro was right joyous in her heart:
when she herd so hygly reco^mended him that she mo^^e louid above all the men
of the world hit is no meruaille thawh she so were and debonayrly she accorded
the request that the nobles and her conceyll had made to her. And forthwyth
she sent for jason. and in the presece of the^ that had made the request as
before is said. she constitued hi^ Captain geuerall of all her royaume. Then^e
jason remercyed and thanked the noble Queen Myrro of the honor that she had
done to hi^* and also the nobles and her cou^ceyll for their good pourchare
Inexcusing greatly him self of nonhabilite Sayng that he was not propice ne
worthy of so hye charge and honor to enterprise: But all they that there were
p^sent said / That notwithstanding his excusacions. they would have none other
capy^^yne but him / and that he should be it: as far as he would not disobeye
the noble queen Mirro They shewid him so many demo^strau^ces that he
enterprised and took upon him the charge / and that same our the noble queen
Myrro deliuerid unto the noble damoiseau Jason all that was necessary to hi.
and ordained his estate: And wha^ the noble preu Jason felt hi^ in this honor
so high set in his astate / he sent forth with to the king of esclauonye.
commanding him to depart he and all his ooste from the^s. And that anon he
should void the royame of oliferne: or ellis on the moru^ betymes he should
dispose him and make him ready to be receyuid by bataille Wha^ the puissau^t
king of Esclauonye understood that jason had so send him his ma^deme^t. he
had right great meruaille. hou well he answerde to the heraulde that he hadd not
ente^cion for to dissoge him ne to reyse his siege / and that he would erst
have at his conma^deme^t the noble que ne mirro / for to do with her his will
le / and sent word again unto the noble preujaso^. that also dear as he had
his life he should keep hi^ that he came not in his presence. and if he came in
his hands: he should do him deye a miserable death

Inco^tine^t as the noble preu jason had vndersta^de^ this a^swere. he did to
publisshe in all the quarefours of the cite / That all they that were of age to
bear arms should be ready on the morn^ erly for to goo with h: for to envahye
and fight with their enemies / and thus passyd that ^dy ^^to the night / That
jason then^e began to the^ke on the great honor and charge that he had
receiuid. and then^e wha^ he was withdrawe^ in to his chamber continuyng his
amourouse p^sees and thoughtis He began to say by him self in this manner Ha a
mydere ladi hou have ye do^ to me this great worship and given to me more good
then^e appteyneth to mine astate. and hou shall hit be possible to no^bre the
excess of bou^te / of clerenes of beauty with all other ^tues that be^l you I
ought not to meruaille if your right excellent beauty draws to iour love the
corages of strange prices / for ye be adressid in all bountees. the most fair
creature and the most discrete that god and Nature ever fourmed The right most
perfayt that is ough where. hou should it be then^e but if ye were beloved of
all folk: Certes ye are worthy that the air be replenisshid with callinges
and of voyses cryeng after you and requyreng your grace and mercy / Ha aye
that be so much excellent and virtuous. That all my thoughts and
ymaginacio^s ben turned. and given to you that are of so much hye valor: Not
wistanding j shall not absteyne me to love your noble person. For j shall
the better prospere and be of the more value In such or semblable words the
preu jaso^ passid the most perte of the night. and unto morn erly. the day
apperid fair and clear And ano^^ ^^ter in short time after the death of (...)
corfus. Jason and the syrien ^^doubed them / and assemblid them of the cite to
fore the palace of the queen Mirro and than wha^ jason saw and knew that his
people were set i^ ordena^ce he went unto the fair mirro and said to her ^
this manner / Madame pray ye for your knight / the which above all thing
desires: that he migght do that thing. that might be to you right agreeable:
and profitable to you and your cite. Certes right excellent and vaillan^t
knight answer the queen myrro / ye ar much preysed and hygly recom^ended of
my men^ / And for so much j pray you that in this iourneye ye have good
courage for to defend mi quarele which is good and just / And as to the
regard of my self / I put mine Armee and my men under the co^duy / te of your
preudho^mye and your wy^^o^ / Prayng unto the gods that they will make your
fortune to shine clear. and tenhau^se my godde quarele

How by the hye vailliau^ce of jason the king of sklauonye and his ooste were
disco^fited and him self stain to fore Oliferne:


Thus as the nobie queen spack and admonestid the worthy knight jason and his
me^ to do well and fight vayliantly in defending her just and good quarele /
jason began to behold her so arda^tli that she was ashamed hou well that she as
wise and discrete held honest manner. and than the noble jason after theleue
and congye taken as well of her as of the ladies and damoyselles departed from
the palace with great bewailinges / and mounted on his horse: But there were
many of the ladies and damoiselles of the court / that began to bewepe him /
prayng unto the gods to give h^ good adventure / And they said on^ unto an
other that it should be great dominage if tohi^^ came one fortune other then^e
good / and that they had never seen none so courtoys ne so gracyous / and that
he was the very sourdre and well of noblesse. Anon then^e as the noble preu
jason was on horse bak he set his me^ in right fair ordonan^ce / and after
set hem on the way toward the field And the people by all the way that he
passed knelid down to fore him and prouoqued the gods unto his aid and
help. And then^e wha^ he was come^ ito the field he assembled all his folk
and put hem in fayt ordona^ce of battle And then^e wha^^ he had required
the^ insta^tly and amonested the^ to do well. he did do march the^ against
their enemies which abode them a foot rengid and right well ordained. At the
meuyng Jason did do so wne trompettis. tabours. and cornessatasins / buysines
and other instruments so melodious^y that hit seemed that they had goon^ unto
a wedding or marriage or som^me great feste: And thus tryumphing of one hye
will medlyd with Joy desiring to do well: Rejoicing them self singulerly in
the vayllian^ce and good conduyte of the right worthy and noble knight Jason
they approached in such wise their mortell enemies that they began to couche
their good speris and begin the stonr And in that same time as the king of
sclauonye held his me^ in array a meruayllous great Raven came fleyng over his
head cryeng right horribly INcontinent as the king of Escla uonye herd such a
cry he began to tremble for Ire and be in a great agonye / and looked after the
raven and said O over hard and trembling hope. This makes me to enter i^ to
frenesye For this foul is messager of the death / or of right evil adventure /
and this is an evil sign / for I feel my veins all void of blood / Ha a
midere lady what shall I nou do Certes j shall never put me to reproach for to
flee / I had lever deye and let here my life / than ever should be rehearsed to
you of me any dishones te tidings / Certes all they that were tho about him
were fore abasshid. and not without cause But nevertheless they reconfor^ed
the^ self the best wise they might. and anon was made tha^ on both
^^desameruayllous cry with which they marched that one against that other And
began by the archers and arblasters the battle so aspre that the Air was
derked and obscurid with the quarrels and arowes and stones that fle we so thikk
/ and made with their Cries a great bruyt right meruayllons.

THe vayllyaunt knight Jason was in the formest fro^te of his people holding
his bo we in his hand where with he let flee Arowes upon his enemies largeli /
But at last the shot lassed And when Iaso saw that* he s^e^te upon his
horse and took his ^held and his spear Inescryeng Oliferne by th^e times. and
smote his hor^ with his sporis and thrested ^to the mid des of his enemies so
swiftly / that prusus ne the syriens could not follow him at the beginning
Then^e when hit came to breking of speris / The king of toscane and the king of
bongye knew him anon^: wherefore they ran^ against him / sayng that they would
avenge the death of the si^o^g geant corfus And both vaylliau^^y him tronchonyg
their speris upon his shield / without endomagyng his shield / but hit is well
to believe that the noble pren jason failled not at this first course: for he
smote the king of bongye by such radeur that he left him out of his arson^s
/ and bare him there unto the earth: And so passid forth. and then^e came
against him the king of Poulane / but that was to his evil health / For jasons
spear trauersid his shield his hauberk and the body all to breking his spear /
And then^e came on unto the bataylle Prusus accompanied of his knights That
meruaillously mayntened them self in ensewing the faytes of jason / and thus
began one and other to show them self with right great effusion of blood on
both parties: But much more of the^ of Esclauonye / then^e of the^ of
Oliferne.

Incontinent that the noble Jason had broken his spear / he gryped in his hand
his good swerd that was clear and trenchaunt / And pretending that me^ should
speak of his faites and vailliaunces. he adressid hi^ on that part where he
saw the banyer royal of Esclauonye. And supposed to have entrid there upon
his enemies* but they held hem thikke to geder. and cast and smote upon Jason
right asprely. And jason upon them by such virtue that he offoundred plente of
their heedes. detrenched their sheldes and slew great no^bre of good knights
/ For the vaylliau^t Prusus and his knights aborded than there in suyng Jason
at every struck bathed his swerd in the blood of his enemies And did so great
fete of arms on all sides / that they that beheld hi^: and his mayntene.
callid him death and said / Certes the death assaylleth us having the form
conhabyleme^t of a knight. Flee that wole his fureur and his trenchaunt swerd /
for whom he arecheth shall never after see fair day.

Jason thus in this while did Arms at his will / For he being on horse made
the sclauo^ knights march a foot and many other with out nombre / one and
other said that his body was all of stele / And that he was noman mortal /
but that he was a thing of that other world: For hit seemed to his adversaries
that they had no spear no sword that might enter in to his body. What shall
I say unto you: he did so well that by vyue force with his trenchau^t sword
he brake the wards and array of the Esclauons and came unto the banere of the
king esclauon where he was acompanyed with xxx. knights that rengid the^ for
the guard of the baner But incontinent when they saw the swerd of jason ready
for to smite on them. The most asseured of them began to tremble.
Nevertheless they set hem in array and took their sheldes haunced their
swerdes / and entryd freely and fast a foot / the preu jason swym^yng in a new
courage by great plai^ir and appetite for to get good loos and good renom^ee
smote in among tho knights that withstode him with all their puissaunce. And
then^e in this manner began again the bataille and a meruaillous stour: in so
much that on all sides men might see knights flee each other / sheldes to
break and fle ^ pieces / hauber^s dismailled* he^mes broken / and blood spryng
out of their wounds. and fall upon the earth

Certes the noble preu jason had there much to do and su^fre as well for to
keep his men in array / as for to e^^aye and assaylle his enemies For his
shield was smy^e^ in many pieces: his armures were adommaged i^ many places /
This notwithstanding he e^^ertued him self defending / would never cess^. til
he came unto the banere of the king of Esclauonye / and to the knight that bare
the banere he gaf a struck so dismesurabli that he clefte his head unto the
chyn^. And fill doun^ deed fro his horse to the ground: and the baner also in
the presence of the king of esclauonye: The which anon as he perceived that
stroke / withdrewe him a part. and one of the knights went for to auan^ce
and releue the banere / but the noble preu Jason made of him as he did of that
other And after that he brac and all to ^e^te the banere in pieces at the horse
feet. This done he began to smite on the right side and on the lift side. And
then^e the Esclanon^ lost courage and vaillian^ce / And on the contrary they
of olyferne seeing the good conduyte of their captain / began to grow
better and better in such valoir that as many ennemies as they met / they
slew with their swerdes. And so in the end hit happe^d that as the noble
Jason ran here ^d the^e* he recontred the king and slew hi^ with one struck
that he gaf him with his swerd / Than the esci^^o^s all disco^forted and
despaired as they that has no more esperance ne hope to obtain the victory
escryed sayng. Late us flee and save our self for all is lost. for the king
is deed: With which cry they turned their back. and put hem to flight ^d
dysaroye / how well that they were yet more than. v. ^. And than the vaylliaunt
Capiteyn jason and all his bataylle poursewed them cha / cyng and s^eing them
out of the royaume of olyferne / This don the noble Jason and his company
returned unto the place where the esclauo^s had hold their siege / and there
they found richesses plente. and tha^ when they had de^ted their gayn and bu^^
as hit appteyneth unto such a caa^ to every man his part after his co^dycion /
The ryg^t vayllian^t jason commanded to trusse the tents and pauilon^s of his
enemies. And than he and his company returned in to the cite as ^ayn^ueurs
with much great glory and triumph.

The fair Myrro came than to mete with Jason garnisshed with a gracious
maintene. And made to him the grettest hononr and reverence: that was to her
possible / leding him unto her palace / where he entrid with great pain. for
the people was asse^blid there on all parts about hi^ in a meruaillous no^bre
for to see hi^ And cried all with an hyhe voys sayng. Now is returned again
victorious our defe^dour: our swerd. our health and all our esperaunce: which
has only in him self more of vaisselage than is in all Esclauonye / and ought
to be honored and recomanded above all other. Certes the noble jaso^ was
fested this night and reco^ma^ded of such and semblable loenges of the^ of
Oliferne / which made in the streets daunses and esbatemens thanking their
gods And always Jason was more and more in the grace of the ladies / For the
best born^ the most fair the best accomplisshed and the most especy all fyred
their love in hi^ / All were jalouse of hi^: But jason never thought on none
of them / but only / upon the seulle and oultrepassed beauty of the virtuous
Mirro: which always was in his memory / And all they had wondre and
marvel of the beauty / graeiousete. wit and perfection of jaso^. And for to
abregge this story the vailliau^t and oultrepreu Jason was in this glory and
triu^phe unto midnight which tha^ withdrewe him: And when he was withdrawn in
his chamber he reentred in to his reuerye of love as he hadd be^ to fore
acustomed. And set all in oublie and forgeting the poysan^t and dangerous
strokes that he had that day receyuid in the bataylle against the Esklauo^s.
whereof his body was right sore. and concluded in him self that on the morn^ he
would declare his courage unto the lady. But wha^ the day was come and when he
came to fore her. he felt hi^ self so sore surpsed with love that he wiste not
what to say. And thus he drof forth long and many a day that he for ^^le his
hardines of arms. his ^w^^e speech ne his strength could not auaylle in
gyuing him hardiesse / for to discouere his courage unto his lady Wherefore on a
night in his bed began to blame him self / and said softely to him self in
this manner

THat may prouffyten the continuell be way linges that I make for my lady. I am
not a ferde when I find me in a troublous bataille of an ho^derd thousand
men^. but wha^ j suppose to speak to my lady / j tremble for feere and dread
and wot not what to say / for to fore her I am as al tauiss^^^d. in like wise
as a pour and sha^mefast man that suffers to dye for honger rather then^e for
shame he dar beg his breed O what vergoigne proceeds of such shamesasines.
I speak to my self allone and I answer / Often times I am advised that to morn^
I shall do meruayles and so j conclude right well / but wha^ it comes for to be
done j have no memory ne remembrau^of all my conclusio^s: Am j not then^e well
simple: when unto te most fair the most sage. the most discrete: and the most
virtuous of all other / I have no hardynesse for to say my desire and will^.
how well my heart iugeth that I am sowhat in her grace / but now comes upon me
an other judgment. and me seems that she will never accord to my requests O
right noble and nonparaille Mirro / she is without peer / as the rose among
thor nes: Alas and what shall j do without you. j have made a p^sente to you of
my heart and my will. if I understood that ye were born^ in a constellacion
cupesshing you of thinfluence of love and that love had no power tesproue upon
you his vtues j would not enploye my time for to the^ke on you but wha^ me
seems that so great ha bondan^ce of the^cesse of beauty naturel as youris is.
it may not be but that it is entremedlid of love of pite / and of merci. it
must needs be that your humble friend be rauisshed in the co^templaco^n of your
glorionse value: desiring your good grace wisshing your alian^ce / and
requiring the gods and fortune that of you and me they make oon how and one
bed where we might e^brase the sovereign play sirs of this world and pla^ly
find amerouse felicite.

THe preu jaso^ with thise words fill a ssepe: and after he awoke so alumyned
with the fire of love that hit was to him ipossible to take his rest but to
turn and walowe and travail in his bed. And there as love thus assailed
him again / he determined utterly that he would adventure hi to speak to his
ladi: what that ever happen thereof / And so he did / for the same day he came
unto her and said in this wise / Madame j have seruid you as well as to me is
possible for two causes Principally that one for tha^quite of cheualerie. and
that other not for to disserue the rychesses that ye have under the power of
fortune But allonly that singular thing that nature has made you lady of and
upon which fortune has puyssaunce. Madame ye have don to me plente of
curtoysies / And offered great yefies of monoye Whereof I thank you: how well I
hold the^ but of litil exti^e. for couetise of avarice have not alumed me of
their fire. j demand not the great tresours that be^ i^ the abismes of the sea* ner the^ that be^ enclosed i^ the mo^taignes: my desir testith i^ ij.
singular things: that one is for to conquer name in arms: which ought to be
thappetite of the vocacion of all noble hertes That other is to obey un to the
com^au^dements and plaisau^ces of love that binds. and obliges me to be
youris: for to thenke on you. to attend and abide your beniuolence to do
thing that may playse your eyes and your heart

Alas my dear lady all good and honor comes of you: and if ye be all my
deport and fortune. And the gods have suffrid me* to have do thing digne of
amerouse meri^e in your favor / put not ye your heart in discognysau^ce. by
the which your noble royaume is put i^ pees Receive hier to your man true
friend and louar your knight / and the right humble and obeissaunt heart. of
whom the body secheth with all your playsirs to obey him that has made al his
tresour of iour beauty. from the our that the good fortu^e brought me hither
unto your presence. I was and have been in all points ready to live and dye for
you in your service. in which j took arestan^ce / j submysed prestly my neck
to bear the fardell of iour war re / ye know how I have born^ it. ha a my dear
lady have mercy on me. I supplye yon humbly for asmoche as never true louar
required his lady with more desire and affecto^n in all honor and curtoisie.

The preu jason cessed then^e his request in beholding the fair myrro right
amorously / the which herd hi with a glad will. but this not wista^ding she
made no manner semblaunt. but for asmoche as to prove jf jason was asmoche
affected in love as in arms / she a^swerde to hi as her follows sayng /
Certes fair sire jason j know that ye be he that have discharged my royaume of
them that ete and destroyed the substan^ce and which would by force have
ocupied and wasted hit / And so j will not say but that he be right digne of
great merit. and that your thank and reward ought to be yolden unto you: But
unto the regard for to require me of love / me semet^ye have much to far
enterprised / ye know well ye ar none other but a knight / what might say the
kings and hye princes of who^ I have late made refuse. jf I g^fe me to you.
how well mine ente cionis not in no wise to blame you But unto the^de that ye
lose not iour time. I auise you to seche oughwer ellis your party. and than do
ye wisely and require you to be content her with for j know no better remedy
for your appaiseme^t Alas my dear ladi a^suerde jaso^. Remember you that my
heart is such that ca^ chiese by no way none other ladi in love but you Certes
that shall not be unto the time that the fysshes flee in the air: And that the
birds swym^e in the water / My friend said the lady unto the regard for
tende^de to take a thing difficile. is no great prudence ye be meure i^ your
young age a^touching Arms / But beware that ye put you not in so parsounde an
error that ye can not easily come out / Certes I love you more than ye wene.
I am ready for to yield you yowr merit for the great goodness that ye have don
to the cite of olifer ne / I pray you that ye require me no more from hens
forth. and late this suffice you / Ha a madame a^swerde jason than. how may j
have suffisaunce when I may not find grace to fore yowr noble vysage Of which
right indigent and not satisfied I remain. ye daygne not to condescende to my
prayers. hit is now your play sir that I fall in despair. ^nt syn hit goth so
and that ye will have no compassion of a true knight that has be^ youris /
and the deffendour and the hand that has obtained the peace for your royaume.
and the propre arm that has taken vengeance of your ancient forfaiteurs and
enemies. al dispaired j depart prayng unto the gods that will eulu^^ne you.
with pite and merci as they know that is nedeful for you and unto all our
gods I command you.

How that jason after that he had required the queen mirro of love departed
all disco^forted from oliferne: and hou she went after him


WIth this conclusion the preu Jason all in a trance and half rebuqued went
unto the ladies and damoiselles. And the fair mirro and on woman which was
secret with her depted fro thens / but the queen entrid allone into her
chamber / thi^king much on jason. which at that time comen among the ladies
as said is with an heart sorouful and enuyro^ned with displaisir. thanked the^
greatly of the great curtoisie that he had fonden in the^ / and in this point
took leave recom^anding him self in their good grace. After deperted th^^ unto
his stable and commanded to (...) le his horse. and after that he sent see his
arms and adoubed him / and forthwith without any more speech hou well it was
nigh night: he rode sorth out of the cite: and was so a^gry and desplaisau^t
that he wist never whither to become / and when the ladies saw that jason
deperted from the cite so allone and disco^forted thinking on the vtues where
in he was e^dowed they co^playned him much: and said one to an other that he
had not his heart in ease. Many of them bewailed him i^ such wise that the
great teres fi^^ down from their eyes / and among the^ there was one that kneu
so^what of the secrets of the queen. and she having seen Jason taking his horse
all armed and depart out fro the cite ca^ unto myrto all bewept as she was
and said to her in this manner

Madame what eyleth your knight or sudden chance may come to him to depart
out of your cite armed and allone at this our hane ye sent h^i^to any place
hit seems thathe has his heart oppressid with aspre dueil and sorrow: Certes
bele answerde the Queen / I wot not what hi eyleth. but j trow right well that
he is not all at his ayse: for in reco^pe^sing of the good services that he
has do^ to me in this war. he has desired and required me of love. and for
asmoche as j have not accorded to him his request. he is departed from me all
angry / and more know not I. Madame than said the damoiselle. gaf ye to him
no manner hope ne esperan^ce at his departing / Certes j gaf to hi none said
the lady. And how said the damoiselle / ye have said to me more than a. M.
times to fore this time / that he was the only desir of yowr heart? j confess
that to you said t^^ queen. for yet mi love is set on him merueyllonsly. and
bear alwey in my souenan^ce his great beauty and his we le doings / Ha / a
madame a^swerde tha^ the damoiselle / why have ye tha^ a^suerd hi so coldeli
and refusingly: certes said the lady / j wot never why But that j was so
abasshid and so chauffed in my blood / wha^ j vndstode that he required me of
love that I wist not to a^swere. and also ^i mine advise mine honor requires
that at this first request. I should hold me strange and not tabo^don^e my
self. For they that at the first re^^ste of their lovers agree to them* ought
to be ashame^^* For as much as the more part of men have no verite ne
loyaulte as to the Regard of love And also there be many that ca^ non^ other
wise do / but serve ladies and gentle women with lies and deceytes My mother
told me and bad me keep this lesson when she sent me first to scole. if i^
have well retained her doctrine me thinks I have not done much amys. for the
thing that is gote^ hy great travail and long requests is much more worth
and better kept then^e that is gotten lightly: Certes that lady that of her love
is required can do no better / then^e to hold her strange and be much
required

^ Adame^ answerde the damoiselle* I accord much to that ye say to me* but
there is in all thing manner hou well that there be many me^ that pray and
require ladies of their love asmoche as they may mak^g lesinges and false
oaths that can not be cou^te^ but certes madame this noble and vayllia^t knight
jason is not in mine adnys no thing like as to the compte of other. and after
that j understood by your words ye have sent him from you all hou^tose and
shamed in so much as j deem that he is goone in such wise as he came hither.
For at his departing he came and took leave of the ladies / Wherefore I am in
doubt that ye shall never see him more. And is he goon as ye say said then^e
the lady / ye certes said the damoisell / he is certaili ghost / By what place
and by which gate / That wot I not said the damoiselle / but j trow better
that he is returned into his country / then^e to any other place

WHa^ the noble queen Myrro understood this that said is. and that she had a
little remembrid her self of the departing of her dear love and friend: she
fill doun^ to the earth as all through smyten and tronchoned with amerouse
sorrow and dueil / she began then^e to wrynge her hands and to smite with her
feet sayng not passing loud. Alas. alas Fortune is to me hard. Alas and what
have j done my self evil auised when I was required of love of the most
renomed knight of all the world: of the most vaillaunt in arms / of the
fairest that lives And that I have not humelyed my self with his great
humylite / ^ have made refuse of my right great well and of my grettest ewre
and hap. Certes I could not keep i^ mine house the good fortu^e that the goddys
of their secre te tresour of their g^ce had se^te to me and brought and planted
in my hands. By my litil advise and ente^deme^t I have chaced out of olyferne
hi that has rescowed and brought hit again fro mortal encombrau^ce by the hye
valyau^ce of his person and the travail of his body with the p^cious prys of
his blood. and then^e what have j do / Haa my heart what have thou consented My
mouth what haste thou voided My tongue what have thou pro^erred And mine
ente^dement where were thou: Where was thy force or thy puissau^ce. or thy
will* that desiring the love and thalyan^ce of hi that was aba^do^ned to the
which had thy mouth closed for shame. and have suffered the corporal and
bodily mouth to deny that thing* that thou approuedest to seche above all
otherthing O right pour shamefastnes / ye hou^touse shamefastnes / i^ what
ploye or in what p^sse am j now by thy cause / Certes j am ashamed that j have
refused thalyan^ce of my friend and of my domicille But certes j shall amend
hit to my power / j shall goo after him so far til j shall find him And I
shall have no shame to put me ^ his mercy

Wha^ the yo^g damoisell aperceyued the great displaisir where i^ her
maistresse was / she shitte the chamber door to the^de that no person should
come upon the^: and bego^ne there to weep til night: and that a lady ca^: and
said the souppe was all ready Tha^ the queen did do a^swere her by the
damoyselle / that she would not souppe for so much as she felt her not well
disposed and also comanded that no per^one should come to her that night /
Which a^swere so made the queen and the damoiselle began to make new
bewailinges and teeris and after began to be wail jason / and among all other
things / The queen said these words / yet may there worse aueuture grieve me
more for after a^ over much dangerouse inconvenience she sendth to me the death
/ Ha a late me sorrow. but what shall I mow do I wot never what to thenke.
and what ought I to do by your faith: seem ye good that I ought to goo after
him. or that I send any faithful man fter him of my knowleche Certes I think
if I should send a messager after him that he would not come again / And if j
went my self after hi. that should be to me the grettest dishonor of the
word. madame answerde than the damoiselle. ye ought to know your caas / and
of two ways to take the best: If ye have inte^cion that Jason be your
husbonde / hit behooves no longer to soiourne. for ye must goo or send unto
him with all diligence / and for to say to yon mine opinion: if hit were so
happend to me as it is to you: j would send none other messager / but my
self. And know ye verily that ye may have no dishonor for to goo after him
vnderstonden and well considerid the good and agreeable services that he has
do^ to you / and to your royaume For under the color for to guerredone and
reward him / ye may take occasion to come into words and to give him so^
matere yet for to serve you. Certes fair donghter said the queen. j wot not
what to think / what me is best to do. for if j goo after him and find him /
what shall j say My dear ^de the damoiselle: as j have right now said ye shall
present to him the guerredo^ of the great honor and good service that he has
do^ to yon in iour necessite. this thi^keth to me lityl substance for to enter
into speech of my principal cause said the guene / Certes madame a^swerd
theu^e the damoiselle. when ye shall come and be to fore the knight / love
shall teache you to speak / if ye will record the lessons and epistles of love
by the space of te^ year. it shall but lityl prouffite to your aua^cement / for
there lacks nothing but thinspiracion of love medlid with hardynesse and of
humayne ente^deme^t: speki^g with the mo^th which is instrument of the
dischargyng and discovering of hertes: Syn that it is so said the the fair
Myrro queen of oliferne. All thing considerid j had much lever to couere a
lityll blame / then^e that I should in all points with out ever to recouere
again all the hole desire and plaisir of iniherte and the co^solacion of myn^
eye^. then^e j shall say to you mine advise. that hit is need and necessite so
to do. and that ye must now goo unto my women^ and say to the^ / that to
morn^ betymes j shall goo in pilgremage accompayned of you only / and that
they take heed and see well to all things. And ye and I to fore the son
rising shall enterprise in the most secret wise that shall be possible our
e^queste upon the most noble and vaillian^t knight / the most fair / and the
most adressed that his living / That is jason mine only friend and we shall do
so much that he shall be founde^. This advise seemed right good unto the
damoiselle / the which with all diligence obeyed to the comau^dement of her
maistresse: and after these things about midnight. they made ready her things
and on the more erly to fore day. both they took each a good palfroye in
habit unknown and rode forth on their way: and such was their aue^ture that
they came for to bayte in the logging where her friend Jason had logged that
night / And tha^ she began to demand of the host of thaffayre dnd contenan^ce
of the knight and what chere he had made the even to fore. and at his departing
what way he had taken and hold. And the hooste answerde to the lady: that as
to the regard of his chere and thaffaire of the knight: he had nether ete^ ne
dronke^ in all the evening / And a^ (...) the way that he had holden / he*
enseigned to the ladi / which was than much pensif for Jason. that had not
that eueni^g taken no refection of mete ne of drink

How jason fougt with the king dyomedes in the sheep


THe noble qu^mirro and her dam^yed than not long (...) batyng: for they took
their horses and rood as hastily as to hem was possible. and so roode iij.
days long after jason. hering in every logyse where they descended ^idinges of
hi: but they could not overtaken ne find him. And on the fourth day suyng they
came unto a part of the sea* where was shewid unto them a ship / where in were
marcha^ts of athenes / and was told to them that Jason was therein and that he
would go to athenes and furthermore if they would goo there was yet a ship of
other merchants that was on the point to depart: but then^e the fair mirro was
in such a point of displaisir wha^ she knew that jaso^ was departed that she
made great sorrow. This notwithstanding she was anon^ conseylled what she would
do. and concluded syn that she had somoche traueyled that she would prove
dame fortune and went after jason. with this conclusion all full of aspre
sighi^ges she went to the ship that should disancre for to go to Athenes and
aggreed with the maro^ner which was brought theder by force of tempest and
wind and anon^ they disancred and deperted: and when they saw that it was
calm and flewe no^t. they made ready their oores and rowed by the force of
their atmes: for at that time me^ vsid not so many sailles as they do now
notwithstanding they exployted in such manner that they ca^ into the hye see /
where they rowed long time / in which time the queen Mirro beca^ seek unto the
death. and fynably when they had bencertaine space of time a interuaillous orage
and great wind cast hem here and there. in such wise that fortune brought
he^ to the port of trace: inagre all the maronners for they were al nduertysed
that it was perilous to ariue there because of the king of that country wiche
was named dyomedes

The king dyomedes theu^e was a tyrau^t right inhumayne / and had of long time
be^ acoustu^nted to rob all them that arrived in his royaume were hit by see
or by land he was at that time soiourinng in his cite named Bysance. The
which was after ward called consta^tinoble and incontine^t that this ship was
arrived at the port of Bysarice. Dioinedes did hastily do arine hun. and
brought with him xxx. of his tyrants and in this inanee ca^ unto the port
where were arrived the two ships of athenes. and as soon as he might be herd of
the maro^ners he escryed the^ and said. vylayns meschants and unhappy come up
on hye and come out of my ships* for ye must logge in my pris^s / or ye shall
have as many strok^es as ye may suffer

When the (...) (...) jason had understand the great felo^nye of the tiraunt /
and that he saw that all the maro^ners tre^blid for dread i^ such wise. that
they dursie not soune a word. he enhaunced his heed and answerde to dyomedes
sayng Gloton miserable what demandest thou: be we not infortunat ynowh / as
thou semesilate us in peace. Dyomedes hering this answer was as a^gry as he
might be: wherefore he conma^ded his conplices that incontme^t they should
aue^ge him of the injury that jason has said to him in his presence. than
the accomplices which were right aspre and more ready to do evil than otherwise /
escryed Jason to the death and descended from thens that they were til they came
to his ship upon the sand: and when the preu jason s^^^e the manner of these
tyrauts: he recomforted him self the best wise he might and his maronners
which were so dysconforted that they had no power to put hem to deffence / he
took his shield and held fast his good sword / and bad them to take their
vasto^s and arniures: and that they should deffende hem vaylliauntly and of
good courage / But in this sayng the gloto^s approached Jason and sinote upon
him with their swerdes right fierssy: Certes they enuayhed him on all sides by
grette felonye / But they could not well areche hi^ for as much as there was
between he^ about a. vij. foot of watre / wherefore sont of the went for to
fecche a brigge of tree right strong and propice: and wherein were nails of
yron^ / on both sides: and they did somoche as they fastened this brighe unto
the ship of Jason: And thene they that were well asseurid three of the most
vayllian^t of them mounted there upon and might goo thero^ a fro^te: But w^a^
they supposed to have smyten upon the noble preu jaso. As vailliau^t and right
asseured knight as he was / he enuertued him self upon the^ by such co^duyte
that with three strokes of his good sword that he gaf to them he made all three
to tumble into the sea / where they dra^ke so much that they never arose but
left there their life

When the maro^ners of the ship saw that their lord jason defended him so
vayliau^tly withh^ the tre^ching of his good swerd they took courage / for they
seasid their siaues / and arniures. And enterprysed the bataylle against their
enemies for to supporte and help alytyl jason / how well they held he^ gladli
by hynde as they that fled the strokes to their power. Certes the noble Iaso^
kept right vaylliau^tly the passage of the brigge against the tyra^ts and
furnisshed hem well upon thentre of the pla^ke upon which they went up one after
an other of whom many were hurt and s^ayn / There was the tyrant Dyomedes the
which entremedlid him to his power. to co^duyte his co^plices and there brayed
as alyon / for somoche as his men might not match ne beat dou^ the vayliau^ce
of the knighte jason: The which allone resisted their fiersie and puyssau^ce
Notwithstanding for all his great pride he ne dayned not to make any assault
but by the brigge / What shall i^ say you / certes the bataille dured right
long between jaso^ and the tracie^s. i^ so much that the queen mirzo herd
tydinges thereof: And was told to her that there was a knight in the ship of
their conpanye that made so many hye vaylliau^ces upon the tyra^tes of trace:
that there was never none seen like to him in prowess

wha^ the queue mirzo understood these tydinges she thought inco^tine^t that
hit was Jason that fought so vaylliau^tly for to deffe^de the two ships / she
had gladly auau^ced her self for to have see his great vasselage / but she was
so right feeble that in no wise she might lift up her heed and in like wise was
her damoyselle And so long dured the terrible bataylle the ylle party of the
Traciens and of Jason / that the tracie^s found no more a live but xij. of. xxx
that were come thedir And of these. xij. seeing the death of their felawes. there
was none so hardy that dursie present him to fore jason / ne cople with h^
Tha^ the king dyomedesseyng this that said is: was so a^gry that he might no
more be / Tha^ wening to do vayllyaunce and for to give courage to his
co^plices: he went up on the pla^ke and presented him self so far that jason
salued him / and welcom^eth him with such a stroke of his swerde^ upon the
highest of his helm / that he smote him doiireuersid upon the brygge and syn
lift up his arm with the sword / but the paillards tyra^ts as weary and
recreaunt fsed all trembling and were so abasshid wha^ they saw their kig
Dyoinedes so suddenly sineto^dou^. tha^ som^e of his accomplices drewehi by the
legs down from the brigge in so much that they took from hihys horn that was
about his neck / and blewe and souned hit loud for to make assemble there
the Cythe^eins of the cite / the which hering the soun of the horn^ assembled
the^ for to come to the rescousse of their lord / but the tempest of the sea
cessed than and the maronners casied the brigge in to the watre. And than when
they were disancred they departed with their ships out fro the port with at
diligence. And began right joyously to row tha^king their gods and the hye
vaylliauces of the noble knight jason that they were so escaped of the
dangerous paryllys of the felon tyrauni / The which on that other side had so
great despyte and sorrow: that he seemed better ama^ out of his wit than other
wise / for he had not fou^den to fore the knights that had so much prowess
and vailliaunce as he had founde^ to in Jason

THe two shippis tha^ departed from trace as said is: and were four days long
upon. the sea. And on the fyfthe day they arrived at Athenes / where jason went
ala^de. and so did the fair Mirro / the whice began to wax hole of her
maladye. At which desce^te a land Mirro espied where Jason took his loggi^g:
and she followed acompaynied of her damoiselle unto the time that she saw the
loggig / which was the hows of an notable burgeys: And tha^ was she in great
thoughts and variacions for to know. whether she would logge in the same
logging or not / Thus^ vatieng in this doubt she approached the loggyse / and
syn returned again and after came again / and fynably when she saw that jason
was not in the way she we^tein / and required of the bourgoys that for her
money she might have a chamber in that house. Then^e the bourgoys seeing that
the ladi was much well adres sid of gracious manner of speking and otherwise /
he logged her and her damoiselle to her plaisir: And did do put the two
palfrayes in a siable by Iasons horse / wiche anon began to nyhe as soon as he
sinellid them* for he knew them for asmoche as they had benlong to gyder in
olyferne / and so made they great chere each to other whereof the bourgeys had
great marvel But thought nothing but well and gaf hem heye and otes And
after came to serve jason And found that his chamber was full of merchants and
maronners that were comen with him on the sea / which presented him wine and
mete / and gaf him great yeftes of rich jewelles and other strange things /
In this ehambre was with jason a man of six score year honest of his person:
and always strong and habyle: the which seeing this presen tacion made to jason
came unto the host and demanded him: who was this yongknight to whom men dydeso
much honor. but the bourgeys and thauncient man axid one of the maronners of
this matere And the maronner said / that he was the best / the most
virtuous and the most vayllyaunt knight of the world: and that they gaf to hi^
these presents / for as much as by his hye prowess he had p^serued them
from the tyranny and danger of the king Dyomedes and of his accomplices. And so
much said the maronner of jaso / that they iugged him with his mayntene and
semblaunce to be a noble knight and vailliaunt. Among these devises the
merchants ^ maronners took their leave of the preu Iaso^ and offered the^ to his
com^andement / and after reiorned unto their howses: and anon after that they
were goon. the bourgeys did do couere the table: which was couerid of the
yeftes. and jason would that the knight should sit first be cause of his aage
and aunciente / for in that time men held the ancient and aaged men in much
great reverence and honor

But in this present time hit goth^ all otherwise. the young men presume to goo
and sit above old and au^cie^ men. and mock and skorne them that be^ come
to great aage sayng / that they be feeble of their me^bres of their entendement
and of nature. and there by many children. that don their sader to understand
that they be foolis / wylling to have in governance the pour old me^ / not
pour but rich. For hit is great richesse to ama^ when that honorably may
amasse and bring his days unto the degree of old aage / and yet ben there
children that don worse / for they desire and wisshe their faders and mods ded
/ and serve hem with things contrary to their health and life. the which is
gretest tresour that ama^ may have as to wordly goods. Ha a how many ben there
of them in these days I see al most non other: for the yo^g people may not here
the doctrine of the old me^: and wene that they ben so wise / that men need
not to show them any wysedom: and also they ben unkind and full of
ingratitude* in so much that if they knew any thing where with they might
dishonor them they would do it: and they resenible unto the sone of noe
which by derisio^ showed the secret members of his fader Alas what cursed and
blind young the was that ^or to come again unto our matter the noble jason set
him down at the table by the ancient knight* and after that the hooste and
hostess which often time exorted jaso^ to make good ^here. but jas^n might
neither ^tene drink. for certes he did nothing but think* and spack not one
word but if he were demanded or araison^ed. Afther souper when the table was
voyded Jason and thauncient knight were leyde in one chamber: where were two
beds: and wha^jaso was leyde he began to sighe in such wise and of so inward
sorrow of his heart / that it seemed that the so wle should depart from the body
/ wherefore the thau^^^ent knight that was loggyd in that other bed by: ^^ght
not sleep / ^ thought right well in him self that ^ason was not at his ease.
and when he had long herkened his sighs and herd that they encry^^d always
more and more. he might no lenge^ tarry but he must speak / and said in this
manner / Sir knight I have great marua^lle of you Wherefore said jason: for
asmoch said thauncient knight. that your sighe^ and bewailinge^iuge to me that
ye ar i^ the bed of death / how well by a^ that I see ^ comprise in you / hit
seems not by the sight o^ the eye that ye be seek for your color is fress^ a^
roose in may. is it not the^e great merua^^e for to here you sighe / yes
certain / ha ^ sit knight a^swerde theu^e jaso^. if ye judge the disposico^n o^
my body after the color of my face ye be gre^ly abused for j have a seknes and
maladye right secret which shall first s^ee me e^ my face be stained or
discolou^^d I am al certain; Sir said thau^cie^t knight / ye hold a great
ram^e of despair: it is consiraynt said jason

Certes sireknight a^swerd the old knight. If ye will live what some ever
sekenes ye hane or maladye / ^ut you in my h^ndes and cure / and j make me
strong for to hele and make you hole. I trow sir knight ansnerde jason that
hit is not in your cunnyng and power that to do / ner in all the sub^lte of
a^^e the men mortal Tha^ answered the a^cient knight: be ye seek of the maladye
of love / where of no man may remedy but your lady ^a asire knight ^suerde
Iaso^ tha* who has tol^ you / me thiketh that ye oppsse me so sore that I
must confess to you my caas: And so I declare to you / that j am somoche
smete^ with the pes^yle^ce of love / that j may not live ne endn^e ne ^te ne
drink ne res^e nightne day / In good faith answerde thauncient knight / ye dar
not be aferd of death syn that ye have non other infirmite. For the maladye that
proceeds of love is so graciouse / that ^it puttet^ noman to death. Certes the
sekenes is of great ensoigne and pain But hit is a malady whereof me^ recoure
Sir said tha^ jason. If j d^ye not of bodili death. j shall dye of spirituel
death for hit is in no wise possible that never in this world j shall have
plasir or solace / and than shall j not be deed. Alas I must needs / ye treuly
of the most anguyss^yst death that any man may e^dure. Sire a^swerde tha^cient
knight / ye tell me right great meruailes. j tell you ^routh says jason: ^or j
am so infortunat in love and so much unhappy and have in my self so l^^yl of
valeu^. that j am ashamed and hountouse to live. And would that j were there.
where j shall be. v. honderd year here after with out any respyte

When thau^cient knight vn^stode that jason was in so much and bitter despair:
he had pite of him / and said to him for a lityl to comfort him Certes gentil
knight j know well my self and understood of this marcha^dise that of your
love ye have not e^yoyed your first desire and will / but j would fayn know if
any man^ has do^ you wrong of your lady. or ellis if this malady comes and
proceeds by the rigor of her. Certes ge^tyl knight answerde jas^. all my
meschief proceeds of the great rigor of my ladi and by the ^alour and
simplenes of me. for j have sernid that fair lady in a much dangerous war
that her mortal enemies m^de to her not long syn ^ the most dilig^t wise that
j could or might / and after wha^she was at her above of her aduersaire^. j
have required her of her grace that she would be my lady in love / but she has
not wylled to see in me so much virtue ne somoche valor that she would
accord her to my request. and thus I have therefore my life in great hate and
see none other remedy that / but j fall in despair

Fair sire ansuerde thau^cie^t knight have not ye often times herd say* that
one lost and two recouerid / if hit be so that a woman has made of you refuse
/ by your faith shall ye therefore be such a fooll as for to fall in despayr.
Co^sidere ye not that there be ynowh of other: and if ye have not ynowh of one.
j shall make you to have a dosayne: there is no great derthe ne scarcete of
women^ / Certes ^f ye remember you well. ye shall say tha^ they cracce out
men^es eyes: and therefore all this well ^siderid if your lady set litil by you
/ do the same to her and seche another without long taryyng. Certes sir knight
said jason / wha^ I have well marked and take heed of your words. ye speak
after your plaisir / These ben things that may better be said than exployted.
Certayu said the ancient knight j tell to you the secret and the verray
history: I w^l well that every man be amerous a^dloue / but that he have two
strenges on his ^owe And that noman put him so fersorth in lo ue / but that he
may withdraw hi in time and in season^. women one and other proprely to speak
^en malycious in her works. and this proceeds that each of them adresse other
of s^che councey^^ exhort and of favor. Men say: that the most orguilloust
and proudest creature that is. is the devil / and next after him (...) the
woman / and next after is the fool that is ouer^uydaunt. for pride comes not
but of* folly and somoche wenyng. Sum women there be that ^^ste have one
amerous man / to whom they keep hem treuly. Other be many that be full of
words and le^e their ^^ris to all the world. Other love to have acye and
tokenes ^d they make like signs also far as they may not speak to he^: Other
there ben that been more pray^^ and requyrid for to enyoye them ^o to have their
grace. tha^ the gods ben for to have their fair paradys* For tabregge and
shortly conclude: Certes gentle knyght^ they be well happy that have not to
do with them money such receptes / and they be foles that have to do much
with hem / for he that may p^sse f^o^ them / may do no better tha^ to withdraw
him fer from'hem in f^eyng the places / and all the circumstan^ces: Sire
answerde than Jason I ^uppose and think well that ye could say much better
if ye voolde / first as to the regard for to have. ij. stre^ges on his ^owe /
That is to understand: two ladies. certes it is not possible that he that so
does. may be ^s^^^t in his works ne in his thoughts / for no man may well
serve. ij. maistres. for that one corrumpeth that other / Then^e it is so /
that if a noble man for to auau^ce him self in worship may do no better
then^e for to chese an honorable lad^ which he may love treuly secretly and
so perfaytly that he sere and dread to do^ any thing but that yt be honest in
all thingis ^d of ^ecom^andacio^ ^or all ladies desire nothing but honor and
hye ^enommce hit is their propre vocacion and their naturell condycion. then^e
how shall he have desir^ of honor that is no true lover / for he that is
double is to much outrew and falls. and if any well or honor happen to come to
him / it is agayn^^ reason / right / and good equy^e: and if there be any such.
certes they be not worthy to lyue^ seen that the ladies be^ of ^o parfou^de
excelle^^^. that the leest of all is worthy to have the best knight of all the
world. And for that cause say no more: that ^ take two cords or str^ges on my
^owe: For certainly I had lever to receive and p^ssee the destrayt of death

When thauncie^t knight had understand tha^swer of ^ason / he was much
abasshid and said to him: that he would never hold that way ne purpose.
wherefore fair sire said ^ason. for asmoche said the knight that me^ should
mocque hi / for j suppose well to know that if right now ye should chese of two
thingesone / That is to we^e to receyne death / or ellis chese a new ladi. that
ye would more sone the lady tha^ the death. and for good cause Certes there ben
ple^te of amoreusis that sustain and swear / that for to sane thonour of their
ladies. they would atte^de and take the death / But I suppose if they saw the
death come they would no more abide him then^e the quayle abides the sperhauke /
and for al^^ these rayson^s above said I counceylle you that ye leave this
errors and opynyons. and reco^forte your self the best wise ye can in your
maladye ^or by mine advise I believe not that you^ pain be mortal: and I have
not herd say that evyr any man amerous by maladye of love lost his life: But
if he went out of his mind:

aso^ with these words could no more reply^que for he apperceyued that he could
not make his matter goodner maintene it against the old knight / and thu^ending
their parlame^t / he s^epte unto the time it was nygh day. And then^e Jason
awoke and began to make new sighs inso much / that thauncient knight herd
it ^gayn. hou well that he was a s^epe and was suddenly awaked And then^e wha^
Jason knew that he was awaked he salewed him and gaf him good morrow and said
to him / Sire knigt because of your great ageye have seen much thing in your
time. ^ demand you by your faith if ye have knowleche i^ dremes / wher^ore axe
ye answerde the ^nyght. For asmoche said Jason. as j hane not cessed this
night to dreme. By my loyaulte ^ayr sire ansuerde the good old knight / if ye
have dremed any thing that have need of exposition or any interpretacion: there
is no man ^ greece that shall better answer thereto: then^e myself: and therefore
without any doubt. Tell me plainly yowr dreme. and I shall expow^e to you the
substance. Certes sire knight said jason / j had a meruaillous dreme this
night. which i^ manner of a pass temps j shall declare to you / for as much as
ye ar con^yng in the science of thexposicio^ thereof / which dreme or vysion was
thy^: Me thou* ghte that j saw. ij. swannes / which were right fair i^ a medo
we. of who^ that one was a male: and that other a female: The male came unto the
female and made semblaunt for to have acompanyed with her. the female set
naught there by. but withdrewe her aback / And when the mal^ saw that / he
entrid unto a ^yuer that was by: and passid over / and ca^ and a lie with me
here i^ this bed / and hit was notlong after / but me thought that the
female passed the ^yuer in like wise / and came unto the chamber door and made
many pyetous cries after her nature that the male might not here for he was
aslepe / And so had I much great pity for the sorowfulllchere that she made
in so much that j awoke / and no more I saw / wherefore I wot never what to
think

When the ancient knight had well understand alonge the dreme of the preu
Jason he said to him in this manner: Sir knight what wole ye say if that
noble lady for who^ ye suffer so much sorrow be as much or more amerous of you
as ye be of her. And by this love she be comen in to this house after you / Ha
a sir knight answerde jason / I have no charge of that stroke / for my lady is
so noble and so endowed of so high beauty that she sets naught by any man
in the world / A^e way fair sir said thau^cient knight your dreme signifies
by thise two swannes Of whom would make the bataylle or thenterpryse that
desires company of the female that ye have willed to be husbonde to your
lady. The which would not here you. and nevertheless when she has known that
/ ye entered on the sea. she entered after in semblable wise. and is come after
you i^to this propre house / where by adventure she is in much great pain for
the love of you: In this faco^n may I prenosticque and dyuyne this werk after
the nature of your dreme

^ason with these words began to sighe right ardan^tly and said. what is
this: and fro whens comes to me this fantasy that may more grieve me then^e
help / I know well that it is a great abuse to me for to think and have a
renouelement of pain and of sorrow O what pain is to a tree we louar infortunat
for to be in co^tynuel martire. Ha a my dear lady why have ye not the eyes so
clear for to behold with in my heart and know in what martyrdom I am / In
what sorrow. and in what anguysshe. Certes madame your eyes basilique have
hurt me unto the death O what distress O what guerdon^ for good service: I
find me in the hands of right hard death But yet for to pass the sonner my
sorrow. j shall pray the gods that j may be eurews after my great
unhappiness. Then^e the sage and ancient knight Mopsius hering the noble preu
Jason thus sorowfully compain him self and lamenting: in favor of noblesse
was greatly enyoyed in courage. and for somoche he said to him i^ this manner.
For gods sake sir knight leave and goo out of this fantasye. for to much to
muse in infortune is nothing prouffytable A man^ with great trauaylle and
labor brings his days to an end having his life trauersid in many
contrary things. There is no man so ewrous and happy that has all way his
will Certes te thyme must be taken as hit comes. is hit hard or soft The
heart of a man shol de not abasshe ^ no thing Me semeth^ we have spoke ynowh^
of love. spraye you that from hens forth we may entte ito an other purpose /
And that ye would tell to me your name and the place of your buyrth / and the
name of your hows and dwelling place Veritably sir knight answerde Iaso than:
If there be any man that may redress and give confort to a desolate heart and
disconforted ye be he most propice above all other: I have founden so much
goodness in you that if ye wole tell me your name with out any fault / I sal
tell you mine also / Fair sire answerde thau^-cie^t knight / your desire is to
me agreeable: in such wise that I shall reco^pre to you my life and all mine
asiate more than any man that I have see^ this. vj. score year / Know ye than
that my name is Mopsius The god nppollo was my fader / j am king of Sylice. I
have conquered the coutre Pamphile. I have had two sons And when they were
come to man's age / I have made them possessours of my lands / and syn I am
deperted in such estate as ye me now see j have be^ in the world. vi. score
year / during which time I have seen and have lerdned ple^te of good and
stran^ge works. prayng you and require that ye show to no person mine estate
ne co^dicio^s by no faco^n of the world / and wha^ so is that ye speak to me
that ye name ne call me none other name but Mopsius openly ne collectly: and
for diuerce cause / Mopsius a^swerde than the noble Jason / syn it so plesith
you to be named and called. j promise you upon my honor that in so much as
touches that ye have said. hit shall beholde^ secret in mine heart also fast
and such manner as ye had closed it in the most hard roche of the world /
and to the regard to say to you how j am named know ye for certain that I am
callid Jason / and am borne of the prouynce of thessaile sone of the gentyl
king Eson of Mirmidone that yet lives as j suppose. but he is much auncieu^.
With these words Mopsius for to make Jason for to forgete his melancolyes. he
began to demand him of the nature of the royaume of myr^^done and of the
countrees about. ad after demanded him of the birthe of his aage and of his
auentures / and after this he enquired of him many other things unto the time
that they began to rise and make hem ready. but what thing that jason said or
herkenyd. he had always his thought on his lady and sighed often times out of
mesure.

Wha^ the two noble kinghtes were risen and clad in point. jaso^ went strayt
in to the stable to his horse. whom^ he louyd well: but inco^tine^t when he had been there alytil and that he had perceyuid the. ij. palfroyes of the lady and
of the damoiselle / hisem^d that he had seen them to fore tyn^ Then^e he callid
the servant of the stable and demanded of him to whom tho two horses belonged
Then^e the servant a^suerde that they apperteyned to two damoyselles that were
loggid there with inn: Truly friend said jnso^ what damoyselles that ever
they be: The two horses belong to my lady best beloved / and when the good
au^cie^t knighte understood Jason he said to hun. Jason remember ye of your
dreme j take hit on my life that your lady is in this house / or ellis the
damoiselles ben here sor her the which shall say to you good tidings.
Without any other question or answer jason departed inco^tment from the
slable / and wete unto the hostess. ^ when he had boden to her good morrow he
said to her Fair hostess / know ye the two da moyselles that belongged here
in. Certes sir knight answerde the hostess I know hem none other wise but as
me seems that they ben ge^til women and come^ of a good hows / Is hit possible
that I may see hem said Jason j wot never said thostes / se but j first
demand the^. Fair hostess said than Jason j require you that j may see the^
/ And that ye will go say that here is a knight their serimin^t that has
great desire to speak with them

The good hostesie for to do playsit unto jason. went unto the two
damoyselles and said to the^ My fair may stresses i^ come to you in the name
and at the request of a gentle knight he sayng your servant. the which
requires you / that of your grace hit would plese you that he might speak with
you / And advise you what hit shall plese you that I answer to him. But
incontinent that the Queen Myrro had herd her hostess speak of the request of
the knight. Certes the color began to change meruailloussy / and her thought
that all her body wasesprised with fire / But this no withstanding she held her
contenaunce the best wise she might / And how well that she doubted of the
coming of the pren Jason / and that she was tha^ in a trau^ce what she should
say to her / yet answered and said. fair daine: who is that knight that has
sent you hither / Certes said the hostess / I saw him never to fore that I
wot of / But to my semi^g he is the most gentil and the most well made of body
and also most curtois that any man may or can find or speak of / Danie said
then^e the fair Mirro / syn that he is so vtuous and so well accomplisshed ns
ye say: do hi to come hither. With these words the good hostess did do
jason come unto the chamber / And then^e as soon as he came in. he beheld the
noble Queen which was tyght shamefaste / and having the heart shytte and
rauisshid made unto her the reverence and salewed her And the fair mirro
welcomed and salewed hun again much curtoissy / This do^ they entrid into
devises: and then^e after certain words Jason said to the queen in this manner

^ertes my dear lady j had not known that ye had be^ in this hostelrye ne
had^be^ your two palfroies Which j have this morenyng found in the stable by
my horse. and yet wha^ I had seen and known them j had not supposed that ye had
be^ in this hows / how well when j understood that the two passroyes belonged to
you Oamoiselles / wenyng that here had been two of your damoiselles I am comen
for to here tydinges of you: Certes sire knight j doubt not the contrary /
and in like wise j had not supposed ner thought to have founden you now here:
and I declare to you that j am departed secretly for to goo a pilgremage: where
I have pr^mysed long syn accompanied o^^^ with this danioy selle. and j auo w^^
so to goo i^ the most stre^gthe of the war: and j have great me^^nylle for
to see you now here. For without doubt j had supposed that ye had been this
our in olyferne at your rest

^adame answerde Jason I have none hope that ever ye shall see me more in
^^^^erne / Certes jason fair sire^^ (...) and much fwift in your works / I
have good will and great desire for to reward and co^tente you of the good
and agreeable services that ye to fore this time have donn to me during my war
in persecuting and delivering of my morbell enemies / and yfye resoume not to
Olyferns / I may not ner can not do rew^^de and conte^te you / Ha a my dear
lady answerde than jason As j said you that other day i^ your yalays: I have
not seruid you in such wise as j have could best do / for menoye or other
meuable gods. but I have employed my self only for to gefe your love and your
godde g^ce: I have paternall richesses largely / and therefore j say to you so
much / that if so be that ye grant not me your love: ye may not content me.
And know ye certainly that after this day ye shall never see me For as your
tree we lover and humble servant quamnguer donned. I shall goo withdraw me ito
some deserte. be wayling and weping that part after you. And unto my death j wole
do non other wise. wherefore I you supply with all my heart that pity may
enter into your noble cora ge: in such wise that on me your pour suppliau^t /
ye have pity and mercy / and ellis of me ye shall never see good.

When the noble lady had understand that said is / She answerde to the preu
jaso in this manner. Certes sir knight there is no heart of lady so hard / but
by the virtue of your requests musie needs be softed and molefied / ye have
sernid mehyely and well in all tronth and loyaulte / In all vailliau^ce and
diligence: ^ confess knowleche hit ye require me as I under stand that I
should be your w^f and felaw / a more gretter thing ye may not deman^de me. ne
that more me toncheth. Nevertheless wha^ j apperceyue your great and good
valoir. to the^de that ye have no cause for to fall in despair j am content
for to accord my self unto your prayers and requests. for seen always that ye
shall goo into your country: And there ye shall assemble your most next
parents and fre^des. which ye shall bri^ge into my cite that in their presence
ye shall wedde and spowse me solemp^ly.

The noble and vayllau^t knight jason thanked the fair myrro of this good
answer. and promised to her to do and accomplisshe treuly all that she had
desired. that is to wete that he should goo into myrinidone for tassemble his
fre^des and alyes and that he should return into oliferne to marye and wedde
her in their presence* But wha^ the damoyselle that was comen with the queen
for to hold her company / herd such or seniblable promesses made by her
maistresse / which was so well comen to the point of her desir: she was
replenysshed with ^solacion and yoye / and forthwith she came between the. ij.
lovers and said to the^^ that she called all the gods to witness and thanked
the^ for this aliau^ce. Certes than said the fair Myrro. ^yn that ye have don
so much / I would well that we had leyzer and place for to make good chere to
geder / but as me seems hit may not now goodli be don / for in no wise j would
not be^ beknowe^: but hit behooves for mine honor and whorship. that Jason
depart from hens inco^tine^t with out longer tarieng / to the^de that none
speak of us but al well: and we shall goo secretli to the poort for to get us
som^e good maronner. which shall bring us unto our secret pylgremage

Ia^o the noble prince hering the fair mirro so ordeyne and conclude of their
sodayn departing began to make simple chere / for he was ^ore abasshid and
soroufull in such wise to love his lady / whom he saw endowed with so hye
^tues. Certes he had entenco^n to have told to the queen a part of his sorrow
and bewaili^ges / that he had made for her sake: But she would in no wise here
him: but smyling she took her leave in somoch that jason e^braced and kissed her
ones or twyes. finably he departed from thens promitting her that in short time
he should return unto her again and as soon as he was departed and gou^ his
way the fair. Mirro and the Damoyselle did do sadle their horses / and rode
to the port where they took their shipping and went to the sea

For tabregge our history without (...) aue^^ire that ought to be remembrid
their maro^ner exploited i^ such wys^ with help of the good wind that he
had. that in short time he deliuerid the queen Mirro and her damoiselle i^
olyferne: where they tarried after Jason right long and in right great anoye and
displaisi^ as it shall be said alo^g and declared here after / But now j shall
rest to speak of the* fair Myrro and of her faytes for this present time / and
shall recompte of the co^duyte of jason: which de^ied fro the presence of his
lady as said* js: and returned with all diligence unto mopsius the good old
knight right yoyous / and said to him: what was happe^d of his dreme evyry
thing. and that he had herd of his lady good tydinges: how well he declared
not to him that he had spoken to her i^ her propre person. But he made him
understand that ij. of her damoyselles had promised to him and sworn^ that if
he would go into oliferne accompayned of his kinnesmen and friends that they
should do somoche anenst his lady that she should espouse and wedde him and that
she should crown him king of her con^trey / And for so much said Jason that I
have taken affiance in the promise of these two damoiselles* j shall goo into
my country for tasse^ble my friends and kinnesmen in the most goodly and hasty
wise j shall mow and I shall not cesse unto the time I shall come to the above
of my love wherein I have good hoope

How peleus brother of king Eso of myrmidone and oncle of Jason went unto the
temple of Appollo. and how he had answer that the first man that he met
with an hose on that one foot and none on that other should empesshe hi^ of the
royaume of myr^ midone which he had ^npposid to have enjoyed



THus as jaso^ reherceth these tidinges unto the good and ancient knight
mopstus / the sone of the king of that cite named the seus came unto them there.
Which was advertised by the marcha^tes: that jason had sauid by his
vaylliau^ce: and deliuerid from the furour and tyranny of the perurrse king
dyoinedes / And from as far as he had espied jason he knew him. For he had
seen him to fore at the weddyng* of perytheon. And then^e he saluwed him with
great chere: The preu jason rendryd again joyous^y his salewyng unto teseus.
And when they had each other welcomed theseus brought jason and Mopsius for
the love of Jason unto the king his fader / which was named Egeus. and wha^
the said king saw jason / he did he^ much great honor and worship for his
hye reno^me. and fested him in diuerce manners. and Jason desired nothing sauf
to return unto his country: and thanked him of the worship that he had dou^
to him and of his right good chere. and ^yn took leave of the king. of Theseus.
and of mopsius. the which knowing that he was right noble and right vayllau^t
knight said to him. that they would goo with him. and hold him copanye unto
his countreye. whereof the noble preu jason desired the^ that they should abide
and not goo with him / for he would not goo the right way / But this was for
naught: for they said plainly that they would hold their promise And Jason
wist not what to say. but accorded to the^ that they should goo to gyder unto
Myrmidone

Jason then^e Theseus and Mopsius departed from Athenes at three: and did so
much by land and by watre / without any aue^ture digne of memory / that
they came unto the Cite of Myrmidone where was yet living the noble king Eson.
Peleus came then^e against the noble preu jason: and welcomed him with his body
but not with his heart. maki^g great sign to be right yoyous of his retornyng.
And brought him unto his fader the old king / which was greatly conforted of
the coming of his dear sone Jason. And wha^ the noble preu jason had made the
reverence unto the king his fader. the king demanded him of his tydinges / and
where he had been and what he had done. Jason without taking on him any vayn
glory of any hye and great work that he had done and brought to end.
ansuerde to him by great humilite sayng. Dear sir I come now strayt from the
seruyse of the noble queen Mirro / which is lady of the noble cite of
olyferne: and the most sage / the most fair. and the most discre^e that is in
the remenaunt of at the world / and at such time as j arrived in her court /
she was in a mereayllous tribulacyo^ by the right puissau^t king of Esklauonye
/ which made her war of fire and of blood. for somoche n^she would in no wise
co^sente to take him to her husbond. But syn my coming to that part and that I
had charge as heed and as conduytour of her men j enterprysed to sustain the
quarele of the noble lady / And in three batailles where I was accompanied of
her people. the gods have given us victory upon the Esclauons. in such manner
that the king him selue and the most part of his men^ have been slain and
smyten in pieces And among all other there was in the host of the said king
of Esclauonye / a meruaillous and puissau^t man / a geant named Corfus: The
which had put to death many a goodknight of olyferne. With who^ I faughte
body against body. not by my strength that was in me. but by desire to get
the worship and honor. and to do that thing that might bring me in to the
grace of that noble lady. whom j put to vttrance by the virtue of the great
beauty. of her. and to her apperteyneth the right worship and honor And syn
that i^ have said to you so much / and that hit is reason that ye know all:
I declare to you that I come now to you in ente^cion^. that my kennes men and
friends be assembled for to hold me company to goo and wedde her so hye and
so noble a lady / the which is conte^te to be my wife / forseen that I should
e^pouse and wed her hononrably asit apperteyneth to the daughter of a king. For
by thise condycions ben the promesses made and accorded.

The noble and ancient king Eson heering thise tidings had much more joye at
his heart then^e he had a fore and said. Certes my dear sone I am right yoyous
of thy well and worship* of thy prouffit and of thyn auau^ceme^t. I think well
that fortune has been socourable to the noble lady / to who^ thou have ben
servant. but with right great pain may I believe that thou allone have
vay^^uyssh^d the geant. and if it be so j thank the gods / but late it pass
forth. and if thou have gotten the grace of her so fair and so noble ladi j have
no great marvel there of: for love ^ such a caas beholds no person And
never the less to the end that thou know how j desire above all thing of the
world to see multiplicacio^ in thy seed. j shall array thens to the sone of a
king is lawful and apperteynyng: and j shall send the so well i^ point of
abilleme^s of war and of noble men^ acco^payned / that by raison she ought
have suffisau^ce Then^e the preu jason thanked the king his fad of this good
answer: And at that time they spak no more of the matere / but intended to
feste Mopsius and Theseus. whom they prayed to tarry. and accompanye jaso^ unto
the day of his wedding and the two good knigtes promised that they should so
do: and so they were greatly fested of the king and of his nobles / and also of
Peleus which did it again his heart making a fained chere

Among many deuyses Mopsius and Theseus recompted of jason thau^ture that he
had i^ Trace against the tyrant king Dyomedes and lykened Jason for his
vayliau^ce and habilite unto his felaw Hercules / which was the most strong
man and best assewred that was under the clouds: And because ^f his high
preysinges and recom^endacio^s the bruyt of preu jason augme^tid and encresid
from day to day: And hit is not to be vnreme^brid that the^uie of the untrue
peleus grew so terribly that he by no faco^n might ne co^ude have no rest
day ne night. in so much that in the coming again of noble jaso^ he was
advertised that in the isle of delphos the god appollo gaf a^swers of things
that were to come and of all destinees: wherefore he went him self into that
isle and entrid into the temple anoyed meruaillously and pe^sif. and wha^ he had
made his oris^^ by great deuocio^ and consequently his dema^d for to know
whether ever he should eniyoe the royaume of mirmidone. The devil which was in
the ydole that herd him / a^suerde to hi that the royame should be taken from
him by the hand of a man that he should mete having non^ hose ner shoo / o^ that
one foot Peleus heri^g this hard answer was meruaillously abashed. and
departed from the^s so passing soroufull. that he seemed better a man nourisshed
in all his life in sorrow or conde^pned to cruel death tha^ any other wise: as hit
shall be declared here after a long

As then^e Peleus was i^ this retourning unto Mirmidone always conspiring the
death of the right noble j a so. and ymaginyng how he might resist his
miserable and folissh destine / a good old knight met him on the way. This
knight began to behold hi^ in his plain vysage and the salutacion of the^
both given and rendered And knowing that he was much pe^sif and full of
mela^colies / he devised to him of many things and meruayles of the world And
among all other devises he said to hi^. that in a isle standing upon the este
see / was a much rich and noble moton^ or sheep having his flees all of fyn
gold. the which was not possible to be co^querd And that many vailau^t
knights had lost there their life These devises taken an end. the two knights
deperted each from other: and then^e peleus reentryng into his mela^colyes
thinking much on the a^swere that he had received of the god Appollo. and
concluded in him self that if hit happend that he mete Jason barfoot on that
one foot: he should find the maneres if he might to send him into the isle:
whereof the knight had told him / that the rich moto^ or flees of gold was: to
the^de that he might be there devoured and never return again What shall j
say more / the perverse and untrue peleus passid forth on his way in such
conspiracions ayen^t jason / and came so far that he fon^de his neuewe Jason
in a medowe by myrmidone

Certes the noble jason and Theseus were then^e in a medowe with many noble
bachelors of the country: passing her time in maki^g ple^te of diuerce
esbateme^ts and plays in stre^gthe of body. as wrastlyng / lepi^g: rennyng /
casti^g the bar or stone or drawing the bow. and wha^ jason saw his uncle
peleus come / he went to hi^ sor to welcome hi^. and was vnhosed and vnshoed
on his right foot. and made to him the reverence: And then^e peleus: which was
in doubt of hi^ apperceyued anon his foot bare: how well he said not a
word / but showed a right great sign of love unto his neuewe jason. which
thought nothing of the malice and felon courage of his uncle which was
garnisshid of ypocresye / of traison and of all evil And syn passed forth
sayng to him self / that jaso^ should put him out of the royaume But if he
found some remedy. and that briefly* As ye may understand peleus returned
right sorofull and dolan^t and right desirous for to destroy and do to death
his neuew jason: he frowned in this wise and bote on this lip a great while:
after he be thought him and concluded in him self that he would do ordeyne and
make a rich dinner: to which he would do call all the nobles of the royaume
and of the countries by and adjacent / Sayng that he would show unto his neuew
jason all that he had herd recompted of the noble moton^ or sheep of gold. to
the^de that he should enterprise for to goo to conquer hit. And when he had
made this deliberacio^ in his courage / he sent for to pray and to somone the
most part of the nobles of the Royaume and the countrees by / Which came gladly
unto this feste: and assemblee at the day to them signified. Certes this
Peleus did do garnisshe this dinner with all vy a^des and noble metes delicious
and with beaurages and drinks sumptuous composed with spices. But wha^ al was
ready the most hye baron^s were set at the first tables And among all other
nobles: there was the noble Hercules / and then^e after satte every man after
his astate / and thus after they began on all perties to make great chiere /
and spack of many things* and inespeciall of the hyhe vayllian^ces of the preu
and noble Hercules. and of the monstres and cruel bestes that he had destroyed
and put to death by his vaylliaunce and hardiesse. And thus passed the dinner in
such or semblable devises unto the end that peleu^ came to fore jason. and
said to him in the presence of many Kings Barons and knights in this manner.

Jason my dear lord and neuewe ye ar the man of the world that I love best
next after the king Eso^ my brother iour fader / know ye that I have in mi
heart great joy for to have herd the preysinges and Recommendacions of the
vailliau^t knight Hercules. whom I see here present For the terrible bestes /
for the monstres / and for the great and strong Geants / of whom he had
deliuerid the world of. by his vaisselage: But wha^ I behold your great
puissau^ce corporal / and that next after her / cules ye be one of the most
stre^gest membrid / best asseurid and one of most vaylliauntest knights that
ly / ueth. hit gretely displesith me in my heart that fortune has not give pla
/ ce where your puissaunce and valoir may be shewid. and that your bruit and
reno^mee is not so great as I desire / I would hit had cost me the most part
of the goods the gods hane sent me in this world / and that ye were comen
to your above of an enterprise and co^queste that j kno / we in a place. the
which should be much honorable and recommanded for you and for your lineage
Certes fair uncle answerde jason. I than / ke you greatly of your good will
toward me. j know right well that of ten times ye have hyely cou^ceylled me to
mine honor and worship / a^^ therefore if ye know any aue^ture or e^terprise to
be poursiewed and brought to the end where i^ j* might employe my time. j
require you that I shall do as much as i^ me shall be possible to do to come ^o
mine above of honor and worship to me and of our house.

Certes fair sire Jason answerde the dissoyall and untrue peleus / I take a
great plaisir to see your good will / which proceeds of an noble courage:
and for so much as I know that ye are a knight of hye enterprise / know ye
that in the parties orie^tall is an isle enclosed round about with the sea: In
the which there is so noble and rich sheep or moto^ of such nature / that instead of f^ese of w^lle. he is e^dowed with a f^ese all of fyn gold. But he is
kept with certain bestes so cruel and so fires / that there has been no man so
hardy or so well assewryd unto this present time that durst approach the noble
moton^ or sheep of goolde: if then^e there be in you so much valor and pro
wesse / that ye might co^quere the rich f^^es or this sheep. me thi^keth your
renominee should grow greatly in honor and worship Which is the thing above
all other that every noble heart desires: and in troth me ought desire no
thing somoche. for honor is the principal tresour above all other and the
souerayn recommendacion that any ge^til man may get and ought more to be
desired then^e any worldly thing: To this a^swerde Jason. by all our gods
fair uncle I am much beholde^ to you in many maneres For j know and am
certain verayly / that honor ought to be preferrid and put to fore all
worldly things / and to the end that men may see the grette affection and
desire to get worship is so nyhe my^ heart / and that the covetous desire of
glory and honor be not i^ me reputed faynedly / I make here a s^lempne auowe
unto the gods and promise here in the presence of all the nobles that been
here asse^blid. that j shall never cesse to labor to seche the rich sheep or
fsese of gold unto the time that I shall have founden it / and that I shall d^o
the vtterist of my power for to conquer hit / what some ever danger or parill
fall or happen to me in the con^^st When Peleus had herd this a^^we he was
much joyous: and him seemed that the work went well forth in so much that him
thought and supposed by this me^e for to come to the above of his desir. Certes
the noble and preu Hercules and Theseus preisid much jaso^ of his enterprise
And forthwith i^ fayte they vowed i^ like wise that if jason achieuid not his
e^terprise that they should put he^ in deuoir for to bring hit to an end and
during this dinner they spack long and devised much of the manner of the vow of
jason and above all other pe leus was so glad and yoyous that he prolonged and
held great solemn feste eyghte days long / and advertised the king eson of
the right noble enterprise of his sone Jason. always eson notwithstandin^g
thenterpris / was dangerous and mortal. yet was sie well content that his sone
should achieue his auowe: For tabregge the matter peleus sent for many werkemen
for to make a ship / and among all other there was one named Argos the which
ordained to hi one so fair and so subtille a work that never was seen such /
and was calud Argyne because of argos

Certes this Argos was a passing wise man and vtuous. and me^pecial he was the
most learned and expert maro^ner that was in that time i^ all greece. And wha^
this ship was made he advertised peleus and jason also which was as glad and
joyous as he might be. for all that euyr was necessary for him he fond it ready
and the ship arayd and ready for to depart. Theu^e Jason took leave of the king
his fader and of his uncle peleus. And so did the noble Hercules Theseus and
Mopsius and other unto the no^bre of an honderd knights of greece / which
would accompanye jason in this voyage / and this license and co^gie taken with
all diligence they entered in to the ship the hole. C. knights / and wha^ the
good patron argos had disancred from the port where the ship had been made /
which port was named Seferre: he did somoche diligence that he brought this
noble company upon the hye see / where argos sailed with hem many days always
sailing toward the eest after the sight of the sterres and of the son: and so
long he conduy^ed hem in this point that vytailles began to faille them / and
were ^strained by force to goo a land at the first port of frigye named
Thenadon^: which stands nygh unto troy the gran^de. of whom Laomedon^ was
king. which used great rudesse unto jason and to the knights of his company.
and this evil fill upon him afterward and upon his subgettes / He was not
greatly to be complained as it shall be declared along here after in this
present volume

How the king Laomedon^ of Troy would not suffer Iaso^ne his company
descend on the land / and how the queen Ysiphyle received them


IN this paas says one history that Argos the good and subtle maronner made
and ordey^ed all things that failled un to the noble ship where the noble
knight was in under saylle. And the wind blewe there in at their will. h^^
was about x. of the clock a fore none / the fair son shone clear and
spredde his rays upon the land / and the weder was soft and well disposed.
And at that time much people were upon the ba^kes of the sea which ^ehelde
from far the noble ship of the Greeks. which a^ said is ca^ that time the
sayll^ displayed and set upon a hy^e: and saylled fast in his course upon the sea whereof they were so sore ameruaylled / that they wiste not what thing hit
might be: In so much that sum of them were so sore aferd / that they fled
in to Troy. And the other abood at the port abydi^g thaue^ture. They that
fled to wit i^ troy went unto the puissaunt king Laomedou^ / and said to
hi all be wep^e and drowned i^ teeris proredyng of great fe^^ and dread / that
they had apperceyuid from far i^ the feera great monstre lifting him self
meruayllous^y swymming and ^e^ nyng upon the water more swiftely: tha^ an horse
coud run on the ^^ ^inde or on the land. And affermed to the king Laomedon^
by their faith that this monstre without co^pariso^n was more to double and
feere than the monstre that hercules had slain by his hye vaillyau^ce. Certes
in this said country to fore that time Hercules had slain a monstre also great
as a wale / as hit is plainly contained in thistorie of hercules Wha^ the king
Laomedon^ had herd these tydinges reherced: he was all abasshid / Then^e he
made one of his knights to take an horse a ^swift as the wind: and s^te him to
thenadon^ for to axe and inquire of the troth. What thing hit might be that
the people were so sore aferd of. And in such wise exploited the knight that he
ca^ to the port of thenadon^and there he found the preu jason and his
knights of Greece. but first he aspied argos that a^kred his ship right nyghh
to thenedon^^and went not into the toun^ for asmoche as it was no need /
^sideri^g that they were nygh the cite of Troy / which was so great i^
magnifice^ce that there was no like in the remanau^t of the world / he inquired
first of the habitau^ts and dwellars of the country if they had seen any such
monstre on the sea: Then^e the me^ of the country answerde to the knight. that
they had seen no such monstre upon the sea / and they that had brought such
tidinges to Troy were greatly abused to have seen any monstre / and that there
was none other thing but a^ ship of greece saillyng on the sea in the which
by their advise were great nombre of knights of Greece Right well in point of
arms. and such things as should be needful and necessary for the^ to enter
into bataille

WHa^ the knight of troy had understand all that said is he descended of his
horse and went a foot unto the knights of Greece: To whom he demanded what
they sought and had to do in that country Than jason answered to the knight
that great necessite of vitaylle for ^o trauerse into far countrees caused
the^ for to take their poorte there and non^ other thing. Inco^tine^t wha^ the
knight had understand these tidiges he returned and took his horse and rood
unto the king his lord and recou^ted to him all that he had exployted. Than
the king Laomedon^ thus advertised of the desce^te of the knights of Greece and
understood that they were descended for to vytaille their ships / ymagined
anon^. that they were espyes: which Hercules had sent theder for tespye the
roiaume. wherefore he renuoyed and sent again the knight unto the greeks and
com^anded the^ straytly. that they dispose them with all diligence for to
depart out of his land. and to go ellis where to seek vytailles if they had
need: And if they departed not sodaynli and disancred and took some other way /
he should come with his puissaunce in Arms upon them so myghtily that never
after they should have will for tespie royaume cite castle ne country

Than when jason and his felawship had herd thexpresse and rude commau^deme^t
of the Troyan king They were sore displesid and not without cause. for asmoch
as they must needs depart / Than the noble jason for the better: a^swerd
curtoyssy unto the knight / and showed him that they were not come^ theder for
to espy the royaulme ne the cytees / castles ne country of the king Laomedo^
ne of none other. wha^ herculs herd thanswere of jason which hi seemed was to
benygne considering how Laomedon^ had commanded them. he might not hold
his pees but took the words from Jason and said to the knight in this maner^.
know thou knight syn that Laomedon^ as vyllayn of heart and banisshed from all
noblesse has refused to jason of Myrnndone vytaylles for his moneie / that
there shall descend in short time at the parts of this country men in the name
of Jason: and that in so great nombre that all his roiaume. his citees. towns
and castles shall be put in such ruin and perplexite that in fyfty year after
shall not be founden a stone ner no corn^ shall be erid ^e sowen^: Fair lords
then^e a^swerde the knight of troy. j am sorry that ye at not better co^te^t
with the king my lord and that he has not received you other wise in his
country / And ye know well. that where curtoysie is shewid hit bleueth not
vnrecompe^sid. ne Rygour in like wise but if hit be remembrid* and for as much
as I am a mesfager. j shall gladly make unto king Laomedo^ report of that j
have founde^ of you / and with thise words the knight returned unto Troy

THen^e the preu Iaso^ demanded Argos / and said to hi that they must
disa^cre and depart fro thens but if they would abide the cruelte and furour
of the king Laomedon^ and of all his power Then^e the good patron Argos and
his maronners disancred the noble ship: and went again to the sea. where sone
after the wind began to rise and tempest horrible and impetuose: But ^ the
troyan^ knight which was messager as soon as he was come^ to for his lord ^
had made his reverence the king deman^ded him what was become^ of the
glontons of greece that were come and had descended on his land for tespye
his Royaulme / and his citees / The knight a^suerde and said. Sire j have done
to the^ your message. They be^ a great nombre of knights. and resemble well by
their co^tenan^ce and habylleme^s that they ben deperted from noble and good
houses and know for certain that wha^ I had (...) your message / one of the^
that se^^ed virtuous and discrete a^swerde me that they were not come^ theder
but only for vytaylle / and for to pass forth on their way / and that they
were no rob^eurs ne pirates of the sea / but when the young knight which was
fair and curtois as a maid had finisshid his purpose / Another of them /
which had a meruaillous and cruel chiere. and better resembled Hercules by
his vysage and co^tenan^ce then^e any other: said to me in a great anger and
fiexte in this manner. know thou knight that syn that Laomedon^ thy master as
vyllayn of heart and banisshid from all nobi^sse has reffused to Jason of
Myrmidone vitaylles for his money: That in short time shall desce^de into his
countrees men^ in the name of Iaso^ and in so gre^e no^bre / that all his
royaume his cytees towns and chastels shall be put to such ruin perplexite and
destruction that within fyfty year after. shall not be found one stone upon an
other / nor no corn^ shall be sown and er^d upon the ground. And forth with
they have disa^cred and sone after they had sailled by force of wind: and
rowyng of oores so far that j had lost the sight of them Wha^ the king
laomedon^ had understand the report that his knight made to hi. he was so
angry. that he seemed better frantyk or out of his wit then^e other wise and
said well that if he had known tofore what they had be^ and their entente / he
hadd he^ all have don^dye myserably: and therwyth the messager deperted and
laomedon^ withdrew him into his cha^bres sore troubled and pe^fif for the
menaces of the knights of greece. whom^ he knew not but by raporte of the
knight: which knights being then^e well forth upon the sea / were sore ^exed
with great wides blowing on all sides / with tho^ders / with raynes / and great
orages and te^pestes / which ro^ed so hugely and terribly that the air was
trobled and the weder was so derk. that the son shone not in. iiij. days
during that the te^peste seced not / in which tune their vytailles faylled in
such wise that the knights of greece had not to ete / and their ship was oste
times in much great paryl: for i^ the^de a meruaillo: is turbilloun of wind
roose i^ the sea that blewe a way their sail and all to brake their mast /
that the cords and roopes were broken ^to pieces / but fortune help he^ in
this need For notwithstanding this great aue^ture the ship was ^duyted unto a
port named Le^nos where he hurtlyd again the ground in such a ra^don^ and
force that hit was all to broken and re^te that they that were with in were i^
great danger. and had be^ i^ worse caa^ tha^ they were to fore / if they had
not set foot a land

This port was callid Le^nos after the name of a much puissaunt cite which
was rychely set not far the^s but inco^tine^t that the grekyssh knights
had taken land seeing the great danger that they had be^ inn sprang out
of the ship: which anon was filled full of water / And wha^ they saw he^ out
of that mortau^ parill and had well supposed / for to have be^ ^ sau^^e:
Suddenly came out of Lennos the rich cite moo then^e fyfty thousand women^ /
armed garnisshed with pennon^s and recognysan^ces which came re^gyng them in
fair ordenan^ce a long by the cooste of the sea. fast by the port. and after
they sent two of their women messagiers for to somene the grekyssh knights
for to ree^tre into the sea with out any long (...) / But wha^ Jason understood
the somaco^n that the two damoiselles made / he was sore abasshid and not
withh^ut cause / for he apperceyuyd tofore so many hedes armed that he knew
not the nombre. and syn confiderid how they had been in great danger by the
fortune of the sea / and that vytailles failled them: and that worse was he
saw his ship all to broken / which was on all sides full of water: This
notwithstanding by cause he ne would discorage ne abasshe his felawship more
then^e they were. he showed well that he had good courage / and said to one of
the two damoyselles in answering to her message

Noble damoiselle I hane right well vnderstande^ your som^acion I pray you of
your grace that it may plese you to say to me. into what country fortune has
brought us at this time. and for what cause j am b^yow sommenid for to ree^tre
unto the sea Certes sire knight answerde the damoiselle / The country that ye
be arryiled in is not right great. but it is rygh^fertyle and comodious / and
hi^ is named Lennos after the name of this cite here by. Which is named after
the same name: And as to the Regard of the rayson and cause. why this
som^acion is made thus to you I will well that ye know to the end that ye hold
you te better content / That hit happend now late that in this cite of Le^nos
was a king named Thoas. This king had great war against the Argiens / and
for to mayntene this war. he had with him all the men young and old. And
left this cite wihout men whereof the ladies damoiselles and other of the cite
were right evil content. and seeing that they were withonte men / they
assembled them to geder with the daughter of the king which is named Ysiphile
/ and by meure deliberaco^n sent to the king and to their husbo^des / that they
should return into their cite. upon which the king Toas a^suerde / that he
had besieged his enemies and if his cite should be lost he would not deperte
from his ooste unto the end of his war

When the ladies and damoyselles of the Cite had herd this answer / they
took hit evil in gree. and yet they ^ent again unto the king and to these
husbo^des that they should come and return home unto their cite But that was for
naught: for they would no thing do after their desire / And wha^ the ladies
saw this they conspired against the king and their husbondes. and put to death
all the men children that were in the cite: after they detmined and iuged that
if their husbondes or faders. parents and fre^des came again from the war or
other what someuer they were should be slain the first night of their comi^g
as soon as they should be a sleep / and that never after they should suffer noma^
to enter in to their cite / after this conclusion taken they crowned ysiphile
queen upon them. and afterward wha^ the king was returned from the war with
his people. the ladies and damoiselles of the cite did with their faders
husbo^des and parents and other in such wise as they had concluded to fore. in
somoche that of al them that returned from this war escaped none from this
murdre and pestilence but he was slain and murdrid. reseruyd the king Thoas /
Who^ the queen ysiphile would i^ no wise murdre / but this notwithstanding she
deliuerid hi^ i^to the hands of the ladies which put him in a boot allone.
and sent him to the sea in exyliug and banisshing him out of his royaume.

When this damoisell as messagere had recompted unto the noble jaso^ this that
said is. That other messager took the word fro her and said Lords and
knights my felaw has said and told you now the reason and cause: wherefore ye
may not be received i^to this cite / and therefore er gretter meschief befalle
and come to you: withdraw you unto the sea / for if ye tarry here long. the
ladies will assail you asperly / and shall deliuere to you a meruaillous
battle / Jason ansuerde and said / by all my gods fair lady / our ship is
all to broken and for frusshid as ye may see and is full of watre / And on that
other side we perisshe for hunger if we be not shortly socourid: for hit is two
days past syn we ete any morsel mete / and therefore if it must needs be and
no remedy we had lever to deye by glayues and war / then^e by famyne: how
well by your g^ce ye shall return unto the Queen and ladies: ^ reco^pte to the^
our estate and necessite And that we all to geder pray them and require
instantly if there be in hem any virtue or noblesse that they will now show hit
having pity on us. for the fortune of the sea that has trauaylled us by many
days in such wise that we supposed to have perisshid from our to our has
brought us hither / as ye may see against the will of our maro^ners and of us

With this request the two damoiselles messagieres returned in to their cite
unto their queen ysiphile and other ladies to whom they reco^pted from word the
word the answer that Jason had rendrid and what he required Then^e the queen
having herd the answer of the.ij. messagieres. she axid and inquired what
people these knights of greece were / and of what condition and faco^n / and of
what no^bre they were. Certes madame a^s werd that one of the ij. damoiselles j
saw never i^ my days more goodly men^ ne better spoken: and j suppose there were
never see^ so well faryng me^ and great and upright / so well in point of
habilleme^ts so well taught and so curtays in all manners. and it is to be
supposed that they be^ the choice and piked out of all the humayn people: and
there may well ben of the^ the no^bre of an C. all of one faco^n and of lyk
clothing. Then^e the queen hering the messagiere that so hyely recom^ended the
state of these knights of greece: thinking also of their request. began to have
pite of their mysaue^ture and of their myseases that they have had on the sea
by te^peste. and forth^ with she sent for to fecche four of the^ for to come
and speak with her. w^o^ she would examine Wha^ the honderd knights understood
these tidings: they advised among he^ all which four of the^ they might best
send unto the queen Ysiphile / and ^cluded in one that they would send jason
Hercules theseus / and an other knight named Castor right fair / which came to
fore the queen and great nombre of her damoiselles / And they were not long
come^ but that the queen and her damoyselles were terrybly ^^rifed of the love
of these four knights. For there was nether Queen ne damoiselle but desirid
with all their heart their company for the singular and especial beauty of
each of the^. Certes ysiphile at thinstaunt that her two noble eye^ had
beholde^ the great beauty of jaso^ / she was become^ so much amerous as was
possible as of the most fair / the most gracious and the most couoytable of
the iiij. Tha she spack to he^ and demanded the^ in general. what they sought
in her royaume. and whe^s they ca^ and whyther they would goo / and of what
country they were. Then^e the noble Jason thinking of the dema^des of the
queen considering the great danger where they were in. and the necessite of
famyne and hunger that surmou^ted / he as capiteyn and chief of the vyage /
a^suerde humbly sayng in this manner Madame plese hit you to know that we ben
the no^bre of an honderd knights all gentill men^ of one company and of one
country. we be^ departed in one ship But we have had upon the sea so many
infortunes by tempeste of wi^des and of orages that hath^ holden us so long in
great doubt to be perisshid: that vytailles be^ faylled us two days passid /
and for to make short we goo to seche vitailles for to help our necessite /
and syn hit plesith^ you to know from what country we be^ parted and whither
we atte^de to goo / I declare to you that we come from Greece. and our entente
is to salle so far til we fiude an ysse of the sea: where and is a much
rycl^ moton or shepebering his flese all of fyn gold: the which never knight
yet had the powe^^^ hardine^ for to ^quere ne approach / ne^yther only for to
behold and see For many meruaillous and terrible bestes have it i^ keeping:
Among the which ^ have understand there is a right cruel dragon how well I have
allowed and promised for tauenture my self for to co^quere hiter I ever
return again into my country: or I shall deye in the poursuite thereof as many
knights have don^here to fore / whereof is pity.

Wherefore right hye and noble la / die I require you humbly. that ye will have
mercy and pity on me and of myn^ unfortunate felawes / deyng for distress of
honger and famyne / and that we may have vytailles four our silver and money.
and also grace and leave for to remyse and make our ship / again which is
broken and re^te in taking land upon your seignourye / and lordshipe

Wha^ the noble jason had made his remounstrau^ce unto the queen ysiphile as
said is. she withdrew her ^ perte with her damoiselles. and demanded of the^
what was best to do with thise noble men^ They were as of oppynion that it
should be a great sin and mesfeet for to late the^ there deye for famyne and
honger / And at the^de they ^clude^d that they should be received into their
Cite / notwihsta^ding their ordenan^ces and statutes by them to fore made: in
so much that the^ Queen ysiphile returned unto jason / and said to hi / that
for the honor of noblesse: the ladies woldreceyue him and his felawes in like
wise Then^e the noble jason thanked the queen of this grace right curtoissy /
and did do send for his felawes / that they should come into the cite. which
i^co^tine^t as they knew that they should have vytaylles were passing yoyous
and seemed to them propreli that god was descended among the^ / Tha^ they came
to fore the ladies who^ they sale wed right reverently / and anon as the queen
saw this noble company to fore her in all humilite she deliuerid to an
honderd of her ladies the honderd knights of greece / to each of them one of
their own as for the best as her seemed / and she retained jason for her part /
In so much the greeks entered into the cite with the ladies / and with out
other difficulte / they brought the^ into their houses / each departed from
other. where each lady fested her knight with good viandes and metes after
their power and with good heart: making to them a chiere in such wise ^ faco^n
that many of the knights found he^ so plainly in the grace of their ladies.
in asmoch as they might that they were served with the terms of love / and
more I say not at this time present.

IN contine^t when the queen ysiphile saw that she had jason in her ^aillye.
she was somoche joyous as she might be / she had set all her ente^te to
behold the great beauty of the noble prince. and above all other she desired
to have his acqueyntau^ce / and in the beholding and aduysing him she made so
many gracious signs and tokenes of love. during many days and often times.
But the noble Jason which had his courage set in other place took none head:
how be it she might no longer dure without she should be ded somoch was she
esprysed with his love: and yet she durst not speak one word: and when jason
had soiourned there a certain space and nombre of days. he ordained unto his
patron^moneye that his ship might be set inpoint. and ordained men that
should help him / Then^e Argos set hand unto the werk by right great
diligence: and did so much that in short term the ship was all ready / for
to help he^. But inco^tine^t as the queen jsiphile was thereof advertised she
did do break it by night by any of her damoiselles. and she spack with argos
the good patron and did somoche with him that he assembled all the knights
of greece / and i^ their p^sence said to jaso^. the ship mygt not be made
again for to deperte the^s in vin^. months hole / whereof many of the greeks
were meruayllously joyous.

Wha^ Hercules which had a much noble courage understood these tydinges: he
said unto jaso^ / syn that it is so that they should not depart out of that
country / he would goo see the country about ^ cou^ceylled Jason that he should
abide in the cite for to keep to geder his felawes / and jason accorded thereto
with good / will. Then^e the right vaylliau^t hercules went forth on his
way. all reco^forted tabide all auentures. And hit happend him that he ca^
unto a place of a king named Furius. whom he deliuerid from the arpies / and
enchaced the^ unto the River of sturphale in such wise as it is contained in
the history of the faytes of hercules jason which abode in the cite of Le^nos
as said is: entend gladly unto the dubbing and making of his ship. And
Isiphile on that other side always in her amerouse semblants and regardes /
Mopsius was the most part of the time with Iaso^ and devised often times of the
great beauty of the noble queen myrro: and as he was one a day set at dinner
with jason and Isiphile: he parceyued of the gracious atrayns regardes that
she gaf fte times unto the pren jason / and apperceyued right well that she
had set and given to him all her love: and thus passed he the mele with
out any word or semblau^t making. But after the dinner he callid Jason. And
said thus to him* That he would goo walk with him unto his ship and so
deperted out of the halle they two a^^o^ne. and then^e when they were in the
field / mopsius said to jason / Certes sire I would fayn axe you a demand if
it were yonr playsir / Fair sire said then^e Jason / Late not for any thing
but declare your courage and desir / than mopsius demanded him: if he were any
thing amerous of the queen ysiphile. Jason swear to mopsius that he was not
amerous of her: Certes sir said Mopsius I am all certain that Ysiphile is
terribly amerous of you And therefore j advertise you to the^de that ye find
the menes for to speak to her a perte. for if ye may attyne thereto yt should be
to you a right fair pass temps for a space / and we all should fare the better

By all my gods answered then^e the preu jason. er I would use any dissoyalte
against my lady the fair Myrro: I had lever be condem^ned to bring to end
and adchieue as many perilous auentures. as ever the worthy hercules achieued
er ever j should return again to greece The nobles of this time present ben
not so disposed to ensie we the terms of the right renomed prince jason as it
is to fore declared and therefore I counceyll not the ladies that they give no
more affiau^ce than ynowh doubting that by some wey they be not abused / Thus as
the ij. ge^til knights spak of the fair myrto and of ysiphile: they came where
as argos the master patron solicited the werk and making of the ship: and
so passid the time alytil in speki^g of diuerce purposes / And after that they
returned unto their loggys: and the noble queen ysiphile was enamoured i^
such wise on the noble preu. jaso: that she thought on none other thing / but
for to plese him unto her power And he never deperted from the^s but that she
held him co^paignye. or ellis she was always at a window for to look whyther
he went

Wha^ then^e she apperceyued that Jason returned unto his loggyng at this time
/ She went againsi hi and took him by the hand and lade hi into one of her
chambres. where she showed him great party of her rychesses and tresours / And
after she said to him in this manner. Right noble and vailliant knight all
thise rychesses be^ all only at your commandment. and also my body with all:
whereof I make now to you the ghifte and present / And furthermore. j have no
thing of valeur / but that ye shall have at your abandon^ / and will to the end
that I may deserve honorably your g^ce: Then^e wha^ the preu jason had
understand this that said is. he ansuerde to the lady sayng / My dear lady I
thank you right humbly of your curtoy^^e And I declare unto you that in n^
faco^n I have deseruyd the hye honor that ye present to me: Ha / ha gentill
knight said then^e the lady. hit is well in your power for to deserve all if
it be your plaisir / In good troth madame a^suerde then^e jason / if there be
any service or plaisire that I may do unto you. co^ma^de ye it and j shall
acco^plesshe hit freely and with good heart How fair site said she then^e /
will ye acco^plissh my conma^deme^t. certes madame said he j shall not fail in
no point if hit be to me possible. and therefore declarelye to me your good
plaisir and desire. and after that ye shall parceyue how I shall enploye my
self thereto. The queen Ysiphile hering the curtoys answer that jaso^ answered:
was so much joyous and glad that she might ner could be more: and said to
him. Certes fair sire your courtoys and humble words have put me i^ such
danger that in no wise I may no le^ger hyde from you a request / that weyeth
more heuier on my heart / th^a^ a mylne stone should upon my heed. and that long
before this time ye should have known / ne^had ben dame Esperaunce which had
nourisshed and entertiened to hyde my says and courage which at this our j
shall show unto your noble person / and know ye for troth that I have
perceived that ye be of a much noble and ancient hows: above this that ye
excede and pass all men in beauty and in vailliau^ce / if your semblauntlye
not And then^e that I have put in my souenau^ce all thise things I have had
right great desir for to have your love and alia^ce: For which thiges hit is
necessary that I pray you that hit shall plese you to be my husbonde: and I
shall be your wife and espowse: and thus ye shall be king and lord of this thy
royaume / My right dear lady a^swerd then^e the noble preu jason. ye have don
to me a playsir so great in gyui^g to me your gods largely in eting and
drinking and in like wise to my company and felawes: that I may never deserve
it as well for such good as for the love of the ladies to whom I wole obey
with all my might and power in all their commandments And know ye noble
princess. that there is no service ne plaisir but that j am content to do for
you / sauf only this request / for I may not well goodly accord hit unto you
my worship saved and kept / for asmoch as late j have promised unto a noble
lady and of a good place for to take her by marriage / wherefore I require you
that ye will hold me for excused. Ha a jason my dear friend for one promise
ne more ne less what will ye make: men say communely That far is from the
eye / is far from the heart

Wha^ the noble jason saw that the lady oppressid him in such manner that
with great pay ne he wist not how to answer / notwithstanding he said to her
Certes my dear lady j knowleche that the heart of a noble man ought to desire
nothing so much as honor with out reproach Troth hit is that I am bounden by
promise The which if I acquyte not / I am at all days dishonored: I had
lever be deed or condemned to perpetuell exill / and think not madame that I
reffuse your aliaunce for any desdayne / for in good faith j should hold me
right ewrous and well for tunat if I had to wife one so fair a lady. so noble and
so rich as ye ar. Noble knight a^swerd then^e the lady. ye know right well /
how ye and all your company had been deed for honger and of distress. jf j had
not recuyellid you in this cite and fed you and for somoch j pray you yet
ones that ye accord my request / and with out any reproach me thinks by
many raysons that ye ar bounden greatly so to do: I am dryue^ for to require
you in this faco^n: and I ymagyne that the gods have sent you unto this cite
for two causes pri^cipaly / The first is to the^de that ye should be socoured
in this cite / ye and all your company in tharticle of the jeoperdie of
your death where ye were in. And the second: that ye should inhabit this cite
to the^de that hit should not be diserte: For this cite is enhabited with
women^ without king and have non^ other pastor but me which am their chief /
And for so inoche j somene and pray you that ye socoure this cite as she has
socoured you / and that ye ente^de to repeuple all of your seed and in verray
frouth ye so doing shall accomplisshe a virtuous work and of gretter merit
than to maintene a simple promise made unto a lady or damoiselle / hou well
often times they ben made lightly and with right lie occasion they be^
enfrainte and broken^

Madame a^suerde then^e jason. j confess right well that ye and the ladies of
your cite have socoured in our rightgrete necessite / me and my felawship with
vytall. and in reco^pensing whereof there is nothing to us possible but that all
we will enploye us thereto is hit in repeupling this cite or other wise / but to
the regard of my self / j may not co^duyte my self thereto. But if j should
do directly again mine oath: ye ought to know / that mine honor gooth and
touches ner myn^ heart tha^ any other thing / and for so much know ye that
under the couerture of this gracious courtosye I have not ente^eion to co^mise
one so great a^ evil / which should be to me and to mine thing over much
reprochable / Incontinent as ysiphile understood this answer of Jason: and that
she apperceyuyd that he was ferme i^ his purpose / for to abide true unto
hisladi. she spac no more to him of this matere / but took leave of him and
departed. and Jason in like wise wythdrewe him into his chamber. And ysiphile
abode in her chamber sore esprised with love / and on that other side she was
so angry that she might no co^uerte jason. that non^ca^ tell ne write. But
wha^ the profonde derkenes of the night was come / she le^yde her down in her
bed gretely esprised of a^ger and right pe^siue / for i^ her stomak was a
great bataylle between her heart and shame: her courage was than admonested that
she should goo and lie with jason. but shame said nay and withstode it:
wherefore the bataylle was great and dured long / but in the^de therte
vayn^sshid all. For shame was put aback in such wise / that the fair
Ysiphile aroos from her bed and went and leyde her dou^ by jason which than
ssepte. And when she was a bed she began to tremble for asmoche as sha^me
followed her. and so tre^bliug she enbrased jason / and awoke him sayng in this
manner. my verray friend and love jason / your contine^ce and the ^sta^ce of
love have conma^ded me to come to you / how well hit is to me amoche great
shame and vylonye. but sithe that ye have not willed to be my husbo^de and
spouse: at the least ye shall be my love and friend and take ye no desdayne of
the love of a pour folisshe gentil woman

wha^ the noble knight jason herd the fair ysiphyle speak and felt her by him
all naked: he was sore abassijid. Certes her flesh was right tender and
sweet: always she approached to him and he to her. for he was a man / and then^e
wha^ he was awaked he said to he^ in good troth madame I am right sorrowful
and angry that j may not be yonr husbonde / ye she we well how that above all
other ye have me in iour grace A ha and that I now ^re free and without
promise upon my faith / j should be your hnsbo^de and obey you (...) power.

knights of Greece. and many of the^ were conceived with their seed And in this
wise was the cite repeopled of young childere^ masses what shall j make you long
process. The days that have no rest pass lightli. maistre argos rendrid his
ship all repaired and made. and hercules cain again into Le^nos: Jason also
would depart toward his journele / and asseblid one a day his felawship and

and soyourned a much long space of time and yet we have no more knowleche ne
have herd speak of the moton^ of gold or goolden vliese no more. then^e we
herd to fore we departed from our country / I will that ye know that I live
here i^ great sorrow and in terrible great moyan^ce / for I ca^ not take solace

knighte^ had great joye wha^ they herd the good disposicio^ of jason. and they
a^suerde him. that they should be as sone redi as he and then^e one and other
began to pourueye for the^ vytailles: and of all such things as were
necessary for the^ The queen and the other ladies knew anon of the
departeme^t of jason: wherefore they were much displaysau^t and right desolate
/ and sore anoyed the^ to see the Grekysh knights make their p^paracions for
to depart / and that one co^playned to that other sayng / Certes these
knights of greece aba^do^ne us and give us over / we shall never have joye ne
solas The queen ysiphile among the other was most a^guysshous of this departing
/ and ca^ to jason and said to him. Alas / alas lord jaso^. have ye well the
courage for to withdraw you from me and to give me ovyr to fore ye have see^
the fruit of your noble persoe^ / which is nourisshid in my blood / Ha a my

Alas jason: alas my confort prolonge ye and tarry your departeme^tat my request
For j am she that so much loves you that j may no more Alas behold with pite
my womb / the chamber and ma^sion^ of your blood: and in no wise j require you
to depart so hastily I good faith noble lady a^swerde then^e jaso jf j might
abide with you lawfully / j assure you that j would so with good heart / but j
have auowed and promised for to aue^ture my self in the conqueste of the noble
moto^ or flees of gold / I know not how long j shall live ner how long hit
shall be er I come there / hit is force and great necessite for my singular well
and perdurable honor that I employe my time entierly whilis I may and that I
acquyte me dilyge^tly to thacomplissheme^t of my said auowe With this answer
the queen ysiphile had in her heart such anoye: that she began to weep and
right profou^dly to sighe / and after she began to say softly / Alas alas how
may myneye^ see the departing of mine euydent yoye / Alas. alas I was born^ in
an euylle constellcion: when I may not find a little of good fortune in this
world / and all consolacyone wythdrawe them from me. all honor fseeth from
me al bou^tees forsake me and contrary all sorrow ren^eth vpo^me. All welthe is
aye^s^me. and all evil comes to fore me. in my p^se^ce / for certes if there
sourde any mi serie i^ the ferthest place of the world. that misery deperteth
from that place for to come to me. A what sorrow Certes j am not good ynowh ner
of so much vale we that any man shall do any thing at my request

Certes madame a^swerde jaso^ / me seems that for no thing ye ought to demene
ner make so meruaillous sorrow / for ye ar i^ vale we much more then^e j can
exteme / and as to the regard of me if there be any thing licite and honest to
me possible: require ye hit and I shall e^ploye me i^ such wise that ye shall
have cause for to be co^te^te / and me seems that ye ought to have me excused
in this caas see^ the vow in which j am bou^de^ and if j abode here j should
not exployte but lose my time. Ha a my dear friend and love answerde the lady /
wha^ shall I have better cause for to compain and lame^te tha^ now / jf anon^
jhad lost all my royaume. and if j saw all my richesses and cheua^che and all
that j could fine and cheuisshe perisshe in the abysmes and depnes of the sea:
all that should not be to me so heavy to bear at my heart ner so great
displaisir as shall be to me to see your departing. for the sea is so terrible /
and the fortunes. prosperitees / aduersites: and parils rise and lourde on all
sides wherefore j am not certain whether euyr ye shall return again or no. And
then^e ought not j to have the visage banisshid fro all ^solaco^n and yoye:
and ought not my heart to lie on the bed of tribulacion under the couertour
of right mortal distress and between the shetes of bewaylinges / Alas / alas.
think ye what this does / but when I parceyue that there is no remedy / and
that your honor had ^cluded your departing promising to go in your promisid
voyage. j shall bear hit as patiently as to me is possible. forseen that ye
shall promise me faithfully if ye come to your above i^ your enterprise of
Colchos. that ye shall come ageyn by this cite for to tell me of your
tydinges

THan the noble knight understood that the ladi ^desce^ded by such condition
to his departing he was right yoyous and not without cause: ^sideri^g the
dan^ger where he and all his felawship were in: And then^e he promised to her
and swore right solempnly to fore the rep^sentacion of the goddess pallas /
which was there that he should return unto her as soon as he should come to
the above of his enterprise and that if the gods would give him so good
fortune / that he might a live and hole return. Then^e the noble and fair
Queen ysiphile sum what reronforted and ha* (...) a great hope^ the
retournyng of jason cessed her self of her lame^tacions For tabregge the
matere the day came that the noble preu jason should goo to the sea: on which
day the noble prince and his felawes took leave of the noble Queen ysiphile /
of the ladies and damoiselles and thanked them largely of their goods and
good chiere that they had made to the^ / And then^e departed fro Lennos and
went unto the port But wha^ they should enter into the ship. the queen
ysiphile presented unto Jason the ydole of the godde^se pallas and many other
ydoles of the gods of the sea. and made him to put them in his ship /
Sayng that none euyl^e trouble might come to him in any wise ^s log as he kept
and held hem in reverence

When jason apperceyued the great largess of the noble queen ysiphile / and
the good love whet with she louid him. he thanked her much humbly: and syn
went to the sea and made to wind up the sail. And thus he and his company
departed from lennos / for to saille toward the isle of colchos / of whom j
willeue to speak for this present time. and also of Jason and of the Queen
ysiphile / the which when she had born^her fruit by the space of. ix. months
hole / she was deliuerid of a much fair sone For ^o recounte well a long of the
right fair and noble isle of colchos in devising the manner how hit was first
foun^y the god (...) so (...) the country was first (...) ^yted. and (...)
what kings hi^ was governed which is a right difficile and hard thing to
believe for many persons that have not estudied the ancient crony^ues / of
whom many ben full hard and doubtable to be believed for the strange and
meruayllogs works that been founden in many hist^ries and places.

How appollo was sent by the god Mars into the country where as was the rich
and noble sheep or weder that bare the vliese of gold and how he founded there
a cite


Or to give you knowledge of the noble I Will of Col^ shall deporte and tayre for
this present time to speak of the ^^^tes of Jason / and will recompte and tell
in brief what ^d first in colchos / and by what manner and faco^n hi^ was
known that the rich moto^ or sheep with the flees of gold was there and also
the two meruaillous and terrible booles and the great ^poue^table dragon^
Then^e for to come unto this history I have fou^de^ an old auncien cronicle
conteynyng / that wh^lom^e was a king in athenes named jupiter / but this was
not that jupit that was sone of saturn that reigned in Crete. wh^^ is a much
noble country

^g of Athe^d (...) / the first was na^a^^o^ / that is a^^o^he as ^s in latyn^:
which by the athenyens was called god of ^atayll. for cause of many bataille
^at he had in his time against his ^^^ghbours / of which he had ^ay the victory
The second^ was apis which was king of argis^^ appollo that reigned in archade
was the third This appollo was a man of great government / he introduysed the
archadyens for to live honestly

Certe he ^querd many royauines he had great no^bre of children^ / And fynably
when they were growe^ to age. he deliuerid to the^ his lands to govern. and
after that departed right secretly from archade. and in the aslate of a
medicine or a phisicien he went in the most part of the prouices of the world
/ he was thus wandering ten years. and at the^de of te^ year he arrived at
athenes / And there found that this brother Mars was newly deed and passed out
of this world. and that there was made to him a temple / which endured after
unto the time of the conversion of saint denis. He went into the temple with
an heart replenisshid with teres / and knelid doun^ to the earth to fore the
representacion of his brother the god mars: requiring hi that he would she we to
him that thing that was best for him to do / and that he would with all his
might ensiewe and acco^plisse his doctrine and comma^deme^t.

^non^ as appollo had finisshid his prayer. a great whirli^g or tourbillon of
wind came suddenly and flapped hi on the vysage where with he was astonyed that
he wist not what hit was / and being in this rauissheme^t him thought that the
god mars said to him. appollo appollo: thy prayers ben presented in the huen
to the gods / Thou have seen many meruailes of the world. but that is
nothing in regard of one that thou shall see / and it shall not mow be seyn but
by the. Then^e it pleseth us that thou go into pyre for to make an arc unto
the semblaunce and likeness of that arc that noe made some time for to save him
and his famyllie from the deluge: and flood: after that we will that thou do
charge hit with as great a no^bre of pyrriens as hit may receive / and that
thou and they put you to the sea therein / and when ye have doun^ so. j shall
bring you in to the best isle the most rich and the most fertyle of all the
world: which shall been habited by the pyrriens: And thou shall understand
that by this isle / is a resort of the sea unto an other litell jle where in is
the noble moto^or sheep / with the fsiese of gold. the which not long syn was
sent by the gods Juno. to ^rixus / and to his suster Helles / both
enchassed bitheir stepmod for to make the^ pass the sea. which that now is
named hellespo^t: by cause that helles let her fall into the sea. The noble
and rich moton^ then^e or sheep of gold is the most meruaillous best / that
ever was i^ the world. and hit must be ones conquered but that shall be with
great parell and well behooves thereto a meruaillous craft and mistere: And for
somoche then^e as thou shall be i^ the isle habitable i^ the which j shall
conduyte and bring the beware and keep the also dear as thou have thy life: that
thou goo not into the isle. where the noble moton^ of goolde is in: For I have
therein ordeyend three bestes. the which ^t space of time shall cast fire flabe
fumyer and venyn out of their throtes whereof shall be destroyed al they that shall
desce^de in that isle. except only one unto a certain term. with these words
appollo came again to him self and thi^ki^g on the voys that he had herd after
that he had made his oblacio^s. he deperted out of the temple and also from
athenes. and obeing to the will of the god mars he trauayled in such wise by
his iournees that he ca^ unto the Royaume of pirre / in the cite of salathie /
that whilom had founded salathyel: which was of the lignye of the hebrews /
Then^e appollo logged him in the hows of a bourgoys named loath / and required
himoche that he would bring him unto the king of that country / which was
callid Phylitenus: Then^e loath accorded unto the request of Appollo / and
brought him to fore phylitenus. and then^e appollo made him the reverence. and
syn said unto the king in this manner.

Right excellent sire I am comen unto you not only by my pour vo^ente and
auctorite. but come in taccomplisshing the conma^deme^t of the god mars / god
of batailles. the which has chose^ me for to led^ certain nombre of they
people into the best isle of the world: and for thacco^plisshe the saint he has
^ma^ded the that thou do make for me an arc in such wise as I shall deuyse /
And after that thou deliuere to me. iij. honderd of thy men^ / with their wives
and children / the which shall enter i^to the arc with me. and then^e wha^ all this shall be done. the god mars by his g^ce shall brigevs unto the isle for said.
first te^habite and peuple the said isle. and above that for to show unto men^
meruaillous works that be^ there: and to the^de that thou ne think that j be
any deceiuor or abuser j oblige me to dye myserably in caas that j be found in
any fault proceeding fro my party.

Wha^ the king phylitenus had herd appollo and that he had beholdeu that he
was of hononrable maitiene / he d^e we him apart and co^iured hi^ that he
should declare what he was and of what life / but incontinent when the king
co^iured hi^ he began a lytil to wexe ashamed not withstonding he affermed to
hi^ that he was king of archade and sone of jupiter first king of Athenes and
brother unto god mars And. after he declared how he had left his royaume / and
how he had wa^dred in the world: and how the god Mars was in the temple and
apperid to him: and somoche said to him. that the king juged him to be most
wise and most discrete man^ of the world. and after accorded to hi^ all that he
had demanded i^ the favor of the god mars For tabregge the matter appollo did
do make the arc in such wise as hi seemed best at the expe^sis of the king And*
inco^tine^t wha^ hit was al made ready and the king did do put there i^. iij.
C. men of his Royaume ^d as many women with two knights of his lignage. of
whom that one was named e^hius and that other ethephius / and made he^ promise
that they should hold the isle / where appollo should bring them to / of his
royame in souerainte / and when the piriene had put in the arc their
necessites for their vytailles and that they had taken leave of the king and his
lords. appollo shette the arc fasito. and then^e sodaily rose and was lift a
tempeste so terrible and so great / that the cords and cables that held the
arc unto the land brak. and then^e it happe^d that the arc was with an
impetuous wawe tra^sported into the depnes of the sea

The king Appollo and all the Pyriens seeing so ^npetuouse te^ peste and
tormente supposed that the arc and all they that were therein: should have
periss^ed wherefore they began to cry and demene the gretteste sorrow of the
world and began to make great be waylinges and murmr upon Appollo but yet
that worse is / the tempeste continued more and more i^ such wise that it
seemed that inco^tine^t all the world should have fynysshed. Then^e the king
philitenus and his men being arenged upon the side / of the poorte* supposing
never more to have seen none of them being in the arc returned into their
houses be wayli^g them and weping bitterly. This tempeste dured thread days
hool. during which time the king Appollo conforted his men^ the best wise he
might / and promised the^ that with out fault they should be deliuerid from
this paritt And so hit happend the^ to be. for on the fourth day after their
departing from pyre the te^peste cessed. at the son rising And the noble
arcke was cast in a meruayllous. Regorte of the sea being by twene two ^les:
of which that one was great and that other loss

Incontine^t that the king appollo felt that the tempest of the sea c^ssed
litil and a litil: and after apperceyuid that the arc was a ground fast. and
the wind left his strong blowing: and on that other side the wawes were in
rest. he went up into the highest of the arc and opend a window for to be
hold and see where they were. and then^e he apperceyuid first the air well
attempryd and the son shynyng fair and clear. after he cast his sight
dounward. and then^e he saw the two noble jles. whereof the moreyle was next
unto the arc / which seemed to hiso fair and so delicious that he knew plainly
that it was the propreyle that was ^^ysed to him / And that other isle being
next that / was that isle that the habitacion was defended to him for the great
meruailles that there should fall And then^e he was so glad joyous and
reconforted / that he began to sing an hye tha^kinges and louinges unto the
god mars / and incontinent when he had so done he began to ka^le ^po^ the two
knights echius and zethephius And also his oste loath to whom he said that
they ought render and yield graces and tha^kinges unto the god of butailles.
And that they arrived into the land of pro^^is sion. Anon as these two noble
knights zechyus and ethephius and the other me^ and women vnderstoodd these
tydi^ges they rose upon her feet / made clean their vysages and clensid their
eyes of their teeris and wepi^ges looked up an high and required Appollo that he
would opene the doors and widows of the arc to the^de that they might see
that land of promissyo^ Appollo the noble king heerlg this request and
considering the right gretedisplaisir in which they had been / and the right
hye gladness that they had rec^^ured / opened all the entrees of the arc
and let goo out tho Pyryens she wyng to the^ the ferme land that they had
founde^ Which they found so noble. so dilectable and so fertile in all goods
that them iemed that they were in a very paradys / For the land was right
fertile / the pastures. and the herbs sweet ^melling / the trees charged with
fruit / the wodes and hye forestes full of wild bestes and veneson^ / wha^
Appollo had visited this noble land and had well comprised and ^siderid the
circuit and the places of the same. he founded in a forest an a water in the
name of god Mars. and did to hi sacrifice / And in the same place the
amozon^es founded after a ^^ple unto the goddess deane. In which jason and
Medea saw each other first and acqueynted the^ as if shall be said here after
and declared more a long in his place

After the foundation of this awter when the sacrefice was done. Appollo did
do call the. ij. knights zechius and zethephius and also loath with the people
that he had brought / and demanded them what they would do and what was
their entencion / And then^e they a^suerde as with one vois Certes our
entencion and will is to abide here and ly^e and dye: we desire never to
depart: for this shall be the sepulture of all us and of our eyres unto the end
of the world / the honye that here habon^deth shall be our mete: and we shall
labor and cultyue the earth with good vygnes* we shall enhabite with people
the low montaignes and the territoires: and thus we shall live in hye felicite
if it be your plaisir / If it be my plaisir a^suerde Appollo / if it had not be
only for to have distribued this so noble a land know ye for certain that i^
had not abandon^ed my self to the tempests and parils of the sea. ne to the
great orages and tourbillouns of the impetuose winds. hit plesets* me right
well that this noble country be your habitacio^. but syn your ente^cio^ is
such. it ^^ above all things necessary greatly for your well and
recom^endacio^. that ye re^dre and do your pain to edeffye a cite / and that
ye close hit with wall^s tours and yates to the^de that none may come run
upon you pylle / rob ne trauaille you in other manner / and after hit behooves
for to co^^ynny que to geder by good policy in such faco^n that the hardy
and puissaunt of body and courage / habille the^ with arms for to resist the^
terpryses of your enemies if any come for to grieve yo w The sage and wise men
shall enduce and teache the rude people and hard of e^tenteme^t: The pour shall
be holden and bounde^ the labor each man after his degree and calling / And
the most subtle shall devise thing propices for you as toures har^ois and
other habyllement seruyng to keep you in time of doubt. and with this they
shall ordeyne solemn edyfices and houses for the cite ^ the place thereto most
propice and couenable

When the pyriens had understand Appollo / all they ansuerde freely / that
they would acco^plisshe to their power: all that he would connceyle them. and
that he should be their fader and they his childreen^: Then^e they chose a place
couenable to bilde their cite / and tarried not long after but that they began
to vylde and house a long by the sea side / in such wise that by space of time
they founded and bilded a right noble cite and closed it with walls dichis and
yates / Appollo named this cite Iacoynte. The pyriens edified in the mids
thereof a much sumptuous palace. And on that other side Zechius and ethephius
and loath made also many houses and by space of time their generacio^ multiplied
greatly and meruaillously. Whereof Appollo thanked the god mars and did to him
sacrefice. This don: he assembled on a day all the people and said to hem in
this manner to fore he^ all.

People of god Mars when I ^sidere the well and the valor of your habitacion:
ye be^ much holde^ to the gods: wherefore I pray you from hens forward that
ye serve hi with good heart: And after that I pray you that ye norisshe pees
and co^corde to geder. And that ye keep you from all dyuysion and ra^cour / and
I pray you to vanisshe from your corages pride hate couetise glouton^ye and al
other vices. and consequently I cou^ceyle you. that at this time ye co^stitute
upon you iuges the two virtuous knights zechius and zethephius. and that ye to
the^ obey soueraynly: and if ye do these things. certaily all goods shall
habou^de ^ you: and if ye do not jdeclare to you for troth that i^ short time
in this cite shall not abide board ner hows sta^dlg ner one stone upon an other
/ appollo had not so sone finisshid thise words but that all they there
sto^dlg ope^d her mouths and cried w^ an hye voys sayng / Truly appollo thou
art the god of sapie^ce / as long ^s we live we will have none other juge but
the and to the we shall submytte us and all our affairs / and desiting thyn
holy sacrefices / manners and honest doctrines to ensiewe to our powers / we
will that thou be our pastor or herdman^ / and we shall be thy sheep

When Appoll^ had understand this that said is he a^swerde to hem and said.
Certes fair lords hit apperteyneth not to me to receive the great honor that
ye all offer and present to me / ye know how that zechius and zethephius ben
in your nation And I am here allone and a strauger: hit is among you euydent
and notoyre / that ye shall not take i^ patience my correction as ye should do
of zechyus and zethephius / And for sonioche I pray you that with so great
charge and burden yeleye not on my back. for hit is none need: and for to say
the verite zechius and zethephyus be^ two wise knights well attempred and
propice to excersite those dignytes / And therefore ye ought to receive them /
for certes ye be^ holden so to do. and theste your well shall follow and be
euydent / and ye so doing pees and love shall be roted in you. and there shall
be no man that shall be so hardy to conspyre any rumor Ra^cour Rebellion: ne
machine any trouble in no manner of the world / and sayng thise words all the
people began te murmr And echius and his fela we ^ethephius heri^g this
parliament to geder with loath. and som^e other principals then there that herd
/ ^siderid the people would in no wise break their oppimo^: concluded to make
an answer such as follows. which loath pronounced and^ said in this manner.

Appollo in no wise put no doubt in this work for so much as thou art among
us of unknown generation. Thy sapience and wysedom is more playsaunce to the
people. that the naissau^ce or birthe of zechius and of zethephius. Thou art the
right myrtour of our doctrine. the patron of our polycie. the right oustyll
that polisshith and enl^mineth us and our rude ingenyes. Certes the two good
knights zechius and etephius thank the of the right great honor that thou
do them And they being adjoined with the people will. that thou have upon us
and the Cite sonerayn seignourie / and therefore will thou no more seche weyes
so co^trepeysed: but enploye thy courage after the taste of our desires / for
hit is ordained and concluded that thou shall be our king And for to supporte
the shall be com^ysed echius and zethephius thy lieutenau^ts / the which by thy
introduction shall have charge and thought under the of the com^yn besines and
small things. of which they shall have the knowleche for to determine.
Incontinent as loath had finisshyd his proposycyon: at thinstau^ce of all the
people: Appollo accorded in all things unto their with* And then^e for^twith
two of the most grettest of the people took hi^ upon their sholdres and* cryyng
/ vine le roy appollo. which is asmoch to say as live the king appollo: they
bare him unto the palace / and there they set him in the trone of justice:
And zechius and zethephiu^ were set in an other siege more lower

What shall I make you long process. the one and other made there to the king
Appollo homage. And for to entretiene his as^ate / were ordained certain nombre
of people: And after this was ordained that there should be forgid money in the
cite. For the king Appollo enseigned the place in the isle where he had a right
good mine of gold: when all these things were thus ordained and concluded*
the people withdrewe he^ Every man into his place thanki^g the gods that
Appollo had agreed and accorded that thing that they somoche desired / that was
that he should abide there their king for to hold the^ in pees* reso^ and
justice. Then^e appollo as there souerayn abode and dwellid in the palace
accompanied of the. ij knights zechyus and zethephius and many other that he
withhelde i^ his service / and from that day forward appollo governed and
conduysed the people so wisely and discretly that by the space of xij. year. he
was merua^llou^^y belou^d of all his subgettis and also of the countrees by:
which had knowleche of him /

How the god mars sent to the king Appollo the manner how the moton^ or sheep of
gold might and ought be conquered


THe history that much is ancient Reherceth that at the end of these xij.
years / A terrible and great marvel apperid greatly in the lytil isle that was
there by: For there was see^ in many nights certain oxen or bulls of fire so
great. that they enflammed all the region of the air: And then^e that zechius
and zetephius and the people apperceyuyd all plainly this meruaylles / they came
on a night to the king Appollo and she wid him how the lytil isle was in a
terryble f^awme. And syn f^^de* to him that they would know what hi^ might
be: and that they supposed that there were men comen theder by som^e aue^ture /
Then^e Appollo answered to them in this manner. Certes fair lords j have told
you to fore this time / that in this isle the god Mars and the god of nature
shall do make appear the most great and the most terrible marvel of the
world. and yet I tell and say to you. that there is non^ other thinge^ but
the meruayles of the gods / and therefore be ye content and in pees / and
think no more thereof / and that ye keep you in o^y wise of the world that ye
goo not theder: for ^smoche as hit is straightly defend ^ / som^e there were
that were content with this answer. and so she not And among other zechius
said a hye and clearly that he believed hit not / and that on the morn^ he
would pass over in that isle for to know the troth with so great a company
that if there were any strangers he would put hem to death or in his mercy by
arms

The king Appollo understood not this answer of zechius / Wherefore he let him
speak what he would: and then^e zechius drew him aparte from thens right
secretly acco^panyed of xxx. men: which were all of one opinion: and concluded
among the^ that on the morn^ erly they should come to the port. and they
should go to this isle and deceive the king Appollo / This isle was of the faco^n
of a bird that men call in that country colcu: This night passed over. and on
the morn^ in the krekyng of the day zechyus and his xxx. felaws all armed and
well in point went to the zee. and began to row toward the isle of colchos. but
hit abode not long after that the king Appollo which was acustomed to rise by
times. ca^ to a widow of his palais and beheld toward the sea. And apperceyned
anon at the Ryue or see side many women and children. and also saw the ship
that zechius and his felawship led toward colchos / wherefore he wist not what
to think ner say and callid loath and his servants that were beholding upon
the watre Of whom he demanded curtoysly what they were that they beheld ^ the
ship. and wheder they ente^ded so hastily. and at whose commandment / Then^e
they answerde that it was zechyus and xxx. men armed and well in point in his
felawship. and that they had entencion for to goo i^to the isle of colchos for
to know the truth / whereof proceeded the great ^lam^es fumyers and vapors
that they had seen.

Wha^ the king Appollo understood these tydinges he lift his eyes on hye and
escryed and said. O god creator of all creatures what folly / and then^e
smote his breast with his fiste in sign of great a^gour / after he sent for
to seek zethephius and some maronners / and wha^ zethephius was come appollo
said to him Halas my dear brother if ever ye vil see zechius haste you / see
him there in a ship and xxx. young men with him: they be^ in entencyon for to
descend in Colchos as these women have certified me. And vrayli if they go
over far / they shall take harm / for they shall never return. and
therefore late us take a ship in all haste and late us row after them for to
retain the^ if hit be to us possible for to let and turn them from this
folisshe e^terprise: or ellis j suppose that shortly a great meschief shall
fall on them: ye in such wise that they all shall lose their (...) / In sayng
these words the king Appollo: zethephius the good hnyght / loath and their
people entered into the ship / that the maro^ners had made ready and towed with
all the haste they might after zechius and his felaws for to have retaynde
them / but all was for naught / For they could not so^ore haste them that they
could come so nygh: that they might speak to them And from far they saw them
enter into the peryllous isle. ye er they were half way thederward

When^e when appollo apperceyuid the great danger / where zechius and his
felawes had* put hem in against his will and leave / he was so angry that he
demened the most meraailloust sorrow of the world / hor he louid parfaytly
zechius: and in like wise zethephius and many other Yet al way he cessed not to
go forth and row til he came nyghe the isle upon a bow shot / and in
beholding he apperceyuid many bouffes of flambe and of a thyk fumyere or smoke
spri^ge into the air After this was not long after when he herd many pyetous
cries: one and other right ferdfull. and finably he apperceyuid one of the
felawship of zechius run out of this I Will as a man al despayred. The which
cryeng right horribly put hi^ self i^to the sea up to the neck Incontine^t
when appollo apperceyued and understood thise things: and among all other he
beheld him that was thu^ come and had put him in the sea / Certes he was sore
abasshid. but for to know all the ^^^^nges. be made to row ^er him / and
fo^de that the water where he was in. boylled by great hete al about hy^ body.
The pour felawe incontinent that he know the king appollo. began passing
pi^tous^y to escrye upon* him weping and sayng. Ha a sire appollo if hit be
possible to the / help and deliuere me from this mortal danger: Wha^ appollo
saw the pour felaw in such desolacio^ the teeris fill doun^ from his eyes.
and for asmoche as the water boilled so about him he had great pity / and
demanded of him what eyled him so to cry and weep. and from whe^s that water
came that so boilled about him: and axid syn where was zechius / Alas a^swerde
the pour felawe which labo^rid living there to the death in a dolor and pain
inestimable: Pray ye sire for zechius and for his felaws. For I have see^ all
one after an other dye in a mortell dis^resse. and so anguyss^ous^y. that
uneath that is creature living that could ve^ayly acompte and tell hit to you

THan appollo herd speak of the death of zechius and his felaws. he was so
sorofull / that he wist not what to do / but a^swerde to the pour felaw and
said by great admiracio^. how may that be fair sire. for j saw right now
zechius and all his felaws that were with hi^ wha^ they took lord i^ colchos
in descendyng from the ship. al^s ^ere sire answerde the felawe / hit is well
Reason that j recompte and tell yon the troth and verite of the manner of this
cruel adventure. Certes sire hit is very troth that incontinent that zechius
and we other entrid into they will. we apperceyuyd from far in a passing fair
medowe a living best fedyng all offyn goolde: And was as great as an horse of
the faco^n and form of a sheep or moto^: Then^e we concluded to geder with
one will that we would have taken hi^. and then^e we went forth and supposed
to have taken hit by force or other wise And for to so do we marched thedward
to our evil health / for anon^ after and right suddenly sprang out of a
temple the most fair and the most rich that I ever saw: a much meruayllous
dragon^ and ferdfull with three tongues casting fire and flambe with smoke out of
his throat. and fortwith incontinent sprang also out of hooles in the earth two
much horrible booles having legs and feet all of coper / their horns were
great and sharp. their eye^ gretter and more reed tha^ boylli^g coper or metal:
the which three bestes so dredefull disgorged and cast out fire of their
throtes and venyn upon us in such faco^n. that Zechius and all the other
deyde there in such payn^ and dolor that was never like thereto recorded / and
of us xxx. felaws there is none escaped except my self: which was last and
ferthest behi^de. for wha^ j apperceyuyd themes chief so great spntme to f^ight
/ but I could not so fast fsee: but that the terrible dragon^ cast upon me a
gobet of the most detestable infectio^ / that ever was. the which does me
somoche payn^ and meschief: and holds me in such a brennyng in all my body
/ that j must needs take by dolonrouse death the e^de of this world / wherefore
j require you that ye goo no ner Colchos.

With this words the dolorous man finysshed his days in anguisthe and pain /
and the soul deperted from the bodi in the psece of appollo: the which for
this cause demened the grettest and most terrible sorou that might be. and with
that roose the wind by great sudden pyries that came from the west / which
tormented the sea and meuyd hit meruaillous^y / and after this apperid in the
air great lightni^ges of fire: the which ca^ lau^chi^g bitwene the king
appollo and ethe phius and the other be^g i^ the ship. and there was non^ of
the^ so assured but with the wi^de. and the i^petuouse lightnyng they were
bete^ down unto the boto^ of the ship: and in such wise they were sineton^
with the lightni^g and tournie^s and with the orage of haylle stones: that
appollo hi^ self knew not a great while if ever he should escape this danger
or no For about he^ they saw no more / tha^ me^ do in a wi^tres night at
midnight wha^ hit rayneth Notwithstanding during this tempeste and derkenes the
good king appollo herd a voys said to him ^ this manner not aloude: But with a
moderat voys in such wise as sum well understood hit.

Appollo the god Mars com^andet^ the that thou return incoutine^t to thy
cite: for zechius thy good friend is deed by his great oultrage in this
perilous isle / and his felaws i^ like wise as it hat^ be^ late us declared /
also all they that fro hens fort^ put he^ or descend in to this isle / for to
seche ane^ture or other wise shall never return again: for asmoch as the gods
will not that it be enhabited unto the time / that a knight sha^ desce^de therein
which shall co^quere the noble moton or sheep of goolde by the mien of them that
shall come of thy seed. to whom thou shall leave a bille wreton wit^ the hand
of the god mars. the which is now under thy head. and teyneth from point to
poi^t all the mysteries and craft that he behouet^ to observe and keep for to
obtain and come to thing of so hye reco^me^dacion that like thereto hat^ ben ne
never shall be in the world unto the ti / me that the holy and new law shall
come: and after that time long after / the mystery of the f^ees of gold shall
hyely be celebrerd and hallowed

With this the vois was still / and appollo on this that he had herd began to
rise abasshid and esmayed of this work / And found under his head the bille a
fore said which he kept ^oygneus^y and aft he and his felawship returned unto
the cite. for the time and the great storm was incontinent gon^ and driven
away in the air and vanisshed, and then^e as soon as he and his people were
arrived at the poort and out of the ship / forth^ with the weder began to
change and began to snow. to rain. to blow and make one so terrible a
storm and te^peste / that by force of the out ragyous orage / the arc in the*
which appollo and all his co^pani^ came into that isle that they inhabited: and
also all the shippis and other boots that they had made / meuyd the^ to geder ^
such wise that the cables and cords that held the^ al to the port al to
brak. and the said vaissels and ships were blown unto the perilous isle of
colchos by so marvelous a furour that they were al to smyten in pieces and
broken in such manner that the bordes of the boots and other pieces without
no^bre f^oted here and there in the sea: and thus by this way. they were all
lost and spent / of the which aue^ture all they that were then^ at the port
beholdi^g were sore esbayed and not without cause for never to fore was see^ so
meruaillous a te^peste / and thought well that it went not well: and said one
to that other: that their gods were angry wit^ them wha^ such tempest ca^ to
the^ there to their great dom^age and prejudice

How the knight zethephius conspired against Appollo the king. and how they had
bataille to geder


AFter this evil aue^ture the king Appollo and they that were with hi^ returned
unto the palace enclynyng their heedes a doun^ and shew^g that anoye had
enterprysed the^ when they were come to the palace all they bewaylid zechius.
and dur^g this sorrow / the wife of zechius named Mena came thither for to here
tidings of her husbonde. and hit was said to her that he was left deed in the
isle of colchos wherefore she demened so meruayllous sorrow: that she fylle to the
earth al in a spasme and a swou^^e / and after came to her self. and then^e she
rent of her attire and drew her here out of her head by much aspre anger and
sorrow: in such a faco^n that forth with she was delivered of a child /
which she had conceyuid of her lord and husbonde / the which deyde as soon as
it was born^. for it had not his fulle time. for the death of which child the
anger and sorrow was much the more. Appollo then^e wenyng to conforte her / did
all that he could. but ye halpe not ner profyted no thing and made her to be
brought in to his house for the better to make her wepinges and lamentacions. at
her will And there was none that might comfort her / The women / the king and
fre^des of them that were deed with zechius semblably made great sorrow / during
which sorrow. Appollo* visited oftetymes Mena. and found that she had
co^tynuelly the teeris in her eyes / hou well she was a much fair lady: By
haunting from day to day / appollo knew the great and good love that she had
to her husbo^ / de / and that in no manner might forgete him: began to wexe
amerous of the lady i^ so much that he required her to be his wife: and she
agreed and acorded thereto i^ such wise that the one espoused that other / and
engendryd on her a daughter. the which was borne in good term. and was named
fanoles.

Among all other things zethephius began to have envye upon the king appollo.
for asmoch as his glory encresid dayli more and more: This miserable envy
encresid in his courage / and him seemed that if of appollo and of mena came a
sone / that sone should succeed to the royaume after Appollo / for which cause
he employed him self with all his power to conplaire and plese apertye of the
cytezeyns. and when he felt him in their grace: he assembled he^ on a day in
his house and said to the^ in this manner My brethren and good fre^des ye know
well that I am of your lignage / and that all my life j have co^uersed louyngly
among you / and in like wise mine au^cetres with youres have had always entier
aliaunce. this considerid my heart iuget^ that ye owe me good will and desire
mine encrees and honor And for somoche as you power is right great in this
cite. I pray^ and require you if hit so hap that appollo go fro life to death
that ye will have my sone for reco^ma^ded and that he may be king after hi^ as
ye know well that he^s thereto worthy

The friends of zethephius hering these words. all accorded with good heart
to do for hi^ all that they might / Then^e zethephius promised to them many
great things in cans they would make Feris his sone ki^d. and promised so
much good that they conspired the death of the king appollo / And in deed they
made covenant that they should s^ee hi^ if they found him at their aua^tage

After this coniuroyson^ then^e that these miserable and peruers traitres were
withdrawn in to their howses / They co^mened with their neighbors of the death
of the king appollo and promised the^ great no^bre of money if they might come
and obtain their intent: some there were covetous desiri^g their singular
prouffit accorded unto this sedicio^ / but also some there were that i^ no wise
would conse^te thereto / but allowed the great preudho^^ie and wisedo^ of Appollo.
and showed well that they* had hi^ better i^ g^ce* tha^ zethe^ius. Thus among
the^ began to meue and rise many ra^cours discordes and debats and this rumor
roos i^ so hye t^es and so plainly / that zethephius and his co^plices
counertiy murdered many of the^ that would not accord unto their tray son^ /
and somoch multiplied these oultragious syu^es: that wha^ some of the well
willars of the king appollo saw their felawesmurdrid / they drew to the king
appollo and told to him the machinaco^n of zethephyus and the oultragyons
sins that his felawes did: and required him much that he would take heed
and entende to their fayte / and to find such reinedie to keep his life well.
and honor and the proufryt of the co^yn well

The king Appollo was meruayllonssy troubled and had great sorrow i^ his courage
wha^ he was aduerrised of these hard tydinges / how well he ^duysed him right
wisely: for with all diligence he did take enformacio of these things. and
found that they had said to him the verite and troth and that zethephius
seduysed the people against him by tyranny al euydente and that co^tynuelly he
had in his house an. C. men^ of evil life. the which co^mysed all the evil they
could think upon them / that they found not of their ve^de: the great trouble
and displai sir of king Appollo doubled then^e: when he knew for troth that
it was true that he was advertised of Notwithstanding he endured the malice of
zethephius and his complyces acertayn space. but when he apperceyued their
conduyte / and that fro day to day they apayred more then^e amended / he sent
to z^^ephius that he should do iu^^^ce of his servants and such as were
culpable of the death the which tyrannysed in the cite. and if he would not /
he would seche remedy him self

When zethephyus understood the message of the king Appollo. he answerde to him
wit a mou^th full of felo^nye. that he was wise enough for to correct his
servants: and that he would not do but at his plaisir / and tha^ the messager
ca^ and reported this answer to the king appollo. the which he herd. Appollo
deliberid in hi self that he would suffer alytil for to see hou his enemies
would mayntene hem / during which time he beheld him welassurid in his palais.
bu^*hit was notlo^g after but zc^hephyus and his folk co^mysed more oultrages
and cruelte thene they did to fore. in somoche that all the people roos and
meuid on a day / And there were sum that came under appollo. and the other
went to the traytres: the which assemblid in this manner by great pride that
surmon^ted on the^ and sent to appollo that he should prestly depart out of
the palace and goo his way out of the cite. or ellis they would well that he
knew that they were his mortell enemies. Anon as appollo had received this
ma^dement he understood well that the thing was in evil term if he put not
payn^ to subdue and put under these traytres by artned wherefore he callid the
people the^ that were of his party and said to the / Fair sirs ye know well
ynow: ye have me constitued king above you / how well methi^keth zethephius
would take from me this dignyte / and of fayte he is declared mine enemy / what
is to be do^ her to: They answered / Thou art our king: other king than the we
will not have during our life / and for so much as every king is bounde^ to
keep and deffende his people / And semblably ben all people bounden to expose
body and goods for their king Hit seems us expedient that without longer,
tarye^g we ought to goo and assail thynenemye and. ours. to the end to
punysshe him* and his accomplices

When Appollo had understand this that said is. he accorded to the same
lightly / and put him anon to arms. And so did all they of his party.
and as soon as they were all in ^^olt. they went on the way toward the market
place / and therecome^ the king synt one of his knights unto Zethephius to
signyfye to him that he should come to appollo for to amend his meffaytes of
which he and his accomplices were charged with. then^e zethephius answerde that
he would go unto his enemy but that shall be said with strength of men of arms:
so puyssaunt and strong. that hit had be^ better for him that he had never
set foot in this country. and say to hi hardily: that if he be well
cou^ceylled that he and his well willare be not ^^den to fore my stre^gthe. but
that the^ goo so far that of them we here never after tydi^ges As Soon as the
knight had understand this that said is heretorned unto hislorde and recou^ted
to him what he had exploited. And zethephius without le^ger taryeng marched
forth aco^panyed of his co^plices all armed to the place where he supposed to
fide appollo / as he that was advertised of the^terpryse of the king / and went
so fer forth that they found their aduersaires: the which were so esmeuyd
upon them / that incontyne^t that they had espied each other / they escryed
them to the death. and ran upon each other armed one with an basenet en the head
/ an other armed the body. one bering a clubbe. an other aswerde evil
fourbousshed. and without other parliament holding they began a bataylle upon
the market felonnous and hgrd meruaillousty. jn casting terrible cries. one an
other as it had be^ thondre come^ doun^ from hene^. and with this all the
women and lytil children of the cite ca^ rennyng and cried weping so right
anguisshoussy that hit was great pity to sec hem make their bewailinges and
sorrow.

Thus as ye may understand began the bataille of the Cytezeyns the one against
that other / and. in the coming to gyder they smote each other cruelly /
without having regard sauf only to ssee each other but the king appollo ^^^
theris and loath put hem forth among their enemies so ferrelin gyuing pesaunt
strokes and terrible on the right side and on the lift side by such virtue that
the place was anon^ dyed and weet with the blood of the malefac tours. and they
did so knyghtly and cheualeroussy / and in especial Appollo. that there was no
tray tree but that he tremblid to fore he^. And every man began to make place to
the noble king The^e zethephius had such sorrow. that he came and put him tofore
the berde of the knight Fletheris and of loath. and he had with him x. of* his
best fightars: and such was their aue^ture. that with one stroke the ge^til
knight fle theris sinote donn zethe phius to the earth among the deed bodies
and took him / And in this hete appollo and loath fought so sore with the other
a^nd so eygrely that they sle we the most part. And hit was not long after
that the traitors knew that their captain was sore hurt and taken.
wherefore they turned their back and put the^ in fsyght. in all parties
along by the ^yue of the cite / and so sparklid a broad

How the king appollo gaf to his daughter the bille and manner for to co^quere
the ^noton^ or sheep of gold / which came after to medea:
When the gentil king appollo saw that his mortal enemy was holde^ and that
his co^plices put them to fiyght / incontine^t cessed the bataylle / and
returned to his palace with great glory. and each man cried Health be given
to the king appollo / Many of the principal of the people came then^e to fore
the king and would there have ssaynthe vntre we zetpephius / But zethephius
required them hu^bli mercy and co^fessid his great fault / and there with ca^
there his wife that knelid to the earth tofore the nobles and the people: and
required them of grace for her husbond so humbly that the king had pytie of her
/ and saved zethephius life. But that same day he accused all them that had
com^ysed the great evil: of whom the king Appollo did do justice / And after
this gaf to Fletheris the office of zethephius. and from this day forthward the
cite was nourisshid in pees the space of many years to the loving and preysing
of Appollo.

Zethephius dismyssed of his office as said is: attemprid his courage and
governed him so well and discretly / that he recouurid the love and good grace
of the king / ye in such wise that by the meue of Mena / the king appollo gaf
in marriage his daughter Phauoles: unto the sone of Zethephius which was named
Pherys / This Pheris was a wise young man: prudent / discrete / attempryd and
much lou^d the gods: all virtues and good justice: wha^ they (...)
com^^rsed with him a certain (...) considerid two things / the preudo^iye and
wysedo^ of pheris was that one. And that other was that he would return in to
greece. he co^stitued in this royaume pheris king. and the people confermed him:
And hit was not long after that Menadeperted fro the life bideth. whereof appollo
made meruaillous sorrow: And then^e when he had long wept the death of his wife:
and felt his end to approach / he called on an even his daughter phauoles and
said to her My dear donghter I take leave of the For I must secretly depart
from this country / and allone return into greece where j was born^. how well
first er j depart I late the Queen of this isle. whereof I have in mine heart
great joy. And for as mocheas I know thy wit thy discresion and thy vtues /
j shall deliuere to the. the bylle that the god Mars has wreton^ ^teynyng all
the manner how oon shall do for to co^quere the noble moton^ or sheep of gold
in the isle of colchos. and for to destroy all the terrible bestes that been in
the same isle. And I com^ande that to no man living ne to no creature of the
world thou show hit not / But if hit be in the end of thy life unto a
doughther that shall come of the: unto whom thou shall make her swear that
semblably she shall not she we hitto nopersone sauf only to her daughter And so
from daughter to daughter. Hit plesen^ the god Mars / that this bille be kept
upon pain of death unto the time that out of greece shall come a knight into
this palace that shall be worthy to see it / And shall conquer the noble
moton^or sheep of gold

With these words the king deliuerid the bille to his dear daughter: the
which contained in substance the terms rhat follow / If thou love thy life and
wilt adventure they self. for to conquer the moton^ orshepe of gold / hit is
of pur necessite that thou have the habytes that appollo was clad with all at
the our that this bille was deliuerid to him / after hit behooves that thou
have his armures and that thou were his gown above them / and of the other
clothes thou make sacrefice unto the god Mars. and put there with a bole whereof
thou shall keep the blood: After this thou shall take the powldre of the
sacrefice. and put hit in three parties / that is to wete one with the blod of
the bole. and this myxtion^ have such virtue / that if thy body be anointed
there with the fire. ne the venyn^ of the dragon^ and of the two meruayllous
booles that keep the moton^ may not noye the / Unto the regard of the second
perte of this poulder thou shall meddle hit with glue. and with this glue thou
shall enoynte the mosels of thise two meruayllous booles. to who^ thou may
then^e seurely approach notwithstanding that they cast fire against the
dismesurably / but when their mosels ben englued they may then^e cast no more
fire ne venyn / Then^e thou shall go to the dragon^ / whom thou must s^ee
bythy strength and by thy hardynesse: ad then^e when thou shall have slain hi
thou shall return to the two booles and hyde their eyes. And thou shall yoke
hem and make he^ to turn four rood of land: the which thou shlt sow with
the teth of the dragon^ / that the^e is ded And after thou shall make them to
harowe hit / And the^e suddenly shall grow of this earth many Geants armed /
which shall arise ayensi the. And when hit shall comen to s^^ytyng. cast upon
them the therde part of the pouldre And anon they shall fight to gyder. and
each of them shall s^ee that other. and then^e when thou shall have do^ all
this that said is. tha^e thou may take the noble moto^ or sheep of gold and
conquer hit. and then^ thou shall flee him / and with the body reserved the
vliese of gold thou shall make sacrefice to the god mars knelyng and humylieng
thy self ^o fore him thou shall say thisoroyso^ that follows.

Mars my god that by the sufsrau^ce of the God of nature have puissau^ce for to
change the nature of bestes And that by thy propre virtue conduytest all
batailles and bring the^ to thy playsire. I thank the with all my heart of
that thou have made me to do: And pray the humbly that thou receive my
sacrefice i^ gree And that thou will conduyte me with mine honor and bring me
unto my country. And thus when thou have fynisshid thy prayer. thou may
return with glory into thy country and be seized with the noble f^yese of
gold.

MY dear daughter said then^e appollo lo here the writing that I have spoken of
/ And after that lo here mine habytes that be requysyte for to obteyue the
conquest of the sheep of gold / and mine armures ben in the temple of god Mars:
and there shall abide unto the time that this noble conqueste shall be do^. And
therefore keep the^ well / and soyngneus^y that no danger come to you. and that
I charge the by the commandment of the gods. And I pray you for all the
plaisir that ye may do to me that no person be advertised of my departing:
Then^e Phanoles promised and swear to her fader that she should do to her power
all that he had required her and charged her with. and then^ they took leave
each of other weeping right tenderly. and syn went Phanoles with the king
Pherix: For hit was night: and the good ancient king appollo abode in his
chamber unto on the morn erly. and then^ he departed secretly al allone and
entrid into a litil boot al propice which he had do make tha^e he reco^ma^ded
him in the guard and keeping of the gods / And then^e a wide smote on the ship
that brought him upon the deep see / and ye shall understand / that the same
day the king Pherix was well adnertised / that his fader in law was goon^ and
deperted he began to demene and make a meruaillous sorrow: and so did all the
people: but wha^ they saw that they could not have him again ner recouure him
They commanded him to the guard of the god mars / Then^e the king Pherix began
to have the gouuernaunce of the royaume / and conduysed it in such wise that in
short time he gate the love of all the people and of the nobles of the royaume

The king pherix then^e after the departing of the old king Appollo had of his
wife phauoles a daughter named Ortis: This donghter came to age and was married
unto a noble man of greece named Oetes / the which by fortune of the sea was
brought into this country / in the time that the king Pherix was i^ his old
and au^cie^t days: the ladies of Sychye came then^e into this march* and well
supposed to have gotten and taken this cite of Iaconyte by assault. But the
inhabita^tes of the cite bare he^ so strongly that this multitude of women were
constrained to cesse of their enterprise / whereof they had great sorrow and
as^ieged the cite And duri^g their siege they made the temple of the goddess
deane / of whom is spoken to fore. this temple ie like to an otherthat they
made in Ephese

During their siege Oethes which was strong and cheualrous and much vayllyant
in arms / and of great conduyte scarmusshed with hem many times to his houour
/ and did so much / that when he ladies had performed their temple / and that
they considered that the cite was imprenable by assault / and also that the
cytezeyns came not out against them in bataille. wherefore they lost their time:
they raised their siege and returned unto the isle of colchos but they so
adventured the^ returned never again. after the departing of this assemble of
ladies / the (...) Pherix gaf his daughter to Oetes: and made the^ to wedde
that one to that other ^ the temple of dyane which was meruayllous rich:
Then^e anon^ after pherix and phanoles deyde / and oetes was the third king of
this isle by the asse^te of all the people: This king Oetes found a mine of
gold. Whereof he did do make vaissell and other vte^silles necessary and
propice unto his household / this was the most rich king of all the world in
that time / he did do make an ydole al of fyn gold representing the god Mars.
and another representing the gods deane the which were in a wode ed^ffied of
gold / wherein he had all manner of wild bestes: After he did (...) a fair
gardyn of playsa^^ce. in which he founded a temple unto the gods venus /
unto whom he did do make a rich image: which was al of fyn gold And about
the same were fifti men^ and as many women that desired and required each other
of love / and they were made with so amerous manners. that al they that beheld
them / where lighlty and sone mouyd to luxure / Hit is not to be vnreme^brid
that among all these things, the said king Oethes had ^ daughter by his wife
Ortis / This dought grew and was named Medea and becam passing beauteuous and
fair yet he had an other doughtere by his wife and a sone / the daughter was
named Caliope / and the sone was named abserthius. At the burthe of this
Abserthius / the queen ortis was so seek that she leyde her doun^ in her mortal
bed / and called to her / her daughter Medea: and deliuerid to her all tho
things that the king appollo had deliuerid to his daughter Phauoles touching
the fayte of the conquest of the golden f^ese And also taught her many
enchantements: and with this she gaf to her a Ryng of gold: wherein was a sione
of such virtue / that hit should make them invisible that bare hit: and this
done / she passed out of this world / where fore Oetes Medea and caliopes
demened meruayllous great sorrow / and there j will rest of this sorrow and shall
recompte what was the end of the king Appollo.

How the king appollo arrived at the port of Starille / and how he departed
secretli fro the king Serath and arrived at they will of Colchos / and of his
death: and how the king Serath confessid Appollo to be a god.
WHa^ the king Appollo was allone on the sea as said is: he abandon^ed him unto
the fortune of the wyndes and of the waters / confyeng and trusting in the
grace of the gods. And his fortune was such / that he arrived at the port
of Starille a cite of the royaume of Pyre. and there fo^de that the king
Philitenus lay there passing seek. and then^e went to him / and after the
reuere^ces made. recounted to hi^ fro point to point all that was befallen to
him and his people / how that he had fond the isle that the gods had promised
to hi^ / and how they had made the cite / and how they had made him king / and
how zechius and his felaws deyde i^ the ^le of colchos / how zethephius had
conspired against hi^. how he had made his sone Pherix king. and how he was
departed the^s allone / The king philytenus (...) marvel of these things
(...) great chere to appollo after (...)* power. but anon after he deyde and
after hi^ succeeded i^ his royame a sone that he had which was named serath.
Tha^ wha^ appollo^ saw^ that Serat^y was obeyed king of pyrre. he came to hi^ on
adaye to take leave for to return into his country? but Serath would not that
he should depart And required him instantly that he would use the remenau^t of
his life with him. Appollo excused him and took leave yet ones: but in no wise
serath would accord thereto: and when appollo saw this and felt that he might
not long live / he departed the^s on an even so secretli that no man knew til
on the morn. and then^e on the morn^ they knew it by the report of one of his
knights / which certified him that he had met and recount^id him in a
place that he named

Incontinent that the king Serath understood these tidi^ges: he was sore
trobled. for he louid parfaitly appollo. and forthwith he took his horse and in
ente^cion to bring hi^ again / he rode after him acompanyed of. ij good
knights of his court / but he could never overtake him til that he was come
^to the isle of colchos where he found him passing seek and laboring in the
extreme draughtes of death / The anoye of king Serath redoubled wha^ he saw and
found appollo ^ this estate and wept. Then^e the king appollo defended him
that he should go no ferther i^to the isle of colchos for to conquer themoto^
or sheep of gold / and syn recom^anded hi^ to the gods. and that done
expired his life / for which death the king Serath and his knights were
terribly fory / and concluded that they would bear the body into their
country: and make for him a fair and rich sepulture. and tha^ they garnisshid
the body with great ^oison^ of candellis for to wake that night / but tha^ hit
was about midnight / and that all the luminaire bre^de about the body of
appollo: all went out and queuchid sod aynli / and tha^ must the king Serath
and his knights wake the remenau^t of the night without any light or clerenes
whereof they hadd great meru^^lle / And on the morn^ wha^ the da^e apperid it
happend that the^ ^^^nde not the body of king appollo: ^ut i^ the place where
they had le^^it the day to fore. they found an awter of cristall passing
clear. upon which was anymage of fyn gold so quykly made after the faco^n of
appollo. that it seemed proprely his person. Wherefore the king Serath seeing
this muracle. knelyd down on both his knees to the earth to f^^ehi^ and
worshipped it. And tha^ he herd a voys that said to him. Serath seek not
appollo but among the gods: he has praid for the and for all them that shall
come to his sepulcre. and therefore know thou that thou shall have good
fortune / and all they that shall come hither by good devotion shall have
answer of things that they shall dema^de / and here with the voys made
silence: and the king Serath confessyd then^e openly that without error.
appollo was a god. After these things he did do make in the honor of h^a
^e^ple en signefieng all that he had seen and herd to ben true. and fro thene
sorth on the greeks were acusiomed to come to this temple fro fer country to
worshipe him and diligently dema^de and enquire of their destinees / And among
all other Peleus went theder as ^ayd is And thus ends the history of
Appollo and his faytes And now j will return for to speak of the faytes and
vaillaunces of the noble and preu Jason / for that is our principal matere.

How the king Oete^ receyuid Jason into his his cite. And how Medealouyd Jason
/ and brought him to the temple of Venus / and how the old woman enchanted the
bed of Jason


When Jason was departed from Lennos. And that he had sacred his ship unto the
goddess pallas: and to the goddess of the sea. he sailed by many journees
from one coost to an other. that i^ the end Argos ruled so his course by the
son / that on a day he arrived in the isle that he had desired to find by a
great storm and impetuouse fortune that by force were constrained for to take
the regorte or goulf / where as the isle of colchos was by Hit was not long
after that when Argos had brought* his ship in this goulf or arm of the sea /
that the son went done. and then^e as argos thought where he might best
cast ancre / and make his ship fast / hit happend that he saw tofore him
the cite of Iacoynte. and on that one side of the isle of Colchos / there spra^g
out sodayuly tourbillou^s of fire so terrible that of feer that he had i^
beholding hit he began to cry. Wha^ Jason hercules and Theseus and the other
knights of greece herd the master thus cry. they sprang up and came to him /
and the master told the^ the cause of his cry. and syn showed to hem the cite
and the isle / and asseured hem how they were come^ to the end of their vyage and
of this matter they devised so long that speking thereof their ship ca^ to the
port into the^pre place where the arc of king Appollo was comen at that time
when they ca^ first into the land. Then^e the master of the ship cast his
ancres into the sea / Then^e Jason re^drid loving and preysing unto th^e gods
/ and so did hercules. Then^e they se^te Theseus unto the king Oetes for to
signefte to him their coming / and for tenquere if this was the country that
they sought. Certes Theseus went and did his message in such wise / that the
king Oetes presented to him his palais / and sent unto the noble Jason four
of his knights that required him on the kings behalue that he would take his
herberow in his palace / and he was to him right welcome: And when jason had
understand the will of the king by the iiij. knights: he promised the^ that
with a good will he would come theder / and then^e he entrid in to the cite /
which was noble and fair. and how well it was night at that time / yet was the
cite as light as it had been day by the clarte and resple^donr of torches.
cresettes and other fyres / that the king had do make in the cite right
notably acompanyed for to feste the greeks

Ye may well understand that the right noble Jason entrid into this cite /
acompanyed of Hercules and his felaws that were right rich clad and habilled
with cloth^ of goold and of silk / The street by which they passed for to go
to the palace was on two renges hye: and low peupled of ladies. of
damoiselles: of knights bourgeys. merchan^s: mayde^s and yo^g people beholdi^g
their coming and ordenan^ce. And when jason was come^ unto thentree of the
palace. he found there the noble king Oetes. which was set in astate royal
for to feste jason and his company / and receyuyd jason right honorably as
chief of them all. and the^e wha he had welcomed them. he took hi^ ^y the hand
ad leode him unto his pa lays And anon as they went upon the steyres for to
goo up jason looked into a window. and beholding he espied the fair Medea among
many ladies / to who^ he took no^ other head as for this time: but hit was not
so on her part: For she began to behold him so affect^o^s^y for his great
because. that he was more i^ her g^e than ^ can tell you. For ^^bregge the
matter jason and all his ^pa^ye passed forth by this window where Med^a was.
and came into an halle where the tables were couerd And tha^ why^es they made
ready the so^ per. the king Oetes began to demand the ge^til knight jason and
after many words he began to say to him i^ this manner

Iaso^ fair sire ^ know for troth that ye be sone of king Esoulyke as Theseus
your felaw has said to me But I know not whyther ye ente^de to goo / ne what
thing ye seche / wherefore ^ pray you by manner of a pass time that ye will a
lytyl reco^ / pte to me of yo^^ astate and enterprise / if hit be possible that
ye so do may ^ any manner / and I promise you that if I may be propice in any
saco^n for the love of your fader / who^ I have some time known I shall deliuere
to you aid comfort in all that ^ me shall be possible: Sire ansuerde then^e
jason ^ thank you hu^bli of the great honor that ye present to me: and syn
it must nede^ be that ones ye must know the cause wherefore ^ am descended into
your country / I declare to you that ^ have enterpsed for to goo into the isle
of Colcho^ notwithstanding the parils which be^ much to doubt and not with
out cause / and with this I have made a^owe that ^ shall never return into
greece / unto the time that I have conquerid and shalbrynge with me the sheep or
^^ese of gold. and if I may not make an end of this enterprise Hercules my
felawe shall adventure him. Werfore I require you that of this enterprise ye
will counceylle me to your power. Certes Jason said the^e the king ye have
made a little vow. How sire said Iaso^ how so / for asmoche a^s^erde the king
as by any adueture or fortune ye e^tre into this y^^ of colchos. hit is not
possible that ye ever return hither aga^ / for there be in that isle two great
and meruaillous bulls enueny^^ed com^ysed to the keeping of the moto^ or fsees
of gold / whereof ye spak: also there is co^mysed for the guard of the same the
most terryble and the most crimynel dragon that ever was spoken of or see^ The
which three bestescast continuelly ^ire ^ fenyn out of their throtes / which
shall ^^ee yo^ without remedy in / contin^t that ye approach them: the which
things consider^d syn that ye have demanded me co^ceyle. and also that e^yri
noble man is bou^de^ to give cou^ceyle to the^ that be^ euylen formed and
conceyled: I pray you / and cou^ceyle as my propre ^one that ye cesse of this
your enterprise. for if ye do other wise all the gold of the world may not
save you* and therefore the^^e well that ye have to do before ye put you in
such a dannger I co^ceylle you as thaugh ye were mine own sone or my brother
germayn. and herewith they left their words

The soupper was ready. with these words the king satte at the table between
jason and Hercules / and sent after Medea and Caliope: which were set to
fore him / this done he commanded the other greeks to sytte at an other table
where they were rychely seruid. But when hit came for to ete the noble maid
medea e^troubled at that time her mayntene / and cast her regard upon jaso^:
where she rested le^ger then^e hit apperteyned to her contenau^ce. for jason
seemed to her more fair tha^ he was at the first time. and he was so playsan^t
and agreeable that wha^ she herd reco^pte among other deuyses and things that
he was come^ for to conquer the moto^^or ^^ees of gold / she iuged that this
was the knight of greece which was destined for to conquer it. and said in her
self. that she would help him to obtain the same: with that he would take her
to his wife: such or ^^blable were the thoughts of the fair medea at souper
She beheld often times jason wha^ she saw her time. and it anoyed her much
that she might not speak to hi^ pryuely. What shall ^ say more for wha^ the
king and the greeks had right well take her refectio^ the tables were take up /
and after the greeks were brought into diverse cha^bres. and among all other
Jason was loged nigh by the fair medea / for there was no more between but a
lytil aleye from her chamber / to his by which jaso^ went afterward often times
unto medea. When then^e jason was withdrawe^ into his chamber. and that he was
allone with mopsius / he began to devise with him and sayd^ Mopsius fair sire.
what say ye of mine e^terpryse of Colchos: By my law sire said mopsius. I see
no way ne know none other thing but matere of dolor and sorrow: for every man
of this house iugeth you ded if ye go in this perilous isle of colchos. where
there be^ so dread full and terrible bestes as it has be^ said to you.
Notwithsta^di^g a^suerde jaso^ / it behooves that ^ ac^te mine auowe Certes sire
said mopsius hit is now no need for to go any further if it plese you and be
well ^ceiled ye ought to be co^te^t without going any ferther. for as it is said
co^mnnly. hit is better to leave folly: then^e to mayntene folly: Ha a fair
sire Mopsius fayde Jason: If ^ do not my power to par^or^^e that I have
promised and auowed I should use al my life after in reproach Certes yet had i^
lever finisshe my days honorably / And know ye verily that syn I am come
thus far abydyng the grace of the gods I shall parsorme mine enterprise and
shall abide the adventure. Sire said Mopsius ye shall do that ye good seem. but ye
understand not well your caas: for know ye that it is a certain that peleus
your uncle has sent you hither cautelously for to enterprise and achieue this
au^ture: to the end that he might obtain your Royaume / and therefore ye may
return from hens in to greece without more further enterprise. ye shall get
thereby no reproehe* but ye shall be holde^ for myse: for he is discrete that can
fse from his mysane^ture and keep him from dom^age

In verite Mopsius fair sire answerde thee^e jason / I ne may not adiouste
faith to all that ye have to me now said. And for so much know ye for certain
that for part^ of death. or danger that may befall and come to me / I shall not
deperte me but that I shall furnissh mine auowe. and therefore if it so happen that
I dye in this perilous isle / I require you to reco^ma^de me unto the good g^ce
of the fair Mirro. Wha^ Mopsins had understand that said is: he began sore to
weep / And jason leyde him doun^ in his bed / and syn^chau^ged purpoos and
began to deuyse of the good chiere that the king Oetes and Medea had made to
him In reco^manding above all other things the great beauty and the fair
contenau^ce of Meden. And in continuyng this purpos he fill a ssepe

The fair Medea was at this time at the door of the chamber of Jason / and
herd all* the deuyses of Jason and of mopsius. as she that was esprysed of
the love of the gentle prince of greece. that in no wise she might vaynquisshe
her courage / And also long as their devises dured. so long stood she at the
door herkenyng / And when they cessed their purpoos she returned into her
chamber. where was but one ancient lady her gardyen^e or maystresse which was
tho a ssepe. and then^e the noble maid Medea went and leyde her in her bed
full of thoughts and imaginacio^s. that wha^ she would have slepte she could
not. For asmoch as so many thoughts and ymaginacions assaylled her on all
parties by such faco^n. that she turned her often in yelding many asyghe /
and then^e by forse of a meruayllous enbrasing of love she began to say softly
to her self Alas mine eyes i^ what labor have ye put me. certes ye be the
cause and none other that I am not she that was wont to be. For ye have
enuoluped mine heart. with an ardant fire of amerous desire. Ha a what shall be
fall / or what shall j mow do being in this pain and sorrow. Certes I can
say no more but of verray necessite. j yield me all in the subjection of love
in his servitude shall j be subgette hit is force. and werfore for asmoch as j
am smyten^ to the heart with the great beauty of Jason the bruyt of all the
world: and to my judgment the glory of greece / O meruaillous dart where with
I feel me smyten^ to the heart. Certes mine eyes ye ben the cause which
displeseth me. And for what reso^ / for asmoche as ye be coulpable of this
folly. how be it / hit is no folly Hit is: j believe hit not: hit must be
beleuid: for hit is great folly to desire thing that can be goten^. j know
verayli that Jason is so more enamoured of a lady in his country / And
furthermore his courage is garnisshid of agrete and meruaillous constau^ce
Then^ may it be said that I may not enjoy him. and by co^seque^t I may
conclude that mine eye^ have e^clined and submised me unto an over great folly

Ha a mine eyen^ why replye not ye to this argument / see not ye that j do no
thing but think: for the ge^til and noble Jason the^keth no more on me. then^e
on her that he never saw Ha a in what jeopardye stand I in. For I may not
require jason of love / for that should redou^de in me great blame: and I should
go again the honor of love And then^ must hit needs be that I bleue in all
my folly / and also I must doubt hit for two reso^s The first is. for I should
be deffamed unto the end of the world If hit happend me to require this
knight of love And the second reason is all euydent / For Jason without
co^tradictyon goth into the isle of Colchos. there where he shall be anon^
deuowred of the terrible bestes Ha a what sorrow and dommage shall that be if
such a prince should perisshe by such manner / for he is the chose^ of all
nature / the choice of nobles / and the flour of worship. j have herd his
resons. he had lever dye honorably i^ acco^plisshi^g his auowe then^ to
return with rest to greece: ha a what noble and exelle^t courage / o how happy
and ewrous should j be and nygh to great felicite jf j might be callid by hi^
unto his love / that might he do ye as me thinks / and how: for to tech and
learn hi the jndustrie and admynistre to hi^ the manner for to conq^re the noble
fles of gold I have all things propices for to brige this conquest to an
end / jf I wyste that he would take me to his wife j should deliuere them to
him with the better will and gre of mine heart / what shall j do / Alas j wot
never / and ^f I did him this auau^ceme^t / and after set naught by me for
the love of his first lady in amors To who^ he reco^ma^ded hi^ by mopsius as j
right nou herd. certes j should dye for sorrow / and shall j late hi^ aue^ture
to furnissh his auowe / and then^ death shall follow. alas nay. for if he deide
there: my death were me right nygh: for asmoch then^ as I love hi bett^ then^ my
life. and my heart ^^^eth that this is he for whom the gods have establisshid
this meruaillous adventure in the isle of Colchos / And furthermore me seems
that if I do for him so great a thing / as for to save his life. and that by my
moyen he shall come to above of his enterprise honorably: that for the merit
and reward of my benefice / he shall be content and joyous to take me to his wife

MEdea the noble lady with this conclusion fill a sleep / and passid the night
til the day ca^ / and the king rose up more erly then^e he was wo^te to do for
to come to Jason. wenyng to let and break his enterprise. hou well he went
unto him when he knew that he was risen: And found Hercules with him. They
entresalewed each other. After they began to deuyse of the isle of Colchos. and
the king reherced of them that had been in colchos* and hou they had been slain
and devowred. and after this cou^ceylled Hercules and jason that they should in
no wise go theder / but what remonstrance he showed hem / jaso^ abood in his
purpoos for to take thadue^ture / and to put his body in Ieopardie among the
three terrible and crymynell bestes / and concluded that he would deperte
thederward with in four days following / When the good king apperceyuyd that
there was none other remedy. but that jaso^ was verily deliberyd and concluded
taccomplisshe his auowe upon the right meruaillous aue^ture of Colchos. he
deported hi self for speki^g more thereof. and cou^ceylled jason that for to
pass his time he should goo to the te^ ple of the goddess Deane / which the
ladies of Sychye had newly foun / ded in a forest called Edee. Jason thanked
him much of his good cou^ / seyl and said that he would go theder with good
heart. and tha^e he disposed him to go theder and sent for all the greeks of
his company: and took with him the representacion of the noble goddess
pallas: which was in his ship: aftre this he set forth his knights on the
way / and him self / bering the said representacion went after with them.
Hercules and theseus went beside the preu Jason. and had to fore hem trompettes
/ claryons tabours / and other instruments that made so ioious anoise and bruyt
/ that they of the Cite had marvel / and some there were that followed them For
among all other Medea and her suster and other ladies and damoyselles unto the
no^bre of iij. C. followed and hasted hem so sore. that they were at the temple
to fore the greeks

When jason was come to this temple medea came and met with him by the
incytacyon and admonessheme^t of love / and entresalewed each other curtoissy /
and there were many of the greeks that beheld medea in maki^g their prayers.
Always jason that thought on nothing but on his deuocions eutrid into the
temple: and set the rep^sentacio^ of the gods pallas: by and nygh the
gods deane / and wha^ he had so don he cast hi self dou^ on both his knees
to fore the awter. and there was so long in prayers and oroiso^s that the fair
medea was sore greuid and anoyed. for she desired sore to speak with him / and
was i^ al determined for to save to him his life in p^seruyng him from the fire
and venyn that the. iij. meruaillous bestes cast and rendrid

At the last jaso^ arose from his prayers: and came to the ladies / to whom he
made reverence and principally to medea: the which aroos against hi / whom the
ladies and damoy felles beheld much ente^tif^. after she took him by the hand
and led him and shewid him all the places of the temple / and among al other
she shewid him there the rep^sentacio^ of the god mars wenyng for to speak to
him of certain things / the which she desired sore to know the troth But
hercules and theseus and other of the greeks ladies and damoiselles followed so
nygh that she wist not^ou thaco^plisshe her ente^cio^ / how well that she lad
him long. and wha^ she saw that she might not have her intent there: she said
to hercules that she would bring the^ into the temple of Venus. Then^e the preu
jason and Hercules thanked the noble lady of her courtosye: and departed from
the temple of deane for to go to the temple of Venus. but in going mede^ began
to sighe as she that had therte ^flam^ed of a meruaillouse ardeur and
bren^yng. then^e wha^ she could not hyde that (...) her heart / by force she
entemed ^ (...) to opene her matter i^ this wy^ Certes right noble knight j
(...) much your great beauty / wherefore inada^ne ansuerd Jason / for asmoch
said she as I have understand that non^ may break ne torn you fro
the^terprise that ye have taken but that ye will aue^ture you in the conquest of
the flces or sheep of gold / which is a thing impossible to any man living
and know ye for certain that if ye go theder: ye shall never return / and for
as much as ye be comen of so noble extraction of ryal lygnage: and that it is
so that every like loves his semblable / by this very and naturel resou I
complain you above all other / me thinks that ye be meruaillonssy abused.
for to so will lose your life. certes I hane not herd of a gretter simplenes.
for naturelly euyri creature flees the death and desires to live / it has well
ben declared and advertised to you of the parils that be^ in this aue^ture and
that for to bring to effect / ye shall lose your life: and yet always ye wole not
believe cou^ceyll / Certes jason it is evil done / and ye do against nature
wha^ ye be cause of your death which every man ought to flee soueraynly Wha^
jason had understand this that said is. he a^swerde to the noble lady in this
manner. Ha a fair madame j have right well vndstande your words and reso^s which
^^n good and holsos^e / but ye compte not that evyri noble bodi ought so^^er
chese the death: the^^e to do or conse^te thing that should be against their
honor. hit is well troth / that in the p^sence of the grettest princes of
greece. I have auo wed to bring to end this e^terpse: how well that it be
meruaillous and doubteuse: shall j then^e go against my word. Certes there ne is
way ne moyen none but that I must needs furnisshe this adventure. or ellis
that I be poynted with the finger of reproach and cowardyse / and as a right
recreat knight / By all my gods I had lever tabyde this aue^ ture. then^e
fortune should predestine me to do thing that j might in any manner be
reprehe^ded or reproched. Incontinent as medea vnder^tood the hye will of
jason. she was much ioyod / nevertheless she feigned to be dolente and sorrowful:
and of fait she re^red Hercules. that he would show to hi the great paril that
he would put him in. but hercules ansuerde to her that he would rather
cou^ceile jason to do it then^e to leave it / For if jason failed to furnisshe
this emprise that he him self would take it on ho^de to br^ge hit to end /
Nevertheless sai / de then^e Medea if Iaso^ believed my counceyll he should go no
ferther. and I shall say to him such reason aparte And when she saw that they
were so fer from the other / that they might not understand what she said.
she said to him in this wise / In verite right noble knight* hit^ehoueth that
pitye of a woman ^ust (...) e^cused by your g^t^nesse / j have pite of you and
of your great beauty. ^d certes nature has enclyned me there to. and trustyng
if I do any thing for you ye will know it The hour is come that hit behooves
that I do appear to your eyes the secret not only of my heart: but also that
same by the which ye shall obtain and come above to bre^ge to end your
meruayllous enterprise to your great glory and honor and reco^me^dacion by the
help of the gods. And for asmoche as if I declare to you by great love
things that be^ high and great / if ye will further know of them it is of
necessite / that ye swear to me to keep it secret above all other things of
the worl / de *

Madame a^suerde then^e jason / j am a pour and true knightsent unto the se
mo^stres. certes hit has plesid you to do me more honor then^e ever it shall
lie in my power to deserve: nevertheless when your pyetous heart will e^clyne
unto my pouerte j swear to you by the names of all the gods that men worshipe
/ that if ye declare to me any thing that as long as j shall live. it shall not
dept^ from my mouth. By my law sir knight ansuerde Medea / I have great
confidence in your noblesse / wherefore I am resolewed for to discouuer to you
the secret of the gods / and after that lies on my heart which if it be
not^^g on you / it shall redou^de to your great honor and prouffit. Madame
a^suerde Jason. it shall not hold on me / and if ye know any thing propice to
my whorship I me s^bmitte in all unto your right noble grace / Haa noble knight
said then^e medea. I may no longer feign. my^eyen have beholde^ your great
beauty. ye ben a^ the desir of mine heart. where there werketh love so perfondly
that j have great pity of you: and in such wise that if ye will promise me to
be my true husbonde / and brenge me into your country after your vow and
enterprise brought to an end. I shall promise you and also show how ye shall
mow co^quere the moton^ or f^ees of gold without danger of your body and in
such wise as ye shall return hole and sauf to your glory and honor / To the
which no mortal man may come but if it be by a secret manner / coming from
the gods / The which not long syn was deliuerid to me by my mother. wherefore I
pray you that ye wi^ ^^ue regard to mine offer abadon^ed. ^ also to your health

When jason had understand medea thus speak / he began to frown ^ him self
and sighing with an heavy heart answerde / Madame ye constrayne me to be
beholde^ more to you then^ to any creature living: and I can not conceive from
whens this ewr comes: when I feel me thus fallen in your grace: and I would it
plesid the gods that I were digne and worthy thereto: and that I never had
made vow to lady in the world Certes fair sire said medea / me ^emeth that
your herthath atteyned the mercy of some lady. have ye ensured and wedded her /
Madame answerde jaso^: j certefye you nay / but I have set my love in her so
perfaitly / tha^in no manner I may forgete her. and I have promised that j shall
be heeris al my life / Then^ said / Medea. what some ever be there of / it is of
necessite that ye leave and put her in oublia^ice. and that ye entende to
complaire me ^f ye will not receive the death: for b^t if ye depart you fro
your enterprise / without mine aid there is no remedy / And if I be cause of
sauacio^ of your life / as to the regard of me / j will enyoie you allone
without any other. My dear lady a^s werde then^ jason the pour abando^ned body
is youris. for to honor and serve you in all that in me shall be possible. In
good faith fair sire jason: if ye will give your self al ^ome. I shall give my
self to you in like wise

In verite jason answerde my right dear lady ye do to me right great honor
without deseruyng / Certes sire jaso^ a^swerde the lady / love is cause of this
well and pity has comanded me to do it. the which cause me to ren^e i^ so
great a shame as for to require you to be my lord / but it seems to pite that
in favor that j desire to save your life / ye ought to excuse me Madame
a^suerde jason j shall never be so ewrous as to come j^stely unto the good g^ce
of one so noble lady / as ye be. and would right well that hit should mow be.
but what shall become and shall mow say she that ^ have given my self to: if ye
forsake her not: on all pertyes said then^ medea j may not help you to do
your co^queste ne ssaue yo life / and therefore chese ye / for j a^ smyte^ to the
heart wit your love syn that ^ must sayeal. If I should be cause of saving of
your life / and then^ happend an other should enyoye your person. it should
beho^e me to dye for sorrow / and therefore the^ke ye what ye have to do and be
ye advised. Wit these words jason and medea e^trid into the gardyn of
plaisa^ice: in which was set the temple of venus (...) such wise ad^i^o^ned
and set about wit f^oures and with delicious works that hit seemed a very
parady^ terrestre.

The^^e hercules and the other ladies and da^^o^selles approached unto jason and
meden. wherefore it behooved hem to leave and ^esse their perlaine ^: and to
behold the plaisa^ice and that the delices of that place of f^oures / and all the faco^ns of vignes and trees hyly cond^yted by conpas. When the greky ss^^
knights had see^ and ^^cyued the beauty of this place. they had thereof great
marvel and were much esbayed and after they entered into the temple, and there
made their oroiso^^s and syn beheld the composition and ordo^na^ces of the
images that rep^sented the amorous people al about the goddess venus / and
wha^ they had long see^ and beholde^ all. meda took leave of jaso^ and said
that she would abide a lityl while: and then^e jason deperted fro the temple and
returned with the greeks unto the palace / and the fair medea abode in the
temple much pensif and in great ^ayne ^ somoch that after the departing of the
greeks she knelid down hu^bli tofore the rep^sentacion of venus. and said in
this manner Right sovereign goddess of lovers which hold all the faytes of
nature in thy domynacion and seignourie I yield me unto thy good mercy. ha a
and where may ^ be come for to have good cou^ceylle. j have required the noble
knight jason of love or at lest j have reveled and shewid to him the secret
of mine heart and of my thought and with that I have offryd to say to him and
declare the secret of the gods: have I done evil / I wot never. but at
lest I apperceyue clearly that I have my self to him abandonned and gy^en. Haa
what shame is this. ye verayli and more if he daigneth not to here me: but if I
may do somoche that he accord unto my will / this shall be to me the most gretest
glory that may come to any woman of a noble house: ha a high gods cou^ceylle
me enseigne and tech me put your help to this werk to your ^cell. it is now
time or never After this oriso^i abode there the fair medea as al rauisshed and
was so long there til the ladi thather had in guard ca^ to her and said that she
tarried and made her prayers to long and that hit was time to return to the
palace Then^e aroos medea from her contemplacyon all esprysed of love. as her
visage shewid it plainly and reforned hom ward. And wha^ she was comen to the
palais. she found that the king abode her for to goo to dinner but she gaf the
king to understand that she was not well dispesed and so the king set him at
the table with jason. the noble hercules / and theseus and Caliope the second
daughter: and Medea went unto her chamber and many ladies and damoiselles
followed her. how well she made hem all deperte and go out of the chamber / and
retained non^ with her reseruid the lady that had the conduyte and charge of
her: the which was right sore abass^id of the maintene of Medea Wherefore
incontinent as all the women were withdrawn she came to her and said thus. My
dear daughter I have great meruaille from whens this maladye is comen to you.
In good faith a^swerde medea fair mother / it needs nothing to you to
marvel. For there is no creature what that ever they be. but that they must be
subge^ to receive the maladies and ske^es wha^n they come and wha^ the godd and
fortune will send the^ / Your reson^ is good said then^ the lady / but when
the maladyes ben come^. it behooves to seche remedy as soon as is possible /
and therefore tell ye to me your necessite / and where the seke^es holds and
greueth you / and j shall advertise the medicine or phisicien that he shall
pourueye for remedy / A ha fair mother said Medea. Late me in pee^ It must
needs be that ye tell me ^swerde the lady It is adventure said medea. Wherefore
said the lady. For asmoche as mine infirmite is over secret and for somoch I
dar not discouere it. A ha my dete lady said then^. I suppose that hit ben
amourettis that thus trauaylle you. and / I am in doubt that the^^eaute and
the noble virtues of jason ben cause berof / for j see you all in other manners
then^ ye were wont to be / and if it be so: tell hit to me hardyly / for ye be
the creature above all other of the world that I love best: I have unto this
time / the best wise I coud governed a^dnourisshid you: and for so much me
seems that ye should hyde no thing from me and if ye be any thing smyten wit
the dart of love. discouere it unto me: that shall be unto your heart great
alegement / for every person amorous passes his pain and grief lightly. when
she finds / to who^ she may open heart and devise clearly. My fair mother
said then^e medea / I see well that it behooves that ye knowt all mine af
fair. Certes verily I amourouse of jason / and somoche that I should jeoperde
my life for him / and in deed I have required him that he take me to his wife.
and j shall deliuere to him the industry and teache him hou he shall win the
^sces of gold. and also adau^te the ferdful bestes of the isle of Colchos Wha^
the lady had understand this that said is. she began to weep tenderly sayng.
Ha a dear daughter what have ye done. I am all dishonored by you / wha^ ye go
prayng the strange knights of love. Haa what outrage Certes they shall moc^
you. and if it be known ye shall never be honored ne called: as ye tofore have
be^ / Know ye fair mother a^swerde then^ medea / that I have not done: so ill
as ye wene. and if I have required the noble knight jason of love / hit shall
reputed to me virtue and not shame ne dishonor / for pity has ^strayned me so
to do / for asmoch as hit is in me to save his life / and to make hi^ return
with glory and victory of his enterprise. and for so much know ye that
then^e when j have see^ so fair and so well adressid knight that his like shall
not be seen in a. M. year. I have had pity of him. and above this love has
made me enterprise that I have required him considered many things. and that
he would never have required me / and j have made to him a promise which I will
hold and entretiene / if he will ensure me that I shall be his wife. for j have
here within by writing the manner how the gods will that the moton^ or sheep
of gold shall be conquered: wherefore I require and pray you: that ye councele me
and help that by your con^yng and conduyte I might get and draw him to my
love / and that ye would do somoch for the love of me / that he have no
souenau^ce of any other la die in the world / save only on me: for it is force
that it so be or ellis he be deed and perisshed in the isle of colchos where he
has auowed to go and finisshe the end of the right perilous aue^ture of the
moton^ or flees of goolde: And finably that in be wailing and be weeping his
death j be homycide of him and of my self.

Then^e the lady seeing medea to be in this point beheld and saw how she was
of a meruaillous and great courage and yet she thought that there might come
harm of if the maid accomplisshid not party of her desire: and syn brought
to her reme^bran^ce / that she might bring jason to conquer the moton^ or
flees of gold: and when she had put al thise things in a balan^ce and
fiched in her engyn she began to reconforte medea: and in deed promised her
that she should so do / that without other moyen she should enjoy the love of
jason. and it was not long after but that she went to the bed of jason* and
there made certain coniurison^s and carectes. for she was all expert in all
manners of enchanteme^s and of sorceries / and wha^ she had thus done she
camagayn to medea. and said to her that she should no more doubt of any thing:
for from after the time that jason be leyd and couched in his bed he should
never love other woman but her* and so it be fell. for as soon as Jason was
leyd in his bed at the even / all his courage and ente^dement were ranysshed
in thinki^g on the great beauty of Medea in such faco^n as he might in no wise
sleep

MOpsius had a custom to speak every night with jason / And then^e jaso^
would speak of the beauty of the noble queen myrto / and often times he spak so
much of her that he was weary / And then^e when this mopsius saw that in this
night he made no mention of his lady / he was all abasshid and said to him.
Verayly jason I apperceyue well that your esperite is trauailled with new
fa^tasies. I have seen that ye have passed the most part of the night for
tailowe and preyse the beauty of your lady in love the fair Mirro: and yet ye
spoke of her the night precede^t* But in this night the rewle faylleth / Certes
a^swerde jason yt is expedient that she be put with the sins in oubliance:
For as for mirro I recche never thaugh I never seen mere with her / But say
to me freely. what seems you of Medea / Is she not the passerowte of all the
ladies of the world Is not she the tryumphe of al beauty. Is there any man in
the world that could or might better wisshe for his recreacion. Answer to me:
Sy^e said Mopsius I me accord right well to that ye say touching the caas of
medea But unto the regard of the fayt Myrro that so much have be recommanded
in your courage / I may not bylene that ye have put her in oublia^ce By my law
my fair friend said then^e jason. Who is fer fro the eye. fro the heart
reculeth / Mirro is clear as gold / but medea flaumeth and shyneth as the
precionse stone And if I might find my self in her grace / I should love her
souueraynly: ^ ha said Mopsius / I held you for the most loyal and most
constant knight. that euyr gaf him to serve love. and now I apperceyue that ye
be variable as other be. Be ye not remembrid of ysiphile whom^ ye would never
will to love / and that ye said If myrro ne had been ye would have espoused her
I am esbaied of you more then^e of any man / Certes mopsius ansuerde ja son jf
ye will do to me any plaisir. speak to me no more of Myrro ne of ysiphile. but of
the fair medea speak long ynow and largely. For this is she that I will keep
in my co^ceyte and her that I shall serve unto the death / and who that speaks
to me of other shall be mine enemy.

When Mopsius had understand the will of Jason he spack no more / but slepte.
and jason abode al pensyf on the fairelady Medea / And medea that herkenyd / as
she had don the night to fore went into her chamber anon^ as the perle^e^t of
the ij. knights was don: and ca^ to her mother all reco^forted and said to
her. and recounted all that she had herd / and syn leide her i^ her bed
ymagynyng how she might fide her self a part to speak wit jason. and concluded
i^ her self that she would go on pylgremage unto the temple of the goddess
deane. sayng if that jaso^ louid her a^ he had said he would not deperte for
nothing but come after her ^^is conclusion was not taken without habundaunce
of syghes. The night drew over and the day began to show. and the fair medea
aroos. and made the noise run that she was hool. and that for the recouura^ce
of her health. she would goo thank the goddess deane in her temple /

After this she atired and arrayed her in the fairest wise she could or might /
and in process she put her o^ the way rightnobly accompanied of ladies and
damoiselles / Whereof jason was right yoyous when he knew hit / and desired the
way as soon as he might / Certes he followed Medea under the couersure of will
to go by good devotion to the temple. O fair couerture the human people liui^g
at this day hold the same term in many places / and goo to the temples and
chirches or in the holy places ordo^ned to god by denocyo^ for tefface. and put
away their sins And yet nevertheless they commyse there their sins and for to
come to the love of one and other / they go more to the mass for to behold
and look each upon other. and for to make their tours and signs then^e for any
devotion. O high devotion / o right dampened ypocresie: men cominyse sins
where they ought to be in devotion. and do virtuous works / they begyle
lightly ynow the world to her charge and dampnacyon. But certes god in no wise
may be abused

FOr then^e to return to our matter / jason thus comen to the temple where as
medea was / first of all he made semblau^t for to adoure and worshipe the
gods and set him down on his knee to fore the awter of the goddess pallas
and Deane. but for this time he neither made prayer ne oroison^. but thought
what manners he might best hold against Medea. And of what purpoos he might
make to her his enter. And when he had long auised him: he aroos and took his
way unto medea / which came against him But then^ wha^ she saw that he drew
him toward her / and that they had entersalewed and that Jason had made the
reverence unto the other ladies: Medea entrid subtylly / in devises with hi And
in devising of one and other she drew him a lytil a part against the awter of
Dyane whom they began to behold. and then^ jaso^ making manner as he had spoken
of the goddess Dyane. and of rich wood that here and there aduironned yt he
said to her in this manner Madame lo here your pour knight I yield me unto
your mercy. and am ready tacco^plisshe all your good co^mandeme^ts. and pray
you if ^ said yesterday any thing that was to your display sir / that hit
would plaise you to perdonne me / and if ye may help and aid me to bri^ge to
a good e^de my vow and enterprise and socoure me in that great werk I swear
and prinse to you in calling to wytnes of mine oath the high goddess Dyane and
pallas. that if it please you to be my dear felaw and friend / I shall be youres
all my life and shall bring you with me into Greece wythouthe making any fawte

Jason answered then^e Medea I declared to you yesterdaye my caas all privily /
and how I had great pytie of you. ^ know also that the gods have had pity
on you / and will not consent that ye should fynisshe your days in Colchos /
and that they have inspired you to submit you to my will. for other wise hit
were not possible but that ye should be there ded and lost. therefore for to go
forth and make short / for we may not long hold parliament after your
ordena^ce and covenant I shall accord me to^^e your wife. in all such manner as
I promised to you yesterday: And yet I promise you that of your auowe and
enterprise ye shall come above to your honor and prouffit / ye to morn^er the
even be derk and obscure / then^e it is expedient that ye lie allone this night
in your chamber: to the end that I may the better speak to you and at more
leyzer: and to introduce you more secretly into such thingis as shall behoue
you to hold / and speak no more to me of this matere at this present time* that
none apperceyue of our e^terpryse or of our love. With this the noble lady
began to show to the noble preu jaso^ / the great richesse of this
representacyon of the goddess deane / and Jason allowed hyghly the king oetes
that so well had don it to be ediffied / with thise words Medea took leave of
Jason and of the other knights of greece / which tarried a lytill there. and
after returned unto the cite / and after she departed from thens And there was
Jason complained and be wailled of all the people: Sayng one to an other that yt
was right great dommage of one so gentill a knight and so well adressid that
would goo and do destroy him self in all points in the mortal adventure of
Colchos. They spak and said much thing one and other: And in especyal the
noble King Oetes. the which came to jason as he departed out of the temple of
the gods deane: and much discou^ceyled hi^ thenterprise of colchos and that
for nothing he should desce^de affermyng to hi that he should lose his life if he
entered* and that he that had sent him theder. did hit for to make him dye
cautelous^y

Jason heering the counceyll that the king Oetes gaf h^ for his weel: thinking
how a knight lives in great reprouche when* he goth against his auowe and
promise. And considering the conclusion and promise that he had made wy^
medea: abode ferme and stable in his first purpoos / sayng unto the king Oetes
that for death ne for any other (...) that might come to him he would not
deporte him but bre^gen to an end and in deed xcluded that on the morn^
without any longer tarie^g he would make an e^de thereof. wherefore the king
Oetesdemened much great sorrow. and in like wise did all the knights of greece
/ reseruid Hercules and Theseus / and so passid that day spekyng of this
meruaillous werk / unto the eue^ that every man withdrew him unto his place /
and the valliaunt knight jason took leave of every man for to withdraw him I to
his chamber and gas Mopsius to understand. that he would pass that night in
orison^^. and all devotion and co^te^placion / and that he he would have no
man^ with him at at that time. whereof diverse had great meruaille / for asmoche
as he had not be acoustomed so to do / and so in said that men should not
suffer him to take so mortal an enterprise. from whene he should never return:
Considering the high and recom^anded vines where with he was e^dowed

How the promesses between jason and Medea were rateffied / And how medea
deliuerld to him all the mestier and craft that he ought to have to conquer
the noble moton^: or flees of gold: and how he gate hit


T* the point then^e wha^ the sterres re^drid their clerenes and clarte. and
that the moon began ^^^^mine the night. jason withdrew him into his chamber /
and Medea (...) not: she espied and seeing that he ^thdrawen al allone as she
^ged him: she ope^de the do^steyre by which descended (...) from the chamber
of jason i^to heerls And callid down jason which was right pe^syf. And when
jaso^ saw the door opene. and medea that callid him / he went unto her much
ioyously and salewed her / and after approached to her for to have kiste and
enbrached her. but Medeasaide to him that he should cesse. and taking hi by the
hand brought hi^ into her chamber where they satte upon a much rich tapyte.
The maistresse of medea came then^e between the^ / and when she was comen Medea
began to speak and say. Jason my lord and my friend / ye know well the
promesses that been between you and me / I will well that in the presence of my
good mother that here is / that we make recognycion and ratefye them to the end
that they be hole and permanent. and after that we shall entende to your
conquest And then^e jason and medea swore and crean^ced that they should take
each other by marriage. and there made sole^pne promesses. Whereof Medea was
rightyoyouse / and so also was her maistresse Then^e Medeaope^de a coffre
which she had made ready / where out she drew a sherte: with the bille
containing thordonnau^ces which were requisyte and propice for to goo into the
isle of Colchos to make the conquest of the flees of gold

When Medea had drawn out the lettre. She did it to be read to her friend
Jason: and after she said to him in this manner. Jason my dear friend for to
return hooll and with your worship from the jle of Colchos from whens never
man^ returned. hit is of necessite that to fore all other things ye
accomplisshe all tho thiges that been contained in this writing Which the god
Mars sent to the king appollo. And for so much first to fore all other thing
ye shall goo unto the temple of the goddess dine at thye hour / And then^e ye
shall adresse you unto the priest: to whom ye sha^^ ^yue fyfty besau^tes for
your of^. and demand of him a bole of w^ ye shall make sacrefice unto the
(...) Mars. with this sherte / which ^he ^ollo was clad wha^ this writing was
deliuerid to him / and ye must put in your box the blood of this bole with
part of the asshen of your sacrefice / and with this blood and asshenye shall
enoynte ther^ all your body / and this shall preserve you from fire and venyn
of the right meruaillous bestes. After of the residue of these ashes ye shall
dele them in ij. parties. whereof that one part ye shall keep clean and pure:
and ye shall meddle that other with glue in a box which I shall give you: and
this glewe shall serve for to dompte the two horrible boles / this done. ye
shall take the arms of the king appollo. which ben on that one side of the
awter of the god mars / and ye shall adoube you with them. and then^e when ye
have accomplisshed all thise things / ye shall return hither again to me / and
I shall furnisshe you of the residue of that shall be behouefull to bring your
co^queste to an end: Certes the preu Iaso was much esineuruaylled then^e when
he understood the high mysteres that him behooved to make for to come above of
his conqueste. and when he had herd thensignements of medea / he thanked her
often times. and then^e took the bylle / the sherte. the box with glewe / and
that which was necessary to him. And syn deperted from thens secretly. and
went him into the forest where as was the temple of the goddess deane.
a^ddyde so much that he came to the temple where he found the priest slepyng:
wherefore he a waked hi^ / Then^e the priest demanded him what he was and what
he sought. Sire answerde then^e jason: I am a knight that come hither for to
sacrefie unto the god Mars. I pray vow that ye would deliuere me incontinent a
bole with the fire and I shall give you for mine offri^g fyfty besan^ts: When the
priest had understand jason / that he promised so good an offide he rose up
hasteli. and in like wise done all the priests and curates at this day when
they feel and understand that there shall one a good offrande come to their
singular prouffit anon^ put their hand to the cause. Then^e wha^ this master
pressed was risen he came to fore jason and did him great reverence / and after
said to him that diligently he should be seruid of all that he demanded. as he
did: for he p^pared and made ready the fire / and bole which he brought into
the temple. Then^e the noble Iaso^ mad his oroison^ unto god mars. and unto god
appollo / He took after this the bole and made his sacrefice and put the shert
thereto. and wha^ al was turned into ashes he distribued it into three parties /
one part with the blood of the bole / which he retained and enointed his body
with al by the priest / The second party / he meddled with the glewe that was
in the box. and the third part he put in a lytyl sack of sylk which he
reseruid and kept clean

These things done and acco^plisshed as said is. jason knelid down and made
his prayers the second time: and when he had made all his deuocyons / he
delivered to the priest fyfty besan^tes. that he had promised to him: and with
that he presented and gaf him a rich mantel of cloth of gold which he brought
with him / and made the priest to a adoube him with the arms of god appollo.
which was there: promysing him to bring them again: and when the priest had
armed jason at all points / jason reco^manded hi^ unto god mars and Appollo.
and to the goddesses dyane / pallas and venus and syn took leave of the priest
and did somoche that he returned secretly into his chamber / by the which he
descended into the chamber of Medea whom he fond slepi^g When Jason saw Medea
in this point: and also saw her maistres aslepe; he was terrybly esprysed with
love / and chauffid in somoche that the blood began to boylle in his body. and
his heart began to desire so sorein such faco^n / that he approached to medea
and kyssed her mouth: but with the kysshing she awoke: and had much great joy
then^ when she had see^ and espied him so armed with the arms of the king
appollo: Then^ jason made the reverence to Medea and after said to her in this
manner / Madame I have don all ^hatye have enseigned nie also nyghe as I
might. and am enoynted with the blood of the bole / of whom i^ have made
sacrefice to the gods: and lo here the glue medlid with a pert of the ashes.
command me now that shall plese you what I shall do. and speed you for it is
nyghe day / My friend answerde medea welcome be the day. and anon^ with the
aid of the gods ye shall get the grettest glory that ever knight living
gate / and know ye in the recomme^dacion of you and great preysing hit shall be
spoken of / unto the end of the world

With thise words she took a vestiment which was rich and gaf it to him
sayng: My fair love ye be pourueyed of all that is behouefull for you so that
ye have this vestime^t upon your arms. see that ye work freely and corageeusly
with this that ye have. ye must be pourueyed wy^ hardiness and valiau^ce /
keep well your bille. and be diligent to do and acco^plisshe all that it
contieneth. and by the plaisir of the gods* j shall have you here at euene
with more gretter ^solacion / Then^e jason clad him above his harnoys with the
propre vestiment that appollo was cladd at the hour when he receyuid the bylle
a fore said With that the day apperid fair and clear. wherefore jaso^ took leave
of medea. which was al rauysshed with love / At leave taki^g they kyssed each
other many times / Fynably medea conveyed jason unto his chamber door: and
their began there amotonse baisier^ and kisshinges unto the time that it was
force that Medea must withdraw her. and then^e she recommanded jason in the
guard of the gods. and shette fast the door. it was not long after that
Mopsius and hercules came and knokked at the chamber door of Jason / and with
the^ the good knight Theseus and many other all of greece / which salewed jason
and gafe him the good morrow. but wha^ they espied that he was tho armed and ^^
point; they were much esbayed and would have axed of him who had so armed him
and adowbed. But the king octes and other of his knights came also to him and
salewed jason and the king seeing jason in point / took the words and said: A
ha sire knight what will ye do / ye seek your destruction / wha^ so erly ye
begyn^ to put you forth: I counceylle you that ye deporte you of this
enterprise / and I declare you ellis homycide of your self: For he is of him
self homicide: that knows his death in a place and volu^taryly he put him self
therein Sire king a^swerde then^e jason: I confess that ye con^ceyle me wisely
/ but nevertheless in hope for to live j have well entencion^ to achieue mine
e^terpryse without longer delay / j thank you of the great honor that ye
have made me unto this time / Mopsius took the word and said /

Certes jaso^ fair sire I have this night had a meruayllous vysion: the which
conforteth me in your victory / For me seems in my first dreme. that j saw
a sperhauke the which sechyng his pray put him self among many other
terrible birds / and of strange nature / the which in a little while he had
all overcome / and put to death. and so j compare tho same birds terrible and
of strange nature: unto the two boles and to the serpent being in the isle of
colchos: which every night cast fire and fumyer / and as touching the
sperhauke I understand you that seching his (...) that i^ to say your
adventure on this day / by the aid of the gods* ye shall be made vaynqueure
of the horrible monstres and possessour of right gloriouse renommee

When jason had vnderstonden this that said is. He a^swerd to mopsius sayng.
Certes fair sire the gods shall do their will of me And if hit be their good
plaisir / your vision shall be holde^ for certain a prophecye / And with that
he adressid his words to hercules and said. My loyal brother and well belouid
felawe Make good chere and pray for me. I have no manner donbtance that I ne
shall soupe at even with you / and that I shall affranchyse you of your vow
semblable to myn^. With thise words many began to weep / Then^ the noble preu
jason took leave of one and other. and syn required to the king that he might
goo unto the ladies and damoyselles. The king did do assemble them / and when
they were comen into the halle: he brought jason which made to them the
reverence and princypally to Medea and caliope. and syn recomma^ded him unto
their prayers / and when he had done this by space of time. he put him unto the
way unto the Ryuage of the sea / where his master maro^ner was / that abode
and awayted upon him in a lityl bote that he had made ready the day to fore:
Into the which he entr^d and in recomma^ding him self to all the world / he
departed from the poorte for to desce^de into the isle of Colchos

This morenyng was fair and clear. and clean from all clouds. And the son
casted his clear rays and bemes upon the earth / The ladies and damoiselles
mounted and went upon the high stages of the palace / And the bourgeyses and
mercha^ts with the commun people of the cite ran^ some to the creueaul^ and
batilleme^ts of the walls. and other to the ryuage of the sea for to behold
the adventure of the noble knight of greece. Iaso^ that ioyously went with Argos
his master maronner that brought hi^ into a right good entree of the
meruaillous isle adressid him and set foot a ground upon the gravel And took
his glewe and his ashes and entrid into the isle by great desire and hardynesse
/ And he had not far goon^ when he espied the rich moton^ or sheep of gold /
which was so resple^disan^t that it reyoyced all the isle. After he espied the
two boles lepyng out of their holes. so great / so dredefull / so right fires
and hydouse that only for to look on them it was enough for to lose wit and
understanding / and wha^ he had well beholden the^. He knelyd doun^ on the earth
against the eest where he saw a temple al of gold of the gretnes of. xvj. foot
in eight squares founded on viij. small pylers, thretty foot of heyght. in the
mids where of was an m^ter upon which was an image representing the god Mars

Then^e there Jason worshypped the god Mars / and there was in co^templacyon
unto the time he saw the cruelle and terrible dragon^ spring out of the temple
For he was great as an horse. And was thretty foot long the which incontinent
as soon as he was out of the temple he began to reyse his neck. set up his
eeris: s^racche him self. Opende his throat and cast out brennyng flawme and
smoke by a meruaillous voyding which depertad out of his stomak Then^ saw
Jason al these. iij. bestes with whom he must have to do. he took and beheld
his bylle for to know what he had to do: he found that first he must adaunte
the two boles / wherefore he aroos from his co^templacion and made ready the
box wit glue / After he marched promptly / in great hardynes toward the*twoo
boles which beheld him right fiersly and asprely with her eye^ sparkkyng and
brenni^g as fire grekyssh And they began to desgorge fire and flambe out of
their throtes against the knight so desmesurably that all the Regyon of the
air and all the country seemed brenne with wild and grekysshe fire. But this
notwythstanding they might never travail ne do harm unto the noble preu
Jason: But he by great hardynesse ^^proched by the fire the flambe and vonyn
that they casted / and did so much that enoynted the mosels of both two. and
cast into their throthee the glewe that was myxed and medlid wit ashes which
he brought with him as said is: But as soon as these boles felt the glewe and
cendres to gyder medlid. certes they closed their trothes and mosels in such
wise as they might never open^e after ne cast more fire / whereof the noble
knight was so joyous as he might be seeing the xperiment to be of so high
recommendacion. Then^ he thought on Medea and said well in him self that she
had deliuerid to hi^ a good and very socours and for certain he had lost his
life in this adventure ne had she have been.

After this consideracio^ incontinent as the noble preu jason apperceyuid that
these two meruaillous boles were ouercomen and adaunted / then^e he beheld the
contenu of his bylle. and fo^de that then^e him behooved anon to go fight
against the meruaillous dragon^ and terrible without comparison^ / Then^e he
drew out his good sword of the shet he and went unto the temple where the
dragon^ held him. anon^ as the monstre had apperceyued jason / he eufelon^ed
him self / and by great Ire opend his throat rigght terrible in gretnes out of
whom sprang three thonges castyng fire flambe and venyn in such wise that the
good knight had al his body aduiron^ed there with: hou well that the fire ne the
venyn had no power upon him. but passed by jason like as hit had be the
clerenes of the son and he came and gaf the monstre so great a stroke with his
sword between the two eye^ that he made his heed hurtle against the croupe
right sore and durely And wha^ the dragon^ felt this struck / he releuyd him
self and syn ope^de again his throat and disgorged upon jaso^ a fumee so thikke
of venyn that the noble knight saw nothing about him. but this not
withstandyng he haunced his sword and discharged hit upon the dragon^ / where
he thought his head was: and smote so well the monstre that he cut of his three
to^ges even by the mosel as nigh as they might be: whereof the serpent felt so
meruaillouse pain and dolor that he began to frote and rub his head And
turned on that one side so suddenly that with his taille he smote the
vaillaunt knight on the bak that he fille down on the sand

Wha^ jaso^ felt him so smyte^ doun^ to the earth he was so fore astonyed that
he wist not what was befalle him. and with this he had great shame He releued
him and stood up anon^. but at his releuyng the fumee of the dragon^ was
vanisshed / and in seeing about him he apperceyueyd the three tongues of the
serpent / which he had smyten of / and syn he beheld the dragon^ which froted
his mosell an herb. and then^e he ran upon him agayn^ and smote in the mids
of the tayll: in exployti^g the most pert of al his stre^gthe and also his
tre^chan^t sword in such manner. that he cut of a piece which was seven foot
long Then^e the dragon by great payn^ that he felt haunced his heed and came
right fiersly and recou^tred jaso^ wit all his pesaunteur and might / in such
a faco^n that jaso^ was bete^ doun^ to the ground And the dragon^ passed over
him / But then^e the preu jason took his swerd and roof into the pau^che of the
dragon^ up to the cross and smote hi^ to the heart / and the dragon feling
that he was smyte^ to the death began to re^ne with the sword of jason in his
body wenyng to hyde hi^ self in his cauerne. But his life deperted out of the
body even as he should have entrid into the temple And there he ouerthrewe all
to stracched and fowlid of his blood and of his humeurs fulle of venyn / jn
such wise as hit seemed that hit had been a sourse or a spring rennyng out of
his body le^ger then^ a great hour

Incontine^t that jason was releued and that he apperceyued the dragon^
reuersed and deed at thenthre of the temple / with an heart recomforted he
went theder and drew out his sword of his body: and put hi^ agyn in his
shethe or skabarde. and then^e he went and seized the boles by the horns /
and yoked them i^ a plowe that there was by: and made them to ere four mesures
of land. enclosing their eyen^: And then^e when he had so done / he returned
to the dragon^ and esrachd out of his head. xij. teth / after that he sowed
them in the earth that he plowed: and that done he did the boles do harowe hit
/ And then^e the boles fill doun^ to the earth and lost the spyryte of life /
and out of the land that jaso^ had so wen^ with the teth of the dragon^ grew
and sprang up in an instant xij. gea^ts of a terryble maintene / the which were
al armed after the manner of that time And as soon as they were comen out of the
earth drew their swerdes and without delayng came and supposed to have smyte^
upon jason. but Jason took the cendres or ashes pure that he had kept of his
sacrefice / and cast it into the air. and then^ suddenly to same xij. gea^ts
assailed that one that other by such asprete and sharpness that in a litill
while each slew other. whereof jason was ryghtyoyous and re^drid tha^kinges and
louynges to the gods

When these. xij: geants had slain each other as I have reherced unto you Jason
drew out his swerd / which was yet all blody. and came to the rich moto^ or
sheep whom he found in the right noble medewe: and took him by the horns and
brought him into the temple to fore the awter of the god Mars / And there he
slew him with much great pain and syn flew him and took the flees that ^^^d
the wolle all of fyn gold and said (...) a part / And the body he dispieced
by members: and bare it up on an awter which stood without the temple. and put
thereto largely straw and dry wode / and wha^ he had done this he took fire at
a lamp brennyng to fore the representacio^ of god mars / And syn knelid down
on his knees on the earth by deuocio^ to fore the ydole sayng the oroison^ to
fore wreto^ After the contenu. whereof he thanked the god Mars. and recomma^ded
him much into his grace / After this he put fire into the sacrefice which
anon was consumed and turned in to cendres or ashes / This done he put
himself to prayer: and after he took the three tongues of the meruayllous and
terryble dragon^. two of the feet of the boles which were of metal of laton and
two of their horns / which were of yron^. and enuolupped and wrapped it all
in the flees of gold which he charged and leyde it on his sholdres / And
afterward he returned unto the ryuage of the sea where his master maro^ner
named Argos which had guided his boot over the braas or arm of the sea. as
fayd is hadd abyden there in much great double.

Argos the good shipman^ was sore abasshid of that / that jason was so long
there: er he returned to him and thought for tabyde no longer. for he had seen
the fire and the fumee great and thikke lift up into air And also he had seen
many evil apparauces voyses. and right strange bruyts. for which causes he
supposed that his master jason had been devoured of the terrible bestes / And
began to weep and bewail him right tenderli. but incontinent when he espied
the vailliaunt knight Jason with the flees of gold on his neck: his teres and
wepinges cessed / For sorrow crainte and doubt departed from his her / te. and
all yoye aduirouned him in such manner. that smyling he knelid doun^ on his
knee to fore him and said Sire knight myrrour of all vailliaunce and of all
enterprise. ye be right well turned. Ha a what co^solacion and gladness shall be
in Myrmidone and with my lord your fader. Men have murmured upon peleus your
uncle and every man said that he had se^te you hither for to be quite of you /
thinking that ye should never have returned but to that I can apperceyue. he
desires above all other thing your glory and honor. Certes argos fair sire
answered then^ sason. Fortune has so much aid and helped me. that* I am
returned hoole of body and of members fro the most terrible dangerous and
mortal parill that ever shall befalle and come upon the earth during the
world whereof I yield louinges and thankinges unto the goo Mars principally /
but now (...) us think to return unto our felawes: For hit is more then^e
time to ete

With these w^^des the good shipman began to to we with afra^k courage. And the
greeks that were sta^dyng upon the ryuage of the sea. began then^e a great
stryf / For sum said that Jason was reentred in to ^he barque / and that
they had seen the resplendisshour of the noble flees of gold. which was with
great pain ^^^^le* for asmoche as from this riuage unto the isle of colchos
was. iiij good^^nyles: and the other said that jason was long agon^ deed and
that he should never be see^. But thus as each man was susteyning his argument
sherwyt was the boot seen^ approchyng much radely the ryuage: and was about
amyle nygh to the porthe. Jason took his flees and lift it up alytyl in the
air. ye as high as he might / and held hit so hye / that they that were at
the ryuage and on the walls of the cite beheld hit and apperceyued hit and
showed hit one to an other by great admyracion and wondre.

Many therwere that demened great joy. and thanked the gods wy^ good heart
when they had perceived the noble and the rich flees. whereof the preu jaso^
made the mustre fro ferte / and some ran for to gadre of the grene herbs and
verdure for to cast along on the way / where as jaso^ should pass for to goo
to the palace / sayng to every man that they were certain of his retournyng /
and that all honor ought to be mad to him for one so noble and gloriouse
conqueste / Medea among all other was so ryghtioyous wha^ she espied the light
and shyning of the flees of gold that her seemed that she should enter into a
paradise terrestre. And commanded that her ladies and damoiselles should put on
the fair front in entencyo^ to make feste soleinpne for the honor of this
right excellent victory / and for to come to a conclusion: tro^pes / tabours
menestreles / horns sa^fasinois and business began to blow up and sown
melodyoussy after that time used / The maro^ner argos rowed in such wise that
he brought Jason to the poorte hoole and sauf / where he was fested of the king
oetes: of the worthy hercules and of theseus / and generally of all the greeks
Hercules took the rich flees when jason was descended upon the land / and
bare hit tofore the vaillyaunt knight jason which went first into the temple
of the goddess deane. and there thanked much hyghely the god mars. and the
gods pallas and Deane. After he made him to be disarmed. And there he yielded
again the arms of the god appollo: and syn made his oblacyon of one of the
feet of the boles / and of one of their horns with one of the to^ges of the
dragon^ / and when he had done all this solempnly / he returned to the palace
where he was right honorably receyuid of medea above all other and of her
ladies and danioyselles / which beheld Jason meruaillously. and in especia^
the noble and rich flees of gold. which hercules bare on hye tofore him.

CErtes there is no man so eloquent / ne so well can^ endyte by writing that
could descryue to you: how great playsir the eye^ of the noble and vayllyau^t
preu jason / and the eyes of the much fair medea took on then^e / when they
began to behold each other. And all the world there demened great yoye and
gladness. And when the noble knight Jason was goon up in to the halle: The
vayllyann^ knight Hercules set the noble flees of gold upon a cupberd much
rychely arrayed. And anon after the knights of greece and many other knights
ladies and Damoyselles began^ the daunces much joyously. and the feste was
fair and great unto the hour of the soupper / that the tables were couuerd.
and that the king oetes and the noble Preu Jason was set / and with them the
noble and fair lady medea. Hercules Theseus and* Mopsius. At this table was the
noble Jason and the fair Medea set one to fore that other. But in no wise
they durst not speak one word how they made many secret signs of love that
could not beapperceiued. but they entremarched wy^ their feet under the table /
whiles that jason reherced in groos the great paryls. where he had been ynne.
wylhout shaking of any mention of ordenaunces manners and cerymonyes that he had
holden.

OF this meruayllous adventure were the king Oetes Hercules and the other batons
knights and noble men^ that satte and seruid at this souper much abashed and
greatly meruaylled / and how the noble preu jason was escaped of so great and
meruaillous aue^ture And hyely recommanded this enterprise and vayliaunce /
Hercules and Theseus that a fore time had slain many monstres confessed there
that all their fayttes passed were nothing to the regard of the adventure that
jason had enterprysed and brought to an end.

What shall we make long compte: the souper passed / and the hour ca^ that
the king oetes and Jason withdrewe hem into her chambres And then^e was jason
conveyed into his chamber wit many noble men^one and other / and theder was
brought the noble and rich fleesof gold. but at this time they might not
devise ne play there as they had been acustomed / but sent he^ into her
cha^bres and mopsius with the other / sayng that all that night he would wake in
orison^s and prayers unto the gods. for asmoche as they had done to him so
great nyde comfort and honor in his works

Anon ^^^^e as the preu jaso^. was left ^^^^ys chamber as said is. the
maistresse of me dea came and opend thedore of the chamber. and demanded jason
if he would come unto her daughter / Jason answerde ye wy^ right good will.
then^ he went doun^ into the chamber of his lady which had made ready a right
fair baygne. Then^e he sale wed her. and after said to her in this manner My
dear lady know ye that I have had much great desire to see you secretli and
in your pryuaulte. for to thank you of the right great honor that by your
cause is come^ to me. and also of the mortal paril and danger that ye have
deliuerid me fro. Wherefore I thank you right humbly of all thise benefetes*
and furthermoree I p^sente you the body that ye have preserved fro death / Ready
to obey all your com^andements and playsirs Certes jason my dear love and
friend answerde the fair Medea. If your desire have been great and such as ye
say yet has mine be more as j wene / I have done the best that in me has be
possible. and I have right great joy and gladness of the knowleche that ye have
All my courage is nothing save to plase you. ye be right welcome and with great
worship returned for you and for me: And make good chiere hardyli I have
ordained for you a baygne for to wasshe you from the blood / wherwyth ye have
be^ enoynted / and therefore dispo ylle you / and enter into this bath. and
then^ we shall devise at our leyser of all works /

When the preu jason had understand this that said is: he did* of his clothes
right glad of this adventure / and syn entered into the baygne. and the fair
Medea in her coursett which had no sleues terued up her smo^ sleues and in
this point came and froted and weesshed her friend jason / And then^ when the
gentyl bacheler apper-!!ceyuid so gentil corpse and body of Medea. her fair and
ro^de tetes the whitenes of her flesh / and that he felt her hands
meruayllously soft / him seemed that his heart and his body flewe: He was so
much esprysed of an ardant desir of love. he began then^e tenbrase the lady by
the body. and syn beheld her great beauty / and thus doing he kysshed her many
times And then^e when he had been well eased and washed. medea made him to lie
in her bed heholdyng his me^bres well formed shapen and made and his color
fair and quyk. and could not turn her sight from him They were thus beholding
and auysing each other with out sayug any word But at last the noble preu
jason took the word and said. my dear lady / ye know well how j have promised
to be your husbond: and also in like wise ye have promised to be my wife /
then^e may I say I am youres and ye ar myn^. and of us two is but one thing /
then^e I require you so a^ fe^tuelly as I can or may / and for all the plaisir
that ye may do to me: that ye will come and lie by my hete in your bed. A ha
jason answerde then^ inedea. for gods sake save mine honor. Madaine a^swerde
jaso / There is no man in the world that shall keep it more then^e j shall / j am
your housbonde. and if ye come and lie in your bed by me. ye do nothing but
honor / My dear friend said medea. there is no plaisir but that I shall gladly
do to you / but for this night ye shall have pacyence of your request / and I
pray you / that to morn^ be time ye desire of my fadere the king that he would
give me to yon in marriage: and then^e do ye your deuoir: and if he be content
we shall make our wedding and spousailles here within honorably. and if he will
not I somone you here to morn^ at night at hour acustomed / and know ye for
certain that I shall do all that ye will comma^de me to do as reason is: For I
am vou^den thereto by virtue of the promesses made between you and me / And
allewaye I recomma^de to you mine honor.

When Jason had understand the good will of medea. he said in his courage
that she had wisely answered / and that he was content for tobeye to her
request. What shall I say more / the night drew over in such terms as said
is: how well Jason lay there til it was day And on the morn^ wha^ he was risen
and saw his time. he made his request unto the noble king Oetes that he would
give his daughter Medea to him in marriage. but he found the king Oetes triste
and much pensif and al other wise then^e he was acustomed to be and made him
an a^swere in this manner. Jason yebere with you out of my dominacyon the most
rich tresour that is i^ all the world: which greuith me greatly / and if I
hade known that I now know. ye had not comen in time thereto. and now ye
dema^de me my daughter medea which is most con^yng and the most dear thing that
I have. Suffice you wy^ that ye have And never speak to me more thereof. also
dear as ye have your life With these or semblable words / the king Oetes went
on oo pert And the noble jason went on an other side much abashed of the
fires and herd answer of the hing Oetes. Hercules Theseus and Mopsiuscam
then^e unto Jason / which told hem how he had be^ with the king Oetes / and
how he had required to have to his wife his daughter Medea. and how the king
oetes had answered him fiersly. But when they had understood all this /
they concluded among them that they would deperte from the^s on the morn^ /
After this done they went and took leave of the king and thanked him of the
great honor that hit had plesid him to do to Jason. And after they went and
visited their ship / and passid this day with litill plaisir. for the king
Oetes made hem no chere This notwithstand wha^ the night was come Jason went
unto the fair Medea and told to her how he made his request to the king Oetes
her fader. And how he had a^swerd to the regard of their marriage: and how he
was deperted from him. whereof the fair Medea was meruaylloussy soroufull and
sore troubled thinking on many things. But wha^ she had well bethought her
considering her cas and her affair / she made right good chere to jason as
she that abandon^ed her all unto his plaisir / and so it is to be supposed
that this night they leye to geder / and more say I not for this p^sent as
towching their faites of love /

In this night the fair Medea took all the most richest jeweles and bags
portatif that the king oetes her fader had. And she put and trussed them in a
fardell / and when hit came alitill to fore day she made jason to rise /
which was anon^ ready / And then^e when she was all ready she took with her
all the rychesses: and also her young brother absirthius of the aage of xvj.
months. whom she took secretly in a chamber from the nouryce. and made her
maistresse to cut his throat pryuely for certain causes / which shall here
after be declared: After this the fair medea and her maistresse cladd hem and
disgulsed them in man's habyte. and by the noble preu jason they were brought
unto the ship: And as soon as jason had deliuerid the^ in guard unto master
maronner Argos: he returned into his chamber til it was day abiding his
felawship Hercules Theseus Mopsius and many other knights that came with him /
at the blowing of an hor^a^d with that he took his flees of goolde / and said
to them that he would depart from thens with all dylygence for certain
causes. and without more sayng at this time he took his way to the end that the
other knights of greece should follow / And went so far that he e^trid i^ to
this ship. so well at apoynt that all his men entrid with him: And then^e the
maro^ners disancred and began to row by force of oores for asinoche as (...)
blewe not. and the wind helped he^ not by cause hit was calm: and thus in
this point they put them on the way unto the son rising / And at that
propre hour wha^ they were not withdrawn past a mile from the poorte: hit
happend by adventure that Argos the master maro^ner began to look toward the
poorte and he saw that on all sides hit was fulle of people After this he saw
ano^ and apperceyueyd that four lityll ships at faco^n of Balingers
orgaleyes subtle departed to gydre from the poorte / from whens that they they
came Whereof the good patron Argoshadde much great meruaille / And he wiste not
what to thenke / he was so encombred / For he* had well seen that / when the
noble Preu Jason and his company entrid into his ship: that the king his
baron^s ne the ladies had not conveyed him / He had great meruaille / but he
said not one word

How the king Oetes fader of Medea advertised of the departing of Jason and his
daughter Medea followed. And how Medea cast her brother Absirthyus by pieces
into the sea doubting her fader the king Oetes / And how the noble Queen
ysiphyle fylle down from an high montayn^ into the sea.


WHo that demands of thise four litill galeyes snbtill for what cause they
moved fro the port. And what people were inn: the history answerth / that
their entencyo^ was to come after the knights of greece And the king Oetes was
in one of them accompanied of four honderd men / which were all bourgeyses
of the toun^ that he had made to be armed* For asmoche as he was acertayned
that his daughter medea was goon^ with jason / and I shall tell you / This
king Oetes as said is. had been sorrowful and anoyed all the day precedent
fo^de him self so full of melancolye that he could not sleep ne rest / Alleway
after many thoughts and precogitacio^s he concluded in him self that he would
goo and conueye Jason at his departing to this end. that he comen into Greece
should preyse him and say. that he had made hi^ good chere. For to bri^ge to
an e^de this conclusion. he aroos and wyllyng to e^tre fro chamber to chamber
til he came to jason / he entrid in to the chamber of the nourice of his sone
absirthius* whom he fond not with his nourice that slepte / whereof he was sore
abasshid and awaked the nourire. and after demanded her. where was his dear sone
absirthius / And then^e the nourire began to look about her / but that was for
naught for she fond h^ not / wherefore all effrayed she spra^g out of her bed
/ and began to seche him diligently all aboutes / and the king Oetes entered in
to the chamber o^ Medea / and there he fond ne person ne his daughter ne her
that had governed her long time

When the king Oetes fond not his daughter Medea. he was so angry that his
blood changed / and withouthe spekyng any word / he went up in to the chamber
where the noble Jason was logged. but he fond neither jason ne Medea ne
person to whom he might speak. and for so much he departed suddenly and went
unto the poorte where he fond many of his citezeins that showed him the ship /
where the greeks were in. which was at that time from the poorte more then^ a
quater of a mile / then^ the king weping terderly demanded them if they had
seen his daughter medea and they answerde nay. Ha a fair sirs said then^ the
king: The traictres of greece have wyhtdrawe^ her wit words traitorously in
somoche as they have deceived her and brought her into their ship: and yet that
more is have so evil cou^ceylled her that she has born^ with her my sone
absirthius / O evil daughter / o the evil fortuned child / Certes medea thy
great disloyaulte constrayneth me that with force of people j will goo inco^tinet
fecche the for to wete who has meuyd the thus to do: and wit this I shall take
vengean^ce of the desloyall knight jason wiche to his power re^dreth to me evil
for good.

Wha^ the king had said thus he returned into his palace crye^g that every man
should arm him: and then^e all the people pourueyed them of staue ^ and
armures / and syn demanded whereof proceeded the cause of this alarom^e. the
which anon^ was all commune. Then^e they put them on the ^ way for to go unto
the king: which came and issued ont of his palace armed. and in point for
tentre into bataill. Then^e he went unto the poorte and chese out four ho^derd
of the best in po^t for to put in to the said four galeyes / and finably wha^
he had do^ all this he meuyd fro the poorte as said is / and with all haste
made his galeyes to be rowed after the knights of Greece: in such wise as the
master maronner apperceyued that tho galeyes came swiftely after the^ for to
fecch again the fair medea. and called jason that japed and played with medea:
present his felawe hercules: and she wid to him the four galeyes armed /
wherein was the king Oetes and his men well in point which approced fast. For
the galeyes were light: and jason seeing his encombrance approach. called
Hercules which knew nothing hereof and demanded him counceyll Then^e Hercules
ansuerde to him that he knew none other remedy / but that every man should
put him to arms and be ready tabyde the battle if hit were need: and auowed
unto the gods that if the king oetes made any enterprise upon the^ / that he
would put to death as many as he mygh^ arethe.

With thise words and with out le^ger ^aryeng the noble knight hercules and
jason put them in arms / and in like wise did their felawes Then^e Medea
and her maistresse sprang upon the planck of the ship. for to behold the king
and his galeyes. And anon^ after Jason and hercules all i^ arms came up on hye
by Medea and each with a sword in his fyste / And Medea began to tremble for
fere. wha^ she had espied her fader to approach so nyghe / at the^de the king
Oetes poursie wed so sore the ship of the noble preu jason by force of oores.
that er. they were out of the goulf or braas of the sea. that there was no more
distance fro on to an other but two bow shote. Then^ the fair Medea / seeing
that is was time to bring to end that she had begon^e to fore / said to her
maistres in weeping tenderly. My good mod where is my little brother absirthius /
give him to me. Then^ the evil oolde woman opend her lap and vnwonde the
body of the child / whom she had smyte^ into pieces. Medea took the heed and
list it an high / whereof Hercules jason and other seeing this had great horror
of this cruelte. and weresore abashed. nevertheless wha^ the preu Jason
apperceyued this he would know fro when^ came this creature so deed: And said
to Medea in this manner. My dear love what have ye in your thought. and what
will ye don with this so malerous and pyteus child

My dear love answerde then^e Medea: Thexperience of my work enseigneth to you
the thought of my heart. Madame answerde then^e the noble preu jason: what is
this child that I see here thus detrenched and smyten in pieces. certes he is
in an evil hour born^. that thus myserabli has finysshed his days / My dear
love answerde then^e the fair medea This is absirthius my young brother Know ye
that he is not malerouse. but is ewrous and happy: for this day / he shall be
cause of the sauacion of the life of his fader. and of his men^ and then^e he is
much ewrous and in a good our born^: wha^ he in his te^dre yongth may
because of the health of so much people and specially of his fader naturel:
Certes medea said then^e jason I see none other faco^n ne moyen but that ye be
of all points dishonored wha^ ye have co^mysed so right pyetousa caas. as for
to have m^rdryd your propre brother innocent of all things / A hawhat horrible
cruelte / My dear love answerde then^e medea: ne troble you other wise then^e
by reso^ For if it be your plaisir ye shall here what I shall say. and after of
the caas I make you judge. ye know how I am by you brought from the how^ of my
fader against his will / I have co^siderid what my departyngis. and further more
I have thought and have had regard unto the great and meruaillous courage of
my fader. and al thing over thought and considerid that I could not withdraw me
fer but he should be advertised / for he has of custom that every morenyng er
he goo doun^ he will see his sone and me also: I have jmagyned that anon^ as he
fyndeth not me ner his sone: that withonte fault he will come after me in arms
like as ye see he does / and thus when I have all thise things considered and
the great danger that might ensiewe to us that for me should be the bataill
mortal between you and him in which without remedy he should be slayn^ or
taken by his hye vaylliau^ce seen that unto de^h he would abandonne him self
for to recouuere me. and to the end teschewe more great paryll and dommage for
him I have taken his owen sone / which is my brother. and have commanded to put
hi^ in the state as ye see for to cast at this time abroad i^ to the course of
the sea here and there And to give empechement unto the ship of my fader /
which then^e shall tarry wha^ he shall see his sone absirthius thus disme^brid
flotyng upon the water. for to guard and recuyelle the pieces as ye shall seen
plainly anon^.

With thachieueme^t of these devises the king oetes approached in such manner
the ship of the greeks that there was no more distan^ce but a stone cast /
Then^e the fair medea and the old woman filled their hands with the membris
of the noble child absirthius / in showing them to the king oetes and his men^
/ For as soon as the oolde queen sspy^d the king she escryed these words
following and said thus / King in no wise come no nere wenyng to recouure thy
sone ne thy daughter. As to the regard of thy daughter / thou losest thy time.
for she is married unto jaso^. But at lest we shall re^dre to the thy sone
slain and detre^ched by pieces. the which we cast into the sea to the^de that
thou may have thy life saved: for but If he cansed the to have occupacion for
to recuyelle his propre members for to do burye the^ as hit apperteyneth to the
sone of a king know thou that thou sholdest have the bataill against the
knights of greece which ben of so hye vaylliaunces that there ne is anymal
monstre serpent ne tyran^t but that they bring to destruc^yon: then^e hit
ought to be bileuyd that the victory of the bataill should abide with them. and
certes thou sholdest receive thy death. so all thing well ouersee^ hit is
better to the that thou return unto the cite then^e tapproch more ner for to
receive thy death. and well ought thou to have great yoye for to see thy happy
sone be ded and detrenched by py^ces / by the which thy life is respyted / for
thou art not very ne naturell fader. if thou take not his membre^ out of the sea / and if thou so do thy life shall be saved and all they of thy company.

WIth these words the old woman and Medea cast in the sea the members of the
young child absirthius / and the king Oetes and his people heeryng and seeing
the great inhumanite and cruelte began to escrye right pyetoussy: and
dolorous^i. And were so sore vexed and trobled of this meruaillous aue^ture:
that they wist not what to do / some there were that began to weep tenderli. the
other smote them self on the breasts / and some began to array hem to goo to
bataylle / and escryed to death the knights of greece shoting on the^ arowes and
other trait by great courage for tanenge them / but when the king saw that ^ no
wise he might recouure the death of his dear sone: he made to cesse the
escarumssij and said to his cytezels / certes fair siresj pray you to travail
you no more for to recouure medea: shehath murdrid her propre brod absirthius
which was my sone / and he that ^ time to come should have be^ your naturell
lord / certes j have louid wit all my heart her all her life that wit her
dissoyall will has brouht to me one so dolorouse guerdon^ or reward Ha a meda
said the king all on high j shall never sech ne desire to mete wit the for
cause of so cruel and disnaturell a deed that* thou have ^ my sed to thy
propre blood. and therefore fay^ lords late her and all them that been with her
goo where the gods will suffer hi^: but know ye for certain that if j now
had her at my liberte I should make her to deye a cruel: death: how well that
should sourdre thereof to me a new sorrow / wherefore hit is better that she goo:
and that we ente^de to reassemble the me^bres of my sone which flote^ as ye
may see upon the wawes of the sea / to the end that his flesh be not pasture
to the birds

Wha^ then^e the nobles and bourgeyses of the cite understood their king all
they began to sech the members of absirthius iudemenyng the most great sorrow
of the world: and thus they disposed them to complaire the king and no more
tassayle their enemies. And when they had fysshed the members of the child
they retora^d unto the cite by space of time right sorrowful and disconforted
for the death of Absirthius: and for asmoche as medea also was goon^ with jason
Medea was then^e well joyous and more assured then^ to fore: when she
apperceyuid that her fader and his me^ tarried for to fisshe the me^bres of his
sone / Certes jason seeing this that said is / wist not what to think. and
Argos the good maronner rowed all way in withdrawing from the poorte and the
isle of Colchos as much as he might in so much that in alytil while he had
lost the sight of the king Oetes and of his galeyes. and that he came into the
hyhe see: where the wind blewe and aroose that anon^ they desployed their sail
which they wo^de^ up an high / wherefore the ship made good way. whereof argos
was much yoyous / and then^e he said that every man might leye doun^ his
harnoys freely promysing them to be out of all paril^ for that time. Jason at
this time was right pensyf for the cruelte and inhumanyte that he had seen this
day and spak not one word / and seemed by co^parison^ more triste then^e
joyous. and not without cause: When medea had understand that Argos assewryd
all the company for that time from all parils that they had been in. was thoo
conforted greatly / but she beheld her hands that yet were all foul of the
blood of her brother Absuthius: she went and washed hem and made hem clean.
and after she ca^ and set her doun^ by Jason. and seeing that he was much
pensyf / said to hi^ by a gracious and curtays manner / My dear love whereon
think you Certes jason answerde not one word And when she saw that / she
said to hi^: again the same word: My dear love jason whereon think you. Then^
Jason answerde to her thus. Lady syn that ye desire to know whereon I think.
know ye for troth that if it were not for the great love that I have in you
and for that I have promised to wed you and bring you into Greece. I would not
do it / wherefore keep from henssorward that ye do no such thing as dear as ye
will have pees between you and me / Upon thise words Medea excused her the
fairest wise she could and was to her possible Sayng that all this that she
had don was of very good will in somoche as she so doing supposed that to
have used cruelte ne humanyte ne of hayne or hate precedent. and that in the
night tofore the goddess Deane had showed and made reuelacyon to her that king
/ Octes must needs dey or absirthius his sone for him And by such words in
colouri^g her caas she traueyled so sore that she found her self in the godod
grace of jason.

During this voyage when they had be^ certain days on the sea. mopsius came on
a time to Jason and theu^ brought to his remembran^ce hou he had promised to
ysips^le to return by the cite of Lennos / upon which jason answerde that he
said troth and that he would hold his promise So he spak to hercules to
Theseus and to the master argos. which were glad hoping to make good chere in
that cite: But when medea knew that jason had promised and would god theder:
for to see the queen jsiphile as hi behooved / she and her maistresse ordained
their sorts and their enchantements in a secret place which were of such
virtue. that when Argos wend to take his way by an arm^ of the sea which
gooth sirait to lennos: his gouernaile brak i^ more then^e a thousand pieces.
and by a wind much subtle the ship was in continent turned and brought all
in tho pposite to theniencion of the noble knight and his company / wherefore
all they that were in the ship / were right soroufull reseruid Medea and her
old maystresse: which were at their ease

The queen Ysiphile was upon a high roche being upon the sea side: not far
from Lennos at the point when the noble preu Jason passed forth by as said is:
And she acustomed daily to hold her and awayte there right sore desiring to see
Jason. on whom was all her thought and desir. and somoche loved him that she
be wayled him from the morn^ unto the even upon this roche and sind often times
thise propre words that follow: Ha a Neptunus god of the sea and of the
winds. where is my dear love jason. Bring him again to me / Render him again
to her that day and night wepeth and lygheth after him ded or alive I will
have him. and Ipraye you that ye will send me this grace and ewer lever this
day then^e to morn^. Thus then^e as she was all disco^forted one day among
all other she looked into the sea toward the cest. and saw from far the ship
much desired that sailed by a great radour and a fulle saill where jason was
in Certes she knew it anon as well by the gretenes as by the baners and
enseignes that were displayed with the wind / Whereof she had so great
gladness that she began to make the best chere of the world / But as she was
thus rauysshed in great joy / and that her seemed that jason ca^ seuerly unto
her. With that the old maistresse and the fair medea put their sorceries to
work and their e^cha^teme^ts: whereof thaue^ ture of the ship sorted as said
is / for she turned al suddenly at that other cost* whereof the pour jsiphile
was all abashed and sore esmayed. Instead to make yoye she was constrained to
weep great teeres / and instead of syngyng / she was enforced to complain /
What shall I say more as sodaynli as the ship turned / so suddenly changed
the manner of ysiphi le / she abode there and passed that night and did do make
fyres and light of many fagotys: for to redress Jason and Argos to her ward /
thynkyng that without fault jas^ would come unto her / and she abode in this
place by the space of vj. wekes: weping / waking and contynuelly bewayling
jason: whom she loved more then^e her propre heart

Wan the six wekes were past and that the fair jsiphyle apperceyued that she
should have no tydinges of her love Jason. for thenchanteme^tes of medea and of
her maistresse made that that the ship of Jason might not approach the isle
of Lennos / The right disco^forted Isiphile seeing that said is / as upon the
point as full of despayr. she departed^ from the roche where she had been long
abydyng: and in a meruaillous opynyo^ she returned to lennos / And then^e mhan
she was entered into her chamber she made her sone to the brought to her / whom
she kyssed many times for the love of Jason. and after began to think and
contrepeyse in her mind i^ diuerce manners / and then^e wha^ she had long
thought by great habo^da^ce of melancolye: she said in beholding her child and
crossing her arms with a sighe coming from the boro^ of her heart. Alas my dear
sone: alas that thou can not* speak for to dema^de me tydinges of thy fader:
which is the most fair knight: the most virtuous / and the most vaylliaunt
in arms that the godd ever fourmed If thou coudest speak and demand me of him
I might well answer to the / but how. alas I wot never for at al aue^ture he
daygneth not to come. and at adventure wha^ he weneth to come as that other
day. me seemed wha^ j knew his ship / who^ the wind and tempest constrained
to return and to sail all at thopposite / in shewi^g me his bak: and in
traversing the wawes and flothes of the sea so ^petuous^ that j think better
that he isperisshed then^ not: For in forty days that j have syn soyourned on
the roche / j ne could never see him again: whereof j am right displaisant in my
heart

My dear sone then^e where is now nature which should enseigne the to weep.
and me more then^e the: after the loss of one so desired prince / ought j more
desire to live. What may it auaylle me to live: Certes if I should live / my
life should be from he^s forth full of co^tynuell bewaylinges of dolours / of
wepinges / and of sighs / o what sorrow: I wot no more to say I have somoche
loved jason that perdurably I am constrained to weep after him / how be it all
way the creatures ne desire to live but for to enjoy the worldly plaisan^ces:
and then^e when all mondayn pleysir faylleth what ought j desire: js this a
life. certes nay And what then^ / hit is a life that lives deyeng: and a death.
that lives in languisshinge: O meruaillous and right terrible desire / j shall
deye verayly in this yourneye Hit is concluded: For what som^e ever shall or
may come thereof. j shall spri^ge in to the hye see: To the end that if the noble
preu jason be there buried that j may be with him in sepulture And to the end
also / that if he be not dedy that the sea that brought him hither a live may
bring me to him a live or deed. but first er I commyse this meruaillous and
dolorous caas I shall compyle an epistle which shall be sewed unto my vestime^ts
or clothes / To this entencion. that if jason live yet j have an hope that the
gods shall do me be presented tofore him. and then^e by this mine epistle he
shall know of what excellent love and courage I have loved him

Many ladies and damoyselles were in the company of ysiphile theu^e when she
had (...) wayled her dear love jason: And also the conclusion as she that was
desperate should lepe and spring into the sea. All they began to demene great
sorrow meruaillously and not without cause. Sum there were that were jnly
sorrowful that they could not speak o word. Other were there drowned in teeris
that enforced hem to reconforte her and for to let and distourne her fro this
dampnable will / but that was for naught* for they lost her pain. for asmoche
as ysiphile wrote herepisile / which she wrapped i^ a cered cloth and syn
sewed hit unto her roke of cloth of goold which she clad her with. and when
she had so do she took her crown and set hit on her head fermely. and after
took her scepter / And then^ wha^ she had done all this. she came to her sone
and kissed him many times and reco^manded him unto the ladies and damoiselles /
And last when she had taken leave of all the women^ she deperted from le^nos
the Cite weeping tenderly. and took with her one of her damoyselles: by who^
where known afterward all her bewailinges / lamentacions and all her manners
that she held to fore she cast her self into the sea

THan she was comen nygh unto the sea: she approached unto an hye roche / to
who^ the sea touched beneth a far low doun^: she began to behold a low and
se the sea / And after she stracched her self on the earth in beholding the
heaven and the sea. and said. Very god lord. of the sea / of winds. of
tourbillons and of fortunes. of raynes and of te^pestes / ye brought into this
country. and into this place the tyght parfayt knight: in beauty / in
vayllyaunce: and in all virtues Jason / and after ye sent him in to the isle
of Colchos / and consequently ye have: she wid me from far his ship and ^yn
ye have drowned him / or atleste lad him into another country And when it i^ so
/ that I may by no way have none other thing of him / I you require that ye
will make my sepulture by him / if he have made the passage out of this
world. and if he be on live that ye will conduite me into his presence: for
hit must needs be / and other thing j demand not of you: And when the desolate
queen Isiphile had said thise words she returned her unto the Cite: and said
in this manner al on high and clear voys

ADyeu my dear child. adyeu Lennos the noble cite: adieu ladies and
damoiselles / and syn she returned her unto the sea. and cryeng Jason Jason.
She spra^g fro the sommet or top of the roche into the high see / And there
drowned her self in sorrow. whereof was great pity But her fortune was such that
on that same day the sea bare the body unto the ship of the noble preu jaso^
abydyng yet inthe see in a rood where they were ancred for to rest there that
night: At this our when the pour ysiphyle was cast against the ship /
Hercules and jason went up on high for to take the air Then^e they
perceived the desolate body so rychely arrayed that the cloth of gold shone by
the disgorgeme^ts of the watre: anon as they had seen this they called argos
their master maronner and showed to him. anou^ argos callid some of his solke
and made them to fisshe and draw out of the sea / and to bring into the ship
that pour creature so rychely habylled with Royal atours* and wha^ she was
drawn on high. all they in the ship went up. for to see the body of this
noble lady: And Medea faylled not to come with the other for to be hold this
pity. Certes the deed lady had her vysage swollen and pale that none in the
ship knew her / But at the coming and for the presence of the old woman. she
v^yed blood by the conduyte of her mouth / as hit had been a little rennyng
water departing from a fontayne or a spring. whereof all they had great
meruaille.

when Argos the good maro^ner saw the meruaille he stouped doun^ for to put
upon her roobe a clothe for to keep it from the fowlyng of the blood that
departed from her mouth. And as he put the cloth about her nek he apperceyued
the cered cloth that kept the water from the pistle that she had compiled.
wherefore for to know what it was / he distached or rypte it of and deliuerid
hit to jason Then^ the knight received the cloth and opende hit and found the
episile. and disployed it and as he red it and understood the contenu of the
same his blood began to change and he wax read as a rose. and after beca^
pale and deed as ashes / and syn began to weep and to demene a sorrow much
aygre and sharp / Certes the fair medea Hercules Theseus and the other
knights of gerce were sore abas^^^d so were argos and the maro^ners / wha^
they apperceyued that jason demened so great adueil and sorrow. Then^e it was
demanded from whens this sorrow came: and what tidinges he found and had by the
contenu of the lettre but it was for naught For he might not speak ner a^swere
his heart was so closed and strained wit anguissh and sorrow / notwihsta^dyng
wha^ he had redd it and seen the co^ten^ of the pistle He deliuerid it to
medea: and the co^teynyng thereof was this that follows

Jason Jason the chosen of greece in prowess / in beauty / and in virtues where
art thou / And when shall thou hold thy promise unto her / that always has
her eyes planted on the sea after the: desiring to see again the body
bytamorouse desires: and by moo bewaylynges than the heaven conteyneth sterres.
A ha my dear love. have thou put in no recchig ner no challoy^ the promise
that thou me made at that time when thou wentest to Colchos. know not thou
well that every man of noble name or vocacion is holden and bounden to pay and
hold his promise / upon pain of reproach. thou have promised to me. the day
of thy promise is passed. Thou acauytest the not. O so grievous a shame and
large reproach. ye if. thou have not lauful ^x^n^acyon. Syn the day of thy
promise exspired / I never entrid into house for to take plaisir ne to cover me
to be dry: I have not leyd on bed to take my rest. I have not seten a table
for to ete / Ne j have not ben in p^toire for to judge the causes of my woe men^
/ but I have the space of xl. days awayted upon a roche where I was when thou
entredest into my royaume / And that famyne ^strained the to take land: There
have I hold me day and night / in the rayn^ in the wind. in the cold of the moon and in the heete of the son: In fastinges / in prayers and oroison^s. in
souffrages. in thoughts: in jmaginacyons / in desire / in hope / and fynably
in despair and in death anguisshous For wha^ I have apperceyued that thou canist
not again to me. in fourthy days after the day of thy promis All dispayred I
have compiled and wreton this epistle wyh my hands and with thyn. and in all
such wise and faco^n as she that might no longer abide thy coming and reforne
/ j have cast my self into the sea prayng the gods. that they bri^ge me quyk
or deed in to that place there thou art quyk or ded. by great deffanlte of thy
promise / and to that e^de that thou see what terible affection and love j
have had to thy perfone.

In redyng this epistle. the preu jaso^ wept so pyetoussy that he might no
more: And as to the regard of hercules Theseus and Mopsius they faylled not to
be of the lyuery of Jason. And when Medea had red all the conten^ of the pistle.
jason began to complayue this so miserable lady that was deed by his cause* as
she declared in her epistle. And then^e when he had co^playned and be wayled
her long: he excused him to fore them al le of the promise that he had made to
her for to return by the Cite of Iennos. Sayng that it was not his deffaute /
but that the god of wind was coul^able. And thereof he took witness of Hercules
Theseus and mopsius / Argos the good ^ato^ner and of many other / the which
^^ew right well how he had purposed to have gon^ into le^nos i^ retorni^g from
hise^terpryse from Colchos for to see this noble lady and how the tourbyllon^s
of wind had destourned he^ against his will. But finably wha^ medea apperceyued
the manner of jason. she began to dema^de him. what prouffited hi^ his wepinges
and such excusacio^s: and syn said to him. Certes Inson me seems that ye
have better the courage of a woman then^e of a man. and that is no need to weep
ne so bewailc a lady that was so despaired: but right welfor your honor and
for the goodness that she has done for you and in ^passyon of noblesse: ye
shall do her to be adoubed for to bring her i^to your country / and there ye
shall do her richely and honourahly be put in sepulture. as in such a caas
apperteyneth

By the words and remo^strau^ces of the fair Medea: the duiel and sorou of her
love jason cessed a lytil and a l^^yll and Medea with her maistresse wha^ they
saw her time took the body of the Qnene ysiphile and leyde it a perte with the
atours ryalle. What shall I make long process on the moru^. Iaso^ commanded to
disancre from thens And was syn sailing certain iourneyes on the sea / but in
the end without maki^g me^cio^ of any aue^ture dig ne of memory / Argos the
good maistre sailed so far bigousfres and bifsotes that at the. xx. month
after their deperting of mirmidone he arrived at the poorte from whe^s he was
de^ted / for whose coming the dwellars (...) inhabytants of that country of
greece were as yoyouse as they might be / and on that otherside jason and all
they of his ship incontinent as they had espied and known that is was the
poorte that they weredeperted fro / began to singe al on in preysing and
tha^king the gods of that. they were comen home and had escaped so many
daungiers and parils to their worship and prouffit with right grere triumph of
victory

At that time when argos arrived in this poort / the sterres apperid largely on
the heaven / the night was fair and the sea paysible / And therefore the knights
of greece abode i^ the ship al night without going alonde. and on the morn^ be
time jason se^te Theseus for to signefie his coming unto Peleus / Theseus went
and fond peleus in a cite named Elsebee: where was merry and passed the time
with his wife whose name was Cy^ane. and supposed never to have herd tydinges of
jason and wha^ peleus saw and knew theseus he went against him and made to him
great reverence and worship / and syn demanded him of all tydinges: Then^e
theseus began to tell a part of the tydinges of jaso^ and in especial
recompted to him thauenture that he had done in Colchos: and how he had brought
the rich and noble flees of gold: and that he was arrived at the poorte of
seseyre / and that he had with him the flees which was the most fair and the
most noble Jewel / that ever was seen. and after told him that he had
conquered in hy^ voyage the grettest honor that ever knight might get. and
also he told how he brought with him the daughter of the king of Colchos.
which was most wise fair* and exellente / which in all qualitees after reason
might be holden for the best acco^plisshid lady of the world: The noble knight
Peleus hering these tidings thus told: was so pressid at the heart / that all the blood changed* by all the veins os his body. how well he made semblant as
he had be^ meruaillousli yoyous. for he sent unto the king Eson for to she we
to him these good tidings: and syn assembled the nobles the bourgeys / the
merchants. the ladies and damoiselles of the cite: and brought them in fair
ordenan^ce for to mete with Jason

when the coming of jason was ^^owen in the cite and in the country ^^he man
began to make great chere At comyug out of the ship Iaso^ and Hercules were
the first that issued out. and after them came mopsius and an other knight of
greece. which bare to fore jason the rich flees of gold in sign of triu^phe
and of victory. The three to^ges of the meruaillous dragon / the legs and
horns of the two dredefull boles / and they led by the arm the noble lady
Medea. which was rychely arrayed and fair as the fair day / and after them
followed the other knights and noble me^ of greece / Inco^tine^t as peleus and
the ge^tyll men of his route saw the noble flees that was so rich. and the
great beauty of Medea. they were all ameruaylled: they made to the^ the
reverence first And with great honor and glory brought jaso^ to elsebee the
cite. where they soiourned that night. and on the morn^ they deperted thens and
went to pintaquo. where the king Eson soyourned at that time. For asmoche as
that place was set in a good air. and all about had great deduyt of chaas
and hon^ting meraillously of venerie

Pyntaquo was a fair strong castle standing upon a great Ryuere and broad
which ran^ swiftli round about the place: and with this hit was enuiro^ned
with fair and parfon^de forestes. of good land erable and fair meadows
plente. Certes the good king was much reioyed / and not with out cause when
he apperceiued and saw his noble sone jason and the fair medea his lady / the
rich flees of gold. the three to^ges of the marvelous dragon^: and the horns
and legs of the two meruaillouse boles. for to content each man / wha^ he
had made the reverence unto the king his fader and to the other nobles. he
declared all plainly in the halle: that he had never comen to the chief of
this conqueste / ne had been the counceylle the aid and adresse of Medea which
was there present / and therefore said he: j have reno^ced the love of my lady
Mirro: and have promised to this lady that she shall be my wife and my felaw: and
thus I will espouse and wed her at the third day / wherefore I pray all noble
men and other ladies and damoiselles. that each person do to her honor as it
apperteyneth to do unto a noble lady

when Peleus had vnderstande^ that the fair Medea had been cause that Jason was
comen* to the above of his enterprise without danger of death / and that
without the aid of her he had been devoured / he changed color and becam all
deed. and as well advised said naught thereto / but alwai for to hold jason in
love he said to hi^ / that he would take the charge for to make the fest / and
furthermore he would se^de for to pray his parentis and friends for to be
thereat: Among thise things the preu jason sent Theseus and Mopsius unto the
poorte of deseire and charched them expressly. that they should go and bury
with all solempnite and reverence the body of the noble queen Isiphile. The
two knights went with good heart / and acquyted them of this charge / For
tabregge the history Cypriane had in guard the fair medea unto the day that
jason had set for tespouse. Castor polux and Nestor with many rich Dukes
came then^e to pintaquo: what shall I make long reher saille jason espoused the
fair medea after the law that time used in greece with much great honor and
reverence. As in any wise to him was possible a doun^. For he did to her
asmoch great honor as lady might receive The feste was noble and fair. and hit
was full and plenteuously served of all things / But of the metes and
entremetes and with how many course and how many disshes at every course there
were seruid. I will make no mencyon at this time. But thus much will I say
that Peleus Cypriane and her daughters made right great po^pes And peleus
ordained this feste su^ptuous and costlewe of rich metes. and beuurages or
dri^kes The day passed and the feste in daunces. carolles and es^atements /
The even came and after the night that Jason and medea lay to geder: Always this
feste endured. xv. days hole: and during this feste / the noble and rich
slees of gold was ordynantly hanged up in the halle in the sight of all the
world / and there might come every man that would to behold hit by great
admyracio^ / And there came people so far and nigh in such multitude that hit
seemed a very percession. for which cause Jason was meruayllously renommed in
many a country / for his hygh^ vasselage and for this so glorious conqueste

AT the end of.xv. days / and of the hye solempnite of these espousaylles as
the noble princes Baron^s and noble men were upon the point for to retonre to
their con^trees. Jason and hercules assembled them and there recou^ted to them
the rudesse that the king Laomedon^ had done to Jason / and to the knights
of this company / in reffusing to them fresshe water and vytaylle for their
money For the which cause they had been in danger and paril of death. Then^e
the princes and varon^s of greece heering the great doleance of jason and
Hercules: permised prestly and swore that they would avenge this deffaulte and
^mu^ie They were aspre. hoot and hasty i^ vengeance And after these couenau^tes
thus made. they gaf charge to Argos to make and set up an honderd ships of
war / for to bring fyfty thousand men^ to fore Troy: or at lest forty
thousand / Argos that was well connyng in that work enterprysed the charge.
and promised that with in three year all these ships should be ready to help
hem And wha^ they had take a conclusion upon all thise things. and that they
had made to Medea all the honor and / reverence of the world: by space of
time they departed all thens. and every man returned into his country leuyng
Jason and the fair Medea in their rest

perEleus went unto Elsebee and bare dueyll and rancon^ in his courage more
then^e need was / for somoch^ as he saw jason so triu^phe / and that he knew
not how he might make him to deye. And Jason which intended to nothing saving
to make his plaisir. let him yet govern his Royaume. and so acquitte him in
the debt of marriage against the fair medea in such fao^n / that she conceived
of him a right fair sone. which at the end of ix. mo^thes was deliuerid and was
named jason after his fader / The king Getes fader of medea came then^e to
Pintapuo with a prive meyne and litill company. as he that loved Medea like as
the fader loves the child: And when he understood and knew the great honor
that the preu jaso^ had done to her / he was content with him and with his
daughter And without exploiting of any other thing he returned into his
country much yoyous: And hit was not long after these things thus befalle^
that the old maistresse of medea departed out of this world and deyde. But
when it came unto the article of deth^ / she taught Medea a great part of the
art of nygromancye and of many other sciences where in she was expert And
also she taugh^t her among other sciences and art and craft for to make old
people to become young of the aage of.xxxij. year. But the life and destynee for
to deye might not be lengthid unto such persons by the virtue of the science
ne other wise: for asmoche as it is predestinqcion naturell

How Medea changed the king Eson in to young aage. And of the death of Peleus


After the death of the maistresse of the fair Medea / Jason demanded Medea.
wha^ thought best to ddo. She answer^e to him: that she had lost great
felauship and priuaulte by the death of her maistresse To whom the noble preu
jason ansuerde and said / that there was nothing so certain for every creature
as the death And that the gods would take her soul. After many days medea
took head that among all other sciences she had one for to make old people to
become young and specially men. And syn she beheld also that the good king Eson
was passing ancient and old / for which cause she considered that she myt
get a great loos and an hye reno^^ice. if she renewed his aage / wherefore she
called on a day her lord jason and said to him that by her sciences she could
do somoche that his fader the good king Eso^ should recouure new youth in
such wise as he should seem non older but.xxxij. year old: Wha^ jason
understood this that said (...) he meruaillously abasshid and not without cause
/ but how well that him seemed a thing ipossible whereto he gaf no faith yet he
ansuerde and said to her Certes fair lady I knosaide to her. Certes fair lady
I know for troth that ye are right wise and well eyperime^ted in ple^te of hye
sciences / ye can much more then^ all other ladies and damoiselles / but yet
this seems a much and a great thing to do so as ye say to me / and I would it
plesed the gods now that your science might stracch^ into so hye a matere for
somoche as that should be to me a right great well. For I would that my fader
might live so long that he should put me in my sepulture: without abregyng or
shortyng of my time: ye know well that every man desires to live

By all my gods sire a^swerde the lady ye shall well know that for no thing
I will abuse ne deceive you / But I declare you for troth. that for to lenghte
the life of your fadere the king longer then^e the gods and nature has
ordained by lymitacyo^ of time: as touching that I will not touch / for my
science may not furnisshe that. But as to the regard for to reduce his yo^gth^
in such wise as he shall seem to you and all other in the aage of xxxij. year /
I will make me strong so to do if it be your playsir and his / Madame a^swerde
then^ jason I am asfor my self more then^e content / and pray you thereof with
all my heart / But we must go unto the king my fader and declare to hi^ all
the fayte for to here his oppynyo^ With these words jason brought the fair
Medea unto the king Eso^ his fader. And declared to him the good will that
medea had toward him Sayng that if he would consent thereto and ay de him self
that she should make him young again and brig hi from his old age unto the aage
of xxxij. year / But as to the regard of the lengthing of your life other wise
then^e god and nature has ordained as to that she will nothing touch

When the noble and ancient king Eson had understand this that said is he
being set upon a couche. and resting his heed upon his arm which was white
and balled. he said unto medea: My fair daughter ye have been cause as I
understand that jason my sone is comen to his honor and prouffit and to his
above of his enterprise / and that wyth^out your councele / moyen and aid he
had been deed and devoured by the dredeful and horrible bestes that kept the
noble and rich moton^ or sheep of gold in the isle of Colchos. and as ye have
kept and saved his life in his yo^g ange flourisshing in virtues and valent.
will ye also save myn^ in my last days. for certes after the course of nature I
am at the brinke of my pytte or sepulture. and thus liyng a long time in the
vmbre or shadow of deth^ / I had lever to be and dwell in the world then^ to
part out thereof: for there is no thing that j desire somoche / when it shall be to
you possible as for to return me into the prosperity of yongthe and therefore my
fair daughter. if hit be in you or in your science to do this that ye have put
in terms by your moeuing and after by your word. j should be greatly holde^
unto you. and if it plese you to take the crown of my royaume. I shall give hit
unto you: without claymyng it euyr aft. My dear fader answerde medea. it is well
known that ye ar an hye prince garnisshed with good reno^me / of noble
conversation digne to bear the crown / wherefore as reason is your dignite shall
abide with you all your lyff and in favor of your seignoureuse ge^tilnesse /
ye yet er: ix. days be^ past j shall renew you as said is unto the age of
xxxij. year: and j shall not labor on no^ other matter unto the time that j am
come to the above of mine enterprise / which is no lytyl thing

Without mak^g of any delay the fair Medea took leave of her lord jason for
viij. days hole: and then^ she departed fro the palace. and went the most
secretly that she could all allone unto a great wood. and when the night was
comen / and that the moon shone bright and clear / she knelid do^n thries on
her knees / studyeng at ech^ time her science / syn lift up her visage unto the
heaven and made this oroiso^ that foloweth^ Moan reposing i^ the mids of the
sterres that shynest and confermest the charms. and ye the gods of
montaignes of the valeyes / of woods: of deserts: of the fontaynes. of sees /
of herbs / and of trees. beye in my begynnyug / and give me aid in my work
for the salute and health of king Eson. when she had said this she made
certain signs about her: and after she maad so^me secret inuocacyons. and
then^e she was lift up into the air and born^ into all the Regyons of the
world / Where she gadred and took many herbs of diuerce faco^ns and
conditions. and many precious stones: and was thus in point laboring by the
space of viij. days: And on the ix. day she was restablisshid in the same
wood and in the propre place from whe^s she was lift up into the air And
there she fond her self tofore a much rich temple that was t^ere dedyed unto
the goddess / Hebe and to the goddess Hekates

Hit was on the point of the day erly when Medea fo^de her self tofore the
temple / And then^ medea abode there all rauisshed unto the son^ne rising. and
then^e she entrid into the temple and made sacrefice unto the gods hebe and
hekates: Hebe was called goddess of yo^gthe and hekates of charmerye. When she
had done. thus she issued out of the temple. and did make a pytte in the
earth. and in this pit which was deep she sacrefied a black sheep unto the
gods of hell: of whom she held and kept the blood and medlyd it with the
herbs. And after that she was garnisshid of all that was needful for her
returned unto the old ancient king Eson. and did do make for him a fair
bayne / wheri^ she put these herbs / and milk and honey. and wha^ she had
prepared and made ready all that was for him necessary In the presence of
Jason she pnt the king into the baygne where the herbs begon^e to smell right
sweet / and ever more and more gaf good odor / And anon^ after that he was
therein. and that she had rubbed and froted him wyth^ the herbs / he fill a
sleep by her art. and when he was a sleep she made hi^ alytyll wound: where
out she drew his old blood / and left him in this point by the space of.
vij. hours. after this she awoke him and made him to issue out of the baygne
all naked hole and so^d of all his me^bres as he had been in the aage of two
an thretty year

When the preu Jason and the king his fader him self saw thexperie^ce of this
crast and mistere / Certes they had great meruayll and not without cause / for
this was a werck that never was seen ne happend to fore. And somoch^ preysed
the wit. the connyng: and the virtues of the fair medea: that they yuged her
to be inspired of the gods / Then^e the noble king Eson / when he fond
himself in this estate he sent for the best tailours and makers of garneme^ts
And did do make for his body all new habillements after the faco^n: that the
young men ware at that time. after this he went and put him to the chaas or
hu^ting and to deduyt of fawco^ns and hawks / to make esbatements festes:
daunces and tournoyes / ioustes and other plays / and for to short our matter
/ he so conduised hi^ self as a man made all new Hit was not long ofter that
Peleus and all the nobles of the country and other were advertised hereof.
Where fore great no^bre of people came to pintaquo only for to see the king E^on
that was strongly enclyned to singe dance and to do al yoyouse things And yet
that more is he saw gladly the fair damoyselles: and for to make short he
held hi^ self as a ^o^g Prince that had no regard sa^^ only to make good
chere and to pass the time yoyously

per Eleus / his wife Cypriane. and his daughters came unto the king i^ the
renouellyte of this noble respyrem^t Medea lay with Jason and conceived of him
a right fair sone of who^ she was deliuerid in good time. and anon after the
burth of this second sone / Cypryane came on a day to the fair medea and
required moc^ insta^tly that of her grace she would make young again Peleus.
which began strongly to wexe and old. Certes the fair medea was right yoyous
wha^ she saw her so required / and thi^king in her self that she would be
avenged of the disloyal peleus the which intended to have made jason be ded*
She accorded to her this reqneste and took day for to do hit: And wha^ the
day was comen Medea commanded to Cypriane that she should make ready a much
noble baygne After she sent for to fecche peleus whyc^ was much yoyous / for
so moc^ as he supposed to become young again like as he had been tofore. and
then^e when all was ready. peleus dispoylled him of his clothes and entered in to
the baygne. Medea made him to sleep there / And when he was a sleep she took to
his two doughteres to each a sword well trenchaunt in her hands / and made
hem to make on the body of peleus their fader moo then^e fyfty wou^des mortal.
Sayng that they must needs do so: and then^e when peleus was a doubed and hurt:
and that of his life was no remedy. Medea awoke him and said in this manner: Ha
a right unhappy traittre / thou sendest late jason into Colchos* wenyng for to
have made him deye there without any respyte: wherefore thou have deseruid the
death that shall be now this our inhumayn and by the hands of thy perpre
daughters. and therwyth Medea departed from the chamber. And peleus thus
myserably finisshed his life and his days

Wha^ Cypr^ane and his two doughtes were advertised of thise tydi^ges they
escryed much sorowfully. and in weeping great teeris in great anguysshe drew
out of the meruaillous baygne the pour body of peleus. and leyde hit a long
upon a table. but Ci: pr^ane had the heart so strayte shette that she might not
speak / and not without cause. For as soon as she had peleus upon the table.
she fill doun^ reuerssed all a swoumne / and then^e the daughters considering
the great meschief that was befall to the^ took the two swerdes yet all blood
with which they had put their fader to death / and smote the^ self to the heart
in such wise that they fill doun^ ded and despaired upon the bodi of their
soroufull mother / which then^ reui^ed out of her swou^me. A ha right pyetou^
and dolorous caas: Cypryane com^ again to her self and seeing in her p^sence
this meschief and redoublement of sorrow / could hold non^ other mayntene sauf
for to cry with all her puissa^ce also hye and ferdfulli that the king Eson
and his sone being ^ot fer fro^thens in a toure by the chamber: were greatly
afraid with this cry. And in especial when they beheld first the body of
peleus put upon the table al enuironned with wounds. Secondly wha^ they saw
and apperceiued the ij. young damoiselles daughters of peleus having stiked in
their bodies unto their hertes the swerd where wit they were slain. and
thirdly seeing cypryane lyyng upon the pauiment: her heart faylling cracching her
face and drawyng her here by great asprete of sorrow.

The king Eson and his sone jason seeing this that said is came then^e unto the
lady: and i^ approchyng releued her and leyde her on a bed that was there.
Then^e Jason began to doubt of Medea for asmoche as often times she had
required him that he would put to death peleus because he had sent hi^ into the
isle of colchos When thy had brought the lady on the bed. Eson the noble king
and his so ne jason began to reconforte her the best wise that they might. and
weeping tenderly they demanded her who had commysed this dolorous murdre: Then^e
the lady answerde wit^ much great pain that medea was culpable: and reherced
to hem all the manner how she had made peleus to deye by the hands of his two
daughters* and how they seeing the shameful feet commysed by them were desperate
and slew hem self i^ great sorrow / and tellyng this her heart faylled / The
king intended to her: and Jason departed the^s and went to medea which was in
her chamber and said to her: a hadame whereto were yeevyr born^ into this
world / the merits of your benefetes ben great and digne of glory: but your
peruers demerites be^ somoche horrible and fow^^. that they stayne al your
virtues. My dear lord said then^e Medea Ne knowxe not how* peleus sent you
into Colchos by his enhortement for somoch^ as he supposed that ye never
sh^olde have returned / and also ye had been deed without remedy / ne had been
that ye escaped the danger by my counceyle as it is well known / Thise things
considerid and seen that he had no cause to purchase to you such a danger for
ye never deseruid it. wherefore j have many times desired you to take punycion^
upon the desloyall peleus. to which ye would never entende: for it happend that
Peleus had a will for to be reduyte in to young aage / as the king your fad is
by mine introduccyo^ and style but his two daughters have put him to death.
whereof ye ought to be right yoyus / Certes dame a^swerde jason ye say that
pleseth^ you. but ye have do so now (...) also other times that ye shall ^uere
be holden in reproach. and therefore that now and other times ye have commysed
and done to be co^mysed many enorme i^humayne and hydo^se feats: I renon^ce
you in all points: and your company / and command you unto the gods. After
these words jason departed from the chamber sore disconforted / and without
taking leueof the king his faderne of other person he departed allone upon his
horse fro the castle of Pintaquo

When Medea had understand that jason to who^ she had do so much as her seemed
of honor and other things: renon^ced her conpanye. and that she apyceyued
that he had taken his horse* and was allone departed out of the castle / She
took her youngest sone in her arms and two of damoiselles in her company And
in this wise went after jason thinking to repease him by fair words* but the
preu jaso^ was in over great trouble and anger rode all way forth to fore him
so long that he entrid into a forest. And continuelly had his veu and sight to
ward the earth* thinkng on the malefetes of Medea / and of her inhumanytes and
murdres. And he went so far in the wood that medea knew not where he becam
how we^e she returned not to Pintaquo / but sought always jason as long as the
day endured. And at night. she* her child. and her two damoiselles lay under
a tree for the better with sore bewayling

The king Eson did do burye this night his brother peleus and his two
daughters honorably* and made a merua^llocon sorrow for their death / but when
it came at the even and that Medea ne jason his sone came not to him as they were
acustomed / his sorrow doublid in great anguiss^e and i^ great displaisir / and
cessed not all the night to be in great thought and melancolye: When the morning
was come^* he sent out his men into the wood for to seche jason and medea /
but they that so were sent could woot find the^ ne here no tydinges of them:
And the preu jason went always forth also pensif as he might be / and his
adventure was such that after many iourneyes and many ways and champaynes
trauersid as he that tode by day and in the night restid and let his horse
bayte and pasture in the feldes and medo was / he arrived in the cite of
Corinthe* where as waste king of that country named Creante: the which had
then^e a fair daughter named Creasa / Jason went unto this crea^te and gaf him
to knowlech what he was* but creante as soon as he hadd knowlech of him did hi^
much great honor for the loos and good reno^mee that he had gotten by his
right hye valiau^ce in many a royame and country

In cormthe the^e Jason dweld and abode a certam space of time Lteusa that was
a right fair lady* beheld often times Jason. And desired wit good will to be
acco^panyed with him* but jason was so empesshid wit sorrow and of mela^colye*
that he might take none head of hit. And furthermore he was so charmed that in
no wise he might love none except medea. When the king creante apperceyued the
maintene of Jason / and that he made no joye by continuance of time* he ca^ to
him on a day and ^iured hi that he should tell hi^the cause of his anoye and
grief And how well that jason excused him: all way the king oppressid him more
and more / and did somoche by fair words Jason confessid to him the auentures
that were befalle^ between him and medea* and said to him also how he was
departed fro his country / more for to withdraw him fro Medea and to forgete
her then^ for any other cause* but he could not find the manner ne me ne for
to come to his above

The king Creante which was a wise prince knowing the caas of jason by this
that he gaf him knowleche would be his cordyall friend: for be counceylled him
that as soon as he might he should take and wedd a new wife. saying that the love
and new acqueyntan^ce of a new wife should make* him lightly to lose and forgete
the thoughts and Imaginacyons of love and the plaisits that he has had in the
first. Wha^ jason had understand that the king counceilled him wisely. and
that he said to him the secret of the caas he thanked him much / and said
that he would marie him if he could find a wife after his estate. And therewith
he took leave of the king and wythdrew him into his logys / and it was not long
after that he ne returned unto the palace of the king for to see the ladies /
and among all other de began to behold the fair Creusa. And approached to her
weni^g to require her of love / but wha^ it came to the openyng of his mouth:
certes the souuenau^ce of medea came to fore him that took away all his
ente^deme^ts in all points When jaso^ saw this that said is* he arose up from
the^s and entr^o^ into a gardyn where he fond him self so melancoliod and
troubled in his courage that he knew not what he might do best Then^ it
happend that the king anon after came into this gardyne for to reclayme a
sperhawke of his* but he for de jason set under the tree. Then he went to him
for to resone wy him* and jason arose incontine^t as he saw him come / and
then^e the king a^ed him how hit was / and how he felt him / Certes sire
answerde then^ Jason / me seems that I am always in one point* and after said
to him in this wise: Sire j remember well how ye have cou^ceylled me for to
absteyne me to think on Medea: the which is contynuelli in mine ente^deme^t
for to take to wife some new Lady / Wherefore I require you and pray with all my
heart that ye will give to me creusa your daughter to spouse and felawe / and
ye so doing shall do to me the grettest honor and plays^ that may come to me /
For if it be other wise I am the most evil fortuned knight that is in the
remenau^t of the world

Incontinent as the ge^tyll king had vnderstonde^ the request of Jason / as a
prince right yoyous answerde to him and said Certes jason ye do to me and to
al our hows great honor when ye require for your felawe and wyff my dear
daughter / I give to you my daughter / And she is well destyneed and comen in
to this world for you Certes sire I ^^corde your request and give her to
you: With these words the king ^^nte for the guene* his daughter* and for the
baron^s and knights of his court The* ladies and damoiselles as well of his
palais as of his cite were sent fore* and in the presence of all the^ that
there were he made Jason and his daughter to promise that they should wedde and
espouse each other: within a certain terme^that was tho said / and after these
things by thauis of his baron^s knights and the ladies the day of their
espousaylles was ordained and did do make there a feste so fair and notable.
that like^was never seen in all that country / For the king and the queen were
so yoyous of this noble ayll^aunce / as possible was for hem to be: Th^re were
daunces and carolles bego^ne instruments of all maneres and many faco^ns set
a werk / songs and fair dytees songen in the best wise. wine and mete were
plenteou^fy araied and dressed for all the^ that would take. And thus endured
this great and notable feste unto the night / that the king / the queen / jason
/ crensa the Barons / knights ladies and damoyselles departed fro this gardyn
with much great joy: for each man enforced him to make great chere for the
noble aliance of the preu Jason and of the fair creusa / but who that ever was
yoyous or soroufull the youg lady was much conforted and not without cause
thinking on the hye virtues that where i^ the person of the vailliaunt prince
jason

Hou jason espoused the fair creusa the kings daughter of corinthe: and of her
death by Medea


THe Reno^^nee of this wedding of jason and of the fair ^teusa was anon^ sprad
in all the ^o^ aume of Corinthe / The king concluded that he would make a
solemyne feste / and sent the messagers into many and diverse countrees. for to
asseinble the Prices of the cou^ / trees his friends and for to seek clothes of
gold of silk and othre sumptuous and rich things Always for to ensiew^ the
very and true narracion of our matere / during the fya^sayl les and
trouthpligthyng of jason and of creusa / medea that left not night ne day for
to seek her h^^bonde jaso^. as said is* She erred and labored in such wise as
she came unto the m^tes and marches oscorinthe: and well cocluded in her self
that she would go unto Corinthe. And as she went i^ her way she found a
much fair fontayne or well where about satte and were many laborers that at
this spring refresshed the^ / when they apperceyne^ the ladi and the two
damoiselles come unto the fontaine certes they were sore ameruailed to see. iij
so fair women^ / how well they axd hem whyther they went / whersore dema^de ye
said medea. for asmoche fair dame answerde one of the laborers that he will
goo unto the cite of corinthe. and if it plese you to go theder and that our
company may plaise you: we shall gladly hold you company: My friend a^swerde
medea. know ye that our ente^cionis for to go ito the cite that ye speak of /
and that right well plesith us your company With that the noble lady
damoiselles and tho laborers went on her way. and so going one of them began
to behold the lytyl child sone of Medea / that one of the damoyselles bare in
her arms / and wha^ he had a lytill behold the child he said all on hye in
this manner / Ceries j welde that i^ plesid all our gods that my lady
creusa that to morrow come i^. mon^thed might have one so fair a sone by her
lord: Fair friend said then^e Medea / What is that Creusa that ye now speak
of / what is she said the labourer / And why know ye her not and have lived
so long. Certes she is daughter of the king of Corynthe whom shall wedde to
morn^ the most fair knight of all the world: and the most vaylliaunt in
renominee / For hit is he that had conquered I wot never what a sheep or a ram
of gold that men say is passing noble and rich. wherefore we all goo to
geder for to see what feste there shall be. And each of us bear theder of our
goods for to do worship unto the weddyng / The custom at that time was such
wha^ that a king did do marye his sone or daughter / that all the me^ of the
royanme were bounden each by him self for to make a present of vytaylles: And
the marcha^tes and bourgeyses of the cytes made to him an aid of a certain
somm^ of money e and of other goods wherewith they were discharged

Anon then^ as ^a understood this that the labourer spac of the knight that
was so ^ay^and so vailliaunt and that had conquered the flees of gold. she
thought well that it was her lord jason that should so wedde on the morn the
fair creusa: wherefore she was sore troubled. and not withonte cause / how well
she a^swerde not one word. wherefore she thougghte not the less: And in such
wise she exployted that she entrid into Corinthe by fair day. and made her to
be co^duyted unto within the palace of the king into a great ^d fair halle.
where as was (...) and the grettest yoye of al (...) / but ye must understand
that (...) was comen in habyte dissimiled and disguised. And incontine^t as she
was entrid into the halle / she began to look all about if she might see Iaso^
She looked so long that she aspied hi. but her senteth that he had an heavy chere
and was soroufull / then^e was medea sewre that hit was jaso^ that should wedde
Creusa: Then^e began her heart to melte in such wise that there deperted from
the^s many and great plente of sighs. and many teerls deualed and fylle doun^
from her eyes upon her breast And thus doing she thought and again thought
what was to do for the best. And then^e she returned unto the two damoisel
les / and se^te one of them well disguised unto Jason for to require him that
he would come and speak to a ladi that was there.

Then^e the noble preu jaso^ nothing thinkyng on the fair medea heering the
request of the Damoyselle roose up and went with her / and she bronght him
unto Medea / Which was wythdrawen a little a part holdyng her little sone in
her arms / But incontinent as Jason apperceyued her there in that point he was
meruaillously esmayed. And after that Medea had made to him the Reverence in
sale wyng him by all their gods / She said to him in this manner / Alas my
dear lord Iaso^. what have ye entencyon to do: is hit so that to morn^
without longer tarieng ye will take for your wife Creusa whom ye have promised
as I am certefyed: And how my only cordyall love and friend shall I be
sallaryed of such payement in the recompensacion of the salvation of your life.
of which none had been: if it had not be^ saved by my moyen as ye well know:
Is this the merit that ye render to me / Wha^ for your love j have abandonned
the king my fader and all his royaume / Is this the gwerdon that I have
awayted after that I have reduysed by so great labor and trauaylle my lord
your fader the king from his ancient aage unto the yongthe of xxxij. year as
ye well know Ha a Jason right noble and vailla^t knight / I suppose ye hold
well i^ your remembrance all that ye have promised to me: for gods sake
forgete it not and put it not in oubliau^ce And if hit be so that ye will take
and have any other lady than me / Certes I had lever now to lose my life then to
live any longer: sse my: me death be perdonned unto you /

ame answerde then^e Jason. what as to the regard of the weddyng now begon^e /
if it plese the gods. they shall be perfaited and fulfyld as it is ordained
not with stonding any promise that has be^ made between you and me / Wha^
medea herd this answer she fill do^^ to the earth all a swou^ne or in trance
sayng. A ha mine only and souerayn well then^e shall ye be pariured. Certes dame
answerde Jason. Save your honor / I have acquytte unto you / all that I have
promised unto you. For j have brought you i^to my country and solempnly have
espoused you: and syn I have be true in marriage unto the death of mine uncle
peleus. where as ye well know hath^ ben co^mised by you a great defaulte Not
withsto^dyng this that is past j ente^de not that by me ye should be
sclaundrid: But know ye that j had moch^ lever live in honor and ensiewe the
terms and works of noblesse then^ for to hold me le^ger in your company. I
tell you these things for so much as if I held me le^ger by you And of you
ne were done good justice / hit might be said that I should be culpable of one
so cruelle a murdre whereof is ensiewed the death of two so fair and noble
madyens and p^celles daughters of Peleus. And for this cause and other cruelles
by you co^mysed: I shall hold that I have said / And so I may do and ought to
do lawfully in keeping mine honor and the terms and commandments of our law.

When the fair medea had understood all the will and conclusion of the
noble preu Jason: If she hadd be^ to fore sorrowful and over a^gry. yet was she
then^e much more / For she began to weep with thise words and to sighe fro
her heart so perfondly that hit seemed that there deperted from her two fair eye^
two ruysseauls or two spri^ges of a fontaine This notwithstanding after many
sighs from the heart so perfondly she replycqued unto tha^swer of jason and
said / Ha a sir knight I know well now that hit is destyne that I owe to be
the most infortunat lady of the world / If I have ^sented or ^^u^ceylled the
death of the desloy all peleus. hit has been for the great love and true heart
that I have had for tauenge you of this that he by his false cou^ceyll sent you
into Colchos to make the conquest upon the f^ees of gold. knowing that hit was
a thing impossible ever to return wyth^oute to be devoured and ded if hit
had not be my pourneyance. and when I have done all thise things with good
entencion / and for to get your grace / ye will now leave and repudie me in
all points / wherefore I may well say: that under the firmament is no more
infortunat creature i^ all trybulacyo^ then^ I am / Ha a my dear love and
friend Jason shall j have none other salaire ne other gwerdon for all my
merits:

^ertes dame answerde then^ jason / ye have much more then^e ye have deseruid
for such trespaas / such reward. for the couuerture of the trespaas by you
done ca^ not excuse you do the best ye can or may and your children also.
with^drawe you wit your children into some country / and so shall ye do wisely
and also your proffy^ / My dear lord said then^e medea. syn s^t is your
plaisir that it so be / hit must needs be that it plese me / And so be it
always that your plaisirs be^ sulfillid: yet at the lest for to reioye me a
litil: ye shall do to me somoche gce that of your curtoysye I may be loggid here
within unto to morrow to the^de that I may see the solempnite of the wedding.
and if ye will thus accord to me / I promette you that to morn^ at dinner for
the love of you I shall make appear vysibli one of the great meruailles that
ever was seen at wedding of a kings doughtere / or of a prince.

When Jason had understand the request of the ladi. not thinking that she
pretended but unto all well and good. and also for to be quytt of her accorded
her request: and was deliueryd to her a right fair chamber / within the palais
/ And wha^ the lady was in this chamber. she sent her two damoyselles for to be
logged in the town. So hit happend wha^ she was there allone she began to
study in many of her sciences. and when it came about midnyghtshe did her to
be transported into the air. and she brought in to her chamber wit her plente
of works right secret. where of she composed four great and horrible dragons
/ Whom she knetted to gyder by their tailles: and maad as hit had been a
chain: And then^e this done she passed in this poi^t that night / so sore
passioned with Ialousye of love that her seemed that her heart and all her body
were all esprised with fire and fia^be / So hit happend on the morn^ when jason
had espoused the fair creusa and that he was set at diner with her and wit
the king fader of the lady and with the knights ladies and damoiselles of the
countreye / Then^e medea deperted from her chamber sittyng in the mids of the
four dragons holdyng her youngest sone all naked in her hands And in this
point she made her to be brought to fore the table / where as the noble preu
jason was

Ertes hit is well lightli to believe that the king and the noble preu Jason. and
also all they that were there / were greatly esmayed and ferd when they
apperceyued Medea in such array enter into the halle sytting between four
drago^s so terryble to behold by semblau^t / and some there were that fled
And som^e abode to see thauenture / seeing that she held betwen^ her hands
her young child. But when medea saw that she was to fore jason. She escryed him
in this manner Jason Jason. thou know that I am thy wife: thou leuest me for
an other and wenest thy self not to have mesprised to me / I have saved thy
life. and thou doste to me great wrong and ouermoche great blame / And this
proceeds fro the of all desloyalte* and of all mauastie: whereof thou art
chief and heed. And such wilt thou be and abide. but I shall keep the from it
if mine co^ning faylle not For certainly I promise the that thy new wife Creusa
and the king her fader. and al they that be^ here within shall lose their life:
Reserved thy self. and by consequent thy propre sone that j hold in my propre
arms shall be the first that shall begin the feste

When the desolate lady had said these words she holdyng he^r yo^ge child
which was much tender / took him by the two legs / and by the force of he^
arms Rent him in two p^eces / and in that point cast hi in the piater to
fore Jason and creusa. And with that the four terryble dragons of whom she
satte opende their throtes in disgorgyng fire and venyn. so much and so
horrybly that all they that were there deyde miserably and in great torment
reserved Jason / Which might not receive any greef by no venyn by cause of
the blood often the bole / medlyd with the ashes. where with he had been
enoynted: as it is said al a long in the chapitre making mencyon of the
conqueste of the noble flees of gold

THen^e when the noble preu Jason apper^^^^ed the yo^g child so inhumaynly
slain And after saw in his presence dye myserably / and in sorrow his lady
Trensa*the king. the Queen his ^arou^s / knights / ladies / and damoyselles /
Squyers and other by the sorts and enchantements of Medea / he was so over
angry and wroth / that he might no more be. without he had benowt of his mind
/ Then^ he aroos from the table all confuse. and escryed upon Meden sayng: A
sia right evil encha^teresse replenisshed with all evil. certes hit is over
great dommage / that the earth bears and susteyneth you: ye have with your
two hands murdrid your own sone and mine. And syn by your enchantementes
falls and unreasonable ye have maad to deye myscrably and with doloure so many
hye princes. vayliaunt knights ladies and damoyselles and gentil esquyers here
assembled for to do me honor and company: the which did to you never
trespaas ne grief. Haa what horryblecruelte is by you commysed. Certes ye have
not the courage of a woman humayne / but of a best or serpent denourlg all
creatures or ellis of a cruel tyra^te with onte pity. Ha a right perverse and
felon^ courage. what have thou done by thy great oultrage or cruelte what ought
j now to do or where shall j become after that this evil is befallen. If thou
were a man like as thou art a woman perverse and myrrour or chief of all
evil. without longer tarieng I should take vengeance of this this trespaasa^d
grief But for asmoche as thou art a woman. hit shall never happen that my hand
enploye him upon thy body / Considering that a noble man that for any anger or
trespaas smyteth a woman or set hands on her / he lefeth his honor and with
good cause.

When the lady had understand the complaynte of her lord Iazon. She answerde
him and said in this manner. Certes my dear love know ye for troth: that I
had lever see all the world deye Then^e I knew that ye should have habytacion
with any other woman^ then^e with me / ye know how I have employed me for to
preserve you from danger of death. Where many a knight has lost his life to
fore / Also ye know what honor ye have by mi feat gotten perpetuelly: and all
this have I done gladly to thentent that ye should be my husbonde and espouse
all your life during And now j apperceyne that ye will leave and abandonne me
for one other in all estate less then^e I am. Co^sidere i^ what parill ye may
fall by your deffaulte: see well to that ye keep the promise that ye have made
to me / Hold and keep ye hit entierly or ellis Know for certain that the
ve^gean^ce of the gods shall punysshe you

When^e when Jason had understand this that said is. If he were tofore sore
trobled: yet he was now much more. without comparyson^ and in such wise that
he could not one word answer bnt departed out of the halle / And medea with
her four dragons went out also. and went thourgh the cite of Corinthe infecting
men^ women^ and children all a long by the way / Her damoyselles followed and
went after / and all the world f^edd from her save they. which knew well
that it was not well for asmoche as she went so strangely Incontinent as the
desolate Jason was out of the halle. and that he saw medea depart / he called
some of the^ that were escaped from this pestilence, and brought the^ for to see
the king his daughter Creu^a / And plente of other that lay there deed among
the tables upon the benches and on the ground. Hit was much pyetous thing to
see and behold / for the most part of them were swolle^ by the venyn. that
they had received by the conduytes of her noses / and of her mouths / and were
as great as varellis. Then was there made in all the cite a meruayllous sorrow
and dueill. each man began to weep and cast out much pyetouse cries in
cracching their faces / and tering their here: and thus doing. one and other
sought and serched after their parents and friends: that with great pain they
might know hem / for they found he^ so desfigured by the venyn that they were
swolle^ that uneath they might know hem / and when they were drawn out each
a part. they did do burye them right honorably after their estate. And in
like wise the king. the queen / and the fair Creusa her daughter were put in
their sepulture apperteynyng to their estate: Jason was present for to achieue
and do all things / and soyourned there unto the time that the prayers and
cerimonyes were acco^plisshed after the law and custom of that time: and syn
departed from Corinthe and went his wuye. But he was so disconforted and
sorrowful in courage that he might no more be / Thus ryding now an one side and
after on an other side thinking on the meruayles and adventures that he had
had. and above all other things on the great inhumanites and crueltees that
he had seen commysed by Medea by her enchantements. and in an other manner he
deliberid and concluded to ride and err so far / that he might find any
adventure. and reco^forted him self the best wise he could after the
mysaue^ture that he had had.

How Jason Espoused the queen Myrro of Olyfern^ and how he was awayted in a
wood and assaylled by xij. knights of Oliferne / as he was going to Troy: and
how he put hem to death


THe vaylliau^t and noble prince Jason deperting after this as said is fro the
cite of corin the put him on his way and rood through many countrees and cytees
right dolan^t and a^grye / Som^e time he bewaylled the fair Medea / and
sometime after suddenly he remembered her malefices and her crueltes ouermoche
inhunmyne / and in ryding from one place to an other / he was i^ so great
perplexite and sorrow that he might no more. but if he had deyde. and for this
cause he had his entendeme^t so trauailled that he wist not what to do. In this
manner trist and pensyf drawyng from one country to an other hit was told him
on adaye that the king Tollus of elsebee that was his pare^t and of his kyn^
should wedde for his wife the kings daughter of Thessale named Anestor / and
for some what to refresshe him self he concluded that he would go to this

that there should be kings Dukes princes Queen's and nobleladyes in great
nombre: The fair Mirro was come^ theder / with other princesses because that
the king Tollus was her nyghe cousyn But incontyne^t as the kings and princes

other: and that he approached the queen Myrro which was thoo pensyf drew her a
part behind the other ladies and escryed hi^ with an open voys which was well
herd sayng thus /

^a a right evil knight withdraw you jnco^tyne^t from me / have ye forgeten
that ye long syn promised me in athenes that ye should be my husbonde. And yet
ye have do nothing thereto* but have espoused an other lady as it has be^

of my presence: And be never fou^de^ in my way But notwithsto^ding that the
queen had achieued this reprouchable answer / yet he said to her in this
manner / My dear lady I am somoche malewrous and vuhappy that I am not digne to
be founden to fore your noble presence. I know plainly that I have made fault
/ And I can not think how my courage is thus corru^ped and ill cou^ceylled /
for syn I took leave last time of you and when j parted I remember right well
that in my voyage to Colchos I had you always in continuell remembrance. wreton
within my heart hopyng a^ my retornyng to have taken you to my wife. unto the
time that on a cursid night j was sodaynli esprysed wit the love of Medea:
which before had required me to be her husbonde. always I refused* her request.
by ver^yn departed from Corinthe and went his way. But he was so disconforted
and sorrowful in courage that he might no more be / Thus ryding now an one side
and after on an other side thinking on the meruayles and adventures that he had

^a a right evil knight withdraw you jnco^tyne^t from me / have ye forgeten

ye have do nothing thereto but have espoused an other lady as it has be

to be founden to fore your noble pre^e^ce. I know plainly that I have made
fault / And I can not think how my courage is thus corru^ped and ill
cou^ceylled / for syn I took leave last time of you and when j parted I
remember right well that in my voyage to Colchos I had you always in continuell
remembrance. wreton within my heart hopyng at my retornyng to have taken you
to my wife. unto the time that on a cursid night j was sodaynli esprysed wit the
love of Medea: which before had required me to be her husbonde. always I refused
her request. by vernie of the souenau^ce and mind that I had of you.
Notwitsto^ding that she made to me promise to make me co^quere the noble and
rich moto^n with the flese of gold. where never knight went to fore to
co^quere but if helefte and lost there his lyff. I know well that wha^ she
made me thye promise all that day I changed never my purpose ne courage. But
as soon as I was leyd in my bed an evil ^ole^te or will surprised me which was
such in all points that j left your love and ^cluded that I would make of
medea my lady paramours as j did: and for this cause she gafe to me the
introduction and the manner to conquer the noble and rich moton: of whom I
have brought the noble flees on this side the sea / And also I have brought
with me in to Myrmidone Meden no more thinking on you ner on that / that was
concluded between us then^e j had never seen you. But ye shall know what is
happe^d syn / I have take her to my wyff. She has by her cursed enchantemets
and reprochable made mine oncle Peleus deye dolorously And also she is cause of
the death of his two daughters: which is ouerfowle'a vylaynous caas foraladi

^ertes madame said yet jason for these enormites know that I have left and
repudyed her: and in all abando^ned and witdrawe me from her and by an
inestymable. displaysir am deperted from the country / Mine adventure has been
of such condycyon that I have been in the cite of Corinthe. but Medea was all
way in my thought and mind / Then^e seeing that j could in no wise forgete
her and would fayn^ have put her out of mi memory / I took and wedded the
kings daughter of that cite / But in troth medea arrived in the cite eue^
tofore I wedded: and she did somoch that she spack to me. and after many
remo^strances many sighs and be waillges seeing that she might not torn me
ne have other thing / she required me that she might be logged within the
palace / I agreed it not thynkyng that she would do any evil / and when it ca^
that we were at dinner the day of weddyng for tauenge her selff of that I took
an other wife. that she by the virtue of her sorts and encha^tements made
tappere at the dinner. among all the noblesse / her self sytting upon the
taylles enterlaced / and knyt of four horyble dragons castyng fire and venyn
out of their throtes / And held in her hands her yongesi^sone: that I had
engendered of her. and took him by the two legs and tare and ^e^te him in two
pieces / whom she cast into the plater of my wife and me / And after tho same
dragons began to cast fire and venym out of her throtes: in such wise that
she made toldye the king the queen and his daughter sytting at the table. and
consequently al the^ that were in the halle. how well yet I might not deporte
me: but that I think on her inestimnble beauty / and yet I do all the
dylsgence and pain for to absteyne me. whereof j have great marvel. and for
this cause j am entered into ^euerye / that if yt were not that I doubted shame
and suppose I should be diffamed. Certes I doubt that I should be constrained
to take her again

The noble queen myrro heering jason that thus recompted to her his adueutures:
ymagyned lightly that Medea had ensorted and be wicched him / She took a ryng
and deliuerid to him sayng Certes sir knight I am in doubt that medea has be
wycched you with her sorts and enchantements / For right now ye said that she
is enchanteresse. and therefore put this ring on your finger. And j assure you
that if she has made any sorts or enchanteme^ts on you they shall lose all
her puissaunce by the virtue of a p^ciouse stone that is closed within the
gold With these words the preu jason received of the lady this ryng / and put
bit on his on his finger: and then^e forth with he forgate modea. and hadd
souenan^ce of no ladi sauf only of the fair mirro / wherefore he lost his noyous
maintenein such wise that he recouerd all new chere and contenan^ce in somoche
as he began then^e to behold the noble lady with a yoyous chere and said.
Madame j thank you of your ri^g For certaynli syn it has been on my finger / I
have founde^ and felt my self eslonged and alleged of all my sorrows and me
seems that I love none other ladi but you: and therefore j require you right
humbly if in any manner I have trespaced or nusprysed against you: that ye will
perdonne me / And that it plese you: that our compromise long syn made may no
wsorte good effect.

^Ertes sire knight answerde then^ the noble lady: I have here tofore somoche
louid you: that none infortune may in any wise make me to co^ceyue hate unto
you: and therefore see what is your ente^cyon. My dear lady answerde jason / My
desir and ente^. cyon is nothing. but to come to that j may be your husbonde.
if it be to me possible. as I have sym long promised But hit is of necessite
for to conduite this werck secretly. to the^de that me dea be not advertised
the^of For if she knew that ye were mine espouse she should not cesse day ne
night unto the time that she had made you to deye. Certes sir knight answerde
the lady We shall do right well if the defaute be not in you. and shall tell
you how / ye shall come with me after this weddingis: and ye shall put you in
guise of a^uau^tin diffiguring your self asmoche as is in you possible. and ye
shall serve as me abuau^t but wha^ we shall be i^ oliferne / ye may have me
secretli to your wife: and thus medea shall nothing know ne non^ other person of
you and of me And will she or not the strong enchantresse that so long has
holden you in her sorts and in danngeres of her arts. from hens forth we
shall e^yoye the loves of us each other. Then^e the noble preu Jason was
content for to conduyte him self in this manner in all such wise as the queen
Myrro had ordained whereof he was right yoyous For tabregge the matter duri^g
thise weddinges Jason and Myrro often times spack to gyder of their amorettes
and jaso^ received there many fair preisinges which were to long to reherce In
the end the weddynges finisshid and one and other took leave and went home into
their countrees / and so it ought not to be forgeten that jason went to
Olyferne wit the fair mirro in habit disguised as a yeman or a servant and
named him self Sa^bor

Wha^ then^e the lover and the lady had so exployted that they were in
oliferne. the lady logged her lover in a litil chamber not far from her. and
gaf him thoffice for to be her huyssher: and held then^e with her person but
one damoiselle that knew the most part of her secrets / how well she was
acustomed always to have in her chamber four damoiselles / the ordenau^ces and
conclusyo^s made the same day when they were comen. when the night was come^:
and every man withdrawn in his place for to rest The queen whom desire had
long chaced / sent secretly to fecche the priest of their law. and sambor
also. And with litil noise and bruyt she married sambor / and after sent the
priest away. and to the end that he should be secret she gafe hi^ a purse full
of gold She held her spouse in her chamber And then^ wha^ the priest was goon^
and that they were both to gyder: they began in good ernest the deduyte that
is used in the amerouse lyff: And right yoyously they conforted each other. and
demened this amerouse life all the long winter. and so ye ought to bileue that
on the day the preu jason seruid in his office / and in the night he e^tremeted
with this so much gracioas life of love as i^ such chaas apperteyned wit his
lady that louid him meruaillously.

The virtuous prince jason maytenyng him thus in faco^n was not so subtle ne
so well advised that he could keep him from the eye^ of the^ that seruid within
forth / The queen her self could not absteyne her / but tofore the servants
and damoiselles she made to hi^ oftymes ouermoch amerous sembla^ts and
contena^ces. and in like wise made jason to her. and so many apperceyuid hit /
And by especial the three damoiselles which she had put out of her chamber: They
espied i^ such manner this amerous company by a lityl hole that they had made
in the chamber of the lady by which they saw all the feat / how sambor lay
often times i^ the bed wit the queen. where of they were much displaisaunt / for
they knew nothing jason / but thought that he had been som^e vylayne / And one
of these three had a brother named Brutorus that soreloued the queen / but he
durst i^ no wise declare hit: and when this suster of brutorus apperceyued the
conduyt of jason and of Myrro knowing that her brother loved the quenc: despyte
and envy grew in her i^ such wise that she could not kepehit secret. but
called on a day Brutorus and said to him that Sambor did him wrong of his
love / and certefyed to hi^ how she had seen him lie by night with Mirro in her
propre bed.

When brutorus had understand these tidinges he was much pensif / and
conceived a mortal hate against jason. and concluded in him self that he would
murdre him / if he might find him or retain him at his aua^tage / how well
he durst not say so ne make any semblant and was right long in this pain: and
always machyning a right e^venymous will And for somoche bare i^ his stomasi the
desir for to bring the vaylliaunt knight to death And on that other side the
pren Jason that thought nothing but well mayntenyd him right amerously with his
lady the fair myrro / At last the winter passed and the new joly season began
to come / and then^e the noble pren Jason remembrid him that at the e^tree of
the nepte month of Marce the greeks would go with a great arinee to fore Troy
/ where he had promised to be for tauenge him of the great injury and oultrage
that the king had done to him and his felawship. and wit this remembrance he
lay between tharmes of his lady / and began to sighe that his lady herd it.
and she demanded him what him eyled ad said she would know / Jason answerde
that he was grieved at his heart. From whe^s comes this greef or evil said the
lady / Certes madame answered jason. I have not other sorrow at my heart / but
that I have great necessite for to goo into my country in tharmee of them of
Greece / for to take vengeance of a great oultrage and injury that the Troyans
did to me and to many noble knights of greece / wherefore mi dear ladi wha^ it
is so that I must leave you / j have so much anoye and grief / that I may no
more have / but I have promised it. and promys is dew. My friend a^swerde the
noble lady / acquyte you of that ye have promised. I will in no wise retarde ne
let you from you worship ne well / and therefore ye shall ride at your
plaisir unto your country / but wha^ye return again keep you well fro the art
and enchante ments of Medea / Then^e jason promised to her that he so would do
/ and conclude there the day of his deperting And wha^ Jason and the queen
myrro had cessed of speking of this matter the damoyselle that had declared the
feet of her brother brutorus was awayting and aspyeng at the hole* and
understood all that the lady and jason had devised / said and concluded Then^e
she advertised her brother and told to him all that she had vndersto^den and the
day that he should deperte in to his country This brutorus was right yoyous
when he understood these tidinges / and concluded in him self that he would lie
in a wait of jaso^: in a wood by a way by wyche he must needs pass. then^
he called to he^ xij. gentilmen of his knowleche / and told them that sambor
had trespassed to him. and that he would flee him on such a day as he should
depart unto his country. For tabregge the matter when the day was come^ the
noble prince departed with much be wayling of his lady. and went him self
allone by that wood. and he had not long erred and ryde^ in the wood wha^
Brutorus and his xij. felaws without escrie^g or sownyng of any word smote
upon him great strookes and mortalif he had not well be armed at his deperting
as his adventure was he had be deed. and among all other brutorus gaf him a
meruaillous stroke upon the head. that whether he would or not be made him bow
on the lift side

When jason felt him so aduironned and assailed of these traitres and that
they smote upon him on all sides he was all abasshid: Nevertheless he set
him at deffence / and thehe he drew out his good swerd. with which he be
fought his enemies right vaylliau^tly and as a noble knight as he was. But the
place where Brutorus assaylled him over asprely / was in holowe and strayt
passage. in such wise as Jason might not but with great pain help him self.
for the disloyal traitre and his ca^phces were on both sides / six on that
one side and six on that other side / mounted upon hye territoires that henge
over the holowe way: And casted stones upon him. in such wise that they flew
and murdered his horse under him / and in feat they frusshed his helm / and made
him a meruaillous wound in his head / Then^e wha^ jason saw his horse deed /
and that he felt the smarte of the sore in his head he set hi^ a foot all
astonyed: But brutorus and his felawes assaylled hi^ agayma^d cast on him
stones. glayues and swerdes / wherwyt they bruysed and wounded him in many
places. for the horions and strokes came from above / Nevertheless Jason as a
vaylliaunt knight marchyd out over the passage and did somoch that he came into
a right fair land Then^ Brutorus and his folk siewed him so far. that they
came to fight hand a hand: And among all other brutorus approached unto his
evil aue^ ture. For jason smote him upon the top of his helm by such
fierste that he clefte the helm and the heed unto the. teeth that he fille
doun^ ded at his fete

Thus as ye may understand was the disloyal brutorus miserably flayn^ And
then^e when his company apperceyued that he was put to vtteran^ce they escryed
al upon jason and assailed him on a new right anguisshouly in renewyng to hi^
the dolor and great pain of his wounds and frousshures that they made to
him. in the holowe way as said is. and so began the stoure aspre and terryble
How well that jason had more courage then^e puissaunce Always he defended him by
right great vigor in bathing his trenchau^t sword in such wise in the blood
of these xij. murdres that he put seven of the^ to death with Brutorus: And
after foughtlong with the remenan^t / and it fortuned him that in scarmusshing
that he hurt the remenan^t unto the death / as he that escaped not net but
was hurt in so many places that by theffusyon of blood that fill from his
head. his heart faylled him in the^de / and fill doun^ among the deed men The
four last that were left were but lytyl better then^ deed. But what marvel

When the two murdriers had born^ to ground the preu jason / they wend that
he had been deed / and satt down by for to rest them. and after soft and fair
they witdrewe hem: into the cite. as they that with much great pain might
uneath sous teyne he^ self. but for to go unto their howses: they must pass
to fore the palace. The queen then espied them from far / and apperceyued
anon that they were al bespreynt wit blood. whereof she was much esmayed She
dydedoo hem to be called and syn demanded them from whens they came / Alas my
dear lady said one of them. We come from an evil yournee: for Sa^bor and
viij. of our next kyn and friends ben lyyng deed in the wode wit brutorus:
which brought us theder for to lie in a wait for to flee Sambor: the which as
he has said to us / hathdon to hi^ displaysit / but sambor has put us all to
death / reseruid us four / which be^ so pytously hurt / that but jf the gods
inparte to us of their grace. we ben in great danger of our lives

In sayng thise words / two of these four knights deyde there suddenly Whereof
the noble queen was so sore abasshid that her heart faylled and fill doun^ in
swou^ne / that she was born^ into her chamber by her damoyselles and the two
malerous knights were born^ for to be buried after the custom of the country
/ Wha^ the lady was alytyl come^ to her self / by thesforce of the great sorou
that she had i^ her heart. she escryed passing hye and said. Jason / Alas my
love jason and my lord But frowhens sourdeth one so great maleurte or
myshappe: that ye have thus be^ slayn^ i^ the wood The ter rible cruelteof
the^uenimed and so horri ^le bestes of Colchos had no power to grieve thy
person. Ne the sudden parils of the sea / ne also the great* hardines of the
Esclauons / Ha a the right evil Brutorus ye have slain him and he has slain
you. Alas what great loss must j suffer this day / j am born^ in an unhappy
our: when hit must be that I have nourisshi^ the murdrere that traytours^y
has put to death the noble knight jason which is my lord and husbond / Hannoble
and worthy of all worthi / the wailia^^ of all vayllian^^. and he in who^
all virtues habounden. the gods have mercy of thy soul / and if thou be not
over deed. that they will hold the so long alive that I might yet one^ speak
with the. And I shall be much the more comforted that j shall dear more eys^ly
And then^e I desire no longer no line in this world after the.

When the ladies and damoiselles there being had herd and vndersto^de^ of the
queen by her lame^ tacions that he that was named Sambor was Jason / that
somoche was reco^manded in vaylliau^ces and in virtues meruailed strongly for
asmoche as he served as a yeman. and at last comforted the lady the fairest
wise they might And then^e she declared all openly that Sambor was jaso^ the
noble knighte and none other but he had wedded her / and furthermore she
declared for what cause jaso^ had changed his name: and why he mayntened him
as a yeman^ orseruau^t. After this declaracion and lamentacions made / she did
do asseble all the nobles of the cytes / as well men as women. and thus she
sent sole^pnly for to fecche the body of the vailliaunt prince. And commanded
that brutorus and his felawes should be quarterd and honged on the galo was as
traitors. and they that were co^mysed to the^secusion of the justice
accomplisshed hyely their charge and commyssyon / and the company that hadd
charge for to fecche the body of jason went unto the place where the di^soyal
murdre was commysed* But wha^ they were there comen. they found that ja^on was
not yet deed / but he satt up and lened unto one of the traitres. Thus this
noble company seeing that he was yet alive* made to him right great chere and
called him by his name / Sayng that the queen Mirro and they all were so right
^is plaisan^t of his inco^uenye^t that they might no more be / and without
long soyournyng there: they leyd the noble and vailliaunt knight jason upon a
shield which / they fon^de there lye^g upon therthe / and bare him unto the
cite. And the noble Queen came against him. for she had been aduertysed by her
men^ that he was not yet deed: how well she wept much tenderly

When the fair Myrro was come^ nygh unto her lord. and that she apperceyued
that he was so frusshyd and brussijid with stones and staves. certes her heart
faylled: and they that bare jason resrid unto that she was comen again to her
self And then^e she ne Jason might not speak / Jason for the anguisshe that he
suffrid / and she for the great displaysir that she had / at her heart / But it
was not long after that Iaso^ was born^ unto the chamber of his espouse and
felawe: where the best Cirurgyens of the cite ca^ that anon^ visited and
serched his wounds* and fond him in such terms / that they undertook to
render hi hole and sound of all his hurtes and wounds in short time / whereof
the queen was all reco^forted: they faylled not of their promys / for they so
wrought about him by such faco^n that in the space of six mo^thes they
deliuerid him hole and out of danger of all his hurtes and wounds During
which time ofsixe months that the noble preu Jason kept his chamber / as soon
as he might speak and have entendement he began to be waylle the loss of his
time for asmoch as he might not be at the destruction of the king Iaomedon^ and
of the Troyans: Wherefore he had much great displaysir at his heart / For he
had not be^ acustomed gladly to keep: the chambres matted ne stre wed with
herbs and flowers ne the beds encurtyned. the halles hanged with rich
tapesseryes Ne the places magnificque ne sumptuouse as by his feats appere^j /
but he might not amend hit For the noble queen recomforted him always: and
much required hi that he should take no melancolye for no thing / and that he
ne should entende save only to his garisshing and heeling and as for the war
of troy he might in no wise be there

How the king Eson of mirmydo ne asseged his sone jason in the cite of Olyferne
/ And how Medea spak to Jason / and how she slew his oldest sone named Jason.


_^^ ye may understand by thin conuenyent before said the pren Jason was
distourned for tacompanye hercules and the cheualerye of Greece that should goo
leye siege tofore the puyssau^t cite of Troy: wherefore the king Eson and
hercules were right sorouful and abode xv. days le^ger then^e the term that
they had set for to go to the sec: wha^ the / xv. days were past and
apperceyued that they had no tydinges of the coming of jason / they departed
fro the poorte where they had tarried And saylled so far that they arry^ to
fore Troy / with so great no^^ of people that notwithstanding the resistance
of laomedon^ of all the cite and country about / they besieged it / and so
long abode and did meruaillous assaults / that they took hit and destrored it
in the form and manner as is well declared in the history of the xij.
labors of the noble and preu Hercules: And wha^ they had brought this
enterprise to attend each of them departed from thens / and returned into his
country

In the nouelte then^ that the noble king Eson of Myrinydone was returned fro
the conquest of Troy sore trobled for his sone jaso^ that was failled to have
be^ at this hye houour Medea that was not yet come^ again into Myrmydone after
that she was departed the same day that she had made to deye the des^oyal
peleus. as said is Returned then^e unto the king Eson all destayned and
discolored: yclad wy^ clothes all to re^te and lapped / Then^e she set her
down on both her knees to fore the king Ezo^ and after said to hi in this
manner. Sire lo here Medea most pour and the most infortunat lady that ever was
/ or shall be / Thou know and may not deny that j ne am the propre wife of
thy sone jason. whom j made not long syn return gloriously fro the mortal
paril where his uncle peleus had sent him to by his malice This not
withstonding inco^tyne^t and in feat he has abando^ned me syn the day that j
was consenting to the death of the dis^oyall peleus. and I did hit for to take
vengean^ce of this that he sent him traitrously under the shadow of the
conqueste of the rich moton / with the flees of gold which was a thing
impossyble to any creature / human without mine adresseme^t and well supposed
he that he never should have returned but have auaunced his death. and he would
excuse him under the color of this death. the which allewaye I did for his
love* and for tauenge him

Sire said yet the lady. ye know that the day that peleus deyde: your sone
departed from hens much hastily: and how I went after. and hit was so our
adventure that I fo^de him on a day in the cite of Corithe: where he had
fian^ced the kings daughter. And there I spak long wy^ hi^. And among many
remonstra^ces I required him right instantly that he would be true according
to hy^ promys / that he had made in acquityng his faith: But I labored in
vayn. for he would in no wise ente^de thereto / and when j apperceyued that I
could have none other thing of hi I made by the virtue of som^e encha^thements
deye suddenly the espouse / whom he had supposed to have enjoyed And with her
deyde her fader and by conseque^t all they that were in the hall set at dinner
/ reseruid jason whom in no manner j would touch / and after j deperted from
^^e^s and have goon at the aue^ture of the gods not thinking that ever I
should return unto you: thus has fortune be t^ me of such co^dicyo^ that she
has since.ij. months brought me into the cite of oliferne: and there I have
fou^den and seen Jason with the queen Mirro* and it has been certefied to me
that he has espoused her / whereof j have at my heart such dolor and sorou:
that for nothing I might ner could speak with him / but yet am deperted from
the^s and am come unto you: for to require reffuge that in the savor of ladies
it may plese you to have pity of me so desolate a lady / and that in
recoignoissau^ce of the merit that I might have deseruid in redu^ your
ancient aage in the being ^^ xxxij. year: that ye of your sone Iaso^ will do me
right without Rygour.

When the king Eson of myrmydone had understand the doleance and the
r^queste of Medea. and that he saw her i^ so pour estate of habillements that
she seemed all an other woman For she was so discolored lene / and euylarayed.
Certes he had great pity of her: Theu^e he began to reco^forte her and thinking
on the good services that she had dou^ unto his sone whereof all his well and
renommee was comen And in like wise of the great plaisir that she had dou^ to
sum also how she has haba^do^ned the king her fader and her country upon the
pmysse of his sone. Among other words in reco^forting her he said and promised
her that he should punysshe jason of that so great offense. and also he had
taken him i^ desdayne for somoche as he had / failled at the besynes and
destru^io^ of Troy where the cheualerve of greece had gotten great honor*
certes he loved medea meruailous^y and anon he did do clothe her new right
honourabli: and tamynistre to her all that was nedeful and necessary for her:
And wha^ he had so do / he sent into oliferne unto Jason and commanded him
that incontine^t he should come unto his court / but jao^ excused hi to the
messager the most curtoys^y that he might for cause of his wounds that he had
received in the wood not long syn assayd is / and in feat he answerde that at
that p^sent he might go ner yet ride on an horse

Inco^tine^t as the king Eson had understand thanswere of his sone jaso^. he
took it evil in gree / and swear that he would go unto him. but that should be
in arms Then^ he sent into all parties for his friends and alyes / and said
to thaim and she we how he would punisshe Iaso^ for the lauesshenes of his
body. and that by good cause. for because of his luxury he had failled at the
conquest of Troy / and under this couerture he assembled unto the nombre of
ten. M. greeks. whom he brought to fore olyferne the cite / and somoche dydeby
see and by land* that with out aue^ture digne of memory he ca^ on the
cha^panye. where the king of Esclauonye and his ooste to fore had holde^ their
siege to their vnhelthe as hit is said fo fore i^ his place / Always ineden was
come^ in tharinee of the king Eson as she that has in hi all her affyau^ce and
her socourse / as half garisshed or easid

Wha^ the king Eson fo^de him self to fore olyferne / He did do set his
te^tes and pauyllou^s / and sent unto his sone jason that he should come^ unto
hi. for to receive the punycio^ of this disobey sau^ce. certes jaso^ was sore
abasshid and not without cause. when he had understand that his fader se^te for
hi^ to come to hi^ upon this condition And then^ wha^ he apperceiued that his
fad had besieged the cite wy^ armed hand ^he was at that time all helid of his
wounds and frossures: and seeing that said is / him seemed that the king his
fader was angry with him and that he was comen theder al replenisshid with
grete*furour. Notwithstandi^g that i^ no manner he supposed to have deseruid
hit: And considering all thise things / and also by the counceylle of his
friends / for to answer the messager of his fader. he called him and said to
him in this manner. Sir messager I have understand and thought for ta^swere upon
that my fader has sent me by you: on that other side I see how he is here
comen with puissaunce in arms Thise things considered I wot not what is his
entenco^n ne will. Wherefore j am not for this present counseiled to put me in
his hands / how well that I am alwai bou^de^ by al right and holde^ to serve
him and obey his co^ma^deme^ts / and that out of furour / he shall not find
me other disposed

The messager hering the discret answer that Jason gaf him. he acertayned hi
and thereof would abide in hostage. that if jaso^ would take again medea as by
virtue of his faith he was holden: and by the promesses that they had made one
to that other that he should find his traittye and peace with the king his
fader Then^e jason answerde to the messager that if the king his fader were
come^ theder therefore in such ordenan^ce and upon that ente^cion. he abused
him greatly / and that Medea by her encha^teme^ts should never deceyuehi more
during her life. wha^ the messager had understand the will and answer of jason
/ he took leave of him and deperted from the palace / and returned unto the king
his lord. which abood hi at foot of his te^te and told to hi and to medea all
this that he had exployted with his sone jason. The king and the lady Medea
heering his volente and will: and that he was not a man to be meuid and turned
from his courage had a meruayllous sorrow* Then^e the king Eson swear that he ne
his siege should never deperte from thens for cold ne for heete for froste. ne
snow. for rain ne for te^peste that might comen upon him unto the time that
he had subiuged the cite of Olyferne / with that medea when she had herd thise
words. she took leave of the king and returned its her te^te and the^ she began
to study in her e^cha^teme^ts and sorts / where in she wa^ much learned. and
in such wise exployted that in a moment she made her to be born within oliferne
and did her to be set in the ppre halle where jaso^ and* mirro the queen
were at a window spek^g to gydre of their works and in especial of
the^terprise that the ki^ge so^ made upon the^ of which they ha^ great
marvel. and so they wist not what to, think saving that hit were need for
tente^de to forte^ye the muraillelwalles of the cite / the tours and yates to
garnisse with stones and wit shot. and to deffe^de their strength wit all
their power / But jaso^ and mirro had the gretest marvel of the world. and
not wit out cause: wha^ so sodaynli they saw Medea there appear in their
presence / Then^e medea ope^d this that she had in will to say and declare
playnli and said in this manner

^a^ Alas sir Jason have ye not entencio^ tame de your life. which is much
reprochable tofore the gods and the world: and cursed be the our and theday
that j saved and wara^ted you fro the death. wha^ for my reward and gwerdo^ I
must suffer somoch and in so many manners as I do / and that in that time and
i^ place ye know not her to who^ ye be so greatly bou^de^ and holde^ / Dame
a^swerde then^e jaso^ shall your sorts ne encha^tementes never cesse / I can
not think how ye have the hardiness^ to com^ to fore mine eyen^ seen that i^
my p^se^ce ye have murdered one of my sons. and how a^swerd then^e medea. Am I
alady born^ in so unhappy an our and so i^ fortunat that in no manner I dare be
founde^ to fore mine espouse and husbond / and him that holds hye life of any
other but by me. A jaso^ said yet the lady. the great goodness that I have done
for you tofore this tune is little reme^bryd and known by you / which I did
all of good heart. and if I have s^ayn^ your child. ye be only culpable: for ye
do to me so many displaisirs and anoyan^ce / that I can not think how the
heart of any lady so desolate as I am may so long endure

Certes dame answerde then^ Jason I hold no, thing that ^ have don to you
despleisi^ ne anoye in no wise y e have ^mysed and made many enorme and right
evil caas / For which I may lawfully repudie and aba^do^ne you in all points.
how well that for the love of me ye have dou^ that I ne maintene not. and of
that other side speak no more to me. lo here the noble lady that I had ^mys^d to
fore that I arrived in your country: and during the time that I have been with
you and ye with me. ye put me by your enchau^^eme^ts in such point that I had
al forgete^ her and thought on none other but on you / whether ye were fer or
nyghe: and in this astate was I a long space of time and til that the gods
have resemblid this lady and me by your great defaute The which have now
espoused. this is my lady and j am her lord and husbo^de / and as long as the
soul shall abide i^ my body. j shall be beers* and shall not withdraw me from
her^ner shall took other then her for nothing that may befall me / and otherwise
ye shall not find it: and therefore abide no longer here. for if yedide it
should be all tymeloste for more to poursie we this enqueste Medea wit this
conclusion made her to be born^ from thens also suddenly as she was comen And
in that same n^ght she was delyueryd and rendryd at pintaquo in the chamber
where her little sone Jason was nourysshed* and there she being fulle of a
Right tiers: and demanded (...) had seen him. and there (...) answerde for
certa^yn that at the our of mydnight jaso^ was issued out allone by that gate
/ and more he knew not / Wha^ the nobles of olyferne knew thise tydi^ges they
were sore trobled and not without cause / for they beheld that they had no
lord ne lady. And that therefore ones they must submyse them unto the king
Eson. and took heeir counceyll to gyder and concluded to yield them and the
toun^ sau^ their lives and their gods Then^ they chese twayn of the most
noble knights of the cite and most propice to the erande / And sent hem unto
the noble king Eson: that made with all dylige^ce his things ready for
tassaile the Cite in many places: And when they were comen to fore him and
salutacyon made. they told hi^ first that the queen her lady was deed and putt
in sepulture. Secondly they said to him that Jason was goon^ out of the cite.
and wyste not into what place Thyrdly that the cite was without lord. and
fynably they said to him. that fortune was such for the^ / that they of the
Cite demanded but pees and that they were content to constitute him king upon
them by condition that he should ne touch their lives ne meuable goods what
som^e ever they were

Wha^ the noble king Eson of mirmydone understood that his sone jaso^ was so
deperted. he was right soro^ feat (...) that they (...) made to cesse (...) him
for tentre (...) te of olyferne. and hit (...) wha^ they of the cite (...)
their cite: and in the (...) their king and gaf him (...) his heed. and made
(...) and feaulte: and by this (...) king Eson king of olyfer^^ (...)
myrmydone: After these (...) ne and accomplisshed He sent m^ knights after
his sone Jason for (...) seche and find him / but they lost their time / For
they returned unto their lord without reporting tidings of him / For Jason
went ryding fro country to country by many yourneyes where he had ple^te of
meruayllou^ adue^tures / which were to long to reherce: of who^ the^de was
such wha^ he had long time erred and travailed i^ the world he was in great
desire to come and see the king his sad and cry hi^ mercy. for asmoch as he
had disobeyed his conmau^dem^nt and mespryfed against him / whereof he was right
sore repe^tan^t Upon this conclusion the noble preu jaso^ put hi^ on the way
so far that he came in to Thessaylle. But that more is. fortune made him e^tre
in to the great wood. where as Medea hadd long ben and soyourned (...) / And
(...) in his way ^oun. Anon as (...) each other forth (...) each other: With
(...) began strongly to weep / ^elyd down on both her ^ete humylite tofore
jason (...) and cryeng hi^ mercy Their (...) had pity on her and releued ^er up
by the hands. and syn de^ded her if she had any thing to (...) or drink /
sayyng that he had ho^ger. and that he hadd not that day eten ne dronken Then^e
medea made him sit upon the earth for to rest him a lytyl and sy^we^te and
fette him of the notes akehornes / and roots. and other small fruytes that she
hadd gadred in the wood. and said to him that he should make good ^here with
such as h^founde / And that sith a certain time that she had been there: she had
eten none other wise mete

When Jason which was a much virtuous prince had understood the lady and
knew her great pouerte he began to remember: of the i^numerable good deeds.
that she had dou^ for hi^ tofore and how she had for his love* abandonned her
fader and her nation for to goo with hi^. And also that (...) was of anoble
house as daughter ^ke her by the hand and (...) he perdonned her of a^ thing
that she had trespaced or mesprysed against him: and in feat said that his
pla^sit was that she should be his wife again as she had been tofore / Certes
medea incontinent as she understood the good will of her lord. she was more
yoyous in her courage then^ if he had given to her the bes^e and he most noble
royaume of the world / and then^ she swear to him and auowed that she should
never meddle more with sorts ne enchanteme^ts ne none other male^ices ne of any
thing (...) first he should have the cognoissaunce and knowleche: and in such
wise she conduysed her self against Jason that in that time they reco^cilled he^
self to gyder: and went both on their way. and so far erred by their
iourneyes that they came unto the court of the king Eson of Myrmydone that was
newly comen in his royaul^e / Theu^ the noble king Eson knowing their
reconsilyacyon contented him self wit his sone Jason / in pardonnyng him alse
old Rancour and maletalents. And hit was not long after that the noble king
Eson resygned in the hands of his sone Jason the noble Royaume of Myrmydone /
for the much and great love that he had unto the fair meden as he well shewde.
For incontinent that he knew that she was arrived in his palace. he received
her the most yoyous^y and honorably that was in him possible to do: and thus
the preu Jason and medea reigned and governed their royame hyelilong time /
duri^g the which they lived to gyder i^ great love and co^corde / and had many
fair children to gyder that reigned after hem: of whom^ j have fou^de^ none
history or sentence. and therefore j shall fynisshe this history in this wise
/ prayng my fore said right redoubted young lord and all them that shall read
the contenu of this present volume. or here it red that it may plese the^ of
their grace to excuse me for somoche as my lytyl and rude engyn has not cou^e
touch ne co^pryse the matter. etc and here ends mine auctor his book ANd how
be it that mine Auctor writes that he has found no more of thistorie of jason
/ yet have I fou^de^ and red i^ the book that bocace made of the genelagye of
godaes in his. xiij. book / that wha^ so was that jason and medea were
reconciled again to geder after that she fled from egeon that he went with her
into colchos again And when he was comen theder / he found the old king oetes
fad unto medea ban^issed and exiled out of his royame. whom he restored and
set hi^ by his hye vailliaunce and puissaunce in his kingdom again. and after
went ito asie / where he had victory i^ many batailles. And made so many
co^questes with great magnificence in so much that he was honored and
worshipped for a god and were made and edifiod diuerce temples in his name.
Which after we^re destroyed by the com^andeme^t of king Alexa^d of m^cedone:
who per au^ture had envy of his glory. and also he saith^ that thoa^t and

another country for to be nourisshed / wherefore the mother was put out of her
royaume: and taken wit pirates and thieves. and after sold unto Ligurgys king of
nemee / and after when the said sons wax men they went wit king Adrastus
unto the hataile of thebes / and as they went in the wode of nemee they herd of
the said king adrastus rehearse her burth and the caas of her mother. by which
rehersaill they knew that she was their mod. and i^ king Lygurgis court they
