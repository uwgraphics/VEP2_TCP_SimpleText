woodcut depicting the punishment of two people (one in the stocks and one tied
to a tree) enduring punishment The example of evil tongues.


WIth pity moved to my pain I did me dres
To show ye people what does the^ most greua^s
I say ill tongues full of bitter crewelnes
In this world may be no greter penance
These be ye clappers of sorrow ye skorges of vengans
These preuy morderers these co^berous hell wedes
Because of great meschefe and dystroyers of good dedys
If there were in ye world none other punyshement
But ill tongues only in especyall
Of very right it were suffycyent
Seyenge how every creature now over all
Is suddenly smyten with this venomous spear mortal
Of comberous tongues that god ne man dredys
Because of myschefe and dystroyers of good dedys
Both rich and poor be brought in torment
By this cursed slo worm yt swells worse tha^ a tode
I mean the ill tongue that venymous serpent
Which many good doer destroyed with a word
Who ledeth their life now in peasyble concord
Full few for ill tongues so much sorrow bredys
They be cause of myschefe and dystroyed good dedys
No enemy so little we out him to doubt
Ne none so great rome but remedy may be found
If it in time be perceived and brought out
Than to a good end it may rebounde
But an ill tongue so broad renrieth the sound
Fro bad to worse and so myschefe spedys
Which caused many a man to wtdrawe good dedys
The tongue is instrument of lies treason and treachery
And causes war morther myschefe without end
Great multitude of other with ypocrysy
Rebellyons theft dyscorde full ill to defend
Fighting chiding to strife ever Intend
With shame and sclaunder to ill fortune all ledes
Lo how ye tongue caused myschefe and dystroyed good deeds
Some thieves escapen and many true men be hanged
It is daily seen in this world round
Faithful people by ill tongues be condemned
That to untruth there dydes never did found
But he that comes in danger of an ill tongue
Seldom or never he scapeth there fro
For by an ill tongue the good name is soon a go
And this ill Joint of most dyspyte
Sormounteth all venyme of serpents fell
They have such malycyous appetyte
They may be lykened to the fend of hell
The sorrow yt by them is rered no man may tell
The true servant put out of favor yt is pity and woe
For by an evil tongue ye good name is soon a go
A false tongue will ever Imagyne and say
That never by creature was said ne thought
And this has be seen and is every day
The fader and mother betraye and in sorrow brought
Many good folk has sclaunder dear bought
As lost their goods and their lives also
For by an ill tongue the good name is soon a go
Many there be that never did offend
Which by an evil tongue is brought to dysshonoure
And in to an evil name sone they be comptende
That a. M. to their good name cannot them restore
The claterers co^dycyon is to gross up more and more
Maidens by them is blamed wedowes and other mo
For by an evil tongue the name is soon go
There is many one blamed and accused for naught
And many gyltles their lives fro them is take
Ye and a thousand into pouerte brought
That daily goth a begy^ge and prayed for gods sake
And all through tale tellers his scrowe does wake
Which caused many one their self to slo
Where by an evil tongue their good name is a go
Full many be brought to dyseas and captyuyte
In every regyon that man can trauayll
The tongue is causer of this woeful aduersyte
Full little or naught now does troth auayll
True heyers be dysheryte without any fayll
With weeping and waylynge some waxes blind
And all causes evil to^ges most enemy to ma^ky^de
Though some priests now be never so pacyent
And in town and cite be pease over all
Or though the relygyous be never so obedyent
Yet an evil tongue will trouble them all
Multyplyenge of lesynges by him arise shall
To trouble good people in soul and mind
This is evil tongues most enemy to mankind
If any man would begin his sins to reny
Or any good people that fro vice did refrain
What so ever he were that to virtue would apply
But an ill tongue will all overthrow again
Lo by whom is raised all this great pain
Of sorowefull sclaunder that flies as the wind
These ill tongues be most enemy to mankind
I say not but war is great abusyon
Yet is there not so many as is with ill tongues slain
And though honger be never so sharp for ye season
Yet for all that god some people does sustain
Of frostes great some people be not feign
But so sore grefe no where may we find
As it the ill tongue most enemy to mankynge
Though sudden death be never so rygorous
Yet by priests it seaseth at the last
But where all ill tongues list to be malycyous
There is never remedy when the word is past
To lie and say wrong they be never aghast
Of heaven and hell they have little mind
I mean ill tongues most enemy to man kind
Speak of salpeter arsnek or any poison mortal
The fire of hell the blood of serpents venymmous
Ye find none sone so peryllous among all
As is the ill tongue to them that be virtuous
They be of malice so full and rygorous
For they yt list to do well and there o do their pain
By the evil tongue all is overthrow again
Therefore every creature take heed what ye say
For if the word be escaped at any throw
It will not be called again though you would lay
Both life and goods and on it bestow
I would wete how we a good tongue should know
It will not be for by the subtle train
Of the ill tongue which all overthrows again
Men shette surely their chystes with silver and gold
With dyuyrs Iulles of great comodytes
Furred gowns in grain right goodly to behold
Yet were they better to keep their adversaries close
The ill tongue and set all the other lose
For many has purposed to amend with heart feign
But an ill tongue overthrows again
For that ill by another does say
If he his own defautes did well behold
How many times himself is out of the way
Full gladly than his tongue keep he would
For if pykethankes their own fautes se should
To their hertes it would be a great pain
For by ill tongues all virtue is overthrow again
All people beware of these ill tongues most peryllous
And eschew them where ever you go
Tongue breketh bone he is so malycyous
And none has himself all knows it is so
Sclander comes lightly which causes great woe
For though thou be in name I tell the plain
By an ill tongue all is overthrown again
These comberose clamores in every town
That thing which the devil can not bry^ge about
An ill tongue will perform by unkind perolysene
If a thousand fendes were to gyder in a route
Could not by their malice such falshede vter out
To bring the people to great dessensyon
As does these ill tongues man's most confusyon
O enuyous tongues destroyers of hye and low degree
Thy wicked seeds thou do sow down
Here and else where over every country
Both in cite borowe vyllage and town
Sease thy rorynge thou fendly lion
In the coffer of science hyde the full soon
For ill tongues is man's most confusyon
He that can keep his tongue and beware
Laud unto him shall ever increase
And where that ever he go he need not to care
For he is sure of rest and pease
More of this matter I need not rehearse
For take these words for a conclusyon
That ill tongues is ever man's confusyon
Amen.
