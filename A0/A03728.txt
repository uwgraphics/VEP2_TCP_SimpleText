The fyfte Eglog of Alexandre Barclay of the Cytezen and vplondyshman.

Here after follows the Prologe.

IN cold January / when fire is comfortable
And that the feldes / be nere intolerable
When sheep and pastoures / leueth field and fold
And draw to cotes / for to eschew ye cold
What time the verdure / of ground and every tree
By first and storms / is pryuate of beauty
And every small bird / thinks the winter long
Which well apereth / by ceasynge of their song
At this same season / two herdes / fresshe of age
At time appointed / met both in one cotage
The first hight Faustus / the second Amyntas
Hard was to know / which better husband was
For each of them both / set more by pleasour
Than by habundaunce / of riches or tresour
Imyntas was tormalle / and propre in his gere
A man on his cloak / should not aspyed a here
Nor of his clothing / one wryncle stood a wrye
In london he learned / to go so manerly
High on his bonet / stacke a fair broche of tynne
His pursys lynynge / was simple poor and thynne
But a lords stomach / and a beggars pouche
Full ill accords / such was this comely slouche
In the town and cite / so long getted had he
That from thens he fled / for det and pouerte
No wafrer / tavern / halehous / or tauerner
^o him was there hid / while he was hosteler
^te was he hosteler / and than a wafrer
Than a coster monger / and last a tauerner
About all London / there was no propre prym
But long time had been / famylyer with him
But when coyne^ayled no fanour more had he
^^^erfore he roas glad / out of the town to fle
But shepeherde Faustus / was yet more fortunate
For always was he / content with his estate
Yet nothing he had / to conforte him in age
Save a^ melche cow / and a poor cotage
The town he used / and great pleasure had
To se the cite / oftyme while he was ladde
For milk and botter / he thither brought to sell
But never thought he / in cite for to dwell
For well he noted / the mad enormyte
Envy / fraud / malice / and such inyquyte
Which reygne in cytes / therefore he led his life
Up land in vyllage / without debate and strife
When these two herdes / were thus together met
Having no charges / nor labor them to let
Thryr sheep were all sure / and closyd in a cote
Themself lay in lyttre / pleasauntly and hot
For costly was fire / in hardest of the year
Ioha^ men have most need / tha^ every thing is dear
For passing of time / and recreacyon
The both delyted / in co^munycacyon
Famely they pledyd / of the dyuersyte
Ofrurall husbondes / and men of the cite
Fa^tus accused / and blamed Cytezyns
To them imputynge / great fautes crime and sins
Amyntas blamed / the rural men again
And each of the^ both / his quareyl did maynteyne
All worth despised / all malice and ill will
Clean laid a part / each did rehearse his skyll
But fsyrste Amyntas / thus for to speak began
As he which counted / himself the better man
Finis Prologe.
Interlocutoures be Amyntas and Faustus.

Amyntas first speaks.
THe winter snowes / all covered is the ground
The north wind blowys / all with a fereful sou^de
The long yse sycles / at the hewsys honge
The streams frosen / the might is cold and long
Where botes rowed / now carts have passage
From yoke the oxen / be lowsed and bondage
The ploweman rests / avoid of all business
Save when he tends / his harms for to dress
Mably his wife / sytteth before the fire
All black and smoke / clothed in rude atyre
Seething some grewell / and sterynge the pulment
Of peese or frument / a noble meet for lent
The somer season / men counts now laudable
Whose fervor before / they thought intolerable
The frosty winter / and weder temperate
Which me^ tha^ praised / they now dyspryse and hate
Cold they desired / but now it is present
The braule and grutche / their minds not content
Thus mutable men / them pleased can not hold
At great hete grutchy^g / and grutchy^g wha^ it is cold

Faustus. All pleasure present / of men is counted small
Desire obtained / some counts naught at all
What men hope after / that seems great and dear
At light by dystaunce / apereth great and clear.

Amyntas. Each time and season / has his delight and Joys
Look in the streets / behold the little boys
How in fruit season / for Joy they sing and hope
In lent echeone / full busy is with his tope
And now in winter / for all the grievous cold
All rent and ragyd / a man may them behold
They have great pleasure / supposing well to dyne
When men ben busyed / in killing of fat swyne
They get the bladder / and blow it great tand thyn
With many beans / or peasen bound within
It ratleth / sounds / and shyneth clear and fair
While it is thrown / and cast up in the air
Echeone contendeth / and has a great delight
With foot or with hand / the bladder for to smite
If it fall to gronnde / they lift it up again
This wise to labor / they count it for no pain
Rennynge and lepynge / they drive a way the cold
The sturdy plowmen / lusty strong and bold
Ouercometh the winter / with dryuynge the foot ball
Forgetynge labor / and many a grievous fall

Faustus. Men labor sorer / in fruyteles vanyte
Than in fair warkes / of great vtylyte
In such thryftles / we labor for damage
Warke we despise / which brings advantage

Amyntas. Towchynge their labor / it can not me dysplease
While we be in rest / and better here at ease
In the warm lyttre / small pain has little hyre
Here may we walowe / while milk is on the fire
If it be crudded / of bread we need no crome
If thou bide Faustus / thereof thou shalt have some

Faustus. Winter declares / hard need and pouerte
Than men it feleth / which have necessyte
Treuly Amyntas / I tell the mine intent
We fond young people / be much improuydent
We straye in somer / without thought / care / or head
Of such thing as we / in winter shall have need
As soon as we here / a bagpype or a drown
Than leave we labor / there is our monaye gone
But when the north wind / with storms vyolent
Has brought cold wy^ter / pore wretches to turme^t
And void of leaves / is every bow and tree
That one may clearly / the emty nestes se
Than is all our woll / and lambs gone and sold
We tremble naked / and dye almost for cold
Our sholders all bare / our hose and shows rent
By retcheles youth / thus all is gone and spent
This comes for wantynge / of good prouysyon
Youth dayneth counsel / scornynge dyscrecyon
When pouerte thus / has caught us in his snare
Than does the winter / our mad folly declare
Now treuly Amyntas / I tell the my mate
That town dwellers live / gretely more fortunate
And somewhat wyser / be they also than we
They gather treasoure / and riches in plente
They spoil the lambs / and foxys of the skin
To lap their wombes / and fat sides therein
In lust in pleasure / and in good habundaunce
Pass they their lives / we have not suffysaunce

Amyntas. The men of the earth / be fools euerychone
We poor shepeherdes / be not to blame alone
More folly vexes / the man of the Cite
I grant us ouersene / they madder be than we
Though I long season / did in the cite dwell
I favor it not / truth bare I boldly tell
Though Cytezyns he / of living reprouable
Yet fortune to them / is much more favorable
Fortune to them / is like a mother dear
As a stepmoder / she does to us apere
Them she exalts / to honor and richesse
Us she oppresses / in care and wretchydnesse
What is bayne fortune / but thing bytuperable
An unhappy madness / unworthy and unstable

Faustus. No doubt Amyntas / let me be fortunate
And than shall I soon / become a great estate
My coin shall increase / than shortly shall I be
Called to office / to govern a cite
All men shall here me / and give me credence
The comonte bareheed / shall do me reuerente
All other rules / low men and comonte
Shall gladly desire / to have advise of me
If I be happy / and fortune on me smyle
Thus shall I assende / and mount within a while
Ask thou of Cornyx / declare to the he can
How coin more than co^nynge / exalts many man

Amyntas. O Faustus Faustus / thou erres from the way
This is not fortune / full little do she may
Though I myself / rehearsed but lately
That fortune has might / a man to magnyfy
I keep the opinion / of wytles comonte
And grounded myself / on none auctoryte
It is not fortune / that grants excellence
True honor is won / by virtue and science
If men get honor / by other polecy
It is no honor / but wretched mysery
God makes mighty / god gives true honor
To godly persons / of godly behauyour
God first dysposed / and made dyuersyte
Between rude plowmen / and men of the Cite
And in what manner / Cornyx thine own mate
As we went talking / recounted to me late

Faustus. What told the Cornyx / /tell me I the pray
He had good reason / such things to conuaye
His wit was pregnant / no reason did he want
But trouche to declare / his monaye was but scant
But what than / some man has pleynte of cunning
Which has of richesse / small pleynte or nothing

Amyntas. In herynge my tale / if thou have thy delight
Than take some labor / for now is good respyte
Faustus arise thou / out of thy lyttre hot
Go se and vysyte / our wethers in the cote
Arise go and come / thou art both young and able
After grate cold / hete is more comfortable
Go man for shame / he is a slothful dawe
Which leueth profit / for pleasure of hot straw

Faustus. Think not Amyntas / that Fastus has dysdayne
To do thy pleasure / I shall refuse no pain
Look here Amyntas / lord benedycyte
The cold snow recheth / much higher tha^ my kne
Scant may the houses / such burden well sustain
Less hurt is tempest / and sudden storm of (...)
On top of the chymnaye / there is an hepe of (...)
So hye extendynge / our steple is more low
The snow is so whyre / and the son so bright
That plainly Amyntas / amasyd is my sight

Amyntas. Give to the bestes / good rowen in pleynte
And stop all the holes / where thou can fautes se
Stop them with stubbyll / este daube them with some claye
And when you have done than come again thy way
Naught is more noysom / to flock / cotage / ne fold
Than sudden tempest / and unprovided cold
What now all ready / friend Faustus here again
By short conclusyon / bad warke apereth plain
Thy coming again / me think is all to soon
Ought to have mended / or profit to have done.

Faustus. This combrous wether / made me more dylygent
I ran all the way / both as I came and went
And there I spedde me / and took the greter pain
Because I lightly / would be with the again
After great cold / it is full sweet god wot
To tomble in the straw / or in the lyttre hot
Now be we Fastus / in hey up to the chynne
Fully thy promise / I pray the now begin
Tell the beginning / of the dyuersyte
Between rural men / and men of the cite
I know the reason / and talking of Cornyx
But sith I him saw / be passed years six
His socunde Iestes / made me oftetyme full glad
Our first acquayntau^ce / was when I was a ladde
Now speak my Faustus / and I shall hold me still
Till thou have ended / and spoken all thy will

Amyntas. This great dyfference / and first dyuersyte
Betweue rural men / and them of the cite
Began in this wise / as cornyx me told
Which well could common / of many matters old
First when the world / was fourmed and create
And Adam with Eve / were set in their estate
Our lord conjoined them both / as man and wife
To live in concord / the season of their life
And them commanded / mankind to multyply
By generacyon / to get them progeny
They both obeyed / this sweet commandment
With faithful hertes / and labor dylygent
But would to Ihesu / they had been wise and ware
From yt fatal fruit / which kyndled all their care
But to my purpose / first Eve had children two
A sone and a daughter / our lord dysposed so
And so year by year / two twynnes forth she brought
When god assysteth / man works not for naught
By such manner / these two did them apply
The world to fulfill / encreace and multyply
At last our lord / at end of fyftene year
To Eve our mother / did on a time appear
And in what manner / now here me Amyntas
Adam on the field / forth with his wethers was
His flock than he fed / without all dread and fere
Than were no wowers / him nor his wife to dear
He was not troubled / that time with Ielowsy
Than was no body / to do that vylany
No horned kyddes / were living at that time
Long after this / began this cursed crime
Than was no cocko / between the eest and west
To lay wrong eggs / within a strange nest
Than none suspected / the living of his wife
Weclocke was quiet / and pleasant without strife
But after when people / began to multyply
Than first was kyndled / the flame of Ielowsy
For that man commynteth / sore dredeth he again
Fraud fereth falshode / suspectynge often in vayn^
A thief suspecteth all men of felony
Brekers of wedlock / be full of Iolousy
And therefore all such / as with sword do stryke
Fere to be served / with the scaberde like
Thus while that Adam / was pytchynge of the fold
Eve was at home / and sat on the chressholde
With all her babys / and children her about
Other on her lap / within or else without
Now had she pleasure / them collynge and bassynge
And e^te was she busy / them lowsynge and ke^my^ge
And busy with butter / for to anoint their neck
Sometime she musyd / them pleasauntly to deck
In the mean time / while she was occypyed
Our lord drawing nere / she suddenly espied
Anon she blusshed / reuoluynge in her mind
That if our lord there / should al those babys find
So sone engendered / supposing he needs must
That it was token / of to great carnal lust
And all asshamed / as fast as ever she might
She hasted and hid / some of them out of sight
Some under hey / some under straw and chafe
Some in the chymnaye / some in a tubbe of draffe
But such as were fair / and of their stature right
As wise and subtyle / reserved she in sight
Anon came our lord / unto the woman nere
And her saluted / with sweet and smiling chere
And said woman / let me thy children se
I come to promote / each after his degree
First was the woman / amasyd nere for dread
At the last she commanded / the eldest to proceed
And gave them comfort / to have audacyte
Though they were bolder / and doubted less than she
God on them smyled / and them comforted so
As we with whelps / and birds use to do
And than at the last / to the most old of all
He said have thou Ceptre / of rome imperyall
Thou art the eldest / thou shalt have most honor
Justice requires / that thou be emperor
Than to the second / he said it is semynge
That thou be haunsed / to honor of a king
And unto the third / he gave such dygnyte
To guide an army / and noble duke to be
And said have thou here / hard iron and armoure
Be thou in battle / a heed and a gouernoure
And so forth to other / as they were in degree
Each he promoteth / to worthy dygnyte
Some made he earls / some lords some barons
Some squyers / knights / some hardy cha^py^os
And tha^ brought he forth / the Ceptre and the crown
The sword / y^ pollax / the helm and ye haberiowne
The stremer / standarde / the getton / and the mace
The spear / and the shield / now Eve had great solace
He gave them armoure / and taught them polecy
All thing to govern / concerning chyualry
Than made the Iuges / mayres and gouernoures
Merchants / shreues / and other protectoures
Aldermen / burgeyses / and other in degree
After the custom / of court / and of Cite
Thus all the children / than being in presence
He set in houour / and rowme of excellence
Oftyme reuoluynge / and tournynge in his mind
The caduke honors / belonging to mankind
In the mean season / Eve very joyful was
That all these matters / were brought so well to pas
Than flesh in have / for to have pleasour more
And them presented / whom she had hid before
And vnrequyred / presentynge them said she
O lord these also / my very children be
These be the fruit / also of my womb
Hyd for shamefastness / within my house at home
O lord most mighty / hye fader cretour
With save to grant them / some office of honor
Their here was ruggyd / poudred all with chafe
Some full of strawes / some other full of draffe
Some with cobwebbes / and dust were so arrayed
That one beholdynge on them / might be afraid
Black was their color / and bad was their figure
Uncomely to sight / mysshapen of stature
Our lord not smyled on them / to show pleasaunce
But said to them thus / with trowbled cou^tenau^ce
Ye smell all smoky / of stubbyll and of chafe
Ye smell of the ground / of wedes nnd of draffe
And after your sent / and tedyous sauoure
Shall be your rowmes / and all your behauour
None can a pytcher / turn to a silver piece
Nor make goodly sylke / of a gotes flece
And hard is also / to make withouten fail
A bright two hand sword / of a cowes tail
No More will I make / how be it that I can
Of a vile vylayne / a noble gentylman
Ye shall be plowemen / and tyllers of the ground
To pain and labor / shall ye always be bound
Some shall keep oxen / and some shall hogs keep
Some shall be thresshers / some other shall keep sheep
To dyg and to delue / to hedge and to dyke
Take this for your lot / and other labor like
To drudge and to dreuyll / in warkes vile and rude
This wise shall ye live / in endeles seruytude
Wyppynge / and mowynge / of fother gras and corn
Yet shall town dwellers / often laughe you unto scorn^
Yet some shall we grant / to dwell in the cite
For to make podynges / or butchers for to be
Cobblers / or tynkers / or else costard Iaggers
Hostelers / or daubers / or drowpy water laggers
And such other sort / whose daily business
Passes in warkes / and labor of vylenes
To stowpe / and to sweet / and subject to become
And never to be rydde / from bondage and thraldom
Than brought our lord / to them the carte and harowe
The gad / and the whyp / ye matoke and the whelebarow
The spade / the shouell / the forke and the ploughe
And all such towles / than bad he them be toughe
And never to grutche / at labonr nor at pain
For if they so did / it should be thing in vain
Thus said the father / and lord omnypotent
And than he ascended / up to the tyrmament
Thus began honor / and thus began bondage
And dyuersyte / ofcyte and vyllage
And seruyle labor / first in this wise began
Demand of Cornyx / declare the truth he can
This told me Cornyx / which dwelled in the fen
I trust his saying / before a thousand men

Faustus. Is this the matter / praised of the so sore
A straw for fables / I set by them no store
It were a marvel / if Cornyx matter told
To laud of shepeherdes / or plowmen to uphold
He dwelt in the town / and held with the cite
Till need him mouyd / as it has driven the
When none of you both / dare to the town resort
Among us shepeherdes / yet find ye here conforte
So both thou and he / be gretely for to blame
To ete our vytayle / and than to hurt our name
The young men of towns / to mock us have a guyse
Naught else can they do / save lies to deuyse
This vain inuencyon / and folysshe feigned fable
Again rural men / they have delight to babble
And naught they asshame / as bly^de wretches unwise
Of god almighty / such leasynges to deuyse
This scorfy scoftynge / declares openly
Against rural men / rebuke and injury
But thou art so rude / thy paunche is so fat
Again thine owneselfe / thou busy art to chatte
A life this same Jest / is thy rebuke and blame
Thy dullyd reason / can not perceive the same
But I wall prove the / that rural people be
More wise and noble / than they of the cite
And that the cite / is full of fraud and strife
When we in vyllage / have good and quiet life

Amyntas. I pray the Fastus / herefore be thou not worth
To have dyspleasoure of the / I were right loathe
I thought no mawgre / I told it for a bourde
If I had known / I should have said no word
But say thy pleasure / now tell forth thy sentence
And I shall here the / with sobre pacyence

Faustus. I shall not deny / our pain and seruytude
I know that plowmen / for the most part be rude
Now shall I tell the / high matters true and old
Which curteys Candydus / unto me ones told
Naught shall I forge / nor of no leasing babble
This is true hystory / and no surmysed fable
At the benynnynge / of things first of all
God made shepeherdes / and other men rural
But the first plowman / and tyller of the ground
Was rude and stordy / dysdaynynge to be bound
Rughe and stoborne / and Cayn did men him call
He had no mercy / and pity none at all
But like as the ground / is dull / stony / and toughe
Stubberne and heavy / rebellynge to the ploughe
So the first ploughman / was strong and obstynate
Froward self willing / and mouer of debate
But the first shepeherde / was meke and nothing fell
Humble as is a lamb / and called was Abell
A sheep gives milk / and little has of gall
So this good Abell / had none ill will at all
No shepeherde found him / iniuryous nor wrong
In during his life / while he was them among
And often of his flock / made he good sacryfyce
Of calfe or lambs / such as were most of price
And of fat wethers / the best not spared he
To honor our lord / and pease his deyte
Thus had he favor / with god omnypotent
So pleasynge our lord / that to this time present
From first beginning / of erth^ and man mortal
God has had favor / to people pastoral
And poor shepeherdes / their cotes / field and sheep
Aungelles have come / for to defend and keep
Some shepeherdes were / in land of asserye
Thiche after have been / promoted very hye
So that from cotes / and houses pastoral
They have ascended / to dygnyte royal
Chargys and labor / so does my reason blind
That call their names / can I not unto mind
Yet let me stody / avoiding perturbaunce
So mane I call them / unto my remembrance
^o now I have them / Abraham / and I^cob
Lot / Isaac / younger / Joseph / and Job
These now rehearsed / and all the patryarches
Have not dysdayned / pore sheep nor herdes warkes
Them has our lord / called from humble things
And made them princes / dukes / other kings
So have they changed / their clothing pastoral
With golden garment / purpure / and gaye pall
And than have after by magnanymyte
Brought noble reyalmes / in their captyuyte
And have in battle / ben mighty conquerours
Won fame immortal / and excellent honors
Paris was pastor / the sone of Pryamus
Pan / Sylene / Orphens / and Ioly Tyterus
Sawll was shepherde / so was he in likewise
Which would have offered / his sone in sacryfyse
Moses was shepherde / and was his flock keeping
When he came barefote / unto the busshe flamynge
Co^mannded by god / to leave his flock and go
On gods message / to sturdy Pharao
Also Apollo was hard / sometime in Greece
Nothing dysdaynynge / to handle ewe and flece
As writes poets / he left dyuyne honor
Glad among wethers / to be a governor
The blessed aungelles / brought to such men as we
Message of concord / of peace / and unity
And song that gloria / styenge in the sky
Which our sir Sapson / does sing so merely
First had shepeherdes / sure tydynge by message
That god was made man / to bye hamayne lynage
And herdes instruct / by voice angelycall
Saw god incarnate / and brone first of all
And this was pleasour / of gods majesty
That simple herdes / him first of all soulde se
And in their manner / make unto him offrynges
Before estates / as rich and mighty kings
The ioly harper / which after was a king
And slew the gyaunt / so stoutly with his slynge
Was first a shepeherde / or he had dygnyte
Right so were many / as stout and bold as he
And our lord Ihesu / our god and savior
Named himself / a shepeherde or a pastor
Right so he named / men meke and pacyent
His flock and his sheep / for manners innocent
Think not these words / glosyd nor in vain
They are the gospel / so says sir Peter plain
I saw them myself / well painted on the wall
Late gasynge upon / our church cathedral
I saw great wethers / in pycture and small lambs
Dauncynge / some slepynge / some sowky^ge of their da^mes
And some on ye ground / me seemed lyenge still
Than saw I horsemen / at pendant of an hill
And the three kings / with all their company
Their crowns glywerynge / bright and oryently
With their presents / and gifts mystycall
All this beheld I / in pycture on the wall
But the poor pastoures / as people innocent
First saw the Cryb / of our lord omnypotent
Thus it apereth / god loves poor pastors
Seth he them granted / to have to great honors
Our lord has favor / both in the sheep and fold
As it apereth / by the hostoryes old
Our lord is ready / to socour the vyllage
Despysenge towns / for malice and outrage
For god is content / with simple pouerte
Pride he despyseth / and wrongful dygnyte

Amyntas. In good faith Fastus thy tale is verytable
Grounded on learning / and greatly commendable
Lately myself / to se that pycture was
I saw the manger / I saw the ox and ass
I well remembered / the people in my mind
Me think yet I se / the black facys of ynde
Me think yet I se / the herdes and the kings
And in what manner / were ordered their offrynges
As long as I live / the better shall I love
The name of herbs / and cytezyns reprove
Wherefore mate Fastus / I pray god give the care
If thou the fautes / of any cite spare
Speak on / and spare not / and touch their error
Yet may me common / more than a large hour.

Faustus. Than turn we to talk / a while of Cysezyns
To touch their folly / and parcel of their sins
Think not Amyntas / that they of the cite
Live better life / or wyselyer than we
All if their clothing / be doubled for the cold
And though they glyster / so gayly in bright gold
Shynynge in sylkes / in purpure / or velvet
In furryd robys / or clokes of scarlet
And we poor herdes / in russet cloak and hode
It is not clothing / can make a man be good
Better in in rags / pure living innocent
Than a soul defiled / in sumptuous garment
Trust me Amyntas / my self with these same eyes
Have in the cite / such oftentimes seen
Iet in their sylkes / and brag in the market
As they were lords / I often have seen them Iet
Which are stark beggars / and live in need at home
And often go to bed / for need with empty womb
Naught is more folysshe / than such wretches be
Thus with proud port / to cloak their pouerte
What is need clohed / or feigned habundaunce
Pouerte / slouthe / and wretched governance
What is fair semblau^ce / with thought and heaviness
Forsooth naught else / but cloked folysshnes
And some have I seen / which is a thing damnable
That while they would have / a lyuy^ge delectable
Best at their pleasure / and fare delycyously
Have suffered their wives / defiled wyttyngly
Have sold their daughters / flower of vyrgynyte
O deed unworthy / O blind inyquyte
Fame honor the soul / and chastyte be sold
For wretchyd living / o cursed thurst of gold
O damnable deed / so many for to spyll
One wretchyd carkes / and belly for to fill
What thing is vyler / what more abhomynable
What thing more folysshe / more falls and detestable.

Amyntas. What if they can not / to other craft them give
Nor find ather way / or means for to live
Need has no law / of two ylles parde
To chose the leest ill / is none iniquyte

Faustus. Seth they have as many / souls as have we
As much of reasone / and hands like plente
Why may they not / to honest warke the^ give
And find other way / and manner for to live
No law permytteth / nor wylleth man parde
To commyt mordre / for hard neressyte
No More should any / his soul defyle nor kill
For lust transytory / or pleasure to fulfill
Yet be in cytees / mo suenge folysshnes
Wenynge by craft / for to have great riches
By which crafts / no man has riches found
Sith time yt our lord / first fourmed man and ground
As Alkemystys / wenynge by polecy
Nature to alter / and coin to multyply
Some wasshe rude metal / with lycours many fold
Of herbs wenynge / to turn in to gold
All pale and smoky / by such contynuall
And after labor / they lose their life and all
An other sort is / to this not much unlike
Which spe^de their times / i^ wretehyd art magyke
Thereby supposing / some treasour to have found
Which many years / is hid within the ground
What is more folysshe / more full of vanyte
Or more repugnynge / to faith and probyte
Because they woldeste / good business and pain
They use such tryfles / and wretched things vain
They prove all things / because the would do naught
Still seky^ge news / still troubled i^ their thought
Because they woldeste / the labor of the land
All idle tryfles / such takes on their hand
Still be they busy / and never come to end
To thing profitable / do few of them intend
Some live by rapyne / gyle / fraud and polecy
Pariury / oppressyon / and some in usury
Some gladly borowe / and never pay again
Some keep from servants / ye stipe^d of their pain
Some rest men gyltles / and cast them in prison
Some by strong thieves / out of the dongyon
Some fawn some flater / man trust not wha^ they smyle
Than frame the frauds / men slyly to begyle
Some in one hour / more promise to the will
Than all his days / he thinks to fulfill
By thousand means / of fraud and craftynesse
Ly they in wait / for honor and richesse
They feed the rich / and often let the pore
Dye for pure cold / and hungre at their door
We feed fat oxen / they Marmosettes keep
We feed fat Kyddes / Lambs / and good sheep
And they feed hawes / apes / also hounds
And small is their Joy / save here wtin our bounds
We bring them butter / eggs / chese / and woll
Tancardes of mylde / and cream fletynge full
All manner flesh / and all their hole living
Without our labor / treuly they have nothing
We are the feders / of wethers and fat hogs
And they of the cite / feed birds / and great dogs
Now Judge Amyntas / which of these seems the
Of most advantage / and most nobylyte

Amyntas. If by your labor / proceeds more richesse
And most auau^tage / as seems truth doubteles
Than this I marvel / that they of the cite
Have so great pleynte / and we necessyte
The cause can not I / call to my remembrance
Whereof proceeds / their store (...) abundaunce

Faustus. The cause I told the / what would thou have more
By fraud / and falshode / have they so mykyll store
See thou not plainly / how they of the cite
Daily dysceyueth / our poor symplycyte
With that cruelte / against us they rage
By falls oppressyon / or fair feigned langage
They think it pleasoure / that sorrow on them hap
By glosed words / to take us in trappe
The most of them all / count it an alms deed
Us herdes to fraud / this is a gentle mede
For them we labor / in hete / wind / cold and rain
And fraud and dysceyte / the pay us for our pain
With minds and tongue / they stody and they muse
Both day and night / us herdes to abuse
Their wit and body / all hole do they ply
For us poor wretches / to stody polecy
And after their fraud / gyle and decepcyon
Than do they laughe us / unto derysyon

Amyntas. Now came thou to knowledge / of this enormyte
And of these manners / of them of the cite
My self there ^onned / and there was couuersaunt
Of some of these things / yet am I ygnoraunt

Faustus. Thou could not perceive well / their enormyte
Parchau^ce thy manners / did with their life agree
There seldom is seen / great contradyccyon
Where men accords in dysposycyon
No fault with moryans / is black dysformyte
Because all the sort / like of their favor be
So couthe thou not se / their vices nor them blame
Because thy own life / was fyled with the same
But how I know them / now shall I tell to the
While I brought butter / to sell to the Cite
And other vytayle / I used milk to cry
Than had I knowledge / with an apotecary
Of him I learned / much fashode and practyse
Not to the purpose / the same to excercyse
He couthe make playsters / and new co^myxcyons
In valor scant worth / a couple of onyens
Yet sold he the same / as it were gold so dear
Namely / if happened / any infectyfe year
I was aquaynted / with many an hucster
With a costardemonger / and with an hostler
This thief was crafty / poor people to begyle
None like I suppose / within a dosen mile
Among all other / his frauds and his crimes
He sold one botell / of hey a dosen times
And in the otes / couthe he well drop a candell
Well knew he how / his gestes for to handle
And in the same In / there dwelt a pretty pryme
She couthe well flater / and gloss with him and him
And neck a mesure / her smyrkynge began her sale
She made ten shylynge / of one barell of ale
Whom she begyled / in pottes she was feign
To win them with flesh / and painted look again
And as I remember / her name was wanton besse
Who leest with her dealt / he thryued not the less
What need more process / no craft of the cite
Is but is myngled / with fraunde and subtylte
Save only the craft / of an apotycary
That is all fraud / and gylefull polecy
But all these would swear / that they were innocent
Or they to the cite / did first of all frequent
There learned they / theft and fraud to exercise
And man of nature / is moved soon to vice
Some (...) also / which spend their patrimony
Which was to them let / by their old auncestry
On queanes / bawdes / in riot and dronkenesse
Their name defylynge / despysynge all goodness
With cost and pains / such busuly labor
Seeking for shame / and death before their hour
Sa^^ where is custom / of fornycacyon
Incest auoutry / and defloracyon
Forsynge of women / murdre and rapyne
Dyscorde and braulynge / nnd living like to swyne
Malice / envy / and all iniquyte
Do these not rain / in mids of the cite
All new abusyon / provoking men to sins
Had first beginning / among the cytezyns
Where dwell great princes / and mighty governors
Their life dyspysynge / for to have vain honors
Capytaynes / souldyours / and all like company
Which put for money / their life in ieopardy
These dwell not upon land / but haunteth the cite
Pore herdes fight not / but for necessyte
For lyberte / life / and justice to uphold
Town dwellers fight / for vain honor / and gold
We fight / our friends / and household to defend
They fight for malice / to riches to ascend
Our cause and quarrel / is to meynteyne the right
But all on self will / without reason they fight
They seek by wounds / for honor and richesse
And drive the wekest / to hardest busynes
O blind sowdyour / why set thou thy heart
For a vain stypende / again a mortal darte
By thousand peryllys / thou take thy passage
For a small Lucre / rennynge to great damage
Their sweet life they give / for a poor stypende
And often lose they both / and heaven at the end
While some contendeth / and fyghteth for his wage
His life he spends / than fare well advantage
What is more folysshe / or lyker to madness
Than to spend the life / for glory and richesse
What thing is glory / laud praysynge or fa^^
What honor report / or what is noble name
Forsothe naught but voice of wytles comonte
And vain opinion / subject to to vanyte
Proceste of years / reuoluynge of season
Brings all these / soon in oblyuyon
When life is faded / all these ben out of sight
Like as with the son departs the day light
They all be fools / which medleth with the sea
And otherwise might live / in their own countr^
He is but a fool / which runs to tempest
And might live on land / in suerte and in rest
He is but a fool / which has of good plenty
And it dysdayneth / to use and occupy
And he which lives / in care and wretchydnes
His heir to promote / to lands and richesse
Is most fool of all / to spare in mysery
With good and lands / his heir to magnyfy
And he which leueth / that thing for to be done
Unto his daughter / executour or sone
Which he himself / might in his life fulfill
He is but a fool / and has but little skyll
But all these sorts / within the cite be
They want of wisdom / and sue enormyte
And also the youth / in days festyuall
Do naught but follow / their lusts bestyall
The weke they use them / in worldly business
The sunday serves / to follow vycyousnes
What time the shoppes / be closed all and shyt
Than is the market / with Thays / Beale / and Kyt
On highest days / such ware in namely sold
For naught it waxes / if it be ones old
Npo^^he sunday / when men should god honor
L^^ is good labor / ensued is error
Oftyme the old friar / that wonned in grenewyche
Again such folyes / was boldly wont to preche
He said where baudes / and their abusyone
Were wont to abide / in one vile place alone
Now are they sprencled / and sparcled abroad
Like wise as ships / be docked in a rode
That hard is to know / good women from the ill
By ill example / good are in doubt to spyll
Bawdes be suffered / so where they list to bide
That the street fades / upon the water side
Cate / Iyll mably / Phylys / and feat Ieny
Because of the cite / now can not get one penny
Vile Thays was wont / in angles for to be
Now has she power / in all the hole cite

Amyntas. Thou pasest mesure / Faustus by god a vow
Thou say of malice / right well perceive I now
Mytygate thy mind / and tongue for it is shame
Men of the cite / thus largely to blame
What man is fautles / remember the vylage
How men vplondysshe / on holy days rage
Naught can them tame / they be a beastly sort
In sweet and labor / having most chief comfort
On the holy day / as soon as morn is past
When all men rests / while all the day does last
They drink / they banquet / they revel and they Iet
They lepe / they dance / despysynge ease and rest
If they ones here / a bagpype or a drone
Anon to the elm / or oak be they gone
There use they to dau^ce / to gambaud / and cor^ge
Such is the custom / and use of the vyllag^
When the ground rests / from rake plough and wheles
Tha^ must they it trouble / with burden of their heles
To Baccus they banquet / no feast is festyuall
They chyde and the chat / they vary and they brall
They rail and they route / they revel and they cry
Laughing / and lepynge / and making cups dry

Faustus. What stynt thou thy chat / these words I defy
It is to a vylayne / rebuke and vylanye
Such rural solace / so plainly for to blame
Thy words sounds / to thy rebuke and shame

Amyntas. Not so friend Faustus / I spoke it but in game
Again to the cite / return in gooddes name

Faustus. Yet of the cite / mo foles tell can I
Which wene to nombre / the sterres of the sky
By them supposing / each desteny to tell
But all be fools / that with this matter mell
Yet be they madder / which fyxeth their intent
To search the nature / of god omnypotent
And dare be so bold / to set their mortal sight
On incomprehensyble / and pure immortal light
Our faith is better / for they of the cite
Believe by reason / with great dyffyculte
Or they will believe / they brawle with argument
Plain speech suffyseth / us people innocent
Again sir Sampson / their quarrel they defend
We ask no questyon / and use not to contend
We light the alters / and many candels offer
When they of the town / skantly make a proffer
The ^ayth is feeble / our faith is sure and stable
They dare be bold / with doctors for to babble
A worldly merchant / naught knowing of doctrine
Because of his coin / counts his reason fine
Trust me Antyntas / no force who hereth me
The coin and conning / does not always agree
For some be that have / great pleynte of that one
Which of that other / have little part or none
What should the foles / that dwell in the cite
Or we seek to know / of gods pryuyte
If it were needful / the godhed for to know
To simple wretches / here on the ground allow
It is in power / of god omnypotent
His very presence / to us to represent
But seth his knowledge / is comprehensyble
Why seeks fools / for things impossyble
And seth god will be / unknown unto us
Why should thine mortal / of endeles thing dyscus
And ruyall people / in almys does excel
Above all the sort / which in the cite dwell
We give woll and chese / our wives coin and eggs
When freres flater / and pryse their propre legs
For a score of pynnes / and nedles two or three
A gentell cluner / two cheses had of me
Phylys gave coin / because he did her charm
Ever sith that time / less has she felt of harm
Yet is in the cite / a nombre incurable
Pleders / and brokers / a foul and shamefast rabble
Merchants of Justice / hunters of riches
Cratchers of coin / delayers of process
Prolongynge causes / and making wrong of right
And right of plame wrong / opp^uyng law with might
Iaylers of Justice / their cursed couetyse
Watreth the plants / of cruelte and vice

Amyntas. This have I proved / by plain experyence
But tell me Fastus / what causes this offense

Faustus. The rote and the ground / of this mysgouernaunce
Is favor reward / and wylfull ygnoraunce
When coin or favor / ones dymmeth has the sight
Adieu all Justice / in prison laid is right
Yet be in towns / a rabble fraudelent
Murdrers of people / and fre of ponysshement
Vauntynge and bostynge / themself of medycyne
And naught perceynynge / of science and doctrine
If they be fetred / with rings and with cheynes
Than may they handle / and touch pryuy veins
Name all dyseases / and sores at their will
Avoid of conning / of reason other skyll
Such ride on mules / and pages by their side
But if they had right / on asses should they ride
As touching rulers / of all the comonte
The more that they have of hye auctoryte
Of lyberte will / and synguler pleasure
So much the more / poor people they devour
The hounds sometime / wont foldes for to keep
Be now wild wolves / devouring all the sheep
Rulers be robbers / and pyllers be pastors
Gone is the guydynge / of godly governors
O where be rulers / meynteyners of Justice
Where be subduers / and slakers of all vice
Where he the friends / of mercy and pity
Sometime well rulynge / not spoylynge of the cite
When ^e chaste rulers / just meke and lyberall
Changed is fortune / death has devoured all
The worste remains / gone ben the meke and Just
Instead of virtue / rules frewyll / and lust
where be the fathers / right worthy an empire
Of whom men counted / gaye talys by the fire
Sometime with talys / and otherwhyle with song
So dryuynge a way / the winter nyghtes long
Alas Amyntas / naught bydeth that is good
No not my cokers / my tabert / nor my hood
All is consumed / all spent and worn be
So is all goodness / and welthe of the cite
The temples pylled / does bytterly complain
Poor people wayleth / and call for help in vain
Poor wydous sorrow / and children fatherles
In vain bewayleth / when wolves them oppress
Syn has no scourge / and virtue no reward
Who loves wisdom / his fortune is but hard
Counceyll and cunning / now tombles in the dust
But what is the cause / law turned is to lust
Lust stands instead of law / and of Justice
Whereby good living / subdued is by vice

Amyntas. I tell the Faustus / this hastynes of the
Passes the bonds / of right and honest
All men thou blamest / by wroth and hastynesse
As all cytezyns / were full of vycyousnesse
What man remember / some live in innocence
Some in the Cite / be partles of offense

Faustus. I am not angry / I say but veryte
Here me Amyntas / one clause with breuyte
As many todes / as bredeth in Irelonde
As many Grypes / as bredeth in England
As many Cockowes / as sing in January
And nyghtyngales / as sing in February
And as many whalys / as swymmeth in the fen
So many ben there / in cytes of good men

Amyntas. A good man is geason / not easy to be found
On land or in cite / or over all the ground
Many things long / unto a parfyte man
Ask that of Codrus / declare the truth he began
Badnes increases / and over fast does grow
Goodness and virtue / in coming up ben slow

Faustus. Thou art mad I trow / so many foes have we
As dwell cytezyns / in all the hole cite
They clyp us / they poll us / they py^ us to the skyn
And what they may get / yt think they well to win
To theft they constrayne us / I tell the by all Halows
And after by and by / they send us to the Galows
Therefore it is reason / if ought of theyrs hap
Or come to our claws / it pryuely to trap
They us often dysceyue / dysceyue we them again
Deuyse we slyly / gyle subtle and train
But this Amyntas / to me is gretest grefe
And doubt for it is ill / stelynge from a thief
If it be secret / we may it well deny
If it be known / excuse it craftily
Preue felony / though it be used long
Is not called theft / but injury and wrong
All that they have / within these towns plain
(...) hard labor / sore travail and great pain

Amyntas. Now thou exeedest / the mark of equity
Thou passest reason / Faustus I tell to the

Faustus. What than Amyntas / have pacyence a while
Town dwellers vices / does all the worle defyle
The air is corrupt / by their enormyte
These somer storms / whence come they tell thou me
Lyghtnynge / great wyndes / flodes / hayle / and thundre
I well remember / ofttyme the ground here under
Right sore has quaked / and caused houses fall
Vice of the cite / is rote and cause of all
The son in myddaye / oftyme has lost his light
In likewise the moon / in season of the night
Both has been black / or else reed as blood
This sign Amyntas pretends us no good
Why grow the wedes / and cokyll in the corn
Why is hay and grass / oftymes all forlorn
Why lose we our sede / our labor und expense
Where comes moryen / and grievous pestylence
All these proceeds / by mad enormyte
And corrupt manners / of them of the cite
And wors is lykely / yet after ward to fall
If they not refourme / their living bestyall
Whence came the furour / of harnes and battle
Which causes wydowes / their spouses to bewail
Which brings with it / all kind of mysery
As theft / and murdre / great death / and penury
Forsooth in cytees / this furour first began
To the confusyon / of many a doughty man
The cite is well / and ground orygynall
Both first and last / of dedelyylles all
Bredde in the cite / was cruel Lycaon
Bredde among herbs / was good Dewra^y^
Among shepeherdes / norysshed was Rennus
And also his brother / the mighty Romulus
The cause of the flode / in Cite first began
Whereby was wasted / nere every best and man
Our lord dsteroyed.v. Cytes for outrage
Read where for sins / he wasted one vyllage
I trow when the world / with fire shall wasted be
The cause shall proceed / and come of some cite
What shall I touch the savor and the stynke
Which is in cytes / of gutter and of synke
There men be choked / with vile and deedly ^^nt
Here have we odor / of flowers redolent
I count me happy / which won in the vyllage
As undefiled / with Cytezyns outrage.

Amyntas. Have done now Faustus / lay there a straw and
Fill we our belly / with cruddes that is best
Leave we the cite / and all Cyuyle outrage
Now it is season / to torn to the potage
After our dinner / is best as in my mind
The rest to declare / if ought remain behind.

Finis.
